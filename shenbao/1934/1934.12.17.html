<h3>財界某要人談白銀出口問題</h3>
<p>偷運方法巧妙百出</p>
<p>當局識破弊實制止</p>
<p>（南京）　財界某要人云、吾國全國存銀、多半集中上海、去年有一時期曾超過八萬萬、國内銀行儲存佔六分之三弱、國外銀行佔六分三强、今年六月起、因受美國膨脹政策影響、國外銀價逐漸上升、美金大縮、英金不動、中外投機份子因有轉運以獲大利之可能、於是乃利用雄厚資本、一方吸收市面現銀備運、一方將存庫現銀輸出、截至現在止、流出究有若干、非調查所能得其詳確數字、現在所知者華商銀行存額約有二萬萬五千萬至八千萬、外商銀行所存者則較此數爲弱、是外商銀行之流出、較之華商多至三分之一强、上海銀拆因受此影響、高漲至二角以上、月前尙在迴旋之中、雖因年關關係、但過去均未出此囗囗、足見影響到現在尙未泯滅、至財部頒佈銀出口稅及平衡稅率後、海關輸出之現銀、表面似覺减少、但在過去兩三星期中、實質並未减少、彼等偷運方法、巧妙百出、一方利用轉口辦法、一方利用走私辦法、北方以天津爲根據地、南方以厦門爲根據地、實行其秘密輸運之計劃、更有利用中央銀行鈔票到處兌現之便利、以爲輸出現銀之媒介者、蓋彼等於上海收集中央銀行鈔票數萬以至數十萬元、携往北平天津兌現後、卽由長城各口運送出關、轉往大連或其他港口出國、其後中央銀行查出此中弊賣、改以支票兌現、凡數目過多之兌欵、非爲銀行、卽爲銀號、儘可持支票向上海劃撥、當地不予現銀對換、是項巧妙方法、雖被識破、但其藉長城以爲輸出根據地、則始終一仍其舊、最近始因華北各埠同時禁止携帶過額現銀、逾限卽予没收、並由當地政府與海關會同辦理、已收相當效果、但完全絶跡、則仍不可能了、救濟現銀流出問題、過去曾一度風傳將白銀收歸國有之說、但此事已經財部予以否認、可知並不確實、可靠消息、財部認爲目前流出白銀、並不過多、尙無採取進一步辦法之必要、萬一偷運之風不息、則財部儘可以平衡稅之伸縮緊急的制止、譬如倫敦銀價漲一便士、則平衡稅亦可按照一便士之核價升點、使除出匯價運費以外、無利可圖、卽買出匯票亦不可能、反之如倫敦銀價續縮、則平衡稅亦可降低、至適合於低價之度數而止、美國自羅總統實行澎漲貨幣政策以謀國内生産之增進後、本年上年度（六月）起、卽已盡量吸收現銀、截至現在止、此項政策仍舊不變、除美洲爲銀區之白銀早已爲其集中外、東方之現銀如中國印度等處、亦爲其目光照射之地、此項澎漲政策是否單純的爲復興産業、或另含有國際貨幣戰爭之用意、無從得知、九月間我國曾向美國務院提出抗議、但白宮之答復、則僅承認考慮不妨中國之貨幣政策、其後施肇基公使亦曾數度與美國務卿赫爾作相互間的談話、但眞正態度、仍難明瞭、故白銀出口問題、實已牽涉及於國際貨幣戰爭、似又非可認爲單純牟利行爲也（十六日專電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>勗國貨工業</h3>
<p>年來國貨工廠。外受輸入品傾銷之打擊。内感農村市面衰頽之影響。勉强撑持。已覺煞費苦心。而瞻望前途。隱憂未已。現在經濟先進各國。除法西外。莫不放棄原有之金本位制度。爭相减低其幣値。希圖衝破關稅墻壁。發展市塲而我國關稅尙未完全實行保護制度。各國在華。又多有政治上特殊權利。其市塲物品價格。復常在國内出品之下。故我國貨工業。乃更陷於困境。如絲織品棉紗棉布等。卽其最顯明之例證。設再不努力奮發。恐今後將更無奮發之時機矣。蓋現時力謀經濟穩定之國。日本爲最。英國次之。日本對外。惟以减低貨幣價値。實行其通貨膨脹政策。再加以軍需工業之刺激。英國則以開拓殖民地市塲。團結英帝國之經濟聯盟爲主眼。此種形勢之推進。均各有其一定限度。過此以往。卽難免不促成另一方面之經濟恐慌也。至産業最發逹之美國。迄今猶滯在恐慌波浪之中。故現亦正向海外推銷製造品。以爲解脫之計。其餘各國。又皆指向遠東。羣以我國爲當世惟一市塲。則我國國貨工業。處此四面圍攻之下。欲打開出路。圖國内市塲之穩定。使海外輸入品失其競爭之能力。菲具卓越之精神。經長期之苦鬭安能有望乎。</p>
<p>夫我國非無可有爲之國也。人力物力均有特殊之優點。惜未充分發揮。故時覺捉襟見肘耳。現在内地各處。尙滯留於手工業時代。以農業爲主幹。卽上海等大都市之發逹。亦僅具近工業之雛形。以是一般工資極低。出品亦不如外貨。設令再加改良。對工人加以適當之訓練。則出品自佳。始可與外國輸入品競爭。再則我國原料豐富。隨地皆是。所可遺憾者。未嘗加以開發整理。國内交通又多滯遲。以致種種優點往往爲外商所利用。已國反退居其次。甚至僅知以轉輸販賣爲能事。疏忽將來之發展。卽如我國有如許羊毛駝毛城市中以毛織品爲衣料者又甚普遍。在理毛織工業必可欣欣向榮。乃亦竟讓外貨獨步。其他工業與此相類者。正復不少可勝浩嘆。要之。國貨工廠宜先就原料來源。作深切之考究。對於其出品之銷路。須注意其是否爲日常生活所必需。吾人願就思慮所及。致其忠告如左。</p>
<p>第一。欲求一工業發展每須相當之時期。而在發展過程中之困難。又每多出於意料之外。是以負籌劃之責者。宜具遠大眼光。而自近處着手。不可虚張聲勢。不可過度誇大。先植根基。徐圖擴展。經相當時期後。乃可與外貨相競爭。</p>
<p>第二。我國國民經濟整體落後。而産業界又以中小工業爲主。此種中小經營每易消滅於經濟風潮之中。而際此外貨傾銷之時會。國内各工業部門更應力求避免同業間之無理競爭。團結一致。以與外貨相周旋。</p>
<p>第三。借鏡他人。力圖改良。固無可非議。惟我國工廠每以傚法西洋各國爲榮。不知西洋各國之人力物力及歷史地理風俗人情等。均與我國相去甚遠。縱然學得皮相。亦無濟於大事。吾人所應注意者。則爲日本近四十年來之工業發逹情形。蓋日本中小工業迄今亦仍居重要地位。而人力物力等條件。又多與我國相近似也。</p>
<p>餘如市塲之開拓。宜先注全力於國内。製品質量之斟酌。宜多合於鄉村之需要。如都市農村能漸次回復於平衡發展之路。則國力自增民生自裕矣。</p>

<p>羅馬　此處政府方面今日發出佈告、稱歐洲各國所負美國之戰債今日又屆償付之期、但各國已紛紛向美國通牒、解釋所以未能償付之理由、該通告復謂、頃據美國參院調查委員會之所發現、美國軍火商人在歐戰時所供給歐洲之軍火、獲利極厚、計自百分之四十至百分之三百六十二、此種鉅大之盈利、卽自債欵之中得來、且美國政府對於戰事盈利徵稅極重、所獲甚豐、故在歐洲各國眼光中視之、所謂戰債問題之全部、已可卽此告一段落矣云云、（十五日國民電）</p>

<h3>改選後之美國政局（美國通信）</h3>
<p>羅斯福信譽愈高</p>
<p>共和黨聲望日下</p>
<p>美國於十一月六日改選、結果民主黨竟獲得空前所未有之大勝利、參院九十六席中占六十八席、已超過三分之二以上之最大多數、衆院四百三十五席中、民主黨亦由三零九席、一躍而爲三百十七席、共和黨則由一百十四席减至一百零二席、二者相形之下、共和黨確有每况愈下之感、次期總統競選、以此次選舉情形預卜之、殆覺無望矣、</p>
<p>自林肯總統以來、共和黨之金城湯池、如本薛維尼亞者、在此次改選中、參院議員及州長均爲民主黨獲得、羅斯福總統直不啻凱旋將軍也、羅氏之所以獲得如此成績、竟完全壓倒共和黨者、其原因約有以下三端、</p>
<p>（一）羅斯福氏匪特勤於政事、且竭盡心力爲美國經濟前途籌劃、一時雖未能克奏厥功、然以恐慌範圍過大、苟無如羅氏之努力者、美國經濟情形、眞不知伊於胡底、是以羅斯福氏深得人望、此其一、</p>
<p>（二）「新政策」爲繼復興法案而起之經濟政策、其着意於産業振興及失業救濟、較諸復興法爲尤力、除少數大資本家之外、多數民衆均表贊同、此其二、</p>
<p>（三）共和黨之所謂政策、對目前經濟頽敗狀况、並無積極辦法、而徒攻擊羅斯福政策、致更引起多數人之反感、羅氏因而更得實利、此其三、</p>
<p>以美國目前形勢而論、共和黨旣遭慘痛之失敗、民主黨扶搖直上、風靡全國、大有全國一黨之勢、且共和黨内部并不統一、新舊思想常生衝突、該黨政治方針、及内部組織、似有重新改組之必要、現在對下期總統選舉雖乏勝利之希望、然此次改選尙獲得一千二百萬選民之投票、前途不可謂爲絶無希望也、</p>
<p>至於美國今後經濟政治外交之動向何如、民主黨改選大勝以後、自將次第表現、在經濟上、羅氏積年餘克制金融恐慌之痛苦經騐、必更加實事求是、救濟當前之苦况、不過失業人數幾逾千萬、欲作有效之長期救濟、殊非容易、而左傾思想之潛行發展、亦以市面不佳而更見激烈、根本平定尤非易事、當改選未舉行之前、反對黨盡量非難、誠欲期選舉之勝利、使羅斯福氏完全屈服於大金融資金勢力之下、頃者情勢更易、反對派皆箝口默默、聽其施展鴻猷、而羅氏鑑於金融資本勢力未可輕侮、最近亦與銀行家實業界企圖接近、并不更變從來之調和方針、故股票市塲、商品市價、均現上昇之象、惟公債則甚衰疲、蓋恐膨脹政策擴大、貨幣價値愈低故也、</p>
<p>現時各方所注意者、厥爲外交問題、卽軍縮會議之主張究竟如何是也、自倫敦預備會開會後、美國政府殊無積極重大之表示、然世皆審知彼决不肯輕於放棄華盛頓海約之原則、而遷就日本所謂之事實、次則如歐洲戰債問題、拖延至今、旣不解决、主要國家又不付欵、致美國政府處於極困苦之境、美蘇債務糾葛亦停頓迄今、未嘗開始交涉、甚至一般認爲美國經濟前途最有厚望之互惠通商條約、亦停滯不動、故識者每謂爲美國執政者之淺見、</p>
<p>其實羅斯福固亦熟慮及此、其所以未嘗出諸積極行動者、蓋以每項國際關係條約之成立、皆須經參院三分之二以上之贊同、否則卽令與對手國締就條約、亦不能見諸實施也、前此民主黨在參院中僅有議員六十、難保提案之不被否决、是以隱忍持重、以視改選之結果、現旣實權在握、三分之二之贊同亦不成問題、則對西太平洋之外交丨丨軍縮會議之舊比率丨丨必更堅持、其餘諸國際懸案、亦將次第顯示其積極態度矣、（一九三四年十一月十八日於華盛頓）</p>
<h3>氓航空機匠張國家（猶哥斯拉夫國通訊）</h3>
<p>列山</p>
<p>具十年之修理飛機經騐</p>
<p>爲猶國航空專家所倚重</p>
<p>由于友人的介紹、認識了一位猶國空軍中隊長布耳戈士、當我抵猶京伯爾格拉特的第三天、他即通知我的朋友、約我渡河到他的空軍駐防地去拜訪他、可惜當天早晨、爲的我應了一個德國中學的邀約、作一次演講、遲到下午三時左右、方趕赴他的寓所、他是一個極懇摰的人、大家雖是初次見面、但却同老朋友一般、他告訴我、他們幾乎等了我一個早晨、原來他替我預備好一架飛機、打算親自駕馳、引我在猶京空中漫遊一次、後來從電話中、他知道我來不及趕到、方作爲罷論、</p>
<p>談話中、他對於中國過分的好感、幾乎引起我的難爲情、因爲在目前的中國、有那一點當眞値得人家的恭維呢、等到他把整個原因說明了以後、我才更瞭解他的誠意、他說、我對於貴國人的好感、并不是憑空來的、你有位同鄉、十幾年來好在我們部隊裏當修理機器的工匠、他的爲人誠實耐勞、十幾年來如一日、這種人在歐洲是不容易見到的、我們大家都十分喜歡他、</p>
<p>他的本領如何、我不覺脫口說出來、一面自已在希望、也許此次會發見一個了不得的人物出來、因爲我知道、當一個修理飛機工匠、不是一件十分容易的事情、</p>
<p>他的本領嗎、布耳戈士十分興奮了、他的本領是我們部隊裏頭一個、頭一個好手、凡是馬逹經他修理了以後、等到他說出「好了」這句話、那末你盡可放心、决不會出毛病的、布耳戈士指給我看、他的假脚、這、他在六年前有一次飛機出事後、右脚受傷割斷了的、他很感喟地說、那一次、凑巧你的同鄉被調到别部隊裏去、於是我才　下這塲大禍、假如他在的話、先生、我可以保險、我今天一定是雙脚完全的、</p>
<p>這樣一來、更引起我的好奇心、於是我便問起他的身世、怎樣他會說到猶國來、當個飛機工匠、據布爾戈士所述、這位張國家、是中國北方人、自幼在帝俄軍隊裏當個機器工人、自從俄國革命後、即跟俄飛行家拜逹克至英、以後又跟他至猶、拜逹克後來即改籍猶國、此刻他也是個中隊長、而且又算猶國最著名的飛行家、布耳戈士說、假如張君不是個最好的機器工人的話、那末拜逹克也不會到處帶着他跑的、并且、布耳戈士說、他才有科學家的精神、他是那麽樣喜歡機器、只要他有興趣的話、他可以整天工作過去、而不覺得辛苦、</p>
<p>我們一直暢談下去、我又知道張君已同一個俄國女人結了婚、對於這個婚姻、布耳戈士表示百分的满意、他說、你們中國人、確是個文化民族、這我由張君的婚姻中看出、張太太無論如何是找不到比張君再好的一個男人、我們歐洲人對於婚姻生活、眞不及你們中國人的尊重、</p>
<p>布耳戈士又說、前幾天、我告訴過張君、說有一位貴同鄉要到這里來、他很高興、他希望能够同你會面、</p>
<p>自然、我回答、我也正這樣想、他住在這里附近嗎、</p>
<p>布耳戈士呌他的衛兵去請張君來、十分鐘左右、張君就站在我們的面前了、他顯出是一位年紀四十上下、飽經風霜的中年人、我的第一句話、就問他、張先生、你還記得起中國話嗎、他笑着說、還記得一點點、不過長久没有說話的機會、幾乎通通忘記了、於是我就請布耳戈士原諒我們說中國話、我同張君一直談了半個小時、據他說、他原籍是河北人、十四歲時就隨親戚赴俄國、在俄國作過多年的修理機器的學徒、後轉赴英國、由英來猶、現在已整整的十三年了、他在國内尙有父母兄弟姊妹、惟此時存亡、却毫無消息、據張君說、他也曾滙欵回國過、因爲没有回信、所以他就未繼續再匯我問他是否想回國去、他說、想是時常想回去的、不過這筆費用太大、一時還積不了這許多錢、我問他對於修理飛機上的經騐如何、他說、差不多二十年來天天都在這上面作工、所以通通懂得、我說、假如國内有機會、可以得到一個位置的話、那末、你願意回去嗎、當然、這是他的回答、只要有機會、我是極願意回國的、於是他給了我他的通訊地址、這是我在猶國第一件、满意的收獲、</p>
<p>布耳戈士是猶國三大飛行家之一、他早年是陸軍軍官學校出身、後即加入空軍工作、直到今日、已有十一年以上的歷史、他不但是個良好的飛行家、而且更具有完備的航空學識、自從他那次失事了以後、痛心之餘、對於機械方面、愈加潛心研究、他與張君合作、便保障全隊飛行人員的安全、他的誇獎張君、自然是内行人說話、張君的値得我們注意的、也就在此、</p>
<p>「航空救國」在國内似乎已成個流行的名詞了、飛機購自外國、修理工匠來自外國、航空敎官是外國人、在這積無可奈何的現象中、而飛機失事的新聞、也不在少數、這裏、我們要明白、第一、訓練航空人材不是一件易事、其次、外國第一二流的飛行家、我們是請不到的、同樣的、一個良好的修理工匠、就讓我們多出重金招募、他國也不肯放過這種人材出境、因爲良好的工匠是空軍的柱石、他對於航空安全的保障、起碼在百分的八十以上、</p>
<p>編制空軍是一件多麽、艱難的工作歐洲各國都集中了全國人材於此、最少在十年以上的努力、才算得起一個航空人才、飛行家、不但懂得怎樣飛行、就算了事、還要有全部航空學識、連機器的構造與修理都包括在内、雖然、這還是不够的、例如、目前有一個問題、歷來戰鬥機是重於防禦的、轟炸機是重於攻擊的、可是最新的一種轟炸戰鬥機、却具有兩種技能、至此戰鬥機的作用將來就發生問題了、這種論爭、戰鬥機的價値到底如何、因如還没有實際的經騐、暫時各說各的道理、没有一個結論、但是一個完全的空軍人才、對於這個、他是不能够不懂得的、說到中國目前自然離此還遠、但我們却應放開脚步、追上去哩、</p>
<p>因之、我想起良材爲他人所用的張國家、照張君的才能配得起當一個目前航空處的總工頭、而讓一批高中工科畢業的學生去當他的學徒、這比花了一百倍的錢、去請十個外國工程師來都要强得多了、張君在猶國的月薪、比起他的同事門來要高出一倍以上、但布耳戈士還覺得那是不够的、他說、張君的薪水最少應該同我一樣多、那才合理、布耳戈士目前是空軍大尉、但因爲他的努力、兩個月内就可升爲空軍少佐、他的看重張君、使我十分感動、</p>
<p>我希望、不久張君就會有機會、偕同他的夫人乘輪回返祖國、（一九三四年十月七日於伯爾格拉特）</p>

<p>黨政機關均允設法</p>
<p>是日上午、本擬即行入城請願、旋以高資高郵·揚州·邵伯·仙女廟·等各縣代表、尙未齊集、故守至下午二時、全國各埠代表到齊後、始行同乘汽車入城首先向中央黨部·及五中全會·請願、當由倪委員接見、述明來京請願意義後、渠答允爲設法、遂辭出、續往國府行政院等處、國府由文官代表張耀德接見、行政院則由秘書狄膺接見、交通部方面、因正在遷移、故祇接收一呈文至於國府行政院之答復、極爲關懷、已允予設法並囑安心繼續營業、縱年底結束、但對於十餘萬失業員工生計當有妥當善後辦法、决不會强制執行、而不顧念到民生也、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第六回　貧女不能羞任敎不視西賓何足責空辱虚心</p>
<p>他原是帶有一些笑容的，到了這時，笑容慢慢的收起，皺了眉毛，苦着臉子，幾乎是要哭起來了。賈多才坐在床沿上，口　啣着烟捲，連連噴噴出幾口烟來。眼睛可是在那裏向月英週身上下打景着。月英不敢不讓他看，怕是把生意打斷了。可是一個十七八歲的姑娘，讓人家面對的這樣看着，也不有不難爲情。所以不敢全低頭，只好垂下了眼皮，不敢扳着臉子，出了神看着那床上的被枕。心裏也就想着，窮人是可憐。想害臊都不能隨便的。賈多才顚簸着兩腿，索興看了一個够，這就微笑道：照說這婚姻大事，不能含糊成就，總要問問他本人的意思怎樣？胡嫂子道：你放心，這件事不能有什麽差錯的，我就能够在這裏面作主。你想，假如他是不願意，能够兩回三回的，只管送給賈老爺來看嗎？你就看他現在一雙水汪汪的眼睛，都看在賈老爺床上。這句話，算是把月英提醒過來，立刻通紅着臉，齊到耳朶根下，向胡嫂子道：你瞎說！胡嫂子笑道：你看這孩子連大小都没有了，怎麽說我是瞎說！你剛才不是只管看了這床上的嗎？月英道：望是望着床上的。我是這樣的想，西安城裏，實在繁華，一家客店裏的床，都是這樣子的好。賈多才笑道：西安城裏繁華嗎？月英見他兩隻眼睛釘在自己臉上，又不免低了頭。胡嫂子道：賈老爺問你的話呢，你怎麽不答應。月英本來想着，這樣一低頭含混着也就過去了。不想胡嫂子這樣在旁邊催上了一句，不容不回答，便點點頭，鼻子裏嗡了一聲。（九一）</p>
<h3>初冬市街景</h3>
<p>— 荆溪</p>
<p>尖利的冷風飄過了初冬的街。</p>
<p>廉價的旗在空際戰顫着，平時覺得過於狹窄的人行道此刻變闊了，車輪輾轉的響聲過後，有着路畔小販之嘆息。</p>
<p>商店玻璃橱窗上，夥計把秋季大廉價的「秋」字換個「冬」字，無綫電收音機的嘴巴正向着街心，把電台上的不合時宜的小曲播入行人的耳朶，希望從而能够招徠幾個顧客。</p>
<p>過路人容或在精心佈置的貨橱前躊躇一會，但是他並没有踏進店舖的勇氣，辜負了店家把最低廉的價目標在貨品上的大字。</p>
<p>一折八扣的書籍散满在道旁，新書上也寫「廉價書」的字樣，但是終於也呌不回當日的市塲！</p>
<p>入夜，年紅的廣告映在光亮的柏油路上，寒風刺進賣笑女的華麗衣服的時候，貪玩的年輕人「床頭金盡」了，把剩餘的烟蒂深吸着，從寒戰的心裏滲出了一絲後悔來，但是已經遲了。</p>
<p>在天亮的時候，糞車夫把笨重的車子推過每一條衖堂，淸道夫盡職地把地上的黃葉掃着。</p>
<p>上海的繁榮呢？</p>
<p>上海的繁榮嗎？隨着秋風中的落著凋謝了。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （小庭）</p>
<p>社會好像中藥肆裏的橱子一樣，不論智愚優劣各色人等，都能容納在裏面，不過藥有生人殺人的分别，人也有好醜不齊智愚賢不肖的分晰。</p>
<p>舟行大海忽遇颶風，同舟的人都知生命危殆，惴惴不安，但是中國的國情，處在這風雨　搖的環境裏掙扎着，國内人民仍是恒歌酣舞，在愉快的圈子裏尋求快樂，人心不同，有如其面，這不知究竟是何居心。</p>
<h3>柴米夫妻</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>我有一位朋友，眞是一個奇人。他曾在大學裏受過二年敎育。他曾與十幾個女子同居過。但他却没有同任何一個女子結過婚。</p>
<p>他是在一個敎育會大學裏念書的。因爲同對過某女校的一位女生發生了變愛，給學校當局開除了，於是就在社會裏混，而同時，就與那女生開始着同居生活</p>
<p>他給學校開除了，同時又因婚姻問題，而給父母驅逐了，所以他對於家庭的觀念，很是淡薄。</p>
<p>同居了一年，他是失業了。那位女生，便和他發生了衝突，而下堂求去。</p>
<p>後來，他找到了職業了，又和一個女子同居着。但是不到二年，又因意見不合，而脫離了關係。但是不久，他又和别了個女子同居着了。</p>
<p>從此以後，每隔一年多些，至多也不上三年，他必與别一個女子同居。脫離的原因，總不外意見不合，或失業之後，生活無法維持的二個原因。</p>
<p>他在社會上混了二十年，共與十三位女子同居過。（一說十二位，因其中有二次同居的，是同一個女子。）曾生過三個孩子，都給生孩子的母親，帶了去了。</p>
<p>「你爲甚麽不正式的娶一個老婆，却老是這麽姘度過日呢？」某一次，一個朋友問他。</p>
<p>「夫妻的條件，本不過是柴米而已矣。雖然是正式夫妻，没柴没米時，難道就保得住不來這一手麽？」他說得很透澈。</p>
<p>從二個月之前起，他又失業了。失業了不到一個月，他的同居者，又與他脫離關係了。</p>

<h3>翻衣婦</h3>
<p>— 春雨樓主</p>
<p>時序的巨輪已推進了初冬的季節，一般有錢的人家，爲了未雨綢繆計，却在預備嚴冬應穿的寒衣了。</p>
<p>現代禦寒的衣服，比較大衆化的而又適體輕捷經濟的，那一定要算到絲綿了</p>
<p>在湖州城内，或是四鄉，穿絲綿的要算最普遍了。可是把絲綿翻入綿襖褲，或長袍内，必須由婦女承値這工作的。所以每歲的冬季，翻衣婦的工作也特别緊張，忙忙碌碌，差不多每天没有餘閒的。</p>
<p>蘇州，上海，我們時常會發現一張紅招貼，在門上或牆上的，招貼上寫着：「湖州婦人某某氏，代翻絲綿棉衣。」翻綿的手術，確有好歹，一樣的一襲絲綿長袍，手術精的翻衣婦，伊翻在袍子裏面的絲綿是很平刁的，穿過一冬，還是很好。手術笨拙的翻衣婦，伊所翻出來的長袍，穿不到一個月工夫，袍裏的綿却早已縮做一團糟了。</p>
<p>在湖州一帶，冬季内雇兩因上下手翻衣婦，每天的工資，大約每人三角。在上海，蘇州，翻一襲長袍，計工資約一元四角或兩元。所以每年的冬季湖州開往上海的小火輪，總是每天帶着十來個湖州婦人，到上海去充當翻衣婦。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>伊並不是跟那個說話，伊只是在自言自語；語畢，便又低下頭去，拈弄着那泥兎。泥兎依然是完整的，而伊的愛子却一些影踪也不見了！睹物傷情，這對於伊老人家的確是很難受的。我們瞧伊的臉色已變得非常的慘白，眼圈全紅了，但爲保住伊的尊嚴起見，伊仍竭力的忍耐着，不使伊的眼淚掛下來。這樣慘痛的神情，眞有些使人不忍卒視。因此我又聯想起了我在宮外所聽到的一段傳說，這一段傳說不僅祇是在人們的口頭上流傳着，竟有許多歷史家，著作家，也採錄起來，作爲信史的。丨他們說同治皇帝的死，是太后一種陰謀，伊爲着要親政起見，故不惜把伊的小兒子毒斃。丨這是多麽殘酷的謠傳啊！我想這些造謠的人如果能在這時候親自目擊太后見了同治的遺物後的哀痛，他們也必將深深地懊悔，不該發表那樣不負責任的談話了！尤其傷心的是外面雖有這麽一段傳說，而太后却始終不曾知道，連辯白的機會也没有。</p>
<p>在這些充满着哀思的宮院中，逗留了約莫有半天工夫，大家都感覺到厭倦了；而歷代帝皇的遺物，也全給我們看完了，於是仍由太后領導，列隊退出。其時太后並不曾把那同治所愛玩的泥兎放還到那玻璃盒中去，伊像拾到一件寳物似的很鄭重地親自捧着它走回去。往常伊是從不曾帶過什麽東西走路的，伊所需要的東西，全有人給伊代帶着，伊簡直是永遠空手的，這一次，伊竟會這樣鄭重地捧着一件玩具，益發可見伊老人家追念同治的深痛。（二○一）</p>
<p>科學趣談</p>
<h3>咖啡對於生殖機能之障碍</h3>
<p>— 希農</p>
<p>咖啡雖僅産於熱帶（如印度南洋羣島古巴等處）但行銷遍世界，爲歐美人士日常不可缺的飲料，猶如中國的茶一樣。在中國咖啡的歷史雖不久遠，但亦已普遍地爲都市中一般中上階級的人們所歡迎所愛戴，良以咖啡含有一種膺鹻質（咖啡精）對於神經有强大的興岔作用，故爲一般工作疲勞者及生活貧乏順要追求刺激者流行愛好，同時則以唯洋化乃摩登的定律的昭示，喜喝咖啡遂亦成爲摩登人物不可缺的條件。因此，咖啡乃形成都市生活中享受之一種。</p>
<p>關於咖啡對於人體的影響，以前有人惶慮常喝後足以引起神經及心臟衰弱，但這些在普通飲用的程度下似乎並不顯著，新近有一位德國大學敎授曾以家兎作實騐，看飼以咖啡後生理上發生什麽變化。結果，他發見了一椿出人意外而很有趣的事實，即家兎在以咖啡喂食相當時間後，旁的器官都無變化，生殖腺却首先顯出嚴重的病變，局時並證明此種中毒現象即爲咖啡中　鹻質的作用。</p>
<p>其實騐的情形約如下述：最初他僅以適度量的咖啡喂飼家兎，這時可以明顯地看出家兎是陷於强度興衰的狀態中，它儘不休止地跑來跑去，猶如起勁地在找尋什麽，又如人有懊惱的事情在無可發洩時而顯露的那種煩躁的神氣，隨後，因過度的疲勞，乃進於衰弱狀態而非常安靜地睡覺。丨在每日這樣飼食，每日這樣興奮後，以後便可以看出其興奮强度在逐漸减弱，終至不生興奮，它現在對於咖啡的作用是已變成了習慣。但，就在這時，其他身體的器官雖都與正常的狀態無異，而生殖腺却已顯示着病態的變異。此時倘令已中咖啡毒的雄兎與未食咖啡的雌兎交尾，所生幼兎數目雖與並通一樣，但其中一大部分俱在生後第一個星期内即告死亡。如咖啡的飼食。時間更久，則雖猶能交尾而已不能令雌者受孕。若將睪丸切成片子放在顯微鏡下觀察，則見精細胞在未成熟時即大量排出，同時睪丸細精管一部分已形萎縮。由此，可見中毒之深。在雌兎，則因中毒所受的損害更爲嚴重。因雌兎對於咖啡的作用比較敏感得多，在雄兎可以忍受的咖啡量，對於雌兎則往往已足致死。雌兎用咖啡飼養祇經一星期，便已有能受孕，同時卵巢的顯微鏡下的檢查，則見其中較大的將成熟的濾胞都已萎縮，因濾胞中的卵細胞業早經死亡。兩三星期後，連較小的已至剛成長的濾胞都形死滅。經五六星期後，不特一切濾胞都已消失，即中間組織亦已迅速地退化，此時各雌兎的卵巢其構造簡直與未發育的幼兎無異。</p>
<p>由於上述的實騐，已無可異議地證明咖啡（亦即咖啡精，因已提去膺鹻質的咖啡不生上述作用）是一種絶對的生殖腺毒，而且可以說毒性是非常地劇烈，現在此種動物實騐的結果雖不能即推論及人類亦必有同樣的情形，而且日常生活中似亦尙未找到顯著的實例，但普通人類對於咖啡精的作用較兎類爲敏感，由這一點，咖啡的愛好者，却不能不予以多大的注意！</p>

<h3>寃寃相報無已時法商掛起免戰牌</h3>
<p>昨與東華比賽無故罷</p>
<p>萬千球迷無不怏怏而歸</p>

<p>停賽經過　時指一時有半、球迷已踵接而至、忽來一西人、徑入球塲辦公室、自稱與法商有關係、謂今天法商不能出塲、因有别種事情、球員不齊云云、旋體恊會幹事周家騏君得此消息、即用電話詢問法商屬實斯時已開始售票、乃對衆說明今日無比賽之原因、宜告退票、一方面乃張貼佈告於東西兩入塲口、時觀者如潮湧至、均打回票、至於法商不到、是否作棄權論、猶有待於西聯足球會解决之、</p>
<p>寃寃相報　另據他方面探悉法商所以不出塲之原因、乃因宿寃關係、去年季中、在中華棒球塲東華與法商比賽時、至兩點半鐘、猶不見東華到塲、恊會當即以電話詢問東華、答言球員不齊、無人負責、有能到塲比賽云云、是以當日比賽無故作罷、宜告退票、事後西聯會竟不判東華棄權昨日仇人相見、法商乃亦演去年東華之故事、寃寃相報云云、</p>

<p>飯店當局、事前亦無周到之設備、明知往者必衆、即單以參加童軍之人數言、已逾數百、則飯廳方面、廳有充分之預備、昨日竟有坐候一小時餘之食客、尙未得食、此君帶有小童二人、不禁怒恨而呼、招待方面、更談不到、再該飯店經理王某之慢客、尤屬罕見、</p>

<h3>笑與哭</h3>
<p>— 煥明</p>
<p>或者在一般人的觀念裏，悲天的人大槪總是苦着臉的時候多；樂天的人，彷彿每天便非多笑笑不可。</p>
<p>其實也不一定。</p>
<p>世界上便有一種走路姿勢蹒蹒跚跚的民族，他們的臉成天都像很苦的樣子，事實上却很樂天：對歷史上的敎訓、他們毫不在乎。中國人呢，臉子上成天都聳動着笑，肩頭也難得穩靜，事實上却的確該悲觀一下了。</p>
<p>所以說：世界上的事往往不易從表皮上看出内層的眞相來的。</p>
<p>一個呌阿姆斯屈朗將軍的、（ＧeneralＡmstrong）終其身爲黑人服務、在他死後的日記上找到下列的一句話：</p>
<p>「我從不明白犧牲二個字是什麽意思！」</p>
<p>一個無色人種的人，能在黑人羣衆中以服務救人之心終其身、並且說出這樣偉大的話來，實在使人敬佩呢。他的犧特决不是以感情作用爲動機，而是理智的。正唯因爲理智，所以他能不要明白犧牲是什麽丨正唯能這樣他是更可佩了。ＬymanAbbott在一篇文章裏說到一個醫生：他不情願在倫敦掛牌，而情願到拉伯斯多去行醫，並不是那邊收入大些他才去的；他的去，是因爲那小地方收入太少，以至没有一個醫生願意去的緣故。</p>
<p>像上述的那些人，似乎都「漫不在乎」，也許人們要以爲他們是樂天；事實上，他們都是悲天的。他們悲天丨那是不要緊的：只要不因悲天而忘掉世界便好了。</p>
<p>在世界上，每一個有人的角落裏，人的表情往往都是表給旁人看的。在朗聲笑着的人羣中，正多着满肚子滬水的人，可是笑還是該隨時預備在唇角上，不然，三天没有笑，也許債權人便會疑心你將要破産了。自然，臉上快活，内心樂天的人也很多的。但凡這類人，我覺得他們都共有着一種不能創造世界的易满足的性格。他們朗聲的笑，往往不如悲天者的緘默：在他們的默默中，悲慘的世界却反而會逐步的淸朗起來。</p>
<p>爲什麽呢：丨悲天者的臉色容許眞的嚴肅些，但他們如果能在腦子裏存着世界，脊梁上負着世界，往往他們更能咬着嘴唇挨受苦痛。他們不會像樂天者似的隨時可以笑給人家看，隨時大哭，隨時可以破涕爲笑；一個悲天的人對人生的幸與不幸往往都不斤斤計較的：只是永遠不敢满足，因之創造了世界。</p>
<p>像隱士那樣緘默的，豈是悲天嗎？躱在書齋裏，喝喝茶，抽抽烟，竟或臉皮上眞的很少笑，但仔細體味他們的言行時，他們却該屬於樂天名下了。</p>
<p>所以有心挽救世界的，到是那些願意把世界切切實實坦坦白白切開來看的呢。</p>
<h3>隔世的犯人</h3>
<p>— 草明</p>
<p>七月的早晨，從半環抱着桂花村的小河上吹來的一陳凉風，輕輕撫摸着一切的生命丨丨有時，伏在每個呼呼地熟睡着的繅絲女工底耳邊，彷彿這樣低語着：「寳貝，起來吧，工廠汽笛在呌你哩。」</p>
<p>天剛剛睜開眼睛，旺財二姑丨丨那尖嘴的，四十多歲的婦人，已經從猪圈裏餵完猪出來了。好她放下糟桶走進房子來，拉開帳子，小心地問她底女兒：「眼睛還痛麽？多睡一會吧，反正你跑去，絲廠不一定開工；多做一兩天，不見得了錢就會够給你醫眼睛的······」那女人不聽見女兒答話，便自言自語地駡起來。「討厭極了，隔壁那賤丫頭，天天五更起哭一到天亮，比我們底小猪還不如！」隨後就點起線香，拿到門外，預備挿在「土地」神位前面。這時候，對門那矮鼻樑，大嘴的媛嬌嬸正向她打招呼。</p>
<p>「二妹底眼睛好了没有？」大嘴女人說。但聽了對方底回答後，就搖了搖頭，馬上掉轉話題，「奇怪得很，今早爲什麽總聽不見黃臉五嬸底嚮笛似的聲音呢？只是那小鬼頭底刺鼻的哭聲老在耳邊吵！唉，那賤骨頭賤肉···黃臉五嬸到現在還没有起來嗎！」媛嬌嬸說着，踱到她斜對面，旺財二姑緊隔壁那里，籬笆做圍牆的房子門外。「五嬸還不起來看看那小傢伙，到底是什麽一回事？」</p>
<p>没人回答。</p>
<p>媛嬌推開竹篾編織的單扇門，粗魯地伸脚進去，大聲講话。等到她看淸楚黃臉五伏在觀萻菩薩神　底下，而光着身的轉福，受了傷的螃蟹似地爬在她底身旁號哭着的時候，她便聰明地肅靜地靠牆站着，一聲不響。</p>
<p>一會，伏在地上的女人一堆垃圾似地爬起來了，望了望隣人一眼，擺擺手，然後檢起地上那把火箝，用紅紙包起來，仔細地放在香爐旁邊。</p>
<p>「好了好了」她提一個包袱似地抱起在地上滾着的，身體細小的轉福，使她平伏着爬在板床上，才回過身來，用兩手拉媛嬌，和什麽時候靜靜地溜了進來的旺財到床邊，指給她們看那小女孩屁股上兩塊母指般大小的紅色的烙印，並且用手指給塗上一些生油。她手指一觸着皮肉，那小女孩就用極度的尖銳聲呌出來：</p>
<p>「饒丨丨我呀，我以後，聽你底話了······」</p>
<p>「呸，不是已經饒了你底命麽？誰要你丨丨好好地睡吧！」黃臉五嬸拿了水烟袋，招呼兩個隣居的女人，一同走到門前那塊空泥地上去。</p>
<p>「到底是不是因爲她半夜又撒了泡尿？」尖嘴巴的旺財二姑老實地問。</p>
<p>「我也覺得奇怪，爲什麽今早哭得這樣利害」？跟所有的女工一樣，面孔蒼白的巧七姑剛剛抓着篷鬆的頭髮經過這兒，把脚步停下來，挿進這樣一句問話。「没工做的時候就偏偏起得早，唉，······五嬸，實在你到了這個田地，還要這小猪幹嗎呢？」</p>
<p>「不要？誰没有這樣想過呢！你們不知道當日她祖母那個可憐相！」她一面講話一面做手勢，那根紙條底火頭便跟住在空中劃了許多瞬息即滅的，不規則的紅色的弧綫。「回想起來，我還是年靑的時候，我們那塊桑地，曾經怎樣哄騙過我呀，最齷齪的糞料當黃金！不幸我自己連蛋也不生一隻，誰來承繼我們底基業？「養個開頭花呀，她會給你帶個小弟弟來的。」，有人這樣勸告我。不久，死鬼三姑便引了一個從白石來的粗眉粗眼的，五十多歲的老女人來見我了。丨」　　　「喂，什麽玩意呀，這是好玩的麽？」剛剛進屋裏去看過被燒過的女孩子的巧七皺着眉，用手掩住一邊面呌出來。</p>
<p>「那老女人幾乎把膝蓋跪下來，」黃臉五嬸頑固地翻一翻眼睛，没有回答她，却繼續着那個故事。「用非常急迫的口氣嚕嚕嗦嗦地對我說，「她是旺外姓，不旺祖家的，一生下來，父親就得了一塲大病算命先生便說她非馬上離開家裏不可。我想來想去，她一輩子生長在種田的人家，也一定不會有好處，現在是什麽世界呢？丨有桑地的，和開絲廠的人們底世界呀。像我老了，隨便等着我底時辰；可是，我們爲什麽不讓那條小命多得些希望？丨相信我吧，她是旺外姓的。」</p>
<p>「那可憐的老女人，没有等我决定，第二天就把嬰兒送來了。我没有怠慢一刻，馬上替她定了個吉利的名字。轉福那個轉字就是換了人家的意思。烟五丨丨唉，死鬼那時候還呌訓五哩，那時候還没有抽大烟，是一個非常勤懇的傢伙丨丨他很反對我的，說我無事生端。不過，我很相信自己的想法：一個人盡了他底力量丨丨要是他不貪婪的話，那麽他一定在生活裏找到满足的地方的。旺才二姑，你說是不是？」她把紙條弄熄，水烟袋放到地上去。</p>
<p>三十多歲的臉皮枯黃的女人，在非常興奮地講着，到半路增加了兩個在附近居住的女人之後，她就更加有逕，兩隻手掌在互相摩擦着，有時用力拍一下，像要使人特别留意似地。</p>
<p>「第一打破我底信念的，是訓五上了鴉片癮那件事。那條活屍，桑市還很旺的時候，他早已不高興到桑基去了！家裏有幾個人？事情自然通通放到我身上來······現在，我也不高興到那塊呌我不快活的地方去了；出賣，没人要，種蔬菜，自己吃不了那麽多丨丨」她換了一下位置，拍一拍那大嘴婦人底肩膊。</p>

<p>「從前，我像懂得生活的，我也懂得怎樣計謀才使日子打發得舒服一點。從糞料被鄉下人厭惡了那件事來，我就曉得世界變了，無論如何變了，變得怎樣使我不相信！</p>

<p>「我底大！難道她倒去相信這愚蠢的想法麽？那末，我們呢，我們磨折了一輩子，難道又是誰在給我們一種刑罰？」肝財二姑像聽得鬱悶了許久，一股偏促氣從肚子裏竄出來。旁邊站着的女人們，有幾個會地心點着頭。</p>
<h3>偉大的人性</h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>冉靑先生在他的「文藝雜筆」裏，告訴我們兩個故事：詩人亞歷山大。勃洛克，曾在一個凄哀的深夜，遇見一個街頭的妓女，他傾其身邊所有的給了她，自己却帶着沉重而陰鬱的心情，從她身旁離開。畫家梵·谷訶曾在雨雪紛飛中，救了一個飢餓的老婦人，自己却寗可挨着餓。</p>
<p>接着他便提出了他的疑問：勃洛克傾其所有了，但那妓女是否能因他這一點錢就自救而不再到街頭去賣笑呢？谷訶救了那老婦人了，但他如果遇到第二個第三個這樣可憐的婦人而身邊又不剩一錢的時候，他又有什麽力量去帮助她們呢？從這疑問上，他導引出他的結論：「可憐的藝人呵！你們應該往大處想丨」</p>
<p>「往大處想丨」這是不是對的呢？對的！我敢說，不但是藝人，簡直不論那一個人，只要他不是抱個人主義的，他的腦筋裏都應該存有一個全人類都能安居樂業的光明社會，並爲實現這光明社會而貢獻出全部的生命力。</p>
<p>然而，我們可能因爲「往大處想」，便說勃洛克和谷訶這舉動是無用是不對嗎？不能！我們與其說他們這舉動是無用不對，母寗說他們這舉動是非常偉大。他們並不因爲「往大處想」，便忽略了細小的。在人的立塲上說，他們是充分認識了人的使命，發揮了人的力量了。</p>
<p>我們試設想勃洛克和谷訶當時，假如抱着「安得廣厦千萬間」的觀念，認這是整個的社會問題，在整個社會没有改革成人人都能安居樂業以前，一切憐憫都毫無用處，而掉頭走開了，那他們的舉動，和尋常大腹賈有什麽分别。惟其他們能忘了自己的飢餓而去救他人，纔顯出他們的偉大。</p>
<p>卽以今年的旱災來說，災區蔓延逹十一省之廣，無衣無食流離瑣尾的災民不下幾十萬。如若人人都像再靑先生的論點一樣，「往大處想」而掉頭不顧，那麽在光明的社會還未出現於我們的眼前時，這幾十萬災民不是已都要餓死了嗎？</p>
<p>我們要有遠大的抱負，要把創造未來的光明社會引爲己責，但我們也不應忽略了這痛苦的現階段。</p>
<p>一個問題都有牠的兩面性和對立的統一性的，我希望再靑先生在勸「可憐的藝人」「往大處想」以前，最好自己也回過頭去，把他所忽略的細小處想一下。</p>
<h3>明天（十八）</h3>
<p>— （Joseph　Cornad）著吴向隅譯</p>
<p>她覺得她心中像不得不說一般。「那又是别一種的你們的心狠的歌呀。」她說。</p>
<p>「在墨西哥的桑諾拉地方學會的。」他從容地說。「這是嘉波先諾人的歌。你不曉得吧？這是好動的人的歌。没有什麽東西能夥束縛他留在一個地方丨即是一個女人也不能够如此。從前在産金地帶的邊境，你有時常可以遇着一二個人，從那兒向北去走過格拉河。我曾經看見過。一個在馬薩脫蘭的採金的工程師携帶着我和他一道去看守運貨車。無論如何一個水手的伶俐的伙計你總要帶着。這地方全是沙漠；地下的裂縫你不能見到底；和一些高山丨丨盡是大岩石，高聳在上面，條牆壁與敎堂的尖頂一般，只不過大上一百倍吧了。下面的谷是充满着水岩與黑石。没有一莖草可以看見；太陽在那地方晒得發紅色比我所見的任何地方都要紅些丨丨像血般紅與猛烈。這是好景緻呀。」</p>
<p>「你不願再到那地方去了麽？」他囁呶地說出。</p>
<p>他微笑了一下。「不，那是可詛咒的産金的地方。那地方有時也使我看上去發抖丨丨你要曉得，我們以前是有不少人在一起的；但嘉波先諾人却是單獨遊蕩的。他們在任何人還没有聽到那地方名字以前，就對於那地方很熟悉。他們有一種淘金的天才，淘金熱他們也有；可是看起來他的並不十分需要金子。他們要去找一處藏金很富的地方，然後就走開；也許只取了很少的金子丨丨只够飲宴一次丨丨於是再走開，尋找更多金子的地方。他們從來没有在那些有許多房屋的地方停了長久；他們没有老婆，没有孩子，没有家庭，從來也没有一個伙伴。你不能和一個嘉波先諾人做朋友：他們是太好動了丨丨今天在這兒，隨後又走開了，明天到什麽地方，只有天曉得。他們不告訴人家他們找着的鑛苗，從來也没有一個發財的嘉波先諾人。他們所注意的並不是金子；而是在多山的地方跑來跑去找金子這件事引起他們的注意與不能使他們休息：因此從來没有女人能和嘉波先諾人同住一星期以上。那就是這歌中所講起的。這首歌全是講一美麗的女郎竭力想保持一個嘉波先諾情人的愛，這樣他就會帶來很多的金子給她。不要怕！他走開了，她從此再也没有看見他過。」</p>
<p>「她後來怎樣呢？」她嘆出一口氣。</p>
<p>「這首歌没有講起。哭一會吧了，我敢說。他們就是這樣的人：接吻和走開。但那是在找一件東西丨一件有意義的東西∶∶∶∶∶∶∶∶∶有時我想我自己也是有些地方像嘉波先諾人的。」</p>
<p>「那末没有女人可以留住你麽？」她開始用一種粗沙的聲音說，講到快完的時候聲音突然發抖。</p>
<p>「不會到一星期之久，」他開頑笑地說，用那種輕快柔和笑的調子，激動她的心弦；「可是我却愛他們全體。對於一個好的女人的隨便什麽東西。她們使我落難她們也使我脫難！我一眼看見就愛她們。我已經戀愛你了，密斯丨貝珊是你的名字丨是麽？」</p>
<p>「她退回來一些，顫抖地笑着說：「你還没有看見我的面孔呢。」</p>

<h3>日本最近貿易之優勢</h3>
<p>— 畢森</p>
<p>日本貿易擴張，起始於一九三二年八月，成爲世界經濟的一個唖謎。其他國家，縱有恢復，但主要係在屬國内；而日本則大部份是集中於對外貿易。其他國家祇能恢復所失去國外市塲之一小部份，而日本整部貿易竟逹不景氣之前的水準。</p>
<p>日本貿易之擴張，雖然大部份是在棉紗·人造絲·羊毛綫等方面，但其他貨品之輸出亦有增加。在一九三一丨三三年之間，以日元計算，日本棉紗及棉織物輸出値，增加了一倍，人造絲及人造絲織物，增加了兩倍，羊毛綫及毛織品增加七倍以上，在同時内，日本瓷器，玻璃，燈，藥品，化學用品等輸出値，增加了一倍；罐頭食品，五金料，增加了兩倍，玩具，染料，車輛（自行車及零件）增加了兩倍，草辫增加了三倍。</p>
<p>日本貿易之擴張</p>
<p>日本本部六年來貿易之總的趨勢，可從第一表中表現出來。輸入輸出在一九三二及一九三三年都超過了一九三一年。但是一九三三年輸入輸出總額，依然在一九二四丨二九年水準之下。可是一九三三年輸出額較一九三二年超過百分之三十二，較一九三一年超過百分之六二·三○這非但微微超過一九二四年的輸出額（一·六○七·○三五），並且要逹到一九二四丨一九二九年間一般的水準。</p>
<p>自從一九二九年，日本貿易的平衡，發生一種顯著的變化。除開大戰的非常時期而外，輸入總是超過輸出，在一九二○與一九二八年之間，入超最高。自從一九二九年以來的五年内，入超總在一萬萬日元以下。一九三二及一九三三年入超的非常低少，表現一方面輸出增加，同時輸入相對的低微。</p>

<p>六年來日本輸出數値之變化，詳見第二表中。此種數字係指日本本部而言，朝鮮及台灣除外。</p>

<p>日本貿易啊顯著之現象，即輸出品之大量增加。一九三三年日本輸出量，較之一九二八年將近超過一百萬噸。貨量增加，如用指數表現，則爲一一二·七，而貨値（日元）指數僅九四·四。此表示日貨價格之跌落。可是日本輸出在貨量與貨値上，雖均有增加，但以美金表示，則一九三三年輸出已落至最低水準。</p>
<p>自從一九二九來，日本國際支付即發生一種最大的變化。一九二八年凈入超共逹一七三百萬日元，係以貸欵資本一一六·五百萬日元支付。此乃日本國際支付之經常辦法。日本建築工廠，均由國外貨欵。但在一九二九丨三一年期間，却發生一種相反之現象。自從一九二九年，貨物及金額之凈輸出，却出資本放欵來抵付。因此，日本從一資本輸入國家，變爲資本輸出的國家。</p>
<p>日貨輸出之地域分佈</p>
<p>除開生絲是大部份向美國輸出而外，日本大部份的輸出多係廉價的製造品。這種貨品的市塲是在殖民地或半殖民地國家。一九三二年日本貿易恢復，却具有一種新的現象，即迅速地在非洲·近東·拉丁美洲·低價市塲上發展。日本在一九二九年後在遠東市塲上，所喪失的，所了一九三三年將近恢復過來，而近東和拉丁美洲的市塲，竟超過一九二九年的紀錄。第三表表示日本在一九二八丨三三年間對亞洲國家貿易的變動情形。</p>

<p>根據第三表，日本在一九三三年貿易雖有一般的恢復，但對中國本部的貿易，較之一九二八年則降低了二○○百萬日元。其原因普通都認爲是抵貨運動，中國較高的關稅及中國國内工業發展所致。但是這種事實，還不足置信。自從一九三二年五月以來，抵貨運動即已消沉；而日貨所遇的高度關稅，遠過於中國，亦能克服；并且還能與英屬印度的紡織工業競爭。這好像是由於日貨大量的向中國偷運或轉口所致，故中國海關貿易册上，日本全部的輸出不能表現。無可疑議的，日本向中國的實際輸出，遠超過所紀錄之數字以上。自從一九三四年七月三日，中國政府實行减低中國關稅，使日本向中國輸出大大增加。</p>
<p>日本向東北及關東輸出，在一九三三年較之一九二八年，竟增加一○○百萬日元以上。英屬印度爲日本在亞洲的第二個最大市塲，日本向印度的輸出，一九三二丨丨一九三三年的數字約等一九二九年的高度。最顯著的進展是在荷屬東印度，一九三三年日本輸出量（日元），較一九二八丨丨二九年增加一倍。日本對菲列濱的貿易在一九二八丨丨三三年内，變化尙少，但在本年上半年却有大量的增加。</p>
<p>以日元計算，日本在一九三三年對亞洲國家的輸出，較一九二九年的高峯稍有增加。但是舊市塲之恢復，遠不及新市塲如非洲，近東，及拉丁，美洲之克服。一九三三年日本向非洲與海洋洲的輸出，較之一九二八丨丨二九年約增加一倍。</p>
<p>日本對外貿易之内容</p>
<p>日本大部份的對外貿易，是輕工業的産品，或如生絲這類的半製所品。最主要的是紗及織維品。目前這方面的發展是以人造絲及毛織品爲主，從一九三一年以來，日本人造絲及毛織品的輸出情形，可見第四表，這一類的輸出之增加，遠速於絲織品與棉織品。一九三三年的人造絲及毛織品輸出價値竟逹一○○百萬日元。日本人造絲及毛織品公司之利潤，與其向國外輸出量的增加，成正比例的發展。日本毛織業的利潤，在一九三二年爲百分之一二·二，至一九三三年下半年增至百分之一七·五。人造絲業在同時期内，由百分之一○·四，增至百分之二四·二。</p>

<p>日本棉布輸出之增加，分佈地域頗廣，可見第五表。增加最多的地方，是满洲，荷屬東印度，英屬印度（一九三二年），埃及，澳洲，及其他國家部份，這種擴張不斷地遭遇關稅的障壘，關稅牆壁能有成效的，似乎祇有英屬印度，土耳其，南非。雖然有種種障礙，日本棉布輸出，在一九三三年超過一九三二年，竟逹六○百萬方碼</p>
<p>一九三三年主要减縮的地方是在印度，日本棉布輸出，較之一九三二年約减少三分之一。在中國也大大减少，原因已經說過。但在满洲，關東的輸出增加，却因輸出中國本部與香港的减少而打消了。</p>
<p>這四處地方，在一九二九年，日本售賣六七一·三四六·○○○方碼棉布；在一九三三年，祇售賣三一九·八六九·○○○方碼。</p>

<p>英日的紡織業競爭</p>
<p>蘭開夏和印度的棉織業，因爲日本最近棉布輸出的激增，感受到重大的影響。一九三二年八月印度政府，就對抗這種威脅，所用的方法是增高關稅，並令英貨享受更大的優待。一九三三年又發生嚴重的爭論，在一九三四年初期，日印問題才告解决。</p>
<p>印日商約已經締結，至一九三七年三月三十一日满期。條約規定兩國爲特種互惠國家。但如在一九三三年十二月三十一日以後，日元對盧比滙兌率，發生變動，印度政府得向日貨徵收特種捐稅。如盧比價値跌至○·七三二日元以下，日本亦將有同樣辦法。除上述變動而外，印政府訂百分之五十爲日本棉貨之最高稅額。英貨稅産額爲百分之二五。</p>
<p>限額制規定從四月一日至三月三十一日，日本可售賣三二五百萬碼棉貨與印度，從正月一日至十二月三十一日復向印度購買一百萬包原棉。</p>
<p>此外尙有英日的競爭尙未解决。在不景氣之前，日本輸出在世界布市塲上，逐漸增加而英國則逐漸降低。自從一九二九年以後，這種趨勢更加劇烈，直至一九三三年日本輸出總額，竟超過英國。一九二七年英印紡織業之競變化，可見下表：</p>

<p>日本競爭之優勢</p>
<p>日本輸出業進展的兩個主要原因是：（一）成本低廉，（二）日元之極度貶價。精細考察之結果，可見幣價低落爲主要原因。</p>
<p>日本工業之成本低廉，是由於工資低少，與工作時間較長。在一九三一年日本工資雖遠低於英國工資，但以金價計算，相當於意大利及波蘭。但以後則逐年跌落。在一九三○年十月一日日本工廠工作時間平均是九·二八小時，每週工作五五至六○小時。</p>

<p>以上兩表可以確定的說明，自從一九三二年以來，日本輸出業的匯兌優勢。因爲幣價的跌落，在國内僅僅引致和緩的物價高漲，所以這種輸出的優勢，竟延長了好幾年。日本也如其他國家一樣，通貨膨脹的負但，全然轉嫁到工人階級的身上，工資减低，工作時間　長）見第七表）。日本貿易的擴張激起商業的活動，因爲雇工增加，增高雇工金額，但同時降低雇工的生活標準。</p>
<h3>白銀增稅的效力與洋拆高漲（續）</h3>
<p>— 張一凡</p>
<p>或者有人會說：今日米價已不能算低，在秋收中的農民，不能說無利。同時都市間的向内地輸銀，收貿農産物，這一方是調劑農村的資金，一方也是農村對都市在經濟上所應有的現象。這些確都是事實，我都承認。但我所着眼的地方，不在這裏，而在於今後的米價。都市間能改變其過去的投資於不生産的方面，而轉移其目光，開始去吸收農産物，使農民不受「穀賤傷農」之苦，這是値得感謝的。但假使今日新收的農産，都被商人與田主所在較高的市價下吸收了去到了明年靑黃不接，也正是農民準備大下資本，開始春作的時候，而米價在商人的居奇與壟斷之下，儘量地飛漲起來。那末今日的現象，豈不只是造成農民飲鴆止渴的行爲嗎！自然這是一個複雜的問題；但是要簡單，也並不眞的爲難。那只在於站在大衆的益利上，對今後的米價，作有效的統制，並對今日國内米穀的存量，加以嚴密的統制便是了。今日報上已喧傳近年日本米穀的歉收，開三十年來未有的紀錄。那末今日商人儘量地吸收米穀，而到了明日，即將此大批的白米，輸出國外去；那是一個應該加以特别注意的地方啊！</p>
<p>至於銀根涸竭，這是整個的金融問題之所在，增徵白銀出口稅與平衡稅的無濟於事，是與洋拆的高漲是另一個問題，但也是一個同樣重要的問題，而我想在這裏提出計論的。</p>
<p>前面已經說過：增紀白銀出口稅及平衡稅的目的有二。第一個是想防制白銀流出國外。第二個是想安定國内銀價與外匯。但事實所示。兩無满意的結果。</p>
<p>增稅以來，國内存銀之逃出數量，現雖無從推算，而且因旣用逃的方法，也就根本無法推算。不過據報上所傳，逃運出口的地點，是華北與華南。華北的存銀，先流出關外而再轉流輾溜到歐美。華南的存銀，則由香港裝運出發，而華北與華南所逃出的存銀，大部份倒由上海等地在内匯的名義上流去的，如上海先匯至厦門，再由厦門匯至香港，於是香港便登輪啟椗，渡洋而去了。這種主持逃運的人，當然不乏外商。但外商要裝現出口，似乎還不必如此迂道而去，儘可在不麻煩的手續之下，將銀裝進他們的鐵甲艦中，堂而皇之地施施然，出關而去。那末不懼麻煩，也不得不如此麻煩的人們，也許大多數是愛國的華商了。這樣，第一個目的似乎已幻滅了。無論今日盛倡努力緝私之議。但俗話說得好，只有「千年做賊，没有萬年防賊。」何况還有無從緝起之苦。所以單單想防止外流，那只是一種消極手段。眞想使國内存底增加，惟有靠國際借貸的改善。惟一句話說，唯有使我國的國際借貸，自逆差轉變爲順差，才是最根本的辦法，但要逹到這種目的，惟有平衡我國的對外貿易。這樣，識者所高唱的管理出入口貿易，倒是一個必要的手段。</p>
<p>至於欲安定國内銀價與外匯的目的，那末我們很容易提出事實來證明。假使你們無法否認數字便是絶對的眞實，那末下面所列舉的數字，便是這種眞實的表現，</p>

<p>先看上表裏，國外的銀價，在增稅之前的紐約銀價最高開五角五分六三美金，倫敦銀價曾開二十四個便士又八八。但是增稅所發生的影響，僅足有三個星期的成績。你看，在十一月十二日至十七日的一週間，兩地的銀價，不是又恢復到過去增稅之前的紀錄上去了嗎？而且像紐約，且有過之無不及，即使說，這是國外的銀價，我們的希望，是使國内的銀價，與國外的銀價不發生關係，換一句話說，要使我國内的銀價安定，那末且看標金市塲的變動，就可知，標金市價的升降，便是我們國内銀價的反映，那末，天曉得：標金市價，在增稅後一星期的最低價，與後二週的最高價相較，竟有一百十一元五角的差額。再以後二週的最高價與三週的最低價相較，則差四十七元，再與四週的最低價相差，又差五十四元，到了末一週的最低價，與前相較，又差六十二元。總而言之，增稅後的上海標金，確然大漲過一次。也就是上海的銀價，也曾下降過來，但以後却仍回金賤銀貴的原有趨勢。而且其間的奔動之劇，更非可以謂銀價安定之表徵。是則第二目的之成敗，也就可想而知。</p>
<p>或者您想說：我們所欲安定銀價之故，在於助外匯之安定。由上表所示，增稅後的外匯，顯然已入於安定之局。外匯平市的工作，不是已很有成績了嗎？但是如果您嚴格的研究一下，則外匯的漲風，豈不依然存在着嗎？而且在國外銀價如次高漲之中，我國外匯竟尙能略略主持其平衡之成績。則外匯平市委員會的一萬萬元基金中，現在已不知消耗了多數錢呢？如果以有限的資金，以應付無限的漲潮；前途之危險，是無以爲言的。</p>
<p>所以，我最後將說：我們如果足想從貨幣方面步列强之後塵，以遂行經濟加國家主義的政策，並不從一般的經濟上去用國家主義的手段去抗禦；那結果，是足有心勞日拙無濟於事的。要是想安定外匯，想阻銀外流，足有從平衡國際借貸上才有辦法。這樣，貿易市塲的開放策，是行不通的啊！今日開放政策的厲，我不是在本刋前期的我國内國市塲檢討一文中已說過了嗎？　一一·二一（完）</p>

<h3>湯山衛生設施實况（下）</h3>
<p>— 鄧立誠</p>
<p>「乙」疾病預防：</p>
<p>Ａ　抗瘧工作　該區瘧疾盛行，患者特多。據該所年來調查與治療之統計結果，瘧疾患者佔百分之五十，其中以十五歲以下之兒童爲最多。間日瘧佔多數，次爲惡性瘧與三日瘧。在民國二十一年秋，衛生署曾派員會同該所作大規模之抗瘧工作，及改良環境衛生一切設施。</p>
<p>Ｂ　種痘　在去年二月間，該所曾舉行種痘運動。此外每春秋兩季區内各學校兒童均舉行種痘一次。門診，巡廻醫療與家庭訪視亦增添種痘工作。</p>
<p>Ｃ　防疫注射　每年夏季舉行傷寒霍亂預防注射。是年春二月間，該鎭之石地村發生流行性腦膜炎一時感染者頗多，該所除另闢病室收容治療外，更巡廻調查及預防注射。不久卽告消滅，未及蔓延。</p>
<p>「丙」學校衛生：</p>
<p>該區有十六村，有學校四十餘所，計有學生一千餘人。衛生所成立之初，卽開始學校衛生工作。當時僅就湯山小學與仙澗橋小學兩校辦理，其後漸次遞增，至現在已有十四所學校辦理學校衛生，茲將各學校名稱列舉如下：</p>
<p>（一）湯山小學　湯山本鎭</p>
<p>（二）仙澗橋小學離湯山五里</p>
<p>（三）作廠小學　離湯山五里</p>
<p>（四）新村小學　離湯山十二里</p>
<p>（五）四莊小學　離湯山十二里</p>
<p>（六）侯家塘小學離湯山九里</p>
<p>（七）陳家莊小學離湯山十二里</p>
<p>（八）沿城小學　離湯山五里</p>
<p>（九）寺莊小學　離湯山二里</p>
<p>（十）西閊頭小學離湯山八里</p>
<p>（十一）上曹村小學離湯山五里</p>
<p>（十二）殷家邊小學離湯山五里</p>
<p>（十三）孟家塲小學離湯山十五里</p>
<p>（十四）上莊小學離湯山二十里</p>
<p>學校衛生工作，在每學期開學之始施行學生體格檢查，及其他防疫注射，種痘等每一學校設一衛生室，由公共衛生護士一人每日負責輪流至各校施行下列各項學校衛生工作：</p>
<p>（一）缺點矯正　經體格檢查後而發現之缺點，施行矯正。如沙眼，皮膚病等</p>
<p>（二）淸潔檢查　每一學校有衛生隊，由學生組織之而加以訓練。學生衛生隊負責學校及學生之淸潔檢查。每日施行一次，由辦理學校衛生護士指導監督，以養成兒童衛生習慣與衛生自治之精神。</p>
<p>（三）衛生演講　取材淺近，如衛生常識衛生故事等類，以灌輸兒童衛生知識</p>
<p>（四）家長談話會由學校當局與衛生所會同召集開學生長談話會。談話會之宗旨在灌輸衛生知識與學生家長，俾其對於兒童健康上有所注意。並赠送各項衛生用品，如手帕，牙刷等。由學生家長轉給與兒童。</p>
<p>「丁」婦嬰衛生：</p>
<p>該鎭向無新法接生，故婦女生産，均操之於穩婆之手。是以嬰兒死亡率特殊增高，産婦因産褥熱而危及生命者，亦數見不鮮。衛生所成立之初，對於婦嬰衛生頗重視，家庭訪視與助産工作，尤爲努力。鄙人亦曾隨該所助産士作家庭訪視多次，深覺我國衛生事業正在萌芽之今日，這種實地的鄉村婦嬰保健工作·頗爲重要，而該所助産士忠誠服務之精神，、尤殊不可多得。茲將其工作情形列下：</p>
<p>（一）産前檢查　鄉間婦女以爲懷孕而就醫檢查係一件羞恥的事，故門診産前檢查爲數甚少，多由助産士家庭訪視時施行之。然亦須善意勸解，始能逹到目的。此外對於姙娠中之衛生亦隨之予以指導。</p>
<p>（二）助産工作　該所爲普及新法接生减少嬰兒與産婦的死亡率起見，故不分晝夜，免費接生。並贈送嬰兒衣服，以資鼓勵。據該所統計自開辦迄今，共接生有百十餘次。</p>
<p>（三）訪視産後家庭　在産後之第二日，鄒作家庭訪視，爲嬰兒入浴及産婦處理等事。以後隔三，四月或一週訪視一次，指示産褥期中的衛生及嬰兒護理方法。</p>
<p>（四）學齡前兒童衛生</p>
<p>一·母親會兒童會　在每週星期六下午在衛生所陳列室，舉行母親會與兒童會，由公共衛生護士或助産士主持，目的在灌輸各種衛生知識與養成兒童衛生習慣。</p>
<p>二·兒童健康比賽　係六歲以下之兒童健康比賽擇成績優良，而獎以各項衛生用品，及兒童玩具。獎品價値自國幣一元至五，六元不等。兒童健康比賽會每半年舉行一次。目的在引起婦女對於兒童養育上之注意。</p>
<p>「戊」環境衛生</p>
<p>（一）飲水消毒　該區人民飲料水源，多取自於井，衛生所於修改及按時消毒原有之井外，並在離湯山鎭一里許之徐家邊村，建築消毒蓄水桶一隻，可容九百五十加嵛，利用池塘水爲水源，每日由衛生所派人前往抽水兩次，可供給該村二百人口一日之飲料。</p>
<p>（二）浴室改良　湯山地有溫泉頗適於入浴，故該鎭之浴室較之其他村鎭爲多。除幾家貴族化營業性質外，其餘之男女公共浴室，均不淸潔，且建築亦太簡陋，而不合乎衛生，衛生所乃於本年夏會同該鎭地方機關加以改良。内容換水，通氣，俱較以前爲週到。</p>
<p>（三）建築公共厠所　除改良原有厠所外，並在湯山汽車站對面，建築爪哇式男女公共厠所各一所。</p>
<p>（四）垃圾處置　鎭内由衛生安置垃圾箱多隻，收集鎭内商店以及居户垃圾，塡塞窪渠或焚化以處置之。此外菜塲之建築，私家糞便之處置，衛生所已會同地方機關，刻在進行中。</p>
<p>「己」衛生宣傳　衛生宣傳，爲推進衛生工作的初步驟，該所除陳列室衛生展覽，衛生掛圖及家庭訪視衛生談話外，並有門診候診衛生敎育及巡迴醫療衛生演講，兩者均在病人候診之時，灌輸淺近而易於履行的衛生知識與習慣，此外在衛生所之門前有衛生壁報，自湯山鎭至侯家塘沿途東有牆壁固定衛生標語。</p>
<p>「庚」生命統計　衛生所自成立之初卽辦理區内出生死亡統計，頗具成績，近復聯絡湯山鎭地方機關會同辦理之。</p>
<p>結論　湯山衛生事業，已有相當之歷史與成績，然而以幅員廣大，四萬萬人民之我國，整個民族之富强與健全以及社會之經濟與安寗，正在岌岌可危之時，醫藥衛生之設施，尤爲重要，希望我們醫藥界諸同仁有以促進之。</p>
<p>最後誠意感謝湯山衛生事務所主任何定堯醫師與其他各位同志熱心領導我到各處參觀，而得以完成此篇之調查。</p>

<h3>發熱普通治療法（十二）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>（一）　　　起初身體少覺不適時，一由醫師證明爲傷寒病就當立時臥牀靜養。大小便亦當在床上行。休息應當身心，卽身體臥床，心也要完全休息，因爲這是一種嚴重的疾病。</p>
<p>（二）飲食　相當飲食爲治療傷寒病第一要緊的，其餘任何種種治療均在其次。故對於病人的飲食應當大注意。對於飲食所當注意的有以下兩點：（一）須知道傷寒病人的小腸内有些小瘡。粗食物與不易消化的食物經過這些瘡處易使瘡破流血。血流的多極易發生性命危險。如果這些瘡被粗食物渣滓擦破穿洞更是九死一生。粗而多渣的食物如靑菜，水果全部，硬飯等均不可吃。所要吃的是，無渣滓，稀軟易消化的。（二）本篇已詳述病人所需的食物。發熱高時一個病人每日約需三千個加路里，卽一個病人每日所需的滋養料等於一個在田間工作的農夫。所以病人吃的多少也當等於一個出力的農夫。不過病人不能和常人吃一樣東西。病人除睡覺時候外每兩小時可進飲食一次，每次數種。下面爲食物的種類與每次多少表，照病人的狀况給他相當的飲食。</p>
<p>牛奶一杯　豆腐漿半碗　開水冲鷄蛋一個　米湯一碗加糖一匙　麵湯一碗加一糖匙　藕粉湯一碗加糖一匙　軟蒸鷄蛋一個　水果水，如橘子水，葡萄汁或果子露半杯白細麵包二塊　水果醬一大匙　爛煮山芋兩塊　牛奶乳酪脂各半一杯各種靑菜煮湯一碗　冰其漣一次兩大匙以上的各種食物可照病人的經濟狀况，身體大小，性别，年紀，分配得當爲治療傷寒病中最緊要的一部。</p>
<p>（三）治療高熱度　熱度在一百○三度以下的（百度表三十九度）可不必用退熱方法。在這個限度以上可用水療退熱法（各種方法詳前）。約而言之，熱度在一百○五度以下治法爲：（一）額上放冷濕布墊。（二）濕被單包身。（三）一日兩三次洗身。（四）病室新鮮空氣時時流通。如熱度在一百○五度或以上除用上法外再加上撒水退熱法，半身浴與全身浴（法詳前）。</p>
<p>（四）治腸出血患傷寒病的腸内瘡有時破爛出血。出血多則生命有立時的危險。大約十個患傷寒病的有一個人有腸出血。這種意外的危險治療得當危險可以减少，治療不得當危險加倍。腸出血大槪病狀如下：病人大便發黑色或有血塊，病人面驟發靑白色，四肢發冷，脈搏加快細而弱。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（二十八）實扶的里（俗稱白喉）（續）</p>
<p>（三）鼻腔實扶的里Ｎasendiphtherie</p>
<p>鼻腔實扶的里大都續發於咽頭實扶的里。原發性的鼻腔實扶的里。普通比較的稀少。本病也是多數侵犯小兒。就是乳兒。亦可發生。患鼻腔實扶的里的時候。大半先來鼻腔的閉塞。不久鼻腔的分泌物。漸次增加。分泌物的性狀。初爲漿液性。後卽變爲血樣的敗膿性。鼻孔的外口部和上口唇的皮膚。因爲常有分泌物的刺戟。所以常常發生潮紅。腫脹，糜爛。從發炎鼻粘膜脫離的壞疽性斷片。屢和鼻涕一同排出於外方。若用鼻鏡檢查鼻腔。則可得見鼻腔内充满灰白綠色的壞疽性組織。鼻腔實扶的里也是不可輕視的一種病。並且常能轉爲全身敗血症。或由衰脫而死亡。他的熱度雖然時常上昇至三十八度左右。但有時候竟可毫無體溫的增高。患兒除有鼻塞流涕之外。也並無何等顯著的痛苦現象。因此父母亦不十分介意。也未疑心是一種鼻腔實扶的里。直待經過日久。尙未見愈的時候。方才求治於醫師。我現在舉一個有這種情形的病例來證明一下。讀後或者也許增加些興趣啊。</p>
<p>病誌第九百八十五號（鼻部）診察日期二十三年十一月六日</p>
<p>姓名　程某　男　八歲　住本埠武定路武定坊</p>
<p>發病經過情形丨據云四日以來。鼻腔閉塞。而多鼻涕。且常出血。尤以右側鼻腔爲劇。右側面頰部曾經腫脹。現已稍退。並無寒熱。</p>
<p>診察所得丨左側鼻腔入口部稍有血性分泌物。右側鼻腔粘膜着明腫脹。充满灰白綠色壞疽性組織。不易剥離。强剥之。則易出血。鼻孔的外口部。略有糜爛。</p>
<p>顯微鏡檢查丨由右側鼻腔採取少許分泌物。轉送朱仰高醫師檢騐。結果查得實扶的里桿菌（報告單爲四三三七號）。</p>
<p>診斷結果丨確定爲鼻腔實扶的里。</p>
<p>治療經過情形丨立刻注射實扶的里血淸一萬單位。注射後第三日。充满右側鼻腔的灰白綠色壞疽性組織。業已自己剥離。故取出非常容易（爲長塊狀）。粘膜腫脹亦均退去。而鼻腔呼吸亦隨恢復。</p>
<h3>北平香山療養院之近訊</h3>
<p>— 郭美孫</p>
<p>緣起　西曆一九三三年，中國紅十字會北平女界分會，以我國患結核病者數倍於歐美各國，十九無相當治療，聽其自由淘汰，實非近代科學昌明中所當有之現像。北平近幾卽或有一二療養院之設立，然亦不勝「杯水車薪」之感。夫結核病，本爲能預防之症，病者如能早期就醫，有相當之看護及指導，幾全數能得康復。會中同人，有鑒於此，當卽着手將該會音山香山醫院舊址改組爲收容肺結核病者及訓練肺結核病特種護士之療養病院。是年九月，卽開始工作，收容病人，並開班訓練護士學生。</p>
<p>設備　當時以經濟人才，種種困難，加以女界病者療養處所之缺乏，故僅設有專收容女病人之病床二十個。不久以各界之要求，别闢男病室數間。最近又將院中房屋重行佈置·修改，目下設有頭二三等男女病床五十。日後如病室全數信满之後，再能擴充，以期有一二百至數百之床位。</p>
<p>院中設有化騐室一所，專作一切檢騐之用。此外尙有手術室，門診處，藥房等等。每日鄰近鄉民及香山慈幼院學生來院就醫者　衆。此亦向農村灌輸新醫學術惟一之步驟也。該院並自備電燈，電鈴。自來水，汽爐，西式恭桶等近代設備，使病者居住其間，籌鄉村諸事落伍之感。</p>
<p>醫師護士及職員　現在院中有二住院醫師，内中一位，爲北平恊和醫院畢業醫師。同時恊和醫院癆病科及外科專家，按時至院與該醫師等會同討論各種病案，醫治方針。對於須用外科治療之患者，亦能同時舉行手術，免病者進城就醫之往返勞頓。看護工作，則由畢業護士三人，看護生八人以及職工二十人分别担任。此外，院中並聘有職業指導員，專爲指導病人學習各種手工，藉以帮助患者消磨單調乏味之歲月。此及中國各處療養院所無，係該院之創舉。</p>
<p>環境　該院址爲昭廟古刹，宮殿起伏，亭閣參差，遊廊接列，如霽如虹，環道迴旋，如蛇如龍，虹松翠柏，古木參天，林壑幽邃，泉聲潺潺，空氣淸爽，氣候適宜，風景絶佳。居是院不但心曠神怡，而又適於肺癆之療養。且環山面水，冬暖夏凉，西視琉璃古塔，碧雲禪寺，光華耀目；東窺萬壽勝地，玉泉美景，絶妙絶佳；近視羣山，遠觀舊京，不異世外桃園也。</p>
<p>交通　交通方面，每日有公共汽車來回各四次，直逹該院山門。夏日遊客增多時，另外加開臨時車輛數次之多。香山郵局，電報收發局，亦在左近，收發電信，十分便利，該院同時裝有電話（香山十三號）以備不時與滬市互相通語傳逹之需。</p>
<p>入院手續　該院爲便利病者接洽計，特與北平東城，恊和醫院；西長安街大生醫院；孝順胡同婦嬰醫院，及府前街首善醫院等癆病科或「愛克司」光科，預先恊定，凡願入院者，可由該醫院等專家或西城石駙馬大街中國紅十字會北平女界分會直接介紹來院。北平市衛生局及恊和醫院病車並能代爲接送云。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（三十三）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第八章　臨床檢查法</p>
<p>（四）血液的檢查</p>
<p>關於肺結核症的血液檢查，是遠不及痰中结核菌的證明那樣大的診斷價値：所以一般醫者都看作不十分緊要，病人方面當然是更莫明其究竟了丨不錯，他的報告，是遠不及結核菌的證明帶專門性的；關於血液圖像方面所得；旣不像白血病一望卽可水落石出，事實上又没有幾種急性傳染病來得應用廣闊；這都足以使一般一易於疏忽的。但據最近研究的結果，這裏面紅血球和血色素的增减情形，確是没有什麽重大意義的；至於白血球方面類别的狀態，以及血液沈降速度的報告，都和本症的直正認識上不無關係，間接有助於診斷也是狠大的。此中的詳細情形，現在且一一的分述在下面：</p>
<p>肺結核症的患者很多是面色蒼白，構或尋常貧血症狀態的；這一句話，在前面第七章裏面已經提起過了！所以他的紅血球數目和血色素成份，大槪也是减少的。但這種變化並不是必然的；就是紅血球血血色素兩方，也並不是完全畫一共同進退的。有時血色素成份雖已减少，但紅血球數目並無變化，這樣情形，有許多擴大的本症就是如此的；尋常的貧血症也有這樣的傾向。反過來講，這種變化，並不一定在嚴重的本症發現；有時是齊巧在本症開始的時候已如此的。此外，還有一事應該提起的，就是：在本症發生出血和腸結核等合併症的時候，大半是發現强度貧血症的。這紅血球血色素方面的狀况，我們給他一個特殊名詞，呌做：紅色血液圖像；他對於本症的診斷上是没有多大的助力的。和他針鋒相對的，呌做：白色血液圖像；這就是下面所述的「白血球方面」之情形了。</p>
<p>關於白血球一方面的變化，在疾病診斷上有價値的，係分作兩方面的。第一是數目的增减，第二是種類增减的濫别。在常人的血液血裏面，白血球係分作多核性，大核性，嗜紅性，嗜鹽基性，和淋巴球五種的。其間每一種佔百分之幾的成份，都有大慨的統計的。關於第一種數目的增减，本症並没有顯著的變化，差不多和常人是一樣的。至種類增减的鑑别一方面，從前祇知道注意淋巴球成份的增减情形，這當然没有多大價値的。據最近息林氏的研究，對於上列的五種分類，認爲是不够的。他對於多核性一種，因其核形種種的不同；又分出髓細胞，稚幼的，桿狀的，核狀圓缺的，四種子類。這裏面髓細胞和稚幼的二種，在常人的血液中，大致是没有的。桿狀的一種數目，比較核狀圓缺的爲少，大慨係一比十五的光景。在尋常一有了傳染接觸，幼稚種類的數目大半會增多的。所以對於白血球種類的鑑别，也應該將此四種子類同時數計，方足以明其究竟的。關於這方面數計結果的情形，現在且單述和肺結核症診斷上有價値的兩種。第一種是多核性白血球增加，這裏面稚幼的和髓細胞兩種旣會發見，桿狀的一種也是增多的。此外則大核性白血球淋巴球减少，嗜紅性一種有時會缺乏的。第二種是多核性白血球增少（子類的數目也同時减少，）林巴球大核性兩種增加，嗜紅性數目如故的。在慢性傳染疾患的報告，大致是介於兩者之間的。單拿本症來說，他係以桿狀的增加，和琳巴球的减少，爲唯一之認識的。尋常惡性瘤腫的報告，子類數目增加大致彷彿，但淋巴球數目是增加的；梅毒症則淋巴球减少相同，但没有子類方面之顯著變化的。這種種鑑别狀况，似乎太嫌細微了，甚至許多醫者也很容易忽略的。其實對於診斷上的助力確是很大的；就是本病當時的症勢如何，有時也可藉以推知大槪的。</p>
<h3>瘧疾槪述</h3>
<p>— 王曉嵐</p>
<p>瘧疾簡史</p>
<p>古代歐西醫者，多謂瘧由氣候不良或泥沼汚水蒸發所致，故曰馬拉尼亞（Ｍalaria）或泥沼熱（Sumpffieber）馬拉尼亞係意大利語「惡空氣」之謂，一七五三年姚爾狄（Ｔorti）氏始引用之，一八二七年馬庫羅（Ｍacculloch）氏，戴入英國醫籍，遠溯往古，當西曆紀元前四九○至三七七年醫聖希坡卡特（Ｈippokrates）氏，已認瘧爲重要地方病，並别爲日發瘧間日瘧三日瘧三種，斯時意大利希臘及其他熱帶潮濕之地，久已盛行，迨十七世紀希登漢（Ｓydrnham)氏，始謂其基於一定之季節及氣候感作而發生。</p>
<p>一八八○年法醫拉韋蘭（Ｌaveran）氏於罹瘧者血球中，發見瘧原蟲，續經蔡爾尼（Ｃelli）馬笳法（Ｍarchiafava）諸氏研究，始確證其爲瘧疾病原體，一八八六年意醫高基（Ｃolgi)氏探究三日瘧原蟲之發育，闡明其新發育期與瘧之發作一致，一八九四年孟孫（Ｍanson）氏以絲蟲病傳染，由蚊媒介，請瘧蟲亦以蚊類爲宿主，一八九五年英醫羅司（Ｒonald　ross）氏證明蚊體感染瘧原蟲，謂瘧疾傳染，基於瘧蚊之刺螫，同年，意醫根拉錫（Ｇrossi）氏證明安那斐雷蚊（Ａnophels）爲人瘧之媒介，於是瘧疾之傳染徑路亦明。</p>
<p>一六三九年四班牙戴勤苛（Ｄelehinchon）伯爵夫人，在秘魯罹瘧，以雞納樹皮治愈，一八二○年派爾替（Ｐelletier）卡法脫（Cavertou）二氏析出其重要成分奎寗，（Ｃhinin）療瘧尤效，其後艾利（Ｅhrlich）氏用米替靈藍，氏原氏用新洒爾佛散，法製雞納斯多凡而所，瑞士製三○三，（peraerina）均有相當效力，一九二五年許萊門（Ｓchulemann）氏等，製撲瘧姆星，一九三○年蜜須（Ｍictzsch）氏等，製瘧滌平，治瘧更臻完備，自一八九九年柯赫（Ｋcoh）氏區别瘧蟲爲三種，並定防瘧方策，迨一九二八年國際聯盟衛生部公表防瘧方針，昔日僅視瘧疾爲醫學問題，現已由社會問題進爲國際問題矣。</p>
<p>我國典籍中瘧之記載</p>
<p>我國發現瘧疾甚早，搜神記載顓頊氏有子死爲瘧鬼，其說雖涉妄誕，可見有史以前，瘧已盛行，且素問論瘧最詳，說文以瘧痎痞三字别其症象，足徵古代患之者極爲普遍，當時科學尙未昌明，探討其病原，輒憑臆說，主氣候者，見易說，周禮天官疾醫，呂氏春秋月令篇，素問瘧論，主飲食者，見張機金匱要略，劉定素六書，朱震亨心法，主五行者，見趙獻可醫貫，主鬼神者，見左傳齊侯疥遂痁章及列異傳錄異傳甄異傳等書中關於瘧鬼之傳說，議論叢出，莫衷一是。</p>
<p>瘧之病原未定，故歷來醫籍，每就其症象而類别之。素問謂先寒後熱者爲寒瘧，先熱後寒者爲熱瘧，但熱不寒者爲癉瘧，巢氏病源有肝瘧，心瘧，脾瘧，肺瘧，腎瘧等五臟瘧之說，李臯十書有太陽瘧少陽瘧陽明瘧太陰瘧少陰瘧厥陰瘧等六經瘧之分。此外隨少數之私意而命名者，更有鬼瘧，牝瘧，濕瘧，瘴瘧，疫瘧，胃瘧，食瘧，癆瘧，如瘧，老瘧，母瘧，久瘧，痰瘧，痢後瘧，血瘧，胎瘧，夜瘧，厥瘧，風瘧，溫瘧，産後瘧，陰瘧等之稱，以現代目光視之，了無可取，惟金匱要略謂久滤能致瘧母，闡明脾腫與瘧之關係，研究頗爲深切。</p>
<p>至其療瘧之法，可綜别爲四種，（一）針灸，見素問刺瘧籍，（二）導引，見謝觀中醫辭典瘧註，（三）符咒，見張從政儒門事親咒果法，以上三法，古代人事簡樸，頗爲盛行，（四）藥治法，其對症施治者，如實症用柴胡，虚症用人參白术，有感冒症候者，用桂枝羗活，不出汗者，用麻黃，挾痰者，用貝母半夏，挾風者用首鳥葛根，暑濕内伏者，用靑蒿枳實之屬，類多無濟於病。其以常山草果信石等藥施之於未發前使之不發者，曰截瘧法，頗與科學治法近似，惜多數醫者奉氣候陰陽之脫爲圭臯，趨重對症施治，棄而不取，良可慨也。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>大同主義</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>今番榮獲諾貝爾和平獎金的國聯軍縮會議主席漢德森，誠不愧爲一位世界「和平之神」。此老近日在沃斯樂大學演講，題爲「世界普遍永久和平之基本條件」極力主張建立國際合衆國。氏首先說：倘自他一星球有外賓降落於此地球之上，彼將感覺極度之驚異。因地球上各國皆口頭頌贊和平，而事實上則積極備戰。一方面餓莩載道，而他處則米糧委諸溪壑。此種情狀之最足令人氣沮者，卽負責召集軍縮會議之諸國，今日猶復競相增加軍備是也。末謂，倘各國有組織世界經濟恊會之準備，則此種組織，亦卽建立國際合衆國之初步云。依此看來，漢氏不但是一個和平主義者，而且是一位大同主義者了。</p>
<p>世界大同，本爲人類最高的理想。但此種理想，離事實還很遠，並非短時日所能實現。蓋現今的世界，是一個弱肉强食，自私自利，矛盾百出的世界。在這樣一個世界裏，人類所表現出來的，便祇有殘殺，壓迫，欺侮，爭奪種種罪惡。這個世界，非但如漢氏所述，倘有外賓由他星球降落於此，將感覺極度的驚奇恐怕連我們一班住居在這世界圈内的人，也不免要對之表示希罕呢。</p>
<p>目下的世界，事實的確是這樣的：一方面有人在喊着和平，他方面却有人在呌着戰爭。一方面餓莩載道，他方面則糧食棄諸溪壑。這是何等樣的一種現象呵。這種現象一天没有消除，世界永遠也不會改變，而人類最高理想的大同主義，也永遠無從實現。</p>
<p>然而人類的思想，總是進步的。今日的世界，雖然是個黑暗的世界。可是這個黑暗的勢力，永遮不住人類追求光明的思想。故我們相信，世界大同，有一天是會實現的。</p>
<p>不過要實現大同思想，如漢氏所言，「倘各國有組織世界經濟恊會之準備，則此種組織，亦卽建立國際合衆國之初步。」此僅爲一種皮相的見解。必須人類能除去其自私心狹隘心，才有效果。否則一切形式上的組織，終難逹到其目的。</p>
<h3>冬至</h3>
<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>冬至在老了的楓葉中來了，可是在一百多家的五家鎭上也像老了的楓葉似的没有生氣。太陽是淡淡的，德祥雜貨店的金底黑字招牌在門口幌動，街上三四個怱怱的行人，一條黑狗死去了般的睡在階沿上的陽光裏。</p>
<p>德祥雜貨店的老闆，一個大胖子，面上多肉的皺紋，組織成永遠遺留着的笑容，有主顧上門，老是打着哈哈，那態度是挺和靄的；而且他更佔了這市口的重要地位，所以短短的幾年中，這家零沾洋汕，各種香烟的雜貨店，一躍而爲五家鎭上首屆一指的大南貨店了。門面也從人家半間的夾弄擴充到很像樣的一個舖面，櫃台是新裝的，朱漆紅色。早上，太陽光照見全舖面，路過的人都在他門前站立一會，老闆的笑容就隔着櫃台談些「閑野文」，如果是熟稔的老主顧，他授一枝老刀牌，倒一杯茶是常有的事。靠牆安置一個壁橱，有很多的抽屜，他把開洋和紅棗子分得十分淸楚，看他像隨手地包紥，却從來没有錯過一回，所以他講起宣統退位時的情形來往往忘了打烊的時候。可是那塊斑落的德祥雜貨店招牌他始終不肯更換新的，他說，「君子不忘其舊！」</p>
<p>現在這塊招牌又在幌動了，老闆翻了半天賬簿，才探出個大頭袋來，那笑容依舊遺留着，可是像霉雨時節的天空，令人覺得煩膩。他瞧見黑狗睡在階沿上，或者是他生平第一次的冒火，舉起一枝鷄毛帚來恨恨地在瘦削的狗腿上抽了二下。黑狗彷彿從睡夢中驚醒回來，汪汪的呌着，一邊踅着腿旋過頭來注視老闆的笑容，老闆的雞毛帚更高高的揚了揚，黑狗才莫明其妙地起了；在路角還回頭瞧了一眼。</p>
<p>老闆放了鷄毛帚，心中似乎輕鬆了許多，就雙手捧着腦袋，一雙細眼睛逼視每個過路的行人，他希望有個人上門來，就不買東西談談也是好；他有着满肚子的寃屈，要訴說一個淸楚，但是路人稀少，而且都是怱怱忙忙的。他像做着夢，翻起掛在壁上的日歷來，一邊屈着手指計算。</p>
<p>「晤，今天十八號，明天十九，後天···大後天，哼！不是冬至嗎？」</p>
<p>雖然是自語，却近乎駡人，聲音是宏大的；然而没有對手，老闆總是满肚子的寃屈，於是他想起了新裝門面的那一年丨（未完）</p>
<h3>回憶</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>假如回憶到過去許許多多舊事，莫</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>管是甜蜜也罷，悲哀也罷，一有了回憶的時候，終究是痛苦，可是越是怕，而它越是有意作梗似的越跟你親近，只要腦裏稍爲靜一靜，眼睛閉了一下，回憶便紛紛的湧集到你的身上來，而佔據你的整個的思念，於是每天差不多都沉在悵惘的回憶當中了。</p>
<p>人如能够忘懷於從前的一切經過是幸福的，不過能享受這種幸福的畢竟不多，人終歸是有情感的，同時是有思想作用的，過去的事，總嗜好打嘴唇上說說，或是回頭想一想，這樣一些懊惱和一些失意便隨着時時來糾纏了。其實過去的無論如何總無法追回來，已經就是已經，有時是會明明知道的，却仍要甘心將自己裝進一種無端的苦惱裏。如說自己前頭曾有一段輕輕的夢，夢一樣的美色的日子，或美色的戀情，然而這些已讓時間的足影所掩殁。什麽繡綉織成的夢都給現實的石塊敲碎，自己的身體亦被推進惡劣的境界中，一面咬着牙根和目前的慘酷的遭逢搏鬭，一面又時常追懷起往昔的塗金的日子，於是痛苦就更加增加了。從前爲什麽那樣，而現在爲什麽便這樣，如此一想，有時簡直會連做人的興緻都完全消失的。回憶除了只有使人灰心失望之外，其他没有一點好處的，如若以往是過着太優越的日子而如今則過着太凄凉的日子，那回憶不特將呌你挨着無邊的苦楚，或竟會呌你感到生之意味太淡薄了。不過倘說回憶在不同的情形上也能給予人以一種慰安，也是可能的，但這慰安可不是把先前所有的得意的事都拿來溫習，仔細尋味。其結果是只有痛苦，絶對談不到什麽慰安的；要有因回憶而引起一種慰安來，最好别想到那些得意的事，最好是得意的事能放開在一邊，另外去想到某些不如意的事，而同自己說着，從前的日子並不見得比現在怎樣舒適，也許現在的日子倒比從前舒適的，現在所磨折着的一點苦頭比起從前來簡直不算一回事，能這樣的加以解釋，就會得由回憶撈到了多多少少的慰安，然而這種人畢竟很少，時不時看見有一些人老除着臉，太息地道：自己以前怎樣怎樣，如今弄到這田地，想起來眞是不高興活下去，實在的，永遠是朝好的方面走，偶然碰到壞的，而又不能解脫自己，說不定會連做人都做不了的。因此欲减少各種無謂的煩惱，只有先把自己的情感解放，什麽事看得透，什麽事不當以爲那樣便永久那樣地不變，這是不可能的。如說現在過着满好的日子，但是這樣的日子不是能長長保持下去，在這時候，便該想到惡劣的日子會存一天降臨，而當那不好的日子眞的來到的時候，亦就安閒處之，一絲不以爲意。人間的苦樂是經常變遷的，每一個人不一定一輩子享樂，也不一定一輩子吃苦，有得樂享的時間自然幸運，但不必擔憂它的不久存，卽擔憂也是徒然的；同樣的吃苦的時間每每毌須呼天呌地，祇要眼睛放得大，如何的境况如何地應付，自己都有一番打算。至於回憶之於人，原本是大家共有的本能，但是想起從前的應該和現實的現在完全不同，不可抓在一塊作比。不然就惹煩惱，而這正是自討自的。</p>
<h3>方與圓</h3>
<p>— 小鶯</p>
<p>跳舞，好像一件時髦的事，於是，舞塲在不住的産生着。</p>
<p>不，不能這麽說，牠，不僅是時髦，而且還有着健身的意味的。假使在工作之餘，或者在晚餐之後，跳上那麽　下子，未嘗不可以其樂「融融」的，使整日的疲勞，都在革履與地板的交奏下滑出去。</p>
<p>但是，舞塲存在着一種迷，跳進去的人常常地能被「迷」失了方向，時間，團團地，轉不出來。</p>
<p>這，雖然對於遊客的精神和事業，都有相當的損害，然而那是可以不必去顧慮的。</p>
<p>本來，在那音樂的鏗鏘中，在那紅燈綠酒的掩映下，在那醉人的笑裏，誰肯顧慮到其他呢？</p>
<p>有許多人說：「生活，太無味了，太平凡了」。也有人說：「那，太機械化了，失掉了生之趣味。」於是，很灰心，很懊喪。</p>
<p>眞的，這似乎是一個難解的謎，當一個人由初生至孩提，進至成年而逹衰老，這當中的過程，雖說也有幾十年，然而，大槪是時間跑得太快了，只那麽一舜，就輕巧的溜過去。</p>
<p>在正溜踱的時候，情况的確有點太乏味，每天，起來，吃飯，睡覺，卽使在寫字間，那味道也够好過的，簽到，工作，散値，没有變化，不分冬夏，人，活像機器裏的輪轴在滾動着，滾勳着。</p>
<p>據說人之所以能成立，是應該接受這平凡的磨鍊的。</p>
<p>在機關裏作事，無味的應酬就比較着多。現在，是閙着不景氣的，應酬，頂好是現錢，給他景氣一下子，這樣，兩方都有便益的。</p>
<p>然而，每當挖現錢出腰包的時候，掂掂雪白的大洋，挺重，嚇，這是汗與力的代價呐丨不覺的，就要估計着時日，可不是麽，再有幾天又該發薪了，但是，不成，家裏還缺家用呐，没有辦法，從朋友處借吧。</p>
<p>薪水領下來了，看看封套上的數目，抽開裏面裝着的東西，得，除了扣付公份多少，飯資多少，捐率多少，以及××多少外，所剩的只這麽幾張褪了色的鈔票呵！</p>
<p>捏在手裏，怪高興的，又想：這是汗與力的代價呐。</p>
<h3>地理課</h3>
<h3>採茶婦</h3>
<p>— 野城</p>
<p>到了每年的春天，有許多茶葉商上建寗去開館，向武夷山及附近各地産茶區收買茶葉。等到春老時，茶葉買完了，收拾行裝歸去，每每太多帶着了點兒毛病回去。我們鄉人俗稱爲茶山客。</p>
<p>他們初到時，茶葉正在斷續的，從枝上採下，已採下烘好的很少，是一陳陳的採着烘着，然後戴到茶商的茶館去。山上的茶田，多是層層排列着，像梯子斜上去的，一格格的。綠葉满枝，史開站着的採茶婦，正在採下嫩葉。人剛好比茶樹高了個頭，黑髮白臉就像生自茶枝上，身上的衣服和茶葉色差不多時，更辨别不出了。採着茶，唱着山歌，閒談着，互相應和着，看去是多麽天眞，而在茶商們的面前，尤其多情了。</p>
<p>茶的出産是很豐富的，他們辛辛苦苦在山上弄好了茶田，再加上了多少工夫本錢，希望到了春天，天氣適當，盼到满枝恰恰不老不稚的綠葉，那麽一家衣食，就要繫在這東西上面，那呌她們怎不歡喜，而細心的採着她們的茶，對準着她們的顧主，想把茶賣得個精光，多賣點兒錢。所以當多少很内行的茶商或者茶館老闆少爺，有時到她們的茶田去親自看茶叢時，她們尤其像蝶在花間舞着，盡量賣弄風情，這種近於過度淫盪的情調，已經多年遺下來的，變甩習慣的風俗了。</p>
<p>有多少茶館他們買的茶葉，多半自己在館内開爐烘，雇了許多少婦揀茶烘茶，和許多少婦們挑茶葉到館内去賣，那更是老愛互相戲弄着，男女之間，雖是生客；但其親熱程度，是没有一個地方比得上她們的普遍和深厚；且視爲是一種十分普通的習俗。盡情的玩，絲毫没有勉强和羞恥之態。所以茶館内普遍的就是她們男女的聚歡處所；而最底細的一層性的關係，亦視爲平常的事，絲毫不足怪。</p>
<p>還有就是更足使人感到有點希罕的，她們這些採茶婦，是屬於良家婦女；那地方上家家有茶葉出産，所以差不多家家的婦女大都是這樣，和許多茶商以及茶商帶用的夥計們勾搭，這一種習俗，客人覺得奇怪，但他們自己却是若無其事的。</p>
<p>這所以成了習俗的原因，雖多少和經濟生活有點關係；但在我們這所謂「禮義之邦」的中國習俗裏面，就稍爲有點異樣了吧。</p>
<h3>夜</h3>
<p>— 埜</p>
<p>我酷愛夜，尤其是鄉村的夜。</p>
<p>當田塍上落下了暮色，天幕閃出星星的眼睛，或者一輪明月在樹梢窺探的時候，你就聽到四野裏迥蕩着村犬的長吠，和歸棚的耕牛的悲鳴。如果是夏天，螢光點點中有雜的蛙噪；如果在秋日，蕭蕭的風聲下秋蟲唱着繁歌。這些，都使感受到一種說不出的意境，好像是一縷輕淡的沁心的哀愁，使你低徊深思。</p>
<p>或者你在這時候漫步河濱，你可聽到水聲汨汨，和魚兒唼唼的聲息。偶而有一只小船划過，欸乃的聲音劃破了寗寂的四週，振蕩開去，餘音嫋嫋地，像一支無盡的歌曲。</p>
<p>夜的好處，只能體味，口筆的描述不能道其萬一，記起法國詩人謝凝野這樣歌詠着夜：</p>
<p>願祝你，美麗的夜，</p>
<p>使大地停息的明澈而淸幽的夜！</p>
<p>陰蔭的靜寂呵，</p>
<p>你只聽起我的詩音，</p>
<p>以及波濤拍岸的呼聲。</p>
<h3>流浪人之歌</h3>
<p>— 徐永泊</p>
<p>在一個初冬的淸朝，我冒着北國送來的陳陳的寒風，踏着泥塗上灘灘水潭裏的薄冰，掮着非常簡單的行囊，舉起勇敢的堅定的脚步，開始跨上了流浪的征途。</p>
<p>流浪的征途是修長的，走着走着，我已默默地起走了三年。在征途中我歌唱着：</p>
<p>故鄉所給予我的祇是一些悲慘的印象，疾病，死亡，無窮盡的煩愁，高速度的貧困丨我不能再逗留，我要離開，我要走：我要去那天涯海角，許多不知名的遼遠的地方，流浪，流浪，流浪，永永的流浪丨在流浪中成長！</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>在流浪中鍜鍊！</p>
<p>·····················</p>
<p>不錯，我已默默地走了三年了。成長嗎？鍜鍊嗎？也許身軀已高大了點，心腸已堅硬了點，然而引起我傷感的却不是那些，引起我傷感的是鬍鬚的加長，兩頰的蒼老，年華的一去不復回！</p>
<p>是的，流浪是失意人唯一的出路，可是這路也有個盡頭嗎？</p>
<p>盡頭是有的，但却還在遼遠的那方；要是我們有絶大的决心呢，那也總有走完的一天的。</p>
<p>請期待着我們流浪漢的建樹，流浪漢的創造！</p>

<h3>幾位電影巨頭口中的女演員的基本資格（上）</h3>
<p>— 仲嘉</p>
<p>凡是一個女子，看見了一位女明星，無論她是舞台上的，銀幕上的，或是無綫電台上的，聽見了她的洋溢乎宇宙的名氣，她的驚人的收入，她的奢華的飲食起居，差不多没有一個不對她羨慕的。美國學校裏的女學生，尤其對於電影女明星，有一種深切的羨。她們希望有一天，她們的名字亦令用電燈紥成了，輝映於大戲院的門首。電影旣已成爲藝術之一，那末做電影演員的，當然已經不是像舊日的排優，那樣爲人所輕視了。所以我們中國的靑年女子，現在雖然没有像美國女子那樣的電影熱，但是趨勢如此，將來的一般女學生們，亦許令像美國的女學生，那樣欣羨着要做電影明星的。因此，現在看到了美國電影雜誌中，所載的幾位電影巨頭所述的，女演員的基本資格，將它譯載出來，或者不是什麽多餘的事吧。</p>
<p>這裏所說的電影巨頭，是八個在電影界極有勢力的人。他們在已經曾造就過多少人材，所以他們口中所說的女演員的基本資格，一定是很有價値的談話。他們八個人，受到了同樣的問題，就是；「當一個女郎來求你給她些事做的時候，你眼光中所尋求的第一個重要資格是什麽？」第一個被問的，是一個歌舞片製作的巨頭歐爾卡羅（ＥarlCaroll）。他每年製造幾張偉大的歌舞片。他每年收羅着多少歌舞人才，美貌的女子。他說：「我第一個注重的資格是美麗。但是美麗有兩種，一種是面容美，一種是體格美。面容美在二者之中，或者佔着更重要的地位，因爲面容美，實在是比較的稀少些，所以亦更難尋求些。以上所說的，是對於選擇普通的歌舞女子而言的，要在選擇影片中重要角色的時候，那一定要用一種不同的度量了。譬如說，我們在尋求滑稽角色的時候，就不一定要求其美麗。祇要尤其能逗我們笑，我們就满足了，因爲我們看了好笑，觀衆們看了，亦一定覺得好笑的。再則當選擇全班歌舞女子的時候，我們還一定要揣測到觀衆們的嗜好，因爲他們的心理總是要求其十全十美的。因此，我們在每個人美之外，還要求其全體的融洽，那就是團體美。當然，每個舞女應當單獨具有的個人美，並没有忽視。」一個歌舞演員的應當具有美麗，是當然的了。但是除去美麗之外，還有什麽其他必具的條件呢？歐爾卡羅的答覆是：「當然美麗並不是可以單獨站立，而使它的所有者成爲一個女演員的。她一定還要有天資，個性，靑春，和普通的吸引力。」</p>
<p>第二個被問的，亦是一位歌舞界的巨頭，喬治懷德（ＧeorgeＷhite）。他接到了這個問題之後，他想了一想，但是他亦說，美麗是最先的一個條件。「那末你說的美麗，是面容上的美麗呢，還是體格上的美麗呢？」喬治懷德說：「兩種都是同樣的重要。」他又說：「我每次到要挑選歌舞女子的時候，來報名的，至少有好幾十。但是我所選用的，不過祇有五六十個人。她們的薪水，大槪是四十塊錢一星期。有的可以賺到五十塊，有的可以賺到一百塊，以至一百二十五塊，都看她們的本領如何而已。一個舞女工作的年限，並没有一定的。我每年排演新片子的時候，照例要挑選一班新的演員。凡是做歌舞演員的，她們稍稍成功之後，往往就被富家子弟吸收了去，或者自己不知保重自己的身體，以致隔了一二年，就不堪繼續僱用了。我們並没有定章，不許用舊有的女子，我們對於她們，並没有什麽歧視。但是不知怎樣，我們在每年挑選的時候，總是新人多過舊人好幾倍。」從以上的談話，我們可以看得出，一個歌舞演員工作的年齡，是極短促的，而短促的原因，大槪亦是她們自己造成的。照例的第二個問題是：除去了美麗之外，還有什麽其他必具的條件呢？」喬治懷德簡短的答覆是：一天資」。「那末除掉天資，還有什麽？」他說：「没有了。一個女子旣有美麗，復有天資，她已經具有成功的資格了。」　（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「桃李刦」丨金城</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>大家都懷着一夥熱烈的心，期待着電通公司這第一部作品。是的，這第一部作品的「桃李刦」並没有使我們失望，雖然經過一度改換，可是若干程度的仍然保持了原有的風格。</p>
<p>自然，當我們檢討這一作品的時候，仍得以現在正式開映的爲依據。</p>
<p>一點也不誇張的說，在中國這是第一部以有聲電影的手法創作的作品。雖然現在硬挿入不少字幕，但仍不淹没作品原有的形骸。作者從編劇到導演，他都是極小心的使用着有聲電影比較進步的技巧，在中國作爲第一次嘗試。從這裏正可看出中國有聲電影，從「脂粉市塲」「姊妹花」之後，這「桃李刧」確有其劃時代的意義存在。</p>
<p>在這裏緊抓住廣泛的知識份子失業問題作題材，在這失業恐慌的現在其深入社會的反應現實在作者的創作態度上，乃是最値得我們欣慰的了。學生們的踏出校門之後，他們的出路在那裏？這一個嚴肅的社會問題，在觀衆的印象中將必然的引起深切的考慮。特别是對於中學生或是大學生的觀衆，他們决不會忽視作者對於他們的生活之眞實的反應吧？僅就這一點，便决定了「桃李刦」存在的意義。</p>
<p>當我個人在試片時看到男主人公被執行槍斃的時候，那沈重的脚步聲和鐵練聲，那臨刑時的槍聲擊在老校長的心坎裏，使他爲之震驚，再聽見那最後的歌聲，和每一個觀衆所理解的一樣，現在社會上知識份子的靑年，乃是没有什麽生活保障的。</p>
<p>假使有人誤解着說，男主人公太不能忍耐了，那顯然是對於作者的侮辱。社會和學校完全不同，社會上的一切卑鄙陰險的表現，將必然的引起靑年們的正義感。作者在男主人公的口中大聲說「在不能再忍耐下去的時候是不能忍耐的。」相反的，女主人公是能忍耐的，她被人譏爲「花瓶」，她受盡了經理或同事們的侮辱，但是她到底打了經理的一個嘴巴，跑出了旅館。所以這决不是某人善於處世或善於待人接物與否所可解釋，作者在招聘一個職員而來了一大羣應徵者的塲面中，很明白的告訴我們這是整個的社會問題。</p>
<p>再說罷，作者處理男女主人公的個性，他是要靑年們無論如何是要生活下去的，卽使從公司職員降爲工人，總得有生活下去的勇氣。這也就說明了作者正視現實的勇氣。在這裏他盡情的描寫男女主人公的生活的困難和工作的勞苦。當他的小孩兒誕生的那天，工塲裏不給他請假一天。産後幾天，女主人公得拚命的勞作，結果是樓梯上跌下去。這種殘酷的描寫手法，在銀幕上是很有力的抓住觀衆之情感的了。至於最後的高湖，其緊張有力，自不待言。</p>
<p>然而，在這裏到底包涵了若干缺點，這不是說有些地方的聲音不够淸楚，作爲主要的缺憾，而是在描寫愉快與歡樂的塲合，調子太慢是有損害的。再加上現在的字幕，使作品失去了統一的作風，甚至於歪曲了主題。</p>
<p>有人很憂悒，認爲這裏從導演至演員，都是舞臺戲的搬演，所謂電影手法的舞臺戲，而且更危險的是恐怕將來和文明戲一樣成爲一種定型。關於這一點，我並不想將話劇和電影嚴格的分開，至少在舞臺上受過嚴格的基本訓練的演員，在銀幕仍極有利。不過因着時間與空間的不同，電影上更易於做到和眞實的一樣。因此我們决不能說從舞臺到銀幕是危險的，然而如要求演員全不過火，那要依賴導演之嚴密的把握了。</p>
<p>我相當满意的看到了這第一部用了有聲影片之技巧所製作的「桃李刦」，敢介紹於觀衆諸君們。</p>

<p>故事很簡單，寫一個天資頴慧丨得「父子會的作文首獎，頗能「鑑貌辨色」，而行爲正直丨爲羣兒所愛戴，俱樂部領袖等的孩童，因爲是由孤兒院抱來的養子，所以就被姨母及表兄弟所欺負，演成了家庭父子間的小糾紛，由小悲劇而到「父子團圓」。</p>
<p>在家庭以及父子的關係純粹建設與維繫在經濟關係上的現社會中，一個淪于孤兒院而又被弄進富家的所謂養子，爲了財産承繼，爲了社會，甚至於爲了個人的生存，遭受到親屬以及社會的種種壓迫，演成的悲劇，已經被寫成了許多有名的小說劇本了。可是這悲愴的故事，還依舊不斷地存在而發生着，這不能不歸咎于整個制度之不良的了。只有一個世界觀健全的作者才會正確地接獨到牠的本質，分析與指示出牠的病態的。</p>
<p>「頑童」的原著者喬治潘克非但未能做到這一點而只是無謂地作了一次說敎。譬如他的暗示做養父的不該聽别人的挑撥，做養子的不該性格暴强等。照他說好像假定裴克（養父）的接姨妹及姪子到家來住，或者畢爾養子）能忍氣呑聲的受辱，這悲劇就不會發生似的。這不是欺騙的說敎嗎？因此，這僅是騙取天眞的孩子們的熱淚而已。</p>
<p>這熱淚的騙取，不得不歸功導演愛德華克林。他把這簡單的故事，處理得很好。在結搆，發展，線索各方面，或者是神密的伏與露的，都很嚴密，順利，明快，淸晰與活潑自然。寫畢爾的天資與行爲，用釣魚，得獎，待友，以及做算術這些來自然地托出。用姨母和他按吻留下個脂痕來寫出姨母的習性與他此後將遭受的羞辱。用兩隻狗相過的怒視來啟示雙方的糾紛。幾次用畢爾和狗的關係來增加感情的成份，幾次用男女僕人對姨母的態度來對比那父母的失察等。餘如空氣的把握與調子的對比等，都增加了不少戲劇的，感情的力量。至于待秘密一半揭穿時，形成高潮後的許多戲，由幼童明星賈克柯柏做得固然深刻與充份，騙取眼淚的地方，簡直使人不敢相信這麽小的孩子竟如此會做戲。以作者的主觀硬注入孩子身上，使他成人化地來代自己說敎，固然是作者用心所在的地方，可是由於不眞實的感想與事實，會被否認了他的用心，想也是作者所未料及的吧。自然我們不能把這個歸咎於導演似乎是應該由編劇負責的。</p>
<p>演員以飾父親的有爐火純靑之妙，與童星賈克柯柏是成功地配合着的。</p>

<h3>金蓮刧（Have　a　Heart）（二）</h3>
<p>— 叔敏</p>
<p>自從那天晚上出事之後，莎麗在醫院裏一住，忽忽已是兩個多月。這個時候莎麗的心卜卜跳着，靜待着醫生的判定。多多少少次，她總是安慰着她自己，自己告訴自己，她一定可以行走如常的，上天一定不至於剥奪她自由的快樂的。但是史畢爾醫生慢慢地從匣子裏取出一隻厚底的鞋，交給了她，莎麗接過了那隻鞋，看着呆了。他的心也不跳勳了，週身的血好似凝住了。原來那只鞋的底，足足有二寸多厚。她肚子裏這才明白她那隻脚受傷的程度。她心裏雖然難受，但是她却假意的，看着自己脚上還穿着的白緞子的鞋笑道：「這多難看，比我脚上的差得多了。」史畢爾醫生伸出手來，和她拉着，安慰着她，並且告訴她，這是他們至多能做到這樣。此外還有一兩位骨科專家，或者本事比他們還要大些。但是他們都在歐洲，其中有一位裴倫資醫生，尤其有名，他是常住在維也納的。史畢爾醫生講完了，慢慢將她脚上白緞子的鞋，脫了下來，替她換上了那只厚底的鞋。他並且很小心地替她縛好了鞋帶，然後將一條絨毯，替她蓋住了脚。正在這個當兒，佐易走了進來。史畢爾醫生就站住了，和他說了幾句話，極力稱讚莎麗的勇敢。等到他說完了，就走了。</p>
<p>史畢爾醫生走了之後，佐易突然回過頭來，對着莎麗道：「你能照常走路不能呢？」莎麗且不回答他的話，祇慢慢地將那條毯子拉了開來，露出了那只極可怕的，穿着厚底鞋的脚。佐易一看，不覺嚇了一跳。他喊道：「怎麽？你一定要穿了那種東西，才能走路嗎？」他的驚懼和厭惡，是很顯而易見的。瓊看了佐易那付神氣，就生氣似的譏笑他道：「她的脚縮短了一截，你的脚呢？難道你亦要縮脚了嗎？」佐易聽了，亦很生氣的對着瓊道：「怎麽啦？我並没有提到什麽話吓。我並没有說起結婚不結婚的事吓。這還有什麽可說的呢？我是情願做事做到底的。」佐易嘴裏雖這樣說，可是莎麗早就看出了他的眞心。她看見了他臉上那副害怕的神氣，以及他連聲的辯白，說他願意和她結婚，她早已明白了他們的愛情，已是無可救藥的了。她願意和他解除婚約，可是佐易還是繼續假意爭辯着。莎麗再也受不住了，她就呌佐易去吧。佐易得了一聲命令呌他走，也就樂得走開了。</p>
<p>等到佐易走了之後，莎麗看着瓊，她勉强地笑了一笑。她說她從今做洋囡囡的。她以後可以做些洋囡囡。無論如何，她必須繼續着維持生活。她說：「做洋囡囡是很有趣的。我們以後還是很快活的，一塊兒同住着。」她說的時候，她私心竊喜她的聲音竟没有發抖。可是瓊已經忍不住了，她的眼淚漱漱地落了下來，她連忙别過頭去，不讓莎麗看見。然後她走出去收拾莎麗的東西，好和她一同出醫院回家去。屋子裏祇剩了莎麗一個人。她看着她那隻笨重的脚，又看着桌子上放着的，那隻小巧玲瓏的縀鞋。她勉强下來，想走幾步試試。很悲慟地她知道她的脚，已經是跛的了。她的眼淚禁不住從眼睛裏，泉水似的湧了出來。她不覺倒在籐沙發裏，兩隻手捧着臉很悲切地哭了起來。（未完）</p>

<h3>A Certain Prominent Figure in Financial Circles Discusses the Issue of Silver Exports</h3>
<p>Ingenious Methods of Smuggling Abound</p>
<p>Authorities Discern the Harm and Effectively Curb It</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain prominent figure in financial circles said, "Most of our country's silver reserves are concentrated in Shanghai. At one point last year, they exceeded 800 million. Domestic bank deposits accounted for slightly less than two-thirds, while foreign banks held slightly more than two-thirds. Starting in June of this year, affected by the US expansionist policies, foreign silver prices gradually rose, the US dollar greatly contracted, and the British pound remained unchanged. Chinese and foreign speculators, seeing the possibility of profiting by transferring silver, used substantial capital to absorb silver from the market for transport and to export silver from reserves. As of now, the exact amount that has flowed out is impossible to ascertain without an investigation. What is known is that Chinese commercial banks hold approximately 250 to 800 million, while foreign banks hold less than that. The outflow from foreign banks is more than one-third greater than that from Chinese commercial banks. Shanghai's interbank lending rates have been affected by this, soaring to over 20%, although they were fluctuating a month ago. Although this is related to the end of the year, such a situation has never occurred in the past, indicating that the impact has not yet subsided. Since the Ministry of Finance issued silver export taxes and equalization duties, the official export of silver through customs seems to have decreased on the surface. However, in the past two or three weeks, it has not actually decreased. Their methods of smuggling are extremely ingenious, utilizing transit methods on the one hand and smuggling on the other. In the north, Tianjin is used as a base, and in the south, Xiamen is used as a base, to carry out their secret transport plans. Some even use the convenience of exchanging Central Bank notes everywhere as a medium for exporting silver. They collect tens or hundreds of thousands of yuan in Central Bank notes in Shanghai, take them to Beiping and Tianjin for exchange, and then transport them out of the Great Wall passes, transferring them to Dalian or other ports for export. Later, when the Central Bank discovered this abuse, it changed to exchanging with checks. For large sums of money, only banks or silver shops can hold checks to transfer money to Shanghai. The local authorities do not exchange cash. Although this ingenious method has been discovered, they still use the Great Wall as a base for exports. Recently, all ports in North China simultaneously banned the carrying of excessive cash, confiscating anything over the limit. The local government and customs are jointly managing this and have achieved considerable results, but complete eradication is still impossible. Regarding the issue of rescuing the outflow of silver, there was once a rumor that silver would be nationalized, but the Ministry of Finance has denied this, so it is not true. Reliable sources say that the Ministry of Finance believes that the current outflow of silver is not excessive and that there is no need to take further measures. If the trend of smuggling does not stop, the Ministry of Finance can use the flexibility of the equalization duty to urgently stop it. For example, if the price of silver in London rises by one penny, the equalization duty can also be raised by one penny, making it unprofitable after deducting exchange rates and transportation costs, and even buying exchange bills would be impossible. Conversely, if the price of silver in London continues to fall, the equalization duty can also be lowered to a level suitable for the lower price. Since President Roosevelt implemented expansionary monetary policies in the United States to promote domestic production, starting in the current fiscal year (June), it has been absorbing silver as much as possible, and this policy remains unchanged. In addition to concentrating silver from the American silver zone, it also focuses on silver from the East, such as China and India. It is impossible to know whether this expansionary policy is solely for the purpose of reviving industry or whether it contains the intention of an international currency war. In September, our country protested to the US State Department, but the White House only acknowledged considering policies that would not harm China's monetary policy. Subsequently, Ambassador Shih Chao-chi also had several conversations with US Secretary of State Hull, but the true attitude remains unclear. Therefore, the issue of silver exports has actually become involved in an international currency war and should not be seen as purely a profit-making activity. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Naming Ceremony Held in Nanjing for Nine Aircraft</h3>
<p>Donated by Employees of Various Railways and Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Wang Zhi-xun Delivers Speech and Issues Award Certificates</p>
<p>Performances of Aerobatics by Each Aircraft Were Quite Astonishing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A naming ceremony for nine aircraft donated by various railways and overseas Chinese in Java was held at the Ming Palace airfield at 9:00 AM on the 16th. In advance, each of the nine aircraft was covered with the Party and National flags. Along with aircraft awaiting participation in flight demonstrations, three aircraft were arranged in a line in front of the ceremonial platform in the north of the airfield. On the platform, the Party and National flags and the portrait of the Premier were hung high. The surrounding area was heavily guarded by military police. Around 8:00 AM, President Wang, along with Zeng Zhong-ming, Chen Shu-ren, Zhang Dao-fan, Shao Yuan-chong, Chen Qing-yun, Tan Zhen, Xiao Ji-shan, Lü Chao, Zhang Ji, and over a dozen representatives from Party, government, and military agencies, arrived together to observe. A tidal wave of people surged into the airfield, reaching a total of 20,000 people. The meeting began at 9:00 AM, with Chairman Wang delivering an opening speech, discussing national salvation through aviation and its importance in today's world, and awarding the aircraft donors. Zeng Zhong-ming and Chen Shu-ren, representing the Railway Department and overseas Chinese, reported on the donation of funds. Central Representative Zhang Dao-fan, National Government Representative Lü Chao, and Military Affairs Commission Representative Chen Qing-yun delivered speeches one after another. In addition to expressing gratitude to the patriotic overseas Chinese and railway employees, they stated that the nation's citizens have recognized the significance and hope of national salvation through aviation since the September 18th Incident. People have enthusiastically donated funds and purchased aviation lottery tickets, fulfilling their patriotic duty. The government should work together with the people to develop the aviation industry and strengthen the nation's strength. Then the naming ceremony was held. Representatives from Jinpu, Zhengda, Longhai, Jinghu-Huhangyong, Beining, Jiaoji, Ping-Sui, Railway No. 1 and No. 2 each read out their aircraft dedication letters. After reading, they handed them to Wang for acceptance, and Wang read out the award certificates. Amidst the melodious sound of military music, certificates and gold and silver medals were awarded, totaling eight. Then the representatives of the Java overseas Chinese read out their aircraft dedication letter, which was also accepted by Wang, who issued award certificates and medals. Following this, a unveiling ceremony was held. Wang and dozens of representatives from the Central Government, the National Government, the Military Affairs Commission, various railways, and overseas Chinese went from the platform to each aircraft to unveil the Party and National flags naming each aircraft. After the ceremony, the flight demonstration began. The eight aircraft named Railway No. and the Java aircraft, led by the aviation team leader Xing Chan-fei, took off in batches. Assembling in the sky, they formed various shapes such as echelon formations, forward formations, and column formations, soaring in the air for half an hour before descending. Finally, Gao Zhi-hang, Zhou Ting-fang, and Liu Cui-gang flew Pinghan No. 1 and 2 and Jinghu-Huhangyong aircraft, performing aerobatics such as inverted flight, turns, ascents, and descents. The spectators at the flight demonstration were all amazed. Wang and other dignitaries also applauded and praised continuously. The performance ended at 11:00 AM, and the crowd dispersed. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In his speech at the naming ceremony for the nine aircraft today, President Wang said, in summary: "Looking at the rapid development of aviation worldwide, it is used as a powerful tool in both transportation and national defense. The strength of countries in the world today is mostly measured by the number of aircraft they possess. China's territory is vast, but the number of aircraft is small, almost non-existent. To build a strong air defense and air force, let's look at France and Russia. France has announced that it has 3,000 aircraft, and Russia has announced about 3,000 to 4,000. I think the number must be higher than that. Therefore, our air force must be expanded. The nation's citizens already have a deep understanding of aviation saving the nation. Railway employees and overseas Chinese in Java have specifically saved money from their expenses and donated funds to build aircraft, which is sufficient to aid the development of the government's air power and further arouse the nation's attention. I hope that in the future, the slogan 'aviation saving the nation' will spread throughout the country and overseas." (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Completion of Japanese Airfield Construction at Balitai</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Claims It is a Sports Field</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the airfield built by the Japanese at Balitai, south of Tianjin, the Tianjin Municipal Government sent consultant Sun Run-yu to negotiate with the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Kawagoe Shigeru. The Japanese side flatly denied that the building was an airfield, claiming it was only being built as a baseball field. However, its construction is by no means a sports field. From the Japanese Concession's Haiguang Temple barracks, passing through Nanguan and all the way to Balitai, along the new road built by the Japanese, electric poles and telephone poles are buried on both sides. On the 16th, in order to show that the building did not belong to the airfield, the Japanese side specially held the opening ceremony of the sports field. Consul Kawagoe, Commander Umezu, Chief of Staff Sakai, and Police Chief Miura all personally attended. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Wages Not Paid, Food and Clothing Deprived</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This spring, laborers from Hebei and Shandong were deceived by traitors and lured out of the customs. After the work outside the customs was completed, they were not paid a penny and were driven back inside the customs by the Japanese. Recently, more than 5,000 people have arrived in Luo County, without clothes or food, sleeping in the station and on the streets. Three or four people are freezing to death every day. The Luo County Orphanage has launched a fundraising campaign to send them back to their hometowns. According to the laborers, they were deceived to An Gu town, Heilongjiang Province, to build roads. Even when it rained, they did not stop. Each person was given only two corners for meals, which was only enough to be half full. Wages were not paid at all. Japanese soldiers supervised the work, and those who did not work hard were whipped, resulting in many deaths from emaciation. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan's Policy Towards Manchuria Consolidates Economic Interests</h3>
<p>Further Step in Aggression</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The reform plan for the Manchurian Resident Agency can be approved at the Provisional Cabinet Conference on the 22nd, and it is scheduled to be published in the official gazette on the 24th and implemented on the same day. At the same time, personnel decisions can be formally decided. The direction of the policy towards Manchuria, which will be launched at this time of implementation, is of concern to both China and foreign countries. The appointment of General Nami as plenipotentiary ambassador takes Japan's policy toward Manchuria, which has never been out of the scope of the country's national defense and maintenance of public order, a further step. The emphasis will be on the economy, and the policy will be changed. Ambassador Nami also revealed his ambitions at the Cabinet members' talk on the 14th, saying that future relations between Japan and Manchuria should focus on economic cooperation, and he advocated promoting the Japan-Manchuria Economic Conference as a concrete task. This is a clear testament and worthy of attention. Moreover, according to this plan, the lineup of agencies stationed in Manchuria will be renewed. Nagaoka Ryuichiro will be appointed as the director-general of the Kwantung Bureau, and Kawagoe Takeo will be appointed as the deputy director-general of the Manchurian Affairs Bureau. Therefore, Japan's policy toward Manchuria in the future will be consistently implemented by officials and civilians, with the formation of the Japan-Manchuria Economic Conference as the center, in the hope of concrete realization. Its future is indeed worthy of attention. (16th Japanese League Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Encouraging Domestic Industry</h3>
<p>In recent years, domestic factories have been struggling to survive, facing the impact of imported goods dumping from abroad and the decline of rural markets at home. Looking ahead, the hidden worries remain. Currently, all economically advanced countries, except France and Spain, have abandoned their original gold standard systems and are vying to lower their currency values in an attempt to break through tariff walls and develop markets. However, China's tariffs have not fully implemented a protectionist system, and foreign countries in China still have special political rights. The prices of their goods in the market are often lower than domestic products, thus domestic industries are in an even more difficult situation. Silk fabrics, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth are the most obvious examples. If we do not strive to improve, we may not have the opportunity to do so in the future. Currently, Japan is the most determined country in seeking economic stability, followed by Great Britain. Japan is solely focused on lowering the value of its currency to implement its monetary inflation policy, coupled with the stimulation of military industry. Great Britain focuses on developing colonial markets and uniting the economic alliance of the British Empire. The advancement of these trends each has its own limitations. Beyond these limitations, economic panic will inevitably be triggered on the other hand. As for the United States, the most industrially developed country, it is still stuck in the waves of panic. Therefore, it is now trying to sell manufactured goods overseas as a means of escape. The other countries are all pointing to the Far East, collectively regarding China as the only market in the world. Under this four-sided siege, how can domestic industries hope to open up a path, stabilize the domestic market, and make imported goods lose their competitive ability without outstanding spirit and long-term hard struggle?</p>
<p>China is not a country without potential. Human resources and material resources both have unique advantages, but they have not been fully utilized, so we often feel stretched. Currently, many places in the interior are still stuck in the handicraft era, with agriculture as the mainstay. Even the development of large cities such as Shanghai is only in the nascent form of modern industry. As a result, general wages are extremely low, and the quality of products is not as good as foreign goods. If further improvements are made and workers are given appropriate training, the quality of products will naturally improve, and we can begin to compete with foreign imports. Furthermore, China is rich in raw materials, which are available everywhere. Unfortunately, they have not been developed and organized. Domestic transportation is also often slow, so all kinds of advantages are often exploited by foreign merchants, while we retreat to second place, even only knowing how to transfer and sell, neglecting future development. For example, China has so much sheep wool and camel wool, and wool fabrics are very popular as clothing in cities. In theory, the wool textile industry could be thriving, but it is letting foreign goods dominate. There are many other industries similar to this, which is truly regrettable. In short, domestic factories should first conduct in-depth research on the sources of raw materials. Regarding the sales of their products, they must pay attention to whether they are necessary for daily life. We would like to offer the following advice based on our thoughts:</p>
<p>First, the development of an industry requires a considerable period of time, and the difficulties in the development process are often unexpected. Therefore, those responsible for planning should have a long-term vision and start from the near future. They should not make empty promises or exaggerate too much. They should first lay the foundation and then gradually expand. After a considerable period of time, they can compete with foreign goods.</p>
<p>Second, China's national economy as a whole is backward, and the industrial sector is dominated by small and medium-sized industries. These small and medium-sized businesses are easily eliminated in economic tides. When foreign goods are dumped, domestic industrial sectors should strive to avoid unreasonable competition among themselves, unite, and deal with foreign goods together.</p>
<p>Third, there is nothing wrong with borrowing from others and striving for improvement. However, domestic factories often take pride in emulating Western countries, not realizing that the human resources, material resources, historical geography, customs, and human feelings of Western countries are very different from those of China. Even if we learn the superficial aspects, it will not help the big picture. What we should pay attention to is the industrial development of Japan in the past forty years. Small and medium-sized industries in Japan still occupy an important position, and the conditions of human resources and material resources are very similar to those of China.</p>
<p>As for market development, we should first focus all our efforts on the domestic market. As for the consideration of product quality, we should cater to the needs of rural areas. If cities and rural areas can gradually return to the path of balanced development, the national strength will naturally increase and the people's livelihood will be prosperous.</p>
<h3>Europe Defaults on War Debts</h3>
<p>(Washington) Finland is the only country that has fully repaid its war debts to the United States that are due. Of the thirteen countries with a total of US$159,729,976 due this time, only Finland has paid the full amount, totaling US$228,538. (15th Day National Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome: The government here issued a statement today stating that the European countries' war debts to the United States are due again today, but the countries have sent notes to the United States, explaining the reasons for their inability to repay. The statement also said that according to the findings of the US Senate Investigating Committee, American arms dealers made huge profits from supplying arms to Europe during the European war, ranging from 40% to 362%. These huge profits came from the debts, and the US government levied heavy taxes on war profits, gaining a great deal. Therefore, in the eyes of European countries, the entire war debt issue has come to an end. (15th Day National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government today notified the US government, stating that the French government is unable to repay the war debts due today. After the publication of this note, the outside world learned that the US government had sent a note to the French government on November 22, expressing its willingness to start consultations with the government to resolve the war debt issue. It is unprecedented for the United States to insist on rejecting proposals for negotiations and to take the initiative to express its willingness to start negotiations with France. The French reply today stated that the French government has no objection to the US request and is also willing to consult with the US to find a mutually satisfactory solution, but at present, France cannot make concrete suggestions, which is regrettable. (15th Day National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the Treasury Department's announcement today, the total amount of US public debt has reached US$6,400,305,695, the highest number in American history, including the new short-term debt of US$967,863,000 issued last week. (15th Day National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Kirov's Successor</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The government announced today that it has appointed Idanov, the secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, to succeed Kirov, who was assassinated on the 2nd of this month, as the secretary of the Leningrad Party Committee. Idanov is 38 years old and has a similar status in the party to Kirov, and is also a confidant of Stalin. (16th Day National Telegram)</p>
<p>Leningrad: Idanov, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, was elected as the Secretary of the Leningrad Regional Party Committee and the Municipal Party Committee, succeeding the late Mr. Kirov. Mr. Idanov was born in 1896 in Mariupol, southern Russia. He joined the Communist Party in 1915 and has been working in Party affairs ever since. He was successively elected as an alternate member of the Central Committee in 1925 and 1927, and has been elected as a member of the Central Committee since 1930. At the 17th Congress in 1934, he was elected as Secretary of the Central Committee. (16th Day TASS Telegram)</p>

<p>Two Night Attacks Repelled</p>
<p>Air Force Reconnaissance Very Active</p>
<p>Tens of Thousands of Spectators After Exercise Completion</p>
<p>Singapore: A grand military exercise, the first of its kind here, has been held, with crowds gathering on the beach every day to watch the movement of artillery batteries. The grand military exercise of the Navy, Army and Air Force began last night. The first act was a destroyer attack on land, and the second attack will be held in the next 24 hours. Artillery, anti-aircraft guns and searchlights have been installed at strategic locations on land to prevent attacks. The Navy will attack from the direction of the China Sea. The attacking force consists of 18 destroyers and cruisers, supplemented by 24 aircraft. The defending aircraft have not yet been able to detect the location of the attacking force. It is believed that the attacking force will launch a fierce attack tomorrow morning. The coastal guard is now closely guarding the area, with telephones connected to the headquarters, ready to report everything at any time. (15th Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Singapore: The Singapore Navy, Army and Air Force grand military exercise began on Friday night. At that time, a destroyer fleet attacked Singapore.

The military appearance was quite impressive. Tens of thousands of people from various countries watched from the beach and the mountains. (16th Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>British, American, and Japanese Representatives Decide to Adjourn Naval Negotiations</h3>
<p>Responsibility for When to Reconvene Lies with Japan</p>
<p>Japanese Side Still Says There Will Be No Breakdown</p>
<p>(London) The naval talks among Britain, the United States, and Japan will be adjourned next week. Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira, British Foreign Secretary Simon, and American representatives Davis and Standley played golf at Walden Ball Park this morning. Simon and Matsudaira defeated Davis by a score of three to two. They then had lunch together and decided to adjourn the meeting. The date of the adjournment has not yet been decided. It is believed that it will be around the 20th or 22nd of this month, as Japan will also announce the abolition of the Washington Treaty around this date. At that time, regardless of the instructions received by the Japanese delegation from its government on this issue, it has been decided to adjourn the meeting. However, the nature of the adjournment has not yet been decided. British and Japanese representatives advocate a fixed-term adjournment, but it is heard that the American representatives believe that if the naval talks are to resume, the Japanese government should indicate now that it will not insist on equal shipbuilding demands at a later resumption, so as to block the path to progress. (15th Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) At the tripartite talks on the 15th, the US also agreed to adjourn the meeting 20 days before the Japanese government announces the abolition of the treaty and to negotiate a joint declaration of the three countries to be issued at the formal adjournment. The content of this declaration will strongly emphasize the effectiveness of the preparatory consultations over the past three months. The declaration is being drafted by the UK and seeks the approval of Japan and the US. Foreign Secretary Simon also proposed holding an informal British-Japanese meeting on the 28th after receiving the Japanese government's response to the Yamamoto-Child compromise proposal (15th Day Den-Tsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the compromise draft proposal for the disarmament preparatory negotiations made by the British and Japanese representatives in London, countermeasures have been decided at a joint meeting of the naval authorities. The specific plan is currently being vigorously studied by the naval command authorities. However, the essence of the above-mentioned compromise draft proposal, namely, where the maximum limit of naval power that Britain, the United States, and Japan should each possess should be placed, is the key point of the problem. Regarding this matter, Japan should recognize the principle of equal power of the British and American sides as a prerequisite. Unless this is clearly expressed, the Japanese side cannot propose concrete figures. Therefore, the principle figures for the amount of holdings of each country proposed by the Japanese side will be decided after the next convocation of the preparatory consultations in the next fiscal year. However, the Japanese government hopes that the preparatory negotiations will continue to be held in the future with the same enthusiasm as the British government. Therefore, the compromise draft proposal made by the British and Japanese representatives will generally be approached with an affirmative attitude. According to the current situation, these preparatory negotiations should not fall into a state of breakdown. (16th Day Japan United Telegram)</p>

<h3>US Plans to Dig Canals in Nicaragua and Uruguay</h3>
<p>277 Kilometers Long</p>
<p>Same as the Panama Canal</p>
<p>(Washington) Congressman Vincent, Chairman of the House Naval Committee, declared today that he will propose opening a canal in the next Congress, passing through Nicaragua, connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and said that the Navy and shipping industry have long advocated this matter, and now from a military point of view, it is necessary to dig the Nicaragua canal. (15th Day National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Congressman Vincent, Chairman of the House Naval Committee, is now planning to request Congress to pass a bill to allow the opening of a canal in Nicaragua. The canal is 277 kilometers long and the cost of opening it is estimated at 722 million US dollars. After completion, it can connect the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and have the same function as the Panama Canal. The canal will exit at Groton Port in the Atlantic Ocean and at Puerto Brito on the Pacific coast, and will use the two rivers of Tasaiba and San Juan and Lake Nicaragua and incorporate them into it. Vincent also said that he will soon discuss this issue with President Roosevelt. The United States and Nicaragua have signed a treaty allowing the United States to open a canal within Nicaragua, but this plan has not been realized. (16th Day Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>A Strange Drama in the Tokyo City Council</h3>
<p>City Councilors Spray Mayor with Water</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo City Council, which was expected to have disputes, held a meeting at 6 p.m. yesterday. The situation was very dangerous and was immediately adjourned. It was reopened at 7 p.m. and adjourned again without conducting business. After that, the meeting was opened three times. Ryuichi Takezawa went on stage, put water from the table in his mouth, and sprayed it on Mayor Ushizuka's face. The council hall suddenly became chaotic, and the meeting was adjourned again at 8:45 p.m. (16th Day Den-Tsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Also Exercises in the North Pacific</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Navy is currently studying the plan for the next fiscal year's major naval exercise among its officers and is planning to hold it in the North Pacific in the direction of the Kuril Islands, Hokkaido, and Sakhalin from July to October. All ships under the command of Commander-in-Chief Takahashi of the Combined Fleet must participate. On the other hand, the US Navy has also ordered a three-month major exercise in the spring, using the San Francisco, Hawaii, Alaska, and Dutch Harbor as a triangular area for the exercise. It seems that the eastern and western navies have chosen the North Pacific as the exercise site without prior agreement, which is quite interesting. (16th Day United Telegram)</p>
<h3>American Pacifists Advocate Compromise with Japan</h3>
<p>(New York) The General Secretary of the Peace Association, Mr. Lippmann, gave a speech here today, advocating the complete acceptance of Japan's proposal to abolish battleships, aircraft carriers, and large cruisers. Mr. Lippmann believes that the cause of all wars lies in economic problems. The United States is a major customer of Japan, so there should be no serious economic situation between the two countries, thus causing armed conflict. Mr. Lippmann also said that this economic relationship is sufficient to make Japan and the United States close friends, and this common interest is an important reason for maintaining peace. Mr. Lippmann does not support the argument that some quarters maintain a large navy to help China, because China has relied on its own strength for the past four thousand years to resist foreign aggression and assimilate aggressors. Mr. Lippmann expressed sympathy for Mr. Butler's recent advocacy of a defensive navy and predicted that the government's large navy argument would inevitably cause backlash in the next Congress. Mr. Lippmann finally declared that the United States' collusion with China would not help China's suffering. The United States no longer asks about European and Central and South American affairs, so why should it be responsible for vigilance in Asia? Enlightened self-interest is sufficient to correct Japan's relations with China and Russia, which is more effective than the threat of war, etc. (15th Day National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Franco-Italian Compromise Movement</h3>
<p>Understanding Reached on African Issues</p>
<p>(Paris) The Times reports that France and Italy have reached an understanding on the status of Italians in French Tunisia and the border issues between French Algeria and Italian Libya and an agreement could be concluded soon. (15th Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Le Matin published a commentary stating that France and Italy have almost reached a compromise on African issues, but Italy wants to include the results of this compromise in an agreement and immediately recognize it, so that the two countries can work together to solve two major European problems, namely, guaranteeing Austria's independence and improving relations between Italy and Yugoslavia. On the other hand, France wants to solve the two major European problems before concluding an agreement on African issues. This difference between the two sides is like the difference between the philosophies of Descartes and Spinoza. Italy uses the Cartesian method, while France uses Spinoza's logic. Let's wait and see who will win in the end. (16th Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Austrian-Hungarian Talks Successful</h3>
<p>Austrian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Return Home</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital: According to today's public announcement, all existing political and economic issues between Austria and Hungary have been successfully negotiated.

The public announcement also stated that the agreement was based on the agreement recently signed in Rome by Italy, Hungary, and Austria. The meeting between the two sides ended today. The Austrian Prime Minister will now set off to return home. (15th Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Budapest: Prime Minister Gömbös, cabinet members, and the Austrian and Italian envoys all went to the station to see off Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg when he departed. The Austrian Prime Minister stayed in the Hungarian capital for two days. Afterwards, the Hungarian authorities issued a public announcement, stating briefly that the leaders of the two countries had a friendly meeting and discussed not only economic issues, but also various political issues, with the Rome Protocol as the main body, and that their opinions were very consistent.

<h3>Franco-German Compromise Movement</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Recently, veterans from France and Germany have been contacting each other and carrying out activities in the wild to seek understanding between the two countries. A German named Perls has a good reputation among German veterans and has been trying his best for many years to establish contact between French and German soldiers. Perls recently published an article in a science magazine, stating that what the French nation is seeking is peaceful cooperation with Germany to jointly maintain world peace. French people measure people with two tools, one is loyalty and the other is wisdom. If the French say that they believe that you are honest, then this sentence is the highest praise. Whether for the French or the Germans, everyone has heard of it. If we do not take this into account when dealing with the French, then we will inevitably make a big mistake. Perls went on to say that many Germans believe that Franco-German understanding should be based on heroism, meaning that we can solve world problems by working together. If so, then it is absolutely impossible. If this is told to the French, they will definitely leave without looking back. In short, we must treat each other with sincerity and trust, have a broad vision, and know that France can never be separated from the Little Entente countries, nor can it withdraw from the League of Nations. If this is not understood, then all hope is futile. (16th Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Rumors of Discord Between the German Army and the National Socialist Party</h3>
<p>Goebbels' Denial</p>
<p>(Berlin) Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave a speech here today, stating that Germany has two main pillars, one is the National Socialist Party and the other is the Wehrmacht, and the German state is built on these two great pillars. Now that the National Socialist Party does not allow the existence of government outsiders outside of the party, the Wehrmacht should also follow suit and not allow others to carry weapons except for its own members. Goebbels went on to say that some foreign newspapers have been promoting the idea that there are differences of opinion between the National Socialist Party and the Wehrmacht, which is very childish and ridiculous, because the members of the Wehrmacht have sworn an enthusiastic oath, not only loyal to the country, but also loyal to Führer Hitler personally. Now, politicians and soldiers are united by sincere and enthusiastic friendship, so the army, the state, the party, and the nation have become an inseparable whole today.

<h3>Intention to Demand 20,000 Pounds in Compensation from Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Rome - Although the government of Abyssinia has appealed to the Council of the League of Nations to pay attention to the serious situation on the border between Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland, the Italian government remains unmoved. The Italian government claims that Walwal belongs to Italy and insists that Abyssinia should compensate for the loss of 20,000 pounds from the conflict between the two armies last week. The Abyssinian army should pay respects to the Italian flag in Walwal to show respect for Italy's sovereignty over the area. It is reported that on the 7th of this month, a conflict occurred between the Abyssinian and Italian armies in Walwal, with 60 Italian soldiers killed and more than 400 wounded. The Italian government immediately demanded a satisfactory reply from the Abyssinian government, but the Abyssinian government protested against this and yesterday appealed to the Council of the League of Nations, asking it to pay attention to Italy's aggression. According to the agreement signed by Italy and Abyssinia in 1908 to resolve the Walwal issue as soon as possible, the Walwal border has not yet been demarcated, resulting in frequent conflicts between the two sides. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) - Regarding the conflict between Italian troops and Abyssinians in the Walwal area, Abyssinia has made representations to the League of Nations. Abyssinia protested to the League of Nations in June 1926 regarding the British treaty signed in December 1925. The situation of this representation is quite similar. However, this representation by the Abyssinian government to the League of Nations is limited to recounting the incident and asking the League of Nations to pay attention. At the same time, Abyssinia has received official letters from the British and Italian governments, striving for reconciliation. Therefore, this representation will probably have no further developments, and the Council of the League of Nations may not intervene. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Electrical Production</h3>
<p>(Moscow) - The power plants under the jurisdiction of the Central Electricity Administration have completed their annual production plan before the end of the year.

<h3>The American Political Situation After the Re-election (American Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Roosevelt's Reputation Increases</p>
<p>The Republican Party's Prestige Declines Daily</p>
<p>The American re-election on November 6 resulted in an unprecedented victory for the Democratic Party. It occupied 68 of the 96 seats in the Senate, exceeding the two-thirds majority. In the House of Representatives, the Democratic Party also jumped from 309 seats to 317 seats out of 435 seats. The Republican Party decreased from 114 seats to 102 seats. In comparison, the Republican Party is indeed declining. Judging from the situation of this election, the next presidential election seems hopeless.</p>
<p>Since President Lincoln, the Republican Party's stronghold, such as Pennsylvania, had its Senate and governor seats won by the Democratic Party in this re-election. President Roosevelt is like a triumphant general. The reasons why Roosevelt achieved such results and completely overwhelmed the Republican Party are approximately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Roosevelt is not only diligent in political affairs, but also strives to plan for the economic future of the United States. Although he has not been able to achieve success in a short period of time, the scope of the panic is too large. If there were no efforts like Roosevelt's, the economic situation in the United States would be unknown. Therefore, Roosevelt is deeply respected. This is one reason.</p>
<p>(2) The "New Deal" is an economic policy that followed the National Industrial Recovery Act, focusing on industrial revitalization and unemployment relief. It is even more powerful than the National Industrial Recovery Act. Except for a few large capitalists, most of the people agree with it. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>(3) The Republican Party's so-called policy has no active solution to the current economic recession, but only attacks Roosevelt's policies, which further arouses the aversion of most people. Roosevelt has gained more practical benefits as a result. This is the third reason.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation in the United States, the Republican Party has suffered a painful defeat, and the Democratic Party has risen sharply, sweeping the country. It has a momentum of becoming a one-party state. Moreover, the Republican Party is not united internally, and new and old ideas often conflict. The party's political direction and internal organization seem to need to be reorganized. Although there is no hope of victory in the next presidential election, this re-election still received 12 million votes, and the future cannot be said to be completely hopeless.</p>
<p>As for the future economic, political, and diplomatic trends of the United States, they will gradually manifest after the Democratic Party's overwhelming victory in the re-election. Economically, Roosevelt will be more pragmatic and use his painful experience of years of restraining financial panic to relieve the current suffering. However, the number of unemployed people exceeds ten million, and it is not easy to make effective long-term relief. The clandestine development of leftist ideas is also becoming more intense due to the poor market conditions, and it is not easy to fundamentally stabilize the situation. Before the re-election, the opposition party tried its best to criticize, sincerely hoping for the victory of the election and to make Roosevelt completely succumb to the forces of large financial capital. Now the situation has changed, and the opposition parties are all silent, listening to him display his grand plans. Roosevelt, seeing that the power of financial capital cannot be underestimated, has also recently tried to approach bankers and industrialists, and has not changed his consistent conciliatory policy. Therefore, the stock market and commodity prices are showing signs of rising, but public debt is very weak, because there is fear that the expansionary policy will expand and the value of money will be lower.</p>
<p>At present, what all parties are paying attention to is the diplomatic issue, that is, what is the claim of the disarmament conference? Since the London Preparatory Meeting, the US government has not made any active or major expressions. However, the world knows that it will never lightly abandon the principles of the Washington Naval Treaty and accommodate Japan's so-called facts. Secondly, the European war debt problem has been delayed until now. Since it has not been resolved and the major countries have not paid, the US government is in a very difficult situation. The entanglement of US-Soviet debt has also been suspended until now and has not started negotiations. Even the reciprocal trade treaty, which is generally considered to be the most promising for the economic future of the United States, is stagnant. Therefore, knowledgeable people often say that it is the short-sightedness of the US rulers.</p>
<p>In fact, Roosevelt is also well aware of this. The reason why he has not taken active action is that the establishment of each international treaty must be approved by more than two-thirds of the Senate, otherwise, even if a treaty is concluded with the opposing country, it cannot be implemented. Before this, the Democratic Party had only 60 senators in the Senate, and it was difficult to guarantee that the proposal would not be rejected. Therefore, it was patient and cautious to see the result of the re-election. Now that it has real power and the approval of two-thirds is not a problem, it will be more insistent on the old ratio of diplomacy in the Western Pacific - the disarmament conference - and other international outstanding cases will also gradually show its active attitude.

<h3>Zhang Guojia, a Civil Aviation Aircraft Mechanic (Correspondence from Yugoslavia)</h3>
<p>Leshan</p>
<p>Has Ten Years of Aircraft Repair Experience</p>
<p>Trusted by Yugoslav Aviation Experts</p>
<p>Through the introduction of a friend, I met Captain Burgosi, a Yugoslav Air Force squadron leader. On the third day of my arrival in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, he informed my friend and invited me to cross the river to visit him at his air force garrison. Unfortunately, that morning, I had accepted an invitation from a German middle school to give a speech. It was around 3:00 PM when I rushed to his residence. He was an extremely sincere person. Although it was our first meeting, we were like old friends. He told me that they had been waiting for me almost all morning. It turned out that he had prepared a plane for me and planned to fly it himself, taking me for a stroll in the skies of Yugoslavia. Later, through a phone call, he learned that I would not be able to make it in time, so he gave up the idea.</p>
<p>During the conversation, his excessive fondness for China almost made me feel embarrassed, because in the current China, what is truly worthy of people's compliments? After he explained the whole reason, I understood his sincerity even more. He said, "My fondness for your countrymen is not groundless. You have a fellow countryman who has been a mechanic repairing machines in our unit for more than ten years. He is honest and hardworking, and has been like this for more than ten years. Such a person is not easy to see in Europe. We all like him very much."</p>
<p>"What is his ability?" I blurted out, hoping that this time I would discover an amazing person, because I knew that being an aircraft mechanic is not a very easy task.</p>
<p>"His ability?" Burgosi became very excited. "His ability is the best in our unit, the best expert. After any engine has been repaired by him, you can rest assured when he says 'Okay,' and there will never be any problems." Burgosi pointed to his prosthetic leg. "This, his right leg was injured and cut off in an airplane accident six years ago." He said with emotion, "That time, it just so happened that your compatriot had been transferred to another unit, so I suffered this great disaster. If he had been there, sir, I can guarantee that I would definitely have both legs complete today."</p>
<p>This made me even more curious, so I asked about his background and how he ended up in Yugoslavia as an aircraft mechanic. According to Burgosi, this Zhang Guojia is from northern China. He worked as a machine worker in the Imperial Russian Army since he was a child. After the Russian Revolution, he followed the Russian aviator Bydak to England, and then followed him to Yugoslavia. Bydak later changed his nationality to Yugoslavian. At this moment, he is also a squadron leader, and also considered the most famous aviator in Yugoslavia. Burgosi said, "If Zhang was not the best machine worker, then Bydak would not have taken him around everywhere. And," Burgosi said, "he has the spirit of a scientist. He likes machines so much that he can work all day long if he is interested and not feel tired."</p>
<p>We continued to chat, and I also learned that Zhang had married a Russian woman. Burgosi expressed 100% satisfaction with this marriage. He said, "You Chinese are indeed a cultured nation. I can see this from Zhang's marriage. Mrs. Zhang will never find a better man than Zhang. We Europeans do not respect married life as much as you Chinese do."</p>
<p>Burgosi also said, "A few days ago, I told Zhang that a compatriot of yours was coming here. He was very happy and hoped to meet you."</p>
<p>"Of course," I replied, "I think so too. Does he live near here?"</p>
<p>Burgosi called his guard to invite Zhang over. About ten minutes later, Zhang was standing in front of us. He appeared to be a middle-aged man in his forties, with a face weathered by time. My first words were, "Mr. Zhang, do you still remember Chinese?" He smiled and said, "I still remember a little bit, but I have hardly had the opportunity to speak it for a long time, and I have almost forgotten it all." So I asked Burgosi to excuse us for speaking Chinese. I talked with Zhang for half an hour. According to him, he was originally from Hebei Province. At the age of fourteen, he went to Russia with relatives and worked as a machine repair apprentice in Russia for many years. Later, he transferred to England, and from England to Yugoslavia. He has been here for exactly thirteen years. He still has parents, brothers, and sisters in China, but he has no news of their survival at this time. According to Zhang, he has also remitted money back to China, but because he has not received a reply, he has not continued to remit. I asked him if he wanted to return to China. He said, "I often think about going back, but the cost is too high, and I can't save that much money for the time being." I asked him about his experience in repairing airplanes. He said, "I have been working on this almost every day for twenty years, so I understand everything." I said, "If there is an opportunity in China where you can get a position, would you be willing to go back?" "Of course," was his reply. "As long as there is an opportunity, I am very willing to return to China." So he gave me his mailing address. This was my first satisfactory gain in Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Burgosi is one of the three major aviators in Yugoslavia. He graduated from the Army Military Academy in his early years, and then joined the Air Force, where he has been working for more than eleven years. He is not only a good aviator, but also has complete aviation knowledge. Since his accident, out of pain, he has become more focused on mechanical research. His cooperation with Zhang guarantees the safety of all the flight personnel in the team. His praise of Zhang is naturally the words of an expert, and Zhang's worthiness of our attention lies in this.</p>
<p>"Saving the country through aviation" seems to have become a popular phrase in China. Airplanes are purchased from foreign countries, repair mechanics come from foreign countries, and aviation instructors are foreigners. In this helpless phenomenon, the news of airplane accidents is also not uncommon. Here, we must understand that first, training aviation talents is not an easy task, and second, we cannot hire first- or second-rate foreign aviators. Similarly, even if we spend a lot of money to recruit a good repair mechanic, other countries will not let such talents leave the country, because good mechanics are the cornerstone of the air force. Their guarantee of aviation safety is at least 80%.</p>
<p>How difficult is it to organize an air force? European countries have concentrated national talents in this area, and it takes at least ten years of effort to be considered an aviation talent. Aviators not only understand how to fly, but also need to have all aviation knowledge, including the structure and repair of machines. However, this is still not enough. For example, there is a problem at present that fighter planes have always focused on defense, and bombers have focused on attack, but the latest type of bomber-fighter has two skills. At this point, the role of fighter planes will be questioned. Regarding this argument, what is the value of fighter planes? Because there is no practical experience, each side says its own reason and there is no conclusion. However, a complete air force talent cannot fail to understand this. Speaking of China at present, it is naturally still far from this, but we should open our footsteps and catch up.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think of Zhang Guojia, whose talents are used by others. Zhang's talent deserves to be the chief of the current aviation office, and letting a group of high school engineering graduates be his apprentices would be better than spending a hundred times the money to hire ten foreign engineers. Zhang's monthly salary in Yugoslavia is more than double that of his colleagues, but Burgosi still feels that it is not enough. He said, "Zhang's salary should be at least as much as mine, that's reasonable." Burgosi is currently an Air Force Captain, but he can be promoted to Air Force Major within two months because of his efforts. His regard for Zhang moved me very much.</p>
<p>I hope that soon Zhang will have the opportunity to return to his motherland with his wife by ship. (Belgrade, October 7, 1934)</p>

<h3>Little Tianshan and Hami Melons</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 18th, two horses belonging to the soldiers suddenly broke free from their reins and galloped away. The surrounding vegetation was lush, and the soldiers searched in all directions. They were finally found in the afternoon, but it was too late to reach the station, so they stayed at Liujia Village for another day. Two miles west of the village, there is another well in a trench used to irrigate 60 *fangli* of land. A farmer named Li Shijiang, nearing forty, had recently taken a beautiful Mongolian woman as a concubine. The Mongolian woman was an only child; her parents were both elderly. In the past, they and more than seventy other families of their tribe used to graze livestock on the Tianshan Mountains. When the unrest occurred twenty years ago, her entire tribe was killed. Only she and her father managed to escape early, thus surviving. Later, they used their hidden wealth to raise more than forty sheep, not daring to return to the Tianshan Mountains. She married Jiang to have someone to care for her parents in their old age, it is said. The reporter saw her flock of sheep, tall and sturdy, with fat, bifurcated tails, and some with brown fur, which he found quite unusual. Upon inquiring, he learned that they were of the Kazakh breed. He intended to buy one to reward the soldiers, but she refused, saying, "If I take your silver, there won't be any lambs born. If I keep the big sheep, they will still give birth to lambs. I won't sell, I won't sell." The soldiers brought her husband, Li Shijiang, to persuade her, but he also failed. Li then brought the woman's aged father, ordering her to sell, and she finally agreed. Although the woman had married Li, she maintained economic independence and was thus able to exercise her rights, still following Mongolian customs. Afterwards, the woman grabbed a sheep, first wiping its mouth with her sleeve, then stroking its head, making a gesture as if grasping something, and then tossing it towards the flock, before finally allowing it to be tied up and slaughtered. It is unknown what her intentions were. When the sheep was killed and its blood flowed onto the ground (Muslims are forbidden from eating animal blood), the soldiers' wives repeatedly dipped into the blood and smeared it on the foreheads and lips of their children, claiming that it would heal sores and scabies.</p>
<p>The Hami Tianshan range is commonly called the Little Tianshan. From the outside, its high peaks appear rugged, with snow gleaming brightly, resembling barren hills seemingly devoid of any produce. Yet, the interior is crisscrossed by mountain ranges, with valleys and peaks rising and falling, and dense forests, suitable for both farming and animal husbandry, truly a great treasury of Xinjiang's eastern route. The mountain's inhabitants consist of a mix of soldiers, Kazakhs, Han Chinese, and Mongolians. Originally, it was very populous, but during the upheaval twenty years ago, the soldiers and Kazakhs drove out and killed the Han and Mongolians. The Han and Mongolians fled completely, and the soldiers and Kazakhs also suffered greatly. Later, soldiers leaders such as Hejia Niyazi (the current vice chairman of the new provincial government) and Dr. Yao Le (the current garrison commander of Hami), deeply understood righteousness and willingly surrendered to the provincial government. Gold Mountain was briefly peaceful, but this spring, a certain group of Kazakhs from Ashan attacked and plundered Kobdo, and after defeat they fled to the mountains, continuing to loot. Not only was transportation between Dihua and Hami affected (the Kazakhs are fierce and savage, excelling at robbery, seizing people's property, and taking lives, cutting electrical wires for bullets, shooting people indiscriminately). Even postal workers were robbed and killed (the rest can be imagined). Even the soldiers, who share similar customs, do not regard the Kazakhs favorably. The Kazakhs do not dare to make any major moves, which may be a major reason. According to those familiar with the Tianshan situation, forty years ago, there were no Kazakhs in the Tianshan Mountains. Later, they gradually moved in from the north, recklessly plundering and killing. The soldiers also refer to them as savages. Yang Zengxin once took measures to drive out the Kazakhs. Currently, there are approximately 5,000 Kazakh tents (households) in the mountains, with a population of 20,000 to 30,000. The soldiers mostly live in Badashi, with approximately 500 households and over 2,000 people, it is said.</p>
<p>The next day, we departed Liujia Village. The road was winding, with lush vegetation. The cavalry moved in single file, unable to see the head from the tail. After thirty *li*, we arrived at Huanglugang, which connects with the post road from Changliushui. Formerly, there were fifteen or sixteen farm families, cultivating a thousand *mu* of land. Now, the houses are collapsing, and the people are gone, leaving desolation everywhere, with only a few tall poplars rustling in the autumn wind. After fifteen *li* of flat grassland, we reached "One Tree." Soldiers and Han Chinese live there together, approximately forty families. There is a canal from the Tianshan Mountains that can irrigate several thousand *mu* of land. Due to the impact of the upheaval twenty years ago, the residents have not yet fully returned. From here on, we saw forests in all directions, completely enveloping the villages. Although the sounds of chickens and dogs could not be heard, the smoke from the kitchen chimneys was clearly visible. Recalling our previous journey through the vast and desolate desert, where we often did not see a single person for hundreds of *li*, witnessing this human scene brought a refreshing feeling. The soldiers' officers accompanying us were mostly from the vicinity of One Tree. They asked to take the opportunity to return home for a night, promising to enter Hami together by noon the next day. The reporter and Ahximu Misha, etc., continued for thirty-five *li*, making a detour to "Diegewei Fort," staying overnight at Misha's father-in-law's house. The sky was not yet dark, and we originally planned to rush into Hami City, but we were afraid that the soldiers would arrive late the next day, making it inconvenient to report, so we did not. "Diegewei Fort" has intersecting canals, and the fields are fertile. The autumn harvest had just passed, and the new grain was on the threshing floor. In the fields, only safflowers and cotton remained, with a few scattered bolls. There were approximately twenty families of farmers, all soldiers. The clothing of the men and women appeared foreign. However, their farming practices, such as wheat threshing, cotton picking, and plowing, and the agricultural tools they used, were completely the same as those in the northwestern provinces (especially Gansu). Misha's father-in-law, named Sima Yin, welcomed us into the room, and laid out a variety of Hami melons, walnuts, *nang* bread, dried milk curd, etc. His wife, wearing a green dress and red jacket, with a white veil covering her head, squatted by the *kang* stove (a heated platform connected to the stove), cutting melons and preparing noodles. Misha's mother-in-law carried a bucket, repeatedly drawing water from the canal, returning to squat in front of the stove to add fuel. The younger brother sharpened a knife, preparing to slaughter a Kazakh sheep outside. The whole family offered sincere hospitality, showing the utmost kindness to their guests.</p>
<p>Hami melons are divided into two types: watermelon and honeydew melon. Watermelons are no different from those in the inland regions, except they are larger and sweeter. Honeydew melons are oblong, with a yellow-green outer skin and white cracks. When sliced, the flesh is pink, or sometimes yellow-white. The seeds are similar to pumpkin seeds, but smaller and longer. Other produce such as pumpkins, gourds, squashes, cucumbers, honeydew squashes, and bitter melons (the soldiers do not eat bitter melons but sell the seeds to merchants from Hunan and Sichuan) are also produced here. However, the term "Hami melon" generally refers specifically to honeydew melons. Honeydew melons have a very sweet and delicious taste. In the Qing Dynasty, they were used as tribute. The reporter had a toothache, but the melon was sweet and cooling, and after eating it, the ailment seemed to disappear. I suddenly recalled that in the spring, when bidding farewell to colleagues in Beijing, we talked about the roundabout journey. Mr. Ma Qunchao smiled and said, "If you go to Hami like this, you may arrive during melon season." I thought with the delays on the road, it would not be so late. Who knew that by the time we arrived in Hami, the melon harvest was already a month ago!</p>
<p>The method of planting honeydew melons is to till the land into long ridges, about seven or eight feet wide, with long furrows in between, about three feet wide and deep. In early summer, the seeds are buried on the edge of the ridge, about an inch deep, without watering. A month later, when the sprouts appear and are about to flower, a hole is dug from the furrow, horizontally under the roots, and a small amount of sheep or horse manure is inserted, then the hole is sealed. Three or four days later, the furrows can be irrigated. From then on, the vines spread and blossom, and the melons form. By Mid-Autumn Festival, they are fully ripe and stored indoors, with the stem end facing up, standing upright. They can be stored until March or April of the following year without spoiling. Those from Turpan can even be eaten the following year. They can be sliced, dried in the sun, and made into dried melon, as sweet as candied fruit. Nanhushaw in Turpan has no flies, making it a natural place for drying melons. Large quantities are transported for sale to inland regions and the Soviet Union. Some say that melon seeds must be stored in ash for one or two decades, and that they are often irrigated with licorice water, but this is not accurate.</p>
<p>[P The Sichuan Situation After Liu Xiang's Return &gt;</p>
<p>Troops from All Sides Are Deployed Tightly to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Prioritize the Establishment of the Provincial Government to Organize National Taxes</p>
<p>A communication from Hankou: Liu Xiang arrived in Hankou on the 13th aboard the Wuxue steamboat, having traveled from Beijing. He was originally scheduled to take a plane the next day to return to Sichuan via Yichang, but due to heavy fog, flying was not possible and was postponed for one day. On the morning of the 15th, he, along with Secretary-General Zhang Biguo and Section Chief Leng Kaitai, took the Anqing postal plane westward. At 10:30 a.m., they stopped briefly in Shashi, where they discussed defense matters in the border area between Sichuan and Hubei with Xu Yuanquan. At noon, they arrived in Yichang, planning to switch to the Bayu or Minkang steamboat on the morning of the 16th to enter Sichuan. During his stay in Hankou, Liu repeatedly stated that he would follow the Central Government's orders in all military and political matters. He also made no secret of the reasons for the previous failures in suppressing bandits, the drawbacks of the defense zone system, and the heavy burden and deep suffering of the people of Sichuan. However, when asked about the whereabouts of Liu Congyun, he smiled and did not answer, seemingly still feeling guilty. When Liu passed through Wanxian, he convened a meeting of the generals to discuss and give instructions. He will next go to Chongqing, and then proceed to the front to supervise the suppression. A general offensive order for the entire line can be expected in the shortest possible time. On the political front, the establishment of the provincial government will be prioritized, and the organization of national taxes is particularly emphasized by the Central Government. It has been decided to establish a special financial commissioner for Sichuan to first organize the salt tax, followed by others. (15th)</p>
<h3>An Interview with Wu Peifu</h3>
<p>Highly Praising Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's New Life Movement</p>
<p>A communication from Beiping: Wu Peifu, who is residing in the old capital, recently held a banquet when Chairman Chiang Kai-shek came to Beiping. A reporter visited him yesterday, and Wu expressed strong support for the New Life Movement promoted by Chiang. His comments and recent situation are described below. Wu's old family is now outside the north gate of Penglai County, Shandong Province, managed by his nephew. Only his wife, originally from the Northeast, resides with Wu in Beiping. In addition, he also raises a young grandson to enjoy his later years. Former subordinates and staff who stayed with Wu through his wandering in Sichuan and Gansu also accompany Wu, not leaving to this day. However, the civil and military officials from the heyday of Luoyang have long since scattered and are no longer in contact. Yesterday afternoon, when the reporter met with Wu, Wu was wearing a blue silk robe and was in very high spirits. After exchanging greetings, he answered the reporter's questions as follows:</p>
<p>What are the similarities and differences between old and new morality? (Answer) Morality does not have old or new. Our country's inherent political culture is superior to the world, so it is necessary to preserve and carry it forward. (Question) What is the essence of old morality? (Answer) The morality of Chinese Confucianism is human relations. The foundation of ethics lies in filial piety. The difference between humans and animals is that humans know how to be filial to their parents, while animals do not. Look at the horses raised in the stables of those high officials, their enjoyment exceeds that of poor people tenfold. Parrots are skilled at learning languages and are more intelligent than people with poor speech. The reason why we cannot call these horses and birds "humans" is that they do not understand propriety and filial piety. (Question) So the Chinese sages advocated that one word, filial piety, could govern the country and bring peace to the world, is that the reason? (Answer) Correct. The foundation of establishing a country lies in education, and the foundation of nurturing talent lies in making people "human," clarifying the distinction between humans and animals, and knowing propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. This can stabilize society and maintain public virtue. The foundation of good governance and peace depends on this. (Question) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's New Life Movement guidelines are very much in line with your statement. Are you also in sympathy with the New Life Movement? (Answer) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's New Life is very much in line with my usual advocacy of using the Four Cardinal Principles to govern the country. Although Zhou was an old state, its mandate was renewed. There is no distinction between new and old. (Question) The development of the Northwest has become a national policy of China. What are your thoughts? (Answer) Everyone knows that the Northwest is China's treasure house, but abandoning its benefits to the land and not developing it for a long time is a miscalculation. I previously passed through Gansu from Sichuan and returned to Beiping via Mongolia. I saw that in Koubei, a *jin* of wool could be purchased for two or three *mao* coins, almost cheaper than cotton. If it could be processed into wool yarn, the cost would be no more than four or five *mao* coins. In recent years, many men and women wear woolen clothes, all of which are foreign goods. If factories can be set up in the Northwest to manufacture goods locally, not only will the common people in the Northwest increase production and reduce unemployment, but the country will also stop a major drain on resources.

<h3>Conscription Committees Established in Various Counties of Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>丨Conscription of Men Has Already Begun丨</p>
<p>A communication from Nanchang: The Jiangxi authorities, having received orders to implement the conscription system, had the Security Department prepare the various procedures for conscription and formulate various measures to be implemented by the provincial conscription committee. The provincial government also ordered the county governments to organize conscription committees with the heads of various bureaus to oversee conscription matters in their respective counties. Previously, in order to cultivate middle and lower-level cadres, the provincial government established a junior military officer training class. Upon completion of the training, the personnel were assigned to various counties to organize teams. One-third of the personnel of each team were added to the first group of conscripts. After receiving the order, the counties began to conscript men. All men between the ages of twenty-one and forty are subject to conscription. However, for the purpose of screening, physical examinations are conducted in advance. Those who pass are then selected by lottery and sent to camp for training. With this process, Jiangxi Province will move forward towards the conscription system, where civilians are soldiers and soldiers are civilians. (11th)</p>

<h3>Liu Zhenhua Goes to Tunxi</h3>
<p>Zhejiang and Anhui Armies Painfully Suppress Remaining Bandits</p>
<p>A communication from Wuhu: The remnants of Luo Binghui's bandits in the Huizhou area were previously besieged by a large army and fled elsewhere. There are no longer any bandits in the Huizhou area. Provincial Chairman Liu Zhenhua led important staff members of the Tunxi Administrative Office back to Anqing and then went to Qiupu and other places to inspect. Luo's bandits recently invaded Jingde, Ningguo, Jixi, and other counties, but were unsuccessful. They have now retreated north towards the Congshanguan area. In recent days, a certain division has also been successively departing from Wuhu and heading towards Xuancheng. It will not be difficult to eliminate the remaining bandits. This division posted notices in Wuhu, strictly prohibiting the creation of rumors and disturbances. To stabilize the people's hearts, they will be checking pedestrians every night from 10 p.m. Last night at 11:10 p.m., Liu Zhenhua arrived in Wuhu from Anqing aboard the Anfeng chartered boat, accompanied by Chief of Staff Zhu Runzhai, Secretary-General Chen Shikai, and Border Region Pacification Commissioner Liu Yigong of the Headquarters. Liu Maoen, commander of the 11th Route Army, arrived at the headquarters a day earlier to welcome them. After Liu met with local officials, he stayed on the boat. This morning, he disembarked and took a car directly to the Tunxi Administrative Office. According to Chief of Staff Zhu, Liu's trip to Huizhou is to supervise the various departments to eliminate the remaining bandits. Currently, Zhejiang Security Director Yu Jishi is leading a large army in two routes of pursuit. Commander Zhao Guantao and the various armies on the (unclear) route have also dispatched troops to cooperate. The bandits hiding in the four counties of Qimen, Zhide, Fuliang, and Peng have long been annihilated, and their important nests have been flattened. The area has largely been pacified, etc. (14th)</p>
<h3>Female Director Newly Appointed to Shandong Province's Cattle Registration Bureau</h3>
<p>Longkou Newly Establishes Cattle Registration Sub-Bureau</p>
<p>Ms. Cheng is Appointed as Director</p>
<p>A communication from Jinan: In recent years, the women's professional movement has shown vigorous growth. Government offices in various provinces and cities have employed female staff. Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, appointed Ms. Cheng Guixiang, a clerk in the provincial government, who has been working for many years, is diligent and hard-working, as the Director of the Longkou Cattle Registration Sub-Bureau. The news has spread and is being widely praised. It is rare to appoint a woman as the head of a tax collection agency. The reporter recently visited Cheng's residence at 8 Shualu Lane, and the results of the interview are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ms. Cheng's name is Guixiang, she is thirty-two years old, and she is from Zouping County. She graduated from the former Women's Class A Vocational School (now the Second Vocational School) in the sericulture department. Upon graduation, she worked as an elementary school teacher in Zouping. Later, she taught at the affiliated elementary school of the Qufu Second Normal School for four years. In 1928, the Northern Expeditionary Army arrived in Shandong, and the provincial government was established in Tai'an. She then served as a staff member in the Training Department of the provincial party headquarters. Later, she was transferred to the provincial government as a clerk by Shi Jingting, Chairman of the Provincial Government. Since then, the provincial government has been reorganized several times, but Cheng has never been transferred. When the provincial government moved north, Cheng followed to Jinan and has been working there ever since. Cheng married at the age of twenty-four, and her husband, Han, is seven years younger than her. She saves money from her salary, cutting back on food and clothing, to support her husband's education. After her husband graduated from high school, he successively worked as a staff member in the Commodity Inspection Bureau and the Construction Department, but is now unemployed at home. Ms. Cheng plans to have her husband as her accountant after she goes to the Longkou sub-bureau. Ms. Cheng has three children, the oldest of whom is seven years old and attends the affiliated elementary school of the First Normal School. The second is five years old and has not yet started school. Ms. Cheng uses her spare time in the evenings to personally tutor them. The youngest is still in her arms. Ms. Cheng's mother has passed away, but she still has an old father and two brothers. One brother farms at home with her father, and the other serves as a cooperative instructor in Linqu County. According to Ms. Cheng, she has always been diligent in her work. Therefore, she has been in one agency for several years. However, in the past, she had always relied on her superiors in her work and was not responsible. Now, she is going to Longkou to manage the cattle registration sub-bureau, which is an independent agency. She feels that she lacks experience, and the Longkou sub-bureau is newly established, which is not the same as taking over an existing one, so things will be more complicated. However, she will follow the chairman's intentions and entrustment, and do her best to work hard, in order to live up to the expectations of her superiors and society, and to win glory for women and open up new paths for her sisters.

<h3>Post-Disaster Management in Western Fujian</h3>
<p>Relief Funds of 40,000 Yuan Are Used to Purchase Rice and Transport it to Tingzhou for Relief</p>
<p>The Provincial Government Asks the Headquarters to Lift the Blockade Order</p>
<p>A communication from Fuzhou: The provincial government received a telegram from Changting from Xiao Gan, Director of the Security Department, reporting that the bandit areas in western Fujian had been recovered, but there was a shortage of food, widespread disease, ruined roads, and desolate farmland, urgently in need of relief. Chairman Chen Yi telegraphed the Nanchang Headquarters, requesting a large sum of relief funds and requesting the Nanjing Health Department to send personnel with medicines to Fujian to diagnose and treat the sick. The Health Department has now dispatched physician Yao Ruzheng, leading a treatment team, who entered western Fujian from southern Jiangxi a few days ago. They have established a temporary hospital in Changting to treat patients, and sent personnel to various villages to examine illnesses. The Nanchang Headquarters has also remitted 20,000 yuan in relief funds, and another 20,000 yuan has been raised in the province. These funds are being used by Chen Peikun, Chairman of the Provincial Relief Committee, to purchase food in Zhangzhou, transport it to Tingzhou for relief, and transport a large amount of salt stored in Shanghang to be sold at low prices. At the same time, the provincial government also submitted a request to the Nanchang Headquarters stating that the bandit areas in western and northern Fujian had been completely recovered and that refugees were gradually returning to their hometowns, requesting permission to lift the blockade order (the coastal counties of eastern Fujian, where the remaining bandits are still being suppressed, will have their blockade lifted later). Merchants are allowed to freely transport rice, salt, cloth, medicine, and various daily necessities to be sold there to provide relief. In addition, 10,000 yuan for the expenses of the highway connecting western Fujian to southern Jiangxi has also been remitted by the Economic Commission. The Construction Department plans to recruit 1,500 workers in northern and southern Fujian to transport them to Liancheng and Changting to engage in construction, so that traffic can be restored in the shortest possible time. The Eighth District Administrative Commissioner's Office has also moved from Liancheng to Changting. The Rural Finance Relief Office has also established an office in Tingcheng to jointly handle rural relief matters, lending money to farmers to purchase farming tools so that they can start farming next spring. All refugees who have fled to various places must be sent back to their hometowns by the end of the year. In addition, the local education in the recovered areas needs to be restored urgently. The Special Education Department established by the Education Department has recruited 50 students for a short-term training class, who will be trained for two weeks and then sent to Changting, Ninghua, Liancheng, Mingxi, and Qingliu to open Zhongshan People's Schools. Another 100 students will be recruited for a long-term training class, who will be trained for three months and then sent to various counties to open simple elementary schools. According to the authorities' estimate, the area can be largely restored within six months. (12th)</p>
<h3>Taiwanese People Provoking Again in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>丨Setting Up Gambling Dens and Beating Police丨</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Recently, Taiwanese vagrants' foreign gambling dens have been revived in the province, which greatly hinders public security during this winter defense period. The provincial government has negotiated with the Japanese consulate, and the Japanese consulate has agreed to dispatch Japanese police to jointly search the gambling dens with our police. In recent days, more than 70 gamblers have been arrested and detained in the Public Security Bureau for punishment. The gambling dens were ordered to be closed by the Japanese consulate (in reality, they only closed for a few days and then reopened as usual). The Taiwanese vagrants harbored resentment in their hearts and often thought of taking revenge. On the morning of the 7th, at the Shengsheng gambling den opened by a Taiwanese woman, Chen Xu, in Huang Lane, South Street, several gamblers were arrested by the police again. At 2 p.m., three Taiwanese men rushed out of the gambling den to Huang Lane, intending to capture Tao Derong, a police officer stationed at South Street, and drag him into the gambling den. Officer Tao resisted, but was outnumbered and severely injured in the head, face, chest, and back. The skin was broken and bleeding. Onlookers were indignant and shouted to stop them. Unexpectedly, the three Taiwanese men each took out a bomb and threw it at the crowd, then swaggered back into the gambling den. The passersby were terrified at the sight of the bombs and fled in panic. Nearby shops also closed their doors. The market was in chaos for a while. Fortunately, the bombs did not explode, thus avoiding disaster. The Public Security Bureau and the Military Police Corps were informed and immediately dispatched police and military police to maintain order, and the market gradually returned to normal. The injured police officer was sent to the hospital for treatment, and the bombs were retrieved as evidence for negotiation. The Japanese consulate was notified by telephone, requesting them to send police to investigate the scene and jointly search the gambling den. The Japanese consul immediately dispatched Japanese Police Chief Nakanishi Hiroji, along with Taiwanese police officer Li Caiwang and others, to investigate by car. Our military police requested to go to the gambling den for a joint search, but the Japanese police refused and went inside alone. They came out after about half an hour and only said, "Both sides have misunderstandings." Then they left by car. Now our side believes that the Taiwanese men ganged up to block the street and beat the police and threw bombs in public, which is damaging police authority and disturbing the local area. A serious negotiation will be initiated with the Japanese consulate, but the outcome is unknown. In addition, Xu Akang and other Taiwanese men who robbed Qianzhong Money Shop in front of the Great Temple were captured by our side and handed over to the Japanese consulate. However, many days have passed, and there is still no news of their handling. Some say they have been released and returned to Taiwan, which shows that the Japanese side deliberately condones the evil deeds of Taiwanese vagrants (December 12).</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Suppression of Bandits in Guizhou and Guangxi</h3>
<p>Remaining Bandits Flee to the Northwest of Qianjia Temple</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After Zhu Peng's communist bandits collapsed and retreated to the border of Guangxi, the Guangxi province dispatched troops to enter Guizhou via a detour to assist the Guizhou army in blocking and attacking. At the same time, they tracked and suppressed the remaining communists in northern Guangxi, and have captured many in the vicinity of Xing'an in recent days. According to a telegram from the General Staff Office of the Guangxi Army in Guilin yesterday: "(1) According to a telegram from Army Commander Xia (Wei), on the 5th, the bandits who resisted our army at Qianjia Temple were the bandit troops of Dong Zhengtang's department of the Pseudo-Wang Army Corps, flanking the 13th Division. Dong and the Pseudo-Political Commissar Zhu Rui had dinner at Qianjia Temple at 8 p.m. last night, and our Liang Regiment rushed in. The bandits fled in panic. Our army occupied Qianjia Temple that night and captured many prisoners. According to the bandits, after being defeated at Xinxu and Shitangxu, the Pseudo-3rd and 5th Army Corps were no longer organized. Each company had only about 20 combat soldiers and lacked ammunition. The remnants fled north. (2) According to a telegram from Director Wei (Yun Song) of Yuyou, a part of the bandits who were defeated by us in Guanbei fled into the Yao mountain area of Dayuan Baoji Matouling in Guanshu. After our division jointly suppressed them with the militia, more than 500 bandits were captured, and many guns, horses, telephones, and wireless radios were seized. More than 1,000 remaining bandits fled to Mao'eryuan and are now being surrounded and resolved. (3) It is found that the bandits fleeing west are still within the territory of Xing'an Longsheng, west of the Qingdian B Qianjia Temple line, north of the Zhongdong of Qianjia Temple, and east of the Furong River mouth line. The area is mountainous and the roads are narrow. According to their situation, there are no more than 40,000 bandits remaining. Since they were repeatedly defeated by our army in Guanbei, they have fled in a panic and become frightened birds. They flee as soon as they are shot, and even a platoon of our army captures hundreds of bandits and guns. The combat effectiveness of the bandits has been completely lost. Now, in addition to using one division and the militia to clean up the remaining scattered bandits, the Xia and Liao armies are dividing into two routes to contact friendly forces to block and suppress them. Special report, printed by the General Staff Office of the Fourth Army Group in Guilin." According to a telegram from Wang Jialie, the commander of the 25th Army of Guizhou Province: "The two bandit leaders, Xiao and He, met at Nanyaojie and planned to gather the remaining bandits in an attempt to counterattack and re-redden the original bandit areas. After our Commander Liu (Jiyan) ordered the armies to track and suppress them, 600 to 700 bandits were killed in the Longtou area on the 6th, and hundreds of bandits were captured, along with many guns. The bandit troops turned to the border of Sichuan and fled, with the intention of going east to respond to the Xu bandits in northern Sichuan." Special report, Wang Jialie bowed, printed on the 7th.

<h3>Director Shen of the Jiangsu Construction Department Admonishes Employees Involved in Work Relief</h3>
<p>This year's drought in Jiangnan is unprecedented in decades. The authorities of Jiangsu Province are deeply concerned about it and have organized work relief and conducted planning. Fortunately, it has been successfully completed. Now, Director Shen of the Construction Department has issued "A Letter to Employees Inside and Outside the Work Relief Office for Drought Disaster" to encourage the personnel involved in the work. The general idea is: "The work relief for the drought disaster in Jiangnan has been planned for several months and has started this month. Now, at the beginning of the work, there are things that must be told to the employees inside and outside. Because our Jiangsu is in the aftermath of the disaster, and the financial and physical strength are exhausted to the extreme, we are still trying to raise huge sums to organize work relief because natural disasters can be remedied by human efforts. Work relief can not only save the victims at present, but also open up water conservancy in the future. Once the drought is removed, the countryside will prosper. How important and difficult is the work and responsibility? All of us, employees involved in the work, should pay special attention to the eight characters 'work returns to practice, and money is not afraid of waste,' and put them into practice. Chairman Chen said, 'In this autumn of national crisis and survival, when organizing undertakings, one penny must be used as ten pennies, and one person must exert the strength of ten people. The future of China can be hoped for.' I would like to share these words with all of you involved in the work. Otherwise, considering the difficulty of the provincial government in raising funds, the urgency of the victims waiting for relief, and the bankruptcy of the countryside and the lack of water conservancy, all those with blood and energy will feel deeply empathetic. If the work is not done well, living idly and letting the important work be delayed and the good policies be in vain, both material and spiritual things will be wasted. When you examine your heart at night, you will not be startled, ashamed, and blamed by your conscience."</p>

<h3>Business Community Asks for Severe Punishment in Daytime Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 9 a.m., the Rilan Silver Shop in Fengle Bridge in this city was robbed. Except for Qiu, one of the robbers who is at large, Zhao Zhengyi, the robber who was captured, has been interrogated by the Security Brigade and has fully confessed. The seized pistol has the stamp of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. Because the robbery occurred in a prosperous commercial area in broad daylight during the winter defense period, all merchants believe that the future is dangerous if no protection is planned. They have asked the county chamber of commerce to preside over the matter. Chairman Cai telegraphed the county magistrate to set up protection and also telegraphed the provincial government, requesting that the case be handled strictly according to law to serve as a warning.</p>

<h3>Another Murder Case in Penglai Town</h3>
<p>Zhang Aquan, a farmer from Yong'an Township, Penglai Town, under the county, has a prosperous family. He has hired Mao Yigen, a native of Changshu, as a long-term worker for ten years. Recently, Yigen had an affair with a neighbor's wife, which angered the master. At about 2 p.m. the day before yesterday, the master and servant had an argument, and then fought. Aquan then gathered the villagers and beat Mao severely, killing him on the spot. The murderer escaped without a trace. Zhang Ziying, the first head of the township, reported to Qian Yuanli, the head of the township, who in turn reported to the county government, requesting an on-site inspection.

<h3>Poor Sales of Rice</h3>
<p>The rice market in this county has been weakening recently. The decline has been particularly significant in the past two days. The reason is that the supply is quite strong, but the sales are sluggish. White glutinous rice and indica rice have both fallen by one or two cents.

<h3>Coastal Blockade Cuts Off Supply to Bandits</h3>
<p>Nearly 18 bandit ships have invaded the coasts of Nantong. The bandits are extremely cunning. As soon as the troops arrive, they set sail and flee far away, and from time to time use shallow beaches to land, rob, and kill. The county magistrates and military police of the coastal counties have jointly decided to block the coast immediately, cutting off the supply of firewood, rice, fresh water, and other items to the pirates, and strictly prohibit sending people to negotiate ransom.</p>

<p>The night boat traveling from Huzhou to Si'an in this city left Huzhou for Si'an at about 4 p.m. the day before yesterday. It was already dark when it passed the Dajiao Bridge area near Hongxing Bridge. Suddenly, seven or eight bandits with guns shouted to stop the boat on the shore. The boat crew dared not resist because the bandits had guns. They berthed the boat and allowed the bandits to board and rob. All the clothes and silver dollars of the passengers were robbed. Afterwards, the boat owner reported the incident to the military and police authorities in Hongxing Bridge for investigation.</p>

Now that the north wind is howling and the severe winter is approaching, the situation will inevitably lead to widespread starvation in the fields. Recently, it was heard that the association, in order to seek urgent relief, has jointly contacted the Beijing, Zhenjiang, Wuhan, Pingjin, and other branches, and urgently telegraphed County Magistrate Zhong of the county, requesting that the bonus of about 30,000 yuan raised from the recovered old taxes, and the county magistrate's office expenses of 1.3% of the collection fee, be allocated to the disaster relief in this county to save the victims.</p>

<h3>Letter from Jiashan County Court</h3>
<p>To the editor, I have read the news on the second page of your newspaper on the 12th of this month, which reported on the transfer of the President of the Jiashan District Court. It said, "The new president, Shen Bida, is from Xiaoshan and is the younger brother of the famous lawyer Shen Erqiao of this province. He is scheduled to arrive in Jiashan on the 11th to handle the handover." Although the president of this court is from Xiaoshan, he has no kinship with the lawyer Shen Erqiao and has never known him. The news reported does not conform to the facts and should be corrected to show the truth. Sincerely, Jiashan County Court, Zhejiang. December 15.</p>

<h3>Central Committee Member Dai Jitao and Others Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Ma Chaojun Talks About the Situation of the Fifth Plenary Session</p>
<p>Sun Ke Succeeds as President of the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>Central Committee members Dai Jitao, Ma Chaojun, Xue Pianbi, Wang Faqin, Zhang Dingfan, Qian Dajun, Zhang Qun, Zhang Huichang, Dai Kuisheng, Huang Shi, Gui Chongji, and others, after attending the Fifth Plenary Session, left Beijing the night before and arrived in Shanghai by car at 7:30 a.m. yesterday. Mr. Ma met with reporters from the Xinsheng News Agency at his residence. According to him, the spirit of this Fifth Plenary Session was very good, and the opinions of the various committees were also very harmonious. They all felt that the national crisis was becoming increasingly serious and that the whole country must unite. As for Mr. Sun Zhesheng's resignation as President of the Legislative Yuan, it was entirely due to the expiration of his term. The term of the President of the Legislative Yuan is two years, so he resigned upon the expiration of his term. Now, after the retention of the various committees, Mr. Sun has agreed to continue to serve and complete his work. The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold a meeting on Monday next week to discuss the Civil Procedure Law. Therefore, Mr. Sun will not come to Shanghai recently. As for Mr. Hu Hanmin's arrival in the north, after the meeting between Mr. Sun and Mr. Wang (Chonghui) in the south, there is hope that he will come to Shanghai, but it has not been scheduled. After returning to Beijing, Mr. Sun only reported the results of his trip to the south to the Standing Committee and did not report to the General Assembly, because Mr. Sun was entrusted by the Standing Committee when he went south. Since Mr. Jiang and the main figures of the Central Committee earnestly hope for unity, the future seems promising.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Arrival in Shanghai of Guangdong Finance Commissioner Qu Fangpu</h3>
<p>Denial of Guangdong Provincial Government's Loan from American Banking Syndicate</p>
<p>Publication of Written Statement on Guangdong Province's Military and Political Affairs</p>
<p>Mr. Qu Fangpu, the Commissioner of Finance for Guangdong Province, arrived in Shanghai the other day from Hong Kong aboard the Changxing Company's steamship "Empress of Canada," accompanied by Mr. Wen Zhongqi of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and Mr. He Shaoqiong, Section Chief of the Finance Department. The ship arrived at 9:30 yesterday morning, docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. Those who went to welcome them included Mr. Li Dachao, representing Mayor Wu, Mr. Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang stationed in Beijing, and more than ten relatives and friends of Mr. Qu in Shanghai. After disembarking, Mr. Qu, along with Mr. Yang, took a car directly to Mr. Yang's residence on Avenue Foch (now Yan'an West Road) for rest. The details of the situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Mission of This Trip</p>
<p>According to Mr. Qu, while on the ship, he told reporters that the purpose of this trip was originally to attend the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and to separately visit Chairman Chiang, President Wang, Minister of Finance Kong, and other central authorities to report on the financial situation of Guangdong Province and the situation of bandit suppression. However, upon arriving in Shanghai, he learned that the Fifth Plenary Session had already concluded and that Chairman Chiang had returned to his ancestral home in Fenghua to sweep the tombs. He plans to go to Beijing tonight or tomorrow night, and if time permits, he may also make a trip to Fenghua, as he is carrying two handwritten letters from Chairman Chen (Jitang) to Chairman Chiang and President Wang. As to the content, he cannot know since the letters are sealed.</p>
<p>Pursuing and Suppressing Remnant Bandits</p>
<p>Regarding the suppression of bandits, since the remnant bandits from Jiangxi Province fled to the border of Guangxi Province and the Second Group Army has been actively pursuing and suppressing them, the red bandits in the border areas of Guangxi and other provinces have been gradually cleared. Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have now decided to transfer troops from the two groups to form a pursuit force to pursue and suppress the scattered bandits. The organizational plan, etc., has been submitted to Chairman Chiang for review and instructions. In the near future, it will not be difficult to completely eliminate all the remnant bandits.</p>
<p>Denial of Seeking Loans</p>
<p>Mr. Qu continued, "The finances of Guangdong Province can usually balance income and expenditure, but during this period of bandit suppression, expenses have increased, resulting in a deficit. I do not know whether the central government has suspended the allocation of funds for bandit suppression in Guangdong Province. As for the rumors that Guangdong Province plans to establish large-scale steel plants and the Wengjiang Hydropower Plant for the Three-Year Construction Plan, and that the required funds of 50 million yuan will be borrowed from an American banking syndicate, which I will negotiate with the central government, are not true."</p>
<p>Hu and Wang Coming North</p>
<p>"Due to my hasty journey, I only met with Mr. Hu Zhantang once in Hong Kong, and the conversation time was very short. Whether Mr. Hu is coming north was not mentioned during the conversation. As for Mr. Wang Liangchou, he is still staying in Hong Kong, and I have not had time to meet with him, so I do not know when Mr. Wang will return north. However, according to another source, Mr. Wang is now scheduled to return north by ship from Hong Kong on the 19th."</p>
<p>Report to Kong</p>
<p>Mr. Qu had lunch at Yang Dezhao's residence yesterday noon. At 3:00 p.m., he went to Haig Road to visit Mayor Wu, and at 4:00 p.m., he left and went to Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi's residence on West Aihams Road to report on the financial situation of Guangdong Province and discuss ways to reorganize it. He left after talking for about an hour and then went to Song's residence to visit Song Ziwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the Economic Committee. He returned to Yang's residence for rest at about 6:00 p.m. Director of Customs Shen Yu hosted a banquet for Mr. Qu at his private residence at 7:00 p.m., and invited leaders from all walks of life in the city to accompany him. They dispersed happily at about 9:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Written Statement</p>
<p>Mr. Qu Fangpu, Central Committee Member and Guangdong Provincial Commissioner of Finance, made a statement to reporters upon arriving in Shanghai: "I, your brother, came to Beijing from Guangdong and arrived in Shanghai today (the 16th). Thank you, reporters, for inquiring about the general situation of Guangdong in recent years. Due to the rush of time, I was unable to provide a detailed account. I can only speak in general terms. All the facilities in Guangdong Province in the past two years have been earnestly implemented in accordance with the Three-Year Plan proposed by Chairman Chen Jitang. For the sake of convenience, I will divide it into two categories: military and political. (A) Regarding military affairs, it can be divided into pacification and bandit suppression and military construction. In terms of pacification, since the division of the five pacification zones, bandits have been suppressed. The good public security in the various districts in the past three years is unprecedented in the past thirty years. In addition to urging the stationed troops to be responsible for suppression, the pacification commissioners in each district have also vigorously implemented the Baojia system in each county to train local guards. Bandits have nowhere to hide among the people, and the people's armed forces have also been cultivated, which is enough to consolidate public security. The current budget for the guards in this province is about 9 million yuan. In terms of bandit suppression, from the autumn of the 20th year of the Republic of China to June of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the counties occupied by the Communist bandits in southern Jiangxi and western Fujian were successively recovered in more than a hundred battles, large and small. The power of the Communist bandits has been declining day by day. In mid-October of this year, the Communist bandits abandoned their old nest and fled westward. They were again severely attacked by our army. After more than four weeks of fierce fighting, dozens of battles, large and small, more than 10,000 bandits were killed, 4,000 to 5,000 guns were seized, and more than 1,000 people were captured. Although the remnant bandits have fled far away, there are still more than 50,000 remaining. If they invade Guizhou and Sichuan and open up international lines of money, the disaster will be even greater than if they were entrenched in a corner of Jiangxi Province. The military authorities of Guangdong and Guangxi have decided to transfer more than 20 regiments of troops to form a pursuit and suppression force to pursue and eliminate the remaining bandits. We must eliminate the remaining bandits before we are finished. An telegram has been sent to the central government for verification. (B) Regarding politics, it can be divided into civil administration, finance, construction, and education. In terms of civil administration, the important matters are: (1) To hold county magistrate examinations to select talented people to rectify officialdom. (2) To run political advanced training classes to cultivate talents with both political and military skills, and to appoint them as county mayors, bureau chiefs, or section chiefs. In the future, county magistrates and bureau chiefs and section chiefs under the county government must be trained, tested, and qualified before they can be appointed. (3) To promote local self-government. All levels of self-government organizations in this province have been completely organized. The county councils have been established one after another, and the provincial council was also established on August 15 this year. (4) To handle land administration, a training institute for land administration personnel was established. A total of more than 1,500 people have graduated. Currently, 40 survey teams have been organized and dispatched to various counties and cities to conduct land registration surveys. (5) To promote relief work, most of the relief homes and hospitals in various counties have been established on schedule. Unemployed overseas Chinese who return to the country are also accommodated. In the past two years, a total of more than 26,000 people have been accommodated, and they have been repatriated to their hometowns and found ways to make a living. In terms of finance, the most important points are: (1) To reorganize taxes. Since the thorough reorganization, the national and provincial treasury tax revenues have increased by more than 20 million yuan per year. However, because the amount of expenditure has increased sharply, the 22nd year can still be suitable, and the national and provincial treasury expenditures in the 23rd year are still short of more than 10 million yuan. In addition, the 5 million yuan budget for rural relief has not been included, and preparations are currently being made. (2) This province is actively carrying out the reform of the temporary land tax. All counties that have completed the investigation, sampling, evaluation, and completion of fields will change to the world land tax. Seven of the 94 counties in the province have implemented the reform of the temporary land tax, and 35 counties are in the process of bidding, 30 counties have not completed the sampling, and the remaining 32 counties are being urged to proceed. Soon, all counties will uniformly change to land tax, and the accumulated malpractice of grain and taxes can be swept away from now on. (3) To abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes, a total of more than 120 kinds of miscellaneous taxes have been abolished in the provincial treasury, with a total annual salary of more than 6.4 million yuan. In addition, there are 150 kinds of miscellaneous donations that have been abolished in various counties, totaling more than 170,000 yuan. A tax and fee investigation team is now organized to conduct a thorough investigation in various counties. After the investigation is completed, all the donations in various counties that are close to harshness will be completely abolished. In terms of construction, in the past two years, in terms of industry, in addition to continuing the unfinished work of the past, the projects that have been organized include silk weaving factories, hemp yarn factories, cotton yarn factories, wool weaving factories, and silk factories. The budgeted capital is 5,147,076 yuan in total. Sulphuric acid factories, caustic soda factories (ie soda factories), phosphate fertilizer factories, and light fertilizer factories, with a budgeted capital of 5,889,716 yuan in total. Beverage factories with a capital of 1,021,600 yuan, paper factories with a budgeted capital of more than 8,220,000 yuan, charcoal gas stove factories with a capital of 26,000 yuan, Xicun Cement Factory with a capital of more than 2,999,000 yuan, Xicun Cement Second Factory with a capital of more than 2,300,000 yuan, Panyu Sugar Factory with a capital of more than US$379,000, Chaozhou-Shantou Sugar Factory with a capital of more than US$377,000, Guangzhou Sugar Refinery with a capital of more than £158,300, and a construction cost of more than 530,000 yuan in silver. The Panyu Huizhou Sugar Factory has an alcohol factory and a soda factory with a capital of more than HK$430,000. All of the above factories have either been completed or are under construction. The remaining steel factory, Wengjiang Hydropower Plant, and shipyard are also under preparation. The steel factory is planned by the American Mackie Company and requires about 36 million yuan. According to statistics, the total capital budget for each factory is more than 93 million yuan, and more than 16 million yuan has been spent. There were originally 11 sugar factories planned to be established, and four factories have now been established first, and they will be added one after another in the future, because Guangdong is particularly suitable for planting sugarcane. (2) In terms of agriculture and mining, the Rural Bureau and the Sericulture Improvement Bureau have gradually carried out work in accordance with the regulations of the Three-Year Plan, actively promoting and establishing rice fields and improved sericulture experimental areas in order to increase production. Recently, a second silk reeling factory has been planned to improve silk reeling. In addition, rural relief has been given more than 1 million yuan in cash from the provincial treasury, and 5 million yuan has been allocated this year for the establishment of rural banks in various districts to revitalize water conservancy and farmer loans. As for mining, coal mines, gold mines, and copper mines in various districts have been started to be mined. Tungsten mines are also produced in large quantities in this province. Since they were brought under government control, their value has increased significantly. The above only refers to those operated by the government, and the private ones have not been described in detail. The provincial government has clearly defined the measures to protect and reward private enterprises, and established a committee to be in charge of the matter. (3) In terms of transportation and highways, this province plans to build three railway lines, one is the Jiangqin Road, from Jiangmen to Qin County, one is the Sanhe Road, from Sanshui to He County in Guangxi, and the other is the Guangshan Road, from Guangzhou to Shantou. Preparations are now underway to build them. The highway network in this province has been completed. The provincial, county, and township roads that have been built total more than 18,900 li. All the completed roads have been opened to traffic. In addition, the Southwest Airlines has been established for a year, from Guangzhou to Wuzhou, Nanning, and Longzhou in Guangxi, from Guangzhou to Gaozhou and Leizhou, and the two routes from Beihai to Nanning have long been open to navigation, making transportation convenient. In terms of education, in terms of school education, there are a total of 23,700 primary schools in the province, with a total of 1,252,500 primary school students, a total of 265 middle schools, with a total of 56,100 students, a total of 56 normal schools, with a total of 8,400 students, a total of 41 vocational schools, with a total of more than 3,000 students, and a total of 7 colleges and universities, with a total of more than 4,500 students. In terms of social education, in the provincial capital, there are one each of the Mass Education Center, Sports Committee, Sports Experimental Area, and Social Education Experimental Area. There are more than 40 Mass Education Centers in various counties and cities, 644 Mass Literacy Centers, 479 Mass Reading Rooms, more than 10,000 Popular Lecture Halls, more than 100 libraries, 76 public sports grounds, and 83 parks. In terms of education funding, they have been increasing year by year. In the 23rd year, excluding the education funding required for the implementation of the Three-Year Plan, the budget expenditure is more than 4 million yuan, which is more than twice that of the 19th year. This refers to the allocation from the provincial treasury. The education funding for each county and city is about 13 million yuan per year, and Guangzhou City alone is more than 2.3 million yuan per year. In terms of military education, since the second semester of the 20th year, all students above the secondary school level should receive military education. The first class was before the 21st year, with a total of more than 7,700 trainees. The 23rd year is the second class, with a total of more than 8,800 trainees. In addition, the general situation of the National Secondary School, University, and Provincial Xiangqin University in this province is also briefly discussed. Sun Yat-sen University is actively expanding the new school built in Shipai. The first phase has been completed with 28 units, and the construction cost is more than 2 million yuan. The three colleges of law, agriculture, and engineering will be moved into the new school this year. The construction cost of the second phase is also about 2 million yuan, and it can be completed next autumn. If the various projects in the third phase can be completed as soon as possible, the university facilities commemorating the Premier can be completed. The newly established Xiangqin University will transform the original Japanese Industrial College and the Municipal Normal School into two colleges. The Normal School will also add a College of Commerce. The address has been selected and the new school is being built, which can be completed next autumn. The start-up fee is more than 2.22 million yuan, which will be allocated in installments, and the annual recurring fee is more than 819,000 yuan, which will be allocated separately by the provincial and municipal governments. The above is the more important of the recent facilities in Guangdong, and the rest will not be described in detail."</p>

<p>On the 13th, thirteen private postal bureaus in the city dispatched general representatives Hua Yunjin, Yin Yuantong, and others to Beijing to join the representatives of the National Private Postal Bureaus in Beijing and jointly petition the central government departments and the Fifth Plenary Session, requesting a five-year extension of the closure. Now that the matter is completed, they have returned to Shanghai and reported the process to the meeting yesterday morning, and sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang to appeal. The reporter from the China East News Agency specially asked Mr. Yin Yuantong yesterday, and according to the conversation, the details of the petition are as follows:</p>
<p>National Representatives Enthusiastically Go to Beijing</p>
<p>According to Mr. Yin, the private postal bureaus are concerned about the impact on their livelihoods after the closure, so they went to the capital to jointly petition. The seven of us were representatives of the 49 private postal bureaus in Shanghai City and went to Beijing by night train on the 13th. On that day, when the train passed through Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and other ports, representatives boarded the train to connect and go to Beijing. The next morning at 8:00, they arrived at the Xiaguan Station in the capital. At that time, there were representatives waiting at the station from Hong Kong, Hankou, Changsha, Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Fenghua, Yuyao, Shangyu, Xiaoshan, Pinghu, Zhenhai, Xiashi, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Fengjing, Songjiang, Taizhou, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Linhuai Pass, Bengbu, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Guangming, Zhangbaling, Xuzhou, and Wuyi, a total of 110 general representatives from 162 counties in various provinces across the country, which was very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Party and Government Agencies All Agreed to Find a Way</p>
<p>In the morning, we originally planned to enter the city to petition, but because the representatives of Gaozi, Gaoyou, Yangzhou, Shaobo, Xiannvmiao, and other counties had not yet gathered, we waited until 2:00 p.m. After the representatives from all ports across the country arrived, we took a car to enter the city and first petitioned the Central Party Headquarters and the Fifth Plenary Session. Committee Member Ni received us and explained the significance of coming to Beijing to petition. He agreed to find a way to help, and we left. We then went to the National Government Executive Yuan, etc. The National Government was received by Zhang Yaode, a representative of the civil service, and the Executive Yuan was received by Secretary Di Ying. The Ministry of Transportation was in the process of moving, so it only received a petition. As for the response from the National Government Executive Yuan, it was very concerned and agreed to find a way to help and instructed us to continue business with peace of mind. Even if it ends at the end of the year, there will be proper arrangements for the livelihoods of more than 100,000 unemployed employees, and it will never be enforced without considering the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Shanghai Representatives Returned to Shanghai the Night Before Last</p>
<p>Mr. Yin continued, "We originally planned to return to Shanghai by night train the day before yesterday, but the Ministry of Interior said that there was not enough time and we had not yet petitioned, so we delayed for a day. Yesterday morning, we went to the Ministry of Interior, and Section Chief Chen received us. He also agreed to convey our intentions to the Minister. Looking at the overall results of this trip to the capital, the petition was quite satisfactory, and the representatives from all over the country also felt satisfied, so they have all returned to their respective places. We, a group of eleven people, took the 5:00 p.m. train to Shanghai."</p>
<p>Meeting Held Again at 9:00 Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>After Yin Yuantong and others returned to Shanghai, they convened a meeting of the city's private postal industry at the Civil Postal Industry Association on Xiangxian Gua Street at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, with more than 20 representatives from private postal bureaus such as Nanshi Quansheng, Furun Song, Xinggong, Risheng Sheng, Senchang, Yuxingfu, Yuxingkang, Renchang, Taigujin, Zhengdayuan, Zhenghe Xie, and Zhengda. Yin Yuantong presided over the meeting. During the meeting, Yin reported on the process of petitioning in Beijing, and then discussed the continuation of business and response measures, etc. The meeting ended at 11:00 a.m.</p>
<p>There are Indeed a Thousand National Private Postal Bureaus</p>
<p>Hua Yunjin told a reporter from the China East News Agency that it was reported on the 14th that there are a total of 386 private postal bureaus nationwide that have registered with the post office, and that 23 have voluntarily closed down, with only a thousand employees, which is unfounded. According to the statistics of the Civil Postal Industry Association, there are indeed more than a thousand private postal bureaus in the twelve provinces across the country that have registered with the post office and those that have not registered. This is only three-tenths of those who have registered with the post office. I don't know that there are still seven-tenths who have not registered. Moreover, in many rural towns and villages, not only are there no post offices, but there are no mailboxes. However, there is a private postal bureau in every small village.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Buying Large Quantities of Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Successively Over Five Million Stone</p>
<p>This year, due to drought in various parts of our country and poor grain production, rice merchants in Shanghai have been ordering foreign rice from Siam, Yangon, and Saigon. More than three million bags have been ordered, each bag containing 1 stone and 6 dou, totaling about five million stone. 800,000 bags arrived this year, and the rest are futures for next year. The Min Party produced a lot of rice this year. In order to prevent the shortage of goods, Shanghai rice merchants ordered 15,000 tons of January futures at a price of 4 yuan and 85 cents. The quality of the goods is better than that of Saigon rice, and the price is also cheaper. It can be used as japonica rice. Recently, due to the large purchases of foreign rice by rice merchants, the market price has also been slightly lower.</p>

<p>Municipal Government Approves Notification from Public Works Department, Urging Residents Not to Be Alarmed</p>
<p>The Public Concession International Volunteer Corps conducted a defensive exercise yesterday morning, divided into three major areas: West, Central, and North. The Western District simulated a bandit attack on the Special District. The exercise lasted from 8:00 AM to 12:30 PM. Members of various circles, both Chinese and foreign, were invited to observe, and a banquet was held for fellowship. The detailed report is as follows:</p>

The Western District was commanded by An'taisi, the Central District by Lei Tuo, and the Northern District by Yi Weinoufu.</p>
<p>Concentrated Mobilization</p>
<p>The Volunteer Corps assumed that on the night of the 14th, a large number of bandits were discovered in Huangdu, Sijing, Minhang, and other areas in the western suburbs of the Special District, engaging in arson, looting, and robbery, causing a state of chaos. Upon receiving the report, the headquarters conducted reconnaissance at 3:00 AM yesterday morning and confirmed that the bandits were indeed advancing towards the Special District. The number of bandits was unclear, but their combat power was very strong, and they possessed machine guns and rifles. However, their organization was scattered, and they lacked a good leader. The headquarters immediately issued an order to prepare and concentrate at the Public Works Department of the Public Concession on Hankou Road and at the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>Defense Completed</p>
<p>At 6:30 AM yesterday morning, Colonel Gray Ting, the commander-in-chief, issued a mobilization order. Consequently, the entire force set off, and all armored vehicles, light artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and machine gun teams concentrated at the designated area battalion headquarters. Then, the commanders of each battalion headquarters issued orders to implement defense at the designated locations. By 8:00 AM, defense of all districts was completed. When departing, the China General Omnibus Company of the Public Concession dispatched a large number of buses as transportation vehicles.</p>
<p>Western District Situation</p>
<p>The Western District had one battalion, commanded by An'taisi, divided into three teams: cavalry, light artillery, and infantry. Members of the Chinese team participated in the infantry team, with four platoons. The locations for guard duty were: the first platoon from Suzhou Creek to Baoli'nan Road, the second platoon from Baoli'nan Road to Dunxin Road, the third platoon from Dunxin Road to Great Western Road, conducting defensive patrols and guarding. The fourth platoon was a reserve team, stationed at the Chinese team headquarters, responsible for rear area searches and guarding the Suzhou Creek area. The cavalry and light artillery teams were on alert along Kaixuan Road, Fahua Road, Hualun Road, Dunxin Road, Great Western Road, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line. The alert signal was a "red light flare."</p>

<p>The Central District also stationed one battalion, commanded by Lei Tuo, divided into machine gun, anti-aircraft gun, and infantry teams. Each team was divided into A, B, C, and D platoons. Machine gun teams and infantry were stationed at Waibaidu Bridge, Zhabu Road Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, Tianhou Temple Bridge, Pentang Lane Bridge, Laozha Bridge, Garbage Bridge, Xizang Road Bridge, North Xizang Road, North Zhejiang Road, and North Henan Road. The Henan Road battalion headquarters stationed a reserve team of 117 people, responsible for patrol and guard duties. However, no Chinese or Japanese teams joined the Central District members.</p>
<p>Northern District Situation</p>
<p>The Northern District had one battalion, commanded by Yi Weinoufu, divided into armored vehicle, light artillery, and infantry teams. Members of the Japanese team joined the infantry team. Infantry and machine guns were stationed at Yuezhou Road, Linping Road, Chudi Siwei Road, Outer Hongqiao, Inner Hongqiao, Jiaxing Road Bridge, and Oujia Road Bridge. The East Broadway Road battalion headquarters stationed a reserve team, responsible for patrol work. Armored vehicle teams number six and seven, staffed by Russian team members, were responsible for patrolling the defense area.</p>
<p>Ended at Noon</p>
<p>The engineering, transportation, and traffic teams, totaling one battalion, were dedicated to construction, transportation, and traffic matters in the three major areas: West, Central, and North. The defense status of each district and the actions of the bandits were reported to the battalion headquarters of the respective district and relayed to the general headquarters via telephone. Many citizens observed the exercise. By 12:30 PM, it was assumed that the bandits had been defeated and had no combat capability. The commander-in-chief then ordered a halt, and the teams withdrew.</p>
<p>British Military Evaluation</p>
<p>When the International Volunteer Corps held its defensive exercise yesterday morning, officers from the British garrison in Shanghai served as judges. After the general mobilization of the Volunteer Corps, the British military officers serving as judges traveled by car to the three major areas: West, Central, and North, to inspect the defense status of each team in order to make their evaluations. It was reported that the deployment and actions of the Volunteer Corps members in each district were very rapid and agile, which was admirable.</p>
<p>Invited Observers</p>
<p>During the exercise yesterday morning, the Volunteer Corps also invited officers from various countries to observe. From China, Qi Xueqi, the second regiment commander of the municipal security force, and Ruan Kaiji and Tan Baoshou, inspectors of the municipal police bureau, and supervising police officer Yang Hairong attended.

<h3>American Woman Smith Returns to Shanghai by Car from Changsha</h3>
<p>Entire Journey: 781 Miles</p>
<p>Actual Driving Time: 30 Hours</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that Ms. Smith, the American Commercial Attaché stationed in Shanghai, returned to the city by car from Changsha yesterday (the 15th) at 7:20 PM. Ms. Smith should be considered the first woman in the history of modern China to have driven a car from Shanghai to Changsha and then driven back from there. Accompanying her was Fischer of Tianjin, who speaks various dialects and is skilled in driving. Ms. Smith left Shanghai by car ten days ago and arrived in Changsha on Wednesday (the 12th). The next day, she returned to Shanghai from Changsha and arrived safely in the city yesterday. The entire journey was 781 miles, and the actual driving time was 30 hours. Ms. Smith told a reporter from the Continental News yesterday that the roads in Hunan Province are very good, and the roads in Jiangxi Province are also well-built. In several places, she was able to reach a speed of 40 miles per hour, but there were also uneven sections in the middle where she could not drive fast. She was very surprised by the good scenery of the roads and countryside in Jiangxi Province. She initially thought that they must have been abandoned, but the condition of the farmers was better than that of the farmers in many places in the north, and the traffic on the roads was also busy. She saw long-distance buses and engineers from Shanghai going there to work on road construction. Nanchang is now vibrant, reminding her of the situation in Nanjing in 1928. She saw many people building new streets 120 to 100 feet wide, and several places were paved with cement. Throughout the trip, she received courtesy and cooperation. She believes that anyone who wants to make this trip can have the same experience as her if they have adequate preparation and obtain the proper permits. Gasoline and other supplies are also available everywhere. Ms. Smith drove for nine days on this trip and felt very tired, but she claims that she plans to continue making long-distance car trips. Next time, she may drive to Chengdu or Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Records of Contemporary People's Movements</h3>
<p>Tang Youren, Ye Chucang, Wu Zhihui, and Zhang Jingjiang left Beijing by express train at 8:00 AM yesterday morning and arrived in Shanghai at 2:30 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhiben, Cui Guangxiu, Guan Suren, Li Qi'an, and Chu Minyi left Beijing by night express train yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Urgent Progress on the Guantai Damming Project, Jiugu Road Immediately Rush to Complete Closing</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangrong, Commissioner of the Yellow River Flood Relief Association and Director of the Labor Relief Group, considering the sudden changes in weather and rising temperatures, and deeply concerned that construction would be difficult once freezing occurred, was extremely anxious. He specifically telegraphed both the Guantai and Jiugu Road construction sites to provide detailed reports on the original length of the breaches, the length already dammed, and the remaining length, in order to schedule the completion date. He also dispatched additional inspectors to supervise the work and ensure that it was completed according to the deadline agreed upon with the River Bureau employees in the northern section earlier, completely damming all breaches before the Lunar New Year. According to a telegram report from Hua Deming, Director of the Hebei River Bureau, received by the Labor Relief Group: (1) For the Guantai damming project, the brushwood dam on the west end is now 189.6 meters long, with a water depth of 3 meters, a water drop of 6 centimeters, and a relatively stable water flow. The east end is 361.6 meters long, and the back revetment is 361.6 meters long. (2) For the Jiugu Road project, the west dam's entire gate foundation is stable, and the back revetment is also neatly erected. The east dam's foundation, due to the original willow dam being broken by the water, had its bell wires, willow piles, and brick dragons all submerged at the bottom of the water. The current advance cannot avoid these obstacles, resulting in leaks and trickles at the bottom of the foundation, which are most undesirable for damming. Fortunately, hemp sacks of earth were used to block the leaks, and the foundation was compressed and strengthened with heavy waist ropes. Only at night did it appear solid. The flow of water at the breach suddenly became heavier, directly hitting the front of the east dam, with scattered and circulating currents also impacting the back revetment. The revetment earth that had been erected in the past two days was extremely difficult to advance due to the deep and swift water. Later, a spur dike was added north of the back revetment to defend against the circulating currents, and earthwork foremen were strictly ordered to recruit more laborers and pay cash wages to ensure continuous progress day and night. Preparations are being made to advance the construction of the east dam's golden gate foundation tomorrow, and nine river soldiers are being transferred from the northern third section and the river soldiers who were building the bridge are being recalled to work together to rush the project. Once the gate foundations are completely built and stabilized, the closing will be rushed to completion.</p>
<h3>Zhang Deshu, Founder of the Xi'an National Products Company, Comes to Shanghai to Purchase National Products</h3>
<p>The Shenshi News Agency reported that Zhang Deshu, the founder of the Xi'an National Products Company, arrived here from Xi'an yesterday. A reporter from the Shenshi News Agency visited him and had the following conversation:</p>
<p>Establishing a National Products Company</p>
<p>According to Zhang, foreign and inferior goods flood the markets in the Northwest. Since the Northwest Mobile National Products Exhibition was held, the general public has a considerable understanding of national products. However, because inferior goods are disguised as national products, it is difficult for the public to distinguish them. Therefore, he and the local business community established the Xi'an National Products Company to collect various goods for people to buy. He came here to purchase goods to be transported to Xi'an for display. The company's location and staff have been arranged, and the opening is expected soon.</p>
<p>Optimistic About the Future of National Products</p>
<p>All sectors of Xi'an are now working hard to promote national products, so progress has gradually been made. After the opening of this national products company, it is expected that people will be happy to purchase its products, so the future is quite optimistic. It is said that the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association will hold a national products exhibition in Lanzhou, Gansu. In the future, the national products movement in the Northwest will definitely be very prosperous.</p>
<h3>The December Issue of the Shen Bao Monthly is Published</h3>

<h3>Clearing Accounts and Preparing to Resume Business</h3>
<p>Warning to General Manager Ou Jiancheng</p>
<p>To Come Forward and Take Responsibility as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reported that the Yong'an Silver Company, after temporarily suspending business for seven days starting on the 12th of this month, the board of directors warned General Manager Ou Jiancheng and is preparing to resume business. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Warning to the Manager: Honorary Chairman Li Du, Chairman Deng Jinghuan, and Vice Chairman Jia Zhen, among others, entrusted lawyer Jiang Yiping and others to notify and thoroughly investigate General Manager Ou Jiancheng, stating that they were invited by Mr. Ou Jiancheng to serve as chairman and directors of the Yong'an Silver Company, but due to their political positions, they were unable to understand the circumstances of Mr. Ou's handling of all matters of the company. On the 11th of this month, they suddenly heard the news that the Yong'an Silver Company had suspended business and that Mr. Ou had fled. They rushed to inquire, but most of the directors were also unaware of the situation. It is unreasonable for a financial institution that has been in operation for less than 100 days to be forced to suspend business and hide away. Therefore, they have specifically entrusted someone to conduct a thorough investigation to clarify the situation, so as to avoid being framed and burdened by him. They have also requested that Mr. Ou be warned to come forward and take responsibility as soon as possible, otherwise, please ask your lawyer to represent them and, if necessary, take all civil and criminal legal proceedings. In addition to accepting the commission in accordance with the law, we are jointly publishing the above announcement in the newspaper. We hope that the manager will come forward immediately to take responsibility and avoid self-destruction, leading to criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>Clearing Accounts: Lawyer Jiang Yiping, accountant Jiang Wanping, and others, entrusted by the board of directors, notified all interested parties, stating that the company has been in operation for only three months. Considering the circumstances, even if there have been losses, they should not be significant. Unexpectedly, General Manager Ou Jiancheng suddenly fled, plunging the company into a state of suspension. Many directors are scattered in all directions due to important business and rushed to gather, but are at a loss. Knowing that accountant Jiang and lawyer Jiang have been entrusted by Chairman Deng and others to conduct a thorough investigation of the content of the accounts, all members of the board have the same mind and have jointly decided to entrust your accountant and your lawyer to represent the board in safekeeping and clearing all account books and documents. Please notify all interested creditors to report the amount of their claims for verification and registration of the amount to see if it matches. All debtors should immediately send the full amount of their debts to your accountant for safekeeping. All promissory notes should also be returned to their original roots for verification and registration, so as to ensure that accurate account statements are calculated as soon as possible and handled properly in accordance with the law. We accept the commission in accordance with the law and hereby issue the announcement for your information and compliance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Sergeant Dies After Falling from Building While Intoxicated</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun, a first-class sergeant stayed at the Inoue Inn, a naval designated hotel on Laobazi Road, at 11:30 PM on the 15th. He appeared to be drunk, so he was taken to a room on the fourth floor to sleep. At 1:00 AM on the 16th, a rickshaw puller was disturbing outside. The innkeeper heard the noise and got up, and suddenly saw a half-submerged figure in the fountain in the front yard. Upon closer inspection, he saw a corpse with a four-inch-wide laceration on its forehead, who was the sergeant who had stayed at the inn that night. He immediately reported to the Marine Corps patrol team, who, together with officers from the Public Works Department's Hongkou Office, rushed to the scene. The sergeant was named Kawahata Ryo, a crew member belonging to the Wu Naval Port. After investigation, it was determined that he died tragically after falling from the building while intoxicated.</p>

<h3>Arguing Over Rice Gruel and Side Dishes, Using Scissors to Stab Someone to Death</h3>
<p>Chen Jianfu Dies Tragically En Route</p>
<p>Chen Jianfu, 21 years old, a Ningbo native and employee of the Rongchangxiang Western Clothing Store at No. 174 Yongji Lane, Tangshan Road, Hongkou, had an argument with another employee named Zhou Huibao over the rice gruel and side dishes at breakfast yesterday morning around 8:00 AM. Neither would give way. Zhou Huibao, unable to win the argument, became angry and resorted to violence. During the struggle, Zhou saw a pair of sharp scissors on the table and threw them at Chen. Unexpectedly, the scissors landed right in Chen's waist, piercing deeply inside. Chen fell to the ground in extreme pain, bleeding profusely. Other employees of the store, seeing the great disaster that had occurred, quickly dissuaded Zhou. They immediately reported to the police and dispatched a car to rush Chen to the hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died en route. The corpse was then transferred to the coroner's office to await examination this morning. Zhou was arrested and will be sent to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Thorough Search Yields Seven Thieves</h3>
<p>Numerous Crimes</p>
<p>Sent for Investigation and Handling</p>
<p>Li Jing, the director of the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, stated that because robberies have occurred frequently in the Nanshi area during the current winter prevention period, he has strictly ordered Shen Wenda, the leader of the detective team stationed at the bureau, and Deputy Leader Fang Lingen to conduct a thorough investigation. After the detective team leader received the order, he purchased informants and conducted a covert investigation. On the morning of the 12th of this month, around 4:00 AM, confidential information was received from an informant that several thieves were planning to rob Nanshi, including the thieves Zhou Xuewei, Zhou Fuquan, and Tang Xuelian, who were hiding in the Xietu Road area of Nanshi. After Shen, the team leader, received the report, he reported separately to Li, the director of the branch, and Lu Ying, the captain of the detective team. He then led Deputy Leader Fang Lingen, detectives Bian Wenguang, Zheng Yongxiang, and Jiao Baojun, among others, disguised, to the second poorest residence at No. 252 Xietu Road, where they arrested Zhou Xuewei. After interrogation, he confessed that Ma Yimei, who lived on the upper floor of No. 16 Kangti Road in the French Concession, had the handgun, which he obtained from Tang Xuelian. After the confession, Deputy Team Leader Fang Lingen was immediately dispatched, leading detectives Yang Jisheng, Bian Wenguang, and Qiu Shuxian, among others, to the French Concession, where they, together with French constable No. 21, West Detective Li Axin, and Chinese detectives, went to No. 16 Kangti Road to arrest Ma Yimei, but she was not found (the thief had already fled upon hearing the news). Meanwhile, Deputy Team Leader Fang Lingen, along with detectives Bian Wenguang and Jiao Baojun, among others, and the suspect Zhou, were en route to Zhizaoju Road when they encountered the thief Tang Xuelian and the suspect Tao Shugao. They were taken to the bureau for interrogation. Later, they went to No. 4 Yuqing Lane, Lingjiazhai, on the same road, where they arrested the thieves Zhou Fuquan, Gao Dehua, and Zheng Zhangshi. They also found five handgun bullets on Zheng Zhangshi, as well as stolen clothing, red velvet, printed quilt covers, and velvet-lined women's trousers that were robbed from the Mo family in Ziyang Lane at the Jiaodaoqiao Road intersection. All were taken to the bureau for interrogation. Gao Dehua confessed that he, together with Gu Laosan, Zhou Fuquan, and Sun Fengshan (also known as Sun Dakuaitou), among others, robbed the Wen Qing family's clothing and silver dollars from the Yuanda Nanhua Store at No. 68 Dapu Road, for which he received five strings of cash. He also robbed the Mo family at No. 8 Ziyang Lane, Jiaodaoqiao Road, of diamond rings, gold and silver fox fur women's coats, and other items, for which he received seven yuan in foreign currency. Zhou Fuquan also confessed that he, together with Gu Laosan, Sun Fengshan, Zhou Xuewei, and Gao Dehua, among others, robbed the Mo family at Jiaodaoqiao Road, for which he received ten yuan in foreign currency. He also robbed the Zhuang Wenqing family at the Yuanda Nanhua Store at No. 68 Dapu Road, for which he also received ten yuan in silver dollars. Zheng Zhangshi confessed that she had an affair with Gao Dehua, and that when she saw the detectives coming to arrest them, Zhou Fuquan had put the handgun bullets on her. Tang Xuelian confessed that Xia Laoyang and Xiao Wangzi lived with him, and that one night they said they would take a handgun and rob the Yanzhi Store on Xiexu Road, obtaining several thousand copper coins. There were seven thousand copper coins at his house. He also said that He San and Xia Lao took a handgun to rob the Shunxing Beef Store on Xietu Road. The suspect Tao Shugao confessed that he was a tea servant at the Yanping Tea House and did not know them. "If you don't believe me, please inquire," he said. After interrogating the thieves, Deputy Team Leader Fang Lingen, Bian Wenguang, Zheng Yongxiang, and Liu Wenhui, among others, led the suspect Gao to No. 12 Chenjiahang Road, Yangjiadu, Pudong, where they pointed out Wu Yuanshi, who was arrested. Zheng Zhangshi confessed that she did not know Wu Yuanshi. Once, she led Zhou Fuquan to her house, and he and her husband wanted to borrow five yuan in foreign currency, but they were refused, so she held a grudge and falsely accused her. Later, the detectives seized the stolen goods from the Hongmao Pawnshop, Baohe Pawnshop, and Guangda Pawnshop and brought them to the bureau. In addition to strictly arresting the fugitives Xia Laoyang, Gu Laosan, Sun Fengshan, Sun Da, Wang Erma Yimei, etc., and sending them for handling, the thieves who were apprehended were briefly interrogated by Director Li of the branch, and the thieves Zhou Xuewei, Gao Dehua, Zhou Fuquan, Tang Xuelian, Zheng Zhangshi, and the suspects Tao Shugao and Wu Yuanshi were all prepared with documents and sent to the headquarters for interrogation. The thieves sent included Zhou Xuewei, 35 years old, from Funing; Tang Xuelian, 31 years old, from Funing; Zhou Fuquan, 36 years old, from Funing; Gao Dehua, 38 years old, from Yangzhou; Zheng Zhangshi, 42 years old, from Yangzhou; the suspect Tao Shugao, 31 years old, from Zhenjiang; and Wu Yuanshi, 25 years old, from Taizhou.</p>

It is reported that the authorities have designated next year as the Student National Products Year, and it is hoped that students in general will vigorously promote domestic products, so that the future of industry can be developed.</p>
<h3>A Copper Coin Murder Case</h3>
<p>The Two Murderers Continue to be Interrogated</p>
<p>Final Arguments Concluded, Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>Gao Anjun, a Shandong native residing at No. 183 Rue Lartigue in the French Concession, is 42 years old this year. He previously served as Patrolman No. 78 in the French Police Department. After resigning due to failing an eye test, he remained unemployed. Around September 10th of this year, Gao was idly chatting at Cheng Shuntai Tobacco and Paper Shop at No. 232 Rue Gansidong in the French Concession. It happened that a rogue named Wang Axiong went to the shop to exchange a two-dime coin, and a dispute arose over one missing copper coin. Gao intervened and slapped Wang in the face, driving him away. However, Wang harbored resentment. On the 17th of the same month, he gathered a gang to seek revenge. He encountered Gao in front of Xin Shangtai Meat Shop at No. 85 Rue Remy and shot Gao to death. After investigation by the French Police Department, the murderers had all fled. On October 11th, someone suddenly threatened Cheng Shuntai Tobacco and Paper Shop, extorting a thousand gold pieces in an attempt to settle the matter. The deceased's family, through the shop, reported to the French Police Department, which found that the accomplices of the murderer, Wang Liansheng, also known as Wang Daodao and Lian Geng, had fled to Hankou and recently returned to Shanghai, hiding in Room 9 of the Oriental Hotel on Sanma Road. They sent people to Cheng Shuntai to extort money. The detectives arrested Wang and Shao and sent them to the Second Special Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution on charges of murder and intimidation. Gao Hu, the widow of the deceased, also hired a lawyer to file an incidental private prosecution, seeking compensation for damages. Wang and Shao, the two defendants, confessed that they were instigated by Wang Zhong and Mao Jusheng, who were on the run, and that they themselves did not participate. They hired lawyers Zheng Sen and Wang Shizong to defend them. This was reported in previous newspapers. Judge Cao Jun, who was hearing the case, believing that the case involved a serious crime of homicide, did not spare any effort to seek details. After repeatedly summoning witnesses and ordering the two defendants to appear in court for questioning without a conclusion, the Fifth Court was opened again to summon witnesses from all parties. After a detailed examination of the defendants, he ordered the debate to begin. The court declared the debate closed and awaited a scheduled verdict. The defendants were still held in custody pending instructions.</p>
<h3>Thugs Break into Dancer's Home at Midnight</h3>
<p>Claiming to be Police Detectives</p>
<p>Beating and Injuring the Dancer and Her Father</p>
<p>Jiang Yuying, also known as Gendi, a dancer at the Metropolitan Dance Hall, is 24 years old and from Siyang, Jiangbei. She lives with her father, Jiang Peijin, in a small room at No. 67 Guangxi Road. Around 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, Zhang Guanghua from Changzhou and Jiang Shanli from Danyang broke into Jiang's room and looked around. When the woman asked what was going on, Zhang replied that they were looking for someone surnamed Wang. The woman told them that there was no one with the surname Wang there. Zhang and Jiang left immediately. Unexpectedly, at 1:30 a.m. that night, Zhang and Jiang suddenly returned, making a great commotion. Zhang claimed to be a police detective, and Jiang claimed to be a detective partner. They said they were there to arrest Jiang Yuying's lover, a Mr. Yu, because Yu, who worked at Wang Yutai Tea Shop, had recently embezzled funds and fled without a trace. They had learned that he was hiding here, so they came to arrest him. Jiang immediately replied that Yu did not come here. Zhang punched and kicked the woman. Jiang Peijin, the woman's father, stepped forward to reason with them and was also punched by Zhang, losing a tooth. Both father and daughter were injured. The cohabitant reported to Detective Yang Guanying and Chinese Constable No. 2516, who arrested Zhang and Jiang and took them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the situation and filed charges under Article 293 of the Criminal Code for assault, Article 320 for obstruction of freedom, and Article 165 for impersonating public officials. He also stated that the police department was still investigating the case and requested a postponement for further interrogation. Subsequently, Jiang Yuying and her father submitted a complaint detailing the situation. When questioned, both defendants confessed to going to find Yu, but had no other intentions, denying that they had assaulted the plaintiffs. Judge Yinghua examined the confessions and ordered that the case be postponed for one week for further interrogation. The two defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Private Car Drives into River Embankment on Shanghai-Taicang Road</h3>
<p>Four Men Seriously Injured and Bleeding</p>
<p>Zhong Wenlong and Zhong Wenbiao, brothers residing next to the Dachang Bus Station in Baoshan County, along with their families and a friend surnamed Gu, and a driver named Aqiao, a total of five people, were traveling in their private car yesterday at 3:45 p.m. The car had concession license number 3366 and Chinese license number 7743. They were driving from Shanghai back to Dachang. When they reached about one li north of Pengpu Station, the car suddenly veered north and drove straight into the river embankment beside the road. Fortunately, the riverbed was dry. The front of the car crashed head-on into a small poplar tree on the riverbank. The driver, Aqiao, first crashed his head and face into the thick glass windshield in front. With a "crash," his head broke through the window. At this time, the driver's nose had disappeared. The other three men were also injured in the same way. A woman was fortunate to fall on top of the men and did not bleed, but everyone was in a coma and unaware of what was happening. Blood was splattered throughout the car. Later, another car passed by and immediately took the injured people to Yiqingqiao Huilu Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital nearby for treatment and bandaging. At the same time, they telephoned the Shanghai-Taicang Bus Station and summoned a Xiang Sheng car to take the injured people to the Huilu Hospital main branch on Avenue Edward VII. Due to the severity of the injuries, they were transferred to Nanyang Hospital. The items in the car were smashed to pieces. The Pengpu Town Police Station of the Xinzha Branch also dispatched two police officers on bicycles after hearing the report, confirming the incident and reporting it to the branch. Currently, the wrecked vehicle remains in the river embankment. In the evening, reporters drove to the scene to view it, and saw blood splattered inside the car and along the roadside, a terrible sight to behold.</p>
<h3>Zhenru Guan Sheng Farm's Spring Flowers are Now Blooming</h3>
<p>Awarded Special Prize at City Horticultural Exhibition</p>
<p>Zhenru Guan Sheng Farm in western Shanghai was founded in 1921 by Chen Gunsheng, a horticultural expert who studied in Japan, with his own investment. It covers an area of more than 80 mu and has more than 20 greenhouses. It is the largest and most rational seedling organization in our country. It has been operating for more than ten years, collecting thousands of varieties of horticultural species from home and abroad, and managing and cultivating them using scientific methods. Therefore, all its products are completely different from those of other farms. A reporter from the Dagong News visited the farm the day before yesterday to see various exotic flowers and plants, which were beautiful. Spring flowers are made to bloom in winter. According to Mr. Chen, early-maturing varieties are used and accelerated cultivation methods are employed to make them bloom at this time. It can be said to be a feat of skillful workmanship. It is also learned that the farm has a complete organization, with division of labor and cooperation. The landscaping department is the main body, and the flower department is the subsidiary. The flower production is already amazing, with a net income of more than 20 yuan per day. The landscaping department drafts for others or contracts to build parks and gardens. All the materials needed for the layout are supplied by the farm itself and are not purchased from other places, which can be said to be a characteristic of the farm. At the first art exhibition held by the municipal government this time, the farm's succulent plants, which are rare in the world, were examined by experts and given a special prize, which can be said to be rare and valuable.</p>
<h3>Zhou Guansan's Family Dispute Adjourned</h3>
<p>Zhou Relates the Truth of His Wife's Ferocity</p>
<p>Saying He Suffered Both Mental and Physical Pain</p>
<p>丨Sentencing Scheduled for the 21st of This Month丨</p>
<p>Zhou Guansan, a 36-year-old Hangzhou native currently the manager of the Far East Aircraft Company on Yuanmingyuan Road, was involved in the Jesus Christ movement and held a position in the Hangzhou Youth Association. This was ten years ago. At that time, he met a female colleague and fellow believer named Wang Yuqing (now 39 years old). The two became acquainted and their friendship developed into love. In 1921, they were formally married through introductions and a wedding ceremony. Unexpectedly, Wang Yuqing had an extremely fierce personality, and disagreements between the couple arose, causing frequent storms. For example, Wang hired a lawyer to draw up agreements and various forms of coercion occurred frequently. In recent years, Wang's treatment of Zhou has become even more violent. On July 3 of this year, Wang forced Zhou to sign a divorce agreement at a lawyer's office, but Zhou escaped midway and the matter was not completed. Zhou has since been living at the Baxianqiao Youth Association, where he boards and lodges. Seeing that her plan had failed, Wang commissioned a lawyer to file a complaint with the First Court of the Special District, accusing Zhou of doting on concubines and abusing his wife, assaulting her, and abandoning her, requesting a ruling for cohabitation and alimony. Her request for alimony reached a huge sum of 30,000 yuan. After receiving the complaint, Zhou Guansan hired lawyer Zhang Li as his defender and appeared in court to respond to the hearing. At yesterday's continued hearing, both parties were present on time. According to Wang Yuqing, Zhou Guansan repeatedly cut off the water and electricity supply and did not provide alimony after leaving home. Therefore, she requested that the couple cohabitate and that Zhou pay 30,000 yuan in one lump sum as a security deposit for alimony. At the same time, she submitted several pieces of evidence to prove Zhou's standard of living. According to Zhou Guansan, his wife's treatment of him was not like that of a couple, but like that of an enemy. He gave way in every way, but she thought he was weak and easy to bully. Her violent nature caused neighbors to stare. The couple was like fire and water on a daily basis. Every day when he returned home, his wife would strictly check his bag, and even small amounts of money would be taken away. In addition to the agreed monthly household expenses, she often wanted unexpected demands. Because of his work, if he had any social engagements, she would falsely accuse him of having improper behavior. Such things were endless. Because of face and for the sake of his daughter and adopted son, he has been tolerating it without speaking out. Now she is striking first, focusing on money. Even in her request, the requests for cohabitation and alimony cannot be combined. Since they are cohabitating, there must be alimony. Moreover, Wang Yuqing used to make a living by teaching and was quite self-sufficient. Now, he has been unemployed for several years and has only recently found a job. During his idle time, he repeatedly advised her to save expenses, but his wife refused, resulting in the depletion of his savings. Although the salary of his current job is not small, he still wants to hire an assistant, so his income is limited. He relies entirely on the commission from the sale of airplanes, but airplanes are not easily sold goods, and there have been no transactions recently, so the income is very meager. However, Wang Yuqing has privately accumulated a large sum of money over the years, and now she is asking for living expenses, but in fact, her life is very affluent. Her accusations of doting on concubines, abusing his wife, and abandoning her are completely lies, as can be seen from the evidence she presented. Moreover, the evidence she submitted seems to be as many as eight pieces at first glance, but in fact, this kind of evidence has nothing to do with this case. It is nothing more than letters from bystanders attacking him out of spite, which are used to prove Mr. Zhou's character. This is completely contrary to the purpose of requesting cohabitation. There has never been a case in the world where a person wants a couple to cohabitate, but instead reveals the husband's secrets. Therefore, her request for cohabitation is a smokescreen, and in reality, she only wants a divorce and to receive alimony. If she does not want alimony, then in the past, when they were cohabitating, the monthly living expenses had to be paid in advance. He had already paid the expenses for July on the day he was forced to leave, and he also mailed the expenses for August on July 30, which was received and forwarded by her lawyer. After that, because she had filed a complaint in court, he did not send it. As for who should be responsible for leaving, there is factual evidence. On July 3, Wang Yuqing strongly wanted to force him to sign a divorce agreement at the lawyer's office. He refused and wanted to escape, but Wang Qing followed closely. Along the way, she shouted "thief," and a patrolman came out to stop him. After stating that it was a family dispute, he was able to escape and take refuge in his friend Xu Chengxuan's house. Wang chased to the door of Xu's house, inviting him to enter. Later, lawyer Song Yunhui came out to mediate. When they were about to take a car away from Xu's house, Wang grabbed the car, preventing him from getting away. Only after everyone's persuasion did she stop. At the same time, he fears Wang's usual ferocity, such as tearing his clothes, throwing bowls, and not letting him sleep at night. He is deeply afraid of not being safe at home, so he lives in the Youth Association to avoid her fierceness. So, who should be responsible for leaving? Based on the above facts, he now wants to file a counterclaim, requesting a divorce. Since marrying Wang Yuqing, she has had no respect for his parents, calling his father-in-law a thief and treating her husband like a slave. In November of the year before last, she forbade him to stay in the same room and drove him to live with the servants. On May 12 of last year, she disrupted his office and imprisoned and beat him, nearly killing him. In July of last year, she used shoes as weapons, hitting him on the head. After the Mid-Autumn Festival last year, she hit him on the head with a stick, breaking his skin and drawing blood. In March of this year, she tore new clothes. Her usual insults and abuses, which are not seen by outsiders, are too numerous to mention. Having such a fierce woman, he has suffered both mental and physical pain, which is consistent with Article 1052 of the Civil Code. Therefore, he requests a divorce and a rejection of the plaintiff's claim. After the case was heard and witnesses were questioned, the judge ordered that the evidence presented, which was irrelevant to the case, be returned. He also inquired about the matter of cutting off the water and electricity supply. Zhou Guansan replied that he had wanted to move elsewhere at that time, so he had returned the water and electricity. The house on Hede Road where he currently lives was temporarily occupied during the January 28th Incident, so the rent was as high as 140 yuan. Later, for the sake of saving money, he repeatedly wanted to move elsewhere, but Wang Yuqing firmly opposed it. However, with his financial resources, he is unable to live in this expensive house. At present, because his income is meager, as long as she returns to her original residence in Hangzhou, he can pay 50 yuan per month for living expenses, etc. At this point, the court began to debate. After the lawyers Zhang Li, representing Zhou, and Le Dan, representing Wang Yuqing, debated in succession, it was decided that sentencing would be on the afternoon of the 21st of this month.</p>

<p>The Proprietor and as Many as Forty-Four Gamblers Caught</p>
<p>Since his appointment, Rao Boze (transliteration), the Deputy Commissioner of the French Police Department, has paid great attention to investigating and prohibiting opium and gambling in the concession. He has secretly ordered detectives to strictly investigate. Recently, it has been discovered that Xi Rengeng, the manager of Da Hu Hotel at No. 341 Avenue Edward VII, rented Room 406 on the fourth floor to Qiu Zhongyuan (28 years old), a native of Shaoxing, to open a gambling den. Every day, he invited friends to gamble on Copper Treasure, Pai Gow, Mahjong, and Digging Flowers, providing everything. He profited by skimming the pot. It has been half a month since he started, and he has made a considerable profit. It has now been detected by Wang Rusong, a detective of the French Police Department, Detective Liu Jinrong, Shen Shu, and others. At 2 a.m. the night before last, they drove to search the premises. When they arrived, all the gamblers in the room were in high spirits. The detectives rushed into the room, and no one escaped.

The police lawyer stated the case and prosecuted them for gambling and property crimes, requesting that they be tried according to law. When questioned, the defendants confessed to skimming the pot, gathering people to gamble, and profiting. Judge Wu Fangshu examined the confessions and sentenced Qiu Zhongyuan to two months in prison and a fine of one hundred and twenty yuan for intending to profit by providing a venue for gathering people to gamble. Xie Kunsheng was sentenced to one month in prison and a fine of twenty yuan. Zhang Guiqing, Zhang Qiusheng, Che Xuehao, Chen Chunzi, Wang Shuzhen, Yang Hongcai, Zhu Zixian, Pu Achun, Yang Shi, Zhu Amei, Yuan Zhu, etc., eleven people were found to have no evidence of gambling and were all declared innocent.

To prevent this, in addition to submitting a request to the county government to issue a notice to inform the public, Director Zhang, accompanied by Zhao Ronghua and two others who are skilled in judging cattle, toured various villages yesterday to inspect the cattle one by one, taking the opportunity to encourage farmers to protect good breeding cattle to avoid a cattle shortage next spring. It was also found that the bull raised by Shen Rusheng did not meet the breeding cattle standards, and he was asked to stop breeding it to prevent the weakening of working cattle.</p>

<h3>Minutes of the South District Rent Reduction Association Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Nanshi District Rent Reduction Committee held a meeting yesterday at the association's auditorium in Yongqing Lane, Minguo Road. Eighty-two representatives from various branch associations attended (names detailed in the sign-in register). Yang Qiqing was elected as chairman, and Shen Qingzhai as recorder. After performing the rituals, the following resolutions were made: (1) In recent months, banks have been collapsing one after another. A portion of the rent in Nanshi was deposited in Jiande Bank. Now that the bank is suddenly being liquidated, how should this be handled? It was resolved that the deposit of rent is not comparable to those who seek special profits and should not be subject to the losses of liquidation discounts. A letter should be sent to the bank immediately, demanding withdrawal within a specific period to ensure the security of residence. (2) Lin Houcai reported that after the former chief accountant of the association, Shao Tinglu, was suspended from duty, he privately carved the reporter's seal and colluded with the landlord to print photos, falsely accusing the association's executive director, Mr. Shen Xinfu, to various agencies and organizations. How should this be handled? It was resolved that since Shao has accused the association to various agencies, all the accounts of the association should be compiled and submitted to higher authorities for review. Before this case is thoroughly investigated, Shao Tinglu's responsibility for all matters he handled should be borne by Hu Liangyu, the owner of Jutaicheng Store on Sangyuan Street, who is related to Shao. (3) The association's accounts should be thoroughly investigated first to clarify the truth. It was resolved that Hu Jiamo, Yang Qiqing, Che Shouchun, Shen Xingwu, and Chen Yuanling were elected as five members of the review committee to organize the review committee. Hu Jiamo will convene the committee, and the review will begin immediately. (4) The rent reduction issues of branch associations in Runde Lane, Minguo Road, Penglai Road, Jiezhufang, Dapu Road, and Sanxing Lane, Linyin Road, have all been resolved. It was resolved to send letters to the landlords expressing gratitude. (5) The branch associations in Zhaozhou Road, Ningde Lane, Xinqiao Road, and Qingyun Lane requested the dispatch of personnel to mediate rent reduction with the landlords. It was resolved to send Committee Member Ni, Committee Member Zhao Pin, Committee Member Shen Xingwu, and Committee Member Che Shouchun to attend the mediation together with the representatives of the branch associations. (6) The association's publication of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's special issue on rent reduction is difficult to collect contributions and is unlikely to be published on schedule. After the contributions are complete, it will still be widely distributed for reading and changed to a non-selling item without any money to promote publicity. It was resolved and passed. (7) The 23rd of this month is the memorial service for Mr. Shi Liangcai, general manager of Shen Bao. The association is prepared to participate. How should the branch associations express their views? It was resolved that each branch association should send two representatives to attend the memorial service. (8) The association's source of funding has never been determined, and it has not solicited subsidies from various agencies, organizations, and the general association. All expenses are donated by the branch associations within their means. Fearing that the outside world does not understand, should it be stated in the newspaper? It was resolved to publish a statement in the newspaper.</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Six: A Poor Girl Cannot be Ashamed to Teach, Why Blame the West Guest for Emptying Humility</p>
<p>She originally had some smiles, but at this moment, the smiles slowly disappeared, her eyebrows furrowed, her face was bitter, and she was almost about to cry. Jia Duocai sat on the edge of the bed, a cigarette hanging from his mouth, continuously puffing out smoke. His eyes were scanning Yueying up and down. Yueying dared not refuse him to look, afraid of interrupting the business. But a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl being looked at like this face-to-face, it was impossible not to feel embarrassed. So she didn't dare to lower her head completely, but only lowered her eyelids, not daring to pout, staring blankly at the quilts and pillows on the bed. In her heart, she thought that poor people were pitiful. Even feeling shy was not something they could easily do. Jia Duocai bounced his legs, and simply looked his fill, then smiled and said: Generally speaking, this marriage is a major event, and it cannot be accomplished vaguely, you must always ask her what she thinks. Sister-in-law Hu said: Don't worry, there can be no mistake in this matter, I can make the decision in this matter. Think about it, if she was unwilling, would she have repeatedly sent her to Master Jia? Just look at her watery eyes now, all fixed on Master Jia's bed. These words served as a reminder to Yueying, who immediately blushed, her face red all the way to the roots of her ears, and said to Sister-in-law Hu: You're talking nonsense! Sister-in-law Hu smiled and said: Look at this child, she doesn't even know any manners, how can you say I'm talking nonsense! Weren't you just staring at this bed? Yueying said: I was looking at the bed. I was thinking that Xi'an is really prosperous, and even the beds in a hotel are so nice. Jia Duocai smiled and said: Is Xi'an prosperous? Yueying saw that his eyes were fixed on her face, and couldn't help but lower her head again. Sister-in-law Hu said: Master Jia is asking you a question, why don't you answer? Yueying originally thought that if she lowered her head and mumbled something, it would pass. Unexpectedly, Sister-in-law Hu urged her like this from the side, leaving her no choice but to answer, so she nodded and hummed a sound from her nose. (91)</p>
<h3>Early Winter Street Scene</h3>
<p>— Jingxi</p>
<p>The sharp cold wind sweeps through the early winter streets.</p>
<p>Cheap flags flutter in the sky, the sidewalks that usually seem too narrow now feel wide, and after the sound of turning wheels, there are sighs from the roadside vendors.</p>
<p>In the glass windows of the stores, the shop assistants replaced the "autumn" character in the "autumn big sale" with a "winter" character. The mouth of the radio is facing the street, broadcasting the out-of-season tunes from the radio station into the ears of pedestrians, hoping to attract a few customers.</p>
<p>Passers-by may hesitate for a while in front of the elaborately arranged goods windows, but they do not have the courage to step into the store, disappointing the shopkeepers who have marked the lowest prices on the goods in large characters.</p>
<p>Books with a discount of 80% off are scattered on the roadside, and the words "cheap books" are also written on the new books, but they still cannot call back the market of the past!</p>
<p>At night, the red advertisements are reflected on the bright asphalt road. When the cold wind pierces into the gorgeous clothes of the laughing girls, the playful young people have "run out of money in their bedside," deeply inhaling the remaining cigarette butts, and a trace of regret seeps out from their shivering hearts, but it is already too late.</p>
<p>At dawn, the dung car drivers push their heavy carts through every alley, and the cleaners dutifully sweep the fallen yellow leaves from the ground.</p>
<p>Shanghai's prosperity?</p>
<p>Is Shanghai prosperous? It has withered and fallen with the autumn wind.</p>

<p>Society is like the cabinet in a Chinese medicine shop, able to accommodate all kinds of people, whether they are intelligent or foolish, superior or inferior, but just as medicine has the distinction of being life-giving or deadly, people also have the distinctions of being good or ugly, intelligent or foolish, virtuous or unworthy.</p>
<p>When sailing on the sea, if you suddenly encounter a hurricane, everyone on board knows that their lives are in danger and is uneasy. However, the national condition of China is struggling in this stormy environment, and the people in the country are still constantly singing and dancing, seeking happiness in a joyful circle. People's hearts are different, just like their faces, and it is not known what their intentions are.</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife of Firewood and Rice</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>I have a friend who is truly an oddball. He had two years of education at a university. He had lived with more than a dozen women. But he had never married any of them.</p>
<p>He was studying at a missionary university. Because he had an affair with a female student from a nearby girls' school, he was expelled by the school authorities, so he mixed in society, and at the same time, he began living with that female student.</p>
<p>He was expelled from the school, and also driven out by his parents because of the marriage problem, so he had a very weak concept of family.</p>
<p>After living together for a year, he was unemployed. The female student then had a conflict with him, and left him.</p>
<p>Later, he found a job, and lived with another woman. But in less than two years, they broke off the relationship due to disagreements. But soon, he lived with another woman.</p>
<p>From then on, every year or so, at most no more than three years, he would live with another woman. The reasons for breaking up were always no more than two: disagreement or the inability to maintain life after unemployment.</p>
<p>He has been mixing in society for twenty years, and has lived with a total of thirteen women. (Some say twelve, because there were two times when he lived with the same woman.) He had three children, all of whom were taken away by the mothers who bore them.</p>
<p>"Why don't you officially marry a wife, but always live like this?" A friend asked him once.</p>
<p>"The conditions for a husband and wife are nothing more than firewood and rice. Even if they are officially married, when there is no firewood or rice, can you guarantee that they won't come to this?" He said very clearly.</p>
<p>Starting two months ago, he was unemployed again. Less than a month after he was unemployed, his cohabitant broke off the relationship with him again.</p>

<h3>Cotton-Fluffing Women</h3>
<p>— Chunyu Louzhu</p>
<p>The giant wheel of time has advanced into the season of early winter. Generally, wealthy families, in order to plan ahead, are preparing the winter clothes they should wear.</p>
<p>Among the modern winter clothes, the most popular, suitable, lightweight, and economical must be silk floss.</p>
<p>In Huzhou city or the surrounding countryside, wearing silk floss is the most common. However, stuffing silk floss into cotton jackets, trousers, or long robes must be done by women who undertake this work. Therefore, every winter, the work of cotton-fluffing women is particularly busy, and they are almost always busy every day.</p>
<p>In Suzhou and Shanghai, we often find a red poster on doors or walls, which says: "Huzhou woman Ms. So-and-so, fluffs silk floss cotton clothes." The technique of fluffing cotton does have its good and bad points. The silk floss that a skilled cotton-fluffing woman stuffs inside a robe is very flat and smooth, and it still looks good even after wearing it for a winter. The long robe fluffed by a clumsy cotton-fluffing woman will shrink into a mess inside the robe in less than a month.</p>
<p>In the Huzhou area, hiring two women to fluff cotton, one doing the top and the other the bottom, costs about 30 cents per person per day in winter. In Shanghai and Suzhou, fluffing a long robe costs about one dollar and forty cents or two dollars in wages. Therefore, every winter, the small steamers from Huzhou to Shanghai always carry a dozen Huzhou women to Shanghai to work as cotton-fluffing women.</p>
<h3>Royal Fragrance Record</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>She wasn't talking to anyone, she was just talking to herself; after speaking, she lowered her head again and fiddled with the clay rabbit. The clay rabbit was still intact, but her beloved son was nowhere to be found! Seeing the object and hurting the heart, it was indeed very difficult for the old lady. We saw that her face had turned very pale, and her eyes were all red, but in order to maintain her dignity, she was still trying her best to endure it, not letting her tears fall. Such a painful expression was truly unbearable to watch. Therefore, I was also reminded of a legend I had heard outside the palace. This legend was not only circulating in people's mouths, but many historians and writers had also adopted it and recorded it as credible history. 丨They said that the death of Emperor Tongzhi was a conspiracy of the Empress Dowager, who, in order to seize power, did not hesitate to poison her youngest son to death. 丨 What a cruel rumor this is! I think that if these rumor-mongers could personally witness the Empress Dowager's grief after seeing Tongzhi's relics at this time, they would also deeply regret not having made such irresponsible remarks! Especially heartbreaking was that the Empress Dowager never knew about such a rumor outside, and didn't even have a chance to defend herself.</p>
<p>After staying in these courtyards filled with sorrow for about half a day, everyone felt tired; and we had seen all the relics of the emperors of the past dynasties, so we withdrew in formation, led by the Empress Dowager. At that time, the Empress Dowager did not put the clay rabbit that Tongzhi loved to play with back into the glass box. She held it herself, like she had picked up a treasure, very solemnly. Usually, she never carried anything while walking. Everything she needed was carried by others for her. She was simply always empty-handed. This time, she actually held a toy so solemnly, which further showed how deeply she missed Tongzhi. (201)</p>
<p>Science Trivia</p>
<h3>Obstacles of Coffee to Reproductive Function</h3>
<p>— Xinong</p>
<p>Although coffee is only produced in the tropics (such as the South Indian Islands, Cuba, etc.), it is sold all over the world, and is an indispensable drink for Europeans and Americans, just like tea in China. Although the history of coffee in China is not long, it has become widely welcomed and loved by the general upper and middle classes in cities. The reason is that coffee contains a kind of alkaloid (caffeine) which has a strong exciting effect on the nerves, so it is popular and loved by people who are tired from work and those who are poor in life and want to pursue stimulation. At the same time, in accordance with the law that Westernization is modern, drinking coffee has also become an indispensable condition for modern people. Therefore, coffee has become a kind of enjoyment in urban life.</p>
<p>Regarding the impact of coffee on the human body, some people previously worried that drinking it often would cause nerve and heart weakness, but these do not seem to be significant under normal drinking levels. Recently, a German university professor used domestic rabbits to conduct actual experiments to see what physiological changes would occur after feeding them coffee. As a result, he discovered an unexpected and interesting fact, that is, after domestic rabbits were fed coffee for a considerable period of time, no changes occurred in other organs, but the gonads first showed serious pathological changes, and it was proven that this toxic phenomenon was the effect of caffeine in coffee.</p>
<p>The actual situation of the experiment is approximately as follows: At first, he only fed domestic rabbits a moderate amount of coffee. At this time, it can be clearly seen that the domestic rabbits are in a state of strong excitement, and they run around non-stop, as if they are eagerly looking for something, or like a person who has frustrating things but cannot vent them and reveals that kind of irritability. Afterwards, due to excessive fatigue, they enter a state of weakness and sleep very quietly. 丨After being fed like this every day and excited like this every day, it can be seen that the intensity of excitement is gradually weakening, until it no longer produces excitement. Now its reaction to the effect of coffee has become a habit. However, at this time, although other organs of the body are no different from normal, the gonads have already shown pathological changes. At this time, if a male rabbit that has been poisoned by coffee is allowed to mate with a female rabbit that has not eaten coffee, the number of young rabbits born is the same as usual, but most of them die within the first week after birth. Such as coffee feeding. If the time is longer, then although it can still mate, it cannot make the female pregnant. If the testicles are cut into slices and observed under a microscope, it can be seen that sperm cells are discharged in large quantities before they mature, and at the same time, part of the seminiferous tubules of the testicles have atrophied. From this, the depth of the poisoning can be seen. In female rabbits, the damage caused by poisoning is more serious. Because female rabbits are much more sensitive to the effects of coffee, the amount of coffee that male rabbits can tolerate is often enough to kill female rabbits. Female rabbits only needed to be fed coffee for a week to lose the ability to become pregnant, and microscopic examination of the ovaries showed that the larger follicles that were about to mature had all atrophied, because the egg cells in the follicles had already died. After two or three weeks, even the smaller follicles that had just grown had died out. After five or six weeks, not only had all the follicles disappeared, but even the intermediate tissue had rapidly degenerated. At this time, the structure of each female rabbit's ovary was simply no different from that of an undeveloped young rabbit.</p>
<p>Due to the above-mentioned experiments, it has been undeniably proven that coffee (that is, caffeine, because coffee from which alkaloids have been removed does not produce the above-mentioned effects) is an absolute gonad toxin, and it can be said that the toxicity is very severe. Now, although the results of this kind of animal experiment cannot be immediately extrapolated to humans and it is certain that there will be the same situation, and it seems that no significant examples have been found in daily life, but ordinary humans are more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than rabbits. From this point, coffee lovers cannot but pay great attention!</p>

<h3>Tit For Tat Never Ends, French Business Hangs Up The No-War Sign</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Match Against Donghua Abandoned For No Reason</p>
<p>Thousands Of Fans Returned Disappointed</p>
<p>The match between Donghua and French Business, originally scheduled for the afternoon yesterday at Shen Garden for the Western League Group A competition, was unexpectedly not attended by French Business at the last minute. Nearly ten thousand spectators went with excitement and returned disappointed, complaining incessantly. The details of the incident are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Competing To See Good Games After seven consecutive victories, Donghua has a 90% certainty of winning the Group A championship, so it is highly loved by fans. The French Business Association, the champion of the previous tournament, has been mediocre this season and no longer has the prestige of the past, but once the warriors are gathered, their strength is still not weak. Last week's victory over Youyou by two to one in the Shi Gaota Cup is a clear proof. Therefore, yesterday when they met with Donghua at Shen Garden, the fans at sea, appreciating this rare opportunity for a "good game," all competed to be the first to see it, each fearing to be the last. The number was close to ten thousand. On Jiaozhou Road and Yanping Road, they hurried along, like on the Shanyin Road. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at the stadium, they had to eat a closed door. The feeling of disappointment at the time was difficult to describe in words. Everyone did not know the reason, and still lingered, reluctant to leave. After finding out the truth, they slowly returned disappointed.</p>
<p>The Process of the Suspension The time pointed to half past one, and the fans had already arrived one after another. Suddenly, a Westerner came and went straight into the stadium office, claiming to be related to French Business, saying that French Business could not attend today because of other things, the players were not complete, etc. Then, Mr. Zhou Jiaqi, a staff member of the Sports Association, got this news and immediately asked French Business by telephone, which was true. At this time, ticket sales had already begun, so he explained to the crowd the reason for today's no-show and told them to return their tickets. On the one hand, notices were posted at the east and west entrance gates. At that time, the viewers flocked to the ticket refund. As for whether the absence of French Business should be treated as a forfeit, it still needs to be resolved by the Western League Football Association.</p>
<p>Tit For Tat According to other sources, the reason why French Business did not attend the match was due to old grievances. In the middle of the season last year, during the match between Donghua and French Business at the China Baseball Stadium, at 2:30, Donghua was still not seen at the venue. The Association immediately asked Donghua by telephone and was told that the players were not complete and no one was responsible, and no one could come to the stadium to play, etc. Therefore, the match was abandoned for no reason on that day, and they were told to refund their tickets. Afterwards, the Western League did not judge Donghua to have forfeited. Yesterday, when the enemies met again, French Business also staged the story of Donghua last year, tit for tat, etc.</p>
<h3>In The Quarter-Finals of the Chinese Group B Cup, Qunhua Defeats Dajiang to Gain the Right to The Final</h3>
<p>The Result is Four Against One, Both Teams of the Chinese Group Win Against Huqing</p>
<p>After the quarter-final of the Chinese Football Association Group B Cup, the match between Qunhua and Dajiang ended in a draw last week. It was replayed at Shen Garden the other day. Dajiang is the champion of the China School League and the embodiment of Pudong Middle School. In the next game, they defeated Huqing, the strong team from West Shanghai, by five to one. The Qunhua team has not encountered any opponents in the Cup competition. For the sake of prudence, the Football Association specially appointed Mr. Zhou Jiaqi, a staff member of the Association, as the referee. It can be seen from this that they attach great importance to the game. After the start of the game, both sides treated each other as strong enemies and fought cautiously, with very little excitement, so that at the end of the first half, neither side had achieved anything. When the war started again, Qunhua brought in fresh troops, He Sirong, and then the situation changed greatly. In the territory of Dajiang, enemy shoes were everywhere. After three to zero, Dajiang began to break through the encirclement, breaking the duck egg and pulling back a goal, but it was only a flash in the pan. Qunhua launched a large-scale offensive again, and Liang Yaohong came again. Before long, the silver horn sounded, and time was not on their side. Dajiang surrendered at the ratio of four to one. Qunhua's lineup is as follows</p>
<p>Zhou Yeqin</p>
<p>Xiao Guorong Zhou Yi Deng Jinkun</p>
<p>Xu Baoshi Zhu Jiongpei Liang Yaohong</p>
<p>Tan Dapei Zhou Benfang He Sirong</p>
<p>Zheng Jianxi</p>
<p>Zheng Guirong</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 16th) at 10:00 am, a Chinese Football Association Chinese Group League match was played with the Huqing team at the Xiaoshadu Huqing Stadium. After 90 minutes of fierce battle, both teams relied on the soldiers' efforts and won by a ratio of four to one. The left wing Yu Keng alone scored three goals, and the left forward Zhu Zhenhe scored one goal. The whole team cooperated skillfully, and the team members were modest and commendable. They fought purely with skills and were especially commendable.</p>

<p>Chatter</p>
<p>Yesterday, hundreds of men and women traveled from Shanghai to Qingyang Port to play and watch the race. Of course, the railway bureau's purpose has been achieved, doing a lot of business. The garden hotel, which is located in a remote wilderness and neglected, was bustling with activity for a while.</p>
<p>There were also no shortcomings in the layout. There was no suitable viewing location, which made those who trekked to Qingyang Port cry out in pain and disappointment.</p>
<p>The hotel authorities also lacked adequate equipment in advance. Knowing that there must be many people going, just in terms of the number of participating boy scouts, there were more than hundreds, then the restaurant should have made sufficient preparations, but yesterday there were diners who waited for more than an hour before getting food. This gentleman brought two children and couldn't help but roar in anger. The hospitality was even more out of the question. Furthermore, the manager of the hotel, Wang, was unusually slow in serving guests.</p>
<p>The small reception room of the Garden Hotel was occupied by the boy scouts, causing tourists to retreat. Several boy scouts from the 119th regiment almost clashed with tourists due to their arrogant attitude.</p>
<p>The railway bureau knew that there would be many people returning from Qingyang Port and should have added vehicles, but on the express train last night, due to overcrowding, people could not sit even in the first and second class cars, and countless people had to stand all the way to Shanghai, which is also a pity.</p>

Although Fanghui fought bravely, they were no match for Liangjiang due to the difference in strength. The result was 50 to 8, with Fanghui losing. The Liangjiang team achieved a great victory.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Laughing and Crying</h3>
<p>— Huanming</p>
<p>Perhaps in the general perception, those who are sorrowful for the world are mostly seen with a bitter face; those who are optimistic seem to have to laugh a lot every day.</p>
<p>But that's not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>There is a nation in the world that walks with faltering steps, their faces always looking miserable, but in fact, they are very optimistic: they don't care about the lessons of history. Chinese people, on the other hand, constantly have smiles twitching on their faces, and their shoulders are rarely steady, but in fact, they should indeed be pessimistic.</p>
<p>So, it is often difficult to see the truth beneath the surface of things in the world.</p>
<p>A General Armstrong devoted his life to serving black people. After his death, the following sentence was found in his diary:</p>
<p>"I never understood what the word sacrifice meant!"</p>
<p>It is truly admirable that a person of color could devote his life to serving and saving black people and utter such great words. His sacrifice was certainly not motivated by emotion but by reason. Precisely because of reason, he could not understand what sacrifice was; precisely because he could do this, he was even more admirable. Lyman Abbott said in an article about a doctor: he was unwilling to practice in London but preferred to practice in Labrador, not because the income there was greater; he went because the income in that small place was so little that no doctor was willing to go.</p>
<p>People like those mentioned above seem to be "indifferent," and perhaps people think they are optimistic; in fact, they are all sorrowful for the world. They are sorrowful for the world, which is fine: as long as they don't forget the world because of their sorrow.</p>
<p>In every corner of the world where people live, people's expressions are often shown to others. In the crowd of people laughing loudly, there are many with their stomachs full of bitterness, but a smile should still be ready at the corner of the lips, otherwise, after three days without a smile, creditors may suspect that you are about to go bankrupt. Of course, there are also many people who are happy on the outside and optimistic on the inside. But I feel that all these people share a kind of easily satisfied personality that cannot create the world. Their loud laughter is often not as good as the silence of those who are sorrowful for the world: in their silence, the miserable world will gradually become clearer.</p>
<p>Why? Those who are sorrowful for the world allow themselves to be truly serious, but if they keep the world in their minds and carry the world on their backs, they can often bite their lips and endure suffering. They will not laugh to others at any time like the optimistic, cry at any time, or turn tears into smiles at any time; a person who is sorrowful for the world often does not haggle over the happiness and misfortune of life: they are just never satisfied, and thus create the world.</p>
<p>Are those who are silent like hermits sorrowful for the world? Hiding in the study, drinking tea, and smoking, they may indeed rarely smile on their faces, but when carefully considering their words and deeds, they should be classified as optimistic.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who are determined to save the world are those who are willing to cut open the world to see it truly, concretely, and honestly.</p>
<h3>A Prisoner from Another Life</h3>
<p>— Caoming</p>
<p>The morning breeze of July, blowing from the small river that semi-embraces Guihua Village, gently caresses all life – sometimes, lying beside the ears of the silk-reeling women who are sleeping soundly, as if whispering: "Baby, get up, the factory whistle is calling you."</p>
<p>As soon as the sky opened its eyes, Wangcai's aunt – the woman with the pointed mouth, in her forties – had already finished feeding the pigs from the pigsty. She put down the slop bucket, walked into the house, pulled open the curtains, and carefully asked her daughter: "Does your eye still hurt? Sleep a little longer, anyway, even if you rush, the silk factory may not be working; working for an extra day or two won't necessarily earn enough money to treat your eyes..." The woman didn't hear her daughter's reply and began to curse to herself. "How annoying, that little slut next door, cries every day before dawn until daylight, even worse than our little pigs!" Then she lit incense sticks, took them outside, and prepared to insert them in front of the "Earth God" shrine. At this time, Yuanjiao, the aunt with the low nose and big mouth across the street, was greeting her.</p>
<p>"Is Second Sister's eye better?" the big-mouthed woman said. But after hearing the other's reply, she shook her head and immediately changed the subject, "It's so strange, why can't I hear Auntie Huanglian's whistle-like voice this morning? Just that little ghost's piercing cry keeps bothering my ears! Sigh, that cheap bone, cheap meat... Hasn't Auntie Huanglian gotten up yet!" Yuanjiao said, pacing to the house diagonally opposite her, next door to Wangcai's aunt, with a fence as a wall. "Auntie Wu, doesn't getting up and taking a look at what's going on with that little fellow mean anything?"</p>
<p>No one answered.</p>
<p>Yuanjiao pushed open the single door woven with bamboo strips, rudely stepped inside, and spoke loudly. When she clearly saw Huanglian Wu lying under the Guanyin Bodhisattva shrine, and Zhuanfu, naked, crawling beside her like a wounded crab and crying, she wisely stood quietly against the wall, without a sound.</p>
<p>After a while, the woman lying on the ground crawled up like a pile of garbage, glanced at her neighbor, waved her hand, then picked up the fire tongs on the ground, wrapped them in red paper, and carefully placed them next to the incense burner.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay," she picked up Zhuanfu, who was rolling on the ground, thin, and frail, like a package, made her lie flat on the plank bed, then turned around, pulled Yuanjiao, and Wangcai, who had quietly sneaked in sometime, to the bedside, pointed out the two thumb-sized red burn marks on the little girl's buttocks, and dabbed some raw oil on them. As soon as her finger touched the flesh, the little girl cried out in an extremely sharp voice:</p>
<p>"Spare... me, I will listen to you from now on..."</p>
<p>"Bah, haven't I already spared your life? Who wants you...? Sleep well!" Auntie Huanglian took her water pipe, beckoned to the two neighboring women, and walked together to the open space in front of the door.</p>
<p>"Was it really because she peed again in the middle of the night?" asked Wangcai's aunt with the pointed mouth honestly.</p>
<p>"I also think it's strange, why did she cry so fiercely this morning?" Like all the female workers, Qiaoqi, with her pale face, was just grabbing her tangled hair and passing by here, stopping and inserting a question. "When there's no work, you just happen to get up early, sigh... Auntie Wu, you're already in this state, what do you still need this little pig for?"</p>
<p>"Don't need her? Who hasn't thought that! You don't know how pitiful her grandmother looked back then!" As she spoke, she gestured, and the burning tip of the paper strip drew many fleeting, irregular red arcs in the air. "Looking back, when I was still young, how did our mulberry land deceive me, treating the most disgusting fertilizer as gold! Unfortunately, I myself didn't even lay a single egg, who will inherit our foundation? "Raise a 'starter flower,' she'll bring you a little brother," someone advised me. Soon, Dead Ghost Third Aunt brought an old woman from Baishi, with thick eyebrows and eyes, in her fifties, to see me…" "Hey, what's this, is this fun?" Qiaoqi, who had just gone into the house to see the burnt girl, frowned and covered one side of her face and cried out.</p>
<p>"That old woman almost knelt down," Auntie Huanglian stubbornly rolled her eyes, not answering her, but continuing the story. "Speaking to me in a very urgent tone, "She's a 'Prospering Outsider,' not one who prospers the ancestral family. As soon as she was born, her father got a serious illness, and the fortune teller said she had to leave home immediately. I think over and over, she's grown up in a farming family her whole life, and it certainly won't do her any good, what kind of world is it now? The world of those with mulberry land and those who open silk factories. Like me, I'm old, just waiting for my time; but why don't we give that little life some more hope? Believe me, she's a 'Prospering Outsider.'"</p>
<p>"That poor old woman, without waiting for me to decide, sent the baby the next day. I didn't delay for a moment and immediately gave her a lucky name. The 'Zhuan' in Zhuanfu means she's been exchanged to another family. Smoke Five – sigh, Dead Ghost was still called Xun Wu back then, he didn't smoke opium yet, he was a very diligent fellow – he was very opposed to me, saying I was creating trouble out of nothing. But I firmly believed in my own ideas: if a person does their best – if they're not greedy – then they will definitely find satisfaction in life. Wangcai's aunt, don't you think so?" She put out the paper strip and put the water pipe on the ground.</p>
<p>The woman with the withered yellow face in her thirties was speaking very excitedly, and after two more women living nearby joined halfway, she became even more impassioned, rubbing her hands together, sometimes clapping them hard, as if to make people pay special attention.</p>
<p>"The first thing that shattered my belief was Xun Wu's addiction to opium. That living corpse, even when the mulberry market was still booming, he had already stopped going to the mulberry fields! How many people are there in the family? Naturally, everything fell on my shoulders... Now, I also don't want to go to that place that makes me unhappy; selling it, no one wants it, planting vegetables, I can't eat that much myself…" She changed her position and patted the big-mouthed woman on the shoulder.</p>
<p>"Just like my rotten-eyed girl doesn't want to meet the silk factory…" Wangcai's aunt sighed.</p>
<p>"I used to seem to understand life, and I also knew how to scheme to make life more comfortable. From the fact that fertilizer became disliked by the villagers, I knew the world had changed, no matter how it changed, it changed in a way that made me disbelieve it!</p>
<p>"Later, I tried even harder," she clapped her hands again, as if the yearning from many years ago was still burning. "At the beginning of every 'harvest,' I first made a vow before the Bodhisattva for "three sacrifices," "dragon robes"... But, Auntie Yuanjiao, you should remember, if you hadn't persuaded me, I was afraid I would be punished by the gods, I wasn't happy to fulfill my vows! What else do I believe in? The world has become so strange!..." She lowered her head for a while.</p>
<p>"After all, I'm not a stupid woman. After Dead Ghost Smoke Five passed away, I tried to tie my fate to Zhuanfu. My God, this plague star! But strangely enough, as if guided by divine power, the day before yesterday I ran to the Jinghui Nunnery and asked Master Jinghui to personally check Zhuanfu's past lives in the Book of Three Lives. It turned out that she was a fugitive in her previous life! I looked at the real scene according to Master Jinghui's instructions, that fellow – the groom of an official's family – was extremely cruel, killed his master, and set fire to his master's villa, but finally escaped! So in this life, hum, I'm afraid she can't escape some torment, wherever she goes, she has to mess up that place. A troublemaker, it turns out she owes a kind of punishment, sigh, owes a kind of punishment! I have reported this matter in detail to the gods, so the Bodhisattva can prove that I am not a black-hearted character! Everyone will understand, right? Who would still listen to their own temper and deliberately torment such a pitiful descendant of a great thief?</p>
<p>"Okay, let good luck come back into our home!" She bent down, picked up the water pipe, and prepared to go into the house.</p>
<p>"My God! Does she actually believe these stupid ideas? Then, what about us, we've been tormented all our lives, is someone giving us a kind of punishment again?" Wangcai's aunt seemed to have been feeling depressed for a long time, and a gust of anger burst out from her stomach. Several of the women standing next to her nodded knowingly.</p>
<h3>Great Human Nature</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>Mr. Ran Qing tells us two stories in his "Essays on Literature and Art": The poet Alexander Blok met a street prostitute on a bleak night. He gave her all he had with him, but left her with a heavy and gloomy mood. The painter Vincent van Gogh saved a starving old woman in the rain and snow but would rather go hungry himself.</p>
<p>Then he raised his question: Blok gave all he had, but could that prostitute save herself and stop selling laughter on the streets with that little bit of money? Van Gogh saved that old woman, but if he encountered a second or third such pitiful woman and had no money left, what power would he have to help them? From this question, he drew his conclusion: "Poor artists! You should think big!"</p>
<p>"Think big!" Is this right? Yes! I dare say that not only artists, but simply anyone who is not an individualist should have in their mind a bright society where all mankind can live and work in peace and contribute all their life force to realizing this bright society.</p>
<p>However, can we say that Blok's and Van Gogh's actions were useless and wrong because they "thought big"? No! Rather than saying that their actions were useless and wrong, it is better to say that their actions were very great. They did not neglect the small things because they "thought big." From a human standpoint, they fully recognized the mission of human beings and exerted the power of human beings.</p>
<p>Let us imagine that Blok and Van Gogh at that time, if they had held the concept of "building mansions for millions of people," recognized that this was a whole social problem, and turned away, thinking that all pity was useless until the entire society was reformed to the point where everyone could live and work in peace, then what would be the difference between their actions and those of ordinary wealthy merchants? Only because they could forget their own hunger to save others did their greatness show.</p>
<p>Taking this year's drought as an example, the disaster area has spread to as many as eleven provinces, and there are no fewer than hundreds of thousands of disaster victims who have no clothes, no food, and are wandering around. If everyone took the same view as Mr. Zaiqing, "think big" and turn a blind eye, then wouldn't these hundreds of thousands of disaster victims have already starved to death before a bright society appeared before our eyes?</p>
<p>We must have lofty ambitions, and we must take the creation of a bright future society as our responsibility, but we should not neglect this painful present stage.</p>
<p>Every issue has its two sides and the unity of opposites. I hope that before advising "poor artists" to "think big," Mr. Zaiqing had better turn around and think about the small things that he has neglected.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow (18)</h3>
<p>— by Joseph Conrad, translated by Wu Xiangyu</p>
<p>She felt she must speak. “That is another of your cruel songs,” she said.</p>
<p>“Learned in Sonora, in Mexico,” he answered, composed. “It’s a song of the Capocineros. You don’t know? It’s the song of the restless. Nothing can keep him in one place—not even a woman. Formerly, in the border of the placer diggings, you could meet one or two, going north across the Gila River. I have seen them. An engineer of a mining plant in Mazatlan took me with him to watch over a wagon train. One wants a handy fellow like a sailor, anyway. The country is all desert; cracks in the ground you can’t see the bottom of; and high mountains—all rocks, towering up, like walls and steeples of churches, only a hundred times bigger. The valleys below full of boulders and black stones. Not a blade of grass to be seen; the sun there baking redder than I have ever seen it anywhere—as red and fierce as blood. Fine scenery, that.”</p>
<p>“You would not go back there?” she murmured.</p>
<p>He smiled a little. “No. It’s a cursed mining country. Sometimes the sight of it made me shiver—you know, we were many together; but the Capocineros they wander alone. They knew the country before any one had ever heard of its name. They have a talent for gold, and the fever, too; but it seems as if they did not care much for the gold. They would find a rich place, and then go away; perhaps take only a little gold—enough to have one good spree—and then go away to look for some more. They never stayed long in the places where there were plenty of houses; they had no wives, no children, no home, and never a companion. You couldn’t make a friend of a Capocinero: they were too restless—here to-day and gone to-morrow to God knows where. They did not tell people of their finds, and there never was a rich Capocinero. It was not the gold they cared for; it was the running to and fro in the mountains after it that gave them no rest; and that is why no woman could live with a Capocinero for more than a week. That is what the song tells about. It’s all about a beautiful girl trying to keep the love of a Capocinero so he would bring her lots of gold. Don’t be afraid! He went away, and she never saw him again.”</p>
<p>“What became of her?” she sighed.</p>
<p>“The song does not say. Cried a bit, I expect. That’s the sort of people they are: to kiss and go away. But it was after something—something that matters∶∶∶∶∶∶∶∶∶∶∶ sometimes I think I am a bit of a Capocinero myself.”</p>
<p>“Then no woman can hold you?” she began in a husky voice, which broke into a tremble towards the end.</p>
<p>“Not for a week,” he joked, with that light and gentle tone of laughter that sent a shiver down her spine; “but I love them all. Anything for a good woman. They make me unhappy and they make me happy! I love them as soon as I see them. I’m in love with you now, Miss—Bethan is your name—isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“She recoiled a little, laughing tremulously. “You haven’t seen my face yet.”</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>The Recent Trade Advantages of Japan</h3>
<p>— Bisson</p>
<p>The expansion of Japanese trade, starting in August 1932, has become an economic enigma for the world. Other countries, even if they have recovered, have mainly done so within their own territories; while Japan has mostly concentrated on foreign trade. Other countries can only recover a small portion of their lost foreign markets, but Japan's entire trade has reached the level before the recession.</p>
<p>Although the expansion of Japanese trade is mostly in cotton yarn, rayon, and woolen yarn, the export of other goods has also increased. Between 1931 and 1933, calculated in Japanese Yen, the export value of Japanese cotton yarn and cotton fabrics doubled, rayon and rayon fabrics increased by two times, and woolen yarn and woolen fabrics increased more than seven times. During the same period, the export value of Japanese porcelain, glass, lamps, medicines, and chemical products doubled; canned food and hardware increased by two times; toys, dyes, and vehicles (bicycles and parts) increased by two times; and straw braids increased by three times.</p>
<p>Expansion of Japanese Trade</p>
<p>The general trend of Japan's trade over the past six years can be seen in the first table. Both imports and exports in 1932 and 1933 exceeded those of 1931. However, the total value of imports and exports in 1933 was still below the level of 1924-1929. Nevertheless, the export value in 1933 exceeded that of 1932 by 32% and that of 1931 by 62.30%. This not only slightly exceeded the export value of 1924 (1,607,035), but also reached the general level of 1924-1929.</p>
<p>Since 1929, a significant change has occurred in Japan's trade balance. Except for the extraordinary periods of the Great War, imports have always exceeded exports, with the highest import surplus between 1920 and 1928. In the five years since 1929, the import surplus has generally been below 100 million Yen. The very low import surpluses in 1932 and 1933 indicate, on one hand, an increase in exports, and on the other hand, relatively low imports.</p>
<p>Table 1: Total Value of Japan's Foreign Trade from 1928 to 1933 (Unit: 1,000 Yen)</p>
<p>Exports     Imports     Total Exports and Imports     Import Surplus</p>
<p>1928     1,971,955     2,196,315     4,168,270     224,359</p>
<p>1929     2,148,619     2,216,240     4,364,859     67,621</p>
<p>1930     1,469,852     1,546,071     3,015,923     76,219</p>
<p>1931     1,146,981     1,235,673     2,382,654     88,691</p>
<p>1932     1,409,992     1,431,461     2,841,453     21,469</p>
<p>1933     1,861,046     1,917,220     3,778,266     56,174</p>
<p>The changes in the export values of Japan over the past six years are detailed in the second table. These figures refer to mainland Japan, excluding Korea and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Table 2: Volume and Value of Japan's Exports from 1928 to 1933 (Unit: 1,000)</p>
<p>Volume     Index     Yen Value     Index     Gold Value     Index</p>
<p>1928     6,485     100.0     1,971,955     100.0     915,184     100.0</p>
<p>1929     6,206     95.7     2,148,619     108.9     990,513     108.2</p>
<p>1930     6,246     96.4     1,469,852     74.5     725,960     79.3</p>
<p>1931     5,295     81.8     1,146,981     58.1     566,150     61.9</p>
<p>1932     5,956     91.8     1,409,992     71.5     396,349     43.3</p>
<p>1933     7,307     112.7     1,861,046     94.4     374,256     40.9</p>
<p>A significant phenomenon of Japanese trade is the large increase in export volume. In 1933, Japan's export volume exceeded that of 1928 by nearly one million tons. The increase in volume, as expressed by the index, is 112.7, while the value (Yen) index is only 94.4. This indicates a drop in the price of Japanese goods. However, although Japanese exports have increased in both volume and value, when expressed in US dollars, the exports in 1933 fell to the lowest level.</p>
<p>Since 1929, a major change has occurred in Japan's international payments. In 1928, the net import surplus reached 173 million Yen, which was paid for by capital loans of 116.5 million Yen. This was the usual method of Japan's international payments. Japanese construction factories were all financed by foreign loans. However, during the period of 1929-1931, the opposite phenomenon occurred. Since 1929, the net export of goods and gold has been used to offset capital loans. Therefore, Japan has changed from a capital-importing country to a capital-exporting country.</p>
<p>Geographical Distribution of Japanese Exports</p>
<p>Apart from raw silk, which is mostly exported to the United States, most of Japan's exports are cheap manufactured goods. The market for these goods is in colonial or semi-colonial countries. The recovery of Japanese trade in 1932 had a new phenomenon, namely, rapid development in the low-price markets of Africa, the Near East, and Latin America. The markets that Japan lost in the Far East after 1929 were nearly recovered in 1933, and the markets in the Near East and Latin America even exceeded the records of 1929. The third table shows the changes in Japan's trade with Asian countries between 1928 and 1933.</p>

<p>According to the third table, although Japan's trade generally recovered in 1933, trade with mainland China decreased by 200 million Yen compared to 1928. The common reasons given are the boycott movement, higher Chinese tariffs, and the development of domestic industries in China. However, these facts are not entirely credible. Since May 1932, the boycott movement has subsided; and the high tariffs faced by Japanese goods, even higher than those in China, have been overcome; and it has even been able to compete with the textile industry in British India. This seems to be due to the large-scale smuggling or re-export of Japanese goods to China, so the total exports of Japan cannot be reflected in the Chinese customs trade books. Undoubtedly, Japan's actual exports to China far exceed the recorded figures. Since July 3, 1934, the Chinese government implemented a reduction in Chinese tariffs, which has greatly increased Japan's exports to China.</p>
<p>Japan's exports to Northeast China and Kwantung increased by more than 100 million Yen in 1933 compared to 1928. British India is Japan's second largest market in Asia, and Japan's exports to India in 1932-1933 are approximately equal to the high level of 1929. The most significant progress is in the Dutch East Indies, where Japan's export volume (in Yen) in 1933 doubled compared to 1928-1929. Japan's trade with the Philippines changed little between 1928 and 1933, but there has been a large increase in the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Calculated in Yen, Japan's exports to Asian countries in 1933 were slightly higher than the peak of 1929. However, the recovery of old markets is far less than the conquest of new markets such as Africa, the Near East, and Latin America. In 1933, Japan's exports to Africa and Oceania increased by about double compared to 1928-1929.</p>
<p>Content of Japan's Foreign Trade</p>
<p>Most of Japan's foreign trade is in light industrial products or semi-manufactured products such as raw silk. The most important are yarn and textiles. Currently, the development in this area is mainly in rayon and woolen fabrics. The export situation of Japanese rayon and woolen fabrics since 1931 can be seen in the fourth table. The increase in this type of export is much faster than that of silk fabrics and cotton fabrics. The export value of rayon and woolen fabrics in 1933 reached 100 million Yen. The profits of Japanese rayon and woolen fabric companies are developing in direct proportion to the increase in their exports to foreign countries. The profit of the Japanese woolen fabric industry was 12.2% in 1932, and increased to 17.5% in the second half of 1933. The rayon industry increased from 10.4% to 24.2% during the same period.</p>
<p>Table 4: Japan's Textile Exports from 1931 to 1933 (Unit: 1,000 Yen)</p>
<p>1931     1932     1933     Percentage Increase in Two Years</p>
<p>Raw Silk     555,594     382,566     390,901     10.0</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn     8,511     21,547     5,712     84.6</p>
<p>Rayon     2,245     5,911     9,483     422.4</p>

<p>Silk Fabrics     43,053     50,288     63,545     147.6</p>

<p>Rayon Fabrics     39,713     60,540     77,382     194.9</p>

<p>Total     649,905     815,543     957,908</p>
<p>The increase in Japan's cotton cloth exports is widely distributed, as shown in the fifth table. The largest increases were in Manchuria, the Dutch East Indies, British India (1932), Egypt, Australia, and other countries. This expansion is constantly encountering tariff barriers. The tariff walls seem to be effective only in British India, Turkey, and South Africa. Despite various obstacles, Japan's cotton cloth exports exceeded those of 1932 by 60 million square yards in 1933.</p>
<p>The main decrease in 1933 was in India, where Japan's cotton cloth exports decreased by about one-third compared to 1932. There was also a large decrease in China, for reasons already mentioned. However, the increase in exports to Manchuria and Kwantung was offset by the decrease in exports to mainland China and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In these four places, in 1929, Japan sold 671,346,000 square yards of cotton cloth; in 1933, it sold only 319,869,000 square yards.</p>

<p>Competition Between British and Japanese Textile Industries</p>
<p>The cotton textile industries of Lancashire and India have felt the significant impact of the recent surge in Japan's cotton cloth exports. In August 1932, the Indian government took measures to combat this threat by increasing tariffs and granting greater preferences to British goods. In 1933, a serious dispute arose, which was resolved in early 1934 with the settlement of the Indo-Japanese issue.</p>
<p>The Indo-Japanese Commercial Treaty has been concluded and will expire on March 31, 1937. The treaty stipulates that the two countries are special reciprocal nations. However, if the exchange rate of the Yen against the Rupee changes after December 31, 1933, the Indian government may levy special surcharges on Japanese goods. Japan will have the same measures if the value of the Rupee falls below 0.732 Yen. Apart from the above-mentioned changes, the Indian government has set 50% as the maximum tax rate for Japanese cotton goods. The tax rate for British goods is 25%.</p>
<p>The quota system stipulates that from April 1 to March 31, Japan can sell 325 million yards of cotton goods to India, and from January 1 to December 31, it must purchase one million bales of raw cotton from India.</p>
<p>In addition, the competition between Britain and Japan has not yet been resolved. Before the recession, Japan's exports gradually increased in the world cloth market, while Britain's gradually decreased. Since 1929, this trend has intensified, until in 1933, Japan's total exports exceeded those of Britain. The changes in the British and Indian textile industries in 1927 can be seen in the table below:</p>

<p>Advantages of Japanese Competition</p>
<p>The two main reasons for the progress of Japanese exports are: (1) low cost, and (2) the extreme depreciation of the Yen. A detailed examination reveals that the depreciation of the currency is the main reason.</p>
<p>The low cost of Japanese industry is due to low wages and long working hours. In 1931, although Japanese wages were far lower than British wages, they were equivalent to those of Italy and Poland when calculated in gold. However, they have been falling year by year since then. On October 1, 1930, the average working hours in Japanese factories were 9.28 hours, with a weekly working time of 55 to 60 hours.</p>

<p>March 1934     87.8     83.5     94.0     9.50</p>
<p>The sharp drop in the value of the Yen in 1932 and 1933 was a powerful advantage for Japanese exports.</p>

<p>The above two tables can clearly illustrate the exchange rate advantages of Japanese exports since 1932. Because the depreciation of the currency only led to a moderate rise in domestic prices, this export advantage has lasted for several years. Japan, like other countries, has completely transferred the burden of currency inflation to the working class (reducing wages and increasing working hours - see Table 7). The expansion of Japanese trade has stimulated commercial activity, increasing the number of employees and raising the amount of employee compensation, but at the same time lowering the living standards of employees.</p>
<h3>The Effect of Increased Silver Tax and the Surge in Foreign Exchange (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>Perhaps some will say: today's rice prices can no longer be considered low, and farmers in the autumn harvest cannot be said to be without profit. At the same time, the transfer of silver from cities to the interior to trade for agricultural products is, on the one hand, an adjustment of funds for rural areas, and on the other hand, a phenomenon that rural areas should have in terms of economics towards cities. These are indeed facts, and I acknowledge them all. However, the place I'm focusing on is not here, but on the future price of rice. It is commendable that cities can change their past investments in unproductive areas and shift their focus to absorbing agricultural products, so that farmers do not suffer from the "low grain prices hurting farmers." But if today's newly harvested agricultural products are absorbed by merchants and landlords at relatively high market prices, and by next year, when the old crop is exhausted and the new crop is not yet available, it is precisely the time when farmers are preparing to make major investments and start spring planting, and the price of rice rises sharply under the hoarding and monopoly of merchants. Then, wouldn't today's phenomenon simply be creating an act of farmers drinking poison to quench their thirst! Naturally, this is a complex issue; but to simplify it is not really difficult. It only lies in standing on the benefits of the public, making effective control over the future price of rice, and strictly controlling the current stock of domestic rice grains. Today's newspapers are already proclaiming the poor harvest of Japanese rice grains in recent years, setting a record unprecedented in thirty years. Then, merchants are now absorbing rice grains as much as possible, and tomorrow they will export this large batch of white rice abroad; that is a place that should be paid special attention to!</p>
<p>As for the depletion of silver, this is the whole financial problem. The ineffectiveness of increasing the silver export tax and the balancing tax, and the surge in foreign exchange are another problem, but also an equally important problem, which I would like to discuss here.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier: the purpose of increasing the silver export tax and balancing tax is twofold. The first is to prevent silver from flowing out of the country. The second is to stabilize domestic silver prices and foreign exchange rates. But the facts show that neither has achieved satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Since the tax increase, the amount of silver escaping from the country is currently impossible to estimate, and since they are using methods of escape, it is fundamentally impossible to estimate. However, according to reports, the locations for smuggling exports are North and South China. The silver in North China first flows out of the customs and then is transferred to Europe and the United States. The silver in South China is shipped from Hong Kong. Most of the silver that escapes from North and South China flows through Shanghai and other places under the guise of domestic remittances, such as Shanghai remitting to Xiamen first, and then Xiamen remitting to Hong Kong, and then Hong Kong boards ships and sets sail across the ocean. Among those who are in charge of smuggling, there is no shortage of foreign merchants, of course. But if foreign merchants want to load cash for export, it does not seem necessary to go through such a roundabout route. They can simply load the silver into their armored warships with uncomplicated procedures and leave the customs grandly and leisurely. Then, the people who are not afraid of trouble, or have to go through such trouble, are perhaps mostly patriotic Chinese merchants. In this way, the first goal seems to have been shattered. Regardless of today's advocacy of efforts to crack down on smuggling, as the saying goes, "You can only be a thief for a thousand years, but you can't prevent thieves for ten thousand years." What's more, there is the difficulty of not being able to crack down at all. Therefore, simply wanting to prevent outflow is only a passive measure. To truly increase domestic reserves, one can only rely on the improvement of international lending. In a word, only by turning my country's international lending from a deficit to a surplus is the most fundamental solution. But to achieve this goal, one must balance my country's foreign trade. In this way, the management of import and export trade, which the knowledgeable have been advocating, is a necessary measure.</p>
<p>As for the goal of stabilizing domestic silver prices and foreign exchange rates, then we can easily present facts to prove it. If you cannot deny that numbers are absolute truth, then the numbers listed below are the manifestation of this truth.</p>
<p>Recent Seven Weeks' Market Price Fluctuations of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Exchange</p>

<p>Looking at the table above, the foreign silver price, before the tax increase, the highest New York silver price was 55.63 U.S. cents, and the London silver price once opened at 24.88 pence. However, the impact of the tax increase was only enough for three weeks of results. Look, in the week of November 12th to 17th, didn't the silver prices in both places return to the previous records before the tax increase? Moreover, like New York, it has even surpassed it. Even if we say that this is the foreign silver price, our hope is to make the domestic silver price unrelated to the foreign silver price. In other words, to stabilize my country's domestic silver price, then look at the changes in the bullion market, and you will know that the rise and fall of the bullion market price is a reflection of our domestic silver price. Then, heaven knows: the difference between the lowest price of the bullion market in the week after the tax increase and the highest price in the second week after is actually 111.5 yuan. Compared with the highest price in the second week and the lowest price in the third week, there is a difference of 47 yuan. Compared with the lowest price in the fourth week, there is another difference of 54 yuan. By the lowest price in the last week, compared with the previous one, there is another difference of 62 yuan. In short, after the tax increase, the Shanghai bullion did indeed rise sharply once. That is to say, the price of silver in Shanghai has also decreased, but later it still returned to the original trend of cheap gold and expensive silver. Moreover, the intensity of the fluctuations in between cannot be said to be a sign of stable silver prices. Then, the success or failure of the second goal can be imagined.</p>
<p>Perhaps you want to say: the reason we want to stabilize the price of silver is to help stabilize foreign exchange. As shown in the table above, foreign exchange after the tax increase has obviously entered a stable situation. Isn't the work of stabilizing the foreign exchange market already very successful? But if you study it carefully, doesn't the rising trend of foreign exchange still exist? Moreover, with foreign silver prices rising so high, my country's foreign exchange can still barely maintain its balance. Then, how much money has been consumed from the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee's 100 million yuan fund? If you use limited funds to cope with unlimited rising tides, the danger ahead is beyond description.</p>
<p>Therefore, I will finally say: if we only want to follow the footsteps of the great powers in terms of currency, in order to pursue the policy of economic nationalism, and do not use nationalistic means to resist from the general economy; the result is only to work hard and be in vain, and it is useless. If you want to stabilize foreign exchange and prevent silver from flowing out, you can only find a way to balance international lending. In this way, the policy of opening the trade market is not feasible! I have already said in my previous article in this publication, "Review of the Domestic Market in My Country," about the harm of today's opening policy, haven't I? 11.21 (End)</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>The interbank rate still opens at 25% on Sundays</p>
<p>Although yesterday was Sunday and a bank holiday, the silver situation did not show any slight easing. The market price of foreign exchange still remained at 25%, the same as the previous day. In the bill transaction market, morning trades transferred over 2.4 million, with new trades of over 400,000. Afternoon trades amounted to over 600,000. Trades in the Small General Association amounted to over 500,000. Foreign mortgage loan transactions involved redemptions of over 300,000 and new loans of over 500,000. The money shops collected and cleared over 29 million in foreign public bills, with remittances from various routes amounting to over 400,000. As for collections, due to the complete shutdown of bank closures, the situation of auxiliary coins still felt strong. The price of Jiangnan small coins was 840 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, the same as the previous day, with 2,000 coins traded in the morning market and no transactions in the afternoon market. The price of Jiangnan small coins once rose by 2.8 yuan in the morning market, reaching 760 yuan. Although it fell back by a few cents in the afternoon market, to 759.3 yuan, the result was still 2.1 yuan higher than the previous day, with 95,000 coins traded in the morning market and 35,000 coins in the afternoon market. Copper coins were 306,000 wen, an increase of 2,000 wen compared to the previous day, with a transaction volume of 36,720 strings of wen, equivalent to 12,000 yuan in foreign currency.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Large Investors Dump Public Bonds, Worsening the Downtrend</p>
<p>Full week drop of more than one to three yuan</p>
<p>During the week of December 10th to 15th, the public bond market on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was completely under the tight silver situation and the turbulent waves of the Fifth Plenary Session. Dark clouds were gathering, the air was bad, and it seemed that a storm was brewing. The selling by large investors came one after another. This phenomenon was due to the fact that many parties were struggling to develop in the midst of the emergency of the silver situation and after the conference, but the reality did not allow it, leading to a full week of decline. The downtrend started simultaneously with the opening of the conference, and the downtrend did not stop after the closing of the conference. The continuous selling by large investors was naturally related to absorbing cash to protect themselves. Therefore, although the environment was very good, the downtrend did not stop. If this continues, it will inevitably lead to the non-convertibility of paper money. The lack of cash in our country has been due to the import surplus, and it has not started today. Recently, the outflow of cash is still due to the return of prices to their original levels, which is inherent in our country and does not harm it. The inconsistency between cash reserves and the issuance of paper money is the same in all countries, and our country naturally cannot be unique. Following this to the implementation of a non-convertible paper money policy, inflation will be even greater. Therefore, the future of the bond market is very likely to have a sudden reaction due to the excessive number of shorts. For example, on the 16th, there were 7 million shorts for the 4th issue, 5 million shorts for the 40th issue, and the remaining issues such as the 21st, 38th, 43rd, 49th, 53rd, 54th, 11th, and 78th each had 3 to 4 million shorts. The total number is already as high as 70 to 80 million. The multi-party only holds the 4th, 15th, 35th, 41st, and 75th issues, etc., with a total of about 14 to 15 million, and the rest are less than one million. The shorts have goods to deliver in total, and very few will replenish one-third of the short position. Therefore, there is no need to be overly pessimistic about the future. Throughout the past week, there has been a downward trend. On Tuesday, there was a slight rebound, and the highs and lows were uneven. The rest of the week was due to the selling by large investors, and the downtrend could not be stopped. It was especially fierce at the end of the week on Friday and Saturday. The selling by large investors increased every day, and the drop was the greatest on Friday and Saturday. The new low price in the past two months has been found, and the 6th issue is already 6 yuan away from the highest price. It used to be the most fierce uptrend, so its fall is also the greatest. The rumor of issuing new public bonds, even if it is true, will not be realized in the short term. Recently, there is still talk of Mr. Zhantang coming from the north, so if the large investors stop selling slightly, a rebound will be very easy. The market price results for the week showed a uniform drop of more than one to three yuan, except for the slightly slower decline in Jin Chang No. 9, Gong 18, and Customs. The total transaction volume was 111,074,900 yuan, and 27 shares of stocks.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Fluctuations Extremely Slight</h3>
<p>According to the report from Xinfeng Foreign Company, yesterday (15th), except for a few special stocks, the New York stock market's fluctuations were extremely slight, and trading was sluggish. This is because the public is inclined to wait for President Roosevelt's fireside chat. The chaotic actions of American Wireless Radio caused a lot of excitement. A large number of common stocks were dumped, falling to 5 yuan, which is the new low price of the year. However, the two types of preferred stocks, A and B, rose instead, because outside speculators and investors believed that the company's capital reorganization plan might be able to pay off the accumulated arrears of the preferred stocks. It is rumored that the common stocks will issue new stocks, exchanging one new stock for four old stocks. The bond market fluctuated slightly and rose. The small exchange market was stable. Chicago wheat fell due to profit-taking by the bulls. Half-day trading volume was 460,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York indices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Cotton</h3>
<p>American and Indian Cotton Prices Initially Rose and Then Fell Back</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially rose due to the continued validity of the Bankhead Act, which was clearly confirmed, and the public bought actively. However, the national output has not yet been determined. When it rose, the supply of the January and October contracts was quite abundant, so the Southern hedge funds and New Orleans sold out and the price softened.

<p>Jiangxia Rice Market Continues to Show Softness</p>
<p>(Hunan, Shanghai) Yesterday, there were still more than 40 sources from various groups (totaling 7,000 shih of goods), and the sales market was acceptable, the situation was stable, the market color continued to be determined, the price of thick japonica rice was neither good nor bad, and although there were more than 300 packages of late rice purchased by Qingdao and Jinan groups, and another 600-700 packages purchased by the upper merchants, the market price also remained unchanged. Du Yangjian relied on the lack of goods and was flat, and only Yinyuan's route was sluggish, and it alone fell by 1-2 cents.</p>

<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Metal Transactions Only Occurred in the Local Market</p>
<p>Yesterday's metal transactions were exceptionally quiet. The Tianjin gang from out of town had already returned north one after another, and the Henan, Kaifeng, and Xuzhou gangs were also in the process of wrapping up their accounts. Therefore, the market sales, apart from the local market transactions that were still lively, the transactions from out of town could be described as calm. It was found that yesterday, such as tinplate, British copper plates, pointed iron, flat white iron, new iron wire, and black iron sheets, etc., were all opened, but the number was not very large because the end of the year was approaching. Therefore, the total turnover of the city was only more than a thousand dan. As for the market price, British steel plates were slightly higher by 1 cent, selling for 6.7 yuan, and there were few changes in other market prices.</p>

<h3>The Actual Situation of Tangshan Health Facilities (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Deng Licheng</p>
<p>"B" Disease Prevention:</p>
<p>A. Anti-Malaria Work: Malaria is prevalent in this area, with a particularly high number of patients. According to the statistics of investigations and treatments carried out by the institute over the years, malaria patients account for 50%, with children under 15 being the most numerous. Tertian malaria is the most common, followed by malignant malaria and quartan malaria. In the autumn of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the National Health Administration sent personnel to work with the institute on a large-scale anti-malaria campaign and to improve all environmental sanitation facilities.</p>
<p>B. Vaccination: In February of last year, the institute held a vaccination campaign. In addition, children in all schools in the area are vaccinated once every spring and autumn. Outpatient services, mobile medical care, and home visits also added to the vaccination work.</p>
<p>C. Preventive Injections: Typhoid and cholera preventive injections are given every summer. In February of this year, an epidemic of meningitis occurred in Shidi Village in the town, and many people were infected for a time. In addition to opening a new ward for accommodation and treatment, the institute also conducted mobile investigations and preventive injections. It was soon eradicated before it could spread.</p>
<p>"C" School Health:</p>
<p>There are 16 villages in the area, with more than 40 schools and over 1,000 students. At the beginning of the establishment of the health center, school health work began. At that time, only Tangshan Elementary School and Xianjianqiao Elementary School were handled. Later, it gradually increased. Now there are 14 schools handling school health. The names of the schools are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Tangshan Elementary School, Tangshan Town</p>
<p>(2) Xianjianqiao Elementary School, 5 li from Tangshan</p>
<p>(3) Zuochang Elementary School, 5 li from Tangshan</p>
<p>(4) Xincun Elementary School, 12 li from Tangshan</p>
<p>(5) Sizhuang Elementary School, 12 li from Tangshan</p>
<p>(6) Houjiatang Elementary School, 9 li from Tangshan</p>
<p>(7) Chenjiazhuang Elementary School, 12 li from Tangshan</p>
<p>(8) Yancheng Elementary School, 5 li from Tangshan</p>
<p>(9) Sizhuang Elementary School, 2 li from Tangshan</p>
<p>(10) Xitou Elementary School, 8 li from Tangshan</p>
<p>(11) Shangcaocun Elementary School, 5 li from Tangshan</p>
<p>(12) Yinjiabian Elementary School, 5 li from Tangshan</p>
<p>(13) Mengjiachang Elementary School, 15 li from Tangshan</p>
<p>(14) Shangzhuang Elementary School, 20 li from Tangshan</p>
<p>School health work includes conducting physical examinations of students at the beginning of each semester, as well as other preventive injections and vaccinations. Each school has a health room, and a public health nurse is responsible for taking turns to each school every day to implement the following school health work:</p>
<p>(1) Defect Correction: Defects found after physical examinations are corrected, such as trachoma and skin diseases.</p>
<p>(2) Cleanliness Inspection: Each school has a health team organized and trained by students. The student health team is responsible for the cleanliness inspection of the school and students. It is carried out once a day, under the guidance and supervision of the nurse in charge of school health, to cultivate children's hygiene habits and the spirit of health self-government.</p>
<p>(3) Health Lectures: Using simple materials, such as health knowledge and health stories, to instill health knowledge in children.</p>
<p>(4) Parent-Teacher Conferences: The school authorities and the health center jointly convene student parent-teacher conferences. The purpose of the conferences is to instill health knowledge in student parents so that they pay attention to children's health. Various hygiene products, such as handkerchiefs and toothbrushes, are also given away, which are passed on to the children by the student parents.</p>
<p>"D" Maternal and Child Health:</p>
<p>There is no new method of delivery in the town, so women's childbirth is handled by midwives. As a result, the infant mortality rate is particularly high, and it is not uncommon for mothers to have their lives endangered by puerperal fever. At the beginning of the establishment of the health center, it attached great importance to maternal and child health, and made special efforts in home visits and midwifery work. I have also accompanied the midwives of the institute on home visits many times, and I deeply feel that in today's budding health undertakings in China, this kind of practical rural maternal and child health care work is very important, and the spirit of loyal service of the midwives of the institute is particularly rare. The details of their work are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Prenatal Examination: Women in rural areas think that it is a shameful thing to seek medical examination during pregnancy, so there are very few outpatient prenatal examinations, and most of them are carried out by midwives during home visits. However, it must be done with good intentions and persuasion in order to achieve the goal. In addition, hygiene during pregnancy is also guided accordingly.</p>
<p>(2) Midwifery Work: In order to popularize the new method of delivery and reduce the mortality rate of infants and mothers, the institute provides free delivery regardless of day or night. Baby clothes are also given away to encourage them. According to the statistics of the institute, since its opening, it has delivered more than one hundred and ten births.</p>
<p>(3) Visiting Postpartum Families: On the second day after delivery, Zou will make home visits to bathe the baby and handle matters for the mother. After that, visit once every three or four months or a week to instruct on hygiene during the puerperium and infant care methods.</p>
<p>(4) Pre-School Children's Health</p>
<p>1. Mother's Meeting and Children's Meeting: Every Saturday afternoon, mother's meetings and children's meetings are held in the exhibition room of the health center, presided over by public health nurses or midwives. The purpose is to instill various health knowledge and cultivate children's hygiene habits.</p>
<p>2. Children's Health Competition: A children's health competition for children under six years old is held, and prizes are awarded to those with excellent results, including various hygiene products and children's toys. The value of the prizes ranges from one to five or six yuan in national currency. The children's health competition is held every six months. The purpose is to arouse women's attention to children's upbringing.</p>
<p>"E" Environmental Sanitation</p>
<p>(1) Drinking Water Disinfection: The people in the area mostly draw drinking water from wells. In addition to modifying and regularly disinfecting the original wells, the health center also built a disinfected reservoir in Xujiabian Village, about one li from Tangshan Town, which can hold 950 gallons, using pond water as a source of water. People are sent from the health center to draw water twice a day, which can supply the village with 200 people's daily drinking water.</p>
<p>(2) Bathroom Improvement: Tangshan has hot springs that are very suitable for bathing, so there are more bathrooms in the town than in other villages and towns. Except for a few aristocratic commercial bathrooms, the remaining public bathrooms for men and women are not clean, and the buildings are too simple and unsanitary. The health center cooperated with the local government of the town this summer to improve them. The content of water changing and ventilation is more thorough than before.</p>
<p>(3) Construction of Public Toilets: In addition to improving the original toilets, Javanese-style public toilets for men and women were built opposite the Tangshan Bus Station.</p>
<p>(4) Garbage Disposal: The town has multiple garbage bins set up by the health center to collect garbage from shops and residents in the town, which are filled in ditches or incinerated for disposal. In addition, the construction of vegetable markets and the disposal of private feces are being carried out by the health center in cooperation with local authorities.</p>
<p>"F" Health Propaganda: Health propaganda is the first step in promoting health work. In addition to the exhibition of health exhibitions, health posters, and health talks for home visits in the exhibition room, the institute also has outpatient waiting room health education and mobile medical health lectures, both of which instill simple and easy-to-implement health knowledge and habits while patients are waiting for treatment. In addition, there is a health bulletin board in front of the health center, and there are fixed health slogans on the walls along the way from Tangshan Town to Houjiatang.</p>
<p>"G" Vital Statistics: Since its establishment, the health center has been handling birth and death statistics in the area, which has achieved great results. Recently, it has also been jointly handled with the local government of Tangshan Town.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Tangshan's health undertakings have a considerable history and achievements. However, in our country with a vast area and 400 million people, when the wealth and strength of the entire nation and the soundness of society and the economy and security are in imminent danger, medical and health facilities are particularly important. I hope that our colleagues in the medical field will promote them.</p>
<p>Finally, I sincerely thank Dr. He Dingyao, the director of the Tangshan Health Office, and all the other comrades for their enthusiastic leadership in leading me to visit various places, so that I can complete this survey.</p>

<h3>Common Treatment Methods for Fever (12)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>(1) When the body initially feels slightly uncomfortable, if a doctor confirms that it is typhoid fever, you should immediately go to bed and rest quietly. Bowel movements should also be done in bed. Rest should be both physical and mental, that is, the body should be in bed, and the mind should also be completely rested, because this is a serious disease.</p>
<p>(2) Diet: Proper diet is the most important thing for treating typhoid fever, and all other treatments are secondary. Therefore, great attention should be paid to the patient's diet. The following two points should be noted for diet: (1) You must know that there are some small sores in the small intestine of typhoid fever patients. Coarse food and indigestible food passing through these sores can easily cause the sores to break and bleed. If a lot of blood flows, there is a very high risk of life. If these sores are broken through by coarse food residue, it is even a nine-out-of-ten chance of survival. Coarse and渣containing foods such as green vegetables, all fruits, and hard rice cannot be eaten. What you need to eat is no渣, thin, soft and easy to digest. (2) This article has detailed the food needed by patients. When the fever is high, a patient needs about 3,000 calories per day, that is, the nutrients needed by a patient per day are equal to those of a farmer working in the field. Therefore, the amount eaten by the patient should also be equal to that of a hard-working farmer. However, patients cannot eat the same things as ordinary people. Patients can eat and drink once every two hours except when sleeping, several times each time. The following is a list of the types of food and the amount of each time. Give him a proper diet according to the patient's condition.</p>
<p>One cup of milk, half a bowl of soy milk, one egg with boiling water, one bowl of rice soup with one spoonful of sugar, one bowl of noodle soup with one spoonful of sugar, one bowl of lotus root powder soup with one spoonful of sugar, one soft steamed egg, half a cup of fruit water, such as orange water, grape juice, or fruit露, two pieces of white fine bread, one large spoonful of fruit jam, two pieces of soft-boiled yam, half a cup of each of milk酪脂, one bowl of various green vegetable soup, and two large spoonfuls of ice cream at a time. The above various foods can be properly allocated according to the patient's economic situation, body size, gender, and age. This is the most important part of treating typhoid fever.</p>
<p>(3) Treatment of High Fever: It is not necessary to use antipyretic methods for temperatures below 103 degrees (39 degrees on the Celsius scale). Above this limit, hydrotherapy can be used to reduce fever (details of various methods are described earlier). In short, the treatment method for temperatures below 105 degrees is: (1) Put a cold wet cloth垫 on the forehead. (2) Wrap the body in a wet sheet. (3) Wash the body two or three times a day. (4) Fresh air in the ward should be circulated at all times. If the temperature is 105 degrees or above, in addition to the above method, add the water spraying antipyretic method, half-body bath and full-body bath (details of the method are described earlier).</p>
<p>(4) Treatment of Intestinal Bleeding: Sores in the intestines of typhoid fever patients sometimes break and bleed. If there is a lot of bleeding, there is an immediate danger to life. Approximately one in ten people with typhoid fever have intestinal bleeding. This accidental danger can be reduced if treated properly, and the danger is doubled if not treated properly. The symptoms of intestinal bleeding are roughly as follows: the patient's stool is black or has blood clots, the patient's face suddenly turns bluish-white, the limbs are cold, and the pulse is fast, thin, and weak.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Renzhen</p>
<p>(28) Pharyngeal Diphtheria (commonly known as Diphtheria) (Continued)</p>
<p>(3) Nasal Diphtheria Nasendiphtherie</p>
<p>Nasal diphtheria mostly occurs secondary to pharyngeal diphtheria. Primary nasal diphtheria is generally relatively rare. This disease also mostly affects children, even infants. When suffering from nasal diphtheria, most of the nasal cavity is blocked first. Soon the nasal secretions gradually increase. The nature of the secretions is initially serous, and then becomes bloody purulent. The outer mouth of the nostril and the skin of the upper lip are often red due to frequent刺戟 of secretions. Necrotic fragments separated from the inflamed nasal mucosa are repeatedly discharged to the outside together with nasal mucus. If a nasal speculum is used to examine the nasal cavity, the nasal cavity can be seen to be filled with grayish-white necrotic tissue. Nasal diphtheria is also a disease that cannot be taken lightly, and it can often turn into systemic sepsis or die from衰脱. Although his fever often rises to around 38 degrees, sometimes there is no increase in body temperature at all. In addition to having a stuffy nose and runny nose, the child also has no other significant painful phenomena. Therefore, parents do not care much and do not suspect that it is nasal diphtheria. It was not until after a long time that it had not been cured that they sought treatment from a doctor. I will now give an example of a case with this situation to prove it. Reading it may increase some interest.</p>
<p>Medical Record No. 985 (Nasal) Examination Date: November 6, 23rd year</p>
<p>Name: Cheng Mou, Male, 8 years old, Resident of Wudingfang, Wuding Road, this port</p>
<p>History of the onset of the disease: According to Yun, the nasal cavity has been blocked for four days and there is a lot of nasal mucus, and it often bleeds, especially in the right nasal cavity. The right side of the face was once swollen, but now it has subsided slightly. There is no cold or fever.</p>
<p>Examination Findings: There is a slight bloody secretion at the entrance of the left nasal cavity. The mucous membrane of the right nasal cavity is clearly swollen and filled with grayish-white necrotic tissue. It is not easy to peel off. If it is forcibly peeled off, it will easily bleed. The outer mouth of the nostril is slightly eroded.</p>
<p>Microscopic Examination: A small amount of secretions were collected from the right nasal cavity and sent to Dr. Zhu Yanggao for examination. The result was that diphtheria bacilli were found (report number is 4337).</p>
<p>Diagnosis Result: Confirmed as nasal diphtheria.</p>
<p>Treatment History: 10,000 units of diphtheria antitoxin were immediately injected. On the third day after the injection, the grayish-white necrotic tissue filling the right nasal cavity had already peeled off by itself, so it was very easy to remove (it was a long block). The swelling of the mucous membrane also subsided, and nasal breathing also recovered.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Xiangshan Sanatorium in Beiping</h3>
<p>— Guo Meisun</p>
<p>Origin: In 1933 of the Western calendar, the Beiping Women's Branch of the Chinese Red Cross stated that the number of people suffering from tuberculosis in our country is several times that of European and American countries, and there is no corresponding treatment for nineteen, allowing them to be eliminated freely, which is not the phenomenon that should exist in modern scientific enlightenment. Even if one or two sanatoriums have been established in Beiping recently, they cannot overcome the feeling of "a drop in the bucket". Tuberculosis is originally a preventable disease. If patients can seek medical treatment early and have adequate care and guidance, almost all of them can recover. The colleagues in the society, in view of this, immediately started to reorganize the old site of the Yinshan Xiangshan Hospital of the society into a sanatorium hospital for accommodating patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and training special nurses for pulmonary tuberculosis. In September of this year, they started work, admitted patients, and opened classes to train nurse students.</p>
<p>Equipment: At that time, due to various difficulties in economy and talent, coupled with the lack of sanatoriums for female patients, only 20 beds were set up specifically for accommodating female patients. Soon, at the request of all circles, several male wards were opened separately. Recently, the buildings in the hospital have been rearranged and modified. Currently, there are 50 first, second, and third-class male and female patient beds. In the future, if the wards are fully occupied, they will be expanded again, in order to have one or two hundred to several hundred beds.</p>
<p>There is a laboratory in the hospital, specializing in all kinds of examinations. In addition, there are also operating rooms, outpatient clinics, pharmacies, etc. Every day, neighboring villagers and students from Xiangshan Ciyouyuan come to the hospital for treatment. This is also the only step to instill new medical techniques into the countryside. The hospital also has its own modern equipment such as electric lights, electric bells, tap water, steam stoves, and Western-style toilets, so that patients living there will not feel behind in rural affairs.</p>
<p>Doctors, Nurses, and Staff: There are currently two resident doctors in the hospital, one of whom is a graduate of Beiping Xiehe Hospital. At the same time, experts in tuberculosis and surgery from Xiehe Hospital come to the hospital on time to discuss various medical records and treatment plans with the doctors. Patients who need surgical treatment can also undergo surgery at the same time, saving patients the trouble of traveling back and forth to the city for medical treatment. The nursing work is undertaken by three graduate nurses, eight nursing students, and 20 staff members. In addition, the hospital also employs a vocational guidance instructor, who specializes in guiding patients to learn various handicrafts, so as to help patients pass the monotonous and boring years. This is unique to the hospital and is an innovation of the hospital.</p>
<p>Environment: The hospital site is an ancient temple, with undulating palaces, staggered pavilions, and connected corridors, like a rainbow after rain, and the circular road spirals like a snake and a dragon. Rainbow pines and cypresses, ancient trees towering into the sky, secluded forests and valleys, gurgling springs, fresh air, suitable climate, and excellent scenery. Living in this hospital is not only refreshing, but also suitable for the recuperation of pulmonary tuberculosis. Moreover, it is surrounded by mountains and faces water, warm in winter and cool in summer. Looking west, the glazed ancient pagoda and Biyun Temple are dazzling; peeping east, the beautiful scenery of Longevity Hill and Yuquan is wonderful; looking at the mountains nearby and the old capital in the distance, it is no different from a paradise.</p>
<p>Transportation: In terms of transportation, there are four public buses to and from the hospital gate every day. During the summer when there are more tourists, several additional temporary vehicles are added. The Xiangshan Post Office and Telegraph Office are also nearby, making it very convenient to send and receive telegrams. The hospital is also equipped with a telephone (Xiangshan No. 13) for communication with Shanghai.</p>
<p>Admission Procedures: In order to facilitate patients' contact, the hospital has specially agreed with the tuberculosis科 or "A克斯"ray科 of Beiping Dongcheng, Xiehe Hospital; Dasheng Hospital on West Chang'an Street; Women and Children's Hospital in Xiaoshun Hutong, and Shoushan Hospital on Fuqian Street in advance. Anyone who wishes to be admitted to the hospital can be directly introduced to the hospital by experts from the above hospitals or the Beiping Women's Branch of the Chinese Red Cross on Shifuma Street, Xicheng. The Beiping Municipal Health Bureau and Xiehe Hospital's ambulance can also provide pick-up and drop-off services.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (33)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Clinical Examination Methods</p>
<p>(4) Blood Tests</p>
<p>Blood tests for pulmonary tuberculosis are far less valuable for diagnosis than identifying tubercle bacilli in sputum. Therefore, most doctors do not consider them very important, and patients are even more confused about their purpose. Indeed, its report is far less specialized than the identification of tubercle bacilli. The findings regarding blood images are neither as clear-cut as in leukemia nor as widely applicable as in several acute infectious diseases. All of these factors easily lead to neglect. However, according to recent research, changes in the number of red blood cells and hemoglobin are indeed of little significance. As for the status of white blood cell types and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, they are relevant to a true understanding of the disease and indirectly contribute significantly to diagnosis. The details of this are described below:</p>
<p>Many patients with pulmonary tuberculosis have pale complexions, often exhibiting symptoms of common anemia. This has already been mentioned in the previous Chapter 7! Therefore, the number of red blood cells and hemoglobin levels are generally reduced. However, this change is not inevitable. Moreover, the number of red blood cells and hemoglobin levels do not always change in perfect unison. Sometimes hemoglobin levels may be reduced while the number of red blood cells remains unchanged. This is often the case in many advanced stages of the disease. Common anemia also tends to show this pattern. Conversely, this change is not necessarily found in severe cases. Sometimes it happens right at the beginning of the disease. In addition, it should be mentioned that severe anemia is often found when complications such as bleeding and intestinal tuberculosis occur. We give a special term to the condition of red blood cells and hemoglobin: "red blood picture." It does not provide much help in diagnosing the disease. In contrast, there is the "white blood picture," which refers to the condition of "white blood cells" described below.</p>
<p>The changes in white blood cells that are valuable in disease diagnosis are divided into two aspects. The first is the increase or decrease in number, and the second is the differentiation of types. In normal blood, white blood cells are divided into five types: polymorphonuclear leukocytes, large mononuclear leukocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes. Each type accounts for a certain percentage of the total number of white blood cells, according to statistical data. Regarding the first aspect, the increase or decrease in number, there is no significant change in this disease. It is almost the same as in normal people. As for the differentiation of types, previously, attention was only paid to the increase or decrease in lymphocytes, which is, of course, not very valuable. According to recent research by Schilling, the above five categories are considered insufficient. He further divides polymorphonuclear leukocytes into four subcategories based on the different shapes of their nuclei: myelocytes, juvenile cells, band cells, and segmented neutrophils. Among these, myelocytes and juvenile cells are generally absent in normal blood. The number of band cells is less than that of segmented neutrophils, roughly in a ratio of 1:15. Usually, with infectious contact, the number of immature cell types will increase. Therefore, for the differentiation of white blood cell types, these four subcategories should be counted simultaneously in order to understand the true situation. Regarding the results of counting these, I will now describe only the two types that are valuable in diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis. The first type is an increase in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, where juvenile cells and myelocytes are found, and the number of band cells also increases. In addition, the number of large mononuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes decreases, and eosinophils may sometimes be absent. The second type is a decrease in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (the number of subcategories also decreases simultaneously), an increase in lymphocytes and large mononuclear leukocytes, and the number of eosinophils remains the same. Reports of chronic infectious diseases generally fall between these two. Taking this disease alone, the only recognizable feature is an increase in band cells and a decrease in lymphocytes. Reports of common malignant tumors show a roughly similar increase in the number of subcategories, but the number of lymphocytes increases. In syphilis, the number of lymphocytes decreases similarly, but there are no significant changes in the subcategories. These differentiations seem too subtle, and even many doctors easily overlook them. In fact, they are of great help in diagnosis. Even the current condition of the disease can sometimes be inferred from them.</p>
<h3>A General Overview of Malaria</h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaolan</p>
<p>A Brief History of Malaria</p>
<p>Ancient Western physicians mostly attributed malaria to poor climate or evaporation from swamps and polluted water. Hence, the name "Malaria" (from Italian "bad air") or "Sumpffieber" (German "swamp fever"). Torti first used the term "Malaria" in 1753, and Macculloch introduced it into British medical books in 1827. Going back to ancient times, as early as 490-377 BC, the medical sage Hippocrates recognized malaria as an important endemic disease and distinguished three types: quotidian, tertian, and quartan. At that time, Italy, Greece, and other tropical and humid regions had long been prevalent. It was not until the 17th century that Sydrnham stated that it occurred based on certain seasonal and climatic factors.</p>
<p>In 1880, the French physician Laveran discovered malaria parasites in the blood cells of malaria patients. Subsequent research by Celli, Marchiafava, and others confirmed that it was the causative agent of malaria. In 1886, the Italian physician Golgi explored the development of quartan malaria parasites and clarified that its new developmental stage coincided with the onset of malaria. In 1894, Manson suggested that since filariasis was transmitted by mosquitoes, mosquitoes might also be the host of malaria parasites. In 1895, the British physician Ronald Ross proved that mosquitoes infected with malaria parasites and stated that malaria transmission was based on the bites of anopheles mosquitoes. In the same year, the Italian physician Grossi proved that Anopheles mosquitoes were the vector of human malaria. Thus, the transmission route of malaria was also clarified.</p>
<p>In 1639, the Countess of Delehinchon of Spain was cured of malaria in Peru with cinchona bark. In 1820, Pelletier and Cavertou extracted its important component, quinine, which was even more effective in treating malaria. Later, Ehrlich used methylene blue, and Uhlmann used neosalvarsan. French-made Quinetum, Swiss-made 303 (Peraerine) all had considerable efficacy. In 1925, Schulemann and others developed Plasmochin, and in 1930, Mietzsch and others developed Atabrine, making malaria treatment even more comprehensive. Since 1899, Koch distinguished three types of malaria parasites and established malaria prevention strategies. In 1928, the Health Organization of the League of Nations published malaria prevention guidelines. In the past, malaria was only regarded as a medical problem, but now it has evolved from a social problem to an international problem.</p>
<p>Records of Malaria in Chinese Classics</p>
<p>Malaria was discovered very early in China. Sou Shen Ji records that a son of Emperor Zhuanxu died and became a malaria ghost. Although this statement is absurd, it shows that malaria was prevalent before history. Moreover, the Su Wen (Simple Questions) discusses malaria in great detail. The Shuowen Jiezi (Explaining Simple and Analyzing Compound Characters) uses the three characters "nue" (瘧), "jie" (痎), and "pi" (痞) to distinguish its symptoms, indicating that it was extremely common in ancient times. At that time, science had not yet flourished, and the cause of the disease was explored based on speculation. Those who emphasized climate were found in the Book of Changes, Zhou Li (Rites of Zhou) Tian Guan Ji Yi (Officials of Heaven, Medical Practitioners), Lüshi Chunqiu (Master Lü's Spring and Autumn Annals) Yue Ling Pian (Monthly Ordinances), and Su Wen Nue Lun (Simple Questions on Malaria). Those who emphasized diet were found in Zhang Ji's Jin Gui Yao Lue (Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber), Liu Dingsu's Liu Shu, and Zhu Zhenheng's Xin Fa (Heart Method). Those who emphasized the Five Elements were found in Zhao Xianke's Yi Guan. Those who emphasized ghosts and gods were found in the Zuo Zhuan (Zuo Commentary) Qi Hou Jie Sui Dian Zhang (Duke Qi's Scabies and Malaria Chapter) and the legends of malaria ghosts in the Lie Yi Zhuan (Biographies of Strange Encounters), Lu Yi Zhuan (Further Biographies of Strange Encounters), and Zhen Yi Zhuan (Authentic Biographies of Strange Encounters). Various arguments emerged, and no consensus was reached.</p>
<p>Since the cause of malaria was not determined, medical books throughout history classified it based on its symptoms. The Su Wen stated that "cold followed by heat" was cold malaria, "heat followed by cold" was heat malaria, and "only heat without cold" was dan malaria. Chao Yuanfang's Bing Yuan (Origins of Diseases) had the theory of the five zang malaria: liver malaria, heart malaria, spleen malaria, lung malaria, and kidney malaria. Li Gao's Shi Shu (Ten Books) divided it into the six meridians malaria: Taiyang malaria, Shaoyang malaria, Yangming malaria, Taiyin malaria, Shaoyin malaria, and Jueyin malaria. In addition, there were more names given according to the private opinions of a few, such as ghost malaria, female malaria, damp malaria, miasma malaria, epidemic malaria, stomach malaria, food malaria, consumptive malaria, as malaria, old malaria, mother malaria, chronic malaria, phlegm malaria, post-dysentery malaria, blood malaria, fetal malaria, night malaria, collapse malaria, wind malaria, warm malaria, postpartum malaria, and yin malaria. From a modern perspective, these are completely worthless. Only the Jin Gui Yao Lue's statement that "prolonged filtration can lead to malaria mother" clarifies the relationship between splenomegaly and malaria and is a very insightful study.</p>
<p>As for the methods of treating malaria, they can be summarized into four types: (1) acupuncture, as seen in the Su Wen Ci Nue Ji (Simple Questions on Acupuncture for Malaria); (2) guidance exercises, as seen in Xie Guan's Zhong Yi Ci Dian (Dictionary of Traditional Chinese Medicine) Nue Zhu (Malaria Annotation); (3) incantations, as seen in Zhang Congzheng's Ru Men Shi Qin Zhou Guo Fa (Confucian Family Matters Incantation Method). The above three methods were quite popular in ancient times due to the simplicity of people's lives. (4) Herbal medicine. For treatment based on symptoms, Chai Hu was used for excess syndrome, and Ginseng and Atractylodes were used for deficiency syndrome. Cinnamon twig and Notopterygium were used for cold symptoms, Ephedra was used for those without sweating, Fritillaria and Pinellia were used for those with phlegm, and Saposhnikovia and Kudzu were used for those with wind. Artemisia and枳實 were used for latent summer dampness. Most of these were ineffective. The method of administering drugs such as Dichroa febrifuga, Amomum tsao-ko, and Arsenolite before the onset to prevent it from occurring was called intercepting malaria, which was similar to scientific treatment. Unfortunately, most doctors followed the theories of climate and yin and yang and emphasized treatment based on symptoms, abandoning it, which is truly regrettable.</p>

<h3>The Great Harmony (Datong) Ideal</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Henderson, the chairman of the League of Nations Disarmament Conference, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, truly deserves to be called a world "god of peace." This old man recently gave a speech at Vauxhall University entitled "The Basic Conditions for Universal and Permanent Peace in the World," strongly advocating the establishment of the United States of the World. He first said: If aliens from another planet were to land on this Earth, they would feel extremely surprised. Because all countries on Earth verbally praise peace, but in fact, they are actively preparing for war. On the one hand, starving people fill the roads, while elsewhere, rice and grain are discarded in streams and ditches. The most frustrating thing about this situation is that the countries responsible for convening the Disarmament Conference are still competing to increase their armaments today. He concluded by saying that if countries are prepared to organize a world economic association, then such an organization would be the first step in establishing the United States of the World. From this perspective, Mr. Henderson is not only a pacifist but also an advocate of the Great Harmony ideal.</p>
<p>The Great Harmony of the World is the highest ideal of mankind. However, this ideal is still far from reality and cannot be realized in a short period of time. Because the present world is one of the survival of the fittest, selfishness, and contradictions. In such a world, what mankind manifests is only the various evils of killing, oppression, bullying, and contention. This world is not only as described by Mr. Henderson, that if aliens from another planet were to land here, they would feel extremely surprised. I am afraid that even we who live in this world would have to express surprise at it.</p>
<p>The factual world at present is indeed like this: on the one hand, some people are shouting for peace, while on the other hand, some people are calling for war. On the one hand, starving people fill the roads, while on the other hand, food is discarded in streams and ditches. What kind of phenomenon is this? If this phenomenon is not eliminated one day, the world will never change, and the Great Harmony ideal, the highest ideal of mankind, will never be realized.</p>
<p>However, human thought is always progressing. Although today's world is a dark world, the forces of darkness will never be able to block the human pursuit of light. Therefore, we believe that the Great Harmony of the World will one day be realized.</p>
<p>However, to realize the ideal of the Great Harmony, as Mr. Henderson said, "If countries are prepared to organize a world economic association, then such an organization would be the first step in establishing the United States of the World." This is only a superficial view. It will only be effective if mankind can remove its selfishness and narrow-mindedness. Otherwise, all formal organizations will ultimately fail to achieve their goals.</p>
<h3>Winter Solstice</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>The Winter Solstice has arrived among the withered maple leaves, but even in Wujia Town, with its hundred-plus households, it is as lifeless as withered maple leaves. The sun is faint, and the gold-lettered black signboard of Dexiang Grocery Store is swaying at the entrance. There are three or four hurried pedestrians on the street, and a black dog is sleeping like it’s dead in the sunlight on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>The owner of Dexiang Grocery Store, a big fat man, has fleshy wrinkles on his face, forming a permanently lingering smile. Whenever a customer comes in, he always greets them with a hearty laugh, and his attitude is very kind. Moreover, he occupies an important position in this market, so in just a few years, this grocery store that sells a little bit of everything, including various kinds of cigarettes, has leapt to become the leading general merchandise store in Wujia Town. The storefront has also expanded from half a narrow alley to a very decent shop. The counter is newly installed and lacquered red. In the morning, the sunlight shines on the entire shop, and passersby stand in front of his door for a while. The owner's smile is visible across the counter, and he chats about "idle talk." If it is an old and familiar customer, he hands them a cigarette and pours them a cup of tea, which is a common occurrence. A cabinet is placed against the wall, with many drawers. He divides dried shrimp and red dates very clearly. It seems like he packs them casually, but he never makes a mistake. So when he talks about the abdication of the Xuantong Emperor, he often forgets the closing time. However, he always refuses to replace the mottled signboard of Dexiang Grocery Store with a new one. He says, "A gentleman does not forget his origins!"</p>
<p>Now this signboard is swaying again. The owner flipped through his ledger for a long time before pulling out a big purse. That smile still lingered, but it was like the sky during the plum rain season, making people feel annoyed. He saw the black dog sleeping on the sidewalk, and perhaps for the first time in his life, he got angry. He raised a feather duster and angrily swatted the scrawny dog's legs twice. The black dog seemed to wake up from a dream, barking "woof, woof," while turning its head to look at the owner's smile. The owner raised the feather duster even higher, and the black dog got up in confusion, glancing back at the corner of the street.</p>
<p>The owner put down the feather duster, seeming to feel much lighter. He held his head with both hands, his narrow eyes staring at every passerby. He hoped someone would come in, even if they didn't buy anything, just to talk. He had a belly full of grievances to tell clearly, but there were few passersby, and they were all hurrying. He seemed to be dreaming, flipping through the calendar hanging on the wall, while counting on his fingers.</p>
<p>"Oh, today is the 18th, tomorrow is the 19th, the day after tomorrow…the day after the day after tomorrow, huh! Isn't that the Winter Solstice?"</p>
<p>Although it was a soliloquy, it was close to scolding someone. The voice was loud, but without an opponent, the owner was always full of grievances. So he thought of the year when he installed the new storefront (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Memories</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>If you recall many old things from the past, whether</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>they are sweet or sad, there is always pain when you recall them. But the more you fear it, the more it seems to deliberately interfere and become close to you. As long as your mind is slightly quiet and you close your eyes for a moment, memories will flood your mind and occupy your entire thoughts. Therefore, almost every day is spent in melancholy memories.</p>
<p>It is a blessing if one can forget everything from the past, but few can enjoy this blessing. People are ultimately emotional and have the function of thinking. They always like to talk about past events or think about them. In this way, some annoyances and some disappointments will always entangle them. In fact, no matter what happened in the past, it can never be retrieved. It is already done. Sometimes you know it clearly, but you still willingly put yourself into a kind of unfounded distress. If you say that you once had a light dream, a day of dreamlike beauty, or a beautiful love affair, but these have been buried by the footprints of time. All the dreams woven with embroidery have been shattered by the stones of reality, and your body has also been pushed into an adverse environment. While gritting your teeth and fighting with the current cruel encounters, you also often recall the gilded days of the past. As a result, the pain is even more increased. Why was it like that in the past, and why is it like this now? Thinking like this, sometimes you will simply lose all interest in being a human being. Memories only make people feel discouraged and disappointed. There is nothing else good about them. If you used to live a very superior life and now you are living a very miserable life, then memories will not only make you suffer endless pain, but may even make you feel that the meaning of life is too weak. However, it is possible that memories can also give people a kind of comfort in different situations, but this comfort is not about reviewing all the previous successful things and carefully savoring them. The result is only pain, and there is absolutely no comfort. To have a kind of comfort caused by memories, it is best not to think about those successful things. It is best to put the successful things aside and think about some unsatisfactory things, and say to yourself, "The days of the past were not necessarily more comfortable than now. Maybe the days of now are more comfortable than those of the past. The little bit of hardship that I am suffering now is nothing compared to the past." If you can explain it in this way, you will get more or less comfort from memories. However, there are very few such people. From time to time, you see some people with old faces, sighing and saying: "I used to be like this and like that, but now I have come to this point. Thinking about it, I really don't want to live anymore." In reality, you should always move in a good direction. If you accidentally encounter bad things and cannot extricate yourself, you may not even be able to be a human being. Therefore, to reduce all kinds of unnecessary worries, you must first liberate your emotions, see through everything, and not think that something will always be like that and will never change. This is impossible. If you say that you are living a good life now, but such a life cannot be maintained for a long time, then you should think that bad days will come one day. And when those bad days really come, you can live peacefully and not care about it at all. The joys and sorrows of the world are constantly changing. Not everyone will enjoy happiness all their lives, and not everyone will suffer all their lives. It is naturally lucky to have time to enjoy happiness, but there is no need to worry about its short existence. Even if you worry, it is in vain. In the same way, there is no need to cry out when suffering, as long as you keep your eyes open, deal with any situation, and have a plan for yourself. As for memories, they are originally a common instinct of everyone, but when you think of the past, it should be completely different from the present reality. Do not grab them together to make a comparison. Otherwise, you will cause trouble, and this is exactly self-inflicted.</p>
<h3>Squares and Circles</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ying</p>
<p>Dancing seems to be a fashionable thing, so dance halls are constantly being created.</p>
<p>No, you can't say that. It's not just fashionable, but it also has a fitness aspect. If you dance a bit after work or after dinner, you can enjoy it and let the fatigue of the whole day slide away under the interplay of leather shoes and the floor.</p>
<p>However, there is a fascination in dance halls. People who step inside are often "mesmerized" and lose their sense of direction and time, circling around and around without being able to get out.</p>
<p>Although this causes considerable harm to the spirit and career of tourists, it is not necessary to worry about it.</p>
<p>Originally, in the clanging of music, in the reflection of red lights and green wine, in the intoxicating laughter, who would bother to worry about anything else?</p>
<p>Many people say: "Life is too boring and too ordinary." Some people also say: "It's too mechanized and has lost the fun of living." So, they are very discouraged and very frustrated.</p>
<p>Indeed, this seems to be an unsolvable mystery. When a person goes from birth to childhood, to adulthood, and then to old age, the process, although it may take decades, is probably because time passes too quickly, and it slips away so lightly in just a moment.</p>
<p>When you are striding along, the situation is indeed a bit too boring. Every day, you get up, eat, and sleep. Even in the office, the feeling is good enough, signing in, working, and getting off work. There is no change, regardless of winter or summer. People are like the wheels and axles in a machine, rolling and rolling.</p>
<p>It is said that the reason why people can be established is that they should accept this ordinary tempering.</p>
<p>Working in an institution, there are relatively many tasteless social interactions. Now that there is a recession, social interaction is best done with cash, giving it a boost, so that both parties benefit.</p>
<p>However, whenever you dig cash out of your pocket, weighing the snow-white silver dollars, they are quite heavy. Wow, this is the price of sweat and labor! Unconsciously, you have to estimate the time. Isn't it true that in a few more days, it will be payday again? But no, the family still needs household expenses. There is no way, borrow from friends.</p>
<p>When you receive your salary, you look at the amount on the envelope, open it, and what do you get? Besides the public share, meal expenses, donation rate, and ×× that have been deducted, what is left is just a few faded banknotes!</p>
<p>Holding them in your hand, you are quite happy, and you also think: This is the price of sweat and labor.</p>
<h3>Geography Class</h3>
<h3>Tea-Picking Women</h3>
<p>— Ye Cheng</p>
<p>Every spring, many tea merchants go to Jianning to set up shop, buying tea leaves from the Wuyi Mountains and nearby tea-producing areas. By the time spring is old, the tea leaves are all bought up, and they pack up their belongings and return home, often bringing back some minor ailment. Our villagers commonly call them "tea mountain guests."</p>
<p>When they first arrive, the tea leaves are being picked intermittently from the branches. Very few have been picked and dried. They are picked and dried in batches, and then carried to the tea merchants' shops. The tea fields on the mountains are mostly arranged in layers, sloping upwards like ladders, in tiers. The green leaves fill the branches, and the tea-picking women, standing, are picking the tender leaves. They are just a head taller than the tea trees, their black hair and white faces looking as if they grew from the tea branches. When their clothes are about the same color as the tea leaves, it is even harder to distinguish them. Picking tea, singing mountain songs, chatting idly, echoing each other, they look so innocent, and in front of the tea merchants, they are especially amorous.</p>
<p>The tea production is very abundant. They work hard in the mountains to cultivate the tea fields, adding a lot of effort and capital, hoping that when spring comes, the weather will be suitable, and they will have branches full of just-right, not-too-old, not-too-young green leaves. Then the family's food and clothing will depend on these things. How can they not be happy, carefully picking their tea, focusing on their patrons, wanting to sell all the tea and get more money? Therefore, when many experienced tea merchants or tea shop owners and young masters sometimes go to their tea fields to personally inspect the tea bushes, they are especially like butterflies dancing among the flowers, doing their best to show off their charm. This kind of almost excessive lewdness has been passed down for many years and has become a customary practice.</p>
<p>Many tea shops mostly use their own stoves in the shops to dry the tea leaves they buy, hiring many women to pick and dry the tea, and many women carry tea leaves to the shops to sell. They especially love to tease each other. Although the men and women are strangers, the degree of intimacy is unmatched anywhere else in its prevalence and depth, and it is regarded as a very common custom. They play to their heart's content, without any pretense or shame. Therefore, tea shops are generally places for men and women to gather and have fun, and the most intimate aspect of sexual relations is also regarded as normal, not at all strange.</p>
<p>What is even more surprising is that these tea-picking women are from respectable families. Every family in that area produces tea leaves, so almost all the women in every family are like this, having affairs with many tea merchants and the assistants they bring along. This kind of custom seems strange to outsiders, but they themselves act as if nothing is wrong.</p>
<p>The reason why this has become a custom is somewhat related to economic life, but in China, this so-called "land of propriety," it is a bit unusual.</p>
<h3>Night</h3>
<p>— Ye</p>
<p>I deeply love the night, especially the night in the countryside.</p>
<p>When twilight falls on the ridges of the fields, the starry eyes twinkle in the sky, or a bright moon peeps through the treetops, you will hear the long howls of village dogs echoing in the fields, and the mournful cries of oxen returning to their sheds. If it is summer, fireflies twinkle among the croaking of frogs; if it is autumn, autumn insects sing their complex songs under the rustling wind. These things all make you feel an indescribable artistic conception, like a wisp of light, refreshing sorrow, making you linger and ponder deeply.</p>
<p>Or, if you stroll along the riverbank at this time, you can hear the gurgling of the water and the sound of fish gulping. Occasionally, a small boat rows past, the sound of oars breaking the stillness of the surroundings, vibrating outwards, the lingering sound lingering, like an endless song.</p>
<p>The goodness of the night can only be tasted; descriptions in words and writing cannot express even a fraction of it. I remember the French poet Chenier singing of the night like this:</p>
<p>I wish you, beautiful night,</p>
<p>A clear and serene night that allows the earth to rest!</p>
<p>O shadowy silence,</p>
<p>You only hear the sound of my poems,</p>
<p>And the call of the waves lapping against the shore.</p>
<h3>Song of a Wanderer</h3>
<p>— Xu Yongbo</p>
<p>On a clear morning in early winter, braving the lingering cold wind sent from the north, stepping on thin ice in puddles on the muddy road, carrying a very simple baggage, I raised my brave and firm steps and began to embark on a wandering journey.</p>
<p>The wandering journey is long. As I walked, I have silently walked for three years. On the journey, I sang:</p>
<p>What my hometown gave me were only some miserable impressions: disease, death, endless sorrow, high-speed poverty. I cannot stay any longer, I must leave, I must go: I want to go to the ends of the earth, to many unknown and distant places, wandering, wandering, wandering, wandering forever! Growing in wandering!</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>Tempering in wandering!</p>
<p>·····················</p>
<p>Indeed, I have silently walked for three years. Growing? Tempering? Perhaps my body has grown a little taller, my heart has become a little harder, but what makes me sad is not those things. What makes me sad is the lengthening of my beard, the aging of my cheeks, the fact that the years have gone by and will never return!</p>
<p>Yes, wandering is the only way out for a frustrated person, but does this road have an end?</p>
<p>There is an end, but it is still far away. If we have absolute determination, then there will always be a day when we reach the end.</p>
<p>Please look forward to the achievements and creations of us wanderers!</p>

<h3>Basic Qualifications of Actresses in the Mouths of Several Movie Tycoons (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Jia</p>
<p>Whenever a woman sees a female star, whether she is on the stage, on the screen, or on the radio, and hears about her fame that overflows the universe, her amazing income, and her luxurious diet and living, almost no one does not envy her. Female students in American schools, in particular, have a deep envy for movie actresses. They hope that one day, their names will also be made into electric lights, shining at the entrance of the theater. Since film has become one of the arts, then being a film actor is certainly no longer like the old days of performing, so despised by people. Therefore, although our Chinese young women do not have the same film fever as American women, the trend is such that the general female students in the future may be as envious of wanting to be movie stars as American female students. Therefore, now seeing what the several movie tycoons said about the basic qualifications of actresses in the American film magazines, translating and publishing it may not be a superfluous thing.</p>
<p>The movie tycoons mentioned here are eight people who are extremely powerful in the film industry. They have created many talents, so the basic qualifications of actresses they said must be very valuable talks. These eight people received the same question, which is: "When a girl comes to ask you to give her some work to do, what is the first important qualification you seek in your eyes?" The first to be asked was Earl Carroll, a tycoon in the production of song and dance films. He produces several great song and dance films every year. He collects many song and dance talents and beautiful women every year. He said: "The first qualification I pay attention to is beauty. But there are two kinds of beauty, one is facial beauty, and the other is physical beauty. Facial beauty occupies a more important position in the two, because facial beauty is really relatively rare, so it is also more difficult to seek. What I said above is for selecting ordinary song and dance girls. When selecting important roles in the film, we must use a different measure. For example, when we are looking for a comedic role, we don't necessarily require her to be beautiful. As long as she can especially make us laugh, we will be satisfied, because we find it funny, and the audience will definitely find it funny too. Furthermore, when selecting the entire class of song and dance girls, we must also speculate on the audience's preferences, because their psychology always requires them to be perfect. Therefore, in addition to the beauty of each person, we also require the overall harmony, which is group beauty. Of course, the individual beauty that each dancer should have individually has not been neglected." It is of course that a song and dance actor should have beauty. But besides beauty, what other essential conditions are there? Earl Carroll's answer is: "Of course, beauty cannot stand alone and make its owner a female actor. She must also have talent, personality, youth, and general attractiveness."</p>
<p>The second person to be asked was also a tycoon in the song and dance world, George White. After receiving this question, he thought for a while, but he also said that beauty is the first condition. "Then, do you mean facial beauty or physical beauty?" George White said: "Both are equally important." He also said: "Every time I want to select song and dance girls, there are at least dozens of applicants. But I only use five or sixty people. Their salaries are roughly forty dollars a week. Some can earn fifty dollars, some can earn one hundred dollars, or even one hundred and twenty-five dollars, depending on their abilities. The number of years a dancer works is not fixed. When I rehearse new films every year, I usually have to select a new class of actors. All those who are song and dance actors, after they are slightly successful, are often absorbed by the sons of wealthy families, or they do not cherish their bodies, so that after a year or two, they are not worthy of continued employment. We have no rules prohibiting the use of old women, and we have no discrimination against them. But I don't know why, when we select people every year, there are always many times more new people than old people." From the above conversation, we can see that the working age of a song and dance actor is extremely short, and the reason for the short age is probably caused by themselves. The routine second question is: "Besides beauty, what other essential conditions are there?" George White's brief answer is: "Talent." "Then, besides talent, what else?" He said: "Nothing. A woman who has both beauty and talent already has the qualifications for success." (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Talk and Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Peach and Plum Calamity" 丨 Jin Cheng</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Everyone is looking forward to the first work of the Diantong Company with enthusiasm. Yes, this first work of "Peach and Plum Calamity" did not disappoint us, although it has been changed once, it still maintains the original style to some extent.</p>
<p>Of course, when we examine this work, we still have to base it on the officially released version.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that this is the first work in China created with the method of sound film. Although many subtitles are now inserted, it still does not bury the original shape of the work. From screenwriter to director, the author is very careful in using the more advanced techniques of sound film, making the first attempt in China. From this, we can see that Chinese sound film, after "Rouge Market" and "Sister Flowers", this "Peach and Plum Calamity" does have its epoch-making significance.</p>
<p>Here, tightly grasping the widespread unemployment problem of intellectuals as the theme, in this unemployment panic, its deep social response and reality in the author's creative attitude is the most worthy of our comfort. After the students step out of the school gate, where is their way out? This serious social problem will inevitably cause deep consideration in the impression of the audience. Especially for middle school or university students, they will never ignore the author's true reaction to their lives, right? Just on this point, it determines the significance of the existence of "Peach and Plum Calamity."</p>
<p>When I personally saw the male protagonist being executed by shooting during the test screening, the heavy footsteps and the sound of iron chains, the sound of the execution at the time of execution hit the heart of the old principal, causing him to be shocked, and then hearing the final song, and the same as understood by every audience, the youth of intellectuals in today's society has no guarantee of life.</p>
<p>If someone misunderstands and says that the male protagonist is too impatient, it is obviously an insult to the author. Society and school are completely different. All the despicable and sinister manifestations in society will inevitably arouse the sense of justice of young people. The author loudly said in the mouth of the male protagonist: "When you can't bear it anymore, you can't bear it." On the contrary, the female protagonist is able to endure. She is ridiculed as a "vase". She has suffered the insults of the manager or colleagues, but she finally slapped the manager and ran out of the hotel. So this is by no means to be explained by whether someone is good at dealing with people or good at treating people, the author very clearly tells us in the scene of recruiting an employee and a large group of applicants coming, this is the whole social problem.</p>
<p>Let's say it again, the author deals with the personality of the male and female protagonists, he wants the youth to live on no matter what, even if they are demoted from company employees to workers, they must have the courage to live on. This also shows the author's courage to face reality. Here, he fully depicts the difficulties in the lives and the hard work of the male and female protagonists. On the day his child was born, the factory did not give him a day off. A few days after giving birth, the female protagonist had to work desperately, and the result was falling down the stairs. This kind of cruel depiction method is very powerful in grasping the audience's emotions on the screen. As for the final climax, its tension and strength go without saying.</p>
<p>However, after all, there are some shortcomings in this, which is not to say that the sound in some places is not clear enough, as a major defect, but in describing pleasant and joyful scenes, the slow tone is detrimental. In addition, the current subtitles make the work lose its unified style and even distort the theme.</p>
<p>Some people are very worried, thinking that this is a stage play from director to actors, the so-called stage play of film methods, and even more dangerous is that they are afraid that it will become a stereotype like civilized drama in the future. Regarding this point, I do not want to strictly separate drama and film. At least actors who have received strict basic training on the stage are still extremely advantageous on the screen. However, due to the difference in time and space, it is easier to be as real as possible on film. Therefore, we can never say that it is dangerous from the stage to the screen, but if we require actors to not overdo it at all, it depends on the director's strict control.</p>
<p>I am quite satisfied to see this first "Peach and Plum Calamity" made with the techniques of sound film, and I dare to introduce it to the audience.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Bad Boy" 丨 Cathay</h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>Pecks Bad Boy</p>
<p>From the perspective of its performed effect, this is a film that earns quite a few tears from children who understand English. Therefore, it is necessary for us to give it considerable attention.</p>
<p>The story is simple. It writes about a child who is intelligent and gifted, wins the first prize in the Father-Son Association's essay competition, is good at "reading faces and distinguishing colors," and is righteous in his behavior, loved by his peers, and a club leader. However, because he is an adopted child from an orphanage, he is bullied by his aunt and cousins, which evolves into small disputes between family members and father and son, progressing from a small tragedy to a "father-son reunion."</p>
<p>In today's society, where family and father-son relationships are purely constructed and maintained on economic relations, the tragedy of a so-called adopted child who ends up in an orphanage and is then brought into a wealthy family, suffering various oppressions from relatives and society for the sake of property inheritance, for the sake of society, and even for personal survival, has been written into many famous novels and plays. However, this tragic story continues to exist and occur, which must be attributed to the defects of the entire system. Only an author with a sound worldview can accurately grasp its essence, analyze it, and point out its pathology.</p>
<p>The original author of "The Bad Boy," George Peck, not only failed to achieve this but merely delivered a pointless sermon. For example, he implies that the adoptive father should not listen to others' instigations, and the adopted son should not have a violent personality. According to him, it seems that if Peck (the adoptive father) hadn't brought his sister-in-law and nephew to live at home, or if Bill (the adopted son) could have silently endured the humiliation, the tragedy would not have happened. Isn't this deceptive preaching? Therefore, this only deceives innocent children to shed tears.</p>
<p>The credit for extracting these tears must be given to the director, Edward Cline. He handled this simple story very well. In terms of structure, development, and clues, whether the secrets are hidden or revealed, everything is rigorous, smooth, clear, and lively and natural. The writing of Bill's talent and behavior is naturally brought out through fishing, winning awards, treating friends, and doing arithmetic. The aunt's habits and the humiliation he will suffer later are depicted by the lipstick mark left by the aunt when she kisses him. The conflict between the two sides is revealed by the angry stares of the two dogs facing each other. The relationship between Bill and the dog is used several times to increase the emotional component, and the attitudes of the male and female servants towards the aunt are used several times to contrast the parents' oversight. Other aspects, such as the grasp of the atmosphere and the contrast of tones, all increase the dramatic and emotional power. As for the many scenes after the climax is formed when half of the secret is revealed, the performance of the child star Jackie Cooper is indeed profound and full. The places where tears are extracted are simply unbelievable that such a small child can act so well. It is certainly the author's intention to forcibly inject his subjective opinions into the child, making him act like an adult to preach on his behalf, but due to the untruthful feelings and facts, his intention will be denied, which is probably something the author did not expect. Naturally, we cannot attribute this to the director; it seems that the screenwriter should be responsible.</p>
<p>The actor who plays the father has the perfection of a burning stove, and he and the child star Jackie Cooper are successfully matched.</p>

<h3>Golden Lotus Calamity (Have a Heart) (2)</h3>
<p>— Shu Min</p>
<p>Since the accident that night, Sally had been staying in the hospital for over two months. At this time, Sally's heart was pounding, quietly awaiting the doctor's judgment. Many times, she always comforted herself, telling herself that she would definitely be able to walk as usual, and that Heaven would not deprive her of the joy of freedom. But Doctor Spears slowly took out a thick-soled shoe from the box and handed it to her. Sally took the shoe and stared blankly. Her heart stopped pounding, and the blood throughout her body seemed to freeze. It turned out that the sole of the shoe was more than two inches thick. Only then did she realize the extent of the injury to her foot. Although she felt uncomfortable, she pretended and smiled at the white satin shoe she was still wearing on her foot, saying, "This is so ugly, much worse than the one on my foot." Doctor Spears reached out his hand, shook hers, comforted her, and told her that this was the most they could do. There were also one or two orthopedic experts who might have greater abilities than them. But they were all in Europe, and one of them, Doctor Perunzi, was especially famous, and he resided in Vienna. After Doctor Spears finished speaking, he slowly took off the white satin shoe from her foot and replaced it with the thick-soled shoe. He also carefully tied her shoelaces and then covered her feet with a velvet blanket. Just at that moment, Joey walked in. Doctor Spears stood up and said a few words to him, praising Sally's courage. After he finished speaking, he left.</p>
<p>After Doctor Spears left, Joey suddenly turned around and said to Sally, "Can you walk as usual?" Sally did not answer him, but slowly pulled off the blanket, revealing the terribly ugly foot wearing the thick-soled shoe. Joey was startled when he saw it. He exclaimed, "What? Do you have to wear that kind of thing to walk?" His fear and disgust were very obvious. When Joan saw Joey's expression, she mocked him angrily, "Her foot is shorter, what about your foot? Are you going to shrink your foot too?" When Joey heard this, he also said angrily to Joan, "What's wrong? I didn't mention anything. I didn't say anything about getting married or not. What else is there to say? I am willing to do things to the end." Although Joey said this, Sally had already seen his true intentions. She saw the frightened look on his face, and his repeated denials, saying that he was willing to marry her. She had already understood that their love was hopeless. She wanted to break off the engagement with him, but Joey continued to pretend to argue. Sally couldn't stand it anymore, so she told Joey to leave. Joey was happy to leave after receiving an order to leave.</p>
<p>After Joey left, Sally looked at Joan, and she forced a smile. She said that from now on, she would be a "foreign girl." She could do some "foreign girl" things in the future. In any case, she must continue to maintain her life. She said, "Being a 'foreign girl' is very interesting. We will still be very happy in the future, living together." When she said this, she secretly rejoiced that her voice did not tremble. But Joan couldn't help it, and her tears fell down. She quickly turned her head away, not letting Sally see. Then she went out to pack Sally's things, so that she could go home from the hospital with her. Only Sally was left in the room. She looked at her clumsy foot and then at the small, exquisite silk shoe on the table. She forced herself down and wanted to try to walk a few steps. Sadly, she knew that her foot was already lame. Her tears could not help but gush out of her eyes like a spring. She fell into the rattan sofa, covered her face with both hands, and cried very sadly. (To be continued)</p>
