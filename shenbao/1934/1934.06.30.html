<h3>崇尙節約</h3>
<p>— 謹</p>
<p>國民黨三中全會通過了厲行節約運動案。决定由政府和民衆雙方着手。可惜實施困難。成效極微。但我們擁擠節約運動。决不因此而灰心。我們依然主張把那些日常生活所不必需的物資節省起來。用作禦侮救國的後援。這是世界主要各國當局。和其國民共同努力的事情。論到我國國難的嚴重。財政的竭蹶。民生的窮困。在世界上恐怕再找不出第二個。照理我們該得格外努力於節約。以期積儲了人力和物力。用以復興國家。挽回民族當前的厄運。這是天經地義。分屬國民。决無推諉的餘地。不過我們知道中國人是世界最勤儉的民族。特別是從事於耕種的農民。終歲辛苦。出最大的勞力。換最低的享樂。他們目的。祗在略求溫飽。所以老早就節約到無可再節了。我們今日贊成節約並提倡節約。無疑的是對着在大都會和各中小城巿中人說的。</p>
<p>我國現在的窮困。在人事上。農村本身是不負責任的。因爲他們早對政府和一般社會盡其應盡的本分了。可是城巿和都會就不然了。其間有許多人。非但脫離了生產者的集團。化爲純粹的消費分子。並且還往往殘害小民。阻碍生產的進步。現在城巿消耗物力。摧殘人力的地方。比之農村高出十倍百倍。事實昭著。有目共鑒。不過農村旣已疲敝不堪。其所影響於都巿。亦必非常嚴重。換句話說。都巿經濟亦不免由恐慌而次第趨於破產。假如再沒有切實挽救的辦法。恐怕會使整個的國民經濟。陷於破毀狀態。節約運動雖祗是挽救危局的方法之一。如能推行得宜。亦可以有相當的補助。</p>
<p>現在要問節約運動。應從那方開始推行呢。我們認爲必須先從政治上社會上負責人員的本身作起。他們要使政治廉潔化。同時以身作則。樹立起廉潔政府的楷模來。在中央負責的。固該示範於全國。節各省地方當局。以至於接近人民的縣長。亦應在其各個範圍內。身體力行。他們要眞能爲國家爲人民作事。其本人享樂。必不超過生活必需的限度。這兩點辦到後。纔能進一步把他們所表示的風度。去感化社會中的上層分子。設使社會中的上層分子。受其感化。相率造成一種良好的風氣。結果也足影響政治。使政治上的污點漸次滌除。總之。節約運動該由上層作起。因爲無論中國外國。女的男的。浪費最多奢侈最甚的人。總是接近上層社會的。所以政治領袖和社會領袖。果能實行節約。則跟着跑的人必會多起來。事實上自然比較容易見效。</p>
<p>說到這裏。我們便連帶想起現在的靑年學生。因爲他們做將來領袖的可能性。比較常人大些。所以他們的行爲。與國家社會前途的關係。亦比較密切。現在內地在學靑年能够節儉勤奮。知道發揮農業國民族性特長的。固然是很多。但在都會城巿中的學生。特別是高中以上的學生。忘去本身責任。寖染奢侈習尙。也眞不在少數。這是負政治·敎育·及社會改革責任的領袖們所應特別注意的。總之。節約運動。不一定要求其普遍於社會各階層。而要求其獲得最大的實效。那末上層社會和在學靑年。所應盡的使命獨大。其理由或則因爲他們的生活比較寬裕。而容易流爲奢侈。或則因爲他們的身分容易使普通人跟着摹倣。一出一入之間。關係絕鉅。今後節約運動。會不會蹈旣往的覆轍。當視這兩批人能不能自己的覺悟以爲斷。</p>

<h3>彈劾案原文</h3>
<p>又監委劉侯武、呈于院長文云、呈爲提案彈劾事、查國家借用外欵手續、本極詳明、政府興築鐵路規劃、尤宜審愼、鐵道部爲掌管全國道行政最高機關、對於利用外資、應如何尊重國權、不爲苛酷條件所束縛、並應遵守國法、提請中政會議核准、交立法院審核、乃可舉行、對於興築路綫應以最經濟政策開發國家與人民未來之利益、蠲除一切浮冒中飽之舊污、職責所在、無待煩言、乃現任鐵道部長顧孟餘、辦理大潼鐵路材料借欵一案、竟有大謬不然者、覈其喪權違法害國營私之處、厥有四端、臚陳如左、</p>
<p>㈠查正及鐵路原借法欵四千萬佛郞、期限三十年、按期付還本息、已於民國二十</p>
<p>一年三月一日已如數淸償、理應根據合同、解除契約收回自辦、乃顧孟餘延不接收、竟秘密與法代表瑪爾丹繼續時行材料借欵、（卽由法方代購材料作爲現欵結賬、分期償還、每半年爲一期、十期攤還）迨瑪爾丹回法、與巴黎電機廠商訂材料借欵總額九千萬佛郞、作爲展修大潼路之用、分爲三批過付、計五千萬佛郞爲一期、二千五百萬佛郞爲一期、一千五百萬佛郞爲一批、每批各立合同一份、遂於民國二十二年七月一日、由顧孟餘派代表與巴黎電機廠代表、簽定成立、致使正太鐵路遲至一年之久、始爲形式上之收回、又恐外人指摘、乃將材料借欵合同、僞稱爲購料合同、（聞該項材料已到數批、由隴海路潼西段及大潼路分用、）查此項材料借欵、除以甫經接收之正太鐵路收入作抵外、又以中國交通等華銀行團爲擔保、此外並續任法人維諾爲正太路車務處長、改任法人薄言爲正太路總稽核、兼大潼路總工程司、而中交等銀行團、因債務關係、亦派石家莊交通銀行行長汪貽曾、爲駐路監察員、是正太路名爲接收、大權仍操諸法人之乎、而所有全部收入、作爲無限制擔保、條件尤爲苛酷、此該部長對於借用外欵不顧利害喪失國權之所爲、應付懲戒者一、</p>
<p>㈡此項材料借欵數達九千萬佛郞、旣以展修大潼路爲名、又復明知不經濟之工事用欵、與夫損害國權之苛酷條件、斷不能取得中政會議及立法機關之同意、於是表面上稱之爲購料借欵、分批訂約、攤少額數、希冀蒙混國人耳目、以圖避免呈請中政會議核准交立法院依法審核之法定手續、此該部長違反國法、對於中政會議及立法機關職權之行使巧爲趨避之所爲、應付懲戒者二、</p>
<p>㈢所謂大潼綫者、興工至今、將屆一年、僅自榆次起循同成舊綫至太谷間三十五公里、原有土工重行修復、鋪軌亦只有五六里之短、（軌間爲四英尺八寸半比較正太路軌間一公尺寬狹不同）而山西兵工、興築之同蒲路、亦自太原起、經倫次太谷至介休止、是太原至榆次間之正太路與榆次至太谷間之大潼路、遙遙相望、均成爲最近距離之平行綫、際此國營鐵路亟待擴充之秋、關於國內重要交通、急宜興築者何止此路、該部長借用鉅額外資、乃獨爲此平行路綫之修築、先其所緩重其所輕、岡識大體、措置乖方、且目前工事期間、旣以愒玩時日糜耗薪給、他日該路綫縱幸而修築完成、又將以兩平行綫路之故、啟營業上之競爭、結果必致兩歸失敗、此該部長措施失當、故意損害國家利益之所爲、應付懲戒者三、</p>
<p>㈣查刑法凟職罪第一百三十六條載、公務員對於主管或監督之事務、直接或間接圖利者、處三年以下有期徒刑、得並科三千元以下罰金等語、今該部長對於此項鉅額材料借欵、始則秘密進行、未經法定手續、斷則巧立名目、僞稱購料合同、終且對於政府機關購置物品公開標投之普通手續、而亦抹煞不顧、試問九千萬佛郞之購料、爲數不貲、四萬萬人之耳目、寗能盡掩、諭者謂此項購料黑幕多端、其漁利之精巧、中飽之數目、有甚於前此北京政府時代之借欵回扣者、人言嘖嘖、不爲無因、處此世界不景氣之秋、各國出產物品供過於求、類皆貶價競賣、已成普通現象、則是法方代購材料、其品質之優劣、價格之高低、所値是否眞確、全無標準、事前旣係秘密訂約、諱莫如深、事後又不正式公開招標投筒、謂非圖利、其誰之信、此該部長凟職營私之所爲、應付懲戒者四、</p>
<p>綜觀以上、所列各端、該鐵道部長顧孟餘之喪失國權、違反國法損害國益凟職營私情節顯然、亟應嚴加懲處、茲謹依法提案彈劾、敬請移付懲戒以重國法而儆官邪、實爲公便、謹呈院長于、（計附圖一紙）監察委員劉侯武、（二十九日專電）</p>

<h3>羅斯福總統　宣言與民更始　實行三大事以利萬民　否認共產或法西斯化　復興成績未損憲法權利</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　羅斯福總統今晚以無綫電播音向全國演說、謂政府之最大目的、在恢復基本公道與正義、並竭力否認有共產或法西斯之傾向、總統復叙述其政績稱、政府將來最重要之目的有三、㈠美國各個人民之經濟保險、㈡發展美國之水陸富源、㈢社會保險、總統並未詳述政府將以何種方法達到此項目的、惟言將來當能向全國人民作詳細之解釋、羅氏對於國會之成就、深爲讚美、而認消除黨派成見、爲最大之成功、因以其能以不偏不黨之精神、討論一切也、總統於是略述上屆國會之經過、並特別致意於文生氏最優勢海軍案及新定幣制法、羅氏之言曰、「國會最重要之成功在建立適合現代生活之政策、使美國之幣制更加公道、並使金銀二種金屬、皆成爲美國幣制之本位云、總統繼以其政策與十年來前任各總統相較、以爲若輩皆目光太近、故彼於一九三三年三月就任伊始、卽實行下列三項計畫、㈠救濟失業與貧困、㈡經濟復興、㈢改善經濟衰落所引起之不良狀態、恢復基本之公理與正義、自該項計畫實行之後、失業之數大减農村收入激增、一切商業亦皆漸入常軌、至批評者所謂彼之政策不合美國傳統正軌、羅氏加以反詰、謂試問究有何人曾失去其憲法範圍以內之權利與自由、一般自以爲曾受新政之害者、總統以爲皆屬要求在政治上及財政上享受特殊權利之人、彼等皆因不能以取巧之方法損人利已、故而出此怨聲耳、總統謂現在人民之統治力量、已使對於國家之信心漸次恢復、故不必再事過慮、以爲新政有共產及法西斯主義之嫌、最後羅氏略述其出巡檀香山計畫、詎將與海地·哥倫比亞·及巴拿馬諸國總</p>
<p>統會晤云、（二十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　羅總統今日對全國民衆廣播去年十月後第一次之演詞、綜述當局復興運動之成績、其言曰、今有四事、請民衆答覆者、（一）汝當目前生活較去年爲佳乎、（二）汝等債務担負較前爲輕乎、（三）汝等銀行存欵較前安穩乎、（四）汝等工作狀况較前改良乎、汝等答語如何、殆無疑問、政府現所採保障國家生活之三個步驟、爲救濟復興與善後、此種步驟、實屬必要、其故有三、一爲過去十年中國人狂妄追求不勞而獲的財帛所造成之萎靡、二爲今日許多困難皆事業界與金融界領袖昧于公道與正義的基本原則所釀成、三爲經濟生活中現有之新狀况、羅總統繼言及工資之增加、失業之减少農產價値之增高、與萬千室家之得免于流離失所、指此爲其政策成功之明證、並謂政府獲此成績、而未損害憲法上自由之權利也、雖有若干人感受不便、但在比較上僅居少數、政府此後在民生安全程序中將致力于較好家庭之設置、水陸利源之運用、與社會保險之設法云、羅總統復言及實業自治、謂吾人所建之目的、一面在保護實業、不使其互相傾軋、一面在保護消費人維持適當之競爭、以免零售物價之狂漲、少數懦夫以進步爲慮者、對于吾人所行之事、常欲䨓以怪異名詞、如法西斯主義、共產主義或社會主</p>

<h3>論中國與銀價</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　孟却斯德指導今日載有著名經濟學家沙爾特爵士一文、略謂渠意中國之勢力、未經有力的運用、殊屬可憾、中國所需者爲銀價之穩固、而非人爲的提高、中國之利害、應使中國在白銀政策中有支配之勢力、一九三零年與一九三一年之世界經濟厄運、中國獨能避免、其故因銀價低落也、自日美兩國放棄金本位後、銀價高起、情勢轉變、中國輸出、乃大减少、致處於入超之嚴重逆境、而有資金輸出之必要、中國因內地不靖、現銀乃集中上海、致困苦愈甚、而內地通貨缺少、物價因以愈低、中國必須恢復其內地原有狀况、庶外資復能源源流入中國云、（二十八日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）　今日路透訪員走訪絲業聯合會人員、叩以英法新商約之影響、據答、彼等尙未充分研究該項文件、但彼等之意見以爲將使中國絲綢受重大影響、染色及印花綢因低稅率所得之任何利益、將因未印花與未染色綢貨稅率加重、而全被剝削、英國由華輸入之印花與染色綢貨、爲數殊微云、絲業聯合會對於政府遲遲不解决此問題、頗爲不耐、將於下星期舉行重要會議、目前英日間對此項問題顯未舉行任何談判、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>英法商約內容</h3>

<h3>讀書問答　梅蘭芳與中國舊劇的前途　丨答李如晦君丨　讀書指導：</h3>
<p>在十七日大晚報火炬上，讀過侍桁君的「梅蘭芳赴俄演劇問題」後，不禁發生了如下的疑問：</p>
<p>一、中國舊劇的藝術價値：在該文內，侍桁君首先援引了季子君反對舊劇的三大理由（原文未讀過）一、京戲中的大鑼大鼓是非音樂的；二、男扮女裝是屬於原始劇的藝術的而且俗惡不堪；三、男唱女的聲音，或女唱男的聲音是非自然的而且有些滑稽·接着，他更進一步完全否認舊劇的藝術價値，認爲「舊劇是野蠻社會的一種藝術，無論如何也不能適合現代社會」的東西、於是一則曰，「試問那一個理解藝術的人，能够忍得過那鑼鼓喧天的騷擾，那怪聲怪調的笑和哭？」再則曰，「又有那一個欣賞藝術的人，看得那紅鬍子的花臉，那任何時代都不能有的奇怪服裝？」中國舊劇，眞的如侍桁君所說那樣毫無藝術價値嗎？我不改太相信！不說別的，單說它的悠久的歷史，廣泛的流傳，也不容我們無批判地加以否認。一件事物的存在，必然有其社會的根據及其自身能够存在的價値，我不是「國粹派」有意替舊劇張目，但我覺得侍桁君的抹殺一切，是並不能使人信服的，只暴露了自己對於戲劇之無理解。譬如，反對古文，就不能否認一切古文的藝術性，離騷，詩經李杜等之詩，能說沒有藝術性嗎？而且侍桁君的所謂「藝術性」，是拿些什麼做標凖呢？這是要求你們解答者一。</p>
<p>二、蘇聯爲什麼要請梅蘭芳呢？關於蘇聯要請梅蘭芳演劇的理由，從該文內，可以看出兩點，一是侍桁君所引報告這新聞的記者的話，說是「全世界都已公認中國劇是了富於象徵主義，而蘇俄的藝術界也正在流行象徵主義，所以要鑑賞梅博士的藝術一，另一說是侍桁君自己說的「蘇俄旣有那筆請梅氏獻藝的閒錢」而「爲了新奇」的緣故。對於這兩說，我均不敢置信：中國劇之是否爲象徵主義，侍桁君也略有解說了，但蘇聯呢，據我所聞，正流行着社會主義現實主義，寫實主義不僅沒有沒落，而且更提高到新的階段。爲什麼又在流行什麼象徵主義呢？這一點侍桁君未能特別提出來說明我認爲是很可惜的。至於侍桁君所云，更是近於開玩笑。蘇聯即使有閒錢，蘇聯對於文化建設雖然不遺餘力，也决不會盲目地好奇地來請梅蘭芳去「觀光」？然而，蘇聯之請梅蘭芳演劇究竟爲了什麼？這是要請你們解答者二。</p>
<p>三、中國戲劇的前途：中國的話劇運動，雖然有了相當的開展，但平心而論，在大衆的心目中，舊劇仍佔有極大的地位，不僅在農村內，完全是舊劇的勢力，即在大城巿，合話劇與電影，才是與舊劇相對抗。當然，就整體說，舊劇是應該堅决反對的，舊劇的沒落，是必然的。但是，戲劇是最大衆化的藝術，我們要創造更大衆化的戲劇，我們便不能不注意舊劇之所以能吸引廣大觀衆的主觀和客觀的條件。試問，在激烈反對舊劇，建設新劇的時候，在决定戲劇運動的前途的當兒，這是不是應該特別提出來的一個問題呢？這要請你們解答者三。</p>
<p>以上三點，不僅是我個人的疑問，我想，也一定是許多愛好戲劇者的疑問，希望你們趕快給我們一個正確的回答。本如晦丨－</p>

<h3>二十年後的短波預測</h3>
<p>— 王輔民</p>
<p>想到二十年前，短波剛剛實用時，一般業餘家，皆在二百公尺以下活動，當然，在那個時候，還沒有無綫電話，卽使有了也是在長波上。</p>
<p>那麽二十年後，短波無綫電將有什麽新的發展呢？你只要看這幾年來的進步，已足够驚奇了。那麼二十年後，奇怪的發明，在下文所講的，一定能够實現。</p>
<p>最先說的是電視，（Television）每一個無綫電專家皆承認，電視是脫離不了短波的，換句話說，電視是要靠短波來發展，將來或許要在超短波（Utra-short-wave）上發展也說不定。￣</p>
<p>現在最大的短波電臺，也不過發出四百基羅瓦特，比較上好像小一點，無疑的，到了將來，電臺一定要增加到一千基羅特瓦以上，並且一定也有這種電臺去使用這大電力。現在我們論到短波唯一的缺點，就是衰落，（fading）將來一定能設法除去。一隻dx電臺，譬如說在１０，０００英里外，用了二管收音機，可以像收本地電臺一樣響亮，到了那個時候，不要怎樣野心去做十燈或十五燈的收音機，一隻一燈，二燈，最多三燈，已足够你放揚聲器了。</p>
<p>將來播送商業與政治上的事務時，同一節目可播送三種或者四種語言，並且是在同一波長。此預測，讀者一定以爲很奇怪，但是；幾年前，ColumbiaBradcasting　System　不是已經拿廣播及電視在同波長上發送出去嗎？將來，假使一個遠地方的人，他可在他的收音機上轉動選擇開關（selected　switch），聽他所要聽得懂的語言，譬如一個英國電臺，播送英文，德文，與西班牙文，在同一時候，用四個報告員，播送同一節目，這意思就是說：將來短波是國際的。</p>
<p>將來歐洲與美洲的郵件，將用一特製的飛機在高氣層中（Stratosfher）郵寄，祇須四個至六個鐘頭便到，機上不乘載旅客，祇裝小包的郵件。該項飛機的駕駛、着陸，出發，等等將都用短波控制，那就是所謂無綫電遙遠控制機械是了。（Radio　telemechanics）</p>
<p>再講下去，就是無綫電印刷報紙了。（Radio　frints　newsfa'er）據美國無綫電合組公司(Radio　Corforation　of　America)聲稱，彼已發明用超短波(Utra-high-frequency)直接傳遞電報的方法，(Facsimile　telegram　deliyery　systcm)就是除去一點一劃的笨方法，而直接來傳送文字，所以此後（也可說現在），我們可以拿親手寫的文件，簽字等，在印眞機械(Facsimile)中，送到遠方去。</p>
<p>無綫電報紙，(Radil　newsfafer也就同上所說的印眞機原埋差不多，完全自動，不藉一點人力。機內包括一隻短波收音機，用鐘來管理此機的動作，譬如說：早上二點鐘，收天特別印眞機信號後，就有一卷報紙，在棒上轉動，同時有一部特別機械裝置，（內包含壓縮空氣瓶，墨水瓶各一，此二瓶全被一調幅的電磁石Modulated　electromagent來管理，在約上噴出如務的墨水。印刷採用雙重制。(duplex)所以報紙的二面，同時可以印好。當信號收入時，紙張就慢慢地轉動，一座機器，像現在的打字機，前後來回的動，一分鐘大槪有數次，於是文字，照片等等，已印好在紙上了，半小時後，報紙完全印好，就自動的被無綫電收音機摺疊起來，放在架上，明天早晨就可有報紙看來，當然，那時所印好的報紙，不會像現在的這麼大，這麽多，祗不過四五頁的地方新聞，重要的宣言，有價値的照像罷了，價値一定很便宜，不會超過現在報紙所售的價格。</p>
<h3>代週率變壓器斷綫速騐法</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>如果收音機發生弊病丨丨雜聲或聲息全無，第一步要檢查的是，當然是測量眞空管各極的電壓、是否合於規定的數値。第二要測驗的，便是低週率變壓器（或喇叭）的綫圈，有無損壞。據經騐和事實告訴我們，損壞的收音機，病源發生在低週率變壓器上面的，差不多要佔十分之八九。</p>
<p>通常測驗低週率變壓器，大槪是先將牠拆下。然後拿聽筒或電壓表串聯電池測量之。此種方法不特手續麻煩，並且時間上也很不經濟。</p>
<p>[丨&gt;輸出輸入&lt;丨]</p>
<p>圖中所示者，爲低週率變壓器在收音機內最普通的接綫方法。變壓器有無繼綫，如依下述步驟試驗，便可節省許多的時間。</p>
<p>㈠先將電壓表的正極，接在眞空管管座的屏極（Ｐ）上，負極接在柵極（Ｇ）上。（如圖所示）此時電壓表如無紀錄，卽證明兩綫圈（Ｔ１之次級綫圈與Ｔ２之初級綫圈）中，至少必有一綫圈已損壞。</p>
<p>㈡次將電壓表之負極，（正極仍接Ｐ處）改接眞空管管座的燈絲負極。（Ｆ－）此時電壓表（與Ｔ２之初級綫圈及Ｂ電池串聯）如無紀錄，卽證明Ｔ２之初級綫圈已損。</p>
<p>㈢最後，將電壓表之正極，（負極仍接Ｇ處）改接眞空管管座的燈絲正極（Ｆ＋）。此時電壓表（與Ｔ１之次級綫圈及Ｃ電池串聯）如無紀錄，卽證明Ｔ１之次級綫圈已損。</p>
<p>Ｔ１之初級綫圈，Ｔ２之次級綫圈及喇叭綫圈，均可依上述方法試驗之。</p>
<p>試驗時如：</p>
<p>㈠電壓表雖有紀錄，但指針跳動不已，此係綫圈將斷未斷之象徵，此時喇叭中，卽有雜聲。</p>
<p>㈡電壓表雖有紀錄，但其數値並不較低於原來的Ｂ電壓或Ｃ電壓，此係綫圈內部發生短路之故，此時喇叭中卽毫無聲響。</p>
<h3>无綫電可以醫病</h3>
<p>— 周麟寶</p>
<p>馬可尼是無綫電的發明者，知道他名字的人大槪不在少數吧，據最近西報羅馬傳來的消息，我們這位和愛迪生一樣電氣界裏的怪傑，竟又有將無綫電紹介到醫藥界裏來的企圖了；他發明了利用高度短波無綫電來戕殺病人體內微菌的原理。它把病人的體溫增高，高到那些微菌萬難生存，一個個都消滅下來。雖然這方法現在還沒有把它來施用到病人的身上試驗過，但是假使我們想一想神秘的無綫電怎麼會發明的，那麼我們可以深信馬可尼這一次又是十有九份可以成功的。</p>
<p>另外又有一種新發明是外科醫生用的電氣解剖刀，它的特點是可以使得受到手術的人，用不到流血，我們驟聽見這消息恐怕有些疑惑吧，但是這是事實，它利用一只發電機所傳來的力，在剖割的時候，使得被割的血管立刻黏塞住了，再也沒有血液流出來了。</p>
<p>我要爲全球的人民向這位發明家祝福，但是唯一的希望是它們問世的時候，千萬莫和Ｘ光一樣，貴得使貧病交迫的人再也無法享受！</p>
<h3>單管雙效强力收音機</h3>
<p>— 劉同康</p>
<p>最近，單管放揚聲器的收音機，在無綫電界很是活躍，無論是業餘或是學餘的研究同志們，幾乎每人都希望能裝置一具，考其原因，其最大的優點就是因爲牠經濟簡單而效力佳，現在我所要介紹的收音機也就是正合上述的原則。</p>
<p>此機的綫路，是從某西文雜誌上抄摘下來的，因爲物質上的缺乏，所以未以能一一按照原綫路裝配，祇能偷工减料的完成是機，不過據試騐的結果，成績甚佳，和用五七號眞空管作檢波，五六號眞空管作低放的二管機效力相彷。</p>
<p>當起初試騐時，眞空管用的是五七號，後來換了八九號强力輸出管，效力大增，音量較前加響不少，音質也極淸晰和婉。</p>
<p>此機作者現正在使用中，Ｂ電用代Ｂ電，輸出電壓的一百八十伏脫，Ａ電用電鈴雙壓器改造，電壓爲六，三伏脫，每於晚間，用揚聲器放音，收本埠各大電臺均極淸響，雖比不上普通的三管機的音量，但一室之中暢聞有餘了，此機選擇甚靈敏，在精密的調整之下，相差僅二十千周率的東方和中西兩電臺竟能完全不相干擾，此外收程亦好，中央，日本，臺北均可收得。</p>
<p>總之，此機效力委實不差，况且綫路簡單，用件也極省，一般好動的同志們不妨一試。</p>
<p>綫路見圖：機中眞空管Ｖ，作者所用的是八九號，其他如五七號七七號等均可配上使用，不過效力較遜罷了！</p>
<p>機中之Ｃ１爲調節波長用之０００３５ＭＦＤ變量電容器，Ｃ２爲０００２５ＭＦＤ之柵極電容器，Ｃ３Ｃ４均爲１ＭＦＤ之傍路電容器，Ｒ１爲４ＭＥＧ柵漏，Ｒ２爲１０００，固定電阻，作代Ｃ電用，Ｒ３爲１０００００，電位器，調節再生用。Ｔ爲５：１低週波變壓器，如用３：５：１者亦可，可在初級ＰＢ間接一００２ＭＦＤ之固定電容器，ＲＦＣ爲高週率阻流圈以穩定振盪用，買現成或自製均可，自製可用一時直徑管，用三八號漆包綫繞一二百圈卽可。</p>
<p>機中綫圈Ｌ１Ｌ２Ｌ３，可用普通三四路綫圈，再生圈不必旋動卽可，或用蛛網版三塊，一繞１０圈作Ｌ１，一繞７２圈作Ｌ２，一繞３５圈作Ｌ３均用二六號漆包，繞畢後將三蛛網合併於一處，固定釘於機內，至於再生圈之正反須由試後决定之。</p>
<p>小經騐</p>
<h3>（一）破舊之電木器皿及唱片之利用</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>破碎之電木器皿，及用舊或碎裂之留聲機唱片，即毫無用處，形同廢物。可利用爲極佳之絕緣物。其用途當然遂碎片之大小及形狀而定；但在可能範圍內，亦可以人工改造之，以適合需要。如大塊之碎電不及唱片欲裁爲合式之小塊，但須先以酒精燈之火熖烘之使軟，然後以剪刀遂所需之大小及形式剪開之。剪時亦甚容易，無異裁剪馬糞紙。如原來灣曲之碎電木片，欲展平爲平板時；但須以火烘軟之，再以木板輕輕壓之，即成平直之電木板矣。工作時應注意者，惟火烘時不宜過急，以免灼焦。</p>
<h3>（二）膠木管之自製法</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>膠木管爲舶來品，價格甚昂。亦可自製之，以供應用。製成之品雖不及購來者之整齊美觀，但其功用則一，且又不費分文，製時亦並無困難也。法取剪成長方形之破舊唱片，用火烘之使軟，再在圓棍上捲之使成圓形，俟冷變硬即成。此法有一缺點，即二端接合處有一裂縫也；但此裂縫於使用時，亦並無妨害。</p>
<h3>（三）避雷器</h3>
<p>— 吳善長</p>
<p>收音機在夏天，總要受到種種的威脅，最利害的，天空高壓的雷電，因此有收音機的總得裝一只避雷器，普通電料行出售的，其價總在一元之譜，至少也得六七角，而且以閘刀式爲多，忘去閘就出危險，很麻煩。</p>
<p>吾人茍能稍稍注意，則避雷器材料隨處都有，製作也很簡便，用壞鋸齒兩片，使其尖端相對，愈近愈好，但不可接觸，一片接天綫，再接收音機天綫柱，一片接地綫，再接地綫柱，則當雷雨時，高壓天空靜電，田鋸齒尖端躍入地綫，收音機不致受損。</p>
<p>同樣的，小圓電池中炭精棒磨尖相對，用剩的鉛筆頭削尖相對，都能應用，不過鉛筆傳電較遜。</p>
<h3>（四）地綫夾的代用品</h3>
<p>— 吳善長</p>
<p>住在上海的，有收音機者的地綫，總連在自來水管上以其簡便而效力亦佳。</p>
<p>這裏所說之地綫夾的代用品是以講義夾做的，我們把皮綫連在講義夾的柄上，再把夾子挾在自來水開關上就行了。（挾管子挾不住的，因爲管子太粗）</p>
<p>這樣一只地綫夾，價値很賤的。</p>
<p>[Ｐ&gt;（五）最經濟的電鍵&lt;Ｐ]</p>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>巿上出售的電鍵，（Ｋey)價格最廉的，也須二三元左右，本文所介紹的，祇須化費大洋數分，便可製成。</p>
<p>大號木製的衣夾一個，用螺釘旋在木板上，再在尾端裝上螺釘兩枚。（見附圖Ａ，Ｂ，）使用時，按捺撳鉦卽行。如欲變更接觸點之距離，可調節螺釘Ａ之螺絲帽。</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>在北方這菜有個別名，喚做「響鈴」；意思是形容它脆得可以給人家嚼出聲音來。所以這一樣菜總是做得愈鬆脆爲愈好，而年老的人便因爲牙齒的殘缺，只得望着它嘆氣了。</p>
<p>到了太后暮年的時候，櫻桃肉便奪取了「響鈴」的位置，一變而爲太后所特別中意的一碗菜了。它的製法是先把上好的猪肉，切成棋子般大的小塊，加上了調味品，便和新鮮的櫻桃，丨丨在沒有新鮮櫻桃的時候，便把已經蜜餞或用其他方法製過的櫻桃，放在溫水裏浸着，浸得它跟新鮮的一樣好看，一樣鮮嫩。丨丨一起裝在一個白磁罐裏，加些淸水，讓它放在文火上慢慢地煨着；大約隔上十個鐘頭，肉也酥了，櫻桃的香味也煮出來了，這樣就可以給貪嘴的人們恣意飽啖了。尤其是它的湯，眞的美到極點！</p>
<p>宮裏所常吃的幾種蔬菜之中，太后比較最歡喜的是「豌豆」。豌豆總是在極嫩的時候摘下的，所以不但它的滋味是很淸爽，便是看它的色相，像一顆顆綠珠似的堆在白色的磁碗裏，也很容易引起你的食慾來。蘿蔔這樣東西，原是沒有資格可以混入御膳中來的，因爲宮裏面的人向來對它非常輕視，以爲只是平民的食品，或竟是餵養牲畜用的，絕對不能用來褻辱太后；後來不知怎樣，竟爲太后自己所想了起來，伊就吩咐監管御膳房的太監去弄來嘗新。也虧那些廚夫眞聰明，好容易竟把蘿蔔原有的那股氣味，一齊都榨去了；再把它配在火腿湯或雞鴨的濃湯裏，那滋味便當然不會差了！</p>
<h3>蘇州玄妙觀的神話</h3>
<p>— 南宮生</p>
<p>提起了蘇州「玄妙觀」，誰都知道是蘇州的一處有名所在。其實，也不過同上海城隍廟，是一個百貨小商塲而已。但是，關於「玄妙」觀的神話，却特別的多，最著名的！便是「三淸殿」和「沒字碑」「大水盂」。</p>
<p>「三淸殿」是「玄妙觀」中央的一處大殿，裏面供養的當然是名符其實的三淸菩薩丨老子丨元始天尊丨通天敎主。三個神像的高度，是有着十餘丈的長短，頭頂着屋樑，坐身的蓮花寶座，却是着地造起，偉大可知，關於「三淸殿」的神話，便在這三個神像身上，相傳在起初時候，「三淸殿」中，祇有兩尊神像，第三尊的加塑，却因了座下是一個水泉穴口，從這泉口，一直可以通到東洋大海，所以塑這尊第三尊神像，便是仗着三淸菩薩的靈威，來鎭住這泉眼，不然，全蘇州城，就得被海水行一個洗禮，因此，有一句神話，呌做「三淸佛倒，蘇州城了」，究竟是否靈騐，因三淸佛也沒有倒過，自然是不得而知了。</p>
<p>「沒字碑」是劉伯溫所立鎭住蘇州城的風水，因了太湖的形勢，比了蘇州城地勢高了許多，沒有了這塊「沒字碑」，太湖的水，就得倒灌入城，蘇州人都得做了魚龜，有了這一句神話，所以這「沒字碑」。到了如今，還是卓立在「三淸殿」的後面，「中山堂」的側面，沒有敢去動他一動。</p>
<p>「大水盂」也在「三淸殿」的後面，據說「玄妙觀」裏面，泉眼共有兩個，一個在三淸佛的座下，一個便是那「大水盂」了，所以不論是水旱冬夏，這「大水盂」內的水，沒有一天乾過，就是通泉眼的鐵證，但是，如今到「玄妙觀」去，可以瞧到「大水盂」內，已經完全變了磚土，沒有一些淸泉的形踪了，這句神話，顯見得已成了過去。「三淸殿」和「沒字碑」，一則因了神像太高，沒人可以動他，一則關係太大，沒有敢去嘗試，究竟是否同神話相符，那可不得而知的了。</p>
<h3>修腦術</h3>
<p>— 羅懦俠</p>
<p>日前本報國際電載：「列寗格勒」外科學院移腦手術成功，據說：『：：：從一年輕女子的腦子裏，移去像鴿蛋一般大小的腺瘤一枚，因爲那瘤若果大起來，便會使伊失明，瘤的部位，是距離中心神經數米喱，施手術的外科醫生，仗他生平本領，能够把腦搬開，割去腺瘤，可算是醫學界的創聞』云云，其實手術治腦的成績，不自今日始，我國說部早有記述：就是淸乾隆時代，齊召南文士，跌破腦漿，醫生拿馬腦替他補上，雖然沒有死去，可是靈性失掉，以前讀過的書，一點都忘記了。這是一件事。</p>
<p>聽說二十年前舊金山，有妙齡女郎喚做「珍奈琶，」犯了偷竊罪，給警察捉去，伊的父親是個富商，將伊保釋後，想必是染有神經病，不然，怎麼會這樣的糊塗？便請名醫替伊沼療，醫生檢驗一回，說：伊在幼年時候，跌壞了腦部，所以裏面橫生着腐骨，阻礙原有天良，那便幹出不顧利害的勾當，後來經醫生剖割修理，果然不上十天，便把惡根性除去。那又是一件事。</p>
<p>綜此兩端，和現在的所謂移腦手術成功，祇好說是「前後相輝映」罷了。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第三十一回三次交鋒白衣衝雪陣　全營殉國赤眼入槍林</p>
<p>但是無論飛到怎樣低，在這樣滿地積雪的山溝裏，藏着一連白衣白帽的人，在極快的時間，實在辦不出來。因之那飛機來回飛了三四次，上面偵察的人，把軍隊也當了白雪，以爲沒有什麼可以注意的，並不曾放下炸彈，竟自去了。不過它帶了炸彈來，决不能還帶了回去。遙遙的聽到幾下哄通的嚮聲，可以知道這炸彈，改投到堡子裏去了。自强伏在雪地上，靜靜的等着那飛機聲完全消失以後，這才站了起來。等着隊伍都站立起來了，這才用手扯了兩扯衣襟，正色向北兄道：我們當軍人的，不應當怕死，我這樣小心，你們不要誤會了，以爲連長也害怕起來了。你要知道，我們今天奉了命令出來，還有最大的事情，回頭要辦，我們要不怕，留着回頭不怕。現在，我可以把我們要辦的事，對弟兄們說一一。我們營長，是個老營務。軍事學術好極了。昨天他知道了敵人的兵很少，决不能攻進堡子去，故意把這裏的防綫放鬆了。今天，敵人更是會走這條路來。他來了，你們別驚慌，我若沒有命令，你們誰也別放出一粒子彈去。等到我呌你們動手殺賊的時候，你們就拚了命衝出去。殺一個敵人，咱們就够對拚的了，殺兩個呢，咱們就撈本啦。今天晚上咱們殺過去了，明天口子裏的援兵，也就可以趕到，你瞧，我們今天晚上先打他一個措手不及，那豈不是白撈？衆弟兄那裏懂得什麼，連長說是能白撈，大家也就壯着胆子等這個白撈的機會。這時，太陽越發的偏落下去了，只覺這山夾溝裏，寒氣逼人，身上　　　要料顧起來。（四二二）</p>

<h3>富春鰣與黃山松</h3>
<p>— 大塊</p>
<p>人但慕松江之鱸，而鮮及富春之鰣。惟武林遺事嘗載：「∶∶每歲五月，富春江上，鰣魚最盛。徽人捕之，移時百里，達於城巿，或云：此魚自漢江來，非富春產也。富春上下游，非夏則無此，人以爲奇。」其實夏初乃鰣產生之時，隨春潮至，遂爲七里瀧之雋品。徽人過此，未有不一快朶頤者。</p>
<p>魚形扁而長，大者三尺餘，色白如銀，多脂肪，味甚美；惟肉中多細刺，離水卽死，死則味遜，故必在舟中始得嘗之。徽航船戶，皆善烹此。今汽車路通，此種風味，當不易得。更幾春秋，「七里瀧吃鰣魚，」恐將成爲父老口中之掌故矣。</p>
<p>徽杭路通，黃山道上，漸多遊屐。本山出品，得一般雅人逸士之垂靑，三生有幸而作東遊者，當以松爲最。籐篋手杖之間，翠綠　　，玲瓏嬌小，固皆初離山野甫到人間之物。山靈有知，得勿吝愔？</p>
<p>其實；松之最上者，多在懸崖峭壁，取之絕難。次，亦以生石上者爲佳，生泥上中者最下。普通所售，多中下品。或以人工拗之使曲折，旣失自然，且不耐久。松針以短，密，銳，（刺手）爲上，普通葉皆雙股，聞天都連花間有三股五股者，但不易得。</p>
<p>栽松須用黃泥，當置陽光充足之地，乾燥無妨，最忌潮濕，每屆新陳代謝時，須剪去黃葉，毌使自落，自落，則新　　　　且綠褐圓雜，亦欠美觀。</p>
<h3>眞正老上海及其藝人</h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>「控江而淮浙輻輳；　　連海而閩楚交通；　　：：：：：：：：　　巿𠪨雜夷夏之人；　　𧶡貨當東南之物。　　：：：：：：：」</p>
<p>上面所引的，是宋代詩人應熙靑龍鎭賦文中的兩句。古人筆端帶着情感的文字就算不免誇大，讓我們來打個對折吧，也得有百分之五十的對。那麼，這靑龍鎭似乎不很平凡的了。但是靑龍鎭到底是一個什麼所在呢？</p>
<p>却說，這靑龍鎭，原來正是老上海。</p>
<p>相傳吳孫權曾造靑龍戰艦，置其地，故名靑龍。唐天寶五年（七四六），始設鎭。宋代，爲華亭縣地。元代，上海立縣後，分屬上海。明代，屬靑浦。</p>
<p>志乘上告訴了我這老上海的精糙的輪廓，中間並特別提出來說：</p>
<p>「：：在宋時，鎭爲海舶輻輳地，有三亭，七塔，十三寺，烟火萬家，人稱小杭州。」</p>
<p>老上海還有小杭州的芳名。看起來，雖然沒有現在的上海，得到「東方巴黎」榮譽的震赫一時，但在千年左右以前，老上海的靑龍鎭的繁華却是無疑的了。</p>
<p>據說，那時靑龍鎭人有個李甲別號景元的，能畫；並善作詩，塡詞，爲蘇東坡所稱賞。東坡曾題李的喜鵲圖詩云：</p>
<p>「聞說神仙郭忠恕，醉中狂筆勢瀾翻。　　百年寥落人何在？只有華亭李景元。」</p>
<p>原籍並非靑龍鎭而寄庽靑龍鎭的，有個李無悔，別號行中。他過着閑適生活，寄情詩酒，並自己起築了一所幽雅的園子。他並不做官，也不拿津貼，但很被那時名宦推重。蘇東坡曾代他的園裏一座亭題名「醉眠」；並作詩送給他。和韻的，有蘇子由，秦少游，張子野等人。</p>
<p>常時往來靑龍鎭的，有個名詩人梅聖俞。除靑龍雜記外，他還做一首靑龍江上觀潮詩，略云：</p>

<h3>關於大衆語的建設</h3>
<p>— 樊仲雲</p>
<p>白話文運動十五年，又聽到文言抬頭的呼聲，不是一件怪事嗎？可是不，在這馬褂得興的今日，這正是意想中事。</p>
<p>白話文運動是戰後受民族自决主義的影響，中國民族資產階級要求革新並建立現代中國的表現。可是這種要求，在國際資本主義的巨大壓力下，馬上給摧毀了。於是在一方面，白話文運動立卽成爲整理國故運動，在他方面，則不過把封建的才子佳人的小說，改變成爲摩登男女的戀愛描寫。白話文運動在把「之乎者也」改成「的那嗎呢」之後、就從此終止了。</p>
<p>因此之故、這所謂白話文者、其實與文言沒有什麽不同。這沒有與一般大衆打成一片，且不消說，還有他的根本的意識，也與文言相同，爲封建的，享樂的，消費的，剝削的。所以這種白話文之應加改造，是不必多說的。但欲不蹈過去的覆轍，問題來了。㈠是意識問題，屬於思想的表現，㈡是智識問題，屬於內容的充實，我覺得用語問題，還是第三，但這三者必須同時並進，事乃可成。</p>
<p>一方面是要使白話文成爲一般大衆生動的語言，一方面則現在大衆的思想，不脫陰騭文感應篇的支配，而智識方面，其水準之低，我們也不必諱言，在這一點上，他們簡直是一張白紙。所以必須輸入新智識，以豐富其語彙，介紹新思想，以改正其意識。待至智識充實，思想正確，白話文與大衆語，我的意思以爲自然會彼此接近的。</p>
<p>講到智識的傳布與思想的矯正，那末敎科用書以外，要數報章與雜誌。但今日敎科用書，像過去的白話文樣，很多只是文言的翻譯，而現今的報紙，尤滿紙是封建意識的表現。譬如記男女問題，不曰「陳倉暗度，已非一日，」卽曰「珠胎暗結，大腹便便」記其他新聞，也多關於個人，如某某於某時由京專車啟行，送者某某等，幾時到某處，迎者某某等之類，如某社開會於某處，到者某某等。很少指出這事件的社會的意義。總括一句：新聞記載的公式化，就是由於中文言的毒太深了。</p>
<p>因此白話文運動雖已十五年，而一般大衆還是沒有可資閱讀的書物。但他們旣然已認識文字，就要讀書，不得已，只好到水滸傳紅樓夢等舊小說中去求滿足，或者看些啼笑姻緣武俠小說之類，或者新一點，讀新禮拜六的戀愛小說。由這種低級趣味，於是小報盛行，黃色新聞主義支配了整個的新聞界。</p>
<p>說起來這個現象的造成，還是由於白話文運動之半途中止。所以今後從事文化運動，我們應當知道必須先使一般大衆有可讀的東西，只有這樣，纔能斷絕文言的殘餘勢力，消滅一切爲消費，享樂的封建意識所凝結成功的低級趣味。</p>
<p>建設大衆語文學，我們要求先合於大衆需要的讀物。</p>
<h3>兩種錯覺</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>汪懋祖先生論「禁習文言與强令讀經，」覺得一般靑年寫作程度低落，非重新讀文言做文言不可。汪先生雖說是敎育家，於國文敎學一道到底是外行，不獨是外行，簡直隔靴搔癢，一無是處。</p>
<p>一般關心敎育的人，常有兩種錯覺；有的忘記了自己從前的寫作程度，以爲現代靑年的寫作程度格外低落。有的忘記了寫作文言的不通成分，以爲一應不通成分都由習白話文而來。我姑且退一步，承認一般的寫作程度低落，白話文的不通成分比文言文更多，而汪先生應負的責任更加重起來。各地中等學校校長聘請國文敎員，偏向於舊的。大都聘請所謂「宿儒」，偏向於新的大都聘請所謂「作家」。以宿儒來講解現代國文敎本，他能講些什麽。不但不能講解莫泊桑月夜那類名著，卽赫胥黎天演論，亦瞠目不知所解。可是說到古書，又知道得有限，經學但憑朱註，史學誰知左傳；修辭學，文章學·更是門外漢。這類私塾冬烘坯子，會指示靑年以語文的正確智識與寫作技術嗎？至說吹得肥兒泡般美麗的作家，只是聲名洋溢於中國而已，呌他担任國文敎程，古的旣不會講，今的又無從講；我所知道的有幾位作家敎授，在講台上講點軼事，議論點時事，把時間消磨過就算了。這樣能把靑年的語言程度提高嗎？國文敎學，乃是敎書匠的專業，並不是三部講章，八斗天才能應付裕如的。所以靑年的語文上如有什麽缺點，卽是中等學校校長，誤聘國文敎員之過，汪懋祖先生卽是不能逃其責之一的人。</p>
<p>至說靑年的一般語文程度，那又非汪懋祖先生之所知。我且引古以喻今：方苞，姚鼐，桐城派之大師也，序跋銘誌文字，楚楚可觀；一涉及邦國大政，卽疵謬百出，其論邊防事務，簡直是大話柄。我最愛歸有光文，而其大幅文字，卽無足觀者。桐城諸文家，惟曾國藩大幅文字，洋灑可喜。可見議論文字，與閱歷經騐有關，且非中年以後，不能有深切觀察。如以「國難期間靑年應有之責任」「讀書不忘愛國，愛國不忘讀書」一類題目，考察學生語文程度，除門面話外無可說，當然難得差强人意。其實，以此類題目着令方苞姚鼐限時交卷，也不會有好文字寫出來。歐洲大陸的大學入學國文試題，大都是「朝霞」，「街頭」這類切實可寫題目，决不注重空論。（我前天在某中學看見「禮義廉恥論」的國文試題，這個試題用「論」字卽不通，應用「說」或用「義」字。以此試題，請汪先生試作一篇，我敢說汪先生未必能做出什么好文章來）現代靑年，見聞廣於舊時；其所學習諸科，皆養成組織能力，故語文程度，比從前文人的確高明得多。我曾經仔細研究過這個問題：古書讀得愈少，語文程度愈高；古書讀得愈多，語文程度愈低；謂予不信</p>
<p>，可以實地試騐。（至以別字多寡，字蹟優劣作語文標準，雙當別論。）</p>
<p>還有一種遺誤靑年的普遍觀念，就是一般敎育家所謂「國英算並重」。語文程度的高下與常識多寡成正比；前人謂知人論時，歷史的知識不豐富，議論文卽難健全。蘇洵六國論，舊推名作，由今觀之，荒謬可笑；買誼過棄，千古流傳；按其實際，亦多乖說；此皆不知史事之過。切實地說罷，國英算愈並重，靑年對於其他學程，愈無暇兼顧，則常識愈缺乏，因而語文愈不能進步；惟有讓他們多得一點常識，活用他們的思考力，語文水準方有提高的希望。</p>
<h3>新聞記者席</h3>
<p>— 二菴</p>
<h3>論重譯及其他（上）</h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>在我的那舊「各盡所能」之中，我提出來反對重譯。</p>
<p>中國現代，的確是有些離奇的事實。如劉廷芳博士以英文譯本譯梅特林的戲曲一類事體，，在中國不還是屢見不鮮麽？我想，如劉廷芳博士一類的英文程度相當好的人，與其譯梅特林，倒還是從英文譯點英美文學作品好些。</p>
<p>在我以爲英文程度好的人似應當多譯點英美學作品，不必舍其所長，去就所短，而從英文譯法文學作品。學法文學的，應當多譯些法文學作品，而不必從法文譯本中間接地譯英美文學。我以爲，對於英美法日諸國的文學，是須要直接繙繹的。自然，俄國文學，德國文學，是相當地須要從英法諸國文字繙繹，而西班牙意大利波蘭以及諸弱小民族的作品，是除了間接地繙譯別無辦法。在「各盡所能」中，我所說的那句「如果不得已時，是可以許可的」，就是指着繙譯意，西，波，諸國文學時而言。</p>
<p>關於間接繙繹，我們還是有好些點要注意的。第一，是譯本之批判問題。我是從法文本譯過湼維洛夫的「塔什干」的，可是去年看見該書的德譯本，比法譯本分量多過幾乎有一倍。而路易梭的「戰爭」的法譯本，好像刪了一大章。又如日本的有些繙譯本頭裏，日本文就不大通順。這是不是很可注意的問題呢？譯本的批判，是很重要的。馬宗融先生現在是從法譯本，譯「唐吉訶德」，他有兩種法譯本，可是兩種法譯本不同之處甚多。這不作批判又怎麽辦呢？去年讀沈起予先生譯的「歐洲文學發達史」。那是根據着較良好的日譯本，沈起予先生的譯文</p>
<p>也是相當地忠實的。然而依然是還有一些好笑的錯誤。譬如，論及維尼的「狼之死」時，日譯者作「狼」字音譯爲「Woruku」，大槪是當作固有的人名看待了，而沈起予先生就未加批判地音譯爲「阿爾克」。我初看時，莫明其妙，想不起在維尼的哪篇東西中有這位阿爾克人物。可是去看下文，才知道是狼(Loup)。誰知這條狼旅行到俄國，再旅行到日本，更旅行到中國就變成爲阿爾克先生了。此點，自然是日譯者的錯過。譯本的批判工夫，是特別要注意的！</p>
<p>譯本的批判工夫不作，而馬馬虎虎地去作間接的繙譯的工作，結果，是有毛病的。如王任叔先生的居友的「社會學的藝術論」（大江）一類的東西，是對社會有害的。數年來，想從原文直接繙譯居友者，據我所知，不下三五人，其中不少在語學上在文學修養上都爲健全的人，可是，王任叔先生的劣譯一出，好譯本雖有，也不大會有發表的機會了。（在我以爲，王任叔先生才能尙多，不必從井上勇的日譯本只譯了那部書的上半）。然而如果根據較好的日譯本，（大西，小方的譯本），也會好得多，我以爲，我們應盡量地去提介直接繙譯，而不得已時，是需要間接地繙譯的。但是，要愼重行事，最好是根據兩國文字以上的譯本。而實在萬不得已時，是可以講權變的辦法的。</p>
<h3>舊貨翻新傳</h3>
<p>— 紅蓼</p>
<p>從某一個時期起，上海的舊貨商店，頗投世人所好，突然興旺起來。我有許多朋友，是一些舊貨商店裏的老主顧。據他們跑舊貨店的經騐，是：雖然有便宜可貪，但究竟貨色不及新的好。</p>
<p>舊貨商店，是專門以舊貨翻新，而又以低價出售來哄人的；許多人爲了貪小便宜，都趨之若騖　這當然，裏頭也含着都巿不景氣的原素。但是舊貨翻新的興旺；並不是一種好現象，却成爲自明的眞理。</p>
<p>放開眼界，看一看我們文壇，舊貨翻新之風，不是方在暗中發展嗎？這是不是一種好現象？</p>
<p>偶讀「老子」「易經」，便把一些自己也弄不懂意義的字眼，彙集成篇，向未曾讀過古書的靑年，賣野人頭：吟一遍納蘭詞，定盫詩，便也大書其讀後感，甚或强行插入自己的意識，此其一。閱紅樓水滸，或野叟曝言，便也硬把內容剪裁一段，加以渲染，成爲新的創作，此其二。此外，如翻印古書，加以標點，附以八股式的批註。這樣，大家都汲汲乎於舊貨翻新的工作，自以爲這是一種另闢門路的新花樣了。但究竟這是不是急要的工作呢？</p>
<p>五四文學革命時，文壇上是如何地發揚篷勃，白話文的提倡，舊詩的推翻，這種新文學運動，是曾經得過許多靑年們底熱烈擁戴的，現在，這舊貨翻新的工作，和五四文學革命時代的精神，相離的多遠呢！九一八之後，接連着一二八，國難重重；文壇也隨着顯出頹萎之勢，這何異於大家拋却現實生活，羣向着墳墓裏跑！</p>
<p>讀書，有的也以一種嗜好爲出發點，（因爲我根本反對爲吃飯而讀書，或是爲名利等而讀書的。）我們不能强制他人的嗜好，所以有價値的舊文學，或是僅供消遣的舊書，我們不能强禁其他個人的流覽及研究。但個人嗜好的瀏覽研究之後，又何必盛爲宣傳呢？寫詩詞讀後隨感，或是介紹古小說的幽逸文筆，是不是現代靑年們所需要的文學修養呢？現實生活中替我們預備下多少可以採作文藝創作的材料。一些作家們，爲什麽竟拋開現實，而偏要跑向空虛之路上去呢？</p>
<p>舊貨翻新的工作，是暴露作家們實生活體騐的缺乏，才這樣避重就輕地走向襲取的這條小徑上去。這和舊貨商店的興旺，一樣地是不景氣的結果。</p>
<p>文壇上的舊貨翻新，可以引誘靑年到舊紙堆裏去，而忘記了現實。我們爲了挽救文壇的頹萎，我們應當肅淸這避重就輕，逃避現實的工作。我們需要的，是富於時代及創作精神的東西！</p>
<h3>私奔（四）</h3>
<p>— 匈牙利·沛妥斐著施詠沂譯</p>
<p>在安娜夫人和她的侄兒卡爾出奔之後六個月，一個靑年忽然出現在老安德羅的家談。他的臉上顯現着受苦似的和失望的情調。</p>
<p>老安德羅帶着悽凉的心境剛從他的俱樂部回來。他正爲了他年輕的妻子的失蹤，還有和牧師着棋失敗而悲傷着。</p>
<p>當這靑年進來的時候，那老人，臉色顯得蒼白而且渾身戰憟着，沉倒在他的椅子裏。那靑年握着他的手申請道：</p>
<p>「叔父丨丨親愛的叔父丨丨我怎樣才能得到你的寬恕呢？我準備着聽從你的辦法！」</p>
<p>「她在什麽地方丨丨那女人？」</p>
<p>「她丨丨她丨丨不在這裏。」</p>
<p>老人深深地嘆了一口安慰似的氣。</p>
<p>「我要把這件事情原原本本地告訴你，」卡爾說。「你看，你應該可憐我，不要以爲我是一個仇敵。我不能告訴你我受了怎樣的苦楚。我的幸福並沒有長久，我生活在一個眞正的地獄裏，你的妻子有一副天使般的臉丨丨但是她的心裏却深藏着一切的惡意。是我平生所知道的一個最壞的女人。我不能再和她同居下去丨丨我已經離棄了她丨丨」</p>
<p>「我可憐的侄兒丨丨我得眞心地可憐你。但是你也應該可憐我：你還不過和她同居了六個月，而我却和她住了整整的一年呢。」</p>
<p>「你，也很苦痛嗎，親愛的叔父？」</p>
<p>「我想你很覺得奇怪吧，是不是？每個人都以爲我們是幸福的。但是當我們同居着的時候，你應該看得出來的，那時丨丨你總得知道一兩椿事情的。只要一想到了她，我就覺得戰憟了。當我知道你和她逃走的時候，我很感謝你，沒有一個人比你對待我更仁慈了。爲了要報酬你丨丨當一個商人來告訴我你們的行蹤的時候丨丨於是我就每年結你一注津貼，丨丨這樣可以使你不想再回來並且不致於感受經濟的困難丨丨（完）</p>
<h3>夜漁</h3>
<p>— 吳汶</p>
<p>夜，月下的港灣，妻細數着對岸的漁火。一點，兩點：：：蘆叢中。凝着黃豆般的燐光。靜水驀裊着銀蛇，兩人合力地撈起層網。一尾尖刀般的魚，躍着，又輕輕地漏去。失望，成爲慣了的事，幸虧妻已趕織着新網。哭了，烏蓬底下的孩子，妻丟我一人苦守在艙口。微風起，午夜的潮漲了，隔船傳來魚躍的聲。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>文言，白話，大衆語</h3>
<p>— 白兮</p>
<p>我們第一得注意，在目前提倡建設大衆語，而把文言文跟白話文一槪在拋棄之例的緣故，因爲胡適時代的白話文運動，沒有積極的把文言文完全拋棄，反之，却跟文言文勾搭上了，而實行了妥恊，因此在目前提供建設大衆語，是必然的要把文言文跟白話文完全拋棄，</p>
<p>我們第二得注意，在反對文言文復興的當中，我們的所以要拋棄白話文的緣故，因爲第一，白話文旣與文言文相妥恊，當然這白話文裏邊所含的質素，已不是純粹的白話文的質素了，他是已變成了個文不文白不白的「雜種」了，第二，白話文旣是跟文言文相妥恊，而停留在不變的途徑中，同時，大衆的生活，却因着時代的推動而向前猛進了，當然，雜種的白話文，不配大衆的現在生活，這是必然的要把白話文陳列到歷史博物館裏去了，</p>
<p>我們第三得注意，我們的提倡大衆語，必定要儘量的「用各地的方言來連綴成文，」因爲「方言」跟現代中國普通話，」（見六月二十六日的申報自由談猛克先生所引的宋陽先生的話，（按現代中國普通話就是大衆話）雖然互相對立，但在一定的條件之下，也可以相互浸透，「要使現代中國普通話」整個的提高，非先提高各種「方言」不可，各種「方言」發展到了一定的程度，就可以互相浸透而成爲「現代中國普通話」。我們使「方言」發達，但是那種發達，同時是使「方言」死滅，是準備融合「方言」爲「現代中國普通話」的條件，從這裏我想可以使垢佛先生跟猛克先生稍稍釋疑一點了吧。</p>
<p>第四我們得注意，我們目前提倡建設大衆語，而所以要拋棄（我認爲拋棄比較打倒妥當），文言文跟白話文，而把那「文言文」跟「白話文」如垢佛先生所說的「渾爲一談」者，因爲白話文旣跟文言文相妥恊了，當然旣拋棄白話文，必然同時也是要拋棄文言文的，所以這倒並不使讀者「眼花撩亂口難言」我們曉得五四的革命，並不曾整個的把封建餘孽完全剷除呀！：：：</p>
<p>以上四點，是讀了垢佛先生在昨天本刊上談言中發表的「文言和白話論戰宣言」而寫下了的，廿四分的希望大家來討論，使這問題能展開上去，而能得到一個完美的結論，</p>
<h3>大衆語</h3>
<p>— 潤鳳</p>
<p>我才知道，大衆語須從勞勤階級出來的，因此我昨天特地坐了黃包車，到楊樹浦的工廠區域，去採訪大衆語，因爲不曉得大衆語，到底怎樣一種言語，我一步踏進××工廠，立刻看見有兩位勞工朋友，正在談話，我如獲至寶似的，馬上走上去，站立一傍，靜聽他們談話，茲將他們兩人所說的話，筆述如下。</p>
<p>甲說老三丨錯那娘，昨日（音如熱以下仿此）小江北到我堂來挨血，我說老爺叔，饒了我罷，地（地就是這的意思）幾日我袋袋裏畢跌生斯，正辣浪想尋幾個朋友，挨點血來用用，啥塲化血來借儂（鼻音）用。</p>
<p>小江北就回答我說，倉那！你要漂亮點，朋友後日總有碰頭的日脚，今朝到你堂來挨血，還（曖字音）是看得起儂，不曉得儂狗𤻋，我認得儂，</p>
<p>老三丨你替我想想，氣不氣，這兩日我的血，眞是一點無末，伊就是要我堂來挨點血，亦應該客氣一點，伊的吞頭，我到有點不領朋，</p>
<p>乙說阿六哥丨倉那娘，你不要說，江北的賊脾氣，一向如此，舊年亦到我家裏來挨血，亦是値價慢爺面孔，本我駡伊一頓，以後就勿曾來過，後來看見我，總是勃轉頭，假做不看見，倉那娘，阿賴自然亦不去睬他，我怕伊奈亨，</p>
<p>晚（愛字音）歇罷，新民樓吃茶，</p>
<h3>暑期臨了怎樣？丨獻呈學生讀者丨</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>歲月如流，暑假瞬屆！我們當敎職員的正惴惴於飯碗又發生了問題；而學生們則無不喜形于色，雀躍三百。這在中國，彷彿已成爲歷史上的註脚，凡假期都是玩的，「假期」無異是「玩日」兩個字眼。現已溽暑蒸人，湍度竟達百度以上，這無疑的大家正眼巴巴望着這暑假到臨，好來一回舒適的休息。</p>
<p>這，我們不但表示反對，而且覺得有無限隱憂。質言之，從這裏可以鮮明的看出中國民族性上的一個弱點丨，偷閒偷懶，我們知道，學生正是年少力强，精神煥發，怎容得只管偷閒偷懶？卽着眼于各方面說，一般服務社會的人，並沒有什麽暑假寒假的休息，工塲裏整日整年揮灑血汗的苦力，更不知怎樣呌做暑假，（除非是長期的失業，但也得努力掙扎）我們學生僅僅四個月來每天三五小時課就眞的辛苦不堪，必要一番長期的休養麽？這無論怎樣也是說不過去的。</p>
<p>我們認爲學年中的暑假或寒假，不過是課堂學業的一個結束，不過是時間的長度上的一個記號，並不是塡出來給大家玩的。我們也並不借用大的晃子，說什麽「國難臨頭」，大家須要「臥薪嘗胆」。只是靠着事實說老實話，暑假並不是給我們玩的，我們學生沒有玩的需要，我們應努力于學業的研究，努力于身心的修養，努力于社會的體認，努力　于前程的打算。在學生的字彙中，只有努力」「前進」有沒「偷懶」，「休息」，這是我們應該深切認識的。</p>
<p>大前提旣經確定，我們且來展開下面的論次。</p>
<p>因爲中國敎育的不普及，也因爲中國地面的遼闊和交通的不方便，所以現有的幾所學校，都是開辦在大埠重鎭，在鄕間除了不完備的小學而外，是找不到大學中學的。學校雖辦在城裏，但城裏並沒有多少學生。大部份還是從鄕間出來的。正因爲如此，我就要提出一個口號，學生在暑假中，「回到農村去」！我這裏並不是一般的論調，要學生去肩負復興農村的責任的。而是呌學生到農村去更進一步的努力修業。綱領如后：</p>
<p>㈠鄕村的讀書環境好我們知道，</p>

<p>都巿因人烟稠密，社會複雜，處處都是囂張與混亂，誘惑與牽制，其實是一點都不適宜于年靑學生努力讀書。只有鄕村是淳眞樸素，幽靜宜人，所以盧騷一輩大哲學家是極力主張回到自然去。學生們正應以暑假可以離校的機會，回到農村去。順應着優美的自然環境，去努力于學業的進修。</p>
<p>㈡去體認眞實的社會現在彷彿大家都在呌着，中國是到了滿城風雨的境地，最危險的就是農村的根本破產。然而我想這恐怕大家只會這樣呌，究竟農村破產到何等程度，社會的眞實瑞究竟怎樣，誰都不很淸楚。尤其是學生們，吃得好，穿得好，晚上睡得貼貼服服，正像深院裏的宮女，鼓裏的虫子，對于社會的一切，是摸不着頭腦。就因爲這樣，在學的時候，當然不知怎樣去努力，離開學校以後，更不知怎樣去謀改造。暑假正是一個很好的樣會，給我們到農村裏去實地體認社會的究竟。而且在敎育上我們可以說，社會是一所大學堂，我們從這大學堂裏實地得來的知識是要更爲貴重。</p>
<p>㈢看看父母的辛勞和學費來源的困難現在的一般學生，一離開了家庭，就模糊不淸了。在學校裏只管受着經濟困難，錢不够用，甚至有此學生因此埋怨父母，這是多麽的不應該呵！父母担負子女的敎育經費，當然是應該的，但子女亦當克儉以報，尤其應對父母有一種特殊的諒解。試看看父母在鄕間是如何的辛苦，胼手胝足，節衣縮食，在這種農村破產的時候，學費的籌措，更是如何的困難。學生們應于暑假回到家裏深切的去考察一番。</p>
<p>我個人是極力主張暑期學生回鄕，</p>
<p>所得的利益，無論在學識方面，身心方面，認識方面，都無可限量。如有因特別情形不能回鄕者，亦應利用這長期的暑假，走進圖書館用一番苦功，跑到工塲式貧民窟裏去多做實際的社會調查。若是每日吃飽了飯，就放肆的玩，或者在床上整日的睡，那是絕對的不應該。至于詳細的計劃，怎樣的去利用，支配時間，那是各個自己的事，我也毌勞多贅。事實上擬出來也是不中用的。</p>
<h3>自信與成功</h3>
<p>— 田菴</p>
<p>「物必無腐，而後蟲生之：：：」一類的老生常談，雖然是卑之無甚高論，但亦未始不說出了一部分至理。一個人，假設是自己和自己過不去，自甘下流的話，是絕難希望得到他人之尊視與同情的。這正是所謂「自作孽，不可活，」咎由自取，也怪不了誰。可惜的，只是大好一生，白白斷送太値不得而已。</p>
<p>人生中的成功與失敗，個人的向上努力與否，是有决定的意義的。在兒童時期，人像一張白紙，染於蒼則蒼，染於黃則黃，自己不能意識到自己的眞實地位，常是把別人當自己，比如把別人的意見當作自己的意見等等。兒童常缺乏自信力，總調着自己的軟弱，自甘於作父母長輩的附庸。這乃是身體發育上的必有階段，我們不能因此說兒童是不求長進的，而否定了他們的遠大前途。事實上年齒的增加是逐漸充實了他們的身體外觀，也加强了他們的內在精神，特別是自信的精神有高速的發展。這自然也有例外，我們只要看成人中也有許多和小孩一樣缺乏自信力而過着軟弱可悲的生活，就不難明瞭的了。</p>
<p>我們的社會地位却和兒童不同，是由我們自己來决定的。社會上有許多「模子」，要把我們揑成各式各樣的人，我們是有權取捨的。人們不能任意把我們揑成壞蛋，同樣也不能把我們揑成聖賢。我們有權利把自己揑造成怎樣一個人。我們可以向上，也可以向下，繫之於我們自信的程度。自信常决定一個人能成功與否。自信常是成功的要件，勇幹力行的原動力。</p>
<p>這使得我們在生活態度上須得重新有一翻厘定。對於一個富有自信心而想努力向上的人；他該怎樣在社會中處理自己的生活？他將驕傲嗎？擺架子嗎？丨像許多富有自信心的人那樣？這是一條碰壁的路，誰都看出牠的危險的。那末，他將常在嘴邊掛着「你老！」「不敢！」「在下，」「：：：」等一連串的謙詞，口口聲聲的說着客氣話嗎？這是沒骨頭的軟性表現，是缺乏自信力的人失敗的進奏。他這樣會遭到別人的輕視。他好像很講禮貌，但講禮貌也要有一個　　，即客氣，謙虛，也要有一個限度。太客氣太謙虛了不行，他不可失掉了自己獨立自尊的立塲。俗話說得好。「君子自重」。一個富有自信心的人雖不必要作一個封建性的君子或紳士，但「自重」却是人生處世不可或無的天經地義。只有自己尊重自己，看得起自己，才能得到他人的尊重，他人的看得起。一個缺乏獨立自尊的人格的人，是必然要爲他人所看輕，如奴僕，娼妓，：：都是很好的例子。自信，和由自信而生的自尊與自重，才是往成功之路去的指路標呵！</p>
<p>記住呵！只有自己看得起自己，別人也才看得起自己呵！</p>
<h3>財寶</h3>
<p>— 中朔</p>
<p>天氣陰霾，滿天的大霧布滿了周圍，風聲詐響，有些刺入。</p>
<p>財寶才紳就爬起來了，暗澹的臉上，悒鬱的神情顯露着，蹲在地上，看着財寶嫂一件又一件地翻着衣服，每翻到一件較値錢些的，就躊躇一陣。</p>
<p>「穀價是如此的賤！地租又是一年重似一年！上年剩下來的幾擔粗穀直到上月才吃完，這也算够儉省的了，天要絕人又怎奈何！」財寶把慣發的幾句牢騷又吐了出來。</p>
<p>財寶嫂把較値錢幾件衣服包在一起，聽了這幾句話只「唉」的嘆了一聲。</p>
<p>財寶將預備走，財寶嫂又撩過一件穿過兩三次的嶄新土布棉襖來，陰鬱的說：</p>
<p>「這也　了去！」</p>
<p>「留下　　！新的包去了可惜！」</p>
<p>「餓了能綑住？拿去多當點錢就好了！」</p>
<p>財寶解開了包，忍不住一陣心酸，想起上月第一次米完時，把老婆的前年陪嫁過來的衣服全數寄入了當舖，當時僅留下這件棉襖，可是現在依舊難逃此一刦！</p>
<p>財寶接過了棉襖，驀地心裏好似被刀尖抓住了的，眼淚接着涔涔的滴下。</p>
<p>「快走罷！」財寶嫂鳴咽着說。</p>
<p>財寶用袖口揩了眼淚，悠悠地嘆了口氣，昂着頭就走。外面針刺般的西北風，一陣緊似一陣，對他面上撲來，身上的熱氣，被這麽一吹，就似墮入冰窟般，心禁不住戰了起來。「如何這般無用！」當腦子裏轉了這念頭，就咬緊了牙齒，挺了一挺胸走了。</p>

<h3>談美慾</h3>
<p>— 𠆩仃</p>
<p>愛美是人類的一種天性，在我們經常的生活裏及行爲間，我們就眼見不少這種慾望的表現。例如愛穿漂亮的服裝，愛吃適口的食物，愛往雅緻的房子，愛行淸幽坦潔的路徑，愛看賞心悅目的東西，愛聽有趣味的故事：：：：這些都是美慾的一種表現。</p>
<p>但是，另一方面，有人也說人生是愛醜的，所謂惡慾。他說：因爲我們就眼見不少人類底惡慾的表現，如：愛格殺，愛侵佔，愛損害天然的生靈，愛幹一種利已損人的事。在這人世間，我們就接觸過許多許多那樣的事實。</p>
<p>那麽，人到底是愛美抑或愛醜？不消說人是愛美，因爲愛美是人類的一種天性。而人之所以有惡慾，就因例子的環境惡劣使他那樣，換句話，就因爲他本身是處一個這樣制度底下活動的人。</p>
<p>所以爲了洗滌人間那種醜惡觀念的存在，對抗美慾這回事，我想，有談談的必要。</p>
<p>美慾正如上面說過，是求美的一種慾望，與食慾色慾等等。固然，人類的思維是複雜的，慾望也很多，不單只是美慾。例如利慾，智識慾，道德慾，生存慾，食慾，色慾等等。但美慾却爲人生中最扼要的一種慾欲。缺乏美慾，人類將會變成一種如何醜惡的動物啊！</p>
<p>因此，有人說：「眞美善」是人生三大原素。</p>
<p>那麽『眞』是怎樣呢？求眞是一種智識慾，而求眞的智識慾的對象有科學，因爲科學的起源是用智識來說明的。</p>
<p>『善』又如何？求善是一種道德慾，而求善的道德慾的對象有道德，因爲道德的起源是基於人類的行爲。所以人類經騐過了尺度來衡量現在的行爲。</p>
<p>至『美』呢？求美自然是一種美慾，而求美的美慾的對象有藝術，因爲藝術的起源是從人底本能出發。</p>
<p>故美慾所生的主要的要求是藝術，而藝術乃爲人類最有價値最有意義的一種東西。</p>
<p>故此，我們可以說，求美是推進人生於理想的一種動力。爲了改變人類生活的形式及醜惡的觀念，那麼求美是形成這新生的一種力量。</p>
<h3>戀</h3>
<p>— 村因</p>
<p>湘潭，我的故鄕。</p>
<p>那兒，有我的爸爸，媽媽。也有一個弟弟和妹妹。</p>
<p>在太陽沒有升起的早上。爸爸牽了弟弟還携了一只小皮箱。我挑了行李。媽媽抱着妹妹。</p>
<p>五個人。只有四個人的脚踏在熱烘烘的泥地上走着。</p>
<p>路上，沒有話講。因爲昨夜已講過許多了。</p>
<p>當抵達船埠時，太陽已爬過山頂。把我們的汗都炙出來了。</p>
<p>到了船上。</p>
<p>在航艙裏，從茶房那兒，買了一個舖位。</p>
<p>爸爸，媽媽的眼睛都是淚汪汪的。</p>
<p>「因，到了漢口，再搭到上海的船。那兒，舅舅們都候着你呢！」</p>
<p>爸爸關心的說。</p>
<p>「因兒，路上應該保重些啊！」</p>
<p>弟弟，妹妹都凝望着我。這幾顆熱情的眼珠喲，却使我的淚兒不自主的滴下。</p>
<p>「爸爸，媽媽。你們終得安心一些。孩兒一定：：：」我抽噎起來。</p>
<p>弟弟，暗暗地扯住我的衣襟，說。</p>
<p>「哥哥。你要早一些兒回來啊！」</p>
<p>我從悲哀中抑出一些兒苦笑裝在臉上，向他點了點頭。</p>
<p>「開船囉！」「開船囉！」</p>
<p>這幾聲，正同一支鋼銳的箭。它正射中了我的心。</p>
<p>大家都低着頭說不出話來。</p>
<p>終於我向他們說了一聲：「再見！」還鞠了三個躬。</p>
<p>迅速的，他們走上了躉船。</p>
<p>船慢慢地移動了。</p>
<p>我倚在欄杆上，仔細地注視着四個臉孔。</p>
<p>在他們四個影形將瞧不淸楚的當兒，我抽一塊手帕來向他們揚着。</p>
<p>遠遠地，那邊一個小孩子也在揚起來了。</p>
<p>「他們一定還望着我呢！」</p>
<p>我想着。手愈發搖得起緊。</p>
<p>船，無情的加快了，那邊已變了白茫茫的一片。</p>
<p>如今，這件事已五年了！然而，我還好像在向他們搖着手帕。</p>
<p>湘潭，我的故鄕，這裏有着一個淪落的人兒，在吻你的名字呢！</p>

<p>業餘信箱</p>
<h3>工人的補習敎員</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個出賣勞力在藥廠裏作工的女工。這藥廠本身有許多矛盾，對於工人更用特殊方法壓迫，矛盾是它自己的事我們不必管它，但壓迫却是我們切身的痛苦，因此，我們不得不把它寫出來，向大衆呼援了。</p>
<p>我們出賣了十小時的勞力，但所得的報酬是什麽呢？一天三角錢，此外就是管理員的嘲笑和辱駡了。這是一般工廠所共有的現象，我不必大驚小怪地特別提出來細說，但我們的廠長，却與旁人不同，他異想天開，想出了一個名利雙收的壓迫方法。他辦了一所夜校，讓我們非去讀書不可。旁人聽來，一定以爲這廠長很仁慈，居然肯嘉惠工人給他們補習敎育。其實，狗嘴裏生不出象牙，他那裏有這樣居心。他是因爲藥名很多，所以每天强迫我們上夜課一小時，敎我們記熟Ｘ牌汽水，Ｘ牌Marphinac等等，除此外別的東西一點沒有。這難道可算是補習敎育嗎？尤其是那位奴隸性十足的先生，他得了廠方金錢便狐假虎威，百般欺壓凌辱我們，（年靑的小姑娘好些）在這種淫威之下，我們是祗有到厠所裏去痛哭了。</p>
<p>因爲炎夏已到，我們跑了回家的路程，已是疲乏不堪，此外並要做些個人的雜務：要吃飯，洗浴，洗衣服，有子女的要扶養子女。要再讓我們去讀書，實在是不能從命了。因此，便有許多人不去，有的人便要求在廠外補習。誰知那不顧他人死活的廠方，下了一道聖旨：不上課者開除，在外補習者開除。這夜深是應該上的嗎？天哪，我們的受罪是娘胎裏帶出來的嗎？我們脫離了家庭，出賣了十小時的勞力和血汗還不够我們受用麽？</p>
<p>我因爲路遠（距離有五里多）一直沒有去上夜課，但就此被開除了。有幾位亦同樣地開除了。我們又要受生活的拷打了。請關心民瘼的先生們來援救我們吧！此上敬祝</p>
<p>撰安許曼敬上</p>
<p>編者先生我是女工的朋友，因爲她寫的不大好，所以請我做個代筆。但是錯誤在所不免，請改正了登出來吧。代筆者附記</p>
<p>編者按：把一般將來要靠薪水吃飯的人的本事，提高，使他們的生產能力加大，因而僱用他們勞力的人，較之僱用未受敎育的人更爲有利。在這個社會裏，敎育的目的，本來就是如此如此。許君工廠裏的所謂補習敎育，不過是這種事實的一個極明確的鐵證。許君是失業了，他現在的問題是要另尋職業，寫信的動機大約是氣憤不過，並非要我和他商量對於這種敎育應當採取什麽態度，因此，我也就不說應付廠方的辦法。不過，我覺得該廠工人對於此種學校，却應一致向廠方要求取消，否則，便須把這種學習也當作是工作的一部，也要廠方償付工資。這種要求是很合理的。</p>

<h3>Oriental Travel Agency Officially Established in Yuguan; Some Japanese Personnel Arrive; Railway Bureau Issues Telegram to Staff; Eight Key Points for Traffic Arrangements</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Oriental Travel Agency was officially established in Yuguan today, operating from the old office of the section chief of the station. Some of the Japanese personnel assigned to escort trains have arrived in Yuguan. Yuguan Station has also set up a lodging room for train escort personnel to rest when changing shifts. The procedures for changing shifts between the two sides are quite complicated. The Railway Bureau has published "Traveler's Guidelines" and a "Conductor's Handbook." Both sides are extremely strict on security matters, fearing that other problems may arise after the trains start running. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Beining Railway and the Japanese side have agreed on a general outline of traffic arrangements, with the following eight important points: 1. This train will be prepared by this railway with two trains and by the Guanwai (outside the pass) railway with two trains. Starting from July 1st, one train will run daily in each direction according to the agreed timetable. 2. Locomotives will only reach Shanhaiguan and will not cross over to each other's tracks. The train formation method should follow the promulgated handling procedures. 3. Detailed regulations have been made regarding the handling of traffic procedures, the custody of vehicles, and all accounting and settlement methods. All relevant departments should handle these matters carefully. Any contact should be handled through the Oriental Travel Agency, and no direct relationships should be established. 4. Service personnel on this train will alternate at Shanhaiguan. Matters related to inspectors, electricians, train attendants, and dining car waiters have been stipulated. In addition, train escort police and health inspectors should all change shifts at Shanhaiguan. 5. This train does not accept any free tickets, except for special permits. 6. Telegrams between this railway and the agency will primarily use Chinese, but English may also be used. No other languages will be accepted. Non-official telegrams from the agency will be charged according to regulations and cannot be forwarded outside the pass. Passengers sending telegrams within the pass should follow regulations, but railway telegrams cannot be forwarded outside the pass. 7. The customs inspection of luggage should follow procedures agreed upon by the traffic department, and stations should follow these procedures. The police department should also assist at any time. 8. For this train, in addition to passenger luggage and checked baggage, all insured luggage and packages will not be delivered. (29th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Beining Railway issued another telegram this morning, instructing its employees. (Omitted above) The diplomatic basis for the opening of traffic comes from the Tanggu Truce Agreement. All counties in the war zone and passes along the Great Wall should be released from military occupation, leading to the issue of military aftermath. The Tang-Yu section of the Beining Railway is located within the war zone, and all railway lines, properties, and vehicles have been militarily occupied. If they cannot be recovered simultaneously, the reception of counties in the war zone, the transportation of security teams, and the protection of the railway and suppression of bandits will be impossible to carry out. (Omitted in the middle) Furthermore, the opening of traffic is one of the military aftermath issues, and the nature of the Tanggu Truce Agreement fundamentally does not involve politics. (Omitted in the middle) Therefore, the handling of traffic this time is purely focused on the application of transportation technology. According to the recent principles decided by the League of Nations regarding postal transportation, it does not interfere with the issue of recognition. There is no need for any concerns. In addition, the handling of traffic affairs this time is undertaken by the purely commercial Oriental Travel Agency. Correspondence and contact are handled directly between this bureau and the agency, which fundamentally does not involve diplomatic or political scope, and there is absolutely no room for concern about de facto recognition. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The personnel of the four departments within the Oriental Travel Agency have been announced. Service personnel on the train will be issued badges by the Railway Bureau today, with the five characters "Oriental Travel Agency" embedded on them. New uniforms will be issued. The first train parked at the Fengtai Locomotive Depot will depart for the East Station at 6:00 AM on the 1st. Regarding the issue of inspecting passengers passing through Yuguan, it has been decided that it will be carried out by tax police from both sides. Passengers traveling from Yuguan to Shenyang. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Tong sent Liang Huannai, the secretary-general of the bureau, to Shanghai on the night of the 28th to report to Huang Fu on the announcement of the opening of traffic and to deliver a memorial. When passing through Beijing, it was submitted to the Ministry of Railways. Although Yin Tong repeatedly stated that all preparations had been completed, according to investigations today at the Japanese International Tourist Bureau and the China Travel Service, these two places only received the Beining Railway Bureau's regulations for a special express train. The methods for selling tickets and selling sleeper tickets are not yet known. Many people have come to book sleepers and seats, and they have all been asked to come for contact before the 30th. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The opening of the Ping-Shen (Beiping-Shenyang) traffic is scheduled for the morning of July 1st, with one train running in each direction. The Oriental Travel Agency started operating in Yuguan on the 29th and will be officially established on the 1st. Zhang Shuiqi will serve as the general manager, with the Japanese Hirayama as his deputy. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong stated that the abolition of the Tanggu Truce Agreement is our hope, and the responsible authorities have this intention, but they have not yet officially proposed it to Japan. The provincial authorities fully agree, but it is necessary to listen to the negotiations of the responsible authorities. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Northeast Postal Issue</h3>
<p>(London) It was learned today that the postal transportation through Siberia via "Manchukuo" will soon be restored. This matter will be established through an agreement between the postal authorities of both sides, but it does not involve the main issues of the Chinese government's policy. It is believed that the British government has made friendly non-official recommendations to the Chinese government regarding this issue. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>War Zone Issues; Four Items Awaiting Negotiation</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Representatives from both China and Japan plan to begin overall negotiations on the war zone issues in the near future. Huang will go north in early July to preside over everything. There are four items awaiting negotiation between the two sides: 1. The number of new security teams entering the war zone and the matter of carrying light and heavy firearms. 2. The withdrawal of Japanese troops from the passes along the Great Wall and the handling of the areas in Xinglong and Dushan counties that protrude beyond the Great Wall line. 3. The reception of Malanyu and the withdrawal of puppet police stationed along the Great Wall line. 4. The right to custody of the Eastern Tombs. Yin Rugeng went to Tianjin to contact Yu, and after consultation, he will return to Beiping to contact Chaisan. The puppet police who withdrew from Nantianmen earlier have been withdrawn by the National Highway Bureau outside the Great Wall line. The headquarters of the puppet police team in Gubeikou has not yet withdrawn. In the counties of the Pingbei war zone, such as Shunyi and Miyun, Japanese technicians have recently been going to the county governments and public security bureaus to investigate local business conditions and resident populations, and some are surveying maps. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng previously went to Tianjin with Yin Tixin to continue discussing various issues in the war zone with the Japanese side. Yin Tong was unable to come to Beiping due to participating in the discussion of this issue. It is said that the Japanese side is still insisting on its original proposal regarding the rotation of new and old security teams in the war zone. Our side believes that in order to maintain the safety of the railway after the opening of the Ping-Shen traffic, the security teams must enter the war zone as soon as possible to maintain治安 (zhì'ān, public order). Yin Rugeng's return to Beiping is yet to be determined. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) Chiang, in order to govern disorder with severe measures and special crimes, has repeatedly issued laws. Still fearing that the procedures are cumbersome and the process is slow, those who are guilty are detained for a long time before being executed, and those who are innocent are trapped in prison. Those who should be executed immediately are allowed to request instructions at any time by telegram. He gave three points to the commissioners: 1. The regulations for punishing local bullies issued by the headquarters are also applicable to Fujian, Henan, Hubei, and Anhui bandit suppression areas in addition to Jiangxi. 2. In bandit cases, the commissioners and county magistrates in the bandit areas, who also serve as military judges, have the right to investigate and handle cases. Cases in non-bandit areas should be submitted to the provincial government for approval. 3. Drug cases should be handled in accordance with the current regulations strictly prohibiting drugs in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Gansu, and Shaanxi.

<h3>New Customs Import Tariff Completed for Promulgation; Import Tariff on Cotton Yarn Reduced</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The new customs import tariff has been approved by the central government. The Legislative Yuan did not discuss it on the 29th. The Ministry of Finance has completed the preparations for promulgation and will be promulgated by the Shanghai General Customs Administration on schedule and will be implemented on July 1st. As for the content of the newly revised tariff, in order to take into account international trade, all those without domestic substitutes have been appropriately reduced. Raw materials have also been reduced in many cases. There are discrepancies between the types with increased tariffs and the types with reduced tariffs. There are about 20 types that are lower than the old import tariff. Among them, cotton yarn, which is quite important in the market, has been stipulated to be reduced by 5%. Although the domestic cotton yarn industry has been facing difficulties in recent years, the needs of the Chinese people and the amount of production have become a problem. The initial intention of the Legislative Yuan was to change it to a reduction of 2%. After further consideration by the central government, it was decided to maintain the reduction of 5%. In addition, sugar and paper have also been reduced. As for the increases, they are mostly luxury goods and consumables, etc., and there are no drastic changes among those with domestic production. These new tariffs will also be implemented at the passes of the Great Wall in North China on July 1st. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Express Goodwill Regarding China's Reform of Customs Duties</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) China plans to implement a partial reduction of tariff rates. Although the details are not yet clear, since the increase in tariffs in May last year, tax revenues have increased, and the voices against tax cuts have been strong from the Ministry of Industry and other parties for the protection of domestic industries. Therefore, Japanese merchants engaged in this business had very little expectation for China to reduce tariffs in reality. However, now there is news of this revision, so these merchants are expressing goodwill. (29th Japanese News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Adhering to Frugality</h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>The Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang passed a motion to vigorously implement the frugality movement. It was decided that the government and the people should work together. Unfortunately, implementation is difficult and the effect is minimal. But we support the frugality movement and will not be discouraged by this. We still advocate saving those materials that are not necessary for daily life and using them as a backup for resisting aggression and saving the country. This is what the authorities and citizens of major countries in the world are working together on. When it comes to the severity of China's national crisis, the exhaustion of its finances, and the poverty of its people's livelihoods, it is probably impossible to find a second country in the world. Logically, we should work harder on frugality in order to accumulate human and material resources to revitalize the country and reverse the current misfortune of the nation. This is a matter of course and falls under the responsibility of citizens, and there is no room for evasion. However, we know that the Chinese people are the most diligent and frugal people in the world, especially the farmers who are engaged in farming. They work hard all year round, putting out the greatest labor and exchanging it for the lowest enjoyment. Their purpose is only to seek a little warmth and food, so they have long been frugal to the point where they cannot be more frugal. Today, we support and advocate frugality, and undoubtedly this is directed at people in large cities and small and medium-sized cities.</p>
<p>China's current poverty is not the responsibility of the rural areas themselves. Because they have already fulfilled their due obligations to the government and the general society. But cities are not the same. Many people among them have not only separated from the group of producers and become pure consumers, but they also often harm the common people and hinder the progress of production. The fact that cities consume material resources and destroy human resources more than rural areas by ten or a hundred times is obvious and can be seen by all. However, since the rural areas have already been exhausted, the impact on the cities must also be very serious. In other words, the urban economy will inevitably gradually move towards bankruptcy due to panic. If there are no effective ways to save it, it may cause the entire national economy to fall into a state of destruction. Although the frugality movement is only one of the ways to save the crisis, if it can be implemented properly, it can also provide considerable assistance.</p>
<p>Now we must ask, from which direction should the frugality movement begin? We believe that it must first start with the political and social leaders themselves. They must make politics clean and honest, and at the same time, they must lead by example and establish a model of a clean and honest government. Those responsible at the central level should set an example for the whole country. Local authorities in each province, and even the county magistrates who are close to the people, should also practice frugality in their respective scopes. If they can truly work for the country and the people, their own enjoyment will not exceed the limits of essential living. After these two points are achieved, they can further use the demeanor they have shown to influence the upper echelons of society. If the upper echelons of society are influenced by them and create a good atmosphere, the result will also affect politics, so that the stains on politics will gradually be washed away. In short, the frugality movement should start from the upper levels, because whether in China or abroad, whether female or male, the people who waste the most and are the most extravagant are always close to the upper class. Therefore, if political leaders and social leaders can truly practice frugality, then more people will follow them. In fact, it is naturally easier to see results.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we are reminded of the young students of today, because they have a greater possibility of becoming future leaders than ordinary people. Therefore, their behavior is also more closely related to the future of the country and society. There are indeed many young students in the mainland who are able to be frugal and diligent, and who know how to develop the characteristics of an agricultural nation. But there are also quite a few students in cities, especially those above the high school level, who forget their own responsibilities and are immersed in extravagant habits. This is what leaders responsible for political, educational, and social reform should pay special attention to. In short, the frugality movement does not necessarily require it to be universal in all strata of society, but it requires it to achieve the greatest practical effect. Then the mission that the upper class and students should fulfill is particularly great. The reason for this is either because their lives are relatively affluent and they are prone to extravagance, or because their status makes it easy for ordinary people to follow and imitate. The relationship between going out and coming in is extremely great. Whether the frugality movement will repeat the mistakes of the past depends on whether these two groups of people can realize their own mistakes and take action.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Yuan Impeaches Gu Mengyu for Illegal Acts and Corruption in the Purchase of Materials for the Datong Road, Should Be Transferred to Disciplinary Action</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Supervisory Committee member Liu Houwu impeached Railway Minister Gu Mengyu for losing national sovereignty, violating national laws, harming national interests, dereliction of duty, and private gain. After the Yuan legally handed it over to committee members Yang Tianji and others for review, it was found that there was no evidence of the alleged loss of sovereignty. However, after reviewing the entire contents of the contract and the procedures for its signing, the minister did engage in illegal acts and corruption, and should be transferred to disciplinary action. The Yuan has prepared the relevant documents and submitted them to the National Government for review and implementation. The original impeachment case and review report, as well as the document submitted to the National Government, were officially announced by the Supervisory Yuan today. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Supervisory Yuan's Document to the National Government</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Supervisory Yuan's document to the National Government stated: "Regarding the submission of the case, according to the impeachment of Railway Minister Gu Mengyu by Supervisory Committee member Liu Houwu for losing national sovereignty, violating national laws, harming national interests, dereliction of duty, and private gain, the case was legally handed over to Supervisory Committee members Yang Tianji, Li Zhengle, and Liu Eqing for review. Now, according to the report, the members reviewed the original impeachment case and found no factual basis for the alleged loss of sovereignty. However, after reviewing the entire contents of the contract and the procedures for its signing, the Railway Minister Gu Mengyu did engage in illegal acts and corruption, and should be transferred to disciplinary action. Based on this, we have prepared the relevant documents and submitted them to your government for review and implementation. Respectfully presented to the Chairman of the National Government, Lin; President of the Supervisory Yuan, Yu Youren."</p>
<h3>Review Report</h3>
<p>Furthermore, the original review report is as follows. Prior to the review report, it was submitted by the President of the Yuan (院). The case of impeachment against Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, by Committee Members Liu and Hou Wu, for relinquishing rights and violating the law, in the matter of the Da-Tong Railway material purchase contract. Upon further review, it was unanimously agreed that the content of the Da-Tong Railway material purchase contract signed by the Ministry of Railways required urgent study. It was requested that the Yuan prepare a document to secretly request the original contract from the ministry for detailed review. Subsequently, Tian Ji, upon instruction, went to the ministry and obtained the contract. After review by the committee members, all opinions are listed as follows: (1) The original impeachment stated that the Ministry of Railways continued to conduct a material loan with Mr. Mardin, the French representative of the Zhengtai Railway, totaling 90 million francs, for the purpose of repairing and extending the Da-Tong Railway. After investigation, the original contract was signed between the Ministry of Railways and the Paris Industrial and Electrical Plant for the purchase of railway materials, with twelve articles. The total price of the materials was 50 million French francs, and the delivery date was sixteen months. Payment for the materials was divided into eleven installments, two installments per year, to be fully paid by January of the 28th year of the Republic. As for the guarantee method, the income of the Zhengtai Railway was designated for payment, and indirectly guaranteed by a consortium of five banks, namely, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Zhongnan Bank, the Jincheng Bank, and the Yanyeh Bank. In addition, the Ministry of Railways signed an engineering advance payment contract and a guaranteed promissory note contract with the banking group, stipulating the date of the bank group's advance payment and the bank group's dispatch of personnel to audit the Zhengtai Railway's income and expenditure, etc. Subsequently, inquiries to the Materials Purchasing Committee of the Ministry claimed that the purchased materials were specifically for the purpose of facilitating the Tongxi section of the Longhai Railway to meet urgent needs, and that the previous plan to build the Da-Tong Railway had been abandoned. Therefore, this contract does not belong to the Da-Tong Railway, and the guarantee part is also indirectly guaranteed by the Chinese banking group, and bank representatives are sent to audit the railway funds. It is also not the creditor's unilateral supervision. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the original impeachment case's claim of relinquishing rights and harming the country.</p>
<p>(2) The original impeachment stated that the amount of this material loan reached 90 million francs. After investigation, the total price of the original contract materials was 50 million French francs. Although it does not match the amount in the impeachment case, after reviewing the entire content of the contract and its signing procedures, the Minister of Railways, Gu Mengyu, did indeed engage in illegal and fraudulent activities. (A) The contract is nominally for material terms, but the type and name of the material are never mentioned. Even the delivery date only states that it will be completed in sixteen months, and it does not specify the amount of each delivery. Conversely, the payment for the materials is listed annually, and an advance promissory note contract is signed with the Chinese banking group as an attachment. Therefore, the content is purely in the form of a loan contract. The minister used the name of purchasing materials as a disguised loan, hoping to deceive the people of the country and avoid the review procedures of the Legislative Yuan, and secretly signed it. This is the first instance of illegal and fraudulent activities. (B) The contract was signed on March 6th of the 22nd year of the Republic, and the two attached contracts with the banking group were signed on July 1st of the same year. It was only after the Yuan had filed an impeachment on May 7th of this year and retrieved the original contract that it was reported to the Executive Yuan meeting (see the minutes of the 159th meeting of the Executive Yuan). This is the second instance of illegal and fraudulent activities because it was not reported to the Executive Yuan for approval beforehand, which does not comply with administrative legal procedures. (C) According to the Provisional Regulations for Material Purchase of the Ministry of Railways, all material purchases above 5,000 yuan must be put out to tender to prevent favoritism and fraud. The total amount of material purchase in the original contract was 50 million francs, equivalent to more than 10 million yuan in national currency. Why was the contract not signed secretly with the so-called Paris Industrial and Electrical Plant without going through open bidding procedures? This is the third instance of illegal and fraudulent activities. Based on the above points, the impeached person, Minister of Railways, Gu Mengyu, should be transferred to the Disciplinary Committee in accordance with the law to warn against private interests and maintain the rule of law. Respectfully submitted to the President of the Yuan. Yang Tianji, Li Zhengle, Liu Eqing.</p>
<h3>Original Text of the Impeachment Case</h3>
<p>Furthermore, Supervisory Committee Members Liu and Hou Wu submitted a document to the President of the Yuan stating: "Submitting a proposal for impeachment. The procedures for the country to borrow foreign funds are very detailed, and the government's planning for railway construction should be especially cautious. The Ministry of Railways, as the highest administrative authority in charge of national roads, should respect national sovereignty when utilizing foreign capital, avoid being bound by harsh conditions, and comply with national laws. It should submit proposals to the Central Political Conference for approval and then to the Legislative Yuan for review before implementation. Route construction should develop the future interests of the country and the people with the most economical policies, eliminating all the old corruption of inflated costs and embezzlement. The responsibility is self-evident. However, the current Minister of Railways, Gu Mengyu, has made a serious mistake in handling the material loan for the Da-Tong Railway. An investigation reveals four aspects of his actions that relinquish rights, violate the law, harm the country, and serve private interests, which are listed as follows:"</p>
<p>"(1) The Zhengtai Railway originally borrowed 40 million French francs, with a term of 30 years, and the principal and interest were paid back on schedule. As of March 1st of the 21st year of the Republic, the debt had been fully repaid. According to the contract, the contract should have been terminated and the railway taken back for independent operation. However, Gu Mengyu delayed the takeover and secretly continued a material loan with Mr. Mardin, the French representative (i.e., the French side purchases materials on behalf and settles accounts as cash, which is repaid in installments every six months for ten installments). After Mr. Mardin returned to France, he signed a material loan agreement with a Paris electrical manufacturer for a total of 90 million French francs for the expansion and repair of the Da-Tong Railway, divided into three batches: 50 million French francs in the first batch, 25 million French francs in the second batch, and 15 million French francs in the third batch. A separate contract was signed for each batch. On July 1st of the 22nd year of the Republic, Gu Mengyu sent representatives to sign the agreement with the representatives of the Paris electrical manufacturer, causing the formal takeover of the Zhengtai Railway to be delayed by as much as one year. Fearing criticism from foreigners, the material loan contract was falsely called a material purchase contract (it is said that several batches of the materials have arrived and are being used for the Tongxi section of the Longhai Railway and the Da-Tong Railway). This material loan is secured by the income of the newly taken-over Zhengtai Railway, and also guaranteed by the Bank of China and other Chinese bank groups. In addition, Mr. Vinot, a French national, continues to serve as the head of the Traffic Department of the Zhengtai Railway, and Mr. Boyan, a French national, is appointed as the chief auditor of the Zhengtai Railway and the chief engineer of the Da-Tong Railway. Due to debt relations, the China Communications and other bank groups have also dispatched Wang Yizeng, the president of the Shijiazhuang Bank of Communications, as a resident supervisor. It appears that the Zhengtai Railway is taken over in name only, and the major power is still controlled by French nationals. All income is used as an unlimited guarantee, and the conditions are particularly harsh. This is the minister's disregard for the interests of the country in borrowing foreign funds and the loss of national sovereignty, for which he should be punished."</p>
<p>"(2) The amount of this material loan reaches 90 million French francs. Since it is nominally for the expansion and repair of the Da-Tong Railway, and it is known that the uneconomical construction funds and the harsh conditions that damage national sovereignty cannot obtain the consent of the Central Political Conference and the legislative bodies. Therefore, on the surface, it is called a material purchase loan, divided into batches and contracted for small amounts, hoping to deceive the people of the country and avoid the legal procedures of submitting a request to the Central Political Conference for approval and submitting it to the Legislative Yuan for review in accordance with the law. This is the minister's violation of national law and his skillful evasion of the exercise of the powers of the Central Political Conference and the legislative bodies, for which he should be punished."</p>
<p>"(3) The so-called Da-Tong line has been under construction for almost a year. Only 35 kilometers of the original earthwork have been repaired from Yuci along the old Tongcheng line to Taigu, and only five or six miles of track have been laid (the track gauge is four feet eight and a half inches, which is narrower than the Zhengtai Railway's gauge of one meter). The Tongpu Railway built by the Shanxi arsenal also starts from Taiyuan, passing through Lunci Taigu to Jiexiu. The Zhengtai Railway between Taiyuan and Yuci and the Da-Tong Railway between Yuci and Taigu face each other from a distance, both becoming parallel lines at the closest distance. At a time when the state-owned railway is in urgent need of expansion, there are more important domestic transportation routes that need to be built than this one. The minister borrowed a huge amount of foreign capital, but only for the construction of this parallel route, giving priority to what is slow and neglecting what is important. His understanding of the overall situation is poor, and his measures are misguided. Moreover, during the current construction period, he is wasting time and wasting salaries. Even if the route is fortunately completed in the future, it will lead to business competition due to the two parallel routes, and the result will inevitably lead to two failures. This is the minister's improper measures and deliberate damage to the country's interests, for which he should be punished."</p>
<p>"(4) Article 136 of the Criminal Law on dereliction of duty states that a public official who directly or indirectly seeks personal gain from matters under his jurisdiction or supervision shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to three years and may also be fined up to three thousand yuan. Now, the minister has secretly carried out this huge material loan without going through legal procedures. He has fabricated names and falsely called it a material purchase contract. He has even disregarded the ordinary procedures for government agencies to openly bid for the purchase of goods. May I ask, can the eyes and ears of the 400 million people be completely covered up by the purchase of 90 million francs of materials, which is a huge sum of money? Some say that there are many shady deals in this material purchase, and the ingenuity of its profiteering and the amount of embezzlement are even greater than the loan rebates during the era of the Beijing government. People are talking about it, and it is not without reason. At a time when the world economy is depressed and the supply of goods from various countries exceeds demand, and the devaluation and competitive sale of goods has become a common phenomenon, there is no standard for the quality, price, and value of the materials purchased by the French side. The contract was secretly signed beforehand, and it was kept secret. Afterwards, there was no formal open bidding. Who would believe that he was not seeking personal gain? This is the minister's dereliction of duty and pursuit of personal gain, for which he should be punished."</p>
<p>"In summary, the above-mentioned points clearly show that the Minister of Railways, Gu Mengyu, has relinquished national sovereignty, violated national laws, damaged national interests, and committed dereliction of duty and pursuit of personal gain. He should be severely punished. Now, in accordance with the law, I hereby propose an impeachment and respectfully request that it be transferred to the Disciplinary Committee to uphold national law and warn against official corruption, which is in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the President of the Yuan. (Including one drawing) Supervisory Committee Member Liu Houwu. (29th Daily Telegram)"</p>

<h3>President Roosevelt Declares a New Beginning with the People, Implementing Three Major Tasks for the Benefit of the People, Denies Communism or Fascism, and the Achievements of the Recovery Have Not Damaged Constitutional Rights</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt gave a radio address to the nation tonight, saying that the government's greatest goal is to restore basic fairness and justice, and strongly denied any communist or fascist tendencies. The President also described his achievements, saying that the government's most important goals in the future are three: (1) Economic security for every American citizen, (2) Developing America's land and water resources, (3) Social insurance. The President did not elaborate on how the government will achieve these goals, but said that he will be able to provide a detailed explanation to the people of the country in the future. Roosevelt praised Congress's achievements and recognized the elimination of partisan prejudices as the greatest success because it was able to discuss everything in an impartial and non-partisan spirit. The President then briefly described the proceedings of the last Congress and paid special attention to Mr. Vincent's most advantageous naval bill and the newly established monetary system. Roosevelt said, "The most important success of Congress is the establishment of policies suitable for modern life, making the American monetary system more equitable, and making gold and silver both the basis of the American monetary system." The President then compared his policies with those of previous presidents in the past ten years, believing that they were all too short-sighted. Therefore, when he took office in March 1933, he implemented the following three plans: (1) Relief for unemployment and poverty, (2) Economic recovery, (3) Improving the adverse conditions caused by the economic decline and restoring basic justice and fairness. Since the implementation of this plan, the number of unemployed has been greatly reduced, rural income has increased sharply, and all businesses have gradually returned to normal. As for the critics who said that his policies are not in line with the traditional American norms, Roosevelt retorted, saying, "I ask, who has lost their rights and freedoms within the scope of the Constitution?" The President believes that those who generally believe that they have been harmed by the New Deal are all those who demand special political and financial rights. They are all complaining because they cannot harm others for their own benefit by means of ingenuity. The President said that the ruling power of the people has gradually restored confidence in the country, so there is no need to overthink that the New Deal has communist and fascist tendencies. Finally, Roosevelt briefly described his plan to tour Honolulu, which will be held with Haiti Colombia and Panama president meeting said. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Luo broadcast an address to the nation today for the first time since last October, summarizing the achievements of the authorities' recovery movement. He said: "Today, there are four things, and I ask the people to answer: (1) Is your current life better than last year? (2) Are your debt burdens lighter than before? (3) Are your bank deposits safer than before? (4) Has your work situation improved compared to before? What are your answers? There is no doubt that the three steps the government is currently taking to protect the national life are relief, recovery, and aftercare. These steps are necessary for three reasons: One is the depression caused by the Chinese people's狂妄 pursuit of unearned wealth in the past ten years, two is that many of today's difficulties are caused by the business and financial leaders' ignorance of the basic principles of fairness and justice, and three are the new conditions in the economic life." President Luo then mentioned the increase in wages, the reduction in unemployment, the increase in the value of agricultural products, and the exemption of thousands of families from displacement, pointing to this as clear evidence of the success of his policies, and said that the government has achieved this result without harming the rights of freedom under the Constitution. Although some people feel inconvenienced, they are only a minority in comparison. In the future, the government will devote itself to better housing, the use of land and water resources, and the establishment of social insurance in the people's livelihood security program. President Luo also mentioned industrial autonomy, saying that the purpose of our construction is to protect industries from fighting each other, and to protect consumers and maintain appropriate competition to avoid the crazy rise of retail prices. A few cowards who are worried about progress often want to 䨓 with strange terms such as fascism, communism or socialism etc., in fact, what we do is very simple, and in line with implementation, it is just that the average coward wants to make it complicated. We are now implementing the ideals inherent in the United States that have been tried and tested. Other countries may sacrifice democracy and want to seek transitional excitement in corrupt and discredited dictatorships, but we want to restore the credibility and welfare of democracy. President Luo finally mentioned the work of Congress, the most important event that Congress has already passed, for the change of the monetary system, the establishment of new life standards, and the treatment of gold and silver fairly, considering them as the base of American currency.

<h3>The U.S. Treasury Department Announces a Ban on Silver Exports to Prevent Speculators from Profiteering, and Severe Penalties for Those Who Violate It</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the U.S. government suddenly announced a ban on silver exports. Experts here believe that this is aimed at silver speculators. After the ban is issued, speculators will not be able to ship silver out of the United States and buy it back from the United States in foreign markets, thus circumventing the 50% profit tax. This ban was issued by Treasury Secretary Morganthau and is roughly the same as last year's ban on gold exports. However, exported silver that was traded before the ban was issued can still be shipped out with a license. In addition, manufactured goods made of silver are not subject to the ban. To obtain an export license, the following evidence must be submitted to the Treasury Department: (1) The silver to be shipped is to fulfill a contract signed before the ban was issued; (2) The silver has been owned by a foreign government, foreign bank, or international clearing bank recognized by the United States before the ban was issued; (3) It is a transit cargo or delivered to a metallurgical plant for refining; (4) Alloy silver with less than 80% purity; (5) Permitted by the President and not in conflict with the Silver Law of 1934. Those who violate it will be fined up to 10,000 yuan or imprisoned for up to ten years. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) New York recently sold US dollars in anticipation that President Luo's speech would contain a preview of currency inflation. However, President Luo's speech has now been delivered, and this hope has become a bubble. Therefore, the sale of US dollars may stop. Former French Finance Minister Renault's remarks in the House of Representatives, pointing out the difficulties currently encountered by French industries and the difference between French prices and world prices, as well as the recent disturbances in various provinces of France, are now causing concerns about the future of the franc. Parisian funds are now gradually flowing into London, and this trend is promoted by the British government's control of the exchange market. However, London Financial News does not approve of this move by the British government, saying that the British Exchange Equalization Fund is gradually running out of money and a lot of gold has been consumed. It should now allow the franc to rise and fall on its own in order to preserve the equalization fund for future protection of the pound. However, other parties currently believe that the current price of Continental gold coins converted into pounds is too high. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) National Bank officials announced today that bank deposits have increased by approximately US$10 billion since February. The increase in deposits in mid-April has never exceeded this number. Moreover, this increase does not include the government's sharply increased deposits, nor does it include the deposits of other banks. Therefore, this increase is sufficient to represent the savings of individuals and companies. Officials here unanimously expressed optimism about the sharp increase in bank deposits. They not only regard this as a restoration of the American people's belief in banks, but also regard this as a sign of progress in recovery work. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>British Economist</p>
<h3>On China and Silver Prices</h3>
<p>(London) A memorandum from Manchester today contains an article by the renowned economist Sir Charles, roughly stating that it is regrettable that China's power has not been used effectively. What China needs is the stability of silver prices, not artificial increases. China's interests should allow it to have a dominant influence in silver policy. China was uniquely able to avoid the world economic misfortunes of 1930 and 1931 because of the low silver prices. Since Japan and the United States abandoned the gold standard, silver prices have risen sharply, and the situation has changed. China's exports have greatly decreased, leading to a serious trade deficit and the need for capital outflow. Due to internal unrest, silver is now concentrated in Shanghai, which exacerbates the difficulties, while the interior lacks currency and prices are falling. China must restore its original internal situation so that foreign capital can flow back into China. (28th Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Revision of Silk Tariffs: Major Impact on Our Country's Exports</h3>
<p>(London) The British Treasury issued an order today, announcing revised tariffs on natural silk, rayon, and goods made entirely or partially from natural silk or rayon, effective July 2nd. Eastern silks, such as those produced in Shandong, Ninghai, Nanshan, Henan, Andong, and Khabartai, will be taxed at three shillings and sixpence for dyed and printed varieties, and two shillings and ninepence for undyed and unprinted varieties. Furthermore, the above-mentioned Eastern silks, if dyed or printed, will also be subject to a tax of 25% of the value of the goods, or an additional seven and a half pence per square yard. In addition, the tax rate for goods made entirely or partially from natural silk or rayon will remain unchanged unless the natural silk or rayon content exceeds 5% of the value of the goods, but if the value does not exceed 20% of the total value of the various components of the goods, the tax rate will increase by 20% to 25%. (28th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Today, a Reuters reporter visited personnel from the Silk Association to inquire about the impact of the new Anglo-French commercial treaty. The response was that they had not yet fully studied the document, but they believed that it would have a significant impact on Chinese silk. Any benefits gained from the low tax rate on dyed and printed silks would be entirely offset by the increased tax rate on unprinted and undyed silks. The number of printed and dyed silks imported by Britain from China is very small. The Silk Association is quite impatient with the government's delay in resolving this issue and will hold an important meeting next week. Currently, there are no apparent negotiations between Britain and Japan on this matter. (29th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Contents of the Anglo-French Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>(London) The Anglo-French commercial treaty signed yesterday stipulates that the two countries will grant each other most-favored-nation status. France will restore the original quotas for British goods, Britain will abolish the 20% duty on French goods, France will maintain the current percentage of British coal imports, and Britain will also revise import duties on silk, reducing the current tax rate on raw silk by half and re-examining the tax rate on silk goods to slightly increase the import tax on silk goods. It is estimated that this revision will reduce the British treasury's revenue by three million pounds per year. The Anglo-French commercial treaty is valid until April 1, 1935. During the validity of this treaty, Britain will not increase import duties on French brandy and other alcoholic beverages. After the treaty expires, taxes may be increased, but three months' notice must be given in advance. (28th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Stalemate in U.S.-Russian Debt Talks</h3>
<p>(Washington) Negotiations in Moscow on the repayment of Russian debts to the United States have reached a stalemate. It is expected that the U.S.-Russian negotiations will be transferred to Washington for handling.

It is rumored that progress has been made on the principal amount to be repaid, but serious disputes have arisen over the interest rate and payment method. (29th Reuters)</p>

<h3>U.S. Note to Germany: Dissatisfaction with Explanation of Debt Suspension; Says Germany's Inability to Pay Debts is Self-Inflicted</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull today sent a very blunt note to the German government, calling its recent explanation for the suspension of war debt payments "highly inappropriate." The note stated that Germany's explanation was simply an attempt to hold creditor nations responsible for the debtor nation's inability to fulfill its obligations due to poor business conditions. As for Germany's difficulties, the United States believes that political factors are largely responsible, which has hindered trade, and foreign capital in Germany is gradually being withdrawn. Moreover, foreigners are aware that Germany is using commercial surpluses to buy back its own bonds in foreign markets at low prices and to purchase military equipment, while neglecting its debt obligations. If Germany wanted to fulfill its debt obligations, it could simply attribute it to poor business performance. Although the United States does not wish to express an opinion on the impact of the suspension of payments on the Dawes and Young plans because it is not a signatory country, it opposes any discriminatory treatment of U.S. bondholders.

<p>Chicago According to reports from Chicago, it is extremely hot everywhere today. 110 people have died from the heat in the Midwest. It has not rained in the Midwest for several weeks, and a drought has been established. Now, a heatwave is wreaking havoc, truly a double whammy.

The affected area has expanded today from Ohio to Kansas and from the Canadian border to the Mexican border, covering most of 18 states. There is still no hope of the heatwave subsiding. The meteorologist in charge announced on the radio tonight that this high heat will continue for at least two more days, so the current heatwave may exceed that of 1930.

<h3>Mutual Understanding of Naval Positions: Anglo-American Negotiations Temporarily Suspended; French Representative to Arrive in London Soon to Participate in Preliminary Naval Talks</h3>
<p>(London) It was learned today from the American side in London that the preliminary naval talks between Britain and the United States have ended. It is unlikely that further discussions will be held before the representatives of France, Italy, and Japan arrive in London. U.S. Representative Davis met today with French Ambassador to Britain Corbin to prepare for naval talks between France and the United States. Britain and the United States have not agreed to continue the talks, and the U.S. representative is now preparing to discuss naval issues with other countries. Therefore, it is believed that the naval talks between Britain and the United States have ended. However, this is a temporary suspension and should not be seen as obstructed, as both sides have thoroughly explained their positions. Therefore, it is not necessary to continue the talks before exchanging opinions with the representatives of Italy, France, and Japan. (28th Reuters)</p>

<h3>French Defense Budget Approved in Full by the Senate: Expanding the Air Force Considered Essential</h3>
<p>(Paris) The defense budget, after being passed by the Chamber of Deputies on the 14th of this month, was transferred to the Senate. On the 19th, the Senate again passed the general organization law of the Air Force by a show of hands. Today, the Senate convened a meeting and passed the defense budget, which had been passed by the Chamber of Deputies, by a large majority of 276 votes to 11. Army Minister General Petain said that priority should be given to passive defense. Defensive engineering and armaments that have been hastily set up and are incomplete must be improved, but this will be costly. Air Force Minister General Denain expressed his opinion, saying that the reason why France has the ability to equip itself with aviation but has not done so is because the Air Force was only used as an auxiliary to the Army and Navy in the past and was not regarded as an independent force. General Denain also said that when necessary, foreign inventions may have to be purchased to supplement the inadequacy of domestic aircraft manufacturing. (28th Havas)</p>

As a result, the meeting abandoned its resolute opposition to any war and decided on a declaration stating that a distinction must be made between wars of aggression and wars to safeguard peace.

The main purpose of the draft is to classify the violation and sanction methods to ensure that they are rigid, while the wording of the classification content may be slightly flexible. Any violation, depending on the severity of the circumstances, will be certified by the regional committee once discovered by the League of Nations or the Permanent Disarmament Commission. The nature of the violation is extremely serious and constitutes a danger of aggression, which is a political issue and should be intervened by the League of Nations together with the governments of the countries concerned.

<h3>Anti-German Propaganda in Paris: Deliberately Creating an Atmosphere of Terror; Concealing Its Own Expansion of Armaments</h3>
<p>(Berlin) A recent article in a Paris magazine made an alarming prophecy that German planes would launch a large-scale attack on Paris in mid-July. The so-called "Amazing Discoverer One" of Wieghardt-Städtter also disclosed a prophecy in a London newspaper that Germany would destroy major European cities with chemical and bacteriological warfare in the future. Currently, the semi-official German organization Diplomatic Political Commentary has expressed its opinion on this kind of unfounded talk, believing that it is completely groundless and that the manufacture of such terrifying propaganda is even worse than during wartime. It is unexpected that such ominous words would be uttered in the current period of peace to frighten the world. The newspaper also pointed out that the revival of this kind of anti-German propaganda is clearly intended to create an atmosphere of terror in France and to make the French people feel the need to expand their armaments. However, it must be known that the manufacturers of these rumors have unlimited responsibility, because they have brewed various unfortunate events and disputes in the manufacture of panic and hatred, and have opened up a dark future. Therefore, it is hoped that they can realize their mistakes as soon as possible, otherwise it will be too late. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>As Barthou Passes Through, Austria Sees New Terrorist Acts: Bombs Destroy Railroad Tracks at Night; Water Pipes Burst, Almost Creating a Swamp</h3>
<p>The outbreak of the second bombing wave in Vienna reached its peak in Upper Austria this morning, and the Dollfuss cabinet, threatened by this, had to convene an emergency meeting this afternoon. Among the various bombing incidents, the most alarming was the destruction of three sections of the scenic railway between Innsbruck and Kapl. The railroad tracks near Bludenz were blasted into the air. French Foreign Minister Barthou had just passed through there an hour before on his way back to Paris from Belgrade. Other important railways that were destroyed were one in Styria and one in the suburbs of Lower Austria's Salzburg. The perpetrators of the above bombing incidents were well-planned and completely successful. Telephones and electrical wires in the surrounding areas were also cut in advance or after the fact. Furthermore, the most shocking of the bombing incidents last night was the explosion of a high-pressure water pipe in Constanz. The water pipe was buried on the mountain, so the villages below the mountain were awakened in the middle of the night. At the same time, large amounts of iron and stone flew around and fell on the houses in the village. After the water pipe burst, floods broke out, turning the cliffs into swamps. In Innsbruck, a night watchman at a newspaper office found a suspicious-looking package on the roof. He picked it up and threw it into the garden of a nearby hotel, but the object exploded immediately, destroying the entire hotel and shattering the windows of the newspaper building.

<h3>Prelude to the British Embassy Moving South</h3>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Discusses Inspection Tour</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Xueliang met with reporters at the headquarters on the 28th. According to his account, he inspected six counties on the border of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, met with various generals and the public, and discussed everything with Liu Zhenhua. He planned to go to Runan again but was stopped due to circumstances. The remaining bandits in the border area have reorganized into smaller units and entrenched themselves between Jingfu and Lishan, with only 3,000 to 4,000 people and guns. They are heavily besieged, and many coerced bandits are awakening and surrendering. The principle of both suppression and pacification is still being followed, and they are being treated with leniency. As long as the army continues to work hard, they can be eliminated. The local customs in each county are honest and simple, but local bullies are rampant, taxes are heavy, and the people are extremely poor. Although the government is working hard to seek rehabilitation, it lacks people with governing skills, in addition to methods of governance. Coupled with rural bankruptcy, thousands of miles are in ruins, with a lack of houses and cattle. Whether credit loans can be popularized is also a problem. To talk about bandit suppression and rehabilitation, one must first alleviate the suffering of the people, otherwise the crisis remains. It is not just the Red bandits who are waiting for resources to rise. The Central China Economic Discussion Society has been established for a long time and is investigating production and sales, and researching improvements for rural revitalization. Zhang concluded by saying that he has made many political statements since returning to China. After a brief respite, he will go to the front to inspect, but the date and location have not yet been determined. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Announcement of the Beiping-Shenyang Through Train Plan - Beiping-Liaoning Railway Assigns Personnel to Serve the Through Train - The Oriental Travel Agency Decides to Operate in Three Departments</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The resumption of the Beiping-Shenyang through train service was announced simultaneously by both Chinese and Japanese sides today (the 28th) in the morning. On the Beiping side, the Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau specially dispatched Wu Songhua, a member of the Bureau's Improvement Committee and former Deputy Director of the General Affairs Department, carrying the announcement documents. He arrived in Beiping from Tianjin on the Beiping-Liaoning Railway's 10th train at 11:20 PM last night. At 8:00 AM this morning, the announcement was made at the Bureau's Beiping Office at Qianmen Station. However, what was announced was not the so-called "Through Train Plan," but only a "Notice on the Resumption of Through Passenger Train Service between Beiping and Shenyang" and "Special Express Train Passenger Instructions" issued in the name of Director Yin Tong. On the Japanese side, Military Attaché Chiba of the Japanese Embassy announced it at 8:00 AM in the military attaché's office. The content was the same as the "Notice" from the Beiping-Liaoning Railway. Chiba also released a statement in his personal capacity on his thoughts on the resumption of through train service, which was published in both English and Japanese. Due to the impending commencement of service on July 1, the Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau has assigned all personnel to serve on the through train, including 15 train conductors, train guards, and ticket inspectors, who will be divided into three shifts to serve in rotation. The train conductors assigned were Pang Jiaqin, Zhou Dechang, and Chen Tiqiang. The train used for the Beiping-Shenyang through service was driven from Fengtai to Tianjin yesterday for a test run. It is scheduled to return tomorrow (29th) and will depart from Qianmen on the evening of the 30th to travel to Shenyang on the first. Zhang Shuiqi, nominated by the China Travel Service to serve as the general manager of the Oriental Travel Agency, previously went to Yu Pass with four important staff members of the agency to negotiate and sign a contract with representatives from the Japanese South Manchuria Railway and the Tourist Bureau to jointly establish the Oriental Travel Agency. Except for the train schedule and ticket revenue settlement issues, all matters were negotiated and resolved. Both parties signed the contract in Yu Pass on the 27th and agreed that the Japanese side would relinquish part of the Beiping-Liaoning Railway buildings near the Yu Pass Station occupied by the Japanese army for use as the headquarters of the Oriental Travel Agency. Zhang Shuiqi returned to Tianjin from Yu Pass on the Beiping-Liaoning Railway's 8th train at 2:00 PM yesterday. Today, he will continue to work with representatives from the Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau and the Japanese side in Tianjin to negotiate and finalize issues such as the train schedule and ticket revenue settlement. Chen Xiangtao, the general manager of the China Travel Service, also took the Beiping-Liaoning Railway's 9th passenger train from Beiping to Tianjin at 2:25 PM this afternoon to participate in the negotiations. It is expected that everything will be completed today. The train schedule will be finalized today and will be sent to the China Travel Service, the Japanese International Tourist Bureau, and the Tongjilong Transportation Company for them to start selling tickets from July 1. The tickets are in two parts. When passing through Yu Pass, one part is torn off and kept by the Oriental Travel Agency for reference, and the remainder is given to the passenger to keep. When arriving at the final station, the railway bureau collects it for verification.</p>
<h3>Chiba Releases Statement</h3>
<p>Military Attaché Chiba of the Japanese Embassy released a statement today (the 28th) regarding his thoughts on the through train service. The English original is translated as follows: "The successful resolution of the through train issue is truly a cause for celebration for both China and Japan. This issue was a local and technical matter and should have been resolved sooner. However, due to the limitations of the complex environment, it was delayed until today. I do not wish to discuss the reasons for this. I sincerely hope that the resolution of the through train issue will be a precursor to increased friendly relations between China and Japan. Therefore, I am very pleased with the implementation of the through train service."</p>
<h3>Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau Notice</h3>
<p>Notice from the Beiping-Liaoning Railway Administration: "Regarding the issue of passenger trains passing between inside and outside the Pass, the Executive Yuan's Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee previously forwarded the Executive Yuan's order to negotiate with Japanese representatives based on the standards approved by the Premier of the Executive Yuan and the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. After carrying out negotiations and agreeing on specific measures, it has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and filing. It has now been decided to implement the measures from July 1. The measures are hereby announced as follows: 1. Starting from July 1 of this year, through passenger trains from Beiping to Liaoning will be restored, limited to one round trip per day between Beiping and Shenyang. 2. The Chinese side will be responsible for the China Travel Service, and the Japanese side will be responsible for the Japanese Tourist Bureau to jointly establish the Oriental Travel Agency in Shanhaiguan to manage the through train service. 3. All operating regulations, schedules, train formation, ticket sales, and other measures will be separately stipulated by the Railway Bureau. Director Yin Tong, June 28, 23rd year of the Republic of China."</p>
<h3>Process of Determining the Name</h3>
<p>During the meeting in Tianjin, it was decided with the agreement of both parties to name it the "Oriental Travel Agency." After the name was decided, four requirements were raised: 1. The Oriental Travel Agency should be registered in China and should comply with Chinese laws. 2. The general manager of the Oriental Travel Agency will always be Chinese. 3. The Oriental Travel Agency will only be related to the Beiping-Liaoning Railway, the Japanese Tourist Bureau, and the South Manchuria Railway, and will not conduct negotiations with any other third parties. 4. The selection of the general manager and deputy manager will be determined by the Chinese and Japanese sides respectively. After discussion, the Japanese side agreed to all the requests. The Tianjin meeting then came to an end.</p>
<h3>Organization of the Travel Agency</h3>
<p>The capital of the Oriental Travel Agency is set at one million yuan, with the China Travel Service and the Japanese International Tourist Bureau each contributing half. Both parties will designate banks to store the funds as a guarantee for train safety. The agency's expenses will only be covered by the 5% commission from the first, second, and third class passenger tickets sold for the Beiping-Shenyang through train service. If this is not enough, the railway bureau will subsidize the agency. The agency's headquarters will be located in Yu Pass, and no branch offices will be established. Ticket sales inside and outside the Pass will be handled separately by major stations and the China Travel Service and the Japanese International Tourist Bureau. Train operations will be the responsibility of the stations in each section inside and outside the Pass. The internal organization of the travel agency will be divided into four departments: 1. Documentation Department: responsible for transmitting official documents and compiling schedules. 2. Accounting Department: responsible for currency conversion between Chinese and Japanese systems and ticket revenue statistics. 3. General Affairs Department: responsible for all administrative affairs. 4. Sales Department: responsible for sales matters, and Zhang Shuiqi, a director of the China Travel Service, will be appointed as the general manager of the Oriental Travel Agency.</p>
<h3>Contract Signed in Yu Pass</h3>
<p>After the Tianjin meeting, Zhang Shuiqi, a director of the China Travel Service, and four others traveled to Yu Pass the day before yesterday to negotiate issues related to the through train service and sign the contract. The most important issue discussed in Yu Pass was the settlement issue. Since both sides have the same number of service personnel, capital, and stations inside and outside the Pass, both sides should collect ticket revenue separately, without the need for settlement procedures. The Japanese side has not yet agreed to this, using the universal postal system as an example. In addition, the procedures for inspecting the carriages passing through Yu Pass also need to be negotiated. The Japanese side has sent Adachi, a representative from the South Manchuria Railway, to Yu Pass to discuss all matters. It will not be difficult to reach a decision. The announcement of the plan today and the implementation of the through train service on July 1 will not be delayed as a result.</p>
<h3>Mr. Chen Xiangtao Discusses Solutions</h3>
<p>Chen Xiangtao, the general manager of China Travel Service, discussed the case of operating passenger trains between Beiping and Shenyang, stating that the government decided to have a commercial organization handle it. Among domestic travel businesses independently operated by Chinese with proven success, China Travel Service was the only one. The government instructed the company to jointly establish the Oriental Travel Service with the Japan Tourist Bureau to handle special express train services, with a Chinese national serving as the general manager. After receiving an official letter from the Ministry of Railways, China Travel Service initially hesitated to take on the task, but the government's urging made it difficult to refuse. From the perspective of the nation, especially during times of national crisis, they felt compelled to contribute their efforts. Therefore, the company's board of directors held repeated meetings and finally decided to comply with the government's order and undertake the Oriental Travel Service project. Once the Oriental Travel Service is established, significant expenses are anticipated. It is rumored that the allocated funds, consisting of only five percent commission from railway ticket sales, will be insufficient. However, China Travel Service views this matter as serving the nation and the people inside and outside the Great Wall, and they will not hesitate to bear any losses.</p>
<h3>Unscrupulous Merchants Seize Opportunity to Profit</h3>
<p>With the imminent opening of through train service between Beiping and Shenyang, unscrupulous merchants in Beiping are transporting copper coins into the country, hoping to profit. The Bureau of Social Affairs sent a letter to the Bureaus of Finance and Public Safety, requesting them to dispatch representatives to discuss methods to prevent this, in order to maintain financial stability. The original letter is as follows: "Upon investigation, the price of copper coins in our city plummeted after last year's sharp decline. The Municipal Government repeatedly ordered this bureau to work with your bureau and the Bureaus of Finance (and Public Safety) to take strict measures. Representatives from the three bureaus and the Chamber of Commerce were dispatched daily to the money market to set exchange rate standards for restriction. However, recently, the puppet regime revised the currency system, effective June 1st, prohibiting the sale and circulation of copper coins, with violators being charged with disrupting the financial order. Unscrupulous merchants are taking advantage of this opportunity to buy up large quantities of copper coins and transport them into the country as much as possible. As a result, the amount of copper coins in the country has skyrocketed, and the price has plummeted. Currently, in Tianjin, Yangcun, Tangshan, and other places, each yuan can be exchanged for as many as 580 to 600 copper coins. Copper coins are everywhere, but commodity prices are calculated in silver yuan, causing small vendors and laborers to complain incessantly. Although the price of copper coins in our city is under strict surveillance, it is still falling daily. Currently, each yuan can be exchanged for 525 or 526 copper coins. The previous stability has gradually been shaken. This not only affects the livelihood of ordinary people but also impacts the overall economic situation of our city. If measures are not taken early, the future is worrisome. Once the through train service is realized, it will be even more difficult to prevent, which is especially concerning. Now, it is proposed to follow the Municipal Government's previous order and reconvene a meeting to discuss methods to restrict the decline in the price of copper coins, in order to uphold the law and maintain the people's livelihood. Besides sending separate letters, this letter is sent for your review and to request that you dispatch representatives to jointly discuss the matter." (28th)</p>
<h3>Amidst Intense Bandit Suppression, Sichuan Province Strives for New Initiatives, Liu Xiang Convenes Subordinates to Give Instructions and Announce Regulations, Establishes New Life Movement Group and Use of Domestic Goods Association</h3>

Liu gave important instructions, roughly stating: "Since the establishment of this headquarters in the province, it has been almost a year. Due to the complexity of affairs, I have not had the opportunity to convene a meeting for discussion. Today, as we gather together, I would like to propose two matters for your consideration: one is the organization of the New Life Movement Group in this headquarters, and the other is the establishment of the Use of Domestic Goods Committee in this headquarters. Although these two matters are clearly separate, their ultimate goal is to achieve the purpose of saving the country and benefiting the people. Currently, the national crisis is severe, the economy is bankrupt, and the general public is accustomed to extravagance. Living habits are all unreasonable. If this continues, the Chinese nation will fall into an incurable state. Chairman Chiang cannot bear to see our inherent virtues disappear, so he initiated the New Life Movement. The whole country responded enthusiastically, and the atmosphere has been renewed. Chengdu and Chongqing have also gradually promoted it. In fact, the essence of the New Life Movement, such as filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, as well as diligence, frugality, and simplicity, are all inherent good habits. The reason for naming it the New Life Movement is merely that these virtues and good practices have long disappeared and need to be restored. These regulations are all simple and easy to implement. If we can all persevere, then once habits are formed, any difficulties can be overcome. This headquarters is a high-level administrative organ, and the lives and actions of all staff members can influence society. If we do not strive to implement the New Life Movement, then the general bad habits will be difficult to change. However, the regulations of the New Life Movement Group organized by this headquarters this time are based on complete implementation. Therefore, you must carefully consider when seeking opinions, and if you feel that you cannot implement them, do not force yourself to join, so as not to become an obstacle to promotion." After Liu finished speaking, he designated Zhang Biguo to read the regulations of the New Life Movement Group. After reading, Gao Qi, the secretary of the political affairs office, read the articles of association and implementation methods of the Use of Domestic Goods Association. The meeting adjourned at 4:50 PM. (June 26th)</p>

<h3>Changshu: Rice Prices Soar Amidst Severe Drought</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been extremely hot. It has been even worse in the past four days. According to older people, this kind of extreme heat has not been seen in nearly twenty years. In addition, there has been no rain, and the rivers have dried up, making it impossible for farmers to draw water. The fields are cracked. In the higher fields, the rice seedlings have already turned yellow. Farmers are all worried. Even the wells of residents in the urban area are nearly dry. If there is no rain, there will be a major problem with drinking water. Therefore, there have been rituals for praying for rain in various places recently. Although the matter is superstitious, the authorities cannot prohibit it. Because of all this, rice merchants hoarding rice are taking advantage of this opportunity to raise rice prices. Yesterday, the ticket price for top-quality white rice reached more than nine yuan. Soon, it will exceed ten yuan. Poor people are extremely panicked.</p>

<h3>Changzhou: Telephonic Request to Protect Educational Funding Independence</h3>
<p>The Wuyi County Education Association, in response to the Department of Finance's order to implement the measures for the collection, expenditure, and deposit of county funds in each county starting on July 1st, believes that it endangers the independence of educational funding. Therefore, yesterday (the 28th), it telegraphed the Provincial Government's Department of Education, stating that educational funding has special circumstances and is difficult to equate with other expenses. If the county treasury measures are implemented, there will be many obstacles. It requested that the spirit of joint consultation and independence be maintained and made three suggestions: (1) For the safekeeping of educational funding in each county, it is proposed to establish a county education funding management office, modeled after the provincial funding collection and expenditure measures. (2) The educational funding audit committee in each county should expand its powers to thoroughly review revenue and expenditure accounts. (3) The educational funding safekeeping plan in this province does not violate party guidelines or any laws and regulations, has been implemented for many years, and has been quite effective. It should be appropriately preserved to strengthen the foundation. As for the county funding collection, expenditure, and deposit measures that are suitable for use, they may also be adopted together to achieve perfection.</p>

<h3>The Panchen Lama Advanced to the Capital Last Night, Mayor Wu and Others Went to the North Station to See Him Off, He Will Remain in the Capital Temporarily to Meet with Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>The National Government Commissioner, the Panchen Lama, has been warmly welcomed by all circles since arriving in Shanghai. The Lama is urgently required to advance to the Capital to discuss with the Central Government all the procedures for preparing to return to Tibet. It was originally scheduled to set out yesterday morning, but due to the hot weather, it was changed to 11:00 PM last night to travel to the Capital by night train.</p>
<h3>Station Decoration</h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau attached a large floral carriage to the night train yesterday for the Lama to ride in. The inside and outside of the car were covered with yellow silk. There were also two first and second class special cars and two luggage cars. A yellow silk archway was erected in front of the North Station gate, with the words "Farewell" written on it. The platform was also decorated with yellow lanterns. Military police were densely deployed inside and outside the station, and the Public Security Bureau's military band played music to see him off.</p>

<h3>The Process of Through Train Negotiations, The Oriental Travel Service Does Not Establish a Branch in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The much-talked-about through train issue has now been officially announced. Starting tomorrow, it will be officially implemented. It is rumored that there will be one train running in each direction between Beiping and Shenyang tomorrow, both of which are trial runs. Passengers will be officially carried starting on the 2nd. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited someone familiar with the process of the case. According to the discussion, the authorities were afraid that this issue might involve acknowledging the puppet Manchuria and were therefore very cautious from the beginning. Therefore, before the negotiations began, they approved three standard measures for through train service: (1) Limit one passenger train running in each direction per day. (2) The through train service will be undertaken by a commercial organization organized in accordance with Chinese law. (3) The commercial organization will liaise with the Railway Bureau on all accounts and business matters. After these standard measures were approved, a secret order was issued to the Political Affairs Reorganization Committee stationed in Beiping, instructing the Beining Railway Bureau to carefully negotiate with the Japanese side. The through train measures published in various newspapers yesterday were actually the result of the Beining Railway Bureau Chief Yin Tong's consultations with the Japanese side in accordance with the predetermined principles.</p>
<p>Another report states that the reporter inquired with the China Travel Service and was told by Chief Hua of the General Affairs Department that the price list and tickets for the Beiping-Shenyang through train have not yet arrived, so they cannot be sold. The director, Chen Xiangtao, has not received confirmation of when he will return to Shanghai. Another piece of information is that the train tickets and price lists for the Beiping-Shenyang through train will be sent to Shanghai today (30th). Starting tomorrow, China Travel Service and the Japan International Tourist Bureau will begin selling them. It is rumored that the Oriental Travel Service will not establish a branch in Shanghai. All matters will be handled by China Travel Service and the Japan Tourist Bureau.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Advanced to the Capital Last Night, Returning to Hubei Province to Resume Duties</h3>

He returned to Shanghai by train the night before and took the night train to the capital last night to return to Hubei Province and resume his duties.</p>
<h3>Incident of Japanese Sailors Clashing with Western Police, Both Parties Conduct Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>The Great American Evening News says that the incident of the Japanese Marine Corps clashing with Western policemen on Zhapu Road will be thoroughly investigated by the Public Works Department and the Police Department. Although the details of the organization of the investigation committee are still unknown, it is said that it will pursue the truth, determine the responsibility, and begin processing it soon. After the investigation, a detailed statement will be issued by the Public Works Department. The Japanese Marine Corps will also send a representative to attend the investigation meeting as an observer. The Japanese authorities are still working to minimize the seriousness of this case.</p>
<p>The Continental News said that officials from the Public Works Department, the Police Department, and the Japanese Consulate remained silent yesterday regarding the clashes between the Japanese Marine Corps and Western policemen on Wednesday night and Thursday morning. Sterling Fessenden, director-general of the Public Works Department, told the Continental News reporter yesterday that Chief Inspector Joly had submitted a report, but did not comment further. The report is confidential, and the case has not yet begun to be investigated, as the Public Works Department is currently allowing the Japanese authorities to handle it. McNaughton, acting chairman of the Public Works Department, said that the Public Works Department did not want to comment on the case at this time. An official from the Japanese Consulate stated yesterday that the case is now in the hands of the Public Works Department, and the Public Works Department is currently conducting an investigation. An officer of the Japanese Special Marine Corps stated that the Japanese will attend the meeting to testify when the investigation is complete and indicated that no other steps have been taken. When the officer of the Japanese Special Marine Corps was interviewed by the Continental News reporter, he insisted that the Western police officer, Perami, had drawn his pistol and pointed it at the Japanese sailors. He also said that the reason for keeping Perami at the police station for six hours was to prevent him from going out and being injured by the crowd. He also said that in 1927, the Public Works Department had agreed with the Japanese authorities that patrolmen could not detain Japanese soldiers at the police station for questioning. When the case is investigated in the future, it is intended to present a letter signed by the chief inspector as evidence. Because of this agreement, he sincerely felt that the actions of the Japanese sailors on Wednesday night were justified. Now, looking at the overall situation of the case, the points of contention in this case are whether Perami actually drew his pistol, whether Perami was forcibly detained for six hours, and whether the Public Works Department had an agreement that patrolmen could not arrest Japanese soldiers at the police station in peacetime. According to the previous Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese authorities insisted that, due to the state of war, patrolmen in the concession could not arrest Japanese soldiers. At that time, the police station detained several Japanese ruffians who were disrupting public order, but after the Japanese authorities lodged a serious protest, they were released.</p>

The Second Regiment of the Military Police of the Garrison Command also formed a special patrol team to patrol back and forth in the Nanshi city area.

<p>The 17th Changzhou-Shanghai commuter train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway caused the complete destruction of the last third-class baggage and passenger car, IBV No. 943, and the partial destruction of the third-class passenger car TP758 at 11:32 AM yesterday when it arrived at the North Station Yangqi section. The fourth track, the 26th turnout, and platforms 5 and 6 and their roofs were also damaged. The conductor, Li Shijun, as well as three passengers, two railway police officers, and one employee of the Datong Transportation Company were injured at the scene and have been admitted to the Railway Hospital for treatment. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Circumstances of the Accident</h3>
<p>The 17th Changzhou-Shanghai commuter train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway departed from Changzhou at 6:00 AM yesterday. According to the timetable, it was supposed to arrive in Shanghai at 11:35 AM, but it traveled faster than expected yesterday and arrived three minutes early. When the train reached the North Yangqi section on the Hanqiao Bridge, it should have entered the fifth track and stopped at platform 6. Unexpectedly, the frog of the turnout there was not tightly connected and was loosened after the vibration. When the last (TBV) third-class and baggage mixed car No. 943 passed over it, the rear four wheels of the car turned into the fourth track due to the change in the direction of the frog. However, the fourth and fifth tracks were separated by a platform. As the front and rear wheels of the car traveled in different directions, the car body crossed the platform and advanced, first breaking the cement pillars of the two platforms, and the roof also collapsed immediately, destroying more than two zhang (approximately 6.6 meters). The sound was as loud as the explosion of a giant bomb. For a time, the passengers on the train were all frightened and at a loss. Before long, the front and rear wheels all fell off and sank on the fourth and fifth tracks, respectively. However, the car did not stop at this time, so the car body was dragged off the platform and onto the fifth track. After being shaken again, the middle of the car body was broken and fell on the left side of platform 6.</p>
<h3>Seven People Injured</h3>
<p>The injured in the train derailment included the guard Li Shijun, three passengers (two men and one woman), two railway police officers, and one silver dollar escort from the Dafeng Company, totaling seven people. Except for the heavily injured Dafeng Company escort who was sent to Renji Hospital, the rest were sent to the Railway Hospital by train.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Damage</h3>
<p>The damage included the complete destruction of one TBV 943 baggage and third-class passenger mixed car, the rear end of the TP756 third-class passenger car, and partial damage to the PC3 flower car. More than ten zhang of platform 6, more than ten zhang of platform 5, the frogs of the fourth and fifth tracks, two cement pillars of the platform roof, more than three zhang of the roof, more than two zhang of track, and twenty-seven sleepers were destroyed. The estimated material loss is about more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Police Dispatched to Maintain Order</h3>
<p>After the incident, Director Xiao of the Transportation Department, Deputy Director Liu, and the stationmaster rushed to the scene to inspect. They first sent the injured to the hospital for treatment and informed Director Huang Boqiao by telegram. They also notified the Mechanical and Engineering Departments to send workers to repair the damage and dispatched a large number of railway police to stand at the entrances of platforms 5 and 6 and the scene of the accident, strictly prohibiting outsiders from entering to observe.</p>
<h3>Actively Repairing</h3>
<p>After the incident, the Transportation Department immediately notified the Wusong Machine Factory and the Engineering and Mechanical Departments by telephone, dispatching a large number of workers to actively repair the damage. Upon receiving the telegram, the Wusong Machine Factory immediately dispatched two rescue vehicles, carrying 246 workers, and a crane to the scene of the accident. They first lifted the derailed passenger car onto the rescue vehicle with the crane and drove to the Wusong Machine Factory for repairs. They also dismantled the roof and replaced the track sleepers. All repairs were completed by 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Investigating the Cause of the Accident</h3>
<p>Director Huang Boqiao of the Two-Road Administration went to the scene to investigate at 2:00 PM yesterday, considering the bizarre nature of the incident and the responsibility for it urgently needed to be investigated. He immediately summoned the Director and Deputy Director of the Transportation Department, the Director and Deputy Director of the Engineering Department, the Director and Deputy Director of the Mechanical Department, the driver of the derailed train, the stationmaster of the North Station, the Chief Inspector, and the Chief of the General Section to hold a temporary emergency meeting in the North Station conference room to discuss the cause of the accident. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. The results of the meeting have not yet been released.</p>
<h3>The City Finance Bureau Prepares to Take Over the Business License Tax for Tobacco and Alcohol, Which Will Be Entirely Transferred to Local Governments Starting from July 1</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of transferring the business license tax for tobacco and alcohol to the provinces and cities for collection, after the city government approved the request from the Ministry of Finance to investigate and handle the matter, the city government specifically ordered the city finance bureau yesterday to prepare to take over the collection within a specified period, starting from July 1. The original order of the city government is recorded as follows: According to the Ministry of Finance's inquiry, the business license tax for tobacco and alcohol is essentially a business tax. In June of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the National Government promulgated the Business Tax Law, which stipulated in Article 2 that "the central government shall collect the business license tax for tobacco and alcohol. After retaining one-tenth for the central government, the rest should be allocated to the provinces and cities as local revenue." The stamp tax and tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus of the provinces under the jurisdiction of the Ministry have been collecting and allocating funds in accordance with regulations. After the abolition of miscellaneous taxes and fees, the method of compensation was determined by the conference resolution to transfer all business license tax for tobacco and alcohol to local governments for collection in order to increase revenue, considering the possibility of insufficient local financial resources. The secretariat of the conference presented the resolution for review and handling. The Ministry re-examined and verified that this business license tax for tobacco and alcohol should be collected by the central government according to the provisions of the Business Tax Law. However, given the aforementioned situation, the Ministry should approve the change to local self-management in order to adjust local finances and facilitate collection. It is now scheduled to be implemented from July 1 of this year. Please instruct your city government to instruct the finance bureau to follow the central laws and regulations to collect the tax. The Ministry will still print the required licenses for whole or retail sales of tobacco and alcohol in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and instruct the bureau to list the detailed numbers, prepare the printing costs, and present them to the Ministry for collection in order to unify and facilitate verification. The detailed rules for implementation are attached, and please instruct your city government to investigate and handle them, and report the handling situation after the takeover and how to reduce the burden on the people at any time for verification. The provisional regulations for the business license tax for tobacco and alcohol and the detailed rules for implementation are attached. This order is hereby issued to the bureau for compliance (the regulations are omitted).</p>
<h3>The City Farmers' Association Submits a Request to the Social Affairs Bureau to Stop the Rise in Rice Prices, as It Does Not Benefit Farmers and Instead Increases Their Burden, and Should Be Stopped to Avoid Affecting People's Food Supply</h3>
<p>This summer has been rainless and the weather is extremely hot. It is generally speculated that a drought has formed. Rice merchants are taking the opportunity to raise rice prices. The Farmers' Association believes that the rise in rice prices not only affects people's food supply but also has a great impact on the livelihood of farmers. Yesterday, it specially submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to stop the continued rise in rice prices in order to maintain the livelihood of farmers and benefit people's food supply. The original request is recorded as follows: For the soaring rice prices, profiteers monopolize and hoard, please devise a way to stop them, to maintain the livelihood of farmers and benefit the people's food affairs. I have learned that this summer, the seasonal rains have been out of order, and the weather is dry. The ports and rivers are dry. The farmland in the four rural villages lacks rain. As a result, rice and cotton crops are both lacking rain and are scorched by the scorching sun, showing a withered and poor harvest. Farmers are worried and worried. At this time of drought and disaster, and at the time of the green and yellow shortages, rice prices have suddenly risen and are continuing to rise daily. The future of the people's food supply is greatly affected, and the impact on farmers is particularly significant. In recent years, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and the farmers' economy has become increasingly impoverished. The income from the harvest is not enough to provide warmth and fullness for a family. How can there be surplus grain for profit? The rise in rice prices, according to the saying that cheap grain hurts farmers, must think that this can increase the income of farmers, but do not know that in fact, it is no different from increasing the hardship of farmers' livelihoods. Because farmers often eat next year's food this year, and the income from the harvest is not enough to repay debts, let alone anything else. Once the harvest is sold, it is sold out. The current rise in rice prices not only does not help farmers but also increases the burden on farmers, and is only for general profiteers to hoard and monopolize to enrich their own pockets. I believe that people's food supply is the lifeline of the country, and farmers are the source of people's food supply. Looking forward to the future, the hidden worries are endless. Therefore, I dare to prepare a document and ask your bureau to devise a way to stop it, so that each stone (approximately 59.2 kg) does not exceed ten yuan, in order to maintain the livelihood of farmers and benefit the people's food supply. I implore you to be considerate of the people's difficulties and grant what I have requested. I am anxiously awaiting orders, and I present this to Wu, the Director of the Shanghai City Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3>Bank Industry Half-Year Account Settlement, Chinese and Foreign Banks Will Be Closed Tomorrow, and Will Resume Business on the 4th</h3>
<p>All Chinese and foreign banks will be closed tomorrow (i.e., July 1) for the half-year account settlement, as usual. Most foreign banks and Chinese banks that have joined the Foreign Merchant Bank Association will close their doors for three days from the 1st to the 3rd and resume business on the 4th. Chinese banks are unevenly closed, with some opening on the 3rd and fully returning to normal on the 4th.</p>
<h3>The Seattle Mail Ship Will Resume Sailing Today, and the President Grant Has Already Sailed</h3>
<p>After the U.S. dockworkers went on strike, the Seattle route on the Shanghai-Pacific route has been completely blocked, and no ships have come. Those on the San Francisco route have also changed to Los Angeles. The losses suffered by the shipping companies in Shanghai are very large, especially the U.S. Mail Company. From May 18 to the present, the Seattle route alone has been stopped due to the strike, and the number of passengers who were unable to depart and therefore refunded their tickets is no less than a thousand, including group passengers, in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Xiaoluson. Some have changed to take ships to Vancouver and Los Angeles. Also, after the strike, the number of mail ships in the Pacific has been greatly reduced, and many ships have been stationed in various ports. Yesterday, the local Dalai Foreign Firm received a telegram from its head office that the four mail ships blocked in Seattle, including the President Grant, have found a way to unload the accumulated cargo from the ship, and the ship can resume sailing from Seattle today. The other ships, such as the President McKinley, the President Jackson, and the President Jefferson, are also finding ways to restore the Sino-U.S. route.</p>
<h3>The Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation Changes the Call Method in Each District, Expands the Number of Lines Connecting to the Concession to Seventy Pairs, and Specifies Three Types of Small Private Branch Exchanges</h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the new phone book of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation changes the call method. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Call Method in Each District The new phone book of the Telephone Bureau specifies the call method in each district: (A) For calls from Nanshi, Zhabei, and Longhua to various districts, (1) The mutual call method is still the same as the automatic telephone method, dialing directly; (2) To connect to Pudong, dial 36; to Jiangwan, dial 41161; to Zhenru (attached to Nanxiang), dial 41141; to Wusong (attached to Baoshan), dial 41181; (3) To connect to the concession, listen for the "0" sound and transfer the number; (B) For calls from Pudong, Jiangwan, Zhenru, and Wusong to various districts, (1) The mutual call method is to call according to the shared telephone method; (2) To connect to Nanshi, Zhabei, and Longhua, listen for the call according to the magneto telephone method; (3) To connect to the concession, listen for the call according to the magneto telephone method. The new phone book has been printed and distributed to users.</p>
<p>Increasing the Number of Lines Connecting to the Concession In order to maintain convenient communication, the bureau has changed the lines connecting Nanshi to the concession to underground lines, and the lines in Zhabei to armored cables. In addition to the completion of the Nanshi part, the telephone branch bureau in the city center will be established in August since its construction. In addition, due to the busy communication between the Chinese concession and the rental concession, the bureau has decided to expand the "0" switchboard starting next month, increasing it from fifty pairs of lines to seventy pairs, in order to facilitate user communication.</p>
<p>Small Private Branch Exchange Styles The bureau also believes that the small private branch exchanges of users in various districts have different styles and are difficult to maintain. Therefore, it has been approved by the Ministry of Transportation to divide them into three types according to the needs of users: mutual communication type, board key type, and standing type, depending on the number of relay lines and extensions. Those with one to ten extensions use the board key type, and those with sixteen to fifty extensions use the standing type. The Chief Engineer of the Bureau, Yu Bingjian, has been conducting inspections in various districts for this purpose in recent days in order to proceed with the project.</p>
<h3>The Lawyers' Association Requests Again to Abolish the Real Estate Mortgage Rules, as They Conflict with the Civil Code</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association, in opposition to the Shanghai City Government's approval and promulgation of the Real Estate Mortgage Registration Rules by the Land Bureau, believes that the city's individual rules clearly conflict with the current Civil Code. It has petitioned the Ministry of Judicial Administration to forward it to the Executive Yuan, requesting that the Shanghai City Government be ordered to abolish these city's individual rules. After the approval of the Yuan and Ministry, it was not approved and has been delayed until now. Recently, a member, Qian Zhongdao, made a suggestion, requesting that the association continue to petition the Yuan and Ministry, ordering the abolition to correct the situation. After the association submitted it to the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committee members, the meeting decided to pass it. It immediately appointed a drafting committee to draft a document to petition the Ministry of Judicial Administration and specially submit it to the Executive Yuan for continued petition. It has been issued yesterday, and the original text roughly states that the city's individual rules do conflict with the current Civil Code. Please forward it to the Executive Yuan to order the Shanghai City Government to immediately abolish the Real Estate Mortgage Registration Rules approved and promulgated by the Land Bureau in order to correct the situation. It is really a public envoy. (The original text is omitted)</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai Resigns as Supervisor of the City Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, has presided over the affairs of the association for four years and was re-elected as a supervisor in this election. Mr. Wang has been serving merchant organizations for fifteen years and is exhausted physically and mentally and urgently needs to rest. He sent a special letter of resignation yesterday, stating in the letter: I am writing to inform you that the Chamber of Commerce Law stipulates that the term of office of executive and supervisory committee members is four years and cannot be re-elected. The intention of the legislation is to average work and rest on the one hand, and to prevent control on the other hand. If an executive committee member completes his term of office and is still a supervisor, although the duties of the association are different, he cannot shirk his responsibility. Moreover, if an executive committee member completes his term of office and is elected as a supervisor, and a supervisor completes his term of office and is again elected as an executive committee member, it is different in name but the same in reality. It is a permanent re-election without re-election. Xiaolai believes that this is not possible. From Xiaolai's personal point of view, he has been serving as a member and director of the Chamber of Commerce for fifteen years. Since he served as the Chairman of the Zhabei Chamber of Commerce, the Association for the Business Exhibition, and the Committee for the Reorganization of Merchant Organizations, and until the four-year term of office of the Chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce is over, it has been eight years. The scope of serving the society has been expanding day by day, and the operation of private businesses has been almost completely abandoned. Xiaolai believes that he did not become rich by serving the society, but gradually became thin due to taking care of production. This heart can be seen by heaven and earth. It is also what is called one is happy, one is afraid. What is happy is that in the past terms of office, I did not seek merit, but I was not ashamed. All matters were handled with public tolerance, strictness, and emphasis on honesty. I can be responsible for the two words "honesty". What is afraid is that if this continues, I will lose sight of one thing while paying attention to another. If I do not plan for production, there will be a day when I will break my foot and overturn the pot. How can I be sustained by sacrificing myself to cultivate others? Thinking of this, I shudder. Therefore, I specially express my sincerity and ask to be allowed to resign from the position of supervisor and have the candidate supervisor take over in accordance with the regulations. Xiaolai recalls that during his term of office, in the Zhabei Chamber of Commerce, in the 16th year of the Republic of China, he drove Sun out of the market in order to stabilize Jiangnan. In the City Chamber of Commerce, in the 128th year, he resisted Japan in order to protect the national territory. Although the internal and external troubles are different, the urgency of pacification and supply is the same. I forgot to dress and eat and spent the night without sleep. After a life of worry, I will not cherish it again. In the future, I will still use the qualifications of a member representative to assist at any time, and I will not dare not strive to do what I can. This is to inform you specifically, and I hope you will understand it. This is addressed to the Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce. June 29.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Holds the Licensing of Private Rickshaw Pullers</h3>

<h3>News of the Labor Strike at the British American Tobacco Factory: Public Security Bureau Orders Union to Withdraw Maintenance Team; City Government Responds, Vowing No Illegal Interference</h3>

<h3>Continuous Hot Weather Causes Drought; Many Narrow Rivers in Rural Areas Gradually Drying Up; Farmers Compete to Draw Water, Fearing Disappointing Autumn Harvest</h3>
<p>The weather has been extremely hot recently. According to the astronomical observatory, it is the hottest in sixty years. Currently, although the farmers in the countryside have finished transplanting rice seedlings, they desperately need water. They are drawing water from the rivers, but if it continues to not rain, the rivers will dry up, making it impossible to draw water, and the autumn harvest will be disappointing. Regarding ship traffic, according to people from the countryside, they have to get into the water and push the boats in shallow areas, otherwise they cannot move forward. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency specifically interviewed the Inland Waterways Navigation Bureau yesterday to inquire whether there were any obstacles to ships traveling to the interior. According to the bureau, ships traveling from Shanghai to the interior, such as Pinghu, Suzhou, Wuxi, Huzhou, Changshu, etc., are operating as usual and have not been affected in any way. However, rivers in small towns and cities between urban and rural areas have been affected by farmers drawing water for irrigation and the lack of rain, and most of them are experiencing drought.</p>

<p>The sixth drawing of the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery was held in public at the Yiyuan Garden on Albert Road at 2 PM yesterday. Approximately 5,000 to 6,000 representatives from various agencies and organizations and members of the public attended. After inspecting the lottery balls, Wang Xiaolai gave a brief report, and then the drawing began on time at 2 PM and ended at 4 PM. The grand prize was drawn in the last half hour. Because it had not been sold, a special prize, No. 278487, was drawn again, which was sold in Ganzhou. The prize money for each prize will be paid out from July 7th. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Venue</h3>
<p>The drawing venue was still located in the central section of the Yiyuan Garden's main grandstand. However, instead of the temporary mat sheds built in the past, steel frames were used this time, and the tents were made of red and white canvas, which was easy to assemble and disassemble and very beautiful. The flags of the Party and the country were hung on the stage, and three large and small copper balls were placed in the center, as before. Loudspeakers were hung everywhere, and the announcement of the numbers could be heard clearly in the venue. Chinese and foreign detectives from the French Concession were also present to maintain order.</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>Those who attended yesterday included the association's Chinese and foreign committee members, office director Zheng Lai, secretary Huang Guoen, and all staff members, as well as Zhang Shouyong, advisor to the Ministry of Finance, Luo Panhui, representative of the City Government, Wang Xiaolai and Bei Songsun, representatives of the City Chamber of Commerce, Lin Kanghou, representative of the Bankers Association, Wang Enmo, President of the Second Special District Court, Li Ping, Chief Clerk, and Du Yuesheng, Gui Yanfang, Xu Xinliu, Hu Yunqiu, Wen Yu, Wang Fushen, and others. Five to six thousand members of the public also attended, sitting in the grandstand in the sweltering heat of over 100 degrees, all sweating profusely.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang's Report</h3>
<p>After the representatives of the various agencies arrived, the prize codes were inspected and poured into the copper balls one by one. Then, Wang Xiaolai gave a report, saying that the sixth National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery drawing was being held here today. The time had come, and all the procedures were completed. All the prize codes had been inspected by the representatives and were correct. The drawing would begin on time. After Secretary Gong translated the report into English, the copper balls were shaken and the drawing began.</p>
<h3>Prizes Drawn</h3>
<p>After the drawing, the first prize was the fifth prize. The second prize was the fourth prize, No. 123657, and the audience in the venue was immediately excited. Then, several fifth and sixth prizes were drawn. Half an hour later, one third prize, No. 073916, was drawn. At three o'clock, the second prize, No. 171551, was drawn, as well as several third and fourth prizes. The weather was hot and humid, but the audience continued to arrive, sweating like rain, still standing and watching with great concern. When the first prize number was drawn, the whole venue burst into an uproar. However, when the number was announced for the last twentieth time as No. 025251, another person announced that the first prize, worth 500,000 yuan, had not been won. The audience checked the lottery tickets they had brought to see if they were lucky enough to win, but the excitement of hoping for several hours suddenly faded, and many people quietly left the venue.</p>
<h3>Special Prize Drawn Separately</h3>
<p>After the first to sixth prizes were drawn, the seventh prize codes were poured into ball A and shaken well. The three characters "504" were drawn for the seventh prize. Finally, Secretary Huang reported that the first prize number, 025251, had not been sold. Therefore, according to previous practice, a special prize was drawn instead, but the last digits of the eighth, ninth, and second prizes would still be the same as the first prize number. Then, the special prize was drawn as No. 278487. It was reported that it was issued by the Dayun Company and sold by the Liu Huishengtang in Ganzhou, Jiangxi. The winner could not be found. Another second prize was sold by the Tianjin branch of the China National Products Bank. Two fourth prizes were sold in Shanghai by Daliyuan and Li Fengji. Two third prizes were sold, one in Hangzhou and one in Shanghai. An employee of the Dayun Company heard that he had won the second prize.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Committee to Hold Meeting to Discuss Licensing Issues</h3>
<p>The International Settlement Rickshaw Committee announced yesterday that the monthly fee for each rickshaw substitute donor license is 15 yuan and 67 cents. According to a statement issued by the person in charge of the Rickshaw Industry Office in the Special District, the monthly fee for each rickshaw license in the British Concession is 2 yuan and 4 cents, 2 yuan and 2 cents in the French Concession, and 1 yuan and 5 cents in the Chinese Concession, plus 10 cents for the association fee and 5 cents for the material donation, totaling 5 yuan and 26 cents. Substitute donors pay for licenses, vehicle inspections, and other matters, so they collect a total of 5 yuan and 50 cents per month, with a profit of only 24 cents. However, the Rickshaw Committee announced that according to reports from rickshaw owners, many owners who wanted to obtain licenses themselves were blocked. All kinds of statements are unfounded. The rickshaw merchants resolved at the last rickshaw owners' conference that they were unwilling to accept the Rickshaw Committee's facilities and refused to do so. Therefore, it was not the substitute donors who blocked them. They also requested the Municipal Council to revoke the name of the Rickshaw Committee and return all rickshaw matters to the jurisdiction of the Vehicle Affairs Department. Now, the committee actually claims that the owners agree with the Rickshaw Committee's proposals. Moreover, according to the notices recently distributed by the Rickshaw Committee to various rickshaws, they want to obtain certificates. Therefore, the industry has decided to hold a general meeting at the association at 3 PM tomorrow (30th) to discuss this matter. At the same time, due to the establishment of a clinic and pharmacy, they will make plans for the establishment.</p>

<h3>Yangtze Flour Mill Adopts Domestic Machinery</h3>
<p>The Xie Da Machinery Factory, a member of the Shanghai Copper and Iron Machinery Industry Association, located at 314 Kunming Road, manufactures flour milling machinery and sells it throughout the country for many years. The factory has been carefully researching and has made many improvements in manufacturing in recent years. The original machinery of the Nanjing Yangtze Flour Company was purchased from abroad. Recently, due to the expansion of its business, the output was insufficient to meet demand. In order to promote domestic machinery, it specially purchased new machinery from Xie Da Machinery Factory. Since it was put into trial use, the results have been very excellent. Compared with the original foreign machinery, it can be on par, and the value is even cheaper. From now on, flour mills in our country can purchase domestic machinery to avoid outflowing of profits to foreign countries. It is heard that the Yangtze Company has given Xie Da Machinery Factory much encouragement and is introducing it, which is also good news in the promotion of domestic machinery.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to French Municipal Council to Issue Certificates for Lost Vehicle Permits</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the French Concession Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, on the 28th of this month, according to a letter from the Rickshaw Industry Association, the members of the Association pay donations and obtain licenses from the French Concession Municipal Council every month, with each person's donation amount specified and reliable shop guarantees on file. However, when vehicles are operating outside, licenses are often lost or stolen due to the rickshaw pullers' carelessness or other reasons. Once lost, it is necessary to wait until the new license is received after the next month's donation before business can resume. During the period after the license is lost and before the new license is received, it is impossible to operate within the French Concession, resulting in considerable losses. The Association previously sent a letter to the French Municipal Council requesting that, in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Finance Bureau, when a French license is lost or stolen, the Association should issue a letter of proof, and a temporary permit should be issued to allow continued business. We respectfully request that your Council appeal on behalf of the Association and earnestly request the French Municipal Council to promptly implement the aforementioned method for the sake of business, which is truly a matter of public convenience." After investigating, it was found that the license is lost, it will be required to pay the donation for the next month before they are renewed, and the time between the lost time and the renewed time is long, the loss of the rickshaw is definitely not small. Our municipal finance bureau already has the method of supplying temporary permit when the license is lost, then your board do the same thing in Shanghai area, it will be very convenient, and the benefit of rickshaw business is great. Accordingly, we send you the letter, please follow suit, it is real a public affair."</p>

<h3>Zhang Asi, a Bandit, Found to Be Related to the Assassination of Du Nanxi</h3>
<p>Du Nanxi, a native of Sichuan, 23 years old, graduated from the Municipal Administration Department of Fudan University and returned to Sichuan after becoming engaged to Ding Suhui, a female classmate from Jinshan. In March of last year, Du came to Shanghai from Sichuan to get married. Because Ms. Ding returned to Jinshan at this time, Du stayed at the Fudan University dormitory in Jiangwan. On the morning of the 24th of the same month, he came to Shanghai alone. At around 8:00 a.m., he was assassinated in front of No. 48, Puqing Lane, Malan Road, in the French Concession. The French Police reported the body to the Second Special District Court for identification. The deceased's cousin, Zhong Bojie, claimed the body and took it away for burial. After the case occurred, the French Police ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate and arrest the murderer, but it has not been solved to this day. Zhang Asi, a 24-year-old bandit from Suzhou, was arrested last year in the Public Concession for committing gang robbery and possessing firearms. After being interrogated by the First Special District Court, he was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment on April 28th of the same year and sent to the Tilanqiao Prison to serve his sentence. Recently, Zhang confessed in prison that he was also related to the shooting of Du Nanxi. Therefore, the Warden notified the Police, who informed the French Police. The Second Special District Court was requested to prepare a document, and Jin Jiulin, the Inspector General of the Special Agency, dispatched detectives Cai Jinzhang and Zuo Qihong to the First Special District Court the day before yesterday to transfer Zhang Asi to the case. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Second Special District Local Court, where Judge Wang Gangxu of the Criminal Division presided over the trial in the Criminal Court. Gu Shuxi, the Police lawyer, stated the case and requested a postponement of the investigation and then a trial. Zhang Asi confessed that the matter was done by Xiao Wang, who is at large. Before the incident, Xiao Wang borrowed a handgun from me, saying he wanted to kill an enemy. I lent him the handgun. When the incident happened, I also went along and stood at the entrance of the alley, waiting for the matter to be completed, so that I could ask Xiao Wang to return the handgun, to prevent him from discarding it after the incident. Afterwards, at the Xin Xin Hotel, Xiao Wang told me that he, Shi Guisheng, who is at large, and the deceased were selling opium together, which they brought from Sichuan to Shanghai to sell, but it was all embezzled by the deceased, so he wanted to kill him out of anger. He also said that the matter was very simple. I have fully explained the matter to the Police, and there is no need for further investigation. I request to be detained in the detention center during the period of the change for the trial. The court considered that the Police still need to investigate the case in detail and cannot change the detention to the detention center. It was ordered to postpone the trial to July 10th for further investigation. Zhang heard the order and asked the court that if the Police needed to investigate, he requested a shorter period, as he did not want to be detained in the Police Station. The judge then ordered that the period be shortened, and the trial was rescheduled to July 5th. After the order, the defendant was taken back to the Police Station for investigation by the detectives.</p>
<h3>Amid the Scorching Heat of Summer, Shanghai Funeral Parlor Is Busy with Funerals</h3>
<p>The weather in this city has suddenly become hot in recent days, with the hottest day in 60 years. Those with weaker bodies often die from heatstroke. The Shanghai Funeral Parlor on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession is a place dedicated to handling funerals. Recently, the parlor has been exceptionally busy due to the hot weather, almost unable to keep up. At 8:00 a.m. yesterday, Zhu Anlin was encoffined at the parlor. The funeral procedures at the parlor are extremely convenient. Those who entrust the undertaking do not have to lift a finger, and everything is prepared, and the cost is limited. Therefore, those who entrust the funeral to the parlor praise it for its convenience.</p>
<h3>The Case of the "Fishing Ao Guest" Sent Back for Retrial</h3>
<p>Wen Ying, the female disciple of the itinerant fortune-teller "Fishing Ao Guest" (named Cheng Meixian), was killed by her lover, Fan Hongsheng, a few years ago. The Police arrested Fan and sent him to the First Special District Local Court, where he was sentenced to imprisonment. After imprisonment, the deceased's mother, Wang Wu, claimed that her daughter was defiled by Cheng when she followed Cheng to study art, and that Fan's daring to attack with a weapon was also instigated by Cheng. Therefore, she filed a private prosecution against Cheng for interfering with the family. After the initial trial, Cheng was found not guilty. The woman refused to accept the verdict and specially made a vest with characters sewn on it, which she wore all year round, traveling back and forth between Beijing and Shanghai, appealing for justice everywhere. She also appealed to the Second Branch of the Higher Court, requesting that the original verdict be overturned and that Cheng be brought to justice. Subsequently, the first instance resulted in Cheng being found guilty and sentenced to one year of imprisonment. However, Cheng also refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court. After review, the Supreme Court found that the judgment of the second instance was not entirely appropriate. It has now been sent back to the Second Branch of the Higher Court for retrial, in order to prevent any miscarriage of justice and establish credibility. Yesterday morning, Judge Yu summoned both parties for examination. Since there are still witnesses who need to be summoned, he ordered a postponement for further investigation.</p>

He also reported to Gong Xikui, the District Chief of the Fourth District, instructing him to first report the incident to the Supervision Department of the Public Security Bureau by telephone and send the girl who had not yet died to the hospital. However, after examination by the doctor, it was found that the injured girl could not be saved. As neither of the two girls was claimed by their families at the time, Inspector Jiang immediately notified the Railway Police Department by telephone, instructing Zhang Fengqi, the local guarantor of the 23rd district of the department, to report the incident to the Shanghai Local Court for examination.</p>
<h3>Wang Xingyi Doesn't Give His Daughter-in-Law Living Expenses; Each Time She Asks the Court to Enforce; Yesterday the Court Ordered Wang to Be Handed Over</h3>
<p>Wang Wang Yunqu, the daughter-in-law of Suzhou silk merchant Wang Xingyi, because her husband went to Tianjin many years ago, formed a new relationship, abandoning her and the four children she bore him. The father-in-law also did not provide for their support, causing difficulties in the lives of the woman and her children. Therefore, she hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to sue Wang Xingyi in the First Special District Local Court. The judge mediated in court, ordering the defendant to pay 20 yuan per month for living expenses. In addition, the defendant was also responsible for the education, medical expenses, and clothing expenses of the grandchildren. A settlement record was signed to ensure good faith. Wang Xingyi did not pay until his daughter-in-law applied to the court for enforcement each time the payment was due. He was extremely stingy. Yesterday, because he delayed the payment, the court, at the plaintiff's request, sent a bailiff to summon the defendant to the court to investigate. The plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Tingrui, stated that the defendant had never automatically paid the monthly payments and had deliberately failed to fulfill the settlement conditions. The court questioned Wang, but he was evasive. The investigating judge understood that the defendant was not without financial resources and was clearly intentionally disrespecting the settlement record. He ordered him to immediately pay 100 yuan in silver dollars for the needs of the plaintiff and her children. Unexpectedly, Wang still tried to resist the court's order, making excuses and evasions. The court then ordered him to be handed over.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of Zheng Daihe's Solo Exhibition; Starting July 1st at the Old Youth Association</h3>
<p>Zheng Daihe, a painter and calligrapher from Wujin, is well-versed in the national essence of painting and believes that calligraphy and painting are enough to cultivate the mind and enhance intelligence. In the past, he followed the famous painter Wu Guandai from Xishan for many years, researching deeply and gaining more and more achievements. He has long been renowned in the art world and praised in Suzhou and Changzhou. Zheng's landscapes capture the true essence of Wen, Shen, Tang, and Wang, while his figures trace back to Longmian and Liuru. His recent imitations of Ying Piaozi's works also reveal an ancient atmosphere. In particular, his birds, flowers, insects, and scales can move freely between Xinluo and Baiyang. With a wave of his hand, he captures the natural charm and is truly a masterpiece. In the past few years, he has held solo exhibitions in Su, Xi, Jing, Han, and even Wuhu and Changsha, which have been highly praised by celebrities and gentry in various places. This time, he did not hesitate to come to Shanghai in the heat, bringing more than 200 of his carefully crafted masterpieces from the past ten years to hold an exhibition at the Shi Bao Guan, promoting art and elucidating the national essence. His ambitions are commendable. The details have been recorded in this newspaper in the past. Yesterday was the second day of Zheng's painting exhibition. Although it was under the scorching sun, with the Fahrenheit thermometer rising to over 100 degrees, people from all walks of life and lovers of calligraphy and painting still braved the heat to visit. In recent days, the number of guests attending the exhibition has been no less than several hundred thousand. Everyone praised Zheng's works, saying that his accomplishments are profound and different from ordinary people. They lingered and were reluctant to leave. In particular, the tiger painting was miraculously rendered. The old pine and strange rocks are also vigorous and beautiful, taking the ancient method, with green and blue landscapes, breathing in the spirit of the Song people, and closely following the mountains and valleys, Wang Xizhi's fan, snow-covered bamboo, returning herds at sunset, pine forest longevity Buddha, Magu offering wine, and birds and flowers, all have their own unique features. In particular, the Shudao Hanyun Tu handscroll, imitating Wang Qingqing's original, is as long as three zhang, and is even more precious with the inscriptions of famous calligraphers and painters such as Hu Tinglu, Zhang Shijun, Wu Jingyu, Qian Zhenhuang, Yan Ganyuan, Deng Chunshu, Yu Baoqing, and Tang Danran. Zheng's painting exhibition is scheduled to be held at the Sichuan Road Youth Association from July 1st to 3rd. It is easier for visiting guests to travel back and forth. At the same time, July 1st to 3rd is the annual holiday for the Shanghai banking industry.

<p>▲Administering a Prescription is Better than Administering Medicine: Mr. Wu Shuhe, an expert in internal medicine, can be said to spare no effort in popularizing medical knowledge. In addition to enthusiastically teaching Chinese medicine, he has recently felt that folk remedies are the origin of medical and pharmaceutical knowledge, and many of them have miraculous effects. If there is no special book to widely disseminate them, it would be a loss to the purpose of loving the group and helping the public, and the medical community would also have less help in research and improvement. Therefore, for the past few months, Dr. Wu has been posting in newspapers and broadcasting on the radio, striving to solicit folk remedies. His benevolent heart and skillful art are truly admirable. It is said that major philanthropists have come forward to help with miraculous remedies, reaching more than one hundred. They will soon be printed and are scheduled to be published in October. However, the more remedies, the better. If any circles have repeatedly tested and verified remedies, please send them to the Wu Shuhe Chinese Medicine Teaching Office at No. 4 Qudang Lane, Caojiadu, Shanghai, and the title will be included in the book. After publication, a copy of the book will be sent as a gift to promote dissemination.

<h3>Reading Q&amp;A: Mei Lanfang and the Future of Chinese Old Opera | Reply to Mr. Li Ruhui | Reading Guidance:</h3>
<p>After reading Mr. Shiheng's "Mei Lanfang's Performance in Russia" on the Torch of the 17th Dagong Daily, I can't help but have the following questions:</p>
<p>1.  The artistic value of Chinese old opera: In the article, Mr. Shiheng first cited the three reasons why Mr. Jizi opposes old opera (the original text has not been read): 1. The gongs and drums in Peking opera are not music; 2. Cross-dressing belongs to the art of primitive drama and is vulgar and unbearable; 3. Men singing female voices or women singing male voices are unnatural and somewhat comical. Then, he further completely denied the artistic value of old opera, believing that "old opera is an art of a barbaric society, and in any case, it cannot be suitable for modern society." Therefore, he said, "I ask, which person who understands art can tolerate the noise of gongs and drums, the strange laughter and crying?" And then, "Which person who appreciates art can see the red-bearded painted faces, the strange costumes that cannot exist in any era?" Is Chinese old opera really as Mr. Shiheng said, without any artistic value? I don't quite believe it! Not to mention anything else, just its long history and widespread circulation do not allow us to deny it uncritically. The existence of a thing must have its social basis and its own value for existence. I am not a "national essence school" intentionally speaking up for old opera, but I feel that Mr. Shiheng's obliteration of everything cannot convince people, and only exposes his own lack of understanding of drama. For example, opposing classical Chinese cannot deny the artistry of all classical Chinese. Can we say that Lisao, the Book of Songs, and the poems of Li Du have no artistry? Moreover, what standards is Mr. Shiheng using for his so-called "artistic"? This is the first thing I ask you to answer.</p>
<p>2.  Why does the Soviet Union want to invite Mei Lanfang? Regarding the reasons why the Soviet Union wants to invite Mei Lanfang to perform, two points can be seen from the article. One is what the reporter who reported this news quoted, saying that "the whole world has recognized that Chinese drama is full of symbolism, and the Soviet Russian art world is also popularizing symbolism, so they want to appreciate Dr. Mei's art." The other is what Mr. Shiheng himself said, that "Soviet Russia has the spare money to invite Mr. Mei to perform" and "for the sake of novelty." I dare not believe either of these statements: Mr. Shiheng also briefly explained whether Chinese drama is symbolism, but what about the Soviet Union? According to what I have heard, socialist realism is popular, and realism has not only not declined but has also been elevated to a new stage. Why is symbolism popular again? I think it is a pity that Mr. Shiheng did not specifically explain this. As for what Mr. Shiheng said, it is even closer to joking. Even if the Soviet Union has spare money, and even though the Soviet Union spares no effort in cultural construction, it will never blindly and curiously invite Mei Lanfang to "sightsee"? However, what is the reason why the Soviet Union invited Mei Lanfang to perform? This is the second thing I ask you to answer.</p>
<p>3.  The future of Chinese drama: Although the Chinese spoken drama movement has made considerable progress, to be fair, old opera still occupies a very large position in the minds of the public. Not only in rural areas is it completely the power of old opera, but even in large cities, spoken drama and film are only opposed to old opera. Of course, as a whole, old opera should be resolutely opposed, and the decline of old opera is inevitable. However, drama is the most popular art. If we want to create more popular drama, we cannot but pay attention to the subjective and objective conditions that enable old opera to attract a large audience. May I ask, when we are vehemently opposing old opera and building new drama, and when we are deciding on the future of the drama movement, is this not a question that should be specifically raised? This is the third thing I ask you to answer.</p>
<p>The above three points are not only my personal questions, I think they must also be the questions of many drama lovers. I hope you will give us a correct answer as soon as possible. Li Ruhui</p>

<p>Afterwards, Pan Lai gradually gained control of Meng's serve and volley, and won back a set with 6 to 3. The competition in the third set was even more fierce. The strength was equal and it was difficult to separate.

<h3>Bai Hong Departs for Suzhou This Morning ▲ A Group of Thirty-Five, High-Spirited ▲ Bai Hong-Suzhou-Wuxi Competition Kicks Off at Noon</h3>
<p>The Bai Hong Track and Field Team is scheduled to depart for Suzhou at 8:00 AM this morning to compete against local athletes. This time, Bai Hong is mainly composed of its team members, matching the strength of the Suzhou team to increase the interest in the competition. As for Cheng Jinguan, Chen Baoqiu, and others, they will be present for demonstration purposes. The entire team consists of approximately thirty-five people, a strong and well-equipped force, truly a formidable team.</p>
<p>▲ Enthusiastic Welcome: Sports figures from Suzhou will all go to the station to greet them. After getting off the train, they will take a commemorative photo at the station, then proceed as a team to the YMCA dining hall for lunch, followed by a rest at the Xin Su Hotel. In one hour, they will go to the competition venue, with the opening ceremony at 2:30 PM. At 7:30 PM in the evening, Wu Silan, a prominent Suzhou gentleman, will host a banquet for all the athletes.</p>
<p>▲ Accommodation: For lodging, the Xin Su Hotel has been designated, with over twenty rooms already booked, two people per room. This hotel is the best equipped in Suzhou, so there will be no issue with comfort.</p>
<p>▲ Wuxi's Participation: The Liangxi team dispatched by Mr. Xue Xuehai of Wuxi, also led by Zhang Jia , will depart for Suzhou at 7:13 AM today and return to Wuxi on the same day. The entire team consists of fifteen people.</p>
<p>▲ Strengths of Each Team: Bai Hong is naturally the stronger team, but it is a pity that many top athletes, such as Wang Yongmin and Chen Guojun, cannot go. Among them, Chen Baoqiu and Cheng Jinguan are expected to produce excellent records. Suzhou's Lu Yaxiong, who recently broke the 14-meter triple jump record, cannot compete due to an unhealed leg injury. Zhang Jia of Wuxi has recently regained his strength, jumping 6.81 meters in the long jump and 13.97 meters in the triple jump during the preliminaries, and is sure to add a special brilliance to the event.</p>
<p>▲ Bai Hong's Resolutions: Bai Hong staff held an emergency meeting yesterday and resolved three matters: ㈠ If the temperature does not decrease, a temporary proposal will be made to cancel the 3,000-meter long-distance race. ㈡ The logistics department should prepare more heat-relieving medicine and summer hygiene products to prevent emergencies. ㈢ All team members are notified that if they feel unwell, they should not force themselves to depart or compete.</p>

<h3>Joint Graduation Ceremony of Elementary Schools in This City ▲ Speeches by Guests Dong Renjian, etc. ▲ Arithmetic Repêchage Awards Given at the Same Time</h3>
<p>The joint graduation ceremony of the fifth session of municipal and approved private elementary schools in this city was held at the Tianchan Stage on Fuzhou Road yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM.

<h3>Number of Participants</h3>
<p>Including Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau, represented by Chen Bai, Mayor Wu, represented by Hong Da, and Cai Hongtian, representing the Municipal Party Department, etc. There were over 5,000 graduates from senior elementary schools and over 6,000 from junior elementary schools, totaling over 11,000 people. The Tianchan Stage was completely packed from top to bottom. Due to the hot weather yesterday, the Municipal Health Bureau specially dispatched nurses with medical supplies to provide services at the venue.</p>
<h3>Ceremony Details</h3>
<p>The graduation ceremony began at 1:30 PM, with formalities followed. First, Chairman Chen Bai reported, followed by speeches by Secretary Hong, representing the Mayor, and Cai Hongtian, representing the Municipal Party Department.

<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Chairman Chen Bai reported briefly that Director Pan had returned to his hometown due to important matters and was unable to attend the graduation ceremony of the municipal and private elementary schools. There were approximately 5,000 senior elementary school graduates and over 6,000 junior elementary school graduates, totaling over 11,000 people. Most of the senior students participated today, while fewer junior students did. After four or six years, everyone has received much guidance from teachers in academics and character, and has basic knowledge. Everyone must know that the purpose of studying is to learn how to be a person, and elementary school is the preparation for learning how to be a person. Currently, many children in China do not have the opportunity to study and live irregular lives, working as laborers or peddlers, etc. Everyone being able to graduate from elementary school is already the greatest happiness. Everyone should always remember that today is the most glorious day, but everyone is on the road to becoming a person, which is both joyful and requires continued effort to reach the destination. Whether you continue your studies or enter the workforce, you must always remember to be a useful person. During this summer vacation, you should make good use of your time, not waste it, and do your best to help your family and teach those who are illiterate, etc.</p>
<h3>Representatives' Speeches</h3>
<p>The Mayor's representative said briefly that the Mayor was unable to attend due to matters and was represented by his brother. Today's elementary school graduation ceremony is like the groundbreaking ceremony of a building, which is very important. In addition to studying, everyone should be aware of China's current danger, cultivate a strong national spirit, and learn how to be a person, etc. The Municipal Party Department representative Cai Hongtian said briefly that industry is academic or career. After graduating from elementary school, whether you pursue academics or a career, you should know that excellence in industry comes from diligence, and "a young idler, an old beggar," etc.</p>
<h3>Guest Speakers</h3>
<p>Guest Dong Renjian gave a speech, briefly saying, "Everyone's graduation now is truly joyful, but you must understand that there is no end to industry. Graduation is just the end of one place, one passage, one kind of success. We must know that all successes are graduations, all the same joy, all the same envy, all the same praise. Your current graduation can be said to be the first success, but this is just a beginning, a small success. Everything has a beginning, and everything should start small. Great achievements come late, and great careers are waiting for you children to do successfully. Your great successes are in the future. How happy Sun Yat-sen was after overthrowing the Manchu Qing and building the Republic of China, how much he was loved, was his greatest graduation. But the revolution has not yet succeeded, and comrades still need to work hard. Children, you must continue to work hard, follow our wise leader, and do the great cause that Mr. Sun has already started," etc.</p>
<h3>Students' Responses</h3>
<p>㈠ Senior elementary school graduate representative Wan Zhu Li Hede's response: "We are very honored to have you all here at the joint graduation ceremony of elementary schools in the city and to hear your instructions. We are very grateful for the guidance on how to have a regular direction after graduation. We should work harder after graduation and not disappoint the expectations of all the teachers. On behalf of all the senior elementary school graduates in the city, thank you." ㈡ Private school graduate representative Shanghai Elementary School Wang Weihai's response: "Elementary school is the foundation of education, and elementary school graduation is the confirmation of the foundation of education. Under the guidance of teachers in elementary school for six years, we have made considerable progress. We dare not say that the foundation is solid after graduation, like building a ship, sailing in the ocean. All the teachers are the compass, the guiding light for our control of the sea. The country is now in danger, and our responsibility is great. We hope that the teachers will always guide us," etc.</p>

<h3>Shortwave Predictions After Twenty Years</h3>
<p>— Wang Fumin</p>
<p>Thinking back to twenty years ago, when shortwave radio was just becoming practical, most amateur operators were active below 200 meters. Of course, at that time, there was no wireless telephone, and even if there was, it would have been on longwave.</p>
<p>So, what new developments will there be in shortwave radio twenty years from now? You only need to look at the progress in recent years to be amazed. So, in twenty years, the amazing inventions described below will definitely be realized.</p>
<p>First to be mentioned is television. Every radio expert agrees that television cannot be separated from shortwave. In other words, television depends on shortwave for its development, and in the future, it may even develop on ultra-shortwave. ￣</p>
<p>Currently, the largest shortwave radio station only emits 400 kilowatts, which seems relatively small. Undoubtedly, in the future, radio stations will need to increase to over 1,000 kilowatts, and there will definitely be such stations using this large amount of power. Now, let's talk about the only drawback of shortwave, which is fading. In the future, we will definitely be able to find a way to eliminate it. A DX station, for example, 10,000 miles away, can be received as clearly as a local station using a two-tube radio. At that time, there will be no need to be ambitious and build ten-tube or fifteen-tube radios. A one-tube, two-tube, or at most three-tube radio will be enough for you to use a loudspeaker.</p>
<p>In the future, when broadcasting commercial and political affairs, the same program can be broadcast in three or four languages and on the same wavelength. Readers will definitely find this prediction strange, but didn't the Columbia Broadcasting System already broadcast both radio and television on the same wavelength a few years ago? In the future, if someone in a distant place can turn the selector switch on their radio and listen to the language they understand, for example, a British radio station broadcasts English, German, and Spanish at the same time, with four reporters broadcasting the same program. This means that in the future, shortwave will be international.</p>
<p>In the future, mail between Europe and America will be sent by a specially made aircraft in the stratosphere, taking only four to six hours to arrive. The aircraft will not carry passengers, only small packages of mail. The piloting, landing, and departure of the aircraft will all be controlled by shortwave radio, which is what is called radio telemechanics.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there will be radio printing of newspapers. The Radio Corporation of America claims that it has invented a method of directly transmitting telegrams using ultra-high frequency (Facsimile telegram delivery system), which eliminates the clumsy method of dots and dashes and directly transmits text. Therefore, from now on (or perhaps even now), we can send handwritten documents, signatures, etc., to distant places using a facsimile machine.</p>
<p>Radio newspapers (Radio newspaper) use almost the same principle as the facsimile machine, completely automatically, without any human intervention. The machine includes a shortwave radio and uses a clock to control its operation. For example, at 2:00 AM, after receiving a special facsimile signal, a roll of newspaper will start to turn on a stick. At the same time, there is a special mechanical device (containing a compressed air bottle and an ink bottle, both of which are controlled by a modulated electromagnet) that sprays ink like mist. Printing uses a duplex system, so both sides of the newspaper can be printed at the same time. When the signal is received, the paper slowly turns, and a machine, like a typewriter, moves back and forth, roughly several times a minute. Then, the text, photos, etc., are printed on the paper. Half an hour later, the newspaper is completely printed and automatically folded by the radio and placed on a shelf. Tomorrow morning, you can have a newspaper to read. Of course, the newspaper printed at that time will not be as big or as much as the current newspaper, only four or five pages of local news, important declarations, and valuable photos. The price will definitely be very cheap, not exceeding the current price of newspapers.</p>
<h3>Quick Method for Testing Open Circuit of Low Frequency Transformer</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>If there is a malfunction in the radio 丨丨 noise or no sound at all, the first step is to check whether the voltage of each pole of the vacuum tube meets the specified value. The second thing to test is whether the coil of the low-frequency transformer (or speaker) is damaged. According to experience and facts, for damaged radios, the source of the problem is on the low-frequency transformer, accounting for almost 80% to 90%.</p>
<p>Usually, to test a low-frequency transformer, it is generally necessary to disassemble it first. Then use a stethoscope or voltmeter in series with a battery to measure it. This method is not only cumbersome but also very uneconomical in terms of time.</p>
<p>[丨&gt;Output Input&lt;丨]</p>
<p>The figure shows the most common wiring method of a low-frequency transformer in a radio. Whether the transformer is short-circuited or not, testing according to the following steps can save a lot of time.</p>
<p>(1) First, connect the positive terminal of the voltmeter to the plate (P) of the vacuum tube socket, and the negative terminal to the grid (G). (As shown in the figure) If the voltmeter shows no reading at this time, it proves that at least one coil (the secondary coil of T1 and the primary coil of T2) must be damaged.</p>
<p>(2) Next, change the negative terminal of the voltmeter (with the positive terminal still connected to P) to the negative terminal of the filament (F-) of the vacuum tube socket. If the voltmeter (in series with the primary coil of T2 and the B battery) shows no reading at this time, it proves that the primary coil of T2 is damaged.</p>
<p>(3) Finally, change the positive terminal of the voltmeter (with the negative terminal still connected to G) to the positive terminal of the filament (F+) of the vacuum tube socket. If the voltmeter (in series with the secondary coil of T1 and the C battery) shows no reading at this time, it proves that the secondary coil of T1 is damaged.</p>
<p>The primary coil of T1, the secondary coil of T2, and the speaker coil can all be tested using the above method.</p>
<p>During the test, if:</p>
<p>(1) Although the voltmeter has a reading, the pointer is constantly jumping, which is a sign that the coil is about to break. At this time, there will be noise in the speaker.</p>
<p>(2) Although the voltmeter has a reading, its value is not lower than the original B voltage or C voltage, which is because there is a short circuit inside the coil. At this time, there will be no sound in the speaker.</p>
<h3>Radio Can Cure Diseases</h3>
<p>— Zhou Linbao</p>
<p>Marconi is the inventor of radio. Many people know his name. According to recent news from Rome in the Western newspapers, this electrical genius, like Edison, is once again attempting to introduce radio into the medical field. He has invented the principle of using high-frequency shortwave radio to kill microorganisms in the patient's body. It raises the patient's body temperature to a level that is difficult for those microorganisms to survive, and they are all eliminated one by one. Although this method has not yet been tested on patients, if we think about how the mysterious radio was invented, then we can be confident that Marconi will succeed this time by a large margin.</p>
<p>There is also a new invention, an electrical scalpel for surgeons, which has the characteristic that the person undergoing the operation does not bleed. We may be a little doubtful when we hear this news, but it is true. It uses the force transmitted from a generator to immediately seal the blood vessels being cut during the incision, and no more blood flows out.</p>
<p>I want to bless this inventor for the people of the world, but the only hope is that when they are released to the world, they must not be as expensive as X-rays, so that the poor and sick can no longer afford to enjoy them!</p>
<h3>Single-Tube Double-Effect Powerful Radio</h3>
<p>— Liu Tongkang</p>
<p>Recently, single-tube loudspeaker radios have been very active in the radio world. Whether they are amateur or academic research comrades, almost everyone hopes to install one. The biggest advantage is that it is economical, simple, and effective. The radio that I am going to introduce now also meets the above principles.</p>
<p>The circuit of this machine was copied from a certain Western magazine. Because of the lack of materials, it was not possible to assemble it one by one according to the original circuit. I could only complete the machine by cutting corners. However, according to the test results, the performance is very good, similar to the effect of a two-tube machine using a No. 57 vacuum tube as a detector and a No. 56 vacuum tube as a low-frequency amplifier.</p>
<p>When testing at the beginning, the vacuum tube used was a No. 57, but later it was replaced with a No. 89 high-power output tube, and the effect was greatly increased. The volume was much louder than before, and the sound quality was also very clear and gentle.</p>
<p>The author of this machine is currently using it. The B battery is replaced with a substitute B battery, the output voltage is 180 volts, and the A battery is modified with a doorbell transformer, the voltage is 6.3 volts. Every evening, when using a loudspeaker to play music, all the major radio stations in Shanghai are received very clearly. Although the volume is not as good as an ordinary three-tube machine, it is more than enough to be heard in a room. This machine is very sensitive in selection. Under precise adjustment, the Oriental and Sino-Western radio stations, which are only 20 kilohertz apart, can be completely undisturbed. In addition, the reception range is also good, and Central, Japan, and Taipei can all be received.</p>
<p>In short, the effect of this machine is really not bad, and the circuit is simple, and the parts are very economical. General active comrades may wish to try it.</p>
<p>The circuit is shown in the figure: The vacuum tube V in the machine, the author uses No. 89, and others such as No. 57 and No. 77 can also be used, but the effect is worse!</p>
<p>C1 in the machine is a 0.00035 MFD variable capacitor for adjusting the wavelength, C2 is a 0.00025 MFD grid capacitor, C3 and C4 are both 1 MFD bypass capacitors, R1 is a 4 MEG grid leak, R2 is 1000, a fixed resistor, used as a substitute C battery, R3 is 100000, a potentiometer, used to adjust regeneration. T is a 5:1 low-frequency transformer, a 3:5:1 can also be used, and a 0.002 MFD fixed capacitor can be connected between the primary PB. RFC is a high-frequency choke coil to stabilize the oscillation, you can buy it ready-made or make it yourself. For self-made, you can use a temporary diameter tube and wind one or two hundred turns with No. 38 enameled wire.</p>
<p>The coils L1, L2, and L3 in the machine can use ordinary three- or four-way coils. The regeneration coil does not need to be rotated, or use three spider web plates, one winding 10 turns for L1, one winding 72 turns for L2, and one winding 35 turns for L3, all using No. 26 enameled wire. After winding, combine the three spider webs in one place and fix them in the machine. As for the positive and negative of the regeneration coil, it must be determined after testing.</p>
<p>Small Experience</p>
<h3>(1) Utilization of Broken Bakelite Utensils and Records</h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>Broken bakelite utensils and old or broken phonograph records are useless and like waste. They can be used as excellent insulators. Their use, of course, depends on the size and shape of the fragments; but within the possible range, they can also be artificially modified to suit the needs. For example, if you want to cut a large piece of broken bakelite or a record into a suitable small piece, you must first bake it with the flame of an alcohol lamp to soften it, and then cut it with scissors to the desired size and shape. It is also very easy to cut, no different from cutting cardboard. If you want to flatten an originally curved piece of broken bakelite into a flat plate; you must bake it soft with fire, and then gently press it with a wooden board, and it will become a flat bakelite board. The only thing to pay attention to during work is that the fire should not be too fast when baking, so as to avoid burning.</p>
<h3>(2) Self-Made Method of Bakelite Tube</h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>Bakelite tubes are imported and very expensive. They can also be made by yourself for application. Although the finished product is not as neat and beautiful as the purchased one, its function is the same, and it does not cost a penny. There is no difficulty in making it. Take a rectangular piece of broken record that has been cut into shape, bake it with fire to soften it, and then roll it on a round stick to make it round. After it cools and hardens, it is done. This method has a disadvantage, that is, there is a crack at the junction of the two ends; but this crack does not hinder the use.</p>
<h3>(3) Lightning Arrester</h3>
<p>— Wu Shanzhang</p>
<p>In summer, radios are always subjected to various threats, the most serious of which is high-voltage lightning in the sky. Therefore, those who have radios must install a lightning arrester. The price of those sold in ordinary electrical shops is always around one yuan, at least six or seven cents, and most of them are knife switches, and it is dangerous to forget to switch them off, which is very troublesome.</p>
<p>If we can pay a little attention, the materials for lightning arresters are everywhere, and the production is also very simple. Use two pieces of broken saw teeth, make their tips face each other, the closer the better, but not touching. One piece is connected to the antenna, then to the radio antenna post, and the other piece is connected to the ground wire, then to the ground wire post. Then, during thunderstorms, high-voltage static electricity in the sky will jump into the ground wire from the saw tooth tip, and the radio will not be damaged.</p>
<p>Similarly, carbon rods from small round batteries can be sharpened and placed opposite each other, and used pencil tips can be sharpened and placed opposite each other. However, pencils transmit electricity poorly.</p>
<h3>(4) Substitute for Ground Wire Clip</h3>
<p>— Wu Shanzhang</p>
<p>Those who live in Shanghai and have radios usually connect the ground wire to the tap water pipe because it is convenient and effective.</p>
<p>The substitute for the ground wire clip mentioned here is made of a folder. We connect the leather wire to the handle of the folder, and then clip the clip to the tap water switch. (You can't clip the pipe because the pipe is too thick)</p>
<p>Such a ground wire clip is very cheap.</p>
<p>[Ｐ&gt;(5) Most Economical Key&lt;Ｐ]</p>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>The cheapest key (Key) sold on the market also costs about two or three yuan. The one introduced in this article only costs a few cents to make.</p>
<p>Take a large wooden clothespin and screw it onto a wooden board, then install two screws on the tail end. (See attached figures A and B) When using, press the button. If you want to change the distance of the contact point, you can adjust the nut of screw A.</p>

<h3>Domestic and Foreign News</h3>
<p>▲Recent News from the Mainland Telecommunications Tutoring School: Recently, a Mainland Telecommunications Tutoring School was opened at No. 319, 3rd Floor, Mainland Commercial Building, Nanjing Road. It was founded by several faculty members of the National Jiaotong University. It is quite large in scale, and the courses offered include (1) Elementary Wireless Engineering, (2) Advanced Wireless Engineering, (3) Radio Engineering, (4) Wireless Transmitting and Receiving, (5) Electrical Engineering, (6) Telephony, (7) Wired Telegraphy, and other courses totaling more than ten. Students can choose to study whatever they want. It is said that registration starts today, and classes start on July 14th. Those who are interested in studying wireless electricity can register at the school. It is also said that the school also has correspondence courses in wireless and wired electricity, and free enrollment starts today. Simple materials are available for free.</p>
<p>▲Special News from Yada Company: The radio repair department of Yada Company at No. 24 Nanjing Road has been increasingly busy recently. All the parts needed for the company's repairs are ordered directly from the United States, so the equipment is sufficient and the cost is low, providing customers with unparalleled convenience. Taking capacitors as an example, the company's manager, Aeroyox, is the best capacitor on the market. Therefore, no matter how poor the performance of the radio is, once it is repaired by the company, it will make a clear and distinct sound. The company not only has superb skills, but also uses top-quality materials, which doubles the performance.</p>
<p>▲Large Price Reduction on Stewart Radios: Various Stewart radios produced by the famous Stewart factory in Chicago, USA, are now on sale at a large discount in the summer. The selling price is very low, which is very suitable for listening to the radio in the summer. It is truly a rare opportunity, so there are many people going to various stores to buy them these days. The main store at the eastern end of Hongmiao on Nanjing Road has specially installed a new type of polar air conditioning device to treat customers well. The company has recently received various parts and Salmen vacuum tubes, which are the best on the market, but there is not much stock, so buyers should hurry.</p>
<p>▲The Great Shanghai Wireless Electric Company at No. 49 Nanjing Road is familiar with all kinds of wireless radios after they have been repaired, such as the construction, circuits, and parts used in Eagle King, Arcy, Stewart, and the latest brands of radios. Therefore, the company does not have to guess when repairing radios, but can proceed in a logical and orderly manner. Therefore, it can achieve good results and is trusted by Wheeler Company, which entrusts all its unrestored radios to the company for repair, which is no accident.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Records of Imperial Incense in Misty Vapors</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In the North, this dish has another name, called "Ringing Bell"; it is meant to describe how crisp it is, so crisp that people can chew out sounds. Therefore, this dish is always made as loose and crisp as possible, and the elderly can only sigh at it because of their incomplete teeth.</p>
<p>In the Empress Dowager's later years, cherry meat took the place of "Ringing Bell" and became the Empress Dowager's particularly favorite dish. The method of making it is to first cut high-quality pork into small pieces the size of chess pieces, add seasonings, and then mix it with fresh cherries, 丨丨 when there are no fresh cherries, put cherries that have already been candied or made by other methods in warm water to soak them, soaking them until they are as beautiful and tender as fresh ones. 丨丨 Together they are placed in a white porcelain jar, add some clear water, and let it simmer slowly over a low fire; after about ten hours, the meat is crispy, and the aroma of the cherries is also cooked out, so that greedy people can eat their fill at will. Especially the soup, it's really extremely delicious!</p>
<p>Among the several kinds of vegetables that are often eaten in the palace, the Empress Dowager liked "peas" the most. Peas are always picked when they are very tender, so not only is its taste very refreshing, but seeing its color, like green beads piled in a white porcelain bowl, it is also easy to arouse your appetite. Radishes were originally not qualified to be mixed into the imperial cuisine, because people in the palace have always been very dismissive of it, thinking that it is only food for the common people, or even used to feed livestock, and must never be used to desecrate the Empress Dowager; later, I don't know how, the Empress Dowager thought of it herself, and she ordered the eunuch in charge of the imperial kitchen to get some to try. Fortunately, those chefs were really smart, and with great difficulty, they managed to squeeze out all the original smell of the radish; then they paired it with ham soup or rich chicken and duck soup, and the taste would certainly not be bad!</p>
<h3>The Legend of Suzhou's Xuanmiao Temple</h3>
<p>— Nan Gong Sheng</p>
<p>When Suzhou's "Xuanmiao Temple" is mentioned, everyone knows it's a famous place in Suzhou. In reality, it's just like the City God Temple in Shanghai, a small general merchandise market. However, there are particularly many legends about the "Xuanmiao" Temple, the most famous being about the "Sanqing Hall," the "Wordless Stele," and the "Large Water Basin."</p>
<p>The "Sanqing Hall" is a large hall in the center of the "Xuanmiao Temple," where the true Three Pure Ones are enshrined: Lao Tzu, the Primordial Celestial Venerable, and the Master of the Heavens. The three statues are over ten zhang tall, their heads touching the roof beams, and their lotus pedestals are built directly on the ground, making them truly magnificent. The legends about the "Sanqing Hall" revolve around these three statues. It is said that in the beginning, there were only two statues in the "Sanqing Hall." The addition of the third statue was due to a spring eye located beneath its base. This spring eye was said to connect to the Eastern Seas. Therefore, the third statue was erected to rely on the spiritual power of the Three Pure Ones to鎮住 suppress the spring eye, otherwise, the entire city of Suzhou would be baptized by seawater. Hence, there is a saying, "If the Three Pure Buddhas fall, Suzhou City is done." Whether this is true or not is unknown since the Three Pure Buddhas have never fallen.</p>
<p>The "Wordless Stele" was erected by Liu Bowen to鎮住 suppress the feng shui of Suzhou City. Because the terrain of Taihu Lake is much higher than that of Suzhou City, without this "Wordless Stele," the water from Taihu Lake would flood the city, and the people of Suzhou would become fish and turtles. Due to this legend, the "Wordless Stele" still stands behind the "Sanqing Hall" and to the side of "Zhongshan Hall," and no one dares to touch it.</p>
<p>The "Large Water Basin" is also behind the "Sanqing Hall." It is said that there are two spring eyes in the "Xuanmiao Temple," one under the base of the Three Pure Buddhas and the other in the "Large Water Basin." Therefore, regardless of drought or flood, winter or summer, the water in the "Large Water Basin" has never dried up, which is solid proof of the spring eye connection. However, if you go to the "Xuanmiao Temple" now, you can see that the "Large Water Basin" is completely filled with bricks and earth, and there is no trace of any clear spring water. This legend has clearly become a thing of the past. As for the "Sanqing Hall" and the "Wordless Stele," one is because the statues are too tall and no one can move them, and the other is because the implications are too great and no one dares to try. Whether they conform to the legends is unknown.</p>
<h3>Brain Surgery</h3>
<p>— Luo Nu Xia</p>
<p>The other day, our international news reported: "Leningrad" Surgical Academy successfully performed a brain transplant. It is said: '::: A pigeon-egg-sized adenoma was removed from the brain of a young woman, because if the tumor grew larger, it would cause her to go blind. The location of the tumor was several millimeters from the central nerve. The surgeon, relying on his lifelong skills, was able to move the brain aside and remove the adenoma. This can be considered a groundbreaking event in the medical world," etc. In fact, the success of brain surgery did not begin today. Chinese novels have long recorded that during the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, the scholar Qi Zhaonan broke his brain, and a doctor used horse brain to repair it for him. Although he did not die, he lost his intelligence and forgot everything he had previously read. This is one case.</p>
<p>I heard that twenty years ago in San Francisco, a young woman named "Jane Napa" committed theft and was arrested by the police. Her father was a wealthy businessman who bailed her out. Presumably, she suffered from a mental illness; otherwise, why would she be so muddled? He hired a famous doctor to treat her. After an examination, the doctor said: she damaged her brain in childhood, so rotten bones grew inside, hindering her original conscience, which is why she did things regardless of the consequences. Later, after the doctor dissected and repaired it, within ten days, the evil roots were removed. That is another case.</p>
<p>Combining these two cases with the so-called successful brain transplant now, one can only say that they "mutually complement each other."</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Thirty-One: Three Clashes in the Snow Formation with White Clothes - The Entire Battalion Sacrifices Itself - Red Eyes Enter the Gun Forest</p>
<p>But no matter how low it flew, it was impossible to quickly detect a company of people dressed in white clothes and hats, hiding in the snowy mountain gullies. Therefore, the plane flew back and forth three or four times, and the observers above mistook the troops for white snow, thinking there was nothing to pay attention to, and did not drop any bombs, but went away. However, it brought bombs and could not possibly take them back. From afar, a few loud bangs could be heard, indicating that the bombs had been dropped on the fort. Ziqiang lay prone in the snow, quietly waiting for the sound of the plane to disappear completely, before standing up. Waiting for the troops to stand up, he tugged at his collar twice and said sternly to Brother Bei: "We soldiers should not be afraid of death. Don't misunderstand my caution, thinking that the company commander is scared. You need to know that we are out here today on orders, and there is still a bigger thing to do later. We must not be afraid, we will hold back and not be afraid later. Now, I can tell the brothers what we are going to do. Our battalion commander is an old veteran. His military skills are excellent. Yesterday, he knew that the enemy had very few soldiers and could not possibly attack the fort, so he deliberately loosened the defense line here. Today, the enemy will most likely come this way. When they come, don't panic. If I don't give the order, none of you are allowed to fire a single bullet. When I tell you to kill the enemy, you must rush out with all your might. If we kill one enemy, we will have gotten our money's worth, and if we kill two, we will make a profit. If we kill them tonight, the reinforcements from the pass can arrive tomorrow. Look, if we catch them off guard tonight, wouldn't that be free money?" The brothers didn't understand anything, but when the company commander said they could get free money, everyone bravely waited for the opportunity to get this free money. At this time, the sun was setting further and further, and the cold air in the mountain valley was chilling to the bone. The body had to be taken care of. (422)</p>

<h3>The Shad of Fuchun and the Pine of Huangshan</h3>
<p>— Da Kuai</p>
<p>People only admire the perch of Songjiang but rarely mention the shad of Fuchun. Only the "Remnants of Wulin Affairs" once recorded: "Every year in May, the shad fish on the Fuchun River are at their peak. The Huizhou people catch them and transport them hundreds of miles to the cities in a short time. Some say that this fish comes from the Han River and is not produced in Fuchun. Neither the upper nor the lower reaches of Fuchun have this fish except in summer, which people find strange." In fact, early summer is the spawning season of the shad, which come with the spring tides, and they become the delicacies of the Seven Mile Rapids. The Huizhou people passing through here never fail to enjoy a feast.</p>
<p>The fish is flat and long, the larger ones being over three chi long, with white color like silver, high in fat, and very delicious. However, the flesh has many fine bones and dies soon after leaving the water, and the taste diminishes when dead. Therefore, one must taste it on the boat. The boatmen of Huizhou are skilled at cooking this fish. Now that the automobile road is open, this flavor will probably be difficult to obtain. After a few more years, "eating shad in the Seven Mile Rapids" will probably become a story in the mouths of the elders.</p>
<p>With the opening of the Huizhou-Hangzhou Road, more and more people are traveling on Huangshan Mountain. The products of the mountain are favored by the elegant literati and reclusive scholars, which is very fortunate. Among the eastern tourists, the pine is the most popular. Between rattan boxes and walking sticks, there are verdant, delicate and small pines, all freshly uprooted from the mountains and brought to the human world. If the mountain spirit knows, how can it not be stingy?</p>
<p>In fact, the best pines are mostly on steep cliffs, making them extremely difficult to obtain. The next best are those growing on rocks, and the worst are those growing in mud. Most of what is sold are middle and lower grades. Some are artificially bent to make them crooked, which not only loses their natural appearance but also does not last long. The best pine needles are short, dense, and sharp (prickly), while ordinary leaves are double-stranded. It is said that there are three-stranded and five-stranded ones between Tian Du and Lianhua, but they are not easy to obtain.</p>
<p>To plant pines, one must use yellow mud and place them in a sunny place. Dryness is not a problem, but dampness is most avoided. During each metabolic period, the yellow leaves must be pruned to prevent them from falling off naturally. If they fall off naturally, the new growth will be... and the green and brown colors will be mixed, which is not aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<h3>The Real Old Shanghai and Its Artists</h3>
<p>— Shanghai Tongshe</p>
<p>"Controlling the rivers and gathering merchants from Huai and Zhejiang; connecting to the sea and facilitating transportation from Fujian and Chu; ::::: gathering people of different races in the city; trading goods from the southeast :::::"</p>
<p>The above quotations are two lines from the "Qinglong Town Ode" by the Song Dynasty poet Ying Xi. Even if the words of the ancients were exaggerated, let's discount it by half, and it is still 50% accurate. Then, this Qinglong Town seems to be quite extraordinary. But what exactly is Qinglong Town?</p>
<p>As it turns out, this Qinglong Town was actually old Shanghai.</p>
<p>Legend has it that Sun Quan of Wu once built Qinglong warships there, hence the name Qinglong. It was first established as a town in the fifth year of Tianbao in the Tang Dynasty (746). In the Song Dynasty, it belonged to Huating County. In the Yuan Dynasty, after Shanghai was established as a county, it was divided and belonged to Shanghai. In the Ming Dynasty, it belonged to Qingpu.</p>
<p>The local chronicles tell me the rough outline of this old Shanghai, and especially point out:</p>
<p>":::In the Song Dynasty, the town was a hub for seagoing ships, with three pavilions, seven pagodas, and thirteen temples, and ten thousand families with smoke, and people called it Little Hangzhou."</p>
<p>Old Shanghai also had the beautiful name of Little Hangzhou. It seems that although it did not have the momentary fame of the current Shanghai, which has earned the honor of "Paris of the East," there is no doubt that the Qinglong Town of old Shanghai was prosperous a thousand years ago.</p>
<p>It is said that there was a man from Qinglong Town named Li Jia, with the alias Jingyuan, who was skilled in painting and wrote good poetry and lyrics, and was praised by Su Dongpo. Dongpo once inscribed a poem on Li's magpie painting:</p>
<p>"I heard of the immortal Guo Zhongshu, whose drunken brushstrokes were magnificent. Where are the people who have been lonely for a hundred years? Only Li Jingyuan of Huating remains."</p>
<p>There was also a man named Li Wu regret, with the alias Xingzhong, who was not originally from Qinglong Town but lived in Qinglong Town. He lived a leisurely life, devoted himself to poetry and wine, and built an elegant garden. He did not hold office or receive stipends, but he was highly respected by the famous officials of that time. Su Dongpo inscribed the name "Drunken Sleep" on a pavilion in his garden and wrote a poem to him. Su Ziyou, Qin Shaoyou, Zhang Ziye, and others echoed with rhymes.</p>
<p>Mei Shengyu, a famous poet, often traveled to Qinglong Town. In addition to the "Qinglong Miscellaneous Records," he also wrote a poem "Watching the Tide on the Qinglong River," which reads in part:</p>
<p>"A hundred rivers converge, the water seems to stand upright, soon turning back as if sucked in by the nose. Old fish have no guard and go up and down, crying sadly towards the misty continent. ::: After years of nourishing a fatty body, it suddenly becomes food for the fishermen. Who can rely on the merciless water, which will easily sink them. :::"</p>
<p>The Qinglong River has long been buried, and the river tide is no longer seen. Now, the people of Shanghai have to go to Haining to watch the tide. We never imagined that we could discover the greatness of the ancient Qinglong River tide in the laments of this old poet.</p>
<p>There was also an official named Mi Fu, with the alias Yuanzhang, who served in Qinglong Town. Everyone knows that Mr. Mi's calligraphy and painting were admired by people of that time, now, and in the future. He left two valuable items in the old Shanghai area:</p>
<p>1. Record of the Sutra Collection of Longping Temple (calligraphy)</p>
<p>2. Picture of Shanghai South Scenery (painting)</p>
<p>These artists became the group of artists of old Shanghai in the local chronicles.</p>

<h3>Financial Reaction Intensifies and Rises Again - Gold Market Rebounds Two and a Half Dollars - Conflicting Views on the US Ban on Silver Exports - Initially Weak, the Result is Remarkably Strong</h3>
<p>The gold market did indeed start to rebound yesterday. Initially, the silver price and exchange rate continued to rise, then fell. However, due to tight domestic盘 internal demand and the trend of settlement, the demand exceeded supply in the market, and it gradually rose again. Although there were setbacks in the middle, the result was extremely firm. Early in the morning, overseas silver prices rose consistently in the UK and the US, with the five-metal exchange's forward silver price rising by 3 to 5厘 li (a unit of currency). The price of London refined gold fell by 3 and a half pence, and the exchange rate also rose sharply. US cotton rose by 10 points, and US wheat rose by 1/2.125 points. Stock prices rose generally. In the off-market preparation trading, it immediately fell to 75.6 yuan, but people continued to react, gradually pulling it up. After the opening, the exchange market hardened, and the rise was relatively weak. After entering, the banks' appetite for bidding increased, and the exchange market tightened. It was heard that British and American tobacco companies were also settling accounts. People seemed to be firming up, and large investors frequently bought at low prices. The market stabilized. It was anticipated that HSBC's listing would be flat for British currency and only rise by 125 points for US currency. Buyers were still enthusiastic, and it broke through the 80 yuan mark. At this time, it struggled slightly around 80 yuan, but due to tight domestic盘 internal demand, it eventually rose higher. Reuters电传 telex reported that US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, with the President's permission, had banned silver exports. At the same time, the Associated Press also had the same news, but there were still several regulations that were not subject to the ban. People suddenly thought that the government was implementing its silver purchase policy to avoid manipulation by speculators and achieve the purpose of purchasing silver. Selling pressure rose, and it fell once, but because the news still had room for activity, and because silver was banned from export, it lacked liquidity. Except for the government and the industrial sector, there would probably not be many large buyers, and it was difficult to expect a sharp rise. Therefore, the general mentality was to buy in, and it rose again to above 80 yuan. The New York silver price reported no change overnight, shrinking 125 and 25 points. At this time, it hovered quite flat. Later, as the banks continued to bid, large investors' buying intentions were very strong, and it rose again. However, it was flat at noon. In the afternoon, the New York silver price shrank 125.125 overnight and did not move, and the rise was stable. Reuters电报 reported that, according to the New York Times' comments on the silver ban, the Treasury Department was unwilling to pay more than 50 pounds for purchasing silver domestically. Meng买 Bombay reported a rise of 11 pounds. After that, it went downstream once, but the result was remarkably strong. The price of pure gold was 986 yuan. Now, I will record the market situation for the day,</p>

Yuqingyong entered and exited again, and it fell to 77 yuan and a half. Sanjing扒 ate the October US dollar at 625 points. Fuxingyong disposed of it. At this time, there were many declines, and the situation hovered. Dachangxiang then entered, while Yuan Maoyong entered and exited from time to time. The market was mediocre, and the market head was also small. The New York silver price reported no change overnight, which made people feel calm. Later, Dadecheng once entered at 1 yuan and 6 jiao. The goods were supplied and still frustrated. Dadecheng Dingkang Hengxing came to enter. The banks' appetite for bidding continued, and it rose two and a half yuan. Yuqingyong and the goods were slightly sold, and it retreated to 1 yuan and 2 jiao. Yuan Yishang entered the market and entered, and Yuqingyong also bought, and it rose by 2 yuan and 8 jiao.

In an instant, it retreated to 2 yuan and 7, but because the bank still needed a half yuan for the October US dollar, Hengyu Dade Tongchun Shunmao all entered and once rose to 4 and a half yuan. Under the supply of Cuitai, etc., it retreated to 3 yuan and 6 jiao. Fuxingyong Wanxing Qingyu Dadecheng, etc. were excited to buy, and it rose again to 5 yuan.

<h3>Silver Prices and Exchange Rates Rise - Exchange Market Tightens After Relaxing - ▲Many Settlements Before the Bank's Closing▲</h3>

<h3>Settlement Period Busyness and Resolution of Disputes ▲ Foreign Exchange Remains Steady and Lacks Strength</h3>
<p>The end of the first half of the year settlement period has only one day left today, so yesterday's collections and settlements were even busier. In the market, the foreign exchange rate in the morning and afternoon remained at 6%, unchanged for half a month. The main reasons for this are that the internal disturbances in the mainland have not been quelled and cash is concentrated in Shanghai. In addition, at the end of this half-year, a general conclusion must be made, and expenses are scarce. The demand for funds has increased slightly compared to the previous day, with an increase of two points. The trading of foreign exchange bills was generally similar. The morning session saw over 4.7 million in transfers and new transactions, over 200,000 in the afternoon session, over 300,000 in the small general exchange, over 900,000 in foreign mortgage redemption transactions, and over 800,000 in new transactions. Bank collections and settlements have greatly progressed due to the settlement period. Foreign banks collected over 5.0 million in bills, settled over 5.0 million, transferred over 900,000 by telegraph, and collected over 6.3 million in various goods, drafts, and mortgages, with 800,000 going into storage. Chinese banks collected over 6.0 million in bills, settled over 4.8 million, transferred over 400,000 by telegraph, and collected over 4.9 million in various goods, drafts, mortgages, and miscellaneous items, with over 800,000 in customs duties and 500,000 going out of storage. Japanese banks collected over 4.1 million in bills, collected over 7.1 million in various goods, drafts, mortgages, and miscellaneous items, settled over 4.5 million, and released 600,000 from storage. Qianzhuang collected over 56.0 million in foreign eight singles, over 1.4 million in foreign loan withdrawals, over 700,000 in various remittances, over 300,000 in cash collections, returned and issued a total of over 1.9 million in banknotes, received 200,000 from guest routes, and remitted 500,000.</p>
<p>Also, the total amount exchanged at the city's clearing house on the 29th was 9,015,639.42 silver dollars, including 5,456,991.91 silver dollars and 3,558,647.51 silver dollars in remittances.</p>
<h3>Jiangjiao Initially Rises Then Falls ▲Guangjiao Slightly Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small foreign silver opened at 823.2 yuan in the morning session, an improvement of 3.2 yuan compared to the previous market. However, due to sluggish trading, it returned to the original position of 820 yuan at the close of the afternoon session. As a result, there was no change. The trading volume was 4,000 jiao in the morning session and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Guangdong small foreign silver remained unchanged at 730 yuan in the morning session and slightly declined by 7 jiao to 729.3 yuan in the afternoon session. As a result, it was down by 7 jiao compared to the previous market. The trading volume was 70,000 jiao in the morning session and 25,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Copper coins remained the same as the previous day at 333,000 wen, with a trading price of 11,500 foreign dollars, equivalent to 38,295 strings of wen.</p>
<h3>Securities, the 23rd Customs Bonds Skyrocket Upon Entering the Market, Soaring Four Yuan Before Trading Halted, August Futures Have Already Started Trading, Market Seems Unlikely to Fall Easily</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the public securities exchange, August futures were launched, and current period goods of the 23rd year Customs Bonds were added to the auction. These bonds have a total value of 100 million and will be fully repaid by the 29th year, with an annual interest rate of 6%. Due to their very short maturity, buyers in the market competed to buy them. Because these bonds have never been circulated in the market, short sellers feared a repeat of last year's intense gold short squeeze and did not dare to sell them. Although the Ministry of Finance limited the price to 75 yuan, the market</p>
<p>opened at 78 yuan and then soared rapidly, rising 4 yuan and being suspended from trading at the high price of 82 yuan. Therefore, the initial trend in the first session was slightly small, then stable, and gradually appreciating. Gold shorts surged five to six jiao, and the 23rd Customs Bonds, following the 22nd Customs Bonds, soared and trading was halted. The excellent situation has not been seen in nearly two years. The market price in the second session was consistently three, four jiao to eight and a half jiao higher than in Shanghai. Although August futures were launched for the first day, they also opened consistently. In the afternoon, the opening was slightly lower by one or two jiao, and the 20th year bonds stabilized and turned better, then returned to a high of one or two jiao to half a yuan. Before the close, the front series was down two or three jiao, and gold shorts were slightly better by one or two jiao, which can be called stable. As a result, the market price rose three, four jiao to seven and a half jiao, and the trend was excellent. It is not easy to fall back in the short term. The total transaction volume was estimated to be over 20 million. The rise and fall situation is listed below: (unit: yuan)</p>

<h3>Although Current Sales of Yarn and Flower are Clear, Marked Yarn Rises Instead丨Due to Rumors of Bullish Companies in the Market丨</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon. The situation was extremely chaotic. The rise and fall are now</p>
<p>volatile. The previous market fell due to quiet actual demand and stagnant customer sales, resulting in a lack of buyers. However, the large bullish holders did not release their holdings. In the afternoon, it was heard that the government was strictly prohibiting the export of silver, and there was also talk of inflation. At the same time, two major holders were buying, organizing a bullish company. The market then surged and rose.</p>
<h3>Gold Rooster Rises One Yuan</h3>
<p>In the marked yarn morning market, there was still a lack of buyers. By the second and third rounds of bidding, it was heard that customer sales were sluggish, leading to a decline in sentiment. And the recent downward trend has been more severe. As a result, near-term fell by 1.2-3 yuan, and far-term fell by 5-7-9 jiao. In the afternoon opening, it rose by 5-6 jiao. By the second and third rounds of bidding, the upward trend intensified again. Upon investigation, the market</p>
<p>rumors said that the government was considering imposing taxes on the prohibition of silver export, so the buying wind rose again, and the situation suddenly tightened, with each item improving by more than one yuan. It is said that part of the investigation showed that three cotton merchants were again bullish. Given today is the settlement period, and there are two days of market closure tomorrow, small investors have no courage to hold overnight, and squeeze plays are in the majority. However, by the closing, the far-term slightly weakened. As a result, the near-term rose by 2.5-7 yuan, and the far-term rose by 1.6-7 yuan. The total daily transaction was estimated at 65,300 bales. Investigation found that Changfeng sold 1,450 bales, Changyu 1,250 bales, Yuanda 800 bales, Dafu 1,000 bales, Gengfeng 950 bales, Shenchang 1,650 bales, Xiesheng 800 bales, Xincheng 1,900 bales, and Mingde 800 bales; Hengyi bought 1,400 bales, Huikang 2,600 bales, Xiesheng 1,000 bales, Changfeng 2,950 bales, Dafeng 700 bales, Hengde 1,450 bales, and Taichang 700 bales.

<p>Northern Group 20 Xiamen 7 Shantou 50 Ningbo 7</p>
<h3>Futures Cotton Rises, Chen Drops</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially rose and then fell. The downward trend in the previous market intensified, with bullish companies releasing large amounts of settlement. The July and August contracts broke through the 7 yuan mark. The downward trend in new cotton was also sharp. According to some news, Hanbu has received heavy rain, causing people to become suddenly nervous, and the selling wind was fierce. In the afternoon, the yarn market surged, and the cotton market also rose sharply.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Rises and Falls Again</h3>
<p>The opening of the marked flower market in the previous session was flat, but foreign cotton rose slightly. However, bullish companies released</p>
<p>settlements, and prices fell sharply in the second and third rounds of bidding. The closing price also fell. It was heard that there was rainfall in Hanbu for new cotton. As a result, each month fell by 5-6 jiao to 2.3 yuan. In the afternoon opening, Yuanyihao sold in large quantities, falling by 1 jiao. By the second and third rounds of bidding, the yarn market rose, and there was news that was beneficial to the bulls. The market sentiment suddenly tightened, and each month rose by 3-4 jiao. The total daily transaction was estimated at 180,900 dan. Investigation found that Yuanyi sold 13,000 dan, Mingde 2,800 dan, Yuanda 2,000 dan, Dafu 2,500 dan, Yukang 3,000 dan, Huikang 2,500 dan, Taichang 2,300 dan, Changfeng 3,900 dan, Dachang 3,100 dan, Xiesheng 2,900 dan, Yuanxingchang 7,400 dan, Chunji 6,100 dan, and Xinheng 2,900 dan; Xincheng bought 4,500 dan, Tongji 3,500 dan, Jifeng 2,800 dan, Dafeng 7,700 dan, Suilong 3,600 dan, Yuanda 3,300 dan, Yuanda 4,300 dan, Shenji 3,200 dan, Yichang 2,700 dan, Changhe 3,000 dan, and Hengyi 1,500 dan.

<h3>Lack of Sellers, US Cotton Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was firm due to the drought in Texas, strong Wall Street support, and a lack of sellers. As a result, the spot price rose by 10 pounds per tone, and the futures price rose by 10-13 pounds per tone. British cotton futures rose by 1 point. Indian cotton was initially weak due to profit-taking by the bulls, but later slightly recovered due to short covering. Speculators and European exporters bought the July and August contracts and sold the next year's April and May contracts. As a result, Pingjiaer fell by 1.5 rupees, and Aomula and Bailuoxi fell by 1.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 28th):</p>

<h3>Flour Market Experiences Sharp Advance and Rapid Retreat ▲Hard to Reduce the Power of Wild Price Increases Before Receiving Rainfall▲</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, the markets for each month presented a once strong, then suddenly plummeted phenomenon. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago recovered 4, 5, 6, 7 jiao, and Canada recovered 3 jiao and some odd change. Therefore, after the opening price, the opening price for this month was raised to 2 yuan and 2 jiao. However, after this extreme peak, it plummeted step by step. The initial lifting of this month was very strong due to the squeeze. Suddenly, it was rumored that the manufacturers would have to deliver goods, and people's hearts were frustrated. By the closing, the price had fallen as low as 1 jiao and a half, a difference of as much as 5 cents. The markets for longer-term months were also greatly relaxed because a certain bank was selling out the bulls and Gaofeng and others were selling. Compared with the previous day's peak, it fell by 4-5 cents. Until the afternoon opening, it was still stable at first, but then it rebounded because more and more outside bulls gathered. All the brokers in the local speculative market had transactions. Therefore, after the initial relaxation, it rebounded again. Moreover, the weather is still arid, and the hearts of outsiders still feel that it is not easy to soften. The situation afterwards must get sufficient rainfall to avoid the crazy price increases of those in the middle. As a result, this month improved by 2.5 li, July remained down by 1.25 li, August and September were down by 1.25 li, October was down by 1 li, and November was down by 1.25 li.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Majors Buy One Hundred Cars</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after the opening in the morning, each month generally presented a phenomenon of initial flatness followed by stability. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat was better by 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 jiao, etc., the continued increase in the market for several days was too unrealistic. Therefore, people in the industry have been watching and not moving forward. Moreover, the price of wheat in the interior has shown a trend of easing, so the opening prices for each month were slightly lower by 1-2 cents. Until the opening in the afternoon, each month had fallen by 3-4 cents because the flour futures turned down. However, after this, major speculators made aggressive purchases, totaling one hundred cars. It is said that this buyer has contact with speculators in the flour market. Therefore, it has aroused the attention of people inside and outside the industry, and the market has seen a sharp rebound. As a result, July ultimately fell by 2, August rose by 2 cents, September rose by 4 cents, October rose by 3 cents, November fell by 1 cent. The current wheat market is temporarily trending sideways. Although the factory appetite is good, all goods are seeking higher grades, so the price is also high and low. It is heard that Xuzhou wheat is 3.12 yuan, Yaowan wheat is 3.10 yuan, Mingguang wheat is 3.10 yuan and some odd 8 points, Shuangfeng wheat is 2.94 yuan, and some odd 9 jiao, Kunshan wheat is 2.96 yuan, Chongming wheat is 2.96 yuan, Hengjing wheat is 3.03 yuan, Suzhou wheat is 3.10 yuan, Wuhu wheat is 2.98 yuan and some odd 9 jiao, Yangzhou wheat is 2.98 yuan, Hankou wheat is 2.92 yuan, Gaoyou wheat is 3.10 yuan, from Fuxin to 9,000 bags, Fufeng to 8,000 bags, and Xinda to 3,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Arrival of More River Rice Market Turns Soft</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various parties turned stronger, totaling thirty-three for late rice, thick japonica, and various colors (totaling over 9,000 bags). Although the market situation is still struggling in the process of drought, it finally succumbed due to the influx of goods, and people's hearts are inevitably more depressed. For example, customers from the Beiyang Tianjin and other groups had a weak intention, and their thinking was uncertain, all presenting a wait-and-see attitude. Because of this, there was very little movement, only 3zai of Qingzhou and other late rice were handled, about 4-500 bags, and the price fell by 1 jiao and a half. Since the thick japonica shops of various groups had a balanced appetite and people's hearts were uncertain, the overall situation felt very scattered. The market conditions for goods from Su Tong, Nan Gang and other places all saw a decline of 2 jiao. Judging from the trend, the large increases were followed by small declines. Du Jianzi suddenly stood out with a surprising appetite, and its market form uniquely showed a tight color. However, foreign pointed rice remained unchanged, and the road for Yin Bian's overhanging seemed slightly wider, and there was also a beautiful color.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various routes along the river were thirty-six and seven. The market for various goods was weak, and the market for white japonica and drought-resistant rice was down by 1-2 jiao. Buying rice was slightly soft. The price of foreign Du's pointed rice from the port was down a few cents to 1 jiao.</p>
<h3>Beiyang Group Inquires About Hunan Machine Rice</h3>
<p>丨Local Appetite is Weak, and Market Conditions Turn Soft丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for foreign customer indica rice turned soft again. The bottom line for foreign customer indica rice on the market is sufficient, and there are also arrivals. The appetite is average, and there is no hope for a sharp increase. Recently, due to the drought and lack of rain, the price of river rice has skyrocketed, and the community households on the street have paid attention to foreign customer indica rice. The market began to improve. Yesterday, the river rice arrived in large quantities and sales were weak, and the price had fallen. The community's appetite for foreign customer indica rice has returned to weakness. It is heard that the group is also not very active, and the market price has fallen. Yesterday, the Beiyang group's appetite turned weak, and they handled 1,150 bags of Hunan machine oil, machine Jing, and machine red rice, which slightly stabilized people's hearts. The street also handled another 1,000 bags, 105 bags of Hunan machine yuan, 384 bags of Quanzhou and Quanzhou machine rice. Also, the street and Fuzhou handled a total of 885 bags of rice. Market conditions were similar to the previous market, but the underlying tone had softened by two or three cents.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Chao Qing Sugar Land Price Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market remained sluggish and weak as before due to sluggish trading. The public price for 14 coarse sand white spot was 19.95 yuan, down 5 cents from before, but there were still few takers. Goods from this firm were stable and had transactions, with a price of 20.05 yuan, Taigu B mark at 20.4 jiao, Jiyi No. 1 white opened at 18.7 jiao, down 2 jiao, Zhenyu wanted 18.8 jiao, but there were no transactions. Only a few dozen bags of domestic sugar, Shangmi white, were offered, with a price of 20 yuan. Since land prices for Chao Qing have rebounded by 4-5 jiao, even if foreign sugar reduces taxes in the future, there will be no excessive easing.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Exchange Rate Rises, Tea Market Turns Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm tea market, the trading of black tea from Qining and other places, except for Huaxiang, which was still selling well, was generally stagnant. As for silk and tea from various routes, only a small amount of drawn-out Zhenmei had some sales. The path for the batch of Zhenmei was greatly reduced. The red and green tea markets were both tending to be weak. The reason for this is that the exchange rates of British and French currencies have consistently increased in recent days. Foreign firms' attitudes towards stocking tea that is not urgent are temporarily holding a wait-and-see attitude. However, according to tea merchants' observations, the harvests in the interior this year have all been discounted. In the future, when the exchange market stabilizes, tea sales will be active.</p>

<h3>On the Construction of Mass Language</h3>
<p>— Fan Zhongyun</p>
<p>Fifteen years of the vernacular movement, and now we hear calls for classical Chinese to rise again. Isn't this a strange thing? But no, in this era where mandarin jackets are becoming popular, this is exactly what we expected.</p>
<p>The vernacular movement was a post-war manifestation of Chinese national bourgeoisie demanding reform and the establishment of a modern China, influenced by the principle of national self-determination. However, this demand was immediately crushed under the immense pressure of international capitalism. Consequently, on one hand, the vernacular movement immediately became a movement to sort out national heritage; on the other hand, it merely transformed the feudal stories of talented scholars and beautiful ladies into descriptions of romances between modern men and women. The vernacular movement, after changing "之乎者也" to "的那吗呢", came to an end.</p>
<p>Therefore, this so-called vernacular is, in reality, not much different from classical Chinese. It not only failed to connect with the general public, but its fundamental consciousness remained the same as classical Chinese: feudal, pleasure-seeking, consumerist, and exploitative. Therefore, it goes without saying that this kind of vernacular needs to be reformed. But to avoid repeating past mistakes, the question arises. ㈠ is the issue of consciousness, pertaining to the expression of thought; ㈡ is the issue of knowledge, pertaining to the enrichment of content. I believe the issue of language is third, but these three must advance simultaneously for success to be achieved.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we need to make the vernacular a vivid language of the general public; on the other hand, the thoughts of the masses are still dominated by texts like "Yinzhiwen" and "Ganying Pian," and we need not shy away from admitting that their level of knowledge is low. In this respect, they are practically a blank slate. Therefore, we must input new knowledge to enrich their vocabulary and introduce new ideas to correct their consciousness. Once knowledge is enriched and thinking is correct, I believe the vernacular and the language of the masses will naturally converge.</p>
<p>Speaking of the dissemination of knowledge and the correction of thought, apart from textbooks, newspapers and magazines are the most important. However, today's textbooks, like the vernacular of the past, are often mere translations of classical Chinese, and current newspapers are filled with expressions of feudal consciousness. For example, when reporting on male-female issues, they say things like "The secret affair has been going on for a long time," or "A clandestine pregnancy results in a swollen belly." Other news often concerns individuals, such as "So-and-so departed from Beijing at such-and-such time by special train, seen off by So-and-so," or "Arrived at such-and-such place at such-and-such time, greeted by So-and-so," or "So-and-so association held a meeting at such-and-such place, attended by So-and-so." Rarely is the social significance of these events pointed out. In short: the formularization of news reporting is due to the deep poison of classical Chinese.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the vernacular movement has been around for fifteen years, the general public still lacks reading material. But since they have already learned to read, they want to read, and have no choice but to seek satisfaction in old novels such as "Water Margin" and "Dream of the Red Chamber," or to read things like "Tixiao Yinyuan" and martial arts novels, or, a little more modern, romance novels from "New Saturday." This low-level taste leads to the prevalence of tabloids and yellow journalism dominating the entire news industry.</p>
<p>Speaking of it, the formation of this phenomenon is still due to the premature end of the vernacular movement. Therefore, those engaged in cultural movements should know that we must first ensure that the general public has something to read. Only in this way can we cut off the remaining influence of classical Chinese and eliminate all the low-level tastes solidified by feudal consciousness of consumption and enjoyment.</p>
<p>To construct mass language literature, we demand reading materials that meet the needs of the masses.</p>
<h3>Two Misconceptions</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Maozu, in discussing "Prohibiting the Study of Classical Chinese and Forcibly Requiring the Reading of Classics," feels that the writing level of the general youth is declining and that they must re-read classical Chinese and write in classical Chinese. Although Mr. Wang is said to be an educator, he is ultimately an amateur in the field of Chinese language teaching. Not only an amateur, but simply beating around the bush and utterly useless.</p>
<p>People who care about education often have two misconceptions: some forget their previous writing level and think that the writing level of modern youth is particularly low. Some forget the incomprehensible elements of classical Chinese writing and think that all incomprehensible elements come from learning vernacular Chinese. I will concede a step and admit that the general writing level is declining and that there are more incomprehensible elements in vernacular Chinese than in classical Chinese, but Mr. Wang's responsibility becomes even greater. Principals of secondary schools in various places tend to hire old-fashioned Chinese language teachers. Most hire so-called "venerable scholars," and those leaning towards the new tend to hire so-called "writers." How can a venerable scholar explain modern Chinese language textbooks? Not only can he not explain masterpieces like Maupassant's "Moonlight Night," but he is also bewildered by Huxley's "Evolution and Ethics." But when it comes to ancient books, their knowledge is limited. Their understanding of classics relies solely on Zhu Xi's commentaries, their knowledge of history is limited to Zuo Zhuan; their understanding of rhetoric and literary theory is even more superficial. Can these kinds of old-fashioned scholars instruct young people with correct knowledge of language and writing skills? As for the writers who are touted as being beautifully talented, their fame only spreads throughout China. Calling on them to teach Chinese language courses, they cannot explain the old and have no way to teach the new. I know of several writer-professors who simply spend time on the podium telling anecdotes and discussing current events. Can this improve the language level of young people? Chinese language teaching is the specialty of a teacher, and cannot be easily handled by three sermons and eight bushels of talent. Therefore, if young people have any shortcomings in language, it is the fault of the secondary school principals who wrongly hired Chinese language teachers. Mr. Wang Maozu is one of those who cannot escape responsibility.</p>
<p>As for the general language level of young people, that is beyond the knowledge of Mr. Wang Maozu. Let me use an analogy from the past to explain the present: Fang Bao and Yao Nai were masters of the Tongcheng School, and their prefaces and inscriptions were quite admirable; but when it came to matters of state, they were full of flaws. Their discussion of border defense affairs was simply a joke. I love Gui Youguang's writings the most, but his large-scale writings are not worth reading. Among the writers of the Tongcheng School, only Zeng Guofan's large-scale writings are pleasing to read. It can be seen that argumentative writing is related to experience and observation, and cannot be deeply observed until after middle age. If we use topics such as "The responsibilities of young people during times of national crisis" and "Reading without forgetting patriotism, patriotism without forgetting reading" to examine students' language level, there is nothing to say beyond platitudes, and it is naturally difficult to get satisfactory results. In fact, even if Fang Bao and Yao Nai were asked to submit papers on such topics within a limited time, they would not be able to write good articles. The national language test questions for university entrance in Europe are mostly practical topics such as "Morning Glow" and "Street," and they never focus on empty theories. (I saw a Chinese language test question on "On Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" at a certain middle school the other day. The use of the word "on" in this test question is incomprehensible; it should be "speak" or "meaning." If you ask Mr. Wang to write an essay on this topic, I dare say Mr. Wang may not be able to produce anything good.) Modern youth have a wider range of knowledge than in the past; all the subjects they learn cultivate organizational skills, so their language level is indeed much higher than that of previous literati. I have carefully studied this issue: the less ancient books one reads, the higher the language level; the more ancient books one reads, the lower the language level; if you don't believe me, you can test it in practice. (As for using the number of typos and the quality of handwriting as language standards, that's a different matter.)</p>
<p>There is also a common concept that misleads young people, which is what educators call "equal emphasis on Chinese, English, and mathematics." The level of language is directly proportional to the amount of common sense; as the ancients said, knowing people and discussing the times requires a rich knowledge of history, otherwise it is difficult to make sound arguments. Su Xun's "Six Kingdoms Theory" was once praised as a masterpiece, but from today's perspective, it is absurd and ridiculous; the fault of selling Yi Guo's abandonment has been passed down for thousands of years; in reality, there are many fallacies; this is all due to ignorance of historical events. To put it bluntly, the more equal the emphasis on Chinese, English, and mathematics, the less time young people have to take care of other subjects, the less common sense they lack, and therefore the more their language cannot progress; only by allowing them to gain more common sense and activate their thinking ability can there be hope for improving the language level.</p>

<h3>On Re-translation and Other Things (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>In my old "Each According to Their Ability," I raised my opposition to re-translation.</p>
<p>There are indeed some bizarre facts in modern China. For example, isn't it still common in China for Dr. Liu Tingfang to translate Maeterlinck's plays from English translations? I think that people with a good command of English like Dr. Liu Tingfang should translate English and American literary works from English rather than translating Maeterlinck.</p>
<p>In my opinion, people with a good command of English should translate more English and American works, and not abandon their strengths to pursue their weaknesses by translating French literary works from English. Those who study French literature should translate more French literary works, and not indirectly translate English and American literature from French translations. In my opinion, it is necessary to directly translate the literature of England, America, France, and Japan. Naturally, Russian literature and German literature need to be translated from English and French, and there is no other way to translate the works of Spain, Italy, Poland, and other small nations except indirectly. In "Each According to Their Ability," when I said, "If there is no other choice, it is permissible," I was referring to the translation of the literature of Italy, Spain, Poland, and other countries.</p>
<p>Regarding indirect translation, we still have some points to pay attention to. First, is the issue of criticism of the translation. I translated Nevirov's "Tashkent" from a French version, but last year I saw a German version of the book that was almost twice as long as the French version. And Louis Sault's "War" seems to have had a large chapter deleted in the French translation. Also, in some Japanese translations, the Japanese language is not very smooth. Isn't this a noteworthy issue? Criticism of translations is very important. Mr. Ma Zongrong is now translating "Don Quixote" from a French translation. He has two French translations, but there are many differences between the two French translations. How can this be done without criticism? Last year, I read Mr. Shen Qiyu's translation of "The Development of European Literature." It was based on a relatively good Japanese translation, and Mr. Shen Qiyu's translation was also quite faithful. However, there were still some funny mistakes. For example, when discussing Vigny's "The Death of the Wolf," the Japanese translator transliterated the word "wolf" as "Woruku," probably treating it as a proper noun, and Mr. Shen Qiyu transliterated it as "A'erke" without criticism. When I first saw it, I was baffled and couldn't remember which of Vigny's works had this A'erke character. But when I looked at the following text, I realized it was the wolf (Loup). Who knew that this wolf, traveling to Russia, then to Japan, and finally to China, had become Mr. A'erke. This point is naturally the mistake of the Japanese translator. Special attention should be paid to the work of criticizing translations!</p>
<p>If the work of criticizing translations is not done, and the work of indirect translation is done carelessly, the result is flawed. For example, Wang Renshu's friend's "Sociological Theory of Art" (Oe) is harmful to society. Over the years, I know of no fewer than three or five people who wanted to directly translate Oe from the original text. Many of them are sound in language and literary cultivation, but once Wang Renshu's inferior translation comes out, even if there are good translations, there will not be much opportunity to publish them. (In my opinion, Mr. Wang Renshu still has a lot of talent, so he doesn't have to translate only the first half of that book from Inoue Isamu's Japanese translation.) However, it would be much better if it were based on a better Japanese translation (the translations of Onishi and Koho). In my opinion, we should try our best to promote direct translation, and when there is no other choice, indirect translation is necessary. However, we must act cautiously, and it is best to base it on translations in more than two languages. And when there is really no other choice, it is possible to talk about flexible methods.</p>

<p>From a certain period onwards, the second-hand stores in Shanghai, quite catering to the preferences of the world, suddenly prospered. I have many friends who are regulars in some second-hand stores. According to their experience running second-hand stores, it is: although there are bargains to be had, after all, the quality of the goods is not as good as new ones.</p>
<p>Second-hand stores specialize in rehashing old goods and selling them at low prices to deceive people; many people flock to them in order to be greedy for small profits. Of course, this also contains elements of the urban recession. But the prosperity of rehashing old goods is not a good phenomenon, but has become a self-evident truth.</p>
<p>Opening our eyes and looking at our literary scene, isn't the trend of rehashing old goods developing in secret? Is this a good phenomenon?</p>
<p>Occasionally reading "Laozi" and "I Ching," one compiles some words that one doesn't even understand the meaning of into articles and sells them to young people who have never read ancient books: reciting Nalan Ci and Ding'an poems, one also writes a large number of post-reading feelings, or even forcibly inserts one's own consciousness, this is one. Reading "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Water Margin," or "Yesou Baoyan," one also forcibly cuts and renders a section of the content, becoming a new creation, this is two. In addition, such as reprinting ancient books, adding punctuation, and attaching eight-legged essay-style annotations. In this way, everyone is eagerly engaged in the work of rehashing old goods, thinking that this is a new trick to open up a new path. But is this really urgent work?</p>
<p>During the May Fourth Literary Revolution, the literary scene was flourishing, the promotion of vernacular Chinese, the overthrow of old poetry, this new literary movement had received the warm support of many young people. Now, how far is this work of rehashing old goods from the spirit of the May Fourth Literary Revolution? After September 18th, followed by January 28th, the country was in great difficulty; the literary scene also showed signs of decline, which is no different from everyone abandoning real life and running towards the grave!</p>
<p>Some people read books with a hobby as a starting point (because I fundamentally oppose reading for food, or reading for fame and fortune, etc.). We cannot force the hobbies of others, so we cannot forcibly prohibit other individuals from browsing and researching valuable old literature, or old books that are only for entertainment. But after browsing and researching personal hobbies, why bother to promote them widely? Is writing post-reading feelings about poetry and lyrics, or introducing the secluded writings of ancient novels, the literary cultivation needed by modern youth? Real life has prepared for us how many materials that can be used for literary and artistic creation. Why do some writers abandon reality and insist on running to the path of emptiness?</p>
<p>The work of rehashing old goods exposes the lack of real-life experience of writers, and thus takes the shortcut of expropriation in this way of avoiding the important and taking the light. This is the result of the recession, just like the prosperity of second-hand stores.</p>
<p>The rehashing of old goods in the literary scene can lure young people into old paper piles and forget reality. In order to save the decline of the literary scene, we should eliminate this work of avoiding the important and taking the light and escaping reality. What we need is something that is full of the spirit of the times and creation!</p>
<h3>Elopement (4)</h3>
<p>— Written by Petőfi of Hungary, translated by Shi Yongyi</p>
<p>Six months after Mrs. Anna and her nephew Karl eloped, a young man suddenly appeared at the home of old Andrew. His face showed an expression of suffering and disappointment.</p>
<p>Old Andrew had just returned from his club with a sad heart. He was grieving over the disappearance of his young wife and his failed chess game with the pastor.</p>
<p>When the young man came in, the old man, his face pale and trembling, collapsed into his chair. The young man took his hand and pleaded:</p>
<p>"Uncle! Dear Uncle! How can I get your forgiveness? I am prepared to follow your solution!"</p>
<p>"Where is she? That woman?"</p>
<p>"She... She... is not here."</p>
<p>The old man sighed deeply with relief.</p>
<p>"I want to tell you the whole story," Karl said. "Look, you should pity me, don't think of me as an enemy. I can't tell you how much I suffered. My happiness did not last long, I lived in a real hell, your wife has an angel's face... but her heart hides all the malice. She is the worst woman I have ever known. I can't live with her anymore... I have abandoned her..."</p>
<p>"My poor nephew... I have to sincerely pity you. But you should also pity me: you have only lived with her for six months, while I have lived with her for a whole year."</p>
<p>"You are also in pain, dear uncle?"</p>
<p>"I think you find it strange, don't you? Everyone thinks we are happy. But when we lived together, you should have seen it, then... you must have known one or two things. Just thinking of her makes me tremble. When I knew you had run away with her, I thanked you, no one has treated me more kindly than you. In order to reward you... when a merchant came to tell me your whereabouts... so I give you an annual subsidy... this way you can stop thinking about coming back and not have economic difficulties..." (The End)</p>
<h3>Night Fishing</h3>
<p>— Wu Wen</p>
<p>Night, the moonlit harbor, my wife counts the fishing lights on the opposite shore. One light, two lights... In the reeds. Clinging to phosphorescent light like soybeans. The still water suddenly ripples with silver snakes, and the two of us work together to haul up a layered net. A pointed, knife-like fish leaps and lightly slips away. Disappointment has become a habit, thankfully my wife is rushing to weave a new net. The child under the black awning is crying, my wife leaves me alone to guard the hatch. A breeze rises, the midnight tide rises, and the sound of fish leaping comes from the next boat.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Classical Chinese, Vernacular Chinese, Mass Language</h3>
<p>— Bai Xi</p>
<p>First, we must pay attention to the reason why we are currently advocating the construction of Mass Language and discarding Classical Chinese and Vernacular Chinese, because the Vernacular Chinese Movement of the Hu Shi era did not actively discard Classical Chinese completely. On the contrary, it colluded with Classical Chinese and implemented a compromise. Therefore, it is inevitable to discard both Classical Chinese and Vernacular Chinese in providing for the construction of Mass Language at present.</p>
<p>Second, we must pay attention to the reason why we want to abandon Vernacular Chinese in the midst of opposing the revival of Classical Chinese, because, first, since Vernacular Chinese has compromised with Classical Chinese, of course, the quality contained in this Vernacular Chinese is no longer the pure quality of Vernacular Chinese. It has become a "hybrid" that is neither Classical Chinese nor Vernacular Chinese. Second, since Vernacular Chinese is compromising with Classical Chinese and stagnating, while the lives of the masses are advancing rapidly due to the promotion of the times, of course, the hybrid Vernacular Chinese does not match the current lives of the masses. It is inevitable to display Vernacular Chinese in the historical museum.</p>
<p>Third, we must pay attention to the fact that our advocacy of Mass Language must "use local dialects as much as possible to connect them into writing," because "dialects" and modern Chinese Mandarin (see Mr. Meng Ke's words quoted by Mr. Song Yang in the Free Talk of Shen Bao on June 26th (note that modern Chinese Mandarin is Mass Language)) although mutually opposed, can also penetrate each other under certain conditions. In order to "improve the modern Chinese Mandarin" as a whole, it is necessary to improve various "dialects" first. When various "dialects" develop to a certain extent, they can penetrate each other and become "modern Chinese Mandarin." I think this can relieve Mr. Goufo and Mr. Meng Ke of some doubts.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must pay attention to the fact that we are currently advocating the construction of Mass Language, and therefore want to discard (I think discard is more appropriate than overthrow) Classical Chinese and Vernacular Chinese, and those who "lump" Classical Chinese and Vernacular Chinese "together" as Mr. Goufo said, because Vernacular Chinese has compromised with Classical Chinese. Of course, since Vernacular Chinese is discarded, it is inevitable to discard Classical Chinese at the same time, so this does not make readers "dazzled and speechless." We know that the May Fourth Revolution did not completely eradicate all the feudal remnants! ...</p>
<p>The above four points were written after reading Mr. Goufo's "Declaration of War on Classical Chinese and Vernacular Chinese" published in Talk in yesterday's issue. I hope everyone will discuss it in twenty-four minutes so that this issue can be expanded and a perfect conclusion can be reached.</p>
<h3>Mass Language</h3>
<p>— Run Feng</p>
<p>I just learned that Mass Language must come from the working class, so yesterday I took a rickshaw to the factory area of Yangshupu to interview Mass Language, because I didn't know what kind of language Mass Language was. As soon as I stepped into the ×× factory, I immediately saw two working-class friends talking. As if I had found a treasure, I immediately walked up to them and stood by, listening quietly to their conversation. The words they said are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>A said, "Old San! Damn it, yesterday (pronounced "re," the following will be similar) Little Jiangbei came to my house to beg for blood. I said, 'Old Master, spare me! These (meaning this) few days, my pockets are empty. I'm thinking about finding a few friends and begging for some blood to use. What are you borrowing from me?'"</p>
<p>Little Jiangbei replied to me, "Damn it! You have to be prettier! We'll always run into each other in the future. Coming to your house to beg for blood today is still thinking highly of you. I don't know you, dog! I recognize you!"</p>
<p>"Old San! Think about it for me, aren't you angry? These few days, my blood is really all gone. Even if he wants to beg for some blood at my house, he should be more polite. I'm not going to give him anything."</p>
<p>B said, "Brother Six! Damn it! Don't say it, Jiangbei's thieving temper is always like that. Last year, he also came to my house to beg for blood, and his face was like a slow-moving master. I scolded him once, and he never came again. Later, when he saw me, he always turned his head and pretended not to see me. Damn it! I wouldn't bother with him either. I'm afraid of him doing something."</p>
<p>"Tonight, let's have tea at Xinminlou."</p>
<h3>What About the Approaching Summer Vacation? | Presented to Student Readers |</h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow, and the summer vacation is almost here! We teachers and staff are anxiously worried about our jobs, while the students are all beaming with joy, jumping for joy. In China, this seems to have become a historical footnote, where all vacations are for playing, and "vacation" is synonymous with "days of play." Now, with the heat pressing down and the temperature soaring above 100 degrees, everyone is undoubtedly looking forward to the arrival of the summer vacation for a comfortable rest.</p>
<p>We not only oppose this, but also feel a deep sense of unease. Frankly speaking, this clearly reveals a weakness in the Chinese national character: seeking leisure and laziness. We know that students are young, energetic, and full of vigor. How can they just focus on seeking leisure and laziness? Looking at it from all angles, most people who serve society don't have summer or winter vacations. The laborers in factories who toil day and night, year after year, don't even know what a summer vacation is called (unless it's long-term unemployment, but even then they have to struggle to survive). Is it really so unbearable for us students to have only three to five hours of classes a day for just four months that we need a long period of rest? No matter how you say it, it just doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>We believe that summer or winter vacations during the academic year are merely an end to classroom learning, just a marker of the length of time, and not a time for everyone to play. We don't use grand excuses like "the nation is in crisis" and everyone needs to "endure hardship and strive for revenge." We are just telling the truth based on facts: summer vacation is not for us to play. We students don't need to play. We should strive for academic research, cultivate our minds and bodies, understand society, and plan for the future. In the vocabulary of students, there should only be "effort" and "progress," and not "laziness" or "rest." This is what we should deeply recognize.</p>
<p>Now that the general premise has been established, let's develop the following arguments.</p>
<p>Because education is not widespread in China, and because China's land is vast and transportation is inconvenient, the existing schools are all located in major cities and towns. In the countryside, apart from incomplete primary schools, you can't find universities or middle schools. Although schools are located in cities, there are not many students in the cities. Most of them still come from the countryside. Because of this, I want to propose a slogan: during the summer vacation, students should "return to the countryside"! I'm not just making a general argument here, asking students to shoulder the responsibility of revitalizing the countryside. Instead, I'm calling on students to go to the countryside to further their studies. The outline is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The study environment in the countryside is good. We know that,</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Cities are densely populated, societies are complex, and everywhere is noisy and chaotic, with temptations and constraints. They are not at all suitable for young students to study hard. Only the countryside is pure, simple, quiet, and pleasant. That's why great philosophers like Rousseau strongly advocated returning to nature. Students should take advantage of the opportunity to leave school during the summer vacation and return to the countryside. They should follow the beautiful natural environment and strive to improve their studies.</p>
<p>(2) Go and understand the real society. Now it seems that everyone is saying that China has reached a point of crisis, and the most dangerous thing is the fundamental bankruptcy of the countryside. However, I think that everyone can probably only say this. No one is very clear about how bankrupt the countryside actually is, or what the real truth of society is. Especially students, who eat well, dress well, and sleep soundly at night, are just like palace maids in deep courtyards, worms in drums, and have no understanding of everything in society. Because of this, they naturally don't know how to work hard when they are studying, and they don't know how to seek transformation after they leave school. The summer vacation is a very good opportunity for us to go to the countryside and understand the reality of society. Moreover, in education, we can say that society is a university, and the knowledge we gain from this university is more valuable.</p>
<p>(3) See the hard work of parents and the difficulty of the source of tuition. Today's general students, once they leave their families, become vague and unclear. In school, they only worry about economic difficulties, not having enough money, and some students even complain about their parents. How inappropriate this is! Parents should of course bear the cost of their children's education, but children should also be thrifty to repay them, especially they should have a special understanding of their parents. See how hard parents work in the countryside, working tirelessly, saving every penny. In this time of rural bankruptcy, how difficult it is to raise tuition fees. Students should return home during the summer vacation to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>I personally strongly advocate that students return to their hometowns during the summer vacation.</p>
<p>The benefits gained, whether in terms of knowledge, physical and mental well-being, or understanding, are immeasurable. If, due to special circumstances, you cannot return to your hometown, you should also use this long summer vacation to go to the library and work hard, and go to factories or slums to do more practical social investigations. If you just eat your fill every day and play recklessly, or sleep in bed all day, that is absolutely inappropriate. As for detailed plans, how to use and allocate time, that is everyone's own business, and I won't elaborate further. In fact, it's useless to come up with them.</p>
<h3>Confidence and Success</h3>
<p>— Tian An</p>
<p>"Things must be rotten before worms grow in them..." This kind of old saying, although humble and not a great theory, also expresses a part of the truth. If a person is at odds with himself and willingly degrades himself, it is extremely difficult to hope to gain the respect and sympathy of others. This is exactly what is called "you reap what you sow," and you can't blame anyone. It's a pity that a good life is wasted in vain, which is too unworthy.</p>
<p>Success and failure in life, whether an individual strives to improve or not, has a decisive significance. In childhood, people are like a blank sheet of paper, dyed blue or yellow. They cannot realize their true position and often treat others as themselves, such as taking other people's opinions as their own. Children often lack confidence and always emphasize their weakness, willingly acting as appendages to their parents and elders. This is a necessary stage in physical development, and we cannot therefore say that children do not seek progress and deny their great future. In fact, the increase in age gradually enriches their physical appearance and also strengthens their inner spirit, especially the spirit of self-confidence, which develops rapidly. Of course, there are exceptions. We only need to see that many adults also lack confidence like children and live a weak and sad life, and it is not difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Our social status is different from that of children and is determined by ourselves. There are many "molds" in society that want to shape us into all kinds of people, and we have the right to choose. People cannot arbitrarily mold us into bad guys, nor can they mold us into sages. We have the right to mold ourselves into whatever kind of person we want to be. We can go up, or we can go down, depending on the degree of our confidence. Confidence often determines whether a person can succeed or not. Confidence is often a prerequisite for success and the driving force for courage and action.</p>
<p>This makes it necessary for us to have a new definition of our attitude towards life. For a person who is full of confidence and wants to work hard to improve, how should he handle his life in society? Will he be arrogant? Will he put on airs? Like many people with confidence? This is a dead end, and everyone can see its danger. Then, will he always have a series of humble words such as "You're old!", "I dare not!", "I am...", and say polite words? This is a spineless, soft performance and a prelude to the failure of people who lack confidence. He will be despised by others. He seems to be very polite, but there must be a limit to politeness, that is, politeness and humility must have a limit. Being too polite and too humble is not good. He cannot lose his independent and self-respecting position. As the saying goes, "A gentleman respects himself." A person with confidence does not necessarily have to be a feudal gentleman, but "self-respect" is an immutable principle for living in the world. Only by respecting yourself and looking up to yourself can you gain the respect and recognition of others. A person who lacks an independent and self-respecting personality will inevitably be looked down upon by others, such as servants, prostitutes, etc. Confidence, and the self-esteem and self-respect that arise from confidence, are the signposts on the road to success!</p>
<p>Remember! Only if you look up to yourself, will others look up to you!</p>
<h3>Treasure</h3>
<p>— Zhong Shuo</p>
<p>The weather was gloomy, the sky was full of fog, and the wind sounded like a threat, somewhat piercing.</p>
<p>Cai Bao, the landlord's servant, got up. His face was gloomy, and a worried expression was revealed. He squatted on the ground, watching Cai Bao's wife flipping through clothes one by one. Every time she turned to a more valuable piece of clothing, she hesitated for a while.</p>
<p>"The grain price is so low! The rent is heavier every year! The remaining coarse grains from last year were only finished last month. This is considered thrifty enough, but what can we do if God wants to abandon people!" Cai Bao spat out a few usual complaints.</p>
<p>Cai Bao's wife wrapped the more valuable clothes together. After hearing these words, she just sighed "Alas."</p>
<p>Cai Bao was about to leave, when Cai Bao's wife picked up a brand new cotton-padded jacket made of local cloth that had been worn two or three times, and said gloomily:</p>
<p>"Take this too!"</p>
<p>"Leave it behind! It's a pity to wrap up something new!"</p>
<p>"Can hunger be tied down? It would be better to take it to pawn for more money!"</p>
<p>Cai Bao unwrapped the package, and couldn't help feeling a pang of sadness. He remembered that when the rice ran out for the first time last month, he had pawned all of his wife's dowry clothes from the year before, leaving only this cotton-padded jacket. But now, it still can't escape this fate!</p>
<p>Cai Bao took the cotton-padded jacket. Suddenly, it felt like a knife point was grabbing his heart, and tears streamed down.</p>
<p>"Go quickly!" Cai Bao's wife sobbed.</p>
<p>Cai Bao wiped away his tears with his sleeve, sighed slowly, raised his head, and walked away. The needle-like northwest wind outside was getting stronger and stronger, hitting his face. His body heat, blown by this wind, felt like falling into an ice cave, and his heart couldn't help but tremble. "How can I be so useless!" When this thought turned in his mind, he gritted his teeth, straightened his chest, and walked on.</p>

<h3>On the Desire for Beauty</h3>
<p>— 𠆩 Ting</p>
<p>The love of beauty is a human instinct. In our daily life and behavior, we often see manifestations of this desire. For example, loving to wear beautiful clothes, loving to eat palatable food, loving to live in elegant houses, loving to walk on quiet and clean paths, loving to see pleasing things, loving to hear interesting stories: these are all manifestations of the desire for beauty.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, some people also say that life is about loving ugliness, the so-called evil desire. They say: Because we often see manifestations of human evil desires, such as: loving to kill, loving to invade, loving to harm natural creatures, loving to do things that benefit oneself and harm others. In this world, we have encountered many, many such facts.</p>
<p>So, do people love beauty or ugliness? Needless to say, people love beauty, because the love of beauty is a human instinct. The reason why people have evil desires is because the environment is bad, in other words, because they are people who are active under such a system.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to wash away the existence of that kind of ugly concept in the world and fight against the desire for beauty, I think it is necessary to talk about it.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the desire for beauty is a kind of desire for beauty, like the desire for food and the desire for sex. Of course, human thinking is complex, and there are many desires, not just the desire for beauty. For example, the desire for profit, the desire for knowledge, the desire for morality, the desire for survival, the desire for food, the desire for sex, etc. But the desire for beauty is one of the most important desires in life. Without the desire for beauty, what kind of ugly animals would humans become!</p>
<p>Therefore, some people say: "Truth, Beauty, and Goodness" are the three major elements of life.</p>
<p>So what is "Truth"? The pursuit of truth is a desire for knowledge, and the object of the pursuit of truth is science, because the origin of science is explained by knowledge.</p>
<p>What about "Goodness"? The pursuit of goodness is a desire for morality, and the object of the pursuit of goodness is morality, because the origin of morality is based on human behavior. Therefore, humans have measured present behavior through standards.</p>
<p>As for "Beauty"? The pursuit of beauty is naturally a desire for beauty, and the object of the pursuit of beauty is art, because the origin of art starts from human instinct.</p>
<p>Therefore, the main requirement generated by the desire for beauty is art, and art is one of the most valuable and meaningful things for mankind.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that the pursuit of beauty is a driving force for advancing life towards ideals. In order to change the form of human life and ugly concepts, the pursuit of beauty is a force that forms this new life.</p>
<h3>Yearning</h3>
<p>— Cun Yin</p>
<p>Xiangtan, my hometown.</p>
<p>There, I have my father and mother. There is also a younger brother and sister.</p>
<p>On a morning before the sun had risen, my father held my brother and carried a small suitcase. I carried the luggage. My mother held my sister.</p>
<p>Five people. Only four people's feet stepped on the hot dirt road.</p>
<p>There were no words on the road. Because we had already said a lot last night.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the pier, the sun had already climbed over the top of the mountain. It scorched all our sweat out.</p>
<p>We got on the boat.</p>
<p>In the cabin, we bought a berth from the tea room.</p>
<p>My father and mother's eyes were full of tears.</p>
<p>"Yin, when you get to Hankou, take the boat to Shanghai. There, your uncles are waiting for you!"</p>
<p>My father said with concern.</p>
<p>"Yin'er, you should take care of yourself on the road!"</p>
<p>My brother and sister both stared at me. These passionate eyes made my tears drip uncontrollably.</p>
<p>"Father, Mother. You should rest assured. Your child will definitely..." I sobbed.</p>
<p>My brother secretly tugged at my clothes and said.</p>
<p>"Brother. You must come back sooner!"</p>
<p>I suppressed some bitter smiles from my sadness and put them on my face, nodding to him.</p>
<p>"The boat is leaving!" "The boat is leaving!"</p>
<p>These sounds were like a sharp steel arrow. It struck my heart.</p>
<p>Everyone lowered their heads and couldn't speak.</p>
<p>Finally, I said to them, "Goodbye!" and bowed three times.</p>
<p>Quickly, they walked onto the pontoon boat.</p>
<p>The boat moved slowly.</p>
<p>I leaned on the railing and carefully watched the four faces.</p>
<p>Just as their four figures were about to become unclear, I took out a handkerchief and waved it at them.</p>
<p>In the distance, a little child was also waving.</p>
<p>"They must still be looking at me!"</p>
<p>I thought. My hand waved more and more tightly.</p>
<p>The boat accelerated mercilessly, and that side had turned into a white expanse.</p>
<p>Now, this has been five years ago! However, I still seem to be waving a handkerchief at them.</p>
<p>Xiangtan, my hometown, here is a fallen person, kissing your name!</p>

<p>Correspondence Column</p>
<h3>Workers' Supplementary Education Teacher</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am a female worker who sells her labor in a pharmaceutical factory. This pharmaceutical factory itself has many contradictions, and it uses special methods to oppress the workers. The contradictions are its own business, and we don't need to worry about it, but the oppression is our own pain, so we have to write it out and appeal to the public for help.</p>
<p>We sell ten hours of labor, but what do we get in return? Thirty cents a day, plus the mockery and abuse of the managers. This is a common phenomenon in general factories, and I don't need to be surprised and point it out in detail, but our factory director is different from others. He has come up with an incredible way to oppress us for both fame and fortune. He runs a night school and forces us to study. Others will definitely think that the factory director is very kind and is actually benefiting the workers by giving them supplementary education. In fact, ivory doesn't grow from a dog's mouth, and he doesn't have such intentions. It is because there are many drug names, so he forces us to attend night classes for one hour every day, teaching us to memorize X brand soda, X brand Marphinac, etc. There is nothing else besides this. Can this be considered supplementary education? Especially that slave-like teacher, who gets money from the factory and becomes arrogant, oppressing and humiliating us in every way (especially the young girls). Under this tyrannical power, we can only go to the toilet and cry.</p>
<p>Because the hot summer has arrived, the journey back home is already exhausting, and in addition, we have to do some personal chores: we have to eat, bathe, wash clothes, and those with children have to raise them. It is really impossible for us to go to school again. Therefore, many people don't go, and some people ask to study outside the factory. Who knows that the factory, which doesn't care about the lives of others, issued a decree: those who don't attend classes will be fired, and those who study outside will be fired. Should we attend classes this late? God, is our suffering brought out of our mother's womb? Isn't it enough for us to leave our families and sell ten hours of labor and sweat?</p>
<p>Because I live far away (more than five miles away), I have not attended night classes once, but I have been fired because of this. Several others have also been fired in the same way. We are going to be tortured by life again. Please, kind people who care about the people's livelihood, come and rescue us! Best regards,</p>
<p>Sincerely, Xu Man</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I am a friend of the female worker. Because she doesn't write very well, I ask you to be a ghostwriter. But mistakes are inevitable, please correct them and publish them. Ghostwriter's postscript</p>
<p>Editor's note: Improving the skills of the average person who will rely on wages to eat, so that their productivity is increased, and therefore the people who employ their labor are more profitable than employing uneducated people. In this society, the purpose of education is originally like this. The so-called supplementary education in Xu Jun's factory is just a very clear ironclad proof of this fact. Xu Jun is unemployed, and his current problem is to find another job. The motivation for writing the letter is probably that he is too angry, not that he wants me to discuss with him what attitude to take towards this kind of education, so I will not say how to deal with the factory. However, I think that the workers of the factory should unanimously demand the factory to cancel this kind of school, otherwise, this kind of learning should also be regarded as a part of the work, and the factory must also pay wages. This requirement is very reasonable.</p>
