<p>吾人隔昨一評。旣對現行之中學教育制度有所商榷。以爲各級職業學校不妨單獨設立。而普通中學仍應兼具職業學校之性質。而不當視爲純粹的升學預備機關。茲復欲就發展中等師範與職業教育問題。一爲探討。而估量教部新定中等教育經費支配標凖之價值。　　教部某君。嘗發表關於本問題之負責談話。其大意略謂。我國普通中學。異常發達。而職業與師範教育則均少進展。尤以職業教育爲甚。是以教部之新方針。在限制普通中學經費。以供擴充職業及師範教育之用云云。年來我國因中等教育之畸形發展。以致小學缺乏健全之師資。而不能升學之普通中學畢業生。亦不能從事職業。凡此皆爲鐵鑄事實。微某君言。吾人亦早深抱同感。然吾人以爲茲事體大。欲謀補救。當先洞燭過去中等教育失敗之癥結所在。兼顧各地社會環境。以作通盤之籌畫。然後由全國上下。按規定之程序。共謀貫澈。若徒恃最高之教育行政機關單方努力。而以經費支配標凖爲主要工具。竊恐當局縱極賢勞。仍必無濟於事。吾人深覺。欲謀中等教育之發展。當先求初等教育基礎之穏固。中等師範教育之目標。在爲小學謀健全之師資。固爲世界各國所同然。至於職業教育之於我國。亦應先向小學致全力。則或非人人所共知。過去中等師範學校及職業學校之所以不如普通中學之發達。實内師範與職校之畢業生與不能升學之普通中學畢業生一般感覺無出路。而師範與職校畢業生。因其所學比較中學爲專門。故其出路乃尤較中學爲稀少。中等師範畢業生進一步不過爲小學教師。中等職校畢業生。進一步不過爲新式之工頭。二者性質雖不同。而其不爲社會所重視則一。惟中學畢業生進一步則爲人人艷羨之大學生。一俟大學畢業。雖仍有失業之慮。然此究爲數年後事。在此數年中儘可逍遥自在。是以多數青年願爲大學生候補之普通中學生。而不願爲小學教師或新式工頭候補之師範或職校生。政府誠欲避免中等教育畸形發展之流弊。當先確定師範與職業教育之方針。其道無他。即在小學教育方面做工夫。使師範生有正當及滿意之出路。而有用青年亦不致向中等職校糜費光陰金錢。結果仍不能售其所學也。　　茲請先言小學之師資問題。我國之小學教師。向稱清苦。在昔科舉時代。惟屢試不第之童生老儒。始肯在三家村坐冷板櫈。勉過學究生活。以盡其餘年。即在今日小學教師之待遇。仍菲薄異常。即如鄉村師範之重要。已爲識者所共知。而江蘇鄉村小學教師之月俸平均不及二十五元。安徽不及十四元。河北平均十一元。最低僅四元。江西平均僅八元。然而事有出人意料之外者。江蘇爲我國小學教育比較最發達之一省。而二十一二兩年度省縣立師範畢業生不能覓得位置者。幾達半數。該省教育廳長鑒於全省小學師資頗有供過於求之現象。乃謂。（兄弟已深信在蘇省中等教育方面。不但普通中學已不能任意澎漲。即在師範學校。亦應該設法緊縮。）其他各省之情形。雖或不盡如江蘇之惡劣。而連年師範畢業生中有不少賦閒失業或改謀生計。仍爲不可掩飾之事實。目前小學教師之待遇。旣如是其菲薄。而師範學生之出路。又如是其困難。吾人縱能在中等教育經費總預算中。將師範學校經費。由百分之十加至百分之二十五。結果除多少改良學校之設備與教學外。何足以鼓勵一般學生投身於師範教育之興趣。或引起一般父兄送其子弟入師學校之熱忱。試問有健全之小學師資。而無可以安揷之小學。或有小學教師之位置。而所入不足以養父母畜妻子。誰願因師範學校之略有改良。而遽易其淡視師範教育之態度。且即退一步而假定師範教育果將因經費增加而大形發達。亦不過造成更多之斯文失業份子而已。　　次之。請就中等職業教育一言。我國職業教育。濫觴於遜清之末年。而成績未著。考其所以失敗之原因。一則在我國生産事業之幼推。除少數工業區域外。缺乏可供職校發展之基礎。二則在辦學者不知注意當地社會經濟狀况生産組織與夫原料供給等情形。以致學校教課。不能與時地相適應。三則在實業與經濟界中人不知與辦學者謀密切之合作。贊助職校之進行。而促其成功。今日職業學校之畢業生。固不能謂多。而已有就業不易之嘆。據二十二年江蘇教育統計。全省高中職業科畢業生。不能找得職業者。約佔百分之四十四。教部專員李熙謀報告。安徽蚌埠蕪湖等處職校。及江西第一職校等之畢業生。亦感覺無出路之苦。平心而論。此豈學生之過。國聨勞工局副長莫列德氏嘗語我國教部當局。謂中國應辦實用之職校。切勿虚裝門面。其言自可令人深念。吾人以爲今日最切實用之職校。非爲中等或中等以上之職校。而爲以改良手工業爲目標之初等職校也。若吾人不察全國各省市有無共同需要中等職校之事實及其環境。而貿然通令大量增設。其結果與擴充中等師範而忽略其畢業生之出路。無以異也。　　故吾人欲爲政府建議者。（一）在中等師範教育方面。應先努力於小學教育之發展。以期增加小學教師之需要與師範學生之出路。同時。須（甲）檢别各地小學教師。將不甚稱職者撤職。予以適當之訓練。而由師範畢業生承其乏。惟在撤職教師之訓練期間。生活費用。仍須照當供給。訓練費用。亦由公家負擔。（乙）提高小學教師之報酬。採取效率加薪法。及養老金制度。以奬勵其勞績。（丙）設立假期學校及短期補習班。以提高在職教師之能力與學識。并涵養其事業之興趣。　　（二）在職業教育方面。應分别職校所在地之實際需要與環境。除少數新式工業區域外。大可緩行擴充中等或中等以上之職校。而應致全力於初等職校之添置。至於工業區域中之中等職校。（甲）應注意當地經濟情形與社會需要。然後定其特殊之課程興實習。而於舊有之工業。尤當力謀改良。（乙）由政府奬勵私人農工商等實業機關容納職校學生前往實習。以資觀摩。至於官營之實業機關及工廠。應力謀開放。更不待言。（丙）各地職校。應由當地職業界代表及校長教員。組織學校委員會。以求學校與社會之合作。（丁）倣效法國職業教育視學制。於每重要區域設置視學員。其職務除視察學務外。並爲學校與職業界溝通聨絡。且與中央教部督學作業務上之諮詢與商榷。　　總之。吾人欲矯中等教育畸形發展之弊。應就發展小學教育及中等學校畢業生謀生困難之實際情形。以謀解决。若不之此圖。而徒謀中等學校經費標凖之改革。竊恐影響所及。不惟不能爲師範職校學生增加得業之可能性。或且因是種學校學額之擴充而更加深現有之恐慌也。日本外務省</p>

<p>－答王載甫君－　　鷄生蛋的問題，是不僅只限於鷄的問題，而是生物全體的起源問題。這問題的實際上的内容就是：一切生物在最初就已經是生物了嗎，抑或最初僅只是蛋的形態呢？　　要解决這問題，生物學上的知識自然是不可少的，同時，正確的思想方法也是必須要把握住的。僅僅有一點零碎的科學知識而無正確的方法使之成爲系統，那我們對於這個問題仍舊得不到一貫的了解。　　在從前的科學界裏，對於生物起源的問題就有着兩種解决法，第一種是所謂的自然發生説，認爲一切生物都是由無生物中自然發生的，照這一種説法，則鷄在最初是鷄，不必由蛋生出來，例如米變老鼠，腐草變螢虫等。這種説法在十九世紀後半期已被德國微生物學者巴斯德攻破了。去年中國的羅廣廷博士自稱又證實了這種學説，全國學者都揭破了他的荒誕，現在我們都知道這種説法是不成立的。　　第二種説法是認爲生物絶對不能自然發生，地球上所以有生物，是因爲宇宙中原來有生物的種子，這種子被隕石之類的天體破片帶到地球上來、就漸漸發展成現在的樣子。依這種説法、生物最初是（蛋）的形態，遇到地球上的適宜的環境，才孵化而成生物。這種學説並不能徹底地解决問題。它假定生物是來源於種子，但如果我們再問問種子又是怎樣形成的呢？就没有辨法解答了。因爲這種學説是與自然發生説完全反對的它不承認種子可以由無生物發生，旣不是從無生物中發生，那麽是那裏來的呢？結果似乎只有用上帝的創造來説明，將我們引導進宗教的靈魂陣裏！　　在目前，我們都知道生物是常常進化的、在進化的過程程中，生物體的構造由簡單而變爲複雜，由低級而變爲高級。換一句話説，愈更是最古以前的生物，它們的身體的構造愈更簡單，三千萬年前的世界上只有大爬蟲，比較現在的人類以至於牛馬虎豹等是低級得多了。但在三千萬年前的千數萬年以前，還有一個連爬蟲也不是的時代。那時只有腔腸蠕動物，介殻動物等類的簡單動物。然而這一些簡單的動物，比較那更古的生物，仍是複雜得多了。更古的更簡單的生物是單細胞生物。腔腸動物之類無論怎樣簡單，它總是無數萬的細胞組織成的，單細胞生物只由一個細胞就能形成獨立的生物體。這種單細胞生物在今日仍遺留下來不少的種類，他們在顯微鏡的世界中持續着那微渺的生活。　　進化論的學説，是由化石學，血清學，比較解剖學等種種方面，得到了確切不移的證據、現在已經没有人再能推翻它了。我們現在己經能確信生物的各種種族並不是由無生物中自然發生出來，而是在進化的悠久的程途上發展分化而成的。如果説種族可以直接由無生物産生，那就會根本動摇了進化的法則。旣然我們現在已不能否定，進化的法則，那麽像米變老鼠等羅博士式的自然發生説就不能成立了。但同時，因爲我們相信最古最古的生物是最簡單的單細胞生物，故我們也不能否定，在悠久的以前的某一個時候，那時的生物一定簡單則與無生物相差無幾，更進一步説，我們還以假定在某一定的原始的時期。無生物因了一定的化學物理作用而形成最初的生物，這生物是後來一切生物的肇始，是一種簡單到和無生物幾乎没有分别的小生命。這也是一種的自然發生説，但這種自然發生説與米變老鼠的説法絶對不同，而且在進化論上有科學根據的、不這種自然發生説正是，進化論的理論所必然要達到的結論。　　就今日科學研究的結果來説，我們所能假定的最初的生物的形態一定仍是單細胞的形態，不過那最初的單細胞一定比現在所遺留下來的單細胞生物簡單得多了。如果説單細胞的形態就是蛋的形態，而世界上一切生物都是由單細胞生物演進而來，那麽，我們可以馬上就達到（是怗生鷄而不是鷄生蛋）的結論了。但是事情决不能説得這樣簡單。我們要注意鷄是多細胞動物，多細胞生物的繁殖生活與單細胞是不同的構成鷄的整個身體的億節細胞，遲早會。隨着鷄的本身而死去，所以必須用生蛋的方式來維持種族的存在。但就單細胞生物來説，它自身旣能生存，也能由自身分裂而繁殖，因此在單細胞生物中（鷄）和（蛋）的分别是没有的，單細胞自己就是鷄。也就是蛋，（鷄）和（蛋）這兩種，對立的作用，在單細胞生物裏是溶合在一起，是隠伏着的矛盾，是潛在地作用着的，這時我們根本就是能問是蛋生鷄，或是鷄生蛋，我們也可以説是蛋生蛋，也可以説鷄生鷄。因爲單細胞動物的本身你就不能嚴格的地説它是蛋抑或是鷄。　　因此鷄生蛋的問題，必須在有了鷄以後才可以發生，換言之，這問題是要對於多細胞動物才有意義的。生蛋而又由蛋生出來的事情，是多細胞生物中特有的現象。如果生物中没有多細胞生物的成立，也决不會有這種現象。於是我們知道，多細胞生物的成立，是這一種現象的前提條件，也旣是説，鷄的本身的成立，是生蛋的前提條件。根據這一點，我們就應該把鷄看做基礎，説是鷄生蛋，而不是蛋生鷄。　　由生物進化的實例來説，最簡單的多細胞生物，並不是用産生種子的現象來行其繁殖作用的。團藻的子體是直接由母體分出，水泄珊瑚等腔腸動物是用發芽的方式生殖，這告訴我們，在生物進化的過程中，多細胞生物最初形成的時候也不是馬上就有産生種子的現象的。産生種子的現象是在多細胞生物已經發達到更複雜更高級的狀態中時才出現的事。到這樣的時候，鷄與蛋的對立作用才從潛伏的狀態而分化成顯在的狀態，而開始了鷄生蛋蛋生鷄的循環。　　這樣，我們可以斷定，在最初的時候，蛋是鷄生的。以後，鷄和蛋就互爲因果地無限地循環下去。循環作用和相互作用是我們所承認的。但我們還要在循環中找到最後的起點，在相互作用中找到根本的主導作用，不然，我們就會成爲折衷主義者。</p>

<p>— 剝</p>
<p>時代的進化，有的説是直綫，有的説像波紋，更有人曾經根據袖口之大而變小，小而變大，决定是循環。這都是超超名理，但説這些話的人們，忘記了一件事，忘記了時代是由人類决定的，以爲這是另外一個星球的事，而不知便是自己及自己之流的事。</p>
<p>自己怎樣决定時代呢？倘若是坐在書齋里抱膝長吟，或在樹蔭里聽蟬鳴，去社會益遠，二者都不發生影響。及至或上了政治的舞臺，或銀行里有鉅額的存欵，或有掉三寸不爛之舌的才辯，隠隠然便有操縱時代轉移時代的感覺了，那時便將（放屁放屁，眞正豈有此理）！</p>
<p>然而有了感覺又怎樣呢，必有理想，必有經營，必有動作，必有效用。那麽時代是否受影響呢？這是一個極淺顯的例子可以證明的：</p>
<p>在公共遊藝塲所，時常有一小籠，籠里往往有一對鐵絲作的一個圓球，彷彿地理教科書上的經綫，其中關着白老鼠數位，日夜地踏着這籠，向上呀！前進呀－但路程不見减少，而那種經營是頗費苦心的，一天所踏的路程應該是若干里吧。這就成爲看客的娛樂之一，有趣！</p>
<p>設若爲鼠輩設想，不在籠子里趕車，跑出來奔跑，至少路程是可以不同點吧，外間不及籠子里安適，但也受陜隘的包圍，不受看客的嘲笑。這麽用力要跑向何處去呢？永遠給人們開心麽？</p>
<p>眞所謂（人之賢不肖，譬之如鼠矢）！用去的力量相同，但結果大有差别；對於時代的决定每個人都有力量的，只要打破了週遭的牢籠。</p>
<h3 id="c223">（文學不死，大禍不止） <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 黄平陵</p>
<p>吳稚暉先生在申報自由談給大衆語專家曹聚仁一封信，其中有兩句對文學表示十分厭惡，痛恨的名言，曰：（文學不死，大禍不止。）由吳先生的筆底，寫出這兩句憤語來，我們並不驚異；因爲吳先生一向是以提倡科工爲職志的。</p>
<p>不過，提倡科工，並不自吳先生始；從張之洞主張西學爲用，中學爲體，以至於遜清末造的洋務自强新論時代，以至於民國五六年間的職業教育全盛時代，以至於此刻的專重科工時代，可見中國無時無刻不在提倡科學，鼓吹工藝；而中國的派遺留學生遠在道同年間，距今已有六十年的歷史了；其間所派遣的留學生，大約十分之七是研究科工的，十分之三是學習軍事的。至於由國家正式派遣青年到域外去研究文學，簡直没有這回事，（自費者除外。）文學之在中國，可以説從來就没有提倡過。</p>
<p>吳先生疑心中國科工之不如人，乃由於研究文學者的衆多，其實完全不是如此。據我們創辦六七年文藝刊物的經騐，覺得在此刻能够把作品寫得像樣些的人，統國中而論，還找不到一打；統國中比較像樣一些的文藝刊物，僅有二三種，就些二三種幾乎誰都不免感覺到創作的缺少；最近，中國的三兩家電影公司，没有一家不在閙劇本荒。像這樣下去，中國的文學，一定會死的；不過，文學死了以後，大禍能不能止，這責任就都要研究科工的人完全負担了。</p>
<p>提倡了有六十年之久的科工，耗費了國家無慮幾千萬兆金鎊的留學費，到現在，我們的日常必需品，除了應用舶來品，就祇有退化到荒古的石器時代，是誰之過？四千年來號稱以農立國的中國，依然是沿用着我們老祖宗所發明的舊套，是誰之過？習商的，習工的，習建築的………在中國有的是，而至於今，無法仿造一個電燈泡子，無法自製一個螺絲釘，不論大小土木工程，無一不是依賴外國人做我們的顧問，究竟是誰之過？</p>
<p>（文學）寒不可以爲衣，飢不可以爲食，誠然是無用的廢料。但，歐美的科學文所以有燦爛的今天，誰都是歸功於十七世紀的文藝復興，不知是什麽緣故。以希特萊的黷武主義者，猶不免盡量尊崇老作家霍甫德曼，不惜巨資建造華格羅的音樂紀念堂，爲哥德舉行盛大的百年紀念，不知是什麽緣故。雄武一世的墨索里尼，對國内的知識份子無不優禮有加尤其是對文藝作家鄧南遮，不知是什麽緣故。法國舉行國葬的，不過五次，而文藝家囂俄，法朗士居其二，不知是什麽緣故。最近蘇俄秉政的大抵是出身於文藝界，而並不妨碍於他們的五年計劃，是事實；日本的文藝空氣已經這樣濃厚，而文部省依然輔助文藝的進展，東京的帝大並没有廢除文學系，也是事實。在中國並没有人明目張膽地提倡過文藝運動，國家從來就没有對文學犧牲過一個留學費，政府從來就没有對文藝的設施有過絲客的計劃。僅僅是憑着極少數人的趣味偶而對文學作極底限度的貢獻，就不免遭着吳稚暉先生那樣惡毒的咀咒，眞太可憐了。</p>
<p>當然的，吳先生是急切盼望中國走向復興之路的，可是，不有文藝家在那規規矩矩地工作着，提高國民向上的意志，改變國民日趨於没落的病態，振奮民族偉大的精神，恐怕學科工的人雖然多，提倡科工的人雖然多，而要使國家收到科工的實効，總覺得有些困難吧！因爲他們學的雖然是科工，而他們仍舊是抱着（學而優則仕）的老觀念，决没有這樣的儍瓜眞的跑向科學界和工藝界去的。</p>
<h3 id="c224">（拿貨色看）的問題 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 佛朗</p>
<p>大衆語問題一直討論到現在，也還有人以爲大衆語文學是一種面目全新，一嗚驚人的東西，實在是不該的。例如某某先生那篇（嘗試一下）的文章，就有這樣的意思。</p>
<p>建立大衆語文學，其實并不完全（否定）了白話文，去從新（創造）出一種三頭六臂的大衆語文字，而正是從白話文去掉有害的質素—夾雜的文言，歐化的語調和一切不適合大衆需要的東西。大衆語文字，雖和白話文不一樣，但大衆語文字并非完全把五四以來的白話文否定了，另來一樣（全新）的文字。我們知道言語文字的長成和改革是慢慢地的，其中必定有它改革變遷的過程。全新的大衆語文字，實在不能（突能）地産生，假如能够這樣、那不是大衆語文字，而是（天書）！</p>
<p>許多人有了這種（高調）的傾向，便發生出（拿貨色來）和（大衆語文字要用怎樣的形式出現）的兩個問題。</p>
<p>某先生也説：（拿出大衆語的作品來，拿出大衆語文字的Model來）（模特兩字似可用（樣子）兩字代替）這種急要人拿出貨色來的態度，不是頂合理的。大衆語文學不是（紅豆刨冰），祇消把冰一刨，内加紅豆湯便可立刻送到嘴上。大衆語文字的提倡是使人先知道這種需要，然後逐漸向這方面去改革完成－應用大衆流行的新口頭語，除掉夾雜文言，歐化語調，在衆生活開展中一起成長。貨色是有的，但不是紅豆刨冰一樣的可以立刻解你才的渴，若要現在看貨還價，那就祇有如某人所（造）的一篇大衆語作品一樣的可笑了。這可以説，并没有碰到大衆語文學建立問題的本身！</p>
<p>由於急要（貨色）在（大衆語文學要用怎樣形式出現這一問題下，便有些人力主實行用土話方言，所以主張用土話方言寫作，以爲是大衆語文學貨色的，根本是有着這一貫的錯誤。我曾經中在華日報副刊上發表過兩篇對於土話方言意見的文章，我的意思，以爲：自然地採用土話方言没有什麽不好，若果把土話方言作爲大衆語的重要因素，勉强凑用起來，或者完全用土話來寫作是無論如何行不通的。至今提出這個問題討論的人很多，贊成與反對都有，但我仍堅决的主張純土話方言對於大衆語文字建立并不重要，而以爲提出純土話方言文學的人是多少犯着上述急於要拿貨色給人看的錯誤。</p>
<h3 id="c225">失業一週年 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>從去年暑假脱離學校之後，出路問題就苦惱着我，託朋友親戚寫介紹信，四處奔走尋機遇，然而完全失望了。旣無錢妄想跟朋友出洋去，找位置又找不到，其實我没有過大的奢望，縱使一名小職員的位置也願就，只是如是的願望也不能如願，於是開始做故鄉的蟄居人了。</p>
<p>季節很快的楞轉着拐過去，炎陽逼照的暑天過後，接着是風風雨雨的秋天；看庭前飛過雪花，新年之後，是新春的好天氣，寂寞中看桃花開了又落了，濃春又跚跚的踏過人間了，一轉眼間，又是苦熱的日子，現在又是去年失業的時節啦！但是我還是那樣兒楞住在家鄉，找不到噉飯地，凝望着窗前的陽光，早上移下墻，傍晚悄悄的移回去，一天天的挨過去，窮窘的生活逼迫着，像什麽也無話可説的</p>
<p>—失業已是一週年！</p>
<p>瞪着壁上已撕了大半本的日曆，自己那麽嘆息着</p>
<p>自己的失業，實在早就是預料到的，生在當今的時代，尤其是社會不景氣的這年頭，像我那樣的人，被列入失業羣中是很應該説必然的。全世界的不景氣現象，當然也影響到一個無名小卒的生路；一方面自己的過分無用，不能迎合於一個流氓式的社會，我老是儍着要保留一點兒做人的誠實處，於是更遭碰壁失敗。</p>
<p>廣闊的世界上，我尋不到噉飯的地方，楞住在狹的籠似的家鄉，像寄生蟲那麽地，吸蝕没有了脂肪的祖母老父的枯腸管壁，一顆傷痛的心，漸向下沉，向着黄昏，將形成一個歇斯特里的病態者了。</p>
<p>又到了暑盡秋初的時節了，失業已是一週年了啊</p>
<p>去年今日我徬徨在街上，今年還是同樣的徬徨着，一顆創痛的心嘶呌着：</p>
<p>—我要生活啊—！</p>
<h3 id="c226">唱不啞拉不斷為了生活 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>

<p>— 蒲風</p>
<p>不管你跑到里加坡，爪哇，香港，紅毛婦人手裏牽着狗在街上走，原是最普遍的事；就在上海，我們也隨便可以得到證明。</p>
<p>狗為什麽特别被女人們所愛好呢？</p>
<p>會守門，專門欺視衣服襤褸類乞丐般的人，會親主子，這是我們所曉得的狗。可是，現今，被牽在手裏的哈吧狗，是不用作守門，而是偏於親主子一方，跟主人日玩夜玩的，一句話，牠只是主人的一種玩具。</p>
<p>如果女人們需要玩具，正有如小孩子的需要糖果，狗，這東西顯然就有足够的資格被女人們所愛好了呵！</p>
<p>當你走在霞飛路上，看看一頭一頭的狗被牽在西婦手裏也罷，即使你看見牠們被抱在汽，車裏，貴婦人在施着温柔的撫慰，你也用不着羨慕。問題是在牠們已是千眞萬確的一種玩具。——失業，饑餓跟寒凍，理應使我們對她們每天拿牛肉喂狗感到憤怒，感到做人的羞恥，你還對牠們垂涎嗎？</p>
<p>自然呵，已經眞正變爲一種玩具，要是上帝永遠在爲富人們説着公正話，像狗，牠是應該享福的。狗，正因爲被豢養着而感到幸福，這幸福，牠是驕傲着以爲將繼續無窮哪！</p>
<p>但是，你能够説被抱在女人懷裏，被牽在女人手裏的光是哈吧狗一種嗎？我相信，不用先知爲我們作明證，許多男人正像哈吧狗般被豢養着；同樣，他們的美夢也永遠不會自醒的哩！</p>

<p>但是現在呢，他想想，自己摇着頭。</p>
<p>時候是不早了，對面的店舖連燈也關了有半個鐘頭，他只好站起來，摇摇幌幌地向着前面走了兩步，可是突然間，一個人闖進來了。</p>
<p>（是哪一個呢）？他在心中想着，他的眼睛可實在有點看不清。若只是説因爲他是老了，自力有點不中用。那也不是盡然的事；倒是爲了多喝點酒，纔更糢糢糊糊地看不清楚什麽。</p>
<p>他把手掌抹着眼睛，那個進走來的人用洪亮的聲音嚷着：</p>
<p>（你眞是老了，老爹，看不出來我麽？）</p>
<p>（接着是一陣粗野的笑，來人的臉更向着他凑近一點。）</p>
<p>這他看得出來一些了，那是一個像肥大的南瓜一樣的臉，長着連腮連髮的鬍子，鼻子却像懸着的一個紅椒。他記起來了，他呌着：</p>
<p>（亞利賽，是你吧，有一個月話没有到我這裏來了。）</p>
<p>他高興着，自以爲喝了更多的酒的樣子，用短促的聲音談話，故意把手戰顫着拍着來人的肩頭。</p>
<p>（前兩個星期我不是到你這裏來了麽，你的記性可眞有點不好了。）</p>
<p>（記性並不差呢，必是————）他説着，停了一停，摇着腦袋，（必是多喝了點酒。）</p>
<p>説完了，他抬起眼皮來人，可是那個人却像釘着他年前買進來的一頂花帽，對於他的話一點也没有注意。</p>
<p>他故意歪斜着身子，撞到那個人的身上，又重複着一句：</p>
<p>（昨天，我多喝點酒！）</p>
<p>（啊，老爹，怪不得您醉成這麽個樣子，眞要是跌下去倒有點麻煩呢！）</p>

<h3 id="c262">短波發射機述要（一） <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 黄鑑村</p>
<p>（一）短波發射機槪要</p>
<p>目下我無綫電界所採用之發射機（Transnitler）,除去陳舊貨船或學校中尚用火花式（Spark　type）者外，大都均採用眞空管式者。考眞空管之發射方式，約可分爲下列兩大類。</p>
<p>（一）自勵式發射機　（二）他勵式（電力放大式）　真空管控制　晶體控制</p>
<p>所謂自勵式者（Self　Oscillator　System）係以一種振盪用眞空管自身使天綫振盪者，大抵小電力發射機多採用之。業餘家之發射機，雖多屬於此種發射方式，然因防止發射週率及輸出之變化，頗爲困難，故亦漸被廢止，以致數瓦特之小電力者，亦多有採用電力放大式之傾向。</p>
<p>電力放大方式又分兩種：一種以小型眞空管振盪器或昌體控制振盪器爲基礎，而以基本高週率之原狀，漸次依眞空管放大者；另一種乃將高調波吸收（Pick　up）而漸次擴大電力者。在短波方面，大多採用後者之方法，而大電力發射機之全部，槪屬此法。</p>
<p>無綫電通訊上，發射機地位之重要，固不待言，而一般應具條件之不可不先行考慮者，則有左列二種：</p>
<p>（一）高週率之安定（二）音調之良好</p>
<p>高週率之不安定，能妨害其他之通信，固不待言，固不待言，而欲本電台之通信完滿舉行，事實上亦非可能。然在使振盪高週率安定，現在舍使用晶體外，尚無其他善法。此外對於其他設備等等應加以注意，尤應嚴重防止其變動，於是國際的恊定在所必行也。</p>
<p>音色之良否，對於通訊速度，或混音之除去等，亦大有關係。吾人最渴望之音色，乃所謂純直流（P.D.C.）者，因其能發出澄澈清晣之音，故若此間混有少量之雜音或與不純音色之信號相接近時，亦至易分離也。</p>
<p>眞空管之所以能作振盪器使用者，乃全起因於其放大特性。如將眞空管放大器之配諧輸出電路與輸入電路交連之、卽輸出電路電流之變化，雖能歸還輸入電路，然因再次放大作用之故，振幅亦被擴大，而輸出電路之電壓，亦必達至某一定之限度。但如超過此種狀態，則呈振盪作用，故由外部縱不加入任何電壓，而此電路自身，亦必繼續發生振盪。在眞空管振盪器，通常均以栅極方面爲輸入電路，而以屏極方面爲輸出電路。</p>
<h3 id="c263">衰落在收音機内 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>收音機接收遠地音訊，聲浪忽高忽低，此種現象，在無綫電學上稱爲衰落。（Ｆading）</p>
<p>衰落的原因，據一般無綫電專家研究的結果，説是：由於天波互相干擾所致。原來無綫電波在發射機上的天綫輸出後，一部分沿地面前進，稱爲地波：（Ground　Wave）一部分直射天空，稱爲天波（Sky　Wave）。地波自發射處循地面遞至接收處，牠的距離，是一定不變的。天波傳至接收處則全仗空中海氏層（Heaviside　Laver）爲之反射。但海氏層與地面之距離時常變動，（距離約自一百哩至二百哩）因之，天波打程之長短，亦隨之轉移。不變的地波，與常有變化的天波相遇，忽爲同相，（InPhase）忽爲異相。（Out　of　Phase）在同相時，天地波彼此相助，音訊自然强大；在異相時，天地波相推，音訊當然减低，甚至湮没無聞！</p>
<p>據經騐和事實告訴我們，有時外來電波的强弱，並無變化，但是收到的音訊，却依舊高低不一，這便不能不令人轉移目標，歸咎於收音機本身的不妥善了。</p>
<p>的確，收音機裝置不良或是内部有何損壞，也會使收到的音訊高低不一的。下面所説的，便是最普通的幾點；</p>
<p>（一）天地綫使用日久，繞接處已鬆脱。</p>
<p>（二）天綫本身太髮，隨風飄蕩，時與外界通地物（如大樹，屋瓦等）接觸。</p>
<p>（三）眞空管設計不良，或使用日久，陰極電子放射失常，屏流亦隨之不穏定。——此類眞空管，有時必須燃至一定的時間後，纔失常態，單憑眞空管較準器（Tube　Checker）短時的測騐，往往不易覺察。所以，碰到這種情形，假如手頭有現成的眞空管，還是以更換新管爲妙。</p>
<p>（四）傍路或濾波電容器漏電——這是收音機内發生衰落現象，最大的原因。摩登收音機，容積甚小，開放時機内熱度極高，空氣流動的地位，更是微乎其微。這樣，設計較差的電容器，自然格外容易損壞。特别是風行一時的電糊式（Dry　Electrolytic　Condensei）電容器，遇到高温度時，影響更大。不過此類電容器，在尋常户内温度時試騐之，却又十分完善。所以萬一遇到此種情形，還是同上法，更換新貨爲妙。不過調換時，在未曾斷定那一隻電容器，確有損壞前，不必將原有的逐一拆下，祗要將牠接通地綫的一頭截斷便可。</p>
<p>此外，因爲各種變壓器，低週率阻流綫圈，或是揚聲器等設計不善，鐵心時常飽和；（Saturation）以及次等炭質電阻數值的不穏定等等，也會變動收音機輸出的音量。這裏，爲了篇幅的關係，不再贅述。總之，裝置收音機，如果要得到良好的成績，劣貨，最好能絶對的避免使用。</p>
<h3 id="c264">中間週率放大之設計要點 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>無極外差式收音機，所以能較優於調整高週率式的原由，卽因多添中間週率放大一部份，所謂中間週率，其範圍極廣，大約可自IooKC５００KC，設計中間週率放大級時，必先决定一恰當的週率，選擇標準，第一，須能避免本地强力長波電台訊號之直接採取，第二，週率務求其低，使能得較好的放大力，但亦不可過低，致混入成音範圍，最後因眞空管用作放大時，其特性曲綫决不能成眞眞的直綫，所以雖輸入的訊號電壓，爲純粹正弦曲綫，放大後亦必爲之失眞，而産生倍週率（Harmonic）此倍週率如適在廣播範圍内，將重復諭入收音機而生騷擾，根據以上三點，廣播收音機最適宜的中間週率，當爲１７５ＫＣ，其二次倍週率３５０ＫＣ及三次５２５ＫＣ，又能均不在廣播帶内，舶來收音機之中間週率級，幾無有不採用此週率的，至短波機通常以４４５ＫＣ至４６５ＫＣ爲最適宜的標準。</p>
<p>１７５ＫＣ的四次倍週率７００ＫＣ，以及高至八次倍週率，仍在廣播帶内，雖極微弱，亦能使收音機生意想不到的障碍，所以中間週率級的調整綫路及眞空管等，必須一一隔離妥密。</p>
<p>中間週率放大級的眞空管，最好採用四極簾栅管或强力高放管之類，如３５及７８號等，因此類眞空管，可得較高的放大力。</p>
<p>中間週率放大部份，級數的多少，須視其所需要的放大力而定，可依下式求之：　　　　　需要放大力=檢波級所需激勵壓——————————高週率放大級輸出電壓</p>
<p>例如檢波管栅極所需要的激勵電壓爲４Ｖ（Ｒ.M.S.），訊號經高週率級放大後爲.3V,輸入中間週率級，則中間週率放大部份需要的放大力爲１３３.3Ｖ，如僅以一級中間週率欲得如此强的放大力，自屬不可能，故必須分爲二級，使每級約爲６５Ｖ，或分爲三級，每級４４Ｖ均可。</p>
<h3 id="c265">眞空管之新用途 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 範羣</p>
<p>眞空管爲無綫電之主腦固毋容贅言，但現今其用途，幾可施之於任何技術上。如地質學家用以探礦，化學家用以改良其提煉方法，機械工程師用以控制機件，實業家用以檢騐物品等，不勝枚舉。本篇略述其兩種新用途。　　　　（一）用眞空管以測定長度（Length）長度當以直接度量爲最簡便。其長度極短，則非另用他法不可。例如有薄板一塊，兩端置於水平支架上，共中叚因自身重量而有相當陷落（Desletion）。若另加重量於於板上，則其陷落必因之而增加。設或此重量等於蒼蠅之體重，則所增加之陷落，共長度幾爲人眼所不能辨。但可用眞空管以測定之。其法係利用兩振盪管之扑擊現象（Beat　Phenomena）。將此所增加之陷落，以改變一電容器兩金屬片之距離。而此電容器，係用以控制甲振盪管之週率者也。另有一乙振盪管，其週率與甲之原來週率完全相同，例如爲１０，０００週率。若甲之週率因其電容器兩金屬片間之距離减少１０.７cm（其長僅爲一原子之直徑之十倍）而變化，則甲乙兩管可以每秒鐘發生唸（Beat）一次。此種唸之次數，當易於檢察之。吾人可利用此原理，以檢查銅絲抽作時，其斷面直徑是否正確。將壓榨銅絲之滾軸，設法與甲管電容器之可動片相連接。倘絲之直徑小於或大於一定限度時，則其因唸所生之電流，可以觸動機件，使停止工作。其他類似此種工作，皆可設法控制之。</p>
<p>（二）用眞空管以測定時間時間之測定，爲物理學上重要工作之一。但擺動標準鐘之擺捶，常因温度之變遷而致影響其長度。因此鐘之精確程度亦時常更動。但石英振盪器之週率，與温度變化極小。倘用羅曾格式（Lozenge|shaped）之石英片，每攝氏一度僅變更百萬分之一的週率。美國倍耳電話研究室馬利生（Marrison）氏，利用此點，創製一石英控制鐘（Quartz　Clock）其精確較最佳之擺動鐘有過之無不及。其基本電路如第一圖所示，乃一十萬週率之石英控制振盪器，備有輸出電路三處，俾得接至此鐘之各機件。與石英平接之電容器Ｃ，可以改變週率小至一萬萬分之一週波，但時針之轉動，决非十萬週之電流所能爲力。因此需用分除發電機（Submultiple　Generator），以産生低週率電流。習知兩振盪器交連時，有甚顯著之同步（Syncbronisin）作用。倘有一富有倍波（Harmonics）之不穏定振盪器，其主波週率約爲一萬，與此十萬週率之石英控制振盪器相交連，則前者之第十倍波（TenchHarmonic，），與後者同步，而前者之屏電路中之主波，亦必恰爲一萬週率，其穏定性與十萬週率者，初無二致，若另有一富有倍波之不穏定振盪器，其主波爲一千週率，與此一萬者相交連，則此一千週率振盪器之第十次倍波，將與一萬週率者相同步，因此吾人可得一振盪穏定，週率爲一千之電流。再利用此一千週率之電波，以轉動一同步電動機（SynchronsusMotor），在其軸上，裝有１００週率及１０週率之發電機各一具，由是則時針轉動所需之低週率電波，得以發生。且具週率之穏定，與石英控制之十萬週率發振盪器相若。天文學家嘗謂此鐘再經相當之改進，則每日地球轉所需時間之差誤，亦得以測定之。</p>

<p>— 一知</p>
<p>我們倘有陳舊而不用的鋁質變量電容器，則可將牠製成一具電液電容器，怎樣製法呢？將一只鋁質變量電容器，拆下鋁片（若爲動片組的，則仍將動片組的疊成一組；若爲固定片組的，則仍將定片組的疊成一組；每組皆能製成一具電液電容器）在每片邊緣，鑽四小孔，片與片間用木襯圈（玻璃襯圈則更佳）夾之，使不相接觸；乃用鋁綫四根穿過各片小孔，引上至片外，將四鋁綫絞成一束，使鋁片合成一組，置在鋁杯中，惟此用鋁綫合組成的鋁片，周圍須用絶緣器隔絶，使不與鋁板接觸。</p>
<p>電液電容器做到這樣後，乃配合下列混合液以灌入。</p>
<p>甘油１００公分</p>
<p>硼酸６２公分</p>
<p>阿摩尼亞水５０竔或２６％</p>
<p>灌入液後，須以直流電壓充製，使鋁片生出極化作用，當接片生出極化作用，當接直流電壓充製時，裂漏電流Leakage　Cnrrent甚大，故必先串接一耗阻器，使得適當電流；而供給電源的器，不負荷過高而致損壞，待電容器的鋁片表面漸生極性表皮，則見電流徐徐减小；乃將耗阻器值漸漸减低，至移去爲止，若裂减電流已至最小限度，則此電液電容器已製成了，電液電容器所充制的直流電壓最多以四百伏脱爲止，所用的電壓愈低，則電容量愈高，鋁罐爲陰極，接出的鋁綫爲陽極。（完）</p>

<p>苗中婦女，亦能績苧織布，淮其機矮，席地而織成之布，則極堅厚耐久也。</p>
<p>苗民於耕織之外，惟事牧畜，故苗中牛馬犬羊豕猫雞鴨之類最多，而苗民蓄牛，不任耕種，但供口腹，資貿易而已。</p>
<p>苗中農具，有犁耙鋤鐮長柄刀斧，籮筐背籠背枷桔橰筒車，織具有機梭紡車蠶筐，食具有鼎鍋釜鐺碗箸杓盂，服具有項圈手釧網巾衣服，器用有升斗戥秤剪刀針錐尺梳櫛碓磨，雜器，械具有火槍桿子環刀弓弩兜鍪皮甲，樂具有鑼鼓號頭，蘆笙畫角腰鼓鐃鈸之屬，皆自爲之，而能通其用也。</p>
<p>苗民入市，與民交易，驅牛馬，負土物，如雜糧布絹諸類，以趨集塲，糧以四小碗爲一升，布以兩手一度爲四尺，牛馬以拳數多寡，定價值，其法將竹篾箍牛前肋，定其寛側，然後以　量行篾，水牛至十六拳爲大，黄牛至十三拳爲大，名曰拳牛，不論者少也，至馬則論老少，以木棍比至放鞍處，從地數起，高至十三拳爲大，齒少拳多，價差昻，反是者爲劣，名曰比馬，苗民大率以雜糧布絹牛馬，與土人易鹽易蠶種易器具云。</p>
<p>苗寨中亦有自爲易者，惟富苗放賬於窮苗，其息甚大，錢一千，榖一石，三年加息至數倍，不能償，則折以山地衣服各項，窮苗雖受其盤剝，而仰以爲生，故亦無可如何，蓋旣折山地之後，無地耕種，必將所折山地，轉求佃耕地，然旣佃耕之後，惟聽富苗役使，生死惟命，故率以打寃家，無不從者，蓋苗民輕生好鬥，睚眦之隙動輒釀酒椎牛，邀集親黨，執械穴鬥，名打寃家。</p>
<p>豹子塲正大營附近苗寨，頗有在大途傍開店貿易者，黔楚客民，販牛經過，投宿其家，亦與外間逆旅無異，且知敬客民薪水以及住宿，而取值甚廉，無盤剝客民之習，客或早行，邀其相送，則持矛槍，護至數十里，遇他寨苗伏草，作苗語招號之，伏草苗即不敢犯，如伏草苗不退，輒挺矛與鬥，名曰護客。</p>

<p>（砲手張）是一二八抗日戰史中，一個無名英雄，他是山東人，姓張，隸屬於第五軍帳下，祗充當一名上士兵，因爲精於瞄準射擊，同伍弟兄都以（砲手張）喚他。在戰雲瀰漫，槍聲密接的某一個早晨，敵軍氣熖甚盛，向我猛攻。這不要説，他們在飛機掩護下作戰，必又佔了優勢。我軍雖然器械不精，又無飛機掩護，但是軍心很堅固，爲義憤所軀使，就毫不遲疑畏縮，迎頭接戰上去。其時北站還未失守。砲手張所隸的砲兵營本部，臨時就設在火車站。大砲也架在其上，他們這一營係採取游擊式，奉命助戰。當我漸現不支之勢，忽聞砲聲隆隆，起於背後，敵人的陣脚，竟不攻自亂，空氣旣已變更，我們的士氣自然大振，原來砲手張發出的砲彈，三之二皆中了敵人的要害。這一次接戰，其結果，我軍於一髮千鈞中，反敗爲勝，皆屬砲手張的蓋世奇功。</p>
<p>其後每日晨興，或是夜間，張在車上，必要發砲十數響，以辭敵人的軍心，幾乎視爲常課。駐守於華租交界地方之英美軍人，每遥見之，很佩服他的暇豫精神。所以當日各西文報紙，對於他莫不贊揚備至。有人説：一二八之後，北站所以能够守了三十一天，雖然是將士不屈，拼命的抵禦，而最大原因，的確還要歸功於砲手張。敵人膽量素小，處處皆以聲勢奪，尤不堪肉搏。對於砲手張之砲彈，竟畏懼到萬分，而且他們聽官很敏鋭，在我方祇要是張所發出的砲，他們都能測騐得出，并有蚅大的證明，就是我軍中旁人發出的砲彈，降落之後，絶不似砲手張之無情。在一霎眼間，青烟過處，能令敵人的屍身，七横八豎！</p>

<p>在上海的印度阿三。十個之中，至少有五個以上，是除了正當的職業之外，兼營着重利盤剝的放債事業的。他們放債的利息，普通都是每元每月一角，而且還要先扣一月利息。那便是説。向印度阿三處借債一百元，實際到手是九十元，滿了一月，須十足還洋一百元。若是借了一百元，過了四個月，本利清償，便非一百三十三元不可。</p>
<p>印度阿三雖然會説上海話，但是不識中國字，所以借票大率都是印度阿三自已繕就，借債者在借票上打一個手印就行了。但是印度阿三放債，借票上所寫的數目，往往是比了借債者所借到手的要大上五倍。借五十元的，總是塡二百五十元。有的索性命債户在一張白紙上打一個手印就算了。一旦債户要賴債時，印度阿三便會自己寫上一個數目，上法院去控告。</p>
<p>印度阿三的正當職業，大率都是巡捕與司閽之類。此輩雖然薪給僅三四十元一月，但却没一個不是節衣縮食，每月省下三五元來，重利盤剝飲鴆止渴而不圖上進的我們中國的貴同胞。所以某國人説，印度人是阿三，支那人是阿四。</p>

<p>▲商化教育　北平大學生組織職業運動大同盟），和南京中大史學系畢業生（趙萬青）的自殺，露骨地昭示我們中國的教育尚未正確！以我國最高學府畢業的大學生，畢業後還是不能謀得相當的職業，其他因無力深造的高初中畢業生，其求職業的困難，當然更凄慘可想了。於是一班辦教育的專家，瞧風勢不順，又在預備創什麽生産數育，生計教育，生活教育了。這三種教育實施以後，能不能打破現在這（畢業即失業）的破産，教育的危局，固然還是疑問，不過以歷來文縐縐的教育家，要希望他立地能改變作風，變做躬執耙鋤的老農夫，總還是一樁滑稽而懷疑的事情！可是學校對於學生收費方面，却竭盡其搜刮之能事，在招考之初，先收報名費一元，這一筆費，起先原爲限止學生投考兒戲起見，有不取發還的，可是現在却無論取與不取，一槪没收，至於考取以後，在學費及膳宿費外，還有種種附加的苛捐雜税。現在舉幾樁學校中最普通的附加費如下：（健身房費），（建築費），（實習費），（圖書費），（醫藥費），（賠償費），（制服費），（燈水費），而正當的書籍費，尚不在内，一個學生附加的苛雜，至少已在十種左右，而臨時發生事故的費用，猶不在内。學校當局簡實把學校當做經營的商店，終日在金錢上打算，莫怪無暇再顧及學生的出路問題了。所以我以爲在這提倡生産教育的時代，第一須先注意進種商化教育的學校！</p>

<h3 id="c300">希特勒末日至矣 <a href="#c300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>最近美國星相家在芝加哥舉行年會，（研究天文）之戈登博士，向其同業宣示預言，稱德意志獨裁之刧運已難挽回，（希特勒之末日至矣），此蓋天數，在希特勒呱呱墮地之時早已註定也。并云據天象所招示，世界各國行將大亂，獨俄得偏安耳。</p>
<p>以（研究天文）而博士之戈登，竟與星相相合流，且對此國際形勢與世界政治要人的興衰成敗大算其（八字），一則曰生前註定，再則曰天象招示，我們除了感歎現社會科學的發達，以至用以解釋（神）的意旨之没落現象外，同時也應認識這些（巫師邪教）企圖披上科學的外衣來出現，其對科學完全是（有辱斯文）。不過戈登氏關於（希特勒末日至矣）的推測，或有成爲事實的可能，只是所持的理由，則不是甚麽（天象招示），而是根據於目前德國的實際。</p>
<p>希特勒的得秉政權，是在國内革命危機深刻，經濟恐慌，對外政策困難的環境下，開了無數空頭支票，獲得一些小布爾的中間層（如挺進隊）的擁戴，跑上總理的位置的，這些支票在全世界經濟恐慌均無出路，與各列强間已醖釀（重分天下）的大戰時，自然是絲毫不能兌現。在對外關係上説罷，修改凡爾賽條約，要求軍備平等，首先就遇着英法方面的阻礙，再如何狺狺而去的退出國聨，也不見有何等效力。轉而向東發展，收回走廊地帶（但澤），與想得俄屬烏克蘭作殖民地的要求，迎頭的碰着波蘭政府的反杭，和李特維諾夫的痛擊。威尼斯與墨索里尼的會談、失望而回；最近奥國國社黨的叛亂，也没有實現德奥合併的理想，雖其黨已將陶爾非斯致死，但却引起意大利陳兵阿爾俾斯山，一再宣稱維護奥大利的獨立。凡此一切，都使希特勒甚麽第三帝國日爾曼民族光榮一串的民族宣傳武器，弄得處處向隅，在在碰壁。</p>
<p>至於對内呢，（卓别麟鬍子）走馬上任之時，是一再宣言以解决失業挽救經濟危機爲職志的。可是國内經濟狀况非獨未能轉好，且每况愈下，如國民總收入的减少，必須品消費額的低落，二年中現全儲存縮减七倍等，都是事實。失業人數雖稍减少，但并非希特勒復興經濟的結果，而爲驅除猶太人，將婦女趕回家庭所致。我們統計希氏一兩年來的政績，彷彿只有奬勵生殖與消滅生殖機能是他的（功德）。</p>
<p>這些事件，必然就使以前擁護希特勒的（中間層），因口惠而實不至，便日益失望，對希氏加反對，挺進隊的醖釀政變，卽含此意。因此逼迫希特勒轉而向自己（親信部隊）開刀，投降到國防軍方面去。這説明德國的政府，已放棄對小布爾（中間層）的欺騙，露骨的倒入金融財政巨頭的懷裏。然而純粹金融財政巨頭的統治，能够解决德國對外政策推翻凡爾賽條約，内部的經濟危機麽？絶對不能。牠反而使一般人民認清萬字旗統治的面目、趨於激烈，以變亂來推翻現在統治，彼星相家之言，殆亦由此推摹得之耳。</p>
<h3 id="c301">從積榖説到民食及其他 <a href="#c301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>吾國素來對於（積榖防荒）之舉是向不重視的，平常總是隨種隨吃，毫不儲藏；年成熟了，將榖價拚命的狂賤暴跌，使農民有損無益，又畸形的促成了農村經濟的破産，農民生機亦瀕於絶境。年歲荒了，任意將米價提高，一般奸商又以奇貨可居，閉倉不開。一旦遇到大荒之年臨頭，便不得不臨渴掘井，手足失措，不得已祗得向國外去購辦洋米，以救饑荒。吾號稱以農立國之中國，竟料不到每年有大量洋米之輸入，這不可謂不可憐了！反觀之蕞爾日本，在數十年前尚須向吾國購米，而不到三十年，他們每年都有大量之米向國外求售，他們農業的突飛猛進，眞堪驚人！吾談着民食，便想起友人吳君對吾談起，日人統制下的傀儡國人民生活狀况，裏面有一段是關於僞國之民食問題，現在也摘錄在下面，也可見得僞國民食問題的一斑。</p>
<p>日前，吾遇到被商務書館派赴東北考察歸來的吳君，告訴了吾好些僞國的印像。吾問他處在日人鐵蹄下的東北同胞生活情形，據他説：東省民衆眞苦，他們耕種了田，自己却連米粒也没上口的，收割了稻，榖子須完全賣給國家，因爲僞國已設立了個大規模的積榖倉，預備屯糧；卽使有米多餘，亦要售給别國的。如國内人民欲吃米者，則每石須四十元左右；所以這裏的民衆所吃的只有大麥飯，或玉蜀黍粉和𫃫糠荳類等，米飯是絶對也没有吃的。有的，祗有那些大富之家和高貴的人們。</p>
<p>他們這種舉動，至少有兩種用意：（一）積榖防荒，使民衆吃慣雜糧；提高米價，卽是鼓勵農業發展，促進墾荒，增加農業生産額；就是一年，二年，三年，遇到荒年，亦容易應付，决不致於斷絶糧種，而發生食糧恐慌。（二）屯糧備戰，他們是武力迷夢的國家，時時在渴望着戰端的啟發，假使將來不幸一旦戰機暴發，則軍糧民食，都是何等的重要？苟不及早未雨綢繆，將來未免要臨時慌張。他們對於本國如此，而對於彼一手包辦，而視爲生命綫之僞滿何獨不然？此種熟謀深思，近憂遠慮的精神，誠不能不使人驚嘆！</p>
<p>然而吾國是怎樣？别説是屯糧，便是積榖也根本没有這末一回事的。因此，祗要遇到一年災荒，便没法可想了！回顧豫陜甘三省，慘目傷心之災象圖，固猶歷歷在目，哀鴻遍野，餓殍載道，令人不忍卒覩，偶一回憶，不禁不寒而慄！</p>

<p>— 紅茶</p>
<p>好久以前，就知道自己是有肺病的了。胡亂吃點現成藥似爾好些，最近吐血了，方纔知道自己的病，并不輕，連忙去檢查，果然，右肺尖已得有一個空洞。於是就把一切該做的事情抛掉，鎭天的儍玩儍睡。</p>
<p>本來自己的身體，一向很弱，小時候一連幾年的中藥，越發淘登壞。自然，成積也不是没有的，到現在爲止，我還是無論怎樣苦，怎樣難吃的藥，總够不縐一縐眉頭呷下去。</p>
<p>因爲病得多了，凡是病中的一切，都有很深的體騐。現在隨便寫一點在下　，以消寂寞。</p>
<p>説句不怕臉紅的話，我是很歡喜小病的。因爲在小病中，你能够儘量的享受人世的温情。記得在家裏的時候，每是舊歷的三四月，總要害一次病。那時，在我們江邨，正是風景清美的時候，無論何是誰，——甚至像我那已經有很多子女，家事又很煩重的母親，在綿長的下午，總也到小園中轉轉，或則從籬笆中望望紅綠的原野。雖則歸來時常常帶有一二聲輕微的嘆息，覺得人世太艱辛，但是，生氣是充滿着的。自從我病了以後，母親就整天的陪着我很少出去。不過，當我睡着的時候，她總還是出去看看。這時候，弟妹已經支使開了，她總是一個人到小園裏轉一轉立刻就回來。回來時，我自然還没醒。於是她再默默的坐着待我醒來。我一醒之後，她就慢慢的告訴我小園裏，那一邊一叢草花開了，是紫色的，那一邊一朶什麽花落了，每一樣都是我没病時留心着。於是我開始知道母親的偉大。她是無論那一個時候，總是留心着孩子們留心些什麽。雖則在她已經没有簡單留心一叢草花的閑情。</p>
<p>至於弟妹們，那是更可懷念的，他們更爲受了母親的囑付不到我的房裏，但是每日當他們最想到我的時候，他們總是輕輕的站在房門口，圓睜着黑寳石似的眼睛，看着坐着的母親，和躺着的我。這時候母親總是微笑着點點頭，於是他們就輕手輕脚的跑到我的床前來，看着，不説話，一回兒又出去了。有時候他們䁥着母親不在房裏的時候，溜進來，這時候，他們多半帶着東西給我。最有趣的，我那最小的弟弟，他有一次拿一個玻璃瓶，盛着水和兩個蝌蚪給我，當時我的喜悦是很難説出的。</p>
<p>病中最怕是下雨天，下雨天，不但氣壓很低，使你感到沉悶，同時那雨聲也會使你感到寂寞，感到悲哀。自然天晴是容易使小病的人，想到外邊的風景而不安，同時，窗上嗡嗡的野蜂，也會呌得你心癢，但是假使你能够從臥着而改爲坐起，從窗中望望外面的和風麗日，你的心都會感到輕鬆。</p>
<p>此外，小病是能很使人深思。從蒼蠅一直到宇宙，無一樣不容許你慢慢的想，同時，也决没有人來攪亂你的思潮、有許多不病的時候，認爲不必想的事物，在病中常常會想出和你直覺理解完全查反的理由來。（小病是能够使人正確些！）我常常這樣主張。</p>
<p>至於小病能够使你不幹許多不願幹的事，不見許多小願見的人，是每一個人都知道的，就是這點，小病已經够你讚美的了。</p>

<p>— 秋月</p>
<p>一　人生的旅程旅程</p>
<p>假如人生的旅程是那鳥語花香，則你，孤獨者啊！你有如走着沙漠一樣之荒凉。</p>
<p>人們會同其所愛，笑語輕盈地走上人生之長路：春天，喃呢的燕子，會告訴他童年的故事。夏天，樅林樹上的知了，唱着愛之Lullaby，還有那冬天的白雪，是加增他們爐邊愛情的絮語。秋天的落葉，更會便他們於年華之珍惜。</p>
<p>然而你。孤獨者啊！你孤孤冷冷地。也過着是這樣的四季麽？</p>
<p>你是：在廣寒的沙漠中，你懷着鉛塊的沉重底心，你踏着疲乏的沉重之步調，踽踽獨行。你從夏等到秋，從冬等到春，你到底是爲着什麽呀！。</p>
<p>你是：在此踽踽的獨行中，孤獨者啊！你信念着會找到一片浩淼的綠洲麽？</p>
<p>二　永遠的旅人</p>
<p>作個永遠的旅人，去吧！背上包袱，携着大布傘，拖着沉重之脚步，徜徉於縹不可知的地平綫，走到世界遼遠底盡頭：</p>
<p>將生命寄托與大自然，讓生涯消磨於旅程上。夕浴於清風明月之繁露，朝餐着四季芬馨之粲英。鴟梟給你作着將導，夜鶯伴你歌唱聲聲。——從此，你踏前着匀整之步調，望着遼遠的前程，踽踽獨行。</p>
<p>於是，你則眷戀於秋月之皎潔，向天邊低徊密語，你愛着秋蟲之蛩鳴，有如嫠婦之低泣嚶嚶。——從此，白雲靉靆的山頭，遥遠遼闊的雲天，就是你底故鄉呀，你底永遠憧憬懷念之童年－</p>
<p>從此，歲月時辰正悠悠，將任你的足跡走遍天涯：或東或西或南或北地飄流。崑崙山頭有你狂歌之音波，地中海涯有你行吟曾經過；任你瞻望金字塔之雄姿，任你憑弔耶露賽冷之往事：</p>
<p>去吧！背上包袱，携着大布傘，作個永遠的旅人。</p>

<h3 id="c306">好萊塢防止綁匪的工作（上） <a href="#c306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— 文影</p>
<p>最近綁票恐嚇之復熾　　各方合作撲滅的加緊</p>
<p>居住好萊塢的一個煤油富翁，名葛德爾的，不久以前被綁匪綁了去。這就是好萊塢綁票風氣重行猖獗的徴兆。一般明星們，重新又起了惴惴不安的恐慌。就是鎭靜如嘉買，素來恃猛犬爲護衛的，現在亦開始僱用了幾個保鏢的。許多明星又重新受到了匪徒們的嚇詐。其中如安哈婷，瑪琳黛德麗許，梅蕙絲德，平克勞斯貝，和康絲登斯本湼等，都已收到了許多恐嚇信件。梅蕙絲德因爲失去了貴重的珍飾，被匪徒勒令不許上法庭做見證，否則將受（毁容）的懲罰。許多的恐嚇事件已經很迅速地私自了結了，因爲明星們中，有許多是怕事的，有許多是手頭散漫的。付掉幾千塊錢，保障保障一己或家室的安全，又何必多較量呢？</p>
<p>但是據好萊塢警察方面的見解，此後不能再有驚人的綁票鉅案發生了。因爲防禦的週全，影片公司和影星們的通力合作，好萊塢已成爲綁匪們可望而不可即的地點了。葛德爾被綁後，前後不過六天的功夫，竟被好萊塢的警察破案了。葛德爾不費分文地被救了出來。綁匪被逮而被判决終身監禁了。葛德爾案是好萊塢警察當局能力的試金石，亦是好萊塢一般電影明星們命運之所繫。他住的地方，是在皮佛山麓，那裏明星們别墅接一連二的排列着。他們亦都和這位富翁很熟悉的。所以自從他被綁之後，一般明星們别墅接一連二的排列着。他們候他們自己家裏人回來一樣。他們想，要是綁匪勝利了，得到了鉅額的贖欵，而逍遥法外了，那末第二個被綁的將是誰？綁匪的勢力，是否已仲張到不可撲滅的程度，以及好萊塢地方當局，究竟有無保護明星們的實力？後來葛德爾居然不損毫髮的安然歸來了，全好萊塢都受到了一種哄動。明星們都跑到葛德爾房子前，高聲歡呼慶視，而葛德爾房子前的一片草地，立時就成了一個民衆大會的地方。洛桑磯檢察長費資，警察長台維斯，和偵探長别斯蓋爾資等三人，就成了臨時的民族英雄，到處受人歡呼。費資氏並自當衆演説好萊塢對於明星們保護的週密，勸大衆不必擔憂。現在我們且把費資演説的大槪紀之於下：</p>
<p>（這當然是好萊塢應當慶祝的一件事。好萊塢是明星們聚集之所、也是美國全國匪徒最覬觎的地方。他們想一般電影明星們，每星期的薪水，高到五六千元，他們一定是很付得起贖欵的了。况且一般綁匪，無疑的也是明星們的崇拜者，他們更無庸去化錢買通路線。還有一點，這些明星正在拍影片的時候，突然給匪徒綁去了，影片公司亦情願出鉅額的贖欵，去保全明星們的生命的，因爲公司裏已經化了許多錢，影片已經拍了一半，倘使明星不出來，他們以前所已放下去的資本勢將全歸烏有也。以上都是匪徒們覬觎好萊塢一般電影明星的原因。）</p>
<p>但是據費資氏的見解，綁明星們亦有許多困難之處。第一，明星們是衆人所認得的，藏匿和運送，都有困難。明星們是工作和交際都很煩重的，時時刻刻有人尋訪他們，所以他們要是被綁失踪了，在一二十分鐘以内，一定就有人要發覺追問的。要是普通的商人，往往失踪之後，隔了幾個鐘點，還没有人知道，這是與明星們不同的。因此綁匪們的手法，一定要敏捷乾凈，一分一秒鐘都不能虚擲。這是一定要有極完備的組織，和胆識兼人的匪徒，才可以從事於好萊塢的綁票事業的。還有好萊塢地方當局對於一般明星們保護的週密、更使一般匪徒有望洋興歎之感。現在我們再聽聽費資氏所講的防止綁匪行爲的種種布置。（未完）影片談評</p>

<p>— 胡越</p>
<p>Tomorrow　At　Seven　　－大上海映</p>
<p>（刀光血影）是和一般的偵探片一樣，凑巧，偶然，矯揉造作，牽强附會，以及人物個性描寫的缺乏，都和其他的偵探片同樣的有着這些通病。</p>
<p>（刀光血影）雖也有一般偵探片所有的曲折離奇的結構，和出人意外的結果，但是，導演處理的不善，恐怖的緊張的空氣的欠缺，連一般偵探片本身所應有的效果也没有獲得的。</p>
<p>“Tomorrow　at　Seven”之前的緊張，導演可以用種種的恐怖，把觀衆的情緒緊張起來，到了七時的這一個頂點，也可以因着導演的縝密的佈置（而給予觀衆以一般偵探片所能給予的刺激。</p>
<p>但是，（刀光血影）的導演是没有很好的抓住這幾點的。</p>
<p>當中國電影還在幼稚的時代，曾記得也有過揷刀留柬的偵探片子出現，然而這種幼稚的淺薄的偵探片，早已被時代所抛棄了。</p>
<p>但是，在若干年後的今日，美國的雷電華公司竟也會把這種幼稚的題材搬上銀幕，劇作者的淺薄和無聊，也就顯而可見了。</p>
<p>這種影片，將必然地和西部影片一樣，不爲站在時代前面的觀衆們所歡迎吧。</p>

<p>— 馥</p>
<p>桃樂賽黛兒的死耗，本刊已經紀載過，惟語焉不詳，現在再來補充一下。桃樂賽黛兒（Dorothy　Dell）是愛爾卡洛爾（Earl　Carroll）所選爲影界十六最美麗的女子之一。其實，她亦可以説是好萊塢最美的人了，因爲她的體態，非但在好萊塢可佔首席，卽在世界無論什麽地方，恐怕亦少有她的對手。她在十五歲的時候，就榮膺了（美國小姐）的頭銜，不久就晋授了（宇宙小姐）的尊號。她未入影界之前，在百老匯歌舞界，早已蜚聲一時。她來到好萊塢不過半年之久，派拉蒙已在考慮升她作爲明星，不幸汽車出事，她和汽車的駕駛人，先後數小時之内慘死了。她的駕駛人華格臬博士（Dr　Carl　Wagner）是好萊塢鄰近巴塞鄧那的一位醫生，在社交界交是一位知名之士，他們在巴塞鄧那宴會告終之後，華格臬就親自駕車送她回去。不意在中途轉折之處，華氏偶一不愼，失了把握，車子就猛撞在電綫桿上。桃樂賽立時身死，而華格臬亦頭骨破碎，抬到醫院後，六小時身故。這是六月七日夜中之事。派拉蒙對於桃樂賽黛兒之死，莫不同聲惋惜，因爲她上升之速，如果不死的話，她到現在早已可以成爲一位燦爛的明星了。</p>

<p>大約在兩星期以前吧，在申新兩報的戲目欄中，登載着一幅關於（漁光曲）的廣的，寥寥數字，頗爲觸目，當時金城戲院疑是聨華送登的，而聨華則疑是金城送登的；不料次日兩造當面一問，竟都不是，他們就打電話到報館去查問，據説是一個不認得的男子。拿了現欵，把稿子送來刊登了，姓名住址，連得報館裏也不知其詳；並且花錢很多，一張廣告，計洋五十四元四角，於是這件事情，就成了疑案了，最近鄙人始於無意中，探出送登義務廣告的朋友，是南市裏鹹瓜街葆大參號一位姓金的，據他説生平最喜歡看聨華影片，而這（漁光曲）更適合他的口味，他曾連看九次之多，他和金城及聨華，可説是毫無關係，這一次的送登廣告，完全是爲一種愛護（漁光曲）的心理所驅使，並無其他作用，這個疑團，方才打破，像金君這樣的影迷，可以算得熱心了。</p>

<p>— 草時</p>
<p>埃第與勞雷急於要找一處安全的地方去藏匿那珠串。無綫電－花瓶－一切都覺得易於看見。但埃第突然想到一個念頭－惠爾許查過的地方决不會再查的。他於是揭開了咖啡壺蓋，把長串的珠子放進去。不久，當惠爾許重復走進這屋子，他第一樣看見的東西便是這咖啡壺而立即想倒咖啡喝。急汗潛出了勞雷的額，埃第抖着仲手想去奪。但咖啡已流到杯中，患爾許啜飲之下認爲與洗碗水無異，於是他亦不喝了。一回惠爾許又到寢室裏去繼續搜尋了。蕭麗趁勢溜進餐室，從咖啡壺中取出那珠子，躱到埃第的背後，拉著他的衣服道：（不要騙我，爸爸－我又找到了！）埃第幾乎嚇痴。他從她手裏攫取了珠子，丢給她一個小銀元，要她自已去買冰淇濂吃。蕭麗快樂地走了。惠爾許正專心在臥室裏搜查。埃第知道須立刻藏去－勞雷瞧見一具地毯刷，就連忙把它打開，把珠子塞了進去。突然間又有一種粗俗的聲氣嚇了他們一跳，原是安𡞏－公寓裏的傭婦－要借地毯刷！勞雷與埃第眼見着地毯刷去了滿身輕鬆了好些。惠爾許疑心地望着，摇着他的頭。决不會在這裏面的！他惡狠狠地注視着這兩個青年。（好，今天饒你－保不要以爲我從此罷手了！）</p>
<p>當惠爾許走後，他們飛奔去追回地毯刷。但當他們將地毯刷打開看時，裏面祗有些塵埃。珠子那裏去了？這時安𡞏也少在去向了，今夜是她的假期。埃第，勞雷，凱與琪恩各地方都找遍，珠子却没有找到。</p>
<p>埃第一個人在家裏尋找，忽然聽見低微的（舉手），他站起來。原來是史東來取珠子的。史東執了手槍逼着埃第，使埃第退無可退，背靠了墻壁。史東這時已到了屋子的中心。埃第用手臂把墻上的管貯藏在墻内的床舖的機扭一按，床立即倒下來，正打着史東。埃第迅速的把他一拳打昏。他把史東用繩索綑紥之後，就將他拖到廚房裏，飛奔去找警察…</p>
<p>蕭麗因爲尋一隻貓，無意中從垃圾欄裏又尋到了珠子。她驚畜地飛奔回去，呌着：（爸爸－爸爸－我找到了！）可是爸爸已不知去向。而那送她珠子的人却臥在廚房裏，周身被繩子綑着。蕭麗懷疑地瞧着他。（噲，先生，你的珠子不見了，但已給我找到！）史東仰視着道：（好極。你眞是個聰明的好孩子。但是請你替我繩子解開吧。）蕭麗對他細細的看了一會。（你是玩著游戲嗎？）史東騙她道：（你的爸爸把我綁子起來讓我不能偷看的？）蕭麗依然有些遲疑。但她經不起史東的一再騙她。她於是拿了一把廚刀，替他割斷了繩子。</p>
<p>眞幸運，埃第没有走遠。警察已得到警報知道史東在附近出現，佛雷尼根率領警察們包圍了這屋子。凱比他們先到數秒鐘。她一到家就聽到那狂喊：（救命！爸爸！放我吧！放我吧！）這是蕭麗的聲言。她不顧死活的飛奔上樓。但是等到她上樓，史東已經挾了蕭麗從窗口上屋頂去了。凱的驚呼蓋住了孩子的喊呌。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Regarding Various Locations' Anti-Smuggling Efforts <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Customs Announces Tax Collection Methods for Each Post; Gubeikou Branch Post Scheduled to Open on the 22nd; Tao Shangming and Yin Rugeng Discuss Bandit Suppression Issues</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Jimi District Public Office, in order to assist the tax posts in anti-smuggling efforts, has appointed eleven special agents and one chief inspector. This appointment has been approved by the Hebei Provincial Government. This morning, the special agents for Gubeikou, Zhaojiakou, Baimaguan (Lin Zhongda), and Huangfengguan (Liang Shao), totaling eleven, gathered at Yin Rugeng's residence. They then departed in long-distance buses, scheduled to arrive in Miyun that evening. Tomorrow morning, personnel from each post will depart for their respective locations. Each person will be accompanied by three inspectors and eight anti-smuggling police, all selected from the Jimi District Security Team. Upon arrival at their posts, they will immediately begin anti-smuggling duties. The Luanyu District has also decided to dispatch several special agents to assist in the work. The Nantianmen pseudo-police sub-station will be converted into an anti-smuggling special agent's office to facilitate the inspection of merchants engaged in smuggling. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Gubeikou branch post will be officially established and begin operations on the 22nd. The Tianjin Customs has announced the methods for collecting taxes at each branch post along the Great Wall. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng discussed various issues in the war zone: 1. Many roads and bridges in various counties have been washed away. It is planned to repair them separately. In addition to requesting funds from the central government, it is planned to divert 200,000 from the remaining funds of the war zone work relief group. 2. The principle of taking over Malanyu has long been decided. If transportation cannot be restored in the short term, special measures will be sought to carry out the takeover. 3. Among the Japanese and Korean vagrants in the war zone, the largest number are in Ji County and Zunhua, followed by Yutian. Pinggu, Miyun, Gubeikou, Shunyi and other counties have the fewest. Efforts to crack down on them have already begun. The heads of the Ji County and Zunhua Public Security Bureaus have been replaced due to their ineffective crackdowns. Cracking down on vagrants is a preliminary measure to combat drugs. Further plans will be made to thoroughly eliminate drugs. 4. Regarding the establishment of posts at various passes of the Great Wall, there is only one in the Jimi District, Gubeikou. The post chief, Peng Danian, arrived in Gu at noon on the 17th and will be able to establish the post in one or two days. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming visited Yin Rugeng this morning to discuss the issue of jointly suppressing banditry in the Luanyu District with the Jimi District. Tao visited Zhang Yongnian last night to discuss the establishment of customs branch posts in the Luanyu District. It is reported that the Yiyuan Pass branch post will be established first. Zhang Yongnian will go to the area for inspection within a few days. After the inspection, preparations will begin. At that time, part of the security team there will be reassigned as anti-smuggling tax police. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the recent talks between Chinese and Japanese representatives in Dalian, the situation in North China has indeed become slightly better. Most of the issues concerning the reorganization of the war zone are being carried out step by step. Soon, after Huang returns north to take office, all issues can be resolved. It is rumored that the Japanese side has new demands on North China, which is completely groundless. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Gubeikou branch post, under the jurisdiction of Tianjin Customs, has been prepared and is ready to operate. Post Chief Peng Danian began preparations after arriving at Gubeikou on the 15th. It is scheduled to be officially established on the 22nd and start collecting taxes. For foreign goods imported through various passes of the Great Wall, taxes will be levied according to the current import tariff rates, plus a 5% customs surtax and a 5% disaster relief surtax. As for imported local goods, they will be levied or exempted separately according to the current methods of various customs for products from the eastern provinces. Tianjin Customs issued a notice on the 17th and published the interim methods for collecting taxes. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming talked about the establishment of branch posts at various passes of the Great Wall. Peng Danian, chief of the Gubeikou post in the Jimi District, has gone to start collecting taxes. Zhang Yongnian has inspected the four passes in the Luanyu District that have been decided to set up posts: Xifeng, Jieling, Lengkou, and Yiyuan. It is now planned to send personnel to each pass within a few days to formally establish branch posts. I am also preparing to send personnel to assist with everything. Yin Rugeng said that the Tianjin Customs has decided to set up the third sub-bureau of the Gubeikou Xiapo Public Security Bureau for the Gubeikou branch office. The date for taking over the Eastern Tombs has not been set due to traffic obstruction. Illegal activities of Koreans in the war zone have been strictly ordered to be investigated by various counties. Ji County has arrested illegal Korean vagrants and handed them over to the Japanese embassy and local Japanese military police for punishment. Regarding the plan to reorganize transportation in the war zone, counties have been ordered to report the width and condition of various river bridges in detail to estimate the overall amount of funds required. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A certain security team in Tangshan colluded with a certain foreigner to hire sailboats from various seaports in the Northeast to transport certain foreign goods to the entrance of the Luan River. Then, the team protects them, collecting 70% less per item than the customs duty, and then distributes them to various places. More of these smuggled goods are imported into the Shaliuhe Town of Fengrun County. The Tianjin Customs has sent personnel to investigate and requested assistance from the Public Security Bureau. (17th Dispatch) (Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong talked about the bandits in eastern Luan. According to Zhou Yuying, the former commander of the Third Security Brigade of the War Zone, the bandits in Luan County and Funing have also been eliminated. There are only small groups of bandits causing disturbances in other places, and attention has been paid to preventing and suppressing them, so they will not cause any major problems. However, the areas of Yuguan and Qinhuangdao have special circumstances, and it is more difficult to suppress them, but there are no large groups either. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Troops Continue Exercises in Qinyu Area <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Night Combat Exercise Held in Nandaisi the Night Before; Bandits Appear Outside West Gate of Yucheng</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, Japanese troops in Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan are still conducting exercises. The Japanese troops in Nandaisi conducted a night combat exercise on the afternoon of the 16th. The defending troops held the trenches and stubbornly resisted the imaginary enemy. The attacking troops used tracer bullets to bombard the trenches, and then used armored vehicles to cover the main force to attack. The exercise lasted all night and ended at 5:00 AM. This morning, they rested. At 2:00 PM, gunfire broke out again and the exercise began. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong said that the large-scale exercise by the Japanese troops in Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan is a common occurrence, but this year it has been expanded. In addition to the North China Garrison Army, a large number of Kwantung Army personnel have been added, and the momentum is also great. It is still in progress. The provincial government has not received any official report on this. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) During the Great Wall War last year, the Yuguan "First Pass Under Heaven" city tower and hexagonal pavilion were destroyed by Japanese artillery fire. Recently, the Japanese side has been repairing them under the pretext of preserving historical sites. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Yuguan said that the Japanese troops in Yuguan have been busy with troop rotations for several days and have stopped exercising for several days. However, the Japanese troops outside the Great Wall are actively setting up defenses and burying iron蒺藜nets near the Great Wall. The area from Yuguan Station to the South Gate is very safe. Bandits have been found outside the West Gate from time to time, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Gunfire has been continuous from night until dawn.

He has already used the Japanese ship Nitto Maru for trial voyages and intends to encroach on maritime hegemony in the Bohai Sea. Currently, the Japanese side has three 700-ton merchant ships cruising the Bohai Sea, using Huludao as a base. There are a total of six methods for developing Huludao: (1) Establishing a branch office of the Shanhaiguan Customs in Huludao; (2) Operating a train between Jinzhou and Huludao once a day; (3) Jointly operating sampans and regular routes; (4) The sampan group must be approved by the Jinzhou Consulate; (5) The warehouse is temporarily borrowed from the Fengshan Railway's freight yard for application; (6) The pier is built by the Zizhi Port Association.

<h3 id="e26">Development of Proper Paths for Secondary Normal and Vocational Education <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, we presented a commentary. We discussed the current secondary education system, suggesting that vocational schools at all levels could be established independently. However, regular secondary schools should also possess vocational characteristics and not be viewed as purely preparatory institutions for higher education. Today, we want to further explore the issue of developing secondary normal and vocational education and assess the value of the Ministry of Education's newly established standards for allocating secondary education funding.</p>
<p>A certain official from the Ministry of Education once made a responsible statement on this issue. The general idea was that ordinary secondary schools in our country are unusually developed, while vocational and normal education have made little progress, especially vocational education. Therefore, the Ministry of Education's new policy is to limit funding for ordinary secondary schools to expand vocational and normal education. In recent years, due to the imbalanced development of secondary education in our country, primary schools lack qualified teachers, and ordinary secondary school graduates who cannot go on to higher education cannot engage in vocational work. All of these are ironclad facts. Without this official's remarks, we would have held the same deep feelings. However, we believe that this matter is significant. To seek remedies, we must first understand the root causes of past failures in secondary education and consider the social environment in various regions to make comprehensive plans. Then, the entire nation, from top to bottom, should work together to implement these plans according to the established procedures. If we rely solely on the efforts of the highest educational administrative agency and use funding allocation standards as the primary tool, we fear that even if the authorities are extremely diligent, it will still be ineffective. We deeply feel that to develop secondary education, we must first seek a solid foundation in elementary education. The goal of secondary normal education is to provide qualified teachers for primary schools, which is common in countries around the world. As for vocational education in our country, it should first dedicate its full efforts to primary schools, which may not be universally known. The reason why secondary normal schools and vocational schools are not as developed as ordinary secondary schools is that graduates of normal and vocational schools generally feel that there is no way out, just like ordinary secondary school graduates who cannot go on to higher education. Because the knowledge and skills learned by normal and vocational school graduates are more specialized than those of secondary school graduates, their opportunities are even fewer. Secondary normal school graduates can only become primary school teachers. Secondary vocational school graduates can only become modern foremen. Although the nature of the two is different, the one thing they share is that they are not valued by society. However, secondary school graduates can become university students, which everyone envies. Once they graduate from university, although there is still the worry of unemployment, this is a matter of several years later. In these few years, they can live freely. Therefore, most young people prefer to be ordinary secondary school students who are candidates for university students rather than normal or vocational school students who are candidates for primary school teachers or modern foremen. If the government truly wants to avoid the drawbacks of the imbalanced development of secondary education, it should first determine the direction of normal and vocational education. There is no other way but to work on elementary education so that normal school students have proper and satisfactory opportunities, and useful young people do not waste their time and money in secondary vocational schools, only to find that they cannot use what they have learned.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the issue of teachers in primary schools. Primary school teachers in our country have always been known for their hardship. In the past, during the imperial examination era, only old scholars who repeatedly failed the examinations were willing to sit on cold benches in three-family villages, barely making a living as schoolteachers for the rest of their years. Even today, the treatment of primary school teachers is still extremely meager. For example, the importance of rural normal schools has been recognized by all knowledgeable people, but the average monthly salary of primary school teachers in rural Jiangsu is less than twenty-five yuan, less than fourteen yuan in Anhui, eleven yuan on average in Hebei, and only four yuan at the lowest. The average is only eight yuan in Jiangxi. However, there are unexpected situations. Jiangsu is one of the most developed provinces in our country in terms of primary school education, but nearly half of the graduates from provincial and county normal schools in the 21st and 22nd years cannot find positions. The director of the Provincial Department of Education, seeing that there is an oversupply of primary school teachers in the province, said, "I am deeply convinced that in the field of secondary education in Jiangsu Province, not only can ordinary secondary schools not expand arbitrarily, but also normal schools should find ways to tighten up." Although the situation in other provinces may not be as bad as in Jiangsu, it is still an undeniable fact that many normal school graduates are idle and unemployed or seek other livelihoods every year. Currently, the treatment of primary school teachers is so meager, and the opportunities for normal school students are so difficult. Even if we can increase the funding for normal schools from 10% to 25% in the total budget for secondary education, what is enough to encourage students to devote themselves to normal education or arouse the enthusiasm of parents to send their children to normal schools, except for some improvement in school facilities and teaching? If there are qualified primary school teachers but no primary schools to place them, or if there are positions for primary school teachers but the income is not enough to support their parents and raise their wives and children, who would readily change their attitude of disregarding normal education just because normal schools have been slightly improved? Furthermore, even if we take a step back and assume that normal education will greatly develop due to increased funding, it will only create more educated unemployed individuals.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about secondary vocational education. Vocational education in our country began at the end of the Qing Dynasty, but its achievements were not significant. The reasons for its failure are: first, the underdeveloped state of production industries in our country. Except for a few industrial areas, there is a lack of a foundation for the development of vocational schools. Second, organizers do not pay attention to local socio-economic conditions, production organizations, and raw material supply, so the school curriculum cannot adapt to the times and places. Third, people in the industry and economy do not know how to cooperate closely with organizers, support the progress of vocational schools, and promote their success. Today, the number of vocational school graduates is not very large, but there is already a lament that it is not easy to find employment. According to the Jiangsu education statistics for the 22nd year, approximately 44% of graduates from senior high school vocational programs in the province cannot find jobs. Li Ximou, a specialist from the Ministry of Education, reported that graduates from vocational schools in Bengbu and Wuhu in Anhui, and the First Vocational School in Jiangxi also feel the pain of having no way out. In all fairness, is this the students' fault? Mr. Morehead, Deputy Director of the International Labor Bureau, once told officials of our country's Ministry of Education that China should run practical vocational schools and not put on a false front. His words are thought-provoking. We believe that the most practical vocational schools today are not secondary or higher vocational schools, but elementary vocational schools aimed at improving handicrafts. If we do not understand whether all provinces and cities in the country have a common need for secondary vocational schools and their environment, and rashly issue orders to increase them in large numbers, the result will be no different from expanding secondary normal schools and neglecting the opportunities for their graduates.</p>
<p>Therefore, we want to suggest the following to the government: (1) In the area of secondary normal education, efforts should first be made to develop primary education in order to increase the need for primary school teachers and the opportunities for normal school students. At the same time, it is necessary to (A) screen primary school teachers in various regions and dismiss those who are not very competent, provide them with appropriate training, and have normal school graduates take their place. However, during the training period for dismissed teachers, living expenses should still be provided as usual, and training expenses should also be borne by the public. (B) Increase the salaries of primary school teachers, adopt efficiency-based salary increases and a pension system to reward their hard work. (C) Establish holiday schools and short-term refresher courses to improve the abilities and knowledge of in-service teachers and cultivate their interest in their careers.</p>
<p>(2) In the area of vocational education, the actual needs and environment of the vocational school location should be considered separately. Except for a few modern industrial areas, the expansion of secondary or higher vocational schools can be slowed down, and full efforts should be devoted to the addition of elementary vocational schools. As for secondary vocational schools in industrial areas: (A) attention should be paid to local economic conditions and social needs, and then special courses and internships should be determined. Efforts should be made to improve existing industries. (B) The government should encourage private industrial enterprises such as agriculture, industry, and commerce to accommodate vocational school students for internships to learn from them. Needless to say, official industrial enterprises and factories should be open. (C) Local vocational schools should form school committees with local industry representatives, principals, and teachers to seek cooperation between the school and society. (D) Following the French vocational education inspection system, inspectors should be set up in each important area. In addition to inspecting academic affairs, their duties include communicating and liaising between the school and the industry, as well as consulting and deliberating on business matters with the central Ministry of Education's inspectors.</p>
<p>In short, to correct the drawbacks of the imbalanced development of secondary education, we should seek solutions based on the actual situation of developing primary education and the difficulty for secondary school graduates to find employment. If we do not do this and only seek to reform the standards for secondary school funding, we fear that the impact will not only fail to increase the possibility of employment for normal and vocational school students but may also deepen the existing panic due to the expansion of enrollment in such schools.</p>

<p>The Army Ministry Adopts a Threatening Attitude</p>
<p>Soviet Deputy Station Master Detained and on Hunger Strike</p>
<p>Russian Residents in the China Eastern Railway Area Return Home</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a statement made today by a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese government is currently considering issuing a general warning to Soviet Russia, but no decision has yet been made. This warning will mention border incidents and provocative acts by Soviet Russia but will not contain any use of force. Soviet Russia is now propagating that Japan intends to occupy the China Eastern Railway, but it dares to guarantee that Japan has no such intention. The Soviet claim that Japan wants to occupy the railway because the authorities of (Manchukuo) arrested Soviet employees of the China Eastern Railway is completely unfounded. The arrest of employees of the China Eastern Railway is purely an affair of independent (Manchukuo) and has nothing to do with the transfer negotiations of the China Eastern Railway. The Japanese government now believes that these negotiations are still in progress and have not broken down. The spokesman also said that a total of seventeen employees of the China Eastern Railway have been arrested. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army Ministry issued a public statement today, listing thirteen incidents that occurred in the eastern section of the China Eastern Railway from April to July to prove the justification for the arrest of seventeen employees of the China Eastern Railway. The statement said that an investigation has revealed that the accidents involving Japanese military trains and trains transporting military supplies were caused by the Soviet Far Eastern Army issuing orders to the Soviet employees and organizations of the China Eastern Railway, who then ordered (bandits) to attack. It also stated that the (Man) government will continue to work harder to eliminate anti-(Man) elements in the China Eastern Railway. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese Army authorities are taking a positive attitude toward the numerous unpleasant incidents caused by the Soviet Union in the (Manchukuo) territory in order to fully resolve various important outstanding issues between the two countries. However, the recent intensified propaganda by the Russian side to defame Japan to various countries is likely to cause misunderstandings among the countries. Therefore, the Army authorities have decided to abandon their passive attitude and deal with Soviet Russia. The Army Ministry also advocates that Japan should disengage from all relations with the Russian-Manchukuo China Eastern Railway negotiations. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>News from Boli and Harbin: Mr. Xu Luom, the Soviet deputy station master of Harbin, was arrested without cause a month ago and is now using hunger strikes to protest this action and demand a prompt investigation of this case. Mr. Xu became extremely weak and seriously ill after six days of hunger strike, so he was moved from prison to a hospital for treatment. However, his physical condition is worrying.

<p>(Harbin) According to reports, more than 1,500 Soviet Russian residents from Yimianpo, Muling, Wuzhan, Qiqihar, Boketu, and Manchuli have recently returned to their country. The Russian residents in the eastern and western sections of the China Eastern Railway are now only the employees of the railway. (5th Reuters Correspondence)</p>

<p>Provocation by the Japanese Military Delegation</p>
<p>Boli received a message from here that a moving and sensational message has appeared in the Harbin newspapers, namely accusations of provocations against the Soviet Consulate in Suifenhe Station. The message falsely accuses the consulate and Consul Stedmatch personally of organizing armed personnel to attack the Japanese military delegation in Suifenhe Station and assassinating a White Russian guard of the delegation during this attack in March of this year. The message indicated that the attacks by these provocateurs were initially not limited to the China Eastern Railway and planned to make more serious provocations against the Soviet Consulate in Suifenhe Station. According to Harbin residents familiar with current affairs, there is now solid evidence to prove that the above-mentioned provocative message was instigated by the Japanese military delegation in Harbin. (17th Tass Dispatch)</p>
<p>Boli received a message from Harbin that the Police Department has issued a new order restricting the transaction of (Puche). So-called Puche are vehicles attached to trains that are equipped like shops, and their function on the road has existed for many years. This new method by the Manchurian authorities is also nothing more than an attempt to prevent the China Eastern Railway from carrying out routine work. If there are no Puche, the road workers and Soviet Russian people scattered near the small stations on the road have no way to live because there are no other facilities to provide living materials in the area. Therefore, they are now in a very difficult situation. (16th Tass Dispatch)</p>

<p>Listing Past Border Incidents</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army has released the following recent examples of Soviet behavior in (Manchukuo) territory: (1) On May 24 and June 4, patrols from Boli reconnoitered the Heilongjiang River and crossed the border line by one mile, constituting a border crossing patrol. (2) On May 12, the Manchukuo ship Jixian was illegally fired upon while sailing in Heihe, killing one Manchu and seriously injuring one. (3) On May 18, the Manchukuo cargo ship Yanghu was illegally fired upon while sailing near the confluence of the Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers. (4) On May 28, the Manchukuo ship Wujin was fired upon by machine guns downstream of Ai Hui. (5) The Soviet Union side has set up guard facilities at the delta confluence of the Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers in Manchukuo territory, prohibiting Manchus and Koreans from entering. (6) On February 14, 15, and 16, Soviet aircraft appeared over the area of Halaonor, reconnoitering the situation. (7) The Secret Police Department sent numerous secret agents to Manchukuo to collect information on the military situation of Japan and Manchukuo, the actions of anti-Manchu elements, and other intelligence. Recently, they have been arrested by the police in Manchuli. (8) Two Manchu hunters were arrested by the secret police while hunting near Manchuli on May 18, and only one was released.

<p>Herriot Praises the Soviet Union's Peaceful Policies</p>
<p>Herriot, the former French Prime Minister and current Mayor of Lyon, hosted a banquet to welcome the Soviet Russian aviators. In his welcome speech, Mr. Herriot said, "We are extremely impressed by the excellence of Soviet Russian aircraft and the confidence and precision of Soviet Russian pilots during their flights. Today, we have been able to understand the power of Soviet Russian aviation. However, the factor of this power is only a part of the greatness of the Soviet Russian people. What is more important and the source of Soviet Russian power is the sincere efforts of the Soviet Russian people to strive for peace. I remember Litvinov's words that peace is the supreme well-being of the people. I firmly believe that only this kind of regime, with the masses as its background and expressing the hopes of the masses, can sincerely strive for peace, and only this kind of regime can defend its people and prevent them from being destroyed and invaded. I wish that France and the Soviet Union can have closer and more friendly relations."</p>
<p>Rosenberg, the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in France, then rose to deliver a reply, saying, "The understanding between France and the Soviet Union has a large foundation. Both countries are dedicated to peace. At the same time, their close cooperation in various aspects is a strong guarantee of peace in Europe itself. The strong welcome from all levels of France and the press to the Soviet Russian aviators proves the true meaning of this trip by the Soviet Russian aviators. Mr. Herriot believes that only a government like the Soviet Russian government, which is produced by a powerful mass movement, can implement a policy that expresses its sincere and profound efforts to strive for peace. I share these feelings. At the same time, adventure groups that isolate the masses can only engage in criminal activities, trying to sacrifice the safety and peace of the people of various European countries to resolve their internal contradictions." Afterwards, the leader of the Soviet Russian flight group, Ensign Ensilito, rose and said, "The Soviet Russian people have struggled hard to obtain their right to devote themselves to peaceful labor. Therefore, they will go all out to consolidate peace. This can be proven by our trip. The French people are very willing to have peace. We already know this deeply. Last year, French aviators led by the Minister of Aviation made a special trip to our country to prove this point." When the Soviet Russian flight group left the banquet hall, the crowd shouted "Long live Soviet Russian aviation" to welcome them. (16th Tass Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Theory of a Franco-Russian Military Alliance</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the news that France and Russia signed a military alliance in August, the Japanese government believes that it is a misrepresentation of the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty and believes that this matter is an unsettling event in the international community. The political alliances that exist now between European countries are the isolation policy of France and Russia against Germany and the policy of the Soviet Russia to ensure its territory in the Far East, the Eastern European Locarno Pact, and the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty. If such a Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty is formally established, the Soviet Union will have no need to be vigilant on its western border, and there is no doubt that it will take a tough attitude towards Japan and Manchukuo in the East in the future. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Army are paying close attention to the attitude of the Soviet Union. (17th Japan Alliance Dispatch)</p>

<p>Alliance with Russia is Not a Fact</p>
<p>(Paris) A certain American news agency released a message abroad stating that if Germany and Poland refuse to join the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact before the end of the month, France will sign a defensive military treaty with Soviet Russia. This kind of message is not in accordance with the facts. Germany and Poland have not yet responded to the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. No predictions can be made before the two countries have formally expressed their opinions. According to responsible parties, after the recent unavoidable war of words in the newspapers, it seems that Germany and Poland have a better understanding of the benefits of joining the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. This can be seen from various signs. Paris and Moscow have resolved to sign a Russian-French alliance treaty on the eve of Soviet Russia's joining the League of Nations. The fact that France is loyal to the League of Nations and abides by the spirit on which the League is based is known to everyone, and the alliance policy has long been rejected by international public opinion. In this situation, even if Germany and Poland refuse to join the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact as the American news agency predicts, we cannot imagine that Russia and France will conclude an alliance.

<p>(Moscow) The Finnish press is currently launching a campaign hoping for the outbreak of war between the Soviet Union and Japan in order to complete its invasion from within. The Truth Daily commented on this in an article, "It is said that Finnish nationalists intend to annex Karelia and Ingria, and they want to move the (Greater Finland) border to the Urals. This news only makes readers in the Soviet Union and other countries who have not yet lost their sense of humor smile. Large-scale organizational work is currently underway within Finland to realize Finland's aggressive (national mission) at the appropriate time. (The enemy is in the East) This is the official (but sometimes concealed due to diplomatic requirements) and sometimes public slogan of Finnish policy. (For several years, the Soviet Union has been appealing to the Finnish authorities to establish a sincere neighborly and peaceful relationship. Even today, this is still the case. However, they have not accepted the hand of the Soviet Union. On the contrary, they are trying to hold the hand extended from the (remote islands) hanging high over the heads of 17,000 people in the Soviet Union. This is indeed a fact.

<h3 id="e36">Soviet Union and the Ethnic Minorities of the Far North <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(TASS, Moscow, July 16th) The Soviet Union has a large number of scattered ethnic minorities in the North. Their villages are scattered across an area of 15,000 kilometers, from Lapland in the west to the Bering Strait in the east, and south to the Manchurian border. There are 25 ethnic groups, totaling about 150,000 people. Some groups have fewer than a thousand adult males. These people are known as the Lopar, Nenets, Ostyak, Tungus, Chukchi, Koryak, Kamchadal, and Gilyak, among others. They are considered experts in reindeer husbandry and sled dog training and their fishing and hunting skills are comparable to those of civilized people. Their fishing rights have long been exploited by European and American whalers. They were once conquered by the Russian Cossacks, and Moscow merchants exchanged cheap calico, tobacco, and inferior wine for their valuable sable and other furs. Imperial Russian officials imposed exorbitant taxes, and the natives inevitably suffered from cold and hunger. The eternal glory of the Soviet regime in this region lies in guiding them onto the path of civilization. During the Imperial Russian era, there were only a few church schools in the area. Now there are 286 schools, with students accounting for 55% of school-age children. In 1933, the school budget was 2.6 million rubles. There are now 53 clubs, 186 reading rooms, and 87 mobile cinemas. There are also so-called cultural base camps, which are complete towns with schools providing meals, permanent hospitals, factories, veterinary stations, museums, experimental breeding grounds, and complete district Soviets. There are 12 such cultural base camps, and six more are currently being built. Sixteen languages now have alphabets, and the literacy rate has increased tenfold. Newspapers are published in local languages. Previously, the sick were always treated by witch doctors, but now there are many hospitals. The area is divided into several ethnic regions, including nine ethnic provinces and seventy-seven ethnic districts. There are 462 Soviets that have been established, and their work is closely related to the Northern Committee in Moscow. National universities have been established in Khabarovsk, Yeniseysk, and Naryan-Mar, and the famous Institute of the Peoples of the North is located in Leningrad. The Northern ethnic groups are extremely grateful for the efforts of the Soviet government. They strongly support the Frangodan Soviet settlement and actively assisted in the rescue of the Chelyuskin crew. In short, the progress of these ethnic groups in the last twenty years has exceeded twenty centuries, as they have jumped from the primitive communist society of the early Stone Age into a socialist society.</p>

<p>Papen Dispels It</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to the German News Agency, when Deputy Chancellor Papen was asked about his opinion on the August 19th plebiscite, Papen replied, "During this period of national mourning, when the entire country is mourning the late President, those who hate our country are constantly speculating about Hindenburg's will, claiming that the National Socialist Party once declared that it would never be released, but now it has suddenly been revealed. I personally delivered this will to Hitler in order to dispel the doubts of the world. The best way to do this is for Hitler to immediately make this eternally memorable document public, without hesitation, which is the most reliable evidence of his loyalty and continuing the legacy of the late President. The main point of the will is that the late President wished to see the internal unity of the entire German nation consolidated. This unity was Hindenburg's unwavering goal until his last breath, and Hitler has already put it into practice on January 30, 1933. Germany's ability to fulfill its historical mission depends on this. Hitler's only wish is to fulfill the last wish of the late President. If we want to achieve this, there is no other way than to unite and follow Hitler, remaining steadfast in this goal."</p>
<p>(Havas, July 16th) (Paris) Since the publication of the political will of the late German President Hindenburg, French newspapers have published detailed accounts of the important parts. The newspapers believe that the publication of this important document has a major impact on the upcoming plebiscite and is particularly beneficial to Chancellor Hitler's succession to the presidency. However, at the same time, many newspapers doubt whether the document was actually written by Hindenburg. For example, the Echo de Paris believes that the first part of the will is dated 1919, so there is no doubt about its authenticity. However, as a whole, the document is actually a supreme piece of propaganda under Hitler's rule. The Paris Daily expresses doubt about the origin of the second section of the document, but its conclusion is that the former president did acknowledge the value of Hitler's work. The Petit Journal states that it is impossible to determine the authenticity of the document at this time, but the document can indicate Hindenburg's political achievements and what history will see in the future. In addition, the Paysan de Paris does not doubt the authenticity of the document, and states that the document is actually a testament to Hindenburg's loyalty to the old Prussian spirit.</p>
<p>(Agence Nationale, July 16th) (London) Since the publication of the political will of the late German President Hindenburg, London newspapers have commented on it. The Times today published a Berlin dispatch stating that the publication of the will, only three days before Sunday's plebiscite, shows that its purpose is to encourage national voting, so that those who have not yet decided whether to support Hitler will also vote in favor of Hitler's position as head of state. The Daily Telegraph states that the timing of the document's publication is a propaganda masterpiece. The Daily Express, in a mocking tone, states that the long-lost document has now suddenly been found. The Daily Herald expresses doubt about the reliability of the document's origin.</p>

In fact, the historical similarities between Germany and Austria are not as great as Papen stated. President Miklas only mentioned that Germany and Austria have the same language and the same culture. In addition, one point is particularly noteworthy: when President Miklas mentioned Germany and Austria, he used the phrase "two countries." As we expected, this phrase was used no less than three times in the speech, while Papen only referred to Germany and Austria as "two places," sometimes as countries, sometimes as places. The two contrast with each other, which is quite interesting.</p>

When the United States entered the European War, Gruening was summoned to Washington to assist in organizing the wartime Commerce Committee. After the task was completed, he returned to be the editor of the New York Tribune. However, as the war on the front lines was in full swing, he resigned from the position of editor in 1918 and joined the field artillery. After the peace was concluded, he returned to journalism.

<p>Dispatching Personnel to Investigate the Products of the Xilin Gol and Ulanqab Leagues in Inner Mongolia; Planting 300,000 Mu of Opium in Kailu, Northern Rehe</p>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) After Japan annexed the four northeastern provinces, it revised Tanaka's Manchurian-Mongolian policy and planned to complete its control over Manchuria and Mongolia first before carrying out other conspiracies. A certain Mongolian notable residing in Beiping received a telegram from Bailingmiao today (16th) stating that recently, large numbers of Japanese have been discovered traveling from Rehe to the Xilin Gol League and the Ulanqab League under the guise of tourism, investigating the systems, tax revenues, and general living conditions of each league and banner. Their intentions are unclear. The Japanese each carry maps, binoculars, cameras, and notebooks, and three of them are carrying surveying equipment. Because the Xilin Gol League is located in western Rehe and is an important league and banner in northern Chahar, its youth have a relatively high level of education, and its princes also have considerable influence. Furthermore, because the Ulanqab League is located in northern Suiyuan and includes four departments and six banners, it is an important area in Inner Mongolia. In addition, since the Xilin Gol and Ulanqab Leagues border Outer Mongolia, they can be used to prevent Russia and control the westward retreat of the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. Therefore, they are actively investigating Inner Mongolia, starting with the Xilin Gol and Ulanqab Leagues. Although Inner Mongolia is a desert region, its products are very rich. The Mongolians rely solely on animal husbandry for a living, and cattle, horses, sheep, and camels are abundant. Agricultural products include sorghum, wheat, pine, fir, apricot, and plum. Among the minerals, coal and iron are especially abundant. The Japanese have long coveted this, so they are actively carrying out aggression.</p>
<p>In addition, the Japanese previously planned to control the production and sale of opium in Rehe. They established an Opium Monopoly Bureau in Chengde, specializing in the public sale of opium, which was contracted by the Japanese East Asia Development Company. According to a person from Gubeikou, an opium monopoly bureau organized by the Japanese has recently been discovered outside Gubeikou. According to someone working at the bureau, the East Asia Development Company recently enclosed 300,000 mu of private land in Kailu, Rehe, specifically to grow opium. This year's production is already enormous. (16th)</p>

<p>(Shenyang Correspondence) The Japanese army in the Northeast fears two major enemies the most: the Volunteer Army and Soviet Russia. Therefore, they are actively building transportation networks to facilitate military transport in order to deal with everything. In addition to expanding railway lines, they are also using the name of the pseudo-railway bureau to build automobile roads throughout the Northeast and have the pseudo-officials responsible for managing them.

<p>Estimated Reserves of Approximately 80 Million Tons.</p>
<p>(Singapore Special Dispatch) Among the specialties of the Malay Peninsula, plants are most famous for rubber, and minerals are most famous for tin (i.e., pewter). However, in addition to tin, there is also iron among the minerals, and the output in recent years has also been quite significant. Unfortunately, all of them are controlled by the Japanese, unlike tin mines, where the majority are operated by overseas Chinese. The discovery of iron mines was originally initiated by the Japanese. Several years ago, a rubber plantation company operated by the Japanese in Malaya leased 2,000 acres of land in Johor (a state) for planting rubber trees. Within this rubber plantation, a high-quality limonite ore containing 55% to 66% iron was suddenly discovered. The total area of this mine is about 800 acres, and several other sites have been discovered later. Japan lacks iron mines domestically, so they were naturally overjoyed to find this unexpected treasure. Japanese mining experts came one after another to survey, test, and excavate with all their efforts. According to a report by the Japanese Colonial Ministry, the reserves of iron mines in the Malay Peninsula are extremely abundant. It has now been determined that there are about 80 million tons. Japanese entrepreneurs have organized three major companies to operate them: the Ishihara Sangyo Company, the Nippon Mining Company, and the Itagaki Trading Company. The iron mine operated by the Ishihara Company covers an area of approximately 1,045 acres, and the total ore volume is approximately 12 million tons. It is hematite ore with an iron content of over 60%. The current annual output is 8,000 to 10,000 tons. The Nippon Mining Company's operating site is in the Tugong area of Terengganu. The mining area covers approximately 1,080 acres, and the ore volume is approximately 60 million tons. The ore is mainly magnetite, containing approximately 30% to 40% hematite, with an iron content of over 60%. The current annual output is 300,000 to 400,000 tons, and it is expected to increase to 600,000 to 700,000 tons next year. The Itagaki Company's operating site is at the Baitun station in Kedah. It is hematite ore with an iron content of 60%, and the ore volume is approximately 5 million tons. Most of the ore produced by the three companies is sold to the Nippon Steel Corporation, with a price of 10 Straits dollars per ton, which can generate a profit of about 2-3 yuan. The Nippon Steel Corporation then transports the ore back to Japan for smelting. Because the Malay Peninsula lacks coal, and Japan is closer to this area than European countries, the iron mines of the Malay Peninsula have no choice but to be completely controlled by the Japanese.</p>

Each company had five to seven deputy company commanders and was divided into three platoons. Since the opening of the school on the 2nd, Chairman Chiang has been working at the corps headquarters and has personally given speeches, admonishing the military officers to fulfill their national revival duties and the essentials of the New Life Movement. He is not only serious about the teaching of various subjects and field exercises but also attaches great importance to spiritual lectures. In addition to hiring specialized academic talents to give lectures and current officials to share their modern experiences and observations, Party and state officials have been invited to give speeches to the corps. Zhu Zhaoming, Kong Xiangxi, Chen Guofu, Zhang Xueliang, Chen Shaokuan, Wang Shijie, Cheng Tianfang, and Liu Zhi have all given speeches to the corps. Chairman Chiang has telegraphed to the trained military officers from the above provinces to assemble at Lushan by the end of this month, as the third term will begin soon. He has also instructed the commanding officers to report the number of trained officers immediately to prepare everything. As for those who cannot receive training due to the task of suppressing the communists, they will take turns visiting the corps for at least one week. The first batch of visitors included Wu Liang, Li Henghua, the chief of staff of the Third and Sixth Route Army Headquarters, and dozens of visitors from the 94th Division, including Li Fangchen, etc., and the rest will arrive one after another to gain insights.

<p>Present Situation in Qinghai</p>
<p>Qinghai is named after the Qinghai Lake (lit. Blue Sea), situated in the upper reaches of the rivers. It borders Gansu to the northeast, Xinjiang to the northwest, and Sichuan, Xikang, and Tibet to the south. The province has a total area of 2,562,500 square miles (according to the Qinghai Provincial Department of Civil Affairs) and a population of approximately 6.2 million. In ancient times, it was the land of the Western Qiang. Its rise and fall have been inconsistent throughout history, and its names have varied. During the Qing dynasty, the Xining Prefecture and various Mongol and Tibetan tribes were established, and in the early Republic of China, the Ninghai Garrison Commander was established, all under the jurisdiction of Gansu. After the establishment of the province in the 17th year of the Republic (1928), only the original seven counties under the jurisdiction of the former Xining Prefecture were included: Xining, Nianbo (now Ledu and Minhe counties), Datong, Yuanyuan, Guide, Xunhua, and Bayong (now Hualong County). Later, eight more counties were added: Gonghe, Qilian, Tongren, Minhe, Huzhu, Yushu, Dulan, and Nangqian (of which Gonghe, Yushu, Dulan, and Nangqian counties were newly converted from Tibetan areas through the "converting the chieftainships to administrative districts" policy, while the remaining four counties were split from the original seven counties). The northwestern part of the province has a particularly large area. The three counties of Yushu, Dulan, and Nangqian alone are in need of additional county governance in terms of politics, national defense, and economy. The current provincial authorities are planning for this. Yesterday, the reporter visited the provincial government and, because Chairman Ma Lin had returned to his hometown, was received by Secretary-General Feng Guorui, Provincial Committee members Tan Keming, Yao Jun, and others, who provided detailed information about the current situation in Qinghai.</p>
<p>Qinghai is located on the border, close to powerful neighbors, and with complex ethnic groups, making governance extremely difficult. Since the establishment of the province, only a few years have passed, and the province has devoted most of its efforts to securing the borders, defending against threats, and harmonizing various ethnic groups. Although financial difficulties are immense and various plans have not been realized, the province has nevertheless worked hard to overcome obstacles, build up military strength, invest in industries, improve transportation, develop education for all ethnic groups, foster harmony between Mongols and Tibetans, and promote various undertakings to the best of its ability. The province has either achieved remarkable results and established preliminary frameworks for the immediate tasks that should be undertaken, or has submitted plans and engaged in development. If the nation provides effective assistance and progresses without obstacles, then the future of Qinghai holds endless hope. The central government's determination to prosper the Northwest as a foundation for recovering lost territories has moved from the stage of propaganda to the stage of implementation. After Dai and Song went west, they discussed and planned with the provincial authorities on the important policies of animal husbandry, health, relief, and economy, which have been approved by the central government and are expected to be realized. The current situation of Qinghai's administration, economy, animal husbandry, water conservancy, education, and transportation is briefly described below.</p>
<p>Administration</p>
<p>Although the ethnic minorities in Qinghai are numerous and diverse, and their customs are unique, the consistent policy of the provincial authorities over the past two decades has been to adopt a lenient approach and deal with them calmly, which has achieved a harmonious and peaceful coexistence.</p>
<p>Economy</p>
<p>Although Qinghai Province has a vast territory, apart from the dozen or so counties in the Haidong area, most of the twenty counties are swampy, cold, and barren. All financial resources rely on the income from these dozen or so counties for maintenance, and the financial situation is extremely difficult. In terms of taxation, the province relies entirely on the production of wool, which is transported to Tianjin and other places for sale. In recent years, due to sluggish sales in the east, the fur and leather industry has stagnated, and the economy has been greatly affected. (The original price of wool was six or seven yuan per dan, plus provincial export taxes, transit taxes in Ningxia and Suiyuan, and transportation costs, the cost to the sales destination is about thirty yuan, and the selling price is sometimes less than this. Sometimes it is a bit higher but it cannot catch up, so wool sales are slow. Heavy taxes and inconvenient transportation are related.) Recently, at the National Financial Conference, representatives from Qinghai Province proposed the establishment of a Central Bank of China branch in Qinghai and requested assistance from the Qinghai provincial government, both of which were approved. If this happens, the difficulties will be slightly alleviated, and it will be easier to manage the government affairs.</p>
<p>Animal Husbandry</p>
<p>The northwestern and southern parts of Qinghai are pastures for Mongols and Tibetans, so cattle, sheep, and livestock breed and reproduce in abundance, making it one of the largest pastoral areas in Northwest China. However, because the local people adhere to old habits, they do not know how to improve the breed, and they do not pay attention to hygiene. When livestock are affected by disease, they are helpless and leave it to fate, so the quantity and quality are declining day by day. If active measures are not taken, the future is very worrying. The National Economic Commission has decided to allocate 200,000 yuan to handle animal husbandry in Qinghai Province, establish a hospital, and set up veterinary hygiene institutions in various counties to facilitate improvements. The future of animal husbandry is promising.</p>
<p>Water Conservancy</p>
<p>Qinghai is the source of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, with a very high altitude, averaging over 3,000 feet above sea level. The rivers flow down from a high position with great momentum. If there is rain, the water will flow down, and the provinces of Shandong, Henan, and other lower reaches will inevitably suffer from floods. Therefore, when talking about governing the Yellow River, extreme attention should be paid to the upper reaches of Qinghai. At the first meeting of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission last year (1933), Liu Rufan, the representative from Qinghai Province, proposed the establishment of a Gansu-Qinghai-Ningxia Water Conservancy Bureau to open canals, build embankments, plant forests, and measure and report water levels. This is a crucial plan that should be implemented without delay. As for the water channels in various counties of Qinghai Province, Xining, Datong, Qilian, Ledu, Minhe, and Xunhua counties have been operating for many years, and irrigation is relatively widespread. The province has applied to the central government to vigorously seek development.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>There are four secondary schools in the provincial capital, one Mongolian-Tibetan normal school, one Hui Muslim middle school, and one middle school in Ledu County. In recent years, the number of primary schools in various counties has not been small, but due to financial difficulties, equipment is incomplete. (In some rural primary schools, due to lack of funds, teachers and village chiefs have to go to the homes of students at the end of the year to collect grain as salaries.) It is difficult to compete with other provinces. As for the schools affiliated with the Qinghai Muslim Progressive Association, including primary schools in various counties and middle schools in the provincial capital, they are showing an upward trend. Recently, the Binggong construction organization has also built a Muslim high school, which will be completed by the end of the year. This is all thanks to the efforts of Master Ma, who also serves as the head of the Muslim Progressive Association, and his enthusiasm for handling education (for details on the schools under the Muslim Progressive Association system, see the statistical overview of Muslim education). In addition, Ma has also vigorously promoted Mongolian-Tibetan education, such as the Mongolian-Tibetan primary schools in Yushu County, the Mongolian-Tibetan education classes for princes and noble sons attached to the teaching department, etc., which shows his efforts in supporting special education in addition to his military duties.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>The development of transportation in Qinghai mainly relies on the cooperation of soldiers and civilians. For example, the highway from the provincial capital to Dulan, the highway from the provincial capital to the border of Gansu, the highway in Laoya Gorge, and the roads in various counties have all been completed one after another. Those that have not been completed, such as the highway from the provincial capital to Yushu and the highway into Tibet, are difficult to build without the assistance of the central government due to the long distance and the massive scale of the project.</p>

<p>(Note) (1) The Muslim schools at all levels in Xining are under the supervision and guidance of the Provincial Muslim Progressive Association, while those in various counties are under the supervision and guidance of the branches of the Muslim Progressive Association in each county. The principals of each school are appointed and dismissed by the Muslim Progressive Association and have no relationship with the provincial and county education authorities. (2) Each of these schools has recently been under the guidance of the county party headquarters in their respective locations. (3) The schools in Datong, Minhe, Hualong, and Xunhua counties were founded in the 18th year of the Republic (1929), while the rest were founded after the 20th year of the Republic (1931). (4) According to Muslim customs, Fridays are holidays for worship, and ordinary Sundays are still school days. (5) In addition to teaching religious doctrines and Arabic in the First Middle School, the remaining subjects such as Party Principles, Chinese, English, Mathematics, History, Geography, Nature, Civics, Physical Education, Music, Military Science, and extracurricular sports are the same as ordinary middle schools. In addition to Hui students, there are also Han children, but very few. There are three junior high school classes and one Arabic (i.e., Arabic) class. The construction of the high school building is still underway, and preparations are being made for expansion. The annual funding is 15,336 yuan, which is allocated by the Department of Finance, and the Muslim Progressive Association and Master Ma Bufang also provide considerable subsidies, making it the most well-funded school in Qinghai Province, so the school affairs are thriving.

<p>Sending Personnel to Investigate the Products of Inner Mongolia in Xilin Gol League and Ulanqab League</p>
<p>Opening 300,000 Mu of Opium Poppy Fields in Kailu, North Rehe</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: After Japan annexed the four northeastern provinces, it revised Tanaka's Manchurian-Mongolian policy and planned to complete its power in Manchuria and Mongolia before carrying out other conspiracies. A certain Mongolian dignitary residing in Beijing received a telegram from Bailingmiao today (16th), stating that recently, a large number of Japanese have been found traveling from Rehe to the Xilin Gol League and Ulanqab League under the guise of tourism, investigating the system of each league and banner, the tax situation, and the general livelihood of the people. The purpose is unclear. The Japanese carry maps, telescopes, cameras, and diaries, and three people carry surveying machines. Because the Xilin Gol League is located in the western part of Rehe and is an important league and banner in northern Chahar, the young intellectuals of the league are relatively educated, and the princes also have considerable power. Moreover, because the Ulanqab League is located in the northern part of Suiyuan and includes four ministries and six banners, it is an important area in Inner Mongolia. In addition, the Xilin Gol League and Ulanqab League border Outer Mongolia, which can prevent Russia and control the westward retreat of the Northeast Volunteer Army. Therefore, Japan is actively investigating Inner Mongolia, starting with the Xilin Gol League and Ulanqab League. Although Inner Mongolia is a desert area, it is rich in products. Mongolians rely solely on animal husbandry for their livelihood, and cattle, horses, sheep, camels, etc., are very abundant. Agricultural products include sorghum, wheat, pine, fir, apricot, and plum. Among the minerals, coal and iron are particularly abundant. The Japanese have long coveted this and are actively carrying out aggression.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Japanese previously planned to control the production and sale of opium in Rehe and established an Opium Monopoly Bureau in Chengde, specializing in the public sale of opium, which was contracted by the Japanese East Asia Development Company. According to people from Gubeikou, an Opium Monopoly Bureau organized by the Japanese has been found outside Gubeikou. According to people working in the bureau, the East Asia Development Company has recently enclosed 300,000 mu of land in Kailu, Rehe, specifically for growing opium. This year, there has been a huge amount of production (16th).</p>

<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The two major enemies that the Japanese army fears most in Northeast China are the Volunteer Army and Soviet Russia. Therefore, they are actively building a transportation network to facilitate military transportation in order to deal with everything. In addition to expanding the railway lines, they are also building automobile roads throughout Northeast China under the name of the puppet railway bureau, making the puppet officials responsible for management. From April of last year to March of this year, the mileage of automobile roads built by the puppet government in the past year and their operating results can be divided as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e111">Malayan Iron Mines <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Completely Controlled by the Japanese</p>
<p>Reserves About 80 Million Tons</p>
<p>Singapore Special Dispatch: The most famous specialties of the Malay Peninsula are rubber among plants and tin (i.e., tin bronze) among minerals. However, in addition to tin, there is also iron among minerals, and the production has been considerable in recent years. Unfortunately, it is all controlled by the Japanese, unlike tin mines, which are mostly operated by our overseas Chinese. The discovery of iron mines was initiated by the Japanese. Several years ago, a rubber plantation company operated by the Japanese in Malaya leased 2,000 acres of land in Johor (state name) for planting rubber trees. In this rubber plantation, a high-quality limonite ore containing 55% to 66% iron was suddenly discovered. The total area of this ore is about 800 acres. Later, several other places were discovered. Japan lacks iron ore, so it was overjoyed to find this unexpected treasure. Therefore, Japanese mining experts came one after another, sparing no effort in surveying, testing, and excavating. According to a report by the Japanese Colonial Affairs Department, the iron ore reserves in the Malay Peninsula are extremely rich. It has now been determined that there are about 80 million tons. Japanese entrepreneurs have organized three major companies to operate them. One is the Ishihara Sangyo Company, one is the Nippon Mining Company, and one is the Hōmoku Trading Company. The iron ore operated by Ishihara Company has an area of approximately 1,045 acres and a total ore content of approximately 12 million tons, which is hematite with an iron content of more than 60%. Currently, the annual production is 8,000 to 10,000 tons. The Nippon Mining Company operates in the Tugong area of ​​Terengganu. The ore area is approximately 1,080 acres, and the ore content is approximately 60 million tons. The ore is mainly magnetite, containing approximately 30% to 40% hematite, with an iron content of more than 60%. The current annual production is 300,000 to 400,000 tons, and it is expected to increase to 600,000 to 700,000 tons next year. The Hōmoku Company operates in the Peton station of Kedah. The hematite contains 60% iron, and the ore content is approximately 5 million tons. Most of the ore produced by the three companies is sold to the Nippon Steel Corporation, which charges 10 Straits dollars per ton, making a profit of approximately 2 to 3 yuan. The Nippon Steel Corporation then transports the ore back to Japan for smelting. Because the Malay Peninsula lacks coal and Japan is closer to this place than European countries, the iron ore of the Malay Peninsula has to be completely controlled by the Japanese.

<p>The Current Situation in Qinghai</p>
<p>Qinghai, named for the lake, is located upstream of the major rivers. It borders Gansu to the northeast, Xinjiang to the northwest, and Sichuan, Xikang, and Tibet to the south. The province has a total area of 2,562,500 square li (according to figures released by the Qinghai Provincial Department of Civil Affairs) and a population of approximately 6.2 million. In ancient times, it was the land of the Western Qiang, with its fortunes rising and falling throughout history and various names being used. During the Qing dynasty, the Xining Prefecture and various Mongol and Tibetan tribes were established, all under the jurisdiction of Gansu. After the establishment of the province in the early Republic of China, only seven counties originally under the jurisdiction of the Xining Prefecture were included: Xining, Nianbo (now Ledu and Minhe), Datong, Qunyuan, Guide, Xunhua, and Bayong (now Hualong County). Later, eight more counties were added: Gonghe, Qumyyan, Tongren, Minhe, Huzhu, Yushu, Dulan, and Nangqian (of which Gonghe, Yushu, Dulan, and Nangqian were newly converted from native chieftainries, while the remaining four were split from the original seven counties). The northwestern part of the province has a particularly large area, with the three counties of Yushu, Dulan, and Nangqian alone requiring the establishment of additional county administrations for political, national defense, and economic reasons. The current provincial authorities are planning for this. Yesterday, the reporter visited the provincial government and, due to Chairman Ma Lin's return to his hometown, was received by Secretary-General Feng Guorui and provincial commissioners Tan Kemin and Yao Jun, who provided a detailed account of the current situation in Qinghai.</p>
<p>Qinghai is located in a remote border region, close to powerful neighbors, and with a complex ethnic composition, making governance extremely difficult. Since the establishment of the province, only a few years have passed, but the authorities have devoted most of their efforts to securing the borders, defending against threats, and harmonizing relations between the various ethnic groups. Although various plans have not been realized due to severe financial difficulties, they have overcome numerous obstacles in difficult circumstances, building up military industries and developing stocks, striving to improve transportation, developing education for all ethnic groups, fostering harmony between Mongols and Tibetans, and seeking to advance various undertakings to the best of their ability. Those tasks that were considered essential and were immediately undertaken have either achieved remarkable results and established a basic framework, or have been presented in plans and are being developed. If the people of the country provide effective assistance and progress is made without hindrance, then the future of Qinghai holds endless promise. The central government is determined to develop the Northwest as a foundation for recovering lost territories and has moved from the stage of propaganda to practical implementation. Following the westward visits of Dai and Song, their recommendations for urgently addressing important policies related to animal husbandry, health, relief, and the economy in Qinghai have been discussed and planned with the provincial authorities. These plans have now been approved by the central government and their implementation is expected soon. A brief account of the current situation in Qinghai in terms of administration, economy, animal husbandry, water conservancy, education, and transportation is provided below.</p>
<p>Administration</p>
<p>Although the ethnic minorities in Qinghai are numerous and diverse, with unique customs, the provincial authorities have consistently adopted a broad policy over the past twenty years, responding with composure and achieving a harmonious and peaceful coexistence.</p>
<p>Economy</p>
<p>Although Qinghai Province has a vast territory, most of the twenty counties, except for the ten or so counties in Haidong, are barren and infertile. The entire provincial budget relies on the revenue from these ten or so counties for its maintenance, making it extremely difficult. Furthermore, in terms of tax revenue, the province relies entirely on the production of wool, which is transported to Tianjin for sale. In recent years, due to delays in transportation and poor sales, the fur trade has stagnated, severely impacting the economy. (The original price of wool was six to seven yuan per dan, plus local export taxes, transit taxes in Ningxia and Suiyuan, and transportation costs. By the time it reached the sales destination, the cost was already around thirty yuan per dan, but the selling price was sometimes even lower. At other times, prices soared, but it was impossible to rush the goods, resulting in unsold wool. Heavy taxation and inconvenient transportation are the real issues.) Recently, at the National Finance Conference, the representative from Qinghai proposed the establishment of a Central Bank branch in Qinghai and assistance with funding for the Qinghai Provincial Government, which were both approved. If this happens, the difficulties will be alleviated and the administration will naturally be able to exert more effort.</p>
<p>Animal Husbandry</p>
<p>The northwest and south of Qinghai are grazing grounds for Mongols and Tibetans, so cattle, sheep, and livestock thrive, making it one of the largest pastures in Northwest China. However, the local people adhere to old customs, do not know how to improve breeds, and generally do not pay attention to hygiene. When livestock encounter disease, they are helpless and leave it to fate, so the quantity and quality are declining day by day. If active measures are not taken, the future is extremely worrying. It has now been decided by the National Economic Commission to allocate 200,000 yuan to manage animal husbandry in Qinghai, establish a hospital, and establish veterinary hygiene agencies in various counties to promote improvements. The future of animal husbandry is promising.</p>
<p>Water Conservancy</p>
<p>Qinghai is the source of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, with a very high terrain, averaging over 3,000 feet above sea level. The rivers flow down from high altitudes with great force. In the event of rain, they carry sediment downstream, and the provinces of Shandong, Henan, and other provinces downstream are prone to flooding. Therefore, when discussing the governance of the Yellow River, extreme attention should be paid to the upper reaches of Qinghai first. At the first meeting of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission last year (1933), the representative from Qinghai, Liu Ruzhen, proposed the establishment of the Gansu-Qinghai-Ningxia Water Conservancy Bureau to dig canals, build embankments, afforest, and measure water levels. This is a crucial plan that cannot be delayed. As for the water canals in various counties of Qinghai, those in Xining, Datong, Qumyyan, Ledu, Minhe, and Xunhua have been in operation for many years and are generally widespread. An application has been submitted to the central government to strive for development.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>The provincial capital has four secondary schools, one Mongol-Tibetan normal school, and one Hui Muslim middle school. The number of primary schools in various counties has increased in recent years, but due to financial difficulties, equipment is incomplete (in some rural primary schools, teachers and village chiefs have to go to students' homes at the end of the year to collect grain as wages due to lack of funds). They can only maintain the current situation and cannot compete with other provinces. The Qinghai Muslim Education Promotion Association has been enthusiastic in its efforts. (The Muslim middle schools are showing an upward trend. The military industry is also constructing a Muslim high school, which will be completed by the end of the year. All this is due to the enthusiastic efforts of Commander Ma, who also heads the Muslim Education Promotion Association. (For details on the schools under the Muslim Education Promotion Association system, see the Statistical Overview of Muslim Education.) In addition, Ma is also actively promoting Mongol-Tibetan education, such as the Mongol-Tibetan primary school in Yushu County and the Mongol-Tibetan prince and noble education class attached to the military headquarters. This demonstrates his efforts to support special education in his spare time from military affairs.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>The development of transportation in Qinghai relies heavily on the efforts of the military industry and the cooperation of the people. Roads such as the highway from the provincial capital to Dulan, the highway from the provincial capital to the Gansu border, the Laoyaxia highway, and the roads in various counties have all been completed one after another. Those that have not been completed, such as the highway from the provincial capital to Yushu and the highway into Tibet, are difficult to construct without central government assistance due to the long distances and large scale of the project.</p>

<p>(Notes) (1) The Muslim schools at all levels in Xining are supervised and guided by the Provincial Muslim Education Promotion Association, while those in various counties are supervised and guided by the branches of the Muslim Education Promotion Association in each county. The principals of each school are appointed and dismissed by the Muslim Education Promotion Association and are not related to the provincial and county education authorities. (2) Recently, each school has been guided by the Party Department of each county. (3) The dates of establishment of each school are: Datong, Minhe, Hualong, and Xunhua in 1929, and the rest after 1931. (4) In accordance with Muslim customs, Friday is a weekly holiday, and ordinary Sundays are still classes as usual. (5) In addition to teaching religious doctrine and Arabic in the First Middle School, the remaining subjects such as Party doctrine, Chinese, English, mathematics, history, geography, nature, civics, physical education, music, and military science, as well as extracurricular activities, are the same as ordinary middle schools. In addition to Muslims, there are also children of Han people, but very few. There are three classes in junior high school and one class in Arabic. The high school building is still under construction and is preparing to expand. The total annual funding is 15,336 yuan, allocated by the Department of Finance. The Muslim Education Promotion Association and Commander Ma Bufang also provide considerable subsidies, making it the most well-funded school in Qinghai, so the school is thriving.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Each County Builds Dams for Flood Control <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Breach in Southern Hebei Floods into Shandong</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: After the breaches at Jiugulu Menggangji in Changyuan, Southern Hebei, additional breaches occurred at Jiaozhai, Qiangqingshankou, and other nearby locations, creating a situation reminiscent of the Shitouzhai breach last year. The turbulent floodwaters rushed northeast, passing through Hua County in Henan and Puyang in Hebei, before entering Shandong. According to reports from the Department of Civil Affairs, the floodwaters have already entered Shandong today (15th), passing through Puyang and Fan counties. Governor Han Fuqu is deeply concerned about this and has instructed Department Director Li Shuchun to urgently telegraph Puyang, Fan, Yanggu, Shouzhang, and other counties along the watercourse to mobilize laborers to quickly build dams for defense, in order to prevent fields and homes from being swept away. Director Zhang Lianjia of the River Affairs Bureau is still inspecting the upper reaches and directing the counties to build dikes for flood control. Since the breach at Changyuan, the water level in the main river has dropped sharply. Today, the water level upstream of Shaan County is 291.6 meters, a decrease of 3.43 meters compared to the highest water level on the 10th. The water level in our province has also stabilized, with only slight fluctuations and generally stable conditions. According to a telegram from County Magistrate Zhang Zhixi of Dongping County to the Department of Civil Affairs, the floodwaters in the county have receded by 5 centimeters, and it is hoped that they will be out of danger if the water does not rise again.

<h3 id="e117">Extending the Term of Pledges <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Intended to Consider the Hardships of the Poor But Wuhu Pawnshops Hold Different Views</p>
<p>Wuhu Communication: The Anhui Provincial Government, in order to consider the hardships of the poor, has changed the rule of 18 months for pledges in the province, extending it by two months, and extending the overdue period from five days to ten days, while the interest rate remains at 2.5%. This new rule takes into account both the pawnshops and the pledgers. The most pawnshops in the province are in Wuhu, and the capital is also relatively strong. The provincial government has specially ordered the Wuhu Second District Commissioner's Office and the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce to earnestly guide and comply with the policy. However, pawnshops such as Changde, Tonghe, Huiyuan, and Xincheng in the port believe that the capital is limited, and they usually rely on bank loans. In recent years, the silver market has become tight, and banks cannot lend money, making it difficult to manage. In addition, a drought has formed locally, and nine out of ten rural homes are empty. In recent months, poor people from nearby areas have come to Wuhu to pawn their belongings, but only one in ten can redeem them. If the term of the goods is extended by two months, and the overdue period is extended from five days to ten days, the loss of hidden interest will be significant. Currently, there is a trend of not having money to meet the market. If the above-mentioned methods are implemented, they plan to stop pawning and wait for redemption. The above-mentioned opinions were requested to be presented by Tao Yutang, a standing committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, to Governor Liu Zhenhua when he inspected Wuhu a few days ago, and then the association submitted a petition to the Commissioner's Office to forward it to the Department of Finance, requesting the provincial government to reconsider the proposal and allow it to be postponed. However, all parties believe that pawnshops are the only means of turnover for the poor on weekdays, and pawnshops in the inland areas have nothing else but clothing and accessories. The pawn price is less than 30% of the original price, and even if the interest rate is high, they have to endure it. However, if the money is not available for a while, the clothes will be in danger of being forfeited. The provincial government's new approach to extending the term is really considerate of the people's difficulties. Now the pawnshops do not think so and intend to stop pawning and wait for redemption, which seems to be blackmail. Therefore, they also oppose the demands of the pawnshops, and the provincial government has also ordered the pawnshops to share the difficulties and not to overstate their words. (15th)</p>

<h3 id="e118">Repercussions of Jinshan's Unauthorized Demarcation of County Boundaries <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Fishery Association and Education Association of this county believe that Jinshan County has independently demarcated the boundary, intending to include the Jinshanwei Sanyao Beicang Xiaoguantun in the eighth district of Punan in this county into the jurisdiction of Jin County, without soliciting the consent of this county. They are proceeding unilaterally only on the grounds that the area is small. The reasons are not sufficient, and the designated boundary lines are neither natural nor clear. Furthermore, they do not comply with the promulgated boundary demarcation regulations. If this becomes a reality, there will be many disputes in the future if each county follows the precedent and changes the county boundary. All sectors of the local community can hardly tolerate this, so they have submitted detailed reasons and telegraphed the provincial and county authorities to express their opposition.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Department of Finance Dispatches Committee to Investigate Miscellaneous Taxes <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Since the Department of Finance of this province promulgated the establishment of county treasuries and ordered each county to bring local miscellaneous taxes under the management of the county government's Miscellaneous Tax Collection Office, this has been circulated as a file. Now, in order to clarify whether the Miscellaneous Tax Collection Office of each county has been organized and established, and whether the various miscellaneous taxes are collected according to the budget, and whether there are any unbudgeted or abolished taxes that are still being collected, personnel are dispatched to inspect separately. However, the Miscellaneous Tax Collection Office of this county has been established and collected by Ke Zhang Zhao, the chief of the transportation department, who was appointed by the county magistrate as the director. Zhu Jiliang, who was commissioned by the Department of Finance, came to Songjiang yesterday to investigate in great detail.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Wuxi cargo steamship transportation originally had Gongmao, Taichang, and Xiexing three shipping companies, and the business was quite developed. However, due to business competition, fares were reduced one after another, resulting in annual losses for each company. Recently, it was agreed that the three shipping companies would cooperate to jointly transport, rectify water transport prices, and eliminate the previous competition and seizure. The Zhonghua Company, which has the earliest start and the most substantial content among the Wuxi-Liyang passenger services, also believes that the highways and provincial roads in each county have been completed one after another, and the passenger steamships have become the end of a spent arrow. Therefore, the chairman of the company, Shi Youhua Yi, decided to add Shanghai-Wuxi freight services and handle remittances, and specially prepared five express steamships such as Hengfa to start daily. The application has been approved by the Maritime Administration and the governments of Shanghai and Wuxi counties to give instructions for protection.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Dispute Over Demolition of Wasteland Dam Not Yet Resolved <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The dispute over the demolition of the wasteland dam at the junction of Wuxi and Jiangyin, caused by Zhou Weizhi, the chief of Gushan Township in Jiangyin, who demolished it without authorization, has been sent to the Construction Department, which urgently telegraphed the governments of Wuxi and Jiangyin counties to investigate and handle it strictly, and sent Wang Yuanyi, an engineer from the department, to conduct an impartial survey. The towns of Gushan and Chenshu have successively sent telegrams to the Construction Department to appeal. Gushan Township is determined to demolish it quickly, while Chenshu Township is trying to avoid conflict. Therefore, the Gushan side has gathered hundreds of villagers to demolish the dam base and rebuild the bridge overnight, thinking that success will not be destroyed. Villagers from Chenshu Township guarded it on the night of the 6th, fearing that the dispute has not yet been resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Opposition to Land Price Declaration <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Land Price Declaration Office of this county has recently appointed Gui Wochen, Yang Shoumei, Qian Sunqing, and others as auxiliary committee members in accordance with the provincial regulations. After Qian and others were appointed, they were afraid of rashly accepting the appointment because the matter was in its initial stage, so they telegraphed their fellow villagers in Beijing and Shanghai to ask for guidance, and the public organizations of this county jointly telegraphed the yuan road, the provincial department, and the provincial hall to request that the policy be stopped by clear order because we are still in the period of political tutelage and must not increase the burden on the people. The standing committee meeting of the Auxiliary Committee decided to postpone it for one month. It is now known that Zhang Yiu Ou, Jiang Zudai, Cai Pei, Wang Kunlun, and others, residents of this county living in Beijing, believe that the land price declaration should be held from the beginning of autonomy in accordance with the Prime Minister's Outline of National Construction, and that the increase in land price is still shared by the people of the whole county. Furthermore, for example, Chapter 2 of the Fourth Book of the Land Law (Declaration and Estimation of Land Price) has focused on occupancy estimation, and the ownership has the right to raise objections to the land administration agency's valuation and request the convening of arbitrators for arbitration. Furthermore, Chapter 8 of the Tax Arrears Regulations stipulates that within three years, only 5% annual interest will be collected on the amount owed, and only after three years of arrears will the land be auctioned, which has obviously abandoned the theory of (reporting prices are not actually collected according to the reported price) and (failure to report within the time limit is regarded as ownerless land). The methods formulated by Jiangsu Province this time do not follow the law, which is incomprehensible, and the proposals to declare in the cities of Wuxi and Nantong from July 1 of this year, and the proposals for collecting land tax, are also without legal basis. Therefore, they telegraphed Yang Hanxi and others from the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting that the citizens of Tongxi be jointly presented to the government, the court, and the ministry to strive according to law.</p>

<p>The County Anti-Smoking Association has recently resolved to implement mandatory registration from August 1st because opium smokers are waiting and seeing about the registration issue. Cao Junzai has now been assigned to be responsible for the 1st, 3rd, and 2nd districts, Chen Junyi is responsible for the 4th and 7th districts, Jin Feng is responsible for the 2nd and 8th districts, and Qian Hongkui is responsible for the 5th and 6th districts. It has been decided to go to the designated districts next Monday to implement mandatory registration of opium smokers. As for the anti-smoking cases, they have been ordered to be handled by the Anti-Smoking Association. The association sent letters to the County Judicial Bureau and the Public Security Bureau on the 16th, requesting that anti-smoking cases be referred to the association for review in the future.</p>

<p>The native cloth of Tongyi has seen its sales plummet from 8 million bolts to 700,000 bolts because unscrupulous merchants disregard credit and cheat for profit. Local groups are now deliberating remedies and have decided to establish a large-scale native cloth market in the open space in front of the Women's Normal School in the south of the city, concentrate cloth merchants to collect goods, and implement inspections.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Security Department stated that Liu Liansheng, a reserve soldier of the Machine Gun Company of the Second Battalion of the Fourth Regiment, absconded with weapons on the 8th of last month from the Nanxing Bridge garrison and went to Pingwang Town, Wujiang, Jiangsu Province, where he shot and killed the fisherman Gu Fulong and his family of four. He then used the alias Liu Yuhua and joined the Fourth Training Brigade as a soldier. He was found by the Fourth Regiment, brought back for interrogation, and sentenced to death. Yesterday (17th) at 8 a.m., he was escorted to the execution ground outside Qintai Gate and executed by shooting.</p>

Her right leg was run over, leaving her disabled. The traffic police arrested the driver and took him to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Shi Baoting, a textile worker from Huzhou, came to Hangzhou after losing his job, but failed to find any friends and ran out of money. He became disillusioned with the world and committed suicide by drowning in the Songmuchi River. He was rescued by passers-by and sent to the Public Security Bureau, who raised travel expenses to persuade him to return to his hometown. Zhang Xin, a partner at the Zhongnan Pharmacy in Hangzhou and a native of Xiaoshan, had been unemployed for a long time and was in dire straits. Yesterday, he committed suicide by swallowing sleeping pills in Room 49 of the Huaxing Hotel. He was discovered by the tea room the next morning and rushed to the hospital for treatment, where he was fortunately revived.</p>

A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday morning that the ships of each company go directly to the provincial capital, which proves that Fuzhou is indeed very peaceful and the rumors are inaccurate. If there were a war in the suburbs of Fuzhou, shipping would inevitably be affected and suspended.</p>

<p>Dredging of Xiaoqing River Will Be Proposed at Water Conservancy Conference</p>
<p>Denying the Rumor that the Economic Commission Controls Grain</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Commission, returned south from Qingdao to Jinan and arrived in Beijing the morning before yesterday. He then took a special express train back to Shanghai at 5 p.m. He arrived at the wharf at 11:30 p.m. and got off the train at the Zhenru Station. Yesterday morning at 11 a.m., he met with reporters from various newspapers at the Shanghai office of the Economic Commission on West Xiangsi Road to talk about the trip. The following is a summary of his conversation.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Shandong Province's Agricultural Production Bumper Harvest This Year <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Song Ziwen first said that he was invited by Chairman Han (Fuqu) to study the province's economic plan. After inspecting Qingdao and Jinan, he learned that Shandong had a very good harvest this year. Cotton and wheat production was very strong, and peanut production was even more abundant. Now, we are further promoting sales and transporting them to Guangdong and other provinces, which has led to higher selling prices.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Jinan Textile Mill Can Actually Make a Profit <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Especially the textile mills in Jinan left the best impression on me. Two of them use the latest machines, the 1933 and 1934 models, which makes their production capacity very strong. Another factory uses machines that are partly made by the factory itself, and the required price can be reduced by more than two-thirds compared with imported products. In addition, the workers in Shandong Province are hardworking and can endure hardship, and their wages are very low. The textile mills in Shanghai are in a slump, but the textile mills in Jinan can still make a profit, which is really fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Lu Province's Financial Revenue and Expenditure Offset <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The finances of all provinces in the country are causing panic, but Lu Province is an exception. The provincial government's revenue and expenditure are sufficient to offset each other, there is no deficit, the people's burden has not increased, nor has it been seen to increase.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Xiaoqing River Dredging Plan <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Yellow River has breached its banks in many places, and Lu Province is greatly alarmed by the potential for the turbulent waters to invade. Regarding the dredging of the Xiaoqing River, Chairman Han's original plan was to ensure that large ships of 600 tons could directly enter a suitable location in the future, and secondly, that ships of 200 tons could directly reach Jinan. In terms of engineering, it is planned to build several dams to equalize the water volume. Lu Province has already spent 700,000 to 800,000 on this, and another 2 million is needed. It is proposed to ask the Economic Commission for assistance. The Economic Commission will refer this to the soon-to-be-established Water Conservancy Commission for discussion and decision.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Qingdao's Construction Has Achieved Considerable Success <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Song continued, regarding the construction of Qingdao City, there is much to tell. Everything is more developed than when it was in the hands of the Germans and Japanese. Mayor Shen Honglie is particularly attentive to the lives of the people, building several affordable housing units with rent of only one yuan per month. There are also many emerging public works, among which the establishment of an agricultural improvement agency is particularly effective. All improved varieties of cattle, sheep, pigs, cotton, wheat, etc., are provided free of charge to farmers in the surrounding villages. This kind of work started in Qingdao City. In addition, the government encourages people to grow fruit. However, people are hesitant because of economic difficulties, as it takes five or six years to harvest fruit. However, the city government believes that this is related to international trade and is currently planning to find ways to subsidize it to make people willing to participate.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Informal Discussion of Diplomacy <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Song continued, saying that his trip to Qingdao was purely for summer vacation and that his meeting with Ambassador Yan (Huijing) and Minister Gu was accidental and not pre-arranged. After meeting, they talked casually. Of course, diplomacy was also discussed in casual conversation, but there was absolutely no consultation or decision-making. As for suggestions to the government, Ambassador Yan is suffering from heart disease and still needs to go to Peiping to the Xiehe Hospital for diagnosis and treatment, and his return to duty is temporarily undecided. Minister Gu is still staying in Qingdao, and I don't know when he will return to his post. I have not heard about the rumor that Minister Gu is advocating for the conclusion of a non-aggression pact among Pacific countries. Mr. Wang Kemin's visit to Qingdao this time was a normal social courtesy between friends and did not involve any official business.</p>

<p>Mr. Song answered reporters' questions, saying that loan applications to the Economic Commission from various parties, such as for the construction of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, are still under negotiation and no decision has been made. Of course, no contract has been signed yet. I have not yet received a telegram regarding when Dr. Lacis will come to China. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry are handling the matter of rescuing the yarn factories operated by Mr. Rong Zongjing, which is not related to the Economic Commission. Although the Economic Commission has a Cotton Industry Control Committee, the work of the Cotton Industry Control Committee is mostly of a permanent nature, and this type of temporary relief is not within its scope.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Mr. Song Denies Forming a Control Committee <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Silk merchants' leaders such as Chu Fucheng have requested the government to control the silk industry. Matters such as improving silkworm breeds require huge amounts of money. The Economic Commission's financial resources are limited, so it remains to be studied whether it can be done. Mr. Song then denied to reporters the report that the Economic Commission was planning to form a Grain Control Committee, saying that the Economic Commission currently has no such plan. This may be a misunderstanding of the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau established by the Ministry of Finance. Finally, reporters asked for his opinion on the outflow of silver from our country. Mr. Song replied that it is said that 15 million of our country's silver has flowed out recently, which deserves attention. I will jointly study the advantages and disadvantages with people from the banking sector to determine the advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>Mr. Song also told reporters that his trip to Sichuan has not been decided yet, because after returning to Shanghai, he needs to rest for a while and there are some official duties that need to be dealt with urgently.

<p>Purchasing Twin-Engine Lockheed Aircraft from the United States by Telegram</p>
<p>Building Weather Stations and Radio Stations</p>
<p>[Shen Shi News Agency] The Civil Aviation Corporation's planned air routes to Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan have been allocated 250,000 yuan by the Ministry of Communications to start operations. The company has ordered the latest Lockheed twin-engine aircraft from the United States, and the construction of radio stations and weather stations along the route are being planned. It is expected to officially open before January next year. Mr. Dai Enji, manager of the China Aviation Corporation, made the following statement yesterday:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Ministry Allocates 250,000 Yuan <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The plan to open air routes from Chongqing through Guiyang to Yunnan has long been submitted by the Civil Aviation Corporation, and has been test-flown twice. It has now been approved by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications, and 250,000 yuan has been allocated by the Ministry of Communications to start operations. It has been decided that 150,000 yuan will be used to purchase aircraft, 20,000 yuan for transportation, and the remaining 80,000 yuan for other equipment.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Ordering New Lockheed Aircraft <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The stopping points for the Sichuan-Guizhou-Yunnan air routes have been decided as Chongqing, Guiyang, and Kunming. The Civil Aviation Corporation has now reached an agreement with the governments of Guizhou and Yunnan, and there are no problems with airport facilities. The distance between the points is 420 kilometers from Chongqing to Guiyang and from Guiyang to Kunming. The company has now decided to order a Lockheed twin-engine aircraft from the United States for 50,000 US dollars. The speed of the aircraft is 380 kilometers per hour, so it can reach a one-way trip in about three hours when it opens. It can be returned on the same day. The aircraft can be shipped to Shanghai after being ordered from the United States. The line can be officially opened before January of next year at the latest.</p>

<p>In addition, because the terrain of the line is very high, with many high mountains and ridges along the line, and the climate is harsh, in order to maintain flight safety, the company has prepared 80,000 yuan in cash in addition to ordering special twin-engine aircraft from the United States. Order radio and electrical stations, install radio stations at the Guizhou and Yunnan stations, and set up weather stations at points on the line that impede flight, so as to report weather changes at any time and ensure safety.

<h3 id="e145">Import of Foreign Rice Gradually Decreases <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Because Supply and Demand Are Still Appropriate, Market Prices and People's Hearts Are Gradually Stabilized</p>
<p>In order to regulate the people's food and stabilize rice prices, the Municipal Social Bureau has specially stipulated measures for registering the import of foreign rice and instructed rice merchants to implement them. A reporter from Shenshi News Agency learned from the bureau yesterday that this year's drought has caused merchants to purchase foreign rice in droves to speculate and profit. Some of them ordered early and have only now arrived, or they are deliberately transporting them at this time to seek good prices. However, the impact on the national economy is very large, and the excessive import of foreign rice will inevitably lead to a drop in rice prices, which will have a disastrous impact on the harvest of our country's farmers in the future. Since the drought, rice merchants have hoarded rice and waited for higher prices. All the rice of the farmers has fallen into the hands of merchants. If more is imported, the price will inevitably fall back. This matter can be expected to be resolved naturally. The registration of foreign rice is a last resort. If you want to cure the root cause, you must accumulate grain early to prevent hunger. However, although the authorities have seen this, they have not been able to implement it due to limited funds. In the past week, imported foreign rice has either been registered directly with the Social Bureau or forwarded to the Social Bureau by the Rice Industry Association, and taxes have been paid according to law, but the number is extremely small. Recently, the Rice Industry Association claimed that the import of foreign rice has decreased significantly. The reason for this is nothing more than the gradual stabilization of rice prices and the gradual peace of mind of the people. According to the current situation, the import of foreign rice has gradually decreased. If there are no recent changes, the temporarily promulgated measures for the import of foreign rice will be cancelled.</p>

<p>However, For the Sake of Prudence,</p>
<p>A Deposit Tax Must Be Paid Temporarily</p>
<p>[Dagong News Agency] After the Jianghai Customs mistakenly identified 15,000 bags of rice transported from Xiamen to Shanghai as foreign rice and seized them for tax evasion, the Xiamen Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Cereal Association proved that it was new Zhangzhou rice. The customs authorities specially invited experts to take samples for inspection yesterday. The result confirmed that it was domestic product, and it was allowed to pay a deposit tax and unload. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e147">Reasons for Detention <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Zhangzhou in Fujian Province was originally a rice-producing area, but the area of ​​fields is not large and the annual output is limited. Due to transportation difficulties, it has never been transported to other provinces for sale. This year, the climate is extremely dry, and the agricultural production in several provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been greatly reduced, and prices in Shanghai have soared. Sixteen companies in the area, including Detai, Jinrui, Huilong, and Fuji, purchased the new rice produced by the people, totaling more than 20,000 stones. The first two batches of 5,000 bags were transported to Shanghai in the middle of last month. This time, the Yuezhou, Fuping, Nanchang, Qingyuan, Hanjiang, and other ships loaded 15,000 bags at Xiamen Customs and transported them to Shanghai. The Shanghai Customs authorities believed that Nissin rice has been disguised and routed through Xiamen, evading taxes and transporting it to the interior for dumping. Rumors are rampant, so for rice imports, it is ordered to conduct strict inspections. When the Yuezhou and other ships arrived at the port last week, they recognized Zhang rice as foreign rice and immediately implemented the detention. After the implementation of the new tax rules, the city</p>

<p>Since the Zhangzhou new rice was detained by the customs, the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce and the Quanzhang Zeng Hall telegraphed the Municipal Cereal Industry Association to the Shanghai Customs for certification and release. The customs specially invited rice merchants' leader Gu Xinyi and customs grain experts yesterday to publicly inspect the results. The rice quality and color were completely different from foreign rice, and the rice body was slightly damp, which was undoubtedly new rice. The production period of new rice in Saigon, Taiwan, Siam, etc., must be until the end of November due to climate reasons. The foreign rice currently sold on the market is all old rice stored in warehouses and has no moisture.</p>

The 15,000 bags of rice detained will temporarily pay the deposit tax at the tax rate of Xiamen Customs and then be released for unloading. If it is confirmed that the rice is produced in Zhangzhou, the deposit tax will be refunded. If it is found to be foreign rice evading taxes, in addition to confiscating the entire deposit tax, it will be punished according to regulations.</p>

<p>Using Assets of More Than 1.5 Million as Guarantee for Fixed Deposits</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Industrial Trust Company was established by the Shanghai Municipal Government as a municipal business organization. It has been less than a year since its establishment in October of last year, and the progress of its business has been extremely rapid. The company is now holding 1.5 million yuan in guaranteed fixed deposits, using assets of more than 1.5 million yuan as guarantee to seek the safest guarantee for citizens' deposits. This method is still only seen in the operation of trust business. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e165">The Mission of the Trust Company <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The company's mission is to focus on handling various trust and transportation businesses, so that citizens can get various benefits. The municipal ferry operated by the company is one proof of this. In addition to handling trust business, other production, insurance, and trust departments also focus on the construction of public utilities, the transfer of urban real estate, and the development of small-capital businesses. The company is willing to do what others are unwilling to do or hesitate to do, and strives to do it for the welfare of the general public.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Guaranteed Fixed Deposits <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>What the company hopes for from the public most is that the public can enjoy the company's services and cooperate closely with the company. After deliberation by the company's board of directors and supervisors, it was decided to hold 1.5 million yuan in guaranteed fixed trust deposits to open a safe investment path for the public. The so-called guarantee refers to the company's assets as a guarantee for deposits, so this deposit is absolutely reliable.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Double Investment Guarantee <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The company's municipal ferry assets are currently valued at more than 743,000 yuan, and the real estate department's assets are currently valued at more than 773,000 yuan, totaling more than 1.5 million yuan. After inspection and verification by the company's directors, supervisors, and accountants, they are used as a guarantee for this fixed deposit. In addition, after receiving this fixed deposit of 1.5 million yuan, it must be used in the most profitable way to seek the safest guarantee for depositors, which is another layer of guarantee. Therefore, this deposit has an absolute double-layer guarantee.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Proof of Directors and Supervisors <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The company's directors, such as Xu Xinliu, Wu Yunzhai, Cai Zengji, Li Fuxun, Qin Runqing, Guo Shun, Feng Bingnan, Jin Liren, Shen Yi, Xu Peihuang, Xu Fu, and supervisors such as Lin Kanghou, Yu Hongjun, Wu Zixiang, etc., are all leaders in the financial world, and secretaries and directors of the municipal government. The company's assets are now listed in a table, stamped for certification, and verified and stamped by accountant Xie Lin. Afterwards, all assets will be inspected and advertised by an accountant every six months to show great credibility. Moreover, the proof of the company's directors and supervisors is the same as the fund custody, so the guarantee for depositors is extremely solid. The company also has a "Description of Guaranteed Fixed Trust Deposits," which details the company's assets and the interest rate of fixed deposits in great detail. Citizens who need to read it can send a letter to No. 66 Tianjin Road to the company for collection.</p>

<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Shenxin Textile Corporation was temporarily stagnant in its financial turnover due to the impact of the world's economic downturn. However, since the reinstatement of General Manager Rong Zongjing, on the one hand, due to the best efforts of the financial community to maintain it, and on the other hand, due to the Shenxin's own efforts to improve, the recent situation has greatly improved. According to the Shenxin Corporation, Rong Weiren, chairman of the company's Improvement Committee, hosted the news</p>

<p>We were able to see the general writing room of the association, which is located in the eastern part of the downstairs of the corporation and occupies a very large area. There are currently more than 30 office staff members, all of whom are excellent members transferred from the corporation and various factories. When we visited, they were all buried in writing and working very hard. It is divided into three groups: general affairs, factory affairs, and business affairs, which adopt a division of labor and cooperation system, and is led by the Improvement Committee. The organization is quite scientific. After the visit, Mr. Rong made the following remarks: The unfortunate incident of Shenxin was in fact entirely due to the adverse effects of the world's economic downturn. However, in the current global economic downturn, it would be difficult for such a large industry as Shenxin to compete with the international market if it did not</p>

<p>In view of this, the company specially organized the Improvement Committee after the reinstatement of the general manager to take full responsibility for seeking to improve all aspects of the company. The members of the committee are not limited to the highest-level personnel of the original factories, and at the same time, they also try their best to invite textile experts from China and abroad to collect and absorb opinions widely and work together to improve. The staff members are mostly excellent members transferred from the corporation and various factories, because they are relatively skilled and can save money. Since the establishment of the Improvement Committee and the opening of the office, the work has been quite intensive. After this storm, the staff of the nine factories of the company have also shared the same firm determination. Recently, the factory staff requested the Improvement Committee to voluntarily</p>

<p>This is a solid proof of their awareness. At present, the salaries of all employees of the company have been changed to 80% of the actual amount, but the work is more effortful than before. This situation is really gratifying. ("If there is no invincible country abroad, the country will always perish.") Shenxin can be said to have been fortunate to have encountered setbacks in order to be more energetic. At present, both the symptomatic and fundamental treatments have been grasped, and the market price of yarn is also improving day by day. It is expected that the new flower will be on the market soon, and the situation will improve. The internal colleagues often encourage each other with "hard work and hard work" in order to overcome this difficult situation and regain the road to prosperity. On the one hand, we still hope that our government and the financial community can take into account this existing large-scale industry that is only preserved by the people and give it considerable maintenance, so that the future of Shenxin will be more hopeful.</p>

<h3 id="e174">City-Wide Power Plant Interconnection <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Principles for Mutual Power Supply Established Between Three Companies / Convening Various Power Companies to Standardize Electrical Practices. The power and electricity for the public concessions, Nanshi, and Zhabei areas of this city are supplied by three major power companies: Shanghai Electric Power Company, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, and China Merchants Electricity Company. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, recognizing that the electrical business is crucial to the safety of the city and the power source for factories, and that any accident at a power plant would have far-reaching consequences and endless troubles, decided to implement a city-wide power grid unification plan. It convened the aforementioned three companies to discuss interconnection methods. This interconnection cooperation plan is overseen by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities. If any electrical company experiences a shortage of power supply or an unexpected accident, other companies can immediately provide power, preventing adverse effects such as power outages. This plan requires the special adjustment of one generator and two large cables connecting the three electrical companies. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has drafted the principles regarding expenses and other procedures and is currently actively consulting with all relevant parties to complete the city-wide power grid unification plan as soon as possible.

<p>Optimistic Prospects for Controlled Production. Since the establishment of the American Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee in Shanghai, it has sent personnel to Xuchang, Yuxian, Jiaxian, Xiangcheng, and other counties to inspect the lives of local farmers, collect statistics on local production, and test the quality of the products. According to the survey, Jiaxian has the highest production and the best quality. It is reported that the committee has formulated tens of thousands of copies of "Guidelines for American Tobacco Leaves" because the time for curing new leaves is approaching. The guidelines detail the various procedures for transplanting, cultivation, harvesting, and kiln dimensions and will be distributed to farmers. The committee has also requested its executive committee member Mr. Wu Ting Sheng to personally provide guidance. Mr. Wu took the night train to Beijing last night and will transfer to the north. According to Mr. Wu, the mission is not only to improve tobacco leaves but also to improve tobacco seeds. The first step is to prohibit farmers from saving seeds. All tobacco seeds will be distributed by the committee free of charge. In the long run, this will prevent self-destruction. Then, the committee will distribute seeds according to the annual needs, preventing overproduction and harm to both parties. The future is very optimistic.</p>

<p>Participating in the Confucius Memorial Ceremony on the 27th. Qufu is the hometown of Confucius, the sage of Confucianism, and the Confucius Temple still stands majestically, recognized as the only ancient site in the East. Now that the National Government has designated August 27th as Confucius' birthday, the Qufu Confucius Temple is becoming increasingly popular among the people of the country. Recently, the highway between Yanzhou and Qufu has been completed, making transportation very convenient. The Jinpu Railway Bureau previously established the Qufu Hotel in Qufu, which was perfectly equipped. Later, the hotel was destroyed by war and has not yet been restored. Now that the highway from Yanzhou to Qufu has been built, the route from Yanzhou Station to Qufu City is faster than that from Qufu Station to Qufu City. Therefore, the Yanzhou Hotel has been established in Yanzhou to serve as a tour guide for Qufu. The hotel officially opened on the 15th of this month. On August 27th, the military, political, and academic circles of Shandong Province are preparing to hold a grand Confucius memorial ceremony. Therefore, some people in Shanghai have launched an organization (Qufu Tour Guide Team) to witness this grand ceremony. The Municipal Party Department is preparing to open</p>

<p>"Sheep City" Brand Products Welcomed Everywhere. The Chinese National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association launched the Northwest National Products Mobile Exhibition in May of this year, inviting major domestic product factories to join. Dalong Woolen Mill of this city sent personnel to carry the factory's "Sheep City" brand domestic woolen fabrics and serge to participate in the exhibition, passing through Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xi'an, and other places. Everywhere they went, they were welcomed. Recently, the delegation has moved to Lanzhou for the exhibition. However, due to transportation issues, each factory only entrusted the delegation to carry samples. Therefore, the personnel sent by the factory ended the exhibition in Xi'an and returned south, arriving in Shanghai yesterday. It is said that the results of this trip were very good. Shao Lizi, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, was very enthusiastic about promoting domestic products and praised the products of Dalong Factory, calling them the only woolen products in China and ordering all departments to adopt them uniformly. Therefore, the business in Xi'an was particularly good, and all the goods brought were sold out, which was unprecedented in previous exhibitions. The China Animal Protection Association Sends a Letter Requesting</p>
<h3 id="e192">All Temples to Set Up Shelters for Stray Dogs <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Following the Example of Raising Livestock to End Their Natural Lives. At the third meeting of the directors of the China Animal Protection Association, it was resolved that stray dogs should be arrested and strangled. It was requested that monasteries in all provinces and cities across the country should establish stray dog shelters, following the example of raising livestock, fish, and turtles. The original announcement is as follows (omitted above). I secretly believe that crises are lurking everywhere, robbery is imminent, the Divine Land is sinking, and the waiting is palpable. The teachings of Buddhism advocate equality for all beings, and their aspiration is vast, just as the Confucian pursuit of the ultimate good has the sentiment of being overly cautious. Therefore, this association adheres to these true principles and strives to put them into practice. It seeks to protect the safety of animals and eliminate the evil thoughts of human slaughter, which may avert crises and eliminate robbery.</p>
<p>Moreover, governments of various countries have enacted laws and regulations to protect animals, which are numerous. Even the ancient sages and worthies of our country, such as Tang of Shang opening the nets and Yiyin keeping away from the kitchen, were praised as the ultimate virtues by later generations. We should learn from Tang and Confucius and follow the example of the great powers. We should urgently provide a secure and positive guarantee for the lives and treatment of our helpless companions who coexist in the universe, so as not to fail in our heavenly duty of protecting life. For example, the dogs raised in various places are also one of our companions. How can we ignore their lives and treatment? Recently, municipal authorities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been concerned about rectifying the appearance of cities and the indiscriminate breeding of dogs. All ownerless stray dogs, regardless of whether they have rabies or other diseases, are arrested and subjected to cruel treatments such as strangulation or caustic injection. For example, Shen Bao reported on July 12 that Chairman Han of Jinan shot more than 2,000 stray dogs, which is shocking. This association has repeatedly tried to dissuade them, but they all claimed that there was nowhere to place them and that the words were empty. As the saying goes, preparation leads to success, and the fault lies in our failure to plan ahead. This association aims to implement its advocacy of animal protection, considering all aspects, and has thus made a motion to appeal to monasteries in various places to jointly provide relief. We humbly request all elders of the mountains to widely implement boundless benevolence and compassion, following the example of raising livestock, fish, and turtles, and to provide free separate feeding with surplus food so that innocent stray dogs can live out their natural lives and realize the fulfillment of equality for all beings. We previously drafted the method for raising stray dogs, and we are fortunate to have your understanding and generosity. It is truly magnificent.

<p>The Two Roads Bureau issued an order to the Transportation Department and the Police Department, stating: "The Ministry of Railways issued Order No. 10592, and the Ministry of Finance issued Letter No. 4579, which stated that in the future, if merchants privately transport tax-evading goods and the tax collection agency discovers and has concrete evidence and applies in advance for detention, the Railway Bureau should immediately instruct the station warehouse to notify the applying agency to send personnel to the station to witness the release of the goods when the merchant picks them up. However, the inspection of the goods should still be carried out outside the station. Please notify all roads to comply with this order, so as to avoid requesting to enter the station or board the train for inspection." In addition to distribution, this order also urgently instructs the department to comply with it.</p>

Lang Zuyin, the Chinese detective of the Laozha Police Station, and Bao Defu, the owner of the Longshun Gongdi Cargo Company on Fujian Road, were sued by Cai Yangqi of Chongming for using electric torture and false accusations in the First Special Court. Because Lang refused to appear in court, a dispute arose. Although the Ministry of Justice made representations to the police station in accordance with the law, it had no effect. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui of the Criminal Division held another hearing on this case. Lang Zuyin still did not appear in court. Judge Liu then announced that the case would be postponed to 2:00 PM on September 15th for another hearing. Store Clerk's Daring</p>

<p>Reckless and Absurd / Sentenced to Five Years and Ordered to Pay 100 Yuan in Compensation. Tang Xiyuan of Pudong used to run the Shunxing Printing House on Baoding Road, and his residence was at No. 63, Lane 580, Kang Nai Tuo Road, West Shanghai. Recently, due to business reasons, he moved the printing house to his residence to continue operating in order to save expenses. One morning, Tang went out on business, but Zhao Jiading, a 24-year-old clerk from Pudong, saw the housewife Tang Sunshi (29 years old, also from Pudong) sleeping alone in the room, with her chest exposed and snoring loudly. He was suddenly filled with lust and became daring. He immediately jumped onto the bed, first kissing her cheek and then removing her undergarments, committing rape. Tang Sunshi was awakened from her sleep, screamed for help, and was silenced by Zhao, who covered her mouth and forbade her from making any noise. Fearing that the matter would be exposed, he sneaked out of the room. Soon after, her husband returned home, and she told him what had happened. He reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station, and detectives Zhang Liang and Xitan Kaidi went to arrest Zhao Jiading and took him into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that he was prosecuting the defendant in accordance with Article 240, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law for the crime of rape. However, the defendant admitted to having sexual relations with Ju Sunshi while in the police station, but he said that they had known each other for a long time and had been having relations for more than 20 times. She had often provided him with money and clothes because he was poor. That morning, he asked her to borrow one silver dollar, which led to a dispute. Today, the victim Tang Sunshi, her husband Tang Xiyuan, and the witness Xue Fengshi have all arrived in court and request to be questioned. The court then announced that the hearing would be closed to the public due to the nature of the case. As a result, Judge Wu Yanqi announced in court that Zhao Jiading was found guilty of rape and sentenced to five years of imprisonment, and the defendant was ordered to pay damages to the victim.</p>

<p>Judge Wu first questioned the plaintiff Chen Wangshi, who stated that her original home was in Shangyu, Zhejiang, and she currently lives with her relative Wang Caisheng at No. 45 Daqing Lane, Nanjing Road. Today, I am accusing Xie Peide of murdering my daughter, and Hong Chengde and his concubine are accomplices. These three people kidnapped my daughter from Pushi Village on Pushi Road on April 26th, took her to Hong's house by car, and monitored her movements. On the afternoon of the 28th, my daughter tried to escape, but unfortunately, she was seen by a female servant of the Hong family, who reported it to her master. My daughter was dragged back that day and was murdered. All of this was told to me by the gatekeeper patrolman in early May, but the policeman did not specify who the murderer was. Although others also knew about it, no one dared to intervene because Xie was rich and powerful. Originally, when my daughter was 18 years old, she was a prostitute in Huile Lane. At the age of 19, she was married off to a man surnamed Pan and then</p>

<p>She met Liu Hongsheng, and through Liu, she met Xie. She lived with Xie for four years, and Xie never allowed my mother and daughter to meet. Suddenly, Xie married her daughter to Yang Binghu, which I did not know in advance. Xie had only met Yang Binghu once, so why did he marry my daughter to him? It was a vicious plot. I beg the court to redress the injustice. As the woman spoke, tears streamed down her face, and her voice was mournful. Judge Wu then said to her, "Hong Chengde and his concubine are not in Shanghai, and the summons cannot be delivered. Are you accusing those two people?" Chen Wangshi immediately said, "They (referring to Hong and his concubine) killed someone's daughter and ran away. They are truly shameless. Now that they are not in Shanghai, they will always have to return. Because Hong and his wife are accomplices, the charges cannot be withdrawn, and I must sue them." The court then questioned the defendant Xie Peide, who stated that his籍上處籍 current residence was No. 867 Kang Nai Tuo Road. The deceased Chen Zhujun had been with me for fourteen months. Until April 8th of this year, she began</p>
<h3 id="e200">Marrying Yang Binghu <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>I acted as the marriage witness. Yang and Chen divorced on the 24th of April. At 10:30 PM on the 26th, Chen came to my house and described her divorce from Yang. She also said she had difficulty making a living and begged for my assistance. I told her that due to my position, it was inconvenient for her to stay. Chen then decided to temporarily reside at the Hong’s house. I got Hong's consent by phone, and Hong and his concubine drove over. So, the four of us went out together. The car arrived at Hong's residence in the Sun Apartments on Weihaiwei Road. Hong, his concubine, and Chen got out of the car and went inside. I went to my office alone. On the morning of the 28th, at 1:00 AM, Yang Qiusun called my office and said that his grandson Binghu wanted to meet Chen at the Hong’s residence and asked him to go with him. Therefore, he asked me to accompany them to hear what the two of them were going to talk about. I couldn't refuse, so we agreed to meet at 7:00 PM that afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Meeting at the Hong Residence <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>At the appointed time, I went to wait for ten minutes. Mr. Yang and his grandson arrived, and Chen Zhujun also came to the living room. I saw that Binghu's face looked ashen, and I was quite worried. Binghu spoke first, saying, "I am very sorry for this matter." I immediately comforted him. After everyone had spoken, Binghu suddenly wanted to have a private talk with Chen. Chen refused again and again, but finally agreed to go into the bathroom with Binghu. After a moment, I faintly heard three or four thuds. Hong Chengde went to the bathroom to check and saw that both of them had died tragically. We then briefly looked around and reported to the police station, which sent Western Detective Watson to investigate. They found a handgun and a suicide note in the bathroom. The envelope said, "To be buried together." The letter was addressed to his grandfather. Later, the court examined the bodies. Because it had nothing to do with me, I did not go to the autopsy. Later, I heard that Chen Wangshi confessed at the time,</p>
<h3 id="e202">"I Was Killed" <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The court had to order me to appear in court. The next day, I immediately obeyed the summons and confessed everything. In court, the plaintiff Chen Wangshi was cross-examined, "If Xie really killed someone, why didn't you sue earlier?" The woman replied, "Because I had no money and was all alone, I had to ask friends and relatives for help, so I have been delayed until now." Then, He Yunpu, the detective from the Jing'an Police Station who handled the case, reported the situation of the investigation at the Hong's residence on the day he went with Western Detective Watson. He said that the bodies of the man and woman were lying in the bathroom, separated only by a chamber pot. The pistol and the letter were found at the entrance of the room. However, according to Xu Hongjun, the doorman there, on April 26, Mr. and Mrs. Hong, together with three other people, brought the deceased Chen Zhujun here and used those three people to monitor the woman's actions. On the 28th, the woman tried to escape but was stopped by the Hong family's maid. After Chen's death, she left behind twenty-three or four pieces of jewelry and a savings certificate for 1,000 yuan from a certain bank, all of which had been taken away by Xie. However, Xie flatly denied it. Judge Wu ordered that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned the hearing to Friday afternoon next week. Because of this, the court also ordered Zhao to compensate Tang Sunshi one hundred yuan in foreign currency. Murdering Zhang Soshi,</p>
<h3 id="e203">Chen Hengcai Was Executed by Hanging Yesterday <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Chen's last words were for his wife to remarry and leave the daughter. Before the execution, he sang Peking Opera loudly. Mr. Zhang, a former Qing dynasty county magistrate from Huzhou, had been dead for many years. He had two wives, both named Su, who lived at 762 Carter Road. The first wife gave birth to a daughter named Wenqing, who was of marriageable age but not yet married. Her mother suffered from paralysis, so all the inheritance was managed by the concubine, Su. Wenqing had disagreements with her stepmother. Instigated by others, on January 25, 1920, she incited Chen Hengcai, the son of the maid from Zhenjiang, who was now 29 years old, to collude with Gao Jintang and Yao Yonggui, who had already been arrested and sentenced to prison, to rob Zhang Soshi, stabbing her in vital areas and causing her death. After investigation by the Chinese and Western detectives of the Putuo Road Police Station, Zhang Wenqing and Chen Hengcai were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court. As a result, Chen was sentenced to death, and Zhang was sentenced to life imprisonment. Chen was approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and ordered to be executed. Yesterday morning, the police took Chen from the prison and sent him to the Third Criminal Court for execution. Judge Shen Shanzeng asked him if he had any last words or letters to his family. Chen was short in stature and calm in demeanor. He said that he had a wife and a daughter at home. If his wife wanted to remarry, he asked his sisters to keep the daughter. The rest of his words were hesitant. The court ordered the Chinese and Western police to take him down, and he suddenly sang Peking Opera loudly. Then, together with the entire case file and photographs, he was escorted by car to the Second Prison execution ground in Caohejing. According to the law, he was hanged for his crime. The Shanghai Local Court sent prosecutors to verify his identity, ordered the police to tie him up according to the law, and carried out the hanging. The body was exposed overnight and buried in a coffin the next morning. The slaughter cattle company</p>
<h3 id="e204">Two Gangs of Butchers Fought <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The gangs from Pudong and Jiangyin have a deep-seated feud. The slaughterhouse company established by the French Municipal Council on Min Ti Ni Yin Road in the French Concession, commonly known as the half-slaughter company, employs butchers and workers who are divided into gangs from Pudong and Jiangyin, each with its own leaders. However, due to their duties, the workers from the two gangs have repeatedly had undercurrents and disputes. On the 26th of last month, butchers from the Pudong gang went to Nanjing to buy live pigs and had a fight with the Jiangyin gang, injuring three butchers from the Pudong gang. The case was reported to the Public Security Bureau, which arrested two members of the Jiangyin gang, who were transferred to the Local Court for trial and sentenced to a fine of 40 yuan each. Seven fleeing suspects were also ordered to be arrested. Because of this, the workers from the two gangs harbored even deeper resentment and constantly thought of revenge. Recently, the situation became urgent. The Chinese and Western directors of the slaughterhouse company, fearing a major disaster, went to the Songshan Road Police Station on the 16th to report the incident and request the dispatch of detectives to protect the area around the company to ensure safety. Unexpectedly, at 11:30 PM that evening, a group of butchers from the Jiangyin gang entered the company from Glock Road to start their slaughtering work. When they arrived near Wenyuanfang at the north end of the company's back door, they were suddenly attacked by a group of butchers from the Pudong gang who rushed out of Wenyuanfang Lane, blocking the Jiangyin gang from entering the company. During the argument, a fight broke out. The Pudong gang butchers, each armed with knives and axes, wildly stabbed and slashed at the Jiangyin gang butchers. At that time, Xu Zhongqiu (23 years old), Xu Mingde (22 years old), Jiang Fuda (23 years old), and Ren Jinbao (23 years old), all from the Jiangyin gang living at No. 11 Wenyuanfang, and Yao Shengxiang (28 years old), from the Jiangyin gang living at No. 5 Bao'anfang, were injured by axes and knives, bleeding profusely. For a time, the noise was deafening, and the sirens of the police cars sounded, as if facing a major enemy. Chinese police officers from No. 505 and No. 621 arrived and arrested Qin Haichang (also known as A Xiang, 23 years old, from Jiading), Gao Shanyun (26 years old, from Chuansha), and Wang Ren'er (24 years old, from Haimen), three members of the Pudong gang living at No. 9 Huabao Fang on Lagenna Road, and took them to the police station. At the same time, the injured were sent to Guangci Hospital. After examination by doctors, Xu Zhongqiu had a head wound, and Xu Mingde and Yao Shengxiang were stabbed in the buttocks. Since the injuries were minor, they were bandaged and discharged from the hospital to return home. Jiang Fuda and Ren Jinbao were cut several times by knives and axes and were more seriously injured and hospitalized for treatment. At noon yesterday, the police sent the defendants to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo interrogated them. Yuan Jiahan, the police lawyer, stated the case, saying that the defendants were detained for crimes such as assault and restriction of freedom, and the police needed to conduct a detailed investigation and requested a postponement. The defendants were temporarily detained pending further investigation. Then, the victims Xu Zhongqiu, Xu Mingde, and Yao Shengxiang testified that when they were going to work at the company, the defendants and dozens of others came out to stop them, not allowing them to enter the company. Their boss, Chen Jinhai, held a gun to intimidate them and ordered the defendants to commit violence, resulting in them being injured by knives and axes. They requested an investigation. When questioned, the defendants denied committing the violence and hired lawyer Wang Shizong to defend them. The court ordered the hearing to be adjourned to the 22nd and the defendants were returned to custody. The victims were ordered to submit to a medical examination at the forensic office to verify their injuries. A tragic event in the world.</p>

<p>Fu Yuechun, how pitiful! Drowned on the day of his engagement. Fu Yuechun, a Ningbo native residing at No. 6 Xinlong Lane, Xianji Road, Nanshi, was only 20 years old. He was a deputy steward on the Taikoo Company's Ninghai ship. He had just resigned a week ago and was unemployed at home. His father was a deputy steward on the company's Daming ship. Yesterday was the date of Yuechun's engagement. The Ninghai ship had arrived in port the day before, so his father came home yesterday to help take care of things and distribute large amounts of fruit and steamed buns to relatives and friends according to Ningbo customs. He instructed Yuechun to handle the ship's affairs for one day. At 3:45 PM, Yuechun bought some Western pastries from Puxi and took the Taikoo express ferry back to the ship at the Yangjingbang Wharf. When the ferry arrived at the Huatong Wharf in Pudong, Yuechun, eager to disembark, accidentally slipped from the wharf and fell into the river, immediately sinking without a trace. He tragically drowned. When colleagues on the ship learned of this, they sent a message to Yuechun's home. Just as relatives and friends were gathered together, warmly celebrating, they suddenly heard the bad news. It was like a bolt from the blue, and the whole family was inconsolable. The family reported the news to the bride's family and asked a friend to report to the Customs Water Police Station to request the retrieval of the body. Chinese Detective Gu Wenkui investigated the scene and hired people to search for the body. By evening, the body had not been found. It was truly tragic.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Petitioned to Party and Government Again Yesterday <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Opposing the Factory's Dismissal of Workers. The Huatong Electric Manufacturing Factory on Zhoujiazui Road, Hongkou employs more than 500 workers. Recently, because the factory workers joined the Fourth District Electrical Industry Union, it attracted the attention of the factory. The factory suddenly announced on the previous day (10th) that there was a shortage of raw materials and dismissed more than 200 workers in the electric fan department. The workers were panicked and negotiated with Manager Yao of the factory, requesting to continue working in order to maintain their livelihoods. Unexpectedly, the factory ignored them and reported to the police station, which sent a large number of detectives to drive the workers out of the factory and close the doors. The workers felt that the factory was unreasonable and petitioned the party and government agencies and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, requesting assistance to resume work as soon as possible. Later, the Social Bureau approved that the factory should allow workers from other departments to enter the factory to work, and workers from the electric fan department should wait for mediation. The factory workers, after being persuaded by the Municipal Party Department and the Federation of Trade Unions, also expressed their acceptance. They obeyed the order and entered the factory to work on the previous day. Unexpectedly, the factory again dismissed eight workers from other departments on the pretext of dismissal. The workers became even more panicked. Yesterday morning, they immediately sent representatives to report to the superior authorities and requested that personnel be sent to negotiate to avoid escalating the dispute. Chen Liangping, a representative of the Social Bureau, and Gong Yuting, a representative of the Federation of Trade Unions, met with the manager of the factory and tried their best to mediate, but the factory's attitude was firm, and there was no result.</p>

<p>Teng Tao Swallows Opium and Kills Herself: Teng Tao, an Anhui woman, was forty-seven years old. Her husband, Teng Wenyu, both worked in the Shenxin No. 7 Cotton Mill on Jinsheng Road. They lived in the factory's dormitory. Teng had a younger brother who lived in their hometown, working as a farmer. He had four children. Recently, due to poor farming conditions and a difficult life, he intended to send two of his sons to Shanghai to ask his brother to take care of them, hoping to make a living. He immediately wrote a letter to his brother, detailing the hardships in the countryside and requesting his consent. After receiving the letter, Teng, out of brotherly affection, felt obliged to help and immediately replied, agreeing to the request. However, the matter was discovered by his wife the day before yesterday. Because she did not get along well with her uncle, she argued with her husband upon hearing about it. It was too late to change anything, and she was extremely frustrated. She suddenly had the thought of ending her life and secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. When Teng discovered her, she was groaning in bed. He rushed her to Tongren Hospital, and then transferred her to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died around 4 PM that day. The hospital reported it to the Yulin Road Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to the autopsy room on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Local Court, was dispatched to the scene to examine the body. After questioning Teng Wenyu, the deceased's husband, who recounted the previous events, Prosecutor Guo declared that the deceased, Teng Tao, a female, had indeed died from opium poisoning. The body was released to her husband, Teng Wenyu, to arrange for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e229">The Chicken and Egg Problem <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>– Reply to Mr. Wang Zaifu – The question of whether the chicken or the egg came first is not limited to chickens; it is a question of the origin of all living things. The real essence of this question is: were all living things initially already living things, or were they initially only in egg form? To solve this problem, knowledge of biology is essential, and a correct way of thinking is also necessary. If we only have scattered scientific knowledge without a correct method to systematize it, we will still not be able to understand this problem consistently. In the past scientific community, there were two solutions to the problem of the origin of life. The first is the so-called spontaneous generation theory, which believes that all living things arise spontaneously from non-living matter. According to this theory, the chicken was initially a chicken and did not necessarily come from an egg, just as rice turns into mice and rotten grass turns into fireflies. This theory was refuted in the second half of the nineteenth century by the German microbiologist Pasteur. Last year, Dr. Luo Guangting of China claimed to have confirmed this theory again, but scholars across the country exposed his absurdity. Now we all know that this theory is untenable. The second theory is that life absolutely cannot arise spontaneously. The reason there is life on Earth is that there were originally seeds of life in the universe, and these seeds were brought to Earth by fragments of celestial bodies such as meteorites and gradually developed into their current form. According to this theory, life was initially in the form of (eggs), and only when it encountered a suitable environment on Earth did it hatch into living things. This theory does not completely solve the problem. It assumes that life originates from seeds, but if we ask how the seeds were formed, there is no way to answer. Because this theory is completely opposed to the theory of spontaneous generation, it does not admit that seeds can arise from non-living matter. If they did not arise from non-living matter, then where did they come from? In the end, it seems we can only use God's creation to explain it, leading us into the realm of religious souls! Currently, we all know that living things are constantly evolving. During the process of evolution, the structure of living things changes from simple to complex, from lower to higher. In other words, the more ancient the living things, the simpler their body structure. Thirty million years ago, the world only had large reptiles, which were much lower in the scale of evolution than modern humans, cattle, horses, tigers, and leopards. However, tens of millions of years before that thirty million years ago, there was an era when there were not even reptiles. At that time, there were only simple animals such as coelenterates and shellfish. However, these simple animals were still much more complex than the even more ancient creatures. The more ancient and simpler creatures were single-celled organisms. No matter how simple coelenterates and the like are, they are always composed of tens of thousands of cells. A single-celled organism can form an independent organism with just one cell. Many species of these single-celled organisms still remain today, continuing their humble lives in the microscopic world. The theory of evolution has obtained definitive and irrefutable evidence from paleontology, serology, comparative anatomy, and other aspects. Now, no one can overturn it anymore. We are now certain that the various races of living things do not arise spontaneously from non-living matter, but develop and differentiate along a long evolutionary journey. If races could be directly produced from non-living matter, it would fundamentally shake the laws of evolution. Since we cannot deny the laws of evolution, the Luo-style theory of spontaneous generation, such as rice turning into mice, cannot stand. But at the same time, because we believe that the most ancient living things are the simplest single-celled organisms, we cannot deny that at some point in the distant past, the living things of that time must have been so simple that they were almost indistinguishable from non-living matter. Furthermore, we can even assume that in a certain primitive period, non-living matter formed the first living things through certain chemical and physical actions. These living things were the beginning of all later living things, a small life so simple that it was almost indistinguishable from non-living matter. This is also a kind of spontaneous generation theory, but this spontaneous generation theory is absolutely different from the theory of rice turning into mice and has a scientific basis in evolutionary theory. This spontaneous generation theory is precisely the conclusion that the theory of evolution must inevitably reach. According to the results of today's scientific research, the form of the first living things that we can assume must still be the form of single-celled organisms, but the first single-celled organisms must have been much simpler than the single-celled organisms that remain today. If we say that the form of a single cell is the form of an egg, and that all living things in the world evolved from single-celled organisms, then we can immediately reach the conclusion that it was (the egg that came before the chicken, not the chicken before the egg). But things cannot be said so simply. We must pay attention to the fact that the chicken is a multicellular animal, and the reproductive life of multicellular organisms is different from that of single cells. The hundreds of millions of cells that make up the entire body of the chicken will eventually die along with the chicken itself, so it must use the method of laying eggs to maintain the existence of the race. But for single-celled organisms, they can not only survive on their own but also reproduce by dividing themselves. Therefore, in single-celled organisms, there is no distinction between (chicken) and (egg). The single cell itself is the chicken and also the egg. The two opposing functions of (chicken) and (egg) are fused together in single-celled organisms, a hidden contradiction, a potential action. At this time, we simply cannot ask whether the egg came before the chicken or the chicken before the egg. We can also say that the egg came before the egg, or the chicken came before the chicken. Because you cannot strictly say whether a single-celled animal itself is an egg or a chicken. Therefore, the question of whether the chicken or the egg came first can only arise after there is a chicken. In other words, this question only has meaning for multicellular animals. The phenomenon of laying eggs and eggs hatching from eggs is a unique phenomenon in multicellular organisms. If there were no multicellular organisms in living things, there would never be such a phenomenon. Thus, we know that the establishment of multicellular organisms is a prerequisite for this phenomenon, which also means that the establishment of the chicken itself is a prerequisite for laying eggs. Based on this point, we should regard the chicken as the foundation and say that the chicken came before the egg, not the egg before the chicken. From the example of biological evolution, the simplest multicellular organisms do not use the phenomenon of producing seeds to carry out their reproductive functions. The daughter bodies of Volvox separate directly from the mother body, and coelenterates such as Hydra reproduce by budding. This tells us that in the process of biological evolution, when multicellular organisms were first formed, they did not immediately have the phenomenon of producing seeds. The phenomenon of producing seeds only appeared when multicellular organisms had developed to a more complex and advanced state. At such times, the opposing functions of the chicken and the egg differentiated from a latent state to a manifest state, and the cycle of chicken laying egg and egg hatching chicken began. In this way, we can conclude that in the beginning, the egg was laid by the chicken. Afterwards, the chicken and the egg infinitely cycle each other as cause and effect. We acknowledge the cyclical action and mutual interaction. But we also need to find the ultimate starting point in the cycle and the fundamental guiding role in the interaction. Otherwise, we will become eclecticists.</p>

<p>— Bo</p>
<p>Some say that the evolution of the times is a straight line, others say it is like ripples, and still others have determined that it is a cycle based on the fact that the size of cuffs gets bigger and smaller, and then smaller and bigger. These are all profound theories, but the people who say these things have forgotten one thing: they have forgotten that the times are determined by human beings. They think that this is something that concerns another planet, but they do not know that it concerns themselves and their kind.</p>
<p>How do you decide the times? If you are sitting in a study reciting poetry or listening to cicadas chirping in the shade of a tree, the further you are from society, the less impact you have. However, when you step onto the political stage, or have a large deposit in the bank, or have the talent of a silver tongue, you vaguely feel that you have the power to manipulate the times. At that time, you will say (bullshit, bullshit, this is really outrageous)!</p>
<p>But what if you have a feeling? You must have ideals, you must have management skills, you must have actions, and you must have effects. Then, are the times affected? Here is a very simple example that can prove it:</p>
<p>In public amusement places, there is often a small cage, and in the cage there is often a pair of wire balls, like the meridians on a geography textbook, in which several white mice are kept, stepping on this cage day and night, going up! Forward! - But the distance does not decrease, and this kind of management is quite painstaking. The distance traveled in a day should be several miles. This has become one of the entertainments for the audience, interesting!</p>
<p>Suppose we think for the mice, instead of driving a car in a cage, run out and run around. At least the distance can be different, right? The outside is not as comfortable as in the cage, but it is also surrounded by narrowness and is not ridiculed by the audience. Where do you want to run so hard? To make people happy forever?</p>
<p>It is really what they say (the wisdom and foolishness of people are like mouse droppings)! The same amount of power is used, but the results are very different; everyone has the power to decide the times, as long as they break the surrounding cage.</p>
<h3 id="e231">(Literature Dies, Disaster Won’t Stop) <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>– Huang Pingling</p>
<p>In a letter to the mass language expert Cao Juren, Mr. Wu Zhihui expressed his extreme aversion to literature in the Free Talk section of Shen Bao. He wrote down two famous words of hatred: (Literature dies, disaster won’t stop.) We are not surprised that Mr. Wu wrote these two angry words, because Mr. Wu has always been dedicated to promoting science and engineering.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Wu was not the first to advocate science and engineering. From Zhang Zhidong's advocacy of Western learning for application and Chinese learning as the foundation, to the era of Westernization self-strengthening theory in the late Qing Dynasty, to the heyday of vocational education in the fifth and sixth years of the Republic of China, to the current era of focusing on science and engineering, it can be seen that China has been promoting science and technology and advocating craftsmanship at all times. The Chinese students who were sent to study abroad as early as the Daoguang era, which is now sixty years ago. Among them, about seven-tenths of the students sent abroad studied science and engineering, and three-tenths studied military affairs. As for the country officially sending young people to study literature abroad, there has simply never been such a thing (except for those who pay their own expenses). It can be said that literature has never been promoted in China.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu suspects that China's science and engineering are inferior to others because of the large number of people studying literature. In fact, this is not the case at all. According to our experience in running literary and artistic publications for six or seven years, we feel that at this moment, we cannot find even a dozen people in the country who can write decent works. There are only two or three literary and artistic publications in the country that are relatively decent. Almost everyone feels the lack of creation in these two or three publications. Recently, none of the three or two film companies in China are not short of scripts. If things continue like this, Chinese literature will definitely die; however, after literature dies, whether the disaster can be stopped is the responsibility of those who study science and engineering.</p>
<p>Science and engineering has been promoted for sixty years, and the country has spent no less than tens of millions of trillions of gold pounds on tuition fees. Now, our daily necessities, in addition to the application of imported goods, are only devolved to the stone age of barrenness. Whose fault is it? China, which has been known as an agricultural country for four thousand years, still uses the old tricks invented by our ancestors. Whose fault is it? Those who study commerce, those who study engineering, those who study architecture... are abundant in China, but to this day, they cannot imitate an electric light bulb or make a screw by themselves. No matter how big or small the civil engineering projects are, they all rely on foreigners to be our consultants. Whose fault is it?</p>
<p>(Literature) cannot be used as clothing in the cold, nor can it be used as food when hungry. It is indeed useless waste. However, everyone attributes the brilliant achievements of European and American science and culture today to the Renaissance of the seventeenth century. I don't know why. Even the militarist Hitler could not help but respect the old writer Hauptmann as much as possible and spend huge sums of money to build Wagner's music memorial hall and hold a grand centenary memorial for Goethe. I don't know why. The heroic Mussolini treated the intellectuals in the country with great courtesy, especially the literary writer D'Annunzio. I don't know why. France held a state funeral only five times, and the literary artists Hugo and France occupied two of them. I don't know why. Recently, those in power in Soviet Russia are mostly from the literary world, but it does not hinder their five-year plan. It is a fact; the literary atmosphere in Japan is already so strong, and the Ministry of Education still assists the progress of literature and art. The University of Tokyo has not abolished the Department of Literature, which is also a fact. No one in China has openly promoted literary and artistic movements, and the country has never sacrificed a tuition fee for literature. The government has never had any plans for literary and artistic facilities. It is only with the interest of a very few people that they occasionally make minimal contributions to literature, and they cannot avoid being cursed so viciously by Mr. Wu Zhihui. It is so pitiful.</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Wu is eagerly looking forward to China's road to revival, but if there are no literary and artistic figures working diligently to improve the people's will to move upward, change the people's increasingly declining morbidity, and invigorate the nation's great spirit, I am afraid that although there are many people studying science and engineering, and there are many people promoting science and engineering, it always feels a little difficult to make the country receive the practical effects of science and engineering! Because although they are studying science and engineering, they are still holding on to the old idea of (studying well and then becoming an official). No such fool will really run to the scientific and engineering fields.</p>
<h3 id="e232">The Problem of (Showing the Goods) <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Fulan</p>
<p>The discussion of the mass language problem has been going on until now, and some people still think that mass language literature is a brand new, sensational thing, which is really not right. For example, Mr. So-and-so's article (Try it out) has this meaning.</p>
<p>Establishing mass language literature does not completely (negate) vernacular Chinese and (create) a new mass language writing with three heads and six arms. It is precisely to remove the harmful elements from vernacular Chinese - the mixed classical Chinese, Europeanized tone, and everything that does not suit the needs of the masses. Although mass language writing is different from vernacular Chinese, it does not completely negate the vernacular Chinese since the May Fourth Movement and come up with a completely (new) writing. We know that the growth and reform of language and writing are slow, and there must be a process of reform and change in it. A completely new mass language writing cannot (suddenly) be produced. If it can, it is not mass language writing, but (heavenly scripture)!</p>
<p>Many people have this (high-profile) tendency, and then two questions arise: (Show the goods) and (What form should mass language writing take).</p>
<p>Mr. So-and-so also said: (Take out the mass language works, take out the model of mass language writing) (The word 'model' can be replaced by the word '樣式'). This attitude of urgently wanting people to take out the goods is not very reasonable. Mass language literature is not (red bean shaved ice). You only need to shave the ice, add red bean soup, and you can immediately send it to your mouth. The promotion of mass language writing is to make people first aware of this need, and then gradually reform and complete it in this direction - apply the new popular spoken language of the masses, remove the mixed classical Chinese and Europeanized tone, and grow together in the development of the public's life. The goods are there, but they are not like red bean shaved ice that can immediately quench your thirst. If you want to see the goods and bargain now, then you can only laugh like a mass language work (made) by someone. It can be said that this has not touched the establishment of the mass language literature problem itself!</p>
<p>Because of the urgent need for (goods), some people advocate the implementation of local dialects under the question of (what form should mass language literature take). Therefore, they advocate writing in local dialects, thinking that it is a mass language literature good. This is a consistent mistake. I once published two articles on the opinions of local dialects in the supplement of Hua Ri Bao. My meaning is that it is not bad to use local dialects naturally. If you take local dialects as an important factor of mass language, forcibly use them together, or completely write in local dialects, it is impossible in any case. There are many people who have raised this issue for discussion, both in favor and against. However, I still firmly advocate that pure local dialects are not important for the establishment of mass language writing, and I think that those who propose pure local dialect literature are somewhat making the mistake of being eager to show the goods to others.</p>
<h3 id="e233">One Year of Unemployment <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>Since leaving school last summer vacation, the issue of finding a way out has been bothering me. I asked friends and relatives to write letters of introduction and ran around looking for opportunities, but I was completely disappointed. I had no money to dream of going abroad with friends, and I couldn't find a position. In fact, I didn't have too many extravagant hopes. I would be willing to take even a small clerk's position, but even such a wish could not be fulfilled, so I started to live as a recluse in my hometown.</p>
<p>The seasons quickly turned around. After the scorching summer, there was a windy and rainy autumn; watching the snowflakes fly in front of the court, after the New Year, it was the good weather of the new spring. I watched the peach blossoms bloom and fall in loneliness, and the rich spring also slowly stepped through the world. In the blink of an eye, it was another hot day. Now it is the time of year when I lost my job last year! But I am still stuck in my hometown, unable to find a place to eat, staring at the sunlight in front of the window, moving down the wall in the morning and quietly moving back in the evening, living day by day, and the poor life is pressing down on me, as if there is nothing to say—</p>
<p>—Unemployment has been a year!</p>
<p>Staring at the calendar on the wall that has been torn off for most of the year, I sighed so much.</p>
<p>My unemployment was actually expected. Living in today's era, especially in this year of social depression, it is very appropriate and inevitable that someone like me is listed among the unemployed. The worldwide economic depression has certainly affected the livelihood of an unknown small person; on the one hand, my own excessive uselessness cannot cater to a rogue-style society. I am always foolishly trying to retain a little honesty in being a human being, so I am more likely to be frustrated and fail.</p>
<p>In the vast world, I can't find a place to eat, and I am stuck in a narrow cage-like hometown, like a parasite, sucking the dried-up intestinal walls of my grandmother and father, who have no fat. A wounded heart is gradually sinking towards dusk and will form a hysterical patient.</p>
<p>It's the time of year when the summer is over and the autumn is beginning again. Unemployment has been a year!</p>
<p>Last year, today, I was wandering on the street. This year, I am still wandering in the same way. A wounded heart is screaming:</p>
<p>—I want to live—!</p>

<p>— Pu Feng</p>
<p>No matter where you go, to Singapore, Java, or Hong Kong, it is most common to see Western women walking down the street with a dog in their hands; even in Shanghai, we can easily get proof.</p>
<p>Why are dogs so especially loved by women?</p>
<p>They can guard the door, they specialize in bullying beggars dressed in rags, and they are loyal to their masters. This is what we know about dogs. However, now, the Pekingese dogs being held in their hands are not used for guarding the door, but rather for being loyal to their masters, playing with them day and night. In a word, they are just a kind of toy for the master.</p>
<p>If women need toys, just as children need candy, dogs, this thing obviously has enough qualifications to be loved by women!</p>
<p>When you walk on Avenue Joffre, whether you see dogs being held by Western women or see them being carried in cars, and noble women are caressing them tenderly, you don't need to envy them. The problem is that they are indeed a kind of toy. - Unemployment, hunger, and cold should make us angry that they feed beef to dogs every day and feel ashamed to be human. Are you still drooling over them?</p>
<p>Naturally, they have truly become a kind of toy. If God is always speaking fairly for the rich, then dogs, they should enjoy happiness. Dogs, precisely because they are being raised, feel happy, and they are proudly thinking that this happiness will continue endlessly!</p>
<p>But can you say that Pekingese dogs are the only ones being held in women's arms and held in women's hands? I believe that without a prophet to testify for us, many men are being raised like Pekingese dogs; similarly, their dreams will never wake up!</p>

<p>But now, he thought, shaking his head.</p>
<p>It was not early, and the shop opposite had been closed for half an hour. He had no choice but to stand up and walk forward two steps, staggering, but suddenly, someone broke in.</p>
<p>(Who is it?) he thought in his heart. His eyes were really a little blurry. If it was just because he was old, his strength was a little useless. That's not the whole story; it was more because he drank a little more wine that he couldn't see anything clearly.</p>
<p>He wiped his eyes with his palm, and the person who came in shouted in a loud voice:</p>
<p>(You're really old, old man, can't you recognize me?)</p>
<p>(Followed by a burst of rude laughter, the person's face moved closer to him.)</p>
<p>He could see some of it now. It was a face like a large, fat pumpkin, with a beard that connected to his sideburns and hair, but his nose was like a hanging red pepper. He remembered, he called out:</p>
<p>(Alise, is that you? You haven't been here for a month.)</p>
<p>He was happy, as if he had drunk more wine, and spoke in a short voice, deliberately shaking his hand and patting the person's shoulder.</p>
<p>(Wasn't I here two weeks ago? Your memory is really a little bad.)</p>
<p>(The memory isn't bad, it must be————) he said, paused, shaking his head, (it must be because I drank a little more wine.)</p>
<p>After saying that, he raised his eyelids to look at the person, but the person was staring at the fancy hat he had bought years ago, paying no attention to his words at all.</p>
<p>He deliberately tilted his body and bumped into the person, repeating the sentence:</p>
<p>(Yesterday, I drank a little more wine!)</p>
<p>(Ah, old man, no wonder you're so drunk. It would be a little troublesome if you fell down!)</p>

<p>Severe Drought in Zhejiang</p>
<h3 id="e237">Sharp Decline in New Student Enrollment at Various Schools <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, our country's rural economy has collapsed, financial instability has caused panic, and this year we have suffered another drought, greatly affecting the autumn harvest. In the past, even families with a hundred acres of land could barely afford the expenses of a middle school student. It is now known that the summer vacation for all levels of schools in Zhejiang Province is about to end. For the 23rd academic year, the enrollment of new students has been completed in some schools, and those that have not yet been held will begin their entrance exams in the next few days. Taking Hangzhou City as an example, the number of applicants for the entrance examinations for junior high schools and above has decreased unprecedentedly this year, especially in private middle schools with shorter histories and higher tuition fees. Even schools like the Provincial Hangzhou High School, Provincial Hangzhou Junior High School, Municipal Middle School, and Hangzhou Normal School, which used to attract around a thousand applicants each year, have seen a sharp decline of four to five hundred applicants, despite the Education Department's efforts to implement scholarships, grants, and reduced meal fees for normal school students in these difficult times to help impoverished students. However, the National Zhejiang University has seen an increase in applicants due to its lower tuition fees. As for the Central Aviation School in Jianqiao, Hangzhou, which offers tuition and board free of charge, the number of applicants has increased even more. This clearly shows that the social and economic panic has reached an extreme. Northeastern Youth.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Recent News from the Relief and Education Office <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>▲Funding for Student Relief is Being Distributed: Several recent news items from the Northeastern Youth Education Relief Office of the Ministry of Education are excerpted below: (1) The relief fund for Northeastern students, recently amounting to 40,000 yuan, has been received by the Relief Office and is now being remitted to various schools in provinces and cities that have Northeastern youths to be forwarded to the students. (Currently, Northeastern students are present in more than a dozen provinces and cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Shandong, and others, with the most students in Beijing and Tianjin.) Approximately 4,000 Northeastern students in various provinces and cities have requested assistance, and after investigation and verification, over 3,000 have been deemed eligible. The subsidy methods are as follows: For university students, the general expense (meal fee) is 4 yuan per person per month, and the special expense (for books, etc., only for excellent students) is 5 yuan per person per month, calculated over five months per semester. Excellent students can receive 45 yuan in both general and special expenses per semester, while ordinary students receive only the general expense of 20 yuan per semester. For high school students, the general (meal fee) expense is 3.5 yuan per person per month, and the special expense (for books, etc.) is 4 yuan. Excellent students can receive 37.5 yuan in both general and special expenses per semester. For junior high school students, the general expense is 3.5 yuan per person, and the special expense is 3 yuan. Excellent students can receive 32.5 yuan per semester. The subsidy for primary school students is only 3 yuan per semester for tuition fees. (2) Zhongshan Middle School in North China was established with high school, junior high school, junior vocational, and supplementary classes, with a total of 800 students. This term, after the summer vacation, the school is enrolling (applications are currently being accepted, and the examination will be held in the twenties of this month) senior vocational students and high school students in the third grade, as well as junior high school students and students for supplementary classes, totaling about 200 students. In addition, 200 students from the privately run Zhixing Middle School (which specializes in accepting Northeastern students and recently merged into Zhongshan Middle School) will also be added. After the summer vacation, Zhongshan Middle School will have 1,200 students. (3) The Relief Office plans to hold examinations for Northeastern students to study abroad in the early part of this month after the spring and autumn seasons.</p>

With the summer vacation ending, the school authorities are preparing the classrooms, arranging the curriculum, and will open on the 20th of this month. In addition to all the original students continuing to enroll, the number of new students applying recently has been increasingly enthusiastic, and there are few vacancies left. In addition to the elementary school, the school also has a kindergarten. The director and teachers of the kindergarten are all graduates of famous kindergarten normal schools and have a wealth of knowledge and experience in early childhood education and care. The facilities are complete, with toys, models, hanging pictures, sports equipment, etc. Therefore, there are only six vacancies in the kindergarten. It is also heard that the graduates of this school have all been admitted to Wuben Zhengshi and other middle schools for further study. ▲Jinglin Night School: Jinglin Night School, located on Kunshan Road, Hongkou, offers courses in Chinese, English, mathematics, shorthand, typing, and Japanese.

In addition to reducing tuition and fees across the board, the school has also established an after-school tutoring class to make up for the uneven academic levels of students applying to private schools. This after-school tutoring class does not charge any fees, is open year-round, and does not close for summer vacation. Classes are held for two hours each day from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM, with Chinese, English, and mathematics as the main subjects. The aim is to enable students with insufficient levels to make up for their shortcomings through diligence and to be able to write fluent and coherent Chinese and speak fluent English in the shortest possible time.

<h3 id="e255">Children's Health Camp (II) <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Shangxian ▲Social Activity Education: Hosted by me. During this summer vacation, I spent almost all my time living in the camp, carefully planning activities. There were also two guidance directors, Tu Yunqin and Huang Qionghe, and nine counselors, Chen Caiying, Li Jiefang, Zhang Dede, Ma Ji, Luo Meixue, Xu Zhengyi, Yang Shuqing, He Yirong, and Lu Muwen, who were jointly responsible. In addition to their classes, they diligently guided the children in all aspects of their lives, including eating, sleeping, and bathing. Social activities were also managed by them. Lonely children gradually became familiar with their roommates and then expanded to a wider range. Outdoor walks, chats on the grass, (story time) after dinner, sports, gatherings, and trips all provided opportunities to practice socializing. I heard that many children cried when they first entered the camp because they were away from home, and one mother even cried after leaving her son. Now, this is no longer a problem, and they even prefer to stay in the camp. The child of that crying mother even sent a letter to comfort her. We know that most neurotic patients suffer from improper socialization, such as being ridiculed or scolded in front of others, liking this person and hating that person, or being intimidated, which can lead to future tragedies. A recent statistical report from the Ministry of Health stated that the number of people in our country who die from suicide and other abnormal causes reaches 6 million each year, with an estimated economic loss of 300 million yuan. Therefore, psychological hygiene in social interaction is particularly important in the camp. ▲Nutritional Attention: What we eat has a great impact on health and development. Since McColum woke people up, modern people have paid attention to experimental reports, which have been endless. For example, the difference between rats that eat milk and those that do not is extremely large. Those that eat milk develop quickly, have strong resistance, have a longer lifespan, and a lower mortality rate. After several generations, their physique is strong. Conversely, those that do not eat milk are not doing well. Now, our children are mostly thin and weak, short and feeble. Urban children eat too much meat, and rural children eat too many vegetables, neither of which is appropriate. Some children do not eat this or that, which also goes against nutritional principles. The health camp stipulates five meals a day. At 7:00 AM, there is porridge, noodles, or buttered bread, porridge and dishes, and rice and dishes are similar, avoiding salty things. At 10:00 AM, soy milk is given. Our country's soy milk is as nourishing as milk, cheap and beautiful. Schools and families should make children drink it often. At 12:00 PM, there is lunch. The menu changes daily, with a balanced mix of meat and vegetables. The main items are eggs, chicken, meat, fish, liver, blood, tofu, and green vegetables. At 4:00 PM, half a pound of milk is drunk, which Westerners call After School bile, which is also very important. At 7:00 PM, there is dinner, accompanied by mung bean porridge, red bean soup, noodles, and other items. After both lunch and dinner, various fruits such as oranges, apples, bananas, and hawthorns are served. The skins of hawthorns and other fruits are covered with bacteria, so they are washed and disinfected with one ten-thousandth (Potasu pcrmanganas) and cold boiled water. This kind of medicine costs about three or four cents a pound, and drugstores in Chengdu sell it. Schools and families can keep it on hand. Things grown on the ground have the most insects and bacteria. It is extremely dangerous to eat them without disinfection, and it seems that this can no longer be ignored. Watermelon is a heat-relieving food, and it is eaten several times a week. Children often reject cod liver oil. Dr. Wu Liguo of the Health Bureau used orange juice, lime, and malt extract to specially make a kind of liver oil for this camp. The results of the experiment were excellent. All the children in the camp accepted and swallowed it (color). After the camp is over, if they can continue to take it, the effect will be obvious. Their dining hall is simple and clean, with green oilcloth on the tables, two sets of sanitary spoons and chopsticks, and a plate. The red table indicates that you can take vegetables from the vegetable bowl to the rice bowl or plate. The blue table clearly indicates that private items can only be sent into the mouth. This sanitary usage prevents saliva from entering the vegetable bowl and prevents the spread of uncleanliness. The radio is turned on during meals to be fast and energetic. ▲Exercise Encouragement: Specially emphasizing eating and neglecting exercise is also not a way to health. Eating well also requires exercising well. They hold morning exercises at 7:00 AM and practice deep breathing. All teachers and students attend. At 11:00 AM, there is large muscle exercise, at 3:30 PM, there are games, from 4:20 PM to 5:00 PM, there are outdoor activities, from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, there is bathing, and before bed, there is massage. For the first three weeks of sunbathing, it is held at 9:00 AM every morning. For the last three weeks, morning exercises are changed to sunbathing exercises. Outdoor activities from 4:10 PM to 5:00 PM. The advantage of sunbathing and sunbathing exercises is that the ultraviolet light in the sun penetrates the skin, only penetrating to a thin layer of the skin, which is absorbed by the capillaries, increasing the speed of metabolism, making people have a good appetite and strong resistance. It's like adding new coal in the middle, making the fire burn and the heat increase. However, people with fever who are exposed to sunlight will burn even more severely, and there have been cases of people with lung disease dying from sun exposure. Therefore, children with fever cannot be exposed to sunlight. There is another type of child with yellow hair and brown eyes, which proves that their skin is fragile and cannot withstand too much sun exposure. They are prone to sun poisoning. The symptoms of poisoning include headache, insomnia, and irritability, starting with pus-filled blisters on the skin, and even death. For this type of child, each time can only be exposed for about five minutes, extending to about ten minutes. The sunbathing time for ordinary children should also be gradually increased. In the plains, start with five minutes and increase by one minute each day, up to twenty minutes or half an hour. Sunbathing once or once turning the skin black is harmful and useless. The skin becomes black, the cells die, and ultraviolet light cannot penetrate it. It is the same as not sunbathing, unless you wait until the skin peels off before proceeding. This camp pays close attention to these points for sunbathing and sunbathing exercises. They asked Dr. Gao Jinglang to select four children who could not be exposed to the sun and held separate classes. When exposed, they only wore a short pair of thin pants, their eyes were covered with black gauze, and their heads were also covered to prevent the sun from hurting their eyes and causing dizziness. Since the implementation, the results have been good, and the number of people with colds has decreased. Sports news.</p>

<h3 id="e270">Essentials of Shortwave Transmitters (1) <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiancun</p>
<p>(1) Overview of Shortwave Transmitters</p>
<p>Currently, most of the transmitters (Transmitter) used in our wireless radio industry, except for the old freighters or schools that still use spark-type, are vacuum tube types. Considering the transmission methods of vacuum tubes, they can be roughly divided into the following two categories.</p>
<p>(1) Self-Excited Transmitter (2) Externally Excited (Power Amplifier Type) Vacuum Tube Control Crystal Control</p>
<p>The so-called self-excited (Self Oscillator System) refers to a type that uses a vacuum tube for oscillation itself to make the antenna oscillate. Generally, small power transmitters mostly use this type. Although most amateur transmitters belong to this transmission method, it is quite difficult to prevent changes in transmission frequency and output. Therefore, it is gradually being abandoned, and even small power ones of several watts are increasingly adopting power amplification.</p>
<p>Power amplification methods are further divided into two types: one is based on a small vacuum tube oscillator or a crystal-controlled oscillator, and the fundamental high frequency is gradually amplified by vacuum tubes in its original state; the other is to absorb (Pick up) the high harmonics and gradually expand the power. In the shortwave field, the latter method is mostly used, and all high-power transmitters generally belong to this method.</p>
<p>The importance of transmitters in wireless radio communication is self-evident, and the following two conditions that generally should be met must be considered in advance:</p>
<p>(1) Stability of High Frequency (2) Good Tone Quality</p>
<p>Instability of high frequency can hinder other communications, which is self-evident, and it is also impossible to fully conduct the communication of this station. However, in order to stabilize the oscillating high frequency, there is currently no other good method other than using crystals. In addition, attention should be paid to other equipment, and changes should be seriously prevented. Therefore, international coordination is essential.</p>
<p>Whether the tone is good or not is also greatly related to the communication speed or the removal of mixed sounds. The tone we most desire is the so-called pure direct current (P.D.C.), because it can emit clear and distinct sounds. Therefore, if there are a small amount of noise or signals of impure tones nearby, it is also easy to separate them.</p>
<p>The reason why vacuum tubes can be used as oscillators is entirely due to their amplification characteristics. If the tuned output circuit of the vacuum tube amplifier is coupled to the input circuit, even if the change in the current of the output circuit returns to the input circuit, the amplitude will also be expanded due to the re-amplification effect, and the voltage of the output circuit will inevitably reach a certain limit. However, if this state is exceeded, an oscillation effect will occur. Therefore, even if no voltage is applied from the outside, this circuit itself will continue to oscillate. In vacuum tube oscillators, the grid side is usually used as the input circuit, and the screen side is used as the output circuit.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Attenuation in Radios <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>When a radio receives audio from a distant location, the sound fluctuates, sometimes loud, sometimes soft. In radio science, this phenomenon is called attenuation (Fading).</p>
<p>According to the research results of general radio experts, the reason for attenuation is said to be: due to the mutual interference of sky waves. Originally, after the radio wave is output from the antenna on the transmitter, part of it travels along the ground, which is called the ground wave (Ground Wave); part of it is directly emitted into the sky, which is called the sky wave (Sky Wave). The ground wave travels from the transmitting point to the receiving point along the ground, and its distance is constant. The sky wave reaches the receiving point entirely relying on the Heaviside Laver in the air for reflection. However, the distance between the Heaviside Layer and the ground often changes (the distance is approximately from 100 miles to 200 miles), so the length of the sky wave travel also changes accordingly. The unchanging ground wave meets the constantly changing sky wave, sometimes in phase (InPhase), sometimes out of phase (Out of Phase). When in phase, the ground and sky waves help each other, and the audio signal is naturally strong; when out of phase, the ground and sky waves push against each other, and the audio signal is naturally reduced, or even disappears completely!</p>
<p>Experience and facts tell us that sometimes the strength of external radio waves does not change, but the received audio signal is still inconsistent, which cannot but make people shift their focus and blame the radio itself.</p>
<p>Indeed, a poorly installed radio or internal damage can also cause the received audio signal to fluctuate. The following are the most common points:</p>
<p>(1) The ground and sky wires have been used for a long time, and the winding connections have become loose.</p>
<p>(2) The antenna itself is too thick and sways with the wind, sometimes coming into contact with external grounded objects (such as large trees, roof tiles, etc.).</p>
<p>(3) The vacuum tube is poorly designed, or after being used for a long time, the cathode electron emission is abnormal, and the screen current is also unstable. — This type of vacuum tube sometimes must be burned for a certain period of time before it becomes abnormal. It is often difficult to detect by relying on the short-term test of the vacuum tube calibrator (Tube Checker). Therefore, when encountering this situation, if there is a ready-made vacuum tube at hand, it is best to replace it with a new one.</p>
<p>(4) Bypass or filter capacitor leakage — This is the biggest reason for the occurrence of attenuation in radios. Modern radios have a very small volume, and the temperature inside the machine is extremely high when opened. The position where air flows is even more insignificant. In this way, poorly designed capacitors are naturally more likely to be damaged. Especially the once-popular adhesive-type (Dry Electrolytic Condensei) capacitors are more affected by high temperatures. However, this type of capacitor is tested to be very perfect at ordinary indoor temperatures. Therefore, in case of this situation, it is still best to replace it with a new product using the same method as above. However, when replacing it, before determining which capacitor is actually damaged, there is no need to remove the original ones one by one, just cut off the end where it is connected to the ground wire.</p>
<p>In addition, various transformers, low-frequency choke coils, or speaker designs may be flawed, and the iron core is often saturated (Saturation); and the instability of the numerical value of inferior carbon resistors, etc., will also change the output volume of the radio. Here, for the sake of space, I will not go into details. In short, if you want to get good results when installing a radio, it is best to absolutely avoid using inferior products.</p>
<h3 id="e272">Design Points of Intermediate Frequency Amplification <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>The reason why superheterodyne radios are superior to tuned high-frequency types is because they add an intermediate frequency amplification section. The so-called intermediate frequency has a very wide range, approximately from IooKC to 500KC. When designing an intermediate frequency amplification stage, a suitable frequency must first be determined. The criteria for selection are: first, it must avoid the direct capture of signals from strong local long-wave radio stations; second, the frequency must be as low as possible to obtain better amplification, but it must not be too low, so as not to mix into the audio range. Finally, because the characteristic curve of a vacuum tube used for amplification can never be a true straight line, even if the input signal voltage is a pure sine curve, it will inevitably be distorted after amplification, and harmonics will be generated. If these harmonics are within the broadcast range, they will be repeatedly input into the radio and cause interference. Based on the above three points, the most suitable intermediate frequency for broadcast radios should be 175KC. Its second harmonic 350KC and third harmonic 525KC are also not within the broadcast band. Almost all imported radios use this frequency for the intermediate frequency stage. For shortwave radios, 445KC to 465KC is usually the most suitable standard.</p>
<p>The fourth harmonic of 175KC is 700KC, and even the eighth harmonic is still within the broadcast band. Although they are very weak, they can also cause unexpected obstacles to the radio. Therefore, the tuning circuit and vacuum tubes of the intermediate frequency stage must be isolated and sealed one by one.</p>
<p>The vacuum tube for the intermediate frequency amplification stage should preferably be a tetrode screen grid tube or a strong high amplification tube, such as Nos. 35 and 78, because this type of vacuum tube can obtain higher amplification.</p>
<p>The number of stages in the intermediate frequency amplification section depends on the amplification required and can be calculated using the following formula: Required Amplification = Excitation Voltage Required for Detection Stage / Output Voltage of High Frequency Amplification Stage</p>
<p>For example, if the excitation voltage required for the grid of the detection tube is 4V (RMS) and the signal is amplified to .3V after passing through the high frequency stage and input to the intermediate frequency stage, then the amplification required for the intermediate frequency amplification section is 133.3V. If only one stage of intermediate frequency is used to obtain such a strong amplification, it is naturally impossible. Therefore, it must be divided into two stages, with each stage approximately 65V, or divided into three stages, with each stage 44V.</p>
<h3 id="e273">New Uses for Vacuum Tubes <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Qun</p>
<p>It goes without saying that vacuum tubes are the brains of radio, but now their uses can be applied to almost any technology. For example, geologists use them for prospecting, chemists use them to improve their refining methods, mechanical engineers use them to control machines, industrialists use them to inspect goods, etc. There are countless examples. This article briefly describes two of its new uses. (1) Using Vacuum Tubes to Measure Length. Length is most conveniently measured directly. If the length is extremely short, then another method must be used. For example, there is a thin plate, placed on horizontal supports at both ends, and the middle section has a certain deflection due to its own weight (Desletion). If another weight is added to the plate, its deflection will inevitably increase as a result. Suppose this weight is equal to the weight of a fly, then the increased deflection is almost impossible for the human eye to discern. However, vacuum tubes can be used to measure it. The method is to use the beat phenomenon of two oscillating tubes (Beat Phenomena). This increased deflection is used to change the distance between the two metal plates of a capacitor. And this capacitor is used to control the frequency of tube A. There is another tube B, whose frequency is exactly the same as the original frequency of tube A, for example, 10,000 frequency. If the frequency of tube A changes due to the reduction of the distance between the two metal plates of its capacitor by 10.7cm (its length is only ten times the diameter of an atom), then tubes A and B can generate beats once per second. The number of these beats can be easily detected. We can use this principle to check whether the cross-sectional diameter of copper wire is correct when it is drawn. The rollers that press the copper wire are connected to the movable plate of the capacitor of tube A. If the diameter of the wire is smaller or larger than a certain limit, then the current generated by the beat can trigger the machine to stop working. Other similar tasks can also be controlled.</p>
<p>(2) Using Vacuum Tubes to Measure Time. The measurement of time is an important task in physics. However, the swing of the pendulum of a standard clock is often affected by temperature changes, which affect its length. Therefore, the accuracy of the clock also changes frequently. However, the frequency of a quartz oscillator changes very little with temperature. If a Lozenge-shaped quartz crystal is used, it only changes the frequency by one millionth per degree Celsius. Mr. Marrison of the Bell Telephone Laboratory in the United States used this point to create a quartz-controlled clock (Quartz Clock), whose accuracy is better than the best pendulum clock. Its basic circuit, as shown in the first diagram, is a 100,000 frequency quartz-controlled oscillator, equipped with three output circuits, so that it can be connected to the various components of this clock. The capacitor C connected to the quartz crystal can change the frequency as small as one ten-millionth of a wave. However, the rotation of the hands of the clock can never be achieved by a current of 100,000 frequency. Therefore, a submultiple generator (Submultiple Generator) is needed to generate low-frequency current. It is known that when two oscillators are coupled, there is a very significant synchronization (Syncbronisin) effect. If there is an unstable oscillator with many harmonics, whose main wave frequency is about 10,000, and it is coupled with this 100,000 frequency quartz-controlled oscillator, then the tenth harmonic (TenchHarmonic) of the former is synchronized with the latter, and the main wave in the screen circuit of the former must also be exactly 10,000 frequency, and its stability is no different from the 100,000 frequency one. If there is another unstable oscillator with many harmonics, whose main wave is 1,000 frequency, and it is coupled with the 10,000 one, then the tenth harmonic of this 1,000 frequency oscillator will be synchronized with the 10,000 frequency one. Therefore, we can obtain a stable oscillation with a frequency of 1,000. This 1,000 frequency wave is then used to rotate a synchronous motor (SynchronsusMotor). On its shaft are installed generators with 100 frequency and 10 frequency each, so that the low-frequency waves required for the rotation of the clock hands can be generated. And the stability of the frequency is similar to that of the quartz-controlled 100,000 frequency oscillator. Astronomers have said that if this clock is further improved, the difference in the time required for the Earth to rotate each day can also be measured.</p>

<p>— A Know-It-All</p>
<p>If we have old and unused aluminum variable capacitors, we can convert them into electrolytic capacitors. How to do it? Disassemble the aluminum variable capacitor, removing the aluminum plates (if they are from the moving plate set, stack the moving plate sets together; if they are from the fixed plate set, stack the fixed plate sets together; each set can be made into an electrolytic capacitor). Drill four small holes on the edge of each plate, and insert wooden (or even better, glass) spacer rings between the plates to prevent them from touching. Then, thread four aluminum wires through the small holes of each plate, leading them out to the outside of the plates, and twist the four aluminum wires into a bundle to form an aluminum plate assembly. Place this assembly in an aluminum cup, ensuring that the aluminum plates formed by the aluminum wire assembly are isolated from the aluminum plate with insulators.</p>
<p>After the electrolytic capacitor is made this way, mix the following solution to pour into it:</p>
<p>Glycerin 100 cubic centimeters</p>
<p>Boric acid 62 cubic centimeters</p>
<p>Ammonia water 50 cc or 26%</p>
<p>After pouring in the liquid, it needs to be charged with DC voltage to cause polarization on the aluminum plates. When the plate is connected to DC voltage for charging, the leakage current is very large, so a resistor must be connected in series to obtain an appropriate current. The power supply device should not be overloaded and damaged. As the aluminum plate surface of the capacitor gradually develops a polarized skin, the current will slowly decrease. Then gradually reduce the value of the resistor until it is removed. If the leakage current has reached the minimum limit, then this electrolytic capacitor has been made. The maximum DC voltage for charging the electrolytic capacitor is 400 volts. The lower the voltage used, the higher the capacitance. The aluminum can is the cathode, and the aluminum wire led out is the anode. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e277">Records of Customs and Scenery in Miao Area (3) <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Jue</p>
<p>Miao women are also capable of spinning ramie and weaving cloth. Their looms are short, and the cloth woven on the ground is extremely strong and durable.</p>
<p>Besides farming and weaving, the Miao people only engage in animal husbandry. Therefore, there are the most cattle, horses, dogs, sheep, pigs, cats, chickens, and ducks in the Miao area. The Miao people raise cattle not for farming, but only for food, resources, and trade.</p>
<p>The Miao people's agricultural tools include plows, harrows, hoes, sickles, long-handled knives, axes, baskets, carrying cages, carrying yokes, well sweeps, waterwheels, weaving tools such as looms, shuttles, spinning wheels, and silkworm baskets. Food utensils include tripods, pots, pans, woks, bowls, chopsticks, spoons, and basins. Clothing includes necklaces, bracelets, hairnets, and clothes. Utensils include measuring cups, scales, scissors, needles, awls, rulers, combs, pestles, and grinding stones. Miscellaneous tools include firearms, sticks, ring knives, bows, crossbows, helmets, and leather armor. Musical instruments include gongs, drums, horns, reed pipes, painted horns, waist drums, and cymbals. All are made by themselves and can be used properly.</p>
<p>When Miao people go to the market to trade with the people, they drive cattle and horses and carry local products such as miscellaneous grains and cloth, to the market. Grain is measured with four small bowls as one liter, and cloth is measured with two hand-widths as four feet. The value of cattle and horses is determined by the number of fists. The method is to fasten a bamboo ring around the front ribs of the cattle to determine its width, and then measure the ring. Water buffaloes reaching sixteen fists are considered large, and yellow cattle reaching thirteen fists are considered large, called "fist cattle." Those with less are rare. For horses, age is considered, and a wooden stick is used to compare to the saddle position, counting from the ground. A height of thirteen fists is considered large. Fewer teeth and more fists mean a higher price, and vice versa is inferior, called "comparing horses." The Miao people generally exchange miscellaneous grains, cloth, cattle, and horses with the local people for salt, silkworm seeds, and utensils.</p>
<p>There are also self-employed traders in Miao villages, but rich Miao lend to poor Miao with very high interest. One thousand coins or one stone of grain can increase to several times in three years. If they cannot repay, they are replaced with mountain land and clothing. Although the poor Miao are exploited, they depend on it for a living, so there is nothing they can do. After the mountain land is replaced, they have no land to cultivate and must seek to rent land for cultivation. However, after renting land, they can only listen to the rich Miao's orders, and their lives are at their mercy. Therefore, they often instigate revenge killings, and no one refuses. The Miao people value life lightly and are prone to fighting. At the slightest disagreement, they brew wine and slaughter cattle, invite relatives and friends, and engage in armed battles, called "revenge killings."</p>
<p>Near Baozi Field and Zhengdaying, some Miao villages have opened shops along the main roads to trade. Merchants from Guizhou and Hunan who transport cattle pass through and stay at their homes, which is no different from ordinary inns. They know how to respect merchants, charge very low prices for firewood, water, and accommodation, and do not exploit merchants. If guests leave early and ask them to escort them, they will carry spears and protect them for dozens of miles. If they encounter Miao people lying in ambush in other villages, they will make Miao language calls. The Miao lying in ambush will not dare to offend. If the Miao lying in ambush do not retreat, they will fight with their spears, called "protecting guests."</p>
<p>When Miao children can walk, they burn iron stones and brand their heels and soles to make them callous and insensitive, so they can walk on thorns and stumps without injury. When children grow up, they are made to forge steel into knives, which they use for life. To test the knife, they must place the blade under the neck of a bull and bear it on their shoulders. If the bull dies immediately, it is a good knife.</p>
<p>The Miao crossbow is called "biased frame," which is drawn with one foot and the arrow is passed with the hand behind the back, often hitting the target. The gun is called "pole," which is more than two feet long and is used to protect the crossbow. Therefore, in battle, there must be one crossbow and one gun, moving forward together. The arrows used by the Miao people are often poisoned with hundreds of insects, so people who are hit will die immediately.</p>
<p>The Miao bird gun is extremely well-made. The iron tube is turned several times and polished smoothly so that the bullet is not obstructed. The bullet chamber and the firing mechanism are all well-designed. Saltpeter and sulfur are produced everywhere in the caves and mountains, and are mixed with ash from the *k'ou* tree. The smoke is white and easy to ignite. When the smoke is seen, the bullet has arrived, and can reach dozens of yards away. When encountering an enemy, they must first choose an earthen mound or rock crevice, hide and ambush, and fire the gun to attack the enemy. After firing the gun, they retreat ten steps from the bushes and hide elsewhere to prevent retaliation. The Tujia, Yao, and other ethnic groups hide in the same way as the Miao people in armed conflicts. However, when firing the gun, they must carefully observe the movement of the weeds, called "catching grass," which can often hit the target. Therefore, the Tujia and Yao people are feared by the Miao people.</p>

<p>— Qinglin</p>
<p>(Gunner Zhang) is an unsung hero in the January 28th Anti-Japanese War. He was from Shandong, surnamed Zhang, and belonged to the Fifth Army. He was only an upper private, but because he was good at aiming and shooting, his brothers in the same unit called him (Gunner Zhang). One morning, when the war was raging and the gunfire was intense, the enemy was aggressive and launched a fierce attack on us. Not to mention, they were fighting under the cover of airplanes, which gave them an advantage. Although our army was poorly equipped and had no air cover, our morale was very strong. Driven by righteous indignation, we did not hesitate to meet the enemy head-on. At that time, the North Station had not yet fallen. The artillery battalion headquarters to which Gunner Zhang belonged was temporarily set up at the railway station. The artillery was also set up on it. This battalion adopted guerrilla tactics and was ordered to assist in the battle. When we gradually showed signs of weakness, we suddenly heard the roar of artillery coming from behind, and the enemy's formation was disrupted. The atmosphere had changed, and our morale was naturally greatly boosted. It turned out that two-thirds of the shells fired by Gunner Zhang hit the enemy's vital points. As a result of this battle, our army turned defeat into victory in a critical situation, all thanks to Gunner Zhang's unparalleled feat.</p>
<p>After that, every morning or at night, Zhang fired a dozen shots from the train to demoralize the enemy, almost as a routine. The British and American soldiers stationed in the area bordering the Chinese Concession admired his leisurely spirit. Therefore, the Western newspapers at the time praised him to the extreme. Some people said: After January 28th, the North Station was able to hold out for thirty-one days. Although it was due to the unyielding and desperate resistance of the soldiers, the biggest reason was indeed due to Gunner Zhang. The enemy's courage was inherently small, and they always tried to gain advantage through momentum, especially not being able to engage in hand-to-hand combat. They were extremely afraid of Gunner Zhang's shells, and they had very keen hearing. As long as it was a shell fired by Zhang, they could detect it, and there was overwhelming evidence that the shells fired by others in our army were not as ruthless as Gunner Zhang's. In the blink of an eye, the green smoke passed, and the enemy's corpses were lying in all directions!</p>
<h3 id="e279">Indian Asan <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>Although Indians in Shanghai each have their own unique surnames and given names, they are uniformly called "Indian Asan" by the general Chinese population.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, at least five out of ten Indian Asans, in addition to their regular occupations, also engage in the highly profitable usury business. The interest rates they charge are usually one jiao per yuan per month, and they deduct one month's interest in advance. That is to say, if you borrow one hundred yuan from an Indian Asan, you actually receive ninety yuan, and after one month, you must fully repay one hundred yuan. If you borrow one hundred yuan and it takes four months to repay the principal and interest, you must pay no less than one hundred and thirty-three yuan.</p>
<p>Although Indian Asans can speak Shanghainese, they cannot read Chinese characters, so the loan documents are usually written by the Indian Asans themselves, and the borrower just puts a fingerprint on the loan document. However, the amount written on the loan document by the Indian Asan is often five times larger than the amount the borrower actually receives. For a loan of fifty yuan, they always fill in two hundred and fifty yuan. Some even ask the debtors to put a fingerprint on a blank piece of paper. Once the debtor wants to default, the Indian Asan will write a number on it himself and go to court to sue.</p>
<p>The regular occupations of Indian Asans are mostly police officers and doorkeepers. Although their salaries are only thirty or forty yuan a month, none of them fail to save three to five yuan a month by tightening their belts and living frugally, and exploiting our Chinese compatriots, who drink poison to quench their thirst and do not seek progress. Therefore, someone from a certain country said that Indians are Asans, and Chinese are Asis.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I looked at it and often had a kind of delusion. I don’t know if the dog itself knows the preferential treatment and the importance of its position; but whether it knows it or not, the situation is always true! And I can say with certainty that if anything happened to this dog, or it was injured, or ate something bad, or suddenly got lost; as long as anything happened, everyone in the palace would be alarmed, and the impact would be far greater than the death of a eunuch, there is no doubt about that.</p>
<p>However, this dog still relied on the Empress Dowager's protection to have such power. Although many of the ministers residing in the capital also liked to raise dogs, the situation was, of course, as different as heaven and earth.</p>
<p>(13) On the Road</p>
<p>The train finally proceeded along the Beijing-Fengtian Line. We, eight female officials, together with Zhang De, and his gang of eunuchs, stood beside the Empress Dowager like wooden puppets sculpted in a temple. Everyone was excited, ready to admire the various wonders of this long journey: but no one dared to show a trace of excitement on their faces, not even daring to look out of the window, as if nothing had happened. Our car departed around four o'clock in the afternoon, and the first stop was Fengtai. Fengtai is only eleven kilometers away from Beijing, equivalent to a flag station of Beijing Station. Our train, in this short distance, paced forward slowly like an ox; even though it was driving so slowly, we still dared not believe that the Empress Dowager would be satisfied. As long as the car rolled a little unnaturally, she would feel unhappy. (108)</p>

<p>— Muyin</p>
<p>Rather than saying this is a comedy, it is better to say it is a tragedy!</p>
<p>After Miss Man discovered this little secret. The fact is this:</p>
<p>Miss Man has a mirror, and she always wipes it very clean every day. However, when she runs into the room for lunch every day, she always sees a little greasy stain on the edge of the mirror. She thinks unhappily in her heart, (Who is it? How annoying, doing this every day!)</p>
<p>However, the truth will eventually be revealed one day. When she ran into the room one morning, she saw Zhang Ma - the maid, holding a rag in one hand and a mirror in the other, admiring herself, as if sighing:</p>
<p>(Alas! I am already so old!)</p>
<p>Zhang Ma is an old woman in her fifties.</p>
<p>Miss Man finds it too interesting! But no one, especially a woman, wants to let herself grow old. Thirty years ago, although Zhang Ma was not necessarily beautiful, she had some virgin beauty anyway. Now that youth has passed and the traces of aging have been deeply engraved on her face, she cannot forget the mirror, so she does this every day, admiring herself, as if sighing:</p>
<p>(Alas! I am already so old!)</p>
<p>Really, rather than saying this is a comedy, it is better to say it is a tragedy!</p>

<p>— Zhu Xi</p>
<p>▲Commercialized Education The suicides of the Peking University student organization "Occupational Sports Federation" and Zhao Wanqing, a graduate of the History Department of Nanjing Central University, bluntly show that China's education is not yet correct! College graduates from our country's top universities are still unable to find suitable jobs after graduation, and the difficulty of finding jobs for other high school graduates who are unable to pursue further education is even more tragic. As a result, a group of education experts, seeing that the situation is unfavorable, are preparing to create some kind of production education, livelihood education, and life education. Whether these three types of education can break the current bankruptcy of (graduation is unemployment) and the crisis in education is still a question. However, it is always a ridiculous and doubtful thing to expect a traditionally scholarly educator to immediately change his style and become an old farmer who personally holds a rake and hoe! However, schools do everything possible to scrape money from students in terms of tuition fees. At the beginning of the entrance examination, they first charge a registration fee of one yuan. This fee was originally intended to limit students from taking the examination frivolously, and those who were not accepted would be refunded. However, now, whether they are accepted or not, they are all confiscated. As for those who are accepted, in addition to tuition and boarding fees, there are various additional harsh taxes and miscellaneous fees. Here are some of the most common additional fees in schools: (gymnasium fee), (construction fee), (practical fee), (library fee), (medical fee), (compensation fee), (uniform fee), (lighting and water fee), and the proper book fee is not included. A student's additional harsh taxes and miscellaneous fees are at least about ten kinds, and the expenses for temporary accidents are not included. The school authorities simply regard the school as a business store, calculating on money all day long, no wonder they have no time to take care of the students' future. Therefore, I believe that in this era of advocating production education, the first thing to pay attention to is schools that are advancing commercialized education!</p>
<p>▲Resistance to Foreign Goods and Imports of Cosmetics During the Women's National Goods Year, which was noisy and lively, Shanghai's modern women held a large parade and rowed dragon boats to promote national goods and boycott foreign goods. They advanced on land and water, which was truly magnificent and admirable. However, in the past six months, the number of imported perfumes and cosmetics has reached more than 852,000 yuan. This break from the historical trade deficit is enough to make people gasp! Now, according to a detailed investigation, the consumption of these cosmetics is not on the face, but on two fat thighs. This really does not allow people to sigh deeply, sighing that the women's world has no conscience at all! Women who put powder on their thighs are certainly not country women who pick green onions and sell leeks, or domestic servants who carry baskets to buy vegetables. Then, the women who consume these cosmetics, in addition to a group of poor worms who sell their bodies, are those modern women who advocate bare legs. I dare not say whether any of these women who put powder on their legs participated in the resistance to foreign goods parade or dragon boat propaganda in the past, but this huge cosmetics trade deficit clearly exposes the failure of Shanghai's women's world to resist foreign goods! It is not only shameful but also painful to continue to advocate resistance to foreign goods! Alas! The so-called Women's National Goods Year!</p>
<p>▲New Life and Men and Women Because the Chinese authorities advocated the New Life Movement of (propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame), a group of intelligent people have gone too far. After prohibiting men and women from swimming together, they have also come up with prohibiting men and women from walking, eating, or staying in hotels together in order to win the good name of maintaining the New Life. This kind of pedantic argument that goes too far is not only troublesome and inconvenient, but even if it is implemented, if people's hearts are not improved, what good will it do for the national economy and people's livelihood! At a time when it is strictly forbidden for men and women to swim and travel together in the Southeast, Yang's daughter, who went to the New Life Water Sports, was personally driven by Chu Minyi, the secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, disguised as a coachman, to pull the horse for the mermaid, and Ms. Yang Xiuqiong went to the beach swimming pool to perform, and there were police officers to protect her. On the one hand, promoting the New Life is like this; on the other hand, promoting the New Life is like that. In this contradictory state, the old folks for men and women across the country, don't really know what the new life is!</p>

<p>▲ Initial Losses, Second Half Slightly Recovers - Yesterday's Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the Market Was Extremely Chaotic. Initially, the Atmosphere in the Market Was Poor, and Rumors Were Rampant. In Addition, the Russo-Japanese Situation Was Tense, and There Was a Rumor of Issuing One Hundred Million Yuan in New Public Bonds, Believed to Be Needed for the Fifth Plenary Session. Many Retail Bull Parties Became More Panicked, Sentiment Was Weak, but Because Major Players Suddenly Had a Need, Bear Parties Made Profits to Offset and Also Surged, and the Market Price Actually Declined and Then Recovered. Speculating on the Future, There Is No Major Rally Now, and Doing More Does Not Seem to Be the Time. The Number Four Position in the Field Comes and Goes, Which Is Pivotal to the Market. Its Entries and Exits Have Great Courage and Cannot Be Taken Lightly. Yesterday's Process, Opening Price Cuts of Three to Four Corners Immediately After the Troop Reduction, and the Layoff Cut Even More Five to Six Corners. The Selling Air in the Market Was Extremely Strong, But Number Four Did Not Need It. From the 20th Pass, Although the Sellers Were Still Eager, Buyers Were Relatively Stronger, So It Actually Declined and Then Recovered, Good By One Corner to Three Corners, and the Situation Was Chaotic. Number Four Took the Opportunity to Raise Prices in the Second Half, and the Troop Reduction Rose Sharply by Three to Four Corners. Although the Layoff Didn't Buy, Sentiment Had Changed and Was Also Good for Four and a Half Corners. After This, the Opportunity to Shift Gears, All Were Good. Number Four Also Had Bought Unified Salt Tax, So They All Turned Up by Three to Four Corners, and the Trend Seemed to Have Changed. However, Number Four's Buying, Whether There Is Continued Ability, Is Quite Relevant, Because Sentiment Still Feels That There Has Been No Revitalization, and Do More Are Not Yet Active. The Resulting Market Price Also Returned To One Corner To Four Or Five Corners. This Month, The Twenty-Second Pass Was Uniquely Good By Seven Corners, of Which Only The Cut Layoff The 19th Pass Good But Small One Corner To Six Corners.

<p>▲ New York Stock Market Still Quiet - Xinfeng Foreign Firm Reports That Yesterday (16th) The New York Stock Market Remained In A Hovering Situation Due To Government Opposition To Commodity Speculation. Individual Stocks Rose, The Main Part Was Slightly Firmer Than Before, Transactions Remained As Quiet As Before, And There Was No Improvement At All. Due To The Drought, The Value Of The Inventory Of Food Companies Has Increased Invisibly, So This Kind Of Stock Market Is Quite Strong, Railway Stocks Are Also Good, But Construction Stocks Have Become Unstable, Because Speculators Re-Evaluated The Housing Renovation Plan and Believed That It Would Not Benefit Large Companies Much. The Small Stock Exchange Slightly Increased Under The Leadership Of Public Utility Shares and Mining Shares. Bond Market Sentiment Was Quite Strong, The Market Rose With American Government Bonds and Speculative Railway Bonds. Commodities Fell First and Then Rose, Weather News Was Favorable to Short Sellers, And At The Same Time Speculators Were Extremely Cautious To Prevent Government Curbing Speculative Actions. The Total Volume of Transactions Throughout the Day Was 610,000 Shares. The Dow Jones Index Is Listed On The Left: Fifteenth Sixteenth Ups and Downs</p>

<p>The Yarn Market is Very Weak, the Downturn is More Intense, Although Money Exchange Groups Limit Prices to Buy This Month, But The Hearts of Retail Investors Are Bad, And It Is Difficult To Support The Building Alone, But The Sales of Current Yarn Can Still Be Maintained. However, The Price of Flowers Has Fallen For Several Days, Resulting in the Fundamental Loosening of the Yarn Market. As a Result, Speculators Have Been Selling Because Yarn Prices Are Higher Than Flower Prices, But The Money Exchange Department's Bull Department Is Struggling Hard.</p>

<p>The Opening Market Was Still Good in the Future Bidding of Future Yarn, But the Market Suddenly Changed in the Second and Third Bids. Because The Cotton Market Has Gone Down, The Situation is Quite Weak. Yarn Prices Are Higher Than Flower Prices. The Average Speculator Changed His Policy, And The Selling Air is Sharp. Each Month Fell One to Four and Eight Corners, And The Distance Fell Nine Corners to One Yuan. In the Afternoon Market, Rumors That News At The Time Was Unfavorable and The Selling Air Was More Intense. Although The Money Exchange Department Has A Limited Price Of 184.5 Yuan This Month, It Is Still Difficult To Curb the Selling Air. Therefore, The Downturn in the Opening Round Was Particularly Strong, But The Closing Price Showed A Slight Rebound. As a Result, Each Month Fell By Another Five Six Seven Corners To One Yuan and One Corner. A Total of 44,000 Packages Were Traded Throughout the Day. Sold Xincheng 1,100 Packages, Runkang 700 Packages, Yuan Yi 1,500 Packages, Yukang 650 Packages, Dafu 850 Packages, Renfeng 1,800 Packages, Hiesheng 1,600 Packages, Huikang 3,000 Packages, Shenji 1,100 Packages, Yuanda 700 Packages Bought Yichang 4,500 Packages Hengchang 2,700 Packages, Yuan Yi 750 Packages, Tongji 1,400 Packages, Jifeng 950 Packages, Suilong 900 Packages, Senkang 750 Packages.

Because The Weather Has Been Favorable Lately, And Foreign Cotton Has No Power to Rise. People Are Greatly Panicked. It Is Rumored That Japanese Merchants Are Also Selling. Therefore, The Market is Quite Weak. However, Recently New Cotton Has Been Released, And Chinese and Foreign Factories Have Started to Operate Slightly. Judging From the Market Situation, The Situation Is Weaker, And The Seller's Pressure Is Very Heavy.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market opened slightly lower in the morning, with a decline in American cotton prices. A sudden drop in the second and third rounds of bidding occurred, as new cotton prices were lower than forward cotton. This caused widespread panic. As a result, prices for all months fell by 1.3 to 0.5 taels. The market weakened in the afternoon, following the yarn market. The second and third rounds of bidding saw particularly sharp declines, with new lows reached for all months. However, prices rebounded by 0.05 to 0.1 taels before closing.

<p>--Sales Not Active-- Tianjin Correspondence: The Xihe cotton market situation is fluctuating, and the trend has turned weak again. The number of transactions has decreased. However, foreign merchants were active the day before, with Anli &amp; Co. purchasing 1,040 bales at prices ranging from 39 yuan to 39.5 yuan. Also, manufacturers are again interested in Xihe American cotton. Market sentiment varies due to differences in quality. Yuda Yarn Mill purchased 100 bales, with prices quoted at 44.5 yuan. Donghe long-staple cotton is still easy to trade in small quantities, and the market situation is better. Yuda purchased 60 bales, with prices quoted at 46 yuan. Manufacturers have a slight interest in Beihe long-staple cotton, with only Yuda Mill buying 40 bales, with prices quoted at 44 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially strengthened due to positive news from Liverpool, but later weakened due to profit-taking by bulls and disappointment from manufacturers. As a result, spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures prices fell by 4 to 7 points. British cotton futures rose by 7-8 points. Indian cotton strengthened due to buying by speculators. As a result, Pingguoer rose by 1.75 rupees, Aomula rose by 3.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 2.25 rupees. The original telegraph is recorded on the left (dated the 16th):</p>

<p>In the flour market, the price of foreign wheat was reported at 34 cents below the Canadian rate, while prices in Chicago and Liverpool all rebounded. There was also demand from merchants for actual sales. Northern merchants continued to ship bulk flour to the north. As a result, market sentiment turned upward again, and factories took a wait-and-see attitude regarding sales. In the afternoon, a large outside bull suddenly bought heavily, and merchants also inquired about covering short positions. The market then suddenly soared. The closing prices were up 4.25 cents for August, 5.5 cents for July, 5.75 cents for October, 6 cents for November, 5 cents for December, and 5.25 cents for January.</p>
<p>Both spot flour and spot wheat were active in the wheat market, and futures wheat was sought after to cover short positions. The opening price rose by 6-7 cents, followed by successive increases. In the afternoon, large long position holders, both inside and outside the industry, bought heavily, and the demand for covering short positions was particularly strong. The market then soared again. The closing price suddenly rose by 18 cents for August, 17 cents for the following month, 16 cents for October, 15 cents each for November and December, and 7 cents for January. After holding firm for many days, spot wheat prices had slightly declined earlier. Yesterday, due to the activity in spot flour, the mills were unwilling to continue to hold firm. As a result, Fufeng and Fuxin sold 25,000-26,000 bags of Xu Zhou and Shandong high-grade wheat at a uniform price of 3.9 yuan, and other wheat at varying prices of 3.7-3.8 yuan, a price improvement of nearly 10 cents compared to the previous market, but slightly less than the previous week.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) The supply from various groups was relatively scarce, arriving at a total of 11-12 groups (a total of 1,300-1,400 stones of goods), mostly late rice, with a small amount of thick粳. Although the late rice had some demand, such as 600+ bags purchased by Qingdao and Weihaiwei, the market still declined by 0.2 yuan. However, for thick粳 rice, the supply from Sutong was relatively scarce, and demand was there, and the price remained stable. Changbang, Nangang, and other粳 rice were still soft. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan also declined by almost 0.1 yuan. New粳 rice was still priced at 11.2 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) The supply from various groups yesterday was over 10 groups. The market situation for various goods has not improved. The price of white粳, Yang Du Jian declined by almost 0.1 yuan, and the price of thin rice declined by around 0.2 yuan. The price of Baoyuan bukejian rice was stable. The sales of new Dongxin粳 rice were similar to the arrivals, and the price was stable. Today, 200 bags of new Keshan new kejian rice from Shashi arrived.

<p>▲Zhangzhou Rice: Tax-paid Delivery▲ Yesterday, the foreign客秈 rice market, due to the continuous arrival of Saigon orders in Shanghai, and new rice from various places heading to Shanghai, there were new arrivals of Xiang Xin rice, Shashi xinzao rice, Taizhou Zhangzhou xinji rice, etc. seeking sales. Although the selling households had interest, due to the continuous arrivals, they deliberately took a wait-and-see approach in order to suppress prices before buying. The prices of various客秈 rice slightly declined. The small絞米 rice did not open in the morning, and only in the afternoon did merchants from the local street buy more than 1,000 bags, with those previously priced at 10 yuan now at only 9.7 yuan, and those priced at 9.7-9.8 yuan now at only 9.5 yuan, a sudden drop of 0.2-0.3 yuan compared to the previous market. In addition, the Zhangzhou rice that arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, after being certified as domestic by the Zhangzhou Xiamen Chamber of Commerce, the customs has allowed the rice merchants to take delivery, but they must deposit tax as a security deposit, pending detailed investigation and handling. A total of 4,000 bags of foreign chemical rice were offered in the city, most of which were purchased by merchants from the local street, and only over 1,000 bags by inland merchants.</p>

<p>▲First Batch of Chongming New Sha Yellow Arrives, Over 100 Bags▲ The market for bean cake has been very quiet since the beginning of autumn. Therefore, most of the factories in the city have stopped production. The supply of Shahe 客 bean cake is disconnected, and the inventory is not small. Yesterday, the market suddenly had inquiries from the Xiamen group, and industry insiders also became involved, intending to use autumn bean cake for the Chongming group, leading to a sudden change in the market. The price had to rise by 0.06 yuan in the morning. Approximately 1,300 pieces of edge bean cake were traded, with prices ranging from 1.26 yuan to 1.32 yuan. In addition, there was also 客 bean cake from sand boats, priced at 900 pieces. Yesterday, the market for new and old yellow soybeans continued to decline. Chengmendou continued to fall by 0.35 yuan, early yellow fell by 0.15 yuan, and old soybeans fell by 0.05-0.1 yuan, and its trend is still difficult to stabilize. Among the new soybeans that were launched on the market, there were over 100 bags of Chongming Sha yellow, which were of good quality, but the status was insufficient, and the price was quoted at 3.7 yuan, and purchased by merchants from the local street.</p>
<h3 id="e304">Silk and Tea Foreign Firms' Silk Sales Remain Difficult <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>(Lyon Chinese Silk Appears Strong but is Secretly Weak) As the French exchange rate rises, Chinese silk prices appear strong but are secretly weak. Although there has been no change on the surface in the price of Yellow and White Filature over the past ten days (Grade A White Filature is still at 55.5 francs per kilogram, and Grade B is 51.5 francs), when the exchange rate is factored in, the price per bale in Chinese currency (Grade A) is only 520 yuan and 479 yuan for Grade B. Compared to the beginning of last week (531 yuan for Grade A and 491 yuan for Grade B), they have each fallen by over 10 yuan. French sales of Shanghai Chinese silk remain difficult to progress.</p>
<p>(Chinese Silk Exports Gradually Recover) Chinese silk exports have sharply decreased. In the first six months of the year, only 3,651 bales of silk were exported from Shanghai to foreign countries. However, in the past month (i.e., July), exports have gradually recovered, with 505 bales shipped to the Americas, 601 bales to Europe, 687 bales to Asia, and 252 bales to other ports, totaling 2,045 bales.</p>
<p>(European Firms Take Advantage of Low Prices to Replenish Filature) Due to rising silver prices and continued tightness in foreign exchange, European firms in this port are taking the opportunity to replenish filature. As local manufacturers have ample silk stocks, they are reluctantly selling off stock. Yesterday, Dafeng and others purchased 70 bales of Grade B White Filature, and prices trended upward.</p>
<h3 id="e305">Wuyuan Large Consignments Continue to be Sold <a href="#e305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the tea market in this port, Yingzhuang Jinlong Foreign Firm continued to purchase large consignments of Wuyuan Northern Route green tea. Five to six consignments were sold in the city, and the price remained unchanged compared to before. The sales of Luzhuang Zhenmei tea remained sluggish, and there were no large transactions for Zhen Dun Xiu Mei and other items. Due to foreign demand, foreign firms made some scattered negotiations for Ping Shui Pearl tea, but the recognized price was extremely low. The green tea market is still difficult to consider optimistic. Sugar Market</p>
<h3 id="e306">Taikoo Sugar B Mark Down 0.1 Yuan <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>Although the sugar market saw a slight increase in customs duties yesterday, the trend remained mediocre. The guild's price for 24 crude granulated white spot was 19.6 yuan, and transit goods were 6.4 yuan, with no significant change. Gaotong was 6.45 yuan. Dutch red KNG mark was 15.3 yuan, and transit goods were 6 yuan. Taikoo Sugar B Mark was priced at 20.1 yuan, a decrease of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day, and transit goods were 7.05 yuan, remaining stable. The prices for the cotton white of our own factory Zhenyu Zhenji No. 1 were both 18.7 yuan, a decrease of 0.05 yuan. Only a few dozen bags of ordinary Huanggang Qing from Chaoqing were offered, at 13.8 yuan, Chongti Zhuang at 14.4 yuan, and over 40 bags of Xinghua Qing, which was of better quality, were offered at 12.75 yuan.</p>

<p>Longkou vermicelli have been frequently purchased in whole batches by the Jiangxi gang for military needs recently, leading to a gradual rise in market prices. Land prices have also risen accordingly. According to yesterday's telegraph, the price per bag has risen to approximately 26 yuan. The high-priced goods are offered in the market at 19.5 yuan, although no deal has been reached, the strong demand is already visible. The price has risen by nearly 2 yuan before and after.</p>

<h3 id="e308">The End of Hitler is Nigh <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Recently, American astrologers held an annual meeting in Chicago. Dr. Gordon, who (researches astronomy), declared a prophecy to his colleagues, saying that it is difficult to reverse the fate of the German dictator, and that (the end of Hitler is nigh). This is heaven's will, and was destined long ago when Hitler was born. He also said that according to the celestial phenomena, the world will be in great chaos, and only Russia will be able to live in peace.</p>
<p>Dr. Gordon, who (researches astronomy), actually merges with astrology, and calculates the (horoscopes) of the international situation and the rise and fall of important figures in world politics. One says that it is destined before birth, and the other says that the celestial phenomena indicate it. In addition to lamenting the development of modern social science, and the resulting decline in using it to explain the will of (God), we should also recognize that these (witchcraft cults) are attempting to appear in scientific clothing, which is completely (disrespectful) to science. However, Gordon's speculation about (the end of Hitler is nigh) may become a reality, but the reasons for it are not some (celestial phenomena), but based on the current reality of Germany.</p>
<p>Hitler's rise to power was in an environment of deep domestic revolutionary crisis, economic panic, and difficult foreign policy. He made countless empty promises, won the support of some small-bourgeois middle class (such as the Sturmabteilung), and ran to the position of chancellor. These promises could not be fulfilled when the worldwide economic panic had no way out, and the major powers were already brewing a major war to (redivide the world). In terms of foreign relations, the revision of the Treaty of Versailles and the demand for equal arms first encountered obstacles from Britain and France. No matter how much he barked and left the League of Nations, there was no effect. Turning to the east to develop, recovering the corridor area (Danzig), and wanting to get Russian Ukraine as a colony, he ran head-on into the resistance of the Polish government and the scathing criticism of Litvinov. The meeting between Venice and Mussolini ended in disappointment. Recently, the rebellion of the Austrian National Socialist Party did not realize the ideal of a German-Austrian merger. Although his party killed Dollfuss, it caused Italy to station troops in the Alps and repeatedly declare its maintenance of Austria's independence. All of this has made Hitler's series of national propaganda weapons, such as the Third Reich and the glory of the German nation, fall flat everywhere and run into walls everywhere.</p>
<p>As for domestic affairs, when (Chaplin mustache) took office, he repeatedly declared that solving unemployment and saving the economic crisis were his duties. However, the domestic economic situation not only failed to improve, but deteriorated. The reduction in national gross income, the decline in essential consumer spending, and the sevenfold reduction in current savings in two years are all facts. Although the number of unemployed has decreased slightly, it is not the result of Hitler's economic recovery, but the result of expelling Jews and driving women back to their families. If we count Herr's achievements in the past year or two, it seems that only encouraging reproduction and eliminating reproductive function are his (merits).</p>
<p>These events will inevitably cause the (middle class) who previously supported Hitler to become increasingly disappointed because the promises are empty, and to increase opposition to Herr. The plotting of a coup by the Sturmabteilung contains this meaning. Therefore, Hitler was forced to turn to his (trusted troops) and surrender to the national defense forces. This shows that the German government has abandoned the deception of the small-bourgeois (middle class) and blatantly fallen into the arms of financial and financial giants. However, can the rule of purely financial and financial giants solve Germany's foreign policy of overturning the Treaty of Versailles and its internal economic crisis? Absolutely not. On the contrary, it makes the general public recognize the face of the swastika flag's rule, tends to be fierce, and uses upheaval to overthrow the current rule. The words of that astrologer are probably derived from this.</p>
<h3 id="e309">From Storing Grain to People's Food and Others <a href="#e309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>Our country has never attached importance to the practice of (storing grain for famine prevention). Usually, we always plant and eat as we go, without storing anything. When the year is good, the grain prices are desperately reduced, causing farmers to suffer losses and abnormally promoting the bankruptcy of the rural economy, and the survival of farmers is also on the verge of despair. When the years are bad, the price of rice is arbitrarily raised, and unscrupulous merchants hoard goods and close their warehouses. Once a year of great famine arrives, we have to dig a well when we are thirsty and lose our composure. We have no choice but to purchase foreign rice from abroad to relieve the famine. Our China, which claims to be based on agriculture, cannot imagine that large amounts of foreign rice are imported every year, which is not to be pitied! In contrast, the small Japan, which had to buy rice from our country decades ago, now sells large quantities of rice abroad every year in less than 30 years. Their rapid agricultural advancement is truly astonishing! When I talk about the people's food, I think of a friend, Mr. Wu, who talked to me about the living conditions of the people in the puppet country under Japanese rule. One section is about the people's food problem in the puppet country, which is now excerpted below, and can also be seen in the people's food problem in the puppet country.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I met Mr. Wu, who was sent to the Northeast by the Commercial Press for investigation and returned, and told me some impressions of the puppet country. I asked him about the living conditions of the Northeast compatriots under the Japanese iron hooves. According to him: The people of the Eastern Province are really suffering. They cultivate the fields, but they cannot even get a grain of rice to eat. After harvesting the rice, the grain must be sold to the state completely, because the puppet country has established a large-scale grain storage to prepare for storing grain. Even if there is excess rice, it must be sold to other countries. If the people in the country want to eat rice, then each stone must be around 40 yuan. Therefore, the people here can only eat barley rice, or corn flour, bran, beans, etc. Rice is absolutely never eaten. Only those rich families and noble people can eat it.</p>
<p>They have at least two purposes in doing so: (1) Storing grain for famine prevention, so that the people get used to eating miscellaneous grains; raising the price of rice, that is, encouraging agricultural development, promoting reclamation, and increasing agricultural production. Even if they encounter famine years in one, two, or three years, it is easy to cope with, and they will never run out of food and cause food panic. (2) Storing grain for war, they are a country with military dreams, and are always eager for the enlightenment of the war. If the war breaks out unfortunately in the future, then military grain and people's food are so important? If they do not plan ahead, they will inevitably be flustered at the last minute. They are like this to their own country, and why not to the puppet Manchukuo, which they take care of with one hand and regard as their lifeline? This kind of mature deliberation, near worry and long-term consideration, is truly admirable!</p>
<p>However, what is our country like? Not to mention storing grain, there is no such thing as accumulating grain at all. Therefore, as long as we encounter a year of disaster, there is no way to think about it! Looking back at the disaster images of the three provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, the miserable and heartbreaking images are still vivid in my mind. The cries of the hungry are everywhere, and the starved corpses are everywhere, which is unbearable to see. Occasionally, I recall it, and I cannot help but feel shuddering!</p>
<h3 id="e310">Capital <a href="#e310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— A Ping</p>
<p>Two children—the older sister is fifteen years old, and the younger brother is thirteen years old. They have no parents and no hometown.</p>
<p>When the iron wheels of the garbage truck rolled through this small alley, they scrambled to get up from the corner of the wall. Their dark hands rubbed their eyelids. They did not know that humans had such a thing as washing their faces; wasn't eating more important than washing their faces! Taking up their possessions, a tattered cattail bag and a pair of iron pliers, without a sense of direction, without an office, every garbage can was their treasure trove to be mined.</p>
<p>The two children have been living off scraps for several months.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>.</p>
<p>They didn't join their peers. Invading other people's territories was like being a thief. If they were caught, they would be beaten.</p>
<p>They said this was capital. You can't do business without capital.</p>
<p>Run, run, escape from the eyes of many predators. They discovered a gold and silver mountain.</p>
<p>At the base of a large Western-style house, there was a large pile of beer bottles lying on their sides. Within their territory, it was truly pitifully barren. Sometimes, they couldn't even find something that could be exchanged for a palatable breakfast. Now, the thirteen-year-old jumped up and said (Sister, we can eat a bowl of noodles! At that beef shop.)</p>
<p>Just as two beer bottles were being stuffed into his cattail bag, four peers darted out from the alley.</p>
<p>(Bastards! Beat them! Beat them! Beat them!)</p>
<p>Too late to sound the gong and withdraw the troops, twelve small arms and twelve small legs rolled around on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Two beer bottles, one was snatched back, and one was broken.</p>
<p>Seeing that she was outnumbered, the older sister shouted (Run!), and the two children ran for their lives back to their own territory.</p>
<p>Sitting on the ground by the corner of the wall, the younger brother, hugging the wounds on his legs, said: (Sister, we lost money today!)</p>
<p>(Humph!) Grabbing a handful of dirt and slapping it on the younger brother's wounds, she exchanged a beer bottle from the cattail bag and said: (We don't do business at a loss!)</p>
<p>She stretched out her legs, full of the strength of a hero!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a stream of blood hung down from her leg, (Damn it!) Another handful of dirt.</p>
<p>The younger brother grabbed the beer bottle and carefully examined it.</p>
<p>(This wrapping paper is so fun. A ship. Too bad we don't have that kind of business!)</p>
<p>The sky was gloomy, without the sun. After a while, rain started to fall. They took shelter under the overpass and stared at the sky in a daze.</p>
<p>(It's getting cold!) The younger brother shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>(Damn it! We'll go again tomorrow!) Her legs were full of that same strength again.</p>
<p>(Sister, let's take more capital tomorrow—Atang, Fusheng, and that scab head, we'll beat those bastards to death!)</p>
<p>(Smash!) The beer bottle flew more than five feet away and broke.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a slap flew over, (Good boy, don't say unlucky things! We lost money today!)</p>
<p>The younger brother lowered his head, and the older sister glared at him.</p>
<p>The rain fell harder and harder!</p>
<h3 id="e311">Random Notes from the Sickbed <a href="#e311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>— Black Tea</p>
<p>I knew a long time ago that I had a lung disease. I took some over-the-counter medicine haphazardly and felt a little better. Recently, I coughed up blood, and only then did I realize that my illness was not minor. I rushed to get a checkup, and sure enough, there was already a cavity in the apex of my right lung. So I threw aside everything I should be doing and spent my days foolishly playing and sleeping.</p>
<p>My body has always been weak. Years of Chinese medicine as a child made it even worse. Of course, it wasn't without some benefits. To this day, no matter how bitter or unpalatable the medicine is, I can always swallow it down without even wrinkling my brow.</p>
<p>Because I've been sick so often, I have a deep understanding of everything related to illness. Now, I'll just write a little bit to alleviate the loneliness.</p>
<p>To say something without being embarrassed, I quite enjoy minor illnesses. Because in minor illnesses, you can fully enjoy the warmth of the human world. I remember that when I was at home, I would always fall ill around the third or fourth month of the lunar calendar. At that time, in our Jiang Village, the scenery was especially beautiful. No matter who it was—even my mother, who already had many children and a lot of household chores—would always take a stroll in the small garden during the long afternoons, or peer at the red and green fields through the fence. Even though she often returned with a faint sigh, feeling that life was too hard, she was still full of vitality. Since I fell ill, my mother has stayed with me all day long and rarely goes out. However, when I'm asleep, she always goes out to take a look. At this time, my younger siblings have already been sent away. She always goes to the small garden alone, takes a quick turn, and comes right back. When she returns, I'm naturally still asleep. So she sits quietly, waiting for me to wake up. As soon as I wake up, she slowly tells me about the small garden—which side has a clump of wildflowers blooming, they're purple, and which flower has fallen on the other side. Every one of these things I was mindful of before I got sick. Then I begin to understand the greatness of my mother. No matter what, she's always mindful of what her children are mindful of, even though she no longer has the leisure to simply be mindful of a clump of wildflowers.</p>
<p>As for my younger siblings, they are even more endearing. Because they were instructed by my mother, they don't come into my room often, but every day, when they miss me the most, they always stand quietly at the doorway, their black, gemstone-like eyes wide open, watching my sitting mother and me lying down. At this time, my mother always smiles and nods, so they tiptoe over to my bed, look at me without saying a word, and then go out again. Sometimes, when they see that my mother isn't in the room, they sneak in, and then they mostly bring me things. The most interesting thing was when my youngest brother once brought me a glass bottle filled with water and two tadpoles. At that time, my joy was hard to describe.</p>
<p>The worst thing about being sick is rainy days. On rainy days, not only is the air pressure very low, making you feel dull, but the sound of the rain also makes you feel lonely and sad. Naturally, sunny weather easily makes people with minor illnesses think of the scenery outside and feel restless. At the same time, the buzzing of wild bees on the window also makes your heart itch. But if you can change from lying down to sitting up and look at the gentle breeze and bright sunshine outside through the window, your heart will feel relaxed.</p>
<p>In addition, minor illnesses can make people think deeply. From flies to the universe, everything allows you to think slowly. At the same time, no one will disturb your train of thought. Many things that you think are unnecessary to think about when you're not sick often bring you reasons in your illness that are completely opposite to your intuitive understanding. (Minor illnesses can make people more accurate!) I often argue this way.</p>
<p>As for the fact that minor illnesses can keep you from doing many things you don't want to do and seeing many people you don't want to see, everyone knows that. For this point alone, minor illnesses are already worth your praise.</p>
<h3 id="e312">The Song of a Solitary Soul <a href="#e312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>— Autumn Moon</p>
<p>1.  The Journey of Life</p>
<p>If the journey of life is one of singing birds and fragrant flowers, then you, solitary soul! Your path is as desolate as walking through a desert.</p>
<p>People walk the long road of life with their loved ones, laughing and talking lightly: in spring, the murmuring swallows tell them stories of childhood; in summer, the cicadas on the fir trees sing love lullabies; and the white snow of winter adds whispered words of love by the fireside. The falling leaves of autumn make them cherish the fleeting years even more.</p>
<p>But you, solitary soul! Do you live through such seasons in cold isolation?</p>
<p>You are: in the desolate desert, your heart heavy as lead, you tread weary, heavy steps, walking alone. From summer to autumn, from winter to spring, what are you doing it all for?</p>
<p>You are: in this solitary journey, solitary soul! Do you believe you will find a vast oasis?</p>
<p>2.  The Eternal Traveler</p>
<p>Be an eternal traveler, go! Shoulder your baggage, carry a large umbrella, drag your heavy steps, wander along the indistinct horizon, to the distant end of the world:</p>
<p>Entrust your life to nature, let your days wear away on the journey. Bathe in the clear breeze and bright moon's dewy abundance in the evening, feast on the fragrant blooms of the four seasons in the morning. The owl guides you, the nightingale accompanies you, singing songs. – From now on, you move forward with steady steps, looking at the distant future, walking alone.</p>
<p>Then, you cherish the brightness of the autumn moon, whispering intimately to the horizon; you love the chirping of autumn insects, like the low, sobbing cries of a widow. – From now on, the cloudy mountain peaks, the distant and vast sky, will be your home, your eternal longing, your cherished childhood –</p>
<p>From now on, the days and hours pass leisurely, allowing your footsteps to traverse the ends of the earth: wandering east or west, south or north. The sound waves of your wild songs echo on the peaks of the Kunlun Mountains, your wandering chants have passed along the shores of the Mediterranean; let you gaze upon the majestic appearance of the pyramids, let you commemorate the past of Jerusalem:</p>
<p>Go! Shoulder your baggage, carry a large umbrella, be an eternal traveler.</p>
<p>Auntie: (Darling, what are you thinking about again?)</p>
<p>Rich man: (Yes, didn't you say how old I am this year!)</p>

<p>— Ji Yu</p>
<p>The squad leader stood up tiredly and stretched, squinting at the walls around the main room. Old Man Wang hurried forward:</p>
<p>—What do you need, Squad Leader?</p>
<p>—Where's my hat?</p>
<p>—Oh, the sun is very strong, please sit for a while longer. Old Man Wang politely tried to keep him.</p>
<p>—No, I can't, I still have official business to run! the squad leader said firmly.</p>
<p>Old Man Wang handed the squad leader's hat, oiled paper umbrella, and bundle to him, then took out three silver coins from the pocket of his blue cloth short-sleeved shirt and respectfully handed them to the squad leader:</p>
<p>—These are for Squad Leader, one dollar for your trouble, one dollar because I didn't buy any meat today... the rest is for not getting Squad Leader any cigarettes... it's not much, thank you for your trouble, I'm sorry...</p>
<p>The squad leader took the money, pretended to be serious for a moment, and then began to speak sternly:</p>
<p>—That's what you say, but tomorrow you come to the village and pay off the full amount... remember clearly, the full amount is ten dollars, the registration fee at the regiment is one dollar and fifty cents, and... this... this... well, that can be said later, a total of eleven dollars and fifty cents, remember? If you don't pay it off tomorrow, according to the rules, it's a fine of two dollars for each day, double the fine after three days, and you'll have to sit in the (dark room)... everyone knows their own business!</p>
<p>Old Man Wang didn't say anything, just nodded. The squad leader and the militiaman left together. Old Man Wang stood there blankly, as if he had lost his soul. After the bark of the yellow dog, there was the intermittent sound of the waterwheel and an unpleasant, dry cough.</p>

<p>The summer night breeze brought some coolness, seeping into the hearts of the farmers, which had been scorched by the flames of the day. They dragged their tired bodies and lay down on the bamboo mats spread under the eaves of their houses or in the courtyards, and fell asleep snoring.</p>
<p>At Old Man Wang's door, there was no mat, and no one was lying on the ground. His consumptive daughter-in-law had long since called Xiuying away. Old Man Wang squatted alone with his back to the (ancestral altar), his hands on his knees, staring blankly at the fence across the way, thinking about what had happened today and the eleven and a half dollars he had to go to the regiment with tomorrow. His son and grandson had been drafted away, were they still alive or dead now?</p>

<p>Recent Resurgence of Kidnappings and Extortion, All Parties Cooperating to Step Up Efforts to Eradicate</p>
<p>Not long ago, an oil tycoon living in Hollywood, named Gutheral, was kidnapped by kidnappers. This is a sign of the resurgence of kidnapping in Hollywood. The general stars are once again panic-stricken and uneasy. Even the calm Garbo, who has always relied on fierce dogs for protection, has now begun to hire several bodyguards. Many stars have once again been subjected to extortion by bandits. Among them, Ann Harding, Marlene Dietrich, Mae West, Bing Crosby, and Constance Bennett have received many threatening letters. Mae West was ordered by bandits not to testify in court because she had lost valuable jewelry, otherwise, she would be punished by (disfigurement). Many extortion incidents have been resolved quickly and privately, because many stars are afraid of trouble, and many are loose with money. Paying a few thousand dollars to ensure the safety of oneself or one's family is not worth arguing about.</p>
<p>However, according to the Hollywood police, there will be no more shocking kidnapping cases in the future. Because of the comprehensive defense and the concerted efforts of film companies and stars, Hollywood has become a place that kidnappers can only dream of. Gutheral was kidnapped, and the Hollywood police cracked the case in just six days. Gutheral was rescued without spending a penny. The kidnappers were arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Gutheral case is a touchstone for the Hollywood police authorities' capabilities and is also related to the fate of Hollywood's general movie stars. He lives at the foot of Beverly Hills, where the villas of stars are lined up one after another. They are also very familiar with this rich man. Therefore, since he was kidnapped, the villas of the general stars have been lined up one after another. They were waiting for the people from their own houses to come back. They thought, if the kidnappers were victorious, got a huge ransom, and got away with it, then who would be the next to be kidnapped? Whether the power of the kidnappers has grown to an unstoppable extent, and whether the Hollywood local authorities have the strength to protect the stars. Later, Gutheral actually returned safely without a scratch, and the whole of Hollywood was in an uproar. The stars all ran to Gutheral's house, shouting and celebrating, and the lawn in front of Gutheral's house immediately became a place for a public gathering. Los Angeles Prosecutor Fizer, Police Chief Davis, and Detective Chief Bisgailtz became temporary national heroes, cheered everywhere. Mr. Fizer also publicly gave a speech on the thoroughness of Hollywood's protection of the stars, advising the public not to worry. Now let us record the general outline of Fizer's speech below:</p>
<p>(This is certainly something that Hollywood should celebrate. Hollywood is where the stars gather, and it is also the place most coveted by bandits in the United States. They think that the general movie stars earn as much as five or six thousand dollars a week, so they must be able to afford the ransom. Moreover, the general kidnappers are undoubtedly admirers of the stars, so they don't need to spend money to buy off routes. There is also the point that when these stars are filming, they are suddenly kidnapped by bandits, and the film company is willing to pay a huge ransom to protect the lives of the stars, because the company has already spent a lot of money, and the film has already been half-shot. If the stars don't come out, the capital they have already put down will all be in vain. The above are all the reasons why bandits covet the general movie stars in Hollywood.)</p>
<p>However, according to Mr. Fizer's view, there are many difficulties in kidnapping stars. First, the stars are recognized by the public, and it is difficult to hide and transport them. The stars have very heavy workloads and social interactions, and people are constantly looking for them, so if they are kidnapped and disappear, someone will definitely discover and ask about it within ten or twenty minutes. Ordinary businessmen often disappear, and no one knows about it for several hours, which is different from the stars. Therefore, the kidnappers' methods must be quick and clean, and not a single second can be wasted. This requires an extremely complete organization and bandits with both courage and knowledge to engage in the kidnapping business in Hollywood. Moreover, the thoroughness of the Hollywood local authorities' protection of the general stars makes the general bandits feel a sense of despair. Now let us listen to Mr. Fizer's various arrangements to prevent the behavior of kidnappers. (To be continued) Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e315">Review of (Shadow of the Knife) <a href="#e315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Yue</p>
<p>Tomorrow At Seven - Showing at Grand Shanghai</p>
<p>(Shadow of the Knife), like most detective films, contains coincidence, fortuity, artificiality, far-fetchedness, and a lack of character development. It shares these common flaws with other films of the genre.</p>
<p>While (Shadow of the Knife) features the convoluted plot and unexpected resolution typical of detective films, the director's poor handling and the absence of an atmosphere of suspense and dread diminish the impact that even standard detective stories should achieve.</p>
<p>In "Tomorrow at Seven," the director could build suspense by employing various horror elements to heighten the audience's anticipation. At the climax of seven o'clock, the director could then deliver the thrills inherent in a detective story through meticulous planning.</p>
<p>However, the director of (Shadow of the Knife) has failed to capitalize on these elements effectively.</p>
<p>During the nascent era of Chinese cinema, detective films featuring inserted knives and left calling cards were not uncommon. However, such simplistic and shallow works have long been discarded by the times.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after several years, the American RKO Pictures has produced this juvenile narrative for the silver screen. The scriptwriter's shallowness and vapidity are therefore readily apparent.</p>
<p>This film will undoubtedly meet the same fate as Westerns, failing to resonate with audiences who are at the forefront of the times.</p>

<p>— Fu</p>
<p>This magazine has already reported on the unfortunate death of Dorothy Dell, but it was not detailed. Now I will add some details. Dorothy Dell was selected by Earl Carroll as one of the sixteen most beautiful women in the film industry. In fact, she can also be said to be the most beautiful person in Hollywood, because her figure is not only the best in Hollywood, but also probably unmatched anywhere in the world. At the age of fifteen, she won the title of (Miss America), and soon she was awarded the title of (Miss Universe). Before entering the film industry, she had already become famous in the Broadway musical scene. She had only been in Hollywood for half a year, and Paramount was already considering promoting her to a star. Unfortunately, a car accident occurred, and she and the driver of the car died tragically within a few hours. Her driver, Dr. Carl Wagner, was a doctor in Pasadena near Hollywood and a well-known figure in social circles. After the banquet in Pasadena ended, Wagner personally drove her back. Unexpectedly, at a turning point in the middle of the journey, Wagner lost control accidentally, and the car crashed into a utility pole. Dorothy died instantly, and Wagner also suffered a skull fracture and died six hours after being taken to the hospital. This happened on the night of June 7. Paramount all expressed regret for Dorothy Dell's death, because if she had not died so fast, she could have become a brilliant star by now.</p>

<h3 id="e317">The Origin of Strange Advertisements Amidst the Opening of (Song of the Fishermen) <a href="#e317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>— Willow Catkins</p>
<p>About two weeks ago, an advertisement for (Song of the Fishermen) was published in the film section of both the Shen and Xin newspapers. The few words were quite eye-catching. At the time, the Jincheng Theater suspected that it was sent by Lianhua, while Lianhua suspected that it was sent by Jincheng. Unexpectedly, when the two parties asked each other face to face the next day, it was not either of them. They then called the newspaper office to inquire. It was said that an unknown man brought the manuscript and cash to be published. The name and address were unknown even to the newspaper office. And he spent a lot of money, one advertisement cost 54 yuan and 40 cents. So this matter became a mystery. Recently, I accidentally discovered that the friend who sent the free advertisement was a Mr. Jin from Baodacanhang in Xian'gua Street in the South City. According to him, he likes to watch Lianhua films the most, and this (Song of the Fishermen) is even more to his taste. He has watched it as many as nine times. He and Jincheng and Lianhua can be said to have no relationship at all. This time, the sending of the advertisement was entirely driven by a love for (Song of the Fishermen), and there was no other purpose. Only then was this mystery broken. A movie fan like Mr. Jin can be considered enthusiastic.</p>

<p>(1) Ma-Xu Weibang, the screenwriter and director of (Stormy Petals), has announced that his second work will be (Heaven and Hell), but at the same time, he has also written another script. Both of these scripts have been sent to Beijing for registration. Which script will Ma-Xu actually film? He himself is still unwilling to say.</p>
<p>(2) Because Yang Xiaozhong and Liang Saizhen had a previous acquaintance, he invited Saizhen to guest star in the role of the fallen woman in (Vortex), which was vacated by Li Zhuozhu's return to Hong Kong. It is said that her performance in (Vortex) this time surpasses her previous works.</p>
<p>(3) Our little star, Li Keng, lives in Lianhua Film Studio No. 1. The two Western girls next door to Lianhua Film Studio No. 1, who are under the age of ten, are his very good friends. Because those two girls were born in Shanghai, they can also say a few words of Shanghai dialect. Sometimes when they talk to Li Keng, bystanders find it particularly interesting. That day, the two of them asked Li Keng for a photo, and Li Keng personally signed his name.</p>
<p>(4) Fei Mu has recently not only been directing his (Fragrant Snow Sea), but also editing the footage of his (Fragrant Snow Sea), so he is very busy. He once said to people: (I will definitely complete it all this month!)</p>
<p>(5) Such heroes, Han Langen and Liu Jiqun, after they finished filming (Lucky Star) that day, came to the branch management office for something. They once gave the people in the translation department a thumbs up and said: (In Lucky Star, Wang Moqiu really knows how to act!)</p>

<p>— By Caoshi</p>
<p>Eddie and Laurel were anxious to find a safe place to hide the string of pearls. The radio—the vase—everything seemed easily visible. But Eddie suddenly had an idea—Whilshire would never search a place he had already searched. So he lifted the lid of the coffee pot and put the long string of pearls inside. Soon after, when Whilshire walked back into the room, the first thing he saw was the coffee pot, and he immediately wanted to pour himself some coffee. Beads of sweat appeared on Laurel's forehead, and Eddie trembled, reaching out to grab it. But the coffee had already poured into the cup. Whilshire took a sip and thought it tasted like dishwater, so he didn't drink it. Whilshire then went back to the bedroom to continue his search. Shirley seized the opportunity to sneak into the dining room, take the pearls from the coffee pot, and hide behind Eddie, pulling on his clothes and saying, "(Don't trick me, Daddy—I found them again!)" Eddie was almost scared out of his mind. He snatched the pearls from her hand, tossed her a small silver dollar, and told her to go buy herself some ice cream. Shirley happily left. Whilshire was concentrating on searching the bedroom. Eddie knew he had to hide them immediately—Laurel saw a carpet beater and quickly opened it up, stuffing the pearls inside. Suddenly, a rude voice startled them again, it was Annie—the maid from the apartment—who wanted to borrow the carpet beater! Laurel and Eddie watched the carpet beater leave, feeling much relieved. Whilshire watched suspiciously, shaking his head. "It wouldn't be in there!" He glared at the two young people. "(Okay, I'll spare you today—but don't think I'm giving up!)"</p>
<p>After Whilshire left, they rushed to retrieve the carpet beater. But when they opened the carpet beater, there was only dust inside. Where had the pearls gone? At this time, Annie was also nowhere to be found; tonight was her day off. Eddie, Laurel, Kay, and Keene searched everywhere, but the pearls were not found.</p>
<p>Eddie was searching alone at home when he suddenly heard a faint "(Hands up)," and he stood up. It turned out to be Stone coming to get the pearls. Stone held a pistol, forcing Eddie back until he had nowhere to retreat, his back against the wall. Stone had now reached the center of the room. Eddie used his arm to press the mechanism on the wall that stored the bed inside the wall, and the bed immediately fell down, hitting Stone. Eddie quickly punched him unconscious. After tying Stone up with rope, he dragged him into the kitchen and rushed to find the police...</p>
<p>Shirley, looking for a cat, unintentionally found the pearls again in the trash can. She ran back in shock, shouting, "(Daddy—Daddy—I found them!)" But Daddy was nowhere to be found. And the person who gave her the pearls was lying in the kitchen, tied up with ropes. Shirley looked at him suspiciously. "(Um, mister, your pearls were gone, but I found them!)" Stone looked up and said, "(Great. You're a really smart good kid. But please untie my ropes.)" Shirley looked at him closely for a while. "(Are you playing a game?)" Stone tricked her, "(Your daddy tied me up so I couldn't peek?)" Shirley was still a bit hesitant. But she couldn't resist Stone's repeated coaxing. So she took a kitchen knife and cut the ropes for him.</p>
<p>Luckily, Eddie hadn't gone far. The police had received a warning that Stone had appeared nearby, and Frenegan led the police to surround the house. Kay and Beebe arrived a few seconds earlier. As soon as she got home, she heard the frantic shout, "(Help! Daddy! Let me go! Let me go!)" It was Shirley's voice. She rushed upstairs without regard for her own life. But by the time she got upstairs, Stone had already taken Shirley through the window onto the roof. Kay's exclamation drowned out the child's cries. (To be continued)</p>
