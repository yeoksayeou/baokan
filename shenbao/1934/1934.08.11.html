<h3>奥國復辟問題恒</h3>
<p>旬日以來。奥國復辟問題。又復甚囂塵上。奥國當局曾公然宣稱。奥國問題之解决。須於哈布斯堡皇室中求之。其準備復辟之意。顯然可見。至意大利對付此問題之態度據歐電所述。亦復有積極援助之意。而寓居比利士之沃度大公。亦秤然心動。躍躍欲試。且有訪問羅馬之傳說。就此三方觀察。則此奥國復辟之一問題。似已較陶爾斐斯時代更進一步矣。</p>
<p>此一問題之所以日趨熱閙。當爲德國之態度所促成。固不待言。然奥之復辟。能否遏阻德國之東進。則爲一絶大疑問。除靜觀未來事實之演化外。恐無人能爲之預斷也。吾人就歷史上事實立論。奥國復辟。若果成功。希特勒必受一大打擊。蓋奥之哈布斯堡皇室。於日耳曼民族中。威望素著。歷爲領袖。如十八世紀時。萊因東岸。日耳曼民族之王國公國。爲數無慮三百餘。奥爲其盟主。及爲拿破崙之鐵蹄蹂躪後。合爲三十八國。結成德意志同盟。奥仍爲盟主。唯至普奥戰後。其盟主地位。始告失墜。而哈布斯堡皇室在德意志之威望。亦爲普王室霍亨族倫所代。今奥意當局欲使哈布斯堡復辟之運動。似在利用哈布斯堡王室過去之威望。進行以奥爲中心之日耳曼民族分化運動。其可望合併於奥者。卽爲德國南部與奥相鄰之巴伐利亞等地。蓋此等地方之日耳曼人。皆屬天主敎徒。宗敎上與奥一致。若能併入奥國。實可削弱德國現有之辇力就希黨對於天主敎徒壓迫之情况觀之。哈布斯堡王室復辟一旦成功。德國南部之歸入奥國。未始無可能性也。再則哈布斯堡復辟之後。可有間接誘發德國復辟之作用。從而打銷希特勒在德之統治。三則哈布斯堡皇室歷史的傾向不主張德意志之統一。故復辟卽以保德奥之分立。就此三種作用觀察。則奥國復辟之後。確能予希特勒以不少之打擊。唯以目今在整個日耳曼民族要求大統一之願望十分强烈之秋。分化運動。能否如願以償。尚屬難言耳。</p>
<p>再則此問題之能否實現。固視奥意當局之努力如何。而其關鍵。更須視小恊約國之態度。蓋依照戰前制度。奥國皇室。不僅卽爲匈牙利之王室。同時又爲捷克全部南斯拉夫羅馬尼亞一部之統治者。今之奥國復辟。爲單純奥國之復辟。抑兼爲匈牙利之復辟。此爲一大有進出之問題。若其復辟而僅限於奥國。則勢力不大。對於小恊約之威脅。亦不大。設二國依戰前之辦法。共戴一主。而行復辟。則聲勢較盛。小恊約自不能無所恐懼矣。且哈布斯堡皇室。於復辟之前。對於小恊約處分奥匈土地之聖日耳曼和約與脫剌農和約。能否予以承認。關係尤爲重大。設事前不予承認。則復辟之後。自必以收復戰前失地爲職志。其足以危害捷克。羅馬尼亞。南斯拉夫。等新興國家之存在。不言而喻。故奥之復辟問題。必以哈布斯堡皇室承認上述二種和約爲先决條件。否則必遭小恊約之反對。隨而影響法國之態度。就最近之歐電以觀。法與小恊約對於此事。皆表反對。故意大利之態度。亦頓轉消極。於此可知此一問題雖已喧闐人耳。而能否成爲事實。蓋尚在不可知之數也。</p>

<h3>羅斯福白銀政策</h3>
<p>旨在稻固物價保護對外貿易</p>
<p>白銀國有大有助於調整元值</p>
<p>期達貨幣準備金三銀一比例</p>
<p>國外已引起美通貨膨脹恐慌</p>
<p>（華盛頓）財長摩甘索今日告新聞記者、解釋羅總統白銀國有之行政命令、謂政府此舉、不過行使其公用特收用權耳、證劵交易所方面謂政府欲積極進行購銀方案、藉以答覆通貨膨脹者之呼號、白銀派領袖湯姆士對此公布、甚爲歡迎、謂世界用金國可因此傾覆、而世界新幣制與新繁榮時代、亦將從此開始、美國旣决計多用銀幣、將使他國亦採此同樣政策、美政府現尚須收買白銀十萬萬盎斯、以符合國會所定之比率、此次命令、直宣告世界未有充分黃金以滿足通貨之需要、故不得不轉求于白銀、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>白銀國有之佈告</h3>
<p>羅總統白銀國有之佈告、謂美國政策、欲增多美國貨幣準備中銀對金之比例、以期達到貨幣準備金三銀一之最後目的、財部對於所發行之銀劵、將維持十足銀準備、銀劵及公私用途之合法通貨、可於請求兌現時、以標準美元兌換之、所有白銀、必須於九十天内送交鑄幣廠、惟内外銀幣銀塊·外國政府與外國中央銀行所有之現銀·及金屬合製用品中之銀、不在此例云、羅總統在其布告之序言中謂現在設法增高與穩固國内物價、及保護美國對外貿易、以抵制外幣跌價而發生的不利影響之必要云、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>美財長發表談話</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美國突然以每盎斯五角另另一毫之價格、將白銀收歸國有、已由羅斯福總統根據銀法第七條、於今晨下令實行、今晚全世界皆注意財部此後行動、各方已紛向財部詢問眞相、財長毛根韜迄無表示、故外人對於政府此舉是否有膨脹影響、祗能各自懸測、據財長向報界所發表之談話、有數點頗爲重要、卽</p>
<p>（一）銀法所定之白銀交易利益稅百分之五十、兹以白銀收歸國有、在繳解造幣廠時可免征收、</p>
<p>（二）生銀價格仍爲每盎斯六角四分五厘、</p>
<p>（三）新幣價格、將根據收歸國有後購進之價爲定、惟財部則將規定銀價爲每盎斯值美元一·二九二九、</p>
<p>（四）短期賣買及遠期交易之規程、將於數日内發表、</p>
<p>據稱此項計劃、數日前卽已完成、惟財長今晨忽然實行、財長於下令之</p>
<p>前曾以電話致格林灣向總統請示、當經核准、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>國會白銀派滿意</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）國會領袖今日皆贊成總統命令將白銀收歸國有、參衆議員在上屆議會中對於幣制問題活動者、皆稱此舉並非膨脹政策、民主黨參議員富勒起爲參院銀行及幣制委員會主席則稱、白銀收歸國有之後、通貨將稍爲膨脹、彼以爲此舉能使物價及證劵價格皆爲提高、參議員湯姆斯爲膨脹派領袖、更稱此舉係政府實行國會所定政策必經之途、湯氏謂總統此舉影響甚大、對於調整美國幣制政策及美元價值、皆有極大之助力云、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>美國哈末脫參議員波拉今日在此演說、主張由政府設立中央銀行、統制全國通貨、波拉在上屆國會開會之時、爲白銀派領袖、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>各方面解釋不一</h3>
<p>（紐約）羅斯福總統今日所發以每盎斯五角零零一價格收白銀爲國有之行政命令、此問各方面對之、解釋不一、白銀派以爲此舉可增進遠東之購買力、但其他方面則謂增加銀幣之購買力、將在東方諸國發生緊縮之影響、衆料美國白銀公開銀市將因此而暫停、此令發表後、今日賣風大起、金融界謂政府此舉、表示意欲更積極進行一九三四年白銀案所載之白銀政策、據一般意見、美財部暫將多購白銀、而世界銀價亦將高起、蓋外國市塲將起活動之買風也、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>能貨膨脹之準備</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統頒布命令、實行白銀法案、將白銀收歸國有、據政界所見、羅斯福此種决定、側重在心理上收效果、因實際白銀準備卽使因此增加、亦不致立時達到百分之二十五、但羅斯福以農業區域各議員多爲通貨膨脹派、均以美元尚未充分貶價、意欲將美元價格按照湯姆斯所提修改案、在法律上完爲五角、乃决意行使白銀案所法畀予之權力、俾通貨膨脹派得以部分滿意、但一般人相信羅斯福决不致立時入於通貨膨脹之途徑、此次命令不過試探形勢、其效果决不如若干通貨膨脹派所預料之大也云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦金融時報今日稱、羅斯福總統關於美元之意見現猶守秘密、但其白銀政策確爲將來通貨膨脹之準備、美總統白銀公布之日前最要影響、乃外人觀察家之以美國續有膨脹行動爲慮者、今史覺其所慮之不虚也云、每日郵報亦稱、美國此種政策、確爲一種膨脹、但其範圍並未達甚廣大或驚人之程度云、惟彚文報則謂倫敦操業者並不抱美國此項命令、乃膨脹新舉動的表徵之見解、（十日路透電）</p>
<h3>世界市塲起波動</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統收白銀爲國有之令、今日在全世界發生反響、而華盛頓官方則正默察其影響、官塲絡續接得倫敦·孟買·上海·及其他重要銀市震動之情報、俱不發表意見、倫敦電告中國方面大批抛出、竟超過倫敦向印度收購之數、故倫敦經紀人表示、美國如不援助市塲、則銀價有趨跌之勢、孟買方面波動甚大、買氣甚旺、銀價飛漲且有續漲之勢、倫敦交易所銀礦股票高漲六便士、紐約商人則認此爲無足輕重、並謂其膨脹勢力日内卽將泯滅云（十日國民電）</p>
<h3>購銀幾何非所知</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美財部近在世界市塲購入白銀幾何、非局外人所能知、據衆估計、約爲一萬萬盎斯、而財部從其他方面亦收得白銀約二千六百萬盎斯、今日財部人員聲稱、此項新命令、至少可使財部再購進四千五百萬盎斯云、（九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今晨倫敦銀市中人咸相顧而問曰、美國將在此購銀乎、當美國購銀之消息發表後、銀業中人多相欣慶、估計美國存銀自一萬萬至三萬萬盎司不等、惟無論如何、美國如欲實施其白銀程序、則須需十三萬萬盎司左右之白銀、故許多人以爲美國勢必在國外購銀、如是則銀價必漲、但銀業中人亦有謂美政府限國人在五十天内交出其存銀、故在十一月以前、美國未必大批購買也、羅總統定白銀國有之消息、未有直接影響、而間接之影響、則爲美元之瘦弱、金鑛股票之爲人歡迎、及物品價格之漲起、蓋恐白銀國有後、將有幣值抑價之舉也、一般人意見以爲最大之影響、厥爲通貨膨脹心理之奮發云、（十日路透社電）</p>
<h3>紐約銀交易停市</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）政府公佈此消息後物品市塲卽停止白銀期貨之買賣、鑄幣廠之銀價定爲五角○○一、將扣去鑄幣稅百分之六十一又二十五分之八、然後以銀劵或他種通貨給予銀主、此項命令、不適用於去年十二月二十一日以後國内出礦之白銀、蓋此項白銀仍可按照十二月二十一日美總統之佈告送交鑄幣廠也、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>法貨幣策不受動摇</h3>
<p>（巴黎）美國將白銀爲國有、法國官塲方面、并不表示驚異、一般人以爲此舉不致妨害金集團各國現行政策、因之法國金融政策及國際現行結賬辦法、均不致感受不便、緣白銀國有政策、未必卽使美國羅斯福總統壓低美元價格之又一步驟、又况法國存貯美國之白銀、爲數極微、則美國白銀國有政策、在法國不致發生影響、自可斷定云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美鑛業尚無利可圖</h3>
<p>芮諾美國尼發達州銀礦業中人表示意見、謂白銀國有、未能使尼發達銀業卽受良好影響、因所定之價格、較諸去年十二月所公布新出礦銀價爲低也、就目前所知、尼發達未存現銀、今日尼發達礦主聯合會秘書告路透訪員、謂羅總統之宣佈、已予銀礦聯合會以其所欲得之承認、尼發達礦主希望銀價每盎斯八角或在八角以上、蓋必有此價格、而後低算銀礦之開採始有利可圖也、目前此種銀礦已停止工作、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本不致受大影響</h3>
<p>（南京）津島大藏次官關於美國羅斯福總統所公布之白銀國有、談話如下、</p>
<p>白銀國有之目的、係提高白銀價值、並因通貨膨脹主義者所要望、進而爲通貨準備之故、又因最近經濟狀態不良及選舉議員之期已近等諸般情形、因此公布白銀國有、然於日本影響不大、惟美國若進行膨脹政策時、金之價值或將被逼降至極點、故其通貨制度之變遷、應注意之、（十日電通電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）英倫銀行鈔票發行處在八月八日止一週中、超過三萬九千二百萬鎊、此爲前所未有之最高紀錄、查此鈔票額發行之增多、乃假期需要所致、此可視爲英國民衆銷費力增高之明徵、倫敦泰晤士報今日稱、上述數字、乃英國事業復興之顯著反映云、（十日路透電）</p>

<p>格林灣羅斯福總統今日於巡視夏威夷歸途中、發表第一次重要演說、力謂政府决定進行現在之計劃、並稱於財政方面、政府正在施行其「金律」、受政府之保護者、不特房主無圈閉房産之危險、卽小資産階級之儲欵人及投資人、從此亦可高枕無憂矣、總統言至人民對新政漸次恢復信心時、卽引證農業計劃·國家復興行政處之實業計劃·及政府之救濟計劃、而認其足以恢復全國之信念及勇氣云、總統並謂取締損人利已之新政、仍當繼續進行、惟謂政府並不欲妨礙誠實之商業、亦無意挹彼注此、政府之唯一宗旨、在以合作行動增進財富、而爲國人共霑云云、（九日國民社電）</p>

<p>大角海相抨擊</p>
<h3>英美海軍主張</h3>
<p>反對比率主義</p>
<p>（南京）大角海相九日赴那須御用邸謁見日皇、報告海軍情形後、與岡田首相同車回車京、海相在車中關於軍縮問題談曰、岡田首相曾聲明反對比率主義、本人亦抱同樣意見、美國布拉脫提督以日本僅僅位於東洋之一岸、然美國在大西洋太平洋之間、且其海岸綫甚長之理由、主張比率主義、此種議論、在普通人可認爲有理、然由專家方面觀之、毫無實際現由、夫戰爭者、於兩國勢力會戰於一處而得决定、考慮此種各項塲合、决定國防力爲最緊要、英國亦因在海外領有殖民地、主張比率主義、但假使英國失其殖民地、然於最後一戰、如得勝利、則可奮回失地、故保護海外殖民地問題、可以海上警察達其目的、彼等主張比率主義、用意不過欲維持比他國較大之海軍勢力而已、最大軍備國犧牲最大軍備、始能達到軍縮會議之目的也、（十日日聯電）</p>

<p>日外部與軍部</p>
<h3>互爭對俾儡監督權</h3>
<p>（東京）關於統一强化駐滿機關問題、已由外務·陸軍·拓務·及關係各省行使折衝、漸次進展頗有具體化之趨勢、在陸軍方面之意向、以爲此次改正該項機關、應首先决定其根本原則、故其改革案之根本辦法大致如左、</p>
<p>一、現今駐滿機關之根源卽爲全權大使·軍司令官·關東長官、此項三位一體之制度、應改爲全權大使軍司令官之二位一體制度、廢除關東長官、「滿洲國」之現狀旣經根據日滿議定書、當以日滿兩國共同防衛確保治安爲第一義、則關東軍司令官應兼任全權大使、全權大使設於總理大臣直接監督之下、但關於純屬外交上之事務、仍應照舊承受外務大臣之監督、至於軍司令官、凡關於統帥軍令之條項及對於「滿洲國、之治安問題應承受陸軍大臣之監督、</p>
<p>但外務省方面之意見、對於軍司令官全權大使之二位一體制、卽關於軍司令官兼任全權大使、並不反對、唯對於監督權問題、則以爲全權大使仍應照舊置於外務大臣指揮監督之下、於是陸軍與外務雙方當局間、關於根本原則、其意見處於互相背馳之情形、然因此項二位一體制度而發生之改革案、倘以該原則行使决定時、尚屬容易解决、若對於上項問題、陸軍與外務各方固執已見、而於今後事務折衝上未能一致時、結局或由首相及外相陸相組織三相會議、當由實行對滿政策念及國家大局而行使决定、蓋此外實無他法也、又陸軍方而所主張全權大使置於總理大臣直接監督之下、其意見大致如左、</p>
<p>（一）「滿洲國」與日本之關係根據日滿議定書、實於國防外交上擁有不可分離之特種關係、同時對於産業開發及其他一切設施亦有不可分離之密接關係在、故爲兩國之共存共榮計、須與以絶大之援助、其與他國外交關係較之、當屬全然不同、（二）「滿洲國」之外交須同時考慮日本之外交方針、在全權大使執行之純粹外交事務、其範圍至爲狹小、及在開發産業·經濟·鐵道·及其他各種關係上、對於日本拓務·農林·商工·鐵道各省間之關係上、頗形密接、在此種種關係上、則將全權大使置於總理監督之下、而使之與日本關係民爲統一强化、其於「滿洲國」之發展與日對滿政策之實行上、均認爲適當且便也、</p>
<p>（三）至將全權大使改稱駐滿全權之件、蓋以今後「滿洲國」與列國發生外交關係時、認爲名稱不甚適當、故此次對於名稱上加以考慮、倘認爲適合、則請更改、否則仍請依照現行之全權大使之名稱、當亦無妨云、（十日日聯電）</p>
<p>英實業代表</p>
<h3>將赴僞國考察</h3>
<p>聲明係私人行動</p>
<p>（倫敦）英實業聯合會今日决議於最近之將來遣派實業代表團赴「滿洲國」考察一切、並查明英國實業界能否與當地實業界全作、以發展各項事業、該團且將赴日本作短遊、俾與日本工商業之代表團體作友好之接洽、該團將以勞合德銀行與商業聯合保險公司之董事巴恩璧勲爵·塞里格曼兄弟公司之董事塞里格曼爵士·銀行家數人·商部出口業·放欵處顧問委員會之委員一人·英國實業聯合會之理事洛格克·英國鋼鐵業聯合會代表畢高德組成之、按畢氏生於日本、（八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）政府方面今日對實業代表團赴「滿洲國」考察事宣稱、該團將得英政府種種合法援助、該團現定月底出發、調查開闢新市塲之形勢並聞該團已呈報政府、聲明此行純係商業性質之私人行動云、至於英人如以私債貸與「滿洲國」、是否與國聯通過之不承認政策相衝突、負責方面則稱、政府當然認此借欵不屬政治性質、惟財部此後有權决定此問題也、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國實業聯合會、决定不日派遣實業考察團、前往「滿洲國」、已誌前電、頃泰晤士報及晨郵報、均發表評論、泰晤士報謂、「實業界旣有此種舉動、可見渠等對於遠東有新市塲之可尋、並非不知、吾人預料考察團赴日遊歷之後、必能趁便考察中國各大商業中心、而與中國商界及金融界鉅子、取得友誼之聯絡也、考察團之主要任務、在考查英國商業·金融·在如何範圍之内、能援助「滿洲國」之發展、在現在情形之下、英國銀行與日本人合作、確有種種利益、英日兩國實業家如能和衷共濟、則其良好影響、將不僅以「滿洲國」爲限、謂遠東全部將受其惠、亦不爲過也、」晨郵報亦有同一意見、其言曰「「滿洲國」物産豐富、其經濟發展必甚迅速、英國考察團此行、必受「滿洲國」皇帝及其政府之歡迎、果能如此、實雙方之利也、且考察團將由滿洲東赴日本、可見吾國人士、對於外間所稱日本加於英國商務之威脅、不甚措意、而轉認英日交好爲英國在遠東之最大利益矣、英日兩國、對於共同問題、如能採取共同解决方法、則兩國友誼、將益臻鞏固、考察團本此精神前往遠東、將來在政治上及經濟上之收獲、必於兩國均有裨益也」云云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>此外又談及各種情形、由是以觀、該東路之買賣交涉直至最後尚屬一進一退之形勢、倘蘇聯長此抱其强硬態度、則該項談判或竟至破裂、亦未可知、其前途頗形暗淡云、（十日日聯電）</p>

<p>華東社云、美政府當局宣佈白銀收歸國有、全世界之金銀市塲、因此劇烈變動、我國爲用銀國家、對此問題自有切身利害、華東社記者、爰於昨日、往訪銀行公會秘書長林康侯氏、據林氏對於此事之觀察、謂美之收歸白銀爲國有、與我有何利害、一時尚難推測、惟一般人以爲此舉將使黃金步跌、白銀飛漲、而我國大量白銀、勢將流出、此則不致成爲事實、良以最近我國白銀之出超、並非由於銀價之高漲、其眞實原因、純因年來外貨之入超、蓋外貨旣經大量入超、我國商人、在揭算貨價時、我國之輸出物旣不能與之相低、則以白銀償付貨價、自不可免、故我國白銀之流出、在此情勢之下、殊難阻遏、而根本挽救之方、端賴國貨之力自振作、使入超者易爲出超、則國内白銀、自可不致流出矣云、</p>

<p>歐亞公司</p>
<h3>新購巨型飛機</h3>
<p>月底卽可運滬</p>
<p>新新社云歐亞航空公司爲謀平粤航綫乘客之舒適及航程之縮短起見、特於本年四月中旬、向德國購訂榮格賜Ｊ·Ｕ·五二號式全金屬巨型飛機、以資應用、昨據該公司總經理李景樅氏語新新社記者、該新機將於本月底運到、及該機之優點頗詳、兹分誌如次、</p>
<h3>月底運到</h3>
<p>李氏首稱、本公司向德訂購之榮格賜Ｊ·Ｕ·五二號式巨型飛機、計有雙發動機三座、能載重三千五百公斤、可載乘客三十名、由北平至廣州、祇須八小時卽可到達、中國使用該種飛機、尚屬第一次、近接德方電告、該新機業已起運來華、本月底卽可抵埠、屆時將運往虹橋機塲配裝後、擬撥歸平粤直達航綫應用、俾縮短飛行時間、以利乘客、</p>
<h3>機翼優點</h3>
<p>該巨型機、機翼之優點、謂榮格式之補助機翼、係裝於機翼之後方、其長與機翼等、於風靜之時、雖裝滿三千五百公斤載重、亦只須在地面開行二百七十公尺、卽可上昇、上昇後、在空中飛行之速度、可因借助此項補助機翼之使用、每小時加至二百六十公里乃至三百公里、而降落之時、亦可將飛機之飛行速度、减低至每小時僅有六十五公里、故雖裝滿三千五百公斤載量之Ｊ·Ｕ·五二式飛機、於機輪着地之後、祇須在地面續行一百八十公尺、卽可完全停輪云、</p>
<p>銀行界表示</p>
<h3>儲蓄保證有困難</h3>
<p>新聲社云、自儲蓄銀行法公布後、本市銀行業、均認爲法中條文、多有窒碍難行之處、經一再開會議决、呈請修改、惟財政部則已根據該法第九條上半節之規定、訓令各銀行、將相當於儲蓄存欵結存總額四分之一之政府公債庫劵、按照市價核實計算、卽日交存中央銀行、以爲儲户保證、又由銀行公會呈請從緩實行、當經財政部批復不准、兹又據銀行界對新聲社所發表之意見如下、</p>
<p>第九條原文查儲蓄銀行法第九條、規定、「儲蓄銀行、至少應有儲蓄存欵總額四分之一相當之政府公債庫劵、及其他担保確實之資産、交存中央銀行特設之保管庫、爲償還儲蓄存欵之担保」、但上次部令、僅令各銀行交存四分之一相當之公債庫劵、而不及「其他担保確實之資産」、銀行界之意見、以爲法令施行、應整個有效、故此次部批、始有其担保確實之資産、種類數目、應隨時由部核定、各銀行依照辦理云云、現財政部旣尚未對核定足供担保之確實資産種類數目、則自難先行責令繳足四分之一之債劵、社記者、發表意見、認爲該條規定、確有爲難之處、公會方面尚須繼續請求緩行、致使影響及於公債市塲也、</p>
<p>照市價核計財政部原令、以公債庫劵價格、必須按照市價核實計算、但公債庫劵、旣爲國家發行、以國家稅收爲担保、則其認定之價格、應照票面除去已發還本息計算、不當照市價核計、因如照市價核計、是不啻政府對於國家債劵、估低其價值、在法理上似不可通云云、</p>
<p>粤徵國貨入口稅</p>
<h3>不啻變相恢復厘金</h3>
<p>新聲社云、廣州工商業、藉口上海工廠、每多外人投資、來粤傾銷爲詞、要求該省當局、凡外省入粤各貨、不分中外、一律實行抽稅、粤當局已准如所請、設局徵稅、全國各工廠、聞訊之下、反感甚烈、記者特於昨日走訪中華全國工業總聯合會常務理事胡西園氏、、叩其意見、胡氏謂、此次粤當局擬徵各省國貨入口稅、不惟各省貨物將來銷粤呆滯、卽粤省本身、因此産銷失其調劑、物價必至騰貴、生活提高、且此種排擠外省貨物入口辦法、影響所及、無形中造成各省精神上之分裂、於民族前途、爲害至烈、况各省無論機製品及士産、各有其天然性、一省中之需要品、亦决無包羅萬象、而不須外求者、例如北方之毛氈、廣東之拷綢、各有共天然性及專門術、非外省所能競爭、倘以粤省徵收外省貨物入口稅、而各省起而倣行、是不啻將七十餘年之釐金秕政變相恢復、流弊不堪設想、幸本市市商會市民提倡國貨會及本會等、對於此事、先後致電粤當局、剴切陳詞、請卽取消、中華全國工業總聯合會·亦將致電粤省、想粤省不乏明達、或能容納公意、改善辦法云、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>續「翻譯本的錯誤和疑難」（三續）</h3>
<p>丨答杜洛基君丨</p>
<p>答，即是說：「不在抽象的思維中充實以實際的内容，却把一切實際的内面都發散（抛棄）了，只剩下抽象的思維。」</p>
<p>問，二五七頁項目上有「一定過程中各種發展階段上的質的差異」這句話是不是根本的質是不會差異的，而非本質的質（即所謂第二次的質）的差異。例如書舉出蘇聯的四個時期，由戰時共産時代到現在的社會主義時代，那想必是根本的質的發展吧，正如資本主義的三個時期一般的發展而不敢變根本的質一樣的吧，然何以書上（二五七頁三行）又說：「各個階段又各自具有相異的質，」那末究竟每一發展階段的質的根本相異了呢，還是不過質的特殊性的發展？</p>
<p>答，所謂「根本的」是一個相對的名詞，資本主義的各階段的質，對於資本主義的整個過程說來，是「第二次的質，」但對於各階段自身說來，就是根本的第一次的質，當我們以整個資本主義的發展爲研究的主題時，我們說這各段階是因着一種「第二次的質而互有區别，當我們以各階段的區别爲研究的主題時，我們說各段階在根本的特質上各有差異，這是事物自身的矛盾之一，不能理解這矛盾，一定要嚴分「根本的」與「第二次的」，結果就會陷入形而上學的錯誤。</p>
<p>問，「都不爲蘇維堆經濟不能成就在資本主義經濟以上的發展速度，」這句裹的「爲」字是不是「以」的錯誤，如不是，那末請爲解釋。</p>
<p>答「爲」字並没有錯。「爲」字上面的「不」字却排錯了，應改爲「以」字。</p>
<p>問，「……由一發展階段到他發展階段的轉變，是「個飛躍。一例如資本主義的商業資本時代到産業資本的階段轉變，亦須革命的否</p>
<p>答，革命是舊生産關係或階級關係的倒壞，資本主義的各段階雖然有飛躍，也放犧牲（如小生産被大生産打倒等），但不是革命。</p>
<p>問，「本質在單獨的現象中，並不完全的表現出來。因而現象比較牠當中所表現的本質，更爲豐富而完全。不了解。</p>
<p>答，一牠就是指「現象」，本質不是由單獨一種現象表現出來，而是由多種多樣的現象表現的，本質只有一個，而現象的表現則有多種，故現象比本質更多隊、市即是更寶富，更完全。（完）</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>談歐化</h3>
<p>— 黃懷白</p>
<p>當現在世界人類天天接觸的時候，有一部份中國人，提到歐化，還覺得非常的憎惡和鄙視。這理由也很簡單，因所謂「歐化」，是和我們原有的東西「兩樣」的。惟其如此，在封建意識和復古運動支配下的某羣中國人，見了這和我們「兩樣」的東西，總是不大順眼。因爲不砃眼，所以更起了一種嫉視和反對的心理，這也是當然的。至於歐化本身的好壞，那是另一問題，反對歐化的人，除掉以嘲笑的態度放幾支冷箭外，是從没有人對於「歐化」眞正的價值，來忠實的加以估定。這種人反對歐化，與三十年前的義和團，依然是同一心理，祇是程度上的差别罷了。還有一種人，覺得歐化的東西，雖比較的合理化，現代化，好是好的；不過我們究竟是黃帝子孫，國粹却不能不保存，先王之道，更不能不衛。譬如以前國學大師王壬秋先生，看見了洋鬼子的火輪洋砲，同我們自已的帆船土砲比較，未免相形見拙。然而王先生爲着要保存國粹，却發出下面一段妙論來：</p>
<p>「火輪者，至拙之船也。洋砲者，至蠢之物也。船以輕捷爲能，械以巧便爲利。今夷船煤火未發，則莫能使行；砲須人運，而重不可舉。若敢决之士，奄忽臨之，驟失所恃，束手待死而已。」陳夷務疏</p>
<p>現在像這樣反對歐化的論調，還依然可以聽得到的。</p>
<p>然而，事實終究是事實，中國的一切，是太「古老」了。在目前世界上，長此「古老」下去是不行的。然則將如之何？無疑的，是需要新的生命來給牠脫胎換骨。這所謂新的生命，我敢大胆的說一句：就是在我們可能範圍以内，儘量的「歐化」。</p>
<p>歐化的基本精神是什麽？這在前人已經給了我們各種的解釋。譬如「五四」時代一般人所提倡的賽先生（Ｓcience）和德先生（Ｄemocracy），便是關於「歐化」較好的解釋。不過據我個人的觀察，却以爲歐化的基本精神是「前進」的。換句話說：歐化就是現代化，反對歐化的，就無異迷戀着骸骨，來和現代化的一切挑戰。假定我所觀察的不怎樣錯誤，而中國的各方面，又不能由現代回到義皇上世，那末，將往何處去呢？無疑的，祇有一條路！歐化。在中國全部文化史上佔有一角位置的文學，當然也不能例外的。</p>
<p>談到文學的歐化，反對者所藉口的，以爲文學是以語言文字爲基本條件的。中國自有牠的獨立的語言和文字，缺乏這歐化的基本條件，而猶侈談文學的歐化，其結果必然的成爲一種非驢非馬的文學。這種論調，似有而實非的。因爲主張文學的歐化，是要在這暮氣沈沈的中國文學裏，帶些西洋的作風和現代的情調。具體地說來：是要把九尾龜，留東外史這類低級趣味的作品，一變而爲小仲馬的茶花女。把七俠五義和荒江女俠的作品，一變而爲西萬提斯的吉訶德。把花園贈金私訂終身的彈詞，一變而爲易卜生的傀儡家庭。把揷科打諢一類淺薄的滑稽，改爲蕭伯訥式的幽默。把描寫社會黑暗方面像ＸＸ黑幕大觀一類的作品，一變而爲辛克萊的屠塲和煤王。把情書指南一類的作品，一變而爲盧騷的新愛綠綺思（ＴheNewHeloise）。這就是歐化的意義。總括的說：中國的文學，很像一座年久失修的廟宇，裏面是梁歪柱朽不成樣了。所以當這暴風雨的前夕，是需要新的材料和新的建築方法來一變舊觀，使牠成爲一座更莊嚴燦爛的建築物。我們主張文學的歐化，其目的就在此。</p>
<p>末了，爲免除一般人的誤解，得聲明一下：「歐化」是與「奴化」不同的。上海灘上的高等華人，常常瞧不起中國人，和一般新進的鍍金博士，不大愛說中國話，這些人走到三家村裏，洋裝革履，對着油條大餅不得到手的人們、大喫其巧克力，同愛人華爾兹Ｗallz起來，反嫌鄕村裏的地板，没有都市裏的來得光滑。於是不禁喟然曰：「中國是太落伍了！不可救藥了！」像這一類的人，可以說是「奴化」。我們所謂「歐化」，是和這絶對不同的。所以我們在積極方面，要提倡「歐化」，在消極方面，是要譁防「奴化」的。</p>
<h3>邊地夜記（下）</h3>
<p>— 吴巖</p>
<p>保商隊的弟兄，鼓大眼睛，作出拖人的姿勢。</p>
<p>「好，好，好，我們的隊長，正要拿你這個土匪！」</p>
<p>留鬍子的男子，更加氣洶洶地直朝外面碰。</p>
<p>「你嚇哪個？嚇哪個？就是Ｘ督軍的公館，我也進去過，他的太太還是！！」</p>
<p>「什麽　軍不督軍，管不到那麽多！你的眼睛瞎了嗎？看看呀，這裏是我們的天下！」</p>
<p>保商隊的弟兄將槍放在背上揹着，也特别加快足步，打斷鬍子的話，高聲嚷着出去了。老婆子依在門口，急得哭了起來。</p>
<p>「呵呀，兵爺爺饒了我們吧。……老師，老師，算了哪，算了哪！」</p>
<p>「你不要怕！你不要怕！什麽大官我也都見見過了！」</p>
<p>在門外的黑暗中，送回來這樣有生氣的聲音，似乎老婆子的臉上都現出了相信的神氣，但我却爲之不安，替鬍子胆怯起來。因爲隊長的脾氣，一路上我是看得很清楚的。記得在一處山裏人家息氣，小弟兄些攻下旱地，將人家一地的包榖，掠取一大半，投在火堆中，燒來打尖。老太婆和媳婦和孫兒便一齊跑來，跪在隊長的面前喊寃，要求賠償。隊長一面喝着瓶子裏的酒，吃着乾牛肉，一面張着醉紅了的眼睛，亂駡起來。</p>
<p>「一點包榖算什麽？哼，你們只合給土匪來搶的，滾開吧！」</p>
<p>老婆子看見我在沉思，便問我道：</p>
<p>「客人，你是看見過隊長的，他該不會打我們的老師吧！」</p>
<p>我不願意使她受着驚恐，便說着隊長也是很公平的，隨卽談到他的老師身上來了。因爲她這麽年紀在的老人家，還有如此奇怪的老師，是很使我感到詫異的。她略略理一理她那花白的頭髮，才慢慢地說道：</p>
<p>「唉，甚麽事都要老師的，没有老師指點，就是向那條路上走也算是瞎碰的。這，我哪裏懂得呢？後來，王婆婆告訴我，張大媽，你這樣怎行呢？吃一輩子的長素，敬一輩子的菩薩，也是白白的呀。你得拜個老師來，敎敎你哪。……呵，客人你餓了吧！我只顧說話了，你自家到廚下煮去飯吧！」</p>
<p>我說：</p>
<p>「讓我息一息，待會兒再去煮。」</p>
<p>她自已取出一小籃四季豆來，微微偏着她的頭，一面撕着四季豆的筋，一面繼續說下去。</p>
<p>「我想想，她老人家的話眞對呀，先前我兩個兒子爲什麽會死在火綫上？就是菩薩不曉得我在行善哪，行的善也不算數哩！……哪，你坐坐吧，我自家撕就够了，你不要帮我。……現在拜老師，多花一點錢，我也心甘願意！……」</p>
<p>說到最後的時候。嘴唇上便浮出愉悅的微笑，同時眼睛朝着紙畫的觀音像，又揚一揚高興的眼色。</p>
<p>我這時才漸漸明白那位鬍子，大概是什麽善堂一類的齊公，出來四鄕傳道設敎的，便隨口問道：</p>
<p>「老媽媽，拜老師要花多少錢呢？」</p>
<p>「呃，這個我不能告訴别人的！」</p>
<p>老婆子很嚴肅地低下了頭忽然發現了一根有蟲的四季豆。</p>
<p>「呀，你看，外面看着還是好好的呀，……人也是這樣的！」</p>
<p>摇摇她的頭，馬上舉起一張憂鬱的臉，睜着乞求似的眼睛，又朝壁上的神像望去。我却仍舊追問下去。</p>
<p>「爲什麽不能告訴人呢？」</p>
<p>她稍稍現出爲難的樣子，尖起手指來搔一會腦袋，才說道：</p>
<p>「老師說，世上的人是靠不住的，什麽話都不能向他們講。…」</p>
<p>剛好這時，鬍子回來了，帶着滿臉得意的喜色，把一塊磚一樣的東西，扔在桌子上面。老婆子連忙抓在手裏，喜得像得了寶貝那麽似的喊了一聲：</p>
<p>「呀！依還拿回來了麽？」</p>
<p>我便好奇地問道：</p>
<p>「這是什麽呀！」</p>
<p>「喂，還不知道嗎？這是鹽哪。」</p>
<p>鬍子回答着，同時像忍不住快樂那麽似的說道：</p>
<p>「嚇，什麽隊長，眞是！一進去，他很威風　，簡直要吃人了。哪知道我一提起胡師長張師長，他就一下子變了臉了，哈哈，今晚上眞有趣味！」</p>
<p>老婆子也歡喜得氣喘喘地說道：</p>
<p>「今晚實在是菩薩有眼睛哪！」</p>
<p>「是的呀，全靠諸神在上！」</p>
<p>鬍子接着嘴，立刻把手拱在胸前，腦袋仰起，嘴裏發出喃喃不清的聲音，彷彿在唸咒一樣。隨卽呌老婆子到觀音像前去跪着喊道：</p>
<p>一一叩首……再叩首……三叩首……」</p>
<p>一面獻着香。屋外面是靜靜的一夜，只在稍遠處有着馬嘶的聲音。（完）</p>
<h3>淄博印象</h3>
<p>— 羅三</p>
<p>（八）到山頭去</p>
<p>爲着採取陶器的標本，曾請了當地民敎館的張君做我底嚮導，作山頭之行。</p>
<p>山頭，距博山城五六里，是博山産瓷的中心。（據說此外，福山，西河，八陡，窰廣，北嶺，務店，兀子等處也是産瓷的區域，不過不及山頭規模來得大。）那兒最盛的時候，業瓷的有二百多家，仰仗瓷業爲生的有二三萬人！如今却已衰敗不堪了！</p>
<p>我們沿着孝婦河行，在靈泉寺邊登上運煤的小火車，行走在輕便鐵道的上面。一路上嶺蕩地前進！說起這條輕便鐵道來也頗有趣，本是幾個私人承築的，由八陡直達張博車站，可以運輸博東及其他公司的煤，到大火車站。（目下有賣給膠濟鐵路委員會之說）車比普通火車小到一倍，比築馬路用的輕便鐵道却又大的多！不過别看他樣子小，每日運煤收入倒有一千元。並且工人在各站賣客票，幾個大子兒或二三毛錢便可行二三十里的「順便路」！這項收入算是工人的利潤，不與鐵路當局相關！然而小火車的車箱，搭頭處是没有閂鎖，只是鐵鈎，鐵環，所以有時下山之際，慣力把後邊車箱向前引，就有脫環的危險，覆車也就成了家常便飯！所以我們登在上想：「上了車，我們的性命就交給了鐵環，直到下車爲止！」</p>
<p>所幸我們到山頭只有兩小站，性命可以安全的下車。</p>
<p>到了山頭，便看到窰廠烟囱林立！我們到一家作房裏去看了一週，向他們討了些瓷土，坯土，軸等原料，還有便是做好的坯子與實物。</p>
<p>他們所做的是碗，茶壺、盤子，花瓶等等，但都是粗件頭，比江西貨及西洋貨還差得多！</p>
<p>他們的打坯，上袖，繪花，純粹是手工，未曾假手於新式機器！據說從前這些磁器大宗地暢銷於東北，東北人常以山頭磁器作賠奩，自從東北失守以後，營業便一落千丈了！存在的窰户從二百家减至五六十家！從前山頭是出名的工人區，大菜館有十幾家，如今一家也没有。繪瓷器花圖的工人，以前孩子們每日可得一元，成人可得兩三元：如今完了！工資旣賤用人又不多！失業問題就緊壓在博山人的頭上！</p>
<p>在博山，我們可以看出中國小手工業的没落，與社會制度的不良了！無疑地國際資本主義的勢力，壓倒，中國人的一切生活！中國人還有挣扎的能力嗎？在回來的煤車上我這樣地嘆息。</p>
<h3>老人（一）</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>掛了「阿克索衣諾夫舊物八雜」這樣招牌的那家買賣，是擠在排滿了這一類商家的那條街上。横在屋上的金字招牌，已經失去了那點金花花的顔色，就是那以泥土築成的字的筆畫，有的也爲積年累月的雨水冲毁了，容易爲人讀成「阿克索衣奥夫舊物八雜」，或是「阿阿克斯衣諾夫舊物八雜」。可是這種錯認只是一些生客，因爲這個舖子在這條街上已經有了三十年。</p>
<p>在這個舖子的右面是一家下等飯館，標明了出賣二毛五一份的「家鄕午飯」，（事實上到邢裏的客人多半是討飯的人，花上五分錢買一個湯，把討來的乾麵包浸在湯裏喫着）；在左面，則又是一個舊仕物舖子。這條街是髒的，在夏天飛着成羣的蒼蠅，因爲是那麽多，嗡嗡的聲音都會使人的頭發昏；可是到了冬天，一層冰一層雪地蓋下去，不只把一切不潔之物都掩藏任裏面，顯着頗清爽的樣子；而且那自從造起來就没有翻修過的不平的路，也像是光滑了。但是這光滑並不對於行人有利，反倒更容易使人在那上面傾跌下去。</p>
<p>這一天，是一月十五日的晚間，那些没有國籍的白俄人民剛剛在頭一天度過了他們的新年。每個年節的日子，更容易使他們想記來過去的一切事情，因爲事實上是不會再有了，所以他們更覺着值得追戀。</p>

<p>敎育消息本年度私立專科以上學校</p>
<h3>補助費案核定經過</h3>
<p>國庫每月撥欵六萬</p>
<p>計全年七十二萬元</p>
<p>共計核定者卅二校</p>
<p>自本年度起由國庫撥給私立專科以上學校補助費每年七十二萬元案關係發展高等敎育甚巨、各方頗爲重視、本年度此項補助費之支配、雖尚未正式公布、但已完全决定、頃記者對敎育部辦理此案經過各情事、特詳加探詢、所得消息如次、</p>
<p>本年三月間、敎育部爲奬助成績優良、而經費困難之私立專科以上學校起見、曾向行政院提議自二十三年度起、由國庫每月撥欵六萬元、計全年七十二萬元、定爲私立專科以上學校補助費額、申明補助時注重實科、其費額不得少於百分之七十、補助項目爲設備費與敎席費、當經行政院曁中央政治會議先後通過、中央政治會議並提示核給標凖寛嚴須注意該地方敎育發達程度、務求普遍全國、無使偏重方隅等三要點、經敎育部製定私立專科以上學校補助費分配辦法大綱、呈奉行政院、中央政治會議核准備案後、即通令全國私立專科以上各校、凡本年度欲申請補助者、應照補助費分配辦法大綱之規定、在六月底以前、將申請書送部、計申請補助者四十一校、同時依照辦法大綱組織審查委員會之規定、聘定部外而與私立大學無關係之專家委員及指派部内委員七人、自七月二十三日起舉行審查委員會會議一星期、審查委員會辦理此事、頗爲愼重首先議定審查標凖爲、（一）補助以成績優良而經費困難者爲限、（以視察報告爲主要根據）（二）其請求補助之學科設備應已有相當基礎、經補助後能希望其確有成績表現者、（三）暫准立案之學校、以不補助爲願曥、（四）凡敎育部認爲某項特殊課目因國家政策或地方適宜關係、應在某處學校辦理者、得變更其原有請求、而與以該項特殊課目之補助、（五）凡建築及經常費用、概不補助、（六）凡予學校補助、應兼顧其地域之分配等八項、</p>
<p>審查標凖决定該根據該項標凖、分爲核定補助項目與核定補助數額兩種步驟、從事嚴密審查、議决補助費總額七十二萬元中、除酌列五萬元請敎部保留備作本年度私立專科以上、各校臨時緊急救濟費外共計核定補助者三十二校、各校補助數額如次、</p>
<p>（一）金陵大學三萬元（二）金陵女子文理學院一萬二千元（三）東吳大學一萬元（四）南通學院三萬五千元（五）大同大學三萬五千元（六）復旦大學一萬五千元（七）光華大學一萬五千元（八）大夏大學一萬五千元（九）滬江大學二萬元（十）中法大學藥學專修科一萬元（十一）東亞體育專科學校五千元（十二）蘇州美術專科學校六千元（十三）之江文理學院八千元（十四）厦門大學九萬元（十五）福建恊和學院一萬二千元（十六）華南女子文理學院八千元（十七）嶺南大學三萬五千元（十八）廣州大學六千元（十九）廣東國民大學一萬四千元（廿）廣東光華醫學院八千元（廿一）華西恊合大學二萬元（廿二）湘雅醫學院三萬五千元（廿三）武昌中華大學八千元（廿四）武昌華中大學一萬五千元（廿五）武昌文華閣圖書館專科學校五千元（廿六）焦作工學院三萬五千元（廿七）山西川至醫學專科學校一萬五千元（廿八）燕京大學六萬元（廿九）輔仁大學一萬元（三十）朝陽學院八千元（卅一）南開大學四萬元（卅二）齊魯大學三萬元、</p>
<p>以上各校補助費額、厦門大學及燕京大學兩校經濟情形特殊、補助較多、南開大學經審查委員會議定、該校雖已另受國庫之補助、此次似可不必再予考慮、但因該校成績素優、並已從事應用科學及實際問題之研究、故特予該項事業以補助、藉資奬勵、又有少數學校、雖辦理成績較遜、未能全與分配辦法大綱所定條件相合、但該委員會爲給予該少數學校以努力向上之機會起見、亦予核給補助、此外又有若干學校、因顧及所在地域關係、其補助費額、特予寛優核定、綜計審議結果准給補助之三十二校中、以科别言、則理農工醫等科佔百分之八○·七、文法商敎育等科佔百分之一九·三、以費别言、則設備費佔百分之八一·五、敎席費佔百分五一八·五、</p>
<p>敎育部據審查委員會報告審議結果後、認爲核定之各校袖助數額、尚屬妥當、即將審查委員會所擬原案、呈報行政院請予備案、並請轉呈國府備案公布、聞此案已於日昨經行政院會議議决照准備案、惟公布時期、尚須照章待國府備案後云、</p>

<h3>具業餘式的播音機</h3>
<p>— 頴夫</p>
<p>（波長四十至一百公尺）</p>
<p>這一具播音機，製造簡單，各零件又都是收音機之所常用的，天綫一方面，也不需要特别裝置、有興趣想播音的朋友，不妨試一下。不過在寶騐的時候，所用的波長，祇可在四十至一百公尺以内，要二百，三百，六百，而至一千公尺的波長，當然也可以，這祇要將那些綫圈的圈數增加就可以，不過這些波長，是留給做廣播用的，倘若業餘家們，要用百五十尺以上的波長的話，那麽全二十五公里以内的收音，就會給你擾的一塌糊塗了。要是給交通部查出來，少不免就要吃一塲官司。所以要試騐，最好是在四十至一百公尺以内，况且這種波長、還可發射遥遠。我曾用這具機來通話、竟達到一百五十公里的距離，用來通報，更能遠達數倍。那時我用的兩只燈泡，都是飛利浦Ｂ四○五號。</p>
<p>三個綫圈，可用二十號雙紗包綫，在三寸直徑的膠管上，先繞Ｌl四圈，然後約離開半英寸，再繞四圈做Ｌ２，不要弄斷，連續着抽一綫頭，約隔離四分之一英寸，復澆四圈做Ｌ３</p>
<p>在地綫回路處，串接一只安培表（Ｏ－１Ａ５），或小電珠，來看看振盪的情形。</p>
<p>高週率阻流綫圈，用三十號雙沙包綫，在直徑半英寸，長三英寸的圓木柱上，約繞一百圈。</p>
<p>倘若所用的波長，是六十至一百公尺，那麽以上的四個綫圈的圈數，都得加百分之五十便行。</p>
<p>Ｔ是調幅變壓器，比例數爲一比十，至一比四十。停用的時候，就用那開關Ｓ來短路那話筒的電源，這乾電池是四至九弗打。</p>
<p>ＡＦＣ是三十亨利的低週率阻流綫圈，可購買現成的。</p>
<p>要發電報時，可把電鑰揷在Ｘ處。這具發射機代價廉，重量輕，可裝在一個箱子裏做旅行播音機用。（完）</p>
<h3>利用超短波作近距離通話</h3>
<p>— 劉同康</p>
<p>假期委實給予我不少的便利，天雖熱得使人汗流夾背，終於阻礙不了我的好動心。</p>
<p>最近兩星期以來，作者從事於試騐利用超短波作近距離的通話，結果，成績堪稱滿意，現在且將試騐經過情形，略草於後，以資同志們參考。</p>
<p>本來，利用超短波試騐，是我們久久渴望的了！終究，努力的結果，希望的種子，形成了現實的果子！</p>
<p>在一本舊有的西文刊物上，居然被我們尋着兩張適合口味的綫路丨丨旣經濟，又簡單丨丨不過因爲牠們都不能一機收發兩用，並且在零件的設備方面都須雙倍，因此，不得不加以改良，這樣一來，不但合乎經濟的原則，在使用管理上更覺方便呢。</p>
<p>待機件配齊後，便開始的較騐，這次，通話機一共裝配了兩架，所以事實上並不發生任何困難！但第一次的通話試騐竟遭失敗！</p>
<p>經了一番細密的檢查之後，才發現是這麽一回事！原來我所用的那只眞空管，因已工作了八個月之譜，燈絲發射電子的力量，自然要减弱得多，在屏壓低時（二十二個半弗打）眞空管竟不起振盪！於是我將Ｂ電加高一倍，然後作第二次的試行！</p>
<p>在清晨試騐，結果竟成功了！這次我們通話的距離有十餘丈之隔，而波長又是五公尺左右的超短波丨丨丨可惜發音的波幅太狹，如果我們不是用緩旋度盤，這次的失敗又是免不了的！</p>
<p>這次的試騐經過，委實有報告給同志們的價值，希望同志們也能利用超短波，來作一次試騐！並且澈底的將超短波來研究一下！這也許比單收聽廣播音樂有意味得多了！</p>
<p>應用零件</p>
<p>Ｃ１爲調節波長用之變量電容器，容量爲００００５ＭＦＤ</p>
<p>Ｃ２爲０００ＩＭＦＤ固定電容器</p>
<p>Ｃ３爲ＯＩＭＦＤ固定電容器</p>
<p>Ｒ１爲Ｉ００００歐姆固定電阻</p>
<p>Ｊ１Ｊ２均爲閉合式揷口</p>
<p>Ｖ１爲３０號省電式眞空管。</p>
<p>Ｔ１爲調幅變壓器</p>
<p>Ｍ爲單鈕式傳聲器</p>
<p>Ｌ１Ｌ２爲綫圈，若波長爲五公尺時，用一英寸徑膠管，Ｌ１與Ｌ２各繞二圈用二十二紗包綫，各圈間須留空隙，以减少損失，若波長爲二十五公尺時，Ｌ１與Ｌ２各繞六圈其餘同上。</p>
<p>登音時，將圖二有Ｘ處，插入插口Ｊ１即可，收简時將聽筒接於Ｊ２卽得。</p>
<p>其他如機中排列地位，以接綫簡短圖二</p>
<p>爲佳，調節時須用緩旋度盤，又如機中面版，須用金屬者，以避免人體感應。</p>
<h3>單管交直流電兩用收音機王懋生</h3>
<p>普通交流電收音機，眞空管最少須用二只，一爲整流一爲檢波，１２Ａ７眞空管，爲最近發明者，合整流與檢波於一管，運用甚爲便利，且交直流電均可應用，效率亦高，兹特介紹如下。</p>
<p>１２Ａ７眞空管，内含五極管與整流管，計燈脚七，栅極在眞空管上頂，各脚所示物件，如附圖所示，全機宜以鋁板爲之，大小約５“Ｘ７”，高約２“，眞空管須加罩，以免雜聲，圖中所示各地綫，可於鋁板上擇一適當點會集一處接之，另配１５“Ｘ７”之膠木板，上裝ＳＷ，Ｒ４Ｃ２，Ｊ等，其他機件，則分别裝於鋁板之上或下。</p>
<p>Ｇrd處，接地綫與不接地綫，亦可，Ｃ１視天綫之高度或長度而定，</p>
<p>此機裝法尚簡單，運用亦便，各機件之容量，如圖中，</p>
<h3>礦石檢波的强力單管機</h3>
<p>— ＫＭＫ</p>
<p>上圖的綫路係將某無綫電雜誌所載而加以改裝的，試騐的效果，成績很是可觀，與普通兩管機可相匹敵，用揚聲器接放本埠各電台之播音，已够響亮，故特將其介紹於此以供愛好讀者的同好，該綫路名爲ＧernsbackMegadyne式，先以礦作檢波，串以强力管作放大，再生力用變量電量器（Ｃ）調節並用變量耗阻器（Ｒ２）以控制音調高低，綫圈Ｌ，三十號漆包綫在三吋徑膠管上繞七十五圈，Ｌ，三十二號漆包綫在一吋半徑膠管上繞四十圈，（裝在Ｌ的中間可使旋轉），Ｒ·Ｆ·Ｃ·可用三十八號漆包綫在四分之三吋徑的木軸上繞二百五二圈（軸之兩頭夾以硬紙以防綫之散亂），Ｃ爲，○○○二五ＭＦ變量電容器Ｃ１，爲，○○○五ＭＦ變量電容器，Ｃ２爲，○○○五ＭＦ固定電容器，Ｃ３與Ｃ同，Ｒ爲五兆歐姆固定耗阻器，（卽５ＭＥＧ栅漏），ＲＸ爲十二歐姆變量燈絲耗阻器，Ｒ２爲一萬歐姆變量耗阻器，Ｄ·Ｃ·爲靈敏礦石，（最好用化合炭式）眞空管用三三號强力五極管，甲電用一·五弗打或三弗打，（用三弗打時燈絲耗阻器勿開足否則燈絲有燒毁之虞），乙電用一百三十五弗打，但用聽筒時，乙電用四十五弗打已够，</p>
<h3>礦石式懷中收音機</h3>
<p>— 劍琴</p>
<p>現所介紹的懷中收音機，曾經由數位同志的試騐，成績都很超著的。牠唯一的優點是携帶便利，（全機均裝入一單獨的聽筒内）而且省去調節上的麻煩。不用天地綫的裝置，故隨時隨地皆可收聽美妙的音樂。兹將牠的詳細製法。分述於下，以供同志的研究。</p>
<p>材料普通聽筒一只靈敏礦石一粒厚馬糞紙一張薄銅片一小方電燈花綫二碼接綫夾子一只製法</p>
<p>Ａ是薄銅片剪成的觸針，虚綫表示裝製時灣曲地位</p>
<p>Ｂ是礦石杯，亦用銅片製成，左右四角灣上夾住礦石，上下兩端空入Ｃ之三小孔内。</p>
<p>Ｃ用厚糞紙剪成，其週圍大小使適與聽筒内壁緊觸，其中之長方孔，大小使聽筒内二綫球適可通過爲度。其旁三小孔裝礦石杯用的。</p>
<p>Ｄ是裝妥後的情形，虚綫表示在紙片下的接綫。</p>
<p>Ｅ是全部的綫路圖</p>
<p>收音方法凡近播音台的地方，祇須將夾子夾在範圍廣大的金屬物上。（例如，鉛片水槽，電綫的鉛包皮，鐵床，銅床，金屬的支架，及金屬烟囱等等）便可收得美妙的音樂了。</p>
<p>附注：收音時夾子所夾之處，須將鐵銹或漆及一切絶緣物刮去，並宜將手心壓在聽筒背面，因其内有綫接着外壳（即觸針及綫圈的一端，均已與磁石相接而由磁石接住外壳，）手壓其上，電流入身，因人身有蓄電作用，可使音量增響。Ｅ圖中的虚綫Ｆ，就是表示這個意思，並非要接地綫也。</p>
<h3>雙揚聲器又一接法</h3>
<p>— 盧桂珍</p>
<p>普通我們接雙揚聲器，在都用以串接或並接等法，現在作者更來介紹一種新接法，是最近才發現的，雖然祗限用於原機須備用電動式揚聲器的！但却十分有趣，凡是收音機上備有電動式揚聲器的同志們均可一試；人旣没有觸電的危險，揚聲器也可以不直接高壓電，故阻力不合，失磁，斷綫等情均可避免；法以揚聲器之一端接原機電動式揚聲器之鐵心，另一頭接地綫柱卽得。</p>
<p>聽筒也可照樣接上使用，毫無損壞的危險。</p>
<h3>選購交流收音機訣要（續）</h3>
<p>— 江之蕃</p>
<p>（三）構造之檢討　一般價廉之舶來品交流收音機，因欲减低成本，内部機件，常未能經久耐用。如濾波電容器多用價值低廉之電液式或電糊式。此種電容器耐壓頗低，且有一定而較爲短促之壽命。若電容器一旦打穿，變壓器，整流管亦受損壞據某大修理公司之統計，收音機之疾病，出於電源，整流及濾波部份者，佔百分之七十五以上。故選購收音機時，最好要有紙質而能耐高壓之濾波電容器，其次爲炭阻電阻及音量控制器（卽可變之炭質電阻），設計不佳，或製造不良，初則於購機數星期後，雜聲大作，終於損壞，而燒壞眞空管及其他機件，亦數見不鮮，蓋炭阻電阻有一定之耗電率。標準化之設計，炭阻耗阻本身之耗電率須爲實際耗電率三倍以上。方不致過熱，生耗阻變化，不易損壞，而能耐長時間之工作。但實際上，其設計多極苛刻，故不能耐用。至於音量控制器，因製造不佳，常常轉動摩擦，亦極易發雜聲，生障礙。其他缺點尚多，總之，貪便宜，無選擇之目標，未有不上當者也。</p>
<p>（四）試聽之秘訣　選購收音機，先應命商家拆視機械内部，濾波電容器是否紙質製造，炭阻電阻是否耗電率甚大。各部構造是否鞏固可靠。再察機件上商標牌或電源變壓器上所註明之應用伏脫數，周波數，是否合乎當地電源。如皆滿意之後，卽可試聽。試聽爲考察收音機之唯一方法，亦需特别注意者。不可任商家收聽已知收音最好之數家，卽認爲滿意。須按節目表，一一收聽，有無雜聲，干擾等情，又其刻盤指數是否與電台之週率數完全吻合。並可與其他牌號收音機比較試聽，則百不一誤。讀者其注意及之。</p>
<h3>内外消息</h3>
<p>沙而文眞空管盛銷　美國並綫電公司經理之沙而文眞空管，確能使收音機有意想不到之効力，故能不多日即風行國中，該管所用材料，皆選最精良上等品質。凡收音機之發音之不響亮者用之，聲宏逼眞，史德華收音機，皆用此種眞空管，故收音成績爲其他機器所不及也。凡備收音機者祈注意及之。</p>
<p>西人Ｍrs·Ｃ·Ｍ·Ｒobertson所有之奇開電台，呼號ＸＱＨＢ，其所發音質之美妙，執西人電台之牛耳，向爲外人所讚美而喜聽。該台新近發生弊病，當即電召大上海無綫電機公司技師，前往修理，數小時間，將其所有弊病，全部修復，音質之音量，較前更佳，該台台主當然非常滿意，並向該公司定造放大機一具，以備該電台放大部份之用，可見該公司技術精良，工程迅速，即西人亦信任該公司，事非偶然也。</p>
<p>大上海無綫電機公司發起人，聖約翰大學數理學士李漢潮君，將於本月十四日乘胡佛總統號輪船放洋赴美，入耶而大學及麻省理工大學，專攻電氣工程及無綫電工程，並於學程完畢後，將入美國著名工廠實習，以資深造，將來學成回國，匪特該公司將添一傑出人才，對於尚在萌芽之中國無綫電事業，亦將有偉大貢獻云。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>吳娘瑣話</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>連日從「來電華」裏·聽女子蘇灘，歌喉宛轉，眞令人盪氣迴腸。猛然想起白樂天的詩；「吳娘暮雨瀟瀟曲，自别江南久不聞」。樂天畢竟是個社會詩人，是個多情者。錢蒙叟有「東風誰唱吳娘曲？暮雨瀟瀟圍禁城」。也說起道暮雨瀟瀟曲，連王漁洋，也有詩道是「波遶雷塘一帶流，至今水調怨揚州，年來慣聽吳娘曲，幕雨上瀟瀟水閣頭」。「七載離筵喚奈何，玉壺紅涙歛青蛾，瀟瀟暮雨南陽驛，重聽吳娘一曲歌」。暮雨瀟瀟，大約實有其曲，不知道比着今日毛毛雨如何？</p>
<p>吳娘不盡能歌，不歌的吳娘，也有艶稱人口的，如吳門畫舫錄上所載的船娘，就是一百年前蘇州的艶跡所寄。後來倉橋浜成了楷杷門巷，船娘就落伍了。可是有幾個畫舫，那把櫓的，還是窈窕多姿呢。曾孟樸的孽海花，就有這熱水船的描寫，所以稱做熱水船，爲了船兒摇得慢吞吞地，把水都攙得熱騰騰了。可是現在不行了，雖然畫舫還可以在廣濟橋畔找到幾個，那船娘都是鷄皮鶴髮，那一個少女，還耐煩在這冷水船上株守呢。</p>
<p>喜娘也是吳娘中間的一個角兒，練成了一張天花亂隊的嘴，要是隔着牆兒聽，誰也辦不出伊的老少村俏，總是軟綿綿地，悠揚動聽。伊們靠着幾套老規矩，和太太奶奶們的傳統家法，還能世世相傳，在婚喪喜慶中，占一個位置。但是有許多人家，也在革除了。</p>
<p>以前蘇州的婦女都喜歡考究髮髻，嫌自已手段不佳，便招人代梳，因此有一種梳頭娘姨産生了。大概做這種生活的人，年紀决不能過大，伊們穿房入户，在所不禁的，並且與女主顧可以無所不談，在從前當然也是當行出色的。自從風行截髮以後，生意就大形寥落了。</p>
<p>後面的兩種娘兒們，在蘇州的社會上，已成了强弩之末，那麽吳娘之爲吳娘，也就憔悴可憐了。</p>
<p>至於能歌的吳娘，也是不振，舊時勾欄，現在雖然仍舊可以侑酒留髠，可是不能公然飛箋應召，並且當筵也是寂寂不歌，那麽暮雨瀟瀟曲，幾乎在蘇州聽不到了。只有女說書，麽景兒唱幾個俗曲，大概聽歌的人，也是醉翁之意居多，那麽吳娘之歌，不是將成絶響了麽？</p>
<h3>閒話蘇州</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>蘇城係龜形，從前只有六城門。這就是象徵龜的一頭一尾與四只脚，相傳元末徐達以長圍張士誠於蘇州，九月不能克。有一個人獻計道：「蘇城是龜形。六處同攻則愈堅，不如擇其一處急攻，方可破之。」那時恰巧士誠有一個親信名呌李司徒的，密差人至徐達軍前納欵，徐達乃得攻閶門而入。</p>
<p>閶門向稱繁庶葑門則極蕭條。同　一城門，何以有若是之異，這其間亦有一個小小掌故：徐達旣攻閶門而入，不殺一人，號稱仁義之師。那時常遇春因城久不破，努從葑門入，即三歲小兒亦不能免。徐達雖急使人捧令牌止之，然葑門一帶已飽嘗流血之痛。所以葑門獨蕭條而閶門則極繁庶至今還是如此。</p>
<p>張士誠，蘇州人至今對他是還有餘思的。廢歷七月三十日家家户户燒九思香、即是紀念他的恩德。蘇城旣不守，士誠的母親對他道：「我兒敗了，我的話如何？」士誠乃盡驅骨肉登齊雲樓，縱火焚之。他獨不死，說：「我救一城人命；」遂俯首就縛。這是蘇州鄕土史上的一椿大悲劇。</p>
<p>蘇州古稱「姑蘇。」按姑蘇乃姑胥，臺與山皆以伍胥得名。吳語誤「胥」爲「蘇」，故云「姑蘇」。一說，吳國旣滅，姑蘇臺亦廢，獨有胥山在，因稱它做「孤胥」；後來誤「胥」爲「蘇，」誤「孤」爲「姑」，遂有「姑蘇」之稱。</p>
<p>葑門的旱城門，在從前太平天國時代，增經一度改作「小東門。」原有石弔橋，亦是那時拆毁的；城河中停着砲船，以資防守。按蘇州有小東門。這個小典故。再隔一二十年，恐怕不會有人知道了，因記之。</p>
<h3>杭州的夜西湖</h3>
<p>— 白瑩</p>
<p>在杭州，夜西湖會因着炎夏而熱閙起來的。</p>
<p>尤其在廢曆六月十八。</p>
<p>廢曆六月十八是觀音大士誕日，於是，老太婆得大唸其佛，西子湖也得照例地閙一夜荷花燈！</p>
<p>據老人說：在前清還得通夜的大開三座城門，自藩道台以次都得和老百姓一樣的遊湖、閙個通天明！</p>
<p>自然，今年也不能因水旱災而作罷的，乾一商塲早已向徽州以一千元代價買了預備替六月十八的西子湖凑熱閙的上好烟火，報上登載了，人，怒潮也似的轟動着。</p>
<p>於是乎，今年的六月十八的夜西湖更熱閙更生動了！</p>
<p>我也被朋友嬲着凑了個數。</p>
<p>進湖濱第六公園，時候約莫九點半吧。可是，這時的遊人已密得像白螞蟻似的，壓脚根兒，難聞的粉香和着汗氣一陣陣的帶進人的鼻孔，人簡直欲作嘔了！</p>
<p>聽說十點鐘放烟火，時候將到了，天忽下着雨。公園裏的人霎時亂了，人擠着向門外走；有些膽大的，仍倒在草地上，很閒地看天上的烏雲幾朶圓的幾朶方的。</p>
<p>雨下得微了，名之曰發寶的搭在水上的那一千元代價的烟火架子搭得很高，一條一條蛇也似蜿蜒着的徽州烟火衝天直上，火紅的！</p>
<p>「哦，烟火來了！烟火來了！」</p>
<p>在這歡呼聲裏，許多遊客又重復的擠進門來。湖濱公園裏又那麽的人擠了！</p>
<p>天朗，月帶着凉意起在天際，西湖是更美了！湖四週紅燈閃閃，水波激得那麽有趣！</p>
<p>湖面上透出銀鈴似的幾聲歌聲，帶進每個人的心頭横着，鐫着。</p>
<p>啊，在這裏没有旱災！没有水災！</p>
<h3>飛來秘密</h3>
<p>— 師誠</p>
<p>西子風光，清雅絶俗；淡妝濃抹，莫不相宜。余嘗登初陽台，俯瞰西湖全景；隄垂綠柳，波映山光，梵宫掩映於翠微，鐘聲時聞於蘭若，宛如身入畫中，不復有人間烟火氣息！說者謂環湖勝景，首推雲林；靈隱飛來，尤盡石怪峯奇之致！斯言也，余頗然之。</p>
<p>一綫天在飛來峰下，石隙如綫，微護天光，極目仰觀，中現佛像，或醜或妍，或金或赤；遊者所見，人各不同。善男信女，遂謂吾佛有靈，現兹聖蹟；叢林香火，於焉大增。殊不知以色相見如來，已犯釋氏是人行邪道之戒。而寺僧猶廣事宣傳，以愚黔首。甚矣，迷信中人之深也！</p>
<p>寂照大師，余方外交也；倜儻風雅，瀟灑出俗；嘗於月夜，與余同應姚子元幹之召，飲於其居。姚子嗜藝花，登其台，萬紫千紅，如入衆香國裏；月下飛觴，别饒興趣，清談娓娓，樂而忘疲。酒半酣，偶舉相詢；師輾然曰，此欺人之術耳，子何惑之甚耶？余笑謝之，並叩其故。師曰：峯石玲瓏，中多孔竅。寺僧擇其大者，置風車其中，八面均塑佛像，服裝形色，各各不同，石隙風來，旋轉不已。自下仰觀，所見又僅一綫，故佛像之映於眼簾者，隨時而異也。苟於峰巓據石隙下窺，眞相畢露矣。歷年旣久，知者遂鮮，驚以爲神，不亦惑乎？姚子曰：技誠巧矣！獨不處遊人之發其覆耶？師曰：石隙過多，頗難覓到、且峰頂荆棘叢生，亦足以裏遊人之足也。師之言如此，其蒙莊之寓言耶？抑實有所見耶？不可　而知矣。姑誌之以待後證。</p>
<h3>蘇州素描</h3>
<p>— 蔚記</p>
<p>蘇州，稱爲天堂的蘇州。想來大家都是在羨慕居住着蘇州的人們。</p>
<p>蘇州在從前稱爲天堂，眞是受之無愧。可是現在，蘇州也受到了失業恐慌，經濟破産。再不有從前的可羨了。</p>
<p>現在我來談談如今之蘇州。</p>
<p>觀前街，天堂中最繁盛的一條街。現在郤滿掛着大减價的旗幟。每家商店更用着無綫電，佈送着美妙的音樂，滑稽的談話，想引起行人駐足，但仍是商業清淡。</p>
<p>電影院中，開映着頭等的影片，而售最低的價錢。但仍門庭冷落，觀客甚少。</p>
<p>薦頭店裏，坐滿了許多鄕間的女子。伊們的丈夫受到了農村經濟破産的影響，呌伊們到都市中謀生。</p>
<p>金閶路上，一到晚上。旅館旁便排列着許多的女子。出賣伊的肉身，尋伊今夜的主顧。</p>
<p>總之，天堂已感到不景氣了，也許，將來會一變而成地獄！</p>
<h3>杭州的宵夜粥店</h3>
<p>— 矜細</p>
<p>杭州旗下的延齡路一帶是宵夜粥店的集中地點，在這帶街上的宵夜粥店都雇用著年輕的女招待，粥店老閶利用女人的媚眼與笑靨來誘致顧客而擴大他們的營業。以同一事實爲類比，杭州宵夜粥店之性質恰與上海之佳妃座相似。</p>
<p>名雖爲粥店，但就其營業範圍看來，實爲一種變相的酒樓，那些年輕貌美的女招待却是店中最能推銷酒菜的人員。單靠幾盌稀飯數盆小菜的生意，老闆們的出息是微乎其微的，其間全恃女招待慇懃地招待那些略略帶點色躁病的顧客，伊們有一種魅力，足以催迫顧客來點上幾樣他們所不必需要的小菜，而這小菜的售價又是那麽昂貴的。</p>
<p>出入於宵夜粥店的，多爲汽車夫，商店小職員，退伍的軍警，此外或許有幾個富翁，紳士，大人，畫家，和政府機關的公務人員，但究爲少數。宵夜粥店女招待工作時間，自下午一時開始，到晚上十二時止，下午一時到七時的時候，肯花錢的顧客是寥寥無幾的，當夜幕展開，電炬輝煌之際，即有諸色雜流的顧客，麕聚在宵夜粥店裏喝酒，點菜，揮拳，調戲女招待，扮演著各種醜劇，酒酣耳熱，顧客的手是會在女招待身上每一部分旅行著，伊們不會拒絶，伊們知道顧客正爲得到這點好處才來的。</p>
<p>不合理的社會，那有合理的生活，即此一端，亦可知杭州貧家女職業上人格是如何的低落了。</p>
<h3>西湖酒家</h3>
<p>— （波光）</p>
<p>酒能興奮神經，助長血液循環，少飲些，確有不可思議的效能。掛着「太白遣風」招牌的酒家，不論在大都市中，或農村間，隨處都可以見到。一般酒徒，終朝沈湎在麴藥裏。反把正事荒疎了，這就失却飲酒的旨趣了。</p>
<p>西湖，有數十家酒家，都是紅女當爐，很有幾個姿色不惡的。飲酒的朋友，往往低斟淺酌，戀戀不捨，他們是醉翁之意不在酒，已在想入非非了！</p>
<p>酒家用女招待，的確是招徠主顧的一個善法，講一句歪話，就是「酒是色媒人」，酒色確有連帶的關係啊！</p>
<h3>蘇州天平山下的抬轎婦女</h3>
<p>— 朱維明</p>
<p>船未到天平山麓，在隔岸綠蔭下的茅舍中便有二三個壯健的婦女，迎了出來，一看見船在石橋邊靠下，便跳躍着奔到沿岸，爭先搶着說：「轎子要吧？坐轎上山去吧！」柔軟而婉轉的吳儂語音，比爵士音樂更爲動聽。</p>
<p>我臨風立在船頭上，浮萍依在我肩旁，笑向伊們說：「轎子是要的，只是我們須吃了飯才上山呢」，伊們知道希望是不會落空的了，便都歡笑着說：「喔！那末我們也去吃了飯來」。一齊扭轉嬌軀很輕捷的跑去，消失在綠影後面。我們狼吞虎嚥的午餐，還未吃到一半的時候，一個二十餘歲的少婦，先已回到了岸邊候着，伊悄悄地坐在一塊伸出水面的白石上，黑而大的眼睛，豐滿而壯健的腰身，露出了小小的嘴唇對我們凝望，一會兒忽又微笑，一會兒把手掌潑弄着碧油油的水浪，身影倒映在波中，隨着汨汨的微波顫動。</p>
<p>上山時一共僱了四頂轎子。抬轎的人，女子倒佔了六個；伊們是一樣的壯健，一樣的面目曼妙；伊們也都很年輕，只有十七八至二十餘歲。其中兩個是少女，桃花頰上的紅雲，顯出伊們正在最動人愛的時代，但是生活的擔子已壓在伊們的肩上，牛馬般的（抬轎不是非人生活嗎？）勞働，驅策伊們在人生路上挣扎。其餘的二位男子漢，却是一對烟霞城中的俘虜。惟悴，瘦弱，猥瑣。從他們的言談與稱呼中聽起來，這一對烟鬼，還是内中兩個少婦的丈夫。</p>
<p>翻了兩個山頭，大約有十餘里路，我們安適的坐在轎中，已經覺到有些顚播得倦了。一對烟鬼，當然是全不中用，累得要命。可是六個婦女，却始終健步如飛。但大汗也已似潮水一般從額上滾到嘴邊，濕透了頸背，滲入了衣褲，全身如洗了個澡，熱氣蓬勃地發散着。伊們立刻把外衣脫去，只留着一件短小的襯衫，豐滿的乳峯，抖抖地似乎要跳出襯衫外面來了。抬着我的一個少婦，一手在揮拭着臉上直掛下來的大汗，一手在捲起褲管。「啊呀！汗把我的褲子也浸落了顔色，你們看我大腿上已一榻糊塗了」。原來伊穿的是藍色布褲，把褲管捲得高高的，大腿全露了出來，仰起了臉只是儍笑。</p>
<p>天平山的抬轎婦女，在遊客的口中是很加以稱道的，我想這裏面定必包含着工會環境的關係。所以我趁此時機便詳細的詢問伊們的生活情形。據云附近因爲多山，土地生産力薄弱，山田又是不值錢的。山上又没有什麽出産，男子無所事事，每天都坐在茶館裏談天，而且大半沾有烟癮和紅丸嗜好。他們所能找到的唯一的工作，便是爲人開山搬掘石頭。然而做開山工人的男子，更没有一個是不吃鴉片或吞紅丸的，他們工資是三天一元錢，可是他們的烟毒消耗、一元錢只够二天。所以不僅他們衣食住的費用，要逼迨着妻子們做牛做馬來供給；便是他們的鴉片烟，也要熬煎着妻子們的血汗來吞吸。婦女除抬轎以外，還從事剌繡的副業，這差不多是伊們世傳的技藝而且人物花卉，都繡得異常精妙。在上海市塲上銷行着的顧繡，實際上全是伊們的出産。顧繡莊派跑街下鄕，把應做的工作交給伊們，約定時期再來收取。然而工資是異常的低薄，統扯只二三百錢一天。所以伊們一見有遊客上山，都搶着來抬轎子，雖則勞苦，至少終有幾毛錢可得。</p>
<p>遊天平山歸來的仕女們，只聽見他們艶稱抬轎婦女的曼妙壯健，或至多感到一些驚奇，怎知伊們的實際生活，却是如此的苦痛呀！留心婦女問題者，可以參考一下。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「佳人」與「才子」</h3>
<p>— 王壬</p>
<p>一個時代，必然産生一種特殊人物，這是一定的道理。中國自古迄今，朝朝天子，就有許多英雄名士輔佐。同時又産生着不少點綴人物：如所謂佳人，才子，翻開每一本古書，總可發見他們事蹟的。</p>
<p>自然，在已往封建和禮儀道德堅壁之下，也有過所謂孝子順孫的特種人物，而婦女們的什麽守身如玉，樹得起貞節牌坊的更是數見不鮮呵！</p>
<p>然而現在時代已經變了。再不是出忠臣孝子，節婦烈女的時代了。到而今所遣留給我們印象還算存在的，就只才子佳人。然而此才子，此佳人者，亦不是如往昔文質彬彬，岸然道貌，或風流瀟灑，便是稱爲才子，佳人，亦不像從前終年深處閨中，養的一身白皮膚兒，吟風弄月，剌繡操琴，方能當得起此種美譽。現在的才子，必須在文縐的氣習當中，附帶着英雄的本色，而且要有專長：如什麽詩人，什麽小說家，藝術家……才可當得起比衆不同，成功了社會間的一個才子。否則，在芸芸衆生之中，才子的令譽，是不能讓你擅有的。說到佳人，也都如此。而且現在的佳人，一定不是深居弱質，或會得吟詩，會得書寫，可能勝任愉快，她應和男子樣的到外間活動，在廣大的集團與羣衆之中，去搶上一個值得人稱譽的美名、如交際花，皇后，與什麽家等，否則、佳人之不會到自已頭上來，永世永生也如泛泛之流不過是個無名脂粉而已！</p>
<p>所以現在的才子佳人，在社會　　一樣　　往昔貴重地位，而取之之道，就大大不同。</p>
<p>我們現在可舉例兩個在目前最出風頭的男女，這是不妨也把他譽着才子佳人的！</p>
<p>一個是數月前頭，由德飛渡歸國的青年飛行家孫桐崗氏，他在德國留學的時候，當然没有半個人知道，但待他一旦奮起，所謂「不飛則已，一飛驚人」不上兩個月功夫，居然譽滿全國，這樣的一個成功，雖然他自有特殊技藝，但我們把他也譽爲時代的才子，是未嘗不可以的。</p>
<p>一個便是正在大出風頭的所謂「美人魚」的楊秀瓊小姐，自全運之後，現露聲名，再在遠運又得勝利，被譽爲「中國小姐」數月之間，青雲直上，一到今朝，幾至有顚倒衆生的魔力，幾乎把整個社會的人都爲她瘋狂起來，某中委願降格爲之執鞭，其他名流大賈，亦莫不倒拜石榴裙下，一些青年的小伙子，不論男的女的，簡直因羨慕之深而幾涶涎欲滴了丨丨聲明：這不是作者侮辱楊女士，或開什麽玩笑，照這幾天各方熱烈歡迎楊女的情緒，可以證明丨丨因此，楊女士在這譽滿全國，大大的成功之下，當然領受佳人美譽而綽綽有餘，她應該是佳人中的佳人。</p>
<p>我們讚成孫桐崗和楊秀瓊式的才子佳人，我們不願見專是舞文弄墨和調脂抹粉的往昔那樣的才子佳人。但是，我們在希望之餘，深望成功的才子佳人，不以其成功專作出風頭工具，或僅是如往昔的才子佳人，只成爲社會間的點綴品，我們希望凡是才子，凡是佳人，都能將他成功才子佳人的學問，技能。對國家有眞確的貢獻，對社會有實際的報效，母徒膺美名作了一般人的玩物和娱樂東西！</p>
<h3>人的哲學</h3>
<p>— 席珍</p>
<p>平常看見航空奬劵廣告上的「每條一元，人人可得。」總覺得在邏輯上有點兒欠通。「人人可得」的話是說不過去的，「拿不出一塊錢的人就不可得咧。」自已常常那麽想。</p>
<p>可是，有一天走在街上，看見一家小飯店門口圍着一圈人，擠進去看：大個子的老板扭住了一個小夥子要錢，說是總共一塊多錢，欠了一個多月還不給。「連一塊錢都拿不出，還能算人嗎？你老子拚着不要了，把那件外套給留下來，你給我滾！」接着便是一個耳聒子。</p>
<p>「連一塊錢都拿不出的還能算人嗎？」哲學家的地吟味着那句話，想着「每條一元，人人可得」的句子，便像數學家解答了一個難題似的高興得跳起來了。我懂了，我懂了！一旦豁然貫通焉！</p>
<p>「拿不一塊錢的人原來根本不能算得人的，那未這「人人可得」不絶對的通了嗎？」</p>
<p>吟味着這聊聊的八個字，是現社會的清晣的翦影啊。使把它當作文學的，哲學的珍品而記憶着。柏拉圖對話集中是找不出那種語句的。</p>
<p>譬如說，人和其他動物（那便是說：禽獸之屬）如果有一點不同的話，按現社會的環境說，便是因爲人類有錢，而其他動物便没有。頑碩如電影中的猩猩王金剛，它知道愛女人，可是它便不知道愛袁世凱，這一點便顯出人類在動物界中的卓異了。這樣，誠如航空奬劵的廣告上所含蓄的，小飯店門口的塲面所顯示的，僅僅是一塊錢，它便做了人和其他動物間的分界綫：「有一塊錢便是人，没有一塊錢是算不得人的。」</p>
<p>想到老茨基曾做過一個「人爲什麽和其他的動物不同？」這問題的解答，在他底答案中，他企圖從勞動的方法上說明人與其他動物的不同，他底結論是：人能創造生産器械而且從而使用之；其他動物（甚至像人猿猩猩之類）便不能。如果一定要用老茨基的話來解釋小飯店老板的意見，那也並不是絶對辦不到的事：近代的生産器械不是「錢」嗎？這話不用多想，餓過肚子的人直覺都能懂得的。</p>
<p>可是眞不幸得很，人若果眞用「錢」來做和其他動物中間的分界綫，那眞不是聰明的事。要是這樣，人類還那裏再用得到在動物界中，自傲呢？一旦别的動物取到了那種「製造生産器械」的能力，不是也能和人類一樣了嗎？讓我們舉一個實例來說明一下；「在現代，没有錢的人是過着非人生活的。」這話大概不會被否認了吧？可是如果我們想一想死了的狗明星玲丁丁呢，它是和人類一樣的能用自已的服務來換錢，它是能製造了「生産器械」而給人的；於是它便過着舒適的富人生活，享受着優越的「上等人」的地位了。</p>
<p>平常我們聽見有人說：「現在的世界眞不成個樣子了，有錢是人；没錢的便是畜生。」把它翻過來，我們看到：「人没有錢是畜生，畜生有了錢一樣也是人哩。」</p>
<p>以前我們說，「錢」還祇是人與其他動物間的分界綫，而現在「錢」竟又進一步做了「人類」的入塲劵啦。「人類重地，閒人莫入」：可是有入塲劵的是不在此例的。</p>
<p>郤願意這是一個神話，一個無稽的傳說啊；可是事實清楚要放在我們面前，我們是不容否認的。曾看到一個哲人在他底書上寫過一句話：「人類並不是一種聰明的動物。」至少，在對「錢」的狂熱這一點上，我們是不能不相信的。</p>
<p>可是因爲大家都要有了錢才能吃飯，於是連自已也不得不做一個「並不聰明的動物。」然而，我自已便從此消失了人類的驕傲。不錯的：「人類並不是一種聰明的動物啊。」</p>
<p>在「並不聰明」的狀態中，我們便永久爲取得「人類的入塲劵」而努力吧。</p>
<p>見聞錄</p>
<h3>粤省的四不同主義</h3>
<p>— 阿鳳</p>
<p>粤省當局厲行禁止男女同行後，而廣東的政治研究會，更通過男女界限五項：（一）禁止男女同車，（二）禁止男女同食，（三）禁止男女同住，（四）禁止軍人人民同行，（五）電影館禁止開演男女共演影片，以上五項，除第四項在「同」之例外，多是有關男女共同行爲的禁令，約略舉之，就是禁止男女共泳，共行，共食，共住，卽可謂之四不同主義。</p>
<p>粤省賭博公開，吃烟公開，全任人民自由，並不禁止，獨對於男女之間，特别戒嚴，恐比周公之禮，還要勝過一籌，這是什麽意思？眞是禁其所不當禁，而不禁其所當禁，如此「開倒車」的政策，令人可發一笑。兹戲擬竹枝詞兩首錄後：</p>
<p>其一</p>
<p>男女大防禁令公，泳行住食不能同。</p>
<p>洞天别有供遊傲，盡在烟巢賭窟中。</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>苛捐雜稅幾重重，烟賭徵來格外兇。</p>
<p>最是青年倒灶處，鴛鴦分裂不相逢！</p>
<h3>蘇州的小熱昏</h3>
<p>我曾到過蘇州，遊過玄妙觀，聽小熱昏白嚼蛆，甚爲有趣，他說，人是生差了，眉毛應該生在指頭上，可當牙刷用，鼻子應該倒轉生，可揷「派克」或「康克林」墨水筆，眼睛一只應該生在前面，一只應該生在後面，可以前後照顧，屎眼應該生在頭頂上，逢雨天可以揷揷傘，這種說話，眞是異想天開，聽衆都張開了嘴對他笑。</p>
<p>結果他賣去了百草梨膏糖數百塊，寃哉！</p>
<h3>一天</h3>
<p>— 孟君</p>
<p>清晨醒來，淡黃色的陽光，已斜度的映到床頭，照得耀眼睛，卽使想翻個身來一下復覺，怕也不能再睡得穩。落起身，從鉛壺裏取了些冷水，漱了口，洗了把面，看看鐘，已七點半了。</p>
<p>這時，母親也起身了，她問我要吃什麽吧？可呌阿金去買？天天早晨母親這樣問我，我總因爲時間的侷促，弄些冷飯淘淘開水，就算用一餐早飯了事。這，在我是不意爲一樁事的，但母親總牢是望着我，好像；太淡清吧？</p>
<p>等我穿好衣服，臨出門的時候回過頭看看鐘，又毫不客氣地過了一刻鐘時間，是七點三刻了。走出口門，心裏盤算着，如若路上没躭誤的話，八點半前還能趕得上到廠裏，雖然，遲到十分鐘或刻把鐘，不見得就怎麽樣，我何必要看他們一副嘴臉呢？走到電車站，恰巧電車就來。</p>
<p>從電車裏跳下再換上公共汽車，看見大世界對面的大鐘正指着八點。在這個時候踏上公共汽車，總有幾隻天天遇見的熟臉看見，大家都是機械地坐下，抽烟，或望着窗外。</p>
<p>所謂「上寫字間」者便是在這個辰光。</p>
<p>車到四川路，一批人下去，外灘，一批人下去，南京路，北京路，一批批的下去，待一過北京路車中就寥寥没有幾個。「吃洋行飯的，」上海就獨多這種人才！腦海中又浮起一句永遠不會忘記的話：「在上海，要招一百隻狗不甚容易，要招一百個會講英語的華人，頓時立刻就能辦到。」</p>
<p>次殖民地的敎育，煞是辦得成績斐然，不能不呌我傷心。</p>
<p>車到目的地，已是八點半只差五分了。跳下車，走進廠屋，軋軋的機器聲，已迎耳而來。廠，一切如常，跨進門，看門的總是「×先生，早，」有時也添一句「今天熱吧？」回答也不過點一下頭，或一聲「唔」。</p>
<p>公事案上堆滿的無非是信件單了，辦公室的窗口等着二三個工頭要鑰匙取材料。理這樣，忙那椿，一個上半天，甚至於没有五分鐘辰光讓你抽口閒烟。</p>
<p>時光往往在人忙東忙西的當兒，飛馳得更快，上半天三個半鐘頭一刹那成了過去。接着嘘！一聲汽笛聲，該是午飯時候。廠中並不供給午飯，祇好自已上飯館去吃。時常一碗什味湯二碗白飯，一天中第二餐飯算吃過。這一碗什味湯眞可稱得名符其實，青菜，綫粉，肉皮，千張，毛豆，還有些呌不出名目的東西和在裏面，併成大大的一碗。一等飯，所費總不出三百六十文至五百文間。</p>
<p>下午，一點鐘起又該日辦公時候一直到五點鐘止，工人不散，不會有一點空閒的。今天，更是例外，一天分内的工作到五點鐘還没有做完，寫這樣，抄那樣，靜靜的，除了看們的，廠裏就祗賸了我一個在。假使要怨命的話，那眞怨不了這麽許多，單就工人在規定時間以外工作可以記Ｏyertime多給工資一樁，就够自嘆不如了。</p>
<p>離開廠，一個疲乏的身體投入公共汽車裏，坐下來來簡直不願意再動一動了。車上縱有一二花花綠綠的婦女在我們身旁或對面坐下，也不能提起這一雙下垂的眼睛。</p>
<p>車到大世界，下意識地抬起兩隻眼睛朝着對面那隻大鐘望去，正正的指着七點鐘。</p>

<h3>欠付房租</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我實在覺得有點開不出口，很難爲情把我這種事情告訴先生，但環境壓迫着我，使我不得不向先生請敎。</p>
<p>我在北四川路借了一間房子，最近因爲失業的原故，房租積欠三月，在兩月前房東就一再催逼，讓我繳付，否則他寗願犧牲一月房錢請我搬家。先生，人窮志短，我飯都吃不週全，還那裏有錢付房租，友朋家見我窮，也不肯讓我住進。因此，我就哄騙他，說下個月家裏一定有錢回來，如果下個月不繳他可以扣我的物件。可是到如今依然故我，毫無辦法。於是房東一面驅我用去一</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>一面把我的一切物件都扣住。幸而有位朋友，總算顧念交情留我住下，不致流落街頭。但日用之物，總須自備，因此我便向房東去索回面盆手巾等物。不料房東堅執非付清不給。我說，單我一張床已足抵付欠租，你把我一切物件扣住是何理由。但他不給我講理，我亦無法。請問先生，我是否有權利取回應用什物？我用何法對付他，務祈指敎，專肅順頌</p>

<p>答：欠繳房租，房東不特有權將你的物件留置，並且可就留置物取償或拍賣，無須聲請法院。留置權是可以按照質權的辦法拍賣的。但是所留置的東西，也有相當範圍，留置物祗須足以償付欠租，其餘的物件房客卽可以取回。你一張床的價值已足以抵付房租，則其餘的物件自可取回。他若不同你講理，你可將民法續編租賃規定，翻給他看，這樣，他自然就無話可說了。</p>

<h3>呆子（四）</h3>
<p>— 林彬</p>
<p>飢餓使呆子變成了没工錢白吃飯的長工，白天肚子裏雖不像從前那麽響得厲害，但夜間却多了一種牛欄特有的剌鼻的惡臭。</p>
<p>他每天迎着峭厲的曉風，踏着濕潤的霜露，同着主人去到遼闊的田野，或登上峻削的柴山，直到黑暗吞没了大地，除了吃中飯的時光，是没有絲毫休息的。而晚間在黃豆般的火油燈光的跟前獨自個春出幾臼米，或伴着女主人磨了斗把小麥，也是平常的事。</p>
<p>爲了激發他殘留在粗大的軀幹裏的氣力，爲要使他完全忘記了疲勞和休息，主人是時刻灌以興奮劑的。所謂興奮劑者，也不過是「某某的女兒才貌雙全，只要你好好地給我做生活，我一定給你講來做老婆。」或「我給你講過了，她父親快答應了。」這一類永遠不兌現的空話，呆子就以這種空話的代價，而時刻不停地，死心塌地地出賣着自已唯一的所有物丨丨勞力。</p>
<p>他在田間工作或在山上砍柴的時候，老是哼着鄙野淫蕩的山歌，歌聲粗嗄而響亮，使四週的高山深谷發出有力的回聲。</p>
<p>他唱到疲倦的時候，聲音漸漸低微下來。但不靜默，代替響亮的歌聲的，是低聲的獨的。他東一句西一句地扯個不住，有時似乎也扯到他的故鄕，故鄕的豪强，以及他自已的身世和老婆。</p>
<p>「眞好看哪！龍鳳眼，失下巴，三寸脚。眞好看哪！」他形容自已老婆時老是這幾句話。</p>
<p>他的亂絲般的談話，談話時藴蓄着無限的苦惱和悲哀，眼睛深處的火一般的憤怒的閃光，浮現在眼角上的小小的晶瑩的涙粒，以及包藏着刮刀鋒利似的强笑的苦臉，在在昭示人們一頁被踐踏的農夫的傷心剌骨的痛史，和想撕破這頁傷心剌骨的痛史而不可得的無可奈何悲愴。</p>
<p>「那麽你的老婆現在那兒呀？」别人問。</p>
<p>「人家佔去了。」</p>
<p>「誰？」</p>
<p>「張行善。」</p>
<p>接着就提高嗄嗓子唱了起來，歌聲有些兒顫：</p>
<p>「張行善，不是人，活佔人妻罪非輕！」</p>
<p>「爲什麽？」</p>
<p>「三石五租榖。」</p>
<p>「你交不出三石五租榖就給你老婆佔了去嗎？這幾年都是荒年呀！」</p>

<h3>復古運動聲中的禁映男女共演影片（下）</h3>
<p>— 丹楓</p>
<p>譬如說，假使將要人們的姨太太的瀟灑風流，當作新聞片而搬上銀幕，就得有化裝的馬弁和衛兵等在她前後呼喝追隨，而這種馬弁衛兵等便是男人。如此這般，將如何是好了？當然，這是帶些惡意宣傳而應當取締的。但是假使有某電影公司等因奉此的拍一部宣傳空公路建設之類的片子，這是爲黨爲國的了不起偉大的工作，那末其中將少不了有某夫人太太，或者是千金小姐之類的娘兒們，穿戴得整整齊的來擲香檳或者剪綵帶，而同時旁邊就更少不了委員同志們演說帮忙，熱閙熱閙，點綴點綴，這樣一來，又是男女雜沓，大不合乎三代古風，又將如何是好？</p>
<p>國片的情形旣是如此，而另一方面說，對於　國影片將怎樣呢？大家都知道，外國影片有摟抱，有開斯，有我愛你，有「艾王迪油」，男女相悅，怪難爲情，比較中國影片，肉麻多矣，孔夫子見着摇頭，柳下惠亦難免不亂，其與大人先生們的道德觀念，相去太遠，乃是彰明較著的事實，那末，不都是要一概禁絶麽？自不待言，「大道之行，天下爲公」，照着「聖經」所示，當然得中外一體，一視同仁。不過果眞如此，却恐怕不容易辦到。因爲這樣一來，不是要損傷友邦的好感麽，不是要開罪於洋大人了麽？這决不是好玩兒的。</p>
<p>再說罷，關於女人們，日本在明治以前，她們是不能和丈夫同桌吃飯的，當男人吃飯的時候，女人在旁跪着侍候添飯，直到他們吃好了她們才有飯吃。這種殘酷的規矩，直到現在，在日本鄕間也許還有若干存在。那末中國也照樣做起來，難道就是做亡國奴的準備工作嗎？當然，我們是不敢妄測大人先生們的高深了。</p>
<p>不久，有人預料今後的廣州，或將在馬路中間築一座高牆，以别男女，照此例推，今後的中國電影，必定是祇准男人騎馬射擊，或者是祗准女人們懷抱舞蹈，不得已的時候，談談同性戀愛吧？若不然就祇准「孤軍魂」或「女性」在中國開映了，不過這種片子太少，確也不容易做到。</p>
<p>不過，我們却記得在將軍們指揮刀之下所製作出來的「瓊島風雲」或「心腹之患」，都是描寫過寡廉鮮恥男女相悅之行爲的不知是否也在禁止之列？否則自已的嘴吧給打得發紅，不是也是點隱隱作痛麽？（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「小安琪」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>LittleＭissＭarker</p>
<p>丨丨大光明丨丨</p>
<p>在一種良心道德的觀念之下，劇作者企圖以善言勸誘的方法，使一般無業流氓之輩，在他作品之下感化過來，這一動機，使電影多少擔負其敎育化的使命，無論如何，他的用心是很可取的。</p>
<p>然而我們必須以眞實來感動人，也就是說。假使不是百分之百的眞實，决不會發生感動的力量。從這一方面說，「小安琪」的劇作者是没有做到的，他離開經濟的條件，而空口說敎。</p>
<p>我們該不會完全相信，那些賭棍之流能爲了一個小女孩而犧牲一切吧？我們也不會相信他們能爲了博取那女孩的歡心而舉行盛大的化裝跳舞吧？諸如此類，確使我們相信那不過是劇作者那般說說罷了。</p>
<p>關於這一方面，我們和軟性論者的說法完全不同，他們以爲電影中所表現的，不一定要世界上眞有那麽一回事，而我們的要求，却是百分之百的從一般人所通有而平凡的生活中去表現比眞實更眞實的眞實。「小安琪」的缺點就在這裏，假使劇作者並不過於誇張的空想，那我們以爲就「人間愛」方面去描寫、乃是可以使人民感激得流涙的。</p>
<p>就因爲内容的决定，導演到底没有方法掩飾劇本的缺憾，他的長處祗是將空氣製造得非常明快，使劇情毫不滯澀的進展下去；這主要的成就是在那小孩身上，一種自然流露的善和美，像神話，也像寓言，在銀幕上充滿了快樂的諧趣。我們雖然在少許塲合，感覺非現實的誇張，但在若干塲面中，那種善的美，揚溢在靜的氣圍裏，的確不是庸俗的導演所能做到的。這些，特别是小孩兒睡眠前的講故事，或天眞的禱告等塲面中表現出來，而自小孩被馬踢傷之後，那劇的高潮的形成，直到史迪維輸血時爲止，從每個人焦急的動態，以及史迪維從門外看到人們臉上嚴肅的表情，還有施行手術時的空氣，都說明了導演是很有把握的攫住了觀衆的同情。</p>
<p>前面說過，本劇主要的成績，是小女演員秀蘭陳波兒獲得了極大的效果，差不多她的每一句話，每一個動作，因爲她易於得人寵愛的，大部份的時間中、她是敎人們歡喜得譁然大笑的。其次應以亞道夫孟郁最爲成功，這比較他素以風流瀟洒見稱的各戲比較起來，我們以爲他在這裏，確是别具風格的成就，已死的桃樂賽黛兒也演得還好，其餘諸人，只是平平而已。</p>
<h3>梅蕙絲還不走哩</h3>
<p>— 復</p>
<p>你們儘管猜想着那葫蘆式身體的女子，梅蕙絲在銀幕上還有多少時候可支持，但是梅蕙絲她自已，却並没有爲自已担憂。外間的一切揣測之詞，和批評她的話，她都聽見了。有人說她連演了三張片子，可是祇有第一張是成功的，因此她頂多再演一兩張片子，亦就可以告老還鄕了。可是她自已却自負得很。她說她的所以能够一登銀幕，就做明星，完全是因爲她是位「已成熟的藝術家，」而並不是偶然的成名。她或者一擊而中，或者完全失敗，但是她旣已擊中之後，難道她就不能維持下去了嗎？因此她覺得人家說她不久就不能立足於好萊塢，是没有理由的。但她現在已决定對於她以後所演的影片，和影片的數目，確要十二分的謹愼。當然梅蕙絲是位聰明過人的女子，她一定有她的妙法去維持她的地位也。</p>
<p>「滑頭碰滑頭」南京映吉士馬立斯决鬥的姿態。</p>
<h3>桃樂賽黛爾作古</h3>
<p>— 波兒</p>
<p>「死神都是逢三而行的。麗琳達許門和劉嘉岱已經是兩個了。不知道誰是第三個？」隱約還記得不久以前，桃樂賽在公司裏和人談着。那時就有人和她說「不要便是你吧。」「現在竟實現了。兩件事情發生相距只有十二個鐘點。</p>
<p>公司裏事情完後她想趕回去赴一個宴會，不幸在路上駕駛人失手，車子先碰在一塊大石頭，後來又碰到電綫木頭上，直滾了一百碼光景。車子才完全粉碎了。桃樂賽當塲重傷而死。駕駛人到醫院後六小時後也死了，他就是卡爾衛格納博士。</p>
<p>桃樂賽是最近發現的後起之秀。平常最歡歡喜和人開玩笑說死她說她不是溺死便是汽車闖禍而死。現在竟實踐了她的預言。她是一個天才演員，最近她的聲譽已經不亞於克勞黛考爾伯。這次她死了最傷心要算五歲大的蕭蕾騰波了，因爲和她合作了一部ＬittleＭissＭarkre竟混得很熟了。唉！有天才的人，老天總是不肯讓她長命的！</p>
<h3>銀色雜談</h3>
<p>— 白顰</p>
<p>明星們往往因列名間題而發生爭執，以爲自已的名字落了後，便認爲大羞辱了！</p>
<p>其實，這心理正和觀衆的心理相反。如果某明星佔了很重要的位置，甚至掛了領銜，那麽，觀衆對於某明星當特别注意了，如果成績好還可以。否則，以極大的希望注意，而結果竟使觀衆失望，所謂「希望愈大，其失望亦愈大」。那麽，某名星雖佔了列名上的優勢，而其成績不行，則雖「得」亦不足償「失」矣！</p>

<h3>佳兒佳婦（Born　to　be　Kissed）（十三）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>湯姆聽了他父親和憶迪爭辯的話，覺得憶迪以前和他所講的，頗有不實不盡的地方，於是就怒形於色的對着憶迪道：「你是騙我的……關於克新斯的出情……還有昨天晚上那個人，到底你們在一起有多久了？」這樣一來，憶迪再也不能忍受下去了。她一方面大哭，一方面狂喊道：「你們給我滾出去！」湯姆被她一喊，反而擺住不動了。於是憶迪又喊着：「快給我滾出去！」潘其先邁步走出去了。他回過頭來柔聲喊着湯姆道：「兒子，我們走吧。」湯姆没有法子，就跟了他的父親出來了。這裏留下憶迪一個人，在湯姆的背後狂呌着：「湯姆！湯姆！回來呀！我不要你走呀！」但是亦不知道湯姆聽見了没有，或者他聽見了理睬她。没有諒解。没有饒恕的話。没有回來的脚步聲。憶迪一個，心中充滿了悲思苦慮。在這悲思苦慮之中，她决定了一椿事……她是從此不談愛情了……她亦不再作好女子了……她一定要報仇……潘其必須受得相當的懲報！</p>
<p>湯姆自從跟了他的父親，從傑弗生萊市監獄裏出來之後，却不能很快的忘情於憶迪。後來他的父親勸他和他一同到倫敦去。他雖然無可無不可的答應了，但是等到那天他們父子二人上了船、正待出發的時候，湯姆突然告訴他父親道：「父親，我還要上岸去一次。我忘記了一件事了。」他的父親正要問他什麽事，他已經飛奔而去，從跳板上一直奔向岸上去了。他跑到岸上，喊了一輛汽車，將一張紙條交給了汽車夫。那汽車夫接過來一看，上面寫着「傑弗生萊市監獄」幾個字，覺得有些詫異的對湯姆望了一望，就將車開着去了。同時碼頭上又來了一輛汽車停住了。車門一開，跑出來的是却利，統納，他是來送行的。他出來了，回頭望着車廂裏兩個女子中的一個。她穿得很華麗，披着貴重的貂皮大衣，但是她面上露着不快活的神氣。統納對着那女子道：「憶迪，美麗的，你在車子裏等我好了。我一回兒就下來的。」她又望着那邊一個女子道：「吉弟，你陪着她。」他又拍着憶迪的大腿，好像憶迪已是他的人似的說道：「從這裏，我要帶你回家去了。」</p>
<p>憶迪好似胸有成竹似的默然看着他走開，一言不發。她吧……就跟他回家去吧……現在還在乎什麽呢？忽然她覺得眼前一亮，她看見了那天晚上在她房間裏，給她和那個不認識的男子拍照的人了。她霍的一下，從車子裏跳了出來。她追上去，將那個人的臂膀抱住了。她很熱切地和他耳語着。那人笑了。她就和他一同從跳板走了船了。這個時候，潘正和一般要人們談着話，還有許多新聞記者，和同來向他話别的朋友們。那個攝影師走到他前面道：「潘其先生，讓我給你拍張照，好不好！」潘其很高興的點了點頭。那攝影師又說道：「請你往左邊一些站着。」潘其亦答應了！就照他所指的地點站着，那個地方正在他包房的門前。然後那攝影師高聲喊道：「好了，潘其先生！」他似乎不用那麽高聲的。說時遲，那時快，他道麽一喊，潘其的臥房門開了！裏面跳了一個人來！（未完）</p>

<h3>Three-Nation Military Exercises</h3>
<p>Frequent Gunfire Creates Tense Atmosphere</p>
<p>American Troops to Proceed to Yuguan Soon</p>
<p>Sentries Deployed at All Barracks in Qinhuangdao</p>
<p>British Troops to Hold Second Exercise, with More Units Participating</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese garrison in Qinhuangdao has been conducting combat exercises outside their camp by the sea for several days. The participating troops include communications, medical, artillery, and infantry units. The exercises have been held for two days, from the 8th to the 9th. On the 9th, 240 American soldiers arrived in Qinhuangdao from Tianjin and coordinated with local American troops to conduct field exercises at 7:00 AM on the 10th. Additionally, a unit of French Annamese soldiers was also conducting target practice by the sea. Due to the military exercises of the three nations, the sound of gunfire was like firecrackers in Qinhuangdao, and the atmosphere was tense. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Two British submarines and one cruiser stationed in Qinhuangdao left port on the 9th for Weihaiwei. Currently, two British submarines and one cruiser are docked in that port. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The 15th Regiment of American troops stationed in Tianjin, consisting of 240 soldiers, 34 horses, two cannons, and twelve machine guns, boarded a North Ning Railway train this morning at 8:00 AM and departed for Qinhuangdao. They will conduct field exercises in the Yuguan area on the 15th, lasting a total of three days. They also plan to march to the Great Wall line. The second British military exercise in Qinhuangdao has not been scheduled yet and will be held after the French troops' exercise. More troops will participate than in the previous exercise, and detachments from the Tianjin and Beijing garrisons will be sent. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A certain important figure stated that the British, American, and French barracks in Yuguan are all referred to as fort command posts. Combat exercises have been held annually without notifying any party. The British barracks' rear wall is the Great Wall, and the area outside the wall is designated as a pseudo-border. British soldiers often go outside the city wall for target practice, and it is unreasonable to prohibit them from doing so today. Various countries are quite indignant about this. Therefore, sentries are stationed in front of each barracks, and security is very tight. Furthermore, Japanese soldiers are prohibited from passing through. American and French troops will also conduct exercises, following the usual practice of not notifying. This action is based on the Boxer Protocol, and the Japanese side can do nothing about it. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Huang Fu's Trip to Lushan</p>
<h3>To Return North Soon to Resume Post</h3>
<p>Huang Expected to Arrive at Kuling Last Night</p>
<p>Wang and Chiang Have Already Met Once</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu telegraphed Beiping on the 9th, stating that he would arrive in Beiping by the end of the month. It is reported that after Huang's trip to Lushan, he will return north via the Jinpu Railway to meet with Han Fuju, Yu Xuezhong, and others. Yin Tong is expected to accompany Huang north to resume his post. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Kuling Huang Fu arrived at Xun by Zhongshan warship from the west on the 9th and is expected to arrive at Xun around 7:00 PM on the 10th. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek sent Huang Jinjun, Director of the General Affairs Office of the Military Headquarters, to meet him. He will climb the mountain that evening and arrive at Kuling at 10:00 PM. It is reported that after meeting with Chiang and Wang, Huang will go to Beiping to preside over North China political affairs. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Kuling Huang Fu came west from Nanjing on the Zhongshan warship and is expected to arrive on the 10th evening. He will only stay in Kuling for two or three days. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Kuling After President Wang arrived at Kuling, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Yang Yongtai, Xiong Shihui, and others went to Wang's residence for talks, leaving after about an hour. Wang decided to go to Haihui Temple at 5:00 AM on the 10th to address the officer corps and return to Kuling that evening. According to Wang's remarks to the Central News Agency reporter at 8:00 PM on the 9th, he came at Chiang's invitation to give a speech to the officer corps and had no other mission. However, since he was already here, he would take the opportunity to discuss central government affairs with Chiang. As for what was discussed, he would disclose it later. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It was previously reported that Ambassadors Gu Weijun and Yan Huiqing would go to Lushan to lecture the officer corps on diplomacy. It is now known that there are no preparations for the trip. It is likely that Ambassadors Yan and Gu will prepare to return to their posts, or they may go to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for consultations. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang suggested that provincial and department offices merge and work together, and that this be tried first in the five bandit suppression provinces. If successful, it would be promoted further. It is reported that President Wang also quite agrees. He will have detailed discussions with Chairman Chiang during this trip to Jiangxi, and it will be submitted for discussion at the Fifth National Congress for implementation. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng</p>
<h3>Goes to Tianjin to Meet Yu Xuezhong</h3>
<p>Chai Shan Has Returned to Beiping from Tanggu</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng is going to Tianjin today to meet with Yu. He will return to Beiping in about a week and then go with Chai Shan to Malanyu to handle the handover with the Japanese representative Mamiya. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong stated that the date for the handover of Malanyu has not been determined because Yin Rugeng has not yet reported. The funds for the Qing Tombs Preservation Committee organized by our side will be paid from the land rent of the tomb area. The preservation committee will create a budget, estimating that it can generate 7,000 yuan per year, which will be sufficient for all expenses. The tomb-guarding police will be limited to 30 men and will not be increased in order to save expenses. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The handover of Malanyu has not been determined because Chai Shan has not yet received a response from the Kwantung Army headquarters, which is why Yin Rugeng has not yet come to Tianjin to ask for instructions on the management plan after the handover. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chai Shan went to Tanggu last night to pick up his family and arrived in Beiping this morning by the Ping Shen train. According to him, the British and Japanese troops in Yuguan have stopped their exercises. Commander Imamura of the Overseas Fleet came to Tianjin from Lushun but did not go to Yuguan. The issue of the war zone will be actively pursued after Huang Fu and Yin Tong go north, and the seven pending cases discussed in Dalian will be resolved separately. I have not gone to Malanyu for a long time to handle the handover. Dongfang will first hand over Duolun. There is talk of replacing Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi Akira, but I have not heard of it. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Ping Shen Train Service</p>
<h3>Delayed Arrival in Beiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Ping Shen train, which arrived in Beiping at 9:18 this morning, was delayed by 40 minutes. It is reported that when passing through Beidaihe, the coupling between the North Ning locomotive and the South Manchuria Railway carriage became detached due to uneven height, causing a 40-minute delay. Bandit activity is rampant between Liushouying and Beidaihe on the North Ning Railway. Each passenger train on the North Ning Ping Shen line has been assigned dozens of security guards to protect it.</p>
<p>The Issue of Special Police Deployment to Eastern Hebei</p>
<h3>Negotiations Temporarily Stalled</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong stated that the issue of deploying special police to eastern Hebei has been shelved. The Japanese side is most opposed to the proposed number of 9,000 personnel. It may be possible to manage with 6,000 personnel, and light machine guns will not be regarded as heavy weapons. However, this can only be decided after Chairman Huang returns. Our side believes that since the dispute has not been thoroughly resolved, it would be difficult to avoid restrictions if the deployment proceeds rashly. Therefore, it is not currently being actively pursued. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Bali Tai Incident in Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The directors of Guangrentang, which owns the land in Nan Kai Bali Tai, Tianjin, are of mixed quality. The director in charge of leasing land to the Japanese is Cai Detang. Other directors believe that Cai's behavior is wrong, and Wang Wendian, a standing committee member of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, is most strongly opposed to Cai. Recently, Wang has received multiple anonymous letters, warning that if he does not change his attitude, he will be treated with pistols and bombs. Wang is discouraged by this. Due to rain today, the Japanese side has suspended construction work in Bali Tai for one day. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Panchen Lama Leaves Beiping Today</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Panchen Lama stated that he will go to Suiyuan and Baotou tomorrow, then to Yimeng to chant sutras. He will leave Yimeng at the end of September for Xiangde in Qinghai. The date of return to Tibet will be decided temporarily after arriving in Qinghai. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xing Sa Ban Zhida arrived in Beiping this morning to visit the Panchen Lama, then entered Mongolia to escort him to Qinghai in the future. The Panchen Lama will leave Beiping tomorrow morning. The Panchen Lama has ordered 20 new cars, which are scheduled to be loaded onto trains tonight. All attendants are also scheduled to board the train tonight. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Belgian Government</p>
<h3>Confers Medal on Yu Xuezhong</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 6:00 PM on the 10th, Hebei Chairman Yu Xuezhong accepted the First Class Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold conferred by the Belgian Minister. Belgian Minister de Gielgud came to Tianjin this afternoon for the ceremony, which was held at the Belgian Consulate General in the French Concession. More than 40 dignitaries from Hebei Province and Tianjin City, as well as Belgian expatriates and foreign guests, attended. The ceremony was very simple. The Tianjin Consul General Schaer delivered a speech, and Yu Xuezhong responded. Then, the Belgian Minister attached the medal to Yu's sash, and they took a photo together before dispersing. After the ceremony, the Belgian Minister left Tianjin by night train to escape the summer heat in Beidaihe.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Belgian Minister de Gielgud went to Tianjin this morning to preside over the awarding ceremony for Yu Xuezhong. After the ceremony, he went to Beidaihe to escape the summer heat and is expected to return to Beiping at the end of the month. He will go to Tianjin again on the 10th of next month to welcome the Belgian special envoy to China, Johnson, who has already left Brussels and is coming to China via Siberia. He will arrive in Tianjin by boat from Vladivostok in early next month, arrive in Beiping on the 13th, and go to Beijing on the 16th to meet Chairman Lin. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Drawing Water from the Yellow River into the Huiji River</p>
<h3>Does Not Affect the Downstream</h3>
<p>(Kaifeng) The Fuyang branch of the Anhui Huai River Guiding Association previously heard that this province had a plan to draw water from the Yellow River into the Huiji River and was concerned that it would affect the downstream. It submitted a detailed statement of the advantages and disadvantages, requesting the authorities of this province to prevent its implementation. According to a person in charge of the Construction Department, the Huiji River project is a partial reorganization of the river channels in this province. The eight water suction pipes installed can draw 240 cubic feet of water per second. In addition to the water required by the Huiji River in Kaifeng, the remaining water is not enough to irrigate even a small portion of the farmland along the Huiji River that needs water. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission of the Huai River Guidance Commission has repeatedly sent experts to study it and believes that it will definitely not affect the downstream. The way the Jialu River and other river projects will be carried out is still under study. The design in the future will naturally be discussed with all relevant parties to ensure proper implementation. It will definitely not be done at the expense of the neighbor. The Construction Department has sent this opinion to the association. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Austrian Restoration Issue Remains</h3>
<p>For the past ten days, the issue of Austrian restoration has once again become a topic of much noise. The Austrian authorities have openly declared that the solution to the Austrian problem must be sought within the Habsburg imperial family, making their intention to restore the monarchy clearly visible. According to European dispatches, Italy's attitude towards this issue also indicates active assistance. Archduke Otto, residing in Belgium, is also eager to try, and there are rumors of a visit to Rome. Observing these three parties, the Austrian restoration issue seems to have progressed further than in the Dollfuss era.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the increasingly heated nature of this issue is due to Germany's attitude. However, whether Austria's restoration can stem Germany's eastward advance is a major question. Aside from observing the future evolution of events, it is unlikely that anyone can make a prediction. Judging from historical facts, if the Austrian restoration succeeds, Hitler will suffer a major blow. The Habsburg imperial family has traditionally held great prestige among the Germanic peoples, having historically been their leaders. In the 18th century, the kingdoms and principalities of the Germanic peoples on the east bank of the Rhine numbered no fewer than three hundred, with Austria as their ally. After being ravaged by Napoleon's iron heel, they united into thirty-eight states, forming the German Confederation, with Austria still as the leader. Only after the Austro-Prussian War did its leadership position decline, and the prestige of the Habsburg imperial family in Germany was replaced by the Hohenzollern royal family of Prussia. It seems that the current Austrian and Italian authorities are trying to use the past prestige of the Habsburg royal family to carry out a Germanic national fragmentation movement centered on Austria. Those likely to merge with Austria are Bavaria and other places in southern Germany adjacent to Austria. The Germans in these areas are all Catholics, religiously consistent with Austria. If they can be incorporated into Austria, it would weaken Germany's existing power. Judging from the Nazi Party's oppression of Catholics, once the Habsburg restoration succeeds, the return of southern Germany to Austria is not without possibility. Furthermore, after the Habsburg restoration, it could indirectly induce a German restoration, thereby undermining Hitler's rule in Germany. Thirdly, the Habsburg imperial family's historical tendency does not advocate German unification, so the restoration aims to preserve the separation of Germany and Austria. Observing these three effects, the Austrian restoration can indeed inflict significant blows on Hitler. However, given the current strong desire for great unification among the entire Germanic people, whether the fragmentation movement can achieve its wish remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Furthermore, whether this issue can be realized depends on the efforts of the Austrian and Italian authorities, but the key lies in the attitude of the Little Entente countries. According to the pre-war system, the Austrian imperial family was not only the royal family of Hungary, but also the ruler of all of Czechoslovakia and parts of Yugoslavia and Romania. The current Austrian restoration, is it a simple restoration of Austria, or a restoration of Hungary as well? This is a major question. If the restoration is limited to Austria, the power will not be great, and the threat to the Little Entente will not be great either. If the two countries, according to pre-war methods, jointly recognize a monarch and carry out a restoration, the momentum will be greater, and the Little Entente will inevitably be afraid. Moreover, whether the Habsburg imperial family, before the restoration, can recognize the Treaty of Saint-Germain and the Treaty of Trianon, which disposed of Austro-Hungarian lands, is of great importance. If it does not recognize it beforehand, it will inevitably take the recovery of pre-war lost territories as its mission after the restoration, which would endanger the existence of emerging countries such as Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia. Therefore, the Austrian restoration issue must take the Habsburg imperial family's recognition of the above two treaties as a prerequisite, otherwise it will inevitably be opposed by the Little Entente, which will then affect France's attitude. Judging from recent European dispatches, France and the Little Entente are both expressing opposition to this matter, so Italy's attitude has also suddenly turned negative. From this, it can be seen that although this issue has become widely known, whether it can become a reality is still an unknown number.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Silver Policy</h3>
<p>Aimed at stabilizing prices and protecting foreign trade</p>
<p>Nationalization of silver is very helpful in adjusting the value of the currency</p>
<p>Aiming to achieve a three-to-one silver-to-gold ratio in monetary reserves</p>
<p>Abroad, it has caused fears of U.S. currency inflation</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told reporters today, explaining President Roosevelt's executive order on the nationalization of silver, that the government's move was merely exercising its right of eminent domain. Stock exchange sources said the government wants to actively implement a silver purchase program to respond to calls for inflation. Thomas, the leader of the silver faction, welcomed this announcement, saying that the world's gold-using countries could be overthrown as a result, and a new monetary system and an era of new prosperity would begin from now on. The United States has decided to use more silver coins, which will encourage other countries to adopt the same policy. The U.S. government still needs to buy 1 billion ounces of silver to meet the ratio set by Congress. This order directly declares that the world does not have enough gold to meet currency needs, so it has to turn to silver. (9th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Proclamation of Silver Nationalization</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt's proclamation on the nationalization of silver states that the U.S. policy is to increase the ratio of silver to gold in U.S. monetary reserves in order to achieve the ultimate goal of a three-to-one silver-to-gold ratio in monetary reserves. The Treasury Department will maintain a 100% silver reserve for the silver certificates it issues. Silver certificates and legal tender for public and private use can be exchanged for standard U.S. dollars upon request. All silver must be delivered to the mint within ninety days, except for domestic and foreign silver coins and ingots, silver owned by foreign governments and foreign central banks, and silver in metal composite products. In the preamble to his proclamation, President Roosevelt said that it is now necessary to seek to increase and stabilize domestic prices and protect U.S. foreign trade to counteract the adverse effects of foreign currency depreciation. (9th Reuters)</p>
<h3>U.S. Treasury Secretary Issues Statement</h3>
<p>(Washington) The United States suddenly nationalized silver at a price of 50.01 cents per ounce. President Roosevelt ordered the implementation of this this morning under Section 7 of the Silver Act. Tonight, the whole world is paying attention to the Treasury Department's subsequent actions. Various parties have been inquiring with the Treasury Department for the truth. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau has not made any statements, so outsiders can only speculate on their own as to whether this move by the government will have an inflationary effect. According to the Treasury Secretary's statement to the press, a few points are quite important:</p>
<p>(1) The 50% silver transaction profit tax stipulated by the Silver Act is now exempt when silver is nationalized and delivered to the mint.</p>
<p>(2) The price of raw silver remains at 64.5 cents per ounce.</p>
<p>(3) The price of the new currency will be determined based on the price purchased after nationalization, but the Treasury Department will set the price of silver at US$1.2929 per ounce.</p>
<p>(4) Regulations for short-term sales and forward transactions will be announced within a few days.</p>
<p>It is said that this plan was completed a few days ago, but the Treasury Secretary suddenly implemented it this morning. Before issuing the order, the Treasury Secretary telephoned President Roosevelt in Green Bay to ask for instructions, which was approved. (9th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Congressional Silver Faction Satisfied</h3>
<p>(Washington) Congressional leaders today all endorsed President Roosevelt's order nationalizing silver. Senators and representatives who were active on currency issues in the last session of Congress said that this move is not an inflationary policy. Democratic Senator Fuller, who is the chairman of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, said that the nationalization of silver will slightly inflate the currency. He believes that this move can increase both prices and securities prices. Senator Thomas, the leader of the inflation faction, further said that this move is a necessary path for the government to implement the policies set by Congress. Thomas said that this move by the President will have a great impact and will be of great assistance in adjusting U.S. currency policy and the value of the U.S. dollar. (9th National Telegram)</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Borah of Idaho gave a speech here today, advocating that the government establish a central bank to control the national currency. Borah was the leader of the silver faction during the last session of Congress. (9th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Differing Interpretations from Various Parties</h3>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt's executive order today to nationalize silver at a price of 50.01 cents per ounce has been interpreted differently by various parties. The silver faction believes that this move can increase purchasing power in the Far East, but others say that increasing the purchasing power of silver coins will have a contractionary effect in Eastern countries. It is expected that open silver market transactions in the United States will be temporarily suspended as a result. After the order was issued, there was a large-scale sell-off today. Financial circles said that this move by the government indicates its intention to more actively implement the silver policies contained in the Silver Act of 1934. According to general opinion, the U.S. Treasury Department will temporarily purchase more silver, and world silver prices will also rise, because foreign markets will see active buying. (9th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Preparation for Possible Inflation</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt issued an order to implement the Silver Act, nationalizing silver. According to political circles, Roosevelt's decision focuses on achieving psychological effects, because even if the actual silver reserve increases as a result, it will not immediately reach 25%. However, Roosevelt decided to exercise the power given to him by the Silver Act, so that the inflation faction could be partially satisfied, because most senators from agricultural areas are inflationists, who believe that the U.S. dollar has not been sufficiently devalued and want to legally complete the price of the U.S. dollar at 50 cents, according to the amendment proposed by Thomas. But the general public believes that Roosevelt will not immediately enter the path of inflation. This order is just a trial of the situation, and its effect will certainly not be as great as expected by some inflationists. (9th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) The London Financial Times said today that President Roosevelt's opinion on the U.S. dollar is still kept secret, but his silver policy is indeed a preparation for future inflation. The most important impact of President Roosevelt's silver announcement is that foreign observers are concerned that the United States will continue to take inflationary actions. Now it is felt that their concerns are not unfounded. The Daily Mail also said that this U.S. policy is indeed a kind of inflation, but its scope has not reached a very large or alarming degree. However, the Exchange Telegraph said that London operators do not hold the view that this order by the United States is a sign of a new inflationary move. (10th Reuters)</p>
<h3>World Markets Fluctuate</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's order to nationalize silver had repercussions around the world today, and Washington officials are silently observing its impact. The official arena continuously received reports of disturbances from London, Mumbai, Shanghai, and other important silver markets, but did not issue any opinions. A London telegram reported that China was selling off in large quantities, exceeding the number purchased by London from India. Therefore, London brokers said that if the United States does not assist the market, silver prices will tend to fall. The fluctuations in Mumbai were very large, buying interest was very strong, silver prices soared, and there is a tendency to continue to rise. Silver mining stocks on the London Stock Exchange rose sixpence. New York merchants, however, considered this insignificant and said that its inflationary power will soon disappear. (10th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>How Much Silver is Being Purchased is Unknown</h3>
<p>(Washington) How much silver the U.S. Treasury Department has recently purchased in the world market is unknown to outsiders. According to estimates, it is about 100 million ounces, and the Treasury Department has also received about 26 million ounces of silver from other sources. Today, Treasury Department personnel claimed that this new order could allow the Treasury Department to purchase at least another 45 million ounces. (9th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, people in the London silver market asked each other, "Will the United States buy silver here?" When the news of the United States buying silver was announced, many people in the silver industry were pleased and estimated that the United States had silver reserves ranging from 100 million to 300 million ounces. However, in any case, if the United States wants to implement its silver program, it needs about 1.3 billion ounces of silver. Therefore, many people believe that the United States will inevitably buy silver abroad, in which case silver prices will inevitably rise. However, some people in the silver industry also said that the U.S. government has limited people in the country to hand over their silver reserves within 50 days, so the United States may not purchase in large quantities before November. The news that President Roosevelt has decided to nationalize silver did not have a direct impact, but the indirect impact was the weakness of the U.S. dollar, the popularity of gold mining stocks, and the rise in the prices of goods, because it is feared that there will be a devaluation of the currency after the nationalization of silver. The general opinion is that the greatest impact is the awakening of the psychology of inflation. (10th Reuters)</p>
<h3>New York Silver Trading Suspended</h3>
<p>(Washington) After the government announced this news, the commodities market immediately suspended trading in silver futures. The silver price at the mint was set at 50.001 cents, which will deduct the minting tax of 61 and 25/8%, and then give the silver owner silver certificates or other currency. This order does not apply to domestically mined silver after December 21 of last year, because this silver can still be sent to the mint in accordance with President Roosevelt's proclamation of December 21. (9th Reuters)</p>
<h3>French Monetary Policy Remains Unshaken</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French official arena did not express surprise at the U.S. nationalization of silver. The general public believes that this move will not hinder the current policies of the gold bloc countries. Therefore, French financial policy and current international settlement methods will not be inconvenienced. The silver nationalization policy may not be another step for U.S. President Roosevelt to lower the price of the U.S. dollar. Moreover, the amount of silver France stores in the United States is extremely small. Therefore, it can be determined that the U.S. silver nationalization policy will not have an impact in France.

<h3>U.S. Mining Industry Still Unprofitable</h3>
<p>Reno, silver mining industry people in Nevada, USA, expressed the opinion that the nationalization of silver has not had a good impact on the Nevada silver industry, because the set price is lower than the price of newly mined silver announced last December. As far as is currently known, Nevada does not store physical silver. Today, the secretary of the Nevada Miners' Association told a Reuters reporter that President Roosevelt's announcement has given the Silver Miners' Association the recognition it wanted. Nevada miners hope that the silver price will be 80 cents or more per ounce, because only at this price can the exploitation of low-grade silver mines be profitable. Currently, this type of silver mine has stopped working. (9th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japan Not Greatly Affected</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Vice Minister of Finance Tsushima spoke as follows regarding U.S. President Roosevelt's announced nationalization of silver:</p>
<p>The purpose of silver nationalization is to increase the value of silver and, due to the demands of inflationists, to be a currency reserve. Also, due to various circumstances such as the recent poor economic situation and the approaching election of councilors, silver nationalization was announced. However, the impact on Japan is not great. However, if the United States implements an inflationary policy, the value of gold may be forced down to an extreme, so changes in its currency system should be noted. (10th Dempo)</p>
<h3>Bank of England</h3>
<p>Highest Record of Banknote Issuance</p>
<p>Significant Reflection of Business Recovery</p>
<p>(London) The Bank of England's banknote issuing department exceeded £392 million in the week ending August 8, which is the highest record ever. The increase in the amount of banknotes issued was due to holiday needs. This can be regarded as a clear sign of the increase in the spending power of the British people. The London Times said today that the above figures are a significant reflection of the British business recovery. (10th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Speech</h3>
<p>Continuing to Promote the New Deal</p>
<p>Increasing Wealth Through Cooperative Action</p>
<p>Seeking the Happiness of the People of the Country</p>
<p>Green Bay: On his way back from touring Hawaii, President Roosevelt delivered his first important speech today, forcefully saying that the government has decided to proceed with its current plans, and that in terms of finance, the government is implementing its "golden rule." Those protected by the government are not only homeowners who are free from the danger of enclosed properties, but also small property owners, depositors, and investors, who can now rest easy. When the President spoke of the people's gradual restoration of confidence in the New Deal, he cited agricultural programs, the industrial programs of the National Recovery Administration, and the government's relief programs, and recognized that they were sufficient to restore the nation's belief and courage. The President also said that the New Deal, which cracks down on harming others for one's own benefit, will continue to be promoted, but said that the government does not want to hinder honest commerce, nor does it intend to take from one and give to the other. The government's sole purpose is to increase wealth through cooperative action and to share it with the people of the country. (9th National News Agency)</p>
<h3>Our Observation Mission</h3>
<p>Visiting the Italian Airfield</p>
<p>Rome: The Chinese Aviation Observation Mission has now arrived in Italy. Today, they visited the experimental department of the Montecelio Airfield.

<p>Banquet Visits Every Day</p>
<p>Turin, Italy: The Soviet Russian aviation delegation that came to Italy yesterday came here from Rome today to visit various aircraft manufacturing plants. In the afternoon, they were hosted by the city hall, and returned to Rome that night. (9th Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today at noon, the Military Club hosted a banquet for the Soviet Russian aviators who arrived here yesterday, presided over by Minister of Aviation General Denain. French officials, both civil and military, who accompanied the seat included representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and officers and technicians who had accompanied former Minister of Aviation Cot to the Soviet Union last year. At the end of the banquet, General Denain addressed the guests, first explaining the relationship between the Russian and French aviation circles, and then saying that the Russian aviation circles had ascended to the stratosphere and made various famous flights, which were admirable. The Soviet Russian chargé d'affaires gave a reply, saying that Russia and France both aim to maintain European security, and are cooperating with each other to seek peaceful development. Finally, the director of the Soviet Russian Civil Aviation, General Ensherithoff, spoke, briefly saying that the reason why the Soviet Union is promoting aviation is due to the lack of roads. From an economic and national defense point of view, it is also necessary. He then said that he was very grateful for the kind hospitality of the French aviation circles and the Paris City Hall during this visit. (9th Havas)</p>
<h3>Admiral Osumi Criticizes</h3>
<p>British and American Naval Claims</p>
<p>Opposes Proportionalism</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Admiral Osumi went to the Nasu Imperial Villa on the 9th to meet with the Emperor and reported on the naval situation. After that, he returned to Tokyo in the same car with Prime Minister Okada. On the issue of arms reduction in the car, the Admiral said that Prime Minister Okada had stated that he opposed proportionalism, and that he held the same opinion. U.S. Admiral Pratt argued for proportionalism on the grounds that Japan is only located on one shore in the Orient, while the United States is between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and has a very long coastline. This kind of argument may be considered reasonable by ordinary people, but from the perspective of experts, it has no practical basis. War is decided when the forces of the two countries meet in one place. It is most important to consider these various occasions and decide on national defense power. The United Kingdom also advocates proportionalism because it has colonies overseas, but if the United Kingdom loses its colonies, it can still recover the lost land if it wins the final battle. Therefore, the problem of protecting overseas colonies can be achieved by maritime police. Their advocacy of proportionalism is nothing more than wanting to maintain a naval force larger than other countries. The purpose of arms reduction conferences can only be achieved if the largest military power sacrifices the most military equipment. (10th Domei)</p>

<p>The Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Military</p>
<h3>Contending for Supervisory Power over the Puppet Regime</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of unifying and strengthening the resident organs in Manchuria, negotiations have been conducted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Army, the Colonization Ministry, and related ministries, and there is a growing trend towards concrete progress. The Army's intention is that this reform of the organs should first determine its fundamental principles. Therefore, the fundamental methods of its reform plan are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The roots of the current resident organs in Manchuria are the Plenipotentiary Ambassador, the Commander of the Army, and the Governor-General of Kwantung. This tripartite system should be changed to a dual system of the Plenipotentiary Ambassador and the Commander of the Army, abolishing the Governor-General of Kwantung. Since the current state of "Manchukuo" has been based on the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol, the primary goal should be joint defense and ensuring public security between Japan and Manchukuo. Therefore, the Commander of the Kwantung Army should concurrently serve as the Plenipotentiary Ambassador. The Plenipotentiary Ambassador should be under the direct supervision of the Prime Minister, but regarding purely diplomatic affairs, he should still be under the supervision of the Minister of Foreign Affairs as before. As for the Commander of the Army, he should be under the supervision of the Minister of the Army regarding items related to commanding military orders and the issue of public security in "Manchukuo".</p>
<p>However, the opinion of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is that regarding the dual system of the Commander of the Army and the Plenipotentiary Ambassador, specifically the Commander of the Army concurrently serving as the Plenipotentiary Ambassador, they do not object. However, regarding the issue of supervisory power, they believe that the Plenipotentiary Ambassador should still be under the command and supervision of the Minister of Foreign Affairs as before. Thus, the authorities of the Army and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are in a mutually conflicting situation regarding fundamental principles. However, if the reform plan resulting from this dual system is decided based on these principles, it would be easy to resolve. If the Army and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs each insist on their own views on the above issues, and fail to reach a consensus on future negotiations, the outcome may be that the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, and the Army Minister organize a three-minister meeting, and make a decision based on the policy towards Manchuria and the overall interests of the nation. Indeed, there is no other way. Furthermore, the Army's argument for placing the Plenipotentiary Ambassador under the direct supervision of the Prime Minister is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The relationship between "Manchukuo" and Japan, based on the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol, has an inseparable special relationship in terms of national defense and diplomacy. At the same time, there is also an inseparable close relationship in terms of industrial development and all other facilities. Therefore, for the sake of the coexistence and co-prosperity of the two countries, it is necessary to provide great assistance. Its diplomatic relations with other countries are completely different. (2) The diplomacy of "Manchukuo" must simultaneously consider Japan's diplomatic policy. The scope of purely diplomatic affairs executed by the Plenipotentiary Ambassador is extremely narrow, and there is a close relationship with the Japanese Ministry of Colonization, Agriculture and Forestry, Commerce and Industry, and Railways in the development of industry, economy, railways, and other various aspects. In these various relationships, placing the Plenipotentiary Ambassador under the supervision of the Prime Minister to unify and strengthen the relationship with Japan is considered appropriate and convenient for the development of "Manchukuo" and the implementation of Japan's policy towards Manchuria.</p>
<p>(3) As for changing the title of the Plenipotentiary Ambassador to the Plenipotentiary Representative in Manchuria, it is believed that the current title is not very appropriate when "Manchukuo" establishes diplomatic relations with other countries in the future. Therefore, the title is being considered this time. If it is considered appropriate, please change it. Otherwise, it is also acceptable to keep the current title of Plenipotentiary Ambassador.

<p>British Industrial Representatives</p>
<h3>To Visit the Puppet State for Inspection</h3>
<p>Stating it's a Private Action</p>
<p>(London) The Federation of British Industries decided today to send an industrial delegation to "Manchukuo" in the near future to inspect everything and ascertain whether the British industrial sector can fully cooperate with the local industrial sector to develop various businesses. The delegation will also make a short trip to Japan to establish friendly contacts with Japanese industrial and commercial representative groups. The delegation will consist of Sir Barnes, director of Lloyds Bank and Commercial Union Assurance Company, Sir Seligman, director of Seligman Brothers, several bankers, one member of the Advisory Committee of the Export Credits Guarantee Department, Mr. Rogerson, director of the Federation of British Industries, and Mr. Bigood, representative of the British Iron and Steel Federation. Mr. Bigood was born in Japan. (8th day, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Government officials today declared regarding the industrial delegation's visit to "Manchukuo" for inspection that the delegation will receive various legitimate assistance from the British government. The delegation is now scheduled to depart at the end of the month to investigate the situation of opening up new markets. It is also heard that the delegation has reported to the government, stating that this trip is purely a private action of a commercial nature. As for whether British private debt lending to "Manchukuo" conflicts with the non-recognition policy passed by the League of Nations, responsible parties stated that the government naturally considers this loan not to be of a political nature, but the Treasury Department has the right to decide on this issue afterwards. (10th day, National News)</p>
<p>(London) The Federation of British Industries has decided to send an industrial inspection delegation to "Manchukuo" in the near future, as reported in the previous telegram. Recently, The Times and the Morning Post have both published commentaries. The Times stated, "The fact that the industrial sector has taken this action shows that they are not unaware that there are new markets to be found in the Far East. We anticipate that after the inspection delegation travels to Japan, they will be able to take the opportunity to inspect major commercial centers in China and establish friendly contacts with leaders in the Chinese business and financial sectors. The main task of the inspection delegation is to examine the extent to which British commerce and finance can assist the development of "Manchukuo". Under the current circumstances, there are various benefits to British banks cooperating with the Japanese. If British and Japanese industrialists can cooperate sincerely, the positive impact will not be limited to "Manchukuo". It is no exaggeration to say that the entire Far East will benefit from it." The Morning Post also had the same opinion, stating, ""Manchukuo" is rich in resources, and its economic development will be very rapid. The British inspection delegation's trip will certainly be welcomed by the emperor and government of "Manchukuo". If this is the case, it will be beneficial to both parties. Furthermore, the inspection delegation will travel from Manchuria to Japan, which shows that our people do not pay much attention to the so-called threat that Japan poses to British commerce, and instead recognize that Anglo-Japanese friendship is the greatest benefit to Britain in the Far East. If Britain and Japan can adopt common solutions to common problems, the friendship between the two countries will be further consolidated. The inspection delegation is heading to the Far East with this spirit, and its future political and economic gains will benefit both countries." (10th day, Havas)</p>
<p>Sino-Soviet Railway Negotiations</p>
<h3>Russia Rejects Japanese Proposal</h3>
<p>Insisting on Original Claims</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Yurenev, visited Foreign Minister Hirota at 3:30 PM on the 10th, stating briefly that he had received the final compromise proposal for the Sino-Soviet Railway sale negotiations submitted by the Foreign Minister on the 30th of last month, requesting further consideration. He then requested instructions from his home government and received a reply today, stating that the Soviet government still feels that the proposal submitted on the 30th of last month is extremely appropriate and requests that the Foreign Minister convey to "Manchukuo" to make further concessions to bring it closer to the Soviet position, and requests continued mediation. This did not touch on the Foreign Minister's final mediation plan at all. The Foreign Minister said that if his mediation is not accepted, he will resign from his position as mediator and requests direct negotiations with "Manchukuo", which he had stated before. However, the Soviet side still hopes that the Foreign Minister will mediate. Therefore, Foreign Minister Hirota replied in a stern tone, saying that if the Soviet government is unwilling to accept his final compromise plan and is proposing a new plan, he absolutely cannot agree. However, at this time, he still hopes to make concessions to improve the relationship between Japan, Manchukuo, and the Soviet Union. If he still conveys this matter to "Manchukuo" today, he will still insist on the mediation plan in his position as mediator and will strive to the end to uphold the principles expressed in the final proposal. If it is not recognized, there will be no other way but direct negotiations.</p>
<p>In addition, various situations were discussed. From this, it can be seen that the Sino-Soviet Railway sale negotiations are still in a state of back-and-forth. If the Soviet Union continues to maintain its tough attitude, the negotiations may even break down, and its future is quite bleak. (10th day, Japanese United News)</p>
<p>Dissolution of Austrian Social Democratic Stormtroopers</p>
<h3>Another Expression of German Compromise Towards Austria</h3>
<p>Cabinet to Be Changed Soon</p>
<p>Vice Chancellor Goering Most Likely</p>
<p>Munich The headquarters of the Austrian National Socialist Party here was closed today. This is the second move by German Chancellor Hitler to appease the Austrians. The first move was to ban official sponsorship of anti-Austrian radio propaganda. (9th day, Reuters)</p>
<p>Munich German authorities today issued an order to dissolve the Austrian National Socialist stormtroopers. Upon the issuance of this order, the stormtrooper camps will be dismantled one after another, and all members will be demobilized, which can be completed within a week. This can be regarded as another clear indication of Germany's adoption of a new compromise policy towards Austria. It is also the actual effect of the unanimous condemnation of Germany by world public opinion after the murder of Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss. All parties are therefore optimistic about the future of the European situation. Chancellor Hitler's anger towards France and the open expression of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, although seemingly indifferent, are actually concerned about the increasing backlash from various countries. Therefore, his policy towards Austria is gradually becoming more moderate. The actual number of Austrian National Socialist stormtroopers has not been disclosed to the outside world, but it is known that approximately 15,000 to 20,000 troops are stationed in barracks, mostly on the border between Austria and Bavaria. (10th day, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German cabinet will be changed soon, but the official announcement will likely be made after the referendum on August 19th. The positions of Vice President and Deputy Prime Minister will likely be combined into one, and one person will be appointed to it, titled Deputy Head of the German Federation. Those who are expected to hold this position include Prussian Prime Minister and Minister of Aviation General Goering, Minister of Defense General Blomberg, and media mogul Hugenberg. Among them, General Goering is the most likely, because if General Blomberg holds this position, it will make the National Defense Forces too closely linked to politics. As for Hugenberg's rise to power, many of Hitler's party members regard it as an open victory for the right wing, so they do not approve of it. (9th day, Reuters)</p>

<p>Ministry of Industry Denies</p>
<h3>State-Run Shen Xin Textile Factory</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry issued a statement on the handling of the Shen Xin Textile Factory case, stating that the claim of nationalization is baseless rumors. Item 3 of the relief measures proposed by the Ministry, in which the government provides 3 million as operating capital, is specifically for maintaining the Shen Xin business for six months of working capital and does not include debt and has nothing to do with state-run operations. (10th day, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry instructed the Wuxi Textile Association regarding the handling of the Shen Xin Textile Factory case, stating that the Ministry previously received a report from Rong Zongjing, stating that the company's finances were exhausted and requesting that personnel be sent to investigate and provide prompt relief. The Ministry then immediately formulated a temporary plan: (1) the Executive Yuan should send a letter to the National Economic Commission to maintain the company and prevent it from stopping work; (2) the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry should send a letter to the National Economic Commission to send personnel to jointly investigate and formulate a relief plan to be implemented under government supervision. The Executive Yuan meeting approved and complied, and personnel were immediately sent to jointly investigate with personnel from the National Economic Commission and the Ministry of Finance. They jointly proposed a relief plan for approval. Subsequently, the personnel reported that they had estimated the company's assets and liabilities, and although the liabilities exceeded 5 million yuan, the actual amount that urgently needed to be repaid was more than that. They also submitted a written report for verification. After review, another relief plan was formulated: (1) the government should order the company to liquidate, with a deadline of six months. If liquidation fails, the government will send personnel to liquidate; (2) the government should convene creditors and organize a temporary management committee to operate the company's existing nine factories, with a deadline of six months. After six months, a specific plan will be determined based on the results of the reorganization; (3) during the temporary management committee's operation period, the government will provide 3 million yuan as operating capital. At the end of six months, all profits or losses will be calculated into the company's debt and credit, and submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval. However, because the company sent personnel to reorganize itself, a decision was not made. In summary, the Ministry's handling of this case has been based on the principle of supporting private enterprises, focusing on maintaining both the Shen Xin business and the rights of creditors. The official documents are clear and obvious. The claim of nationalization is entirely baseless rumors. At this time when the domestic textile industry is in danger, it is difficult to guarantee that there are no villains confusing the public. The reporters in this case have experience in handling social affairs and should weigh the facts and remain calm. How can they pick up rumors and make inquiries? As for the estimation of Shen Xin's assets, because the textile industry involves specialized technology, experts sent by the National Economic Commission conducted a detailed estimation during the investigation. According to the report, the estimated value is too low and a letter should be sent to investigate and reply. Also, Item 3 of the relief measures proposed by the Ministry, in which the government provides 3 million yuan as operating capital, is specifically for maintaining Shen Xin's business for six months of working capital and does not include debt, and has nothing to do with state-run operations. This is for your information. (10th day, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry recently issued a detailed reply to the Wuxi Textile Association's request for relief for the Shen Xin Textile Factory, stating that the Ministry's handling of this case has been based on the principle of supporting private enterprises, focusing on maintaining both the Shen Xin business and the rights of creditors. The claim of nationalization is entirely baseless rumors. (10th day, Central News Agency)</p>

Based on the "Provisional Regulations for Cracking Down on Water Adulteration of Cotton" promulgated by the National Government, the Political Reorganization Committee strictly ordered the five provinces and two municipalities to effectively crack down on this. Furthermore, the cotton production in western Hebei has always been abundant, and it can generate profits of 30 million yuan each year. However, due to the adulteration of water by unscrupulous merchants and improper transportation and sales methods, it has plummeted. Recently, the North China Rural Improvement Society, composed of the School of Economics of Nankai University, the Jin Cheng Bank, and the Ding County People's Education Promotion Association, discussed ways to improve cotton at Beiping, and decided to train 60 instructors to specialize in the development of western Hebei cotton. Large warehouses will be built in five counties along the Hutuo River, with complete equipment for compressing and packaging cotton. At the same time, farmers' loans will be offered at an annual interest rate of 8%. In the future, the warehouse will purchase and sell the cotton after the harvest. In addition, 500 mu of land will be allocated in Ding County as a cotton seed experimental area. (10th day, Central News Agency)</p>

<p>Facts: Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi joined the Communist Party in 1920, and were appointed by the Third International as Standing Committee Members of the Chinese Communist Party, with Chen Duxiu concurrently serving as Secretary. They jointly executed the strategies instructed by the Third International, leading party members in activities in mainland China. Later, the party split into Stalinist and Trotskyist factions. Power was entirely controlled by the Stalinist faction. Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi, because they were inclined towards the Trotskyist faction, were removed from their positions by the Third International in 1927, and expelled from the party in 1929. They then gathered comrades in Shanghai to secretly organize the Chinese Communist Party Left Opposition (hereinafter referred to as the CCP Opposition). Their goal was to unite workers, students, and peasants to organize a Soviet government and oppose the Stalinist faction's use of bandits and defeated soldiers to lead peasant uprisings in China. They compiled various writings, or issued various publications in the name of the CCP Opposition, and spread various leaflets in the name of resisting Japan, propagating the faction's doctrines in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hong Kong, and other places, hoping to overthrow the National Government and organize a Soviet government under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Wang Wu, Pu Yifan, and Wang Zhaoqun were all organizational members of the CCP Opposition, and Wang Wu and Pu Yifan were promoted to be alternate members of the Central Executive Committee of the faction. Guo Jinghao joined the CCP Opposition in 1929 and was responsible for organizational work and student movements. On October 15, 1932, Peng Shuzhi, Pu Yifan, Wang Wu, Wang Zhaoqun, and Xie Shaoshan were holding a regular weekly meeting at Xie Shaoshan's home, No. 210, Chunyang Lane, Dong Youheng Road, Shanghai. After the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau received a tip-off, it immediately sent personnel to Chunyang Lane with the police to arrest Peng Shuzhi and others on the spot. They then went to various places to arrest Chen Duxiu and Guo Jinghao, along with the propaganda documents and books they had seized, and transferred them to the Shanghai High Court Second Branch, which transferred them to the Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>Reasons: In the investigation and in the original court, Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi fully confessed how they joined the Communist Party, how they were appointed by the Third International as Standing Committee Members of the Chinese Communist Party, how they were removed from their positions and party membership by the Third International because they were inclined towards the Trotskyist faction, how they organized the Chinese Communist Party Left Opposition in Shanghai, and how they propagated their doctrines to workers, students, and other groups, hoping to overthrow the National Government and establish a Soviet regime under the dictatorship of the proletariat. What should be investigated is whether the faction has disturbed public order in addition to propaganda work, and whether it mutually supports the Stalinist faction in mainland China. Therefore, this court investigated Chen Duxiu's edited "Proletarian" and "Regarding the So-Called Red Army Problem," which stated that "The communist parties of dozens of countries around the world have always followed Engels's teachings and dare not adopt the policy of using vagrant proletarians (referring to bandits and defeated soldiers). Now the traitors of the Chinese workers' movement, Li Lisan, Xiang Zhongfa, Zhou Enlai, etc., (all of the Third International Stalinist faction) are using this kind of vagrant proletariat as guards and pillars, simply treating them as the main force of the proletarian revolutionary movement, attempting to expand and rely on the so-called Red Army based on the vagrant proletariat to lead peasants in guerrilla warfare. Except for being defeated, bought off, disintegrated by internal strife by the ruling class, or gradually compromising with the rural bourgeoisie and becoming their White Army, they cannot have other prospects." In the first volume, fourth issue of Spark, Peng Shuzhi's article "The Stalinists have an Estimate of the Manchurian Incident and the Crisis of the Anti-Japanese Movement" stated, "The Stalinist faction only trusts the Red Army, believing that with the Red Army, they can conquer the world. The armed struggle of peasants in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi is a fact, but they neglect the urban workers' movement and place all their illusions and hopes on these armed peasants. This is the main reason why they have been stuck in a dead end for several years." Their attack on the Stalinist faction in China, that it should not use vagrants to lead peasant uprisings, is clearly expressed. Furthermore, Chen Duxiu confessed, "The Red Army should be purely organized by workers and peasants after the establishment of the Soviet government and should not be mixed with bandits. Moreover, there is no need for a Red Army now." Peng Shuzhi confessed, "We advocate that the Red Army should be purely organized by workers and peasants, and we do not advocate that there be bandits in the Red Army. We believe that there is no need for a Red Army now, and it is necessary to wait until the Soviet government is established before organizing a Red Army." It is clear that Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi not only stand in opposition to the Stalinist faction in mainland China, but also that their method of activity, in addition to propaganda work, does not currently involve disturbing public order. This can also be confirmed. As for whether their propaganda writing reaches the level of treason, it is also a question that should be studied in this case. The publications edited by Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi and issued in the name of the CCP Opposition are as many as over a hundred kinds, none of which do not contain writing that opposes the current state of the country and opposes the National Government. The most prominent publications, such as "Spark," "Campus Life," "Proletarian," "Hot Lake," and various leaflets distributed in the name of resisting Japan, as well as political resolutions issued in the name of the CCP Opposition, either state that the Outline of National Reconstruction is not applicable to China and should be torn up, or state that the National Government is organized by the bourgeoisie and should be overthrown. Peeking at their intentions, it is nothing more than wanting to completely destroy the current state of the country and reorganize a Soviet government under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Its ability to shake the foundations of the country is evident. According to the legislative intent of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Acts Endangering the Republic, it cannot be said that it is not treason propaganda. Furthermore, the foundation of a nation is based on sovereignty, and the sovereignty of the Republic of China belongs to the people. All citizens of the Republic of China, without distinction of gender, race, religion, or class, are equal under the law. Articles 2 and 6 of the Provisional Constitution stipulate this. In contrast, the Soviet system only entrusts its sovereignty to the special class of peasants and workers, and cannot be compared to it. Chen Duxiu and others advocate that apart from changing from a democracy to an imperial system, which is treasonous, the organization of the Soviet regime has nothing to do with the essence of the founding of the Republic of China, which is particularly far-fetched. The original trial's finding that Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi organized a group with the purpose of endangering the Republic and used writing to promote treason is correct. However, the original trial sentenced Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi, who were inclined towards the Trotskyist faction and opposed the Stalinist faction's use of bandits and defeated soldiers to lead peasant armed uprisings, to thirteen years of imprisonment each, considering that they had no self-interest and were still scholars who were deeply thoughtful and painstaking, which is somewhat severe. Generally, Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi's appeal argues that the original judgment was improper based on legal opinions, which is insufficient to be accepted, but their statement of disagreement is not without reason. Furthermore, Wang Wu only admitted that he had previously joined the Communist Party and had been sentenced to six years of imprisonment by the Shanghai Provisional Military Court, and that after being released on bail, he became an alternate member of the Central Standing Committee of the CCP Opposition and participated in regular weekly meetings, which he completely denied. Pu Yifan also admitted after being arrested that he had organized the Communist Party and served as an alternate member of the Central Standing Committee of the CCP Opposition. However, Wang Wu and Pu Yifan were at Xie Shaoshan's home, No. 210, Chunyang Lane, Dong Youheng Road, Shanghai, on October 15, 1932, holding a regular weekly meeting with Peng Shuzhi, Wang Zhaoqun, and Xie Shaoshan, and were arrested on the spot. This is an undeniable fact. Furthermore, Xie Shaoshan testified in the Shanghai Public Concession Police Department, "This place is often used as a meeting place. The Standing Committee includes five members: Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, Pu Yifan, Luo Shifan, and Song Fengchun (referring to Wang Wu). The last one had just been released from Caohejing Prison. This was the first time he had participated in the meeting. On the day I was arrested, they were holding a regular weekly meeting." When questioned by the judge of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, "What kind of organization is your place?" she replied, "My place is the Trotskyist leadership organization." When asked, "Where do you hold your meetings?" she replied, "We hold them every Saturday at my house." When asked, "What is Peng Shuzhi's position?" she replied, "He is a Standing Committee member." When asked, "What about Pu Yifan and Wang Wu?" she replied, "They are also Standing Committee members." When asked, "How many Standing Committee members are there?" she replied, "There are five in total, all of whom have been arrested. However, Chen Duxiu is the Chairman of the Standing Committee, Wang Wu only participated for the first time, and I am the Secretary of the Standing Committee." In addition, Peng Shuzhi also stated in the investigation that the alternate Standing Committee members were Pu Yifan and Song Fengchun. It is clear that Wang Wu and Pu Yifan are important members of the CCP Opposition and were arrested for participating in regular weekly meetings, which cannot be denied. However, Wang Wu and Pu Yifan have consistently insisted that they have nothing to do with the CCP Opposition and have not been promoted to the Standing Committee. Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi also echoed this statement in the original trial, saying that although Wang Wu was a party member, he was not a Standing Committee member. Regarding Pu Yifan, they either said that there was another person, or that Pu Yifan was a mistake for Pu Yifang. Not only does this not match Xie Shaoshan's testimony, but it is also completely different from Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi's statements in the investigation. There is no doubt that they are intentionally fabricating stories to protect Wang Wu and Pu Yifan. Therefore, it is difficult to adopt it as evidence beneficial to Wang Wu and Pu Yifan. Although Wang Zhaoqun and Guo Jinghao also do not admit to being in the same party as Chen Duxiu and others, Wang Zhaoqun was arrested for participating in the CCP Opposition's regular weekly meetings, as mentioned earlier. As for whether Wang Zhaoqun is named Luo Shifan and whether he is a Standing Committee member of the CCP Opposition, Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi have repeatedly stated that Wei Shifan is not Wang Zhaoqun. Xie Shaoshan also did not specify that Luo Shifan was Wang Zhaoqun in the police station and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Taking a look at the interaction, it can be determined that Wang Zhaoqun is only a member of the Central Opposition organization and not a Standing Committee member of that faction. Furthermore, Guo Jinghao's original name was Peng Daozhi, and he is Peng Shuzhi's younger brother. The original trial's prosecutor asked Peng Shuzhi, "Your brother is Peng Daozhi, is he in the party?" He replied, "Yes," which is sufficient to prove that Guo Jinghao is a member of the CCP Opposition. A detailed examination of the seized school registration form (i.e., the Communist Party registration form) shows that Peng Daozhi joined the group in Changsha, Hunan in September 1925 (1915 of the Republic), and then withdrew informally. In December 1929 (1918 of the Republic), he rejoined the Opposition in Shanghai. He had served as a district committee member and student movement leader in the Hudong district and is now responsible for organizational work and student movement, belonging to the Huxi district student branch. The remarks column states "Pseudonym Guo Jinghao" and although the three characters Guo Jinghao have been smeared out, they can still be recognized. It is clear that Guo Jinghao organized a group with the purpose of endangering the Republic, and the evidence is also very solid. There is no room for concealment. In summary, the original trial sentenced Wang Wu, Pu Yifan, and Wang Zhaoqun to five years of imprisonment each in accordance with Article 6 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Acts Endangering the Republic, and sentenced Guo Jinghao, who was considered young and ignorant and whose situation was pitiable, to two years and six months of imprisonment in accordance with Article 6, Article 10, and Article 77 of the same law, and Article 64 of the Criminal Law, and informed them of the standard for deducting imprisonment from the number of days of detention, which is not illegal. The various appeals of Wang Wu and others only deny the crime with empty words, which is unreasonable. After the Temporary Regulations for the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries were abolished, the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Acts Endangering the Republic was a new law. Although there were provisions on the deprivation of civil rights in Article 11 of the Temporary Regulations for the Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries, the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Acts Endangering the Republic no longer adopts them. According to this court's precedent, anyone who violates the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Acts Endangering the Republic shall not be deprived of civil rights. However, the original trial deprived Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, Wang Wu, Pu Yifan, Wang Zhaoqun, and Guo Jinghao of their civil rights, which is clearly inappropriate and should be revoked by this court in its official capacity. Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 409, Paragraph 1, Article 410, Paragraph 1, Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 2, Section 2, Article 6, Article 10 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Acts Endangering the Republic, Article 42, Article 74, Article 77, Article 80, Paragraph 2, Article 64, Article 60, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, Article 408, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text. June 30, 1934, Criminal Second Tribunal of the Supreme Court, Presiding Judge Xia Qinyin, Judge Yang Tianshou, Judge Gao Xi, Judge Zhang Fubing, Judge Zheng Chi. This true copy is certified to be identical to the original. Clerk Xia Juchu, July, 1934.</p>

<h3>The Exercises Will Continue</h3>
<p>Japan Advocates for the Puppet State and Blocks British Military Exercises</p>
<p>Britain Ignores Protests Based on the Boxer Protocol</p>
<p>Seven Warships Cruise Between Qinhuangdao and Yuguan</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping reports that British forces are conducting exercises at Shanhaiguan. The Japanese side, advocating for the puppet state, has lodged a protest in an attempt to obstruct the exercises. However, the British military, refusing to recognize the puppet state, has dismissed the protest based on the Boxer Protocol. The two sides are at a standstill, and the issue remains unresolved. The background of this matter and the current situation are detailed below:</p>
<p>Article 9 of the Boxer Protocol states, "According to the clauses attached to the document of January 16, 1901, according to the Western calendar, i.e., November 26 of the previous year in the Chinese calendar, the Chinese government agrees that the countries concerned shall jointly determine the number of troops to be stationed in several locations to ensure that communication between the capital and the sea remains uninterrupted. The locations where the countries are stationed are Huangcun, Langfang, Yangcun, Tianjin, Junliangcheng, Tanggu, Lutai, Tangshan, Luanzhou, Changli, Qinhuangdao, and Shanhaiguan." According to this treaty, the countries stationed troops at the aforementioned locations. The number of troops stationed was usually the most from Britain, the United States, and Japan. Every autumn, foreign troops would choose a location for large-scale exercises. The American exercises were held at Qinhuangdao, and the British exercises were held at Shanhaiguan, which was the usual practice without any disputes. After Shanhaiguan was forcibly occupied by the Japanese military, it was returned, but the Great Wall was used as a boundary. The area of Yuguan outside the Great Wall was forcibly occupied by the Japanese as territory of the puppet state.</p>
<p>The British military exercises at the customs have always been in the Erlangmiao area outside the city. This year, in accordance with past practice, exercises are being held. The first exercise period was from August 1st to 3rd, for a total of three days. After the British military began its exercises, the Japanese side, wanting to advocate for the puppet state, came forward to obstruct them. In addition to protesting to the British military, they also notified the troops of various countries stationed in North China, claiming that the area outside Shanhaiguan belonged to the territory of the puppet state and that no army could arbitrarily conduct exercises without first notifying the Japanese side. The British military refused to accept the Japanese protest, replying that it had the right to station troops in Yuguan according to the Boxer Protocol, that exercises had been an established practice for many years, and that it only knew that it was Chinese territory and did not recognize any so-called puppet state. The language was very strong. The Japanese side, with its protest being ineffective, also conducted exercises in the Jiaoshan area, with a strong intention to demonstrate its power. At the same time, two British soldiers went missing, and rumors flourished for a time, and the situation suddenly became tense. Later, through mediation by various parties, a conflict was fortunately avoided. The British military exercises lasted for three days and ended on the 4th. At the same time, the two missing British soldiers were also found in Qinhuangdao on the 4th. The reason for the soldiers' disappearance is being kept secret by both sides and remains unclear.</p>
<p>Currently, this matter remains unresolved. The British military believes that it cannot abandon the treaty due to Japanese obstruction and will continue with the second exercise as originally planned from the 10th to the 15th of this month. Troops are being successively dispatched to Yuguan, and seven warships are cruising between Qinhuangdao and Yuguan. The commander of the British Navy, White, also went from Peiping to Qinhuangdao yesterday to inspect and then went to Yuguan. The Japanese side, seeing the British military's plan for a second exercise, also intends to conduct an equivalent exercise at the same time to show its opposition. It has dispatched six foreign warships to anchor in the waters of Qinhuangdao and the South Sea of Yuguan for surveillance. The commander of the fleet, Imamura, arrived in Lushun from Shanghai and then went to Yuguan to inspect the warships. In recent days, the situation between the two sides has been one of open and covert struggle (9th).</p>
<p>Hubei Province Disaster Area Reaches</p>
<h3>Over 90 Million Mu</h3>
<p>丨Grain Loss Exceeds 70 Million Yuan丨</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states that Hubei Province has suffered exceptionally severe water and drought disasters this year, with the drought-stricken areas being especially widespread. As of now, the disaster area has reached 93,361,100 mu, with a grain loss of 25,974,290 dan. There are over ten million disaster victims, with about 2.8 million people in extreme poverty who rely entirely on relief. The alarming figures have exceeded the records of the past twenty years. Although the flood disaster is gradually subsiding, the drought disaster is becoming more severe. Some counties have not seen rain for three months and still have not received any rainfall. Thousands of miles of barren land and cries of despair can be heard everywhere, which is truly unbearable to witness and hear. In addition to sending telegrams to request relief, the provincial government has also formulated a fundamental disaster relief plan, setting up water pumps, installing siphons, opening up ponds and weirs, and dredging ditches, with 2.4 million yuan allocated for work relief. The Chairman of the Province, Zhang Qun, in order to implement this plan, specially took the "Ruihe" ship to Xunyang on the 9th, transferred to Lushan to meet with Director Wang and Chairman Jiang, reported the disaster situation, and requested relief. He will return to Hubei in about a week. Regarding the detailed situation of the disaster in each county, the Department of Civil Affairs has investigated and ascertained 39 counties, and on the 9th, it has submitted a list of the disaster area, population, and quantity and value of food losses to the provincial government. The counties affected by floods are Mianyang, Hanchuan, Tianmen, Zhongxiang, Jiangling, Lishan, Xiangyang, Yunxian, Jianshi, Zhijiang, Yunmeng, and other eleven counties. The counties affected by drought are Huang'an, Huangmei, Puqi, Xishui, Xianning, Huanggang, Macheng, Gong'an, Yicheng, Wuchang, Yangxin, Luotian, Huangpi, Xiaogan, Tongshan, Hanyang, Jiayu, Daye, Yidu, Songzi, Yingshan, Shishou, Qichun, Echeng, and twenty-four counties. The counties affected by water and drought disasters are Qianjiang, Tongcheng, Chongyang, Guangji, and other four counties.</p>
<p>At this time of severe drought, rice shortages have been reported in various counties, and unscrupulous merchants are taking the opportunity to manipulate prices, causing rice prices to soar, with each dan selling for eight or nine yuan. The price in Wuhan has risen by more than three yuan in a few days, and the current price is about ten yuan per dan. The city has only 300,000 dan of rice in stock, which is only enough for the citizens for twenty days. In addition to finding ways to stabilize prices, the government also convened a meeting of merchants and residents on the 9th to discuss relief measures, and it has been decided that rice merchants will raise funds to purchase rice from Hunan to maintain the people's food supply. However, Hunan is also suffering from disasters, and it is not yet known whether there will be surplus rice to help Hubei (9th).</p>
<h3>Songjiang Temple Property Dispute: Buddhist Association Sends Telegrams to Petition</h3>
<p>The Fenglong Temple outside the west gate of this city was approved by the Second Elementary School to be used as school buildings, which caused a dispute with the temple monk Lanfeng. The Public Security Bureau transferred both parties to await a court decision. The report from yesterday has been published. It is reported that the dispute over the Fenglong Temple is being contested by both sides. The monk filed an appeal to the Internal Affairs Department. Yesterday's report mistakenly stated that a judgment had been made. In fact, the Internal Affairs Department, after receiving the appeal, first ordered the county to stop the construction and wait for processing. However, yesterday, the school workers led the craftsmen to supervise the repair, causing another dispute. The local Buddhist Association, upon receiving the report, believes that the school is oppressing the monks and has decided to send a telegram to the provincial government's Internal Affairs Department to file an appeal and await a ruling. At the same time, it is requesting the central government to protect the interests of the monks.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Zhou Gu, Yu Shu Accuses Zhou Bingrong of Obstructing Freedom</h3>
<p>Zhou Gu, Yu Shu, a woman from Tongli, Wujiang, is 28 years old. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, she married Zhou Bingrong, who is currently serving as a prosecutor at the Changxing District Court in Zhejiang. She had previously filed a complaint with the Wujiang County Court, accusing her husband of obstructing freedom and abandonment, and attached a civil suit, requesting a judgment ordering them to live together and a one-time payment of 1,000 yuan for reputational damage. Zhou Bingrong also filed a petition with Wujiang County, requesting a judgment ordering a divorce from Gu. After a hearing, the court ruled Zhou Bingrong not guilty. Zhou Gu, Yu Shu, dissatisfied with the judgment, came to Suzhou to appeal to the Women's Association, requesting assistance, and hired lawyer Song Mingdong to file an appeal with the Wuxian District Court. The appeal stated that on September 24th of last year, the defendant called the appellant into the room, closed the door, threatened her with a gun, and ordered the appellant to copy a divorce document that he had written in advance, which stated that the appellant had a vague relationship with Ren Xiaohe and Ren Chuanquan and voluntarily severed the relationship with her husband. The appellant, being unable to resist, had no choice but to copy the document. Now, the appellant presents the handwritten divorce draft snatched from Zhou Bingrong as evidence. Since then, the appellant has been abandoned and ignored. The appellant now suffers from third-stage lung disease and is unable to support herself. The original judgment is unfair and should be overturned to order the defendant to live with the appellant and pay a one-time fee of 1,000 yuan for reputational damage. After the court approved the appeal, it held a hearing at 11:00 a.m. yesterday (the 10th). Zhou Gu, Yu Shu arrived at the court with lawyer Song. Zhou Bingrong did not attend and was represented by lawyers Zhu Fucheng and Tao Jianshan. The lawyers presented a note written by Zhou Gu, Yu Shu, stating that she sought help from the City God because she had a physical relationship with Ren Xiaohe and a relationship with Ren Chuanquan and felt sorry for her husband, now realizing her remorse and asking for forgiveness. Zhou Gu, Yu Shu said that the note was also written under duress by the defendant. The court ordered Zhou Bingrong to be summoned to court for further verification.</p>
<h3>Nantong County Magistrate Escorted for Handover</h3>
<p>The former Nantong County Magistrate Zhuang Yan has not been able to settle the handover of duties for a long time. Zhuang is currently residing in Suzhou.

<h3>Wuxi Autumn Silkworm Instructors Depart for Work</h3>
<p>The two directors of the local sericulture model area, Yan and Jiang, believing that the autumn silkworm season is about to begin and that the rural autumn planting instructors should go to the countryside to work, specifically ordered them to depart yesterday (the 10th). They also convened a meeting of all instructors the day before yesterday to hold a discussion. They first sent letters to people in the silk and cocoon industry to come and provide guidance. The County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, the Director of the Provincial Sericulture Experiment Station Tang Xixiang, the technician of the Construction Department Xiong Qixian, and the Director of the County Agricultural Extension Institute Shen Xichun gave speeches until about 12:00 p.m. In the afternoon, the central instructors convened meetings of instructors from various townships to discuss the various preparations for going to the countryside. Yesterday morning (the 10th), all the instructors departed for the countryside to work. In addition, due to the implementation of the unified management method for this year's autumn planting, the sericulture model area has established a silkworm seed sales office, which is scheduled to start selling on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Finance Department Sends Personnel to Investigate Miscellaneous Taxes</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Finance Department has dispatched Yan Shudong to Changzhou to investigate the collection of miscellaneous taxes and handle the collection of deed taxes. According to Commissioner Yan, the investigation results are satisfactory. However, the banquet tax and the capital contribution tax in Wujin should also be collected uniformly by the county government to comply with the regulations. The county government has been instructed to do so. In addition, the fishing tax and the drama tax should be abolished and the collection should be stopped in accordance with the method of abolishing harsh and miscellaneous taxes. Commissioner Yan finished the investigation and went to Suzhou on the evening of the 9th for further investigation before returning to the department to report.</p>
<h3>Changshu Guard Team Leader Replaced</h3>
<p>The county guard team has only been reorganized and established for three months. In addition to the county magistrate serving as the commander-in-chief, Fan Zhengshan, commissioned by the province, served as the deputy commander-in-chief. In the middle of last month, representatives sent by Jiang inspected various places. The county participated in the Wuxi district exercises. Under the inspection of the commissioners, they believed that the guard team's academics and maneuvers were not very good, which was due to the deputy commander-in-chief Fan Zhengshan's poor training. Therefore, an order was issued on the 9th to transfer Fan to the province. The vacancy was filled by Zhu Lianfang, who is an instructor from the Provincial Security Office.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Locust Nymphs Cover the Fields in Four Townships</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, due to the drought and lack of rain, locust nymphs have occurred in the Yangku Huashu area of the eastern township and have invaded the paddy fields, causing serious damage. Recently, the county government received reports from the villagers of various districts and townships that locust nymphs are everywhere in Yunting Huangtang and other townships and have bitten off the nearby crops, causing farmers to panic. However, the district and township chiefs are only verbally calling for action and have no solution. The situation is likely to spread throughout the county. Yesterday (the 8th), County Magistrate Bao specifically sent Ji Yuqi, a technician from the Agricultural Extension Institute, to go to the countryside to investigate first. The drought relief association also raised the price to buy locust nymphs, 300 yuan per catty for locust nymphs and 200 yuan per catty for flying locusts. County Magistrate Bao also decided to personally go to the countryside to inspect various districts in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Water Police Captain Shelters Opium Smugglers and Flees in Fear of Punishment</h3>
<p>The third detachment of the fifteenth team of the fourth district of the Water Police has been stationed at the port. Ligang Port, under its jurisdiction, has always been a transit area for opium. It has been heard that the current captain of the detachment, Sun Jiesan, since taking office, has joined forces with local natives and the security corps to smuggle opium, openly accepting illicit fees without any scruples. However, the matter was not kept secret and was learned by the province and Captain Xu, who sent personnel to verify it. The Provincial Security Office sent a team to the area to disarm all the team police and the security corps and sent them to the province for legal action. The captain of the detachment, Sun Jie, learned of the situation in advance and fled in fear of punishment. Captain Xu, considering that the duties were related, specifically supervised the dispatch of Fan Zuyu, a clerk from the brigade headquarters, to act as the captain of the detachment. Fan plans to go to take office today (the 10th) after being commissioned.</p>
<h3>Haimen Seizes a Large Batch of Opium</h3>
<p>Since the strict prohibition of opium pills in the county, the sales of opium have increased sharply, and opium dealers have taken the opportunity to become active again. The day before yesterday (the 7th) at about 10:00 p.m., a large batch of opium was brought from Shanghai to Haimen by the Xinrenhe ship and unloaded at Xingang and handed over to Chen Cai Gou by boat. However, it was detected by the county Public Security Bureau, which immediately sent inspector Ding Zuozhou and many police officers to search. They seized two sacks containing two large packages of opium and brought the boatman Chen Cai Gou back to the bureau for interrogation. Yesterday (the 8th), they were sent to the county government for investigation.</p>
<h3>San Chang City Fire</h3>
<p>Yuan Futai's tofu shop in Donghou Street, San Chang City, owned by Yuan Zuomei, burned grass clippings in the cowshed to drive away flies and mosquitoes at about 2:00 p.m. yesterday (the 7th). Carelessly, the fire spread to the reed wall, and suddenly thick smoke and raging flames engulfed the city, shocking the entire city. The fire brigade of the Dasheng Third Factory and the industrial security team all set out to rescue the situation. However, due to the long period of drought, the ditches were dry and it was difficult to get water. In addition, most of the nearby houses were thatched cottages, so the fire spread westward and was difficult to contain. Subsequently, nearby villagers and factory workers rushed to help with the rescue, and the fire gradually went out around 4:00 p.m. It is estimated that more than twenty houses were destroyed, with losses of about 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Female Student Commits Suicide Due to Failing a Grade</h3>
<p>Wang Xizeng's second daughter, Zhuoru, 19 years old, from Gaojia Town, Qidong, was a student at the Shanghai Wuben Girls' School. In this summer's exam, her grades were not good, and she failed to move up a grade. After returning home, she was repeatedly scolded by her parents, which made her feel ashamed and hateful. She then had thoughts of ending her life and bought one yuan of opium the day before yesterday, secretly swallowing it. Soon after, she was poisoned, her face turned pale, and she groaned incessantly. After her parents noticed, they rushed her to the Dasheng Hospital in Jiulong Town for treatment, but the poisoning was too deep to be saved, and she soon died.</p>
<h3>Murderer of Hangzhou Leashed Military Officer Escorted to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Li Chuhua, an accountant from the third branch of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Office, came to the province on March 6th of this year to collect 2,500 yuan in military pay and stayed at the Wuhe Hotel in the city station. Unexpectedly, he was strangled to death by the conscript Wang Qinggen in the middle of the night, who fled with the money. It is now learned that the murderer Wang Qinggen sneaked back to his home in Hunan and was arrested and escorted. More than 600 yuan of the stolen money was still on him. Chairman Lu reported the matter and sent a commissioner to escort him to Zhejiang for interrogation by the fourth section of the Security Office and to be dealt with according to law.</p>
<h3>Collapsed City Wall Crushes a Laborer to Death</h3>
<p>Ying Jilin, 36 years old, from Pujiang, made a living as a laborer. At 8:00 a.m. yesterday, he was supposed to go to the city wall on Huancheng West Road, West Street, to dig and carry mud. Unexpectedly, the city wall suddenly collapsed and he was crushed into the rubble. His companions managed to rescue him, but his left abdomen had become a large hole, with intestines flowing out. He died on the spot. The Public Security Bureau called the Hangzhou Land Court to send an official for inspection, bought a coffin, and prepared for burial.</p>

<p>City News of This City</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to Guangdong Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>To Assist in Abolishing Special Taxes on National Goods</p>
<p>Even if the Purpose is to Sanction Foreign Factories</p>
<p>National Goods Manufacturers Should Not Be Affected</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent another letter to the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying: "Dear Sirs, on the 9th of this month, we received a letter from the enamelware industry association stating that, according to a letter from members such as Huafeng Enamelware Company, Guangzhou customers claim that Guangzhou is currently experiencing industrial decline, with many large factories closing down one after another. Those that are struggling to survive are also in a precarious situation. The local authorities, recognizing the precariousness of industry and commerce, convened the city's chamber of commerce to discuss measures to maintain it. A plan was discussed and agreed upon to establish a bureau to collect taxes on imported goods and goods entering from outside the province, such as paint, enamel, copper, iron, hardware, rubber, matches, etc., all of which are included in the collection. The industrial and commercial sectors, citing that many Shanghai factories are invested in by foreigners and dump their products in Guangdong, requested the authorities to implement taxes to protect the province's industry. It is heard that the authorities are considering this matter, and it is likely to be implemented. If it is implemented, it will be greatly disadvantageous to the shipping of goods from Shanghai factories. We hope that you will forward a letter to the city chamber of commerce to strongly argue with the Guangdong provincial authorities to alleviate the difficulties of the Shanghai merchants, etc.' We have received this. We have checked that Shanghai's business relies entirely on exports. If heavy taxes are levied on national goods, it will cut off the circulation of national goods. Once implemented, Shanghai's commerce will be greatly affected. We should report the situation to your association and quickly argue with the Guangdong provincial authorities based on reason, striving to abolish this agreement to benefit the progress of national goods.' We received this letter. We checked that we had previously received a letter from the China Chemical Industry Association with the same situation. The company had previously sent a letter with the same information and the chamber of commerce should send a telegram to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, the Guangdong Provincial Government, if the matter of special taxes is inevitable, please follow the example of the Pito Special Tax Bureau, draw a clear line to ensure that the national factories are not implicated in the case. Now that this matter has been suggested by the industrial and commercial sectors of your province, the strategy of mediation depends entirely on your association. In recent years, the precariousness of industry and commerce is not limited to Guangdong Province, but is a common phenomenon throughout the country. The strategy to save it is to work together, share resources, and resist the dumping of foreign goods. If we first divide the provincial boundaries and strengthen their defenses, making it difficult for goods from Province A to be sold in Province B, the scope of commercial activity will become narrower, which is tantamount to suicide, (omitted) The suggestors in your province are also worried that this move will involve coercion, so they use the term 'many Shanghai factories are invested in by foreigners' to conceal the truth from the public and make it easier for this case to be established. In commercial ports, foreigners have the right to set up factories in accordance with the Treaty of Shimonoseki. If other places hear the news and respond, saying that the industrial and commercial products of the commercial ports of Guangdong and Shantou in your province are mostly invested in by foreigners, and they collect taxes as an example, how will you deal with it? It seems that such indiscriminate and sweeping wording will cause endless malpractices. We have checked that in Shanghai, only the textile factory has more foreign investment, and the cigarette factory has more foreign power. As for paint, cosmetics, enamel, rubber, matches and other factories, there are fewer foreign investments, and most of them are set up by Chinese. There are registration documents from the Ministry of Industry to prove the establishment of the company, and there are membership lists to check when joining the association. Now, your province does not pay attention to the two industries of textiles and cigarettes, which are more powerful by foreign businessmen, but only pays attention to the various industries of paint and cosmetics, which are less related to foreign businessmen. This is probably to avoid the heavy responsibility and avoid negotiations. When this special tax is implemented, it will take more effort to clarify that a certain factory is not a foreign factory. We would like to suggest that your association suggest to the authorities in your province to send personnel to Shanghai to investigate before holding the event, and to investigate with our association which is the Chinese factory and which is not, so as to distinguish and handle the matter to avoid national goods manufacturers from being affected in the same way, which is the most important thing.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou Talks About the US Collecting Silver for Nationalization</p>
<h3>Will Not Affect Our Country</h3>
<p>Silver Outflow is Entirely Due to Trade Deficit</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reported that the US government's announcement that silver will be collected for nationalization has caused drastic changes in the global gold and silver markets. As China is a silver-using country, it has a vital interest in this issue. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency visited Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, yesterday. According to Lin's observation on this matter, it is difficult to predict what benefits or harms the US's collection of silver for nationalization will have on us. However, the general public believes that this move will cause gold to fall and silver to soar, and that a large amount of silver in our country will flow out, which will not become a reality. This is because China's silver outflow recently is not due to the rise in silver prices. The real reason is purely due to the trade deficit of foreign goods in recent years. Since foreign goods have been imported in large quantities, and Chinese merchants are unable to lower the cost of Chinese exports when calculating the price of goods, it is inevitable that silver will be used to pay for the price of goods. Therefore, under this situation, China's silver outflow is difficult to curb. The fundamental solution depends on the self-strengthening of national goods, so that the trade deficit can be easily changed into a trade surplus, and the silver in the country will not flow out.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Invited Various Groups Yesterday</p>
<h3>to Hold a Wusong River Dredging Conference</h3>
<p>It Was Decided to Spend 200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The municipal government believes that the Wusong River has a significant impact on farmland. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, it invited the Finance Bureau, Public Works Bureau, Labor Bureau, etc., as well as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Shipping Industry Association, to discuss dredging measures in the municipal government conference room in the city center. Xu Peihuang, director of the Public Works Bureau, Cai Zengji, director of the Political Affairs Bureau, Shen Yi, director of the Labor Bureau, Pan Xusheng of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Bofen, Yang Youlong, and Wan Yongsheng of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association attended. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun chaired the meeting and reported on the dredging of the Wusong River, which affects the water conservancy of eight counties: Shangbao, Suzhou, Songjiang, Jiading, Taicang, Kunshan, Qingpu. It is a pity that it has not been dredged for many years, and the river channel is becoming increasingly silted up. The mayor deeply appreciates this and specifically convened various relevant agencies to discuss dredging measures. Then, the discussion began, and it was decided on the spot that (1) the cost of dredging the Wusong River was set at 200,000 yuan, and the Public Works Bureau would prepare a detailed dredging plan; (2) the municipal government would allocate 50,000 yuan, and the remaining 150,000 yuan would be raised by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce by inviting various relevant groups. The meeting ended at 12:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Yan Huiqing, our country's ambassador to Russia, and Wang Zhengting, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, traveled from Qingdao together on the China Merchants Bureau's Pu'an ship at 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 2:00 p.m. yesterday.

The voyage was postponed and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 a.m. this morning. At that time, the ship will dock at the China Merchants Bureau's Huazhan Wharf in Pudong.</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi</p>
<h3>Changed to Flying to Jiangxi This Morning</h3>
<p>Aides Take Customs Patrol Boat in Advance</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi originally planned to go to Lushan as soon as possible to meet with Chiang and Wang. However, he felt slightly unwell, and there was important public business in Shanghai, which caused repeated delays. Kong hired Zheng Zumou, a Western doctor who came to Shanghai from Beijing, to examine him at his residence at around 10:00 a.m. yesterday, and went to the Central Bank for business at 11:00 a.m. Kong originally planned to take the customs patrol boat Wenxing at noon, which he suddenly changed again. According to Kong, at around 2:00 p.m. yesterday, he said to visiting reporters that he would still take the Ford plane to Lushan at 4:00 a.m. this morning, and his wife, Ms. Soong Ai-ling, would travel with him. He himself will stay in Lushan for a short period to rest due to his illness. As for Kong's aides, Li Qingxuan, counselor of the Ministry of Finance, and guards, they took the Wenxing patrol boat to Jiangxi last night.</p>
<h3>Factory Inspection Problems</h3>
<p>International Attention to This Issue and Expression of Sympathy</p>
<p>The Social Bureau Sends Personnel Abroad for Observation</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the factory inspection problem in this city has been stalled due to the obstruction of the concession authorities, causing the Chinese-controlled areas to also come to a standstill. However, factory inspection is of great importance to industrial safety, so our country's authorities will seek new methods to resolve it. The following is based on a reporter's inquiry into various situations:</p>
<h3>International Sympathy Expressed</h3>
<p>The failure to implement factory inspections in this city is indeed due to the failure of the concession authorities to show sincerity, leading to a standstill. At the International Labor Conference, Li Pingheng, Director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Industry, presented a report on this matter and explained the reasons why factory inspections should be managed by the Chinese government. Therefore, international attention has been drawn to this matter, and sympathy has been expressed. Currently, our country has also been elected as a permanent director of the conference, and we will certainly strive for justice based on reason in the future. Although the realization of this goal still requires time, it may be possible to break the current stalemate.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Social Bureau is Actively Preparing</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the factory inspection problem has already been addressed by the Central Factory Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, which has stipulated inspection procedures and distributed them to various provinces and cities for implementation. The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, in view of the dangers of factory boilers, has requested the municipal government to send factory inspector Lu Jicang to the Babcox &amp; Wilcox boiler factory in the United Kingdom for practical training and to inspect foreign factory boiler equipment, so as to serve as a reference for factory inspections in our country. Now Mr. Lu's passport has been processed, and he is scheduled to go abroad at the end of this month. Mr. Lu is a graduate of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Jiaotong University and is scheduled to practice in the UK for two years and six months.</p>
<p>Ruian County Forced to Acknowledge Highway Share Payment</p>
<h3>All Ships Decide to Suspend Service</h3>
<p>Due to Unfairness and Inability to Cope</p>
<p>Appeals to the Executive Yuan, Ministries, and Provincial and County Governments</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the four shipping companies of Hushing, Daxing, Zhejiang, and Ruian, due to the Ruian County Government's sole responsibility for acknowledging and paying 60,000 yuan of highway share payment assigned by the province, held a meeting yesterday and resolved that if the county government forces the acknowledgment and payment, they will unanimously suspend service in response. The Shipping Industry Association continued to appeal to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Construction Department, and the Ruian County Government to not force the acknowledgment and payment. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>Ships operating on the Shanghai-Ruian-Pingyang line, including the Xinruiping and Ruiping ships of Hushing Company, the Sanjiang and Fuxing ships of Daxing Company, the Deli ship of Zhejiang Company, and the ships of Ruian Company, are being forced by the Ruian County Government to acknowledge and pay highway share payments assigned by the province, which is scheduled to be implemented on the 16th of this month. Therefore, an emergency meeting was held at 10:00 AM yesterday at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road, and it was resolved that if Ruian County continues to force the acknowledgment and payment of highway share payments, all ships will unanimously suspend service in response. The meeting adjourned at around 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Telegram to Ruian County</h3>
<p>The Shipping Association telegraphed the Zhejiang Construction Department and the Ruian County Government yesterday, stating that, according to a joint statement from members Hushing Company, Daxing Company, Zhejiang Company, and Ruian Company, the Ruian County Government has assigned the 60,000 yuan of highway share payments assigned by the province solely to the four companies to acknowledge and pay. The company has repeatedly stated the situation and earnestly requested that another method of raising shares be devised, but this has not been approved. However, if the full amount of the highway payment is to be forcibly acknowledged solely by the shipping companies, it will be impossible to comply in reality. In addition to detailing the reasons, we have also sent a separate letter requesting that your association forward it to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, ordering that another method of raising shares be devised so as to avoid a suspension of service being forced to occur and also earnestly requesting your association to telegraph the Construction Department and the Ruian County Government to take note that, before receiving instructions from the Executive Yuan, ministries, and provinces, please do not force our company to pay the share payment so as to avoid accidents and maintain transportation. We are deeply grateful, etc., have been received by the association. In addition to submitting a separate document to the Executive Yuan, ministries, and the provincial government, we hereby telegraphed the situation to request your attention and approval for forwarding instructions to the Ruian County Government for notification. We are most grateful. Yu Hede, Chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, respectfully greets you.</p>
<h3>Separate Submissions to the Executive Yuan and Ministries</h3>
<p>Another document submitted to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government stated, "Submitting this document regarding the Ruian County Government's order for shipping companies to solely bear the highway share payments, and elaborating on the difficulty in complying with the actual situation, earnestly request approval to instruct the Zhejiang Provincial Government to instruct another fair method to be devised, so as to maintain the shipping industry. According to a joint statement from members of the Hushing Commercial Shipping Company, Daxing Commercial Shipping Company, Zhejiang Shipping Company, and Ruian Commercial Shipping Company, the Ruian County Government has ordered the four companies to solely acknowledge and pay the full amount of 60,000 yuan of highway share payments assigned by the province. With the current shipping industry declining to an extreme point, it is difficult to comply with the order to solely acknowledge and pay a huge amount of highway share payments. Our company has previously stated the situation to the Ruian County Government, earnestly requesting that another good policy be devised, but this has not been approved. Subsequently, we sent another letter to your association, requesting that it be forwarded to the Construction Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, instructing the Ruian County Government to devise another method to demonstrate fairness. However, the Ruian County Magistrate replied to your association by telegram, still requesting that we be persuaded to acknowledge and pay. Our company sent a previous letter to your association, conveying the situation, and it was a last resort. The method of raising highway share payments should first involve local wealthy individuals and various industries sharing the burden. Shares are solicited in various counties and ports to form a case. There has never been a precedent for solely acknowledging and paying. However, the Ruian County Government has resolutely taken this action, going its own way, and solely ordering the four companies to subscribe to the full amount of the road shares. With the current situation of the four companies, it is impossible to comply in reality. Even considering the circumstances and reasoning, it is extremely unfair. According to the Ruian County Government's telegram to the Construction Department regarding the method of raising shares, the wording is to order each shipping company to restore passenger and freight fares, and use the increased income to acknowledge and pay the road shares. However, it is not known whether the passenger and freight fares should be restored. It is entirely a painful measure during a time of commercial depression. Shipping companies have been affected by the decline in the rural economy in recent years, and their business has been declining to the point of exhaustion. Fortunately, they rely on devaluation to save more passengers and goods, hoping to survive. Observing the current situation, restoring the original price is not yet the time. Moreover, this kind of plan is a measure that each company has no choice but to take. The government is not familiar with the commercial situation and comes out to help plan, saying that the meeting has been passed. At the Ruian County Highway Share Raising Meeting on April 26 of this year, County Magistrate Chen first drafted three proposals: (1) wealthy individuals' share payment, (2) merchants' share payment, and (3) overseas shipping companies' share payment. Because most of the attendees at the time were non-shipping industry people, in order to avoid acknowledging and paying shares, they abandoned the first and second proposals and resolved to adopt the third method of raising share payments from overseas shipping companies. However, the four companies only sent representatives from the Ruian agencies to attend the meeting nearby, and they did not have the right to represent the head office to vote. Therefore, the third item in the meeting minutes recorded that the implementation of this case would be communicated by the Ruian branch of each company to the Shanghai head office, and personnel would be sent to Ruian to make a decision. Therefore, the so-called meeting pass was entirely advocated by people outside the shipping industry. The original intention was to avoid acknowledging and paying shares on their own and to delegate the major responsibility to others. The facts are obvious, and if they want to force the implementation by this, the shipping companies will not willingly endure being deceived by the Construction Department and ordered to comply. The shipping companies have stated the situation, but it has been ignored, resulting in the case being suspended for several months. Our company believes that the crux of this case lies entirely with the Ruian County Magistrate's lack of consideration and improper measures. What is worried is that the county magistrate is still adhering to his established views and will not only not change the original plan but will also force its implementation. Under this situation, our company is panicked and has no way to appeal. We can only request your association to forward the request to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government as soon as possible, ordering the county to devise another method of raising share payments, so as to avoid a forced entry by shipping companies and causing inconvenience to transportation in the county. We are deeply grateful, etc." The association replied that the claims were true, so it specially forwarded the request, hoping that it would be reviewed and approved to order the Zhejiang Provincial Government to instruct the Ruian County Government to devise another fair method, so as to maintain the shipping industry. We are waiting for orders.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers' Dispute Unresolved</h3>
<p>More than a Hundred Arrested, Each Detained for Several Days and Fined Six Yuan</p>
<p>Concessionaires Petition the Municipal Council, Which Agrees to Strict Protection</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Representatives Send Letter to the Rickshaw Committee, Denying the Petition</p>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council, adopting the recommendations of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, improved the treatment of rickshaw pullers and stipulated new regulations, reducing rickshaw rental fees. However, due to objections from the rickshaw owners regarding the new regulations, the newly stipulated regulations have not yet been implemented and have been repeatedly postponed. It is now heard that the Municipal Council has decided to implement the new regulations from the 15th of this month, but the rickshaw pullers mistakenly believe that the new regulations have already been implemented. The day before yesterday, when some rickshaw pullers rented rickshaws from the owners, they were only willing to pay the rental fees according to the amount stipulated in the new regulations. The rickshaw owners refused to accept and stopped renting out rickshaws. Because the rickshaw pullers had no rickshaws to pull, their livelihoods were greatly affected, so they went to the Rickshaw Committee to petition. Along the way, they were joined by idle people who were not rickshaw pullers. When they saw rickshaw pullers pulling rickshaws, regardless of whether there were passengers on the rickshaws, they removed the screws from the vehicles, causing the air in the rubber tires to be immediately released. The rickshaw then lost its rolling efficiency and could not be driven. This kind of prank quickly spread throughout the Public Concession, and the number of rickshaw pullers who had no rickshaws to pull and engaged in sabotage also increased with time. The police authorities reported that such behavior not only hindered traffic but also interfered with the freedom of others and affected social order. They immediately ordered the 14 police stations under their jurisdiction to select Chinese and foreign detectives to closely guard their respective areas. If the above-mentioned situation was found, they should be properly dissuaded, and those who resisted should be detained. On one side, Deputy Superintendent McTing and Deputy Chief Detective Lu Dagong went out to investigate. As a result, detectives from each police station were dispatched, and detectives were like shuttles on each road. The removal of screws also occurred repeatedly. In total, from morning to evening the day before yesterday, except for the areas under the jurisdiction of the Huisi and Yangshupu police stations, which did not have any incidents, the total number of rickshaw pullers detained for removing screws or damaging vehicles was 11, including Li Zhengyuan, detained by the General Police Station; 20, including Yuan Shihua, detained by the Old Gate Police Station; 4, including Chen Zhenzi, detained by the New Gate Police Station; 14, including Zhao Daniu, detained by the Chengdu Road Police Station; 2, including Zhou Lihuai, detained by the Pudu Road Police Station; 27, including Pan Xiaoshaozhi, detained by the Jing'an Temple Police Station; 3, including Chen Asan, detained by the Gordon Road Police Station; 9, including Sun Shilin, detained by the Hongkou Police Station; 5, including Zhu Fulu, detained by the Huichu Police Station; 2, including Sun Shouyuan, detained by the Yulin Road Police Station; 5, including Mao Shunqing, detained by the Jiaxing Road Police Station; and 2, including Sun Junru, detained by the Dixiwei Road Police Station, totaling 103 people. All of them were sent to the First Special District Local Court yesterday morning. Because of the large number of people, the two judges Deng Baosun and Huang Risheng opened two courts to interrogate them separately. The Municipal Council was also represented by the two lawyers Jiang Baolian and Qian Xunjiu, who filed a lawsuit against each defendant based on Article 318 of the Criminal Law for obstructing freedom. After Deng and Huang respectively examined the cases, they determined that the defendants should be held responsible for the charges against them, so they immediately announced the verdicts in court. Some were fined, and some were sentenced to detention, based on the severity of the circumstances. The amount of the fine was mostly six yuan per person, and the length of detention was five days or seven days, depending on the case. Those who were unable to pay the fine were also sentenced to detention according to the law.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Rickshaw Committee Denies Petition</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chen Guoliang and others, the rickshaw pullers' representatives who attended the Municipal Council in the Special District, sent a letter to Mr. Maxwell of the Rickshaw Committee, stating, "Dear Sir, we have seen in the newspaper that the rickshaw pullers' representatives He Wushan, Xu Zhulin, Feng Guisheng, Zhu Fengxiang, Wang Bowen, Cang Gongwen, Shan Tianfu, etc., have repeatedly petitioned your committee, which is very surprising. These so-called representatives are small vegetable stall vendors who were recruited by Zheng Fazhu to deceive your committee and have a great impact on the livelihood of rickshaw pullers. The publication of the new regulations was originally intended to relieve rickshaw pullers, but the rickshaw puller registration item stipulated therein has already been opposed by representatives Guoliang and others to your committee. At this time of rural bankruptcy and difficulty in making a living, once registered, it will increase the unemployment of more than 60,000 people, which does not seem to be the action that should be taken to relieve rickshaw pullers. Now, the so-called representatives are actually demanding registration, which is contrary to the original intention of the rickshaw pullers. It can be known that they are not rickshaw pullers' representatives. For the sake of the relief of rickshaw pullers in the city, we do not recognize the petition of the so-called representatives. We should state the detailed situation, so as not to be deceived by unemployed people. Please consider and handle accordingly."</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers' Representatives Publish the Truth</h3>
<p>In order to clarify the truth, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired with Chen Guoliang, the rickshaw puller representative designated by the Municipal Council, about the truth of the rickshaw pullers' representatives petitioning the Municipal Council Rickshaw Management Committee the day before yesterday (the 9th). Mr. Chen repeatedly denied that the rickshaw pullers had taken such a petition and said that the petition was entirely the result of a certain party's actions. The following is a record of his explanations: (1) Today (yesterday), I read in the newspaper that Xu Zhulin, Cang Gongwen, and others led more than 200 rickshaw pullers to petition the Rickshaw Management Committee. These representatives are not rickshaw pullers at all, so how can they obtain the qualifications of rickshaw puller representatives? Regarding the new regulations of the Municipal Council, they should indeed be approved, but the registration of rickshaw pullers is opposed by rickshaw pullers. There are a total of 10,000 rickshaws and more than 100,000 rickshaw pullers in the Special District. If the new regulations are implemented (four people per rickshaw), 60,000 to 70,000 people will be eliminated. In the current situation of rural bankruptcy and difficulty in making a living, once 60,000 to 70,000 people are laid off, the impact will be indescribable. Now, the so-called representatives are violating the will of the rickshaw pullers and demanding registration. Can this point be sympathized with by more than 100,000 rickshaw pullers? Otherwise, it must be determined who they represent. It is doubtful. I think our rickshaw pullers will never push out self-destructive representatives, which is a clear counter-evidence. (2) The so-called representatives have petitioned the Municipal Council a total of two times. The representatives are none other than He Wushan (also known as Heshan, Lingsheng, Lisheng, Songqing, Jiarui, and Hulin), Zhu Fengxiang, Wang Bowen, Cang Gongwen, Xu Zhulin, Shu Huajing, Feng Guisheng, etc. I have inquired with each small leader, and there are no names of these representatives among the rickshaw pullers. This point has already been reported orally to the Municipal Council Political Department this morning (yesterday morning). (3) After hearing this news, I immediately convened a temporary emergency meeting: (1) All points of the so-called representatives' petitions were denied. (2) Rickshaw puller registration was unanimously opposed. (3) Each rickshaw puller was notified to work in peace and not be used by anyone, etc.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Convened a Discussion Meeting</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council attaches great importance to this matter. At 2:00 PM yesterday, it convened a discussion meeting with all parties. Superintendent McTing, Director Zhong Si, Political Department Robert Sheng, Rickshaw Committee Maxwell, and rickshaw pullers and owners attended. Zhong Si chaired the meeting. As a result, it was decided to strictly punish the saboteurs to maintain local security. All parties adopted cooperation and dealt with the situation unanimously. As for the arrest of Zheng Fazhu, Zheng visited Zhu Maocheng at 11:00 AM and was arrested by the Political Department. The current industry association has filed a lawsuit for crimes such as obstructing freedom. The police station is investigating the instigator. The petitioning rickshaw pullers held a meeting at 5:00 PM last night and resolved to send 40 representatives to advise people on each road to stop the sabotage today, etc.</p>
<h3>Cheng Xiechun Firmly Resigns as Director</h3>
<p>According to Cheng Xiechun's statement to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, I attended the Municipal Council on the 6th of this month for the public rickshaw matter. Because the issue of changing regulations and obtaining licenses has been delayed for a long time, I am afraid that it has a great impact on the lives of workers and social security. Therefore, I did not hesitate to spend four hours participating in the final deliberation. I am deeply grateful for the understanding of all parties and the resolution of each issue. As for the candidates for the Rickshaw Mutual Aid Council, the gentlemen present unanimously elected me to take a seat, but did not state that I was a representative of the rickshaw pullers. Because I am old and troubled, I immediately resigned. Yesterday's newspaper reported that I was a rickshaw puller representative of the Mutual Aid Council, which is a joke. I sent a letter on the 10th at 4:00 PM to firmly resign.</p>
<h3>McTing's Persuasion Results in Continued Business Operations</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the rickshaw owners in the Special District decided to suspend business operations starting yesterday to cope with the unbearable harassment. Superintendent McTing of the Municipal Council was aware of the matter. Because it concerned traffic within the concession, he was sincerely afraid that it would lead to a major incident. He specially persuaded the industry association to continue business operations as usual and promised to provide strict protection. The rickshaw owners took the overall situation into consideration, so they notified each rickshaw owner at midnight to rent out rickshaws as usual.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Detour and Fewer Streetcars</h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency specially went to various places yesterday to inspect. Detectives were densely deployed in various places, and there were no traces of these people. However, those in remote locations continued to carry out sabotage. When asked, the rickshaw pullers who were pulling rickshaws expressed resentment. Streetcars at the Xinshan Bridge, Shanban Factory, Xinqiao, Wuzhen Road Bridge, and other places have disappeared, and most of them detour. According to rickshaw owners, although they are still renting out rickshaws today, because of what happened yesterday, rickshaw pullers have stopped pulling rickshaws. In total, 5,000 rickshaws have not been rented out, so streetcars have become scarce.</p>
<h3>Concessionaires and Others Petitioned Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the concessionaires and small leaders in the Special District petitioned the Municipal Council, requesting strict arrest to maintain business operations. It was said that they were greatly concerned because yesterday's deflation caused problems with collecting rickshaw rental fees, which was of great importance and significance. They specially joined forces with genuine rickshaw pullers. The Municipal Council replied that they would strictly handle the matter. According to other sources, the Municipal Council did not pay attention to the rickshaw pullers' petition the day before yesterday, which supported Maxwell and other articles, because it was reasonable. After the arrest, they were released. Seeing that the harassment was increasing, they began to arrest severely.</p>
<h3>Petitioning Rickshaw Pullers Held a Meeting Last Night</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Rickshaw Committee has started registering rickshaw owners since the 7th. Each rickshaw owner has gone to register. A reporter learned from the Rickshaw Committee yesterday that most of the rickshaw owners have completed registration since the 7th. The Rickshaw Committee will rush to complete the registration before the 15th according to regulations. It will also be open all day on Saturday. Also, Zheng Fazhu, who took the initiative to petition the day before yesterday, has been taken care of by the Municipal Council. The petitioning rickshaw pullers have scheduled a meeting at 7:00 PM tonight at the square at the intersection of Robert Sheng Road and Xiaoshadu Road to discuss how to respond.</p>
<p>Eurasia Company</p>
<h3>Newly Purchased Giant Aircraft</h3>
<p>Can Be Shipped to Shanghai by the End of the Month</p>
<p>According to the New Xin News Agency, in order to improve the comfort of passengers on the Ping-Guangzhou route and shorten the journey, Eurasia Airlines purchased a Junkers JU-52 all-metal giant aircraft from Germany in mid-April of this year for application. Yesterday, Mr. Li Jingcong, General Manager of the company, told a reporter from the New Xin News Agency that the new aircraft will arrive by the end of this month, and the advantages of the aircraft are quite detailed. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Arrived by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Mr. Li first said that the Junkers JU-52 giant aircraft ordered by our company from Germany has a twin-engine three-seater, can carry 3,500 kilograms, can carry 30 passengers, and can reach Guangzhou from Beijing in just eight hours. It is the first time that China has used this type of aircraft. Recently, we received a telegram from the German side that the new aircraft has already been shipped to China and will arrive in port by the end of this month. At that time, it will be transported to Hongqiao Airport for assembly and then transferred to the Ping-Guangzhou direct route for application, so as to shorten flight time and benefit passengers.</p>
<h3>Advantages of the Wing</h3>
<p>The advantages of the wing of the giant aircraft are that the Junkers auxiliary wing is installed behind the wing, and its length is equal to the wing. When the wind is calm, even if it is fully loaded with 3,500 kilograms, it only needs to travel 270 meters on the ground to rise. After rising, the speed of flight in the air can be increased to 260 kilometers to 300 kilometers per hour by using this auxiliary wing. When landing, the flight speed of the aircraft can also be reduced to only 65 kilometers per hour. Therefore, even the JU-52 aircraft with a full load of 3,500 kilograms only needs to continue traveling 180 meters on the ground after the wheels touch the ground to completely stop.</p>
<p>Bankers Express</p>
<h3>Savings Guarantees Are Difficult</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, since the promulgation of the Savings Bank Law, the banking industry in this city has generally believed that the articles in the law have many obstacles that are difficult to implement. After repeated meetings, it was resolved to submit a request for modification. However, the Ministry of Finance has already instructed each bank, according to the regulations in the first half of Article 9 of the law, to calculate the government bonds and treasury bills equivalent to one-quarter of the total balance of savings deposits at market prices and submit them to the Central Bank immediately as a guarantee for depositors. The Bankers Association also submitted a request for gradual implementation, which was rejected by the Ministry of Finance. The following is the opinion expressed by the banking industry to the New Voice News Agency:</p>
<p>Original Article 9. Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law stipulates that "Savings banks should deposit at least one-quarter of the total amount of savings deposits in the form of government bonds and treasury bills and other assets with guaranteed certainty in a special vault established by the Central Bank as a guarantee for the repayment of savings deposits." However, the previous ministry order only ordered each bank to deposit one-quarter of the equivalent of government bonds and treasury bills, without mentioning "other assets with guaranteed certainty." The banking industry believes that the implementation of laws and regulations should be entirely effective. Therefore, this time, the ministry approved that the types and numbers of assets with guaranteed certainty should be approved by the ministry at any time, and each bank should handle them accordingly. Currently, since the Ministry of Finance has not yet approved the types and numbers of reliable assets that can be guaranteed, it is difficult to first order the payment of one-quarter of the bonds. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency expressed the opinion that the regulations in this article do have difficulties, and the association should continue to request a delay in implementation, so as not to affect the public bond market.</p>
<p>Calculated at Market Price. The original order of the Ministry of Finance stipulated that the prices of public bonds and treasury bills must be calculated at the actual market price. However, public bonds and treasury bills are issued by the state and guaranteed by state tax revenue. Therefore, the recognized price should be calculated according to the face value minus the principal and interest that have been repaid, and should not be calculated at the market price. Because if it is calculated at the market price, it is equivalent to the government underestimating the value of national bonds, which seems unacceptable in law.</p>
<p>Guangdong Levies Import Tax on Domestic Goods</p>
<h3>No Less Than a Disguised Restoration of Likin</h3>
<p>The New Voice Society states that Guangzhou industrialists and merchants, citing the Shanghai factories and the fact that most are funded by foreigners, are using this as a pretext to dump goods in Guangdong. They are demanding that the Guangdong authorities tax all goods entering Guangdong from other provinces, regardless of origin. The Guangdong authorities have approved the request and have set up a bureau to collect taxes. Factories throughout the country are reportedly very resentful of this. Yesterday, this reporter visited Mr. Hu Xiyuan, a standing director of the China National Industries Federation, to ask for his opinion. Mr. Hu said that the Guangdong authorities' proposal to levy import taxes on domestic goods from other provinces will not only cause stagnation in the sales of goods from other provinces in Guangdong in the future, but also lead to a lack of coordination between production and sales in Guangdong itself, inevitably leading to rising prices and a higher cost of living. Moreover, this method of excluding goods from other provinces will, invisibly, create a spiritual division among the provinces, which will be extremely harmful to the future of the nation. Furthermore, various provinces have their own natural characteristics for both manufactured and local products. No single province can be all-encompassing and not need to seek goods from other provinces. For example, northern China's felt and Guangdong's gauzes have their own natural properties and specialized techniques that other provinces cannot compete with. If Guangdong levies import taxes on goods from other provinces, and other provinces follow suit, it would be no less than a disguised restoration of the corrupt likin system that has been in place for over seventy years. The adverse effects would be unimaginable. Fortunately, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products, and the China National Industries Federation have successively telegraphed the Guangdong authorities, offering earnest advice and requesting immediate cancellation. The China National Industries Federation will also telegraph Guangdong Province. Hopefully, Guangdong Province will not lack wise individuals who can accommodate public opinion and improve the situation.</p>

<p>French Concession Police Appeal Against Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, etc.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Hearing Concluded Yesterday</h3>
<p>Police Use Zhang Zuming's Confession as a Thief as Grounds for Appeal, Declaring Disagreement with Original Judgment</p>
<p>The case of the robbery at the Xue Mai Luo accounting firm at 9 Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, led to the successive arrest by the French police of four suspects: Zhang Zuming, manager of the Ruichangshun Hardware Store; Zhuang Jimeng, young owner of the Zhuang Yuanda Distillery; Wang Lianyou, hardware peddler; and Tang Qingyue, director of the Dade Hospital. They were handed over to the Second Special District Court, and the Police Department prosecuted them for robbery. After a trial by Judge Li Changnian, the four defendants were declared innocent. Subsequently, the Police Department considered the initial judgment inappropriate and petitioned the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court to appeal. The High Court approved the appeal, and the preliminary hearing was held yesterday morning. The lawyers hired by the defendants, including E Sen, Lin Yingqing, and Li Guozhen, and the three defendants, Zhuang, Wang, and Tang, who were released on bail, arrived at the court on time. The plaintiffs, who were bringing a civil appeal, were represented by lawyers Zhang Shanle and Dong Banggan. At 10:15, Judge Sun Honglin designated Courtroom Number Three for the hearing. Although the courtroom was small, the audience was still</p>
<h3>Overcrowded</h3>
<p>Though much less so than during the first trial. After Judge Sun, accompanied by Clerk Huang Lixiang, opened the court, the Police Department was represented by lawyer Gu Shouxi. After calling the defendants to the stand and briefly questioning their age and origin, the judge announced that today's hearing was a preliminary hearing. The Police Department had not yet submitted its written arguments, and the judge asked the Police Department's lawyer to briefly state the reasons for the prosecution. Lawyer Gu Shouxi then stated that the reason why the police were dissatisfied was that the first defendant, Zhang Zuming, had admitted to being a thief from the time of his arrest until the conclusion of the preliminary hearing. Moreover, during the hearing at the First Special District Court, the defendant Zhang Zuming admitted that he and the other three defendants had committed the robbery together. When asked how much money he had stolen, Zhang replied that it was about 10,000 yuan, and he confessed that they had divided the money on the Bund of the Second Road, with him receiving 1,000 yuan and Tang Qingyue spending 3,000 yuan, etc. Therefore, the extradition of the defendant to this case was approved. While in the police station, he</p>
<h3>Also Admitted</h3>
<p>And was correctly identified by the victim. According to the victim, the Westerner Xue Mai Luo, the identification was accurate, and the Police Department requested that the case be tried as a banditry case. The judge asked Zhang Zuming, "Did you previously admit to being a thief?" Zhang replied, "When I was in the police station, the Chinese and Western detectives scared me. If I didn't admit it, they would use electric torture and a Chinese detective slapped me. The Western detective raised a club to threaten me. At that time, I was mentally confused, so I admitted it. In reality, I was at the Jiangwan Racecourse with my wife's younger brother and my older brother, Zhang Zusheng. Someone testified to this last time." When asked, "If you weren't a thief, why did you implicate the other three people?" Zhang replied, "It was because I was too frightened." When asked, "Do you have dealings with Hengda Xiang?" Zhang replied, "Yes, I deposited 1,000 yuan twice on the 14th and 15th. This money was won by me playing mahjong." Zhuang Jimeng was then questioned, "According to Zhang Zuming, you went with him to commit the robbery. Is this true?" Zhuang replied, "It is not true." When asked, "Then why would he implicate you?" Zhuang replied, "I don't know. I'm afraid he thought</p>
<h3>Special Police</h3>
<p>Had a gun and so he implicated me as a thief." When asked, "Where were you on June 9th?" Zhuang replied, "After arguing with my wife, I was at home playing the erhu and mahjong." Wang Lianyou was then called to the stand and asked, "Did you hear the Police Department's lawyer's accusation?" Wang replied, "Yes, I did. However, when I was detained in the British police station, the plaintiff's lawyer brought someone to the British police station to identify me in advance, so it was easier to identify me in the French police station." When asked, "What were you doing on the 9th?" Wang replied, "I was out on business that day, and I sent bills to a certain hardware store, which can be verified." Tang Qingyue was then called to the stand and testified, "I know nothing about the robbery." When asked, "Then why did Zhang Zuming implicate you as an accomplice?" Tang replied, "I don't know." When asked, "How did you meet Zhang Zuming?" Tang replied, "Zhang came to the Baolong Hospital three years ago and asked me to treat his venereal disease. At that time, I was a doctor at the Baolong Hospital. Later, I established my own Dade Hospital, and he came to me</p>
<h3>Twice For Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>And that's how we met." When asked, "When you were confronted at the police station, did you see anyone from the Police Department beating him?" Tang replied, "No." When asked, "Did the Police Department beat you?" Tang replied, "No." When asked, "What did you do on that day?" Tang replied, "I was treating patients in my own hospital. I stopped seeing patients at around 6 o'clock. I didn't leave the hospital. I have patients who can testify." The plaintiff Zhou Jinggeng testified, "I am a comprador at the Xue Mai Luo firm. On June 9th, I, along with three clerks, Gao Yushu, Feng Ti'e, and Wan Guirong, went to the Bank of China to withdraw 38,000 yuan in banknotes. After paying back the Qianzhuang, we brought back 18,900 yuan to the office, and 12,000 yuan were robbed." The witness Gao Yushu testified, "On June 9th, the comprador Zhou Jinggeng sent us to the Bank of China to withdraw 38,000 yuan. When we returned to the office, four robbers suddenly came in, holding guns." When asked, "Who was the leader of the robbers?" Gao replied, "It was Zhang Zuming who was directing the robbery. He first</p>
<h3>Stole The Money Near Me</h3>
<p>At that time, Zhang Zuming and the third defendant, Wang Lianyou, came in first, and the other two robbers came in later." After the incident, I searched for traces of the robbers on the road until the 15th, when I saw the first defendant hiring a car in front of a friend's car shop on Guangxi Road, so I reported it to the police. He was arrested on the 17th, which is the truth." The second witness, Feng Ti'e, gave a similar testimony to Gao. At this point, Zhou Jinggeng was asked, "Did you and lawyer Yan Luqing go to the defendant's house to ask for money?" Zhou replied, "At that time, Zhao Zhongdi invited some businessmen and lawyer Yan to take a look, but we didn't mention the 60,000 yuan." The judge said to Zhou, "Well, lawyer Yan has already been convicted." At this point, Zhou Jinggeng said sternly, "Lawyer Yan is a good person. He was wrongly convicted. The witnesses they brought to the stand are all relatives and friends. This kind of testimony cannot be adopted. We, as the plaintiffs, have already been</p>
<h3>Robbed Of A Huge Sum</h3>
<p>Why should we still be subjected to official judicial proceedings?" The judge said to Zhou, "I'm not asking you about this matter. You don't need to say more." Zhou replied, "The businessmen are really too angry, so I'm saying this." The judge then asked, "Did you receive 2,000 yuan from Tang Qingyue's family?" Zhou replied, "This money was given to me by lawyer Sun Zuji as a settlement for part of Tang Qingyue's private lawsuit. Recently, Tang's representative lawyer sent a letter to me demanding the return of the money, and I have returned it in full. I have a letter to prove it." At this point, Lin Yingqing, the defense lawyer for Zhang Zuming, stated, "Zhang Zuming has been falsely accused and detained for a long time. Now he is suddenly suffering from hematemesis and cholera in the detention center, and he really cannot endure the detention any longer. We request that he be granted bail." Judge Sun instructed that today's hearing was a preliminary hearing, and during the preliminary hearing, one judge could not make a decision and that a decision would have to be made after a meeting. The hearing was then adjourned, as the clock struck one. The court then announced that the preliminary hearing was adjourned and that another hearing would be scheduled.</p>
<p>Assassination of Guo Fengqi Case</p>
<h3>Suspect Compares Himself to Zeng Shen</h3>
<p>Did Zeng Shen Really Kill Someone?</p>
<p>The Deceased's Wife, Guo Lu, Insists She Witnessed It</p>
<p>Guo Fengqi, a Wuxi native residing at 3 Feihong Branch Road, Hongzhen, was shot and killed on June 3rd of this year. Afterwards, a suspect named Xu Zhilin was arrested and sent to the Procuratorate of the District Court. Prosecutor Zhang Zi concluded the investigation and filed a public prosecution on the charge of Article 284, Paragraph 1. The deceased's wife, Guo Lu, accused the first defendant, Xu Zhilin, of knowing her husband well. Xu and the second defendant, Chen Delin, who is at large, borrowed money from her husband without success. Xu and others harbored resentment and plotted to kill him. On the morning of June 3rd, at around 5 a.m., he and three unidentified men, each carrying a pistol, came to her house. Her husband, seeing the situation was not good, feigned needing to boil water, took a copper kettle, and went outside to escape. As soon as he fled into the neighboring No. 37, Tongchangxing Machinery Factory, Xu and others followed him in and shot him dead. At that time, the apprentice of the factory, Zhu Xuetao, had not yet gotten out of bed and did not dare to make a sound. Xu and others then fled in the meantime. She requested that justice be served. The defendant Xu Zhilin presented a defense, stating that the defendant has never insulted anyone or fought with the world. Unexpectedly, Guo Lu, because her husband was assassinated, hastily made a false accusation and wrongly accused an innocent person.</p>
<h3>In Ancient Donglu</h3>
<p>It was rumored that Zeng Shen killed someone. Did Zeng Shen really kill someone? Moreover, in her initial statement to the police, Guo Lu claimed there were three murderers. Later, in court, she claimed there were five. She also claimed that a gun was pointed at her, and she was so scared that she was out of her mind. She only heard a gunshot outside and her husband was shot dead. However, Guo was shot dead inside the Tongchangxing Machinery Factory at No. 37. Therefore, if the gun was pointed at her, it could not have killed Guo Fengqi, which is completely unreasonable. Furthermore, the testimonies of the witnesses Lu Xiaodi and Zhu Xitao, etc., differ from each other. The clothing of the murderers is different. Lu Xiaodi claimed that there were four or five people in the factory, none of whom had gotten out of bed. Zhu claimed that the boss was not there at the time and had gone to work, and there was no one else in the store except for him. It can be seen that the number of people does not match. The defendant has been falsely accused and requests to be declared innocent. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Jikang specially opened the Fifth Court for the hearing. The lawyers hired by the defendant, Hu Yuanjun and Hu Jue, appeared in court to defend him. After the judge took his seat, he ordered that Xu Zhilin, who was in custody, be brought to the stand and stated that he opened an iron shop and</p>
<h3>Liked To Raise Birds</h3>
<p>And has never committed any illegal acts. "There was a Xia who had a conflict with me, so he falsely accused me." When asked, "How could Guo Lu listen to Xia and falsely accuse you?" Xu replied, "Please investigate and the truth will be revealed. If I really did it, I am willing to be shot." When asked, "Did you borrow money?" Xu replied, "No." When asked, "Where were you on the morning of June 3rd?" Xu replied, "I was drinking tea and cleaning my birds at the Dele Garden teahouse at the intersection of Yuezhou Road and Gongping Road. I do this every day." When asked, "How many people were drinking tea with you in the teahouse?" Xu replied, "There were bird friends Shen Jusheng and Zhang Yuanqin, etc. They also like to raise birds. We meet every day, so we drink tea together." When asked, "After Guo Fengqi was killed, did you go to his house?" Xu replied, "Yes, I did. I suggested that they put a mirror in the coffin and raise his head. I heard people say that if you arrange it like this, the case can be solved sooner and the murderer will not escape far. I also sent</p>
<h3>A Piece Of Tin Foil</h3>
<p>When asked, "When were you arrested?" Xu replied, "I was arrested at the teahouse at 4 p.m. on the 5th." Next, according to Guo Lu, at 5 a.m. on June 3rd, Xu Zhilin, Lu Delin, and three others dressed as coppersmiths, a total of five people, came to her house. Xu was wearing a blue long gown, which he later changed to a black long gown. They came to borrow 105 yuan from her husband. Her husband, seeing that the five of them were all carrying pistols, knew that the situation was not good and left on the pretext. At that time, the coppersmith used a gun to scare her from making a sound. When asked, "You previously claimed that Chen Delin scared you?" Guo replied, "They all had guns." When asked, "Who reported it to the police?" Guo replied, "Lu Xiaodi." By the time the police arrived, she was crying beside the corpse. When asked, "Do you know Xia?" Guo replied, "I don't know him." When asked, "Wasn't it Xia who told you to say that?" Guo replied, "No, I want to seek justice myself." When asked, "Don't listen to others and let the real murderer</p>
<h3>Go Free</h3>
<p>Guo replied, "That's right." When asked, "When the prosecutor was inspecting the body, did you tell the prosecutor that the murderer was Xu Zhilin?" Guo replied, "I didn't say it because I had already fainted. However, I told the police in the bureau that my husband was shot by Xu Zhilin, etc." When asked, "Who were the police? Do you know them?" Guo replied, "I don't know." When asked, "Did anyone else see him being killed?" Guo replied, "No." The judge ordered the witness Zhang Yuanqin to testify. Zhang is 42 years old, from Yangzhou, and runs a barbershop. He is a bird friend of Xu Zhilin. At around 5 a.m. on June 3rd, he went to</p>
<h3>Drink Tea and Clean Birds</h3>
<p>Before long, Xu Zhilin also came. I left at 5:30. When asked, "Did you see Shen Jusheng?" Zhang replied, "I saw him." According to the witness Shen Jusheng, 40 years old, he is a metalworker living in Hongzhen. The rest of his testimony is the same as Zhang's. According to the witness Lu Xie, 25 years old, from Changzhou, he runs an iron shop. Guo Fengqi's house is a dozen or so storefronts away from my house. The storefront of my house is rented out to someone who runs a copper shop. My workshop is rented elsewhere. My husband, Lu Xiaodi, and I live in the copper shop. On that day, after my husband got up, he went out to work in the workshop. When asked, "Do you know Xu Zhilin?" Lu replied, "I don't know him." When asked, "Where were you when the incident happened?" Lu replied, "I was upstairs. At that time, my husband reported it to the police." Later, I went to call Guo Lu, but Guo Lu was still sleeping downstairs. When asked, "Who came first, the police or Guo Lu?" Lu replied, "The police came first, and Guo Lu came later." The judge believed that the case required investigation and adjourned the hearing for further investigation. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<p>District Court</p>
<h3>Prohibiting False Rumors and Deceit</h3>
<p>Civil and Criminal Lawsuits Based on Evidence</p>
<p>Solicitation and Manipulation Only Lead to Deception</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Shanghai District Court issued a notice stating that the court's handling of matters prioritizes discipline. Since taking office, the President and Chief Prosecutor of the court have always supervised and inspected, and there has never been any leniency. The current presiding judges and prosecutors in office were selected and appointed by the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and their integrity is credible. However, unscrupulous people often spread rumors and deceive people outside the court, claiming to be familiar with so-and-so and able to intercede, or claiming that if a certain amount of money is paid, a favorable verdict can be guaranteed. People are embarrassed by old habits and want to escape punishment or protect their own shortcomings, and often spare no expense to seek help, hoping to be spared. However, after the case is closed, they realize that they have been deceived. They are unwilling to file a lawsuit according to the law, or they attack anonymously, or spread rumors among themselves, and often conceal things, so the court has no way to investigate. Therefore, this notice is issued to inform the public that the court accepts civil and criminal lawsuits and handles them based on evidence and according to the law. Litigants should no longer solicit or manipulate the system, and be deceived and suffer losses. It is hoped that enlightened people will properly advise relatives and friends who have lawsuits to avoid spending money and being fooled. If there are unscrupulous people who go to lobby or impersonate court staff, they are defrauding people of their money. Victims should immediately arrest them on the spot or report them by name. Once the facts are verified, they will be severely punished. All should strictly abide by this notice. Issued on August 10, the 23rd year of the Republic of China. President Shen Xiqing, Chief Prosecutor Lou Ying.</p>
<p>Xiefeng Woolen Goods Store</p>
<h3>Arson for Insurance</h3>
<p>Quilt Soaked in Kerosene</p>
<p>Xue Xianggen Denies Being the Store Owner</p>
<p>Xiefeng Woolen Goods Store, located at 156 Hubei Road, is opened by Xue Xianggen from Wuxi with capital of 4,000 yuan. He has an insurance policy of 10,000 yuan with Ning Shao Insurance Company. Four months ago, due to poor business, the rent had been in arrears for three months. Xue then came up with the idea of soaking quilts, mattresses, stools, chairs, and other items in kerosene and piling them in a corner to set them on fire at 12:20 a.m. the other day, hoping to get a large amount of compensation. Within a few minutes, the fire had become fierce. The neighbor Xin Gong Yang Woolen Goods Store discovered it and immediately reported it to the Central Fire Brigade by telephone. The fire was extinguished after the fire engine arrived and worked hard to put it out, fortunately without affecting the neighbors. Afterwards, the local Laozha Police Station, Hua Detective Pang Ruiqing, He Renrui, Western Detective, and others, together with the Western fire chief Haka Si Er, inspected the scene and found kerosene-soaked quilts, glass cups, and other items, and determined that it was arson for insurance purposes. They then found a way to arrest Xue. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Gan Jingxian stated the case and prosecuted him under Article 187, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and said that the police still needed to investigate, so he requested permission to postpone the hearing for one week. Then Haka Si Er and the Western Detective submitted a report on the circumstances of the discovery of the arson items. When questioned, Xue Xianggen stated that he did not open Xiefeng Store. The owner's name is Zhou Wenmei, and I am only a senior employee. This time, Zhou and a Yu, who makes a living from arson, discussed arson, and instructed me not to say anything and to replace the owner's name, promising me a generous reward, and said that if things were revealed, Zhou would turn himself in to the court and would not implicate me. Yesterday, Yu and two people with Shaoxing accents and one person with a local accent came to arrange things without letting me see, and told me to call for help five minutes after the fire started, but I was afraid of affecting the neighbors, so I told Xin Gong Store within two minutes and telegraphed the fire brigade. Judge Feng reviewed the confession and then ordered the case to be postponed for one week, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<p>A Rubber-Soled Shoe Strike</p>
<h3>Yu Shengfu Died Immediately</h3>
<p>The Examination Confirmed Death Due to Heart Disease</p>
<p>The Police Requested a Judgment of Not Guilty for His Wife</p>
<p>Yu Shengfu, a Ningbo native residing at 390 Siwen Lane, Huade Road, was 46 years old. Recently, he was unemployed and lived at home, relying on his wife Xin to work at the Huasheng Cigarette Factory on the same road to maintain their expenses. Xin had been married to Yu for 15 years and had six children, three of whom survived: the eldest was eight years old, the second was five years old, and the youngest was two years old. Due to financial issues, the couple often quarreled, which was common. At 6 p.m. on the 26th of last month, Xin returned home from the factory and had another argument with her husband over trivial matters, which then turned into a physical fight. Xin took off her rubber-soled shoe and struck him once on the head, causing him to faint instantly and become unable to speak. He was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment but died. The body was sent to the Pielu Road Mortuary for examination and embalming. Yu Xin was arrested by the Yulin Road Police Station and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui presided over a continued hearing in Criminal Division 3. The deceased had been diagnosed by a forensic doctor as having died from heart disease prior to death, which was unrelated to other matters. He then issued the examination report to the representative lawyer of the Engineering Bureau, Ru Bao Yi, for review and questioned Yu Xin, who was holding her two-year-old child and crying. She stated that her husband had fallen to the ground, and although she had slightly hit him with her shoe, it would not have caused his death. Her husband often slept during the day and suffered from heart disease without her knowing. She begged the court to see the truth. Lawyer Ru stated that the cause of death had been identified by experts as heart disease, and the defendant was not criminally responsible. Moreover, the couple had been married for 15 years and had three children, which shows their affection for each other. The three children are all young and depend on their mother for their livelihood. He requested that the court declare her not guilty. Judge Liu then appointed a lawyer to defend her pro bono and ordered her to be returned to custody for sentencing at a later date.</p>
<p>The Hairui Ship on the Way to Shanghai</p>
<h3>Rescued Capsized Ship Crew</h3>
<p>Seven Dead and Eight Alive</p>
<p>Survivors to be Transported to Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The recent Pacific typhoon affected both the northern and southern oceans. Various merchant ships took early precautions and suffered few accidents, but many civilian ships were sunk by the typhoon and waves. According to news from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday, the Hairui ship loaded passengers and cargo from Haizhou on the 8th of this month and set sail for Shanghai. After leaving the harbor, the ship was hit by a typhoon. The captain, seeing that the wind was too strong and the voyage was dangerous, returned to Laoyao. On the 9th, after the wind subsided, the ship sailed out again. At 9 a.m. yesterday, the Hairui ship was sailing in the sea area at 32 degrees 13 minutes north latitude and 122 degrees 23 minutes east longitude when it saw a large civilian cargo ship that had been hit by a typhoon and giant waves. They saw people floating on broken wood and saw the ship and asked for help. The captain of the Hairui immediately ordered the ship to stop and quickly lowered a sampan into the sea to help rescue them, and searched the nearby sea area for two or three hours. A total of eight shipwrecked sailors were rescued one after another, provided with clothing and food. The shipwrecked sailors said that the sailing ship they were on was registered in Qingdao and had license number 45. There were a total of 15 sailors on board. They were carrying cargo and unfortunately encountered a typhoon on Tuesday, the 7th, at 4 or 5 p.m. The ship was destroyed by the wind and waves, and all 15 people fell into the sea. They thought they would be buried in the belly of the fish, but now we have been rescued. There are still seven people missing, probably drowned, and they will inevitably be buried in the belly of the fish. These eight people were in the sea from the 7th until they were rescued by the Hairui, drifting in the sea for more than 30 hours, buffeted by the wind and waves. The Hairui is scheduled to enter the port this morning. After the eight people arrive in Shanghai, a decision will be made on how to send them back. It is said that all 15 people on the civilian ship were rescued, with seven drowning and eight surviving, which is true to the saying "seven dead and eight alive."</p>

<h3>Announcement of Staff Recruitment Results for Two Railways</h3>

<p>Tianyi Insurance Company</p>
<h3>The Process of Recruiting Clerks</h3>
<p>A Conversation with General Manager Liang Chenlan</p>
<p>China Tianyi Insurance Company, established with investment from leaders in the local financial community and well-known overseas Chinese, has enjoyed an outstanding reputation since its establishment. To expand its business and cultivate insurance professionals, the company is recruiting a number of probationary clerks in addition to its existing staff. The qualifications are limited to graduates from universities at home and abroad. Since the announcement of this news, applications for the examination have been very enthusiastic. The examination was held at the company on August 5th. The reporter, considering this matter to be of great importance to the development of the insurance industry and the career prospects of university graduates, visited Mr. Liang Chenlan, General Manager of the company, a few days ago to inquire about everything. The questions and answers between the two parties are recorded as follows: (Question) Why does your company require a university degree for this recruitment of clerks? (Answer) Insurance is a specialized field. A solid foundation is essential before appropriate training can be applied. (Question) Where do most of the applicants come from? (Answer) According to the review by the company's Recruitment Committee, more than 50 people were approved to participate in the examination. Graduates from well-known universities in both the north and south of the country, such as Tsinghua, Jinling, Guanghua, Fudan, St. John's, Soochow, Jinan, China, Daxia, and more than 20 other schools, have come to take the examination. (Question) What are the results of the examination? (Answer) Because the backgrounds of the applicants are different, the results are also different. Generally, those with liberal arts backgrounds excel in Chinese and English but neglect mathematics. Those with science backgrounds excel in mathematics, but their Chinese and English seem lacking. Those with law and political science backgrounds perform better in insurance studies, but are somewhat lacking in English and arithmetic. It is difficult to find someone who is proficient in everything. However, for the sake of providing opportunities for outstanding young people, our company has decided to select the best from the better and choose the most outstanding for cultivation. All hired personnel have been notified by letter separately, instructing them to report by August 15th. Those who were not hired but have expertise in one subject have also been informed by letter to bring their school transcripts for a face-to-face discussion with the company to find other ways to help them find employment. (Question) What are the benefits for probationary clerks? (Answer) The company has high hopes for these personnel and will provide them with fundamental training to enable them to acquire knowledge and experience and to advance with the times, gradually forming the backbone of the company. The first six months after hiring are entirely for training, because they have just left school and have no experience and cannot be assigned to any position immediately. During this probationary period, in addition to providing three meals a day, the company will provide a monthly allowance of thirty yuan to cover each person's transportation and miscellaneous expenses. After the six-month probationary period, positions will be assigned according to individual performance, or they will be sent to branches in other locations. At that time, all salaries will be handled in accordance with the company's official staff salary schedule. Mr. Liang finally stated that because the scope of our company is relatively large, in addition to handling fire, auto, accident, military, theft, silkworm cocoon, silver, and other insurances, we have also allocated a capital of one million yuan to specifically handle various life insurance policies, which has been deeply appreciated by all sectors. Business is developing rapidly, so there is a great need for talent. Looking at the insurance talent in the country, it is as rare as morning stars, so in the future, we can only actively train ourselves to meet the needs.</p>

<p>Notice from the Finance Bureau</p>
<h3>Collection of Land Value Tax in the North and South Districts</h3>
<p>Collection set to begin on September 1</p>
<p>Deadline for Completion within Two Months</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau issued a notice yesterday, stating that the second phase of the provisional land value tax for the 23rd year, which should be collected in the first to seventh districts of the South Shanghai District and the first and second districts of the Zhabei District, is hereby set to begin on September 1 of this year. From the date of collection, the deadline for completion is within two months, ending on October 31 of this year. Those whose land is in the South Shanghai District should bring their receipts from the previous period and pay to the South Shanghai Tax Collection Office of the Bureau in Maojia Lane, South City. Those in the Zhabei District should bring their receipts from the previous period and pay to the North Shanghai Tax Collection Office of the Bureau on Datong Road, Zhabei. If the payment is not made within the time limit, in accordance with Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations for the Collection of Land Value Tax and Article 23 of the Implementing Rules, the case shall be summoned and recovered, and annual interest shall be added to the amount owed, and the proceeds of the land shall be extracted separately according to the years of arrears, and the land shall be auctioned off to compensate for the debt, in order to comply with the regulations and collect taxes heavily. In addition to reporting to the Municipal Government and delivering the notice, it is hereby issued for the people to abide by it and complete the payment within the time limit, without any delay, so as not to be punished. Those who have not received the notice should, within the time limit, open the map number of the land location, the plot number, and the current address or contact address to the Bureau for a statement, so that a duplicate can be sent, and pay with the receipt from the previous period at the same time.</p>
<p>Discussions Between the Two Postal Associations</p>
<h3>Reasons for Postal Losses</h3>
<p>According to news released by the two postal associations yesterday, the China Times News on the 9th of this month carried a statement by a person in charge of the Postal Administration, which roughly stated that the post office lost as much as 10 million yuan annually due to the occupation of the four northeastern provinces, and that the annual increase in the salaries of postal workers nationwide was not enough to cover 15 million yuan. Now, according to members of the local postal associations, this statement is completely inconsistent with the facts. The losses of the Northeast Post Office are not as great as someone knows, and the salaries of postal workers have been very balanced over the years. Although junior employees have been recruited and promoted year by year, senior employees are also retiring and being eliminated from time to time. The reason for the postal losses is another reason: First, after the separation of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, the expenses were huge and the handling was improper; second, the Ministry of Communications ordered the post office to subsidize airlines indefinitely. It is heard that the two associations have prepared to ask the National Postal Conference to find a way to resolve it.</p>
<h3>The Red Swastika Society Raises Funds to Relieve the Drought in Southeast China</h3>
<p>This year, the drought in the southeastern provinces is disastrous, especially in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The General Association of the Red Swastika Society has established a relief preparation office in Beiping and has begun to prepare disaster relief measures. The Southeast Main Association's Shanghai General Office has repeatedly received reports of disasters from Changzhou, Jiangyin, Jiangdu, Jiangpu, Gaochun, and other counties in Jiangsu, as well as Shangyu and other counties in Zhejiang, and Ningguo, Quanjiao, Wangjiang, and Huoqiu counties in Anhui. Generally speaking, the drought has been prolonged, organisms have withered, rural areas have collapsed, food prices have soared, and epidemics are prevalent. Every family is crying like cows, and everyone is sighing to the roof. The tragedy of the drought in Shaanxi and Gansu is about to appear in the southeast. In addition to sending notices to the various associations, the office has sent people to investigate the disaster situation in person, and has also sent notices to the standing supervisors of the various associations, and is scheduled to convene an emergency meeting on the 16th of this month to discuss relief measures.</p>

<p>The "25th Number" Will Be Repaid a Total of 300,000 Yuan in Principal</p>
<p>Payments Will Be Made by the Central and Other Banks Starting at the End of This Month</p>
<p>The tenth principal repayment of the first phase of the Disaster Relief Bonds of 1931 was drawn at the Hong Kong Road Bankers Association Hall at 10:00 am yesterday. The attendees included Jiang Lufu, Director of the Public Debt Division of the Ministry of Finance, Shen Zaochi, Supervisor of the Audit Department, Ye Fuxiao of the Bankers Association, Jin Runxiang of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Fan Jietang of the National Debt Fund Management Committee, Chen Shengwu of the Money Industry Association, Jin Wen Yuan of the Central Bank, Mao Shijian of the Bank of Communications, Mi Deying of the Bank of China, Pan Yongzhong of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Ju Zhijing of the First Special District Court, and Wang Saimo of the Second Special District Court. Jiang Lufu, chairman, reported (abbreviated). Then, the supervisors checked and verified the lottery slips and the ledger, and executed the lottery. A "25th Number" will be repaid a total of 300,000 yuan in principal. Starting at the end of this month, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications in various places will begin to make payments.</p>
<p>Shanghai County Anti-Smoking Association</p>
<h3>Thorough Investigation of False Names and Swindling</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Anti-Smoking Committee has been ordered to conduct tobacco registration and to recruit merchants to undertake the sale and smoking of opium paste in shops, all in compliance with the anti-smoking regulations promulgated by the province, and to investigate and suppress private trafficking of drugs. All investigators have also been issued investigation certificates affixed with their photos to avoid abuses. However, it has recently been reported that unscrupulous people are spreading rumors to confuse the public, or even borrowing names and swindling everywhere, which is extremely illegal. Therefore, in addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to investigate, Chairman Pan also issued a notice to all the people in the county yesterday, and all know that in the future, if there are any people who spread rumors to confuse the public about anti-smoking matters, or borrow names to swindle, they should report to the nearest Public Security Bureau and be sent for investigation, or taken to the county for strict punishment.</p>
<h3>Forcing a Murder with High-Interest Loans</h3>
<p>The Reason for Zhang Buhong's Suicide</p>
<p>At about 7:00 am yesterday, Jiang Dianle, a police officer at the Tanzhiwan Police Station of the Fourth District of the Public Security Bureau in Zhabei, reported that Wang Xiwu, who lived in the thatched shed in Huazi浜 in the area, said that Zhang Buhong, who lived in the thatched shed at No. 97 next door, had committed suicide at home. Police Officer Jiang immediately sent police officers to investigate and confirmed the facts, and summoned the deceased's wife, Zhang Qian, who was 26 years old and from Funing. The deceased was 27 years old and worked as a rickshaw puller. The night before, he could not pay the high-interest loan borrowed from someone, and because there was no rice at home, they had an argument. Unexpectedly, this morning, he took advantage of the lack of preparation and hanged himself, and committed suicide. After Police Officer Jiang verified the confession, since the case was related to suicide due to poverty, but he did not know if there were any other circumstances, he sent Ms. Qian to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, and ordered Zhang Fengqi, the head of the 23rd map, to report to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy.</p>
<p>Sixth District, Third Precinct</p>
<h3>The Director Was Accused of a Case of Non-Prosecution</h3>
<p>The Application for Reconsideration by the High Court Has Been Rejected</p>
<p>On May 28 of this year, the family of Mei Liujiang, a resident of No. 93 Meilong Town, West Shanghai, was searched for drugs by Liu Yin, a service worker of the Third Precinct of the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and demanded 210 yuan. The case has been tried and concluded by the Local Court, and sentenced to three years of imprisonment, as reported in the newspaper. Afterwards, the principal was instigated by a few villains, claiming that Wu Zhengding, director of the Third Precinct of the Sixth District, was the mastermind, so he supplemented a statement to the court and filed a complaint against Director Wu. After an investigation by Prosecutor Lei, in accordance with Article 244, Section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, he announced a decision not to prosecute on June 28. Mei et al. refused to accept this and hired lawyer Chen Xuelu to apply to the High Court for reconsideration. It is heard that the Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Court, Hu Yigu, recognized that the original decision not to prosecute was not inappropriate and rejected it in accordance with the preceding paragraph of Article 250 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<h3>Tailiyuan Bank Expands Its Business</h3>
<p>Tailiyuan Bank, located at No. 161 Yunnan Road in this city, was founded in 1918 and has been around for 16 years. It has the oldest brand and the best reputation. In the past, during the lottery era, it was bound to win a big prize every period, and it can be called a must-win. It is famous far and wide. Recently, in order to cooperate with the government's plan to save the country by aviation, it has re-established its head office on Yunnan Road in the Public Concession, specializing in the sale of aviation tickets and a national goods agency. The business is very developed. It is heard that the airline ticket department of the bank has won numerous big prizes and its reputation is growing day by day. Customers from home and abroad buy airline tickets in an endless stream, especially orders from out of town. Forty to fifty tickets are sold every day. In order to increase customers' interest, the bank has specially given away Fengming Collection. Those who buy a full ticket or ten strips will receive a copy, and so on. Moreover, because the opening of the seventh phase of aviation tickets is approaching, the ticket amount is sufficient for customers to choose and buy. On the agency side, because the manager of the bank has a considerable relationship with major famous factories in Shanghai, it is for the purpose of promoting national goods, not for profit, and is entirely introductory in nature. Therefore, the procedures are very simple, which is different from the methods of other agencies. As a result, customers from all walks of life are very enthusiastic about entrusting it.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: In today's news column of your newspaper, there is an item about the loan dispute between the Bank of Communications, Fu Xiao'an, and lawyer Yan Dajue, which states that Dai Zhenwu, also known as Shengzu, a relative of Wang and a small proprietor of the Nissho Taisei Shipping Company, borrowed more than 110,000 yuan from the Bank of Communications on behalf of Fu to plan expenses. Dai signed the promissory note, which was kept in Wang's vault. After Wang Xinguan's death last year, Fu also had the arrest warrant cancelled, so he returned to his original position. Fu then convened a board meeting at the bank and presented this promissory note, intending to sue Dai for the previous loan. Although the directors did not agree with his proposal, Fu insisted strongly.</p>
<p>All of the above is untrue. The so-called "planning expenses on behalf of Fu" and "Fu insisting strongly on suing" are all fabrications by Dai Zhenwu as a pretext for intimidation, which are not worth a knowing person's smile. However, your newspaper's report used assertive language, which inevitably confuses rumors. Therefore, I am writing to request that your newspaper correct this matter as soon as possible. Respectfully submitted to the Editorial Department of Shen Bao, Lawyer Dai Chengxiang, August 10th. To the Editor: After reading the corrected news item about the Jiyutai Silk Factory in your newspaper's letter samples on the 9th, I was extremely surprised. According to the news of the suspension of work at the three silk factories issued by our agency on July 30, it was obtained from interviews with the silk workers' union in the Sixth District and after personally visiting each of the silk factories for on-site investigation. The Jiyu Silk Factory was indeed shut down. After reading the correction message yesterday, I went to the silk factory to inquire, and the accountant Mr. Xu replied that the factory was shut down for a few days last month because the cocoons were out of stock, and resumed work on August 2nd. Therefore, when our agency published the news, the factory was indeed in the period of shutdown. On the 7th of this month, the economic news columns of various newspapers also carried news of the factory's shutdown. The factory actually claimed that it had never been interrupted, and I don't know what its intention is. It is a matter of our agency's reputation and should be published in the letter column to clarify the truth. We are truly grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Editorial Department of Shen Bao, Dagong News Agency, August 10th.</p>
<p>Reading Questions and Answers</p>
<h3>Continued "Errors and Difficulties in Translations" (Third Continuation)</h3>
<p>| Reply to Mr. Duroki |</p>
<p>Answer: That is to say, "Instead of enriching abstract thinking with practical content, all practical aspects are dispersed (abandoned), leaving only abstract thinking."</p>
<p>Question: On page 257, under the heading "Qualitative Differences in Various Stages of Development in a Certain Process," does this mean that the fundamental qualities will not differ, but rather the differences in non-essential qualities (i.e., the so-called secondary qualities)? For example, the book cites the four periods of the Soviet Union, from the era of wartime communism to the current era of socialism. Presumably, this is a development of the fundamental quality, just like the development of the three periods of capitalism, without daring to change the fundamental quality. However, why does the book (page 257, line 3) also say: "Each stage has its own different qualities?" Then, ultimately, is the fundamental quality of each stage of development different, or is it just the development of the particularity of quality?</p>
<p>Answer: The term "fundamental" is a relative term. The qualities of each stage of capitalism, in relation to the entire process of capitalism, are "secondary qualities." However, in relation to each stage itself, they are the fundamental, primary qualities. When we take the entire development of capitalism as the subject of study, we say that each stage is distinguished by a kind of "secondary quality." When we take the differences between stages as the subject of study, we say that each stage differs in its fundamental characteristics. This is one of the contradictions of things themselves. Failure to understand this contradiction, and insisting on strictly distinguishing between "fundamental" and "secondary," will result in falling into metaphysical error.</p>
<p>Question: "…do not allow Soviet economic accumulation to achieve a development speed above that of capitalist economies." Is the character "爲" (wéi) in this sentence a mistake for "以" (yǐ)? If not, please explain.</p>
<p>Answer: The character "爲" is not wrong. The character "不" (bù) above the character "爲" is a typesetting error and should be changed to the character "以" (yǐ).</p>
<p>Question: "...the transformation from one stage of development to another is a leap." For example, the transformation from the commercial capital era to the industrial capital stage in capitalism also requires a revolution?</p>
<p>Answer: Revolution is the overthrow of old relations of production or class relations. Although the various stages of capitalism have leaps, they also involve sacrifices (such as the overthrow of small-scale production by large-scale production), but it is not a revolution.</p>
<p>Question: "The essence is not fully expressed in a single phenomenon. Therefore, the phenomenon is richer and more complete than the essence it expresses." I don't understand.</p>
<p>Answer: "It" refers to "phenomenon." The essence is not expressed by a single phenomenon, but by a variety of phenomena. There is only one essence, but there are many expressions of phenomena. Therefore, phenomena are more abundant, richer, and more complete than essence. (End)</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On Europeanization</h3>
<p>— Huang Huaibai</p>
<p>In this era of daily contact between all of humanity, there are still some Chinese people who feel great disgust and contempt when Europeanization is mentioned. The reason for this is simple: so-called "Europeanization" is "different" from our original things. Because of this, under the dominance of feudal consciousness and restoration movements, certain groups of Chinese people always find things that are "different" from us to be unpleasant. Because it is not pleasing to the eye, it arouses a sense of jealousy and opposition, which is only natural. As for the good or bad of Europeanization itself, that is another question. Apart from firing a few cold arrows with a mocking attitude, no one has ever faithfully assessed the true value of "Europeanization." The opposition to Europeanization by such people is still the same psychology as the Boxers thirty years ago, only with a difference in degree. There is another kind of person who feels that European things, although relatively rationalized and modernized, are good, but we are ultimately descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and the national essence must be preserved, and the way of the former kings must be defended. For example, the great master of traditional Chinese learning, Mr. Wang Renqiu, when he saw the foreign devils' steamships and cannons, compared to our own sailboats and earth cannons, could not help but feel inferior. However, in order to preserve the national essence, Mr. Wang issued the following wonderful argument:</p>
<p>"Steamships are the most clumsy of ships. Foreign cannons are the most stupid of things. Ships should be light and nimble, and weapons should be ingenious and convenient. Now, foreign ships cannot move until the coal fire is lit; cannons must be carried by people, and are too heavy to lift. If a decisive person dares to approach them suddenly, they will lose their support and be left with their hands tied, waiting for death." - Memorandum on Handling Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>We can still hear this kind of argument against Europeanization today.</p>
<p>However, the facts are facts after all. Everything in China is too "ancient." In the current world, it is impossible to continue to be "ancient" for a long time. So what should be done? Undoubtedly, it needs new life to transform it. This so-called new life, I dare to boldly say, is to "Europeanize" as much as possible within our possible range.</p>
<p>What is the basic spirit of Europeanization? Previous generations have already given us various explanations. For example, Mr. Science (Science) and Mr. Democracy (Democracy), which were advocated by the general public during the "May Fourth" era, are better explanations of "Europeanization." However, according to my personal observation, I believe that the basic spirit of Europeanization is "progress." In other words, Europeanization is modernization, and opposing Europeanization is tantamount to clinging to bones and challenging everything modern. Assuming that my observation is not wrong, and that China cannot return from the modern era to the era of the Yellow Emperor, then where will it go? Undoubtedly, there is only one way! Europeanization. Literature, which occupies a corner position in the entire cultural history of China, is of course no exception.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Europeanization of literature, opponents use the excuse that literature is based on language and writing. China has its own independent language and writing. Lacking this basic condition for Europeanization, and yet talking about the Europeanization of literature, the result will inevitably become a non-descript literature. This argument seems to be true, but it is not. Because the advocacy of the Europeanization of literature is to bring some Western styles and modern sentiments into this stagnant Chinese literature. Specifically: it is to transform low-level works such as *Nine-tailed Turtle* and *Unofficial History of the Scholars* into *La Dame aux Camélias* by Alexandre Dumas fils. To transform works such as *Seven Heroes and Five Gallants* and *Wild River Heroine* into *Don Quixote* by Cervantes. To transform the ballad of gifting gold in the garden and secretly making a life-long agreement into *A Doll's House* by Ibsen. To change the shallow humor of joking and teasing into the humor of Shaw. To transform works that describe the dark aspects of society, such as the *XX Black Curtain Grand View*, into *The Jungle* and *King Coal* by Sinclair. To transform works such as *A Guide to Love Letters* into *Julie, or the New Heloise* by Rousseau. This is the meaning of Europeanization. In summary: Chinese literature is like a temple that has been in disrepair for a long time, and the beams and pillars inside are crooked and decayed. Therefore, on the eve of this storm, new materials and new construction methods are needed to change the old appearance and make it a more solemn and splendid building. The purpose of our advocacy of the Europeanization of literature lies in this.</p>
<p>Finally, to avoid misunderstanding by the general public, it must be stated: "Europeanization" is different from "enslavement." The upper-class Chinese people on the Shanghai Bund often look down on Chinese people, and the newly arrived gilded doctors do not like to speak Chinese very much. When these people go to the village, dressed in Western clothes and leather shoes, facing people who cannot get fritters and pancakes, they eat their chocolate and waltz with their lovers, and complain that the floor in the countryside is not as smooth as the floor in the city. So, they cannot help but sigh and say: "China is too backward! It is hopeless!" People like this can be said to be "enslaved." What we call "Europeanization" is absolutely different from this. Therefore, we want to advocate "Europeanization" in the active aspect, and in the passive aspect, we want to prevent "enslavement."</p>

<p>The man with the beard became even more angry and bumped straight towards the outside.</p>
<p>"Who are you scaring? Who are you scaring? I've been to even Military Governor X's mansion, and his wife is still...!!"</p>
<p>"What military governor or not, I don't care so much! Are you blind? Look, this is our territory!"</p>
<p>The brothers of the business protection team put their guns on their backs, also quickened their pace, interrupted the man's words, and shouted loudly as they went out. The old woman leaned against the door, anxious and crying.</p>
<p>"Oh, soldiers, please spare us... Teacher, teacher, let it go, let it go!"</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid! I've met all kinds of officials!"</p>
<p>Outside the door in the darkness, a voice full of vitality was sent back, and it seemed that a look of belief appeared on the old woman's face, but I was uneasy and worried about the bearded man. Because I had seen the captain's temper very clearly along the way. I remember resting in a mountain family's home, and some of the younger brothers attacked the dry land, taking a large portion of the corn from the people's land, throwing it into the fire to make a meal. The old woman, her daughter-in-law, and her grandson all ran over and knelt in front of the captain, crying for justice and demanding compensation. The captain, while drinking the wine from the bottle and eating the dried beef, opened his drunken red eyes and cursed wildly.</p>
<p>"What is a little corn? Hmph, you deserve to be robbed by bandits, get out of here!"</p>
<p>The old woman saw that I was pondering and asked me:</p>
<p>"Guest, you've seen the captain, he wouldn't beat our teacher, would he?"</p>
<p>I didn't want to scare her, so I said that the captain was also very fair, and immediately talked about her teacher. Because it was very strange to me that an old woman of her age still had such a strange teacher. She slightly straightened her white hair and slowly said:</p>
<p>"Ah, everything needs the teacher, without the teacher's guidance, even walking down that road is like bumping around blindly. This, how would I understand? Later, Granny Wang told me, Zhang Dama, how can you do this? Eating vegetarian food all your life, and worshiping the Bodhisattva all your life, is also in vain. You have to find a teacher to teach you... Oh, guest, you must be hungry! I've been talking, you can go to the kitchen to cook rice yourself!"</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>"Let me rest for a while, and I'll go cook later."</p>
<p>She took out a small basket of string beans herself, slightly tilted her head, and while tearing off the strings of the string beans, continued to speak.</p>
<p>"I think about it, her old woman's words are really right, why did my two sons die on the front line? It's just that the Bodhisattva doesn't know that I'm doing good deeds, and the good deeds I do don't count!... Oh, you sit, I'm enough to tear myself, don't help me... Now that I'm worshiping the teacher, I'm willing to spend a little more money!"</p>
<p>When she said the last sentence. A happy smile floated on her lips, and at the same time, her eyes turned towards the painted image of Guanyin, and she raised her happy eyes again.</p>
<p>At this time, I gradually understood that the bearded man was probably a Qi Gong of a benevolent hall, who came to preach and teach in the countryside, so I asked casually:</p>
<p>"Old mother, how much does it cost to worship the teacher?"</p>
<p>"Uh, I can't tell others this!"</p>
<p>The old woman lowered her head very seriously and suddenly discovered a string bean with worms.</p>
<p>"Oh, look, it looks good on the outside... people are like this too!"</p>
<p>Shaking her head, she immediately raised a melancholy face, opened her pleading eyes, and looked at the deity on the wall again. But I still asked.</p>
<p>"Why can't you tell people?"</p>
<p>She showed a slightly embarrassed look, scratched her head with her fingertips for a while, and said:</p>
<p>"The teacher said that people in the world are unreliable, and you can't tell them anything..."</p>
<p>Just then, the bearded man came back, with a happy look on his face, and threw something like a brick on the table. The old woman hurriedly grabbed it in her hand, happily shouted like she had found a treasure:</p>
<p>"Oh! It's still brought back?"</p>
<p>I asked curiously:</p>
<p>"What is this!"</p>
<p>"Hey, don't you know? This is salt."</p>
<p>The bearded man replied, and at the same time, as if he couldn't help but be happy, he said:</p>
<p>"Ha, what captain, really! When I went in, he was very majestic and wanted to eat people. How could I know that when I mentioned Commander Hu and Commander Zhang, he changed his face all of a sudden, haha, tonight is really interesting!"</p>
<p>The old woman also said happily, panting:</p>
<p>"Tonight is really the Bodhisattva's eyes!"</p>
<p>"Yes, it all depends on the gods above!"</p>
<p>The bearded man followed, immediately clasped his hands in front of his chest, raised his head, and made an indistinct sound in his mouth, as if he was chanting a spell. Then he called the old woman to kneel in front of the Guanyin statue and shout:</p>
<p>"One bow... Another bow... Three bows..."</p>
<p>While offering incense. Outside the house was a quiet night, only the sound of horses neighing was heard in the distance. (End)</p>
<h3>Impressions of Zibo</h3>
<p>— Luo San</p>
<p>(8) Going to Shantou</p>
<p>In order to collect pottery samples, I asked Mr. Zhang of the local People's Education Center to be my guide for a trip to Shantou.</p>
<p>Shantou is located five or six li from Boshan City and is the center of porcelain production in Boshan. (It is said that in addition to this, Fushan, Xihe, Badou, Yaoguang, Beiling, Wudian, Wuzi and other places are also porcelain producing areas, but they are not as large in scale as Shantou.) At its peak, there were more than 200 porcelain businesses there, and 20,000 to 30,000 people relied on the porcelain industry for a living! Now, however, it has declined considerably!</p>
<p>We walked along the Xiaofu River and boarded a small coal train next to Lingquan Temple, traveling on a narrow-gauge railway. We advanced along the ridges and slopes! Speaking of this narrow-gauge railway, it is quite interesting. It was originally built by several private individuals and runs directly from Badou to Zhangbo Station. It can transport coal from Bodong and other companies to the main railway station. (There is currently talk of selling it to the Jiaoji Railway Committee.) The train is half the size of an ordinary train, but much larger than the narrow-gauge railways used for building roads! But don't let its small appearance fool you, it earns 1,000 yuan a day transporting coal. And workers sell passenger tickets at each station. For a few copper coins or two or three dimes, one can travel twenty or thirty li on a "convenience route"! This income is considered the workers' profit and is not related to the railway authorities! However, the carriages of the small train have no latches at the joints, only iron hooks and iron rings, so sometimes when going downhill, inertia pulls the rear carriages forward, and there is a danger of the rings coming loose, and overturning is commonplace! So, when we got on, we thought, "Once on the train, our lives are handed over to the iron rings until we get off!"</p>
<p>Fortunately, it was only two small stations to Shantou, and our lives were able to get off safely.</p>
<p>Arriving at Shantou, we saw a forest of kiln chimneys! We went to a workshop to take a look around and asked them for some raw materials such as porcelain clay, body clay, and axles, as well as finished bodies and objects.</p>
<p>They make bowls, teapots, plates, vases, etc., but they are all rough pieces, far inferior to Jiangxi goods and Western goods!</p>
<p>Their making of bodies, glazing, and painting are purely manual, without the use of modern machinery! It is said that in the past, these porcelain wares were sold in large quantities in the Northeast. People in the Northeast often used Shantou porcelain as dowry. Since the fall of the Northeast, business has plummeted! The number of existing kiln households has decreased from 200 to 50 or 60! Shantou used to be a famous workers' district, with more than a dozen large restaurants, but now there are none. Workers who paint porcelain patterns used to earn one yuan a day for children and two or three yuan for adults: now it's over! Wages are low and few people are employed! The problem of unemployment is pressing down on the people of Boshan!</p>
<p>In Boshan, we can see the decline of China's small handicrafts and the defects of the social system! Undoubtedly, the power of international capitalism overwhelms all aspects of Chinese life! Do Chinese people still have the ability to struggle? I sighed like this on the coal train back.</p>
<h3>The Old Man (1)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>The shop that hung the sign "Aksakov's Old Goods and Sundries" was squeezed on a street full of such businesses. The gold lettering on the sign above the door had already lost its golden color, and the strokes of the characters, which were made of mud, had been eroded by years of rain, making it easy for people to read it as "Aksakov's Old Goods and Sundries," or "Aax Aksakov's Old Goods and Sundries." But such misreadings were only by newcomers, because this shop had been on this street for thirty years.</p>
<p>To the right of the shop was a low-grade restaurant, marked as selling a "Hometown Lunch" for twenty-five cents a serving (in fact, most of the customers in Xingli were beggars who spent five cents to buy a soup and soaked the bread they had begged for in the soup); on the left was another old goods shop. The street was dirty, with swarms of flies flying around in the summer, so many that the buzzing sound could make one's head spin; but in the winter, a layer of ice and snow covered everything, not only hiding all the filth inside, making it look quite clean; but also making the uneven road, which had never been repaired since it was built, seem smooth. But this smoothness was not beneficial to pedestrians, but made it easier for them to fall on it.</p>
<p>This day was the evening of January 15th, and those stateless White Russian people had just spent their New Year the day before. Every festive day made it easier for them to remember everything that had happened in the past, because in fact it would never happen again, so they felt it was more worth cherishing.</p>

<p>Education News: This Year's Private Colleges and Universities</p>
<h3>Approved Budget for Subsidies</h3>
<p>The National Treasury Allocates 60,000 Yuan Monthly</p>
<p>Totaling 720,000 Yuan Annually</p>
<p>A Total of 32 Schools Approved</p>
<p>Starting this year, the National Treasury will allocate 720,000 yuan annually to private colleges and universities as subsidies. This matter is of great importance to the development of higher education, and all parties attach great importance to it. Although the distribution of this subsidy for this year has not been officially announced, it has been completely decided. Recently, our reporter has made detailed inquiries about the process of the Ministry of Education handling this matter, and the information obtained is as follows:</p>
<p>In March of this year, in order to encourage private colleges and universities with excellent performance and financial difficulties, the Ministry of Education proposed to the Executive Yuan that starting from the 23rd year of the Republic, the National Treasury should allocate 60,000 yuan monthly, totaling 720,000 yuan annually, as the amount of subsidies for private colleges and universities, stating that emphasis should be placed on practical subjects when providing subsidies, and the amount of subsidies should not be less than 70 percent, and the subsidy items should be equipment costs and faculty costs. This was subsequently approved by the Executive Yuan and the Central Political Council. The Central Political Council also suggested that attention should be paid to the degree of educational development in the region when determining the standards for subsidies, and that efforts should be made to make it universal throughout the country, without favoring certain areas. After the Ministry of Education formulated the Outline of the Measures for the Distribution of Subsidies to Private Colleges and Universities and submitted it to the Executive Yuan and the Central Political Council for approval and filing, it immediately issued a notice to all private colleges and universities across the country stating that those who wished to apply for subsidies this year should submit their applications to the Ministry before the end of June in accordance with the provisions of the Outline of the Measures for the Distribution of Subsidies. A total of 41 schools applied for subsidies. At the same time, in accordance with the provisions of the Outline of the Measures, the Review Committee was organized, and seven expert members from outside the Ministry who had no relationship with private universities and members appointed from within the Ministry were hired. The Review Committee meetings were held for one week starting from July 23. The Review Committee handled this matter with great caution. First, it discussed and determined the review standards as follows: (1) Subsidies are limited to those with excellent performance and financial difficulties (based mainly on inspection reports); (2) The requested subsidies for academic equipment should already have a considerable foundation, and it is hoped that there will be definite achievements after the subsidies are provided; (3) Schools that are temporarily approved to be established should not be subsidized in principle; (4) If the Ministry of Education believes that a certain special subject should be handled in a certain school due to national policy or local suitability, the original request may be changed, and subsidies for the special subject may be granted; (5) No subsidies will be granted for construction and recurring expenses; (6) The regional distribution of subsidies to schools should also be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>After the review standards were determined, the committee followed these standards, divided the process into two steps: approving the subsidy items and approving the subsidy amounts, and conducted a rigorous review. It was resolved that out of the total subsidy amount of 720,000 yuan, in addition to allocating 50,000 yuan for the Ministry of Education to reserve as temporary emergency relief funds for private colleges and universities this year, a total of 32 schools were approved for subsidies. The subsidy amounts for each school are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Jinling University 30,000 yuan (2) Ginling College 12,000 yuan (3) Soochow University 10,000 yuan (4) Nantong College 35,000 yuan (5) Tatung University 35,000 yuan (6) Fudan University 15,000 yuan (7) Guanghua University 15,000 yuan (8) Great China University 15,000 yuan (9) University of Shanghai 20,000 yuan (10) Sino-French University Pharmaceutical College 10,000 yuan (11) Dongya Physical Education College 5,000 yuan (12) Suzhou Art College 6,000 yuan (13) Hangchow University 8,000 yuan (14) Xiamen University 90,000 yuan (15) Fukien Christian University 12,000 yuan (16) Hwa Nan College 8,000 yuan (17) Lingnan University 35,000 yuan (18) Guangzhou University 6,000 yuan (19) Guangdong National University 14,000 yuan (20) Guangdong Guanghua Medical College 8,000 yuan (21) West China Union University 20,000 yuan (22) Xiangya Medical College 35,000 yuan (23) Wuchang China University 8,000 yuan (24) Huachung University 15,000 yuan (25) Wuchang Boone Library School 5,000 yuan (26) Jiaozuo Institute of Technology 35,000 yuan (27) Shanxi Chuanzhi Medical College 15,000 yuan (28) Yenching University 60,000 yuan (29) Fu Jen Catholic University 10,000 yuan (30) Chaoyang University 8,000 yuan (31) Nankai University 40,000 yuan (32) Cheeloo University 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Among the above subsidy amounts for each school, Xiamen University and Yenching University have special economic circumstances and received more subsidies. After review by the Review Committee, it was decided that although Nankai University had already received subsidies from the National Treasury, it did not seem necessary to consider it again this time. However, because the school has always had excellent performance and has been engaged in research on applied sciences and practical problems, a subsidy was specifically granted to the project as an incentive. In addition, a small number of schools, although with relatively poor performance, did not fully meet the conditions set in the Outline of the Measures for the Distribution of Subsidies, but the committee granted subsidies to give these few schools the opportunity to strive for improvement. In addition, the subsidy amounts for some schools were specially and generously approved in consideration of their geographical location. In summary, among the 32 schools approved for subsidies, in terms of subject category, science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine accounted for 80.7 percent, and liberal arts, law, commerce, and education accounted for 19.3 percent. In terms of expense category, equipment costs accounted for 81.5 percent, and faculty costs accounted for 18.5 percent.</p>
<p>After reviewing the results of the Review Committee's report, the Ministry of Education considered that the subsidy amounts approved for each school were appropriate and submitted the original plan proposed by the Review Committee to the Executive Yuan for approval and filing, and requested that it be forwarded to the National Government for filing and promulgation. It is reported that this case was approved and filed by the Executive Yuan Conference the other day, but the timing of the promulgation will have to wait until the National Government has filed it in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<p>Mayor Wu Yesterday Received People From All Walks Of Life</p>
<h3>Visiting the Summer Children's Health Camp</h3>
<p>A Family Day was Also Held, with Mayor Wu Giving a Speech</p>
<p>The Layout of the Entire Camp Conforms to the New Life Standards</p>
<p>The city's Summer Children's Health Camp has been operating for five weeks since it opened. Mayor Wu specially invited people from all walks of life to visit from 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. yesterday, and the children in the camp performed their daily lives. A large crowd of people went to visit. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Visiting Personnel: Those who visited the camp yesterday included Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau, Director Li of the Municipal Health Bureau, Li Dachao of the Municipal Government, Hu Shuyi, a member of the Children's Welfare Association, Yang Maorong, the head of the First Nursery, Chen Baizhou and Fei Cheng, section chiefs of the Education Bureau, and more than 500 guests and family members of the children. Sun Jiaqi, Zhou Shang, Yuan Zengyu, and the camp's entire team of instructors served as hosts.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Entire Camp: The camp is located at the attached school of Tongji University in Wusong. It was completely opened yesterday afternoon from 3:00 p.m., divided into front and back courtyards. The front courtyard houses classrooms, an auditorium, a clinic, an exhibition room, a reception room, a library, etc., and the back courtyard houses dormitories, a dining room, a bathroom, and a lavatory. Each department is labeled with bright and eye-catching colored paper and is newly decorated. The exhibits are dazzling, and the dormitories and other places are exceptionally clean. All equipment fully meets the standards of the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>Training Results: The camp is sponsored by five organizations: the Municipal Education Bureau, the Municipal Health Bureau, the Children's Welfare Association, the Children's Morning News, and the China Epidemic Prevention Association. Since the camp opened in July, it has been operating for five weeks. Daily life focuses on physical training and rich nutrition, combined with appropriate guidance from doctors. The children have made great progress in their physical and intellectual development. On average, each child has gained more than two pounds in weight over the past five weeks. Therefore, the family members of the children who attended the Family Day yesterday were extremely happy.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech: The performance and Family Day began at 4:10 p.m. First, Mayor Wu gave a speech, stating that the Summer Children's Camp is the first of its kind in China. The purpose of our holding the Children's Health Camp is to train the children's physique and cultivate the children's knowledge. In the era of agricultural economy in China, most parents spun and weaved at home, and children could be educated and raised at any time. However, in today's era of industrial economy, parents in general families go out to work, and the family system is gradually collapsing, making it difficult to educate their children. If we do not seek remedies, the danger is extremely great. Therefore, the Summer Children's Health Camp is a way to remedy the lack of family education for children. I hope that all parents and people from all walks of life will enthusiastically support and promote it so that the facilities of this camp will be even more perfect next year. After the speech, the mayor personally gave gifts to the children.</p>
<p>Children's Performance: The children then performed their daily lives: (1) Common sense class: demonstration of gargling and chewing; (2) Eye exercises; (3) Morning inspection; (4) Drawing class: drawing on the blackboard; (5) Music class: health song; (6) Sports class: large muscle activities; (7) Piano performance; (8) Rose flower; (9) Storytelling class: script. After the performance, the Home Industry Cooperative, Sanyou Industrial Cooperative, New China Children's Education Supplies Company, Asia America Company, and others gave gifts to the children. The photography session was dismissed at around 6:00 p.m. There are currently 54 children in the camp, and they will be discharged from the camp after one more week of training.</p>
<p>More Than 30 Groups Tomorrow</p>
<h3>Sending Off Students Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>To be Held at the New Asia Restaurant at 4:00 p.m.</p>
<p>It is Expected That Attendance Will Be Exceptionally Enthusiastic</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and the China National Students Union are initiating a send-off for students studying abroad, and the number of participating groups is very enthusiastic. So far, the organizations that have agreed to initiate the event include Jiaotong University, Jinan University, various newspapers, and various cultural groups, totaling 34 organizations. It is known that the send-off will be held at the New Asia Restaurant at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow (the 12th). In addition to sending out invitations to all students going to Europe and America this year, the preparatory office has also sent invitations to leaders from all walks of life in China and abroad to attend and support the event. As of yesterday, more than 300 people have returned reply slips indicating their participation, including Wu Tiecheng, Hu Yiye, Pan Gongzhan, and Mu Jiechu. In addition to Mayor Wu chairing the meeting, Pan Gongzhan, Mu Ouchu, Li Zhaohuan, and Liu Zhanen will also be invited to speak. There will also be music performances, with Cai Shao Xu, Jiang Dingxian, and Chen Kexin invited to perform. It is expected that the event will be a great success.</p>

<p>The Poverty Alleviation Education Fund's fourth examination for subsidized students was held at Tatung University from July 28th to 31st. The scores of each subject have been evaluated by the Examination Committee. A total of three university students, Cheng Danzhi, Huang Hanqiu, and Yao Songyao, and ten high school graduates, Chen Taikai, Sun Fangduo, Wan Yongsheng, You Shanliang, Zhang Chuanzhong, Yang Zuode, Qiu Yingchuan, Cai Changnian, Fan Meifang, and Peng Zhu, have been admitted.</p>
<h3>Postponement of High School Entrance Examination</h3>
<p>Postponed to August 20th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued a notice on the postponement of the make-up examination for students who did not finish the examination due to illness during the second semester graduation examination for high school students in the 22nd academic year. The notice states that the bureau had previously scheduled a make-up examination for students who were unable to attend the examination or did not finish the examination due to illness or other reasons, and had issued a notice to that effect. As the date of the make-up examination is approaching, all students who are supposed to participate in this make-up examination have either not recovered from their illness or have left Shanghai to return to their hometowns, making it difficult for them to participate in the make-up examination as scheduled. Many have requested permission to postpone the examination. In consideration of the difficult circumstances of these students, the bureau has approved the postponement of the make-up examination to August 20th, 21st, and 22nd. The deadline for schools to submit the list and photos of students taking the make-up examination has been extended to the 14th of this month to facilitate the process. After this make-up examination, no further make-up examinations will be held for this academic year. All students must report on time and must not delay themselves. This notice is hereby issued for your information.</p>

<h3>An Amateur-Style Transmitter</h3>
<p>— Ying Fu</p>
<p>(Wavelength 40 to 100 Meters)</p>
<p>This transmitter is simple to manufacture, and the components are commonly used in radios. On the antenna side, no special installation is required. Friends who are interested in broadcasting may want to try it. However, during testing, the wavelength can only be within 40 to 100 meters. Of course, 200, 300, 600, or even 1000 meters are also possible. This only requires increasing the number of turns of the coils. However, these wavelengths are reserved for broadcasting. If amateur enthusiasts want to use wavelengths above 150 meters, then all radio reception within 25 kilometers will be disrupted. If the Ministry of Communications finds out, a lawsuit is inevitable. Therefore, it is best to test within 40 to 100 meters. Moreover, this type of wavelength can transmit far. I have used this machine for communication and reached a distance of 150 kilometers. It can transmit even further for telegraphy. At that time, the two tubes I used were Philips B405.</p>
<p>For the three coils, use No. 20 double silk-covered wire. On a three-inch diameter rubber tube, first wind Ll four turns, then leave about half an inch and wind four turns for L2. Do not break the wire. Continuously draw a wire end, about a quarter of an inch apart, and then wind four turns for L3.</p>
<p>In the ground circuit, connect an ammeter (0-1A5) or a small light bulb in series to see the oscillation situation.</p>
<p>For the high-frequency choke coil, use No. 30 double sand-covered wire and wind about 100 turns on a half-inch diameter and three-inch long wooden post.</p>
<p>If the wavelength used is 60 to 100 meters, then the number of turns of the above four coils must be increased by 50%.</p>
<p>T is the amplitude modulation transformer, with a ratio of 1:10 to 1:40. When not in use, use the switch S to short-circuit the microphone power supply. This dry battery is 4 to 9 volts.</p>
<p>AFC is a 30-henry low-frequency choke coil, which can be purchased ready-made.</p>
<p>To send a telegram, insert the telegraph key at X. This transmitter is inexpensive and lightweight and can be installed in a box for use as a travel transmitter. (End)</p>
<h3>Using Ultra-Short Waves for Short-Range Communication</h3>
<p>— Liu Tongkang</p>
<p>Holidays really give me a lot of convenience. Although the weather is so hot that people are sweating, it finally cannot stop my active heart.</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, the author has been experimenting with using ultra-short waves for short-range communication. As a result, the results can be considered satisfactory. Now I will briefly describe the experimental process for the reference of comrades.</p>
<p>Originally, experimenting with ultra-short waves was something we had longed for for a long time! After all, the result of hard work is that the seeds of hope have formed into the fruits of reality!</p>
<p>In an old Western publication, we actually found two circuits that suit our taste | | both economical and simple | | but because they cannot be used for both transmitting and receiving with one machine, and the equipment of parts requires doubling, we had to improve them. In this way, it not only conforms to the principle of economy, but also makes it more convenient to use and manage.</p>
<p>After the parts were assembled, the comparison test began. A total of two transceivers were assembled this time, so in fact no difficulties occurred! But the first communication test failed!</p>
<p>After a careful inspection, it was discovered that this was the case! It turned out that the vacuum tube I was using had been working for eight months, and the power of the filament to emit electrons would naturally be much weaker. When the screen voltage was low (22.5 volts), the vacuum tube did not oscillate! So I doubled the B voltage and then did the second test!</p>
<p>The test was successful in the early morning! This time we communicated with a distance of more than ten feet, and the wavelength was about five meters of ultra-short wave | | | It is a pity that the amplitude of the pronunciation is too narrow. If we did not use a slow-speed dial, this failure would be inevitable!</p>
<p>This experimental experience is really worth reporting to comrades. I hope comrades can also use ultra-short waves to conduct an experiment! And thoroughly research the ultra-short wave! This may be more meaningful than simply listening to broadcast music!</p>
<p>Application parts</p>
<p>C1 is a variable capacitor for adjusting the wavelength, with a capacity of 0.00005 MFD</p>
<p>C2 is a 0.000IMFD fixed capacitor</p>
<p>C3 is an OIMFD fixed capacitor</p>
<p>R1 is an I0000 ohm fixed resistor</p>
<p>J1 J2 are both closed jacks</p>
<p>V1 is a No. 30 power-saving vacuum tube.</p>
<p>T1 is an amplitude modulation transformer</p>
<p>M is a single-button microphone</p>
<p>L1 L2 are coils. If the wavelength is five meters, use a one-inch diameter rubber tube. L1 and L2 each wind two turns with 22-strand yarn-covered wire. A gap must be left between each turn to reduce losses. If the wavelength is 25 meters, L1 and L2 each wind six turns. The rest is the same.</p>
<p>When recording, insert the jack J1 at the X in Figure 2. When receiving, connect the headset to J2.</p>
<p>For other arrangements in the machine, it is better to keep the wiring short as shown in Figure 2. A slow-speed dial must be used for adjustment. Also, the front panel of the machine must be metal to avoid human induction.</p>
<h3>Single-Tube AC/DC Dual-Purpose Radio Wang Maosheng</h3>
<p>Ordinary AC radios require at least two vacuum tubes, one for rectification and one for detection. The 12A7 vacuum tube is a recent invention that combines rectification and detection into one tube, making it very convenient to use. Moreover, it can be used for both AC and DC power, and the efficiency is also high. Now I will introduce it as follows.</p>
<p>The 12A7 vacuum tube contains a pentode and a rectifier tube, with a total of seven pins. The grid is on top of the vacuum tube. The components shown on each pin are shown in the attached figure. The whole machine should be made of aluminum plates, about 5"X7" in size and about 2" high. A cover should be added to the vacuum tube to avoid noise. The ground wires shown in the figure can be gathered at a suitable point on the aluminum plate and connected to each other. Another 15"X7" Bakelite board is installed with SW, R4C2, J, etc. Other components are installed separately above or below the aluminum plate.</p>
<p>The ground wire can be grounded or not grounded at the Grd position. C1 depends on the height or length of the antenna.</p>
<p>The installation of this machine is simple and the operation is convenient. The capacity of each component is as shown in the figure.</p>
<h3>Powerful Single-Tube Receiver with Crystal Detection</h3>
<p>— KMK</p>
<p>The circuit diagram above is a modified version of one published in a certain wireless magazine. The effect of the experiment is very considerable and can be comparable to ordinary two-tube receivers. Using a speaker to play the broadcasts of local stations is loud enough, so I specially introduce it here for the enjoyment of interested readers. The circuit is named the Gernsback Megadyne type. It first uses a crystal for detection and then connects a powerful tube for amplification. The regeneration force is adjusted with a variable capacitor (C) and a variable resistor (R2) is used to control the tone. The coil L uses No. 30 enameled wire and is wound 75 turns on a three-inch diameter rubber tube. L uses No. 32 enameled wire and is wound 40 turns on a one-and-a-half-inch diameter rubber tube (installed in the middle of L so that it can rotate). R·F·C· can use No. 38 enameled wire and wind 252 turns on a three-quarter-inch diameter wooden shaft (with hard paper clamped at both ends of the shaft to prevent the wire from scattering). C is a .00025MF variable capacitor. C1 is a .0005MF variable capacitor. C2 is a .0005MF fixed capacitor. C3 is the same as C. R is a five megohm fixed resistor (i.e., 5MEG grid leak). RX is a twelve ohm variable filament resistor. R2 is a 10,000 ohm variable resistor. D·C· is a sensitive crystal (it is best to use a compound carbon type). The vacuum tube uses a No. 33 powerful pentode. A battery uses 1.5 volts or 3 volts (when using 3 volts, do not fully open the filament resistor, otherwise the filament may burn out). B battery uses 135 volts, but when using a headset, a B battery of 45 volts is enough.</p>
<h3>Crystal Pocket Radio</h3>
<p>— Jianqin</p>
<p>The pocket radio introduced now has been tested by several comrades, and the results are very remarkable. Its only advantage is that it is convenient to carry (the whole machine is installed in a single headset) and saves the trouble of adjustment. Without the need for antenna and ground wire installation, you can listen to beautiful music anytime and anywhere. The detailed manufacturing method is described below for the research of comrades.</p>
<p>Materials: Ordinary headset, one sensitive crystal, one thick cardboard, one small square of thin copper sheet, two yards of lamp wire, one connecting clip. Manufacturing method:</p>
<p>A is a stylus cut from a thin copper sheet. The dashed line indicates the curved position during installation.</p>
<p>B is a crystal cup, also made of copper sheet. Bend the four corners on the left and right to clamp the crystal. The three small holes at the top and bottom are empty to enter C.</p>
<p>C is cut from thick manure paper. Its surrounding size should be in tight contact with the inner wall of the headset. The size of the rectangular hole in the middle should be suitable for the two wire balls in the headset to pass through. The three small holes next to it are used to install the crystal cup.</p>
<p>D is the situation after installation. The dashed line indicates the wiring under the paper sheet.</p>
<p>E is the complete circuit diagram</p>
<p>How to receive the radio: In places near the broadcasting station, you only need to clip the clip to a wide range of metal objects. (For example, lead sheets, water tanks, lead sheaths of wires, iron beds, copper beds, metal supports, and metal chimneys, etc.) to receive beautiful music.</p>
<p>Note: When receiving radio, the iron rust or paint and all insulation materials must be scraped off from the place where the clip is clipped, and it is advisable to press the palm of your hand on the back of the headset, because there is a wire inside connected to the outer shell (that is, one end of the stylus and coil is connected to the magnet and the magnet is connected to the outer shell). Pressing your hand on it allows the current to enter the body. Because the human body has an electricity storage function, it can increase the volume. The dashed line F in Figure E indicates this meaning and does not mean that a ground wire is required.</p>
<h3>Another Connection Method for Dual Speakers</h3>
<p>— Lu Guizhen</p>
<p>Usually, when we connect dual speakers, we all use methods such as series connection or parallel connection. Now the author will introduce a new connection method, which was recently discovered. Although it is only limited to machines that are originally equipped with dynamic speakers! But it is very interesting. All comrades who have dynamic speakers on their radios can try it; people are not in danger of electric shock, and the speakers do not have to be directly connected to high-voltage electricity, so problems such as mismatched resistance, loss of magnetism, and broken wires can be avoided; the method is to connect one end of the speaker to the iron core of the original dynamic speaker of the machine, and connect the other end to the ground terminal.</p>
<p>Headphones can also be connected and used in the same way without any risk of damage.</p>
<h3>Key Points for Selecting and Purchasing AC Radios (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhiban</p>
<p>(3) Review of the structure Generally, low-priced imported AC radios often fail to be durable due to the desire to reduce costs. For example, filter capacitors are mostly made of low-value electrolytic or paste-type. This type of capacitor has a relatively low withstand voltage and a certain and relatively short lifespan. If the capacitor is broken down, the transformer and rectifier tube will also be damaged. According to the statistics of a large repair company, more than 75% of the diseases of radios are caused by the power supply, rectification, and filtering parts. Therefore, when purchasing a radio, it is best to have paper-based filter capacitors that can withstand high voltage, followed by carbon resistance resistors and volume controllers (i.e., variable carbon resistors). Poor design or manufacturing will cause a lot of noise a few weeks after purchasing the machine, and eventually damage, and burning out vacuum tubes and other components is also not uncommon. Carbon resistance resistors have a certain power consumption rate. In standardized designs, the power consumption rate of the carbon resistance resistor itself must be more than three times the actual power consumption rate. This will prevent overheating, changes in resistance, and damage, and can withstand long-term work. But in reality, the design is often very harsh, so it cannot be durable. As for the volume controller, it is often prone to noise and obstacles due to poor manufacturing, frequent rotation and friction. There are many other shortcomings. In short, if you are greedy for cheap and have no choice, you will not be fooled.</p>
<p>(4) Secrets of listening When purchasing a radio, you should first order the merchant to disassemble the internal machinery to see if the filter capacitor is made of paper, and whether the carbon resistance resistor has a large power consumption rate. Whether the construction of each part is solid and reliable. Then check the applied voltage and frequency numbers indicated on the trademark plate or power transformer to see if they meet the local power supply. If you are satisfied with everything, you can try listening. Listening is the only way to investigate a radio, and it also needs special attention. Do not let the merchant listen to several well-known radios, and think that you are satisfied. You must listen one by one according to the program list to see if there is any noise or interference. Whether the engraved index completely matches the frequency number of the radio station. You can also compare and listen to other brands of radios, so you will not make a mistake. Readers should pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Domestic and Foreign News</h3>
<p>Sherman Vacuum Tubes are Selling Well Sherman vacuum tubes managed by the American Parallel Electric Company can indeed make radios have unexpected power, so they have become popular in China in just a few days. The materials used in the tube are all selected from the best quality. If the sound of a radio is not loud enough, use it, and the sound will be loud and realistic. The Steward radio uses this type of vacuum tube, so the radio reception is better than other machines. Those who have radios should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The Qikai radio station owned by the Westerner Mrs. C. M. Robertson, call sign XQHB, is the leader in the beauty of its sound quality among Western radio stations. It has always been praised and loved by foreigners. The station recently developed a problem and immediately called the technicians of the Great Shanghai Wireless Electric Company to repair it. In a few hours, all its problems were completely repaired, and the sound quality and volume were better than before. The station owner was of course very satisfied and ordered a set of amplifiers from the company for the amplification part of the radio station. It can be seen that the company's technology is excellent and the engineering is rapid. It is no coincidence that Westerners also trust the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Hanchao, the founder of the Great Shanghai Wireless Electric Company and a Bachelor of Science from St. John's University, will take the President Hoover ship to the United States on the 14th of this month to enter Yale University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, majoring in electrical engineering and wireless engineering. After completing his studies, he will enter a famous American factory for practical training to deepen his knowledge. In the future, when he returns to China after completing his studies, not only will the company add an outstanding talent, but also China's wireless business, which is still in its infancy, will make a great contribution.</p>
<h3>Director of the Buddhist Radio Station Now Temporarily Appointed to Gui Shuncheng</h3>
<p>Focus on popular social education and propaganda of Mahayana Buddhism Savior articles Improvement of entertainment programs Compilation and collection of scripts for dramas, songs, and storytelling</p>
<p>Since the preparation and establishment of the Buddhist Radio Station, the affairs have been presided over by Lay Buddhist Li Fohou, the Standing Committee Member of the Management Committee of the station. Recently, in order to develop the station's affairs, Mr. Gui Wuheng has been hired to act as the director of the station. The Standing Committee Member of the Management Committee is still held by Mr. Shi Guan and Li. According to Gui, he is a senior in the literary and artistic circles. Twenty years ago, when European and American translated novels were popular in Shanghai, Gui served as an editor in the Novel Forest and Hongwen Bookstore, and worked with seniors in the literary world, Mr. Zeng Junmengpu, the Sick Man of East Asia, and Mr. Xu Nianci, the Awakening of the East China Sea, for a long time. At that time, Lay Buddhist Fohou (legal name Tiehan) was also a special writer for Novel Forest. Gui later served in the police, naval, and educational circles in the north and south and was away from Shanghai for many years. Now he has returned from his travels and reunited with Lay Buddhist Fohou after a long absence, so he invited him to assist. I think that the Buddhist Radio Station will have special splendor for the broadcasting programs in the future. It is also heard that the broadcasting scripts of the station have been sent to the authorities for review and are planned to be granted patents or copyrights to encourage literature and art. A special appointment of famous experts is now engaging in compilation or collection. If there are manuscripts and advertisements, etc., you can directly contact Gui. The publication of the remuneration rules for soliciting manuscripts will also be announced in the newspaper.</p>

<h3>Idle Chatter on Wu Maidens</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>For days, listening to the Suzhou Tan girls on "Lai Dian Hua," their singing voices are delicate and moving, truly soul-stirring. It suddenly reminded me of Bai Letian's poem: "Wu Maiden's Evening Rain Xiao Xiao Tune, long since I haven't heard it since leaving Jiangnan." Letian was, after all, a social poet, a man of many affections. Qian Mengsou has a line, "Who sings the Wu Maiden's Tune in the East Wind? Evening Rain Xiao Xiao surrounds the forbidden city." He also speaks of the Evening Rain Xiao Xiao Tune. Even Wang Yuyang has a poem saying, "Waves circle around Lei Pond in a stream, to this day the Shui Diao grieves Yangzhou, in recent years accustomed to hearing the Wu Maiden's Tune, Evening Rain Xiao Xiao above the water pavilion." "Seven years of farewell banquets, what can be done? Jade pot, red tears conceal green eyebrows, Evening Rain Xiao Xiao Nanyang Station, listening again to the Wu Maiden's Tune." Evening Rain Xiao Xiao, there probably really is such a tune. I wonder how it compares to today's drizzling rain?</p>
<p>Wu Maidens are not only good at singing; even those who don't sing have a reputation for beauty that is widely known. For example, the boat girls recorded in the "Wu Gate Pleasure Boat Records" were the object of Suzhou's amorous affections a hundred years ago. Later, Cangqiao Lane became Kai Pa Lane, and the boat girls fell out of fashion. However, some of the pleasure boats, those that row the boats, are still graceful and charming. Zeng Mengpu's "Flower in a Sinful Sea" has descriptions of these "hot water boats." They are called "hot water boats" because the boats are rowed so slowly that the water is stirred up and becomes warm. But now it's not the same. Although a few pleasure boats can still be found near Guangji Bridge, the boat girls are all wrinkled and old. Which young girl would still patiently stay on these cold water boats?</p>
<p>Matchmakers are also a type of Wu Maiden, having cultivated a mouth that can speak a torrent of flowery words. If you listen from across the wall, no one can tell if they are young or old, but their voices are always soft, gentle, and melodious. They rely on a few old rules and the traditional family customs of the ladies and grandmothers, and can still pass down their profession through generations, occupying a position in weddings, funerals, and celebrations. But many families are also doing away with them.</p>
<p>In the past, Suzhou women liked to be particular about their hairstyles. If they felt their own skills were lacking, they would hire someone to do their hair, and thus a type of "hairdresser aunt" was created. It is likely that people who made a living this way could not be too old. They freely entered people's homes, and could talk about anything with their female clients. In the past, they were certainly considered outstanding in their profession. However, since the fashion of short hair became popular, their business has greatly declined.</p>
<p>The latter two types of women have become a waning force in Suzhou society. Therefore, Wu Maidens as Wu Maidens have become haggard and pathetic.</p>
<p>As for the singing Wu Maidens, they are also in decline. Although old brothels can still be found that offer wine and shave heads, they cannot openly send notes or respond to calls, and they are also silent and do not sing at banquets. So, the Evening Rain Xiao Xiao Tune is almost impossible to hear in Suzhou. Only female storytellers sing a few popular tunes when they are in good spirits. But most likely, those who listen to the songs have other intentions. So, isn't the Wu Maiden's Song about to become a thing of the past?</p>
<h3>Idle Talk of Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Shi Jiu</p>
<p>The city of Suzhou is in the shape of a turtle, and in the past, it only had six city gates. This symbolizes the turtle's head, tail, and four feet. It is said that at the end of the Yuan dynasty, Xu Da besieged Zhang Shicheng in Suzhou for a long time, and after nine months, he still could not conquer it. Someone offered a plan, saying, "The city of Suzhou is in the shape of a turtle. Attacking all six points simultaneously will only make it stronger. It is better to choose one point to attack quickly, which may break it." At that time, it so happened that Shicheng had a trusted confidant named Li Situ, who secretly sent someone to Xu Da's army to surrender. Thus, Xu Da was able to attack through Changmen and enter the city.</p>
<p>Changmen has always been known as prosperous, while Fengmen is extremely desolate. Being the same city gate, why is there such a difference? There is a small anecdote behind this: After Xu Da attacked through Changmen and entered the city, he did not kill a single person, and was hailed as a benevolent and righteous army. At that time, Chang Yuchun was annoyed that the city had not been broken for so long, and he attacked through Fengmen, sparing even three-year-old children. Although Xu Da hurriedly sent someone with a token to stop him, the Fengmen area had already suffered the pain of bloodshed. Therefore, Fengmen is uniquely desolate, while Changmen is extremely prosperous, and it is still like this today.</p>
<p>Even today, the people of Suzhou still have lingering thoughts of Zhang Shicheng, a native of Suzhou. On the thirtieth day of the seventh lunar month, every household burns Nine Thoughts Incense, which is to commemorate his kindness and virtue. When Suzhou was not defended and about to fall, Shicheng's mother said to him, "My son, you have failed. What about my words?" Shicheng then drove all his relatives up to Qiyun Tower and set it on fire. He alone did not die, saying, "I am saving the lives of the people in the city." Then, he surrendered himself. This is a great tragedy in the local history of Suzhou.</p>
<p>Suzhou was anciently known as "Gusu." According to historical records, Gusu was originally Guxu, and both the terrace and the mountain were named after Wu Zixu. In the Wu dialect, "Xu" is mistakenly pronounced as "Su," hence the name "Gusu." Another theory is that after the state of Wu was destroyed, Gusu Terrace was also abandoned, and only Xu Mountain remained. Therefore, it was called "Gu Xu." Later, "Xu" was mistakenly pronounced as "Su," and "Gu" was mistaken for "Gu," hence the name "Gusu."</p>
<p>The dry city gate of Fengmen was once renamed "Little East Gate" during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era. The original stone drawbridge was also dismantled at that time. Gunboats were stationed in the city river to provide defense. There is a small典故about Suzhou having a Little East Gate. In another twenty or thirty years, I am afraid no one will know about it, so I am recording it.</p>
<h3>The Nighttime West Lake in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, the nighttime West Lake becomes bustling due to the hot summer.</p>
<p>Especially on the eighteenth day of the sixth lunar month.</p>
<p>The eighteenth day of the sixth lunar month is the birthday of Guan Yin, the Goddess of Mercy. Therefore, old ladies must chant their prayers, and West Lake must, as usual, have a night of lotus lanterns!</p>
<p>According to the elderly, in the Qing dynasty, all three city gates would be opened all night long, and officials from the provincial governor and down would have to tour the lake and celebrate until dawn, just like ordinary people!</p>
<p>Naturally, this year it cannot be called off due to droughts and floods. Qianyi Commercial Building had already bought the finest fireworks from Huizhou for a thousand yuan to add to the excitement of West Lake on the eighteenth day of the sixth lunar month. It was published in the newspaper, and people were stirred up like a tidal wave.</p>
<p>Thus, this year's West Lake night on the eighteenth day of the sixth lunar month is even more lively and vibrant!</p>
<p>I was also pulled along by a friend to make up the numbers.</p>
<p>We entered the Sixth Park on the lakeside around 9:30. However, the tourists at this time were already as dense as white ants, stepping on each other's heels. The unpleasant scent of powder mixed with sweat filled the air, making one feel nauseous.</p>
<p>I heard that the fireworks would be launched at ten o'clock. As the time approached, it suddenly started to rain. The people in the park were instantly in chaos, pushing and shoving towards the gate. Some of the bolder ones still lay on the grass, leisurely watching the dark clouds in the sky, some round and some square.</p>
<p>The rain became lighter. The firework架子called "Fa Bao," which cost a thousand yuan and was erected on the water, was very high. One by one, snakelike Huizhou fireworks shot straight into the sky, fiery red!</p>
<p>"Oh, the fireworks are here! The fireworks are here!"</p>
<p>In the midst of this cheering, many tourists re-entered the gate. The lakeside park was once again crowded!</p>
<p>The sky was clear, and the moon brought coolness to the sky. West Lake was even more beautiful! Red lights flickered around the lake, and the ripples were so interesting!</p>
<p>Several silver bell-like singing voices floated from the surface of the lake, engraved in everyone's hearts.</p>
<p>Ah, here there is no drought! No flood!</p>
<h3>Secret That Flew Here</h3>
<p>— Shi Cheng</p>
<p>The scenery of West Lake is elegant and refined, unparalleled in its ordinariness; whether lightly adorned or heavily painted, it is always suitable. I once ascended the Chuyang Terrace, overlooking the entire West Lake; the dikes draped with green willows, the waves reflecting the mountain light, Buddhist temples hidden in the verdant peaks, the sound of bells occasionally heard from the monasteries, it was as if one had entered a painting, no longer having the atmosphere of worldly life! It is said that among the scenic spots around the lake, Yunlin is the most outstanding; the Lingyin Flying Peak, in particular, is full of strange rocks and wondrous peaks! These words, I quite agree with.</p>
<p>A Line of Sky is at the foot of the Flying Peak, where the rock crevice is as thin as a line, faintly protecting the light of the sky. Looking up, Buddhist images appear in the middle, some ugly, some beautiful, some golden, some red; what each traveler sees is different. Virtuous men and believing women then say that our Buddha is spiritual, revealing this sacred迹象; the incense in the Buddhist temples greatly increases as a result. Little do they know that to see the Tathagata through form and appearance is already a violation of the Buddhist commandment of walking the evil path. Yet the monks still widely promote this to deceive the common people. Alas, the depth of superstition among people is profound!</p>
<p>Master Jizhao is my friend. He is outstanding and refined, free and unrestrained from the mundane world. Once, on a moonlit night, he and I answered the invitation of Yao Ziyuan and drank at his residence. Yao Zi is fond of cultivating flowers. Ascending his terrace, it was like entering a land of fragrant flowers. Sipping wine under the moon was especially interesting. We had a leisurely conversation, enjoying ourselves and forgetting fatigue. When we were halfway through the wine, I casually asked him about it. The master rolled his eyes and said, "This is just a deceiving trick. Why are you so confused by it?" I laughed and thanked him, and asked him for the reason. The master said: "The peaks and rocks are exquisite, with many holes. The monks choose the larger ones and place windmills inside. Buddhist images are molded on all eight sides, with different clothing and colors. When the wind comes through the rock crevice, it spins continuously. Looking up from below, one can only see a line, so the Buddhist image reflected in the eyes changes with time. If one were to climb to the top of the peak and look down through the rock crevice, the true appearance would be revealed. As years pass, those who know the truth become few, and they are surprised to believe it is a divine phenomenon. Isn't that confusing?" Yao Zi said: "The technique is indeed ingenious! Aren't you afraid that tourists will discover the truth?" The master said: "There are too many rock crevices, making it difficult to find them. Moreover, the top of the peak is covered with thorns, which is enough to hinder the feet of tourists." These were the master's words. Is it a Zhuangzi allegory? Or is it something he actually saw? It cannot be known. I will record it and wait for future verification.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Sketches</h3>
<p>— Wei Ji</p>
<p>Suzhou, called the paradise of Suzhou. I think everyone is envious of the people living in Suzhou.</p>
<p>Suzhou, called paradise in the past, truly deserved the name. But now, Suzhou has also suffered from unemployment panic and economic bankruptcy. It is no longer as enviable as before.</p>
<p>Now I will talk about the Suzhou of today.</p>
<p>Guanqian Street, the most prosperous street in paradise. Now it is covered with banners advertising big discounts. Every store uses radio to broadcast beautiful music and humorous talks, hoping to attract pedestrians to stop, but business is still slow.</p>
<p>In the cinemas, first-class films are being shown at the lowest prices. But the place is still deserted, with few spectators.</p>
<p>In the job centers, there are many women from the countryside. Their husbands have been affected by the economic bankruptcy in the countryside, and they have been told to come to the city to make a living.</p>
<p>On Jinchang Road, there are many women lined up next to the hotels every night, selling their bodies and looking for their customers for the night.</p>
<p>In short, paradise has felt the recession, and perhaps it will turn into hell in the future!</p>
<h3>Nighttime Congee Shops in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Jin Xi</p>
<p>The Yanling Road area in Hangzhou is the concentration point for nighttime congee shops. The nighttime congee shops on this street all employ young female attendants. The old bosses of the congee shops use the charm and smiles of women to attract customers and expand their business. By analogy, the nature of Hangzhou's nighttime congee shops is similar to that of Shanghai's Jiafei 座 (a type of bar).</p>
<p>Although they are called congee shops, in terms of their business scope, they are actually a disguised form of restaurant. Those young and beautiful female attendants are the most capable people in the shop to promote wine and dishes. Relying solely on a few bowls of congee and a few plates of side dishes, the bosses' profits are minimal. They rely entirely on the female attendants' attentive service to those customers who are slightly色躁 (sexually restless). They have a kind of charm that is enough to urge customers to order a few side dishes that they do not necessarily need, and the price of these side dishes is so expensive.</p>
<p>Those who frequent nighttime congee shops are mostly car drivers, store clerks, retired military police, and perhaps a few wealthy people, gentlemen, adults, painters, and government officials, but these are in the minority. The working hours of nighttime congee shop female attendants start at one o'clock in the afternoon and end at twelve o'clock at night. From one o'clock to seven o'clock in the afternoon, there are very few customers who are willing to spend money. When night falls and the electric lights are brilliant, customers of all sorts gather in the nighttime congee shop to drink, order dishes, wave their fists, tease the female attendants, and act out all kinds of ugly scenes. When the wine is drunk and the ears are hot, the customers' hands will travel over every part of the female attendants' bodies. They will not refuse, they know that the customers are coming for this benefit.</p>
<p>In an unreasonable society, there is no reasonable life. From this alone, one can know how low the personality of Hangzhou poor women is in their profession.</p>
<h3>West Lake Restaurant</h3>
<p>— (Bo Guang)</p>
<p>Alcohol can excite nerves and promote blood circulation. Drinking a little can indeed have incredible effects. Restaurants with the sign "Taibai Sends the Wind" can be seen everywhere, whether in big cities or in rural areas. Ordinary drinkers are immersed in 곡藥 (wine) all day long, neglecting their proper business, which loses the purpose of drinking.</p>
<p>West Lake has dozens of restaurants, all with girls serving at the stove, and several of them have not bad looks. Friends who drink wine often drink slowly and carefully, reluctant to leave. They are not interested in the wine, but are already thinking about the non-essentials!</p>
<p>Using female attendants in restaurants is indeed a good way to attract customers. To put it bluntly, "wine is the matchmaker of sex." Wine and sex are indeed related!</p>
<h3>Women Carrying Sedan Chairs Under Mount Tianping in Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Zhu Weiming</p>
<p>Before the boat reached the foot of Mount Tianping, two or three strong women emerged from the thatched cottages under the green shade on the opposite shore. As soon as they saw the boat docking by the stone bridge, they jumped and ran to the shore, vying to say, "Do you want a sedan chair? Take a sedan chair up the mountain!" The soft and gentle Wu dialect sounds more pleasing than jazz music.</p>
<p>I stood on the bow of the boat, the duckweed leaning against my shoulder, and said to them with a smile, "We do want a sedan chair, but we need to eat before we go up the mountain." They knew that their hopes would not be dashed, so they all laughed and said, "Oh! Then we will go eat too." They all twisted their嬌軀 (pretty bodies) and ran away lightly, disappearing behind the green shadows. When we had barely finished half of our lunch, a young woman in her twenties had already returned to the shore to wait. She quietly sat on a white stone protruding from the water, her dark and large eyes, full and strong waist, revealed a small mouth staring at us. After a while, she suddenly smiled, and then splashed the blue-green waves with her palms, her figure reflected in the waves, trembling with the gurgling ripples.</p>
<p>We hired a total of four sedan chairs to go up the mountain. Women accounted for six of the sedan chair carriers. They were equally strong and had the same beautiful faces. They were also very young, only seventeen or eighteen to twenty years old. Two of them were young girls, the rosy clouds on their peach blossom cheeks showing that they were in their most moving and lovable time, but the burden of life had already been placed on their shoulders. 牛馬般的(Isn't carrying a sedan chair an inhuman life?) Labor drove them to struggle on the road of life. The other two men were a pair of captives from the city of smoke. They were exhausted, weak, and wretched. From their words and titles, it sounded like this pair of smokers were the husbands of the two young women inside.</p>
<p>After crossing two hills, about ten miles, we sat comfortably in the sedan chairs and already felt a little tired from the bumps. The pair of smokers were of course completely useless and exhausted. But the six women were always flying on foot. But the sweat had already rolled down from their foreheads to their mouths like a tide, soaking their necks and backs, seeping into their clothes and pants, and their whole bodies were as if they had taken a bath, emitting a vigorous heat. They immediately took off their coats, leaving only a short shirt, their full breasts抖抖地 (shaking), as if they were about to jump out of their shirts. A young woman carrying me was wiping the sweat hanging straight down her face with one hand, and rolling up her trouser legs with the other. "Ah! The sweat has soaked the color off my pants, look at how messy my thighs are!" It turned out that she was wearing blue cloth pants, and she rolled up her trouser legs high, her thighs fully exposed, and she just laughed foolishly, raising her face.</p>
<p>The women carrying sedan chairs on Mount Tianping are highly praised by tourists, and I think this must include the relationship of the labor union environment. So I took this opportunity to ask them in detail about their living conditions. According to them, because there are many mountains nearby, the productivity of the land is weak, and the mountain fields are worthless. There is also nothing produced on the mountains, so the men have nothing to do and sit in tea houses all day long chatting, and most of them are addicted to opium and red pills. The only work they can find is to open mountains and dig stones for people. However, none of the men who work as mountain openers do not eat opium or swallow red pills. Their wages are one yuan for three days, but their opium consumption, one yuan is only enough for two days. So not only their food, clothing, and housing expenses, but also their opium, must be forced to be provided by their wives, who are made to work like cattle and horses, and their wives' blood and sweat must be exhausted to swallow it. In addition to carrying sedan chairs, women also engage in embroidery as a side business, which is almost their inherited skill, and they embroider figures, flowers, and birds with extraordinary exquisiteness. The Gu Embroidery sold in the Shanghai market is actually all their production. Gu Embroidery shops send people to the countryside to deliver the work to be done to them, agree on a time to collect it, and the wages are extremely low, usually only two or three hundred 文 (cash) a day. Therefore, as soon as they see tourists going up the mountain, they rush to carry sedan chairs, although it is hard work, at least they can always earn a few毛 (cents).</p>
<p>The ladies who return from touring Mount Tianping only hear them praise the women carrying sedan chairs for their beauty and strength, or at most feel a little surprised. How do they know that their actual lives are so painful! Those who pay attention to women's issues can refer to it.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<p>U.S. to Nationalize Silver</p>
<h3>Gold Market Presents a Chaotic Situation</h3>
<p>Deferred Delivery Premium Rises, Major Short Sellers Anxious About Recovery to One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was in a state of chaos due to the US government's announcement that it would nationalize silver. There was a potential short squeeze, and prices were extremely firm after a period of weakness. In the morning, the overseas silver market, both in the UK and the US, saw a sharp rise. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange, due to the government announcement, was set at US$0.5001 per ounce, with all months priced at US$0.4996, an increase of between 0.011 and 0.096. London spot gold rose by half a penny, and exchange rates also rose significantly. US cotton rose 19 points, and US wheat rose 1.5 cents. Market sentiment remained cautious. However, some believed that with the US government's silver nationalization price set at US$0.5001, the US silver price would be fixed around US$0.50, lacking the potential for a sharp rise. Therefore, off-exchange trading was extremely chaotic. Raw material prices initially rose strongly from 49 yuan, then retreated to 41 yuan, before recovering. Gold firms' preliminary trading started at 43.4 yuan and gradually rose. After opening, banks' appetite was unstable, both buying near-term and selling far-term. Although sentiment was positive, prices only fluctuated, with intense struggles. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announced its exchange rates, with the British pound up 1.25 and the US dollar up 0.5 yuan. The domestic market loosened. Reuters reported from New York that after the government's silver nationalization, there would be measures such as increasing silver certificates, creating silver coins, and increasing the silver reserve ratio to 3:1. The gold market remained weak, but due to the high deferred delivery premium for August, sentiment remained positive and the situation relatively stable. Despite constant rumors of silver nationalization, prices struggled to rise. Later, short sellers repeatedly covered their positions, and the availability of shares in the market dried up. Reuters reported from London that it was surprised by the US government's silver nationalization price of US$0.5001 and predicted that there would be two silver markets, one in New York and the other in the rest of the world, with different conditions. US silver miners claimed that the government's price was too low, considering it unfavorable news. Sentiment suddenly rallied, breaking through the 50 yuan mark. The deferred delivery premium for August even saw short sellers paying out 11 yuan. As the expiration date approached, short sellers panicked, and buying became even more intense, causing a sharp short squeeze and a rapid rise. Reuters also reported that the London Haiti Company announced that they would continue to use silver to meet industrial needs. Prices rose high and then retreated, but because sentiment had solidified, the afternoon closing was quite strong. In the after-market, Mumbai rose 5.5.5 annas. The Associated Press reported that the US was buying silver abroad. The market immediately softened, and Reuters later reported similar news, stating that it resembled inflation. Speculator Wu sold aggressively, causing another round of declines, retreating back below 50 yuan. However, due to the efforts of the Guangdong trading houses to maintain prices, they managed to pull them back up. Mumbai also rose slightly by 1.1.1 annas and then strengthened again. However, after the price increase, the supply remained plentiful. Prices then traded flat with much struggle. With the spot delivery for August not arriving, the deferred delivery premium suddenly rose to over 10 yuan. With the expiration date approaching, short sellers remained anxious, resulting in a day's market situation marked by a significant short squeeze.</p>
<p>The market opened in the morning at 946.7 yuan, down 4.5 yuan from the previous close. Material prices opened at 7.3 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened with recent asking prices of 1 shilling 4.75 pence for the British pound and 35.4375 yuan for the US dollar. The Dalian trading house and Hengyu bought up to 8 yuan. Fuxingyong and Dafayong sold. The Yokohama Specie Bank and Mercantile Bank offered US dollars for September delivery at 4375, which dropped to 5.8 yuan. Banque Belge pour l'Etranger and Citibank bought US dollars for November delivery at 6875. Huixiang, Dadecheng, Dingkang, Zhaofengchang bought, and prices rose again to 7.5 yuan. It was anticipated that HSBC would announce its exchange rates, with the British pound up 1.25 and the US dollar up 0.5 yuan. Shunmao, Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Yongqian, Changxiang, and Tongchun sold, retreating to 5.2 yuan. The Bank of England bought US dollars for November delivery at 75. Shen, Daqing, Fayong, Dadecheng took positions, rising to 6.7 yuan. Fuxingyong, Hengyu, Fuyu, Dalian trading house, and Zhaofengchang sold again and prices fell again. Yuanmao, Yongda, and Dadecheng continuously bought, resulting in a recovery. As US dollars for November delivery at 75 were difficult to sell, Tianfengyong and Shenkang Tianfeng sold to 4.3 yuan. Dachangxiang and Yuanmao Yong took advantage of the low prices to buy positions and stabilize. After entering the market, Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, Hengxingyuan, Qingyu, Fuyu, Dachangxiang, Yuanmao, Yong, Yuqing, and Yongfen bought and prices rose to 9.5 yuan. Fuxingyong and Dingtai were still selling, retreating to 8.2 yuan. Market sentiment was already feeling the pressure, and the available shares in the market dried up, triggering a sudden rebound. News from London was slightly favorable. Dadecheng, Yifengyong, Richang, Qingyu, Yuanmao, Yong, Fuxingyong, Hengxingyuan, Zhengchang, and others all bought, rising to 53.5 yuan. Ruixing, Qianchangxiang, and Yicheng provided some supply, gradually retreating to 1.2 yuan. After entering the market, market sentiment had become extremely strong. US dollars for November delivery at 6875 were difficult to close out. Shen, Daheng, Yu, Huixiang, Zhaofengchang, Dingchang, Qianchangxiang, Yuanmao, Yong, Yuanchun, Daxingyong and others bought aggressively, rising to 7.8 yuan. Fuan, Dadecheng, Shunmao, Tongchun, Fuxingyong, and Yuqingyong jointly sold, and the gold market gradually fell to 4.2 yuan. Futaiheng, Qingfayong, Shen, Yu, Fuxingyong, and others then came to buy. Sellers disappeared from the market, and the supply dried up, rising further to 8.3 yuan. Yuanyi Shunmao sold at a high price, and the market calmed down. The afternoon closing was 957.4 yuan, and material prices traded at 6.5 yuan. The market was slightly flat after closing.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 954.9 yuan. Off-exchange trading initially traded at 5.5-6 yuan. Mumbai rose 5 annas. The Associated Press reported that the US would buy silver abroad. Material prices opened at 4.7 yuan. Banque Belge pour l'Etranger offered US dollars for November delivery at half a yuan. Hengyu, Qianchangxiang, Fuxingyong, Huixiang, Yuanchangyong, and others all sold, falling from 5 yuan to 3.3 yuan. Chosun offered US dollars for November delivery at 5625. Hengyu, Dadecheng, and Dalian trading house took positions, rising to 4.2 yuan. Reuters reported that London newspapers commented that the US government's continued purchase of silver abroad was close to inflation. Market sentiment became cautious again. Speculator Wu sold aggressively. Chunyuan Yong, Yuqingyong, Hengyu, Yuanmao Yong, Yuanyi Yifengyong, Hengchangyong, Shunmao Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng Hengxingyuan sold off one after another and broke the 50 yuan mark. US dollars for November delivery at 75 were difficult to sell. After this, there was a struggle around the 50 yuan mark. However, Huixiang and Daxingyong continued to sell, and prices fell to 48 yuan. Guangdong trading houses took advantage of the cheap prices to buy. Hengxing bought aggressively, again breaking through the 50 yuan mark. Mitsui bought US dollars for December delivery at 875. Dadecheng and others bought up to 51.9 yuan. Although banks were buying near-term, the Dalian trading house provided some supply, and prices fell again to around 50 yuan. Dadecheng, Yuqingyong, Zhaofengchang, and Xiangxingyong continued to buy. Mumbai recovered by a small 1 anna, rising to 53.7 yuan. Hengyu and Dadecheng Yuan sold, retreating to 1.5 yuan. Yuqingyong, Shen, Dafuxingyong, and Dadecheng bought one after another, and prices rose to 2.5 yuan. Qianchangxiang continued to sell, and the situation remained weak. The closing price was 952.2 yuan. Material prices traded at 2 yuan. After the closing, Shen, Dayuanchangyong, and Yuqingyong continued to buy, initially rising to over 3 yuan. Yuanyi and Fuyu suddenly sold, and prices retreated back to below 2 yuan. The highest price for the day was 958.3 yuan, and the lowest price was 944.3 yuan, resulting in a fluctuation of 24 yuan. The net result was an increase of 1 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price, due to HSBC's US dollar exchange rate rising by half a yuan, was 35 yuan, resulting in a standard gold price of 988 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was discounted by about 36 yuan, a decrease of about 15 yuan from the previous close. August's registered price was 962 yuan, and September's was 957 yuan. The morning supplementary deposit was 962 yuan, and the afternoon supplementary deposit was 957 yuan. The price of pure gold was estimated at 963.7 yuan, an increase of about 17 yuan. The gold price fell significantly. Customer trading houses had no supply because after a certain trading house in Tianjin worked to raise prices, the difference with the prices in Shanghai was too large, and the source was cut off. As a result, the short positions previously sold by the Tianjin trading houses could not be closed out at a high price. The deferred delivery premium rose to 10 yuan, completely paid out by the Tianjin trading houses. In the market, Fuxingyong paid Wanxing 70 positions at 11 yuan. Yuqingyong paid Shunli and Wanxing 560 positions each at 12.3 yuan. Yingfengheng paid Fuchang 70 positions at 13 yuan. Fuxingyong paid Wanxing 105 positions at 13.5 yuan. In addition, August saw frequent transfers of accounts, with Shunli transferring 217 positions to Yingfengheng, Qianchangxiang transferring 210 positions to Dadecheng at 62 yuan, Dadecheng and Shunli each transferring 70 positions to Yingfengheng, and Yuqingyong transferring 148 positions to Yingfengheng at the same price. Fuxingyong transferred 105 positions to Yingfengheng at 65 yuan. The number of positions cleared by public order today was 168 by Yingfengheng. The number of positions received was 119 by Fuchang, 35 by Wanxing, and 14 by Shunli. There were still 2,646 positions remaining for this month.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was extremely active. In summary, Dadecheng, Yuanmao Yong Hengxing, Yiyu, Dadecheng, Dingkang, Dingchang, Changshengyong, Hongxing, Qingfayong, Futaiheng, Fuchang, Zhaofengchang, Yuanshengyong, Yuanmaochang, Changwufengyong, Shen, Da, and Shunli were primarily on the buying side.

<h3>Silver Dollar Market Actually Improves</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silver dollar market, although superficially showing no progress, with both the Yangchao short-term lending rate and the head-shaving premium remaining at 7 fen and the additional premium still at 4 fen, showing no change compared to the previous day, actually saw a significant improvement compared to the white lending and white transfers of the past few months. As the autumn goods are about to enter the market, silver dollar usage is increasing, so various market prices are able to remain firm. However, as the peak season for preparing goods has not yet arrived, the market atmosphere is naturally not very strong. Short-term lending transactions saw a total of over 3.5 million in the morning trading and new transactions, and over 200,000 in the afternoon. The small general meeting saw over 300,000 in transactions. Silver dollar pledge transactions saw 900,000 in redemptions and 1.2 million in new transactions. Bank receipts and payments included over 1.4 million in bills and payments for foreign banks, over 400,000 in telegraphic transfers, 3.9 million in receipts and payments for various goods, foreign exchange collateral, and miscellaneous items, and 600,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Chinese banks saw over 2 million in receipts and payments for bills and payments, over 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 500,000 in customs duties, 4.1 million in receipts and payments for various goods, foreign exchange collateral, and miscellaneous items, and 300,000 in warehouse entries. Japanese banks saw over 1.6 million in receipts and payments for bills and payments, over 3.3 million in receipts and payments for various goods, foreign exchange collateral, and miscellaneous items, and 500,000 in warehouse entries. Money shops' receipts and payments for Yang public orders totaled over 46.6 million, receipts and payments for Yang head-shaving premiums totaled over 4.8 million, receipts for various types of foreign exchange totaled over 800,000, banknote receipts and payments totaled over 2.3 million, cash payments totaled over 400,000, and receipts and payments from customer routes totaled 200,000 each.

<h3>Subsidiary Currency Reveals Slight Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small foreign coins were slightly better by 2 jiao compared to the previous day, with both morning and afternoon markets at 835.2 yuan. The morning market saw transactions of 3,000 jiao, and there were no transactions in the afternoon. Guangdong small foreign coins were only better by 3 jiao compared to the previous day, with the morning market trading at 727.8 yuan and the afternoon market trading at 727.9 yuan. Total transactions were 80,000 jiao in the morning and 45,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins also increased by 1,000 jiao compared to the previous market, to 332.5 thousand cash, with a transaction value of 11,500 foreign yuan, equivalent to 38,237 strings of cash.</p>
<p>The General Speculative Fever for Grain Has Not Yet Subsided</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Initially Rise Then Fall</h3>
<p>The difference between rising and falling prices in the flour market still has a difference of around 1 jiao. The chaotic situation in the market has not yet escaped the deterioration of speculative fever. After the opening of the market in the morning, with the price of foreign wheat reported, Chicago continued to improve by around 4-5 jiao, and Canada improved by around 2-3 jiao. Those enthusiastic people could not avoid stirring up trouble again, engaging in fluctuations. In addition, the northern sales groups, due to the ease of profit, were inevitably somewhat speculative. The opening price in the morning immediately saw a sharp jump, with the current month opening at 8 jiao 1 fen, and soon jumping to 8 jiao 4 fen, an increase of nearly 1 jiao compared to the previous day. September jumped to 8 jiao 5 fen, an increase of 9 fen. Other months also increased by 3-5-6 fen. Because groups from Dalian and Yingkou opened with smooth purchases, the rising wind was even greater. However, after this rising wind, all saw a fall back, as those making profits stepped back. The atmosphere on all sides was not as enthusiastic as before, so the second round saw a fall back of 3-4 fen for near-term and a fall of 1-2 fen for far-term. By the time the afternoon market opened, the market situation had changed greatly again, with the long positions gloomy and the sellers slightly more lively. As the government's flour loans were able to be imported on schedule, and the factories had preparations to order foreign wheat, market sentiment was greatly deflated, and the decline was significant. Customer long positions were also reported to be stepping back, resulting in an especially weak far-term market. Observing this situation, the rise was soaring and the fall was also rapid. Although half was promoted by demand, the majority of the components were ultimately manipulated by speculation. As a result, the current month was better by 2 fen, September fell by 1 fen, October fell by half a fen, November fell by one and a half fen, December fell by 2 fen, and January fell by 3.75 fen.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the market for each month saw an enthusiastic state again. With the price of foreign wheat reported, Chicago improved by around 4-5 jiao, and Canada improved by around 2-3 jiao. After the opening, the situation for foreign wheat improved, and the domestic spot goods were easily hoarded by hoarders, so the opening price for the current month was again high at 4 jiao 2 fen, September to 5 jiao 4 fen, October to 5 jiao 2 fen, November to 5 jiao 4 fen, and December to 6 jiao 3 fen, an improvement of 1 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. Then, because customers stepped back and large traders also exited, a step-by-step reverse fall was seen. By the time the afternoon market opened, sentiment for the current month was stepping back into weakness. October and below still brought an expensive and strong trend. Because at this point, all the short positions inside and outside the industry did not dare to try to sell the far-term. As a result, the current month was lower by 2 jiao 8 fen, and small 4 fen worse than the previous day, September remained the same, October was 5 fen better, November was 7 fen better, and December was 6 fen better. The spot wheat market was fatigued with standard grain, and the opening price was slightly flat. However, the majority of goods were held by insiders, and excessive selling was not easy for a while. The opening price for Yaowan wheat and Suzhou Xuzhou wheat was 4.35 yuan, and the opening price for Daqiao wheat was 4.27 yuan, for a total of 10,000 bags opened.</p>
<h3>Hubei and Jiangxi Compete to Handle Customer Rice</h3>
<p>丨Zhangzhou New Rice Arrives in Shanghai丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market was quite lively. In terms of arrivals, there were recent scattered arrivals from various routes. Because Shanghai prices rose, various places came after hearing the news. For example, new Wenzhou rice also arrived, totaling 731 bags, and was all handled by inland Jiujiang. Also, new Zhangzhou rice arrived, including 1,428 bags of milled rice and 84 bags of brown rice. The rice grains were round and short, similar to Jiangsu and Zhejiang japonica rice. After arriving in Shanghai, it was competed for by various groups from Beiyang and Hankou in this street. All were cleared, as the goods were close to Du japonica rice. The milled rice opened at 11.78 yuan, followed by 11.65 yuan. The brown rice also reached 9.8 yuan. The new Wenzhou rice also reached 9.45 yuan. A total of 5,200 bags of milled Jing and other varieties were traded. The price of milled Jing rice reached 10.08 yuan. Shashi milled rice was 10 yuan, and brown rice was 8.35 yuan. Zhenjiang milled rice was 9.85 yuan, Jiangbei brown rice was 9.2 yuan, and Wuxi Bu Xian rice was 10.05 yuan. A small amount of rice opened for 3,000 bags, priced at 10.06 yuan. 600 bags of Saigon No. 1 opened, priced at 11.65 yuan. Yesterday, except for Saigon rice, which was new and slightly lower in price, all other rice rebounded by fen to jiao. Because various groups were very keen to buy, in addition to Beiyang, Jiujiang, and inland groups, there were also Hankou buyers. Jiujiang's purchase volume was very large, and the follow-up still required continued smooth purchases.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Bond Trading Temporarily Stands by and Watches</h3>
<p>丨A Situation of Waiting for Opportunity丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange still fluctuated without progress. Although Huang Fu had returned to office, the market did not care because it was expected. The selling of the Beiyang groups was the most active, with most of them being floating longs leaving the market. The buying of No. 4 was extremely active, but it was said to be acting on behalf of others. Initially, there were signs of a recovery, but it was still not vigorous due to the selling pressure being too strong. After repeated fluctuations, a large fluctuation will occur after the middle of the month. Yesterday's process saw a slight rebound at the opening. The front row was slightly better by 5 fen to 2 jiao and a half. The middle twenty-volume, twenty-customs, and unified salt tax all did not improve, but instead decreased by 1 jiao to 3 jiao. When it was slightly higher, there were sellers, and when it was slightly lower, there were buyers. Both sides held each other back, with both having the intention to take advantage of the opportunity. At the close, most rebounded by 1 jiao to 3 jiao. The market price resulted in mixed gains and losses, with a rise and fall of about 1 jiao to 3-4 jiao. In terms of transactions, groups such as Nos. 11, 14, and 35 sold the most, and No. 5 also sold a lot. In terms of buying, No. 4 bought the most, and the rest were retail investors. The total number of transactions was 8,622,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the comparative table on the left. (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Enthusiastically Trending Upward</h3>
<p>According to a report from Sin Feng Trading Company, yesterday (the 9th), the New York Stock Exchange, small exchanges, and commodity markets all surged vigorously. This was because silver was nationalized, which was generally seen as a precursor to inflation. President Roosevelt had previously delivered a speech favoring short positions, but the sound of his words was still in our ears when he took the swift action of nationalizing silver. This was truly beyond the expectations of Wall Street figures. When the news arrived, speculators were shocked and couldn't stop. Within an hour before the market closed, a strong buying trend developed on the exchange. The ticker tape lagged behind the market by as much as three minutes. All stocks rose in unison, with silver stocks and stocks benefiting from inflation being particularly strong. The surge reached around five dollars. At the same time, the bond market also became the focus of speculators' attention. The lively atmosphere evoked memories of the days of the Great War. Total trading volume for the day reached 21.76 million yuan, but transactions in the final hour alone reached 14.6 million yuan. As Wall Street studied and interpreted the situation, prices also rose and fell rapidly, creating exceptional confusion. Once it was recognized as inflationary, it immediately declined sharply, only showing improvement before the close. Some believed this was due to government intervention behind the scenes. U.S. government bonds initially rose slightly, but the results were mixed. The U.S. dollar fell sharply due to selling from Europe, also attributed to inflation as silver prices stabilized. Grains reached new highs due to the heat in the Midwest. Total trading volume for the day was 1.42 million shares. The Dow Jones New York indices are listed below:</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn: Both Bulls and Bears Hesitant and Uneasy</p>
<h3>Complex Process of Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market's situation changed three times a day, becoming increasingly complex. Both bulls and bears were in a state of frantic disarray, demonstrating the unsettled minds of speculators. When prices rose, buyers went wild; when news was bad, sellers were numerous. However, it was found that factories hedged a significant amount in recent days. Today, the market situation appeared slightly calmer, not as intense as the previous day.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Hesitates, Slight Increase</h3>
<p>The standard yarn market opened in the morning, with U.S. cotton rising again. Although factories had hedged the previous day, the decline was too severe, leading to profit-taking. Yesterday, the market turned upward. Front-month contracts rose by 0.67 to 1.23 yuan. In the second session, market prices suddenly changed, as factories hedged again, and selling pressure rose again. Contracts for all months suddenly fell by 0.89 yuan to 1 yuan. The third session remained weak. It was heard that spot yarn sales were still good, and contracts for all months rebounded by 0.67 yuan. As a result, contracts for all months rose by 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.6 yuan. The total trading volume was 43,900 bales. Sales included: Da Feng 1,100 bales, Qin Xing 700 bales, Jin Chang 600 bales, Ming Hua 600 bales, Shen Chang 1,000 bales, Da Fu 1,000 bales, Yi Cheng 1,850 bales, Chang Feng 1,250 bales, Run Kang 2,250 bales, and Xie Sheng 700 bales. Purchases included: Ji Feng 1,650 bales, Tong Ji 1,650 bales, Heng Yi 650 bales, Hui Kang 900 bales, Sen Kang 800 bales, Tong Feng 2,950 bales, Chang Yu 1,400 bales, Yuan De 1,200 bales, Xie Cheng 900 bales, and Yong Chang 1,650 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn High Price Low Price Closing Price Rise/Fall Remaining Balance</p>

<p>Total 292,100</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales 1,000 Bales</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales were still good. Statistics show that various groups bought a total of 1,000 bales throughout the day, with prices rising by 0.5 yuan. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 75 Guangdong 105 Changsha 400 Jiangxi 90 Ningbo 15</p>
<p>Haizhou 50 Tianjin 100 Nanyang 70 Shantou 40 North Group 10</p>
<h3>Standard Cotton Selling Pressure Increasingly Intense</h3>
<p>The cotton market was relatively weak. As new cotton gradually entered the market, bearish sentiment was quite strong, and selling increased daily. As for factories, there was still no procurement activity. Therefore, although U.S. cotton rose and silver also rose, most discussions about the domestic cotton production situation were hopeful. Thus, the market was difficult to move upward. However, based on the foreign cotton situation, it was still difficult to fall significantly.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Cotton Falls Another 0.25 Yuan</h3>
<p>The standard cotton market opened in the morning. Before the auction, most people expected prices to rise, as U.S. cotton rose again, and Indian cotton's rise was even more intense. Unexpectedly, sellers gathered in the auction market, and the market atmosphere was quite loose. New cotton was slightly tighter in the first session, rising by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. In the second session, the cotton market was even weaker as the yarn market declined, and buyers were scarce, with all months falling by 0.4 yuan. In the third session, short positions were covered for profit-taking, rebounding by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. As a result, all months fell by 0.2 to 0.25 yuan. Total trading volume was 125,800 bales. Sales included: Run Kang 10,300 piculs, Chang Ji 2,400 piculs, Da Fu 3,800 piculs, Tong Ji 2,400 piculs, Shen Chang 7,400 piculs, Yuan Da 1,700 piculs, Sen Kang 2,600 piculs, Yuan Yi 2,300 piculs, Chang Feng 3,300 piculs, Xie Cheng 1,900 piculs, Xie Sheng 2,100 piculs, and Yi Feng 3,100 piculs. Purchases included: Ji Feng 2,300 piculs, Mei Ji 1,900 piculs, Da Feng 3,300 piculs, Sui Long 1,500 piculs, Hui Kang 2,400 piculs, Geng Feng 1,300 piculs, Rui Da 1,700 piculs, Jun Chang 3,700 piculs, Yuan Feng 3,000 piculs, Heng De 2,200 piculs, Ren Feng 2,800 piculs, Yi Cheng 4,500 piculs, Yi Chang 3,900 piculs, De Ji 3,000 piculs, Yuan Xing Chang 2,400 piculs, and Chang He 4,100 piculs.

<p>Spot cotton sales remained sluggish. Japanese merchants slightly increased purchases.</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Continues to Rise by 20 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was initially weak due to mass selling, but then strengthened due to drought in the arid regions and silver issues favoring long positions.

<h3>"Beauties" and "Talents"</h3>
<p>— Wang Ren</p>
<p>An era inevitably produces a special kind of person; this is a certain principle. Since ancient times, China has had emperors in every dynasty, with many heroes and famous scholars assisting them. At the same time, many ornamental figures are also produced: such as so-called beauties and talents. Opening any ancient book, one can always find records of their deeds.</p>
<p>Naturally, under the solid walls of feudalism and etiquette in the past, there were also special figures such as so-called filial sons and obedient grandsons, and even more common were women who valued their chastity like jade, earning them memorial arches for their virtuousness!</p>
<p>However, the era has changed now. It is no longer an era of producing loyal ministers, filial sons, or chaste and heroic women. What remains for us today that leaves a lasting impression are only the talents and beauties. However, these talents and beauties are not like the polite and dignified figures of the past, or the suave and elegant ones, who were called talents and beauties. Nor are they like those who spent their years deep in their boudoirs, cultivating fair skin, writing poems, making embroidery, and playing the zither, before they could be worthy of such praise. Today's talents must have the heroic essence attached to their literary air, and they must have expertise: such as poets, novelists, artists... only then can they be worthy of being different and becoming a successful talent in society. Otherwise, among the masses, the reputation of a talent cannot be appropriated by you. The same goes for beauties. Moreover, today's beauties must not be weak and reclusive, or be able to write poetry and calligraphy. They must be capable of fulfilling their duties happily. Like men, they should go out and participate in activities. In vast groups and among the masses, they must seize a worthy and praiseworthy reputation, such as social butterflies, empresses, and so on. Otherwise, the reputation of a beauty will not come to your head, and you will forever be just an insignificant figure!</p>
<p>Therefore, today's talents and beauties no longer hold the same prestigious position in society as in the past, and the ways to achieve it are greatly different.</p>
<p>We can now cite two men and women who are most prominent at present, and it is okay to praise them as talents and beauties!</p>
<p>One is the young aviator Sun Tonggang, who returned to the country from Germany a few months ago. When he was studying in Germany, of course, no one knew him. But once he rose up, as the saying goes, "If he doesn't fly, he's fine; but once he flies, he'll amaze the world." In less than two months, he became famous throughout the country. Although he has his own special skills, it is not inappropriate for us to praise him as a talent of the times.</p>
<p>The other is Miss Yang Xiuqiong, the so-called "mermaid," who is now making a big splash. After the National Games, she revealed her reputation, and then won the victory in the Far East Games, and was praised as "Miss China." Within a few months, she rose rapidly, and today, she has almost the magical power to captivate the masses. Almost everyone in the entire society is crazy about her. A certain committee member is willing to lower himself to hold her whip, and other celebrities and wealthy merchants cannot help but bow down before her pomegranate skirt. Some young men and women simply drool with deep envy! [Statement: This is not the author insulting Ms. Yang or making any jokes. The enthusiastic welcome of Ms. Yang in various places in recent days can prove it!] Therefore, with her fame throughout the country and great success, Ms. Yang is of course more than worthy of receiving the praise of a beauty; she should be the beauty among beauties.</p>
<p>We admire talents and beauties of the Sun Tonggang and Yang Xiuqiong type, and we do not want to see talents and beauties like those of the past who only played with words and painted their faces. However, while we hope, we deeply hope that successful talents and beauties do not use their success solely as a tool for showing off, or only become ornaments of society, like the talents and beauties of the past. We hope that all talents and beauties can make genuine contributions to the country and practical rewards to society with their knowledge and skills, instead of merely receiving beautiful names and becoming playthings and entertainment for the general public!</p>
<h3>Philosophy of Man</h3>
<p>— Xi Zhen</p>
<p>I always felt that the phrase "One dollar per ticket, everyone can get one" in the aviation lottery advertisements was a bit logically flawed. The phrase "everyone can get one" is untenable, because "people who can't come up with a dollar can't get one." I often thought that.</p>
<p>However, one day while walking on the street, I saw a crowd gathered in front of a small restaurant. I squeezed in to see what was happening: the large owner was twisting a young man's arm, demanding money, saying that he owed more than a dollar in total, and hadn't paid for more than a month. "If you can't even come up with a dollar, can you still be considered a person? I'd rather not have it, leave that coat behind, and get out!" Then there was a slap in the face.</p>
<p>"Can someone who can't even come up with a dollar still be considered a person?" The philosopher contemplated that sentence, thinking about the phrase "One dollar per ticket, everyone can get one," and then jumped up with joy as if a mathematician had solved a difficult problem. I understand, I understand! I suddenly understood it all!</p>
<p>"People who can't come up with a dollar were originally not considered people at all, so isn't this 'everyone can get one' absolutely true?"</p>
<p>Contemplating these eight words, they are a clear snapshot of current society. I memorized them as literary and philosophical treasures. You can't find such phrases in Plato's dialogues.</p>
<p>For example, if humans are different from other animals (that is, beasts), then in the current social environment, it is because humans have money, while other animals do not. Even the stubborn gorilla king Kong in the movies knows how to love women, but it doesn't know how to love Yuan Shikai. This point shows the excellence of humans in the animal kingdom. Thus, as the aviation lottery advertisements implicitly state, and the scene in front of the small restaurant shows, just one dollar serves as the dividing line between humans and other animals: "If you have a dollar, you are a person; if you don't have a dollar, you can't be considered a person."</p>
<p>I remembered that Lao Ciji had once answered the question, "Why are humans different from other animals?" In his answer, he attempted to explain the difference between humans and other animals in terms of labor methods. His conclusion was: humans can create and use production machinery; other animals (even apes and gorillas) cannot. If we must use Lao Ciji's words to explain the small restaurant owner's opinion, it is not absolutely impossible: isn't "money" the modern production machinery? Those who have gone hungry can understand this intuitively without much thought.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, if humans really use "money" as the dividing line between themselves and other animals, it is not a clever thing to do. If that's the case, what can humans still be proud of in the animal kingdom? Once other animals acquire the ability to "manufacture production machinery," wouldn't they also be able to become like humans? Let's use an example to illustrate this: "In modern times, people without money live inhuman lives." This statement probably won't be denied, right? But if we think about the deceased dog star Rin Tin Tin, it can use its own services to exchange for money just like humans. It can create "production machinery" and give it to people; thus, it lives a comfortable life as a wealthy person, enjoying the superior status of the "upper class."</p>
<p>We often hear people say: "The world is really messed up now. People with money are people; people without money are animals." Turning it around, we see: "People without money are animals, and animals with money are also people."</p>
<p>Previously, we said that "money" was only the dividing line between humans and other animals, but now "money" has further become the "admission ticket" to humanity. "Human area, no admittance to idlers": but those with admission tickets are not subject to this rule.</p>
<p>I would like to think that this is a myth, an absurd legend; but the facts are clearly placed before us, and we cannot deny them. I once saw a philosopher write a sentence in his book: "Humans are not a clever animal." At least, when it comes to the craze for "money," we cannot help but believe it.</p>
<p>But because everyone needs to have money to eat, even I have to become a "not very clever animal." However, I have since lost the pride of being human. That's right: "Humans are not a clever animal."</p>
<p>In a "not very clever" state, let us work hard to obtain the "admission ticket to humanity" forever.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<h3>Four Disagreement Principles of Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>— A Feng</p>
<p>After the Guangdong provincial authorities strictly prohibited men and women from traveling together, the Guangdong Political Research Association further passed five items regarding gender boundaries: (1) prohibiting men and women from riding in the same vehicle, (2) prohibiting men and women from eating together, (3) prohibiting men and women from living together, (4) prohibiting military personnel from walking with civilians, (5) cinemas are prohibited from screening films co-starring men and women. Among the above five items, except for the fourth item, which is an exception regarding "togetherness," most are prohibitions on joint behaviors between men and women. Roughly speaking, they prohibit men and women from swimming together, walking together, eating together, and living together, which can be called the Four Disagreement Principles.</p>
<p>Gambling is open in Guangdong Province, and smoking is open. The authorities fully allow people their freedom and do not prohibit them, but they are particularly strict about the relationship between men and women, perhaps even more so than the rules of the Duke of Zhou. What does this mean? It is truly prohibiting what should not be prohibited, and not prohibiting what should be prohibited. Such a "reversal" policy is laughable. I have playfully composed two bamboo branch poems and recorded them below:</p>
<p>First Poem</p>
<p>The great defense between men and women is decreed, swimming, walking, living, and eating cannot be done together.</p>
<p>There are other paradises for roaming and reveling, all in the opium dens and gambling dens.</p>
<p>Second Poem</p>
<p>Heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies weigh down, smoking and gambling are taxed especially fiercely.</p>
<p>The most disastrous place for young people, mandarin ducks are split and do not meet!</p>
<h3>Suzhou's Little Confusion</h3>
<p>I have been to Suzhou, visited Xuanmiao Temple, and heard Little Confusion chatter nonsensically, which was very interesting. He said that people are born wrong; eyebrows should grow on fingers, which can be used as toothbrushes; the nose should be turned upside down so that a Parker or Conklin fountain pen can be inserted; one eye should grow in the front and one in the back so that one can take care of both front and back; and the anus should grow on the top of the head so that an umbrella can be inserted on rainy days. This kind of talk is truly imaginative, and the audience opened their mouths and laughed at him.</p>
<p>As a result, he sold hundreds of pieces of herbal pear syrup candy. Alas!</p>
<h3>One Day</h3>
<p>— Meng Jun</p>
<p>Waking up in the morning, the pale yellow sunlight was already shining obliquely on the head of the bed, dazzling my eyes. Even if I wanted to turn over and take another nap, I was afraid I couldn't sleep soundly anymore. I got up, took some cold water from the lead kettle, rinsed my mouth, and washed my face. I looked at the clock; it was already half past seven.</p>
<p>At this time, my mother also got up. She asked me what I wanted to eat? Should she ask A Jin to buy it? Every morning my mother asks me this, but I always just quickly make some cold rice with boiling water because of the time constraints, and consider it a breakfast. To me, this is nothing, but my mother always stares at me, as if to say, "Is it too bland?"</p>
<p>After I got dressed, I looked back at the clock just before leaving. Another fifteen minutes had passed unceremoniously; it was a quarter to eight. Walking out the door, I calculated in my mind that if there were no delays on the road, I could still make it to the factory before half past eight. Although being ten minutes or fifteen minutes late wouldn't really matter, why should I have to see their faces? I walked to the tram stop, and luckily the tram arrived.</p>
<p>After getting off the tram, I transferred to a public bus. I saw the big clock opposite the Great World pointing to eight o'clock. When getting on the public bus at this time, I always saw some familiar faces that I encountered every day. Everyone mechanically sat down, smoked, or looked out the window.</p>
<p>The so-called "going to the office" happens at this time.</p>
<p>The bus arrived at Sichuan Road, and a group of people got off. The Bund, another group got off. Nanjing Road, Beijing Road, groups of people got off. After passing Beijing Road, there were only a few people left on the bus. "Those who eat foreign company meals," Shanghai has a unique abundance of this kind of talent! A sentence I will never forget floated into my mind again: "In Shanghai, it is not easy to recruit a hundred dogs, but to recruit a hundred Chinese who can speak English can be done immediately."</p>
<p>The education in a semi-colonial country is remarkably successful, which cannot help but make me sad.</p>
<p>The bus arrived at its destination at only five minutes before eight thirty. I got off the bus, walked into the factory building, and the clattering of the machines came to my ears. Everything at the factory was as usual. I stepped into the door, and the gatekeeper always said, "Mr. X, good morning," sometimes adding, "Hot today, isn't it?" My response was just a nod or a "hm."</p>
<p>The desk was piled with nothing but letters and bills. Two or three foremen were waiting at the office window for the key to get materials. Dealing with this and busying with that occupied the whole morning, without even five minutes to spare for a quick smoke.</p>
<p>Time always flies faster when people are busy with this and that. The three and a half hours of the morning passed in an instant. Then, whoosh! The whistle blew, it was lunchtime. The factory does not provide lunch, so I had to go to a restaurant to eat. I often had a bowl of mixed soup and two bowls of white rice, which was considered the second meal of the day. This bowl of mixed soup truly lived up to its name, with greens, vermicelli, meat skin, tofu skin, edamame, and some other things I couldn't name all mixed together in a big bowl. A first-class meal cost no more than 360 to 500 wen in total.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, from one o'clock, it was back to office work until five o'clock. As long as the workers hadn't left, there wouldn't be a moment to spare. Today was even more exceptional. The work assigned for the day was not finished by five o'clock. Writing this, copying that, quietly, except for the gatekeeper, I was the only one left in the factory. If I wanted to complain about my fate, I couldn't really complain so much. Just the fact that workers could record overtime and get extra pay was enough to make me sigh with inferiority.</p>
<p>Leaving the factory, I threw my tired body onto the public bus, and sat down simply not wanting to move anymore. Even if there were one or two brightly dressed women sitting next to or opposite us on the bus, they couldn't raise my drooping eyes.</p>
<p>When the bus arrived at the Great World, I subconsciously raised my eyes and looked at the big clock opposite, which was pointing exactly at seven o'clock.</p>

<h3>Unpaid Rent</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>I really find it a bit difficult to say, and I'm very embarrassed to tell you about this, but circumstances are pressing me, forcing me to seek your advice.</p>
<p>I rented a room on North Sichuan Road, and recently, due to unemployment, I owe three months' rent. Two months ago, the landlord repeatedly urged me to pay, or he would rather sacrifice a month's rent and ask me to move out. Sir, when a person is poor, his ambitions are short-lived. I can barely afford to eat, so where would I get the money to pay rent? Friends and family, seeing how poor I am, are unwilling to let me stay with them. Therefore, I deceived him, saying that money would definitely be sent home next month, and if I didn't pay next month, he could seize my belongings. But to this day, things remain the same, and I have no solution. So, the landlord, on the one hand, drove me to despair</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>and on the other hand, seized all my belongings. Fortunately, a friend, remembering our friendship, allowed me to stay, so I wouldn't be left homeless. But daily necessities must be provided by myself, so I went to the landlord to ask for my washbasin and towel. Unexpectedly, the landlord insisted on not returning them until I paid in full. I said, my bed alone is enough to cover the rent owed. What reason do you have to seize all my belongings? But he wouldn't reason with me, and I have no way to deal with it. May I ask, sir, do I have the right to take back my daily necessities? What method should I use to deal with him? I earnestly seek your guidance. With respectful wishes,</p>
<p>Yours sincerely, Li Yunsheng bowing</p>
<p>Answer: If you fail to pay rent, the landlord not only has the right to retain your belongings but also can obtain compensation or sell the retained items without having to petition the court. The right of retention can be auctioned off according to the method of pledge. However, the things retained also have a considerable range. The retained items only need to be sufficient to pay the rent owed, and the tenant can take back the remaining items. If the value of your bed is enough to cover the rent, then the remaining items can naturally be taken back. If he refuses to reason with you, you can turn to the leasing regulations in the Continued Compilation of Civil Law and show them to him. That way, he will naturally have nothing to say.</p>

<h3>The Simpleton (4)</h3>
<p>— Lin Bin</p>
<p>Hunger turned the simpleton into a long-term worker who ate for free without pay. During the day, his stomach didn't rumble as badly as before, but at night, there was a particularly pungent and offensive odor unique to cowsheds.</p>
<p>Every day, he faced the harsh morning wind and trod on the damp frost, going with the master to the vast fields or climbing the steep firewood mountain, until darkness swallowed the earth. Except for lunchtime, there was no rest at all. And at night, by the light of a soybean-sized kerosene lamp, he husked several pecks of rice alone or accompanied the mistress to grind a peck of wheat, which was also a common occurrence.</p>
<p>In order to stimulate the remaining strength in his large frame, in order to make him completely forget fatigue and rest, the master constantly injected stimulants. The so-called stimulants were nothing more than "So-and-so's daughter is beautiful and talented. As long as you work hard for me, I will definitely arrange for you to marry her," or "I've told you, her father is about to agree." With this kind of empty talk that never materialized, the simpleton constantly and wholeheartedly sold his only possession - his labor.</p>
<p>When he was working in the fields or chopping firewood in the mountains, he always hummed vulgar and lewd mountain songs. The singing was rough and loud, causing the surrounding high mountains and deep valleys to echo powerfully.</p>
<p>When he was tired of singing, his voice gradually became weaker. But he wasn't silent. Replacing the loud singing was a low-pitched soliloquy. He chatted incoherently, sometimes seeming to talk about his hometown, the local bullies, and his own life and wife.</p>
<p>"So beautiful! Dragon and phoenix eyes, receding chin, three-inch feet. So beautiful!" These were the words he always used to describe his wife.</p>
<p>His tangled conversation, the conversation containing endless suffering and sorrow, the fire-like glint of anger in the depths of his eyes, the small, crystal-clear tears floating in the corners of his eyes, and the bitter face containing a strong smile like a razor blade, all showed people a heartbreaking history of a trampled farmer, and the helpless sorrow of wanting to tear up this heartbreaking history but being unable to.</p>
<p>"So where is your wife now?" someone asked.</p>
<p>"Someone else took her."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Zhang Xingshan."</p>
<p>Then he raised his hoarse voice and sang, his singing somewhat trembling:</p>
<p>"Zhang Xingshan, not a human being, seizing another man's wife is a serious crime!"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Three stone and five rent grains."</p>
<p>"You couldn't pay three stone and five rent grains, so they took your wife? These years have been famine years!"</p>

<h3>The Banning of Co-Starring Films for Men and Women Amid the Retro Movement (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Danfeng</p>
<p>For example, if the elegant and charming demeanor of people's concubines were to be put on the silver screen as newsreels, there would have to be disguised grooms and guards shouting and following her, and these grooms and guards would be men. What would happen in this case? Of course, this is malicious propaganda that should be banned. But if a certain film company were to make a film promoting highway construction, which is a great and remarkable work for the Party and the country, then there would inevitably be some ladies or daughters dressed neatly to throw champagne or cut ribbons. At the same time, there would be no shortage of committee comrades giving speeches and helping out, making a lively scene and embellishing the occasion. In this case, there would again be men and women mingling together, which is greatly inconsistent with the ancient customs of the Three Dynasties. What would happen in this case?</p>
<p>The situation with domestic films is like this, but on the other hand, what about foreign films? Everyone knows that foreign films have embraces, kisses, "I love you," and "I want you." The mutual attraction between men and women is quite embarrassing. Compared to Chinese films, they are much more nauseating. Confucius would shake his head upon seeing them, and even Liu Xiahui would inevitably be confused. Their distance from the moral concepts of adults and gentlemen is a clearly obvious fact. So, shouldn't they all be banned? Needless to say, "When the Great Way prevails, all under heaven will work for the common good." According to what the "Bible" shows, of course, we must treat China and foreign countries as one and the same. However, if this is really the case, I'm afraid it won't be easy to do. Because if we do this, wouldn't we be harming the goodwill of friendly nations? Wouldn't we be offending the foreign masters? This is definitely not a fun thing to do.</p>
<p>Let's talk about women. In Japan, before the Meiji Restoration, they were not allowed to eat at the same table as their husbands. When men ate, women knelt beside them to serve them rice until they were finished eating, and then they could eat. This cruel rule may still exist in some rural areas of Japan today. So, if China does the same, is it preparing to be a subjugated nation? Of course, we dare not speculate on the profound wisdom of adults and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Soon, some people predict that in the future, Guangzhou will build a high wall in the middle of the road to separate men and women. According to this example, future Chinese films will definitely only allow men to ride horses and shoot, or only allow women to embrace and dance. When necessary, talk about homosexual love? Otherwise, only "Lone Army Souls" or "Feminine" will be allowed to be screened in China. However, there are too few of these films, and it is indeed not easy to do.</p>
<p>However, we remember that "Qiongdong Storm" or "A Trouble Within the Fold," which were produced under the command of generals, both depicted the shameless behavior of men and women who were attracted to each other. I wonder if they are also on the list of banned films? Otherwise, wouldn't it be a bit painful to get a red face from slapping oneself? (The End)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Little Miss Marker"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Little Miss Marker</p>
<p>丨丨Grand Theater丨丨</p>
<p>Under a kind of conscience and morality, the playwright attempts to use the method of persuading with good words to influence the general unemployed ruffians in his works. This motive makes the film somewhat bear the mission of education. In any case, his intention is commendable.</p>
<p>However, we must move people with truth, that is to say, if it is not 100% true, it will not generate the power to move people. From this point of view, the playwright of "Little Miss Marker" has not done it. He departs from economic conditions and teaches with empty words.</p>
<p>We shouldn't completely believe that those gamblers and the like can sacrifice everything for the sake of a little girl, right? We also wouldn't believe that they could hold a grand masquerade ball to win the girl's heart, right? Things like this really make us believe that it's just the playwright talking.</p>
<p>Regarding this aspect, we completely disagree with the views of soft theorists. They believe that what is expressed in the film does not necessarily have to be something that really exists in the world. Our requirement, however, is to express a truth that is more true than reality from the common and ordinary lives of ordinary people. The shortcoming of "Little Miss Marker" lies here. If the playwright is not too exaggerated in his fantasy, then we believe that it can make people cry with gratitude to depict it in terms of "human love."</p>
<p>Because of the content's decision, the director ultimately has no way to hide the flaws in the script. His strength is only in creating a very bright atmosphere, allowing the plot to progress without any stagnation. This major achievement is due to the child, a natural outpouring of goodness and beauty, like a myth, also like a fable, filling the screen with joyful humor. Although we feel unrealistic exaggeration in a few scenes, in some scenes, that kind of goodness and beauty, overflowing in a static atmosphere, is indeed something that vulgar directors cannot do. These are particularly evident in scenes such as the child telling stories before going to sleep or innocent prayers. From the moment the child is kicked by a horse, the climax of the play is formed until Stevie donates blood. The anxious movements of everyone, as well as Stevie seeing the serious expressions on people's faces from outside the door, and the atmosphere during the surgery, all show that the director has a very good grasp of capturing the audience's sympathy.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the main achievement of this play is that the young actress Shirley Temple has achieved great success. Almost every word and every action of hers, because she is easy to be loved, for most of the time, she is teaching people to laugh with joy. Secondly, Adolphe Menjou should be considered the most successful. Compared to his previous plays, which are known for their suave and unrestrained style, we believe that he has achieved a unique style in this play. The deceased Dorothy Dell also performed well, and the rest were just average.</p>

<p>You can all guess how much longer that hourglass-figured woman, Mae West, can hold out on the screen, but Mae West herself is not worried about herself. She has heard all the speculation and criticism about her from the outside world. Some people say that she has acted in three films in a row, but only the first one was successful. Therefore, she can only act in one or two more films at most, and then she can retire to her hometown. But she is very confident in herself. She says that the reason she was able to become a star as soon as she appeared on the screen is entirely because she is a "mature artist," and not an accidental success. She may hit the bullseye with one shot, or she may fail completely, but once she has hit the bullseye, can't she maintain it? Therefore, she feels that there is no reason for people to say that she will not be able to stand in Hollywood for long. But she has now decided to be very careful about the films she will act in in the future and the number of films she will act in. Of course, Mae West is an exceptionally intelligent woman, and she must have her own wonderful methods to maintain her position.</p>

<h3>Dorothy Dell Has Passed Away</h3>
<p>— Bo'er</p>
<p>"Death always comes in threes. Lilinda Xumen and Liu Jiadai are already two. I wonder who the third one is?" I vaguely remember that not long ago, Dorothy was talking to people in the company. At that time, someone said to her, "Wouldn't that be you?" "Now it has come true. The two things happened only twelve hours apart.</p>
<p>After finishing things in the company, she wanted to rush back to attend a banquet. Unfortunately, on the road, the driver lost control. The car first hit a large rock, and then hit a wooden telephone pole, rolling for about 100 yards before being completely shattered. Dorothy was seriously injured and died on the spot. The driver also died six hours later after being taken to the hospital. He was Dr. Carl Wagner.</p>
<p>Dorothy was a rising star who was recently discovered. She usually joked with people, saying that she would either drown or die in a car accident. Now her prophecy has come true. She was a talented actress. Recently, her reputation was no less than that of Claudette Colbert. The most heartbroken by her death was five-year-old Shirley Temple, because she became very close after collaborating on "Little Miss Marker." Alas! Heaven always refuses to let talented people live long!</p>
<h3>Silver Miscellaneous Talks</h3>
<p>— Bai Pin</p>
<p>Stars often have disputes over listing issues, thinking that their name being listed later is a great humiliation!</p>
<p>In fact, this mentality is the opposite of the audience's mentality. If a certain star occupies a very important position, even taking the lead, then the audience should pay special attention to that star. If the results are good, it is acceptable. Otherwise, paying attention with great hope, but the result is disappointing, so-called "The greater the hope, the greater the disappointment." Then, although a certain star occupies an advantage in the listing, if the results are not good, then although "obtained" it is not enough to compensate for the "loss"!</p>

<h3>Good Son and Good Wife (Born to be Kissed) (13)</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Tom, after hearing his father and Eddie argue, felt that Eddie had not been honest or complete in what she had told him before. So, he angrily said to Eddie, "You're lying to me... About Chris Kins' infidelity... and that man last night, how long have you two been together?" At this point, Eddie could no longer stand it. She cried and screamed, "Get out of here!" Tom, when she screamed, didn't move. So, Eddie screamed again, "Get out of here!" Pan Qi took a step and went out. He turned around and softly shouted to Tom, "Son, let's go." Tom had no choice but to follow his father out. Eddie was left alone, shouting behind Tom, "Tom! Tom! Come back! I don't want you to go!" But he didn't know if Tom heard her, or if he heard her, he ignored her. No understanding. No forgiveness. No sound of footsteps returning. Eddie was alone, her heart filled with sorrow and worry. In this sorrow and worry, she made a decision... She would never talk about love again... She would no longer be a good woman... She must take revenge... Pan Qi must receive due punishment!</p>
<p>Since Tom followed his father out of Jefferson Lai City Prison, he could not quickly forget Eddie. Later, his father persuaded him to go to London with him. Although he agreed without much thought, when the day came when they boarded the ship and were about to set sail, Tom suddenly told his father, "Father, I still need to go ashore once. I forgot something." His father was about to ask him what it was when he ran away, running from the gangplank straight to the shore. He ran to the shore, hailed a taxi, and handed a slip of paper to the driver. The driver took it and looked at it. Written on it were the words "Jefferson Lai City Prison." He looked at Tom with some surprise, and then drove the car away. At the same time, another car came and stopped at the pier. The door opened, and the one who ran out was Chuli, who was there to see them off. He came out and looked back at one of the two women in the carriage. She was dressed luxuriously, wearing an expensive mink coat, but she looked unhappy. Chuli said to the woman, "Eddie, my beautiful, you can wait for me in the car. I'll be down in a moment." She looked at the other woman and said, "Jidi, you accompany her." He patted Eddie's thigh, as if Eddie was already his person, and said, "From here, I'm going to take you home."</p>
<p>Eddie silently watched him walk away, not saying a word, as if she had a plan in mind. She... would go home with him... What else mattered now? Suddenly, she felt a flash before her eyes. She saw the person who had taken photos of her and the unknown man in her room that night. She suddenly jumped out of the car. She chased after him and grabbed his arm. She whispered to him eagerly. The person smiled. She went on the ship with him from the gangplank. At this time, Pan was talking with ordinary people, as well as many reporters, and friends who had come to say goodbye to him. The photographer walked in front of him and said, "Mr. Pan Qi, let me take a picture of you, okay!" Pan Qi nodded happily. The photographer also said, "Please stand a little to the left." Pan Qi also agreed! He stood in the place he pointed to, which was right in front of the door of his private room. Then the photographer shouted loudly, "Okay, Mr. Pan Qi!" He didn't seem to need to shout so loudly. No sooner said than done, when he shouted, the door of Pan Qi's bedroom opened! A person jumped out from inside! (To be continued)</p>
