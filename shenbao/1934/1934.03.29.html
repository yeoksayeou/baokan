<h3 id="c19">美民主黨放棄菲島之因果　恒 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>近今國際事件之最足令世人注意者有二。（一）爲美日之換文。（二）爲美國准許菲島獨立。良以美國此二行動。影響太平洋之形勢甚鉅。唯前一問題。本報已多評議。可暫勿論爰就後一問題。爲之一陳因果。夫以美之放棄菲島。事實上與我國似無關係。同時亦非絕無廻旋餘地。吾人可不必加以甚大之措意。然欲熟察國際情勢。蹈間抵隙因勢利導。隨而謀我領土主權之確保。則在吾人亦有不可忽視者也。</p>
<p>菲島獨立問題之在美國懸而未决至今已三十餘年。方其由西班牙之手。轉入美國版圖之時。美之二大政黨。意見卽已分歧。在共和黨視之。以爲菲島若入美國掌握。則可使之免除西班牙之虐政。及爲其他强國所得實則其意蓋欲强固美國在遠東之地位。圖遏當日列强覬覦中國之機。海約翰之門戶開放機會均等宣言。卽成於美共和黨政府獲取菲島之後。至於民主黨之政策。則異於是。故美海軍攻取菲島之時。民主黨不特不以爲榮。且斥爲「帝國主義之行爲」。迨菲島正式割取。民主黨卽主張使之獨立。其意以爲美之攻取菲島。旣在出菲人於水火。自不容據爲己有。蓋不如是則以暴易暴。殊與初旨相違。當時民主黨所以如此慷慨者。自有深故。其可略爲一言者。卽美自南北戰後。政權常在共和黨之手。其時美國産業日益發達。亟須向外發展。共和黨旣常在朝。代表大工業家之利益。力謀東方勢力之伸展。太平洋島嶼之略取。悉爲此一期間之成績。然於内政。則殊不注意。對於民主黨之復興。亦多方阻撓。民主黨旣受摧殘於南北戰時。又受壓迫於南北戰後。在野之時久。失意之事多。兩相凑合。遂使其政策。偏重於内政之改善。而忽略於對外勢力之擴充。且謂政府黨對外之戰勝攻取愈多。則其對内之壓迫亦愈甚。結果所至。遂以形成民主黨三十年來放棄菲島之一貫政策。</p>
<p>論者常謂外交之道。轉變無方。而唯利是視此說也。要亦爲皮相之論。試就美國放棄菲島而論。其原因亦復多多。簡單言之。黨的傳統政策一也。經濟的原因二也。人種的原因三也。深恐引起日美之戰四也。試分别言之。</p>
<p>美國許予菲島獨立。我人所以視爲民主黨之行動者。理至顯然。一則民主黨自始至終。向來反對菲島之割取。二則每逢民主黨總統當選或國會議席增加之時。每有菲島獨立案提出。如近三十年間。美民主黨當政之時期有二。一爲威爾遜時代。二爲近頃之羅斯福時代。而菲島獨立案之得以通過無阻者。亦唯此二時期。於此時期以外。雖有提案。亦難通過。總計此二時期之中。美國會通過之菲島獨立案有三。（一）爲一九一六年之瓊斯菲島獨立案。許菲島一有鞏固政府。卽予獨立。當經威爾遜批准。一九二○年威爾遜退職時。對國會臨别贈言。認菲島獨立時機已告成熟。勸令立卽履行諾言。（二）爲一九三二年底之哈偉士提案。其時民主黨因一九三○年之改選。在參衆二院已佔多數。故能順利通過。其時民主黨雖因總統競選大勝。然胡佛總統尙在任。故爲胡佛否决。特國會已入民主黨手。總統已無能爲。因是此案終成法律。（三）因菲國會反對哈偉士案。羅斯福復請兩院重議。遂成今日之泰定士法案。此案之所以能順利通過。當爲民主黨之力量。我人試一觀今日美國會之政黨分野。卽可無庸致疑。蓋衆院四三五席中。民主黨實佔三一三席。共和黨僅佔一一七席。參院九六席中。民主黨實佔六零席。共和黨僅佔三五席。民主黨於國會中佔偌大之多數。一切作爲。自能放手做去。故今日美國之許予菲島獨立。實爲美民主黨實施其傳統政策之表現。不能視爲特意規避遠東糾紛之行動。</p>
<p>然此一事。亦非僅一黨之傳統政策所促成。而猶有經濟的人種的以及其他之原因在。蓋菲島一日不獨立。則其蔗糖等之輸入美境者。必無法徵收入口稅。隨而影響其自國製糖業者之營業。同時菲島一日不獨立。則菲人之入美境者。必不能如其他亞洲人之。施以限制。亦可影響美國勞工之生活。且菲島云檀香山可三千海里。去舊金山五千餘海里。突出過甚。爲國防上一大弱點。故論者常謂美國之有菲島。非獨不足以增强美國在遠東之地位。適足以表露其戰略上之缺陷。假使日本對美挑釁而攻此弱點。則今日之美。雖欲與日本不戰。亦不可得。加之菲律賓島海岸之長。有一萬一千餘英哩。砲壘軍港防禦工程之建築。耗費至堪驚人。一九二二年華认會議。美國所以對日讓步。停止菲島防禦工程之增築。卽因糜費過鉅故也。以美國今日經濟之衰落。自以放棄菲島爲得策。故美國今次對於菲島之行動。亦可視爲戰略上之預先退却。更可視爲不欲與日作戰之表示。</p>
<p>以上所言。皆爲美國放棄菲島之原因。除此最後一種外。可謂與遠東事件中日問題無甚關係。然其影響所及。實不能謂爲絕無關係也。第一美國此一行動。多少可以减低其在遠東之威望。而增强日本爲所欲爲之驕燄。然謂日本從此更無牽掣。要亦過言。一則十二年之期限。美國儘有廻旋之餘地。二則下屆太平洋會議。美俄法荷等國。未必不爲美國聲援。以確保菲島之中立。或竟進而限制日本在遠東之行動。亦未可知。三則太平洋會議失敗。美國仍有充分之餘暇。以爲對日制裁之凖備。四則美衆院二年一改選。參院二年改選三分一。總統四年一改選。故共和黨儘有十二年内重握政權之機會。故菲島之能否於十二年内獨立。及美國陸海軍之能否於規定期間。全數撤退。皆爲不可知之問題。故今日美國放棄菲島之表示。國人庸爲之過慮。所要者於下屆太平洋會議中。吾人應有極審愼周密之預備耳。</p>

<p>軍縮主幹會將展緩召集</p>
<p>（倫敦）　内閣軍縮問題委員會昨日開會研究三月十七日法國政府關於軍縮問題之復文時、以爲法國政府之意、似將保障辦法分爲兩種、一爲未來軍、縮公約實施上之保障、一爲關於安全之一般保障、已誌昨電、本日法國駐英大使戈爾平又與外相西門口頭說明三月十七日法國復文中所稱之軍縮公約實施上保障、究應作何解釋、隨後仍將交換意見、英國要人方面對於此事、雖不作過分之樂觀、但認爲實有可以滿意之理由、無論如何、外相西門明日將以其所得到之消息、報告内閣會議、大約渠將立卽與軍縮會議、主席漢德森會晤、而四月十日原定開會、之主席團少數委員會、亦有暫緩召集之可能、在内閣會議未開會以前、有勢力方面之意見分爲兩派、一派主張由英法、兩國商議軍縮公約實施上之保障辦法、另一派則對軍縮會議同喪失信用、宣言以後、當足踏實地、迅卽充實國防、目下第一派仍占優勝、但如現在之努力仍歸失敗、則第二派意見必轉占上風、所謂現在之努力、似趨向於局部恊定之訂立、一如昨日本社所報告者、卽軍縮公約實施上之保障、如不能求其在全世界發生效力、卽當僅就英國及其最近之鄰國成立恊定、而對於此範圍以外之各國、則採取較少强、制性之辦法、目下趨勢所以如是者、美國態度與有力焉、蓋美國總統於批評法國、所致英國之軍縮復牒時、曾謂如討論國際問題而締結諮商公約、美國自願與其事、但如强其運用武力以解决任何國際糾紛、則美國未能承認云、吾人於各派意見紛歧之中、發見一種思想、卽英國人咸以爲現在問題、爲英國本身安全之所繫是也、英國人士目下對德國航空部長戈林所率領之空軍、與歐戰前德國海軍、上將狄爾比兹所指揮之裝甲艦同等看待、故英國人目下之希望、乃在以最廉之代價、保障國家安全、而避免一切危險、明乎此、而後英國對於軍縮問題之意見、目下旣有轉變之可能、又有轉變之困難者、吾人不難得知所以矣、（二十七日哈瓦斯社）</p>

<p>（一）如在兩國發生爭端時、法國將以執行式之擔保抑以普通之擔保、此乃兩種不同性質之事實也、據大使古平氏稱、法國已承認執行擔保與普通擔保理論上之不同、然事實上則不作此想、此因條約一旦被破壞、勢必牽涉及於武力也、此時則顯示吾人條約國批准執行擔保與普通擔保之重要性云、</p>
<p>（二）如法國已確定執行擔保與普通擔保之不同性、則在兩種不同之時勢下、法國所欲者究爲何種擔保乎、據大使古平氏稱、法國對於此點之答覆、詞極圓滑、並反問英國願意供獻何種擔保、</p>
<p>（三）法國所欲者、究爲疆土擔保制度、抑普通擔保制度、</p>
<p>據大使古平氏稱、法國同意者爲疆土擔保之恊定、法或並的詰英國願建議何種範圍之恊定也云云、（二十八日國民電）</p>

<p>（四）國民經濟（註十二）</p>
<p>（一）富法者、社會生活之反應也、立憲精神、當隨時代而演進、當因社會生活之變化而革新、以前人民、在君主貴族壓迫之下、故政治自由、爲解放人民唯一的良劑、亦爲制憲時最重要可貴之原則、今之社會、已改舊觀、人民受資本勢力壓迫之痛苦、遠勝於昔日政治的壓迫、故經濟解放、尤爲現代人民迫切之要求、故現代立憲之目的、不僅在謀政治權之保障、而應兼重經濟權之保障、不在單純保障人民之自由權、而尤應科人民以必要的社會的義務、惟法律并非主觀的具文、其施行之要件、爲客觀的事實、徒法不足以自行、畫餅不足以充飢、此民國以來、中國憲政失敗之主因、亦今後關心法治者所應切實研究之事實問題也、歐戰以後、世界憲法、雖丕然一變、均有社會主義的精神、「然而此種運動、初亦不過盲從、鮮能平心靜氣考慮者、故最後結果、政權仍屬諸穩健派、此穩健性之勝利、實戰後革命運動以及各國新憲中之大事實也、」（註十三）故戰後如南斯拉夫·羅馬尼亞·愛沙尼亞·立陶宛·波蘭諸國、初雖極度左傾、然因受德國革命之影響、均翻然改悟、卽剛愎自用之蘇俄、卒因受實際政治之經騐、以及客觀條件之支配、亦改絃易轍矣、</p>
<p>中國多難、人民方深遭天災人禍之摧殘、外患内亂之壓迫、而産業凋敝、生産技術幼稚、致一般人民、尚不能維持其最低限度的生活的水凖、而爲飢寒所困、輾轉溝壑者、尤無可勝計、故今日中國當務之急、首應共謀生聚、以圖民族資本之發展、魯莽滅裂、固爲社會經濟的條件所不容、卽欲完全摹擬中庸主義的德國憲法、亦間有爲客觀事實所不許、蓋憲法非社撰的、乃生長的、憲法的條文、須立足於社會基礎之上、庶有其實施之可能性、故今日憲法之起草者、抑或批評者、均應有脚踏實地、實事求是之精神、否則、皇皇憲文、非特無益、且將與社會基礎、經濟狀况、互相杆格、背道而馳也、</p>
<p>基此原理、吾人對於憲草第三章、雖於理論上、未能盡如人意、然於實際上、則殊未敢過事高調、徒作情感的批判、歷來政治之所以意見龐雜、而實效不著、亦正坐此弊也、蓋政府誠能如憲文之規定、一一求其實施、則已難能可貴矣、况吾國産業幼稚、則個人企業、誠能求其無害於國家民族的利益、實亦有鼓勵其發展之必要、初未可因憧憬於極端社會主義之境界、而概加抹煞也、（註十四）</p>
<p>吾人所認爲不滿者、約略有二點、（一）發展民族資本、至爲重要、而憲文於此則未有一字規定、似引以爲憾、德憲第一五六條、可供參考、然不必完全抄襲、（二）憲法草第卅一條、主張勞資恊調、原則上無可批評、且極合國情惟此項原則、究應如何實施、遍觀全部憲文、並無綫索可尋、實等徒託空言、於此、德憲第五章第一六五條、可供參考、同時、意大利之政治制度、與恊團制度、亦可供借鑑、（註十五）　（未完）</p>

<p>兩路管理局長黃伯樵·鑒於錢塘江鐵橋興建在卽、爲完成滬杭甬鐵路計、對於已停頓之工程、卽自西興至曹娥江一段鐵路、繼續進行、計自曹娥江至紹興三十一公里、由紹興至西興四十七公里、估計建築費五百六十餘萬元、今路綫等早已劃定、决先收買曹娥江至西興一段民地、然後再動工興建、</p>
<h3 id="c146">完成以後 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>紹興區域人口密度、與寗波段相同、貨運方面、生産品有菜油·錫箔·紹興酒·鮮果·穀繭·棉花·棉紗·糖蔗·石灰·粗紙·南北食品·鹹魚·烟葉等、查寗波段貨運、全年約十三萬噸、其中百分之三十往來紹興、百分之四十往來西興、轉運至諸曁蘭溪等處、以上貨運、平均按三等運價計算、全年約可得二十五萬餘元、連同客運、至少在六十萬元以上、將來完成以後、路局收入、必可增加、</p>
<h3 id="c147">國際貿易局辦理贛茶換波蘭物品 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>何炳賢正與波使館接洽</p>
<p>實業界表示前途多困難</p>
<p>國聞社云、本埠國際貿易局、前奉實業部令、以贛省武寗産茶甚富、爲設法向外傾銷計、以寗茶一百萬元、向蘇俄互換同値煤油、免雙方有過乘之感、於是該局長何炳賢、卽負責向俄方接洽、惟近傳贛茶互換俄油之事、已不可能、而另有向波蘭互换同値物品之議、於是記者於昨日午後、向國際貿易局長何炳賢氏及實業界方面、叩詢詳情、所得消息如下、</p>
<h3 id="c148">向俄換油未成 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>記者首據何氏談、前本局奉實業部令、辦理寗茶向蘇俄互換油類、當時本人卽向蘇俄在華經營油類之油遍地公司接洽、詎雙方磋商之後、蘇俄銷華之汽油煤、以賬務上關係、須現錢購買、而華茶之運俄、須一年後方能付欵、因此問題、華茶本在衰落之中、而此一百萬元之贛茶、又無一集中收購之機關、今小本經營之種戶、須一年後得到代價、則共金融當然週轉不靈、無以爲繼、因此遂告中止進行、</p>
<h3 id="c149">波蘭允換物品 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>至於向波蘭掉換物品、確有此事、惟目下尚在研究中、此事經過、因日前波蘭公使由平南下過京時、曾向陳部長提及此事、渠稱、中國有贛省寗茶四百萬、爲增進中波貿易起見、儘可售予波蘭、但其得價四百萬元、必需在波蘭購置物品運華、故此事、本人正與波使館參贊在考慮進行、諒不久卽可决定、</p>
<h3 id="c150">實界表示困難 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>嗣記者復向實業界方面探詢中波互換物品之可能與否、得悉、波蘭物品掉換華茶、困難殊多、因波蘭物品之銷華、查照歷年海關輸出入表、爲數頗微、而由華輸波之物、其數更尠、所有運華波蘭貨、大宗爲棉織品絲織品、而由華輸波、則爲蝦乾·猪腸·紅茶·花生·製網·及未硝之皮類等、雖一九二八年由波輸華總數達二百五十八萬七千餘元、但其間二百五十萬元、盡屬軍火、故依照此統計數字、實不可能、卽能互換、其間華方所欲換需要物品、不論價値如何、亦正須一番縝密研究也云、</p>

<h3 id="c159">有綫無綫電報兩機關合併可實現 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>電信界咸表贊同正研究實施</p>
<p>郵電支局合設一處尙無成議</p>
<p>交通部爲革新電政、計劃合併有綫無綫電局台、令知各局台研究並貢獻意見、昨日記者分訪本市電政負責人、詢以對此意見、據答、有綫無綫、同爲國家營業機關、對合併原則、自極贊同、并談近年來有綫電改進情形、及本市郵政支局與電報收發處合併情形、兹分誌如下、</p>
<p>綫路整理　有綫電報自前清創設以來、已閱數十年、雖綫路有三年一小修、五年一大修之規定、但因政治未上軌道、徒有虛名、而辦理電政者、亦視同衙門、致窳敗不堪、且時多滯誤、將務不振、自國民政府奠都南京後、年來交通部積極整頓、去年度修整之電綫、計幹綫三千七百三十二公里、支線一千六百三十九公里、共五千三百七十一公里、水綫尙不計在内、本年仍繼續修理、以冀報務暢達、</p>
<p>合作便利　無綫電臺設立後、有綫電報在業務上始有競爭、於收發報務、力求迅速、並革去官僚衙門之陋習、使人民之使用電信、感到便利、蓋國家事業、爲全國人民所公有、非主辦者之私産、固應力求便利人民也、有綫無綫電報、各有所長、無可偏廢、在歐美各國無綫電事業已甚發達、而有綫電仍依然存在、現在本市有綫電無線電之收發處、已有一二處合設一處者、業務上固相合作、將來交通大厦落成後、本市各交通部所屬各機關、如招商局·航空公司·國際電信局·等均擬集中一處辦公、對有無綫電報局之合併、自屬不成問題也、</p>
<p>郵電併設　交通部前令三等以下各局郵電併設、本市爲試辦區域、電郵兩當局迭次商擬、以本市郵政支局達十九處、較僻各處、固無庸分設收發處、免徒增開支、至繁盛各處、均擬增設收發處、但復須顧及現在郵支局内有無餘屋、可資合用、故尚未能實現、近日電報局先在西門上海銀行支行内、添設一收發處、於四月一日開始辦公、</p>

<p>丨答王祖明君丨</p>
<p>大許多讀者送來的讀書計劃裏，我們看見有「書法」一項，很佔有一時間，我們又在讀者給我們的來信的首尾上，讀到了讀者如何自謙他的「書法」的不佳，一再請求我們的原恕。其實，這些信偏偏又都是寫得很清秀，甚至連編者苦心的來寫也還寫不出來的。這確可看出讀者如何的注重書法，他是誠心要學習的，把它列入重要的科目，竟佔去自學的一半時間？譬如就王祖明君說，他是一個店員，每日餘暇的時間僅祗二小時，他的自學課程就是一小時讀書，一小時寫字。因爲他練的是大字，所以在「寫」以前還要磨墨，但是王君無此時間，他惟一辦法，就是利用了讀書那小時小，一面讀書，一面磨墨，這一來，明明白白專注的方向是在「寫」那「麻姑壇」上，讀書的效率自然不免减小了。</p>
<p>我們並不奇怪這種現象，我們也不反對每人都能寫一筆挺秀的字。我們知道造成這種風氣的是另有原因在，是不能盲目的與以贊成或反對的。</p>
<p>不過，在寫字上消耗許多的時間，總是一件很可惜的事，也是業餘自學上一件最不經濟的打算，旣然諸君在不知不覺中向我們提出了這一問題，我們自然不能默不一言，不能不把它當作一項嚴重問題，提出在大家之前。</p>
<p>「寫字」在中國人的眼裏素來佔很重要的地位，這一方面是統治者對於文人一種很巧妙的消靡你的精力的軟計，使你在這種小技中忘記更重大的「國家大事」，猶如女子裹足，使她失掉反抗力。一方面是中国或文字不脫象形之故，書法成爲了一種美術，變爲士大夫個人享樂，「養性」的寄托。它在過確可以說，在封建藝術中，佔有了相當的地位。</p>
<p>二十年來，書法的地位漸漸的没落了。這是自然的趨勢。雖然，在今日的小學裏寫字猶列爲一學科，其目的明明與以前兩様了。我們再没有閑工夫法消耗在這種「藝術」裏，因爲我們要知道的東西實在是太多了，比寫字要重要得多了。</p>
<p>但是，雖然如此，社會上仍不免留有對這一「藝術」的迷戀，這是一種守舊的心理；尤其是在「官廳」，商界這類地方，對於低級職員的抄寫仍很講究，仍維持了重視書法的觀念，造成了我們許多讀者讀書計劃中一書重項目的基礎。至於，新式的大公司，他們一天天改用了打字機，就是職員日用上也改用了鉛筆，對於書法却不大講究了。</p>
<p>中國書法，必然的要隨着社會生活日益複雜而變爲一種不重要的技術，祇要清白，易於認識，運用敏捷就十分够了。眞正以它爲藝術而享樂的人，大概也祇有鄭孝胥那輩人罷了？　　上面說了這許多閑話，但是，對於諸君不是完全没有用處的，諸君在觀念上，不免有認識不清之處，現在尚爲了這種不必多費精力的課程在白用時間，我們雖然要提出抗議，但是如果不從觀念方面解放諸君，諒來也不會說服諸君的罷！</p>
<p>爲了諸君工作上的需要，諸君可以讀書筆記，往來信件及店務中去順便練習寫字，實在犯不着把二分之一的時間去專門練字呀！依據我們的經騐，現在商店中也用不着再寫「麻姑壇」的字，有了熟練技能也儘够了。</p>
<p>此「書法」更重要，與諸君生活更相聯繫的知識，前面已經說過，眞是多而又多，在商言商，今日市塲上的現象諸君都能了解嗎？諸君的能力都能應付裕如嗎？這些方面可是僅寫得一筆好字的人可能對付呢？</p>
<p>最後，我們希望將寫字列爲重要科目的讀者諸君，從速改變自己的觀念，把讀書計劃作一點修改，减少寫字時間，把你更需要的學科加入進去，不要白費你的光隂了。</p>
<p>以外，凡是關於「書法」見詢的諸君，譬如提出：「我學顔字好呢？還是學柳字？」或者「臨碑呢？還是『描帖』？」及「如何增加書法學習的效力？」等等問題，編者以後概不作答，因爲編者認爲這並不是大家需要的知識，而編者個人對於這方面的知識，確是不及鄭孝胥輩，不能僅自己不願談，也不敢談也。</p>
<p>春秋</p>
<h3 id="c198">我有幾句話要說（上） <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>現在這年頭兒，甚麽都要轉變了。有的轉向右；有的轉向左；有的一轉而直上青雲；有的一轉而直上青雲；有的一轉而轉而打入地獄。在下編這一紙「春秋」，不想别的，只想轉到多數讀者的眼睛裏，博得多數讀者說一聲好，那我就好像小時節在糖人兒擔上，轉動那個小小的轉輪子，的溜溜地轉到了一個挺大挺好的糖佛頭一様。</p>
<p>「春秋」的轉變，又待怎様的轉變起來呢？但看所佔的地位，不過是一全張的四分之一，只好像一個東南半壁的小朝廷。且還被廣告佔去了一角，彷彿中華民國的地圖上，失去了東四省一般，試問這一些些地位，要排得式様好看，如何辦得到？我苦苦的想了一天，總算畫成了一個圖様，一眼看去，倒像是一座戲院子。中央高端是「春秋」兩字的題頭，好似舞台；兩旁兩大塊特别地位，有如兩座大花樓；其餘大小三排的普通地位，似是官廳正廳，而底下一長排專刊「遊踪所至」「世界珍聞」等様的地位，那是月樓了。「春秋」的式様旣像是戲院子，那麽撰稿的諸君全是超等名角，而一切的作品，都是拿手好戲了。至於在下呢，不過是一個躱在幕後的排戲者，有時上台來漏漏臉，也無非跳跳加官而已。</p>
<p>我們本來的第一篇地位，往往刊登那些社論似的作品，論社會旣没頭没腦，無從說起；論國事又礙手礙脚，多所未便。要是不著邊際的專談空理，怕又免不了晉人清談之誚。據歷史告訴我們，晉之亡，亡於清談，因此大書特書，說是清談誤國。這小小的「春秋」，怎當得起誤國的罪名，所以我打算把這一篇空談的文章從此割愛了。</p>
<p>空談的文章旣不要，那麽要些甚麽呢？喏！就是空談的對面，要有實質的文章，以經濟的文字，記述和描寫一段精彩的事實。請撰稿諸君在下筆之際，將一切陳言，一切廢話，做一番清潔運動，打侵個一乾二凈；每篇務以四百字爲限。請諸君在寫完文章之後，高擡貴手，撥動算盤，將全篇字數算上一算，註明在稿紙之上，千萬不要忘却，其他零金碎玉，在四百字以内的，只要語雋意妙，任是寥寥數十字，也不勝歡迎之至。</p>

<p>— 顔</p>
<p>上海虹口一帶，有幾家日本人開設的毛筆店，凡在上海的日本人，他們所用的毛筆，都到他們自己人開的店裏去購備，决不肯到我國筆店去一作顧客，這是他們的愛國心重，十分可佩，不過據我累代製筆的友人李君說：日本店的筆，並不是他們自己所製，乃是販賣我湖州善連鎭有名之胡筆，實是我們的國貨，而非他們的國貨，這一個秘密，想大家知道了，一定要發笑的。</p>
<p>因此我又想起一件更可笑而又可鄙之事：上海有一位有名書家，你如走到他的作書室裏去看，則壁上掛着的林林數十百枝大大中中小小的筆，每枝管上都刻着日本字様，他說他生平用慣日本筆，如用國貨，幾不能作一字，所以他總赴日本筆店去購或定製，不肯到國人開的筆店裏去一作顧客，試想日本筆店之筆，就是來自我湖州之善連鎭的胡筆，豈不可笑？而他愛用外貨成癖，豈不更可鄙嗎？</p>
<p>末了，我希望大家不要以爲日本人還販賣我國貨，我們也就販賣日本貨；不要以爲日本人尚到日本店去買我之筆，我也就到國人販賣日貨店去買日貨，更希望那位有名的書家，快改掉那可笑可鄙的惡習慣。</p>

<p>端硯概况</p>
<p>（庚）石眼　前人論硯，或以有眼爲貴，或以有眼爲病，都係偏論，大抵佳眼，足以引人審美的興味，劣眼則令人望而厭惡，石嫩潤者眼必鮮活，斯爲佳眼，石枯老者眼必灰黃；則爲劣眼，又以高眼爲佳，低眼爲劣，後人論眼，都如此主張，佳眼之中，尤以圓正明媚，有五色暈多至十數層或八九層，而瞳人鮮活者爲最佳品，眞是萬金難求的，此外有多眼布列於硯，如北斗或如五星心房形者，亦絕難得。石隱硯談論石眼一段，較爲賅括，錄之於下：</p>
<p>下巖石的眼，謂之鸜鵒眼，上巖下穴，謂之鸚哥眼，上巖上中穴，謂之雞翁猫兒眼，（瞳子成直綫形者爲貓眼）半壁上謂之雀兒眼了哥眼，土人以此别之，又云：端有鸜鵒眼，又有鴉眼象眼，黃謂之鴉，碧謂之鸜鵒，眼不貴黃也，圓者爲鸜鵒有鴉，長者爲象眼，眼不貴長也，眼有三種，暈多精瑩，謂之活眼，朦朧昏滯，謂之淚眼。内外焦黃，謂之死眼，（又有人說輪廓竟大者爲怒眼，層暈模糊者爲翳眼。暈中有白點者爲盲眼。都非上品，）端人謂石嫩則眼多，老則眼少，嫩石潤細發墨，所以貴有眼也，</p>
<p>又有赤眼，圓如珊瑚鳥目，翠眼緊小無瞳，均爲下品。</p>
<p>前人又會青脈者必有眼，腰石脚石，多有青脈，又稱青脈爲眼筯，然則青］脈究爲何物呢，吾人細細研侒，凡下巖石青綠的表現，都是青脈的表現，端人稱不成眼様者謂之翡翠紋。日本犬養顔木堂翁的翰墨談，謂眼無瞳而小者爲綠豆眼，綠豆眼之小者爲翡翠紋，翡翠紋之小者爲青花，青花之小者爲微塵鵝氄蟻脚等。可知所謂眼，所謂翡翠紋，所謂各種青花，名雖種種不同，而其實質則爲一類，坂東氏論青花與眼的搆成分子，都爲輝綠巖的集結，（見前論青花）尤足以爲吾解釋青脈的一證也。</p>

<p>阿水生坐在屋子裏，一邊握着旱烟管，猛吸着旱烟，一邊對着坐在他旁邊的老妻說道：「銀寳娘，這只老黃牛病得如此光景，恐怕不會好的了。它年年做着極繁重的工作，究竟老了，明年决也不能再用來耕田。倘然死了。怎麽好？我想不如把它賣去了，多少可以撈回些本錢，並且出月初一我們要付一筆會錢，今年收成雖然不錯，可是多收了不値錢，租米照様要還的。白費了一年血汗，一個錢也没有多，把什麽來付會錢過年呢？所以我决定把這老黃牛賣掉了。」他說着，態度很是堅决。</p>
<p>銀寳娘在旁邊搓繩，聽了伊丈夫的話，便嘆口氣說道：「這只老黃牛本是捨不得賣去的，記得我們以前費了七十多塊錢，纔將它買來。我的一副很粗的金環子也不是拿去向城裏金子店兌了錢凑數的麽？可惜它帮我們做了許多年數，竟老了；不但老了，竟病了！不錯，我們倆也老了不少哩！現在自然祗有依你的話，把它賣去，拿幾個錢回來；可是明年耕田時，我們没得這多年相隨的老黃牛，却如何是好呢？我再没有第二副金環子凑了錢去買别的耕牛來了。」銀寳娘說着話，臉色十分憂鬱，伊手中却不住地仍在搓伊的繩。</p>
<p>阿水生吸了筒烟，向地上敲去了烟灰，指着庭中抱着小狗玩耍的銀寳說道：「娘寳這小丫頭已有十二歳了。橋頭的趙鄉長，見了伊很歡喜，他對我說過的，要銀寳去做他家的養媳婦。他肯先付我六十塊錢的聘金，將來銀寳大了，由他們做主，擇日成婚，仍許我們去吃喜酒。我想趙家是有錢的人家。在鄉間很的勢力，趙鄉長的第三兒子名喚炳生，已有十四歳，在本地洋學堂裏念書，生得很俊的。我家銀寳嫁了他，一交觔斗跌到青雲裏了。祗要我對趙鄉長答應一聲，便可有六十塊錢到手，再好去買一條耕牛來了。我的主意不是很好的麽？」銀寳娘道：「好是好的，但你竟把銀寳和老黃牛一般看待去出賣麽？」阿水生道：我打定主意這様辦了。老黃牛賣出殺的，銀寳却是送給人家去交好運的，你怎様可以將人去比牛呢？」說畢，笑了一笑。</p>
<p>夫婦債决議之後，老黃牛當然出賣了。阿水生吃飽了飯，遂出去接洽賣牛的事。</p>
<p>晚上，銀寳得知了老黃牛要出賣的消息，伊的心裏大大不安起來，向伊母親問道：「老黃牛生了病，怪可憐的，我們爲什麽要把它賣去呢？」</p>
<p>它老了，做不動工作了，不能耕田了，又是患着病，一定不會好的；所以你爹爹要將它賣去，得幾個錢，明年再想法去買新的强的年輕的耕牛來帮助我們到田裏去耕去。」</p>
<p>「老黃牛旣然老了，病了，不能再耕田，那麽人家買了去有有何用呢？」銀寳問着，臉上露出懷疑的神情。</p>
<p>銀寳的母親笑了一笑道：「你不知道老黃牛是賣給人家去殺的，你不看見市上出賣的醬牛肉，都是這些牛的肉啊！」</p>
<p>「啊！這老黃牛是賣去給人家殺却的嗎？」銀寳臉上露出一種悲戚的神色，似信不信的向伊母親詰問。</p>
<p>「自然賣給人家去殺的。它不會耕田，養着何用？你父親也正要用錢呢？」伊母親答。</p>
<p>銀寳聽了，哇的一聲，哭將出來。伊頓足哭着道：「老黃牛是我的好朋友，我每天要牽着它玩的。它向我索食，我把稻草喂它，它認識我了。天熱的時候，父親牽它到田裏去，它没有一天不去工作的。現在病了，總要好的，你們爲什麽忍心把它賣去？况且賣了出去，人家要把它殺的，你們不好把它養在家裏的嗎？」</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>由世界不景氣的影響，於是各國一致以推銷貨物爲惟一的生路。推銷貨物以外，復高築關稅壁壘，以制止外貨的流入。因此一來，甲國防乙國，乙國防丙國，揭開天窗說亮話，是祇要我的貨物，流入人家，不許人家貨物，輸入國内。你看近幾天中，什麽英日會議，英法會議，以及英國議院發急，美國國民恐慌，都是這個毛病。在他們中間你收我緊，你兇我强，最可憐的，無過於我們中國，最該死的，無過於我國國貨界，關稅旣没有自主之權，外人設廠，更没有取締之法。於是而入超七萬萬元，最近一二月來，每月的入超，總在一萬萬元以上。日貨的傾銷，幾如水銀瀉地，無孔不入，而如潮如湧之日貨，滾滾而來，正是方興未艾。傾銷的不足，最近復有在華廣爲設廠的舉動。一把刀扼人之頭，一把刀執人之腕，而我奄奄一息的國貨界，竟没有抵抗的可能。這種情形，不但可憐，而且可痛可悲。辦國貨事業者，苦到如此，可是在上者旣没有體恤的意思，重重捐稅，竭澤而漁。東起西伏的工潮，更不幸隨在觸發，以制工業界的死命。某君很沈痛的說道：『辦國貨工廠，不是人辦的』。這是何等苦惱的話。所以我不希望别的，希望政府趕快見到工廠的危險狀態，以解救其倒懸之急，工人悟到工廠的困難，應同心恊力，扶持進行，然後大家纔可生存，凡屬中國的國民，人人應該拿出良心購買國貨，以自救救國。</p>
<h3 id="c233">國貨年與入超　鮑存明 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>凡是有血的動物，對於外來的壓迫，必有一種嚴峻地反抗，卽使不能用積極的方法，加以迎頭的痛擊，但，至少丨丨尤其是人類，我想起來，因爲他或她們，都是有靈性和理解的丨丨也要用一種消極的方法，誓飛的抵制，以示其精神並未受任何的屈服。</p>
<p>在目前中國的境况下，物質建設是如此之幼穉，軍事國防是如此之疎懈，抵制頑敵的唯一方法，當然是只有消極的，這裏，事實是如此，我並不以爲政府不肯大舉出兵而引作可恨，但對於每國民力量所及的責任，不得不有一些疑慮。</p>
<p>據最可靠的調查，去年中國的貿易狀况是：</p>
<p>進口總額　七二八·三三三·九一六元</p>
<p>出口總額　三一五·四八五·○一六元</p>
<p>計入超　四一二·八四八·九○○元</p>
<p>這眞是一件非常的怪現象，在往年我人没有提倡國貨，標幟國貨年，及抵，制外來經濟侵略丨丨雖有次把局部的提倡國貨及八九次的抵制日貨洋貸，但總没有這次來得嚴重丨丨的時候，雖也有入超，但爲數没有這麽大，而况這次還是大家受了奇辱以後聲嘶力竭的「國貨年」！</p>
<p>同胞們！國家的存在與否，要看它的民衆的精神如何？戰爭還是其次要，這提倡國貨，抵制外來的經濟壓迫，便是民族精的表現，假如照目前的情形，入超額每年激增，那便是中華的民族精神已死，換句話講，中國有立刻滅亡之可能性。</p>
<p>這並不是故意說倒霉的話，事實委實是如此的，入超的數目所以如此之龐大，皆是每個國民造成功的，照去年進口總額算起來，平均每人在國貨年中已買二元的外國貨，你想奇怪不奇怪？總之萬事要從實際上做起，若徒喚「國貨年」「婦女國貨年」「××國貨年」是不見得有效力的。</p>
<h3 id="c234">我對於婦女國貨年應做之工作 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 珊</p>
<p>服用國貨，是人人應盡的天職；不是專靠一部分的青年們或婦女們所成功的。是要全國的親愛同胞共同提倡的，如能同心一致的服用，我想一定能將舶來品完全的消滅。</p>
<p>婦女對於提倡國貨，亦負很大的責任；可是今年是婦女的國貨年，但所負的責任亦格外的重大了。我現在把一切的空話都撇開，只談我對於本年度的婦女國貨年應做之工作，略述如下！</p>
<p>（一）衣食住的方面丨丨我對於衣食住三者的所需，立志不用洋貨，只用國貨；如三項之一遇缺國貨者，决以他物代替。倘我國的同胞，少用一分錢的洋貨，就是爲國家挽回一分利權。願我界的姊妹們，努力行之。</p>
<p>（二）規勸丈夫丨丨假使我的丈夫喜用洋貨的，我應當正色的勸告他，使他不要再用洋貨。如再三不聽勸告，决以「離婚」二字，促其覺悟之。</p>
<p>（三）孩子用的東西丨丨假使我已經有了孩子，那我的孩子，所弄的玩具或其他之物，决不購用洋貨，亦一律購用國貨。</p>
<p>（四）勸告親友服用國貨丨丨喜用外貨的親友，我應該用很誠懇的言語勸告他，使他明瞭我國的國貨，所以不能提倡，就是因爲各同胞不願用國貨，因此各商塲亦不得不私運外貨了。親愛的親友！你要曉得我們多用一分的金錢給牠，就是使他多造一粒子彈，照這様看起來，豈不危險嗎？親友們！你們難道可以不用國貨嗎？</p>
<p>以上所說的四點，都是老生常談，恐諸位亦不願再閱吧？不過我總希望一般的青年們，姊妹們，都能如此的實行下去，我想今年的婦女國貨年，一定能得很大的效果。</p>
<h3 id="c235">婦女在國貨界裏的地位 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>古語有云「敬人者人恒敬之，愛人者人恒愛之，」就是說：你敬愛人家，人家也說得敬愛你，我要換句話說：你敬愛國家，敬愛國貨，人家也就會敬愛你的人格了！婦女丨在封建遺毒之下，素來在社會上是看不起的！現在大家在提高女子地位，情形是不同的，如今年定爲「婦女國貨年」因爲婦女界倘然能够愛用國貨，就是婦女有旋乾轉坤的能力！讀郎魯遜君譯的「古今哲人的女性觀」文裏：他的前奏是「在過去，女人在社說的地位，雖受男權的支配，但社會一切的活動，實際上都以女性爲中心，做丈夫的在家庭裏都唯妻命是聽，家庭是社誠組織的一個細胞，所以社會的一切活動，雖屬諸男人，但他們是傀儡，在背後牽綫的，實在是女人，男人的活動，祇是一種手勢而已」我很確信郎君的話是絕對的對的！</p>
<p>（一）伽藍密却愛理斯夫人說：女人的微笑！是一種世界語。</p>
<p>（二）弗納龍說：男人們不會有什麽成就，要是不得女人的助力，在行動上！</p>
<p>（三）傳利埃說；女權的澎漲，是社會一切進化的最高原則，女人的一顆心，就是她們的靈魂和知慧的源泉！</p>
<p>（四）法杭騷第一皇帝拿波崙說：宫裏面，没有了女人，如一年缺少春天，更如春天少了姣艷玫瑰花！</p>
<p>（五）德國捧喝團高級長官勃鶴西克尼說：我們的婦女，在她們的身上，保持着一種最高估價，最重要的力量！</p>
<p>我讀完之後，覺得婦女在國貨界裏的地位，也是這様的重要！國貨界裏没有了女人提倡，赤心愛國去購用，那眞是糟糕！女人可說是國貨盛衰的樞紐！國貨界裏的權威者！不要形存心死！希望你們拿出娘兒們的力量，來切切實實幹一下，做些成績出來！顯些顔色出來給大家看看，不要天天在矛盾裏過，失却婦的地位！「暢銷國貨」田人正企求你們的助力，而有成就！</p>

<p>而今社會愛摩登，極慾窮奢不可云，海上繁華稱不夜，摩登女子及時新，雪花粉，香水精，來自巴黎法國京，白須錶，看時辰，運來瑞士有名聲，身上衣衫來路貨，皮芏橐橐是高跟，鑽石翻頭耀眼晴，算起來，一身足値數千金，家中陳設歐西北，一般器物盡是外洋國。弄得來，國内金錢輪向外，漏巵難計實傷心，她還說，舶來品物最摩登，那知道，她們錯解摩登意，豈必摩登外國人，中華國貨也摩登，試看那綾羅綢緞多華麗，紗布棉蔴罕比倫，遠勝呢羢千萬分，其他貨物無多讓，何必金錢送外人。物美價廉中國貨，可稱無處不如心，旣經國貨來提倡，又爲愛國又摩登，可知曉，摩登原解稱矛盾，果然矛盾不分明，今年國貨年將去，國貨仍須記在心，大家提倡中華貨，奉勸同胞女界們，古云衆志可成城。</p>
<p>家庭訪問記</p>
<h3 id="c237">潘公展夫人 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 兪洽成</p>
<p>「洋貨的銷塲幾乎大半由城市婦女做主顧，尤以城市中有智識的或」</p>
<p>摩登化的妇女爲最多。故婦女國貨年所應提理的的人們，與其說鄉村婦女，或没有智識的婦女，倒不如說是那些城市中有智識的婦女來的確切。」潘公展夫人唐冠玉女士在婦女國貨年開幕典禮時所講的話，非常的沉痛而且切合實際。</p>
<p>在年初頂冷的冬天，疏疏的雪花飄在家際，我去訪問潘夫人。</p>
<p>客室裏是靜寂的，没有什麽閒雜的聲音，佈置並不怎麽繁華，桌椅是有條理的分佈着；尤其是隔璧書室中傳來的鐘聲，含有詩意的在敲着。此地雖在都市之中，但是，并没有什麽都市的鬧聲。</p>
<p>潘夫人，她是三十左右的人了，穿着國貨綢緞的衣服，從樓上走下來。</p>
<p>我是特地去徵求。關於婦女國貨年工作方面的意見的，當我提出這項問題以後，她略爲沉思些時，作如此的答復：</p>
<p>「今年各團體訂定爲婦將國貨年，是要婦女提倡國貨，振興實業的意思。本來，去年是國貨年，今年再冠上婦女二字，無非是要女界多盡一些力。可是，我覺得今年的婦女國貨運動的工作，要大家都一致起來，要大家共同負責，在這風雨飄摇的國難期中，爲國家民族挽回利權」！</p>
<p>按着，燔夫人并且提出她自自的意見，希望市商會等工商團體，仔細作一番調查的工作，不獨對於劣貨仇貨，就是一般舶來品，使牠和我們的國貨分開；因爲婦女界所負的責任乃是提倡，確立一種標凖乃是實業團體應該給予的帮助。</p>
<p>或許有人不明白婦女要特殊負責提倡國貨的原因吧？潘夫人這裏有强有力的理由：</p>
<p>「我們女界提倡國貨，要有這様見解，就是不使我們很寳貝的子女將來成爲亡國奴！」</p>
<p>天下没有不愛孩子的母親，如果從母愛推廣去愛護國貨，爲着孩子着想，我們的女界努力提倡國貨總是値得的。就是婦女國貨年，男子一些責任没有嗎？在消極方面，也應該有一種帮助。</p>
<p>「同時，希望男界莫要羨慕需要與摩登，讓太太們才可以從儉樸到提倡國貨！」潘夫人的談鋒轉到這裏的時候，代一般女子說出她們的希望。</p>
<p>自後，關有家政問題和兒童問題，我們也曾談及，從潘夫人的意見中，我認清她是時時爲小囝將來着想的，所以，一切的辦法，可以概括的說是兒童本位。本來，在這個年頭兒，所謂摩登的女士們，没有理由的放棄了家庭正軌生活，（旣非因經濟原因參加勞動，也没有政治的原因參加社會事業，）我們如果重新挽回到兒童本位的見解上去，不獨可以减少若干現實的不良消費，對於我們民族的將來貢獻，又是如何的偉大呵！</p>
<p>爲着撫育兒童的方法之研究，更談到中國婦女的社會地位，她覺得已往一般母親無謂的小心，乃是社會對於女界拘束的結果。然而，她仍舊是很樂觀的，以爲往昔中國婦女在重重壓迫之中，曾有過著名的女文人，也有過從軍作戰的巾幗英雄，并且有獲得政權的女子，於是她的結論是：</p>
<p>「歷史所告訴我們的，足見女子并不弱！」</p>
<p>在談話之後，我告辭走出。臨别，潘夫人再三所叮囑的，是對於今年婦女國貨年的工作：</p>
<p>「頂要緊的是調查方面的工作。」</p>

<p>于文學亦何莫不然！七律五古，平平仄仄，無非要抹殺詩情，將自然拘束個盡凈，然後在幾十個字中一扭一揑，自云有工夫。寫字則我的學顔，你的學柳。例如嘉慶皇帝將奏摺的字改了幾個之後，便使一時代的文字，盡趨于鄙俗，一個古字也不敢寫，一個僻字也不敢用，弄到後來較豁達如張文襄者，在四川試士時也還嚕囌了一大通，告訴士子字應怎麽寫，如何缺筆。然而寫字者或作文章者幾乎無一不自誇：至少我的比你的好呢！</p>
<p>然而現代是二十世紀了！人們也都這麽說。但對於西洋雖是十九世紀之後二十一世紀以前的一世紀，在中國似乎不應這麽稱，我們應該自號孔子誕生後二千四百餘年。我們根本擺不開舊的束縛，更說不上新的啓明。剛一維新，便立刻復古，永遠是秋的肅殺，没有春的發揚，抛開律詩作十四行詩，舍却四書味根錄而拾起文學指南，棄却頭巾而加上方博士帽，拿起自來水筆寫「跪禀福安」，其故何也？</p>
<p>大衆現在又努力鑽入舊的網羅，自纒自縛，自以爲有福氣，非常文明！反之却嘲笑，逼迫自由的靈魂，要拉來同歸於盡。但古話說得好「石頭壓草何曾死」，自由的生命是壓不死的啊！</p>
<h3 id="c239">談日本人 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>凡是没有到過日本内地的人，怕誰都不會相信在日本還有良善的人類吧。看見在「滿洲」製造馬賊的日本浪人，看見在「滿洲」賣鴉片販手槍的日本浪人，看見那些開妓館的日本娼婦，我們也許會武斷地說那是代表着日本人民的全部，那是代表着「大和民族」吧。</p>
<p>的確，居留在「滿洲」的日本人，是從没給過我以好印象的。我總以爲他們是「罪惡」的化身。青年時，我總以爲日本人是個個如此的。我對於日本人的觀念，怕是永遠不會變更的，倘若我没有到日本内地生活過的話。</p>
<p>然而，事情是不能以片面來概括全體的。無論在哪個國家，都有好人和歹人。當我到日本去讀書時，我對於日本人的觀念就起了變化。初到日本，我就直覺到日本人在他們本國，待遇中國人，比「滿洲」的那些「居留民」好得多了。至少，没有在「滿洲」的那様的兇惡的神情。其後，入了學校，語言通了，則又遇到了些可以談心的日本朋友。那時，我感到在日本人中也有好人。</p>
<p>在外縣的幾年生活，越法使我對於日本人感到可親了。我覺得日本人樸素而單純。雖然我是異國人，是他們所輕視的「支那人」，可是，一些日本人對我像是並不怎麽歧視似的。自然，我所遇見的日本人，旣不是軍閥，也不是財閥，更不是警察，而是開小商店的，種地的，賣花的等等的樸素的人類。我覺得，我是在優然自得地生活着，並没有被放在受壓迫的空氣中。</p>
<p>一九二四年夏，同□君到了伊東海岸，住在一個農民家中。在那裏，我眞是感到不可思議了。那個農民家中，有一位五十幾歳的老太婆，在八月的炎天裏，她還到山上的地裏去作工。她不知道世界大勢，更不曉得中日關係。她什麽事情都和我們講，當夜間海風吹來，我們坐在門前路旁石上談心的時候。我們給她房銀，她呌我們走時一起算。那種天眞良善的様子，是我從未看見過的。據說，在日本農材中，那種傻人是很多的。</p>
<p>可是，這並不是說日本國内没有壞人，壞人自然是到處有的。在伊東廟裏，我就遇見了一個和尚，擁有巨大的廟産，每年，還「化」得到好多的布施金。他吃得很肥，一妻三子。（和尚娶妻，在日本，是家常便飯。）可是，從他的話語中，我們發現了他有不少的隂謀。而在學校的敎員中也有些人是卑視我們的。</p>
<p>又有一次，從東京回來，在火車中，遇見一個日本人，說是到「滿洲」來謀生活，非常客氣的，求我們一路照顧照顧。雖非淳樸的人，然也不似浪人。一路處還好。可是，在朝鮮鐵路上，接觸了同車的幾個别的日本人，他就有點變様了。到了安東之後，是因爲聽見别的「居留民」談話而了解了自己的地位的原故罷，他就儼然擺出第一等國的大國民的神氣了。對我們連話都不說了。</p>
<p>總之，如果我們有機會對於日本人作近一步的接觸，我們便可知道，在他們里邊，也有壞的，也有好的。</p>

<p>「打一針强心針看看，助她一些力再說。」醫生輕輕聲說着，從藥水瓶内吸了一些藥水。</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>祖母臥在牀上，臉色是由蒼白變成灰暗了；眼晴微張着，似乎有一層白膜罩着，毫没有光彩；嘴巴也張着，在費力的呼吸，胸部跟着狠厲害的一起一伏。</p>
<p>醫生拿了針走近牀邊：</p>
<p>「把她的身體抬起些，好打針。」</p>
<p>伯母把手伸在祖母背後，預備把她的身體抬起，但，立刻就把手收回了。</p>
<p>「醫師，就這様打吧！抬不起，背脊硬……」伯母兩眼滿包着眼淚。</p>
<p>「不要打針了，我……」</p>
<p>粗着舌頭的聲音中斷了，顫動的嘴巴似乎還在講話，最後點了點頭，好像說了聲「再會」，眼睛就漸漸合下去了。</p>
<p>「打針呀！」姑母喊着：「打强心針呀！」眼淚從眼中潮湧出來。</p>
<p>「不能打了。」</p>
<p>「打呀！我要多見一忽兒母姆媽呀！」</p>
<p>祖母像要吐痰，可是痰到了喉管中吐不出來，反塞住了呼吸，胸中波動便隨着靜止了。</p>
<p>姑母跳到牀邊，撲在祖母身上，瘋了般的呌喊着，一面摸着祖母的臉：</p>
<p>「没死呀！還没死呀！鼻子熱着呢？打針呀………」</p>
<p>但不一會兒，房裏充滿了哭聲。</p>

<p>— 魏金枝</p>
<p>「你說的什麽吓？」她簡直有些發怒了，把臉擠得紅紅的，一種崛强的個性毫無隱蔽地露了出來。「我告訴你吓！」她正經地說：「我，爲着要自己生活，獨立的生活，所以才到外邊來做活的。去年，我也賺到了些錢，但没有多少，不願便回去，所以不回去了。可是今年，有人來告訴我：在去年過年時，家裏祇賸父母和二哥以及小侄女，一到過年，二哥往村上賭去了；母親去廟裏唸新年佛去了；一個侄女，在新年裏，她還有不到孩子隊裏去玩的道理麽？於是家裏，光光賸了父親一個人。新年裏，并且還是大年初一吓，一份人家總不能把門掩上，掩上還成一份人家麽？可是，我們家裏是有兩扇門，前門和後門，而家裏却光祗父親一個，於是他，從前門踱到後門，從後門又踱到前門，而新年的往來又多，於是他没辦法，雖然是新年，他祇有一個有坐在床上哭了！」</p>
<p>她說着，眼就紅了起來，我也熱熱的紅了起來。</p>
<p>在平時，我自然也想得到所謂農村經濟破産的現狀，然因是自己家裏的事，倒彷佛未曾想到過似的。一想起來，不錯，就是我家裏，已是個十足的代表。我呢，自然是因爲讀了幾句書，長年在外，而妹子和弟婦，也都爲着自己將來生活的關係，各自奔各自的前程，一家七口，便有一半飄流在外邊。一個平時頗爲熱鬧的家，無形中已是落寞，散失，並無一點人家的様子。於是立刻，在我傷感的腦裏，浮起一幅這様的圖畫：</p>
<p>「婦女們在正屋的堂前，吃花生瓜子，孩子們在滾銅板，都穿着新衣服，不做事團聚着，說着一些不關緊要的話。而我父親，他正坐在由正屋通到偏屋去的一間過路房裏。那裏，平時就是他的房，彷彿一顆蜘蛛似的他佔據着我家的樞紐。現在，他也穿一件也結婚時穿過的那土綿綢的棉袍子，一雙布襪，一雙有鼻子的鞋，坐在他常住的微暗的床邊，不用手巾，也不用袖口，却用他自己生硬而顫抖的手揩眼涙。那手，牠是辛勤，勞働，撫養過我們的手，牠該是早就閒散的手，而現在抹着眼淚。」</p>
<p>於是第二次，我的眼重新焦熱起來，我擦着淚，一面却强笑地和妹妹說道：「我回去的，我不過騙騙你，我是要和你一道回去的。」</p>
<p>第二天，我們冒着雪，風，一道回到家裏去了！</p>

<p>— 問鵑</p>
<p>一碧無垠的海水，不知何時在牠的一角上已被塗上了灰黃的顔色，於是這絕對不能調和的二重顔色的海水，便永永相持着在一座孤島的身邊呶呶爭辯，彷彿要求的判斷，可是這座小島的自身似乎也有隱憂存在着，只是默然注視這些海水而永永不能給牠們一個解答　　這小島就是有名的香港，也正是我這次旅行的目的地。</p>
<p>初上岸，看見一切的店舗並不怎様堂皇華麗，而且市面也很蕭索，我心上想：人人都說香港好，香港的好處究竟在那裏呢？</p>
<p>趕到××街，找着了□□君，他是久居此地的人，很熟悉此間的一切，我便把方才的疑問說給他聽了，他只是笑而不答。吃過飯，他就帶我出街游玩，平坦光滑的馬路，樹隂夾道，這些也和上海差不多，可是走着走着，脚下的路面却在漸漸升高起來，曲折地轉了幾個彎，回頭一望，自己身子已在半山中了，面前盡是縱横屈曲的柏油路，配着這道濃綠的山崗，正像無數條銀灰色的絲帶，緊束在一堆翠玉上面。山崗的斷面，却用深黃或是棕色的碎石砌成花紋狀，石缝的中間，開遍了許多不知名的野花，花瓣的巨大，顔色的濃艷，大概都是近熱帶的植物了。山徑下面流着一條的澗水，雖是人工築成的，可是那琮琮琤琤的聲间也很可聽。黑色的鐵欄缭繞在所有的山道和水溝的兩岸，遠看很像珠網。一輛汽車從花木織成的網幕下倐然鑽出，又倐然消失在叢林深處。無數顔色不同的建築物躱在綠蔭下面，靜靜地做着牠們的美夢。四周什麽聲音也没有有，只有山家小犬的吠聲打破這空間的岑寂。</p>
<p>「竟是個絕美的大花園！」我對着香港的全景驚嘆了。</p>
<p>「中國人手裏的荒島，一落到英國人的掌握，便變成了勝地。從國家的觀念上說，割地當然是件不幸的事，可是在寄身此地的中國人，尤其是愛好秩序及富於美的賞　力的中國人看來，也許正有着相反的觀念吧！」正說着，忽聽得山上一陣喧閙，接着就有許多人奔下山來，一路亂跑亂撞，呌着笑首，那種無秩序無組織的情形，和他們身邊的整齊的建築物一對比，使人有說不出來的感觸。他們大約都是香港的土生子，年輕的女人穿着大褲子子，（没有裙）腦後垂一條大辮，手上有的帶着銀鐲也有不帶手鐲而戴脚鐲的。年紀大一點的則多梳着髮髻，挿着簪珥，和長江一帶二十年前的裝束差不很。和她們同伴的男人們則没有辮子，手裏拿的是鳥籠和烟袋等類。從他們的皮膚營養和服裝華麗上看來，他們是有着很好的物質生活的；可是在他們的表情和言語中間，却怎様也找不出一絲敎養的痕跡。這些大概就是殖民地上典型好的百姓了。</p>
<p>在下山的時候，夾道的花香，海的柔和和氣息，與濃烈的鴉片烟香混作一片，牠們的永不調和的氣息，也許就是香港的特色。</p>

<p>「那末，你什麽時候去說呢？現在我向你一起去好不好？」</p>
<p>「去；我還有一些别的事。回頭我要到辦公室去的。總在這一兩天以内，我給你回音。」</p>
<p>一天過去了，没有回音；兩天過去了，没有回音。到了星期六，二十七日；到了那天的下午，依娜耐不不住了，她只能再去找着席卓雲。</p>
<p>「你來了，我正想要寫信給你，」卓雲一邊招待依娜坐，一邊說。</p>
<p>她坐下在那只她所慣坐的客位中，可是不說話。</p>
<p>「事情怕有些糟了。你聽我說。本來，這里的職員，本月份的薪水是可以預支的，可是這個月，是人家都很須錢用的年底，經理却下了一個通告，說誰也不能預支薪水。我們推了兩個代表去要求，也已被拒絕了。你想，這裏的職員，他們也待得這麽刻薄，何况是你們外人？不要說你的小說還没有義表，稿費拿不到，就是已發表的，甚至連一月份的稿費，也已决定不發。剛才已經有幾個人來過，要求發稿費，可是都没有辦法。」</p>
<p>依娜没有話說，只是凝眼望着他。</p>
<p>他在隨便翻着桌上的書，信件等等。最後他抽出一封信交給依娜。</p>
<p>她以爲是關於她的事的，可是看了才知是那里的一個校對寫給席卓雲的。因爲那校對聽得他的職位有動摇的消息，在哀求席卓雲帮忙。她看完了，把那信交還給他，一邊在想，他爲什麽要她看那封信呢？難道他在向她暗示她給他的信寫得不够謙遜，同那校對的信比較起來？還是他在誇耀着有人在哀求他？他會把她看作在哀求他的人們中的一個嗎？他也會把她給他的信拿給别人看，正如他剛才把那校對的信給她看一様嗎？他爲什麽要她看那封信呢？</p>
<p>「你看，都没有辦法」，他看她不作聲，便這様慨歎似地說。</p>
<p>依娜覺得她的眼睛有些澀，用力强忍着。</p>
<p>卓雲一時也沉默着，靜便緊裹在他們的周圍。</p>

<h3 id="c291">未許樂觀 <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>最近視察華北外交歸來之外部次長唐有任氏，對其一年來目覩實况之經過，特於二十四日發表談話，認爲：「足跡所至，感慨滋多，非一言所能盡」，但約而言之，華北情勢「未許樂觀，其演變如何，要在吾人在内政外交上如何作繼續努力而已。</p>
<p>這一藴蓄而有意味的經過談，我們諦聆之下，揆其絃外之音，爲之慨嘆惋惜，亦爲之警戒惕勵。東北數省自「九一八」砲聲一響，轉瞬失亡，我們這本已病弱的中國，就爲得急性感冒罹了不起之症。正如人之將死祈求上帝赦罪一般，不少的人正慶幸着「和平之神」的國聯，採納了李頓報告書，通過一紙不承認僞組織的决議，認爲「正義得伸」。外交得勝。但是滿懷着實現大陸政策的木屐朋友，决不以除去反對票一席而全體一致的國聯决議就有所畏懼，並且懂得剛能克柔的道理，定然不以區區三省爲饜足。所以榆關一失守，登時熱河異色，灤東告急。我們没有辦法，只好抱「和平」主旨，彼此諒解，以求寗人息事。</p>
<p>但是以非軍事區爲界的停戰恊定，不過是與劃鴻溝爲界一様的滑稽，不但木屐朋友可以隨時藉口來進擾，而且正如當時漢高祖陳兵廣武近窺彭城一様，戰區也者，就成了政治經濟控制華北的憑藉，所以戰爭的惡麽雖隨和平之清風以俱去，但另一種方興未艾的政治經濟勢力却抑制了華北。遠者有比討荆州還要困難的收回榆關與長城各口，不僅一年來未能竣事，且復已非原璧，近來的平津軍事操演，孰謂非榻側容人强兵壓境之勢。</p>
<p>此其顯而見者，若者之其他瑣聞細事，又如何不能尋得出一點蛛絲馬跡。傀儡袍笏登塲時，天津日租界廣作宣傳大開慶祝；著名典型魔又，在東北上海曾建奇功的密探川島芳子之遊北平；荒木忠次之暗訪外人敎堂地址財産；這都是與内蒙問題新疆獨立的事件此響彼應。至若「劣貨」之充塞於華北各省，甚至膠濟路因之大見「繁盛」等事實，我們展顧將來，不欲言且不忍言，蓋亦「感慨滋多，非一言所能盡」也。</p>
<p>古人云：威信者立國之本也，有威方能取信，在這様喧賓奪主的情形下，華北局勢恐怕眞如唐氏所云，「未可樂觀」，我人將如之何而可也。</p>
<h3 id="c292">妻與戀人 <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦子</p>
<p>妻是一個不祥的名詞。有妻的大概總不愛其妻，而只愛纞人。戀人眞是一個甜蜜的東西。妻無論怎様好，然而總歸平常，因爲妻「玩」得太久了，所以有好而不覺其好，而戀人則是可近而不可嫟的人，且多屬半公開的性質，不能盡情享樂，所以便覺餘味不盡，特别値得追戀。所以古人說得好：「妻不如妾，妾不如婢，婢不如偷，偷不如偷不着」這眞說盡了妻與戀人的秘密。人就是這様歡喜偷偷摸摸做事的，越是偷摸越覺新奇，一到公開，倒反而索然無味了。情慾眞是奇怪的東西。</p>
<p>人爲什麽這様只愛戀人而不愛妻呢？普通人以爲這是「喜新厭舊」的人類天性使然。其實不然的。這是完全爲客觀社會，物質關係所决定的。當人類社會初起之時，兩性的結合，本來是從自然很本能的，迨後因財産關係發生，又不幸而這財産關係爲男子所握得，於是女子才變成了男子的附屬物，更由附屬物而變成玩物。經過幾行年的禮敎束縛，女子就永遠變成一種男子統御下的奴隸階級了。到現在，社會本質由封建經濟一變而爲資本主義經濟，女子地位，也隨着變更，由封建性質轉變到資本主義性質，就是從前女子是由禮敎所規定的，現在則爲金錢所規定了。從前女子是封建禮敎下的犧牲品，現在則是資本家金錢下的犧牲品，從前女子屈服於禮敎，現在女子則屈伏於金錢，從前女子是禮敎的俘虜，現在女子則是金錢的俘虜，女子由從前禮敎下烈婦節婦，一變而爲現在資本主義社會市塲上的商品要有錢，誰都可以買賣的了。這就是現在的情形。從以上所述，我們可知婦女的所以成爲男子的附屬物，自始就是由於社會物質的關係，而女子的所以成玩物，使男子可以隨時對女子發揮其厭舊喜新的本能，女子不能自主的主張其與異性之結合，則是由於這社會的物質關係，破壞了人類本能的自然的兩性結合，才造面這種男女不平等的現象。這，從以上說明，我們是可以瞭然的了。</p>
<p>因爲現在兩性的結合，不是由於本能的自然的要求，而是由於物質的關係，所以兩性之間，除了赤裸裸的利害關係之外，便别無所謂愛情上的結合。任你說愛情怎様濃密，歸根給底，還不過都是一種利害上的相合，不過這根本上的利害關係，往往被表面上的熱烈底情慾所隱蔽着罷了。公子哥兒們懷裏所擁抱着的美人兒，表面也可說是愛情的結合罷，而其實澈底講一聲，誰敢說是他不是用金錢買來的？假使不是用金錢買來的，那末爲什麽世上的美女子，獨歸有錢人所得，而窮措大只能弄一些不堪入目的平常女子呢！現在的兩性結合，旣完全建基於赤裸裸的利害關係之上，而不是建基於本能的自然的結合，則其基礎的不穩固，也就可想而知了。男子旣可以全錢買這個女子，他當然再可以用金錢買别個女子；而女子方面呢，他旣可因利害關係而賣給這個男子，一到這利害關係發生變動時，卽這男子不能滿足女子慾求時，他當然也可另再去賣給别人。這様，婚姻變成罪惡，戀愛變成動摇，婚姻與戀愛，大家嘆息着是完全破産了。</p>
<p>婚姻將戀愛果眞破産了嗎？「結婚是愛情的墳墓」，結婚果眞是愛情的墳</p>

<p>— 辛子</p>
<p>（上）</p>
<p>結婚是戀愛的墳墓這一個問題，是在現代才明顯的而被人們呌喊出來的；特别是在資本主義的惡箭射遍了全世界以後的許多丨丨離奇，複雜，而爲人們所不能明白的解釋的現象的發生中，無法對於結婚和戀愛這個交纒不清的大問題加以正確的解决，所以就消極的喊着；結婚是戀愛的墳墓。近日新上海則刊有蕊珠女士的「結婚不是戀愛的墳墓」恰恰是相反的她的論據，差不多就是從她所謂自身的結婚生活中的體騐的證明，加以分析，而得出來的空虛的結論。而且，她末尾總有力的說：「總之，青年男女們如果能以赤誠的心，無條件的相愛，那末，誰說結了婚，也不致感到戀愛進了墳墓的痛苦」。</p>
<p>前後二者的理論，都是片面的，毫　　　　　　　　展開出來，只是膚淺的說明了現象的外形的一面而已。他們都是承受了祖傳的羅輯的方法，把資本主義社會千變萬化的社會諸般現象的飛演，用孤立的，靜止的眼光去觀察，把一隅的社會現象，輕輕的就認爲這是客觀的眞實的存在了。</p>
<p>本來，結婚和戀愛都是，類的生理上和精神上所正當需要的一種必然而合理的事情，牠本身是一點罪惡没有的，卽是結婚和戀愛都是，類的社會生活所必需要的基本東西。而所以合理的東西，會發生許多惡劇，而成爲被人們看成是等於進入墳墓那麽的可怕呢？這完全是社會的不良的經濟基礎所給予牠的毛病呵！我們且翻開結婚生活之史的發展，就可以明白：結婚這東西不是從開頭起就是把戀愛送進墳墓去，而是到了某一個階段的社會生活的變動，給予結婚滲染了痛苦，使結婚後發生許多悲劇或　　　　　　　，而　　　　　　　　那　　烈的　愛。所以在　建社會裏的結婚生活的不滿，因爲舊禮敎之威嚴而不敢提出離婚，到了資本主義社會，較可以自由結合與離異，於是問題就喧囂地被人們提出來了，以爲戀愛是神聖，快樂，一結了婚就討厭，痛苦。誠然，在如此不合理的社會制度底下，人們的結婚生活，就因之而發生了許多不合理的現象，然而這全是悲慘的社會生活所予他們的反映呵！</p>

<p>上午要上第二堂的課的時候，接到曼的信，看他那麽大的字我已經手在發抖了，何况信裏眞的報告給我一個不好的消息：他病了，我的心在跳動，週身有點發冷似地血液在收縮，不知如何是好！</p>
<p>那一課是還琴的，來不及請假，托小陳和×先生說明，立刻跑出校門來。平時黃包車那麽多，今天一部都没有。好像故意和我爲難似地都躱藏起來了。從華界到租界那一段路，平時還不覺得討厭，今天人家心裏有事要走快，那路上的石頭泥塊者是在阻碍着你的脚步的移動，眞是要我的命。跑過了橋，急得一身汗，好容易才看見一部黃包車，也没工夫和他講價錢，坐上去就呌他快跑。他實在也在拔步的跑，可是我心裏的希望快的速率總比較他在跑的快得好多，比方起來，我的心是好像汽車一様地在跑，他的腿却是好像牛車一様地在走，這眞是使我氣死了。我連呌他快點快點，而平心一想，自己也覺得好笑。平時我坐在黃包車上是喜歡看到路邊的樹，留心牠茁芽發葉没有，或者看看路上在走路的男男女女，品評這個品評那個，今天我的眼睛裏什麽都看不到，眼前幻想出曼的病容來，而心裏在急要知道他是什麽病。前幾天見面的時候，不是還是好好的嗎，怎麽就生起病來的呢？忽然想起看過報紙上載過，春天以來天氣不調，病人很多，小孩子天花尤其多，而傷風感冐的人更是所在都是。他是傷風感冐？他是天花？不，天花是小孩子的病，他那裏會天花！</p>
<p>下了車，急急打他的門，進了門，　　　樓，到了進了他的屋裏，看見他雖將負着的一塊夫石放下，輕鬆起來。</p>

<h3 id="c297">論明星的出路 <a href="#c297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— 雋</p>
<p>市塲的不景氣，凡百事業均深受打擊，而一切薪俸階級的人們，尤爲感到莫大的恐慌，如减亲裁員等等不幸的遭遇，新聞記載幾無日無之。别的不論，單看電影界的從業員對於生活的一種不安狀態。已足令人爲之扼腕的了。</p>
<p>因爲覺得前途的黯淡，目前的供給不能滿足，於是大家都種下了改行的志願；果敢者便去實行，猶豫不决者當然不在少數，但每個人多少總具有這種心理的。而充舞女却作爲一般女明星們無出路中的出路，他們的理由是：舞女的收入比較做電影演員强得多，爲要求得一個舒適的物質環境，寗願去做那種被摟抱生涯，不願再幹演電影的苦行當，這當然痛快得多了。這事實，以前有梁賽珍可資作證，昨某報又記載宣景琳亦將做舞女去了，首作俑者雖尙無幾，但此後繼而起者則難加以逆料，本來由電影明星改業爲舞女，特不過是個人職業的轉換而已，不値得怎様大驚小怪的，然而在這種繼續發生的事體之下，我們倒不能完全忽略過去的，電影明星的充舞女是否是臻於萬不得已始出此，抑或已經認爲舞女是唯一無二的出路，假如僅僅是爲了自己的物質生活起見，而抛棄他們的工作和任務，去遷就一種只顧目前的奢侈生活，那就没有什麽意義可言，亦爲智者所不取了，電影職業固然清苦，但現在似乎並不會陷於絕無方法維持的地步，而且電影的前途也並非没有發展的可能，若果刻苦一點奮門下去，將來也許更有所收獲吧，就在社會的見解上，總較之作爲舞女有意義的。</p>
<p>總之，如果是簡單因爲眩於物質慾的誘惑而去作舞女，無論其理由如何充分，根本是不能視爲正確的行徑，至於存心利用明星的商標，藉作宣傳生意的廣告，那不獨有辱明星自身的聲價，而且是電影界的敗類，凡屬眞正從事電影業的人們，應該加以嚴重的注意，防制同様事體的發生，使電影陣綫不致形成崩潰的現象，而拯救電運於萬一。</p>

<p>又下雨了，屋瓦上的水滴滴答答地滴在階沿上，一聲聲的大風，也點綴在這靜寂的空間，玻璃穿受了風的擊動，都在相互地震響着，大地上是死一般的靜默除了階沿上點滴的雨水和窗前滴答的鐘聲，啊！雨夜，春日的雨夜！</p>
<p>時間已是午夜，忍心地等待着的她還没有回來，也許她今晚又要破曉才可回來……她已經陶醉在另一個男子的懷抱裏了。可是我不敢這麽様去想，這太可怕了。</p>
<p>又是一陣大風大雨過去了，擊得門窗都響起來。</p>
<p>愁人終究是愁人，整個的頭在發燒般的，翻來覆云都睡不着，可怕的現像在我眼前映起來了：爵士的音樂正在麻醉一般的青年，她當然正投在紳士的懷抱裏，破他的手緊緊地擁抱着，嚼着香糟的嘴在甜吻她。……</p>
<p>也是在這様一個多雨的春天，我認識她在她的故鄉裏，那時她還是一個含情默默的鄉下大姑娘，她見我自大都會裏歸去的青年，也就不竟愛了我，我們就有一度愛好，以至成了現在貌合神離，同牀異夢的名義上的夫婦的關係。我們回到了上海，她受了一度的都市的薰染，而變成了現在的她。</p>
<p>在精神上，她已不是我的人了，是呀！什麽東西都不勝於物質的誘惑呀！呵，都市化的薰陶，物質强有力的誘惑，就這様把一個鄉下的大姑娘變成了摩登小姐。</p>

<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>爲了紀念死去的父親和祖母，所以一年一度的，總是照例地要返鄉去掃一次墓。這，就算是盡了人子之道！</p>
<p>這幾天，雖然已是春天了：可是一些暖意都没有，仍舊寒冷得很。而且，天氣又是這麽地亢旱，河裏的水差不多已將要乾枯了。</p>
<p>吾於三月七日搭乘八點鐘快車抵蘇；有幾處因爲水小得太利害了，因此小火輪都停駛了。吾們特地雇了一隻小汽油船，當駛到胥口的時候，西北風又呼呼地怒吼起來，後來仍舊駛回木凟，凖備明天清晨再開。晚飯後：七點鐘敲過，看看風色似首靜寂了。遂大家商量開夜船。這時好在天空中已滿佈着不少的星星，星星發出來的光芒，隱約可以辨出大自然裏的一切景物。在十一時就抵了故鄉，别了好久的故鄉。</p>
<p>夜之神更張開了巨大的兩翼，籠罩着整個的大地，在荒漠的山野，一切都顯得靜寂，靜寂得可怕！</p>
<p>這時，市鎭上的店舖都已關了門，眼前只有幾條縱横的街道，靜靜地躺着。没有地方去買燈，只好借着一些星星之光去摸索。道路的崎嶇，橋樑的頽坦，實在使吾有脚步難移之感。寒氣的襲人，使吾們不堪忍受。但，終究摸到了老家，老家是三椽破屋，有一個繼承的祖母看守着，然而，這祖母雖祇一年不見，可是更老態龍鍾了。</p>
<p>第二天，天氣是那様的清朗，吾們預備了牲禮冥鏹等物，到祖父和父親墳上去祭掃。</p>
<p>當吾踏上了墳山，在祖母和父親的墓前去巡禮了番，想起了父親，回憶到祖母，不禁使吾兩行熱淚撲𫃊𫃊地淌濕了衣襟。祖母和父親的遺容，彷彿已在吾眼前湧現；但是，但是，他們那裏知道，吾這不肖的孫兒，在這裏想　　們呢？他們也不能來安慰吾這空虛的心靈。他們一世辛勞，僅留得幾塊山，幾塊地，幾間屋給吾們，可是祖母那様年青就死了祖父，父親又這麽年輕就與世永别，吾的母親又老早守了寡，吾現在也是一個孩子的父親了。那麽，吾將有些什麽來遺給孩子？吾更將有些什麽去安慰死去的祖母和父親，還有一個健在的母親，吾只好慚愧！</p>
<p>最近，吾在鏡中看到自己，已這麽地蒼老了，一個二十多歳的青年，竟這様的蒼老，眞把吾驚駭得戰慄！</p>

<h3 id="c302">賴斯蒲丁案詳情（上） <a href="#c302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— 滄桑</p>
<p>米高梅公司被控影射</p>
<p>舊俄皇姪女追償損失</p>
<p>舊俄皇族因「賴斯蒲丁」影片有侮辱公主的地方，曾向英國法庭起訴，要求米高梅公司賠償損失二萬五千鎊。此案哄傳一時，本刊亦已登載過簡單的情報。此案不僅是電影界一樁重要事件，且爲歷史上一重公案，爰再將其詳情錄之如下。</p>
<p>賴斯蒲丁是歐戰時俄國的一個惡魔。影片的名稱是「魔僧賴斯蒲丁」，無聲片曾在上海演過，有聲片以巴里摩亞兄妹三人爲主角，原排定在大光明開幕的時候公映的，後恐白俄滋事才作罷。這案的原告是舊俄沙皇的姪女愛琳那主公，嬪於姚沙伯夫親王，同住在巴黎。原告控訴的理由說是片中的那泰夏公主有影射她的地方。被告米高梅公司的反駁說那泰夏不過是揑搆的物，與姚沙伯夫公主並無牽涉。開庭之後，陪審員便檢視影片的内容。</p>
<p>愛琳那公主是舊俄僅存的皇族。她的母親現在英國，是故沙皇妹。她的父親是大公之一，且爲沙皇姪。姚沙伯夫親王也是舊俄皇室的碩果。他的先祖在給俄羅斯征服之前，曾爲韃韁王，在革命前擁有廣田美産。親王與公主在一九一四年結儷。在本案開審的時候，他們都出庭作證。</p>
<p>這影片描寫賴斯蒲丁在大戰初年的歷史。姚沙伯夫親王靨惡他在宫庭無惡不作，遂把他殺死，以爲這是替俄民除暴的天職。故這片實是一部悲劇，其中牽涉的人物有沙皇，皇后和皇太子。戀愛的一幕說有涉及公主的嫌疑。劇本以一九一三年羅門諾夫皇朝在莫斯科宫庭舉行三十週年大慶。愛琳那公主卽於這盛大宴會中宣布與姚沙伯夫親王訂婚。一九一四年，他們倆便在御前舉行大婚</p>
<p>不期同房花燭之後，歐戰便爆發了，賴斯蒲丁便出現了。他本是一個鄉農，稍有妖術，人故以僧侣視之。他爲人粗暴無比，藉妖術歛錢。適幼沖的皇太子罹了奇疾，無人能治，皇后可很鍾愛他，因之非常着急。全歐的名醫都召到了，可是皇儲仍舊出血不止，危在旦夕。賴斯蒲丁在西藏得了秘方，自稱能够救治，他後來居然把他治好了，於是皇后感激之餘把他留在宫中，太子不能須臾離開他。賴斯蒲丁在宫庭的權勢因此比沙皇還要煊赫。俄國朝野相率側目而視，認他的地位是一種危害。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c303">評「木偶寄情」 <a href="#c303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— 滄桑</p>
<p>“I　Am　Suzanne”丨大上海丨</p>
<p>「木偶寄情」是一部非常難得的諷世影劇，陳義的高深，和技巧的精奥，無疑地令人驚爲電影藝術的奇績。鑒賞之後，能使人啞然失笑，也能使人放聲大哭。它深刻地諷刺世人憧憧往來於名利之塲，局外人看來，無非是木偶串戲，一經道破，未免啞然失笑了；在另一面，供人作牛馬，至於力竭聲嘶，斷脛折股而不自惜，一念回頭又不得不放聲大哭。此中重要關節，在於人的醒悟不醒悟而已。如能憬然而悟，那就應了佛家所謂「四大皆空」和「回頭是岸」的話語了。否則，惟有終其身被人牽着綫做傀儡，做醉生夢死的把戲；世事變幻又那一件不是如此，這片因愈覺其痛切深刻。</p>
<p>這部影劇的本事，雖屬平凡，然而藝術上的成功却是非常的難能可貴。我可肯定的說這是多才多藝的麗琳哈蕙的傑作。這片的陳義非常高深，然而倘使没有能歌能舞，有聲有色的麗琳哈蕙爲主角，誰也不能有這様感人甚深的成績。而導演兼編劇李樂倫能利用麗琳哈蕙的技藝，編排發揮到出神入化的境地，增加這片成功的要素，其勞績亦屬不可磨滅。麗琳哈蕙和李樂倫眞可當相得益彰之評語。據說這是麗琳哈蕙厭倦銀幕生活，行將退隱的紀念片，那末導演李樂倫憐惜她一向被人恭維爲紅明星，實際上不過做好萊塢的摇錢樹，特編這「木偶寄情」影劇，表示惜别之意，李先生亦是有心人也。</p>
<p>這片在電影藝術上有重要的價値。現在略舉幾點以概其餘。第一，全局排佈得當。因爲這片的主旨，在於諷刺不偶生活，有的以人爲木偶，有的以木偶爲人，兩個相反的塲面，相間着演出，一幕緊凑一幕，一幕偉大一幕。以人爲傀儡的，衣於斯，食於斯，富貴於斯，描寫得淋漓盡致。在這一局面裏被人奉爲傀儡的是一位名呌蘇珊的舞女，這「蘇珊小姐一芳名在廣告上，房門的名牌上，以及人的口中一再點出。而這傀儡的牽綫人以歛錢爲目的，却是高冠燕服儼然衣冠中人，他的高冠禮服，始終未曾脫去，實有深意。在另一局面裏，以木偶爲人的却表出玩世的意味，無數木偶，衣冠楚楚，形形色色，蔚成大觀，確是一種極好的反面文章。</p>
<p>第二，全局的轉變最深刻也最有聲色。本片的劇情以至愛無上主義爲歸宿。提醒傀儡使他們從新做人的大力不是名利而是愛，這一點最精彩，譬如「蘇珊小姐」於一夢之中，恍惚地先給一條大繩套在頸項，然後給百結蛛網，渾身綑住。於是偉大的背影中有惡魔，有火燄，有夜义，麗琳哈蕙便於這裏表演其絕技，竭力描寫挣扎，最後抛入火燄，一道青光，塲面急轉，易活地獄而爲人間世了，「蘇珊小姐」於此一夢黃梁，憬悟了爲人之道，成爲「我是蘇珊」了。</p>
<p>第三，說白甚有可取。本片陳義高深，得力於說白的地方也甚多。編劇者借劇中人的話語痛駡世人的Puppeteering，也是成功的一點。這因限於篇幅，讀者自己去領會吧。</p>
<h3 id="c304">評「烈熖」 <a href="#c304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>丨丨北京映丨丨</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>誰說春天已經來到人間？當我從北京大戲院出來的時候，不是大家都緊縮着頭而喊着冷嗎？「這是春天的冬天」，我想。</p>
<p>就在這苦雨凄風中，我回憶着「烈焰」所給與我的印象。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>烈焰！這個劇名該是多麽雄偉啊。正如作者所宣示給我們的，烈焰，在不住的焰燒。燒毁了東北的半壁山河，燒毁了上海的繁榮，更延燒着長江的兩岸。有千萬的災民在火光中奔逃哭喊！地們給烈焰燒毁，他們給烈焰滅亡。但是誰來撲滅這烈焰呢？誰來拯救這千萬災民呢？世界上儘有着隔岸觀火的人們，正如片中所暗示給我們的臨流歡笑的紳士太太們之風度。我們只有自救，用我們自己的力量，撲滅這烈焰，在餘灰淺燼之中，建築起我們自己的地上的天堂。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>的確，劇作者有着新的世界觀，他在作品中不平凡的展開了民族戰爭的前途。當阿桂看見閘北之熊熊火光的時候，他敲響了警鐘，他號召了自破屋中奔出的廣大的勞苦羣衆，在狂呼大喊聲中爲自身而奮鬭。此外他也告訴我們，當烈焰在延燒草棚的時候，没有救火員，也没有救火的工具，於是他們只得眼看着自身財産之毁滅，同時更貽隔岸觀火之譏。但是當娱樂的不愼而燒着了高大洋房的時候，同様是火燒，却有科學的救火車爲之撲滅。何况你公度立刻可以從保險公司得着大批的賠欵，不久便可從新造起新的别墅。烈焰對於他們是不會受着何等損害的。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>那末，導演胡銳是怎様的理解這一劇本的呢？他是否把握了劇的重心呢？</p>
<p>很明顯的，他是避重就輕，他將戀愛部份特别誇張，反之，他將上述的劇的重心却輕輕帶過，甚至於用着吞吞吐吐的口吻。這是不可掩飾的事實。但是導演爲什麽要如此呢？雖然我們不會忽視人們都有着不同的苦衷，不過爲了適應環境而在自己作品中先行打一折扣，這不能不是藝人最痛心的事罷。我們固然同情作者的舊心，但是他得認識作者的怯弱。</p>
<p>據說原劇本上說明草棚的起火，是由於地主家宴客的火星所引着的，但是在畫面我們却看見阿桂的老婆的不愼。由此例推，作者的確是自動删改不少。</p>
<p>據藝華公司宣稱，本片「尺寸未剪」，果眞如此，則中國電影大有希望。不然作者便極聰明的做到了使其「尺寸未剪」的程度。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>關於技術問題，攝影極佳，燈光的調合爲中國片少有之成績。鏡頭亦甚活潑，但有些地方（如鷄心或九角星等）却弄巧成拙。演員的演技亦頗可取，只是胡萍在前段飾農家女時不够逼眞。</p>
<p>至於導演對於調子的律動，却不够純熟。我以爲慢動作破壞了緊張的空氣，救火塲面應當更簡短迅速。假使用慢的動作而不能表現出沉着的力的時候。那末無疑義是失敗的了。</p>

<p>「雲裳艷曲」爲美國華納影片公司與美國第一國家公司合作之結晶品，英文原名爲Ｆashi-ons　of　I1934（一九三四年之新裝）。此片不日將放映於南京。該公司去年所製之三巨片卽「四十二街」（４２nd　Street），「歌舞昇平」（Gold-diggers　of　1933），「華清春暖」（Foot-Ilghtparade）等早已膾炙人口，但「雲裳艷曲，」於名歌，妙舞，劇情方面實遠過之。内有一九三四年新式服裝之展覽，竟將法京巴黎時妝藝術之秘密，暴露無遺，滬上閨閣名媛，愛美人士，想必以先睹爲快也。</p>

<p>— 文印</p>
<p>很侷促地威爾向瓊娜表示着道歉。他說他的母親一定没有這様吩咐過那些黑人……她要是知道了，一定不答應的………他後來又請求瓊娜去參加跳舞會。瓊娜摇着頭不肯答應。威爾說他的母親一定很喜歡見她的，她說他們全家都喜歡她去。他懇切地求着。瓊娜因爲剛才花的緣故，自己好像小氣似的，有些難爲情，但是威爾說他此來係專誠來邀請的。這様，瓊爾因爲他的態度十分懇切，所以明知道他的話是假的，但是不便竣拒，也就答應了。</p>
<p>這已是當天的晚上了。康納萊坐在大椅子裏，注視着一對一對的舞伴，在翩翾地舞着。她旁邊站着她的女兒吉拉婷。康納萊夫人對着吉拉婷道：「威爾又在和那個女子跳舞了。」她的聲音很低，但充滿了着藴怒不發的聲氣。她繼續着道：「我要是早知道威爾是那麽没有腦筋的………我亦不請那個性但德的女子來了………唉，那一點花的値價太貴了………」她們母女二人瞪着眼看着。那個纎小的身材，穿着樸實不華的衣裙，很有姿態的在威爾的臂膀裏旋轉着，她的眼睛，光彩四射地看了威爾的面龐。一回吉拉婷又埋怨她的母親道：「你請了傑克漢姻敦來，亦没有什麽好處呀。你不看見他整夜的追隨着佛琴妮嗎？」</p>
<p>羅伯走了上來。他喝了許多西皮奥自己做的私酒，因爲他不喜歡喝那菓子水。他醉眼惺松地問康納萊夫人道：「跳舞會怎様了，那歡樂的跳舞會？」康納萊夫人摇着頭道：「威爾豈有此理，太對不起佛琴妮了。」老羅伯道：「那於佛琴妮是有好處的。有的時候男人態度」</p>
<p>冷淡了些，倒會使女人怪和氣的。「他說完了，格格地笑着。康納萊夫人埋怨他道：「那於威」</p>
<p>爾有什麽好處呢？」一回兒她又看着瓊娜苗條的體態，自言自語說道：「這簡捷是個狐狸精。」</p>
<p>這裏是不歡迎的。」羅伯道：「我歡迎她，她使我想起了　我已喪失的青春。」康納萊夫人咬着嘴唇，恨恨地說道：「很不幸的足，威爾這種行爲，亦使我想起了………我還是贊成你的青春，永遠埋藏着不動吧。」</p>
<p>瓊娜突然間感覺到不安起來，她已經覺到了康納萊夫人的眼光，太嚴勵了。………羅伯的眼光，亦有些特别………威爾好像知道她的不安似的，他將瓊娜領到花園裏，那裏有一個吊床，是從舊馬車的車身做的，用幾修繩子吊在一棵櫟樹上。威爾和瓊娜坐下了。他坐在她的身旁，覺得她是多末可愛呀，多來可敬呀。他的心跳躍着。他的手在背後彎了過去，圍住了她的香肩。他閒談着康納萊大厦已往的故事，南北戰爭的歷史上幾個有名的大人物，統通曾經在那裏受過欵待的。瓊娜的頭仰着，靠在威爾寛闊的肩胛上，她好似陶醉地聽着。夜色是多末可愛………景物是多末可戀………她覺得好像她是此地的一個久居者………她正在如疵如夢的當兒，突然閒有人呌着威爾。（未完）</p>

<p>Expresses Gratitude to He Yingqin via Letter</p>
<p>Rumors Say Remnants to Be Reduced to Nine Regiments</p>
<p>Fu Zhan Kui Returns to Beiping to Report to He on Sun's Departure from the Army</p>
<p>Fu, Wang, Zhao, and Others Go to Dengkou to Discuss Aftermath with Sun's Generals</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Sun Dianying, accompanied by more than ten followers, arrived in Taiyuan this morning from Datong by car. They reached the Taiyuan station at around 5 PM this afternoon. Xu Yongchang and others all sent representatives to welcome them. Sun lodged at Lu Fengnian’s residence, refusing to see reporters. His whereabouts and everything else remain unknown. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Sun Dianying, feeling unwell, disembarked at Datong on the 28th and transferred to Shanxi Province for recuperation. Chairman He specially telegraphed Director Yan and others, requesting local military and police to provide adequate protection. The original telegram read: To Director Yan Baichuan, Chairman Xu Ci Chen, [and] Xun Jian of Taiyuan: I have just received a telegram from Councilor Fu Zhan Kui stating that he accompanied Sun Dianying to Datong yesterday. Sun, feeling unwell, immediately changed his route to Shanxi Province to recuperate quietly. Please instruct the military and police in the areas he passes through to provide adequate protection. Brother He Yingqin, respectfully. (28th) Printed. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zhan Kui returned to Beiping this afternoon to talk. I left Beiping on the 28th of last month and arrived at Li Gang Fort on the 4th of this month. Soon, Sun Dianying arrived to meet me. I asked him what his plans were. Sun replied, "I have nothing else to say, I will follow you." I spent five days with Sun in Li Gang Fort, discussing methods for leaving the army. Sun sold a residence in Beiping for 27,000 yuan, which was used to pay off the accompanying officers. I left Li Gang Fort on the 16th and returned east, arriving in Dengkou on the 18th. On the 19th, I received a telegram from Sun, instructing me to wait to travel together. On the 22nd, Sun led more than ten trusted confidants to Dengkou and set off together. We met with Fu Zuoyi and others at Linhe. Because many of Sun's family members remained in Baotou and needed arranging, on the evening of the 25th, we took the PingSui Railway train east together. When Sun went from Shizuizi to Dengkou, he walked and wept along the way, his appearance was quite miserable. Sun originally planned to go directly to Beiping and transfer to Tianjin, but Yan Xishan telegraphed an invitation to go to Taiyuan for a discussion. When the train passed Datong, Yan sent Yang Ai Yuan to greet him, and Sun temporarily got off with his family and transferred to a car to go to Taiyuan. Because my mission to persuade Sun to leave the army was complete, I returned to Beiping to report everything to He. Sun's residence is his own choice. However, Sun will not stay long in Taiyuan. He will come to Beiping as soon as he has properly settled his family. Sun sent Secretary-General Liu Zenglu with a handwritten letter to come with me to Beiping to meet with He and express his gratitude. The authorities have agreed to find a way to provide Sun with living expenses, so there is no problem. Regarding the aftermath of Sun's departure from the army, since I was only responsible for persuading Sun, I did not ask about it in detail. The details are unknown. Liu Zenglu is carrying two handwritten letters from Sun, one to He and the other to Hu Yukun, Ji Yiqiao, and Pang Bingxun. The content of the letters mainly expresses gratitude for their good intentions and expresses the hope that they will love the house and its crow regarding the aftermath of the army and make appropriate arrangements. Liu will visit He on the 29th and visit all parties and plans to stay in Beiping for three days before returning to Taiyuan to report on his mission. Since Sun has left the army, his trusted officers are also seeking to leave. When Fu and Sun boarded the train from Baotou, many people asked to accompany them. Later, Fu negotiated with the railway bureau to add a third-class passenger car for free use. The officers then took their families in Baotou and traveled to Beiping. They will each return to their hometowns within the day. Hu Jie San spoke, concerning the aftermath of the 41st Army, it is rumored that it will be reduced to four regiments by the Ningxia side and five regiments by the Jin Sui side, for a total of nine regiments. The rest will be given funds for dismissal. The authorities here are currently telegraphing Jiang for instructions, and it can be implemented as soon as a reply is received. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin received a telegram from Fu Zuoyi this afternoon stating that Sun disembarked at Datong and transferred by car to Taiyuan at Yan's invitation to discuss everything. All units of Sun's army are currently being reorganized. Liu Yueting's unit west of Shizuizi is being supervised and reorganized by the Ningxia army, while Ding Futing and Lu Fengnian's units east of Dengkou are being reorganized by the Jin Sui army. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui telegraphed Beiping, saying that the first step in the aftermath in Ningxia will be to deal with urgent relief, and the second step will be to handle demobilization. Ma will come to Beiping to handle everything after the demobilization. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin stated that Sun Dianying's compliance with the order to leave the army this time and the settling of the Ningxia issue are truly fortunate for the country and the people. The authorities will be lenient towards Sun's past and will not pursue the matter. If Sun comes to Beiping, his life and property will be guaranteed. The generals of the 41st Army also deeply understand the righteousness and obey the reorganization. The authorities can treat their lives and property in the same way as Sun. After Sun left the army and arrived in Dengkou, he handed over the command of his troops to the responsible division and brigade commanders to await reorganization. Since he has already left Beiping, he will not interfere with the aftermath of the troops. Currently, the Ding Brigade is joining Ningxia, and the Liu and Lu units are gathering near Dengkou. Liu and others are also in Dengkou. Jin Sui telegraphed that generals Fu, Wang, Zhao, and others are also going from Sansheng Palace to Dengkou to confer with Sun's generals on the aftermath. Staff officers Tao Jun, Li Ming, Zhang Xuanze, and Wang Zhongquan, who were sent by the Military Council, are also staying in Dengkou. The personnel and family members of Sun's troops who stayed in Baotou have been sent back to their hometowns by the Sui side. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Guihua Telegram, Sun Dianying and Fu Zhan Kui passed through Sui on the evening of the 27th at 7 PM. Sun said that he would decide whether to go to Beiping or Taiyuan after passing through Datong. He did not want to ask about the aftermath of his troops because he had already left the army, but he was quite uneasy about owing the people a large sum of money. Fu said that the people in western Sui are suffering and urgently need relief. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guihua: Sun Dianying and Fu Zhan Kui passed through Sui at the time of Shen (3-5 PM) on the 27th. Feng Lou, Yuan Qingzeng and others went to the station to welcome and see them off. A reporter asked Sun about the aftermath of his troops. Sun replied, "Since I have left the army, I do not wish to hear about anything in the army. However, I owe the people a large sum of money from my military campaign in western Sui, and I cannot repay the debt. I am very uneasy, and I have nothing else to say." Fu said that Sun resolutely left the army, and the great war in the Northwest was fortunately concluded. All the aftermath is being handled, and it is expected that there will be no complications. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guihua: The Yellow River between Linhe and Dengkou has thawed, and the canals are overflowing, making travel extremely difficult. The people of Wuyuan and Linhe have suffered greatly after the war and are desperately in need of food and relief. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Linhe 28th Telegram: The canals between Linhe and Sansheng Palace are flooded, and all roads have been destroyed. Fu Zuoyi had to take a detour on horseback but could not pass and has now returned to Linhe. Regarding the disarmament of Sun Dianying's remaining troops, Wang Jingguo is stationed in Sansheng Palace to handle it. A number of prisoners have already been captured. Personnel dispatched from here are to escort them to the rear for dispersal. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e5">Thoughts on the New Life Movement <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The New Life Movement reverses the old life into a machine. Doctors are craftsmen who repair the human body. Those who use qi transformation are the best, followed by acupuncture, followed by medicine. Only as a last resort is surgery used. It is also like repairing a machine: wiping away dirt and grime is enough to restore normal function. Why bother to use saws and axes to reconstruct? I am devoting all my efforts to promoting ancient Chinese An-Dao techniques, which are also a part of the New Life Movement. Using qi to attack qi, using blood to attack blood, pressing acupoints to guide stagnation, allowing qi to move blood. Blood cannot move on its own without qi. Qi, which in science is the human body's electricity, may be considered mysterious and unfounded, but it does not know that in using the old to speak of the new, everything must not forget its roots. Techniques can be based on the old to advance to the new principles. How can one speak of the new without the old? Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are the four pillars of a country. If the four pillars are not promoted, the country will perish. Great is the advocacy of the New Life Movement. (Zhengdao Resident, No. 296 Avenue Joffre) An-Dao treats illness with extremely rapid response. Occasional acute illnesses or slow illnesses turning acute are effective after one session. Long-term chronic ailments can be cured in a matter of days. Terminal illnesses can be predicted for their critical period, and questionable illnesses can be accurately examined for their source.

<h3 id="e19">The Cause and Effect of the US Democratic Party's Abandonment of the Philippine Islands 　Heng <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Of recent international events, two are most worthy of world attention. (1) The exchange of notes between the US and Japan. (2) The United States' permission for the Philippine Islands to become independent. The reason is that these two actions by the United States have a great impact on the situation in the Pacific. However, the former issue has already been discussed in detail in this newspaper and can be temporarily set aside. Here, the cause and effect of the latter issue will be presented. The US abandonment of the Philippine Islands does not seem to be related to our country in reality. At the same time, it is not completely without room for maneuver. We do not need to pay too much attention to it. However, in order to carefully examine the international situation, seize opportunities, and take advantage of the situation to ensure our territorial sovereignty, we must not ignore it.</p>
<p>The question of Philippine independence has been unresolved in the United States for more than thirty years. When it was transferred from Spanish hands to the US territory, the two major political parties in the US already had differing opinions. The Republican Party believed that if the Philippine Islands were under US control, it could be freed from Spanish tyranny and obtained by other powers. In fact, its intention was to strengthen the position of the United States in the Far East and curb the powers' coveting of China at that time. John Hay's Open Door Policy of equal opportunity was established after the US Republican government acquired the Philippine Islands. As for the policy of the Democratic Party, it was different. Therefore, when the US Navy attacked and captured the Philippine Islands, the Democratic Party not only did not take pride in it, but also denounced it as an "act of imperialism." When the Philippine Islands were officially ceded, the Democratic Party advocated making it independent. It believed that the US capture of the Philippine Islands was to save the Filipinos from misery, so it should not be taken as its own. If it were, it would be replacing violence with violence, which would be contrary to the original intention. There were deep reasons why the Democratic Party was so generous at that time. One thing that can be briefly mentioned is that since the North-South War, political power has often been in the hands of the Republican Party. At that time, American industry was developing rapidly and urgently needed to expand outward. The Republican Party, which was often in power, represented the interests of big industrialists and vigorously sought to expand its power in the East. The seizure of Pacific islands was all achieved during this period. However, it did not pay much attention to domestic affairs and often obstructed the revival of the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party was devastated during the North-South War and oppressed after the North-South War. It had been in opposition for a long time and had experienced many setbacks. The combination of these two factors led to its policy focusing on improving domestic affairs and ignoring the expansion of foreign power. It also said that the more victories and captures the ruling party had abroad, the more oppressive it would be at home. As a result, the Democratic Party's consistent policy of abandoning the Philippine Islands for the past thirty years was formed.</p>
<p>Commentators often say that the way of diplomacy is constantly changing and only looks at profit. However, this statement is only a superficial view. Taking the US abandonment of the Philippine Islands as an example, there are many reasons for it. In simple terms, first, it is the traditional policy of the party. Second, it is the economic reason. Third, it is the racial reason. Fourth, it is the deep fear of triggering a war between Japan and the United States. Let's talk about them separately.</p>
<p>It is obvious that we regard the US permission for the Philippine Islands to become independent as an action of the Democratic Party. First, the Democratic Party has always opposed the cession of the Philippine Islands from beginning to end. Second, every time a Democratic president is elected or the number of congressional seats increases, a Philippine independence bill is proposed. For example, in the past thirty years, there have been two periods when the US Democratic Party was in power. One was the Wilson era, and the other was the recent Roosevelt era. The Philippine independence bill could be passed without hindrance only during these two periods. Outside of these periods, even if there were proposals, it would be difficult to pass them. In total, the US Congress passed three Philippine independence bills during these two periods. (1) The Jones Act of Philippine Independence in 1916, which allowed the Philippine Islands to become independent once it had a strong government. It was approved by Wilson. When Wilson retired in 1920, he gave a farewell speech to Congress, recognizing that the time for Philippine independence had matured and urging immediate fulfillment of the promise. (2) The Hawes-Cutting Act at the end of 1932. At that time, the Democratic Party had a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives due to the 1930 elections, so it could be passed smoothly. Although the Democratic Party had won the presidential election at that time, President Hoover was still in office, so it was vetoed by Hoover. However, Congress had already fallen into the hands of the Democratic Party, and the president was powerless. Therefore, this bill finally became law. (3) Because the Philippine Congress opposed the Hawes-Cutting Act, Roosevelt asked both houses to reconsider it, and the Tydings-McDuffie Act of today was passed. The reason why this bill could be passed smoothly should be the power of the Democratic Party. We can see the partisan division in the US Congress today, and there is no need to doubt it. The Democratic Party actually occupies 313 seats out of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives. The Republican Party only occupies 117 seats. The Democratic Party actually occupies 60 seats out of the 96 seats in the Senate. The Republican Party only occupies 35 seats. The Democratic Party occupies such a large majority in Congress, and it can do everything freely. Therefore, the US permission for the Philippine Islands to become independent today is actually a manifestation of the US Democratic Party's implementation of its traditional policy and cannot be regarded as an action specifically to avoid Far Eastern disputes.</p>
<p>However, this matter was not only promoted by the traditional policy of one party, but also by economic, racial, and other reasons. If the Philippine Islands are not independent, their sugar and other products imported into the US will not be subject to import taxes, which will affect the business of sugar manufacturers in their own country. At the same time, if the Philippine Islands are not independent, Filipinos entering the US will not be restricted like other Asians, which may also affect the lives of American workers. Moreover, the Philippine Islands are 3,000 nautical miles from Honolulu and more than 5,000 nautical miles from San Francisco. It is too prominent and a major weakness in national defense. Therefore, commentators often say that the US ownership of the Philippine Islands is not only insufficient to enhance the US position in the Far East, but also enough to reveal its strategic shortcomings. If Japan provokes the US and attacks this weakness, the US will not be able to avoid war with Japan today. In addition, the coastline of the Philippines is more than 11,000 miles long, and the construction of fortresses, naval ports, and defense projects is extremely costly. At the Washington Conference in 1922, the reason why the US made concessions to Japan and stopped the construction of defense projects on the Philippine Islands was because the expenditure was too great. With the current economic decline of the United States, it is wise to abandon the Philippine Islands. Therefore, the US action on the Philippine Islands this time can also be regarded as a strategic retreat in advance and even as an expression of not wanting to go to war with Japan.</p>
<p>The above are all the reasons for the US abandonment of the Philippine Islands. Except for the last one, it can be said that it has little relationship with the Sino-Japanese problem in the Far Eastern incident. However, the impact is actually not completely unrelated. First, this action by the United States can somewhat reduce its prestige in the Far East and increase Japan's arrogance in doing whatever it wants. However, it is an exaggeration to say that Japan will have no constraints from now on. First, the 12-year period gives the US plenty of room for maneuver. Second, at the next Pacific Conference, the US, Russia, France, the Netherlands, and other countries may not support the US to ensure the neutrality of the Philippine Islands or even restrict Japan's actions in the Far East. Third, if the Pacific Conference fails, the US will still have ample time to prepare for sanctions against Japan. Fourth, the US House of Representatives is re-elected every two years, the Senate is re-elected one-third every two years, and the President is re-elected every four years. Therefore, the Republican Party has plenty of opportunities to regain power within 12 years. Therefore, whether the Philippine Islands can become independent within 12 years and whether the US Army and Navy can withdraw completely within the stipulated period are all unknown questions. Therefore, the people of the country do not need to worry too much about the US expression of abandoning the Philippine Islands today. What is needed is that we should have extremely careful and thorough preparations at the next Pacific Conference.</p>
<h3 id="e20">US Naval Bill Passed by Congress and Approved by the President Becomes Law <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Only Building Ships Within the Scope of the Treaty</p>
<p>Roosevelt Hopes for International Disarmament</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently signed the Vinson Naval Bill, which stipulates the construction of 102 ships to the extent permitted by the naval treaty, and 1,184 aircraft. After being passed by the House of Representatives, the Senate added two amendments requiring that the profits obtained by private contractors for shipbuilding projects should not exceed 10%, and that one-quarter of the more than 1,000 aircraft should be built by the government itself. However, this was rejected by the House of Representatives. The Senate finally passed the original bill of the House of Representatives. Today, Roosevelt also signed a note explaining that the Vinson Law only allows shipbuilding in principle. As for the actual construction, it depends on the availability of funds. The President also said that he supports new naval reductions at the 1935 Naval Conference. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt, in a letter attached to the Vinson Naval Bill, explained that this bill only allows the construction of the US Navy within the scope of the treaty, rather than building more warships. The authorities still take the policy of supporting continued reductions in naval armaments. The President also stated, "I hope that the naval conference to be held in 1935 can extend the existing restrictions and agree to greater reductions." It is reported that the Vinson Naval Proposal stipulates an expenditure of 500 million yuan for the construction of warships and aircraft. It was passed by the Senate on March 6, with some amendments attached, and then sent to the House of Representatives for reconsideration. However, the House of Representatives rejected the amendments. This bill is now returned to the Senate in order to reconcile the differences between the two houses. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The contents of the warship construction bill signed by the President today are as follows: (1) Total expenditure of 500 million yuan to 750 million yuan. (2) Period of seven years. (3) Types and numbers of warships to be built: 66 destroyers, 32 submarines, 4 cruisers, 1,140 aircraft. (4) Construction expenditure must be approved by the Budget Bureau. (Dentsu dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has signed the Vinson Naval Bill today, and the United States can build two light cruisers, totaling 17,100 tons, one aircraft carrier of 15,000 tons, and several submarines, totaling 36,590 tons. The first to be built are 12 torpedo boats and 6 submarines. In addition, the regular budget stipulates the construction of one battlecruiser and three light cruisers, and funds are allocated from the public works expenditure item to build two aircraft carriers, one battlecruiser, three light cruisers, four submarines, twenty torpedo boats, and two gunboats.

<p>US Does Not Abandon Position Operated for Forty Years</p>
<p>Japan Prepares for Military Action on the Asian Continent</p>
<p>(Moscow) Pravda commented on the exchange of notes between Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota and US Secretary of State Hull. The newspaper pointed out that the Japanese press generally regarded this exchange of notes as "Hirota's victory" and said that Hirota had repeatedly stated that he would try to improve US-Japan relations in order to alleviate the political isolation in the external world after his invasion of China. "Japan is trying to neutralize one side of the front line (that is, the United States) so that it can feel at ease and further occupy the Asian continent. At the same time, in order to 'restore the traditional friendship between Japan and the United States,' it proposed that the United States recognize 'Manchukuo,' allow China to withdraw from the League of Nations, and the United States abolish the Japanese Immigration Law. The most requested thing is the equality of the land and sea military strength of the two countries. Japan also believes that it is necessary for the world to recognize it as a strong country to stabilize 'the East,' that is to say, what Tokyo thinks is right cannot be hindered by others. On the Japanese side, it has tried its best to express its willingness to conclude an arbitration treaty with the United States, establish neutral zones in the Pacific, and recognize the inviolability of the 'Open Door' principle. However, as the experience of Manchuria proves, these doors have been occupied by the Japanese, and even good American capitalists have not been able to enter." The newspaper further stated, "It is natural for Tokyo to prepare to negotiate with the United States at the above-mentioned price. Japanese imperialism obviously wants to rely on Hirota's letter to Hull to discover what it can hope for and what it needs to fear. As for the United States, which has been painstakingly managing to consolidate its position in the Pacific for forty years, how can it give up what Tokyo wants without bloodshed? Japan's diplomatic activities can only show the increasingly sharp imperialist conflicts in the Pacific and the enthusiastic work carried out by the Japanese diplomatic community to prepare for military action on the Asian continent."

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota intends to fully mobilize the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and overseas envoys, and Japan intends to automatically launch activities to major countries. Starting with the order for Ambassador Saito to the United States to return to China in May, other formal and informal requests, such as Ambassador Matsudaira to the United Kingdom, Ambassador Sato to France, Ambassador Ota to Russia, Ambassador Mushanokoji to Turkey, and Minister Arima to China, will be allowed to return to China at appropriate times.

<p>India Raises Tariffs on Cotton Textiles</p>
<p>(London) Hamansley, a Conservative MP who once served as Chancellor of the Exchequer, criticized the Hong Kong authorities in the House of Commons today for using excessive amounts of Japanese water cement in public buildings. He said that although the Governor of Hong Kong had guaranteed that British water cement would be purchased as much as possible, in fact, among the 42 public buildings in Hong Kong, 30 used Japanese cement, the local product was used in a certain number of structures and the hybrid variant in two. The Colonial Secretary replied that, in general, colonial governments are willing to use British goods as much as possible. As for the matters questioned by Mr. Havas, he did not know, but promised to investigate. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Osaka) The tariff on cotton interlock fabric is as high as twelve annas per pound. The telegram from the Japan-India Association has given a great shock to the parties concerned. It is found that most of the interlock fabrics currently exported to India weigh one and a half to three and a half pounds per dozen, and the tariff in Bombay is 24 annas, which is equivalent to 18% ad valorem. Therefore, there is no other way to completely eliminate Japan's interlock fabric exports to India.

<p>(Beijing) French Foreign Minister Barthou met with Foreign Minister Hymen today to jointly study the European situation. They all recognized that Germany's restoration of military equipment is indeed dangerous. Once other countries follow suit and compete to increase military equipment, its impact will be extremely significant. Barthou and Hymen both expressed concern about this and believed that the best way to prevent this disaster is to conclude an international convention stipulating reliable guarantee methods. Barthou then met with King Leopold III, and after the meeting, Barthou came out and made a statement, saying that the King was familiar with diplomatic issues and that he admired him very much. The close relationship between Belgium and France could not be resolved by anything, nor could it be relaxed. His visit to Belgium this time further showed the necessity of the relationship between the two countries. Barthou then mentioned the issue of security in the disarmament convention, saying that France is still conducting informal negotiations with the British government and has not yet received a reply. "We are now waiting for a reply from the British government. If the British government raises questions, we should answer them in terms of our duties and will." (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>

Since then, France could no longer regard Poland as an ally that only added to the burden. The Warsaw Evening News said, "We firmly believe that although armed conflict between Poland and Germany can be avoided temporarily, Germany's eastern policy cannot be abandoned after all, just as it cannot forget Alsace and Lorraine (formerly belonging to Germany, returned to France after the European War). Poland and France have their mutual interests, so the two republics should have a very close relationship in politics and military affairs, which cannot be destroyed by any German conspiracy.

<p>A tendency to establish partial agreements</p>
<p>The General Commission on Disarmament will postpone its meeting</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday, the Cabinet Committee on Disarmament met to study the French government's reply of March 17 regarding the disarmament issue. It was believed that the French government intended to divide security measures into two types: one for the implementation of future disarmament conventions and the other for general security. As reported in yesterday's telegram, French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, verbally explained to Foreign Secretary Simon the interpretation of the security measures for the implementation of the disarmament convention mentioned in the French reply of March 17. Further exchange of views will follow. While British officials are not overly optimistic about this matter, they believe there are satisfactory reasons. In any case, Foreign Secretary Simon will report the information he has obtained to the Cabinet meeting tomorrow. He will likely meet with Henderson, the chairman of the Disarmament Conference, immediately. The meeting of the Bureau's minority committee, originally scheduled for April 10, may also be postponed. Before the Cabinet meeting, influential opinions are divided into two factions: one advocates that Britain and France discuss security measures for the implementation of the disarmament convention, and the other believes that after the Disarmament Conference loses credibility and issues a declaration, they should be pragmatic and quickly strengthen national defense. Currently, the first faction still prevails, but if current efforts still fail, the second faction's opinion will inevitably gain the upper hand. The current efforts seem to be trending towards the establishment of partial agreements, as reported by this newspaper yesterday. That is, if security measures for the implementation of the disarmament convention cannot be made effective worldwide, an agreement should be established only for Britain and its closest neighbors, and less coercive measures should be adopted for countries outside this scope. The reason for this trend is the strong attitude of the United States. When criticizing France in its reply to Britain on disarmament, the US President stated that if international issues are discussed and consultation conventions are concluded, the United States is willing to participate, but if it is forced to use force to resolve any international disputes, the United States cannot recognize it. Amidst the divergent opinions of various factions, we have discovered a thought, that is, the British generally believe that the current issue is related to the security of Britain itself. British people currently regard the air force led by German Aviation Minister Göring as equivalent to the armored ships commanded by Admiral Tirpitz of the German Navy before the European War. Therefore, the current hope of the British people is to protect national security at the lowest cost and avoid all dangers. Understanding this, we can easily understand why Britain's opinion on the disarmament issue may change but also faces difficulties. (Havas News Agency, 27th)</p>

<p>(London) According to sources here, the negotiations between Britain and France on national security may have significant developments since British Ambassador to France, Corbin, spoke with British Foreign Secretary Simon last night. It is said that Lord John had previously asked Ambassador Corbin to present three special questions regarding this matter to the French government, and the French response to these questions was conveyed by Ambassador Corbin to Lord John last night. The three questions are listed in order as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In the event of a dispute between the two countries, will France provide an executive guarantee or an ordinary guarantee? These are two different types of facts. According to Ambassador Corbin, France has recognized the theoretical difference between an executive guarantee and an ordinary guarantee, but in practice, it does not make this distinction, because once a treaty is violated, it will inevitably involve force. At this time, it is important to show that our treaty countries approve of the executive guarantee and the ordinary guarantee.</p>
<p>(2) If France has determined the difference between an executive guarantee and an ordinary guarantee, then what kind of guarantee does France want in two different situations? According to Ambassador Corbin, France's response to this point was very tactful and questioned what kind of guarantee Britain was willing to offer.</p>
<p>(3) Does France want a territorial guarantee system or an ordinary guarantee system?</p>
<p>According to Ambassador Corbin, France agrees to a territorial guarantee agreement, and France may even question what scope of agreement Britain is willing to suggest. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>Friedrichshafen, Germany Today, the construction details of Germany's new passenger airship, named "LZ129" (Airship 129), were announced by the Zeppelin factory authorities. The airship is expected to be completed this summer. All the equipment inside is larger than the original "Graf Zeppelin". The "Graf Zeppelin" airship has one passenger cabin, two dining rooms, and several bedrooms, accommodating 24 passengers. The newly built "Airship 129" has two passenger cabins and dining rooms, 25 bedrooms, and can accommodate 50 beds. The total indoor area available for passengers has increased by at least four and a half times. Each room is divided into a dining room, writing room, reading room, and smoking room, and smoking will especially be welcomed by passengers in the future, because passengers on the "Graf Zeppelin" were prohibited from smoking. The equipment used in this ship is of the Diesel type, with a total power of 4,400 horsepower, and it uses heavy oil as fuel, so the risk of fire is unlikely to occur. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>Abolishing the System of Holding Concurrent Positions</p>
<p>Eighty Thousand Civil Servants Retire</p>
<p>(Paris) Following the Nanjing method, the French government decided today to abolish the system of holding concurrent positions, and decided to order 80,000 civil servants to retire and no longer supplement them. It is expected that a clear order will be issued within a few days. According to reliable sources, government salaries are about to be reduced, and it is estimated that this method can save 500 million francs, because the government urgently needs 4 billion francs to balance its budget. Although the system of holding concurrent positions has not been completely abolished in Nanjing, it is expected that the French government will resolutely implement its new resolution even if it encounters resistance from those involved. Some parties say that salary reductions and layoffs may cause disturbances, but the government seems to have prepared everything, and party leaders everywhere have also adopted measures to maintain public security and order. Prime Minister Doumergue's position is currently very stable. The National Veterans Federation, which has 3 million members, has decided to participate in national political life and support the Prime Minister. Veterans are very powerful. With the Prime Minister's assistance, he can prevent the occurrence of new disturbances. The government's decision to lay off staff will naturally cause fierce verbal battles in the Chamber of Deputies. If Doumergue's plan to balance the budget fails, then another change in the French government is inevitable. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<p>The House of Representatives Votes to Maintain the Original Proposal</p>
<p>The Fate of this Bill Depends on the Senate</p>
<p>(Washington) The bill to increase the amount of veteran support and subsidies had been passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives successively, but the President strongly opposed it and applied the veto power, sending the original bill back to Congress and refusing to promulgate it, and explaining the reasons for his veto in a message. After receiving the President's message, the House of Representatives again submitted the original bill for a vote. As a result, those who advocated maintaining the original bill and opposed the President's veto reached 301 votes, including 200 Democrats, 97 Republicans, and 4 Farmer-Labor Party members, which reached more than the legally required two-thirds majority. If the Senate also adopts the same attitude, the President's veto will be invalid. However, the situation in the Senate is currently unknown. In his message to Congress on this matter, Roosevelt vigorously stated that raising the salaries of officials by another level is, in his view, a matter of principle, not only related to government expenditures. When the country is engaged in economic recovery, he hopes that Congress can continue to cooperate with him. At present, there is more than one end that needs extraordinary expenditure. For example, agriculture needs relief, and farmers and owners have debts that cannot be repaid, and the government must have a way to help them. Millions of unemployed people must be given work. These are all unexpected burdens on the national treasury. Since expenditures increase, other government expenditures must be saved. This is a natural principle. The President also said that he expressed his sympathy for the officials, but the plight of millions of unemployed people is far more pitiful than that of the officials. In addition, there are injured veterans and those who are healthy. During service, there are those with upright conduct and those with misconduct. In principle, they should be distinguished, but Congress treats them equally and gives them all the right to enjoy support, which is completely unacceptable. (Havas News Agency, 27th)</p>

The public believes that the entire steel industry will follow the story of the McKinley Steel Company and increase the wages of workers to stabilize the workers' hearts. Although Federal Transportation Regulator Isven has not yet issued a declaration recently, he is still working hard today to mediate the dispute over wage cuts in the railway industry. In the flour mills in Cleveland, riots and strikes occur at the same time, and many workers have been arrested. A strike of 3,200 workers also occurred at the New York Shipbuilding Company in New Jersey. It is said that the strike was caused by opposition to the company's manipulation of labor unions and wages. Two cruisers and four destroyers being built by the US Navy have been forced to stop work as a result. In addition, 2,000 workers in an aircraft factory also went on strike demanding wage increases. The wave of strikes in the automobile industry has entered a peaceful area, because the dove of peace has come to Detroit and other automobile manufacturing centers. President Roosevelt's arbitration committee began mediating the labor unrest in the West Coast Wolf Blood Gate in San Francisco today. It is said that if the Wolf Blood Gate labor unrest is realized, the US Pacific shipping industry will be severely affected. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e50">Jiangnan Railway Company Contracts to Build the Kyoto Zhao Railway <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Construction Cost is Approximately 30 Million</p>
<p>The Project is Carried Out in Five Sections</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to expand its railway business and connect the seven southeastern provinces, the Jiangnan Railway Company presented to and was approved by the Ministry of Railways to contract to build the Kyoto Zhao Railway, which starts from Nanjing and reaches Zhao'an on the border of Fujian and Guangdong. The entire route is about 1,200 kilometers long, passing through the five provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, crossing important mountains such as Huangshan, Tiantai, and Dayu. The construction is larger and more difficult than the Wuzha Railway. Its position in transportation is all the more necessary due to the difficulty of the construction. The interior of the five southeastern provinces is mostly mountainous, relying only on bamboo rafts traveling on rivers and streams. Products have no way to be transported out, and languages and cultures are mostly isolated. Now that it is connected, its benefits are several times greater than the Wuzha Railway. The estimated construction cost is 30 million yuan. The project is planned by Hong Shentong, the chief engineer of the Wuzha Railway. The entire route is divided into five sections for construction and five construction periods, namely (1) the Kyoto Wu section, (2) the Wu Sun section (Sunjiahe), (3) the Sun Jiang section (Jiangshan, Zhejiang), (4) the Jiang Yan section (Yanping, Fujian), and (5) the Yan Zhao section. After reaching Zhao'an, it is planned to extend the route to Guangzhou to realize the transportation plan for the five southeastern provinces. However, the subgrade of the second section between Wuhu and Sunjiabu will use the track currently built by the Wuzha Railway, so the construction of the second section can be saved. Only the four sections of Kyoto Wu and others are built on the entire route. The funding for the first phase of the project has been remitted from Shanghai, and construction will begin within five days. The original automobile route between Kyoto and Wu runs along the south bank of the Yangtze River, and is too curved and unsuitable for transportation. A new road will be built instead. The surveying team personnel are transferred from the Wuzha Railway and sent to the road for surveying, led by Survey Team Leader Wang. The Kyoto Wu section is mostly plains, making construction very easy. Among them, the Dahe River in Dangtu County will be connected by a three-hole iron bridge. It is expected to be completed and open to traffic by the end of June this year. Regarding the subgrade between Sunjiabu and Jiangshan, after passing Tunxi, it must pass through the mountains. Liu Yiyan, the director of the Anhui Construction Department, once served as the director of the Hangzhou-Jiangxi Railway Bureau and is familiar with the terrain of southern Zhejiang. He was recruited by Zhang Jingjiang, the general manager of the Jiangnan Railway Company, and arrived in Kyoto a few days ago to discuss everything. Sun Qiming and Xia Quanshou, two technicians sent by the Ministry of Railways to survey and verify the road work, have completed the survey and verification of the Wuwan section of the Wuzha Railway and are continuing to investigate in Xuancheng. Once the Kyowu section of the Kyosho Road is completed, the Ministry of Railways will handle joint transportation with the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Road and the Kyoto-Tianjin Road in order to facilitate transportation. The Huainan Railway on the north bank of the Yangtze River is sponsored by the Central Construction Committee, starting from the Luhe coal mine in Bengbu, west to Huaiyuan County, and reaching Yuxikou on the opposite bank of Wubu. The work has begun, and it is expected that Wuhu will become a water and land transportation center. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>(Zhenjiang) Gu Renfa issued the following statement regarding the arrest of Li Shuyun: "While I was on official business in Jiangxi, an incident of resisting the surrender occurred at the Second Branch Bureau of the Wuxi Public Security Bureau. As a result, my wife Li Shuyun and her daughter were arrested. I am concerned that various sectors of society may not understand the truth, so I will briefly explain the process. In the spring of the 20th year of the Republic, I returned to my hometown to visit relatives. Due to disagreements with my previous wife Yun, we divorced through the mediation of relatives. Several months later, I remarried Li Shuyun. This time, while I was away on official business, she dared to go to Wuxi privately and instigated Liu Zhuomin to resist the surrender. Furthermore, according to reports from various parties, her mother and daughter have been using false names in Changsha to swindle money and engage in various illegal activities. Recently, the Wuxi Public Security Bureau found forged seals of my personal stamp in the suitcase of Liu's wife Li Rongzhen, which were stamped on the lower left corner of the official stationery used by the provincial government and provincial residence. The circumstances are particularly serious. I am inherently cautious and have been appointed to lead civil affairs, entrusted by the government and recognized by the chairman. I always strive to rectify discipline and eliminate corruption. Now that the Wuxi incident has revealed that my wife Shuyun is the main culprit, along with her various illegal activities, damaging personal reputation is a minor matter, but undermining national discipline is a major matter. At a time when we are vigorously promoting propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame and transforming customs, if the national law cannot be enforced among relatives, how can we rectify official norms and set an example for our colleagues? Such incidents are very common in our country's ancient and modern rule-of-law countries, where the law is valued over personal feelings. The media should be at the forefront of safeguarding the rule of law and provide accurate guidance. However, I am responsible for failing to manage my family properly and for misusing personnel and should request punishment to clarify my responsibility. As for Shuyun and her mother's actions of biting back in desperation and falsely accusing me of bigamy, this is a personal matter and has its own proper channels for resolution, and it is not related to the rectification of discipline by the government.

<h3 id="e95">Another Report on British Encroachment on Ban Hong <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>| Heaven-Given Treasures Have Already Been Exploited |</p>
<p>Beijing News: Regarding the British encroachment on the Ban Hong incident, the Yunnan Association in Beijing, in addition to petitioning the central government to negotiate with the British side through the government, has also established the Yunnan-Burma Border Demarcation Promotion Committee to study the border issue, hoping to contribute to and urge the government to reclaim sovereignty. Recently, the association has learned from reports from people in Ban Hong that although there are many records of the British military occupation of Ban Hong and the mining situation, there are still many omissions. The reports are more detailed and are recorded to provide references for those who are concerned. According to reports, British encroachment on Ban Hong has become a serious issue of unanimous concern throughout the country. However, the Ban Neng mentioned by the British side is very far from Ban Hong and cannot be discussed together. An on-site survey would make it clear. There was originally a large-scale silver factory there, which the British had coveted for a long time. This time, they occupied the mine by force, which was also expected. From Man E to Huiqin River, that is, the border between Yunnan and Burma, there are stone pillars, but the numbers are unclear. This stone pillar was originally in the Hubu boundary, 60 li away from here, and was secretly moved in by someone. From Hongyantou to Maliba Keyu City, it was occupied by the British in the 20th year of Guangxu and opened as a commercial port. The British changed it to Gogan County and appointed the old Yang Tusi as the county magistrate, which shows their deep intentions. The British also have postal, telegraph, school, church, and agency organs. Turning down to Xiushui Village, that is, the undetermined boundary, crossing the lower reaches of the Nanding River, to Gongmeng, from Menggang to Ban Hong, there are large bamboo forests and giant trees along the way, and silver factories, with Muslim natives interspersed. To Ban Neng, there are many metal mines, especially rich in silver mines. The natives used indigenous methods and Islam to mine them, which was quite effective. The British often used coercion and enticement to cause disputes between the natives and Muslims in order to profit from them. Fortunately, Muslim intellectuals stood up to mediate, and there was no fierce battle. However, after the turmoil, many natives avoided the chaos elsewhere. The British then implemented their colonial policy, making the natives mutually guarantee each other. For each household that came, they allocated a piece of land according to the number of people, loaned them 100 yuan, one cow, and one stone of grain, and ordered them to build thatched huts next to the fields for farming. As a result, 2,000 households were moved away. Passing through Pachang Mountain from Ban Neng, entering Gongmeng, and heading south, it is the savage land of Kun, located between the Gun, Lu, Nan, and Ban Rivers, shaped like a gourd, so it is also called the Gourd King Land, with five small tribes, each with a native king, with Nangun River Gongming Mountain as the gateway, about 900 li vertically and more than 2,000 li horizontally, with more than 20,000 households and more than 100,000 people. The territory is rich in minerals and products and is our southwest barrier. During the Qing Dynasty, Gong Ling once went to its territory, but since the traffic was blocked, no one has taken care of it since the Republic of China. The British then developed the ambition to invade, such as repairing roads, lending silver coins and cloth to the natives, or renting cattle and horses and distributing salt. Fortunately, the workers still know that there are Chinese and have not been completely occupied. To the west, crossing the Gunlu River from Mengyu to Mengwan, Mengying, Mengliang, Mengjie, and Mengyang, about 300 li, there is barren grass and smoke, sparsely populated. Arriving at Lashio, that is, the end of the British Burmese Railway, the British have opened it as a commercial port, where people from all over the world are mixed. There are many overseas Chinese from Guangdong and Sichuan and Yunnan. There are overseas Chinese schools and branches of the Chinese Nationalist Party. To Banghai and Nandulao Silver Factory, which was originally mined by the Chinese, it fell to the British in the 12th year of Guangxu. Now there is a railway directly to the mine, producing 2,000 tons of silver ore every day, which can refine 120 tons of silver and 800 tons of lead, with more than 30,000 workers, including more than 10,000 Chinese workers. In the past, because the Qing government could not manage it, they were willing to give way. What else can be said? The British occupation of Ban Hong this time was due to the fact that in the autumn of last year, the Yunnan Fu Dian Bank sent people to conduct a survey to engage in mining Ban Hong silver mines and was about to start planning to proceed, which was known to the British. They took preemptive action and sent workers to invade Ban Hong for mining this spring. The five Tusi of Shanghulu refused to accept this and rose up to argue, which led to the conflict. In order to protect the miners, the British sent 2,000 troops into the country to implement armed occupation, and the situation is serious. Neighboring counties such as Lancang and Zhenkang were shocked and reported to the Yunnan Provincial Government for a halt. The provincial government could not deal with it because it involved foreign affairs, and the situation became increasingly serious. At present, the natives and the British are fighting every day."</p>

<p>Chinese Laborers Recruited in Baoding Discovered</p>
<p>More Than 20,000 Chinese Laborers Transported to Rehe</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: After the fall of Rehe, the Japanese paid special attention to the construction of the province. They paid special attention to the construction of buildings, digging wells, and water conservancy projects.

Last night, a batch of workers was discovered by the police in Baoding and were all detained. They will be sent back to their hometowns separately. According to people from Goryeoyoung, a certain Japanese merchant firm sent personnel to Goryeoyoung on the 15th of this month to set up a "Chinese Labor Collection and Transportation Office." Since the 18th, Japanese people have been leading Chinese farmers from Beiping to Goryeoyoung in an endless stream. They were transported in batches by heavy trucks to Gubeikou. According to Japanese businessman Sakata, a total of 20 trucks are used to transport goods between Goryeoyoung and Gubeikou. According to Chinese laborers who arrived there, they were recruited by Japanese people in Shandong and Hebei provinces, including Zhengding and Dingxian, under the guise of recruiting Chinese laborers. Their journey was from various places by train to Xizhimen Railway Station, then walking to Goryeoyoung, and then taking a bus to Rehe. However, the Japanese did not specify what kind of work they would be doing when they recruited them. In recent days, hundreds of Chinese laborers have arrived at Goryeoyoung from Beiping every day and have been transported away by the Japanese by truck. It is said that the total number of Chinese laborers recruited this time is about 20,000. (27th)</p>

<h3 id="e105">Qingdao: Traitorous Plot Exposed <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Major Riot Scheduled</p>
<p>Dozens of Traitors Arrested</p>
<p>Confessions Indicate Japanese Instigation</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Qingdao is an important town in North China and the gateway to Shandong. The Japanese have long coveted it. Last year, when the war in North China had not yet stopped, Japanese puppets secretly sent ruffians to Qingdao to collude with local traitors in the hope of staging an incident. However, due to the tight defense of the city's military and police, the matter did not succeed. Currently, the Qingdao Match Company has suspended operations due to the unbearable burden of consolidated taxes, and various yarn factories are also laying off workers due to sluggish business. As a result, the number of newly unemployed people in the city has exceeded 10,000. The Japanese saw an opportunity and used unemployed workers to secretly plan to disrupt the city's security. The Public Security Bureau had long been aware of this, so it paid close attention to the actions of Japanese ruffians and idle individuals. On the afternoon of the 24th of this month, at about 2:00 PM, people were repeatedly seen entering and exiting the seaside park. The nearby guards suspected that these people were suspicious, so they reported to the General Bureau, which sent several detectives to investigate. By the time they arrived, three people were still in the park. They were immediately arrested and taken to the bureau for strict interrogation. According to Sun Zuochen, Hu Maoxiao, and a person surnamed Ge (name unknown), they were instigated by the Japanese to prepare for a major riot at 8:00 PM on the 24th to occupy Qingdao and then hoist a puppet flag. The riot plan was as follows: (1) It was stipulated that the uprising would take place at 8:00 PM on the 24th, with the blackout of city streetlights as the signal. (2) After the lights went out, more than 700 Japanese and Chinese people would simultaneously depart from the Japanese Daigong Company (location unknown). The Japanese would transport bullets in cars with Japanese flags. (3) Ten Japanese, all dressed in Chinese clothing and armed with guns, would travel back and forth to direct. The Chinese would each carry bombs, and every two people would seize a policeman's gun. (4) Three machine guns would surround the Public Security Bureau. (5) The puppet flag would be hoisted four hours after Qingdao was occupied. (6) If the Chinese military and police resisted and their forces were unable to withstand it, the Japanese would immediately remove their Chinese clothing and change into Japanese clothing. (7) If Han Fuju's troops moved east, they would use landmines to destroy the Jiaoji Railway to prevent their eastward movement. (8) The Japanese office was located in the Japanese dormitory of the Gongda Yarn Factory, and the Chinese office was located on the third floor of the Hongtai Market in Beiping and the third floor of the market in Taitong Town. Items nine, ten, and eleven are unknown. After obtaining the confessions, the Public Security Bureau immediately ordered a temporary martial law to be implemented. Starting at 6:00 PM that night, double guards were added, and starting at 10:00 PM, all pedestrians were strictly interrogated. Security teams and patrol officers from various branch bureaus were dispatched in shifts to patrol in order to ensure thoroughness. At the same time, they requested the Navy to transfer all the Marine Corps stationed in Chengyang back to Qingdao to cooperate in defense. The traitors knew that the matter had been exposed, and because the military and police were already prepared, they dared not act that night. On the 25th, the Public Security Bureau ordered the arrested traitors Sun Zuochen and others to act as informants and arrested more than 20 traitors in Sifang and Cangkou. The remaining unarrested traitors had already fled upon hearing the news. The Public Security Bureau is currently searching for them. (27th)</p>
<h3 id="e106">Situation of the Kailuan Labor Strike <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Instructors Helped Workers Establish Two Organizations</p>
<p>Workers Paraded and Demonstrated, Demanding Compensation</p>
<p>Workers at the East Fourth Mine Decided Not to Participate in the Strike</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Kailuan Tangshan mine strike, which began on the 18th, has been going on for ten days. Although the strike has not spread, it will take some time to resolve. Tao Shangming returned to Tangshan on the 22nd to cooperate with Gu Zhen, the assistant manager of Kailuan Mines, and Xu Huidong, the director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Headquarters, to mediate between labor and management. The striking workers demanded police compensation and coal bonuses from the mine, as well as an increase in wages of eight points and the issuance of monthly coal tickets to each person. On the other hand, they demanded compensation for the wounded and dead from the Public Security Bureau. The mine has not yet responded to the conditions proposed by the workers. The workers established two organizations on the 23rd: (1) the Hebei Province War Zone Mine Workers Autonomous Joint General Union and (2) the Labor-Management Cooperation General Society. A congress was held at the Tianhe Inn at the station on the same day, with the participation of a dispatch team from the Japanese Tangshan Military Police, which seemed to be guiding them. After the establishment of the two organizations, offices were set up on Guangdong Street, and Zhao Dazhong was elected as the chairman by the workers. Zhao was previously a low-ranking officer in the puppet army. He came to Luan County last year and, relying on the power of the Japanese, became involved with some workers. Zhao Xun, the director of the Public Security Bureau, fearing that the striking workers would be exploited by foreigners, summoned the representatives to discuss the matter. The workers initially proposed eighteen demands, then twelve. The important conditions were to provide generous compensation for the wounded and dead, to punish the perpetrators who opened fire, and to guarantee that such incidents would not occur again in the future. Although the authorities knew that their demands were excessive, they feared that excessive rejection would easily lead to the expansion of the strike, so they agreed to continue the discussion. On the 23rd, the striking workers learned that the workers from the East Fourth Mine (Majiagou, Zhaogezhuang, Gucheng, Linxi) had issued a declaration that they would not provide any assistance to the Tangshan mine strike, so some workers became quite repentant. Many of the inner shift workers were persuaded by the mine manager and the engineers to start working. However, many more workers were coerced by the striking workers and did not immediately return to work. Although the striking workers insisted that they would not stop until they achieved their goals, they actually had few supporters, and their arrogance had also diminished. Only three or four hundred people with certain backgrounds refused to stop and had even organized a workers' joint team, divided into four large teams and three platoons, with leaders and other titles. Each worker wore a red cloth strip and carried a wooden stick, parading through the city like a military force. On the 24th, because the inner shift workers resumed work, the striking workers gathered outside the mine entrance and prevented food from being sent in, causing the inner shift workers to go without food and were forced to stop working. On the same day, the workers presented a demand to Tao Shangming that whether from the government or the mine, funds must be provided to compensate the wounded and dead workers, 2,000 yuan for each death and 500 yuan for each injured person. Tao Shangming refused to accept this, and the workers threatened to hold a large-scale parade and demonstration. Tao, fearing an accident, tried his best to stop them and summoned Zhao Dazhong, the chairman elected by the workers, for face-to-face negotiations. Tao agreed to convey the workers' demands to the mine and provide generous compensation for the wounded and dead. The workers had nothing more to say at this point, but they demanded a quick reply, otherwise, they would still parade and demonstrate. The workers of the Dongsi mine, because the actions of the Tang mine workers exceeded the norm, issued two declarations: one, advising the workers of the Dongsi mine not to be incited by others to join the Tang mine strike, and two, advising the Tang mine workers to repent as soon as possible and not to be traitors for others to exploit. The Tang mine striking workers, seeing that the Dongsi mine expressed unexpected intentions, also issued declarations and posted slogans with the words "Down with the Dongsi mine workers union." The mine and the authorities are now optimistic about the matter, that is, the Dongsi mine will not be affected by the Tang mine strike, and that the Tang mine strike is only a small number of people's activities, which is not worth worrying about. However, the gunpowder depot of the Tangshan Qixin Cement Plant suddenly exploded yesterday morning, and all the gunpowder was destroyed. A bomb was also found in front of the Xinyu Gong on Xiaoma Road, which inevitably made people feel uneasy, and the background became more obvious. The Tangshan Public Security Bureau then announced martial law again, and the gates in the city were closed tightly from 8:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning. (15th)</p>
<h3 id="e107">Songjiang: Disputes Over District Establishment After Division <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Previously, the county received instructions from the Department of Civil Affairs that, for the convenience of promoting autonomy, it had previously held a district division meeting and decided to divide the sixteen districts into eight districts. Regarding the location of the district offices, a follow-up meeting was held today (28th) to summon the original townships and towns to merge as much as possible according to the standards promulgated by the department, with a standard of 500 to 1,000 households. After a decision is made, it will be submitted to the province for approval. However, each district has many disputes over the location of the district office. For example, when Zhangze and Yexie are merged, it was originally decided to set up a district branch office in Yexie. When Xiaokunshan and Tianmashan are merged, the district office will be set up in Xiaokunshan. When Xinzhuangzhuang and Qibao are merged, the district office will be set up in Wujiatang. When Shanyang and Caoging are merged, the district office will be set up in Caoging. However, at today's meeting, the people of Zhangze, Tianmashan, Xinzhuang, and Shanyang had many disputes over the location of the district, and the debate was fierce and could not be resolved. After voting, it was decided to submit it to the province for approval after the county government investigates.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Wuxi: Expansion of the Li Shuyun Case <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhuomin, the former director of the Second Public Security Bureau, refused to hand over [his duties], involving the case of Li Shuyun, the wife of Director Gu of the Department of Civil Affairs. The county court telegraphed Gu to appear in court for questioning. Li Shuyun has also hired lawyer Chao Kun to sue Gu Renfa for bigamy, and the case is expanding. The details are listed below: (1) The county court prosecutor's office telegraphed the province to request Gu Renfa to appear in court for questioning. The province replied by telegram that Gu had gone from Jiangxi to Wuhan and could not appear in court. Now that Gu has returned to the province and is working as usual, and the case was reported by Director Gu of the Department of Civil Affairs, it is necessary to appear in court for questioning. Therefore, another telegram has been sent to the province requesting Gu to bring evidence to Wuxi to testify, so that the case can be easily investigated. (2) The prosecutor's office continued to sign and summon Liu Zhuomin for questioning in court yesterday afternoon. Liu confessed that he owed 400 yuan in public funds due to handover matters, so he went to Zhenjiang to borrow money. He did not expect Wuxi to be eager to take over, so his wife sent a quick letter urging him to return and handle the handover. This proves that there was no resistance. As for the letters sent by friends in Jiangxi, they were ordinary socializing and had no other effect. After questioning, he was sent back to prison. (3) After 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, Chief Qian continued to summon Li Shuyun to inquire in detail about the marriage issue with Director Gu. Li confessed that she was indeed Gu's legal wife and only learned this year that Gu still had a wife. She then asked him for a solution, but Gu was summoned to Jiangxi and promised to make a satisfactory solution after returning to the province. Unexpectedly, Director Gu of the Department of Civil Affairs reported her for selling official positions and accumulating money, fearing that she would accuse him of bigamy or fraud marriage, so he took this preemptive measure. After questioning, she was still sent back to prison. (4) The initiation of this case stemmed from Liu Zhuomin's refusal to hand over [his duties]. Liu's wife, Wen Rongzhen, also claimed to be surnamed Li and to be sisters with Li Shuyun. Now that they are in the same cell, they rarely talk after meeting. Shuyun blamed her for not climbing the social ladder and falsely claiming relatives, which has caused her mother and daughter to be imprisoned. She asked, "Can you be at peace with your conscience?" Wen was blamed and speechless, but behind Li's back, she said, "He came to complain to me. The fact is that Director Gu wanted to divorce him, so he made a trap and used my husband as a starting point. Now we are harmed by him." The truth in this is worth pondering. (5) When Li Shuyun and her daughter were arrested in Shanghai, they hired three lawyers, Zhang Shizhao, Xiang Xun, and Tan Xinzhen, to defend them. After they were transferred to Wuxi, they transferred the case to lawyer Chao Kun to handle. Yesterday, lawyer Chao came to Wuxi from Shanghai and visited Li Shuyun in the detention center. Li happened to be taken out of the women's prison to wait for questioning. Li said that she went to Shanghai from Zhenjiang on the 17th for medical treatment and lived with her mother in Huang Gongguan. She sent a quick letter to Gu, and the receipt for the quick letter is with Mr. Huang (a European). There is other evidence in Huang's house that can be obtained. She immediately wrote a letter saying, "Please give all the evidence to lawyer Chao. To Mr. Huang, Gu Li Shuyun." She also expressed gnashing hatred for the case, saying, "I have decided to countersue for bigamy and fraud marriage. I have been harmed to such an extent. Why not countersue?" Li's face was thin, her spirit was sluggish, she groaned constantly, and her illness had not yet healed. Those who saw her could not help but feel compassion. (6) Lawyer Chao told reporters that the case was initially divided into two parts: (A) Li Shuyun flaunted and sold official positions, (B) Instigated Liu Zhuomin and his wife to obstruct official duties. Li Shuyun is in the position of the defendant. The prosecutor's office is investigating the case. Now Li firmly insists on suing Gu for bigamy and fraud marriage. Li is in the position of the plaintiff. Whether Gu has committed bigamy should be investigated by the prosecutor's office after the lawsuit is filed. As for the wife of the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs being arrested in a case, the district chief of the subordinate Water Police District was ordered to arrest her in person. If the wife of the Minister of the Navy needed to be summoned for something, would the Marine Corps be ordered to arrest her? This can be said to be a ridiculous story. (7) Yesterday, news was received from the capital that the Li Shuyun case is involving more and more people. Gu's wife, Ai Chengmei, who now lives in Nanjing, has sued Gu for bigamy in the capital's court. (8) Yan Shenyu, the county magistrate of this county, immediately telegraphed the province to resign after the case occurred. Various local groups telegraphed to retain him. Yan continued to request resignation again. Chairman Chen of the provincial government, considering the public's strong desire to retain him, appointed Zeng Binqiu, the director of the Second Section of the Department of Civil Affairs, who was inspecting Changshu, and made a long-distance call to ask him to go to Wuxi to console and retain him. After Zeng arrived in Wuxi, he met with County Magistrate Yan and explained the province's expectations. However, Yan's determination to leave was very strong. Because Director Gu had returned to the department to handle affairs, he would go to Zhenjiang on the 27th to present everything to Chairman Chen and Director Gu in person. It is now heard that after the sincere consolation of the provincial department, he has dispelled the intention to resign. (9) Zeng Binqiu, the director of the Second Section of the Department of Civil Affairs, was appointed to Wuxi and stayed at the New World Hotel under the pseudonym Hu Zhengong. His whereabouts were extremely confidential. He first went to the residence of Li Wengong, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to discuss something. He stayed at Li's residence that night, and only met with County Magistrate Yan the next day.</p>

Special attention will be paid to the land producing opium seedlings in the Xuhai area. Addicts will be ordered to register and obtain licenses within a time limit. Those who fail to do so will not be issued licenses. All license fees and fines from private addicts will be used for health undertakings, opium suppression propaganda, police team inspection fees, rural relief, and special construction costs.</p>

<p>The express boat from Linghu to Xinshi was robbed on the morning of the 25th of this month. When it passed Xiaonei River, about four miles from Qianjin, a bandit boat suddenly appeared. Four bandits, two of whom were holding wooden cases, ordered the express boat to stop. The boat owner, Ma Yuhua, saw that the bandits had guns and dared not resist, so he ordered the boat crew to moor the boat. The bandits boarded the boat and searched at will, robbing the boat owner Ma Yuhua of 25 yuan in silver dollars, over 100 small silver coins, Qianji goods worth 50 yuan in silver dollars, Zhengchang goods worth 100 yuan in silver dollars, Yongda worth 2.3 yuan, and over 10 yuan from each of the passengers. The bandits then sped away in the original boat. Afterwards, the boat owner, Ma Yuhua, sailed the boat back and reported the robbery to the Qianjin Water Police Team before reporting the robbery to the various agencies in Linghu and requesting them to pursue and arrest the bandits.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Public Discussion of Enrichment (Continued) by Zhang Yuanruo <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>(4) National Economy (Note 12)</p>
<p>(1) The law of enrichment is a response to social life. The spirit of constitutionalism should evolve with the times and be reformed due to changes in social life. In the past, people were oppressed by monarchs and aristocrats, so political freedom was the only good remedy for liberating the people and the most important and precious principle when drafting a constitution. Today's society has changed its old appearance. The suffering of the people from the oppression of capital is far greater than the political oppression of the past, so economic liberation is the urgent requirement of the people of today. Therefore, the purpose of modern constitutionalism is not only to seek the protection of political rights, but also to attach importance to the protection of economic rights; not only to ensure the freedom of the people, but also to impose necessary social obligations on the people. However, the law is not a subjective formality. The essential condition for its implementation is objective fact. An empty law is not enough to implement itself, and a painted cake is not enough to satisfy hunger. This is the main reason for the failure of constitutionalism in China since the Republic, and a factual problem that those who care about the rule of law should earnestly study in the future. After the European War, the world's constitutions have undergone a great change, all with a spirit of socialism. "However, this kind of movement was initially just blind following, and few were able to consider it calmly. Therefore, in the end, political power still belonged to the moderates. This victory of moderation is actually a major fact in the post-war revolutionary movement and the new constitutions of various countries." (Note 13) Therefore, after the war, countries such as Yugoslavia, Romania, Estonia, Lithuania, and Poland were extremely left-leaning at first, but due to the influence of the German Revolution, they all changed their minds. Even the stubborn Soviet Russia eventually changed its course due to practical political experience and the control of objective conditions.</p>
<p>China is plagued by many disasters. The people are deeply devastated by natural and man-made disasters, and oppressed by foreign aggression and internal turmoil. The industry is declining, and the production technology is immature, resulting in the general public not being able to maintain their minimum standard of living. Those who are trapped by hunger and cold and wandering in the gutters are too numerous to count. Therefore, the urgent task for China today is to jointly seek to recuperate and develop national capital. Reckless destruction is not tolerated by socio-economic conditions. Even completely imitating the moderate German constitution is sometimes not allowed by objective facts. The constitution is not something that is written behind closed doors but something that grows. The provisions of the constitution must be based on the foundation of society to have the possibility of actual implementation. Therefore, today's drafters or critics of the constitution should have a down-to-earth and pragmatic spirit. Otherwise, the magnificent constitution will not only be useless, but will also be mutually incompatible and run counter to the social foundation and economic situation.</p>
<p>Based on this principle, although we are not entirely satisfied with Chapter 3 of the draft constitution in theory, we dare not go too high in practice and make emotional criticisms. The reason why political opinions have been complicated and ineffective in the past is precisely due to this drawback. If the government can truly seek to implement each and every provision of the constitution, it is already commendable. Moreover, since our country's industry is immature, if individual enterprises can seek to avoid harming the interests of the country and the nation, it is also necessary to encourage their development. We should not completely obliterate them because of longing for the realm of extreme socialism. (Note 14)</p>
<p>What we are dissatisfied with is roughly two points. (1) Developing national capital is extremely important, but the constitution does not have a single provision for this, which seems regrettable. Article 156 of the German Constitution can be used as a reference, but it does not need to be completely copied. (2) Article 31 of the draft constitution advocates labor-capital coordination. In principle, there is nothing to criticize, and it is very in line with national conditions. However, how this principle should be implemented is not found in the entire constitution, which is equivalent to empty talk. Here, Chapter 5, Article 165 of the German Constitution can be used as a reference. At the same time, Italy's political system and trade union system can also be used as a reference. (Note 15) (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e114">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Revise Sino-American Commercial Treaty <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Repeal Ban on Chinese Entering America</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday cabled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, "According to your esteemed office, the Sino-American Commercial Treaty of the 29th year of Guangxu, which is now due to expire and be revised, does not stipulate how Chinese people residing in the United States should be treated. The stipulations only restrict continued travel by Chinese laborers and do not apply to officials, educators, students, merchants, and tourists. This is actually the Chinese Labor Treaty of the 20th year of Guangxu. This time, regarding the ban on Chinese laborers, whether to revise it together is something the Chamber cannot determine. However, according to Article 1 of the treaty, the United States' self-imposed restrictions on Chinese laborers returning to the United States must not contradict the provisions of this treaty. Therefore, the United States' self-imposed regulations, which add restrictions outside the text of the treaty, originally violate the treaty. Moreover, self-imposed regulations refer to Chinese laborers returning to the United States, while merchants, students, and five other categories of people originally have the wording 'enjoying the benefits of residing in the United States without hindrance.' Therefore, the United States has no right to self-impose regulations to restrict these five categories of people, which is perfectly clear. The United States Immigration Bureau distorts the meaning of 'merchant' to refer to international trade and restricts teachers, only allowing university professors to enter the United States while rejecting primary and secondary school teachers. This is clearly creating new problems outside the treaty. Therefore, what is being contested today is not the issue of signing or revising the treaty, but the issue of the execution of the treaty. The origin of this problem lies in the fact that past envoys and consuls have allowed the Immigration Bureau to act recklessly and have not argued based on the treaty, resulting in Chinese people encountering obstacles when entering the United States. If the Chinese Labor Treaty of the 20th year of Guangxu can be revised during this treaty revision, it would be very good. Otherwise, the meaning of merchants and students should be clearly defined in the continued Commercial Treaty to avoid arbitrary obstruction by customs officials in that country. This is a unanimous demand of the entire country. We respectfully request your esteemed ministry to review and implement it for the sake of public convenience. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows respectfully, Qin."</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek launched the New Life Movement in Nanchang, the whole country has responded and it has become a temporary trend. The Central Mass Movement Guidance Committee has also issued a telegram calling on the masses to work hard to promote it. The precariousness of our country's national strength and the desolation of people's lives cannot be revived without hard work. The way of revolution must be concise and ensure that the general public has national morality and knowledge, so that society can progress. Therefore, enduring hardship and hard work, practicing thrift, reforming bad habits, and abstaining from extravagance to cultivate clean and simple habits are the basic work for saving the country and preserving its existence. Since the establishment of the preparatory office of the New Life Movement Promotion Association in Shanghai, various circles have joined one after another, and the number of initiators has reached more than 500. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, in order to urge the progress, convened a meeting yesterday afternoon, and leading figures from the party, government, and military circles, including Tao Baichuan, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Jiang Huaisu, Yu Hongjun, etc., attended the meeting to discuss the guiding principles, propaganda outlines, and organizational regulations of the New Life Movement. It was also decided to hold a New Life Movement Conference on April 1 to submit it to the official meeting of the Promotion Association for approval and implementation. The promotion work is divided into several phases. Mayor Wu believes that order and cleanliness are the first practical goal. Therefore, he has instructed the Public Security Bureau and the Health Bureau to formulate implementation methods and instructed the police to give guidance and work with the people to implement it.</p>

The "Air Force Comrade" aircraft, donated by all officers and soldiers of the Aviation Administration, was also built independently by the factory. Except for the engines purchased from overseas, all other parts were made domestically. The "Batavia Overseas Chinese" and "Air Force Comrade" aircraft have long been under construction, and a naming ceremony will be held as soon as they are completed. It should be noted that this is the beginning of Chinese people manufacturing their own airplanes and holding naming ceremonies.</p>

<p>Met with Reporters Yesterday to Report on Mission of Trip</p>
<p>Date of Inspection of Shaanxi and Gansu Provinces Set for One Month</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday after attending the plenary session of the council in Beijing. Mr. Song is scheduled to depart for the Northwest this week for an inspection. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Mr. Song met with a group of reporters at the council's Shanghai office and announced the mission of this inspection trip. A summary of his remarks is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Departing This Week <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Song first stated that, regarding the Northwest inspection, it was originally scheduled to depart on the 28th (yesterday) with Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, etc. However, because some procedures have not yet been prepared, the departure date has been slightly postponed. President Dai has already departed from Beijing today (yesterday) with several foreign experts, while he himself has decided to depart from Shanghai within a week. However, the report that he is scheduled to travel by Eurasian plane on the 3rd of next month is not true. This trip is scheduled to last for one month, and only Cai Shousun, Chen Zhixiang, and Qin Yingchun, the council's secretaries, will accompany him.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Scope of Inspection <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Song continued, "The itinerary for this trip is to first go to Xi'an in Shaanxi to meet with President Dai, then to Lanzhou in Gansu. Whether to go to Qinghai will depend on the time available and will be decided at that time. Due to various reasons, it is not convenient to go to Xinjiang at this time. As for the trip to Sichuan, it will be made after returning to Shanghai. As for the scope of the inspection, it will focus on roads, water conservancy, and sanitation. Furthermore, the council's Northwest Office has already been established in Xi'an, and Liu Jinshan has been appointed as the director. There are some issues at the office that still need to be discussed with me in person."</p>
<h3 id="e129">Allocation Method <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the future work of the National Economic Council, Mr. Song answered a reporter's question and said that the National Economic Council's funding has always been diverted from the US cotton and wheat loans. The amount of this loan has been reduced to 20 million US dollars, which is approximately 50 million yuan in national currency. After deducting the principal repayment and transportation costs, only 12.3 million yuan can be used. The conference passed a resolution to use this amount, with 16 million yuan used to reorganize the currency system, and 15 million yuan used for the National Economic Council's construction expenses this year. The allocation has also been decided as follows: 6,800,000 yuan for roads, 500,000 yuan for sanitation, 1,000,000 yuan for the cotton industry, 750,000 yuan for the silk industry, 1,900,000 yuan for Jiangxi construction, 2,500,000 yuan for Northwest construction, 64,000 yuan for the tea industry, 100,000 yuan for fuel research, 200,000 yuan for economic research, 750,000 yuan for general management fees and expert expenses, and 436,000 yuan for reserve funds, totaling 15,000,000 yuan.</p>

<p>As for the League of Nations' technical cooperation with China, Rajchman, the expert sent to China, has indeed decided to leave China in the near future. Because the League of Nations Executive Council meeting is scheduled to be held in Geneva on May 16, the League of Nations General Assembly has specially summoned Rajchman back to report on his work in China in order to understand the situation and be prepared to report at the meeting on time. The rumors that Rajchman is resigning this time are not true.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Yunnan Native Place Association in Shanghai Cables Central Government to Resolve Yunnan Issue Expeditiously <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Tiannan Society Issues Circular in Response</p>
<p>The incident of British troops invading and occupying Ban Hong is serious and has attracted the attention of people across the country. The Yunnan Native Place Association in Shanghai held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at its association hall in Datong Lane, Buick Road yesterday to discuss countermeasures. More than a dozen people attended, including Zhang Yaozeng, Lü Tianmin, Sun Ji'an, Yang Jialin, and Zhao Zhi. The meeting was chaired by Zhang Yaozeng, the executive director. First, Lü Tianmin, a member of the Supervisory Yuan of the National Government, reported on the disputes in the Yunnan-Burma border area and the previous negotiations. Then, Zhao Yunyan, an officer of the 13th Division who was familiar with the Yunnan border situation, reported on the actual situation of the Ban Hong gold and silver mining area, as well as the conspiracy of British missionaries in Yunnan to confuse the masses through preaching and to investigate border defenses. The atmosphere at the meeting was unusually tense. The key resolutions are recorded below:</p>
<p>Three Key Resolutions: It was unanimously resolved to (1) send a telegram to support the proposal of the Yunnan Native Place Association in Nanjing, requesting the central government to resolve the Yunnan-Burma border dispute expeditiously and strengthen Yunnan's border defense; (2) suggest to the Yunnan Provincial Government to develop transportation in Yunnan and immigrate people to the Yunnan border to strengthen border defense; (3) convene a general meeting of all fellow villagers, decided to be held in mid-April.</p>
<p>Tiannan Society Circular: The Tiannan Society, organized by Yunnan students from Great China University, also issued a circular to the country yesterday, stating that it is willing to act as a support for Yunnan affairs. The original text reads: "All agencies, legal entities, schools, newspapers, and fellow citizens across the country, please note: According to recent reports, the United Kingdom has sent more than 2,000 troops from Burma into Yunnan, occupying Ban Hong and arbitrarily building roads and mining. Alarming news has spread, shocking us. Ban Hong is located in southwestern Yunnan, covering thousands of square miles and is rich in gold, silver, and coal mines. It has always been part of our country's territory. This time, the British took advantage of our country's difficulties and used the same old trick of occupying Pianma by force, seizing it by force and treating China as nothing. All those with blood and courage cannot but be furious. The only way forward is to urge the government to negotiate seriously with the United Kingdom to ensure that British troops withdraw as soon as possible and persevere until the goal is achieved. The fundamental plan is that the government and the people must cooperate sincerely, determine borders, rectify internal affairs, develop transportation, consolidate border defense, develop mineral resources, and revitalize industry to make our country strong and prosperous and prevent others from coveting it. We are patriotic and dare not lag behind. We vow to follow people from all walks of life to act as a diplomatic support. We respectfully announce this to you for your consideration. Tiannan Society, Great China University, Shanghai, bows respectfully."</p>

<p>Only Discussing Shape, Not Sound, Easily Leads to Counterfeiting</p>
<p>Qian Chengxu Entered Beijing Last Night to Discuss with the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>According to the Riri News Agency, after the Judicial Yuan announced its interpretation of the Trademark Law, Hu Xiyuan and other members of the Shanghai Industrial Federation believed that it only discussed shape and not sound, which would easily lead to counterfeiting and would invalidate the protection of trademarks. They sent a joint letter to the Industrial Federation, appointing Qian Chengxu to enter Beijing last night by night express to request the Ministry of Industry to correct it and provide another interpretation. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e133">Letter Requesting Correction <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Hu Xiyuan and other members of the China Industrial Federation sent a joint letter to the Industrial Federation yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you to express our shock at the news that the Judicial Yuan's interpretation of Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Trademark Law only discusses shape and not sound. Although our country has a vast territory and complex dialects, this has not been the case since today. However, the pronunciation of characters has always been based on the national pronunciation as the standard, so it is not without a standard. Now, abandoning sound and only paying attention to shape will inevitably lead to increased disputes over butterflies and nonsense. The hard-earned industrial and commercial enterprises will lose their protection. We believe that this is unacceptable. We plan to ask your association to state the advantages and disadvantages and request the Ministry of Industry to correct it quickly. Is this appropriate? We hope for your wise decision."</p>
<h3 id="e134">Qian Chengxu's Trip to Beijing <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Qian Chengxu, the executive director of the China Industrial Federation, due to the joint request of the members, took the express train to Beijing last night to discuss the matter with the industry authorities. According to Qian's remarks before his departure, "The education of the Chinese people is not yet widespread. Most people in the interior recognize the sound of goods and are careless about recognizing the characters. Now, the Judicial Yuan's interpretation that the same sound does not entail responsibility is tantamount to fundamentally invalidating the protection of trademarks. For example, the trademark of Shenxin brand cotton yarn is a 'Ren Zhong' (person bell). Not long ago, several factories renamed Japanese yarn as 'Chen Zhong' (morning bell) and sold it as Shenxin's Ren Zhong brand. This matter later caused a very big problem. I think society can still remember this matter. Cases like this, the law cannot be too strict, but in view of the facts, the Chinese situation is like this, we should guard against it before it happens. Otherwise, disputes in the future will inevitably arise one after another, and both merchants and factories will be affected. This can be asserted. This time I am entering the capital at the joint request of many members of the China Industrial Association to discuss countermeasures with the central industry authorities to seek remedies. It is expected that the Ministry of Industry will ask the Ministry of Justice to provide another interpretation to achieve the goal."</p>

<h3 id="e136">City Umbrella Industry Workers Announce Work Stoppage Starting Yesterday <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Reason: Opposition to Employer Dismissal of Workers</p>
<p>Representatives from Various Factories Petition Government and Party Organizations</p>
<p>Over a thousand workers in the city's umbrella industry, dissatisfied with the employers' dismissal of workers, declared a work stoppage yesterday. The employers have petitioned government and party organizations. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Announcing Work Stoppage: The Umbrella Industry Union held a meeting at its clubhouse on Shenxiangge Road at 7 PM the day before yesterday to re-elect its executive and supervisory committee. Lu Yinchu from the City Party Headquarters, Zhu Guilin from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Fang Rusheng from the General Labor Union attended to provide guidance. After the election, they immediately discussed response measures. The consensus was that the employers were reducing wages and dismissing a large number of workers, so they decided to announce a work stoppage immediately. However, the employers stated that the workers had already left their jobs, effectively implementing a work stoppage.</p>
<p>Employer Petition: The day before yesterday evening, Wen Tulan, the junior owner of Yingfeng Umbrella Factory at the intersection of Fuyou Road and Yanhai Road, and his mother, after advising workers to resume work during the work stoppage, became embroiled in disputes with the workers. As a result, Wen Tulan was severely injured in an assault, and his mother was also injured. Some workers were also injured. Fifty-three umbrella factories, including Huali, Global, etc., considering the unwarranted strike by workers, sent representatives Ni Guorui, Lu Zhankui, Lu Jinkui, Tang Wenbin, and 49 others to the City Party Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the City Chamber of Commerce at noon yesterday to petition for a halt to the workers' strike. Wang Xianqing of the Social Affairs Bureau received them and promised to send personnel for a thorough investigation today. Zhu Boyuan of the City Chamber of Commerce received them and promised to request instructions for handling the matter. When the representatives arrived at the City Party Headquarters, they had already passed office hours, so they changed their petition to today.</p>

<h3 id="e146">After Completion <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The population density in the Shaoxing area is the same as that in the Ningbo section. In terms of cargo, the products include vegetable oil, tin foil, Shaoxing wine, fresh fruit, grain cocoons, cotton, cotton yarn, sugar cane, lime, coarse paper, north-south foods, salted fish, and tobacco. It is found that the Ningbo section carries approximately 130,000 tons of cargo annually, of which 30 percent goes to and from Shaoxing, and 40 percent goes to and from Xixing, transshipped to Zhuji, Lanxi, and other places. Calculated at the average third-class freight rate, the annual income is approximately 250,000 yuan, which, together with passenger transport, is at least 600,000 yuan. In the future, after completion, the revenue of the Railway Bureau will certainly increase.</p>
<h3 id="e147">International Trade Bureau Handling Jiangxi Tea Exchange for Polish Goods <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>He Bingxian Currently in Contact with the Polish Embassy</p>
<p>Industrialists Express That the Future is Difficult</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the local International Trade Bureau, previously ordered by the Ministry of Industry to find a way to sell Jiangxi's abundant Wuning tea abroad, would exchange 1 million yuan worth of Ning tea for the same value of kerosene from the Soviet Union to avoid either side feeling exploited. Consequently, He Bingxian, the director of the bureau, took responsibility for contacting the Russian side. However, it is recently rumored that the exchange of Jiangxi tea for Russian oil is no longer possible, and there is another proposal to exchange for goods of the same value from Poland. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, the reporter inquired with He Bingxian, the director of the International Trade Bureau, and industrialists about the details. The information obtained is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e148">Exchange for Russian Oil Failed <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. He, the reporter first learned that the bureau was ordered by the Ministry of Industry to handle the exchange of Ning tea for oil from the Soviet Union. At that time, he contacted the Soviet Union's Youbiandi Company, which operates oil in China. Unexpectedly, after consultation between the two parties, the Soviet Union's gasoline coal sold to China had to be purchased with cash due to accounting reasons, while the shipment of Chinese tea to Russia would only be paid for after one year. Because of this problem, Chinese tea is already in decline, and there is no centralized purchasing agency for this million yuan of Jiangxi tea. If small-scale operators have to wait a year to get the price, their finances will of course be unable to circulate, and they will be unable to continue. Therefore, it was terminated.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Poland Agreed to Exchange Goods <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>As for exchanging goods with Poland, it is true. However, it is still under study. The matter came about because the Polish ambassador mentioned it to Minister Chen when he passed through Nanjing from the north a few days ago. He said that China has 4 million of Jiangxi Ning tea, and in order to promote Sino-Polish trade, it can be sold to Poland, but the price of 4 million yuan must be used to purchase goods in Poland for shipment to China. Therefore, he is considering proceeding with the matter with the counselor of the Polish embassy, and it is expected to be decided soon.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Industrialists Express Difficulties <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Subsequently, the reporter inquired with industrialists about the possibility of Sino-Polish exchange of goods. They learned that there are many difficulties in exchanging Polish goods for Chinese tea. According to customs import and export tables over the years, Polish goods sold to China are very small, while goods shipped from China to Poland are even fewer. Most of the Polish goods shipped to China are cotton and silk textiles, while those shipped from China to Poland are dried shrimp, pork intestines, black tea, peanuts, nets, and untanned hides. Although the total number of Polish shipments to China in 1928 reached more than 2,587,000 yuan, 2.5 million yuan of which were military supplies. Therefore, according to these statistics, it is actually impossible. Even if it can be exchanged, the goods that China wants to exchange for, no matter what the value, still need to be carefully studied.</p>

<p>The following is a record of customs reports on Sino-Polish trade over the years, counted from 1864 to 1932. Only from 1924 (i.e., the 13th year of the Republic of China) was there a definite record. The numbers are as follows:</p>
<p>(Year) (Price of Polish Goods Shipped to China) (Price of Chinese Goods Shipped to Poland)</p>
<p>1924 11,746</p>
<p>1925 37,913</p>
<p>1926 8,209</p>

<h3 id="e152">Navigation Conference Resolves to Establish Maritime Court <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>First in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangdong</p>
<p>Attached to Local Courts</p>
<p>The shipping industries of various countries are developed and well-organized. When major ship disputes occur, they are handled by maritime courts. China does not yet have such a judicial organ for handling ships. In recent years, although the Navigation Bureaus of Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Guangdong have established ship collision arbitration committees, they are still limited to collision matters. When major accidents occur on ships, there is still no legal organ to handle them. This has led to the shelving of major tragic cases over the years. For example, the Xin Kang ship was sunk by a Japanese ship, resulting in hundreds of deaths. The Tu Nan ship was sunk by the Chang Chun Wan, also drowning more than a hundred passengers and crew members. The perpetrators are not held responsible, the victims have no way to redress their grievances, and those who suffer losses often suffer losses. This has long-term consequences and is a matter of great concern. The organization of a maritime court cannot be delayed any longer. Among the agenda items discussed at this navigation conference, the most important, in addition to the recovery of inland waterway rights and the determination of navigation funds, is the organization of a maritime court, which is the most urgent. The conference proposed and agreed on a method of organizing one maritime court each in the important commercial ports of Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Qingdao, and other places. The maritime court will be attached to the local court. The position of president of the court will be filled by the appointment of a navigation expert with legal knowledge who has served as a shipowner for more than five years. As for the positions of judge and clerk, they will also be selected from legal scholars who are well-versed in navigation. The detailed organizational rules will be jointly determined by the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Because this case is urgent to implement, it has been resolved by the conference and submitted to the Ministry for prompt action. It has been decided to first organize and establish it in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangdong.</p>

<p>Striving for Balance Between City Treasury Revenue and Expenditure</p>
<p>Starting with Austerity</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government was affected by the January 28th Incident, although the financial authorities have made efforts to reorganize the revenue side, all reconstruction matters and construction projects require funds, making it difficult to achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure. Among them, the security expenses are borne entirely by the local government. The originally planned increase in land value tax could not be implemented according to the original plan due to consideration of the property owners' opinions. Therefore, the city treasury feels particularly strained. Now, at the start of the compilation of the budget for fiscal year 23, the municipal government will consider how to seek a balance between revenue and expenditure. However, since it is difficult to increase the burden on citizens any further, it will start with austerity.</p>

<p>Lu Zhulin, Wang Rusong, and Zhang Daorong, scouts of the third group of detectives of the French Concession Police, along with Bao Tan Shen Jinshi and Liu Jinle, arrested seven great robbers, Xu Guifa, Chen Rongsheng, Chen Jinchang, Zhang Qifu, Zhang Guibao, Chen Kejian, and Zhang Asan, at around 5:00 PM on January 30 of this year at 128 and a half Fuxu Road in the Shanghai International Settlement. It was discovered that the bandits had successively robbed six families in the French Concession: Wang Xianling at 20 Yuzhen Lane on Lafayette Road, Qiang Maosheng at 3 Deshun Lane on Consulate Road, Zhu Ningzhi at 68 Hengqing Lane on Baylor Road, Wang Songtao at 15 Renan Lane on Songshan Road, Lin Bingyi at 45 Lean Lane on Avenue Joffre, and Yuan Yongqing at 1 Zhishun Lane on Puenji Shishi Road in Xiaobangwan. They had also committed numerous major cases in the Chinese area and the Shanghai International Settlement, including robbing the China Bank of funds and robbing guests of diamond rings and pistols in brothels on Shantou Road. They were escorted to the Second Special District Court, where the police lawyer filed a public prosecution for the crime of repeat robbery. After the interrogation was concluded, a date was set for sentencing. While the convicts were detained in the police station, Chen Rongsheng died on the 23rd due to vomiting blood while in custody. Zhang Qifu, because of illness, was sent to Guangci Hospital, and due to fear of punishment, he committed suicide in the hospital toilet on the evening of the 24th. All the circumstances have been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday was the date of sentencing. In the morning at 10:00 AM, the police escorted the five convicts, including Xu, to the court.

<h3 id="e159">Merger of Wired and Wireless Telegraph Agencies May Be Realized <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Telecom Circles Express Approval and Are Studying Implementation</p>
<p>No Agreement Yet on Joint Establishment of Postal and Telegraph Branches</p>
<p>In order to innovate telecommunications administration, the Ministry of Transportation plans to merge wired and wireless telegraph bureaus and stations, instructing each bureau and station to study and contribute opinions. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed the heads of the local telecommunications administration to inquire about their views on this. According to the answer, wired and wireless are both national operating agencies, and they naturally strongly agree with the principle of merging. They also talked about the improvement of wired telegraph in recent years and the merger of postal branches and telegraph offices in this city. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Line Consolidation: Wired telegraph has been established since the late Qing Dynasty and has been around for decades. Although there are regulations for minor repairs every three years and major repairs every five years, they were only nominally enforced due to the unstable political situation. Those handling telecommunications administration also regarded it as a government office, resulting in corruption and delays, and the industry was not thriving. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the Ministry of Transportation has actively reorganized it in recent years. Last year, a total of 5,371 kilometers of telegraph lines were repaired: 3,732 kilometers of trunk lines and 1,639 kilometers of branch lines. Underwater lines are not included. Repairs will continue this year in order to ensure smooth communication.</p>
<p>Cooperation and Convenience: After the establishment of wireless telegraph stations, wired telegraph began to have competition in business, striving for speed in sending and receiving messages and eliminating the bad habits of bureaucratic government offices, making it convenient for people to use telecommunications. National enterprises are owned by all the people of the country, not the private property of the organizers, and should naturally strive to facilitate the people. Wired and wireless telegraph have their own strengths and cannot be abandoned. In European and American countries, wireless telecommunications have been very developed, but wired telecommunications still exist. Currently, there are one or two locations in this city where the sending and receiving offices of wired and wireless telegraph have been jointly established. There is solid cooperation in business. In the future, after the completion of the Transportation Building, various agencies under the Ministry of Transportation in this city, such as China Merchants Bureau, airlines, and international telegraph bureau, are planning to concentrate their offices in one place, which will not be a problem for the merger of wired and wireless telegraph bureaus.</p>
<p>Joint Postal and Telegraph Establishment: The Ministry of Transportation previously ordered the joint establishment of postal and telegraph offices in all third-class and lower bureaus. This city is a pilot area. The telegraph and postal authorities have repeatedly discussed the matter. Since there are 19 postal branches in this city, there is no need to set up sending and receiving offices in remote areas to avoid increasing expenses. In prosperous areas, they are planning to set up sending and receiving offices, but they must also consider whether there are surplus houses in the current postal branches that can be used jointly. Therefore, it has not yet been realized. Recently, the telegraph bureau first added a sending and receiving office in the Shanghai Bank branch in the West Gate, which began operating on April 1.</p>

<p>The train schedule for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways is usually changed once every year in March. This year, the schedule change is related to the implementation of joint transportation on national railways, which is related to all railways and must be convened by the Ministry to gather representatives from all railways to discuss. As a result, the new schedule was only finalized in mid-March and was announced a few days ago to be implemented on April 1. However, the railway bureau previously received a telephone call from Nanjing that there were still changes to be made. Therefore, yesterday, the two railways published in their daily newspapers the news that the implementation would be changed to April 11. The reporter specifically inquired with the railway bureau and learned that Nanjing again received a telephone call yesterday morning notifying that the new schedule would no longer be changed, so it is still set to be implemented on the first of next month.</p>

<p>Rain and Snow Fell, Damaging Crops</p>
<p>Since spring entered in this port, the climate has changed. Yesterday, rain and snow fell, and it was as cold as deep winter. The Celsius temperature was only 39 degrees. According to the astronomical observatory report, since spring entered, there have been strong winds and heavy rains and very cold weather in the provinces along the Yangtze River. Generally, farmers are concerned that since spring entered, wheat seedlings have just sprouted. If the weather is not favorable, the crops will be damaged.

<p>As a Result of the Police Appeal</p>
<p>Li Minzhou, the Cantonese general manager of the New New Company, dismissed Zhou Zhanyuan, a Tianjin doorkeeper and deputy headman, for repeated mistakes (on the 1st of last month). As a result, Zhou used a pistol to kill Li in room 327 of the New New Hotel. Zhou was also arrested by the police and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and sentencing, where Zhou was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. The police did not accept the verdict and argued that Zhou's killing of Li was actually premeditated. Therefore, the police lawyer Gan Jingxian listed the circumstances of premeditated murder and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. After the Second Branch of the Higher Court concluded the interrogation, the sentencing had been awaited. As reported in this newspaper many times, yesterday afternoon, Zhao Zhengjing, the presiding judge of the Higher Court Branch, along with two associate judges, Lin and Zhou, ascended to the first criminal court and announced the verdict, revoking the original verdict. Zhou Zhanyuan was sentenced to death for premeditated murder. One pistol and two bullets were confiscated.</p>

<p>Chen Had a Nephew Currently Studying at a Catholic Church</p>
<p>A Small Iron Hammer with Blood Stains Was Found Near the Body</p>
<p>Chen Zhongxin, a 26-year-old Cantonese man residing in the French Concession at No. 2, Wufeng Lane, Xiafei Road, above the Huaan Western Restaurant, was invited out on the morning of the day before yesterday around 8:00 AM. At noon, he was lured to the upper floor of No. 28, Baoren Lane, No. 697, west of the intersection of Xiafei Road and Masnan Road. The assailant used an iron hammer to injure Chen's head, causing his death. Afterwards, the assailant, intending to destroy the body, eliminate traces, and deceive others, wrapped the corpse in all the clothes and bedding, sprinkled it with kerosene, and set it on fire. The assailant then took the opportunity to escape. The fire was discovered by the second landlord, a Russian woman named Youli Aifu (transliteration), and the waiter Chen Nianshi, who alerted the fire brigade, drove to extinguish the blaze, and found the body. The police transported it to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Examination Office to await the autopsy. Details of the situation were published in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that at the time, detectives found a small wooden-handled iron hammer near the body, with the handle covered in bloodstains, and took it back to the police station. They also discovered that the deceased had a nephew, Chen Tianbao, who is 20 years old this year and is currently studying at the seminary in the Tushanwan Catholic Church in Xujiahui. He has no other relatives in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, the police ordered detectives to bring the corpse's nephew, the second landlord Russian woman, the waiter, and others in for questioning. At the same time, they reported to the Second Special District District Court. Chief Prosecutor Chen Beisan, along with a forensic doctor and clerk, arrived at noon to examine the body. They ascended to the court and, according to the reports from Chinese and Western detectives regarding the investigation after the incident, presented the murder weapon as evidence. The official questioned the corpse's relatives and witnesses about the circumstances of the discovery and then pronounced that Chen Zhongxin had indeed died from injuries sustained before his death. Chen Tianbao claimed the body for burial, pending the police's arrest of the murderer to be brought to justice. The iron hammer was kept on file for future reference.</p>

<h3 id="e169">The Loan Office for Fishermen of Shangbao and Nine Other Counties Begins Granting Loans <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Notice to Fishermen to Go and Register</p>
<p>The Loan Office for Fishermen of Shangbao, Jinchuan, Nanqi, Chongfeng, Tai and Nine other counties was formally established in Songjiang on the 26th. The office yesterday notified all fishermen to go and register immediately in order to start receiving loans. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Start of Loans: The total amount of fishermen's loans in Jiangsu Province is 2.5 million, which has been fully raised by the office's chief director, Yan Hao, and reported to the Ministry of Industry and the Construction Department of Jiangsu Province for approval. The funds have been entrusted to the Shanghai Guohua Bank for safekeeping in order to facilitate lending. A reporter from the Dagong News visited the office's director, Zhao Enpu, who said that the office was specifically established to provide relief to fishermen. Each county is allocated a loan amount of 50,000 yuan. However, the loan procedure requires fishermen to submit a registration form, which will be verified by the office. Once the fishermen have found a guarantor, they can borrow. These loans are interest-free and repaid in installments. However, those who have not registered and been approved by this office are not allowed to borrow. Furthermore, the fishermen of Shangbao, Chongming, Jinshan, and Baoshan counties have already come to negotiate and have been approved to establish branch offices. For the other five counties, it is hoped that those familiar with the local fishing conditions will come to the office to negotiate so that branch offices can be established and loans can be started.</p>
<p>Notice of Registration: The Loan Office for Fishermen of Shangbao and nine other counties yesterday notified the fishermen of each county: "For the purpose of notification, this office has raised funds to establish a fishermen's loan office with the aim of developing the fishing industry. The nine-county fishermen's loan office has been surveyed and located at Zhongxin Road, Wai Ma Road, Wusong. It was formally established on the 26th of this month and will immediately begin investigating the conditions of fishermen in each county. All fishermen are requested to come to the office quickly to register so that loan disbursement can be opened. This matter concerns the livelihoods of fishermen and the development of the fishing industry. Please do not hesitate and delay, lest you regret it later. This notice is hereby given. Director Zhao Enpu."</p>
<h3 id="e170">A Large-Scale Red Pill Operation Busted Above the Shenfeng Fruit Store on Henan Road <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Over Five Thousand Six Hundred Taels of Red Pills and Pill Blocks Seized</p>
<p>Raw Materials, Machines, Etc. are Larger in Scale Than Other Places</p>
<p>Zhang Shiliang, Who Trafficked in Red Pills, Was Intercepted En Route</p>
<p>Lu Liankui, the Chinese Inspector of the Narcotics Department of the General Police Station, learned that Zhang Shiliang, a native of this county, specializes in trafficking red pill drugs. Yesterday afternoon at 12:30 PM, he was again transporting a large batch of red pills and had to pass through the intersection of Henan Road and Tianjin Road. Therefore, he ordered Chinese Detective Liu Shaokui, Song Bingzheng, Detective Zhang Yunhong, and Bao Detective Xu Guirong to go to the address to wait. Before long, Zhang arrived slowly and was arrested by the detectives who stepped forward. Over thirty bags of red pills were seized, weighing a total of 186 taels, and taken back to the police station. Under strict questioning, Zhang confessed that the main red pill manufacturing operation was located on the fourth floor of the Shenfeng Fruit Store, No. 437 Henan Road. Therefore, the original team of detectives rushed there and saw a Wufeng Hardware Store sign hanging on the fourth floor of the building. The doors were tightly closed, and no one was inside. The detectives then managed to open the window and enter, seeing that the interior was divided into three rooms. The front room was the office, the middle room was the red pill manufacturing workshop, and the back room was the pill drying area. Approximately 5,600 taels of red pills and pill blocks, as well as raw materials, machines, etc., were seized, the number of which is unknown. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Division One Court of the First Special District Court. Li Zhishan, the police lawyer, stated that the manufacturing operation in this case was larger in scale than other operations that had been busted, and even the pill drying equipment was better than other places. Because the main culprit is at large, the police are currently hunting him down. Therefore, he requested a postponement of the trial. Zhang Shiliang confessed during questioning that he worked as a tea boy in the operation, specializing in cleaning. Yesterday, he was ordered by the owner to carry things outside. The rest of his confession was evasive. Criminal Division One Court President Feng Shide verified the confession and then ordered the case to be adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e171">The Municipal Bureau of Public Works Schedules the Operation of Public Buses <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Service from Old West Gate to Longhua to Begin on April 1</p>
<p>The Full-Route Fare is Estimated to be 48 Copper Coins</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Works, having been ordered to prepare for the operation of public buses in South Shanghai, has completed preparations. With the Longhua Incense Festival approaching rapidly, in order to facilitate the citizens, it has been decided that the first public bus route, from the Old West Gate to Longhua, will begin service on April 1. The full-route fare is estimated to be 48 copper coins. It is also heard that once all the vehicles ordered from the Arnhold &amp; Co. have been delivered, the bureau will add two lines: a cross-city line and a ring road line.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the Shanghai South Public Bus Company was affected by the January 28th Incident and declared liquidation, all the former employees of the company petitioned the party and government organs, requesting that if the South Shanghai Public Bus service were to resume in the future, they should be given priority for employment. Subsequently, although some businessmen requested to establish the business, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works did not approve it because the conditions were not met, and many of the former employees were unable to return to their jobs. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works, considering that the operation of the South Shanghai Public Bus service is of great importance to transportation, decided to take over the operation of the South Shanghai Public Bus service under municipal management. Internal arrangements have been completed, and the opening is imminent. Although the former employees petitioned the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Party Committee to be employed, they have not yet received any concrete results. With the resumption of the public bus service imminent, three representatives, Qian Shun’gao and others, went to the Municipal Government again yesterday afternoon to petition. Zhu Weiyao, a clerk from the Second Section of the Municipal Government, received them. Clerk Zhu said that the matter had not yet been reported by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, and it was difficult to give a concrete instruction in fact. He promised that the Municipal Government would order the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to investigate and handle the matter. The representatives, who had been unemployed for a long time and were forced by their livelihood, requested that they be reinstated in accordance with the previously signed contract. Clerk Zhu also promised that the Municipal Government would order the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to investigate and handle the matter within the possible range. The representatives were satisfied and then left.</p>

<h3 id="e176">An Incredibly Tragic Murder Case <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>How Zhang Zhanggen Died, Lu Linqing is Likely a Suspect</p>
<p>Zhang Zhanggen, from Zhangjiazhai, Beixing Township, Gaoqiao, Pudong, used to be a copper worker in the Wusong Railway Factory and was quite close to Lu Linqing, a fellow worker in the factory. Later, Zhang Zhanggen resigned because he was on bad terms with the foreman, Liu Changshun, and helped out in a copper shop in Hongkou. Lu Linqing was sentenced to imprisonment for political suspicion and was not released until the winter of last year. Zhang Zhanggen asked someone to intercede, intending to return to the factory to work, but before it could be achieved, he suddenly met Lu Linqing in Hongkou last year. Upon seeing each other, Lu asked Zhang if he recognized him. Zhang replied that he had not seen him for several years and could not help but feel unfamiliar. Lu said that he heard that you wanted to return to the factory, is that true? Zhang replied that he had, but it had not been achieved. Lu asked Zhang to find another good job, and Zhang did not mind. After Zhang returned home, he told his wife, Zhang Ling, that he had met his colleague Lu Linqing. However, on the 19th day of the first lunar month of this year, Zhang Zhanggen went to a friend's house in Hongkou, but for some reason, he did not return home. On the 21st, he went to Wusong, and on the evening of the 22nd, Lu Linqing suddenly came to Zhang's house and said, "Your husband, Zhang Zhanggen, went to Songjiang and died suddenly at my house." When Ling heard this, she immediately rushed to Lu Linqing's house in Wusong with her aunt, Huang Zhang. She saw her husband's body covered with a quilt in the bed. Ling wanted to lift the quilt to see, but Lu stopped her from doing so. At that time, Lu said that his fellow workers in the factory had raised more than 50 yuan and had to collect the body. Zhang's sister, Huang Zhang, insisted on lifting the quilt to see, but Lu's family was large, and they were all violently blocked. Until the time of the funeral, Zhang Ling had already fainted from crying. Huang Zhang glanced at her younger brother, Zhang Zhanggen, whose face was as if he were alive, but she found a cyan-purple color below his ears, and his whole body was covered in cyan swelling. She was about to take a closer look, but the coffin was already closed. Lu ordered Ling to transport the coffin back to the village for burial. At that time, the wife and other female family members were ignorant and were oppressed by Lu and did not dare to speak out. Later, after inquiring, she learned that her husband, Zhang Zhanggen, was actually beaten to death by Lu Linqing and others in a premeditated manner. She wanted to seek redress, but she had no money. Until the day before yesterday, because of the sale of the land, she went to the Fourth Precinct of the Third District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. After the director of the precinct, Zhan Chun, inquired about her husband, Ling thought that there was an opportunity to take advantage of, so she told how her husband, Zhang Zhanggen, was premeditatedly beaten to death by Lu Linqing, and how she was not allowed to see, and how her aunt, Huang Zhang, noticed it, and how she was trying to seek redress. After Director Zhan took the confession, he immediately conducted an investigation and found that Zhang Zhanggen had indeed died unjustly. Therefore, he secretly sent detectives to arrest Lu Linqing and bring him to the precinct. Lu confessed that Zhang's death had nothing to do with him. The rest of his confession was evasive. Considering the seriousness of the case, he was sentenced to be transferred to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Afternoon Visit to the Two Newspapers</p>
<p>Received an Excellent Impression</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Aimin, Manager of the Singapore Sin Chew Jit Poh, was commissioned by Mr. Hu Wenhu to return to China for inspection. The task is extremely important. Since Mr. Lin's arrival in Shanghai, he has been very busy with social engagements. Yesterday afternoon, Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao held a banquet for him at the Hua An Restaurant on the eighth floor, and invited Hu Guigeng, Liu Shimu, Huang Jingwan, and Lang Jingshan to accompany him. More than ten people attended, including the owners of the two newspapers, Zhang Yunhe, Wang Boqi, Ma Yinliang, Wu Tingchen, Hu Zhongchi, Huang Jiping, Gu Angruo, and Wang Weizhen. During the meal, they discussed in detail the political and economic hardships experienced by overseas Chinese in Nanyang in recent years, and the urgent need for the government to find ways to provide relief to ensure the inherent status of overseas Chinese. After the meal, Mr. Lin and others visited the various departments of Shen Bao, and at four o'clock they went to the Xinwen Bao building, where Mr. Wang Boqi personally guided and explained in detail. Mr. Lin expressed his satisfaction with the substantial completeness of the two newspapers, saying that the domestic news industry has made rapid progress and can serve as a model for overseas newspaper operators. He was particularly pleased to have gained an excellent impression on this return to China.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Notice on Burial of Coffins Along the Roads in the Third District, Fifth Precinct <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Director Wang Extends Kindness to Withered Bones</p>
<p>All Families Should Claim and Bury Their Own</p>
<p>Wang Junfu, Director of the Fifth Precinct of the Third District of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau in Donggou, issued a notice because there were too many coffins exposed on the Gaolu and Luxing roads that needed to be buried urgently. The notice stated that it was being issued because the Bureau had repeatedly received instructions from the Public Security and Health Bureau regarding the numerous exposed coffins in the four townships under the jurisdiction of the Precinct, ordering the families to bury them by a deadline. Notifications had been posted and the families had been informed. An investigation revealed that in the Gaolu and Luxing areas under the jurisdiction of the Precinct, excluding the 43rd map area of the Luxing District, which was buried last winter in conjunction with the Municipal Affairs Office under the supervision of the police, there were still no fewer than several thousand coffins exposed. The exposed coffins had not been buried for a long time, and the stench of the corpses, due to being exposed to rain and sun, inevitably spread far and wide with the wind. If burial was further delayed, once the summer season arrived, the weather would become warmer, and there was a deep fear that an epidemic would break out, which would be greatly detrimental to hygiene. Therefore, strict measures were being taken to eliminate hidden dangers. The public was hereby notified that from this day forward until April 15, they must inform each other to have the families bury the coffins by the deadline. As the Spring Festival was a time when agricultural work was not pressing, if any delays were arbitrarily made, regardless of whether the coffins were claimed or unclaimed, the Precinct would supervise the local Baojia heads to hire workers to bury them on the spot without using lime. If the floating coffin was located in a certain place, it would be buried there by digging a hole more than six feet deep. However, the Precinct did not have many police officers, so it was planned to start from the Xigou to Jiebang Dugaolu area on one side, and from Donggou to Gaohang Dajiangpu, Zhangjiaqiao Shangchuan Automobile Road, and Pudong Avenue on the other. First, the coffins on both sides of the road, which were visible to passers-by, would be buried, and then the other remote and desolate places, or the sides of isolated villages and wild shops, and the deep and secluded places in the fields, would be buried as much as possible to complete this task, so as to emphasize hygiene and improve the city's appearance. In addition to ordering the heads of each map area to prepare for implementation without the slightest delay, the public was hereby notified to strictly comply and bury the coffins quickly. This notice is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>Since the Tuberculosis Prevention Association launched its fundraising campaign, donations from all parties have been extremely enthusiastic. After the Association's Honorary President Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet and immediately pledged to donate 5,000 yuan, Mrs. Xiao Zhiji raised 500 yuan. Wen Lantting, Wang Yiting, Chu Bu Sun, Sun Weiru, Gu Xinyi, and Mu Ouchu raised 2,000 yuan through the Joint Association of Exchange, and recently, Ms. Ding Shujing raised nearly 100 yuan. It is now reported that Du Yuesheng, Shi Liangcai, Wang Yansong, Rong Zongjing, and Wu Daquan, in view of the seriousness of tuberculosis in China, believe that it is not enough to save this declining nation without paying special attention to prevention. Therefore, each has begun to solicit donations from all parties, striving to achieve the Association's budgeted goals in the shortest possible time. It is estimated that the Association's three-year plan requires more than 200,000 yuan to carry out national tuberculosis prevention education and build sanatoriums, prevention centers, children's summer camps, and free clinics. It is hoped that those at home and abroad who are concerned about saving themselves and others will pay attention to this cause and enthusiastically contribute.</p>

<p>The loading and unloading of goods at Ronglin Warehouse in Pudong's Nanmatou has been contracted by Li Hongji. The work has been ongoing since 1928 for seven years. Unexpectedly, in October of last year, the warehouse manager, Ling Jitan, suddenly advertised for bids again. At that time, Li Hongji sought to recover more than 10,000 yuan in unpaid wages from the warehouse, which led to a dispute. The Social Bureau intervened to mediate, resolving to abolish the contract system but allowing the original workers to continue working and signing a draft agreement. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. When the Chunhe ship officially started work on December 13th, the warehouse paid 4 jiao and 6 fen per ton. However, for the second and third shipments, the warehouse only paid 3 jiao and 8 fen per ton. As a result, the workers protested en masse. At the same time, Li Hongji pursued the more than 10,000 yuan in unpaid wages, further escalating the dispute. The warehouse was forced to petition the Social Bureau to suspend work and invited Xie Peide, General Manager of the Yitaixing Nan Warehouse, to mediate. The two sides agreed on a number of conditions, and the warehouse then extended Xie's term as Ronglin's agent and scheduled to resume work on the fifth day of the first lunar month this year, but the results have not yet been implemented, and the warehouse has been shut down to this day. At about 7:00 a.m. yesterday morning, the warehouse suddenly petitioned the Public Security Bureau, saying that troublemakers were preventing the resumption of work. Bureau Chief Wen, according to the petition, immediately ordered Yuan, the captain of the Second Brigade of the Police Corps, to lead a number of armed policemen to protect the resumption of work. The warehouse then hired more than 200 workers from various places and began work. Upon hearing the news, Li Hongji immediately sent a representative, Qiu Xin, along with more than a dozen workers to Captain Yuan to explain the situation. The captain said that Qiu's statement seemed reasonable, but he was under orders from his superiors to protect the resumption of work, and he should obey the order. As for the wage dispute, he was instructed to appeal to higher authorities. It is reported that Li Hongji has decided to request relief from the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Headquarters.</p>

<p>Prostitute Escapes the Brothel With Tears After Three Months</p>
<p>Xiao Laobazi, surnamed Lu, now named Taohua, is 17 years old and from Gaoyou. In the first month of this year, she was forced into prostitution by her mother, Lu Zhang, and brother, Lu Yongchang, who sold her for 320 yuan to a brothel at No. 19 Hengcang Lane, opposite the Great World. Because she was forced to receive customers and often abused by the madam, Zhu Han, her young and weak body could not resist. A customer, out of humanity, hinted at a way out and wrote a letter for her. Taohua personally affixed her fingerprint and sent it directly to the China Tzu Yu Association requesting relief. Upon receiving the letter, the association sent personnel to investigate and confirmed the facts. The association then sent letters to the Second Special District Court and the Central Police Station of the French Concession, requesting that they immediately order the arrest of all involved. The next day, the letters were executed, and Zhu Han, Lu Zhang, Lu Yongchang, Lu Xiao Laobazi, and all the witnesses were arrested and taken to the police station. The court opened on March 23, and Zhao Jian was sent by the Tzu Yu Association to testify in court. As a result, Lu Zhang was sentenced to three months in prison, Zhu Han to two months, and Lu Yongchang to one month. Lu Xiao Laobazi was sent to the Charity Home for education.</p>

<p>Zhou Zhijiang's Shares and Loans Are Nowhere to Be Found</p>
<p>Huang Miao, a Cantonese lawyer and principal of Zhengfeng Middle School on Gordon Road, previously raised funds to establish the Shanghai Huangke Gymnasium, with Huang serving as the director. In December of the year before last, Zhou Zhijiang, a local resident living at No. 166 Fumin Road in Nanshi, was invited by Huang to work in the general affairs department of the gymnasium, with an agreed monthly salary of 100 yuan. At that time, Huang also asked Zhou to join the share capital with 3,000 yuan. Because Zhou could not raise a large sum of money at once, he gave Huang Miao a receipt in his own name, measuring one mu, four fen, seven li, and seven hao of land, to mortgage for 3,000 yuan at Ma Sude's Dahuapropety CO. in Nanjing Road Continental Commerical Mart as share capital. Unexpectedly, Huang privately mortgaged it to Ma for 8,000 yuan without notifying Zhou. It was not until May of last year that Ma Sude urged Huang to redeem the receipt because it had not been redeemed. Zhou heard about it and learned the truth. He negotiated with Zhang and immediately gave Zhou Zhijiang an IOU for 5,000 yuan. Zhou also affixed a seal on the mortgage receipt. Unexpectedly, not long after, Huang suddenly transferred the gymnasium to someone else and renamed it Shanghai Gymnasium, so that Zhou's shares and loans were nowhere to be found. The monthly salary checks he received were also not cashed. Recently, mortgagee Ma Sude sued Zhou in the court for ignoring the mortgage loan. Zhou also hired lawyer Wu Peng to accuse lawyer Huang Miao of embezzlement in the Second Special District Court. He had been summoned once, but because the defendant Huang Miao lived at No. 4434 Yuqing Lane, Roberts Road, Public Concession, he was not under jurisdiction, and he made a statement. Therefore, the Second Special District Court ruled that it had no jurisdiction and that the case should be transferred to the First Special District Court for trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Xiangzu presided over the second criminal court to summon him. The defendant Huang Miao did not appear, and his brother submitted a statement to the court, stating that Huang had gone to Jiangxi for something and requested a postponement. The plaintiff's attorney, Wu Peng, then stated that Huang was deliberately evading and requested permission to issue a warrant for his arrest. Judge Wu instructed that the case be postponed to the afternoon of April 9 for further summoning the defendant to the court for questioning.</p>

It is praised for its ability to diagnose pregnancy using the latest methods and to distinguish the fetal heart sounds of boys and girls. Therefore, pregnant women who want to know whether the baby they will give birth to in the future is a boy or a girl, as well as those with amenorrhea who are seemingly pregnant or not pregnant, and those who vomit uncontrollably during pregnancy, often seek treatment and can achieve satisfactory results. The director of the hospital apologizes and has used heavy funds to hire Wang Qili, a well-known female uterine disease expert from Hong Kong, to Shanghai. The doctor specializes in painless childbirth and menstrual regulation for pregnant women and has a long-standing reputation in Nanhua. She has arrived in Shanghai and will start seeing patients at the hospital on April 1.</p>
<p>Another Effective Traditional Chinese Medicine Invention: In recent years, people in China have been using science to study traditional Chinese medicine and inventing various effective drugs. Recently, Mr. Ni Wending, a well-known surgical expert in Junyi Lane, Beiler Road, invented a lotion to treat goose palm wind based on his experience. It is said that the medicine is not only effective quickly, but also can never recur, which is especially valuable. Goose palm wind is a stubborn disease, and there is no specific treatment in the Chinese and Western medical circles, so it is regarded as an incurable disease. Now that Mr. Ni has made this invention, it will not only benefit patients greatly, but also have a significant impact on the Chinese people's trust in traditional Chinese medicine. It is said that it is sold in major pharmacies in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e197">"The Uselessness of Calligraphy" <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>丨Reply to Mr. Wang Zuming丨</p>
<p>In many reading plans sent in by readers, we see "calligraphy" as an item, taking up a lot of time. We also read at the beginning and end of readers' letters how readers humbly admit their "calligraphy" is not good, repeatedly asking for our forgiveness. In fact, these letters are all written very neatly, even the editor's painstaking efforts cannot write like that. This indeed shows how much readers value calligraphy. They sincerely want to learn it, listing it as an important subject, taking up half of their self-study time? For example, Mr. Wang Zuming is a shop assistant, with only two hours of spare time each day. His self-study course is one hour of reading and one hour of writing. Because he is practicing large characters, he also needs to grind ink before "writing". However, Mr. Wang does not have this time. His only solution is to use the hour of reading to grind ink while reading. In this way, it is clear that the focus is on "writing" that "Magu Altar", and the efficiency of reading will naturally decrease.</p>
<p>We are not surprised by this phenomenon, nor do we object to everyone being able to write beautiful characters. We know that there are other reasons for this trend, and we cannot blindly agree with or oppose it.</p>
<p>However, spending a lot of time on writing is always a pity, and it is also the most uneconomical plan for amateur self-study. Since you have unconsciously raised this question to us, we naturally cannot remain silent and must treat it as a serious issue and bring it to everyone's attention.</p>
<p>"Writing" has always occupied a very important position in the eyes of the Chinese. On the one hand, it is a subtle trick for the rulers to wear down the energy of intellectuals, making them forget more important "national affairs" in this small skill, just like women's foot binding, which makes them lose their resistance. On the other hand, it is because Chinese characters do not get rid of pictograms, calligraphy has become a kind of art, becoming a personal enjoyment for the literati and officials, and a sustenance for "cultivating the mind". It can indeed be said that it occupied a considerable position in feudal art.</p>
<p>In the past twenty years, the status of calligraphy has gradually declined. This is a natural trend. Although writing is still listed as a subject in today's primary schools, its purpose is clearly different from before. We no longer have the leisure to waste on this "art" because there are too many things we need to know, which are much more important than writing.</p>
<p>However, despite this, society still retains a fascination with this "art". This is a conservative mentality, especially in places like "government offices" and the business world, where they still pay attention to the handwriting of low-level staff and maintain the concept of valuing calligraphy, which forms the basis of an important item in the reading plans of many of our readers. As for new-style large companies, they are increasingly using typewriters, and even employees are using pencils for daily use, and they don't pay much attention to calligraphy.</p>
<p>Chinese calligraphy will inevitably become an unimportant skill as social life becomes increasingly complex. As long as it is clear, easy to recognize, and quick to use, it is enough. The only people who truly enjoy it as an art are probably people like Zheng Xiaoxu? The above said a lot of idle words, but it is not completely useless for you. You inevitably have unclear understanding in your concepts, and you are still wasting time on this course that does not require much effort. Although we want to protest, if we do not liberate you from the conceptual aspect, we are afraid that we will not be able to convince you!</p>
<p>For the needs of your work, you can practice writing in your reading notes, correspondence, and shop duties. It is really not worth spending half of your time specifically practicing writing! According to our experience, there is no need to write "Magu Altar" characters in stores now, and skilled skills are enough.</p>
<p>There is much more knowledge that is more important than this "calligraphy" and more closely related to your life. As mentioned earlier, there is really a lot of it. Speaking of business, can you all understand the phenomena in today's market? Can your abilities cope with it easily? Can these aspects be dealt with by someone who can only write a good hand?</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that readers who list writing as an important subject will quickly change their views, make some revisions to their reading plans, reduce writing time, and add the subjects you need more, and don't waste your time.</p>
<p>In addition, for all of you who ask about "calligraphy", such as asking: "Is it better for me to learn Yan style or Liu style?" or "Should I copy inscriptions or 'trace帖'?" and "How to increase the effectiveness of calligraphy learning?" etc., the editor will not answer them in the future, because the editor believes that this is not the knowledge that everyone needs, and the editor personally does not have as much knowledge in this area as Zheng Xiaoxu and others. I don't want to talk about it myself, and I don't dare to talk about it either.</p>
<p>Chunqiu</p>
<h3 id="e198">I Have a Few Words to Say (Part 1) <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>In this day and age, everything has to change. Some turn to the right; some turn to the left; some turn and go straight to the top; some turn and go straight to hell. I, the editor of this "Chunqiu", don't want anything else, just want to turn into the eyes of most readers, and get most readers to say it's good. Then I would be like when I was a child at the sugar figurine stall, turning that small wheel, turning smoothly to a very big and good sugar Buddha head.</p>
<p>How should the "Chunqiu" be transformed? Looking at the position it occupies, it is only a quarter of a full page, just like a small court in the southeast. And it is still occupied by an advertisement in one corner, as if the four eastern provinces were lost on the map of the Republic of China. I ask, with these small positions, how can it be arranged to look good? I thought hard for a day and finally drew a picture. At first glance, it looks like a theater. The title of "Chunqiu" at the high end of the center is like a stage; the two large special positions on both sides are like two large flower buildings; the remaining three rows of ordinary positions, large and small, are like the main hall of a government office, and the long row at the bottom that specializes in "Whereabouts" "World Oddities" and other positions, that is the moon building. Since the style of "Chunqiu" is like a theater, then all the contributors are super-class celebrities, and all the works are signature plays. As for me, I am just a stage manager hiding behind the scenes. Sometimes I come on stage to show my face, but I am just jumping around as an official.</p>
<p>Our original first position often published works like editorials. It is impossible to talk about society without a head or brain; it is inconvenient to talk about national affairs, and there are many obstacles. If we specialize in empty talk without touching the edge, we are afraid that we will inevitably be blamed for the pure talk of the Jin people. According to history, the Jin Dynasty perished because of pure talk, so it is written in large letters that pure talk misleads the country. How can this small "Chunqiu" bear the crime of misleading the country, so I plan to give up this empty talk article from now on.</p>
<p>Since we don't want empty talk articles, then what do we want? Look! It is the opposite of empty talk. We want substantial articles that describe and depict a wonderful fact in economical words. When you contributors write, please do a clean-up campaign for all clichés and all nonsense, and get rid of them completely; each article should be limited to 400 words. After you finish writing the article, please be kind and move the abacus to calculate the number of words in the whole article, and note it on the manuscript paper. Please don't forget it. As for other odds and ends, as long as they are witty and meaningful, even if there are only a few dozen words, we will welcome them very much.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Japanese Pen Shops in Shanghai <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>In the Hongkou area of Shanghai, there are several Japanese-run calligraphy brush shops. All the Japanese people in Shanghai buy their calligraphy brushes from shops run by their own people, and they are determined not to go to our country's brush shops as customers. This is because their patriotism is strong, which is very admirable. However, according to Mr. Li, a friend of mine who has been making brushes for generations, the brushes in Japanese shops are not made by themselves, but are sold by Huzhou Shanlian Town, which is famous for Hu brushes. They are actually our country's goods, not their country's goods. I think everyone will laugh when they know this secret.</p>
<p>Therefore, I also thought of something more ridiculous and despicable: There is a famous calligrapher in Shanghai. If you go to his calligraphy room, you will see dozens or hundreds of large, medium, and small brushes hanging on the wall. Each brush has Japanese characters engraved on it. He said that he is used to using Japanese brushes in his life. If he uses domestic goods, he can hardly write a word. Therefore, he always goes to Japanese brush shops to buy or order them, and he is not willing to go to brush shops opened by Chinese people as a customer. Think about it, the brushes in Japanese brush shops are Hu brushes from Shanlian Town, Huzhou. Isn't it ridiculous? And he is addicted to using foreign goods, isn't it even more despicable?</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that everyone will not think that just because the Japanese also sell our country's goods, we will also sell Japanese goods; don't think that just because the Japanese still go to Japanese shops to buy our brushes, I will also go to shops run by Chinese people to buy Japanese goods. I also hope that the famous calligrapher will quickly change that ridiculous and despicable bad habit.</p>

<p>An advertising agency's agent tried his best to solicit a female food store merchant for his company. But this female merchant did not believe in the effectiveness of newspaper advertising.</p>
<p>Soon this agent thought of a way to say to this female merchant:</p>
<p>"You certainly know how a hen lays eggs; it crows and crows: cluck, cluck, cluck! ... Don't you see a duck laying eggs? When a duck lays eggs, it hides them and doesn't let people know. But a hen will loudly report to the public that it has laid an egg. The silent duck hides itself without making a sound and doesn't let people know it is laying eggs. What do you see as a result? You certainly know that the demand for eggs is extremely high, and the whole world welcomes them. Look at duck eggs again, there is very little demand for them, and almost no one knows about them. This is the effectiveness of advertising that you cannot deny."</p>

<p>— Wuliao Ke</p>
<p>Overview of Duan Inkstones</p>
<p>(Geng) Stone Eyes Former people discussed inkstones, some considered those with eyes to be valuable, while others considered those with eyes to be flawed. Both are biased opinions. Generally speaking, good eyes are enough to attract people's aesthetic interest, while bad eyes are disgusting. If the stone is tender and moist, the eyes must be fresh and alive, which is a good eye. If the stone is dry and old, the eyes must be gray and yellow, which is a bad eye. Good eyes are also considered to be high eyes, while bad eyes are considered to be low eyes. Later people have all advocated this way of discussing eyes. Among the good eyes, the best are those that are round, upright, bright, and beautiful, with five-colored halos up to ten or more layers or eight or nine layers, and the pupils are fresh and alive, which are truly priceless. In addition, it is extremely rare to have multiple eyes arranged on the inkstone, such as the Big Dipper or the shape of a five-star heart. Shi Yin's discussion of stone eyes in the Inkstone Talk is more comprehensive. It is recorded below:</p>
<p>The eyes of the lower rock stone are called starling eyes, the upper rock and lower hole are called parrot eyes, the upper rock and upper middle hole are called rooster and cat eyes (those with pupils in a straight line are cat eyes), and the half wall is called sparrow eyes and myna eyes. The locals distinguish them in this way. It is also said that Duan has starling eyes, and also has crow eyes and elephant eyes. Yellow is called crow, and blue-green is called starling. The eyes are not valued for being yellow. Round ones are starlings and have crows, and long ones are elephant eyes. The eyes are not valued for being long. There are three kinds of eyes. Those with many halos and are refined and clear are called living eyes. Those that are hazy and dull are called teary eyes. Those that are scorched yellow inside and outside are called dead eyes. (Some people also say that those with large outlines are angry eyes, those with blurred halos are cloudy eyes, and those with white spots in the halos are blind eyes. They are all not top-grade.) The Duan people say that the stone is tender, then there are many eyes, and the stone is old, then there are few eyes. Tender stones are moist, fine, and produce ink, so it is valuable to have eyes.</p>
<p>There are also red eyes, round like coral bird eyes, and green eyes that are tight, small, and have no pupils, which are all inferior products.</p>
<p>Former people also said that those with green veins must have eyes, and there are many green veins in waist stones and foot stones. The green veins are also called eye tendons. Then what are the green veins? We carefully study them. All the green and green expressions of the lower rock stone are expressions of green veins. The Duan people call those that do not form eye patterns emerald patterns. The Hanmo Talk of Mr. Inukai Yan Bokudo of Japan says that eyes without pupils and small ones are mung bean eyes, small ones of mung bean eyes are emerald patterns, and small ones of emerald patterns are blue flowers, and small ones of blue flowers are fine dust, goose down, ant feet, etc. It can be seen that the so-called eyes, the so-called emerald patterns, and the so-called various blue flowers, although the names are different, their essence is the same. Bando's theory that the constituent molecules of blue flowers and eyes are all aggregates of diabase (see the previous discussion on blue flowers) is especially sufficient to be a proof for our explanation of green veins.</p>

<p>Chapter 26: Generously Expressing Patriotic Sentiments, Forgetting the Home and Serving the Country; Sadly Facing the Jade Mirror, Lamenting My Longing for People</p>
<p>Tian Qing smiled and said: Not only will he pass through Beiping, but he may also pass through Haidian. You can send a letter home by wild goose. Tian Qing was originally joking, but Zhao Ziqiang, upon hearing this, really felt a bit infatuated. He raised his head and looked towards the south where the goose flew, gazing blankly. The wild geese flew up very quickly. By the time he looked at them, he could not see even a black shadow in the sky. On this day, the dusk truly crossed over Haidian. At Zhao Ziqiang's home, not long after they had finished dinner, Yang Guizhi sat in the new room under the lamplight, finding an old sock of Ziqiang's and wanting to remake it for herself to wear. She sat quietly under the lamplight, paying attention to nothing. The flock of wild geese flying in the sky happened to make a few cooing sounds, sending that desolate sound into her ears, which made her heart pound involuntarily. She was also thinking like that, that these geese came from outside the customs. I don't know if they passed through Xifengkou? If they passed through Xifengkou, I don't know how our dear one would be foolishly thinking when he saw the wild geese flying south. While she was thinking, she unconsciously looked out the window and sighed, "Hai!" This long sigh was heard even by Zhao Weng, who was in the main room. But she had been married for a short time, and her husband had left, so the grievances in her belly were exactly Zhao's fault. As a father-in-law, what could he do to persuade her? At that time, he kept it in his heart and did not say anything. When he got up the next morning, he saw that Guizhi's eyes were red. Her eyelids were also a little swollen, which made him even more think that she had not slept well last night. In the morning, he proposed to Jiang that Guizhi was very upset, so let her go into the city to talk to Miss Huang, play for two days and come back. (248)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Sorrow of the Old Yellow Cow (Part 1) <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Mingdao</p>
<p>In the severe winter, the old yellow cow that had been raised at home for many years became ill; it was very ill, and even when given rice cakes, it spit them out without being able to swallow them.</p>
<p>A-shui Sheng sat in the house, holding a dry tobacco pipe, smoking it fiercely, and said to his old wife sitting next to him, "Niang, this old yellow cow is so sick, I'm afraid it won't get better. It has been doing extremely heavy work every year, after all, it is old, and it will definitely not be used for plowing in the coming year. If it dies, what will happen? I think it is better to sell it, we can recover some of the cost, and we have to pay a sum of membership money at the beginning of the first month. Although this year's harvest is good, we have reaped a lot, but it is worthless, and we still have to pay the rent for rice. We have wasted a year of blood and sweat, and we haven't made any more money. What should we use to pay the membership money to celebrate the New Year? So I decided to sell this old yellow cow." As he spoke, his attitude was very firm.</p>
<p>Niang was making rope next to him. After listening to her husband's words, she sighed and said, "We can't bear to sell this old yellow cow. I remember that we spent more than seventy yuan to buy it. Didn't I also take my very thick gold rings to the gold shop in the city to exchange for money to make up the numbers? It's a pity that it has helped us for so many years, and it's old; not only old, but also sick! That's right, we are also a lot older! Now, of course, we can only follow your words, sell it, and bring back some money; but next year when we plow the fields, we won't have this old yellow cow that has been with us for so many years, so what should we do? I don't have a second pair of gold rings to collect money to buy other plowing cattle." As she spoke, Niang's face was very gloomy, but she kept making her rope in her hands.</p>
<p>A-shui Sheng took a puff of his pipe, knocked the ashes off the ground, and pointed to Yinbao, who was playing with a puppy in the courtyard, and said, "Niang, this little girl is already twelve years old. Zhao, the head of the village at the bridge, likes her very much when he sees her. He told me that he wants Yinbao to be his family's adopted daughter-in-law. He is willing to pay me sixty yuan as a betrothal gift first. When Yinbao grows up, they will make the decision and choose a day for the wedding, and they will still allow us to go to the wedding feast. I think the Zhao family is a wealthy family. They have a lot of influence in the countryside. Zhao's third son, whose name is Bingsheng, is already fourteen years old and is studying in a foreign school in the local area. He is very handsome. If my family's Yinbao marries him, she will be blessed with good luck. As long as I give Zhao the head of the village a sound answer, I can get sixty yuan, and it will be better to buy a plowing cow. Isn't my idea very good?" Niang said, "It's good, but you actually treat Yinbao like an old yellow cow and sell her?" A-shui Sheng said: I have made up my mind to do this. The old yellow cow is sold to be killed, but Yinbao is sent to other people to have good luck. How can you compare people to cows?" After speaking, he smiled.</p>
<p>After the husband and wife made the decision, the old yellow cow was naturally sold. After A-shui Sheng had eaten his fill, he went out to contact the sale of the cow.</p>
<p>In the evening, Yinbao learned the news that the old yellow cow was going to be sold, and her heart became greatly disturbed. She asked her mother, "The old yellow cow is sick, which is pitiful. Why do we have to sell it?"</p>
<p>It is old, it can't do work, it can't plow the fields, and it is also suffering from illness, it definitely won't get better; so your father is going to sell it, get some money, and next year we will think of a way to buy a new, strong, young plowing cow to help us go to the fields to plow."</p>
<p>"Since the old yellow cow is old and sick and can no longer plow the fields, then what is the use of people buying it?" Yinbao asked, with a suspicious expression on her face.</p>
<p>Yinbao's mother smiled and said, "You don't know that the old yellow cow is sold to people to be killed. Don't you see the stewed beef sold in the market? They are all meat from these cows!"</p>
<p>"Ah! Is the old yellow cow sold to people to be killed?" A look of sadness appeared on Yinbao's face, and she questioned her mother as if she didn't believe it.</p>
<p>"Of course it is sold to people to be killed. It can't plow the fields, so what's the use of raising it? Your father also needs money." Her mother replied.</p>
<p>Yinbao heard this and burst into tears. She stamped her feet and cried, "The old yellow cow is my good friend. I take it out to play every day. It asks me for food, and I feed it straw. It knows me. When it's hot, my father takes it to the fields. It never stops working for a day. Now that it's sick, it will get better eventually. Why are you so cruel to sell it? Moreover, if it is sold out, people will kill it. Isn't it good to keep it at home?"</p>

<h3 id="e205">Overseas Chinese Demand That Our Country Withdraw from the Far Eastern Games <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Resolutely Oppose the Participation of the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Manila Special Telegram to the Chinese Athletic Association</p>
<p>Claiming to Allow Individual Participation is Extremely Absurd</p>
<p>The 10th Far Eastern Games. After our country resolutely refused the participation of the puppet organization, the Japanese side racked their brains again, trying to win over the Philippine side, and there was talk of a so-called China-Japan-Philippines roundtable meeting in Shanghai. The statement issued by our country's authorities implied that puppet country athletes would be allowed to participate individually. This is tantamount to a disguised form of tacit consent, and it is ridiculous to ask what country the nationality of the Far Eastern Games participants belongs to. Now, overseas Chinese, hearing about the puppet organization's desire to participate, are all indignant, and unanimously advocate resolutely refusing and advocating withdrawing from the Far Eastern Games. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent to the National Sports Association, which is forwarded by this newspaper. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Shen Bao, forwarded to the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation, on behalf of the overseas Chinese, we resolutely oppose the joining or participation of the puppet organization in the Far Eastern Games, and demand that our country immediately withdraw from the Far Eastern Games, Manila New China Daily.</p>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency, Manila, 28th) Dr. Yamamoto Tadaoki, who attended the Shanghai Roundtable Meeting to discuss the participation of the puppet state, and Kubota Kanzaburo, the representative of the puppet state, departed from Manila for Shanghai today, the 28th. In addition, the Philippine representative who attended the meeting, Professor Mandatan of the University of the Philippines, who represented the Philippines at the Pacific Conference last year, will depart for Shanghai a few days later, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Tilden and Vines Came to Shanghai and Demanded Rejection <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Tilden and others demanded 35,000 yuan</p>
<p>Rejected at the Annual General Meeting of the Lawn Tennis Club</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club held its annual general meeting this Tuesday afternoon at the West YMCA. Among the cases resolved, the most important was the overturning of the request for Tilden and Vines to come to Shanghai for a performance, because the amount was too large. The goal of Tilden and Vines was as high as 35,000 yuan, so it was rejected and not accepted. Therefore, will the world tennis kings not be seen this autumn? The club's staff has also been re-elected. The resolutions are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e207">Reject Tilden's Request <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The first thing proposed at the annual general meeting was the negotiation for Tilden and Vines to come to Shanghai for a performance this autumn. The amount requested by Tilden and Vines was as high as 35,000 yuan, and the performance period was two weeks. As a result of the discussion, everyone believed that the club's own economic strength could not guarantee this huge amount. If they wanted to raise this amount from ticket revenue, it would be extremely difficult, and the hope was very slim. Therefore, the request of the two was unanimously rejected.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Invite Japanese Players to Shanghai <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Secondly, Chairman Graham proposed that the club plans to invite outstanding players from neighboring Japan to come to Shanghai for a performance. The purpose is twofold: first, to improve the level of local tennis, and second, to obtain considerable subsidies for the club's own finances.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Inter-Port Players and Prizes <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The qualifications of inter-port players were discussed again. In order to avoid various complications and difficulties, players representing the port must reside in the local area for more than three months before they can be appointed. Again, regarding trophy prizes, in order to save expenses, the club's trophies will be changed to those purchased on order from now on, and the winners will be awarded with extremely small prizes.</p>

<p>As a result of the re-election of staff, Graham was re-elected as president, Shen Siliang and Grobas were re-elected as vice presidents, Secretary De Huili resigned, and Shi Ke continued. The following were elected as members of the five committees: Mei Hams, George, Tao Peng, Okamoto, Mo Que.</p>
<h3 id="e211">International Volleyball Opening Match: China Defeats Russia <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>43 to 27, Russia Recaptures One Game</p>
<p>United States Overwhelms Federation, 45 to 6</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Volleyball Tournament, organized by the West China YMCA, commenced at 7:15 PM last night in the YMCA basketball hall. The audience was sparse, and the atmosphere lacked enthusiasm. In the matches, the United States defeated the Federation in a one-sided contest, resulting in a score of 45 to 6. The match between China and Russia involved intense competition, with impressive performances from both sides, creating a tense atmosphere. Ultimately, China won only two games, securing a victory with a score of 43 to 27. The scores are detailed below:</p>
<p>United States (45) (15…1 15…2 15…3) (6) Federation</p>
<p>China (43) (15……10 13…15 15……2) (27) Russia</p>
<p>The match between China and Russia took place after the conclusion of the USA vs Federation match. The contest featured numerous highlights, with powerful spikes from both sides. Tenko Safi of the Russian team, with his tall stature, demonstrated exceptional spiking ability, truly being the cornerstone of the Russian team. Due to the balanced talent within the Chinese team, where each player excelled at spiking, they were ultimately able to overcome their formidable opponent. In the first game, the Russian team took an early lead, reaching a score of 10 to 9. Then, Wei Dingyi of the Chinese team served, achieving a series of successful points, turning the tide and securing a comeback victory. The second game was fiercely contested, with China gradually gaining the upper hand. However, after reaching a score of 13 to 10, China lost two serving opportunities, allowing Russia to win with a score of 15 to 13. In the final game, the Russian team collapsed, while the Chinese players unleashed powerful attacks from both sides, proving unstoppable, leading to a dominant victory with a score of 15 to 2. The absence of Qiu Guangxie from the Chinese team undoubtedly had an impact. The team rosters for both sides are listed below:</p>
<p>Chinese Team: Chen Baoqiu, Cai Tiange, Chen Zongqi, Cao Tingzan, Xu Heng, Wei Dingyi, Zhang Qunguang</p>
<p>Russian Team: Tenko Safi, Tasfu, Sha Luofei, Lu Simofan, Xie Jiufu Shi, Qiu Sifei</p>

<p>(Suzhou, 28th) The Zhijiang University basketball team arrived in Suzhou yesterday afternoon, staying at Soochow University. They competed against Soochow at 4 PM today. Referee Wang Shoufang initiated the game. For the first five minutes, neither side scored. Then, Zhijiang's Wang Pusheng scored several times. Afterwards, the competition between the two sides was fierce, but Soochow lacked coordination, allowing Zhijiang's Shi Hengyuan to score three out of three times, creating a score of 15 to 9, ending the first half. After the lemon break, they switched sides and continued the game. Soochow quickly caught up, taking advantage of their familiarity with the venue, and surged ahead, creating a score of 29 to 27. In the end, Zhijiang won. In terms of the skills of both teams, Zhijiang had effective front and back coordination, with excellent passing and shooting. Soochow had good activity under the basket, but their lack of coordination led to their defeat. Zhijiang is scheduled to leave for Nanjing at 9:50 AM tomorrow.</p>

However, the school, without prior approval from the Bureau, has arbitrarily enrolled students and started classes at 1034 Tangshan Road, using the school's name to attract students with the intention of deceiving them. This is highly inappropriate. The school is hereby ordered to immediately cease operations and report to the Bureau to uphold the law and avoid being shut down. This order is hereby issued.</p>

<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Due to the impact of the global economic recession, all countries are unanimously taking promoting their goods as the only way out. In addition to promoting goods, they are also building high tariff barriers to prevent the inflow of foreign goods. As a result, Country A defends against Country B, and Country B defends against Country C. To put it bluntly, they only want their goods to flow into other countries, and do not allow other countries' goods to be imported domestically. Look at the recent days, the Anglo-Japanese conference, the Anglo-French conference, as well as the British Parliament's urgency and the American people's panic, are all due to this problem. Among them, you tighten me, you are fierce, I am strong. The most pitiful is none other than our China, and the most deserving of death is none other than our national products industry. We do not have the right to set our own tariffs, and there is no way to ban foreigners from setting up factories. As a result, there is a trade deficit of 700 million yuan, and in the recent one or two months, the monthly trade deficit has been more than 100 million yuan. The dumping of Japanese goods is like mercury seeping into the ground, leaving no gap untouched. The tide-like influx of Japanese goods is just beginning. Not satisfied with dumping, they have recently taken action to set up factories extensively in China. One knife chokes the head, and another knife holds the wrist, and my dying national products industry has no possibility of resistance. This situation is not only pitiful, but also painful and sad. Those who run national product businesses suffer so much, but those in power have no intention of sympathizing, and impose heavy taxes, draining the pond to catch all the fish. The labor unrest that rises and falls from east to west is unfortunately triggered everywhere, strangling the industrial world to death. A certain gentleman said very sadly: "Running a national product factory is not something humans can do." What distressed words these are. Therefore, I do not hope for anything else, but hope that the government will quickly see the dangerous state of the factories and rescue them from their urgent plight. Workers should realize the difficulties of the factories and work together to support their progress, so that everyone can survive. All Chinese citizens should use their conscience to buy national products to save themselves and save the country.</p>
<h3 id="e233">National Products Year and Trade Deficit By Bao Cunming <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>All animals with blood have a strong resistance to external oppression. Even if they cannot use active methods to launch a head-on attack, at least——especially humans, I think——because they are all spiritual and understanding——they will also use a passive method, swearing to boycott to show that their spirit has not been subjected to any surrender.</p>
<p>In the current situation in China, with material construction being so immature and military defense being so lax, the only way to resist stubborn enemies is of course passive. The fact is so, and I do not find it hateful that the government is unwilling to send troops on a large scale, but I cannot help but have some doubts about the responsibilities within the reach of every citizen's power.</p>
<p>According to the most reliable survey, China's trade situation last year was:</p>
<p>Total Imports   728,333,916 yuan</p>
<p>Total Exports   315,485,016 yuan</p>
<p>Trade Deficit  412,848,900 yuan</p>
<p>This is truly a very strange phenomenon. In the past, when we did not advocate national products, mark a National Products Year, and resist foreign economic aggression——although there were several partial promotions of national products and eight or nine boycotts of Japanese and foreign goods, but none were as serious as this time——although there were also trade deficits, the amount was not so large. Moreover, this time it is still the "National Products Year" after everyone suffered great humiliation and shouted themselves hoarse!</p>
<p>Compatriots! The existence or demise of a country depends on the spirit of its people. War is secondary. Advocating national products and resisting foreign economic oppression is the expression of national spirit. If the trade deficit continues to increase annually as it is now, then the Chinese national spirit is dead. In other words, China has the possibility of immediate demise.</p>
<p>This is not intentionally saying unlucky things. The fact is indeed so. The reason why the amount of the trade deficit is so huge is all created by every citizen. According to the total imports last year, on average, everyone bought two yuan of foreign goods in the National Products Year. Do you think it is strange or not? In short, everything must start from reality. Merely shouting "National Products Year," "Women's National Products Year," "×× National Products Year" is not effective.</p>
<h3 id="e234">What I Should Do for Women's National Products Year <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>Using national products is everyone's inherent duty; it cannot be accomplished solely by a portion of young people or women. It requires the joint promotion of all our beloved compatriots. If we can use them with one heart and one mind, I think we will definitely be able to completely eliminate imported goods.</p>
<p>Women also bear a great responsibility for promoting national products; however, this year is Women's National Products Year, so the responsibility they bear is even more significant. I will now put aside all empty talk and only talk about the work I should do for this year's Women's National Products Year, as briefly described below!</p>
<p>(1) In terms of clothing, food, and housing——I am determined not to use foreign goods for my needs in clothing, food, and housing, but only use national products; if any of the three items are unavailable in national products, I will resolutely replace them with other items. If my compatriots use one less cent of foreign goods, they will recover one cent of rights for the country. I hope the sisters in my circle will work hard to do this.</p>
<p>(2) Persuade my husband——If my husband likes to use foreign goods, I should earnestly persuade him to stop using them. If he repeatedly refuses to listen to my persuasion, I will resolutely use the words "divorce" to prompt him to realize his mistake.</p>
<p>(3) Things used by children——If I already have children, then I will never buy foreign toys or other items for my children, but will buy national products across the board.</p>
<p>(4) Persuade relatives and friends to use national products——For relatives and friends who like to use foreign goods, I should persuade them with very sincere words, so that they understand that the reason why our country's national products cannot be promoted is because all compatriots are unwilling to use national products, so all the merchants have no choice but to smuggle foreign goods. Dear relatives and friends! You must understand that the more money we give them, the more bullets they will make. Looking at it this way, isn't it dangerous? Relatives and friends! Can you really not use national products?</p>
<p>The four points mentioned above are all clichés. I am afraid that you are unwilling to read them again, right? However, I always hope that all the young people and sisters can implement them in this way. I think this year's Women's National Products Year will definitely achieve great results.</p>
<h3 id="e235">The Position of Women in the National Products World By Zhang Mengzhao <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>There is an old saying: "Those who respect others are always respected by others, and those who love others are always loved by others." That is to say: If you respect and love others, others will also respect and love you. I want to put it another way: If you respect and love the country and love national products, others will also respect your personality! Women—under the feudal legacy, have always been looked down upon in society! Now everyone is raising the status of women, and the situation is different. This year is designated as "Women's National Products Year" because if the women's world can love and use national products, then women have the ability to turn things around! In the text "Feminine Views of Ancient and Modern Philosophers" translated by Mr. Lang Lixun: His prelude is "In the past, although women's position in society was dominated by male power, all social activities were actually centered on women. Husbands in the family all obeyed their wives. The family is a cell of the social organization, so all social activities, although attributed to men, they are puppets, and those who pull the strings behind the scenes are actually women. Men's activities are just gestures." I am very confident that Mr. Lang's words are absolutely right!</p>
<p>(1) Mrs. Karan Mirquet Alice said: A woman's smile! Is a universal language.</p>
<p>(2) Filon said: Men will not achieve anything without the help of women in action!</p>
<p>(3) Triller said: The expansion of women's rights is the highest principle of all social evolution. A woman's heart is the source of her soul and wisdom!</p>
<p>(4) Napoleon, the first Emperor of France, said: Without women in the palace, it is like a year without spring, and even more like spring without beautiful roses!</p>
<p>(5) Bocknick, a senior official of the German drinking group, said: Our women maintain the highest value and the most important power in their bodies!</p>
<p>After reading it, I feel that the position of women in the national products world is also so important! Without women promoting, wholeheartedly loving the country and purchasing national products, the national products world is really terrible! Women can be said to be the hub of the rise and fall of national products! The authority in the national products world! Don't just exist in form but be dead in heart! I hope you will bring out the power of your mothers and daughters to do something earnestly, to achieve some results, and to show some color to everyone. Don't live in contradictions every day and lose the position of women! Tian Renzheng, who "sells national products well," is seeking your help to achieve success!</p>

<p>— Zhang Mengfei</p>
<p>Now society loves being modern, extremely desirous of extravagance beyond description. The prosperity of Shanghai is called sleepless, and modern women are up-to-date. Snow flower powder and perfume essence come from Paris, the capital of France. White-bearded watches show the time, transported from Switzerland with a famous reputation. The clothes on the body are imported goods, and the leather shoes make a rustling sound with high heels. Diamonds turn their heads and shine their eyes. Calculated, a whole body is worth thousands of gold. The furniture at home is from Western Europe and North America, and all kinds of utensils are from foreign countries. This causes domestic money to flow outward. It is difficult to calculate the leaking cup, and it is really heartbreaking. She also says that imported goods are the most modern, but she knows that they have misunderstood the meaning of modern. Why must modern be foreign people? Chinese national products are also modern. Look at the gorgeous silk and satin, and the gauze and cotton cloth are rarely compared, far better than wool by thousands of points. Other goods are not much worse. Why send money to foreigners? Chinese goods are of good quality and low price, and can be said to be satisfactory everywhere. Since national products have been promoted, it is both patriotic and modern. It is known that modern was originally interpreted as contradictory. Sure enough, contradictions are not clear. This year's National Products Year is about to pass, but national products must still be kept in mind. Everyone promotes Chinese goods, and I advise the female compatriots, as the ancients said, that united will is an impregnable stronghold.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Madam Pan Gongzhan By Yu Qiacheng <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>"The market for foreign goods is almost entirely dominated by urban women, especially those urban women who are knowledgeable or</p>
<p>modernized. Therefore, the people who should be advocated in the Women's National Products Year, rather than rural women or uneducated women, are more accurately those urban women who are knowledgeable." Madam Tang Guanyu, the wife of Pan Gongzhan, spoke very sadly and practically at the opening ceremony of the Women's National Products Year.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the cold winter, sparse snowflakes fluttered around the house, and I went to visit Madam Pan.</p>
<p>The guest room was quiet, without any extraneous sounds. The arrangement was not very luxurious, and the tables and chairs were distributed in an orderly manner; especially the chimes coming from the adjacent study contained poetic meaning. Although this place is in the city, there is no urban noise.</p>
<p>Madam Pan, who is about thirty years old, wearing a national product silk dress, walked down from the upstairs.</p>
<p>I came specifically to solicit opinions on the work of the Women's National Products Year. After I raised this question, she pondered for a while and replied:</p>
<p>"This year, various groups have designated it as the Women's National Products Year, which means that women should promote national products and revitalize industries. Originally, last year was National Products Year, and adding the word 'women' this year is nothing more than wanting women to do more. However, I think that the work of this year's Women's National Products movement requires everyone to unite, and everyone to jointly take responsibility, to recover rights and interests for the country and nation in this period of national crisis filled with wind and rain"!</p>
<p>Then, Madam Pan also put forward her own opinions, hoping that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other industrial and commercial groups would carefully conduct an investigation, not only for inferior goods and hateful goods, but also for general imported goods, so that they are separated from our national products; because the responsibility of the women's world is to promote, and establishing a standard is the help that industrial groups should provide.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people do not understand why women should specifically be responsible for promoting national products? Madam Pan has a strong reason here:</p>
<p>"We women promote national products, and we must have this view, that is, not to let our precious children become slaves to a perished country in the future!"</p>
<p>There is no mother in the world who does not love her children. If we extend our maternal love to protect national products, for the sake of our children, it is always worthwhile for our women to work hard to promote national products. Does that mean that men have no responsibility in Women's National Products Year? On the passive side, they should also provide some help.</p>
<p>"At the same time, I hope that men will not envy the need for modernity, so that their wives can go from frugality to promoting national products!" When Madam Pan's conversation turned to this point, she expressed the hopes of the general women on their behalf.</p>
<p>After that, we also talked about family affairs and children's issues. From Madam Pan's opinions, I recognized that she was always thinking about the future of the young children, so all the methods can be generally said to be child-centered. Originally, in this era, so-called modern ladies have no reason to abandon the normal life of the family (neither participating in labor for economic reasons, nor participating in social undertakings for political reasons). If we return to the child-centered view, not only can we reduce some of the current bad consumption, but also contribute to the future of our nation, which is so great!</p>
<p>In order to study the methods of raising children, we also talked about the social status of Chinese women. She felt that the usual unnecessary caution of general mothers was the result of society's restraint on women. However, she is still very optimistic, believing that in the past, Chinese women have had famous female writers, as well as female heroes who joined the army and fought, and also women who obtained political power, so her conclusion is:</p>
<p>"What history tells us shows that women are not weak!"</p>
<p>After the conversation, I said goodbye and went out. Before parting, Madam Pan repeatedly urged me about the work of this year's Women's National Products Year:</p>
<p>"The most important thing is the investigation work."</p>

<p>— Yu</p>
<p>In ancient times, people conquered animals, reducing jackals to house dogs, and domesticating wild cattle and sheep into tame cattle and sheep. Later generations used the same method to conquer mankind, tightly wrapping the feet of women, and piercing their ears with needles, and binding their chests with belts. For men, there were many decorations and restraints——anciently called etiquette——bowing and making obeisance, and the clanging of jade pendants, to make people unable to jump, unable to run, and even more unable to somersault.</p>
<p>What is not the same in literature! Seven-character quatrains and five-character ancient poems, level and oblique tones, are nothing more than to obliterate poetic sentiment and completely restrain nature, and then twist and pinch in dozens of words, claiming to have skill. In writing, I learn Yan, and you learn Liu. For example, after the Jiaqing Emperor changed a few words in the memorials, he made the writing of an era tend to be vulgar, and no one dared to write an ancient word or use a rare word. Later, even someone as enlightened as Zhang Wenxiang still babbled a lot when testing scholars in Sichuan, telling the scholars how to write the words and how to omit strokes. However, almost everyone who writes or composes boasts: At least mine is better than yours!</p>
<p>However, the modern era is the twentieth century! People all say that. But although the West is a century after the nineteenth century and before the twenty-first century, it does not seem appropriate to call it that in China. We should call ourselves the two thousand four hundred and something years after the birth of Confucius. We simply cannot get rid of the old bondage, let alone a new enlightenment. As soon as we reform, we immediately return to the old ways. It is always the desolation of autumn, without the development of spring. We abandon regulated verse to write sonnets, discard the Four Books and taste root records to pick up literary guides, abandon turbans and add square doctoral hats, and pick up fountain pens to write "Kneeling report Fu An." Why is that?</p>
<p>The masses are now striving to drill into the old nets, binding themselves, thinking that they are blessed and very civilized! On the contrary, they ridicule and persecute free souls, wanting to drag them down to destruction. But as the old saying goes, "Stones pressing grass never kills," free life cannot be suppressed!</p>
<h3 id="e239">Talking about the Japanese By Mu Mutian <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Anyone who has not been to Japan proper, I am afraid that no one will believe that there are good people in Japan. Seeing the Japanese ronin who create bandits in "Manchuria", seeing the Japanese ronin who sell opium and traffic in handguns in "Manchuria", seeing the Japanese prostitutes who run brothels, we may arbitrarily say that they represent the entirety of the Japanese people, that they represent the "Yamato race."</p>
<p>Indeed, the Japanese residents in "Manchuria" have never given me a good impression. I always thought they were the embodiment of "evil." When I was young, I always thought that the Japanese were all like that. My concept of the Japanese, I am afraid, would never have changed if I had not lived in Japan proper.</p>
<p>However, things cannot be generalized from one aspect. No matter which country it is, there are good people and bad people. When I went to Japan to study, my concept of the Japanese changed. When I first arrived in Japan, I directly felt that the Japanese in their own country treated the Chinese much better than those "residents" in "Manchuria." At least, there was no such fierce look as in "Manchuria." Later, after entering school and the language became fluent, I met some Japanese friends who I could talk to. At that time, I felt that there were also good people among the Japanese.</p>
<p>The few years of living in the outer prefectures made me feel even more amiable towards the Japanese. I found the Japanese to be simple and naive. Although I was a foreigner, a "Chinese" who they despised, some Japanese people seemed not to discriminate against me. Naturally, the Japanese people I met were neither warlords, nor chaebols, nor policemen, but simple people who ran small shops, farmed the land, sold flowers, and so on. I felt that I was living comfortably and leisurely, and I was not placed in an atmosphere of oppression.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1924, Mr. □ and I went to the Ito coast and lived in a farmer's home. There, I really felt incredible. In that farmer's home, there was an old woman in her fifties who still went to work in the fields on the mountains in the hot weather of August. She did not know the world situation, let alone the Sino-Japanese relationship. She talked to us about everything, when the sea breeze blew at night, and we sat on the stones by the roadside and talked. The naive and kind appearance was something I had never seen before. It is said that there are many such simple-minded people in Japanese rural areas.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that there are no bad people in Japan proper. Bad people naturally exist everywhere. In Ito Temple, I met a monk who owned huge temple property, and every year, he still "transformed" a lot of alms money. He ate very well, and had a wife and three sons. (It is common for monks to marry wives in Japan.) However, from his words, we discovered that he had a lot of conspiracies. And some of the teachers in the school also looked down on us.</p>
<p>Another time, coming back from Tokyo, I met a Japanese man on the train who said that he had come to "Manchuria" to make a living, and very politely asked us to take care of him along the way. Although not a simple person, he was not like a ronin. He behaved well all the way. However, on the Korean railway, after contacting several other Japanese people on the same train, he changed a little. After arriving in Andong, perhaps because he heard the conversations of other "residents" and understood his own position, he solemnly put on the air of a citizen of the first-class country. He did not even speak to us.</p>
<p>In short, if we have the opportunity to have further contact with the Japanese, we can know that among them, there are bad and good.</p>

<p>The room was crowded with people——father, mother, uncle, aunt, several children——everyone was silent.</p>
<p>The aunt lightly walked in and out, bringing tea and water…</p>
<p>Standing opposite the father was a doctor, wiping the gauze with a medicinal needle, slightly shaking his head, and forcefully blowing out the kerosene lamp.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Death <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>

<p>"Give her a shot of a heart stimulant, see if that helps," the doctor said softly, drawing some liquid from a vial.</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Grandmother lay on the bed, her face changing from pale to ashen. Her eyes were slightly open, as if covered by a white film, with no light in them. Her mouth was also open, and she was breathing with difficulty, her chest rising and falling violently.</p>
<p>The doctor took the needle and approached the bed:</p>
<p>"Lift her up a bit, so I can give her the shot."</p>
<p>Aunt put her hand behind Grandmother's back, preparing to lift her up, but immediately withdrew her hand.</p>
<p>"Doctor, just give it like that! I can't lift her, her back is stiff..." Aunt's eyes were filled with tears.</p>
<p>"Don't give the shot, I..."</p>
<p>The slurred voice broke off, the trembling mouth seemed to still be speaking, finally nodding, as if saying "Goodbye," and her eyes gradually closed.</p>
<p>"Give her the shot!" Aunt shouted, "Give her a heart stimulant!" Tears welled up in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Can't give it anymore."</p>
<p>"Give it! I want to see my mother for a little longer!"</p>
<p>Grandmother seemed about to cough up phlegm, but the phlegm got stuck in her throat, blocking her breathing, and the movement in her chest ceased.</p>
<p>Aunt jumped to the bedside, threw herself on Grandmother, crying and shouting like mad, touching Grandmother's face:</p>
<p>"She's not dead yet! She's not dead yet! Her nose is still warm! Give her the shot..."</p>
<p>But soon, the room was filled with weeping.</p>

<p>— Wei Jinzhi</p>
<p>"What are you saying?" She was almost angry, her face flushed red, her strong personality revealed without concealment. "I'm telling you!" She said seriously, "I came out to work outside to make a living, to live independently. Last year, I earned some money, but not much, and I didn't want to go back like that, so I didn't. But this year, someone came to tell me: Last Chinese New Year, there were only my parents, my second brother, and my little niece at home. As soon as New Year's came, my second brother went to gamble in the village; my mother went to the temple to chant New Year's prayers; and a niece, wouldn't she go play with the other children during the New Year? So, the house was empty, with only my father. It was New Year's, and even the first day of the New Year! A family can't just close their doors, or would it still be a family? But our house has two doors, a front door and a back door, and there was only my father. So he walked from the front door to the back door, and from the back door to the front door, and there were so many people coming and going for the New Year. So he had no choice, even though it was the New Year, but to sit on the bed and cry!"</p>
<p>As she spoke, her eyes reddened, and mine warmed up as well.</p>
<p>Usually, I naturally thought about the state of rural economic bankruptcy, but because it was my own family's business, I had never seemed to think about it that way. Thinking about it, yes, my family was a complete example. As for me, it was because I had read a few books that I had been away for many years, and my younger sister and sister-in-law had also gone their separate ways for the sake of their future lives. Of a family of seven, half were drifting outside. A home that was usually quite lively had become deserted, scattered, and without any semblance of a family. Immediately, a picture floated in my sorrowful mind:</p>
<p>"The women are in the main room, eating peanuts and melon seeds, the children are rolling copper coins, all wearing new clothes, not working, gathered together, saying some unimportant things. And my father, he is sitting in a passageway connecting the main room to the side room. That place is usually his room, as if he were a spider occupying the center of my family. Now, he is also wearing the cotton robe he wore when he got married, a pair of cloth socks, a pair of shoes, sitting on the dim bed where he usually stays, not using a handkerchief or his sleeves, but wiping away tears with his own stiff and trembling hands. Those hands, they are the hands that worked hard, labored, and raised us, they should have been idle long ago, and now they are wiping away tears."</p>
<p>So for the second time, my eyes became hot again, I wiped away the tears, but forced a smile and said to my sister, "I'm going back, I was just teasing you, I want to go back with you."</p>
<p>The next day, we braved the snow and wind and returned home together!</p>

<p>— Wen Juan</p>
<p>The boundless blue sea, I don't know when, had one corner painted with a gray-yellow color, so these two absolutely irreconcilable colors of seawater were eternally arguing beside an isolated island, as if seeking a judgment. But this small island itself seemed to have hidden worries, just silently watching these seas and never being able to give them an answer. This small island is the famous Hong Kong, and it is also the destination of my trip this time.</p>
<p>When I first landed, I saw that the stores were not very grand or luxurious, and the market was very desolate. I thought to myself: Everyone says Hong Kong is good, but where exactly is Hong Kong's goodness?</p>
<p>I rushed to ×× Street and found □□ Jun. He has lived here for a long time and is very familiar with everything here. I told him my questions, and he just smiled without answering. After eating, he took me out for a walk. The flat, smooth roads, shaded by trees, were similar to Shanghai. But as we walked, the road under our feet gradually rose, winding around several turns, and when I looked back, I was already halfway up the mountain. Before me were crisscrossing asphalt roads, matched with the lush green hills, like countless silver-gray ribbons, tightly tied around a pile of emerald jade. The cut faces of the hills were decorated with patterns of deep yellow or brown gravel, and the crevices in the stones were filled with many unknown wildflowers. The petals were huge, and the colors were bright, probably all subtropical plants. A stream flowed below the mountain path, though artificially constructed, the sound of its murmuring was very pleasant. Black iron railings wound around all the mountain roads and both sides of the ditches, looking like a spider web from a distance. A car suddenly emerged from the flower and tree woven screen and disappeared into the depths of the jungle. Countless buildings of different colors hid under the green shade, quietly dreaming their beautiful dreams. There was no sound around, only the barking of mountain dogs broke the silence of the space.</p>
<p>"It's an absolutely beautiful big garden!" I exclaimed at the panorama of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>"A desolate island in the hands of the Chinese, once it falls into the hands of the British, becomes a scenic spot. From the national point of view, ceding land is certainly an unfortunate thing, but for the Chinese living here, especially the Chinese who love order and are rich in aesthetic appreciation, perhaps there is the opposite view!" As we spoke, we suddenly heard a commotion on the mountain, followed by many people running down the mountain, running and bumping into each other, shouting and laughing. The kind of disorder and disorganization, compared with the neat buildings around them, gave people an indescribable feeling. They were probably all natives of Hong Kong. The young women wore big pants (no skirts), with a large braid hanging behind their heads. Some wore silver bracelets on their hands, while others did not wear bracelets but wore anklets. The older ones mostly wore buns, with hairpins and earrings, similar to the dress of the Yangtze River area twenty years ago. The men who accompanied them had no braids and held birdcages and pipes in their hands. Judging from the appearance of their skin, nutrition, and gorgeous clothing, they had a good material life, but in their expressions and words, it was impossible to find a trace of education. These are probably the typical good people in the colony.</p>
<p>When going down the mountain, the fragrance of flowers, the gentleness and breath of the sea, and the strong smell of opium smoke mixed together. Their eternally irreconcilable breath may be the characteristic of Hong Kong.</p>

<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>"Then, when are you going to tell them? How about I go with you now?"</p>
<p>"Go? I have some other things to do. I have to go to the office later. I'll give you an answer within a day or two."</p>
<p>A day passed, no answer; two days passed, no answer. It was Saturday, the 27th; by that afternoon, Yina couldn't bear it anymore, she could only go find Xi Zhuoyun again.</p>
<p>"You're here, I was just about to write you a letter," Zhuoyun said, while inviting Yina to sit down.</p>
<p>She sat down in the guest seat she was used to, but didn't say anything.</p>
<p>"Things might be a bit bad. Listen to me. Originally, the staff here could get an advance on their salary for this month, but this month is the end of the year, when everyone needs money, but the manager has issued a notice saying that no one can get an advance on their salary. We pushed two representatives to ask, but they were rejected. Think about it, they treat the staff here so harshly, let alone outsiders like you? Not to mention that your novel hasn't been signed yet, so you can't get paid, even the published ones, and even the royalties for January, have been decided not to be paid. Several people have already come to ask for royalties, but there's no way."</p>
<p>Yina didn't say anything, just stared at him.</p>
<p>He was casually flipping through the books, letters, and so on on the table. Finally, he pulled out a letter and gave it to Yina.</p>
<p>She thought it was about her business, but after reading it, she knew it was a proofreader there writing to Xi Zhuoyun. Because the proofreader heard that his position was in danger, he was begging Xi Zhuoyun for help. After she finished reading it, she handed the letter back to him, wondering why he wanted her to read that letter? Was he implying to her that the letter she wrote to him was not humble enough, compared to the proofreader's letter? Or was he boasting that someone was begging him? Would he see her as one of the people begging him? Would he show the letter she gave him to others, just like he just showed her the proofreader's letter? Why did he want her to read that letter?</p>
<p>"You see, there's no way," he said with a sigh, seeing that she didn't say anything.</p>
<p>Yina felt that her eyes were a little dry, and forced herself to hold back.</p>
<p>Zhuoyun was silent for a while, and silence tightly enveloped them.</p>

<p>The Strength of Pulling Up Gradually Dissipates</p>
<p>Today is Settlement Day, Market Closed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange only traded April futures for one month. May futures must be listed on the 30th. Large investors entering and exiting the market were still very active. The trend gradually shows a state where prices cannot be pulled up, and may spiral downwards. Sellers such as No. 38 still sold large quantities. Numbers 43, 54, and 79 were also actively selling. These numbers mostly possess real strength, with a few being bulls exiting the market. The false air of "96" is gradually disappearing, which can be said to be much ado about nothing. Yesterday morning, when the market opened, numbers 27, 31, 35, and 53 were actively buying and covering short positions. "Troop Reduction" continued to rise by 40 cents, and the rest also rose by 20 to 30 cents. The Salt Tax reached a high of 55 yuan and 5 cents, 5 cents lower than the highest price on the 24th, but it failed to break through. "96" initially still showed signs of struggling, but ultimately, the market makers had already profited and exited, and the strength to pull up prices was weak, so it still turned down slightly by 20 to 30 cents. In the second session, large investors sold across the board, and the market gradually loosened, resulting in a unanimous decline of about 20 to 50 cents. In the afternoon, the situation showed no signs of improvement, and sellers did not stop, continuing to decline slightly by 20 to 30 cents. Only the 20 series saw a slight increase of 20 cents due to greater demand from No. 31, but it ultimately failed to restore confidence. Trading at the close was relatively quiet, the trend was chaotic, and highs and lows were seen alternately, only about 10 cents apart. As a result of the market price, except for the 18 series, which was slightly better by 20 cents, the rest mostly fell by 20 to 30 cents. However, "96" continued to decline slightly by 70 cents, and the difference from the highest price on the 26th was already 2 yuan and 60 cents. Today is the settlement day for March futures, and the market is closed for one day. Also, the total transaction volume yesterday was 12,220,700 yuan. The high, low, rise, and fall are compared and listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>According to a report by Sinh Feng &amp; Co. from the Chinese Merchants Daily News, the New York stock market yesterday stated that President Roosevelt requested this Congress to enact a law governing securities and commodity exchanges, while New York Governor Lehman used radio broadcasts to urge the public to maintain policies for the management of public utilities. The initial plunge was the most severe seen this year. The small exchange market also fell. Speculative bonds initially fell and then recovered, but the results were still lower than before. High-grade bonds and U.S. government bonds remained firm because they were irrelevant to the management of the exchange. According to the company's agent's report, (securities) fell due to Roosevelt's insistence on managing the exchange, and the bottom gradually improved later. (Wheat) was threatened by the legislation managing the exchange, and bulls sold off. When it falls again, it can be bought. (Cotton) opened low because Roosevelt's attitude towards managing the exchange was firm, and when the amount of ginning exceeded the limit, a tax of at least 8 cents per pound would be levied. It is predicted that the case can be voted on and passed early. The market fluctuated narrowly, and the May contract was settled. Gauze was slightly better, and the spot market was quiet. The total trading volume for the day was 1.59 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>[Two Days Off for Qingming, April 4th and 5th]</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to decline, and the situation is quite weak. Prices for previous months were sluggish, and the market closed at its lowest point. Sellers' intentions are becoming stronger, and more new sellers are emerging. The market is becoming increasingly volatile, while actual demand is becoming quieter. However, according to some sources, shareholders' groups are buying in to maintain the price of newly marked yarn, so the market price has risen slightly. In short, the sales of spot yarn are too sluggish, and factories cannot unite, so it is difficult to recover market prices.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Marked Yarn Continues to Decline <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>

<p>The cotton market is falling sharply. As American cotton is declining, buyers are fearful and are settling their long positions. The market has loosened and the downward trend is strong. Suyuan Trading Co. took advantage of the decline to make substantial offsetting purchases, suppressing the speculative atmosphere. However, the yarn market is in decline, factory demand has stalled, and some Japanese factories have proposed reducing work hours, so cotton consumption is becoming increasingly sluggish.</p>

<h3 id="e258">A Depressing Situation for Factory Demand <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>The spot cotton business is increasingly depressed. As the yarn market is declining, factories have no intention of purchasing. Transactions are quite quiet. The sources include 290 bales of Tonghua cotton and 223 bales of Yaohua cotton. Spot cotton prices are as follows: Tianjin American cotton, purchase price 7.50; Gongda Factory purchase 238 pieces; spot delivery to factory. Local cotton 37.75; Yukang Factory purchase 300 bales; spot delivery to Wuxi. Fire Machine cotton 37.75; Dongmian Bank purchase 400 bales; price offset in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Donghua Factory First to Implement a 20% Reduction in Work Hours</p>
<p>The sales of cotton yarn from Japanese yarn factories have recently seen purchases of 25,000 bales by the Tianjin group, but have since turned quiet again. In addition, raw cotton prices are high, and a spring sales boom is difficult to see. Overseas markets have not increased sales due to exchange rate depreciation, causing great disappointment to the factories. To prevent the heavy pressure of unsold yarn, the move to reduce work hours has been raised again. Various factories are secretly negotiating. Donghua Yarn Factory has reportedly already implemented a 20% reduction in work hours.</p>
<h3 id="e260">American Cotton Falls Again by More Than Ten Pounds <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market fluctuated and was uncertain. Initially, it fell due to long positions being settled, but later, it recovered due to some short positions being covered. As a result, spot prices fell by 15 pounds, and futures fell by 8 to 13 pounds. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 4 points, and futures fell by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to futures traders selling, but later rose due to a small number of European exporters buying. As a result, Pingar fell by 2.5 jiao, Aumra rose by 7.5 jiao, and Bairoxi remained unchanged. The original telegram is recorded on the left (27th telegram):</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month was generally flat and weak. As quotations for foreign wheat in Chicago continued to decline by about 3-4 jiao, and those in Canada declined by 1 jiao, market sentiment remained flat and weak after opening. Transactions were not numerous. All groups of actual sales customers felt that purchases were light and unanimously waited and watched. Therefore, although most manufacturers still agreed not to sell, they ultimately could not reverse the actual trend. When the market opened in the afternoon, each month generally hovered, and transactions were also exceptionally quiet. It was only heard that small factories had slightly hedged sales, so the market sentiment was slightly weak. Looking at the future situation, there is little opportunity for recovery. As a result, the current month was unchanged, April and May were down by 7.5 li, June and July were unchanged, and August was down by 2.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Wheat Futures Benefit from Rainy Weather <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning, each month was unusually quiet. Only a few cars were opened for August, and the rest were empty. When the market opened in the afternoon, transactions were relatively active. Market sentiment was slightly higher due to the rainy weather. Whether considering the facts or comparing various grain prices, it is feared that there may be changes in the market value of new wheat this year. As a result, April and July were better by 1 fen, and August was better by 3 fen. Spot wheat also showed weak signs, with prices down by 3-5 fen compared to the peak price. Bengbu wheat opened at 3 yuan 4 jiao 7 fen, Yaowan wheat at 3 yuan 5 jiao 7 fen, Yingzhou wheat at 3 yuan 4 jiao 8 fen, and Nansuzhou wheat at 3 yuan 3 jiao 6 fen, totaling 3,200 bags, reportedly purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Rice Market, Ship's Foot Stalled by Rain <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources in South Shanghai were 40-50 boats (over 6,000 shih), but due to continuous rainy weather, very few customers came to the market, and transactions were scarce. The situation was even quieter. The ship's foot was stalled by the rain, and the situation was virtually stagnant. As sources were plentiful, the market inevitably slumped. For example, the prices of regular bang su, tong, nan, gang, etc. purchased by this street were all reduced by 5 fen, and although the appetite of customer bang was somewhat active, the number was limited. The northern bang purchased a total of over 1,000 bags, and the southern bang did not take any. Although sellers repeatedly tried to tighten the market for late rice, the soft prices of Qingjiao, Sijing, and Xilian, etc. were down by 3-4 fen due to flat customer intentions. Duyangjian's sales were better and could still stand firm. The color of the Metamorphosis Yin Yuan was slightly softer, and the price remained largely unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Ningbo and Oujiang Actively Purchase Customer Rice <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for customer rice continued to arrive, but sales were very active. This street and the Fujian bang are still watching, but the Wenzhou bang from Zhejiang Province continues to purchase smoothly, with a strong appetite. The Ningdu bang is also making inquiries. Market sentiment and the market have gradually become firmer. The prices of high-grade goods in each stall have uniformly increased by 3-5 fen, while medium and low-grade goods remain flat. The entire city purchased 405 bags of coarse rice from Shashi, 1,230 bags of sen rice from Nanjing and Wuhu, and 180 bags of Jingliu coarse rice from Ningbo, with no other transactions. The market shape remains firm.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Soybean Factories Purchase Well <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market temporarily stabilized. Factories had a good appetite for purchases. Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo, this street, and inland areas all actively purchased, so the market sentiment was slightly flat. Yesterday, factories reportedly purchased 11-12 cars of Yingzhou beans, priced from 2 yuan 4 jiao 8 fen to 4 jiao 5 fen, and 4 cars of Nanhe beans, priced at 2 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen. Two cars of Bozhou beans were also transacted, priced at 2 yuan 4 jiao 2 fen. There were also 4-5 cars of Guide beans, and although they were not transacted, the difference between the buying and selling price was only 1-2 fen, so a transaction may be possible. Other gangs also transacted 6-7 cars of various beans.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Sugar Market, Chaozhou Raw Sugar Continues to Open <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw little trading because the customs was closing today. The association's pricing for No. 24 coarse granulated white was 19 yuan 9 jiao, but no transactions were made. Over a hundred bags of domestic Chaozhou raw sugar were opened, priced from 11 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen, 7 jiao 5 fen, to 5 jiao. No. 1 Mianbai from this factory was priced at 18 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen and 18 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen, with some sporadic transactions. Hainan red sugar continues to arrive, priced at 13 yuan 4-5 jiao for the upper grades and around 13 yuan for the lower grades. Yesterday, the Qingyuan ship transported 357 bags of green sugar and 21 bags of Zhiyang. The Yisheng ship transported 173 bags of Zhiyang, 69 bags of green sugar, and 31 bags of red sand. In addition, there were a total of 269 bags of transit goods.</p>

<p>Since the red rice from Shantou opened at a red price, the market has been stagnant for a long time due to sluggish customer sales. Recently, the northern gang has started to purchase, and the Tianjin gang is also actively inquiring, so the market has turned bullish. High-grade Zhuang needs 35 yuan, and secondary goods range from 30 yuan to 28 yuan. Ordinary goods are 20 yuan. It is heard that there is not much inventory left, and arrivals are not strong, so the market is expected to tighten.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Orchid Seeds, High-Grade Goods Extremely Scarce <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Medium-grade products from Zhangzhou orchid are extremely scarce. For example, goods that are completely yellow have opened at 48 yuan. However, the 20 pieces that arrived earlier did not open due to their poor color. Yesterday, it was heard that the Taiyuan ship loaded 21 pieces, and samples are expected to be seen today. If the color is bright yellow, clean, and free of sand, the previous price can still be maintained.</p>

<p>[Guangdong Factory Silk Shipped to Shanghai for Sale] Due to the rampant decline and encroachment on sales by Japanese silk in overseas markets, the market price of white factory silk in Guangdong has plummeted, and there are still few inquiries. The spring cocoons in Guangdong province will soon be on the market, and the silk is still thick. They are shipped to Shanghai for sale. Recently, domestic silk weavers, seeing that the opening price of Guangdong silk is less than 400 yuan per package (80 catties) and the quality is excellent, are rushing to buy it. As a result, the sales of Jiangzhe white factories through the silk door are increasingly deteriorating.</p>
<p>[Dou Gong Silk Supply Cannot Meet Demand] The only Dou Gong silk factory in this port is Fulunheng, which is working as usual. Silk production is limited, and demand in India is still strong, so supply cannot meet demand. This ten-day period only saw 34 packages of Dou Gong silk shipped to India and Switzerland.</p>
<p>[White Factory Jing Has Price but No Market] Silk prices in European and American markets are still falling, and no one is inquiring about Chinese silk. There is still a lot of silk in Shanghai. In the blink of an eye, new cocoons will be on the market. Although Chinese silk merchants are eager to sell, the losses are huge. Each package of Shanghai white factory Jing needs to lose more than 200 yuan, but there is still a price but no market. There is no way to dump it, and the market is in a slump. Yesterday, only Indian Zhuang entered 7 packages of yellow coarse silk and 10 packages of white tu silk, and prices were all trending downwards.</p>

<p>There are two types of raincoat cloth, thick and thin, with many patterns and names. Recently, thin goods like elephant skin lining cloth have been selling poorly. The only type that is active and selling well in the market is single-sided rubber-coated cloth. 70-80% of the wool and clothing stores on this street are selling it. Although thin goods are cheap, there is no demand. This spring, single-sided rubber-coated raincoat cloth sold for a high of 5 yuan 5 jiao and a low of 5 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen. Currently, the standard market price is a good 5 yuan 3 jiao, because sales have been smooth due to the continuous rainy weather.</p>

<h3 id="e291">Not Optimistic <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>– Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Tang Youren, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, who returned from inspecting diplomacy in North China, gave a speech on the 24th regarding his observations over the past year. He stated: "Wherever I went, I was filled with many emotions that cannot be fully expressed in a single sentence." However, in short, the situation in North China is "not optimistic. How it will evolve depends on how we make continuous efforts in internal affairs and diplomacy."</p>
<p>After carefully listening to this restrained yet meaningful speech, we sigh and lament at its implications, and also feel a sense of warning and encouragement. Since the "September 18th Incident," when the cannons roared, the northeastern provinces were lost in an instant. Our already weakened China has contracted a serious illness due to an acute cold. Just as a dying person prays for God's forgiveness, many people are celebrating that the League of Nations, the "God of Peace," adopted the Lytton Report and passed a resolution not recognizing the puppet organization, believing that "justice has been served" and that diplomacy has triumphed. However, our clog-wearing friends, who are determined to implement their continental policy, will not be deterred by a unanimous League of Nations resolution except for the removal of dissenting votes. Moreover, understanding the principle that strength can overcome softness, they will certainly not be satisfied with merely three provinces. Therefore, once Shanhaiguan was lost, Rehe immediately changed color, and the situation in eastern Luan became urgent. We had no choice but to embrace the principle of "peace," to understand each other, and to seek tranquility by appeasement.</p>
<p>However, the ceasefire agreement demarcated by a demilitarized zone is as ridiculous as demarcating a border with a Hong ditch. Not only can our clog-wearing friends use pretexts to invade at any time, but just as Emperor Gaozu of Han deployed troops at Guangwu to closely monitor Pengcheng, the war zone has become a means of political and economic control over North China. Therefore, although the evil specter of war has vanished with the gentle breeze of peace, another rising political and economic force has suppressed North China. Remotely, recovering Shanhaiguan and the passes of the Great Wall is more difficult than conquering Jingzhou. Not only has it not been completed in a year, but it is no longer in its original state. More recently, the military exercises in Peiping and Tianjin are nothing less than a strong military presence threatening the border.</p>
<p>These are the obvious things. As for other trivial matters, how can we not find a trace of them? When the puppet officials took the stage, the Japanese concession in Tianjin widely publicized and celebrated; Yoshiko Kawashima, a well-known and typical devil who had performed extraordinary feats in the Northeast and Shanghai, toured Beiping; and Tadashi Araki secretly visited foreign churches to investigate their addresses and properties. These events echoed the issues of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang independence. As for the fact that "inferior goods" are flooding the provinces of North China, even causing the Jiaoji Railway to become "prosperous," we look to the future but do not want to speak of it, nor can we bear to speak of it, for we are also "filled with many emotions that cannot be fully expressed in a single sentence."</p>
<p>The ancients said: "Trust is the foundation of a nation. Only with prestige can one gain trust." Under such circumstances of the guest dominating the host, the situation in North China is probably truly, as Mr. Tang said, "not optimistic." What shall we do?</p>

<p>– Skinny</p>
<p>Wife is an ominous word. Those who have wives generally do not love their wives, but only their lovers. Lovers are truly sweet things. No matter how good a wife is, she is still ordinary because you have "played" with her for too long. Therefore, you do not appreciate her goodness. A lover, on the other hand, is someone you can approach but not get too close to, and the relationship is often semi-public. You cannot fully enjoy the pleasure, so you feel that the aftertaste is incomplete and especially worth cherishing. Therefore, the ancients said it well: "A wife is not as good as a concubine, a concubine is not as good as a maid, a maid is not as good as something stolen, and something stolen is not as good as something you cannot steal." This truly explains the secret of wives and lovers. People just like to do things secretly. The more secretive it is, the more novel it feels. Once it becomes public, it becomes bland. Desire is a strange thing.</p>
<p>Why do people only love lovers and not wives? Ordinary people think that this is due to the human nature of "loving the new and disliking the old." But that is not the case. It is entirely determined by objective society and material relations. When human society first began, the union of the two sexes was originally natural and instinctive. Later, due to the emergence of property relations, and unfortunately these property relations were seized by men, women became appendages of men, and then playthings. After years of ritual and education, women became a slave class forever under the rule of men. Now, as the essence of society changes from a feudal economy to a capitalist economy, the status of women also changes. It transforms from a feudal nature to a capitalist nature, which means that women were previously regulated by rituals and education, but now they are regulated by money. In the past, women were victims of feudal rituals and education; now, they are victims of the money of capitalists. In the past, women succumbed to rituals and education; now, women succumb to money. In the past, women were prisoners of rituals and education; now, women are prisoners of money. Women have transformed from chaste women and virtuous women under the feudal rituals and education to commodities in the market of capitalist society that can be bought and sold by anyone with money. This is the current situation. From the above, we can see that women have become appendages of men from the beginning due to social material relations. The reason why women have become playthings, allowing men to display their instinct to dislike the old and love the new at any time, and why women cannot independently advocate their union with the opposite sex, is because these social material relations have destroyed the natural union of the two sexes based on human instinct, creating this unequal phenomenon between men and women. We can understand this clearly from the above explanation.</p>
<p>Because the union of the two sexes is now not due to instinctive natural requirements but due to material relations, there is no so-called loving union between the two sexes except for naked vested interests. No matter how thick you say love is, in the final analysis, it is just a combination of vested interests. However, this fundamental vested interest is often concealed by the passionate desire on the surface. The beautiful women embraced by the young masters can also be said to be a union of love on the surface, but in fact, who dares to say that they were not bought with money? If they were not bought with money, then why do the beautiful women in the world belong exclusively to the rich, while poor scholars can only find some unremarkable ordinary women? Since the current union of the two sexes is entirely based on naked vested interests rather than on instinctive natural union, its foundation is understandably unstable. Since a man can buy this woman with money, he can certainly buy another woman with money. On the woman's side, since she can sell herself to this man because of vested interests, she can certainly sell herself to someone else when these vested interests change, that is, when this man cannot satisfy the woman's desires. In this way, marriage becomes a sin, love becomes shaken, and everyone sighs that marriage and love have completely gone bankrupt.</p>
<p>Has marriage and love really gone bankrupt? "Marriage is the tomb of love." Is marriage really the tomb of love? Of course not! As long as the material relations of this society change, all problems can be solved.</p>

<h3 id="e294">Is Marriage the Tomb of Love? <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Xinzi</p>
<p>(Part 1)</p>
<p>The question of whether marriage is the tomb of love has only become apparent and loudly proclaimed in modern times. Especially after the evil arrows of capitalism have spread throughout the world, many bizarre and complex phenomena that people cannot clearly explain have occurred. There is no way to correctly resolve the entangled major issue of marriage and love, so people passively shout: Marriage is the tomb of love. Recently, New Shanghai published Ms. Ruizhu's "Marriage is Not the Tomb of Love," which is exactly the opposite of her argument. Her argument is almost derived from the empty conclusion she reached through the analysis and proof of her so-called personal experience of marriage. Moreover, she concludes forcefully: "In short, if young men and women can love each other with sincerity and unconditionally, then who says that getting married will not make you feel the pain of love entering the tomb?"</p>
<p>The theories of both sides are one-sided, failing to fully expand, and only superficially describing the external aspect of the phenomenon. They both inherit the ancestral logical method, observing the ever-changing social phenomena of capitalist society with an isolated and static perspective, lightly regarding a corner of social phenomena as objective and true existence.</p>
<p>Originally, both marriage and love are a necessary and reasonable matter that the human race properly needs both physiologically and mentally. It has no sin in itself. That is, both marriage and love are basic things necessary for the social life of the human race. So why do reasonable things cause many tragedies and become as terrible as entering a tomb in people's eyes? This is entirely the fault given to it by the bad economic foundation of society! Let's turn over the history of the development of married life and we can understand that marriage has not been sending love to the grave from the beginning. It was not until a certain stage of social life changed, giving marriage pain, causing many tragedies or after marriage, which strongly affect love. Therefore, in the feudal society, people dared not file for divorce due to the authority of the old etiquette. When it came to capitalist society, people could freely combine and separate, so the question was loudly raised, thinking that love is sacred and joyful, and marriage is annoying and painful. Indeed, under such an unreasonable social system, people's married life has therefore produced many unreasonable phenomena, but these are all reflections of the miserable social life given to them!</p>

<p>When I was about to attend the second class in the morning, I received a letter from Man. Seeing his large handwriting, my hands were already shaking. What's more, the letter really reported bad news to me: he was sick. My heart was beating, and my whole body felt a little cold as if the blood was contracting. I didn't know what to do!</p>
<p>That class was with Huan Qin. I didn't have time to ask for leave, so I asked Xiao Chen and Mr. × to explain, and immediately ran out of the school gate. Usually there are so many rickshaws, but today there were none. It seemed like they were deliberately making things difficult for me and hiding. The section of road from the Chinese area to the concession didn't feel annoying usually, but today when people have something on their minds and want to walk fast, the stones and mud on the road are hindering your movement, which is really killing me. After running across the bridge, I was covered in sweat. It took me a long time to see a rickshaw. I didn't bother to bargain with him, sat down and told him to run fast. He was really running with all his might, but the speed of my hope was always much faster than his running. Compared to him, my heart seemed to be running like a car, while his legs were walking like an ox cart, which really made me angry. I kept telling him to hurry up, and thinking about it calmly, I also found it funny. Usually when I sit in a rickshaw, I like to see the trees by the roadside, paying attention to whether they are sprouting and growing leaves, or looking at the men and women walking on the road, commenting on this and that. Today, I can't see anything in my eyes, and I imagine Man's sick appearance in front of me, and I'm anxious to know what disease he has. The last time I saw him a few days ago, wasn't he still fine? How could he have gotten sick? I suddenly remembered reading in the newspaper that the weather has been unstable since spring, and there are many patients, especially children with smallpox, and there are even more people with colds everywhere. Does he have a cold? Does he have smallpox? No, smallpox is a children's disease, how could he have smallpox!</p>
<p>After getting out of the car, I hurriedly knocked on his door, entered the door, went upstairs, and when I entered his room, I saw that he had put down the burden he was carrying, and relaxed.</p>
<p>He only had a minor illness, so I was relieved.</p>
<h3 id="e297">On the Future of Movie Stars <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>Due to the economic downturn, all businesses have been severely hit, and people of all salary classes are particularly terrified. Unfortunate encounters such as salary reductions and layoffs are recorded in the news almost every day. Not to mention other things, just looking at the insecure state of life of practitioners in the film industry is enough to make people sigh.</p>
<p>Because they feel that the future is bleak and the current supply cannot be met, everyone has planted the desire to change careers. The brave ones go to implement it, and there are certainly not a few who are hesitant, but everyone has this kind of psychology to some extent. And becoming a dancer has become an outlet for ordinary female movie stars when there is no way out. Their reasoning is: the income of dancers is much stronger than that of movie actors. In order to obtain a comfortable material environment, they would rather do that kind of life being embraced than continue to work hard as a movie actor, which is of course much more enjoyable. This fact has been proven by Liang Saizhen before, and yesterday a newspaper also reported that Xuan Jinglin is also going to be a dancer. Although there are not many initiators yet, it is difficult to predict who will follow in the future. Originally, changing from a movie star to a dancer is just a personal career change, which is not worth making a fuss about. However, under this kind of continuous occurrence, we cannot completely ignore it. Is it only when movie stars have no other choice that they become dancers, or have they already recognized that dancers are the only way out? If they are only for their own material life and abandon their work and tasks to accommodate a luxurious life that only cares about the present, then there is no meaning to speak of, and it is not desirable for wise people. The film career is certainly difficult, but it does not seem to be in a situation where there is no way to maintain it, and the future of the film is not without the possibility of development. If you work hard a little bit, you may gain more in the future. In terms of social views, it is always more meaningful than being a dancer.</p>
<p>In short, if you simply become a dancer because you are dazzled by the temptation of material desires, no matter how sufficient the reason is, it cannot be regarded as a correct behavior. As for those who intend to use the trademark of a star to promote their business, it not only insults the star's own reputation, but also is a scum in the film industry. All those who are truly engaged in the film industry should pay serious attention to prevent the occurrence of similar events, so that the film front will not form a collapse, and save the film industry in case of emergency.</p>

<p>— Ren</p>
<p>It's raining again. The water droplets on the roof tiles are dripping on the steps, and the gusts of wind are also embellishing this quiet space. The glass is shaking against each other, suffering the impact of the wind. There is a deathly silence on the earth except for the dripping rain on the steps and the ticking clock in front of the window. Ah! Rainy night, rainy spring night!</p>
<p>It's midnight already, and the one who is patiently waiting has not returned yet. Maybe she will only be able to return at dawn tonight... She is already intoxicated in the arms of another man. But I dare not think like this, it's too terrible.</p>
<p>Another gust of wind and rain passed, hitting the doors and windows, making them rattle.</p>
<p>A worried person is ultimately a worried person. My whole head is burning, and I can't sleep no matter how I toss and turn. Terrible images are reflected in front of my eyes: the jazz music is anesthetizing the youth, she must be throwing herself into the arms of a gentleman, his hands are tightly hugging her, and his mouth chewing betel nut is sweetly kissing her...</p>
<p>It was also in such a rainy spring that I met her in her hometown. At that time, she was still a shy country girl. When she saw me, a young man returning from the metropolis, she couldn't help but fall in love with me. We once loved each other, and now we have become a nominal couple with different dreams in the same bed. We returned to Shanghai, and she was infected by the city and became who she is now.</p>
<p>In spirit, she is no longer my person. Yes! Nothing is better than the temptation of material things! Ah, the edification of urbanization, the powerful temptation of matter, has turned a country girl into a modern lady.</p>
<p>In the sleepless night, in the pouring spring rain, I curse the sins of this metropolis, and I keep shedding sad tears...</p>
<h3 id="e299">Temptation <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— Xingqiao</p>
<p>There are so many temptations in the big metropolis!</p>
<p>Occasionally running on the road, passing by the entrance of a large company, the things inside the large glass windows are reflected into my eyes one by one: what suits, ties, shirts, leather raincoats, leather shoes,... there is nothing that is not beautiful; what canned food, biscuits, chocolate,... there is nothing that is not delicious; what radios, phonographs,... there is nothing that is not fun. I want it, I want to take it all back.</p>
<p>As usual, looking at the newspaper, turning to the advertising page, many large characters are reflected into my eyes again; what "Grand Theater is showing ××× passionate blockbuster today," what "Cathay Theater is performing ×× dance troupe from today," what "Tianchan Stage ××× complete ×××, best play..." what "Shanghai Ballroom is holding a tea dance party tonight... and invites Ms. ×× to perform ××", what... I want to see them all, I want to have the ability to be in multiple places at the same time and see them all.</p>
<p>Staying at home all day! A car passes in front of the door, the horn honks! I want to sit in a car again, I want to have a lover accompany me to sit in a car; many tall foreign houses are reflected outside the window, how happy it is to live in a foreign house, I thought again; the big sign of "×× Western Restaurant" was also seen by me at the same time. Ah! It's so delicious to eat Western food.</p>
<p>At night, the red and green electric lights flicker far outside the window, which is very bright, and half of the sky is red. I even think of the electric lights, there must be a chorus of flutes and sheng, and the singing must be melodious! There must be many people who are drunk, embracing from left to right! Ah! The moving music, the intoxicating wine, the charming woman's flesh! How happy! How satisfying! Go! I can't wait to fly over and get into this gentle village to enjoy myself.</p>
<p>The temptations in the big metropolis! You are the greatest enemy of young people!</p>

<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>In order to commemorate my deceased father and grandmother, I always return to my hometown once a year to sweep the tomb as usual. This is considered fulfilling the duty of a son!</p>
<p>Although it is already spring these days, there is no warmth at all, and it is still very cold. Moreover, the weather is so dry that the water in the river is almost drying up.</p>
<p>I took the 8 o'clock express train to Suzhou on March 7; in some places, because the water was too shallow, the small steamship stopped running. We specially hired a small gasoline boat. When we arrived at Xukou, the northwest wind howled again. Later, we still drove back to Muduo, preparing to open again early tomorrow morning. After dinner: after 7 o'clock, I saw that the wind seemed to be quiet. So everyone discussed taking a night boat. At this time, fortunately, the sky was full of many stars, and the light from the stars could vaguely distinguish all the scenery in nature. We arrived at our hometown at 11 o'clock, a hometown that we had been away from for a long time.</p>
<p>The god of night opened his huge wings, shrouding the entire earth. In the desolate mountains and fields, everything seemed silent, so silent that it was terrible!</p>
<p>At this time, the shops in the town were all closed. Before my eyes, there were only a few vertical and horizontal streets, lying quietly. There was no place to buy lights, so I had to grope by the light of some stars. The rugged roads and the dilapidated bridges really made me feel that it was difficult to move my feet. The cold air was unbearable for us. But, we finally found our old home, which was a dilapidated house with three rafters, guarded by an inheriting grandmother. However, although I had only not seen this grandmother for a year, she was even more old and decrepit.</p>
<p>The next day, the weather was so clear. We prepared sacrifices and paper money to go to the graves of our grandfather and father to pay our respects.</p>
<p>When I stepped on the cemetery mountain and patrolled the tombs of my grandmother and father, I thought of my father and recalled my grandmother, and I couldn't help but let two lines of tears wet my clothes. The remains of my grandmother and father seemed to be emerging in front of my eyes; but, but, how did they know that I, this unfilial grandson, was missing them here? They can't come to comfort my empty soul. They worked hard all their lives, only leaving us a few mountains, a few fields, and a few houses, but my grandmother died so young that my grandfather died, and my father left the world so young, and my mother had already been widowed for a long time. I am now also the father of a child. So, what will I leave to my child? What will I have to comfort the deceased grandmother and father, and a living mother? I can only be ashamed!</p>
<p>Recently, I saw myself in the mirror, and I was so old. A young man in his twenties was so old, which really shocked me!</p>

<p>"When I was sensible, a foreign dollar was worth two thousand copper coins, and one copper coin was worth two pieces of tofu, that is, meat was only a few dozen pennies; now it's the opposite, what copper plates do you want? One dollar only has two hundred and ten copper plates, and a tael of fish costs at least a few copper plates. How can you be a human being like this? I'd rather be a dog in peacetime than a citizen in troubled times. It's tiring to be a human being these days." Every time the conversation ends, it's always my mother's old saying. Although the old woman says she hates being a human being, she works hard every day, taking care of the fields and managing the household, helping her son support the lives of three people. The mother likes to tell her sons about the good things when she was young. In fact, since Ah Xing understood human affairs, didn't the family not eat a piece of white meat or a bowl of dry rice all year round except for a few major festivals? Didn't the mother also cry in distress when paying rent? Isn't she also working like a machine? Suffering from hunger, cold, and bullying? However, the mother was just energetic at that time and could handle it. What about now? Uncertainty and sadness become apparent with the mother's age and disappointment. Ah Xing was afraid to look at the mother's pensive, lifeless eyes, poured the porridge, which was almost all sweet potatoes, into his stomach, and hurriedly left.</p>
<p>In the east, the sun has not yet risen, only a few peach-colored clouds, the clear sky, and the mood of a girl are so quiet, and the space is filled with the refreshing breath of plants. Children sing mountain songs, leading cattle towards the small mountains to start their carefree, naughty, and romantic lives. Birds open their clear throats and sing melodiously. Ah Xing was intoxicated in the beautiful scenery of nature, walking slowly, when suddenly his eyes were covered by two hands.</p>
<p>"Guess who it is!"</p>
<p>"Little Dogzi, you ghost." Ah Xing tore off Little Dogzi's hands, and both of them laughed. They had been used to playing together since they were young, and they were also growing their friendship from laughter, scolding, crying, and fighting; Little Dogzi took Ah Xing's shoulder, and the two of them walked happily.</p>
<p>"Look!" Ah Xing looked in the direction Little Dogzi was pointing, where a group of people gathered, men, women, and children, gesticulating and yelling.</p>
<p>"Heaven has unpredictable winds and clouds, and people have unpredictable disasters!"</p>
<p>"Having lived for sixty or seventy years, it's changed, the world is coming to an end!" Old man Jixiang, Uncle Shunxing's uncle, a strange old man, he didn't want to be a subject of the Qing Dynasty, or wait for the emperor to ascend the Dragon Pavilion to be sealed, but he stubbornly insisted for no apparent reason, perhaps to miss the past, he kept a silver-white braid as thick as chopsticks, coiled on his head; at this time he was also shaking his head, marveling with worldly experience.</p>
<p>In Uncle Shunxing's field, some of the rice that had been knocked down was draped with a gray suit and a student hat, but the hat was also gray. Apart from going to the city or when the army went to the countryside, people in the village could only see such things; these rare things brought back the sadness and terror of being pushed and donated, which was even more terrible and ominous than the division of the dead. They all kept a distance, and no one dared to touch it. Today, Aunt Shunxing, who rarely goes out, is also standing here holding her son, locking her eyebrows, reddening her eyes, and constantly looking at the sidewalk with her head stretched out, looking very anxious.</p>

<h3 id="e302">Details of the Rasputin Case (Part 1) <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Cang Sang</p>
<p>MGM Sued for Insinuation</p>
<p>Former Russian Grand Duchess Seeks Compensation for Losses</p>
<p>The former Russian royal family sued in the British court because the film "Rasputin" insulted the princess, demanding that MGM compensate for losses of £25,000. This case caused a sensation for a while, and this publication has also published simple information. This case is not only an important event in the film industry, but also a major public case in history, so the details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Rasputin was a demon in Russia during the European War. The name of the film is "The Mad Monk Rasputin." The silent film was shown in Shanghai, and the sound film starred the Barrymore siblings. It was originally scheduled to premiere at the Grand Theater, but it was abandoned for fear of causing trouble with White Russians. The plaintiff in this case is Princess Irina, the niece of the former Russian Tsar, and the wife of Prince Youssoupoff, who lives in Paris. The plaintiff's accusation is that Princess Natasha in the film insinuates her. The defendant, MGM, refuted that Natasha was just a fictional object and had nothing to do with Princess Youssoupoff. After the trial began, the jurors reviewed the content of the film.</p>
<p>Princess Irina is the only surviving member of the former Russian royal family. Her mother is now in England and is the sister of the deceased Tsar. Her father was one of the grand dukes and a nephew of the Tsar. Prince Youssoupoff is also a rare survivor of the former Russian royal family. His ancestors were Tatar kings before being conquered by Russia and owned vast estates before the revolution. The prince and princess were married in 1914. They both testified when the case opened.</p>
<p>This film depicts Rasputin's history in the early years of the Great War. Prince Youssoupoff hated his evil deeds in the court and killed him, thinking it was his duty to remove the violence from the Russian people. Therefore, this film is actually a tragedy, involving the Tsar, the Empress, and the Crown Prince. The love scene is said to involve suspicion of the princess. The script begins with the 30th anniversary celebration of the Romanov dynasty in the Moscow court in 1913. Princess Irina announced her engagement to Prince Youssoupoff at this grand banquet. In 1914, they held a grand wedding in front of the Emperor.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after the wedding night, the European War broke out, and Rasputin appeared. He was originally a peasant with some sorcery, so people regarded him as a monk. He was extremely rude and used sorcery to make money. Coincidentally, the young Crown Prince suffered from a strange disease that no one could cure. The Empress loved him very much, so she was very anxious. Famous doctors from all over Europe were summoned, but the Crown Prince still bled and was in critical condition. Rasputin obtained a secret recipe in Tibet, claiming that he could cure it. He later cured him, so the Empress was grateful and kept him in the palace. The Prince could not leave him for a moment. Rasputin's power in the court was therefore more prominent than the Tsar. The Russian court and the public looked at him with disapproval, recognizing his position as a threat. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e303">Review of "Puppet Love" <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Cang Sang</p>
<p>“I Am Suzanne”丨Great Shanghai丨</p>
<p>"Puppet Love" is a very rare satirical drama, with profound ideas and exquisite techniques, undoubtedly making it a miracle of cinematic art. After viewing it, one can both burst into laughter and cry out loud. It profoundly satirizes the world's people rushing back and forth in the arena of fame and fortune. To outsiders, it's nothing more than a puppet show. Once pointed out, it's hard not to burst into laughter. On the other hand, being used as beasts of burden until exhausted, broken-legged, and voiceless without self-pity, one can't help but cry aloud when looking back. The key to all this lies in whether one is awakened or not. If one can suddenly awaken, it echoes the Buddhist saying of "the four elements are empty" and "turning back is the shore." Otherwise, one can only be pulled by strings as a puppet for life, living a drunken dream. Isn't everything in this world like this? This film makes one feel the pain more keenly and deeply.</p>
<p>The story of this drama is ordinary, but its artistic success is extremely rare and valuable. I can say with certainty that this is the masterpiece of the talented and versatile Lilian Harvey. The ideas conveyed by this film are profound, but without the singing, dancing, and vivid performance of Lilian Harvey as the protagonist, no one could achieve such deeply moving results. Director and screenwriter Lee Rowland was able to utilize Lilian Harvey's skills, arranging and developing them to a superb level, adding to the elements of this film's success, and his contribution is also indelible. Lilian Harvey and Lee Rowland truly deserve the compliment of complementing each other. It is said that this is Lilian Harvey's farewell film as she is tired of screen life and about to retire. Therefore, director Lee Rowland, pitying that she has always been praised as a red star but is actually just a cash cow for Hollywood, specially wrote this "Puppet Love" drama to express his farewell intentions. Mr. Lee is indeed a thoughtful person.</p>
<p>This film has important value in cinematic art. Now, I will briefly mention a few points to summarize the rest. First, the overall arrangement is appropriate. Because the main theme of this film is to satirize the puppet life, some people are treated as puppets, and some puppets are treated as people. These two opposite scenes are performed alternately, one scene tight after another, one scene grand after another. Those who are treated as puppets, are clothed, fed, and enriched there, depicted vividly. In this situation, the one who is revered as a puppet is a dancer named Suzanne. The name "Miss Suzanne" is repeatedly emphasized in advertisements, on the nameplate of her room, and in people's mouths. And the puppeteer, whose purpose is to collect money, is dressed in a high hat and formal attire, appearing as a person of high standing. His high hat and formal attire are never removed, which has deep meaning. On the other hand, those who treat puppets as people express a cynical meaning. Countless puppets, dressed in formal attire, of various shapes and colors, form a grand sight, which is indeed an excellent negative example.</p>
<p>Second, the transformation of the overall situation is the most profound and colorful. The plot of this film leads to the ultimate ideal of love. What reminds the puppets to start anew is not fame and fortune but love. This point is the most brilliant. For example, "Miss Suzanne" vaguely sees in a dream that a large rope is first put around her neck, and then she is bound all over by a spiderweb. Then, in the magnificent background, there are demons, flames, and night forks. Lilian Harvey then performs her superb skills, trying her best to depict the struggle, and finally throwing herself into the flames. A flash of green light, the scene changes rapidly, turning the living hell into the human world. "Miss Suzanne" awakens to the way of being human in this dream and becomes "I Am Suzanne."</p>
<p>Third, the dialogue is very commendable. The profound ideas conveyed by this film owe much to the dialogue. The playwright's harsh criticism of people's puppeteering in the play is also a successful point. This is limited by space, so readers should understand it themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e304">Review of "Flame" <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>丨丨Beijing Screening丨丨</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Who says spring has come to the world? When I came out of the Beijing Grand Theater, weren't everyone shrinking their necks and shouting cold? "This is winter in spring," I thought.</p>
<p>In this bitter rain and bleak wind, I recalled the impression that "Flame" gave me.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Flame! This drama title should be so magnificent. As the author declared to us, the flame is constantly burning. Burning down half of the landscape of the Northeast, burning down the prosperity of Shanghai, and even spreading along both banks of the Yangtze River. Millions of victims are fleeing and crying in the flames! They are burned down by the flames, they are destroyed by the flames. But who will extinguish these flames? Who will save these millions of victims? The world is full of people watching the fire from across the river, just like the demeanor of the gentlemen and ladies laughing by the river, as implied in the film. We can only save ourselves, using our own strength, to extinguish these flames, and in the ashes and embers, build our own heaven on earth.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Indeed, the playwright has a new worldview. He unfolded the future of the national war in an extraordinary way in his work. When A-Gui saw the raging fire of Zhabei, he rang the alarm, he called on the vast masses of laborers who rushed out of the broken houses, and fought for themselves in loud shouts. In addition, he also told us that when the flames are burning down the thatched huts, there are no firefighters and no firefighting tools, so they have to watch the destruction of their own property, and at the same time, they are ridiculed for watching the fire from across the river. But when entertainment carelessly causes a fire in a tall foreign house, it is also a fire, but there are scientific fire trucks to extinguish it. Moreover, you can immediately get a large amount of compensation from the insurance company, and soon you can rebuild a new villa. The flames will not cause them any damage.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Then, how does director Hu Rui understand this script? Did he grasp the center of gravity of the play?</p>
<p>Obviously, he avoided the important and emphasized the unimportant. He particularly exaggerated the love part. On the contrary, he lightly passed over the aforementioned center of gravity of the play, even using a hesitant tone. This is an undeniable fact. But why does the director do this? Although we will not ignore that people have different difficulties, it cannot but be the most painful thing for artists to make a discount on their own works in order to adapt to the environment. We certainly sympathize with the author's old heart, but he must recognize the author's timidity.</p>
<p>It is said that the original script stated that the fire in the thatched hut was caused by the sparks from the landlord's banquet, but in the picture, we see the carelessness of A-Gui's wife. From this example, the author did indeed automatically delete a lot.</p>
<p>According to Yihua Company, this film is "not cut in size". If this is true, then Chinese films have great hope. Otherwise, the author has cleverly done it to the extent that it is "not cut in size".</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>Regarding technical issues, the photography is excellent, and the coordination of lighting is a rare achievement in Chinese films. The camera is also very lively, but some places (such as chicken hearts or nine-pointed stars, etc.) are counterproductive. The acting skills of the actors are also quite commendable, but Hu Ping is not realistic enough when playing the role of a farm girl in the first part.</p>
<p>As for the director's rhythm, it is not proficient enough. I think slow motion destroys the tense atmosphere, and the fire fighting scene should be shorter and faster. If you use slow motion and cannot show calm force, then it is undoubtedly a failure.</p>

<p>"Cloud Dress and Beautiful Melody" is the crystallization of the cooperation between Warner Brothers and First National Pictures of America. The original English name is Fashions of 1934. This film will be shown in Nanjing soon. The three major films produced by the company last year, namely "42nd Street", "Gold Diggers of 1933", and "Footlight Parade", have long been well-known, but "Cloud Dress and Beautiful Melody" is far superior to them in terms of famous songs, wonderful dances, and plot. There is an exhibition of new-style clothing in 1934, which exposes the secrets of Parisian fashion art. The ladies and celebrities in Shanghai who love beauty must be eager to see it first.</p>

<p>— Wen Yin</p>
<p>Will apologized to Joanna very awkwardly. He said his mother certainly hadn't ordered the blacks to do that... If she had known, she wouldn't have agreed... He then asked Joanna to attend the dance. Joanna shook her head and refused. Will said his mother would love to meet her, that his whole family would love for her to come. He begged her earnestly. Joanna felt a little embarrassed because of the flowers just now, as if she was being petty, but Will said he had come specifically to invite her. So, because of his earnest attitude, Joanna knew his words were false, but she couldn't refuse outright, so she agreed.</p>
<p>It was already evening that day. Connerly sat in a large chair, watching pairs of dancers waltzing gracefully. Her daughter, Geraltine, stood beside her. Mrs. Connerly said to Geraltine, "Will is dancing with that girl again." Her voice was low, but filled with suppressed anger. She continued, "If I had known Will was so brainless... I wouldn't have invited that girl Butters... Alas, those flowers were too expensive..." The mother and daughter stared. That slender figure, wearing simple and unadorned clothes, was gracefully spinning in Will's arms, her eyes shining as she looked at Will's face. Once, Geraltine complained to her mother, "It's no use you inviting Jack Huntington. Can't you see he's been chasing after Florentine all night?"</p>
<p>Robert walked up. He drank a lot of cipio made by himself, because he didn't like drinking that fruit water. He asked Mrs. Connerly with drunken eyes, "How's the dance going, the joyful dance?" Mrs. Connerly shook her head and said, "Will is outrageous, he's being so unfair to Florentine." Old Robert said, "That's good for Florentine. Sometimes a man's attitude..."</p>
<p>"A little cold will make a woman kinder." He finished speaking and chuckled. Mrs. Connerly complained to him, "What good is that for Will?" After a while, she looked at Joanna's slender figure and muttered to herself, "She's simply a vixen."</p>
<p>"She's not welcome here." Robert said, "I welcome her, she reminds me of my lost youth." Mrs. Connerly bit her lip and said resentfully, "Unfortunately, Will's behavior also reminds me of... I still approve of your youth, forever buried and motionless."</p>
<p>Joanna suddenly felt uneasy, she had already noticed that Mrs. Connerly's eyes were too stern... Robert's eyes were also a little strange... Will seemed to know her unease, he led Joanna to the garden, where there was a hammock made from the body of an old carriage, suspended from an oak tree with a few ropes. Will and Joanna sat down. He sat beside her, feeling how lovely and respectable she was. His heart was beating. His hand curved around behind her and encircled her fragrant shoulders. He chatted about the past stories of Connerly Mansion, several famous figures in the history of the Civil War, all of whom had been entertained there. Joanna's head leaned back, resting on Will's broad shoulder, she listened as if intoxicated. The night was so lovely... The scenery was so endearing... She felt as if she was a longtime resident here... She was dreaming like this when suddenly someone called Will. (To be continued)</p>
