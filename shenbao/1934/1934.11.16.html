<p>時評</p>
<h3>史總經理今日大殮</h3>
<p>本報總經理史先生被難後之三日。大殮於滬寓正寢。同人等仰瞻先生遺容。豊頰秀眉。博唇方口。神采奕奕。不減生前。然而哲人云亡。終無以起先生於地下。不亦痛哉。夫生離死別。古今所悲。卽分屬陌路。亦覺傷心。矧同人等之與先生。分甘共苦。合志同道。啟欬常親。意氣相投。此情此景。歷歷如耠。何竟幽明間隔。陰陽歧途。相對咫尺。不獲以片言隻字為慰。二十年來舊賓主。僅得今日一面。更不可再。嗚呼。</p>
<p>昔人云。一棺附身。萬事都已。人生到此。天道寗論。先生蓋棺在卽。此生形骸。已至蛻化。身後哀榮。更何所計。然先生之遣澤在人。初不因其死而絕。先生之事業長存。初不因其歿而斬。凡此皆經數十年慘澹經營之功。銖積寸累。乃有今日。是其所以得傳。固非偶然者可比也。先生慘遭橫禍。死不瞑目。所可引以自慰者。其在斯乎。</p>
<p>世有［蓋棺論定］之說。以為人生變幻。莫可測度。一人之忠侫。真偽。功過。是非。往往至死而後能定。然此則非所語於先生也。蓋先生言忠信。行篤敬。誠以待人。和以接物。與世無忤。與人無爭。綜其畢生之所為。惟知矢志服務於與論界。以為推動社會進化之一助。行有馀力。則從事於社會公益及生產建設。惠及災黎與夫窮極而無告者。先生固雄於資。尤能見義勇為。樂善不倦。所謂［富而好施］者。先生有焉。先生蜚聲於國內外者。歷有年所。以其在與論界之成就獨大。夙有中國北巖爵士之目。而其贊助公益慈善事業之熱列。亦為舉世所推崇。此在先生固謙遜未遑。而論者仍以是歸之。有以知先生之事業功德。久有定評。初無待同人等今日之費辭也。</p>
<p>先生之噩耗既傳。唁電弔辭。雪片飛來。而中外報界同業。著論贊揚。情見乎辭。此先生家屬與同人等之所感激無既者也。天下假先生以年。使長為同人等之圭臬。誠可遺憾。幸而先生之精神不死。典型永存。敢不勉承遣志。繼續努力。所能報効知遇於萬一者。惟此而已。</p>

<h3>英美談判三小時半協商對日新局勢</h3>
<p>日本再取探詢態度</p>
<p>現慮提議遠東問題</p>
<p>倫敦英美日海軍談話已歷多日、其結果或將締結海軍新約、以代華盛頓海軍公約、聞新約將涉及每國之讓步、五。五。三比率之保留、許日本原則上之平等、限制主力艦為三萬噸、許英國得置巡洋艦七十艘、此為英國在會議中始終所堅持者也、當改訂各艦門類時、將力圖迎合每國之要求、卽許日本多置潛艇、許美國多置大戰艦與飛機母艦、許英國多置巡洋艦是、據美代表方面消息、美國海軍界或將於上述之一條有所讓步、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦英美海軍代表今日集議三小時半之久、德英方消息、所討論者均為空泛之點、或與日本無直接關係之點、美代表於散會後語新聞訪員、謂英代表會請彼等對談話情形嚴守秘密、此言足徵談話現已入於錯綜合點、美方覺英代表中現意見分歧、有不惜任何代價以求遷就日本者、有立於美國方面者、聞美代表乃堅持五。五。三之比率、雙方今日曾述及明年海軍大會事、惟將否舉行、現不可必、但據英國負責方面稍遲宣稱、美代表對於今日海軍談話會具有英代表意見分歧之印象、絕非事實、今日之集談、並未更變關於一九三五年大會之局勢、大會希望之佳、不減於前云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦昨日英美代表間之談話注重日本廢止華盛頓公約後所引起之局勢、聞英代表曾以籌備締結上述海軍新約問題商諸美代表、此項問題已由美代表電逹華盛頓、現正靜待羅斯福總統之訓示、美方對於英代表昨日所提新途徑之希望、顯抱樂觀、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦日本政府始終反對倫敦海軍會議討論政治問題、然英美兩國政府均以日本廢除華盛頓條約之事為與遠東政治問題有關、將於會議進展之際、擬提起關於中國問題之新協定或共同宣言、尤其美國臺維斯代表已經迭次言及關於中國之九國條約及四國條約之審議、頓堪注目、（十四日日聯電）</p>
<h3>廣田訓令松平探詢英真意</h3>
<p>保留具體答覆</p>
<p>東京海軍與外務兩當局、對於英國首相麥唐納於七日向日代表松平提出之妥協案、現正在慎重協議、當由廣田外相於十五日訓令松平山本兩代表、茲錄其電文大要如下、吾人對於英國欲成全軍縮會議之態度、表示滿腔敬意、但日本政府所開陳之軍縮方針、乃為完成軍縮大乘起見、而要求軍備平等之原則、故英國之真意是否能滿足日本政府之主張、尚不無若干疑問存乎其間、是以關於此點、仍望繼續折衝為要、云云、以上訓令欲將英國對於試辦妥協案之意圖明白探詢、不過表示日本方面之態度、至於是否承認尚須保留其答覆、蓋以英國試辦方案認為僅係討論性質、不必由日本代表團給與正式答覆、而處於自由之立塲、使之探詢英國之真意耳、（十五日日聯電）</p>
<p>東京上星期英國向日代表提出之折衷方案、由外相廣田與海軍省當局審慎研究後、今日已電令日大使松平及海軍談話日總代表山本對英國願根據紳士協定於名義上承認日本海軍平等、而由每國宣布其海軍建築所可許之限度一節、續向英政府詢明一切、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>形勢未緩和英對美遷就</h3>
<p>允維持標準噸位</p>
<p>倫敦本日午後英美兩國海軍代表團在下議院會晤、公同討論海軍一般問題、特別注重本月八日英國為調和美日兩國意見、所提之兩項建議、本日會晤係英國方面昨晚召集者、而討論結果並未能使談話形勢趨於和緩、但談話性質則甚重要、其故以英政府向日方所提之口頭建議、不啻在原則上放棄五。五。三比率、此為美國所反對、倫敦報紙所發表之華盛頓來電、曾率直言之而白宮亦有所表示、本日會晤、乃在討論此項問題、故英美代表團幾於全體出席、英國方面出席者、有首相麥唐納。外相西門。海相孟塞爾。海軍參謀長郤德飛爵士。外交部參事海軍問題專家克萊奇。及九政部專家費歇爵士、美國方面出席者、有諾曼臺維斯。駐英大使館參贊海軍參謀長斯丹萊及專家二人、談話歷三小時之久、散會後有人對報界宣稱、本日談話係就華府海約全部加以討論、卽軍艦噸位與軍盤種類問題、此事本年八月間英美兩國曾經討論、本日美國代表堅稱裝甲艦有維持三萬五千噸之必要、英國則希望低減、據晚間消息、本日談話時、英國代表似已允許維持華府條約所定之標準噸數、此為英國對美國之讓步、但英國所得之代價、不過美國對英國最近所提調和案之第一點或可略將抵抗力減少而已、按英國所提調和案現正由東京政府從事研究、其第一點係承認各簽字國、對於本國國防需要、有自由判斷之權、但每一艦種內各種不同之艦型將從新分配、此層在事實上固足以限制各國海軍自主之權、而使其與華府約原定之比率相去不遠、但承認各國海軍自主權原則、正美國所認為十分重大者、美國向來反對此點、至今依然未改、惟英國口頭建議、並無任何硬性、其所以提出之者、實因當時談話有破裂之虞、故以此避免之、俾談話得以繼續進行耳、東京政府對英國建議所提之問題、或可使談話形勢轉變、而得到出路、東京復方明日可到、究竟能否以新條約代替華府海約、俾海軍軍備競爭得以避免、在數日之內卽可知之云（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美海長宣布改造珍珠港</h3>
<p>需美金百八十萬元</p>
<p>華盛頓海軍部長史璜生今日宣布、海部於本屆經濟年度預算中將列入改造夏威夷珍珠港之費用、根據目前之計劃、此項改造工作包括拕掘及其他改良工程、共需美金一百八十萬元、史氏並謂、改造之後、該港卽可容納全部美國艦隊云、史氏此項宣布頗為重要、因目前倫敦談話已成僵局、而國務當局亦曾承認美國放棄國際軍縮協定成功之希望、至珍珠港則為傳說中美國於海軍條約失敗復擬在太平洋方面鞏固防務四處之一云、（十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>美空軍三年內居世界第一</h3>
<p>現在計劃有無阻力為關鍵</p>
<p>華盛頓美國陸軍飛行隊計劃如不遇阻力、則美國在三年內將有世界中最大而最新之空軍、陸軍飛行隊今日提出預算、請置新機八百架、其中五百架用以代替陳舊不適用之機、此八百架飛機、分三年造成、庶三年後美國共有戰門機二千四百架、設備極新、力量極大、世界空軍將無出其右、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓航空處頃擬具建造飛機八百架之計劃、其中五百架係用以代替陳舊之飛機、其馀三百架則須添造者、美國軍用航空飛機將由此增至二千四百架、海軍方面亦擬建造飛船一艘其體積約為二百五十萬立方呎、作為練習之用、此項計劃、如果批準實行、則美國空軍將成為世界最新式而最強大者、此外陸軍部擬要求二千萬元、以革新陸軍、使其摩托化、美國原有特種軍隊九團、專為美國及海外各屬地防空之用、陸軍部並擬要求一千一百萬元經費、傳以新式器機、供給此種特別軍隊、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓如海軍部現在考慮之計劃成為事實、則美國海軍之大飛艇孟康號不久將飛往夏威夷、海軍部長史璜生今日聲稱、此項長距離飛行係度試騐性質、以決定海軍應否再造大飛艇、據稱如欲變更若干方面之反對態度、惟有孟康號大尺艇能於此次試飛中充份表現其戰鬥力、史璜生繼稱、夏威夷之飛行係開發性質、而由艦隊協助之、史氏復表示海軍不再造飛機甲板巡洋艦因海軍專家認其效力不及普通巡艦也、史氏復證實明年財政年度海軍部建造文生案中戰艦二十四艘之計劃而於一九四二年底逹到條約所許之海軍力、但如有加速進行之必要、則美國船塢亦可於原需時間之半完成造艦計劃云、（十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>英陸相陳述海軍政策</h3>
<p>保全海上交通之艦隊</p>
<p>惟希望避免海軍競爭</p>
<p>倫敦今日上院開會時、陸相海爾珊勳爵曾詳陳帝國防務事宜、先述海軍談話會、謂談話刻猶在進行中、故未能貢獻切實情報、吾人海軍地位之全局、現在依吾人絕對之需要予以甚審慎之考慮、政府希望能成立一種避免海軍軍備競爭、而一方面又許吾人維持必要的艦隊之條約、以代一九三六年滿期之海軍公約、政府不得不考慮量與質的軍縮問題、但維持足以保全吾人海上交通之艦隊、實屬至要、人人對於此點、無庸妄生疑懼、陸相繼言英國應養有足資調遣之陸軍、並詳述擴張空軍程序之進行情形、謂政府曾費八萬鎊建造新加坡空軍根據地、又費五萬鎊建造香港空軍根據地、現正有飛艇一隊、從事測量新加坡與香港聞之航空路綫、目下抵禦敵方轟炸機之可能性、已較歐戰終止時為大、政府之政策、乃在儘力減輕受敵方天空襲擊之危險、陸相末謂政府仍將繼續努力造成密靜之空氣、使國際軍縮得告成功、惟同時並不能漠視所負之責任與片面的軍縮云、前海相斐蒂伯爵起問、戰鬥艦是否艇艦隊中至關重要之一部分、如仍重要則政府對於此事將有何建議、陸相答稱、主力艦實為戰鬥艦隊中之重要分子、不列顯商軍政策之全部機構、唯此是賴、又稱不足供維持海上交通之巡洋艦</p>

<p>中央社云、浙江省政府、為發展地方生產事業、並整理地方債務、發行民國二十三年浙江省地方公債二千萬元、其條例已經行政院會議及立法院通過、於十月一日發行、惟浙省當局、鑒於今年全省災情嚴重、故在生產事業之規定額項下、除撥一部分為急賑外、馀均以工代賑、茲以需欵孔急、已由財政廰長王澂瑩來滬、向銀行界商洽抵借、前昨曾有集議、茲據記者探得各情、分誌如下、</p>

<p>陳氏對新新社記者稱、余於三十年前、遠適海外、艱辛備嘗、幸得白手成家、人多謂找事業成功、孰知成功皆是失敗中來、晉創一業、成一事　中間必經許多次失敗與奮鬥、方克成功、諺云、吃得苦中苦、方為人上人、鑒於近來世界不景氣象、業已成為普遍性、白熱化、馬來亞自亦難獨得倖免、惟近年來土產（如膠錫等）地價等、因各國貨幣戰而上漲、市況亦隨之漸露昭蘇之氣象、惜營國貨進口之目、銀價漲落不定、而大感困難、願我財部除限制外、再實施能使國幣匯價穩定之有效辦法、</p>
<p>文化事業</p>
<p>至於文化方面、則賴華校當局之努力、及各大書坊、競賣祖國新刋物、以廉價出售之結果、華僑教育、近年來有極顯著之進步、此則差為祖國同胞告慰者、鄙人幼年失學、悔之已晚、尤望祖國教育事業之能在海外普及也、</p>
<p>回國原由</p>
<p>本人此次返國、除向中央當局報告星洲最近僑務外、並擬請實業部對於國貨出口、準予概免稅、俾得國貨暢銷海外、以挽回既失之利權、同時赴各地考察國貨、調查商業、故此次返國、與尋常旅行不同、業由星洲中華總商會函請駐星總領事致電中央、轉飭華僑招待所、照案慢待、</p>

<h3>同福輪船遇險證實</h3>
<p>全船員工尚無下落</p>
<p>家屬已向公司請䘏</p>

<p>報告原函</p>
<p>委托代查之報告函、昨已到滬、略稱、同福輪十月廿六日、由otaiu裝樹木開出至本月二日上午、船到高麗洋南岸黑山島遇險求援、村尾會社卽派救生輪至失事地、巡歷三日夜、竟未有形跡、查該輪除貨艙所裝木外、艙面亦有木頭一千馀根、現於各處查察、並向各電臺探詢、經數日之詳查、有稱因貨艙進水而沉、有謂遇大風觸沉、確實如何甚難得知、該輪各員工家屬知否、望卽轉逹為幸、</p>
<p>請求䘏金</p>
<p>連日船員及海員各家屬、於各方調查之下、知全部五十馀人生命、多分已遭隨船沉沒、葬身魚腹矣、被難船員各家屬連日向同安公司交涉、請求撫䘏、使孤兒寡婦、得以生活、包安甫本人、聞在日本、公司方面、另有負責人員、此回輪保險係向日本投保、故對船員家屬請求、尚無切實表示云、</p>

<h3>特載中國憲法的幾個根本問題（四）</h3>
<p>— 范世勤速記。</p>
<p>立法院長孫哲生先生講</p>
<p>七中央與地方的關係</p>
<p>中央與地方的關係、那是中國根本的問題、中國在現在還沒有完全統一、中央的權力是不充分、民國以來、到現在二十多年、內亂不已、軍人到處運用軍法、把持地方、不歸中央、只管自己的組織、與中央反對衝突、過去的民國歷史、都是這些事實、現在憲法有規定著、關於中央與地方的一章、目的是使中國完全統一、不再為軍人所把持、</p>
<p>中國所謂省、與歐洲各國的邦。美國的洲不同、美國當初是十三洲、是英國的殖民地、後來反對英國、纔成為獨立的國家、可知他們在歷史上是先有洲然後有國家、德國也是這樣、他是最近幾十年前、把幾個邦連起來成為德國的、在他的歷史上、也是先有邦、這種邦就是幾個小國、美國之成為合衆國、有他的地位、有他的歷史、德國也是這樣、可是中國則不然、中國是先有國家、才有省的、因為省是從國家內劃分出來的、這種從幾百年來就一直成為中央的行政區、是受中央支配的、外國對這種組織呌做clnspect、地方政府不過是代表中央政府來執行地方的政治、事實上不能獨立的、</p>
<p>中國的歷史、從秦始皇統一以後、廢除了封建制度、二千多年來是完整統一的、所以中國的省與外國的聯邦不同、我們應該根據歷史、對於省的地位認識清楚、有不是獨立的、不過是中央的行政區、中央是省的上級機關、省是不能離開中央的、離開了中央根本就沒有省、在我們的憲法上、對於地方人民、能夠組織起來、人民選舉省長、選舉省議會、中央對於省是直轄的、中央發出的命令給各省、各省收到命令、便執行中央的法律、推行中央的政策、（未完）</p>

<p>小西天</p>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第四回　杯水見離求寒工護老萬金談可致猾吏聯羣</p>
<p>他中意呢，我保險他不花多少錢。不中意，到了這裹來，只要他買盒煙捲請請客，這沒有什麼可推諉的吧？李士廉道：你和他還是初次見面，介紹這件事，恐怕他有些不好意思，不如約在我這里會面，人算是到我這裹來的。願意他就上鉤，不願意與他無干。郭敦品道：只是你也要約好了他，你不約好他回頭我把人帶來了，他又不在小西天，我無所謂，帶來的人，二次就不願再來的了。李士廉道：好的，我先寫個字條去通知他罷。於是就在桌上攤開紙筆墨硯，寫了一張字條，交給茶房，送到賈多才屋子裹去。這位賈先生自昨晚看到了朱月英以後，他覺得天下事總是個緣，何以在西安又會遇到了他，這件事倒不是尋常的際遇，很可以留意的。他心裹即是這樣的想著，就中管籌畫那進行的辦法。這時李士廉寫了一張字條來，倒是深合其意。字條上寫的是：</p>
<p>多才兄：弟已知兄意所在，今天下午七點鐘，請到小弟房間來，燈下看美人，妙哉妙哉？如何如何？盡不盡言，卽請大安。再者，此事係交情性質，並無任何花費等項，知關錦注，合併奉聞，請兄務必按時前來可也。為盼為禱。　弟士廉拜上。</p>
<p>多才看了這字條，也沒有去細揣文理，可是心裹大大的明白，知道是士廉約好了那位姑娘在他屋子裹會　何，就同那位姑娘接洽好了，不過他沒有十二分的把握，不會來約會著七點鐘相會的。他既然有了字條前來，就按時而去。（六五）</p>
<h3>過元慶園</h3>
<p>— 費瑪</p>
<p>去年在杭家裹小住的時候，我常同著二伯到西湖上去跑的，二伯說，他不愛遊水，只愛遊山，因此我和他總是上孤山去喝酒的。那一次我們兩個人都喝醉了，二伯忽然興高采烈的說：［今天是四月八，靈隱寺的香火很盛，我們去耍子耍子吧！］於是，我們就帶著微微的醉意，緩步地在一條長道上走着。</p>
<p>春日的長道上路旁的樹木蔥蘢可愛，和暖的陽光普照著大地的一切，當我們走近一列被蔓草簇擁著的短墻邊，二伯用手指了一下那樹林裹說：［前面就是畫家陶元慶的墓呢。］我隨卽抬頭一看，瞧見那小門上刋著直寫的［元慶園］三個字。</p>
<p>我同二伯就走進了這裹面去。</p>
<p>裏面的墓式樣很新奇，像一座大理石自嗚鐘一樣，上面只刻了四個表示送葬年號的羅馬字，對面角上闢了小池一方，其馀便沒有什麼了，我瞧見墓蓋上寫了這樣幾個鉛筆字：［哥哥，今天我來看過你了，你好好的安息著吧！］我心裹想，這字一定是他妹妹陶思瑾寫的。</p>
<p>二伯向我說：［這元慶園是他一個喜歡做做小說的老朋友許欽文借了債來替他建設的。］他忽然又帶笑的問我：［你記得前年在杭州有一段慘殺案的新聞？］</p>
<p>［是記得的！］我點點頭，他於是又告訴我聽；［現在許欽文同陶思瑾都關在監獄裹，陶思瑾已判處無期徒刑了。］他向我做著一個老年人譏諷的微笑。</p>
<p>這時我同二伯已經走出了元慶園，不知不覺的離開牠數十步以外了，回頭一看，只見那幕被一道半園形的短墻在樹林中寂寞地圍抱着。</p>
<p>我茫然地想到，那在墓蓋上題字的妹妹如今也不幸的身入囹圄，或許將永遠地不能再來謁他這充滿著寂寞的墓地吧？</p>
<h3>泰州燈籠</h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>自從新式桅燈，手電筒，代替了紙糊燈籠的位置，紙燈籠在社會上，遂如秋風吹落葉，永遠瀹在冷宮裹，沒有抬頭的日子。但是窮鄉僻壞，紙燈籠的風情，仍然潛伏在鄉村角落裹閃爍著，紙燈籠在二十世紀的時代，小城市裹一部份人，仍像保存古物船很歡迎的。</p>
<p>紙燈籠在數十年前，最出風頭的時代，在我們江北各縣，要算泰州燈籠製造得最為嬌小玲瓏。該項燈籠、以竹絲為胎，另以白如細絹之紗為衣，上貼以彩紙剪成之種種圖案，然後用桐油約略抹之，待風乾後，點以蠟炬充光綫之亮，較之今日電燈，卻另有一種風度。泰州燈籠在最盛行的時代，業此鍸口的人，約有數千之多，該項燈籠足跡幾遍江南北各縣，今日談起江北手工業之掌故，吾人對此事，尤為之稱道不衰。</p>
<p>關於泰州燈籠之故事；猶憶二十年前興化有王氏女，未婚夫服務於泰州商店，女因肺病危篤，自知生命難免，懇其兄赴泰，向未婚夫索一物，以示情專，而備殉葬之用，伊兄不忍拂其意，遂奉命而往。其時輪船未有，由興赴泰長途百馀里，只藉民船往來，伊兄至泰，適未婚夫往他處辦貨，伊兄無可奈何，遂購一泰州燈籠而歸，以堅妹之信。</p>
<p>女於病榻上覩一絹製燈籠，並聞兄所告，遂取之放於身旁，直至病歿，手執該燈籠而不釋，死後，母兄遂取為殉葬物，因女之精誠所致，視該燈籠如未婚夫之贈物，生為某姓人，死為某姓鬼，女之視燈籠，別有一種純潔之用意，這種哀感動人的故事，至今人們談起來，猶為之惋惜不置。</p>

<h3>蝶戀花</h3>

<p>荒村感，用汪精衛先生赴遼東韻。</p>
<p>雨橫風斜荒漠裹。白了蘆花。赤了躬耕地。古樹昏黃鴉欲墜。紛紛人灑饑寒淚。往矣征人忙堡壘。婦首飛蓬。個個芳心碎。百幾光陰終一死。無情最怕烽煙起。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （輝仙）</p>
<p>在人生道上，不要回頭看，也不要向前望，祇要注意你的腳下。</p>
<p>要不受別人的管束，先要自己管理自己。</p>
<p>在樸質無華的陋屋中，可以得到許多真正的快樂。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲録</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>在天花板上，同樣還有許多飛龍飛鳳一類的點綴品，也是用的純金。而這些庭柱和天花板的本身，不用說，當然都是用的最貴重的木料了。這裹卻祇能用普遍的木料，真金的點綴品是更不見一件了！再有熱河的行宮中，一切門上的門鍵，和那些拴窗的扎鉤之類，大部份都是銀製的，就是不是銀，也必是上好的紫銅或白銅。而這裹，卻祇見普通的黃銅和白鐵，總之。從物質上講，無論拿那一點來比較，熱河的行宮實在要比盛京的古宮富麗得多了！</p>
<p>盛京的宮院之所以不能盡量裝點的緣故，乃是極單純的，一言以蔽之，財力不足而已。東三省的商市，雖然並不如何蕭條，百姓也不曾鬧什麼饑荒：可是這裹的人民，向來習慣於很清苦的生活，奢移的事情，大家都不講究，而官家所徵收的錢糧，也比較少一些，因此這些宮院，在當地人的心目中看來，已是非常的華貴精緻，殊不覺有整治的必要，在官府方面，又為經濟力所限，也只是跟人民抱著相同的心理，儘讓這些陳舊的建築物，永遠維持著它們的原狀了。其實，平心而論，像這樣的屋子，僅僅用以充作皇上或皇太后偶一臨幸時用的行宮，的確已很適合的了，我們這些人都為在關內過了好幾代的舒服生活，不但已把我們的耐苦精神一齊喪失殆盡，而且還使我們養成了一種非常奢侈的習慣。對於等間的物件，不免就存了瞧不起的心理，於是便把這些尚存三分古意的舊宮院，看得處處不見精采了。（一七五）</p>

<h3>釋煉氣</h3>
<p>— 陳師誠</p>
<p>前此張學斌來滬設擂，誇耀其所謂梅花椿，金鐘罩，鐵布衫等種種工夫；中武俠小說毒者，莫不眉飛色舞，以為從此可目睹其理想中之劍仙俠客：亦有函詢國術館以金鐘罩，鐵布衫等工夫，是否實有其事者。可謂轟動一時矣。</p>
<p>友人穆君，嘗以此事相質問。余應之曰梅花椿為少絕技；余友鄧君，其師粵人蔡君，亦曾以斯術嗚，惜已於數年前返粵矣。曰：金鐘罩，鐵布衫如何？余曰：此少林派中內家工夫也。雖以煆炬筋肉為事，然總不出煉氣範圍。穆君矍然曰：余習武十馀年，略窺內外二家門徑。煉氣之說，雖亦屢聞之於師，然終不知氣之果為何物；其即指呼吸之氣耶？抑別有所指耶？質之於師，師含糊不肯以實告。子能為我言之否？</p>
<p>余笑曰：氣字之範圍極廣，子師非不肯言，難言之也。醫家有氣虛氣旺之說，文章有氣盛氣衰之別：技擊家言［力］必帶［氣］字，故不曰［力］，而曰［氣力］。即此而論，已非空氣所謂包括，況氣字之義，尚未盡於此乎！</p>
<p>曰：然則子之所謂［氣］者，果何物耶？余曰：是非立談之所能盡也！約略言之，可分四種：（甲）呼吸之氣（乙）衛外之氣（丙）真元之氣（丁）真一之氣。真一之氣，為道家所發明，亦唯道家獨得其奧。其理玄微，非可言罄，亦非技擊家之所知，姑置不論。國術家所煉者，不甲，乙，丙三種而已。茲分別論之如左：</p>
<p>（甲）呼吸之氣　所謂呼吸之氣者，空氣是也：中含養素（oxyzen）。由鼻吸入，以至於肺。血液經大循環之後，色化為紫，還入心房：復經肺循之作用，得肺中新鮮空氣滌之，去其垢濁，色復為赤，歸於心房。肺中養素，與血中炭素化合而成炭養二（coz）；復自口鼻呼出。人可以數日不食，而不能片刻斷呼吸者，職是故也。人在劇烈運動時，血液之流動，必較常時加速；因之心臘膨脹，呼吸急促，氣塞不得舒。故國術家必虛其心，實其腹，沉其氣，使橫隔膜下凹，擴張肺部，則久鬥不致氣喘。此煉氣之初工，亦外家拳術之所重也。</p>
<p>（乙）衛外之氣　即中醫所謂太陽寒水之氣也。內經以三焦決凟之官；後之醫者，多不知三焦為何物。焦古作瞧，即人身之油膜連綱。凡人飲水入胃，胃有微絲管將水散出，走油膜，入膀胱，其未盡者，至小腹中，又有微絲管將水散出，走下焦以入膀胱，膀胱上口，即在下焦連綱中。此皆下行之水，未化為氣者也。心與肺通，吸入之氣，從肺歷心，引心火循脊入䭆系。由腎系入連綱經佈逹小腸。水之在連綱中者，皆被薰蒸化氣。其未盡之水，則滲入膀胱。膀胱之底，是為氣海，又名血室，乃油膜中一大夾室：道家謂之丹田，醫家謂之胞中。心火既下入腎系，直走連綱抵血室中，薰蒸膀胱之水，皆化為氣，透出氣海循油膜上胸膈以逹於喉：其從油膜四逹者，則走肌肉，出皮毛，是為衛外之氣。醫家統稱小腸膀胱為太陽經者即以此。</p>
<p>（丙）真元之氣　命門中之元氣是也。命門在兩腎之中。為督脈之主穴，性命之根源。人得此氣以有生，氣盡則死。運氣之工，即以此為基礎，而以丹田為作用之處。心火入腎水，合命門真氣，下注胞中，胞中氣滿，則腰腹熱而任督兩脈自開。然後可以上逹泥丸，（即腦府）下通踴泉。（在中底心）運氣工夫，至此始告厥成。然此氣之所以能走皮毛，逹四肢，無微不至者，全賴三焦湊理之功。湊理即肥肉內瘦肉外之膜綱，與三焦同根，實即一物而異其名，故能一氣相通，暢行無阻也。國衛家之煉氣，大略如是。至煆煉工法，則余所著導引養生衛中音之已誠，不復赘述矣。穆君既退，乃濡筆之，以就正誌於高明。</p>

<h3>證劵多頭稍有結出公債微露跌風</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、經過比較稍有波動、惟亦微乎其微、市面人心恍惚、多空似尚在伺機而動、趨勢目下雖不易展開僵局、但本月份交易已無多日、多空之存賑尚多、斷不能常此相持、陣勢稍有動搖、其波濤恐將立至也、昨日市況、比較上午兩盤跌落較多、蓋因中政會討論華北案件、人心莫測其由、稍起怯疑、四號多頭稍有結出、各幫亦相繼出籠、市面稍起跌風、午後兩盤、因賣戶漸稀、而買戶亦不見跌、交易清閑、又復趨於盤旋、市價結果、微跌五分至四角半不等、成交總額共一千二百三十一萬元、又股票十股、茲將其漲跌結果列比較表如左、（單位元成交單位百元股票單位一股）</p>
<h3>紐約股票後市略回</h3>
<p>新豊洋行報告云、昨（十四日）紐約股市依舊不穩、公用股竟造成一九三二年以來之新低紀錄、末後一因該股之拋賣終止、二因國民釀酒股以公司贏利激增而有力、再以一般預料貨運良好、鐵道股堅定、股市乃復回高、債市因投機性質之鐵路債劵軟弱、致被牽動、美政府公債平定、小交易所股市公用股亦有脫乎、市況參差略跌、芝加哥小麥之潛勢雖堅、終因獲利者了結而跌、全日成交九十六萬股、</p>
<h3>紗花平澹色彩不之標紗</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、大勢情形尚屬平澹、毫無極大起伏、因某公司之多額、關閉不放、故控面尚乾燥、但日商仍在空頭地位、不過現紗銷路尚堪維持、據云蜀中匯水略鬆、深恐該　或有採辦希望、</p>
<p>金鷄小挫二三四角</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因美棉趨跌、塲中人氣渙散、買戶不多、各月均跌二。三。四角、午後聞現紗客銷仍有一千六百馀包、致人心稍振、然新買者依然寥落、且成交殊少、結果各月漲跌一角、全日成交統計祇一萬四千包、查賣出大豊六百包、逹記七百五十包、賡豊五百包、元德四百五十包、仁豊四百包、長豊五百包、元德四百五十包、明德四百五十包、買進均昶三百五十包、吉豊五百五十包、大孚四百包、恒德三百五十包、元一四百包、益昶五百包、德記九百五十包、大昶四百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>棉產二次估計發表</h3>
<p>－較第一次增加－</p>
<p>中華棉業統計會於二十三年十一月十五日下午五時公布二十三年全國棉產第二次估計如下</p>
<p>棉田面積　四四、八○五七九畝　皮棉產額　一一、一七二、五五三擔　廢田面積　四四一、三七○畝</p>
<p>上項估計一係根據河產。山東。山西。河南。陜西。湖北。湖南。江西。安微。江蘇。浙江。等十一省及上海天津兩市之報告編製而成、二以十一月十日以前之棉作狀況為準、三在十一月十日以前各省棉作所受災害之損失、均已計算在內、四棉田以華畝為單位、棉產以擔（每擔一百斤）為單位、</p>
<p>茲將本會本年兩次估計與歷年棉田產額及過去三年每年發表之估計數比較於下。</p>
<p>全國棉田、年有進展、二十二年從三千數百萬畝、進而至四千萬畝、茍社會安定、植棉界又加以不斷的努力、四千四百萬畝之面積、當可逐漸擴充、本年夏季亢旱、幾遍全國、棉株發育、多不健全、北方繼以秋雨連綿、收棉遲及兩旬、降霜又旱、在霜前採收之花、不過半數、霜後收棉、品質不免稍差、採收時期、常多陰雨、長絨棉區、受損尤大、甚可婉惜、長江流域、同一苦旱、目秋後陰雨、或嫌過量、或得雨嫌遲、補益於棉收甚鮮、江西則始終在亢旱中、棉收亦歉、本年全國棉作情形、可謂全受旱災、惟以今年棉田面積、除廢田外、猶比去年增加百分之十、茍天調和、產額當絕不止此數也、茲將此次估計與第一次估計及上年最後修正估計比較如下、</p>
<p>比二十三年第一次估計</p>
<p>棉田　增三六六、五三二畝　增○。八二％　皮棉　增六七四、六二九擔　增六。四○％</p>
<p>比二十二年最後修正估計</p>
<p>棉田　增四、三五三、五五六畝　增一○。七四％　皮棉　增一、三九八、三四六擔　增一四。三二％</p>
<p>平均每畝收量為二四。九斤、比第一次估計之二三。五斤增一。四斤、比二十二年之二四。二斤增○。七斤、</p>
<p>此次估計有［廢田］一項、係確為播種、並已出芽生長之棉田、後因特殊情形、或受水淹沒、或亢旱枯萎、完全廢去、毫無收穫之棉田、</p>
<h3>美棉疲落十磅音</h3>
<p>昨美棉缺乏買戶、多頭了結及南方賣出、市況平疲、計現貨跌十磅音、期貨跌七至十磅音、英棉期貨跌四點、印棉停市、原電錄左（十四日電）</p>
<h3>糧食粉市疲軟之由來</h3>
<p>－洋麥報小…多頭脫手…北銷減少－</p>
<p>粉市、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平軟之象、以洋參報價、芝加哥與均拿大兩處、回落角半左右不等、當開價時、本月份因業外多頭、亟於脫手、微見小面、遠期各月份、亦因業外多頭、互有出入、且現洋麥雖無成交、合價仍覺近情、因此回出者頗多、新投機之收買者、亦覺甚暢、致各月份局面、微覺平軟、迨至下午回盤、各月份交易、未呈暢遂、市價亦呈盤旋之勢、而目下之情形、東北傅加稅後、去路當然減少、園內米價雖見步昂、麺粉雖屬食糧之一、但須看實銷如何為轉移也、結果本月份較小七釐半、十二月份小七釐半、一月份小一分二釐半、三月份小五釐、三月份小二釐半、四月份小七釐半云、</p>
<p>麥市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈寂寞盤旋之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、微小一角五分左右、當開價時、人心平穩、出入無幾、各月份因授受觀望、絕小爭競、故市氣平定異常、迨至下午開盤、因粉市亦轉定勢、買氣亦平、各月份開盤、與上午相彷、觀察後步、如洋麥續定、或有小落之勢、否則當看穩固也、結果本月份小一分、十二月一月份不動、二月份好一分、現麥市面、互擯幾日之後、以廠需尚好、較好二分、開山東歸德麥三元九角二分、計開五千包元、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥多頭獲利者大量脫手、市塲吸力尚佳、除此之外、則市部平淡、無甚壓力、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥十一月十三日收盤十一月十四日收盤上落十二月份</p>
<h3>晚稻到稀續升角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）各幫來源略夥、共到四十馀號、（貨共六千馀石）厚粳居多、晚稻誠屬有限、晚稻市況雖去路平平、包胃青島輕辦三百來包、加起角馀二角之砠、厚粳到貨既較為多、更兼本胃亦復有限、因之市態現軟、雖經售方極力扳住、行情無甚上落、後市恐乏美觀、杜洋尖價盤見定、陰元則酒戶續動、再秀尺奇、變元仍無市、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各地來源三十號左右、市上各貨去胃、新粳早薄稻新羊杜尖消胃早市平常、後市稍好、陳白元陰元零拆尚繁、酒戶續動、惟河貨無存、新陳埠客尖略交、市形新粳高貨昂立、中次價疲近角、新羊杜尖新陳埠客尖價形平定、薄稻早稻略形軟色、陳白元陰元仍向上升、</p>

<h3>論用典</h3>
<p>— 江寄萍</p>
<p>文人往往有掉書袋的毛病，喜歡用典。博士買驢書券，三紙不見驢字。一定用了許多代名詞、如什麼［大耳公］之類的字眼，這是何等可笑的事。在討詞內也常是用典的，將詞句雕琢的非常美觀，其實空空洞洞，一點什麼也沒有，如宋詞人姜䕫之詠梅花：</p>
<p>［苔枝棳玉，有翠禽小小，枝上同宿。客裹相逢，籬角黃昏，無言自倚修竹，昭君不慣胡沙遠，但憶江南江北。想佩環月夜歸來，化作此花幽獨。猶記深宮舊事，那人正睡裹飛近蛾綠。莫似春風，不管盈盈，早與安排金屋。還教一片隨波去，又卻怨玉龍哀曲。等恁時再覓幽香，已入小窗橫幅。］</p>
<p>這是姜䕫的一首很有名的詞。如果我們不看題目，真不知他詠的是什麼，這裹面有［翠禽］，［修竹］，［昭君］，［胡沙］，［深宮］，［金屋］，真不知對於梅花有什麼關係。這首詞真是如［七寶樓裹，碎折下來，不成片段。］在這裹我們便可以看出文人有好用典的癖了。</p>
<p>古人好用典的故事很多，現在不妨舉兩個例。鶴玉露載：</p>
<p>［劉禹錫作九日時，欲用糕字，以其不經見，迄不敢用。故宋子京詩云：［劉郎不敢題糕字，虛負詩中一世豪，］然白樂天詩云：［移坐就菊叢，糕酒前羅列‘］則固已用之。劉白倡和之時，不知曾談及此否？］</p>
<p>由此可知古人為詩之限制甚多，往往有許多意見不敢發表，卽因為一字之不經見者，卽不敢用，白樂天之詩所以高出劉禹錫一籌者，卽因此也。</p>
<p>亦有用典而貽笑柄者。宋荘季裕之鷄肋編載：</p>
<p>［王逸少好鵝，曹孟德有梅林救渴之事，而俗子乃呼鵝為右軍，梅為曹公。前人已載尺牘有［湯燖右軍一隻，蜜浸曹公兩瓶。］以為笑談。張元裕云：鄧雍醬有柬招渠曰，今日偶有惠左軍者，已令具麺，幸過此同享。初不識左軍為何物，既食乃鴨也。問其名之所出，在鵝之下，且淮右皆有此語。鄧官至待典荊州，洵武樞之子。俗人以泰山有丈人峯，遂謂妻母為［泰水］，正可與否左軍為對也。］</p>
<p>讀此段筆記時，不禁為之撫案大笑，蓋用典之不當，未有甚於此者也。無論詩詞文章，都是表現自己的意見的，有意見，便有豊富的戚情。在情感濃厚的時候，只須稍有點文學修養的人，便能寫出很動人的文章或詩詞來。蘇東坡說他自己的文章如萬斛泉源，不擇地皆可出，在平地滔滔汨汨，雖一日千里無難，及其與名山曲折，隨物贓形而不可知也，常行於所當行，常止於不可不止。這樣，只是隨但的寫出，一點也不加以勉強，自然有一種風致。若無意見，無情感，只錄古人之典故，只是笨牛而已，絕不會有精彩。再說討詞，之所以能稱為藝術者，卽因其言簡而意永，如舊詩之五言絕句，一共只有二十字，要在這二十字裹表現出各種的情緒，卽是寫景，也得出奇致勝，給人一種很深刻的印象，舉兩個很普通的例：孟浩然的［野曠天低樹，江清月近人。］這兩句寫景的詩，就不是普通句子，他為什么不用［野曠樹高天，江青月照人］呢？這因為那樣寫才親切，才能給人以深刻的印像，一個［近］字與一個［照］字，相差的真是懸殊了，這是用字的藝術，而不是用典。又如李商隱的［夕陽無限好，只是近黃昏］，是凡看過夕陽的，大概都可以閉目而想象之，這是何等現成，何等平凡的事，可是千古以來，就沒有人說過這句話，只有李商隱一個人。這兩句詩已成人人口中傅誦的名句了，其實在字面上看來，只是極普通的，人人都可以作得出的十個字，然而我們卻沒有作出，這便是真正的詩，真正的藝術，不然一手五言絕句僅二十字，有十個典故，可以湊成一百首，何難之有。真正的藝術作品，便是天籟，天籟是很自然的，絕不是東拚西湊用黃故妝飾成的，妝飾成的東西，也絕不是藝術。隨園詩話有數言甚妙：［近見作詩者全仗糟粕。瑣碎零星，如剃僧髪，如拆韈線，句句加註，是將詩當考據作矣。慮吾說之害之也：故續元遺山論詩末一首云：［天涯有客號詅癡，誤把抄書當作詩；抄到鍾嶸詩品日，該他知道性靈時。］可見最古之詩，並不見得用典，毛詩中的國風，那首是用典的？［子惠思我，褰裳涉溱，子不思我，豈無他人！狂童之狂也且！］這是何等的活潑自然，那個是典！又如：［嘒彼小星，維參與昂，肅肅宵征，抱衾與稠，實命不猶！］表現自己悉怨的心情，是何等深刻！因為詩中有這麼一句［嘒彼小星］，後人遂將［小星］當作姨太太的典故了，這真是可笑得很！我們知道愈是古詩，愈是自然的，越到後來，詩的限制也越多。沈約有八病之說，於將詩弄的不成樣子，詩人要想作詩，要想發抒自己的鬰悶，也幾乎不敢下筆。所以詩每走到一個牛掎角裹去的時候，必有一個極大的轉變，由詩變為詞，詞而曲，曲而新詩，這便是一個明顯的例子。一般人不大喜歡詞，原因是詞不大好懂，自然，如果詞都像上面我舉的例，姜䕫的詠梅花，如猜謎一般，當然是不好懂，其實只要是好的，無論是詩詞歌曲，都是極自然的，如辛幼安的：［少年不識愁滋味，愛上層樓，愛上層樓，為賦新詩強說愁，而今識得愁滋味，欲說還休，欲說還休，卻道天涼好個秋。］這是何等明顯。其馀如李清照，陸放翁的詞，都是很自然的。近入見李清照寫過［綠肥紅瘦］，他便來個［紅瘦綠肥］，總而言之，在古人的屁股後而轉，作人家的奴隸而已！袁中郎的文章之所以妙，就因為他能自已籌詞，是從已出，不依榜古人，古人沒有說過的，他偏說：古人說過的，他偏不說。他給張幼子的信云：［世人喜唐，僕則曰唐無詩，世人喜秦漢，僕則曰秦漢無文。世人卑宋黜元，僕則曰詩文在宋元諸大家。昔老子欲死聖人，荘生譏毀孔子，然至今其書不廢。荀卿言性惡，亦得與孟子同傅。何者？見從已出，不依㥬半個古人，所以他頂天立地。今人雖譏訕得，卻是廢他不得。不然糞裹嚼渣，順口接屁，倚勢欺良，如今蘇州投家人一般，記得幾個爛熟故事，便曰博識，用得幾個見成字眼，亦曰騷人，計騙杜工部，囤紥李空同，一個八寸三分帽子，人人戴得，以是言詩，安得而不詩哉？……如今人送富賈則曰俠，送知縣則曰河陽彭澤，此套語也。］套語有何可貴，典故亦套語，有個相同的事，便可以套上，真是一個八寸三分的帽子。最後我有一句話：假帽戴在頭上絕不會是藝術的！</p>
<h3>浦荘通信</h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>浦荘，是一個小小的鄉村風度的小鎮。</p>
<p>鎮上跟城市的交往，有兩班開往蘇州的小輪船：每天有十多封郵信來往，幾份蘇州的日報小報，上海報紙僅有裁定了來的一份申報，如果汽船一停班，那麼鎮上跟外界的消息也全斷了。</p>
<p>小鎮上開設一些小店的，只有一條街，還是窄狹得不成話的半面街，走到下堂街去，那完全是田野了。</p>
<p>狹的街，石子高高低低地，你穿著皮鞋來走一趟，說不定要在街心裹蹶一交。那些小店，全是一開間門面，像樣一點見的，只有二三個舖子。</p>
<p>窄狹的石子街，七零八落的煙　的小舖子，配在一起，像這裹的日子始終是陰暗的延續，從沒陽光照到過的。</p>
<p>實在這是不成其成鎮的，你不消化一刻鐘，把那些街全走遍了。</p>
<p>夜上，沒有街市，也沒有電燈，幾隻古式火油路燈，也壞去了幾盞；黃昏上，要不是鎮上去熱街的人，那是難走的；腳底下石子街一高一低的，過了一段街，靠邊又沿著河，黑暗裹摸索著，偶一不留意，就掉到河邊上去了。</p>
<p>我初來這裹，黃昏上沒熟人一起走，不敢上街，那麼漆黑中摸索，要命啦！</p>
<p>昨天黃昏上，跟這裹的鄉長小學校長幾個見來第一次消受小鎮上的小茶館風味了，茶館前架著一個火柴棚子，在窪隆不平的泥土上設著幾張方榷子，長櫈；茶客寥寥幾人，榷上張著一隻煤油燈，煙頭似的黃燈光裹，一些扁扁的臉見帽動著，異鄉的寂寞況味，像煙頭的黃燈光似的，捒上我的心尖了。</p>
<p>鎮上居民的風氣，樸實不愛修飾，和氣可親，愛抽煙，懶遲遑的走在街上，那風度是後落穨傷的。</p>
<p>這裹的土產，有煤酒，蒪菜著名，關於蒪菜歷史上有棲逸事，普張翰（季鷹）為大司馬東曹椽，因見秋風起，思吳中菰菜　　鱸魚膾，他嘆息地說：－人生貴適志，何能鷹官數千里，以要名爵乎？</p>
<p>就命駕歸去了，（詳見晉書）</p>
<p>據說鎮上每天原有早晨下午兩集，近村農民來趕市做買賣，近兩年來，已沒有往日的盛況。樹市就跟著一同地術條冷落下來了。</p>
<h3>過琳琪拉瑪的時候（下）</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>到琳琪拉瑪，車夫便停下來裝汽油，渴冰水，和暫做休息。而我們一下車，和和他的肥胖的弟弟亮剛在他們的屋前，一看見我們，便跑上前來了。</p>
<p>我們握著手。</p>
<p>［自從跟著爸爸從味拉搬來這里之後，我們便沒有書讀了。］當我向他們兄弟倆詢問別後的情形的時候，十七歲的和便異常哀痛地說。</p>
<p>少他一歲的弟弟，在肥胖的從來很少煩惱的面容上，現在了欲哭的樣子。</p>
<p>［爸是：沒有工做，－－土人都沒有錢打金子裝飾物了！－－教我們舉著打金子，幫帶家裹的忙。他說：［讀書有什麼用呢？我不是不認識字麼？我不是也會賺過大錢麼？如果不碰到這種烏世界，還怕沒有飯吃？只是現在沒工做，顧肚子要緊，爸的話是對的，但是我們沒有書讀，怎麼可以呢？我們不是還屬小孩子，我們不是什麼都不曉得麼？］</p>
<p>聽著他的繼續的訴說，我暫時沒有話說。在我的小孩子們之中，除祥之外，我最愛的便是他們兩個了。這原因是哥哥異常聰明，雖然年紀小，卻是對這世界有個初步的認識；而弟弟雖然愚鈍，卻是在孩子們中最用功的一個。</p>
<p>［和，情形既然這樣，］我沈吟一下之後，對這好學的孩子說：［你們暫時不入學校也沒有什麼大妨害，便是將來完全沒有再入𣸈的機會了，那也不要緊。因為這世界，學校是辦給有錢人讀的；貧窮的人，既然要靠自己的手掙飯吃，也要靠著自己的力量掙書讀。並且，學校裹的書未必對於一個人有益呢！你不記得我會對你們講過的故事裹的人物麼？不記得你們離校的時候我同你們說過的一番話麼？］</p>
<p>這孩子點首。我們都記得，他們離校的時候，是曾向我哭過的。而我，卻秘搬出一番道理來安慰他們和勉勵他們。而現在，一見面，這番話又被搬出來了。</p>
<p>［那麼，拿給你們的書，都讀過麼？］我又問著他們。</p>
<p>［都讀過了，可是有很多地方不懂，這裹又沒有人可以問得，真可憐呢！－－這想再同先生借些書來讀呢！］</p>
<p>［好，待我回歸Ｋ地之後，託人攜來吧！］</p>
<p>這時車夫卻來催促我們起行了，我們只得中止談話。</p>
<p>［不要記記寫信給我。把你們要說的話都寫在信裹吧。今天是談得很不夠，很不夠。］上車的時候，我說。</p>
<p>［好。祝先生好！同學們都好！］他們從車邊退去了。用著眼睛送著汽車走著的我們。</p>
<p>從橡皮園裹［華僑小學］的白布上所得來的一團高興，一時像被一盆冷水從頭上澆下般，頓時變成了失望。一想起世界上喜歡讀書的窮小孩來，便不能不在這班有生活實感的小孩子們的腦子上鼓起對這世界的詛咒，和從苦學中希望舊時代的破滅。</p>
<p>回Ｋ地後，這二個小孩的信果然時時寄來。直至現在，遠在異國的蕭著琳琪拉瑪的郵章的信，還有時會給擺在桌前。一想到自己現在是從屢次的碰壁中靠著一點小文章來幫助讀書的費用，對於車過琳琪拉瑪的時候，這二個小孩子所留給我的印象，便時時人我的腦中重再湧現出來。（完）</p>

<p>毡帽的垂沿低低遮住他底臉。</p>
<p>［聽見過嗎？嗨！］</p>
<p>手猛然在桌上一叩，從昏暗的燈光下抬起頭。這時誰都看出他是一個滑稽不過的傢伙。小二已送上酒菜，兩個人忙手忙腳　好。他逅乎獲裹的在小二肩上拍著：</p>
<p>［喂，老相好，像真個大牢裹敗兒］（獲中忌呼犯人，通稱啟見）榑，你。哈哈……］他大笑著坐下去。將滿滿一杯酒灌進肚裹，嘖嘖響著嘴唇，連聲呌道：［好！好！］</p>
<p>像是等不及的，又是一杯下肚子。</p>
<p>［今日有酒今日醉。］小二慢吞吞的說。將杯子舉至鼻尖，然後謹慎的㧹下幾滴，不多也不少。［講點良心罷……有蹊蹺嗚，老容：車站？］</p>
<p>［車站，不錯，直有……一個鄨，六條腿！］（這裹約為罵小二商。）</p>
<p>他放出很經的樣子，小二懵糊住了。突然捉住［香莩］的脇窩遙撼起來，老年人弄得人仰首翻，禁不喲唷喲唷嚷著。隨後兩人繼以大笑，大街上都聽見了的。</p>
<p>［香莩］並不因年老而漸生出薔吝，實則，他的酒的二分之一往往被小二喝掉，也許是由於解悶罷，他反而顯得高興。也知道自己做著甚麼營業，卻像所有紅過一時妓女，由於命運的可悲，堅持不在嘮叨著［良心。］</p>

<p>電信特刊周年紀念耑號</p>
<h3>前奏</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>本刋自與社會人士相見，至今適屆一稔。值茲周年之期，承同文不棄，珠玉粉投，因亟彙編，成一專號；惟發印之前，有不能已於言者，蓋同人力薄，而本刋談電信，取材方面，不無枯澀，欲得閱者同情，副社會期望，並能按時出刋，絕未愆期，其間亦頗費若干心血也。</p>
<p>電信界素鮮刋物，有之亦惟供電信界人士之閱讀，與外界可謂絕少關係；故電信界之情形，電信界知之，外界不知也。電信為便利民衆通信之事業，關係於人羣者甚重，若民衆不知利用電信，甚至不知電信為何物，（偏僻以及內地大概難免有此種情形）則民衆自民衆，電信自電，不特電信無從充分表現其效能，且前途亦將永無發展之希望。本社同人，旺衡現狀，以為欲謀事業之進步，不能不藉刋物之流傅，以灌輸常識，溝通意見；一方面俾外界明瞭電信界之實在情形，另一方面則企求各界之批評及意見，俾供交通當局之採納與改良。本刋發行之本旨，卽基於此。</p>
<p>編輯方面，一年來所甚注意者，約有數點：第一，屬於交部電信上之各種建設，及釐訂之新章，為別種報紙所未登，或登而記載不詳，內容不實者，本刋必盡情發表，為社會告。第二，屬於民衆通信，如何能節省金錢？如何有傅遞迅捷？本刋率廣徵博引，務求詳盡。第三，屬於改善電信意見，本刋亦經屢次刋登。至於讀者關於電信上之質疑，亦往往由本刋一一為之解答，此皆對於公衆通信，深有便利者也。</p>
<p>電信學術，採稿頗難，深奧卽欠通俗，膚淺則又習知。介紹歐美新的技術，應用淺近文字，作深含興味的說明，合斯條件，自為本刋所甚歡迎。</p>
<p>社會人士，讀本刋者屢矣，雖尚能博得一般之同情，但本社同人，決不遽引為自滿。至有疑本刋，為交部作過度之宣傅者，斯亦不可以不辯，蓋有事實而後有記載，年來交部對於電信事業之革新，如電報減價，郵電合設，擴充國際電路，增設長途電話擴張公司電話，種種設施，彰彰在人耳目，本刋為電信界刋物，茍有消息確屬便利民衆通信者，自當樂予登載，加以批評，否則毫無實際之宣傅，更何價值之有。</p>
<p>抑有言者：社會進步之國家，利用電信，與年俱進，因電信需要之切，故討論每不厭周詳。為求我國電信事業之發展，博採衆見，允為當務之急，本刋既屬公開性質，敢於週年之期，再作一度之聲明，敬以誠意，期外界人士予電信業務以盡量之批評。</p>
<h3>一年來我國電政之檢討</h3>
<p>— 馭周</p>
<p>本刋問世，已經一個整年，這一年當中，我國電政設施，大都經本刋陸續公佈；不過在一週年的今日，我們應該作一個總檢討：究竟一年中，我國電政當局，做了些什麼，我國的電政，有了什麼進步。</p>
<p>這一年中，電政設施，著實的不少，從這許許多多的設施，我覺得可以提出三個原則，那就是組織科學化，建設合理化，業務商業化，現在讓我們分別的考察一下。</p>
<p>一組織方面　過去電政組織的不健全，是不容否認，有的地方，疊牀架屋，有的地方，畸重畸輕，舉一個例子來說吧，各省有一個電政管理局，顧名思義，這個管理局，就應該管理全工我的電政，然而事實上，既不能管理全區的電話，就是電報方面，亦祇限於有綫電，並且他的職權，實在談不到管理，僅僅是交通部和各局問的一個承轉機關，於是這樣的電政管理局，對於全區電政，積極方面，並不能通盤籌劃，負責改進，消極方面，多了一個承轉，徒然的減少行政效率。這一年中，電政當局，有意把電政組織改善了。第一點是有綫電報局與無綫電臺的合併，現在巴經實行的，有上海，南京，漢口，北平，天津，五處，其他各處，電臺須受當地電局的指揮，也算得是初步的合併。第二點是電報局與電話局的合併，已經實行的有蘇州一處，而最近成立的榆次電話局，就附設在電服局內，將來仍有其他的報話局，照這樣的繼續合併。而尤其值得贊美的，是第三點，交通部在本年六月間，頒佈一個電政管理局章程，這個章程，規定管理局的職權，是管理全區的有綫電報無綫電報市的電話長途電話各種電信事業。是以將來的情形，電政組織上，一共三層，最高是交通部，中間是各區電政管理局，下面是各咱直接營業機關，組織嚴密，層次井然，行政上定可收到指臂之效；並且因為局臺合併報話合併的關係，在在可使各種不同電信事業，互相為用，表現出電信上最大的功效，不致再像從前，互相傾軋，使整個電政陷於混亂予盾的狀態，這可算是組織的科學化。</p>
<p>二建設方面　我國電信設備，和歐美比較，仍然是落後，建設自係必要：但是在電欵支絀到十二萬分的今日，一點建設費用，都是東挪西借，合理的建設，尤其是必要。所謂合理，就是合乎經濟學的原則，用最小的消費，獲得最大的效果。這一年中，我們可以看到，電信建設，在國際方面，著重無綫電報。在國內方面，邊疆也是著重無綫電報，內地則著重長途電話，這就是合理化的表現。國際電信的建設，在我國現狀之下，祇有發展無綫電報，這一年中最大的事，是關放中英中日兩電路，根據統計，我國國際報務，從全體看，日本佔第一，單從歐洲看，英國佔第一，所以中日中英直逹無綫電路的開放，在我國國際通信主權上意義很為重大。再國內電信的建設，我國向來是有綫電報和無綫電報，分道揚鑣，這種雙重的建設，實在不經濟，現在邊疆一帶，盡力的發展無綫電，一年中成立邊疆電臺，計有歸化，張家口，康定，甘孜，巴安，拉薩等處，而歸化和張家口的電臺，就是從洛陽威海衛遷移去的，還有最近就可成立的寗夏電臺，是由沙市遷移去的，一轉移間，而電臺的功用，就相差不可以道里計了。內地除了幾個大都市，如上海，南京，北平，天津，漢口，青島，煙臺，等處的有綫電報，改裝克里特機和自動印字機外，全部精力，集中在長途電話，現在已經完成的，有江西的牯潯南撫城綫，江蘇的錫通綫及揚鎮間的水綫；正在進行的，有江西全省長途電話綱，和九少長途電話斡綫，都是規模宏大的建設。還有一件事，很值得注意的，是這一年中，全國各電報局改成報話營業處或報話代辦處的，憶有一百多處，這是在報務簡單的處所利用電慶做傅遞電報的工具。本來長途電話，是通信的利器，他兼有市內電話和電報的兩種功效，在歐美各國，已有長途電話代替電報的趨勢，我國將來也是免不了的。</p>
<p>三業務方面　電信須商業化，這是毫無疑義的，並且我國電政當局，久已向這個目標做去，不過這一年中，來得更外有成績。我們就拿電報講，我國電報，所以不能發逹的，不外三個原因，就是一。電報價目較高，二。人民沒有利用電報的習慣，三。利用電報的不方便。這一年中，電政當局，對於這三個根本問題，異常注意。第一層，交通部規定一種收報人姓名住址的計費辦法，凡是收報地名及收報人姓名住址，不逾十五字的，概作五字計費，這可使發報人普遍的享受廉價的利益，此外還有郵轉電報和鐵路電報的外加費用，一概取銷，也算是電報減價的一種了。第二層，交通部原有交際電報一種，現在更把這種電報，擴充範圍，可以適用郵轉辦法，並且減低價目，無論本省外省，華文概以每字二分計費，這可以引導民衆，漸漸的養成利用電報的習慣。第三層，交通部於這一年極力的進行郵電合設，將來凡是可以寄信的地方，都可以發電報，另外擴充旅行社代收電報辦法，規定記賑發電的辦法，改善各局臺收發員的態度等等，都是給收發報人以不少的便利。總之，這種改進，無非是根據商業化的原則。其他電話方面，業務上也有若干改進，仍然是根據這個原則，不必一一細說了。</p>
<p>在這個年頭，辦理電政，真正不容易，國際方面，有根深蒂固的外國水綫公司，激烈競爭，國內方面，因為政令不統一，什麼私設電臺呀，有辦長途電話中工，層出不窮，在這種內外夾攻的當中，電政本身，感覺到極大的困難。然而環境儘管惡劣，電政仍然有長足的進展，這也算是電政當局努力經營的一點收穫了。</p>
<h3>一年來電政制度之合理化</h3>
<p>— 葆真</p>
<p>各種事業之興替，緊於制度良窳者至鉅。壁之建築，須有精密之設計，完善之圖樣，方能造成美輪美奐之華廈，其理至明。我國電信事業自前清光緒六年（卽西歷一八八一年）創辦津滬間電報綫路以來，已有五十三年之悠久歷史。當時一切組織章規，莫不借箸於客卿，何以至今仍未能嫓美歐西，其故雖非止一端，但電政制度之未能隨時革新，要為進步遲滯之一大原因。蓋當我國創辦電報之時，歐美各國之電政，亦尚在幼稚時代，其後他人突飛猛進，我則織系守故舊。焉得不瞠乎人後。最近一年以來，交通部所轄電報局臺內部之組織系統，及處理報務業務等辦法，經當局努力革新之結果，面目業已丕變。就交部改革電政之整個計劃言，現在雖猶未脫發動時期。但就電政本身言，則全國電政機關在過去一年中所有之種種改進，確已超出以前五十年所遘變動之累積。閱者對此，或有所疑乎，請略舉數事，以申我說：</p>
<p>一，重訂電政司分科職掌　往昔電政司各科向以數字為區別，如第一科，第二科。第三科。第四科。第五科。第六科等，而各科之識掌，劃分又極不清楚，卽以關於電政人員之管理而論，第一科主管電報電話局長主任及無綫電臺工程師。技術員，以及局臺業務員雇員之任免調派。第二科主管電服斡綫支綫工務人員及綫工之任免調派。第三科主管有綫電技術員報務員之任免調派。第四科主管無線電報務員及電話技術員話務員之任免調派。僅電政人員任免調派一項，電司原有六科，竟有四科分別主管之。電話三項。電司職掌如按事業性質分有綫，無綫，電話三科，固無不可。惟當時六科這中，又未規定某科主管有綫電，某科主管無綫電，某科主管電話。換言之，上述分科職掌，無論就縱的方面觀察，或橫的方面觀察，均屬過於散漫，不僅事權不能集中，且因之發生有綫，無綫，電行譯碼各不相謀之弊，釀成派別之見，以致不能共同發展，此乃制度之不良，足以影響事業之進步也。幸交通當　局有見於斯，毅然將電司各科通盤改組，定名為管理，工務，人事，業務，財務，材料等六科，顧名思義，卽可知各科之職掌事項，例如電政人員之任免調派，不論有無綫電報電話之人事，均集中於人事一科，絕無割裂之弊。其他業務，工務，財務，材料等事項，亦莫不皆然　非獨長官指揮監督可得便利，卽科與科之間承辦案牘，因職掌規定簡明　亦絕無彼此推諉卸責之馀地　可見電司各科分科職掌之重行釐訂，確為電政設施合理化最重要之一端，關於電政制度之改良極鉅。蓋電政司在交通部內為主管全國電政事務之總機關。猶之人身之總神經系，如總理經系不健全，其人之思想行動，卽不免有失常軌也。</p>
<p>二，電報局臺合併　有綫電及無綫電傅遞電報，僅於技術方面稍有不同，其功能效率則完全無異。且均係部辦電信事業之一，何必分為電報局及無綫電臺，各自為政，以致發生有綫無綫競爭營業之事。電報局及無綫電臺之理應合併。固無待申述。交通部自本年五月將上海電報局及無綫電臺試行合併後，成績甚佳。爰於十月間又將南京，北不，天津，漢口等處電報局及無綫電臺實行無綫確可收相輔而行之效，關於報務之分配，卽可儘先擇最迅捷之電路拍發或經轉。假定自杭州發往成都一電，從杭州拍至上海，上海拍至漢口均用有綫電，而從漢口至成都則經由無綫電。有無綫電如此聯絡傅遞，電報速率確能增高不少。局臺合併對於報務既有顯著之功能，而於人員開支，則可緊縮節省，故實為電政制度之又一重要改革。</p>
<p>三，郵電合設　郵電合設一案為本年交通部重要設施之一。郵電兩局同為民衆通信機關，歐西各國頗多統一辦理。我國郵電，因沿革關係，從未能合併，至少限度亦應合設一起，以免人民寄信發電，往返奔波。尤其在通商大埠如上海，南京，北平，天津，漢口等處。郵局早已遍設郵政支局，局所逹二三十處之多，而電報局臺所設分收發處僅有二三處，至多亦不遇五六處，以幅員廣大之上海一隅而言，民衆發電深感不便。交通當局有鑒於斯，特於本年四月通電飭令全國郵局與當地電局合設。至上海等四十七處則規定各該處電報局臺暨特準保留之分收發處及郵局郵支局內均應一律普遍交互設置郵政支局及電報收發處。實行以後，全國電報局臺及郵局郵支局內均可同時發電寄信。裨益民衆，殊非淺鮮。</p>
<p>四，添設電報電話營業處及代辦處　商業不甚繁盛之各地，如果設置電報局或無綫電臺，其營業收入往往不敷員工薪給及材料等項之開支。但國營電信事業，絕非專為牟利，對於民衆通信之便利，亦須兼顧。因此交通部為兼籌並顧起見，除將電報綫路終端之各電報支局改組為電報電話營業處外；特於各地分別添設報話營業處或代辦處，俾各該地話之便利。同時此項營業處及代辦處之組織，極為簡單，營業處祇須設營業員一人及綫工一人，人辦處則由商人代辦，經常開支均屬極省，對於電政經濟及民衆通訊確能兼籌並顧。此為合理化之一種制度也。</p>
<p>五，電政會計制度　從前電政機關，究竟有若干資產或債務？及全國電報局臺及電話局全年營業收入與資本支出（包括材料及員工薪給）共有若干？事實上並無正確之數字統計。此則電政會計制度之不良，毋庸諱言。茲聞交通部會計長辦公處對於電政新會計制，現正努力推行。假以相當時日，電政會計當能煥然一新，盡洗曩昔之紊亂現象。蓋新會計制度之推行，確係急需之改革，而亦為一年來電政制度方面之重要設施也。</p>
<p>吾人綜觀一年來上述種種制度之改革，在管理上則集中事權，統一指揮。在業務上則力求推廣及商業化，以期便利民衆，而使吾人感覺中國之電信事業，確已向合理化之坦途孟晉也。</p>
<h3>交通部部轄報話局台實行統收統支之經過及其最近情形</h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>交通部鑒於北政府時代，各省軍閥，擅委局長，截留報話費收入，浮支濫報，弊寶百出，為統制各局欵項，實行收支公開起見，於本年六月間，由電政司與郵政儲金匯業總局簽訂代理收付報話費合同，規定京滬平津等處一等以上電報局暨各電話局及無綫電臺報話費收入，一律委託當地郵政儲匯局代收，按月經費由儲匯局代發。但以各該處局臺收入，多寡不一，若遇旺月，收支尚能平衡，若遇淡月，收支恐難相抵。故於合同內規定，每月收支不能相抵時，其溢支之數，卽作為電政司向儲匯總局透支欵項，透支總額，以國幣十萬元為限，並指定國際報費收入為透支欵項擔保，一律委託儲匯局代收，所有透支本息，應於次月十五日以前照數還清。屆期不能照付時，儲匯局得停止代發次月份經費，此項合同經雙方主管人員簽訂就緒後，卽於七月一日起開始實行。</p>
<p>當合同實行之初，一部份郵務職工，因對於合同內容未曾明瞭，深恐擔保不確，將來透支欵項，無從彌補，勢必影響郵政經濟，一再呈請交部廢止合同。旋經交部當局，詳加解釋，一塲風波，始告平息，其詳細情形當時各報均有記載，茲不赘述。</p>
<p>其實，此項營業為銀行普遍業務之一種，而電司國際報費，因業務進展，收入逐月增加，擔保亦十分可靠，電司開始計劃統收統支辦法時，曾與某某等數家銀行接洽商訂合同，各銀行鑒於局臺每月報話費存欵為數極鉅，不但現金方面，有大宗欵項可資流動，而按月利息匯水等收入，數目亦頗不貲，於承訂。交部當局為輔助郵電合作之進行起見，最後決定歸郵府儲匯總局承訂，此為合同簽訂之經過。茲將七八九十四個月之收支數目（依據儲匯總局帳單），開列於后：</p>
<p>月　別　報話費收入　代付經費　匯　水　透支利息</p>
<p>七月份　四一二九八八。四六元　六三一六九三。五○元　一四三八。五○元　三五六。四八元</p>
<p>八月份　八七○四六七。八三元　六九○五五○。八九元　一二六七。七三元　無</p>
<p>九月份　八七○四六七。八三元　六七七二三二。二二元　一一九四。六四元　二○三。六○元</p>
<p>十月份　七五五八八九。三三元　七五二○九五。六○元　一四七五。八一元　一○四。五八元</p>
<p>共　計　二六五○三八七。四五元　二七五一五七二。二一元　六二七六。六八元　六六四。六六元</p>
<p>每月事均　六六二五九六。八六元　六八七八九三。○五元　一五六六。一七元　一六六。一六元</p>
<p>按照上開數字，七月份收入祇四十馀萬元，支出六十三萬馀元，收支相抵不敷約二十二萬馀元，八月份收入八十七萬馀元，支出六十九萬馀元，收支相抵盈馀約十八萬元。該兩月份收支比較，相差懸殊，其原因由於辦法實行伊始，各項收入，分類計算，極形繁複，記賑稍感困難，故七月份一部分收入未及結清，移入八月份內併計，兩個月平均計算，每月收入約六十四萬元，九月份適值淡月，收入略減；十月份收入比較增加十一萬元，支出方面因有員工進級等特種支出，故亦較七八九三個月支出稍　二萬七千馀元，均經電司在擔保項下（國際報費）如數撥還，而四個月來，郵匯儲金局得增益匯水及利息一千七百馀元，足見此實為郵電合作辦法之一，而又互利者也。</p>
<h3>一年來之電報業務稽查工作</h3>
<p>— 中明</p>
<p>吾國電報事業，創辦迄今，已有五十馀年之歷史，業務狀況至今猶未臻發皇繁榮之域，較之歐美，既遠瞠科其後，衡諸東鄰，亦難望其項背。夷考其因：由於頻年內戰，商業蕭條；官電欠費，電欵支絀；業務廢馳，傅遞稽遲；技術不良，錯誤叢生者半。由於一般民衆智識低落，不知利用電報；經濟力薄弱，不能利用電服；或鑒於電局官僚氣太深，不願利用電報者亦半。惟是近年以來，上述弊害，在本部職權範圍以內，能力所逮者，均經大加改進，氣象為之一新矣。然本部同人並不以此自滿，為欲明瞭公衆對於電局服務之意見與批判，同時欲使電政上一切新的設施與改革宣逹於公衆起見，於是有電報業務稽查員之設立。該項辦法，始於去年六月間，其任務為：</p>
<p>一查詢往來電報有無稽延錯誤情事；</p>
<p>二查詢電局員司收發電報，有無浮收報費情事；</p>
<p>三查詢尋常或加急華文明語來報有無漏譯情事；</p>
<p>四查詢報差有無需索酒資右冒收來報譯費情事；</p>
<p>五採訪公衆對於電局之意見及其他不滿意事項；</p>
<p>六向公衆說明各項電報省費辦法及其章程手續；</p>
<p>七散發各項電報章程，電報價目表，及去報紙等；</p>
<p>八答復公衆向電局查詢事項；</p>
<p>九向收發報人解釋對於電局之誤會；</p>
<p>十招徠營來；</p>
<p>十一密查當地有無非法或私設通信機關。</p>
<p>綜觀上述各點，業務稽查工作在電信業務上確佔重要地位，故本部對於稽查員之人選，極為慎重，必須學識優良，章程嫺熟，並富有品性上之修養者，始予派充。年馀以來，幸賴各局臺稽查員之努力，及公衆之合作，工作結果，略收成效：往昔公衆對於電局之隔閡，賴稽查員之解釋而掃除無馀；各項電政新章及設施，賴稽查員之普遍宣傅藉使公衆明瞭，而知所利用；他如公衆對於電局一切不滿意或建方式事項，賴稽查員之周咨博訪，電局可明悉其情形，藉以為改進業務之借鏡。至稽查員遇有公衆查詢關於電報上一切事項，亦莫不盡力辦理，予公衆以滿意之答復。職是之故，公衆對於電局之印象，更轉良好；對於電報之效用，愈益明瞭，年馀以來，國內國際電報業務得有長足之進展者，雖其道多端，而業務稽查員之宣傅徠，亦足為發展業務之一助也。</p>
<h3>一年來之本刊</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>大凡事業之發展與否？必以該項事業能否為大衆所需要，及能否得大衆之同情為依歸。前者係經濟問題，後者後心理問題，私營事業如是。兩營事業亦如是。我國電信，係國家經營，語其歷史，有五十馀年之久，計其局所，有綫電報，僅一千零五十局，無綫電報，僅四十七壹，電話僅二十一局，邊遠等省電局，更寥若晨星。論其綫路，架空綫僅四十七壹，電話僅二十一局，邊遠等省，九五公里，水底電纜三，三六○，九九公里。以我國人口之衆，面積之廣，而電報次數統計，僅五，八六二，○○○通，列為世界第十位，向不及日本九分之一！無論在國防方面交通方面以及文化方面言之，我國需要需信之發展明矣。</p>
<p>本刋同人有鑒於此，以為我國電信，必為大衆所需要，又必需得大衆之同情，然後始能發展。故於去年今日，發行本刋，附登上海申報。關於電信建設之消息，儘量登載，俾社會明瞭政府施政之方針，關於電信興革之言論，儘量發表，俾政府採納同人之意見，關於電信常識之文字，儘量介紹，俾各界人士得悉電報收發之手續，及電信工程之原理。一年以來，總計本刋文字，關於言論者，得四十八篇，關於常識者得四十篇，關於報告消息者得五十篇，關於海外電信者得二十九篇，雜著十八篇，共二　全國，同時每期加印數千份發寄各局臺，分贈各收發報人，并為便於保存起見，擬將本刋各期文字，分類編成單行本。將數十年祝為［電信之謎］公諸社會，此本刋發行之意也。</p>
<p>本刋既以公開電信為宗旨，現在電信，是否已逹公開之境域？社會人士是否已得相當之同情？此在今日一週年之時，不可不檢討之也。關於前者同人誠不敢以現狀自滿，仍當本其被衷，繼續為國家社會服務，凡電信上之興利除弊，靡不知無不言，言無不盡。關於後者，固須待社會人士之批評與合作，除弊人妄敢推測，然證之一年來本社接到各界來函，計八百三十七件，其中索寄章程者七百十一件，約佔百分之八十四，詢問電報電話情形者六十二件，約占百分之八，索閱本刋者六十四件，約佔百分之八，此區區之數，置於我國人口中。誠乎渺小！但海外如日本，內地如川黔，均與本社通信，不能謂本刋對於社會絕無貢獻，又不能謂社會人士對於電信，仍然漠不關心。試觀王蕓生先生之［廬山遊記］，稱牯嶺電局辦事之認真，陶孟和先生之［今後的行政官吏］一文，亦謂［電報通信比以前增加了多少的方便］，而汪院長之行政報告，盛稱電信整理之成績，由此證明國人對於電信事業，已有相當之同情與認識矣。</p>
<p>我國電信，既為大衆所需要，又得大得大衆之同情，已如上述，倘能勇猛邁進，不難追蹤歐美。本刋同人在國民立塲上言之，均係民衆一分了，在職務關係人言之，均為電信人員一分子，認為我國電信，應一管理科學化，二建設會理化，三營業商業化，四通信大衆化。欲逹到此目的，在於政府與人民之通力合作。同人謹以公正之態度，作忠實之評述，根據上項原則，為本刋之言論方針。際此周所紀念之時，爰將本刋之發行意旨及其一年來之經過情形，就正於國從之前焉。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談謊騙</h3>
<p>— 荊溪</p>
<p>［一部歷史裹，除掉年月日時人名地名以外，其馀所載的史實大半都是謊騙。反之，小說裹的人物地名時日雖然是假想的，但文內的事實卻是真的。］說這話的人我已忘記了他的姓名，但從多方面去考察，覺得他的話說大致沒有說錯，並且說他幾乎接近真理也不為過。</p>
<p>既然一部歷史裹都是謊話，足見人類以虛偽相尚是古已有之的了。不過時光嬗遞到現在，沒有一件事態不向那事態的尖端高速度地發展，單就現在的謊騙二字來說罷，恐怕古人中最善於謊騙的能手見了也得嘆其範圍之大，內容之煩呢。</p>
<p>［君子重義，小人重利。］古人早把社會上的一種好人一種壞人分開的了，但是我們也明白這是一句很靠不住的謊，因為沒有一個稱為君子的人不在賦得詩上頌揚當今皇上的德政，而那時當今皇上未必個個那麼好，這樣說來，謊騙演成一種公開的秘密業已［由來悠久，］而［於今為甚］也不是貿然的了。故而站在馬路上的小瘟三把假派克賣給你說是真的，這是毫不為奇，更何況他們是小人，再講澈底一些，他們的悽苦的生活驅使他們這樣做的。</p>
<p>如此。筆者豈不要被人稱為有提倡［謊騙］之嫌，但我卻又要說不，我覺得在某種場合說一句謊話是不妨，或許竟是有益的。關於這，已經有人感覺到，也有人說出過，不過那說謊騙不妨的是［對人］的，好比孕婦的丈夫已經死掉，她問起時卻道她丈夫身體健好，如此可以保全兩條生命等等。我所覺得的不妨，卻是不願［對人］多說謊話［對已］不妨謊騙一下，也許這種對已的謊騙有許多跟我一樣的人在實行著的，但說來內心不免又發出一陣悽涼之感。</p>
<p>有人說，人生假如缺少了希望，缺少了夢幻，人生將便淡然無味了，但是我說希望和夢幻以外，謊騙也不可少，也許三位原就可以一體的。</p>
<h3>買便宜貨</h3>
<p>— 牛</p>
<p>我本來不大喜歡去買［血本大拍賣］的便宜貨，我抱定這個主張，有兩個理由：一他們既經犧性血本，我還去佔他們的便宜，似乎有些不忍；二便宜貨總沒有比較好的貨物，所以不買。</p>
<p>前天因為家主婆要做被單，說，現在所蓋的被單，已經碎了，今天報紙上，不是載著ＸＸ號大廉價，清水漂的斜紋布一元五碼麼？你吃了飯快些去買，</p>
<p>我因身邊［瘟的］，所以被單儘管去碎，我只當沒有看見，今天被老婆逼著要買，真是［勢難反抗，義不容辭。］吃了中飯，拿了惟一的［袁頭，］搭上電車，便到目的地去購買。</p>
<p>踏進店門，櫃臺上一位先生，對我看了一眼，便問我道；［你要買些什麼東西？］</p>
<p>我便答道，［一元五碼的白斜紋布，］他便假癡假呆的說道，這布已賣完了。</p>
<p>我說這時還是午後一點馀鐘，已經賣完，你們到底賣多少布呢？何時賣起，何時賣完的呢？</p>
<p>他無話可說，便道要好的有。</p>
<p>我道我也知道你們好的有，但我買不起好的，所以到你們店裹來買些便宜貨，現在既經賣完，只得說聲［對不起］告辭走了。乘興而來，不免少興而返，家主婆天然大為失望。</p>
<p>昨天我的朋友胡君，一頭為到我家裹來，我便問道，今天為什麼來得這樣早？］</p>
<p>他連聲說道：［豈有此理！］豈有此理！今天某報上不是登著某某皮貨店狠皮氈九角九分一條麼？今天我約了一個朋友去買，豈知他們說，已經賣完了，我（朋友稱）質問他，現在時候尚早，已經賣完，試問何時來買，可以買得到呢？明明欺人，弄我們白跑了一趟，真是［豈有此理！］說完，還是上氣不接下氣地喘着。</p>
<p>我遇到以上兩種事情，起初也很為不平，後來想想，真是愚騃極了，完全自己不講恕道，試問現在市面這樣地不景氣，不活動，房價如許這高！開銷如此之大！本錢這樣的重！裝琠這樣的富麗！還要貨物上犧牲他們的血本，你想卽使像張宗昌那樣兩打多的小老婆，恐怕賠墊不起，這樣一想，我便也心平氣和了。</p>
<p>但是我替他們打算打算，也殊不值得。真真賣便宜貨的店家，天然也有，但是登出了便宜貨，而沒有便宜貨費。未免有些欺人，過於滑稽，但是此種計劃，到底不會售的，人家抱定了買便宜貨的目標而來，決不會買不到便宜貨而就買貴貨，這是必然的，結果祇有失去了自己的信用，而生意仍未必能激增。</p>
<p>卽如前天我去買便宜貨的那家店舖子，平時我很信用他們的，因為這家的貨物，的確比他家便宜一些，但是從這次上當以後，我就沒進過牠的門口。因此我想像我這樣觀念的人，想必也不少吧。</p>
<p>所以前天看見一家登載的廣告，排印恐有錯誤，祇以本公司貨物標價為憑，很對很對。</p>
<h3>皇后年</h3>
<p>商人的手板心</p>
<h3>東南西北</h3>
<p>— 三多</p>
<p>在南市華商電車公司為工人之湯金城，前日上午九時，赴五馬路上海籌募各省旱災義振會將其連年縮衣節食所得之現洋一百元，悉數捐助該會，請轉放被旱流離災民云。</p>
<p>六十年來未有之大旱，曾轟轟烈烈熱鬧過一時，甚至齊戒拜佛，請出被逐於龍虎山的張天師來登壇作法，果然佛法無邊，好願以償。然而這一點楊枝雨露太不濟事了，各地旱荒，仍是十分嚴重，姑蘇農民就發生了一次說大不大，說小不小的暴動事件。</p>
<p>自然，現在的問題應該繼求雨之後救濟這般到底受了旱災影響的災民了，或者作者讀報太馬虎，到今天才讀到了如上的一則新聞，一百元當然為數甚微，不過比之僅在事前惟恭惟敬做叩頭工作要有意義得多了！</p>
<h3>空虛的心</h3>
<p>— 胡仁木</p>
<p>從醫院中回來，給我帶回來一顆不平靜的心，我總在懸念著：萬一不幸她要罹難，可怎麼好？</p>
<p>偏怨那個看護，不讓我留在院中看守，使得我放不下心。</p>
<p>［明天來看能。］</p>
<p>她跟我這麼說，其實就是驅逐我。</p>
<p>那時，我一邊下著樓梯，一邊也盤算著：</p>
<p>［怎不讓我看守著呢，我是她的男人，難道說還有不方便的地方？］</p>
<p>可是我終於離開醫院了。</p>
<p>人雖然離開醫院，思想可沒有，我只覺得我的全神仍然留在醫院中，仍然看到妻捧腹疼痛坐不穩站不安的情形。</p>
<p>到晚上，更給我添我愁惱，我一面感到屋中格外空虛，一面還掛記著醫院中的妻。一點鐘兩點鐘過去了，三點鐘四點鐘過去了，人家都睡了，只有我不得安眠。偶然聽到門外沉重腳步聲，就會神經質地想：</p>
<p>［莫不是醫院中出了意外事情，派人送信來了？］</p>
<p>一直到破曉時，才免強合上眼睛，但過一會我又起來了。</p>
<p>可是我又發愁，這個上午可怎麼過呢？作些什麼來消磨時間呢？看書罷。不行，往來沒有像這一天心緒不寗的時候。我看書，看著看書頁中，就變成黑糊糊的一片，或是，從書中跳出無數黑頭蒼蠅，再過一會，又是一片白紙。</p>
<p>那麼，再躺一躺，也許我的覺沒有睡足，影響到我的目力，我把身子像扔包裹似地扔到床上，緊緊閉上兩眼。</p>
<p>不行，在閉緊的兩眼中，竟會看見外面明亮的天光，看見街上奔走著的車輛和行人，看見醫院的大門，看見妻捧腹疼痛坐不穩站不安的樣子。……</p>
<p>不行，睡不著，頭中倒如車輪般亂轉起來，驀地，站起身，我把腳步送對街面上。溜馬路罷，這樣，溜溜逛逛，時間會在不知不覺中就過去的。</p>
<p>為什麼內心裹這麼不安定，這麼急呢。</p>
<p>走著路，又想起妻在入院前說的話：</p>
<p>［我怕，我怕不好……］</p>
<p>不到醫院時，惦記著醫院，真到醫院門口時，倒有些躊躇不前了，這就是，當我糊裹糊塗過了上半天，在下半天跑到醫院前的真情。真的，當我走到醫院房門口時，我的腳步像兩枝釘似地釘到地面上，再也不動一動。心裹跳動得非常厲害怕，怕那不幸的遭遇。</p>
<p>終於，抬起腳，我走上樓，看護看見我，告訴我說：</p>
<p>［孩子生下了，你去看罷。大人也很好。］</p>
<p>一顆空虛的心，到這時算是落到實地上妻總算平安地過去了這生產的難關。我放心了。</p>
<h3>叔父</h3>
<p>— 詠輝</p>
<p>是父親在世的日子，那時，我還很小呢；他－叔父來了，臉孔是怪漂亮的，年紀輕得很呢，－大約是二十三歲吧？無論見了誰，都是很有禮貌的。</p>
<p>父親去世後的第三年，他又來了！這一次可大不同呢，他吸上了鴉片，二十六歲的人，可是他卻蒼老得幾乎使人認不得了，身上穿著破舊的衣裳，簡直是一個乞丐的典型了。</p>
<p>見到了母親，他跪了下來，淚珠兒連串的掉下，樣子怪可憐的，他先問過了父親死時的情形，接著，又說明了不能趕回奔喪的理由，請母親原諒他，母親當然是無可非議的。</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>吃過年飯，他坐在椅子發呆；長嘆了一聲，身子懶洋洋的站了起來，走到母親面前：</p>
<p>［只是這口煙，嫂嫂。］</p>
<p>［你吸上了鴉片麼？］母親用驚異的目光望著他。</p>
<p>［是。］</p>
<p>［為什麼學這種壞樣呢？］</p>
<p>［有什麼辦法呢，反悔也來不及了。］</p>
<p>［不可以戒麼？］</p>
<p>［一下戒除是要喪命的，總要慢慢的戒。］</p>
<p>［你現在每天要吸多少錢煙？］</p>
<p>［二元］。</p>
<p>［你吸上了鴉片，關卡上知道不？］</p>
<p>［怎麼不知道，就為了這個！把飯碗失掉了。］</p>
<p>自此以後，叔父就住在我家，一連三年，不但煙沒有戒除，並且學會了賭</p>
<p>是一個嚴寒的冬天，大家還沒有睡，雪在外面飛舞著。門［呀］的一聲明了。</p>
<p>［誰］？母親問。</p>
<p>［我］。聲音是顫抖的。</p>
<p>［建叔麼］？</p>
<p>［是］。</p>
<p>他進來了，身上的皮袍絨褲沒有了！身體抖得利害呢。</p>
<p>［這樣的大雪天把衣服都賭輸了，不怕凍死麼？輕易不出重意的母親，這次竟發怒了。</p>
<p>［下次再不賭了。］每次都是這麼的一句官樣文章搪塞著。</p>
<p>吸鴉片，賭，成了他的生命。</p>
<p>母親現在再不多給他錢了，除掉了每日兩元的鴉片以外。他常常到鄰家說母親的壞話。</p>
<p>最後偷了錢櫃裹的六百塊現洋，金手金鐲，戒指及一片值一千多元的古書逃跑了。</p>
<p>又是整整的三個年頭，叔父在本邑的縣城裹出現了！鴉片照樣的吸著，錢可實在不賭了！他還是住到我們家裏來</p>
<p>兵災，水旱災，掃蕩了整個的農村，我們自己也不能生存的了，一家人弄得四分五裂。叔父也就離開我們家裹，直至現在，已六個年頭了，他的音信，還是石沉大海似的。</p>

<h3>劉得勝在江西（八）</h3>
<p>— 萬國安</p>
<p>（五）老鄉</p>
<p>劉得勝脖頸子上纏了一條紅布後，就是正式的以蹄洲鎮區蘇維埃裹面的一名小紅兵了。</p>
<p>馬蹄洲鎮是在永豊縣城南面，離縣城有二十里路遠近。鎮上有兩百多戶人家，陳毅所率領的三千多紅軍，常常到這永豊縣界遊擊，那麼這個不大不小的馬蹄洲鎮，就作了陳毅的司令部。</p>
<p>中央軍自從收復了永豊縣城後，就積極準備築路建碉向古縣推進。中士班長劉得勝他們的隊伍，是剛由贛東北上饒那方面調過來預備填防的！剛開到永豊城裹不到五天，劉得勝就被派出遊擊，這黑大個一看見大山，兩條旗桿似的長腿就打哆嗦！眼睛冒金星，心裹發迷糊，在半山腰上打了個盹，就呌馬蹄洲鎮上的赤衛隊捉去了。</p>
<p>當紅軍，當綠軍當什麼軍黑大個並不在乎。不過頭幾天總有點顯著不舒服。他媽的！天天閒不著，呌俺學操打仗俺都斡，偏偏又呌俺學什麼主義！他媽的！俺主義多的很，賭牌九。喝辣燒酒，玩娘們這些主義比什麼都高明。黑大個一到晚上，躺在那亂草堆上心裹就這樣。咕唧著。黑大個樣子長的笨，心眼還對付，雖然斡的不大起勁！但是不敢說出來，那一天早上在村子西頭的墳堆裹，用梭鏢戳死了九個當白軍的，就是因為不願意當紅軍而被處死刑，黑大個當時站在旁邊看的很清楚。</p>

<h3>麗琳哈蕙最近的計劃</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>在一二個月以前，不是曾經有過麗琳哈蕙要脫離好萊塢的傅說嗎？但是最近她宣布的新計劃，非但不要立刻回國，並且還要呌她的未婚夫韋萊（willy　fritsch）來和她合演新片呢。這是一個多麼呌人驚喜的消息呵！</p>
<p>韋萊是德國烏發公司的演員，和烏發訂的合同，到明年一月就滿期了。麗琳特地用著橫貫大西洋的電話，勸他在那時候到好萊塢來。</p>
<p>麗琳告訴一個訪員說：［在新片完畢，我請求福斯公司解除了沒有滿期的合同，讓我去的時候，心裹是多麼難過，多麼憂悶，情願放棄應得的利益，下了這個決心，因為想到好萊塢給我的失望，精神上是多麼痛苦，就是損失了鉅額的金錢，也就不算什麼一回事了。］</p>
<p>［但是我要離開此地的消息一經傅出，想不到各處竟會來了許多電報，甚至於有特地派了代表來挽留的，這是我精神上一個很大的安慰，把我工作的勇氣又鼓了起來。現在決定在離開美國以前，至少再演一張片子，藉以答謝一般愛護我的朋友們。</p>
<p>［這次福斯公司給我的新合同，允許我自己選擇劇本，不要我再做我所不喜歡做的戲了。我以為劇本的情節，不一定要曲折多，祇要戲做得好，就是簡單的劇情也能使觀衆們歡迎的。你看［龍翔鳳舞］從開映到現在，我沒有聽到什麼不好的批評，這類戲我愛做而人家也愛年的。］</p>
<p>［我要韋萊到美國來和我合演一部影片，但是他顧慮著他不十分流利的英語，不會受人家的歡迎。我以為觀衆們不會苛求這些小事吧！他的笑容一定會使得美國人著迷的，他們不是愛那希佛萊的笑臉嗎？希佛萊還稱讚韋萊的笑容，比他自己的更動人呢。］</p>
<p>［有人說我和韋萊已經在瑞士結過婚的，這真是笑話。假使人我們真已結了婚，為什麼要否認呢？當我到好萊塢以前，我們雖然曾經談起過婚事，但是我們因為不能常在一起，要隔著大西洋各自做自己的工作，誰能保險我們離雖以後會沒有變化呢？所以我們同意把婚事擱起，等幾年再說。現在我知道他還是同以前一樣，一點沒有變更。我認識了他已有五年了，他老是那麼溫和的，鎮靜的，並且帶著笑容的。］</p>

<h3>評［人生的悲劇］</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>The　Human　Side－國泰－</p>
<p>［人生的悲劇］，是的，這是人生的悲劇。這對於小布爾喬亞的我們，乃是深深的給它感動了的。</p>
<p>這是一部描寫人情世味的作品。我們在許多布爾喬亞文藝作品中，常常感受到這種凄涼而又辛辣的滋味。不久的以前在國泰開映的，高爾斯華綏的［斷腸雲雨］便是好例。關於高爾斯華綏的改良主義，我們固然不能接受，可是他那嚴肅而又幽默的人情世味的作風，卻博得了人們相當的感動。是的，人情世味的東西，對於苦悶著的知識份子之羣，確是非常適合口味的。</p>
<p>在這裹所描寫舞臺劇的導演，劇作者和一般的作家一樣，將他寫成一個羅曼蒂克的放蕩不覊的性格。同時他的良心卻是好的，他雖然和他的夫人分居，可是他對於夫人和孩子卻仍然是十分親切的關懷。這種人常被人們同情他的人格的，雖然他的品行不大好。同樣，他的夫人領著四個孩子同居，為了生活的維持，她和男友因找職業的關係而發生深切的友誼了，甚至於接受男友的請求而允婚嫁。她，劇作者同樣是要給人同情的，而且在她女兒的口中說出：［母親和道登（卽她的男友）祇是極好的朋友，母親並不管他］。此外在丈夫因詐欺取材的罪名而被捕的時候，她在一陣瘋狂的曄笑之後，而對她的新丈夫說：［今天他坐監牢去了，明天我便和你結婚！］如此苦痛的心情，還不夠使人感動嗎？再說罷，就連那個名道登的人，也是應該給人同情的，雖然導演給與了他輕微的譏諷。其馀的四個男女小孩，因著父親的行為不端和母親的改嫁，一切都深深的刺傷了他們純潔的心情，其使人們感動固不待言。差不多在全部的人物中，祇有那一個名愛爾美的女人給與了人們若干程度的憎惡。</p>
<p>可不是麼？這裹對於平凡的人生，確是描寫得相當深刻的。特別是快樂的調子來寫這沉重的悲哀，更見感人之深刻。然而我們並不說便是喜劇，（固然我們經常稱之為悲喜劇的。）我們祇要認定這快樂而詼諧的調子，使我們從歡笑的外形中去體念實質的悲哀。</p>
<p>當然，這一影片是很戲劇性的（dramartic），至少是故事的曲折離奇。在故事結構中，劇作者對於劇情進展的抑楊頓挫，把握得十分周到。再加導演將不十分重要的過塲戲，都是高速度的略過，（假使庸俗的作家一定在舞臺戲公演的塲合太加穿插的。）所留映在銀幕上的，都是描寫人情的部份。在這裹一方面固然說明了劇本的經濟，而導演對於劇的氛圍之把握，也是處理得非常之好的。但是我們總覺得男主人翁之突然被保出獄而去，加利福尼亞大展鴻圖，不免減輕了劇的力量。這一方面是美國劇［快樂的收塲］之老套，另一方面也表示電影製作者的目誇：電影代替了戲劇，在百老匯失敗的人們，都到好萊塢來罷。至於說教的地教男主人公改過目新起來，其力量乃是微乎其微的了。</p>
<h3>評［野人王泰山］</h3>
<p>— 尤競</p>
<p>Adventurs　of　Tarzen－巴黎</p>
<p>這是一部以舊片雜湊的獸片。</p>
<p>關於［野人王泰山］這片子的內容方面的分析，本來可以說明一種製片家的抓取觀衆好奇心理，以及非意識的對原始生活的憧憬。此外更包含些僥倖的致富希望和一種果報式的宿命論的意識。但是這張片子由於前面說的是以陳舊的片子改編而成，所以全片紛亂異常，而不容易給觀衆看到他的中心思想。在畫面上所看到的，是許多片斷的重複，或類似的所謂歷險場面，如人與猛獸的格鬥，人與人間的爭奪，以及和劇中的並不關切到的野獸的出現等。最後，他沒有法子超出庸俗的團圓式的結局，而使泰山和珍寶德結為眷屬，迎合了觀衆的興趣與觀念。</p>
<p>在這樣陳舊的片子上，如此結局，本不足深怪的來詳細指摘，而最近所謂新的可於泰山的片子，還是不能超出這樣的俗套，是可以驚異的。</p>
<p>由於這片子的攝製是在電影技術不及現階段之發逹日時期，所以畫面所顯示出來的，比較［泰山情侶］，與［人猿泰山］等，在一般的技術方面，差得很遠，又因為這是默片，不能如有聲片的能有許多音響效果，足以幫助畫面來刺激觀衆，以及增加畫面的恐怖與力的藝圍。在這兒，充分地證明無聲片的沒落的必然性，無論如何，牠是不能和有聲片爭勝的了。</p>

<h3>相逢恨晚（The　Age　of　Innocence）（五）</h3>
<p>— 李信</p>
<p>梅一踏進花房，就像小孩子看見了母親一樣，將全身投入紐倫的懷內，一面喊著道：哦，紐倫我們趕回來了。我將你和我說的話告訴了母親了！哦！寶貝呀！寶貝呀！母親說，既然這樣，我們就提早結婚好了。紐倫，我們立即結婚吧！］她說的時候，眼淚都快活得直流下來。她繼續著又說道：［我一直到這裹來告訴你這個好消息。我知道在這裹一定可以尋得到你的！！］愛琳聽了梅和紐倫所說的一番話，很溫柔地對著梅道：［我聽了這個消息，快活極了。我的愛，你們快些結婚吧。越快越好！人生寶貴的東西，常常因為因循狐疑而自誤了！！］梅和紐倫的結婚期倏忽已到。他們結婚之後，紐倫一定要到外國去度蜜月。他覺得異國的風光，異國的人物，兩樣的東西，不同的空氣，可以使他忘記過去的一切。於是他們兩就到歐洲去了。他們在意大利。希臘，法蘭西，等國的各地，徜徉了三個月之久！！他以為將來回到美國，他的心腸一定會變換的，一定會伏伏貼貼，毫無野心的了。不想三個之後，他們回到美國來的時候，一切都沒有改變，連他自己都還依然故我。他痛恨著，咒罵著自己，因為他一到紐約的碼頭，他自己的一對眼睛，已經於不知不覺之中，在人叢裹尋找愛琳的影蹤了。可惜她沒有到碼頭上來。到了明天，他和梅跑到明谷老太太的家裹。紐倫裝著隨隨便便的樣子，很不在意似的問著愛琳在什麼地方。明谷老太太道：［她剛才一回兒還在這裹的。我猜她一定到花園裹去散步去了。你去尋尋她去。］紐倫聽了明谷老太太的話。果然到花園裹尋她去了。他遠遠看見她坐在一張橙子上，太陽光曬在她的頭上。他遠遠站著，一時呼吸都透不過來了。他細細注視著她各種各樣可愛的地方。她低垂著的頭髮，她粉妝玉喙的頭頸，她彎彎的蛾眉，她長長的多感覺的玉手……］他不覺喊道：［愛琳……］愛琳立即站了起來喊道：［紐倫！］紐倫就在她旁邊坐了下來，抓住了她的玉手說道；［我總想著，盼望著來見你……］這麼許多日子了……我害怕著，恐怕你已經走了……就是現在我看到了你……我都自己不相信起來……我恐怕還是個夢……但是，這是太真切了………］愛琳徐徐地將雙手縮了回來，呌了一聲：［紐倫，］就默然不作聲了。她的頭向一旁別了過去。他可以看得見她腮上的淚珠漱漱而下。他從來沒有看見她哭過。他連忙安慰著她道：［我的寶貝，你不要哭。我不說話了。但是，哦，愛琳，走近你的身邊，就好像登了天一樣。要我活著，愛琳，我不必曉得你是在旁邊的……我不能偶然地去看看你嗎？那有什麼要緊呢？那不是我們所不能缺少的嗎？］……但是他已經不能常常到她家裹去了。她的案子已經了結了。他要是常常去不會引起外面的猜疑的。但是他們還可以常常秘密的相見！！在明谷老太太家，在圖畫館裹，在博物院裹，他們覲著沒有人的時候，交頭接耳地說幾句話，手摸摸手，使週身如同觸電的一樣，感覺到一種不可思議的心動。等到沒有人注意的時候，就眉目傅情起來。他們自己覺得羞愧。他們自己厭惡自己。但是他們覺得非如此，就難以過日子了。這樣一個月一個月地過去，毫無目標的，黯然神傷的，衷心惴惴的，偷偷摸摸的歲月，比一切都難過。（未完）</p>

<h3>Commander-in-Chief Chiang Issues Order to Strictly Arrest the Murderers in the Shi Case</h3>
<p>And Entrusts Lu Dip-ping to Offer Condolences to the Family on His Behalf</p>
<p>Yu Chi-shih Dispatches Personnel to Hai-ning Yesterday to Reinvestigate</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan Also Issues Order for Strict Arrest</p>
<p>Hangzhou, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, regarding the Shi Liangcai case, telegraphed Lu Dip-ping, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, on the 14th, saying, "To Chairman Lu Dip-ping of Hangzhou, with respect, reports state that Mr. Shi Liangcai was assassinated in Hai-ning and died. If this is true, we must strictly arrest the murderers and be responsible for thoroughly investigating the matter. Please reply in detail. If his family is in Hangzhou, please provide proper and effective protection and offer my condolences on my behalf. It is hoped you will do so." After receiving the telegram, Lu, in addition to having urgently ordered the military and police agencies to investigate and report on the morning of the 15th, also dispatched the Director of Protocol of the Provincial Government at 10:00 a.m. on the 15th to represent the government in offering condolences to the Shi family and expressed his condolences at the Hangzhou branch of the Shen Bao newspaper. Furthermore, after the Zhejiang Provincial Government received a telegram from President Wang of the Executive Yuan, it also telegraphed a report on the situation of compliance on the morning of the 15th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>On the 14th, Lu Dip-ping of Hangzhou telegraphed the entire province, ordering the strict arrest of the murderers in the Shi case, and separately telegraphed the military, political, and police authorities in Nanjing and Shanghai for assistance in the arrest. On the same day, he telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang and President Wang of the Executive Yuan to report the situation. The original telegram briefly stated, "Shi Liangcai, General Manager of the Shen Bao newspaper, was traveling from Hangzhou to Shanghai in his private car at 2:00 p.m. on the 13th when he was suddenly attacked near the old Wengjiabu railway station by six bandits dressed in black and armed with Mauser pistols, who opened fire and killed him. His driver and a university student in the same car, Deng Zuxun, were also killed. At the time, the Air Force school dispatched troops to pursue the bandits, but after killing Shi and the others, the bandits immediately escaped without a trace in a Buick car with a black license plate No. 72. We believe that these bandits dared to wait by the roadside in broad daylight and open fire, killing three people. It is truly outrageous and lawless. In addition to urgently ordering the military and police to pursue them along different routes overnight and telegraphing the military and police agencies in Nanjing and Shanghai for close cooperation in the arrest, we hereby submit this report for your review," etc. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Yiwu station on the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway in Hangzhou, a suspect named Tang Yunsheng was arrested. He has been temporarily detained by the Yiwu County Public Security Bureau. After an interrogation, the provincial authorities were notified and immediately telegraphed Yiwu County to have Zhang Dan, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, escort Tang to Hangzhou at 7:00 a.m. on the 15th for interrogation at the Provincial Public Security Bureau. Tang is about 30 years old. According to his statement, he runs a Hongchangxiang grocery store at No. 1218 Gordon Road in Shanghai and lives at No. 11 Sunjiazhai in Yuyuan Road. On the morning of the 13th, he arrived at the Hangzhou station at 1:00 p.m. by train from Shanghai, intending to go to Yongkang Fangyan to worship Buddha. That afternoon, he crossed the river and took a Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway car to Yongkang at 5:00 p.m. Because he had an old associate in Yiwu County, he got off the train intending to visit him, but unexpectedly, he was arrested. According to Hu, the Chief Inspector of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau, Tang was carrying 95 yuan in banknotes from the Zhongnan Bank and was acting nervously at the time, so he was suspected by the detectives. It is said that the banknotes were withdrawn from the Jincheng Bank, totaling 110 yuan, and 15 yuan had been spent on the way. He has more than 2,000 yuan deposited in the bank and has a wife and two children. He claims that he came to worship Buddha. He also said that he had worked as a chauffeur for many years.

Upon receiving this order, I respectfully assumed office at the Hengzhou military camp on November 14th. Since the Communist bandits occupied southern Jiangxi, our Chairman Chiang has personally supervised the suppression, advancing on all fronts, and we have reached the final stage of success. Unexpectedly, the bandits, knowing that they cannot survive in Jiangxi, abandoned their nests and fled south, turning westward. I, bearing the heavy responsibility of the western route, have followed the established strategy of the General Headquarters, supervising my troops, and strictly suppressing them. Now that I have received a new command, I vow to be more determined to eliminate all bandits and will not stop until all bandits are exterminated. I hope that my superiors and comrades-in-arms will provide guidance, that the people of the whole country will provide assistance, and that our friendly forces will strictly prevent and block them, so as to achieve a pincer effect and complete the final stage of success. I hereby express my sincere feelings for your consideration. Sincerely, He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression for the Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei Provinces.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>General Manager Shi's Funeral Today</h3>
<p>The day after our newspaper's General Manager Mr. Shi's death. The encoffining ceremony was held in his Shanghai residence. Colleagues looked upon Mr. Shi's remains. Full cheeks and elegant eyebrows, broad lips and a square mouth. His spirit was bright, no less than in life. Yet, a wise man has passed away, and there is no way to bring Mr. Shi back from the underworld. How painful it is. The separation of life and death has been lamented since ancient times. Even strangers would feel saddened. How much more so for colleagues who shared joys and sorrows with Mr. Shi, who were like-minded and shared the same path, whose words and gestures were always familiar, and whose spirits resonated with each other. This scene is vividly etched in our minds. How could we be separated by the realms of darkness and light, on divergent paths of yin and yang, so close yet unable to offer a word of comfort? After twenty years of old companionship between host and guest, we can only see him one last time today. Alas.</p>
<p>As the ancients said, "Once the coffin is sealed, all is done." When life reaches this point, why discuss the ways of heaven? Mr. Shi's coffin is about to be sealed. The physical form of this life has reached transformation. What more can be said about posthumous honors? However, Mr. Shi's legacy remains with the people, and will not cease because of his death. Mr. Shi's career will endure, and will not be cut short by his demise. All of this is the result of decades of arduous work, accumulating bit by bit, to achieve what we have today. Thus, his ability to pass on his legacy is not comparable to something that happens by chance. Mr. Shi suffered a tragic death, and his eyes will not close in peace. What can comfort him is the legacy he leaves behind.</p>
<p>There is a saying that "final judgment comes with the coffin lid," meaning that life is full of changes, and unpredictable. A person's loyalty, treachery, truth, falsehood, merits, and demerits are often determined only after death. However, this is not what we say about Mr. Shi. Mr. Shi spoke with loyalty and sincerity, acted with diligence and respect, treated others with sincerity, and dealt with things harmoniously. He was never contrary to the world, nor did he contend with others. In all that he did in his life, he only knew to dedicate himself to serving the journalistic community, as an aid in promoting social progress. With extra strength, he engaged in social welfare and productive construction, benefiting disaster victims and those who were poor and helpless. Mr. Shi was rich in resources, but also able to act bravely for justice, and never tired of doing good. He truly exemplified the saying "rich and generous." Mr. Shi's fame resounded both domestically and internationally for many years. His achievements in the journalistic world were unparalleled, and he was long regarded as the Chinese version of Northcliffe. His enthusiastic support for public welfare and charitable causes was also admired throughout the world. Mr. Shi himself was humble and never boasted about it, but people still attributed it to him. From this, we know that Mr. Shi's achievements and merits have long been established, and there is no need for his colleagues to use flowery words today.</p>
<p>After the news of Mr. Shi's passing spread, condolence telegrams and messages flew in like snowflakes, and colleagues in the Chinese and foreign press wrote articles praising him, their emotions evident in their words. This is something that Mr. Shi's family and colleagues are endlessly grateful for. It is regrettable that Heaven did not grant Mr. Shi more years, so that he could have long served as a model for his colleagues. Fortunately, Mr. Shi's spirit is immortal, and his example will endure forever. We dare not fail to carry on his legacy and continue to work hard. This is the only way we can repay his kindness and support, even in a small way.</p>

<h3>Anglo-American Negotiations for Three and a Half Hours, Discussing the New Situation in Dealing with Japan</h3>
<p>Japan Is Taking a Probing Attitude Again</p>
<p>Considering Proposing Far East Issues</p>
<p>London Anglo-American naval talks have been going on for many days. The result may be the conclusion of a new naval treaty to replace the Washington Naval Treaty. It is said that the new treaty will involve concessions from each country, retaining the 5:5:3 ratio, allowing Japan equality in principle, limiting battleships to 30,000 tons, and allowing Britain to have 70 cruisers. This is what Britain has consistently insisted on in the conference. When revising the categories of various ships, they will try to meet the requirements of each country, i.e., allowing Japan to have more submarines, the United States to have more battleships and aircraft carriers, and Britain to have more cruisers. According to sources from the American representatives, the American naval circles may make some concessions on one of the above. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>London Anglo-American naval representatives met today for three and a half hours. According to sources from the British side, the discussions were all about vague points, or points that were not directly related to Japan. After the meeting, the American representative told reporters that the British representatives asked them to keep the details of the talks strictly confidential. This shows that the talks have now entered a complex stage. The American side feels that there are currently differences of opinion among the British representatives, with some willing to accommodate Japan at any cost, and others standing on the side of the United States. It is said that the American representatives insisted on the 5:5:3 ratio. Both sides mentioned the naval conference next year today, but it is not certain whether it will be held. However, according to responsible British sources, the impression of the American representatives that there are differences of opinion among the British representatives at today's naval talks is not true. Today's meeting did not change the situation regarding the 1935 conference. Hopes for the conference are no less than before. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>London Yesterday's talks between British and American representatives focused on the situation caused by Japan's abrogation of the Washington Treaty. It is said that the British representatives discussed with the American representatives the issue of preparing to conclude the above-mentioned new naval treaty. This issue has been telegraphed by the American representatives to Washington, and they are now quietly awaiting President Roosevelt's instructions. The American side is showing optimism about the new approach proposed by the British representatives yesterday. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>London The Japanese government has consistently opposed the discussion of political issues at the London Naval Conference. However, the British and American governments both believe that Japan's abrogation of the Washington Treaty is related to the political issues in the Far East. As the conference progresses, they intend to propose a new agreement or joint declaration on the China issue. In particular, the American representative Davis has repeatedly mentioned the review of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Four-Power Treaty regarding China, which is noteworthy.

<h3>Hirota Instructs Matsudaira to Inquire About Britain's True Intentions</h3>
<p>Reserving Specific Replies</p>
<p>Tokyo The naval and foreign affairs authorities are carefully discussing the compromise proposal presented by British Prime Minister MacDonald to Japanese representative Matsudaira on the 7th. Foreign Minister Hirota will instruct the two representatives, Matsudaira and Yamamoto, on the 15th. The main points of the telegram are as follows: We express our sincere respect for Britain's attitude in wanting to complete the disarmament conference, but the disarmament policy proposed by the Japanese government is for the sake of completing the grand cause of disarmament, and we demand the principle of equality in armaments. Therefore, there are still some doubts as to whether Britain's true intentions can satisfy the Japanese government's demands. Therefore, we still hope to continue negotiations on this point, etc. The above instruction intends to clearly inquire about Britain's intentions regarding the trial compromise proposal, but it only expresses the Japanese side's attitude. As for whether to approve it, a reply must be reserved, because the British trial program is considered to be only for discussion purposes, and there is no need for the Japanese delegation to give a formal reply, but to be in a free position to inquire about Britain's true intentions. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo After careful study by Foreign Minister Hirota and the naval authorities of the compromise plan proposed by Britain to the Japanese representative last week, it was telegraphed today to the Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira and the Japanese Chief Representative Yamamoto for Naval Talks to continue to inquire of the British government about all the details regarding Britain's willingness to nominally recognize Japan's naval equality based on the gentleman's agreement, and to have each country announce the limits of its naval construction.

<h3>The Situation Has Not Eased, Britain Is Accommodating the United States</h3>
<p>Agreeing to Maintain Standard Tonnage</p>
<p>London This afternoon, the Anglo-American naval delegations met in the House of Commons to discuss general naval issues, with particular emphasis on the two proposals put forward by Britain on the 8th of this month to reconcile the views of the United States and Japan. Today's meeting was convened by the British side last night, and the results of the discussion failed to ease the situation of the talks. However, the nature of the talks was very important. The reason is that the oral proposal put forward by the British government to the Japanese side is tantamount to abandoning the 5:5:3 ratio in principle, which the United States opposes. The Washington dispatch published in the London newspapers has bluntly stated this, and the White House has also made some statements. Today's meeting was to discuss this issue, so almost all members of the British and American delegations attended. Those attending from the British side included Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell, Chief of the Naval Staff Sir Chatfield, Counselor of the Foreign Office, naval problem expert, Craigie, and the Board of Trade expert, Sir Fisher. Those attending from the American side included Norman Davis, Counselor of the Embassy, Chief of the Naval Staff, Stanley, and two experts. The talks lasted for three hours. After the meeting, someone told the press that today's talks discussed the entire Washington Naval Treaty, i.e., the tonnage of warships and the types of ships. The United States and Britain had discussed this matter in August of this year. Today, the American representatives insisted that it is necessary to maintain the 35,000 tons of battleships. Britain hopes to reduce it. According to evening news, the British representatives seemed to have agreed to maintain the standard tonnage stipulated in the Washington Treaty at today's talks. This is a concession from Britain to the United States. However, the price Britain obtained was only that the United States could slightly reduce its resistance to the first point of the compromise proposal recently put forward by Britain. According to reports, the compromise proposal put forward by Britain is currently being studied by the Tokyo government. The first point is to recognize that each signatory country has the right to freely judge its own defense needs, but the different types of ships within each type of ship will be redistributed. This level is actually enough to restrict the naval autonomy of each country, and make it not far from the ratio originally stipulated in the Washington Treaty. However, the principle of recognizing the naval autonomy of each country is precisely what the United States considers very important. The United States has always opposed this point, and has not changed it until now. However, the British oral proposal is not rigid. The reason for putting it forward is that there was a risk of the talks breaking down at that time, so it was used to avoid this, so that the talks could continue. The questions raised by the Tokyo government on the British proposal may change the situation of the talks and lead to a way out. Tokyo's reply can arrive tomorrow. Whether a new treaty can replace the Washington Naval Treaty, so that naval arms race can be avoided, will be known within a few days. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>American Secretary of the Navy Announces the Reconstruction of Pearl Harbor</h3>
<p>Needing US$1.8 Million</p>
<p>Washington Secretary of the Navy Swanson announced today that the Navy will include the cost of renovating Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in the budget for this fiscal year. According to current plans, this renovation work includes excavation and other improvements, totaling US$1.8 million. Swanson also said that after the renovation, the port will be able to accommodate the entire US fleet. Swanson's announcement is very important, because the London talks are now deadlocked, and the State Department has also admitted that the United States has given up hope for the success of international disarmament agreements. Pearl Harbor is one of the four places in the legendary American plan to consolidate its defenses in the Pacific after the failure of the naval treaty. (National News dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>American Air Force Will Be the World's Number One in Three Years</h3>
<p>The Key Is Whether There Is Resistance to the Current Plan</p>
<p>Washington If the US Army Air Corps' plan does not encounter resistance, the United States will have the largest and newest air force in the world in three years. The Army Air Corps submitted a budget today, requesting to purchase 800 new aircraft, of which 500 will be used to replace old and unsuitable aircraft. These 800 aircraft will be built in three years, so that after three years, the United States will have a total of 2,400 combat aircraft, with extremely new equipment and great power. No air force in the world will be able to surpass it. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>Washington The Aeronautics Office has recently drafted a plan to build 800 aircraft, of which 500 will be used to replace old aircraft, and the remaining 300 will need to be added. The number of US military aircraft will thereby increase to 2,400. The Navy also plans to build an airship with a volume of approximately 2.5 million cubic feet for training purposes. If this plan is approved and implemented, the US Air Force will become the most modern and powerful in the world. In addition, the War Department plans to request 20 million yuan to innovate the army and motorize it. The United States has nine special forces groups, specializing in air defense for the United States and its overseas territories. The War Department also plans to request 11 million yuan in funding to provide these special forces with new equipment. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>Washington If the plan currently being considered by the Navy Department becomes a reality, the US Navy's large airship Macon will soon fly to Hawaii. Secretary of the Navy Swanson stated today that this long-distance flight is experimental in nature to determine whether the Navy should build large airships again. It is said that if you want to change the opposing attitudes in some aspects, only the Macon large-scale airship can fully demonstrate its combat power in this test flight. Swanson continued that the flight to Hawaii is developmental in nature and is assisted by the fleet. Swanson also said that the Navy will no longer build aircraft deck cruisers because naval experts believe that their effectiveness is not as good as ordinary cruisers. Swanson also confirmed the Navy Department's plan to build 24 battleships in the next fiscal year's Vinson case and reach the naval force allowed by the treaty by the end of 1942. However, if it is necessary to speed up the progress, the US dockyards can also complete the shipbuilding plan in half the original time. (National News dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>British Secretary of War States Naval Policy</h3>
<p>A Fleet to Protect Maritime Communications</p>
<p>But Hope to Avoid Naval Competition</p>
<p>London When the House of Lords met today, Secretary of War Lord Hailsham detailed the matter of imperial defense, first mentioning the naval talks, saying that the talks are still in progress, so he could not offer practical information. The overall situation of our naval position is now being considered very carefully according to our absolute needs. The government hopes to establish a treaty that avoids naval arms competition, and on the one hand allows us to maintain the necessary fleet to replace the naval treaty that expires in 1936. The government has to consider the issue of quantitative and qualitative disarmament, but maintaining a fleet sufficient to protect our maritime communications is essential. Everyone should not have unnecessary fears about this point. The Secretary of War continued that Britain should maintain an army sufficient for dispatch, and detailed the progress of the expansion of the air force, saying that the government has spent 80,000 pounds to build an air force base in Singapore, and 50,000 pounds to build an air force base in Hong Kong. There is now a team of airships engaged in measuring the aviation routes between Singapore and Hong Kong. The possibility of resisting enemy bombers is now greater than at the end of the European War. The government's policy is to do its best to reduce the danger of being attacked by the enemy in the sky.

<h3>Situation in Central and Southern Europe Is Serious</h3>
<p>Italy and Yugoslavia Are Hostile and Broadcast Propaganda to Each Other</p>
<p>South Hungary Deepens Animosity Due to the Marseilles Case</p>
<p>Belgrade A violent anti-Italian riot occurred in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, on Monday. The tense relations between Italy and Yugoslavia, which have been tense since the European War, have become more serious today. The Yugoslav state-run radio station severely criticized Italy last night and warned that "the Yugoslav government has been very tolerant, but it cannot be endless." The broadcast also stated that there was an Italian merchant ship off the coast of Dalmatia that scattered anti-South leaflets from the deck. An Italian ship also dropped a bottle in the Kožula area, containing a letter to the people of Dalmatia saying "you will soon return to the embrace of Italy." Some Italian radio stations are also broadcasting anti-South propaganda. Italy and Yugoslavia have been eyeing each other for many years for Dalmatia, which occupies about 100 miles of the Adriatic coast, and are actively manufacturing soldiers and training troops on the border in preparation for a war. In 1915, when Italy joined the European War, Britain and France secretly allowed the area to be assigned to Italy. By the time the European War ended, U.S. President Wilson opposed the Italianization of Dalmatia at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated national self-determination, allowing the people of Dalmatia to choose their nationality. As a result, the people of Dalmatia were willing to belong to Yugoslavia, and the dispute has not ended to this day. (National News dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<h3>Germans Send Letter to the League of Nations Denying Coercion</h3>

<p>The League of Nations Secretariat in Saarbrücken published a lengthy report last week accusing the Germans of exerting pressure on the residents of the Saar.

<h3>Shanghai to Levy Land Value Tax</h3>
<p>British Eden Replies to Member of Parliament's Question</p>
<p>Says it is in accordance with the law and reasonable</p>
<p>London, British Minister Weir Aiden explained the status of British citizens regarding Chinese taxation in the House of Commons today. Eden, answering a question from a member of parliament, first stated the legal position, and then said that foreigners who own property in Greater Shanghai have recently received demands to pay land value tax. This tax is not illegal under Chinese law, nor is it discriminatory, and the tax amount is still reasonable. Chinese people all pay it. The British authorities have advised British citizens that if disputes arise from non-payment of this tax, the British authorities cannot guarantee effective assistance. As for business taxes levied in places such as Guangzhou, the regulations are complicated, unrealistic, and the valuation methods are inconsistent and unfair. The implementation is not based on law, but on arbitrary actions by administrators. Therefore, the British merchants' refusal has received the possible full assistance of the British authorities.

The Provincial Government, in accordance with the order, implemented the change of jurisdiction of the three districts on October 21. (15th Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>News of the Sale of the Haiyuan Pavilion Collection</h3>
<p>Jinan, a Tianjin dispatch states that the director of the Central Library went to Tianjin to purchase the Haiyuan Pavilion collection. The owner of the books, Cunhai Society, asked for a minimum price of 400,000 yuan. The books totaled 1,257 volumes, totaling 310 yuan each. If sold to Shandong, the price can be reduced. Shen Hong planned to issue public bonds to purchase the books, but the central government did not approve. The most valuable books are the Song dynasty editions of the Four Classics and Four Histories, but the central government noted that two of the Four Histories were missing. The Four Classics are Mao Shi, Shangshu Ji Chuan, Yili, and Liji. The Mao Shi is not a good edition, and the Liji is a fake edition. Because Haiyuan Pavilion has two kinds of Four Histories, the better ones are still in the hands of the original owner, Yang Jingfu. The part for sale includes 34 Song dynasty editions, 25 Yuan dynasty editions, and 40 annotated editions by famous people. (15th Special Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Visit to Taiyuan</h3>
<p>Attending Welcome Rally From All Circles</p>
<p>Visiting Mingxian School of Tai Valley</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling arrived in Taiyuan by plane a few days ago. The province's party, government, military, agriculture, industry, commerce, education, women from all walks of life, and the New Life Movement Association, Zhejiang Association in Jin and other associations, successively prepared for welcome rallies. Due to Generalissimo Chiang's short schedule, in order to save time, a joint welcome rally for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling was specially held at the Suiyuan Appeasement Headquarters in Dasheng Hall at 10 AM today (the 10th). The arrangement of the meeting place was extremely neat, simple, solemn and magnificent, with the party and national flags and the Premier's portrait hanging in the center, and the New Life emblem hanging below. In front of the lecture stage, many pots of chrysanthemums of various colors were displayed. New Life slogans were posted upstairs and downstairs. The seats on the left were set for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling, Vice President Kong, Chairman Soong, Secretary-General Yang, Director Yan, Chairman Fu, Director Yan, Madame Yan, Chief of Staff Zhao, Chairman Xu, Superintendent Yang, and Generalissimo Chiang's entourage. The seats on the right were set for the officials of the two Suiyuan provincial headquarters, newspaper reporters, senior civil officials, women, and elementary school students in front of the stage on the left. Senior military officials, middle school students and above, and public officials were seated on the right. Around downstairs were seats for members of the party branch, social groups, business community, street chiefs, factory employees, which were set upstairs in order. The arrangement was very neat and orderly. Around nine o'clock, the welcome staff gathered in the designated place and entered the hall one after another, totaling more than 1,500 people. Military and political dignitaries Zhao Daiwen, Xu Yongchang, Fu Zuoyi, Yang Aiyuan, Wang Jingguo, Li Fuying, Sun Chu, Zhou Dai, Feng Pengzhu, Rong Honglu, and various office chiefs entered the seats one after another. Generalissimo Chiang got up at 8:10 this morning, met with Yang Aiyuan, Zhou Dai, Rong Honglu, Sun Chu, Feng Pengzhu, Yang Yaofang, Li Fuying, Wang Jingguo and other eight people, after a brief rest, he, together with his wife Madame Soong Mei-ling, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Secretary-General Yang Yongtai, Director Yan Daogang, advisor Donald, and attendants, took cars in military uniform to the Suiyuan Appeasement Headquarters. After getting off the car, music was played to welcome them. Director Yan Yuanzhen presided over the ceremony and shouted for everyone to stand at attention. Generalissimo Chiang, together with his wife Madame Soong, Minister Kong, and others, took their seats in order. The bell rang ten times, and Director Yan, the chairman, started the meeting. Everyone stood at attention, played music, and then bowed three times to the party and national flags and the Premier's portrait, and bowed once to Minister Kong and the officials present in Jin. After the chairman respectfully read the Premier's will, he gave a welcome speech. After the speech, he asked Generalissimo Chiang to speak. Generalissimo Chiang earnestly explained the essence of the New Life and encouraged everyone to start from themselves. His words were all cautionary. It was not until 11:35 that the speech was completed. Then, Madame Soong Mei-ling was invited to speak. Madame Soong felt a slight cold due to the fatigue of the journey, so Minister of Finance Kong delivered the speech on her behalf and expressed his gratitude. Minister of Finance Kong then gave an earnest speech. Finally, Chairman Soong Zheyuan of Chahar Province and Secretary of the Nanchang Headquarters of Generalissimo Chiang, Yang Yongtai, delivered speeches. At 12:05, Director Yan gave a thank-you speech, and the ceremony was completed. At 12:30 noon, Minister Kong accompanied Generalissimo Chiang in a special car from the Suiyuan Appeasement Headquarters to visit Mingxian School in Tai Valley. Generalissimo Chiang's advisor Donald, Chief Secretary of the Lixing Society Huang, Attendant Xuan Tiewu, and many attendants of Minister Kong all followed. In addition to sending Section Chief of the Public Relations Office Song Zihui to take care of them, the two Suiyuan provincial headquarters specially ordered Yang Aiyuan, Qingxiang Superintendent, Zhao Chengzhou, Cavalry Commander, Li Fuying, Commander of the Sixtieth Division, Wang Jingguo, Commander of the Seventieth Division, Yang Yaofang, Commander of the Seventy-First Division, and Chairman Xu specially ordered Wang Ping, Director of the Finance Office, Wang Qian, Secretary-General, and Gao Huai, Director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau, to go to receive them. Along the way, the garrisons of Taiyuan, Yuci, and Taigu counties provided security, and Commander of the Military Police Li Runfa and Brigade Commander of the Guard Brigade Du Chunyi took cars in the lead to provide security. Colorful arches were built at both Yuci Station and Taigu Station, and slogans were posted everywhere. The military and police were strictly guarded. The Yuci County Magistrate led the county's subordinates and representatives of various agencies and groups, as well as all the students of the men and women senior and junior schools, more than 1,000 people, waiting at the station to welcome them. At Taigu Station, Kong's family members and the county magistrate Li Tengjiao led Kong's family members and the faculty and students of Mingxian School and all the men and women senior and junior schools in the city and representatives from all walks of life in the county, about 7,000 people, waiting at the station to welcome them, extending more than one li. When Generalissimo Chiang and his wife arrived at the two stations, they got out of the car and walked, smiling and frequently nodding to the welcomers to express their gratitude, and Minister Kong introduced them separately. At 2:10, the car arrived at Kong's residence. After a short rest, Minister Kong hosted a banquet. During the banquet, after Minister Kong's earnest request, it was decided to stay in Taigu tonight. In addition to telegraphing Secretary-General Yang Yongtai and Attendant Yan Daogang, he also telegraphed Chairman Song Zheyuan of Chahar, Chairman Fu Zuoyi of Suiyuan, and Chairman Xu Yongchang of Jin Province to meet. After the banquet, Minister Kong guided them to visit Kong's residence and garden. At 5 PM, they arrived at Mingxian Middle School. The school and students from all levels of schools in the city welcomed them to the school gate and set off firecrackers to pay tribute. The students from all schools were neatly dressed and orderly. Especially the students of Mingxian were full of vitality, and the boy scouts were even more robust. Generalissimo Chiang and his wife and attendants were personally received by Minister Kong at the school auditorium for refreshments. Then, they ascended the lecture stage built on the school playground and gave a speech in response to the welcome meeting. Minister Kong presided over the meeting and first gave an opening speech, and then invited Generalissimo Chiang to speak. Afterwards, Minister Kong delivered a thank-you speech and took photos on the playground. After that, Minister Kong led them to visit Mingxian School and the school's villa, and to pay respects to Minister Kong's ancestors. Minister Kong thanked them. At around 6 PM, they returned to the old residence. At that time, Chairman Fu Zuoyi of Suiyuan had already arrived and followed to visit. Chairman Xu Yongchang of Jin Province and Chairman Song Zheyuan of Chahar also arrived one after another around 5 PM. Generalissimo Chiang instructed earnestly for more than half an hour, saying that he was very moved to see the vitality of the Mingxian students. The word Mingxian may have other interpretations, but thinking about it, it is also very appropriate to interpret it as engraving in the heart and aspiring to be sages and heroes. He hoped that all teachers and students of the school would use the spirit of "renewing themselves daily, renewing themselves every day, and renewing themselves again every day," and follow the New Life implementation methods to strive for the path of sages and heroes. The general meaning of Minister Kong's speech was that Generalissimo Chiang and his wife were very concerned about Mingxian School, and they felt especially honored to come to the school to give a speech this time. He hoped that all faculty and students would remember the speech of Generalissimo Chiang and his wife in their hearts, earnestly adhere to it, and follow it to serve the country and society on the right path of sages and heroes, and not go astray and harm the country and society. It is heard that Chiang is scheduled to return to the province from Gu in the early morning tomorrow and plans to take off for Nanchang at 12:00 noon. (10th)</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Beiping</h3>
<p>Sorting out North China's Finances</p>
<p>Inspecting the Haihe River Project</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, due to Generalissimo Chiang's visit to Taiyuan for inspection, specially flew from Beijing to Taiyuan to greet him. After Chiang left Taiyuan and returned to Jiangxi, Kong took a Ford plane to Beijing on the previous (11th) after Chiang took off by a Junkers airplane from Taiyuan. Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling and adviser Donald and his wife also took the same plane to Beijing, as they intended to visit Beijing. Kong's mission to Beijing has two purposes: one is to inspect the current financial situation in North China after the abolishment of excessive taxes, and the other is to inspect the Haihe River project. Therefore, after arriving in Beijing, he immediately met with Lu Mutin, Director of the Finance Office of Hebei Province, Ning Encheng, Director of the Unified Tax Bureau of the four provinces of Jin, Hebei, Chahar and Sui, Ding Chungao, Director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau of Hebei Province, Zhang Yongnian, Director of the Management Office in Beijing of the branch offices along the Changcheng Line of the Tianjin Customs District, and Cheng Yuanfan, Director of the Finance Bureau of Beiping City, and inquired in detail. Chairman Song Zheyuan of Chahar Province and Chairman Yu Xuezhong of Hebei Province also arrived in Beijing successively from Taiyuan and Tianjin on the previous (12th), and met with Kong that night to conduct thorough discussions on the financial issues of their respective provinces, and the results were satisfactory. As Kong himself is also responsible for governing the national water conservancy undertakings, it is necessary to effectively sort out the Haihe River project, which is the most important in North China. Therefore, Kong did not stay in Beijing for a long time and took the special car used by Soong Mei-ling at 2:25 PM today (13th) and left Beijing for Tianjin. Soong also went to Tianjin in the same car as there were matters to be dealt with in Beijing. Adviser Donald and his wife, as well as Chiang and Kong's attendants and guards, all followed. The Ford plane that Kong and Soong took also took off from Nanyuan at 2:10 PM this afternoon (13th) and landed in Tianjin to await orders. Ning Encheng, Director of the Unified Tax Bureau of Jin, Hebei, Chahar and Sui, and a total of four Kong's attendants took the plane to Tianjin to handle official business. Kong and Soong are scheduled to stay in Tianjin for one day. Kong immediately ordered to take the Ford plane to inspect the Haihe River project. The water conservancy personnel of Hebei Province all arrived in Tianjin on the previous (12th) to prepare for inquiries. During Kong's stay in Beiping, he told the visiting reporters that "Tianjin has failed to achieve full success in recent years due to the impact of the Haihe River. If no urgent measures are taken, the Tianjin Commercial Port will become a waste. I (Kong self-proclaimed) am also responsible for all water conservancy matters, so I plan to take advantage of the trip to North China to inspect finances and take a look. There is already a draft of an effective plan for dredging the Haihe River. After the inspection, I will make overall plans to ensure that the water is used to its advantage and the port is used to its advantage. Regarding the issue of river management, I (Kong self-proclaimed) am also prepared to meet with the主管 officials to inquire about everything in order to plan governance measures." As for the financial issues of the provinces in North China, Kong discussed with Song Zheyuan and Yu Xuezhong and generally decided that after the order to abolish excessive taxes is fully implemented, the central government will discretionarily provide subsidies to those whose local finances are insufficient. For example, in Chahar Province, in addition to the tobacco and alcohol license tax and stamp tax revenue to offset the abolishment of excessive taxes, the 협餉 (monthly 150,000 yuan) paid by the province to the military branch will be paid by the Ministry of Finance in the future. The monthly burden on Chahar Province will be reduced by this amount, and the revenue and expenditure can offset each other. However, it is still necessary to make considerable contractions from the expenditure side to avoid losses. As for the finances of Hebei Province, because the environment in the past five years has been different, its difficulties are very different from other provinces. Up to now, the expenditure situation of the province is like a rolling and reusing method. Taking the past year as an example, the supply of the Great Wall War and the loss of the Yellow River breach have created huge wounds and scars that cannot be relieved, not to mention making up for them. During Kong's visit to Beijing this time, Yu Xuezhong went to meet him for detailed discussions, and a solution has been found. However, for the detailed measures, Kong has ordered Ding Chungao, Director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau of Hebei Province, to consult with the relevant agencies. Ding also went to Tianjin with Kong yesterday (13th). The reporter met with Ding at the station and was told that the financial difficulties of Hebei Province are indeed a fact. The previous maintenance was a method in the absence of a solution. Rolling and reusing is a temporary solution, but it is not a long-term plan. When Hebei Province held an administrative meeting, I was one of the hired experts. During the meeting, the proposal jointly drafted by me and other three financial experts and the Hebei Province's budget for this year approved by the Hebei Finance Department failed to pass due to many difficult problems. The so-called difficulties are generally divided into two major items: one is the offset after the abolishment of excessive taxes, which is too far from the number of expenditures, and the other is the liquidation of past rolling and reusing accumulated losses. Regarding the former, the central government can discretionarily remedy it, and regarding the latter, Minister Kong is still considering it. I am going to Tianjin to gather relevant personnel to discuss specific measures to ensure that Hebei Province's budget for this year is determined as soon as possible. According to my observation, after Minister Kong and Chairman Yu discussed the problem, most of the difficulties have been resolved, so it can be completely resolved after another round of detailed discussions. The above-mentioned aspects are the main tasks of Kong's visit to Beiping and Tianjin. Now that they can be resolved one by one, the financial situation in North China should have a balance of revenue and expenditure from now on (13th).</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Drug Traffickers Arrested in Beiping City</h3>
<p>Possessing Assets of Tens of Millions of Dollars</p>
<p>Authorities Have Already Sealed Off His House</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: In the case of a large batch of heroin being seized by the military and police at the East Railway Station in Beiping a few days ago, it was reported at the time that the raw materials for the drugs were as many as dozens of wooden boxes. The detectives in the team immediately determined that such a large amount of heroin of world-class value could not be handled by small drug traffickers. They used the locations marked on the wooden boxes, which were sent to Xinxiang, Henan, and six counties in Shunde, Hebei, as clues to carry out the arrest. Yesterday, a principal offender was caught from the Xue family at No. 25, Sheep Meat Alley. His name is Xue Yizhi. Under questioning, he fully confessed that he has been trafficking drugs for many years and currently has assets of tens of millions of dollars. The amount of profit he has made and the extent of his business are both very alarming. According to the authorities' research, he has set up this great drug trafficking headquarters in Beiping and has been able to stand undefeated for several years, with contacts reaching several provinces. There must be very complicated means and relationships in this. Therefore, on the one hand, his assets are being sealed off, and on the other hand, his remaining accomplices are being strictly investigated. In terms of its nature, it is no exaggeration to call him one of the largest drug traffickers in Beiping. Today, the Public Security Bureau and the acting mayor have sealed off four of his properties. There are still many other commercial and private properties that are being investigated. The case of Beiping has recently been clearing up household registrations, checking pedestrians every day, and jointly sealing off many Korean residences with Japanese police officers. However, Xue still has such a large-scale drug trafficking situation that is carried out secretly. It can be seen from this that the drug eradication work in the ancient capital is not enough (13th).</p>
<h3>Princes Yun and De Return to Mongolia After Visiting Chiang</h3>
<p>Convening a Conference of Mongolian Banner Representatives</p>
<p>Mongols Shout Support for the Central Government</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Xiao Zhenying, a member of the Beiping Military Branch, was ordered by Chiang to go to Mongolia. On the 6th of this month, he accompanied Princes Yun and De to Suiyuan to meet Chiang and report on the Bai Ling Miao mission. He was then ordered by Chiang to escort Princes Yun and De back to the temple. He was originally scheduled to return to Beiping to report to Chiang, but after returning to Taiyuan the day before yesterday, Chiang had already flown back to Nanchang, so he did not delay and took the Zhengtai car to Shijiazhuang that day, transferred to the Pinghan car, and arrived in Beiping at 8:30 PM on the 12th. He will report to Nanchang after Chiang arrives in Nanchang. The following is a record of Xiao's published remarks: "During my trip to Mongolia this time, when Chairman Chiang visited Beiping, Princes Yun and De sent a telegram requesting him to visit Mongolia for guidance. Chairman Chiang also deeply felt that Inner Mongolia was in a difficult situation and that it was very difficult to maintain the border. The request for guidance was too much to refuse. However, due to the urgency of the inspection, he was afraid that he would not have time to go to Bai Ling Miao in person. Therefore, he sent Ying to convey his condolences on his behalf. Ying and Prince De were old acquaintances. They followed the car from Chahar Province and went to the temple via Pangjiang. They stayed for three days and talked with Princes Yun and De and Mongolian intellectuals from morning to night. Regarding what was said outside, it was mostly because the central government's intentions could not be fully conveyed, and the Mongolian people's grievances could not be fully reported. After conveying the central government's fixed policy of assisting the Mongolian people, Chairman Chiang's condolences, and the usual concern of Chairmen He and Huang, the Inner Mongolian leaders repeatedly consulted and were all very grateful. They sincerely supported the central government. When Chairman Chiang arrived in Suiyuan, they rushed to Suiyuan to welcome him and strongly requested him to visit Mongolia for guidance to comfort the Mongolian people. Chairman Chiang comforted them in every possible way and sent Ying back to answer their intentions from afar. Princes Yun and De informed Mongolia of the process of this trip. Everyone was very satisfied, and all kinds of past misunderstandings were completely dispelled. Ying returned to Sui the next day and went to Taiyuan to report. As soon as he arrived, Chairman Chiang had already taken off and flew south two hours earlier. He plans to report everything after the traveling headquarters is stationed,"</p>
<p>Xiao went to the Beijing Hotel and the Political Readjustment Committee at 8 AM today (13th) to pay his respects to Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and Chairman Huang to report on his trip to Mongolia by order of Chairman Chiang. According to Xiao's interview with reporters, the greatest achievement of this trip to Mongolia was to make the central government's intentions understood by the Mongolian people. When Princes Yun and De returned to Bai Ling Miao from Suiyuan, the Mongolian people welcomed them more than ten li outside the city and wanted to know the details of Chiang's instructions to the two princes. After the two princes returned to the temple, they convened a conference of representatives of various Mongolian banners to report on their visit to Chiang. During the meeting, the emotions of the Mongolian people were enthusiastic, shouting slogans supporting the central government and Long Live the Republic of China, Long Live Chairman Chiang. At this point, the estrangement between the Mongolian people and China has been completely eliminated. (13th)</p>
<h3>Chen Guofu, Jiangsu Provincial Security Commander, Takes Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Security Director and Others Also Swear in at the Same Time</p>
<p>Wu Siyu Sent by the Central Government to Supervise the Oath and Deliver Instructions</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Special Dispatch: Chairman of the Provincial Government and Security Commander Chen Guofu held a swearing-in ceremony at the Provincial Government Auditorium at 10 AM yesterday (15th). At the same time, Security Director Xiang Zhizhuang, Deputy Director Li Shouwei, and the security commanders of the five districts in Jiangbei also took a supplementary oath. Wu Siyu was sent by the Military Affairs Commission to the province to supervise the oath. More than 600 people from all walks of life and officers of the Provincial Security Office were present. Chen wore a general's yellow wool uniform, wore a command knife, and was full of energy. After performing the ceremony as usual, Chen and others raised their hands to take the oath. Then, the oath supervisor delivered instructions, followed by speeches by Zhou Jieren, representative of the Provincial Party Department, and Wang Boling, representative of the Provincial Government. The ceremony ended at 11:00. The speeches are recorded below,</p>
<p>[Instructions from Oath Supervisor Wu Siyu] Everyone, today is the day when Chairman Chen of Jiangsu Province takes office as the Security Commander of Jiangsu Province. I am here to supervise the oath by order of the central government. I will say a few words briefly. Everyone present probably knows about Chairman Chen's efforts and struggles for the party and the country in the past. I don't need to say any more. Security is more important than anything else. In any country or province, if the security situation is good, then the people can live and work in peace and contentment, and all economic, construction and other aspects of society can thrive. Even the implementation of various government orders will be smooth. On the contrary, all industries will be uneasy, rural areas will go bankrupt, and everything in society will decline. The importance of security is so important to the rise and fall of a place. In recent years, Chairman Chiang has worked hard to suppress bandits, because it is necessary to settle domestic affairs before resisting foreign aggression. This has the same meaning as security. Chairman Chen has always studied military affairs and has the talent of both politics and military affairs. He will be able to take on this position with ease. I heard a few days ago that the Jiangsu Security Office has hired many martial arts instructors to train martial arts for the officers and soldiers of the security team. In the future, they will gradually expand the spirit of martial arts to the people, so that the people of the province will be healthy and develop their careers. This alone is enough to show the practical security facilities in Jiangsu. Today, Chen also took office as commander, and it is even more possible to predict the future progress of Jiangsu's security undertakings.</p>
<p>Speech by Wang Boling, Representative of the Provincial Government: Everyone, today is the day when Chairman Chen takes office as the Security Commander of Jiangsu Province. There are no large bandits in Jiangsu now, and the local area is relatively quiet. Why do we need this provincial security commander? In the minds of ordinary people, it is better to have one less military facility. If bandits disappear, then the entire army can be abolished. There must be not a few people who hold this view. The provincial government has something to tell the people about this. The meaning of security seems to be a passive protection of social peace and tranquility. In our country today, this narrow view cannot be taken. Whether Chinese society is truly peaceful is still a question. Even if society is stable, and there are those who snore on the bed, can we eat our fill and sleep soundly alone if these snorers are not removed? To remove these enemies, it is not in the strength of guns and cannons, but in the organization of the people. All the people of the country must be under a systematic organization, each according to their ability, each doing their duty, and gathering all the economic, political, social and all forces of the country, and then they can drive away these enemies. This broad security mission cannot be shouldered by a purely military person. It must be someone who is both military and political to be competent. Therefore, the central government stipulates that the chairman of the province also serves as the security commander, and Chairman Chen can especially meet the above conditions. Chairman Chen's excellent achievements in Jiangsu politics have been recognized by the people. However, Chairman Chen is actually a soldier at the same time, not just a politician. Chairman Chen studied the army and has experienced a lot of military life, but he has no opportunity to perform in the military, so those who know him are less. Now that Chairman Chen is also aware of the position of security commander, he will integrate politics and military affairs in Jiangsu Province from now on and use his strategic and political strategies to achieve the goal of driving away our enemies. On the day of taking office today, the provincial government extends its wishes.</p>
<p>Reply from Chen, Commander of Security: Oath Supervisor. Representatives. Distinguished guests. Today, Guofu takes office as the Security Commander of Jiangsu Province and deeply feels that the responsibility from now on is heavier than before. He will naturally do his best to follow the oath that he swore in all military duties. After listening to everyone's encouragement, I feel that the responsibility and affairs are even more burdensome, and I am even more cautious. In the future, in addition to Guofu's own efforts, I hope that you will supervise and guide me at any time, so that the country and the local area will become more and more prosperous. Today, I am grateful for your speeches and observation of the ceremony.</p>

<p>Hankou Dispatch: Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Provincial Government, citing the abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes in the province, coupled with floods and droughts, resulting in tax revenue shortfalls and significant government funding deficiencies, specially dispatched Jia Shiyi, Director of the Finance Department, to Beijing to earnestly request the Central Government to increase the monthly subsidy by 200,000 yuan on top of the existing 200,000 yuan, and to swiftly allocate funds for disaster relief. Jia contacted the Ministry of Finance in Beijing and secured an agreement for an additional 50,000 yuan per month, as well as approval for the issuance of construction bonds worth five million yuan, secured by the additional 50,000 yuan from the Central Government and the provincial business tax, to be repaid in twelve installments. Jia concluded his business in Beijing and returned to Hankou on the Jianghua Steamer on the 13th, to report the progress to Zhang Qun and plan the implementation. It is reported that the issuance of these bonds has been decided for New Year's Day next year, specifically for the construction of roads. The regulations and rules will be drafted by designated personnel in the coming days, and then submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval. However, the subsidy increased by the Central Government is significantly less than the amount requested by the Provincial Government, and there are still concerns that it will be insufficient for expenditure. Zhang Qun will take the opportunity of attending the Fifth Plenary Session to discuss the matter with Minister Kong and request further increases to facilitate governance. (13th)</p>

<h3>Master and Servant Die in Succession from Illicit Love</h3>
<p>In Nanqianjing, Thirteenth Ward, Datieqiao Township, First District, a farmer surnamed Li, who cultivated a large amount of land, hired Chen Ashan from the same village as a farmhand for many years. This summer, due to the drought in the river, villagers were burning fires day and night for irrigation. Li's daughter, E'e, just reaching marriageable age, was scheduled to marry on December 13th of this year. During a summer evening, while enjoying the cool air, she also helped Chen Ashan to roll the waterwheel, and thus developed a romantic relationship, leading to a secret pregnancy. The woman sought help everywhere to abort the fetus but failed, leading to illness and death on the evening of the 13th. Overwhelmed with grief, Li's mother took the body to Chen Ashan's house to negotiate. Fearing punishment, Chen secretly went to the Li family's grave that night and hanged himself. The incident has been reported by the Township Head, Man Zhiping, to the District Office. The Township Police Officer, Xiao Jinbo, was instructed to report to the court for an inspection. The Prosecutor's Office dispatched Prosecutor Du to lead officials to the village today for an inspection.</p>
<h3>Smuggling to Evade Tariffs Using the Beach</h3>
<p>Jinshanzui Seaport in Punan, belonging to the Eighth District of this county, has seen large quantities of goods from a certain country arrive since the beginning of summer this year. In order to avoid taxation by the Jianghai Customs, they often diverted from Chongming and landed on the beach at Jinshanzui, hiring trucks to transport the goods to Shanghai via the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway. The County Water Patrol Team has cracked down on this once. It is reported that the tax evaded by one ship of goods from that country is close to ten thousand yuan. The unscrupulous merchants collude with the local natives for protection, paying them protection fees, which is still more cost-effective than paying taxes. Moreover, the smuggled goods always carry large quantities of drugs and opium. The local villagers are accustomed to seeing this. It is reported that ships have sneaked in during July, August, and September, and it is recently heard that another large quantity has been transported in. One report says it is private opium. It is unknown whether the local land and water police teams are aware of this.</p>

Now, at around 10 pm on the 11th, more than thirty bandits, speaking with a guest dialect, first used huge stones to break open the doors of Bao Yunyuan and Bao Zhiren's houses. Yunyuan's father, Zhichang, heard the warning and opened the door to escape. The bandits opened fire to chase him. Zhichang hid in a cotton field and escaped. The bandits searched without success, fearing that he would report to the police and they would be surrounded and captured, they hurriedly fled to the southwest.</p>
<h3>Autumn Assessment Set at 83%</h3>

<p>Zhang Fulin, Director of the Construction Bureau of this county, stated that the roadbed of the Wuxi section of the Xihu Highway, from Zhou Shanbang to Yangjian, occupies public and private farmland, and it is urgently necessary to measure and register it to apply to the province for tax exemption. The Bureau is now organizing a surveying team to set out at a scheduled time. All field boundaries, land numbers, and tenant names along the line should be reported in detail to facilitate measurement and compilation of a register. Specifically, at 2 pm yesterday, a meeting was held at the Second District Office of Dongting Town to convene the district chiefs of the First, Second, and Seventh Districts, as well as the township heads, to discuss the procedures. More than thirty district chiefs and township heads attended, chaired by Director Zhang. After discussion, it was decided that when the surveying team arrives for measurement, the local township heads should supervise and assist in the process with the district grain clerks and Zheng (tax officials), and report by the 23rd of this month to apply for provincial tax exemption. Furthermore, the Xihu Road is scheduled to start construction at the end of this month, paving the stone road surface. In addition, the coal cinder paving project for the Huimei section of the Xiyi Road has been completed. The Construction Department has specially dispatched Mei Chengzhuo, Director of the Xihu Road Project, to inspect and accept the project. The required funding is over seven hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Sub-district Practice for Compiling and Investigating Baojia System</h3>
<p>The County Baojia Training Institute of this county held its first training session at the County Government the day before yesterday morning. More than thirty compilation and investigation committee members and assistant district chiefs from various districts attended. County Magistrate Yan reported on the purpose of the Baojia system. In the afternoon, Secretary Ye lectured on laws and regulations, explaining them item by item. Yesterday morning, Section Chief Yu explained the requirements for Baojia compilation and investigation personnel. In the afternoon, Secretary Fei chaired a discussion on the implementation plan for compilation and investigation, and passed the measures for practical compilation and investigation of the Baojia system. It was decided that starting at 8 am today (the 16th), sub-district practical compilation and investigation of the Baojia system will be held. Each district chief, assistant district chief, and compilation and investigation committee member will form a group to practice compilation and investigation, numbering households one by one and sticking temporary doorplates, and immediately inform the household to quickly determine the head of the household, and must compile enough households to form a Bao, that is, at least sixty households, before 11 am. At 11 am, the heads of households will be gathered to explain the essentials of the Baojia system and the matters that the heads of households should know, and then distribute armor to guide the recommendation of the armor chief, and then guide the armor chief to recommend the Bao chief, and inform them of the method of publicly recommending township heads. In the afternoon, the Baojia chiefs will be gathered, the doorplates will be handed over to the Bao chief, the Baojia number and the name of the head of household will be filled in, and the Bao chief and armor chiefs will be guided and supervised to investigate the population in order and fill in the household survey form in detail.

The above procedures must be completed before 5 pm on the same day, and various registers and statistical tables must be prepared and submitted for discussion at the conference the following day.</p>
<h3>Aerial Survey Aircraft Arrives in Wuxi for Measurement</h3>
<p>The measurement of land in this county is cumbersome, so the Provincial Land Bureau stipulates that aircraft will be used for measurement and a contract has been signed with the Aerial Survey Team of the General Staff Headquarters. The aircraft landing site will be borrowed from the Suzhou Airport. It is now known that Aerial Survey Aircraft No. 3 flew from Hangzhou to Suzhou on the 14th. Yesterday (the 15th) at 8:40 am, it flew from Suzhou to Wuxi, circling twice to carry out measurement. The measurement method is aerial photography, but the urban area cannot be aerially surveyed because there are many houses, making it difficult to capture images. Aerial surveying of the area of rural farmland is faster. The aerial survey period is limited to nine months, with four measurements per month. The required funding is about 100,000 yuan, 60,000 yuan for the aerial survey part and 40,000 yuan for the manual part. Once the measurement is completed, the County Land Bureau will send personnel to investigate. The houses in the rural area also need to be measured manually.</p>

<h3>Collecting Escort Fees at Huangtiangang</h3>
<p>Huangtiangang in this county has not been dredged for many years, and the siltation is very severe. Every winter, when the water is shallow, the personnel in charge of the Dingbo Sluice Gate and the water police privately collect illegal fees under the guise of arranging barges. From Huangtiangang to Qingyang along the canal, along the banks of the canal, this has been discovered from time to time. Although former County Magistrate Ma formulated measures to open and close the Dingbo Sluice Gate and maintain navigation, the accumulation of bad practices has not been cleared due to the inconsistency of powers. County Magistrate Bao has taken this into consideration and drafted the Jiangyin County Escort Committee Organization Regulations and the Jiangyin County Measures for Maintaining Huangtiangang Canal Vessels and Collecting Escort Fees, which were submitted to the Party and Government Talk Meeting for approval and submitted to the Provincial Government for approval. All heavy laden vessels passing through Dingbo Sluice Gate and Qingyang Nanxin Bridge will be charged 20 cents per vessel, bamboo rafts will be charged 20 cents per raft, and wood rafts will be charged 40 cents per raft, with a receipt with the county seal issued as proof. In addition, any other arrangements of barges for customs are not subject to fees. If there is any overcharging or extortion, it should be reported to the County Government or the Public Security Bureau. These collection measures have been announced and implemented on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Jingjiang Soil Paste Sold in Chengjing</h3>
<p>The Jingjiang County Smoking Prohibition Committee, because no one has applied to open a soil paste shop and there is nowhere to buy soil paste, has requested the Provincial Smoking Prohibition Committee to instruct the Provincial Government to designate Jiangyin Yuansheng Soil Paste Shop to purchase soil, and ordered the County Smoking Prohibition Committee to inform.</p>

<h3>Construction Department Measures Streets of Provincial Capital</h3>
<p>Shen Baixian, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, considering that the streets of the provincial capital are observed by both domestic and foreign observers and are a model for other counties, has specially dispatched personnel to measure the streets of the provincial capital and create charts for future construction needs. It is now heard that the surveyors have measured the area along Zhengdong Road and will be completed soon.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Pays Attention to Statistical Work</h3>
<p>Since the new committee of the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce took office, Leng Yuqiu, the Standing Chairman of the Chamber, believes it is regrettable that past work has lacked statistics, so he has drafted statistical measures, dividing them into trade surveys and industry-specific classification surveys. He has specially appointed Xu Guosen, a Standing Committee Member, as the statistical commissioner, and is now engaged in collecting various relevant statistical materials and various forms, and has sent personnel to conduct surveys of all industries.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Drivers Strike, Rice Shops Close</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu Public Security Bureau's ban on heavily loaded vehicles entering the city on the 14th was seen by Sun Yaozhang of the general merchandise industry and Jiang Yunlin of the medical industry as being related to commercial transportation, so they gathered at the Chamber of Commerce to discuss it. They nominated Sun and Jiang to go with Xi Yiqi, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, to meet with County Magistrate Ma to discuss relief measures. As a result, County Magistrate Ma telegraphed the Public Security Bureau, informing all branch offices that, in the future, heavily loaded vehicles would be limited to entering the city from 5:00 am to 8:00 am. However, it is heard that the rice industry is still doubtful because the time is too early. It is also heard that those whose heavily loaded vehicles were seized by the Bureau in recent days were fined three yuan each. Today (the 14th), the rickshaw drivers pushing rice, etc., have gone on strike demanding the restoration of free transportation. The rice shops have also closed for one day in an invisible strike.</p>
<h3>First Meeting of Canal Bureau Advisory Committee</h3>
<p>After the Jiangbei Lianhe Engineering Bureau was restored, it specially convened the first advisory committee meeting at 2 pm on the 14th at the general office of the Canal Engineering Bureau. The attendees included county advisory members Xu Xinwu, Han Guojun, and Zhou Shounian, and attending ex officio included Xu Dingkang, Director of the Canal Engineering Bureau, Secretaries Shen Baojun and Shi Zhiying, Section Chiefs Liu Yuyao and Ge Hanlou, and Wu Tongju, a representative from the Construction Department, and 28 others. Han Guojun presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, Secretary Shen, entrusted by Director Xu, reported on the Bureau's plan to reorganize the entire canal project and the status of past work implementation, and then the discussion began. The main points of the discussion were divided into two categories: 1. The operating expenses of the Canal Engineering Bureau should not be drawn from the Mu Donation. The Mu Donation is used as the cost of spring repair and summer defense, and is still insufficient. Therefore, the operating expenses should be allocated from the provincial treasury. It was decided that each attending member would jointly write to the Canal Engineering Bureau and forward the request to the Provincial Government for review. Regarding the engineering costs, it is also appropriate for the province to designate special funds, etc. 2. The management of Huai and the management of the canal must be carried out in a coordinated manner, and opinions should be submitted for reference by the authorities. The key proposals include that the association should urge and forward to the Provincial Government for approval the recommendation by Huaiyang citizens Ma Shu'ang, Bao Xiangzhong, and Dai Tianqiu, as well as advisory members Han Guojun, Chen Bomeng, and Bao Zhizhi, to urgently build embankment revetments to save the lives of people along the canal because bandits can easily breach the current embankment.</p>

<h3>Chief Accountant Dismissed</h3>
<p>Since Shan Wenruo, the Chief Accountant of this county, took office in June this year, he has arbitrarily advanced 445 yuan in salary and recommended as many as six or seven private individuals to the county government. After the Finance Department discovered this and sent personnel to verify the facts, the county was ordered to dismiss him yesterday (the 13th), to clear the advance payment.

<h3>Agencies Temporarily Receive 80% of Funds</h3>

The funds of various agencies could not be paid on a monthly basis, and there were significant arrears. Yesterday (the 13th), the county government convened representatives of various agencies to discuss solutions. It was decided that from the beginning of the year, before the autumn assessment is determined, the funds of various agencies will be temporarily disbursed at 80%, which will be managed by the agencies themselves. However, the funds of the County Party Department are exempt according to the instructions of the Department. The Public Security Bureau and the Security Team are also handled in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Department.</p>

<h3>Unemployed Shop Assistant Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>Tiao Yangquan, a shop assistant at the Shengda Fruit Shop in Dadu, Hushui, Hangzhou, recovered from illness and came to Hangzhou on the 1st of this month to resume work at the shop. However, the shop owner had already hired someone else to replace him due to his prolonged illness, and he was unable to be placed temporarily. Zhou stayed at the shop and was quite depressed. Later, he had financial difficulties after the illness and had the idea of suicide, so he secretly bought red arsenic and swallowed it. After being discovered, he was sent to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. The poison had penetrated deeply, and he died yesterday. The Hangzhou District Court was notified for an inspection, and a coffin was prepared for burial.</p>
<h3>Cloth Shop Fire Causes 10,000 Yuan Loss</h3>

<h3>Large-Scale Looting by Bandits in Dangshan Township</h3>
<p>The home of Mai Desheng, a resident of Yushan Dangshan Township, was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits on the midnight of the 11th of this month. They broke in and each held long and short guns. At that time, two people holding short guns pointed them at Jia's wife and daughter-in-law and shouted, "Don't make a sound, or you will be killed!" At that time, the two were terrified and dared not make a sound, allowing the bandits to search freely. After about an hour, the bandits took all the valuable clothing and other items in the room, worth about six or seven hundred yuan, and fled. Before leaving, they fired five shots. One shot hit a worker surnamed Jia in the lower abdomen, and he fell to the ground and died.</p>

<p>Chairmen of Zhejiang and Shandong Provinces Dispatch Representatives to Express Condolences</p>
<p>The remains of Mr. Shi Liangcai, General Manager of this newspaper, will be placed in a coffin at 2:00 PM this afternoon at his private residence, No. 257 Hardoon Road. The Municipal Government yesterday issued a circular to all subordinate agencies, ordering that flags be flown at half-mast today to mourn the passing of Municipal Councilor Speaker Shi. Yesterday, people from all walks of life came to offer condolences and send wreaths in an endless stream. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Half-Mast in Mourning</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng, considering Mr. Shi's contributions to society during his lifetime and his position as the first Speaker of the Municipal Council, issued an order yesterday to all subordinates to fly flags at half-mast today to express their grief.</p>
<p>Condolences from All Walks of Life</p>

<p>Assisting in the Arrest of the Culprit</p>
<p>Hangzhou authorities apprehended a suspect. According to Mayor Wu yesterday, he had only seen the news in the papers and had not yet received a telegram from Hangzhou. The military and police authorities in this city are actively searching for the culprit, hoping to solve the case as soon as possible. As for the successor to the position of Municipal Council Speaker, it has not yet been considered.</p>
<p>Foreign Press Commentary</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the assassination of Mr. Shi Liangcai on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway on Tuesday has caused the most painful impression in Shanghai. Mr. Shi was talented and accomplished much, earning him widespread reputation in Shanghai. It is a tragedy that the talented Mr. Shi lost his life at the hands of a group of brutal bandits in the prime of his life. Regardless of whether this case has political overtones, it is hoped that the culprits will be apprehended as soon as possible and brought to justice. Shen Bao is one of the oldest and most influential newspapers in China. Mr. Shi, as the general manager, made great contributions to the national life. He was regarded as a leader by the Chinese press and was seen by many foreigners as the "Lord Northcliffe of China". The loss of such talent is particularly regrettable for the press. Mr. Shi was enthusiastic about the University Hospital and charitable societies and was generous in his donations, further enhancing his reputation. Countless undertakings owe their stability to his energy and meticulous planning. Considering all the circumstances, this case must have been carefully planned by an "assassination squad". However, Mr. Shi was never involved in the exclusive affairs of political parties, and the opinions expressed in the newspapers he managed were always steady and appropriate. The true purpose of killing Mr. Shi is difficult to guess. In any case, this kind of crime committed by barbaric means has shocked all circles in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Finance Director Negotiates Public Bond Mortgage with Shanghai Banks</h3>
<p>Decided to Mortgage Three Million Yuan</p>
<p>For Urgent Disaster Relief and Clearing Government Expenses</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to develop local production enterprises and consolidate local debts, issued 20 million yuan of Zhejiang Provincial Local Public Bonds of the Republic of China's 23rd year. The regulations have been approved by the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan and were issued on October 1st. However, the Zhejiang provincial authorities, in view of the severe disaster situation in the province this year, have allocated a portion of the prescribed amount for production enterprises to urgent disaster relief. The remainder will be used for work-for-relief projects. As funds are urgently needed, Wang Chengying, the Director of Finance, has come to Shanghai to negotiate a mortgage with the banking community. There were collective discussions the day before yesterday. According to the reporter's investigation, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Allocated for Urgent Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The 20 million yuan of Zhejiang Provincial Local Public Bonds will use 11 million yuan for production enterprises, and the remaining 9 million yuan will be used to consolidate old debts and clear accumulated government expenses. However, due to the severe disaster situation in Zhejiang Province, some changes have been made to the original budget. Within the originally planned 11 million yuan for production enterprises, 1 million yuan will be handed over to Zhejiang Disaster Relief Funds for full use in work-for-relief. The work-for-relief can not only slightly alleviate the people's difficulties, but also develop the province's construction. As for the 9 million yuan for consolidating old debts and clearing accumulated government expenses, there will be no changes.</p>
<p>Following the Example of Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>After the public bond was approved by the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, it was issued on October 1st. The public bond certificates have also been printed and are expected to be completed around the 20th of this month, and will be officially sold next month. However, the provincial government urgently needs funds for disaster relief. Therefore, Wang Chengying, the Director of Finance, came to Shanghai to negotiate a mortgage with banks such as the Bank of China. Following the previous example of Jiangsu Province, the entire public bond will be mortgaged at 60% of its face value, and the interest rate will also be similar to that of Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>Initial Consultation</p>
<p>The day before yesterday morning, Director Wang gathered managers from various banks at the Bankers Club for an initial consultation. Those who attended included Zhang Gongquan of the Bank of China, Jin Runquan of the Hangzhou Branch, Qian Xinzhi of the Four Banks Savings Society, Zhang Peishen of the Bank of Communications, Xu Jiqing of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Li Fushun of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zou Bingwen of the Shanghai Bank, Wu Yunqi of the Jincheng Bank, Ye Fuzhi of the Continental Bank, Chen Zhehe of the Yanyeh Bank, Hu Bijang of the Zhongnan Bank, and Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, and Zhang Xiaolin, members of the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association. Director Wang stated his opinions on the mortgage, and the banks expressed their willingness to assist. However, they all believed that the total amount of the mortgage was too large, so it is still subject to negotiation. Director Wang expressed his hope that a result could be obtained in the near future.</p>
<p>Continued Collective Discussion</p>
<p>Yesterday, the banks continued to hold collective discussions. It was decided to first mortgage 3 million yuan at 60% of the face value of 5 million yuan. The interest rate is 8% per month. The number of shares borrowed by each bank has not yet been determined. According to a person close to Wang Chengying, the Director of Finance of Zhejiang, Director Wang has accepted the amount of the mortgage. It has been decided to allocate 1 million yuan for urgent disaster relief, and the remaining 2 million yuan will be used to clear accumulated government expenses. The loan contract is being drafted and is expected to be signed within a few days. After the bond certificates are printed and the contract is signed, the funds can be released.</p>

<h3>The Fifteenth Batch of Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhou Lianguan and Three Others</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai on the Rokko Maru</p>
<p>- A Large Number of Overseas Chinese Will Be Expelled Next Spring -</p>
<p>Recently, Japan's expulsion of overseas Chinese has continued unabated. After the fourteenth batch of two overseas Chinese arrived in Shanghai, they were rescued by friends and returned to their hometowns yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, at 4 p.m. yesterday, the fifteenth batch of expelled overseas Chinese, Zhou Lianguan, Zhu Yuxing, Zhang Tingkai, and three others, returned to the country on the Rokko Maru and stayed at the Lao Gongxin and Yuelai Inns. The Industrial and Commercial News reporter interviewed that Japan's persecution of overseas Chinese has recently become more intense. A large number of overseas Chinese will be expelled back to the country next spring, but the current method of continuous expulsion is still being adopted. The Japanese government sends police to patrol the streets every day. When they encounter overseas Chinese, they immediately arrest them, search their bodies arbitrarily, leave only a small amount of money, and expel them back to the country. Some even sell the clothes or parts on their bodies to pay for travel expenses. Therefore, the overseas Chinese who came to Shanghai this time are not only penniless, but also all their scattered belongings have been sold out. Their future livelihoods are extremely difficult.</p>

<h3>Women's Representatives Return Yesterday After Petitioning, Hosting a Reception for the Press</h3>
<p>If There Is No Solution at the Next Legislative Yuan Meeting</p>
<p>Decision to Unite Women's Circles in Various Places to Strive Again</p>
<p>The Shanghai women's circles went to Beijing to petition for equal legal rights for men and women. They returned to Shanghai in batches yesterday. The China Women's Society hosted a reception for reporters and announced the process. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Returning to Shanghai in Batches</p>
<p>The Shanghai China Women's Progressive Association, Women's League, and China Women's Society believe that the provisions of Article 239 of the Criminal Law and Article 211 of the Civil Law violate the principle of equal legal rights for men and women. Therefore, they went to Beijing in batches on the 11th to petition. The authorities have agreed to abide by the teachings of the Prime Minister and re-submit them to the Legislative Yuan for review, in order to achieve the principle of equality between men and women. The representatives are satisfied. Jin Guangmei and Yang Zhihao, representatives of the Women's Association, arrived in Shanghai at 7 a.m. yesterday, and Lu Fengxiang, a representative of the League, returned to Shanghai last night. Xia Zhenhua, a representative of the Women's Society, will return this morning.</p>
<p>Hosting the Press</p>
<p>The Women's Progressive Association hosted reporters from various newspapers at the Yiyou Society on Three Horse Road yesterday afternoon, with more than 20 people attending. Chairman Jin Guangmei gave a speech at the meeting, saying, "Since the establishment of this association, we have received the assistance of all gentlemen, and we have made progress today. This time, we went to Beijing to petition, and we have been warmly promoted, so we can arouse the sympathy of all walks of life and receive a satisfactory answer. I am deeply grateful, but I apologize for the inadequate reception."</p>
<p>The Petition Process</p>
<p>Then, she reported on the petition process, saying, "After the representatives of this association arrived in Beijing, they contacted and discussed with the local women's circles and unanimously strived for it. The next morning, they met with Chen Bijun, Jiao Yitang, and other important figures of the Party and the country, and when they petitioned the ladies of the members of the Central Committee and the National Committee, Liang Cao Han, the Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, generously agreed to reconsider. When we petitioned the Central Political Council, President Wang, President Sun, Tang Youren, and others were able to give us sympathy. The purpose of our petition this time can be divided into: 1. To consolidate the soundness of the family organization, in order to comply with the principles of governing the family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world; 2. To strengthen the relationship between Fu and Yue, in order to achieve a strong country and a strong people; 3. To change the licentious customs, so that society can be peaceful." Then Yang Zhihao reported, and the rest is omitted.</p>
<p>Jin Guangmei Talks</p>
<p>The Shanghai women's circles in Beijing held a joint meeting with the local women's circles, and decided: 1. To issue a joint telegram in the name of the women's circles in Shanghai and Beijing to all female compatriots in the country to unanimously advocate; 2. To send a letter to Wang Guangmei, a member of the Legislative Yuan, and to the reporter of the New Voice News Agency, saying that the Legislative Yuan will hold a meeting on Friday, so there may be a formal solution at that time. If it is still not changed, we will decide to contact the women's circles in Hangzhou, Suzhou, and other places to strive for equality."</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Tycoon Chen Laichang Went to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Negotiate with the Authorities on Promoting Domestic Products</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Talks About the Recent Situation in Singapore</p>
<p>Chen Laichang, a tycoon of overseas Chinese in Nanyang, embarked on the French mail ship D'Artagnan from Singapore to return to China. After arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, he stayed at the New Asia Hotel and took the Beijing-Shanghai Road night express train to Beijing last night to negotiate with the authorities on promoting domestic products in Nanyang. The New News Agency reporter met Mr. Chen at the station yesterday and recorded everything he told him below:</p>
<p>Recent Situation in Singapore</p>
<p>Mr. Chen told the New News Agency reporter, "I went overseas 30 years ago and experienced hardship. Fortunately, I was able to start a family from scratch. Many people say that I have succeeded in my career, but who knows that success comes from failure. To create a business and accomplish a thing, you must go through many failures and struggles to succeed. As the saying goes, 'If you can endure the hardships of hardship, you can be a superior person.' In view of the recent global depression, it has become universal and white-hot. Malaya is also difficult to escape. However, in recent years, the prices of local products (such as rubber and tin) have risen due to the currency war in various countries, and the market has gradually shown signs of recovery. Unfortunately, the price of silver fluctuates, which makes it difficult to import domestic products. I hope that the Ministry of Finance, in addition to restrictions, will implement effective measures to stabilize the exchange rate of domestic currency."</p>
<p>Cultural Undertakings</p>
<p>As for culture, thanks to the efforts of the authorities of Chinese schools and major bookstores, which compete to sell new publications from the motherland at low prices, the education of overseas Chinese has made significant progress in recent years. This is gratifying to the compatriots of the motherland. I lost my studies in my childhood, and I regret it too late. I especially hope that the educational undertakings of the motherland can be popularized overseas.</p>
<p>Reasons for Returning to the Country</p>
<p>The purpose of my return to the country this time is to report to the central authorities on the recent overseas Chinese affairs in Singapore, and I also intend to ask the Ministry of Industry to exempt domestic products from export taxes, so that domestic products can be sold well overseas, in order to recover the lost rights. At the same time, I will go to various places to inspect domestic products and investigate commerce. Therefore, this return to the country is different from ordinary travel. The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to the Consul General in Singapore to send a telegram to the Central Committee, instructing the Overseas Chinese Reception Office to treat me according to the case.</p>
<p>Went to Beijing Last Night</p>
<p>Because the agreed date for going to Beijing has arrived, it is not convenient to delay. I will go to Beijing first tonight (i.e. last night). After reporting to Wang Jingwei, President of the Central Executive Yuan, Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, and Chen Jiren of the Overseas Affairs Committee, I will invite the Overseas Chinese in Nanyang to negotiate everything in the shortest period of time.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Mr. Chen</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Laichang, also known as Tongzhao, is originally from Fenghua. He is 49 years old this year. He has been in Singapore for 33 years. He has invested in Wanyu Wood Factory, Overseas Chinese Domestic Products Co., Ltd., Overseas Chinese Bank, and Straits Tin Smelting Company. He is currently the President of the Singapore Sanjiang Guild Hall and the Chairman of the Sanjiang Association.</p>

<p>Invoices, Receipts, and Disaster Relief Forms Should Be Reduced</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Central Political Council yesterday, urging the amendment of the stamp tax rate. The original text says, "The stamp tax law passed by the Legislative Yuan stipulates the tax rate for invoices, disaster relief forms, and receipts, which is inconsistent with Articles 5 and 6 of the principles of the stamp tax law decided by the 383rd meeting of your Council last year. The subordinate associations telegraphed your Council on October 13 to request correction in accordance with your powers, but no reply has been received. Recently, it was reported that the National Government issued an instruction to the Legislative Yuan on the 9th to amend Chapter 3 of the stamp tax law. According to the description in the original instruction, it is based on the letter from the Executive Yuan and the resolution of the 413th meeting of your Council. However, the points that the order refers to for amendment only focus on the excessively light penalty, which is amended to a fine of 5 yuan, and does not mention the excessive taxation of invoices, disaster relief forms, and receipts, which violates the principles formulated by your Council. How can we take into account the national legislative principles and the major wishes of merchants? As the saying goes, 'Equal application of things should be implemented.' When the country formulates taxes, it should be familiar with the trend of human feelings. What should be light should be light, and what should be heavy should be heavy. Now, the light penalty is increased, while the heavy tax is not reduced. How can it be the way to equally apply things? Invoices, receipts, disaster relief forms, etc. have very short storage times and minimal voucher validity. They are the most common items used by merchants. This time, the National Government's order also cited them, but it uniquely taxes these three items at 1/1000 of the value of the goods. The three items add up to a total of 3/1000. The situation is actually levying a business tax again in addition to the business tax, which greatly violates the principle of 'short use time and light taxation' of your order. If this is not corrected, how can the national policies be consistent from beginning to end? How can the reasonable petitions of merchants be obeyed with conviction? We respectfully submit again, and we hope that your Council will comply with the merchant's situation and approve the handling in accordance with the previous telegram, which is for the public benefit." Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Members of the National Federation of Private Electricity Companies Returned to Shanghai from Fujian Yesterday</h3>
<p>The 6th Annual Meeting of the National Federation of Private Electricity Companies was held in Fujian from the 1st to the 3rd of this month. After the meeting, they visited the Rural Electrification Experimental Zone in Kengong Township, run by the Fuzhou Electric Company, and toured famous scenic spots. They were then invited by the Xiamen Gulangyu Electric, Telephone, and Water Companies. Chen Yunshan, Liu Yafu, Sun Shihua, and other gentlemen from the Fuzhou Company personally accompanied them on the Jing'an special ship. They were warmly welcomed by all walks of life in the port. A welcome meeting was held at the Huang Yizhu Mansion. There were practical discussions on electrical construction. After visiting Xiamen, they took the original ship to Wenzhou on the 8th to participate in the annual meeting of the Zhejiang Branch. Then, on the 12th, they started the ship. Except for the members of the Zhejiang Branch who stayed in Wenzhou for the meeting, more than 100 members from various provinces and cities, led by Chairman Wang Shucheng, returned to Shanghai. Liu Yafu and Sun Shihua also personally accompanied them. They encountered wind and waves on the way, and only arrived in Shanghai at 2 a.m. yesterday. During this 10+ day trip to Fujian for the conference, they were united in spirit and focused in will, with the goal of developing the electricity industry and promoting production. The result was extremely satisfactory. The Director of the Electrical Department of the Construction Committee also returned to Shanghai on the same ship and took a train to Beijing at 1 a.m. yesterday.</p>
<h3>Hu Wenhu Donates Cautiously</h3>
<p>Du Yuesheng and Lin Kanghou Joint Statement</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that Hu Wenhu, a wealthy overseas Chinese merchant from Nanyang, has returned to Hong Kong in the enthusiastic send-off of people from all walks of life. However, in recent days, it has been widely rumored that Mr. Hu donated a total of more than 500,000 yuan this time. In addition to charitable organizations taking up the majority, there is a saying that Mr. Hu is unwilling to announce the donation to schools and certain organizations, which has caused doubts among people from all walks of life. Recently, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency talked to someone close to Mr. Hu, saying, "The donation is true this time. As for the donation to schools and certain organizations, it is not true. There is no reason why he would not or could not announce a donation that has already been made. Moreover, Mr. Hu has always been cautious about the recipients of his donations, fearing that he would be criticized and violate his original intention. Therefore, Mr. Hu only donated to charitable organizations this time. This is also a manifestation of Mr. Hu's caution about donations."</p>
<p>The National News Agency reports that Hu Wenhu's return to China for sightseeing has been very supportive of public welfare undertakings. It has also been said that he specially entrusted Du Yuesheng and Lin Kanghou to allocate and handle all donation affairs. Yesterday, Du Yuesheng and Lin Kanghou specially issued a joint statement to the National News Agency reporter, saying that during Hu Wenhu's visit to Shanghai, they participated in social events as a duty of the hosts. As for the donation affairs, they were specially entrusted to allocate and handle them. The truth is that they had neither heard of this matter beforehand nor knew anything about it afterwards. We solemnly declare the truth.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Shaanxi as Described in a Letter from Yin Zhufu</h3>
<p>The following is a transcription of a letter from Yin Zhufu in Chang'an to Zhao Housheng, describing the local situation in Shaanxi Province. It is extremely important, and is thus specially recorded below. The letter reads, "My dear Brother Housheng, I have not heard from you in a long time, and I miss you very much. I hope you are well. I arrived in Shaanxi on the fifth day of last month, and it has already been a month. I have been busy with social engagements and sightseeing in various places, and have not had a moment to settle down. I apologize for not writing sooner. I was here twenty years ago, and stayed for a month. Now I have returned for three years in the blink of an eye. Comparing the past and the present, I feel that the weather is now favorable (there is a saying that there is a major drought every thirty years and a minor drought every ten years. After years of drought, this year there is a bumper harvest, and because of the sparse population and simple agricultural technology, one year's harvest is enough to feed people for three years. In addition, the Jing, Wei, and Luo three canals are gradually nearing completion, which will reduce drought disasters to some extent). There has also been progress in human affairs (bandits in various prefectures are fewer than before. There are some bandits in the north, but capable troops have been sent to suppress them, and they will not be difficult to eliminate. Civil administration, finance, and social undertakings are also all progressing. I have passed through several counties and found that the selection of county magistrates is quite good. Dozens of unreasonable taxes have been abolished in finance. Forty-one counties in which opium poppy seedlings were banned from planting (out of more than ninety counties in the province) have mostly switched to growing cotton. People's lives are much more stable than in the past few years. From July last year to July this year, more than 42 million catties of cotton were exported, worth more than 12 million yuan. Much more has been planted this year, and the quantity will certainly be even more impressive). However, Shaanxi Province is divided into the northern, central, and southern parts (namely, Yulin, Guanzhong, and Hanzhong). The central part is closer to being on track, while the northern and southern parts require more time to be reorganized due to inconvenient transportation. There are many famous scenic spots and historical sites here, as on the Shanyin Road, and it is difficult to take them all in. I have been sightseeing for a month, and have only seen a small part of them. The magnificent Taibai Mountain cannot be visited due to the cold weather and mountain conditions. I can only wait for another day. If a tour group can be organized by friends in the spring and summer of next year to visit this place, it will be very interesting. Moreover, the people here have low levels of knowledge (about eighty or ninety percent of women in rural areas have bound feet, and some men also have queues or longer hair. Education is not very widespread). The organization is extremely rudimentary. The Longhai Railway will reach Xi'an by the end of next month, and the number of motor roads is also increasing day by day. In the near future, social conditions will inevitably change (land in the suburbs of Xi'an, which was worth thirty or forty yuan per mu a year ago, now costs up to two thousand yuan per mu near the station. Government land is divided into three grades, and the highest grade sells for eighteen hundred yuan. The same is true for remote areas within the city. When I came here twenty years ago, land prices were very low). If there is no adequate education, then as the standard of living rises and transportation becomes more convenient, the peasants will remain ignorant and disorganized, which will inevitably lead to increasing prosperity in the cities and increasing impoverishment in the countryside, resulting in a malformed development. This will have an impact on the future development of the Northwest. You, my brother, are an advanced educator and are enthusiastic about social undertakings. If you can spare the time to come here for a visit and provide guidance and planning, it will be very beneficial. Also, if the China Vocational Education Society can set up a branch here, it will have considerable effect. I wonder what you think. I will be returning soon. If I have time to spare, I plan to travel to Hubei and Jiangxi before returning to Shanghai in the early part of next month. I have written in a rambling manner and have not exhausted all that I wish to say. I wish you peace. Your brother, Zou Qian, November 6th."</p>
<h3>Confirmation of the Tongfu Steamer Incident</h3>
<p>No News of the Entire Crew</p>
<p>Families Have Requested Compensation from the Company</p>
<p>The Tongfu steamer of the Tongan Steamship Company, located at 9 Fuzhou Road, had an accident in the Korean waters. All fifty-six crew members, from the shipowner to the last, did not return alive. This event happened twelve days ago. At first, it was impossible to prove its reality, but later the family of Yang Yikun, the chief engineer of the ship, entrusted other sea vessels to investigate the truth of the accident of Tongfu. Now it has received accurate information that the ship has sunk. Currently, the families of each crew member have been negotiating with the Tongan Company to demand compensation. The details are described below:</p>
<p>Ship History</p>
<p>The Tongfu steamer has a total carrying capacity of 2,350 tons and a cargo capacity of 1,900 tons. The ship was originally an Italian ship. Two years ago, it transported dozens of greyhounds to Shanghai for the dog racing track. It was found by the Jianghai Customs, who detained the ship and confiscated the dogs. When the customs auctioned it, Bao Anfu purchased it, renamed it Tongfu, and operated it on the coastal lines of the North and South Seas. This year, it was leased to the Japanese merchant Murata Yoko to transport goods to Dalian, Japan, and other places. Unexpectedly, it suddenly sank on the 2nd of this month.</p>
<p>Details of the Incident</p>
<p>The ship left Otaru, Japan, at 7:00 AM on the 26th of last month, loaded with wood. The shipowner was a Westerner named Sakharoff. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, the ship arrived in Korean waters, at a place called Heishan Island. It encountered a strong wind and fog and immediately hit a reef and was breached. Seawater flooded into the cabins. Although the ship sent out a distress telegram, it sank in an instant. At that time, the coastal radio station received this distress signal and notified the Murata Company to quickly send a ship to the site of the accident for rescue, but there was no trace.</p>
<p>Loss of Crew</p>
<p>The ship had a total of fifty-six crew members and sailors, including the shipowner. The chief engineer, Yang Yikun, was a member of the local marine engineers' association. When the ship encountered the accident, there was a strong wind, so no one escaped alive. All were completely submerged in the sea. It has been thirteen days since, and not a single body has been recovered. Its cruelty is rarely encountered in recent shipwrecks. The rescue ship sent by Murata searched the area around Heishan Island according to the reported location for three days and three nights. Until the 7th, no trace was found, and they returned to Japan to report.</p>
<p>Request for Investigation</p>
<p>Most of the crew members' families are in Shanghai. Upon receiving this warning, they went to the Tongan Company to inquire every day, but there was no definite news. The families of the crew members then pleaded with the Marine Engineers' Association to entrust various sea vessels to investigate on their behalf during navigation, and sent telegrams to various nearby radio stations to inquire. As a result, they only learned that the Tongfu had encountered an accident and had sunk after hitting a reef in a strong wind. Whether the crew members survived was still uncertain.</p>
<p>Original Report</p>
<p>The report from the entrusted investigation arrived in Shanghai yesterday, stating briefly that the Tongfu left Otaiu on October 26th loaded with timber. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, the ship encountered an accident and requested assistance off Heishan Island on the southern coast of Korea. The Murata Company immediately sent a rescue ship to the site of the accident and searched for three days and nights, but found no trace. It was found that in addition to the wood loaded in the cargo hold, there were also more than 1,000 logs on the deck. Inspections are currently being carried out in various places, and inquiries are being made to various radio stations. After several days of detailed investigation, some said that it sank due to water entering the cargo hold, and others said that it sank after hitting a reef in a strong wind. It is difficult to know exactly what happened. Whether the families of the employees on the ship know this, please inform them.</p>
<p>Request for Compensation</p>
<p>Under the investigation of various parties, the families of the crew and sailors have learned that the lives of all fifty-odd people have likely been lost with the ship and buried in the belly of the fish. The families of the crew members who died in the disaster have been negotiating with the Tongan Company for days, requesting compensation so that orphans and widows can live. Bao Anfu himself is said to be in Japan. The company has other people in charge. This time, the ship insurance was insured in Japan, so there has been no concrete indication of the request of the crew members' families.</p>

<h3>Continued Trial of Kuang Huian and Others, Perpetrators of the Renji Hospital Bloodshed</h3>
<p>Prisoners in the Ma Shaowu Case Brought in for Confrontation</p>
<p>Investigation Clarifies Basic Facts of the Case</p>
<p>Xiong Guohua, a self-confessed Communist, was attacked by members of a Communist assassination squad in the Qianji Hotel on Shanxi Road on the night of September 16th. They broke into his room and shot and wounded him. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by the police, and Detective Wan Yuke was stationed at the hospital to guard him. Unexpectedly, at 3:30 PM on September 26th, the thugs again broke into the hospital with weapons and shot and killed Xiong. Detective Wan and a Chinese policeman escorting a sick prisoner to the hospital were also killed without resistance at the same time. Afterwards, the police authorities launched a thorough investigation and, after an all-night effort, captured ten male and female thugs, including Kuang Huian, and seized twenty-seven pistols and Mauser pistols, a steel vest, and various reactionary printed materials belonging to the group at the Xinwenxiang Silver Shop in the French Concession. Later, the police investigation revealed that the cases of Ma Shaowu and Chen Jing, former secret agents of the Public Security Bureau, being killed and wounded by gunshots were all committed by Kuang Huian directing his gang members. They were prosecuted by the Second Branch of the High Court, and several interrogations have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, the Second Branch of the High Court Criminal Division Chief Yu Ye and Prosecutor Zhong Qing opened court to continue the interrogation. Chinese and Western detectives escorted ten men and women, including Kuang Huian, Zhao Xuan, Tang Wanxuan, Lin Er'mei, Meng Huating, Zhu Jinming, Li Yangshi, Li Zhoushi, Liu Jinrong, and Zhang Lishi, to the court. Yuan Youfang, Dong Jiquan, and Ou Zhiguang, three members of the "Dog-Beating Gang" who had been sentenced and imprisoned in the Western Prison, were also brought to the court by detectives for confrontation with Kuang and others regarding the Ma Shaowu case. Judge Yu asked the three prisoners if they knew Kuang Huian and Meng Huating. Yuan, Dong, and Ou all said that they did not know them, but Kuang and Meng both said that they knew the three prisoners, saying that Yuan was called A Fang, Dong was called Little Ghost, and Ou was called Old Yuan. Then, Western detectives reported that the deceased Xiong Guohua had been identified as having served in the Northeast Volunteer Army during his lifetime. Judge Yu then asked Meng Huating when he joined the Communist Party and the reason for killing Xiong. According to Meng's confession, he joined the Communist Party in Yangliuqing, Hebei, in the year before last, and came to Shanghai last spring. He said that Xiong was killed because he betrayed the Republic of China, because Xiong had colluded with the Japanese puppets in the Northeast to kill volunteer soldiers. Zhu Jinming confessed that he joined the Communist Party in Shangrao County, Jiangxi, in June of the year before last. Li Yangshi and Li Zhoushi, mother and daughter-in-law, stated that her son and her husband, Li Ziqing, left home in June and never returned. The mother and daughter-in-law pawned their belongings to make a living. This time, they moved to the Hongxiang Hotel on Avenue Road to return to their hometown and had not joined the Communist Party. Liu Jinrong and Zhang Lishi both stated that they met while working in a factory. After 3:00 PM on September 27th, they agreed to go to the Hongxiang Hotel to open a room and were arrested and had not joined the Communist Party. Tang Wanliu, a police officer from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, testified that Tang Wanxuan was his younger brother and had been recommended to work as a gatekeeper in Yongchang Lane on Father Tou-Se-Wei Road through a friend and was not a member of the Communist Party. Lan Xuzhang, from the same rental office, also testified that Tang was indeed hired as a gatekeeper. At this point, Judge Yu considered that the facts of the case had been largely clarified and ordered that the prisoners be returned to custody separately to await a scheduled public trial.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Various Local Charities</h3>
<p>Decision to Start Preparing Shelters Early</p>
<p>Thirteen Thousand Yuan Already Pledged</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Federation held a joint meeting of various charities at Renji Hall on Yunnan Road at 4:00 PM yesterday. Thirteen thousand yuan was pledged on the spot. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>In addition to Huang Han, the attendees included Fei Juntang from the Daowei Zhongshan Hall, Sun Yishan from the Hunan Charity Association of Shanghai, Wang Binyan and Cai Yuanfu from the Zhabei Charity Group, the Women and Children Relief Association, Wang Zhongfu from the Guangyi Charity Hall, Wang Junsheng from the Pushan Villa, Guo Kaoquan from the Shanghai Public Hospital, Zhang Xianqing from the Chinese Jisheng Association, Xu Qianlin from the Chinese Moral Society, Ye Shanhai from the Xinpu Nursery Hall, Lu Wenzhong from the Lianyi Charity Association, Fang Zhijun from the Renji Charity Hall, Chen Jie-feng from the Renji Infant Nursery, Chen Wenkui from the Disability Institute, Wang Yiting from the Shanghai Charity Association Tongren Fuyuan Hall, and more than twenty other representatives.</p>
<p>Important Matters Resolved</p>
<p>Wang Yiting was elected as chairman and the meeting began as scheduled. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and then the discussion focused on the funding for the shelter. It was resolved that the amount pledged by each charity would remain the same as last year (i.e., the previous year), and the associations that were not present at the meeting would be notified in writing. Second, the Social Bureau wrote that the Tongren Fuyuan Hall had advanced food rations for refugees passing through the area for three months in July, August, and September, totaling five hundred and forty-three yuan and four jiao. As the association's funds were insufficient, the question was how to handle the matter. It was resolved that the cost of the refugees' rations would be paid by the charitable organization. Third, Mr. Xi Yunsheng wrote that the Huilv Hospital Huisheng Charity Society's membership fee should be waived due to financial constraints. It was resolved that a letter be sent to Mr. Du Yunsheng, requesting that he make an effort to pay the membership fee as usual to maintain the association's affairs. Fourth, Deputy Committee Member Huang proposed that when the committee's term expires and it is re-elected, one more vice-chairman should be added and the association's constitution should be amended. It was resolved that this should be passed.</p>
<p>Pledges Made On the Spot</p>
<p>Each charity would pledge according to the amount it donated in the previous year. For those who did not attend, written notice could be used.

It is planned that your association will donate XX yuan as in the previous year, and we hope that you will allocate it as soon as possible to facilitate preparation and benefit the people. Attached is the minutes of the meeting, please check it for your reference.]</p>
<h3>Art Doctor Teng Baiye Creates a Statue of Pan Hongsheng</h3>
<p>To Be Given to the Martyr's Family After Completion</p>
<p>The patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng sacrificed himself for the public good, and we deeply admire him. Dr. Teng Baiye, director of the Art Department of Shanghai University, recently wrote to the funeral committee of the patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng, proposing to sculpt a statue of Pan to last forever. Sculpting has now begun and is expected to be completed in about a month. After the statue is completed, it will be given to the funeral committee of the patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng to be forwarded to the martyr's family.</p>
<h3>Panic Among Merchants and Residents in Shengjia Lane, Tangqiao, Pudong</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, there have been six fires in the area of Shengjia Lane, east of Tangqiao in Pudong. The most recent one occurred at around 10:30 PM on the 20th day of the ninth lunar month, when the Xinshunxing Rice Shop warehouse was burned down, even killing the shop owner's father (nicknamed A Han, 49 years old). However, there are many suspicious points in the repeated fires. All of them started outdoors, such as outside the gate or next to the bamboo fence. According to eyewitnesses, they were all arson attacks motivated by grudges. The perpetrators would wait until late at night when people were unprepared, use straw to wrap the door and bamboo fence, pour kerosene on it, and then set it on fire. According to the cause of the grudge, these people would not succeed in owing goods from the shops, so they use this cruel method to vent their personal grievances. Therefore, in recent days, all the shops in the area have been greatly panicked, as if a major disaster is imminent. They intend to jointly petition the police station in charge to request protection and secretly investigate the arsonists so that they can be charged and arrested by the court.</p>
<h3>Editor-in-Chief of Manila People's Newspaper Comes to Shanghai to Discuss Inaccuracy of Restrictions on Chinese Merchants in the Philippines</h3>
<p>The Proposal Was Shelved Without Debate in the Assembly</p>
<p>The event of the Philippines restricting Chinese merchants has been of great concern recently. Fuleren, the editor-in-chief of Manila People's Newspaper and a major newspapers, recently arrived in Shanghai. Today, he expressed the following views to the National News Agency regarding this matter. Recently, I read a news report from Nanjing saying that the National Government expressed considerable concern over the Philippine government's restrictions on Chinese business operations. I am very familiar with the situation here. I would like to clearly state that the Philippine government does not have any such campaign, nor has it encouraged this matter. As for the Philippine leaders having the power to influence the legislators, they have not taken any steps to restrict Chinese merchants. In fact, the government is striving to encourage the development of trade with China and to bring the Chinese people closer together. The Philippine Assembly did have a proposal to unify the domestic commerce of the Philippines under the operation of the nationals, ordering all foreign merchants, such as Chinese and Japanese merchants, to close their businesses within two years, with the exception of Americans. This proposal may become a reality after many years. However, judging from the current economic situation of the Philippine people, it is difficult to implement it at this time. Therefore, although the content of the proposal is so intense, the responsible leaders in the Assembly have never formally considered it. Furthermore, according to recent news from Manila, the proposal has already been shelved. Its failure to pass can show the attitude of the Assembly and the people it represents towards the proposal. The proposal was shelved without debate. However, I still have something to say, that is, the Chinese have always had very friendly relations with us. For hundreds of years, they have almost monopolized the commerce in our country. However, recently, Chinese merchants have greatly declined, and have lost a large part of their sphere of influence. Those who have gained it are the Japanese. Chinese business has recently fallen from nine-tenths to five-tenths, while Japanese merchants have jumped from zero to two-tenths in the past five years. Therefore, Philippine scholars believe that if Chinese merchants are so depressed, why not let the Filipinos take it for themselves rather than let others profit from it? We certainly love the Chinese merchants, but for other irrelevant people, we should take our own rights as a premise. However, China does not need to worry too much, because in the future, even if the Filipinos intend to control domestic operations, they must proceed by legal means and free competition. Moreover, the Chinese in the Philippines all abide by the law and can join the Philippine nationality at any time in accordance with the law, so they will be able to obtain fair treatment in the future. Now that the independence and autonomy of the Philippines can be realized, the Chinese and Philippine peoples, with their friendship, should have further opportunities to connect with each other culturally and commercially. As we prepare to take on independent responsibilities, we are creating extensive internal and external policies. How should our neighboring Chinese government, people, and manufacturing industry prepare a practical plan to connect with us? Take the opportunity of our establishment of a constitution and organization of government next year, and show our goodwill to us. Time is running out. We, the Philippine people, are all eager to cooperate with each other to bring the relationship between the two countries to a mutually beneficial level.</p>
<h3>The First Horticultural Exhibition Opened Yesterday Morning at the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>More Than 100 Kinds of Horticultural Items Were on Display</p>
<p>The Mayor and Other Celebrities Visited</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Niu Yongjian and Others Personally Wrote Inscriptions</p>

<h3>Old Painter's Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Li Xiujin's Identity Undetermined</p>
<p>Self-Petition Case Has Been Rejected Yesterday</p>
<p>Cheng Yaosheng, a famous painter from Anhui, is 66 years old. Recently, he was accused by Li Xiujin, a woman from Wujin, in the name of his wife, of abandonment in the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the First Special Court opened a criminal court for questioning. Cheng Yaosheng is blind and was helped to the court by someone. Judge Feng immediately asked if Li Xiujin's accusation had been made clear. He replied that he knew, but she was not his wife and asked the plaintiff to provide relevant evidence. Feng then declared to Li Xiujin that the defendant now denied that she was his wife, so her identity was not clear. She should file a lawsuit in the Civil Court to confirm her identity, and then resume alimony after her identity was confirmed. Why file a criminal suit? It is better to withdraw this case and file a lawsuit in the Civil Court. Li replied that she would decide after discussing this matter. The court declared that the plaintiff had filed a suit in the capacity of his wife, and according to law, spouses cannot file a self-petition, so it was ruled that the self-petition was rejected.</p>
<h3>Singer Sues Lang Guozhen</h3>
<p>Please Fulfill the Agreement of Cohabitation</p>
<p>Negotiation Failed Yesterday</p>
<p>Lang Guozhen (also known as Lang Lisheng), currently the manager of China Automatic Telephone Company and a native of Kunshan, residing at No. 58, Hengsheng Lane, Hart Road, Shanghai West, met singer Jin Xiaoxiang in Beiping in the 14th year of the Republic of China. At that time, Jin was at a beautiful age, excelling in both appearance and talent. Lang was deeply infatuated with her. Because Jin's family was from Yushan, and due to the kinship with Su Xiaoxiao, he showed her extra care and attention. As they spent more time together, they fell in love. Lang advised Jin not to move to another place to work as a singer, promising that if she would follow him to Shanghai, he would grow old with her and marry her forever. He even gave Jin a photograph as proof. Jin believed his words were sincere, so she agreed to his proposal, immediately ended her career as a singer, and followed him to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, after Jin arrived in Shanghai, Lang completely went back on his word. Not only did he not marry her, but he also avoided her as if she were a plague. Jin felt deceived and could only lament her misfortune. Since then, she has been adrift at sea, almost ten years passing in an instant. Her youthful beauty has faded, and she has grown older. Reflecting on this wasted time, she realized it was all due to Lang's breach of promise and lack of faith. Therefore, she hired lawyer Wu Peng to file a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the First Special District Court, recounting how she was abandoned by Lang, stating that Lang now has other women while discarding the person he once vowed to grow old with, treating her like worn-out shoes, which is extremely unfair. She requested that Lang Guozhen be summoned to court as soon as possible for mediation according to the law, ordered to fulfill the cohabitation agreement, and bear the responsibility of providing for her, so as to avoid starvation and cold, and to protect women's rights. Yesterday afternoon, the mediation court summoned them. Lang also hired lawyer E Sen to represent him. After questioning by Judge Tao, because the two parties could not reach an agreement, mediation failed, and they were ordered to withdraw and file a formal lawsuit, awaiting a scheduled hearing.</p>

They were all taken back to the police station, detained separately, and sent to the Ninth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning, charged under Article 36 of the Shanghai Municipal Council By-laws and Section 3 of Article 43 of the Punishable Offenses Act. After Zhu Mengwei reported the circumstances, Wang Xiaomei and Zhu Aying admitted to engaging in prostitution. Wang Aier denied soliciting customers for Wang Xiaomei and others, claiming to be a tailor at Changxing Company on Xiangshan Road, Zhabei. Judge Shen Shanzeng reviewed the confession and sentenced Wang Xiaomei and Zhu Aying to a fine of twelve yuan each as a warning, and confiscated the obscene objects.

<h3>Lawyer Zhu Lanjia Accused of Underreporting Land Sale Price</h3>
<p>Both Parties Reached a Settlement and Withdrew the Lawsuit</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhu Lanjia, also known as Tianren, is a native of Huaiyin, Jiangsu. He joined the Shanghai Bar Association in April of the 21st year of the Republic of China and practiced law in Shanghai, residing at No. 190, Shangwen Road in the Chinese district, with his office located at No. 11, Fenghuang Lane, Huo Fei Road in the French Concession. Tao Saibao, a local resident, previously entrusted Lawyer Zhu to handle the assessment and sale of land located near Yangshupu in East Shanghai. As a result, it was discovered that Zhu had breached his trust by underreporting the sale price by about 5,000 yuan. Because the negotiations were unresolved, Tao hired lawyer Chen Zemin to represent him and filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing him of breach of trust. The court accepted the lawsuit, and Judge Li Changnian opened a court hearing to summon the defendant Zhu Lanjia. Zhu Lanjia hired lawyers Shan Yihua and Zhu Dianqing to defend him and filed a counterclaim. Later, because the summoned witnesses did not arrive, the court ordered repeated postponements, and the case remained unresolved for more than a month. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Li summoned the case to continue the hearing in the Criminal Court. According to lawyer Chen Zemin, the agent of the plaintiff, the case has been settled out of court, and requested permission to withdraw the lawsuit. The defendant also stated that the case has been settled and requested permission to withdraw the counterclaim. The court verified the statements and then announced permission for both parties to withdraw the lawsuit, and the case documents were returned to both parties in court for them to take and leave the court.</p>
<h3>Two Prisoners Escaped</h3>
<p>Each Sentenced to Two Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Zhang Huicai, Zhao Yunzu, and Liu Agui, all natives of Ningbo, were previously arrested in the French Concession for robbery and sent to the Second Special District Court by the French Police Station for prosecution. After the trial, they were sentenced to imprisonment and sent to the Second Special Prison for execution. Unexpectedly, the three prisoners colluded and used strips torn from their clothes to make ropes. At about 3:00 AM on September 9th of this year, when the prison cell was opened, Zhang and Zhao forced Liu to climb over the wall with the rope first, and then helped them escape. Unexpectedly, Liu was anxious and clumsy and fell from the wall and was injured. The guards and police discovered the escape and confined the three prisoners in separate rooms. Liu died due to his injuries after being sent to the hospital for treatment. When Zhang and Zhao were transferred to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special Court for investigation, they claimed that they were beaten and injured by Director Wang Baochang and requested permission to file a complaint. After the prosecutor summoned Wang for investigation, he filed a public prosecution for all charges. This case has been reported in previous newspapers. The case has been repeatedly opened for trial by Criminal Court Judge Wang Gangxu and declared closed. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang sentenced Zhang Huicai and Zhao Yunzu to two years of imprisonment each for attempted escape. Wang Baochang was found not guilty of causing injury. After the sentencing, Zhang and Zhao were sent back to prison for execution.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Involving Public Bonds Used as Collateral for Provisional Attachment</h3>
<p>The Second Special District Court Opened an Investigation Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Qu Jisheng, the owner of Zida Lumber Company, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court last year, represented by lawyer Bian Jialu, against Wang Xiankang, the owner of Changtai Lumber Company, for failing to pay a debt of more than 25,000 yuan. After the judgment was confirmed, the execution court executed it. Qu applied for a provisional attachment of the defendant's property. The execution court judge Yang Ding ruled that Qu should provide a guarantee of 12,000 yuan. Qu managed to borrow twelve long-term financial public bonds, each with a face value of 1,000 yuan, totaling 12,000 yuan. On January 22nd of this year, he handed them over to lawyer Bian to submit to the court and then implemented the attachment of the defendant's property. After the execution office of the court received the public bonds, it transferred them to the accounting department of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for safekeeping. When the case ended, Qu Jisheng requested the return of the public bonds used as collateral. The court designated a date and issued them on October 2nd of this year. Qu first went to the Second Special Court to obtain a return certificate and then went to the accounting department of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court on West Aiham Road to collect the public bonds. When he collected the public bonds, he discovered that twelve interest coupons dated September 30th, totaling 150 yuan, had been torn off. He immediately negotiated, but to no avail. Because Qu had stated on the application when submitting the public bonds that the public bonds were submitted together with the number of interest coupons, and the bonds were borrowed from his friend Song Benren of Rui Da Lumber Company, he had to be responsible for compensating for the loss of interest coupons and was unwilling to accept it. He immediately filed a lawsuit with the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special Court, accusing the duty clerk of the fee collection office of the court and requesting an investigation. The Prosecutor's Office accepted the lawsuit. Yesterday, the court summoned the clerks of the fee collection office of the accounting department of the Third Branch of the High Court, the clerks of the receiving and dispatching office and the execution office of the Second Special Court, the plaintiff Qu Jisheng, and the witnesses Song Benren and lawyer Bian Jialu to court. At 2:30 PM, Prosecutor Wang Ren and Clerk Peng Xiang specially opened the Fifth Court for investigation and questioned them one by one. It ended at 4:30 PM, and they were ordered to leave and await further review.</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Tropical Medicine Association of Annam Visit Various Factories</h3>
<p>Banquet Hosted Last Night for Representatives of Various Factories</p>
<p>Dr. Zhao Ren Pan Wenxian, a representative attending the Ninth Far Eastern Tropical Medicine Association in Nanjing, visited North China and Japan after the meeting. Recently, he returned to Shanghai to investigate the local industrial situation. Upon arriving in Shanghai, he asked his old friends Liang Boxi of Liang Xinji and Xie Guoying, a consultant of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, to introduce him to visit major factories in Shanghai. In recent days, he has visited dozens of factories, such as Ran Xinji Toothbrush Factory, Tianchu MSG Factory, Meiya Wire Mesh Factory, Guanshengyuan Food Factory, Guangshenghang Cosmetics Factory, Kangyuan Canning Factory, Xinya Tea Factory, Yong'an Spinning Factory, Dachunghua Celluloid Factory, Shengde Lace Factory, Livestock Milk Factory, and Minsheng Chicken Farm. Pan was warmly received at each factory. The explanations of various products were extremely detailed. Pan's impressions of this visit were excellent. However, as he was about to return to Annam, he hosted a banquet last night (the 15th) on the third floor of Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road, inviting representatives of various factories to celebrate, describe his impressions of this trip, and express his gratitude. Dozens of manufacturers attended that evening. Because Pan did not speak Chinese, Liang and Xie translated the conversation. During the banquet, Liang Boxi, at the direction of Dr. Pan, stood up to give a speech, saying that Wenxian came to China to chair the Ninth Tropical Medicine Association and had the opportunity to witness everything in your country, which he thought was very satisfactory. Many people from your country are engaged in industry and commerce in our country, and they are very friendly to each other on weekdays. People from our country also enjoy using goods from your country. There is much to see in the trade between China and Vietnam. In recent days, Liang and Xie have taken him to visit major factories here, and he felt that all kinds of products can be improved, beautiful and durable, and the people in charge of the factories are also very friendly and sincere. What is admirable is not only that. He had traveled along the Jinpu Railway to Pingjin last month and had seen the situation along the way and contacted people from all over your country, and he only saw that they were polite, honest, and simple, which could be used as a mirror for the people of our country. Now that our country and your country are in a state of no treaty because the Sino-French Vietnam Treaty has expired, he hopes that the treaty can be signed as soon as possible so that commodity trade between the two countries can return to its original state. In short, his impression of this trip to China is all good. After returning home in the future, he plans to write a book about his travels in China so that people in his country can have a full understanding of the situation in your country. After the speech, Xiang Kangyuan of Kangyuan Factory gave a reply, elaborating on the way of mutual love and mutual assistance between the two countries. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until about 10 o'clock and then dispersed.</p>

<p>The relationship between the central and local governments is a fundamental issue in China. China is not yet fully unified, and the power of the central government is insufficient. Since the founding of the Republic, there have been more than twenty years of internal strife. Military personnel have used martial law everywhere, controlling local areas and refusing to obey the central government, focusing only on their own organizations and conflicting with the central government. The history of the Republic has been marked by these facts. The current constitution includes a chapter on the relationship between the central and local governments, with the aim of completely unifying China and preventing it from being controlled by military personnel again.</p>
<p>The so-called "provinces" in China are different from the "states" in European countries or the "states" in the United States. The United States initially consisted of thirteen states, which were British colonies. They later rebelled against Britain and became independent countries. It can be seen that historically, states existed before the nation. Germany is similar; it was formed by uniting several states in recent decades. Historically, "states" existed before the country. These "states" were small countries. The United States became the United States of America because of its circumstances and history. Germany is similar. However, China is different. China had a nation before it had provinces. The provinces were created by dividing the nation. This system has been the central government's administrative division for hundreds of years and is controlled by the central government. Foreign countries call this organization "clnspect." Local governments are only representatives of the central government to carry out local politics and cannot be independent.</p>
<p>Chinese history, since the unification by Qin Shi Huang and the abolition of the feudal system, has been completely unified for over two thousand years. Therefore, Chinese provinces are different from foreign federations. We should have a clear understanding of the status of provinces based on history. They are not independent but are administrative divisions of the central government. The central government is the superior authority of the provinces, and the provinces cannot separate from the central government. Without the central government, there would be no provinces. Our constitution allows local people to organize themselves, elect provincial governors, and elect provincial assemblies. The central government has direct control over the provinces. The central government issues orders to the provinces, and the provinces receive the orders and implement central laws and policies. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Hongying Library Actively Preparing to Build New Building</h3>
<p>Address Decided: Baseball Field on Rue du Pere Robert</p>
<p>Original Plan for Trial Opening Abandoned</p>
<p>Since the destruction of the Oriental Library in the January 28th Incident, there has been no large library in the city for people to read. The Hongying Library, which is currently under preparation, is large in scale and has an adequate collection of books, making it the best among the city's libraries. Details of the library's preparation are as follows:</p>
<h3>Large Scale and Adequate Collection of Books</h3>
<p>The library was established by industrialist Mr. Ye Hongying, who donated 400,000 yuan and accepted the books of the Renwen Library. The planned scale is quite large, and the current collection has reached more than 50,000 volumes, with an even more adequate collection of historical materials. Since the establishment of the preparatory office on Avenue Joffre and the start of work, the cataloging work is nearing completion. The collection of books is continuing, and donations of books from all sectors are welcome.</p>
<h3>Trial Opening Difficult to Realize</h3>
<p>The library was originally scheduled to open on a trial basis this autumn in the preparatory office for people from all walks of life to read, but was postponed to the winter due to insufficient preparation. It has now been learned that the library's board of directors has decided to cancel the trial opening plan because the current collection of books is not yet adequate. The library will be officially opened after the new building is constructed.</p>
<h3>Construction of New Building to Be Completed Next Year</h3>
<p>The library's building plan has been delayed due to the difficulty in finding an address. It has now been decided to lease five acres of vacant land on the Rue du Pere Robert baseball field to build the library. The land was donated to Mr. Yan Fuqing, President of the National Shanghai Medical College, by the Rockefeller Foundation. Mr. Yan has built the Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital and has much land left over, so he has agreed to lease it to the library. Construction will begin within the year, with the aim of completing it next year.</p>

<p>Registration for the this week's athletic meet at Daxia starts. The Chinese Single Item Athletics Competition Promotion Association, which previously sponsored the city-wide long-distance running championship, had generals such as Wang Zhenglin and Jin Zhongkang participate, which made ordinary athletes shy away.

<p>He likes her, and I guarantee he won't spend much money. If he doesn't like her, coming here, he only needs to buy a pack of cigarettes and treat the guests. There's no reason to refuse that, right? Li Shilian said, "You're meeting him for the first time. If you introduce this matter, I'm afraid he'll be a little embarrassed. It's better to meet at my place. People will think they're coming to see me. If he's willing, he'll take the bait. If he's not willing, it has nothing to do with him." Guo Dunpin said, "But you also have to make an appointment with him. If you don't make an appointment with him and I bring the person over, and he's not at Little Western Paradise, it doesn't matter to me, but the person I bring won't want to come a second time." Li Shilian said, "Okay, I'll write a note to notify him first." So he spread out paper, brush, ink, and inkstone on the table, wrote a note, and gave it to the tea boy to deliver to Jia Duocai's room. Since seeing Zhu Yueying last night, this Mr. Jia felt that everything in the world was about fate. Why would he meet her again in Xi'an? This wasn't an ordinary encounter and was worth paying attention to. He thought this in his heart and began planning the method of proceeding. At this time, Li Shilian wrote a note, which was very much to his liking. The note read:</p>
<p>Brother Duocai: Your brother already knows what's on your mind. Please come to your brother's room at seven o'clock this afternoon. Looking at a beauty under the lamp, how wonderful, how wonderful! What do you say? I'm not saying everything, and I wish you well. Furthermore, this matter is a matter of friendship and does not involve any expenses. Knowing that you are concerned, I am informing you of this, and please be sure to come on time. I hope and pray. Your brother, Shilian, bows.</p>
<p>Duocai didn't bother to scrutinize the wording of the note, but he understood it very well in his heart. He knew that Shilian had made an appointment with that girl to meet in his room. He had also contacted that girl. However, he wouldn't have made an appointment to meet at seven o'clock unless he was very sure. Since he had received the note, he would go on time. (65)</p>
<h3>Passing Through Yuanqing Garden</h3>
<p>— Fei Ma</p>
<p>Last year, when I was staying in Hangzhou, I often went to West Lake with my second uncle. My second uncle said he didn't like swimming, only mountain climbing, so we always went to Gushan to drink. One time we both got drunk, and my second uncle suddenly said excitedly, "Today is the eighth day of the fourth month, the incense at Lingyin Temple will be very strong. Let's go have some fun!" So, we took our slight drunkenness and walked slowly along a long path.</p>
<p>The trees along the road in the spring were lush and lovely, and the warm sunlight shone on everything. As we approached a low wall surrounded by vines, my second uncle pointed to the woods and said, "The tomb of the painter Tao Yuanqing is just ahead." I immediately looked up and saw the three characters "Yuanqing Garden" written vertically on the small gate.</p>
<p>I went inside with my second uncle.</p>
<p>The style of the tomb inside was very novel, like a marble grandfather clock, with only four Roman numerals engraved on it indicating the year of the funeral. A small pond was dug in the opposite corner, and there was nothing else. I saw these words written in pencil on the tombstone: "Brother, I came to see you today. Rest in peace!" I thought to myself that these words must have been written by his sister, Tao Sijin.</p>
<p>My second uncle said to me, "This Yuanqing Garden was built for him by Xu Qinwen, an old friend who liked to write novels, by borrowing money." He suddenly asked me with a smile, "Do you remember the news of a tragic murder case in Hangzhou a few years ago?"</p>
<p>"I remember!" I nodded. He then told me, "Now Xu Qinwen and Tao Sijin are both in prison. Tao Sijin has been sentenced to life imprisonment." He gave me an old man's ironic smile.</p>
<p>At this time, my second uncle and I had already walked out of Yuanqing Garden and unknowingly left it dozens of steps away. Looking back, I saw the tomb being embraced by a semi-circular low wall in the woods.</p>
<p>I thought blankly that the sister who wrote on the tombstone was now unfortunately imprisoned, perhaps never to be able to visit his lonely tomb again?</p>
<h3>Taizhou Lanterns</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>Since new-style masthead lights and flashlights have replaced the position of paper lanterns, paper lanterns in society are like fallen leaves blown by the autumn wind, forever confined to the cold palace, with no chance to rise again. However, in poor and remote areas, the charm of paper lanterns still lurks, flickering in the corners of the countryside. In the era of the 20th century, paper lanterns are still welcomed by some people in small cities, just like preserving antiques.</p>
<p>In the decades when paper lanterns were at their most prominent, Taizhou lanterns were the most exquisite and delicate in the counties north of the Yangtze River. These lanterns use bamboo strips as the frame, and white silk-like gauze as the covering, with various patterns cut from colored paper pasted on them, and then lightly coated with tung oil. After drying, they are lit with wax candles to provide light, which has a different charm compared to today's electric lights. During the most popular period of Taizhou lanterns, there were about several thousand people engaged in this livelihood. The footprints of these lanterns almost covered the counties north and south of the Yangtze River. Today, when we talk about the anecdotes of handicrafts north of the Yangtze River, we still praise this matter unabated.</p>
<p>Regarding the story of Taizhou lanterns, I still remember that twenty years ago, there was a woman named Wang in Xinghua, whose fiancé worked in a Taizhou shop. The woman was critically ill with lung disease and knew that her life was unavoidable. She pleaded with her brother to go to Taizhou to ask her fiancé for an object to show her devotion and prepare for her burial. Her brother could not bear to refuse her request, so he obeyed and went. At that time, there were no steamers. The long journey from Xinghua to Taizhou, more than a hundred miles, was only possible by relying on civilian boats. When her brother arrived in Taizhou, it happened that her fiancé had gone elsewhere to handle goods. Her brother had no choice but to buy a Taizhou lantern and return, to strengthen his sister's faith.</p>
<p>The woman saw a silk lantern on her sickbed, and heard what her brother told her. She took it and placed it beside her until she died of illness, holding the lantern without letting go. After her death, her mother and brother took it as a burial object, because of the woman's sincerity, regarding the lantern as a gift from her fiancé. Alive, she was a member of a certain family; dead, she would be a ghost of a certain family. The woman saw the lantern with a special kind of pure intention. This sad and touching story is still lamented by people when they talk about it.</p>
<h3>Forever Following It</h3>
<h3>Butterfly Loves Flowers</h3>

<p>Feeling in a Desolate Village, using Mr. Wang Jingwei's rhyme when he went to Liaodong.</p>
<p>Rain and wind slant in the desolate desert. The reeds are white. The cultivated land is red. The ancient trees are dim and the crows are about to fall. People scatter tears of hunger and cold. The traveler is gone, busy with the fortress. The woman's head is disheveled. Every heart is broken. A hundred years or so, death is the end. What is most feared is the outbreak of war.</p>

<h3>Records of Fragrant Shadows</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>On the ceiling, there were also many decorations such as flying dragons and phoenixes, also made of pure gold. And these pillars and the ceiling itself, needless to say, were of course made of the most precious wood. Here, however, only common wood was used, and there was not a single piece of real gold decoration! Furthermore, in the summer palace in Rehe, all the door locks on the doors, and those window hooks, were mostly made of silver, or if not silver, they must be of the best red copper or white copper. But here, only ordinary brass and white iron were seen. In short, from a material point of view, no matter which point you compare, the summer palace in Rehe was indeed much richer and more magnificent than the ancient palace in Shengjing!</p>
<p>The reason why the palace in Shengjing could not be decorated to the fullest extent was very simple, in a word, lack of financial resources. Although the market in the three eastern provinces was not very desolate, and the people had not experienced any famine, the people here had always been accustomed to a very simple life. Everyone did not pay attention to extravagance and luxury, and the money and grain collected by the government were also relatively small. Therefore, in the eyes of the local people, these palaces were already very luxurious and exquisite, and they did not feel the need for renovation. On the part of the government, it was also limited by economic strength, and simply held the same mentality as the people, allowing these old buildings to maintain their original state forever. In fact, in all fairness, houses like these were indeed very suitable for serving as a temporary palace for the emperor or empress dowager to visit occasionally. All of us had lost our spirit of enduring hardship after living a comfortable life for several generations in Guannei, and we had also developed a very extravagant habit. We could not help but look down on ordinary objects, and thus saw these old palaces, which still retained some ancient charm, as lacking splendor everywhere. (175)</p>

<h3>Explanation of Qi Cultivation</h3>
<p>— Chen Shicheng</p>
<p>Previously, Zhang Xuebin came to Shanghai to set up a challenge arena, boasting of his so-called Plum Blossom Pile, Golden Bell Cover, Iron Shirt and other skills. Those poisoned by martial arts novels were all excited, thinking that they could finally witness the sword immortals and heroes in their ideals. Some also wrote to the National Martial Arts Hall to inquire whether the skills of the Golden Bell Cover and Iron Shirt really existed. It can be said that it caused a sensation for a while.</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Mu once questioned me about this matter. I replied that the Plum Blossom Pile is a unique skill. My friend Mr. Deng, whose teacher Mr. Cai from Guangdong, also made a name for himself with this skill, but unfortunately he returned to Guangdong a few years ago. He said: What about the Golden Bell Cover and Iron Shirt? I said: These are internal skills of the Shaolin School. Although they involve tempering muscles and bones, they do not go beyond the scope of Qi cultivation. Mr. Mu suddenly said: I have practiced martial arts for more than ten years, and have a slight understanding of the inner and outer schools. Although I have repeatedly heard the theory of Qi cultivation from my teacher, I still do not know what Qi really is. Does it refer to the breath of breathing? Or does it refer to something else? When I asked my teacher, he vaguely refused to tell me the truth. Can you tell me about it?</p>
<p>I smiled and said: The scope of the word "Qi" is extremely broad. It is not that your teacher is unwilling to tell you, but that it is difficult to explain. Medical scholars have the saying of Qi deficiency and Qi excess. Articles have the distinction between strong and weak Qi. Martial arts practitioners say that "strength" must be accompanied by the word "Qi", so they do not say "strength", but "Qi strength". In this regard, it is no longer what air so-called includes, moreover the meaning of the word Qi has not been exhausted here!</p>
<p>He said: Then what is the "Qi" you are talking about? I said: This is not something that can be fully explained in a quick conversation! Roughly speaking, it can be divided into four types: (A) Breathing Qi (B) Defensive Qi (C) True Yuan Qi (D) True One Qi. True One Qi was invented by Taoists, and only Taoists have mastered its secrets. Its principle is mysterious and subtle, and cannot be fully explained. It is also not known to martial arts practitioners, so let's not discuss it for the time being. What martial arts practitioners cultivate are only the first three types: A, B, and C. Now I will discuss them separately as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Breathing Qi The so-called breathing Qi is air: it contains oxygen. It is inhaled through the nose and reaches the lungs. After the blood goes through a large circulation, its color changes to purple, and it returns to the atrium. After the lungs circulate the blood, the fresh air in the lungs cleans it, removes its dirt, and its color returns to red, and it returns to the atrium. The oxygen in the lungs combines with the carbon in the blood to form carbon dioxide (coz); and it is exhaled from the mouth and nose. People can go without food for several days, but cannot stop breathing for a moment, this is the reason. When people are engaged in strenuous exercise, the flow of blood must be accelerated compared to normal times; therefore, the heart and lungs swell, breathing becomes rapid, and Qi is blocked and cannot be released. Therefore, martial arts practitioners must empty their hearts, fill their abdomen, and sink their Qi, so that the diaphragm sinks down and expands the lungs, so that they will not pant for breath after a long fight. This is the initial work of Qi cultivation, and it is also emphasized by external martial arts.</p>
<p>(B) Defensive Qi This is what Chinese medicine calls the Qi of the Taiyang Cold Water. The Inner Canon uses the Sanjiao as the official who decides the dredging. Later doctors mostly do not know what the Sanjiao is. Jiao was originally written as Qiao, which is the omentum connected to the fat membrane of the human body. When a person drinks water and it enters the stomach, the stomach has fine capillaries that disperse the water, which travels through the omentum and enters the bladder. The part that is not completely dispersed reaches the lower abdomen, where there are also fine capillaries that disperse the water and travel through the lower Jiao to enter the bladder. The upper opening of the bladder is in the omentum of the lower Jiao. These are all downward-flowing water, which has not yet been transformed into Qi. The heart and lungs are connected. The inhaled Qi passes from the lungs through the heart, drawing the heart fire along the spine into the kidney system. From the kidney system it enters the omentum and is distributed to the small intestine. The water in the omentum is all steamed and transformed into Qi. The water that is not completely transformed seeps into the bladder. The bottom of the bladder is the Qi Sea, also known as the Blood Chamber, which is a large compartment in the omentum. Taoists call it the Dantian, and doctors call it the Baozhong. The heart fire enters the kidney system, goes straight to the omentum and reaches the Blood Chamber, steaming the water in the bladder, all of which is transformed into Qi, which penetrates out of the Qi Sea, travels along the omentum to the chest and diaphragm and reaches the throat. The Qi that spreads in all directions from the omentum travels through the muscles and comes out of the skin and hair, which is the Defensive Qi. Doctors collectively call the small intestine and bladder the Taiyang meridian for this reason.</p>
<p>(C) True Yuan Qi This is the Yuan Qi in the Gate of Life. The Gate of Life is located in the middle of the two kidneys. It is the main acupoint of the Du meridian, and the root of life. People receive this Qi to have life, and when the Qi is exhausted, they die. The work of transporting Qi is based on this and uses the Dantian as the place of action. The heart fire enters the kidney water, combines with the True Qi of the Gate of Life, and flows down to the Baozhong. When the Qi in the Baozhong is full, the waist and abdomen become hot and the Ren and Du meridians open naturally. Then it can reach the Niwan (the brain) and communicate with the Yongquan (in the center of the sole). The work of transporting Qi is completed at this point. However, the reason why this Qi can travel to the skin and hair, reach the limbs, and reach every detail, is entirely due to the function of the Couli of the Sanjiao. Couli is the membrane of the fat meat inside and the lean meat outside, which has the same root as the Sanjiao, and is actually the same thing with different names, so it can communicate with each other and travel smoothly without obstruction. The Qi cultivation of the national guards is roughly like this. As for the tempering methods, I have already explained them in my book "Guiding, Nourishing Life, and Defending the Middle Tone", so I will not repeat them here. After Mr. Mu retreated, he wrote this down with a wet brush, to correct the ambitions of the wise.</p>

<h3>Financial Swap Unfavorable, Many Local Shocks, Bid Price Falls Back Five Yuan Nine Jiao</h3>
<p>Swap Buyers Bid Higher and Higher</p>
<p>The Final Market State Gradually Softens</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a contraction in both the silver market exchange rate and pure gold, while Shanghai was extremely firm. After pressure, the foreign exchange market was tight and then loosened, and a pullback was seen. Finally, the swap premium was unfavorable to the buyers, and the multiple parties shook. As a result, it was particularly weak. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US contracted, and the forward silver market continued to fall back, with the exchange rate falling consistently. London pure gold rose by three pence, and the market sentiment was still optimistic. The preliminary transaction opened, rising to over eighty yuan, and the buying interest was quite strong and continued to rise. The Central Bank's posted price was announced, the British price remained flat, and the US price contracted by 0.0625. The Customs Gold Unit rose by three li, and the bid price standard was increased to 1003 yuan. The market sentiment was particularly optimistic. The morning opened high, but because large holders rushed to sell at high prices, the buyers temporarily waited and watched, and fell back after the opening. The banks' appetite was still strong, and Chinese merchants also had buying appetite. The exchange rate tightened, and the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's posted price was announced, with the British price remaining flat and the US price contracting by 0.125. At this time, the buying interest was booming, and it once rose again, but because the banks took the opportunity to dump their holdings, and the sellers in the market were quite active, it gradually fell back. The White Silver Balance Tax was announced, still at 8.25 percent, calculated at one shilling and five and a half pence. At this time, because Sassoon and the Central Bank were still strong, it was still able to rise after falling, but the exchange rate had hardened, and Chinese merchants had no buying appetite, and finally retreated into eighty yuan, circling and falling. Although there was a flow of people taking advantage of the low price to buy strips, the swap pre-doing was posted by the buyers by one or two yuan, and the bulls were very willing to post, although it rose, it still fell, and the domestic market continued to harden. Finally, there were not many transactions, the economic situation was still stable, and the market situation was also stable, and it was hovering. The market was very stable in the later market, but it did not cross the eighty yuan mark. The banks and Sassoon provided some supply, and it gradually fell, but the market sentiment was still stable, and it was able to maintain. The initial report of Indian silver came with a decrease of twelve. twelve. eleven anna, and recovered after the low. However, the shorts were strongly positioned, and the buyers continued to be frightened, resulting in a higher swap premium.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange experienced relatively slight fluctuations. However, it was also very minor. The market sentiment was uncertain. Both the bulls and bears seemed to be waiting for an opportunity to move. Although the trend is currently not easy to break the deadlock, there are not many trading days left this month. There are still many bulls and bears, and they cannot remain in this stalemate for long. If the situation wavers slightly, the waves may immediately arrive. Yesterday's market situation was more of a decline in the morning two rounds, because the Central Political Council discussed the North China case, and people were uncertain about the reason, and slightly rose fear and suspicion. The number four bulls slightly sold out, and various gangs also came out of the cage one after another. The market slightly rose a decline.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Are Bland, Color Isn't a Metric of Yarn</h3>

<h3>Second Estimate of Cotton Production Announced</h3>
<p>- Increased Compared to the First Time -</p>
<p>The China Cotton Industry Statistics Association announced the second estimate of the national cotton production in the 23rd year at 5:00 pm on November 15, 23rd year as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Field Area 44,805,79 mu, Seed Cotton Production 11,172,553 dan, Abandoned Field Area 441,370 mu</p>
<p>The above estimate is based on the reports of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other eleven provinces and Shanghai and Tianjin, two cities. Two, the status of cotton production before November 10 is the standard. Third, the losses suffered by cotton crops in various provinces before November 10 are included. Fourth, cotton fields are in Chinese mu as the unit, and cotton production is in dan (100 jin per dan) as the unit.</p>
<p>The comparison of the number of estimates published each year in the past three years of the annual cotton field production of the two estimates of this year’s conference is below.</p>
<p>National cotton fields have made progress every year. In the twenty-second year, from 30 million mu, we advanced to 40 million mu. If society is stable, the cotton planting industry will continue to work hard. An area of 44 million mu will be gradually expanded. This year's summer drought has spread throughout the country, and cotton plants have generally failed to develop properly. In the north, autumn rain continues, and cotton harvesting is delayed by two weeks. Frost is also dry, and only half of the flowers are harvested before frost. After frost, the quality of cotton harvested is inevitably slightly worse. During the harvesting period, there are often many overcast and rainy days. The long-staple cotton area has suffered even greater losses, which is very regrettable. The Yangtze River Basin is in the same severe drought. After the autumn rains, they are either too much or too late to benefit the cotton harvest. Jiangxi has been in severe drought throughout, and the cotton harvest is also poor. The national cotton crop this year can be said to have been completely affected by the drought. However, since the area of cotton fields this year, excluding abandoned fields, is still 10% higher than last year, if the weather is in harmony, the production will definitely be more than this number. The comparison between this estimate and the first estimate and last year's final revised estimate is as follows:</p>
<p>Compared to the first estimate in the 23rd year</p>
<p>Cotton Field Increase 366,532 mu, Increase 0.82%, Seed Cotton Increase 674,629 dan, Increase 6.40%</p>
<p>Compared to the final revised estimate in the 22nd year</p>
<p>Cotton Field Increase 4,353,556 mu, Increase 10.74%, Seed Cotton Increase 1,398,346 dan, Increase 14.32%</p>
<p>The average yield per mu is 24.9 jin, an increase of 1.4 jin compared to the first estimate of 23.5 jin, and an increase of 0.7 jin compared to 24.2 jin in the twenty-second year.</p>
<p>This estimate has an item for "abandoned fields", which refers to cotton fields that were indeed planted and sprouted, but later, due to special circumstances, were either flooded or withered due to severe drought, and were completely abandoned without any harvest.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Falls by Ten Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton lacked buyers. The bulls settled and the South sold, and the market was tired. Spot goods fell by ten pounds, futures fell by seven to ten pounds, British cotton futures fell by four points, and Indian cotton was suspended. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 14th).</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Weak Grain and Flour Markets</h3>
<p>- Imported Wheat Reports Small...Bulls Sell Off...Northern Sales Decrease -</p>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the prices of various months generally showed a soft trend. The quotations of imported wheat in both Chicago and Canada fell by about 1.5 jiao. When the price was opened, the current month saw a small face due to non-industry bulls eager to sell. The prices of each month in the long-term were also mutually entered and exited by non-industry bulls. Although there were no transactions of current imported wheat, the price was still close to the actual situation. Therefore, there were many who returned. The new speculators also found the purchase very smooth, causing each month's situation to be slightly soft. When the market returned in the afternoon, the transactions in each month were not smooth, and the market price also showed a hovering trend. In the current situation, after the Northeast added taxes, the sales path will naturally decrease. Although the price of rice in the park has been steadily rising, although flour is one of the food grains, it is necessary to see how the actual sales change. As a result, this month was 7.5 li smaller, December was 7.5 li smaller, January was 1.25 li smaller, March was 5 li smaller, March was 2.5 li smaller, and April was 7.5 li smaller, it is said.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, the market in each month generally showed a lonely hovering trend. The quotations of foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada were slightly smaller by about 1.5 jiao. When the price was opened, people's hearts were stable, and there were few entries and exits. There was very little competition between each month due to acceptance and observation, so the market atmosphere was unusually stable. When the market opened in the afternoon, because the flour market also turned stable, the buying atmosphere was also flat. The opening of each month was similar to the morning. After observation, if the foreign wheat continued to be stable, there might be a slight drop, otherwise it should be seen as stable. As a result, this month was one fen smaller, December and January were unchanged, February was one fen better. After the current wheat market was mutually rejected for a few days, it was 2 fen better due to good factory demand, opening Shandong Guide wheat at 3 yuan 9 jiao 2 fen, estimating 5,000 packages of yuan were opened.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat profit-takers sold off in large quantities. The market suction was still good. Apart from that, the market was flat and there was not much pressure.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat November 13 closing November 14 closing rise and fall December</p>
<h3>Late Rice Arrives Sparsely and Continues to Rise by Several Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The sources of each gang are slightly more, a total of more than 40 numbers (a total of more than 6,000 shi of goods). There is a lot of thick japonica rice, and the late rice is truly limited. Although the sales path of late rice is flat, the package-stomachs are Qingdao lightly handles about 300 packages, adding up to a light of more than 1 or 2 jiao. Since there is more thick japonica rice arriving, and the stomachs are also limited, the market attitude is currently soft. Although the sellers are trying to hold on, the market price has not risen much. The aftermarket may lack beauty. The price of Du Yang Tip has been stable. The yin yuan is continuing to be moved by the liquor households. Then the show is strange, and the change yuan is still not available.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about 30 numbers of sources from various places in Hexia. The market's sales of each goods, new japonica early thin rice new sheep Du Tip consumed normally in the early market. The aftermarket was slightly better, and the zero dismantling of Chen Baiyuan and Yin Yuan were still frequent. The liquor households continued to move, but there was no Hexia goods. New and Chen Bu guest tips were slightly traded. The market shape of new japonica high goods was rising, and the middle and secondary prices were close to the corner. The price of new sheep Du Tip and new Chen Bu guest tips was stable. The thin rice and early rice were slightly soft. The Chen Baiyuan and Yin Yuan continued to rise upwards.</p>

<h3>On the Use of Allusions</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jiping</p>
<p>Scholars often have the habit of showing off their learning, liking to use allusions. Like the story of the scholar buying a donkey, where the sales contract of three pages did not contain the word "donkey." It must have used many pronouns, such as words like "Big-Eared Public," which is utterly laughable. Allusions are also frequently used in composing lyrics, making the phrases very beautiful, but in reality, they are empty and devoid of substance, like the plum blossom lyrics of the Song Dynasty lyricist Jiang Kui:</p>
<p>[Mossy branches bear jade-like blossoms, where tiny green birds roost together on the branches. We meet again in a traveler's plight, by the fence corner at dusk, silently leaning on slender bamboos. Zhaojun is unaccustomed to the distant desert sands, only remembering the Jiangnan region. Imagining her jade pendants jingling as she returns by moonlight, transformed into this lonely flower. Still remembering past events in the deep palace, that person is sleeping, a moth-green hue flitting near. Do not be like the spring breeze, disregarding her gracefulness, hastily arranging a golden house for her. Still letting a petal float away with the waves, yet complaining about the jade dragon's mournful tune. Waiting until then to seek its hidden fragrance, it has already entered a small window frame.]</p>
<p>This is a very famous lyric by Jiang Kui. If we didn't see the title, we wouldn't know what he was writing about. Inside, there are "green birds," "slender bamboos," "Zhaojun," "desert sands," "deep palace," "golden house," truly not knowing what relationship they have to the plum blossom. This lyric is truly like "a seven-treasure tower, broken down into fragments." From this, we can see that scholars have a habit of using allusions.</p>
<p>There are many stories about ancient people liking to use allusions. Now, let's cite two examples. "Crane Jade Dew" records:</p>
<p>[When Liu Yuxi was composing on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month, he wanted to use the word "cake," but because it was not commonly seen, he ultimately dared not use it. Therefore, Song Zijing's poem says: "Liu Lang dares not write the word 'cake,' falsely bearing a lifetime of poetic talent." However, Bai Letian's poem says: "Moved the seat to the chrysanthemum bushes, cakes and wine arrayed before me." So he had already used it. When Liu and Bai were composing in harmony, I wonder if they ever talked about this?]</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the restrictions on ancient people composing poetry were numerous. Often, there were many opinions they dared not express. Even for a single word that was not commonly seen, they dared not use it. The reason why Bai Letian's poetry surpassed Liu Yuxi's was precisely because of this.</p>
<p>There are also those who use allusions and become the laughingstock. Song Zhuang Jiyu's "Chicken Rib Compilation" records:</p>
<p>[Wang Yishao loved geese, Cao Mengde had the story of the plum forest quenching thirst, but common people called geese "Right General" and plums "Duke Cao." Earlier people had already recorded in letters: "Braised one Right General, honey-soaked two jars of Duke Cao," taking it as a joke. Zhang Yuanyu said: Deng Yongjiang had a note inviting Qu saying, "Today, there happens to be a favor from Left General, I have ordered noodles to be prepared, please come and enjoy it together." Initially not knowing what Left General was, after eating, it turned out to be duck. Asked about the origin of the name, it was below the goose, and this saying existed in the Huai Right region. Deng became an official and waited to govern Jingzhou, the son of Xun Wu's pivot. Common people, because Mount Tai has the Father-in-law Peak, then called the mother of their wife "Tai Water," which can be paired with Left General.]</p>
<p>Reading this passage of notes, one cannot help but laugh heartily, for there is no improper use of allusions greater than this. Whether in poetry, lyrics, or essays, all are expressions of one's own opinions. With opinions, there is abundant emotion. When emotions are strong, even someone with a little literary cultivation can write very moving essays or poems. Su Dongpo said that his own writing was like ten thousand hu of spring water, which could emerge anywhere. Flowing torrentially on flat ground, it was easy to travel a thousand miles in a day. But when it encountered famous mountains and twists and turns, it changed shape with the object and became unknowable, always going where it should go, always stopping where it cannot but stop. In this way, simply writing it out as it comes, without forcing it at all, there is naturally a kind of charm. If there are no opinions, no emotions, only recording the allusions of ancient people, one is just a stupid ox and will never be brilliant. Furthermore, lyrics can be called art because they are concise in language and have lasting meaning, like the five-character quatrain of old poetry, with only twenty characters in total. One must express various emotions within these twenty characters. Even when writing scenery, one must be ingenious and give people a very deep impression. Let's give two very common examples: Meng Haoran's "The wilderness is vast, the sky lowers to the trees, the river is clear, the moon is close to people." These two lines of scenery are not ordinary sentences. Why didn't he use "The wilderness is vast, the trees are tall, the sky, the river is clear, the moon shines on people"? This is because that way of writing is more intimate and can give people a deep impression. The difference between a "close" character and a "shine" character is truly vast. This is the art of using words, not using allusions. Also, like Li Shangyin's "The sunset is infinitely good, only it is near dusk," anyone who has seen the sunset can probably imagine it with their eyes closed. This is so readily available, so ordinary, but for thousands of years, no one has said this sentence, only Li Shangyin alone. These two lines of poetry have become famous lines passed down by everyone. In fact, on the surface, they are just ten extremely ordinary characters that everyone can write, but we have not written them. This is real poetry, real art. Otherwise, if a five-character quatrain has only twenty characters, with ten allusions, it can make up a hundred poems, what difficulty is there? A true work of art is heavenly music. Heavenly music is very natural and is definitely not pieced together and decorated with old things. Decorated things are definitely not art. Suiyuan's "Poetry Talks" has several wonderful words: "Recently, I have seen poets who rely entirely on dregs. Trivial and scattered, like shaving a monk's head, like unraveling stocking threads, adding notes to every sentence, treating poetry as textual research. Fearing that my words will harm them, I continue Yuan Yishan's last poem on poetry: 'A guest at the edge of the world is named Ling Chi, mistakenly taking copying books as poetry; when he copies to Zhong Rong's 'Poetry Grades' day, he should know the time of spirituality.'" It can be seen that the most ancient poems did not necessarily use allusions. In the "Airs of the States" in the Book of Songs, which one uses allusions? "You kindly think of me, lifting my skirt, I wade across the Zhen River. If you do not think of me, are there no other men? What a mad child he is!" How lively and natural this is, which one is an allusion! Also, like: "The little stars twinkle, Vega and Pleiades. Solemnly traveling at night, embracing quilts and silken gauze, truly fate is not the same!" Expressing one's heart of resentment, how profound! Because there is such a sentence in the poem, "The little stars twinkle," later generations take "little star" as an allusion for a concubine, which is truly ridiculous! We know that the more ancient the poetry, the more natural it is. The more it comes later, the more restrictions on poetry. Shen Yue had the theory of eight faults, making poetry look unrecognizable. Poets who want to write poetry and express their depression almost dare not write. Therefore, every time poetry goes into a dead end, there must be a great change, from poetry to lyrics, lyrics to music, music to new poetry, which is a clear example. Generally, people don't like lyrics much because lyrics are not easy to understand. Naturally, if lyrics are all like the example I gave above, Jiang Kui's "Ode to Plum Blossoms," like guessing a riddle, of course, it is not easy to understand. In fact, as long as it is good, whether it is poetry, lyrics, or songs, it is very natural, like Xin Youan's: "In youth, I knew not the taste of sorrow, loved to climb the tower, loved to climb the tower, forced to speak of sorrow when composing new poems. Now I know the taste of sorrow, wanting to speak but stopping, wanting to speak but stopping, but saying, 'What a cool autumn day.'" How clear this is. The rest, like Li Qingzhao and Lu Fangweng's lyrics, are very natural. Recently, I saw Li Qingzhao write "Green thick and red thin," and he came up with "Red thin and green thick." In short, turning around behind the buttocks of the ancients, only being a slave to others! The reason why Yuan Zhonglang's writing is wonderful is because he can compose his own words, which comes from himself, not relying on the ancients. What the ancients have not said, he insists on saying. What the ancients have said, he insists on not saying. He wrote to Zhang Youzi: "The world likes the Tang Dynasty, but I say that the Tang Dynasty has no poetry. The world likes the Qin and Han Dynasties, but I say that the Qin and Han Dynasties have no writing. The world despises the Song and rejects the Yuan Dynasty, but I say that poetry and writing are in the Song and Yuan Dynasty masters. In the past, Lao Tzu wanted to die the sage, Zhuang Sheng criticized and destroyed Confucius, but to this day, his book has not been abandoned. Xun Qing said that human nature is evil, and he can also be passed down with Mencius. Why? Seeing that it comes from oneself, not relying on half an ancient person, so he stands upright. Today's people, even if they criticize and slander him, cannot abolish him. Otherwise, chewing dregs in the dung, following the fart, relying on power to bully the good, like Suzhou throwing family members today, remembering a few well-known stories, saying they are knowledgeable, using a few ready-made words, also saying they are poets, deceiving Du Gongbu, hoarding Zha Li Kongtong, a hat of eight inches and three points, everyone can wear it, using this to speak of poetry, how can it not be poetry?... Now, people send rich merchants and say they are chivalrous, send county magistrates and say they are Heyang Pengze, this is formulaic language." What is valuable about formulaic language? Allusions are also formulaic language. If there is a similar thing, it can be applied, truly a hat of eight inches and three points. Finally, I have a sentence: A fake hat on the head will never be art!</p>
<h3>Puzhuang Correspondence</h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>Puzhuang is a small town with a rural atmosphere.</p>
<p>The town's connection with the city consists of two small steamers going to Suzhou: there are more than ten letters coming and going every day, a few Suzhou daily newspapers and tabloids, and the Shanghai newspapers only have a trimmed Shenbao delivered. If the steamer stops running, then the town's news from the outside world is completely cut off.</p>
<p>There is only one street in the town with some small shops, and it is still a narrow, nonsensical half-sided street. Walking to Xiatang Street, it is completely fields.</p>
<p>The narrow street has stones of varying heights. If you walk there in leather shoes, you might stumble in the middle of the street. Those small shops all have one-room storefronts. The only decent-looking ones are only two or three shops.</p>
<p>The narrow stone street, with scattered, dilapidated little shops, put together, seems like the days here are always a continuation of darkness, never exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>In reality, it's not really a town. You can walk through all the streets in less than fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>At night, there is no market and no electric lights. Several old-fashioned kerosene street lamps are also broken. At dusk, if it weren't for the people from the town going to the hot street, it would be difficult to walk. Underfoot, the stone street is uneven, and after a section of the street, it borders the river. Fumbling in the darkness, if you don't pay attention, you'll fall into the river.</p>
<p>When I first came here, I didn't dare go to the street at dusk without an acquaintance to walk with. Fumbling in such darkness is terrifying!</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, I came to enjoy the flavor of the small town's small teahouse for the first time with the village head and the principal of the local primary school. In front of the teahouse, there was a match stall. A few square tables and long benches were set up on the uneven mud. There were only a few tea drinkers. A kerosene lamp was hanging over the table, and in the cigarette-end-like yellow light, some flat faces moved under their hats. The loneliness of a foreign land, like the yellow light of a cigarette end, stung the tip of my heart.</p>
<p>The residents of the town are simple, unadorned, friendly, love to smoke, and walk lazily on the street, a style that is declining and wounded.</p>
<p>The local products here include coal wine and water shield vegetables, which are famous. Regarding the water shield vegetables, there is the story of hermit Zhang Han (Jiying) in history. He was the clerk of the Grand Marshal of the East Cao. Seeing the autumn wind rising, he thought of the wild rice and perch stew of Wuzhong. He sighed and said: "Life values fulfilling one's ambitions. How can I endure being an official thousands of miles away to seek fame and fortune?"</p>
<p>He then ordered his carriage and returned home (see "Book of Jin" for details).</p>
<p>It is said that the town originally had two markets every day, morning and afternoon, where farmers from nearby villages came to trade and do business. In recent years, it has not been as prosperous as it used to be. The tree market has also become desolate along with it.</p>
<h3>When Passing Linqi Larma (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Fei'er</p>
<p>When the driver reached Linqi Larma, he stopped to get gasoline, cold ice water, and rest briefly. As soon as we got out of the car, Hehe and his fat younger brother Lianggang ran up to us as soon as they saw us in front of their house.</p>
<p>We shook hands.</p>
<p>"Since moving here from Weila with Dad, we haven't been able to study," said Hehe, seventeen, with unusual sorrow when I asked the brothers about what happened after we last met.</p>
<p>His younger brother, who was a year younger than him, had a look of wanting to cry on his fat face, which was usually rarely troubled.</p>
<p>"Dad is: without work -- the natives don't have money to buy gold ornaments anymore! -- he teaches us how to do goldsmithing to help out at home. He said: 'What's the use of studying? Don't I know how to read? Haven't I made a lot of money? If it weren't for this damn world, would I be afraid of not having food? It's important to take care of our stomachs now that there's no work.' Dad's words are right, but how can we not study? Aren't we still kids? Don't we know anything?"</p>
<p>Listening to his continued story, I had nothing to say for a moment. Among my kids, besides Xiang, I loved those two the most. The reason was that the older brother was extremely clever, and although he was young, he had a preliminary understanding of this world; and the younger brother, although dull, was one of the most hardworking of the children.</p>
<p>"Hehe, since that's the situation," I said to the studious child after pondering for a moment, "it doesn't matter if you don't go to school for the time being, and it doesn't matter if you never have the chance to go to school again in the future. Because this world, schools are run for the rich; poor people, since they have to earn their living by their own hands, they also have to earn their books by their own strength. Besides, the books in school may not be beneficial to a person! Don't you remember the characters in the stories I told you? Don't you remember what I said to you when you left school?"</p>
<p>The child nodded. We all remembered that they had cried when they left school. And I had secretly come up with a set of reasons to comfort and encourage them. And now, as soon as we met, this speech was brought up again.</p>
<p>"Then, have you read all the books I gave you?" I asked them again.</p>
<p>"We've read them all, but there are many things we don't understand, and there's no one to ask here, it's really pitiful! -- I want to borrow some more books from the teacher to read!"</p>
<p>"Okay, after I return to K, I'll ask someone to bring them!"</p>
<p>At this time, the driver urged us to leave, and we had to stop talking.</p>
<p>"Don't forget to write me letters. Write everything you want to say in the letters. Today's conversation is not enough, not enough," I said when I got in the car.</p>
<p>"Okay. Wish you well, teacher! Wish all the classmates well!" They retreated from the side of the car, watching the car drive away with their eyes.</p>
<p>The joy I got from the white cloth of the "Overseas Chinese Primary School" in the rubber garden suddenly turned into disappointment, as if a basin of cold water had been poured on my head. Whenever I think of the poor children in the world who like to study, I can't help but feel a curse against this world rising in the minds of these children with real-life experiences, and a hope for the demise of the old era from hard study.</p>
<p>After returning to K, letters from these two children arrived from time to time. Even now, letters from Linqi Larma with a foreign postmark are sometimes placed on the table. Thinking that I am now relying on small articles to help with my tuition fees after repeatedly running into walls, the impression left on me by these two children when the car passed through Linqi Larma often reappears in my mind. (The End)</p>
<h3>Jianghu Traveller (8)</h3>
<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>The drooping brim of his felt hat covered his face low.</p>
<p>"Heard about it? Hey!"</p>
<p>His hand slammed on the table, and he raised his head from the dim lamplight. At this time, everyone could see that he was a comically odd fellow. The waiter had already brought the wine and dishes, and the two of them busied themselves. As if having caught something, he patted the waiter on the shoulder:</p>
<p>"Hey, old pal, like a loser from a big jail," (jailers are forbidden to call prisoners by name, they are generally referred to as "启见")...you. Haha..." He laughed loudly and sat down. He poured a full cup of wine into his stomach, smacked his lips, and shouted repeatedly: "Good! Good!"</p>
<p>As if he couldn't wait, he downed another cup.</p>
<p>"Get drunk today while you have wine." The waiter said slowly. He raised the cup to the tip of his nose, and then carefully flicked off a few drops, no more and no less. "Tell me the truth... there's something fishy, old man: the station?"</p>
<p>"The station, that's right, it's got... a damn thing, six legs!" (This is probably cursing the waiter.)</p>
<p>He put on a very nervous expression, and the waiter was bewildered. Suddenly, he grabbed "Xiang Pu" by the armpits and shook him wildly, making the old man throw his head back and scream. Then the two of them continued to laugh loudly, which could be heard on the street.</p>
<p>"Xiang Pu" didn't become stingy because of his old age. In fact, half of his wine was often drunk by the waiter. Perhaps it was to relieve boredom, but he seemed happy. He also knew what business he was doing, but like all prostitutes who were once popular, because of the tragedy of fate, he insisted on not nagging about "conscience."</p>

<p>Telegraph Special Anniversary Issue</p>
<h3>Prelude</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>It has been exactly one year since this publication met the public. On the occasion of this anniversary, we are grateful for the support of our colleagues, who have contributed their valuable manuscripts. Therefore, we have quickly compiled them into a special issue. However, before printing, there are things that cannot be left unsaid. It is because the strength of our colleagues is limited, and this publication discusses telegraphs, and the sources of materials are inevitably dry and uninteresting. In order to gain the sympathy of readers, live up to the expectations of society, and be able to publish on time without ever failing, it has also taken a lot of effort.</p>
<p>The telegraph industry has always lacked publications. Those that exist are only for the reading of people in the telegraph industry and have little connection with the outside world. Therefore, the telegraph industry knows the situation of the telegraph industry, but the outside world does not know it. Telegraphy is a business that facilitates public communication and is of great importance to the public. If the public does not know how to use telegraphy, or even does not know what telegraphy is (this kind of situation is probably unavoidable in remote and inland areas), then the public is the public, and telegraphy is telegraphy. Not only will telegraphy not be able to fully demonstrate its effectiveness, but also there will be no hope of development in the future. My colleagues at this company, weighing the current situation, believe that in order to seek the progress of the business, we must rely on the circulation of publications to instill common sense and communicate opinions. On the one hand, we should enable the outside world to understand the real situation of the telegraph industry, and on the other hand, we should seek criticism and opinions from all walks of life for the adoption and improvement of the transportation authorities. The purpose of this publication is based on this.</p>
<p>In terms of editing, the points that have been paid attention to the most in the past year are: First, the various constructions on the telegraph of the Ministry of Communications, and the newly revised regulations, which have not been published in other newspapers, or those that have been published but are not detailed or accurate, this publication must fully publish them to inform the society. Second, how can the public save money in communication? How can the delivery be fast? This publication widely collects information and strives for details. Third, opinions on improving the telegraph, this publication has also published many times. As for the questions raised by readers about telegraphs, this publication also answers them one by one, which is very convenient for public communication.</p>
<p>It is quite difficult to collect articles on telegraphic technology. Profound ones lack popularity, and superficial ones are well known. Introducing new European and American technologies, using simple words, and making deep and interesting explanations, meeting these conditions is naturally very welcome by this publication.</p>
<p>Members of the public have read this publication many times. Although it can still win the sympathy of the general public, my colleagues at this company will never take it for granted. As for those who suspect that this publication is doing excessive publicity for the Ministry of Communications, this cannot but be defended. It is because there are facts before there are records. In recent years, the Ministry of Communications has made innovations in the telegraph industry, such as reducing the price of telegrams, combining post and telegraph, expanding international circuits, increasing long-distance telephones, expanding company telephones, and various facilities that are clearly visible to everyone. This publication is a publication of the telegraph industry. If there is news that is indeed convenient for public communication, it should naturally be happy to publish it and add criticism. Otherwise, there is no practical publicity, and what value is there?</p>
<p>It is also said that countries with social progress use telegraphs and progress with each year. Because of the need for telegraphs, the discussion is always detailed. In order to seek the development of China's telegraph industry and widely collect opinions, it is urgent. This publication is of an open nature and dares to make another statement on the anniversary, respectfully asking people from all walks of life to give as much criticism as possible to the telegraph business.</p>
<h3>Review of China's Telecommunications Administration Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhou</p>
<p>Our publication has been around for a full year. During this year, most of China's telecommunications infrastructure has been successively published by our publication. However, on this anniversary, we should make a comprehensive review: What exactly has China's telecommunications administration done in the past year? What progress has China's telecommunications administration made?</p>
<p>In the past year, there have indeed been many telecommunications facilities. From these many facilities, I feel that three principles can be proposed, namely, scientific organization, rational construction, and commercialized operations. Now let us examine them separately.</p>
<p>I. Organization: In the past, the unsoundness of the telecommunications organization was undeniable. In some places, there was redundancy; in others, there was disproportionate emphasis. To give an example, each province has a Telecommunications Administration Bureau. As the name suggests, this bureau should manage the telecommunications of the entire province. However, in reality, it cannot manage the telephones of the entire area, and even in terms of telegraphs, it is limited to wired telegraphs. Moreover, its authority is really not about management, but merely a liaison between the Ministry of Communications and various bureaus. Thus, such a Telecommunications Administration Bureau cannot comprehensively plan and be responsible for improvement in a proactive way for the telecommunications of the entire region. On the negative side, it is an extra liaison, merely reducing administrative efficiency. In the past year, the telecommunications authorities have intended to improve the telecommunications organization. The first point is the merger of wired telegraph bureaus and wireless radio stations. The five places that have implemented this are Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Beiping, and Tianjin. In other places, radio stations must be under the command of the local telegraph bureau, which can also be regarded as a preliminary merger. The second point is the merger of telegraph bureaus and telephone bureaus. Suzhou is one place where this has been implemented, and the recently established Yuci Telephone Bureau is attached to the Telegraph Bureau. In the future, other telegraph and telephone bureaus will continue to merge in this way. What is particularly commendable is the third point: In June of this year, the Ministry of Communications promulgated a set of regulations for the Telecommunications Administration Bureau. These regulations stipulate that the bureau's duties are to manage all wired and wireless telegraphs, municipal and long-distance telephones, and various telecommunications businesses in the entire region. Therefore, the future situation will be that the telecommunications organization will have three levels: the Ministry of Communications at the top, the Telecommunications Administration Bureau in each region in the middle, and various direct business agencies at the bottom. The organization is rigorous, and the levels are well-defined. Administratively, the effect of commanding arms should be achieved. Moreover, because of the merger of bureaus and stations, and the merger of telegraphs and telephones, various different telecommunications businesses can be used for each other, demonstrating the greatest efficiency in telecommunications, and preventing them from undermining each other as before, causing the entire telecommunications system to fall into a state of confusion and contradiction. This can be regarded as the scientification of organization.</p>
<p>II. Construction: Compared with Europe and the United States, China's telecommunications equipment is still backward, and construction is certainly necessary. However, at a time when financial resources are stretched to the limit, even a little construction cost is borrowed from here and there, and rational construction is especially necessary. The so-called rationality is to conform to the principles of economics, using the smallest consumption to achieve the greatest effect. In the past year, we can see that telecommunications construction focuses on wireless telegraphs in the international field, wireless telegraphs in the border areas domestically, and long-distance telephones in the inland areas. This is a manifestation of rationalization. In the construction of international telecommunications, only the development of wireless telegraphs is possible under China's current situation. The biggest event in the past year was the opening of the Sino-British and Sino-Japanese telecommunications circuits. According to statistics, from the overall perspective of China's international telegraph services, Japan ranks first; from the perspective of Europe alone, the United Kingdom ranks first. Therefore, the opening of direct Sino-Japanese and Sino-British wireless circuits is of great significance to China's sovereignty in international communications. As for the construction of domestic telecommunications, China has always had wired and wireless telegraphs going their separate ways. This dual construction is really uneconomical. Now, wireless communications are being developed in the border areas as much as possible. In the past year, border radio stations have been established in Guihua, Zhangjiakou, Kangding, Ganzi, Ba'an, Lhasa, and other places. The radio stations in Guihua and Zhangjiakou were moved from Luoyang and Weihaiwei, and the Ningxia radio station, which will soon be established, was moved from Shashi. In one move, the function of the radio station is vastly different. In the inland areas, except for a few large cities, such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places, where wired telegraphs have been upgraded with Kleinschmidt machines and automatic teleprinters, all energy is concentrated on long-distance telephones. The completed projects include the Gu-Xun-Nan-Fu-Cheng line in Jiangxi, the Xi-Tong line in Jiangsu, and the water line between Yang and Zhen. The projects under construction include the long-distance telephone network in Jiangxi Province and the Jiu-Shao long-distance telephone trunk line, all of which are large-scale constructions. Another thing that is worth noting is that in the past year, more than 100 telegraph bureaus across the country have been converted into telegraph and telephone business offices or telegraph and telephone agency offices, which use telephones as a tool for transmitting telegrams in places where telegraph services are simple. Originally, long-distance telephones are a powerful tool for communication. They have the dual functions of local telephones and telegraphs. In European and American countries, there is a trend for long-distance telephones to replace telegrams. China will also be unavoidable in the future.</p>
<p>III. Business: There is no doubt that telecommunications must be commercialized, and China's telecommunications authorities have long been working towards this goal. However, in the past year, even more achievements have been made. Let's take telegraphs as an example. There are three reasons why China's telegraphs cannot be developed: 1. Telegraph prices are relatively high; 2. People do not have the habit of using telegraphs; 3. It is inconvenient to use telegraphs. In the past year, the telecommunications authorities have paid extraordinary attention to these three fundamental problems. First, the Ministry of Communications has stipulated a method of calculating the charges for the name and address of the recipient. All recipient place names and recipient names and addresses that do not exceed 15 characters are charged as five characters. This allows senders to universally enjoy the benefits of low prices. In addition, the extra fees for postal transfer telegrams and railway telegrams are all eliminated, which can also be regarded as a kind of telegraph price reduction. Secondly, the Ministry of Communications originally had a kind of social telegram. Now, the scope of this kind of telegram has been expanded, and it can be applied to postal transfer methods, and the price has been reduced. Whether it is a local or foreign province, Chinese characters are charged at two cents per character. This can guide the public to gradually develop the habit of using telegrams. Thirdly, the Ministry of Communications has been vigorously carrying out the joint establishment of post and telecommunications this year. In the future, telegrams can be sent wherever letters can be sent. In addition, the method of collecting telegrams on behalf of travel agencies has been expanded, the method of sending telegrams on account has been stipulated, and the attitude of the receiving and sending staff of various bureaus and stations has been improved. All of these provide a lot of convenience to senders and recipients. In short, this improvement is based on the principle of commercialization. In other telephone aspects, there have also been some improvements in business, which are still based on this principle, so there is no need to go into details one by one.</p>
<p>In this year, running the telecommunications administration is really not easy. Internationally, there are deeply entrenched foreign submarine cable companies competing fiercely. Domestically, because the government orders are not unified, there are endless instances of private radio stations and long-distance telephone projects. In this situation of internal and external attacks, the telecommunications administration itself feels great difficulties. However, even though the environment is bad, the telecommunications administration still has made considerable progress, which can also be regarded as a harvest of the efforts of the telecommunications authorities.</p>
<h3>Rationalization of the Telecommunications System Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhen</p>
<p>The rise and fall of various industries is greatly dependent on the quality of the system. The construction of a building requires precise design and perfect drawings in order to create a magnificent mansion. The principle is very clear. China's telecommunications industry has a long history of 53 years since the establishment of the Tianjin-Shanghai telegraph line in the sixth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (i.e., 1881 in the Western calendar). At that time, all organizational rules and regulations were borrowed from foreign advisors. Why has it still not been able to compare with Europe and the West? Although the reason is not limited to one aspect, the failure of the telecommunications system to be reformed in a timely manner is a major reason for the slow progress. When China established telegraphs, the telecommunications administration of European and American countries was still in its infancy. Later, others made rapid progress, while we adhered to the old ways. How can we not lag behind others? In the past year, the internal organizational system of the telegraph bureaus and stations under the Ministry of Communications, and the methods of handling telegraph services and other businesses, have undergone great changes as a result of the authorities' efforts to reform. As far as the Ministry of Communications' entire plan for reforming telecommunications is concerned, it is still in the initial stage. However, as far as telecommunications itself is concerned, the various improvements made by the national telecommunications authorities in the past year have indeed exceeded the accumulated changes of the previous 50 years. Readers may have some doubts about this. Please allow me to give a few examples to explain my point:</p>
<p>I. Re-determining the responsibilities of each section of the Telecommunications Department: In the past, each section of the Telecommunications Department was distinguished by numbers, such as the First Section, the Second Section, the Third Section, the Fourth Section, the Fifth Section, and the Sixth Section. The responsibilities of each section were not clearly defined. Taking the management of telecommunications personnel as an example, the First Section was in charge of the appointment and dismissal of directors and supervisors of telegraph and telephone bureaus and wireless radio station engineers and technicians, as well as business employees of bureaus and stations. The Second Section was in charge of the appointment and dismissal of engineers and line workers of telegraph trunk and branch lines. The Third Section was in charge of the appointment and dismissal of wired telecommunications technicians and telegraph operators. The Fourth Section was in charge of the appointment and dismissal of wireless telegraph operators and telephone technicians and operators. In the Telecommunications Department, which originally had six sections, four sections were in charge of the appointment and dismissal of telecommunications personnel alone. As for the responsibilities of the Telecommunications Department, it would not be impossible to divide them into three sections according to the nature of the business: wired, wireless, and telephone. However, at that time, the six sections did not stipulate which section was in charge of wired telecommunications, which section was in charge of wireless telecommunications, and which section was in charge of telephone. In other words, the above-mentioned responsibilities were too scattered, whether viewed from a vertical or horizontal perspective. Not only could the authority not be concentrated, but it also led to the disadvantages of wired, wireless, and telecommunications decoding not cooperating with each other, resulting in factionalism, which prevented common development. This is a bad system that is enough to affect the progress of the industry. Fortunately, the authorities of the Ministry of Communications realized this and resolutely reorganized the Telecommunications Department, renaming the six sections as Management, Engineering, Personnel, Business, Finance, and Materials. As the name suggests, you can know the responsibilities of each section. For example, the appointment and dismissal of telecommunications personnel, regardless of whether they are wired, wireless, or telephone personnel, are concentrated in the Personnel Section, and there is no fragmentation. The same is true for other business, engineering, finance, and materials matters. Not only is it convenient for senior officials to direct and supervise, but also when handling documents between sections, because the responsibilities are clearly defined, there is no room for each other to shirk responsibility. It can be seen that the re-determination of the responsibilities of each section of the Telecommunications Department is indeed one of the most important aspects of the rationalization of telecommunications facilities, and it is of great significance to the improvement of the telecommunications system. The Telecommunications Department is the general agency in the Ministry of Communications in charge of national telecommunications affairs, just like the central nervous system of the human body. If the central nervous system is not sound, the person's thoughts and actions will inevitably be abnormal.</p>
<p>II. Merger of Telegraph Bureaus and Stations: Wired and wireless transmissions of telegrams are only slightly different in terms of technology, but their functions and efficiencies are completely the same. And they are all telecommunications businesses run by the Ministry. Why divide them into telegraph bureaus and wireless radio stations, each acting on its own, resulting in competition between wired and wireless businesses? The merger of telegraph bureaus and wireless radio stations is self-evident and requires no further explanation. Since the Ministry of Communications merged the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau and the Wireless Radio Station on a trial basis in May of this year, the results have been very good. Therefore, in October, the telegraph bureaus and wireless radio stations in Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, and other places were merged. Wireless can indeed achieve the effect of complementing each other. Regarding the distribution of telegraph services, the fastest circuit can be selected for transmission or transfer. Suppose a telegram from Hangzhou to Chengdu is transmitted from Hangzhou to Shanghai, and from Shanghai to Hankou, using wired telegraphs, and from Hankou to Chengdu, it is transmitted via wireless. With such a connection and transmission of wireless, the speed of telegrams can indeed be greatly increased. The merger of bureaus and stations not only has significant functions for telegraph services, but also can tighten and save personnel expenses, so it is indeed another important reform of the telecommunications system.</p>
<p>III. Joint Establishment of Post and Telecommunications: The joint establishment of post and telecommunications is one of the important facilities of the Ministry of Communications this year. Post and telecommunications bureaus are both public communication agencies. Many European and Western countries have unified management. China's post and telecommunications have never been merged due to historical reasons. At the very least, they should be set up together to avoid the public having to travel back and forth to send letters and telegrams. Especially in commercial ports such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, etc., post offices have long been widely established with post office branches, with as many as 20 or 30 branches, while telegraph bureaus and stations have only two or three branch receiving and sending offices, at most no more than five or six. Taking the vast area of Shanghai as an example, the public feels deeply inconvenient to send telegrams. In view of this, the authorities of the Ministry of Communications issued a circular in April of this year, ordering post offices across the country to jointly establish with local telegraph bureaus. As for 47 places such as Shanghai, it is stipulated that the telegraph bureaus and stations in each place, as well as the specially approved branch receiving and sending offices and post office branches, should all universally and interactively set up post office branches and telegraph receiving and sending offices. After implementation, telegrams and letters can be sent simultaneously in telegraph bureaus and stations and post office branches across the country. The benefits to the public are by no means insignificant.</p>
<p>IV. Adding Telegraph and Telephone Business Offices and Agency Offices: In places where commerce is not very prosperous, if a telegraph bureau or wireless radio station is set up, its business income is often not enough to cover the expenses of employees' salaries and materials. However, state-run telecommunications businesses are by no means exclusively for profit, and the convenience of public communications must also be taken into consideration. Therefore, in order to take both into account, the Ministry of Communications, in addition to reorganizing the telegraph branches at the end of the telegraph line into telegraph and telephone business offices, specially added telegraph and telephone business offices or agency offices in various places to facilitate communication in each place. At the same time, the organization of these business offices and agency offices is extremely simple. The business office only needs to set up one business clerk and one line worker, and the agency office is handled by merchants on behalf of the government. The regular expenses are extremely low, and it can indeed take both telecommunications economy and public communication into consideration. This is a rationalized system.</p>
<p>V. Telecommunications Accounting System: In the past, how many assets or liabilities did the telecommunications authorities have? And what was the total annual operating income and capital expenditure (including materials and employees' salaries) of the national telegraph bureaus and stations and telephone bureaus? In fact, there were no accurate statistics. This is the inadequacy of the telecommunications accounting system, which cannot be denied. It is heard that the Accounting Office of the Ministry of Communications is now working hard to promote the new telecommunications accounting system. Given a reasonable amount of time, telecommunications accounting will be completely renewed and will completely wash away the chaotic phenomena of the past. The promotion of the new accounting system is indeed a much-needed reform, and it is also an important facility in the telecommunications system in the past year.</p>
<p>Looking back on the above-mentioned reforms of various systems in the past year, in terms of management, they have concentrated authority and unified command. In terms of business, they have strived to promote and commercialize in order to facilitate the public. And it makes us feel that China's telecommunications industry has indeed been advancing towards a rationalized path.</p>
<h3>The Process and Recent Situation of the Ministry of Communications' Telegraph and Telephone Bureaus and Stations Implementing Unified Revenue and Expenditure</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>In view of the fact that during the era of the Northern Government, warlords in various provinces arbitrarily appointed bureau chiefs, intercepted telegraph and telephone fee income, and made extravagant and unwarranted reports, the Ministry of Communications, in order to control the funds of various bureaus and implement open revenue and expenditure, signed a contract with the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau in June of this year to act as an agent for collecting and paying telegraph and telephone fees. It stipulates that the telegraph and telephone fee income of the first-class or higher telegraph bureaus, telephone bureaus, and wireless radio stations in Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin, and other places shall be uniformly entrusted to the local postal savings and remittance bureau for collection, and monthly expenses shall be paid by the savings and remittance bureau. However, due to the varying income of the bureaus and stations in each place, revenue and expenditure can be balanced in busy months, but in off-peak months, revenue and expenditure may not be offset. Therefore, it is stipulated in the contract that when monthly revenue and expenditure cannot be offset, the excess expenditure shall be used as the Telecommunications Department's overdraft funds from the Savings and Remittance Bureau. The total overdraft amount is limited to 100,000 national currency, and the international telegraph fee income is designated as a guarantee for the overdraft funds, and it is uniformly entrusted to the Savings and Remittance Bureau for collection. All principal and interest of the overdraft should be paid in full before the 15th of the following month. If it cannot be paid on time, the Savings and Remittance Bureau may suspend the payment of the next month's expenses. This contract was signed by the responsible personnel of both parties and came into effect on July 1.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the contract implementation, some postal workers, because they did not fully understand the content of the contract, were deeply afraid that the guarantee was not accurate, and that the overdraft funds would not be able to be compensated in the future, which would inevitably affect the postal economy. They repeatedly requested the Ministry of Communications to abolish the contract. After detailed explanation by the authorities of the Ministry of Communications, a storm was quelled. The detailed situation was recorded in various newspapers at the time, so I will not repeat it here.</p>
<p>In fact, this type of business is one of the universal businesses of banks, and the international telegraph fee of the Telecommunications Department is increasing month by month due to business development, and the guarantee is also very reliable. When the Telecommunications Department started planning the unified revenue and expenditure method, it contacted several banks such as a certain bank to negotiate and sign contracts. The banks, in view of the fact that the monthly telegraph and telephone fee deposits of the bureaus and stations were extremely large, not only had large amounts of funds that could be used for circulation in terms of cash, but also had considerable income from monthly interest and remittance rates, so they undertook the contract. In order to assist the cooperation between post and telecommunications, the Ministry of Communications finally decided to entrust the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to undertake the contract. This is the process of signing the contract. The following is a list of the revenue and expenditure figures for the four months of July, August, September, and October (according to the statements of the Savings and Remittance Bureau):</p>
<p>Month  Revenue from Telegraph and Telephone Fees Expenses Paid on Behalf of the Agency Remittance Rate Interest on Overdrafts</p>
<p>July  412,988.46 yuan  631,693.50 yuan  1,438.50 yuan  356.48 yuan</p>
<p>August  870,467.83 yuan  690,550.89 yuan  1,267.73 yuan  None</p>
<p>September 870,467.83 yuan  677,232.22 yuan  1,194.64 yuan  203.60 yuan</p>
<p>October 755,889.33 yuan  752,095.60 yuan  1,475.81 yuan  104.58 yuan</p>
<p>Total 2,650,387.45 yuan 2,751,572.21 yuan 6,276.68 yuan 664.66 yuan</p>
<p>Monthly Average 662,596.86 yuan 687,893.05 yuan 1,566.17 yuan 166.16 yuan</p>
<p>According to the above figures, the revenue in July was only more than 400,000 yuan, and the expenditure was more than 630,000 yuan. After offsetting the revenue and expenditure, there was a shortfall of about 220,000 yuan. The revenue in August was more than 870,000 yuan, and the expenditure was more than 690,000 yuan. After offsetting the revenue and expenditure, there was a surplus of about 180,000 yuan. The difference between the revenue and expenditure of the two months is huge. The reason is that at the beginning of the implementation of the method, the calculation of various incomes was extremely complicated, and it was a little difficult to record the accounts. Therefore, a part of the income in July was not cleared in time and was transferred to August for joint calculation. The average monthly income for two months is about 640,000 yuan. September happened to be an off-peak month, and the income decreased slightly. The income in October increased by 110,000 yuan compared with the previous month. The expenditure also increased slightly by more than 27,000 yuan compared with the expenditure in the previous three months of July, August, and September due to special expenditures such as employee promotions. The overdraft interest for the four months was only 664 yuan, and the remittance rate earned by the Savings and Remittance Bureau was more than 6,270 yuan. The overdraft interest for the four months was only 664 yuan, and the remittance rate earned by the Savings and Remittance Bureau was more than 6,270 yuan. The remaining 27,000 yuan was returned by the Telecommunications Department in full under the guarantee item (international telegraph fee). It can be seen that this is indeed one of the postal and telecommunications cooperation methods, and it is also mutually beneficial.</p>
<h3>The Telegraph Business Inspection Work in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Zhong Ming</p>
<p>Our country's telegraph business has been established for more than 50 years. The business situation has not yet reached the stage of prosperity and development. Compared with Europe and the United States, we are far behind them. Compared with our neighbor in the East, it is also difficult to catch up. Considering the reasons: due to years of civil war, the commercial situation is depressed; official telegrams are overdue, and the telecommunications funds are stretched; business is neglected, and transmission is delayed; technology is poor, and errors are frequent. About half of the general public has low knowledge and does not know how to use telegraphs; they have weak economic strength and cannot use telegraphs; or they feel that the bureaucracy of the telegraph bureau is too deep and they are unwilling to use telegraphs. However, in recent years, the above-mentioned malpractices have been greatly improved within the scope of the powers of the Ministry and the capacity of the Ministry, and the atmosphere has been completely renewed. However, the colleagues of the Ministry are not complacent about this. In order to understand the public's opinions and criticisms on the service of the telegraph bureau, and at the same time, to publicize all the new facilities and reforms of the telecommunications administration to the public, the telegraph business inspector was established. This method started in June last year, and its tasks are:</p>
<p>1. To inquire whether there are any delays or errors in incoming and outgoing telegrams;</p>
<p>2. To inquire whether the staff of the telegraph bureau overcharge telegraph fees;</p>
<p>3. To inquire whether there are any omissions in the translation of ordinary or urgent Chinese and foreign language telegrams;</p>
<p>4. To inquire whether the messengers demand tips or falsely charge translation fees for incoming telegrams;</p>
<p>5. To interview the public on their opinions and other dissatisfactions with the telegraph bureau;</p>
<p>6. To explain to the public various methods of saving telegraph fees and their procedures;</p>
<p>7. To distribute various telegraph regulations, telegraph price lists, and newspaper clippings;</p>
<p>8. To answer inquiries from the public to the telegraph bureau;</p>
<p>9. To explain misunderstandings about the telegraph bureau to senders and recipients;</p>
<p>10. To attract business;</p>
<p>11. To secretly investigate whether there are any illegal or private communication agencies in the local area.</p>
<p>Looking at the above points, the business inspection work does occupy an important position in the telecommunications business. Therefore, the Ministry is extremely cautious in the selection of inspectors. They must be well-educated, proficient in the regulations, and have moral cultivation before they are assigned. Thanks to the efforts of the inspectors of various bureaus and stations and the cooperation of the public over the past year, the results of the work have been somewhat effective: The estrangement between the public and the telegraph bureau in the past has been cleared away by the explanation of the inspectors; The new regulations and facilities of various telecommunications administrations have been publicized by the inspectors, so that the public can understand and know how to use them; As for all the dissatisfactions or constructive matters of the public with the telegraph bureau, the telegraph bureau can know the situation by relying on the comprehensive investigation of the inspectors, so as to use it as a reference for improving the business. As for the inspectors encountering the public inquiring about all matters related to telegrams, they also do their best to handle them and give the public a satisfactory answer. For this reason, the public's impression of the telegraph bureau has become better and better; Their understanding of the effectiveness of telegraphs has become more and more clear. Over the past year, the considerable progress in domestic and international telegraph business has been due to many reasons, and the publicity of the business inspectors can also be a help in developing the business.</p>
<h3>One Year of This Publication</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Whether a cause develops or not? It must depend on whether the cause is needed by the public, and whether it can gain the public's sympathy. The former is an economic issue, and the latter is a psychological issue. This is the case for private enterprises, and it is also the case for state-run enterprises. China's telecommunications are state-run. In terms of history, it has been more than fifty years. In terms of its bureaus, there are only 1,050 wired telegraph bureaus, only 47 wireless telegraph bureaus, and only 21 telephone bureaus. Telecommunications bureaus in remote provinces are even rarer. In terms of its lines, there are only 47 aerial lines, 3,360.99 kilometers of submarine cables. Given China's large population and vast area, the number of telegrams sent is only 5,862,000, ranking tenth in the world, and far less than one-ninth of Japan's! Whether from the perspective of national defense, transportation, or culture, it is clear that China needs the development of telecommunications.</p>
<p>In view of this, the staff of this publication believes that China's telecommunications must be needed by the public, and must also gain the public's sympathy, before it can develop. Therefore, on this day last year, we launched this publication as a supplement to the Shanghai Shen Bao. We try our best to publish news about telecommunications construction, so that the society can understand the government's policies. We try our best to publish opinions on telecommunications reform, so that the government can adopt the opinions of our staff. We try our best to introduce articles on telecommunications knowledge, so that people from all walks of life can learn about the procedures for sending and receiving telegrams, and the principles of telecommunications engineering. In the past year, the total number of articles in this publication is 48 on commentary, 40 on general knowledge, 50 on reports and news, 29 on overseas telecommunications, and 18 miscellaneous articles, totaling over two hundred. At the same time, several thousand copies are additionally printed and sent to various bureaus and stations in the country each issue, and distributed to various telegraph operators. And for the sake of easy preservation, we plan to compile the articles from each issue of this publication into separate publications. The goal for the next few decades is to transform what used to be perceived as "the mystery of telecommunications" and present it to the public. This is the intention behind the publication.</p>
<p>Since this publication aims to publicize telecommunications, has the current state of telecommunications reached the realm of being public? Has the public gained considerable sympathy? This must be reviewed on this one-year anniversary. Regarding the former, our staff dare not be complacent with the current situation, and should continue to serve the country and society with sincerity. We will speak out on all matters of promoting benefits and eliminating disadvantages in telecommunications, knowing everything and saying everything, and saying everything to the fullest. Regarding the latter, we must rely on the criticism and cooperation of the public. I dare not make presumptions. However, judging from the 837 letters received by our company from all walks of life in the past year, 711 of them requested copies of the regulations, accounting for about 84 percent, 62 inquired about the situation of telegraphs and telephones, accounting for about 8 percent, and 64 requested to read this publication, accounting for about 8 percent. This small number is placed among China's population. It is indeed insignificant! But overseas, such as Japan, and inland, such as Sichuan and Guizhou, are all communicating with our company. We cannot say that this publication has made no contribution to society, nor can we say that the public is still indifferent to telecommunications. Looking at Mr. Wang Yunsheng's [Lushan Travel Notes], which praised the seriousness of the Guling Telegraph Bureau's work, and Mr. Tao Menghe's article [Future Administrative Officials], which also stated that [telegraphic communication has increased many conveniences compared to the past], and Director Wang's administrative report, which praised the achievements of telecommunications reorganization, it is evident that the people of the country have a considerable degree of sympathy and understanding of the telecommunications industry.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, China's telecommunications are needed by the public and have gained great public sympathy. If it can advance bravely, it will not be difficult to catch up with Europe and the United States. The staff of this publication, speaking from the standpoint of the people, are all a part of the public. Speaking from the perspective of job relations, they are all a part of the telecommunications staff. They believe that China's telecommunications should be: 1. Scientifically managed, 2. Rationally constructed, 3. Commercially operated, and 4. Publicly communicated. To achieve this goal, the government and the people must cooperate. Our staff will make faithful evaluations with an impartial attitude, and base the publication's speech policy on the above principles. On the occasion of this anniversary, we would like to present the purpose of this publication and its progress over the past year to the country for correction.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>On Lying and Deception</h3>
<p>— Jingxi</p>
<p>[In a history book, apart from the year, month, day, time, name, and place, most of the historical facts recorded are lies and deception. Conversely, although the characters, places, times, and dates in a novel are fictitious, the facts within the text are true.] I have forgotten the name of the person who said this, but after examining it from various perspectives, I feel that his words are largely correct, and it is not an exaggeration to say that he is almost close to the truth.</p>
<p>Since a history book is full of lies, it shows that mankind has valued hypocrisy since ancient times. However, as time goes by, no state of affairs does not develop at high speed to the tip of that state of affairs. Just taking the two words "lying and deception" now, I am afraid that even the most skilled liar in ancient times would have to sigh at the breadth of its scope and the complexity of its content.</p>
<p>[A gentleman values righteousness, a petty person values profit.] The ancients separated a kind of good person and a kind of bad person in society long ago, but we also understand that this is a very unreliable lie, because there is no person called a gentleman who does not praise the current emperor's virtue in his poetry, and at that time, the current emperors were not necessarily all that good. In this way, lying and deception have evolved into a kind of public secret that has [been around for a long time,] and it is not reckless to say that [it is even worse today]. Therefore, it is not surprising that a small crook standing on the road sells you a fake Parker pen and says it is real, especially since they are petty people, and to put it more thoroughly, their miserable lives drive them to do so.</p>
<p>As such. Wouldn't the author be accused of advocating [lying and deception]? But I must say no again. I feel that it is okay to tell a lie in certain situations, and it may even be beneficial. Regarding this, some people have already felt it, and some people have also said it, but that lying and deception is okay is [to people], such as if a pregnant woman's husband has died, but when she asks about him, you say that her husband is healthy and well, so that you can protect two lives, and so on. What I think is okay, is that I don't want to tell lies to people too much, but it's okay to lie to yourself a little. Perhaps many people like me are practicing this kind of self-deception, but saying it makes me feel a burst of sadness in my heart.</p>
<p>Some people say that if life lacks hope and lacks dreams, life will be bland and tasteless, but I say that in addition to hope and dreams, lying and deception are also indispensable, and perhaps the three can be one in the first place.</p>
<h3>Buying Cheap Goods</h3>
<p>— Niu</p>
<p>I originally didn't like to buy cheap goods at [blood-loss clearance sales]. I was determined to hold this view for two reasons: first, since they have sacrificed their blood capital, it seems a bit unbearable for me to take advantage of them; second, cheap goods are never better goods, so I don't buy them.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, because the landlady wanted to make a bed sheet, she said, the bed sheet that is currently used is already broken. Isn't today's newspaper carrying a big price reduction at XX store, with plain-dyed twill cloth at one yuan and five yards? Go and buy it quickly after you eat.</p>
<p>Because I was [broke], I pretended not to see the broken bed sheet. Today, my wife forced me to buy it. It was really [impossible to resist, and duty-bound]. After eating lunch, I took the only [Yuan head] [silver dollar] and took the tram to the destination to buy it.</p>
<p>Stepping into the store, a gentleman at the counter glanced at me and asked, [What do you want to buy?]</p>
<p>I replied, [White twill cloth for one yuan and five yards.] He pretended to be foolish and said that the cloth was sold out.</p>
<p>I said that it was still just past one o'clock in the afternoon, and it was already sold out. How much cloth did you sell in the end? When did you start selling, and when did you sell out?</p>
<p>He had nothing to say, so he said that there were good ones.</p>
<p>I said I also know that you have good ones, but I can't afford good ones, so I came to your store to buy some cheap goods. Now that they are sold out, I have to say [sorry] and leave. I came with excitement, but I inevitably returned with less excitement, and the landlady was naturally very disappointed.</p>
<p>Yesterday my friend Mr. Hu came to my house. I asked, [Why did you come so early today?]</p>
<p>He said repeatedly: [How unreasonable!] How unreasonable! Didn't a certain newspaper today publish that a certain leather goods store had rough leather felt for nine jiao and nine fen a piece? Today I made an appointment with a friend to buy it, but they said it was already sold out. I (the friend said) questioned him, it's still early now, and it's already sold out. I ask, when can I come to buy it to get it? It's obviously deceiving people, making us run in vain. It's really [how unreasonable!] After speaking, he was still panting breathlessly.</p>
<p>When I encountered the above two things, I was very indignant at first, but later I thought about it, I was really extremely foolish. I didn't practice forgiveness at all. Asking now that the market is so sluggish, inactive, the house prices are so high! The expenses are so large! The capital is so heavy! The decoration is so rich! And the goods still have to sacrifice their capital. You think, even if there are as many as Zhang Zongchang's dozen or so concubines, I'm afraid they can't afford to make up for the loss. Thinking this way, I also felt at peace.</p>
<p>But I think for them, it's also not worth it. There are naturally stores that really sell cheap goods, but they advertise cheap goods, but there are no cheap goods. It is a bit deceiving and too ridiculous, but this kind of plan will not sell in the end. People come with the goal of buying cheap goods, and they will definitely not buy expensive goods if they can't buy cheap goods. This is inevitable. As a result, they only lose their own credibility, and business may not necessarily increase sharply.</p>
<p>Just like the shop I went to buy cheap goods the day before yesterday, I usually trust them very much, because the goods in this shop are indeed a bit cheaper than other shops, but since this time I was fooled, I have not entered its door. Therefore, I think there must be many people with my point of view.</p>
<p>So yesterday I saw an advertisement published by a store, saying that printing errors may occur, and only the prices marked on the company's goods shall prevail. Very right, very right.</p>
<h3>Queen's Year</h3>
<p>The merchant's palm</p>
<h3>East, South, West, North</h3>
<p>— Sanduo</p>
<p>Tang Jincheng, a worker at the Nanshi China Tramway Company, went to the Shanghai Drought Relief Association on Wuma Road on the morning of the day before yesterday and donated all the one hundred silver dollars he had saved over the years by cutting back on food and clothing to the Association, asking them to transfer it to the drought-stricken people who had been displaced.</p>
<p>The great drought that has not been seen in sixty years was once a grand and lively event, and even fasting and praying to Buddha, inviting Zhang Tianshi, who had been expelled from Longhu Mountain, to set up an altar to perform rituals. Sure enough, the Buddha's law was boundless, and the good wish was fulfilled. However, this little bit of willow branch nectar was not very helpful. The drought in various places is still very serious. The farmers in Suzhou have had a riot that is neither big nor small.</p>
<p>Naturally, the current problem should be to continue to provide relief to the disaster victims who have been affected by the drought after praying for rain. Or, I, the author, read the newspaper too carelessly, and only today did I read the above news. One hundred yuan is certainly a very small amount, but it is much more meaningful than just doing the kowtowing work respectfully before the event!</p>
<h3>Empty Heart</h3>
<p>— Hu Renmu</p>
<p>Returning from the hospital, I brought back an uneasy heart. I am always worried: what if she is unfortunate and dies?</p>
<p>I especially resent that nurse for not letting me stay in the hospital to watch over her, which makes me uneasy.</p>
<p>[Come see me tomorrow.]</p>
<p>That's what she said to me, which is actually driving me away.</p>
<p>At that time, as I was going down the stairs, I was also calculating:</p>
<p>[Why don't you let me watch over her? I am her man, is there any inconvenience?]</p>
<p>But I finally left the hospital.</p>
<p>Although my person left the hospital, my thoughts did not. I only felt that my whole spirit was still in the hospital, and I still saw my wife holding her stomach in pain, unable to sit or stand still.</p>
<p>In the evening, I was even more troubled, on the one hand, I felt that the room was particularly empty, and on the other hand, I was still worried about my wife in the hospital. One o'clock, two o'clock passed, three o'clock, four o'clock passed, everyone else was asleep, only I could not sleep. Occasionally hearing heavy footsteps outside the door, I would nervously think:</p>
<p>[Could it be that something unexpected happened in the hospital, and someone was sent to deliver a message?]</p>
<p>It was not until dawn that I barely closed my eyes, but after a while, I got up again.</p>
<p>But then I was worried, how can I get through this morning? What can I do to kill time? Read a book. No, there has never been a time when my mind was so uneasy like today. I read a book, looking at the pages, it turned into a black blur, or, countless black-headed flies jumped out of the book, and after a while, it was a blank piece of paper again.</p>
<p>Then, lie down again, maybe I haven't slept enough, which affects my eyesight. I threw my body onto the bed like throwing a package, and closed my eyes tightly.</p>
<p>No, in my tightly closed eyes, I could actually see the bright daylight outside, see the vehicles and pedestrians running on the street, see the gate of the hospital, and see my wife holding her stomach in pain, unable to sit or stand still. …</p>
<p>No, I can't sleep, my head is spinning like a wheel. Suddenly, I stood up and sent my footsteps to the street. Let's stroll, in this way, strolling around, time will pass unknowingly.</p>
<p>Why is my heart so uneasy, so anxious?</p>
<p>Walking on the road, I remembered what my wife said before being admitted to the hospital:</p>
<p>[I'm afraid, I'm afraid it won't be good...]</p>
<p>Before I got to the hospital, I was thinking about the hospital. When I got to the hospital gate, I was a little hesitant. This is the truth when I spent the first half of the day in a daze and ran to the hospital in the second half. Really, when I walked to the hospital door, my feet were nailed to the ground like two nails, and I didn't move at all. My heart was beating very fast, afraid of that unfortunate encounter.</p>
<p>Finally, I lifted my foot and walked upstairs. The nurse saw me and told me:</p>
<p>[The child is born, go and see. The adults are also doing well.]</p>
<p>An empty heart, at this time, can be considered to have fallen to solid ground. My wife finally got through the difficult time of childbirth safely. I am relieved.</p>
<h3>Uncle</h3>
<p>— Yonghui</p>
<p>It was the days when my father was alive. At that time, I was very young. He—my uncle—came. His face was very pretty, and he was very young—about twenty-three years old? He was very polite to everyone he met.</p>
<p>In the third year after my father's death, he came again! This time was very different. He had taken up opium. A twenty-six-year-old man, but he was so old that people could hardly recognize him. He was wearing worn-out clothes, simply a typical beggar.</p>
<p>When he saw my mother, he knelt down, and tears fell in strings. He looked very pitiful. He first asked about the situation when my father died, and then explained the reason why he could not return to attend the funeral, asking my mother to forgive him. My mother, of course, had no objection.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>After dinner, he sat on the chair in a daze; he sighed deeply, stood up lazily, and walked to my mother:</p>
<p>[Just this smoke, sister-in-law.]</p>
<p>[You have taken up opium?] My mother looked at him with surprise.</p>
<p>[Yes.]</p>
<p>[Why did you learn this bad habit?]</p>
<p>[What can I do? It's too late to regret.]</p>
<p>[Can't you quit?]</p>
<p>[Quitting all at once will kill me. I have to quit slowly.]</p>
<p>[How much money do you spend on opium every day now?]</p>
<p>[Two yuan.]</p>
<p>[You have taken up opium. Do the customs know?]</p>
<p>[How can they not know? That's why I lost my job.]</p>
<p>Since then, my uncle lived in my house for three years in a row. Not only did he not quit smoking, but he also learned to gamble.</p>
<p>It was a severe winter, and everyone was not asleep yet. Snow was flying outside. The door opened with a [creak].</p>
<p>[Who]? my mother asked.</p>
<p>[Me]. The voice was trembling.</p>
<p>[Uncle Jian?]</p>
<p>[Yes].</p>
<p>He came in. His fur coat and velvet trousers were gone! His body was trembling badly.</p>
<p>[You gambled away all your clothes on such a snowy day. Aren't you afraid of freezing to death?] My mother, who rarely got angry, was angry this time.</p>
<p>[I won't gamble next time.] Every time, it was such a canned sentence.</p>
<p>Smoking opium and gambling became his life.</p>
<p>My mother doesn't give him much money now, except for the two yuan for opium every day. He often goes to his neighbors to speak ill of my mother.</p>
<p>In the end, he stole six hundred silver dollars from the money box, gold bracelets, rings, and a piece of ancient book worth more than one thousand yuan and ran away.</p>
<p>It was another three years. My uncle appeared in the county town of this county! He was still smoking opium, but he really didn't gamble anymore! He still came to live in our house.</p>
<p>War, floods, and droughts swept the entire countryside. We ourselves couldn't survive. The family was scattered. My uncle also left our house, and it has been six years now. There is no news from him, like a stone sinking into the sea.</p>
<p>Fiction</p>
<h3>Liu Desheng in Jiangxi (8)</h3>
<p>— Wanguo An</p>
<p>(5) Fellow Villager</p>
<p>After Liu Desheng wrapped a red cloth around his neck, he officially became a small Red soldier inside the Soviet of Matizhou Town.</p>
<p>Matizhou Town is located south of Yongfeng County, about twenty miles away from the county seat. There are more than two hundred households in the town. Chen Yi's more than 3,000 Red Army soldiers often came to the Yongfeng County border to engage in guerrilla warfare, so this not-so-big Matizhou Town became Chen Yi's headquarters.</p>
<p>Since the Central Army recovered Yongfeng County, it has been actively preparing to build roads and forts to advance to the ancient county. Sergeant squad leader Liu Desheng's team was just transferred from Shangrao, northeastern Jiangxi, in preparation for garrisoning! Less than five days after arriving in Yongfeng City, Liu Desheng was sent out to engage in guerrilla warfare. As soon as this big black guy saw the mountains, his two flag-pole-like long legs trembled! His eyes saw stars, and his heart was confused. After taking a nap on the hillside, he was captured by the militia in Matizhou Town.</p>
<p>Whether to be a Red Army soldier, a Green Army soldier, or any kind of soldier didn't matter to the big black guy. But the first few days were always a little uncomfortable. Damn it! He doesn't get any free time. He can do whatever they say, learn to fight, but they insist on teaching him some kind of ism! Damn it! He has a lot of isms. Gambling at pai gow, drinking strong liquor, and playing with women are all more brilliant than anything else. As soon as the big black guy lay down on that pile of weeds at night, he muttered like this in his heart. Although he didn't do it very enthusiastically! But he didn't dare to say it. One day in the graveyard in the west of the village, nine people who were in the White Army were stabbed to death with spears because they didn't want to be Red Army soldiers and were sentenced to death. The big black guy stood beside him and saw it very clearly at the time.</p>

<p>Opening [Sparrow Battle]</p>
<p>Land of Gods and Immortals, gathering for joy and pleasure. Playing chess and sipping wine, a good time to linger. Lately, the most popular is Mahjong. Guests are invited to play a few rounds. Winning is better than simply visiting a bamboo garden. First, explain the thirteen tiles of dominoes. The rest are stacked in a well-like circle. One bamboo. Two myriads of officials. Nine coppers are a pity, they cannot be strung together. North, south, east, and west are divided into four seats. The door scene is doubled when touched. Center, fortune, and white are not easy to get. Troubles arise from discarding tiles everywhere. The opening reveals the hidden and the bright. Starting the game requires paying attention to the numbers. Coincidental pure and mixed suits are judged. A sequence of four joys is not easy to witness. A peaceful game with no losses. It's hateful when a constant dealer always wants to finish. Winning or losing on the deal is truly doubled. Only about ten circles can be effective in a day. Lately, many old mahjong players. Newcomers also have to donate money. I advise you not to take winning or losing too seriously. The middle is full of things to avoid. Don't be greedy when acting in a play.</p>

Early sweet dew, late Taigong. Pengzu's lifespan was eight hundred years. Yan Hui's short life was too intelligent. It's not that Heaven is unfair or Earth is unjust. It's that gains and losses, glory and disgrace, are determined by fate. I advise people not to be busy and to struggle for fame and gain in vain. Where you can be carefree, enjoy yourself. When you encounter love, enjoy nine cups of wine. Evil bullies are mostly fake. Have you ever seen the double-pupiled Xiang Yu? Ten thousand zhang are hard to match a heroic general. He only ended up cutting his throat at the Wujiang River, all in vain. Han Xin's meritorious achievements were called the top ten. Later, he died in the Weiyang Palace. Isn't much of it in dreams?</p>

<h3>Lili Hayworth's Latest Plan</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Wasn't there a rumor a month or two ago that Lili Hayworth was going to leave Hollywood? But her recently announced new plan is not only not to return to her country immediately, but also to call her fiancé Willy Fritsch to co-star in a new film with her. What a surprising news!</p>
<p>Willy is an actor from the German Ufa company, and his contract with Ufa expires in January next year. Lili specially used a transatlantic telephone to persuade him to come to Hollywood at that time.</p>
<p>Lili told a reporter: [After the new film was completed, I asked Fox to terminate the unexpired contract and let me go. I was so sad and depressed. I was willing to give up the benefits I deserved and made this decision because I thought about the disappointment Hollywood gave me. The mental pain was so great that losing a huge amount of money was nothing. ]</p>
<p>[But as soon as the news that I was leaving here came out, I didn't expect that many telegrams would come from all over, and even specially sent representatives to persuade me to stay. This was a great comfort to my spirit and encouraged my courage to work again. Now I have decided to make at least one more film before leaving the United States to thank my friends who care for me.</p>
<p>[This time, Fox gave me a new contract that allows me to choose the script myself and not do any more plays that I don't like. I think the plot of the script does not have to be complicated. As long as the play is well made, even a simple plot can be welcomed by the audience. You see, from the opening of [Dragon Soaring and Phoenix Dancing] to now, I have not heard any bad criticisms. I love to do this kind of play, and people love it too.]</p>
<p>[I want Willy to come to the United States to co-star in a film with me, but he is worried that his not very fluent English will not be welcomed. I don't think the audience will be too demanding on these small things! His smile will definitely fascinate Americans. Don't they love Shevalier's smile? Shevalier even praised Willy's smile as more moving than his own.]</p>
<p>[Some people say that Willy and I have already gotten married in Switzerland, which is really a joke. If we were really married, why would we deny it? Before I came to Hollywood, although we had talked about marriage, because we couldn't be together often, and we had to do our own work across the Atlantic Ocean, who could guarantee that there would be no changes after we left? So we agreed to put the marriage on hold for a few years. Now I know that he is still the same as before, without any changes. I have known him for five years, and he is always so gentle, calm, and smiling.]</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of [The Human Tragedy]</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The Human Side – Cathay –</p>
<p>[The Human Tragedy], yes, this is the tragedy of life. This deeply touched us, the petty bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>This is a work depicting human relationships. We often feel this kind of desolate and spicy taste in many bourgeois literary works. Not long ago, Galsworthy's [Clouds and Rain of a Broken Heart], which was shown at Cathay, was a good example. Of course, we cannot accept Galsworthy's reformism, but his serious and humorous style of human relationships has won considerable moving people. Yes, human relations and tastes are indeed very suitable for the taste of the troubled intellectuals.</p>
<p>The stage play director described here, like the writers in general, wrote him as a romantic, unrestrained character. At the same time, his conscience is good. Although he is separated from his wife, he is still very kind and caring for his wife and children. People often sympathize with the personality of this kind of person, although his behavior is not very good. Similarly, his wife lives with four children, and in order to maintain her life, she develops a deep friendship with her boyfriend because of the relationship of finding a job, and even accepts the request of her boyfriend and agrees to marry. She, like the playwright, should also be sympathized with, and her daughter said: [Mother and Doden (that is, her boyfriend) are just very good friends, and mother doesn't care about him]. In addition, when her husband was arrested for the crime of fraud, after a burst of crazy laughter, she said to her new husband: [Today he went to jail, and tomorrow I will marry you! ] Isn't such a painful mood enough to move people? Furthermore, even that person named Doden should be sympathized with, although the director gave him a slight mockery. The remaining four boys and girls, because of their father's misconduct and their mother's remarriage, all deeply hurt their pure hearts, and it goes without saying that they moved people. In almost all the characters, only that woman named Elmer gave people a certain degree of disgust.</p>
<p>Isn't that so? This depicts ordinary life quite deeply. In particular, using a happy tone to write this heavy sorrow is even more touching. However, we don't say it is a comedy (of course, we often call it a tragicomedy). We only need to recognize that this happy and humorous tone allows us to experience the essence of sorrow from the outward form of laughter.</p>
<p>Of course, this film is very dramatic, at least the story is bizarre. In the story structure, the playwright is very careful about the ups and downs of the plot. In addition, the director skipped the not-so-important over-the-top scenes at high speed (if a vulgar writer must insert too much in the stage play performance). What remains on the screen are the parts that describe human relationships. On the one hand, this shows the economy of the script, and the director's grasp of the atmosphere of the play is also very well handled. However, we always feel that the male protagonist's sudden bail from prison and his great success in California inevitably weaken the power of the play. This aspect is the old routine of the American drama [Happy Ending], and on the other hand, it also shows the filmmakers' boasting: the film replaces the drama, and the people who fail on Broadway should come to Hollywood. As for preaching that the male protagonist repents and starts anew, its power is minimal.</p>
<h3>Review of [Tarzan the Ape Man]</h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>Adventures of Tarzan – Paris</p>
<p>This is a beast film pieced together from old films.</p>
<p>Regarding the content analysis of the film [Tarzan the Ape Man], it is originally possible to explain the filmmaker's grasping of the audience's curiosity and the unconscious yearning for primitive life. In addition, it also contains some lucky hopes of getting rich and a kind of retributive fatalism. However, because this film is adapted from old films, as mentioned earlier, the whole film is unusually chaotic and it is not easy for the audience to see its central idea. What is seen on the screen are many fragmentary repetitions, or similar so-called adventure scenes, such as fights between humans and beasts, struggles between humans, and the appearance of wild animals that are not related to the play. Finally, he had no choice but to go beyond the vulgar ending of reunion, and let Tarzan and Jane Porter become a couple, catering to the interests and ideas of the audience.</p>
<p>On such an old film, such an ending is not enough to be deeply criticized in detail, and the so-called new Tarzan film recently still cannot go beyond such a cliché, which is surprising.</p>
<p>Because this film was produced in a period when film technology was not as advanced as it is today, the pictures displayed are much worse in general technical aspects than [Tarzan and His Mate] and [Tarzan the Ape Man]. Also, because this is a silent film, it cannot have as many sound effects as a sound film, which is enough to help the picture to stimulate the audience and increase the terrifying and artistic atmosphere of the picture. Here, it fully proves the inevitability of the decline of silent films. In any case, it cannot compete with sound films.</p>

<h3>Met Too Late (The Age of Innocence) (5)</h3>
<p>— Li Xin</p>
<p>As soon as May stepped into the flower room, she threw herself into Newland's arms like a child seeing her mother, shouting: Oh, Newland, we're back. I told my mother what you and I said! Oh! Baby! Baby! Mother said, since that's the case, let's get married sooner. Newland, let's get married right away! ] When she said this, tears of joy were streaming down her face. She continued and said: [I came all the way here to tell you this good news. I know I can definitely find you here! ! ] Eileen listened to what May and Newland said, and said to May very gently: [I am extremely happy to hear this news. My love, get married soon. The sooner the better! Precious things in life are often ruined by hesitation and suspicion! ! ] May and Newland's wedding date was approaching. After they got married, Newland had to go abroad for their honeymoon. He felt that the scenery of foreign countries, the people of foreign countries, the different things, and the different air could make him forget everything in the past. So the two of them went to Europe. They roamed in various countries such as Italy, Greece, and France for three months! ! He thought that when he returned to the United States in the future, his heart would definitely change, and he would be obedient and unmotivated. Unexpectedly, three months later, when they returned to the United States, everything had not changed, and even he himself was still the same as before. He hated and cursed himself, because as soon as he arrived at the New York dock, his own eyes had unconsciously been searching for Eileen's figure in the crowd. Unfortunately, she did not come to the dock. The next day, he and May ran to Mrs. Minggu's house. Newland pretended to be casual and asked very nonchalantly where Eileen was. Mrs. Minggu said: [She was just here a while ago. I guess she must have gone to the garden for a walk. Go find her. ] Newland listened to Mrs. Minggu's words. He did go to the garden to look for her. He saw her sitting on an orange tree in the distance, and the sunlight was shining on her head. He stood in the distance, unable to breathe for a moment. He carefully looked at all kinds of lovely places on her body. Her drooping hair, her powdered neck, her curved eyebrows, her long, sensitive jade hands... ] He couldn't help shouting: [Eileen...] Eileen immediately stood up and shouted: [Newland! ] Newland sat down next to her, grabbed her jade hand and said; [I always think about and look forward to seeing you... ] So many days... I am afraid that you have already left... Even now that I see you... I can't believe it myself... I am afraid it is still a dream... But, this is too real... ] Eileen slowly retracted her hands and called out: [Newland,] and then remained silent. Her head turned to the side. He could see the tears streaming down her cheeks. He had never seen her cry. He hurriedly comforted her and said: [My baby, don't cry. I won't talk anymore. But, oh, Eileen, getting close to you is like ascending to heaven. If I want to live, Eileen, I don't have to know that you are nearby... Can't I just see you occasionally? What does it matter? Isn't that what we can't do without? ] … But he could no longer go to her house often. Her case was over. If he went often, it would cause suspicion from the outside. But they could still meet in secret often! ! At Mrs. Minggu's house, in the art gallery, and in the museum, they whispered to each other when there was no one around, touched hands, and felt an indescribable heart palpitation all over their bodies, as if they were electrocuted. When no one was paying attention, they flirted with their eyes. They felt ashamed. They hated themselves. But they felt that it was difficult to live without doing so. Months and months passed like this, aimless, disheartened, and secretly apprehensive years were more difficult than anything else. (To be continued)</p>
