<p>時評</p>
<h3>德國國民投票結果感想恒</h3>
<p>據昨日消息。希特勒已以百分之九○之票數。當選爲德國唯一之元首。此種發展。早爲我人所逆料。蓋希氏運動今次之當選。旣無敵黨之競爭。又無本黨其他候選人。投票者復無取捨之餘地。自易集中於彼之一身。加之希黨宣傳。向稱努力。今次之宣傳運動。尤爲興高采烈。無綫電及飛機宣傳之不足。復由無數國社黨員。集隊游行。高唱悲壯之戰歌。以聳動國民之視聽。而迎合其自大好勝之心理。　　此外國社黨員復利用故總統興登堡氏之遺囑。以爲號召國人之絶妙資料。興氏在遺囑中。對希特勒備致頌揚。卽其子在事後亦竭力爲希氏鼓吹。而自稱爲繼續先人之遺志。然世間對於該項遺囑之眞膺問題。仍多猜測。以爲興氏在日。對於政見。向持超然態度。且其人沈默自重。不輕於發言。卽於彼二次出爲總統候選人時。亦未見其有何皇皇大論。何竟於易簣之前。忽有洋洋數千言之遺囑。以爲其舊日之政敵推轂耶。顧國社黨人旣居此遺囑爲奇貨。而從事於宣傳。一般羣衆。不察究竟而輕信其内容者。自然不少也。　　吾人須知德國今日。密探遍布。輿論受制。重要人物之言動。有利於現統治者。固爲希黨宣傳之好資料。其不利於現統治者。不獨無發言之機會。卽偶而發言。亦有被監視拘禁之危險。故凡對於德國現統治之一切批評。在德國早已不能存在。而國外之批評。則亦僅及於國外。不能直達於德人之耳目。以是希黨之政績。優劣善惡。一任希黨之宣傳。有功則自居。有過則諉責於前人。人民日處其蒙蔽播弄中。尚何有價值之可言。　　今希氏已爲德國唯一之領袖矣。其權力將受何種之限制。實爲極可注目之問題。設其權力而受黨之限制。則其獨裁。尚爲國社黨之獨裁。唯按之事實。國社黨爲希氏一手所創造。黨員入黨。須先對希氏個人爲絶對效忠之宣誓。是國社黨員有服從希氏之義務。而希氏固無對黨員負責之必要。以是而論。希氏今後以元首地位而行獨裁。將爲個人之獨裁。雖墨索里尼與斯太林亦將自婉勿如。　　然據昨日消息。此次德國投反對票者仍有四百餘萬。棄權者近二百萬。廢票八十餘萬。合計不滿於希氏者。無慮七百餘萬人。此七百餘萬人。在希黨片面宣傳之環境中。仍能屹然保持其意旨自由。誠爲難能。希氏苟眞能公忠體國。曷勿予此等人以自由批評之機會。以一抒其胸中眞實之見解乎。僑委會擬在</p>

<h3>井内男童無人認領</h3>
<p>武邑城内娑羅巷中段、素有井泉、供居民汲用、惟近以亢旱無雨、井漸乾涸、居民即集資於昨（十九）日開挖、詎於午後繼續開挖時、竟挖出一年年約六七歲之男童、當即撈起、尚有氣息、惟不能言語、又查無家屬認領、附近居民莫不奇異、當即電話報告公安第一分局招尋家屬、一面送往武進醫院救治、南通</p>
<h3>通州棉花即將登市</h3>

<p>本市新聞</p>
<h3>廬山會議結果</h3>
<h3>陳行等昨返滬</h3>
<p>據談　　中外銀價成水平綫　　販運者即無利可圖國聞社云、中央銀行副總裁陳行·業務局總經理席德懋·中國銀行經理貝淞蓀·建設銀公司總經理宋子良·財政部錢幣司長徐可亭·美籍顧問勞克德·林樞·等、承財孔之電召、於上星期六（十八日）下午二時、乘康德飛機、（卽孔部長前次乘往西北之飛機）由虹橋飛機塲、</p>
<h3>飛往牯嶺</h3>
<p>下午五時以前到九江、晚八時到牯嶺下榻、略進晚餐、於九時赴牯嶺五十一號孔氏别墅、對於白銀出口問題、有所討論、十九日晨、並繼續會商、貝淞孫席德懋等、對市塲情形、尤多所貢獻、當經决定、由孔部長</p>
<h3>發表談話</h3>
<p>一篇、交中央社發表、陳行等一行七人、除貝淞孫因須赴中國銀行南昌分行視察外、其餘陳行、席德懋·宋子良·徐可亭·勞克德·林樞·等六人、均於昨（二十）日上午八時、仍乘康德機返滬、上午十一時飛抵虹橋機塲、國聞社記者、於昨日下午、訪陳行氏於中央銀行、承與談</p>
<h3>此行經過</h3>
<p>及牯嶺會議情形如下、陳氏首調、當孔總裁在滬時、每值星期例假、輒召本行重要職員、到其私邸、諮詢各部事務及市面情形、此習以爲常之事也、十八日爲星期六、行務較少、十九日復爲星期例假、故孔總裁電召余（陳氏自稱）與徐司長·席經理·美顧問等、電中並稱能延貝淞孫·宋子良·等君同行更妙、此飛往牯嶺報告行務、藉談</p>
<h3>白銀出口</h3>
<p>問題之前因也、在牯嶺會商者、僅孔財長與上述七人而已、成以爲此行係承蔣委員長之召、此實外間揣測之談、蓋蔣委員長並未參加、查我國貨物入超、各商家咸以現銀付欵、以致</p>
<h3>銀價較低</h3>
<p>今值美國提高銀價、彼投機取巧者、乃以爲有可乘之機、可圖之利、遂不惜大批販運出口、截至今日止、據海關報告、現銀出口之統計、已達</p>
<h3>七千餘萬</h3>
<p>此等物殊情事、實由謡諑所促成、當在牯嶺討論此事時、以爲外傳政府將增加現銀出口税、或禁止白銀出口、其守政府並無此擬議、故卽由孔財長發表談話、藉以安定人民、或以爲我國現銀、長此</p>
<h3>大量流出</h3>
<p>殊足摇動金融市面、此亦非探本之談、蓋販銀出口、以我國銀價較低、有利可圖也、而外商銀行之銀庫、所存中國現銀、一係由華商</p>
<h3>購買美金</h3>
<p>先令之所吸收、一則爲存欵所收入、一旦美金先令所積太多、入超抵付、可以無須再行購買、届時國内銀價、當可與國外者成水平綫、至此則白銀可不至再流出海外、因彼販運、不但</p>
<h3>無利可圖</h3>
<p>且徒增運費水脚之損失、此必然之勢也、故財部認爲並無施行禁令之必要、不過現正研究中外銀價成水平綫之期間問題云云、又據國聞社記者探悉、最近</p>
<h3>中國存銀</h3>
<p>綜計約二十萬萬之譜、至於本市存銀確數、上周爲紋銀九六·五一六·○○○兩、銀元三八八·七四○·○○○元、廠條八·○○六條、去年同時、則爲紋銀一四一·○四○·○○○兩、銀元二七八·八一○·○○○元、廠條六·三六○條、以上爲中外銀行存銀之</p>
<h3>混合數量</h3>
<p>其中存於華商各銀行者、爲紋銀三二·三四○·○○○兩、銀元二四八·九七○·○○○元、廠條七·九八○條、去年同時華商各銀行存銀爲紋銀四九·二七○·○○○兩、銀元一八八·二四○·○○○元、廠條六·○○二條、而外商銀行連日運赴倫敦之現銀、</p>
<h3>仍極活躍</h3>
<p>前（十九）日運出者、約值六七百萬、昨日亦由某銀行以卡車三輛、起運大批現銀、報關出口、昨據關心金融市面者云、出口商人、無論中外、均宜以大局爲前提、顧全市面之安定、不當僅以牟利爲目標長此自相驚擾、掀波助瀾、不但影響社會金融、卽其私人人格與事業、亦將同蒙不利云云、</p>
<h3>王寵惠昨抵滬</h3>
<p>定一二日内晋京並轉贛　　擬往平津小遊明春返歐中央社云、國際法庭法官王寵惠氏、上月月初、由歐請假歸國、過港登岸、轉往東莞原籍一行、業於日前、乘坐大來公司格蘭脱總統號輪離港來滬、昨日午後七時許抵此、王氏定於一二日内晋京、向中央有所報告、然後轉道赴贛、晋謁蔣委員長、並將赴平津小遊、明春返歐銷假、王氏曾於昨日在輪次接見各報社記者、發表重要談話、茲將詳情分紀如下、</p>
<h3>昨日到滬</h3>
<p>王氏於十八日乘坐大來公司格蘭脱總統號輪離港來滬、昨日午後五時許進口、六時許停泊於十六及十七號河筒、王氏與歡迎者稍事週旋、卽行下輪、換乘月寳號小輪渡江、七時許、抵新關碼頭登岸、逕赴海格路範園休息、同來者尚有粤漢路代表李仙根·及廣西大學校長馬君武兩氏、</p>
<h3>歡迎人員</h3>
<p>昨日前往歡迎者、計有司法行政部部長羅文幹代表沈家彝·上海市市長吳鐵城代表唐士暄·中委馬超俊·法次鄭天錫代表郭雲歡·法次石志泉代表向哲濬·市公安局局長文鴻恩·江蘇高等法院院長林彪·首席檢察官胡貽榖·高三分院院長梁士傑·首席檢察官趙士叔·上海地方法院院長沈錫慶·首席檢察官樓英·高二分院首席檢察官王振南·及王氏親友·曁各報社記者四十餘人、分乘公安鏡輝及月寳三小輪渡浦歡迎、</p>
<h3>此後行踪</h3>
<p>據王氏對記者稱、本人此次偕同顧公使返國、抵粤後、因返東莞原籍省視、故過港時卽登岸、並在粤港兩地、晤及陳伯南·胡展堂·諸氏、胡氏對五全大會、將不擬出席、此次北上、係奉蔣委員長電召、故擬在滬作一二日勾留後、卽入京赴贛、晋謁蔣委員長、然後返滬、并擬赴平津作小遊、六個月後再返海牙、今日（卽昨日）抵滬後、擬與在滬各中委會晤、探詢國内情形、因本人出國已久、對於國内情形、不免隔膜、</p>
<h3>國際形勢</h3>
<p>王繼談國際形勢云、國際形勢之變遷、旦夕　變更、非片言隻語所能詳盡、目下國際間各種條約、如九國公約·非戰公約·等、其效力己日漸微薄、實不能嚴束各國行動、所以各國間、一方而互相擴充軍備、一方面兩三國或四五國間互相簽訂不侵犯條約、雙管齊下、少數國家、所以簽訂不侵犯條約、蓋鑒於以前國際條約、較爲複雜故也、王氏並謂、依照目前歐洲情勢而論、世界第二次大戰、不致立卽爆發、蓋各國財力、現未充足、惟戰禍一旦爆發、誰爲仇敵、誰爲盟好、變遷莫測、目前情形、决不能預决將來、</p>
<h3>國聨信仰</h3>
<p>至於歐洲各國、對於國聨之信仰、現仍保持原狀、互相維持、使國聨威信、不致完全淪失、因各國當局、明知不互相維持國聨、則國聨不能存在、而無一相當機關可以代替之、且國聨在昔曾爲各當解决一切糾紛、迭著功勳也、</p>
<h3>日俄糾紛</h3>
<p>王氏繼答記者問曰、日俄間形勢、現雖日趨險惡、但推測戰禍、尚不致立卽爆發、惟兩國軍事準備、甚爲積極也、關於承認（滿洲國）問題、國聨决議案件存在、任何國家、决不甘冒此大不韙、而遭天下人之議論、故信各國决根據國聨决議不承認（滿洲國）到底、至於英國此次組織實業考察團赴東北考察、此舉是否含有政治意味、則不敢决定其究竟、</p>
<h3>外交方針</h3>
<p>記者旋詢王氏以對於我國外交方針之意見、王氏對此不願有所表示、祇謂、外交之方針、須分和戰兩端、决非短時間内所可談及、至於有人主張中國之外交、祗有日内瓦莫斯科及東京三條路可走、本人對此、以爲决非如此簡單所能解决、</p>
<h3>中日糾紛</h3>
<p>關於中日糾紛、王氏表示如中日雙方同意、當可提交國際法庭解决、惟如有一不方表同意、則國際法庭無權裁判、、</p>
<h3>憲草意見</h3>
<p>王氏末謂、立法院草擬之憲法初稿草案、本人祇見報載、詳細條文、尚未睹及、本人對此感到太過滿意、恐將來難於實現云、黄伯樵</p>
<h3>今日放洋考察</h3>
<p>先赴日本再轉歐美　　行期最多八月返國中央社云、京滬滬杭甬鐵路管理局局長黄伯樵、奉鐵道部令、派赴歐美各國、考察鐵道事業、定於今日乘葛蘭德總統號輪出國、中央社記者、特於昨日往記、時黄局長方由平謁顧部長返滬、因啟程在卽、到局召各處署長、囑咐局務、當承撥冗接見、詳談此次考察行程、及該局現况、茲分誌如下、</p>
<h3>考察行程及其範圍</h3>
<p>記者曾訊此次考察行程及範圍、據答稱、原定八月十一日、由上海至天津、經過西比利亞赴歐、并由歐到美、渡日回、嗣聞中東路發生水災鼠疫、遂變更計劃、改定明日（即今日）乘葛蘭德總統號、先到神户、參觀日本鐵道、三十一日乘坎拿大皇后號離横濱、到温哥華上岸、參觀坎拿大鐵道、然後折入美國參觀、九月三十日、從紐約乘德國大郵船勃雷門號、到英國參觀、由英赴歐洲大陸、參觀法意比荷德奥瑞捷克波蘭蘇聨各國鐵道、經西比利亞回國、大槪經歷十四國、爲時最少六個月、最多八個月、至其考察範園、因鐵道事業複雜、每一門類、須有一專家、作長時間之考察、方能得圓滿之結果、故本人此次前往、僅能就本人地位、特别注重鐵道行政管理部份、另由各處署斟酌、備一考察綱要、一部份係普遍徴集參考資料、一部份係就本路平日感覺嚴重之事件、提出問題、希望各國鐵路當局或專家、供給答案、以備討論、但爲時間經濟精神等等關係所限、恐觀察所得、還很膚淺、難以認爲滿足、</p>
<h3>吳副局長奉令暫代</h3>
<p>黄氏繼談、本人此次出國考察、係率派出勤性質、本局設有副局長、局長公出時、依法由副局長代行職務、已由鐵道部明令公布、現任吳副局長紹曾、於交通大學畢業後、在美國留學約十年、得本雪文尼大學鐵道經濟科博士學位、回國任職鐵道部、並任交通大學教授、本人與吳副局長、以前雖不相識、然共事二十個月、對其學問道德及辦專精神、極爲敬佩、平日處理公事、兩人完全一致、故本人雖出國、而局務可照常進行、毫無問題、</p>
<h3>最近重要工作槪况</h3>
<p>記者旋詢黄局長到任後成績、據答、此當聽社會由切實之觀察、作公允之批評、本人對於成績、决不敢自詡、所堪自信者、未嘗一時一刻、不忠實做事而已、但自本人與吳副局長到任以來、有一二點可以數目字表示者、較爲凖確、如還付中英銀公司債欵本息、截至本年七月、共計七百六十八萬元、（内約有一百七十萬、由鐵道部所撥補、）如上年營業計得盈餘三百零一萬元、本年上半年營業、照各站每日進欵電報、計一千零十三萬元、比去年上半年、約增六十七萬元、因此本路債劵、在倫敦市塲、信用甚好、當本人前年十二月到任時、京滬路每百鎊債券、最低僅值四十鎊、滬杭甬路僅值七十七鎊、其後逐漸增高、京滬路漲至六十九鎊、滬杭甬路漲至九十九鎊半、此决非本人或吳副局長一二人之力、乃内外各方一致恊助之結果、現兩路負債總額、滬杭甬路僅三十萬鎊、約三四年即可還清、京滬路未還者、尚有二百八十餘萬鎊之鉅、因能按期撥還、當有清償之日、至京滬路敷設雙軌事、雖屬需要、但爲財力所不許、現擬先從上海到南翔間、敷設一段、一面在相當地段、酌量添設錯車站、及踡綫、以爲補救、上項計畫、最近已得鐵道部批准、正在趕辦、而完成滬杭甬路及建築錢塘江橋等、尚由鐵道部核辦之中、現尚無具體事實、可供報告、</p>
<h3>業務擴充員工增多</h3>
<p>黄局長又談、本局員工人數、總約一萬三千數百、其中工人、約佔百分之九十、此數幾如一平常縣城之户口而其散處之範圍、遠比一縣城爲大、時時刻刻、有死亡進退遷調等變動、故欲在任何一時、得知最凖確之數字、其難不下於地方政府之辦理户籍、惟員司人數較少、較易考核、如自本人到任、至本年七月底爲止、除去警察署總稽核室之人員、其進退不歸局方主持、及鐵道部所派交通大學畢業之實習生外、退職者約有二百八十八人、統共每月薪資額四萬三千元、新進者二百七十人、統共每月薪資二萬九千元、論人數、减少十八人、論薪額、每月减少一萬三千元、但是上項數目、現已有變動、同時看一年八個月來之工作、姑就内部之加重不計、只論新開辦之事業、如鐵路營業所新設三處、鐵路花園飯店新設一處、鐵路醫院診所新加三處、而首都鐵路輪渡、則實行通車、全國各路、則實行負責聨運、可見事業加多、而員司尚未加多、但車務外勤人員、已感缺乏、不久首都中央車站、以及和平路接軌落成、淞滬綫通至上海市中心區之三民路支綫落成、上面所説上海南翔間雙軌等落成、再在最近之將來、錢塘江橋落成、滬杭甬全綫落成、亦在在需要充分助手、而更宜於事先預爲造就、故最的富務處、考取一批五十名之見習生、此外工人部份、則略有增加、均係辦理負責運輸·及聨運後所添之車務工人等、係出於實際需要、本人以爲本路人數、果然甚多、但係歷年繼續加添、非一朝一夕所致、有鐵路乃國營企業、可以生産、故欲謀發展、不在消極的裁員减政、而在積極的擴展業務、調整員工、使人盡其長、縱談至此、黄局並出示各種報告及統計、以爲印證、</p>
<h3>重建局所及設倉庫</h3>
<p>黄局長又談、本局局所、原在上海北站、自燬於一二八事變後、租屋辦公、月納巨額租金、殊不經濟、現擬就站東之地·重建九層局所一處、其經費業經指定、已進行規劃、期於兩年内完成之、現更奉部令、在沿綫各站、建築倉庫、以利貨運、蓋現有各站貨倉、設備簡陋、僅用以蔽風雨而已、局方奉令後、即組織考察團、與金融界合作、赴各地調查、緣倉庫之設備、旣以貨品之性質而異、其容積更須視産額之多少而定、故其於産銷運均有直接關係、將就實地調查結果、始能决定建造及其容積等、將來興建、或由金融界投資、或由局借欵自辦、尚未預定、前傳接洽借欵、已與銀行界商定、則係訛傳云、</p>
<h3>夙疾未瘳順訪醫治</h3>
<p>黄局長此次出國、僅偕其夫人及秘書羅逸民同行、據黄氏談、渠夙患糖尿病、飲食須有人料量、上年以來、右肩骱舉動疼痛、衣着常須人帮助、故不能不約内子同行、然考察旅費僅一萬元、故經費方面、頗爲竭蹶、秘書羅逸民博士係奥人、現任吾國交通大學外國語教授、羅博士除德文外、並通中·日·及英·法·意·語文、而本人則僅能操德語、爲考察之便利計、故呈准鐵道部、飭由黎校長借調同行、但其任務、僅爲傳譯及料理文書而已、已謂本人每到天氣暖熱時、身體必較好、故現在出國、尚可敷衍、惟宿疾未瘳、且因此使目力大减、將來或有失明之虞、故此次出國、擬順訪著名醫師醫治云、</p>
<h3>蔡增基由京返</h3>
<p>此行與徴菸酒牌照税無關中央社云、本市財政局局長蔡增基、日前因事晋京、業經返滬、據該局負責人談、日昨報載本市因取銷船捐、收入减少、須另謀補救、又對於菸酒牌照税决意重征、以期逐漸肅清云云、並非確詞、蓋蔡局長此次晋京、係奉市府令派、出席某項會議、與征收菸酒牌照税事無關、取銷船捐一節、亦並非事實、上項新聞、顯係一種希圖抗税有作用之宣傳、至關於征收菸酒牌照税問題、本局主張、曾迭在報上發表、社會人士、多已明瞭、此次接征該項税欵、僅係遵照部頒章則、核實征收、並非加税、其有不遵辦者、當依據章則、嚴厲罰辦、以後倘再有人故爲妨碍税政之宣傳、定予查究云、曾養甫來滬</p>

<h3>曾氏來滬接洽抵押</h3>
<p>該省建設廳長曾養甫氏、特爲此事、於昨日由杭來滬、向本市銀行界接洽抵押或發行辦法、據銀行界表示、浙江省政府發行鉅額地方整理公債之事、銀行界對此、因數額過鉅、非一二家銀行、所能單獨承受、故無論發行、或抵押現欵、尚須經同業洽商後决定、且該項公債條例、尚在立法院審核中、實現尚需時日云、</p>
<h3>將晋京向中央陳述</h3>
<p>曾氏向銀行界接洽完畢、卽須轉道晋京、向中央有所陳述、大致爲該省辦理工賑計劃、正在根據蔣委員長指示方針、逐步進行、旣極支絀、而本年夏季、天時亢旱、又復宿增巨災、發行省公債一事、實屬迫不容緩、爲使浙省被災嚴重、及税收短絀、財政困難情形、俾獲中央深切瞭解及恊助、務使該項公債之發行、能順利通過、早日發行、則民間得早日解除痛苦、曾氏此行、實負重大之使命云、</p>

<h3>棉産豐收預測</h3>
<p>産量較往年增加四成　　美棉上市新花受影響本年自全國經濟委員會棉業統制會散發棉籽、各地植棉、遂較往年爲多、據棉業界推測、新花行將登塲、今年可較去年增收百分之四十、茲將探得各情分誌如下、　　各地情形本年夏季、雖天時亢旱、因棉花需水無多、故各地植棉、未蒙若何影響、據棉統會調查、江蘇·河南·江西·河北·各省植棉區域、情况均佳、浙屬各地、每年産量甚少、本年情形、雖較往年稍遜、但於總産數上並無影響、至於收獲時間、早者下月中旬即可登塲、遲則下月底十月初亦可採摘、收獲之遲早、須視各地水土情形也、　　産量倍增據棉業界表示、本年所植之棉、天時頗稱適宜、故未遭損失、且暴雨不多、故棉苗開花時、並未受吹折、故結實織細、頗合紡二等細紗之用、其中尤以美國棉種花身最佳、將來足以减少印度棉之進口、因全國各地棉花、在十年前可産二千萬擔左右、近年來因農村衰落、及商人壟斷、農人對於植棉殊少興趣、同時因不加改進、故産量日少、兩年來之估計、二十一年全國産量爲八百萬擔左右、二十二年爲八百五十萬擔左右、較之以前减少百分之六十、本年份經棉統會之設法改進、及發放美棉種籽、産量隨之增加、據一般預料、僅以陜省而言、可增收一倍、本年全國總産額在一千一百萬擔以上、故較去年增加百分之四十云、　　美棉影響我國紗廠、除採用本國棉花外、尚須購買印棉及美棉紡細紗、因本國棉不宜以紡細紗、三十支左右須用印棉、三十支以上五十支以上須用美棉今年棉産收獲可望增多、織絨細厚、故棉紗界預料、印度棉本年可望减少進口、又悉政府向美國所貸之棉麥、其麥粉已由麵粉廠商承購外、至美棉則紗業無意購買、倘此項美棉入市塲後、新花必受影響云、日俄戰謡中</p>

<h3>第二十三期</h3>
<p>目錄　　（一）自己看不見進步　　（二）外埠讀者通信用錢變通辦法　　（三）徴求讀書生活縮寫</p>
<h3>自己看不見進步</h3>
<p>在許多讀書報告中，都説到自己没有進步。有的在慨嘆，有的在自恨，同時也有帶着幾分謙虚氣氛的。我們姑不論寫報告的人是在那一種心情下着筆，但這種現象我們却不能完全視爲不重要，不作一番合理的解釋。　　讀書要求進步是一般的心理，不進步幹嗎還要讀書呢？不過，讀書的人往往過於躁進，把學問看得太容易。我們祇要看書坊裏有什麽英文百日通之類的滑頭書出現，就明白可以看見社會上原來有一種讀書的僥倖心，投機心存在。固然躁進不一定是投機心理，却與投機心理多少保有一點關聨。至少我們可以説，希望過急的心理是不明白讀書的過程，不把進步在過程中去了解。　　然則，所謂讀書的過程是什麽呢？讀書的過程就是假定從某一學科某一門爲起點而到達預定的終點之謂。在這二點之間，我們的知識天天在增長，開展。舊的謬誤的不正確的槪念，天天在糾正，新的正確的槪念天天在培養。這種進程往往是很徐緩的，有時連自己都看不見，所以我們常聽見人們説，（自己看不見進步）。這話有一半的眞實。自己看不見進步，就是無進步麽？不！不是這樣的。這種現象特别在技術的訓練是如此。譬如，過去的臨碑描帖，不僅今天寫的字與昨天寫的字看不見進步，即與早幾月寫的拿來一比有時亦不能説出進步的所以然來。繪畫也是同一的現象，在學習科學方面，也常常如此。如研究社會科學，自已雖然讀書不少，只覺得什麽都知道一點，一追問起來，不免是什麽也不知道，至於應用，那自然是更不能了。這是什麽原故呢？這就是没有進步麽？看不見進步麽？不是的。原來進步的是積累的，不達到量的方面的飽和是不會變質的。進步是贊的表現，同時又可促成量的增大。由量變質的變化，往往要經過徐緩的過程，不到某種程度是不會變化的。所以，在目已看來是無進步的時候，正是你在進步，你天天在進步。一個成名的文學家，他在成各之前，往往自己不能看出自己的才能，不能自信，何來可以受世人的歡迎，也就是他還在創造自己的過程中，固爲這過程是艱辛而又徐緩的，有時不獨失了自信，甚至於煩急，失望。這是很常有的事實，不足爲怪。　　躁急有時就是打胎，因爲母體内的嬰孩，並未達到十月的懷胎期，就早於二三月養出了。這嬰孩必然是一個未長成的死物，不是活的孩子。我們尊重埋頭苦幹，不計成敗的人，就等於尊重母親們一樣，不計成敗，不是眞的不計較，是能在過程中忍耐，這猶如做母親的十月受苦，爲的是養育自己的孩子。　　但是，讀書的進步就没有突然的表現的現象麽？我答道，也是有的。讀書到底不是生孩子，上面的譬如祇能説明一面，不能説明全體。所謂突然的跳躍，在讀書中也與在自然現象與社會其他現象一樣，都是存在的。譬如，在思想的理解上，在認識上，常常因社會大的事變而呈飛躍，不必經過很長的過程，在讀文學書時，常因自己生活變化，突然對於某一作家特别了解。諸如此類的事很多。　　但是，人的行動是意識的。讀書雖然不必躁進，但不是説讓它像烏龜似的慢慢爬，我們仍應以一切努力縮短達到進步的過程。要如此，纔可説是科學的讀書觀。　　（二）重要通告</p>
<h3>外埠讀者通信用箋變通辦法</h3>
<p>本部爲便於統計和保存讀者來信計，已製有一種（讀者通信箋），已於八月一日起不分本埠外埠的讀者一律改用。現在因爲該項信箋的郵寄，發生很大的困難了。按照郵局的定章，信箋不能作印刷品寄，要改裝包裹，於是一本信箋，定價僅只大洋二角，寄往外省却須四角寄費，本省内亦要二角。這與我們一向體惜讀者的經濟擔負信箋只收成本費的原則大大衝突。現在特爲改變辦法，凡外埠已在本部登記的</p>
<p>讀者，如能購用該項信箋，自然更好，但一次可購三本，寄費仍是四角。凡未在本部登記，或經濟能力負擔不起的，可暫改用普通稿紙，在每次通信時，書明通信次數，登記説號碼，通信處，所詢問題的性質各項。本埠讀者請一律到本館收費處購買！　　（三）徴求讀書生活縮寫　　我們極想知道各色各樣職業的讀者，將自己的讀書生活寫成五百到一千字的短文，寄給我們，在本刊上發表。但文章着重在各人特殊生活部分，凡是一般的現象，可以從略。我們以爲這是了解生活最最重要的一種知識的交通。希望熱心的朋友，快快動手罷！　　附帶聲明一句，凡（讀書問答）内發表的信及本刊上發表的一切文字，都是志同道合的人，無條件的供給的，一槪没有稿費。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>時間性</h3>
<p>— 藩</p>
<p>昔者，竊聞之，孔子，聖之時者也。暑天揮扇，冬天圍爐，是合乎時令的。夏天圍爐，驚的汗下　如雨，或冬天在北風里揮着芭蕉扇，這人至少有些兒瘋狂，什麽事都錯亂了。——孔夫子的長處，是在這里。</p>
<p>要人之尊孔，讀經，所尊當非孔子本意。譬如恢復古樂，孔子復生，一定聽不入耳了。儒林外史里馬二先生以爲（孔子設若生在而今），怎樣怎樣，更設想馬二（生在而今），一定以爲孔子將坐飛機而小天下，看電影而三月不知肉味了。因爲他是（時者也）的緣故。</p>
<p>但古今雜糅，中西并進，不但錯亂，更要勞而無功。那是圍爐又揮扇，一會兒酷暑一會兒嚴寒。（治國）者總喜歡自比爲醫生，但醫生同時寒熱的藥并投，是不見得有裨病者的。</p>
<p>無論朝野的人物們的理論，近來又非常錯亂了，這方説和平，那方説也是和平，這方説自由不存在，那方説自由也不存在。這方面説重事實不尚空談那方面也重事實不尚空談。那麽豈不是（一道同風），（共赴國難）了麽？然而明明是一方面是爭自由，一方面是不要自由，一面要和平，一面不要和平，一面不許空談，一面不能空談，氣候彼此有寒熱温凉之不同的。湯頭是一個名色，藥劑是兩種不同，對于病人的診斷和擺架子，又是一致的。——這就呌錯亂。</p>
<p>用這種標準遠看列强大勢，近看當代人物，是可看得出幾成道理的。——嗚呼！世界上的愚人和儍子也還没有死盡也歟！孔子之徒也？</p>
<h3>幹點切實的工作</h3>
<p>— 猛克</p>
<p>（大衆語）的問題眞是討論得長久了，然而討論自管討論，問題却依然如故。看目下的情形，論戰者也都顯出疲勞的神色，照這樣下去，恐怕不久就要風平浪靜的。我想，這問題的結論，是只好讓實踐的效果來下，要這問題有結論，我們就得到大衆中去實踐。</p>
<p>現在已經有人在要求（拿貨色來看），這是不好説他們不該的。自然，現在的問題旣正在討論，完全的（大衆語）無從拿出來，但我們何嘗不可以暫且取那比較普通的言語，做些淺顯的文字，利用現在爲大衆所習慣，所愛好的讀物的題材和方式，到大衆中去試騐一下呢？現在的大衆的中心讀物，其實還是三國志，水滸一類的舊小説，我們不妨將其内容和文字變革，出版同樣的題材和方式的新三國志，新水滸一類的小册子，發給街頭上的書販子云出售。然後從這實踐的經騐和教訓中，再去改革，豐富我們的文字，使它更加接近大衆，與大衆的實生活聨系，將來大衆對於我們的東西讀的多了，那便是我們的勝利，也可以説就是（大衆語）走上了完成的道路吧。另一方面，我們還要有多種所謂（通俗）的刊物（最好是周刊），分給書販子發行，内容以描寫和紀錄大衆的實生活爲主，多設通訊，問答欄，並且徴求大衆自己的寫作，以訓練眞正的大衆作家。現在市上有一種呌做連環）的兩周刊，性質是這樣的，但有點像（新生），仍不少高深的議論和五四式的白話，非有中學程度的人不能看，它也還要（通俗）一些才行的。</p>
<p>這種工作也許很艱難吧，開頭就要有資本。但我想，出版（通俗）的小册子和刊物，總不見得會比别種書籍雜誌的銷路壞些，只要有人去幹，書店也未必不肯承印的。這次參加（大衆語）討論的諸先生，與書店有關係的並不少，我希望熱心的諸位，不要忽略了這些事才好。</p>
<h3>賣凉粉的</h3>
<p>— 至德</p>
<p>這一天，天上一絲兒雲彩都没有，青的越發乾凈了。</p>
<p>在頭上，蔚藍的天空，掛着暴烈的太陽。當從大地上升起來的時候，一切就彷彿被關閉在蒸籠里似的，窒塞地喘着氣。在龜裂了的赤土上，薰蒸着令人暈眩的熱氣，薰風吹拂起倒垂下去的樹木枝葉，宛如酗醉的酒漢，摇晃着那扭歪着的腦袋。小溪里的流水也因之乾涸許久了。至於田野的青苗，在先——溪里還流水時，雖曾經過人力的澆灌，但幾天來，遭受了這更加酷暴的陽光的灼炙後，終於是怪可憐地，枯萎到奄奄一息的地步了。</p>
<p>現在，在這里已經是二十多天没見個雨星兒了。前些天，——當旱象剛現的時節——這里的人們，也曾用着虔誠的信心，貫注着全付的精神，而設壇拈香，祈神祝雨；滿望以大衆的虔敬來換得甘霖，以救荒解熱。——然而，結果却是糟透了。這麽些天，不但總没有落個雨滴，天氣反來一天倒比一天地枯燥起來。因爲這樣一般鄉愚們的（精神）和（信心），便再無所寄託；那麽，在這溽暑的淫威下，他們就祗有悶在自己家里，仰天嘆氣，或望空埋怨（天意而已。</p>
<p>彷彿死了一樣的沉寂，陰鬱的氛圍籠罩住這個村子。</p>
<p>在這天的正晌午。從村口傅過這麽一響呌賣聲：</p>
<p>——凉粉………咯！嗓調是嘶啞的。王順子，一個三十多歲的漢子；然而却是枯瘦憔悴，大槪是爲什麽癆病苦惱着的。他推着凉粉車子，從那邊蹣跚地走過來。</p>
<p>——凉粉，凉粉咯！………………走進村裏，他並没稍停地一面走着，一面呌着。及至繞了兩圈兒；可是，不但没曾發利市，就是連個打邏的差兒也没有碰着。而且這時候，因爲疊連地呌喚，他覺着咽喉裏就彷彿有塊熱烘烘的火熖在燃燒。毒辣的陽光曬到那多角的，變得黑蒼蒼了的皮膚上，猶如針炙般的難受。汗水如雨注般流，…………整個褲子全是水漉燒的，儼然像個剛水的水鷄的樣子。</p>
<p>——多熱的天呀！他仰望天空喃喃地説。隨後又貪婪地環顧了四周：這裏，那裏，是一片沉寂；除開樹梢囂耳而單調的蟬呌外，别的都沉默着没一點聲息。</p>
<p>——唉！接着，他又嘆了一口氣。同時，他希望能找個凉爽些的樹蔭歇會子。</p>
<p>然而，忽然有一種苦痛的情緒擁上他的心頭。他想起現在的錢兜裹仍然是（空空如也）的；滿罐子的凉粉，在那會子就開始有了些酸味氣；因之，不禁地又立刻憶起了這凉粉是怎麽來的了——是自己老婆僅有的一條褲子換來的！</p>
<p>於是，在他的眼前就又呈顯了兩個——兩個爲他所不願看見，但又是每天非見不可的影像：一個是脱得渾身精光，赤裸着身子的女人，他的老婆；另一個就是黄瘦得僅剩下一把骨頭，雖説已經六歲了，可是因爲飢餓却走路都不會走的孩子——但他的孩子，也會兩眼含滿涙水，朝他匍匐過來；一面掀動着乏力的嘴唇説——爹，餓，餓呀！啼哭起來…………………</p>
<p>這種凄慘的情境，如一把鋭利的鋒刃洞穿了他的心臟般的，使他抖動起來了。——所以，他再没有勇氣去希圖自己的爽快，而停下車子；祗是吞下兩口酸滴滴的水，稍解心燥後，便又咬緊牙關掙扎着推動車子，呌賣着：凉粉咯！和那赤熱的炎陽來搏鬥。…………</p>
<p>不過，這一次他繼續了還不到半點鐘吧。最先，嘶啞的聲嗓變做了笛鳴也似的低音：脚下受赤土的炙燙薩腫起了滿滿的瘤泡；再踏到熱土上，簡直是步步難挨。</p>
<p>再下去，就是他的腦袋感覺眩暈，重漲，像突增了幾倍似的厲害痛楚地起來。然而，最使他受不了的，却是那剛嚥下的幾口酸水，現在竟在他的空肚子里咕咕作怪，勾引起極度飢餓的火燄來。！他已經三天多没有吃過飯了。</p>
<p>這樣，由於熱，餓交織地襲擊，於是他的心頓呈了厲害的慌亂狀態，眼睛里似乎有無數的火星向外迸裂，渾身上下也就像因寒慄而猛烈地痙攀抽動起來……漸漸地，沉重的脚步托不動了那沉動的身體，抖動的手肢也把握不住那小車子了。！最後，他終於連人帶車地傾倒在路旁。</p>
<p>然而，就在這瞬間，那兩個令他難堪的影像，仍然緊抓在他的心頭。</p>
<p>六月的太陽，赤熱，毒辣，酷暴，也恰像一面灰色的網，籠罩住的村子，遂變得寂靜，沉鬱，只是樹頭蟬呌唯一的點綴着。此外，還有成羣的蒼蠅哼哼地，興高采烈地圍釘一塊僵屍一那是王順子的殘軀。</p>
<h3>給一個孩子</h3>
<p>— 甘永桕</p>
<p>吹着醺醚的風的這八月的黄昏，菊花和晚荷是悄悄地萎了；孩子，你領着這最後約遲暗，寂寂地爬進黑的紗中：你的小眼是悵然地凝着的，——在惋羨那未盡的前程嗎，抑哀思着消失在（河伯）的暴戾的父母？是呵，你一定也在念着：茅屋前的黄昏的鬱金香，與龐大的木柏的陰影和夜眠的羞菊與結在濕土裏的野茲子。你的小手捲屈着，怕是在試操那祖父和父親都曾握過的鋤鍬吧？而你的小小的腕力也是預備分擔母親的一份勞作的。但你現在是不行了，呵，我可憐的孩子！你的小小的殞屍令我心傷，我祈禱着：（時間呵，讓我永存這記憶！）</p>
<h3>黄包車？</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>老人（九）</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>像他自己呢，雖然一向是遠離鄉井在異地經商，却也是俄羅斯大帝國的好公民。三年兩年之間他就要回到他的祖國的懷抱之中一次，在那裏，他感覺着一切的温煖與快慰，那一望無垠的原野，和飄在原野上的風，載了花的香氣，草的香氣，還有土壤的香氣，像是給他重生的力量，蘇息他遠年在人生途上的困頓。他看着那些豪華的貴族和大地主，但是他從來没有一點怨憤，在他們的驕佚的生活中使他看到了更大的世界，而且他以爲，他們的享受是一件十分公允的事。但是那些亂黨毁了一切，又使他失去了再踏上故土的機緣。他獨自咀咒着，（有和他同一的遭遇的友人來了，便一同怒駡着），他發誓不張開眼睛去看那些叛者的逆行；但是時時地他却想起了那原野，在原野上飄着的風，還有捲在那風裏的香氣。他懷戀着。低下頭去，用無盡的詛駡洩着在胸中激蕩的怨憤。甚至於有着大的企圖，想到了自己的年歲，就又把那雄心消滅下去。他自己絶望地想着！（在我和死亡相遇之前，將永遠不能回到我的故土了！）</p>
<p>在這一陣沉默之中，他們是各自低下了頭，好像這是將無窮盡的下去，誰也不知道説一句什麽話纔好。最後，却是他的一聲大的嘆息，纔驚醒這凝住了的境况，各自記起來是該有點什麽話説下去的。</p>
<p>挺了挺身子，揚着兩隻粗肥的手臂，阿力賽恣意地打着呵欠。然後擦去了從眼睛裏擠出來的涙水，突然間像想起來什麽十分重大的事件似地從坐位上站起來。</p>
<p>（老爹，我有點東西帶給你的。）</p>
<p>他一面説着，一面把那肥胖的手在衣袋裏尋着，他像是很興奮，但是他失敗了，在衣袋之中他什麽也没有拿出來。</p>
<p>看見了他像是漠不關心地坐在那裏，他就説：</p>
<p>（那是關於沙夏的——）</p>
<p>這可引起他的注意了，他立刻問着是怎麽一回事，是不是有什麽信帶了來？再三地要亞利賽仔細地找一過，他用低一點的聲音説着，他是願意知道一點沙夏的消息的。</p>
<p>爲着搜尋，亞利賽的頭上竟有着汗珠，（這不是因爲因工作而出的汗，却是氣急纔出來的。）他把衣袋的底層幾乎都翻轉來，把那裏面的手帕，餞袋紙烟之類都拿了出來量是他還是没有找到，漲紅的臉，突起的青筋，如牛一樣地喘氣，使得阿克棠衣諾夫老爹也覺着十分過意不去，雖然心中更迫切地想知道關於沙夏的消息，却也這樣説着。</p>
<p>（坐下歇歇罷，也許忘記帶了來，没有什麽關係，我是不在乎的，唉沙夏那個孩子，也不是一個聽話的好孩子。）</p>
<p>亞利賽覺得十分抱歉地，摇着頭，用手絹擦着臉上的汗，他是預備坐下去了，可是突然間引起他的記憶，就用手在長褲的後面的袋裹，摸出一張剪得不十分整齊的一方印刷品。</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第一回　鬼載一車關中來速客家徒四壁渡口吊秦人</p>
<p>潼西公路，由潼關縣的西關外，開始向西發展。在平原上，遠遠看到一叢黄霧，捲起兩三丈高，滾滾向西而去，這便是在路上飛跑的汽車捲起來的路面浮土。路上的塵土，終日的捲着黄霧飛騰起來，那便是暗暗的告訴我們，由東方來的汽車，一天比一天加多。這些車子，有美國來的，有德國來的，也有法國或其他國中來的。車子上所載的人，雖然百分之九十九是同胞，但是載進口的貨，國貨差不多和人成了反比例，是百分之一二。那些貨大槪是日本來的，英國來的，或者美國俄國來的。總而言之，十分之八九，是外國來的。這種趨勢，和潼西公路展長了那段西關公路，將來還要展長一段蘭迪公路一樣，是有加無已的。這公路上，有輛德國車子，開着每小時三十個買爾的速度，捲起黄土，向前飛奔。這車子和公路上其他車子一樣，是人貨兩用的。司機坐位上，坐了一個司機，和兩個德國人，那是特等包廂。後身是載貨車身，車上堆了幾十箱汽油，汽油箱上堆了箱子，網籃，行軍床，甚至乎裝上幾百瓶啤酒的大木板箱子，層層疊起，堆成了個小山巴。這貨物堆上，坐着四個人，都是同胞，兩個是天津人，是和前面那兩個德國人當伙計的。他們很熱心他們的職務，帮着德國人發展商業。一個呌趙國富，一個呌王老五。還有兩個人，一位是浙江人，到陜西來找工作的，却没有指定要幹何事。他呌張介夫。一個是江蘇人，説一口上海話，是來想辦税務捐局一類差事的，他呌李士廉。（一）</p>
<h3>旱</h3>
<p>— 黄意平</p>
<p>天皇爺老不下雨，總得把窮人活活兒的一個一個的治死了才罷！不是嗎？這村子上：睡倒的睡倒，做死的做死，已壞了多少人了哪？！</p>
<p>前兒不算，就只眼前，我們東村；有張老爹，老順叔，阿金，田官，小玉子跟他爸……這許多人！娘兒們畢竟單弱，倒的也多：有森泉嫂，阿翠姐，李家嫂子，銀姑兒姊妹，和遥頭媽媽的兩個媳婦……還不止此數；有一家睡倒一個的，有一家睡倒兩個三個的，一時也説不全；前後村，西村，更没算在裏面，已有這麽許多人！</p>
<p>做死的更多；也算不清！</p>
<p>前天，前村一衆十二個人戽水：内中四個人，因田活忙，實做不過來；常白日黑夜的幹着。好幾天没得好睡好吃白；就當塲的從車軸上跌下暈了！結果：三個全死，只救活了一個！</p>
<p>昨天，西村聽説也壞了兩個婆子，都是從車軸上扔下就完結了的。</p>
<p>我們這里小春的媽！一個三十歲的小寡孀：礦丈夫才在前年去世。家裏有一個七十歲瞎眼的婆婆，守着兩個孩子：一個三歲，一個五歲，全仗伊一人做出養活。不料一月來：耘稻，戽水，天又熱！人手又少！不做没的吃，只是挨着，做過了力，當塲耘耘稻，就跪在田裏死了！人還不知；後來有人見伊一逕垂倒了頭，兀自不動！去呌呌伊，又推推伊，不道早已氣絶身死了！</p>
<p>因没錢，前天死了的，現在還擱着没有出材。</p>
<p>可憐見兒的！一家子大哭小喊，閒人見了也傷心！</p>
<p>老天爺！不知佨多𠴰才賜給我們一回大雨？救救我們苦人呢！</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （眞）</p>
<p>王先生此次赴日本，不知所爲何事？據他自己所記；在日備受該國朝野的歡迎。到處鳴砲撞鐘，如迎帝王，如禮菩薩，足見中國名流，畢竟不凡。料想上海一二八之役，項松茂先生以下若干千若干萬人，長眠在九泉之下，瞧着王老生得意歸來，定將嘖嘖相語道：（好不眼熱煞人也麽哥！）</p>
<h3>街頭音樂師</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>街頭音樂師，他每天在黄昏的時候，掮了兩個青布囊，一個掛在胸前，一個垂在背後，囊裏揷了許多笛，簫·二胡·京胡之類，手裏也拿着一隻京胡，理一理絃綫，按着曲拍，拉出許多戲曲來，沿着街，邊拉邊行。拉膩了，又換支笛來吹，他是一個萬能的音樂師。</p>
<p>街的兩旁，常有許多納凉的人閒談着，他們多半是戲迷，聽得音樂師的京胡聲，自遠而來，便緊跟着曲調，哼着：（我好比，籠中鳥……）。直到音樂師走遠了，京胡聲聽不到了，他們還是哼個不住。</p>
<p>音樂師每天出來，是出售這些樂器的，如果有人去招顧他，他還要很道地的來教導你。</p>
<p>有一天，我向他買支笛，給他兩毛大洋，要他找我十六個銅子，可是他在袋裏摸索了好久，摸不出來，縐着眉向找説：（找不出）。</p>
<p>（唉！這種清苦的營生，跑了老半天，能做到幾個錢！）他自言自語着，一面又使勁的拉着（桑園寄子）的一段，揚長而去。</p>

<h3>西瓜燈</h3>
<p>— 沉琴</p>
<p>西瓜是消暑解渴的唯一妙品，它的表皮是花翠的；瓤是有紅有黄；汁液很甜美的，眞個是色香味三者俱有的。</p>
<p>記得我幼年時候，常常揀着渾圓花翠的瓜，頂上開個小孔，剜去了瓤，而留下的皮很薄，薄很差不多透明的了，於是再用小刀在外皮上刻了許多人物，山水，花卉等花紋，中間點上蠟燭，掛在窗口，倒是一盞清凉燈。</p>
<p>我又想起一段故事來，我小時候夏夜納凉，伯父總講許多故事，有一次他説：</p>
<p>（清同治是很愛聲色的，一個夏夜他在御花園中納凉，左右獻上瓜來，不知怎樣一來，引起了他的興趣，便下諭給妃子們，大家回去做西瓜燈，明天拿來比巧，那一個奪得錦標，當然有珍貴的東西賞賜。果然，明天的晚上，在御花園裏有這樣的盛舉，燈天燈地的，全是西瓜雕鏤成的，頓時變成了一片瓜燈世界，在賞評之下，其中以蓮華妃子獻上的一盞燈，刻着瀟湘館春困幽情圖：館的窗口，在垂簾裏，隠隠約約地看出林黛玉嬌困的恣態，工夫的細緻，眞使同治帝喜躍起來，立刻，伊得了最上品的賞，是個翡翠的西瓜；是天然的，不是人造的），</p>
<p>啊，這有名的至寳，不知現在還存在嗎？也許是在八國聨軍攻入時帶走了吧？誰知道呀？</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我敢説太后是永遠不會想到伊這個（斷絶交通）的禁令，將與他人以何種的影響的；卽使想到，伊也必認爲這是理所當有的事情，决不因此發生什麽憐念或不安的感覺。</p>
<p>火車到豐台站便停下了，我從車窗裏面望出去，却不見有一個閑人。據我所知道，這地方原是很熱閙的，但現在竟變得像荒漠一樣的靜寂了，連一些聲音教聽不見；我不由不佩服這些地方官的才幹和魄力，他們爲迎合太后起見，無論怎樣嚴酷的手段，都會施展出來的。可是那一班被嚴禁着不許走近車站，甚至不許隨便向我們這列御用火車看一眼的民衆，對於太后這一次在這裏經過的事實，將作什麽感想呢？怕是誰也不會注意的。依我猜測起來，他們必然是懷着一腔特殊的緊張的情緒，在懸想眞以爲是呵護他們的天老爺，在這裏經過了。本來，皇帝原有（天子）之稱，那末，皇太后和天老爺當然也有相當的關係；就算伊是代表天老爺的，亦無不可，反正伊的權威也着實不輸於天老爺！</p>
<p>因爲這時候還在春季中的緣故，白河的名産－鯽魚，恰好成爲一種最合時令的禮品。所以當我們的車子從北京開出的當兒，這裏附近一帶的官員，都正在不惜重金的搜購才出水的鯽魚，以供太后佐膳。及至車到豐台，好幾尾才出水的大鯽魚，便用很精緻的東西盛着，經過了一番極腐化的禮節，鄭重其事的獻上來了。可是這些官員雖已如此的小心侍奉，而太后却像没有知道的一樣。理由是豐台附近一帶的官員，都是些微末前程，名姓不見經傳的脚色，根本還趕不上和太后見面咧！（一一○）</p>
<p>游踪所至</p>
<h3>濟南大明湖</h3>
<p>— （祝融氏）</p>
<p>濟南一地，是包圍在羣山之中，成了個盆形，因了四郊是山的緣故，濟南城内城外的泉水，是特别的多，最著名的，自然是省署内的珍珠泉，和城内的趵突泉了。在濟南一區，共有七十二個泉水。而且不論是那一處地方，祇要在濟同，掘地五尺，便可以得到泉水，可算得是泉水最多的地方了。不但是泉水多，因了水的聚積，還匯成了一個大明湖，成了濟南的一處名勝，大明湖的位置，一半是在城外，一半却在城内，面積並不廣闊，只有數十畝的大小，深度祇有五六尺光景，水却清冽得同趵突珍珠泉等不差什麽。不論是誰，到了濟南，總得坐着遊舫，在大明湖内盪漾一回，可以消去一路所受的煩困，尤其是夏天，儘是濟南城内商埠，熱到一百多度，而一到了大明湖中，立刻暑氣全消，不忍離開，又加省湖水泡的龍井，味甘而冽，眞是一抓在手，兩脇生風，决計想不到在黄沙遍地的濟南府中，有這麽一個消夏勝地。</p>
<p>最奇怪的，便是大明湖的遊舫，並不以西湖和瘦西湖秦淮河畫舫一般的精美，最使你驚奇的，是没有船尾和行船主要的櫓槳，好似是尋常船的一半，只有船頭和船艙。船艙上面，搭着白布的凉藡，放着一張籐桌，幾張籐椅，船頭之上，却可憐得一無所有，只矗立着一支長有丈餘似鋼又般的樹枝，這便是船家作爲行舟的唯一篙子。在没有遊過大明湖的人，見了這簡陋的游舫，和奇怪的樹枝，便得使你遊湖的興緻，去了一半，可是撑進了湖的中間，細細的點了湖水泡的龍井，竟可以使你不再想到名聞天下的西湖畫舫，更不用談到揚州瘦西湖和南京的秦淮河了。</p>
<h3>青島棧橋</h3>
<p>— （湯成年）</p>
<p>望海邊走在中山路的盡處，便有一條長蛇般的水門汀築成的長橋，由海邊直揷向海中，那就是青島的棧橋了。别處的橋，都是架在二岸中間，獨這棧橋，祇一面連着岸。從前德國人僅建築了一部份，市府又花了六十多萬元，把它完成了。橋的兩旁，闌以鐵練，安着一字式的長椅，橋靠岸的一頭，有一小方沙地，擺着石凳石台，沙地旁邊又有一小方草地，栽植花卉，那都是供人游息的。橋石面一帶海堤，礁石嶙峋，海水撞在石上，飛起一丈多高的白沫；左面是一片平沙，海水舒卷不息，發出如同黄牛似的鼾聲。橋的盡頭處，築起一座宮殿式的樓閣，雕梁畫棟，金碧輝煌，上面懸着沈鴻烈市長書的迴瀾閣三字一方横匾。在橋上佇立閒眺，但見綠水長天，横空一碧。在此酷日施威之下，一班青島中産階級以下的居民，便以此爲消暑納凉的所在。一到日落崦嵫的時候，就有不少男男女女，成羣結隊的向橋上走來，着實有些熱閙景象。最引人注目的，是一班赤脚露腿的摩登小姐，還有木屐兒和西方人，在人叢中熙來攘往，還有停泊在海上的外國兵艦，水兵們坐着他們自備的汽艇，風馳電掣般往來疾駛，他們都在此登岸，當然個個高視闊步，擺出十足洋大人的架子，聽説他們每月六十金元的收入，統統花費在醇酒婦人身上，不肯剩下分文的。青島論地理應派是我們北方很重要的軍港，現在却變成了一個風景區，我對於這大好河山，眞覺得感喟無窮！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>論殺風景</h3>
<p>— 王哲</p>
<p>無論誰，每碰到殺風景的人，聽到殺風景的話，看到殺風景的行爲，總是不勝憤慨而怏怏不快的。的確，殺風景在一般人的心目中，至少不是一個好名詞；你想要是動聽的好名詞，難道會遭人一致的憎惡麽？</p>
<p>殺風景的本身所予人的不良印象，就是掃人興緻，譬如一個人，正當賓朋滿座，高談闊論，快樂得忘形的時候，突然告訴他説；他的家裏死了一個人，這便是大殺風景。又如一對戀姦情熱的野鴛鴦，有一天方借旅館大圓其好夢之際，驀地闖進幾個人來作奸，這亦是大殺風景。還有，如東西兩家村婦，駡街終日，豪興彌酣，忽有自稱魯仲連者出而調解，這又是大殺風景。諸如此類的殺風景的勾當，其敗人雅興，猶似一盆冷水夾頭夾腦的澆得人啼笑皆非，這樣而欲不惹起人的惡感，烏乎可？</p>
<p>殺風景的勾當，旣是以掃人興緻稱於世，則幹殺風景的勾當者，多少總不免得罪於人，這是不容諱言的。不過，有人以爲幹殺風景的勾當的人，初必存惡意中傷的觀念，因而構成其得罪的行爲，這個問題却值得加以討論了。實際地説，殺風景行爲之得罪於人，須視其事態以爲决定，固不必心存惡意中傷而始演出也。例如昔年劉紀文任南京市長時，馬二先生竟在其所住的美奐洋樓近傍搭蓋一草廬屈身自居，這當然是惡意中傷大殺風景！又如最近某跳舞塲有某姓舞客携青白小蛇，放生於舞廳内作崇，這種殺風景，也是具有惡意中傷的罪狀。然若從前劉復博士禁止人用（密絲）作爲未嫁女子的稱呼，而以（姑娘）代之，這種殺風景行爲，雖不具惡意中傷之性質，然其得罪於人，則是事實：又如近日來一般好古者鑒於文風式徽，而提倡文言文，以後事復興，這也是存好意的殺風景勾當，而卒得罪於人。由此可知殺風景的事情，存惡意固不免得罪於人，而存好心亦足以得罪於人也。</p>
<p>雖然，無論是存惡意中傷或存好心，其幹此殺風景的勾當者，都是吃飽了飯嘸啥事體做，這是毫無疑義的，惟其飽食終日，無所用心，於是不得不干涉是非，動輒以不入耳之言相餉，藉此解頤，而天下殺風影之事，遂多如牛毛矣。因此一般人咒詛那幹殺風景的人，常忿然的説：（那些好事之徒，什麽事都可作爲消遣，奈何計不出此，而獨愛幹殺風景的勾當，直是忘八羔子！）其實，他們未曾仔細想想，假令世界上鎭日價無殺風景的事態出現，那人生不知要多少乏味，這纔眞是大殺風景了！</p>
<p>要而言之，殺風景固屬可惡，而無風景可殺亦實可憐，吾於此，寗教天下之好事者，冒大不韙，大殺天下之風景可也。</p>
<h3>護鳥運動</h3>
<p>— ＯＨ</p>
<p>（護鳥），這名詞確是中聽，而且早有人説，人的天性本來是善的，那末，對於（護鳥），鳥亦係生物之一，我們秉人的天性的眼光來看，對於殺害生物，當然要起立反對了！</p>
<p>這不過是一方面的言詞，如果站在反面來看，這根據就要推翻了，生物學中有一種呌生存的競爭，人是最善於（競爭）的動物，而且這（競爭）是必要的，如果人類不去殺害鳥，鳥就得一天一天的多起來，如果到了一個時期，這世界不是變成了一個鳥的世界麽？</p>
<p>這是兩個相反的理由，也各有其主張的擁護者，後者固然不能説有充分的理由，但前者也非明正大道，如果我們把眼光稍爲放大些一看，這世界是一個什麽世界，如果我們再老實的説，那末，簡直可以説這是併吞的世界了，不竟是人和獸之間永遠的互相衝突着，競爭着，卽人與人之間亦永遠水火不容的併吞着。</p>
<p>本來，這世界就有些古怪得可以，有些事簡直使人無從捉摸起，（殺人）爲人類所不喜的，然而，一面却製造出各種的大批殺人機器，一若人多了是與他有妨害似的，非得殺掉些不可，因此，殺人魔王（各種殺人機器製者）一批一批的起來，各國政府非但不去禁止他，却極力的提倡着，目的無非是能多殺幾個人而已！</p>
<p>進一步説，（護鳥）旣有人倡議，而且有人附議，却不見有人起來提議（禁止殺人），這是什麽理由呢？上海人所謂戳穿鏡子説，（玩玩白相）而已！本來，誰能否認人類是戴着（假面具一的，一回兒鐵硬的心腸施展着、一回兒却又變成了慈悲人了！正所謂，（做好事者，末必都是善人）！安知他做好事的錢財是從那一條黑暗的路裏滾來的！但人類總是聰敏的，如果不懂些（做人的藝術），也白做了（人）了！因此，骨子和肚裏係一問題，面子上的金非裝得好看不可，而杜會上在目前也只有這般畸形（非外表畸形）人物可以存在，因此，到處就很容易的遇到這種人物了！</p>
<p>更進一步説，因爲鳥有生命，是有生命的生物，所以有人去保護牠，但别的生物何嘗没有生命，我們又何忍去殘殺牠們呢，但這就可管不了許多了，因爲人類只是有着一種特異心（我也没有適當的名詞來形容牠）的，反正當（護鳥運動）只是一種好玩的動作罷了！如果當眞呌他們説出（只護鳥不護别）的理由，他自己也莫明其所以然了，如果再追問他，何以不去護人，他只有瞠目而答：（人是我願護的嗎？他本身不會護嗎？我爲什麽要去護他）？</p>
<p>有何理由好説，説説只當牠風刮過罷了，如果眞要一本正經講的道理，那末，（哼！這世界就不是講道理的世界）？</p>
<h3>病邊漫筆之二</h3>
<p>— 紅茶</p>
<p>一切病，都是醜惡的，只有肺病他是美麗的病。我且不要説許多青年們，爲了戀愛而吐血等艷事，肺病本身，就是很美麗的。</p>
<p>第一：肺病能够使人消瘦，而又不像其它急病那樣使人一瘦就瘦得不成樣。天下最難看的就是胖人了，胖人給人的感覺是油膩，討厭，而患肺病的人是决不會胖的，自然體育家肌肉壯健美少年骨肉調匀是比蒼白的肺病人更美，但是不生肺病安知自己不會發胖，現已因爲生肺病而必然的免於發胖是可以感謝的。</p>
<p>第二：肺病是有潮熱的，潮熱來時，兩面頰就因爲發燒而紅。這樣不但完全掩蓋了蒼白，并且更顯得十分春意，這紅較之黄胭脂爲嬌；較之紅胭脂爲雅，無怪肺病中一種名呌美人癆。當然這紅是不久長的，但是從來就是不久長的東西，纔呌人想念。斜陽裏一抹晚霞，暮春時一樹殘花，不也是不久長的嗎？</p>
<p>第三：肺病和吐血大槪相連的，而吐血又只有肺病吐的最美麗！血絲像女兒們劈好的紅綫，血點像春天原野裏的野花。假使滿口血，那又像古美人嚙爛的紅茸。</p>
<p>第四：患肺病的人，一定會失眠，而失眠，又是非常美麗的。晚上比白天美麗是誰都承認的，那時有無數窈窕星星閃着媚眼。假使是初三初四，那一灣新月使你想起那一個（好朋友）的眉兒，更深夜靜，你因爲失眠就細細凝觀，這時卽使你并没有愛人也覺得在天一方有一個美人存在。我素不歡喜定庵詩，但是他的（起看歷歷樓台外，窈窕春星或是君，）却能够使我點頭微笑。這一切又豈時不患失眠的人所能亨受？王仲則爲了女人偶然失眠，尚且做出（如此星辰非昨夜，爲誰風露立中宵，）那樣好詩，患肺病而失眠的人，雖則不一定會做詩，但是他們詩中的境界總是親身體騐的。</p>
<p>第五：患肺病的人，又有時候會想到死，因爲想到死，就會連帶把人生想想，這樣久而久之，會使自己不淺薄，世界上儘有完全不能道人生的意義。而且是胡亂生活着活動着的人。這種人，有一句最好的形容辭！（行尸走肉），忙亂了一生到底没有知道爲什麽；所謂（醉生夢死）者是也。古人以爲（與草木同腐）（没世而名不稱）爲最可哀，但是我以到底没有忙亂了了一生連自己也不知爲什麽那種人可哀，而患肺病却能够免了這一點的。免了這一點，雖死何恨，何况未必死耶？</p>
<p>總之，肺病是美麗的病，不但是美麗，并且是文學和哲學的病，自然這是一人之私言也。</p>
<h3>上海怎值得留戀？</h3>
<p>— 建</p>
<p>上海是個够吸引人的地方，大凡没有來過上海的人，無論他身在天津或廣州等閙市也正混得頗爲不差，但也總在渴切的盼望來上海。至於那些生息在城市甚至鄉間的人們，不消説，那渴慕的熱忱，更要加勝一等。自然，我就是這麽一個來身：不知怎樣，很小的時候，我便夢想來上海，其時正有一個族的本家在上海辦一所學校，父親與他有一面之識，我曾幾次哀求父親寫信給他帶我來上海唸書，父親總説我的年紀過小，長大些再説。等到長大了，父親不但不准我來上海，而且要我輟學了。這時我可不遵命了，冐着天大的險，在一個冰雪交加的隆冬的清晨，離别了暖和的家庭，一程又一程的逃來了上海。</p>
<p>上海，我到達了！上海，果然像我夢想般的美滿！直到我在上海混了整五年的時候，我還是這麽熱戀着。</p>
<p>然而近三年來，我覺得厭棄起了。</p>
<p>這裏有一種綫索可尋：先前我爲什麽那般熱戀着呢？現在又爲什麽起了厭棄？這，説來都有大道理，原來我先前之所以熱戀上海，是還没有眞正的到達上海，換句話説，我還不過像隔岸觀火，僅僅在上海的外殻上兜來兜去，一海的眞面目，我還不曾親到。也就是前五年我一逕關在與社會隔絶着的學校裏的原哉。現在是看透了，上海原來是這麽一種形態。</p>
<p>假使我是千金之子，那麽，上海倒也不會怎樣和我交不來。就是退一步，假使我生成是一幅長袖善舞的胚子，雖是兩手空空，别無長物，也儘好帷幄運籌，招財進寳，自己造就一個局面，也一樣的能在上海長威風，就是單憑運氣，中得到一次航空頭奬，也是辦法。上海就是這麽一個上海，單是富人的消金窩，窮人是絶不能安身的。我，自嗟命薄，生來很窮；而又於發財，中奬種種補救辦法，一樣毫無緣分。這天然只有滾開去，上海根本不是我的安身之所。</p>
<p>其次呀，假使我能寡廉鮮恥，無所不爲，那也還有辦法。上海就多着這一類的人，他們都是兩肩挾着一張嘴，很便當的每日吃飯拉屎，有時一陣風來，</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>他們乃更飛黄騰達，氣槪横天。生活於他們是毫無問題的。這種人，舉起實例來，就是流氓癟三。但我又是這麽少緣分；而且生性就厭惡這種人。當然，此路也是不通。</p>
<p>上海是這樣一個上海，我又是這樣一個我，天然只有離去一個辦法。然而，不知怎的，實行起來却是戞戞乎其難也。説起來，過去有過好幾會，朋友招我向外埠去，我總是設法的辭謝了。自然，那時是還有三分眷念上海的心情，雖説那時的尶𡯓，較現在爲尤甚。</p>
<p>現在呢，上海在我的眼底，已只有厭棄的地方，没有眷戀歌頌的處所了。却又苦着没有急急離去的機會。但我想總在不久的將來，可以離去啊。</p>
<h3>讀社會月報第三期</h3>
<p>— 清</p>
<p>這年頭，人家都説是雜誌年，如若把出版市塲上在這一年之間所絡續發刊的各樣各式的文藝性質的，非文藝性質的刊物加以一個統計，其數量眞個是洋洋乎大觀，説是雜誌年似乎並不見得是誇大的。</p>
<p>但一般地看，許多雜誌的出現，在編制上，内容上，往往患着一種共同的通病。不是過於徧重某一方面而形出異樣的單調；就是太於專門化。這在辦雜誌者自然有其固定的主張，不過倘爲廣大的讀者會的心理趣味着想。則未得見是適合要求。我以爲一個雜誌的能的别樹一幟，别開生面，頂要緊還是在於盡可能的範圍内盡量地將内容的疇範擴大一點，但不是散漫，而應系統的地，條理的地把雜誌造成一種多面性的姿態。</p>
<p>最近出版過二期的社會月報，在目下多到無以後加的刊物當中，從編制上看，從内容的包括上看，實在配説上是個别具風態的産生，適可地達到一個新型雜誌所應有的條件。以一種最新的姿勢呈獻到讀者的眼前，這現象是可喜的</p>
<p>第三期今天又出版了。並附了一個大衆語問題特輯，其他創作也較前充實些，活潑得多了。</p>
<p>尚有一向話，得再説，就是這雜誌的特色。不大登長文，所有的全是短小的而又不是低級趣味的精悍的短文。</p>
<p>然而缺點是太多，陣綫有點散漫，能整齊更好。全至如封面揷畫都太俗，總是，這都是容易改進的希望該編者拿出勁兒來，力求精進，替雜誌年打出一個新境地。</p>

<h3>五家鎭上一件大事</h3>
<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>富公公家裏今天像他大兒子娶親時一般熱閙起來。烏黑的大牆門敞開着，下人們忙着砌茶，開發轎錢，每一個來的親戚都是那樣衣冠楚楚，彷彿赴宴會似的。一切的一切，和富公公大兒子娶親的時候一般模樣。但是那些鄰居們却探頭探腦地張望着什麽，在富公公家辦喜事時，他們同是氣壯理直的穿上他們終年難得上身的高貴的衣服來道一聲恭喜吃一杯喜酒的。從這一點上可以知道富公公家今天的排塲，並不是什麽喜慶之類的大事，因爲只要他家裏舉行婚喪喜慶，他總歡迎這鎭上的任何一個人來參加，他是愛排塲的；而且團團數十里之内，誰都知道他是一個好好先生，所以無論同他僅僅會過一面的同鎭人，要是他家裏有事的話，定抛開了正事來參加的。</p>
<p>計算起來，是他兒子結婚後的第三個月。天氣已是漸漸地熱了，遠處隠隠有蟬聲送來。那些轎夫們都揮着箬帽在大樹下坐地，對於富公公家今天的集會也同樣覺得新奇而竊竊地私議着。最後族長伍老太爺坐轎子來了，他是五家鎭上最忙的人物，有着一個小縣官的權力，農民關於田地上的爭執，誰覇佔了鄰居的檐滴，甚至一個没有抵押品的借欵者，也可以憑伍老太爺的一句話而平安無事。</p>
<p>五家鎭雖不是個大鄉鎭，但團團方方數十里之内時常會尋不到伍老太爺的，原因實在是他太忙了。而且更是世代書香，五家鎭的定名也從這上來的，後來鄰鎭的以誤傳誤，認爲牠是七鎭之中地位最小的一個，大家呌起五家鎭來。</p>
<p>現在老熱天伍老太爺到富公公家來，那是一定有什麽稀有的事發生了。富公公大兒子富生討親的時候，他祇一坐就走了。所以當伍老太爺摇着鵝毛扇踏進烏黑的大牆門之後，許多人都圍上他的轎夫詢問今天的事。轎夫們摇摇頭代替了回答。揮着凉帽坐到樹蔭底下去。</p>
<p>這許多好探聽閑事的鄰居旣不得要領，回轉身來再想探望時，那兩扇烏黑大門又像平時一樣地緊閉了。這秘密終於在他們張大了的瞳孔中盤旋着。</p>

<h3>美國來年新片陣容</h3>
<p>— 塵雄</p>
<p>全國出品總在四百部以上　　歌舞影片達三十四部之多</p>
<p>每年秋凉時節，美國電影攝製者卽從事籌備來年出品，而名之曰某年度影片，而全年計劃，卽按照秋季所宣佈的製片方針着着進行。六七月間美國規模較大的影片公司如米高梅，派拉蒙，華納，福斯等，各選擇一個適中區域，爲招集全公司製片及發行人員，會聚一起商議來年出品的事情。現在各影片公司的一提一度的大會議已經絡續完竣，來年出品的名目也大都决定了。</p>
<p>一九三四至三五年度的全美出品，比去年至今年春所出者要多三十部。其中出片增加最多的公司爲聨美，因爲裏面多了一個二十世紀公司的出品，由每年十二部增加到二十四部。并且聨美兼代發行英國倫敦影片公司（卽（英宮艷史）與（凱塞琳女皇）出生者）的出品。這是英國最偉大的影片公司，今委託聨美代爲發行，所以聨美出片勢力，就充實了許多了。出片家桑高温的來年出品計有三部，兩部歸蘇俄女星安娜史丹主演，一部歌舞片由愛第康泰主演，亦均由聨美發行的。</p>
<p>西部題材的影片，恐怕於本年美國出品中會絶跡的了。這是時代進展的趨勢使然。西部題材的影片，就是在美國境内，也缺少了大部分的觀衆，所以爲節省較少收入的出品起見，各公司抛棄了這種題材的片子了。但歷來以攝製西部影片爲主的環球與哥倫比亞兩公司，仍有繼續攝製幾部以應市面的計劃呢。</p>
<p>目前各影片公司都注重歌舞片子。統計來年美國新片數目總在四百部以上，各題材都有，尤以歌舞爲盛，共佔三十四部之多，其次爲歷史古裝片，滑稽片等，關於暗殺偵探，下流社會等描寫片子佔極少數。動作影片如賽馬，足球，競艇等題材也减少了；暴露社會各方面的片子，亦頗有可觀；偉大塲面的片子，仍是有增無减。</p>
<p>派拉蒙六十四部正片的數目，是各影片公司來年出品中之最多者。其中四十九部已定好了片名了。其次爲華納公司，共出六十部。已决定攝製者四十七部。福斯共出五十八部，現在已决定者，計有四十九部。米高格宣佈五十二部，但計劃尚在變更中，尚無正式佈告表示。雷電華五十部中三十三部已排定，環球計有四十二部。哥倫比亞四十八部，聨美二十四部。</p>
<p>因爲歌舞片的盛行，各公司劃出大部分時間在攝製這類片子。福斯計有歌舞片十一部，佔量多數；華納與雷電華各五部；派拉蒙與環球各四部；米高梅三部，聨美兩部，其中一部就是桑高温出片，由愛第康泰主演。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評（神醫）</h3>
<p>— 巽之</p>
<p>Ｔhe　Love　Captive－南京映</p>
<p>原作導演和製片者的企圖，無疑的都是在投合觀衆的獵奇趣味，可是當我們看完了這片子之後，覺得這種企圖明白地是没有成功的。原作和導演，是不很熟悉的Marcin我們可以不必苛責，而製片者加爾，拉梅萊（Carl　Laemme）却使我們懷疑到他的見識和（生意眼）了。</p>
<p>故事的離奇荒誕，不近情理，與唆示着（妨害良風美俗）之點，我想這片子的故事和表演，假使是中國影片公司攝製了的時候，禁映大槪是不成問題的了，（幸而）這是美國公司的出品。</p>
<p>正像一切中外的神怪片一樣，嚴密地檢討他的意識和企圖，對於有常識的觀衆是不必要的。他祗是無現實要據地寫了一個以所謂催眠術爲骨幹的戀愛故事，對於厭倦了平凡的性生活的人們，唆示着除出他們所已經歷的一切之外，還有一種可以用魔術來左右的（愛的醫術），所以，在結末，這（神醫）雖則被他的情敵槍殺而宣告了這種（術）的失敗，但是，在内心，高貴而有閑的人們中大約有不少是勸待着這樣的（術數）的。這樣的故事，已經規定了它的一切，正像中國的舊神怪小説一樣，不需要有什麽嚴整的，論理的結構，反正，他已經預先布置好，（蓋此術極爲神妙，設非施術者死亡，他人决難破除之）的了。</p>
<p>導演祇平凡地説明的這樣一個故事，並不緊張，和没有高潮的。當然，對於作爲中心骨幹的催眠術的神秘性和獵奇味，也不能和他宣傳一樣地能够支配觀衆的情感，假使你要從這片子中去看（爲其獵艷求歡之用的）（神秘手術），一定是會使你感到失望的。</p>
<h3>大明星間的爭鬥</h3>
<p>— 贄</p>
<p>在好萊塢銀星的舞臺上，熌爍着無數的銀星兒。在許多昨兒們傾軋之下，爭鬥是必然的事實。這種爭鬥，是異乎尋常的。因爲女星是處在絶對的主動地位，局外人也决没有參與的權利。這裏有性與肉的對抗，個性與藝術的爭鬥。一切都是不平凡的，大明星都是這裏的中堅份子。</p>
<p>嘉寳和瑪琳黛德麗兩人間的爭鬥，已無形消滅，她倆的作風，各有所長，所佔的地盤也各異，在藝術方面，根本無從比較，勝負也無從判斷。爭鬥的結果，把兩人的身價都提高了，聲譽也廣播開去。總之這是一回虚僞的爭鬥。</p>
<p>繼起者有兩個三角對抗的局面。就是嘉寳，凱絲琳赫和康斯登絲裴納三人。這是一個精神和藝術競爭的團體。嘉寳以個性來保持她的皇后寳座，赫本以藝術來維持她的聲望。裴納則居於次重要的地位。</p>
<p>另一個三角競爭的團體是梅蕙絲瑪琳黛德麗和安娜史妲三人。梅的曲綫美，瑪琳的鮮艷美麗·和安娜的口唇兒，都是被認爲美的中心點。安娜史妲是影界的新進明星，在藝術上的急進，實堪驚人。瑪琳和梅雖有妖艷動人的姿態，也决不能和安娜爭抗，以致梅和瑪琳的地位都發生了危險性。安娜具有一種同情力，超過了一切性的誘惑，細纖的肌膚，爲好萊塢任何女星所無的。除此以外，她的身體各部，也都合乎現代審美家心目中的綫條美。</p>
<p>至於三人的年齡，梅最大，瑪琳次之，安娜最小。三人的作風，梅善演風騷冶蕩，瑪琳和安娜善飾悲角。國籍是各異的，梅是美人，瑪琳是德人，安娜是俄人。在無形中這也可算是國際間的競爭，但是藝術是不分國境的，三人言語的音調，也有相似的地方，但她們各自的土音總脱不掉，她們都具有一種熱的魔力，使人顚倒。</p>
<p>明星間的競爭，終不能停止，將來的結果，也不能預測，在電影的立塲上説，藝術高於一切。其餘如性與肉的方面，祗能認爲時間性的競爭而已，將來終有没落的危險性，祇有藝術能維持永久。</p>
<h3>平克勞斯貝去矣</h3>
<p>— 叔文</p>
<p>平，在最近的數年中，很顯然的得到了極大的成功了。他的天賦的歌喉，活潑的動作，都與觀衆深刻的印象，誠然，像平那樣平地一聲雷的紅起來，我們却不能説他是僥倖得來的。但是驚人的消息傳來説是他就要離開好萊塢了，這對於觀衆是如何不幸的消息呀。本來像他這樣正在蒸蒸日上的時候，怎麽還會得厭棄銀幕生涯呢？那末我們且看他所得的理由：</p>
<p>（最多再拍一本戲），他説：（我是無論如何也要走了，我預備仍舊在加里福尼亞，過一個清閒的生活，我很足以自給。我並不是一個不知足的人，我願意很簡樸的住下去！）</p>
<p>（我生平以爲最愚蠢的莫過於鑽求人家的贊許，然而這却是好萊塢一般人所最要做的事情，我是無論如何不能的！）</p>
<p>（我和好萊塢並没有不合的地方，我也並非厭棄銀幕的生活，但是我不能欺騙我自己。人家説我是大明星，我不過會唱唱歌罷了，那末我又何必勉强繼續下去而增加我的痛苦呢。）</p>
<p>（我並不是一個畏難的人，我也不願以後我不再工作，不過我要以幸福爲前提。這樣我很想繼續我的無綫電歌唱職業，並不是因爲牠能增加我的金錢收入。委實是我和牠分離不開。假使我到了不能歌唱的時候，我也願在電臺裏工作，或者寫點關於無綫電歌唱的書。）</p>
<p>平是眞的决意離好萊塢了。這不是一朝一夕的起意，却是已有兩年多了，當然他爲的個人的前途幸福和快樂不得不如此，然而影界却又失了一位明星了</p>

<h3>爭愛得子（Doctor　Monica）（二）</h3>
<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>她們談話提到了曼麗頭眩的事情，這陡然使曼麗廻想到上次她在安娜家裏所遇到的一切情景。歷歷如繪的，她記得一種聲音，直刺進她的心中。一種老實不客氣的聲音，告訴她一種老實不客氣的事實……就是約翰要到歐洲去了，並且要去六個月之久。那不過一兩句話的聲音，但是在曼麗的四週，她那時正彈着鋼琴，好像天旋地轉似的一切都塌下來了。呼吸立時覺得困難了……眼前的一切都昏黑了……一切都不知覺了。曼麗竭力地想忘記那可怖的一幕，而回到現在。她勉强笑着，向她兩位朋友表示慚愧之意。蒙尼卡安慰着她道：（那你又何必記在心上呢？我不過替你怪担心的，所以問你一問，况且你後來又趕緊要去到一個約會，你又不肯立即回家去。）</p>
<p>其實呢，那個約會，就是她和約翰的約會……最後的一次。安娜又斜睨着曼麗逗她道：（現在你的大情人是誰？）曼麗停了一停，勉强説了一聲；（你不認識的。）安娜又問道：（他亦在船上嗎）？安娜向來是喜歡逗笑而毫無惡意的。她因爲曼麗一時回答不出來就向他臉上端詳了一下，然後喊道：（我知道了。他亦到歐洲去了。蒙尼卡，你看，她眼睛還哭得腫了呢。）蒙尼卡揑着曼麗的臂膀道：（怪可憐的孩子。就明白你心中的苦楚。但是你或者比我還好些，你的情人一定看見你在碼頭上，而向你招手的。）在這個時候，曼麗覺得要是這種刺人心肺的，想入非非的談話，再繼續下去的話，她要發神經病了。這種不可思議的連屬，將來怎樣的解决。她的情人……蒙尼卡的男人。兩個人都在碼頭送行。兩個人都各自含了（包眼涙，向肚子裏嚥下去。曼麗自己咬着自己的嘴唇。她一定自加振作，萬萬不可就此放手。這時候，蒙尼卡温存的語音，又灌進了她思慮沉沉之中。蒙尼卡説道：（在約翰不在家的時，我暫時住在安娜的家裏。寳貝，你也來，我們同病相憐，可以互相慰藉尉藉也是好的。候曼麗似乎有所畏懼的説道：（我看還是不要這樣的好。）安娜不等她决定，輕輕一推，就將她推進了一輛道旁等候着的汽車。她説：（走進去！不用倔强了！你和蒙尼卡所共同需要的，係一杯酒。）</p>
<p>曼麗一路上，心事重重，無言可説的走到安娜的家裏。等到到了那裏，她忽然又有説有笑起來。安娜在調着酒。曼麗接到手裏，很勇的一仰而盡，靜等着一種麻醉力的發作。安娜是一位很有些小名氣的建築家。她把二位朋友安排好了，就自己忙於工作。蒙尼卡獨自一個人在烘着火，在那融融烈熖之中。好像看見了她男人影子似的。曼麗身子有些發抖，她思慮萬千的在腦筋裏盤旋着，而她手中那盞酒杯亦不斷地在她手中盤旋着。她想的不是别人，亦是約翰。她想着這種奇怪的事，他應當編成一本小説。這却是小説裏的事，尋常所不經見的。尤其是像蒙尼卡，約翰和她自己，所夢想不到的。但是，事實上這種事却是發生了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Military Exercises of the Japanese Army Completed</h3>
<p>Last night, they boarded trains and returned to Tianjin and Beijing. Japanese warships successively concentrated in Dagu to await exercises. (Tianjin) On the 20th, at 7 AM, the Japanese troops in Qinhuangdao started from street fighting exercises to attacking and seizing Nada Temple. The sound of artillery was heard far and wide. All troops participated. The Japanese troops in Shanhaiguan also conducted seizure exercises at the Jiukou and Jiaoshan Temple. This was the last of the final exercises, ending at 2 PM. Troops successively returned to the Yuqin railway station to board trains, waiting to return to their original defenses on the morning of the 21st. When the Japanese troops were exercising at Shihe’an and Nada Temple, they dug trenches. The Japanese troops did not allow us to fill them even after withdrawing, saying they would be kept for the next exercise. (20th Special Dispatch) (Tianjin) The main force of the Japanese army exercising in Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao was scheduled to dismantle their campsites on the night of the 20th and return to their accommodation on the train. On the morning of the 21st, they took two special trains to return to their original defenses in Tianjin and Beijing. This time, the Japanese army exercised eight times at Nada Temple in Qinhuangdao, six times at Yuguan, and once at Shihe. Because the troops of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France maintained calm, no unexpected misfortune occurred. The Japanese side believed that the exercise ended as expected, so they returned to Tianjin and Beijing and did not stay there any longer. (20th Special Dispatch) (Tianjin) The warships of the Japanese Third Fleet have sailed from the ports of Dalian and Lushun to participate in the naval exercises outside Dagukou and are heading to their destination. The four ships of the 26th Destroyer Squadron, Kaki, Yu, Kuri, and Muro, and the three ships of the 27th Destroyer Squadron, To, Ryo, and I, set sail from Yingkou on the 20th and are expected to arrive at Dagukou on the 21st. The Tianjin Customs has specially notified ships coming to and from Tianjin Port regarding the Japanese navy's exercises outside Dagukou starting on the 26th, advising them to use other routes to enter the port during the exercise period to avoid misunderstandings. (20th Special Dispatch) (Tianjin) Chief of Staff Sakai Takashi of the Japanese Garrison Command has taken office. On the 20th, he visited various Japanese agencies in Tianjin. The Japanese army in Tianjin will conduct street fighting exercises at 2 PM on the 24th, which will be commanded by Sakai. (20th Special Dispatch) (Tianjin) Kikuchi Sada, Chief of Staff of the Japanese North China Garrison, will return to Japan on the 24th via the Changping 9. The newly appointed Chief of Staff Sakai arrived in Tianjin on the evening of the 19th. (20th Special Dispatch) Malanyu</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Exercises as a Show of Force</h3>
<p>Bombers Test Drop Heavy Weights (Tianjin) At 10 AM on the 18th, a Japanese plane flew from Rehe to Malanyu, circling in the sky for a long time. Afterwards, it practiced tactics on the Great Wall line and dropped several heavy-weight bombs. It flew away at 11 AM. (20th Special Dispatch) (Beiping) According to reports from Malanyu, after the fall of Xinglong County, a puppet organization set up an office to govern it, forcing farmers to plant opium poppies, collecting a special tax of five yuan per mu, plus a service fee of four jiao as a surveying and registration fee, totaling more than sixty items. After the opium seedlings were harvested, they had to be purchased by experts from the puppet government's Daman Company, and private trading was prohibited. Recently, the Daman Company was suddenly sealed off by Wang Boheng, the head of the puppet office. According to the opium planters, due to heavy rain during the harvest season this year, each mu only yielded thirty to forty taels, and the farmers were all complaining endlessly. (20th Special Dispatch) (Beiping) Last August 14th was the first day for the Xinglong County government office to be established in Malanyu. On the 14th of this month, County Chief Li Ying convened a memorial meeting of various agencies to report on the political and diplomatic situation of the past year. On the evening of the 16th, a detachment of the security team was sent from Tongxian, with Su Xue as the team leader, to the Malanyu office to guard the area. The puppet army withdrew the 6th company of Song Dingming's troops stationed at the Western Empress Dowager's Mausoleum to Kuancheng on the morning of the 17th. In the afternoon, a platoon from the 5th company was also withdrawn. Because the security team arrived, the Japanese army conducted live-fire demonstrations on the morning of the 17th. Immediately afterwards, a bomber came and circled in the air for more than ten minutes. In the afternoon, the Japanese army exercised again at the foot of Yu Mountain. (20th Special Dispatch) (Tianjin) At 9 AM on the 17th, Lin Tian, ​​the Japanese councillor of the Puppet Rehe Provincial Government, took a plane to Malanyu Eastern Mausoleum to inspect and met with Yin Tixin, the director of the Jiji District stationed in Malanyu, to discuss the Malanyu custody incident. On the 18th, he returned to Chengde on the original plane. (20th Special Dispatch) (Beiping) The issue of receiving the Eastern Mausoleum of Malanyu has been repeatedly delayed due to the obstruction of Pingdong transportation. After the heavy rain last night, several sections of the Pingji Avenue were washed away, and cars could not pass. According to Yin Rugeng, there is no confirmed news about the receipt. The Eastern Mausoleum Custody Committee is still awaiting the nomination of representatives from the Qing Dynasty descendants, so the formal organization is still pending. (20th Special Dispatch) Japanese Trafficking of Opium</p>
<h3>Arrested in Jixian Territory</h3>
<p>Yin Rugeng Orders Immediate Transfer to Beiping for Transfer to the Japanese Police Station for Interrogation (Beiping) Xin Zupei, the director of the Huangyaguan Pass Public Security Bureau Branch Office in Jixian County, saw two Japanese and Chinese people entering the port on the 18th, whose behavior was suspicious. After inspection, more than 500 taels of opium were found in their luggage. According to the Japanese, his name was Tsukamoto Tsukiichiro, and the Chinese name was Zhang Shuoqing. The witnesses were taken to the Public Security Bureau of the Jixian County Government. After interrogation by Liu Jiaxun, the director of the bureau, Okamoto confessed that he ran a pawnshop in the city of Zunhua County and that he colluded with Zhang Shuoqing this time to traffic opium. After the interrogation, County Chief Wu Minghao telegraphed Beiping to report to Yin Rugeng and asked for instructions. Yin went to the Japanese Embassy yesterday to negotiate and decided to hand over the Japanese Okamoto, who was trafficking drugs, to the Japanese police station for strict handling. Yin telegraphed Jixian today to immediately transfer Okamoto to Beiping and hand him over to the Japanese police station. His accomplice, the Chinese Zhang Shuoqing, will be dealt with by the county according to law. The Jiji District Office is quite suspicious of Okamoto's claim that he runs a pawnshop in Zunhua and has telegraphed Zunhua County to conduct a detailed inspection and report.

<h3>Song Zheyuan Returns to Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegram, Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, Wang Xi, Zhang Yunrong, Xuan Jiexie, etc., left Jiabusi on the morning of the 19th, arrived in Zhangbei at noon, and arrived in the province at 4 PM. Qin Dechun said that Regiment Commander Yang, accompanied by Zhang Yunrong and Xu Jifu, went to Jiabusi on the 15th to see Song. On the 16th, the battalion commanders of Yang's unit also went to Jiabusi to see Song. The original number of Yang's regiment was more than 2,000 people, and it was decided to reduce it to more than 1,500 people. He himself represented Song on the 18th to go to Sifangtai Fangzi to take roll call and give instructions. Yang's unit all expressed their obedience. Xiao Zhenying said that he went to De Wang's place on the 16th and intended to go to Bailing Temple to meet De Wang. De Wang heard the news and rushed back from the temple. The meeting was very pleasant. The rumors outside are all false. Although there are many Japanese from the Japanese Post-War Cooperation Agency coming and going, they do not go there often. It has now been agreed with De Wang that all Hui people entering the country must have a passport from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Pingzheng Rehabilitation Military Branch, or the Provincial Government before they can pass, otherwise they will be refused. The Provincial Government has also selected liaison officers to be stationed at De Wang's Mansion and clerks to be stationed at Pangjiang to handle all matters to avoid misunderstandings outside. De Wang also hopes that He will take office as soon as possible. He returned to Jiabusi on the 18th and will return to the province with Song and will return to Beiping to see He. (20th) (Beiping) Men Zhizhong, a member of the Military Branch, will go to Zhangjiakou today to contact Song Zheyuan for official business and will return to Beiping within a few days.

<h3>PingSui Transportation Restored</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Due to the heavy rain the day before yesterday between Qixia Ying and San Dao Ying on the PingSui Railway, more than a thousand feet of the roadbed was washed away. After being repaired by workers, it has been restored, and full-line transportation has been restored this morning. (20th Special Dispatch) (Beiping) The Road Bureau has instructed each section to plan, list charts, compile, and submit for review the post-war measures for the damaged sections of the PingSui Railway. (20th Special Dispatch) Yiyuan and other four ports</p>
<h3>Preparing to Establish Branch Posts</h3>
<p>Gao Yuanji departs with four officers (Beiping) Gao Yuanji led the directors of the four branch posts of Yiyuan, Xifeng, Lengkou, and Jieling this morning from Beiping to Tangshan, preparing to go to various places to prepare for the establishment of branch posts.

The Tianjin Customs has telegraphed Jing to report twelve tax collection measures, which have also been approved, and the Customs has been ordered to follow them. It is said that the other four posts will be established on the 1st of next month. (20th Special Dispatch) (Tianjin) The Tianjin Customs has completed the recruitment of staff for the Great Wall posts and has sent a letter to Zhang Yongnian to be dispatched by the Ministry. In addition to the Gubeikou post, which can be established on the 22nd, the four posts of Xifeng Yiyuan Lengkou Jieling are in the process of preparation. The Ministry of Finance will set up eleven more branch posts to prevent counterfeit goods from being smuggled in through other routes, with one director appointed for each post. The candidates and locations have all been internally determined, and work can begin as soon as there are no diplomatic issues. The eleven posts are: Xiang Zhenan, director of Yukou Town, Sanhe County; Wang Chongren, director of Jiangjunguan, Pinggu County; Liang Shaozhuang, director of Huangyaguan; the directors of Taoyuan Town and Shisili Dam in Zunhua County have not yet been determined; Xu Zihai, director of Shimen Town, Jixian County; Jiang Jianren, director of Nantianmen, Miyun County; Pan Weijie, Qiangzilukou, Zhou Haitao, director of Dashuilukou; Lin Zhongda, director of Baimaguan; Xu Gezhou, director of Caojialu.

<h3>Will Establish Beiping Shenyang Branch</h3>
<p>Zhang Shuiqi Arrives in Beiping (Beiping) Zhang Shuiqi, the manager of the Oriental Travel Agency, went to Moganshan to pay respects at the invitation of Huang Fu and reported on the progress of the Beiping-Shenyang through train. Afterwards, he left Hangzhou with Huang and went to Gu. Zhang arrived in Beiping from Hankou last night, and his whereabouts were secretive. It is heard that Zhang is planning to set up branch offices in Beiping and Shenyang to facilitate contact. Zhang is scheduled to take the Beiping-Shenyang through train back to Yu on the morning of the 22nd. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hebei Agricultural Water Conservancy Association</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Agricultural Water Conservancy Association held its second general meeting at the Provincial Government at 10 AM today, deciding on (1) digging wells in the plains, (2) digging springs along the mountains, and (3) opening canals along the rivers.

<h3>Lurking in the Mountains of Xingtai</h3>
<p>Scattered by County Government Police Teams (Tianjin) Liu Guitang bandits were found to be lurking in the mountains of Shahe Town, Xingtai County, Jinnan, planting opium. After being discovered by the County Government, police teams were sent to scatter the bandits and destroy the opium seedlings. The director of the Public Security Bureau who knew the situation but did not report it was arrested and detained. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Bandits Abound in Eastern Tianjin</h3>
<p>Tao Shangming Agrees with Chai Shan to Transport Heavy Machine Guns to Suppress Them (Tianjin) Bandits abound in the three counties of Ludong, Lulong, Leting, and Funing in Eastern Tianjin. A certain troop stationed in Funing was formerly part of Li Jichun's old troops. They are difficult to tame. After the night is quiet every night, they change into civilian clothes and plunder in all directions. The local police are powerless to intervene. No one dares to travel alone in the daytime four or five miles outside the city. (20th Special Dispatch) (Tianjin) Zhao Xun, director of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, came to Tianjin this morning and paid a visit to Yu Xuezhong at noon, seeking instructions on how to suppress bandits in and out of Tangshan City. Bandits are rampant in various places in Luandong. The security teams have always lacked heavy firearms to pursue them. Tao Shangming has recently negotiated with Chai Shan in Beiping and obtained the consent of the Japanese side to allow the transport of heavy machine guns. Tao is scheduled to come to Tianjin on the 22nd to report to Ji Yu. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jiao Yitang Arrives in Beiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>Inspects the National Medical Branch Will Return to Nanjing in Three to Five Days (Beiping) Jiao Yitang arrived in Beiping on the morning of the 20th. According to him, he came to inspect the Central National Medical Branch and visit relatives and friends, with no other mission. He will stay for three to five days and then return to Nanjing. President Sun has left Honolulu and returned to China and is expected to arrive in Shanghai via Hong Kong at the end of the month. Sun's trip is purely a summer vacation trip. His meeting with the US President was a private social event with no contact whatsoever. The draft amendment to the Constitution has been announced and has adopted opinions from all parties as much as possible. Whether the election of the President will be elected by the National Assembly or by the people has not yet been decided. It may be officially announced next spring. As for the organizational law of counties and cities, because it was previously too idealistic, it was revised by the Legislative Yuan's Legislative Affairs Committee and changed to the Implementation Law of County and City Autonomy to promote the spirit of democracy. The draft has also been announced, and it is hoped that the people will contribute their opinions and send them to the Legislative Yuan before the end of September to gather wisdom and conduct in-depth research. In addition, it is reported that a large amount of silver has recently been exported from Shanghai, which may be because the United States adopted a silver standard to buy silver. This is evidenced by the fact that the United Kingdom also has a large amount of silver exports, which can be seen from a glimpse. However, our country uses silver and should pay special attention. (20th Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<h3>Tan Zhen Telegraphs Arrival in Belgium</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Tan Zhen telegraphed Jing saying that he had arrived in Belgium from England and would go to Berlin, then return to London to send Song Zhenlu, the son of the martyr Song Yufu, to school, and then return to China via the United States, arriving in Shanghai around early November. (20th Special Dispatch) The Chinese Embassy in Brussels issued a statement saying that Tan Zhen, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan of China, is currently in Europe, examining the judicial organizations of various countries. He arrived here from London on Thursday evening. On Friday, he visited the directors of various departments of the Ministry of Justice.

<h3>Memorial Meeting for the Martyrdom of Liao Zhongkai</h3>
<p>Ye Chucang Reports at the Central Memorial Meeting (Nanjing) The Central Party Headquarters held the 144th weekly memorial service and the memorial meeting for the 9th anniversary of the martyrdom of Martyr Liao on the morning of the 20th. Members of the Central Committee, Ye Chucang, Dai Chuanxian, Shi Qingyang, Zhu Jiahua, Chu Minyi, Fu Rulin, Zeng Zhongming, Zhou Qigang, Xiao Zhongzhen, Wang Qi, He Yaozu, and representatives of various agencies and all staff members of the departments, about 800 people. Chairman Ye Chucang led the ceremony to pay tribute to the Prime Minister and Martyr Liao and made a report, roughly saying that today is the 9th anniversary of the martyrdom of Martyr Liao. At the same time, it is the first weekly memorial service after the announcement of the Central convocation of the Fifth National Congress. We review the past and recall the merits of Martyr Liao, and we have a consistent understanding, which is enough to inspire the future. Martyr Liao's revolutionary determination came from a high level of academic foundation, so he was able to persevere. His revolutionary strategy also came from scientific knowledge research, so he was able to be correct and reasonable. In addition, his great personality enabled him to build great achievements, all of which are sufficient to be a model for us. Especially in the most difficult environment at that time, he held many important positions, such as finance, agriculture, industry, and sports, and was finally able to use his determination and strategy to solve them one by one, so that the foundation of the revolution could be consolidated. When the party was reorganized, Mr. Liao prepared for the First National Congress, and we only saw him working hard all day long, and he finally succeeded. Today, we are preparing for the Fifth National Congress, which is appropriate at a time when the world is in trouble. Recalling Martyr Liao's spirit of struggle, we have felt that our hearts are more than enough but our strength is insufficient in the past three years. The reason for the insufficiency may be that we have not followed Mr. Liao's example of using knowledge as the basis for determination and science as the root of strategy, so our ability is far inferior to Mr. Liao's greatness. My feelings are that I recognize this point and contribute it to all comrades. After the speech, the ceremony was completed and adjourned at 9 AM.

<h3>Situation of the Breach in Changyuan</h3>
<p>(Kaifeng) Engineer Cai of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission returned to Bian after surveying the breach in Changyuan. According to reports, there were originally nine breaches at that place, and five of them were properly blocked at the time. The two breaches of Menggangdong Liaobiang were blocked with willow dams. Because there is no way to get soil, it is still inevitable that they will collapse in the event of a major flood. Thousands of workers on the embankments of Huaxian and Kao'an are returning to their hometowns in the water because their family properties have been exhausted. Moreover, there is water inside and outside the embankment, so there is no way to get soil. If there is no heavy rain, the water will not rise, and construction can begin in three weeks. (20th Special Dispatch) (Tianjin) Representatives of the people of Changyuan in Tianjin telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance and Industry on the 20th, urging them to quickly raise funds to deal with the Changyuan flood disaster.

After receiving the telegram, the Executive Yuan immediately telegraphed Li, ordering him to earnestly urge the river workers to carefully protect the embankment and not to be negligent in the slightest.

<h3>Paper Currency Circulation Overview</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance completes the investigation (Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance, considering the large number and variety of domestic banknotes issued, sent personnel to investigate the circulation situation in various ways. Now that the task has been completed and returned to Beijing, it is reported that among the banknotes circulating nationwide, the Central Bank has the largest amount, followed by the China and Communications Banks. The circulation of the China Bank is about 190,000,000 yuan, and the circulation of the Communications Bank is about 60,000,000 yuan. The circulation of other banks is very small. As for foreign banks in China, such as HSBC, Citibank, Mercantile Bank, Banque Sino-Belge, and Yokohama Specie Bank, they are all established in concessions without special permission from our country, so their circulation is limited to the concessions. In addition, the banknotes issued by the Japanese Bank of Korea and the Yokohama Specie Bank mostly circulate in Southern Manchuria. In provinces such as Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, and Hunan, in addition to the banknotes issued by the provincial banks, there are also various types of substitute coupons issued by industrial institutions. Although the number is not large, the disruption of paper money is extremely harmful. The process of sorting out and investigating is underway, and reform measures are being prepared for submission to the Ministry for adoption. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Silver Export Issue</h3>
<p>Prevention methods under consideration (Nanjing) The authorities are considering methods to prevent the export of silver. According to financial sources, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi is currently convening leaders of the silver industry in Lu to discuss everything, and a solution may be determined in the short term. Someone asked Tang Youren, a former official with expertise in economic issues, about the government's attitude towards the export of silver. Tang said that the government had no plans to prohibit silver exports or impose taxes, which can be proven by Finance Minister Kong's remarks. Our country is not a silver-producing country but a silver-consuming country, and its self-reliance is inevitably weaker. However, under such circumstances, the government should devise the most appropriate and stable countermeasures to stabilize social finance. If silver exports are prohibited, the most difficult aspects will be: (1) The exchange rate between domestic and foreign currencies will be very different; (2) The difference in silver prices at home and abroad will affect commodity prices. These two points alone are enough to disrupt the financial market. The way to save the situation is to start from the root, and the government is conducting thorough research into such methods. (20th Dispatch) (Nanjing) Industry Minister Chen Gongbo said that the export of silver has a significant impact on industry and commerce, and the Ministry of Finance should have prepared measures. Minister Kong has already made statements on this matter, and he is temporarily unable to express his views. The Ministry of Industry has studied this issue and has drafted a plan, but he has a few opinions that need to be discussed in detail with Minister Kong after he returns to Beijing.

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Bonds Use</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Jiangsu Province issued 30 million in public bonds, as reported in this newspaper. The Executive Yuan handed it over to the Ministry of Finance for review and preliminary planning of its use, with 14 million yuan to repay old debts and 16 million yuan to be allocated to the Huaihe and Yunhe projects and other purposes. The collateral fund is the Jiangsu Ya Tie tax and the salt jin surtax, and the repayment period for old debts will be extended by 19 years. However, this amount may not be sufficient for allocation. In addition to using the conscription system for the Huaihe and Yunhe projects in order to save money, the provincial government will also allocate 300,000 yuan of land tax annually to supplement it.

<h3>Andong Becomes a Marshland</h3>

On Saturday night, 80 percent of Andong was under water. Heavy rain continued to fall on Sunday, all day long. Two reservoirs were destroyed, and the residents suffered even more, flocking to higher ground or rooftops for temporary shelter. According to the latest news received here, there are still 12,000 houses under water, worth about 6 million Japanese yen, and 750 small boats and five bridges have been destroyed. According to news from the area, the river rushed into the city with great force, collapsing hundreds of houses. At that time, the people in the houses were all living on the rooftops or gathered on the upper floors, and they all perished in the water along with the houses. Many fishermen and their boats also sank. The city suffered from a water shortage due to the destruction of the reservoirs, and the victims were in urgent need of water. If relief is not provided quickly, many people will die. This morning, traffic has been restored. The rain stopped last night, and some of the water in the city has receded slightly. Later, the trains were able to run again. It is reported that the authorities are now rushing to transport food and drinking water to relieve the victims. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Reflections on the German National Referendum Result, by Heng</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's news, Hitler has been elected as Germany's sole leader with 90% of the vote. This development was anticipated by us. This time, there was no competition from an opposing party, nor were there other candidates from the ruling party. Voters also had no choice in the matter. It was easy to concentrate the votes on him. In addition, the Nazi Party's propaganda has always been known for its efforts. This time, the propaganda campaign was particularly enthusiastic. Not content with radio and airplane propaganda, countless Nazi Party members gathered in teams to parade, singing tragic war songs to arouse the public's attention and cater to their sense of self-importance and desire to win.</p>
<p>In addition, the Nazi Party members used the will of the late President Hindenburg as an excellent means to appeal to the people. In his will, Hindenburg praised Hitler extensively. Even his son made every effort to promote Hitler after the fact, claiming to be continuing his father's legacy. However, the authenticity of the will remains a matter of much speculation. Hindenburg always maintained a detached attitude towards political views during his lifetime. He was a man of few words and did not speak lightly. Even when he ran for president for the second time, he did not make any grand pronouncements. How could he suddenly have a will of several thousand words just before his death to promote his former political enemy? However, since the Nazi Party regards this will as a rare commodity and engages in propaganda, many ordinary people naturally believe in its content without investigating the truth.</p>
<p>We must know that Germany today is covered with spies and the public opinion is controlled. The words and deeds of important figures, if they are beneficial to the current rulers, are good materials for the Nazi Party's propaganda. If they are detrimental to the current rulers, not only do they have no opportunity to speak, but they are also in danger of being monitored and imprisoned. Therefore, all criticisms of the current German rule have long been unable to exist in Germany, and criticisms from abroad can only reach the outside world and cannot directly reach the ears of the Germans. In this way, the Nazi Party's achievements, good and bad, are all subject to the Nazi Party's propaganda. They take credit for their successes and blame their failures on their predecessors. The people are constantly deceived and manipulated, so what value can there be?</p>
<p>Now Hitler is the sole leader of Germany. What kind of restrictions will be placed on his power is a matter of great concern. If his power is restricted by the party, then his dictatorship is still the dictatorship of the Nazi Party. However, according to the facts, the Nazi Party was created by Hitler alone. Party members must first take an oath of absolute loyalty to Hitler personally before joining the party. The Nazi Party members have an obligation to obey Hitler, but Hitler does not have to be responsible to the party members. From this point of view, Hitler's dictatorship as the head of state will be a personal dictatorship. Even Mussolini and Stalin will humbly admit their inferiority.</p>
<p>However, according to yesterday's news, there were still more than four million people in Germany who voted against him. Nearly two million people abstained, and more than 800,000 ballots were invalid. In total, there are no less than seven million people who are dissatisfied with Hitler. These seven million people were able to maintain their freedom of opinion in the environment of one-sided propaganda by the Nazi Party, which is truly commendable. If Hitler can truly be impartial and patriotic, why not give these people the opportunity to criticize freely, so that they can express their true views?

<h3>A Song Flattering Japan, A False National Anthem</h3>
<p>Lyrics written by traitor Zheng Xiaoxu</p>
<p>Puyi's wife sings and records</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Puyi secretly claimed the title of Emperor, the traitor Zheng Xiaoxu wrote a song for the puppet Manchu Empire to curry favor with the Japanese. The lyrics were extremely absurd. The Japanese liked the lyrics for their submission, so they ordered a musician named Toto Shuyo to compile it into sheet music and distribute it to primary and secondary schools in the three northeastern provinces, forcing students to sing it. The Japanese wanted to popularize this song among the people, and discussed having Puyi's wife sing the national anthem, and Fangzi, the daughter of Prince Gong, sing the Japanese translation of the song, both of which were recorded by the Japanese Columbia Phonograph Company. In addition to broadcasting it on the radio every day, they also forced merchants to buy and sing this record to promote it. Currently, a relative of a certain important person in the Northeast who has recently returned to Beiping from Shenyang has brought this record with them. The record says "Empress sings the national anthem of the Manchu Empire, a trial singing". The melody is decadent and demoralizing. (20th Dispatch) Legislative Member Shi Shangkuan</p>

<p>Commercial Market Declines and Banditry Arises</p>
<p>Early Rice Harvest in Wenzhou and Taizhou Uncertain</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Various parts of Zhejiang Province have now been significantly affected by the drought. The county and town markets are becoming increasingly depressed and exhausted, with more and more shops closing down. In addition, bandits have recently appeared in various counties that previously had no banditry, engaging in kidnapping and looting. In the western part of Pujiang, which previously had no banditry, more than ten armed bandits suddenly came to Wangdu Village in the countryside last night, carrying out arson and looting. Because more than ten families in the village were tenant farmers and self-cultivating farmers, there was nothing to rob, so they kidnapped one person before leaving and set fire to all the houses in the village to vent their anger. Two women were burned to death. This kind of news about rural bandits proves that the future of public security is deeply concerning. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The previous report stated that the early rice harvest in Wenzhou and Taizhou was the only one in Zhejiang Province that could be abundant despite the drought.

<p>More Than 36 Million Germans</p>
<h3>Voted in Favor of Hitler</h3>
<p>More Than 4 Million People Opposed</p>
<p>Increased by One Fold Compared to Last Year</p>
<p>(Berlin) The final results of the national referendum are announced as follows: 38,362,760 votes in favor of Chancellor Hitler concurrently holding the powers of the President, 4,294,654 votes against, and 872,296 invalid votes. (20th National Society Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German people held a public referendum yesterday. According to reports obtained early this morning, the vast majority of those who voted in favor of Hitler concurrently holding the two positions of president and chancellor. At one o'clock this morning, reports of the number of votes from all over the country, except for a very small number of areas, had been received. Although the number of those who voted in favor this time accounted for the vast majority, it was actually the first setback after the National Socialist Party came to power, because the number of votes against it has doubled compared to the public opinion sought by Hitler in November last year regarding his foreign policy. However, observers all believe that although the number of votes against has increased, it cannot be inferred from this that organized opposition to the National Socialist Party has occurred. It can only prove that the people are now somewhat dissatisfied with the policies of the National Socialist Party, and that more than 4 million people are not afraid of the warning from the leaders of the National Socialist Party that opponents will be driven out of the country, and still dare to express their disapproval. When the vote count began, it could be seen that the people's opinions were not as consistent as in mid-November last year. After midnight, the number of votes in favor had fallen from 90 and a half percent to about 80 percent. This kind of shrinking phenomenon is common in all regions of the country. The total number of voters is about 78 percent of all eligible voters. Hitler himself did not vote and spent the whole day inspecting reports from various places in the Chancellor's residence. In front of the voting places in various places, it was very crowded in the early morning, and the crowd gathered in front of the Chancellor's residence, cheering loudly, demanding to see Hitler's demeanor. (20th National Society Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It seems that a large number of voters in the capital participated in the referendum. The voting procedure is as follows: every voter enters the polling place after verifying his identity, receives a ballot and is isolated from the crowd, selects one of the two boxes (yes) or (no) on the ballot and draws a cross, then seals the ballot and hands it over to the executive officer to throw it into the ballot box. After the event, the voters each receive a certificate to show that they have fulfilled their duties. President Hindenburg often went to Rudolf's cafe to vote during his lifetime. Today, many people from other provinces went to vote there to show their admiration for the President and were proud of it. The polling places for Propaganda Minister Goebbels and Interior Minister Frick were also in the cafe. Hess, Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Socialist Party, voted in Sengcheng. Foreign Minister Neurath voted in Lanferden City, Waldenburg. Hitler (leader and chancellor) was originally said to have participated in the voting, but according to a statement by the German News Agency, Hitler did not participate, but all his staff voted. In a small town in the Turingen region, an old woman of 102 years old voted in favor of Hitler. The governor of the place sent a telegram to congratulate her upon hearing the news. About 10,000 residents of Sengcheng went to the station to vote, and there were 25 bands playing music in front of each polling place, which excited the listeners. It is said that 96 voters in Hindenburg's former villa in Neutke City voted in favor of Hitler. (19th Havas Dispatch) Hitler's Momentum</p>
<h3>This Year Not as Good as Last Year</h3>
<p>More opposition votes in large cities, more bought votes in small cities. (Berlin) According to official sources, the preliminary results of yesterday's referendum are as follows: Total number of eligible voters: 45,473,635, of which within Germany: 42,272,012, abroad or traveling: 3,201,623. Total votes cast: 43,529,710, of which in favor: 38,362,760, against: 4,294,654, invalid votes: 872,296. According to the first referendum held on November 12th last year, to test public support for the National Socialist Party's policies, the total votes cast were 41,262,622, with 38,567,825 in favor, 1,953,735 against, and 741,082 invalid. Comparing the two results, although the total number of votes cast increased by more than two million, the number of supporters actually decreased, while the number of opponents greatly increased. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Although Hitler won a great victory in this referendum, it revealed that at least seven million people in Germany distrust him. The number of "no" votes was 4,275,248, invalid votes were 868,543, and those who did not vote were 2,034,846. The authorities exerted severe pressure on the people to vote, and did not allow any opposition propaganda. Therefore, these figures are noteworthy. Although the number of eligible voters increased by 23,966 compared to the general election in November of last year, the number of votes in favor of Hitler decreased by 1,531,194. The majority of "no" votes came from large cities, with as many as 500,000 in Berlin alone, and 167,990 in Hamburg. Hitler recently gave speeches in these two cities, appealing for public support, yet this was still the result, which is also noteworthy. However, the majority of small towns voted "yes," fearing the disclosure of voting content and feeling that Hitler's agricultural policies were still somewhat satisfactory. Ambassador Papen to Austria returned to Berlin from Vienna to vote. Propaganda Minister Goebbels ordered the nation to celebrate Hitler's great victory by displaying flags today. German Archbishop Müller claimed that Judaism is the enemy of Christianity, and Hitler is fighting against Jews, so Christians also support Hitler to achieve the victory of Christianity. ((Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Although Hitler can be said to have received a majority of supporting votes, it is less than the result obtained in the general election held in November 1933. At that time, he received the support of 92.1% of voters. The number of invalid votes this time is unusually high, and it is widely believed that most of them should be regarded as "no" votes. 95.7% of eligible voters participated in the voting. 89.9% of the votes cast supported Hitler, and 10.1% opposed him. Reports from several districts have not yet arrived, but they will not affect the results. (Havas dispatch, 20th) Hitler's speech.</p>
<h3>Do Not Forget to Recover the Saar</h3>
<p>Brown Shirts March with Torches to Celebrate. More than Double the Votes of Hindenburg. (Berlin) Premier Hitler this afternoon gave a short speech at the headquarters to the Germans in the Saar region, stating that after the Germans expressed their unity in yesterday's vote, he said that the German people hope that the Saar region will return to Germany, just as the people of the Saar region hope to return to their motherland. Germans who have to be scattered due to treaty relations must stand on the same front. Therefore, the entire German people will pray sincerely when the Saar region holds a vote on January 13, 1935, expecting that the grievances of the people of the Saar region can be resolved. The Germans respect treaty revisions, and what the Germans ask is only that other countries also respect treaty revisions. Hitler finally said that one of his most glorious days will not be to welcome the people of the Saar region who are now in Berlin, but to set foot on the land of the Saar for the first time. (National Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the news of Hitler's victory was first announced, the Brown Shirts immediately held a torchlight parade. 14,000 Storm Troopers gathered at the Tempelhof airfield and formed a line, holding torches, led by military bands, heading straight to the Prime Minister's Office. Hitler paid his respects, and the crowds gathered on the roadside, cheering enthusiastically, the likes of which had never been seen before. Officials announced that Propaganda Minister Goebbels and Interior Minister Frick voted near their respective ministries, and other ministers also voted. Papen returned from Vienna to vote, while Hitler did not vote. (National News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German people have now approved by an overwhelming majority Hitler's concurrent positions as President and Premier, and as the head of Germany. This matter has become a hot topic of discussion in German newspapers. Congratulatory messages are constantly being sent to Hitler's private residence. Hitler gave a speech in Hamburg, but the voting results there were the most unfavorable, with only 79.7% voting in favor and 20.5% against. But we must understand that Hamburg is a major commercial port and has been most severely affected by the economic decline. In Berlin, 81.5% voted in favor and 5% voted against. The newspapers all pointed out that Hitler received twice as many votes as Hindenburg received in his last election as president. The final results announced this morning are as follows: 38,362,760 votes in favor, 4,294,654 votes against, and 872,296 invalid votes. There were a total of 45,473,635 eligible voters. From this, it can be seen that Germany will be stable in the future. (National News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Voting Arrangements Were Thorough</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The national referendum in Germany to decide the merger of the offices of President and Premier into one person, Hitler, ended at 8 PM tonight. Hitler has achieved a very expected victory, with approximately 90% of the votes cast in favor. The enthusiasm of the people across the country to participate in the voting was unprecedented. There were also several conveniences for travelers in this vote. One was that travelers could vote at the station. For example, at Munich Station, no less than 10,000 people voted before 11 AM. The second was the voting of overseas residents. Anyone who was not from their hometown could receive a special guest residence vote. As many as one-fifth of the people in Munich received and cast guest residence votes, and the number of people in Saxony who received and cast guest residence votes reached 130,000. The third was that most Germans living abroad also returned to the country to vote. The railway authorities provided all kinds of conveniences for these people, and most overseas residents returned to the country in the early morning to vote, and then spent the whole day lingering in the mountains and rivers. Some overseas residents even set sail by boat to vote on the sea three miles away, combining obligation and entertainment in a moment. A telegram also came from Hong Kong reporting that all Germans there set sail on the North German Lloyd shipping company's Bremen in the early morning of that day to vote at sea. Although the people of the Saar region were unable to participate in the voting this time, the residences of German nationals in the area were hung with national flags to celebrate the event. German expatriates living in the area crossed the border to vote. Munich is Hitler's base of operations for many years, and today's grand occasion can be said to be unprecedented. The entrances of all polling stations in the area were decorated with pine branches and portraits of Hitler. At dawn, 25 military bands paraded through the streets of the city to wake up those who were sleeping and make them fulfill their obligations to the country. Prisoners with the right to vote in prisons and hospitals and factories all had special conveniences for voting.

<h3>French Newspapers Say Hitler Lost Power</h3>
<p>(London) Today, British newspapers criticized the German referendum, saying that the number of Germans who voted against it was quite large, which was unexpected. The News Chronicle reported that German Propaganda Minister Goebbels also regarded this as a sign of internal corruption, but the Daily Telegraph said that the propaganda of the German referendum was meticulous, which political organizers elsewhere would envy and regard as the norm. The Manchester Guardian said that most Germans believe that if they do not support Hitler, they will suffer disaster, so they have to vote for Hitler. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, French newspapers said that the German public vote did not enhance Hitler's prestige. The Echo de Paris said that the purpose of Germany's holding a public vote was to enhance Hitler's prestige in the eyes of foreigners, but today's results show that Hitler has lost his prestige. Le Matin said that although Hitler has lost some of the public's adoration, he has consolidated his political position. (Reuters dispatch, 20th) Unofficial Announcement from Soviet Russia</p>
<h3>Preparing to Join the League of Nations Next Month</h3>
<p>France Exerts Effort to Mediate. Britain and France Guarantee Passage at the Assembly. Poland Still Needs to be Persuaded. (Geneva) Responsible sources declared today that the Soviet Russian government has unofficially notified the League of Nations of its preparation to join in mid-September. It is heard that the Soviet Russian notification was conveyed to the League of Nations by the French government. France contacted the League of Nations and Soviet Russia on this matter during the initial negotiations. Britain and France have guaranteed that Soviet Russia will be elected as a member of the League of Nations. Most well-informed leaders in Geneva believe that the reason why Soviet Russia joined the League of Nations is to obtain the greatest assistance from the League of Nations member states when Soviet Russia has a conflict with Japan in the East or with Germany in the West. The reason why Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations has not been decided is only a matter of procedure, such as the military expenditures to be paid by Soviet Russia and the unresolved appointment of Soviet Russian officials to the League of Nations. The annual fee to be paid by Soviet Russia will be 3 million Swiss francs, only exceeded by Britain. However, Soviet Russia can obtain several important positions in the League of Nations. It is learned that the Soviet Russian government does not want to formally request to join the League of Nations until it has determined to conclude the Eastern European Locarno Treaty. Therefore, France is intensifying its pressure on Poland on the one hand and revising the treaty on the other, so that Poland agrees. This convention is considered important by both France and Russia. France is now also trying to get Poland to withdraw its request to follow Soviet Russia and obtain a permanent seat on the Executive Council of the League of Nations.

<h3>Japan Believes Soviet Russia Violated the Agreement</h3>
<p>Hirota Plans to Appeal to World Opinion. (Tokyo) When negotiations on the China Eastern Railway were stalled and Japan and Manchuria were watching the situation, the Soviet Russian side suddenly published a detailed account of the negotiations, including the price issue, in Moscow on the 18th in the form of a TASS news agency dispatch. The course of the China Eastern Railway negotiations since June 25th of last year was originally agreed by Japan and Russia not to be published to the outside world, but the Russian side violated this agreement and exposed the content. What is its intention? The Japanese side observes as follows: The current international situation in the Far East and Europe has changed greatly since Soviet Russia proposed to sell the China Eastern Railway last summer, so it decided to postpone the sale temporarily. For this purpose, it promoted the concessions made by Soviet Russia and placed the responsibility for the stalled negotiations on Manchuria. The reason why Soviet Russia rejected Foreign Minister Hirota's compromise was also because of this. Foreign Minister Hirota believes that there is little hope for the future of the negotiations and plans to make public the sincere attitude of Manchuria, and at the same time, to prevent Russian counter-propaganda, he will take appropriate measures. (Japan League dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Izvestia published an article on the suspension of negotiations on the sale of the China Eastern Railway, and the recent arrest of Soviet railway staff members indicates that the Japanese and Manchurian authorities have intensified their slander and sabotage propaganda. The newspaper commented on the accusations made by the Japanese and Manchurian authorities against the Soviet side, as well as the facts described in the report by the director of the China Eastern Railway Bureau on the attacks and atrocities suffered by the railway, and said (No one should doubt who directed these actions and who participated in them. No one suspects that Soviet railway staff members of the China Eastern Railway and any Soviet agencies have nothing to do with these actions and atrocities. The rampant slanderous actions of the Japanese and Manchurian side are in line with the departure of the Manchurian representative of the China Eastern Railway negotiations, Dajiao, from Tokyo, which indicates that the negotiations have actually stalled. Japanese newspapers have tried to conceal this fact from Manchurian public opinion, while the Manchurian press reflects the thoughts and wishes of the belligerent group, and threatens the Manchurian government with more direct and frank words to take decisive steps to destroy the essence of Soviet relations. The behavior of the Japanese and Manchurian authorities during the Tokyo negotiations and the measures they have taken for the China Eastern Railway fully demonstrate who has shown an unwillingness to make concessions and who has taken destructive and aggressive measures. At the same time, who should bear full responsibility for the interruption of the sale of the railway and the consequences of this action). (TASS dispatch, 19th) The Stupidity of the British Conservative Party</p>
<h3>Still Says Japan is Friendly</h3>
<p>Mostly Due to Fear of Soviet Russia. (London) Recently, some conservative party members have been advocating for closer ties between Britain and Japan, and this mentality is mostly due to fear of Soviet Russia. Although Soviet Russian policy has changed, the extreme right believes that Russia is still a threat. For example, the Morning Post openly opposes Soviet Russia's joining the League of Nations, saying that the Soviet Russian authorities' entry into the League of Nations is to seek their own interests, especially to deal with the China Eastern Railway issue. It said (Comrade Litvinov, relying on his special talents, wants to make people believe that Soviet Russia is innocent and is being invaded by imperialists, thinking that he can use this to drag Western countries into a war against Japan to help Soviet Russia. This is conceivable, but Geneva may not be so foolish). One of the reasons for the Conservative Party's advocacy of closer ties between Britain and Japan is this, but the main reason is actually economic. They believe that closer ties with Japan will bring more economic benefits. The Daily Telegraph recently published a special supplement to describe the general trend of Japan and Manchuria. From the tone of this special supplement, one can see the economic views of the Conservative Party. Among those who wrote articles for the special issue were Japanese Ambassador to the UK Matsudaira, British Ambassador to Japan Lindley, Baron Wakatsuki, the chief representative of Japan at the 1930 London Naval Conference, Baron Go Seinosuke, chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, and Yosuke Matsuoka, former chief representative of Japan to the League of Nations. Matsuoka wrote in his article (The Anglo-Japanese alliance was abolished ten years ago, and the chaos in Asia began as a result. Both Britain and Japan suffered serious harm, and no other country benefited in any way. If the Anglo-Japanese alliance still existed, most of the unfortunate events of the past ten years would not have happened). Lindley said (Our Britain and Japan have many benefits from being on good terms). After the writings of these people, the Daily Telegraph reporter ended with the newspaper's opinion, saying (If we can truly know and see the thoughts of this country and its leaders, it can only be beneficial and not harmful).

<h3>Rumors of the Restoration of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance</h3>
<p>Denial by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today denied rumors that Britain and Japan are currently negotiating a political agreement. It is said that no talks on negotiating a political agreement or restoring the alliance have been held between the two countries. The rumors originated from the visit of the British Industrial Survey Group to the East, but the group is purely economic in nature and has nothing to do with political events or the recognition of Manchuria.

<h3>American Farmers Reject Japanese People</h3>
<p>The Japanese Government Hopes for a Quick Solution. (Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Mr. Hori, the Japanese Consul in Los Angeles, stating that the Consul requested the Governor of Arizona on the 16th to investigate the truth about the anti-Japanese farmers' incident and to find ways to protect Japanese residents. At the same time, he dispatched a candidate Consul, Fukushima, to the state. According to the Consul's report on the 17th, farmers in Phoenix resumed extreme demonstrations on the 17th, forcing the Japanese association to leave before the 25th. Currently, the state governor is traveling and has not returned. He is currently negotiating with the local Attorney General, asking him to find ways to calm the situation. The causes of this riot are generally no more than the following three points: First, American farmers are all in the vortex of economic panic, while Japanese farmers are relatively stable, and this misconception arises. Second, elections are held in various places in the state on September 11, which is the pre-election campaign of the candidates. Third, recently, there have been unfounded rumors that Japanese farmers in California will move to Arizona on a large scale. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now awaiting the report from the Consul there, and is doing its utmost to guard against the trend of serious incidents. It hopes that this matter can be explained locally, and especially hopes that American local officials will take fair measures so that this matter can be resolved quickly. It is very much anticipated. (Japan League dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Exploration of the Stratosphere</p>
<h3>Gained Important Scientific Results</h3>
<p>Viennese stratosphere explorer Professor Piccard stated today that although this ascent failed to break the world record, the scientific results obtained are very important. Piccard landed in Yugoslavia at 9 PM on Saturday. A U.S. News Agency staff member went to talk to him. It is said that all the machinery in the balloon was not damaged when it landed, and all the records obtained were complete and intact. The highest point reached was 16,000 meters, and no new ascent record was created. Therefore, the previous telegram, which stated that the balloon rose to 22,000 meters, has been proven to be a forgery by others. Piccard also said that they stayed in the air for a long time, so the scientific results obtained are more important than previous stratosphere explorations, and the most important is the use of cosmic rays to control the balloon's actions. Piccard will publish all the results of this ascent later. (National News Agency dispatch, 19th) Professor Cosyns, who went up to the stratosphere in a balloon from the capital of Yugoslavia yesterday and landed in the village of Jialafuji in the south of the country this morning, stated today that because he inspected the actions of cosmic rays and the results of certain elements, he has made great gains in science, but it will take some time to compile the results before they can be studied in more detail. The balloon taken by Professor Ke drifted in the air for 15 hours, flying over Central Europe, and only landed on the ground at 9 AM this morning. The villagers were greatly surprised when they first saw the huge object descending from the sky. After learning that it was a balloon, they happily rushed to help tow it. Professor Ke and his assistant looked quite tired, but were surprised to have flown to the south of the country. The wireless equipment in the balloon was malfunctioning and could not communicate with the radio station, so they did not know which country they were in. This time, the balloon flew to a height of 15,000 meters. (Reuters dispatch, 19th) Roosevelt Still Trusts</p>
<h3>The Policy of the Recovery Administration</h3>
<p>(Washington) The order issued here today by President Roosevelt appointing General Johnson as Director of the Recovery Administration is interpreted as an indication of the government's continued support for the Recovery Administration's policies. Although Johnson has been attacked by all parties in recent months, the presidential order shows that he still has the president's trust, so his position has become more consolidated. After the reorganization of the Recovery Administration, he will probably be appointed as the chairman of the committee. However, according to the opinion of general observers, all the candidates for the committee members were originally proposed by Johnson, and they will be selected from outside the current organization. Therefore, new opinions will probably be added to the Recovery Administration. According to the expectations of some leaders in the office, various industry regulations will be overturned, because all parties say that these industry regulations favor large industrialists, which has been severely criticized. It was rumored some time ago that Johnson would resign soon, but the presidential order has dispelled this rumor. Johnson also stated today that the reorganization of the Recovery Administration has made great progress and can be completed in about two weeks. (National News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>The Highest Peak in Europe</h3>
<p>(TASS Moscow correspondence, July 25) Mount Elbrus is the highest peak in Europe and is located on the crest of the Caucasus Mountains. The two continents of Europe and Asia are bounded by this. Now hostels and huts have been set up on both sides of the mountain path to facilitate tourists to climb high. At the same time, orders have been given to carry out various scientific observations. Mount Elbrus was rarely seen before climbing. The first person to climb to its crest was British Mr. Freshfield (1868). From then until the October Revolution, only about 50 people climbed this peak, and most of them were not Russian. After the establishment of the Soviet regime, travel became more popular, and mountaineers paid attention to the peak. The first climb was in 1925, led by Nikolai, with 18 participants. The second time was in 1929, with 17 participants. In that year, the proletarian tourist group set up a heating station at a height of 4,200 meters, which could accommodate 25 people. Therefore, climbers felt greatly convenient, because they could rest here for two or three days to gradually adapt to this height. Last year, the number of climbers totaled 104, setting a new record. This year's plan will far exceed last year's. In August, the Red Army had 250 climbing teams climbing this peak. At that time, the second climbing competition will be held. In the first ten days of August, an international climbing competition will be held. The Soviet Foreign Travel Agency is building a small hostel at the foot of Mount Elbrus. At the same time, a small room has also been built at a height of 16,490 feet on the mountainside to facilitate climbing.</p>

(National Telegraph, 20th) Hindenburg's Will</p>
<h3>Believe It Or Not</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Central European correspondent for the Parisian newspaper "Paris Soir," with reservedly published text, stated that he had thoroughly investigated the will of Hindenburg. There are various versions circulating, one of which is considered most credible due to its reliable source. This version states that Hindenburg's true will was only witnessed by nine individuals: Hitler, Goebbels, von Papen, Hindenburg's son Colonel Oskar, the deposed Emperor Wilhelm II, the deposed Crown Prince, the deposed Emperor's fourth son Prince August Wilhelm, General Jarusch, and the Presidential Secretary-General Meissner. The published version has its third part forged. Meissner's involvement in this matter is attributed to Hitler's considerable efforts, making him a key figure. Not only was a part of Hindenburg's will forged, but also many deletions and alterations were made to the preserved original part. The original will strongly urged the German people to restore the monarchy, electing a member of the former royal family as president to pave the way for restoration. Hindenburg also proposed that von Papen be responsible for preparing for the restoration of the monarchy. National Socialist Party members had long been aware of Hindenburg's intentions. The reason for attempting to kill von Papen during the June 30th coup was due to this. Von Papen's survival was thanks to General Fritsch's rescue, as Hindenburg had told Fritsch that von Papen was of great importance to Germany's future. Von Papen later swore an oath to Hitler, stating that he would never reveal the secrets of the will, which is why he has been able to preserve his life and position. As for the Hohenzollern royal family, they fear the confiscation of their property, so they remain silent. Before the publication of Hindenburg's will, someone warned the deposed Emperor's fourth son that if he leaked any information about the matter, the royal family would be in danger. The Presidential Secretary-General Meissner was responsible for warning other members of the Hohenzollern royal family. A copy of Hindenburg's true will was sent to Doorn (the residence of the deposed Emperor in the Netherlands) by Empress Hermine. Someone immediately notified the Empress by telephone, instructing her not to disclose it. Hindenburg's son, Colonel Oskar, participated in the alteration of the will. Therefore, on the day of the President's death, Oskar handed over the original will to Hitler, who ordered him to keep it strictly confidential. (Havas News Agency, 19th)</p>

<h3>Setting Up Card Stations Sequentially at Various Ports</h3>
<p>The Gubekou Sub-Station Will Be Established Within the Day The Remaining Sub-Stations Are in Preparation (Beiping Correspondence) After the problem of through train service between Beiping and Shenyang is resolved, the measures for setting up card stations at various passes of the Great Wall will be implemented. It has now been decided that the Gubekou Sub-Station will be established on the 22nd. Personnel will also be dispatched by the Jixian District Commissioner's Office to prepare for the establishment of sub-stations at Xifengkou, Lengkou, Jielingkou, and Yiyuan Kou. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Gubekou Sub-Station has been scheduled to be established on the 22nd. Zhang Yongnian, Deputy Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, believes that after the Gubekou tax card station collects taxes, imported goods will be smuggled through other passes. Therefore, he is actively preparing for the establishment of card stations at Xifengkou, Jielingkou, Lengkou, and Yiyuan Kou. The candidates for the heads of the four stations have all been internally determined and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review and approval. The appointments are expected to be announced this week. The establishment of card stations at each pass will proceed sequentially from Xifengkou eastward. It is reported that after the establishment of the tax card stations at each pass, whether Chinese or Japanese merchants transport goods, they must pay taxes in accordance with regulations. Those who violate the regulations will be severely punished.</p>
<p>The sub-stations at various passes of the Great Wall are under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Customs. Yesterday, Tianjin Customs issued a proclamation stating: (According to the order of the Ministry of Finance, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, a customs office for anti-smuggling will be set up at each of the five locations, namely Gubekou, Xifengkou, Lengkou, Jielingkou, and Yiyuan Kou. These offices will be under the jurisdiction of Tianjin Customs. All goods passing through the Great Wall are only allowed to enter and exit through these card stations. The order must be followed. It is also ordered that Deputy Taxation Director Zhang Yongnian be stationed in Beiping to manage the sub-stations at various passes of the Great Wall in the Tianjin Customs district. For these reasons, Yongnian has established an office in Beiping to manage the sub-stations at various passes of the Great Wall in the Tianjin Customs district and has dispatched personnel to each pass to prepare for the establishment of sub-stations. The Gubekou Sub-Station is now ready and will be established on the 22nd of this month, starting its operation. From that date, all goods passing through the pass must go to the card station to declare and be inspected in accordance with regulations. Those who are required to pay taxes must pay customs duties separately in accordance with the tax collection methods of the sub-stations at the various passes of the Great Wall, which are listed below. This proclamation is hereby issued so that all Chinese and foreign merchants and people may be informed).</p>
<p>Interim Measures for Tax Collection at Sub-Stations at Various Passes of the Great Wall: (1) Foreign goods imported through various passes of the Great Wall shall be taxed in accordance with the current import tariff, and in addition to the regular tax, a 5% customs surtax and a 5% disaster relief surtax shall be levied. (2) Foreign goods that have already paid import tax are exempt from tax when exported through various passes of the Great Wall. However, goods suspected of being smuggled in may be detained and submitted for investigation. (3) Domestic goods imported through various passes of the Great Wall shall be taxed or exempted separately in accordance with the current regulations of each customs office for products from the eastern provinces. (4) Domestic goods exported through various passes of the Great Wall shall be released immediately after inspection and verification without any taxation. (5) Merchants of taxable goods shall submit a declaration form to the sub-station. After verification, the merchant shall pay the tax and be released. The declaration form shall be prepared by each card station for merchants to purchase, but merchants may prepare their own in accordance with the prescribed format. (6) All import taxes payable on imported goods shall be collected in customs gold units in accordance with the provisions of the import tariff. However, merchants may pay taxes in national currency according to the gold unit conversion rate announced by the customs office on a daily basis. Other banknotes will not be accepted. (7) After the merchant has paid all taxes, the card station will issue a payment certificate as proof of tax payment. The certificate must not be separated from the goods and must be presented for inspection immediately when encountered by inspectors along the way. (8) Merchants shall fill in the declaration form truthfully when submitting it to the card station. If there is any underreporting or concealment, once discovered, they will be punished in accordance with regulations, or the goods will be confiscated. (9) All imported taxable goods with a value of more than 200 yuan shall have a consular-certified manifest. Otherwise, it shall be supplemented at each card station when the goods are imported. Each manifest shall be subject to a fee of five gold units, but it may be paid in national currency according to the gold unit conversion rate announced by each card station on a daily basis. (10) All goods subject to consolidated tax shall pay consolidated tax in accordance with the consolidated tax rate, which shall be temporarily collected by each card station on behalf of the tax authorities. (11) All passenger vehicles arriving at or departing from each pass shall first report to the sub-station for inspection. If they carry taxable goods or passengers' luggage containing taxable goods, they shall submit a declaration form in accordance with the provisions of item 5 and wait for inspection and tax payment. Violators will be punished in accordance with regulations. (12) These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval and promulgation. If there are any unaddressed matters, they may be submitted for amendment at any time. Superintendent Han Linsheng, Customs Commissioner Boss, Deputy Taxation Director Zhang Yongnian (August 18)</p>

<h3>Going to Yikezhao League to Chant Sutras</h3>
<p>Taking the Baotou Route and Transferring There Approximatley A Month (Guihua Correspondence) The Panchen Erdeni, Great Master Hu Guo Xuan Hua Guang Hui, originally planned to transport all the religious instruments stored in the Jiangbailin Temple to Suiyuan, and then proceed to Baotou before going to Yikezhao League to chant sutras. However, due to the earnest invitation of Yikezhao League League Chief Shagdurjab, coupled with the fact that Baotou had already made preparations for receiving the Buddha's visit, yesterday (the 15th) afternoon around 2:00 pm, he led over one hundred and twenty large and small khenpos, guards, and others, still taking the special train prepared by the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau to Baotou. At that time, those who arrived at the station to see him off included the Chairman of the Provincial Government Fu Zuoyi, the Provincial Party Committee members Zhao Yunyi and Ji Shouguang, the Deputy Commander of the Military Police Zhang Jiayi, the Commander of the 21st Artillery Regiment Li Boqing, the Acting Commander of the Mongolian Border Chen Yujia, the Adjutant General of the 35th Army Zhao , the Deputy League Chief of the Merged League Awang, the lamas of various temples in the city, the ancient princes, nobles, and representatives of various agencies and organizations, numbering over a hundred. The military and police authorities had previously assigned temporary posts along the road from the Suiyuan Hotel to the railway station, taking extremely strict precautions. The area around the platform was also heavily guarded by the police and military police. In addition, there was a company of infantry from the 35th Army, a company of artillery, the Public Security Bureau's security team, a military police guard team, a police and military police bicycle team, and the 35th Army military band, all standing in formation on the platform to respectfully see him off. After the Panchen boarded the train, Awang first led the various princes, Mongolians, and lamas to board the train to pay homage and present khatas. Then, Chairman Fu and others also boarded the train to bid farewell. Soon, the Panchen sent Fu and others off the train, and the train departed immediately. The Panchen stood inside the train window, frequently nodding to Fu and others to express his thanks.</p>
<p>Before the special train departed, the reporter of the Suiyuan News Agency met with Wang Luojie, the Tibetan Secretary-General of the Panchen. According to him, the Panchen Master originally planned to transport all the religious instruments and items stored in the Jiangbailin Temple completely before proceeding to Baotou. However, due to the repeated urging of the Yikezhao League League Chief Sha Wang and others, coupled with the fact that all the reception matters in Baotou had been prepared, the Master, in order to reduce the anticipation of all parties, hastily left Suiyuan today. After arriving in Baotou, the Master will only rest for one night, and tomorrow he will proceed to Yikezhao League to chant sutras. Chief Zhu (Haishan) and the specialists from the Ministry of Railways responsible for the Master's transportation, Gao Yun and Zhao Tingjie, etc., will escort the Master to Baotou, and tomorrow they will take the original train back east. After returning to Beijing, Chief Zhu will remain in the capital to handle the affairs of the Nanjing Office, while I will stay in Beijing for a short period. Within ten days, I will accompany Anqin Khutuktu and take a ship from Shanghai via the sea route to return to Tibet first, to liaise with the Tibetan side regarding all the measures after the Master's return to Tibet and to prepare for welcoming the Buddha's visit, etc. Furthermore, according to Liu Jiaju, the Secretary-General of the Panchen, the Panchen Master left Tibet in the eleventh year of the Republic of China (1922), and in the interim ten years or more, his footsteps have traversed almost all of China. In recent years, the country has been in great trouble, and the Master has been concerned about the difficulties of the times. He has been in various leagues and banners in Inner Mongolia, engaging in propagating the central government's good intentions to save the country from danger and to secure the frontiers. Now that the Dalai Lama has passed away, the Master, following the central government's wishes and responding to the urging of the Tibetan people, has resolutely returned to Tibet. He will use what he has learned from his inspections in various provinces in the interior over the past ten years as the basis for reforming the Tibetan administration. This time, because the Yikezhao League Chief firmly requested the Master to chant sutras, he is taking the route to the west through the league. After staying in Yikezhao for more than a month, he will begin his journey westward. He will rest briefly in the Alashan Banner in the middle, and then leave Alashan to enter Qinghai. He will wait in Qinghai to see what the results of Anqin Khutuktu and Secretary-General Wang (Luojie) return to Tibet to discuss, and then decide on the itinerary to enter Tibet. However, the traffic on this trip is blocked. Once in Qinghai, he will not be able to take a car. It will take a month and a half to travel from Qinghai to Tibet. The Master is expected to go to Lhasa in Tibet first. (16th)</p>
<h3>Strict Precautions on the Guangdong Border</h3>
<p>Bai Chongxi Goes to the Eastern District to Inspect After the Jiangxi Communists were defeated by the Eastern Route Army at Shuikou, the authorities, in order to take the opportunity to suppress the bandits, have sent a large army to encircle Changting, Ninghua, Huichang and other places in separate routes. As Guangdong Province is adjacent to Fujian, in order to consolidate the border defense and prevent the bandits from fleeing south, strict precautions have been taken. Li Yangjing, commander of the Second Column, returned to the original defense area in eastern Guangdong from the province on the 9th of this month. On the same day, Bai Chongxi, who was staying in Guangdong for medical treatment, also went east with Li, touring the scenic spots of Luofu Mountain and inspecting the defense affairs in various eastern Guangdong areas along the way. Li and Bai departed from Guangzhou on the Guangzhou-Kowloon special train at 2:00 pm on the 9th and arrived at Zhangmutou at 4:20 pm, then transferred to Huizhou. That night, they went to Luofu Mountain and stayed at the Zhongxu Taoist Temple at the foot of the mountain. Bai initially planned to avoid the summer heat in the mountain and stay for a few days. However, due to the large number of tourists, it was inconvenient for him to rest quietly. So, on the 11th, he returned to Huizhou with Li, where he was hosted by Deng Tan, the magistrate of Huizhou County. On the morning of the 12th, they bought a boat outside the east gate of Huizhou and went directly upstream along the Dongjiang River. On the 14th, they arrived at Laolong Town, then transferred to a car to Xingning, inspecting along the way. On the 15th, they were expected to arrive in Meixian and planned to go out to Jiaoling, taking the route through Xunwu to enter southern Jiangxi to inspect the defense affairs on the front line of Yunmenling. However, Bai's trip was kept very secret, but the outside world is firmly convinced of it. (16th) Anhui Provincial Government Sends Personnel</p>
<h3>To Investigate Disaster in Various Counties</h3>
<p>-Issue Instructions for Investigating Drought Conditions- (Anqing Correspondence) Anhui Province is suffering from severe drought and has become a disaster. The current disaster relief issue is nothing more than people's food. The provincial government has established a People's Food Regulation Committee, and branch committees have been established in various counties and districts. Now, in order to understand the extent of the damage and seek solutions, the committee has specially dispatched more than forty members to various counties to investigate the disaster situation. The candidates are assigned by the four departments of the provincial government, namely the Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction Departments, as well as the Provincial Disaster Area Fundraising Committee. The members are scheduled to depart together on the 18th. Ma Lingfu, the acting chairman of the provincial government and the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, specially convened all the members yesterday (the 17th) to give instructions and point out matters to be noted. Ma and Liu Yiyan, the director of the Department of Construction, gave instructions one after another, encouraging them in every possible way. The instructions for investigating the drought conditions in various counties, which were issued, are recorded below:</p>
<p>(A) Matters that each member should pay attention to: (1) Since the beginning of summer, this province has been experiencing an extraordinary drought, and the area of ​​farmland affected is very large. In order to understand the drought situation and seek solutions, members are specially dispatched to various counties for investigation. Each member should deeply understand the intention of the provincial government, properly promote it, carefully inspect, and report in detail. (2) The reports of drought in various counties are often exaggerated, and it is difficult to understand the truth without a thorough on-site inspection. Each member must personally go to the drought-stricken areas to conduct a detailed inspection and report. Those who are involved in falsehoods will be severely punished. (3) The area of ​​each county is vast, the amount of rainfall varies, and the drought conditions are naturally different in severity. During the inspection, a detailed analysis should be made without being general. (4) The provincial government urgently wants to understand the drought situation in each county. After receiving the order, each member must set off within two days. After arriving in each county, they should immediately begin a detailed investigation and complete it as soon as possible without deliberately delaying it and delaying important government affairs. (5) Members should not accept local receptions when they arrive in the county, delaying the time, and should not demand anything from the local area, which violates the prohibition. Violators will be severely punished. (6) During the drought in each county, there are often disputes such as grabbing food and digging dikes to get water. Members should at any time consult with the responsible personnel, properly handle them, and give instructions on how to resolve them nearby. (7) The emphasis of this investigation of the drought situation is on on-site inspections, which is completely different in nature from the autumn harvest inspections in previous years. Special attention should be paid. (8) Members should fill out and submit the attached inspection daily report form every day.</p>
<p>(B) Matters to be investigated by each member (1) Regarding the drought situation in each county and the area affected, each member should fill in each item in accordance with the investigation form and the attached instructions, without any ambiguity. (2) Regarding the food problem in each county, the following points should be investigated: 1. The amount of rice shortage in each county; 2. Where can the rice shortage be purchased from; 3. Whether local rice merchants and private individuals have hoarding and speculation; 4. Whether each county has accumulated grain, and whether there are unscrupulous gentry embezzling and controlling it; 5. Whether each county has already developed a method to regulate food. (3) Regarding the problem of replanting drought-resistant crops in each county, the following points should be investigated: 1. What</p>

<p>The Department of Civil Affairs Proposes Three Measures Approved by the Provincial Government; Agreement to Purchase One Million Dan of Foreign Rice and Dispatch Personnel to Hunan to Procure Supplies. Hankou Dispatch: Following the water and drought disasters in Hubei Province, grain losses have been extremely severe.

Incidents of grain looting have occurred one after another. Even in metropolitan areas like Wuhan, there is a rice shortage. Unscrupulous merchants are taking advantage of the situation, driving prices to more than double their previous levels. The provincial government authorities and the Disaster Relief and Famine Preparedness Committee are paying close attention to this issue. The Department of Civil Affairs has drafted measures to prepare for price stabilization, but the required funds are substantial and difficult to raise. Furthermore, as Hunan and Anhui provinces are simultaneously affected by disasters, the sources of supply and transportation are also facing obstacles. Therefore, on the 14th, these measures were submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for discussion. The measures are divided into three parts: (1) The Disaster Relief and Famine Preparedness Committee will allocate 50,000 yuan from the funds already raised as a deposit to procure rice from Hunan for price stabilization in the province to meet urgent needs and stabilize market prices. Simultaneously, a telegram will be sent to the Hunan Provincial Government requesting exemption from taxes, and a letter will be sent to the Hunan-Hubei Railway Bureau requesting reduced transportation costs to lower expenses. (2) Merchants will be recruited to raise funds and purchase rice from various locations. The provincial government will determine quotas and request the Ministry of Railways to issue free or half-price transportation permits and exempt taxes. (3) Negotiations will be held with various banks to raise funds for the purchase of one million dan of foreign rice, to be imported gradually according to local needs, to ensure long-term supply. A request will also be submitted to the Executive Yuan for exemption from customs duties on the purchased grain. After deliberation by the entire committee, regarding the first item, Commissioner Li Shucheng was nominated, and Section Chief Li Bogang of the Department of Civil Affairs was appointed to take the funds to Hunan immediately to negotiate the matter. The Department of Civil Affairs and the Wuhan Municipal Government were instructed to handle the second item. The provincial government will decide on a date to convene a meeting with the banking community of Hankou to discuss the third item. The Department of Civil Affairs has also issued an order to all counties to investigate the grain reserves and prices in urban and rural areas. The order states: "Since the beginning of summer this year, there have been irregular periods of sunshine and rain, resulting in alternating water and drought conditions. A good autumn harvest cannot be expected, and there is a great fear of food shortage. It is imperative to plan ahead for relief efforts. Therefore, it is hereby ordered that the county magistrate promptly investigate and report the amount of grain reserves in the county's urban and rural areas, how long it will last, whether there is any hoarding or speculation, how much the price of rice has risen in recent months, and how it should be stabilized. A prompt and detailed report is required for review and action." (16th) ——————————————Baoshan</p>
<h3>### Preparations for Luoyang Park</h3>
<p>Luodian Town is the only major town in Baoshan County, with a population of over 50,000. Commerce is also quite developed, but there is a lack of public entertainment and recreational facilities. Local gentry, including Sun Danshi, Qian Peishen, Wang Qingtao, and Sun Yingfeng, have initiated a project to construct Luoyang Park in the east of the town, along the Xiaojing River, on approximately 30 mu of land. The area is surrounded by rivers on all sides, with elevated terrain and old trees, making it a natural and ideal location for a park. A preparatory committee of fifteen members has been formed, and a draft plan has been submitted to the county government for record-keeping. The sources of funding will be (1) using interest from charity funds from pawnshops, (2) transferring assistance from the reimbursement of military advances, and (3) soliciting donations. The preparatory committee, recognizing the practical need for the park, passed a resolution at its fifth meeting to engage gentry like Yu Yaoqiu as supporting members to assist in promoting the project. Construction has reportedly already commenced and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Nanhui</p>
<h3>### Zhou Fenglou Escapes Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Zhou Fenglou, a household in the 81st Tu of the 7th District, was kidnapped by bandits last month and has been missing ever since. After the main suspect in the case, Xu Xinglou, resisted arrest and was killed, his gang panicked. They moved the hostage from the Min Family Ancestral Hall in the 17th Tu of the district to Zhujiaquan in Fengxian County, where they planned to kill him. Zhou Fenglou overheard the plan and, realizing his life was in danger, took advantage of the guards' inattention and rammed his head against the wall to commit suicide. However, the rural walls were old, and the impact caused them to collapse suddenly. The loud noise alerted the neighbors, who gathered and found Zhou Fenglou blindfolded. Realizing he had been kidnapped, they captured the guards and sent them to the Fengxian County government for investigation. Zhou's family was notified and welcomed him back home yesterday. Songjiang</p>
<h3>### High Court Sends Investigator to Investigate the Destruction of the Amusement Park</h3>
<p>The Songhui Amusement Park in this city was vandalized. The owner petitioned the prosecutor's office for a thorough investigation, and subsequently requested a transfer of jurisdiction, which was forwarded to the High Court for review. It has been learned that the High Court has specially appointed Shao Qinzhi, a judge from the Shanghai Local Court, to conduct a secret investigation in Songjiang. Shao arrived in Songjiang from Shanghai at 4 PM on the 18th and stayed at the China Hotel. He inquired in detail about the destruction of the Songhui Park and returned to Shanghai yesterday to report his findings truthfully.</p>
<h3>### Provincial Order Changes Head of Water Patrol Team</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the county's water patrol team has been diligent in apprehending bandits. After being reorganized into a security team, Fei Guanqing was promoted to captain of the water patrol team due to his familiarity with apprehension methods, and many theft cases have been solved. Now, while Fei is away on patrol, the county government has received an order from the Provincial Security Office appointing Lü Jinbiao as the new captain of the county's water patrol team. Lü arrived in Songjiang today. However, as Fei is still on patrol, the handover will be delayed for a few days.</p>
<h3>### Bandit Leader in Pudong Killed</h3>
<p>Su A'mei, the leader of a bandit gang in Pudong, had previously gathered dozens of bandits to rob the Shenhu passenger ships traveling between Jiangsu and Zhejiang. At the end of last month, he robbed firearms from the Ruanxiang Town police station in Fengxian and looted the entire town. Recently, Su and his gang targeted Lu Qinquan, the village head of Xiaozheng Village near Fengjing, who was relatively well-off. They planned to kidnap Qinquan and extort silver. However, He Yixiang, the third squad leader of the second company of the local security team, learned of the plan and led his squad to suppress them. After more than ten minutes of fighting, the bandit leader Su A'mei and three others were killed on the spot. Three pistols and Mauser pistols were seized, and the remaining bandits fled. Changshu</p>
<h3>### County Government Requests Recusal in Yang Qingjiu Case</h3>
<p>Yang Qingjiu, the former captain of the 13th Water Police Team stationed in Changshu, was implicated by a captured bandit from Xiaoxian, who claimed that Yang had colluded with bandits. He was subsequently dismissed from his post and detained by a provincial order. The Suzhou Water Police District and people from Suzhou and Changshu counties made great efforts to save him, but to no avail. After being transferred to the province, it was decided to transfer the case to the judiciary for review and assigned the Changshu County Judiciary as the investigating authority. However, three months have passed, and the case has not yet been transferred to the county. It has been learned that Yang's old illness has recurred, and he has been granted permission by District Chief Wei to seek treatment at the Suzhou Regeneration Hospital. As Yang was previously a captain of the county's team, the local county government has some acquaintance with him and has requested the Suzhou High Court for recusal. However, the High Court has not yet approved the request.</p>
<h3>### County Clerk Arrested and Sent to the Province</h3>
<p>Jia Boqin was accused of bribing the county government with 3,000 yuan in a land case. The provincial government is now investigating, and all relevant parties have been arrested and sent to the province, including Zhou Fuchen, the county magistrate's brother, and Zhang Younan, the director of the Western Treasury Tax Collection. They are currently detained in the Zhenjiang Prison. It has been learned that Zhou Xiejun, a clerk in the county government (the county magistrate's nephew), is also involved in the case. The provincial government has ordered the county government to promptly send him to the province. The county government has dispatched a bailiff to escort Zhou Xiejun to the province on the 19th to await investigation. Suzhou</p>
<h3>### Land Tax Director Accused of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Zhu Xiyun, the director of the Wuxian Land Tax Collection Office, was recently accused by citizens Gu Zhixin and Zhang Shiyi of engaging in private embezzlement and misappropriating over 100,000 yuan in national taxes. They provided detailed evidence. Despite the passage of many days, the supervisory authorities have not taken any action. Yesterday (20th), Li Mutang submitted a petition to the county government requesting a thorough investigation of the case and a public announcement of the findings, stating that the county magistrate should not ignore the matter unless he is complicit. The county magistrate, Wu Qiyun, considered the accusations to be an attack on the county magistrate and, as the matter had been repeatedly reported in the newspapers, abruptly summoned the news reporter Hua Youwen to the Zhongshan Hall yesterday morning during the commemorative week. He took him to the county government and severely reprimanded him. Hua argued that even if the county magistrate was dissatisfied with the newspaper's coverage of the news, he should not take it out on individuals. As a result, the county magistrate, Wu Qiyun, reluctantly released him. However, there is still no news on whether the findings of the investigation into the Land Tax Office's embezzlement case will be made public.</p>
<h3>### Villagers Riot as Autumn Harvest Fails</h3>
<p>On the 19th, over 300 villagers from more than ten villages, including Pufang Village, suddenly gathered at the district office in Zhenze Town, Wujiang County, to petition for relief due to the drought and the failure of the autumn harvest. The district chief was absent at the time, and the villagers' demands were not met. The villagers then proceeded to rob rice from rice shops in the town, wielding hoes and other tools. Police arrived at the scene and opened fire to suppress the unrest. The villagers seized firearms and injured several officers. The situation quickly escalated, and shops closed their doors and went on strike. Yesterday (20th), Wujiang County Magistrate Xu Youchuan personally led the security team and water patrol team to the town. Xu Boying, captain of the 7th Water Police Team, also dispatched the Hengta Third Squad and the Shengze Fourth Squad to patrol the town and maintain security. At 9 AM yesterday morning (20th), a group of villagers went to the home of Qiu Fuqing, the wealthiest man in the town, and stole some clothing, intending to set the house on fire. Fortunately, He Linchun, the deputy commander of the Wujiang Security Team, arrived with his team and dispersed the rioting villagers. The local situation is relatively stable, and no other major incidents have occurred. Wuxi</p>
<h3>### Response Against Land Price Declaration</h3>
<p>Various public law organizations in Wuxi telegraphed the national and provincial governments to appeal for a halt to the land price declaration in cities being implemented in Jiangsu Province. At the same time, Rong Shoujing, Qiu Fu, Ding Yunxuan, Wang Yuqing, and others from the Wuxi native place association in Shanghai also telegraphed various provinces to request a swift cessation to avoid violating the Prime Minister's legacy. The original telegram is as follows (omitted titles): "Having recently read reports stating that Jiangsu Province is implementing land price declarations and that the province has established separate measures, starting with the cities of Wuxi and Nantong on July 1st of this year. Wuxi has always relied on industry and commerce as its lifeline. In recent years, the market has been sluggish, and eight or nine out of ten factories have closed down. Bankruptcies are frequent, and even after repeated price reductions in court auctions, no one is interested. At a time when land prices are low and the drought is severe, the government has graciously issued relief orders. Furthermore, Wuxi city has not yet reached a stage of complete autonomy, and implementing land price declarations at this time seems inconsistent with Articles 8, 10, and 11 of the Prime Minister's Founding Guidelines. Although Zongjing and others are based in Shanghai, they feel deeply concerned and dare to send this telegram. We humbly hope that you will review and order a swift cessation to avoid violating the Prime Minister's legacy. We are extremely anxious and urgent."</p>
<h3>### Silk Industry Tycoon Declares Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>The wealthy merchant Zhou Zhaofu, a giant in the silk industry, owns the Yuchang Silk Factory in Zhouxin Town, which was established by his father, Shunqin, after receiving imperial approval during the Qing Dynasty's Guangxu era. It was the first silk factory established in Wuxi. Later, he successively established the Shenchang and Dingchang factories. His "Xishan," "Songbai," and "Ercuan" branded silk fabrics were sold in Europe and America, earning a long-standing reputation. In recent years, affected by the sharp decline in the silk market, his business has failed, and he has declared bankruptcy. Various banks and money shops have filed lawsuits to recover the huge sums owed, including the Bank of China, the Shanghai Bank, and the Fuyuan, Baokang, and Runhe money shops. The verdict has been issued. The main points are recorded below: "The defendant shall repay the plaintiff 285,484.88 silver dollars, with interest at a monthly rate of 8% from July 1, 1934, until the date of complete execution. If the defendant fails to fulfill this obligation, the following collateral will be auctioned off with priority: 90 pieces of Xishan silk, 6 pieces of Songbai silk, 9 pieces of Ercuan silk, 7 pieces and 35 jin of loose silk, 63,400 yuan worth of Zhejiang silk industry public bonds, and mortgaged property located in Wuxi's Louxiang: six north-facing houses, including twelve two-story buildings, ten back-row two-story buildings, six concrete platforms upstairs, two side-by-side flat-roofed shops facing west, and six west-facing two-story buildings located in Louxiang Suoyihama, with back-row flat roofs and a total land area of three-point-four-two xue, base grain of 0.097 li for Xue Zi No. 342, base grain of 0.02 li for Zhen Zi No. 208, and base grain of 0.017 li for Nos. 22 and 23. The defendant shall cooperate with the plaintiff in registering the mortgage right at the registration office. The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant."</p>
<h3>### Two Underground Opium Pill Production Sites Busted</h3>
<p>Hui Shougen, Zhou Zonglun, Bao Shoufu, Zhou Jieyi, and others, notorious opium pill manufacturers from Zhoutan Bridge in this county, secretly established opium pill manufacturing sites in Hua Dafang Village, Laoren Bridge, in the 3rd district, and in Fengjia Village, selling their products along the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) railway line and in both urban and rural areas of this county for several years without being caught. Yesterday morning, three villagers from the area, Yang Genchun, Gong Wanxiang, and Hua A'pang, reported to the Public Security Bureau in the city. They first went to Bao Shoufu's house and seized manufacturing materials, handing them over to the village head, Zhou Jinhui, for safekeeping. When Inspector Ge and others from the Public Security Bureau arrived in the village, the village head handed over the items one by one. These included 462 opium pills, 11 jin and 3 li of raw materials, and 40 opium pills, 17 empty boxes, and over 20 kraft paper bags seized from Zhou Zonglun's house, two large wooden boards for making pills, and three suspicious letters, which were all taken to the Public Security Bureau in Wuxi. The opium pill manufacturers, including Hui Shougen, had fled in advance upon hearing the news, so they were not arrested.</p>
<h3>### Expansion of the Dike Dispute</h3>
<p>The expansion of the dike dispute at the barren dike in Chenshu Town, the 6th district of the county, which has been repeatedly dug open by Zhou Weisan, the town chief of Gushan Town in Jiangyin, prompted Chenshu residents and the county government to telegram the provincial office, requesting fair handling. However, the Construction Department only relied on the survey report of Engineer Wang, which stated that the need for water in Gushan was indeed a fact. As a result, a telegram was sent temporarily approving the opening. Residents of Chenshu were extremely alarmed upon receiving this order. They stated that after the dike was opened, the waterways of Chenshu had dried up, affecting the drinking water of the townspeople, and the nearby tributaries were dried to the bottom. Six to seven thousand mu of farmland in five towns and villages, Chenshu, Zhangmiaoshe, Xiazhuang Township, Daixiang Township, and Yangjiazhuang Township, were on the verge of destruction. Therefore, it was decided to continue to telegram the province, requesting a return to the original state. Thousands of residents of Chenshu Town will form a group to go to Wuxi to petition various agencies, seeking assistance. At the same time, local groups such as the county party headquarters, the county property office, the county chamber of commerce, the county education association, and the county farmers' association also jointly telegraphed the provincial office, unanimously striving for their cause. According to Yao Pu and Yao Xin Chui from Chenshu, the motive for removing the barren dike was entirely initiated by Zhou Weisan personally. The terrain of Gushan is five feet higher than that of Chenshu, and little river water actually flowed into Gushan after the barren dike was opened. When Engineer Wang conducted the survey, Gushan had a deliberate plan to build a diversion dam upstream to temporarily block the water flow and drain the Gushan waterway, deceiving Engineer Wang and others. Currently, Gushan is afraid that Chenshu townspeople will re-block the dike, so they have sent armed security guards to protect it. The people of Chenshu Town are extremely indignant and advocate taking active action to resolve the matter by force. Judging from the situation on both sides, it is quite serious and could erupt at any moment. It is also rumored that when the dike was built during the Xianfeng period of the late Qing Dynasty in the sixth year, it repeatedly collapsed, and the dragon gate was difficult to close. Later,活 dogs were buried at both ends of the dike, and the dragon gate finally closed. During this excavation, the skin, flesh, and bones of those two 活 dogs were still completely intact and had not rotted at all, which is also a wonder.</p>
<h3>### House Collapse Kills Two</h3>
<p>Shen Genquan, a resident of the back of Zhichu Town West Street along the river in the 9th district of this county (Qingcheng City), was over forty years old and made a living by farming and working as a butcher. He lived in poverty in his house, which consisted of a shop front and a two-story back building. He lived alone, with no neighbors nearby. Unexpectedly, at around 10 PM the night before, the two-story back building suddenly collapsed, burying Genquan's mother, wife, and children inside. Nearby residents awoke from their sleep and rushed out to see the house had completely collapsed. They could faintly hear cries for help from under the rubble. They cleared away the bricks and tiles and found Genquan's wife, covered in blood, already dead. Although his mother had no fatal injuries, she died soon after being rescued. Genquan and his children were injured in the buttocks, hands, and feet, but were not seriously injured. Changzhou</p>
<h3>### County Chamber of Commerce Expands Business Corps</h3>
<p>The Wuyi County Chamber of Commerce, concerned about the recent order to disband the business corps and patrolling teams, sought ways to remedy the situation. They specially requested Qian Yizhen, the commander of the business corps, to promptly reorganize and expand the existing business corps. Commander Qian has already convened the corps for training. The Chamber of Commerce will convene leaders from various industries to discuss and decide on expansion methods within days.</p>
<h3>### Unclaimed Boy Found in Well</h3>
<p>There is a well in the middle of the Sala Alley in Wuyi City, which is used by residents to draw water. However, due to the recent drought, the well has gradually dried up. Residents pooled their resources and started digging yesterday (19th). Unexpectedly, while continuing to dig in the afternoon, they dug out a boy of about six or seven years old. He was immediately pulled out and was still breathing, but unable to speak. No family members have been found to claim him, which is causing astonishment among nearby residents. The police were immediately notified, and the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau was notified to search for his family while he was sent to the Wujin Hospital for treatment. Nantong</p>
<h3>### Nantong Cotton About to Enter the Market</h3>
<p>This year's cotton fields in Nantong, especially in the areas along the Yangtze River and the canal, have benefited from convenient water access, and the cotton seedlings are developing extremely well. Coupled with the unusually hot summer and autumn, the cotton has matured early and is already producing fiber. It is expected that new cotton will enter the market by the end of this month, half a month earlier than in previous years. It is estimated that the overall yield will be about 70%.</p>
<h3>### Special Commissioner's Office Arrests Opium Dealers</h3>
<p>The Nantong District Special Commissioner's Office, concerned about the recent large-scale activities of Xu Ziqing, a well-known opium dealer in Tongcheng, dispatched the Nantong County Security Team to search Xu's residence in Huiminfang. Xu had already fled, but a large amount of opium paste and paraphernalia were seized, along with Xu's nephew, Bo Rong, and both were sent to the county government for interrogation. Luhe</p>
<h3>### Repercussions of Police Officer Assaulting Vegetable Vendor</h3>
<p>Sheng Ziqing, a sanitation police officer from the Public Security Section in this county, is ordered daily to prohibit vegetable vendors from trading on the street to avoid obstructing traffic. Unexpectedly, the other day, two female vegetable vendors were each carrying empty baskets in front of Cheng Yuanji to buy salt. A police officer saw them and rebuked them, ordering them to leave. The two women ignored him because they were buying salt there and not selling vegetables. The police officer then broke their carrying poles and beat them with a rattan whip. Not satisfied, he reported the incident and had the two women and Ding Yuanshan, a partner at Cheng Yuanji, arrested and detained. Seeing this, all the shops were outraged by the police officer's brutality. The shops jointly prepared a document and submitted it to the county, requesting severe punishment for the police officer, Sheng Ziqing, to appease the public. The vegetable vendors also jointly submitted a petition requesting punishment and have gone on strike since today (18th). Waste collectors have also stopped collecting, and the unrest is likely to escalate. Jiaxing</p>
<h3>### Truth Revealed in Agricultural Bank Theft Case</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 15th, Jiaxing County Agricultural Bank discovered that over 41,000 yuan and a package of gold and jewelry deposited by a person surnamed Tu had been stolen. Over the past few days, the police and security forces have paid close attention to the case, and seven suspects, including Feng Xingsheng and Zhi A'si, have been arrested and interrogated separately. Tu Haigen, a worker at the bank, provided a breakthrough, and Zhang Maihe and Tang Xunze from the provincial committee verified the accounts and found a difference of over 9,000 yuan in the funds received from the Ziyuanzhuang. After discovering this major discrepancy, Xu Fukang, the chief cashier, was questioned, and his statements were full of loopholes. Xu was then released on bail. Wu Heshu, the bank manager, aware that the truth was about to be revealed, left Jiaxing for another place on the 19th, and his whereabouts are unknown. His wife and children have also gone into hiding, leaving only an old maidservant at home to guard the doors. The seven suspects who have been arrested were sent to the local branch of the court for interrogation on the 20th. The county government has prepared a large amount of cash to maintain the bank's credit.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Lushan Conference Results</h3>
<h3>Chen Xing and Others Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to reports, the price of silver is reaching a level trading field both domestically and internationally, and traffickers will no longer find a profit. Guowen News Agency reports that Chen Xing, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank; Xi Demao, General Manager of the Business Bureau; Bei Songsun, Manager of the Bank of China; Song Ziliang, General Manager of the Construction Bank Company; Xu Keting, Director of the Monetary Department of the Ministry of Finance; American advisor Locke, Lin Shu, and others, received a telegram from Minister of Finance Kong, and at 2 PM last Saturday (18th), they took a Condor plane (the same plane that Minister Kong previously used to travel to the Northwest) from Hongqiao Airport,</p>
<h3>flew to Guling</h3>
<p>Arriving at Jiujiang before 5 PM, and arriving at Guling at 8 PM where they took residence. After a light dinner, at 9 PM they attended Minister Kong's Villa at No. 51 Guling to discuss the issue of silver exports. On the morning of the 19th, the talks continued. Bei Songsun and Xi Demao in particular, contributed much to the market situation. The conclusion was that Minister Kong</p>
<h3>published a statement</h3>
<p>which was passed on to the Central News Agency. Chen Xing and the other six, with the exception of Bei Songsun, who needed to visit the Nanchang branch of the Bank of China, Chen Xing, Xi Demao, Song Ziliang, Xu Keting, Locke, Lin Shu, returned to Shanghai on the Condor plane on the morning of yesterday (20th) at 8 AM. They arrived at Hongqiao Airport at 11 AM. Yesterday afternoon a Guowen News Agency reporter visited Chen Xing at the Central Bank and spoke to him about</p>
<h3>the journey</h3>
<p>and the situation in the Guling meeting. Chen started by saying, "While President Kong is in Shanghai, he always summoned the important employees of the bank to his personal residence every week to discuss the various department affairs and market conditions. This is a common occurrence. The 18th was a Saturday, with fewer bank affairs. The 19th was again a weekend, so President Kong telegrammed me (Chen calling himself) and Director Xu, Manager Xi, the American advisor etc. The telegram also stated that it would be better if Bei Songsun and Song Ziliang could come along. This was to fly to Guling to report on bank affairs in order to discuss</p>
<h3>silver exports</h3>
<p>This was the precursor to the question. Those who discussed matters in Guling were only Minister of Finance Kong and the seven people mentioned above. To suggest that this was on the summons of Chairman Chiang, is purely outside speculation. It is a matter of fact that Chairman Chiang was not participating. China's import surplus means that merchants are paying in silver, resulting in</p>
<h3>lower silver prices</h3>
<p>Currently, the U.S. is increasing the price of silver, opportunistic speculators believe there is an opportunity to profit and they are not hesitating to engage in large scale exports. Up to today, according to customs reports, the statistics of silver exports has reached</p>
<h3>over 70 million</h3>
<p>This kind of peculiar circumstance has been promoted by rumors. When discussing this matter in Guling, it was believed the outside world rumored the government would increase silver export taxes or prohibit silver exports, the government had no such intention. Therefore, Minister of Finance Kong immediately published a statement to reassure the people, or it could be thought that our country's silver</p>
<h3>is flowing out in huge amounts</h3>
<p>It is especially enough to shake the financial market. This is not a conversation about the root of the matter. Shipping silver out is due to the lower price of silver in our country and the ability to profit. The Chinese silver stored in the foreign merchant bank's treasury, some is from Chinese merchants</p>
<h3>buying US dollars</h3>
<p>First, to allow the receipt to be absorbed. Secondly, to be absorbed by savings. Once the USD received is too high, the import surplus can be offset without having to buy again. At that point the domestic price of silver, should be able to level with the international market. At this point silver can no longer be shipped overseas, because those traffickers, not only</p>
<h3>can no longer profit</h3>
<p>But will simply increase shipping costs, and this is the inevitable trend. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance believes there is no need to implement a ban. Currently the period of time to reach a level trading field between domestic and international silver prices is being researched." Furthermore, according to a Guowen News Agency reporter, recently</p>
<h3>China's Silver Reserves</h3>
<p>A total of approximately 200 million taels. As for the exact amount of silver reserves in this city, last week it was 96,516,000 taels of sycee silver, 388,740,000 silver dollars, and 8,006 bullion bars. At the same time last year, it was 141,040,000 taels of sycee silver, 278,810,000 silver dollars, and 6,360 bullion bars. The above is the</p>
<h3>Mixed Quantity</h3>
<p>of silver reserves in Chinese and foreign banks, among which the silver reserves in Chinese banks were 32,340,000 taels of sycee silver, 248,970,000 silver dollars, and 7,980 bullion bars. At the same time last year, the silver reserves in Chinese banks were 49,270,000 taels of sycee silver, 188,240,000 silver dollars, and 6,002 bullion bars. Meanwhile, foreign banks have been continuously shipping silver to London, and this</p>
<h3>Remains Extremely Active</h3>
<p>The amount shipped out the day before yesterday (the 19th) was worth approximately six to seven million. Yesterday, a certain bank also used three trucks to transport a large batch of silver for customs export clearance. According to those concerned about the financial market yesterday, both Chinese and foreign export merchants should prioritize the overall situation, take into account the stability of the city's market, and should not only aim for profit, creating unnecessary panic and fueling the flames. This will not only affect social finance, but also harm their personal reputation and careers.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Scheduled to go to Nanjing and then to Jiangxi within one or two days. Planned to take a short trip to Beijing and Tianjin, returning to Europe next spring. According to the Central News Agency, Judge Wang Chonghui of the International Court of Justice, who was on leave from Europe since the beginning of last month to return to China, disembarked in Hong Kong and went to his ancestral home in Dongguan. He then took the Grand President steamer of the Dollar Steamship Lines from Hong Kong to Shanghai, arriving here at around 7 PM yesterday. Wang is scheduled to go to Nanjing within one or two days to report to the central government, and then go to Jiangxi to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He also plans to take a short trip to Beijing and Tianjin, and return to The Hague next spring to resume his duties. Wang met with reporters from various newspapers on the ship yesterday and gave an important speech. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Arrival in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang took the Grand President steamer of the Dollar Steamship Lines from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the 18th, entering the port at around 5 PM yesterday and docking at piers 16 and 17 at around 6 PM. After a brief exchange with those who came to welcome him, Wang disembarked and transferred to the Yuebao small steamer to cross the river.

<h3>Subsequent Movements</h3>
<p>According to Wang, he returned to China with Minister Gu and went to Dongguan to visit his family, so he disembarked in Hong Kong and met with Chen Bonan and Hu Zhantang in Guangdong and Hong Kong. Hu does not intend to attend the Fifth National Congress. This trip north was at the invitation of Chiang Kai-shek, so he plans to stay in Shanghai for a day or two before going to Nanjing to meet Chiang Kai-shek, then return to Shanghai and take a short trip to Beijing and Tianjin, returning to The Hague six months later. After arriving in Shanghai today (that is, yesterday), he plans to meet with the members of the Central Committee in Shanghai to inquire about the domestic situation, as he has been abroad for a long time and is somewhat out of touch with the domestic situation.</p>
<h3>International Situation</h3>
<p>Wang continued to talk about the international situation, saying that the changes in the international situation are constantly changing and cannot be fully explained in a few words. At present, the effectiveness of various international treaties, such as the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, is gradually diminishing and cannot strictly bind the actions of various countries. Therefore, countries are both expanding their military preparations and signing non-aggression treaties between two or three or four or five countries. The reason why a small number of countries are signing non-aggression treaties is that they have learned from the complexity of previous international treaties. Wang also said that, according to the current situation in Europe, a second world war will not break out immediately, as the financial resources of various countries are not yet sufficient. However, once war breaks out, who will be the enemy and who will be the ally is unpredictable. The current situation cannot determine the future.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Belief</h3>
<p>As for the belief of European countries in the League of Nations, it remains the same, maintaining each other so that the League of Nations' prestige is not completely lost, because the authorities of various countries know that if they do not maintain the League of Nations, the League of Nations cannot exist and there is no corresponding organization that can replace it. Moreover, the League of Nations has previously resolved all kinds of disputes for various parties and made great achievements.</p>
<h3>Japan-Russia Dispute</h3>
<p>Wang continued to answer reporters' questions, saying that although the situation between Japan and Russia is becoming more dangerous, it is not expected that war will break out immediately, but both countries are actively preparing for military action. Regarding the issue of recognizing (Manchukuo), the resolution of the League of Nations exists, and no country will dare to risk such a great injustice and be criticized by the world. Therefore, he believes that all countries will adhere to the resolution of the League of Nations and not recognize (Manchukuo) to the end. As for the British organization of an industrial investigation team to Northeast China, he cannot determine whether this move has political implications.</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>The reporter then asked Wang for his views on China's diplomatic policy. Wang was unwilling to express any opinion on this, saying only that the diplomatic policy must be divided into two aspects, peace and war, which cannot be discussed in a short time. As for some people who advocate that China's diplomacy has only three paths to take: Geneva, Moscow, and Tokyo, he believes that it is not so simple to solve.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Dispute</h3>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, Wang said that if both China and Japan agree, it can be submitted to the International Court of Justice for resolution, but if one party does not agree, the International Court of Justice has no power to adjudicate.</p>
<h3>Constitutional Draft Opinions</h3>
<p>Wang finally said that he had only seen reports on the initial draft constitution drafted by the Legislative Yuan, and had not yet seen the detailed provisions. He felt that it was too satisfactory and feared that it would be difficult to implement in the future. - Huang Boqiao</p>
<h3>Departing Today for Overseas Investigation</h3>
<p>First to Japan, then to Europe and America. Trip to last a maximum of eight months before returning home. According to the Central News Agency, Huang Boqiao, the director of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, has been ordered by the Ministry of Railways to go to Europe and the United States to investigate railway operations. A reporter from the Central News Agency went to interview him yesterday. Huang was returning to Shanghai from Beijing after visiting Minister Gu. As the departure was imminent, he summoned the heads of various departments and offices to the bureau to instruct them on bureau affairs. He spared time to meet with the reporter and discuss the itinerary of this investigation and the current situation of the bureau in detail. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Investigation Itinerary and Scope</h3>
<p>The reporter asked about the itinerary and scope of this investigation. Huang replied that the original plan was to go from Shanghai to Tianjin on August 11, go to Europe via Siberia, and then to America, and return via Japan. However, after hearing about the floods and plague on the China Eastern Railway, the plan was changed to take the Grand President steamer to Kobe first today (that is, today) to visit the Japanese railways. On the 31st, he will take the Empress of Canada from Yokohama and disembark in Vancouver to visit the Canadian railways, and then go to the United States to visit. On September 30, he will take the German liner Bremen from New York to visit the UK. From the UK, he will go to the European continent to visit the railways of France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Soviet Union, and return home via Siberia. The trip will last at least six months and at most eight months, covering approximately fourteen countries. As for the scope of the investigation, due to the complexity of railway operations, each category requires an expert to conduct a long-term investigation in order to obtain satisfactory results. Therefore, this time, he can only focus on the administrative management aspects of railways based on his position. In addition, the various departments and offices will prepare an investigation outline, part of which is to generally collect reference materials, and part of which is to raise questions about events that the bureau feels are serious on a daily basis, hoping that railway authorities or experts from various countries will provide answers for discussion. However, due to time, economic, and spiritual constraints, the observations obtained may still be superficial and difficult to consider satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Deputy Director Wu Appointed to Act Temporarily</h3>
<p>Huang continued, "This time I am going abroad for investigation, which is a kind of dispatch. The bureau has a deputy director. When the director is away on official business, the deputy director will act on his behalf in accordance with the law. This has been clearly announced by the Ministry of Railways. The current Deputy Director Wu Shaozeng graduated from Jiaotong University and studied in the United States for about ten years, obtaining a PhD in Railway Economics from the University of Pennsylvania. After returning to China, he served in the Ministry of Railways and as a professor at Jiaotong University. Although I did not know Deputy Director Wu before, we have worked together for twenty months and I am very impressed with his knowledge, morality, and dedication to his work. We are in complete agreement in handling official business on a daily basis, so even though I am going abroad, the bureau can continue to operate as usual without any problems."</p>
<h3>Overview of Recent Important Work</h3>
<p>The reporter then inquired about Huang's achievements since taking office. Huang replied that this should be judged by society through careful observation and fair criticism. He dared not boast of any achievements. What he could be confident in was that he had never stopped working faithfully. However, since he and Deputy Director Wu took office, there are one or two points that can be expressed in numbers, which are more accurate. For example, the principal and interest of the loan from the Sino-British Bank, as of July of this year, totaled 7.68 million yuan (of which approximately 1.7 million was allocated by the Ministry of Railways). For example, last year's operating profit was 3.01 million yuan. This year's first half of operations, according to the daily telegraphs of receipts from various stations, totaled 10.13 million yuan, an increase of approximately 670,000 yuan compared to the first half of last year. As a result, the bonds of this railway have a very good reputation in the London market. When I took office in December of the year before last, the minimum value of each 100-pound bond of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was only 40 pounds, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway was only 77 pounds. Later, it gradually increased, with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway rising to 69 pounds and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway rising to 99 and a half pounds. This is by no means the power of me or Deputy Director Wu alone, but the result of the concerted efforts of all parties at home and abroad. The total debt of the two railways is now only 300,000 pounds for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, which can be paid off in about three or four years. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway still has a large amount of more than 2.8 million pounds to be repaid. Because it can be repaid on time, there will be a day of repayment. As for the double-tracking of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, although it is necessary, it is not allowed by financial resources. It is now planned to lay a section from Shanghai to Nanxiang first, and to add passing loops and turnouts in appropriate sections as a remedy. The above plan has recently been approved by the Ministry of Railways and is being rushed to completion. The completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway and the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge are still being reviewed by the Ministry of Railways and there are no concrete facts to report.</p>
<h3>Business Expansion and Increased Employees</h3>
<p>Director Huang also said that the total number of employees in the bureau is approximately 13,300, of which workers account for approximately 90%. This number is almost the same as the population of an ordinary county town, and its distribution range is much larger than that of a county town. At all times, there are changes such as death, advancement, retreat, and transfer, so it is as difficult to obtain the most accurate number at any given time as it is for the local government to handle household registration. However, the number of officers and staff is smaller and easier to assess. From the time I took office until the end of July of this year, excluding the personnel of the police department and the general audit office, whose advancement and retreat are not controlled by the bureau, and the interns graduated from Jiaotong University sent by the Ministry of Railways, approximately 288 people have retired, with a total monthly salary of 43,000 yuan. The new recruits are 270 people, with a total monthly salary of 29,000 yuan. In terms of number of people, there is a decrease of 18 people. In terms of salary, there is a decrease of 13,000 yuan per month. However, the above numbers have now changed. At the same time, looking at the work in the past year and eight months, not counting the internal increase in workload, only counting the newly opened businesses, such as three new railway business offices, one new railway garden hotel, and three new railway hospital clinics, and the capital railway ferry has been opened to traffic, and the national railways have implemented responsible joint transportation, it can be seen that the business has increased and the officers and staff have not increased. However, there is a shortage of field personnel, and soon the Capital Central Station, as well as the connection of Heping Road and the completion of the Sanmin Road branch line of the Songhu Line to the central area of Shanghai, and the double track between Shanghai and Nanxiang mentioned above will be completed. In the near future, the Qiantang River Bridge will be completed, and the entire Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line will be completed, all of which will require sufficient assistants and should be trained in advance. Therefore, the most reliable office has recruited a batch of fifty trainees. In addition, the number of workers has slightly increased, all of whom are the train workers who have been added after handling responsible transportation and joint transportation, which is due to actual needs. I believe that the number of people on this railway is indeed very large, but it has been added continuously over the years, not in one day. Railways are state-owned enterprises that can produce, so if you want to seek development, you should not passively lay off employees and reduce administration, but actively expand business and adjust employees, so that everyone can make the best of their talents. At this point, Director Huang also showed various reports and statistics as proof.</p>
<h3>Rebuilding the Bureau and Establishing Warehouses</h3>
<p>Director Huang also said that the bureau was originally located at the Shanghai North Station, but it was destroyed in the January 28 Incident. Office space has been rented, and a huge amount of rent is paid every month, which is not economical. It is now planned to rebuild a nine-story bureau office on the land east of the station. The funds have been designated and planning is underway, with the goal of completing it within two years. Now, according to the order of the Ministry, warehouses are being built at various stations along the line to facilitate freight transportation. The existing warehouses at various stations are simple and only used to shield from wind and rain. After the bureau was ordered, it organized an investigation team and cooperated with the financial community to conduct investigations in various places. The equipment of the warehouse varies according to the nature of the goods, and its volume must also depend on the amount of production, so it has a direct relationship with production, sales, and transportation. The construction and its volume will be determined based on the results of the on-site investigation. In the future, the construction will be invested by the financial community or the bureau will borrow money to handle it itself. It has not been predetermined. It was previously rumored that negotiations had been made with the banking community to borrow money, but this is a false rumor.</p>
<h3>Old Illness Not Cured, Visiting Doctors for Treatment</h3>
<p>Director Huang is only accompanied by his wife and secretary Luo Yimin on this trip abroad. According to Huang, he has long suffered from diabetes and his diet must be measured by someone. Since last year, his right shoulder joint has been painful when moving, and he often needs help with his clothes, so he cannot but ask his wife to accompany him. However, the investigation travel expenses are only 10,000 yuan, so the funds are quite tight. Secretary Luo Yimin is an Austrian doctor who is currently a professor of foreign languages at Jiaotong University. Dr. Luo is proficient in German, as well as Chinese, Japanese, and English, French, and Italian. I can only speak German. For the convenience of the investigation, I have submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways to order President Li to borrow him for accompaniment, but his task is only to translate and handle documents. It is said that my body will be better every time the weather is warm, so it is still possible to deal with it when going abroad now, but the old illness has not been cured, and as a result, my eyesight has been greatly reduced, and there is a risk of blindness in the future, so this time I plan to visit famous doctors for treatment.</p>
<h3>Cai Zengji Returns from Nanjing</h3>
<p>This trip has nothing to do with the collection of tobacco and alcohol license tax. According to the Central News Agency, Cai Zengji, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, has returned to Shanghai after going to Nanjing for business a few days ago. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the report yesterday that Shanghai must seek other remedies due to the reduction in revenue from the abolition of ship donations, and that the tobacco and alcohol license tax will be levied again in order to gradually eliminate corruption is not accurate. Cai's trip to Nanjing was ordered by the municipal government to attend a certain meeting and had nothing to do with the collection of tobacco and alcohol license tax. The abolition of ship donations is also not a fact. The above news is obviously a propaganda aimed at resisting taxes. As for the issue of collecting tobacco and alcohol license tax, the bureau's position has been published in newspapers many times, and people from all walks of life are aware of it. This time, the collection of this tax is only in accordance with the regulations issued by the Ministry and is not a tax increase. Those who do not comply will be severely punished according to the regulations. If anyone deliberately engages in propaganda that obstructs tax administration in the future, they will be investigated. Zeng Yangfu arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Contacting the Banking Community for Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Government plans to issue 30 million yuan. Negotiating mortgage and issuance methods. And will go to Nanjing to report to the central government. According to the Dagong News Agency, the Zhejiang Provincial Government plans to issue local public bonds of 30 million yuan due to the deficit in the provincial treasury. The public bond regulations and repayment methods have been drafted and are being submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. Zeng Yangfu, the Director of the Construction Department of the province, came to Shanghai yesterday specifically for this matter to contact the banking community in Shanghai to negotiate mortgages and issuance methods. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Issuing Public Bonds of 20 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government decided to issue local public bonds of 20 million yuan due to the severe drought in the province this year, the despair of the autumn harvest, the urgent need for relief for farmers in various places, and to consolidate debts and cope with financial difficulties. The business tax, film tax, and tobacco and alcohol license tax of the province are used as collateral, with a monthly interest rate of eight percent, and are scheduled to be issued on November 1. It is expected that the bonds will be fully repaid by the Republic of China year 28. The use of the public bonds is partly to carry out work relief and provide relief to farmers, and partly to consolidate finance. All public bond regulations, as well as the fund repayment methods, have been submitted to the central government for review by the Legislative Yuan in order to approve implementation.</p>
<h3>Zeng Comes to Shanghai to Negotiate Mortgage</h3>
<p>Zeng Yangfu, the Director of the Construction Department of the province, came to Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday specifically for this matter to contact the banking community in Shanghai to negotiate mortgages or issuance methods. According to the banking community, the banking community said that the issuance of a huge local consolidation public bond by the Zhejiang Provincial Government is too large an amount and cannot be borne by one or two banks alone, so whether to issue or mortgage cash must be decided after consultation with the industry. Moreover, the public bond regulations are still under review by the Legislative Yuan, and it will take time to implement.</p>
<h3>Will Go to Nanjing to Report to the Central Government</h3>
<p>After Zeng has completed negotiations with the banking community, he must go to Nanjing to report to the central government. The general idea is that the province's work relief plan is being carried out step by step in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It is extremely difficult, and the summer of this year was extremely dry, and there was another huge disaster, so the issuance of provincial public bonds is extremely urgent. In order for the central government to have a deep understanding and assistance to the serious disaster in Zhejiang Province, the shortage of tax revenue, and the financial difficulties, the issuance of the public bonds can be smoothly passed and issued as soon as possible, so that the people can be relieved of their pain as soon as possible. Zeng's trip is indeed carrying a major mission.</p>

<h3>Liao Zhongkai Memorial Meeting</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department convened a general meeting yesterday. More than one hundred representatives from all walks of life attended. According to the Central News Agency, August 20 is the anniversary of the martyrdom of Mr. Liao Zhongkai. The Municipal Party Department of Shanghai specially convened all walks of life at 10:00 AM in the auditorium of the Municipal Party Department to hold a memorial meeting for the ninth anniversary of the martyrdom of Mr. Liao Zhongkai. Xing Wan, the chairman of the Municipal Committee, reported the significance of commemorating Mr. Liao, and then shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting. The details are recorded below. Participating representatives included Shen Chunhui of the Municipal Supervisory Committee, Wang Zongjian of the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office, Lin Kecong of the Women's National Goods Movement Committee, Yu Zhenhui of the Municipal Farmers' Association, Long Peiyun of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Wu Guofang of the Wharf Business Office, Zhao Zenghui of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, and more than one hundred representatives from other agencies, groups, and schools. After the chairman reported and performed the ritual, Chairman Xing Wan reported, saying that today we are holding the memorial meeting for Mr. Liao Zhongkai's martyrdom, and the national crisis is intensifying, and the international situation is becoming more tense, which is truly infinitely emotional. Today, the smell of a powder keg can be found almost everywhere in the international arena, and Austria in Western Europe and Manchuria in East Asia are the fuses for the future world war. No country in the international arena is not actively preparing for war. Analyzing from various phenomena, we can find economic and political panic and contradictions everywhere. This kind of panic and contradiction will inevitably be the cause of the recent future war. Looking around at the tense situation in the civil society and the dire situation in the country, I have three thoughts on the day of commemorating Mr. Liao. First, Mr. Liao had a deep understanding of the Prime Minister's doctrine. This can be seen from Mr. Liao's writings, such as National Politics. And Mr. Liao's book "National Politics" at that time, when thoughts were complex and discussions were mixed, could prove Mr. Liao's loyalty to Sun Yat-sen's doctrine. Later, Mr. Dai Chuanxian, Zhou Fohai, Chen Lifu, and other gentlemen all had special works to expound the Prime Minister's doctrine, which had special effects in various periods. Second, Mr. Liao helped the Prime Minister reorganize the Kuomintang of China in the Republic of China year 12, and helped Mr. Chiang Kai-shek prepare for the organization of the National Revolutionary Army in year 13, all of which made great achievements and should not be forgotten by us. When we recall the past strictness of the party in organization, it is not uncommon to get it from Mr. Liao's efforts. Third, Mr. Liao had a plan to unify finance and military affairs because he regretted the various separatist situations in the country during his lifetime. Although it was obstructed by warlords such as Yang Liu and failed to materialize at that time, we can see from today's domestic situation that the unification of military affairs and finance is more urgent than in the past. If we do not seek self-help when the imperialists are now plotting against each other and invading weak nations, the country will perish without a day. And the way to self-help is to unify first, so I deeply hope that all local authorities in the country should unify all military and financial affairs under the control of the central government, otherwise destroying unity is an unforgivable crime, and everyone can punish them. The slogans of the general meeting were: (1) Mr. Liao Zhongkai's spirit is immortal, (2) Mr. Liao Zhongkai is a loyal follower of the Prime Minister, (3) Learn from Mr. Liao's revolutionary spirit, (4) Commemorate Mr. Liao, to eliminate the Red bandits and relieve the suffering of farmers and workers, (5) Develop production and enrich national power, (6) Long live the Three Principles of the People, (7) Long live the Kuomintang of China. This year, all places.</p>
<h3>Prediction of a Bumper Cotton Harvest</h3>
<p>Production to Increase by 40% Compared to Previous Years. American Cotton Launch to Be Affected. This year, the National Economic Committee's Cotton Industry Control Association distributed cotton seeds, and cotton planting in various regions has been more extensive than in previous years. According to the cotton industry's predictions, as the new cotton is about to enter the market, this year's harvest may increase by 40% compared to last year. The information obtained is recorded below:</p>
<p>Regional Conditions: Although there was a severe drought this summer, cotton requires little water, so cotton planting in various regions was not significantly affected. According to the Cotton Control Association's investigation, the cotton-planting areas in Jiangsu, Henan, Jiangxi, and Hebei provinces are all in good condition. The annual yield in various parts of Zhejiang is very low. Although this year's situation is slightly inferior to previous years, it does not affect the total output. As for the harvest time, the early harvests can begin in the middle of next month, and the later harvests can be picked at the end of next month or the beginning of October. The timing of the harvest depends on the soil and water conditions in various regions.</p>
<p>Doubled Production: According to the cotton industry, the weather has been quite suitable for the cotton planted this year, so it has not suffered any losses. Moreover, there has not been much heavy rain, so the cotton seedlings were not blown down when they blossomed, resulting in firm and fine fibers, which are quite suitable for spinning second-class fine yarn. Among them, the American cotton variety is the best, which will reduce the import of Indian cotton in the future. Ten years ago, the national cotton production was about 20 million dan (a unit of weight), but in recent years, due to rural decline and merchant monopolies, farmers have had little interest in cotton planting. At the same time, due to lack of improvement, the output has decreased day by day. The estimates for the past two years are about 8 million dan for the national output in 1932 and about 8.5 million dan in 1933, a decrease of 60% compared to before. This year, thanks to the Cotton Control Association's efforts to improve the situation and distribute American cotton seeds, the output has increased accordingly. According to general predictions, Shaanxi Province alone can double its harvest. The total national output this year is expected to be over 11 million dan, which is 40% more than last year.</p>
<p>Impact of American Cotton: In addition to using domestic cotton, Chinese yarn factories also need to purchase Indian and American cotton to spin fine yarn, because domestic cotton is not suitable for spinning fine yarn. Indian cotton is required for yarns around 30 count, and American cotton is required for yarns above 30 count and above 50 count. This year's cotton harvest is expected to increase, with fine and thick fibers, so the cotton yarn industry expects that the import of Indian cotton can be reduced this year. It is also learned that the wheat flour from the cotton and wheat loan from the United States has been purchased by flour manufacturers, but the yarn industry has no intention of buying the American cotton. If this American cotton enters the market, the new cotton will inevitably be affected. A Wartime Rumor from the Russo-Japanese War.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Side Deliberately Shows Calm</h3>
<p>Saying it's Not as Bad as the Telegrams Report. According to the Central News Agency, since the September 18th Incident when the Japanese army forcibly occupied Northeast China, due to conflicts of interest, the situation between Japan and the Soviet Union has become increasingly tense. The issue of selling the Chinese Eastern Railway has implicitly become the key to the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union. Now that the negotiations have broken down, the situation between the two countries is becoming more and more dangerous. According to telegrams yesterday morning, Soviet women in the Harbin area have been summoned by their government to retreat back to their country along the Harbin-Manchuria line of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Young men of military age have also been ordered to report to Chita and Khabarovsk. The military deployments and military demonstrations on both sides of the Russian border have made the people of Harbin panic, and war rumors are rampant. Yesterday morning, the reporter inquired about this at the information office of the Japanese Consulate General in this city. According to the representative of the office, the dangerous situation between Japan and the Soviet Union on the Russian border is indeed true, but the degree of danger seems not as bad as the telegrams report. The representative continued, saying that the negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union on the Chinese Eastern Railway have not reached a stage of complete breakdown. The Russian side announced the negotiation process before the end of the negotiations, so the Japanese side expressed deep dissatisfaction. However, according to another source, the delegation of the puppet organization attending the Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations left Tokyo, and at the same time, the puppet organization issued a statement intending to blame the Soviet Union for the termination of the negotiations. It is widely believed that the Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations have broken down.</p>
<h3>Important Japanese Figures to Come to China for Investigation</h3>
<p>In the past year or two, many Japanese officials and civilians have come to various parts of China for investigation. According to the Japanese Consulate General in this city, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, and the Ambassador to France, Sato, etc., are scheduled to depart from Japan within this month to come to China for investigation. Their itinerary seems to be to first go to the three northeastern provinces, and then go to Shanghai via Tianjin and Beijing. If there is enough time, they will go to the Yangtze River area and various parts of South China.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Embassy to Add a Counselor</h3>
<p>Regarding the widely rumored issue of the Japanese Minister to China being promoted, the Japanese Consulate General believes it is just a rumor. The issue of exchanging ambassadors between China and Japan has been widely rumored several times in the past two or three years, but it has not been realized. Neither the Chinese nor the Japanese government has made any statement on this issue, and it is feared that it will be difficult to realize for a while. However, it is learned that the Japanese Embassy in China will restore a counselor's post. The counselor's authority is greater than that of a secretary. The Embassy had this post three years ago, but it was vacated due to resignation and was not filled. Therefore, it is now planned to restore it.</p>
<h3>Xu Xueyu Prepares Nanchang Telephone</h3>
<p>The Project is Completed and Telephone Service Begins. The Ministry of Transportation believes that the Nanchang Commercial Telephone Company is poorly managed and urgently needs rectification. Therefore, in April, it specially appointed Xu Xueyu, Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, to concurrently serve as the Director of the Nanchang Telephone Preparatory Office, with a deadline for completion by the end of August this year. According to the person in charge of the Telephone Bureau, Director Xu arrived in Jiangxi on May 3, established the Preparatory Office on the 4th, and immediately began surveying lines, purchasing poles and materials, and designing and planning. Construction began on May 18 and proceeded actively. The entire telephone service began last night. It is said that the construction took more than 90 days. At first, there was continuous rain, followed by severe drought and steaming heat. The oppressive heat of Xunzhou, coupled with the delayed delivery of wooden poles and delayed transportation, caused various unexpected difficulties in the project. Otherwise, the telephone service could have been started earlier. Director Xu will go to Beijing to attend the National Telecommunications Conference immediately after the preparatory work is completed.</p>
<h3>Ten Disabled Soldiers from the Songhu War of Resistance Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dissolves the Sanatorium, Appealing to All Sectors to Uphold Justice. During the January 28th Songhu War of Resistance, the disabled soldiers injured in battle were cared for by all sectors, who raised funds to establish the Songhu War of Resistance Disabled Veterans Sanatorium in Guangzhou. Last April, 500 people went from Shanghai. The Guangdong authorities have now dissolved the sanatorium to save money, and the disabled soldiers in the sanatorium have been discharged in three batches. Now, ten disabled officers, including Zhang Yuejiu, Pan Huang, Xia Mingqiang, Cui Lutang, Lu Xin, Tang Jieyu, Zhou Kezhong, Cai Shijian, Tang Xian, and Li Sheng, have been abandoned in Shanghai, with no means of making a living, and appeal to all sectors to uphold justice.</p>
<h3>Dates for Registration of Private Car Drivers</h3>
<p>The Public Concession's Bureau of Public Works will conduct registration of private rickshaw (chartered car) drivers in the concession starting next month, from September 1st to September 8th. The first batch of over 2,000 people will be processed in two locations: one is the Hongkou Office, located at the corner of Wusong Road and Bazilu; the other is the Xinzha Office, located in the Bureau of Public Works warehouse on Makien Road. The registration order is based on the numbers on the blank petition forms issued previously. Each day is divided into four shifts: (1) starting at 7:00 AM, (2) starting at 10:00 AM, (3) starting at 3:00 PM, (4) starting at 5:00 PM. All car owners should instruct their drivers to write the petition forms clearly and bring the registration fee of one yuan to the designated location at the appointed time.

<p>Rivers Are Dried Up, Goods Are Scarce.</p>
<h3>The Price of Lime Soars Yesterday</h3>
<p>All Units Changed to 30 Yuan. The Construction Industry Expresses Panic. Lime is one of the building materials, and the demand in Shanghai is huge. Recently, due to the drought and lack of rain, the rivers are cut off, and the supply to Shanghai is scarce, resulting in a sharp increase in prices. The construction industry is very concerned about this. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Scarcity of Goods: It is reported that most of the lime used in Shanghai comes from Yixing and Liyang. The area is surrounded by mountains and rich in limestone. Manual excavation is used first, followed by burning the lime in earthen kilns, and then transporting the entire batch to Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places for sale. The price has always been lower than that of cement, so the construction industry likes to purchase it. Now, due to the dry rivers in the area, transportation is hindered, and the supply is very scarce. Although the Xiyi Highway can be relied on for transportation, the freight is quite high, which merchants cannot afford.</p>
<p>Price Increase Yesterday: The lime industry in Shanghai believes that the supply of lime has been cut off in recent days, while the demand in the construction industry is very strong, creating a trend of supply falling short of demand. The total inventory in Shanghai is less than 500 dan. If this continues, it will greatly hinder the future of construction. Therefore, it is planned to transport it by land, but because the freight is higher, in order to avoid losses, it was decided to increase the price yesterday. Each unit is sold for 30 yuan, with no discount. It is planned to continue to increase the price in the future depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Hindrance to Construction: According to people in the construction industry, lime, also known as paper tendon lime, is an important raw material for construction. Both Chinese and Western-style houses need to use it. Recently, because the rivers in the producing area are impassable, water transportation is difficult, and the supply is scarce, the lime industry has suddenly increased the selling price. Although there is nothing wrong with it in terms of economic principles, it is extremely harmful to the construction industry, especially for contracting businesses. Because the price of lime was low when contracting, the contract price was also cheap. Now the price of lime has risen sharply, resulting in not a small loss.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhijian to Leave the Country Today to Attend the American Leprosy Conference</h3>
<p>Accompanying Him to Investigate Leprosy Affairs in Various Places. According to the Guowen News Agency, Mr. Wu Zhijian, Director General of the China Leprosy Relief Association, has been invited to attend the annual meeting of the American Leprosy Relief Association to be held in New York in October this year. The second board of directors of the association has approved this invitation. At the same time, the Nanjing Health Department has also taken advantage of Mr. Wu's trip abroad to appoint him as a special commissioner to investigate leprosy issues in Japan, South America, Hawaii, and other places, in order to learn from their experiences for leprosy relief in China. Mr. Wu has completed preparations and is scheduled to board the President Grant at the New Customs Wharf at 2:00 PM today. This morning, he told reporters that the Chinese people are not very concerned about the occurrence of this problem, so he plans to give lectures on leprosy and relief in major cities in South America after the conference closes, in order to arouse the sympathy and assistance of people in those countries for China, so that we can devote all our efforts to relief and prevent it from spreading and causing harm.</p>

<h3>South District</h3>
<h3>Rent Reduction Association Sends Letter to Sun Chuanfang</h3>
<p>Regarding the Request for Rent Reduction in Xicheng Lane, French Concession. The Shanghai Nanshi District Rent Reduction Committee, in response to the request for rent reduction in Xicheng Lane, yesterday passed a motion proposed by Shen Xinfu, a standing committee member of the association, and instructed Secretary Wu Jingtang to draft a fast mail telegram. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Revered Retired Scholar, Since you retired from military life, the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have missed your past achievements. Today, the people of Shanghai who live in Xicheng Lane still see your former residence, which serves as a place to reflect on the past. Although you are isolated from the world, you must be able to find peace of mind in Zen Buddhism. The people of your second hometown admire you so much. Recently, the tenants of Xicheng Lane, a property in the French Concession, have sent a letter requesting that the houses they live in, located in Xicheng Lane, Ximen Road, Malong Road, French Concession, a total of 124 households, belonging to Mr. Sun Chuanfang, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Five Provinces Allied Forces, and home to more than 2,000 residents, have been rented for more than ten years. Now, at a time when the commercial market is declining and all industries are bankrupt, rent reductions have been implemented everywhere. The residents have organized the Xicheng Lane Branch of the Shanghai Second Special Zone Citizens' Federation and unanimously requested a rent reduction of 10% to restore the rent to the level before 1930. They have submitted a petition to your association, requesting your fair assistance and earnestly requesting that the details be telegraphed to Sun Chuanfang, urging him to approve the rent reduction and withdraw his lawsuit from the court. We feel obliged to forward this to you. Based on this, we immediately convened a meeting of the committee members to discuss the matter. It was generally agreed that since the houses in Xicheng Lane are Mr. Sun's property, it is well known that Mr. Sun has retired in Tianjin and devoted himself to Zen meditation, so he would not be so concerned about such things. It must be the agents who are deceiving him. Therefore, we are sending this letter to you to inform you of the situation, and we ask you to investigate the matter in detail and clarify the truth, so that your wisdom can shine brightly and expose the deception, so as not to be blinded by the masses. Our association has thought about this again and again, and we know that you are isolated from the world and deeply immersed in Zen studies. You cannot practice universal love and benevolence to relieve all suffering. You learn righteous knowledge and understanding every day, and you can see everything clearly. You have the sword of wisdom to subdue the bodies of others, so that their minds are not allowed to be wanton. You practice stillness, enter meditation, cultivate your mind, and follow the path. You do good and return to truth. You remove the thorns from the road and remove the stubborn stones from the road. All false names and false profits are accepted. Accept the pure and wonderful Tao, so that no dust can stand. This is the origin of all things for you. Therefore, the members of our association know that you will never be blinded by appearances. However, the agents do not have the same heart as the owner and have only brewed the false rumor of Zeng Shen killing someone. Why is this? Why not compare them to Feng Huan, the retainer of Lord Mengchang? They have failed to live up to the owner's elegant demeanor. We believe that you have retreated to the garden and regard wealth and glory as fleeting clouds. You have established compassion and morality as your main purpose. Just like last year, when the Yellow River breached its banks and caused a disaster in western Shandong, you were able to appeal on behalf of the disaster victims and advocate for disaster relief. Thinking of the virtuous people of your second hometown, you formed a good relationship with them. Even in the face of such great disasters and destitution, you were not afraid of difficulties and hardships and upheld the compassionate heart of doing what is right. Now, for the residents of Xicheng Lane, who are in a state of declining industries and sitting in a precarious city, you will never be greedy for profit and help to create a chaotic scene in Shanghai. Moreover, since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, everyone knows that the city has suffered a terrible calamity unprecedented in history. To this day, the city's vitality has not recovered, and merchants and residents are barely surviving. The whole city is full of devastation. Anyone with a human heart will try to remedy the situation. We are concerned about our hometown and dare not forget the suffering of our people. We believe that you, with your Buddhist heart and compassionate heart, will show sympathy and enable the citizens to live and work in peace and restore the prosperity of Shanghai. If you can provide universal salvation, just like the thick earth and high heavens, then the people of Shanghai will remember you with gratitude, just like the people of Xian Mountain remember those who helped them. Our association has no choice but to write this letter to speak on behalf of the citizens and respectfully await your guidance to resolve this matter and satisfy the hopes of the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.</p>

<h3>Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory</h3>
<h3>Relieving the Silk Industry</h3>
<p>Organizing a Yangtze River Exhibition Tour for Promotion. The Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory feels that the domestic silk industry has been declining in recent years, and the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers and farmers who depend on silk are precarious. It will be difficult to revive the industry without promotion. Therefore, this year, it organized the Yangtze River Domestic Silk Exhibition Tour to visit the five major ports of Wuhu, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Hankou, and Changsha. Hundreds of kinds of the latest Mei Ya products will be displayed and exhibited. In each of these ports, the products will be entrusted to local silk shops for sale at low prices, and high-quality domestic goods will be given away as gifts to promote domestic silk. The tour is led by Mr. Gao Shiheng, Deputy Manager of the factory, and consists of more than 20 members. They departed last night on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangshun.</p>

<h3>The Taiyi Factory Tragedy Reported Yesterday</h3>
<p>Two Children and an Elderly Person Were Just Passing By and Were Affected. The Corpses Were Examined and Coffined by the Court Yesterday. The Families of the Victims Have Begun to Register. Residents of Hengqing Lane Request That the Other Factory Be Ordered to Relocate.</p>
<p>The Taiyi Malt Extract Factory in Hengqing Lane, Beile Road, French Concession, collapsed entirely in the morning before yesterday due to a cylinder explosion and fire, crushing and injuring 26 employees, apprentices, male and female workers, etc. (Ms. Huang, the wife of factory owner Zhang Jingchu, who lived in the factory, was also burned.) Five male and female pedestrians were crushed to death. Factory owner Zhang Jingchu also died in the disaster while repairing the engine and being unable to escape. The details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Here are additional details that were not published in yesterday's newspaper, as well as the autopsy and other information.</p>
<p>It is reported that the factory owner, Zhang Jingchu, was 47 years old this year and was from Linhai County, Zhejiang Province. He was originally an engineer in a soap factory. After careful management, he accumulated more than 10,000 yuan and then changed his career. In 1929, he invested 10,000 yuan to rent land and build a house on Haichang Branch Road, Zhabei, to establish the Taiyi Malt Extract Factory, specializing in the production of monosodium glutamate (MSG) for seasoning, which was sold on the market. Initially,</p>
<h3>Scope Was Very Small</h3>
<p>Gradually, due to the development of the business, the original capital was not sufficient to promote and expand. Therefore, two years ago, it was reorganized into a partnership company, raising 12 shares of external capital. Zhang and his wife obtained 8 shares (two shares of the wife were issued under the name of another person), Wang Zhengyu obtained 2 shares, and another Zhang (who worked in a soap factory) obtained 2 shares. Each share was capitalized at 2,500 yuan, making a total of 20,000 yuan. Later, a second factory and distribution office was established in Hengqing Lane, Beile Road, French Concession. Zhang himself served as the factory director, manager, and engineer. Wang Zhengyu, a shareholder, was elected as the director of the business department and the promotion shares for domestic and foreign ports. Liu Xitang from Ningbo was hired as the accountant and cashier. Since the business began, only official interest has been paid to the shareholders. Dividends and profits have never been distributed. This money was used to add assets and gradually expand the scope, resulting in</p>
<h3>Today's Achievements</h3>
<p>Fire insurance of 17,000 yuan was purchased from the Huaxing Insurance Company, fire insurance of 7,000 yuan was purchased from the Ningshao Insurance Company, and insurance of 4,000 yuan was purchased for Zhang's personal furniture, clothing, and luggage of the employees living in the factory, totaling 38,000 yuan in fire insurance. Unexpectedly, in the morning before yesterday, the engine was damaged and the craftsmen mistakenly smashed the gas pipe, causing a fire and exploding the cylinder, resulting in a catastrophic disaster. In addition to the crushing, burning, and Zhang Jingchu's death, and the crushing death of pedestrians Jing Yilin and the maid Ji Jinmao who were passing by, who were identified by their families, as reported in yesterday's newspaper, one of the boy's body was mistakenly identified as Zhang Jiangyao, an apprentice from Ningbo in the factory. In fact, he was Mo Zhangfu from Nanxun, 17 years old, who lived at No. 20 Hengqing Lane and was a silk weaving apprentice in a silk factory in Nanshi. He was going to the silk factory for work when he was caught in the disaster while passing by the area.</p>
<h3>Another Child Corpse</h3>
<p>Zhao Mujin, a fifteen-year-old apprentice at the No. 862 large pancake shop on Beile Road, was crushed to death while shopping. Another unidentified male corpse, an elderly man named Jiang Jiaxian from She County, Anhui Province, was fifty-seven years old. He was a doctor living at No. 21 Zhenming Lane, Weiwo Road, Huajie, Xieqiao, and died in the Hengqing Lane while making a house call. The above three corpses were only identified by their masters and families that night. Yesterday morning, the police station sent detectives to notify the families: Zhang Hongjiu (the seven-year-old tenth son of Zhang Jingchu), Chen (wife of Jing Yilin), Ji Amao (niece-in-law of Ji Jinmao), Jiang Zhao (wife of Jiang Jiaxian), Xu Shunquan (master of Mo Zhangfu), and Shi Amao (master of Zhao Mujin), a total of six people, were brought in for questioning. The case was reported to the Second Special District Local Court Prosecutor's Office, which dispatched Chief Prosecutor Wei Ligong, clerk Zhao Yifen, and others to inspect the morgue at noon.</p>
<h3>Examination of the Corpses</h3>
<p>After taking their seats, Detective Zhang Chunsheng first reported the investigation's progress after the incident. The officials then questioned each of the family members. They then announced that Zhang Jingchu had indeed died from burns sustained before death, and that Jing Yilin, Ji Jinmao, Mo Zhangfu, Zhao Mujin, and Jiang Jiaxian had indeed died from injuries sustained before death. The corpses were handed over to their respective families for burial after signing a guarantee. It is also reported that the families of the victims have set up a registration office for the families of the victims of the Taiyi Wheat Essence Factory disaster at No. 21 Hengqing Lane, which began registering yesterday morning. On the other hand, they have commissioned lawyer Gu Jirong to negotiate with the factory on their behalf, demanding compensation and condolences. There are currently four other factories in Hengqing Lane, including two sock factories, one silk weaving factory, and one wool factory, all of which have motors and engines installed inside the lane. Residents, mindful of the tragic precedent set by the Taiyi factory, have jointly petitioned the French Municipal Council and the French Police Department, requesting that these four factories be ordered to relocate in order to ensure safety in the future.

<h3>Request for Severe Punishment of the Farmers' Association</h3>
<p>Illegally Levying Donations and Using False Names for Private Gain Arrest of Zhang Huichun and Four Others Xin Xin She reported that the 204 manure cart owners in the Shanghai Southern District have been subjected to annual donations of over 800 yuan by the Farmers' Association for the past seven years, without any public accounting of these funds. They previously petitioned the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, requesting a thorough investigation of the association's public funds. The Bureau of Social Affairs expressed full acceptance, which greatly satisfied the cart owners. It has now been discovered that the Farmers' Association secretly convened a meeting on the 19th to discuss ways to deceive the cart owners. They immediately submitted a document to the Political Training Department of the Central Gendarmerie Regiment of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, which dispatched troops to the Farmers' Association, arresting the ringleader Zhang Huichun and four others, and seizing various pieces of evidence. They were then handed over to the department for interrogation. The association also convened an emergency meeting yesterday, convened by Geng Huizhen and others. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Petition for Relief</h3>
<p>A petition from manure cart representatives Geng Huizhen and others to the Political Training Department of the Central Gendarmerie Regiment of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for assistance, the original text is as follows: For the purpose of controlling business, seizing power and exploiting, using the party for private gain, and oppressing the people, we jointly request assistance. The petitioners (1,028 local Shanghai residents and 102 non-local residents) all make a living in the southern part of Shanghai by pulling carts and dumping manure. In 1927, the opposing parties, under the guise of party members, established a Farmers' Association, enticing the petitioners to join. All the manure car donation certificates of the manure workers were urged to be contracted to them, with each manure cart paying three yuan, plus four yuan for the two seasons of donations each year. However, the Municipal Bureau of Finance only charges two yuan and nineteen cents per cart per month. The opposing parties falsely claimed that the surplus funds were used for the Farmers' Association's expenses. It is estimated that the monthly surplus is 233 yuan and 23 cents. From 1927 to today, the total surplus is over 16,000 yuan. However, the association only has two opposing parties, one inspector, and one tea servant, so the expenses are extremely minimal, which is quite obvious. We do not know what these people are using the money for, and the accounts have never been made public. This is the first matter that urgently needs to be requested for assistance. In addition, the opposing parties, after claiming to handle the donation and license issuance, take the soft paper license issued by the Municipal Bureau of Finance as their own and never hand it over to the petitioners for safekeeping (because without the soft license, they cannot pay the donation and obtain the hard iron license). After several negotiations, the Public Security Bureau ordered them to hand it over, but they still disobey. This is the second matter that urgently needs to be requested for assistance. Since the petitioners were induced to join the association, it is as if they have entered a prison, subject to being slaughtered. In June of this year, the opposing parties ordered the petitioners to add two yuan per cart per month. When they argued with them, they were accused of resisting the donation and were not issued cart licenses. Also, if a new cart is added, the Municipal Bureau of Finance and the Public Works Bureau issue a white porcelain plate and charge seven yuan and two cents, while the opposing parties demand 25 to 35 yuan per plate. Also, if a manure worker is old or the cart owner changes, the opposing parties charge five yuan per person. The petitioners have repeatedly argued with them, but they always shirk their responsibility to the party headquarters to make things difficult. Therefore, they once filed a lawsuit with the Public Security Bureau, but they stubbornly denied it. The petitioners begged to withdraw from the association, and the bureau ordered them to do so, and they agreed. However, they still refused to comply. This is the third matter that urgently needs to be requested for assistance. Today, the opposing parties even dare to hold meetings to suppress the manure workers, who dare not resist. If this continues, hundreds of manure workers will be slaughtered, and their livelihoods will be cut off, leading to a major disaster. Therefore, they have no choice but to jointly request an investigation, arrest the opposing parties, and grant the following requests: (1) The opposing parties should make public the accounts from 1927 to the present, in order to be fair and just. (2) Order the opposing parties to return the soft paper licenses of the petitioners' manure carts, so that they can choose to go to the Bureau of Finance to pay the donation and obtain the hard iron licenses. (3) Prohibit the opposing parties from using the party for private gain, allow the 204 petitioners to withdraw from the Farmers' Association, and restore our freedom. We will be forever grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Political Training Department of the Central Gendarmerie Regiment. Petitioners: Geng Lingzhen, Zhao Wenfu, Li Guangtian, etc.</p>
<h3>Arrest and Severe Punishment</h3>
<p>After receiving the petition, the Political Training Department of the Central Gendarmerie Regiment of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters considered that the association's use of the party for private gain was extremely illegal. On the 19th, it dispatched officer Dongfang Bai to lead several gendarmes to the Jiangjing Temple meeting place in Xiaomuqiao, New West District. The association was holding a secret meeting, and Zhang Huichun, Zhang Huijun, Pan Rongting, Lu Shikui, and other four people were arrested on the spot. Many kinds of illegal evidence were found. The above four people are still detained in the headquarters and will be severely punished according to law to serve as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Cart Owners' Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Southern District Farmers' Manure Cart has a total of 204 carts. Cart owner representatives held a tea party meeting at a certain teahouse in Xieqiao at 2 pm yesterday. Zhao Wenfu, Chuan Changbao, Geng Huizhen, Lu Yuqiao, Li Guangtian, Zhu Chengyao, Liu Changbai, Cai Zuxiu, Song Chengye, Xia Jinshan, Wang Zaitian, Tang Xuyou, and other 200 people attended. Geng Huizhen was elected as the chairman, and Sun Ding was the recorder. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and then the following resolutions were passed: (1) Request the government to require the association to make public the public funds for seven years. (2) Request the government to allow the reorganization of the association to provide effective protection for the cart owners. (3) The soft paper license should be returned to the cart owners. (4) Freedom to obtain licenses and operate the business was discussed. The meeting adjourned at about 4 pm. Gasoline Price</p>
<h3>Continued to Rise Yesterday</h3>
<p>The four major kerosene companies, Asiatic Petroleum, Mobil, Texaco, and Oil Field, previously reduced kerosene prices for promotional purposes, resulting in exhaustion and huge losses. The companies agreed to raise prices to recover previous losses, as this competition hindered business. Gasoline prices, in addition to the three previous price increases, rose across the board yesterday. The details are as follows: Consistent Price Increases It is reported that the four major kerosene companies, including Asiatic Petroleum, have consistently increased the prices of kerosene and gasoline since agreeing to stop the competition. Kerosene prices have already risen to a considerable level, while gasoline prices have not yet risen above cost to cater to the psychology of buyers. Although the selling price has risen from seven yuan per ten gallons to eight yuan and six jiao in the last three months, the kerosene companies still feel that the cost is too high. Therefore, they agreed to raise prices by half a yuan across the board yesterday. The current selling price is now nine yuan and one jiao per ten gallons. Continued Increases A person in the kerosene industry told a Dagongshe reporter yesterday that gasoline prices had suddenly fallen from twelve yuan per ten gallons to five yuan during the kerosene companies' promotional period last year. Since the establishment of the agreed distribution method, prices have gradually increased. Although the price has now risen to nine yuan and one jiao, it is still not enough to cover costs. According to its original price, it is impossible to make a profit unless it rises to twelve yuan. There is a definite trend of increasing prices every month thereafter. Affects People's Livelihood The people in the interior of our country originally used vegetable oil for lighting, and the raw materials were purely produced in our country. Although the firepower is small and dim, the selling price is extremely cheap, which is very suitable for the needs of ordinary people. Since foreign merchants opened commercial ports and tried to sell kerosene and gasoline to China, kerosene immediately defeated vegetable oil and penetrated the people's use. Although gasoline is only needed by wealthy families in cities, the impact is still fresh. However, the price of long-distance buses in the interior will inevitably increase sharply due to the increase in oil prices, which will affect the livelihood of ordinary people. It is not a small matter. Professor of Lingnan University</p>
<h3>Walked More Than 10,000 Miles</h3>
<p>Passed Through More Than Ten Provinces Experienced Countless Hardships Wang Xilin, a professor at Lingnan University in Guangdong, set off from Guangdong two months ago to conduct a walking inspection of the political, economic, and customs conditions in various parts of the country. He traveled through twelve provinces in border areas, covering 13,000 miles in 71 days. A Shenshi She reporter learned yesterday that Wang had arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou. Wang was picked up on June 7 after departing from Guangzhou, carrying extremely simple luggage, only carrying 22 yuan of Guangdong silver and a bicycle. In these two months, he traveled through more than 50 important cities in China, passing through more than ten provinces, including Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Shandong, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hebei, Chahar, Mongolia, Shanxi, and Henan. Wang lived an extremely simple life similar to that of a wild man on the road, and encountered difficulties in Sichuan and other places. All his luggage was lost, but he was spared. However, Wang continued to move forward and finally returned to Shanghai yesterday. In total, he traveled more than 13,000 miles. It is said that Wang will stay in Shanghai for about three to four days and then take a boat back to the south to complete his planned plan. What is in the Jiagunjun Guild Hall</p>
<h3>Rotting Male Corpse Hanging</h3>
<p>The corpse was hanging outside the railing, holding the railing with both hands. At about 5 pm the day before yesterday, Wang Sijing, the director of the Taiyang Temple police station of the Zhabei Fourth District Public Security Bureau, reported that at about 4 pm today (that is, the day before yesterday), Yu A, a tea house employee of the guild hall, went upstairs to get something. When he arrived at the escalator, he suddenly saw a person hanging on the escalator railing. He reported that he had committed suicide by hanging himself, so he came to report and requested the police to go and investigate. The inspector immediately sent police chief Zhu Liming to investigate and found that the deceased was about twenty years old, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and trousers. He used his trouser belt to hang himself on the escalator railing. The corpse was hanging outside the railing, holding the railing with both hands. The corpse had rotted and there was blood dripping down, indicating that he had been dead for many days. It was then learned that the deceased had climbed in from the bamboo fence outside the wall, climbed the stairs through the broken wall pillar, passed through the broken house, and hanged himself on the escalator railing. Since there was no family, he immediately returned to the police station to report to the Fourth District, and ordered Lu Abao, the local security guard of the Eleventh Ward, to report to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy yesterday morning. At about 3 pm, Prosecutor Xiao Jinying was dispatched, along with Secretary Zhang Guowei and others, to the scene to examine the unidentified male corpse. It was determined that he had committed suicide by hanging himself before death. The corpse was filled out and the local security guard was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial. A white cloth short shirt, a cloth jacket, and a pair of galoshes were found beside the corpse and kept on file. Gong Xikui, the chief of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, took photos of the corpse for record in order to facilitate the family of the deceased to come and claim it.</p>
<h3>Three Suicides</h3>
<p>Two people due to economic difficulties, one person suffering from mental illness Shen Liansheng, a 22-year-old from Huzhou, was recently unemployed and struggling to make a living in Shanghai. Due to this, he had extreme financial difficulties. The day before yesterday, after much thought, he had the idea of ending his life. He went to the Kaitai Hotel at No. 293 Tianjin Road alone. After borrowing room No. 85, he secretly swallowed Lysol disinfectant to commit suicide. When the hotel tea servant discovered it, he was moaning on the bed. He was immediately taken to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died soon after. The hospital reported to the Lao Zha police station, and ordered detectives to investigate. A suicide note was found beside the deceased, addressed to the manager of the hotel, saying that he was very sorry for committing suicide, which was due to his dissatisfaction. He asked him to tell Shen Yiren, the general affairs section of the Huashang Securities Exchange on Sanmalu Road, and asked him to come and claim the corpse out of fellow countrymen's friendship. Also, Tang Jingxi, a 23-year-old from Ningbo, had been unemployed for a long time and had extreme financial difficulties. A few days ago, he borrowed the name Han Xinrong at No. 227 Hubei Road and booked room No. 208. He suddenly had the idea of ending his life and secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. When the tea servant discovered it, it was too late. He was immediately taken to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died soon after. The hospital reported to the Lao Zha police station, and ordered detectives to investigate. A suicide note was found beside the deceased, addressed to his father-in-law Fu Liansheng at No. 204 Zhoujiapailu Road, saying that he had committed suicide in a hotel because he could not make a living, and begged him to come and claim the corpse. Also, Jiang Afu, a young man from Yong, living at No. 23 Tongle Lane, Xinjibang Road, had been suffering from mental disorder. The day before yesterday, his father Jiang Xiasheng and others went to a relative's house for dinner, leaving only Jiang at home. His old illness relapsed, and he suddenly had the idea of ending his life and committed suicide by hanging himself. When his father and others returned and discovered it, they quickly tried to untie him, but it was too late. He immediately reported to the Jiaxing Road police station and ordered detectives to investigate. His corpse was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died soon after. The above three corpses were all carried by the police stations to the Feilun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court was requested to dispatch Prosecutor Guo Wei to the morgue to examine the corpses one by one, which was verified to be true. He then instructed the families to sign separate guarantees and take the coffins back for burial. Special Commissioner for Chemical Industry Investigation</p>
<h3>Liang Mengqi Passes Through Shanghai to the United States</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial Government recently sent Special Commissioner Liang Mengqi to the United States to investigate the chemical industry in various places. Liang took the maiden voyage of the President Grant on the 18th and passed through Shanghai at 6 pm on the 20th yesterday. Liang graduated from Lingnan University and taught chemistry at Zhongda Xiangqin University in Guangzhou for several years, gaining a great deal of experience. A few years ago, he founded the Zhonghua Paint Company and the Dashenghang Paint and Coating Company in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, serving as a technician and chairman. The products are very good. On this trip to Shanghai, the reporter made a special trip to visit him. According to him, China urgently needs to engage in production and construction in the future, so he gladly accepted the appointment to inspect. He decided to go to Shirley, then to San Francisco, paying special attention to the major factories in the eastern part of North America. He may also enter the factory for practical training, striving to understand the truth of the local industry and contribute to the country. He expects to return to China in one year. Alege Road</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on an Agency Manufacturing Red Pills</h3>
<p>More than 10,000 Red Pills Seized On the Spot Li Fusheng Arrested The French Concession Police Department is very strict on all gambling and contraband items. At 5:15 pm yesterday morning, Inspector General Jin Jiulin learned that a highly addictive drug was being manufactured at No. 26 Allege Road. He ordered Detective Zhang Ziying, Deputy Detective Wang Yonggui, Qin Youyu, and Detective Ma Yizhi to search the address, seizing 17,000 red pills and a large number of manufacturing machines, and arresting Li Fusheng (also known as Xiaofusheng). He confessed to manufacturing and selling the drug. After hearing the confession, Inspector General Jin ordered the detectives to strictly apprehend the accomplices and bring them to court for interrogation. After the death of Sichuan merchant Cheng Zhong'an</p>
<h3>Two Wives Were Discovered</h3>
<p>Each Accused the Other in Court Who is the Legal Wife, Does the Deceased Know Sichuan native Cheng Zhong'an used to do business in Beiping, Tianjin, and other places, accumulating thousands of taels of gold. In February of this year, Cheng Zhong'an went to Beiping with his nephew Fan Weisheng to do business. Before a month had passed, Cheng died of illness in Beiping. Now, two women, Cheng Li (also known as Li Abao) and Cheng Jiang (also known as Jiang Yueying), each hired lawyers to sue each other in the local court over the inheritance issue. They both claimed to be Cheng Zhong'an's wife and attacked the other as a concubine. The situation was quite interesting. The requests of both parties to confirm their identities are detailed below. Cheng Li hired lawyer Liu Xiang to file a petition with the court for mediation, accusing the opposing party, Jiang Yueying, of being the deceased husband Cheng Zhong'an's concubine, so she requested confirmation of her identity. Later, because the mediation failed, she formally filed a lawsuit. Cheng Li's complaint stated that she married the deceased husband Cheng Zhong'an as a successor wife in April of 1923, through matchmakers Chen Shixin and Zhang Laotai. The following year, she gave birth to a daughter named Ruiying, who is now eleven years old. Last year, with the consent of her late husband, she adopted a son named Yaozu, who is now two years old. While her late husband was alive, he always did business in other places. All household affairs, such as well and mortar, silver money in and out, and withdrawing large sums from the bank, were handled by her alone. Her husband liked to fish for women and frequented brothels, which he considered a habit. He was addicted to opium and often smoked it in the brothel, although she tried to dissuade him, it rarely worked. Last August, she found out that he did not return home all night, and she knew something was wrong. She urgently inquired everywhere and learned that he had been arrested and detained by the police station for smoking opium. When she went to visit him, she found that there was a middle-aged woman with her husband, who was very intimate with him. She then questioned him after his release and learned that the woman's name was Jiang Yueying. Because her husband died and she was poor, she had to go out to make a living. After they met in the opium den, the woman used seductive methods and became a concubine. After hearing this, she smiled and dismissed it, and there was nothing she could do. She did not expect that Jiang Yueying had been exposed for her improper behavior and used intimidation to force her husband to take her into his home. Her husband was forced by lust and smoothed things over with her, saying that it was like hiring a maid, so there was not much loss. If she did not let her move in, she would have to build another golden house, which would cost more. She was cowardly by nature and always listened to her husband's orders, so she reluctantly agreed. Later, Jiang Yueying was able to restrain her wild ambition and lived in peace. In February of this year, her husband went to Beiping to do business. Because of the busy business, he specially recruited his nephew Fan Weisheng to help. On March 3, she received a letter from her nephew Fan, reporting that her late husband had died of illness and that all the after-death accounts and other items were handled by her nephew Fan. He is currently still handling the matter in Beiping, and the coffin has not yet been transported back to Shanghai. All funeral affairs should be handled by her. She was suddenly caught off guard, and the pain of life was extreme. Just when she was in pain, Jiang Yueying took the opportunity to leave without saying goodbye. At that time, the widow was too busy to take care of herself. Jiang was a concubine, and her husband had died, so it was expected that she would leave, so she did not pay much attention to it. Unexpectedly, it was reported that Jiang Yueying had entrusted a lawyer to publish an advertisement, falsely claiming to be Cheng Zhong'an's wife, intending to illegally occupy her late husband's inheritance. After hearing this, she was deeply shocked. She found that the Bank of China passbook and the Tao Lechun passbook, as well as two ancient paintings, were stolen. It has now been found that Jiang Yueying is the wife of Zhou Along. Her husband died about four years ago, so she is indeed a widow. The defendant's background and her relationship with her late husband are as described above. Obviously, she intends to use her body to defraud money by fraud. Unfortunately, her late husband died shortly after they became concubines. Because her plan failed, she made a further attempt to repay kindness with hatred, vainly thinking of overturning the position of the wife of the solid evidence of the car, in order to illegally occupy the tools of the late husband's inheritance. Such a wolfish heart and dog lungs, illegal behavior, can be said to have reached the extreme. She requested that the court rule that she was indeed Cheng Zhong'an's wife and ordered her to return the stolen items in order to rectify her name and protect her property. Cheng Jiang's complaint stated that she married Cheng Zhong'an, a Sichuan native, at the Linfa Hotel in Zhengjia Muqiao, French Concession, in February of 1913 through the introduction of Wang Ziyang and others. For decades, the husband and wife lived together without any other words. In September of last year, they moved from No. 1 Yongqing Lane, Baxianqiao, French Concession, to Nanchang Lane, Tai'anfang, Zhaozhou Road. Not many days after entering the house, she suddenly saw the defendant and her husband Zhong'an come in from outside. At that time, she asked Zhong'an who she was. He told her that she (referring to the defendant) was my concubine. Therefore, there was a big quarrel. Later, through the mediation of fellow villagers, the defendant also indicated that she was willing to live in the position of concubine. Therefore, a storm subsided. In January of this year, the deceased husband Zhong'an went to Beiping for business. Unfortunately, in March, he suddenly fell ill. He received a letter from his nephew Fan Weisheng. The next day, he received another letter from his nephew, saying that he had passed away. At that time, she was not used to going far away, so she sent a letter to her nephew, entrusting him to handle the funeral affairs. As for the more than 3,000 yuan stored in the Bank of China and the Juxingcheng Bank by her husband during his lifetime, she asked a lawyer to send a letter to investigate and issued a statement in the Minxin newspapers, stating that no one should withdraw the money before the court issued a certificate of inheritance to her. The defendant, seeing that the deceased had bank savings, intended to seize the inheritance money, falsely claimed to be the successor of the deceased husband, and dared to apply for confirmation of her identity. What identity does such a shameless person have? She and her husband are legally married. When they got married in 1913, in addition to a public ceremony or through the introduction of the matchmaker Wang Ziyang, friends and relatives have known about it for more than ten years. The evidence is solid, and she also asked Liao Songbai, the president of the Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association, to testify in court to confirm it. She requested a public judgment according to law. At 8 am yesterday morning, Cheng Li's case against Jiang Yueying was heard by Judge Chen Wenkai in the First Court. Both parties arrived in court with lawyers. Everything they supplied was as described above. The magistrate ordered the hearing to be continued to gather witnesses for further review and decision.</p>

<p>Taiyi Factory Tragedy</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Orders the Bureau of Social Affairs to Investigate Thoroughly</h3>
<p>The deceased workers will be compensated according to the Factory Law. The families decided to file a lawsuit according to law yesterday. The necessity of inspecting factories is increasingly felt. Xin Sheng She reported that after the boiler explosion and fire at the Taiyi Wheat Essence Powder Factory in Hengqing Lane, Beile Road, French Concession, the Bureau of Social Affairs sent personnel to investigate thoroughly yesterday and make arrangements for the aftermath. Mayor Wu issued a statement expressing his determination to actively carry out factory inspections. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Dispatch Personnel to Investigate Thoroughly</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs specially dispatched Tian Heqing, director of the Factory Inspection Section, and Jiang Zhiyong, factory inspector, to the scene of the accident yesterday afternoon to investigate the truth of the explosion. At the same time, the bureau also sent personnel to investigate the number and details of the dead and injured workers in order to conduct a review. The deceased workers will be compensated according to the provisions of the Factory Law.</p>
<h3>Family Meeting</h3>
<p>The families of the deceased workers believe that this tragedy was caused by the factory's inadequate equipment. They have organized a family association of the deceased workers to handle registration, hire a lawyer, and decide to file a lawsuit with the court, and submit a report to the competent authorities for review. It is also reported that the factory has purchased fire insurance of 20,000 taels from insurance companies such as Ning Shao.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Remarks</h3>
<p>Reportedly, after receiving the news, Mayor Wu not only ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate the truth of the accident and handle the aftermath but also issued the following statement: "Within the Shanghai International Settlement, due to the failure to effectively implement factory inspections, disasters have become commonplace. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade, from 1927 to 1932, among the 3,404 fire and alarm calls, 391 originated from factories. The property losses resulting from these incidents were also greater for factories than for other types of establishments, accounting for 28% of the total amount. In 1927 alone, there were 56 factory fires and special incidents in the International Settlement, resulting in losses exceeding 750,000 taels of silver. In 1928, there were 44 incidents, with losses exceeding 120,000 taels. In 1929, there were 62 incidents, with losses exceeding 130,000 taels. In 1930, there were 67 incidents, with losses exceeding 250,000 taels. In 1931, there were 63 incidents, with losses exceeding 190,000 taels. In 1932, there were 99 incidents, with losses exceeding 100,000 taels. Over the six years, the total number of factory fires and special incidents in the International Settlement was 391, with losses exceeding 1,560,000 taels. The above refers to the International Settlement; the French Concession is not included. In the most recent year (1933), industrial disasters in Shanghai have become even more severe. According to daily reports in various newspapers, there were a total of 165 incidents throughout the year, resulting in over 410 deaths and injuries and losses estimated at over 2.3 million yuan. This year alone has seen multiple factory disasters. According to the statistics of the Industrial Safety Association, there were 46 incidents in January and February, resulting in 53 deaths and injuries. In March, there were 11 incidents, most of which were explosions or fires."</p>
<h3>Statistical Conclusions</h3>
<p>"Based on the above statistics, it is clear that implementing factory inspections in Shanghai is not only an effective method for preventing factory disasters in theory but also a pressing need in reality, compelled by objective phenomena. As Mayor, I am keenly aware of this and have therefore, in accordance with the Central Government's intentions and laws, repeatedly consulted with the settlement authorities on practical methods for inspecting factories. Unfortunately, these efforts have not yet been put into practice, resulting in a lack of improvement in factory equipment and management methods. This has led to this unfortunate and tragic disaster, which I deeply regret. However, after the lessons of this disaster, I am convinced that all those who care about the development of Shanghai's industry and sympathize with the lives of laborers will undoubtedly recognize factory inspections as an urgent and essential task for Shanghai."</p>
<p>Guohe Bridge, Jiangwan</p>
<h3>Body Found on Mud Dredger</h3>
<p>The boat owner is Japanese. The details of this bizarre case are as follows: At approximately 9:00 PM the night before last, a mud dredger was discovered moored on the riverbank near Guohe Road Bridge in Jiangwan. In addition to the boatman, Cao Xiaofu, the boat also contained the body of an unidentified male (approximately in his twenties) lying on the deck. At that time, Patrolman Song Rongfu of the Second Precinct of the Seventh District was patrolling near the bridge and discovered the boat. He immediately detained the boat and brought the boatman, Cao Xiaofu, to the station for preliminary questioning by the chief. During questioning, Cao Xiaofu stated that the boat owner was named Saito Moritaro and was Japanese. "Tonight (the night before last), as our boat passed the Donggou area of Pudong, a young man suddenly approached and offered two yuan for passage. The boat owner, Saito Moritaro, agreed to place the unidentified body on the boat and asked me to transport the body to Guohe Road Bridge. At the time, the young man claimed that the deceased had accidentally drowned while swimming in Pudong. The young man then left in a car, and the boat owner, Saito Moritaro, also left the boat. I transported the body to Guohe Road Bridge as instructed by the boat owner and waited for the young man and the boat owner to come and dispose of the body. Unexpectedly, I was discovered by the police and arrested. I do not know the name, age, origin, or address of the deceased, nor any other details." Due to the bizarre nature of the case, which involved a human life, the local headman was ordered to report to the Shanghai Local Court to send personnel to examine the cause of death. Plainclothes police officers were also dispatched to investigate the background of the deceased. Nanjing Municipal Government.</p>

<h3>New Information After the Reorganization of the Ta Chung Bank</h3>
<p>The headquarters of the Ta Chung Bank has moved from Tianjin to Shanghai, and the Shanghai branch has also been reorganized. The newly appointed manager, Mr. Huang Maoren, studied at the Tokyo Imperial University. After graduating and returning to China, he served as a professor at various universities and as the president of the Jiangxi Construction Bank. He has a deep understanding of world economic conditions and financial situations in various places. The deputy managers, Liu Jingyin and Lin Lianchen, and the assistant manager, Qin Pengnian, have also been working in the banking industry for a long time and are highly respected by the Shanghai financial community. The reorganization of the bank this time can be said to be a success. According to Mr. Huang, the bank's business will definitely develop steadily in the future, and it will do its best to support various emerging industries, in order to achieve the goal of serving society.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Shanghai Office for Southeast Transportation Exposition</h3>
<p>According to the Shen Poetry Society, with the Southeast Transportation Exposition approaching, everything needs to be carried out urgently. Therefore, the Shanghai office has been established at Room 32, No. 119 Renji Road in Shanghai. Yesterday, Zeng Yangfu, the chairman of the committee, appointed Wang Shiqi, a specialist from the Zhejiang Construction Department, as the director of the Shanghai office, and transferred Chen Yuqing, a staff member of the exposition, to Shanghai to assist. The office has already started working. All matters related to negotiations, publishing, publicity, purchasing, and consultation in Shanghai will be handled by the Shanghai office. In addition, since Shanghai is a gathering place for Chinese and foreign people, the number of tourists in the future must be very enthusiastic, so ticket sales will also be managed by the Shanghai office.</p>
<h3>Crowded United Premium Exchange Center</h3>
<p>Since the official opening of the United Premium Co., Ltd. on August 16th, the company has held opening sacrifice premiums in order to raise the interest of all sectors of society, which has been very popular among social figures. Among them, the Three Joys brand washbasin, the Crane brand towel, the large-size Beauty Incense Soap, and the first Shi toothpaste are the most popular. Therefore, the United Premium Exchange Center has been very crowded these days. The above four kinds of sacrifice premiums were quickly sold out. Now, in order to reward the requirements of all sectors of society, the company has moderately added sacrifice premiums to continue to exchange, and has set up temporary exchange points at Fuan Company in Xiaodongmen and Miaoji Company at the entrance of Renzhili in North Sichuan Road. Because the Huamei Tobacco Company's Hong Mai Si Gan cigarettes and other purchases add more coupons, it is very easy to get coupons. Previously, Mr. Ling of Wuxi Samsung Cotton Weaving Factory purchased celebrity brand incense and obtained 1,000 coupons, which he held to the United Premium Exchange Center and selected various premiums for exchange, such as Huafu gold pens, Crane brand towels, China Underwear Company underwear, and many other items, and returned full of goods.</p>

<h3>Shanghai National Goods Company</h3>
<h3>Autumn Grand Sale</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Company, located opposite the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road, has always been based on promoting national goods and does not specialize in profit-making. Therefore, the various goods it sells are sacrificed at low prices. At the beginning of autumn, in addition to clearing out the summer inventory and selling it all at a special pre-capital price, it has also been planned in advance by the company's managers Wu Zhihao and Lu Qisheng, and has been successively transported to various famous domestic manufacturers and local specialties from various places.

<h3>Inability to See One's Own Progress</h3>
<p>In many reading reports, it is stated that there is no progress. Some are sighing, some are self-hating, and some are carrying a bit of humility. Regardless of the mood in which the person writing the report is writing, we cannot completely regard this phenomenon as unimportant without giving a reasonable explanation.</p>
<p>The desire for progress in reading is a general psychology. Why read if there is no progress? However, readers are often too hasty and take learning too easily. We only need to look at the slippery books such as "English in 100 Days" in the bookstores to understand that there is originally a kind of fluke mentality and speculation mentality in reading in society. Of course, being hasty is not necessarily a speculative mentality, but it is somewhat related to the speculative mentality. At least we can say that the psychology of hoping too quickly does not understand the process of reading and does not understand progress in the process.</p>
<p>So, what is the so-called process of reading? The process of reading is the assumption that it starts from a certain subject and a certain field and reaches the predetermined end. Between these two points, our knowledge is increasing and expanding every day. Old, erroneous, and incorrect concepts are being corrected every day, and new, correct concepts are being cultivated every day. This process is often very slow, and sometimes we cannot even see it ourselves, so we often hear people say, "I cannot see my own progress." This statement is half true. Does not being able to see one's own progress mean that there is no progress? No! It is not like this. This phenomenon is especially true in technical training. For example, in the past, copying inscriptions not only could not see the progress of the characters written today compared to the characters written yesterday, but even comparing them with those written several months ago, it is sometimes impossible to tell the reason for the progress. Painting is the same phenomenon, and it is often the case in learning science. For example, in studying social science, although you have read a lot, you only feel that you know a little about everything, and when you ask, you inevitably know nothing. As for application, it is naturally even more impossible. What is the reason for this? Is this because there is no progress? Cannot see progress? It is not. Originally, progress is accumulated. It will not change in quality unless it reaches saturation in terms of quantity. Progress is a manifestation of praise, and it can also promote the increase in quantity. The change in quality from quantitative change often goes through a slow process, and it will not change until it reaches a certain level. Therefore, when it seems to you that there is no progress, it is precisely when you are progressing, you are progressing every day. A famous writer often cannot see his own talent and cannot be confident before he becomes famous. How can he be welcomed by the world? That is, he is still in the process of creating himself, because this process is arduous and slow, and sometimes he not only loses self-confidence, but even becomes anxious and disappointed. This is a very common fact and is not surprising.</p>
<p>Being hasty is sometimes like an abortion, because the baby in the mother's body has not reached the ten-month gestation period and has been raised in two or three months. This baby must be an unfinished dead thing, not a living child. We respect those who bury their heads in hard work and do not care about success or failure, just like we respect mothers, who do not care about success or failure. Not not really caring, but being able to endure in the process. This is like a mother suffering for ten months for the sake of raising her own child.</p>
<p>However, is there no phenomenon of sudden expression of progress in reading? I replied, there is. After all, reading is not like giving birth to a child. The above analogy can only explain one aspect and cannot explain the whole. The so-called sudden leap, in reading, is the same as in natural phenomena and other social phenomena, they all exist. For example, in the understanding of thought and in cognition, it often leaps due to major social events, without having to go through a very long process. When reading literature books, it is often because of changes in one's own life that one suddenly has a special understanding of a certain writer. There are many such things.</p>
<p>However, human actions are conscious. Although reading does not have to be hasty, it is not to say that it should be allowed to crawl slowly like a turtle. We should still shorten the process of achieving progress with all efforts. Only in this way can it be said to be a scientific view of reading.</p>
<p>(2) Important Announcement</p>
<h3>Alternative Methods for Readers Outside Shanghai to Use Stationery for Correspondence</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the statistics and preservation of readers' letters, this department has produced a kind of ("Reader's Correspondence Stationery"), which has been changed to be used uniformly by readers from both Shanghai and other places since August 1st. Now, because the mailing of this stationery has encountered great difficulties. According to the regulations of the post office, stationery cannot be sent as printed matter, and must be repacked into packages. Therefore, a stationery book, priced at only two cents, costs four cents to send to other provinces and two cents within the province. This greatly conflicts with our principle of always cherishing the economic burden of readers and only charging the cost price of stationery. Now, in order to change the method, readers who have already registered in this department in other places will of course be better if they can purchase this stationery, but they can purchase three books at a time, and the shipping fee is still four cents. Those who have not registered in this department, or who cannot afford the economic ability, can temporarily change to using ordinary manuscript paper, and indicate the number of communications, registration number, communication address, and the nature of the questions asked in each communication. Readers in Shanghai, please go to the cashier of this library to purchase it! (3) Solicitation of Abridged Versions of Reading Life We are very eager to know about readers of all kinds of occupations, and write their own reading life into short articles of 500 to 1,000 words and send them to us for publication in this journal. However, the article focuses on the special life part of each person, and general phenomena can be omitted. We think this is the most important kind of knowledge communication to understand life. I hope enthusiastic friends will hurry up and get started! By the way, all the letters published in ("Reading Questions and Answers") and all the texts published in this journal are provided unconditionally by like-minded people, and there are no royalties.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Temporality</h3>
<p>— Fan</p>
<p>In the past, I heard that Confucius was a sage who adapted to the times. Waving a fan in summer and surrounding a stove in winter are in accordance with the seasons. Surrounding a stove in summer, startling sweat like rain, or waving a banana leaf fan in the north wind in winter, this person is at least somewhat crazy, and everything is disordered. — Confucius's strength lies here.</p>
<p>When those in positions of power respect Confucius and read the classics, what they respect is probably not Confucius's original intention. For example, if ancient music were restored, Confucius would certainly not be able to bear listening to it if he were to be reborn. In "The Scholars," Mr. Ma Er thought (if Confucius were born today), how would it be, and it is even imagined that if Ma Er (were born today), he would definitely think that Confucius would take a plane to survey the world and watch movies and not know the taste of meat for three months. Because he is someone who adapts to the times.</p>
<p>However, mixing the ancient and the modern, and advancing both the Chinese and the Western, is not only disordered but also laborious and ineffective. That is, surrounding the stove and waving the fan at the same time, one moment it is scorching heat and the next it is severe cold. Those who (govern the country) always like to compare themselves to doctors, but doctors do not simultaneously prescribe cold and hot medicines, and they are unlikely to benefit the sick.</p>
<p>The theories of people in both the government and the opposition have recently become very disordered again. One side says peace, and the other side says it is also peace. One side says freedom does not exist, and the other side says freedom does not exist either. One side says to focus on facts and not to engage in empty talk, and the other side also says to focus on facts and not to engage in empty talk. So, wouldn't that be (the same wind) and (going to the national crisis together)? However, it is clear that one side is fighting for freedom, and the other side does not want freedom. One side wants peace, and the other side does not want peace. One side does not allow empty talk, and the other side cannot engage in empty talk. The climates are different, with cold, heat, warmth, and coolness. The soup is one name, but the medicines are two different kinds. The diagnosis and posturing for the patient are consistent. — This is called disorder.</p>
<p>Using this standard to look at the major powers from afar and the contemporary figures up close, it is possible to see some reasons. — Alas! Have the fools and idiots in the world not all died yet? Are they disciples of Confucius?</p>
<h3>Get Down to Practical Work</h3>
<p>— Meng Ke</p>
<p>The question of (the vernacular) has truly been discussed for a long time. However, despite all the discussion, the problem remains the same. Looking at the current situation, even those engaged in the debate seem to be showing signs of fatigue. If things continue like this, I'm afraid it won't be long before the winds calm and the waves subside. I think the conclusion to this problem can only be reached through the effects of practice. If we want this problem to be resolved, we must go among the masses and put it into practice.</p>
<p>Some people are already asking to see (examples of the vernacular). It's hard to say they shouldn't. Of course, since the question is currently under discussion, a completely (vernacular) work is impossible to produce right now. But why can't we temporarily take the more common language and create some simple writings? Using the subjects and styles of reading material that the masses are now accustomed to and fond of, let's try it out among the masses. The central reading material for the masses is still old novels like *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* and *Water Margin*. We could transform their content and language and publish new *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, new *Water Margin*-like pamphlets, and distribute them to street vendors to sell. Then, from the experience and lessons of this practice, we can further reform and enrich our writing, making it closer to the masses and connecting it with their real lives. In the future, when the masses read more of our material, that will be our victory, and it can also be said that (the vernacular) has embarked on the road to completion. On the other hand, we also need to have a variety of so-called (popular) publications (preferably weeklies), distributed to book vendors for distribution. The content should focus on describing and recording the real lives of the masses, with many communication and Q&amp;A sections, and solicit writing from the masses themselves to train true vernacular writers. There is a bi-weekly publication on the market called "Lianhuan" (picture books) that is similar in nature, but it is a bit like "New Life," with a lot of profound arguments and May Fourth-style vernacular that people without a middle school education cannot understand. It needs to be even more (popular).</p>
<p>This kind of work may be very difficult, and requires capital to start. But I think that publishing (popular) pamphlets and publications shouldn't have worse sales than other books and magazines. As long as someone is willing to do it, bookstores may not be unwilling to print them. Many of the gentlemen who participated in the (vernacular) discussion have connections with bookstores. I hope that enthusiastic individuals won't overlook these matters.</p>
<h3>Selling Liangfen (Mung Bean Jelly)</h3>
<p>— Zhi De</p>
<p>That day, there wasn't a single cloud in the sky, the blue even more clear.</p>
<p>Overhead, the intensely blue sky held a violent sun. As it rose from the earth, everything seemed as if it were enclosed in a steamer, gasping for breath suffocatingly. On the cracked red earth, shimmering heat rose, making one dizzy. The stifling wind blew the drooping branches and leaves of the trees, like a drunken drunkard, shaking his twisted head. The stream in the creek had also been dry for a long time. As for the green seedlings in the fields, although they had been irrigated by human labor before—when the stream still had water—in the past few days, after being scorched by the even more brutal sunlight, they were finally, pitifully, withered to the point of being on their last breath.</p>
<p>Now, it had been more than twenty days since a single drop of rain had been seen here. A few days ago—when the signs of drought had just appeared—the people here had also used sincere faith, concentrating their entire spirit, to set up altars, burn incense, and pray to the gods for rain, hoping to exchange the piety of the masses for timely rain to relieve the heat and save them from famine. However, the result was terrible. Not only had not a single raindrop fallen in so many days, but the weather had become drier day by day. Because of this, the (spirit) and (faith) of these common villagers had nowhere to place their hopes. Therefore, under the oppressive power of this humid heat, they could only mope in their own homes, sighing to the sky or complaining about (the will of Heaven).</p>
<p>A deathly silence, a gloomy atmosphere, enveloped the village.</p>
<p>At noon on this day, a selling cry drifted from the village entrance:</p>
<p>"Liangfen…!" The tone was hoarse. Wang Shunzi, a man in his thirties, was gaunt and haggard, probably suffering from some debilitating disease. He pushed his *liangfen* cart, staggering as he walked over from the other side.</p>
<p>"Liangfen, *liangfen*…!" As he entered the village, he didn't stop for a moment, calling out as he walked. After circling twice, not only had he not made any sales, but he hadn't even encountered a single inquiry. Moreover, at this time, because of the repeated calls, he felt as if there was a hot flame burning in his throat. The scorching sun beat down on his angular, dark and sallow skin, as painful as acupuncture. Sweat poured down like rain… his entire pants were soaked, looking like a waterlogged chicken.</p>
<p>"What hot weather!" He murmured, looking up at the sky. Then he greedily looked around: here, there, it was all silence. Except for the noisy and monotonous cicada calls in the treetops, everything else was silent, without a sound.</p>
<p>"Alas!" Then, he sighed again. At the same time, he hoped to find some cool shade to rest.</p>
<p>However, suddenly, a painful emotion surged into his heart. He remembered that the money pouch was still (empty); the *liangfen* in the jar had already started to smell a bit sour. Because of this, he couldn't help but immediately recall how this *liangfen* had come to be—it was exchanged for his wife's only pair of pants!</p>
<p>Thus, two images appeared before his eyes—two images that he didn't want to see, but had to see every day: one was a woman stripped naked, his wife; the other was a child who was thin and only bones, even though he was already six years old, he couldn't even walk due to hunger—but his child would have tears in his eyes, crawling towards him, muttering with weak lips—"Dad, hungry, hungry!" crying…</p>
<p>This tragic scene, like a sharp blade piercing his heart, made him tremble. Therefore, he no longer had the courage to seek his own relief and stop the cart; he simply swallowed two mouthfuls of sour water to relieve his thirst, and then gritted his teeth, struggling to push the cart and cry out: "Liangfen!" fighting against the scorching sun...</p>
<p>However, this time he continued for less than half an hour. First, his hoarse voice turned into a low sound like a flute. The soles of his feet, scorched by the red earth, had swollen with blisters; stepping on the hot earth again was simply unbearable.</p>
<p>Then, he felt dizzy and his head felt swollen, throbbing with pain as if it had suddenly increased several times. However, what he couldn't bear the most was that the few mouthfuls of sour water he had just swallowed were now churning in his empty stomach, igniting the flames of extreme hunger! He hadn't eaten for more than three days.</p>
<p>Thus, attacked by heat and hunger, his heart suddenly entered a state of severe panic. It seemed as if countless sparks were bursting out of his eyes, and his whole body twitched violently as if shivering from the cold… Gradually, his heavy footsteps couldn't support his heavy body, and his trembling limbs couldn't hold onto the cart! Finally, he fell to the side of the road, man and cart together.</p>
<p>However, at that instant, the two distressing images remained tightly clutched in his heart.</p>
<p>The June sun, scorching, poisonous, cruel, like a gray net, enveloped the village, which became silent and gloomy, with only the cicada calls in the treetops as a single ornament. In addition, there were swarms of flies humming, gleefully clustering around a corpse—that was Wang Shunzi's remains.</p>
<h3>To a Child</h3>
<p>— Gan Yongjiu</p>
<p>In this August dusk, with the drunken wind blowing, chrysanthemums and late lotuses are quietly withering; child, you lead this last, late darkness, silently crawling into the black gauze: your little eyes are wistfully fixed, are you yearning for the unfinished future, or grieving for the parents who disappeared in (He Bo)'s tyranny? Yes, you must also be thinking of: the tulips in the dusk before the thatched hut, and the shadows of the huge cypress, and the shy chrysanthemums sleeping at night, and the wild blackberries growing in the wet soil. Your little hands are curled, perhaps trying to wield the hoe that your grandfather and father once held? And your small wrist strength is also prepared to share a portion of your mother's labor. But you can't do it now, ah, my poor child! Your small, fallen body makes my heart hurt, I pray: (Time, let me keep this memory forever!)</p>
<h3>Rickshaw?</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Old Man (9)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>Like himself, although he had always been far away from his hometown, doing business in a foreign land, he was also a good citizen of the Russian Empire. Every two or three years, he would return to the embrace of his homeland once, where he felt all the warmth and comfort. That boundless wilderness, and the wind floating over the wilderness, carrying the fragrance of flowers, the fragrance of grass, and the fragrance of soil, seemed to give him the strength to be reborn, soothing his hardships on the long road of life. He looked at those luxurious nobles and great landowners, but he never had a bit of resentment. In their arrogant lives, he saw a larger world, and he thought that their enjoyment was a very fair thing. But those rioters ruined everything and made him lose the opportunity to step onto his homeland again. He cursed to himself (when friends who had the same experience came, they cursed together). He swore not to open his eyes to see the rebels' rebellious behavior; but from time to time he thought of that wilderness, the wind floating over the wilderness, and the fragrance rolled up in that wind. He longed for it. He lowered his head and vented the resentment surging in his chest with endless curses. He even had great ambitions, but when he thought of his own age, he extinguished that ambition again. He thought despairingly to himself! (Before I meet death, I will never be able to return to my homeland!)</p>
<p>In this moment of silence, they both lowered their heads, as if this would go on endlessly, and no one knew what to say. Finally, it was his loud sigh that awakened the frozen situation, and they each remembered that they should say something.</p>
<p>Straightening his body and waving his two thick, fleshy arms, A Li Sai yawned at will. Then he wiped away the tears that squeezed out of his eyes, and suddenly stood up from his seat as if he had remembered something very important.</p>
<p>"Old man, I have something to bring you."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he searched in his pocket with his fat hands. He seemed very excited, but he failed. He didn't take anything out of his pocket.</p>
<p>Seeing him sitting there as if indifferently, he said:</p>
<p>"It's about Sasha—"</p>
<p>This caught his attention. He immediately asked what was going on, whether any letters had been brought. He repeatedly asked Ari Sai to search carefully again. He said in a lower voice that he was willing to know a little news about Sasha.</p>
<p>In order to search, Ari Sai even had sweat on his head (this was not sweat from work, but came out of anxiety). He almost turned the bottom of his pocket over, and took out the handkerchief, snack bags, cigarettes, and other things inside, but he still didn't find it. His face flushed, his veins bulged, and he panted like a cow, making Father Akhtanov feel very sorry. Although he was more anxious to know about Sasha, he said this:</p>
<p>"Sit down and rest. Maybe you forgot to bring it. It doesn't matter. I don't care. Alas, Sasha, that child, isn't a good, obedient child either."</p>
<p>Ari Sai felt very apologetic, shaking his head and wiping the sweat from his face with his handkerchief. He was preparing to sit down, but suddenly something triggered his memory, and he reached into the back pocket of his trousers and pulled out a roughly cut square piece of print.</p>

The complexity of the content of each item should be appropriately allocated according to the total teaching time of each semester, so as not to fall into the disadvantage of not being able to complete the teaching. (8) When explaining the teaching materials, attention should be paid to actual social survey materials and recent discoveries. (End) Drafted by the Ministry of Education</p>
<h3>Completion of University Medical Education Curriculum</h3>
<p>▲ A meeting will be convened in early September to discuss the fact that the Ministry of Education has already formulated, promulgated, and implemented the curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools and kindergartens. The curriculum standards and material outlines for teacher training and vocational schools have already been drafted by staff members and have been discussed in repeated meetings. The teaching hour tables for various types of teacher training have been published, and the vocational part has been largely determined. It is still under revision. The curriculum standards for secondary and primary education will be brought to a close. There has never been a unified method for curriculum standards for higher education. The first step of the Ministry of Education is to start with medical education. A few months ago, the Ministry hired medical education experts to organize a medical education committee. After repeated meetings, the principles for compiling the curriculum were determined, and staff members were hired to draft them separately. The draft medical education curriculum has now been completed and has been sent to the Ministry of Education. It is said that the Ministry of Education is organizing and compiling it. It is said that a meeting of the committee members will be convened in early September to discuss it. Jiangsu</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Education in the Drought</h3>
<p>▲ Borrowing to Issue One Month's Expenses to Each School for the Start of the Semester The funds for middle schools in Jiangsu Province for June have been released in July (because the school administrative income fees are deducted, the actual provincial treasury expenditure is limited). The notification letters for the funds for social education institutions, vocational schools, and normal schools (normal schools were originally issued together with middle schools, but later, because they did not have food expenses income like middle schools to draw on, they were changed to be issued half a month earlier together with social education and vocational schools) for the second half of June and the first half of July, and the funds for primary schools for the entire month of July have been issued a few days ago. Each school can withdraw from the bank around the 25th of this month. Due to this drought, the tax revenue of various counties in Jiangsu has been greatly reduced. Jiangsu schools will start school in late this month and need funds urgently. It is heard that the Jiangsu Education Fee Management Office plans to borrow funds as usual (in previous years, when finances were tight in the summer, they borrowed funds from banks. The funds borrowed from the bank last year have already been repaid) to issue one month's funds to each school to meet the needs of each school's opening. It is also heard that the Jiangsu Education Fee Audit Committee also expressed its approval of borrowing funds at a meeting a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Adds Official Residences</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education does not have enough offices for various departments to use (the Ordinary and Social Affairs Departments of the Counselor's Office are located in a corner, the Social and Home Education Departments are located in one office, the Supervisor's Office and the Northeast Youth Education Relief Office each have an office in a small room, and the Commissioner's Office is in a corner of the library). The offices of the Ministers and Vice Ministers are not comfortable, and the conference room can only accommodate more than ten people. It is necessary to expand the official residence. A new base and bungalow have now been purchased in Shuangjing Alley behind the Ministry (not many rooms need to be renovated) and connected to the Ministry's building. The Ministry of Education has appointed members to organize the Ministry of Education Office Building Construction Committee and has already held meetings to carry out planning. Construction can begin within this month. China</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony of the Annual Meeting of the Social Education Society</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The third annual meeting of the Chinese Social Education Society was held at the Provincial Kaifeng Junior High School at around 7:00 a.m. on the 17th. More than 130 members, including Li Zheng, Yu Qingtang, and Meng Xiancheng, attended. Chairman Li Zheng presided over the meeting as usual. Director Yu Qingtang first stated that the social education movement began seven or eight years ago. When the first annual meeting was held in Hangzhou, there were only more than 200 members. Last year, when the second annual meeting was held in Jinan, it had reached more than 600 people. Including the 211 new members such as Lu Chuanshan, etc., approved by yesterday's eight board meetings, this year's number exceeds 1,000. Currently, all provinces in the country except Xinjiang have members of our society. Among the more than 130 people who attended today, there were a total of eleven provinces. The central discussion topic of the first annual meeting was rural education, the second session was rural construction, and this year's session will focus on the implementation methods of rural construction and national revival. The Industrial Experimental Zone run by our society in Luoyang has been in operation for four months. The purpose is to use people's schools as a foundation to take responsibility for eliminating illiteracy. Next, Yu Gongdu reported on the preparations. Representative Zhang sent by the Central Party Department and Division Chief Zhang sent by the Ministry of Education delivered training speeches in turn. Subsequently, Henan Provincial Party Department Representative Wang Xingzhou, Provincial Government Representative Li Jingzhai, Director of the Education Department Qi Zhenru, and Acting President of Henan University Du Jun made speeches one after another. Finally, representatives from the Education Departments of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and other provinces reported on the implementation of social education in their respective provinces. The meeting adjourned at around 11:00 a.m., and it was decided to hold a general meeting starting at 2:00 p.m. to organize the review meeting and the election and vote counting of directors.</p>
<h3>Central University Relocation Construction Fee</h3>
<p>▲ Eighty Thousand Yuan Per Month This Year's Implementation (Nanjing, 20th Telegram) The National Government has approved the Central Political Council's letter, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang of China passed the motion to transfer the construction fee of Central University to the suburbs of 80,000 yuan per month, which has been resolved and should be implemented by the Executive Yuan this year. The National Government has instructed the Executive Yuan to comply. High schools and above schools in this city</p>
<h3>The Second Batch of Summer Military Training Began Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Director Jiao Will Personally Inspect Each School ▲ It Has Not Yet Been Ordered to Stop Summer Training Next Year The second batch of summer military training for high schools and above schools in this city began yesterday in separate schools over three days. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Military Training Begins Yesterday</h3>
<p>The summer military training for high schools and above in this city is held in two batches. The first batch, including thirteen schools such as Tongji, Merchant Marine, Fudan, Min San, Jingye, and Shanghai High School, was completed in mid-July. The second batch, except for Pudong High School, which started on the 16th, includes more than ten schools such as Jiaotong, Jida, Sino-French Institute of Technology, Datong, Dongya, Business School, Zhengfeng, College, Hujiang, Fudan Affiliated High School, Jinan Affiliated High School, Nanyang High School of Commerce, Huiling, Junyi, Zhaohe, and Mulun. All of them started training separately within three days starting yesterday.</p>
<h3>Training Subjects Remain the Same as the First Batch</h3>
<p>The training subjects for the second batch are the same as those for the first batch, and the duration is still three weeks, under the command of the instructors. It was previously decided that when the first batch started, instructors from the schools in the second batch would be transferred, and when the second batch started, instructors from the schools in the first batch would be transferred again. However, due to the fact that most of the instructors from the schools in the first batch of military training have returned home and have not yet come out, there are still not enough instructors for application. It has now been decided to consult with the city's defense corps to dispatch 20 instructors to assist.</p>
<h3>Director Jiao Will Inspect in Person</h3>

<h3>Physical Educationist Jin Zhaojun Goes to the United States</h3>
<p>▲Enrolling in the University of Iowa for further studies. Jin Zhaojun, a native of Zhuji, Zhejiang, was the first graduate of the second class of the Physical Education Department of the former National Nanjing Higher Normal School. He is honest, does not know fame and wealth, and has served in the physical education field for thirteen years, deeply praised by all parties. In his studies, he must investigate the reasons for every problem and is unwilling to be ambiguous in the slightest. In his work, he is courageous in taking responsibility and buries himself in hard work. Therefore, every time he goes to a place, there must be the construction of new undertakings, giving people a deep impression. He has been a lecturer in the Physical Education Department of Central University for many years, and those who have been taught by him all respect him. Colleagues are also harmonious and able to cooperate. Recently, as a physical education instructor at the Central Aviation School, he has put a lot of effort into expanding the site, setting up the arena, purchasing equipment, and arranging various plans. In the past year, the results have been obvious. However, Mr. Jin is still not satisfied. He specially paid for his trip to the United States on the Grant Presidential ship today to study further in the Department of Physical Education at the University of Iowa. He plans to return to China in two years. When he returns to China, he also plans to take a detour to Europe to refer to physical education for reference, in order to learn from it. His spirit of humbly seeking knowledge and striving for progress is truly commendable. Mr. Jin's old friends in Shanghai specially held a farewell dinner for him at the McBain French Restaurant on Nanjing Road last night to bid him farewell, it is said. Recent photo of Jin Zhaojun.</p>
<p>Educational Film Fee</p>
<h3>Pay Once, No More Collection</h3>
<p>▲Every student can watch for free until graduation. ▲Wuben, Liangjiang, and other schools have already started soliciting. The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Educational Film Association, since its organization and establishment last year, has implemented educational film screenings in schools in this city as an initial work. Last semester, it screened in 1057 schools, 1134 sessions, with more than 520,000 viewers. The results were remarkable. This time, after receiving approval from the Ministry of Education to collect educational film fees, and the Municipal Education Bureau separately issued letters to all large, medium, and small schools within the city to collect the fees, dozens of schools, such as Municipal Wuben Girls' High School, Chaozong Elementary School, Xijiang Elementary School, Yucai Elementary School, Liangjiang Physical Education College, and Huiqun Girls' High School, have successively filled out student numbers and sent letters to the association to request receipts and start collecting on their behalf. However, a small number of schools are not fully aware of the Ministry of Education's approved method of collecting educational film fees once by the association and do not know whether to collect each semester or each academic program. Yesterday, the person in charge of the association told reporters that after students of all sizes and elementary schools pay the educational film fee once, they will be able to watch the educational films screened by the association for free until graduation, and no other fees will be collected. Schools will also not have to pay transportation fees, it is said.</p>

Therefore, he took a fast train to Beijing with his wife, Ms. Jiang Bihui, at 9:00 yesterday morning to report to the Ministry of Education on the exhibition of the painting society. Before leaving, he told the reporter of Guowen News Agency that the achievements of this painting have indeed advanced the status of our country a lot. It is estimated that the number of visitors from various countries totaled more than 100,000, all of whom praised it and had a very deep impression of our people. If it can continue to be held on a large scale, it will be enough to correct the psychology of the blue-eyed people who despise our people. I (Xu's self-proclaimed) brought back many famous paintings from various countries this time. The thirteen famous paintings exchanged with the Russian government have also been telegraphed, saying that they should be sent by the end of this year. Therefore, I plan to hold a European painting exhibition in Beijing and Shanghai next autumn, so that the Chinese people can also understand the progress of European culture to what extent, and communicate with each other's inherent culture to connect feelings and enhance international sympathy, it is said.

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Ghosts Carry a Cartload from Guanzhong, Transient Guests Have Bare Walls, Ferry Crossing Mourns the Qin People</p>
<p>The Tongxi Highway extends westward from the west gate of Tongguan County. In the plains, one can see a cluster of yellow mist from afar, rising two or three zhang high and rolling westward. This is the surface dust kicked up by cars speeding on the road. The dust on the road rolls up into yellow mist all day long, secretly telling us that cars from the east are increasing day by day. These cars come from the United States, Germany, and France, or other countries. Although 99% of the people in the cars are compatriots, the proportion of imported goods is almost inversely proportional to the people, accounting for only 1% or 2%. Most of these goods come from Japan, England, or the United States and Russia. In short, 80% to 90% come from foreign countries. This trend, like the extension of the Tongxi Highway, and the future extension of the Landi Highway, will only increase. On this highway, a German car, traveling at a speed of 30 miles per hour, kicked up yellow dust and sped forward. This car, like other cars on the highway, is used for both passengers and cargo. In the driver's seat sat a driver and two Germans, which was the first-class compartment. The rear was the cargo body, piled with dozens of boxes of gasoline. On top of the gasoline boxes were boxes, net baskets, camp beds, and even large wooden crates containing hundreds of bottles of beer, stacked layer upon layer, forming a small hill. Sitting on top of this pile of goods were four people, all compatriots. Two were from Tianjin and were working as helpers for the two Germans in the front. They were very enthusiastic about their duties, helping the Germans develop their business. One was called Zhao Guofu, and the other was called Wang Laowu. There were also two other people. One was from Zhejiang, who came to Shaanxi to look for work, but did not specify what he wanted to do. He was called Zhang Jiefu. The other was from Jiangsu, speaking with a Shanghai accent, who came to try to get a job in the tax bureau or donation bureau. He was called Li Shilian. (1)</p>
<h3>Drought</h3>
<p>— Huang Yiping</p>
<p>The Heavenly Emperor doesn't send rain, he's just going to let us poor people die one by one! Isn't that so? In this village: some are lying down, some are working to death, how many people have been ruined already?!</p>
<p>Not counting before, just look at right now, in our east village; there's Old Man Zhang, Uncle Lao Shun, A Jin, Tian Guan, Little Yuzi and his dad... so many people! Women are weak after all, so many have fallen: there's Sister-in-law Senquan, Sister A Cui, Sister-in-law Li, the Yin Gu sisters, and the two daughters-in-law of the Yao Tou Mama... and more than that; some families have one person lying down, some have two or three, you can't say them all for a while; the front village, the west village, aren't even counted in, there's already so many people!</p>
<p>More have worked themselves to death; can't even count them all!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, twelve people from the front village were drawing water: among them, four people, because the field work was too busy, they really couldn't handle it; they were always working day and night. They hadn't had a good sleep or a good meal for several days; they just fell off the axle on the spot and fainted! In the end: three died, only one was saved!</p>
<p>Yesterday, I heard that two old women also died in the west village, both of them fell off the axle and that was the end of them.</p>
<p>There's Little Chun's mother here! A little widow of thirty years old: her mining husband just died the year before last. There's a blind grandmother of seventy years old at home, guarding two children: one is three years old, one is five years old, she relies on her alone to work and support them. Unexpectedly, for a month now: weeding rice, drawing water, and the weather is so hot! And there are so few people! If you don't work, you don't eat, you just drag on, if you overwork yourself, you just kneel in the field and die! No one even knows; later someone saw her head drooping straight down, still not moving! They went to call her, and pushed her, not knowing that she had already died!</p>
<p>Because there's no money, the one who died the day before yesterday is still lying there without a coffin.</p>
<p>Poor thing! The whole family is crying and shouting, even onlookers feel sad!</p>
<p>Heavenly God! I wonder how much longer before you give us a heavy rain? Save us poor people!</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Zhen)</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's trip to Japan, I wonder what it was for? According to his own account; he received a very warm welcome from the government and public in Japan. Cannons were fired and bells were rung everywhere, as if welcoming an emperor or paying homage to a Bodhisattva, showing that famous Chinese people are extraordinary after all. I imagine that during the Shanghai January 28th Incident, Mr. Xiang Songmao and several thousands of others, lying in eternal sleep underground, watching Mr. Wang return triumphantly, must be whispering to each other: (How envious we are!)</p>
<h3>Street Musician</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The street musician, every day at dusk, carries two blue cloth bags, one hanging in front of his chest, one hanging on his back. Inside the bags are many flutes, xiao, erhu, jinghu, and the like. He also holds a jinghu in his hand, adjusts the strings, and, following the rhythm, plays many opera tunes, walking along the street while playing. When he's tired of playing the jinghu, he switches to a flute. He's a versatile musician.</p>
<p>On both sides of the street, there are often many people chatting and cooling off. Most of them are opera fans. Hearing the sound of the musician's jinghu coming from afar, they closely follow the tune and hum: (I am like a bird in a cage...). Even when the musician has walked far away and the sound of the jinghu can no longer be heard, they still hum incessantly.</p>
<p>The musician comes out every day to sell these musical instruments. If someone wants to patronize him, he will also teach you in a very authentic way.</p>
<p>One day, I bought a flute from him, gave him two dimes, and asked him to give me sixteen copper coins in change, but he groped in his bag for a long time, but couldn't find them. He frowned and said to me: (Can't find them).</p>
<p>(Alas! This kind of hard work, running around for so long, can only earn a few cents!) He muttered to himself, while strenuously playing a section of (Mulberry Garden Sends a Son), and strode away.</p>

<h3>Watermelon Lantern</h3>
<p>— Shen Qin</p>
<p>Watermelon is the only wonderful product to quench thirst and relieve summer heat. Its skin is mottled green; its flesh is red and yellow; its juice is very sweet, truly possessing all three qualities of color, aroma, and taste.</p>
<p>I remember when I was young, I often picked a round, mottled green watermelon, opened a small hole on top, scooped out the flesh, leaving a very thin rind, almost transparent. Then I used a small knife to carve many figures, landscapes, flowers, and other patterns on the outer skin, lit a candle in the middle, and hung it on the window, it was a cool lantern.</p>
<p>I also remembered a story. When I was young, cooling off on summer nights, my uncle always told many stories. Once he said:</p>
<p>(The Qing Tongzhi Emperor was very fond of pleasure. One summer night, he was cooling off in the Imperial Garden, and his attendants offered him watermelons. Somehow, it aroused his interest, and he issued an edict to the concubines, asking everyone to go back and make watermelon lanterns, and bring them to compare their ingenuity tomorrow. Whoever won the championship would of course be rewarded with precious things. Sure enough, the next evening, there was such a grand event in the Imperial Garden. Lanterns filled the sky and the earth, all carved from watermelons, and it suddenly became a world of watermelon lanterns. Under the evaluation, the lantern presented by the Lotus Consort, carved with a scene of the Xiaoxiang Pavilion in spring, drowsy and secluded: from the window of the pavilion, through the hanging curtains, one could vaguely see Lin Daiyu's delicate and sleepy posture, the meticulous workmanship made the Tongzhi Emperor rejoice, and immediately, she received the top prize, a jade watermelon; it was natural, not man-made),</p>
<p>Ah, I wonder if this famous treasure still exists now? Perhaps it was taken away when the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded? Who knows?</p>
<h3>The Fragrant Mists of the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Original text by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I dare say the Empress Dowager would never have thought of what impact her (severing traffic) ban would have on others; even if she did, she would certainly consider it a matter of course, and would never feel any pity or unease because of it.</p>
<p>The train stopped at Fengtai Station. Looking out of the train window, I couldn't see a single idle person. As far as I knew, this place used to be very lively, but now it had become as desolate as a desert, not even a sound could be heard; I couldn't help but admire the talent and courage of these local officials, who would use any harsh means to cater to the Empress Dowager. But what would the people, who were strictly forbidden to approach the station, or even to casually glance at our imperial train, think of the Empress Dowager's passage here this time? I'm afraid no one would notice. I guess they must be imagining with a special sense of tension that the Heavenly Elder who protects them is passing through here. Originally, the emperor had the title of (Son of Heaven), so the Empress Dowager and the Heavenly Elder must have a corresponding relationship; even if she represents the Heavenly Elder, it is not impossible, anyway, her authority is indeed no less than that of the Heavenly Elder!</p>
<p>Because it was still springtime, the carp, a specialty of the Baihe River, happened to be a very seasonal gift. So when our train departed from Beijing, the officials in the surrounding area were sparing no expense to search for newly caught carp to provide for the Empress Dowager's meals. When the train arrived in Fengtai, several freshly caught large carp were placed in very exquisite containers, and after a very corrupt etiquette, they were solemnly presented. But even though these officials were serving so carefully, the Empress Dowager seemed to be unaware of it. The reason is that the officials in the Fengtai area are all insignificant and nameless characters, not even qualified to meet the Empress Dowager! (110)</p>

<h3>Daming Lake in Jinan</h3>
<p>— (Zhurongshi)</p>
<p>Jinan is surrounded by mountains, forming a basin. Because of the mountains in the four suburbs, the springs inside and outside Jinan City are particularly numerous. The most famous, of course, are the Pearl Spring in the Provincial Government Office and the Baotu Spring in the city. In the Jinan area, there are a total of seventy-two springs. Moreover, no matter where it is, as long as it is in Jinan, you can get spring water by digging five feet, which can be considered the place with the most springs. Not only are there many springs, but due to the accumulation of water, it has also formed a Daming Lake, which has become a famous scenic spot in Jinan. Daming Lake is located half outside the city and half inside the city. The area is not vast, only dozens of acres in size, and the depth is only five or six feet. However, the water is as clear as the Baotu Pearl Spring. No matter who it is, when they arrive in Jinan, they must sit on a pleasure boat and wander in Daming Lake, which can eliminate the fatigue they have suffered along the way. Especially in summer, when the commercial port in Jinan City is hot to over a hundred degrees, as soon as you get to Daming Lake, the heat immediately disappears, and you can't bear to leave. In addition, the Longjing tea brewed with provincial lake water is sweet and refreshing, it is truly a joy to hold it in your hand, and you would never have thought that in the Jinan Prefecture, which is full of yellow sand, there is such a summer resort.</p>
<p>The strangest thing is that the pleasure boats in Daming Lake are not as exquisite as the painted boats on West Lake and Slender West Lake in the Qinhuai River. What surprises you the most is that there is no stern or main scull, as if it is only half of an ordinary boat, only the bow and the cabin. On top of the cabin, there is a white cloth canopy, with a rattan table and several rattan chairs. Above the bow, however, it is pitifully empty, only standing a tree branch that is more than a zhang long and looks like steel. This is the only pole used by the boatmen to row the boat. Those who have never toured Daming Lake, seeing this simple pleasure boat and strange tree branch, will have half of their interest in touring the lake taken away. But when you row into the middle of the lake, and carefully taste the Longjing tea brewed with lake water, you can forget about the world-famous painted boats on West Lake, let alone the Slender West Lake in Yangzhou and the Qinhuai River in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Zhan Bridge</h3>
<p>— (Tang Cheng Nian)</p>
<p>Walking along the seaside at the end of Zhongshan Road, there is a long bridge made of cement, like a long snake, that extends straight into the sea from the seaside. That is Qingdao's Zhan Bridge. Other bridges are all built in the middle of two banks, but this Zhan Bridge only connects to the shore on one side. In the past, the Germans only built a part of it, and the municipal government spent more than 600,000 yuan to complete it. On both sides of the bridge, there are iron chains and rows of long chairs. At the end of the bridge close to the shore, there is a small square of sandy land, with stone benches and stone platforms. Next to the sandy land, there is also a small square of lawn, planted with flowers, all for people to rest. The sea dyke along the bridge's stone surface is full of jagged rocks. The sea water crashes on the rocks, flying up white foam more than a zhang high; on the left is a flat sandy beach, the sea water rolling endlessly, making a snoring sound like a yellow cow. At the end of the bridge, a palace-style pavilion is built, with carved beams and painted rafters, and glittering gold. Above it hangs a horizontal plaque with the three characters "Hui Lan Ge" written by Mayor Shen Honglie. Standing on the bridge and gazing leisurely, one sees green water and a long sky, a vast expanse of blue. Under the fierce power of the scorching sun, a group of Qingdao residents below the middle class use this as a place to cool off and enjoy the summer. When the sun sets, many men and women, in groups, walk towards the bridge, creating a lively scene. What is most eye-catching is a group of barefoot, leg-exposing modern young ladies, as well as wooden clogs and Westerners, bustling in the crowd. There are also foreign warships moored at sea, and sailors sitting in their own speedboats, speeding back and forth like lightning. They all land here, and of course everyone struts with a full display of foreign arrogance. It is said that their monthly income of sixty yuan in gold is all spent on fine wine and women, not willing to leave a penny. Qingdao, in terms of geography, should have been a very important naval port in our north, but now it has become a scenic area. I feel endless emotion for this great land!</p>

<h3>Public Debt Plunge is Terrifying</h3>
<p>▲Maximum drop of two yuan and eight and a half jiao ▲Extremely active trading still doing two sessions Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Business Securities Exchange suddenly experienced a sharp drop, which was completely out of the ordinary. In comparison with the environmental situation, it seems inconsistent. Market rumors rose with the trend, and the general followers of the tide all came out of their nests. The financial community also sold out. The superficial reason is that the money supply is tightening, and a penny and a half of ocean interbank lending is inevitable. This greatly reduces the attractiveness of arbitrage trading with weak reserves. Other factors, such as the tense situation between Japan and Russia and the rampant bandits in Fujian Province, also contributed to the decline. The internal reason is actually the failure to implement the bank savings law. Both the bulls and bears competed with each other with wisdom and strength, resulting in this abnormal decline. At present, it is still necessary to see whether the bulls have a concrete plan. The future rise and fall cannot be determined in one word, but a large drop followed by a small rebound is expected. Yesterday, the daily four-session trading should have been restored, but the trading was extremely active, and the time was still not enough, so it was temporarily done in two sessions, and the closing was already at 5 pm. In the first session, the sellers immediately dumped, and the market price fell uniformly, first by a few jiao, and then more severely, with the largest drop being two yuan. In the second session, most people expected it to rebound slightly, but it was still forced by high pressure, and the drop was still huge, with the largest drop also being one yuan and seven or eight jiao. The severity of the decline was beyond expectations. However, those who knew the inside story expected that it would inevitably happen. As a result, the market price fell by several jiao to two yuan and eight and a half jiao. The total turnover was estimated to be about 30 million yuan. The results of the price rise and fall are listed in the comparison table below.

<p>The government has no intention of prohibiting the export of silver</p>
<h3>Gold Standard Drops Seven Yuan and Ten Cents</h3>
<p>Rumor of Banks Cooperating to Suppress the Exchange Rate Leads to a Mid-Session Crash. The Central Bank Aggressively Opens Spot Trading, Weak at First but then Stabilizes. Yesterday's gold market fell because of the government's lack of intention to increase silver taxes and the rumor that banks were suppressing exchange rates. Initially, due to the rise in the London silver market and the stability of the US market, London raw gold rose by half a penny, and exchange rates narrowed. US cotton fell by 16 points, US wheat rose by 2/125, and stocks fell slightly. The general public was greatly disappointed. In addition, news reported that our Minister of Finance announced that the government had no intention of banning silver or increasing taxes. Initial trading of raw materials was at 58 yuan. Reuters reported that the government in Nanjing confirmed there would be no increase in silver taxes or ban on silver exports. Gold businesses continued to decline in anticipation of trading. After opening, the domestic market hardened, and the upper market was still weak. It was predicted that HSBC's listing would remain stable for British currency and US currency would shrink by 1/125, which could still be maintained. However, buyers in the market were agile, and sellers still felt pressured. Major players took the opportunity to purchase, and the domestic market once tightened, causing a price surge. People were uneasy and broke through the 60-yuan mark. However, although the rise was fast, the fall was also rapid. Banks took advantage of the high prices to continue selling aggressively. Various groups in the market worked hard to sell gold bars, and arbitrageurs also provided supply. It retreated back within the 60-yuan range, but buyers were still unwilling to show weakness, and there was quite a bit of struggle at this time. Before long, banks repeatedly sold, and the domestic market remained loose. The Guangdong merchants' intention to sell was particularly strong, so they temporarily succumbed. However, public sentiment was still calm. Afterwards, there were still several rebounds, but they were in a revolving state, lacking influence on the overall situation. Ultimately, due to arbitrage convergence, the supply surged, and the afternoon close reported a decline. After the market closed, there were rumors from the banking sector that bankers in Lushan had decided to abandon the two strategies of banning silver exports and increasing silver taxes, and that banks were cooperating to suppress the exchange rate in Shanghai, hoping to equalize exchange rates. Selling pressure suddenly arose and the market crashed. Later, the domestic market became loose and excessive. In addition, Western banks were loading cash silver for export, which greatly affected public sentiment. There were also rumors that the Bank of China and HSBC were selling shillings and the Central Bank was supplying US dollars, with Chinese merchants limited to buying exchange bills to equalize exchange rates and prevent the outflow of cash silver. The market fell immediately after the open, but was sustained as banks bought at low prices. Bombay reported a drop of 2.2.2 annas. The Central Bank aggressively opened cash trading, and public sentiment gradually improved. Chinese merchants reversed course and the domestic market suddenly tightened. The market situation finally rebounded. The daily market situation is recorded below. The morning opening was 956.2 yuan, a decrease of 7.6 yuan compared to last Saturday. Commodity opening was 5.8 yuan. The exchange market opened with the recent selling price of British exchange at one shilling, four pence, four three seven five, and US exchange at 34.875 yuan. Qian Chang, Xiang Chun, Yuan Yong Qing, Yu Yuan Chang, Yong Zhao Feng Chang sold bars. The domestic market also hardened, and retreated to 5 yuan. It was predicted that HSBC's listing would be flat for British currency and US currency would shrink by 1/125. Market sentiment was still stable. Yuan Mao, Yong Fu Yu, Fu Xing, Yong Heng Xing Sheng, Da Yi Feng Yong, Fu An Yu Qing Yong, Da Chang Xiang Da Tian Feng Yong Heng Yu, and others showed strong buying interest. Public sentiment was quite excited and gradually rose, eventually rising to 61.5 yuan. At this time, the domestic market was also tense, boosting buying interest. Mercantile came out with October US dollars at 0.0625, and HSBC came out with November at 1.875. Dalian merchant Tian Feng Yu Qing Yong aggressively sold in the upper market, and arbitrageurs supplied bars one after another, immediately retreating to 58 yuan. Da Xing Yong Sen Chang Yong Heng Xing Yuan Yi Feng Yong aggressively purchased, rising to 9.6 yuan. Banks continued to sell. Yu Qing Yong Heng Xing Yi Cheng Da De Cheng Tian Feng Wan Xing successively sold to within 8 yuan. At this time, Yuan Sheng Yong Zhao Feng Chang entered and then exited, falling from 8.5 yuan to 7 yuan. Yong Feng Fu Xing Yong Yuan Sheng Yong Da Xing Yong re-entered to about 9 yuan. Banks aggressively sold September at 35 yuan. Dalian merchant Da De Cheng Fu Yu came to sell, falling to within 8 yuan. Although Yong Li Heng Yu Yi Feng Yong Qian Chang Xiang entered, Yuan Mao Yong Heng Xing Sheng Da Da De Cheng aggressively sold bars, still gradually falling to 7 yuan. Korea bought December US dollars at 3.75. Chase Manhattan sold September at 35 yuan. The situation was very stable. Later, because Yu Qing Yong Da De Cheng Qing Fa Yong Shun Mao, etc., showed some interest, it rose to 9.2 yuan. Chun Yuan Yong Zhao Feng Chang Da De Cheng Heng Xing Yuan Xing Shun Li Yuan Sheng Yong Yuan Heng Qing Fa Yong, etc., sold one after another. Buyers in the market gradually became exhausted, and the closing price fell to 955.3 yuan. Commodities were auctioned at 3.5 yuan. After the market closed, Qing Fa Yong Da De Cheng Fu Xing Shui Hong Li aggressively sold, retreating to within 3 yuan. The news was unfavorable. Finally, it rebounded slightly. The post-market opening retreated to 952.3 yuan. Commodities opened at the same price. Yuan Chang Chun Yuan Yong Yong Li Fu Xing Yong sold bars. The domestic market also hardened. Mitsui came out with November US dollars at 3.75, and fell to zero and nine cents. Yuan Pan Yong Zhao Feng Chang Rui Kang Fu An Qian Chang Xiang Hui Xiang Yi Cheng entered bars. Pan Gen ate November US dollars at 3.75. Bombay fell by two annas, rising to 3.9 yuan. Although Da De Cheng sold to 3 yuan, ultimately the Central Bank opened cash, Rui Kang Yu Qing Yong Fu An Yi Feng Yong Fu Tai Heng all entered, rising to 4.5 yuan. Although Fu Xing Yong came to sell bars, the decline was very slight. Rui Kang Fu Tai Heng Hong Xing Yi Yu all accepted, further rising to 5.5 yuan. Banque Belge sold October US dollars at 1.875, once falling to 4.5 yuan. Ultimately, Yi Feng Yong Da De Cheng Fu Xing Yong Yu Qing Yong De Kang all entered, rising to 7 yuan. Banque Belge came out with October US dollars at 0.0625. Da Fa Yong Yuan Chang Yong sold out, falling by one yuan. Public sentiment was very cheerful. De Kang continued to enter. Zheng Chang, etc., also bought. The closing price was 956.7 yuan. Commodities were auctioned at 6.5 yuan. After the market closed, Yuan Mao Yong, etc., all entered and gradually rose. Finally, it rose to about 8 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the day was 961.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 950.9 yuan, a difference of 10.06 yuan. As a result, it fell by 7.1 yuan compared to last Saturday's close. The closing price was due to HSBC's US exchange rate listing shrinking by 1/125 to 34.75 yuan, equivalent to a gold price of a strong 995 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 59 yuan lower, which was about 10 yuan more than last Saturday. The ledger entry for this month was 961 yuan, September was 957 yuan, October was 955 yuan, the morning supplement was 961 yuan, and the afternoon supplement was 963 yuan. The price of red gold was calculated at 968.2 yuan, about 12 yuan higher. Tianjin goods surged, so spot numbers were not very interested. In the front market, only merchants traded with each other, adding 13.5 yuan. In the post market, Ying Feng Heng sold 700 taels to Tianjin merchants, adding 15 yuan. Forward trading was also affected by spot prices. Because the gold price rose, the location was likely to have a source, and due to the Sabbath, Ying Feng Heng posted more than 200 bars at three corners. Hui Yuan posted 42 bars at three corners on behalf of commodities, which were posted by Fu Chang. Later, it was about one or two corners, lacking short positions. In the post market, the premium was stable due to the Central Bank's cash opening. Shun Li posted 49 bars at four corners to Shen Kang, 21 bars at six corners to Zhen Tai, and 21 bars at eight corners to Da De Cheng. The Central Bank opened and bought 1,260 spot bars at a price of 955 yuan, about 1 yuan higher than the futures market price. Fu Tai Heng and Rui Kang handled the purchases in the market. In addition, there were many Dalian merchants inter-transferring September bars, and Rui Yong Fu Chang, etc., transferred October bars to Dalian merchants frequently. Yesterday's public order release included Tong Yi 35 bars and Ding Chang 21 bars. The receipts included Fu Chang 49 bars and Shun Li 7 bars. The public orders released on the day included Tong Feng Heng 56 bars and Qian Chang Xiang 21 bars. The receipts included Fu Chang 63 bars and Shun Li 14 bars. Transactions in the market were more chaotic. In summary, Wan Xing Shun Li Heng Xing Sheng Da Yuan Heng Tian Feng Fu Yu Yuan Chun Shun Mao Yong Feng Tong Chun Hong Kang Shen Kang Yuan Chang Yong, etc., were on the selling side. Yuan Mao Yong Da De Cheng Sen Chang Yong Da Chang Xiang Hui Yuan Yu Qing Yong Fu Tai Heng Qing Fa Yong Yi Feng Yong Hui Xiang Xiang He Da Fa Yong Rui Kang Yi Cheng Fu Xing Yong Tong Tai Chang De Kang Fu An, etc., were on the buying side. Yong Li Heng Yu Yu Qing Yong Fu Xing Yong entered first and then exited. Ding Tai Fu An Zhao Feng Chang Qian Chang Xiang exited first and then entered. Dalian merchants Wan Xing jointly did more than 3,000 bars, canceling out about 1,000. Shun Li jointly did more than 3,400 bars, canceling out more than 300.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Returns to Looseness and Excess</h3>
<p>Previously, according to overseas telegrams, London large bars recently rose 0.0625, and long-term rose 1.25. US banks remained flat. London raw gold rose half a penny. British currency to US currency shrank 3.75. US currency to British currency shrank one point. British currency to French currency did not move. US currency to French currency shrank one point. Private telegram exchange rates shrank half a point and stagnated. Yesterday's exchange market opened with the recent selling price of British exchange at one shilling, four pence, four three seven five, and US exchange at 34.875 yuan. Compared to last Saturday, British currency loosened 1/125 and US currency became cheaper 1/875. This was because our Minister of Finance definitively denied any silver ban policy. After the opening, the banks' intention to sell was agile and hardened. However, because HSBC's listing was announced, British currency was flat and US currency shrank 1/125, and Chinese merchants bought aggressively, once turning around. However, lacking persistence, the banks soon repeated sales of recent issues, and the market situation loosened again. The final transaction was sparse, lacking change. In the post-market, the banking sector revealed information that the two strategies of prohibition and taxation would not be adopted for the silver problem, and public sentiment was greatly deflated. The upper market was very hard. Banks came to buy at low prices. Bombay fell two annas. The Central Bank opened cash, exciting people. Chinese merchants reversed course, and the process gradually tightened.

<h3>Foreign Interbank Rate Opens at Ten Cents Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the concentration of cash in cities caused inflation, it has been a year without any vitality. Yesterday's foreign interbank rate, although only two points higher than the previous day, opened at ten cents in both the morning and afternoon markets. The Small General Association even had a transaction of fifteen cents in the afternoon, with a six-point head-cutting premium. However, this kind of market has been rare in the past year.

<h3>The Yarn Market Presents a Hesitant and Uneven State</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, and the situation appears slightly softened. However, the current sales of yarn are still maintaining, and merchants have interest. The large amounts of money from the money shops have not been completely abandoned, and there are still some who want to take delivery, so the market is moving back and forth only slightly.</p>
<h3>The Near Months of Standard Yarn are Soft, the Distant Months are Firm</h3>
<p>The Standard Yarn pre-market opening was slightly soft due to the continued decline of US cotton, and there were not many buyers in the market. All months fell by 3-4 corners, and prices were auctioned down to 2-3 trays. When cotton prices turned up and there was good news on yarn sales to customers, floating shorts acted to cover their positions, and the market suddenly rebounded. As a result, the near months were flat and the distant months rose 1.2-3 corners. The afternoon opening was still flat, and when prices were auctioned down to 2-3 trays, they were slightly soft. Some bulls closed out their positions, and the market atmosphere loosened slightly. As a result, the near months fell 1.3-4 corners, and the distant months were flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 29,200 bales. The following are the statistics for selling: Yuan Yi 1,200 bales, Heng Chang 1,750 bales, He Xing 700 bales, Shen Chang 650 bales, Tai Xing 1,750 bales, Ming De 1,350 bales, Da Feng 700 bales, Tong Ji 850 bales, Chang Yu 800 bales, Ren Feng 550 bales.

<h3>Customer Sales of Spot Yarn are Good</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. The statistics of the total number of bales bought by each merchant group for the day is 1,265 bales. Market sentiment is firm. The purchase amount of each merchant group is as follows: Guangdong 180, Sichuan 300, Ningbo 6, Wenzhou 90, Yunnan 40, Mainland 155, Northern Merchants 15, Shantou 2, Nanjing 7, Same Trade 80, Jiangxi 45, Xuzhou 30, Tianjin 225.</p>
<h3>Short Positions in Standard Cotton Cover Their Losses</h3>
<p>The cotton market is still flat, but market sentiment has become tense. Because a certain cotton company took profits and covered its shorts, the market suddenly turned firm. At the same time, there was also news that domestic cotton production is estimated to have increased slightly compared to last year, which caused market sentiment to turn good again. Factories are still purchasing new cotton from time to time, but large short positions are still quiet. Short positions currently account for the majority of the market.</p>
<h3>The Overall Trend of Standard Cotton is Stable</h3>
<p>The Standard Cotton pre-market opening was weak due to poor US cotton, and the market showed signs of decline again. Selling pressure was slightly stronger, and prices continued to fall for two trays. October and November both broke the five-yuan mark. Suddenly, the price rebounded sharply in the third tray, and the wind turned suddenly tight. This was actually because a certain cotton company made a profit and covered its short positions. The market dried up at the close, and the price increase was even more激烈. Each month rebounded 3-4 corners from the low. As a result, each month rose 1.5-2.3 corners. The afternoon opening was weak again, because the new cotton opening price was 5 corners lower. However, the estimated cotton production in the third tray was released, which was not conducive to short positions, and the price rebounded again. As a result, each month fell 1-2 corners compared to the opening price. The total transaction volume for the day was 102,400 dan. The following are the statistics for selling: Ming De 1,400 dan, Da Feng 1,600 dan, Tong Ji 1,600 dan, Yuan Da 1,600 dan, Jin Chang 4,400 dan, Tai Xing 1,300 dan, Hui Kang 1,400 dan, Chang Feng 6,200 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 1,700 dan, Chang He 2,600 dan, Shen Ji 1,400 dan, Xie Sheng 2,600 dan, Tong He 3,100 dan.

Tomorrow, 300-400 bales of new Yao cotton will arrive in Shanghai, with the opening price generally said to be around 33-34 yuan per dan in the market. Huo Ji cotton is 38.50. Heng Feng Factory enters 1,000 bales. September-October delivery to the factory Dong Gou cotton is 39.25. Yong An Factory enters 300 bales. Two weeks and twenty-three years.</p>
<h3>First Estimated Report on National Cotton Production</h3>
<p>The China Cotton Industry Statistics Association announced the first estimate of national cotton production in the twenty-third year at 5:00 PM on August 20, 1934 as follows: Cotton Field Area 4,444,1047 mu Raw Cotton Production 10,497,924 dan The above estimate (1) is based on reports compiled from eleven provinces including Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, as well as the two cities of Shanghai and Tianjin. (2) The conditions of cotton crops before August 15 are used as a reference. (3) The losses caused by disasters suffered by cotton crops in each province before August 15 have been included in the calculation. (4) The cotton field is measured in mu, and the cotton production is measured in dan (100 jin per dan). The first estimate of this year by the association is compared with the estimated numbers of cotton field production in the recent two years below: Cotton Field Area (mu) Raw Cotton Production (dan) Year 15 27,549,727 6,245,585 Year 16 27,610,276 6,722,108 Year 17 31,926,311 8,839,274 Year 18 33,811,255 7,587,021 Year 19 37,593,012 8,809,567 Year 20 31,637,779 6,599,780 Year 21 37,099,800 8,105,637 Year 22 40,454,023 9,774,207 The first time in Year 23 44,441,047 10,497,824 (To be continued Estimation of food</p>
<p>Rumors of Selling Foreign Wheat Flour are Again Prevailing</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline Seen in Post-Flour and Wheat Market</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market this morning, prices for various months rose and then fell. Foreign wheat was quoted at about 24 cents higher in Chicago and about 4 cents higher in Canada. When prices opened, with foreign wheat showing a gain, the market sentiment and speculative buyers outside the industry were very positive. Near-term and long-term contracts rose by about 2 to 3 cents compared to last week's closing prices. However, below the second round of bidding, factories began selling off this month's contracts, and some Tianjin traders also returned to selling long-term contracts, causing the bullish momentum to falter. Prices weakened immediately after the opening, falling about 1 to 2 cents from the initial prices. In the afternoon, the decline intensified, with rumors circulating of active selling of spot foreign wheat. It was said that No. 2 wheat from New Orleans was quoted at $5.55. Although there were no actual transactions yet, this benchmark price created uncertainty among industry insiders and outsiders, which is common in speculative markets. In addition, factories were selling small amounts of both near-term and long-term contracts, and northern bulls were also continuing to liquidate. Buyers were mostly from outside the industry and had weaker financial power, so prices fell sharply and continuously. By the close, prices for August, September, and October contracts had all fallen below the 60-cent mark. The force of the reversal was difficult for buyers to handle. As a result, the current month fell 4.5 cents, September fell 4.5 cents, October fell 4.75 cents, November-December fell 2.75 cents, and January fell 2 cents.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market this morning, prices for various months showed positive signs. Foreign wheat was quoted at about 24 cents higher in Chicago and about 4 cents higher in Canada. Therefore, the market atmosphere was quite brisk at the opening. Since prices in the producing areas had not softened, most of the spot wheat in this port was in the hands of traders, leading to speculative hoarding. As a result, although trading volume was not high, market prices rose by 7 to 8 cents to over 10 cents compared to the previous week. However, traders from the interior had reduced activity, as most had suffered losses at the peak. In the afternoon, the market suddenly reversed, with near-term and long-term opening prices falling by as much as about 10 cents compared to the morning. The rumors of foreign wheat being sold off were spreading rapidly in the market, and the weakness of the flour market also contributed to the decline, causing significant uncertainty and a sharp reversal. As a result, the current month was up 1 cent, September was down 2 cents, October was down 6 cents, November was down 1 cent, and December was down 2 cents. The spot wheat market remained sluggish, with factories showing no eagerness to buy. Only Fuxin engaged in routine transactions, offering 5 cents higher for high-quality wheat. Shandong Xuzhou Linhuai Wuhe wheat was quoted at $4.05, Qingjiang Mingguang wheat at $4.02-3, Yangzhou wheat at $3.93, Gaoyou wheat at $3.96, and Zhenjiang wheat at $3.85, totaling 30,000 bags, which were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>New Mung Beans from Bengbu Enter the Market</h3>
<p>- Hoarders Buying Soybeans, Bullish Trend Intensifies -</p>
<p>Yesterday, ten bags of large-sized mung beans from Bengbu arrived. This year's produce is superior to previous years, with fewer dry and shriveled beans. They were handled by Guangdong traders and priced at $5. The new mung beans from Xinpu and Xinmao that arrived last Saturday were not favored because they contained some bright beans and remained unsold. Yesterday, the bullish trend for new and old soybeans revived, with old beans up 20 cents compared to last week, and new beans up over 10 cents. The price of old beans rose rapidly due to strong buying by hoarders, while new beans experienced steady sales and were boosted by the bullish trend of old beans, leading to a firmer market. A total of 18 to 19 truckloads of various beans were traded in the open market, including over 2,000 bags of new beans.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cake Market Booming</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was continued demand for edged oilseed cake from Shahe. Traders' inventories were depleted, and supply was not catching up, leading to a booming market. Prices rose another 4 cents compared to last Saturday, with over 2,800 pieces traded. Prices opened at $1.365 and $1.38. Soybean oil did not open when peanut oil prices dropped. Yesterday, the market was nervous due to news of flooding in Andong. A total of 500 cases of Niuzhuang oil from steamers were traded at $12.40, 100 cases of Shahe boat cargo at $12.50, and 50 cases of Qiyi oil from sand boats at $16.15. For peanut oil, 100 cases of light-skinned oil, 300 cases of mixed-storage oil, and 50 cases of Boyier oil were traded, with prices increasing by 20 cents across the board.</p>
<h3>New Orchid Seeds from the North and South Continued to Arrive Yesterday</h3>
<p>The supply of new orchid seeds is limited this year, so market prices are stable and unlikely to fall significantly. There have been no new supplies for two weeks, and inventories are gradually depleting. Forty more boxes arrived yesterday via Jinan steamer and will be available for sampling today.</p>

<h3>On Spoil Sports</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhe</p>
<p>No matter who it is, everyone feels indignant and unhappy when they encounter a spoil sport, hear a remark that spoils the fun, or see behavior that spoils the fun. Indeed, being a spoil sport is not considered a good thing in most people's eyes; if it were a good thing, would it be universally detested?</p>
<p>The negative impression given by being a spoil sport is that it dampens people's spirits. For example, if a person is surrounded by friends, engaging in lively discussions, and enjoying themselves, and suddenly someone tells them that a family member has died, that would be a major instance of spoiling the fun. Or, if a passionate couple is enjoying a romantic rendezvous in a hotel, and suddenly several people barge in to commit adultery, that would also be a major instance of spoiling the fun. Furthermore, if two village women from different families are engaged in a day-long shouting match, thoroughly enjoying themselves, and suddenly someone claiming to be Lu Zhonglian intervenes to mediate, that would also be spoiling the fun. Such instances of spoiling the fun ruin people's good time, like a bucket of cold water poured over their heads, leaving them unsure whether to laugh or cry. How can one expect not to provoke resentment in such situations?</p>
<p>Since spoiling the fun is known for dampening people's spirits, those who engage in such behavior inevitably offend others to some extent; this cannot be denied. However, some people believe that those who spoil the fun initially harbor malicious intentions to harm others, thus leading to their offensive behavior. This issue is worth discussing. In reality, whether spoiling the fun offends others depends on the specific situation and does not necessarily require malicious intent. For example, when Liu Jiwen was the mayor of Nanjing, Mr. Ma Er built a thatched hut near Liu's magnificent Western-style building and lived there, which was clearly a malicious act of spoiling the fun! Similarly, recently, a dancer with the surname "Mou" at a certain dance hall released a small blue-and-white snake into the dance floor to cause trouble. This was also a spoil sport with malicious intent. However, when Dr. Liu Fu forbade the use of "Miss" to refer to unmarried women and replaced it with "Girl," this act of spoiling the fun, although not malicious, was still offensive. Furthermore, the recent advocacy for classical Chinese by those who dislike the current literary style is also a well-intentioned act of spoiling the fun that ultimately offends others. Thus, we can see that spoiling the fun with malicious intent is offensive, but spoiling the fun with good intentions can also be offensive.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it is done with malicious or good intentions, those who engage in spoiling the fun are undoubtedly idle and have nothing better to do. Because they are well-fed and have nothing to occupy their minds, they cannot help but interfere in others' affairs and offer unwelcome remarks, using this to amuse themselves. As a result, instances of spoiling the fun are as numerous as hairs on an ox. Therefore, people often curse those who spoil the fun, angrily saying, "Those busybodies can use anything as a form of entertainment, but why do they choose to spoil the fun? They are truly cursed!" However, they have not carefully considered that if there were no instances of spoiling the fun in the world, life would be incredibly dull, which would be a much greater act of spoiling the fun!</p>
<p>In conclusion, spoiling the fun is detestable, but having nothing to spoil is also pitiful. Therefore, I would rather encourage the busybodies of the world to defy criticism and spoil all the fun in the world.</p>
<h3>Bird Protection Movement</h3>
<p>— OH</p>
<p>(Bird Protection) is indeed a pleasant term, and as someone said earlier, human nature is inherently good. Therefore, with regard to (Bird Protection), since birds are living beings, we should, from the perspective of human nature, oppose the killing of living beings!</p>
<p>However, this is just one side of the argument. From the opposite perspective, this argument can be overturned. Biology has a concept called the "struggle for existence." Humans are the most adept at (competition), and this (competition) is necessary. If humans do not kill birds, the bird population will increase day by day. If it reaches a certain point, wouldn't the world become a world of birds?</p>
<p>These are two opposing arguments, and each has its supporters. The latter may not have a strong foundation, but the former is not entirely correct either. If we broaden our perspective slightly, what kind of world is this? To be honest, it can simply be described as a world of annexation. Isn't there constant conflict and competition between humans and animals? Even among humans, there is an irreconcilable and relentless annexation.</p>
<p>Originally, this world is quite peculiar. Some things are simply incomprehensible. (Murder) is disliked by humans, yet they create all kinds of mass-killing machines, as if there are too many people and they need to kill some off. Therefore, batches of murder kings (manufacturers of various killing machines) arise. Instead of banning them, governments actively promote them, with the sole purpose of killing more people!</p>
<p>Furthermore, although some people advocate (Bird Protection) and others agree, no one proposes (banning murder). What is the reason for this? As Shanghainese say, it's just "playing around"! Who can deny that humans wear (masks)? One moment they are displaying hearts of iron, and the next moment they become compassionate people! As the saying goes, (Those who do good deeds are not necessarily good people)! Who knows from what dark path their money for doing good deeds comes from! But humans are always clever. If they don't understand the (art of being human), they will have wasted their life as (humans)! Therefore, the core and stomach are one issue, while the façade must be attractive. Only such deformed (not physically deformed) individuals can exist in society today. Thus, it is easy to encounter such individuals everywhere!</p>
<p>Furthermore, because birds have life and are living beings, some people protect them. But other living beings also have life, so how can we bear to slaughter them? But there's only so much you can do, because humans simply have a peculiar mindset (I don't have a proper term to describe it). Anyway, the (Bird Protection Movement) is just a fun activity! If you actually ask them to state the reason for (only protecting birds and not others), they themselves won't know why. If you further ask why they don't protect people, they can only stare blankly and answer, "Do people need me to protect them? Can't they protect themselves? Why should I protect them?"</p>
<p>What reasons are there to say? Saying it is just like the wind blowing by. If you really want to talk about principles seriously, then, (Humph! This world is not a world that speaks of reason)?</p>
<h3>Random Notes by the Sickbed, Part Two</h3>
<p>— Black Tea</p>
<p>All diseases are ugly, except for pulmonary tuberculosis, which is a beautiful disease. I won't even mention the many young people who cough up blood for love, etc., but pulmonary tuberculosis itself is very beautiful.</p>
<p>First, pulmonary tuberculosis can make people lose weight, but unlike other acute illnesses, it doesn't make you look too emaciated. The ugliest thing in the world is being fat. Fat people give the feeling of being greasy and annoying. However, people with pulmonary tuberculosis will definitely not be fat. Naturally, athletes with strong muscles, handsome young men with well-proportioned bodies are more beautiful than pale patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, but if you don't get pulmonary tuberculosis, how do you know you won't get fat? You can be thankful that you have certainly avoided getting fat because you have pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Second, pulmonary tuberculosis comes with a feverish flush. When the flush comes, both cheeks turn red because of the fever. This not only completely conceals the paleness but also appears very springlike. This red is more delicate than yellow rouge and more elegant than red rouge. No wonder one type of pulmonary tuberculosis is called beauty's disease. Of course, this red is not long-lasting, but it is precisely the things that are not long-lasting that make people miss them. Isn't a sunset glow in the setting sun and a tree of withered flowers in late spring also not long-lasting?</p>
<p>Third, pulmonary tuberculosis is probably connected to coughing up blood, and coughing up blood is most beautiful with pulmonary tuberculosis! The blood streaks are like the red threads that daughters have carefully split, and the blood spots are like the wildflowers in the spring field. If you have a mouthful of blood, then it's like the red velvet gnawed by an ancient beauty.</p>
<p>Fourth, people with pulmonary tuberculosis will definitely suffer from insomnia, and insomnia is very beautiful. Everyone admits that the night is more beautiful than the day. At that time, countless graceful stars blink charmingly. If it is the third or fourth day of the lunar month, that crescent moon will remind you of the eyebrows of a (good friend). In the deep and quiet night, you carefully gaze because of insomnia. At this time, even if you don't have a lover, you feel that there is a beauty somewhere in the sky. I have never liked Ding'an's poems, but his (Looking up, I see the buildings clearly outside, A graceful spring star or it is you) can make me nod and smile. How can those who don't suffer from insomnia enjoy all of this? Wang Zhongze, for a woman's sake, accidentally had insomnia and still made such a good poem (These stars are not those of last night, For whom do I stand in the wind and dew in the middle of the night). People with pulmonary tuberculosis who suffer from insomnia, although they may not necessarily write poetry, the scenery in their poems is always personally experienced.</p>
<p>Fifth, people with pulmonary tuberculosis sometimes think about death. Because they think about death, they will think about life as well. Over time, this will prevent them from being superficial. There are plenty of people in the world who cannot understand the meaning of life at all and live and act aimlessly. There is a very good descriptive term for these people: (walking corpses). They are busy their whole lives without ever knowing why; these are the so-called (living in a drunken dream). The ancients considered (rotting with the grass and trees) (dying without a name) to be the most pitiful, but I consider those people who are busy their whole lives without ever knowing why to be the most pitiful. Having pulmonary tuberculosis can avoid this. If you avoid this, what's there to regret even in death, especially since you might not die?</p>
<p>In short, pulmonary tuberculosis is a beautiful disease. It is not only beautiful but also a disease of literature and philosophy. Naturally, this is just one person's personal opinion.</p>
<h3>Why Is Shanghai Worth Lingering Over?</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>Shanghai is an attractive place. Everyone who hasn't been to Shanghai, whether they are in bustling cities like Tianjin or Guangzhou and are doing quite well, is always eagerly hoping to come to Shanghai. As for those who live in cities or even rural areas, needless to say, their fervent desire is even greater. Naturally, I am one of those who came: I don't know why, but from a very young age, I dreamed of coming to Shanghai. At that time, a family member was running a school in Shanghai. My father knew him slightly, and I repeatedly begged my father to write to him to bring me to Shanghai to study. My father always said that I was too young and would talk about it when I was older. When I grew up, my father not only forbade me from coming to Shanghai but also wanted me to drop out of school. I didn't obey him and, at great risk, left my warm home on a snowy winter morning and escaped to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shanghai, I have arrived! Shanghai is indeed as perfect as I dreamed! Until I had been in Shanghai for a full five years, I was still in love with it.</p>
<p>However, in the last three years, I have begun to feel disgusted.</p>
<p>There is a clue to be found here: Why was I so in love before? And why have I become disgusted now? There is a big reason for this. The reason why I was in love with Shanghai before was that I hadn't truly arrived in Shanghai. In other words, I was just watching the fire from across the river, only circling around the outer shell of Shanghai. I had never personally experienced the true face of Shanghai. That is because I had spent the previous five years confined to a school that was isolated from society. Now that I see through it, Shanghai is actually this kind of place.</p>
<p>If I were the son of a wealthy family, then Shanghai wouldn't be so difficult for me to get along with. Even if I were just born with a talent for flattery, even if I were empty-handed and had nothing else, I could still strategize, attract wealth, and create a situation for myself. I could still be impressive in Shanghai. Even if I only won an aviation lottery once, that would be a solution. Shanghai is this kind of Shanghai. It is only a place for the rich to spend money, and the poor can never settle down. I, alas, have a poor fate, having been born poor; and I have no luck with various remedies such as getting rich or winning the lottery. Naturally, I can only roll away. Shanghai is simply not a place for me to settle down.</p>
<p>Secondly, if I could be shameless and do anything, there would still be a way. There are many people of this kind in Shanghai. They all carry a mouth on their shoulders and can easily eat and excrete every day. Sometimes, a gust of wind comes, and they rise even higher and become arrogantly powerful. Life is no problem for them. Examples of this kind of person are hooligans and loafers. But I am so unlucky; and I am inherently disgusted by these people. Of course, this path is also impassable.</p>
<p>Shanghai is this kind of Shanghai, and I am this kind of me. Naturally, there is only one way to leave. However, for some reason, putting it into practice is so difficult. Speaking of which, there have been several opportunities in the past when friends invited me to go to other cities, but I always managed to decline. Naturally, I still had some lingering feelings for Shanghai at that time, even though the awkwardness was even greater than it is now.</p>
<p>Now, in my eyes, Shanghai only has places to be disgusted with and no places to be fond of or praised. But I am distressed that I don't have a chance to leave quickly. But I think I will be able to leave in the near future.</p>
<h3>Reading the Third Issue of the Social Monthly</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>This year, people are saying it's the year of magazines. If we were to take a census of the various literary and non-literary publications that have been published successively in the publishing market during this year, the number would be truly impressive. Saying it's the year of magazines doesn't seem exaggerated.</p>
<p>However, in general, many magazines suffer from a common problem in terms of their format and content. Either they are too biased towards one aspect and appear strangely monotonous, or they are too specialized. Naturally, the editors have their own fixed ideas, but if we consider the psychology and interests of a wide readership, it is not clear whether they meet the requirements. I believe that the most important thing for a magazine to be unique and innovative is to expand the scope of its content as much as possible, but not in a scattered way. Instead, the magazine should be created in a systematic and organized manner to have a multi-faceted appearance.</p>
<p>The Social Monthly, which has recently published two issues, stands out from the many publications that exist today in terms of its format and content. It appropriately meets the requirements of a new type of magazine. It is commendable that it is presented to readers in a new posture.</p>
<p>The third issue was published today. It also includes a special collection on the mass language problem. Other creations are also richer and more lively than before.</p>
<p>There is one more thing I want to say, which is the magazine's characteristic. It doesn't publish long articles. All of them are short and concise articles that are not of low taste.</p>
<p>However, there are too many shortcomings. The lineup is a bit scattered. It would be better if it were more organized. Even the cover illustrations are too vulgar. In short, these are all areas for improvement. I hope the editors will put in the effort, strive for excellence, and create a new era for the magazine year.</p>

<h3>A Major Event in Wujia Town</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>The Fu family is as bustling today as it was when their eldest son got married. The dark, grand front gate is wide open, and servants are busy preparing tea and handing out sedan chair money. Every relative who arrives is dressed impeccably, as if attending a banquet. Everything is just like it was during the Fu family's eldest son's wedding. However, the neighbors are peering and craning their necks, wondering what's going on. When the Fu family had happy events, they would dress in their finest clothes, which they rarely wore, to offer congratulations and have a drink. From this, one can tell that the Fu family's grand display today is not for any celebratory occasion. Because whenever the family held weddings, funerals, or celebrations, they always welcomed anyone from the town to participate, as they loved a spectacle. Moreover, everyone within a radius of dozens of miles knew him to be a good man. Therefore, even townspeople who had only met him once would set aside important matters to attend any events in his family.</p>
<p>It's been three months since his son's wedding, and the weather is gradually getting warmer. The faint sound of cicadas carries from afar. The sedan chair carriers are waving their bamboo hats and sitting under the big trees, equally curious about the Fu family's gathering today, whispering and speculating among themselves. Finally, the clan elder, Grandpa Wu, arrives in his sedan chair. He is the busiest person in Wujia Town, wielding the power of a minor county official. Farmers' land disputes, encroachments on neighbors' eaves, and even borrowers without collateral can be settled peacefully with just a word from Grandpa Wu.</p>
<p>Although Wujia Town isn't a large township, Grandpa Wu is often nowhere to be found within a radius of dozens of miles, simply because he is so busy. Furthermore, his family has a long history of scholarship, and the town of Wujia gets its name from this. Later, neighboring towns mistakenly assumed it was the smallest of the Seven Towns, and everyone called it Wujia Town.</p>
<p>Now, with the weather so hot, for Grandpa Wu to come to the Fu family's house must mean something rare has occurred. When Fu Gonggong's eldest son, Fusheng, got married, he only stayed for a brief visit. So, when Grandpa Wu, fanning himself with a goose feather fan, stepped through the dark, grand front gate, many people surrounded his sedan chair carriers to inquire about the day's events. The carriers shook their heads, offering no answer, and sat down in the shade of the trees, waving their straw hats.</p>
<p>These many neighbors, eager to pry into idle gossip, gained no information and turned back to try to peer again, the two dark gates were once more tightly shut as usual. The secret finally swirled within their widened pupils.</p>

<h3>Lineup of New American Films for Next Year</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiong</p>
<p>Total National Production Exceeds Four Hundred Films - Musical Films Reach as Many as Thirty-Four</p>
<p>Every year during the cool autumn season, American film producers begin preparing for next year's productions, which they call the year's films. The annual plan is then implemented according to the production policy announced in the fall. Around June and July, larger American film companies like MGM, Paramount, Warner Bros., and Fox each select a suitable area to gather all their production and distribution personnel to discuss next year's productions. Now, the major annual conferences of the film companies have successively concluded, and the titles of next year's productions have largely been decided.</p>
<p>The total American production for 1934-35 will be thirty films more than those released from last year to this spring. The company with the largest increase in films is United Artists, because it includes the productions of Twentieth Century Pictures, increasing from twelve to twenty-four films per year. Furthermore, United Artists also serves as the distributor for British London Film Productions (the producer of "The Private Life of Henry VIII" and "The Scarlet Empress"). This is Britain's greatest film company, and now it has entrusted United Artists to handle distribution, so United Artists' film strength has been greatly enhanced. Producer Samuel Goldwyn's productions for next year include three films, two starring Soviet actress Anna Sten, and one musical starring Eddie Cantor, all of which will be distributed by United Artists.</p>
<p>Western-themed films will likely disappear from this year's American productions. This is due to the trend of the times. Westerns lack a significant audience, even within the United States, so to save on productions that generate less revenue, the companies have abandoned this type of film. However, Universal and Columbia, which have historically focused on producing Westerns, still plan to continue producing a few to meet market demand.</p>
<p>Currently, film companies are focusing on musical films. It is estimated that the total number of new American films next year will be over four hundred, covering various themes, with musicals being particularly prevalent, accounting for as many as thirty-four. Next are historical costume dramas, comedies, etc., while films depicting assassinations, detectives, and the lower class account for a very small number. Action films with themes such as horse racing, football, and boat racing have also decreased. Films exposing various aspects of society are also quite noteworthy, and films with grand scenes continue to increase.</p>
<p>Paramount's sixty-four feature films are the most among all film companies' productions for next year. The titles of forty-nine of them have already been decided. Next is Warner Bros., with a total of sixty films, forty-seven of which have been decided to be produced. Fox will release a total of fifty-eight films, with forty-nine currently determined. MGM has announced fifty-two films, but the plan is still subject to change and no formal announcement has been made. RKO has scheduled thirty-three out of fifty films, while Universal has forty-two films. Columbia has forty-eight films, and United Artists has twenty-four.</p>
<p>Due to the popularity of musical films, companies are allocating a significant amount of time to producing these types of films. Fox has eleven musicals, accounting for the majority. Warner Bros. and RKO each have five; Paramount and Universal each have four; MGM has three; and United Artists has two, one of which is a Samuel Goldwyn production starring Eddie Cantor.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Doctor Monica"</h3>
<p>— Xun Zhi</p>
<p>The Love Captive - Shown in Nanjing</p>
<p>The original author, director, and producer undoubtedly intended to cater to the audience's curiosity. However, after watching this film, it is clear that this attempt was unsuccessful. We can hardly blame the original author and director, who are not very familiar with Marcin, but the producer, Carl Laemmle, makes us doubt his vision and (business acumen).</p>
<p>The story's bizarreness and absurdity, its lack of plausibility, and its suggestion of (harming good customs and morals) mean that if this film's story and performances were produced by a Chinese film company, it would likely be banned. (Fortunately,) it is a product of an American company.</p>
<p>Like all Chinese and foreign supernatural films, closely examining its consciousness and intentions is unnecessary for sensible viewers. It simply tells a love story based on so-called hypnotism, with no basis in reality. It suggests to people who are tired of ordinary sex lives that there is a (love technique) that can be manipulated by magic, in addition to everything they have already experienced. Therefore, in the end, although the (divine doctor) is shot by his rival and the failure of this (technique) is announced, in their hearts, many noble and idle people probably favor such (techniques). Such a story has already predetermined everything, just like old Chinese supernatural novels. There is no need for any strict, logical structure. Anyway, it has been arranged in advance that (this technique is extremely miraculous, and if the practitioner does not die, it is difficult for others to break it).</p>
<p>The director simply explains this story in an ordinary way, without tension or climax. Of course, the mysteriousness and sensationalism of hypnotism, which serves as the central backbone, cannot dominate the audience's emotions as much as it is advertised. If you want to see the (mysterious surgery) (used for hunting beauty and seeking pleasure) in this film, you will definitely be disappointed.</p>
<h3>Struggles Between Big Stars</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>On the stage of Hollywood silver stars, countless silver stars shimmer. Under the pressure of many stars, struggles are inevitable. This kind of struggle is extraordinary because the female stars are in an absolutely active position, and outsiders have no right to participate. There is a confrontation between sex and flesh, and a struggle between personality and art. Everything is extraordinary, and big stars are the backbone of it all.</p>
<p>The struggle between Garbo and Marlene Dietrich has disappeared invisibly. Their styles have their own strengths, and the territories they occupy are different. In terms of art, there is no way to compare them at all, and it is impossible to judge who wins or loses. The result of the struggle has increased the value of both of them, and their reputations have spread widely. In short, this was a false struggle.</p>
<p>Successors include two triangular confrontation situations. That is, Garbo, Katharine Hepburn, and Constance Bennett. This is a group of spiritual and artistic competition. Garbo uses her personality to maintain her queen's throne, and Hepburn uses her art to maintain her reputation. Bennett is in a less important position.</p>
<p>Another group of triangular competition is Mae West, Marlene Dietrich, and Anna Sten. Mae's curvaceous beauty, Marlene's vivid beauty, and Anna's lips are all considered the center of beauty. Anna Sten is a new star in the film industry, and her rapid progress in art is truly amazing. Although Marlene and Mae have charming and moving postures, they cannot compete with Anna, so that the positions of Mae and Marlene have become dangerous. Anna has a kind of sympathy that surpasses all sexual temptation, and her delicate skin is unmatched by any female star in Hollywood. In addition, all parts of her body conform to the lines of beauty in the minds of modern aesthetes.</p>
<p>As for the ages of the three, Mae is the oldest, Marlene is the next oldest, and Anna is the youngest. The styles of the three, Mae is good at performing flirtatious and debauched, and Marlene and Anna are good at playing tragic roles. Their nationalities are different, Mae is American, Marlene is German, and Anna is Russian. Invisibly, this can also be regarded as international competition, but art does not distinguish between borders. The tones of the three's languages also have similar places, but they can't get rid of their respective local accents. They all have a kind of hot magic that makes people fall in love.</p>
<p>The competition between stars cannot stop, and the future results cannot be predicted. From the standpoint of film, art is above everything else. Other aspects such as sex and flesh can only be regarded as time-limited competition, and there is a risk of decline in the future. Only art can maintain permanence.</p>
<h3>Bing Crosby is Leaving</h3>
<p>— Shu Wen</p>
<p>Bing has clearly achieved great success in recent years. His natural singing voice and lively movements have left a deep impression on the audience. Indeed, we cannot say that it was a fluke that Bing became popular like a thunderclap. But the shocking news came that he was about to leave Hollywood. How unfortunate is this for the audience? Originally, at a time when he was thriving, how could he despise his screen career? Then let's see what reasons he gave:</p>
<p>(I'll shoot at most one more film), he said: (I'm leaving anyway, I'm prepared to continue to live a leisurely life in California. I am very sufficient. I'm not an ungrateful person, I want to live very simply!)</p>
<p>(The most stupid thing I've ever thought of in my life is to seek the approval of others, but this is what most people in Hollywood want to do the most, and I can't do it anyway!)</p>
<p>(I don't have any disagreements with Hollywood, and I don't despise the life of the screen, but I can't deceive myself. People say that I am a big star, but I can only sing, so why should I force myself to continue and increase my pain.)</p>
<p>(I am not a person who is afraid of difficulties, and I don't want to not work in the future, but I want to take happiness as a prerequisite. In this way, I would like to continue my radio singing career, not because it can increase my monetary income. In fact, I can't separate from it. If I get to the point where I can't sing, I would also like to work at a radio station, or write a book about radio singing.)</p>
<p>Bing is really determined to leave Hollywood. This is not a whim, but it has been going on for more than two years. Of course, he had to do this for the sake of his personal future happiness and joy, but the film industry has lost another star.</p>

<h3>Contending for Love and Getting a Child (Doctor Monica) (2)</h3>
<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>Their conversation mentioned Mary's dizziness, which suddenly reminded Mary of everything she encountered in Anna's house last time. As vivid as a picture, she remembered a sound that pierced into her heart. An honest and impolite voice told her an honest and impolite fact... that John was going to Europe and would be gone for six months. That was just a couple of sentences, but around Mary, who was playing the piano at the time, everything seemed to collapse as if the sky was spinning and the earth was turning. Breathing immediately felt difficult... everything in front of her was dark... she was unconscious. Mary tried her best to forget that terrible scene and return to the present. She forced a smile, expressing her shame to her two friends. Monica comforted her and said: (Then why do you keep it in your heart? I'm just worried about you, so I asked you, and you had to rush to an appointment afterwards, and you refused to go home immediately.)</p>
<p>In fact, that appointment was her appointment with John... the last time. Anna glanced at Mary sideways and teased her: (Who is your big lover now?) Mary paused and forced herself to say; (You don't know him.) Anna asked again: (Is he also on the boat)? Anna has always liked to joke without any malice. Because Mary couldn't answer for a while, she looked at her face and then shouted: (I know. He also went to Europe. Monica, look, her eyes are still swollen from crying.) Monica pinched Mary's arm and said: (Poor child. I understand the pain in your heart. But maybe you are better off than me, your lover must have seen you on the dock and waved to you.) At this moment, Mary felt that if this kind of piercing, wishful thinking conversation continued, she would go crazy. How will this incredible connection be resolved in the future. Her lover... Monica's man. The two were at the dock to see him off. The two each contained (eyes full of tears, swallowing down into their stomachs. Mary bit her own lips. She must cheer herself up and never give up. At this time, Monica's gentle voice poured into her deep thoughts again. Monica said: (While John is away, I will temporarily live in Anna's house. Baby, you come too, we are in the same boat and can comfort each other, it's good to be comforted. Hou Mary seemed to say with some fear: (I don't think it's a good idea.) Before she could decide, Anna gently pushed her into a car waiting by the roadside. She said: (Get in! Don't be stubborn! What you and Monica both need is a glass of wine.)</p>
<p>Mary walked to Anna's house with a heavy heart and unable to speak. When she got there, she suddenly started talking and laughing again. Anna was mixing drinks. Mary took it in her hand and bravely drained it in one gulp, waiting quietly for the onset of a numbing force. Anna is a well-known architect. She arranged her two friends and busied herself with work. Monica was alone by the fire, in the melting heat. It was as if she saw the shadow of her man. Mary was trembling, and she was thinking about thousands of things in her mind, and the wine glass in her hand kept spinning in her hand. She wasn't thinking about anyone else, but John. She thought about this strange thing, he should write it into a novel. But this is something in a novel, something that is not usually seen. Especially like Monica, John and herself, something they could never have dreamed of. But, in fact, this kind of thing did happen. (To be continued)</p>
