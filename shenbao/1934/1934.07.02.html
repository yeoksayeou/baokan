<h3>國社黨公報　肅淸反側經過　　革命陰謀醖釀已數月　羅赫木施萊轍係主動　希特勒親赴僧城撲滅　意發現大悖風化事件</h3>
<p>（柏林）此次事變之經過國社黨情報處發表公報、概略如下、</p>
<p>數月以來、國内有人輒擬計使衝鋒隊與國社黨及國家發生反感、參謀長羅赫木向受總理非常信任、非但不能阻止此種計畫、幷且加以鼓勵、彼未經禀明總理、乃與施萊轍將軍發生關係、及至此種計畫逐漸發展、私與某國交涉、爲黨國計、自不能不採取斷然手段、總理自發覺種種預謀事件後、卽於今晨二時親自飛往慕尼黑、立刻將關係最深之領袖解除職務、並下令逮捕、希特勒且立赴羅赫木休假之魏西地方、作根本之剗除、在逮捕羅赫木時、發現劣跡不可勝計、故總理下令一綱打盡、以免數百萬無辜民衆、遭其茶毒、總理並令普魯士總理戈林、在柏林亦採取同樣手段、尤須消滅與此次政變陰謀聨絡之反動派云、今午衝鋒隊領袖在慕尼黑會議、希特勒演說、謂彼對於衝鋒隊之信任心、仍舊不變、同時聲稱、凡不受約束及反抗命令之病態分子、必須消滅、希特勒謂衝鋒隊員之責任、係光榮之服務、已往已有數十萬隊員作重大之犧牲、故各人皆須爲此犧牲努力、以爲後來</p>
<p>者之模範、歷年以來、彼對於外間之攻擊、羅赫木曾竭力衛護、惟最近發生之事變、使彼不得不一舉而消滅此種野心者之反革命行動云、公報對施萊轍將軍之死聲稱、於已往數星期中、施氏曾與衝鋒隊總部人員及外國政府作危害國家之聨絡、其反政府之言行、皆有實據、被捕之時、施氏曾㧞槍反抗、雙方射擊、施氏卽受重傷、其妻欲思干涉、亦被槍傷云、</p>
<p>國社黨情報處已將槍斃之衝鋒隊領袖七人名字發表、國社黨公報則謂羅赫木與施萊轍二人爲此次陰謀之主動人物、並稱羅氏曾與某國代表互通消息云、（一日國民電）</p>
<p>僧城電國社黨通信報發表公報、對</p>
<p>于希特勒總理親自撲滅叛變經過情形、有所說明、據稱、總理淸晨四時乘飛機抵僧城航空塲、得悉僧城黨軍衝鋒隊隊員、曾於昨晚接得口號、謂「領袖（指希特勒）及國防軍、皆與吾儕衝鋒隊爲難、各隊員其揭竿起事乎」、旋悉巴維耶内務部長業已自動將黨軍高級隊長予以逮捕、希特勒乃親將各該隊長肩章扯下、褫去職務、五時三十分、總理率領隨從人員、往羅赫木别墅、至其臥室排闥而入、親自逮捕、羅氏俯首就縛、黨軍分隊長海恩斯亦寓同一别墅中、希特勒繼入海氏寢室、則見渠與變童同臥、醜態不堪卒觀、總理大怒、卽將海氏逮捕、又羅赫木參謀部人員及其衛隊、大半同時就逮云、公報聲明黨軍衝鋒隊對于總理、今後仍將矢忠不渝、並人士之可鄙行爲、亦因此而曝露無遺云云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>但澤方面　所傳叛變成因</h3>
<p>華沙但澤自由市德國保守派人士某、向此間每日畫報訪員發表宣言、說明國社黨叛變以前情形、據稱、「最近希特勒總理往東普魯士省紐特克城、晉謁興登堡總統、報告渠在威尼斯城與意相墨索里尼談話結果、同時以渠擬排斥巴本副總理之意、向總統陳述、興登堡對於巴本在瑪爾堡大學所作演說、（六月十七日所作、其内容係對國社黨内政有所誹議）、表示贊同、聞曾告希特勒、謂渠（總統自稱）與巴本完全關聨、巴氏若被迫辭職、則渠卽掛冠而去云云、希特勒乃向總統承諾、瑪爾堡城之演說對於巴本不致發生不良結果」云云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>叛首七名被槍决</h3>
<p>（柏林）國社黨衝鋒隊前參謀部長羅赫木·及分隊長海恩斯（普萊斯盧城知事）·恩斯特（柏林及勃蘭特堡省分隊長）及德登人、諸原係普魯士參政院議員、自此次事變發生後、普魯士總理戈林業將羅等四人參政院議員之職革除、其他分隊長</p>
<p>七人業被槍决、卽㈠僧城之施尼胡白、㈡海恩斯、㈢恩斯特、㈣僧城之施密德、㈤波麥拉尼省之赫恩、㈥海德白勒克、㈦斯柏蒂伯爵、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>施萊轍鴛鴦同命</h3>
<p>（柏林）前任總理施萊轍今晨因拒捕被殺、聞其夫人亦同時遇害、當警察入柏林郊外紐巴白爾斯堡村施氏寓所時、施卽㧞手槍與警察對抗、施夫人急置身其夫前以蔽護之、而彈中要害、一分鐘後、其夫亦飲彈殞命、（三十日路透社電）</p>
<h3>巴本被逮旋開釋</h3>
<p>副總理巴本今晨被逮、受盤詰後、卽經開釋、其寓所曾經搜查、（路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）副總理巴本亦有嫌疑、已受監視、副總理官舍亦經忠於政府之軍隊佔據、巴本之秘書卜斯昨日下午自殺、惟官塲方面謂彼與革命事件並無關係、其自殺完全爲私人關係、（一日國民電）</p>
<h3>羅赫木聽候審訊　一說已畏罪自戕</h3>
<p>（柏林）據美聨社訪員親往慕尼黑附近獄中控視所得消悉、謂衝鋒隊總司令羅赫木仍拘禁單人室中、羅氏昨日已經解職、並被開除黨籍、聽候軍法審判、（一日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）據僧城電訊、羅赫木已死、聞係自殺、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德奥間封鎖交通　防國社黨暴行</h3>
<p>（柏林）今日德國政局之發展、已引起柏林人士嚴重之惶慮、蓋恐國社黨之分裂、將在中歐發生反響也、如希特勒威權挫弱、則奥國邊陲之極端分之及德國境内之奥國國社黨員或將施行暴烈的運動、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>維也納德奥兩國間邊界業經正式完会封鎖、由德國駛來之火車、闑無一人、所有旅客皆在邊境一站下車、據此間接得菌斯勃魯克城消息、國社黨在奥國境内從事恐怖主義行動、實欲引人目光專注此事、而忽視國社黨衝鋒隊二次革命之醖釀云、星期三晚國社黨曾以炸藥接濟奥國黨徒、但大多數黨員齎軍火越境之時、爲奥國邊防軍所發覺當加逮捕云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德報　一致頌揚希特勒氏</h3>
<p>（柏林）希特勒以堅决靈敏之手腕、鎭壓事變、德國各報一致稱頌、柏林晨報謂、德國有若干份子與國社黨已無何等關係、然不憚與外國勾通、背叛祖國、希</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>星期壹（十）</p>
<p>特勒今竟决然對此等人予以懲治矣、柏林日報謂希氏之行動、予德國以保障、殊爲可幸、希氏之懲治、適當其時、又謂「希氏對於黨軍之統治、以忠誠·名譽·正直爲基礎、」地方指導報謂、「從今以後、無復敢爲第二次革命之論調者矣、」該報以爲戈林之爲人、乃以鐵腕懲治國家之敵人者、淸黨運動渠必能成功、德意志報謂此事發生、殊可惋惜、但現已完全結束、柏林交易所日報謂衝鋒隊將以希特勒所信任之新人物從新改組、該報謂、一此事在外國將引起如何印象乎、希特勒昨日見國家危殆、以一人之力、討平事變、其魄力之雄厚、個人之勇敢、世界各國政治首領就能與之比擬乎、」（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>挺進隊失政治地位</h3>
<p>（柏林）本日此間政變發生迅速、有迅雷之勢、然德國輿論並無若何公然反響、</p>
<p>國社黨黨軍參謀長羅赫木與黨軍其他要人被捕之消息、雜以種種穢聞、故普通人只注意猥褻之消息、而反忽視政治陰謀之重大、但由吾人觀之、此次事變之後、有一種結果、甚爲明顯、卽衝鋒隊各首領或被撤職、或不保首領、可見自今以後、如無意外情形發生、則衝鋒隊在德國政治上不復佔重要地位矣、第今日政府鎭壓之舉動、異常敏捷、其眞正關係如何、吾人尙難言之、副總理巴本之眞正情形、亦無人知之、外間關於巴本之消息、頗多予盾處、惟巴本僅在寓所被警察看守、並未逮捕、此層似已證實、巴本之被人視爲可疑、於此可見、但吾人似又不當以爲此事與衝鋒隊各領袖之被捕有何關係、吾人鑒於黨軍之革命份子及反叛份子之被懲治、或者以爲希特勒政治傾於反動、但宣傳部長戈培爾追隨希氏左右、終日不離、似又證明其不然、航空部長戈林謂此</p>
<p>次政府舉動、一方在懲治黨軍之不守紀律、一方又在鎭壓反動、前總理施萊轍結局之慘、以及其與政治陰謀之關係如公報所云者、殊令人難於索解、公報謂黨軍參謀長羅赫木與施萊轍發生關係、並有人謂有大規模之政治陰謀業已發動、希特勒之親信斯脫拉塞亦預聞其事、似已被捕、總之、吾人對於此次之事、借能得到唯一結論、卽希特勒欲維持威權、以抵抗右派或左派之反動、又有一事無可置疑者、卽國防軍目下已成國家威權主要因素之一、而在國防軍高級人員之心目下、希特勒卽爲國家之代表云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法報　料德政局從此多事</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法國輿論自若干時以來、卽感覺德國政局之混亂、以爲必有一日須根本解决、初不料變生不測、竟如是之倉卒也、此次事變之結果如何、尙無人能言之、希特勒之勝利、雖似業已定局、但吾人能否卽謂反對政府者業已降服乎、晨報謂、「吾人當知猛烈之反動、尙未終結、」小巴黎人報謂、「六月三十日、大約尙非希特勒主義革命第一階段之終結、假以時日、難免不再發生反動、」日報謂「戈林一派已爲戈培爾一派所壓倒、並有人謂極端派之企圖、爲國防軍所制止、」有數報表示同一意見、咸以爲一九一四年普魯士軍國主義之勢力、現又抬頭、」「斐卡洛」報謂、有一事已無可疑、卽「德國已操於國防軍之手、希特勒雖仍爲德國之象徴、但已成爲國防軍之繫囚、」人民報謂、「希特勒究居指導之地位乎、抑係聽人調動乎、然無論如何、在國防軍控制下之普魯士式德國、似已占優勝矣」云云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英報　國社制度根本動搖</h3>
<p>（瀋陽）昨日德國發生劇變、消息傳至倫敦、惟星期快報、將此間所得最初印象、播諸文字、其言曰、「德國衝鋒隊内部叛變行動、以及政府懲治之手段、足使國社制度爲之動搖、此固毫無可疑、從今厥後、希特勒當竭其權力、以期恢復其已失之威望」云云、星期快報雖有此論調、但今日星期日此間各報大體緘默、不作批評、蓋將待各該報之柏林訪員德國自副總理巴本在瑪爾堡大學發表演說以後發生之各種動相、作成詳細之報告也、惟觀今日各報新聞之前、多冠以有意義之標題、亦足以見希特勒以慘酷之手段、遏制自己黨徒之極端行動、在英國方面、未賞不發生憂傷之印象也、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美報　戈培爾態度堪注目</h3>
<p>（紐約）據紐約時報華盛頓訪員所稱、謂德國事變突起、美國國務院早有所見、故消息傳來、亦不以爲異、惟其暴烈突兀若是之甚、則爲始料所不及耳、國務院某官員素以熟悉德國問題著稱者、語紐約時報訪員謂、目前國務院之最注意者、厥爲德國宣傳部長戈培爾今後所取之立塲如何、蓋在華盛頓之觀察、以爲戈培爾截至現在爲止、向持極端態度、昨日之復、顯爲兩種不同傾向之互鬨、戈培爾究將何所適從歟、此則關係重大、値得注目者也、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>内政危機依然未去</h3>
<p>（紐約）紐約泰晤士報發表社論、評德國事變、謂前總理施萊轍之殞命、以及希特勒下令處决衝鋒隊各首領兩事、證明希特勒現已决意利用國防軍、以消滅國社黨之左翼、該報又謂、希特勒平日對於下屬曲予優容、雖渠等之行動、足以妨害國社黨名譽、希氏亦曲爲諒解、然此次事變、證明希氏態度已大爲改變矣、由德國傳來之消息、可見德國如欲避免内亂、必須樹立軍人獨裁制、紐約泰晤士報旋將已本在馬爾堡大學演說以後德國發生之事變、逐一叙述、並謂巴本演說、定必取得希特勒之贊同、該報繼稱、「德國内政上之危機、因種種因素而日趨嚴重、其中以關於外交上因素、最爲重要」云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福昨晨乘艦出巡　經由巴拿馬運河區域　本月廿四日可抵檀島</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）總統羅斯福今日結束工作甚多、準備於明日淸晨由亞納波里斯灣起程出巡、總統登舟後、仍擬每晨辦理政府公事、至少數小時云、總統所定行程今日白宮公布如下、七月一日晨七時離亞納波里斯、五日游海地角、六日游拍托里科、七日維爾京羣島湯默里、八日維爾京羣島聖克羅格斯、十日科倫比亞加泰其那、十一日巴拿馬國及運河區域、二十四日抵檀香山、二十八日離檀香山、八月二日或三日返抵太平洋岸、今日總統所辦要公如下、㈠派定交易所管理委員、㈡簽署鐵路工人養老金案、㈢派定全國勞工管理局人員、㈣簽署農村破產法案、㈤指派莫發脫爲居屋法案行政專員、㈥派定航空郵政研究委員、㈦派定聨邦通訊管理委員、（一日國民社電）</p>

<h3>西北視察記　到寗夏</h3>
<p>本報特派記者</p>
<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>十日上午八時、發官靈渡、綏（遠）寗（夏）駝行、各有界限、包頭來寗者多抵河卸𫙊�</p>
<p>、另行雇脚入城、駝卽速返草地、若過河、須另起寗省𫙊捐、每頭化銀、多至三元餘、有時且有藉無駝捐抓差之事發生、而當地駝行、爲營業競爭起見、亦必予以種種不便、此種情形、不僅綏駝爲然、卽寗駝赴包、亦莫不然、駝夫爲欲逃避捐差、本擬昨夜趕至河邊、未明卽返、又恐駝力不勝、擬於今夜行之、嗣朱周兩君、告以素與稅界相認識、畫行不致發生意外、乃改今晨早發、然駝夫鑒於前車、終不釋懐、除遣人先往觀察外、幷將駝鈴收藏、悄行無聲、情同偷營、行三十里、至草地盡頭、而此睽違兼旬之黄河、已濚然在望、又十里山巒起伏、澗壑深陷、巉巉濯濯、不生草木、宛轉繞下、卽抵河邊、貨𫙊�</p>
<p>卸堆如山、勢難完全渡過、予與周白二君、先行渡往通昌堡、另雇騾馬、以便明日入寗、</p>
<p>堡距河八里、沿途樹林彌望、溝渠縱横、麥地鋪靑、野花爭艶、夏意濃濃、不似河東草地、白沙黄草、猶是三冬氣味、得非「一河分東西、寒燠兩不同」歟、夜宿一回人所開之餅店、壁懸對聨數付、上欵賀句、一無所有、下欵僅書某人恭賀、亦欹斜不堪、詢之乃悉「縱餽潤資、猶無人代書也、」實用禮品、多不勝舉、沾沾徒務虚表於此、足見因襲性之牢不可破也、主人</p>
<p>爲備晚餐、味尙可口、飲「蓋盌茶、」内置磚茶、紅白糖·棗子·柿餅·各物、香甜解渴、若娶新婦、尙加蓮子·杏仁·葡萄·芝蔴·桂圓·荔枝·諸品、厥名「花茶、」傳係西夏赫連勃勃某妃所發明、後人歡讌嘉賓、照例僅飲香水、不能盡食茶心、隨烹隨棄、亦讌會中之浪費也、</p>
<p>翌晨、就堡略作小遊、居民屋宇整嚴、體幹健壯、什九皆爲回族、若門户舊壞、精神萎靡者、不問亦可料其必爲漢民也、蓋回人多勤苦、無烟癖、漢人則「無烟不吸、有錢便懶、」其在生活上之表現、自各逈然不同、此不僅個人觀察如此、寗人亦多承認之、吾漢族乎、旣自覺矣、尙不处振、更待何時、一淸眞寺、孫殿英犯寗佈告、尙貼其門、略謂「凡我官兵、不准入内、以維軍譽、幷免傷民族感情、」知孫軍已進抵於此、惟未在此接火、報免城魚之殃、此間田地、可灌唐渠之水、質味膏腴、產量素豐、普通地價、每畝六十万丈、値價百元、此則稱「能種雅片之上上地、」若僅可種糧食、則貶價六十元矣、向地主租耕、不納壓租、所繳數、多爲主四佃六之標準、田隅地角、叢葬回塚、形作長方、高出地面尺許、頂平邊級、以土堊成、旁植柳樹、絮花正紛紛落地、</p>
<p>堡立小學一所、門爲西式建築、上題「化雨春風、」入爲平屋三四間、學生手執國語·常識·論語·孟子·三字經·百家姓·等書、自由誦讀、問「敎員何在、」一生手指一室曰、「在那裏·李老師、」入見二長裳者、皆垂首抱膝、假寐坑上、學生呼醒、因先問一老者「尊姓、」答曰「不敢、姓李、」次及年靑者、所答亦然、問「是否一爲校長、一爲敎員、」老者答·「敎員僅我一人、彼（指年靑者）乃小犬、助打紅墨、校長乃百家姓之頭一姓、若無要事、不輕到校、」問「敎科如何、」答·「學生四十餘人、程度至爲不齊、不敎四書、家長又不歡迎、全敎四書、又與敎局章程牴觸、故新舊各科、混合敎授、唱歌也有、體操也有、倘廢除舊書、全讀新書、不但說話、連文彩没有、卽朋友初見、互談姓氏、亦往往格不相入、請敎先生（指記者）、到寗貴幹、聽是南方口音、寗省財敎兩廳長、亦南方人、若往求事、必有好差、」談至此、店主來呼、出見留河行李、刻已運至、乃整裝而發、</p>
<p>五里、通貴堡、户口七八十、回居什九、漢居什一、孫軍犯寗時、曾搜糧於此、後彼失敗、似因有通敵嫌疑之窮户、忽被首蒙白巾之人、仇殺數家、幸當局迅予注意、此一不幸事、遂潛消於無形、此去堡舍益多、雞犬相聞、水利土肥、可甲西北、溪梅園桃、結實纍纍、大如栂指、望生酸涎、倘於三春過此、碧波良田、落英繽紛、必興置身桃源之感、「寗夏爲塞北之江南、」斯言信不我欺、農塲作物、嬰粟約占百分之三十五、麥及雜糧、約占百分之三十未種閒地、約占百分之三十五、大部份係候種秋糧、小部份已成三數年未種之熟荒、農夫農婦、頭帶芨芨草帽、手握數寸小鋤、膝行嬰粟畦中、從事耘草工作、</p>
<p>二十里、遠見雙塔、皦然插霄、白君告以「此爲北塔、孫軍攻城、卽敗北於其下、彼爲西塔、係在城中、曾受地震之害、雙塔一見、寗城亦將至矣、」再行十五里、經一鹽沼、幷刻正在拆除中之高台寺、卽抵寗夏東門、城高三丈許、外層磚石、因防孫軍攻扒、已被拆加雉堞之上、内土外裸、甚爲堅固、不易梭下、守城槍兵三、令下驢檢查、幷將護照、呈排長騐視、排長高坐城樓、戰傷未愈、策杖倚垜、俯詢數言、</p>
<p>始准入城、城中僅有旅館一處、傷兵尙未移出、白君邀宿其家、欵待周至、盛情可感、晚應周君「第一池」沐浴之約、攬鏡自照、鬚髮皆長、面目全非、不覺人笑影亦笑、</p>

<h3>本市新聞　海關進口新稅則　昨爲星期今日公布　華商憂慮日商活動</h3>
<p>申時社云、財政部擬定海關進口新稅則、業經中央核准、並由財部訓令海關總稅務司署、轉令全國各海關、於本月一日起實施、本埠江海關、亦已奉到該項訓令、因昨日適逢星期、停止辦公、該項新稅則、定於今日正式公布、申時社記者、特探誌各情如次、</p>
<h3>新稅内容</h3>
<p>此次新稅則、其减低或增加稅率、全</p>
<p>以國内外貿易情形而定、奢侈品如化裝香品、毛織品、消耗品、烟酒五金、及化學品等、均酌量增加、此外凡無國產代用品之貨物及原料品二十餘種、均予以减低、棉紗减低範圍百分之五、人造絲年來銷華日增、但以稅率過高、大多漏私、殊非上策、故此次新稅則、亦特予减低、以杜流弊、</p>
<h3>今日實施</h3>
<p>本埠江海關、業已奉總稅務司署訓令、於昨日起施行新稅則因適値禮拜、故於今日正式實行、凡各輪裝載貨物來華、於今日起報關者、卽遵照新稅則辦理、此外全國各海關曁華北長城口各分卡、亦於卽日起、實行該項新稅則、以昭劃一、</p>
<h3>日商活動</h3>
<p>此次新稅則之改訂、日方殊爲重視、前日使有吉、特以此事分訪汪蔣諸氏、詢問甚久、現新稅則旣已履行、日人頗爲欣慰、據申時社記者昨向本埠日使館探悉、日官方對此次新稅則之訂立、表示好感、本埠日商人、現已紛紛活動、預備運貨來華傾銷、據一般觀察、新稅則實施後、日貨將更形充斥我市塲云、</p>
<h3>榮宗敬談</h3>
<p>大公社云、記者嗣又向實業界鉅子榮宗敬氏處探詢、據稱、財部此次改訂之海關新稅率、雖未得悉詳細條文、然而傳聞其中對棉紗進口稅將减低百分之五一點、殊使我國棉紡業有莫大影響、蓋日本棉紡業、素執亞東牛耳、如果再行减低稅率、更將造成其對吾傾銷機會、我國棉紡業、年來受世界不景氣潮流、本已奄無生氣、如果再受此項外貨傾銷之重大打擊、勢非完全崩潰不止、棉紡商人、爲切身利害計、故已會同全國經濟委員會棉業統制會切實商洽、僉謂財部此舉、對於棉紡業實有重大不利、故擬推派代表晋京、關於减低棉紗進口稅一層、將請財部愼重考慮、或逕予收回成命也云云、</p>

<h3>又有一批　房主自動減租</h3>
<p>滬埠市面蕭條、前曾有多數房主先後自行减租者、茲悉又有房主、繼續自動减租、特分錄如下、㈠南市民國路商號通達公司·慶豐盛·等、因營業淸淡、房租高貴、最近曾懇託南區减租會致函房主雷允上等要求减租、現房主王靈君、已面允通報公司、每月照原租洋减去二十元、雷允上已派代表趙德如至南區减租會磋商减低辦法、㈡南市區裏馬路太平里、自成立减低房租支會以後、積極從事减租運動、未嘗稍懈、近已由房東方面代表與支會代</p>

<h3>中日間　無線電報忙碌　無恥華人爭定日貨</h3>
<p>國際電信局中日通報、營業甚佳、每日平均三百餘通、且日呈增加之勢、據該局負責者談、其原因如次、</p>
<h3>爭向日本定貨</h3>
<p>中日貿易、最近因日金低落、使日本商人之成本减低、故力向我國輸入、反顧我國、工商業幼稚、出品之優良與價</p>
<p>廉、遠非日貨所敵、同時一般商人、皆唯利是圖、遂爭向日本定貨、因之中日間電報、日益增加、</p>
<h3>水綫不足應用</h3>
<p>在中日未直接通報前、中日間電報、全歸大東大北所發、然該公司水綫、中</p>
<p>日綫乃中美綫之一部份、故甚形忙碌、且</p>
<p>日人顧及中日通報、報費爲中日兩方平／均所得、若由大北公司拍發、日人方面所得利益甚少、以愛國心之出發點、故多與國際電信局交易、至於日本電信社會、雖有水綫、然僅足供日人報社之新聞電而已、</p>

<h3>代表致詞</h3>
<p>㈠市黨部陶百川致辭、略云、各位都是篤實敦厚的商界領袖、此次就職、責任非常重大、因爲最近四年、不論國際國内、都是在千鈞一髮的時期中、國際形勢變遷很大、譬如日本退出國聨、將來不免發生統治的島的衝突、俄國五年計劃已經完成、他們重工業進步得很快、俄國的經濟力量、一天一天發達、所以現在一個國家、不僅要在政治上努力、還要在經濟力量上努力、而且現在歐洲各國、爲了薩爾區域發生爭執、究竟如何結果、也須在一九三六年的選舉結果而定、英美日爲海軍五五三比例、不能妥洽時、亦足以爆發世界大戰、我們在這嚴重時期、唯有刻苦耐勞、齊心協力、發展工商、在此三四年内、實爲建設和平之最大關鍵、現在匪區已經將次剿平、全國將次統一、應當從事生產、吾人旣知國際形勢之嚴重、其爭點不在大西洋、而在太平洋、尤其是中國、更其是上海、所以我們的責任、很是重要、很是困難、諸位爲工商兩業的中心人物、便是首當其衝、所謂禍福休戚、關係很是密切、所以希望各位負起責任、特别努力、我記得從前在學校裏做作文、往往有「戰勝疆塲」和「戰勝商塲」之句、現在眞可謂戰勝商塲之非常時期、吳稚老說、「他拿槍來打我、我也以槍去打他、</p>
<p>」現在人家都注重工商、拿貨物來傾銷、我不妨也拿貨物來抵制他、仿照俄國的五年計劃、希望各位領袖、大家生產上努力、㈡社會局吳相如云、此次各位當選、很不容易、這就是各位是全市商人所愛戴的人物、諸位在此千鈞一髮的時候、責任很大、我們現在知道、一個國家的方量、完全在經濟問題、現在各國都受着生產過剩、所以極力注意於貨物的出路、政治勢力達到的地方、就是貨物推銷的地方、我國每年入超不知要多少、一年一年的入不敷出的過下去、我們要永遠維持生命綫、一定要開發經濟泉源、我幾天内、國際貿易局發表入超减去百份之三六、現在可分爲幾層解釋、㈠是爲我們人民漸漸覺悟、㈡是我們農村經濟破產、購買力薄弱、㈢生產進步、各種貨物都有替代品、現在這種現象很好、我們還希望由入超而變爲出超、將金錢搬回來、這全在各位以很好計劃、研究和實行、共同發展、由上海市面推廣到全中國、使現在恐慌時期、安穩渡過、這是希望諸位努力的、</p>

<p>致乾涸、農民灌漑、困苦難言、災象已成、民食堪虞、疫病叢生、各醫院幾有人满之患、入晚後悶熱更甚、至下午九時許、忽見天空電光閃閃、未幾又起巨風、飛沙走石、大有山雨欲來之勢、熱氣全消、頓覺</p>

<p>、已歷十餘年、故棧中一切已經陳舊、平日棧内進出各貨、則由該公司委派賬房高龍翔·戴殿倫·兩人擔任管理、並有棧司四名、操作雜務、每日淸晨六時開門、以便各客商提存貨物、但至旁晚六時、即行閉門、</p>
<h3>淸晨火起</h3>
<p>昨晨五點零五分、天甫黎明時、該第一號堆棧内、不知如何、突告失愼、頃刻濃烟密佈、烈燄飛騰、當爲附近崗警發覺、急即飛報該管一區總署、轉報救火聨合會、立即嗚鐘告警、俄由各區救火會各驅帮浦甫、紛紛到塲接水灌救、當用鐵器將門窗撬開後、始得將皮帶拖入、放水澆救、</p>
<h3>撲救熄滅</h3>
<p>其時中央及法租界各救火會、亦均聞警驅車前來、協助澆救、當經各救火員扳登屋頂、將堆棧之鐵皮屋頂、設法撬開、灌水入内、斯時棧中各貨、大半已經着火、惟因棧户緊閉、故火勢蔓延不廣、但自屋頂撬開、火得風助、向上直衝、一時紅光燭天、浦水掩映、旋經中西救火員竭力施救、至七點四十五分、火始熄滅、惟該第一堆棧、已經全部焚燬矣、</p>
<h3>燬損總數</h3>
<p>當火熾時、該管一區關區長聞報、立即督帶巡宫郭繼紛、警長龐子麟、及大批長警飛馳前往、在火塲四週、實行彈壓、迨火熄後、調查得該棧内所堆客貨、計有南通大生紗廠之粗布二百餘件、細紗七百餘件、及廣源祥豐等號所存之黄豆花米等糧食四千餘件、此次被火焚燬者、共佔三分之二、餘下三分之一、則均遭水漬、估計客貨及堆棧房等、損失約達十餘萬元之譜、所幸各貨、均保有鉅額火險、</p>
<h3>原因未明</h3>
<p>此次起火原因不明、故即將該棧賬房高龍翔、帶回區中、由關區長帶案預審時、高龍翔供、棧中起火時、在本日淸晨五點零五分鐘、故棧房門尙未開啟、不知火從何來等語、當飭暫留候派警調查起火眞相、並將該公司總經理楊管一拘案後、併解市公安局訊究、</p>

<h3>志文出亡事非無因　靜安寺一部被封　　債務糾葛問題完全證明係事實發封時志汶外出出亡之說似實</h3>
<p>靜安寺住持志汶和尙、因債務糾葛出亡、大通社記者於昨日上午八時、特親赴靜安寺詳細探訪、則志汶燕息之所、業被江蘇上海第一特區地方法院查封、詳情妇次、</p>
<h3>債務糾葛證明事實</h3>
<p>大通社記者於昨晨赴該寺探詢眞相時、該寺緇素、初不顧表示、嗣經記者疏解結果、始承該寺司賬劉金榮（鎭江人）出見、據劉君云、關於志汶挾欵出走一節、並非事實、（本社昨稿對此說亦未下斷）至債務糾葛、則係事實、並謂該項糾葛、完全係志汶個人之事、與十方叢林之靜安寺、初不相涉也、</p>
<h3>志汶燕息之處被封</h3>
<p>劉君繼謂外傳志汶出走消息之由來、厥由江蘇上海第一特區地方法院於上月二十六日下午發封志汶臥室所起、劉君語至此、記者因要求其導觀法院查封之臥室、劉君允之、乃隨其入庫房後面之廻廊、廊盡爲延接香客之前後方丈室、志汶臥室位於後方丈之右、其門上懸白竹布一方、其面積大小、適與門齊、宛如門簾、記者乃揭布諦視、則法院之封條、卽交叉貼於門上、文曰「江蘇上海第一特區地方法院假扣押志汶之動產」記者睹此、當以債務葛之說、已證明非虚、乃復偕劉君退入庫房室暢談一切、</p>
<h3>出亡消息厥由此興</h3>
<p>劉君續謂、當二十六日下午、法院承法吏朱姓率同法警二名、並債權人葛和卿來寺發封時、志汶適外出、彼等欲就大門上發封、當經本人與之理論、以封條上明寫以假扣押志汶動產爲限、與寺院本身、並不相涉、故結果僅發封志汶臥室、及其室内一應器具、惟當查封時、因志汶之外出、出亡消息、因之而興、</p>
<h3>志汶談話債務大概</h3>
<p>大通社記者嗣後根據劉君所述、赴成都路貞吉里五號陳則民律師處、　　親與志汶和尙會面、至此、關於其並未出亡消息、得一有力證明矣、惟據志汶談、該項債務糾葛、尙係民國二十二年舊案、債權人葛和卿現住愷自邇路振土里二號、至糾葛内容若何、未肯表示、第謂已由陳則民律師撰狀聲請法院啟封云、</p>

<p>丨答李如晦君丨</p>
<p>其次中國舊劇是不是象徴主義的呢？蘇聨現在是不是流行着𧰼徴主義呢？顯然的，這是有意的造謠！中國舊劇我們可以說絲毫没有包含𧰼徴主義的成分。𧰼徴主義是以官感的具體記號來表現一種神秘的，感情的頃向和作風，但中國舊劇，其取材大半是歷史上的傳說，其立論文大都是「勸善罰惡」的老套，這裏面旣毫不含有神秘的感情，也就用不着以官感的具體的記號來𧰼徴什麽。我們從舊劇中能看到一齣表現得不明不白使人難解的劇嗎？要表現忠臣，就只那一套忠臣的情節，要表現奸賊，也就只有那一套奸賊的情節，一切都是刻板的，固定的，就藝術價値上說，這種單純的表現方法是低級的，與西方資本主義制度下所產生的𧰼徴主義有非常大的距離，即如那一般人認爲最爲含有𧰼徴主義味的臉譜，（三花臉是表現奸臣，如曹操嚴嵩等的臉譜；紅臉是表現忠勇，如關羽趙匡胤等的臉譜。）和那以馬鞭代馬的玩意兒，那也只能說是藉以帮助勸衆對於劇情的理解，（一方面也表明演劇技術的簡單）而不</p>
<p>能認爲即是負，𧰼徴主義。所謂𧰼徴主義不是指形式，主要的是指内容。至於蘇聨，誠如李君所家不正在以明快的筆，描寫社會主義建設的各面嗎？蘇聨劇壇，已經屬於大衆自己，他們不需要𧰼徴主義，他們不會把文化推回到資本主義文化的舊路上去。𧰼徴主義是病態心理的表現，而蘇聨大衆正當健全的時候，正大興奮的努力建設，怎會走上𧰼徴主義的道路呢？說蘇聨寫實主義已漸没落，象徴主義正在流行的人，明明是「借屍還魂」，借這爲中國舊劇張目，他們看到徐悲鴻在巴黎開展覧會，就認爲中國畫已在世界上站有地位，看到西方出了幾個和尙，就認爲東方精神文明已經戰勝了西洋的物質文明，同樣，看到蘇聨來請梅蘭芳演劇，就認爲中國舊劇要在世界劇壇上發揚光大了，這是整個復古的企圖。還有，是對蘇聨現狀的曲解，如世界上許多名流學者，認蘇聨有回到資本主義道路上去的頃向一樣，他們用這來否認蘇聨文化建設的成功，以爲蘇聨社會主義現實主義已經走不通，而要回到𧰼徴主義的懐裏去！可惜的，事實上蘇聨文學戲劇上的社會主義現實主義已在隨着整個文化建設，邁步向前發展，即侍桁君那些「萬一的說法，蘇俄也像美國似地再給梅蘭芳一個雙料學位，···」也只好算是侍桁君聰明的推論。</p>
<p>然而，蘇聨之請梅蘭芳，究竟是並不如侍桁君所說一樣是因爲有閒錢，因爲「好奇，」而另有其意義。誰都知道蘇聨正在儘量接受世界文學遺產，蘇聨劇塲正在歡迎沙士比亞等的古典劇。這一情形，正和德國希特勒的焚書相對照，表明蘇聨對於世界文化關公丨只有批判的接受舊文化，才能創造新文化，反過來說，只有新文化的建設者才能吸取舊文化中的一切精髓。中國舊劇雖然已是死去了的東西，已成了墓中的骷髏，但它畢竟有悠久的歷史，迷惑過中國的一般大衆，實不容輕輕否認其存在的價値，所以蘇聨之請梅蘭芳不是要看男扮女裝的梅郎，而是和奏演沙士比亞等的古典劇有同樣的意義，（當然中國舊劇的藝術價値，是與沙比亞等的古典劇，藝術價値，相差不知有幾千萬里）企圖能够在這遼遠的沙漠上，揀出些微的碎金，</p>
<p>以此，我們的結論是：梅蘭芳赴俄演劇，旣不能使瀕危的舊劇復活起來，也不致「丢」掉中國什麽人的臉。認東三省是亡於胡蝶之手，與認徐悲鴻在巴黎發揚中國文化，同樣是滑稽無聊，有意歪曲事實。中國舊劇的缺乏藝術性中國舊劇的失掉了存在的根據，而至淪於没落，乃是無可挽回的事。這不僅是些鑼鼓臉譜，以及男扮女裝等枝枝節節的問題，而是戲劇本質的問題。中國舊劇，遠離開了目前大衆的實生尖，風波亭，走麥城等劇，已不是引起大衆的同情，大衆需要的是他們當前的活生生的生活反映；在舞台上他們已不要看那些如關羽岳飛等的忠孝行爲而是要看那新的英雄姿態的出現。季子君勸梅蘭芳敎些女弟子來傳他的衣鉢鞏固起舊劇的基礎是就由於只看到形式一面，而發生出來的夢話。</p>
<p>同樣，我們爲了堅决反對舊劇，我們便不能不立即創作代替舊劇，成爲大衆欣賞的藝術的新興戲劇。我們要求出幾年來新興劇劇之不能獲得廣大的大衆的擁護的原因。另有方面我們要在舊戲劇中吸取那所能吸取大衆的成份。我們固還没有達到如蘇聨那樣儘量接受遺產的時候，但舊形式的利用（如流動劇團的組織，及用鼓號或大鑼大鼓以興奮大衆。）要新形式没有長成的時候，我們决不能抹殺，我們應該如何注意舊劇在大衆中的影響呵！（完）</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>此外，還有鮮嫩的竹笋，和絕細的　芽，也是太后所中意的素菜；不論「正餐」或「小吃」，總得敎他們做上來的。</p>
<p>菌類在中國出產得最多，大約有七八種以上。蒙古地方也有，比内地各處所產的還要大一些，滋味也格外豐腴些。太后對於菌，更是十二分的歡喜，所以無論在什麽菜餚裏，只要不是絕對不可能的話，便總有香菌或麻茹和在裏面。但是菌類對於我，倒並無怎樣特殊的好感。我覺得山東膠菜的滋味，實在是蔬菜中最美妙的一種，它的葉子差不多是純白色，又嫩又甜，我往往是盡量的吃，不肯停止。</p>
<p>中國各地像膠菜那樣著名的菜，眞是多得不能計算，而就中尤以四川一省所產的東西，最爲名貴，亦最受人歡迎。譬如說銀耳那樣東西，它的市價是貴極了，往往一小匣的銀耳，要化一二十兩銀子才買得到。它們是寄生在老松樹上的一種下等植物，不過好不容易覓到好的，所以價錢是絕無理由的貴起來了。而且就是尋常人或官員，願意化多量的錢去買它的話，也不容易得到最好的；理由是因爲最好的銀耳，已成了在四川省做官的人孝敬太后的一種專利品；他們雇了許多的工人，常年在那裏搜尋最好的銀耳，拿來去纠結太后。</p>
<p>銀耳在裝運的時候、總是已經烘囇得很乾了，且還依着它們的價値的高下，分别裝在各式各樣的錦盒裏面；最精緻的錦匣，往往也要値到好幾兩銀子一個。裏面所盛着銀耳的價値，便可想而知了！但是價値雖是這樣高貴，然而它的滋味，却委實不知道好在那裏，旣不鹹，又不甜，也没有香味；總之，吃了它，等於没有吃什麽東西一樣。所以它總是放在鷄汁或其他的鮮湯裏一起煮的。（七二）</p>
<h3>曲阜之柳子調</h3>
<p>— 病鴛</p>
<p>言爲心聲，言之不足，故永歌之。可知歌本爲人類情調之一種發揮，必無疑義。迨世界文化大進，人類智理，亦與日俱增；於是由無形之歌曲，進出組成有形之戲劇。更分支派，探源流，時至今日，遂成爲八大藝術之一。在我國戲劇萌芽之初，率多因地制宜，發揚其藝，亦卽暴露各個地方與各個社會之風土人情也。譬如</p>
<p>直省有「磞磞戲」，陜中有「梆子腔」，魯東有「柳子調」，是皆足以代表該三省地方之民情風俗，幷爲文物之徴𧰼。「梆子腔」在皮未盛之前，亦曾握一時代之戲劇重心，所惜戲情與腔調，於悲哀欲絕聲中，復趨於高元激烈，而脚本編訂，及唱做之原則，往往毁棄倫理而不顧，故雖殺喊連天，實無提倡民族勇武有致之精神。蓋每一劇情，無不缺乏法理，宜其在今日舞台藝術爭相猛晋之時，自未能容其安然存在矣。「磞磞戲」，固屬地方劇之一種，淫靡傖俗，斯更下品，尙未克登大雅之堂，又安望邁進藝術之林乎？獨「柳子調」，温靜幽逸，聲淸而調越，别創一格、初未可以地方小戲而忽之。按「柳子調」係山東曲阜獨有之音，有「九腔十八調七十二哼哼」之稱，唱時用笛子與呼胡，吹拉相應和，副以鏜鑼板鼓，肖狀肖聲，頗饒逸趣，若謂近於崑腔，實又非是。有「來遲」一戲，爲最普通之脚本，其曲牌，則有「元二三板娃娃」「雪連枝」等名目，亦猶之皮簧之分「快慢原」諸板眼也。至其所以命名爲「柳子調」者，相傳係魯男子之遺音，不過在當日仲連先生果否曾具此豪情逸興，引吭而歌，居然得遺其妙音於數千年後、愚以爲前未及見古人，誠無此膽量，敢作肯定耳。</p>
<h3>吳媽</h3>
<p>— 筆山</p>
<p>吳媽雖然年老，却還有氣力，替人家洗衣服，掙錢買飯吃。所以我們這宿舍裏，天天總有伊的足跡。　　伊爲人很忠實，常常發現誰的衣袋裏，有鈔票，角票，伊總原封不動的還給誰。因此有都很敬重伊，聽伊自由出入宿舍，從没有人監視過。</p>
<p>最近有幾個學生，在外面招攬一位年紀很輕面貌很漂亮的姑娘，到宿舍來拿衣服去洗。吳媽並不知道，只覺天氣漸漸炎熱了，而換衣服的，反日見其少。　　前天早晨，伊剛來到寢室門外，迎面撞見一位漂亮的姑娘，夾了一大包衣服，向外走。後面還跟着幾個學生，且走且笑。吳媽向後退了幾步，靠着板壁，倒抽了兩口冷氣，瞧他們走遠了，伊才自言自語的道：「這樣看來，我這隻飯碗，要發生危險了！」</p>
<p>過了幾天，東家發現有幾個學生躱嬾，查究根抵，原來是和這年輕的洗衣姑娘，在宿舍裏談心，東家可不願意·一面訓斥學生一頓，一面禁止這洗衣的姑娘，再到宿舍裏來。</p>
<p>吳媽聽到這個消息，背後對人說：「到底上帝有眼睛！不然，有了年紀的人，縱然有氣力，也不能够掙飯吃啦。」</p>
<h3>羅宋人</h3>
<p>— 乃令</p>
<p>穿着襤褸的衣衫，帶着疲乏的臉面，隨街隨巷逡巡着的羅宋人，在上海我們是見慣了的；尤其是在法租界一帶。</p>
<p>這種隨處漂流的羅宋人，是什麽時候到了上海，我們可不曉得。我們所曉得的，只是這些羅宋人是從俄羅斯來的，是一九一七以後從俄羅斯被驅逐出來的貴族，有權勢的人；同時，這些羅宋人，也有人喊他們爲白俄的。</p>
<p>昨天在愛多亞路上，我又遇見到一個這樣的羅宋人，他是被許多我們貴國人士包圍着的；他也像其他的羅宋人一樣，喝醉了酒，蹒跚地在人羣中哈哈的笑着。大家見他好玩，都想盡方法逼他玩。結局是一位吃甘蔗的傢伙，把蔗渣於進他的後領里。這羅宋人登時轉喜爲怒，發起火來。但是放蔗渣的人早已跑得很遠了，羅宋人却發狂似的追上去，許多看熱鬧的人也跟在他後邊。</p>
<p>還是他跑得快，終於追上那惡作劇的人；可是他只作着手勢，責問那人爲什麽要把蔗渣放進他領里。這被責問的人，什麽也不說，便伸出他的碗大的拳頭，在羅宋人的面前搖動着；羅宋人不理，還是作着手勢，這樣繼續的作着手勢，作着手勢，却不提防一下子给搥了一拳，跌在地下。這次眞使羅宋人發火了，他爬了起來，搶上前來，但是許多看熱鬧的人，你推一下，我推一下，又把羅宋人推倒在地下；繼着大家便哈哈哈哈地笑了起來。</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>夏令素食品</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>到了夏天，最要緊是淸潔兩字；尤其是在吃的當兒，更不可不加以注意。譬如日常的飯菜，你，倘若隨便，碰著粗魚大肉，不管他吃得吃不得，也就满口大嚼，不由得會發生毛病；古人說：「禍從口出，病從口入，」這兩句話，正是很深切的敎訓；現在厲行新生活時候，我以爲非但要淸潔，還是素食相宜，而且從經濟上打算，比較起來，恰合節約的主義；故略寫幾種家常飯菜，獻給注意衛生的同志們看看：至於口味同不同，則關於各人的嗜别，只得大家自便了！</p>
<p>翡翠玉如意菉荳，原來是淸凉的東西，在夏天燒成了粥，吃「菉荳湯，」或者製成了塊，呌做「菉荳糕，」那末，極其可口；然而只好當作充飢的點心，不可以拿來做肴饌；所以從前大聰明，把菉荳和水入了木桶，使他温度適宜，到萌發的錯不多，過了一時，就生出雪白的芽來，這就是「菉荳芽：」價錢旣便家，而物品又是純潔，望去一白如銀，可以用開水泡，泡後，用醬麻油來拌，當作冷食，入口極爽利，一些没有滞膩；倘若熟者，用豆油淸炒，也不費火候，只須三四分鐘，就可以起鍋，或者再加些極嫩的韮菜，約比菉豆芽十分之一二，白是白來綠是綠，色采眞覺好看，前人定了一個名詞，稱他「翡翠玉如意，」實在有點道理；因爲不論那一種人家，通常都可以佐膳，而簡省以外，並且還能淸暑，可算是獨一無二了。</p>
<p>羅漢見彌陀羅漢菜本來是吾們嘉定的特產恐怕其他地方，還没有知道呢？這一種菜是野生的，大小和薺菜一樣，然而也不是處處有的不過西鄕像黄渡安亭一帶，在田邊壟畔生得略多；其他東南各鄕，可說完全不看見，近來有人收了他的種子，用人功來播種，其實終不及紧生的好，因爲鮮味薄弱，香頭亦不足，這是無可勉强的；通常吃法春初時候，用鹽和菜，以手反覆壓熟，再逼去其水分，然後裝入　甏，封好，倒置極乾的稻柴灰缸中，過了當年的黄霉，就可以吃了，做手得法，雖經過兩三年，亦可不壞，所以專做這種菜當生意的，他的牌子上，總冒稱「陳羅漢菜」四字，講起實際來，恐還不及半年哩！人家吃時大半充當粥菜，不知拿他來做湯，也比雪裏葓更要鮮得多，倘相洋蕃手，熟煮後，用剷刀在鍋内榻成了極柔和的沙一般，和以羅漢菜，約十分之一二，再炒了幾炒，或加些焦鹽，吃起來，眞是其味無窮，因洋蕃芋是塊莖，圓圓的像煞是個菩薩面孔，所以有人定這種菜，呌「羅漢見彌陀，」也是極便宜極淸爽的吃品。</p>
<p>烙湯西施乳豆腐，確乎是從化學作用，纔能製成，相傳還是漢朝淮南王所發明，直到如今，無論有錢無錢的，都歡喜吃他；故就便那一處地方，倘若是一個市集，豆腐店總不會開不出，因爲價値便宜，而又是適口，並且除了腐外，可以做皮·衣·條·乾·漿·花色最多；和在别種菜裏，都覺得他是極好的輔佐品，豆腐做的時候，從鍋裏傾入缸中，那面上所凝結的固體，這是在上層最精華最白嫩的，呌「豆腐花，價錢雖稍貴，而純潔實在没有可以比得上；如其估湯來吃，眞不下芙蓉蛋，或嫌其性過淡，可用黄豆悶熟後逼出的汁加入，那末：其味遂雋永，像味精等等，反可不用，或再加些榨菜片，能吃辣油，滴下少許，白白的腐面，顯出一顆一顆腥紅的色采來，豈不是又好吃又好看麽？呌他「烙湯西施乳，這個名詞，也算十分相稱。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第三十一回三次交鋒白衣衝雪陣全營殉國赤眼入槍林</p>
<p>趙自强雖然極力的掙扎着，來統率這一連弟兄，但是他也並非銅筋鐵骨，因之在十分忍耐不住的時候，就帶領着這些人，開始跑步起來。先是順着這雪溝裏的大道，突然向山崖上一跑。跑上去之後，復又一口氣跑了回來。跑了這樣兩趟之後，大家身上才發生一點暖氣，雖不能像平常樣，可也免得打抖顫了。於是自强派出四名弟兄去當偵探兵，一面在這夾溝的兩面山坡上，擇好了地勢，各伏好了幾十名兵士，各架着一挺重機關槍，靜等着機會。自强也是心裏很焦燥，敵人不來，弟兄耐着寒冷在這裏靜等，决計是支持不住的。看看太陽西墜，除了西方半邊天，有些慘淡的雲彩而外，天空已經受着淺灰色，在灰色的夜幕裏，略略有兩三點星光，映着白雪堆遍了的地面模糊一片，便說不出來心裏有一種什麽感覺，只是不能十分寗貼。沉思了許久，抬頭看看天上的星光，大小雜亂着，已經分佈满天了。弟兄們蹲着在那避風的雪崖下，誰出不曾放出一聲咳嗽，透出一些鼻息。恰是風也不吹，草木也不響動，彷彿整個宇宙，都停頓了幾分鐘。正這樣靜靜的等着變化到來呢，早見那個派出去的偵探兵，跑了過來，先呌了一聲報告。接着道：單得勝在前山小路口，遇到間諜一名，那間諜不加抵抗，情願就捕。現在崖下。自强道：快帶上來。說時，兩名弟兄，在積雪裏推着一奸細上來。那人到了自强面前，早就跪下了。哭着道：連長，我是中國人，讓敵人逼着來做漢奸的呀！我給你報告，敵人有一營人，要打這裏去攻寨子，快要到了。（四二三）</p>

<p>後人以根據經絡之言。不能適合於傷寒六經之說。於是有脫離十二經脈以言六經者。蓋傷寒傳經。自外入内之說。古人多有言之。至明方中行撰傷寒條辨。爲圖於卷首。以爲陽病在表。自外而内。陰病在裏。自下而上。其說略曰「風寒之著人。人必皮膚當之。皮膚在軀殼之外。故曰表。表合太陽足膀胱經。合者何。膀胱開竅於前。前者表陽之道。故合也。言太陽而不言膀胱經與皮膚者。不待言而可知也。然太陽猶有手小腸經。安知所言非此乎。小腸經不與皮膚合。不合則不主病。不主病則不足言。不足言則不在言内。亦可知也。」此以太陽爲軀殼最外層之皮膚。而牽膀胱經以合之。膀胱皮膚。無從牽合。乃以開竅於前爲說。然則眼鼻口生殖器。皆開竅於前者。皆得爲太陽矣。其牽强附會如此。又旣以膀胱附會於皮膚。於是遂謂小腸經不與皮膚合。故不在言内。以是爲傷寒傳足不傳手之理。眞專横驕恣。指揮自適矣。</p>
<p>方氏又曰「陽明者。風寒之邪。過皮膚而又進。接皮膚者。肌肉也。不曰肌肉。而曰陽明者。肌肉居五合之中。爲軀殼之正。内與陽明足胃合也。合謂何。胃亦中。爲五臟六腑之海。合内外之正。以正合正也。故又曰正陽。然則陽明雖有二經。其手大腸經不與肌肉合。不在言内。而所言者爲胃經。可知也。」此以陽明爲表之中層。以肌肉當之。牽合於足陽明胃脈。胃與肌肉。無從牽合。則以居中爲說。其牽强附會又如此。</p>
<p>方氏又曰。「少陽者。邪過肌肉而又進。則又到軀殼之肉。腑臟之外。所謂半表半裏者。少陽足膽經之合也。合者何。膽不自立。粘連於肝而不離。與外不屬軀殼而不離軀殼。内不屬腑臟而不離腑臟者。同道。故合也。」此以少陽爲軀殼之内腑臟之外。而以足少陽膽牽合之。以不膽自立。粘連於肝而不離爲說。其牽强附會又如此。</p>
<p>方氏又曰「太陰。脾也。脾居中而主事。故次少陽。而爲三陰之先受。少陰。腎也。厥陰。肝也。陰道逆。主下。故肝雖近而居上。脾腎雖遠而居下。腎反次脾受。肝最後受。陰道自下而上逆。固如此。」方氏旣以陰病爲自下而上。而又以脾居中位。不合其自下而上之論。則又以居中主事爲說。眞可謂之任所欲爲者矣。</p>
<p>方氏又曰。「心肺何以不受哉。靈樞曰。心爲人一身之主。不受外邪以不受外邪。故位高而居上。肺主出不受納。故最高而極上。」此以心肺不受邪。爲傷寒不傳手三陰之理。自今言之。心肺受外邪之病甚多。鑿鑿可據。且古未有言肺不受邪者。横謂之位高居上。不受外邪。以附會不傳手之說。其妄甚矣　　其繼方氏辨專言足亦經不言手經者。爲魏荔彤傷寒論本義。其略曰。「足太陽膀胱。其經行身之背。初感風邪。多感於背爲足太陽之經分故病邪在是。治亦在是。况足太陽主皮膚。如天之無不包。且不止行身後也。若手太陽小腸。非病邪所及。故不必治也。」此以太陽行於身後。乃襲經絡之舊言。而又以太陽主皮膚。則又用方氏之說矣。兼容並畜。欲以鞏固其說。不擇事之可憑言之可徴者。以爲之基礎。專掇拾其可以便吾之說者。穿鑿附會以充奥援。是東郭乞食之齊人。恐不能饜足。又顧而之他之術出。焉往而不得醉飽乎哉。然爲學如此。其不爲家人所訕笑者鮮矣。</p>
<h3>談談多汗症和狐臭</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>炎夏已屆。溽暑蒸人。吾人遂不禁有揮汗如雨之苦。一般患多汗症的病人。更覺難堪。患狐臭的人。尤倍學痛苦。爰述多汗症和狐臭。</p>
<p>（一）汗從那裏來的吾人的皮膚。可以分做三層。第一層呌做表皮。第二層呌做眞皮。第三層呌做皮下組織。詳細已在本刋「皮膚病常識」中叙過。汗腺就是在第二層眞皮當中的一種管狀腺。也可以分做三部。就是汗腺體，排泄管，和管孔。汗腺管壁的裏面。有一種細胞。汗液就是從腺細胞分泌出來的。經過排泄管。從管孔達到皮膚的表面。吾人全身的皮膚。除了龜頭和包皮内面以外。都有汗腺。汗腺的多少。各部分不同。最多要算手掌。，足蹠？前額，鼻翼，額，腋窩等部分。</p>
<p>（二）汗液的成分和分泌量</p>
<p>汗爲一種水樣透明的液體。味鹹帶不快的臭氣。呈酸性反應。倘是分泌過多的時候。那就呈鹻性反應了。有百分之一的固形物質。和百分之九十九的水分。此固形物質中。有食鹽，鉀，硫酸，硫酸鹽類，燐酸鹽，尿素，尿酸，脂肪酸等等。倘發汗强烈的時候。尿素的排泄很多。皮膚表面。就有砂樣物質附著。汗腺不但分泌上面所講的種種物質。同時還能排泄藥物和細菌。例如臭素，碘劑，砒劑，水銀，硫黄，酒精，阿片，吐根等。</p>
<p>講到發汗的分量。很不一定。就是因個人的差異，外界的温度和身體部位的不同。大有差異。世人大多僅僅知道夏委裏有發汗。實則吾人的皮膚。無時無刻不排泄汗液。不過排泄的分量很少。變成氣體。難以目擊罷了。據大氏（Daries)報告。普通一畫夜間。汗的分泌約有一千三百ＣＣ倘是勞働的時候。在一小時能够分泌四千六百ＣＣ那就有八九磅之多。眞是大汗淋漓了。</p>
<p>（三）發汗的目的發汗的目的有兩種。一種是調節體温。吾人身體當安靜的時候。體温並不過高。發汗稀少。倘是運動或是炎夏的時候。體温升騰。發汗就特别加多起來。這是什麽緣故呢。原來從物理學上的原則講起來。凡是液體變成氣體。必定需要温度。現在因爲體温升騰。就利用汗的蒸發。來奪取體温。使人們不至十分覺熱。所以吾人當大汗之後。體温能够降低。這就是發汗的體温調節作用。醫師對於發熱病人。用發汗療法。也就是這個道理。肥胖的人。當氣温升騰的時候。比較普通的人。容易怕熱。並且多汁。就是因爲他的皮下脂肪層過厚。不能把體温充分發散。所以怕熱。要想把體温多於散些。所以出汗。發汗第二種目的。是代物腎臟的機能。原來吾人身體中的老廢物。和水分。從腎臟中排泄出去。倘使腎臟有疾病的時候。尿的排泄不充分。就可以發生危險的病症。這個時候。醫師可以用發汗療法。譬如内服藥物或是用物理學的療法。令病人發汗。來氏表腎臟排泄有害的老廢物和水分。就是在平時發多的時候。尿量也减少。這是吾人日常所經騐的事實。</p>
<p>（四）怎樣的呌做多汗症和多</p>
<p>汗症的分類所謂多汗症　　就是汗腺的分泌過多。同時大多和其他的疾病併發。或是因其他的疾病。繼續發生本病的。講到多汗症的種類。可以分做兩種。一種呌做全身性多汗症。一種呌做局部性多汗症。</p>
<p>（五）全身性多汗症的症候和</p>
<p>原因講到全身的多汗症。譬如勞働和炎夏時候的汗水淋漓。肥胖病人的出汗如雨。羞恥驚恐時候的冷汗浹背。勝敗有關時候的冷汗一握。這都可以屬於生理的範圍。但是貧血纖弱的人。容易出汗。那就近於病理的了。此外婦女的月經期，絕經期，神經衰弱等的人。往往容易發生全身性多汗症。此外熱性病人退熱時候的發汗。呌做分利的發汗。重症肺結核病人的夜汗。呌做盜汗。虚脫病人的冷汗，呌做虚脫汗。這也是屬於全身性多汗症。</p>
<p>（六）局處多汗症的症候和原</p>
<p>因局處性多汗症。還可以分做偏側性多汗症，和對側的多汗症。偏側性多汗症。就是發汗常常偏于一側。或者一側的出汗。比較他側特别多。這在健康的人。服了刺戟性食物以後。往往見之。也有因交感神經麻痺性偏頭痛，頭部交感神經的外傷，三叉神經痛後，頭神經痛，肋間神經痛，腰神經痛，和腦脊髓的疾病。發生偏側性多汗症。</p>
<p>局處性多汗症。大多是對側性的。發生于手掌和足蹠。陰汗，腋汗也不少。</p>
<p>患脚汗的人。不但汗液濕潤。往往因汗液的分解。發生着惡臭。皮膚角層呈白色的澎大。趾和趾的中間。發生水疱。皸裂。因爲痒的關係。甚至妨害睡眠。搔破以後。又發生疼痛。難以步行。所以夏季裏汗多的時候。更覺難堪。這樣病人的足部。大多帶濕而冷。呈靑紫色的狀態。在冬季裏。還容易發生凍瘡。</p>
<p>手汗多的人。他的手掌。常常有汗液的濕潤。手的靑紫色和冷。也和患脚汗的人一樣。此一則因血液的運動微弱。二則因汗水蒸發奪去局所温度的緣故。患手汗的人。大多是屬于少年。尤以神經衰弱和貧血的人最多。</p>
<p>局處性多汗症。除手汗脚汗以外。陰部。腋窩。肛門周圍，乳房下面。頸部皺裂等部。也都可以發生多汗症。同時因爲兩部的皮膚。互相摩擦。惹起皮膚的潮紅，濕潤，瘙痒，灼熱，疼痛等皮膚炎的症狀。病人就覺那多汗症的苦惱。</p>
<p>（七）多汗症的治療法講到多汗症的治療。明白了上面所講的原因。自然不能以局部的治療爲满足。現在可以分作兩種來講。第一種是全身的療法。因爲上面所講多汗症的原因中。有貧血。虚弱和神經衰弱等等。那一定要把原病來根本治療。方才可以把多汗症醫</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>治好來。所以全身療法中。就有冷水摩擦、海水浴，温泉浴，砒鐵等的强壯劑。都不可少的了。至於對症的療法。可以給與麻痺汗神經的藥劑。譬如「阿刀品」等。那要醫師的處方了。</p>
<p>第二種是局部的治療。上面所講全身的療法。就是原因的治療。但是並非倉卒間可以奏效的事情。所以同時要施行局部法治療。局部治療的方法很多。可以分做理學療法和藥物療法。理學療法譬如水銀石英燈和愛克司光的照射。很有功效。藥物的療法。有用藥劑的。有用水劑的。有用軟膏劑的。有用塗布劑的。所用的藥物也很多。譬如水楊酸，硼酸，「單拿妨」「福而買林」「抱水格魯拉爾」等等。</p>
<p>（八）局部性多汗症的攝生</p>
<p>上面所講的治療方法。須經過醫師的手。但是自己的攝生。也不可少。譬如患部應當保守淸潔。時常用明礬水洗滌。襪子鞋子。常宜勤換。或用絲瓜絡放入襪底内。趾和趾之間。放些紗布。都可以吸收汗液。可以預防汗水分解後所發生的皮膚炎。</p>
<p>（九）怎樣的呌做狐臭原來汗水分解的時候。多少有點臭氣。俗呌做汗臭。平時足汗多而且襪子華子不肯勤換的人。因爲汗液的分解腐敗。方才發生臭氣。倘是新鮮的發汗。就有臭氣。那就呌做臭汗。最多發生的地方是腋窩。所以就有腋臭和狐臭的專門名稱了。黑奴的汗腋。含有脂肪酸很多。所以常常發生腐敗牛酪樣的臭氣。白色人種也常有一種固有的腋臭。俗呌做洋骚臭。吾國患腋臭的人。還不很多。</p>
<p>患腋臭的人。當冬季汗液分泌少的時候。還不甚覺得。等到氣候炎熱或是精神感動。飲酒等以後，汗腺的分泌旺盛。那腋臭就特别加甚。對于社交上。覺到種種的不便。年輕的夫婦。竟有因此釀成離婚的不幸。所以患腋臭的人。精神上很是痛苦。</p>
<p>（十）狐臭症的療法第一應當保持淸潔。就是勤於洗浴。局部用水楊酸酒精，薄荷酒精等塗布。但是大多不能斷根。要想汗腺組織的萎縮。可以用愛克司光或雷錠的照射。也須反覆施行。至於最頑固的狐臭。最好把腋窩部的皮膚切除。汗腺就被連帶的除去。就没有狐臭的痛苦。</p>
<p>（十一）色汗症怎麽呌做色汗症。就是病人所分泌的汗液中。帶黄紅，靑、綠，黑等顏色。他的原因。現在還不十分明瞭。有人講汗液中混有化學的物質。也有人講汗液中混有產生色素的細菌。大多神經質的爲多。</p>
<h3>上海市衛生戒嚴令和夏令防病衛生</h3>
<p>— 黄貽淸</p>
<p>（六月二十一日下午四時在上海中西播音電台講）</p>
<p>上海市第十三屆衛生運動會所下衛生戒嚴令括下列五個中心警戒事項：</p>
<p>㈠吐痰須吐安全地</p>
<p>㈡小便必上厠所</p>
<p>㈢垃圾必傾倒入垃圾桶内</p>
<p>㈣飲水必飲沸水</p>
<p>㈤接受防疫法射</p>
<p>剛才朱恒璧先生因爲有要事，不能來演講，呌貽淸來替他和大家談談：</p>
<p>夏天挺容易傳到的傳染病，像霍亂，赤痢，夏委腹瀉等等，都是因爲飯食不愼，從嘴裏吃到這些病的致病菌，方發生的。研究衛生的人，稱牠做糞傳病。因爲牠傳染的來源都也於糞：都出於害那許多病的病人底糞。這些病菌傳到飲食物的來路，不外「水」和「空」兩個途徑。水道就是河裏，井裏的生水；藉以航空而來的，就是那「菌用飛機」般的蒼蠅。咱們偶或喝到含病菌的水。吃到染病菌的食物，身體强健的人或者還可以抵抗一下，假如身體並不十分健，那簡直無抵抗地病了，病了一程，甚或死了。所以咱們爲預防受染打算，最好就没有進口的飲食上，做個對病菌戒嚴的工作。這種工作，說難不難，說易也却不易，歸根一句，將在處置生水和蒼蠅。關於處置生水一層，在上海，是很幸運的，大多數住户都已經能够喝到了自來、水、靠水廠裏細菌的，物理的，化學的種種作用，已經可以把生水裏所含一切的細菌，殺死了百分之九十八九、還有一些没有殺死的，無論牠是不是糞傳病菌，咱們可以再把牠煮沸一下，規定非開過的水不喝，藉熱力把賸餘細菌一概殺死。同時，推廣熱力的效用，規定飯食統通趁熱就吃，免得料理了好久，停滞在那兒，等牠冷却了給蒼蠅爬過，叮過了才吃，仍舊免不了要染到那病菌。乃至洗果品，洗食器，也規定至少用冷開水，最好非用沸水不可。對於一切生冷物品，除去新出冰箱的冰凍物，自然免開尊口。果眞天天如此，步步留神，便可絕對不致染到什麽糞傳病。在内地，没有自來水的去處，却只有靠沸煮飲水等等利用熱力的土法。不過靠土法，利用熱力，也自可保險。這是這次上海市衛生戒嚴令第四條把「飲水必飲沸煮水」做宣傳中心的精義。</p>
<p>剛才說的，夏天挺容易流行的幾種傳染病都從糞便傳出。分明講究起衛生來，若是把糞便處理的好，傳染病的來源也得塞住了。所以咱們的大小便，挺不該隨便「拆濫汚」，一定要上厠所「出恭」才行。上了厠所，假如用的是水冲厠（抽水馬桶）牠自然會得從糞管裏流入糞塲，經過細菌的，化學的種種作用，把糞裏所含一切的細菌殺死，糞水流入河流，不致再傳播疾病的了。卽使用的是馬桶，那糞給夫役運到鄕間，貯存糞坑裏，過着一二個月，那許多病菌也自然會得給各種腐敗細菌淘汰掉，殱滅凈盡，不致死恢復燃地傳出活病菌來發生疫病了。這是戒嚴令第二條犯「小便必</p>
<p>上厠所估宣傳中心的精義。講小便，不講大便，乃是因爲小便已能自己規定必上厠所，大便那更不消說得了呀！</p>
<p>至於戒嚴令第三條，「垃圾必須傾倒入垃圾箱，跟夏令預防傳染病挺有關係的一點，就是垃圾假如隨地濫攤着，便容易惹蒼蠅的麕集。接近了蒼蠅，容易使飲食受到蒼蠅的沾染。濫攤着有碍觀瞻，還是小事。倒入了垃圾桶，把牠蓋緊了。堅壁淸野地對壘着，蒼蠅也總可减少一些哩。第四條「吐痰須吐的穩妥」，本是預防結核病（癆病）的中心信條。講起他最切近時令的衛生底關係，假如隨地是痰，蒼蠅也總特多。痰本來最好吐在紙杯裏，隨時把他燒掉。等而下之，才用有蓋的痰盂。假如咱們的居處不隨地吐痰，當然也可少却一種引誘蒼蠅的東西。這是大家知道的。</p>
<p>綜合起来，假如咱們拉的糞處理的好，喝的水處理的好，垃圾和痰吐的環境處理的好，糞傳病病菌侵入咱們嘴和腸道的機會，也自漸漸地少却。咱們過着夏天的生活，也自可優哉遊哉地講究一些衛生的道理了。</p>
<p>照上面說的，整頓了環境，戒絕了生冷，再進一步，爲個人安全着想，各人還須得各自請妥了抵抗病菌的侵襲的「鏣客」丨丨就是戒嚴令第五條「接受防疫注射」，打防疫針。打了防疫針，身體裏就會發生一種抵抗菌毒的物質。把萬一侵入身體的病函尅制掉，不致發病：打了霍亂預防針，便卽使受霍亂菌的傳染，也不致發霍亂病。打了傷寒和甲乙兩種副傷寒預防針，便卽使受傷寒菌或副傷塞菌的傳染，也不致發傷寒和副傷寒病。尤妙，在近年都使用霍亂，傷寒，副傷寒的混合菌苗，打了一次，便可靠着身體發生的力量，防備幾種病菌的侵擾。這實際要比請鏣客，靠旁人保鏣還妙啦。</p>
<p>這上海市的衛生戒嚴令，固然不單爲夏令防病衛生着想，但單就和夏令防病衛生的關係說，也可見得方式雖是「戒嚴」着，骨子裏却藴藏着一副慈悲的菩薩心腸，無非想給大家納入抗疫，保健的康莊大道吧了。在千頭萬緒的衛生條規中，虧他們想出這些淺近易行的五個綱要，來做初步的律令的條文。希望大家接受着，切切實實地做到他！</p>

<h3>人參（四）</h3>
<p>— 趙燆黄</p>
<p>釜上加陶製之甑，口徑二尺一寸，高一尺八寸，底徑一尺七寸，底部有多數之孔甑中架以樹枝，排列入參於其上，閉蓋而蒸。其初加水於釜，漸次加熱至煮沸。沸騰後之火力，務必維持其原狀，以一時半至二時爲度。此際其沸騰之湯，若直接接觸其根，則製品變爲黑棕色，而其品質遂不免遜色。因之釜湯與根莖之間，須加布一層，可以防之。或不取樹枝，改用蒸籠密閉蒸煮，蒸至適當之時，擴於筵席上，冷却之後，置焙爐上，以四五日焙乾，則得美麗之紅參。朝鮮人參以紅者爲貴，國產吉林人參適相反，以白者爲貴，紅者次之。　　生曬人參不加調製，卽將出土之參，不去栓皮之鬚根。再三洗刷，去凈泥土。繫以長綫，懸於空中而暴乾。色灰而微黄色是也。</p>
<h3>參類之分支槪况及定價法則</h3>
<p>吉林遼寗參及在吾國銷行之高麗參，其分支法，至四支數爲十支參，至多支數爲四十支參。而更以十五支，二十支，二十四支，三十支，四十支，五種爲最多。分支之數愈少，而各參之形體愈大，與日本分片之數，同一意義也。每種均分天地等字號。至於參上剪下之物，統名爲參鬚。然參業中人，因其大小，更别六等，如參條，大尾，中尾，夾尾，細尾，末尾，等名稱是也。而上海市上，近年到貨，在高麗參中，以細尾夾尾兩種爲多。寗吉人參，大槪分家參野參兩種，家參之分支，與分别參鬚名稱，全與高麗參同。惟野參貨少價昻，除少數參商將其末尾剪下，另行作價出售外。普通均留原狀不事分開。每根以重五六兩爲上等，三四兩爲中等，一二兩次之。其餘則不貴重矣。眞正老山六兩參，每根値銀二千元，五兩參，値銀三百元，一兩參値銀一百五十元，棟選參，每兩値銀由八十元至十八元不等，普通參由三十元至六十元不等，遼東太子參，由二十二元至二十五元，老山移參，由十元至十八元，冲山野參，由四元至六元，老栽野參，由二元至三元，最普通者，由二角至一元，白値參鬚，由六角至二元，紅直參鬚，由六角至八角，紅白丁彎參鬚，約五六角云。</p>
<p>日本及朝鮮產白參與紅參亦以形體大者爲貴，用二十片三十片等名稱，以别其品位及價格，是對於一斤之個數而言。凡在紅參，普通以五十片爲最小，大五十片以下之物，則不調製之。然白參在百片以上者亦不少。</p>
<h3>應用</h3>
<p>人參專爲强壯藥。應用於神經衰弱，歇斯的里，其他一</p>
<p>般衰弱患者。又爲利尿劑。一回用量一至五公分。作爲煎劑或爲浸膏而用之。　　「附」藥肆中有所謂鬚人參（參鬚）者乃集枝根及主根細長部，而乾燥之物。其氣味及含有成分，無異於白參。花旗參AmericanGinseng者乃自美國輸入，爲PanaxquinquifoliaL(a.gr)之根，產於北美東部，森林蔭深之山中。所含成分與上述者相同。應用與吉林人參同。（完）</p>

<h3>論重譯及其他</h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>英美文學，法文學，日本文學，須要直接繙譯，而德文學，直接繙譯，也不是絕對地作不到。如郁達夫先生，魯迅先生等等能繙譯德文學的人，也是相當地存在着的。我覺得只有西，意波等以及諸弱小民族的文學，是没辦法的，須要間接譯出。不過，我以爲，如果可能意西諸國主要宜根據法文，波蘭諸國主要宜根據德文。而間接地去譯，詩與其根據英文譯本，還是根據法日諸國的譯本好些。因爲英國譯詩，是重格律，而法日，是重内容。我们不能無條件地說一切書都可以間接繙譯，我們自然也不能說須去等待着直接繙譯。一切問題，是要附以條件的。我們不能不附條件地這樣或那樣地作。</p>
<p>自然，直接繙譯，有時，會比間接繙譯壞得多。如「我的大學」，據說是直接繙擇，可是，比較間接譯出來的（參照英日法三種譯本的產物）「胆怯的人」據說，是不如。張競生博士譯的　骚：「懺悔錄」，頭一句就不對，而潘會文先生譯的「蟹工船」也是第一句就有點問題。但這不能說是因爲他們直接地繙譯所以不好，而是因爲他們的知識與理解的問題。如果使他們以法文或日本文間接地繙譯，也不見得繙得好。我以爲，在譯一篇作品之前，第一，是譯者要對於作品有理解和認識。我們是不能把作者對於作品的認識抛開，去單獨地論間接繙譯或直接繙譯的。</p>
<p>如對於一篇作品，無相當的理解，不管他是直接繙譯也好，或是間接繙譯也好，總是不行的。對於作品的認識，不是無研究工夫就能獲到的。那麽，譯文學時，至少須對之有點研究的這樣一來，直接譯更是要肯定的了，幷且，我們的作品繙譯，幷不是要知道一點故事，而是在作家的世界觀人生觀之外，更見到他們的表現方法。如紀德，朱易土，普魯斯特，馬雅珂夫斯基，梅特林等等，間接譯是有危險的。原來作品，很難譯得出來，也恐怕不止是「去之毫厘差之千里」的。我以爲善長於英文者，與其說譯記得，還是多譯些美國作品或轉譯些只有依據英文譯本而始得介紹過來的法國作品。而且，DotPasos,Hemmingway,Duiser,Auderson諸人的作品，比紀得的東西，對中國，還有益處些。紀得的作品，直接地去譯尙</p>
<p>爲不易，間接地去譯，一定弄不大好的。</p>
<p>現在文壇中，需要人大大地作繙譯工作。我們作繙譯時，須有權變的辦法，但是，一勞永逸的辦法，也是不能忽視的。我們在不得已的條件下自然是要容許，甚且要求間接繙譯，但是，我們也要防止那些阻碍眞實的直接繙譯本的間接譯出的劣貨。而對作品之了解，是繙譯時的先决條件。作品中的表現方式也是要注意的。能「一勞永逸」時，最好是想「一勞逸」的辦法。無深解的買辦式的繙譯是不得許可的。</p>
<p>關於繙譯文學可討論的問題甚多，希望忠實的文學者多多發表些意見，看見史賁先生的「論重譯」，使我不得不發表出來以上的意見，以釋其誤會。</p>
<h3>平頭論</h3>
<p>— 玄元</p>
<p>國人有一種最壞的脾氣，就是砍頭，「口誅筆伐」這種字樣，有時要使懦夫喪氣。其砍之的原因呢？因爲那頸子太長的緣故！</p>
<p>凡武人，政客，文人，學者，手下口邊，往</p>
<p>往不離一種誅戮的雄風，有刀子而殺人是不足怪的；可怪的是一班無刀子而想斫人頭的人們，或有心無胆，或有胆無力，只企圖着大家去殺戮不合已意的人們，踐死他們，而自己不負</p>
<p>罪名。</p>
<p>於是乎天下紛紛，事情就不簡單起來了。在這種紛紛攘攘中，大家的習慣是將頭低到不能再低，將頸項縮的不能再縮短。有誰「出頭」的，大家就合力平掉他，譏笑他，引爲深戒。</p>
<p>只看最近「大衆語」問題，就知道各個角落里</p>
<p>閃耀着什麽眼睛的光芒，什麽種心在緊張了。自由發展麽，違背了階級性呀！近於「文言」了麽，没落的掙扎呀！再寫下去呢，就眞是時代的反動者呀，····總之是可恨的。</p>
<p>範圍呢，琥弄越小，小到一個針尖的地位也没有了，我們的批評家還在不平：這上面到底可站立若干天使呢？而持論亦復熱昏了。林語堂喜歡「白話之文」或「文言之白」，不行，他不該那麽「喜歡」，應該羣起而攻之的。</p>
<p>其實這種討巧而不想出力的方法何嘗會生效</p>
<p>？古今中外昻起頭來的人們不終於是昻起頭來了麽？有人說每一種敵愾是一種硬領，可以使頭支持，不至於低下去，倒是昻着頭在低着的頭上踏過去了，却可恨的！</p>

<p>— 任達泉</p>
<p>天還黑沉沉的只有幾顆有細小亮光的疎星，鷄已啼了二遍，約摸是午夜二點鐘的時光。壽寳懶佯佯地伸了個哈欠，一各落的爬起，揉了揉眼，直着喉嚨問：</p>
<p>「媽，好走起不？」</p>
<p>「讓我先起來燒水吧，」媽在隔壁房裏答。「你稍爲再睡丨</p>

<p>媽在悉速悉速的穿衣，又啊　啊𠳾地在咳嗽，壽寳再也睡不着，心裏默默的想：</p>
<p>田要耘，工夫呢眞掉不轉，今好不容易的呌生福小四倆幇一工；忙工時節多少總須買點肉，已有半個多月不買葷腥，稍多買點，讓媽也得吃一塊。還有酒，烟，素菜，准要一塊大洋，工錢只好暫欠一欠，而田呢，統只有四畝幾分，收成好成好不做荒年，去了租米，至過二擔多米，一年的吃用靠二擔米怎够，倘然荒呢···　　想到今年收穫若再加個折扣時，壽寳不禁呆呆地頓住想不下去。</p>
<p>實在的春上頭一年一靠的春蠶，辛苦了一個半月，得到的結果還不够回鎭上重利借來的蠶本；自己培栽的桑葉，只好白白的吃了，這重大的打擊，使那别無生產的壽寳怎受得下</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>「這可怎麽辦？」他猛力的拍了一下牀沿。</p>
<p>·········</p>
<p>黑暗裏，只能看見一迷糊的輪郭，靜靜的只有撥動靑苗的聲音。頭上戴着那個防給苗秧割開臉的竹圈，直怪不適意的。</p>
<p>脚膝跪在爛泥裏，一點一點的爬去，手，臂膊，當器械用：塗抹倒那苗秧邊的雜草，背傴倒着好久，可眞酸疼得當不</p>

<p>光照在背上，眞要晒起泡。</p>
<p>現在天已白茫茫的，東邊遠遠山巒裏已有一絲絲的紅光放出，四週的景物，已漸漸地看得淸楚，他的生活也已完成大半。</p>
<p>『呵！歇歇吧！小四。』生福伸了個懶腰摸了摸脚膝頭。</p>
<p>『生活也快完咧！』小四立起身，望了望已耘過的田。</p>
<p>『唔！是該歇歇了。』壽寳也伸了伸腰。</p>
<p>拖着满是泥水的脚，載着疲敝的身子，一坐倒田埂上，本能地都喊出一聲：『唉，吃力得來！』</p>
<p>壽寳摸出昨日鎭上賒來的香烟，分給生福小四各一支。用火柴燃點着，暫時舒適地看那</p>
<p>縷縷的烟氣，冉冉地出來。　　『鎭上楊老頭的頭你有没有給他淸？』生福吐了口烟問壽寳。</p>
<p>『怎麽不，這是蠶本啊，倘不回淸，來年怎麽辦？你呢？』</p>
<p>『我麽！』生福笑了笑。『本是想回他，同他商量，懇求他利錢稍爲讓一點，少算一個月，他媽的，一個也不肯少，所</p>
<p>以索興不給，看他怎樣！』</p>
<p>『楊老頭實也太凶，借時即使已過月半，他仍要算一個月利錢，而問他借的呢，都等着用，只得吃虧點。』小四也加入說。『並且我聽人說，他的錢一半也向城裏錢莊上借來，利錢不到一分，只一過手，而</p>
<p>我們問他借呢唉！·········』</p>
<p>『不過，生福你不回總不是</p>

<p>『道理，管它呢！倘若今年田裏收成不大好，錢一回光，</p>

<h3>微雨又黄昏</h3>
<p>— 系舟</p>
<p>丨雨後中山園一夕記丨</p>
<p>一天悶熱，到下午又佈满了烏雲。</p>
<p>迄晚，稀疏地落了一陣細雨，微雨又黄昏，已經够有詩意的了，宇宙是無邊的靜，一身是無限的輕，因爲怕在斗室裏糟塌了一個難得的黄昏，邀小禾到中山公園去。</p>
<p>今夜的中山公園，竟是爲我一個人特設的了，平昔熙來攘往的盡是人頭，肥或瘦，高和矮，市井氣與方巾氣的男人，妥臀細腰，赤足露腿的摩登伽女，一陣細雨，這些人都歛迹了，世界是無邊的靜，靜。</p>
<p>靜默中市囂也沈寂了，往常，尤其是黄昏時候，中山公園外的柏油路上，車水馬龍，只聽見呌囂與喧亂，於今，却什麽也靜了下去，縱然有汽車駛過，電車運行，那聲音，只一刷，竟是空寂裏的鈞天妙樂。</p>
<p>更不知是那方傳來一聲淸罄，兩響疏鐘。我瑟縮了一下，似乎是寒慄，是的，靜夜聞鐘，不寒而慄，何况雨後的黄昏，正是薄寒中人的時候。</p>
<p>順着卍字廊，走到鶴池畔，望着對面水榭綠陰深處的一盞燈火，我失神地呀的呌了一聲。這絕景我幾曾領略過？我不能描寫那盞燈是怎樣地吸引我的贊美，我只能告訴你那盞燈的神秘處：石砌下泛着流水，水面上浮着幾葉新荷，亂石堆成一個小山，山邊幾顆樹，不稀不密的樹葉作成一片綠蔭，綠蔭裏一盞燈；雨洗過的樹葉映着燈光作嫩綠色，嬌翠欲滴，正好是這叢綠葉的形容；燈光穿過綠葉叢裏反射在出水芙蓉的新葉上，一粒兩粒的白水珠，珍珠樣的流着；荷葉下不時有雨聲小響，那是遊魚出水來享受這神秘的黄昏。</p>
<p>園後，是古柏林的荷池。我們故意從没有燈光的古柏下穿行，一股難於言說的韾香，隨着縷縷的微風，撲進我們的鼻孔。我昻着頭走丨我幾曾這樣高視闊步的走過幾步呢？丨天空是一片深藍，藍海中嵌着幾顆星星，夜是靜的，天也是靜的，星星作了靜世界的小主人丨我舒暢地呼吸了幾口氣。</p>
<p>踱到池邊，倚欄而立。光着眼睛看，看不見什麽，只一片朦朧，遠處有些糢糊的黑影，張着耳聽，聽不見什麽，只遠處雨聲疏鐘，水中幾聲魚躍。我們死死地呆站着，彼此不說一句話，這時我是没有任何意識了，小禾，他也不則一聲，他該别有一段撩人的記憶來打擾他吧？</p>
<p>夜深，我們又幽幽地踱出園門，脚步隨着脚步，步聲代替了一切我們的思</p>
<p>想與言說。</p>
<p>，無邊的靜，微雨又黄昏！</p>

<p>爲着此，打定主意離開廣州。</p>
<p>什麽東西都弄妥時，天弔涙了。人說落雨天留客，心裏怪焦急的。挨過一分一分的時光，快要到非起身不可的時刻了，而雨呢，還在滴淅。心頭紛亂起來丨丨可是，再等一刻却朗了</p>
<p>，接着連那絲絲細雨也告終止。朋友們說一聲「巧」，兩個送我的朋友忙催我作速向火車站跑。</p>

<p>噹噹！丨丨嗚嗚！</p>
<p>車站上傳來了噹噹的鐘音，火車也回應數聲嗚嗚。</p>
<p>口裏說着「朋友，再會」，又再一度熱的握手，不能不退上車上了。</p>

<h3>&lt;刋L]每逢星期一日出版第七十九期　禾稼蟊賊之蝗蟲　蝗患之預測</h3>
<p>— 天任</p>
<p>蝗患螟災，爲我國農業上之重要問題。</p>
<p>其危險性，猶肺結核，虎列拉之與人體也。一旦暴發，不可收拾，若稍事頂防，亦能减殺其災害於無形。但此等虫災，非每年所常有，尤以蝗患爲然。古人陳芳生陸曾禹兩氏述自春秋至明代，蝗患之見於史册者，有一百十一次。凡此蝗患猖獗年度，名之曰蝗時。由是觀之，蝗患之有定時明矣。蝗患雖有定時，但觀諸過去事實，其發生亦多出入。是槪由乎氣候影響所致，因氣候關係複雜，每年每地不能盡同。因是蝗患之預測工作極難，此項工作</p>
<p>則尤爲必要也。</p>
<p>蝗患之盛衰，旣依氣候爲轉移。故影響於蝗虫大發生之氣候及其性質，須詳爲調查，方得略行預測之工作。一方蝗患之發生，槪有一定之發源地帶，此項地帶，在我國知之頗旱。其學說固不待近代蝗虫大家尤佛祿氏（Uvarov）發表產　原產地學說而後始能知之也。明徐光啟除蝗疏云：「蝗之所生，必於大澤之涯，····驟盈驟涸之處，如幽涿以南，長淮以北，靑袞以西，梁宋以東諸郡，湖漅廣衍，膜溢無常，謂之涸澤，蝗則生之，歷稽蝗代及耳目所睹，記，大都能此，若他地被災，皆所延及，與其傳生者耳」。按此而考我國虫發生地，則爲河北，河南，，山東，山西，江</p>
<p>蘇，安徽陜西，湖北，四川遼寗等省。換言之，其分佈範圍，殆遍佈於華中，華北各地。幅員旣大，氣候自亦不同。在預測蝗患上，如需精確立論，則首先對於此等地帶，非有周密測候設備不可。然此項要求，固不能求之於今日之我國。因此所謂蝗患預測，乃極粗放極初步之估計工作，以大自然之眼光。就一般槪况述其大略而已。</p>
<p>蝗患之預測，最初注意者有Swinton氏。(1833)對於各國蝗虫發生年表與太陽黑點之消長，曾作比較研究。其他一般歐非二洲所產蝗虫之大發生，槪與太陽小黑點之出現期相合符云。Krassilschik（1893）研究飛蝗Locutamigratoria而定出「蝗虫週期律」“Laolcustperiodicity"之學說。謂飛蝗在多腦河口，每隔十二年，在高加索地方，每隔五六年發生一次云。近來Kujagin(1921)用同樣歷史上統計方法，就十八及十九兩世紀之歐洲蝗虫之大發生而研究之，以備未來蝗患之預測矣。但所得爲反對之結果。最近Uvarov(1931)批評其差誤之原因，在乎方法之差誤云云。蓋此等學者，多以某特定種類，在某特定之氣候下所查得之過去週期現象之事實，不分析其不發生之原因，即以之應用於各種生長不同之種類，而推測其將來之發生者，爲事實上不可能之舉也。</p>
<p>氣候之週期律，據Simroth(1008-1909）謂因十一年間太陽黑點所使然。故大多數動物（昆虫在内）數量之變化，亦因此項關係所生云，對於此問題，以後學者，亦多論及。例如粉蝶一種ColiasCroceus爲南歐所產，但在某特定年度，亦能發生於歐洲北部，此項發生年度，槪爲十一年一次云。又天蛾Acherontiaatropos之發生，亦有同一現象。但Meisoner(4909)及Schuster（1909）諸氏，對於Simroth之太陽黑說，頗示反對。Gatow(</p>
<p>1925）就捲葉虫Tortixviridana約二百年間之發生經過而調查之矣，其消長變換期間，與每十七年閒之皐暖及濕冷氣候之變換期略相一致云。又該虫之大發生也，雖與暖期不盡吻合，但大旨則以該期爲發生之中心云。Uvarov(1931)云，沙漠蝗Schistoceroagregaria行大面積之繁殖由Morocco及Senegal向KenyaEgypt,palesline,perfia及北部印度而擴張</p>
<p>猖獗也，爲1915-1916年度時低。最近自1917年起，復行大面積之猖獗。至1930年又未消</p>
<p>滅也。其中間相隔休止時期，約十一年。於此更足述者當1917年低，沙漠蝗肆意猖獗於阿刺伯帶之際，我國之飛蝗Locustamigratotia亦正行猖獗之候也。其間地域雖遙，種類雖異，而猖獗現象則一。由是可知，大自然必存有共同之關係；此共同之關係；影響於地球上一般之生物也。然此項共同性之關係；捨太陽黑點</p>
<p>而外，殆缺完善之解答。</p>
<p>統計過去事實，可知各地各種蝗虫之大</p>
<p>發生，雖有週期現象之表示，但缺一定時期之變化。換言之，此項週期律之變遷，與其說其定期者，不如說其不定期之爲確當也。此項不定期蝗患之誘發因子之探究，乃爲蝗患預測上之基本工作。此等因子，可分爲生物性與非生物性二者論之。所謂生物性因子者，乃指蝗虫之寄生性或捕食性生物之影響而言。非生物性因子，指氣候及氣候所生之生理上生態上各項變化而言也。據最近之研究，知飛蝗大發生之主要關係，由於非生物性因子之影響，此於預測時，尤當注意及之也。</p>
<p>各種生物生長上，對於氣候之關係，均有一種固有之最適狀態。此項最適狀態，特稱曰「生命最適度」Vitaloptimum,,生物生長上所感受之氣候，因其達生命最適度之與否，不特影響於生物之形態，即生理上亦能生至大之差異。據Uvarov(1921)之研究，同種蝗虫，因其產卵發生之地位與年低之不同，其能得最適當之氣候者，則變爲遷移性之飛蝗型，否則轉化爲獨居性之蚱蜢型云。然氣候不特因太陽黑點等大自然之影響而不同，即因地域因年份，亦各有多少差異。此飛蝗發生之年度，所以有週期性之現象，而缺劃一之定期也。Filipjev最近調查俄國飛蝗大發生之年度１９２１－１９２４，爲受旱熱氣候之影響所促成云。並述同樣事實，曾見於１８９１年。此外因熱與乾燥之氣候而發生之蝗患，亦見之於Keppen１８７０）之記載。氏述云「如秋季當蝗虫交配產卵時期，氣候適當，則能延長此等動作之期間，於是所產之卵數，必較冷凉潮濕之秋季爲多」云。此項情形，在蝗虫雖尙無實騐之事實足以證明，但其他昆虫，實例頗多。吾人頗信適當之氣候，能延長蝗虫之產卵可能期間，繼續發育其卵巢卵子，增加其產卵數量也。parker(1929,1930)研究美洲蚱蜢Melanoplusmexicanus之與氣候之關係，曾發見乾燥性食物，能使其發生一種變形，此變形並與擬議爲該種之遷移型之Spretus,Walsh相似云。氏並以圖表示該蚱蜢之大</p>
<p>發生情形，謂每繼續經過乾燥年度三四年而後，則有一度之猖獗云。</p>
<p>我國蝗虫，古代記載頗詳。關於發生力</p>
<p>面，最足注意者，爲大旱與臘雪是也。據徐國棟氏調查浙江縣志虫害記載中飛蝗一節，可知浙江之蝗患，記載最早者爲晋太興二年。（西歷３１９年）至陳永定二年（西歷５５８年）即有旱蝗之記載。兩後凡旱蝗食田禾；浙西旱，大蝗若烟霧蔽天；久旱大蝗；旱疫大蝗；浙西大旱大蝗；江浙大旱蝗；大旱蝗飢；秋旱蝗；大旱飛蝗蔽日；蝗旱且疫；七月旱蝗；蝗飛蔽天；連年旱饑；夏大旱；三月不雨，五月二十八日飛蝗蔽天；夏旱，秋飛蝗　　等等記載，不絕於書。總括此等記載，　有蝗必旱，且以夏旱爲最普通之現象。按諸近年我國之蝗患，亦以旱年爲多，可知旱乃發生飛蝗之主要條件。在我國歷史上固早已知之矣。如就歷年氣候與蝗患相對照，則更易發覺此中關係。今以我國江浙一方爲例，知最近蝗患猖獗年份爲民國十六，十七及十八三年，飛蝗爲害，殆遍於大江南北，並傳入浙西一帶者。去年（二十二年）蝗患情形，亦殆相若。此外在民國十一年，南通曾有少數蝗虫發現。一方根據杭州筧橋自民國八年以來所測氣候，而計算其每年蝗虫生長上最關重要之五六七三個月之降水量時，（參照圖表）發覺此三個月之降水量，約以５００mm爲平均量，乾燥之年，降水量不及此數者，即爲患蝗之徴象。此項影響，早者及於本年，遲者亦能影響於一二年以後之蝗患之發生。去年五六七三個月之降水量僅４００mm許，故去年蝗患亦不算不烈。今年此三個月之降水總量雖尙未及統計，然照過去之五六兩月觀之，固屬大旱之徴象。一方更因去年患蝗之影響，故今年蝗患，至屬堪慮，此所以實業部有七省治蝗會議之召集也。結至目下爲止，各地之報告蝗患者已不一而足，尤足以證明大患之將至，不得不早爲凖備，行未雨綢繆之策也。</p>
<p>上圖爲杭州筧橋民國八年至二十二年止每年五六七三個間之降水量與蝗患發生之關係　　冬季氣候，對於蝗患之發生，亦頗有影響。尤以臘雪之有無早爲我國古人所注意，曾見顧彥著治蝗全法記云：因冬季無雪，乃測蝗患之必至，於是氏乃著書印單，廣爲宜傳治蝗之法，因而蝗患以减，於是乃自號猶白雪齋主人云。亦可知古人對於冬季臘雪重視，而由是以作預測蝗患之基礎也。但按諸實際，冬季氣候與蟲患發生之關係，因蟲而大巽其價値。譬如螟蟲等害蟲，以抵抗氣候較弱之幼蟲越冬者，冬季之低温，影響於其發生者至大。然蝗蟲則以包有極厚之蠟質之卵塊，產諸土中以越冬，對於冬季氣候，具有相當之抵抗力，苟無極度之大寒，影響於卵子之死亡極少。故預測蝗患之發生，與其注重於冬季之氣候，不如以夏季之乾燥高温爲標凖之得策。依最近過去十餘年之經騐而論，江浙之蝗患，固多發生於温暖乾燥之冬季之次年，然凡温暖乾燥之冬季之次年，固非盡罹蝗患之年度也。</p>
<h3>蝗蝻防治法</h3>
<p>— 佈時</p>
<p>中國蝗蟲爲患，由來已久，屢於經傳中見之。詩云，「螽斯羽，詵詵兮宜爾子孫振振兮」，又曰，「去其螟螣，及其蟊賊，無害我田穉，田祖有神，秉　炎火」，螽斯爲蝗蟲之總稱。螣乃其屬名也，蓋蝗蟲之見於古籍者，以此爲最早。傳曰，宣公十五年，冬蝝生，蝝或指未生翅之蝗蟲而言，與　　蝻子，同物異名。秦代受始皇焚書坑儒之影響，關於治蝗之事蹟，未及記載。漢武以還，干戈擾攘，襲單于，平南越，討西夷，征匈奴，戰事頻仍，歲無寗晷，民多棄農入伍，自夏徂秋，蝗害往往遍天下。降及唐代，蝗蟲爲害，史不絕害，其猖獗之程度，固不亞於秦漢，而治之之衛，終未詳及。惟開元四年，山東大蝗，姚崇請分道遣使捕蝗埋之，一時其法大行，是歲所司結奏，捕蝗凡百餘萬擔，爲數至可驚駭，而當時厲行之力，槪可想見。五季之世，後晋天福末年，天下大蝗，連年不解，爰命百姓捕蝗一斗，以粟一斗償之。此外和州志宋天禧元年，高郵州志宋寗宗慶元二年等，均有一部分飛蝗之可考。宋代淳熙之時有勅畫，如蝗蟲初生或飛落後，地方鄰人隱蔽不言，者保不即時中舉撲除者，各杖一百，諸職官妄報盡凈，以遺子次年生發者，皆受杖，足徴蝗害之迫也。至於私家紀述。不勝枚舉，惜皆迹近稗官，令人疑信參十。例如城武縣志，「明萬曆四十五年大旱，蝗蔽天，以捕蝗應格，亦許入　，時謂之蝗生。」定興縣志「崇楨壬子東省及河南等處多大蝗」，其他傳註，尤多怪誔之辭。獨徐光啟有除蝗疏，</p>
<p>言之甚詳，其說徴以近代學理，固未必盡合，而在捕蝗史上亦具相當之價値也。考淸代康熙十一年壬子有蝗不爲衆，咸豐某年五月八日，桐城諸境，飛蝗遍野，民皆以爲神，相戒勿犯，惟事祈禱，時本任巡檢尹高儀目擊其情，心竊傷之，乃出捕蝗要法一書，爲之講說，法雖囿於局部，然亦不無小補也。近歲以來，昆蟲學之進步，逈非昔比，各國研究治蟲之方法，大有日新月異之勢。蝗蟲固農業上之大敵，爲害烈時，大地禾苗，不難立盡，農民仰事俯蓄之資，悉歸烏有，是爲政府當局所應深切注意</p>
<p>者也。茲將其簡單防治方法，分述如左。</p>
<p>㈠開拓荒地丨蝗蟲多發生荒地，凡稍具昆蟲常識者，類能知之，故欲肅淸蝗患，必先從墾荒入手，例如美國落機山在五十年前，一片荒蕪，蝗蟲幾無歲無之，自經開拓之後，乃不復爲災。吾國荒地之面積，占世界各國之第一位，深願政府於高唱復興農村聲中，稍一顧及此種實利政策，將全國荒地，通盤籌劃，實行兵墾制度，則向之仰給於人民者，亦得自食其力。至若人烟稀少而實際上不能種植作物之粗放荒地，則應由政府廣培苗木，實行造林。一年不克就緒，逐年或能推行。務使一國之中無荒土，四境之内無游民，利旣不輕棄於遍野，蝗亦可消滅於無形矣。</p>
<p>㈡掘卵丨掘卵是中國古時重要治蝗方法之一，賢有司每强制民衆執行。凡表土縱起而具許多小洞者，其中每有蝗卵。至今四班牙，南非洲等地，猶泊用此法。掘起之卵子，可充鷄鴨之食料，惟費力多而收效少，是爲缺點。</p>
<p>㈢驅鴨啄食丨用鴨啄食跳蝻，極爲便利。據試騐之結果，每鴨一日能食跳蝻二斤左右。但鴨啄食時，須給以相當淸水，否則易於漲死。故在近水地帶，以鴨治蝻，不特蝗患可除，且鴨易於肥大，誠一舉而兩得也。</p>
<p>㈣掘溝丨掘溝驅蝗，乃我國各省通行之法。發明者爲唐代宰相姚崇氏，至今印度，南美，馬大嘉斯嘉，保嘉利亞，羅馬尼亞，龍耐山，理比亞，比屬康果等處猶沿用之。溝之闊度及深度，隨齡期而定。及個數。據記者試騐之結果，飛蝗第一齡之跳　距離，平均九吋。第二齡十四吋。第三齡二十二吋。第四齡二十六吋。第五齡二十九吋半。掘溝之　度，得依此爲根據。溝之深度，視蝻之多少而異。發生多時，深可三尺左右，通常一二尺足矣。溝之周圍，須成直角。如土質堅實，得掘成上狹下寛之銳角，則收效更宏。溝之四壁應平滑，使蝻不能跳過。每隔一二丈，再掘子溝一。掘起这泥土，堆於蝗蝻趨向之一側，溝之全部，宜正對蝻陣進行之方向。溝成後，驅蝗之人，排列成隊，用掃帚或樹枝順蝗蝻之方向緩步進行，驅蝻入溝，俟子溝充满以後，用土埋之。</p>
<p>㈤水面噴射火油丨此法係前江蘇省昆虫局所發明。現在應用之地方不少。即於蝗蝻經過小河或水溝時，在水面上噴射一層極薄之火油。使蝻渡水後，均窒息而死，收效甚大。</p>
<p>㈥　打丨　打亦係中國古代治蝗方法之一，阿琴丁，南非洲等處亦曾用之。在　打之前，須勘定蝗蝻集中地點，所有人伕山蝻羣四圍齊執掃帚，隨行隨擊，惟費人工過多，不甚經濟。</p>
<p>㈦綱捕丨淸晨夜間或陰天時，蝗蝻羣集草上，行動極爲遲鈍，可用捕蝗袋捕之。袋爲布製，下附」小袋，大小袋相接處有頸一，虫可入而不可出。其使用方法，可以右手持柄後端約四分之三處，左手則握其末端，人跨草而行，右手送柄向左，使袋在雜草上掃過，旋執之向右，則袋以空氣阻力之關係，自然向右，隨掃隨進，直至產蝗區域之他端，再另易他行，俟蝗蝻充满小袋後即取出斃之。此種死蝗可作作物肥料及飼養家畜之用。</p>
<p>㈧滾壓丨此法係前江西昆虫局局長楊維義君所發明；法以二馬拖一捕蝗轆，以民供代馬亦可，則蝻被擾動跳至轆上，繼以各木棍之相對旋轉，蝻被轆死，此法平坦地點行之，頗爲有效。</p>
<p>㈨毒餌丨毒餌山毒物，引誘物，及附毒處混合而成，但現在有許多昆虫專家認爲引誘物不能增加毒餌殺蝗效力，有主張去之者。其撒布方法有三種；一、用手直接撒布，二、用撒餌器撒布，三、用飛機撒布（俄國）毒餌配合之方式甚多，茲舉數種如下。</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Inaugural Direct Train to Shenyang from Beiping Suffered a Violent Explosion - Bomb Pre-placed in Third-Class Carriage - Exploded Near Hangu and Chadian - Carriages Destroyed with Many Passengers Killed and Injured</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Today's special express train departing directly for Shenyang exploded with a bomb at half past one in the afternoon when it passed Hangu and was about to reach Chadian.</p>
<p>The bomb was placed on wooden boards under luggage in the front part of the eleventh third-class carriage behind the locomotive. The explosion was extremely loud, shattering the roof and sides of the carriage, sending iron fragments and glass shards flying. As a result, ten male and female passengers inside the carriage were injured, and more than thirty passengers suffered minor injuries. Railway guards Chen Ming and Wang Zuo were also injured in the blast. After the explosion, the driver, surnamed Liu, and the co-driver, surnamed Li, immediately applied the brakes and jumped off the train, both sustaining serious head injuries from the fall. A steward inside the carriage, Jin Da, was unable to escape in time and died with his abdomen blown open. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After the incident, the Beining Railway Bureau received the report and immediately dispatched a rescue train to assist the injured. However, due to excessive blood loss, one woman and a passenger surnamed Wang Li died on the spot. When the fourth train of the afternoon passed Chadian, it transported the injured to Tianjin. Upon passing Tanggu, the less severely injured passenger surnamed Wang Li, along with her two-month-old daughter, as well as Chai Huating and Zhang Qing, remained at the local railway hospital for treatment. Another female passenger died on the train while passing Tanggu, and a man died upon arriving at the East Station in Tianjin. Furthermore, Liu Erchi, Lü Yike, Zhang Zhaoxian, Xu Hongye, Bao Lin, and five others were severely injured and transferred by the Railway Bureau to Tianjin's Ma Daifu Hospital for treatment. Liu Erchi was bleeding from both ears, and his chances of survival are slim. The Railway Bureau is arranging for photographs of the dead and injured and preparing for family members to come and investigate. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to eyewitness accounts from passengers, someone disguised as a passenger had hidden the bomb in their luggage before disembarking. The vibrations of the train in motion then triggered the explosion. This afternoon, Yin Tong reported the matter and will travel to Beiping to meet with He. The bureau has also reported this by telegram to the Ministry of Railways and Huang Fu in Shanghai. Following the bombing, traffic was suspended at Chadian for three hours. The damaged carriage was detached, and the journey east continued. It is estimated that the train will arrive at Shanhaiguan around 2:00 AM the day after tomorrow. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning's inaugural direct train to Shenyang from Beiping was traveling between Beitang East and Chadian West around 1:00 PM when someone hidden in a reed marsh suddenly threw a bomb at the train. It hit a third-class carriage. Another account said the bomb was pre-placed on the train. The extent of the explosion and passenger injuries have not yet been fully reported here. It is rumored that seven people were injured. The train stopped immediately, and Chinese and Japanese police searched for the bomber, but found nothing. The train resumed its eastbound journey after 2:00 PM. Consequently, the Beiping-Yuguan train, which was scheduled to arrive in Beiping at 6:42 PM tonight, was delayed by one hour and twenty-five minutes. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong arrived in Beiping at 8:00 PM this evening. According to his account, the former Beining Railway line was severed to avoid acknowledging the puppet state. Now, through technical means, rail service has been restored to benefit compatriots outside the pass. Unexpectedly, at noon today, just before the train was about to reach Chadian, someone disguised as a passenger pre-placed explosives in the second third-class carriage and got off at Tanggu, waiting for the explosion. At the time, there was extreme chaos, with sixteen passengers killed or injured. Measures will be taken to provide compensation. The injured include Xu Jiye, Liu Erzhi, and Zhang Zheyuan. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shibayama visited Yin Tong this evening, using the pretext of needing to travel to Beidaihe for summer, requesting permission to deploy troops for protection due to the numerous bridges. Yin, considering the importance of the matter, requested instructions from the central government. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The initial train from Beiping to Shenyang, which departed at 8:25 AM this morning, passed Tanggu and was approaching the vicinity of Chadian and Hangu at 1:15 PM when a tremendous explosion was heard from within the third-class passenger car attached to the locomotive. The entire third-class passenger car was completely destroyed. More than ten Chinese passengers were killed or injured. The perpetrator remains under investigation. (One-day Japanese Allied Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The damage from the bombing of the Beiping-Shenyang train is as follows: Those killed in the bombing: one man, two women, and one child. Those seriously injured: three men, three women, and one child. Those slightly injured: three men, two women, and one child. In addition, seven people were thrown from the train due to the severe shaking when the passenger car was bombed. The damaged passenger car was removed, and at 2:25 PM on the same day, the train departed from Chadian Station for Shanhaiguan. (One-day Japanese Allied Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the bombing of the Beiping-Shenyang train, it is reported that the bomb was very powerful and had a timing device. It was likely carried by someone boarding the train in Beiping or Tianjin, placed under a seat in the affected passenger car, and wrapped in newspaper. The mastermind is currently presumed to have disembarked in Tanggu and fled. This was the first Beiping-Shenyang through train, and it carried a Transportation Maintenance Team dispatched by the Japanese Army Headquarters in Beiping, totaling fifteen men led by a Staff Sergeant. Also on board was Major Oka, who was traveling to Shanhaiguan on official business. They took emergency measures and ensured that the train and the remaining passengers arrived safely at their destinations. (One-day Japanese Allied Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A telegram from Tianjin reports that the first international through train from Beiping to Pan, which departed from Beiping at 8:45 AM this morning, experienced a bomb explosion in the second third-class car at 1:10 PM when it was about to reach Chading Station, 39 kilometers east of Tanggu. Four Chinese passengers were killed, seven seriously injured, and ten slightly injured. The car was severely damaged. The damaged car was detached, and the train departed at 2:10 PM for Shenyang. The unharmed were sent to Tianjin. The bomb used was very sophisticated and equipped with a clock. The culprit is currently unknown but is suspected to have boarded in Tianjin, disembarked in Tanggu, and resembled a student who hid the bomb under a seat inside the car.

<h3>Beiping-Shenyang Through Train Commences Yesterday - East Station Presents Unprecedented Scene - Foreign Residents from Various Countries Arrive to Observe - Over Three Hundred Chinese and Western Passengers - Japanese Police Officers Ride the Train in Segments to Provide Security</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Beiping-Shenyang through train departed eastward at 8:45 AM this morning. The East Station presented an unprecedented lively scene. A total of 825 platform tickets were sold, and the crowd inside and outside the station numbered over a thousand people. The train consists of equipment allocated by the Beining Railway, including four third-class carriages, one second-class carriage, three first-class carriages, one guard car, and one baggage car. The locomotive is number 189. As for the passengers on board, in addition to the 17 tickets sold by various travel agencies, 61 passengers traveled in third class to the Liaoning Main Station, 9 to the New Station, and 1 in second class. Three people traveled to Jinzhou. 255 people traveled in third class to stations along the line within the Guan (Pass), and 2 in first class. The entire staff of the Qianmen Station was present at the station to assist. For the security of the section of the train within the Guan, matters were handled according to the agreement by our side. Railway police, railway protection teams, and military police continued to serve as they did on the former Beiping-Yuguan train. However, the Japanese side also dispatched police officers to ride the train to provide security, dividing the route into four segments: Beiping-Tianjin, Tianjin-Luanxian, Luanxian-Tangshan, and Tangshan-Yuguan, with shifts rotating. This morning, six Japanese police officers and one soldier, carrying two cages of homing pigeons, arrived at the station led by Captain Yanagishita. Under the direction of the stationmaster on duty, they boarded the designated third-class carriage seats. However, Captain Yanagishita insisted on changing to the first or second class. After negotiations by our side, the Japanese police officers changed to second class, and our police and military police also changed to second class to show equality. The service personnel on the train, in addition to the train conductor Zhou Dechang, guard car attendant Song Ziguang, ticket inspector Wang Wenwei, and relief staff Li Yufeng and Liu Zhenze, all assigned by the Oriental Travel Agency, also included a chief host, Li Baoshu, traveling to Yuguan, for a total of seven train staff members traveling directly to Shenyang. Many foreign residents from various countries arrived at the station to observe. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shibayama arrived at the station at 8:30 AM this morning to oversee the departure of the Beiping-Shenyang through train. He also gave a brief speech to the Japanese police officers riding the train. He stated that the train had departed, and he had no particular feelings about it, except that it was a sign of improving relations between China and Japan. In the future, if it were possible to realize joint Sino-Japanese railway operations, with Chinese trains entering Korea and Tokyo, and Japanese trains directly reaching Beijing-Shanghai and Beijing-Hankou, it would be even more convenient. The unresolved issues in the war zone are currently not being actively negotiated, and he has no plans to go to Tianjin recently. (One-day special dispatch) (Beiping) The Beining Railway's third express train to Yuguan, which departed every morning at 8:30 AM, has been canceled starting today due to the launch of the Beiping-Shenyang through train. Train number 102, which arrived in Beiping every morning at 10:15 AM, has also been canceled for the same reason. Train number 4 arrives in Beiping as usual, and train number 101 still runs to Yuguan. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A set of South Manchuria Railway train cars arrived in Beiping this afternoon and is currently parked at the East Station in preparation for departing for Pan the day after tomorrow. The train consists of a total of ten cars: one observation car, car number 1; two flatbed cars, car numbers 5 and 10; one dining car, car number 4, which is a converted Beining dining car; four third-class cars, car numbers 104, 102, 306, and 310; one baggage car, car number 20; and one postal car, car number 101. The train captain is Nishina Shuichi, a clerk in the Operations Section of the Puppet Fengtian Railway. There are over thirty train attendants, both Chinese and Japanese. When the train departed from Tanggu Station, farmers threw bricks and stones, breaking many of the car windows. New windows have been installed since arriving in Beiping. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Beiping-Shenyang express train that passed through Tianjin this afternoon carried a total of 73 Western passengers and 287 Chinese passengers. Among them, besides a few who were traveling to Beidaihe for summer or disembarking at Yuguan and Luanxian, approximately 130 Chinese passengers and over 20 Western passengers were going to Shenyang, Xinmin, and Suizhong. Ticket-selling agencies such as the Tianjin International Tourist Bureau, China Travel Service, and American Express Company were closed because it was Sunday, so no tickets were sold. The Tianjin East Station sold two second-class tickets, 32 third-class tickets, and two children's tickets to Shenyang, as well as one ticket each to Suizhong, Xinmin, and Jinzhou. The tea servers on the through train all wore white uniforms, with blue trim for those in the dining car and red trim for those in the first and second class cars. The menus in the dining car were all printed with the five characters "Oriental Travel Agency," and the dates used the Gregorian calendar. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) When the first Beiping-Shenyang special express train arrived at Tianjin Station at 11:20 AM this morning after departing from Beiping, the postal car was not attached. Otherwise, the train was organized according to the through train regulations, with a total of nine cars including first, second, and third class cars, as well as the guard car, baggage car, and dining car. The train conductor was Zhou Dechang, the former conductor of the third train of the old Beining Railway. Liu Zhenze, ticket inspectors Wang Wenwei and Li Yufeng, and eight railway police officers and six Japanese soldiers, along with one sergeant, were on the train, all wearing armbands with "Police Escort" written in black ink on white cloth, patrolling the train. They changed shifts at the East Station with the Japanese soldiers and police officers scheduled to be stationed here. The Japanese soldiers dispatched from Tianjin escorted the train to Tangshan, where they were relieved along the way until Yuguan. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The oxtail soup on the menu of the through train from Shenyang has been renamed "Mutual Benefit Soup" to indicate that the through train is for the mutual benefit of China and Japan. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Shuiqi, General Manager of the Oriental Travel Agency, recently traveled to Yuguan with Hu Shiyuan and Zhou Sizhong to establish a general office there. Zhou returned from Yuguan to Beiping and reported that the address for the Oriental Travel Agency has been secured at Yuguan Station, and the office will begin operations on the 29th. Deputy Japanese Manager Hirayama has arrived at the general office to work. There are eight Japanese employees and over ten Chinese employees in the general office. In addition to Hu Shiyuan being appointed as the Chief of the General Affairs Section by General Manager Zhang Shuiqi, the other sections still need the Railway Bureau to dispatch personnel as soon as possible.

<p>(Nanjing) Railway Minister Gu Mengyu issued a printed written statement regarding the Supervisory Yuan's impeachment case, totaling about 10,000 words. It details the process of concluding the purchase contract for the Tongxi Railway, in two parts: Part A addresses three items that should be defended in the review report, concluding that the Supervisory Yuan's review report lacks any factual basis for the so-called illegal and corrupt acts. Part B addresses four items that should be defended in the original impeachment case: 1) the recovery of the Zhengtai Railway rights was not in the hands of Frenchmen, and it is not harsh to guarantee a new loan of 10 million yuan with an income of over 1 million yuan; 2) the purchase contract is different from a loan and should not be forcibly called a loan contract; 3) it describes the dispute between the Datong Railway and Shanxi Province over running a light railway, and the temporary suspension of work at the Datong Engineering Office, transferring the purchased materials for use on other lines; 4) it accuses Supervisory Committee member Liu Houwu of spreading false rumors and defamation.

<h3>Current Commentary: Official Examinations and Official Governance</h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>Sima Guang of the Song Dynasty once said, "The key to governance is nothing more than obtaining talented people. If all officials are competent, then all tasks will be accomplished." This insightful statement is truly a timeless argument.</p>
<p>I have often pondered the source of corruption and failure in official governance throughout history. It lies in nothing more than four aspects: First, the path to officialdom is indiscriminate. Those in power form factions and engage in private interests. Those in the wilderness sell themselves to seek glory. Human feelings are biased, and relatives and friends flatter each other. Second, the methods of supervision and responsibility are lax. Selections are blind from the start, and evaluations and examinations are abandoned later. Praise, promotion, demotion, and dismissal are rarely based on regulations. Retiring scholars find it difficult to be at ease in their positions, while obsequious petty men rise rapidly. Third, the way of bribery is widespread. Extravagance, luxury, and indulgence become habits. If salaries are insufficient, then officials accept bribes to enrich themselves. They openly view becoming an official as a shortcut to wealth, and government offices become places for rewarding mediocrity. Fourth, encouragement of integrity is weak. Social customs are fickle, and the world values power and profit. History does not say that even the robber Zhi is considered virtuous when his position is high and his salary is generous? When his fur coat is tattered and his money is exhausted, even his parents will disown him. This trend has been prevalent since ancient times and is even more severe today. Due to these four evils, corrupt officials are rampant throughout the world, and those who can maintain their integrity are as rare as phoenix feathers. Even if there is such a person, if they stay in office for a long time, their colleagues will be jealous and scold them as hypocrites, and their superiors will be unhappy and hint that they should retire. If they are scolded and hinted at and still maintain their principles, they will be ostracized for some reason. How can one expect the country's affairs not to be ruined?</p>
<p>The five Yuan of the National Government have been established to govern the country with the employment of people as the foundation. Therefore, the Examination Yuan is responsible for selecting talented people and evaluating their administrative achievements. The Yuan has already held public examinations for various civil servants to broaden the path for talent and select true talent for the country. In January of this year, it also planned to establish a national examination for current officials to observe their administrative achievements. The intention behind this initiative is to strictly control the path to officialdom and carefully supervise and hold officials accountable. When the news came out, those who cared about the future of official governance in our country were all looking forward to it. However, half a year has passed, and there has been no news. Why is that?</p>
<p>As far as we know, the Examination Yuan has long had a system for evaluating the performance of civil servants. The Yuan formulates forms and regulations, instructing the heads of various agencies to add comments to the performance of their subordinates. The forms are filled in according to the regulations and submitted to the Yuan for review. However, the various agencies comply superficially and treat it as a formality. The comments made by the heads of agencies are mostly vague and fail to hit the mark. They are nothing more than "So-and-so is diligent and conscientious in his work." Even if it is contrary to the facts, they do not bother to investigate and instead cover it up. There is a reason for this. The low-level employees who report to work every day and handle routine official duties are not worth discussing. Those who are in charge of certain aspects of government and enjoy the title of some director or some director are likely to have powerful patrons supporting them. Officials protect each other, and this has been the case throughout history. As a leader, one must be experienced in the world and familiar with human relationships. And how long does a term last? Who wants to make enemies of their subordinates, strictly pick on them, and offend the powerful patrons? With this kind of connection, the original intention of the evaluation is lost. The date of the official examination that the Examination Yuan once promoted is still uncertain. Even if it is held, whether its nature will follow the example of school examinations is also questionable. School examinations generally follow the old pattern of setting questions and answering them. Their scope is limited to students' book knowledge and eloquence. It is superfluous to explain why it is not suitable for current officials. As for how to avoid the abuses of the previous evaluation, this is what we are deeply concerned about.</p>
<p>We believe that the regulations on evaluation, qualification, and selection previously promulgated by the National Government are generally sound in principle and flawless. However, the abuses of perfunctory implementation by various agencies must be corrected. Today, if we want to talk about official examinations, we must be determined to act decisively and never be soft or slippery, deceiving ourselves and others. However, implementing examinations is only enough to determine the examinee's depth of understanding of the examination questions, and it is not enough to see the clarity or murkiness of their heart. Therefore, the way to govern the heart and encourage integrity cannot be ignored. The so-called encouragement of integrity is not necessarily difficult. In this turbulent world, the people yearn for good governance. If there is someone who holds an important position and swears to dedicate their heart and strength to the country, showing their sincere love to the people in the midst of fire and water, sharpening their integrity, and changing the atmosphere, it will be easy. If we emphasize the warning of the law and the restraint of the system, even if there are many officials, none will dare to overstep the rules and abandon their responsibility as public servants. If this is the case, the source of corruption and decadence in official governance can be stopped, and the purpose of official examinations will also be accomplished.</p>

<h3>Britain Resolves to Create - Maritime Hegemon</h3>
<p>Expansion Plan to be Completed Within Five Years</p>
<p>(London) Today, according to reports from political experts in the Sunday Chronicle and the Daily Mail, the British government has resolved to make the British navy "the largest navy in the world." It is said that the cabinet has also decided on plans to expand the army and air force. The navy's construction plan includes thirty cruisers, twelve dreadnoughts, and a number of destroyers and aircraft carriers, costing approximately 100 million pounds, to be completed within five years. The cabinet recently decided not to implement the so-called "pre-war policy." This plan is based on that policy and simultaneously increases the strength of the army. As for the air force, it is planned to build six hundred fighter planes, approximately doubling the current strength, and train pilots. There are also plans to build new airfields in Hong Kong, Singapore, Aden, and India. (One-day National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Japan Actively Expanding Air Force - Private Factories Unable to Meet Demand - Decides to Manufacture Aircraft Internally</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to sources in the Navy Ministry, the Japanese navy's aircraft have been contracted to private factories such as the Mitsubishi Aircraft Factory in Nagoya, Nakajima Aircraft Company, and Ishikawajima Shipyard. However, the navy has decided to expand its strength, increasing the number of aviation squadrons by eight. And because of the frequent exercises and the short lifespan of the aircraft, even though an average of one aircraft is manufactured every two days, it is still felt to be insufficient. In view of this, the Navy Ministry has decided to establish an aircraft department within the Sasebo Naval Arsenal to manufacture aircraft internally. This plan is intended as a beginning, and the official regulations are currently being drafted. After the draft is completed, it will be submitted to the cabinet for approval.

<h3>Hitler Eliminates Dissidents, Stormtroopers Stand By, Lutze Appointed New Leader, Seven Rebel Leaders Executed on the Spot, Order Restored to Normal in Berlin</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Following the momentous events in Berlin and Munich yesterday, Germany has now returned to calm today. Traffic has also returned to normal throughout the country. Although police squads are still patrolling with guns, their numbers are the same as usual.

<h3>Hitler Strictly Enacts Three Articles of Covenant</h3>
<p>Authorizes Goering to Act Expediently</p>
<p>(Berlin) Chancellor Hitler, in the name of the supreme leader of the Party Army, has issued the following instructions to the newly appointed Chief of Staff of the Party Army, Lutze, for his compliance:</p>
<p>Strictly Observe Discipline (1) I require all leaders and members of the stormtroopers to absolutely obey my orders, strictly observe discipline without reservation.</p>
<p>(2) I require all leaders of the stormtroopers to be upright in conduct and to serve as models.</p>
<p>(3) All leaders of the stormtroopers and directors of political groups whose conduct is unsatisfactory will be expelled from the Party without leniency.</p>
<p>Avoid Extravagance (4) The leaders of the stormtroopers must strive to be simple in their civil affairs so that people can emulate them. For example, the extravagant internal equipment of the Berlin headquarters of the Party Army, with monthly banquet expenses reaching as much as 30,000 marks, should be disbanded immediately. Furthermore, all leaders are not allowed to hold so-called diplomatic banquets. (5) I do not wish to see leaders of the stormtroopers using luxurious cars for transportation. (6) Leaders who are publicly drunk are not qualified to lead the people.</p>
<p>Maintain Public Morals (7) I want all leaders to cooperate with me so that the Party Army organization maintains its clean and sound nature, so that mothers throughout the country can entrust their children to the Party Army for training without fear of moral or ethical corruption. (The so-called morality refers to homosexuality.) For this reason, I want all leaders to strictly monitor and, if any homosexual affairs occur, after punishment according to Article 175 of the Criminal Code, immediately expel the offender from the Party or expel them from the stormtroopers. I want all leaders to behave as human beings and not like beasts.</p>
<p>Loyalty to the Nation (8) I require all leaders of the Party Army to be loyal to the nation and treat national defense affairs with absolute sincerity. (9) I hope all leaders will encourage themselves with courage and sacrifice and not merely use these to demand from their subordinates.</p>
<p>(30th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Aviation Minister Goering, applying the power of expediency granted by Hitler, issued a declaration to the stormtroopers of Berlin and Brandenburg Province, explaining the following matters: (1) No one shall criticize those who are punished according to military law under the Chancellor's orders.

<h3>National Defense Forces Pledge Allegiance to the Government</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Yesterday, when Chancellor Hitler punished the stormtroopers, he relied on the strength of the National Defense Forces. The army announced a state of alert, prepared to mobilize, and some said that the National Defense Forces in Munich actually provided assistance. Today, National Defense Minister General von Blomberg issued a letter to the army, stating, "I respectfully inform the army that Chancellor Hitler, with a military-like decision and exemplary courage, attacked and eliminated the rebels. We soldiers, holding weapons to defend the people of the whole country, should remain aloof from internal political struggles. Our only obligation is to be loyal to the country. The Chancellor hopes that the army and the newly reorganized stormtroopers can have a good relationship. I hope the army can develop this good relationship with a full understanding of common ideals. The state of alert in all places is hereby canceled immediately." Signed, Blomberg. (One-Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Nazi Party Communiqué: The Aftermath of Purging Dissidents, A Revolutionary Conspiracy Brewing for Months, Röhm and Schleicher Were the Prime Movers, Hitler Personally Went to Munich to Suppress It, Indecent Events Discovered</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Nazi Party Information Office issued a communiqué regarding the course of this incident, outlining it as follows:</p>
<p>For several months, some people in the country have been plotting to create antipathy between the stormtroopers and the Nazi Party and the state. Chief of Staff Röhm, who was highly trusted by the Chancellor, not only failed to prevent this plan, but also encouraged it. Without informing the Chancellor, he had relations with General Schleicher. As this plan gradually developed and privately negotiated with a certain country, it became necessary to take decisive measures for the sake of the Party and the country. After discovering the various premeditated incidents, the Chancellor personally flew to Munich at 2 a.m. this morning, immediately dismissed the leaders most deeply involved, and ordered their arrest. Hitler also went to the West region where Röhm was vacationing to completely eradicate the conspiracy. When Röhm was arrested, countless shameful acts were discovered, so the Chancellor ordered a complete crackdown to avoid millions of innocent people being poisoned. The Chancellor also ordered Prussian Prime Minister Goering to take the same measures in Berlin, especially to eliminate the reactionaries associated with this coup conspiracy. This afternoon, at a stormtrooper leaders' meeting in Munich, Hitler gave a speech, saying that his trust in the stormtroopers remained unchanged. At the same time, he declared that morbid elements who were unrestrained and resisted orders must be eliminated. Hitler said that the responsibility of stormtroopers was glorious service, and hundreds of thousands of members had already made great sacrifices in the past, so everyone must strive for this sacrifice and be a model for future generations. Over the years, Röhm had tried his best to defend against external attacks, but the recent incident forced him to eliminate this counter-revolutionary action of ambitious people in one fell swoop. The communiqué claimed that Röhm and Schleicher were the prime movers of this conspiracy, and claimed that Röhm had communicated with representatives of a certain country. (One-Day National Telegram)</p>
<p>A telegram from Munich, issued by the Nazi Party's communication office, explained the situation of Chancellor Hitler personally suppressing the rebellion. It was reported that the Chancellor arrived at the Munich airport by plane at 4 a.m. and learned that the Munich Party Army stormtroopers had received a slogan the previous night, saying, "The leader (referring to Hitler) and the National Defense Forces are making things difficult for us stormtroopers. Should the members of each corps rebel?" It was then learned that the Bavarian Interior Minister had already automatically arrested the senior captains of the Party Army. Hitler personally tore off the epaulettes of each captain and stripped them of their duties. At 5:30 a.m., the Chancellor led his entourage to Röhm's villa, broke into his bedroom, and personally arrested him. Röhm surrendered. Party Army squad leader Heines was also living in the same villa. Hitler then entered Heines' bedroom and saw him sleeping with a boy. The state was unbearable to watch. The Chancellor was furious and arrested Heines immediately. Also, most of the staff and guards of Röhm's staff headquarters were arrested at the same time. The communiqué stated that the Party Army stormtroopers would continue to be loyal to the Chancellor and that the contemptible behavior of the people would also be exposed. (30th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Causes of the Rebellion in Danzig</h3>
<p>A certain German conservative in the Free City of Danzig, Warsaw, issued a statement to a reporter from the local daily newspaper, explaining the situation before the Nazi Party's rebellion. It was claimed that "Recently, Chancellor Hitler went to Neudeck Castle in East Prussia to visit President Hindenburg and report on the results of his talks with Mussolini in Venice. At the same time, he expressed his intention to exclude Vice-Chancellor Papen to the President. Hindenburg expressed his approval of Papen's speech at the University of Marburg (made on June 17, which contained slander of the Nazi Party's internal affairs). He reportedly told Hitler that he (the President himself) was completely related to Papen, and if Papen was forced to resign, he would resign himself. Hitler then promised the President that the speech in Marburg would not have adverse consequences for Papen." (30th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Seven Rebel Leaders Executed</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Former Chief of Staff of the Nazi Party stormtroopers, Röhm, and squad leaders Heines (Governor of Pleßlau), Ernst (squad leader of Berlin and Brandenburg Province) and Detten, all former members of the Prussian Council of State, were dismissed from their positions as members of the Prussian Council of State by Prussian Prime Minister Goering after this incident occurred. The other squad leaders</p>

<h3>Traffic Blockaded Between Germany and Austria to Prevent Nazi Party Violence</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today's developments in the German political situation have caused serious anxiety among people in Berlin, fearing that the split of the Nazi Party will have repercussions in Central Europe. If Hitler's authority weakens, the extreme elements on the Austrian border and the Austrian Nazi Party members in Germany may carry out violent movements. (30th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>The border between Vienna, Germany and Austria has been formally and completely blockaded. No one is allowed on trains coming from Germany. All passengers disembark at the border station. According to the news received here from Innsbruck, the Nazi Party is engaged in terrorist activities in Austria in order to focus attention on this matter and ignore the brewing of the Nazi Party's second stormtrooper revolution. On Wednesday night, the Nazi Party supplied Austrian Party members with explosives, but most of the Party members were discovered by the Austrian border guards when they crossed the border with weapons and were arrested.

<h3>German Newspapers Unanimously Praise Mr. Hitler</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler suppressed the incident with a firm and agile hand, and the German newspapers unanimously praised him. The Berlin Morning Post said that some elements in Germany have nothing to do with the Nazi Party, but they do not hesitate to collude with foreign countries and betray their motherland. Hi-</p>

<p>Monday (10th)</p>
<p>Hitler has now decisively punished these people. The Berlin Daily News said that Hitler's actions provided Germany with security, which was very fortunate. Hitler's punishment was timely. It also said, "Hitler's rule over the Party Army is based on loyalty, honor, and integrity." The Local Guidance News said, "From now on, no one will dare to advocate a second revolution." The newspaper believed that Goering was a person who used an iron fist to punish the enemies of the country and that the purge movement would definitely be successful. The Deutsche Zeitung said that it was a pity that this happened, but now it has completely ended. The Berlin Stock Exchange Daily News said that the stormtroopers will be reorganized with new people trusted by Hitler. The newspaper said, "What kind of impression will this have abroad? Hitler saw the country in danger yesterday and quelled the incident with one person's strength. Can the strength of his courage and his individual courage be compared with the political leaders of all countries in the world?" (One-Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Stormtroopers Lose Political Status</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today's coup occurred quickly and with the force of a thunderbolt, but there was no public reaction in German public opinion.</p>
<p>The news of the arrest of Nazi Party Army Chief of Staff Röhm and other important figures of the Party Army, mixed with various sordid rumors, so ordinary people only paid attention to the obscene news, but ignored the importance of political conspiracy. However, from our point of view, after this incident, there is a result that is very obvious, that is, the leaders of the stormtroopers have either been dismissed or their leadership has not been guaranteed. It can be seen that from now on, unless an unexpected situation occurs, the stormtroopers will no longer occupy an important position in German politics. The government's actions today were extremely agile, but it is still difficult for us to say what the true relationship is. No one knows the true situation of Vice-Chancellor Papen. There are many contradictions in the news about Papen. However, it seems that it has been confirmed that Papen is only being watched by the police in his residence and has not been arrested. It can be seen from this that Papen is regarded as suspicious. But we don't seem to think that this has anything to do with the arrest of the leaders of the stormtroopers. In view of the punishment of the revolutionary elements and rebellious elements of the Party Army, or that Hitler's politics are turning reactionary, but Propaganda Minister Goebbels follows Hitler, never leaving him, which seems to prove otherwise. Aviation Minister Goering said that this</p>
<p>The government's actions are on the one hand to punish the undisciplined Party Army, and on the other hand to suppress reaction. The tragic end of former Chancellor Schleicher and his relationship with political conspiracies, as stated in the communiqué, are difficult to understand. The communiqué stated that Party Army Chief of Staff Röhm had a relationship with Schleicher, and some said that a large-scale political conspiracy had already been launched. Hitler's confidant Strasser also heard about it and seems to have been arrested. In short, we can only get one conclusion about this matter, that is, Hitler wants to maintain his authority to resist the reaction of the right or the left. Another thing that is unquestionable is that the National Defense Forces have now become one of the main factors of national authority, and in the minds of senior officers of the National Defense Forces, Hitler is the representative of the state.

<h3>French Newspapers Predict More Trouble for German Politics from Now On</h3>
<p>(Paris) French public opinion has felt the chaos of the German political situation for some time, believing that it must be fundamentally resolved one day. At first, I did not expect the unexpected to happen so hastily. No one can say what the outcome of this incident will be. Although Hitler's victory seems to have been decided, can we immediately say that those who oppose the government have surrendered? The Morning Post said, "We must know that the fierce reaction has not ended." The Little Parisian Newspaper said, "June 30 is probably not the end of the first stage of the Hitlerist revolution. Given time, reaction is inevitable." The Daily News said, "The Goering faction has been overwhelmed by the Goebbels faction, and some say that the plans of the extremists have been stopped by the National Defense Forces." Several newspapers expressed the same opinion, all believing that the power of Prussian militarism in 1914 has now raised its head again. The "Figaro" newspaper said that one thing is no longer doubtful, that is, "Germany has been controlled by the National Defense Forces. Although Hitler is still a symbol of Germany, he has become a prisoner of the National Defense Forces." The People's Daily said, "Does Hitler occupy a guiding position, or is he being manipulated? However, in any case, a Prussian-style Germany under the control of the National Defense Forces seems to have prevailed." (One-Day Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers: The National Socialist System Is Fundamentally Shaken</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) Yesterday, a dramatic change occurred in Germany. When the news reached London, only the Sunday Express put the initial impressions it had gained into words, saying, "The internal rebellious actions of the German stormtroopers and the government's means of punishment are enough to shake the National Socialist system. This is undoubtedly true. From now on, Hitler must exert his power in order to restore his lost prestige." Although the Sunday Express has this argument, the local newspapers here are generally silent today and do not make criticisms. They will wait for the Berlin reporters of each newspaper to make detailed reports on the various movements that have occurred in Germany since Vice-Chancellor Papen gave a speech at the University of Marburg. However, the meaningful headlines that are often placed before the news of the day are also enough to show that Hitler's cruel means of curbing the extreme actions of his party members have not caused a sad impression in Britain.

<h3>American Newspapers Pay Attention to Goebbels' Attitude</h3>
<p>(New York) According to a reporter from the New York Times in Washington, the US State Department had anticipated the sudden German incident, so it was not surprised when the news came. However, it was unexpected that it was so violent and abrupt. A State Department official, known for his familiarity with German issues, told a New York Times reporter that the State Department's most attention is currently focused on what position German Propaganda Minister Goebbels will take in the future. From Washington's observation, Goebbels has held an extreme attitude up to now. Yesterday's recovery was obviously a mutual attack of two different tendencies. Which way will Goebbels go? This is a matter of great importance and is worthy of attention. (30th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Internal Crisis Still Not Gone</h3>
<p>(New York) The New York Times published an editorial commenting on the German incident, saying that the death of former Chancellor Schleicher and Hitler's order to execute the leaders of the stormtroopers proved that Hitler had now decided to use the National Defense Forces to eliminate the left wing of the Nazi Party. The newspaper also said that Hitler usually gives great leniency to his subordinates, even if their actions are enough to harm the reputation of the Nazi Party, Hitler also understands. However, this incident proves that Hitler's attitude has changed greatly. The news from Germany shows that Germany must establish a military dictatorship in order to avoid internal strife. The New York Times then narrated one by one the events that occurred in Germany after the speech given at the University of Marburg, and said that Papen's speech must have obtained Hitler's approval. The newspaper continued, "The crisis in German internal affairs is becoming more and more serious due to various factors, among which the factors related to diplomacy are the most important."

<h3>U.S. Finances: New Fiscal Year Begins, Preparing to Raise New Debt, Seeking Balanced Budget</h3>
<p>(Washington) Starting tomorrow, the U.S. government will begin a new fiscal year, preparing to raise new debt in the hope of restoring balance to the national economic organization. The government's plan is "to end insufficiency with sufficiency," with very large expenditures on public works and relief projects. It is hoped that normality can be restored after one year, and that the government's finances can also be put on the right track. The original budget deficit for the new fiscal year was 20 billion yuan, but because the deficit for this year is less than the original 7 billion yuan, it may need to be exceeded. The restoration plan was originally set for two years, with slightly less funding at the beginning and an increase in the second year. However, the government's goal is to balance revenue and expenditure from July 1, 1935. The budget submitted by President Roosevelt to Congress last January proposed raising debt of 31,834,000,000 yuan by June 30, 1935. Roosevelt said that according to government estimates, it should not exceed this amount. Judging from the current situation, the President's goal should not be difficult to achieve, unless there is some change in the business community that reduces government revenue. (National News Agency Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. government's fiscal year from 1933 to 1934 ended today. After settlement, the "deficit" amounted to approximately 4 billion U.S. dollars. The amount of expenditure this year was unprecedented for the government in peacetime, so the amount of debt is also unprecedented. It is said that the federal government issued a total of 7 billion yuan in currency, while revenue was only 3.1 billion yuan. Although the shortfall is huge, it is still less than the original budget deficit of 3.3 billion yuan, because the original budget expenditure was 10 billion yuan and revenue was 4 billion yuan.

<h3>Anglo-German Debt Talks Approaching, British Clearing Office Postponed Indefinitely</h3>
<p>(London) The Anglo-German Debt Clearing Office was originally scheduled to be established on Monday, but it was officially announced today that it has been postponed indefinitely to await the progress of negotiations.

A communiqué stated that today's meeting "has gradually approached" and the meeting has been adjourned until Monday for "representatives to consult with their respective governments."

<h3>Canadian Port of Hull: Japanese Fishing Boats Expelled</h3>
<p>Retaliatory Action by Canadian Fishermen</p>
<p>Sixty Canadian fishing boats in the Canadian port of Hull, British Columbia, formed a dense formation and charged eight Japanese fishing boats, expelling the Japanese fishermen from Hull and out to sea.</p>
<p>They were not allowed to fish in the vicinity again. This incident was due to retaliation by Canadian fishermen, because Japanese fishermen had complained to the Canadian authorities that Canadian fishermen had threatened them with guns. After receiving the complaint, the authorities arrested two local fishermen, causing great anger among the rest, leading to the retaliatory action. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet on the Verge of Collapse: Report on Corruption Case to Be Submitted Tomorrow, Konoe Returns Home Early to Deal with the Political Situation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The key to changes in the political situation lies in the occasion of Justice Minister Oyama's so-called interim report. The Prime Minister, Finance Minister, Interior Minister Yamaki, and others are expected to receive the report by the regular Cabinet meeting on the 3rd. Based on the content of Justice Minister Oyama's report, they will discuss the government's attitude. It is said that the report will not only cover the truth of the Ministry of Finance scandal, but also the full picture of a certain incident and its investigation results, the facts regarding the relationship between current and past cabinet members, and the future development trends. Therefore, Prime Minister Saito should bear full responsibility for recommending cabinet members, maintain his integrity, and request to resign. The timing should be after the Justice Minister's report on the morning of the 3rd. If there is a delay, the collective resignation should be decided by the 4th or 5th at the latest. This is a general and powerful observation.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The form of the report on the Ministry of Finance scandal has been carefully studied by the judicial authorities. They believe that if it is done in the form of an official document, it would be difficult to be complete without drafting a detailed investigation report based on the prosecutor's investigation. Not only are the procedures complicated, but the document may also become a problem in the parliament in the future. Therefore, it has been decided to deliver an oral report. If the Prime Minister requests a written report, only a memorandum outlining the main points can be submitted for reference. (Japanese News Agency Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese political world has been tense in recent days. Groups of feudal forces and the Araki faction have telegraphed Duke Konoe to return home early to deal with the new political situation. At the same time, they are contacting the legitimate May 15th Prosecutor Group within the Ministry of Justice to thoroughly investigate the corruption case involving financial cliques and political parties. It is said that the former ministers Nakajima and Hatoyama are in great danger. Several directors of small financial companies and senior officials of the Ministry of Finance's banking bureau may also be imprisoned. Interior Minister Yamamoto also advocates taking responsibility and resigning. Faced with this new situation, elder statesmen are quite worried. Today, Baron Harada met with the Prime Minister and then went to Okitsu to report to Elder Saionji and seek his advice on how to deal with the situation. (Chinese News Agency Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) (1st) Konoe Fumimaro, who is in the United States, originally planned to formally meet with Roosevelt and prominent figures in the American government and public, and then take his family to the United States, and accompany his son Fumitaka, who is studying at Princeton University, on a summer vacation trip across the United States. His wife and daughters were originally scheduled to depart from Yokohama on the Hikawa Maru on the 19th. However, they suddenly received a telegram from the Duke a few days ago, instructing them to cancel their trip to the United States and that he himself would depart with his son soon and return home, arriving in Yokohama on August 1st. Presumably due to the current situation, the Duke's return home has attracted much attention. (Japanese News Agency Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>There is an isthmus between Ariake Bay and Omura Bay in Kyushu, Nagasaki, with a length of 20,000 meters from east to west, which hinders sea traffic. It is inconvenient both militarily and economically. The Ministry of Navy and the Ministry of Interior plan to dig a canal through this isthmus. The Ministry of Interior sent engineer Akihara to conduct an on-site survey, who believed that it would be relatively easy to dig. After returning to Tokyo and reporting, he has now ordered the Nagasaki Prefectural Civil Engineering Department to conduct a more detailed survey of the terrain and budget the expenses. The expenses will be submitted to the next parliament, and construction can begin after its approval. (Chinese News Agency Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>Premier Wang's Speech on the Anniversary of the Founding of the National Government</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Premier Wang gave a report on the anniversary of the founding of the National Government on July 1st. The main points of his speech were: First, he stated that for thirteen years, the revolutionary government in Guangzhou was in a position of being attacked on all sides. In the east, Chen Jiongming and others occupied Huizhou, Chaozhou, and Meizhou, and pressed directly on Shilong. In the southwest, Deng Benyin and others cut off the Dongjiang River and occupied the Nanlu region. In the north, the Northern Warlords occupied Jiangxi and launched occasional raids. Even the revolutionary base in Guangzhou was controlled and manipulated by Yang Ximin, Liu Zhenhuan, and others. On November 13th of that year, the Premier went north to convene the National Assembly. On December 4th, he arrived in Tianjin, already seriously ill. On January 14th, he was taken to Beijing, and on the 26th, it was announced that he was incurable. Chen Jiongming, upon hearing this news, decided to attack Guangzhou. At that time, the Whampoa Military Academy had not been established for long. Under the guidance of Principal Chiang Kai-shek and Party Representative Liao Zhongkai, a student army was formed, uniting various armies to fight back with all their might, and recovered the various counties of Dongjiang. At that time, the Premier's illness was on the verge of death, but he was somewhat comforted by this victory. The revolutionary seeds that he had painstakingly nurtured had sprouted. At the same time, he also worried that these newly sprouting seeds would be destroyed by countless storms. Next, he stated that the sprouting of these seeds was due to the efforts to strengthen the Party's organization and its propaganda and training after the First National Congress in the spring of the 13th year, to establish a popular foundation for the national revolution, and to strive to create the Whampoa Military Academy and organize a student army, to establish the central military force of the national revolution. However, from this, it can be inferred that after these seeds sprouted, it would be impossible to avoid the destruction of wind and rain. Just as Dongjiang had just been recovered, Yang Ximin, Liu Zhenhuan, and others conspired to offer the revolutionary base in Guangzhou to the southwestern warlords after the Premier passed away in Beijing on March 12th. Therefore, our army had to return to Guangzhou to suppress Yang and Liu. After Guangzhou was pacified on June 12th, the Shameen Incident occurred on June 23rd. Moreover, the remnants of Dongjiang also took advantage of our army's return to Guangzhou to make a comeback. From the 12th to the 23rd, the comrades were concentrating on abolishing the armies named after regions, such as the Yunnan Army, Guangdong Army, and Guangxi Army, retraining them, establishing the National Revolutionary Army, and dividing military and civil administrative powers, dividing military supplies and finances, and other important tasks. What remained were the various issues of the organization and personnel selection of the National Government. After the 23rd, knowing that the national revolution had reached its most critical juncture, they disregarded everything and established the National Government on July 1st to shoulder the great mission of survival and continuation. Moreover, after the National Government was established on this day, the first step was to consolidate the revolutionary base in Guangzhou, the second step was to retake Dongjiang and eliminate the remnants in western and southern Guangdong, unifying Guangdong, the third step was to unite the forces of Li Zongren, Huang Shaoxiong, Bai Chongxi, and other comrades in Guangxi to unify the two Guang provinces, and the fourth step was to unite the forces of Tang Shengzhi in Hunan to advance north. These four steps were completed within a year, laying the foundation for the Northern Expedition to unify the country. Next, he stated that in this year, the National Government had made extraordinary progress and achievements both domestically and internationally, but there were also extraordinary shortcomings, namely, that after Communist Party members joined our Party, signs of rebellion gradually emerged. At the beginning of Communist Party members joining, our Party comrades believed in their solemn oaths to work hard for the national revolution, so they did not suspect anything else. After their signs of rebellion were discovered one after another, the awareness and response of our Party comrades varied, so their words and actions also varied, causing the rampancy of Communist Party members and the development of the national revolutionary forces to proceed simultaneously. It was not until the Nanjing Party Purge on April 12th and the Wuhan Party Purge on July 15th that the Communist Party members fully revealed their hideous faces, openly rebelled, first with the Nanchang Uprising on July 20th, and then with the Guangzhou Uprising on December 11th. To this day, the remnants still poison Jiangxi and other provinces, and the suppression of the Communists has become a prerequisite for national salvation and survival. In summary, forgetting the past is a lesson for the future. Today's national crisis is even more serious than at the beginning of the establishment of the National Government. He hoped that his comrades would unite sincerely and continue to work hard to eliminate the national crisis and bring China to freedom and equality, to complete the mission of the National Government.

(3) Division Commander Xu Shaozong's telegram on the 21st stated that our 7th and 8th brigades attacked Zhenlong Pass, Wolong Village, Yuan Dingzi, and Fenbi Village with all their might. The bandits could not withstand it and collapsed towards Zhibaokou Caobachang, and have completely occupied these places. (4) Deputy Commander Fan Shaozeng's telegram on the 22nd stated that, after my unit, Zhou's Brigade, attacked Desheng Mountain, they bravely followed up in the rain, and completely occupied Tongjiang on the night of the 21st. The bandits retreated towards Mao Yu Town. Our army captured many prisoners. This morning, Liao and Meng's two brigades have advanced to the line of Zhuxingchang, Mashi Town, and Guojielou. I respectfully report what the above is like, in addition to strictly ordering all routes to track and pursue. I, Liu Xiang, kowtow." On the 24th and 25th, Fan and Xu's two divisions of the Fifth Route Army, Li and Chen's two brigades of the Third Route Army, and Yang and Gao's two brigades of the Fourth Route Army, respectively suppressed the remaining bandits near Tongjiang. At the same time, the Fifth Route Army occupied Mao Yu Town, and the Third Route Army occupied Wang Ping. Only Caoba is still in the hands of the bandits. It is expected that it can also be taken down within one or two days.</p>
<h3>The Looting Remaining in Tongcheng County</h3>
<p>When the bandits withdrew from Tongjiang, they set fire to the four gates, coercing the able-bodied men to leave. Only twenty-odd households were left in the city, in extremely miserable condition. Li Qixiang telegraphed the headquarters yesterday, reporting the tragic situation in Tongcheng, roughly as follows: "Checking that Tongcheng fell into the hands of the bandits earliest and has been a bandit den for the longest time, now, thanks to your virtue and power, it can be recovered. However, after the destruction, it is full of devastation, and the local system is completely non-existent. Moreover, when the bandits collapsed and retreated, they set fire to burn civilian houses. Although they fought and rescued, extinguishing the fires immediately, the huts are ruins and many are rubble. The people who were not coerced away by the bandits are only a few dozen disabled women and children. They are gaunt and on the verge of death. At this time of recovery, matters regarding comfort, post-disaster relief, salvation, and organization are especially urgent. I respectfully ask you to select and send the county magistrate quickly to take office, preside over governance, to stabilize the area, and also ask you to order the refugees who have fled from the recovered areas to return to their fields and villages, to strengthen the countryside, and strengthen the rear."</p>
<h3>Tang Shizun's Bandit Encirclement Strategy</h3>
<p>The bandits who retreated from Tong, except for those surrounded and those who had surrendered their arms, all retreated to the territory of Wanyuan, where they joined forces with the large gangs of bandits originally in Wanyuan. On the 25th, Tang Shizun telegraphed the headquarters to report the battle situation in Wanyuan, and also requested that the 3rd and 4th Routes be ordered to continue their advance in order to achieve the effect of gathering and annihilating the bandits.</p>

<h3>Fujian Province's Large-Scale Suppression of Pirates丨All Units Controlled by Wang Jingjiu</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The remaining Red bandits in the western and northern counties of Fujian are now surrounded by the main forces, and it will not be long before they can be completely wiped out. However, the coastal counties and islands in eastern Fujian, such as Fuqing, Lianjiang, Luoyuan, Ningde, Xiapu, Fuan, Fuding, and Pingtan, are intricate and complex, and are used as lairs by pirates. Some groups number hundreds, while others number only dozens. Sometimes they take ships to intercept passing vessels on the sea, and sometimes they land to loot coastal villages. When the army comes to suppress them, they flee to the sea. When warships patrol, they flee back to the mountains. This chasing and fleeing has made it difficult to eliminate them completely over the years. This spring, their power has become even more rampant, causing turmoil along the coast. It is found that eastern Fujian has always been a region rich in fish, salt, tea, and rice, and the people's livelihood has always been abundant. Due to this disturbance, production has declined greatly, resulting in a sharp reduction in the government's salt and fish tax revenue. In mid-June, the Mawei Naval Port Command specifically requested Sa Zhenbing to take the "Chu Tong" warship to patrol the islands in eastern Fujian, persuade the pirates to surrender, hand over their weapons, and be disbanded. The government will not pursue their past deeds and will give them a chance to reform. It was originally hoped that the prestige and virtue of the veteran general would move the pirates, but to no avail. Sa returned to the province the day before yesterday after a fruitless journey. The authorities, seeing that appeasement had no effect, decided that a large-scale suppression was necessary. Therefore, the local government convened Li Shijia, commander of the Mawei Naval Port; Wang Jingjiu, commander of the 87th Division; and Chen Qixuan, commander of the newly编10th Division, to discuss joint land and sea suppression methods. It was decided that the naval port would be responsible for the sea, dispatching gunboats specifically to intercept bandits fleeing from land into the sea. On land, the Wang and Chen Divisions would each send a brigade to cooperate with the 1st Brigade of the Marine Corps, the 9th Regiment of the Security Corps, and the Special Service Regiment to carry out the suppression, all under the command of Wang Jingjiu. Considering that eastern Fujian borders Zhejiang, the Zhejiang provincial government was specially requested to send troops to block the border. Wang Jingjiu has decided to lead his troops from the province to Funing within the next few days to direct everything. It has been decided to divide the bandit suppression forces into two parts: one part will be a static suppression force, guarding important areas and encircling any bandits who flee to them; the other part will be a pursuit force, specializing in searching for bandits in the islands and mountains and annihilating them. If they escape, they will be tracked and pursued. According to Wang's statistics, there are at least over two hundred bandit rifles in eastern Fujian, and it has been decided to pursue them all and distribute them to the counties to manage the Bao Wei Tuan (local defense corps) to enhance local self-defense. The bandit suppression headquarters for eastern Fujian is planned to be established in Ningde County, which is close to the sea and located in the center of eastern Fujian, making it very convenient for command and control. The entire 1st Regiment of the Security Corps from Zhejiang Province, which will participate in the joint suppression, has already arrived in Fuding and Shouning counties to deploy defense.

<h3>Bai Chongxi's Report in Guangdong on the Organization of the Guangxi People's Militia丨Three Goals of Militia Training</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since arriving in Guangdong, Bai Chongxi has been discussing major current affairs plans with the Guangdong authorities and He Jian, chairman of Hunan Province. On the 25th of this month, he reported on the organization and training of the Guangxi People's Militia at a weekly memorial service held by the Southwest Executive Department's Political Affairs Committee. The following is an excerpt of the main points of his speech:</p>
<p>The organization of the Guangxi People's Militia has been reformed six times to date. Its system divides the entire province into eight districts, all under the jurisdiction of the General Headquarters. Below the district are counties, below the county are townships, and below the township are villages. This is the vertical organization. As for the horizontal organization, there is a Regiment Affairs Design Committee, responsible for the military, political, economic, and cultural design work of the militia. The provincial government also sends personnel to participate. As for the execution of duties, no separate organs are established. Political matters are managed by the General Headquarters' Political Training Department, supplies are managed by the Logistics Department, and hygiene is managed by the Medical Department. Each militia district has a militia command, with a similar but simpler internal organization. The county level is even simpler, with only a staff officer and adjutant to handle everything. The county magistrate兼民团司令 (兼民團司令 - also serves as militia commander), and the deputy county magistrate则兼民团副司令(则兼民團副司令 - also serves as militia deputy commander). The district chief also serves as the reserve隊隊長(reserve隊隊長 - reserve team leader), the township head also serves as the在隊長(在隊長 - active team leader), and the village head also serves as the隊長(隊長 - team leader). The goal is to establish a link between the political and military affairs of the militia. Militarily, it is directly under the command of the General Headquarters, and politically, it is subject to the supervision and guidance of the provincial government. To facilitate communication between the province and the counties, an administrative supervisor is appointed, modeled after the old Dao Yin system. The mountain area militia commander also serves as the administrative supervisor. The goals of militia training are threefold: ① Military training aims to achieve self-defense capabilities; political training aims to achieve self-governance capabilities; and production education aims to achieve self-sufficiency capabilities. Previously, training for township and village militia below the county level was conducted by military instructors. Now, there are eighteen cadre training battalions, with an eight-month graduation period. In addition to military subjects, the curriculum includes political and production education. After graduation, trainees use what they have learned to train able-bodied men and manage local self-governance, farms, nurseries, and rural warehouses, so that they can be self-governing and self-sufficient in addition to self-defense. Based on these three points, starting from the cadre battalions, Guangxi has more than 24,000 villages in terms of self-defense. Each village has a reserve team of one hundred men, for a total of 24,000 reserve teams in the province, with 2.4 million team members. The purpose of self-defense is not only to defend the locality, but also to defend the province and the nation. In terms of self-governance, all township and village heads must undergo training and cannot be appointed without cadre training. They must have knowledge and skills comparable to those of a junior officer. To maintain their livelihood, it is stipulated that village heads receive a monthly salary of fifteen yuan, township heads receive twenty yuan, and district chiefs receive forty yuan. In terms of production education, all village heads must have a secondary education or have graduated from elementary school or undergone military training. Those who have received secondary education can also serve as elementary school principals or teachers, and those who have undergone military training can also serve as reserve team leaders. Schools will vigorously implement compulsory education, and night schools for adult men and women will be established. At the same time, the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry will lead the people in afforestation. There are more than 24,000 villages in the province, each with a public forest. After ten years, there may be hundreds of millions of trees. The ancient saying of "ten years to grow trees, a hundred years to cultivate people" will be put into practice. The village head is responsible for the construction of the village's politics and can also serve as the reserve team leader and the elementary school principal or teacher, integrating politics, education, and military affairs (i.e., militia training). Therefore, the essence of the Guangxi People's Militia is that military affairs account for only three-tenths of the total, while politics, economy, and culture account for seven-tenths. It is hoped that the spirit of military affairs will be promoted in politics, economy, and culture. (25th)</p>
<h3>Gao Yongsheng, Bandit Chief丨Photography After Execution丨Along with Seized Maps and Plans</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Military News: Gao Yongsheng, a bandit chief, successively served as the commander of the 16th Division of the Pseudo-16th Army and, most recently, as the acting commander of the Pseudo-Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Military Region, causing havoc in northwestern Jiangxi for several years and long overdue for execution. In April and May of this year, the bandit led his subordinates to disturb the border areas of Xiu, Tong, and Yi counties. The Yue, Feng, and Guo Divisions of the Western Route Army dispatched teams to encircle and suppress them from various directions. On June 7, Gao Yongsheng, realizing that the bandit forces could not hold out, led a remnant force of a dozen or so men from Tongsutping and fled north towards Tongcheng. While traveling near Caojialing in Quanfeng, he was captured by Li Binxi, the captain of the 9th Company of the Xiushui Security Corps, and temporarily held in a farmhouse on the ridge. Later, due to the darkness of the night and while awaiting his transfer, Gao Yongsheng claimed that he needed to relieve himself. Chen Rong, the squad leader, sent soldiers to hold his arms and escort him outside. Gao squatted down and lurched forward, attempting to escape. Due to the steep terrain, he fell into a deep ravine and died from injuries. The next day, Yang Lianxuan, the regimental commander of the 50th Division of the National Army, based on reports from local civilians, discovered the bandit's body near the port of his escape. He immediately sent troops to the regimental headquarters. Xiong Shiping, who had served Gao Yongsheng for four or five years and had been the Minister of Management of the Pseudo-Military Region Headquarters, and Chen Hongxu and You Sheng, former staff officers of the Pseudo-16th Division, and other surrendering personnel, all confirmed that the body was indeed Gao Yongsheng. After issuing a written pledge that "if there is any mistake, I am willing to be held accountable," the bandit's head was cut off and presented. Currently, the 50th Division Headquarters has used this to produce a film, along with the maps and planning documents found on Gao Yongsheng (which included a book on the issue of Leninism, on the cover of which Gao Yongsheng had personally written, "Zhi Cheng gave it to me, Yong Sheng, 3445"). All of these have been compiled and sent to the Nanchang Headquarters. The aforementioned film is the one taken by the 50th Division Headquarters after Gao Yongsheng fell and died, along with explanations. (June 30)</p>

<h3>Chen Diaoyuan Opens Up the Scenic Spot of Longdun in Wuyuan丨Using Soldiers to Build a Park</h3>
<p>Wuyuan Dispatch: Wuyi is the famous hometown of the sage Zhu Xi. The essence of the mountains and rivers is concentrated, resulting in many secluded and beautiful places. There are many ancient sites, all of which are beautiful. Longdun is also one of the famous scenic spots in this county, located north of the county seat. It has ancient sites such as the Xishan First Pavilion (溪山第一樓) and the Wisdom Well (智慧井). According to legend, there were previously two coffins buried here, filled with gold and silver. The land is very empty, with the mound on top, protruding high like a city wall, covering dozens of acres, with dense forests and beautiful scenery. However, the people of the county did not know how to protect it, and it was very desolate. More than ten years ago, local notable Jiang Xianglan略事修葺 (略事修葺 - made some repairs), but the work was not completed. Nearby residents often dumped garbage in the open space, piling it up like mountains. Broken stones and weeds were visible everywhere, turning the famous scenic area into a foul-smelling and dirty swamp. This time, Chen Diaoyuan, Commander of the Reserve Army, moved his headquarters to Wuyuan. Seeing the desolation of this scenic spot, he believed that it was necessary to develop it. Therefore, he ordered the Special Service Battalion stationed in the city and the 3rd Battalion of the 727th Regiment to each draw a number of soldiers to remove the accumulated broken stones and garbage, smooth out the uneven ground, and use the open space of Xishan Second Pavilion (溪山第二樓) to build two basketball and tennis courts, construct a park, and plant flowers and trees, specifically for public entertainment. The trees in the mound were left standing in a circle around the perimeter, and the rest were thinned out. The branches were trimmed to resemble emerald canopies. The mound was paved with sand, and a pavilion was built in the center for visitors to rest and enjoy a panoramic view of the mountains and rivers surrounding the city. After more than a month of operation, the work is now nearing completion.</p>
<h3>Northwest Inspection Notes - Arrival in Ningxia</h3>
<p>Our Special Correspondent - Geng Ya</p>
<p>At eight o'clock on the morning of the tenth, the official departure from Lingdu. There are boundaries between the Sui(yuan) and Ning(xia) camel caravans. Those coming to Ning from Baotou mostly unload their goods at the river, and then hire laborers to enter the city. The camels return to the grasslands immediately. If they cross the river, they have to pay additional Ningxia province cargo dues, which can amount to more than three silver dollars per head. Sometimes, there are also cases of forcibly requisitioning laborers under the pretext of not paying the camel dues. Local camel caravans, in order to compete for business, inevitably create various inconveniences. This situation is not only true for Sui camels, but also for Ning camels going to Baotou. In order to avoid paying dues and being requisitioned, the camel drivers originally planned to rush to the riverside last night and return before dawn, but fearing that the camels would not be able to bear the strain, they planned to leave tonight. Later, Mr. Zhu and Mr. Zhou told them that they were familiar with the tax authorities and that no accidents would occur, so they changed their plan to depart early this morning. However, the camel drivers, mindful of past experiences, were still uneasy. In addition to sending someone ahead to observe, they also hid the camel bells and proceeded silently, like stealthily attacking an enemy camp. After traveling thirty li, we reached the end of the grasslands, and the Yellow River, which we had been separated from for more than ten days, was now clearly visible. After another ten li, the mountains rose and fell, and the gullies were deep and sunken. The rocks were jagged and barren, and no plants grew. Turning down, we reached the riverside. Goods were unloaded and piled up like mountains, making it difficult to cross completely. I, along with Mr. Zhou and Mr. Bai, crossed over to Tongchangbao first and hired mules and horses to enter Ning the next day.</p>
<p>The fort is eight li from the river. Along the way, the forests are vast, the ditches are crisscrossed, the wheat fields are green, and the wildflowers are competing to bloom. The summer feeling is strong, unlike the grasslands east of the river, where the white sand and yellow grass still have the flavor of winter. Is it not "one river divides east and west, with different temperatures"? We spent the night in a flatbread shop opened by a Hui person. Several couplets were hanging on the wall, with no congratulatory phrases at the top and only the name of someone who offered congratulations at the bottom, also crooked and unsightly. When asked, we learned that "even if you offer money, no one will write for you." Practical gifts are too numerous to mention. To focus on vain appearances here, it just shows how unbreakable the habit of tradition is. The owner prepared dinner, which was still palatable. We drank "Gaiwan tea," which contained brick tea, white and red sugar, dates, and dried persimmons. It was fragrant, sweet, and thirst-quenching. If it is for marrying a new wife, lotus seeds, almonds, grapes, sesame seeds, longans, and lychees are added, which is called "flower tea." It is said that it was invented by a concubine of Helian Bobo of Western Xia. Later generations only drink perfume when entertaining guests, and cannot eat all the tea leaves, cooking and discarding them as they go. This is also a waste in banquets.</p>
<p>The next morning, we took a short stroll around the fort. The residents' houses were neat and tidy, and their bodies were strong. Most of them were Hui people. If the doors and windows were old and dilapidated and the spirit was weak, you could tell that they were Han Chinese. Hui people are mostly hardworking and do not have the habit of smoking, while Han Chinese "do not smoke and become lazy when they have money." Their manifestations in life are naturally different. This is not only a personal observation, but also recognized by the people of Ning. O Han Chinese, since we are aware of this, when will we stir and improve ourselves? A Qingzhen Temple (mosque). Sun Dianying's notice to the people of Ning was still posted on the door, which roughly stated, "All my officers and soldiers are not allowed to enter, in order to maintain military reputation and avoid hurting national feelings." It is known that Sun's army has advanced to this point, but has not engaged in fighting here, saving the city from the scourge of war. The fields here can be irrigated with water from the Tang Canal. The quality is fertile and the yield is abundant. The average land price is 60,000 "zhang" per mu, worth 100 yuan. This is called "top-quality land that can grow opium." If it can only grow grain, the price is reduced to 60 yuan. When renting land from landlords, no "ya zu" is paid. The amount paid is mostly the standard of four for the landlord and six for the tenant. At the corners of the fields, there are clusters of Hui graves, rectangular in shape, rising a foot above the ground, with flat tops and graded edges, made of earth and lime, and planted with willow trees. Catkins were falling.</p>
<p>There is an elementary school in the fort. The door is Western-style architecture, inscribed with "Hua Yu Chun Feng." Inside are three or four flat houses. Students were holding books such as the National Language, Common Knowledge, Analects, Mencius, Three Character Classic, and Hundred Family Surnames, and reciting them freely. When asked, "Where is the teacher?" A student pointed to a room and said, "There. Teacher Li." When we entered, two men were bowing their heads and hugging their knees, feigning sleep on the kang. The students woke them up, so we first asked an old man, "Your honorable surname?" He replied, "I dare not, my surname is Li." The next question was to the young man, and the answer was the same. When asked, "Is one the principal and one the teacher?" The old man answered, "There is only one teacher, myself. He (pointing to the young man) is my son, helping to fill the red ink. The principal is the first surname in the Hundred Family Surnames. If there is no important matter, he does not easily come to school." When asked, "How is the teaching?" He answered, "There are more than forty students, and their levels are very uneven. If we do not teach the Four Books, the parents do not welcome it. If we teach all the Four Books, it conflicts with the regulations of the Education Bureau. Therefore, new and old subjects are taught in a mixed manner. There is singing, and there is gymnastics. If we abolish the old books and read all the new books, not only will there be no language, but there will also be no literary talent. Even when friends meet for the first time and discuss surnames, they often do not understand each other. May I ask, sir (referring to the reporter), what is your business in Ning? Hearing that you have a Southern accent, the heads of the Finance and Education Departments of Ning Province are also Southerners. If you seek employment, there must be good opportunities." At this point, the shop owner called us. We went out and saw that the luggage left at the river had arrived, so we packed up and set off.</p>
<p>After five li, we reached Tonggui Fort, with a population of seventy or eighty, mostly Hui and one tenth Han. When Sun's army invaded Ning, they searched for food here. Later, after their defeat, it seemed that several poor households, suspected of colluding with the enemy, were suddenly murdered by people with white headscarves out for revenge. Fortunately, the authorities quickly paid attention to this, and this unfortunate event was quietly suppressed. From here on, there were more forts and hamlets, and the sounds of chickens and dogs could be heard. The water conservancy and soil were fertile, surpassing those in the northwest. Plum and peach trees were bearing fruit, as large as thumbs, making one's mouth water. If one were to pass here in the third month of spring, the blue waves and good fields, with falling petals, would certainly give one the feeling of being in a peach blossom spring. "Ningxia is the Jiangnan of the northern frontier," this saying is indeed true. Among the crops in the fields, poppies accounted for about 35 percent, wheat and miscellaneous grains accounted for about 30 percent, and uncultivated land accounted for about 35 percent. Most of this was waiting for autumn grain planting, and a small part had become fallow land for three or four years. Farmers, men and women, wearing cogongrass hats, holding small hoes several inches long, were kneeling in the poppy fields, weeding.</p>
<p>After twenty li, we saw twin pagodas in the distance, towering into the sky. Mr. Bai told us, "This is the North Pagoda. Sun's army was defeated under it when they attacked the city. That is the West Pagoda, which is in the city and has been damaged by earthquakes. Once the twin pagodas are seen, the city of Ning is near." After traveling another fifteen li, passing a salt marsh and the Gaotai Temple, which was being demolished, we reached the East Gate of Ningxia. The city wall was about three zhang high. The outer layer of bricks and stones had been dismantled and added to the parapets to prevent Sun's army from attacking and climbing the walls. The inner earth was exposed, making it very solid and difficult to attack. Three armed soldiers guarded the city gate. They ordered us to get off the donkey to inspect and presented our passports to the platoon leader for inspection. The platoon leader sat high on the city tower, his battle wounds not yet healed, leaning on his cane and asking a few questions before allowing us to enter the city. There was only one hotel in the city, and the wounded soldiers had not yet been moved out. Mr. Bai invited us to stay at his home, and his hospitality was deeply appreciated. In the evening, we accepted Mr. Zhou's invitation to bathe at the "First Pool." Looking at ourselves in the mirror, our beards and hair were long, and our faces were unrecognizable. We could not help but laugh, and our reflection laughed too.</p>

<h3>Detailed Rules for the Ping-Shen Through Train丨Direct Passenger Ticket Twelve Yuan, Seven Jiao, Five Fen丨Japanese Military Police in Peiping Request to Accompany the Train to Shenyang</h3>
<p>Peiping Dispatch: The Ping-Shen through train is scheduled to depart simultaneously from Peiping and Shenyang tomorrow morning (the 1st). The first train from Peiping will be transferred from Fengtai to Qianmen Station at 12:00 tonight (the 30th). All service personnel on the train must report to the stationmaster's office at 7:00 tomorrow morning (the 1st), and board the train under the leadership of the train conductor. Through train tickets have been on sale in Peiping starting today (the 30th), and most of the purchasers are Japanese. The Peiping Japanese Military Police Department suddenly sent a military policeman named Zhushang to the East Station this morning to state that the Japanese military police intended to send personnel to accompany the through train departing on July 1st, and requested seats. Because the station had not received orders from the Railway Bureau, it replied that it would have to consult with the Railway Bureau. The military policeman left without getting what he wanted. It is heard that the Railway Bureau will negotiate with the Japanese side on this matter. Regarding the Yuguan side, the Oriental Travel Agency is currently still renovating its premises, and has not been formally established. Therefore, it is temporarily borrowing the Yuguan Station building for office use. All ticket documents, etc., are printed only in Tianjin and were sent from Tianjin to Yuguan this morning (the 30th). Yin Tong, director of the Beining Railway Bureau, will report to the Military Branch of the Government Reorganization Council on the progress of the through train matter after it has been completed. He is scheduled to come to Peiping from Tianjin tomorrow evening (the 1st).</p>

<h3>He Jian's Visit to Guangdong: Exchanging Views with Leaders on National Defense and Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, recently arrived in Guangdong and has been extremely busy with social engagements. On the 22nd, He visited Deng Zeru, Xiao Focheng, and others at the Southwest Political Council. He Jian emphasized the necessity of national unity and sincere solidarity in the face of external threats. Deng and others also considered suppressing the communists and resisting Japan as the urgent tasks for maintaining internal stability and defending against external aggression. He took his leave around noon. At 2 PM, Chen Jitang, Jiang Bocheng, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Xue Yue, Li Yangjing, Yu Hanmou, Miao Peinan, Li Hanhun, Deng Longguang, and others arrived at Tuisi Garden to visit He. A conference of representatives from various bandit suppression armies was held at Tuisi Garden. All attendants were excluded, and security was extremely tight. It is rumored that the discussion centered on coordinating defense in South China and linking up various routes for bandit suppression, with simultaneous emphasis on national defense and bandit suppression. The bandit suppression plan will adhere to the plan set by the headquarters, with a large-scale operation by the five provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, and Jiangxi to be completed within three months. Regarding national defense construction, the Yangtze River ports of Hunan and Jiangxi, the coastal ports of Fujian and Guangdong, and the southern border of Guangxi should be actively fortified, and efforts should be made to improve inter-provincial transportation to facilitate mutual support. Regarding cooperation between the party and government, it is said that He and Jiang also placed great importance on this issue. The meeting adjourned around 4 PM. At 10 AM on the 23rd, He Jian openly met with a group of reporters at Tuisi Garden and issued a written statement: "(1) I came to Guangdong to participate in the bandit suppression conference for the Second Phase of the Fourth Route Army and to discuss coordination between the Southwest routes with Commander-in-Chief Chen. (2) During this visit to Guangdong, I met with the three Commanders-in-Chief Chen (Jitang), Li (Zongren), and Bai (Chongxi), and key figures in the Southwest Party and government, and generally finalized various plans. (3) Rumors that Liu Zhi will be transferred to govern Hunan are completely unfounded. (4) My opinion on the current situation is to resist strong neighbors externally and suppress the communist bandits internally, first suppressing the bandits and then facing external threats. (5) After the West Route Army suppressed Xiao Ke, Gao Yongsheng, Kong Hechong, and other forces, the first, second, and third columns of the West Route Army are still actively searching for and suppressing bandits to prevent future troubles. (6) The meeting with the military representatives in Guangdong was very satisfactory. (7) I have exchanged opinions with everyone during the bandit suppression conference of the Fourth Route Army. (8) The Hunan Provincial Assembly representatives telegraphed requesting the abolition of the Southwest Executive Department and the Political Council. I had no prior knowledge of this. I am only responsible for maintaining local affairs, and I have not inquired about other matters. (9) I went to Nanchang last month to meet with Chairman Jiang to report on the bandit suppression situation of the West Route Army. I stayed in Nanchang for a week and returned to Hunan on the 5th of this month. I departed from Changsha on the 18th to come to Guangdong." That afternoon, after attending a banquet hosted by the Guangdong Provincial Government, He Jian drove to the New Asia Hotel on Xidi to visit Jiang Bocheng for an all-night conversation, only returning to Tuisi Garden for breakfast at 7 AM the next morning. In the morning, He and his entourage paid respects to the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang. He also visited the Military and Political School in Yantang. In the afternoon, he attended a welcome party for Hunan fellow villagers in Guangdong. In the evening, he attended a banquet at the Nanyuan Restaurant at the invitation of Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi. During He's visit to Guangdong, Hu Hanmin, who was in Hong Kong, sent his daughter, Hu Mulan, and his secretary, Wang Yangchong, from Hong Kong to Guangzhou to invite He to Hong Kong for a meeting. It is reported that He agreed to the invitation and went to Hong Kong to meet with Hu before taking a steamer to Shanghai and then returning to Hunan. (June 25th)</p>

<p>Explanation: (1) Hubei Province originally established public security bureaus in seven cities, including Yichang, Shashi, Xindi, Wuxue, Laohekou, Fancheng, and Shayang. The expenses for these bureaus were generally raised locally, collected and used by each bureau. Therefore, the taxes and levies collected were particularly excessive. Later, the name of the city was abolished and changed to direct jurisdiction under the Civil Affairs Department. The expenses and revenues were neither provincial nor county-level, which was inconsistent with the financial system and the principle of unified revenue and expenditure. The Civil Affairs Department was consulted and approved to transfer the taxes and levies originally collected by the public security bureaus to the tax bureaus for collection. The period from March to the end of June of this year was the reorganization period, and July 1st and beyond was the implementation period for abolishing taxes and levies. A list was submitted for review and implementation, dividing the original taxes and levies into three categories: those to be abolished, those to be merged, and those to be handled otherwise. (1) The abolished taxes and levies listed in this table include a total of 27 items, with a total value of over 286,800 Yuan.</p>

<h3>Reiterate Independent Request for Education Funds</h3>
<p>The Provincial Department of Finance is strictly implementing the county treasury system, requiring all counties to turn over all taxes and levies, regardless of who collects them, to the county government for unified revenue and expenditure starting from July 1st. County Magistrate Jin has appointed a candidate to be the Director of the Tax Affairs Office to take over and manage this matter. However, education funding has always been independent, and it is feared that it will be affected by this change. Therefore, Zhu Zhaosheng, the Director of the Education Bureau of this county, has taken the lead in contacting the directors of the education bureaus of seventeen counties, including Jiangdu, to issue a joint telegram stating that while they should comply with the Provincial Department of Finance's order regarding the method for revenue, expenditure, and storage of county funds, which is to be implemented from July 1st, this method is clearly inconsistent with Article 13 of the late Sun Yat-sen's Party Platform and the National Government's Orders No. 123 and the Executive Yuan's Order No. 374, which guarantee the independence of education funds. According to Article 2 of the Provincial Organization Law, provincial orders and provincial standalone laws are limited to not conflicting with central laws. This method overturns the established independence of education and clearly violates central laws. They have requested the Provincial Government to reconsider and remove education funding from the scope of the method to preserve education and comply with the law. They have also telegraphed the County Magistrate requesting him to postpone implementation to avoid disputes.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Severe Drought Raises Concerns About Drinking Water</h3>
<p>Suzhou has been experiencing continuous drought with no rain. Rivers and waterways are drying up and becoming murky, and many public water kitchens throughout the city have closed. The issue of drinking water for citizens is gradually becoming a problem. Merchants and residents in areas such as the East, West, and Central Markets are gathering to discuss dredging the rivers and developing artesian wells to provide relief. Meanwhile, the Taoist Association has also started a ritual to pray for rain at the Leizu Hall in the Yuanmiao Temple since yesterday (July 1st). At 2 PM yesterday, over a hundred villagers from the North Xuejing Township carried a small white dragon made of pine and cypress branches into the city to pray for rain. They beat gongs and drums and set off firecrackers along the way. The procession also included performances of various dramas such as Little Green and Bai Niangniang flooding Jinshan, employing hired beggars with painted faces to play various water spirits. The scene was extremely lively. However, by evening, the sun was still shining brightly, and there was no sign of rain. The indoor temperature still exceeded one hundred degrees.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Large Sum of Money Found in a Latrine</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a traveler from Zhenjiang was traveling to Suzhou by train. He was carrying a baggage and a leather briefcase. When the train arrived at Wuxi Station, the traveler was waiting to hand it over. The traveler glanced out of the window. In a flash, his baggage and leather briefcase suddenly disappeared. He immediately reported the incident to investigator Zhou. Around 11 AM, a person wearing short clothes was seen hurrying into a latrine on Tangqiao Lane with a briefcase wrapped in oil paper. Zhang Xueda's son, Anbao (ten years old, a second-grade student at Jiyu Elementary School), saw this and followed him. The person became even more alarmed and threw the briefcase into the latrine. Anbao ran to tell his mother, Huang, who sent someone to retrieve it. Inside, they found over four hundred yuan in paper money, a passbook with a deposit of one thousand yuan at the Yao Zhongji Savings Bank in Nanjing, two stock certificates from the Wang Heji pawnshop in Zhenjiang worth eight thousand yuan, six business cards of Yao Qinqiu, and a fan and photographs. All the items were handed over to Zhao Zixin, the mayor of Beitangdongzhen, for safekeeping. Mayor Zhao posted a notice to claim the items and sent a telegram to the Yutai pawnshop in Zhenjiang and the Huiji Savings Bank in Nanjing to inquire. It is said that the loser's surname is Wang.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Impersonating Chief Inspector Arrested and Sent to the Bureau</h3>
<p>A traveler came to the Hongyun Inn in this county on the 28th.</p>
<p>Claiming to be Li Biao, the vanguard of the Shen Public Security Bureau Chief, he came here to serve as Chief Inspector. As a result, general active police personnel all went to pay their respects. It was later learned that Shen had submitted his resignation to the province, and only then did they realize that this person was an imposter. The public security substation then went to arrest Li. Only then did they learn that his real name was Diao Yushu, and he ran a paper goods store in Suzhou. There were three people who came to apply for positions in the Public Security Bureau. As for talking to newspaper reporters, it was a temporary oversight, etc. As a result, he was sent to the general bureau for verification.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Filial Son Gambles, Beats and Injures Elderly Mother</h3>
<p>It has been widely rumored that Xu Sanmao, an old farmer from the Shengtangyuan in Youchegang, aged seventy, was beaten in the waist by his son A Wu, resulting in his death. It was considered a rare occurrence. Unexpectedly, another case of filial impiety occurred yesterday in the Sanjiacun area. It turns out that Pu Guijin, a farmer in that area,</p>
<p>is still wealthy. He married a wife, Ji, and had two sons. The elder son, Shouguan, had already married. A neighbor, Wu, set up a gambling den and often invited Shouguan to gamble. As a result, he abandoned his family affairs and disregarded everything. Guijin was very angry, so</p>
<p>yesterday he told his old wife to call him. Unexpectedly, Shouguan became furious and, holding a long bench, rushed home and threw the bench at his mother's head. Immediately, blood gushed out and she fainted. Her life is in danger. The unfilial son Shouguan was</p>
<p>bound by his father and sent to the local court to be severely punished according to the law.</p>

<p>The reduction or increase in tariff rates in this new tariff</p>
<p>is entirely determined by the domestic and international trade situation. Luxury goods such as cosmetics, woolen goods, consumables, tobacco, alcohol, hardware, and chemicals will be appropriately increased. In addition, more than twenty kinds of goods and raw materials for which there are no domestic substitutes will be reduced. The reduction range for cotton yarn is 5%. The sales of rayon in China have increased year by year, but due to the high tariff rate, most of it is smuggled, which is not a good policy. Therefore, the new tariff also specifically reduces it to prevent abuses.</p>
<h3>Implemented Today</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs in this port has already received instructions from the General Customs Administration to implement the new tariff starting yesterday. However, since it was Sunday, it will be officially implemented today. All ships carrying goods to China that declare customs starting today will follow the new tariff. In addition, all customs offices across the country and the Great Wall outposts in North China will also implement the new tariff from today to ensure uniformity.</p>
<h3>Japanese Business Activities</h3>
<p>The Japanese side attaches great importance to this revision of the new tariff. The other day, Ambassador Arima specially visited Wang, Jiang and others to inquire about this matter for a long time. Now that the new tariff has been implemented, the Japanese are quite pleased. According to the Shenshi News Agency reporter's inquiry yesterday to the Japanese Embassy in this port, the Japanese government expressed goodwill towards the establishment of this new tariff. Japanese businessmen in this port are now actively preparing to transport goods to China for dumping. According to general observations, after the implementation of the new tariff, Japanese goods will become even more abundant in our city's markets.</p>
<h3>Rong Zongjing Talks</h3>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that the reporter then inquired at the residence of Rong Zongjing, a giant in the industrial and commercial circles. According to him, although the details of the new customs tariff revised by the Ministry of Finance have not been obtained, it is rumored that the import tariff on cotton yarn will be reduced by 5.1%, which will have a great impact on China's cotton spinning industry. The Japanese cotton spinning industry has always been the leader in East Asia. If the tariff rate is further reduced, it will create an opportunity for them to dump goods on us. China's cotton spinning industry has been lifeless in recent years due to the global economic downturn. If it suffers another major blow from the dumping of foreign goods, it will inevitably collapse completely. For the sake of their own interests, cotton spinning merchants have jointly discussed with the National Economic Commission's Cotton Industry Control Association. They all believe that the Ministry of Finance's move is greatly detrimental to the cotton spinning industry. Therefore, they plan to send representatives to Beijing to ask the Ministry of Finance to carefully consider the reduction of the cotton yarn import tariff or directly withdraw the order.</p>
<h3>Pinghan Railway: Borrowing Money from the Banking Sector: Both Parties Negotiate Collateral</h3>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that the Ministry of Railways, in order to start reorganizing the entire Pinghan Railway and reconstructing the Yellow River Railway Bridge, has decided to borrow a large amount of money from the banking sector in this city in order to complete the reorganization plan. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Wu Yunzhai Talks About Pinghan Loan</h3>
<p>The loan is represented by Jin Cheng and Salt Industry Banks. The Ministry of Railways is responsible for contacting them. Shenshi</p>
<p>News Agency reporter specially visited Wu Yunzhai, manager of Jin Cheng Bank, yesterday. According to him, the Ministry of Railways is indeed in the process of borrowing money from the banking syndicate in this city to reorganize the Pinghan Railway. The persons in charge of contacting both parties are Zhou Zuomin, general manager of Jin Cheng Bank, and Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways. The amount of the loan is 30 million yuan. In the future, in addition to Jin Cheng and Salt Industry Banks as representative banks, other major Chinese commercial banks will be united to form a banking syndicate to handle the matter. The issue of loan collateral is currently being negotiated. Once the issue is resolved, the contract can be officially signed.</p>
<h3>Allocation Method for Loan Use</h3>
<p>According to another source, the 30 million loan from the Ministry of Railways to the banking sector will be used entirely for the reorganization of various facilities on the Pinghan Railway, including: ㈠ Purchasing 500,000 sleepers; ㈡ Purchasing approximately 90,000 tons of steel rails; ㈢ Replacing bridges in the southern section and repairing the Yellow River Iron Bridge; ㈣ Adding equipment to the entire line's machine shop; ㈤ Installing long-distance telephones; ㈥ Repairing locomotives and passenger and freight cars. The above plan is scheduled to be completed within five years.</p>
<h3>He Jian and Xue Yue Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday: Said the Results of the Anti-Banditry Conference in Guangdong Were Satisfactory: Waiting for Chairman Chiang's Reply Before Visiting</h3>
<p>He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the West Route Bandit Suppression Army, went from Hunan to Guangdong at the end of last month to discuss ways to thoroughly suppress and eliminate the remaining bandits with Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, etc. The results were satisfactory. Because he urgently needs to report the progress of the negotiations to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>, he took the Canadian Empress of Canada from Hong Kong on June 29 and arrived in Shanghai at about 4:00 pm yesterday. He will visit Chiang within a few days. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Welcoming Personnel</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, many people went to the ship to welcome Mr. He, including</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng's secretary Tang Shixuan, Mayor of Shanghai, Zhu Shaoliang, head of Gansu Province, Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Ye Kaixin, Army Commander, Yang Hu, Chief of the City Security Department, Wen Hongen, Chief of the Public Security Bureau, Luo Jixiong, Chief of Staff of the Songhu Garrison Command, Yang Dezhao, representative of Chen Jitang of Guangdong, Tang Zhaoshi, Secretary of the Customs Superintendent's Office, and Mr. He's two daughters, as well as Zhang Zhongjun, Director of the Beijing Office of the West Route Headquarters of the Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei Bandit Suppression Army, and more than sixty other people.</p>
<h3>Important Officials Accompanying:</h3>
<p>In addition to Xue Yue, the Sixth Commander of the Central Route Bandit Suppression Army, who came to Shanghai on the same ship as Commander-in-Chief He from Guangdong on behalf of Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng to discuss important official matters, there were also Ling Zhang, Director of the West Route Bandit Suppression Headquarters Office, Xiong Shiding, Adjutant, Zhang Peiqian, Representative of the West Route stationed in Guangdong, and more than a dozen attendants.</p>
<h3>He's Speech</h3>
<p>The reporter had a brief conversation with Mr. He when he was taking the Jinghui ferry across the Pu River yesterday. According to him, this time I went south to discuss with Commander-in-Chief Chen of the South Route Army and Li (Zongren) Bai (Chongxi) on the practical methods of the joint suppression of bandits by the Southwest Route Army in order to eliminate the remaining bandits as soon as possible. The results were extremely satisfactory. The South Route Bandit Suppression Army originally dispatched four divisions of troops to be deployed in the front and the southern Jiangxi area. Now, after consultation, it has been decided to increase the troops by ten regiments to strictly block the area to prevent escape. The West Route Bandit Suppression Army has fourteen divisions. The bandit suppression military affairs and the blockade of the bandit areas have made considerable progress. It is expected that the remaining bandits in all areas will be completely eliminated within two months.</p>
<h3>Meeting with Hu in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>This time I went to Guangdong, in addition to the orders of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss the bandit suppression military affairs, I did not have any political mission. When I arrived in Hong Kong from Guangdong the other day (29th), because I had not met with Mr. Hu Zhantang for a long time, I went to visit him, but it was very brief, and I said goodbye because of the ship's schedule. Overall, the results of the discussions with all parties in Guangdong this time are that the military and political authorities in the southwest are now fully cooperating under the guidance of the central government's overall plan.</p>
<h3>Visiting Chiang in a Few Days</h3>
<p>I have not yet decided when I will visit Chiang. After arriving in Shanghai, I will send a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report and ask for the date and location of the meeting. After receiving the reply, I will stay in Shanghai for about three or four days and then go to visit Chiang to report on the process of the anti-banditry conference in the south.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Banquet</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu hosted a banquet for Mr. He and others at his residence on Haig Road at 8:00 pm last night. Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Yang Hu, Chief of the City Security Department, Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and leaders from all walks of life accompanied them. The guests and hosts dispersed happily at around 10:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Drafting a Speech</h3>
<p>When Mr. He arrived at the hotel, a reporter from the Far East News Agency went to see him. He sent Zhang Zhongjun, his representative in Beijing, to meet with him, saying that in addition to the brief conversation with you on the ship, there are still many points that are being drafted in a written speech, which will be released at 12:00 noon tomorrow (that is, this afternoon).</p>
<h3>Another Batch of Landlords Voluntarily Reduce Rent</h3>
<p>The Shanghai market is sluggish. Many landlords have voluntarily reduced rents one after another. Now it is learned that some landlords continue to voluntarily reduce rents. The details are as follows: ㈠ Tongda Company, Qingfengsheng, and other businesses on Minzu Road in the South City have recently entrusted the South District Rent Reduction Association to write to landlords such as Lei Yushang to request rent reduction due to sluggish business and high rent. Now the landlord Wang Lingjun has personally agreed to notify the company to reduce the original rent by 20 yuan per month. Lei Yushang has sent representative Zhao Deru to the South District Rent Reduction Association to discuss rent reduction methods. ㈡ After the establishment of the Rent Reduction Branch in Taipingli, Qulimalu, Nanshi District, it has actively engaged in the rent reduction movement without any slack. Recently, representatives from the landlord's side and representatives from the branch, Li Yuanyu and Jin Chuxiang, have mediated the rent reduction. After the members of the branch voted in a general meeting, they decided to reduce the rent by 15%, which has been agreed and signed by both parties. ㈢ Dunbenli on Yuanfang Road, Zhoujiazui Road in the Public Concession, is the property handled by Dunju Bank. It was newly built last year. After the rent reduction movement, the li took the lead in reducing rent. Now, after the organization of the Rent Reduction Branch in the li, it requested the landlord to reduce the rent. After an agreement between the two parties, the landlord decided to reduce the rent by another 5%. ㈣ Taixingli on Jiangyin Street has dozens of buildings. It launched a rent reduction this month. Under the leadership of the branch representative, after several discussions with Tu Peisun, the representative of the landlord Taixingyi Coal Company, the landlord's reply has been received, allowing 25% discount on the actual rent. The methods are as follows: (A) The original rent is 13.3 yuan per room per month, and the actual rent is now set at 10 yuan. (B) 14.3 yuan, actual rent is 11 yuan, 18.3 yuan, actual rent is 13.5 yuan. ㈤ No. 827 Tiantong Road has several shops, which are the property of Mr. Chen Yanlin. Mr. Chen has recently seen the sluggish market and, in order to show sympathy for the difficulties of businessmen, has voluntarily reduced the rent by 15 yuan, setting an example for the city's owners. Mr. Chen is a scholar who studies real estate and has written a book called "Complete Book of Real Estate", which has been published and has many insights into the rise and fall of society. Now he generously voluntarily reduces the rent, which shows his great vision and deep understanding of the pathological state of society. It is also learned that there are still a batch of landlords who will voluntarily reduce the rent, and they are currently negotiating.</p>
<h3>Busy Sino-Japanese Wireless Telegraphs: Shameless Chinese Compete to Order Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese communication of the International Telecommunications Bureau has a very good business, with an average of more than 300 communications per day, and the trend is increasing. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the reasons are as follows:</p>
<h3>Competing to Order Goods from Japan</h3>
<p>Sino-Japanese trade has recently reduced the cost of Japanese merchants due to the low Japanese gold, so they have vigorously imported to our country. On the other hand, our country's industry and commerce are young, and the quality and</p>
<p>price of our products are far from being able to compete with Japanese goods. At the same time, most merchants are profit-oriented, so they are competing to order goods from Japan. As a result, Sino-Japanese telegrams are increasing day by day.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Capacity of Submarine Cables</h3>
<p>Before the direct communication between China and Japan, Sino-Japanese telegrams were all sent by Great Eastern and Great Northern. However, the submarine cables of the company</p>
<p>and the Sino-Japanese line are part of the Sino-US line, so they are very busy. Moreover,</p>
<p>the Japanese consider that the Sino-Japanese communication fee is equally shared by both China and Japan. If it is sent by the Great Northern Company, the Japanese side will get very little benefit. From the starting point of patriotism, they mostly trade with the International Telecommunications Bureau. As for the Japanese telecommunications company, although it has submarine cables, it is only enough for the news telegrams of the Japanese newspaper.</p>
<h3>The Third Session of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: The Executive and Supervisory Committee Took Office Yesterday Morning: And Elected Yu Zuoting as Chairman: Xu Ji and Four Others as Standing Committee Members</h3>
<p>The third session of the Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce took office yesterday morning at 10:00 am, took an oath, and mutually elected five standing committee members, and elected Yu Zuoting as chairman. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Committee Members Present</h3>
<p>Executive Committee members Xu Jiqing, Yu Zuoting, Ma Jiliang, Zheng Zenan, Ge</p>
<p>Jiechen, Zheng Chenghu, Pan Xusheng, Ke Gan Chen, Ye Yin San, Chen Xiaodie, Jin Runxiang, Chen Zheqing, Hu Xiyuan, and other fourteen people, Supervisory Committee members Pei Yunqing, Fang Jiaobo, Shen Tianxin, Luo Qinghua, and other four people.</p>
<h3>Meeting Situation</h3>
<p>After the bell rang for the meeting, Xu Ji was publicly elected as the temporary chairman, Yan E-sheng as the secretary, Zhu Boyuan as the recorder, and the master of ceremonies respectfully read the will. Then the newly appointed executive and supervisory committee members raised their hands to take the oath of office. Next, Tao Baichuan, representative of the Municipal Party Department, and Wu Huanru, representative of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, gave training speeches. Then the executive committee members mutually elected five standing committee members, and then the standing committee members elected one chairman, and the supervisory committee members Luo Qinghua, Pei Yunqing, Fang Jiaobo, and Shen Tianxin counted the votes. After the election, the resignation of Wang Xiaolai and Wang Yansong from the Supervisory Committee was discussed. It was resolved to earnestly retain them unanimously. Photo taken and adjourned.</p>
<h3>Oath of Office</h3>
<p>We swear with sincerity to accept the entrustment of the members' congress, to be loyal and work hard in our positions, to seek welfare for the city's merchants, to reduce pain, to obey national laws and regulations, to abide by group discipline, and if we violate the oath, we are willing to be subject to the most severe sanctions. We swear.</p>
<h3>Representative's Speech</h3>
<p>㈠ Tao Baichuan of the Municipal Party Department said in his speech, "You are all honest and sincere leaders of the business community. This time you take office, the responsibility is very heavy, because in the past four years, whether international or domestic, we have been in a very critical period. The international situation has changed greatly. For example, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations will inevitably lead to conflicts over the ruled islands in the future. Russia's five-year plan has been completed, and their heavy industry has progressed very quickly. Russia's economic power is developing day by day, so now a country must not only work hard in politics, but also work hard in economic power. Moreover, European countries are now in dispute over the Saar region, and the final result will depend on the results of the 1936 election. When the 5:5:3 ratio of the navies of Britain, the United States, and Japan cannot be reconciled, it is enough to trigger a world war. In this critical period, we can only endure hardship and work hard, work together, and develop industry and commerce. In these three or four years, it is the biggest key to building peace. Now the bandit areas have been gradually suppressed, and the whole country will be unified soon. We should engage in production. We already know the seriousness of the international situation. The dispute is not in the Atlantic, but in the Pacific, especially in China, and even more so in Shanghai. So our responsibility is very important and very difficult. You are the central figures in industry and commerce, and you are the first to bear the brunt. The so-called misfortune and happiness are closely related. Therefore, I hope that you will take responsibility and work hard. I remember when I was in school, there were often sentences such as 'winning the battlefield' and 'winning the business battlefield'. Now it can be said to be a very special period for winning the business battlefield. Wu Zhi Lao said, 'He takes a gun to hit me, and I also use a gun to hit him.' Now everyone pays attention to industry and commerce and takes goods to dump. I may as well also take goods to resist him, imitating Russia's five-year plan. I hope that you leaders will work hard on production. ㈡ Wu Xiangru of the Social Affairs Bureau said, "It is not easy for you to be elected this time. This is because you are the people loved by the city's merchants. At this critical moment, the responsibility is very heavy. We now know that a country's wealth is entirely in economic matters. Now all countries are suffering from overproduction, so they are paying close attention to the way out for goods. The place where political power reaches is the place where goods are promoted. I don't know how much our country's annual import surplus is. We have been living with imports not being able to make up for exports year after year. To maintain the lifeline forever, we must develop economic sources. Within a few days, the International Trade Bureau announced that the import surplus has been reduced by 36%. Now it can be divided into several layers to explain. ㈠ is that our people are gradually waking up. ㈡ is that our rural economy is bankrupt and purchasing power is weak. ㈢ is that production has improved, and there are substitutes for various goods. Now this phenomenon is very good. We also hope to change from import surplus to export surplus and bring the money back. This all depends on you with very good plans, research and implementation, common development, from the Shanghai market to the whole of China, so that the current period of panic can be passed safely. This is what I hope you will work hard on.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Public Association: Held a General Meeting of Members Yesterday: Resolved to Submit to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to Stop Collecting Special Construction Donations: Please Ask the Central Government to Extend the Implementation of the Anti-Smoking Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Zhejiang Public Association held a general meeting of members at the Ningbo Native Place Association yesterday at 1:00 pm. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Those who attended the resolutions included Chu Huiseng, Wang Xiaolai</p>
<p>, (Zhu Boyuan's representative) Yu Zhongxian, Cha Renwei, Shen Junru, Yin Zhufu, Zhang Shenzhi, Shen Tianxin, and other more than 50 people. Chu Huiseng and Yin Zhufu served as chairmen. First, Mr. Chu reported on the association's affairs, and then the following were discussed: ㈠ The proposed suggestion to submit to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to stop collecting construction donations first, in order to comply with the central government's decree on reducing and exempting surcharges on land taxes was resolved. (A) Telegraph to the central government for reduction and exemption. (B) Formulate a method and submit it to the Zhejiang Construction Department for exemption. The principle was approved and handed over to the board of directors for handling. ㈡ It is proposed to submit separately to the Executive Yuan and the Zhejiang Provincial Government the proposal to extend the implementation period of the Zhejiang Provincial Provisional Regulations on Clearing Drugs was resolved and approved. ㈢ The case of improving the planting of domestic cigarette leaf varieties to plug leaks and benefit the countryside was resolved and approved. ㈣ The case of submitting to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the National Economic Commission, and writing to Shanghai bankers, that the development of the Northwest should also take into account the Southeast was resolved, the principle was approved, and it was handed over to the board of directors for handling. ㈤ The proposal to suggest that the Zhejiang Provincial Government order all primary schools to participate in the popular education movement was resolved and the principle was approved. ㈥ The suggestion to the Legislative Yuan to add agricultural loans to provide relief was resolved, the principle was approved, and it was handed over to the board of directors for handling. ㈦ Adding standing committees in various counties in order to benefit</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>benefits the homeland and seeks development was resolved and handed over to the board of directors for research. ㈧ Submitting to the Zhejiang Construction Department to abolish the boat license donation case was resolved and the principle was approved. ㈨ In the event of a drought, attention should be paid to disaster relief and civil food was resolved to telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to quickly plan disaster relief measures. After the meeting, it was concluded with Yi Fangshuo's funny remarks.</p>
<p>The Anti-Opium Congress passed a resolution to submit to the Executive Yuan and the Zhejiang Provincial Government to extend the implementation period of the anti-smoking regulations in order to eliminate drugs. The original submission said, (the title is omitted) In Zhejiang Province, although smoking has not been completely eradicated, private planting in Taiwan and Wen has disappeared, and private sale and smoking in various places has also gradually decreased. Commentators attribute this to the Zhejiang Provincial Provisional Regulations on Clearing Drugs. Smokers are afraid of the ban and still know to be somewhat concerned, so they can achieve some results. However, the regulations have been submitted and extended repeatedly. By the end of December this year, the limit will expire again. If the implementation limit expires, the ignorant people will misunderstand that the ban has been relaxed, and smoking will revive again. Jiangsu Province has been handling smoking bans since this year, and the term is set for four years. It is requested that the implementation period of the regulations be extended for another three years, so as to complete the smoking ban in Jiangsu Province at the same time, in order to show the determination to eliminate drugs. For this reason, it is urgently presented. It is hoped that it will be adopted and implemented.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County's Merged Autonomous Regions: Districts Three and Six Combined into One</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County government, acting on orders to reorganize autonomous regions, has completed the process of merging and dividing districts, townships, and towns. This plan has been submitted to the provincial and county authorities and approved. The original six autonomous districts of Shanghai County—District 1 (Minhang), District 2 (Tangwan), District 3 (Beiqiao), District 4 (Sanlin), District 5 (Chenxing), and District 6 (Maqiao)—are now consolidated, with Districts Three and Six merging into a single district. The district public office will remain in Beiqiao, the county seat. The selection of the district head will be made by the county and submitted to the department for appointment. Regarding the specific townships and towns within the merged areas, Yuqi Township and Sangang Township in the Third District, as well as Dingshan Township in the Fourth District, each have fewer than 500 households, but due to their unique circumstances, they will remain independent townships. Towns with few shops will be renamed townships. County Magistrate Pan has instructed all district heads to select candidates for township head and deputy head from the original township officials or previously elected candidates who were not chosen, taking into account the population of each township and designating one head and two deputies. Candidates with strong literacy and capable administrative skills should be prioritized. These candidates should be submitted to the county in double the required number, so that the final selections and merger can be implemented.</p>
<h3>Railway Insiders Discuss the Main Reasons for the Decline of Domestic Coal</h3>
<p>According to reports, coal industry insiders have attributed the decline of domestic coal to high railway freight rates, which have hindered sales and led to a severe downturn. Yesterday, a responsible official from the railway sector discussed the situation in detail, stating that there are numerous reasons for the decline of domestic coal in recent years, and it is not accurate to solely blame high railway freight rates. China's railways are heavily indebted, both domestically and internationally, and freight rates must consider transportation costs. Over the past 20 to 30 years, coal freight rates have increased only slightly, or in some cases, not at all. During the same period, the general price index in China has skyrocketed, increasing by as much as four or five times. Railway operating expenses have increased proportionally with the general price index, while coal freight rates have increased by a maximum of only 40 to 50 percent. Furthermore, railway freight rates for mineral products are more than double those for agricultural products. This phenomenon, in a country that is primarily agricultural rather than industrial, is worthy of further study from a national economic perspective. Mr. Montel, an American consultant previously hired by the Ministry of Railways, strongly advocated raising mineral freight rates and lowering agricultural freight rates in China (because Mr. Montel saw China as an agricultural country similar to the United States, where agricultural freight rates are about half of mineral freight rates, while China's situation is the opposite). However, this matter is related to the entire national economy and requires comprehensive planning and control by the central government to be realized. This is the actual situation of railway freight rates in China. Secondly, the production costs of domestic coal are too high. Coal mines with advantageous positions do not seek to develop external markets and compete with foreign coal. Instead, they transport coal to the inland, squeezing the domestic coal industry. This allows foreign coal to be sold unhindered in major Chinese markets. The coal industry should strive to improve this, and the government should quickly establish measures to restrict it. Therefore, the biggest reason for the decline of domestic coal is that it does not compete with foreign coal and allows foreign coal to be dumped. In addition, the freight rates cited in the statement are often inaccurate. For example, the situation on the Pinghan Railway is not consistent with the facts. The mines along the Pinghan Railway previously had special rates for coal transportation, but these special rates were abolished in 1927 and replaced with the standard rate of 32. Only the Liuhegou Mine, which supplied coal to the railway, was granted a rate of 6.825 cents per ton per kilometer plus 10% under mutually beneficial terms. In 1928, the Jingxing Mine also wanted to supply coal to the Pinghan Railway. After negotiations, it was agreed to charge 70% of the standard rate of 32, based on the principle of mutual benefit. However, on October 10, 1931, when the railway implemented the new special coal freight rate of 32, the previous mutually beneficial rates were canceled, and all mines were charged the same rate according to the new special rate of 32, ensuring equal treatment. Currently, the new special rate of 32 is calculated at 80% or 90%. For the Liuhegou Mine, the current coal freight rate is only slightly less than 10% higher than the previous rate of 6.825 cents per ton per kilometer (which was the lowest rate since the railway opened). Considering the increase in railway operating expenses in recent years, this increase in coal freight is actually minimal.</p>

After Reading the Proposal, We Felt Deeply Alarmed. We Believe That Military Command and Administrative Jurisdiction Are Fundamentally Different. The Former Emphasizes Unified Authority, While the Latter Should Aim for Long-Term Stability. Now that Chairman Chiang has been Appointed by the Central Government to Suppress the Communist Bandits and Complete the Great Task of Unification, All National Armed Forces and Local Guards Are Under His Command and Dispatch. All Facilities That Facilitate Military Progress, Such as the Construction of Roads, Fortifications, the Implementation of the Baojia System, and Other Important Policies, Are Implemented Consistently Upon His Brief Instruction, Without Being Hindered by Provincial Boundaries. If Officers and Soldiers Are Ordered to Fight Fiercely, Dividing Responsibilities and Assigning Tasks, the Military Border Areas Would Have Already Been Planned, Coexisting with Administrative Regions, Which Is a Very Obvious Fact. Wuyuan Is Adjacent to Zhejiang and Jiangxi, and the Bandits Who Disturb Us Are Mostly Small Groups Who Have Fled from Jiangxi. Although They Briefly Attacked the City in the Winter of 1931, They Withdrew Soon After Without Attempting to Occupy It. We Have Strengthened Our Defenses in Recent Years to Prevent Their Spread. If the Root Cause Can Be Eliminated, There Will Be No Further Local Concerns. It Is Evident That to Thoroughly Eradicate the Bandits, It Is Not Necessary to Focus on Wuyuan. We Dare Not Presume to Speculate on the Military Advantages of Transferring Wuyuan to the Jurisdiction of Jiangxi. Changing Administrative Regions Involves Matters of Great Importance, and We Feel That It Is Actually Extremely Difficult. After Careful Consideration, We Believe It Is Impossible. Therefore, We Dare to Lay Bare Our Hearts and Present Our Petition to the Council, Beseeching You to Consider It. (Omitted). The Above Are All Long-Term Considerations Based on Past Events and Future Concerns. We Have Compiled This Document Stating All the Difficulties Involved in Transferring Wuyuan to the Jurisdiction of Jiangxi. We Hope That the Council Will Review and Approve It and Request the Executive Yuan to Revoke the Transfer in Order to Comply with Public Sentiment and Console the People. The Local Area Will Be Greatly Fortunate. Respectfully Submitted to the Members of the Political Council of the Central Executive Committee, Wuyuan Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai.</p>

Then, the memorial oration was read: "On this first day of July, the Year of Jiaxu, the 23rd year of the Republic of China, we, the members of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai South District Fire Brigade Alliance, Wang Zhen, Mao Jingchou, Mu Shuzai, He Yongshou (Head of the East District), Zhu Liangcai (Director of the South District), Xia Guoliang (Director of the West District), Lu Hongyi (Director of the North District), and all members, respectfully offer clear wine and delicious food to the spirits of the past leaders of this association. Preventing disasters and protecting our community is our common goal. Honoring virtue and rewarding merit has always been an important tradition. May our efforts benefit society, and may their spirits never be forgotten. Since the founding of our association, many years have passed, and we mourn the loss of countless predecessors. Their achievements remain. Some sacrificed themselves in the line of duty, some dedicated their lives to public service through tireless work, some pioneered and planned with great effort, and some generously contributed financial support. They were beneficial to people in life and worthy of worship in death. We, the members of this association, feel deeply moved. As the Dragon Boat Festival has passed and the time for the Dragon Boat Races approaches, we look to the islands of the immortals, hoping to see the day when they return on cranes. In the past, we worked together like family. Today, their voices and faces seem to be still with us. We express our sincere condolences and hold this memorial service to show our eternal respect. We offer simple sacrifices with utmost sincerity, hoping to invoke their blessings and protection."</p>
<p>Annual General Meeting: After the public memorial service, a luncheon was held at noon.

The weather was extremely hot.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Urgently Establishes Epidemic Hospital; Health Bureau Issues Epidemic Prevention Guidelines</h3>
<p>The recent hot and dry weather has made it difficult to avoid epidemics. Epidemic hospitals established by various sectors in the city, such as the branches on Xizang Road and Haining Road, were established yesterday to provide relief. Especially concerning is the large number of poor people in Zhabei. Wang Binyan, Director of the Zhabei Charity Group, and Gong Xikui, Director of the Fourth District Office, are very concerned and actively organizing an epidemic hospital, which will soon be established. A prayer meeting will also be held at the Liuying Road Charity Group to pray for rain. The city's Health Bureau has also manufactured a large number of vaccines to supply. In recent days, more than 20,000 citizens have been vaccinated. According to the Health Bureau, the following are the key points for epidemic prevention: (1) People of all ages, genders, and backgrounds should get vaccinated, as vaccinations create antibodies that can neutralize pathogens. While vaccination does not guarantee immunity, it can reduce the severity of the illness and make it easier to treat. The bureau is currently dispatching personnel to provide free vaccinations. (2) Avoid consuming raw water and anything that has been washed, rinsed, or made with raw water, as raw water often contains pathogens that cannot be seen with the naked eye. If these pathogens enter the intestines, they can cause serious infectious diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever. Strict precautions should be taken to prevent raw water from entering the mouth. (3) Flies are carriers of cholera and typhoid fever. Epidemics are prone to spread during the summer and autumn due to the proliferation of flies and the tendency to consume raw and cold foods, increasing the chance of ingesting pathogens. (4) It is hoped that citizens will eliminate flies. (5) Disinfect dirty places and latrines with lysol or lime water to reduce the breeding of bacteria and eliminate foul odors. The above points are simple and require everyone's effort to prevent epidemics. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<h3>Hongkou Epidemic Hospital Opens</h3>
<p>The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital, located at 451 Tangshan Road, was established by the Jiyi Charity Association. Its long-standing work has greatly benefited the common people, and it is well-known in the eastern part of Shanghai. This year, Dou Yaoting, Zhu Shien, and Zhu Meixian were elected as directors, Li Quancai as the economic director, Bao Lianning and Xu Zaigao as the general affairs directors, and Lin Chunshan and Zhu Xiaofang as the medical directors. Experienced doctors such as Lin Xiongfei, Zhang Zidao, and Shi Yongqi have been hired to take charge day and night. It is reported that the hospital opened today (July 1st), and more than 300 patients have already arrived. Given the recent hot weather and the crowded living conditions of many Hongkou residents, it is easier for epidemics to break out. The opening of the hospital is indeed urgently needed.</p>

<h3>Local Area Scorched Again Yesterday; Strong Winds in the Evening, Brief Intimation of Rain, But Alas, the Wind Blew the Clouds Away</h3>
<p>The weather in Shanghai has been extremely hot for several days, with average temperatures around 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Yesterday was particularly muggy. The sun blazed high in the sky, and there was no wind. Even those who stayed indoors were drenched in sweat. The Fahrenheit thermometer rose to 102.7 degrees, which is rare for the plum rain season. The rivers and waterways in the nearby countryside have dried up due to excessive evaporation. Farmers are facing difficulties in irrigation, a disastrous sign that threatens food security. Epidemics are rampant, and the hospitals are overcrowded. In the evening, the heat became even more oppressive. Around 9:00 PM, lightning flashed in the sky, followed by strong winds, carrying sand and dust. There was a sense of imminent rain. The heat disappeared, bringing a welcome coolness. However, after about 20 minutes, the wind died down and the clouds dispersed. While the temperature dropped slightly, there was still no rain. Farmers are understandably worried.</p>
<h3>Fire at Dada Warehouse; Cause of Fire Still Under Investigation; Total Losses Estimated at Over 100,000</h3>
<p>The Dada Company, located at 16th Pier in the South City, is managed by Yang Guanyi. Recently, its ships have been subjected to piracy, fire, and other disasters, leading to poor business and annual losses. Unexpectedly, at 5:05 AM yesterday, just as dawn was breaking, a fire broke out in the company's Warehouse No. 1, causing losses estimated at over 100,000 yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Warehouse Situation</h3>
<p>The warehouse is located next to the warehouse of the Ningshao Company on the Bund of 16th Pier in the South City, facing the Huangpu River. It occupies several acres. The warehouse has two floors and is divided into sixteen large rooms, capable of storing over 10,000 items of cargo. The warehouse is constructed with steel, reinforced concrete, and blue and red bricks, costing over 10,000 yuan. However, it has been in use for over a decade, so everything inside is old. The warehouse's daily operations are managed by accountants Gao Longxiang and Dai Dianlun, appointed by the company, with the assistance of four warehouse staff. The warehouse opens at 6:00 AM every day for merchants to deposit and withdraw goods, and closes at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Fire Breaks Out at Dawn</h3>
<p>At 5:05 AM yesterday, just as dawn was breaking, a fire broke out in Warehouse No. 1. Thick smoke filled the air, and flames soared. Nearby police officers noticed the fire and immediately reported it to the First District Headquarters, which relayed the information to the Fire Brigade Alliance. The fire alarm was immediately sounded, and fire trucks from various districts rushed to the scene to connect to water and begin extinguishing the fire. The doors and windows were pried open with iron tools to allow the hoses to be brought inside and water to be sprayed on the flames.</p>
<h3>Extinguishing the Fire</h3>
<p>Fire brigades from the Central District and the French Concession also arrived to assist in extinguishing the fire. Firefighters climbed onto the roof of the warehouse and pried open the iron roof to pour water inside. By this time, most of the goods inside the warehouse had already caught fire. However, because the warehouse doors were tightly closed, the fire did not spread widely. When the roof was pried open, the fire intensified due to the increased airflow. The flames shot upwards, illuminating the sky and reflecting in the Huangpu River. After the relentless efforts of Chinese and Western firefighters, the fire was finally extinguished at 7:45 AM. However, Warehouse No. 1 had been completely destroyed.</p>
<h3>Total Damage</h3>
<p>When the fire broke out, District Chief Guan of the First District rushed to the scene with Police Inspector Guo Jifen, Police Chief Pang Zilin, and a large number of police officers to maintain order. After the fire was extinguished, it was determined that the warehouse contained approximately 200 pieces of coarse cloth and 700 pieces of fine yarn from the Nantong Dasheng Textile Mill, as well as over 4,000 pieces of grain, such as soybeans and peanuts, stored by Guangyuanxiangfeng and other companies. Two-thirds of the goods were destroyed by the fire, and the remaining one-third was damaged by water. The estimated losses, including the cargo and the warehouse itself, amounted to over 100,000 yuan. Fortunately, the goods were insured for a significant amount.</p>
<h3>Cause Unknown</h3>
<p>The cause of the fire is unknown. The warehouse accountant, Gao Longxiang, was taken to the First District Headquarters for questioning by District Chief Guan. Gao Longxiang stated that the fire broke out at 5:05 AM, before the warehouse doors were opened, and that he did not know where the fire came from. He was detained pending further investigation of the cause of the fire. The company's general manager, Yang Guanyi, was also detained and handed over to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Wu Xing-sheng and Mei-sheng Case: Two Sisters-in-Law in Litigation - Husband's Death Leads to Ice and Coal - Unsuccessful Mediation Leads to Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Wu Xu-shi, a 37-year-old woman from Wuxi, currently residing at No. 25, Pope Village, Pope Road, French Concession, married Wu Xing-sheng from the same village in her early years. She and her brother-in-law Mei-sheng and his wife had been living together in a jointly built residence at No. 96, Houfu Lane, Xinzha Road, and they had always been harmonious. Unexpectedly, in the ninth year of the Republic of China, Xing-sheng passed away due to illness, and Wu Xu-shi became a widow. Because her brother-in-law treated her well, she was still able to live peacefully. Who knew that the previous year, Mei-sheng also died of illness, and since his death, his wife, Wu Bao-shi, had become domineering and treated her with discrimination, regarding her as a thorn in her side. Recently, she secretly applied to the First Special District Court for a certificate of inheritance for the estate jointly owned by her husband and brother-in-law, intending to seize the property. Wu Xu-shi then hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Peng Yuanxun to file a lawsuit against Wu Bao-shi in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court. The complaint stated that her husband, Wu Xing-sheng, and her brother-in-law, Mei-sheng, were brothers. Their ancestors also had two branches of the family. Her father-in-law, Yu-chang, was the eldest, and her uncle-in-law, Fu-tang, was the second. The uncle had no children, so he adopted her brother-in-law, Mei-sheng, as his heir. Since her grandfather-in-law, Han-qing, the estate had never been divided. The ancestral property had always been managed by her uncle-in-law, Fu-tang, who made a fortune through business operations. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, her husband fell ill, and in the twenty-first year, her brother-in-law, Mei-sheng, passed away. All the family wealth then fell into the defendant's hands. As Wu's wife for over twenty years, she had lived together in harmony until now. However, since her brother-in-law's death, the defendant had become discriminatory and now seeks to seize the property, disregarding the rights of the eldest son's family. She had no choice but to request mediation, but the defendant remained stubborn and refused to change, so no agreement could be reached. Therefore, she requested the court to investigate the case and order the defendant to divide the ancestral property in her possession, giving one-half to the eldest son's family to be managed by the plaintiff. Furthermore, as she was lonely and penniless, she lacked the funds to pay the litigation fees and requested litigation assistance with a guarantee from the Asia East Library. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong took the bench in the seventh courtroom to hear the case. The defendant did not appear. The plaintiff's testimony was as before, stating that her uncle gave her forty to fifty yuan per month for household expenses, treating her very well. Now, because her brother-in-law's wife was abusive and seizing property, she filed a lawsuit to request division of the estate, estimated at over two million, including shares in the Ruikang Paint Shop on Wangping Street. Judge Shen verified the testimony and stated that the plaintiff's request for litigation assistance required an investigation of her guarantee and the summoning of Wu's relatives Wu Tongwen and Xi Exian to testify in court. He then adjourned the case to July 12th in the morning for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Two Apprentices Fight, One Beaten to Death - Dead Before Reaching the Hospital</h3>
<p>Ling Hai-xun, 21 years old, from Pudong, and Gu Bao-ping, 18 years old, from Pudong, were both apprentices at Lu Hongchang Tailor Shop at No. 298, Tongfu Road. Last night around 9:00 PM, Ling and Gu were cleaning up the shop and saw many scraps of wool fabric on the floor. They started throwing the scraps at each other playfully, but soon a disagreement arose, and neither would give way, even resorting to violence. Ling Hai-xun punched Gu Bao-ping hard in the back of his left head, hitting a vital spot. Gu Bao-ping immediately fell to the ground, unconscious. Fortunately, their fellow apprentices saw it and quickly helped him up.</p>
<p>He was barely breathing. They immediately reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station, who sent a detective to arrest Ling. They rushed Gu Bao-ping to the hospital by car for treatment, but he died en route. The body was sent to the coroner's office, and the court was notified this morning for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Shanghai to Have Large-Scale Seafood Company - Organized by Zhou Wangyue and Others in the Fishing Industry - Submitted to the Ministry for Record-Keeping, Expected to be Established in Autumn</h3>
<p>Zhou Wangyue, a prominent figure in the Shanghai fishing industry, recognizing the decline of China's fisheries and the annual import of seafood reaching as high as forty million yuan, and in order to develop the fishing industry and recover profits, has joined with over ten important figures in the city's fishing business, including Huang Zhenshe, Jin Chuxiang, Wang Zengxiang, Liu Tonghua, and Dai Jufang, to launch a large-scale seafood company. The project is now actively underway and will soon be formally established. The Daily News reporter has learned the organizational details of the company and its planned improvements to the fishing industry, which are detailed below.</p>
<h3>Company Organization</h3>
<p>The company will be named National Seafood Co., Ltd., with a capital of 500,000 yuan. It has already secured the support of a majority of the city's fishing industry and has been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for record-keeping. The Ministry reviewed it and found its purpose to be the same as the salt fish processing plant planned in the Ministry's four-year fisheries plan and has issued approval, allowing promotion. A preparatory office has been established at No. 6, Hengxin Lane, Limalu, 16th Wharf, South City, to begin operations and is expected to be formally established and begin business in the fall of this year.</p>
<h3>Scope of Business</h3>
<p>The company's scope of business includes: 1) Establishing seafood processing plants in four important fishing areas along the coasts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang: Shengshan, Sijiao, Daishan, and Zhoushan, to facilitate cooperation between fishermen; 2) Providing its own gasoline transport ships to collect fishermen's catches and transport fresh goods; 3) Affiliating a natural ice plant and warehouse; 4) Organizing fishermen's cooperatives. In the future, it will also purchase fishing vessels for self-fishing and shellfish farming to increase production, subject to business development. The estimated annual business volume is expected to reach over ten million yuan.</p>
<h3>Fishing Ground Survey</h3>
<p>In order to develop this enterprise, founder Zhou Wangyue first needed to understand the fish production situation. He made a special trip to the coastal fishing areas and conducted a long-term survey, passing through Xiangshan, Zhenhai, Taizhou, Wenzhou, Shengshan, Sijiao, Daishan, and other places. According to statistics, the annual yield is about 1.6 million dan of yellow croaker, over 570,000 dan of large yellow croaker, about 300,000 dan of cuttlefish, over 500,000 dan of ribbonfish, and about 200,000 dan of jellyfish skin. There are also detailed statistics on other items such as river fish, rice fish, pomfret, le fish, freshwater products and seaweed.</p>
<h3>Improvement Plan</h3>
<p>As for the company's plans for improving the fishing industry after its establishment, in order to make it easy and adapt to the needs, the decision was made to start with the establishment of seafood processing plants. Specialists have been hired to conduct research, and each plant will have separate sections for salted fish, dried fish, and canned fish, all processed using scientific methods to make them long-lasting and appropriately seasoned. An agency for fishermen's affairs will also be attached to provide fishermen with various needs, so that fishermen can reduce their burden and focus on fishing, to achieve the practical effect of promoting seafood and assisting rural areas.</p>
<h3>Descendants of Jiang the Mule Driver in Inheritance Dispute - Jiang the Mule Driver's Sinking of Gold During the Red Scourge Made Him Rich - Nearly a Century Later, Nanjing Residents Still Talk About It</h3>
<p>Jiang Jingfen, a Nanjing woman residing at No. 23, Sanderfang, Connaught Road, is 35 years old. After losing her mother at the age of seven, her father, Jiang Xingjie, took Yang as a concubine. Jingfen was then raised by the concubine. Later, Yang bore three more children, and Xingjie promoted her to manage the household. Last December 7th, Xingjie passed away, and all his property was in Yang's hands. Jingfen repeatedly demanded a share but was not allowed. She has now hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-lawsuit with the First Special District Court on charges of embezzlement of inheritance. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng opened the court for a hearing. After the plaintiff's lawyer stated the case, Judge Huang stated that if the defendant, Jiang Yang, had indeed been formally changed from a concubine to a stepmother by Jiang Xingjie, then she would naturally be a direct senior relative of the plaintiff, and according to the law, a self-lawsuit could not be filed. He immediately ordered the plaintiff to present evidence to resolve the issue of the defendant's identity before proceeding further. However, the defendant's defense lawyer, Jiang Yiping, also raised the issue of the plaintiff's identity, stating that although the plaintiff was Jiang Xingjie's biological daughter, she had been adopted as the daughter of Xingjie's eldest brother when she was young. Her relationship with the defendant was that of aunt and niece. How could a niece interfere with the management of an uncle's estate by the aunt? Moreover, the defendant had children, so the inheritance was not for the plaintiff to touch and she had no right to file a lawsuit. He requested that the lawsuit be rejected. Judge Huang then adjourned the case to wait for proof of identity before proceeding with the trial. As for the huge amount of property left by Jiang Xingjie, although it was inherited from his grandfather, the rise of his grandfather and father was a matter of chance. At that time, it was the time of the Red Scourge. Jiang's ancestor was captured by the Taiping Army and forced to serve as a mule driver. Wherever the army passed, the plundered property was carried by mules. One day, taking advantage of the distance from the escorting soldiers, while passing by a river, Jiang's ancestor unloaded the gold and silver from the mule's back and threw it into the deep pool, abandoning the mule and fleeing, but silently remembering the location of the submerged treasure. After the rebellion subsided, Jiang's ancestor went to the original location and managed to retrieve the submerged property, becoming a wealthy man. Jiang the Mule Driver became famous from then on. Although it has been nearly a century, those in the Stone City who know the inside story of the Jiang family still talk about it with relish.</p>
<h3>Zhiwen's Flight is Not Without Cause - Part of Jing'an Temple Sealed - Debt Dispute Problem Completely Proven to be True; Zhiwen's Absence When Sealed Seemingly Confirms Flight</h3>
<p>The flight of Abbot Zhiwen of Jing'an Temple due to debt disputes was confirmed by the Datong News Agency reporter who visited Jing'an Temple in detail at 8:00 AM yesterday. Zhiwen's residence has been sealed by the First Special District Court of Jiangsu and Shanghai. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Debt Dispute Proves Fact</h3>
<p>When the Datong News Agency reporter went to the temple yesterday morning to inquire about the truth, the monks and laymen of the temple initially refused to comment. After the reporter's explanation, Liu Jinrong (from Zhenjiang), the temple's accountant, agreed to meet. According to Liu, the claim that Zhiwen absconded with funds was not true (this newspaper's article yesterday did not make a definite conclusion on this). However, the debt dispute was true, and he said that the dispute was entirely Zhiwen's personal matter and had nothing to do with the Jing'an Temple, which is a public monastery.</p>
<h3>Zhiwen's Residence Sealed</h3>
<p>Liu continued to say that the reason for the rumors of Zhiwen's flight was due to the First Special District Court of Jiangsu and Shanghai sealing Zhiwen's bedroom on the afternoon of the 26th of last month. Liu said that after the court sealed the room, the reporter asked to see the sealed bedroom. Liu agreed and led him through the cloister behind the storeroom. The end of the corridor was the front and rear abbot's rooms that were connected to the pilgrims. Zhiwen's bedroom was located to the right of the rear abbot's room. A piece of white bamboo cloth was hung on the door, its size just enough to cover the door, like a door curtain. The reporter lifted the cloth and saw that the court's seal was crossed on the door, with the words "Attachment of Movable Property of Zhiwen by the First Special District Court of Jiangsu and Shanghai." Seeing this, the reporter believed that the debt claim had been proven true. He then returned to the storeroom with Liu to discuss everything.</p>
<h3>Flight Rumors Originate From This</h3>
<p>Liu continued that when the court bailiff Zhu and two police officers, along with creditor Ge Heqing, came to the temple to seal the room on the afternoon of the 26th, Zhiwen was out. They wanted to seal the main gate, but Liu argued that the seal stated that it was only to attach Zhiwen's movable property and did not involve the temple itself. As a result, only Zhiwen's bedroom and all the equipment in the room were sealed. However, due to Zhiwen's absence during the sealing, rumors of flight arose.</p>
<h3>Zhiwen Talks About Debt Outline</h3>
<p>Afterwards, based on Liu's account, the Datong News Agency reporter went to Chen Zemin Lawyer's office at No. 5, Zhenjili, Chengdu Road,</p>
<p>personally met with the monk Zhiwen. This provided strong evidence that he had not fled. However, according to Zhiwen, the debt dispute was an old case from 1933. The creditor, Ge Heqing, currently lives at No. 2, Zhentuli, Katz Avenue. As for the details of the dispute, he was unwilling to disclose them, only saying that he had asked Chen Zemin Lawyer to write a statement requesting the court to unseal the room.</p>

After performing the formalities, the following resolutions were passed: 1) Request the Ministry of Industry to provide relief to fishing villages and implement fish plants at production sites; 2) Secret. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Largest Underworld Bell in the Far East - 30,000 Kilograms - Initiated by Buddhist Groups - To be Installed on the Highest Peak of Jiuhua Mountain - Cost 48,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Five groups, including the Shanghai Buddhist Pure Vegetarian Society, the Buddhist Bookstore, the Chinese Buddhist Association, the Jiuhua Buddhist Association, and the World Buddhist Layman's Association, have initiated the installation of a large bell on the highest peak of Jiuhua Mountain in Lihui (about thirty miles from the ground). The bell's weight has been pre-determined to be 30,000 kilograms and will soon be put out for tender. If it is cast, it will be the largest bell in the Far East. The reason these five groups are casting the bell is that Jiuhua Mountain is traditionally believed to be the place where "Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha" attained enlightenment. It is said that Ksitigarbha Buddha's great vow is to liberate the souls in the hell realm. If the bell is installed on Jiuhua Mountain, the sound of its striking will be heard hundreds of miles away, allowing the souls to be alerted. Therefore, according to the initiator Li Jingwei yesterday afternoon, the bell will be named the "Underworld Bell." Li continued that he is currently drafting the articles of association and has stipulated the cost of casting the bell to be 48,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>TCM Doctor Shen Zhongfang Case - Court Hears Medical Principles Debate - Plaintiff Dissatisfied with the Shenzhou Medical Association Advertisement - Debate Concludes Yesterday, Verdict Announced on the 7th</h3>
<p>Shen Zhongfang, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) doctor from Wujin specializing in measles and pediatrics, was recently sued by Xia Meiting, who hired lawyers Huang Xiubo and Xuan Zhendong, under Article 291 of the Criminal Law for negligence causing death. The First Special District Court's hearing of the case has been detailed in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan opened the Second Criminal Court to hear the case. Shen also attended with lawyers Tao Jiachun and Zhang Zhirang. Both parties submitted statements on their research on medicine. First, witness Jiang Wenfang testified that on the 6th of last month, he represented the Shanghai Municipal Association of Chinese Medicine at a meeting of representatives from medical groups across the city convened by the Shenzhou National Medical Association. At that time, the Shenzhou Association explained the case in detail and requested public judgment on whether the Shen Zhongfang's medical plan previously assessed by the association was biased. He reviewed Shen's medical plan in detail and determined that according to the pulse record, Shen's medicine was all ordinary medicine and was not enough to kill. Therefore, he did not express any objection. Next, Dr. Zhu Xingjiang testified that he was invited by the plaintiff to diagnose Sun Luan's smallpox on April 9th and 10th, but it was already at a critical point. He diagnosed the main reason as being due to heat and exhaustion of essence. The court then asked how he felt about Shen Zhongfang's plan based on personal experience. Zhu initially did not answer, but then said that it was relatively peaceful and harmless. Then, Xia Meiting stated that smallpox has two types, deficiency and excess. For deficiency, hot medicine should be used, and for excess, cold medicine should be used. Death caused by hot medicine can be seen immediately, but death caused by cold medicine cannot be detected by the patient. The doctor who uses hot medicine and causes death is excusable because hot medicine is used to save lives in an emergency, and the intention is to save people. Now, his grandson's condition was clearly a deficiency syndrome, but Shen Zhongfang repeatedly used cold medicine, causing diarrhea to be incessant, essence to be exhausted, and poison to sink. The defendant did not use Shengma Gegen Tang to raise yang and promote outward release, so that the spirit could be strong and the epidemic toxin could be released. He cited various ancient medical books to prove Shen's mistakes. Shen refuted each point of the plaintiff's attack, saying that the reason for not using Shengma Gegen Tang was that Luan's heat was already unbearable, and if he were to raise it further, it would turn into panic seizures, and who could bear this responsibility? Lawyer Xuan said that the assessment by the Shenzhou Medical Association did not answer the plan in detail and was completely vague. The plaintiff was not satisfied and requested that the original plan be sent to medical groups in other cities for re-assessment. The court ruled that there was no need for further assessment and ordered the start of the debate. The plaintiff's lawyers Huang and Xuan argued that the defendant, Shen Zhongfang, was a supervisor of the Shenzhou Medical Association. At that time, the plaintiff requested an academic explanation from the association, not an assessment. However, the association published a large advertisement in newspapers asking for public judgment. The Shenzhou Medical Association was asked by the court to assess whether Shen Zhongfang's plan was wrong. The association did not accept the case for trial, but only needed to make an assessment. There was no need to spend a huge amount of money to publish advertisements asking for public judgment. Furthermore, the advertisement included a letter from Dr. Zhu Xingjiang, in which two extremely important words were replaced, one with "other" and one with a square box. The meaning of the content is obvious. They also criticized the defendant's prescriptions and medication one by one. Then, lawyers Tao and Zhang made a powerful defense for Shen Zhongfang based on academic principles. The court then adjourned the debate and set July 7th to announce the verdict.</p>

In addition, the hotel sent a special representative to the United States on June 3rd to find a band and dance stars. They have now received a call that they will arrive in Shanghai together at the end of August.</p>
<h3>University Student Jumps into the River from the Jiangtian Wheel from Shanghai to Ningbo - Suicide Note Signed "Wandering Soul" - Bitterly Describes the Cruelty of Society</h3>
<p>The Jiangtian Wheel from Shanghai to Ningbo, when it arrived at Wusong at 5:15 PM the day before yesterday, a young passenger suddenly jumped into the river.

<p>Zheng Shang, a native of Wenling County (age 31), a graduate of the 4th class of the Whampoa Military Academy and currently serving as a staff officer in the National Revolutionary Army's 1st Division, recently committed a major crime in Zhejiang Province. When he fled back to his hometown, the provincial government secretly ordered the Wenling County Public Security Bureau to detain him nearby. However, Zheng had already heard the news and boarded a Zhoushan steamer, fleeing to Shanghai, causing the bureau to be unable to arrest him. Anticipating that the steamer would arrive in Shanghai yesterday, they immediately telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Police Department for assistance in the arrest. After receiving the telegram, Bureau Chief Wen Hong'en secretly ordered Inspector Xiao Changhe to request Water Patrol Captain Zhu Haishan to dispatch detectives Zhang Fusheng, Zhu Yangxian, inspectors Zhu Songquan, and Sergeant Yang Bingkui, etc., around 12 o'clock late at night the day before, on a patrol boat to secretly guard near the No. 9 wharf on the 16th Bund in Nanshi. It wasn't until around 3 o'clock yesterday morning that the Zhoushan steamer slowly arrived at the port. The officers immediately jumped onto the steamer without waiting for it to dock and conducted a search, finally arresting Zheng Shang in the second cabin of the steamer. He was taken to the team and reported to the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, which transferred him to officials from the Wenling County Public Security Bureau, who escorted him back to the provincial government for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>China Accounting School's Bank Bookkeeping Course Opens Early The China Accounting Correspondence School at No. 275 Gordon Road, Shanghai, was founded by accountant Shen Liren. Over the years, it has cultivated no less than 2,000 accounting talents, with outstanding achievements and a reputation in society. The school's correspondence regulations originally included a course on bank bookkeeping, but because this subject is a characteristic of accounting, it was listed as an elective course. The regulations stipulated that it must be taken only after completing the entire course, so it has not yet been offered. Now, the school, in view of the increasingly developed domestic financial industry and the prosperity of banks, recognizes that there is a great shortage of bank bookkeeping personnel. In order to actively cultivate specialized personnel in this field to meet the urgent needs of the banking industry, it has slightly revised the regulations. The bank bookkeeping course in the elective course will be opened early on August 1st of this year, so that those who aspire to work in the banking industry can acquire the skills to work in the banking industry as soon as possible. The tuition fee for this course was originally set at ten yuan. It is now heard that the lecture notes have been greatly increased, and the printing and other expenses are quite large. The tuition fee has been changed to fifteen yuan, but those who register in advance before the start of the course will still be charged ten yuan according to the old regulations, to encourage progress. Late registrations will be handled according to the new regulations.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: I have read the news column of your newspaper on June 28th of this year, which published a section on salt farmers being exploited by salt merchants. According to the Central News Agency, someone from Qidong County, across the river from Chongming, said that the suffering of salt farmers has reached the extreme, and the exploitation by salt merchants is almost unbearable. It is said that Qidong produces the most salt, but the salt farmers lack salt to eat, so there are occasional cases of theft and robbery. It is hoped that those in charge of salt administration will find ways to improve the situation. After carefully reading this news, I found that it is completely inconsistent with the facts. It is true that Qidong produces salt, which is produced by boiling. The annual harvest is only about 2,000 to 3,000 dan to 3,000 to 4,000 dan. Due to tax revenue considerations, the government requires that boiling be abolished and sun-drying be adopted. Last year, Qidong was ordered to stop boiling salt altogether, and the government provided subsidies to the salt households to encourage them to close their businesses. The facts are there, and there is no room for denial. Under the current circumstances, since the abolition of boiling in Qidong, there are actually no so-called salt farmers. Recently, there has been a small group of former salt households who are still scraping brine and secretly boiling salt, arbitrarily smuggling it. However, selling smuggled salt is clearly illegal, and the tax police have had to pay close attention to blocking and seizing it in recent days to avoid smuggling, as public salt taxes are at stake. This is the truth of the matter, and it has absolutely no connection with salt merchants. How could there be exploitation? Although your newspaper adopts the principle of recording everything heard, you should also examine the accuracy of the news to reveal the public truth. Therefore, I am sending this letter specifically to request that you make corrections quickly to avoid confusing the public. I would be most grateful. To the Shenbao Newspaper Office, the Salt Merchants Association of the Five Prefectures of Western Zhejiang and Southern Jiangsu, July 23, 1934.</p>

<h3>Reading Q&amp;A: Mei Lanfang and the Future of Chinese Old Opera (3)</h3>
<p>(Answering Mr. Li Ruhui)</p>
<p>Secondly, is Chinese old opera symbolic? Is symbolism popular in the Soviet Union now? Obviously, this is a deliberate rumor! We can say that Chinese old opera does not contain any symbolic elements. Symbolism uses concrete signs of the senses to express a kind of mysterious, emotional inclination and style, but the material of Chinese old opera is mostly historical legends, and its arguments are mostly the old clichés of "promoting good and punishing evil." There is no mysterious emotion in this, so there is no need to use concrete signs of the senses to symbolize anything. Can we see a play in old opera that is expressed unclearly and difficult to understand? To express a loyal minister, there is only that set of loyal minister plots, and to express a treacherous thief, there is only that set of treacherous thief plots. Everything is stereotyped and fixed. In terms of artistic value, this simple method of expression is low-level and has a very large distance from the symbolism produced under the Western capitalist system. Even those facial makeups that are generally considered to contain the most symbolism (the three-flower face is used to express treacherous ministers, such as Cao Cao and Yan Song; the red face is used to express loyalty and bravery, such as Guan Yu and Zhao Kuangyin) and the use of a horse whip to represent a horse can only be said to help the audience understand the plot (on the one hand, it also shows the simplicity of the performing arts), but</p>
<p>cannot be considered symbolism. So-called symbolism does not refer to form, but mainly to content. As for the Soviet Union, as Mr. Li said, isn't it precisely describing all aspects of socialist construction with a clear brush? The Soviet theatrical world already belongs to the masses themselves. They do not need symbolism, and they will not push culture back to the old path of capitalist culture. Symbolism is a manifestation of morbid psychology, and when the Soviet masses are healthy and enthusiastically working on construction, how can they embark on the path of symbolism? Those who say that socialist realism has gradually declined in the Soviet Union and that symbolism is becoming popular are clearly "borrowing a corpse to resurrect the soul," using this to promote Chinese old opera. They see Xu Beihong holding an exhibition in Paris and think that Chinese painting has gained a foothold in the world. They see a few monks appearing in the West and think that Eastern spiritual civilization has triumphed over Western material civilization. Similarly, they see the Soviet Union inviting Mei Lanfang to perform and think that Chinese old opera is about to flourish on the world stage. This is a complete attempt to restore the old. Furthermore, it is a distortion of the current situation in the Soviet Union, just as many famous scholars in the world believe that the Soviet Union has a tendency to return to the capitalist path. They use this to deny the success of Soviet cultural construction, thinking that Soviet socialist realism has failed and is about to return to the embrace of symbolism! Unfortunately, in fact, socialist realism in Soviet literature and drama is developing forward along with the entire cultural construction, even if Mr. Shi Heng says, "In the unlikely event that the Soviet Union, like the United States, gives Mei Lanfang a double degree..." can only be regarded as Mr. Shi Heng's clever speculation.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union's invitation to Mei Lanfang is not, as Mr. Shi Heng said, because they have spare money, because of "curiosity," but has another meaning. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union is trying to accept the world's literary heritage, and the Soviet theater is welcoming classical plays such as Shakespeare. This situation is in stark contrast to Hitler's burning of books in Germany, showing that the Soviet Union's concern for world culture is only to critically accept the old culture in order to create a new culture. Conversely, only the builders of new culture can absorb all the essence of the old culture. Although Chinese old opera is already dead, it has become a skeleton in the tomb, but it has after all had a long history and has confused the general public in China. Its value of existence should not be easily denied. Therefore, the Soviet Union's invitation to Mei Lanfang is not to see the male actor Mei Lang dressed as a woman, but has the same meaning as playing classical plays such as Shakespeare (of course, the artistic value of Chinese old opera is several million miles away from the artistic value of classical plays such as Shakespeare). They attempt to be able to pick out some small fragments of gold in this vast desert.</p>
<p>Therefore, our conclusion is: Mei Lanfang's trip to Russia to perform will neither revive the endangered old opera nor "lose" the face of anyone in China. To think that the three northeastern provinces were lost at the hands of Hu Die and to think that Xu Beihong is promoting Chinese culture in Paris are equally ridiculous and boring, and intentionally distort the facts. The lack of artistry in Chinese old opera and its loss of the basis for existence, leading to its decline, is an irreversible matter. This is not just a matter of some gongs and drums, facial makeups, and men dressed as women, but a matter of the essence of drama. Chinese old opera is far removed from the real life of the masses today. Plays such as Fengbo Pavilion and Zou Maicheng no longer arouse the sympathy of the masses. The masses need a reflection of their current, living life. On the stage, they no longer want to see the filial behavior of loyal figures such as Guan Yu and Yue Fei, but want to see the emergence of new heroic postures. Mr. Jizi's suggestion that Mei Lanfang teach some female disciples to pass on his mantle and consolidate the foundation of old opera is a fantasy that arises from only seeing the formal side.</p>
<p>Similarly, in order to resolutely oppose old opera, we must immediately create new and emerging dramas to replace it and become the art that the masses appreciate. We ask for the reasons why the new and emerging dramas of the past few years have failed to gain the widespread support of the masses. On the other hand, we must absorb the elements that can be absorbed from the old opera. We have not yet reached the point where we can fully accept the legacy like the Soviet Union, but the use of old forms (such as the organization of mobile troupes and the use of drums and bugles or large gongs and drums to excite the masses) is not to be erased when new forms have not grown. We must pay attention to the influence of old opera on the masses! (The End)</p>

Now, as a result of implementing austerity measures, the actual shortfall at the end of the year is estimated to be approximately 60,000 yuan. It was resolved to temporarily record this amount in the accounts and deduct it in the next year if there is a surplus.</p>
<p>(3) The budget for the next year, because the US dollar is expected to depreciate even more than this year, the total amount of funds available to the Foundation will decrease from more than 1.7 million yuan to approximately 1.34 million yuan.  The budget for self-run and jointly run enterprises accounts for approximately 920,000 yuan, and continuing subsidies account for 420,000 yuan. The detailed allocation is as follows:</p>

<p>(4) Due to the reduction in funds this year, subsidies are temporarily limited to institutions that have continued to apply.  Applications from newly applying institutions and the joint meeting of the Second Boxer Indemnity Fund institutions will not be considered this year due to a lack of funds available for allocation.</p>
<p>(5) The provisions of Article 18 of the Foundation's rules were amended to change the annual general meeting to October and the annual meeting to April, so that subsidized institutions can finalize their next year's budget earlier.</p>
<p>(6) The election of directors and staff whose terms have expired resulted in the following: (A) Directors Shi Zhaoji, Xu Xinliu, and Hu Shi, whose terms had expired, were unanimously re-elected. (B) Chairman Cai Yuanpei, Vice Chairmen Meng Lu and Zhou Yichun, Honorary Secretary Hu Shi, Honorary Accountants Benoit and Jin Shaoji, and Executive Committee members Gu Lin, Zhou Yichun, and Jin Shaoji, whose terms had expired, were unanimously re-elected.</p>
<p>(7) It was resolved that the date and location of the next regular meeting would be decided by the Executive Committee. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Ren Hongjun Speaks</h3>
<p>After the meeting, according to the Chief Secretary of the Foundation, Ren Hongjun, the annual meeting decided on the budget for the next year for the Foundation's own undertakings and those jointly run and entrusted to other institutions, as well as the various subsidized institutions that have continued to apply. Previous rumors that "the Foundation will suspend subsidies to various subsidized institutions due to the depreciation of the US dollar and the resulting damage to funds" were not true. It was only stipulated that recent applicants would not be considered for the time being.  The various academic institutions that applied previously and are currently continuing to apply for subsidies will continue to receive subsidies. As for the date and location of the Foundation's 11th annual meeting, the Executive Committee will decide within days, he said.</p>

<h3>Trial Match Concluded Yesterday The Hot Weather Greatly Reduced Enthusiasm Few Spectators, Little Excitement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club's intercity trial match was held for the second day yesterday. The sweltering heat and humidity caused heavy sweating, resulting in few spectators. The players also reduced their performance due to the heat. The match did not start until 3:30 PM and ended hastily in a lackluster manner. The results of the three matches are as follows:</p>
<p>(Doubles) Defoe/Bonnet (6-1, 6-1) Qiu Feihai/Wang Wenzheng (Singles) Carlson (6-4, 6-8, 6-6) Machida</p>
<p>(Doubles) Lin Baohua/Zheng Zhaojia (6-1, 6-1) Stoke/Cole</p>
<h3>Doubles</h3>
<p>Both doubles matches were one-sided, with a significant disparity in strength, leaving no room for competition. Qiu Feihai and Wang Wenzheng were completely helpless, barely avoiding a shutout. The partnership of Defoe and Bonnet was like icing on the cake. Lin Baohua (replacing Yu Tianguang) and Zheng Zhaojia defeated Stoke and Cole effortlessly. Zheng Zhaojia's performance was particularly impressive. The only flaw was too many service errors. Stoke managed to win the fourth game of the first set and the sixth game of the second set, narrowly avoiding a complete defeat.</p>
<h3>Singles</h3>
<p>The two doubles matches were completed in half an hour each. Only the singles match dragged on for about two hours without a clear winner. Machida's forehand and backhand strokes were skilled and steady, and his stamina was good. Carlson was inferior in these aspects, but his other shots were far superior to Machida's. However, due to the hot weather, he could not run, resulting in many errors. He won the first set 6-4, and Machida took the second set 8-6 after leading 5-2. In the third set, Machida again led 5-2, but Carlson caught up to 5-5 and then 6-6. Both players were exhausted and declared a draw, with no winner determined. Lin and Zheng, the doubles team, then took the court, and the intercity lawn tennis trial match concluded.</p>

<h3>China Women's Physical Education Normal School Summer Teaching of Basic Gymnastics</h3>
<p>Principal Du personally teaches the world's latest gymnastics</p>
<p>In the past, gymnastics was the first to promote Sweden, which has fallen behind. Twenty years ago, Danish physical educator Buck felt that Swedish gymnastics was not perfect, so he created basic gymnastics and tried it successfully. It is now popular in England, America, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Belgium, Finland, and other countries. Ms. Kesh, the former director of the Department of Physical Education of Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, first taught it in our country. Recently, physical education experts Wu Yunrui, Hao Gengsheng, and others advocated that our country must promote it, but there are few people who understand the teaching method of basic gymnastics. Now, Ms. Du Yufei, the principal of China Women's Physical Education Normal School, No. 517 Julieda Road, has a lot of research on this kind of gymnastics, and her teaching of students is excellent on weekdays. Now, during the summer vacation, in order to promote the world's latest and most beneficial gymnastics, she is willing to teach in person. The class will start on July 5th. Teachers of primary and secondary schools and those who are interested in studying basic gymnastics can go to contact from now on every morning.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Imperial Fragrance Misty Record</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In addition, there were fresh bamboo shoots, and extremely delicate tea buds, which were also the Empress Dowager's favorite vegetarian dishes; whether for "formal meals" or "snacks," she always instructed them to prepare these.</p>
<p>China produces the most varieties of mushrooms, about seven or eight or more. Mongolia also has them, and they are larger than those produced elsewhere in the interior, and the taste is exceptionally rich. The Empress Dowager was especially fond of mushrooms, so whether it was in any dish, as long as it was not absolutely impossible, there would always be fragrant mushrooms or matsu mushrooms mixed in. But for me, I did not have any special fondness for mushrooms. I felt that the taste of Shandong cabbage was truly the most wonderful of all vegetables; its leaves are almost pure white, tender and sweet, and I would often eat as much as I could, not wanting to stop.</p>
<p>There are truly too many famous dishes like Shandong cabbage in various parts of China to count, and among them, the products of Sichuan province are the most precious and the most popular. For example, silver fungus is extremely expensive, often costing ten or twenty taels of silver to buy a small box. They are a kind of inferior plant that grows parasitically on old pine trees, but because it is difficult to find good ones, the price is unreasonably high. Moreover, even if ordinary people or officials are willing to spend a lot of money to buy it, it is not easy to get the best; the reason is that the best silver fungus has become a kind of monopoly for officials in Sichuan province to present to the Empress Dowager; they hire many workers to search for the best silver fungus all year round, and bring it to please the Empress Dowager.</p>
<p>When silver fungus is transported, it is always dried very thoroughly, and it is also packed in various kinds of brocade boxes according to its value; the most exquisite brocade boxes often cost several taels of silver each. The value of the silver fungus contained inside can be imagined! But although the value is so high, its taste is really not known for what it is good for. It is neither salty nor sweet, and there is no fragrance; in short, eating it is like eating nothing. So it is always cooked together in chicken broth or other fresh soups. (72)</p>
<h3>Liuzidiao of Qufu</h3>
<p>— Bing Yuan</p>
<p>Words are the voice of the heart, and when words are not enough, they are sung. It is undoubtedly certain that singing is a kind of expression of human emotions. As world culture advances greatly, human intelligence and reason also increase day by day; thus, from intangible songs, tangible dramas emerge. Further branching and tracing the origins, to this day, it has become one of the eight major arts. In the early days of the germination of drama in our country, it was mostly adapted to local conditions, promoting its art, and also exposing the local customs and human feelings of various places and various societies. For example,</p>
<p>Zhili province has "Pengpeng Opera," Shaanxi province has "Bangzi Opera," and eastern Shandong has "Liuzidiao," all of which are sufficient to represent the local customs of these three provinces, and are also symbols of cultural relics. Before the rise of Western opera, "Bangzi Opera" also held the center of drama for an era, but unfortunately, the plot and tune, in the voice of extreme sadness, tend to be highly intense, and the principles of script compilation and singing are often abandoned regardless of ethics, so although there are shouts of killing, there is no spirit of promoting national bravery in a coordinated way. Every plot lacks legal principles, so it is appropriate that in today's stage art, when striving for rapid advancement, it cannot allow it to exist safely. "Pengpeng Opera" is indeed a kind of local opera, obscene and vulgar, even more inferior, and has not yet been able to enter the hall of elegance, so how can we hope to move into the realm of art? Only "Liuzidiao," which is gentle, quiet, and elegant, with a clear voice and a unique tune, should not be ignored as a local small opera. According to legend, "Liuzidiao" is a unique sound of Qufu, Shandong, known as "nine tunes, eighteen tones, and seventy-two hums." When singing, the flute and huqin are used, and the blowing and pulling correspond to each other, supplemented by cymbals, gongs, and drums, imitating sounds and shapes, which is quite interesting. If it is said to be close to Kunqu Opera, it is actually not. There is a play called "Coming Late," which is the most common script, and its musical pieces include "Yuan Ersan Ban Wawa" and "Xuelianzhi," which are also like the division of "fast, slow, and original" beats in Western opera. As for the reason why it is named "Liuzidiao," it is said to be the legacy of a man of Lu, but whether Mr. Zhonglian had such heroic elegance on that day, raised his voice and sang, and actually left his wonderful sound to thousands of years later, I think I have never seen the ancients, and I have no such courage to dare to affirm it.</p>
<h3>Wu Ma</h3>
<p>— Bi Shan</p>
<p>Although Wu Ma is old, she still has the strength to wash clothes for people and earn money to buy food. Therefore, there are always her footprints in our dormitory every day. She is very loyal and always returns the banknotes and coins that she finds in someone's pocket intact. Therefore, everyone respects her and lets her enter and exit the dormitory freely, and no one has ever supervised her.</p>
<p>Recently, several students recruited a young and beautiful girl from outside to come to the dormitory to pick up clothes to wash. Wu Ma didn't know, but she felt that the weather was getting hotter and hotter, and the number of people changing clothes was decreasing day by day. One morning the day before yesterday, she just came outside the dormitory door and ran into a beautiful girl, carrying a large package of clothes, walking out. Several students were following behind, walking and laughing. Wu Ma took a few steps back, leaned against the wall, and took two breaths of cold air. After watching them walk away, she said to herself, "It seems that my rice bowl is in danger!"</p>
<p>A few days later, the owner discovered that several students were hiding laziness. After investigating the root cause, it turned out that they were chatting with this young laundry girl in the dormitory. The owner was unwilling, so he scolded the students and forbade the laundry girl from coming to the dormitory again.</p>
<p>When Wu Ma heard this news, she said to people behind her back, "God has eyes after all! Otherwise, old people, even if they have strength, will not be able to earn a living."</p>
<h3>Russian People</h3>
<p>— Nai Ling</p>
<p>We are used to seeing Russian people in Shanghai wearing ragged clothes, with tired faces, wandering the streets and alleys, especially in the French Concession.</p>
<p>We don't know when these Russian people who drift everywhere arrived in Shanghai. All we know is that these Russian people came from Russia and were aristocrats and powerful people who were expelled from Russia after 1917. At the same time, some people also call these Russian people White Russians.</p>
<p>Yesterday, on Avenue Edward VII, I met such a Russian person again. He was surrounded by many of our countrymen. Like other Russian people, he was drunk and staggered in the crowd, laughing loudly. Everyone thought it was funny and tried their best to force him to play. In the end, a guy eating sugar cane put the cane residue into the back of his collar. The Russian suddenly turned from joy to anger and became angry. But the person who put the cane residue had already run far away, and the Russian chased after him madly, and many people watching the excitement followed behind him.</p>
<p>Still, he ran fast and finally caught up with the prankster. But he only made gestures, asking the man why he put the cane residue in his collar. The person who was questioned said nothing, and stretched out his bowl-sized fist and shook it in front of the Russian. The Russian ignored it and continued to make gestures. As he continued to make gestures, he was caught off guard and was punched in the face and fell to the ground. This time, the Russian was really angry. He climbed up and rushed forward, but many people watching the excitement pushed him one way and another, and pushed the Russian to the ground again. Then everyone laughed hahaha.</p>
<p>Small Recipes</p>
<h3>Summer Vegetarian Dishes</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>In the summer, the most important thing is cleanliness, especially when it comes to food, you must pay attention to it. For example, with daily meals, if you are careless and grab any rough fish and meat, regardless of whether it's edible, you just stuff your mouth and chew, which can easily cause problems. As the ancients said, "Calamity comes from the mouth, and illness enters through the mouth." These two sentences are profound lessons. Now, as we vigorously promote the New Life Movement, I believe that not only should we be clean, but vegetarianism is also suitable, and from an economic point of view, it is more in line with the principle of thrift. Therefore, I briefly write about several common home-cooked dishes to present to comrades who pay attention to hygiene. As for whether the taste is the same or not, it depends on everyone's personal preferences, so everyone must do it themselves!</p>
<p>Mung beans, originally a cooling food, are made into porridge in the summer, eaten as "mung bean soup," or made into cakes called "mung bean cakes," which are extremely delicious. However, they can only be regarded as snacks to satisfy hunger and cannot be used as dishes. Therefore, in the past, the extremely clever put mung beans and water into wooden barrels to make the temperature suitable, and when they were almost sprouting, snow-white sprouts would grow. This is "mung bean sprouts." The price is cheap, and the goods are pure. Looking at them, they are as white as silver. They can be soaked in boiling water, and after soaking, mixed with soy sauce and sesame oil, served as a cold dish, and are extremely refreshing to the mouth, without any greasiness. If they are cooked, stir-frying them with bean oil does not take much time, only three or four minutes to take them out of the pot. Or add some very tender chives, about one-tenth or two-tenths of the amount of mung bean sprouts. White and green, the colors are truly beautiful. The predecessors named it "Jade Ruyi," which makes sense because, regardless of what kind of family, they can usually be served as side dishes. In addition to being simple and economical, they can also relieve summer heat and can be considered unique.</p>
<p>Luohan Cai (Monk's Vegetable) is originally a specialty of our Jiading. I am afraid other places do not know about it. This kind of vegetable is wild, and its size is the same as shepherd's purse, but it is not found everywhere. However, in the west countryside like the Huangdu and Anting areas, it grows slightly more on the edges of fields and ridges. In other southeast villages, it is rarely seen at all. Recently, some people have collected its seeds and sown them artificially, but in fact, they are not as good as the wild ones because the fresh flavor is weak, and the fragrance is not enough. This is unavoidable. The usual way to eat it is to use salt and vegetables in early spring, repeatedly press them by hand until they are cooked, then squeeze out the water, and then put them into jars, seal them well, and place them upside down in a very dry rice straw ash tank. After the yellow plum season of the year, they can be eaten. If done properly, they will not spoil even after two or three years. Therefore, those who specialize in making this kind of vegetable for business always falsely claim the words "Chen Luohan Cai" on their signs. Speaking of reality, I am afraid it is not even half a year old! When people eat it, most of them use it as porridge vegetables. They don't know that making soup with it is much fresher than Xue Li Hong (preserved mustard greens). If you imitate foreigners' methods, after cooking, use a spatula to flatten it in the pot into an extremely soft sand-like paste, and mix it with Luohan Cai, about one-tenth or two-tenths, and then stir-fry it a few times, or add some burnt salt. Eating it is truly infinitely delicious. Because foreign taro is a tuber, round like the face of a Bodhisattva, some people named this kind of vegetable "Luohan Jian Mituo" (Arhat Sees Amitabha), which is also a very cheap and refreshing food.</p>
<p>Laotang Xishi Ru (Hot Broth Xishi's Milk) tofu can indeed only be made through chemical reactions. It is said that it was invented by King Huainan of the Han Dynasty. Even now, regardless of whether they are rich or poor, everyone likes to eat it. Therefore, wherever there is a market, a tofu shop will always open because it is cheap, palatable, and can be made into various forms besides tofu, such as skin, clothing, strips, dried, sauce, and various patterns. It is an excellent auxiliary ingredient when added to other dishes. When making tofu, the solid that solidifies on the surface when poured from the pot into the jar is the most refined, whitest part of the upper layer, called "tofu flower." Although the price is slightly more expensive, its purity is truly unparalleled. If you estimate and make soup to eat, it is truly no less than a hibiscus egg. If you dislike its blandness, you can add the juice squeezed out after simmering soybeans, then its taste will be mellow, and there is no need for monosodium glutamate, etc. Or add some pickled mustard tuber slices, and if you can eat chili oil, drip a little bit. The white tofu surface shows a reddish color, isn't it delicious and beautiful? Calling it "Laotang Xishi Ru," this name is quite appropriate.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 31: Three Encounters, White-Clad Soldiers Charge the Snowy Array, the Entire Battalion Sacrifices, Red Eyes Enter the Gun Forest</p>
<p>Although Zhao Ziqiang tried his best to struggle to lead this company of brothers, he was not made of copper and iron. Therefore, when he could not bear it any longer, he led these people and started running. First, they ran suddenly along the main road in this snow gully towards the mountain cliff. After running up, they ran back in one breath. After running like this twice, everyone's body developed a little warmth, although not as much as usual, it prevented them from shivering. Therefore, Ziqiang sent four brothers to be scouts, and at the same time, on the mountain slopes on both sides of this narrow gully, he chose good positions and had dozens of soldiers lie in ambush, each with a heavy machine gun, quietly waiting for an opportunity. Ziqiang was also very anxious. If the enemy didn't come, the brothers would not be able to endure waiting here in the cold. Seeing the sun setting in the west, except for some bleak clouds in the western half of the sky, the sky had already turned light gray. In the gray night, there were vaguely two or three points of starlight, reflecting the ground covered with white snow, and it was impossible to describe the feeling in his heart, only that it was not very peaceful. After pondering for a long time, he looked up at the starlight in the sky, large and small, scattered all over the sky. The brothers squatted under the snow cliff sheltering from the wind, and no one let out a cough or even a breath. The wind was not blowing, and the grass and trees were not moving, as if the entire universe had paused for a few minutes. Just as they were quietly waiting for the change to come, they saw the scout who had been sent out running over, first shouting a report. Then he said: Shan Desheng encountered a spy at the intersection of the small road in front of the mountain. The spy did not resist and was willing to be captured. He is now under the cliff. Ziqiang said: Bring him up quickly. As he spoke, two brothers pushed a traitor up through the accumulated snow. When that person reached Ziqiang, he knelt down long ago. Crying, he said: Company commander, I am Chinese. The enemy forced me to be a traitor! I will report to you that the enemy has a battalion of men and is going to attack the fortress from here and will arrive soon. (423)</p>

<h3>Further Elaboration on Typhoid Fever 2 (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Later generations, based on the theory of meridians, could not adapt to the six-meridian theory of typhoid fever. Therefore, there were those who spoke of the six meridians by separating them from the twelve meridians. Generally speaking, the ancients spoke often of typhoid fever being transmitted through the meridians, from the outside to the inside. In the Ming Dynasty, Fang Zhonghang wrote "Annotations to Typhoid Fever," with a diagram at the beginning of the volume, believing that yang diseases are on the surface, from the outside to the inside, and yin diseases are in the interior, from the bottom to the top. His theory roughly said, "When wind and cold affect people, the skin must bear it. The skin is on the outside of the body, so it is called the surface. The surface corresponds to the Taiyang Foot Bladder Meridian. What does 'corresponds' mean? The bladder opens to the front. The front is the way of the yang surface, so it corresponds. Speaking of the Taiyang without mentioning the bladder meridian and the skin, it is self-evident. However, the Taiyang also has the Hand Small Intestine Meridian. How do we know that what is spoken of is not this? The small intestine meridian does not correspond to the skin. If it does not correspond, then it does not dominate the disease. If it does not dominate the disease, then it is not enough to speak of. If it is not enough to speak of, then it is not within the words. It can also be known." This regards the Taiyang as the outermost layer of the skin of the body and uses the bladder meridian to correspond with it. It is impossible to connect the bladder and the skin, so he uses the opening to the front as an explanation. Then the eyes, nose, mouth, and reproductive organs all open to the front, so they all can be considered Taiyang. His forced association is like this. Moreover, since he used the bladder to associate with the skin, he then said that the small intestine meridian does not correspond to the skin, so it is not within the words. This is the reason why typhoid fever transmits through the foot but not the hand. It is truly domineering and willful, directing himself as he pleases.</p>
<p>Fang also said, "Yangming is when the evil of wind and cold passes through the skin and then advances. What connects to the skin is muscle. Not saying muscle, but saying Yangming, is because muscle is in the middle of the five compounds and is the center of the body. Internally, it corresponds to the Yangming Foot Stomach Meridian. What does 'corresponds' mean? The stomach is also in the middle and is the sea of the five viscera and six bowels. It combines the center of the interior and exterior, using center to combine with center. Therefore, it is also called Zhengyang. Then, although Yangming has two meridians, its Hand Large Intestine Meridian does not correspond to the muscle and is not within the words. What is spoken of is the stomach meridian. It can be known." This regards Yangming as the middle layer of the surface and uses muscle to represent it, forcibly associating it with the Foot Yangming Stomach Meridian. It is impossible to connect the stomach and the muscle, so he uses the position in the middle as an explanation. His forced association is again like this.</p>
<p>Fang also said, "Shaoyang is when the evil passes through the muscle and then advances. Then it reaches the flesh of the body and the outside of the viscera, what is called half-exterior and half-interior. It is the combination of the Shaoyang Foot Gallbladder Meridian. What does 'corresponds' mean? The gallbladder does not stand on its own. It adheres to the liver and does not separate. Externally, it does not belong to the body and does not separate from the body. Internally, it does not belong to the viscera and does not separate from the viscera. It shares the same path, so it corresponds." This regards Shaoyang as the inside of the body and the outside of the viscera and uses the Foot Shaoyang Gallbladder Meridian to associate with it. He uses the gallbladder not standing on its own and adhering to the liver and not separating as an explanation. His forced association is again like this.</p>
<p>Fang also said, "Taiyin is the spleen. The spleen resides in the middle and manages affairs, so it follows Shaoyang and is the first to receive among the three yin. Shaoyin is the kidney. Jueyin is the liver. The yin path is reversed and dominates downwards, so although the liver is near and resides above, the spleen and kidney, although far, reside below. The kidney receives after the spleen, and the liver receives last. The yin path reverses from bottom to top, so it is naturally like this." Since Fang regarded yin diseases as being from bottom to top, and the spleen resides in the middle position, which does not conform to his theory of bottom to top, he then uses residing in the middle and managing affairs as an explanation. It can truly be said that he does whatever he wants.</p>
<p>Fang also said, "Why do the heart and lungs not receive it? The Ling Shu says, 'The heart is the master of the entire body of a person. It does not receive external evils because it does not receive external evils, so it is in a high position and resides above.' The lungs dominate outwards and do not receive inwards, so they are highest and most above." This uses the heart and lungs not receiving evils as the reason why typhoid fever does not transmit through the three yin of the hand. Speaking of it now, there are many diseases in which the heart and lungs receive external evils. It is clearly documented. Moreover, the ancients never said that the lungs do not receive evils. He arbitrarily says that they are in a high position and reside above, not receiving external evils, to associate with the theory of not transmitting through the hand. His delusion is extreme. The one who continued Fang's explanation, only speaking of the foot meridians and not speaking of the hand meridians, was Wei Litong's "Original Meaning of Treatise on Cold Damage." It roughly said, "The Foot Taiyang Bladder Meridian runs on the back of the body. Initially sensing wind and evil, it is mostly sensed on the back as the meridian division of the Foot Taiyang, so the disease evil is in this. The treatment is also in this. Moreover, the Foot Taiyang dominates the skin, like the sky that encompasses everything, and it does not only run on the back of the body. As for the Hand Taiyang Small Intestine, the disease evil does not reach it, so it does not need to be treated." This uses the Taiyang running on the back of the body, which is following the old words of the meridians. And then uses the Taiyang dominating the skin, which is using Fang's theory. He encompasses everything, wanting to consolidate his theory, not choosing whether the matter can be relied upon and the words can be proven, to use as the foundation. He only picks up what can be convenient for his theory, twisting and forcing associations to fill the aid. He is like the beggar from Qi in Dong Guo, afraid of not being satisfied. Another trick is taken. Where can you not get drunk and full? However, if learning is like this, few are not ridiculed by their family.</p>
<h3>Talking About Hyperhidrosis and Body Odor</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>Summer has arrived. The humid heat steams people. We cannot help but suffer from sweating like rain. Patients with hyperhidrosis feel even more unbearable. People with body odor suffer even more. Therefore, I will discuss hyperhidrosis and body odor.</p>
<p>(1) Where Does Sweat Come From?</p>
<p>Our skin can be divided into three layers. The first layer is called the epidermis. The second layer is called the dermis. The third layer is called the subcutaneous tissue. I have described this in detail in "Common Knowledge of Skin Diseases" in this publication. Sweat glands are a type of tubular gland in the second layer, the dermis. They can also be divided into three parts, namely the sweat gland body, the excretory duct, and the duct pore. Inside the wall of the sweat gland duct is a type of cell. Sweat is secreted from these gland cells. It passes through the excretory duct and reaches the surface of the skin from the duct pore. The skin of our entire body, except for the glans penis and the inner surface of the foreskin, has sweat glands. The number of sweat glands varies in different parts of the body. The most are on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, forehead, wings of the nose, forehead, armpits, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Composition and Secretion Volume of Sweat</p>
<p>Sweat is a watery, transparent liquid. It tastes salty and has an unpleasant odor. It is acidic. If there is excessive secretion, it is alkaline. It contains 1% solid matter and 99% water. This solid matter contains salt, potassium, sulfuric acid, sulfate, phosphate, urea, uric acid, fatty acids, etc. If sweating is intense, a lot of urea is excreted. A sandy substance adheres to the surface of the skin. Sweat glands not only secrete the various substances mentioned above but can also excrete drugs and bacteria. For example, bromine, iodine, arsenic, mercury, sulfur, alcohol, opium, ipecac, etc.</p>
<p>Speaking of the amount of sweating, it is very uncertain. There are great differences due to individual differences, external temperature, and different body parts. Most people only know that there is sweating in the summer. In fact, our skin excretes sweat at all times. However, the amount of excretion is very small and turns into gas, making it difficult to see with the naked eye. According to Daries' report, the average person secretes about 1300 cc of sweat in one day and night. If you are working, you can secrete 4600 cc in one hour, which is as much as eight or nine pounds. It's really heavy sweating.</p>
<p>(3) The Purpose of Sweating</p>
<p>There are two purposes of sweating. One is to regulate body temperature. When our body is at rest, the body temperature is not too high, and sweating is sparse. If you are exercising or it is hot in the summer, the body temperature rises, and sweating increases. What is the reason for this? Originally, according to the principles of physics, every liquid that turns into a gas needs temperature. Now, because the body temperature rises, the evaporation of sweat is used to capture the body temperature so that people do not feel very hot. Therefore, after we sweat a lot, the body temperature can be lowered. This is the body temperature regulating effect of sweating. Doctors use sweating therapy for patients with fever. The same is true. Obese people are more likely to be afraid of heat than ordinary people when the temperature rises, and they sweat a lot. This is because their subcutaneous fat layer is too thick and cannot fully dissipate body temperature. Therefore, they are afraid of heat. To dissipate more body temperature, they sweat. The second purpose of sweating is to act as a substitute for the function of the kidneys. Originally, waste and water in our body are excreted from the kidneys. If there is a disease of the kidneys, and the excretion of urine is insufficient, dangerous diseases can occur. At this time, doctors can use sweating therapy. For example, taking medicine internally or using physical therapy to make the patient sweat. The reason why the kidneys excrete harmful waste and water is that when there is a lot of sweating, the amount of urine is reduced. This is a fact that we experience every day.</p>
<p>(4) What is Called Hyperhidrosis and the Classification of Hyperhidrosis</p>
<p>Hyperhidrosis is defined as excessive secretion of sweat glands. At the same time, it mostly occurs in conjunction with other diseases, or it occurs continuously due to other diseases. Speaking of the types of hyperhidrosis, they can be divided into two types. One is called systemic hyperhidrosis. The other is called local hyperhidrosis.</p>
<p>(5) Symptoms and Causes of Systemic Hyperhidrosis</p>
<p>Speaking of systemic hyperhidrosis, such as profuse sweating during labor and summer, sweating like rain in obese patients, cold sweat on the back during shame and fright, and a handful of cold sweat when victory or defeat is at stake, these can all fall within the scope of physiology. However, people who are anemic and frail are prone to sweating, which is close to pathology. In addition, women during menstruation, menopause, and people with neurasthenia are often prone to systemic hyperhidrosis. In addition, the sweating of febrile patients when the fever subsides is called beneficial sweating. The night sweats of patients with severe pulmonary tuberculosis are called night sweats. The cold sweats of patients with collapse are called collapse sweats. This also belongs to systemic hyperhidrosis.</p>
<p>(6) Symptoms and Causes of Local Hyperhidrosis</p>
<p>Local hyperhidrosis can also be divided into unilateral hyperhidrosis and bilateral hyperhidrosis. Unilateral hyperhidrosis is when sweating often favors one side, or the sweating on one side is particularly more than on the other side. This is often seen in healthy people after eating irritating foods. It can also be caused by sympathetic nerve paralysis, migraines, trauma to the sympathetic nerves of the head, trigeminal neuralgia, head neuralgia, intercostal neuralgia, lumbar neuralgia, and diseases of the brain and spinal cord. Unilateral hyperhidrosis occurs.</p>
<p>Local hyperhidrosis is mostly bilateral. It occurs on the palms and soles of the feet. Sweat in the perineum and armpits is also common.</p>
<p>People with foot sweat not only have moist sweat, but often develop a foul odor due to the decomposition of sweat. The stratum corneum of the skin appears white and swollen. Blisters and cracks develop between the toes. Because of the itching, it even interferes with sleep. After scratching, it becomes painful and difficult to walk. Therefore, in the summer when there is a lot of sweat, it is even more unbearable. The feet of such patients are mostly damp and cold, and they appear bluish-purple. In winter, they are also prone to frostbite.</p>
<p>People with a lot of hand sweat often have moist sweat on their palms. The bluish-purple color and cold of the hands are the same as those of people with foot sweat. This is partly because the blood circulation is weak and partly because the evaporation of sweat takes away the local temperature. Most people with hand sweat are teenagers, especially those with neurasthenia and anemia.</p>
<p>In addition to hand sweat and foot sweat, local hyperhidrosis can also occur in the perineum, armpits, around the anus, under the breasts, and in the folds of the neck. At the same time, because the skin in these areas rubs against each other, it causes redness, moisture, itching, burning, pain, and other symptoms of dermatitis. Patients feel the distress of hyperhidrosis.</p>
<p>(7) Treatment for Hyperhidrosis</p>
<p>Speaking of the treatment of hyperhidrosis, understanding the reasons mentioned above, it is natural not to be satisfied with local treatment. Now it can be divided into two types to talk about. The first type is systemic therapy. Because in the reasons for hyperhidrosis mentioned above, there are anemia, weakness, and neurasthenia, etc., the original disease must be treated fundamentally in order to cure hyperhidrosis.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Therefore, in systemic therapy, cold water rubbing, seawater baths, hot spring baths, arsenic iron, and other tonics are indispensable. As for symptomatic therapy, agents that paralyze sweat nerves can be given, such as "Atropine," etc. That requires a doctor's prescription.</p>
<p>The second type is local treatment. The systemic therapy mentioned above is the treatment of the cause. However, it is not something that can be effective in a hurry. Therefore, local treatment must be carried out at the same time. There are many methods of local treatment. It can be divided into physical therapy and drug therapy. Physical therapies, such as mercury quartz lamp and X-ray irradiation, are very effective. In drug therapy, there are those that use medicinal agents, those that use water agents, those that use ointment agents, and those that use liniment agents. There are also many drugs used. For example, salicylic acid, boric acid, "Tannalbin," "Formalin," "Chloral Hydrate," etc.</p>
<p>(8) Hygiene for Local Hyperhidrosis</p>
<p>The treatment methods mentioned above must be done under the guidance of a doctor. However, self-care is also essential. For example, the affected area should be kept clean and washed frequently with alum water. Socks and shoes should be changed frequently. Or put loofah pads in the soles of the socks and gauze between the toes to absorb sweat and prevent dermatitis from occurring after the sweat decomposes.</p>
<p>(9) What is Called Body Odor?</p>
<p>Originally, there is a bit of odor when sweat decomposes, commonly called sweat odor. Usually, people who have a lot of foot sweat and are unwilling to change their socks frequently develop an odor due to the decomposition and decay of sweat. If there is an odor in fresh sweat, it is called smelly sweat. The most common place for it to occur is in the armpits, so there are the specific terms armpit odor and body odor. The armpit sweat of black slaves contains a lot of fatty acids, so a rancid buttery odor often occurs. White people also often have a unique armpit odor, commonly called foreign body odor. Not many people in our country suffer from armpit odor.</p>
<p>People with armpit odor do not feel it much when sweat secretion is low in winter. When the weather is hot or after mental excitement, drinking alcohol, etc., the secretion of sweat glands is vigorous, and the armpit odor is particularly worse. It feels like all sorts of inconveniences for social interaction. Some young couples have even divorced because of this. Therefore, people with armpit odor suffer greatly mentally.</p>
<p>(10) Treatment for Body Odor</p>
<p>First, cleanliness should be maintained, which means bathing frequently. Apply salicylic acid alcohol, mint alcohol, etc. locally. However, most cannot be cured permanently. To shrink the sweat gland tissue, you can use X-rays or radium needles for irradiation. It also needs to be repeated. As for the most stubborn body odor, it is best to remove the skin of the armpit area. The sweat glands are removed along with it, and there is no more suffering from body odor.</p>
<p>(11) What is Chromhidrosis?</p>
<p>Chromhidrosis is when the sweat secreted by the patient has yellow, red, blue, green, black, and other colors. The reason for this is not fully understood at present. Some say that chemical substances are mixed in the sweat. Others say that bacteria that produce pigments are mixed in the sweat. Most are neurotic.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Hygiene Martial Law Order and Summer Disease Prevention Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Huang Yiqing</p>
<p>(Spoken at the Shanghai Sino-Western Broadcasting Radio Station at 4 PM on June 21st)</p>
<p>The Shanghai 13th Hygiene Games has issued a hygiene martial law order that includes the following five central alert matters:</p>
<p>㈠ Spitting must be done in a safe place</p>
<p>㈡ Urination must be done in the toilet</p>
<p>㈢ Garbage must be dumped into the trash can</p>
<p>㈣ Drinking water must be boiled water</p>
<p>㈤ Accept epidemic prevention injections</p>
<p>Just now, Mr. Zhu Hengbi was unable to come and lecture due to important matters, so he asked Yiqing to talk to everyone in his place:</p>
<p>In the summer, infectious diseases are very easy to spread, such as cholera, dysentery, summer diarrhea, etc., which are all caused by eating food carelessly, and contracting these disease-causing bacteria through the mouth. People who study hygiene call it fecal-oral transmission. Because the source of its transmission all comes from feces: all from the feces of patients suffering from those many diseases. These germs are transmitted to the sources of food and drink through two routes: "water" and "air." The water route is the raw water in rivers and wells; what comes by air is the fly, which is like a "germ airplane." We occasionally drink water containing germs or eat food contaminated with germs. People with strong bodies may be able to resist it, but if the body is not very healthy, they will simply get sick without resistance. After getting sick, they may even die. Therefore, in order to prevent infection, it is best to implement a "martial law" against germs in the food and drink we ingest. This kind of work is not difficult to do, but it is also not easy. In the final analysis, it depends on how we handle raw water and flies. Regarding the handling of raw water, we are very fortunate in Shanghai that most households have been able to drink tap water. Through various bacterial, physical, and chemical actions in the water plant, 98-99% of all the bacteria contained in the raw water have already been killed. For the few that have not been killed, whether they are fecal-oral pathogens or not, we can boil it again, stipulating that only boiled water is to be drunk, and using heat to kill all the remaining bacteria. At the same time, promote the effectiveness of heat, stipulating that all food should be eaten while it is hot, so as to avoid being prepared for a long time, stagnating there, waiting for flies to crawl over it and sting it before eating, which still inevitably leads to infection with those germs. Even when washing fruits and tableware, it is stipulated that at least cold boiled water must be used, and it is best to use boiling water. As for all raw and cold items, except for frozen items freshly taken out of the refrigerator, there is naturally no need to mention them. If you really do this every day, being careful at every step, you can absolutely avoid being infected with any fecal-oral diseases. In the inland areas, where there is no tap water, you can only rely on the traditional method of boiling drinking water and using heat. However, relying on traditional methods and utilizing heat can also be safe. This is the essence of the fourth article of this Shanghai Municipal Hygiene Martial Law Order, which focuses on promoting "drinking water must be boiled water."</p>
<p>As I just said, several infectious diseases that are very easy to spread in the summer are all transmitted through feces. Clearly, when it comes to hygiene, if the feces are handled well, the source of infectious diseases will also be blocked. Therefore, we should not randomly "dump waste" when urinating or defecating, but must go to the toilet to "pay respects." If the toilet uses a flush toilet (flush toilet), it will naturally flow into the sewage field through the sewage pipe, and through bacterial and chemical actions, all the bacteria contained in the feces will be killed, and the sewage will flow into the river, so that the disease will not spread again. Even if a chamber pot is used, the feces will be transported to the countryside by workers, stored in a manure pit, and after one or two months, those many germs will naturally be eliminated and completely wiped out by various putrefactive bacteria, so that live germs will not be revived and spread to cause epidemics. This is the essence of the second article of the martial law order, which promotes "urination must be done in the toilet." The reason for talking about urination and not defecation is because urination can already be stipulated to be done in the toilet, so there is no need to mention defecation!</p>
<p>As for the third article of the martial law order, "garbage must be dumped into the trash can," one point that is very relevant to summer disease prevention is that if garbage is spread everywhere, it will easily attract flies to gather. Getting close to flies easily allows food and drink to be contaminated by flies. Spreading it everywhere is unsightly, but that is a minor matter. Putting it into the trash can and sealing it tightly, defending firmly and clearing the field, can at least reduce the number of flies. The fourth article, "spitting must be done safely," is the central tenet of preventing tuberculosis (consumption). When it comes to its closest relationship with the hygiene of the season, if there is sputum everywhere, there will always be more flies. Sputum is best spat into a paper cup and burned at any time. Failing that, a covered spittoon should be used. If we do not spit everywhere in our homes, we can of course reduce one thing that attracts flies. This is something everyone knows.</p>
<p>In summary, if we handle our feces well, handle our drinking water well, and handle the environment where we dump garbage and sputum well, the chances of fecal-oral pathogens entering our mouths and intestines will naturally gradually decrease. When we live through the summer, we can also leisurely and comfortably pay attention to some principles of hygiene.</p>
<p>According to what I said above, after tidying up the environment and abstaining from raw and cold food, taking it a step further, for personal safety, everyone must hire a "bodyguard" to resist the invasion of germs丨丨that is, the fifth article of the martial law order, "accept epidemic prevention injections," get vaccinated. After getting vaccinated, the body will produce a substance that resists bacteria. It can control the pathogens that may invade the body, preventing them from causing disease: after getting a cholera vaccine, even if you are infected with cholera bacteria, you will not get cholera. After getting typhoid and paratyphoid A and B vaccines, even if you are infected with typhoid bacteria or paratyphoid bacteria, you will not get typhoid and paratyphoid fever. What's especially wonderful is that in recent years, mixed vaccines of cholera, typhoid, and paratyphoid fever have been used. After getting one shot, you can rely on the power generated by the body to prevent the invasion of several pathogens. This is actually better than hiring a bodyguard and relying on others to protect you.</p>
<p>This Shanghai Municipal Hygiene Martial Law Order is certainly not only thinking about summer disease prevention hygiene, but just in terms of its relationship with summer disease prevention hygiene, it can be seen that although the method is "martial law," the essence is a compassionate Bodhisattva heart, which is nothing more than wanting to guide everyone onto the broad road of fighting epidemics and maintaining health. Among the myriad of hygiene regulations, it is a credit to them for coming up with these five simple and easy-to-implement guidelines to serve as the preliminary rules and regulations. I hope everyone will accept them and earnestly implement them!</p>
<h3>Common Sense Questions and Answers About Diseases</h3>

<h3>Ginseng (4)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Xiaohuang</p>
<p>A pottery steamer is added to the pot. The steamer has a diameter of 2.1 feet, a height of 1.8 feet, and a bottom diameter of 1.7 feet. There are many holes in the bottom. Tree branches are placed in the steamer to arrange the ginseng on top, and the lid is closed for steaming. Initially, water is added to the pot, and the heat is gradually increased until it boils. The heat after boiling must be maintained in its original state for one and a half to two hours. At this time, if the boiling soup directly contacts the root, the product will turn dark brown, and its quality will inevitably be inferior. Therefore, a layer of cloth must be added between the pot soup and the rootstock to prevent this. Alternatively, instead of using tree branches, a closed steamer can be used for steaming. When steamed to the appropriate time, it is spread on a mat to cool, and then placed on a roasting stove and dried for four or five days to obtain beautiful red ginseng. Korean ginseng is valued for its redness, while domestically produced Jilin ginseng is the opposite, with white being valued and red being second. Sun-dried ginseng is not processed. The ginseng that has just been unearthed is used, without removing the fibrous roots of the cork skin. It is washed repeatedly to remove dirt. It is tied with a long thread and hung in the air to dry in the sun. It is gray and slightly yellowish.</p>
<h3>Overview of Ginseng Branching and Pricing Rules</h3>
<p>Jilin Liaoning ginseng and Korean ginseng sold in our country are branched up to four branches for ten-branch ginseng, and up to many branches for forty-branch ginseng. Among them, fifteen-branch, twenty-branch, twenty-four-branch, thirty-branch, and forty-branch ginseng are the most common. The fewer the number of branches, the larger the shape of each ginseng, which is the same meaning as the number of slices in Japan. Each type is divided into Heaven, Earth, and other grades. As for the parts cut off from the ginseng, they are collectively called ginseng whiskers. However, people in the ginseng industry further distinguish them into six grades according to their size, such as ginseng strips, large tails, medium tails, side tails, thin tails, and end tails. In recent years, among the Korean ginseng that has arrived in Shanghai, the thin tail and side tail types are the most common. Ningji ginseng is generally divided into two types: cultivated ginseng and wild ginseng. The branching of cultivated ginseng and the naming of ginseng whiskers are all the same as Korean ginseng. However, wild ginseng is scarce and expensive. Except for a few ginseng merchants who cut off the ends and sell them separately, most of them are left in their original state without being separated. Each root weighing five or six taels is considered top grade, three or four taels is medium grade, and one or two taels is second grade. The rest are not valuable. A genuine old mountain six-tael ginseng is worth 2,000 yuan per root, a five-tael ginseng is worth 300 yuan, a one-tael ginseng is worth 150 yuan, a carefully selected ginseng is worth 80 to 18 yuan per tael, ordinary ginseng is worth 30 to 60 yuan, Liaodong prince ginseng is worth 22 to 25 yuan, old mountain transplanted ginseng is worth 10 to 18 yuan, Chongshan wild ginseng is worth 4 to 6 yuan, old planted wild ginseng is worth 2 to 3 yuan, the most common is 2 jiao to 1 yuan, white zhi ginseng whiskers are worth 6 jiao to 2 yuan, red straight ginseng whiskers are worth 6 jiao to 8 jiao, and red and white diced curved ginseng whiskers are about 5 or 6 jiao.</p>
<p>Japanese and Korean white ginseng and red ginseng are also valued for their large size, using names such as twenty slices and thirty slices to distinguish their grades and prices, which refers to the number of pieces per catty. For red ginseng, 50 slices is usually the smallest, and anything smaller than 50 slices is not processed. However, there are many white ginsengs with more than 100 slices.</p>
<h3>Application</h3>
<p>Ginseng is specifically a tonic. It is used for neurasthenia, hysteria, and other general weakness patients. It is also a diuretic. The dosage is one to five grams per dose. It is used as a decoction or as an extract. "Attached" The so-called beard ginseng (ginseng whiskers) in pharmacies is a collection of branch roots and slender parts of the main root, which are dried. Its odor and ingredients are no different from white ginseng. American Ginseng is imported from the United States. It is the root of Panax quinquefolius L (a.gr), produced in the deep forests of eastern North America. The ingredients it contains are the same as those mentioned above. Its application is the same as Jilin ginseng. (End)</p>

<h3>On Re-translation and Others</h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>English and American literature, French literature, and Japanese literature need to be translated directly, and German literature can also be translated directly, it's not absolutely impossible. People who can translate German literature, such as Mr. Yu Dafu and Mr. Lu Xun, also exist to a considerable extent. I feel that only the literature of Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and other small and weak nations is impossible to translate directly, and must be translated indirectly. However, I believe that if possible, major works from Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries should be based on French, and works from Polish-speaking countries should be based on German. When translating indirectly, it is better to base poetry on French and Japanese translations rather than English translations. Because English poetry translation emphasizes meter, while French and Japanese translations emphasize content. We cannot unconditionally say that all books can be translated indirectly, nor can we say that we must wait for direct translations. All questions must be qualified. We must not do things this way or that way without qualifications.</p>
<p>Naturally, direct translation can sometimes be much worse than indirect translation. For example, "My Universities" is said to be a direct translation, but it is said to be inferior to "A Coward" (the product of three translations in English, Japanese, and French), which was translated indirectly. The first sentence of Dr. Zhang Jingsheng's translation of "Confessions" is incorrect, and the first sentence of Mr. Pan Huiwen's translation of "The Crab Cannery Ship" also has a problem. But this cannot be said to be because they translated directly, but because of their knowledge and understanding. If they were to translate indirectly from French or Japanese, they would not necessarily translate well. I believe that before translating a work, the first thing is that the translator must have an understanding and knowledge of the work. We cannot abandon the author's understanding of the work and discuss indirect translation or direct translation alone.</p>
<p>If there is no adequate understanding of a work, it will not work, regardless of whether it is translated directly or indirectly. Knowledge of the work cannot be obtained without research. So, when translating literature, at least some research is required. In this way, direct translation is even more necessary. Moreover, our translation of works is not just to know a little story, but to see their methods of expression in addition to the writer's worldview and outlook on life. For authors like Gide, Jules Romains, Proust, Mayakovsky, and Maeterlinck, indirect translation is dangerous. The original work is difficult to translate, and it is probably more than just a matter of "a hair's breadth away is a thousand miles off." I believe that those who are good at English should translate more American works or translate French works that can only be introduced based on English translations, rather than translating German works. Moreover, the works of Dos Passos, Hemingway, Dreiser, Anderson, and others are more beneficial to China than Gide's works. Gide's works are already not easy to translate directly, and they will definitely not be translated well indirectly.</p>
<p>At present, the literary world needs people to do a lot of translation work. When we translate, we must have flexible methods, but we must not ignore one-time solutions. We naturally have to allow and even demand indirect translation under unavoidable conditions, but we must also prevent inferior goods that hinder the translation of true direct translation. Understanding the work is a prerequisite for translation. The expression style in the work should also be paid attention to. When a "one-time solution" is possible, it is best to think of a "one-time solution." Superficial, comprador-style translation is not allowed.</p>
<p>There are many issues to discuss about translating literature. I hope that faithful writers will publish more opinions. Seeing Mr. Shi Ben's "On Re-translation" made me have to publish the above opinions to clear up his misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Flat Head Theory</h3>
<p>— Xuan Yuan</p>
<p>Chinese people have a very bad habit, which is beheading. Words like "verbal criticism and written attacks" can sometimes demoralize cowards. What is the reason for beheading? Because the neck is too long!</p>
<p>All military men, politicians, writers, and scholars often use a kind of execution-like heroic spirit, whether verbally or in writing. It is not surprising to kill people with a knife; what is strange is a group of people who do not have knives but want to chop off people's heads, or who have the intention but no courage, or who have the courage but no strength, and only try to get everyone to kill those who do not agree with them, trampling them to death, while they themselves do not bear the blame.</p>
<p>As a result, the world is in chaos, and things become complicated. In this chaos, everyone's habit is to lower their heads as much as possible, and to shorten their necks as much as possible. Whoever "sticks out their head" is jointly suppressed, ridiculed, and taken as a deep warning.</p>
<p>Just looking at the recent "mass language" issue, you can see what light is shining in every corner, and what kind of heart is in tension. Is it free development? It violates class character! Is it close to "classical Chinese"? It is a struggle for decline! If you continue to write like this, you are truly a reactionary of the times! In short, it is hateful.</p>
<p>The scope is getting smaller and smaller, so small that there is no place for even a needle tip. Our critics are still complaining: how many angels can stand on it? And the argument is also feverish. Lin Yutang likes "vernacular writing" or "classical vernacular." No, he shouldn't "like" it so much, he should be attacked by the crowd.</p>
<p>In fact, how can this clever but unwilling method work? In ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, people who raise their heads will eventually raise their heads. Some people say that every kind of resistance to the enemy is a hard collar that can support the head and prevent it from going down. Instead, they step over the lowered heads with their heads held high, which is hateful!</p>
<h3>Lost</h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3>Weeding</h3>
<p>— Ren Daquan</p>
<p>The sky was still dark and gloomy, with only a few sparse stars with tiny lights. The rooster had crowed twice, around two o'clock in the morning. Shoubao lazily stretched and yawned, climbed up in one swoop, rubbed his eyes, and asked in a straight voice:</p>
<p>"Mom, is it time to get up?"</p>
<p>"Let me get up and boil water first," Mom answered from the next room. "You sleep a little longer..."</p>
<p>"Oh!" Shoubao turned over and fell back asleep on that broken bed.</p>
<p>Mom was dressing quickly, and coughing repeatedly. Shoubao could no longer sleep, and silently thought in his heart:</p>
<p>The field needs weeding, but the time is really too tight. Today, it was not easy to get Shengfu and Xiaosi to help for a day's work. During the busy season, some meat must be bought anyway. It has been more than half a month since he bought any meat. Buy a little more so Mom can have a piece too. There's also wine, cigarettes, and vegetables, which will cost about a dollar. The wages can only be owed for now. But the field only has four mu and a few fen. Whether the harvest is good or bad, after paying the rent, there will be only two dan of rice left. How can two dan of rice be enough for a year's eating? What if there's a famine...? Thinking of the harvest this year being discounted again, Shoubao couldn't help but stop dumbly, unable to think any further.</p>
<p>In fact, in the spring, the silkworms he relied on all year round took a year. After a month and a half of hard work, the results were not enough to pay back the silkworm capital borrowed from the town at high interest. The mulberry leaves he grew himself had to be eaten for nothing. This major blow made Shoubao, who had no other production, unable to bear it.</p>
<p>"What can I do?" He slammed the edge of the bed violently.</p>
<p>·········</p>
<p>In the darkness, only a vague outline could be seen, and the only sound was the movement of the green seedlings. Wearing that bamboo ring on his head to prevent the seedlings from cutting his face was really uncomfortable.</p>
<p>His knees knelt in the muddy soil, crawling little by little, his hands and arms being used as machines: smearing down the weeds beside the seedlings. Stooping for so long really made his back ache unbearably...</p>
<p>Earlier, Shoubao and the others had been silently working hard, because the amount of weeding was fixed, and no one could do less. If they talked, their hands would slow down, and when the sun rose, the scorching sunlight would shine on their backs, really causing blisters.</p>
<p>Now the sky was already white, and a few strands of red light had been emitted from the distant mountains in the east. The surrounding scenery was gradually becoming clear, and most of his life had already been completed.</p>
<p>"Ah! Let's take a break! Xiaosi." Shengfu stretched and rubbed his knees.</p>
<p>"Life is almost over!" Xiaosi stood up and looked at the field that had already been weeded.</p>
<p>"Hmm! It's time to take a break." Shoubao also stretched.</p>
<p>Dragging his feet full of mud and water, carrying his exhausted body, he sat down on the ridge, and instinctively shouted out: "Ah, it's hard work!"</p>
<p>Shoubao took out the cigarettes he had bought on credit from the town yesterday and gave Shengfu and Xiaosi one each. He lit them with a match and temporarily comfortably watched the wisps of smoke slowly rise.</p>
<p>"Did you clear up the debt with Old Man Yang in town?" Shengfu asked Shoubao as he exhaled smoke.</p>
<p>"How could I not? This is the silkworm capital. If I don't clear it up, what will I do next year? What about you?"</p>
<p>"Me!" Shengfu smiled. "I originally wanted to pay him back and discuss with him, begging him to reduce the interest a little, to not count one month. But he wouldn't reduce it by a single bit, so I simply didn't give it to him. Let's see what he does!"</p>
<p>"Old Man Yang is really too fierce. Even if it's past the middle of the month when you borrow, he still counts a month's interest, and those who borrow from him need to use it urgently, so they have to suffer a bit." Xiaosi also joined in. "And I heard people say that half of his money is also borrowed from the city's money shops, with interest of less than one percent. After just one transaction, and we borrow from him, alas!·········"</p>
<p>"However, Shengfu, it's not right for you not to pay it back at all."</p>
<p>"Reason? To hell with it! If the harvest in the field isn't very good this year, once the money is paid back, then we'll starve!"</p>
<p>Shengfu's words forcefully pierced Shoubao's heart. A wave of disappointment and sorrow lightly assailed him. "Ah!" Two teardrops had quietly hung on his eyelids.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>The sun had risen over the mountains, and the wind was already a bit hot. They quickly continued to work mechanically. But Shoubao seemed to be strangely lacking energy, and was sullen.</p>
<h3>Drizzle and Dusk Again</h3>
<p>— Tied Boat</p>
<p>丨A Record of an Evening in Zhongshan Park After the Rain丨</p>
<p>One day was sweltering, and by afternoon, it was covered with dark clouds again.</p>
<p>By evening, a sparse drizzle began to fall. Drizzle and dusk again—it was poetic enough. The universe was boundless in its stillness, and I felt infinitely light. Fearing to waste a rare dusk in my small room, I invited Xiao He to Zhongshan Park.</p>
<p>Tonight, Zhongshan Park seemed specially prepared for me alone. Usually, it's teeming with people: men, fat or thin, tall or short, with the air of the market or the scholar; modern women with slender waists and bare legs. A drizzle, and all these people had vanished. The world was boundless in its stillness, stillness.</p>
<p>In the silence, even the city's clamor had subsided. Usually, especially at dusk, the asphalt roads outside Zhongshan Park are bustling with traffic, filled with shouts and noise. But now, everything had quieted down. Even when cars drove by or trams ran, the sound was just a brushstroke, like celestial music in the emptiness.</p>
<p>I couldn't tell where it came from, but I heard the sound of a clear chime, followed by two resonant bell tolls. I shivered slightly, as if from cold. Yes, hearing bells on a quiet night brings a chill, especially on a rainy evening when the air is already slightly cold.</p>
<p>Following the swastika-shaped corridor, I walked to the Crane Pond and gazed at the lamplight deep within the green shade of the waterside pavilion opposite. I gasped in amazement. When had I ever appreciated such a breathtaking view? I can't describe how that lamp drew my admiration. I can only tell you its mystery: water flowed beneath the stone foundation, a few new lotus leaves floated on the surface, a small mountain was formed by piles of rocks, and a few trees stood by the mountain, their leaves, neither sparse nor dense, creating a green shade with a lamp within; the rain-washed leaves reflected the lamplight in a tender green, exquisitely verdant, perfectly describing the lush foliage; the lamplight passed through the foliage and reflected on the newly emerging lotus flowers, scattering one or two white water droplets like flowing pearls; from under the lotus leaves came the soft sound of rain, as fish emerged from the water to enjoy this mysterious dusk.</p>
<p>Behind the park is the lotus pond in the ancient cypress grove. We deliberately walked under the ancient cypresses where there was no light, and an indescribable fragrance, carried by wisps of breeze, entered our nostrils. I walked with my head raised—when had I ever walked so confidently? The sky was a deep blue, with a few stars embedded in the blue sea. The night was still, and the sky was still. The stars became the little masters of the still world—I took a few breaths of refreshing air.</p>
<p>Strolling to the pond, I leaned against the railing. Looking with open eyes, I couldn't see anything clearly, only a blur. In the distance, there were some vague shadows. Listening intently, I couldn't hear anything clearly, only the distant sound of rain and sparse bells, and a few splashes of fish jumping in the water. We stood there silently, not saying a word to each other. At that moment, I had no consciousness. Xiao He, he didn't make a sound either. Perhaps he had a different, enticing memory disturbing him?</p>
<p>Late at night, we strolled out of the park, our footsteps following our footsteps, the sound of our steps replacing all our thoughts and words.</p>
<p>Ah, boundless stillness, drizzle and dusk again!</p>
<h3>From Guangzhou to Shanghai (1)</h3>
<p>— Pu Feng</p>
<p>Farewell</p>
<p>Guangzhou is hot! Along with the hot weather, politicians are eager for power, and male and female students, besides being eager for love, are also eager for new literature. But, if you like to make comparisons, you can compare Guangzhou to Shanghai: in Shanghai, almost everyone wants to be a capitalist, while in Guangzhou, the substitute is eagerness for officialdom. Of course, this is just a superficial analogy; in reality, money can work wonders, and the transformation from the God of Wealth to an official is all too easy!</p>
<p>Thank heavens, I finally arrived in this hot Guangzhou!</p>
<p>For the past few days, I've been running around, visiting friends, admiring mountains, and playing in the water. Even though the weather is scorching like fire, it's been easy enough to bear. But, once you've been everywhere and taken care of all the necessary business, being alone in a room, sweating like rain, makes it impossible not to feel depressed.</p>
<p>Because of this, I decided to leave Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Everything was ready when the sky started crying. People say rainy days are for keeping guests, and I was getting anxious. I endured every minute, and as it was almost time to leave, the rain was still drizzling. My mind became confused—but waiting another moment brought clarity, and even the fine drizzle ended. My friends said "How fortunate!" and the two friends who were seeing me off urged me to rush to the train station.</p>
<p>I bought a ticket, found a seat, and ran into an acquaintance. The train was just sighing, not moving. I went back onto the platform to talk about things we'd probably already talked about.</p>
<p>Ding dong! — Woo woo!</p>
<p>The sound of bells came from the station, and the train echoed with several woo woos.</p>
<p>Saying "Goodbye, friend," and shaking hands warmly one last time, I had to get back on the train.</p>
<p>Wipe, wipe—Boom!</p>
<p>The train started moving, my lips still holding the words "Goodbye!"—Back in my seat, a cool breeze came in through the window, my head cleared, and I had this thought: "Hot Guangzhou, farewell for now!"</p>

<h3>[Published every Sunday, Issue 79] Locusts: Pests of the Rice Harvest; Predicting Locust Plagues</h3>
<p>— Tian Ren</p>
<p>Locust plagues and rice-stem borer infestations are important problems for agriculture in our country.</p>
<p>Their danger is like that of tuberculosis or cholera to the human body. Once they break out, they are unstoppable. If some precautions are taken, their damage can be reduced invisibly. However, these kinds of insect plagues do not occur every year, especially locust plagues. The ancients Chen Fang-sheng and Lu Zeng-yu stated that from the Spring and Autumn period to the Ming Dynasty, locust plagues were recorded in historical books 111 times. All the years in which locust plagues raged were called "locust years." From this, it is clear that locust plagues occur at certain times. Although locust plagues occur at certain times, their occurrence varies according to past events. This is generally due to the influence of climate. Because climate is complex, it is not the same every year in every place. Therefore, predicting locust plagues is extremely difficult, but this work is especially necessary.</p>
<p>The waxing and waning of locust plagues depends on climate. Therefore, the climate and its characteristics that influence the large-scale occurrence of locusts must be carefully investigated in order to carry out preliminary prediction work. The occurrence of locust plagues generally has a certain origin area. This area has been known in our country for quite some time. This theory did not wait for the modern locust expert Uvarov to publish his theory of the origin to be known. Xu Guangqi of the Ming Dynasty said in his memorial on eliminating locusts: "Locusts are born on the edge of large swamps, ... in places that suddenly fill and suddenly dry up, such as south of Youzhuo, north of Changhuai, west of Qinggun, and east of Liangsong, where the lakes and marshes are vast and the overflow is irregular, called dry swamps, locusts are born there. According to historical records and what I have seen and heard, most of them are here. If other places are afflicted, they are all extensions, transmitted and born." According to this, the places where insects occur in our country are Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shaanxi, Hubei, Sichuan, and Liaoning provinces. In other words, their distribution range is almost all over central and northern China. Since the area is large, the climate is naturally different. In predicting locust plagues, if accurate conclusions are required, a close meteorological monitoring system must be in place in these areas. However, this requirement cannot be met in our country today. Therefore, the so-called locust plague prediction is a very rough and preliminary estimate, using the eyes of nature to describe the general situation in general terms.</p>
<p>The first person to pay attention to locust plague prediction was Swinton (1833). He compared the tables of locust occurrence in various countries with the waxing and waning of sunspots. The large-scale occurrence of locusts in Europe and Africa generally coincided with the appearance of small sunspots. Krassilschik (1893) studied the migratory locust Locustamigratoria and established the theory of "Laolcustperiodicity," saying that migratory locusts occur every 12 years at the mouth of the Danube and every five or six years in the Caucasus. Recently, Kujagin (1921) used the same historical statistical method to study the large-scale occurrence of locusts in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries to prepare for future locust plague predictions. But the result was negative. Recently, Uvarov (1931) criticized the cause of the error, saying that it was due to the error in the method. These scholars mostly used the past periodic phenomena found under a certain climate for a certain type of locust, without analyzing the reasons for its non-occurrence, and applied it to various types with different growth patterns to predict its future occurrence, which is practically impossible.</p>
<p>According to Simroth (1008-1909), the periodicity of climate is due to sunspots every 11 years. Therefore, the change in the number of most animals (including insects) is also caused by this relationship. Later scholars also discussed this issue. For example, the butterfly ColiasCroceus is produced in southern Europe, but it can also occur in northern Europe in certain years. This year of occurrence is generally once every 11 years. The occurrence of the death's-head hawkmoth Acherontiaatropos also has the same phenomenon. But Meisoner (4909) and Schuster (1909) opposed Simroth's sunspot theory. Gatow (1925) investigated the occurrence of Tortixviridana for about 200 years. The period of its waxing and waning is roughly the same as the 17-year period of warm and cold climate changes. Also, although the large-scale occurrence of this insect does not fully coincide with the warm period, the general trend is to take this period as the center of occurrence. Uvarov (1931) said that the large-scale breeding of the desert locust Schistoceroagregaria from Morocco and Senegal to Kenya, Egypt, Palestine, Persia, and northern India was at a low point in 1915-1916. Recently, since 1917, it has begun to rage on a large scale again. It has not been eliminated by 1930. The interval between the rest periods is about 11 years. It is even more worth mentioning that when the desert locust was rampant in the Arabian region in 1917, our country's migratory locust Locustamigratotia was also rampant. Although the regions were far apart and the species were different, the rampant phenomenon was the same. From this, it can be seen that there must be a common relationship in nature; this common relationship affects the general organisms on the earth. However, this common relationship, other than sunspots, lacks a perfect answer.</p>
<p>Statistics from past events show that the large-scale occurrence of various locusts in various places, although there is a periodic phenomenon, lacks a fixed period of change. In other words, the change of this periodicity is more accurate to say that it is irregular than to say that it is regular. The investigation of the inducing factors of this irregular locust plague is the basic work for locust plague prediction. These factors can be divided into biological and non-biological factors. The so-called biological factors refer to the influence of parasitic or predatory organisms of locusts. Non-biological factors refer to climate and various physiological and ecological changes caused by climate. According to recent research, the main relationship of the large-scale occurrence of migratory locusts is due to the influence of non-biological factors, which should be paid attention to when predicting.</p>
<p>In the growth of various organisms, the relationship with climate has an inherent optimal state. This optimal state is specifically called "Vitaloptimum." The climate felt by organisms in their growth, depending on whether it reaches the optimal state of life, not only affects the morphology of organisms, but also can produce great differences in physiology. According to Uvarov's (1921) research, the same species of locust, due to the different location and time of egg-laying, those who can obtain the most appropriate climate will become the migratory locust type, otherwise they will be transformed into the solitary grasshopper type. However, climate is not only different due to the influence of nature such as sunspots, but also varies from region to year. The year when migratory locusts occur is therefore periodic, but lacks a unified schedule. Filipjev recently investigated the years of large-scale occurrence of Russian migratory locusts 1921-1924, which was caused by the influence of drought and hot climate. The same fact was also seen in 1891. In addition, locust plagues caused by hot and dry climate are also seen in Keppen (1870). He said, "If the climate is appropriate during the autumn when locusts mate and lay eggs, the period of these activities can be extended, so the number of eggs laid must be more than in a cold and humid autumn." Although there is no practical evidence to prove this situation in locusts, there are many examples in other insects. We firmly believe that an appropriate climate can extend the possible egg-laying period of locusts, continue to develop their ovaries and eggs, and increase the number of eggs laid. Parker (1929, 1930) studied the relationship between the American grasshopper Melanoplusmexicanus and climate, and found that dry food can cause a kind of deformation, which is similar to Spretus, Walsh, which is proposed as the migratory type of this species. He also used a diagram to show the large-scale occurrence of this grasshopper, saying that after every three or four consecutive dry years, there is a period of rampancy.</p>
<p>Ancient records of locusts in our country are quite detailed. Regarding the aspect of fecundity, the most noteworthy are severe drought and winter snow. According to Xu Guodong's investigation of the section on locust pests in the records of Zhejiang County, the earliest record of locust plagues in Zhejiang was in the second year of Taihing in the Jin Dynasty (319 AD) to the second year of Yongding in the Chen Dynasty (558 AD). There were records of drought and locusts. After that, whenever there were drought and locusts eating rice fields; drought in western Zhejiang, large locusts covering the sky like smoke; long drought and large locusts; drought and plague and large locusts; severe drought and large locusts in western Zhejiang; severe drought and locusts in Jiangsu and Zhejiang; severe drought and locust famine; autumn drought and locusts; drought and locusts covering the sun; locusts, drought and plague; drought and locusts in July; locusts flying and covering the sky; years of drought and famine; severe drought in summer; no rain in March, locusts flying and covering the sky on May 28; summer drought, autumn locusts, etc., records are endless. In summary, where there are locusts, there must be drought, and summer drought is the most common phenomenon. According to recent locust plagues in our country, drought years are also common, so it can be known that drought is the main condition for the occurrence of migratory locusts. This has long been known in the history of our country. If we compare the climate with locust plagues over the years, it is easier to discover this relationship. Now, taking the Jiangzhe area of our country as an example, we know that the recent rampant years of locust plagues were the 16th, 17th, and 18th years of the Republic of China. Migratory locusts have been harmful to the north and south of the Yangtze River, and spread to the western Zhejiang area. The locust plague situation last year (22nd year) was also almost the same. In addition, in the 11th year of the Republic of China, a small number of locusts were discovered in Nantong. According to the climate measured at Hangzhou Jianqiao since the 8th year of the Republic of China, and calculating the rainfall in May, June, and July, which are the most important for locust growth, (see chart) it was found that the average rainfall in these three months is about 500mm. In dry years, if the rainfall is less than this number, it is a sign of locust plague. This influence can affect the locust plague in the same year, or can affect the locust plague in the following one or two years. Last year, the rainfall in May, June, and July was only about 400mm, so the locust plague last year was not considered mild. Although the total rainfall for these three months this year has not yet been counted, judging from the past May and June, it is indeed a sign of severe drought. In addition, due to the influence of the locust plague last year, the locust plague this year is very worrying. This is why the Ministry of Industry convened a seven-province locust control meeting. As of now, the reports of locusts in various places are countless, which is enough to prove the coming of a major disaster, and it is necessary to prepare early and take precautions.</p>
<p>The above picture shows the relationship between the rainfall in May, June, and July of each year from the 8th year of the Republic of China to the 22nd year of the Republic of China in Hangzhou Jianqiao and the occurrence of locust plagues. The winter climate also has a considerable impact on the occurrence of locust plagues. In particular, the presence or absence of winter snow has long been noticed by our ancestors. It was once seen in Gu Yan's Complete Record of Locust Control: Because there was no snow in winter, it was predicted that locust plagues were inevitable, so he wrote books and printed leaflets to widely promote the method of locust control, so the locust plague was reduced, so he called himself the Master of the White Snow Studio. It can also be seen that the ancients attached importance to winter snow and used it as the basis for predicting locust plagues. However, according to the actual situation, the relationship between winter climate and insect plague varies greatly depending on the insect. For example, for pests such as rice stem borers, which overwinter with larvae that are weaker in resisting climate, the low temperature in winter has a great impact on their occurrence. However, locusts overwinter with egg masses containing extremely thick wax, which are laid in the soil. They have considerable resistance to the winter climate. If there is no extreme cold, the impact on the death of eggs is minimal. Therefore, predicting the occurrence of locust plagues, it is better to focus on summer dry high temperature as the standard. According to the experience of the past ten years, locust plagues in Jiangzhe mostly occur in the year following a warm and dry winter, but not every year following a warm and dry winter is necessarily a year of locust plague.</p>
<h3>Locust and Grasshopper Prevention Methods</h3>
<p>— Announcement Time</p>
<p>Locust plagues in China have a long history, repeatedly mentioned in ancient texts. The Book of Songs says, "The locusts' wings, so numerous! May your children and grandchildren thrive!" It also says, "Remove the rice-eating insects, and the grain-devouring pests, do not harm my young crops. The god of the fields holds the blazing torch." "Locust" is the general term for locusts and grasshoppers. "Teng" is a specific name within that category. These are the earliest references to locusts in ancient books. It is said that in the fifteenth year of Duke Xuan, in winter, "yuan" were born. "Yuan" may refer to locusts that have not yet grown wings. "Nantou" is another name for the same thing. Due to the influence of the First Emperor of Qin's burning of books and burying of scholars alive, there are no records of locust control during the Qin Dynasty. Since Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, there has been constant warfare, attacking the Xiongnu, pacifying Nanyue, conquering the Western Yi, and fighting the Huns. There was no peace throughout the year. Many people abandoned farming to join the army. From summer to autumn, locust plagues often spread throughout the country. Descending to the Tang Dynasty, locust plagues were a constant historical problem. Their extent was no less severe than during the Qin and Han dynasties, but detailed prevention methods were not recorded. Only in the fourth year of the Kaiyuan era was there a major locust plague in Shandong. Yao Chong requested that officials be sent to various areas to capture and bury the locusts. This method was widely adopted at the time. That year, the responsible officials reported that over one million "dan" (a unit of weight) of locusts had been captured, an astonishing number, suggesting the forceful efforts exerted at the time. During the Five Dynasties period, in the late Tianfu era of the Later Jin Dynasty, there was a major locust plague across the country, persisting for years. The government ordered the people to capture one "dou" (a unit of volume) of locusts and compensated them with one "dou" of grain. In addition, the Hezhou Chronicle mentions locusts in the first year of the Tianxi era of the Song Dynasty, and the Gaoyou Chronicle mentions locusts in the second year of the Qingyuan era of the Song Ningzong Dynasty. During the Chunxi era of the Song Dynasty, there was an imperial edict stating that if local neighbors concealed the initial hatching or landing of locusts and did not immediately report and eliminate them, they would be punished with one hundred strokes of the cane. Officials who falsely reported that the locusts were completely eradicated, but allowed them to hatch the following year, would also be punished with strokes of the cane, indicating the severity of the locust plague. As for private records, they are too numerous to mention, but unfortunately, they are often fictional, making them unreliable. For example, the Chengwu County Chronicle states, "In the 45th year of the Wanli era of the Ming Dynasty, there was a severe drought, and locusts obscured the sky. Capturing locusts was allowed as a substitute for labor service." The Dingxing County Chronicle states, "In the Renzi year of the Chongzhen era, there were major locust plagues in Shandong and Henan provinces." Other accounts are even more fantastical. However, Xu Guangqi's memorial on eliminating locusts is very detailed. While his theories may not entirely align with modern scientific principles, they hold significant value in the history of locust control. It is recorded that in the Renzi year of the eleventh year of the Kangxi era of the Qing Dynasty, locusts did not become a large problem. On May 8th of a certain year in the Xianfeng era, locusts covered the fields in Tongcheng. The people considered them divine and warned each other not to offend them, only praying for deliverance. Yin Gaoyi, the then-incumbent patrol inspector, witnessed this situation and felt deeply saddened. He then published a book on essential locust control methods, explaining them to the people. Although the methods were limited to a specific area, they were not without some benefit. In recent years, the advancement of entomology has far surpassed that of the past. The methods of pest control researched by various countries have been constantly evolving. Locusts are a major enemy of agriculture. When the plague is severe, crops can be completely destroyed, and farmers lose their livelihood. This is something that the government authorities should pay close attention to. The simple prevention methods are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Reclaim Wasteland: Those with basic entomological knowledge generally know that locusts often originate in wasteland. Therefore, to eliminate locust plagues, one must start with reclaiming wasteland. For example, the Rocky Mountains in the United States were once barren and plagued by locusts almost every year. After reclamation, they were no longer a problem. The area of wasteland in our country ranks first in the world. It is our sincere hope that the government, while advocating for rural revitalization, will also consider this practical policy, comprehensively plan the country's wasteland, and implement a military reclamation system, so that those who previously relied on the people for support can become self-sufficient. As for sparse areas that are not suitable for crop cultivation, the government should cultivate saplings and implement afforestation on a large scale. Even if it cannot be completed in one year, it can be promoted year by year. The goal should be to have no wasteland within the country and no unemployed people within its borders. The benefits will not be lightly abandoned in the fields, and locusts can be eliminated invisibly.</p>
<p>(2) Dig Up Eggs: Digging up eggs is one of the important ancient Chinese methods for controlling locusts. Local officials often forced the people to carry it out. Areas where the topsoil is raised and has many small holes often contain locust eggs. This method is still used in Spain, South Africa, and other places. The dug-up eggs can be used as feed for chickens and ducks, but the drawback is that it is labor-intensive and yields little results.</p>
<p>(3) Drive Ducks to Peck and Eat: Using ducks to peck and eat hoppers is very convenient. According to experimental results, each duck can eat about two pounds of hoppers per day. However, when ducks are pecking, they must be provided with sufficient clean water, otherwise they are prone to overeating and dying. Therefore, using ducks to control hoppers in areas near water sources not only eliminates locust plagues, but also makes it easier for ducks to grow fat, which is truly a win-win situation.</p>
<p>(4) Dig Ditches: Digging ditches to drive locusts is a common method used in various provinces of our country. It was invented by Yao Chong, a prime minister of the Tang Dynasty. It is still used in India, South America, Madagascar, Bulgaria, Romania, and the Belgian Congo. The width and depth of the ditch depend on the age and number of locusts. According to the reporter's experimental results, the average jumping distance of the first-instar hoppers is nine inches. The second-instar is fourteen inches. The third-instar is twenty-two inches. The fourth-instar is twenty-six inches. The fifth-instar is twenty-nine and a half inches. The depth of the ditch should be based on this. The depth of the ditch varies depending on the number of hoppers. When there are many, it can be about three feet deep, but usually one or two feet is sufficient. The perimeter of the ditch should be at right angles. If the soil is firm, it can be dug into an acute angle, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom, which will be more effective. The four walls of the ditch should be smooth so that the hoppers cannot jump over. Every one or two "zhang" (a unit of length), dig a smaller ditch. Pile the dug-up soil on the side towards which the locusts are moving. The entire ditch should be directly facing the direction of the locusts' advance. After the ditch is completed, the locust-driving people should line up and proceed slowly in the direction of the locusts, using brooms or branches to drive the hoppers into the ditch. After the smaller ditch is filled, bury them with soil.</p>
<p>(5) Spray Kerosene on the Water Surface: This method was invented by the former Jiangsu Provincial Entomology Bureau. It is now used in many places. It involves spraying a very thin layer of kerosene on the surface of the water when hoppers pass through small rivers or ditches. This causes the hoppers to suffocate and die after crossing the water, which is very effective.</p>
<p>(6) Beating: Beating is also one of the ancient Chinese methods of controlling locusts. It has also been used in Argentina, South Africa, and other places. Before beating, it is necessary to determine the concentration points of the hoppers. All personnel should surround the hopper swarm and beat them with brooms as they move. However, this is too labor-intensive and not very economical.</p>
<p>(7) Net Catching: In the early morning, at night, or on cloudy days, hoppers gather on the grass and move very slowly. They can be caught with a locust-catching bag. The bag is made of cloth and has a small bag attached to the bottom. The small and large bags are connected by a neck, allowing insects to enter but not exit. To use it, hold the handle about three-quarters of the way down with your right hand, and grasp the end with your left hand. Walk across the grass, moving the handle to the left with your right hand, so that the bag sweeps over the grass. Then, move it to the right. The bag will naturally move to the right due to air resistance. Continue sweeping and advancing until you reach the other end of the locust-infested area. Then, change to another row. After the small bag is filled with hoppers, take them out and kill them. These dead locusts can be used as crop fertilizer and livestock feed.</p>
<p>(8) Rolling: This method was invented by Mr. Yang Weiyi, the former Director of the Jiangxi Entomology Bureau. It involves using two horses to pull a locust-catching roller. People can also be used to replace the horses. When the hoppers are disturbed, they jump onto the roller. The relative rotation of the wooden sticks then crushes the hoppers to death. This method is quite effective on flat ground.</p>
<p>(9) Poison Bait: Poison bait is made by mixing poison, attractants, and poison carriers. However, many entomologists now believe that attractants do not increase the effectiveness of poison bait in killing locusts and advocate removing them. There are three methods of scattering: 1. Scattering directly by hand; 2. Scattering with a bait spreader; 3. Scattering by airplane (Russia). There are many formulas for poison bait. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>(1) Jiangsu Provincial Entomology Bureau Formula of 1930: Arsenic trioxide 1 part, brown sugar 1 part, wheat bran 30 parts, water 25-30 parts.</p>
<p>(2) Iraq Formula of 1927: Wheat bran 15 parts, sodium arsenite 1 part, honey 2 parts.</p>

<p>(6) French Sudan Formula of 1932: Sawdust or (peanut shells) 50 pounds, cow dung 50 pounds, honey 8 pounds, sodium arsenite 4 pounds.</p>
<p>(7) Algeria Formula of 1930: Sodium arsenite 4-5 pounds, wheat bran 100-120 pounds, honey 10 pounds.</p>

<h3>Review of the Locust Plague | Year 22 of the Republic of China | Nai Gong</h3>
<p>Locusts darken the sky, depriving it of color; old farmers in the fields shed tears of blood. They pull at their clothes and stamp their feet, unable to catch them; large leaves are completely eaten, and small branches are broken. Last year, they were in arrears for taxes. Who can they ask for this year's levy? The officials are drunk and asleep, paying no attention. With a sigh, they turn their heads and gaze towards the capital. This is a poem about locusts by Guo Dunfei. Anyone with a heart who reads it cannot help but shed tears of sorrow. Once a locust plague occurs, farmers suffer double losses. On one hand, their own crop production decreases; on the other hand, corrupt officials make excessive demands. "Locusts in official robes" are often less effective than the ordinary locusts. What is past is past, but the future can be pursued. In the future, we only hope that the government will make comprehensive plans for the locust plague problem nationwide, and use political power and scientific methods to strive for a thorough solution. Otherwise, it will be a case of "treating the head when it hurts, and treating the foot when it hurts," and the locust plague will never be eradicated. Anyone with basic entomological knowledge knows this. Furthermore, the occurrence of locust plagues is greatly affected by the climate. This year's drought is already a reality. It is feared that the locust plagues in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces will be difficult to avoid. If there are no drastic changes in the climate in the future, their severity will be no less than in the 18th year of the Republic of China. The occurrence of locust plagues last year is briefly described below for reference.</p>
<p>1. Affected Areas</p>
<p>The areas affected by locust plagues last year were extremely vast. According to verifiable reports from various sources, there were a total of ten provinces and 231 counties. They extended north to Jin County (Liaoning), south to Anhua (Hunan), east to Nanhui (Jiangsu), and west to Ji County (Shaanxi), covering an area from 28 to 41 degrees north latitude and 107 to 121.5 degrees east longitude. The extent of the locust infestation is evident. In terms of the distribution center, the areas around Dongting Lake, Chaohu Lake, Taihu Lake, Weishan Lake, Hongze Lake, Dongping Lake, Baoying Lake, Wohu Lake, Luoma Lake, Gaoyou Lake, Donghu Lake, West Lake (Anhui), Dushan Lake, the Huai River, the Wei River, the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, the Yongding River, the Grand Canal, the coastal tidal flats of eastern Jiangsu Province, and both banks of the Qiantang River estuary were almost entirely affected. The important counties where locusts occurred last year are listed in the table below.</p>
<h3>Province County</h3>

<p>Liaoning Province: Jin County, Xingcheng, etc., totaling 2 counties.</p>
<p>2. Time of Occurrence</p>
<p>The locust plagues in the aforementioned 231 counties occurred at different times. Some had summer locusts but no autumn locusts, some had autumn locusts but no summer locusts, and some had both summer and autumn locusts. The time of discovery also varied depending on the environment. The summer locusts last year were discovered from early April to late August, with June being the peak. The autumn locusts were discovered from mid-June to mid-October, with August being the peak. The time of occurrence of the locust plagues last year is listed in the table below.</p>
<p>First Generation Locusts (Summer Locusts) Second Generation Locusts (Autumn Locusts)</p>
<p>Time of Occurrence Number of Affected Counties Time of Occurrence Number of Affected Counties</p>
<p>Early April 1 Mid-June 3</p>
<p>Mid-April 5 Late June 6</p>
<p>Late April 8 Early July 11</p>
<p>Early May 15 Mid-July 12</p>
<p>Mid-May 27 Late July 16</p>
<p>Late May 8 Early August 23</p>
<p>Early June 11 Mid-August 19</p>
<p>Mid-June 14 Late August 7</p>
<p>Late June 12 Early September 5</p>
<p>Early July 21 Mid-September 4</p>
<p>Mid-July 16 Late September 2</p>
<p>Late July 7 Early October 3</p>
<p>Early August 3 Mid-October 1</p>
<p>Mid-August 2</p>
<p>Late August 1</p>
<p>3. Plants Affected</p>
<p>Locusts are polyphagous insects. In China, rice, sorghum, corn, and reeds are the most severely affected. Cotton, soybeans, sweet potatoes, etc., are also often affected. Wu Zunlu's claim that locusts do not eat soybean seedlings is not credible. The types of plants eaten by locusts last year are listed in the table below.</p>
<h3>Province Types of Plants Affected</h3>
<p>Hebei: Wheat, sorghum, millet, corn, rice, reeds. Shandong: Wheat, sorghum, millet, corn, rice, reeds. Anhui: Wheat, sorghum, millet, corn, rice, rice, soybeans, cotton, reeds. Henan: Wheat, sorghum, millet, corn, rice, sweet potatoes, reeds. Jiangsu: Wheat, sorghum, millet, sweet potatoes, rice, cotton, bamboo, peanuts, soybeans, reeds. Shaanxi: Wheat, corn, sorghum, rice.</p>
<p>Shanxi: Corn, sorghum, millet, rice.</p>
<p>Zhejiang: Rice, corn, bamboo, soybeans, reeds.</p>
<p>Hunan: Wheat, corn, sorghum, bamboo, reeds.</p>
<p>Liaoning: Wheat, corn, millet, sorghum.</p>
<p>4. Loss Statistics</p>
<p>There have never been accurate statistics on the losses from locust plagues in China. It was not until the 18th year of the Republic of China that Mr. Chen Jiaxiang, a technician at the Jiangsu Provincial Entomology Bureau, conducted a detailed survey. According to him, the total loss from the locust plagues that year was 110,265,006 yuan. The situation was most serious in Hebei, Shandong, and Anhui provinces, followed by Jiangsu and Henan, and then Hubei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Shanxi, Zhejiang, and Liaoning. Last summer, the water level of the Yellow River was higher, and the locust plagues were not as severe as in the 18th year of the Republic of China. However, the affected area still reached about 18 million mu (a unit of area), and the total loss nationwide was about 20 million yuan. The loss figures for this year are likely to increase. It is hoped that the government will take urgent action.</p>
<h3>Commercial News Finance The Banks are Closed for the Holiday, Receipts and Payments Suspended; The Call Loan Market is Stagnant and the Price of Fractional Silver Coins Surges.</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the date for the banks' semi-annual settlement. As usual, they were closed for the holiday, so receipts and payments were completely suspended. The call loan market was also quite sluggish. Both the morning and afternoon markets remained at 0.5%, with no changes from the previous day. Transactions of call money were also quieter than usual. The total turnover in the morning market for transfers and new transactions was slightly over 3.1 million, 300,000 in the afternoon market and 400,000 from the Small Bills Association, 300,000 in pledged dollars were taken out but no new deals were made. Silver dollar receipts and payments at money shops exceeded 3.1 million, and inward remittances were slightly over 200,000. The market for fractional silver coins improved significantly. Small silver coins from Jiangsu traded in the morning market for 828 dollars, up 3 dollars from the previous day. By the close of the afternoon market, it had risen another 17 dollars, resulting in a gain of 20 dollars from the morning market, which is rare. Transactions reached 1,000 fractional coins in the morning market and 6,000 in the afternoon market. Small silver coins from Guangdong opened at 730.5 dollars in the morning market and increased by 3.5 dollars to 734 dollars in the afternoon market, resulting in a gain of 3.5 dollars from the previous day. Transactions reached 60,000 fractional coins in the morning market and 90,000 in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained stagnant at 332,500 cash, the same as the previous day, with a transaction value of 8,200 silver dollars, equivalent to 27,265 strings of cash.</p>
