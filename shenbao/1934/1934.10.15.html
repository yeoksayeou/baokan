<p>孔祥熙宣稱對此表示感謝</p>
<p>（南京）　中央與美國政府磋商之後、已將最近國民政府與美國政府之換文發表、財政部長孔祥熙於發表此項換文之時宣稱、彼對於美國當局願於白銀購買法之範圍以内、盡量顧及中國政府所提出之意見、並願與中國代表共同考慮其他比較重要之問題、表示感謝、兹將換文内容摘録如下、</p>
<p>一九三四年九月二十三日中國駐美公使施肇基致送美國政府之照會云、中國處於主要銀本位國家之地位、以爲白銀對於中國之關係、較之任何他國更爲切要、兹以美國實施白銀購買法、故再補充以前非正式照會之意見、查自一九三一年起、銀價因外幣减值而致上升、中國已不得不作嚴重之膨脹而受經濟上之損失、且中國之對外收支、至少一部份因輸出受碍、亦越出常軌、近來國外銀價大受刺激、然匯兌方面未有相當響應、以致白銀巨量流出、令人震驚、本年白銀出口、至今日爲止、已三倍於以前每年總額之數、若銀價再行高漲、則中國將受極大之損害、或有發生恐慌之可能、故美國有勢力各方、雖主張銀價提高、中國政府固不能與美國政策同一見地也、中國確知美國政府甚欲免避使現在情形增加困難之行動、故願得一言保證、卽美國政府不取可使中國白銀再有流出之行動、並與中國各方、雖主張銀價提高、中國政府固不能與美國政策同一見地也、中國確知美國政府甚欲免避使現在情形增加困難之行動、故願得一言保證、卽美國政府不取可使中國白銀再有流出之行動、並與中國合作、依照倫敦銀恊定之原意、阻止銀價高漲、而維持平衡、以中國之意見、白銀之穏定價格、尙應較目前之價格稍低也、中國政府以責任所在、必須設法避免銀價變動之損害、現在以爲中國不應單獨維持銀本位制度、故已考慮逐漸採用金本位貨幣、因此必須吸收現金、兹美國政府旣欲增加國庫現銀準備之比數、中國政府亦願確知美國政府在原則上是否願與中國政府作金銀相互之交換、</p>
<p>「一九三四年十月十二日美國政府致中國政府之覆文云、九月二十二日之覆文、未能準時送達、殊爲歉仄、鄙人已與中國駐美公使談話、詳細解釋敝國政府對於中國二次照會之態度、鄙人於談話之時、設法表示敝國政府購買白銀計劃之初衷、該項計劃係國會議定、命令政府依照執行、至於執行時所取方法、則政府有便宜之權、惟須遵照該項計劃之目標進行、敝國政府甚願於實行該項計劃之時、使有普遍之利益、結果可使銀價穏定、而盡量避免對於中國之經濟及公共財政、發生擾亂、故敝國政府一方面固須執行國會法令、一方面亦竭力注意中國政府之意見、而調整購銀之時間地點以及數量、現在購買金銀、各國皆可公開之市塲進行、故政府間之直接交易未曾實行、惟將來儘可舉行友好之討論、况兩國現方有共同之願望、以達共同之制度、故敝國甚願隨時與貴國代表、討論此等較大之問題也（十四日國民電）</p>

<p>— 季</p>
<p>我國社會。向有一種傳統的病態現象。即人民之受高深敎育者。恒染昔日士大夫習氣。甚至四體不勤。五榖不分。反之胼手胝足。從事生産之農工。則又類爲未受敎育之人民。在昔科舉時代。固係若斯。科舉廢而學校代興。仍復不改。言其影響。實至重大。過去敎育之功效。僅就顯示於國計民生者而論。直等於零。第二十世紀之生活。究不可與十五六世紀之生活相比觀。而號稱現代之國家。尤不可藉舊式之生産法而苟存。是以積時愈久。危機愈顯。我國今日國難臨頭。百廢待舉。人心彷徨。莫知適從。實則癥結所在。不難窺見。蓋仍不外夫敎育未上正軌而已。年來生産敎育之呼聲。甚囂塵上。顧「足以充實國計民生。清内亂而禦外侮」之生産建設精神。表現於敎育者。仍不多覩。一般學子經傳統的習氣之薰陶。不期然而成爲昔日之士大夫者流。然除少數之幸運兒外。求官固乏門路。就業更鮮技能。畢業卽失業之現象。已暴露於全國而重增國家社會之累。</p>
<p>國内有識人士。有感於此。遂羣起而歸咎於過去敎育之錯誤。相與倡議。今後之敎育。應以生産爲準繩。敎育當局。亦開始注重於理工等實科之添置及擴充。而裁减文法。以爲調劑。其意固謂。青年學生。苟能學得生産技能。將來一出校門。必爲我國「百業待興。百廢待舉」之社會所需要。此在青年個人。固可獲得服務機會之保障。而於整個的國計民生。裨益亦多。惟以吾人之愚。則覺事實未必如此。我國社會「百業待興。百廢待舉。」固爲不可否認之事實。然在事業未興未舉以前。將何以容納多數具有新式生産技能之青年乎。苟今後改革敎育者。僅知致力於青年生産技能之養成。而不問技能養成以後之人才安插問題。結果亦惟造成多數高級的失業流氓而已。如青年學子在學業大成後。仍不能免於流離失所。則吾人所期待於生産敎育以補救國計民生者。亦何謂耶。不觀乎一般學理工科之留學生。歸國以後。不獲一進實業界而展其所長。且有入學校充敎師匠以糊其口者。殷鑒不遠。吾人應有所炯戒。</p>
<p>是以我國今日敎育上之最切要問題。不僅爲學生在求學時有無獲得生産知識之機會。且爲學生在畢業後能否實用其所得之學識。以其自力開闢新天地。換言之我國今後辦敎育之最高目標。宜爲精明强幹獨立創業之人才之造就。而不可僅以養成學生之生産技能爲已足。誠能如是。則青年離校後。不惟不致因社會事業之缺乏而起恐慌。並能自動的創業造業。推動社會進化之巨輪。</p>
<p>此事大難。無庸諱言。然有一消極而必要的先决條件。爲吾人今日可以努力而求貫澈者。則不容不儘先實行。此即打破傳統的士大夫習氣是也。此種習氣而能行破。則學生之腦海中。根本無倚賴舊環境以求富貴榮華之齷齪思想。一方不願受惡勢力之卵翼。一方又不勝舊環境之壓迫。窮極智生。則必能突圍而出。自闢蹊徑。今後學生誠能保持農工階級適應舊環境之美德。而又濟之以反抗舊環境之勇氣與學識。則獨立創業之人才可輩出矣。負有改革敎育之使命與宏願者。其先以身作則打破數千年來泄泄沓沓之士大夫習氣可乎。跂予望之矣。</p>

<p>（東京）　關於改革駐滿機關問題、乃以憲兵司令官兼任警務部長案爲中心、成爲現塲之糾紛、與中央部爭持不下、陸軍與拓務兩省各發聲明雙方起釁已甚明顯、政府業於十二日閣議席上指示、該問題之解决須待現塲之菱刈長官設法鎭撫、在未接到該長官之報告以前、當採取靜觀態度、但雖經閣議商榷在案、而陸軍當局則以政府首腦部態度和緩爲不當、復於十三日發表聲明、林陸相並擬於一兩日内與首相會見、極少希望將閣議决定之駐滿機關改革案從迅促其實現、至與陸軍處於對立地位之拓務省、雖經岡田兼拓相訓令、而對於陸軍之聲明亦斷難默默無言、故决於十四日發出反駁之聲明、於是陸軍與拓務兩省當局完全處於抗爭狀態矣、岡田首相認爲此種情形、實爲暴露内閣不統一、有失政府威信、對於政界之影響至爲重大、現將决計出而裁决、各方面均對此案極形注目云、（十四日日聯電）</p>

<p>軍備比較落後　財政困難所限</p>
<p>英國是比較保守的、同時又是比較能够冷靜的國民、她不大十分趕時髦、特别是國際政治上、她總保持着紳士態度、但也决不落後、待到相當的時候、必須動手時、她立即動手、例如最近歡洲爲軍備問題爭執得非常利害、德國因此退出國聯、法國則以全力保障安全、日本用國庫百分之五十的歲出作軍費、美國預備建造一百艘以上的軍艦、英國却老没有什麽驚人的計劃、好像不熱心於軍備似的、但到最近形勢却變了、歐洲的危機越見緊急、軍事的需要也更加迫切、英國奮然而起、要擴張空軍、并增進陸軍的機械化、據航空部所發表的數字、英國空軍居世界第五位、第一是法國、（其第一綫飛機有一千六百架）第二是蘇聯、（第一綫的大約有一千三百到一千五百架）第三是美國、第四是意大利、（各有一千一百架左右）英國祇有八百五十架、所以今後（自一九三四年起）五年之内、要擴張七十七個飛行中隊、每一中隊包含一架發動機的飛機十二架、或兩座發動機的飛機十架到十二架、如爲飛艇則每中隊祇有四架、共計新飛機有八百四十架、</p>
<p>至於擴張空軍計劃的經濟、據代理内閣總理保守黨領袖鮑爾温的說明是、「大戰以來、我國積極的繼續努力於追求國際軍縮政策、因爲要促進該項政策、自行示範起見、所以將我們自己的軍備、縮小到僅足以抵禦危險的程度、這就是期待各國也以我爲先例、殊不知軍縮會議之遷延、竟出乎我們意想以外、過去八年半（自一九二六年起）我國國防力、缺陷累積、各方面議論頻頻、高呌出國境不安、特别是各國軍費支出增加、勢力均衡成了問題、所以現在我們不但要彌補空軍的缺點、并且還有將延滯了好幾次的擴張空軍計劃重立起來的必要、我們該决心認定這是不可一日遲延的了、其擴張的方法、是最近幾年間把我們的空軍力、擴張到接近於最近隣國的水準……、」</p>
<p>由最後一句話、好像是指法國作她的假想敵、但其後補足的語句、又是注意德國方面、鮑爾温氏又講道、「到了空防時代、我們必須注意、舊時的國境都消失其作用了、諸君想到護衛英國的時候、再不能考慮到在多佛（Dover）的斷崖絕壁間的防備、要注意到今日國境、必擴展至萊茵河岸了、」</p>
<p>當擴張空軍計劃案提出來的時候、工黨上院議員旁松畢卽倡言反對、他以爲「軍縮會議剛剛終了、法外長巴爾都又纔到過倫敦、如果就提出擴張軍備案、這種政策不但不能保障安全、反而與世界和平有害、甚至引起軍備競爭、所以爲此表示遺憾之意……、」他又以爲對法的軍備均衡全無意義、而且在所謂英法諒解之後、豈不會惹起國民的懷疑、但是結果、旁松畢氏的提案被五十四對九的多數所否决了、即是空軍擴張計劃在上院通過、要轉到衆議院去、</p>
<p>在衆議院中最主要的非難是自由黨的薩穆爾氏、他專從財政問題着眼、他說「航空部長所提的擴張空軍計劃、於所得一鎊、不過負擔一辨士、這不是最初的一辨士、也不是最後的一辨士、我國全體軍費計一萬一千三百萬鎊、對每鎊所得約徵二先令六辨士、如若加算過去的戰費、則每年軍費要三萬五千七百萬鎊、這個數目比所得稅、超過所得稅·財産繼承稅的總收入還更大、……因此而引起軍擴競爭、議會實在没有承認這一提案的勇氣、」政府方面的說明、仍着眼於空軍實力太小、和國防的安全、結果是工黨案被否决、空軍擴張計劃成立、在海軍會議的前夕、英國有如此舉動、是有備戰傾向的、</p>

<p>船中調查嚴密</p>
<p>長崎市况不佳</p>
<p>東鄰的日本、路途很近、十幾年前最慢的船、海程也不過在天、就可以由上海到長崎、現在祗需二十九點鐘了、</p>
<p>在船上、似乎諸凡如意、在上海住久的人、嘗嘗海風滋味、尤覺有一種風趣、然而在另一方面、使我們感到哭笑不得、幾乎要窒息起來、如日本水上警察的調查、從前祗是醫生來騐疫、并没有其他手續、現在騐疫一層、好像不十分注意、却注意到各個人的身分、及來踪去蹟、其所持態度、確非常客氣、而注意點則細入毫髮、的確算是忠於職守、我們先且擱下個人的情感、作冷靜的分析、第一種表現是、他國家組織嚴密、對出入的人、（無論外國人·本國人）都加以統制、這也因日本所處的地位、四週環海、進出皆能確實監視、第二種表現是、他政治上的力量、凡是權力所及的地方、總是盡量的運用、决不空過、更不偷懶、也許就是他非常時期的顯示、敎人明白這不是平時、而是具有特殊的意味、</p>
<p>譬如個人外面兇猛内心懦怯的、人是不足畏的、并且一見就可曉得這没有什麽深遠的企圖、惟有語言間極謙和、態度很恭謹、而其所懷目的確很遠大、採用種種手段又很堅毅、是大可注意的、船上的水警、就是屬於這一類、他對外國人、總是貌爲恭敬、從正面側面尋找你的關係、確知你對於日本表好感的、他始放心、對於日本没有好惡成見的人、他就不放心、若偶、然不愼稍流露、他就要警戒、要防備了同船的一位朋友說、日警總是以惡意度人、并且盡量從壞的方面揣測、所以對於外國來游的人、總是以懷疑態度應付的、</p>
<p>稅關的檢查、普通的三等客人、是在碼頭上施行、頭二等則就船中檢查、據說在船上檢查、是優待旅客、是爲旅客方便而作的、殊不知他檢查有多餘時間時、就可坐下來一件一件的仔細看過、例如紙捲烟·無線電·爆發火藥·手槍·照相機·等類、當然要課重稅、或加以禁止、卽個人日常用具、也都仔細騐看、深怕有什麽挾帶、對於書籍、更不稍放鬆、一册一册都看過、不僅是看看、并且稍可注目的、他就登記在表册上、以備考察、西文書籍、更加留意、總之凡是可以麻煩的地方、總是不避麻煩的、</p>
<p>長崎是距離中國最近的口岸、從前中國人在此地作生意的人很多、商業也相當的發達、現在凋落了、除極少數的幾家洋服店飲食店外、華商差不多没有立足餘地、卽令政治上不有甚麽干涉、然就目前這種經濟不景氣狀况、也恐怕不許生存、船上的中國商人、祗有兩三個人、其餘有十來多個學生、由此可見中日關係、不能圓滑進行中當然的情形啊、</p>
<p>長崎正當一年一度「大祭」之後、蕭條的市况、似乎得到了多少潤澤、但是滄海一滴、又何能止久旱的乾渴、「大廉價」「大賣出」的標語、依然除舊佈新、到處粘貼、市招也滿街衢掛着、而顧客則寥若晨星、門庭冷落、長崎入口不過二十二萬的中流城市、輸出入貿易也相當熱閙、港灣裏停留着一艘美國商船、一艘來遊的法國軍艦、外來的商賈遊歷者亦甚少、雖當局努力使用劇烈的刺激藥、要一般社會興奮起來、無如本身元氣不足、刺激僅有臨時的效能、市面上沿門求乞的人固是少有、而衣不蔽體的、我却親眼看見兩三個、沿大街拾人家抛棄的廢屑紙片、至於營養不充分的人、那就多了、這就表面上所見、怱怱略述一二、以告國人、（十月十一日於長崎）</p>

<p>北平通信、馬蘭峪東陵接收問題、騰傳甚久、其所以未能及早實現者、最初由於駐東陵僞軍撤退問題、往返磋商需時、繼由東陵保管委員會清宗室族裔代表未能推定、與夫北平馬蘭峪間汽車路因雨冲刷、汽車不能行駛、遂使接收日期、無從確定、惟馬蘭峪行政部份、兩月前早經我方接收、並派由殷體新爲薊密區公署駐峪主任、兹所言接收者、厥爲東陵保管責任之移轉、及我方保安隊開入馬蘭峪東陵維持治安而已、</p>
<p>東陵在昔卽有保管委員會、長城戰後、僞軍開入、該會遂無從行使職權、薊密區公署專員殷汝耕、前次與日方交涉結果、駐陵僞軍、於我方接收時、决全部撤出口外、該陵由我方負完全保管責任、同時使保陵委員會組織、略予擴大、增加清室族裔代表二人、該議雙方同意後、清室族裔方面、高年者不願多事、年輕者衆望不孚、此爲代表所以未能卽時推派眞正原因之一、經殷汝耕疊次向清室族裔方面催促結果、業已推定溥僴柏年兩人充任、並於日昨用書面通知薊密區公署知照、該會委員、除薊密區專員·興隆縣長·公署駐馬蘭峪主任·爲當然委員外、並由冀實業廳·民政廳·各派代表一人、清室族裔推代表二人爲委員、共同組織之、頃清室代表旣已推出、該會委員僅民廳尙在遴選、日内即可派定、該會成立期、雖未確定、但在實行接收東陵以前、正式辦公、殊無異議、</p>
<p>關於東陵接收之一切準備、我方於兩個月前、已着手進行、薊密區公署駐馬蘭峪主任殷體新履任之初、卽開始進行、而接收日期、亦經預定、嗣因北方雨水連天、平峪汽車路、積水過膝、交通完全斷絕、致使接收手續、陷於擱淺狀態、一般人傳稱爲無期接收說、關係方面、認爲係不明眞象者之附會、不值一辯、</p>

<p>樂都縣之騾馬大會</p>
<p>由西寗赴武威（凉州）或張掖（甘州）、原有路可達、惟山坡高大、地方僻靜、須裹糧携帳、結隊而行、記者一人、諸感不便、故於七月五日、仍拾原道返蘭州、沿途山脈、自西徂東、高低層疊、併行數百里、大致前列山脈、因與平原河流並行、高度較低、草色嫩黄、後山則一層高一層、山色亦由淺緑而蒼黑、巓積白雪、銀光燦爛、更有高峯、碧藍一線、與天同色、偶於前列山峯凹處依稀見之、然已遠在數百里之外矣、</p>
<p>越兩日、過樂都、正值該縣在東湖公園、舉行騾馬大會、鑼鼓喧天、人聲鼎沸、遠聞數里、塲中高搭戲臺、上懸一紅地金字之紙匾曰、「歡迎馬志武團長」、劇目爲「精忠」、以秦腔唱演、臺前塲中、馬團官兵、握槍席地而坐、四周爲普通觀衆、婦女更遠視於外緣、蒙番男女、則雜沓於各處、衣着紅緑、環佩瑯福、頗有各族團聚樂慶升平之象、據談是會年久停辦、今年驟然恢復、各鄕觀衆、尙爲踴躍、惟騾馬交易、殊形冷落、官紳會議、擬繼續演戲十日、經費來源、（一）捐攤、（二）賭局抽頭、（三）酌徵買賣捐、預料入出兩抵、或可有餘云云、</p>

<p>及抵蘭州、適主席朱紹良、亦由京歸來、當往訪晤、談話要點、大略如下、「甘省治安、幸已日臻佳境、過去一二年事實、已可概見、惟駐軍就地拔欵之成例、尙待設法取消、以言政治、始易著效、甘省財政、歷年不敷、此次本人晋京、特與孔財部長接洽恊欵、已蒙允許設法、若得早成事實、甘政當好推展矣」云云、朱氏要言不煩、甚佩卓見、蓋駐軍就地拔欵之成例、倘不取消、不但財政收入數字、有名無實、對政治建設、卽難作有把握之統盤計劃、甚且在早已使盡過頭力之人民負擔上、往往無形中再加以剥削、哀哀小民、其何以堪、今朱氏洞燭時弊、亟謀補救之道、甘民福音、可謂如在眼前矣、</p>
<p>甘省財政、實屬困難、去歲省府改組以來、雖對整理賦稅、不遺餘力、究因積習已深、改革匪易、查省府整理賦稅之計劃、各縣多未遵照推行、以致本年度收入與支出之指數、竟以五·五三八·七二八元與六·九八五·七九一元之比、尙不足一·四四七·○六三元之譜、以地物博大之甘省、而農民負擔繁重、省庫竭蹶若斯、則整理賦稅、自應期其實現、此爲當局不能辭其責任者、又自另方面觀之、本省軍費支出之鉅大、與建設費用之微薄、亦爲農村經濟衰落生産凋敝之一主要原因、兹將財廳最近供佈本年度一二三月份財政收支表、摘要列次、以便藉覘甘省財政困難情形之一斑、</p>
<p>一月份、「舊管」不敷一百零九萬九千五百七十四元三角五分九厘、「新收」田賦·貨物稅·正雜稅課·等、總計十八萬四千五百八十四元七角七分三厘、「開支」黨務·内政·財政·敎育·軍政·司法·建設·交通·各費、合計三十五萬八千七百零五元三角八分五厘、「比較」支出超過十七萬四千一百二十元六角一分二厘、</p>

<p>根據上列各數、三個月之收支比較、總計出超二十四萬四千六百七十四元一角六分五厘、三個月有此出超鉅數、並徵諸過去歷年不敷之數字、迨至終歲、出超之數、自當高達百數十萬元、其中軍政費占支出數之首位、建設·敎育·等費指數、甚爲微弱、此最近當局之所以有縮减軍費、要求中央恊欵接濟也、當中央嚴令地方政府廢除苛捐雜稅、禁止附加田賦聲中、本省·過去收入之指數、反以雜收占最高地位如此特殊情形下、欲謀整理賦稅、誠非易易矣、</p>

<p>大公社云、我國火油市塲、自被英美俄三國獨覇後、市價雖曾一度跌落、而後因四大公司議定分銷恊定、旋卽一致漲價、最近並聯合抵制柴油提煉火油、對汽油市塲、亦擬積極推進、兹誌各情如下、</p>
<p>抵制柴油提煉火油　據悉、在華之美孚·亞細亞·德土古·光華·四大火油公司、近鑒我國人將柴油提煉火油業已成功、認爲有碍火油營業至深且鉅、故特聯合一致、以謀抵制、其辦法嗣後各公司所售柴油、規定僅供機器需用、如購買者有提煉火油情事、一經發覺、卽停止其購買權、如各公司私自出售、則决嚴予處罰、</p>
<p>汽油銷路驟見激增　又悉、各公司所售之汽油、近以我國公路建設逐漸發達、汽油用途、驟見增加、銷路日見活躍、每月全國銷量、原係五十萬至七十萬加侖、而最近數日、激增至百萬加侖左右、聞各公司尙擬積極積推廣其市塲、以謀挽回其競銷時期之損失云、</p>

<p>— 章淵若稿</p>
<p>丨在中華職業敎育社丨</p>
<p>四·自力主義創造之動機、我何以要創造自力主義、其動機何在、可分四點來講、（一）鑒於歷來救國運動之虚浮、現在一般流行的所謂「運動」、大半是上海話所謂「爛和調」、没有一點實際、有的嘴裏是這樣說、而心想不是那樣想、演講的時候、聲淚俱下、慷慨激昻、回過頭來、嘻嘻哈哈、便没有國家、國家與他無關、祗是個人虚榮私利與他有關、唱高調是拿手好戲、做起實在的事來、他便不負責任了、（二）鑒於國民心理之萎靡、現在國民的精神、眞可說是萎靡不振、非常頽唐、做起事來、互相觀望、互相推諉、甚至自己不做、還要批評人、破壞人、反過來看到權利、就爭先恐後、這在買火車票的時候、就可以看出來了、自力主義、就是要着重國民的義務、振作國民事的精神、啟發國民救國建國的熱誠、（三）本諸民族的歷史的敎訓、這一點講起來太長、現在祗能簡單地分正反兩面來講、照反面看、我剛才已說過、中國民族之衰弱、就是會受社惰力之支配、所以國力無以發展、國家没有力量、從正面看、我們看無論那一國民族、都是從自强努力而生存的、古時越王勾踐的「十年生聚、十年敎訓」「敎訓」是精神上的努力、「生聚」是物質上的努力、他這樣從敎育上、經濟上、各方面努力的結果、就因此救了他的國家、比較近一點的講、德國從前被拿破倫打敗了以後、他們有一個救國的哲家呌Fichte他說「現在要想救國雪恥、先要培養國家的新種子、須埋頭實幹廿多年才有辦法」、德國人上下從這時一點、點的努力起來、終久他戰勝了法國、最近像蘇俄的五年計劃、無論是第一次第二次、那一次不是在充實牠的國力、牠們凖備的越久、戰勝人家的把握愈多、蘇俄明白了國力的關係、因此他是利於遲戰、而日本則利於速戰、因爲他已預備好了、他們從維新時候就努力預備起來了、並且是迎頭趕上的、前一個星期吳稚暉先生、在上海晨報做一篇文章、裏面有一段說、日本人這六十年來的進步眞是驚人當八十年前的時候、日本人還不知道煤呌什麽東西、這句話是吳先生從英國的一個大報上找到的材料、不是過甚其詞、在那的時候、日本所受大家的壓迫、同我們一樣、他自那次以後竭力維新、先打敗中國、後打敗俄國、現在他聞名世界、連俄國英國美國法國對他都不敢輕於嘗試他這六十年來不單是努力、而且是迎頭幹上的努力、全國無論男女老幼、士農工商、都在那裏努力埋頭幹、所以他會有現在如此驚人的國力、所以一個國家要有辦法、能强盛、一定要經過長時間的鍜鍊和凖備、然後才可以行、萬不能痴心妄想、希圖僥倖、在一朝一夕實現我們的理想、（四）本我歷年的主張、我歷年來所發表的文章雖不能算是好、可是我不是唱高調、我是誠誠懇懇的說老實話、這自力主義的創造、是在今年元旦、因爲在大除夕的晚上、我腦子裏的思想很多、我想新年開始、舊年是過去了、在這繼往開來的階段上、我應該怎樣努力我的新生命、我應該怎樣反省我以往的錯誤、在我反省的時候、就得到一個努力的原則、就是自力救國、同時我們找從前的文章考查下、也得着了一個中心思想、雖然没有自力兩個字、而都含有自力的意思在裏頭、我在元旦的早晨、就拿起筆來寫了一個自力主義的綱目、内容共分四十五章、這是我創造自力主義的經過、</p>
<p>五·自力主義之定義與内容、自力主義的定義、用最通俗的方法來講、就是以義務責任爲本位、以國家社會爲對象的、全國動員、努力自强的救國主義、它的功用是可以打動每一個國民的心坎、可以激發每一個國民的建國熱、和責任心、在這一個主義之下、每一個國民、都應負起他對於國家的責任、所以、簡單的講、自力主義是一種「行動主義」、是一種「全民的行動主義」、講到牠的内容就很複雜了、大概可分作四篇第一篇是自力主義之理論、内分好幾章、如自力主義之宇宙觀、自方主義之歷史觀、自力主義之社會觀、自力主義之法律觀、自力主義之民族性、自篇力主義之時代性、自力主義之哲學的基礎、第二是自力主義與各種主義的比較、如自力主義與社會主義的比較、自力主義與自由主義、個人主義之比較、自力主義與民主主義的比較、自力主義與法西斯蒂主義的比較、第三篇是說自力主義之運動、内分中國青年自力救國之覺悟中國智識份子自力救國之覺悟、中國農民、工人、商人、自力救國之覺悟以及中國公務人員自力救國之覺悟等等、此篇着重如何推行自力主義之方案、开指示全體民衆如何努力的方向、第四篇是講自力主義的信仰和信條、這篇也有六七章之多、這是我自力主義内容的輪廓、以語其詳、實非今天一次所能講完、</p>
<p>六·自力主義之哲學基礎　兄弟對於哲學研究很淺、不敢說有如何特殊的發揮、而且現在限於時間、祇能很簡單的講一講、（一）我們中國有一句話説、「天行健君子以自强不息」、中國的「天」字、内容很奥妙、但用我們法學的見解來詮釋、可算是一種「自然法」、君子是比較覺悟而健全的人、譬如諸位、冒大雨來這裏聽講、都可算是君子、至於自强之道、首貴不息、如果今天强、明天不强、這不能算是君子、因爲明天要考試、今天臨時抱佛脚、不能算自强、同樣的、因爲外患的刺激、一時慷慨激昂、痛哭流涕、事過境遷、即不事振作、這也不是自强、這種人、也不能算是君子、君子是要永遠努力而不停止的自强的、這是天給我們安排好的自然法規、我們人類要求生存、就不能不遵從這個天道丨丨自然法、努力自强、所以我的自力主義是本諸這種偉大的永久的普遍的自然法而産生的、我可以說自力主義不是我創造的、是天然的道理、不是我主觀的發明、只是一種純客觀的發現、所以你如果不自强、不努力、就是違反天道、違反自然法、就不是君子、就算是小人、小人是大家都不喜歡聽的名詞、你如要做君子、就當服膺自力主義、講到自然法、雖曾受人抨擊、然在現代法律哲學上、仍很有力量、在法國法學界有一個運動、就是「自然法的復活」、所以、我的思想、并不能算是陳舊、并且還可以代表一種新的趨勢、在中國歷史上、我的主義、也有根據、如王陽明創造的「知行合一」說、他鑒於國人空言誤國、不務實際、所以用知行合一說來糾正一般國民頽廢不振的心理、據說、日本民族的强盛、也頗得力於王陽明知行合一的學說、這更可以證明我的自力主義、與民族復興關係之重大了、其次、如孫中山先生的「知難行易」說、也可以說是自力主義哲學的基礎、關於這一層、大家可去看孫文學說、恕不多談了、（二）在西洋方面我的自力主義也有他的哲學的根據、西洋哲學的源流、可分作兩大派、一個是基督思潮、一個是希臘思潮、基督思潮的特徵、爲（一）獨斷信仰的、（二）主觀傾向、（三）靈的禁慾的、（四）神道的、絕對服從的、（五）致權主義、（六）天國神本位、（七）利他主義、（八）超自然主義、（九）道德的宗敎的希臘思潮的特徵、恰巧與基督思潮相反、（一）客觀的（二）科學的、懷疑的、　騐的、（三）、</p>
<p>肉的、本能的、（四）個人自覺、（五）自由主義、（六）自我滿足、（七）自然主義（八）智識的、藝術的、（九）現在人本位、講到兩個思潮的源流、希臘思潮即甚古人基督思潮史較新、歐洲的哲學思想雖然千變萬化、總脫離不了這兩個思潮的源流、就連最新的法西斯蒂主義以及馬克思共産主義、也離不開這兩個思潮的範圍、所以西洋的哲學思潮、分析起來、大抵不外這兩派、我雖然不是研究哲學的人、不過我對於西洋的哲學思想與他們社會發展的關係、以及這兩種思潮、在他們歷史上所發生的利害、不能不稍加研究、而找出一個結論來、西洋科學的進步、是由十四十五世紀文藝復興運動以後才發動的、其所以會復興的原動力、就是希臘思潮因爲當歐洲中古時代、大家受了基督主義的朦蔽、迷信神、做了僧侣的奴隸、没有自己努力的覺悟、因此造成到處黑暗的狀態、這就是歷史上有名的中古黑暗時代Darkage在這時代、一切科學藝術、文學思想、都不能發展、歐洲那時眞不得了、在這個時候、就有人出來救偏補弊、把埋没千餘年之久的希臘思潮復興起來、從前希臘思潮何以會被基督思潮壓倒呢、就是太講個人主義的發展、與肉的滿足、淫靡至極點、致有羅馬的衰落、那時基督思潮遂應運而生、糾正當時自私自利的淫靡不堪的個人主義然而基督思潮又太抹煞個性的發展、又造成中古的黑暗、於是文藝復興運動、又重新把希臘思潮復興起來、重個性、使個人自覺、於此可見西洋的哲學思想、兩者各有利弊、没有十全十美的、文藝復興以後、産生兩朶鮮花、（甲）産業革命、一切物質、都充分發展、造成他們的物質文明、（乙）法國革命、推動了各國政治與社會制度的改進、不過到了現在、歐洲的思潮、又因爲現代社會的病象、激起了劃時代的突變、這種突變具體的表現、屬於左派的、就是蘇俄的共産革命、屬於右派的便是法西斯蒂主義（參看拙著現代法制概論、商務印書館出版）、這兩種主義的性質、雖極端不同、但有幾種精神如實行獨裁、不容懷疑、不容自由、都大同小異、這就是西洋近代思潮的大轉變、現在的世界、好像又在動盪了、而這種動盪、其實不過又恢復到原有路向去而已、所以西洋人的思想、拆穿了西洋鏡、變來變去、終是那一套没有什麽稀奇、現在有一班人專歡喜投機、看見這種東西漲了、把牠抛出、那東西賤了、把牠買進、到交易所的人、都想發財、然而結果投黄浦的人也很多、同時做政治工作的人、也是一樣的可憐、看見外國新來的東西、便拚命買進、竭力宣傳、結果則一次都不成功、長此以往、不自己立定主義、單去盲從别人、結果恐非送四萬萬人民都到黄浦江不止、這是何等的危險呢、我們要爲民族、作百年千秋的打算、時時投機是不行的、所以我也不買進、也不賣出、做那種發財生意、我是主張、要不偏不倚、允得其中、我們旣已從歷史的經騐中、體會到希臘思潮與基督思想的利弊、就應該取長捨短、救偏補弊的、來調整他、我的自力主義、一方面以「義務責任」爲本位、一方面又以國家社會爲對象、所以一方面旣不容個人自私自利、一方面又不抹煞自我發展、在利他·服從信仰·諸端·與基督思潮近似、在個人自覺一點、又和希臘思潮一致、但是在自由、和自我滿足的精神上、又和希臘思潮相反、所以、在哲學的基礎上、我的自力主義、可說又是調整西洋兩大哲學思潮的取長補短、救偏補弊的産品、</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三回　未解飄零窺門憐少女願聞困苦惜玉訪貧家</p>
<p>李士廉指着茶房門口的茶房道：這個你問他就明白了。茶房笑了進來低聲道：我們這裏有幾個作生意的姑娘，張先生要看看嗎？剛才院子裏站着的一個，也是外省人作官，流落在西安的。張介夫聽說，不由臉上笑出幾道斜紋來，問道：若是呌進來看看，要幾個錢？茶房還不曾答覆，李士廉笑道：我們來謀事的人，一個錢没有弄到，倒要在這裏花這樣虚花的錢，那不太没有意思了嗎？張介夫笑道：我不過是好奇心，要看看而已。李士廉笑道：你若說是好奇心，我倒可以介紹一個人給你看看。於是將剛才所看到的那位逃難姑娘，以及賈多才所報告的話，都說了一遍。茶房在旁邊，哦了一聲道：說别人不知道，說到王家巷子八號，這是小脚胡嫂子家裏，有什麽不知道，我們這裏的衣服，一大半都是送給他去洗。不錯的，今天我看到他家裏來了幾位女的，就是李先生說的吧？那要看，容易得很，我明天就引他來，用不着花錢。張李二人聽說不用花錢，這就一致贊成。他們兩人在這裏一番談論，又被程志前聽着。他心想，這些人不想鑽營小官做，就是算計别家的女人，在這兒聽着，可就有點煩膩了。於是也就踱出門來，看看他們是些什麽舉動。這兩個人倒是乖覺，以爲他是和廳長有來往的人，多少總有求他的時候，在他面前，就不應當露出不規矩的樣子來，於是各收了笑容，張介夫搭訕着道：呵！這兩個德國人，眞是花錢花得厲害，在這種地方，他們還要吃西餐。（三九）</p>

<p>— 翟秀峯</p>
<p>東坡詩云：「一年好景君須記，最是橙黄橘緑時。」</p>
<p>足跡遍閩江珠江流域的友人說：「南國的深秋，還是熱烘烘地，不過可以少流些汗水；那些蒼翠欲滴的緑葉，也比夏天瘦些，惟其如此，便格外可愛了。而南國特産的橙啊，橘啊，紅艶艶，黄騰騰，纍纍的堆滿枝頭，差不多要壓斷椏枝似的，眞是奇觀。」</p>
<p>本來南國的風物，是值得人們贊賞的，尤其是皮薄而味珍，脈不黏膚，食不留滓的南中橙柑，更够人顚倒。襟江帶海的海門，因爲土質氣候的關係，祇産柑，味酸，愛吃的人較少，可是那橙黄的色調，也美極了。</p>
<p>一天，我到鄕野閒步，在一家茅舍人家的屋角看見一個將要乾癟的中年婦人，把伊的面有菜色八九歲大的兒子責打着，孩子祇是哭。原來那個中年婦人，把一樹柑子，賣給水菓販，換幾天的食糧，這未通人事的孩子，哭閙着，他想留着自己吃，這才惱怒了伊，兇狠地打了幾下。</p>
<p>現實社會等於地獄啊，無邪的孩子，當然不了解現實社會的辛酸的。</p>
<p>「没有飯吃會餓死的，没有柑子吃不會餓死的！你留着柑子不肯賣，到底要不要吃飯？……」我走了還聽着伊半申斥半敎訴的說。</p>
<p>「没有柑子吃不會餓死的！」啊一年好景君須記，這是一年好景中的一幅剪影嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c156">採白菓 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>秋初的黄昏時候，喚賣熱白菓的聲浪，喧擾在街頭巷尾，招致一般小兒女各各掏錢去購食。</p>
<p>在我的故鄕，丨松江丨也有這種喚賣熱白菓的小販，不過他們所賣的白菓，不像上海一般小販們向南貨店中購取生的而炒熟，却是向樹主包下這棵樹來而自行採取的。因爲在我故鄕有很多的銀杏樹，每逢夏末，枝頭纍纍的果實，眞像葡萄一般的衆多。大風起時，也會像雨點般吹下來，摔痛人的頭顱。</p>
<p>講到我們所吃的白菓，實在不是果肉而是核仁，因爲白菓剛結實時，像李子一般大小，外皮是青色而有黑點。它的果肉，不但酸澀不能入口，便是沾着人的指膚，也要脫去一重指皮。所以白菓剛採下時，先要浸在水中，使它果肉腐爛掉，然後撈起核仁，晒乾後應用。</p>
<p>鄕下人以爲銀杏是有神靈憑附的，所以採取果實之先，焚香點燭，三牲敬獻，誠惶誠恐的磕了幾個響頭；纔敢用了長梯，爬上樹去，再拿長竿，把成簇的果實敲下來。</p>
<p>鄕下人向樹主購買白菓，倒也古道可風。他們在結實時，講妥價錢，付下定洋；到成熟時採取付清。白菓成熟的好歹，收取的多少，各憑天命，兩不反悔。而且鄕人採取之後，一定送幾斤給樹主，賓主禮讓，融融洽洽，也是各項交易中少見的呀！</p>
<h3 id="c157">出像水滸傳 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 花病鶴</p>
<p>施耐庵水滸傳，所描寫的人物，有人推測，是以龔聖與的三十六人像贊爲藍本的。據癸辛雜識裏面所載，如關勝贊云：「大刀關勝，豈雲長孫？雲長義勇，汝其後昆。」所以水滸傳寫來，宛然雲長模樣。在龔贊之後，尙有明人陳章候杜堇兩家的像贊。杜本有清初廣百宋齋刋本，凡一百六人。陳本有醉耕堂刋本，（一名出像水滸傳，係明本，流傳甚尠。）從宋江起至徐寗，凡四十人。兩書的像贊，都很可誦。現在把陳本抄録二首如下：</p>
<p>「桃花馬上石榴裙，錦繖英雄娘子軍。」扈三娘</p>
<p>「提葫蘆，唱鷓鴣，酒家胡。」顧大嫂</p>
<p>最近據外論社天津訊載：「玉田縣區域内，發現大批女匪。……聞土匪軍械極精，皆爲能戰之女兵，利用其花容月貌，肆行誘惑，以遂行其刦掠行爲。」按灤東近來匪風甚熾，而此等女匪，尤大有扈三娘顧大嫂的遺風。所謂利用其花容月貌，肆行誘惑者，大約不外乎從冒充類似酒家胡的入手。至於行其刦掠行爲，則簡直是錦繖英雄娘子軍矣。出像水滸傳。雖然將梁山泊上的好漢，描摹得有聲有色，然而終結宋朝歷史上，沾了一個政治不良的污點。而現在我們，尤不願在青天白日的黨治下，更有新出像水滸傳的發現。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這話倒是不錯的！東三省和中國本部，實在祗是一家，以前也許還有幾分的隔膜，但自清朝定鼎以後，東三省人的種種特性，幾乎全被中土的人所同化了，那裏還有什麽分别？</p>
<p>「當明朝末年，」皇太后的話匣子，竟因這一重感觸而大開特開了。「原有一位吳三桂將軍在這裏鎭守着，和我們列成敵對的形勢。不料其時中國内部，正給流寇騷擾得不堪設想，官兵不但不能剿滅，反給他們一陣陣的殺敗下來；最後，連崇禎皇帝的寳座，也漸漸地坐不住了。於是吳將軍便差人來向我們借兵求救，我們立即答應了，他還親自開了門，把我們迎接進來；從此，我們便長驅直入，得到了整個的天下。這正出乎意料之外的大收穫！然而從此使中國本部和東三省完全溝成一氣，也未始非雙方之福。」</p>
<p>太后在小山上足足留連了一個多時辰，待我們大家都眺望得生厭的時候，伊老人家却還在高瞻遠矚地望得很上勁咧。到後來，伊忽然又發了一個很奇特的命令，說是要到海濱去看那長城入海的所在。我無論如何也想不出伊是爲了什麽緣故，特地要去考察那一處無關緊要的部份。</p>
<p>「從前的時候，」伊用手指點着那些頽壞的殘跡，用一種感慨的語調說道：「這一部份濱海的長城的建築，尤比别處築得特别的堅固，面積也是特别的廣大，彷彿有兼作防海的長堤的意思。（一四九）</p>

<p>女：我正也十分愛你，不過我是抱「獨身主義」的，要我嫁給你那就難了！</p>

<p>女：我眞快活，今天已是兩個孩子的母親了。</p>
<p>男：我現在却抱獨身主義了。</p>

<p>— 沙洲</p>
<p>當我們在湓地似的東坪住了一夜，明天的飯後便到得西津了，連天都在山地上跑，聽說山字都頭疼了。可是嚮導又說到東遊去還得翻一頂牛頭嶺，於是便立刻决定要走水路。水路是東溪的一叚。</p>
<p>尖尾兒的小蚱蜢船是没有舵和漿的，清淺的水流恰巧比到船身深這麽一點，河床是全部水成岩構成的，篙子的尖端的岩石上觸出了清脆的聲音，蚱蜢船的速度在這尖聲上也可以聽得出的。航到淺灘上，水聲是流得一片響，船夫便赤了脚下水扶着船走了，榨糖的水磨是悽惋地在啼號，但是山野是太俊秀了，原隰上的樹葉還是那樣地葱翠，南國的氣候原是四季都是春啊。</p>
<p>到水口，依然翻了幾頂山，不過我已到得閩江的岸邊了。</p>
<p>在未到閩江岸邊之前，我是想像着閩江的浩大的，但是等到閩江已在望，我却覺得事實與想像的不同來。</p>
<p>兩岸的高山已經規定了閩江的線路了，從山澗裏涓流着的水到這裏已變得這樣的深碧，從上游急急地流到這裏，又從這裏急忙地流了下去，我不知水流爲什麽要這樣忽忽，但是這不就是一個極現成的人生的說明嗎？於是我對於閩江生出一種薄命來，閩江是憂鬱的喲！</p>
<p>裝着汽船設備的民船，是被××司令部的人佔滿，船家和乘客是爭論着一個價格各不相讓的。聽得一陣亂槍打出的婦人在十幾分鐘之後探出了驚懼的頭，一雙不穿襪子的天足是健壯的，這裏挑水的事情是女人做。假如「南國多佳人」的話是存在的，那麽南國的佳人是以健美見佳的，質諸人體美研究家，不知以爲如何？</p>
<p>從水口舟行到閩清，不須十小時，兩岸的蒼山是這樣的緊靠，這樣的呌人安閒，我聽着船櫓的聲音，水流在船底下的聲音，心地是一片平靜，好像我已置身於千里以外的水都之故鄕了。但是可恨那噩夢一樣的事實又敎我驚異，而將懷鄕的思緒打得片屑無餘啊。</p>
<p>說來似乎像傳奇，那赤着身子滿身掛着黄紙符咒的男子，難道眞的還存在於現世嗎？但是他的獰笑，他的惡聲都清清明明的存在於記憶裏啊！可是我並不覺得這些信奉邪術的人的可恨反而以爲這是一班愚盲的蠢貨呀。中國在世界各國激急地製造出一批一批殺人的利器來的時候還保有這種可笑的槍彈不能上身的法術，但請向人家用毒瓦斯用死光來殺你們的時候，不知還有什麽法術會使得毒氣不能上身否？</p>
<p>到閩清，正是上燈的時候了。在戰燄稍息時候的閩清是默默的。</p>

<p>以四對二敗北</p>
<p>西聯甲組一幕</p>
<p>優游足球隊本屆雖得新將之補充、然而陣綫上實力之不平均、爲不可諱飾之事實、於昨日對華塞斯之一戰、缺點乃益見、卒因此而以四對二爲華塞斯所敗、於甲組錦標前途希望上、不無受一打擊也、上半時結果爲三對一、觀者五六千人、申園一時稱盛、</p>
<p>優游攻門全仗右翼　優游後衛大將江善敬因腿傷未出塲、以張容入替、總覺不如、徐亨守門雖可、但迫於敵鋒猛攻之下、亦有無可如何之嘆、前鋒最感痛苦者、爲左翼實力之薄弱、上星期易王南珍爲奚巧生、今又以符和萱替奚巧生、能力彷彿、此爲優游最大之缺憾、於是前鋒之活動、全憑鍾孫羅三人、回顧對方、聯絡純熟、動作敏捷、其得勝、非倖致也、</p>
<p>險象百出三城連失　優游開球、轉瞬即被迫而回、華塞斯之前鋒憑其巧妙純熟之聯絡、開始猛迫、球盤旋在優游腹地不出、五步之外、十步之内、險象百出、如是者凡十分鐘、優游之門、亦即於此時破落、克立夫脫飛進、向中挑傳、茂林傳右、陶樂威見地位不佳、再回送左方、阿巧乘勢冲上、砰然蹴入、清晰可觀、紀録旣開、華塞斯勢仍不减、七分鐘之内、中鋒茂林連射連進、遂成三對零、</p>
<p>挽回二球無濟於事　優游雖傾全力以反攻、鍾勇森頗受嚴密監視之苦、孫錦順亦曾有三次攻門之機會、惜皆未成就、距上半時完結僅二分鐘、鐘勇森在右方飛進球落門前、羅海光跳起一頂、來個正着、上半時得成三對一、</p>
<p>下半時易地後、鍾勇森又在右方活動、球傳左去、梁樹棠攻入、相差僅一球矣、不料在十分鐘内、阿巧得史密斯之傳、又被射入、成四對二、優游挽救之希望遂微、即以此數維持終局、</p>

<p>敎部社會敎育司司長張炯、十三日發表對於民衆學校課本改編之意見云、我國往日民衆學校課本、大概均注重識字一方面、其他常識公民三民主義等、都是附屬的、所以民衆學校課本多稱某某千字課、如三民主義千字課、農民千字課、市民千字課平民千字課等是、即表面未標明千字課、而其内容亦包涵一千字者、如識字課本·民衆讀本·婦女讀本·民衆識字課本等是、蓋以前一般熱心社會敎育事業者與研究社會敎育之專家、都以爲民衆之愚蠢由於不識字或少識字、如能使民衆認識普通應用之字、在一千左右、則必能閱報必能看書、必能寫應用文字、必能吸收現時代一切的新知識、譬如一匠師、有斧斵刀鋸等之工具在乎、可以製桌椅、可以造房屋、更可以作其他一切器具也、不知編輯民衆學校課本、注重字數、有下列三種困難、</p>
<p>（一）語句不能整齊；</p>
<p>（二）文字不能短簡；</p>
<p>（三）意義不能選擇。</p>
<p>兹將炯對於民衆學校課本應行改編之意見分叙於左、</p>
<p>（一）文字方面　此次編輯課本、文字不必求多、多八九百字、少六七百字亦可、其筆畫煩難與不常用之字力求避免、蓋敎一字即能認識一字、且能永久記憶一字、則較之勉强注入而過後輒忘者、其益實多多矣、</p>
<p>（二）語句方面　此次編課本、在每課每句、字數多寡不必限定、少三四字一句、多六七字一句亦可、但從頭至尾、均擬用平易的韻語或成語、使讀者不感困難、容易發生興趣而印象較深、縱經過長久時間、亦能記憶、</p>
<p>（三）意義方面　此次編輯課本、文字原不必求多、但含義必須豐富、關於做人做國民重要之知識、擬盡量編入課本中、使民衆讀此課本後、不但個人道德當有進步、並且知道中國是一個甚麽國家、個人與社會的關係如何、個人與國家的關係如何、國難嚴重的情形更如何、如此則對於國家庶能盡國民之職責、對於國難庶能激發救國之熱忱、似於個人、於國家、兩有裨益、</p>
<p>（四）分量方面　此次編輯課本、擬將做人做國民最重要的原理原則、選出約八十條、編爲八十課、作爲基本課本、以供初級民衆學校之用、此外因地域職業之不同、風俗習慣之不同、則由當地敎育行政機關或社會敎育機關另編補充及應用課本、以與本部所編課本相輔而行、（補充課本不必用韻語編輯、以期適於實用）如此則重要之知識、民衆可以盡量吸收而無其他欠缺或扦格之虞、</p>

<p>— 李廷安</p>
<p>二、同學方面　肺癆病第二點的害處是患者能够傳染於其他學生，使和患者一般的受害。</p>
<p>三、經濟方面　這是第三點的害處，國家花許多經費把學生敎出便死了。這種損失頗大，據敎育界之統計一個大學生培养成功約費三萬元左右，假使死去一個則經濟上即損失三萬元之鉅！</p>
<p>因此肺癆問題，很是嚴重，我們的統計並非杜撰而是根據檢查的結果。關於學童肺癆問題，諸位應該留意：</p>
<p>補救辦法</p>
<p>肺癆病的補救辦法很難，分開來說第一要點</p>
<p>一、改良衣食住等生活狀况　改良衣食住等生活狀况頗難辦理。因爲這是經濟問題，我們不得肺癆病由於我們身體健康，抵抗力大，抵抗力的來源由於衣食住適宜。衣祗要能保護體温，不必綾難綢緞，所以這還不生問題。最重要的是食，食猶燒煤，煤料惡劣火爐也不會怎樣優良，談到吃什麽食物，現在没有時間同各位講。至於住要有新鮮空氣，充足陽光才好。這一切要希望國家政治上軌道，經濟有辦法，始能解决。日本目前已經做到。我國在現狀下尙談不到此，縱或有之也祇是一小部分而已！</p>
<p>二、調查和試驗　除改良衣食住等生活狀况外，要做調查工作，和「結核素」試騐。每個學校經醫師試騐，有陽性反應者照愛克司光，檢查無病當然是我們所希望，不幸有病就應該趕緊設法醫治。</p>
<p>三、處置患者　患者在原則上可分爲最重，重，輕，最輕四個等級，重者應卽停學，免得傳染他人與危害自己，輕者可以讀書，但時間宜少，家長應加滋補食物，晚間睡在新鮮空氣中。現在衛生局和敎育局等機關聯合辦了一個夏令營，招收兒童供給滋補食物和適宜運動。日常生活是早上七點起身，七點半鐘早餐，八點讀書，十點半鐘進牛奶一杯，十二點午飯，飯後睡眠二小時，以後是遊戲時間，五點洗浴，八點睡覺。每六個星期共收費十二元，衛生局津貼十元共計二十二元都用在兒童營養上面，我相信這些小孩的體重一定會增加，而患最輕症肺癆者依此做去也一定可以養好。</p>
<p>四、普及健康敎育　人體和機器一樣，我們要汽車駕駛得好，必須曉得汽車各部分的構造，加意保護。換句話說，我們要保持學生身體健康也得要使學生明白身體情形，所以健康敎育爲最重要。應該在學校課程中列爲必修科目。現在世界各國對此尙未能有普遍的注意。我們知道學校不注意健康敎育和不敎汽車夫學汽車機械之内容及駕駛方法的弊端正復相同。是以應了解身體各部分的機關，明瞭保健方法，以及灌輸防疫的重要是第四個補救方法。</p>
<p>最後綜結一下：第一點肺癆病之在我國是很普遍，第二點學生方面在剛才報告的統計上諸位研究一下數目必定很多！第三點預防方法爲改良生活環境，調查和試騐，處置患者及普及健康敎育。這是兄弟對於補救辦法的意見。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c192">舊醫五淋白濁的解說 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>（編者按）　謝筠壽醫師近著淋病眞相。將淋病之危險以及症狀經過醫治方法。詳細說明。内容豐富。現已發行。定價四角，出售處在本埠愛文義路派克路平和里十九號謝醫師診所。及四馬路作者書社。大東書局。兹特摘録其中一段。以作介紹。</p>
<p>幾千年來被舊醫勢力籠罩下的國民。對於舊醫所說的虚呀，勞呀，熱呀。眞是聲聲入耳。絲絲入叩。毫不會懷疑着的。但是從現在科學的眼光看起來。各種疾病的眞相。大多已逐漸地明瞭。這樣玄虚的病名。實在没有存在的餘地。我現在想把舊醫所講的「五淋白濁」。來解說一下。</p>
<p>舊醫把淋病分做五種。就是勞淋，熱淋，氣淋，血淋，和石淋。他們以勞淋氣淋屬虚。熱淋屬熱。血淋有熱有虚。石淋或因熱或因虚。長久了便成功砂石。勞淋的症狀是因勞傷虚損。變成小便不出。小腹急痛。尿出白汁。一點一滴的樣子。氣淋小腹急滿。小便要解不出。解後常有點滴的樣子。熱淋小便熱而赤。短而澀。臍下急痛。血淋小便内有血滴或血條。石淋還呌做砂淋。小腹急漲。莖内痛如刀割。苦楚萬狀。尿如砂石</p>
<p>以上都是舊醫關於五淋的病理和症狀。從吾們新醫的立塲講起來。他所說五淋的範圍。實在是太廣義了。凡是從尿道口有分泌物或固形物出來的疾病。都可以呌做淋。原來淋字有淋漓的意思。淋漓是一種病的症狀。那裏是一種病的名稱。定病名應當以解剖上的地位和病原的種類來分别。所以五淋的一種病。在舊醫以爲分得很出透了。從新醫的眼光看來。還是糢糊莫辨。推測他的病狀。實在包含着沁尿器業　上種種的疾病。他的勞呀，氣呀，熱呀等的名稱。是不對的。究竟舊醫五淋的病名底不。包含着幾多的新醫疾病呢。詳細的自然是難以針鋒相對的一一列舉起來。現在把最相近的幾種新醫疾病提出來討論一下。</p>
<p>第一種就是淋病。淋病的原因。是因爲淋病的病原菌就呌做雙球菌的傳染而起。他的主要病狀。是小便刺痛。尿意頻數。尿道有白色或是黄色的分泌物流出。這是急性的時候。好似舊醫所講的熱淋。倘是病勢凶惡。症候劇烈。尿道粘膜破碎的時候。竟有血液一同流出。那時候舊醫就呌做血淋了。但是淋病一樣是淋病。不過淋病的程度上有差别。還是有淋病的人。倘使變成了慢性。在平時分泌物很少。或竟然不覺得。遇着了勞動的時候。分泌物就多加起來。那時舊醫就呌做勞淋。其實他的病還是淋病。不過因勞動而發的罷了。倘使你没有淋病的種子在你身上。斷斷不會發生淋病的。所以勞淋的病名。是不成立。倘使淋病病菌波及到膀胱。就覺到小腹急滿。小便欲解不出。好似舊醫所講的氣淋。其實何常是氣。實在是一種淋菌性膀胱炎的緣故。解判起來。他的膀胱粘膜上。確確實實是有病變的。</p>
<p>第二種是屬於膀胱的疾病。膀胱受着各種細菌（結核菌，淋菌等）的傳染。或是外傷，感冒，中毒，急性傳染病的時候。膀胱發生炎症。或是膀胱發生腫瘍和潰瘍的時候。他的症候。就是尿意頻數，和放尿時候的疼痛。膀胱部（下腹部）的壓痛。小便溷濁。好似舊醫氣淋一樣。有時往往混著血液。那就變成舊醫的血淋。倘是慢性的膀胱炎。安靜的時候。没有多大病狀。勞動了或是身體不健全的時候。病狀就要凶起來。那時候豈不是也可以呌他勞淋嗎。</p>
<p>第三種是屬於腎臟的疾病。有幾種腎臟病的時候。也有尿意頻數，血尿，小便溷濁等樣的症候。</p>
<p>第四種是尿結石症。正和舊醫的石淋或是砂淋相似。結石的成功。是因爲尿中的成分。譬如尿酸，燐酸鹽類，蓚酸鹽類等沈澱後所結成。他的大小。很不一定。有的小如砂粒。有的大如雞卵。他發生的地位。也有在腎臟内的。也有在輸尿管，膀胱或尿道内的。他的症狀。隨着結石的大小，形狀，地位。有種種的不同。譬如在腎臟或輸尿管的時候。發生腎石疝痛。就是腰部的劇痛。有時波及到膀胱，睪丸，上腿，背部，和肩胛。還有發熱，尿意頻數，血尿等等。倘是在膀胱或尿道。發生着奇異性的尿閉。就是有時候可任意小便。有時候不可小便。還有小便時候的劇痛和小便出血等症候。</p>
<p>此外還有「乳糜血尿」。尿中混有血液。這是因爲一種住血絲狀蟲的寄生到腎臟内而發生的疾病。以及尿道内種種的疾病。所以五淋白濁的名稱。實在很廣汎。凡是泌尿器系統上。譬如腎臟，輸尿管，膀胱，尿道上。受着一切的外傷，細菌的傳染，中毒等的時候。都可以發生尿意頻數，小便疼痛，分泌物流出，小便有血等病狀。所以科學醫的診病。醫師應當一一診斷他的地位和原因。方才可以呌做看病。否則因勞而發。呌做勞淋。小便熱赤。呌做熱淋。小腹急滿。呌做氣淋。有血呌做血淋。生石呌做石淋。那未免太容易看病了。</p>

<p>— 李興</p>
<p>（二）飲食</p>
<p>飲食爲人生活所絕對不可少的。人生活的能力必須由滋養料得來。飲食如同汽車的汽油，汽車没有了汽油就不能行動，人没有了滋養料就不能生活長久。無病的人數日或多日食物少進，身體日漸軟弱當爲自然之結果。有病人，特别是發熱的病人一日之内消耗很多滋養料與身體的細胞。若無充分的滋養料修補則病勢之轉重當然不是意外的。此處所講的飲食不是隨便什麽人都曉得如何供給病人相當的飲食。我們必須明白食物化學，生理化學的原理，與醫學常識才能曉得供給病人的飲食與他的病與他的身體有好處。兹略述病人飲食的基本科學於後以供讀者之研究：</p>
<p>近年來因化學與生理化學的進步，我們曉得食物是什麽原料，進到腸胃内起什麽變化，滋養料被吸收到血内後有什麽功用。以化學的分類法我們吃的一切食物分爲以下四種：第一種是脭類（或作蛋白質（Protein）在身内的功用是生長修補筋肉器官。一部分在身體需要時變爲炭水化合物，以作生熱生力之用，特别富於蛋白質的食物爲肉類，蛋類，黄豆（豆腐），胡桃，花生，牛奶等。米麥内亦含一小部分蛋白質。一個人身重一百五十磅的每日需七十格蘭姆（約二兩）蛋白質。每一格蘭姆蛋白質可變爲四個加路里熱。第二種是炭水化合物（小粉糖類），在身内的功用是生熱生力（注意生熱不是「發熱」，人不是冷血動物他的身體必須時時生熱。）在上篇已述明無病人的體温是華氏表九十八度十分之六。有人問，北冰洋一帶無病人的體温是多少度？熱道人的體温是多少度？答，都是九八·六度。爲什麽呢？人的身體是一個奇妙的化學機，自己會生熱也會生力，並且無病時也可管着身體有一定的温度。一個火車機車爐内有了炭，汽鍋内再加上水便可以生熱生力。人身内的炭就是炭水化合物，是從米麵糖類菜蔬水果而來的。炭水化合物每一格蘭姆可生四個加路里熱。這是食物中最要緊的一類。第三種是油類（或作脂肪）油類食物在身内的功用是生熱或作儲存的能力或保護身體。葷素油，胡桃花生菜子亦多含油。每一格蘭姆油可生九個加路里熱。第四種是水水是身内各種生活素的媒介。身體如果因不吃食物缺乏之小粉糖類，身體第一步將所儲存的格來克眞（身體儲存的糖類）用作生熱生力，好像一個人没有了進欵就先將自己所集蓄的用完。格來克眞用完了，第二步將身體的脂肪漸漸變爲炭水化含物，用作生熱生力。第三步將身體筋肉器官的脭（蛋白質）一部分變爲炭水化合物亦作同樣功用。總而言之，發熱病人如食物的滋養料不充足，必須將自己筋肉細胞變爲生熱生力的材料。此卽飲食不得當身體消瘦的原因。反之，假設病人可以得到豐富合宜的滋養料身體當然不至於消瘦。</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（十九）腦漏的解釋</p>
<p>一般人對於患有鼻腔閉塞，鼻内流出濃厚的膿樣分泌物，嗅覺减退等時候。就稱他爲腦漏。其實腦何以會漏。如果眞有其事。那就除非頭部受着損傷。以致頭骨破裂。方可漏出腦來。此時受患人的生命。也就將要發生問題了。至於從鼻腔裏面漏出腦來的事實。我不要說没有見過。就是聽也没有聽過啊。普通所以稱爲腦漏的緣故。恐怕因爲鼻腔的分泌物。是從鼻腔的深部流出來的時候。彷彿和從腦内流出來一樣。所以才用「腦漏」兩個字來形容這種病情罷了。不能算是一種病名。在醫學的解判學上講起來。鼻和腦。完全是由骨壁相隔。這種骨壁，都是構成副鼻腔的骨壁。所以如果副鼻腔發生炎症。那就這種骨壁裏面的粘膜。立刻就可腫脹發赤。初則分泌粘液。後則分泌濃汁。不過他所發生的病况。各有不同。因爲副鼻腔（原名Sinus　Paranasalis）可以分爲四腔。就是（一）上顎竇Sinus　Maxillaris（二）前額竇SinusFrontalis，（三）篩骨蜂窩CellulaeEthmoidales，和　（四）蝴蝶竇Sinus　Sphenoidalis。這四種副鼻腔的解剖關係。各有持殊的情形。所以病人的自覺症候和臨床的所見。也就各有特别不同的地方。我現在分别略爲講一講。對於腦漏的解釋上。也許更可明瞭些啊。</p>
<h3 id="c196">（一）急性上顎竇炎 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Sinuitis　Maxillaris　Acuta</p>
<p>急性上顎竇炎的原因甚多。可以分爲一，續發於急性鼻加答兒和流行性感冒的時候最多。二，續發於猩紅熱，麻疹，肺炎。三，從鼻腔内手術，鼻腔異物，上顎骨損傷，竇壁的梅毒和腫瘍等。也可引起本病的發生。四，往往由齲齒亦可發生本病。就是在第二小臼齒，第一大臼齒，第二大臼齒，第三大臼齒當中。若有齲齒的時候。他的齒槽突起（牙齒生根的部位）。常可繼發骨膜炎或骨炎。終至引起竇炎。</p>
<p>本病的初期。常有發熱，惡寒，全身倦怠，食慾不振等現象。至於患着本病的痛苦。就是在上顎骨部。常有緊張感覺。或訴疼痛。疼痛往往波及前額部。並可因咳嗽，噴嚔，或頭部前傾。而增劇他的强度。還有齒痛，鼻閉塞，鼻汁過多，嗅覺减退等。亦爲常發的症候。此時病人的頰部。大都腫脹發赤。且有壓痛。若用鼻鏡檢查鼻腔。卽可察見下甲介和中甲介的粘膜。都很發赤腫脹。在中鼻道和下甲介的内面。都有膿汁或膿綫的存在。膿汁通常爲粘液膿性。有時混有血液。此種膿汁裏面含有的細菌。大概是化膿性連鎖球菌和肺炎球菌最多。至於像化膿性葡萄狀球菌，白喉菌，流行性感冒菌等。那就比較少些。</p>
<p>本病如果加以適當的治療。一二星期卽可完全治愈。否則就要轉到慢性上顎竇炎。那就難於治療了。</p>
<p>講到本病的治療方法。最初當用發汁藥和温菴法。或照沙羅克司燈。或用電光頭浴。均可使分泌物容易吸收。一方面應當設法使鼻腔粘膜的腫脹。迅速消退。因爲竇内的分泌物。可以因此容易排出。若有排膿被阻碍的時候。那就一定要用探管。探入竇内。洗出膿汁。如由齲齒引起的急性上顎竇炎。當然同時要請牙科醫師診治。方爲得當啊。（待續）</p>

<p>第八章　臨床檢查法</p>
<p>或者有人要説；關於臨床檢查法的種種，雖關重要；但這是醫者本身事，病家並無須知道如此清楚的。話是說得不錯。但是我們要曉得，中國一般病家的醫學常識太形缺乏了，在患病的時候，雖說是離不了新醫，但他們所「五體投地」的，不過是驚人的治療成績而已，對於病症的認識究竟眞確與否，是完全不明瞭的。所以儘敢有許多醫者，他們的態度是非常虚心的，必然的診斷是不輕容易下的，但結果對病家大半是格格不相入的；甚至對種種精密詳細的檢查工作，認爲非常瑣碎，煩擾不堪，於病者絲毫無補的。這一種錯誤觀念，在一般病家的腦海中，幾乎是十之八九存在的。不知科學的眞義，首在存疑與戒除武斷，新醫學是科學的産兒，當然是不外此例的了。爲免除這種誤會起見，對於臨床上種種檢查工作必須的原因，我覺得在一般人心目中，也應該有一個明確的了解纔好。</p>
<p>臨床檢查法的重要，上面大概已經述過了；他包括的範圍也是狠廣的，根據他的性質，可分作下面的六種；（一）旣往症，（二）物理的檢查，（三）痰的檢查，（四）血液的檢查，（五）專門的診斷，（六）Ｘ光的診斷，爲讀者們易明白起見，對於每種的大概情形，我現在且一一的分叙在下面。</p>

<p>（一）創辦緣起　藥爲現代最實用最切要之一種專門科學。不可以不研究。此稍有科學常識者。當不否認。惜國人拘於數千年之陳腐思想。摒醫藥於士農工商之外。尤其對於藥。視爲無足輕重。雖醫學年有進步。設校培才。名家輩出。獨藥學鮮有人注意。藥師人才。寥落無幾。欲求新穎高深之藥學。非負笈海外。末由問津。所謂國藥。仍固守古法煎製。不知利用科學提煉。仿造新藥。坐令舶來藥品。大量傾銷。無法抵制。且新醫增加。外藥之輸入數量。亦隨之增加。每年漏巵。輒以千萬計。可爲浩嘆。遠瞻各國。藥學家化學家。莫不爭先恐後。搜集我國藥材。窮日研究。例如從麻黄中發見有發汗作用之Ｅphedrine。當歸中發見有調經作用之Eumenol等。均爲其研究所得之顯著成績。我國神農嘗百草。在西歷紀元前數千百年。爲研究藥之始祖。遠於西藥之發明。我國旣富有天然良好之藥材。國人若能繼先賢之發明。加以精進研究。兼能設廠自製。將出品推銷海外。豈獨利便世界。造福人類。光輝於世界國際醫藥之林。抑爲國家開源致富事業之一。因此。醫學博士兼藥學士褚民誼。醫學博士兼理科博士宋梧生。乃不惜犧牲一部份精神與時間。商諸敎育界先進李石曾蔡元培。曁上海新藥同業公會。共同發起組織一藥學院。期有以造就中國之藥學人才。爲設廠自製新藥之準備。以杜漏巵而利民生焉。</p>
<p>（二）創辦經過　民十八年春。敎育界先進。李石曾。褚民誼。宋梧生等。擬創設一藥學院於上海。乃與藥業界領袖黄楚九。袁鶴松。屠開徵。潘瑞堂諸人商談。一致深表同情。並允力予贊助。嗣遇蔡元培氏。亦頗贊成此舉。當由李氏商得北平中法大學校董會之同意。月予補助二千五百元。作爲經常費。由上海新藥同業公會助洋萬元。中法敎育基金委員會撥助五萬元。合計六萬元爲開辦費。共推李石曾。蔡元培。褚民誼。宋梧生。屠開徵。袁鶴松。周邦俊。黄裕生。章顯達等九人組織董事會。籌備設立。定名私立中法大學藥學院。舉褚民誼氏爲學長。宋梧生氏爲敎務長。十八年秋。覓定校址。釐訂章程。呈報敎育部備案。敎育部以藥稱學院。不符大學組織法。旋令改稱私立中法大學藥學專修科。迄二十一年夏。部令取消董事會。完全隸屬北平私立中法大學。學長改稱主任。以合大學規程。卽由中法大學校董會呈請敎育部立案。並增加經常費月至四千元。同年十一月。部派員視察。認該科主要課程。尙能注重實際。師生工作。皆極勤奮。惟圖書儀器設備。惜厄於經濟。未能充分發展耳。敎育部據報批准暫予立案。關於圖書儀器。限一年之内改進。至二十三年春。敎育部再度派員視察。印象頗佳。訓令准予正式成立案。</p>

<h3 id="c199">讀了「創作與時間的異議」以後 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 黄懷白</p>
<p>上月十九日，止水先生在本刋上，發表了一篇關於拙作「創作與時間」的異議，在這異議裏面，有不少和我相反的意見，這是很值得感謝的。本來，一件事理的眞相，是仁者見仁，智者見智，倒也不必强異爲同。不過眞理是愈辨愈明的，我覺得止水先生的異議中，不免有些地方，近於穿鑿和臆斷，所以得再說幾句：</p>
<p>止水先生劈頭提起希臘的三位悲劇家丨伊士奇，索福克利和由里披底。大致說『他們三人所作，各有八九十部以至百餘種。不能不說是「多産」了罷，然而未嘗因此而不「偉大」。』但我們要知道的是這三位悲劇家所作各有八九十部的話，不過是一種傳說。其實，伊士奇和索福克利的作品，現存者，每人祗有七篇，由里披底的作品，現存者，也祇有十八種。止水先生自己覺得抬出這三位希臘的悲劇家，作爲「多産」的證據，究竟不大可靠，所以他説：『但希臘倒底太古了，希臘的「歷史」，總有點「神話似的」，算不得好證據。』他認爲可靠的證據是舉出司各德，大仲馬，巴爾札克，托爾斯泰和左拉一班人來，以證明「多産」是無害於「偉大」的。不過這裏我們所不能忽略的是司各德等所以能博得「多産」和「偉大」作家雙料的頭銜，他們的寫作態度，是否「太隨便」？他們對於作品，是否「拆爛污」？他們所獲得的雙料頭銜，是否以「長時間的努力和心血去換得來的？」先看司各德吧，他是負了鉅大的債額，所以不得不過度工作來謀償還。他工作的辛勤，是無間晝夜畢生不懈的。在臨死的前一年，還在努力寫他的卜斯的美女（Fair　Maid　of　Perth）。巴爾札克是和司各德同病相憐，天天被債主催逼的。他每天半夜裏就起床，開始寫作，白天又要到印刷處去校稿，他是一個最辛苦的「精神勞動者」。左拉的羅貢馬惹爾叢書（RougonMacquart），也費了二十餘年的精力纔寫成的。根據這些事實，所以我敢說：止水先生所舉的司各德等在文壇上的榮譽，都是經過長時間的努力和辛苦獲得的。他們對於每種創作，寫的時候，態度都極其愼重，並非率爾操觚的「急就章」啊。不過，一個作家要想「多産」與「偉大」兼而有之，究非一件容易事情。所以現在還有人批評司各德作品裏内在的情緒和思想，都不十分眞實，左拉在描寫的技術上，也犯了拖沓累贅的毛病。這些大作家因爲「多産」的關係，尙且不免微疵，其他更可想而知了。所以我們可以這樣說：旣「多産」而又「偉大」的，那是最上乘，其次是寗闕毋濫，最下的要算是「務多而不求精」的作家了。</p>
<p>止水先生說：『我們讀哥德的傳，就知道他並不是「五十年」專弄那「浮士德」。』這是自然，哥德也和我們一樣是食烟火的人，這「五十年」佔了他生命的大半世，他也和我們」樣需要生活。他寫「浮士德」時，也還是住在和我們同一地球上面寫的，關於這地球上面人事的糾纏，當然也不能完全擺脫，至少吃飯，睡眠，讀書，談話也要分了他的一部時間去了。我所說的他費了五十年時間寫成浮士德，也祗能說是「大致」如此，並非在這五十年中，絕對的手不停揮筆不離紙啊。止水先生把這「五十年」眞看得有些「死板板」似的了。</p>
<p>止水先生最後說我「撇開了作家的生活經騐等等不問，專從「創作與時間」的死板板的關係上來作論斷，這是難使現在作家們心服的。」又說我「舉的例子以及對於現在作家的指摘看來，不能不說他的觀念只限於死板板的時間關係。」這些話是止水先生憑着個人的臆斷來發揮的。我在「創作與時間」的文章裏，何嘗說到「創作」祇要有「充分的時間」而就可以抛却其他條件呢？創作所需要的條件，當然是有很多種的。豈特如止水先生所說「生活經騐」，「觀察」和「思想，」而已？還有「想像」，「感情」和「描寫的技巧等，這是可以訴諸「常識」而知道的，不過我的意思是「充分的時間」也是創作的重要條件之一罷了。因爲我那篇文章題目是「創作與時間」，所以我祇表明「時間」對於「創作」的重要，關於生活經騐等軼出本題的話，當然無提起的必要了。因爲我没有提起，止水先生就說我的觀念，只限於時間關係，對於其他撇開不問，這不是憑空臆斷嗎？</p>
<p>「臆斷」是可以抹煞别人的意見，於辨論或批評時但憑「臆斷」固屬是一種最便當的方法，然而，這究竟是太危險了丨所以好的批評家，對於這種武器丨臆斷，還是不敢輕於嘗試的。</p>

<p>蚌壳生羅漢不過同樣的事，佛敎徒們提到蚌，吃了怕罪過，白白地放生又覺不合算；於是多事尋開心，把鉛鑄些小羅漢，用錫黏在蚌壳内部，再放入水，蚌在水裏繼續生活，久而久之，蚌壳長厚，鉛質的羅漢上也塗上一層蚌壳質；若是没破綻，猛然看來，當認爲是天生成的。</p>

<p>病里，一點點小事情竟也會觸起無端的憤怒。</p>
<p>在昨天，因煩不過妻那死氣拚命地勸誘，才勉强着吃下那付瀉藥（心里已是有些不高興）。快到傍晚的時候就不住勁兒地瀉起肚來；并且越閙越凶，雖是口很渴了，但祇是嚥口水的閒空都不易得。幸而挨過了前半夜才漸漸得停止在。心里已經是積滿了恚怒。可是等到躺在床上，却疲乏得什麽都顧不得了。</p>
<p>今天醒來恰正是十點半了。神志確已清醒不少。口燥得厲害，肚里也感覺餓了。不過，一看見妻正在靠床沿立着朝我發楞，昨夜滿腔的恚怒，就不自主地擁上心頭。可是當她見了我醒來，就趕緊一面遞過一杯茶水，一面温柔的問道：「現在好些嗎？給先喝口水潤潤嗓子吧。」</p>
<p>這樣，倒敎我不好發作了。祗好喝着茶，想方法來難爲她：「唔，有什麽可吃的東西嗎？」</p>
<p>因爲我明明的知道現在家里是連一個銅子也没有；而且，昨天早飯時她就對我說了：道頓飯算把剩下的那點麵吃光啦，至於米罐里在三天前就掃淨底的。</p>
<p>果然，聽了我這一問的她，立刻顯出躇躊和爲難的樣子。於是我乘勢更緊接着催促她；「快點呀！楞在那兒幹嗎？不曉得瀉過一夜肚子得吃些東西嗎？」我一面說着，一面注意地釘住她丨丨看她將怎樣來解决這個難題。這時候，我早就忘掉那做丈夫的對於自己的妻子所應盡的責任義務了。</p>
<p>然而，太出乎我的意料之外；我的話剛一打住，眞没想到她却連方才那個躇躊的神色也没有了；反是更温和的微笑着，應聲「是」就轉身走出屋子。隨後，我分明的聽見她開閉大門的聲音，自然這使我頓時猜疑起來，預料她不是去給我賒賬便一定又是給我挖債了丨丨這那里像誠心和我過日子！於是在心里。憤怒的火燄，就更加增長得彷彿一座待爆炸的火山。</p>
<p>等到我再次聽見門響的時候，妻提着兩個粉色紙包笑嘻嘻的回來了。我忍不住劈頭給她一句：「方才你去幹嗎來？」</p>
<p>顯然她是爲我這過大聲而驚愕了。她這才注意到我面部的不快神氣；不過她又完全誤會了：「敎你等急了嗎？我出去給你買點心的。」她把那紙包擱在我的床頭，仍是微笑着，說：「吃吧，上頭這包是鷄蛋糕，下面的是南八脆。我曉得你是喜歡吃這些的，所以我在二伯的舖里賒丨丨」</p>
<p>「又是賒的！」我更厲聲地截斷她的話。隨着她就變成那樣怯怯地：「能不是？家里不是没……」</p>
<p>這時候，在我那早就乘機待炸的火山開始爆裂了。</p>
<p>「得得，家里没錢我可以不吃呀！……那莫貴的東西在咱村里，有錢人害病都不見得肯當飯吃的。何况我們？……爲着吃偏可以厚起臉皮，當然，你是不覺什麽的，可是，那是給我挖孔，丢着是我這個人呀！……難道說，一個人能愛吃什麽吃什麽，那我愛吃的東西多着吃，祇怕的是吃不起………歸根是怨二伯丨丨怨他偏要在這里開點心舖！……」</p>
<p>「其實，我又何嘗不明白，我待你本没過半點好處，………你和我故意閙蹩扭，你並不願意我病好！……」</p>
<p>當每一次我這樣的閙開脾氣來，一時是很難抑制住的；同時，在每會遭到我這樣刻毒呌駡後的妻，她都是一句話不說，祇有坐在旁邊悲哀地抽搐。這一次更没例外：妻又祇是抽搐着不說話；而在病中極度煩燥了的我，怒火旣噴發開了越發是不容易收住。</p>
<p>這樣，一直到快要掌燈的當兒，加重的病痛向我猛烈地襲來了。經過一陣陣喪失知覺的昏暈後，這才算消滅了那無端的怒火。妻紅腫着眼圈又慌張地爲我張羅了。</p>

<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>希望着有一次愉快的海行，而直到這番回國的途中，康脫羅梭郵船在平滑如鏡的印度洋面上疾駛着。它是有着一禮拜直達上海的速率的丨丨我是說，從星加坡。</p>
<p>在記憶里彷彿是中秋：如果不是的話，爲什麽有那麽明朗的月亮呢？</p>
<p>秋天的海上是少風浪的。離開星加坡已經有兩天的海程了：海水愈來愈黑，站在甲板上望着那蒼茫的一片，你可以想像到水的深度。我愛在大清早趁人們未曾醒來的時候悄悄地跑到船頭去看日出；一輪血紅的太陽猛地從海底滾了上天似地，你猜罷，那不是够味的奇蹟麽？我也愛在寂寞的夜間，獨自坐在甲板上聽軋軋的機聲，看銀色的月亮。那時節我比現在更年輕，更不懂事故；也許是這緣故罷，意大利水手就格外地喜歡我，空下來的時候常常凑我去瞎扯。那肥猪樣的一位因爲說得一些英國話，我們在一起的時候就最多。他儘是捧着墨沙里尼在我的面前誇耀，他説這法西斯的領袖是世界第一偉人。</p>
<p>丨丨唸過墨沙里尼的自傳嗎？</p>
<p>有一次，他忽然問到這麽一本書了。</p>
<p>丨丨没有。</p>
<p>我搖搖腦袋。</p>
<p>丨丨在我們意大利，每一個青年都唸過這本書的。知道嗎，墨沙里尼是世界第一偉人哪！</p>
<p>可是我並不怎樣興奮。你想想；一個殖民地生長下來的僑生會有很好的政治意識嗎？那些統治者眞聰明呢，他們有法子使你什麽也不懂得的。做了好幾年敎會學校的善良學生，唸過許多我主耶蘇的書，我却終於海底出太陽的奇蹟似的走開了丨丨現在，我在印度洋上。</p>
<p>有着未來的憧憬的人總是愉快的：何况秋天的海上，並無風濤險惡使你害怕呢？</p>
<p>而又是「月到中秋分外明」的時刻哪！那天夜里我帶了Ukalele獨自坐在船頭。浪沫衝擊着船舷，發出刺耳的聲音。此外什麽都靜寂下去了；世界上儘有愚蠢的人的；睡在悶人的艙房里的不全將良宵辜負了嗎？</p>
<p>奇怪的是我撥着弦綫而唱不出一句什麽；難道那些愛在椰子樹下吟唱的曲子全忘記了嗎？月亮瀉在海上，反射着銀色的光。風是有着秋意的了，穿着單衣的我覺得有點冷意。知道距離我那古老的故國已經漸漸近了；不曉得怎麽一來興奮得只想大聲高喊起來丨丨喊什麽呢？年輕人永遠是那麽容易把理性抛到海底里去的。</p>
<p>我怎能忘記印度洋上的海行呢？在這里，我看旭日東升，我在這雄壯的景緻前面突然勇敢起來！我和墨沙里尼的仰慕者一同談天說地，一同喫那意大利麵包。更是那中秋的月光下，我細細地回想了難忘的椰林故事；同時也考慮了那不可知的未來。……</p>

<p>「什麽膽子不膽子！」壽夫大砲飛起一脚，向冬生瘸手踢來。冬生瘸手抱慣「油撞」的左手，輕輕地把壽夫大砲左脚接住了。壽夫大砲可不怕這一接，身子往冬生瘸手身上一縱；脚從冬生瘸手臂抱裏滑下，站在地上。可是冬手瘸手抱住壽夫大砲大腿死不放。壽夫大砲脫不了身，拳頭像雨點似的往冬生瘸手頭上打下來。冬生瘸手一個「羊頭攻」，壽夫大砲向前一倒，上身壓到冬生瘸手屁股上去，冬生瘸手「羊頭攻」，直穿壽夫大砲胯下而過，把自己頭子叩在路石上；叩出了一臉的血……這麽着，村裏人，多奔了過來，給他們拉開了！</p>
<p>「這可是我的錯嗎？這可是我的錯嗎？」冬生瘸手說到這裏，不禁有點哭音了。「我當了二年鄕警，我没有虧村裏人一絲一毫！我總是遭村裏人駡，但我總還忍着氣，我又遭兵老爺打，區長先生斥責，但我總還忍着氣。我看大生先生面上，我看阿文面上，我是一天挨一天的受苦，但今天，但今天，你們給我評評理看……！」</p>

<p>「這……這個不行的」開暘麻皮阻止着說。「鄕長你不當，還有誰當。壽夫大砲現在吃了糧，回家打鄕警，禀上去，這個責成是要槍斃的。自己村裏人，千萬别那麽做！」</p>

<h3 id="c204">國外市塲之委託貿易問題 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 孔滌庵</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>近數年來我國對外貿易，因受外貨傾銷之影響，入超之勢，與時俱增，今年自一月至八月僅八個月中，進口超過出口者，已達三億六千餘萬元之鉅。苟國人不易其入骨奴化之心理，悉擯不必要之洋貨於不用外，國民經濟總崩潰之期，恐已日薄崦嵫，不久將呈於吾人眼廉矣。惟是國際貿易問題，從消極方面言之，固以杜塞漏巵防遏入超，爲國民應盡之天職；從積極方面言之，則仍以發展出口事業，開拓海外市塲爲切要之圖。邇者振興國外貿易之聲，甚囂塵上，已成爲全國一致之輿論。顧我國今日非特一般商人對於國外市塲情形，懵無所知，即出口貿易之補助機關如輪船，銀行·水險公司等亦多缺焉不備，以言直接貿易，談何容易。故兹略述委託貿易之理論與實際，藉爲縱談及從事出口業者參考之資料焉。</p>
<p>委託貿易Ｃonsignment亦稱寄售貿易，即由貨主將貨物寄送於隔地商人，以支付一定佣金爲條件，委託其代爲推銷之一種方法也。此中委託他人代銷貨物者謂之寄貨人（Consignor或Shipper），受他人委託而爲之銷售貨物者謂之受貨人（Consignee），此種買賣方法，不獨行於國外貿易間，即本國市塲亦頗屬普通，而其所以盛行國際貿易中者理由有二：</p>
<p>（一）欲在外國市塲，推銷各種貨物，雖應與該處需要者直接交易，不經過任何中間商人爲原則；然開設支店，不特需費甚巨，且於該市塲之商業習慣，供需情形，亦難一時全以明瞭，故不如物色就地商家，與之訂立代銷契約，俟將來時機成熟，確足以與該處需要者直接往來，再行改變方針。</p>
<p>（二）凡世界特種貨品，其集散地點，往往有定；如小麥之於倫敦，生絲之於紐約，各國從事斯業者，大都麕集此間，打聽商情，專門代理他人買賣之行紀Commission　Merchant尤屬鱗次鯽比，開設分店，直接從事推銷，勢不足與他人頡頏，不如委託行紀，代爲推銷，轉處於有利地位。</p>
<p>因是之故，在國際貿易之過渡期中，一國經營出口業者，苟自覺缺乏推銷貨物於國外市塲之經騐，大都以利用寄售方法爲原則。歐戰以前，美國出口貨之大部分，多委託英德商行經售，其著例也。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>寄售貨物因委託條件之不同，可分爲二：其一，關於貨物之出售，寄貨人不自指定確實之價目，一任市塲形勢之推移，委託受貨人全權處理者，謂之無制限寄售。Without　Limit反之，銷售之時機·方法·及賣價等，由寄貨人加以種種制限者，謂之制限寄售With　Limit。兩者之利弊得失，在普通商業上，議論甚多；然在國外貿易，彼此遠隔重洋，非特鞭長莫及，難以兼顧，且商情萬變，稍縱即逝，苟受貨人之行紀，確信實可靠，彼自能獨力打算，以最迅速有效之方法，臨機處置，故多採用無制限寄售。惟須注意者，採用此法，如受貨人因急於收回押匯金額之故，不顧市塲形勢如何，任意脫貨，結果致售價遠出於貨主意料之外，而遭虧折，往往而然，故訂立契約時，仍應保持若干條件，方爲妥當。</p>
<p>寄售貿易中之Commission　Merchant,其脫售貨物也，雖以自己之名義爲之，而因不負擔推銷結果所生之損益，故其與寄貨人間，在法律上爲一種委任關係，其權限之大小，則純根據此委任關係而來。普通多訂立合同，一方規定受貨人應就可能範圍内爲寄貨人謀最大之利益，於貨物脫售後即以書函或電報通知寄貨人，並作成帳單連同貨欵匯交之；（但普通寄貨人於發送貨物時，即將該項貨物價欵之一部分向銀行做押匯以取得貨價，）他方則規定受貨人於貨價中，得先扣除墊欵及佣金，蓋墊欵爲代貨主支付之欵項，而佣金則爲受貨人應得之報酬，若不交付，彼自可行使扣留貨物之權利也。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>選擇Commission　Merchant與其他莊號之選擇無異，自以信用確賞爲唯一目標。其最有效方法，雖應由出口業者自身實地考察，或另選派遣員調查，但普通多採用下列方法：</p>
<p>（一）雜誌報章　近數年來，報章中之廣告恒隨其銷路而增加，如申報新聞報不時有關於海外洋商需要我國貨物之記載，雜誌中如實業部國際貿易局發行之工商半月刋，因負有指導開拓海外市塲之使命，凡洋商之欲與華商交易而思購用我國特産品者，悉一一調查其店號貨名營業所等備載之，其他如上海香港漢口等商會發行之商業月報，亦多載有此項廣告。</p>
<p>（二）商工業人名簿　俗亦稱電話簿，世界最著名而發行最久之商工業人名簿，首推英國出版之Kelly'Dicechory　of　Morchants　Lsinufaeturers　and　Shipper　of　the　World，每年發行一次，舉凡世界各地著名之商人進出口業工廠銀行保險公司及輪船公司等，無不一一備載，並附有營業别及所在地别之索引，以便檢閱。其他如英國發行之Dean's　Export　MerchantShippers，荷蘭發行之Adresboek　Van　Nederland,意大利發行之Annuaris　d'ltalia'，瑞典發行之Severiges　Idandelrs　Kalander，挪威發行Norges　Handels　Kalender，日本發行之International　Trade　Developer，瑞士發行之Annuaire　du　Commerce，比利時發行之Annuairede　Commerce及葡萄牙發行之Annuaris　Commercial，等亦頗爲詳備，且其中載有廣告甚多，苟訂閱之，必可發見適當之受貨人也。</p>
<p>（三）借助商會　商會中如各地總商會，本負有推廣海外貿易之責，且與各國商會，亦有多少聯絡關係，若將自己所出貨名，買賣條件等通商報告，委託其轉爲物色，自能與以多少之助力。</p>
<p>（四）委託領事館　領事官責在發展商業，我國駐在海外之領事，雖多學識平庸，不知其所司爲何事，然亦頗具扶植商民之熱忱者，苟請求其代爲調查駐在地之市况，或信用卓著之商號，亦不難得相當之效果。</p>
<p>（五）委託往來銀行　我國銀行在海外設有支行者，現雖僅中國銀行一家，然經營國外匯兌業務之各銀行，於世界重要商埠，大都有代理店存在，若委託其轉向介紹，則必能於該地貿業者中，就其信用狀况，營業綱要等舉以相告，再經一度接洽，雙方即可自由通信，從事交易之進行。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>出口貿易中委託國外市塲推銷貨物之形式，就實際情形觀察大抵可分爲下列四種：</p>
<p>（一）製造業者將其所出貨品，直接裝送於外國中心市塲，委託該處進口商銷售之。</p>
<p>（二）由本國出口商，受製造業者委託，將其貨品運抵外國中心市塲，以製造業者自己之風險及計算，轉託該市塲之進口商銷售之。</p>
<p>（三）出口商因圖擴張銷路起見，利用國外市中饒有信用之行紀，委託其代爲銷售。</p>
<p>（四）出口商因開拓新市塲起見，姑以試售之意思，委託該地進口商銷售。</p>
<p>此四者中第一種之製造業者直接委託外國商人銷售，證之各國實例，雖極普通，然對外貿易，不能從輸出手續，收回貨欵及往來交涉方面觀察，均非有特别之智識與技能不可，製造業者自任推銷，未免諸多窒礙。第二種由製造業者委託出口商後轉委他人推銷，因須支付二重佣金，成本不免加重，殊亦不利。第三種利用出口目的地有力商人，俾得於該市塲中分嘗一臠，佔有相當地位，在産量豐富而該項貨品又具有國際的銷路者行之最宜。第四種最適宜於開拓新市塲，我國自動的對外貿易，方值萌芽，以言寄售，自以採取此種方法最爲適當，所成爲問題者，則應先從何處市塲着手耳？</p>
<p>此理市塲之調查，其在各國，其駐在海外之領事，按月必有詳細之報告，由主管官署發表之，以通告商家，我國則爲領事者大都學識譾陋，政府又不督促之，故海外商情之如何，殊無從窺知底藴。然我國僑民之遠居海外者，僅南洋一帶，其數已達六七百萬人，此等僑胞，除一部分從事體力勞動外，多於其地開設店舖，直接與土人往來交易，從前販賣貨物，以日貨最佔多數，自暴日横佔東北以後，激於義憤，已相率與日人斷絕關係，故其需要國貨甚殷。且此等市塲與我僅一衣帶水之隔，風俗習尙，差與内地相仿，以發展海外貿易，南洋各地，自爲我最適宜之市塲也。</p>
<p>市塲旣經選定，即可就下列各項，如</p>
<p>甲，關於供給方面：</p>
<p>A貨物之生産及製造者，B生産及供給狀况，C競爭品及競爭者，D有無代用品及其優劣如何？</p>
<p>乙，關於需要方面</p>
<p>A需要區域，B用途，C需要季節，D一定期間之需要額。</p>
<p>丙，關於交易方面</p>
<p>如佣金，交貨方法，貨欵收取法，貨物買賣之單位，包裝，及該地之度量衡等。</p>
<p>一一加詳細研究，則一切問題，均可迎刃解决矣，</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>委託貿易直接之當事人爲寄貨人與受貨人兩方，寄貨人旣徵得受貨人同意，而爲之銷售貨物，即應訂立合同，其應注意之事項如左：</p>
<p>（一）佣金之恊定　佣金爲委託貿易中受貨人唯一之收入，縱令貨物脫售後，計算之結果，寄貨人遭受虧折，亦必負責支付，故事先對於費率，不可不於訂立契約中明確規定之。其百分率雖因各地商業習慣之不同，未必一致，普通多依貨物之實際銷售數爲標凖定之；亦有按照發貨單中所開貨價計算之者，蓋糧食水菓等類，經長時間運送後，其中不免發生已行腐敗者，商品檢騐處檢騐後，祗准完好出賣，故如英國利物浦習慣，受貨人所應得之佣金。非以貨物實際之銷售數爲標凖，即檢騐結果被剔去之貨物，亦併作爲銷脫者須付佣金於受貨人，故遇有此種特别習慣地方，其佣金之計算，應於訂約當時明白規定之，庶可免日後之糾紛。</p>
<p>（二）貨欵之保證　寄售之貨物，其經受貨人賒與顧客者，貨欵自不免有拖欠或倒帳之虞，故爲安全計，寄貨人應與受貨人訂立僱客資力保證契約（Delcredere　Contract），俾日後萬一發生危險，可有相當保障，惟締結此種契約後，受貨人責任不免加重，故普通多由寄貨人給與一定之保證佣金Delcredere　Commission，作爲特别報酬，其百分率恒按照市塲習慣决定之。</p>
<p>（三）押匯契約之訂定及其餘額之支付　寄往受貨人之貨物，本屬一種代銷性質，非用受貨人自己承購，則貨欵之支付，就原則言之，自非俟諸貨物售出以後不可。然爲便利寄貨人金融之流通及長保持委託關係起見，故普通受貨人方面嘗允許寄貨人得以發送之貨物爲抵押發行，以自己爲付欵人之匯票，即所謂隨貨匯兌是也。至得做押匯之金額，若僅由寄貨人單方决定，不免爲數過鉅，通例由兩方就發貨單中所開貨價之六七成爲標凖决定之，其餘數應由受貨人歸還於寄貨人，可另定時期及解欵方法焉。</p>
<p>（四）利息之恊定　受貨人對於寄售貨物，一方於其尙未脫售以前，除支付押匯金額外，並須代理寄貨人預墊進口稅·噸稅·棧力·檢騐費·及其他各種雜用，他方貨物脫售後，可就將所得之貨欵，在一定時間内任意利用，故對於寄貨人，同時即發生債權債務關係，爲避日後糾紛起見，雙方應於契約中恊定進出金額之利率，方屬妥當。</p>
<p>以上所述不過將委託貿易中寄貨人之出口商應注意之事項，就其犖犖大端約略言之耳。實則一國國際貿易之推進，其道端在經營出口事業者親立前綫，身赴海外市塲，直接與國外消費者相接觸，而後始足喚發其潛在的欲望，並以排除與我相競爭，則貿易大勢，方有發揚光大之希望。試觀歐戰以後，美國製造業者已易其從前委託德商銷售之心理，而自設海外支店，英人且謂日貨之所以横行無前風靡世界者，其原因厥在其商人之直入他國市塲，而不假手於當地商人，則寄售云者，僅可視爲開拓海外市塲過程中之權宜，而不可作爲常經焉審矣</p>

<p>— 陳鴻根</p>
<p>合作社在我國是一種新興的事業，起源於民國八年，到現在不過十餘年的歷史。始則以一般人民尙未明瞭合作之意義與重要，所以未能普及。當局者雖有提倡合作事業的意志，但因國家多故，顧彼失此，亦屬力有未逮，所以只有任這個出世未久的嬰兒去自謀維護，而合作事業便在這種狀况下苟延了十餘年，這也可算是世界各國合作運動初期的共同現象。可是在漸次演進的過程中，難免不産生了若干法律上的問題，於是合作法規的需要乃日以殷切；所以到了十九世紀的中葉，歐洲各主要國，先後都制定了合作的法規，有的是附屬於普通商法中而不標明合作社之字樣者如法國之合作社法是；有的是雖附於商法中而特表明合作社之名稱，專闢一章爲之討論者如瑞士·比利時·意在利·瑞典等國之合作社法是；另一類是於普通商法以外訂合作社之單行法規者如英國合作法是；其中自以第三類爲最適宜，近來各國制定合作社法多採是種制度。</p>
<p>考我國之有合作社法實導源於民國九年戴季陶先生之産業合作法草案，其後各省市政府鑒於合作事業之日見重要，乃紛紛制定合作法規，前後不下十餘種，兹列於下：</p>
<p>法　　　　　　　　名　　施行地域　施行時期</p>
<p>産業合作社法草案　　　　全國　　　未施行</p>
<p>江蘇省合作社暫行條例　　江蘇　　　十七年七月</p>
<p>上海市消費合作社暫行通則上海市　　十七年十月</p>
<p>山東合作社暫行章程　　　山東　　　十八年十一月</p>
<p>浙江省合作社規程　　　　浙江　　　十八年十二月</p>
<p>南京市合作社暫行章程　　南京市　　仝右</p>
<p>林業合作社章程　　　　　廣東　　　仝右</p>
<p>江西省合作社暫行條例　　江西　　　十九年二月</p>
<p>河北省合作社暫行條例　　河北　　　十九年四月</p>
<p>漢口市合作社暫行章程　　漢口市　　十九年七月</p>
<p>湖南省合作社暫行規程　　湖南　　　廿一年三月</p>
<p>剿匪區内農村合作社條例　農村　　　廿一年十月</p>
<p>以上所舉皆屬局部的合作法規，其内容或襲自日本，或互相模擬，類多不能完備。值兹合作事業方興之際，正需要一種統一的法規使合作事業得歸入於正當統一的途徑；而我國之合作法規竟如此的零亂分比，各行其是，對於指導上及統馭上各方面都感覺困難，合作事業的前途也就産生了障礙，政府也認識了這事體的重大，遂於二十年五月由實業部制定農村合作社暫行規程，冀其能通行全國，但結果各省與地方遵行的非常之少，且以此項規程係由部令公布，未經過立法院審核通過及國民政府正式公布之手續，於立法之程序稍有遺漏，是否具有充分推行之效力，亦屬疑問。依此，中央政治會議乃於民國廿一年九月議决合作社法十大原則，立法院更據此原則，起草一合作社法草案，凡九章八七條，於同年十一月經立法院經濟委員會審查會加以修正，删爲九章七十六條，由中央政治會議通過，並經國民政府於二十三年三月一日正式公布名曰合作社法，其内容各點業經專家一再推敲，當較之以前各省市所行之法完備多多，並且其中有數點優越之處，爲他國合作社法之所未備，惟以我國合作事業經騐尙淺，制法者或依傍成例，或出之臆斷，難免有一二可訾議之處，今以鄙見所及，擇其重要之點加以析論，其中或有一偏之見，亦所難免，讀者幸指正之。</p>
<p>（一）合作社本質之規定丨丨合作社之有别於普通公司，已不待言，在合作社法中應首先述明合作之本質，以免有其他之營利社團，盜用合作社名義，而取得法律上種種之保護與特權。（如免稅等）。查各國法規中對於此點多未能明切表示，致冒牌的合作社比比皆是，如瑞士合作社法謂一合作社是一種個人集合而成且具有共同的經濟目的組織，一似嫌過於寬泛。我國合作社法第一條「本法所稱合作社，謂依平等原則，在互助組織之基礎上，以共同經營方法，謀社員經濟之利益，與生活之改善，而其社員人數及資本額均可變動之團體。」此種規定，可以帮助一般人明瞭合作社之本質，凡冒名影射之營利組織，亦可劃别。所以我認爲這點實是我國合作社法一大特色。</p>
<p>（二）合作社業務與責任之表明丨丨依合作社法第一章第五條之規定「合作社之業務及責任，應於名稱上表明之。」如云「秣陵鎭雙陵鄕農業生産利用運銷有限責任合作社」共有二十一字之多，有人以爲名稱過於冗長，讀起來頗不方便，農民更難以了解其意義，董時進先生謂合作社命名的方法，最好是按實際的職務决定，如云灌溉合作，耕地整理合作等名稱，而不必用「生産」「運銷」等正式字樣，我以爲名稱的大部分作用乃是對外的，一方面爲登記的手續，同時使外界對於合作社之業務得一概念，且在中國合作事業的幼稚狀態下，若名稱不能統一，亦非適宜，爲顧全立法與事實便利計，可儘量將名减縮而不損及其概念。如有限責任之後二字即可削去，若兼營數種業務時可取每業務之首字綴成之，如此則前項名稱，可改爲秣陵鎭雙陵鄕農生利運有限合作社」有時「秣陵鎭」三字亦可省去，僅餘十二字矣。</p>
<p>（三）業務之兼營丨凡合作事業初起之國家，從事者以不諳其中詳情，每易失敗，我國合作事業推行的中心是農民與中下級社會，知識旣已不足，合作技能更屬缺乏，難能兼營數項業務，否則徒事虚張，必無補於實際，或竟招損。合作社法第三條規定「合作社之業務得爲本列各欵之一種或數種，」是表明可以兼營的。不過我們需認明事實上的困難，至少在最近數年以内，應當使一合作社之業務不能過於複雜，若謂數種業務之間有聯帶關係而不能分離時，亦可考察其辦理成績與實際情形，而後兼營其他業務，方不致有失敗之虞。總之，政府當局對於合作事業應取一種指導地位，絕非與歐美各國放任情形可比。</p>
<p>（四）關於登記手續丨依該法第二章第八條規定合作社應於召集創立會，通過章程，選舉理事監事，組織社務會後一個月内，向所在地主管機關登記，此處所指章程並未擬定一定式樣與内容以資凖繩，所在地主管機關亦未明訂爲行政機關（如日本）或司法機關（德國）又按第九條規定「主管機關接到前條呈請後，應於十五日内爲准否之批示，」假如眞能施行，亦可樂觀，不過事實上官廳辦事極其遲緩，再有遠省的行政長官，不了解合作之重要，此項登記手續，恐難以如此迅速辦妥，即如河北有若干合作社，雖已經訓練多年，並有華洋義賑會的輔助，至今還未能完成登記手續。他國對於官廳留難登記時，合作社尙可有向高等法院伸訴之權（如英國），而我國合作社法中對於此點無規定，於合作事業之前途，難免稍有障礙。</p>
<p>（五）社員責任丨合作社法第十一條「…無限責任合作社社員，不得爲其他無限責任合作社社員」，從文字上觀察，此條甚爲完備，可以防止跨社份子，使合作社免受損失。但實際情形未必如是，蓋我國農家有别於歐美之小家庭制，父子兄弟聚居於一處，産業多未分析，今若兄弟二人皆達合法年齡，而分别加入甲乙二合作社爲無限責任社員，則於其中之一社發生損失將全部財産提出賠償後，其他一社如再發生損失時應如何處置，實爲一大問題。且以年來信用合作最爲發展，社員每有冒名跨社以求貸欵之事，此種現象。與立法上以决大之困難，不可不加以防止之策。</p>
<p>（六）社員認購股額與每股金額丨依十五條規定「社員認購社股，每人至少一股，至多不得超過股金總股額百分之二十，……社股金額，每股至少國幣一元，至多不得過二十元，」查限制認股額，所以防止少數社員之壟斷，至關於社股金額各國或有定其最高額者（如日本規定每股金額不得過日金五十元），我國併限制其最低額。我認爲至少有兩個缺點：（一）之伸縮性丨若無最低額，則可以在最高額以下自由活動，社員多時股金可以低，少時可以高，（二）一般工人與農人經濟狀况低落，二元之數，或嫌稍高。</p>
<p>（七）股息丨合作社社股利息，本法規定「最高額不得超過年利一分」合作社社股本，不以給息爲是，如戴氏産業合作社法原則中云「就出資額爲盈餘分配，已非恊作主義之精神」，在一般的公司股息，高者亦不過年息一分，而合作社股息竟亦規定如是之高，誠失合作意義。</p>
<p>（八）社員退社丨各國合作社法多承認合作社社員有要求退出的權利，此次公布之合作社法第二十四條，云「社員得於年度終了時退社，但應於三個月前提出請求書。」是限制在一年之末，始能有退社的機會，退社社員如有遷移較遠之處改就他業者，必感不便。吾意可劃分一年爲二度，即每半年有退社之機會，如此在社方辦事旣未增若干之不便，而於退社社員確能俾益不淺。</p>
<p>（九）合作社監查事項丨關於合作社之監查，各國法律多有明文規定，如英國與印度係受司法機關之檢查，德意志與奥大利是受合作社自治機關「檢查聯合會」之檢查，日本則受行政官廳之監督，吾國在此合作事業盈育時代，也應該倣效這種制度，使得以循軌的發展，而合作社法中除規定内部監事及社員與債權人可以審查財務及業務狀况外，並未規定社外有何種機關監督之條例。</p>
<p>（十）理事責任問題丨第三十五條規定「經營第三條第四欵之業務合作社，不能清償儲金之債務時理事負連帶清償之責。」所謂第三條第四欵業務即係指信用合作而言，此種業務最易招損，法中規定理事有負連帶清償之責，考理事乃由社員大會就社員中選任之，與其他社員無少差異，僅需爲中華民國人民，年滿二十歲，有正當職業有，卽可當選（見合作社法第十條），在此簡單條件之下，欲其負如此重大責任，誠屬可滋疑間，是否理事應同時具有其他條件，（如最低之資産額等）實爲今當討論之問題，不然此項規定亦等於虚設矣。丨</p>

<p>— 淑賢</p>
<p>據江海關統稅科的消息，最近全國各省每年捲烟的消費，除内中常有私製漏稅的情事外，總計每年捲菸的消費額，竟達四萬萬元之鉅云。這驚人的數字與貴國整個的國民數恰好成了一個單位的對比。</p>
<p>中國人對於吸烟這一項似乎特别地感有興趣，而捲菸對於中國人也似乎分外地有緣丨至大人先生，下至在馬路上拾香烟屁股的朋友，老幼男女，無分貴賤，那一個不愛嘴邊含上一枝菸捲兒，雖是菸捲兒的本質「貨有好歹」「價有高低」，但凡烟則皆可吸，不吸烟者似乎不足與人伍，如是依據各人不同的經清情形，造成了這鉅量的消費數目。</p>
<p>烟對於人的身體不但絲毫無益而且有莫大的害處，這道理在進化到現時二十世紀的人們，似乎個個都很能懂得，然而吸烟者却明知故犯，甚至於飯倒可以少吃兩口，而香烟則不能不抽一枝，朋友見面最先的敬禮是一枝香烟，精神枯燥了也是一枝香烟，勞動疲憊了也來一枝香烟，大都市裏的戲院，舞廳，以及各種各色的公娛樂塲所，和各學校團體工廠的馬桶間，普遍地都成了捲菸消費的大本營了！</p>
<p>在下也是一個死愛吸烟的，也曾下過十二萬分的决心戒過兩次烟，但每次至多支持不了十天，不知不覺地無形中又犯了舊毛病，這當然一方面歸究於自己没有毅力，而另一方面也是吸烟已成了社會普遍化的習慣的原故。</p>
<p>烟之宜於要戒，在目前經濟恐慌，生活艱難的時期内，我想是大家公認讚同的，然而究竟怎樣實行戒法却是一個很難解决的問題！鄙意以爲只有自動地以多吸不如少吸，少吸不如不吸，不吸不如永遠不吸的辦法，才能獲很良好的效果！</p>

<p>田裏的稻桿子已變了金黄，農夫農婦們正在忙着收穫他們辛勞汗血所凝聚成的結晶。</p>
<p>吾們終年生活在煩囂都市裏的人，一旦投進了大自然的懷抱裏，彷彿置身在另一個世界裏面了；把生活的勞苦與都市的塵俗，一箍腦兒的擁到了大西洋的對岸，心底裏頓覺澄清了許多。</p>
<p>飄着，飄着；吾沿着黄浦江飄去。兩傍油緑色的荒郊，要不是夾着金黄色的稻桿子，幾乎使吾忘記了這是秋天咧！</p>
<p>江中一隻巨大的江輪，緩緩地向吳淞口外駛去，幾隻汽油船在似箭般的射着，剪開了江面的水，劃破了黄濁的浪，浪花激上塘岸，發出澎湃的聲音。</p>
<p>暮靄籠罩着大地，晚霞緊接着落日，映得盪漾的海波泛出了一片美麗的金黄色，遠處的點點帆影，斜傾着在悠悠的烟波裏前進，幾只孤鶩招着翅膀向天空中衝去。</p>
<p>「落霞與孤鶩齋飛，秋水共長天一色。」這美麗的圖畫呵！只有此時，只有此地，才給吾以賞到，欣然到。</p>
<p>三峽水的塘岸上，擁着一大堆的人，在那裏談笑。這些都是從都市裏擠出來的男女，準備到這裏來换一換清新空氣的。海風在每個人的臉上滑過，衣服給吹得拍拍的作響，女人的頭髮在隨風飄揚；一陣一陣的，把地面上的塵砂捲在空中飛舞。</p>
<p>面前一埭很長的石堤，展露在海面，靜靜地躺在黄濁的波濤中。好多的男女在堤上闖着，吾們脚癢得難傲，所以也終於跳到了堤上，拚命地向前奔去，奔去。然而其崎嶇峻險，比了蜀道還要難行，祇要一不小心，便有滑入海裏去和波臣爲伍的危險！可是看見吾們面前，有四五個摩登密司和密音司在安詳地走着，吾不覺感到了十二分的慚愧！</p>
<p>在石堤的盡頭，燈塔下，坐着兩個女郎，正在褪去浴衣，揩乾身上的水漬，穿上藍士林布的旗衫，但鞋襪還没穿好，像個赤脚大仙般的站着嘻笑。</p>
<p>望着一抹蔚藍的天空，白雲在徐徐地移動，眞像一股輕烟，瞬息卽漸漸地幻滅了。三峽水外停泊着一隻淺藍色的軍艦，没有旗幟，没有火烟，靜靜地，毫没生氣的立着，像個垂斃的老人。怒濤急浪在向石堤上滾來，激出了雄壯的濤聲，浪花浸濕了吾們的衣服。</p>

<h3 id="c215">銀行倒閉 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 欣子</p>
<p>五華銀行剛倒閉得不久，現在中國興業銀行又倒閉了，倒閉的原因，雖皆因爲投機事業的失敗，主持人在捉襟見肘的時候，不得不以一走了之，但是年來因爲經濟呆滯，銀行方面不能正常的發展，於是不得不投資於别一方面，也是一個主要原因。</p>
<p>銀行業方面年來因爲農村經濟破産，現銀集中於都會，而都會的工商業又因不景氣而呈現着衰疲狀態，鑒於這兩個原因，銀行方面的屯銀便日增一日起來，而另外一方面，開支旣不能省，存户的利息又每日加長，要放欵罷，處在這樣市面又怕放了出去收不回來，不放罷，屯在庫裏又大銀子不會生小銀子。層層的困難下，銀行業方面便祇有幹投機事業和投資於實業的二條路了。</p>
<p>第一條路，那是投資於標金公債，甚至麫麥，棉布市塲，憑一己的眼光，將存户的金錢來利用一下，希望在這中間換得利潤，可是那是極危險的一條路，主持者的偶一不愼，便立刻容易全軍覆没的。</p>
<p>第二條路，那是投資於實業，最普遍的現集，那便是自建大厦，一方面將空餘下來的房間出租與人，而另外一方面，旣博得存户的信仰，而本身又多一筆不動産，在這筆鉅額的産業中，用將來的租金來作爲存户的利息以及本身的利潤。</p>
<p>第一條路的危機已如上文所說的了，第二條路呢，也不是正當的路，大厦雖然建立起來了，而庫存的空虚那該是一定的，要是不幸的發生了風潮呢？不是也立刻要被迫休業嗎？並見銀行本身的作用，他是應該調劑社會經濟的，現在費大量金錢於這兩方面，實質上，連自己不也先空虚起來嗎？</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>所以，鑒於眼前的兩銀行的倒閉，以及未來的其他許多銀行的險影可怕，爲了國民經濟的穏固起見，我們應該行積極的與消極的二方面去幹。</p>
<p>積極的，眼前現銀集中都會（說透澈些應該說是集中銀行）那是有關於整個的社會問題的解决的，我們希望當局以及金融鉅頭有良好的計劃出來。</p>
<p>消極的，我們要求銀行公會公開報告所屬會員和非會員的行名，並且切實聲明所屬會員的最後責任，由他們担保，而對於已加入會員，應該不時派員檢查，而對於要求加入的新會員，更應該愼重考慮。</p>
<p>這樣，庶幾不致有使人無所適從之苦，而於國民經濟方面，也不致有大影響發生。</p>
<h3 id="c216">文人與窮 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 愚公</p>
<p>古往今來的文人，假如被社會稱讚他「窮而有志」，大多數引爲足以驕傲的資格。其實眞正是貧窮的文人，那是很少很少。</p>
<p>比如孔門賢人顔回吧，孔子稱讚他，「回也賢，居陋巷無愠色，」看來他是一個貧窮不過的文人了；可是，他有着附郭田三十畝，可以算是一個小地主了。又比如陶淵明這田園詩人，因爲他留傳着有一首乞食的詩，給後人一個印象那是窮詩人，可是他不爲五斗米折腰而回家去的時候，還有歡迎的童僕，將蕪的田園，實際上他是一個不小的地主。</p>
<p>一個朋友告訴我説，古人說窮，是没有做官的意思。</p>
<p>他這話，不知道有没有考證。可是如果根據上面所引的顔回與陶淵明兩人來說，那是確實可靠的了。</p>
<p>再從他這話，引申下去，可見古人做官的就是富人，而官者又名貴人，可見文人一爲官便富貴兩全了。可見這一種思想觀念丨丨陞官發財丨丨古今文人原無二致了。</p>
<p>然而，古人也有一句騙人的話，說是文章「窮而後工」，意思在鼓勵窮文人「安貧知命」，對於物質雖然缺乏，名譽却是更好，但說那句話的人一定不懂窮人的苦境，眞是胡說八道。一個終日在愁衣愁食的人，連寫文章的心緒都没有，那裏來的好文章？這是凡是窮文人都有的經騐。古人欺人之談，現在越想越多，這不過是一個小例子吧了。</p>
<p>再來一個，然而如今的文人，失業可以賣文爲生，却比較失業工人好得多多，這却是窮文人不該怨天尤人的事。</p>

<p>— 拓人</p>
<p>午夜，窗外的樹兒，給那秋風刮得沙沙的在嚮着，巷角的路燈，昏黄的光綫也隨風在波盪着。窗上的紗帘上，很美麗的印上一重重浮沉着的葉影。天空上，就祇是黑越越的沉悶着。</p>
<p>寂寞的心，在這深秋的夜裏，是更加的愁悶了。好像失眠似的，一個個的幻想，就掠過了我的眼前，使我深深地沉入在幻想的夢境裏，去回憶着人生一切悲歡離合的滋味。</p>
<p>沉澱的天，是更加的濃黑了，風也更猛烈的刮着，一刹那間，已經是下起雨來了。呵！秋夜的雨，是帶來了愈濃厚的寒意了。</p>
<p>秋風猛吹着雨，窗上的玻璃，浙瀝的在嚮着，在這深巷裏靜寂的氛圍中，這雨的聲音，是多未的可怕呀，眞好似處在沙漠中的人，聽着狂風的吹吼，那樣的可怕。</p>
<p>很遠地，很遠地，送來了一陣悠沉的歌聲，雜着雨聲的飛進了我的耳朶，把我從幻夢的境地中驚轉來了。好奇地，我探長了頭，向着那玻璃窗外去瞭望着。</p>
<p>漸漸地，那歌聲沉下去了，祇有那竹笛的悠揚的聲音在嚮着。可是那聲音是帶着悲愁的韻調的。一刹那，那女人歌唱的聲音又嚮了，她的歌也是那末悲哀的和着笛聲合奏着。</p>
<p>呵！這是盲女的歌呀，在這深夜的寂靜的巷裏，是顯得格外的凄凉悲楚了。流浪人最怕的是聽到這流浪者的哀歌呀！</p>
<p>雨還在落着，天還是那末的黑沉沉着，我的心，也更加的寂寞，更加的悲哀着。呵！流浪者的悲哀呀！</p>
<p>夜的週遭，是這樣的寂靜，這樣的空虚呵！</p>
<p>盲女的歌聲，終於漸漸地沉遠去了，我的心就感到了一陣陣的空虚！包圍住我的深心的就是更可怕的寂寞了。</p>
<p>呵！流浪的人兒，你的心是祗好永遠的寂寞了。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個受舊式婚姻束縛的痛苦的女子。在幼年時由父母作主嫁給一個國外回來的男子。那時我大約在十六七歲左右，智識非常幼稚，還未想到舊式婚姻的痛苦。婚後二年，尙不覺任何煩惱。後來他說要再到國外謀生，於是天各一方，無從會面。起初他還魚雁時通，不時將我的生活費寄來，詎不久非但不匯生活費用，連信　也很少了。我因生活來源斷絕，便不得不返母家，靠父兄過活。由是三年餘，曾去數函，他祗回一信，說現賦閒異地，還没有找到相當職業，所以不能遵守前約，將生活費寄回云云。我因他雖未覓得職業，而又不返祖國，實在形似遺棄，遂不得已委某律師寫信給他，希望嚴守前約，每月匯寄生活費，否則脫離關係，他覆信很含糊，和前信差不多。現在又請律師寫第二封去，說他如不守前約，彼此惟有離婚。不過他的覆信還没有來。</p>
<p>我現在精神痛苦萬分，不知將來結局如何。兹有下列三題，務懇先生代爲解决。</p>
<p>（一）在三年之外，彼方不供給生活費，可自行登報聲明脫離關係及婚嫁自由？此事對法律有碍否？</p>
<p>（二）如上述律師第二封信去後，不候對方覆函，卽自行登報結婚，則上海律師的信，是否能發生「離婚」效力？</p>
<p>（三）倘不離滬，能否訴請對方補還前欠之生活費及損失費。</p>
<p>敬頌　撰安　碧雲上</p>
<p>編者按：所訊問題，在法律上是不能成立的，並且有許多困難情形，兹分别解答於下：</p>
<p>（一）生死不明逾三年者，構成訴請離婚之原因：但必須向法院起訴，經判决離婚，方爲合法。若由一方登報聲明離婚是不合法的，故無效。並且不供給生活費用，祇可告其惡意遺棄，亦爲訴請離婚之理由，然非生死不明。</p>
<p>（二）未經合法的離婚手續而另與他人結婚者，犯重婚罪。登報與律師之通告信，均無離婚效力。蓋離婚除雙方同意，不問任何原因均可恊議離異外，若爲一方之意思，則非有法定之原因而經法院之判决者外，不生效力。</p>
<p>（三）不離滬而訴請離婚則可，但須對方亦爲上海人，否則上海法院即無管轄權。至於補還生活費與賠償損失，當看有無充分之理由爲斷。</p>

<h3 id="e9">The Exchange of Notes Between China and the United States on the Silver Question is Published <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The United States is Willing to Pay Close Attention to the Opinions of the Chinese Government</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi Declares Gratitude for This</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After consultations between the Central Government and the United States government, the recent exchange of notes between the National Government and the United States government has been published. When publishing these notes, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi declared that he expressed gratitude to the United States authorities for their willingness to take into account the opinions put forward by the Chinese government to the greatest extent possible within the scope of the Silver Purchase Act, and for their willingness to jointly consider other more important issues with Chinese representatives. The content of the exchange of notes is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Note from Shi Zhaoji, Chinese Ambassador to the United States, to the United States government, dated September 23, 1934: China, as a major silver standard country, believes that silver is more important to China than any other country. Now that the United States is implementing the Silver Purchase Act, I am supplementing the opinions of the previous informal note. Since 1931, the price of silver has risen due to the devaluation of foreign currencies, and China has had to undergo serious inflation and suffer economic losses. Moreover, China's balance of payments, at least in part due to hindered exports, has also deviated from the norm. Recently, the price of silver in foreign countries has been greatly stimulated, but there has been no corresponding response in exchange rates, resulting in a shocking outflow of large amounts of silver. Silver exports this year, to date, have been three times the total annual amount of previous years. If the price of silver rises again, China will suffer extremely great damage, or there may be a possibility of panic. Therefore, although various influential parties in the United States advocate raising the price of silver, the Chinese government cannot agree with the United States policy. China is aware that the United States government very much wants to avoid actions that would increase the difficulties of the current situation, so it hopes to obtain a guarantee that the United States government will not take actions that would cause silver to flow out of China again, and will cooperate with China to prevent silver prices from rising and maintain balance in accordance with the original intention of the London Silver Agreement. In China's opinion, the stable price of silver should still be slightly lower than the current price. The Chinese government, with its responsibility, must find ways to avoid the damage caused by fluctuations in silver prices. It is now believed that China should not maintain the silver standard alone, so it has considered gradually adopting a gold standard currency, and therefore must absorb cash. Now that the United States government wants to increase the ratio of silver reserves in the national treasury, the Chinese government also wants to know whether the United States government is willing in principle to exchange gold and silver with the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Reply from the United States government to the Chinese government, dated October 12, 1934: I apologize for the late delivery of the reply dated September 22. I have spoken with the Chinese Ambassador to the United States and explained in detail the attitude of our government towards the two notes from China. During the conversation, I tried to express the original intention of our government's silver purchase plan. This plan was decided by Congress and ordered the government to implement it. As for the methods taken during implementation, the government has the power to act as it sees fit, but it must proceed in accordance with the goals of the plan. Our government very much hopes that when implementing this plan, it will have universal benefits, resulting in stable silver prices, and avoid, to the greatest extent possible, disturbing China's economy and public finances. Therefore, while our government must implement congressional laws, it is also willing to pay close attention to the opinions of the Chinese government and adjust the timing, location, and quantity of silver purchases. Currently, gold and silver purchases can be carried out in the open market of each country, so direct transactions between governments have not been implemented. However, friendly discussions can be held in the future, and since both countries now have a common desire to achieve a common system, our country is very willing to discuss these larger issues with your country's representatives at any time. (14th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Huainan Coal Mine is one of the projects sponsored by the Construction Commission. It was prepared in the 18th year of the Republic to develop the Shungengshan Coal Mine in Huaiyuan, Anhui, with a total mining area of 220,000 acres. In the spring of the 19th year, the Huainan Coal Mine Bureau was established, first establishing East and West plants in the Jiulonggang District, each plant opening two vertical shafts. At present, only more than 1,000 tons are produced daily, but the coal reserves are very rich, with a total thickness of up to 12 meters. The Jiulonggang mining area contains 71.7 million tons, and the Dongshan coal area contains 43.7 million tons, with a total of 115.4 million tons in both areas. In any case, Huainan coal should have at least 50 million tons. The coal quality is high-volatile bituminous coal, suitable for low-temperature coking and oil refining. If mixed with a small amount of low-volatile bituminous coal, it can be refined into good metallurgical coal. In terms of coal quality, its calorific value is high, comparable only to Fushun coal. In terms of transportation, it is less than half the distance of Zhongxing from the Yangtze River. After railway transportation is established, the cost will be reduced, and extremely cheap fuel will be supplied for domestic agricultural, industrial, and commercial use, which will be beneficial to national defense and heavy industry. Currently, a 12-kilometer light railway has been laid from the mine to Luohe (a tributary of the Huai River), equipped with dozens of large and small locomotives and coal cars. Dozens of self-owned steamships, gasoline boats, and iron barges are also available from Luohe to the Bengbu waterway, specializing in transportation. In terms of business operations, coal plants have been established in Luohe, Bengbu, and Pukou, and offices have been established in Xiaguan to handle business operations and transportation. Because there is no space available at the Pukou railway wharf to store large quantities of coal, a branch depot wharf company has been jointly organized with Zhongxing, Lieshan, Huadong, Huafeng, and Datong, with a capital of 1.6 million yuan, of which the Huainan mine accounts for one-eighth of the shares. The wharf is under construction. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Our society has a traditional, morbid phenomenon. Those who receive higher education always adopt the habits of scholars and officials of the past. They are often physically inactive and ignorant of agriculture. Conversely, farmers and laborers who work hard and engage in production are often regarded as uneducated people. This was the case in the past during the imperial examination era, and it remains unchanged even with the abolition of the examinations and the rise of schools. Its impact is indeed significant. The effectiveness of past education, judging solely by its contribution to national welfare and the people's livelihood, is virtually zero. The lifestyle of the 20th century is incomparable to that of the 15th and 16th centuries. Moreover, a nation claiming to be modern cannot survive by relying on outdated production methods. Therefore, as time goes by, the crisis becomes more apparent. Today, our country faces national difficulties, with everything waiting to be rebuilt, and the people are bewildered, not knowing where to turn. In fact, the crux of the problem is not difficult to discern. It still lies in the fact that education has not been put on the right track. In recent years, the call for production education has been rampant. However, the spirit of production and construction, "sufficient to enrich national welfare and the people's livelihood, quell internal strife, and resist foreign aggression," is still rarely seen in education. Generally, students, influenced by traditional habits, become like the scholars and officials of the past without even realizing it. However, apart from a few lucky individuals, they lack the connections to seek official positions and the skills to find employment. The phenomenon of graduation leading to unemployment has been exposed nationwide, further burdening the nation and society.</p>
<p>Enlightened people within the country, feeling this deeply, have collectively attributed it to the errors of past education. They have jointly proposed that future education should be guided by production. Education authorities have also begun to focus on adding and expanding practical subjects such as science and engineering, while reducing courses in literature and law, as a means of adjustment. Their intention is that if young students can acquire production skills, they will certainly be needed by our country's society, where "hundreds of industries are waiting to be revived, and everything is waiting to be rebuilt," when they leave school in the future. For young individuals, this can ensure opportunities for service, and it will also greatly benefit the overall national welfare and the people's livelihood. However, in my humble opinion, I feel that the reality may not be so. It is undeniable that our society is in a state where "hundreds of industries are waiting to be revived, and everything is waiting to be rebuilt." However, before these industries are revived and rebuilt, how can we accommodate a large number of young people with new production skills? If those who reform education in the future only focus on cultivating young people's production skills without addressing the issue of where to place talents after their skills are developed, the result will only be the creation of a large number of highly educated unemployed vagrants. If young students, after completing their studies, still cannot avoid being displaced and wandering about, then what is the point of us expecting production education to remedy the national welfare and the people's livelihood? Do we not see that many students who study science and engineering abroad, after returning to the country, are unable to enter the industrial sector to display their talents and instead become teachers in schools to make a living? The lessons from the past are not far away, and we should learn from them.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most crucial issue in our country's education today is not only whether students have the opportunity to acquire production knowledge while studying, but also whether students can practically apply their acquired knowledge after graduation to independently create new opportunities. In other words, the highest goal of running education in our country in the future should be to cultivate talented individuals who are astute, capable, and independently entrepreneurial, and it should not be enough to merely cultivate students' production skills. Only in this way will young people not only avoid panic after leaving school due to the lack of social opportunities but also be able to automatically start their own businesses, thereby driving the giant wheel of social evolution.</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly a difficult task. However, there is a passive but necessary prerequisite that we can strive for and implement today. This is to break the traditional habits of scholars and officials. If these habits can be broken, then students will fundamentally have no base thoughts of relying on the old environment to seek wealth and glory. On the one hand, they will be unwilling to accept the protection of evil forces, and on the other hand, they will be unable to withstand the oppression of the old environment. When driven to their wits' end, they will surely break through and find their own path. If students in the future can maintain the virtues of the farming and laboring classes in adapting to the old environment, and also combine them with the courage and knowledge to resist the old environment, then a multitude of independently entrepreneurial talents can emerge. Those who bear the mission and great ambition of reforming education, should they first break the thousands of years of lax and complacent habits of scholars and officials by setting an example themselves? I look forward to it.</p>
<h3 id="e36">French Cabinet Reorganization: Entire Collapse Averted; Minister of Justice Forced to Resign; Laval Appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) After a heated cabinet meeting, the government was on the verge of complete collapse. Today, Minister of Justice Chéron submitted his resignation, which was accepted by Prime Minister Doumergue. He indicated that a successor would be decided next week. Chéron's resignation was the result of intense criticism in the press following the assassination of the King of Yugoslavia, which brought up the Stavisky affair and the Prince assassination case. It is said that during the cabinet meeting, several ministers insisted on Chéron's resignation, otherwise they would dissolve the coalition cabinet. After accepting Chéron's resignation, Prime Minister Doumergue announced that the cabinet reorganization would be completed by the end of next week. The vacancy left by Foreign Minister Barthou has been filled by Colonial Minister Laval, and Laval's vacancy has been filled by Piétri. Doumergue also announced that the position of Minister of Interior has been filled by Marchandeau, succeeding Sarraut. Therefore, the only unfilled position is that of Minister of Justice. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Balance of Power Among Parties Unchanged; French President Leads Ministers of Army, Navy, and Air Force to Yugoslav Capital to Attend Funeral <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) This partial cabinet reorganization maintains the balance of power among the parties in the "Party Truce Cabinet" without any changes. Prime Minister Doumergue explained this at today's Council of Ministers, stating that he could have appointed Minister without Portfolio Herriot or Tardiou as Minister of Foreign Affairs, as they would have been able to handle the position well. However, he preferred that both remain as Ministers without Portfolio, leading their respective political friends to support the cabinet's actions. In addition, he had considered asking Minister of Public Works Flandin to become Minister of Foreign Affairs, as Flandin has extensive experience in foreign negotiations. However, in the end, it was decided to appoint Laval as Minister of Foreign Affairs because Laval had previously served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and had undertaken important missions to Berlin and Washington. He has served as various ministers and even as Prime Minister, accumulating countless experiences, making him the most suitable person for the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs. As for the resignation of Interior Minister Sarraut, the Prime Minister and President expressed their appreciation. His vacancy was filled by Marchandeau, a member of the Chamber of Deputies of the Radical Socialist Party. Marchandeau had served as Secretary-General of the Council of State during the Steeg and Herriot cabinets and as Minister of Budget in the Chautemps cabinet. Furthermore, after Laval's transfer to Minister of Foreign Affairs, the vacancy of Colonial Minister was filled by former Minister of Commerce Rollin, as the colonial economy is closely related to the mother country's commercial policy. Rollin's past experience can help solve the economic difficulties of the colonies. The Council of Ministers unanimously passed the above cabinet reorganization plan. After the cabinet was reorganized, Minister of Justice Chéron submitted his resignation. Chéron stated that the various accusations from the outside world were directed at him personally and were all absurd and inappropriate. However, the political reform work has not yet been completed and is urgent. He did not want to hinder the Prime Minister's progress due to him alone. Therefore, he submitted his resignation. Prime Minister Doumergue thanked Chéron for his loyal cooperation and approved his resignation. However, given the current environment, the position of Minister of Justice is extremely important. Therefore, the Prime Minister believes that a successor cannot be decided before Monday. If a suitable candidate cannot be found among the senators, the Prime Minister intends to select a prominent judge as Minister of Justice. For example, Chief Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, Madec, is one of the people the Prime Minister has in mind. (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon's Council of Ministers was chaired by President Lebrun. After announcing the opening of the meeting, the President delivered a speech commemorating the great French statesman, the late Foreign Minister Barthou, and recounted his achievements in diplomacy. Prime Minister Doumergue then thanked the President and assured him that the cabinet would resolutely continue the tasks already underway. The Council of Ministers subsequently decided that President Lebrun, along with Minister of Army Pétain, Minister of Navy Piétri, and Minister of Air Force Denain, would go to Yugoslavia to represent France at the funeral of King Alexander of Yugoslavia. Minister of Air Force Denain will lead a squadron of French aircraft to Yugoslavia. Next, Interior Minister Sarraut stated that after the Marseille tragedy, he had dismissed the chief of the detective squad, Bédouin, and removed him from his official rank. The prefect of Bouches-du-Rhône, Jouhannaud, was dismissed and placed on probation. The chief inspector of the detective squad in charge of handling officials' travel affairs, Cestreton, was dismissed. However, the Interior Minister himself was negligent in his management and should take the blame. Therefore, in addition to submitting his resignation to the Prime Minister two days ago, he now personally tendered his resignation at the Council of Ministers. Sarraut also said, "The reason why a leader is a leader is that he must take responsibility. Even if the leader leads his subordinates to fulfill their duties, if a major tragedy that the public detests occurs, the leader is still blameworthy. If I bear the blame and am not punished, my conscience will not be at ease. Therefore, I must submit my resignation to you." Finally, he said that although he was retiring, he would still be loyal to peace and repay Prime Minister Doumergue's kindness as a private citizen. Although there was some regret in this request for retirement, he was quite honored. Prime Minister Doumergue repeatedly praised Sarraut, saying that the Interior Minister's resignation was to avoid placing the government in a difficult position, and his generosity was especially appreciated. Thereupon, Prime Minister Doumergue requested the President to sign the appointments of the succeeding cabinet members. As for the resignation of Minister of Justice Chéron, it was not considered at the Council of Ministers, as Chéron had voluntarily submitted his resignation after the Council of Ministers, intending to facilitate the smooth progress of the cabinet's partial reorganization. As for the chief of the National Detective Squad, a successor has not yet been appointed. The vacancy of prefect of Bouches-du-Rhône will be filled during the next prefectural reshuffle. (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Doumergue considered the issue of filling the cabinet vacancy after the resignation of Minister of Justice Chéron this morning. It has now been confirmed that Prime Minister Doumergue intends to invite Senator Régnier, the general rapporteur of the Finance Committee, to assume the position of Minister of Justice. However, so far, he has not yet contacted Régnier himself. Therefore, the new Minister of Justice will not be decided before tonight or tomorrow. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>

<p>Belgrade Yugoslav national patriotic organizations today appealed to the people to unite in a spirit of sacrifice and composure during this time of national mourning, so as not to create unnecessary incidents. Italian expatriates here today also wrote to the Prime Minister of the Yugoslav Cabinet, saying, "All Italian expatriates here express our condolences for the national mourning of the Yugoslav people and express our grief for the tragic death of His Majesty Alexander. We ask you to convey our deep condolences to the Royal Family and the Government." (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Rome Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has strictly prohibited newspapers from broadcasting criticisms of the Marseille tragedy. The Italian Prime Minister believes that if Italy and Yugoslavia do not engage in provocative behavior, the friendly relations between the two countries can be maintained. According to reports, the Yugoslav government protested to the Italian government yesterday because an Italian newspaper broadcast that Yugoslavia was on the verge of disintegration, saying that Yugoslavia regarded this as an unfriendly act. Political circles here also explained the reasons why Italy and Yugoslavia should restrain their rash behavior, saying that Italy and France are now eager to reach a compromise, but Yugoslavia's disputes are likely to undermine it. Therefore, the Italian government cannot tolerate any criticism or rumors that would harm the feelings of the Yugoslav people. News of the Italian army's actions on the Yugoslav border has been firmly denied by the authorities here today. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It has been confirmed by the French General Directorate of Police that the Yugoslav terrorist organization harbored by Hungary, known as the "Babary Pivot," was the instigator of the Marseille tragedy. According to a statement released today by the French authorities, the General Directorate of Police has identified Kalimen Piniés and Hospitch, also known as Novak, through portraits, along with the three fugitives, as members of the organization. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Hungarian Embassy here today issued a statement strongly denying Hungary's involvement in the Marseille tragedy, in which Hospitch, an accomplice of Marseille assassin Kalimen, confessed everything to the French police. The Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also firmly denied the existence of such an assassination terrorist organization in Hungary. However, newspapers here now say that Hungary should bear moral responsibility for the Marseille tragedy. They also say that Hospitch's confession may have serious consequences. The Paris Echo severely criticized the people of Budapest, accusing them of being responsible not only for the Marseille tragedy but also for other recent international misfortunes. Newspapers in Budapest vigorously refuted this statement, saying that while there are political refugees from Croatia living in Hungary, there are also many who have taken refuge in Paris. It is now believed that Kalimen, Hospitch, and the other two who escaped are all members of the refugee organization in Hungary. Yugoslavia protested to the Hungarian government on April 26 about this matter. The Yugoslav government also sent a letter to the League of Nations, saying that Hungary not only tolerated this organization but also helped to establish it. The League of Nations discussed this matter on June 5. At that time, the Hungarian representative complained that shootings occurred on the Yugoslav-Hungarian border, and the Yugoslav representative replied that if we shoot, it is because the opposite side of the border is a real den of bandits.

The destroyer Dubrovnik, carrying the coffin from France, entered the port at 6:00 a.m. this morning. At that time, the sky was slightly bright, and people waiting to welcome him had arrived one after another. All diplomatic representatives in Belgrade, senior government officials, army and navy officers, and tens of thousands of people were silently waiting. The time of the coffin's arrival at the port was announced last night, so people from nearby villages also came here. When the warship entered the port, all the docked warships and surrounding forts fired salutes. British and French warships also participated in the firing, and military aircraft soared into the sky. Government officials sent personnel to the warship to open the coffin and formally identify the body of the late king. Then, the coffin was opened again and brought ashore, where senior naval officers placed it in a very large colored canopy. Government officials and diplomatic representatives offered wreaths, and the people all bowed their heads in tribute. The special train transporting the coffin departed at 10:30 a.m., heading straight for the capital. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>

In addition, the L'œuvre reported news from Geneva that the League of Nations Secretariat seemed to fear convening the Council to discuss the Marseille tragedy. Some people in the Secretariat even advised the representative of a certain country not to bring the case before the Council, as it might expose the "secret maneuvers" of the Hitler Party, as the Croatians who committed the murder were suspected of having connections to Munich, Germany.

<p>(Paris) The French police are currently conducting a thorough search for a beautiful woman named Gardello Chuv, who is said to be an accomplice of Kalimen, the assassin of King Alexander of Yugoslavia and French Foreign Minister Barthou. She was seen traveling with Kalimen two days before the Marseille tragedy. It is widely believed that the handgun used by Kalimen was smuggled into Marseille by the woman. Today, a British expatriate, whose father is Bulgarian and mother is Turkish, was arrested in Chamonix. He is suspected of being an accomplice in the Marseille murders. After being interrogated by local authorities, he has been transferred to Annecy. As for Hospitch, an accomplice of assassin Kalimen, also known as Novak, and Mr. Piniés, they were detained in the special police chief's office at the Annecy station for sixty hours and were transferred to Ariège tonight, where they will be formally charged with conspiracy to murder King Alexander of Yugoslavia and French Foreign Minister Barthou, and will be temporarily detained there pending the trial in Marseille. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Marseille As a result of the efforts of the police task force, it has been determined that a terrorist group was hiding in Aix-en-Provence. The assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia was carried out by the group. The group consisted of four or five people, led by a stunningly beautiful woman, residing in a first-class hotel, while her accomplices, Kalrman Cherny K伐台尼克 and three others, stayed in small hotels with simple luggage to avoid attention. The woman was registered under the name Marie Woodlov, and her luxurious suitcases were full of weapons. The weapons used by assassin Kalrman were carried in her suitcases. This shows that the assassination was meticulously planned in advance. The girl had a companion who came to the hotel to meet her at night. His real name was 哀貢克伐台尼克, but he registered at the hotel as Kalame. That night, he went to Avignon. The next day, Kalrman went from Aix-en-Provence to Marseille. Another accomplice, Cherny, went to Avignon at night after the incident, and then from Avignon to Fontainebleau. Police found traces of him in Fontainebleau, but he has not been apprehended yet. As for the whereabouts of the mysterious woman, Marie Woodlov, they had not been determined as of 6:00 p.m. today. (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The issue of reforming the resident Manchurian organization, centered on the case of the military police commander concurrently serving as the police chief, has become a dispute between the on-site personnel and the central authorities. The Army and Colonial Ministries have each issued statements, and the conflict between the two sides is very obvious. The government instructed at the cabinet meeting on the 12th that the solution to this problem should await the handling of the situation by the current commander in Manchuria, Hishikari. Before receiving the report from the commander, they will take a wait-and-see attitude. However, even after the cabinet discussion, the Army authorities felt that the government's top officials' attitude was too moderate. On the 13th, they issued a statement, and Army Minister Hayashi also planned to meet with the Prime Minister within a day or two, with little hope that the cabinet's decision on the reform of the resident Manchurian organization would be implemented quickly. As for the Colonial Ministry, which is in opposition to the Army, even though Okada, who also serves as the Colonial Minister, issued instructions, it is difficult to remain silent on the Army's statement. Therefore, it was decided to issue a rebuttal statement on the 14th. Thus, the Army and Colonial Ministry authorities are completely in a state of conflict. Prime Minister Okada believes that this situation exposes the lack of unity within the cabinet and undermines the government's prestige, which has a significant impact on the political world. He has now decided to step in and make a ruling. All parties are paying close attention to this case. (Jiji Press Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The dispute over the reform plan for the resident Manchurian organization has shifted from the local level to a conflict between the Army and Colonial Ministries, becoming a battle of statements, exposing the lack of unity within the cabinet. The situation is quite serious. The government has no intention of modifying the reform plan that has been decided upon by the cabinet and still wants to maintain it to the end in order to implement the original plan. As for the current dispute, it has decided not to contradict the original plan and to wait for Commander Hishikari's work on the ground to find an opportunity and method for suppressing the situation. If Commander Hishikari's work does not yield results, the government will immediately assert its authority, based on the principle that the police should not be militarized, and issue a major statement. At the same time, it will clearly explain the purpose of the new organization's official system in the reform, consult the cabinet, and quickly decide to implement it. Therefore, this issue will depend on the situation on the ground. Although the Army and Colonial Ministry have been in opposition for the past few days, there will soon be a shift in the situation. (United News Agency Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Kantō Governor-General Hishikari has now sent a telegram to the Minister of Colonial Affairs, reporting on the situation on the ground regarding the reform plan. The second report was received by the Colonial Ministry on the 13th. The general content is as follows: The opinions of the officials of the Kantō Government-General are as follows: (1) Military officers must not participate in the Police Department; (2) The duties of the police and the military police should be clearly separated and not infringe upon each other; (3) The Police Chief must not be concurrently held by the military police commander.</p>
<p>If the above points are violated, the entire staff will submit their resignations and decide to leave the new organization. This trend can be inferred, and it is not yet known what kind of situation it will cause in the future. If they deliberately oppose their will or control them by force, it may be difficult to obtain complete sincerity in their work. The Governor-General is repeatedly anxious about this case and hopes that at this time, he will be able to understand the emotions of the officials of the Kantō Government-General and establish an appropriate solution. This is what I pray for. (United News Agency Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army and Colonial Ministry's opinions on the reform plan for the resident Manchurian organization are in direct conflict, exposing the disunity within the cabinet at a time of major crisis, which may cause serious consequences. Moreover, the government's hope that Commander Hishikari would work on the ground has now come to a standstill after receiving the report. Therefore, the government's wait-and-see attitude is also not allowed by the facts. However, how to suppress the opposition in the Kantō region in the future and how to implement its established policy are problems that the government authorities are painstakingly worried about.

This request was submitted to the State Department by the German Ambassador to the United States, Luther, along with an explanation stating that Germany is willing to extend the current commercial treaty, but the most-favored-nation clause must be removed. To facilitate treaty revision, Ambassador Luther formally notified that Germany intends to cancel the entire treaty when it expires on October 14 next year. Taking this opportunity, the State Department also formally notified Germany that the United States will not tolerate any discrimination against American bondholders of the Dawes Loan and expressed dissatisfaction that Germany proposed paying only 75 percent of the $2.1 million in interest due on October 15. The State Department believes that Germany's current debt situation is actually favorable to European bondholders, while Germany requests to amend the commercial treaty because it believes the treaty is excessively favorable to the United States.

It speaks of peace, but applies force everywhere." The protest also stated that Mueller and Jacob, the church management committee he appointed, are tools of the devil.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance, based on proposals from the National Financial Conference, is planning to establish a Farmers' Silkworm Cocoon Loan Office. It has ordered the banking guilds of Nanjing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Hankou, Tianjin, and Peiping to convene their members to thoroughly study and propose standards for the interest rates on loans to rural areas in silkworm cocoon regions, with the aim of lowering them to 8 percent or below. They are also instructed to promptly inform their branch banks and offices in these regions to provide loans to well-organized cooperatives in rural areas according to the standard interest rates. In addition, it has consulted with the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Sichuan, Guangdong, Shandong, and Henan provinces, instructing them to direct their subordinates to promptly organize well-organized cooperatives in rural areas, so that the banking industry can safely invest and re-lend to farmers. The Ministry of Industries has also been consulted, and it has instructed the construction departments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces, as well as the social affairs bureaus of Shanghai and Nanjing, to promptly organize and improve the existing rural silkworm cooperatives under their jurisdiction, so that the financial sector can safely provide loans.

<h3 id="e60">Britain Endeavors to Expand its Air Force (London Correspondence) <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Military Equipment is Relatively Backward Due to Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>Britain is a relatively conservative and calm nation. She is not overly trendy, especially in international politics, maintaining a gentlemanly attitude but never lagging behind. When the time is right, she acts immediately. For example, Europe has recently been arguing fiercely over military equipment. Germany withdrew from the League of Nations as a result, France is doing everything to guarantee security, Japan is using 50 percent of its national treasury for military spending, and the United States is preparing to build more than 100 warships. Britain, however, has not had any startling plans and seems unenthusiastic about military equipment. Recently, however, the situation has changed. The crisis in Europe is becoming increasingly urgent, and military needs are becoming more pressing. Britain has risen up to expand its air force and improve the mechanization of its army. According to figures released by the Aviation Ministry, the British Air Force ranks fifth in the world. First is France (with 1,600 first-line aircraft), second is the Soviet Union (with approximately 1,300 to 1,500 first-line aircraft), third is the United States, and fourth is Italy (each with approximately 1,100 aircraft). Britain has only 850 aircraft. Therefore, over the next five years (starting in 1934), it will expand by 77 flying squadrons, each squadron containing 12 single-engine aircraft or 10 to 12 twin-engine aircraft. If they are airships, each squadron will have only four, totaling 840 new aircraft.</p>
<p>Regarding the economics of the air force expansion plan, according to acting Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader Baldwin, "Since the Great War, our country has actively and continuously strived for an international military reduction policy. In order to promote this policy and set an example, we have reduced our own military equipment to the extent that it is only enough to defend against danger. This was in the hope that other countries would follow our example. However, the delay in the military reduction conference has been beyond our expectations. Over the past eight and a half years (since 1926), defects have accumulated in our national defense forces, and discussions have been frequent in all areas, loudly shouting that the border is uneasy. In particular, the increase in military expenditures in various countries has created a problem of balance of power. Therefore, we must not only make up for the shortcomings of the air force, but also re-establish the air force expansion plan that has been delayed several times. We should resolve to recognize that this cannot be delayed for a single day. The method of expansion is to expand our air force capacity to a level close to that of our nearest neighbor in recent years…"</p>
<p>The last sentence seems to refer to France as its hypothetical enemy, but the subsequent supplementary statement pays attention to Germany. Baldwin also said, "In the era of air defense, we must pay attention to the fact that the old borders have lost their effectiveness. When you think about protecting Britain, you can no longer consider the defenses between the cliffs of Dover. You must pay attention to the fact that today's borders must extend to the banks of the Rhine."</p>
<p>When the air force expansion plan was proposed, Labor Party House of Lords member Ponsonby immediately advocated opposition, believing that "the military reduction conference has just ended, and French Foreign Minister Barthou has just visited London. If an arms expansion proposal is put forward, this policy will not only fail to guarantee security but will also be harmful to world peace and even cause an arms race, so it is regrettable...." He also believed that military balance with France was meaningless, and moreover, after the so-called Anglo-French understanding, would it not arouse national suspicion? However, in the end, Ponsonby's proposal was rejected by a majority of 54 to 9, meaning that the air force expansion plan passed in the House of Lords and would be transferred to the House of Commons.</p>
<p>In the House of Commons, the main criticism came from the Liberal Party's Samuel, who focused solely on financial issues. He said, "The air force expansion plan proposed by the Minister of Aviation costs one penny for every pound earned. This is not the first penny, nor is it the last penny. Our total military expenditure is £113 million, which is about 2 shillings and 6 pence for every pound earned. If we add past war expenses, then the annual military expenditure is £35.7 million. This number is larger than the total revenue from income tax and inheritance tax… Therefore, if this causes an arms expansion competition, Parliament really does not have the courage to approve this proposal." The government's explanation still focused on the small size of the air force and national defense security. The result was that the Labor Party's proposal was rejected, and the air force expansion plan was established. On the eve of the naval conference, Britain's actions have a tendency to prepare for war.</p>

<p>— Ming Dao</p>
<p>Strict Investigation Aboard Ship</p>
<p>Poor Economic Conditions in Nagasaki</p>
<p>The neighboring country of Japan is very close. A dozen years ago, even the slowest ship could travel from Shanghai to Nagasaki in just under a day. Now, it only takes 29 hours.</p>
<p>On the ship, everything seems to be going smoothly. People who have lived in Shanghai for a long time especially enjoy the taste of the sea breeze. However, on the other hand, we feel both amused and suffocated by things like the Japanese maritime police investigation. In the past, only doctors came to check for epidemics, with no other procedures. Now, the epidemic check seems less important, but they pay attention to each person's identity, origin, and destination. Their attitude is indeed very polite, but their attention to detail is extremely meticulous, truly showing devotion to duty. Let's put aside personal feelings and make a calm analysis. The first point is that their national organization is strict, with control over everyone entering and leaving the country (whether foreign or domestic). This is also due to Japan's geographical position, surrounded by the sea, allowing for effective monitoring of entry and exit. The second point is that they fully exercise their political power in all areas under their jurisdiction, never letting anything slide or being lazy. Perhaps this is a manifestation of their extraordinary period, making it clear that this is not peacetime but has special significance.</p>
<p>For example, a person who is fierce on the outside but timid on the inside is not to be feared. You can tell at a glance that they have no far-reaching ambitions. However, a person who is extremely humble in speech, very respectful in attitude, and whose purpose is very grand, employing various methods with great determination, is worth paying attention to. The maritime police on the ship belong to this category. They are always outwardly respectful to foreigners, seeking to understand your connections from all angles. They only feel at ease when they are certain that you harbor goodwill towards Japan. They are uneasy about those who have no particular likes or dislikes for Japan. If you inadvertently reveal something, they become vigilant and defensive. A friend on board said that Japanese police always assume the worst of people and try to imagine things in the worst possible light. Therefore, they always treat foreign visitors with suspicion.</p>
<p>Customs inspection is carried out on the pier for ordinary third-class passengers. First- and second-class passengers are inspected on the ship. It is said that inspecting on the ship is a courtesy to passengers, done for their convenience. However, when they have extra time, they can sit down and carefully examine each item. For example, paper cigarettes, radios, explosives, handguns, and cameras are subject to heavy taxes or prohibition. Even personal daily necessities are carefully inspected, fearing any hidden items. They are even more lenient with books, examining them one by one, and anything that catches their attention is recorded in a register for future review. They pay even more attention to Western books. In short, they do not avoid any trouble that can be caused.</p>
<p>Nagasaki is the closest port to China. In the past, many Chinese people did business here, and commerce was quite developed. Now, it has declined. Except for a very few Western-style clothing stores and restaurants, Chinese merchants have almost no place to stand. Even if there is no political interference, it is unlikely they could survive in the current economic downturn. There were only two or three Chinese merchants on board, and a dozen or so students. This shows the natural situation when Sino-Japanese relations cannot proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Nagasaki is just after its annual "Great Festival." The depressed economic conditions seem to have been somewhat alleviated, but this is just a drop in the ocean, unable to quench a long drought. The slogans "Great Discount" and "Great Sale" are still posted everywhere, replacing the old with the new. Store signs hang all over the streets, but customers are few and far between, and business is slow. Nagasaki is a mid-sized city with a population of just over 220,000. Import and export trade is also quite active, and the harbor is filled with an American merchant ship and a visiting French warship, but there are few foreign merchants and tourists. Although the authorities are trying hard to use strong stimulants to excite the general public, the inherent vitality is insufficient, and the stimulation is only temporarily effective. There are indeed few people begging on the streets, but I personally saw two or three people with insufficient clothing picking up discarded scraps of paper along the main street. As for people who are not getting enough nutrition, there are many more. These are just a few brief observations of what I saw on the surface, reported to my fellow countrymen.

<h3 id="e62">Guangzhou Agricultural Exhibition <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Exhibits Displayed in Ten Rooms</p>
<p>Opened on the 7th and Exhibited for Seven Days</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The city's agricultural exhibition opened on October 7 at the Pingmin Palace on Danan Road. A majestic archway was built in front of the venue, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen hanging above, flanked by the flag of the Party and the Nation. Below was the exhibition slogan, "Urbanizing the Countryside, Ruralizing the City." To the left of the entrance was the Disciplinary Department, and to the right were the Fire and Rescue Departments. A silk-reeling machine was displayed in the main hall. The various exhibition rooms were to the right, and potted flowers and trees were displayed on the left. The opening ceremony was held at noon on that day, presided over by Mayor Liu Jiwen, who announced the reasons for holding the exhibition. Guests then gave speeches in turn, and the ceremony concluded at around 2 PM, followed by the public exhibition. The venue was divided into ten rooms, displaying exhibits from various departments, mostly focusing on sericulture and rice cultivation, as these are the main agricultural products of Guangdong Province. The first room was for sericulture, with the words "Reviving Guangdong Silk" written in the center of a rotating globe made by the Shunde Sericulture Implementation Zone at the entrance. There were over 200 exhibits inside. The second room had charts and evidence of silk improvement methods. The third room displayed improved silk products. The above three rooms were all for sericulture, and there were also paper products made from mulberry branches and a model of the rise and fall of the sericulture industry in Shunde County. When the silk industry in the province was at its peak, the annual value of silk exports exceeded 100 million yuan, but in recent years, it has decreased to 20 to 30 million yuan, leading to the economic bankruptcy of silkworm farmers and shaking the entire social economy. The fourth room was for aquatic products, with diagrams of fish pond oyster farming and models of trawler ships, as well as specimens of aquatic products such as fish and shrimp, totaling over 200 items, all produced by the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau. The fifth room was for agricultural economics and meteorology, with diagrams of new rural economic construction. The structure utilizes the organization of cooperatives, operates cultivation, and equips it scientifically, so that agricultural harvests achieve excellent results. In addition, there were hundreds of agricultural charts, mostly produced by the Agricultural College of Sun Yat-sen University, Lingnan University Agricultural College, and Zhongkai School. The sixth room was for forests, soils, and fertilizers, with soil specimens, fertilizer specimens, forest seeds, and timber charts from various counties and cities in the province, totaling hundreds of items. The seventh room was for agronomy, horticulture, pests, and diseases, with improved methods for grafting and promoting the growth of sugarcane and fruit trees, as well as over 1,000 insect specimens. The research and methods of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau in preventing and controlling agricultural pests were quite systematic, and the products of Zhongda, Nanda, and Zhongkai schools were also excellent. The improved sugarcane varieties in the room grew to over 10 feet tall and several inches in diameter in just eight months, three times larger than local sugarcane. The newly invented pest control drugs were also effective. The eighth room was for new agricultural implements, such as threshing machines, cultivators, weeders, powder sprayers, mist sprayers, single-shaft plows, A-frame plows, spike-tooth harrows, and water pumps, all of which were recently improved and more economical and durable than imported products. The tenth room was for animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, with one purebred Siberian boar and one sow, each weighing over 300 pounds, as well as over 100 Beijing ducks and Lixing chickens. The improved chickens can lay 250 to 300 eggs per year, and there are also charts detailing the steps and methods for improving pigs, chickens, and ducks. The exhibition is open to the public for seven consecutive days starting from the 7th, with entertainment and dramas to add to the fun, so the situation is very lively. (9th)</p>

<h3 id="e63">Recent News on the Economic Situation of the Nanyang Islands <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Progress in Foreign Trade of Malaya</p>
<p>Due to Rising Prices of Rubber and Tin</p>
<p>Singapore Correspondence: The group of islands located between the Indian and Pacific Oceans are collectively known by our countrymen as the Nanyang Islands. These islands, situated in the tropics, are rich in resources and sparsely populated, hence have long been known as a paradise on earth. Diligent and hardworking overseas Chinese have ventured deep into this uniquely endowed land, rightly viewing it as a place where gold is everywhere, easily attainable. However, the world situation shifts and changes constantly. Since the winds of global economic downturn reached Asia, the first to be affected was this very paradise where gold was said to be everywhere. Native products plummeted in price, factories closed down, resulting in hundreds of thousands of workers being plunged into the gloom of unemployment. A portion of these unemployed workers were our diligent and hardworking overseas Chinese. Unable to make a living in the Southern Islands after losing their jobs, they could only return to their homeland en masse. At the same time, those compatriots who remained in Nanyang, due to the poor market situation and sluggish business, had no surplus funds to remit back to their motherland, causing the social and economic situation in our Fujian and Guangdong provinces, which rely heavily on remittances from overseas Chinese for a large part of their income, to deteriorate daily, almost beyond repair. Therefore, the economic situation of the Nanyang Islands has a close and vital relationship with our country, which we cannot afford to ignore. What exactly is the current economic situation of the Nanyang Islands? This is what our compatriots in the motherland would like to know. According to investigations, the current economic situation of the Nanyang Islands has indeed made significant progress compared to before. The biggest reason for this is the high prices of rubber and tin. As for the regions, British territories have seen more progress than Dutch territories. The reasons for this difference are twofold: first, rubber and tin are the main products of Malaya, while the Dutch territories only consider them secondary; second, the Dutch monetary system still uses the gold standard, so their prices are relatively higher, making it difficult to sell (Note: Currently, one Straits dollar is only worth a little over 84 Dutch cents). This is the slight difference in the current economic situation between the British and Dutch territories.</p>
<p>As for the figures of Malaya's foreign trade, according to the latest report from the local Registrar of Statistics, the total value of import trade last year was 362,474,000 yuan, and the export trade was 415,584,000 yuan. Offsetting the imports and exports, there was a surplus of 53,110,000 yuan. In the previous year, Malaya's foreign trade had a deficit of 16,430,000 yuan. Therefore, since last year, Malaya has clearly begun to recover and prosper. According to the recent report from the Singapore Chamber of Commerce, from January to July of this year, Malaya's foreign trade showed an increase of 93,000,000 yuan in export trade and 57,000,000 yuan in import trade compared to last year. Therefore, it is predicted that by the end of this year, Malaya's foreign trade will also show progress compared to last year.</p>
<h3 id="e64">The Communist Bandits of Changting Have No Natural Defenses <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Because Shicheng and Changting were surrounded and attacked from the northeast and northwest, Zhu and Mao have moved their foremost front line to the boundary ridge between Ruijin and Changting. Taking advantage of the rugged terrain, they have built many fortresses. The boundary ridge leads to the Wuyi Mountains on the left and Junmen Ridge on the right. The bandits, relying on their ability to scale mountains and travel at night, are defending themselves with the terrain against the National Army. On September 26th and 27th, the battles on the Pengkou and Wenfang lines were all initiated by the bandits' night attacks. As a result, the National Army achieved a great victory. Important passes such as Zhongwu Village, Yiyang Ridge, and Banxian Rock were all recovered by the National Army. This place is only sixty to seventy *li* away from Changting City. The terrain of Tingzhou is surrounded by mountains on all sides. The most unique thing is that a high mountain rises within the city, and the walls on all sides rely on the mountains and water, making it exceptionally majestic. This mountain is called Dragon Mountain. The water of the Yin River flows southward through Shanghang and Dabu, converging into the Han River. Therefore, Tingzhou paper has always used Chaozhou as the main distribution area, and then transported for export from Shantou. The Yin River runs for dozens of *li* in the Ting area, and the quicksand is like gold, dazzling and eye-catching, also known as Golden Sand. Zhongwu Village can be called a natural barrier on the front line from Changting to Liancheng. Now that this place has been recovered by the National Army, the bandits have no natural defenses within seventy *li* of the city. It is only a matter of time before the National Army captures Changting.</p>
<h3 id="e65">The Issue of Taking Over the Eastern Tombs <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>丨 Representatives of the Committee Have Been Selected 丨</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The issue of taking over the Eastern Tombs in Malanyu has been discussed for a long time. The reason why it could not be realized earlier was initially due to the issue of the withdrawal of the puppet troops stationed at the Eastern Tombs, which took time for repeated consultations. Then it was because the representatives of the Qing imperial family and clans in the Eastern Tombs Management Committee could not be appointed, and because the car road between Beiping and Malanyu was washed out by rain and cars could not travel, making the date of takeover impossible to determine. However, the administrative part of Malanyu was taken over by our side two months ago, and Yin Tixin was sent as the resident director of the Jiji District Office in Yu. What is now being said about the takeover is the transfer of the responsibility for the Eastern Tombs management, and the entry of our security team into Malanyu and the Eastern Tombs to maintain law and order.</p>
<p>In the past, the Eastern Tombs had a management committee. After the Great Wall War, puppet troops entered, and the committee could not exercise its functions. Yin Rugeng, the special commissioner of the Jiji District Office, negotiated with the Japanese side earlier, and as a result, the puppet troops stationed at the tombs decided to withdraw completely outside the pass when we took over. Our side is fully responsible for the management of the tombs. At the same time, the organization of the Tombs Protection Committee will be slightly expanded, with the addition of two representatives from the Qing imperial family and clans. After the agreement was reached by both parties, the elderly among the Qing imperial family and clans did not want to be bothered, and the younger ones did not command sufficient public respect. This is one of the real reasons why the representatives could not be appointed immediately. After Yin Rugeng repeatedly urged the Qing imperial family and clans, Pu Xian and Bo Nian have been appointed, and yesterday they notified the Jiji District Office in writing. In addition to the special commissioner of the Jiji District, the county magistrate of Xinglong, and the resident director of the Jiji District Office in Malanyu as ex officio members, the committee members are also one representative each from the Hebei Industry Department and the Civil Affairs Department, and the two representatives recommended by the Qing imperial family, to jointly organize the committee. Now that the Qing imperial representatives have been recommended, only the Civil Affairs Department is still selecting a representative, who can be appointed in the next few days. Although the date of establishment of the committee has not been determined, there is no objection to it officially starting work before the actual takeover of the Eastern Tombs.</p>
<p>Regarding all the preparations for the takeover of the Eastern Tombs, our side began to proceed two months ago. Yin Tixin, the resident director of the Jiji District Office in Malanyu, started the process as soon as he took office, and the date of takeover was also predetermined. Later, due to continuous rains in the north, the Pingyu road was flooded above the knees, and traffic was completely cut off, causing the takeover procedures to be stranded. The general public rumored that the takeover was indefinite, and those concerned believed that this was a fabrication by those who did not understand the truth and was not worth refuting.</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng, the special commissioner of the Jiji District, recently agreed with Shibayama Kenjiro, the military attache of the Japanese embassy, to inspect the Eastern Tombs in Malanyu together tomorrow (the 14th) and to agree on the date of takeover. Shibayama had originally planned a trip to Tangshan, so it was decided that after going to Malanyu with Yin, he would then travel to Tangshan. Yin had already prepared the vehicles for the trip on the day before yesterday (the 11th). Yin Tixin, the director of Malanyu, returned to Beiping because of the Miyagoe case, and also rushed to Malanyu on the day before yesterday (the 11th) to prepare everything. However, Yin Rugeng suddenly caught a cold last night (the 12th), and this morning (the 13th) temporarily sent his secretary He Xiaoyi to meet with Shibayama, informing him that he would postpone the trip due to illness. Shibayama also agreed. As for the funds for the Eastern Tombs Protection Committee, there were funds in the past, supplemented by the land tax of the tomb area. The income and expenses can be offset. The location of the committee is in the Eastern Tombs, and Yin Tixin, Li Ying (county magistrate of Xinglong), and Bo Nian were designated among the committee members to stay at the tombs regularly to preside over daily affairs (13th).</p>

<p>Improving Land Tax Collection by Implementing Clear Measurement</p>
<p>Paying Attention to Public Health by Establishing Hospitals</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Assistance from Teachers and Students of Shanghai McKinnon School</p>
<p>Politics in our country takes the county as the unit, so reforming county administration is the key to rebuilding the countryside, and the foundation for the revival of the nation. Burying oneself in this practical work has gradually become a trend in various places in recent years. Ding County in Hebei is the most notable example. He County in Anhui is now also said to be remarkable. The construction of He County has only been in recent years, and there are several aspects of its development in the past few months that are worth mentioning. I will record a brief outline to serve as a reference for those engaged in social work.</p>
<p>The most important thing for county administration and rural areas is the land tax. The failure to equalize land taxes in various counties, as well as the corruption in the collection of grain by township chiefs and guarantors, has always been the biggest problem in our country. He County originally had more than a thousand people involved in land tax collection. They had no salary, so they habitually extorted money from the people illegally. Now, a grain counter has been set up in the county government, and farmers generally go directly to the county government to pay their grain. The county government grain counter now only uses about thirty people, and they have fixed salaries. Farmers used to bring an extra ten cents when paying grain, but now it has been reduced to seven cents, which is used to pay the salaries of the grain counter staff. However, this is only a passive measure to eliminate the abuses of land tax. If we want to actively rectify the land tax to equalize the burden, we must engage in clear measurement. The work of clear measurement of fields in He County was voluntarily undertaken by teachers and students of Shanghai McKinnon Middle School and St. John's University during the summer vacation. A group of six people, including Zheng Binzhi, Wu Xiangguang, and Ling Dingzhong from McKinnon Middle School, and Duan Rumei and Zhang Junliang from St. John's University, led by McKinnon Middle School teacher Lai Puwu, went to He County from Shanghai on July 2nd this summer, and returned after three weeks. They measured the third district in the north of He County and completed six maps, which have now been adopted by the county.</p>
<p>Secondly, medical and health care are most directly related to the suffering of the people. The people of He County are not very enlightened, and most of the doctors are people without deep research in medical and health science. The land is barren and the people are poor, so they have no extra strength to equip a new-style hospital. Dr. Fu of Shanghai Renji Hospital was invited to the county before National Day to plan everything, and County Magistrate Liu convened local people to discuss ways to help fund it. It was agreed that each gentry would donate 20 yuan per month, raising 300 yuan per month, to fund the project. Dr. Fu has now returned to Shanghai and is responsible for purchasing materials and medicines, and persuading Chinese doctors among his colleagues to go there to practice medicine. The letter from County Magistrate Liu of He County to President Shen of Shanghai McKinnon Middle School is also recorded below:</p>
<p>"More than two months have passed since your school's surveying team left He and returned to Shanghai. Time flies, as if it were yesterday. This move by your school will bring infinite hope to the future of politics and the welfare of the people in our county. The biggest problem with land tax in our country is the failure to equalize the burden. The rich rely on their power to conceal their grain, while the poor have to pay double. The reason for this is that there are no accurate maps to serve as the basis for measurement and investigation. The team has achieved so much in our county in the shortest period of time. They worked tirelessly under the scorching heat, and their spirit and perseverance have amazed everyone who saw them. The deep gratitude of the people of our county cannot be described in words. I sincerely express my extreme gratitude to the teachers and students of the surveying team of your school. The fact that the maps measured by the team are now being fully utilized is what I want to report to you. A few days ago, we received a letter from the leader of the team dated the 18th of this month, saying, "The entire team is currently eagerly discussing further work plans, and plans to organize three teams during the two-week winter vacation and next year's summer vacation, one for surveying, one for medicine, and one for construction, to return to He County to work. The first team will of course continue the work of this summer. As for the work plan of the second team, it has now been approved by the Renji Hospital on Shandong Road, and will receive considerable training before departure in preparation for service. The work of the third team will be to repair the streets of villages and towns, the hot spring bath in Xiangquan Town, and build ditches on various roads to facilitate transportation. The biggest job is to dredge the old river channels to allow the waters of the Yangtze River to penetrate deep into the hinterland to prevent the recurrence of drought. In a previous letter, it was said, "I would like to reiterate the proposal to return to He County for service. Although your place insists on supplying food and travel expenses, we are willing to provide our own funds. The principal and all colleagues of our school are willing to support us. The students who went to He County have been highly praised and valued by other students after returning to school, which is also worth comforting. "Another letter said, "The students still feel excited when talking about the work they did in He County last time, and He County will be strongly promoted in our school this semester. If your Excellency needs enthusiastic service in the future, there will definitely be many people. Your Excellency said that you need doctors and public health work. I have told Dr. Fu of the Renji Hospital on Shandong Road about this matter. He plans to take advantage of the summer vacation to visit your place for a week to conduct an inspection, which may be of some benefit. He may be able to find a way to persuade some Chinese doctors among his colleagues who are willing to practice medicine in your place. "The above-mentioned points in each letter make it impossible for me not to be fascinated and express my most sincere gratitude. Please convey our heartfelt welcome to the colleagues and students of your school on my behalf. If you come to our county during this year's winter vacation and next year's summer vacation to help farmers with their work and investigate the rural situation, I will do my best to provide all kinds of conveniences. As for the members of the service team, the more the better. It is true that the society in our county needs improvement and help in the most places, and it is also the most urgent."</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>The Mule and Horse Fair in Ledu County</p>
<p>There was originally a road from Xining to Wuwei (Liangzhou) or Zhangye (Ganzhou), but the mountain slopes were high and the area was remote. It was necessary to carry food and tents and travel in groups. As a reporter traveling alone, I felt very inconvenient. Therefore, on July 5th, I still took the original road back to Lanzhou. The mountain ranges along the way stretched from west to east, with high and low layers overlapping for hundreds of *li*. Generally speaking, the mountain ranges in the front were lower in height because they ran parallel to the plains and rivers, and the color of the grass was tender yellow. The mountains in the back were higher than the previous layer, and the color of the mountains also changed from light green to dark black. The peaks were covered with white snow, and the silver light was dazzling. There were even higher peaks, a line of blue, the same color as the sky, which could be faintly seen in the depressions of the mountain peaks in the front range, but they were already hundreds of *li* away.</p>
<p>Two days later, I passed through Ledu. It was the county's mule and horse fair in East Lake Park. The sound of gongs and drums filled the air, and the voices of people were boiling. It could be heard from several *li* away. A stage was erected in the middle of the square, with a paper plaque with gold characters on a red background hanging on it, saying, "Welcome Regiment Commander Ma Zhiwu." The play was "Jing Zhong," performed in Qinqiang opera. In front of the stage, the officers and soldiers of Regiment Commander Ma's regiment sat on the ground holding guns, and the ordinary audience surrounded them. Women watched from further away, and Mongol and Tibetan men and women mingled in various places, their clothes colorful, and their ornaments jangling, creating an image of various ethnic groups gathering together to celebrate peace and prosperity. According to the talk, the fair had been suspended for many years and was suddenly restored this year. The audience from various villages was still enthusiastic, but the mule and horse trade was very sluggish. The officials and gentry were meeting and planned to continue the opera for ten days. The source of funds was (1) stall donations, (2) commission from gambling, and (3) a discretionary levy on sales. It was predicted that the income and expenses would be offset, and there might even be a surplus, etc.</p>
<p>Later, I arrived at Xincheng and escaped the heat by the Yellow River. I saw a water mill, which was simple in construction and had a good idea (of course, it could not be compared to a flour machinery company). The method was to use a wide boat, with holes on both sides, and a wooden beam running horizontally outside the edge. At both ends of the wood, boards were inserted as wheels, shaped like windmills, half submerged in the river. The water flowed and the wheels turned, and the wood rotated continuously. Then, a gear was placed in the middle of the wood to interlock with the edge wheel of the "mill" placed in the boat, horizontally and vertically. The wooden wheel rotated, and the mill also rotated non-stop. The boat was covered with a house, and a rope was tied to the shore. When the water rose, the boat (that is, the mill) rose; when the water fell, the boat lowered. The water flow was not fixed, and the boat could be moved, and the rotation of the mill wheel could not be restricted. This was not seen when I came, so I added it above.</p>
<h3 id="e68">A Brief Talk by Chairman Zhu <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>When I arrived in Lanzhou, it happened that Chairman Zhu Shaoliang had also returned from the capital, so I went to visit him. The main points of the conversation are roughly as follows: "Fortunately, the security situation in Gansu Province has gradually improved. The facts of the past one or two years can be seen in general. However, the established practice of garrison troops extracting funds locally still needs to be eliminated. When it comes to politics, it is easier to be effective. Gansu Province's finances have been insufficient for many years. This time I went to the capital to contact Minister Kong of Finance to negotiate assistance, and I have been allowed to find a way. If this can be realized early, the administration of Gansu will be easier to promote," etc. Zhu's words were concise and to the point. I admire his insight very much. If the established practice of garrison troops extracting funds locally is not eliminated, not only will the financial revenue figures be nominal, but it will be difficult to make a reliable overall plan for political construction, and it will even invisibly add to the burden on the people, who have already been exhausted. How can the poor people bear it? Now that Zhu has seen the evils of the times and is seeking ways to remedy them, the gospel of the people of Gansu can be said to be right before our eyes.</p>
<p>The finances of Gansu Province are indeed difficult. Since the reorganization of the provincial government last year, although no effort has been spared in reorganizing taxation, it is difficult to reform because of deep-rooted habits. The provincial government's plan for reorganizing taxation has not been followed and implemented in most counties, so that the index of income and expenditure for this year is only 5,538,728 yuan versus 6,985,791 yuan, which is still short of 1,447,063 yuan. In Gansu Province, where the land is vast and the resources are abundant, but the burden on farmers is heavy and the provincial treasury is exhausted, then it is necessary to realize the reorganization of taxation. This is a responsibility that the authorities cannot shirk. From another point of view, the huge military expenditure in this province and the meager construction expenses are also a major reason for the decline of the rural economy and the depression of production. The following is an excerpt of the financial revenue and expenditure statements of the first, second, and third months of this year, recently released by the Finance Department, to get a glimpse of the financial difficulties of Gansu Province.</p>
<p>January: "Old accounts" are short by 1,099,574.359 yuan, "New revenue" from land tax, commodity tax, regular and miscellaneous taxes, etc., totals 184,584.773 yuan, "Expenditures" on party affairs, internal affairs, finance, education, military affairs, judiciary, construction, transportation, and various expenses, totals 358,705.385 yuan, "Comparison" of expenditures exceeds by 174,120.612 yuan.</p>
<p>February: "Old accounts" are short by 1,273,694.971 yuan, "New revenue" totals 119,423.024 yuan, "Expenditures" total 201,186.835 yuan, "Comparison" of expenditures exceeds by 81,763.811 yuan.</p>
<p>March: "Old accounts" are short by 1,355,458.782 yuan, "New revenue" totals 290,087.264 yuan, "Expenditures" total 278,877.006 yuan, "Comparison" of new revenue exceeds by 11,210.258 yuan. In addition, there is also new revenue and old savings from the social obligations donation. After deducting expenses such as Zhongshan Hospital, Gansu National Medical Branch, Provincial Relief Institute, Relief Committee, relief funds for various counties, and former porridge factory, the actual savings are 181,483.198 yuan (Note to this table: Under the actual savings item, the previous finance department misappropriated and underpaid the principal amount of 140,911.802 yuan).</p>
<p>According to the above numbers, the total surplus from comparing the revenue and expenditure of the three months is 244,674.165 yuan. With such a large surplus in three months, and considering the past years of deficit, the surplus at the end of the year should reach several hundred thousand yuan. Among them, military expenditure accounts for the largest share of expenditure, and the index of construction, education, and other expenses is very weak. This is why the authorities recently reduced military expenditure and requested assistance from the central government. When the central government strictly ordered local governments to abolish exorbitant taxes and prohibit additional land taxes, the province's past revenue index, on the contrary, showed miscellaneous taxes occupying the highest position. Under such special circumstances, it is truly not easy to reorganize taxation.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Suzhou's Plan to Dredge the Wusong River <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Dredging the Wusong River has been included in the outline of the water conservancy construction plan by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. It has been decided to subsidize 500,000 yuan for construction this winter, and the Taihu Basin Water Conservancy Committee has been entrusted to measure and prescribe the construction plan. The Wusong River surveying team organized by the committee has already set off a month ago, first going to the downstream to carry out surveying. On the 5th of this month, Sun Fushi, the secretary-general of the committee, accompanied by Liu Zhongwei, the head of the surveying and mapping section, took a steamboat from Guajingkou in Wujiang down the river to Shanghai, for a detailed inspection. When reporters visited them the other day, they said that reeds were growing in Guajingkou outside the upper reaches of the Wusong River, almost turning it into land, and a deep waterway should be opened up to facilitate water discharge. The section from Guajingkou to Jianghe Village is about 10 kilometers long and is slightly silted up. However, there are many lakes and branching rivers nearby, and there are very few boats traveling back and forth, so dredging has no major relationship with transportation and water discharge. If funds are sufficient, dredging it will be more convenient for shipping. The section from Jianghe Village to Qingyang Port is about 44 kilometers long. The river is wide and the water is deep, and the situation is very good. From Qingyang Port, more and more boats travel back and forth. The section from Qingyang Port to Xugong Port is about 24 kilometers long. The river is about 60 meters wide, and the riverbed is still deep, so there is no need for dredging. The section from Xugong Port to Xiaoshadu is about 38 kilometers long. The tide does not reach it, and it is so silted up that it is unbearable. Water transport is at its busiest, and dredging is urgently needed. This section of the river is narrow, less than 50 meters wide, and the bends are particularly severe. According to the villagers nearby, there are as many as seventy-two large and small bends. The worst ones are Fengjiabang, Yujidun, and Fanwangdu. Therefore, it is still necessary to widen and straighten this section. Two-thirds of this section is in Jiangsu Province, and one-third is in Shanghai. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has already designated the funds and will start construction soon. However, there is no news from the Shanghai Municipal Government, so the committee has submitted a request to the Ministry of the Interior to forward it to the Shanghai Municipal Government, asking them to raise funds as soon as possible so that construction can start simultaneously upstream and downstream.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Villagers Open Gambling Den and Gather to Resist Arrest <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>In the Xusheli area near Zhangshe in the fourth district, Tanhuang opera performances have been held recently, and gambling dens have been opened, attracting crowds to gamble. After receiving a secret report, the Public Security Bureau sent inspectors and patrol team members to the countryside to arrest them at about 8:00 p.m. the night before last. At that time, the gamblers were calling out numbers and enjoying themselves when they saw the police team coming to the countryside. A gambler named Yuan Achang took the lead in shouting to resist arrest, and Wu Ada and others used long benches and other objects to attack the police officers. For a time, the noise was deafening and the order was in chaos. Seeing the situation was bad, the police team fired warning shots and arrested eleven gamblers including Yuan Achang, Wu Ada, and Zhou Peixing on the spot. Unexpectedly, after walking only a few steps, the gamblers united hundreds of villagers and chased after them, hoping to snatch them away. After the police team fired warning shots again, the pursuers retreated. After walking about two *li*, the gamblers came again, and the police officers had to fire warning shots three times before they fled in all directions. That night, the arrested gamblers were taken to the bureau and transferred to the court yesterday for interrogation.</p>

<p>This year's drought and famine have affected more than 300,000 *mu* of fields in this county. Previously, the county government committee members went to various districts to survey the famine and requested the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction Departments to send committee members to Wuxi for a repeat survey. It is now known that the Finance Department has ordered Ye Tiesheng, the accounting director of Wujin County, and the Construction Department has ordered Tang Xixiang, the director of the silkworm test station, to be famine survey committee members in this county. They arrived in Wuxi the day before yesterday. After meeting with County Magistrate Yan, they went with the original survey committee members of this county, Zang Hu and Zhu Fang, to inspect the fourth and sixth districts. They are scheduled to go to the ninth district for inspection again today.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Large Shipment of Opium Transported to Wuxi for Sale <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The three local opium dens, Yongxing, Futai, and Dachang, officially opened yesterday (the 14th). Earlier, each business sent representatives to the town of Zhenjiang to negotiate with the Yongfeng and Tongchang opium warehouses. They purchased five large crates of Sichuan and Yunnan opium, totaling 5,000 taels. At around 9 PM the previous evening, they hired a car to travel directly from the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway to Jurong. From Jurong, they transferred to Lishui, Liyang, and Yixing before reaching Wuxi. Along the way, they were protected by soldiers from the Provincial Security Department. Upon arrival at the Yuantong Road intersection inside Guangfu Gate, the goods were unloaded and transported by rickshaw to each business for sale. However, the total number of opium smokers in this county is approximately 15,000, with 9,577 registered. The amount of opium transported to Wuxi this time is insufficient to meet the demand. Therefore, there are plans to continue purchasing goods from Zhenjiang within the next few days. The county's anti-opium association has completed the registration of opium smokers, and all smoker licenses have been filled out. Therefore, the following regulations for issuing licenses to opium smokers have been specially formulated: 1. Opium smokers must begin collecting their licenses from their original registration location starting October 16th, until October 31st. 2. When collecting their licenses, opium smokers must present their original receipt and submit three 2.5-inch headshot photographs. Licenses will not be issued without photographs. 3. Opium smokers must follow the procedures to collect their licenses. All registration locations are strictly prohibited from collecting service fees. Violators will be investigated and severely punished.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Ministry of Finance Increases Silver Export Tax to Prevent Silver Export <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Currently, the silver export tax rate has been specially formulated.</p>
<p>An order was issued to the Customs Administration to instruct its subordinates to comply.</p>
<p>The order will be uniformly implemented starting the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, based on a request from the Shanghai Silver and Money Exchange Association and others to find ways to prevent the export of silver, has specially formulated a silver export tax rate. It will be uniformly implemented starting the 15th of this month. Yesterday, an order was issued to the Customs Administration to instruct the Inspector General of Customs and the Superintendents and Commissioners of Customs to comply. A New News Agency reporter found and recorded the original submission and order as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e80">Submission from the Silver and Money Exchange Association, etc. <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>A submission from the Shanghai Silver and Money Exchange Association and others to the Ministry of Finance states: Regarding the matter of requesting measures to prevent silver exports, since the price of silver overseas has risen sharply, domestic silver in China has been concentrated in Shanghai and then exported abroad. The amount of exports is increasing daily, leading to financial desolation and economic depression in the interior. The amount of silver in Shanghai has been gradually increasing due to exports, and as the price of silver rises, domestic prices are falling, making it impossible for factories to maintain operations, and workers are roaming the streets. If this continues, we fear that resources will be depleted, affecting finance, the national economy, and the people's livelihood, all of which will suffer. Your Excellency presides over the nation's financial policies and is aware of these dangerous signs. Therefore, we earnestly appeal that you quickly take measures to prevent this, to protect resources and maintain the national foundation. We await your orders with the utmost respect. Respectfully submitted to Minister of Finance Kong, Lin Kanghou of the National Federation of Commerce, Qin Runqing, representative of the Money Exchange Association, Chen Zeqing, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Ye Fuxiao and Chen Guangfu, representatives of the Banking Association.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Order from the Ministry of Finance to the Customs Administration <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>An order from the Ministry of Finance to the Customs Administration states: Director Shen of the Customs Administration, Shanghai Banking Association, Money Exchange Association, and Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce have submitted that recently, overseas silver prices have risen sharply, domestic silver reserves are increasingly being exported, and there are concerns that resources will be depleted, affecting finance, the national economy, and the people's livelihood. They earnestly request prompt measures to prevent this. China uses silver as its standard, and the currency material should be carefully preserved. If the price of silver rises sharply and differs greatly from general prices, it will inevitably affect finance and harm society. The balance of international exchange rates should also be maintained. The association's request to take measures to prevent this and protect resources is essential. Therefore, the silver export tax rate is specially formulated as follows: (1) Silver standard coins will be subject to an export tax of 10%, minus a minting fee of 2.25%, resulting in a net tax of 7.75%. (2) Large silver ingots and other types of silver will be subject to an additional export tax of 7.75%, combined with the original 2.25%, for a total of 10%. If the exchange rate of the London silver price converted to Shanghai exchange is different from the exchange rate approved by the Central Bank that day, a balancing tax should be added according to the difference after paying the above export tax. This will be uniformly implemented starting the 15th of this month. You are hereby ordered to instruct the Inspector General of Customs and the Superintendents and Commissioners of Customs to comply and implement this order.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Central Bank Announcement <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Central Bank announces that, starting October 15th of this year, in accordance with the government's instructions on silver export taxation, the bank will calculate the difference between the London silver price and the Shanghai telegraphic transfer to London, and notify customs after approving it at 11:30 AM every business day for easy conversion. This is hereby announced.</p>

<p>The American Reply to Our Country Has Been Forwarded to the Capital</p>
<p>Balanced Imports and Exports Can Prevent Silver Outflow</p>
<p>According to a New News Agency report, the Ministry of Finance is exchanging views with the U.S. government on the issue of China's large silver exports. Yesterday, according to sources, the U.S. reply to China has been forwarded from Washington to the capital. However, the content of the reply will not be announced until the Chinese and American authorities agree on a date. Regarding remedial measures for silver exports, according to the opinion of a certain economic expert, to prevent the export of silver, the people of the country should implement the use of domestic goods in principle. Since China is an importing country, as long as the people of the country have a unified determination not to use foreign goods and to balance imports and exports, silver will not flow out, and the price of silver will stabilize accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Chamber of Commerce Cables the Central Political Council to Correct the Stamp Tax Law <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Tax Rate is Increased Up to Fifty Times Compared to the Current Rate</p>
<p>Commercial Strength Cannot Bear the Burden; It Should Be Corrected According to Law</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Central Political Council yesterday, requesting the correction of the stamp tax rate. The original text reads: Nanjing Central Political Council, in the principle of the Stamp Tax Law passed by the Council last year, Article 5 states that the stamp duty should be heavier for certificates that have greater effect or rights, or that are used for a longer period, and the stamp duty should be lighter for certificates that have lesser effect or rights, or that are used for a shorter period. Article 6 states that certificates of frequent acts should mostly adopt a simple and easy fixed-rate tax, and certificates of rare acts should mostly adopt an easy-to-calculate progressive tax. It is now reported that the Stamp Tax Law decided by the Legislative Yuan, such as the most common shipping invoices, bills, and silver receipts in the business community, will be taxed one cent for those from three yuan to ten yuan, and one cent will be added for every ten yuan thereafter, up to one yuan. According to the situation, a progressive tax law is adopted, which is obviously inconsistent with Article 6 of the principles set by the Council. Compared with the current stamp tax regulations, the above items are limited to two cents, but now they are limited to one yuan. Compared with each other, the price is almost fifty times higher, and the use time of invoices and bills, with the monthly closing of accounts at the end of the month, is mostly half a month or a month, and the annual closing of accounts is only three festivals at most. It is very short, and the tax is increased up to fifty times compared to the current rate, which is also inconsistent with Article 5 of the principles set by the Council. According to the law, if a merchant has goods worth a thousand yuan, from issuing the goods and opening the account to receiving the payment, he must pay three yuan in stamp duty, which is equivalent to paying a tax of three thousandths of the price of the goods, while the current regulations require only three cents of stamp duty, regardless of the price, from issuing the goods to receiving the payment. Compared with each other, the difference is a hundred times, which is difficult for businesses to bear. It is requested to correct it quickly based on the principles decided last year.

<p>According to a Central News Agency report, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, left Beijing by night train the night before last and arrived at the North Station at 7:20 AM yesterday, going directly to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest. He then met with reporters from various newspapers at 10:30 AM. According to him, the draft constitution was passed at the second reading last Tuesday. Once it is passed at the third reading this week, it can be reported to the National Government and forwarded to the Central Government for approval. As for whether the National Congress will be convened in April next year, it will depend on the decision of the Fifth Plenary Session.

<h3 id="e91">Disaster Report <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>After the formalities were completed, Xu Shiying gave a report, saying that since the beginning of summer this year, rainfall has been out of season, and drought has been severe. The disaster situation is rare. As of September 25, the Relief Committee has repeatedly received reports from the Civil Affairs Departments of the provinces, the Relief Committee, and the county-level organizations and groups, and collected materials from the Industrial Department's Central Agricultural Experiment Institute to compile statistics. This year's drought area covers 369 counties in eleven provinces, including 74 in Jiangxi, 71 in Zhejiang, 62 in Hunan, 47 in Anhui, 32 in Jiangsu, 24 in Hubei, 23 in Shanxi, 15 in Hebei, 11 in Henan, 8 in Gansu, and 2 in Guizhou. The affected cultivated land is about 133.83 million mu. Although there are no accurate statistics on the number of victims, it is estimated to be more than 10 million people. There are still reports arriving later. In addition, the flood disaster this year is not light. According to reports, there are about 280 counties in fourteen provinces, including Hebei, Shaanxi, and Shanxi, with about 31.025 million mu of affected cultivated land. The concise list of disaster situations in the provinces in 23 years has been compiled and sent. Although it cannot be said to be very detailed, it is enough as a reference. It is a pity that disasters have been frequent in recent years, the rural areas have been declining, and now they have suffered a great calamity. In the blink of an eye, the winter season is approaching, and there is no food or clothing. Hunger and cold are intertwined. How can our disaster-stricken people spend the end of the year? How should we plan relief to save the people's lives and consolidate the country's foundation? I sincerely ask you to express your great insights and plan together. I can't help but look forward to it.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Chairman's Speech <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Kong Xiangxi said in his speech, "Our country has been plagued by floods for years, and now it is followed by severe drought. According to a survey by the Ministry of Finance, the disaster in the Yangtze River basin is caused by the lack of rain for three or four months, resulting in barren land and people unable to make a living. People should have a spirit of mutual assistance, and should work for mankind, society, and the country. Today, all sectors of Shanghai have initiated the fundraising of the Drought Relief Association in the provinces to engage in relief and enable people all over the country to avoid freezing and starvation. However, the disaster situation is serious, and it is only possible to have economic benefits if we all make efforts together. Some compatriots are also immersed in cigarettes and alcohol, and are unwilling to contribute even a hair or a penny to relief efforts. However, disaster relief is our duty, and we should work hard to raise funds and actively carry out relief efforts. In addition to relief, we should also work hard to dredge rivers and build roads. In this way, the disaster of floods and droughts can be reduced in the future. This is the main point of today's meeting."</p>

<h3 id="e95">Fundraising Declaration <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Fundraising Declaration of the Shanghai All-Circles Drought Relief Association for the Provinces states: Since the beginning of summer this year, rainfall has been out of season, and drought has been severe. According to reports, more than 369 counties in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Gansu, Guizhou, and other provinces have been affected by disasters. More than 133 million mu of farmland have been damaged, and even water sources have been completely dry, and there has been no harvest. Families committing suicide have been repeatedly seen in newspapers, and cannibalism is likely to take shape. It is a pity that disasters have been frequent in recent years, the rural areas have been declining, and now they have suffered a great calamity. In the blink of an eye, the winter season is approaching, and there is no food or clothing. Hunger and cold are intertwined. How can our disaster-stricken people spend the end of the year? We still have a breath, and relief cannot be delayed. Saving the country starts with saving the people, and benefiting others means benefiting oneself. It is hoped that everyone will work together to overcome the famine for one year, and that people will surely overcome the heavens and look forward to a bumper harvest next year. The future of the nation depends on it. At the beginning of the establishment of this association, we swear to be sincere and compassionate, and to perform our duties in a comprehensive and strict manner. We dare to ask people of insight from all walks of life to be brave for righteousness, open their pockets to help each other, give money to send grain, save those who are drowning, and relieve the drought. Spreading benevolence to the fields is no different from giving rain, and comparing virtue to hills is not just looking forward to the clouds. I shed tears to state my case, and I hope for your public judgment.</p>

<p>The Two Railway Bureaus Invite Bids for the Construction of the Sujia Section of the Railway Branch Line</p>
<p>The Entire Line is Divided into Six Small Sections, with Earthwork Construction to Be Built First</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Railways approved the construction of the Sujia section of the railway, the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Bureaus announced yesterday that they would invite bids for the earthwork construction first, so as to start construction. It is scheduled to be completed in one year. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Invitation to Bid: The Two Railway Bureaus announced the invitation to bid for the earthwork project of the Sujia section, stating that the railway plans to connect Jiaxing from Suzhou, passing through Wujiang, Pingwang, Shengze, Wangjiangjing, and other places. The construction of the new line is 75 kilometers long and is divided into six small sections. Contractors are invited to contract the earthwork project first. All small sections will start construction at the same time. All nationals with the project experience and ability and who are registered as Class A by the provincial and municipal governments (regardless of whether they have registered with the railway or not) who are willing to contract one or more small sections may, from October 21st, receive drawings, bidding regulations, construction instructions, and bid forms from the Engineering Department of the Railway Administration Bureau, Riverside Building, North Suzhou Road, Shanghai, and pay a handling fee of three yuan and a drawing deposit of fifteen yuan. The deadline is the end of October. The bidding and opening dates will be notified when the drawings are collected. This announcement.</p>
<p>Facilitating Transportation: It is planned to start construction within the year after the bidding and complete it in one year. The funds will be allocated by the Ministry of Railways. The section starts from Suzhou Station of the Jinghu section, passes through Wujiang, Shengze, Wangjiangjing, and ends at Jiaxing Station of the Huhangyong section, connecting Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The section along the line is very important for national defense transportation, and is rich in local products. In the future, after the completion of the Huhangyong section, local products along the Zhayong section, such as vegetable oil, tin foil, Shaoxing wine, fresh fruits, grains, hemp, silk cocoons, cotton yarn, sugar, and sugarcane, can be quickly transported to North China and Central China through the Sujia section, which can shorten the travel time and avoid congestion.</p>

As for the improved varieties in Shandong and Zhejiang, although they are the first trial, the results are considerable, which is beyond our expectations. The autumn silkworm results in Jiangsu and Sichuan provinces are also very good, and the future is very promising. As for the autumn silkworm situation in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces this year, I will report after I personally go to inspect with Dr. Marie at the beginning of next month. If there are any shortcomings, I will find ways to improve them.</p>

<p>Notice to All Households to Register with the Shanghai County Government</p>
<p>The Industrial Society reports that Shanghai and Baoshan counties, bordering the river and sea, have many state-owned sandy fields. These fields have long been occupied and cultivated by local people, with reed marshes being the main product. The annual harvest is entirely privately owned by the people, and there are no fixed acreages or boundaries, leading to frequent disputes. No grain taxes have been paid, resulting in no revenue for the provincial treasury. In view of this, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance has instructed the Shanghai-Baoshan Sandy Field State Property Bureau in this city to actively engage in surveying and measuring. It also ordered the county governments of Shanghai and Baoshan to levy grain taxes on state-owned sandy fields. Yesterday, a reporter from the Industrial Society interviewed Wang Jiaolin, the director of the Sandy Field State Property Bureau. According to him, the surveying and measuring of sandy fields in the two counties is largely complete, but it has not yet been carried out for the reed marshes along the coast in the southeast of Shanghai County. The bureau has already submitted a request to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance for approval to implement the surveying and measuring. Therefore, it is planned to formally commence the work after the announcement. All state-owned land with grain in the area will be allowed to register with the Shanghai County Government, and land without grain production will also be allowed to be reported, so as to unify state-owned property. The procedures for this will be jointly announced by the bureau and the Shanghai County Government to inform the public. The county government will be responsible for handling the procedures for collecting grain taxes. The bureau's announcement is transcribed below: Announcement regarding the investigation of the reed marshes along the coast in the southeast of Shangyi (Shanghai County), which stretch far and wide and have long been occupied and cultivated by the people. This not only hinders the revenue of the provincial treasury but also makes it impossible to determine property rights, leading to confusion of boundaries and repeated disputes. This bureau has submitted a request to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, and has received Instruction No. 11502, approving the implementation of surveying and measuring in accordance with the established case of the Fengnan Bureau to facilitate clearing up. All households that have already paid the price and bear grain obligations should immediately bring their documents to the bureau for registration. Those households that occupy land with or without grain obligations are allowed to pay the price and obtain ownership certificates as soon as possible for proof of their business. All of the above must be done within twenty days from the date of this announcement. Those who violate, delay, or conceal information, and fail to report within the deadline, will have their unclaimed state-owned land re-leased by the bureau. There will be no tolerance. For the sake of solemnly protecting the property rights of the original households, the Shanghai County Government has been jointly issuing announcements. This announcement is hereby made.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Land Bureau's Real Estate Mortgage Rules Cause Disputes <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Registration Rules Clearly Conflict with Civil Law</p>
<p>All Losses Will Be Difficult to Bear in the Future</p>
<p>A document from the Shanghai Lawyers Association to the Judicial Yuan states: "Regarding the obvious conflict between the city's single regulations and the current civil law, please forward it to the Executive Yuan for an order to abolish it. Qian Zhongdao, a member of the association, writes: 'Respectfully, previously, the client Zhang Heqing stated that on November 15th of the 20th year of the Republic of China, Heqing mortgaged his own property located at No. 35 Sanyutang Humin District Sanyuan Huangziwei, consisting of one mu, three fen, four ku, and three hao of land, along with the residential buildings on it, to Zhu Hongnan. Both parties signed a real estate mortgage contract, stating a mortgage amount of 60,000 taels of silver and a mortgage term of two years. They also registered the mortgage with the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau according to the real estate mortgage regulations. However, after the mortgage, the actual amount of the mortgage silver was reduced to 40,000 taels. When the two-year term expired, the mortgagor was temporarily unable to redeem the property, and it was agreed with the mortgagee to extend the term to May 10th of this year, and then again to November 10th. Unexpectedly, the mortgagee Zhu Hongnan, while agreeing to continue the extension, independently went to the Land Bureau to transfer the property, eliminating the mortgagor's property rights. The Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau approved this unilateral action and officially notified and declared the elimination of all property rights of Sanyutang under the name of the mortgagor. This kind of unilateral action and the Land Bureau's implementation of this single regulation completely conflict with the explicit provisions of Article 873 of the Civil Law (Property Rights). One party completely loses its guarantee on the mortgaged property in fact, and Heqing loses real estate worth 100,000 yuan once due to a mortgage of 40,000 taels. Since the law does not provide for the follow-up of debt, what can be done about the loss? They had no choice but to ask the lawyers to provide legal remedies in order to recover the loss. Upon checking the judicial administrative regulations of this case, there are conflicts between the two parties, and it is impossible to follow the rules. It is known that your association has previously raised concerns with the higher judicial administrative organs regarding Article 5 of the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau's Real Estate Mortgage Registration Rules, requesting interpretation. Based on the foregoing, the member believes that the rights and responsibilities of the parties involved are at stake. Therefore, they specifically request that you forward it to the higher judicial administrative authorities, order an interpretation of the conflict in the aforementioned regulations, so that there is something to follow, and also ask your association to take steps to help and remedy the situation.' It is argued that Article 5 of the Shanghai Land Bureau's Real Estate Mortgage Registration Rules conflicts with Article 873, Section 2 of the current Civil Law. According to the principle that local regulations must not conflict with central laws, a letter was sent to the Municipal Government requesting correction. Later, a reply was received stating that the case in which your association requested the correction of the provisions of Article 5 of the Real Estate Mortgage Registration Rules of the Land Bureau of this city was approved on May 1, 20th year of the Republic of China. A letter was sent stating that it was submitted to the Judicial Yuan for submission to the Executive Yuan, ordering its abolition. Until now, this government has not received the said order, so the request is difficult to approve. The Real Estate Registration Regulations implemented by the Shanghai Land Bureau were promulgated by the Beijing Government on May 21, 11th year of the Republic of China and should be approved for adoption according to the order of the National Government on August 12, 16th year of the Republic of China.) Matters under the jurisdiction of the court as stipulated in Article 3, Section 6, it is inevitable that the land administration authorities directly conducting real estate mortgage registration will conflict with the powers of the court before the Dengji Regulations are abolished and the Land Law (promulgated on March 3, 19th year) is implemented. Furthermore, the current Civil Law, regarding the definition of mortgage rights, Article 860 of the Civil Law clearly stipulates that "immovable property that is provided as security to a creditor or a third party without transferring possession may only be compensated from the proceeds of its sale." Furthermore, Article 873, Section 1 stipulates that "If the mortgage right has reached the repayment period but has not been repaid, the mortgage may apply to the court for the auction of the mortgaged property and receive compensation from the actual proceeds of the sale." At the beginning of central legislation, the method of exercising mortgage rights was clearly marked and should not be different. Therefore, Article 873, Section 2 of the same law also stipulates that "If it is agreed that the ownership of the mortgaged property shall be transferred to the mortgagee when the debt has reached the repayment period but has not been repaid, the agreement shall be invalid." Now, Article 5 of the Real Estate Mortgage Registration Rules of the Shanghai Land Bureau stipulates that "the mortgage term shall be agreed upon by the mortgagee and the mortgagor and registered. If it is not redeemed after the expiration date, the mortgagee shall apply for transfer and be issued a land certificate in the name of the mortgagee, and the mortgagor's property rights shall be eliminated." The violation of the current regulations and the conflict with central laws are very obvious. According to Article 8 and Article 13 of the City Organization Law, the municipal government's handling of affairs and issuance of single regulations shall be limited to not conflicting with central laws. The Real Estate Mortgage Registration Rules of the Land Bureau obviously violate the Civil Law and the Registration Regulations and are naturally invalid. The association believes that the illegal local regulations easily deprive the people of their rights and interests. On April 30, 20th year of the Republic of China, it requested the court to submit a request to the Judicial Yuan for submission to the Executive Yuan, ordering its abolition. After three years, no reply has been received. Now, according to the letter from member Qian Zhongdao, the Real Estate Mortgage Registration Rules of the Shanghai Land Bureau, if they are not abolished one day, will not only affect the credibility of the central government, but it is not a small matter. The ownership of the people cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, it is requested that your department examine and approve it, and allow the submission to the Executive Yuan, ordering the Shanghai Municipal Government to abolish the Real Estate Mortgage Registration Rules approved and promulgated by the Land Bureau immediately in order to correct the matter. This is for the public convenience, and so on."</p>

Sichuan merchants, who purchased goods in Shanghai with Sichuan exchange, inevitably faced increased costs, greatly impacting sales. Consequently, they all telegraphed Sichuan businesses in Shanghai to suspend the purchase of outgoing goods and simultaneously convened discussions to find remedial measures. They decided to transport as much Sichuan native produce to Shanghai as possible to balance the Sichuan exchange rate. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired at the Juxingcheng Bank yesterday and learned that the Sichuan-Shanghai exchange rate on October 13th was 1,398 yuan of Sichuan silver per 1,000 yuan, equivalent to 1,000 yuan of Shanghai silver, a decrease of over 100 yuan from the peak, but still more than 100 yuan higher than usual. The Sichuan merchants in Shanghai, mindful of the decline in the exchange rate, have long suspended the purchase of outgoing goods. As the Sichuan inventories are about to run out, they have been purchasing seasonal goods such as woolens and cotton yarn for shipment to Sichuan in recent days.</p>

<p>Detained Crew Members to be Transferred to Shanghai for Trial</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the Shun'an Steamer Company on Zhonghua Road in this city, operating the Shun'an Steamer between Shanghai and Xinghua, had its manager, Chen Youbo, secretly colluding with the shipowner, Ouyang Tai, due to owing large sums of money. They planned to sink the ship mid-voyage to claim compensation. This was discovered by the Customs at Sandu'ao, Fujian. The ship, cargo, and key crew members were detained, and the manager, Chen Youbo, was apprehended by the company's chairman, Zheng Zhongwu, in Shanghai and sent to court for prosecution. The Dagong News Agency reporter learned from shipping authorities and customs officials that the Shun'an Steamer was indeed planning to be bombed, and also falsely declared export goods. This is an unprecedented scandal in the shipping industry. If it is not severely punished, it will greatly affect the future of commerce and the reputation of the shipping industry. Therefore, in order to prevent malpractices and serve as a warning to others, the Customs authorities have decided to confiscate the Shun'an Steamer and all its cargo. Previous rumors of its release are untrue. As for the detained shipowner, Ouyang Tai, and the chief mate, Sheng Fuchen, etc., after the Fujian Water Police Corps interrogate them at the provincial government, they will be transferred to Shanghai for handling.</p>

<p>Advance Payment to Allow Purchase of Winter Clothing</p>
<p>Yin Yu Shi, et al., 26 family members of Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Commander Wang Delin who have remained in Shanghai, intend to voluntarily move to Xin Province during the day to seek a new life. It is learned that due to the heavy snow and wind in the northwestern regions, Yin Yu Shi et al. have earnestly requested Director Zheng Xing and Councilor Xi Guojun of the Shanghai office to request the Shanghai Charitable Organizations and the United Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees to advance the previously stored severance pay to facilitate the purchase of winter clothing. Zheng and Xi, based on the circumstances, have written to the Relief Association. The original letter states, "To the esteemed Relief Association, Yin Yu Shi et al., 26 family members of our department, previously intended to return to their hometowns separately to seek a new life. We have already requested your association to allocate funds for severance pay. Now that the rebellion in Xinjiang Province has been suppressed and the western frontier is stable, each wishes to go to Xinjiang immediately so that they have a place to live. Our office has prepared a roster and sent it to General Li Zhichu, requesting him to forward it to the Central Government to arrange for their repatriation. It is believed that the Central Government, mindful of the history of the Anti-Japanese War, will not bear to see their wives separated from their children and hopes for approval. However, as these family members have not yet made clothing in this cool autumn, the snow and wind in the northwest are concerning. The only solution is to request your association to advance the stored severance pay so that each can purchase winter clothing and prepare to depart. Your association has always been known for its kindness and concern for the hungry and drowning. We hope you will grant our request and send someone to distribute the funds and sign for receipt. We will be extremely grateful."</p>

<p>Appeals to the Collegiate Bench</p>
<p>Zhang Jinbao, a murderer from Yixing, nicknamed "Long-legged Jinbao," was sentenced to 20 years in prison for killing his apprentice, Gu Daosheng, from Dachang, at the Daji Lou Restaurant on Xiaodongmen Street in the French Concession on the afternoon of March 27th of last year. The case was investigated and prosecuted by the police and the Special Second Court. Zhang was dissatisfied and appealed to the High Third Branch Court, which rejected the appeal. He is now appealing to the Supreme Court for a third trial. The person is being held in the Special Second Court Detention Center. Unexpectedly, during the previous month, he had a dispute with a fellow inmate over smoking cigarettes. A guard, Zhu Fubao, stepped forward to stop him, but Zhang not only refused to comply but also assaulted the guard, causing injury. The detention center transferred Zhang to the Prosecutor's Office of the Special Second Court for investigation. After confirmation, he was prosecuted by the same-level criminal court for obstructing official duties. After interrogation by Judge Sun Pengxian, he was sentenced to six months in prison. The above has been reported previously. Now Zhang is dissatisfied with the verdict and has appealed to the collegiate bench. The Second Criminal Court was specially convened by Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu, along with Judges Xiong and Li, and Prosecutor Wang Ren for a preliminary hearing. According to Zhang's statement of the reasons for the appeal, the gist is that he did not assault the guard at the time, but was assaulted by the guard and was instead sentenced, which he was unwilling to accept. He requested an appeal. The court verified the confession and, due to incomplete testimony, ordered a postponement to summon witnesses to testify again. Zhang was still returned to the detention center.</p>

<p>Wu Yaoou, a Western detective from the French Concession Cigarette Investigation Division of the Unified Tax Inspection Office of the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, along with Chinese detectives Zhou Baosheng, Zhu Qiming, and Zhao Chengshou, recently discovered that Qiu Mingde, a Ningbo native residing at No. 21 Sanqing Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, age 38, established the Shanghai Ningtai Xinji Tobacco Company in his residence. The Jingzhong brand cigarettes produced by the company were manufactured by the Donghai Tobacco Factory at No. 25 Kai'ai Lai Road, without reporting to the Cigarette Unified Tax Inspection Office and evading taxes for sale on the market. This constituted collusion with the Donghai Tobacco Factory to cheat, violating tax regulations. Therefore, they immediately went to Qiu's home to search and confiscated 37 packs of Jingzhong brand tax-evading cigarettes wrapped in old wax paper, as well as 68 packs of the same loose cigarettes, and moldy cigarettes, totaling 213 packs, or 28,000 cigarettes, all manufactured by the Donghai Tobacco Factory. The cigarettes, along with Qiu Mingde and Shi Shenkang (age 46, Zhejiang native), the deputy manager of the Donghai Tobacco Factory, were taken to the police station. The morning before, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special Second Court. Judge Wu Fanglian interrogated them. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang explained the case, and prosecuted them according to Articles 27, Section 5 and 10 of the Penalties for Tax-Evading Cigarettes of the Unified Tax Inspection Office of the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance. Detective Zhu Qiming reported the search process and presented the confiscated tax-evading cigarettes to the court. The defendants, Qiu Mingde and Shi Shenkang, admitted to evading taxes for sale and manufacturing cigarettes on behalf of others. The court verified the confession and immediately announced the judgment: Qiu Mingde and Shi Shenkang were fined 150 yuan each for colluding to sell cigarettes wrapped in wax paper with false stamps to evade taxes. The confiscated tax-evading cigarettes were confiscated and turned over to the state.</p>

<p>Ding Yanlong, from Xuzhou, was found in possession of sixty red pills of drugs at noon on the 10th of this month while passing through the jurisdiction of the Fifth Police Station of the Third District of Zhabei. He was apprehended by police detective Zheng Bucai, who learned that the red pills were purchased from Zhengchangxiang Tobacco and Paper Shop at No. 247 Oujia Road in the Public Concession. Detective Zheng immediately went to the Jiaxing Road Police Station to request assistance in apprehending the shopkeeper. The police chief sent detective Zhao Lianbi secretly to arrest Chen Guifa, a Haiyan native who owned the shop. He learned that there was a distribution point at No. 243 on the same road, and then arrested his partner, Zhou Shuangfu, and confiscated a large number of red pills. They were taken to the police station together. The next morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. The two defendants gave evasive confessions. The Municipal Council lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that the defendants' addresses were all in the concession and did not need to be transferred. It was ordered to return them to custody. The other day, Judge Xiao Xiehan came to the Third Criminal Court to take confessions clearly, and sentenced Chen Guifa to one year and six months in prison and a fine of one hundred yuan, and Zhou Shuangfu to one year and six months. The evidence was confiscated.</p>

<p>Originally the Husband's Cousin</p>
<p>Jin Gu Shi (age 21), wife of Jin Qinsheng (age 19), a local residing at No. 25 Chengjiazhai near Xinxing in northwestern Shanghai, left home at 5:40 AM on September 19th to go to work at the Minsheng Yarn Factory. While walking to the area of Huobilan Road and Younigan Road, a man blocked her way and snatched two gold rings, and fired four shots, two of which hit her shoulder and back, causing her to fall to the ground. The Sixth District sent a police car to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment and ordered the arrest of the thief. It is learned that after the doctors tried to save Jin Gu Shi (one said she had died), it has been nearly a month, and she has now slightly recovered and has been taken home by her family. Before being shot, she witnessed that the man who attacked her was Jin Bosun, the husband's cousin who lived in the same house at No. 13, who was chasing her with a gun. After the incident, Bosun hid in the concession. Unexpectedly, the net of justice is far-reaching. Yesterday morning, Bosun secretly returned to his hometown to visit and was discovered by the woman, who reported it to the Beixinxing Police Station. The police dispatched officers to arrest Jin Bosun and notified the Caojiadu Branch. Director Wang immediately ordered the detectives Wu Kezhong and Cao Chuqiao to retrieve the suspect Jin Bosun. It is said that the case involves a vendetta and is currently under investigation.</p>

<p>The Tongrenhe Paint Shop at No. 80 Minguo Road, French Concession, has recently been selling a red candlestick brand of powdered red pigment. Mr. Lai Anha, the British manager of Defu Foreign Firm at No. 261 Sichuan Road, discovered that the shop was selling this kind of goods, which had fake Defu Foreign Firm trademarks, affecting business. The French police were reported to have sent detectives to the Tongrenhe Paint Shop to search and confiscated 3,500 sheets of fake trademark signs, along with the shop owner Xu Chengxun, to the case and transferred it to the Special Second Court.

The other day, Judge Wu Fanglian interrogated the case in the Eighth Criminal Court. First, the police lawyer stated the police investigation process and presented the confiscated trademark signs to the court. Then, the plaintiff stated that the defendant was faking trademarks. The defendant Xu Chengxun stated that after the goods were ordered from Defu Foreign Firm, he obtained the plaintiff's consent to repackage them into small cans for sale.

<p>Dai Peilin, a Ningbo native residing in the back building of No. 99 Zihua Road near the Nine Mu Land in Shanghai City, has a habit of smoking opium. Recently, due to long-term unemployment and the high price of opium, he switched to eating red pills and privately set up a smoking den in his home, providing people with red pills and foreign tobacco to maintain his life. Someone secretly reported this to the Shenxiangge Police Station. Director Shen immediately sent the police chief to sneak into the house through the back door of the number at 7:00 PM the other night. He went straight upstairs. At that time, the smokers were lying on their beds, smoking and puffing clouds. The police chief arrested Dai and six smokers together, along with two red pill guns, one opium pipe, one opium lamp, and the remaining red pills. They were taken to the police station and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation by the Third Section. As the case was related to private drug use, they were transferred to the Garrison Command for military trial yesterday.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Meihua Film Company has been intensely engaged in filming. Recently, due to the company's leading actress, Ms. Pan Wenxia, filming for the Shanghai Film Company, a criminal lawsuit was filed with the First Special District Court. The trial opened in the First Criminal Court at 3:50 PM the day before yesterday (the 13th). The plaintiff, Zhu Ruifeng, accompanied by his attorney, Tang Hao, appeared in court and was questioned by Judge Liu Yukui. The defendant, Pan Wenxia, did not appear because her address was unclear and the summons could not be delivered. The plaintiff's attorney stated that the Meihua Film Company had a contract with Pan Wenxia. In addition to providing a fixed salary, the company also provided food, lodging, and travel expenses for filming outside of Shanghai. Moreover, a percentage of all film profits would be given as compensation, which was quite generous. However, on September 28th, Pan Gongxia was invited by Zhou Yinong of Yunrong Clothing Company to film for the Shanghai Film Company. Attempts to stop her were unsuccessful, causing direct and indirect harm to the company. The defendant's behavior constitutes the crime of breach of trust under Article 366 of the Criminal Code, and the plaintiff requested legal action be taken. Judge Liu, noting the defendant's absence, adjourned the trial to the 20th for further hearing.</p>

<p>Should Be Under the Jurisdiction of the District Court</p>
<p>Police Lawyer Drops Appeal</p>
<p>Last month, on the 15th at 4:30 PM, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Dixiwei Road police station cracked down on a red pill drug manufacturing operation at 59 Doulan Road. The main offender, Japanese national Ikeda, escaped without a trace upon hearing the news. Only three workers, Wang Asan from Wuxi, Hang Xiqing from Ningbo, and Zhang Asan from the local area, were arrested. Suspect Japanese national Gai Li was subsequently apprehended and sent to the Japanese consulate for questioning. The three workers, Wang, Zhang, and Hang, were handed over to the First Special District Court. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xiefen, it was determined that the address of 59 Doulan Road fell within the Chinese territory and was outside the court's jurisdiction. The three defendants were ordered to be held pending transfer to the Shanghai District Court for trial. The Municipal Council lawyer, Li Zhishan, requested that they remain in custody during the appeal period. The day before yesterday, Lawyer Li submitted a request to the Third Criminal Court, stating that he would not appeal and requesting that the defendants be transferred to the court's civil detention center to await extradition. Mr. Xiao approved the request.</p>

At that time, Wang had already heard strange noises and was coming out of the room to investigate when the thief with a gun was already in front of him, forbidding him to make a sound. The thief empty-handed immediately snatched over 400 yuan and fled. Wang was unwilling to let them go and followed them, shouting "Catch the thief!" At that time, Russian Constable No. 86 of the French police station happened to hear the alarm and arrived, firing a shot. A bullet hit the empty-handed thief's right shoulder, and he fell to the ground and was captured. The stolen goods were recovered and brought to the police station.

<h3 id="e135">Four Major Oil Companies Plot to Monopolize the Market and Boycott Diesel Fuel Refining into Kerosene <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Sales Will Be Stopped Immediately Upon Discovery</p>
<p>Gasoline Sales Have Suddenly Increased in Recent Months</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, after the kerosene market in China was monopolized by the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia, the market price once fell. However, after the four major companies agreed on a distribution agreement, prices were immediately raised uniformly. Recently, they have jointly boycotted the refining of diesel fuel into kerosene and plan to actively promote the gasoline market. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Boycott of Diesel Fuel Refining into Kerosene: It is reported that the four major kerosene companies in China, Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum, Deuto-Gubkin, and Guanghua, have recently learned that Chinese people have successfully refined kerosene from diesel fuel, which they believe will greatly harm their kerosene business. Therefore, they have united to boycott it. The method is that the diesel fuel sold by each company in the future will only be used for machinery needs. If buyers are found to be refining kerosene, their right to purchase will be terminated. If companies sell it privately, they will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Gasoline Sales Suddenly Increase: It is also reported that the gasoline sold by each company has recently seen a sharp increase in use due to the gradual development of highway construction in China. The sales volume is becoming more active every day. The original national sales volume per month was 500,000 to 700,000 gallons, but in recent days, it has surged to about one million gallons. It is said that each company is also planning to actively promote its market in order to recover the losses during the period of competitive sales.</p>

<h3 id="e143">The Case of Two Women Arguing Over Position After Cheng Zhong'an's Death <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Each Side Has Witnesses for Who Is the First Wife</p>
<p>The Purpose of the Lawsuit Is All About Money</p>
<p>丨The Judge Divides the Money for Both Parties丨</p>
<p>Cheng Zhong'an, a native of Sichuan, was a foreign goods broker who traveled between Shanghai, Beijing, and other places. He was extremely capable. After several years of operation, he accumulated a lot of wealth. This spring, Cheng Zhong'an and his nephew Fan Weisheng went to Beijing for trade. Unfortunately, he died of illness there in March, leaving behind tens of thousands of gold. However, Cheng had two wives during his lifetime, one was Li Abao (i.e., Cheng Li's), and the other was Jiang Yueying (i.e., Cheng Jiang's). Both lived in Shanghai, living separately. At that time, Fan immediately sent a letter to the two women, reporting the bad news. Li Abao and Jiang Yueying, after receiving the letter, had an identity problem due to the inheritance relationship, and each filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court, slandering each other and demanding confirmation of Cheng Zhong'an's first wife. Each had their own reasons and presented marriage witnesses. Who exactly was the formal couple was not known to outsiders. Li Abao claimed to have been married to Cheng Zhong'an for twelve years and had a daughter who was eleven years old. She accused Jiang of being a concubine. However, Jiang Yueying claimed that she and Cheng were actually formally married, accusing Li Abao of being a casual union. The two sides attacked each other. After the court accepted the case, it had been hearing the case several times without a conclusion. The day before yesterday, Judge Han Zuoti continued to hear the case. First, witness Fan Weisheng testified, 27 years old, from Sichuan, doing medicinal material business. In 1924, my uncle Cheng Zhong'an asked me to come to Shanghai from my hometown and live with him. (Question) Who is your aunt? (Answer) Jiang Yueying. (Question) Who was the matchmaker? (Answer) I heard it was Wang Zhiya. (Question) In what year and where did they get married? (Answer) I heard it was in 1913, at Xiangfa Zhan near Zhengjia Muqiao. (Question) How much was the betrothal gift? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) Was the marriage time in the first half of the year or the second half of the year? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) Do you know Li Abao? (Answer) She is my little aunt, and she started living together in 1926. (Question) Your uncle died in March of this year. How much property did he leave behind? (Answer) At Jiang Yueying's place, there is a passbook from the Bank of China, totaling 1,500 yuan, and at Li Abao's place, there is a passbook from the Juxingcheng Bank, also for 1,500 yuan. (Question) Who has the passbook now? (Answer) Both are in Jiang Yueying's hands. Next, witness Wang Zhiya testified, 48 years old, and a friend of Cheng Zhong'an. I was the matchmaker for Jiang Yueying. (Question) How much was the matchmaker fee? (Answer) Sixty yuan. (Question) When did they get married? (Answer) In 1913, at Xiangfa Zhan in Zhengjia Muqiao. (Question) Did Cheng Zhong'an have a wife in Sichuan? (Answer) No. (Question) Who is Li Abao? (Answer) A mistress. (Question) Did she live with Cheng Zhong'an? (Answer) Yes. The interrogating officer obtained the confession. At the previous hearing, the witnesses presented by Li Abao proved that Li Abao and Cheng Zhong'an formally held a wedding ceremony twelve years ago, as if it were true. Today's witness also proves that Jiang Yueying is the formal couple. Which is right and which is wrong has already been preliminarily determined. In short, this lawsuit was started because of the money issue. Questioning Jiang Yueying how much money is in your account, she answered 3,000 yuan, etc. The officer said to Jiang Yueying, is the bank passbook with you? (Answer) They are all with me. (Question) How much is the amount? (Answer) A total of 3,000 yuan. Li Abao confessed that there is still property worth 40,000 to 50,000 in Beijing. Please order Fan Weisheng to hand it over. The officer said to Fan, how much property is there in Beijing? (Answer) Although there was 40,000 to 50,000 gold before, my uncle suffered repeated failures in business in Beijing and owed a lot of money. After repaying the debts, there are only 6,000 yuan left, which is not easy to collect for a while, etc. The interrogating officer obtained the confession and said to the two women, the current 3,000 yuan will be divided equally between the two parties. However, Li Abao has one more child and should get 500 yuan more, for a total of 3,000 yuan. Regarding the property in Beijing, order Fan Weisheng to quickly hand over all the account books to the case for inspection. Fan complied and left the court.</p>

They came to Shanghai and stayed at the Wu Tongchun Inn in Wangjia Lane, Danfeng Road. Because they were unfamiliar with Shanghai, they entrusted Yang Zinan, a fellow villager living at No. 2 Wangjia Lane, to apply for passports and ship tickets for them to go abroad. Each person paid Yang Zinan more than 300 yuan, totaling more than 3,000 yuan for ten people. More than a month has passed, and Yang first made empty promises, then avoided meeting them altogether. Zhou Yihong and others went to Yang's house repeatedly to inquire and urge him. Yesterday, Yang's wife, Ms. Wu, gave them a ship ticket to Tianjin. They did not see the other passports. When they questioned Yang's wife, Ms. Wu, she claimed not to know anything. They realized that Yang Zinan had already escaped without a trace. Therefore, Zhou Yihong and Zhou Yingluo went to the Yimiao Police Station and accused Yang Zinan of fraud under false pretenses. Chief Liu sent police chief Wang Xiufeng to detain Yang's wife, Ms. Wu, at the station. During interrogation, she claimed not to know anything and did not know where her husband was hiding. The case involves accusations of fraud under false pretenses and has been transferred to the bureau for legal handling.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Awakening to National Self-Reliance and Revival (3) <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— By Zhang Yuanruo</p>
<p>丨At the China Vocational Education Society丨</p>
<p>4.  The Motivation for Creating Self-Reliance: Why should I create self-reliance? What is the motivation? It can be discussed in four points: (1) In light of the emptiness of past national salvation movements, most of the so-called "movements" that are currently popular are, as Shanghainese say, a "rotten chorus," with no real substance. Some people say one thing with their mouths but think another in their hearts. During speeches, they are tearful and passionate, but when they turn around, they are laughing and joking, as if the nation does not exist and is irrelevant to them. Only personal vanity and self-interest matter to them. They are good at singing high-sounding tunes, but when it comes to doing real work, they are irresponsible. (2) In light of the national psychology of decline, the spirit of the people today can truly be described as flagging and very decadent. When doing things, they observe each other, shirk responsibility, and even criticize and undermine others while doing nothing themselves. On the other hand, when they see rights, they rush to the front. This can be seen when buying train tickets. Self-reliance is about emphasizing the obligations of the people, invigorating the spirit of the people, and inspiring the people's enthusiasm for saving and building the nation. (3) Based on the historical lessons of the nation, this point is too long to discuss in detail. Now, I can only briefly discuss it from both positive and negative sides. From the negative side, as I just said, the weakness of the Chinese nation is its susceptibility to the control of social inertia, which prevents national strength from developing and the country from having power. From the positive side, we can see that every nation in the world survives through self-improvement and hard work. In ancient times, King Goujian of Yue's "ten years of accumulation, ten years of training," where "training" refers to spiritual effort and "accumulation" refers to material effort. His efforts in education, economy, and all aspects resulted in the salvation of his country. To give a more recent example, after Germany was defeated by Napoleon, there was a philosopher named Fichte who said, "If we want to save the country and avenge our humiliation, we must first cultivate new seeds for the nation and bury ourselves in hard work for more than twenty years." From that moment on, the German people, from top to bottom, worked hard little by little, and eventually they defeated France. More recently, consider the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plans, both the first and the second. Which one was not about strengthening its national power? The longer they prepared, the more confident they became in defeating others. The Soviet Union understood the importance of national power, so it was advantageous for them to delay the war. Japan, on the other hand, was in favor of a quick war because they were already prepared. They had been working hard since the Meiji Restoration and were catching up head-on. The week before last, Mr. Wu Zhihui wrote an article in the Shanghai Morning Post, which included a passage saying that the progress of the Japanese in the past sixty years was truly astonishing. Eighty years ago, the Japanese did not even know what coal was. This statement was found by Mr. Wu in a major British newspaper and is not an exaggeration. At that time, Japan was oppressed by everyone, just like us. Since then, it has made every effort to carry out reforms, first defeating China, then defeating Russia, and now it is famous throughout the world. Even Russia, Britain, America, and France dare not lightly try to provoke it. In these sixty years, it has not only worked hard but has also caught up head-on. The whole country, regardless of men, women, old, or young, scholars, farmers, workers, or merchants, is working hard and burying themselves in their tasks, which is why it has such astonishing national strength today. Therefore, if a country wants to be successful and strong, it must undergo a long period of forging and preparation before it can succeed. It must not indulge in wishful thinking and seek luck, hoping to realize our ideals overnight. (4) Based on my advocacy over the years, although the articles I have published over the years cannot be considered good, I am not singing high-sounding tunes. I am sincerely speaking the truth. The creation of this self-reliance principle was on New Year's Day this year because I had many thoughts in my mind on New Year's Eve. I thought that with the start of the new year, the old year had passed. At this stage of carrying on the past and opening up the future, how should I strive for my new life? How should I reflect on my past mistakes? During my reflection, I came to a principle of effort, which is to save the country through self-reliance. At the same time, when we examine our previous articles, we also find a central idea. Although there are no words for self-reliance, they all contain the meaning of self-reliance. On the morning of New Year's Day, I picked up my pen and wrote an outline of self-reliance, which is divided into forty-five chapters. This is the process of my creating self-reliance.</p>
<p>5.  The Definition and Content of Self-Reliance: The definition of self-reliance, in the most popular way, is a national salvation doctrine based on obligations and responsibilities, with the nation and society as the targets, and with national mobilization and self-improvement as the means. Its function is to touch the hearts of every citizen, inspire the nation-building enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of every citizen. Under this doctrine, every citizen should assume his or her responsibility to the country. Therefore, simply put, self-reliance is a kind of "actionism," a kind of "national actionism." When it comes to its content, it is very complicated. It can be roughly divided into four parts. The first part is the theory of self-reliance, which is divided into several chapters, such as the worldview of self-reliance, the historical view of self-reliance, the social view of self-reliance, the legal view of self-reliance, the national character of self-reliance, the timeliness of self-reliance, and the philosophical foundation of self-reliance. The second part is the comparison of self-reliance with various doctrines, such as the comparison of self-reliance with socialism, the comparison of self-reliance with liberalism and individualism, the comparison of self-reliance with democracy, and the comparison of self-reliance with fascism. The third part is about the movement of self-reliance, which is divided into the awakening of Chinese youth to save the country through self-reliance, the awakening of Chinese intellectuals to save the country through self-reliance, the awakening of Chinese farmers, workers, and merchants to save the country through self-reliance, and the awakening of Chinese civil servants to save the country through self-reliance, etc. This part focuses on how to promote the program of self-reliance and provides guidance to the entire population on how to strive. The fourth part is about the beliefs and creeds of self-reliance, which also has six or seven chapters. This is the outline of my self-reliance content. To speak in detail, it is impossible to finish in one day.</p>
<p>6.  The Philosophical Foundation of Self-Reliance: I have very little research on philosophy and dare not say that I have any special insights. Moreover, I am now limited by time and can only talk about it very simply. (1) There is a Chinese saying, "Heaven moves with strength, and gentlemen strive for self-improvement without ceasing." The Chinese word "Heaven" has a very profound meaning, but from the perspective of our legal understanding, it can be regarded as a kind of "natural law." Gentlemen are relatively conscious and healthy people, such as all of you who came here to listen to the lecture in the heavy rain. You can all be considered gentlemen. As for the way of self-improvement, the most important thing is to never stop. If you are strong today but not tomorrow, you cannot be considered a gentleman. Because you have an exam tomorrow, you temporarily cram today, which does not count as self-improvement. Similarly, because of the stimulation of foreign aggression, you are temporarily passionate, crying bitterly, but after the event passes, you do not strive for improvement, which is also not self-improvement. Such people cannot be considered gentlemen. A gentleman must always strive without stopping for self-improvement. This is the natural law that Heaven has arranged for us. If we humans want to survive, we must follow this heavenly way, this natural law, and strive for self-improvement. Therefore, my self-reliance is based on this great, permanent, and universal natural law. I can say that self-reliance is not created by me; it is a natural principle, not my subjective invention, but a purely objective discovery. Therefore, if you do not strive for self-improvement, you are violating the way of Heaven, violating natural law, and you are not a gentleman. Even if you are a petty person, a petty person is a term that everyone does not like to hear. If you want to be a gentleman, you should embrace self-reliance. Speaking of natural law, although it has been criticized, it still has great power in modern legal philosophy. There is a movement in the French legal community called "the revival of natural law." Therefore, my thinking cannot be considered outdated and can even represent a new trend. In Chinese history, my doctrine also has a basis, such as Wang Yangming's theory of "unity of knowledge and action." In light of the fact that the people of the country were harming the country with empty words and not focusing on practical matters, he used the theory of unity of knowledge and action to correct the decadent and depressed psychology of the general public. It is said that the strength of the Japanese nation also benefited greatly from Wang Yangming's theory of unity of knowledge and action, which can further prove the great importance of my self-reliance to national revival. Secondly, Sun Yat-sen's theory of "knowing is difficult, doing is easy" can also be said to be the philosophical foundation of self-reliance. Regarding this point, everyone can read Sun Wen's theory, so I won't talk about it much. (2) In the West, my self-reliance also has its philosophical basis. The origins of Western philosophy can be divided into two major schools: the Christian thought and the Greek thought. The characteristics of Christian thought are: (1) dogmatic belief, (2) subjective tendency, (3) spiritual asceticism, (4) divine, absolute obedience, (5) authoritarianism, (6) heavenly kingdom theocentrism, (7) altruism, (8) supernaturalism, (9) moral and religious. The characteristics of Greek thought are exactly the opposite of Christian thought: (1) objective, (2) scientific, skeptical, and experimental, (3) corporeal and instinctual, (4) personal self-awareness, (5) liberalism, (6) self-satisfaction, (7) naturalism, (8) intellectual and artistic, (9) present-day human-centered. Speaking of the origins of the two schools of thought, Greek thought is very ancient, while Christian thought is relatively new. Although European philosophical thought has undergone thousands of changes, it has always been inseparable from the origins of these two schools of thought. Even the latest Fascism and Marxist Communism cannot be separated from the scope of these two schools of thought. Therefore, Western philosophical thought, when analyzed, is generally nothing more than these two schools. Although I am not a person who studies philosophy, I cannot help but study the relationship between Western philosophical thought and their social development, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of these two schools of thought in their history, and draw a conclusion. The progress of Western science was launched after the Renaissance movement in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The driving force behind its revival was Greek thought, because during the European Middle Ages, everyone was obscured by Christianity, superstitiously believing in God and becoming slaves of monks, without the awareness of their own efforts, thus creating a dark state everywhere. This is the famous Dark Age in history. During this era, all sciences, arts, literature, and thought could not develop. Europe at that time was really terrible. At this time, someone came out to correct the bias and remedy the deficiencies, and revived the Greek thought that had been buried for more than a thousand years. The reason why Greek thought was overwhelmed by Christian thought in the past was that it emphasized too much the development of individualism and the satisfaction of the flesh, to the extreme of licentiousness, resulting in the decline of Rome. At that time, Christian thought emerged in response to the times, correcting the then selfish and licentious individualism. However, Christian thought also obliterated the development of personality too much, and also created the darkness of the Middle Ages. Thus, the Renaissance movement revived Greek thought again, emphasizing individuality and making individuals self-aware. From this, it can be seen that Western philosophical thought has its own advantages and disadvantages, and there is no perfect one. After the Renaissance, two flowers were produced: (A) the Industrial Revolution, in which all materials were fully developed, creating their material civilization; (B) the French Revolution, which promoted the improvement of political and social systems in various countries. However, now, European thought has been stimulated by the ills of modern society, triggering an epoch-making mutation. The concrete manifestation of this mutation, belonging to the left wing, is the Soviet Communist Revolution, and belonging to the right wing is Fascism (see my Modern Legal System Overview, published by Commercial Press). Although the natures of these two doctrines are extremely different, they have several spirits in common, such as implementing dictatorship, not tolerating doubt, and not tolerating freedom, which are all more or less the same. This is the great change in modern Western thought. The world now seems to be in turmoil again, but this turmoil is actually just returning to its original path. Therefore, Westerners' thoughts, when exposed as a Western magic lantern show, change back and forth, but in the end, it is the same old trick, nothing rare. There is now a group of people who specialize in speculation. Seeing that this thing has risen, they throw it out; seeing that that thing is cheap, they buy it in. People who go to the stock exchange all want to get rich, but as a result, many people end up throwing themselves into the Huangpu River. At the same time, people who do political work are also just as pitiful. Seeing new things from abroad, they desperately buy them in and vigorously promote them, but as a result, they are never successful. If this continues and we do not establish our own doctrines but blindly follow others, the result may be more than just sending 400 million people to the Huangpu River. This is how dangerous it is. We must plan for the nation for a hundred years or a thousand years. Speculating all the time will not work. Therefore, I do not buy in or sell out, doing that kind of get-rich business. I advocate being impartial and fair, getting the best of both worlds. Since we have already experienced the advantages and disadvantages of Greek thought and Christian thought from historical experience, we should take the strengths and discard the weaknesses, correct the bias and remedy the deficiencies, to adjust it. My self-reliance, on the one hand, takes "obligations and responsibilities" as its foundation, and on the other hand, takes the country and society as its object, so on the one hand, it does not allow personal selfishness and self-interest, and on the other hand, it does not obliterate self-development. In altruism, obedience, belief, and all other aspects, it is similar to Christian thought, and in personal self-awareness, it is consistent with Greek thought, but in freedom and the spirit of self-satisfaction, it is contrary to Greek thought. Therefore, on the philosophical foundation, my self-reliance can be said to be a product of adjusting the two major Western philosophical thoughts by taking the strengths and discarding the weaknesses, correcting the bias and remedying the deficiencies.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Not Understanding the Drifting, Peeking at the Door Pities the Young Girl, Wishing to Hear of the Hardships, Cherishing Jade, Visiting the Poor Home</p>
<p>Li Shilian pointed to the tea room attendant at the door of the tea room and said, "You can ask him and you will understand." The attendant smiled and came in and whispered, "We have several business girls here. Does Mr. Zhang want to see them? One of them, who was standing in the courtyard just now, is also from another province, an official stranded in Xi'an." When Zhang Jiefu heard this, a few diagonal lines of laughter appeared on his face, and he asked, "If I call them in to take a look, how much will it cost?" Before the attendant could answer, Li Shilian laughed and said, "We are here to seek a position, and we haven't earned a penny yet, but we are going to spend such frivolous money here. Wouldn't that be too meaningless?" Zhang Jiefu laughed and said, "I'm just curious and want to take a look." Li Shilian laughed and said, "If you say you are curious, I can introduce someone to you to see." So he told him everything he had seen about the refugee girl and what Jia Duocai had reported. The attendant next to him said, "Oh, saying others don't know, but mentioning No. 8 Wangjia Alley, that's at Aunt Hu's house with bound feet. What don't we know? Most of the clothes here are sent to her to wash. That's right, today I saw several women coming to her house, probably the ones Mr. Li is talking about, right? That's easy to see. I'll bring him here tomorrow, without spending any money." When Zhang and Li heard that they didn't have to spend money, they both agreed. Their conversation was overheard by Cheng Zhiqian. He thought to himself, "These people either want to scheme for a small official position or calculate other people's women. It's a bit annoying to listen to it here." So he strolled out the door to see what they were doing. These two were quick-witted and thought that he was someone who had dealings with the director, and there would always be times when they needed to ask him for help. They should not show any improper behavior in front of him. So they both put away their smiles, and Zhang Jiefu struck up a conversation and said, "Ah! These two Germans are really spending a lot of money. They still want to eat Western food in this kind of place." (39)</p>
<h3 id="e168">A Year of Good Scenery <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— By Zhai Xiufeng</p>
<p>Su Shi's poem says, "A year of good scenery you must remember, especially when oranges are yellow and tangerines are green."</p>
<p>A friend who has traveled all over the Minjiang and Pearl River basins said, "In the deep autumn of the South, it is still hot, but you can sweat less. The lush green leaves are also thinner than in summer, which makes them even more lovely. And the oranges and tangerines, which are specialties of the South, are red and yellow, and pile up on the branches, almost breaking the branches. It is truly a spectacle."</p>
<p>Originally, the scenery of the South is worthy of people's praise, especially the oranges and tangerines of Southern China, which have thin skin and precious taste, with no veins sticking to the skin, and no residue left after eating, which is enough to make people admire. Haimen, which faces the river and the sea, only produces tangerines because of the soil and climate. They taste sour, and fewer people like to eat them, but the orange-yellow color is also extremely beautiful.</p>
<p>One day, I took a leisurely walk in the countryside, and at the corner of a thatched house, I saw a middle-aged woman who was about to wither, scolding her eight- or nine-year-old son, who had a sallow complexion. The child was just crying. It turned out that the middle-aged woman had sold a tree of tangerines to a fruit vendor in exchange for a few days' worth of food. The child, who did not understand the ways of the world, was crying and making a fuss because he wanted to keep them for himself to eat, which angered her, and she beat him fiercely a few times.</p>
<p>The real society is like hell. An innocent child, of course, does not understand the hardships of the real society.</p>
<p>"If you don't have food, you will starve to death. If you don't have tangerines to eat, you won't starve to death! You want to keep the tangerines and don't want to sell them. Do you want to eat or not?..." I walked away and still heard her half-scolding and half-teaching.</p>
<p>"If you don't have tangerines to eat, you won't starve to death!" Ah, a year of good scenery you must remember, is this a snapshot of a year of good scenery?</p>
<h3 id="e169">Drops <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— (Jian Fen)</p>
<p>Don't look down on drops! Drops are the mother of all things in the universe. Believe it or not! High mountains and continents are based on a little sand and soil, and vast oceans begin with a drop of rainwater; believe it? Drops are the mother of all things in the universe.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Picking Ginkgo Fruits <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>In the early autumn evenings, the shouts of vendors selling hot ginkgo fruits disturbed the streets and alleys, attracting children to take out their money to buy them.</p>
<p>In my hometown, Songjiang, there were also vendors selling hot ginkgo fruits. However, the ginkgo fruits they sold were not like those sold by vendors in Shanghai, who bought raw ones from dried goods stores and stir-fried them. Instead, they contracted the tree from the tree owner and picked them themselves. Because in my hometown, there are many ginkgo trees, and every summer, the branches are full of fruits, like grapes. When a strong wind blows, they will also fall like raindrops, hurting people's heads.</p>
<p>Speaking of the ginkgo fruits we eat, what we eat is not actually the fruit flesh, but the kernel. Because when the ginkgo fruit first forms, it is the size of a plum, with a green skin and black spots. Its fruit flesh is not only sour and astringent and inedible, but even if it touches a person's skin, it will peel off a layer of skin. Therefore, when ginkgo fruits are first picked, they must first be soaked in water to rot the fruit flesh, and then the kernels are picked up, dried, and then used.</p>
<p>The villagers believe that ginkgo trees are possessed by spirits, so before picking the fruits, they burn incense, light candles, and offer three animals, kowtowing respectfully several times before daring to climb the tree with a long ladder and then use a long pole to knock down the clusters of fruits.</p>
<p>The way villagers buy ginkgo fruits from tree owners is also commendable. They agree on a price when the fruits are forming, pay a deposit, and pay the full amount when they are ripe and picked. Whether the ginkgo fruits ripen well or poorly, how many are harvested, depends on fate, and neither side regrets it. Moreover, after the villagers pick the fruits, they will definitely send a few pounds to the tree owner, and the host and guest are courteous and harmonious, which is rare in all kinds of transactions!</p>
<h3 id="e171">An Illustrated Water Margin <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Binghe</p>
<p>Shi Nai'an's Water Margin, the characters depicted within, some speculate were based on Gong Shengyu's eulogies for thirty-six figures. According to records within the "Guixin Zashi", such as the eulogy for Guan Sheng, which states: "Guan Sheng, with his great blade, could he be a descendant of Yun Chang? Yun Chang was righteous and brave; you are his posterity." Thus, Water Margin, in its writing, resembles Yun Chang's appearance. After Gong's eulogies, there were further illustrated eulogies by Chen Zhanghou and Du Jin of the Ming Dynasty. The Du version had a Qing Dynasty early Guangbai Songzhai edition, totaling one hundred and six figures. The Chen version had a Zuigengtang edition (also known as "An Illustrated Water Margin," a Ming Dynasty edition, rarely circulated), starting from Song Jiang to Xu Ning, totaling forty figures. Both books' eulogies are quite readable. Now, I transcribe two from the Chen version as follows:</p>
<p>"On a peach blossom horse, a pomegranate skirt, a heroine with a silken parasol." – Hu Sanniang</p>
<p>"Carrying a gourd, singing a partridge song, a tavern woman of the Hu." – Gu Dasao</p>
<p>Recently, according to a Tianjin dispatch from the Outer Theories Agency: "A large number of female bandits have been discovered within Yu Tian County. ... It is reported that the bandits' military equipment is extremely sophisticated, all are capable female soldiers who use their beautiful appearances to carry out seduction to accomplish their robberies." Considering the recent rampant banditry in eastern Luan, these female bandits, in particular, greatly resemble the style of Hu Sanniang and Gu Dasao. The so-called "using their beautiful appearances to carry out seduction" probably starts with impersonating something similar to tavern women of the Hu. As for carrying out robbery, that is simply a heroine with a silken parasol. An Illustrated Water Margin. Although it depicts the heroes of Liangshan Marsh vividly, it ultimately stained the history of the Song Dynasty with a political blemish. And now, we especially do not wish to discover a newly illustrated Water Margin under the Kuomintang's rule of the Blue Sky with a White Sun.</p>

<h3 id="e172">The Ephemeral Record of Imperial Fragrance <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Original Author Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>That's quite true! The Three Eastern Provinces and the Chinese mainland are indeed one family. Previously, there may have been some separation, but since the Qing Dynasty established its capital, the various characteristics of the people of the Three Eastern Provinces have been almost entirely assimilated by the people of the central plains. Where else is there a difference?</p>
<p>"At the end of the Ming Dynasty," the Empress Dowager's conversational floodgates were opened wide due to this sentiment. "There was a General Wu Sangui stationed here, standing in opposition to us. Unexpectedly, at that time, the interior of China was being disturbed by roving bandits beyond imagination. Not only were the government troops unable to suppress them, but they were repeatedly defeated by them. Finally, even Emperor Chongzhen's throne gradually became untenable. So General Wu sent people to us to borrow troops for aid. We immediately agreed. He even personally opened the gates, welcoming us in. From then on, we drove straight in, obtaining the entire empire. This was a great unexpected harvest! However, from then on, the complete integration of the Chinese mainland and the Three Eastern Provinces may not have been a blessing for both sides."</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager lingered on the small mountain for more than an hour. By the time we were all tired of gazing, Her Old Ladyship was still enthusiastically gazing into the distance. Later, she suddenly issued a very peculiar order, saying that she wanted to go to the seaside to see where the Great Wall enters the sea. I could not figure out why she would specifically want to inspect that insignificant part.</p>
<p>"In the past," she pointed to those dilapidated remains and said in a tone of emotion, "this part of the Great Wall along the coast was built particularly strong compared to other places. The area is also particularly large, as if it was also meant to serve as a long seawall." (149)</p>

<p>— Shazhou</p>
<p>After we stayed overnight in Dongping, which resembled a basin, we arrived at Xijin after breakfast the next day. We had been running in the mountains all day, and I heard that even the character "mountain" was causing headaches. But the guide said that to go to Dongyou, we would have to climb over a Niutou Ridge, so we immediately decided to take the waterway. The waterway was a section of the Dongxi.</p>
<p>The small, pointed-tail grasshopper boat had no rudder or oars. The shallow water flow was just a little deeper than the boat's hull. The riverbed was entirely made of sedimentary rock. The tip of the pole touched the rocks, producing a crisp sound. The speed of the grasshopper boat could also be heard in this sharp sound. When sailing on the shallows, the sound of the water flowed in a continuous rush. The boatmen took off their shoes and went into the water, helping to pull the boat along. The sugarcane-crushing watermills were wailing mournfully, but the mountains and fields were so beautiful. The leaves on the plains were still so lush. The climate of the southern country is like spring in all seasons.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at Shuikou, we still climbed over several mountains, but I had already reached the bank of the Min River.</p>
<p>Before reaching the bank of the Min River, I had imagined the Min River to be vast, but when the Min River was in sight, I felt that reality differed from imagination.</p>
<p>The high mountains on both sides had already defined the course of the Min River. The water trickling from the mountain streams had become so deep and green here. Rushing from upstream to this place, it then rushed away from this place. I don't know why the water flow had to be so hurried, but isn't this a very ready explanation of life? So, I developed a sense of fragility toward the Min River. The Min River is melancholy!</p>
<p>The civilian boats equipped with steamship equipment were full of people from the ×× Command. The boatmen and passengers were arguing over a price, each refusing to yield. After hearing a burst of gunfire, women cautiously emerged with frightened expressions, their bare feet sturdy. The task of fetching water here is done by women. If the saying "the South has many beautiful women" is true, then the beautiful women of the South are beautiful for their health. I wonder what the researchers of human beauty think?</p>
<p>Traveling by boat from Shuikou to Minqing does not take ten hours. The green mountains on both sides are so close and so relaxing. Listening to the sound of the boat oars, the sound of the water flowing under the boat, my heart is at peace, as if I have placed myself in the distant homeland of the water city. But the hateful nightmare-like reality startled me again, shattering my homesickness into fragments.</p>
<p>It seems like a legend, but do the men with bare bodies covered in yellow paper talismans really still exist in the real world? But their ferocious laughter, their evil voices, are all clearly present in my memory! But I do not feel that these believers in evil magic are hateful. Instead, I think they are a bunch of foolish and ignorant people. While China is frantically manufacturing batches of killing weapons in various countries of the world, it still retains this ridiculous magic that prevents bullets from penetrating. But when people use poison gas or death rays to kill you, I wonder if there is any magic that will prevent poisonous gas from penetrating?</p>
<p>Arriving at Minqing, it was just time to light the lamps. Minqing, in the respite of war flames, is silent.</p>

<p>Beiping Led 2-1 in the First Half</p>
<p>Hebei Won the Championship 5-2 Overall</p>
<p>(Tianjin, 14th) The high school men's soccer final was held at 9:00 AM this morning in the first soccer field within the track and field venue. In the first half, the score was 1-2, with Beiping winning. In the second half, Hebei won 4-0. The overall result was 5-2, with Hebei winning the high school men's soccer championship. The competition between the two sides was extremely fierce. Mao Gonghe, the right forward of Hebei, injured his knee joint. After treatment by the health section, he recovered. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Hebei Team</p>
<p>Chen Erde, Wang Hongrong, Liu Baoen, Sun Zhitin, Sun Sijing, Liang Mingzong, Li Guangzi, Sun Fulai, Zhao Qichun, Sun Yongquan, Wang Gonghe</p>
<p>▲Beiping Team</p>
<p>Wang Yumin, Jin Adu, Fu Xinqiu, Xu Feimin, Zhang Guowei, Lin Songfa, Wu Guicheng, Zhong Guanming, Wang Jingxi, Lian Xuanxun, Zhang Zhizhen</p>
<p>▲First Half (Tianjin, 14th) In the high school men's soccer final, Beiping took the offensive at the beginning. The five forwards communicated and pressed towards the Hebei position. Center forward Wang Jingxi dribbled the ball quickly and attacked at a point ten yards in front of the Hebei goal, but the attack was unsuccessful. The ball was rescued by Hebei defender Wang Fenrong, passed to Sun Sijing, who then passed to Sun Fulai. It was snatched by Beiping's Jin Adu, intercepted and sent forward. Lian Yixun rushed forward, dribbled the ball quickly, and attacked again at a point fifteen yards in front of the goal. The ball went over the goal, missing it by a small margin. After competing like this for a long time, Wang Jingxi received assistance from center back Zhang Guowei, broke through directly, and passed the defensive line. Hebei goalkeeper Chen Erde could not save it in time, and Wang kicked in one goal. After this, the coordination of the Beiping team improved, and the ball always rose and fell in the Hebei area. Later, Wu Guicheng of the Beiping team was penalized for a corner kick. The landing point was exactly in front of the goal. Chen Erde and the five Beiping forwards rushed forward together, using ten feet to kick. In the chaos, Lian Yixun kicked in one goal. Hebei lost two cities in a row, but did not give up. They counterattacked more forcefully. Soon, Sun Sijing passed a ball to Sun Fulai, who passed the Beiping defensive position and scored with a strong kick at a point seven yards in front of the goal. Holding on until the end, the first half ended with 2-1, with the Beiping team taking the lead.</p>
<p>▲Second Half At the beginning of the second half, Hebei's momentum suddenly increased. The forwards were active and exceptionally fast, and the center back line was also able to cooperate, strictly defending the position. Five minutes after the start, Hebei's Sun Yongquan dribbled the ball along the side to the Beiping area, passed to Po Qichun, who was blocked and passed to Sun Fulai. Sun dribbled the ball to a point five yards in front of the goal and shot diagonally, scoring. After Beiping lost a point, the forwards all retreated to the center line to assist the center backs in defense. Five minutes later, Beiping's Chuan Xinqiu kicked the ball out of bounds and was penalized for a corner kick. Hebei was led by Mao Gonghe. The ball landed in front of the goal, and Zhao Qichun headed it, but it did not go in. Sun Yongquan caught up and won another point with a kick. Hebei had already turned defeat into victory and attacked even more forcefully. Ten minutes later, Sun Fulai got a ball passed from Li Guangxiang and swept it low at a point ten yards in front of the goal, scoring. At this point, Beiping's formation was already chaotic. The three Hebei center backs all went to the Beiping position to operate. In the last three minutes, Sun Fulai took advantage of the emptiness of Beiping's defense, dribbled the ball quickly, and fell twice at a point six yards in front of the goal because he was eager to win. The Beiping defenders still did not catch up. Sun jumped up and kicked, and the ball went into the net again. The second half ended with a score of 4-0. In conclusion, Hebei won the championship with 5-2.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Hebei Won the High School Basketball Championship, the Strength Gap Was Large, Qingdao Was No Match <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin, 14th) In the high school men's basketball final, Hebei played against Qingdao. In the first half, Hebei won 23-8. In the second half, Hebei won 25-7. The overall result was 48-15. The high school men's basketball championship was won by Hebei. Qingdao's formation was scattered, and their coordination was not as skilled, tight, and strict as Hebei's. The forwards' shooting was also inaccurate. In the second half, with the championship in hand, the Hebei team focused on technical performance, passing high and low.

<p>▲Hebei Lost 1-3</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Tianjin, 14th) In the high school men's volleyball final, Beiping played against Hebei. The first set was 18-21, the second set was 21-16, the third set was 21-15, and the fourth set was 21-16. Beiping won the high school men's volleyball championship with 3-1. Hebei's formation was scattered, and the second row was weak and powerless, often being broken through by the opponent. The back row was good at hitting long balls, but many of them went out of bounds. Whenever a high ball passed over the net, Beiping's front row jumped up and spiked, and the ball became a dead ball as soon as it landed, which was extremely fast. The first two rows of Hebei were almost unable to save it. Although they changed players and formations in the middle, they still could not stop Beiping's sharpness and failed.</p>

In the second set, Liang retreated to the baseline to return the shot, but Zhu's returns were mostly self-inflicted. In the third and fourth sets, the number of games won and lost was mutual, but in the end, Liang's backhand return was powerful, and Zhu's returns went out of bounds a lot, so he failed. In the first singles, Hebei's Li Dingyi's personal skills were still good, but he panicked in the face of the battle, and his blocking and serving were mostly self-inflicted, so he was taken advantage of by Beiping's He Yuqing with a straight three sets.</p>

In the third quarter, Hebei won 11-5. In the fourth quarter, the score was tied 4-4. The overall result was 30-25. When Jilin took the stage, their arrogance was very strong.

After that, the scores of both sides increased mutually, and each was not inferior to the other. In the first half, the cooperation of both teams was good, and there was no gap for each other to take advantage of. Only Jilin had an advantage with a penalty of one point. At the beginning of the second half, in the third quarter, Hebei's center forward Liu Baoheng gradually became active. Relying on his height and strength, he grabbed and received deftly, scoring three goals alone, scoring six points in a row and turning to victory. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, with the key to victory or defeat and honor or disgrace, the guards became stricter, and it was difficult for each other to move. Therefore, the game ended with each side having four points.</p>

Then, Chu Minyi spoke on behalf of President Wang. After that, Zhang Boling gave a speech, saying that the conference was held during the Double Ten Festival, and Hebei Province presented three gifts to the country: the first was material construction, namely the conference venue; the second was spiritual construction, namely the spirit of male and female athletes. The first had already been delivered, and before the closing ceremony, he did not dare to hope that the second could be accomplished. Only today, at the closing ceremony, did he feel that this gift had also been delivered. This conference has yielded the best results. He himself has served as the chief referee no less than twenty or thirty times in his life, and there have always been disputes. However, this time there were no problems at all. First, it was due to the dedication of the organizing committee; second, it was due to the earnest service of the staff; and third, it was due to the orderliness of each unit. In the future, he hoped that this spirit would be extended to all matters throughout the country, and then the country's future would be promising. Subsequently, representatives from various parties delivered speeches and presented awards. Because the time was late, only one commemorative flag was awarded to each unit. The prizes will be collected by the leaders of each unit later. Chairman Chiang's silver shield was awarded to the male runner-up in the overall score, and Chairman Lin's silver tripod was awarded to the overall championship.</p>

He participated in this conference by pretending to visit relatives in Beiping. The leaders of Liaoning and Jilin were worried that the Japanese would not allow him to return to Shenyang. At the closing ceremony this afternoon, they spoke to Shi Jinghuan, the Director of the Department of Industry, and Shi agreed to find him a position. On the 15th, he was ordered to report to the department. Li will practice permanently in the motherland and will always be an athlete from Liaoning.</p>
<p>▲ Situ Guang Secretly Takes Photos (Special dispatch from Tianjin, 14th) Situ Guang, the national record holder for the triple jump, did not participate in the competition this time.

<h3 id="e194">Huacesi's Sharpness Was Fully Exposed and Youyou Was Defeated Yesterday <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Lost by a Score of 4 to 2</p>
<p>A Scene from the First Division of the Western League</p>
<p>Although the Youyou football team has been supplemented by new players this year, the uneven strength of the team is an undeniable fact. In yesterday's match against Huacesi, this weakness was even more apparent. As a result, they were defeated by Huacesi by a score of 4 to 2, which is undoubtedly a blow to their hopes in the First Division Championship. The score at halftime was 3 to 1. There were five to six thousand spectators, and the Shenyuan was very lively at the time.</p>
<p>Youyou's Offense Relies Entirely on the Right Wing Because Youyou's defender Jiang Shanqing was out of the game due to a leg injury, Zhang Rong was substituted, but he was not as good. Xu Heng's goalkeeping was acceptable, but under the fierce attack of the opposing forwards, he could only sigh helplessly. The forwards were most troubled by the weakness of the left wing. Last week, Wang Nanzhen was replaced by Xi Qiaosheng, and now Fu Hexuan has replaced Xi Qiaosheng. Their abilities are similar. This is Youyou's biggest shortcoming. Therefore, the forwards' activities all depend on Zhong, Sun, and Luo. Looking back at the opponent, their connection was pure and skillful, and their movements were agile. Their victory was not accidental.</p>
<p>Numerous Dangerous Situations, Three Goals Conceded in a Row Youyou kicked off, but they were immediately forced back. Huacesi's forwards relied on their skillful and sophisticated connection to launch a fierce attack. The ball revolved in Youyou's territory, within five steps, within ten steps, with numerous dangerous situations. After ten minutes, Youyou's goal was broken. Cliff脱飛 rushed in and passed to the center, Mao林 passed to the right, Tao乐威 saw that his position was not good, and passed back to the left. A巧 took the opportunity to rush up and kicked the ball in with a bang, which was clearly visible. Once the record was opened, Huacesi's momentum did not diminish. Within seven minutes, center Mao林 scored two consecutive goals, making it 3 to 0.</p>
<p>Two Goals Saved Were of No Use Although Youyou tried their best to counterattack, Zhong Yongshen suffered from strict surveillance. Sun Jinshun also had three chances to score, but he failed to do so. Only two minutes before the end of the first half, Zhong Yongshen rushed in on the right, and the ball fell in front of the goal. Luo Haiguang jumped up and headed the ball in. The score at halftime was 3 to 1.</p>
<p>After changing sides in the second half, Zhong Yongshen was again active on the right. The ball was passed to the left, and Liang Shutang scored, with the difference being only one goal. Unexpectedly, within ten minutes, A巧 received a pass from Smith and scored again, making it 4 to 2. Youyou's hope of saving the game was slim, and the score remained the same until the end of the game.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Minister Zhang Jiong of the Ministry of Education's Department of Social Affairs' Views on Revising Textbooks for People's Schools <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Jiong, Director of the Department of Social Education of the Ministry of Education, expressed his views on the revision of textbooks for people's schools on the 13th, saying: In the past, textbooks for people's schools in our country generally focused on literacy, while other common sense, civics, and the Three Principles of the People were all subsidiary. Therefore, textbooks for people's schools were often called "Thousand Character Lessons," such as "The Three Principles of the People Thousand Character Lesson," "Farmers' Thousand Character Lesson," "Citizens' Thousand Character Lesson," and "Commoners' Thousand Character Lesson." Even if the term "Thousand Character Lesson" was not explicitly stated, the content also included one thousand characters, such as "Literacy Textbook," "People's Reader," "Women's Reader," and "People's Literacy Textbook." This is because, in the past, those who were enthusiastic about social education and experts in social education believed that the ignorance of the people was due to illiteracy or limited literacy. If the people could recognize about one thousand commonly used characters, they would be able to read newspapers, read books, write practical texts, and absorb all the new knowledge of the current era. It's like a craftsman who has tools such as axes, chisels, knives, and saws, so he can make tables and chairs, build houses, and make other utensils. However, editing textbooks for people's schools with a focus on the number of characters has the following three difficulties:</p>
<p>(1) Sentences cannot be neat;</p>
<p>(2) Words cannot be short and concise;</p>
<p>(3) Meaning cannot be selective.</p>
<p>Now, I will explain Jiong's views on the revision of textbooks for people's schools below:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding words: This time, when editing textbooks, the number of words does not need to be excessive. Eight or nine hundred words are fine, and six or seven hundred words are also acceptable. Efforts should be made to avoid words with complicated strokes and uncommon words. If one character is taught and can be recognized, and the character can be remembered permanently, then it is much more beneficial than forcibly injecting characters that are quickly forgotten afterward.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding sentences: This time, when editing textbooks, the number of words in each lesson and each sentence does not need to be limited. Three or four words in a sentence are fine, and six or seven words in a sentence are also acceptable. However, from beginning to end, easy-to-understand rhymes or idioms should be used so that readers do not feel difficulty, easily develop interest, and have a deeper impression. Even after a long period of time, they can still remember.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding meaning: This time, when editing textbooks, the number of words does not need to be excessive, but the meaning must be rich. Important knowledge about being a person and being a citizen should be included in the textbooks as much as possible, so that after reading this textbook, the people will not only make progress in personal morality, but also know what kind of country China is, what the relationship between the individual and society is, what the relationship between the individual and the country is, and what the serious situation of national crisis is. In this way, they can fulfill their responsibilities as citizens to the country and be motivated to save the country in the face of national crisis. This seems to be beneficial to both the individual and the country.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding volume: This time, when editing textbooks, the most important principles of being a person and being a citizen should be selected, about eighty in total, and compiled into eighty lessons as basic textbooks for use in primary people's schools. In addition, due to differences in region, occupation, customs, and habits, local educational administrative agencies or social education agencies should compile supplementary and application textbooks to complement the textbooks compiled by the Ministry. (Supplementary textbooks do not need to be edited in rhyme in order to be practical.) In this way, the people can absorb as much important knowledge as possible without any other deficiencies or inconsistencies.</p>

<h3 id="e205">The Importance of Pulmonary Tuberculosis Among Shanghai Students (Part 2) <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Li Ting’an</p>
<p>II. From the Students’ Perspective: The second harmful aspect of pulmonary tuberculosis is that patients can transmit it to other students, causing them to suffer in the same way.</p>
<p>III. Economic Aspect: This is the third harmful aspect: the nation spends a lot of money to educate students, only for them to die. This is a significant loss. According to educational statistics, it costs about 30,000 yuan to successfully cultivate a university student. If one dies, there is an economic loss of 30,000 yuan!</p>
<p>Therefore, the problem of pulmonary tuberculosis is very serious. Our statistics are not fabricated, but based on examination results. Regarding the issue of pulmonary tuberculosis among students, you should pay attention to the following:</p>
<p>Remedial Measures</p>
<p>Remedial measures for pulmonary tuberculosis are difficult. To break it down, the first key point is:</p>
<p>I. Improving Living Conditions Such as Clothing, Food, and Housing: Improving living conditions such as clothing, food, and housing is quite difficult to do. This is because it is an economic issue. We do not contract pulmonary tuberculosis because our bodies are healthy and have great resistance. The source of resistance comes from appropriate clothing, food, and housing. Clothing only needs to protect body temperature and does not need to be made of fine silk. So that is not a problem. The most important thing is food. Food is like burning coal. If the coal is poor, the furnace will not be very good. There is no time now to talk to you about what to eat. As for housing, fresh air and ample sunshine are essential. All this requires the country's politics to be on track and the economy to have a solution before it can be resolved. Japan has already done it. Our country cannot talk about this under the current situation, even if there is it will only be a small part!</p>
<p>II. Investigation and Testing: In addition to improving living conditions such as clothing, food, and housing, investigation and "tuberculin" testing should be done. Each school should have doctors test for positive reactions and take X-rays. We hope that there is no disease, but if there is, we should quickly find a way to treat it.</p>
<p>III. Treating Patients: In principle, patients can be divided into four levels: most severe, severe, mild, and least severe. Those with the most severe cases should stop attending school immediately to avoid infecting others and harming themselves. Those with mild cases can study, but for a shorter amount of time. Parents should add nutritious foods and have them sleep in fresh air at night. Now, the Health Bureau and the Education Bureau, and other agencies have jointly organized a summer camp, recruiting children and providing nutritious food and appropriate exercise. Daily life is as follows: get up at 7:00 AM, breakfast at 7:30 AM, study at 8:00 AM, milk at 10:30 AM, lunch at 12:00 PM, two hours of sleep after lunch, then playtime, bath at 5:00 PM, and sleep at 8:00 PM. Each six-week session costs twelve yuan, and the Health Bureau subsidizes ten yuan, totaling twenty-two yuan, all of which is used for children's nutrition. I believe that these children's weight will definitely increase, and those with the mildest form of pulmonary tuberculosis can be cured by doing this.</p>
<p>IV. Popularizing Health Education: The human body is like a machine. To drive a car well, we must know the structure of the various parts of the car and take care to protect it. In other words, to keep students healthy, we must also make students understand the condition of their bodies, so health education is the most important. It should be listed as a required subject in the school curriculum. The countries around the world have not been able to pay attention to this. We know that the school’s not paying attention to health education and not teaching the car mechanics the content and driving methods are the same disadvantages. So, understanding the organs of the body, understanding health care methods, and instilling the importance of epidemic prevention are the fourth remedial measures.</p>
<p>Finally, to sum up: First, pulmonary tuberculosis is very common in our country. Second, regarding the students, if you study the statistics just reported, the numbers must be very high! Third, prevention methods are to improve the living environment, investigate and test, treat patients, and popularize health education. These are my opinions on remedial measures. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e206">Old Medical Explanations of Five Lin and White Turbidity <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) Dr. Xie Yunshou’s recent book, "The Truth About Gonorrhea," details the dangers of gonorrhea, its symptoms, progression, and treatment methods. The content is rich. It is now on sale. The price is 40 cents. It is sold at Dr. Xie's Clinic at 19 Pinghe Lane, Avenue Edward VII, and at the Author's Bookstore and the Datong Bookstore on the Fourth Road. We are excerpting a section of it here as an introduction.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, the people have been shrouded in the power of old medicine. The old doctors' talk of "deficiency," "strain," and "heat" has truly entered their ears, penetrated their minds, and never been doubted. But from the scientific perspective of today, the truth about various diseases has gradually become clear. Such mysterious disease names really have no place to exist. Now I want to explain the "Five Lin and White Turbidity" as described by old doctors.</p>
<p>Old doctors divide gonorrhea into five types: labor lin, heat lin, qi lin, blood lin, and stone lin. They consider labor lin and qi lin to be due to deficiency, heat lin to be due to heat, blood lin to have both heat and deficiency, and stone lin to be caused by heat or deficiency. Over time, it becomes sand and stone. The symptoms of labor lin are caused by labor injury and deficiency, resulting in inability to urinate, sharp pain in the lower abdomen, and white juice coming out in drops. Qi lin causes the lower abdomen to be full and distended, making it difficult to urinate, often with drops after urination. Heat lin causes urination to be hot and red, short and astringent, with sharp pain below the navel. Blood lin causes blood drops or blood streaks in the urine. Stone lin is also called sand lin, causing the lower abdomen to be sharply distended and the penis to be painful as if cut by a knife, with extreme suffering, and the urine to be like sand and stone.</p>
<p>The above are the old doctors' descriptions of the pathology and symptoms of the Five Lin. From the perspective of our new medicine, the scope of the Five Lin they describe is too broad. Any disease with secretions or solids coming out of the urethra can be called lin. Originally, the word lin means dripping. Dripping is a symptom of a disease, not the name of a disease. The naming of a disease should be distinguished by the anatomical position and the type of pathogen. So what the old doctors thought was a very clear division of the Five Lin, from the perspective of new medicine, is still vague and unclear. Speculating on its symptoms, it actually includes various diseases of the genitourinary system. The names of labor, qi, heat, etc., are incorrect. How many new medical diseases are contained in the old medical disease names of the Five Lin? It is naturally difficult to list them one by one in a precise manner. Now I will bring up the most similar new medical diseases for discussion.</p>
<p>The first type is gonorrhea. The cause of gonorrhea is the infection of a pathogen called gonococcus. Its main symptoms are stinging pain during urination, frequent urination, and white or yellow secretions flowing from the urethra. This is during the acute phase, which resembles what the old doctors call heat lin. If the disease is severe and the symptoms are intense, and the urethral mucosa is broken, blood may even flow out along with it. At that time, old doctors would call it blood lin. But gonorrhea is still gonorrhea. It is just that there are differences in the degree of gonorrhea. People who have gonorrhea, if it becomes chronic, usually have very few secretions, or even don't feel it. When they encounter labor, the secretions increase. At that time, old doctors would call it labor lin. In fact, the disease is still gonorrhea, but it is caused by labor. If you don't have the seeds of gonorrhea in your body, gonorrhea will never occur. So the disease name of labor lin is not valid. If the gonococcus spreads to the bladder, you will feel fullness in the lower abdomen and difficulty urinating, similar to what the old doctors call qi lin. In fact, where does qi come from? It is really a kind of gonococcal cystitis. To be clear, his bladder mucosa does have lesions.</p>
<p>The second type belongs to diseases of the bladder. When the bladder is infected by various bacteria (tubercle bacillus, gonococcus, etc.) or due to trauma, colds, poisoning, or acute infectious diseases, inflammation occurs in the bladder, or when tumors and ulcers occur in the bladder, the symptoms are frequent urination and pain during urination. Tenderness in the bladder area (lower abdomen) and cloudy urine are similar to old medical qi lin. Sometimes it is often mixed with blood, which becomes the old medical blood lin. If it is chronic cystitis, there are not many symptoms when you are quiet. When you are working or your body is unsound, the symptoms will become severe. Wouldn't you be able to call it labor lin at that time?</p>
<p>The third type belongs to diseases of the kidneys. Some kidney diseases also have symptoms such as frequent urination, hematuria, and cloudy urine.</p>
<p>The fourth type is urinary calculus, which is similar to the old medical stone lin or sand lin. The formation of stones is due to the precipitation of components in the urine, such as uric acid, phosphate, oxalate, etc. His size is very uncertain. Some are as small as sand grains, and some are as large as chicken eggs. His place of occurrence is also in the kidney, and also in the ureter, bladder or urethra. His symptoms vary depending on the size, shape, and position of the stones. For example, in the kidneys or ureters, renal colic occurs, which is severe pain in the waist. Sometimes it affects the bladder, testicles, upper legs, back, and shoulder blades. There are also fever, frequent urination, hematuria, etc. If it is in the bladder or urethra, there is a strange urinary retention, which is that sometimes you can urinate at will, and sometimes you cannot urinate. There are also severe pain when urinating and bleeding during urination.</p>
<p>In addition, there is "chyluria." Blood is mixed in the urine. This is a disease caused by the parasite Brugia malayi in the kidneys, as well as various diseases in the urethra. So the name of Five Lin and White Turbidity is really broad. In the genitourinary system, such as the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra, all trauma, bacterial infections, poisoning, etc., can cause frequent urination, painful urination, secretions, and blood in the urine. Therefore, in scientific medicine, doctors should diagnose his position and cause one by one. Then it can be called seeing a doctor. Otherwise, it is caused by labor, called labor lin. Urine is hot and red, called heat lin. The lower abdomen is full, called qi lin. There is blood, called blood lin. Stones are produced, called stone lin. Wouldn't it be too easy to see a doctor?</p>

<p>(42) Gastric Dilation</p>
<p>(Q) What is called gastric dilation?</p>
<p>(A) It is a disease in which the contents of the stomach are larger and weaker than a normal stomach.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>(Q) How do people get this disease?</p>
<p>(A) Any narrowing of the pylorus due to various reasons, such as ulcerative scars, cancer, pressure from tumors outside the stomach, congenital pyloric hypertrophy, pyloric spasm, etc., can cause gastric dilation.</p>
<p>(Q) Are there other reasons?</p>
<p>(A) There are also various stomach diseases, such as chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer, stomach cancer, generalized pain, overeating, etc.</p>
<p>Diseases that weaken the stomach muscles can also cause gastric dilation.</p>
<p>(Q) How is the appetite of people with gastric dilation?</p>
<p>(A) The appetite of the patients is mostly poor, with thirst, heavy fullness after meals, acid reflux, heartburn, belching, and pain in the stomach.</p>
<p>(Q) Do people with gastric dilation often vomit?</p>
<p>(A) Yes. There are often symptoms of vomiting.</p>
<p>(Q) How is the shape of the vomit?</p>
<p>(A) The vomit contains a large amount of old food residue, the acidity is very strong (but gastric dilation caused by stomach cancer lacks hydrochloric acid), and it smells sour and rotten. If placed in a quiet place for a while, it can be divided into three layers.</p>
<p>(Q) What symptoms are revealed on the outside of the abdomen?</p>
<p>(A) If the abdominal wall is thin and loose, the spherical bulge of the stomach can be seen. The lower boundary of the stomach is below the navel. The peristaltic movement of the stomach can also be seen.</p>
<p>(Q) What does it feel like when palpated with your hands?</p>
<p>(A) There is a kind of resistance like touching an air pillow.</p>
<p>(Q) What happens when the stomach is shaken?</p>
<p>(A) There is a splashing sound, which is more obvious when the stomach is empty.</p>
<p>(Q) When the degree of gastric dilation is high, how is the patient's whole body affected?</p>
<p>(A) With a high degree of dilation, the gastric contents can still leave residue overnight, and the patient's nutrition is greatly hindered. As a result, the whole body becomes thin, weak, dizzy, lacks water in the tissues, the tongue is dry, the blood is thick, and the urine output is reduced.</p>
<p>(Q) What should be the treatment plan for gastric dilation?</p>
<p>(A) Attention should be paid to dietary care. For food, you should eat more times each day, and each time the portion should be small rather than large. Night eating is strictly prohibited. Beverages should be restricted, and carbonated drinks should not be drunk.</p>
<p>(Q) Should you rest after eating?</p>
<p>(A) You should rest for an hour after eating. Exercise is fine for mild dilation. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>(II) Diet</p>
<p>Diet is absolutely indispensable for human life. A person's ability to live must come from nutrients. Diet is like gasoline for a car. If the car runs out of gasoline, it cannot move. If a person does not take in enough nutrients for several days or more, the body will naturally become weaker. A sick person, especially a feverish person, consumes a lot of nutrients and body cells within a day. If there are not enough nutrients to repair, then the worsening of the disease is certainly not unexpected. What is said here about diet is not that anyone knows how to provide the patient with an appropriate diet. We must understand the principles of food chemistry, physiological chemistry, and medical knowledge to know that the diet provided to the patient is good for his disease and his body. A brief description of the basic science of the patient's diet is given below for the reader's research:</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the advancement of chemistry and physiological chemistry, we know what the raw materials of food are, what changes occur when they enter the stomach, and what functions nutrients have after being absorbed into the blood. According to the chemical classification method, everything we eat is divided into the following four types: The first type is protein, the function of which in the body is to grow and repair muscles and organs. A part of it is converted into carbohydrates when the body needs it, to generate heat and energy. Foods that are particularly rich in protein are meats, eggs, soybeans (tofu), walnuts, peanuts, milk, etc. Rice and wheat also contain a small amount of protein. A person weighing 150 pounds needs 70 grams (about two taels) of protein per day. Each gram of protein can be converted into four calories of heat. The second type is carbohydrates (starches and sugars), the function of which in the body is to generate heat and energy (note that generating heat is not "fever." Humans are not cold-blooded animals; their bodies must constantly generate heat.) It was explained in the previous article that the body temperature of a healthy person is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Someone asked, what is the body temperature of a healthy person in the Arctic Ocean? What is the body temperature of a person in the tropics? The answer is both 98.6 degrees. Why? The human body is a wonderful chemical machine that can generate heat and energy itself, and when healthy, it can also control the body to have a certain temperature. A locomotive in a train has coal in its furnace, and water is added to the boiler to generate heat and energy. The coal in the human body is carbohydrates, which come from rice, flour, sugar, vegetables, and fruits. Each gram of carbohydrate can generate four calories of heat. This is the most important category of food. The third type is oils (or fats). The function of oily foods in the body is to generate heat or store energy or protect the body. Meat and vegetable oils, walnuts, peanuts, and rapeseed also contain a lot of oil. Each gram of oil can generate nine calories of heat. The fourth type is water. Water is the medium for various vital elements in the body. If the body lacks carbohydrates due to not eating food, the body will first use the stored glycogen (the sugar stored in the body) to generate heat and energy, just like a person who has no income first uses up his savings. After the glycogen is used up, the body gradually converts fat into carbohydrates and uses it for generating heat and energy. The third step is to convert a part of the muscles and organs (protein) in the body into carbohydrates for the same purpose. In short, if the nutrients in the diet of a feverish patient are insufficient, he must convert his own muscle cells into materials for generating heat and energy. This is the reason why the body loses weight due to improper diet. Conversely, if the patient can get rich and suitable nutrients, the body will certainly not lose weight.</p>

<p>(19) Explanation of Brain Leakage</p>
<p>When people suffer from nasal congestion, thick purulent secretions flow from the nose, and the sense of smell is reduced, they call it brain leakage. In fact, how can the brain leak? If it is true, then unless the head is injured, so that the skull is broken, the brain can leak out. At this time, the life of the sufferer will also have problems. As for the fact that the brain leaks out from the nasal cavity, I have not seen it, and I have not even heard of it. The reason why it is commonly called brain leakage is probably because the secretions from the nasal cavity flow out from the deep part of the nasal cavity, as if they flow out from the brain. So the words "brain leakage" are used to describe this condition. It cannot be considered a disease name. From the perspective of medical anatomy, the nose and brain are completely separated by bone walls. These bone walls are all the bone walls that make up the paranasal sinuses. Therefore, if the paranasal sinuses become inflamed, the mucous membrane inside these bone walls can immediately swell and turn red. Initially, it secretes mucus. Later, it secretes pus. However, his illness is different. Because the paranasal sinuses (originally called Sinus Paranasalis) can be divided into four cavities. They are (1) the maxillary sinus Sinus Maxillaris (2) the frontal sinus Sinus Frontalis, (3) the ethmoid cells CellulaeEthmoidales, and (4) the sphenoid sinus Sinus Sphenoidalis. The anatomical relationship of these four paranasal sinuses has its own special situation. Therefore, the patient's subjective symptoms and clinical observations are also different. I will briefly talk about it separately now. Perhaps the explanation of brain leakage may be more clear.</p>
<h3 id="e210">(I) Acute Maxillary Sinusitis <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Sinuitis Maxillaris Acuta</p>
<p>There are many causes of acute maxillary sinusitis. It can be divided into: 1. It is most often secondary to acute nasal catarrh and influenza. 2. It is secondary to scarlet fever, measles, and pneumonia. 3. Surgery in the nasal cavity, foreign bodies in the nasal cavity, injuries to the maxillary bone, syphilis and tumors of the sinus wall, etc., can also cause the occurrence of this disease. 4. Often caries can also cause this disease. That is, among the second premolar, the first molar, the second molar, and the third molar. If there is caries, his alveolar process (the part where the teeth take root) can often develop osteomyelitis or osteitis. Eventually causing sinusitis.</p>
<p>In the early stage of this disease. There are often symptoms such as fever, chills, systemic fatigue, and loss of appetite. As for the pain of suffering from this disease. It is in the maxillary bone area. There is often a feeling of tension. Or complain of pain. The pain often affects the frontal area. And it can increase his strength due to coughing, sneezing, or tilting the head forward. There are also toothache, nasal congestion, excessive nasal discharge, and reduced sense of smell. It is also a common symptom. At this time, the patient's cheek. Most are swollen and red. And there is tenderness. If you use a nasal speculum to examine the nasal cavity. You can see the mucous membranes of the inferior turbinate and middle turbinate. Both are very red and swollen. In the middle nasal passage and the inner surface of the inferior turbinate. There is pus or pus line. Pus is usually mucopurulent. Sometimes mixed with blood. The bacteria contained in this pus. Probably suppurative streptococcus and pneumococcus are the most common. As for suppurative staphylococcus, diphtheria bacillus, influenza bacillus, etc. That is relatively rare.</p>
<p>If this disease is treated properly. It can be completely cured in one or two weeks. Otherwise, it will turn to chronic maxillary sinusitis. That is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Speaking of the treatment of this disease. Initially, diaphoretic medicine and warm compress method should be used. Or illuminate with a Sarox lamp. Or use an electric light head bath. Both can make the secretions easier to absorb. On the one hand, efforts should be made to make the swelling of the nasal mucosa. Quickly subside. Because the secretions in the sinus. Can therefore be easily discharged. If the pus discharge is obstructed. Then a catheter must be used. Probe into the sinus. Wash out the pus. If it is acute maxillary sinusitis caused by caries. Of course, a dentist should be consulted at the same time. This is the right thing to do. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Chapter VIII Clinical Examination Methods</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will say; although the various aspects of clinical examination methods are important; but this is a matter for the doctor himself, and the patient does not need to know so clearly. That's a good point. But we must know that the general medical knowledge of Chinese patients is extremely lacking. When they are sick, although they cannot do without new medicine, what they "prostrate themselves" to is only the amazing treatment results. They are completely ignorant of whether the recognition of the disease is truly accurate. Therefore, many doctors, although their attitude is very humble, and they are definitely not easy to make a diagnosis, but as a result, they are mostly incompatible with the patient; even for the various precise and detailed examination work, they think it is very trivial and annoying, and does not help the patient at all. This kind of misconception exists in the minds of the general patients, almost nine out of ten. They do not know the true meaning of science, which is to question and eliminate arbitrary judgments. New medicine is a product of science, and of course it is no exception. In order to eliminate this misunderstanding, I feel that there should also be a clear understanding in the minds of the general public about the necessary reasons for the various examination work in the clinic.</p>
<p>The importance of clinical examination methods has been described above; the scope he includes is also very broad. According to his nature, it can be divided into the following six types; (1) past medical history, (2) physical examination, (3) sputum examination, (4) blood examination, (5) specialized diagnosis, (6) X-ray diagnosis. For the convenience of readers, I will now describe the general situation of each type one by one below.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Five Years of Sino-French University Pharmacy <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Jinru</p>
<p>(1) Origin of Establishment: Pharmacy is one of the most practical and essential specialized sciences of modern times. It is impossible not to study it. Anyone with basic scientific knowledge would not deny this. Unfortunately, Chinese people are bound by thousands of years of outdated thinking, excluding medicine and pharmacy from the traditional occupations of scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants. Especially for pharmacy, it is seen as insignificant. Although medicine has progressed over the years, with schools established and talents cultivated, and famous doctors emerging, pharmacy has received little attention. There are very few pharmacists. To seek new and advanced pharmacy knowledge, one must study abroad, with no other way to learn. So-called traditional Chinese medicine still adheres to ancient methods of decoction and preparation, without utilizing scientific extraction or imitating new drugs. This allows imported drugs to be sold in large quantities without resistance. Moreover, with the increase of modern medicine, the quantity of imported drugs also increases, resulting in a loss of tens of millions of dollars each year, which is lamentable. Looking at other countries, pharmacists and chemists are competing to collect Chinese medicinal materials and study them tirelessly. For example, ephedrine, which has a diaphoretic effect, was discovered in Ephedra, and eumenol, which has a menstrual regulating effect, was discovered in Chinese angelica. These are significant achievements of their research. Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs thousands of years before the Western calendar, becoming the ancestor of drug research, far earlier than the invention of Western medicine. China is rich in natural and high-quality medicinal materials. If Chinese people can continue the inventions of their predecessors, add further research, and establish factories to produce their own drugs, selling the products overseas, wouldn't it benefit the world, bring blessings to mankind, and shine in the world's international medical and pharmaceutical community? It would also be a way for the country to increase revenue and wealth. Therefore, Dr. Chu Minyi, a medical doctor and pharmacist, and Dr. Song Wusheng, a medical doctor and doctor of science, were willing to sacrifice some of their time and energy to discuss with leading figures in education, Li Shizeng and Cai Yuanpei, as well as the Shanghai New Drug Trade Association, to jointly establish a pharmacy college. The aim was to cultivate Chinese pharmaceutical talents in preparation for establishing factories to produce new drugs, to stop the outflow of funds and benefit the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>(2) Establishment Process: In the spring of 1929, leading figures in education, Li Shizeng, Chu Minyi, and Song Wusheng, planned to establish a pharmacy college in Shanghai. They discussed it with pharmaceutical industry leaders Huang Chujiu, Yuan Hesong, Tu Kaizheng, and Pan Ruitang, who all expressed deep sympathy and promised to provide strong support. Later, they met Cai Yuanpei, who also strongly supported the idea. Li Shizeng then obtained the consent of the board of directors of the Sino-French University in Beiping, which agreed to provide a monthly subsidy of 2,500 yuan as regular expenses. The Shanghai New Drug Trade Association contributed 10,000 yuan, and the Sino-French Education Fund Committee allocated 50,000 yuan, totaling 60,000 yuan as start-up funds. Li Shizeng, Cai Yuanpei, Chu Minyi, Song Wusheng, Tu Kaizheng, Yuan Hesong, Zhou Bangjun, Huang Yusheng, and Zhang Xianda were jointly elected to form a board of directors to prepare for the establishment. It was named the Private Sino-French University Pharmacy College. Chu Minyi was appointed as the president, and Song Wusheng as the dean of academic affairs. In the autumn of 1929, a school site was found, and regulations were formulated and submitted to the Ministry of Education for record. The Ministry of Education considered the term "college" for pharmacy to be inconsistent with the university organization law, and ordered it to be renamed the Private Sino-French University Pharmacy Special Training Department. Until the summer of 1932, the Ministry ordered the cancellation of the board of directors, making it completely subordinate to the Private Sino-French University in Beiping. The president was renamed director to comply with university regulations. The board of directors of the Sino-French University then submitted an application to the Ministry of Education for registration and increased the regular expenses to 4,000 yuan per month. In November of the same year, the Ministry sent personnel to inspect the department. They found that the main courses focused on practical application, and both teachers and students worked diligently. However, the equipment of the library and laboratory was limited by economic constraints and could not be fully developed. Based on the report, the Ministry of Education approved the temporary registration, requiring improvements to the library and laboratory equipment within one year. In the spring of 1934, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to inspect again. They had a very good impression and issued an order to formally approve the establishment.</p>

<h3 id="e213">After Reading "Dissent on Creation and Time" <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Huaibai</p>
<p>On the 19th of last month, Mr. Zhishui published an article on this journal, expressing dissent on my work "Creation and Time." In this dissent, there are many opinions that contradict mine, which I am very grateful for. Originally, the truth of a matter is that the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom. There is no need to force agreement. However, the more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes. I feel that in Mr. Zhishui's dissent, there are some places that are close to far-fetched and presumptuous, so I have to say a few more words:</p>
<p>Mr. Zhishui began by mentioning the three Greek tragedians: Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. He generally said, "The three of them each wrote eighty or ninety or even more than a hundred works. They cannot but be said to be 'prolific,' yet they were not therefore not 'great'." But what we need to know is that the statement that these three tragedians each wrote eighty or ninety works is just a legend. In fact, the extant works of Aeschylus and Sophocles are only seven each, and the extant works of Euripides are only eighteen. Mr. Zhishui himself felt that citing these three Greek tragedians as evidence of "prolificness" was not very reliable, so he said: "But Greece is too ancient after all, and Greek 'history' is somewhat 'mythical' and cannot be considered good evidence." He believed that reliable evidence was to cite people like Scott, Dumas, Balzac, Tolstoy, and Zola to prove that "prolificness" is not harmful to "greatness." However, what we cannot ignore here is that Scott and others were able to win the dual titles of "prolific" and "great" writers, was their writing attitude "too casual"? Did they "botch" their works? Did they obtain their dual titles through "long-term effort and hard work?" Let's look at Scott first. He was burdened with huge debts, so he had to overwork to repay them. His hard work was incessant day and night throughout his life. In the year before his death, he was still working hard on his *Fair Maid of Perth*. Balzac suffered from the same disease as Scott, and was constantly harassed by creditors. He got up in the middle of the night every day and started writing, and during the day he had to go to the printing press to proofread. He was a most hardworking "mental laborer." Zola's Rougon-Macquart series also took more than twenty years of effort to write. Based on these facts, I dare say that the honors that Scott and others have won in the literary world have all been obtained through long-term effort and hard work. When they wrote each work, their attitude was extremely cautious, and they were not "hasty works" written at random. However, for a writer to want to have both "prolificness" and "greatness" is not an easy thing after all. Therefore, there are still people who criticize Scott's works for not having very real inner emotions and thoughts, and Zola also committed the fault of being verbose and cumbersome in his descriptive techniques. These great writers still inevitably have minor flaws due to their "prolificness," and the same can be said of others. So we can say this: to be both "prolific" and "great" is the best, followed by "better to have nothing than something shoddy," and the worst is to be a writer who "strives for quantity without seeking quality."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhishui said: "When we read Goethe's biography, we know that he did not spend 'fifty years' exclusively on 'Faust'." This is natural. Goethe, like us, was a mortal who needed to make a living. Those "fifty years" occupied most of his life, and he, like us, needed to live. When he wrote "Faust," he was still living on the same earth as us, and he could not completely escape the entanglements of human affairs on this earth. At least eating, sleeping, reading, and talking must have taken up part of his time. What I said about him spending fifty years writing Faust can only be said to be "roughly" so. It is not that he absolutely never stopped writing during those fifty years. Mr. Zhishui seems to have taken those "fifty years" a bit too rigidly.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhishui finally said that I "put aside the writer's life experience, etc., and only made judgments based on the rigid relationship between 'creation and time,' which is difficult for contemporary writers to accept." He also said that based on "the examples I cited and the criticisms of contemporary writers, it cannot be said that his views are limited to rigid time relationships." These words are Mr. Zhishui's personal presumptions. In my article "Creation and Time," when did I say that "creation" only needs "sufficient time" and can abandon other conditions? Of course, there are many conditions required for creation. Are they only "life experience," "observation," and "thought," as Mr. Zhishui said? There are also "imagination," "emotion," and "descriptive skills," which can be known by "common sense." However, my point is that "sufficient time" is also one of the important conditions for creation. Because the title of my article is "Creation and Time," I only stated the importance of "time" to "creation." There was naturally no need to mention anything about life experience, etc., which went beyond the topic. Because I did not mention it, Mr. Zhishui said that my views were limited to time relationships and that I put aside all other aspects. Isn't this presumptuous?</p>
<p>"Presumption" can obliterate other people's opinions. In debate or criticism, relying solely on "presumption" is certainly a very convenient method. However, this is too dangerous. Therefore, good critics dare not try this weapon, "presumption," lightly.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Scientific Explanation of Arhats Born from Clamshells <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongli</p>
<p>Let us temporarily put aside biology and science, and just understand that Buddhists like to release animals, and we can get the explanation of Arhats born from clamshells from Mr. Chen Zizhan.</p>
<p>For three days, newspapers competed to publish this piece of news: "A turtle floated to the shore of Wusong, as big as a round table, with the Tianqi reign year and the words 'Peng Mou Released' engraved on its carapace."</p>
<p>Arhats born from clamshells are just the same thing. Buddhists are afraid of sin if they eat clams, and they feel it is not worthwhile to release them for nothing. So, they seek fun by casting small lead arhats and gluing them with tin to the inside of the clamshells, and then putting them back into the water. The clams continue to live in the water, and over time, the clamshells grow thicker, and the lead arhats are also coated with a layer of clamshell material. If there are no flaws, at first glance, it would be considered to be naturally formed.</p>
<p>The Aurora University Museum on Rue Luban has two such clamshells, each with more than ten arhats. Mr. Chen has already said that Arhats born from clamshells have been seen in ancient times, and now they are seen again. That's all there is to it, so what's so strange about it? (Unpaid)</p>
<h3 id="e215">In Sickness <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Zhide</p>
<p>In sickness, even the smallest things can trigger unprovoked anger.</p>
<p>Yesterday, because I couldn't resist my wife's persistent persuasion, I reluctantly took the dose of laxative (I was already a little unhappy). By evening, I had a strong urge to relieve myself, and it got worse and worse. Although I was very thirsty, I couldn't even get a chance to swallow a sip of water. Fortunately, I managed to get through the first half of the night before it gradually stopped. My heart was already filled with resentment. But when I lay in bed, I was too tired to care about anything.</p>
<p>Today, I woke up at exactly ten thirty. My mind was much clearer. My mouth was terribly dry, and my stomach felt hungry. However, when I saw my wife standing by the bed, staring at me blankly, the resentment that filled my heart last night involuntarily surged up. But when she saw that I was awake, she quickly handed me a cup of tea and asked gently, "Are you feeling better now? Have a sip of water to moisten your throat."</p>
<p>That made it difficult for me to explode. I had to drink the tea and think of ways to make things difficult for her: "Um, is there anything to eat?"</p>
<p>Because I clearly knew that there wasn't a single penny in the house right now. Moreover, she had told me at breakfast yesterday that that meal had used up all the remaining noodles, and the rice jar had been swept clean three days ago.</p>
<p>Sure enough, when she heard my question, she immediately showed hesitation and embarrassment. So I took advantage of the situation and urged her even more urgently: "Hurry up! What are you standing there for? Don't you know you have to eat something after having diarrhea all night?" As I spoke, I fixed my eyes on her, watching how she would solve this problem. At this moment, I had long forgotten the responsibilities and obligations that a husband should fulfill towards his wife.</p>
<p>However, it was too far beyond my expectations. As soon as I stopped speaking, I really didn't expect that she didn't even have the hesitant expression just now. Instead, she smiled even more gently and responded with a "yes" and turned to leave the house. Afterwards, I clearly heard the sound of her opening and closing the front door, which naturally made me suspicious. I predicted that she would either go to get credit for me or borrow money for me - how could she sincerely live with me! So in my heart, the flames of anger grew even more, like a volcano waiting to explode.</p>
<p>When I heard the door ring again, my wife came back with two pink paper bags, smiling happily. I couldn't help but give her a sentence right away: "What did you go to do just now?"</p>
<p>Obviously, she was startled by my loud voice. Only then did she notice the unhappy look on my face. But she completely misunderstood: "Did I make you wait too long? I went out to buy you some snacks." She put the paper bags on my bedside, still smiling, and said, "Eat them. The bag on top is chicken cake, and the one below is nanba crisps. I know you like to eat these, so I got them on credit at Second Uncle's shop."</p>
<p>"On credit again!" I interrupted her even more sharply. Then she became so timid: "Could it be otherwise? There's nothing in the house..."</p>
<p>At this moment, the volcano that had long been waiting to explode in me began to erupt.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, I can go without eating if there's no money at home! ... Such expensive things, even rich people in our village wouldn't necessarily be willing to eat them as meals when they're sick. What about us? ... In order to eat, you can brazenly do it. Of course, you don't feel anything, but that's digging a hole for me, embarrassing me! ... Does it mean that a person can eat whatever they like? I like to eat so many things, I'm just afraid I can't afford it ... The root cause is to blame Second Uncle - blame him for opening a snack shop here! ..."</p>
<p>"Actually, I don't understand, I haven't treated you even half as well as I should ... You're deliberately arguing with me, you don't want me to get well! ..."</p>
<p>Whenever I throw such a tantrum, it is very difficult to restrain myself for a while. At the same time, every time my wife is subjected to such harsh scolding, she doesn't say a word, she just sits beside me and sobs sadly. This time was no exception: my wife just sobbed without saying anything. And I, who was extremely agitated in my sickness, found it even more difficult to stop the fire of anger once it had erupted.</p>
<p>This went on until it was almost time to light the lamps, when the aggravated pain violently attacked me. After a series of unconscious faints, I finally managed to extinguish the unprovoked fire of anger. My wife, with red and swollen eyes, busily took care of me again in a panic.</p>
<h3 id="e216">On the Indian Ocean <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>Hoping for a pleasant sea voyage, it wasn't until this return journey home that the Conte Rosso liner sped across the smooth-as-mirror Indian Ocean. It had the speed to reach Shanghai directly in a week - I mean, from Singapore.</p>
<p>In my memory, it seemed like the Mid-Autumn Festival: if not, why was the moon so bright?</p>
<p>There are few storms at sea in autumn. It had been two days at sea since leaving Singapore: the sea water was getting darker and darker. Standing on the deck and looking at the vast expanse, you could imagine the depth of the water. I loved to sneak to the bow of the ship early in the morning, before people woke up, to watch the sunrise. A blood-red sun burst out of the seabed and rolled into the sky, wouldn't you guess that wasn't a flavorful miracle? I also loved to sit alone on the deck on lonely nights, listening to the clattering of the machinery and watching the silver moon. At that time, I was younger and knew less about the world than I do now. Maybe that was why the Italian sailors liked me so much, and they often came to chat with me when they were free. The one who looked like a fat pig spoke some English, so we spent the most time together. He always praised Mussolini in front of me, saying that this fascist leader was the greatest man in the world.</p>
<p>- Have you read Mussolini's autobiography?</p>
<p>Once, he suddenly asked me about such a book.</p>
<p>- No.</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>- In Italy, every young person has read this book. You know, Mussolini is the greatest man in the world!</p>
<p>But I wasn't very excited. Think about it; would a overseas Chinese student who grew up in a colony have a good political consciousness? Those rulers were really clever, they had ways to make you understand nothing. After being a good student in a church school for several years, reading many books about my Lord Jesus, I finally walked away like a miracle of the sun rising from the bottom of the sea. - Now, I am on the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>People with future aspirations are always happy: moreover, there are no dangerous winds and waves at sea in autumn to make you afraid?</p>
<p>And it was the time when "the moon is especially bright on Mid-Autumn Festival"! That night I sat alone at the bow of the ship with my Ukalele. The waves crashed against the hull, making a harsh sound. Besides that, everything was quiet. There were always foolish people in the world; weren't those sleeping in the stuffy cabins wasting the good night?</p>
<p>Strangely, I couldn't pluck the strings and sing anything. Could it be that I had forgotten all the tunes that I loved to sing under the coconut trees? The moon poured down on the sea, reflecting silver light. The wind had the feeling of autumn, and I felt a little cold wearing only a thin shirt. Knowing that I was getting closer and closer to my ancient homeland, I didn't know why I was so excited that I just wanted to shout out loud - what should I shout? Young people always find it so easy to throw reason into the sea.</p>
<p>How can I forget the sea voyage on the Indian Ocean? Here, I saw the sunrise in the east. I suddenly became brave in front of this magnificent scene! I talked and laughed with the admirer of Mussolini, and ate Italian bread together. Even more so, under the Mid-Autumn moon, I carefully recalled the unforgettable stories of the coconut grove, and also considered the unknowable future. ...</p>

<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>"Ooh wah -- ooh wah --" Dong Sheng the cripple shouted, limping and getting angry! Damn it, I won't take this meal, are you afraid of a single egg! -- Estimating that Shoufu the Cannon relaxed his grip, he suddenly turned around, broke free from his left hand. He stepped back and shouted: "This is not your turn to settle accounts with me. I didn't eat your mother's selling money! If you have the guts, go talk to Mr. Dasheng!"</p>
<p>"What guts or no guts!" Shoufu the Cannon kicked Dong Sheng the cripple with a flying kick. Dong Sheng the cripple, used to holding his "oil-soaked" left hand, gently caught Shoufu the Cannon's left foot. Shoufu the Cannon was not afraid of this catch, he jumped on Dong Sheng the cripple. His foot slipped down from Dong Sheng the cripple's arm and stood on the ground. But Dong Sheng the cripple grabbed Shoufu the Cannon's thigh and refused to let go. Shoufu the Cannon couldn't get away, and his fists rained down on Dong Sheng the cripple's head. Dong Sheng the cripple did a "goat head attack," and Shoufu the Cannon fell forward, his upper body pressing on Dong Sheng the cripple's buttocks. Dong Sheng the cripple's "goat head attack" went straight through Shoufu the Cannon's crotch, knocking his head on the roadside stone. Blood gushed from his face ... In this way, the villagers rushed over and pulled them apart!</p>
<p>"Is this my fault? Is this my fault?" Dong Sheng the cripple said, and couldn't help but sob a little. "I've been a village policeman for two years, and I haven't cheated the villagers in the slightest! I'm always scolded by the villagers, but I always endure it. I'm also beaten by the soldiers and scolded by the district chief, but I always endure it. I look at Mr. Dasheng's face, I look at Awen's face, I suffer day after day, but today, but today, you judge me ...!"</p>
<p>"Unreasonable! This bastard! This bastard!" Mr. Dasheng slammed the table!</p>
<p>"Okay! Everyone doesn't want to do it! Everyone doesn't want to do it! I won't do it tomorrow! I'll go tell the district chief! I won't do it tomorrow! Your business, I'll also tell the district chief, tell the district chief!" Mr. Feng Wen kept shaking his head and swinging his buttocks. He was again like a village head.</p>
<p>"This ... this won't work," Kaiyang the Pockmark stopped him. "If the village head doesn't do it, who else will? Shoufu the Cannon is now eating rations, going home and beating the village police. If you report it, he will be executed. We are all from the same village, don't do that!"</p>

<h3 id="e218">Problems with Consignment Trade in Foreign Markets <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Kong Dian</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>In recent years, China's foreign trade has been impacted by the dumping of foreign goods, leading to a growing trade deficit. From January to August this year alone, in just eight months, imports exceeded exports by a staggering 360 million yuan. If our countrymen do not change their deeply ingrained mentality of subservience and reject unnecessary foreign goods, the total collapse of the national economy may be imminent, and soon it will be staring us in the face. However, in terms of international trade, from a passive perspective, it is the sacred duty of the people to plug loopholes and prevent trade deficits; from an active perspective, it is still essential to develop export businesses and explore overseas markets. Recently, the call to revitalize foreign trade has been widespread, becoming a national consensus. However, today, not only are ordinary merchants largely ignorant of foreign market conditions, but also export trade support institutions such as shipping companies, banks, and marine insurance companies are often lacking and unprepared, making direct trade difficult to achieve. Therefore, this article briefly describes the theory and practice of consignment trade, hoping to provide reference material for those discussing and engaging in the export business.</p>
<p>Consignment trade, also known as consignment sales, is a method in which the owner of goods consigns them to a merchant in another location, on the condition of paying a certain commission, entrusting the merchant to sell them on their behalf. In this arrangement, the person entrusting others to sell goods is called the consignor (Consignor or Shipper), and the person entrusted to sell goods is called the consignee (Consignee). This type of transaction is not only common in foreign trade but also quite prevalent in the domestic market. The reasons for its popularity in international trade are twofold:</p>
<p>(1) To promote various goods in foreign markets, direct transactions with local buyers, without going through any intermediary merchants, should be the principle. However, opening branch offices is not only very costly, but it is also difficult to fully understand the commercial customs and supply and demand conditions of that market in a short period of time. Therefore, it is better to seek out local merchants and enter into a consignment agreement with them, and then change the strategy when the time is right and it is definitely sufficient to deal directly with local buyers.</p>
<p>(2) The distribution locations of special commodities around the world are often fixed. For example, London for wheat and New York for raw silk. Those engaged in these businesses in various countries mostly gather here to gather commercial information. Commission Merchants specializing in acting as agents for others in buying and selling are particularly numerous. Opening branch offices and directly engaging in sales may not be sufficient to compete with others, so it is better to entrust commission merchants to sell on one's behalf, putting oneself in an advantageous position.</p>
<p>For this reason, during the transitional period of international trade, a country engaging in export business, if it feels that it lacks the experience of selling goods in foreign markets, mostly uses the consignment method as a principle. Before the European War, most of the United States' exported goods were consigned to British and German trading companies for sale, which is a notable example.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Consigned goods can be divided into two types according to the different terms of consignment: First, regarding the sale of goods, if the consignor does not specify a definite price and allows the consignee to handle the matter with full authority according to market conditions, this is called Unlimited Consignment (Without Limit). Conversely, if the consignor places various restrictions on the timing, method, and selling price, etc., this is called Limited Consignment (With Limit). There is much discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of the two in ordinary commerce. However, in foreign trade, the two parties are separated by vast oceans, making it difficult to oversee and balance everything. Moreover, market conditions change rapidly, and opportunities are fleeting. If the consignee's commission agent is truly reliable and trustworthy, they will be able to make independent decisions and take immediate action using the most efficient and effective methods. Therefore, unlimited consignment is often adopted. However, it must be noted that if this method is adopted and the consignee is eager to recover the amount of the documentary bill, they may dispose of the goods at will regardless of market conditions, resulting in a selling price that is far beyond the consignor's expectations and incurring losses. This often happens, so it is still appropriate to maintain certain conditions when entering into a contract.</p>
<p>In consignment trade, a Commission Merchant, although selling goods in its own name, does not bear the profits or losses resulting from the sales. Therefore, its relationship with the consignor is legally a type of mandate, and the extent of its authority comes purely from this mandate. Usually, a contract is signed, stipulating on the one hand that the consignee should seek the greatest benefit for the consignor within the possible scope, and after the goods are sold, notify the consignor by letter or telegram, and prepare a statement along with the payment; (however, usually the consignor makes a documentary bill with the bank to obtain the price of the goods when sending the goods,) and on the other hand stipulating that the consignee may first deduct advances and commissions from the price of the goods. Advances are payments made on behalf of the consignor, and commissions are the remuneration that the consignee should receive. If they are not paid, the consignee has the right to retain the goods.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Choosing a Commission Merchant is no different from choosing other firms, and the only goal is to ensure reliability. The most effective method is for the exporter to conduct on-site inspections or send a delegate to investigate. However, the following methods are commonly used:</p>
<p>(1) Magazines and Newspapers: In recent years, advertisements in newspapers and magazines have increased with their circulation. For example, Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao often have records of foreign merchants overseas needing Chinese goods. Magazines such as the Industrial and Commercial Bi-monthly published by the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, because it is responsible for guiding the development of overseas markets, thoroughly investigates and records the store names, commodity names, business locations, etc., of foreign merchants who want to trade with Chinese merchants and purchase Chinese specialties. Other commercial monthly reports issued by chambers of commerce in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Hankou, etc., also often contain such advertisements.</p>
<p>(2) Directories of Businessmen and Industrialists: Also commonly known as telephone directories. The most famous and longest-running directory of businessmen and industrialists in the world is Kelly's Directory of Merchants, Manufacturers and Shippers of the World, published annually in the United Kingdom. It comprehensively lists prominent merchants, import and export businesses, factories, banks, insurance companies, and shipping companies from all over the world, and includes indexes by business type and location for easy reference. Other directories such as Dean's Export Merchant Shippers published in the United Kingdom, Adresboek Van Nederland published in the Netherlands, Annuaris d'Italia' published in Italy, Severiges Idandelrs Kalander published in Sweden, Norges Handels Kalender published in Norway, International Trade Developer published in Japan, Annuaire du Commerce published in Switzerland, Annuaire de Commerce published in Belgium, and Annuaris Commercial published in Portugal are also quite detailed, and many of them contain advertisements. Subscribing to them will surely lead to finding a suitable consignee.</p>
<p>(3) Assistance from Chambers of Commerce: Chambers of commerce, such as general chambers of commerce in various places, are responsible for promoting overseas trade and have some connections with chambers of commerce in various countries. If they are entrusted to seek out goods for which one is exporting, with trading terms and other trade reports, they will certainly be able to provide some assistance.</p>
<p>(4) Entrusting Consulates: Consular officials are responsible for developing commerce. Although many of the consuls stationed overseas in China are mediocre in knowledge and do not know what their duties are, they are also quite enthusiastic in supporting merchants and civilians. Requesting them to investigate the market conditions in the place of residence or reputable firms is not difficult to achieve a reasonable effect.</p>
<p>(5) Entrusting Corresponding Banks: Although only the Bank of China currently has branches overseas among Chinese banks, each bank that operates foreign exchange business has corresponding agencies in major commercial ports around the world. If one entrusts them to introduce them, they will be able to inform them of the credit status and business outlines of traders in that location, and after another contact, the two parties can freely communicate and proceed with transactions.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>From the perspective of practical situations, the forms of consignment of goods to foreign markets for sale in export trade can generally be divided into the following four types:</p>
<p>(1) Manufacturers ship their products directly to the central markets of foreign countries and entrust them to importers there for sale.</p>
<p>(2) Domestic exporters, entrusted by manufacturers, transport their goods to the central markets of foreign countries and entrust them to importers in those markets for sale at the manufacturers' own risk and calculation.</p>
<p>(3) Exporters, in order to expand sales channels, use reputable commission agents in foreign markets and entrust them to sell on their behalf.</p>
<p>(4) Exporters, in order to develop new markets, tentatively entrust importers in those places to sell with the intention of trial sales.</p>
<p>Among these four, the first type, where manufacturers directly entrust foreign merchants to sell, is very common in various countries. However, foreign trade requires special knowledge and skills in terms of export procedures, recovering payment, and communication. It is inevitable that there will be many obstacles if manufacturers take on sales themselves. The second type, where manufacturers entrust exporters who then entrust others to sell, inevitably increases costs because it requires paying double commissions, which is also unfavorable. The third type, using powerful merchants in the export destination to share a portion of the market and occupy a certain position, is most suitable for goods that are abundant in production and have international sales channels. The fourth type is most suitable for developing new markets. China's autonomous foreign trade is just beginning, and in terms of consignment sales, it is most appropriate to adopt this method. The question that arises is: Which market should one start with?</p>
<p>Regarding market research, in various countries, consuls stationed overseas are required to submit detailed reports monthly, which are published by the competent authorities to inform merchants. In China, the consuls are mostly limited in knowledge, and the government does not urge them, so it is impossible to know the details of overseas market conditions. However, the number of Chinese nationals residing overseas, just in Southeast Asia alone, has reached six or seven million. In addition to a portion of these expatriates engaging in manual labor, most of them open shops in their locations and directly engage in transactions with the locals. In the past, Japanese goods accounted for the majority of goods sold. Since the violent occupation of the Northeast by the Japanese, they have been motivated by righteous indignation and have severed relations with the Japanese. Therefore, their need for domestic goods is very strong. Moreover, these markets are only separated from us by a narrow strip of water, and their customs and habits are similar to those of the mainland. To develop overseas trade, Southeast Asia is the most suitable market for us.</p>
<p>Once the market has been selected, the following items can be studied in detail:</p>
<p>A. Regarding the supply side:</p>
<p>A. The producer and manufacturer of the goods, B. The status of production and supply, C. Competing products and competitors, D. Are there substitutes and what are their advantages and disadvantages?</p>
<p>B. Regarding the demand side:</p>
<p>A. Area of demand, B. Uses, C. Season of demand, D. Amount of demand during a certain period.</p>
<p>C. Regarding transactions:</p>
<p>Such as commissions, delivery methods, payment collection methods, units of sale of goods, packaging, and local weights and measures, etc.</p>
<p>If each of these is studied in detail, all problems can be solved easily.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>The direct parties involved in consignment trade are the consignor and the consignee. Once the consignor has obtained the consignee's consent to sell the goods on their behalf, a contract should be signed, and the following matters should be noted:</p>
<p>(1) Agreement on Commissions: Commissions are the consignee's only income in consignment trade. Even if the consignor suffers losses as a result of the sales, they must be responsible for payment. Therefore, it is essential to clearly specify the fee rates in the contract in advance. Although the percentages may not be consistent due to different commercial customs in different places, they are usually determined based on the actual sales figures of the goods. There are also those who calculate it based on the prices listed in the shipping documents. For foods and fruits, etc., after being transported for a long time, some are inevitably spoiled. After inspection by the commodity inspection office, only those that are intact are allowed to be sold. Therefore, according to the customs in Liverpool, England, the commission that the consignee should receive is not based on the actual sales figures of the goods; even the goods that are rejected as a result of inspection are also treated as sold and must pay commissions to the consignee. Therefore, when encountering such special customs, the calculation of commissions should be clearly stipulated at the time of contracting to avoid future disputes.</p>
<p>(2) Guarantee of Payment: For consigned goods that the consignee extends credit to customers, there is a risk of delays or defaults in payment. Therefore, for safety's sake, the consignor should enter into a Delcredere Contract with the consignee, so that there will be a certain guarantee in case of danger in the future. However, after concluding this type of contract, the consignee's responsibility is inevitably increased. Therefore, the consignor usually gives a certain Delcredere Commission as special remuneration, and the percentage is always determined according to market customs.</p>
<p>(3) Conclusion of Documentary Bill Contract and Payment of the Balance: The goods consigned to the consignee are essentially a type of consignment sale, not a purchase by the consignee themselves. Therefore, in principle, payment should only be made after the goods are sold. However, in order to facilitate the consignor's financial circulation and maintain the entrusted relationship for a long time, the consignee usually allows the consignor to issue bills of exchange using the shipped goods as collateral, with themselves as the payer, which is the so-called documentary draft. As for the amount that can be used for documentary bills, if it is only decided by the consignor unilaterally, it will inevitably be too large. Generally, the two parties decide based on 60-70% of the price listed in the shipping document. The remaining amount should be returned by the consignee to the consignor, and the timing and method of payment can be determined separately.</p>
<p>(4) Agreement on Interest: For consigned goods, on the one hand, before they are sold, the consignee must pay the documentary bill amount and also pay import taxes, tonnage taxes, storage fees, inspection fees, and other miscellaneous expenses on behalf of the consignor. On the other hand, after the goods are sold, the consignee can freely use the proceeds within a certain period of time. Therefore, a creditor-debtor relationship arises between them at the same time. To avoid future disputes, both parties should agree on the interest rate for incoming and outgoing amounts in the contract to be appropriate.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief overview of the matters that consignors and exporters should pay attention to in consignment trade, focusing on the major aspects. In fact, the way to promote a country's international trade lies in those engaged in the export business personally standing on the front lines, going to overseas markets in person, and directly contacting foreign consumers, and then they will be able to awaken their potential desires and eliminate those who compete with us. Only then can the general trend of trade have the hope of being developed and promoted. Looking at the situation after the European War, American manufacturers have changed their previous mentality of entrusting German merchants to sell and have established their own overseas branch offices. The British even said that the reason why Japanese goods are rampant and swept the world is that their merchants enter other countries' markets directly without relying on local merchants. Therefore, consignment sales can only be regarded as a temporary measure in the process of developing overseas markets and cannot be regarded as a regular practice.</p>
<h3 id="e219">A Review of Our Country's Cooperative Law <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Honggen</p>
<p>The cooperative society is a new type of enterprise in our country, originating in the eighth year of the Republic of China. It has only been around for a little over a decade. Initially, it was not popular because the general public did not understand the meaning and importance of cooperation. Although the authorities had the will to promote cooperative enterprises, they were unable to do so due to the country's many troubles. Therefore, they could only let this newborn infant seek its own maintenance, and the cooperative enterprise has survived in this situation for more than a decade. This can be regarded as a common phenomenon in the early stage of the cooperative movement in various countries around the world. However, in the process of gradual evolution, it is inevitable that some legal problems will arise. Therefore, the need for cooperative laws and regulations is becoming more and more urgent. Therefore, by the middle of the nineteenth century, major European countries had successively formulated cooperative laws and regulations. Some are attached to the general commercial law without indicating the words "cooperative society", such as the French Cooperative Law; some are attached to the commercial law but specifically indicate the name of the cooperative society, and a special chapter is devoted to discussing it, such as the cooperative laws of Switzerland, Belgium, Italy, Sweden, and other countries; another type is to order separate laws and regulations for cooperative societies outside the general commercial law, such as the British Cooperative Law; among them, the third type is the most suitable, and most countries have adopted this system when formulating cooperative laws in recent years.</p>
<p>The existence of cooperative laws in our country can be traced back to Mr. Dai Jitao's Draft Industrial Cooperative Law in the ninth year of the Republic of China. Later, the provincial and municipal governments realized the increasing importance of cooperative enterprises, and successively formulated cooperative laws and regulations, no less than a dozen in total. They are listed below:</p>
<p>Law Name Implementation Area Implementation Period</p>
<p>Draft Industrial Cooperative Law Nationwide Not implemented</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province Provisional Regulations on Cooperative Societies Jiangsu July of the 17th year</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Provisional Regulations on Consumer Cooperative Societies Shanghai October of the 17th year</p>
<p>Shandong Provisional Articles of Association for Cooperative Societies Shandong November of the 18th year</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province Regulations on Cooperative Societies Zhejiang December of the 18th year</p>
<p>Nanjing Municipal Provisional Articles of Association for Cooperative Societies Nanjing Same as above</p>
<p>Articles of Association for Forestry Cooperative Societies Guangdong Same as above</p>
<p>Jiangxi Province Provisional Regulations on Cooperative Societies Jiangxi February of the 19th year</p>
<p>Hebei Province Provisional Regulations on Cooperative Societies Hebei April of the 19th year</p>
<p>Hankou Municipal Provisional Articles of Association for Cooperative Societies Hankou July of the 19th year</p>
<p>Hunan Province Provisional Regulations on Cooperative Societies Hunan March of the 21st year</p>
<p>Regulations on Rural Cooperative Societies in Bandit Suppression Areas Rural October of the 21st year</p>
<p>The above-mentioned cooperative laws and regulations are all local. Their content either imitates Japan or simulates each other, and most of them are incomplete. At a time when cooperative enterprises are booming, a unified set of laws and regulations is needed to enable cooperative enterprises to enter a proper and unified path. However, our country's cooperative laws and regulations are so scattered and fragmented, each going its own way. Difficulties are felt in all aspects of guidance and control, and obstacles have arisen in the future of cooperative enterprises. The government also recognized the importance of this matter, and in May of the 20th year, the Ministry of Industry formulated the Provisional Regulations on Rural Cooperative Societies, hoping that they could be implemented throughout the country. However, the result was that very few provinces and localities followed them. Moreover, since these regulations were promulgated by ministerial order, they were not reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan and formally promulgated by the National Government. There were some omissions in the legislative procedure, and it is also doubtful whether they have sufficient effectiveness for promotion. Therefore, the Central Political Council decided on ten major principles of the Cooperative Law in September of the 21st year of the Republic of China. Based on these principles, the Legislative Yuan drafted a Draft Cooperative Law, consisting of nine chapters and eighty-seven articles. In November of the same year, the Economic Committee of the Legislative Yuan reviewed and revised it, reducing it to nine chapters and seventy-six articles. It was passed by the Central Political Council, and formally promulgated by the National Government on March 1st of the 23rd year, named the Cooperative Law. The various points in its content have been repeatedly scrutinized by experts, and it should be much more complete than the laws implemented by various provinces and cities in the past. Moreover, there are several points of superiority that are not available in the cooperative laws of other countries. However, since our country's experience in cooperative enterprises is still shallow, lawmakers may rely on precedents or make presumptions, and there may be one or two points that can be criticized. Now, based on my humble opinion, I will select the important points for analysis and discussion. It is inevitable that there may be some biased views. Readers are requested to point them out.</p>
<p>(1) Stipulations on the Nature of Cooperative Societies 丨丨 It goes without saying that cooperative societies are different from ordinary companies. The Cooperative Law should first state the nature of cooperation to prevent other for-profit organizations from misappropriating the name of cooperative societies and obtaining various legal protections and privileges (such as tax exemptions). According to the laws and regulations of various countries, this point is often not clearly expressed, resulting in the existence of many fake cooperative societies. For example, the Swiss Cooperative Law states that a cooperative society is an organization formed by a group of individuals with a common economic purpose, which seems too broad. Article 1 of our country's Cooperative Law states: "The cooperative society referred to in this law refers to a group that is based on the principle of equality, on the basis of mutual aid, uses common management methods to seek the economic interests and improve the lives of its members, and whose number of members and amount of capital can be changed." This provision can help the general public understand the nature of cooperative societies and can distinguish between for-profit organizations that falsely claim to be cooperative societies. Therefore, I believe that this point is a major feature of our country's Cooperative Law.</p>
<p>(2) Statement of the Business and Responsibilities of Cooperative Societies 丨丨 According to Article 5 of Chapter 1 of the Cooperative Law, "The business and responsibilities of the cooperative society shall be stated in its name." For example, "Moling Town Shuangling Township Agricultural Production Utilization and Marketing Limited Liability Cooperative Society" has a total of twenty-one characters. Some people think that the name is too long and inconvenient to read, and it is even more difficult for farmers to understand its meaning. Mr. Dong Shijin said that the best way to name a cooperative society is to determine it according to the actual duties, such as "irrigation cooperation" and "cultivated land consolidation cooperation," without using formal words such as "production" and "marketing." I think that the main function of the name is to deal with the outside world. On the one hand, it is for registration procedures, and at the same time, it gives the outside world a concept of the business of the cooperative society. Moreover, in the immature state of cooperative enterprises in China, it is not appropriate if the names cannot be unified. In order to take into account the convenience of legislation and facts, the name can be reduced as much as possible without impairing its concept. For example, the last two characters of "limited liability" can be removed. If several businesses are operated concurrently, the first character of each business can be taken to form the name. In this way, the aforementioned name can be changed to "Moling Town Shuangling Township Agricultural Production Utilization Limited Cooperative Society." Sometimes the three characters "Moling Town" can also be omitted, leaving only twelve characters.</p>
<p>(3) Concurrent Operation of Businesses 丨 For countries where cooperative enterprises are just starting, those who engage in them are prone to failure because they are not familiar with the details. The center of cooperative enterprise promotion in our country is farmers and lower-middle-class society. Their knowledge is already insufficient, and their cooperative skills are even more lacking. It is difficult to operate several businesses concurrently. Otherwise, it will only be a matter of making false claims, which will not help the actual situation or even cause losses. Article 3 of the Cooperative Law stipulates that "The business of the cooperative society may be one or several of the items listed in this article," which indicates that concurrent operation is possible. However, we need to recognize the factual difficulties. At least in the next few years, the business of a cooperative society should not be too complicated. If several businesses are related and cannot be separated, we can also examine their performance and actual situation before operating other businesses concurrently, so that there is no risk of failure. In short, the government authorities should take a guiding position in cooperative enterprises, which is by no means comparable to the laissez-faire situation in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding Registration Procedures 丨 According to Article 8 of Chapter 2 of the law, the cooperative society shall, within one month after convening the founding meeting, passing the articles of association, electing directors and supervisors, and organizing the board of directors, register with the competent authority at its location. The articles of association referred to here do not stipulate a certain format and content for reference, and the competent authority at the location is not clearly defined as an administrative agency (such as in Japan) or a judicial agency (Germany). According to Article 9, "After receiving the application mentioned in the previous article, the competent authority shall issue an approval or disapproval within fifteen days." If this can be implemented, it is also optimistic. However, in fact, government offices are extremely slow to handle matters. Moreover, administrative officials in remote provinces do not understand the importance of cooperation. It is feared that this registration procedure will be difficult to complete so quickly. For example, there are several cooperative societies in Hebei that have been trained for many years and have the assistance of the China International Famine Relief Commission, but they have not yet completed the registration procedures. In other countries, if the government office makes it difficult to register, the cooperative society can still have the right to appeal to the High Court (such as in the United Kingdom), but there is no provision for this point in our country's Cooperative Law, which inevitably hinders the future of cooperative enterprises.</p>
<p>(5) Member Liability 丨 Article 11 of the Cooperative Law states: "...Members of unlimited liability cooperative societies shall not be members of other unlimited liability cooperative societies." From the wording, this article is very complete and can prevent cross-membership and protect cooperative societies from losses. However, the actual situation may not be the case. The reason is that Chinese farm families are different from the small family system in Europe and the United States. Fathers, sons, and brothers live together in one place, and most of their properties have not been separated. Now, if two brothers are both of legal age and join Cooperative Society A and Cooperative Society B as unlimited liability members, what should be done if one of the societies suffers a loss and the entire property is taken out for compensation, and then the other society suffers a loss again? This is a major problem. Moreover, in recent years, credit cooperation has been the most developed, and members often falsely use the names of others to join multiple societies in order to obtain loans. This phenomenon poses a great difficulty in legislation and must be prevented.</p>
<p>(6) Member Subscription Shares and Amount per Share 丨 According to Article 15, "Each member shall subscribe to at least one share, and no more than 20% of the total shares... The amount per share shall be at least one yuan in national currency and no more than twenty yuan." The restriction on the amount of shares subscribed is to prevent the monopoly of a few members. As for the amount per share, some countries have set a maximum amount (such as Japan, which stipulates that the amount per share shall not exceed 50 yen), and our country also restricts its minimum amount. I think there are at least two shortcomings: (1) Lack of flexibility 丨 If there is no minimum amount, it can be freely adjusted below the maximum amount. The share capital can be low when there are many members and high when there are few members. (2) The economic conditions of general workers and farmers are low, and the amount of two yuan may be slightly high.</p>
<p>(7) Dividends 丨 The law stipulates that the interest on cooperative shares "shall not exceed 1% per annum." It is not appropriate to give interest on cooperative shares. As Mr. Dai said in the principle of industrial cooperative societies, "Distributing profits based on the amount of investment is not in the spirit of cooperation." The dividend on ordinary company shares is only 1% per annum at most, and the dividend on cooperative shares is also stipulated to be so high, which truly loses the meaning of cooperation.</p>
<p>(8) Member Withdrawal 丨 The cooperative laws of various countries mostly recognize the right of cooperative society members to request withdrawal. Article 24 of the Cooperative Law promulgated this time states: "Members may withdraw from the society at the end of the year, but shall submit a written request three months in advance." This restricts the opportunity to withdraw to the end of the year. It will be inconvenient for withdrawing members who have moved to a distant place to change jobs. My intention is to divide one year into two periods, that is, there is an opportunity to withdraw every six months. In this way, the society's handling of affairs will not be inconvenienced much, and it will indeed benefit the withdrawing members greatly.</p>
<p>(9) Cooperative Society Inspection Matters 丨 Regarding the inspection of cooperative societies, the laws of various countries have clear provisions. For example, the United Kingdom and India are subject to the inspection of judicial agencies, Germany and Austria are subject to the inspection of the "Inspection Union" of the cooperative society's autonomous organs, and Japan is subject to the supervision of administrative agencies. In our country, which is in the stage of nurturing cooperative enterprises, we should also imitate this system so that they can develop in an orderly manner. However, the Cooperative Law only stipulates that internal supervisors, members, and creditors can review the financial and business situation, and does not stipulate what kind of agency outside the society can supervise it.</p>
<p>(10) Liability of Directors 丨 Article 35 stipulates: "When a cooperative society operating the business in Article 3, Paragraph 4 is unable to repay its savings debts, the directors shall be jointly and severally liable for repayment." The so-called business in Article 3, Paragraph 4 refers to credit cooperation, which is the most prone to losses. The law stipulates that the directors shall be jointly and severally liable for repayment. The directors are elected from the members by the members' meeting and are no different from other members. They only need to be citizens of the Republic of China, be over 20 years old, and have a legitimate occupation to be elected (see Article 10 of the Cooperative Law). Under these simple conditions, it is indeed questionable whether they should bear such a heavy responsibility. Whether the directors should also have other conditions (such as a minimum amount of assets) is a question for discussion today. Otherwise, this provision is equivalent to being in vain. 丨</p>

<h3 id="e220">Finance: Little Change in the Foreign Market <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>The silver market has been stable in recent days. Yesterday was Sunday, and most banks were closed, which made the market feel even more stagnant. The foreign exchange rate was still six points in the morning and afternoon markets. In the exchange of foreign exchange tickets, more than 2.9 million was traded in the morning market for account transfers and new transactions, more than 500,000 was traded in the afternoon market, more than 300,000 was traded in the Small General Association, and more than 500,000 was traded in foreign exchange mortgage transactions for redemption and more than 800,000 in new transactions. As for bank collections and settlements, they were completely stagnant due to the Sunday holiday. Only the money industry had more than 38 million in foreign public bill collections and settlements and more than 600,000 in remittances from various places. Although there were occasional ups and downs in subsidiary coins, they were very small.

<h3 id="e221">Securities: Little Fluctuation in the Bond Market Last Week <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>The week from October 8th to 13th at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was extremely uneventful. Most parties were watching and holding each other back, waiting for changes in the environment. Opinions differed, but in general, short selling was the majority. However, the environment was brewing and continued to be depressed, and there was no remedy for going long. Therefore, the market price did not change much. However, the future situation is still very complicated, and news fluctuations are still unavoidable. Bond market fluctuations cannot always be so quiet. Last week, on Monday, rumors of rampant Sichuan bandits caused the market price to fall. Most of the table was short, falling by about half a yuan. On Tuesday, the foreign exchange rate was reduced to six points, and news of Ning-Yue cooperation was widely spread. No. 50 and No. 56 were the most actively bought, and the market price rebounded by about half a yuan. Wednesday was Double Ten Day, and the market was closed for one day. On Thursday, the constitution was gradually improved, and people's hearts were relatively stable. Short positions were the majority in swaps, and the market price rose more than it fell. On Friday, various company and firm stocks were auctioned off, and spot trading involved about a dozen varieties. Seven varieties were opened on the same day. The market price of public bonds was also relatively firm. Shorts in the market slightly covered or went long, which was slightly better by half a yuan. The market hovered and stabilized on Saturday, with ups and downs seen, but the amount was also small. In summary, the market price results for the week were slightly better by 1 jiao to 4 jiao, which shows how stagnant the market was. The total turnover was 69.21 million yuan, and 340 shares of various stocks were traded. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (13th), the New York stock market was unusually sluggish and had no highlights. It was rumored that the government currently has no intention of reducing the fineness of the US dollar, and some bulls slightly closed out their positions, so the prices were slightly lower. The turnover for half a day was 410,000 shares. According to the New York agent of this firm, the cotton market rebounded after falling, because today's news denied inflating the currency. Traders tended to wait for Washington to clarify its plan to raise prices before trading again. The total number of yarn mill imports last week was 220,000 bales, and the consumption in September was 295,960 bales. The grain market did not reflect the weakness of the overseas market. There was good buying when prices fell, and the spot situation was still strong. The drought in the Southwest region was also an important factor in the market.

<p>Yesterday, US cotton was weak due to the lack of major buyers, poor news from Liverpool, and foreign merchants selling. The spot price fell by 10 pounds per pound, and the futures price fell by 6 to 15 pounds per pound. British cotton futures fell by 12 points.

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than thirty suppliers arrived, totaling over four thousand five to six hundred shi (units of dry measure). The majority were still "kiln-grown" rice. Fortunately, the local market demand was relatively active, giving the market a stable appearance. However, due to the temporary closure of the 'Bao Wei' (likely a market or trading organization) for the week, there was some apprehension among buyers, resulting in a slightly softer market tone. As a result, Baige rice struggled to maintain its position. White rice and thick new japonica rice saw varied prices due to abundant supply. Although the supply of Du Yang Jian was still not robust, the situation was not as favorable as the previous days; only high-quality varieties saw an increase of a few cents. Medium-quality rice remained stable, and broken rice saw no significant change. Bian Yuan rice also became more stable. However, new Yin Yuan rice remained in strong demand for Zifan (rice porridge), with prices continuing to increase by a few cents.</p>

There were also sales of new Yang Jian, old Bai Yuan, kiln-grown, new and old Bu Jian, and guest Jian rice, with ordinary retail sales. Old Yang Jian rice was scarce and sold well. The market saw new japonica high-quality rice up a small fraction, while medium and lower grades were sluggish by a few points. High-quality broken japonica was similar, while medium and lower grades were slightly tighter. New Yang and Du Jian prices were weak. Old Bai Yuan kiln-grown prices were down slightly by a dime.

<p>The recent tinplate market has been exceptionally good. Local factories and buyers from Tianjin, Qingdao, Pinghan, and other regions have shown strong demand, leading to substantial transactions. Records show that in the past two to three days, over 1,600-1,700 dan (units of weight) have been traded. Due to the sharp rise in foreign exchange rates, prices are not expected to increase. Current market opening prices for 90-pound American tinplate with a single coat are 15.75 yuan, and 100-pound tinplate is 16.50 yuan. 90-pound tinplate with a double coat is 32 yuan, and 100-pound tinplate is 33.50 yuan. German and Italian tinplate with a 90-pound single coat is 15.25 yuan, and 100-pound tinplate is 15.75 yuan. 90-pound tinplate with a double coat is 33.50 yuan, and 100-pound tinplate is 31.50 yuan. British and French tinplate are out of stock, so there are no market reports. (Twenty-two, eleven yuan)</p>

<h3 id="e227">On Smoking <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Shuxian</p>
<p>According to news from the Jianghai Customs Statistics Department, the recent annual consumption of cigarettes in various provinces across the country, excluding frequent instances of private manufacturing and tax evasion, amounts to a staggering 400 million yuan annually. This alarming figure forms a striking contrast with the country's entire population.</p>
<p>The Chinese seem particularly interested in smoking, and cigarettes seem to have an extraordinary connection with the Chinese. From esteemed gentlemen to those picking up cigarette butts on the streets, old and young, men and women, regardless of social status, everyone loves to have a cigarette in their mouth. Although cigarettes vary in quality and price, all cigarettes are smokable. Those who don't smoke seem out of place. Based on individual economic circumstances, this has created a massive consumption figure.</p>
<p>Smoking not only provides no benefit to the human body but also causes significant harm. This is something that everyone in the current 20th century seems to understand. However, smokers knowingly violate this principle, even willing to eat less but unable to resist smoking a cigarette. The first greeting between friends is a cigarette, and a cigarette is also used when feeling mentally exhausted or physically tired. Theaters, dance halls, and various public entertainment venues in major cities, as well as toilet rooms in schools, organizations, and factories, have become major bases for cigarette consumption!</p>
<p>I am also a die-hard smoker and have twice made up my mind to quit, but each time I couldn't last more than ten days before unconsciously falling back into old habits. This is, of course, partly due to my lack of willpower, but also because smoking has become a common social habit.</p>
<p>It is generally agreed that smoking should be quit, especially in these times of economic panic and difficult living conditions. However, how to implement a quitting method is a very difficult problem to solve! In my opinion, the only way to achieve good results is to voluntarily adopt the method of smoking less rather than more, not smoking rather than smoking less, and never smoking rather than not smoking.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Autumn at Paotai Bay <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Yefei</p>
<p>The rice stalks in the fields have turned golden, and farmers are busy harvesting the crystallization of their hard work and sweat.</p>
<p>Those of us who live in noisy cities year-round feel as if we are in another world when we enter the embrace of nature. The hardships of life and the vulgarity of the city are all swept away to the other side of the Atlantic, and one feels much clearer at heart.</p>
<p>Drifting, drifting; I drift along the Huangpu River. If not for the golden rice stalks interspersed with the oily green wilderness on both sides, I would almost forget that it is autumn!</p>
<p>A huge riverboat in the river slowly sails out of the Wusongkou. Several motorboats are shooting like arrows, cutting through the river's surface and breaking the yellow and turbid waves. The waves splash onto the bank, making a roaring sound.</p>
<p>The twilight envelops the earth, and the evening glow follows the setting sun, reflecting a beautiful golden yellow on the rippling sea. The scattered sails in the distance are tilted forward in the leisurely misty waves, and several lone ducks flap their wings and soar into the sky.</p>
<p>"The setting sun flies together with the lone duck, and the autumn water shares the same color with the long sky." This beautiful picture! Only at this time, only in this place, can I appreciate and enjoy it.</p>
<p>A large crowd of people is gathered on the bank of the Three Gorges Waterway, talking and laughing. These are men and women who have squeezed out of the city, preparing to come here for a breath of fresh air. The sea breeze glides over everyone's faces, and their clothes flap in the wind. The women's hair flutters in the wind, and gusts of wind roll up the dust and sand on the ground and send them flying into the air.</p>
<p>A very long stone embankment in front of me is exposed on the sea surface, lying quietly in the yellow and turbid waves. Many men and women are venturing on the embankment, and my feet are itching, so I finally jump onto the embankment and run forward desperately, running forward. However, its ruggedness and steepness are even more difficult than the Shu Road. With just a moment of carelessness, there is a danger of slipping into the sea and joining the wave gods! However, seeing four or five modern misses and misters walking peacefully in front of us, I can't help but feel ashamed!</p>
<p>At the end of the stone embankment, under the lighthouse, two girls are sitting, taking off their swimsuits, wiping the water stains from their bodies, and putting on blue serge cheongsams. However, their shoes and socks are not yet on, and they are standing and laughing like barefoot immortals.</p>
<p>Looking at a patch of azure sky, white clouds are slowly moving, really like a wisp of light smoke, and gradually fading away in an instant. A light blue warship is moored outside the Three Gorges Waterway, without flags or smoke, standing quietly, lifelessly, like a dying old man. Raging waves roll toward the stone embankment, stirring up a magnificent roar, and the waves soak our clothes.</p>
<p>Stepping onto the bank, I want to admire the true face of Mount Lu at the West Fort, but a wire mesh blocks the way: "As instructed: No visitors allowed. Notice from the Wusong Fort Administrator." In the lotus pond beside the road, the green lotuses still grow thickly like umbrellas, but there are no water lilies, and they are already showing some signs of withering!</p>
<p>Over there, two young men in suits are tightly embracing a girl in student uniform and walking on the grass. Here, a girl in green and a girl in red are leaning on the same young man's arms and eating purple grapes. What is going on? I think that is spring in autumn!</p>
<p>The vast night is pressing down tightly, and smoke is rising from the roofs of rural homes. I ride in a bright moon-like small car, creaking back to Paotaiwan Station, and finally the short little train drags us back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Bank Failures <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Xinzi</p>
<p>Not long after the Wuhua Bank failed, now the China Industrial Bank has also failed. Although the reasons for the failures are all due to the failure of speculative ventures, and the managers had to leave when they were in dire straits, the fact that the banking sector has not been able to develop normally due to economic stagnation in recent years, and thus had to invest in other areas, is also a major reason.</p>
<p>In recent years, the banking sector has seen cash concentrated in the cities due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy, while urban industry and commerce have been in a state of decline due to the recession. Given these two reasons, the amount of cash held by banks has been increasing day by day. On the other hand, expenses cannot be reduced, and the interest rates for depositors increase daily. Lending money is risky in such a market, as there is a fear that it will not be repaid. If no loans are made, the money will not generate more money while sitting in the vault. Under layers of difficulties, the banking sector only has two options: speculative ventures and investments in real estate.</p>
<p>The first path is to invest in margin trading of public bonds, or even the wheat and cotton markets, using one's own judgment to leverage depositors' money, hoping to profit in the process. However, this is an extremely dangerous path, and the manager's occasional carelessness can easily lead to complete defeat.</p>
<p>The second path is to invest in real estate, the most common approach being to build large buildings. On the one hand, the empty rooms are rented out to others, and on the other hand, this wins the trust of depositors while increasing the bank's fixed assets. The future rental income from this large property is used to pay interest to depositors and generate profits for the bank itself.</p>
<p>The risks of the first path have been mentioned above. The second path is also not a proper one. Although the buildings are built, the emptiness of the vault is inevitable. If a financial crisis were to occur, would the bank not be forced to close down immediately? Considering the purpose of banks themselves, they should be regulating the economy. By spending large sums of money in these two areas, isn't the bank itself becoming empty?</p>

<p>Therefore, in view of the recent failures of two banks, and the alarming shadow of many other banks in the future, for the sake of the stability of the national economy, we should take both active and passive measures.</p>
<p>Actively, the current concentration of cash in the cities (more accurately, in the banks) is related to solving the entire social problem. We hope that the authorities and financial giants will come up with sound plans.</p>
<p>Passively, we ask the Bankers Association to publicly report the names of its member and non-member banks, and to clearly state the ultimate responsibility of its members, guaranteed by them. Furthermore, they should regularly send personnel to inspect existing members, and should give careful consideration to new members seeking to join.</p>
<p>In this way, we can avoid causing people to be at a loss, and the national economy will not be greatly affected.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Men of Letters and Poverty <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Yugong</p>
<p>In the past and present, when a man of letters is praised by society as "poor but ambitious," he mostly takes it as a qualification to be proud of. In reality, there are very, very few truly poor men of letters.</p>
<p>Take Yan Hui, a worthy disciple of Confucius, for example. Confucius praised him, "Hui is worthy. He lives in a humble alley without any resentment." He seems to be an extremely poor man, but he had thirty mu (unit of land) of fields attached to the city, which makes him a small landlord. Take Tao Yuanming, the pastoral poet, for example. Because he left behind a poem about begging for food, it gives people the impression that he was a poor poet, but when he returned home rather than bowing down for five dou (unit of measure) of rice, he still had welcoming servants and overgrown fields. In reality, he was a considerable landlord.</p>
<p>A friend told me that in ancient times, saying someone was poor meant they didn't hold official office.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is verifiable. However, based on the examples of Yan Hui and Tao Yuanming mentioned above, it is certainly reliable.</p>
<p>Extending from this, it can be seen that those who held official office in ancient times were rich people, and officials were also called nobles. It can be seen that when a man of letters became an official, he gained both wealth and status. This idea—promotion and fortune—was the same for men of letters in ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>However, the ancients also had a deceptive saying that writing "improves with poverty," meaning to encourage poor men of letters to "accept their fate" and that while they lack material possessions, they have better reputations. But those who said that certainly didn't understand the plight of the poor, it's utter nonsense. A person who worries about clothing and food all day long doesn't even have the mood to write, so how can there be good writing? This is the experience of all poor men of letters. There are more and more deceptive sayings from the ancients, this is just a small example.</p>
<p>Furthermore, nowadays, a man of letters who loses his job can make a living by selling his writing, which is much better than unemployed workers. This is something that poor men of letters should not blame fate for.</p>

<p>At midnight, the trees outside the window are rustling in the autumn wind, and the dim yellow light of the street lamp at the corner of the alley is swaying in the wind. The gauze curtain on the window is beautifully printed with layers of floating shadows of leaves. The sky is just black and dull.</p>
<p>My lonely heart is even more melancholy on this deep autumn night. As if I were sleepless, one fantasy after another flits across my eyes, plunging me deeply into a dream of fantasy, recalling the joys and sorrows of life.</p>
<p>The stagnant sky is even darker, and the wind is blowing even more fiercely. In an instant, it has started to rain. Ah! The autumn night rain brings an even thicker chill.</p>
<p>The autumn wind blows fiercely through the rain, and the glass on the window is pattering. In the quiet atmosphere of this deep alley, the sound of the rain is so frightening, it's as if a person in the desert is listening to the howling wind, that's how frightening it is.</p>
<p>From far, far away, a burst of long, low singing comes, mixed with the sound of rain, flying into my ears, startling me from my dream state. Curiously, I stretch my head and look out the window through the glass.</p>
<p>Gradually, the singing subsides, and only the melodious sound of the bamboo flute is heard. But that sound carries a sad melody. In an instant, the woman's singing starts again, her song also so sad, harmonizing with the flute.</p>
<p>Ah! This is the song of a blind girl, and in the quiet alley of this late night, it seems especially desolate and tragic. The most feared thing for a wanderer is to hear the lament of another wanderer!</p>
<p>The rain is still falling, the sky is still so black and gloomy, and my heart is even more lonely and sad. Ah! The sadness of the wanderer!</p>
<p>The surroundings of the night are so quiet, so empty!</p>
<p>The blind girl's singing finally fades away, and my heart feels a burst of emptiness! Surrounding my deep heart is an even more terrifying loneliness.</p>
<p>Ah! Wanderer, your heart is destined to be lonely forever.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Divorce Procedures <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am a miserable woman bound by an old-fashioned marriage. In my childhood, my parents arranged for me to marry a man who had returned from abroad. At that time, I was about sixteen or seventeen years old, and my knowledge was very naive, and I had not yet thought about the pain of old-fashioned marriages. For two years after the marriage, I did not feel any trouble. Later, he said he wanted to go abroad again to make a living, so we were separated and could not meet. At first, he still sent letters frequently and sent my living expenses from time to time. However, soon, not only did he not remit living expenses, but also the letters became fewer. Because my source of income was cut off, I had to return to my mother's home and live off my father and brothers. For more than three years, I sent several letters, but he only replied to one, saying that he was unemployed in another place and had not yet found a suitable job, so he could not keep his promise to send living expenses back. Because he had not found a job and had not returned to his home country, it seemed like he had abandoned me. Therefore, I had no choice but to hire a lawyer to write him a letter, hoping that he would strictly abide by his promise and remit living expenses every month, otherwise we would dissolve the relationship. His reply was very vague, almost the same as the previous letter. Now I have asked the lawyer to write a second letter, saying that if he does not keep his promise, we will have to divorce. However, his reply has not yet arrived.</p>
<p>I am now suffering terribly and don't know what the future holds. I have the following three questions and hope that you can help me resolve them.</p>
<p>(1) If he does not provide living expenses for more than three years, can I declare a dissolution of the relationship and freedom to marry by publishing a statement in the newspaper myself? Is this legally problematic?</p>
<p>(2) If, after the second letter from the lawyer mentioned above, I do not wait for his reply and marry myself, will the letter from the Shanghai lawyer have the effect of a "divorce"?</p>
<p>(3) If I do not leave Shanghai, can I sue him for paying the previous living expenses and compensation for losses?</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted, Biryun</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The questions you have asked cannot be legally established and have many difficult circumstances. I will answer them separately below:</p>
<p>(1) If someone's whereabouts are unknown for more than three years, it constitutes a reason to sue for divorce. However, a lawsuit must be filed in court, and a divorce can only be legal after a divorce is granted. If one party declares a divorce in the newspaper, it is illegal and therefore invalid. Furthermore, failure to provide living expenses can only be reported as malicious abandonment, which is also a reason to sue for divorce, but it is not the same as whereabouts being unknown.</p>
<p>(2) Marrying someone else without going through legal divorce procedures constitutes bigamy. Publishing in the newspaper and the lawyer's notice have no divorce effect. Apart from the fact that divorce can be agreed upon by both parties for any reason, if it is the will of one party, it is not effective unless there is a legal reason and a judgment by the court.</p>
<p>(3) If you do not leave Shanghai and sue for divorce, it is possible, but the other party must also be from Shanghai, otherwise the Shanghai court has no jurisdiction. As for the repayment of living expenses and compensation for losses, it depends on whether there is sufficient reason.</p>

Which made Zhang Jinfeng, Thirteenth Sister and others laugh for a while. Thirteenth Sister asked Young Master An why he didn't wait at the Yuelai Inn. This made Young Master An feel ashamed and nowhere to hide. He wanted to commit suicide with Thirteenth Sister's steel knife. After a commotion, people were covered in sweat. Thirteenth Sister tracked down to the Nengren Temple on the road. She saved the two thousand taels of silver for Young Master An to save his father. Naturally, Young Master An's gratitude and admiration for her gradually revealed itself slightly. Thirteenth Sister was determined to do a "general doesn't dismount." You and I go our separate ways...</p>

<p>Parting with the Girl</p>
<p>Good girl, when I saw you, my heart was full of joy, but unfortunately, the time for meeting is short, and the time for parting is long. Good girl, I remember crossing mountains and seas with you, sleeping in the same room, talking and laughing in the same room. Good girl, you have now changed your mind, ignoring the long friendship, a bolt from the blue, how can I end up, how can I end up, how can I end up, parting with the girl.</p>
<p>Good girl, I felt extremely comforted when I saw you, but unfortunately your will is weak, unimaginable. Good girl, you are willing to sing with me until our hair turns white, as long as the sky and earth last, the sea dries and the rocks crumble, I swear not to have other thoughts. Good girl, you have now changed your mind, regardless of the emotional wounds for me and you, a bolt from the blue, how can I end up, how can I end up, how can I end up, parting with the girl.</p>
<p>The Lady Upstairs</p>
<p>The lady upstairs has very novel ideas, she doesn't live in tall buildings, but prefers to live in the attic; with messy hair and naked body, stretching and yawning, a soul lamp lit beside her head, a jade flute, kissing the rotten skin, collapsed on the bed, feet up.</p>
<p>Chee chee chee, chwee chwee chwee, exhaling clouds and spitting fog, truly happy, a sip of fragrant tea, three slices of pear, three consecutive pipes, a vivid spirit, the sister-in-law in the front building, the elder sister in the back building, who is long and who is short, who is right and who is wrong, sleeping in a dream in broad daylight, talking about heaven and earth in the deep night, youthful appearance. Face full of smoke, thin and yellow muscles, who doesn't pity, pity, pity the lady upstairs.</p>
<p>The lady upstairs, she really has no ambition, I used to see her so energetic, but now she is empty-handed and anxious, wearing broken shoes and clothes, unable to see her parents, unable to be close to her siblings, lonely and defeated, holding shame, mustering courage, old face, calculating, hahaha, hee hee hee, doing tricks in front of everyone, calling like a bird, crying like a chicken, shouting until her throat is broken, with only a few pennies, filled her stomach, yawning, smoking opium, her stomach is hungry, two meals a day, always anxious, occasionally wind and rain, empty, a handful of tears and a handful of snot, who doesn't sigh at this scene, who doesn't sigh, sighs for the lady upstairs.</p>
<p>Willow Silks</p>
<p>Willow silks are green. Pairs of swallows fly. Flying in pairs. Old sister across the street. Who are you waiting for to return? Thank you for caring about me. Tell me your story. The person with a broken heart. Difficult to say. Suffering is difficult to bear. Daring not to promise her lover. Sigh! Tears in her eyes when she sees her lover.</p>
<p>I heard long ago that my parents were going to arrange for me to marry a wealthy man. Too low. Not high enough. Staying in an empty room every night. A lover who knows my heart. Sigh? From now on, we are separated for a long time. Pitifully, I often sit by the window every night, unable to bear the sadness. For many years, I have often seen the sky every day, relying on the firewood door to look. Vaguely. Pitifully, I have seen only silk willows and purple swallows in pairs year after year. Look at the willow shade and swallow shadows reflecting the pond. Pond water, watery. No lover. Tears in my eyes.</p>
<p>Poor but Happy</p>
<p>Today is my lucky day, I have two banknotes in my pocket, great! Let's go and have fun! But our rent is not paid yet! It doesn't matter! It's okay to pay it in a few days, but I owe the sesame cake stall two strings of cash, and you owe the wonton stall three strings of cash, it doesn't matter, it's very little! Very little! But I pawned a cotton robe, and you also pawned a lined jacket, and your coat, (white)! It's not snowing yet! How much are your two banknotes worth in total? Two corners each, for a total of four hairs! Okay! Buy two corners and five hairs of Jia Pi wine, buy a packet of peanuts, peanuts and wine are called flower wine, let's be happy and laugh together, with less hate and no sorrow, dear friend, meet in a small building! If you are hungry tomorrow morning. Pawn your pants to buy steamed buns!</p>
