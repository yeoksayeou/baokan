<h3>五中全會開幕廷</h3>
<p>五中全會已於昨日開幕於首都。距前次四中全會之召集。適將一年。此一年中。國際形勢雖日見緊張。而國內政局。則漸趨安謚。福建事件。於四中全會召集之頃。已各結束。寗邊孫馬衝突。亦卽平定。各方領袖。多能體認其本身所處之地位。相與開誠以維護此多難之國家。餘如廢除苛雜之進行。敎育方針之釐訂。交通建設之孟晋。皆可供國人之稱述。而引爲國難期內差可安民慰之事實。最近盤踞東南一帶之赤匪。痛遭征勦。狼狽西竄。已成弩末。今後所應注意者。僅在匪區如何善後一事。設無水旱天災之蹂躏。則今年可謂爲國難發生以後比較最平穩之一年。亦可謂爲開始着手整理內政之一年。五中全會適在此年末召集。與會者得聚精會神。從容商榷今後救亡圖存之大計。而尤可喜者。西南方面諸領袖。自經王孫兩氏赴港接洽商榷之後。聞亦識認一致團結之必要。而表示諒解之意。則此次五中全會之召集。實全國一致奮起救國。以奠國家不㧞之基之關鍵也。</p>
<p>吾人固始終不信中國將從此一蹶不振。吾人亦不信我全國上下始終無奮發有爲勵精圖治之誠意與决心。故今次會議。吾人亦甚抱樂觀之期望。且聞今次出席人數之踴躍。已超過於以前各届之人數。而各委提案。不尙空言而注重於汪蔣二氏之感電。此尤足見人人抱有實事求是之决心。不欲以疏闊空洞之議論爲議塲之點綴也。感電首謂「今日救國之道。莫要於統一。而實現統統一。端在乎和平。」斯固國人一致之主張。必無任何異議者。至若以均權制爲劃分中央與地方權限之最高原則。明定於中山先生之建國大綱。今後欲在分權與集權之二種趨向下。求一折衷至當之道。亦舍此莫屬。實行均權制之具體辦法。業有感電。所述之五項建議。簡括扼要。站在中央軍政負責者之立塲。作此輪廓鮮明之共同宣言。其意義之重大。尤非文字所得而包羅。苟各委在討論感電之頃。能依此建議而預籌實行之方式與步驟。以謀和平一統的精神與手腕。消滅各種現實的阻礙。則斯會成就。必有超越於歷届會議之上者。至憲法爲國家根本大法。自須早日完成手續。以便將來國民大會通過後實施。則數年來準備結束訓政實行民治之志願。亦可由是而逹到。蔣委員長言。苟能以過去對於勦共之一致的心理。用之於救國。敢信任何危急之國家。無不可由我民衆一致之心理爲之挽救。斯言想各中委深具同心。和平統一之機。卽在乎是。斯又吾人所引領斯待也。</p>
<h3>新加坡間諜案日人將驅逐出境</h3>
<p>若干日人現被看管</p>
<p>日人住所仍在抄查</p>
<p>海軍操演嚴守秘密</p>
<p>新加坡新加坡今日滿佈被遏之興奮空氣、因日來所傳日人間諜一事、一切正式消息已經一種半官式之檢查禁止發表、湯邁斯總督請求報界立刻停止記載此事、當地長官亦各緘口不言、惟今日搜查日人寓所之事仍復進行、並有若干日人已被警署看管準備驅逐出境、惟官場雖嚴守秘密、一般人則以爲警署曾探得有間諜欲得新加坡防務之秘密消息、最重要者爲東北方面海空軍根據地及陸軍發展之計劃云、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>新加坡英國海軍操演定於星期四在此間舉行、內容嚴守秘密、與操演有關之計畫及消息、將於操演時通知當地居民、現在則因間諜案甚囂塵上、逐一無所聞、英國戰艦驅逐艦巡洋艦及飛機將參加海陸軍演習、以試騐最近擴大之新加坡要塞防務、此項操演旨在測騐海陸軍力能否應付敵人之襲擊、新加坡居民則因操演在卽及間諜案尤未結束、大有草木皆兵之槪、警察及其他當局偵查日本間諜亦諱莫如深、（十日國民電）</p>

<h3>英代表排解奏功中歐大局和緩</h3>
<p>南斯拉夫停止驅逐匈僑</p>
<p>國聯請匈牙利再行調查</p>
<p>（日內瓦）南斯拉夫匈牙利問題今日頗樂觀、兩國邦交近日緊張已極、現悉調和方案已在進行中、聞將勸令匈牙利重行調查若干官吏鼓勵南斯拉夫恐怖黨事、如犯罪屬實、應予懲治、雖法國爲南斯担夫張目、而意國爲匈牙利後援、但日內瓦法意二國代表現有良好之諒解、此爲時局中最有希望之特點、至於英國中立當然無疑問、衆料英代表艾登將被舉爲公判員、今日午後法外長賴伐爾以建議文送請國聯考慮、該文長六十頁、主張規定捕逃藪之權利、及政治犯之處理辦法、並主張設立國際法庭、處理碍及國際關係之政治罪行、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>貝爾格勒南斯拉夫內務大臣賴齊志今日下令、驅逐匈僑之舉必須立卽停止、卽寓南准許狀期滿者亦不得加以驅逐、據謂匈僑之被逐者大都由於地方官實施取締外僑條例熱心過度所致、</p>
<p>據日內瓦路透訪員電稱、南斯拉夫政府停止驅逐匈僑已使緊張之局勢爲之緩和、南政府取此行動、英掌璽大臣艾登昨在國聯行政院會議告誡之言必與有力、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>英法意草擬調解辦法</h3>
<p>兩派意見漸趨一致</p>
<p>（日內瓦）英代表艾登今日在此與意代表阿洛西及匈牙利外長康雅晤談良久、晚間艾登復與法外長賴伐爾及捷克外長皮尼士聚餐、英法司法專家亦在集議、南斯拉夫代表與其恊約國之代表今日午後亦同訪法外長賴伐爾、語以時局吃緊情形、英法意三國代表團刻正草擬一種决議案、此項决議案可爲南斯拉夫匈牙利爭執、趨向一種了解之第一步、艾登將於明日與各方面繼續談話、時局似稍轉佳現已大致决定者、艾登將爲南斯拉夫匈牙利問題之國聯報告員、</p>
<p>各國對於現局現分兩派、法國願國聯卽作决議、深以爭端延日愈久、危險愈甚、蓋不幸之事變或將使意國捲入漩渦也、英國主張見機行事、並反對使國聯匆遽作决、惟南斯拉夫·捷克·羅馬尼亞之代表無一願接受英代表之忠告、衆料明日國聯行政院開會時、羅馬尼亞外相蒂杜萊斯科將發激昻之演說、行政會昨延會至明日午後三時十五分、俾各代表互相談話、以緩和微近熱烈之空氣、</p>
<p>聞南斯拉夫政府要求於决議案中提及匈牙利若干官員之責任、而不欲與匈政府與匈利牙全國爲難、並已隱示、南政府如不能遂此願望、則將撤回對國聯之請願、而將與匈牙斷絶一切關係、以求滿意</p>
<p>同時小恊約國與巴爾幹恊約國對於昨日國聯行政院會議之演說、均表示不滿、彼等均覺國聯行政院完全漠視南斯拉夫政府備忘錄中所提之證據、對馬賽血案僅僅作讉責之空談、不能平息衆憤、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>英法商定决議草案三點</h3>
<p>當可爲各方接受</p>
<p>（日內瓦）自南斯拉夫與匈牙利之爭端向國聯會行政院提出後、解决頗爲困難、近日各方面人士多抱悲觀、然自昨日法國外長賴伐爾與英國掌璽大臣艾登會商後、形勢顯已趨於和緩、一般人相信艾登已接受法國所提决議草案三要點、此三要點對於南斯拉夫所提要求、當可予以滿足、卽（一）以普泛詞語指責恐怖主義、（二）援引國聯會盟約第十條、申明會員國負有尊重並保持各會員國領土完整、及政治獨立之義務、（三）由匈牙利重行開始偵查馬賽暗殺案責任所在、以上各要點聞已由英法及小恊商各國代表昨夜商得同意、現須徵求同意者僅意大利與匈牙利而已、因此艾登業於今晨與意匈兩國代表會商、并於午刻赴賴伐爾寓所、賴伐爾亦卽召集小恊商各國代表、共同討論、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）聞國聯行政院將舉派小委員會考量法外長賴伐爾提出之建議文、據現情觀之、寬恕被控任何人之最高權、將在國聯之掌握中、（十日路透電）</p>
<h3>法外長主張訂立國際公約</h3>
<p>取締恐怖主義</p>
<p>（日內瓦）本日法外長賴伐爾與希臘·南斯拉夫·意大利·英國·及捷克代表陸續晤談、尙未商得能使匈牙利及南斯拉夫可以承認之解决辦法、賴氏熱烈援助南斯拉夫、並極力主張訂立國際上取締恐怖行爲之辦法、俾馬賽發生之一類案件不致再度發生、英意代表與賴伐爾同意、以爲關於馬賽案應先求得一種可爲關係國所接受之解决辦法、然後再由行政院加以討論、在未得到此種解决辦法之前、以不繼續討論爲宜、蓋公開討論徒亂人意、於事無濟也、惟三大國雖已同意如此辦理、而行政院其他會員亦必徵取同意、尤以羅馬尼亞外長蒂杜樓斯哥爲要、緣七日行政院第一次討論馬賽案時、蒂氏曾要求將匈牙利對南國申請書之復文、提出討論、予以反駁、並謂在反駁匈牙利復文以前、此次辯論不能結束也、行政院原定明日午前舉行會議、業已延至午後矣、此外賴伐爾又對各國代表說明、必須於最短期間覓得良善之解决辦法、如遷延不决、則人心失望、關係方面將以國聯會爲不可恃、而自求解决之道、如是則大亂起矣、目下安危繫於一髮、策略上稍有不愼、或一時之疏解、皆足破壞歐洲之和平、吾人於此不能不千萬審愼云云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）昨日聯會行政院舉行會議之時、法外長賴伐爾曾發表演說、大意分爲三點、（一）匈牙利若干官廳牽涉馬賽兇案、應使其負責、（二）請匈牙利政府重行正式調查、（三）從速研究一種公約草案、將「各國容留政治犯之權利」予以規定、現已根據此意、草擬决議案、夜深時、聞國際方面人士言、南斯拉夫代表團對於此項决議草案或有接受之可能、惟不幸意大利及匈牙利兩國代表團反對此案、聞明日將繼續進行談話、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>國聯討論懲處恐怖公約</h3>
<p>罪犯交國際法庭審理</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會行政院本日午後開會、繼續討論南斯拉夫與匈牙利之爭端時、主席葡萄牙代表華斯貢賽洛斯將宣讀法國政府備忘錄、名爲「締結國際公約、以懲處一切政治的恐怖主義犯罪行爲之基礎」、凡屬謀害國家元首·政府首領·政治會議會員、及企圖破壞鐵道、公共建築·及船舶之恐怖行動、必須加以懲處、並規定凡屬圖謀或宣傳此種恐怖行動之團體亦在懲處之列、此項公約、當依然一九二九年懲處僞造貨幣之國際公約所定辦法、將違犯者提付國際刑事法院審理之、此項法院、共設推事五人、遇有違犯公約情事時、始行開庭、此外公約內並規定罪犯引渡制度·保證護照·及身份證明書之正確可靠、與夫簽約國發覺準備犯罪行動、謀在外國領土行施者、應卽將其所得消息詳細通知有關國家、國際聯合會並須建議各會員國在引渡條約中、允將政治的暗殺罪包括在內、蓋以現行各種引渡條約、對於政治的暗殺罪犯不許引渡故也、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫不致退出國聯</h3>
<p>但將撤回駐匈公使</p>
<p>（日內瓦）南斯拉夫外長葉夫的區今日與國聯行政院人士私人談話、聲稱、如匈牙利不因馬賽慘案而受懲戒、則南斯拉夫或將不得已而退出國聯云（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）路透訪員今日探悉、外傳南斯拉夫向國聯提出之要求、如不能償願、則擬退出國聯之說、毫無根據、惟南國殊重視南匈間之爭案、已聲明其至小之要求、並宣布如此項要求、不能遂意、則擬撤回向國聯提出之請願、而另取其他途徑以償其願、其意蓋謂將與匈國斷絶外交與經濟關係、停止邊界之交通、甚至將撤回駐匈京之公使也、（十日路透電）</p>
<h3>歐戰退伍軍人促進法意妥恊</h3>
<p>法國海軍部長參加大會</p>
<p>熱諾亞意法兩國歐戰參戰軍人在此間舉行友誼性質之集會、法國海軍部長庇特利特來參加、法國駐意大使尙伯蘭及兩國要人亦皆列席、先由意國盲目衆議員德爾克羅瓦發表簡短演說、謂意法兩國間談判若克告成、則不僅兩國受惠、抑亦全世界之幸也云云、繼由庇特利演說、謂『意法兩國間以前容有誤會之處、現則已歸消散、法國之自由保守主義從此可與意國之民主主義和諧互存、則以兩國皆以民族爲神聖不可侵犯之目標、正與古代羅馬之以共和國幸福爲無上法律初無二致故也』、庇氏繼述及法國外長賴伐爾行將來意一事、謂渠爲海軍部長、而賴氏則爲外交當局、故法意携手之事、應由賴氏任之、庇氏嗣將法意兩國民族在古羅馬時代、及文藝復興時代及法國大革命時代所成事業予以申述、最後謂、『法國最初以爲汎繫主義僅係一種政治方式、而不知實係與意國民族性質相適應之社會更新方式也、』（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>法國名作家評論法德關係</h3>
<p>主張退伍軍人設聯合會</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國名作家羅曼氏在小日報發表一文、論及法國之外交新政策及德法之關係、謂目前緊張局勢之和緩實因法外長之更動所致、前外長巴爾都之政策靈敏而危險、致使全歐陰霾密佈、如彼尙在、則一切談判均感棘手、賴伐爾外長則頭腦冷靜、頗有可取云、羅曼氏對於退伍軍人之行動備極贊揚、謂彼等實爲改善德法關係、及解决薩爾問題之中堅、深盼兩國之退伍軍人能組織一聯合委員會、以維護兩國之安寗云云、（十日國民電）</p>

<h3>南次郎繼菱刈任關東軍司令</h3>
<p>兼駐僞國大使</p>

<p>（東京）今晨十時、南大將與岡田首相晋宮、岡田侍立、日皇任南大將爲關東軍司令官·駐滿大使·兼關東廳長官、日軍部稱此次之調動、係定期之更動、惟衆信因駐滿日警同盟辭職反對改革駐滿機關所致、南大將爲九一八變當時之陸相、滿變之元兇、今次接任此職、爲各方面所特别注意者、爲岡田內閣成立當時、海軍艦隊派迫政府宣布廢海約、南大將與此派合作、棄其調和派之舊衣裳、竟被擬爲繼任首相、致爲元老重臣所忌、今次出任司令官、似爲榮轉、實爲敬遠云、（十日華聯社電）</p>

<p>（東京）政友會定於十日舉行議員大會、恊議統制黨部問題、並决定方針、將於普通議會傾其全力以免重演臨時議會之失敗、政友會表面雖呈平靜狀態、然其內面有極複雜之內訌、卽臨時議會開會以前、因進行政民提携運動未見大破綻、然議會中幹部提出緊急動議之方法、極爲拙劣、從來與鈴木派不卽不離態度之舊政友會派、完全與鈴木派離開其感情之不合、遂使床次派乘機活動、現在最堪注目者爲久原派之舉動、久原自政民聯合說發生後、逐漸擴大其勢力、認今次動議問題、爲鳩山派欲打倒久原勢力之策謀、因此兩派感情愈形惡化、政友會鈴木派、久原派、舊政友派·三者對立、統一問題能否實現、頗屬疑問、（三日日聯電）</p>

<p>昨日大霧迷天昨日清晨一時許起、本埠天際及吳淞口外東海沿岸、突起濃厚之重霧、爲本埠方面最近十數年來所未有、按該項重霧所含濕度殊高、並帶有極窒息之氣味、使人呼吸頗感不適、記者於昨晨七時許、特僱小輪視察黃浦江面、自楊樹浦以北、霧重更爲驚人、五步以外、已不辨人物、</p>
<p>輪船飛機被阻昨日清晨、因江面及吳淞口外烟霧瀰漫之故輪船飛機、均爲之阻、據海關方面報告、前晚應出口而因霧中止者、計有招商局之江大、及行駛粵汕綫之海上輪等多艘、進口船計有世界班大來公司格蘭脫總統號·招商局建國輪·太古公司新銘·美最時洋行脫勒武號·及滬甬班之新甬興·新江天·等輪、均因霧爲避免不測計、多停留吳淞口外抛錨、至中午十一時後、俟霧幕稍薄始陸續進口、又昨日廣東路中國航空公司滬漢綫第六號飛機、每日均定爲上午七時由滬飛漢、乃因重霧關係、延至上午十一時二十分、始克起飛、其餘滬平·渝蓉·漢渝·滬粵·等航綫飛機悉由外埠飛回上海方面、聞該公司未接到電報、當不致受到霧氣阻碍、又據仁記路歐亞航空公司發言人云、本公司今日無班期、故未受到影響、</p>

<p>海面大霧昨日海面有大霧、自早晨八時起、至下午二時止、霧露之重、爲近所罕見、海面航道、盡被阻蔽、而咫尺之間、亦不能見、故進口之南北洋輪、均在銅沙相近抛泊、而出口海輪、在第二號河筒處停泊、總計在兩處抛停避霧之輪、有三十餘艘、海面交通、頓爲之斷、直至下午二時之後、方始霧散進口</p>
<p>華安肇禍本埠常安公司之華安號輪、此次由福州來滬、昨日駛到吳淞口外、亦遇大霧、下午一時許、有大帆船一艘、滿裝貨物、從上海開出、行至吳淞口外、約一海里半、卽第二號河筒處、在大霧中、因彼此不能看清、致與華安輪相撞、當時該帆船爲華安猛撞之下、立時船體粉碎、便卽下沉、全船貨件與船內舟子、均皆落海、發生極大之慘禍、</p>
<p>停輪助救出車時、華安輪立卽停船、恊助救護、該帆船一撞之下、僅留船尾一截、其餘則已完全碎没海內、未漂流之帆船尾、當時繫在華安船尾、一面卽解放舢板、下海代爲撈救舟子、該帆船內死亡若干人、救出若干人、因華安到滬較遲、尙未據船主報告、須待本日、方可詳悉、</p>
<p>小船撈物此慘劇發生時、昨日被霧阻遲之進口各海輪、均皆目覩在霧散之後、吳淞外海面滿漂該帆船沉失之物件、一般小船、在海面上爭相撈取、該帆船載重極巨、船內貨物甚多、故此次之損害極大、所有溺斃人數若干、記者先到該公司詢問、尙未得到報告、次至大通碼頭、因輪泊河心、亦未獲詳悉、統俟本日查明續告、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第五回　諂笑逢迎挑燈　憔悴　踢驅迨粉　　風流</p>
<p>他說了這話，扭轉身軀，就有向回家路上走去的樣子。月英如何不知道這事嚴重，假使舅　反了臉，不讓自家三代人在他家裏住，那麽，立刻就要出門討飯。不但是討飯，上面兩代人會急死，因爲由甘肅到西安來，是有指望的，所以逃命的逃了來，現在没有了指望，可回去不了。當時，就轉了那黑白分明的眼珠，嘻嘻的向胡嫂子笑着，胡嫂子是作了個生氣的樣子，扭轉身子去，所以月英對他笑，他並没有看見。然而胡嫂子没有看見，却另外有個人恰好是看見，和月英打了個照面。月英這嘻嘻一笑，不啻是對他笑了，這就呌月英太難爲情，臊得滿臉通紅，把頭低了。這人是個二十附近的青年，穿了一身深藍色的布衣褲，頭上也戴一頂藍布軍帽，分明是個學生。因爲在他脇下，他還夾着一個大書包呢。在這一刹那之間，月英没有看清楚他是怎麽個樣子，不過看到他圓圓的臉，大大的眼睛，那黑眼珠子覺得有道亮光射人，是個有精神的樣子。那學生到這小西天來，本就換過了一個環境，對於小西天這樣的時髦姑娘，根本就不想去看。不過人家已是對他嘻嘻一笑，這不能是偶然的，必有所謂，因之站住了脚，看看自己身上，又看看月英。這時，胡嫂子回轉過頭來了，月英就笑向他道：剛才是我的不是。我不應當那個樣子的。現在只請你帶我去，你怎麽好　胡嫂子道：這可是你自己願意去的。月英道：本來就是我自己願意去的。胡嫂子微笑道：哼！你也想明白了，走罷。（八七）</p>
<h3>雙仙童</h3>
<p>— 望雲</p>
<p>近日的世界，眞是五花八門的世界。一方面，科學上的新發明，旣然可以使人們飽享許多前人所未享的幸福，一方面，重興國術，又把「七俠五義」「小五義」「續小五義」中驚人本領，一一使其實現。最近的消息，粵港報紙上喧傳的「雙仙童」設館台山縣，大有武俠小說的意味，吾不得不介紹於一般讀者：</p>
<p>「雙仙童」並不是兩個仙童，只是一個少年僧侶，不過他的别號呌做雙仙童罷了。從前，台山城外曾邊村地方，有村人曾某，生有七子。其妻因食指繁多，生活上有相當的痛苦，便把年才二齡的第七子，送與少林寺僧人「半天飛」爲徒。該僧挈帶曾兒返山，敎練技術，替他取一别號，呌做雙仙童，計自上山以來，直至今茲，已經歷了二十二寒暑，直至今夏，才奉了師命，下山雲遊訪友。</p>
<p>在兩月前，隻身來廣州，寄居於少林派拳師陳斗家中，後來，訪問台山縣設有國技研究館，不禁見獵心喜，且台山又係桑梓之鄉，因於數日前來台，訪問研究會常務董事李燦元。恰値李氏因事赴廣州，不得握晤。會中諸人，因係雲遊僧侶，不敢招待，雙仙童遂另覓宿處，守候李君回台。越數日，李君已由廣州回來，雙仙童又登門求見。李君聽他自述經過，不甚相信，遂令雙仙童表演技能。一經表演以後，該僧確係深得少林武當各技的精華，而且，運氣，輕身，步行水面，壁虎遊牆諸本領，尤使作壁上觀者個個咋舌。李常務以如此人材，得未曾有，挽留雙仙童設館授徒，以傳絶學，雙仙童亦很願替桑梓服務，慨然承諾。該僧年二十四，每餐止食飯半碗，天眞爛熳，宛如小孩，待人接物，尤彬彬有禮云。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （夏涔鵑）</p>
<p>兒子看親生的爸爸媽媽結婚，又看爸爸媽媽離婚，這是一椿絶對没有的奇事。可是在現代居然有之，而且並不算是奇事，因為爸爸媽媽先行交易，生下兒子來，然後擇吉開張，這豈非兒子看爸爸媽媽結婚嗎？隔了幾年，爸爸媽媽意見不合，請律師，打官司，各自東西，這豈非兒子看爸爸媽媽離婚嗎？</p>
<h3>大學生與跳舞</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>日本自從禁止大學生踏進舞塲之後，舞塲生涯，一落千丈，舞女生活，頗有難以支持之勢。但是我們的上海，現在也禁止大學生在舞塲裏摟抱女人了。在這一個新政策之下，我們的舞塲營業，以及舞女生活，將受怎樣的影響，我想，這也許是讀者諸君，所急欲知道的吧。</p>
<p>昨天，遇到一位在舞塲裏當賬房的朋友。他說，這種禁令，對於上海的舞塲的影響，並不大，原因是上海的在水平綫上的舞塲的營業，不是建築在大學生的錢袋上面的。洋務人員，公務人員，大學中學的敎授，以及上海人的所謂小開之輩，才是一般舞塲的衣食父母。至於大學生們進舞塲的，在上海，本就是佔着一個很小的指數。在這很小的指數中，十之六七，都是帶着舞伴進塲的。十之二三，都是上小舞廳，每元可跳六七次的所在去的　。在正式的舞塲裏，肯花錢買了舞票給舞女的，已是很少。至於開香賓，坐檯子，更就非所敢望於大學生的。所以自從禁止大學生跳舞之後，全上海除了二三家小舞塲，略受影響之外，對於整個舞界，可就没有那麽一回事呢。</p>
<p>從這上面瞧來，我們上海的大學生，或許比了日本的大學生，還高出一籌。</p>
<h3>中國教育途上的追求者</h3>
<h3>記徐靜雲魔術師</h3>
<p>— 李弢安</p>
<p>魔術雖小道，其寓有物理化學等一般應用科學之效能於遊戲三昧間，則爲大衆所一致公認。按之魔術表演，其類别有三；大略分團體表演，非職業表演，與舞台表演三種，就中以舞台表演爲最難能可貴，蓋魔術表演苟非新奇特異者，勢必不能久享厥名而爲自然所遺棄與淘汰，如世界魔術師聯合會會長杜賓氏曁副會長亨利氏皆爲當世榮受盛名者，丹麥之著名大帽子鄧脫氏亦爲其中之一·至今猶爲人稱道弗衰，亨利，鄧脫兩氏不久均曾來華遊歷。過滬上時其往晋謁獲蒙接談者僅吾友徐靜雲曁其他研究魔術學家兩三人，靜雲，年青而富思想，擅攝影，游泳之技，游泳更有雄名，嘗一度獲上海青年會會友個人錦標，其善魔術初不肯以之問世，嗣因受友好慫恿，始毅然允在新光登台，連日觀衆滿座，足見其魔力之偉大，不同凡響也。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>從表面上看，這一座大殿中所陳列的東西是咸豐皇帝的遺物，然而從精神上看，也儘可說是這些都是屬於太后自己的東西！因爲咸豐的每一件遺物，和太后無不各有相當的關係，而且都曾沾染過伊的手澤！所以這些遺物，實在是伊和咸豐所共有的！伊見了伊自己的東西，怎能不發生一種特别的感覺呢？但伊並没有什麽動作，儘把伊的臉板得像泥彫木塑一般的呆着；這時候卽使有一個著名的丑角，在伊面前表演，我想伊也决不會笑的！</p>
<p>最後，伊終於慢慢地旋過來了，臉向着我們，但依舊是一些没有表情，態度非常不自然。伊開始說話了。據我推測，伊多分是自動的感覺到了不能不向我們作一番說明的需要，伊想給我們說明爲什麽咸豐的遺物在這裏是收藏得特别的少？其實伊也未必不知道我們已經見到了其中的眞相；可是伊爲盡伊做一個愛妻的責任起見，總不能不故意迴護伊的丈夫。於是伊就用很懇切的語氣，盡力責的替那昏庸的咸豐掩飾一切，希望大家能够對他諒解。</p>
<p>「你們要知道！」伊的聲音很低。「咸豐皇上可不是一個藝術家，他並没有什麽嗜好，也不歡喜收藏任何一種玩物；就是日常用的東西，也向不講究。說得清楚一些，他是一個傾向自然的人！他只愛生命，從不顧惜一切没有活力的淫工巧藝！什麽書畫，玉石，金銀，古玩，對於他是一槪没有緣分的！然而他畢竟不失爲一個富有才力的統治者！」（一九六）</p>
<p>短篇小説</p>
<h3>老屋</h3>
<p>— 趙更堤</p>
<p>在叟目漱石的「哥兒」裏，曾叙述過哥兒怎樣費了那麽多的氣力，那麽多的精神，終究辨别不了一切人對自己的善和惡。這在年青的都市人，也許會有同樣的感覺。在只能造成些强姦，略誘，綁票，竊盜等法律名辭的生活圈裏，要找尋意義，辨别善惡，怕會比哥兒更難。</p>
<p>而另一面，中國的古詩裏，有騎着瘦驢，踏着積雪，跟着小童，提着錦囊，一個行吟的賀長吉。在泰戈爾的詩句裏，可以想見有白髮的老者，拖了長衣，划着小船，在飄拂的楊柳蔭裏，慢慢淌過了如鏡的小溪，在自己幼年的記憶裏，在暖和的陽光下，緊倚在老祖父的胸前，望着草地裏熟睡的小牛，遠處有些繚繞的炊烟。這兒不用找尋意義，也不必辨到善惡。但那些詩樣的田園味，像隔夜的夢，在記憶的角裏，留下些不可捉摸的痕跡。</p>
<p>爲了些瑣碎的所謂人事，踏上了幾年來陌生　的歸途。這遼廓的大自然，收受了飄泊他鄉的孩子。在青色的菜園裏，有着花布抹額的村女，拾起驚奇的眼，望這遠來的行路人。四野裹滿是黃澄澄的稻穗，給微風吹拂着，起了輕淡的波浪。</p>
<p>家，一向不願掛在嘴上，也不願記在心裏的，現在正橫在眼前，也許爲了看慣了矗立的摩天大厦，也許爲了自己體格的長大，這老屋比過去低了些，也老了些。這裏曾度了自己無猜的童年，留下了，我的久别的母親。僥倖的伊不像想像中的衰老，然而這是太落寞了，太冷靜了，不該稽留在被視爲樂土的都市裏，讓晚年的老母，度着凄凉的時日。對這傴僂纖弱的背影，感到莫明的惶惑。</p>
<p>呌人搬個籐椅，在滿是斜陽的天井裏，坐了下來，踏在滑膩的青苔上，一時没有思索，在情緒的眞空裏，屋檐下一個蜘蛛，正在結網，那網牽住了前後兩埭的屋角，風來時，蛛蜘稍微蕩動一下，仍舊曲折地前進，恰好象徵了無爭而紆緩的鄉村生活。假使自己還是過去一樣年幼，這蛛網，早綣上了蘆頭梢的竹圈，但現在對這些固然没有興致；而以一個成年人，再來玩這套把戲，似乎也過意不去。只懶懶地倚着奇靠。母親從裏面出來。</p>
<p>「爲什麽這樣呆着？覺得無聊麽？外面風正好，後塲上有孩子們放風箏，玩一下也罷。」</p>
<p>媽以爲這還是十年前的孩子。伊不知道自己一向在呆想裏過生活。是的，這些伊不該知道，媽的女兒，會靠了上帝的福，永遠是幸運的，快樂的。拖着倦怠的身子，踏着緩慢的脚步，向後塲去。母親是應當感謝的。</p>
<p>夜來了，在蒙塵的老屋裏，顯得蒼茫的。母親燃上一支烟，靠在榻上，也許每一個黃昏，伊是這樣消遣了的。呌我坐在對面的籐椅裏。</p>
<p>「我知道你一向身體不怎樣好在外面有些不舒服，該早些請醫生，媽離得這樣遠，是不能照顧的。再說你爲什麽這樣長久不回來，住在别人家，終是不關痛癢的。我也老了，時常有病，家裏一切，也該你來整理，你又没個弟兄。」媽這樣說。</p>
<p>一向在冰冷的生活裏，滯呆了的心，扇動了溫熱的微波，没法把眼淚倒流下去，讓它滴在母親的衫袖裏，裙角上。</p>
<p>燈影更昏黃，身上有些寒冷。一隻花貓，在這陌生的歸客身上，呼呼地熱睡，無趣得很，夜眞的深，也眞的靜。隔河古廟裏，傳來了斷續的木魚聲，這怕是爲人類的紛爭，祈求懺悔的聲音。望着這塵泥剥蝕的古屋，倦眼矇朧的老母，我祝禱這一切的長存。</p>

<h3>永生在人們心裏的作品</h3>
<p>— 孤西</p>
<p>「給初學寫作者的一封信」讀後感</p>
<p>應該寫那綽有餘力能從廣大的讀者羣中永恒持續着它的生命的作品，這是說：寫出來的作品要使它能够永生在人們的心裏！</p>
<p>一個作家，絶不要寫那旣浪費自己又浪費人的東西；至於那甚或足以傷害自己又傷害讀者的，則更不應該寫－頂要緊的是：在每一回着手寫作之初，至少，應該先思索，悟解他要寫的是否曾使本人受其强烈的感動與深邃的啟示的東西；和是否具備着良好的重大的社會意義。因爲文學，正如武者小路實篤說的那樣：「是靠著將自己精神裏面有些什麽東西，表示出來，而在别人的精神裏面，尋出自己的知己的運動之一。」所以必須是曾經燃燒着自己的心，搖撼着自己的靈魂而使自己受其感動並融會了自己的東西，再把它從自己的底裏生發了出來，才能同樣地去燃燒讀者的心，搖撼讀者的靈魂而使他們受同樣强烈的激動。這樣，你的作品才能够找到億兆衆廣大的讀者，而在他們的心生永生着！</p>
<p>要寫一部能獲得廣大的讀者而且得永生在他們心裏作品，這不是一椿輕易的事。除非它確是蒸溜着作者充實的全生活者，恐怕是難乎及此的吧！單單說寫作要像蒸溜什麽似的來「蒸溜」，已經不是容易的了；可是最重要的，還在乎要有東西可以來供給「蒸溜」這一點，於是，充實的生活經騐，對於作者就成爲最可貴的了！</p>
<p>每一個作者，都應該努力使自己成爲一個有着深邃的敎養和廣大的眼界的充實生活的實地經騐者。不如此，要想從一個生活經騐枯索的作者那裏求得偉大作品，其難就不啻如向荒旱的沙漠中去求甘泉了！</p>
<p>蘇聯文學顧問會在給初學寫作者的一封信裏，告訴我們高爾基的創作之所以在通俗上，在影響上，在社會意味上，没有與他相匹敵者，「是因爲他不特具有權威的描寫天才，而且對於所寫的東西異常的熟悉，換言之，是因爲他的權威的描寫天才曾配合以特殊的那描寫的知識的緣故。」這「描寫的知識」，這「對於所寫的東西異常的熟悉」的一點，實在是頂頂要緊的！</p>
<p>那麽，什麽才可以使我們對於所要寫的東西熟悉起來，使我們得到廣博的「描寫的知識」呢？</p>
<p>爲省力地來解答起見，我想借引Ａ聶維洛夫寫在一篇小說中的話來說明。在「我要活」裏面，他寫主人公思索「爲什麽我們是不幸者，而别人却是幸福者」的問題到一天解悟了的時候，曾這樣的喊了出來，說：</p>
<p>「生活自己給了我回答並指敎了我，牠用毫不可破的眞實來開發我！」</p>
<p>我們也可以這樣說：</p>
<p>「生活自己使我們對於要寫的東西熟悉起來，它用最確切可靠的眞實來開發我們，使我們得到最大量的描寫的知識。</p>
<p>倘使不是塞拉菲摩維支親自參加了革命隊伍的話，像「鐵流」那樣偉大的作品怕永遠無從「蒸溜」出來的吧！要不是高爾基親自曾踱過來幾十年歷監了顚沛流離的實生活，那麽像「母親」，「我的大學」以及其他許多他所寫永生的作品，也許到此刻也還不會呌我們發現的吧！</p>
<p>「囂洛霍夫的已耕的處女地之所以能那樣眞實而巧妙地描出集體農塲建設情景者，是因囂氏很精密的很仔細研究了所描寫環境之故，法捷耶夫的毁滅，所以能够那樣深入大衆讀者者，是因爲法氏用融會貫通，受其感動，又極熟悉的材料寫小說之故」據說：剛查列夫爲了描寫一個奧布洛莫夫，是曾經從實生活上去了多年的觀察和工作的。由此，可知凡是偉大的作品，决不是可以僥倖得的。寫一部永生在人們的心裏的作品，决不是輕巧的事。必須將作家全部精神都集注在其中，作家克實的「全我」的結晶都在那裏顯現了出來的，這纔能成爲卓越，深刻；而顯得偉大！這工作固然來得不易，可是，我們非得向繁難，深邃處去努力不可！</p>
<p>懶怠，畏怯，苟安，永遠是不成的，爲什麽我們有志於寫作者不深入遼闊的生活中敎育自己，使自己成爲一個有正確的敎養與廣博的經騐者呢？</p>
<p>「求知於『天花板』，選材於『指頭』」，總是失敗的，爲什麽我們的作者要造作那隔膜於自己，甚或毫無所知於自己的東西呢？（只知西子湖的爲什麽要去寫西伯利亞呢？···）</p>
<p>每個寫作者都須確切，眞實的地去寫那曾使自己激動而且永恒活躍在自己面前的東西；祇有這樣將對於自己彷彿是有着最熱睦之感的東西巧妙地寫了出來時，這才容易成爲內容結實，力量强，印象深的偉大作品而得以深入到輕易所不能到的人們的心裏去永生着！</p>
<p>詩人白斯金曾唱着這樣的歌：</p>
<p>我的歌曲是以苦痛和眼淚，</p>
<p>無夢底夜的憂傷煉就的。······</p>
<p>我的歌曲充滿了哀喊，呻吟，酸心，</p>
<p>發出響聲於大地，······</p>
<p>牠以憂傷燃燒人們的心令幸福者感到悲戚；</p>
<p>那歌曲自己臨在人們的悲戚的上面</p>
<p>將無終止的發響而且哀啼！</p>
<p>如像那支「歌」，能够「自己臨在人們的悲戚的上面，無終止的發響而且哀啼」一般，讓我們所寫作的也逹到這一步境地吧！</p>
<h3>文藝雜筆</h3>
<p>— 再青</p>
<p>高爾基寫詩人亞歷山大勃洛克的回憶，說勃洛克在一個凄哀的深夜，曾經遇到一個街頭的妓女。他很憂鬱的把她抱在膝上，沉默的度過一夜。第二天，什麽都不曾說，傾其身邊所有的給了她，自己帶着沉重而陰鬱的心情，離開了那個地方。</p>
<p>讀法國畫家谷訶日記，不期的竟發現了類似的事情。說是畫家梵·谷訶在窮窘的時候，去找一個出版家，想問他借一點錢生活。這出版家是比較開明的，不是絶對庸俗的大。當他說過一套生意眼的話，加上「好吧，人們說你很有天才。來吧，這裏有一百個銅子兒」的結論以後，竟相當的「施與」了。</p>
<p>從這兩個故事裏，很可以使我們看到藝人的偉大性，一種不可及的博愛的情懷。但是，問題也就在這裏。勃洛克傾其所有了，那妓女是不是因他的一點錢，而就能自救了呢？這一天的夜晚，是不是如我們詩人所想像的，她就不再到街頭賣笑呢？事實上是不可能的。谷訶，當他在雨雪紛飛中，救了一個飢餓的老婦人，寗可自己挨着餓，這是他超特的地方，可是，就抛開他自己的飢餓不說，如果在不剩一錢的時候，又遇到第二個，甚至第三個這樣可憐的婦人，他又有什麽力量去帮助他們呢？可憐憫的，决不止於他所「施與」的老婦人一個。「安得廣厦千萬間，」縱然有此想，也不過是「畫餅」而已。</p>
<p>可憐的藝人，你們應該往大處想！</p>
<h3>大起恐慌</h3>
<p>— 丁泉</p>
<p>查學的要來，抽考的要來，敎育廳長也要來。學生慌了，敎員慌了，事務處慌了，工友也慌了。平日不燒香的學生而今也只得臨時抱一下佛腿了，白天游戲塲中見不到人影，一下了課，各人抱一本書跑到向陽的地方坐下來，眼釘在書本上一轉都不轉，敎室中留下的幾個也都低着頭在絞腦子。晚上用不到點名，没有一個托辭上茅厠，一進門看見先生趕快裝着提起袴子的。看吧，没一個交頭接耳的，没一個用呵欠表示嫌時光慢的，各人對着一本書像對着親密的朋友。下班鈴一響，大家呀的一聲恨時光太快，這時的學生眞可以說是惜分陰了。</p>
<p>要好是人情所同然，誰不願意有粉搽在當面呢。於是預備抽考預備會考的各種會議開過了，自然議决了一些辦法。誰不希望自己敎的那班顯臉呢，誰不高興自己敎的那門出色呢，於是各人大賣力氣，加鐘點，添講義，警告學生，勸導學生，而學生便警惕起來（本來這兒的學生就很用功）夜以繼日。本來熄燈以下不許再點燭的，而這幾夜就破了例，本來心中有事就無法睡寗，半夜裏的燭光便在寢室中閃耀着了。早晨天還没大亮，書聲便四起了。茅厮裏還有人咕嚕着拼英文。</p>
<p>敎員害怕着學生不能爭面子，而學生所怕的是不及格的功課多了，降班，開除！</p>
<p>學生問先生應該注意的地方，先生來一個提要，至少這一提把所學過的全提起來了，英文先生呌好好念英文，數學先生呌努力演算草，國文先生課外來上一篇國文呌學生習作（題目當然是揣其有出的可能性的）。</p>
<p>女生膽子更小，怕的程度也更大。她們心下想：一個人不及格開除一個，一班不及格開除一班，全校不及格連校長老師一齊開除！那多不好，大家便不能在一堆了，我們要努力，爭個人的光榮，爭一班的光榮，爭全校的光榮。</p>
<p>事務處也格外忙了，計劃這計劃那，工夫跑細了腿，一樁樁一件件的。門户上的玻璃發了亮，茅厠裏鋪了新土，地上連個樹葉找不到，一切都新鮮了。上下一齊努力着興奮着伺候着抽考的伺候着查學的伺候着敎育廳長！</p>
<p>至今還没伺候到一個，然而學生已有好些病在牀上的了！</p>
<h3>時代之輪</h3>
<p>— 前轍</p>
<p>在社會科學的講座上，很容易地會談到自然界諸現象底連鎖關係，有人說這就是一個「連環」。可是，一說到環字，又有人聯想到「循環」上面去。比方說，「三王之道若循環」，這是一班前輩先生所說慣的「口頭禪」。</p>
<p>要解釋「三王之道」，的確是不大容易的。因爲這個「道」字是多末的抽象，多末的神秘；眼看不見，手觸不到，要說起來却無從下手。前輩先生爲「删繁就簡」起見，於是舉出一個比喩來——「若循環」。</p>
<p>大槪什末是「循環」，總有許多人懂得吧，有秒着多費筆墨來解釋。如果一定要解釋的話，那末！請你看一看摩登的小姐們套着玉臂上的金釧，就可以領會到「循環」是怎末樣的東西了。說明白畫兒吧，「循環」是互相銜接的一個圓圓的圈兒——分不開那兒是頭，那兒是尾。</p>
<p>我又想到一個故事來——有位先生出了一個題目問學生說，ＡＢ兩個兎子，繞着一棵樹團團轉地互相追逐着，到底是Ａ追Ｂ呢，還是Ｂ追Ａ？這個的確把學生難到了；就是出題目主試的那位先生吧，也不見得有什末「八寶」會把它解决下來。</p>
<p>所謂「循環」，大槪就是這樣的，無頭無尾的。</p>
<p>可是，山於「循環」這兩個字，我們很容易地又會聯想到輪子。瞧馬路上的車輛，工廠里的機輪，轉着，轉着，不是一樣地「若循環」之無頭無尾嗎？有些聰明人，哲學家，把眼眶兒睜大了，看到整個時代都是動的，像輪子一般，更没有停止。於是，「時代之輪」這一個口號，很輕鬆地流傳開去，成爲一個嶄新的名辭。</p>
<p>喊過「三王之道若循環」的口號的前輩先生，誓不肯低頭，也來凑凑熱鬧，喊一句「時代之輪」。那末，這種前輩先生算是「前進」了吧，已經認識了時代是一天天在變動的了。</p>
<p>慢着，前輩先生儘管喊他底摩登的口號，其實，拿Ｘ光鏡來照一下，呵，這不過是借屍還魂的一個把戲吧。比方說，他們一輩子在提倡着什末古文囉，翻印着什末版的古書囉，在他們底腦子里，總可以說，是「時代之輪」的反映。換句話說，他們引出些什末煌煌的經典做證據，例如「雖百世，可知也」。爲什末呢？這都是「三王之道若循環」在作崇。</p>
<p>前輩先生以爲「循環」就好像輪子一般；雖然時代是不息地轉着，總是往復地打着圈兒。其實，輪子固然往復地轉着，可是，牠第二次轉的時候，已經和第一次的情形不同了。（第一次轉的時候，把原有的空氣迫走，新的空氣又補充了來）。况且，「時代之輪」並不是工廠里機輪那末固定的，倒像馬路上的車輪，打一個圈兒，已經移動了一個位置。</p>
<p>可以時代之輪，並不如前輩先生底時代觀那般機械的。</p>
<h3>明天（十三）</h3>
<p>— （Joseph　Cornad）著吳向隅譯</p>
<p>他吸了一口氣，他於是很幽默地說：「哎，把門關了起來。我並不在意，如果······你想起來能恢復轉來認識我······唔；什麽？······你能辦到？在一星期內，你說？哼，我敢說你能够－但你想我能够在這死呆活氣的地方留一星期麽？决不是我！我要末去做苦工，要末趕熱鬧，要末有一個比整個英國還要大的地方讓我去流浪。以前雖然有一次我曾在這地方，並且住了一星期以上。那時老頭子曾登廣告找尋我，一個同我在一起的伙伴忽起了想從他那兒得着兩鎊錢」的意思，在一封信內寫了些胡話。可是那個把戲没有實現出來。我們兩人不得不離開——没有一個人很怱忙的。但是這一次我却有一個伙伴在倫敦等我，此外······」</p>
<p>貝姗嘉維爾又在很急促地呼吸着。</p>
<p>「我去敲門怎樣呢？」他提議。</p>
<p>「試試看，」他說。</p>
<p>海格波特船長的大門吱吱的響了，他的兒子的影子移向前去，隨後，他停止下來，喉嚨中她的耳朶靈敏。</p>
<p>「他是不大活潑的－他是不是？我抓牢他，我很担心。許多傢伙却時常告訴我，說我不曉，我自己的氣力。」</p>
<p>「他是活人當中最不傷害人家的一個，」她插進來說。</p>
<p>「如果你曾經看到他用一條硬皮帶在樓上追我打的話，你就不這樣說了，」他說，「我過了十六年，還没有忘記這件事。」</p>
<p>另外一個溫柔的抑止的笑聲，又使她混身發熱。那位敲門人在噠噠的聲音，他更十分緊張起來。</p>

<p>新豐洋行報告、近期內股市而繼續有力、似將呈高度選擇之狀態、一以各股發給股息之希望爲依歸、非俟春季商業有實質之進步、投機性之股票恐仍難免於落後、故基於目下一般人對股息着重之槪念、宜乘機換購公司大部份贏利派作股息之股票、聯合坦克車即屬此類、不仿購置、財部此次發行新公債、認購過數超額定數倍、債劵投資背景因而愈見鞏固、以利率之低、游資之充斥、及贏利保障之進步、故債劵價格當能堅强、優等與中等債劵仍不失爲穩健者投資之對象、逆料此後數星期內政府對其政策當有重要之表白、而目下之疑雲與不安定狀態不難隨之而消滅、商界對明年國會中之急烈份子雖抱憂慮、然商業之進步、仍繼續不懈、道瓊斯紐約指數如左、</p>

<h3>紗花現紗銷數突增</h3>
<p>—標凖爲之帶起—</p>
<p>紗市晨初形狀平疲、因海外棉市軟化、復以豫省對於十七支紗大舉購買、南方亦活動採辦、人心突昂、市呈向榮、但新買者依然缺乏、年關將届、交易未暢、惟通成公司上月收進之紗、絡續售去計二十支富貴人鐘金城等紗有一千二三百包之譜</p>
<p>金雞漲五六七角標紗前市開盤、以外棉平澹、市氣稍懈、塲中買户不多各月跌二三角、拍至三收盤、聞現紗消息良好、市狀突然趨漲、結果各月均漲一二四角、午後因鄭州河南雲南廣東長沙等處對於現紗起而採辦、人心愈振、買風又起、賡豐抵空三千五百五十包、市塲籌碼較枯、市價尤漲、各月均漲四五角、查賣出大豐五百五十包、逹記五百包、昶記一千五百五十包、愼昌六百包、長豐二千一百五十包、潤康一千八百包、恒德一千包、頤大一千包、信誠九百包、買進大孚七百五十包、裕大八百包、大豐七百五十包、愼記一千包、賡豐三千五百五十包、遠大五百包、長餘六百包、潤康六百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>標花收前補空活動</h3>
<p>棉市始跌後漲、現棉情形平澹、美棉第六届估計發表產額爲九、七三一○○○包、較上届增加九七、○○○包、價微漲一至二磅音、印棉跌一羅比七五、而金價趨跌、致人心不振、但後以紗市轉漲、棉市帶起午後有一部份預料美棉趨漲、買氣加濃而漲云、</p>
<p>鄭標好兩三角標棉前市開盤、美棉產額又增、印棉回跌、金價下落、塲中情形較軟、買户萎縮、各月跌一二角、拍至三收盤、市氣突緊、以紗市趨漲、棉市隨之帶起、結果各月反漲一二角、午後開盤以金價下跌而疲、但担至二三盤、市價愈拍愈緊、因賡豐愼昌兩號大批抵空、以致抬面緊俏、故各月漲五分一角半二角、查賣出源大四千八百担、振大一千五百担、元德二千三百担、同興一千四百担、潤康一千担、錦昌二千担、益昶二千六百担、買進賡豐七千一百担、大孚一千担、通記二千一百担、均昶一千六百担、長餘一千七百担、愼昌六千一百担、潤康一千担、生源一千五百担、益豐一千担、一日間最高低價收盤價如下、</p>

<p>原棉做開無多現棉銷塲依然寥寥、廠方以花紗比價不符、對原棉無急急購辦之舉、來源計姚花七百八十包、通花九百包、</p>

<h3>糧食期粉囤户之活動力</h3>
<p>昨粉市上午開市後、洋麥漲跌不一、惟現貨因澳洲報價至五元以上、市上人心甚佳、囤户更活、且營口粉價傳說大至三元、故該帮昨日收補甚力、各廠均不放　出、福新反有抵補、因此引起浮户翻空爲多、囤户胃口尤活各月份乃紛紛上升、收回價本月大二分七五、下月二月各大三分二五、四月大四分半、三月大四分、五月大四分七五、</p>
<h3>期麥買氣亦殊濃</h3>
<p>昨洋麥期貨、出入不一、現洋麥報大至五元以上、本麥現貨、因此更爲貨主所居奇、期麥被洋麥與本麥所帶好、開價即漲、後粉市上升、買氣更旺、收市本月大五分、下月大七分、二月大九分、三月大七分、現麥漲七八分、開出八千包、爲福新阜豐信大申大分去、高車麥四元○七分、四元○四五分、四元不等、中次至三元八角五六分云、</p>
<h3>大宗暹米今明可到</h3>
<p>—現洋米見跌碎米反漲—</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、期貨爲本街內地爭辦、兼有浙帮與贛帮問訊、市氣甚佳、雖洋商續出、囤户回籠、而行情反漲五分、現貨西貢與暹邏機米均有定貨裝出在途、因此現洋米立小數分、惟碎洋米爲內地本街以及賑災去路所爭辦、連日飛升、昨日又漲一二角、尤以暹邏碎米爲更俏、客秈到銷兩活、砶米及紅米爲本客歡迎、而到存均稀、昨乃又漲近角、其他均居平固之局云、</p>
<p>本市米商、前在暹邏定購米石、由顧馨一向招商局賃租公平輪、三北公司龍山輪、赴暹邏裝儎等情、已誌前報、昨據招商局接公平輪電告、謂業由暹邏返滬、約今午可抵申、但近日海面大霧、航行不便、或延遲一天、亦未可知、計裝米三萬餘包、到滬後是否卸入金利源棧房、或浦東華棧、現尙未定、</p>
<h3>河下米價再小一角</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來原共到三十號、貨共四千五六百石、市况下垂、逐有跌風、惟每經一跌、去路反能動動、青島帮包胃續辦一千餘包、本街亦頗栗落、價格如厚粳及晚稻等俱跌一角左右、杜洋尖仍定、陰變元到源見稀、亦能稍轉平平、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下內地各帮到船仍少、約十三四號、河存近百艘、市上各色銷路、白粳羊尖杜尖早薄稻零　仍屬平淡、白元陰元亦呆、埠客尖尙佳、市形白粳價小一角左右、早薄稻羊杜尖埠客尖平疲、白元陰元價小數分、</p>
<h3>黃豆漲勢未衰</h3>
<p>中關貨尤爲提足</p>
<p>昨日黃豆承上週之餘風、趨勢仍頗　、皖省免徵五升捐、年內勢難實行、故津浦關海兩路大批來源須延時日、惟海州一帶之豆能輪運者、爲數亦稀、每日統計千餘包、去路則內地廠家辦冒不懈、市氣穩固、大連市面雖漲、但本市不受若何影響、因該豆祗銷出品及園坊之胃、近來該兩帮胃勢清淡、所以四平街豆仍在四元范家屯大粒亦祇開四元二角半、行情尙未跟大連而狂漲也、昨穎州陳豆開兩庫、價爲三元六角七、由通州車坊辦去、歸德新豆成交九百餘包、價爲三元六角及三元五角八分、去路爲廠家內地、郯城豆三百餘包、價爲三元六角、由本街採去新安鎭豆七百包、價扯三元五角、爲內地之胃、漢口車豆開八百包、價爲三元五角半及五角三亦爲內地問津、漢口乍豆成交二千餘包、價自三元三角半至三角二、由本街內地分去、行情比上週六續漲三四分、且中關豆比高貨爲提足云、</p>
<h3>糖市新潮青尙難低小</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、以關金見緊、趨勢尙穩、公　劃盤、二四粗砂白現貨普通十八元半、不動、本棧貨十八元六角、轉口貨五元二角、荷赤略緊、八九號高貨升三分、爲十四元三角三分、普通呌十四元、轉口貨四元九角、本廠綿白振裕一號、零星略有開出、仍爲十七元七角、四號十七元二角、太古糖Ｂ嘜呌十九元六角、國產片青因前貨已罄、到數軋缺、昨開小箱片青二百二十二箱、又中箱片青一百零七箱、均爲十元八角、比升三四角、新潮青昨富陞輪到千餘包、大約今明日可以見樣、開盤行方以到貨漸增、希望降價、但查地價近雖見跌、無如汕頭匯水大縮、僅九百六十五元劃申之價、仍難過小、號方爲成本關係、暫時不肯賤卸、因此軟中帶硬、後市有趨定之象、</p>
<h3>南北貨木耳地價進銳退速</h3>
<p>龍口粉又升四角</p>
<p>木耳上週初、漢市曾漲五六元、不料一週復始辦價突跌、昨據漢口電訊、興安河口貨降至八十一元六角、高堰耳八十二元六角、比上週初降去四五元、因此申市隨疲、鼎盛頂上航空牌小包耳昨呌九十五元、亦降三四元、後市恐防續鬆龍口綫粉乾、因地價步緊、申市銷路雖未大動、但售盤亦見逐升、昨市南規售二十一元、北規呌二十二元、又據龍口電訊、每包已升至二十八元二角、比前再漲四角、此後冬銷將旺、而地頭因天寒關係、不能續製、存底自必愈銷愈稀、更無轉鬆之可能</p>
<h3>油市嘉興歉收漢市鬧缺柏油新貨售盤飛漲</h3>
<p>柏油產新、向以鄂西荆州枝江等處爲最遲、故新油抵漢、總在冬至之後、惟麻城油離漢較近、到漢稍早、然身骨較軟、不合燭淘用場、所以本埠造燭坊家、在初見新油之後、全賴浙油供給尤以浙西嘉興一帶之本車柏油、爲最合宜、蓋地旣毘連、又能車運、早發夕至、因此往年小雪之後、浙路禾本已有數千件可到、旣有此巨大供給、當然不注意於漢油、無如今庚嘉興一隅年令大歉、統計祗有二三成可收、若以上年而計、冬令有三萬件禾本柏油可產、而今冬預算祗有七千件可出、與上冬比較僅二成稍零、祗顧就地銷場、猶虞不敷、自不能運銷滬上矣、且聞有向漢滬辦荆油運浙銷售、以抵禾本之不足、而滬上行淘不得不向漢採辦應用、乃漢市本在新陳交替時代、新油旣未有到、陳油存數已薄、突然被滬蘇杭嘉等各帮搶辦、大有奇峯突起之勢、求旣過供、市即飛漲、重荆油由九兩八錢一躍至十一兩四五錢、麻城油由九兩六錢加至十兩零八錢、且尙無現貨、所辦均是路貨、經此一番動作、存積完全售罄、而本埠行家所存亦無幾、聞漢市旣無現貨可辦、售盤亦不得不飛提、現市行家售重荆每砠十九元、平荆十八元四角、麻城油市秤十七元、據嘉興本車合到申市須在二十一元左右、所以不合遠甚矣、</p>
<h3>五金本廠元釘開價暗鬆</h3>
<p>本廠元釘、近因東西貨來源斷檔後、出路大爲興奮、交易異常可觀、長江一帶、內河諸帮以及閩浙去化甚佳、而北方面生意因以東貨之抵觸、故去化較弱、其餘各處之實用者、莫不以此爲唯一繁銷品、是以本埠本廠釘生意頗爲良好、但開價因釘廠設立太多、（現在開工出品者有七信八家之多）因此售價互相放低、是以標凖迭鬆、而最近暗盤益軟聞大市每桶開五元七角半、而暗盤祗開五元六角、（但限於大宗交易）比上春開價、跌落逹一元二角之多、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談「附會」與「剽竊」</h3>
<p>— 淡然</p>
<p>中國人是最會『附會』的民族，煮酒的不找出杜康元帥，做木匠的不找出魯班仙師來作他們的始祖，似乎没有他們的『一脈師承』可以炫耀，便不安心工作一樣，這是一例。今天有人發起破除迷信大會，我可以有一大吊子的話搬到演說臺上去，明天有人舉行和平祈禱會，我仍舊可以『頭頭是道』地大講一頓。這又是一例。不過這還是普通社會的現象，一般人也就恬不爲怪了，我們只要稍微注意一下，那麽就會無往而不可笑了，我還可以指出一件可笑的現象而要爲一般人所忽略的便是文人的『附會』了。</p>
<p>文人爲了經不起『名』心的驅使，自不得不找些方法來出出風頭。但是我們貴民族是特别好古的民族，好古的人自然看不起「今」，自然要向「古」裏去『敏以求之』。於是便要多方『附會』，便要設法找他們的『一脈師承了』，如果要指出實例，我可以介紹你到雜誌公司去翻十分鐘，假若你在那裏找不到實例的話，我可以負欺騙的責任。</p>
<p>『剽竊』和『附會』是有聯系性的，自己没有貨色，自己口裏没有象牙。向好古的讀者捧出古香古色的碎錦來，自是無上的法們。我們有的是『遺產』，儘可以加勁『搜索前進』，不愁没有材料，不愁不名來利也來，如果有人會不識高低，要來異議，那我可以保管這要碰以古字第一號的擋箭牌，保管你會吃不消</p>
<p>坦坦白白地好古，我們會容易看得出來，假若你是一個青年，你會駡他『古董』，『頑固』，但是你碰着捧出『整理遺產』這一類的烟幕彈的人們，你定會說他們『有功文化』。所以什麽事都得有手段，比如有些人的裸體攝影是下流有些人的裸體攝影便是藝術了，你明白這一點，你便會明白這社會我一切。</p>
<p>『附會』與『剽竊』的人們會『煞有介事』，大放烟幕彈，還會『奇貨可居』，使毛頭小伙子們嚇倒，雖然有人會覺得『味如嚼蠟』，要感到肉麻。</p>
<h3>集團結婚</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>結婚，是一件麻煩的問題，不要說結婚以後的種種問題，能把你累得要命，甚至累得自殺，卽使在結婚的籌備以至婚禮的舉行，也能把你麻煩得頭昏眼花，團團而轉的。</p>
<p>但是人類，就有這點奇怪，無論在結婚之前或後，旣曉得有這種種地麻煩，但，到了相當的年齡的時候，還非要舉行一下不可，仿彿麻煩儘管由牠，事情仍須舉辦，這原因，則是在「家庭」的成立。在現代的人的眼光裏，假使你没有舉行，對於自身還在其次，那輕視的態度，倒是免不掉的，尤其對於窮人。</p>
<p>然而想要舉行，的確太困難了，這時代，是被資本的毒雰籠罩着的，兩性間互相結合的婚事，也有點商業化了。</p>
<p>在資本主義的社會裏，錢是最主要的成分，有了這白琅琅的大武，隨便什麽事都容易解决的，可是，這年頭太不景氣了，眞有力量的能有多少呢？</p>
<p>於是，有許多人在喊着：「提倡儉約婚禮！」</p>
<p>這回響怎樣呢？我們知道，在這舊的潛勢力没有絶跡以前，在這由風俗習慣所造成的傳統的觀念没有剷除以前，那效率是很有限的，是極其微薄的。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>假使我們留意報紙上面的廣告，能時常的看到類似這樣的啟事：</p>
<p>······我倆現由友誼進爲愛侶，謹訂於某月某日結婚，惟國難嚴重，一切繁縟儀式槪行從簡，······</p>
<p>在這裏，所謂「國難」，痛快的說便是「錢難」。這種方式雖自有牠的價値，然而，没有大張喜筵的排塲，是必然的，並且，在當事人的心裏，誰又敢斷定不也想同樂一回呢？</p>
<p>現在，本市社會局在發起新生活集團的結婚，把預備結婚的男女集成了若干對，共同舉行日期是有規定的，每年舉行四次，並且，假座市政府的禮堂做禮堂，還有市長和社會局長做證婚人，這，在大體上已够排塲，而婚費的定額則爲每人十元，在經濟上，也足應付。</p>
<p>我們企望着這新興的辦法能够早日實行，更能够逐步的推廣，向糜費的結婚加以宣戰！</p>
<h3>駱駝的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 阿蘋</p>
<p>天上没有雲，朗明的月亮照着大地，茅屋中靜悄悄地，除了夜風拂着蘆柴的哨聲外，這世界彷彿死去般的。我是孤零零地，被這世界遺棄了；雖然我同情的主人，他佔有了我是想靠我爲他生利的。於是他每天牽着我到那些我所不慣行走的馬路上，見那些我所不熟稔的人物，把我作爲小丑似的供人家的笑樂。有時爲了他的營業，我常受頑皮們石子的打擊。自然，一般的說，主人的口袋寒飽了之後與我也有簡接的利益的，然而寗願我的故鄉做着笨重的工作，我不能做着愧儡似的自欺欺人！據說算命這行業的方式甚多，我的主人何以獨獨想到我來號召呢？或者我生得太醜，但是人類是愛美的，無論什麽行業的廣告總得以美女爲大前提，同行中飄着紅頭的小鳥就是這個緣故，那鳥不是相當的好玩嗎？我就不符合這條件，毛茸茸的長臉，有着一個老人那樣討厭的傴背，走路的樣子又不美觀，這眞是從那裏話起，我却負着廣告的責任呢。然而確是事實，許多生意都是買我毛茸茸臉，難道人類的愛美没有一定的標準嗎？想起來也有特殊的理由，一個超過普通尺度的長人已經値得同類去玩賞他，何况我是被稱爲「獸」的呢！所以主人的對於我愛護備至，他的用意是並不像他的舉動那樣高尙的。呵，我寂寞啊，我離别了故鄉，離别了同伴，做着主人的傀儡，做着蒙衆的玩物，我想請主人算算我的命，我下世能否投入胎？這是我做生意時聽來的，人類都問着下世怎樣的。</p>
<p>今天日裏遇見老雁，自我到這陌生世界以來第一次見故鄉的朋友，可以主人的生意要緊，我們没有說一句話的餘地，「他鄉遇故知」的權利我們都不能享有嗎？我不由得不恨我的主人了。如果在故鄉的時候，我被人這樣侮辱，我一定奮勇的跳起身來，撤開我的腿，和敵人决鬥，到他屈伏爲止。故鄉眞是偉大呵，數千萬里無垠的大沙漠，由我衝鋒陷陣。雖然我們的同類也同是被主人豢養着，但我們不分「人」與「獸」，我的互相互助，共同生活，應付一切環境。有時數日夜覓不到水草之地，我們還是勉力前進，塞北之風像箭似的刮着我們，我們毫不畏縮，那種大無畏的精神，値得自傲的。可是現在被帶到這個號稱中國第一大都市的上海來了，我旣被人玩弄着，更因伏在這狹小的周遭中，我已傷失了一切自由，做着主人的奴隶。我咒咀人類爲什麽這樣殘酷地虐待我們，總有一天我要發展我的威權回到故鄉去過我們自己的日子！</p>
<p>現在四野裏更沉寂了，老雁應該這時候來告訴我些故鄉帶來的消息，舊主人無恙耶，同伴們無恙耶，故鄉無恙耶？仰起頭來向北望去，却是一片霓紅熱的光芒直冲雲霄，這大都市永過被色情的氣氛包圍着，老雁每到這裏來，不知爲了些什麽，難道故鄉也不能立足了嗎？我寂寞啊，我已被這世界遺棄了！</p>
<h3>孩子</h3>
<p>— 朱莉</p>
<p>妻進了診察室許多時候還没有出來，我心中彷彿被蛇爬着一般，抽着烟，在候診室內徘徊。我們的危望已經完全交給了醫士，祇要他診斷的結果，我們就像聽候法官的宣判一樣。</p>
<p>候診室內病人愈來愈衆，無聊耐的目光從他們每個面上劃過，覺得生病都是屬於窮人的；然而窮人是不能生病的啊！就一直注視着診察室的玻璃窗，直到妻出來，而下一號交替進去。</p>
<p>妻面上照着一層濃霧般的愁容，我知道醫生已宣判了我們死刑。她慢慢的走到我面前，没有說一句話，就扶着我的臂灣向外走。</p>
<p>出了醫院門，我們還是没有交談一句話，然而大家都是明白的，用什話來開始呢，這似乎已是鐵一般的事實？</p>
<p>到家，孩子從僕人手中跳過來要妻抱，才見她露了一絲笑意。這是天性的流露，每一個父母，都那樣愛護他們的孩子，那末，爲什麽爲了第二個孩子的降臨而愁苦着呢！</p>
<p>當妻第一次懷孕的時候，已在我們結婚後等五年了。她時常懷念着，說我們應該有一個孩子，見了别人家的孩子就搶來抱，就是嬰孩比賽的像片，她也作爲珍寶似的剪裁下來懸掛在壁上的鏡框中。所以當醫士診斷了她確已懷孕，就像小麻雀似的歡躍起來，籌備孩子出陚</p>
<p>世後的一切，彷彿一個上年紀的婦人一樣，她是那樣週到，那樣謹愼，而且猜想未來的孩子像我，像她。</p>
<p>老實說，這也是我所期望的，不過没有她那樣的殷切。我覺得我們小家庭中没有一個孩子是太寂寞了，並且結婚了五年之久，似乎應該有一個孩子來點綴我們的生活，果然，一個孩子降臨了，他像我們理想中一般的可愛，有一張圓圓的臉，肥胖的拳頭。</p>
<p>可是繼這歡樂後面，我們被一種壓迫圍繞了，就是孩子的敎養費。我們的收入，在一般的說來，還是比較優厚的，但從這個孩子參加到我們這小家庭來，現在剛滿三歲，在我們的支出表上，他已佔了一個相當的數目，這是無論如何我們從前所没有想到的。有時往往爲了孩子的用途，引起我們口角，於是一個直覺，就是孩子長大起來，我們怎樣敎養他呢？這責任是在做父母的肩頭上。所以孩子本身雖是可愛的，但爲了這層原因，許多無辜的孩子是在這種情形之下犧牲的。自然，我們是不願意這樣做的，不過第二個孩子降臨的預兆並不爲了你不勝負擔他自然的生長起來。起初我們還希望着這預兆僅僅是個預兆，然而日子是不留人的，二個月一過去，我們擔心這預兆將證實了。不過到寶愛孩子的心還是一貫的，從她平時的口吻中她希望還要一個女兒，可是經濟的鎖鏈已是明顯地我們再不能生育孩子，這預兆怎樣地使我們恐佈着呢！</p>
<p>商量的結果，這醫生診斷，這不過是萬一的希望而已。現在這希望已完全打得粉碎，這個和樂的小家庭中將有一個可愛的敵人來參加了。我望着孩子在媽懷中歡躍的情形，不由地擔憂着他的將來呢。</p>
<h3>病中</h3>
<p>— 麗蘋</p>
<p>我在病中收着你第三封信了！阿林，原來你所關懷的英，現在正利害的病着：啊！雖則我的體溫很高，但我總不願忍心地忘却你給與我的恩愛，以及你正在遙遠地等待着我的消息。然而，阿林，你會知道狠毒的醫生是無論如何也不會允許我寫信的呀！我徒然忍痛的掙扎着起來，遭受看護婦三四次的禁止。</p>
<p>其實，阿林，我簡直失掉了執筆的手力呀！我的手是瘦得可怕，阿林，我猜得準，你若看見了我的這雙瘦手，一定要痛哭不止。可是，你得相信我，不，我的精神十二分的健康着哩。阿林，自從我們的小寶寶誕生的第二天起，一直病了四五十天，欠了醫院的錢，賬房每天來催，可是，我拿什麽給他們呢？</p>
<p>你該知道，一個孕婦，當身體一天天的重大時：怎能照常每天十幾個鐘頭的工作下去？我已停了工，算起來快六個禮拜了。</p>
<p>每當病到十分苦痛的時候，我常是悲憤的默念着。</p>
<p>－你回來喲－你，你在那兒呀！你是能醫治我的疾病的呀！······天呀！你將我的人兒帶到那兒去了呢？啊——我這樣的喊着，當然你是不會聽見的；可</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>是，同房的病人都爲我的瘋狂而嘆息哩。我們的純姊，不住的爲我拭去眼淚。</p>
<p>－别這樣吧！英妹，－純姊總是每天哭着嗓子的安慰我。－你該知道，你有丈夫是爲了人類的將來而離開你的，他不能放棄自己的使命而照顧一個病了的妻子，何况他現在還不知道你在害病哩。</p>
<p>我痴呆的望着他顫抖的嘴唇。她又接着說：</p>
<p>－你應當這樣想：應當忍痛地寬恕你的丈夫呀！－我只得藏着頭盡情地講哭。啊！原來我是不能這樣孩子似的眷戀着你的！</p>
<p>今天我再將你的來信重讀了兩遍：每讀一遍，有一種新的恩情重重地壓在我的心頭。只有你的一字一句，才能安慰我的心靈，更能使我對你的信心加重。</p>
<p>在你的來信中，我神仰着異地的風光。你告訴我你很康健；然而我能够想像得出你的肉體是十分疲乏，至於你的精神是十分愉快的。因爲我相信你的事業是會給與你無限的慰安。可是，我們的分離會給你覺得十分苦痛；但是，這個人的創痛，决不會傷害你莫大的精神。我的阿林！我知道，我們可以爲社會奮鬥而置愛情於身外；我們不能花前月下的等着帝國主義的宰割！何况你的妻在誠摯的等候着你的成功。這個愛情的鼓勇，最少可以給與你相當的興奮。</p>
<p>再說：我們是年青的夫妻，同時更是患難的伴侶；我們應該鼓勇着熱情前進！我怎能使你爲我而放棄更重大的事業呢？</p>
<p>親愛的阿林！我們要永遠堅定着我們的信仰與意志啊。</p>
<p>但是，阿林！我畢竟在害病的時候還渴望着你能卽刻歸來。現在，我已清醒地克服了我的感情了，你當知道那是病態，不値得你因此傷感的。知道嗎？一個革命的戰士是不可以傷感的。那麽，你爲什麽要如實的向你告白呢？你知道，這是我對你的純眞不能有所藏隱。</p>
<p>醫生在勸我不要太感傷，就此擱筆。敬祝你努力！</p>

<p>開篇「新斷弦」</p>
<p>世界好事不久常。妻死夫留最慘傷。出門少有人招應。傷哉門上鎖三黃。抱子官官婦家轉。冷冷清清進內堂。風吹錠帛微微響。遺容一副像妻龐。幽命燈一盞靈前罷。檯下花鞋留一雙。曾記得賢妻說一句。穿上了此鞋過端陽。到如今黃泉路上步忙忙。重思想。更悲傷。一场少興到廚房。灶頭上面灰塵積。殿內供奉灶君王。傍邊還剩水半缸。傷心萬種歸房去。但見內青銅寶鏡也無光。桌上亂堆針綫匾。。抽屜內常存玉偏方。羅帳半幅銀勾掛。條條錦被疊空床。欲娶續弦扶幼子。又恐晚娘狠心腸。傷心血淚鴛鴦枕。三更夢裏會妻房。正欲談論家常事。黑猫捕鼠拆銀缸。忽然驚醒邯鄲夢。三更燈火夢黃梁。世界最苦是斷弦郎。</p>

<p>申報建築周刊</p>
<h3>蘇俄之繁榮建築</h3>
<p>— 嚴明</p>
<p>「建築」一門，在現代國家的重要，凡是略具現代知識的人，誰也明白的。「建築」不但是表現一個國家强弱的象徵，同時牠又是整個國家生命所繫的「生命綫」，關於建築的重要性，以及提起民衆對於建築重要的注意，本刊已經有過不少的文字叙述過了。但我們目前所看到的，一般都市市民，以至於全國的國民，他們只知盲目的歌頌都市的繁華，若然問他們都市爲什麽繁華，以及都市繁華與建築方面的密切關係，他們簡直是矇在鼓裏，一些也不會知道的。因此，我們來從實際上闡揚建築與都市繁榮的關係，爲了使都市的市民以至於全國的國民對於都市繁榮進一步的認識起見，依然是刻不容緩的事。</p>
<p>現在我們且抛開政治的立塲，只是純粹站在技術的觀點上，來說一說蘇俄的繁榮與建築，究竟發生着怎樣的關係。所謂「借他山之石，攻自己之錯」，也許對於我們不是全没有益處的。</p>
<p>蘇俄自實行了兩個五年計劃後，社會一天天趨於安寗，是誰也不能否認的事實。在蘇俄，不論都市與農村，都日益向着繁榮的路上走，與歐美各國日益增長的經濟恐慌，恰成一個很好的對照。我們曉得，現在的莫斯科與列寗格勒，在十八年前是很勉强的可以放在世界大都市中的，然而目前已一躍而變成世界數一數二的大都市了。依照目前的情形看下去，也許最近的將來，便要超過倫敦紐約也未可知。蘇俄革命後爲什麽能够這樣突飛猛進呢？蘇俄的大都市又爲什麽能够單獨的走向繁榮的道路呢？這些問題的解釋，可以完全歸在「建築」的關係上。首先我們要知道，蘇俄的已故革命領袖列寗曾經說過：「都市建築加電氣化再加蘇維埃，等於社會主義」。蘇俄政府接受了列寗這句話，第一個五年計劃，全國上下，都在不斷地埋首於建設事業。不消說，所謂建設事業，主要的卽是包括建築方面的事業。進一步，在這裏也可以說：建築與建設，乃是一而二，二而一的東西。我們現在且來從實際方面看蘇俄建設之在建築上的成績吧，蘇俄自實行第二届五年計畫後，在工業方面，鋼鐵重工業的發展，軍事工業諸部門的增設，瓦斯電氣工業的迅速擴大，在本國及外國建築家，工程設計家集中努力之下，已落成上面所述的各種工業的工廠，逹九百所以上。向來被稱爲荒漠地帶的西伯利亞貝戈爾湖一帶，現在也是重工業的中心之一，在建邊，重工業工塲的設立，更是不可勝數。同時蘇俄不僅是工業部門中工廠數量的增多，一方面在工廠建築的技術方面，也逹到了最高水準。將幼稚的小規模的技術，提高到新的高級階段，作爲更進一步的社會建設的準備。蘇俄工業與建築技術上所逹到的程度，最使歐美各國企業家驚奇的，便要算第泊洛水力發電所，斯太林瓦斯工廠，列寗鋼鐵工塲這些偉大設計的建築了。在輕工業方面，蘇俄的棉織工塲，製絲工廠，紡織工塲和其他一切輕工業部門，也是在以同樣的速度發展着，收獲了莫大的效果。這些都應首先歸功於建築家，工程設計家，及無數的建築工人的。由於工廠及工塲建築的廣大的成就，因而提高了生產能力，且保證了廣大工人生活上的安定。在農業方面，第一届五年計劃是在將散漫的小農經營，集中到廣大的集體農塲和國立農塲中去，關於集體農塲與國立農塲的擴大，僅就兩年中來說，計新建築了二○○·○○○新集體農塲，與五○○○新國立農塲。這些農業上的建設成績，在建築史上是從來不曾有過的。因爲建築了這種大規模的農塲，所以生產力更强大，收獲更豐富。在交通建築方面的成果，也不亞於工業農業諸方面。第二届五年計劃開始以來，蘇俄國內鐵道建築的延長，已增至原有數量一倍半以上。同時新的道路與新的重噸橋樑的建築，也已可與美國並駕齊驅。</p>
<p>另一方面，反映着經濟發展的蘇俄文化建設，其表現於敎育方面的，好像每一個學校，不是專門的，没有一個不是爲了蘇俄的經濟建設——第二個五年計劃而設立的。所有每年一批一批從學校畢業出來的學生，簡直可以說十分之九是建築家，或工程設計家，爲着第二個五年計劃，負指導工人建築整固蘇俄的任務。</p>
<p>我們看了上面所述的蘇俄實際建設成績，與她們的日益繁榮，都是蘇俄的建築家與工程設計家們，領導着工人，集中力量，首先以「建築」造成的。我們不但只是羨慕蘇俄建設的成功，或讚美蘇俄建設的偉大就足够了，主要的我們應該墮解爲什麽他們能够建設成功？爲什麽他們能够獨自向着繁榮的道路上走，而别國都相反呢？這一切都是他們全國上下，都具備着現代建築的智識，又能脚踏實地的做去，才能造成今日的成績。不然的話，那末，在我們相反的不是聽到農村破產的消息，便是見到都市畸形的發展；没有實際的建設，中國的都市與農村，是永久不會繁榮的。最低限度，假使全國國民能瞭解建築的重要性，以及建築在現代國家的需要，或則建築在中國也曾逐漸普遍起來的。</p>
<h3>無名英雄墓行將落成</h3>
<p>— 雅潔</p>
<p>一千九百三十二年一月二十八日，日本海軍陸戰隊，藉故向我防軍挑釁，我方誓不屈服，遂與之周旋，乃釀成空前之大戰爭。上海本繁華之地，通商之區，一旦成爲戰塲，情形危急，戰况激烈，亦意料中事，更幸我奮勇將士，如十九路軍第五路軍用命，將敵方擊退，而予以重大打擊，遂使國人爲之興奮振起，國際觀聽，爲之一變，而使帝國主義侵略者，亦知我中華民族，固有好男兒在焉。日軍旣遭失敗，乃遣將調兵者屢屢，一反昔之視我爲易欺之信念，而努力抗戰，故戰况之瀲烈，情形之慘壯，得未曾有，而尤以第五路軍於廟行鎭，滅敵殺寇之一戰，爲最激昻悲壯，雙方犧牲，均不計其數焉，我人於今將近一二八戰爭之三周紀念，得弗念已爲國家爭生存，爲民族爭光榮之犧牲將士，而一掬同情之淚，以祝其精神之不死，爲之營葬，以慰先烈於地下乎，於是乃有築無名英雄墓於戰地廟行鎭之芻議，以示長思毋忘之意。</p>
<p>今者，前爲戰機所毁之穴洞，已經平坦；樹木之遭戰火與飛機施虐者今已種植一過，氣象一新；青草昔受無數戰土踐踏，戰車行駛枯殘者，今已復現其鮮緣本色，廬山眞面目矣；今天凡履及戰區憑弔戰塲者得復覩及先之戰後凄凉殘景否，使戰士之光榮刊諸歷史，永垂不朽，以勉旣往，策方來也，使戰士之遺跡，深入人心，印象難滅，長不相忘，朗一般無名英雄灑血染汗於草茵之上者，永遠不滅，以代表我中華男兒魂，明乎此，我國當局築英雄墓，非無因也出一廟行之殘跡，原已鏟除，而於其上修建無名英雄墓，刻已正在興築中，完工舉行揭幕典禮，已决定在一二八戰爭三周紀念日，墓之地，採取刀劍形，紀念墓館係用純花崗石築成，館成長方立體式，館前闢一門，由石階攀上而至，旣進門便見館之中央鑿一泉，源泉之中，置一石製棺，以示無名英雄之歸宿地，館之四壁，盡皆紀念圖表，紀念當時十九路五路兩軍恊力抗日之詳情實况，意在激勵民衆，發揚英雄氣槪，勢吞山河，壯志凌霄，名傳千秋，墓地之下端有大門一，伴一守衛處與花園。</p>
<p>此項紀念建築物，倘循大道往游，遠見其幽雅靜嫻，樹木深蔭，隱約間遙見刀形地，矗一雄壯築物，花園內滿植樹木花菓，夾道往訪，别有風趣，此紀念墓館，僅築料如花崗青石，鋼骨，水門汀，鋼，鐵，已費去十萬元，其他應支費用，尙未在內，所幸募捐欵項爲數不少，正宜力事裝璜，壯觀瞻也，聞設計者，卽闢劃大上海計劃之工程師云。</p>

<h3>Wang Zhaoming Delivers Opening Address</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Committee Member Wang Zhaoming’s opening address to the Fifth Plenary Session reads as follows: "Fellow comrades, since the Fourth Plenary Session, Central Committee members from various regions have been engaged in suppressing bandits and other duties, scattered in different locations. Only today have we been able to gather together and convene the Fifth Plenary Session. This is a momentous occasion. The most important task of this plenary session is to listen to and review reports on political and party affairs since the last session, to understand the situation of the past, and to determine the direction of our efforts for the present and future. Since the Fourth Plenary Session, the severity of the national crisis has not lessened, but has rather increased. In this critical environment of survival, we must adhere to the principles of sincerity, unity, and shared commitment to overcoming the national crisis, as established since the Fourth Plenary Session. We must persevere and, amidst immense difficulties, maintain the stability of the political situation. This stability is not a matter of compromise or complacency, nor is it about seeking temporary peace or survival, but rather about using time to strive for progress. Since the Fourth Plenary Session, significant achievements have been made in suppressing bandits. The bandit scourge in Jiangxi has been crushed and cleared. The 'pseudo-capital' established in Ruijin and other places for several years, which they believed was deeply rooted, has been completely eradicated. The urgent task now is to eliminate the remaining bandits and to clear the bandit troubles in Sichuan. The most critical task in production and construction is the revival of rural areas, and the key to this revival lies in eliminating all kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies, and reducing the burden on farmers to increase their capacity to make a living. In May, the Central Government and local authorities, working together harmoniously at the National Financial Conference, reached a consensus and a comprehensive plan, and this hope has been realized through resolutions. If there had not been an unexpected drought this summer, farmers in various regions would already be enjoying a better environment. However, the drought is temporary, while the elimination of exorbitant taxes and levies is being implemented gradually in various provinces and will be permanent. Therefore, the hope for rural revival will eventually be realized. Other kinds of production and construction, though limited by funding, have not been able to proceed entirely or on a large scale, but continuous efforts are being made to accumulate little by little, as detailed in various reports. The above illustrates that the greatest emphasis in our sincere unity and shared commitment to overcoming the national crisis lies in seeking peace and unity. Our willingness to endure humiliation in seeking peace and unity is to maintain stability, and our willingness to maintain stability is to seek progress, so that national strength is enriched day by day and the people's livelihood is improved day by day, to resolve the national crisis. People have always lamented that meetings are held without discussion, discussions are held without resolutions, and resolutions are made without implementation. But what is the reason for this? The late Premier taught us that 'knowing is difficult, doing is easy.' We must understand that the reason resolutions are not implemented is not because implementation is difficult, but because at the time of the meeting and the resolution, no consideration was given to whether it was feasible or not, whether it could be done or not. This created the reasons for non-implementation. Therefore, if we do not engage in empty talk or high-sounding rhetoric, but focus solely on addressing the root causes, then a meeting can surely produce a plan that meets the needs, to serve as a general guideline for all work after the meeting. First, we must accurately identify the direction of implementation, formulate feasible and actionable regulations, and apply them with the will to implement. Then our ultimate goal can be gradually achieved and consistently pursued, ultimately leading to completion. Today, on the opening day of the Fifth Plenary Session, I sincerely wish that our great mission will make progress and achieve success." (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>Opening of the Fifth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee opened yesterday in the capital. It has been exactly one year since the previous Fourth Plenary Session was convened. During this year, although the international situation has become increasingly tense, the domestic political situation has gradually become more stable. The Fujian Incident had already concluded around the time of the Fourth Plenary Session, and the conflict between Ningbian's Sun and Ma was also quelled. Leaders from all sides have generally been able to recognize their own positions and have cooperated sincerely to safeguard this troubled nation. Other achievements, such as the progress in abolishing excessive taxes, the revision of educational policies, and the advancement of transportation construction, can all be commended by the people of the country and cited as facts that, during this period of national crisis, can provide some comfort and reassurance. Recently, the Red bandits entrenched in the southeast have suffered a severe crackdown and fled westward in disarray, becoming spent arrows. What should be focused on in the future is only the issue of how to manage the aftermath in the bandit areas. If there are no ravages of floods, droughts, or natural disasters, then this year can be said to be one of the most stable years since the outbreak of the national crisis, and it can also be said to be the year in which efforts to reorganize domestic affairs began. The Fifth Plenary Session is being convened at the end of this year, allowing the participants to concentrate and calmly discuss major plans for national salvation and survival. What is especially gratifying is that the leaders in the southwest, after Wang and Sun went to Hong Kong to negotiate, have reportedly recognized the necessity of unity and expressed their understanding. Therefore, the convening of this Fifth Plenary Session is truly a key to the whole country rising up in unison to save the nation and lay the foundation for an unshakeable state.</p>
<p>We have always firmly believed that China will not collapse from this setback. We also do not believe that all of our people, from top to bottom, lack the sincerity and determination to strive for progress and revitalize the country. Therefore, we have high hopes for this conference. Moreover, it is reported that the number of attendees at this session has exceeded that of previous sessions, and that the proposals from the various committees do not focus on empty rhetoric but emphasize the telegrams from Wang and Chiang. This especially demonstrates that everyone is determined to be pragmatic and does not want to use vague and hollow discussions as mere embellishments for the meeting. The telegrams first stated, "Today, the way to save the country lies in unity, and the key to achieving unity lies in peace." This is a consistent position of the people of the country, and there can be no disagreement. As for the system of balanced power as the supreme principle for dividing the powers between the central and local governments, it is clearly stipulated in Sun Yat-sen's Outline of National Reconstruction. In the future, if we want to seek a compromise between the two trends of decentralization and centralization, this is the only way to go. The concrete measures for implementing the system of balanced power are already included in the five recommendations outlined in the telegrams, which are concise and essential. From the perspective of those responsible for the central military and political affairs, this clear and distinct joint declaration is of profound significance, far beyond what words can encompass. If the various committees, when discussing the telegrams, can follow these recommendations and plan in advance the methods and steps for implementation, and use the spirit and means of peaceful unification to eliminate various real obstacles, then the achievements of this meeting will surely surpass those of previous meetings. As for the constitution, it is the fundamental law of the country and must be completed as soon as possible so that it can be implemented after being passed by the National Assembly in the future. In this way, the aspiration to end the period of tutelage and implement constitutional government, which has been prepared for several years, can also be achieved. Chairman Chiang said, "If we can apply the same united mindset that we had toward suppressing the communists to saving the country, I dare to believe that any nation in crisis can be saved by the unified mindset of our people." These words suggest that all members of the Central Committee deeply share this sentiment, and the opportunity for peaceful unification lies in this. This is also what we eagerly await.</p>
<h3>Japanese Involved in Singapore Espionage Case to Be Deported</h3>
<p>Several Japanese Nationals Currently Detained</p>
<p>Japanese Residences Still Being Searched</p>
<p>Naval Exercises Strictly Confidential</p>
<p>Singapore – Singapore is filled with restrained excitement today due to the recent reports of Japanese espionage. All official news has been banned from publication through a semi-official censorship. Governor Thomas has requested that the press immediately cease reporting on this matter, and local officials are also remaining silent. However, the search of Japanese residences continues today, and several Japanese nationals have been detained by the police and are being prepared for deportation. Although officials are maintaining strict secrecy, the general public believes that the police have uncovered spies seeking secret information about Singapore's defenses, most importantly the plans for naval and air force bases in the northeast and army development. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Singapore – British naval exercises are scheduled to take place here on Thursday. The content is being kept strictly confidential. Plans and news related to the exercises will be announced to local residents during the exercises. Currently, due to the rampant espionage case, nothing is known. British battleships, destroyers, cruisers, and aircraft will participate in the naval and air exercises to test the defenses of the recently expanded Singapore fortress. These exercises aim to test whether the naval and land forces can withstand an enemy attack. The residents of Singapore are in a state of great anxiety due to the impending exercises and the unresolved espionage case. The police and other authorities are also being tight-lipped about the investigation into Japanese spies. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Report States Warships Must Still Be Stationed in China</h3>
<p>(Washington) – Rear Admiral Stanley, Director of the Navy Department's Personnel Bureau, today released his annual report for the period ending June 30, 1934. It placed considerable emphasis on the conditions and achievements of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet over the past year. Admiral Stanley stated that it is still necessary for U.S. warships to be stationed in China. Regarding general naval issues, he advocated that the various fleets should remain stationed in their current locations. He also stated that increasing naval personnel is extremely important, as new ships are currently being built and require skilled personnel to manage them. Stanley's report was submitted directly to Secretary of the Navy Swanson, who will then forward it to President Roosevelt and the Senate Naval Affairs Committee. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>Yuehan Railway Purchases Materials from England</h3>

<h3>France Decides to Refuse Payment of U.S. Debt</h3>
<p>(Paris) – The Council of State met this morning to discuss issues related to war debts to the United States.

<h3>British Representative's Mediation Succeeds, Central European Situation Relaxes</h3>
<p>Yugoslavia Stops Expelling Hungarian Residents</p>
<p>League of Nations Asks Hungary to Reinvestigate</p>
<p>(Geneva) – The Yugoslav-Hungarian issue is quite optimistic today. Relations between the two countries have been extremely strained recently. It is now learned that a conciliation plan is underway, which will advise Hungary to reinvestigate certain officials who encouraged the Yugoslav terrorist party. If the crimes are confirmed, they should be punished. Although France is advocating for Yugoslavia and Italy is supporting Hungary, the representatives of France and Italy in Geneva now have a good understanding. This is the most promising aspect of the situation. As for British neutrality, it is of course unquestionable. It is expected that British representative Eden will be appointed as a public arbitrator. This afternoon, French Foreign Minister Laval submitted a proposal to the League of Nations for consideration. The document is sixty pages long and advocates for the establishment of the right of pursuit and the handling of political prisoners, and proposes the establishment of an international court to deal with political crimes that affect international relations. (Reuters Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Belgrade – Yugoslav Minister of the Interior Lazic today ordered that the expulsion of Hungarian residents must be stopped immediately. Those whose residence permits in Yugoslavia have expired are also not to be expelled. It is said that the expulsion of Hungarian residents was largely due to local officials being overly zealous in implementing regulations on foreigners.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters correspondent in Geneva, the Yugoslav government's halt to the expulsion of Hungarian residents has eased the tense situation. The British Lord Privy Seal Eden's admonitions at the League of Nations Administrative Council yesterday must have played a powerful role in the South government's actions. (Reuters Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>British, French, and Italian Representatives Draft Mediation Measures</h3>
<p>Views of Both Sides Gradually Converging</p>
<p>(Geneva) – British representative Eden met here today with Italian representative Aloisi and Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya for a long time. In the evening, Eden also dined with French Foreign Minister Laval and Czech Foreign Minister Benes. Legal experts from Britain and France were also meeting. Representatives from Yugoslavia and its allies also visited French Foreign Minister Laval this afternoon to discuss the urgent situation. The delegations from Britain, France, and Italy are currently drafting a resolution that could be the first step toward an understanding in the Yugoslav-Hungarian dispute. Eden will continue talks with all parties tomorrow. The situation seems to be improving slightly. It has been generally decided that Eden will be the League of Nations rapporteur for the Yugoslav-Hungarian issue.</p>
<p>The current situation has divided the countries into two factions. France wants the League of Nations to make a decision immediately, believing that the longer the dispute drags on, the greater the danger, as an unfortunate incident may draw Italy into the vortex. Britain advocates a wait-and-see approach and opposes the League of Nations making a hasty decision. However, none of the representatives from Yugoslavia, Czechia, or Romania are willing to accept the British representative's advice. It is expected that Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu will deliver a passionate speech at the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting tomorrow. The Administrative Council adjourned its meeting yesterday until 3:15 p.m. tomorrow to allow the representatives to talk to each other and ease the somewhat heated atmosphere.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Yugoslav government is requesting that the resolution mention the responsibility of certain Hungarian officials, but does not want to make it difficult for the Hungarian government or the entire country of Hungary. It has also implicitly indicated that if the South government cannot fulfill this wish, it will withdraw its petition to the League of Nations and sever all relations with Hungary in order to achieve satisfaction.</p>
<p>At the same time, the representatives of the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente expressed dissatisfaction with the speeches at yesterday's meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council. They all felt that the League of Nations Administrative Council completely ignored the evidence presented in the Yugoslav government's memorandum and only made empty talk of condemnation regarding the Marseille assassination, which cannot quell public anger. (Reuters Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>British and French Agree on Three Key Points of Draft Resolution</h3>
<p>Likely to Be Accepted by All Parties</p>
<p>(Geneva) – Since the Yugoslav-Hungarian dispute was submitted to the League of Nations Administrative Council, it has been quite difficult to resolve. Recently, many people have been pessimistic. However, since French Foreign Minister Laval and British Lord Privy Seal Eden met yesterday, the situation has clearly become more relaxed. It is generally believed that Eden has accepted the three key points of the draft resolution proposed by France, which should satisfy the demands of Yugoslavia, namely: (1) Using general language to condemn terrorism, (2) Invoking Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, stating that member states have an obligation to respect and maintain the territorial integrity and political independence of all member states, and (3) Hungary should restart the investigation into the responsibility for the Marseille assassination. It is reported that the representatives of Britain, France, and the Little Entente countries agreed on the above points last night. Only Italy and Hungary need to agree. Therefore, Eden met with the representatives of Italy and Hungary this morning and went to Laval's residence at noon. Laval also immediately convened the representatives of the Little Entente countries for joint discussions. (Havas Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) – It is reported that the League of Nations Administrative Council will appoint a small committee to consider the proposal submitted by French Foreign Minister Laval. According to the current situation, the highest power to pardon anyone accused will be in the hands of the League of Nations. (Reuters Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Advocates for the Establishment of an International Convention</h3>
<p>To Suppress Terrorism</p>
<p>(Geneva) – Today, French Foreign Minister Laval met with the representatives of Greece, Yugoslavia, Italy, Britain, and Czechia one after another, but has not yet reached a solution that can be accepted by both Hungary and Yugoslavia. Laval is enthusiastically supporting Yugoslavia and strongly advocating for the establishment of international measures to suppress acts of terrorism, so that cases like the one in Marseille will not happen again. The British and Italian representatives agreed with Laval that a solution acceptable to the parties concerned should first be sought regarding the Marseille case, and then discussed by the Administrative Council. It is advisable not to continue the discussion before such a solution is reached, as public discussions only cause confusion and are of no help. However, although the three major powers have agreed to proceed in this way, the consent of other members of the Administrative Council must also be obtained, especially Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu. On the seventh, during the first discussion of the Marseille case by the Administrative Council, Titulescu requested that the reply from Hungary to South Korea's application be submitted for discussion and refuted, and stated that the debate could not be concluded until Hungary's reply was refuted. The Administrative Council, originally scheduled to meet tomorrow morning, has been postponed until the afternoon. In addition, Laval also explained to the representatives of various countries that a good solution must be found in the shortest possible time. If it is delayed indefinitely, people will be disappointed, and the parties concerned will consider the League of Nations unreliable and seek their own solutions. If so, there will be great chaos. At present, security hangs by a thread. A slight carelessness or a momentary misunderstanding in strategy can destroy the peace of Europe. We must be extremely cautious about this. (Havas Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) – Yesterday, during the meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, French Foreign Minister Laval delivered a speech, which was divided into three main points: (1) Some Hungarian government offices are involved in the Marseille murder case and should be held responsible. (2) The Hungarian government should conduct a formal reinvestigation. (3) A draft convention should be studied as soon as possible to define the "right of countries to harbor political prisoners." It is now reported that international sources say that the Yugoslav delegation may be able to accept this draft resolution, but unfortunately, the delegations of Italy and Hungary are opposed to it. It is reported that talks will continue tomorrow. (Reuters Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Discusses Convention on Punishing Terrorists</h3>
<p>Criminals to Be Tried by International Court</p>
<p>(Geneva) – The League of Nations Administrative Council met this afternoon to continue discussing the dispute between Yugoslavia and Hungary. The Chairman, Portuguese representative Vasconcelos, will read out the French government's memorandum, entitled "The Basis for Concluding an International Convention to Punish All Political Acts of Terrorism." All terrorist acts that plot to assassinate heads of state, government leaders, members of political conferences, and attempt to destroy railways, public buildings, and ships must be punished, and it is stipulated that groups that plot or promote such terrorist acts are also subject to punishment. This convention should still follow the methods stipulated in the 1929 international convention on punishing counterfeit currency, and those who violate it will be submitted to the International Criminal Court for trial. The court will have five judges, and will only convene when there is a violation of the convention. In addition, the convention also stipulates the extradition system for criminals, the accuracy and reliability of guaranteed passports and identity certificates, and that contracting states should immediately notify the countries concerned in detail of any information they obtain about the preparation of criminal actions planned to be carried out in foreign territory. The International League of Nations must also advise its member states to allow political assassination crimes to be included in extradition treaties, as the existing extradition treaties do not allow the extradition of political assassination criminals.

<h3>Yugoslavia Will Not Withdraw from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>But Will Withdraw Its Ambassador to Hungary</p>
<p>(Geneva) – Yugoslav Foreign Minister Yeftic held private talks with members of the League of Nations Administrative Council today, stating that if Hungary is not punished for the Marseille tragedy, Yugoslavia may have no choice but to withdraw from the League of Nations. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) – A Reuters reporter learned today that the rumors that Yugoslavia intends to withdraw from the League of Nations if its demands are not met are unfounded. However, South Korea attaches great importance to the dispute between South Korea and Hungary, and has stated that its minimum demands will be announced. If these demands cannot be met, it plans to withdraw its petition to the League of Nations and take other paths to achieve its wishes. Its intention is to sever diplomatic and economic relations with Hungary, stop border traffic, and even withdraw its ambassador to Hungary. (Reuters Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>European War Veterans Promote Franco-Italian Compromise</h3>
<p>French Naval Minister Attends Conference</p>
<p>Genoa – French and Italian veterans of the European War held a friendly gathering here. French Naval Minister Pietri attended, as did French Ambassador to Italy Chambéran and dignitaries from both countries. First, Italian blind parliamentarian Del Crovato delivered a short speech, saying that if the negotiations between Italy and France are successful, not only will the two countries benefit, but it will also be fortunate for the whole world. Pietri then spoke, saying, "The misunderstandings that may have existed between Italy and France in the past have now been dissipated. France's liberal conservatism can henceforth coexist harmoniously with Italy's democracy, because both countries have the inviolable goal of the nation as sacred, which is exactly the same as the ancient Roman ideal of the happiness of the Republic as the supreme law." Pietri then mentioned French Foreign Minister Laval's upcoming visit to Italy, saying that he is the Naval Minister and Laval is the diplomatic authority, so the matter of Franco-Italian cooperation should be the responsibility of Laval. Pietri then elaborated on the achievements of the French and Italian peoples in the ancient Roman era, the Renaissance, and the French Revolution, and finally said, "France initially thought that Pan-isms were only a political method, but did not know that they were actually a social renewal method that was compatible with the national character of Italy."

<h3>Henderson Awarded Nobel Peace Prize</h3>
<p>Angell Receives Previous Award</p>
<p>Oslo – This year's Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, and the previous Peace Prize has been awarded to British writer Angell, for their efforts for disarmament and peace. The Americans Hopper, who won the Medicine Prize, and Pirandello, who won the Literature Prize, were also present at today's award ceremony. However, Woolley, who won the Chemistry Prize, was absent. This year's Physics Prize was not awarded. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Oslo – The 1933 and 1934 Nobel Peace Prizes have both been awarded to British people. The 1933 prize, worth about £7,000, was awarded to the well-known writer and speaker Sir Norman Angell, and the 1934 prize was awarded to former Foreign Secretary and current President of the International Disarmament Conference Arthur Henderson. Henderson also received the 1933 Carnegie Peace Prize of more than £2,000. The awards to both men were long expected, so the news did not surprise people. Sir Angell initially engaged in animal husbandry and mining in the western states of the United States, and later entered the press, which earned him international acclaim. From 1929 to 1931, he served as a Labour Party Member of Parliament. In 1931, he was knighted. He has written extensively, mostly on economics and politics. Sir is generally recognized as an economics expert and is known as a political commentator. Henderson has long been a pillar of the Labour Party. In 1934, when MacDonald organized the first Labour government, Henderson was one of MacDonald's confidants and was appointed Foreign Secretary. In 1931, when the current National Unity Government was established, he separated from MacDonald due to disagreements on political views. After the Disarmament Conference was formed, he was elected as its chairman and has served in this position ever since, sparing no effort to promote peace. Henderson initially worked as a moulder at Robert Stephenson &amp; Co.'s factory in Newcastle, and later became a prominent leader in the trade union movement. In 1903, he was elected as a Member of Parliament. (Reuters Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Famous French Writer Comments on Franco-German Relations</h3>
<p>Advocates for the Establishment of a Veterans' Association</p>
<p>(Paris) – Famous French writer Romain Rolland published an article in the Petit Journal, discussing France's new foreign policy and Franco-German relations, stating that the current relaxation of tensions is due to the change of French Foreign Minister. Former Foreign Minister Barthou's policies were sensitive and dangerous, causing a dense fog to envelop Europe. If he were still in office, all negotiations would be difficult. Foreign Minister Laval, on the other hand, is calm and has much to be commended. Rolland greatly praised the actions of veterans, saying that they are the backbone of improving Franco-German relations and resolving the Saar issue. He hopes that the veterans of the two countries can organize a joint committee to maintain the peace and tranquility of the two countries. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>

<h3>Czech Republic Joins Franco-Soviet Pact</h3>
<p>(Paris) – French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov signed an agreement on the 5th of this month, agreeing not to conclude "bilateral agreements" with each other during the negotiations on the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. The Petit Parisien newspaper has received reliable news that the Czech Republic has now joined this agreement, in order to express its desire to participate in the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. It refuses to sign any bilateral agreements that would hinder the trend of the pact. (Havas Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Nanjirō Succeeds Hishikari as Commander of the Kwantung Army</h3>
<p>Concurrently Serves as Ambassador to Manchukuo</p>
<p>Scheduled to Depart Tokyo for His Post on the 19th of This Month</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning at ten o'clock, General Nanjirō, accompanied by Prime Minister Okada, met with the Emperor at the Palace. The Emperor appointed General Nanjirō as Commander of the Kwantung Army, Ambassador to Manchukuo, and concurrently Governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory. The Japanese military stated that this reshuffle was a routine change. However, it is widely believed that it was caused by the resignation of the head of the Japanese police alliance in Manchukuo in protest against the reform of the Manchukuo organs. General Nanjirō was the Minister of the Army during the September 18th Incident and is considered the main culprit behind the Manchurian Incident. His appointment to this position is attracting special attention from all parties. When the Okada Cabinet was formed, the naval fleet sent representatives to pressure the government to announce the abolition of naval treaties. General Nanjirō cooperated with this faction, abandoning his former conciliatory stance and was even considered as a candidate to succeed as Prime Minister, which aroused the jealousy of senior statesmen. This appointment as Commander is seen as a promotion in name but in reality, a respectful distancing. (Hua Lian News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The reform of the Manchukuo organs has been decided to be implemented within the year. The Army authorities and the government have been considering candidates in recent days. This morning at ten o'clock, General Nanjirō has been appointed as Commander of the Kwantung Army, concurrently Ambassador to Manchukuo, and Governor of the Kwantung Leased Territory. After the implementation of the reform of the Manchukuo organs, the Governor of Kwantung will naturally disappear, so it will become an integration of the Commander of the Kwantung Army and the Ambassador to Manchukuo. It is heard that General Nanjirō will leave Tokyo for his post on the 19th of this month. The Director-General of the Manchurian Affairs Bureau will be concurrently held by Army Minister Hayashi. For the position of Deputy Director-General, the current Director-General of the Resources Bureau, Haruo Matsui, is the most likely candidate. The Army authorities plan to recommend Colonel Kumakichi Harada, the Second Section Chief of the Kwantung Army Headquarters, as the Chief of the General Affairs Section. Furthermore, the Director of the Administrative Affairs Bureau in Manchukuo (i.e., the Director of the Kwantung Bureau) will be sought from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Japan United News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The amendment of the Manchurian institutions and other official regulations and imperial ordinances will be consulted with the Privy Council after the Cabinet meeting on the 11th. Because the government urgently wants to implement them, the Privy Council will expedite its approval before the departure of the newly appointed Commander of the Kwantung Army from Tokyo on the 19th, so that it can be promulgated.

<h3>Closing of the Japanese Parliament</h3>
<p>Seiyūkai Infighting: Three Factions in Opposition</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The 66th Extraordinary Session of Parliament concluded yesterday. This morning at eleven o'clock, a closing ceremony was held in the House of Peers. The Emperor did not attend. All cabinet members and the Speakers of both Houses attended in formal attire. Prime Minister Okada read the Emperor's rescript, and the ceremony ended at 11:05. (Japan United News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyūkai is scheduled to hold a general meeting of its members on the 10th to discuss the issue of unifying the party and to decide on a course of action. It will exert its full strength in the ordinary session of Parliament to avoid repeating the failure of the extraordinary session. Although the Seiyūkai appears calm on the surface, there is extremely complex infighting within. Before the opening of the extraordinary session, the movement for cooperation between the Seiyūkai and the Minseitō did not show any major flaws. However, the way the cadres presented the emergency motions in the Diet was extremely clumsy. The old Seiyūkai faction, which had always maintained a close but not intimate relationship with the Suzuki faction, completely broke away from the Suzuki faction due to emotional incompatibility. This allowed the Tokonami faction to take advantage of the situation. Currently, the actions of the Kuhara faction are most noteworthy. Since the emergence of the Seiyūkai-Minseitō alliance theory, Kuhara has gradually expanded his power, believing that the current motion issue is a scheme by the Hatoyama faction to overthrow Kuhara's power. As a result, the feelings between the two factions have become increasingly bitter. The Seiyūkai is divided into the Suzuki faction, the Kuhara faction, and the old Seiyūkai faction, making it doubtful whether the unification issue can be realized.

<h3>Rumor of Resignation of Japanese Ambassador to Russia Ōta Yū</h3>
<p>Negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway Issue Continue</p>
<p>Japan Presents New Proposal to Russian Ambassador</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Ōta's return to Japan is supposedly for dental treatment, but because he has expressed his intention to resign, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will earnestly request him to return to his post. If unavoidable, Arata Hachirō, the current ambassador to Belgium, will be appointed to succeed him. (Dentsu News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Negotiations on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway have not yet been resolved due to several points, such as Japan's guarantee of payment and the method of paying retirement funds to Soviet employees. Therefore, at 2:30 this afternoon, Ambassador Yurenev visited Foreign Minister Hirota at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate the unresolved points. (Dentsu News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway, Foreign Minister Hirota has obtained a concrete proposal from the Japanese side regarding the issue of guaranteeing payment of material prices. Therefore, at 2:15 this afternoon, he met with Ambassador Yurenev and personally presented the final new proposal, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To avoid complicated methods such as acceptance by Japanese banking groups, the Imperial Government will deliver a public document to the Soviet government stating, "Regarding the provisions for payment of the price, the Japanese government guarantees that Manchukuo will fully fulfill them." (1) If an agreement on the price is not reached when paying for materials, a mediation committee will be established, with one member each from Japan and Manchukuo, and two members from the Soviet Union. Ambassador Yurenev immediately requested instructions from Moscow, but it is feared that an agreement will be difficult to reach within the year. (Dentsu News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Success of German Winter Relief Drive</h3>
<p>People Nationwide Generously Contribute</p>
<p>Huge Sum Raised in Five Hours</p>
<p>(Berlin) The only way to celebrate "National Solidarity Day" in Germany today was through a grand street collection for the national winter relief effort. Cabinet ministers, dignitaries from all walks of life, famous stage performers, and movie stars personally carried donation boxes to solicit donations. According to public announcements, the results of today's collection were very satisfactory, totaling 3.5 million marks, mostly from small donations of fifty pfennigs each. This afternoon, Head of State Hitler met with Propaganda Minister Goebbels to hear a report on winter relief donations. Goebbels said that the excellent results of the donations were beyond expectations. People across the country felt personal hardship, so they were willing to contribute generously, raising a huge sum of money. Today's donation time was limited to five hours. Compared to the wealthy days of Germany before the European War, when Zeppelin donations continued for five years, the amount raised today in five hours is more than double the previous amount. This shows that the unity of the people today is far greater than before. Furthermore, by region, Berlin alone obtained 200,000 marks. The largest individual donation was 40,000 marks from the President of the National Bank, Schacht, who stood at the entrance of the stock exchange, and brokers, upon seeing him, generously emptied their pockets. Prussian Prime Minister Göring and Propaganda Minister Goebbels both carried boxes and walked back and forth on Berlin's largest boulevard, collecting a total of 12,000 marks.

Next, the leader of the General Labor Union, Kiefer, spoke, expressing gratitude on behalf of the Saar people to the League of Nations Three-Member Committee and its chairman, Aloisi, saying that they had endured much hardship for the Saar issue. However, the public vote on January 13, 1935, will overthrow the most unfair part of the Treaty of Versailles and restore German sovereignty in the Saar. Kiefer then strongly criticized the activities of the newly organized Catholic Party, pointing out that these groups are actually controlled by strong anti-Christian propaganda organizations.

<h3>Italy Controls Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>The new decree on finance promulgated by the Roman government is another indication of the serious situation of foreign exchange at home and abroad. Italian businessmen are quite dissatisfied, especially in the northern industrial areas. In the past three months, Italy has lost £13.5 million in gold reserves, causing the gold reserves of the Bank of Italy to be reduced to the legal limit of 40%. The government has ordered Italian exporters to send the foreign currency obtained from the sale of their goods to the national foreign exchange authorities, and ordered the people to submit all their foreign bonds to the government in exchange for Italian currency. A committee is being organized to control the prices of Italian exports, but there are currently no restrictions on the import and export of gold. (Reuters News Agency, 9th)</p>

<h3>US Launches Major Crackdown, Busting Drug Trafficking Organization</h3>
<p>Over 750 Arrested</p>
<p>The US Federal Bureau of Narcotics in Baltimore, Maryland, is currently conducting a nationwide drug roundup, which is proceeding rapidly and is quite astonishing. This roundup is the result of seven years of investigation. In 1927, the US first discovered several large-scale drug trafficking incidents, and investigations have continued since then without interruption. This major roundup began in Baltimore and is being conducted simultaneously in major cities across the country. As a result, over 750 drug traffickers have been arrested, including 178 women. By location, 20 were arrested in Boston, 34 in New York, 30 in Philadelphia, 31 in Baltimore, 24 in Atlanta, 43 in New Orleans, 37 in Nashville, 45 in Detroit, 200 in Chicago, 61 in Minneapolis, 117 in Kansas City, 41 in San Antonio, 10 in Denver, 19 in Seattle, and 43 in San Francisco. The police seized the codes used by drug traffickers, thus uncovering the trafficking organization. The codes referred to heroin as "white robes" and opium as "black robes." The drug trafficking organization sold narcotics for $80 per ounce. The police seized a large amount of narcotics, the total value of which is still unknown. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>

These fines are sometimes paid by drug trafficking groups, who view this payment as merely a type of business tax. (Reuters News Agency, 10th)</p>

<h3>French Divorce Statistics for Fifty Years</h3>

<h3>Capital Enforces Strict Ban on Opium</h3>
<p>Significance of the Anti-Opium Campaign Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 10th, at the Capital City Government Memorial Week, Secretary-General Lai Lian reported on the opium ban issue in the capital, saying that the temporary opium addiction treatment hospitals established by the City Government have been established in four locations within three days, from the 7th to the 9th: (1) Municipal Opium Addiction Treatment Hospital, (2) Hubei Branch of the Gulou Health Office, (3) Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital, (4) New Building of the Dengfushan Relief Home. Two more will be established today: (1) Renyutang, (2) Xinfuhe Elementary School. Two more are awaiting negotiation for housing and will be established within days: (1) Chaotian Palace, (2) Gulin Temple. The above eight locations can accommodate approximately 3,000 opium addicts at a time. Lai also reported on the meaning of the Anti-Opium Campaign Week, saying that holding the Capital Anti-Opium Campaign Week after the opening of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee has a significant meaning. He hopes that the central authorities will make a decisive decision and stipulate a permanent and unchangeable principle to prohibit all levels of government across the country from using opium as a source of tax revenue under any circumstances. Only then can the scourge of drugs be eradicated across the country and the national crisis be saved. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An official of the Anti-Opium Association estimates that there are approximately 7,000 opium addicts in the capital, accounting for only 1% of the total population. Compared with the opium-smoking elements in Sichuan and Yunnan, this is still a small number, making it easier to eradicate. Regarding the issue of punishing opium addicts, because opium addicts have already become useless people, it is not impossible to impose capital punishment. However, because of the large number of people, we cannot bear to punish them without educating them. Therefore, it has been decided to first use coercive methods to order them to quit in order to open the way for rehabilitation. If they are found to relapse after rehabilitation, the City Government will have stricter sanctions. The methods are currently under discussion. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The capital will strictly enforce the opium ban and hold an Anti-Opium Campaign Week. The New Life Movement City Party Headquarters and the City Government will discuss the implementation measures within days. (Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The capital has organized a Committee for Eradicating Opium and established temporary opium addiction treatment hospitals, etc. The estimated cost is 100,000 yuan. Kong Xiangxi, the director of the fundraising group, has promised to allocate funds from the Ministry of Finance immediately. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Polish Trade Agreement Negotiations</h3>
<p>Warsaw Special Dispatch: Poland is currently in a period of intense commercial negotiations. Talks on concluding new commercial agreements with many countries have resumed. The first to resume were the Anglo-Polish trade agreement negotiations. The United Kingdom occupies a very important position in Poland's foreign trade. In the past year, the goods purchased by the United Kingdom from Poland were worth 15 million Polish zlotys, or 19.2% of Poland's total exports. Germany ranked second with 17.5%, and Austria ranked third with 5.8%. The importance of the United Kingdom in Poland's foreign trade has an important economic impact on the current negotiations. The recent increase in British investment in the Polish market has a significant influence on these negotiations. Between 1931 and 1934, Poland concluded three loans with the United Kingdom, namely the telephone loan in 1931 and the railway loans in 1933 and 1934. Comparatively, the amount of these loans increased each time, while the interest rate gradually decreased. The 1931 loan was £550,000 with an interest rate of 6.2%. The 1933 loan reached £2,000,000 with an interest rate of 6.4%. The 1934 loan reached £5,000,000 with an interest rate of 6.5%. In addition, British capital has also been invested in other Polish industries, such as sugar, timber, insurance, and banking. Poland is a debtor country to the United Kingdom. At the same time, it buys less from the United Kingdom than the United Kingdom buys from it. Therefore, its debt can be compensated by its trade surplus, so the United Kingdom can better understand the soundness of the Polish economy, because its goods transported to the creditor country are sufficient to offset its debts to that creditor country. This opinion is recognized by the most influential politicians and economists in the United Kingdom. Although some British people have doubts about the existing Anglo-Polish relations, Poland's trade surplus with the United Kingdom should receive good attention in this trade agreement negotiation.</p>

<h3>Strict Eradication of Opium Seedlings in Huian, Southern Fujian</h3>
<p>Troops Ordered to Go to the Countryside to Supervise the Eradication</p>
<p>Jinjiang County Will Also Eradicate Opium Seedlings</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, the people of Huian County in southern Fujian have privately planted tens of thousands of acres of opium. After the provincial government found out, it strictly ordered the Quanzhou-based Southern Fujian Bandit Suppression Headquarters and the Huian County magistrate to jointly and severely eradicate it. Xiao Jing, the bandit suppression commander, and Yang Yu, the Huian County magistrate, immediately issued a notice to the people, setting a deadline for automatic eradication. Those who failed to do so would be sent to the countryside to supervise the eradication. Those who replant after eradication will be sentenced to death, and the township chiefs will be held jointly liable. After the notice was issued, many people were still watching. Therefore, the county government joined forces with the garrison troops to go to the countryside to supervise the eradication. According to the Huian News, the Chen Security Group was ordered to supervise the eradication of opium seedlings. The group left a platoon in Tuling, and the rest all went to the Batou area on November 18. They went to the countryside every day to supervise the eradication. On the 18th, villagers in the areas of Zhongcuo, Shanyao, Batou, Fengwei, Guocuo, Sanchen, Shi Wu Wang, Tukeng, Xiao Cuo, and Xialupai saw the troops going to the countryside and automatically eradicated them. There were no less than 20,000 acres of opium seedlings in the Batou area. The supervision of the eradication took ten days to complete. The group is currently leaving the ninth company under Xu Yubu stationed in Batou for supervision. The rest will then open up the Tuling and Wangchuan areas. On November 27, they went to various townships near Tuling to supervise the eradication. The townships of Sanxiang and Huangtian in the area, relying on their high mountains and mountains, and the townships of Hongcuo, Kengqian, Ouhengxi, and Dashe, because they were located in the mountains, did not eradicate them in the end. The eighth company of the Chen regiment arrived in Sanxiang on the 29th, and the sixth company arrived in Yiban. They all implemented the supervision of the eradication. However, the Wangchuan area was originally close to the county seat. When the troops went to the countryside, not only did they not eradicate them, but they continued to sow them. On the 29th, the Chen regiment sent the third company and the seventh company and convened a meeting of the township chiefs of the Wangchuan area, declaring that they were ordered to strictly enforce them and must not disobey the crime. Currently, the townships of Fengqi, Xudai, Wangchuan, Shekeng, Houkeng, Xishan, Xifu, Nanzhuang, Tapu, Liuxia, Chuicuo, Ganlu, Qianyang, Houpan, Dongcun, Sheba, Xiashe, Weitoukeng, Nanku, Xiazhuang, Houxu, Wangsha, Nanwei, Qianxing, and Xiwei have all been more than half eradicated. Also, the Dongling and Tuzhai areas, which are located in eastern Huian, have started the eradication of opium in northern Huian first. Therefore, the troops have not yet gone to the various townships in the two areas. Generally, after the Wangchuan and Tuling areas are eradicated, troops will be sent to them. The Huangtang area is located in western Huian and is connected to Tianchuan. It was once occupied by the bandits Wang Lianming, Wang Hanmin, and Wang Yunlong, who have been executed. It has always been called the bandit lair. The people do not fear the law. Since the Republic of China, poisonous flowers have been everywhere for many years. On December 3, the Chen regiment sent the fourth company to the area to start supervising the eradication. Chen Peiyu, the head of the regiment, also personally went to the area on the 5th to convene a meeting of township chiefs, preparing to eradicate them all within half a month. This is the current situation of the eradication of opium in Huian. In addition to the large-scale private planting of opium by the villagers in Huian, opium seedlings were also found in the Jinjiang County Golden Well Stone Lion townships. The Jinjiang County magistrate summoned the chiefs of each district and strictly ordered them to be eradicated automatically within a time limit. If they failed to do so, troops would be sent to the countryside to supervise the eradication. (December 8)</p>
<h3>The Pizhou Bandits Fled to Southern Shandong</h3>
<p>The Remaining Bandits Are Trapped in Guozhuang</p>
<p>The Police and Group Strictly Defend Northern Pizhou</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence, Pizhou is located in the northeast of Xuzhou and is adjacent to Shandong Province. When the Liu Guitang bandit force disturbed Lidong, the 7th Division troops had set up defenses in northern Pizhou. Later, the Liu bandits fled north, the troops were demobilized, and the local bandits joined forces and gradually formed a large force. Also, because the land is located on the border of northern Jiangsu and borders southern Shandong, it is easy for roaming bandits to secretly multiply. Wang Depu, the administrative inspector and security commander of the Tongshan District, felt that the Pizhou bandits were rampant during his inspection of eastern Xuzhou this time, so he launched a large-scale suppression. In addition to transferring the Tongshan and Suining County security teams to Pizhou to cooperate in the suppression with the Pizhou County security team, he also telegraphed to transfer a battalion of the first regiment of the provincial security team stationed in Suqian to Pizhou, concentrated their forces, and added temporary organization. Wang sat in Pizhou County to supervise the suppression and organized a bandit suppression cooperation association, offering rewards for the arrest of bandit leaders, and setting a deadline for clearing the Sutangying area in the third district of southern Pizhou and Xiaoliuzhuang and Guozhuang, where there are large bandit gangs of about 100 people. Each team attacked together, first defeating the bandits in Sutangying, and then trapping the remaining bandits in Guozhuang. They abandoned the village at night and fled across the water. Each team pursued and killed many hostages. The Tongshan and Suining security teams returned to defense, and the provincial security team remained in southern Pizhou for defense. Currently, civil self-defense forces are being organized. Wang presented Qin Jieren, the magistrate of Suining County, for his outstanding performance in handling Baojia, to the province to be transferred with Fei Gongxia, the magistrate of Pizhou County, and ordered that residents in each Bao who have guns should be organized into a detachment, with the Bao chief concurrently serving as the detachment leader. Each township will form a regiment, with the township chief concurrently serving as the regiment leader. Each district will form a squadron, with the district chief concurrently serving as the squadron leader. The county magistrate will concurrently serve as the squadron leader of the entire county. After the organization is completed, simple military training will be carried out. After the bandits in southern Pizhou are resolved, the police and group forces of Pizhou County will set out to attack. Most of the bandits have fled to Yixian, Yishui, and Tancheng in southern Shandong. Wang then telegraphed Han Fuju, the chairman of Shandong Province, to request cooperation in the suppression. Han telegraphed back saying that he had ordered the Li Brigade stationed in southern Shandong to intercept them. Currently, northern Pizhou is also defended by the police and group to prepare for a pincer attack. Wang returned to Xuzhou yesterday, leaving Chief of Staff Li Fuzhen in Pizhou to command. After the affairs in Xuzhou are completed, he will go to Pizhou for inspection to complete the local self-defense force and prevent bandit troubles from growing again. (9th)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou City West Fire</h3>
<p>The Ruyi Fang Market Reduced to Ashes</p>
<p>More Than One Hundred and Fifty Shops Burned Down</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Ruyi Fang in Huangsha, Guangzhou City, located in the west of the city, is a prosperous commercial area. However, as it has not yet been developed into a proper road, the shops are densely packed side by side. Recently, with high winds and dry conditions, a fire broke out at the Xiang Zhan ironware and general merchandise store, number 140 on the street, at 2:20 AM on the 2nd of this month, due to carelessly discarded embers behind the shop, causing a conflagration. That night, a fierce north wind was blowing, and the wind fueled the flames, quickly turning it into a raging fire. Firefighters from all over the city rushed to put out the fire. However, due to the narrow streets, fire trucks could not get close, and could only pump water from the river and spray from a distance. As a result, the fire raged fiercely. Furthermore, the buildings of the shops were mostly made of wood, which easily caught fire, making it even more difficult to extinguish. The fire brigade tore down structures to create firebreaks to contain the flames, while also rescuing residents from danger. At that time, the red glow lit up the sky, and the cries of people filled the air, creating a truly tragic scene. The fire spread so widely that it was impossible to approach. The small fire trucks were like a drop in the bucket, unable to make a difference. Later, firefighting ships on the river used hoses to pump water and fight the fire. After four hours of chaos, the flames were finally extinguished at 6:00 AM. However, the entire Ruyi Fang market had been reduced to ashes, with more than one hundred and fifty shops burned down. Several dozen boat dwellers' shacks were also burned, and seventy or eighty boats along the shore were destroyed by the fire. An investigation revealed that the burned shops included numbers 52 to 162 (even numbers) on Huangsha police district, a total of 57 shops; and numbers 45 to 159 (odd numbers), a total of 58 shops; plus 7 shops with additional numbers, totaling 121 shops. Among them, 89 were stores, 14 were residential units, and 1 was a public place. In the E Tan police district, 31 shops were affected by the fire. In total, the two districts had 152 shops affected by the fire. During the fire, an elderly boat woman drowned while trying to escape the flames. On land, no less than four or five hundred shopkeepers and refugees were affected, with more than a hundred people left homeless, shivering in the cold, snowy night. The next day, charities in the city purchased cotton clothing and food to distribute to the victims. (December 3rd)</p>
<h3>Taixian County's Unauthorized Levy of Field Tax for Guiding the Huai River</h3>
<p>County Residents Petition the Provincial Government to Stop It</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government issued a general order to all counties in the Huai River region to mobilize labor for guiding the Huai River, originally stipulating that no wages would be paid, but that laborers would receive eight cents for food per cubic meter of earth moved. As such, each county obeyed the province's order. Zhang Yi, the magistrate of Taixian County and concurrently the chairman of the Taixian County Guidance of the Huai River Labor Mobilization Assistance Committee, believed that the provincial rate of eight cents per cubic meter was too low. He decided that, in addition to the eight cents provided by the province, the local government would add another fifteen cents in wages, requiring approximately 157,500 yuan. Including the committee's operating expenses, the total cost was estimated to be around 200,000 yuan. He issued a public notice to levy a field tax per mu. The residents of the county believed that levying a field tax without requesting approval from the provincial departments violated Sun Yat-sen's principle of "voluntary labor," Chiang Kai-shek's principle that "the people have an obligation to serve the public every year," and the policy of the Huai River Guidance Committee on labor mobilization. Recently, it was heard that local gentry Huang Tong had been publicly elected to separately submit petitions to the provincial government's finance department, requesting that it be stopped.</p>

It planned to handle the case according to military law and submitted a request to the province for instructions. Now, the county government has received approval from the province to escort all suspects and witnesses to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters for trial at 1:00 AM on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Villagers Repel Lake Bandits</h3>
<p>Four or five li southeast of Xiangcheng, at 11:00 PM on the night of the 9th, twenty or thirty lake bandits landed from the Yangcheng Lake area, carrying torches and weapons, and swarmed towards nearby villages, intending to rob them. Villagers spotted the torchlight and immediately beat gongs to gather a crowd. They used muskets to shoot down one bandit. Fan Hao, the leader of the 2nd Security Brigade stationed in the town, also heard the alarm and led his team to the scene. The remaining bandits, seeing the situation was unfavorable, began to flee. The wounded bandit was captured. On the morning of the 10th, he was taken to the city. He was identified as Xu Jingaog, but claimed he felt unwell, and he had been injured on the head. He was said to be very dangerous and needed to be sent to the hospital for treatment before being interrogated.</p>

<h3>Thugs Murder and Commit Arson in the Middle of the Night</h3>
<p>In Hongjiatan Village, Bacheng Township, Kunshan County, there lived an elderly Henan woman named Zhu, in her sixties, and her son, Minghai, who had been renting and farming land there for more than ten years. Their lives were generally comfortable. Unexpectedly, the night before last, in the middle of the night, Gao Laowu and Gao Beiquan from Tongzhou in the neighboring village, along with several others, broke down their door, ransacked the house, and tied up and beat Zhu and her son. Zhu, who was old, was strangled to death. Not satisfied, the thugs set the house on fire, and the three rooms were quickly consumed. At the time of the fire, Minghai was tied up but managed to struggle free and escape. Zhu's body was burned into charcoal and was difficult to identify. Afterwards, the township chief, Qian Wosheng, reported the incident to the Fifth Public Security Sub-Bureau. Sub-Bureau Chief Bao dispatched police to arrest the perpetrators, Gao Laowu and Gao Beiquan. Yesterday, they were escorted to the county government and taken into custody. In the afternoon, examiner Zhang, along with a coroner, went to the scene to conduct an autopsy. The victim, Zhu Minghai, sustained serious injuries and is currently receiving treatment at Kunshan Hospital. It is said that his life is in danger.</p>

<h3>Bean Trade Restores 99 Discount</h3>
<p>The Wuxi Rice and Bean Merchants Association, due to the declining grain prices and the increasing burden of taxes and expenses last year, found that the original 99 discount was insufficient to sustain their operations. They specially changed it to 98.4, which caused a strong backlash from grain merchants in Bengbu. Through the mediation of the Chamber of Commerce, the rate was changed from 98.4 to 98.6, with the stipulation that if the price of miscellaneous grains and beans exceeded five yuan, the 99 discount would be restored. Merchants in Wuxi and Changzhou uniformly complied. Recently, bean merchants in Bengbu, seeing that the market price of soybeans had gradually increased and had long exceeded five yuan, sent a letter through the Chamber of Commerce to the Rice and Bean Merchants Association, requesting that the original agreement be upheld and the 99 discount be restored. Upon receiving the notification, the Rice and Bean Merchants Association immediately convened a meeting of its members and obtained the consent of the Wujin Bean Trade. It was decided that, starting from January 1, 1935, the 99 discount would be restored, but only for Bengbu beans from the north and south rivers. The other bean varieties would not be included.</p>
<h3>Younger Brother Killed by Older Brother; Perpetrator Arrested</h3>
<p>Wang Quanbao, a fisherman living in a boat under the awning outside the West Gate, in front of the Fifth Fire Brigade, had an argument with his older brother, Wang Quansheng, last month due to a business dispute, which led to a fight. Quanbao was severely injured and died the next day. Quansheng, realizing he had caused a disaster, fled to escape punishment. The local branch of the court sent a letter to the county government, ordering the public security organs on land and water and all local militias to arrest him. Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, Zhong Jihe, the captain of the Public Security Bureau's detective team, learned that the perpetrator, Wang Quansheng, was planning to take a Jiangnan bus to Yixing to hide. He immediately dispatched detectives Hua Bingquan and Gao Lin to the bus station, where they arrested the suspect and brought him back to the bureau for temporary detention, pending transfer to the local branch of the court for trial.</p>

<h3>Celebration Rally Held Yesterday in Shanghai by Various Circles for the Victory Over the Bandits and the Opening of the Fifth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>More than 3,000 People Attended the Meeting at the Chamber of Commerce in the Morning</p>
<p>Flags Were Hung Throughout the City, and Airplanes Scattered Leaflets in the Sky</p>
<p>Over a Hundred Cars and Five Ships Paraded on Land and Sea</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai representatives' celebration rally for the victory over the bandits was held at 10:00 a.m. yesterday in the auditorium of the Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Temple Bridge. A car parade was held in the afternoon, and representatives from all walks of life attended. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Attending The representatives who attended yesterday's celebration rally included: Chen Kecheng from the Municipal Government, Xing Wan from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Tao Baichuan from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Tian Heqing from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Xu Zeye from the Municipal Education Association, Yu Zhenhui from the Municipal Farmers' Association, Yu Zuoting from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Huang Hanliang from the First Special District Citizens' Federation, Mao Yun from the Second Special District Citizens' Federation, Lin Kecong from the Municipal Women's Association, as well as over 3,000 representatives from various trade associations, labor unions, schools at all levels, and party and government organizations.</p>
<p>Xing's Report After the ceremony, Xing Wan of the presidium first delivered a report, stating in brief: Since unifying China, the Chinese Nationalist Party should have had ample opportunity for national and social construction. However, the circumstances at the time made it difficult to fulfill this wish. The root cause was the occupation by the communist bandits, which was a major obstacle. The Party took action to separate from the communists around 1928 because the communist party not only undermined our Party but also the country. Since the separation, the communist bandits first launched a major riot in Guangdong, then fled to Jiangxi, using it as their base for rebellion. At that time, the communist bandit scourge extended to nearly seven or eight provinces. The central government, facing foreign invasion and internal strife, although it mobilized a large army for encirclement and suppression, could not achieve immediate results. It was in this difficult situation that Chairman Chiang personally visited the front lines, supervised the soldiers, and won the support of the people, leading to today's unprecedented victory over the bandits. From this, we have learned (1) that nothing is impossible under the heavens, it only depends on our efforts and struggles. Today, disregarding all difficulties, we fight to the end with the spirit of revolution and have achieved this victory, which proves that the Three Principles of the People will surely triumph. The communist party in China is very different from the communist party in Soviet Russia. The communist party in Soviet Russia is still based on the nation and ethnicity, while the communist party in China is merely a peasant uprising from the feudal era. (2) If we do things based on the spirits of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, we can accomplish anything. Now that the red bandits in Jiangxi have been defeated and the remaining bandits will soon be eliminated, from today onwards, the first stage can be considered complete and the second stage will continue to begin. The focus of the work in the second stage should be on production and construction. Production and construction should have the following preconditions: (1) The entire nation should unite with sincerity. The so-called sincere unity is different from the cooperation that people generally talk about today. Since we are all comrades of the same party and compatriots of the same country, we should cooperate with each other. (2) Implement the recent telegram between Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang to achieve balanced power. The power of balanced power is the power to handle affairs. In other words, the personnel of local governments should be truly responsible. It does not mean that with the implementation of balanced power, local areas can freely handle everything and govern themselves. Therefore, in the future, if anyone deviates from the original intention of balanced power, they should be suppressed with the spirit of defeating the bandits in the past. (3) Production and construction must require the people of the whole country to abide by order and discipline. The so-called abiding by order and discipline must also be imbued with the spirit of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace. If so, the future of the country will surely be bright and full of hope.</p>
<p>Tao's Speech Tao Baichuan then delivered a speech, briefly stating: Comrade Xing has reported in great detail on the significance of celebrating the victory over the bandits. However, I would like to add a few points to Comrade Xing's remarks on the points of effort for the future. Although the red bandits in Jiangxi and Fujian have been defeated today, these fellows still have 100,000 men and 30,000 guns, and have fled to places like Sichuan and Guizhou. With Sichuan's treacherous terrain and abundant resources, I fear they will still cause trouble in the future. In the past, the red bandits had two routes: one was the international route, and the other was the Luo Ming route. In the past, the Third International sent the Indian Luo Ming to China for secret investigation. After returning, he made suggestions to the Third International. He believed that the Chinese red bandits in Jiangxi and Fujian were easily blockaded by the Party's military fortresses and highways to their death, so they should flee from Fujian and Jiangxi to Sichuan, and then hope to seize Shaanxi or Gansu, so as to connect with Inner and Outer Mongolia, so that the Red Army of Soviet Russia could be contacted at any time. This is the so-called Luo Ming route. However, the Third International did not adopt it. The Third International believed that the Chinese red revolution had reached the stage of maturity, so it should develop towards the Yangtze River and Pearl River basins and seek to seize cities. This is the so-called international route. There was a fierce debate between these two routes in the Chinese Communist Party. Now, the international route has been defeated by the central government's policies of highway fortresses and blockades. Therefore, these fellows may engage in the Luo Ming route. Therefore, we should intensify our work in the future, taking advantage of the red bandits being newly wounded, and the Party's army can take advantage of the victory to pursue them to seek thorough elimination. In addition, regarding the work of continuing to suppress the bandits, military force only accounts for three parts, while politics accounts for seven parts. This is the experience that Chairman Chiang has gained over the years, and he has set this grand plan. In the past year, the work of suppressing bandits in Jiangxi and Fujian has followed this spirit, so there is today's victory. Furthermore, peace and unity are indeed important for China today. Although this statement has become a cliché, it is actually very important and should not be ignored. In the past, the reason why suppressing bandits did not win victory was because the internal chaos had not been extinguished. Today, the country is relatively peaceful and relatively unified, so it can achieve unprecedented victory in suppressing bandits. After the victory over the bandits, attention should be paid to the completion of local autonomy. The important tasks of local autonomy are education, nurturing, and defense. Educate the people so that everyone has knowledge; nurture the people so that everyone can live and work in peace; and protect the people so that everyone has armed force. If so, the country will be prosperous and the people will be safe, and the people will not be exploited by the red bandits, and the nation can rely on it to revive. There was also a speech by Lin Kecong, which was lengthy and will be omitted.</p>
<p>Condolences to Chiang After the speech, the preparatory office of the conference proposed to send telegrams to comfort Chairman Chiang and the bandit suppression soldiers, which were unanimously approved by the conference. The telegrams are recorded as follows: (1) Telegram to comfort Chairman Chiang and the bandit suppression generals and soldiers said: The red bandits have been rampant for many years, harming the Party and the country, and poisoning the people. The disasters they caused were even more severe than those of Chuang and Xian. Fortunately, you supervised the army to suppress them severely, and the generals and soldiers bravely killed the bandits. As a result, the poisonous atmosphere was swept away and the people were rescued from fire and water. The news of the victory has spread, and the sea is rejoicing. The foundation for the revival of our Chinese nation has been laid here. We hope that you will strictly order the front-line generals and soldiers to take advantage of the victory and drive straight ahead, thoroughly eliminate the remaining evils, and avoid future troubles. This is our sincere comfort.</p>
<p>Telegram of Congratulations to the Plenary Session (2) The telegram of congratulations to the Fifth Plenary Session said: (Title omitted) Today, the red bandits in various places are gradually being eliminated, and domestic politics is becoming increasingly unified. This is a good opportunity for our nation to recover from the extreme. Your conference is convened at this time to hold a plenary meeting to discuss and plan for internal peace, external resistance, unified construction, and to comfort the people's hope. This is our sincere telegram of congratulations.</p>
<p>Complete Autonomy (3) Please ask the Central Government to eradicate local bullies and complete local autonomy, said: (Title omitted) The red bandits have been rampant for many years, causing disasters even more severe than those of Chuang and Xian. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang supervised the army to suppress them severely, and they were gradually put down. The important plan for the future should be to learn from the past, eradicate corruption and local bullies, promote local autonomy, and implement economic construction, so as to eliminate the bandit scourge forever and revive the nation. Local autonomy is an important plan for political tutelage, economic construction is a source of benefit for nurturing the people, and corruption and local bullies are the cause of banditry in a negative aspect. If local autonomy can be completed, the people will have a correct understanding of politics and a deep belief in the Three Principles of the People, and the propaganda and agitation of the red bandits will have no means to achieve their goals. If economic construction can be promoted, the country and society will surely achieve prosperity, and the people will be able to eat their fill and keep warm. Who would be willing to take risks and seek good luck? As for corruption and local bullies, if they can be eradicated at the same time, China can never have the matter of officials forcing the people to rebel, and local autonomy and economic construction can also be accelerated and completed soon. Now, although the central government has set the above three points as national policies and gradually promoted them, the results are not obvious, and the day of success is far away. At this time when the bandit scourge has just been put down, it is a great opportunity for the government and the people to start anew and strive to govern. It is appropriate to promote the established national policies with the spirit of suppressing bandits and quelling chaos, so that the bandit scourge will be eliminated forever and the nation will be revived. Wouldn't it be great?</p>
<p>Blocking and Suppressing the Remaining Bandits (4) Telegram to the generals of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, and Sichuan to block and suppress the red bandits and not let them escape the net, said (Title omitted) The red bandits in Fujian and Jiangxi have been rampant for many years, causing great disasters unprecedented in history. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang supervised the army to suppress them severely, so that the ugly creatures collapsed and fled their nests far away. The people of several provinces have seen the light of day again. However, today the red bandits are running around like wolves and boars, still trying to flee to Sichuan and Guizhou to rebuild their nests. If this remnant is not strictly blocked and destroyed, the tragedy of Fujian and Jiangxi in the past will be repeated in the southwest. For this reason, we telegram to ask you to cooperate in the encirclement and suppression, without regard to sectarian views, and each with the heart of saving the country, so as to quickly eliminate the remaining evils, eliminate the roots of the disaster forever, and not let the great achievements of bandit suppression be lost in one basket. The future of the nation depends on it.</p>

(New Voice News Agency)</p>
<p>Airplanes Scattering Leaflets In order to arouse the special attention of the citizens, the preparatory committee of the conference telegraphed the Aviation Committee a few days ago to send planes to Shanghai to participate. The committee specially sent three planes to Shanghai at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to fly over Shanghai and scatter five-color leaflets and various colored pieces of paper, adding to the colorful scene, flying in the sky, which was unprecedented.

Today, we celebrate the opening of the Fifth Plenary Session and the victory over the bandits, on the one hand, hoping that the gentlemen who are shouldering the heavy responsibility of the Party and the country will gather their thoughts and formulate a grand plan for saving the country and revitalizing the nation, so as to overcome the current national crisis and promote the prosperity of the country, the development of the Party, and the enrichment of the people's livelihood.

Today, when we are celebrating enthusiastically here, the unity within the Party has already become concrete, and the military suppression of the bandits has achieved initial success. However, the lost territories in the Northeast have not been recovered, and foreign aggression is still pressing. In the future, we should make the greatest determination, do our utmost, unite with sincerity, and complete the work of settling domestic affairs and resisting foreign aggression.

<h3>Sun Ke and Guangdong Committee Members Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday After Successful Negotiations in the South</h3>
<p>Sun and Others Went to Nanjing That Evening to Attend the Plenary Session</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, went south with Central Committee Member Wang Chonghui at the beginning of the month, heading to Hong Kong and Guangdong to meet with Hu Hanmin, Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and others to discuss the matter of sincere unity throughout the country. Now that the mission has been completed, Sun, along with Guangdong members of the Central Committee attending the Fifth Plenary Session, Guan Suren and others, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon from Hong Kong on the Dollar Steamship Lines' President Grant. They went to Nanjing that evening to attend the conference. Wang Chonghui remained in Hong Kong for further negotiations and will return north in a week. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel Those who went to the pier yesterday morning to welcome them included: Central Committee Member Chen Qingyun, Shanghai Mayor Representative Li Dachao, Security Office Director Yang Hu Representative Wang Zhinan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Shanghai Office Representative Li Rongyao, Chen Jitang Guangdong Shanghai Representative Yang Dezhao, Vice Minister of Industry Liu Weichi, Former Brazilian Ambassador Dai Ensai, Legislators Sun Weidong, Huang Yio, Zhang Guoyuan, Deng Gongxuan, Wu Jingxiong, Zhong Tianxin, Chen Jianru, Deng Xuanming, Deng Zhexih, Jian Youwen, and Yu Qiaqing, Manager of the Sanbei Steamship Company, and others, totaling over 30 people.</p>
<p>Arrival Situation Sun and others traveled on the President Grant, which was originally scheduled to anchor at the Yangshupu River surface at 7:00 a.m. yesterday morning. However, due to heavy fog in the morning, it was not until 10:00 a.m. when the fog subsided slightly that it slowly entered the port. By the time it was moored at the No. 12 pontoon on the Yangshupu River surface, it was already close to noon. The welcomers had taken the Yuebao small steamer, temporarily borrowed from Du Yuesheng, and docked at the New Customs, and set off to welcome Sun at 11:00. After boarding the President Grant, the welcomers greeted Sun in the cabin corridor for about ten minutes. Sun, Fu Bingchang, and Yang Huabai (Secretary of the Economic Commission) disembarked onto the Yuebao steamer and returned to the New Customs to go ashore, changed to a pre-arranged car, and returned to their private residence on Columbia Road. As for the Guangdong members of the Central Committee who came to attend the Fifth Plenary Session together, Guan Suren, Deng Qingyang, Zhan Jusi, Cui Guangxiu, Li Renren, Li Qihan, and Li Fulin, and Hu Jixian, a member of the provincial committee who came to Shanghai for negotiations on Guangdong affairs, all took the Dollar Steamship Lines ferry to the New Customs to go ashore. Except for Li Fulin, who returned to his residence, the others lodged at the New Asia Restaurant on North Sichuan Road and went to Nanjing with Sun last night to attend the conference.</p>
<p>Sun Ke's Speech Sun told reporters in the ship, "The Guangdong trip was a complete success. I met with Mr. Hu Zhantang, Mr. Chen Bonan, Mr. Li Delin, Mr. Zou Haibin, and others. Mr. Wang Liangchou stayed in Shanghai, not to wait for my reply. He still needs to negotiate with comrades in the Southwest, so he will stay for about a week and then return to Nanjing. Mr. Hu did not make any proposals." When the ship arrived at the New Customs pier, Sun went back to his residence with Fu Bingchang and others.</p>
<p>Joint Proposal In the afternoon, Li Renren met with reporters at the hostel and made a speech on behalf of the members, saying that the Southwest members had two joint proposals, and more than 20 members from Guangdong and Guangxi were named. After arriving in Nanjing, they also planned to seek the consent of other members to sign. However, the content of the proposal, because I left Guangxi very hurriedly, so I have not read it, and the content is not clear. When passing through Hong Kong and Guangdong, I also failed to meet with Hu Zhantang, Chen Bonan, and others. I personally have no separate proposals. The current unity movement is what our country should have when the country is in trouble, and everyone agrees with it. However, it is still unknown to what extent the current unity movement has been discussed. Jiang and Wang both agreed in principle, but the method needs to be discussed.</p>
<p>Entering Nanjing That Evening After Sun and others arrived in Shanghai, they sent a telegram to the Central Standing Committee, reporting that they had arrived in Shanghai with the Guangdong members and were preparing to take the night train to Nanjing. Sun met with Li Fulin and other Guangdong and Guangxi members around 4:00 p.m. for a brief conversation. Then, at 11:00 p.m., he and seven Guangdong and Guangxi representatives took the Beijing-Shanghai night express train to Nanjing. In addition to adding a flower car for Sun, the railway bureau also added a first-class sleeping car for the Guangdong and Guangxi members, dedicated to the seven members. In addition, many important people who went to Nanjing in the same car with Sun and others included Vice Minister of Industry Liu Weichi and legislators Chen Jianru and Zhong Tianxin.</p>
<p>Li and Hu Came Together Yesterday, Central Committee Member Li Fulin and Guangdong Provincial Committee Member Hu Jixian also arrived in Shanghai with Sun and others on the Grant ship. Hu's arrival has nothing to do with the Fifth Plenary Session. It is reported that it is entirely due to the recent construction in Guangdong Province. After the three-year plan was decided, they came to Shanghai for negotiations on the funding for the steel plant construction, and they will return to Guangdong after staying for a few days.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Circles Send Telegrams to Congratulate the Fifth Plenary Session</h3>

<p>More Than a Thousand People Attended to Express Condolences</p>
<p>The Event Was Well-Attended and Orderly</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Circulation Library, the Amateur Night School, and the Women's Night School, three cultural organizations affiliated with this newspaper, held a memorial service for Mr. Shi Liangcai at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association yesterday morning at 9:00 am.

The venue was packed, upstairs and downstairs, yet orderly. The Minhang Songhu Guangci Hospital dispatched boy scouts and their entire band to the service, and the Longhua Shanghai Orphanage also sent their full band to play music. Commemorative badges of Mr. Shi were distributed. When the representative of the Circulation Library delivered a eulogy, the entire audience shed tears, followed by weeping. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement: A white cloth banner was hung over the main entrance, with the words "Memorial Service for Mr. Shi Liangcai" written in large characters. A pine and cypress archway was erected. The service was held in the auditorium on the second floor. At the entrance, many students from the Women's Night School and the Amateur Night School greeted and distributed commemorative special editions and badges. Boy scouts from Guangci Hospital maintained order. The walls were covered with couplets and streamers. The auditorium was decorated with pine and cypress, with four wreaths placed on the left and right sides. In the center was a full-length portrait of Mr. Shi, with the words "Mentor of Youth" above it. The arrangement was appropriate and extremely solemn.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: At 9:00 am, the meeting began with the ringing of a bell. First, the chairman, Li Gongpu, gave a report, stating, "It is unexpected that we are holding this memorial service for Mr. Shi Liangcai today. After hearing the news of Mr. Shi's passing, everyone, whether related or not, felt extremely saddened, especially the students and readers, who sent letters requesting a ceremony to express their condolences and respect. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Shi, we should focus our will and inherit Mr. Shi's legacy, to promote cultural endeavors."</p>
<p>Offering of Wreaths: After the chairman's report, mournful music was played. When the music stopped, everyone stood in silence to express condolences. After the silence, wreaths were offered, first by the Shen Bao Amateur Night School, then by the Shen Bao Women's Night School, and finally by the Shen Bao Circulation Library. After the three offerings, a triple bow was performed.</p>
<p>Reading of Eulogy: After the wreaths were offered, the representatives of the teachers and staff of the Amateur Night School first read the eulogy, followed by the representatives of the students of the Amateur Night School, then the teachers and students of the Women's Night School, then the representatives of the readers of the Shen Bao Circulation Library, and finally the representatives of the staff of the Shen Bao Circulation Library. The eulogies were lengthy (omitted).</p>
<p>Guest Speeches: After the eulogy was read, mournful music was played. Everyone stood up and paid their respects to the portrait of Mr. Shi. Then, Mr. Shen Xinqing spoke about Mr. Shi's life, stating, "Mr. Shi's life was marked by 'zealotry,' Zealotry to go foward, and restraint not to do wrong." He expressed hope that those attending would learn from him. Shen Bao's Mr. Zhao Shuyong then gave a speech, elaborating on the meaning of "zealotry," using examples from Mr. Shi's past. The audience was deeply moved.</p>
<p>Expressions of Condolences: After Mr. Zhao's speech, the student representative of the Shen Bao Women's Night School delivered a eulogy, stating, "Mr. Shi advocated for female education during his lifetime, giving women who had no opportunity to study the chance to do so. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Shi, we must continue to work hard according to Mr. Shi's will." The teacher representative of the Shen Bao Women's Night School then delivered a eulogy, stating, "As we commemorate Mr. Shi, we can also learn from him." The student representative of the Shen Bao Amateur Night School then delivered a eulogy, stating, "Mr. Shi worked very hard for social causes. Although Mr. Shi is dead, his spirit and work have not died. We should emulate Mr. Shi's personality and strive forward as much as possible." The reader representative of the Shen Bao Circulation Library then delivered a eulogy, stating, "We are very saddened to be here today to commemorate Mr. Shi. Mr. Shi's tragic death is a loss to society and the country. We urge the government to capture the murderers to comfort his spirit." The teacher representative of the Shen Bao Amateur Night School then delivered a eulogy, stating, "There are many things about Mr. Shi that are worthy of our commemoration. I will only mention the two most important points: first, although Mr. Shi was wealthy, he was very frugal and did not indulge in any luxury; second, Mr. Shi was willing to donate his own money to save the country and help industry." Finally, the representative of the library staff delivered a eulogy, stating, "Mr. Shi founded the library entirely for the benefit of everyone, because he came from a poor background and knew the suffering of poor people who could not afford to study. He not only lent books to people for free, but he also often urged and guided everyone to read. Today, you have all spoken about the important meaning of commemoration, which is to inherit his legacy. I would like to add that we should inherit Mr. Shi's legacy of 'working for the public and not for private gain.'"</p>
<p>Family's Acknowledgement: Next, Mr. Shi Jianguang, the family representative, delivered a thank-you speech, saying, "My uncle, unfortunately, was tragically assassinated. Today, I am grateful to the three cultural organizations affiliated with the Shen Bao for holding this memorial service. Both the living and the deceased are grateful. My uncle devoted his life to the newspaper industry, especially paying attention to culture and education. Now, he has unfortunately sacrificed himself. I hope that you will turn your mourning into support for your own endeavors and promote culture, so that my uncle will surely smile in the afterlife. Thank you all for your kindness."</p>

<h3>The Sanbei Company's "Xingshi" Steamer Runs Aground Again</h3>
<p>After being pulled out of the Datong Shoal, the Sanbei Company's "Xingshi" steamer was heading upstream to Hankou. At noon on the 9th of this month, the ship ran aground near the lighthouse below Xiaogushan, with its hull stuck in the sand, rendering it unable to move. The shipowner telegraphed the Shanghai company in a panic yesterday, reporting the grounding and requesting that a ship be sent to tow it. After the "Xingshi" ran aground, the company's Yangtze River ship, the "Qingpu," was the first to receive the news and had already sailed to the location to assist with the towing. The company received a second telegram from the "Xingshi" yesterday afternoon, stating that the "Qingpu" had tried to tow it but failed to dislodge it, and that the "Qingpu" had already left, requesting that alternative arrangements be made quickly to rescue it. After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai company discussed rescue measures and telegraphed the Jiujiang branch, ordering them to quickly send workers and a barge to the "Xingshi" to unload some of the salt before towing. The telegram stated that the "Xingshi" was aground below the Xiaogushan lightship and requested urgent assistance. If unloading was necessary, they should quickly send workers and the No. 11 iron barge. The telegram was sent in the afternoon, while awaiting the unloading of cargo to attempt a tow.</p>

<h3>Heavy Fog in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Prevented Sailings of Ships and Airplanes</p>
<p>Cleared at 11 AM</p>
<p>Starting at 1 AM yesterday morning, Shanghai experienced an unprecedented heavy fog. Visibility was limited to only a few steps. Shipping and air traffic were forced to change their schedules. The fog began to dissipate around 11 AM, but dampness lingered into the evening, threatening a return of the fog this morning. Details are below:</p>
<p>Heavy Fog Shrouds the City: Starting around 1 AM yesterday morning, extremely dense fog suddenly arose in Shanghai and along the coast outside Wusong, the likes of which have not been seen in recent decades. The fog was unusually humid and had a suffocating smell, making breathing difficult. A reporter hired a small boat to inspect the Huangpu River around 7 AM. North of Yangshupu, the fog was even thicker, with visibility reduced to only a few steps.</p>
<p>Ships and Planes Delayed: The heavy fog on the river and outside Wusong delayed ships and planes yesterday morning. According to customs officials, several ships scheduled to depart the previous night, including the China Merchants Bureau's "Jiangda" and ships on the Guangdong-Shantou route, were delayed. Ships arriving at port, including the Dollar Line's "President Grant," the China Merchants Bureau's "Jianguo," the Taikoo Company's "Xinming," the Mei-Zhi Company's "Duo Lewu," and the Shanghai-Ningbo lines' "Xin Yongxing" and "Xin Jiangtian," anchored outside Wusong to avoid accidents. They began entering the port after 11 AM, when the fog had thinned somewhat. The China National Aviation Corporation's flight No. 6 on the Shanghai-Hankou route, which usually departs Shanghai at 7 AM every day, was delayed until 11:20 AM due to the fog. The other routes, including Shanghai-Beiping, Chongqing-Chengdu, Hankou-Chongqing, and Shanghai-Guangdong, originated outside Shanghai, so the company did not expect them to be affected by the fog. According to a spokesman for the Eurasia Aviation Corporation on Renji Road, the company had no scheduled flights that day, so it was not affected.</p>
<h3>"Hua'an" Ship Crashes into a Large Sailing Vessel in the Fog</h3>
<p>Both Ship and Cargo Sink</p>
<p>Death Toll Under Investigation</p>
<p>Yesterday, outside the port of Wusong, a dense fog developed. The Chang'an Company's "Hua'an" ship crashed into a large sailing vessel. The goods were lost, and the boatmen fell into the sea. The death toll is still under investigation. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Heavy Fog at Sea: There was a heavy fog at sea yesterday, from 8 AM to 2 PM. The density of the fog was rarely seen. The sea lanes were blocked. Visibility was extremely low. North and Southbound vessels anchored near the Tongsha sandbar and outgoing ships docked at the No. 2 river piling, in total, over thirty vessels sheltered in these locations, thus breaking off sea traffic. The fog eventually dispersed and port traffic resumed after 2 PM.</p>
<p>"Hua'an" Accident: The Chang'an Company's "Hua'an" ship was sailing from Fuzhou to Shanghai. It encountered the fog yesterday off the port of Wusong. At approximately 1 PM, a large sailing vessel, fully laden with goods, was sailing out of Shanghai. Traveling roughly a mile and a half out from the Wusong port, near the No. 2 river piling, they were unable to see each other and collided. As a result of the "Hua'an" ship's impact, the sailing vessel immediately shattered and sank. All of the cargo and boatmen on board fell into the sea. It was a great tragedy.</p>
<p>Ship Stopped to Render Assistance: The "Hua'an" ship immediately stopped to assist with the rescue. The vessel was struck so violently that the mast was broken and a portion of the stern was completely destroyed in the ocean. The undamaged mast and stern were connected to the "Hua'an" vessel, and a small boat was launched to rescue boatmen. The amount of fatalities and rescues are still being investigated and will be updated when the ship's owner reports.</p>
<p>Small Boats Salvage: During the tragedy yesterday, many incoming ocean vessels were delayed due to the fog, witnessing the incident. After the fog dispersed, the sea surface around the sunk vessel was littered with wreckage, resulting in small boats racing to salvage the wreckage. The sunken vessel was very large, with many valuable goods, resulting in great damages. Due to the journalist's delay getting to the ship, details of the fatalities were not reported. As the vessel berthed in the middle of the river, it was not available to inquire further. Full details will be updated tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Woe Is Me: Wei Youjiao Cries Injustice Outside the Courthouse</h3>
<p>Abandoned by a Foreigner</p>
<p>Prosecutor Zhong Presides over Justice</p>
<p>The stateless national, Dissi, formerly had a relationship with the Chinese woman, Wei Youjiao. They lived together and had a daughter. Dissi then abandoned Wei. Wei sued Dissi in the First Special District Court, but due to insufficient evidence, Dissi was declared innocent. After the case was closed, Wei cried and shouted grievances in front of the First Special District Court every day. Dissi's lawyer, Yan Dajue, once went to the Special Court. Wei had heard rumors that Dissi had given money to Yan, asking him to reconcile with Wei. Suspecting that Yan had embezzled the money, she grabbed Yan in the lawyer's lounge and slapped him. After being persuaded by others, she let go. Since then, regardless of the weather, she stands in front of the courthouse all day long, shouting about her grievances. Prosecutor Zhong Qing of the First Special District Court saw her and summoned Wei for questioning. Wei recounted the events. Prosecutor Zhong advised her to go home. Wei claimed that her child was seriously ill, she could not afford medical treatment, and she was heavily in debt and could not go home. Seeing her plight, Zhong felt very sympathetic and summoned Dissi to court at the Fourteenth Tribunal yesterday afternoon, advising him to give her some money and send her back home, so as to avoid further disputes. Dissi claimed that Wei was a prostitute and that they had only had one encounter, so where did the daughter come from? Therefore, he refused to give her money. He also claimed that Wei had repeatedly caused trouble at the telephone company where he worked, so his job had been suspended.</p>
<p>He now has not paid the rent for three months, and he has no means of daily living. He does not know when he will be able to find a job. He is now penniless, so how could he give her money? After being persuaded by the court for over an hour, Dissi finally said that at most he could borrow thirty or forty yuan from his relatives to give her, no more than fifty yuan. The court then summoned Lawyer Yan to the court, asking him to persuade Dissi. The esteemed lawyer also made a small contribution to resolve the dispute. Yan agreed to persuade Dissi and also agreed to give Wei thirty yuan. The court then adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>Citywide Rice Merchants' Metrological Verification Yesterday</h3>
<p>Over 300 Measures Verified, Continuing Today</p>

<h3>Major Fire in Yangjiazhai, Pudong</h3>
<p>Difficulty in Extinguishing Due to Distance from the River</p>
<p>Significant Losses After Burning for Two Hours</p>
<p>Yesterday at 11:45 AM, a fire broke out in the home of Zhang Zhengping, a Siyang native, at No. 45 Yangjiazhai in Pudong. The fire quickly spread, breaking through the roof. The row of houses, consisting of five tile-roofed bungalows from No. 44 in the west to No. 58 in the east, were all inhabited by poor migrants. Cries and wails filled the air. Upon receiving the alarm, Li Beiwu, captain of the 3rd Squad of the Lujiazui Police, led his officers to maintain order and telegraphed the Pudong Fire Brigade. Zhao Longsheng, director of the brigade, led his men in vehicles to the scene to fight the fire. The 1st Section Fire Brigade of Lujiazui also sent vehicles to assist. However, the fire was surrounded by narrow alleys, making it difficult for the fire engines to enter. Moreover, the river was far away, requiring the connection of seventeen or eighteen lengths of hose, which took considerable effort, before water could be pumped to extinguish the fire. Due to the intense fire, it was difficult to control, and the five houses in the row were completely destroyed after burning for about two hours. The fire also spread to No. 49 in front (a single address for seven rooms). At that time, the firefighters climbed onto the roofs and poured water to extinguish the fire. One room on the west side of the central living room of No. 49 was also destroyed. The remaining houses were saved due to effective water application, with only the back half of four houses being burned. The fire gradually weakened. The firefighters continued to work until it was completely extinguished before stopping. Captain Li of the police team ordered Zhang Zhengping, the source of the fire, to be taken into custody and transferred to the Pudong Public Security Bureau. Zhang confessed that he was 67 years old and had previously worked in a British-American Tobacco factory. Today, his daughter-in-law was cooking, and sparks came out of the chimney, landing on the straw, causing the disaster. Director Zhang of the bureau estimated the total loss to be around 4,000 to 5,000 yuan and ordered him to be sent to the headquarters for disposal.</p>

<p>Jiang Su'e, a girl from Changzhou, is only fifteen years old. She lives with her mother at No. 24 Huai'an Lane, Baike Road, Xinzha.

<h3>Yesterday's Tea Party Held by the Yellow Society</h3>
<p>Reporting on the Origin of the Society</p>
<p>Discussing Exhibition Matters</p>
<p>More than ten renowned local photographers, including Lang Jingshan and Ma Guoliang, initiated and organized the Yellow Society. Yesterday at 2 PM, a tea party was held at the Xin Ya Cantonese Restaurant on Nanjing Road. Over thirty people attended, including Xu Shiying, Huang Bodu, Zhang Guangyu, Lang Jingshan, Ye Qianyu, Yu Yuxiang, Li Dafu, Wang Geyi, Qian Shoutie, Ma Guoliang, Zhong Shan, Luo Gu Sun, and Jiang Zhenhua. During the gathering, Lang Jingshan reported on the society's origin, stating in brief that Huangshan in Southern Anhui is the most beautiful mountain in the country. Its secluded cliffs and strange rocks, perilous peaks, and the misty sea of clouds offer ever-changing wonders. The interplay of light and shadow in the pine forests creates an ever-shifting and graceful spectacle, a truly unique scenic spot in China. In May of this year, the attendees were invited by the Zhejiang Construction Department to visit Huangshan, intending to promote the scenic area and encourage the nation to work together to develop China's rich resources and promote various industries, not just for aesthetic pleasure. The attendees deeply appreciated this purpose and therefore formed the Yellow Society to create various artworks for the nation to view and to promote the region widely. However, they recognized that their efforts were limited and needed guidance from virtuous individuals across the country, which they hoped to receive. Next, they discussed matters concerning the exhibition to be held on the 15th of this month. The gathering concluded around 4 PM with the guests and hosts parting joyfully.</p>
<h3>Delirious Young Man Attempts Suicide in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Claims to be a Disciple of the City God</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, in the evening, a young man stood in the middle of the iron railing of the Waibaidu Bridge at the mouth of the Suzhou Creek and jumped into the river to commit suicide. Because he was wearing thick clothing, he floated on the surface for more than ten minutes without sinking. Fortunately, Chinese Constable No. 21 of the Customs Water Police Station was patrolling nearby and managed to rescue him. He was taken to the police station, where he identified himself as Du Jinlong, age 21, from Tianjin. When questioned about the reason for his suicide attempt, he spoke incoherently, claiming to be a disciple of the City God of Beiping and knowing that it would rain the next day. The police chief, suspecting a mental illness and fearing he had swallowed too much water, ordered Chinese Detective Yao Guofa to send him to Renji Hospital for treatment. After arriving at the hospital, he continued to ramble, demanding that the doctor cut out his heart so that he could ascend to heaven sooner. The detective, unable to reason with him, summoned his uncle, Ru Sheng, to take him away and keep watch over him to prevent another suicide attempt.</p>
<h3>Fire Breaks Out in the South Station Warehouse</h3>
<p>At approximately 2:20 PM yesterday, a fire broke out at Export Warehouse No. 2, located on the east side behind the Shanghai South Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. The Maoxin Transportation Company, acting on behalf of a customer, was preparing to ship two boxes of children's toys. The goods were from the Lao Yongshun Xieji General Merchandise Store in the Shanghai City God Temple and were destined for Hangzhou. One box was to be delivered to the Shengxian Xiehuachang General Merchandise Store, while the other was to go to the Shaoxing Xu Yaoji General Merchandise Store. Unfortunately, due to improper packing, during the weighing process, the boxes were bumped and shaken, resulting in a sudden explosion and a series of popping sounds. Immediately, smoke and flames filled the warehouse with intense force. Station worker Li Mingzhong, along with colleagues from Maoxin and railway police officers, bravely tried to extinguish the fire. With the assistance of firefighters and police officers, the flames were quickly put out. As a result, one box of toys was completely destroyed, and the fire spread to burn four pieces of native cloth being transported by the Rili Public Transportation Company on behalf of its customers. Fortunately, Li Mingzhong managed to drag out another box of toys at the time, so Li's hands and clothing were burned. It is reported that the fire was caused by small toy pistol caps and gunpowder paper among the toys. The owner of the goods, Lao Yongshun, had not marked them, so Jun Fuchen, the officer in charge of the Luozhe Police Section, engaged in a serious discussion with him to prevent such incidents in the future.</p>

I have not received any documents from any Japanese organization. However, according to a private letter from Mr. Zeng Jinke, a Japanese cultural group hopes that I will go to the East to lecture, and I will persuade him to travel. I replied immediately and am considering it. The itinerary and schedule have not been decided yet. I hope to disclose the facts. I wish you well, Jiang Kanghu, December 8.</p>

<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Fawning Smiles Meet Lamp-Lit Haggardness, Kicking Drives粉风流</p>
<p>After saying this, he turned around, seeming to walk home. How could Yueying not know the seriousness of the matter? If her uncle turned against her and wouldn't let her family live in his house for three generations, then they'd immediately have to go out and beg for food. It wasn't just about begging; her elders would be worried to death. They'd come from Gansu to Xi'an with hope, fleeing for their lives, but now that hope was gone, and they couldn't go back. At that moment, she rolled her black and white eyes and smiled slyly at Auntie Hu. Auntie Hu was acting angry, turning her body away, so she didn't see Yueying's smile. However, while Auntie Hu didn't see it, someone else happened to see it and made eye contact with Yueying. Yueying's sly smile was practically directed at him, which made her extremely embarrassed and flushed red, lowering her head. This person was a young man in his twenties, wearing a dark blue cloth outfit, including a blue cloth military cap. He was clearly a student, as he was carrying a large satchel under his arm. The student had come to Little Western Heaven and entered a completely new environment. He had no intention of looking at fashionable girls like Yueying. However, since she had smiled at him slyly, it couldn't be accidental. There must be a reason, so he stopped and looked at himself, then at Yueying. At this moment, Auntie Hu turned her head back, and Yueying smiled at him, saying, "It was my fault just now. I shouldn't have been like that. Now, please take me; how can you?" Auntie Hu said, "You're willing to go yourself." Yueying said, "I was willing to go myself." Auntie Hu smiled slightly, "Hmph! You've figured it out, let's go." (87)</p>
<h3>The Twin Immortals</h3>
<p>— Wang Yun</p>
<p>The world today is truly a kaleidoscopic world. On the one hand, new scientific inventions can make people fully enjoy many happinesses that predecessors have not enjoyed. On the other hand, reviving national martial arts is making the amazing skills in "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants," "Little Five Gallants," and "Continuing Little Five Gallants" realize one by one. The recent news, "Twin Immortals" setting up a hall in Taishan County, is loudly rumored in Guangdong and Hong Kong newspapers, which has the meaning of martial arts novels. I have to introduce it to the general readers:</p>
<p>"Twin Immortals" are not two immortals, but just a young monk, but his nickname is called Twin Immortals. In the past, in Cengbian Village outside Taishan City, there was a villager named Ceng, who had seven sons. Because his wife had too many children to feed, and life was quite difficult, she sent the seventh son, who was only two years old, to the Shaolin Temple monk "Flying Half a Day" as an apprentice. The monk took Ceng's son back to the mountain, taught him martial arts, and gave him a nickname, called Twin Immortals. Counting from the time he went up the mountain until now, he has experienced twenty-two winters and summers. Only this summer did he follow his master's orders and go down the mountain to travel and visit friends.</p>
<p>Two months ago, he came to Guangzhou alone, living in the home of Shaolin master Chen Dou. Later, he visited Taishan County and found that there was a National Martial Arts Research Hall, he could not help but be happy, and Taishan was also his hometown. Therefore, a few days ago, he came to Taishan to visit Li Canyuan, the executive director of the research association. Li happened to be going to Guangzhou for business and could not meet him. The people in the association, because he was a wandering monk, did not dare to entertain him. The Twin Immortals found another lodging place and waited for Li to return to Taishan. After a few days, Li had returned from Guangzhou, and the Twin Immortals went to visit him again. Li listened to his self-description and did not quite believe it, so he ordered the Twin Immortals to perform his skills. After the performance, the monk was indeed deeply familiar with the essence of Shaolin and Wudang techniques, and his skills in luck, light body, walking on the water, and the gecko's ability to climb walls made everyone watching in the audience gasp. Li offered such a talented person, the opportunity was unprecedented. He retained the Twin Immortals to set up a hall to teach apprentices, to pass on the lost knowledge. The Twin Immortals were also very willing to serve their hometown and agreed generously. The monk is 24 years old, and only eats half a bowl of rice per meal, has an innocent and cheerful personality, like a child. He is also very polite in dealing with people.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Xia Cenjuan)</p>
<p>A son watching his own parents get married, and then watching his parents get divorced, is an absolutely unheard-of strange thing. But it actually exists in modern times, and it is not considered a strange thing, because the parents first make a transaction, give birth to a son, and then choose an auspicious day to open the shop. Isn't this a son watching his parents get married? After a few years, the parents disagree, hire lawyers, and fight lawsuits, each going their own way. Isn't this a son watching his parents get divorced?</p>
<h3>College Students and Dancing</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Since Japan banned college students from entering dance halls, the dance hall business has plummeted, and the lives of the dancers have become difficult to support. But our Shanghai is now also banning college students from embracing women in dance halls. Under this new policy, what impact will our dance hall business and the lives of dancers have? I think this may be what the readers want to know.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met a friend who works as a bookkeeper in a dance hall. He said that this ban does not have a big impact on Shanghai's dance halls, because the business of dance halls in Shanghai that are above the average level is not built on the wallets of college students. Foreign affairs personnel, civil servants, university and middle school professors, and the so-called Xiaokai of Shanghai are the food and clothing parents of general dance halls. As for college students entering dance halls, in Shanghai, they account for a very small index. In this very small index, six or seven out of ten are entering the dance hall with dance partners. Two or three out of ten are going to small dance halls, where each yuan can dance six or seven times. In a formal dance hall, there are very few people who are willing to spend money to buy dance tickets for the dancers. As for opening champagne and sitting at a table, it is even more impossible to expect from college students. Therefore, since the ban on college students dancing, except for two or three small dance halls in Shanghai that have been slightly affected, there is no such thing as an impact on the entire dance industry.</p>
<p>Judging from the above, our Shanghai college students may be one notch higher than Japanese college students.</p>
<h3>Pursuer on the Path of Chinese Education</h3>
<h3>A Record of Magician Xu Jingyun</h3>
<p>— Li Taoan</p>
<p>Although magic is a minor art, its integration of general applied science effects such as physics and chemistry into the essence of games is universally recognized by the public. According to the magic performance, there are three categories: roughly divided into group performance, non-professional performance, and stage performance. Among them, stage performance is the most valuable, because magic performance, if it is not novel and unique, will inevitably not be able to enjoy its name for a long time and will be naturally abandoned and eliminated. For example, the President of the World Association of Magicians, Mr. Dobin, and Vice President Mr. Henry are both well-known in the world. Mr. Dunet, the famous big hat in Denmark, is also one of them. He is still praised and has not declined. Henry and Dunet both traveled to China soon. When they passed through Shanghai, only my friend Xu Jingyun and two or three other magicians went to visit and had the honor to meet with them. Jingyun is young and rich in thought, good at photography, swimming, and swimming is more famous. He once won the personal championship of the Shanghai YMCA members. He was not willing to use his magic to be born at first. Later, he was persuaded by friends, and he resolutely agreed to perform on stage at the New Light Theater. The audience was full every day, which shows the greatness of his magic power, which is extraordinary.</p>
<h3>The Fragrant Mist Record of the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>On the surface, the items displayed in this hall are the relics of Emperor Xianfeng, but in spirit, it can be said that these are all things belonging to the Empress Dowager! Because every relic of Xianfeng has a considerable relationship with the Empress Dowager, and they have all been stained with her touch! Therefore, these relics are actually shared by her and Xianfeng! How could she not have a special feeling when she saw her own things? But she did not move at all, just kept her face as stiff as a clay sculpture; at this time, even if there was a famous clown performing in front of her, I don't think she would laugh!</p>
<p>Finally, she slowly turned around, facing us, but still with no expression, her attitude was very unnatural. She started talking. According to my speculation, she mostly felt automatically that she had to make an explanation to us, she wanted to explain to us why Xianfeng's relics were collected so little here? In fact, she may not know that we have already seen the truth; but in order to fulfill her responsibility as a loving wife, she can't help but deliberately protect her husband. So she used a very sincere tone, trying her best to cover up everything for the昏庸Xianfeng, hoping that everyone could understand him.</p>
<p>"You have to know!" Her voice was very low. "Emperor Xianfeng was not an artist, he did not have any hobbies, and he did not like to collect any kind of toys; even the things he used every day were not particular about. To be clear, he was a person who leaned towards nature! He only loved life, and never cared about any lifeless licentious craftsmanship! He had no fate with calligraphy, painting, jade, gold and silver, or antiques! But he was still a capable ruler!" (196)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Old House</h3>
<p>— Zhao Gengdi</p>
<p>In Natsume Sōseki's "Botchan," it was described how Botchan exhausted so much effort and spirit, yet ultimately couldn't distinguish between the good and evil intentions of people towards him. This might be a similar feeling for young city dwellers. In a living environment that only produces legal terms like rape, abduction, kidnapping, and theft, searching for meaning and distinguishing between good and evil might be even more difficult than for Botchan.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in ancient Chinese poems, there is He Changji, riding a thin donkey, stepping on accumulated snow, followed by a young servant, carrying a brocade bag, a wandering poet. In Tagore's poetry, one can imagine an old man with white hair, dragging a long robe, paddling a small boat, slowly drifting through the willow shadows along a mirror-like stream. In one's own childhood memories, tightly leaning against grandfather's chest under the warm sunlight, watching a sleeping calf in the meadow, and distant, lingering wisps of smoke. Here, there's no need to search for meaning, nor to distinguish between good and evil. But those poetic rural flavors, like a dream from the night before, leave some elusive traces in the corner of one's memory.</p>
<p>For some trivial, so-called human affairs, I embarked on a homecoming journey that had been unfamiliar for several years. This vast nature received the child who had been wandering in a foreign land. In the green vegetable garden, a village woman with a floral cloth headband, picked up a surprised gaze, looking at this traveler from afar. The fields were filled with golden rice ears, gently swaying in the breeze, creating light waves.</p>
<p>Home, something I never wanted to talk about or remember, was now right in front of me. Perhaps because I had become accustomed to towering skyscrapers, or perhaps because my own body had grown, this old house seemed lower and older than I remembered. This is where I spent my innocent childhood and where my long-separated mother remained. Fortunately, she didn't seem as old as I had imagined, but it was too desolate, too quiet. I shouldn't have stayed in the city, which I considered a paradise, leaving my elderly mother to spend lonely days. I felt an inexplicable sense of unease towards her hunched and frail figure.</p>
<p>I asked someone to bring a rattan chair and sat down in the courtyard filled with slanting sunlight, stepping on the slippery green moss. For a moment, I didn't think. In the emotional vacuum, a spider was building a web under the eaves. The web connected the corners of the front and back houses. When the wind blew, the spider swayed slightly but continued to move forward in a winding path, perfectly symbolizing the non-competitive and unhurried rural life. If I were still as young as I used to be, this spider web would have been wound around the bamboo hoop of a reed flute. But now, I had no interest in these things. And for an adult to play these tricks again seemed inappropriate. I just leaned lazily against the chair. My mother came out from inside.</p>
<p>"Why are you sitting here like this? Feeling bored? The wind is good outside. There are children flying kites in the back field. You might as well go play for a while."</p>
<p>Mom thought I was still the child from ten years ago. She didn't know that I had always lived in a daydream. Yes, she shouldn't know this. Her daughter, with God's blessing, will always be lucky and happy. Dragging my tired body and taking slow steps, I went to the back field. My mother should be thanked.</p>
<p>Night came, and the dusty old house seemed desolate. My mother lit a cigarette and leaned against the couch. Perhaps she spent every evening like this. She asked me to sit in the rattan chair across from her.</p>
<p>"I know your health hasn't been good. If you feel uncomfortable outside, you should see a doctor sooner. Your mother is so far away, I can't take care of you. Also, why haven't you come back for so long? Living in other people's houses is never the same as being at home. I'm getting old and often sick. It's time for you to take care of everything at home. You don't have any brothers." Mom said.</p>
<p>My heart, which had been numb in a cold life, stirred with warm ripples. I couldn't hold back the tears, letting them drip onto my mother's sleeves and skirt.</p>
<p>The lamplight was even dimmer, and I felt a bit cold. A calico cat was sleeping warmly on the body of this unfamiliar guest. It was very dull. The night was truly deep and truly quiet. From the ancient temple across the river came intermittent sounds of wooden fish, perhaps sounds of repentance for human strife. Looking at this ancient house with peeling mud and the weary, blurry-eyed old mother, I prayed for the longevity of everything.</p>

<h3>National Labor Exhibition, Day Ten</h3>
<p>Preparatory Meeting Decides to Select Superior Products to Retain in the Ministry</p>
<p>Judge Zhuang Zexuan Arrives This Morning</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 10th) The Preparatory Committee of the National Vocational Education and Labor Exhibition held a meeting at the Ministry of Education at 4:00 PM on the 10th, and resolved: 1. Among the excellent products from various provinces and cities, after consulting with the respective provinces and cities, the most superior ones will be selected and a portion retained. 2. Expenses exceed the original budget by approximately 3,000 yuan. A decision was made to economize to prevent exceeding the budget too much. It was also decided to hold a judging committee meeting at 9:30 AM on the 11th. 4. Methods for cleaning the venue and addressing other miscellaneous issues were discussed. Zhuang Zexuan, a vocational education and labor exhibition judge hired by the Ministry of Education, arrived in Nanjing from afar on the evening of the 10th to participate in the judging meeting.</p>
<h3>National Labor Exhibition Comments</h3>
<p>The audience's criticisms of the National Labor Exhibition have already been excerpted in this newspaper. Here, we record the most recent criticisms: "The Shaanxi northern blankets are inexpensive and the items are solid, but they lack artistic refinement. If they can be improved, the Northwest industry can be developed." (Zhao Zhicheng) "Regarding machinery, it is commendable that students who usually pride themselves on using pens have produced this mechanical labor. However, aside from allowing the son of an ordinary person, many might be unwilling to do this so-called rough work." "The crafts of students from various schools should be categorized according to their nature, without needing..." (Xiong Renshou) "...to be organized by province and city, so that it can be understood in one day." (Peng Shaoqing) "The sources of raw materials for various products are mostly not indicated. For the sake of promoting the psychology of domestic goods during the student era, special attention should be paid." (Wang Fei) "Without labor, there can be no production; without production, there can be no construction. Labor and production are like the two wings of a bird, the two wheels of a car. To seek to build the nation and create culture, one must rely on this." (Chen Xun) "There are many artistic items and few practical items. Labor education seems to easily emphasize rough and durable things. I wonder if those with greater insight think this is correct." (Chang Renxia) "Generally, there is much to see, but considering aspects of 'production,' 'vocation,' 'national defense,' and 'new life,' one must not neglect them. Therefore, this exhibition will definitely have considerable gains in the future." (Liu Kaida) "Too few agricultural tools." (Cheng Ping) "The achievements listed by Shanghai Municipality have work descriptions, which is a strength." (Wang Zhenxing) "I greatly admire the embroidery of Hunan, the porcelain of Jiangxi, and the lacquerware of Fujian. If these three things are developed, they can greatly reduce our annual deficit. However, the current global economic panic has not been resolved, so there is no hope of restoring general purchasing power. Our embroidery, porcelain, and lacquerware are all leaning towards luxury. Therefore, our future is also very uncertain. I eagerly hope that our labor education policy in the future should realistically shift towards popularization and practicality." "Gengfu's waterwheel is simple to manufacture and effective, making it particularly worthy of promotion." (Chen Dong) "The end of Gengfu's waterwheel seems to still have room for improvement." (Wang Zhiping) "More promotion should be given to things needed for daily life, such as the embroidery of Hunan Province, which is not a necessity, so its proportion can be reduced." (Xie Liuqiao) "The intention of the authorities for this exhibition is something we can understand very well. They simply want to use this opportunity to promote the scientization, industrialization, and laborization of education across the country in the future. However, some of the exhibits inherit the inherent civilization of our country, and some imitate the civilization of Western Han. There are no great new creations or ingenious new inventions. This is something that makes everyone ashamed. What will happen in the future?" (Anonymous) "It is regrettable that instruction manuals are not readily available." (Zhou Yu) "All have production value and educational significance." (Shanghai Education Delegation) "From a skill perspective, the achievements in the fourth hall are relatively better, especially the products from Fujian are all successful. I think the animal enclosure at Shanghai City and An Elementary School is satisfactory because their design includes the simultaneous infusion of knowledge about gold, wood, soil, paper, and bamboo, and familiarity with many wild animals. Also, the Lianhu design of Danyang (Jiangsu) Zhengze is relatively interesting. On the one hand, it uses hands to do things, and at the same time develops children's intelligence. The products of this labor achievement are generally more advanced than before, but the majority are still walking towards the 'ivory tower' (heavy on art). This is really not what China needs now. The space is too small, not only is it easy for the audience to be crowded, but also the arrangement of achievements is too tight. This labor exhibition can be said to be a success. Not only can we see to what extent labor science is done in schools across the country, but it can also inspire the public about what kind of country China wants to be in the future." (Hang) "Promoting national power is the only definite test, which is indeed the manifestation of immersing oneself in work, being practical rather than seeking fame. If the Chinese nation can follow this path, there is no need to worry about not becoming a wealthy and strong country." (Chen Xigan) "(1) The absence of models of heavy industry in our country is something that education should pay attention to in the future. (2) There are too few models of agricultural tools, which is worrying for a country that relies on agriculture. I hope that the education sector will pay attention in the future. (3) There are many national defense models, which I find satisfactory." (Zhou Shiquan)</p>
<h3>National Vocational Education Conference</h3>
<p>Original Text of Resolutions from the Second Conference</p>
<p>The resolutions of the National Vocational Education Discussion Meeting of the Ministry of Education on the 8th have been recorded in this newspaper. Here are the formally announced resolutions of the conference:</p>
<p>Promoting Agricultural Vocational Education Plan</p>
<p>"Proposal for Promoting Agricultural Education in China" proposed by the Henan Provincial Department of Education.</p>
<p>"Request to instruct all provinces and cities to pay special attention to agricultural teaching and practice for rural teachers and rural elementary schools as a supplement to promoting agricultural education" proposed by the Fujian Provincial Department of Education.</p>
<p>"Request to the Ministry of Education to issue an order to all provinces and cities to establish agricultural instructor training classes as soon as possible to save the countryside and increase production" proposed by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education. The above three items are incorporated into this plan.</p>
<p>Principles</p>
<p>1.  In the vertical aspect, agricultural education, agricultural affairs education, and farmer education should have a solid system.</p>
<p>2.  In the horizontal aspect, agricultural vocational education should be integrated with teacher training and social education.</p>
<p>3.  The cultivation of agricultural education talent should adopt a unified approach, with cooperation from various relevant agencies in each province and city, and managed by the education administrative agency.</p>
<p>Measures</p>
<p>1.  Agricultural education: Each province and city's existing university agricultural colleges or agricultural specialized schools should conduct systematic research on local agricultural products, with the goal of improving varieties, increasing production, eliminating pests, and reducing consumption, addressing all practical problems in academics. They should also work on solving difficult commissioned experiments for various local areas within each province and city. When necessary, they may also establish short-term specialized classes or training courses.</p>
<p>2.  Agricultural affairs education: Each province and city should establish higher and lower-level agricultural vocational schools according to local needs, enrolling older rural youth, or those interested in and experienced in agriculture, and providing them with rigorous agricultural education, with equal emphasis on theory and practice. Practice should involve actual labor and technical training, with the goal of effectively guiding farmers to improve agriculture in the future. Rural normal schools should also pay special attention to agricultural teaching and practice, and teach cooperation, water conservancy, and other subjects.</p>
<p>3.  Farmer education: Each province and city should directly implement farmer education. The methods can be adapted to the time and place. The following various methods are listed for reference:</p>
<p>A. Each province and city should select appropriate locations to pilot rural improvement areas, starting with guiding farmers to increase production, while also providing literacy, health, cooperation, and other common knowledge, and representing organizations, implementing education, cultivation, and health work.</p>
<p>B. Each province and city should use existing or newly established farmer education halls or public education halls as the center for promoting farmer education, with graduates of higher-level agricultural vocational schools who have received public education training or public education graduates who have received agricultural training as directors and staff, responsible for introducing varieties, improving agricultural tools, selecting fertilizers, promoting side businesses, and organizing cooperation in a county, township, or town, while providing literacy and entertainment facilities.</p>
<p>C.

<p>Our country's proposals will be determined provisionally by the two representatives.</p>
<p>Chiang is scheduled to return to Shanghai on New Year's Day, while Liu will return later.</p>
<p>The East Asia Higher Education Conference is scheduled to be held in the Philippines on the 19th of this month. Our country's representatives, Chiang Menglin and Liu Zhanen, are scheduled to depart for the Philippines tomorrow. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Departure for the Philippines Tomorrow: The Higher Education Conference is scheduled to be held from the 19th of this month, lasting for three days. Chiang and Liu are scheduled to depart for the Philippines tomorrow on the Dollar Steamship Company's President Jefferson. According to Chiang, the conference was initiated by the Philippines, and this is the first session. The purpose is to foster relations between China and the Philippines and to promote cultural exchange. The Ministry of Education has not yet formulated our country's proposals and will determine them provisionally during the conference. Chiang is scheduled to return to Shanghai on New Year's Day, while Liu will return later.</p>
<p>Chiang Menglin on Shanghai: A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency interviewed Chiang Menglin at the New Asia Hotel yesterday regarding the issues of banning dancing for university students and unemployment. (Reporter) "Currently, universities in Shanghai are strictly enforcing the ban on students dancing. What are Mr. Chiang's thoughts on this?" (Chiang) "Banning students from dancing in dance halls to avoid neglecting their studies is appropriate. However, there are currently no dance halls in Beiping, so there is no such movement." (Reporter) "What are your opinions on the issue of university student unemployment?" (Chiang) "To solve the problem of university student unemployment, we must consider all aspects. If politics are on track and various construction projects are initiated, there will be a large demand for talent, and the problem of university student unemployment can be easily resolved. If we only focus on the education aspect, there will be no solution, because there will still be no outlet for nurturing talent." (Reporter) "Mr. Chiang, you and Mr. Hu Shih once proposed to the Ministry of Education to reform Chinese education. Has the Ministry of Education accepted it?" (Chiang) "The previous proposal contained four points: (1) Ordinary middle schools and vocational schools should be run separately. (2) Middle schools preparing students for university should pay special attention to basic subjects such as English and mathematics. (3) Vocational education should not rely on schools; more factories and farms should be established. (4) The curriculum for primary and secondary schools should be reduced. These four points were discussed with Minister Wang in Beijing, and the Ministry of Education expressed agreement in principle and is currently implementing them separately."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Middle School Athletic Association Disciplines Fuzhong</h3>
<p>Resolution of Temporary Plenary Session</p>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Athletic Association convened a temporary plenary session at 10:00 AM on the 9th at the National Sports Association office in Shenyuan. Attendees included Chen Rusong from Shanghai University, Sun Yiguang from Patriotic School, Yu Minzhi from Jinan University, Jiang Jingnan from Guanghua University, Chen Bingde from Fushi (also representing Minli and Chongde Girls' Schools), Xu Zheng from Pudong, Han Kuiyong from Fuzhong (also representing Minli), and Wu Lisheng from Shangzhong (representing Lu Xiangqian), totaling eleven schools and eight representatives. The meeting was chaired by President Lu Xiangqian and recorded by Jiang Jingnan. The discussion and resolutions are as follows: First, the incident that occurred on the 17th of last month during the football match between Pudong and Fudan Middle School at Fuzhong, involving insulting the referee, was discussed. After both parties, Xu Zheng from Pudong (also representing the Football Committee) and Han Kuiyong from Fuzhong, reported the actual situation, it was generally recognized that the person who insulted the referee was not a Fuzhong student, but an outside spectator who was unaware of the facts. Fuzhong teachers and students made every effort to stop the illegal act and protect Mr. Ni Xiaoben, who served as the referee. The circumstances were indeed excusable. However, since Fuzhong was in the position of host, this unfortunate event occurred, and according to the rules, it should also bear considerable responsibility. In order to prevent future occurrences, the following resolutions were made to punish Fuzhong for its negligence in prevention and as a warning to all schools:</p>
<p>(1) The Fuzhong school authorities shall issue a letter of apology to the Chinese Athletic Referees Association and Mr. Ni Xiaoben, who served as the referee (this Association will also issue a letter of apology to the Referees Association).</p>
<p>(2) Fuzhong's home field right is suspended for one year. All subsequent Middle School events scheduled to be held at Fuzhong will be moved to a neutral location, from December 9, 1934, to December 8, 1935.</p>
<p>(3) In the future, each school shall formally request the Referees Association or the referee by letter from the school authorities to show solemnity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was resolved that the regulations for this year's cross-country race should remain unchanged and should not be altered. The number of entries from each school shall be a maximum of ten and a minimum of six, as usual. The scores will be counted based on the first six finishers. At the same time, the Cross-Country Committee will be notified to implement this.</p>

<h3>Works that Live Forever in People's Hearts</h3>
<p>— Gu Xi</p>
<p>Reflections on "A Letter to Aspiring Writers"</p>
<p>It is works that should be written that have the capacity to have a lasting life among vast readers! That is, to write works that can live forever in people's hearts!</p>
<p>A writer must never write things that waste both their own time and others' time. Even more, they should not write things that are enough to harm themselves and their readers. The most important thing is that at the start of each writing endeavor, they should at least consider and understand whether what they are writing has strongly moved and profoundly enlightened them, and whether it possesses good and significant social meaning. Because literature, as Saneatsu Mushanokoji said, "is one of the movements that relies on expressing something from one's own spirit and finding one's confidant in the spirit of others." Therefore, it must be something that has burned one's own heart, shaken one's own soul, and moved oneself, and that one has integrated oneself with. Only then can it be generated from the depths of oneself and similarly burn the hearts of readers, shake their souls, and make them receive the same strong emotions. In this way, your work can find countless vast readers and live forever in their hearts!</p>
<p>To write a work that can gain a wide readership and live forever in their hearts is not an easy task. Unless it truly distills the author's full and substantial life, it is probably difficult to achieve this! Just saying that writing should "distill" something is already not easy. But the most important thing is to have something to supply for this "distillation." Thus, rich life experiences become most valuable to the author!</p>
<p>Every author should strive to become a person with profound cultivation, a broad perspective, and rich practical experience in life. Without this, it is as difficult to seek a great work from an author with a barren life experience as it is to seek sweet spring water in an arid desert!</p>
<p>In a letter to aspiring writers, the Soviet Literary Advisory Council tells us that Gorky's creations are unparalleled in popularity, influence, and social meaning "because he not only has the authoritative talent for description but also is extremely familiar with what he writes. In other words, it is because his authoritative talent for description is matched with the special knowledge of that description." This "knowledge of description," this "extreme familiarity with what he writes," is truly of utmost importance!</p>
<p>So, what can make us familiar with what we want to write, and give us broad "knowledge of description"?</p>
<p>To answer this question in a way that saves effort, I would like to borrow the words of A. Neverov in a novel. In "I Want to Live," when the protagonist ponders the question of "why we are unfortunate, while others are fortunate," he shouts out when he realizes the answer:</p>
<p>"Life itself gave me the answer and taught me. It opened me up with unbreakable truth!"</p>
<p>We can also say:</p>
<p>"Life itself makes us familiar with what we want to write. It opens us up with the most accurate and reliable truth, giving us the greatest amount of descriptive knowledge."</p>
<p>If Serafimovich had not personally participated in the revolutionary ranks, a great work like "The Iron Flood" would probably never have been "distilled"! If Gorky had not personally spent decades enduring a life of hardship and displacement, then "Mother," "My Universities," and many other of his immortal works might not have been discovered by us even now!</p>
<p>"The reason why Sholokhov's 'Virgin Soil Upturned' can portray the collective farm construction scene so realistically and skillfully is that Sholokhov studied the described environment very closely and carefully. The reason why Fadeyev's 'The Rout' can penetrate deeply into the masses of readers is that Fadeyev wrote the novel with materials that he had integrated, was moved by, and was extremely familiar with." It is said that Goncharov spent many years observing and working in real life to depict an Oblomov. From this, it can be seen that all great works cannot be obtained by chance. Writing a work that lives forever in people's hearts is not an easy task. The writer must concentrate their entire spirit on it, and the crystallization of the writer's true "whole self" must be revealed there. Only then can it become outstanding, profound, and appear great! This work is certainly not easy to come by, but we must strive toward the difficult and profound!</p>
<p>Laziness, timidity, and complacency will never succeed. Why do we, who aspire to write, not educate ourselves by delving into the vastness of life, making ourselves a person with correct education and broad experience?</p>
<p>"Seeking knowledge from the 'ceiling' and choosing materials from the 'fingers'" always leads to failure. Why do our authors create things that are alienated from themselves or even things that they know nothing about? (Why should those who only know West Lake write about Siberia? ...)</p>
<p>Every writer must write accurately and truthfully about what has moved them and is constantly active before them. Only by skillfully writing about something that seems to have the warmest feelings for oneself can it easily become a great work with solid content, strong power, and deep impressions, and thus penetrate into the hearts of people that cannot be easily reached, living forever!</p>
<p>The poet Balys Sruoga once sang such a song:</p>
<p>My song is made of pain and tears,</p>
<p>Forged by the sorrow of sleepless nights…</p>
<p>My song is full of cries, moans, and heartbreak,</p>
<p>Ringing out across the earth…</p>
<p>It burns the hearts of people with sorrow, making the happy feel sad;</p>
<p>That song itself is present above people's grief,</p>
<p>Ringing out and wailing endlessly!</p>
<p>Like that "song," which can "itself be present above people's grief, ringing out and wailing endlessly," let our writing also reach this state!</p>
<h3>Literary Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zaiqing</p>
<p>Gorky's memoir about the poet Alexander Blok tells of Blok encountering a street prostitute one bleak night. He held her on his lap with melancholy, spending the night in silence. The next day, without a word, he gave her all the money he had on him, and left with a heavy and gloomy heart.</p>
<p>Reading the diary of the French painter Van Gogh, I unexpectedly discovered a similar story. It said that when the painter Van Gogh was in dire straits, he went to a publisher to ask for a small loan to live on. The publisher was relatively enlightened, not utterly vulgar. After saying a few business-minded words, coupled with the conclusion, "Okay, people say you have talent. Here, here are a hundred coppers," he actually "bestowed" it.</p>
<p>From these two stories, we can very well see the greatness of artists, a kind of unattainable compassionate feeling. However, the problem also lies here. Blok gave away all he had, but could that prostitute save herself with his bit of money? Would that one night mean that, as our poet imagined, she would no longer sell smiles on the street? In fact, it is impossible. Van Gogh, when he saved a hungry old woman in the rain and snow, preferring to go hungry himself, that was his extraordinary quality. But, setting aside his own hunger, if he encountered a second, or even a third, such pitiful woman when he had no money left, what power would he have to help them? Those deserving of pity are definitely not limited to the one old woman he "bestowed" upon. "How could I obtain thousands of houses?", even if one had this thought, it would only be a "painted cake."</p>
<p>Poor artists, you should think on a grand scale!</p>
<h3>Great Panic</h3>
<p>— Ding Quan</p>
<p>The school inspectors are coming, the spot exams are coming, and the director of education is also coming. The students are panicking, the teachers are panicking, the business office is panicking, and the workers are also panicking. Students who usually don't burn incense are now forced to cling to Buddha's legs at the last minute. No one can be seen in the playground during the day. As soon as class is dismissed, everyone grabs a book and runs to a sunny place to sit down, eyes fixed on the book without turning. The few who remain in the classroom are also looking down, racking their brains. There's no need to call the roll at night; no one makes excuses to go to the toilet. Upon entering the door, they quickly pretend to pull up their pants when they see the teacher. Look, no one is whispering, no one is using yawns to express impatience with time. Everyone faces a book like a close friend. When the dismissal bell rings, everyone sighs that time is too fast. At this time, the students can truly be said to be cherishing every minute.</p>
<p>Wanting to look good is human nature. Who wouldn't want to have powder applied to their face? Therefore, various meetings to prepare for the spot exams and the school-leaving exams have been held, and naturally, some measures have been decided. Who doesn't hope that the class they teach will shine? Who isn't happy that the subject they teach excels? Thus, everyone puts in great effort, adding hours, adding handouts, warning students, and persuading students, and the students become vigilant (the students here are already very diligent), day and night. Originally, candles were not allowed to be lit after the lights were turned off, but this has been an exception for the past few nights. Originally, if there is something on one's mind, it is impossible to sleep peacefully, and the candlelight shines in the dormitory in the middle of the night. In the morning, before the sky is even bright, the sound of reading begins to rise on all sides. Even in the toilet, there are people muttering and spelling English.</p>
<p>Teachers are afraid that students will not be able to gain face, and what students fear is that there will be too many failing grades, demotions, and expulsions!</p>
<p>Students ask the teacher about the areas they should pay attention to, and the teacher gives a summary, at least this summary brings up everything that has been learned. The English teacher tells them to study English well, the math teacher tells them to work hard on calculations, and the Chinese teacher adds an extra Chinese essay outside of class for the students to practice (the topic is of course guessing what might come out).</p>
<p>Girls are even more timid, and their level of fear is even greater. They think in their hearts: if one person fails, one person is expelled, if one class fails, one class is expelled, if the whole school fails, even the principal and teachers are expelled! That would be terrible. Everyone would not be able to be together. We must work hard, strive for individual glory, strive for class glory, and strive for school glory.</p>
<p>The business office is also extraordinarily busy, planning this and planning that. They wore their legs thin with work, one thing after another. The glass on the doors and windows has been polished, new soil has been laid in the toilets, and not even a leaf can be found on the ground. Everything is fresh. Everyone is working hard, excited, serving the spot examiners, serving the school inspectors, and serving the Director of Education!</p>
<p>Until now, not one has been served, but many students are already sick in bed!</p>
<h3>The Wheel of the Times</h3>
<p>— Qian Zhe</p>
<p>In lectures on social sciences, it is easy to talk about the chain of relationships in natural phenomena. Some people say this is a "chain." However, as soon as the word "chain" is mentioned, some people think of "cycle." For example, "The way of the Three Kings is like a cycle," this is the "mantra" that a group of elder gentlemen are accustomed to saying.</p>
<p>To explain the "way of the Three Kings" is indeed not easy. Because the word "way" is so abstract, so mysterious; invisible to the eye, untouchable by hand, it is difficult to know where to start when talking about it. For the sake of "simplifying the complex," the elder gentlemen then give an analogy—"like a cycle."</p>
<p>Probably many people understand what a "cycle" is, so there's no need to waste ink explaining it. If you must explain it, then! Please look at the golden bangles that modern ladies wear on their jade arms, and you can understand what a "cycle" is like. To put it plainly, a "cycle" is a round circle that is connected to each other—it is impossible to tell which is the beginning and which is the end.</p>
<p>I also thought of a story—a teacher gave a question to students, saying that two rabbits, A and B, are chasing each other around a tree in circles. Is A chasing B, or is B chasing A? This really stumped the students; even the teacher who set the question might not have any "eight treasures" that could solve it.</p>
<p>The so-called "cycle" is probably like this, without beginning or end.</p>
<p>However, from the two words "cycle," we can easily think of wheels. Look at the vehicles on the road, the machine wheels in the factory, turning and turning, aren't they just like "cycles" without beginning or end? Some smart people, philosophers, opened their eyes wide and saw that the entire era was moving, like a wheel, never stopping. Thus, the slogan "The Wheel of the Times" easily spread and became a brand-new term.</p>
<p>The elder gentlemen who shouted the slogan "The way of the Three Kings is like a cycle" vowed not to bow their heads and also joined in the fun, shouting "The Wheel of the Times." So, these elder gentlemen can be considered "progressive," having already recognized that the times are changing day by day.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, the elder gentlemen are welcome to shout their modern slogans, but in fact, if we shine an X-ray on it, ha, this is just a trick of borrowing a corpse to return the soul. For example, they have been advocating some ancient prose all their lives, reprinting some editions of ancient books, and in their minds, it can be said to be a reflection of "The Wheel of the Times." In other words, they cite some brilliant classics as evidence, such as "Even after a hundred generations, it can be known." Why? This is all because "The way of the Three Kings is like a cycle" is at work.</p>
<p>The elder gentlemen think that the "cycle" is like a wheel; although the times are constantly turning, they are always moving back and forth in circles. In fact, although the wheel turns back and forth, the second time it turns is already different from the first time. (The first time it turns, it forces away the original air, and new air replenishes it). Moreover, "The Wheel of the Times" is not as fixed as a machine wheel in a factory; it is more like a wheel on the road. After making a circle, it has already moved to a new position.</p>
<p>It can be said that the Wheel of the Times is not as mechanical as the elder gentlemen's view of the times.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow (13)</h3>
<p>— (Joseph Conrad), translated by Wu Xiangyu</p>
<p>He took a breath, and he said very humorously, "Hey, lock the door. I don't mind if...you remember to come back and recognize me...um; what?...you can do it? In a week, you say? Humph, I dare say you can - but do you think I can stay in this dull, lifeless place for a week? Not me! I'll either go do hard labor, or join the fun, or have a place bigger than the whole of England for me to wander. Once before, I was in this place and stayed for more than a week. At that time, the old man advertised for me, and a partner who was with me suddenly thought of getting two pounds from him," he meant, he wrote some nonsense in a letter. But that trick didn't work out. We both had to leave - no one was in a hurry. But this time I have a partner waiting for me in London, and besides..."</p>
<p>Bethan Collier was breathing very rapidly again.</p>
<p>"How about I go knock on the door?" he suggested.</p>
<p>"Try it," he said.</p>
<p>Captain Hagberd's door creaked, his son's shadow moved forward, then he stopped, her ears sensitive to the sound in his throat.</p>
<p>"He's not very lively - is he? I hold him tight, I'm very worried. Many fellows often tell me that I don't know my own strength."</p>
<p>"He is one of the least harmful people alive," she interjected.</p>
<p>"If you had ever seen him chasing me upstairs with a hard leather belt, you wouldn't say that," he said, "I haven't forgotten it after sixteen years."</p>
<p>Another gentle, suppressed laugh made her whole body heat up. The knocker was making a rapid sound, he was even more nervous.</p>

<h3>Gold Prices Drop Again by 7 Yuan and 3 Jiao Amidst Unfavorable Financial Circumstances</h3>
<p>Weak Buying Power, Overwhelming Selling Pressure</p>
<p>Spot Goods Flood the Market, Difficult to Boost Momentum</p>
<p>The gold market is in a situation where the forward spread is reversed and the buying side is at a great disadvantage. It lacks the power to rise and the downward trend is strong. As a result, it continues to fall. Throughout the day, the selling side is in control. Although the buying side is trying its best, it cannot sustain it. Initially, overseas silver markets were flat in the U.S. and slightly lower in the UK. The forward silver price in Monte Rey rose by 0.015 yuan. Exchange rates fluctuated slightly. The London spot gold price rose by 0.45 yuan. In off-exchange pre-market trading, the opening bid was a strong 87 yuan. However, as there was an abundance of sellers, it immediately fell back. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with the U.S. and UK rates remaining flat. The customs gold unit rose by 0.06 yuan. The benchmark gold price rose to 1012.9 yuan. The opening price was still high. After the opening, as banks still had an appetite for buying and the foreign exchange market seemed tight, it was pulled up. However, confidence was low, and it gradually fell back as large players continued to supply. When the 3.5 yuan mark was broken, the selling pressure became even stronger. However, banks still had some buying interest. The silver equalization tax was announced to be unchanged, still levied at 6.75%. The exchange rate was calculated at 1 shilling 5 pence 65625. At this time, there was still some support after the low, and the market was mediocre, fluctuating within 3 yuan for a long time. However, confidence continued to weaken, and the supply in the market again exceeded demand. For a time, a wave of selling was triggered, coupled with the fact that Chinese merchants were still selling exchange drafts, which also caused the exchange rate market to loosen. Finally, the 80 yuan mark was broken. Although there were large players maintaining support at the low, it was difficult to reverse the overall trend. At noon, the underlying trend was the weakest. In the afternoon session, the market turned from weak to stable. However, due to the loosening of the exchange rate market and the continued supply, the downward trend remained strong. The market in national goods was buying U.S. dollars, and large players were buying at the low, and then it rose again, but it was difficult to sustain it. The initial telegram from India announced a drop of 6.6.5 annas, and confidence rose slightly. After that, it once approached the 80 yuan mark, but because of the rush to supply at the high, it turned to fluctuate again. When the bank's appetite repeatedly fluctuated, the second rise in Indian silver was 1.1 annas and then it became motionless. Then it went downstream again. However, because large players were buying strongly, it was still able to be pulled up. Finally, the bank's internal market became even tougher, and the market was ultimately weak. However, there were many supporters, so that after the close, it turned to rise back up. Throughout the day, there were rumors that spot goods were flooding the market, and the overall trend was still unsustainable. With the initial rise and then the fall, the downward trend has continued for six days, and the total number of chips has increased to more than 30,000. Today, the market situation for the day will be recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 985.5 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan compared to last Saturday. Although Hongxing, Yuanmao, and Yong retreated from 5.8 yuan to 5 yuan, Huabi bought February U.S. dollars at 3.75. Fuxing, Yongshen, Changyong, Tianfeng, and Yongshun, Maojin, and the others sold, rising to 7.4 yuan. Dadecheng, Fuyu, Richang, Hengyu, Fuxingyong, Fuan, and others sold off one after another, gradually going downstream, and confidence ultimately weakened. In an instant, it was sold to 1.5 yuan. Huabi bought January shillings at 3.75. Senchangyong, Dafayong, Ruixing, Hengyu bought at the low, rising to 3.2 yuan. Fuan continued to sell, and it dropped again to 2 yuan. At this time, the equalization tax was announced to be motionless, and confidence was uncertain. Large players still had support. Huixiang, Tianfeng, Dafayong, Yicheng, Yuxin, Xiang, and others paid the dues, gradually rising to 3.4 yuan, with a lot of struggle. However, confidence had already weakened, and the supply was very strong. Dalian Gang, Yuqingyong, and others supplied, and there was still some room for maneuver. Afterwards, Yuqingyong, Fuxingyong, Dafayong, Yonghengxing, Yuanzhaofeng, Changda, Yuqingyu, and others sold their shares, and the selling intention permeated the market. Great Britain also sold off, and February shillings at 1.875 broke the 80 yuan mark and fell to 79.5 yuan. At this time, Shunmao and Senchangyong bought at the low, and it once rose back to 81 yuan. However, the overall trend was difficult to reverse. After Yuqingyong, Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Renfayong, and others came to sell, it soon fell again to 78.5 yuan. Dadecheng and others made slight gains, with a slight struggle, but in the end, the supply side prevailed, and the noon close fell again to 978.4 yuan. After the close, Fuchang and others paid their dues and it stabilized slightly.</p>
<p>The opening price in the afternoon session was 979.2 yuan (off-exchange had retreated into 8 yuan). Soon it was 9.3 yuan. Hengyu, Qingyu, Fuan, Wanxing, and Dingkang sold out. Huabi came out with January U.S. dollars at 8.75, and confidence suddenly softened, falling to 6.7 yuan. National goods bought February U.S. dollars at 5.625. Fuxingyong, Fuchang, and others advanced to 8.9 yuan. Huabi still sold January U.S. dollars at 8.75. Dadecheng and Fuxingyong sold their dues, falling further to 7.7 yuan. Yuanmaoyong, Fuyu, Yifeng, Yongqingyu, and others came to buy. Mumbai fell 6.6.5 annas, and it rose to 9.8 yuan. Hengyu and Dadecheng sold out, and it fell again to 8.2 yuan. Fuyu, Yuanmaoyong, and retail investors did not pay, and it rose further to 9.9 yuan. Huabi bought February shillings at 3.125, and the situation stabilized slightly. Mitsui came out with January U.S. dollars at 9.375. Yuqingyong, Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, and others took the opportunity to sell at the high, falling into 9 yuan. Mumbai rose back 1 anna. Jiatai Hongxing sold to 7.5 yuan. Tongyi Fuxingyong still advanced, and then rose to 8.7 yuan. However, Huabi came out with January U.S. dollars at 34 yuan. Changda Hongxing Zhengchang and others supplied one after another, and it fell again to 7.1 yuan. At this time, it was maintained by Fuyu paying their dues from time to time. By the time the close was 987.7 yuan, Zhaofengchang and Fuyu came to buy after the close, once clamoring for a scene of 9.5 yuan. The final struggle was around 9 yuan. Throughout the day, the highest price was 987.4 yuan and the lowest price was 976.7 yuan, a total of 10.07 yuan. As a result, it fell again by 7.3 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The settlement price was listed according to the Central Bank's benchmark gold price, rising to 1012.9 yuan. In terms of the closing price, the initial debit was 35 yuan, 10 yuan more than last Saturday. The January registered price was 978 yuan. The morning make-up payment was 969 yuan, and the afternoon make-up payment was the same price. Pure gold was still 1 yuan lower than the benchmark gold price, listed at 984.5 yuan. The spot market situation was slightly loose, because the source of Dong goods suddenly surged, and there were many rumors. It was said that spot firms had received more than 3,000 taels, adding 1 yuan. Therefore, Tianjin goods also retreated to adding more than 2 yuan. However, there were no transactions. The atmosphere in the market was that the short side should pay more than 10 yuan for this forward spread, because the current benchmark is Cunfeng, and the bank has no intention of cash deposits.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was still flat. In summary, Fuyu, Senchangyong, Fuchang, Juchang, Yongli, Yifeng, Yongshun, Yicheng, Zhaofengchang, Fuxingyong, Ruixing, Hengxing, Tianfeng, Tianfengyong, Hongli, Dachangxiang, Dafayong, Wanchangyong, and others were on the buying side. Yuqingyong, Dadecheng, Yiyu, Xianghe, Yongfeng, Hongxing, Yuankangxiang, Dingkang, Zhengchang, Jiatai, Hengyu, Hengtai, Qingyu, Tongtaichang, and others were on the selling side. Dalian Gang and Wanxing jointly made about 1,000, with a slight profit after settlement. Shunli jointly made more than 100 shares, with a flat settlement. Guanglisheng was very calm, and Hengxing slightly advanced more than 100 shares. The total number of January forward shares was 30,576 shares, with a total of 66 long positions and 51 short positions. The total number of transactions on the day was 35,196 shares in the morning session and 21,483 shares in the afternoon session.</p>

The silver equalization tax was announced to be unchanged, still levied at 6.75%, and the British pound was calculated at 1 shilling 5 pence 65625. After this, the foreign exchange market was in the midst of Chinese merchants supplying, and although the banks were buying, they were powerless, and the process began to loosen. In the afternoon session, banks had mutual dealings, and the process was mediocre, but the appetite for buying was not strong.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Softens, Then Suddenly Firms Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign interbank rate suddenly became firm and expensive. The intention was initially that the Bund had public receipts, and it was later learned that the hope of deposits was not broken, and it could be done as usual. Therefore, the foreign interbank rate rose that day, and the marking fee and water were still loose. The foreign interbank rate was 2 jiao and 5 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, an increase of 4 fen compared to the previous day. The marking fee and water were initially 2-3 fen, and later done with a blank marking. In the interbank bill trading, the morning session had more than 3.5 million in transfers and more than 400,000 in new transactions. The afternoon session had 400,000 in transactions and more than 600,000 in the Small General Assembly. On that day, the position and exchange rate were tight, and the marking fee was inversely proportional. In addition, it was the 10th of the month, and the public orders were being collected vigorously, and the positions were not accurately calibrated for a time, resulting in a large disparity between surplus and deficit. The foreign deposit transaction took back more than 1.3 million and made more than 1.4 million. The banknote recovered more than 900,000 and issued more than 1.4 million, including more than 1 million in marked banknotes. The source of customers was very limited, and yesterday there were still more than 300,000, while the appetite was more than 500,000. The domestic use will inevitably converge, so there is no possibility of tension. The bank collected and settled, and foreign banks collected and settled more than 3.1 million in bills, more than 4.2 million in various goods, foreign exchange deposits, and miscellaneous expenses, more than 800,000 in foreign exchange settlement fees, and more than 900,000 in special exchange fees, and 600,000 in outbound warehouses. Chinese banks collected and settled more than 2.6 million in bills, more than 4.6 million in various goods, exchange deposits, tax advances, and miscellaneous expenses, more than 800,000 in foreign exchange settlement, and more than 1.2 million in special exchange fees, and 800,000 in inbound warehouses. Japanese banks collected and settled more than 3 million in bills, more than 4.4 million in various goods, exchange deposits, and miscellaneous expenses, more than 1.2 million in foreign exchange settlement fees, more than 400,000 in special exchange fees, and 400,000 in inbound warehouses. Qianzhuang foreign public orders collected and settled more than 8.2 million, foreign marking fees collected and settled more than 1.2 million, various exchange fees more than 600,000, and more than 600,000 in cash settlement.</p>
<p>Also, the total number of exchanges on the 10th at the local bill clearing house was 14,135,669 yuan, 2 jiao, and 3 fen in silver dollars, including 6,777,492 yuan, 9 jiao, and 1 fen in silver dollars, and 7,358,176 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 fen in exchange silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Guangjiao Dispatches 5-600,000</h3>
<p>Large Increase of 26 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small foreign exchange rose 12 yuan in the morning market, to 842 yuan, and slightly returned 1 yuan in the afternoon market, to 841 yuan. As a result, it increased by 11 yuan. The transaction was made for 8,000 jiao in the morning market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign exchange was 780 yuan in the morning market, which seemed to be a strange increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous day's morning market. The afternoon market was even worse, with an increase of 16 yuan, to 796 yuan. In this way, there was an increase of 26 yuan between the two markets, which was a rare market situation. The reason is that there are 5-600,000 outbound destinations in other ports, and in addition, it is currently in the process of increasing, so there is this movement. The transactions were made for 150,000 jiao in the morning market and 90,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper yuan increased by 1,000, to 291,000. There were 28,518 strings traded, for a total price of 9,800 foreign dollars.</p>
<h3>Securities Plunge as Public Bonds Gradually Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange and the market did not rise because the Fifth Plenary Session opened as scheduled. Instead, they gradually declined. Although the foreign interest rate increased by two points, it was not much different from before. The fundamental reason is that there were too many superficial bulls. Initially, they wanted to take advantage of the meeting to see a sharp rise and then escape, but the market showed no signs of excitement. Since the short sellers did not cover their positions, and the retail investors' appetite was also satisfied, they had no choice but to gradually withdraw. This phenomenon has been mentioned by reporters before. Yesterday's market price did not rise due to the replenishment of the Fourth Issue, and the decline should be even more severe. It can be seen that the use of environmental conditions must also take into account the actual supply and demand of chips in the market. Yesterday, only the 16.50 and 54 Issues were successively sold off, and the chip supply and demand situation gradually became balanced. After that, the rise and fall will depend on the news during the meeting. If the appetite for the Fourth Issue is enthusiastic and persistent, the future is also very easy to trigger a rebound. Yesterday's process was a gradual decline throughout the day. Until after the close, starting from the Unified Tax, the Fourth Issue became more and more courageous in buying, and the sellers were slightly wary, so they gradually rebounded by about one or two jiao. The trend should first rotate around the overall market and then turn upwards. The meeting situation will surely be smooth, and the great unity will be realized soon. As foreign interest rates slightly ease, the rising trend will naturally arise. Yesterday's market price results showed a decline ranging from one or two jiao to six or seven jiao. The total turnover was 16,651,000. In addition, there were 20 shares of stock. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Mostly Weakening</h3>
<p>According to a report by Sinfeng Foreign Firm, the stock market in the near future seems to be in a state of highly selective. One is based on the hope that each stock will pay dividends. Unless there is substantial progress in spring commerce, speculative stocks may still be unavoidable to lag behind. Therefore, based on the current general concept of focusing on dividends, it is advisable to take the opportunity to buy stocks of companies that distribute most of their profits as dividends. United Tanker is one such example and is worth purchasing. The Ministry of Finance's issuance of new public bonds was oversubscribed by several times the fixed amount, and the investment background of bond is therefore becoming more and more consolidated. With the low interest rate, the abundance of floating capital, and the progress of profit guarantee, the bond price can be strong. High-quality and medium-quality bonds are still a good investment target for steady investors. It is expected that the government will make an important statement on its policy in the next few weeks, and the current doubts and instability will not be difficult to eliminate. Although the business community is worried about the radical elements in next year's Congress, the progress of commerce continues unabated. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<p>|  | 7th | 8th | Change |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 30 Industrial Stocks | 103.16 | 102.82 | Down 0.34 |</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Spot Sales Surge</h3>
<p>—Led by Standard Yarn—</p>
<p>The yarn market was initially sluggish. Due to the softening of the overseas cotton market, and the large-scale purchases of 17-count yarn in Henan Province, as well as the active procurement in the South, people's sentiment suddenly rose, and the market showed prosperity. However, new buyers are still lacking. As the end of the year approaches, transactions are not smooth. However, the yarn received by Tongcheng Company last month has been sold continuously, totaling 1,200 to 1,300 bales of 20-count Fugui Ren Zhong Jincheng yarn.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster up Five, Six, Seven Jiao, Standard Yarn The market opened in the morning, but due to the flatness of foreign cotton, the market sentiment was slightly sluggish, and the prices of each month fell by two or three jiao. When it was auctioned until the third closing, it was heard that the news of spot yarn was good, and the market suddenly turned upward. As a result, each month rose by one, two, and four jiao. In the afternoon, due to the rise in spot yarn in Zhengzhou, Henan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Changsha, and other places, people's sentiment became more and more excited, and the buying trend rose again. Gengfeng resisted shorting 3,550 bales. The market chips were relatively scarce, and the market price rose even more. Each month rose by four or five jiao. It was found that 550 bales of Dafeng were sold, 500 bales of Daji, 1,550 bales of Changji, 600 bales of Shenchang, 2,150 bales of Changfeng, 1,800 bales of Runkang, 1,000 bales of Hengde, 1,000 bales of Yida, and 900 bales of Xincheng. 750 bales of Dafu were bought, 800 bales of Yuda, 750 bales of Dafeng, 1,000 bales of Shenji, 3,550 bales of Gengfeng, 500 bales of Yuanda, 600 bales of Changyu, and 600 bales of Runkang. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are as follows:</p>
<p>| Standard Yarn | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| December | 184.4 | 183.8 | 184.3 | Up 0.60 | 36,050 |</p>

<p>| Total |  |  |  |  | 721,500 |</p>
<p>Yarn sales reached more than 2,000 bales. The sales of spot yarn have greatly improved. It was found that a total of 2,275 bales were bought on the whole day. The prices rose by two and a half jiao to five jiao. The purchase amounts of each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>| Location | Bales | Location | Bales | Location | Bales |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>

<h3>Standard Cotton Closes with Active Short Covering</h3>
<p>The cotton market started to fall and then rose. The spot cotton situation was flat. The US cotton 6th estimate was released with a production volume of 9,731,000 bales, an increase of 97,000 bales compared to the previous estimate. The price rose slightly by one to two pound sterling. Indian cotton fell one rupee and seventy-five, and the gold price tended to fall, causing people's sentiment to be depressed. However, later, as the yarn market turned upward, the cotton market was led up. In the afternoon, some people expected the US cotton to rise, and the buying sentiment increased and rose.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Good Two, Three Jiao, Standard Cotton The market opened in the morning, but US cotton production increased again, Indian cotton fell back, and the gold price fell. The market situation was relatively soft, and the buyers shrank. The prices of each month fell by one or two jiao. When it was auctioned until the third closing, the market suddenly tightened. As the yarn market tended to rise, the cotton market followed suit. As a result, the prices of each month rebounded by one or two jiao. The market opened in the afternoon with a fatigue due to the fall in gold prices, but when it was burdened to the second or third market, the market price became tighter and tighter. Because Gengfeng and Shenchang numbers resisted a large number of shorts, the surface became tight. Therefore, the prices of each month rose by five, one and a half, and two jiao. It was found that 4,800 dan of Yuanda were sold, 1,500 dan of Zhenda, 2,300 dan of Yuande, 1,400 dan of Tongxing, 1,000 dan of Runkang, 2,000 dan of Jinchang, and 2,600 dan of Yichang. 7,100 dan of Gengfeng were bought, 1,000 dan of Dafu, 2,100 dan of Tongji, 1,600 dan of Junchang, 1,700 dan of Changyu, 6,100 dan of Shenchang, 1,000 dan of Runkang, 1,500 dan of Shengyuan, and 1,000 dan of Yifeng. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are as follows:</p>
<p>| Standard Cotton | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| December | 37.00 | 36.65 | 37.00 | Up 0.25 | 136,400 |</p>

<p>| Total |  |  |  |  | 843,600 |</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Trading Not Active. The spot cotton market is still deserted. Factories are not rushing to purchase raw cotton because the ratio of cotton to yarn is not matched. The sources include Yao cotton 780 bales, Tong cotton 900 bales.</p>
<p>| Cotton Type | Price | Details |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Tianjin American Cotton | 56.00 | 700 pieces of spot goods delivered to factories inside and outside the factory |</p>
<p>| Zhangde Cotton | 55.00 | Another 200 pieces, also delivered to factories |</p>
<p>| Lingbao Cotton | 61.50 | Another 83 pieces, also delivered to factories |</p>
<h3>Flour Futures: Activity Among Hoarders</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the price of foreign wheat fluctuated. However, because the price of spot goods was reported to be over five yuan in Australia, the market sentiment was very good, and the hoarders were even more active. Moreover, the price of flour in Yingkou was rumored to be as high as three yuan. Therefore, that gang vigorously covered their positions yesterday, and all factories did not release their stocks. Fuxin even resisted shorting, which caused many floating households to turn short. The hoarders' appetites were particularly active, and the prices of each month rose one after another. The closing price for this month was up two fen and seventy-five, next month and February were up three fen and twenty-five, April was up four fen and a half, March was up four fen, and May was up four fen and seventy-five.</p>
<h3>Strong Buying Interest in Wheat Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign wheat futures fluctuated. The reported price of spot foreign wheat was as high as five yuan, and the spot price of local wheat was therefore speculated by the owners. The price of wheat futures was raised by foreign wheat and local wheat, and the opening price rose immediately. Later, the flour market rose, and the buying interest was even stronger. At the close, this month was up five fen, next month was up seven fen, February was up nine fen, and March was up seven fen. The price of spot wheat rose by seven or eight fen, and 8,000 bags were offered, which were distributed to Fuxin, Fufeng, Xinda, and Shenda. The price of high-grade wheat was four yuan and seven fen, four yuan and four and a half fen, and four yuan, respectively. The price of medium-grade and inferior wheat was three yuan and eight jiao five or six fen.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Siamese Rice Arriving Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>—Spot Foreign Rice Falls, Broken Rice Rises—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation and futures, were mainly handled by local businesses in the city, combined with inquiries from Zhejiang and Jiangxi gangs. The market sentiment was excellent. Although foreign merchants continued to sell and hoarders returned, the price rose by five fen instead. Spot Saigon and Siamese machine rice both had orders being shipped, so the price of spot foreign rice fell by a small number of fen. However, broken foreign rice was competed for by local businesses and for disaster relief, so the price rose sharply for several consecutive days. Yesterday, it rose by another one or two jiao. In particular, Siamese broken rice was even more popular. Ke Xian rice arrivals and sales were both active. Hard rice and red rice were welcomed by local customers, and the arrivals and stocks were scarce. Yesterday, the price rose by nearly one jiao again. Other prices remained stable.</p>
<p>Local rice merchants previously purchased rice stones in Siam and chartered the Gongping Wheel from Gu Xin Yi and the Longshan Wheel from Sanbei Company to Siam for loading, as previously reported. According to a telegram received by the China Merchants Bureau from the Gongping Wheel yesterday, it has returned to Shanghai from Siam and is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. However, the sea surface has been foggy recently, and navigation is inconvenient. It may be delayed for one day, but it is not known. It is estimated that more than 30,000 bags of rice will be loaded. Whether it will be unloaded into the Jinliyuan warehouse or the Pudong Hua warehouse after arriving in Shanghai has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Hexia Rice Price Falls Another Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 30 ships arrived from various gangs, with a total of 4,500 to 600 shi. The market situation declined, and there was a downward trend. However, every time it fell, the sales could move. The Qingdao gang continued to purchase more than 1,000 bags, and the local market was also quite active. The prices of thick japonica rice and late rice all fell by about one jiao. Du Yangjian remained stable, and Yin Bianyuan arrivals were scarce, so it could also turn slightly flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the number of ships arriving from Hexia and inland from various gangs was still small, about 13 or 14 ships. There were nearly 100 ships in He Cun. The sales of various colors in the market, including white japonica rice, Yangjian, Dujian, early thin rice, and odds and ends, were still flat. Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan were also stagnant. Port customers Jian were still good. The market price of white japonica rice was slightly down about one jiao. Early thin rice, Yangdujian port customer, and Jian ping tired. Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan prices fell by a small number of fen.</p>
<h3>Soybean Rising Trend Not Weakening</h3>
<p>Zhongguan Goods Are Particularly Adequate</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market continued the momentum of the previous week, and the trend was still quite active. The abolition of the five-sheng tax in Anhui Province will be difficult to implement within the year. Therefore, the large-scale sources from the Jinpu Guan and Hai customs will have to be delayed. However, the number of soybeans that can be transported by wheel from the Haizhou area is also scarce. The daily statistics are more than 1,000 bags. The sales continue to be active by inland factories. The market sentiment is stable. Although the Dalian market has risen, this city is not affected much because the soybeans are only sold to the export and garden industries. Recently, the sales of these two gangs have been sluggish, so the price of Siping Street soybeans is still four yuan, and the price of Fanjiatun large grains is only four yuan and two jiao and a half. The market price has not followed Dalian and risen wildly. Yesterday, Yingzhou Chen beans opened two warehouses, and the price was three yuan and six jiao and seven fen, which was handled by the Tongzhou Chefang. Guigui New beans traded more than 900 bags, and the price was three yuan and six jiao and three yuan and five jiao and eight fen. The sales were for factories and inland. More than 300 bags of Tancheng beans were sold at a price of three yuan and six jiao, which was purchased by the local merchants. 700 bags of Xin'anzhen beans were sold at a price of three yuan and five jiao, which was for inland sales. 800 bags of Hankou Che beans were opened at a price of three yuan and five jiao and a half and five jiao and three, which were also asked for by inland. More than 2,000 bags of Hankou Zha beans were traded at a price from three yuan three jiao and a half to three jiao and two, which were distributed by local and inland businesses. The market price continued to rise by three or four fen compared to last Saturday, and Zhongguan beans were more adequate than high-quality goods.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: New Chaoqing Is Still Difficult to Lower Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stable with tightening Customs Gold. The publicly allotted price of ordinary No. 24 coarse sand white spot goods was 18.5 yuan, unchanged. The price of the goods in this warehouse was 18.6 yuan, and the price of transshipment goods was 5.2 yuan. Dutch red was slightly tight, and the price of high-quality No. 89 goods rose by three fen to 14.33 yuan, and the ordinary price was called 14 yuan. The price of transshipment goods was 4.9 yuan. The price of the fine white sugar No. 1 from this factory, Zhenyu, was slightly opened in a scattered manner, and was still 17.7 yuan. The price of No. 4 was 17.2 yuan. The price of Taikoo Sugar B mark was called 19.6 yuan. Due to the depletion of the previous goods, the domestic sliced green sugar was in short supply. Yesterday, 222 boxes of small-box sliced green sugar and 107 boxes of medium-box sliced green sugar were opened, all at 10.8 yuan, up three or four jiao. Yesterday, more than 1,000 bags of new Chaoqing arrived on the Fusheng Wheel. The samples may be available roughly today or tomorrow. The industry hopes to lower the price as the arrivals gradually increase. However, although land prices have recently fallen, the Huishui in Shantou has shrunk greatly, and the price of only 965 yuan to Shanghai is still difficult to pass. The brokers are temporarily unwilling to sell cheaply due to cost factors. Therefore, the price is soft and hard, and the market has a tendency to stabilize.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: The Land Price of Fungus Fluctuated Sharply</h3>
<p>Longkou Noodles Rise Another Four Jiao</p>
<p>At the beginning of last week, the price of fungus in Hankou rose by five or six yuan. Unexpectedly, the price suddenly fell again after one week. According to a telegram from Hankou yesterday, the price of Xing'an River Mouth goods fell to 81.6 yuan, and the price of Gaoyan fungus fell to 82.6 yuan, a decrease of four or five yuan compared to the beginning of last week. Therefore, the Shanghai market followed suit. The price of Dingsheng's top-notch aviation brand small-packaged fungus yesterday was 95 yuan, which also fell by three or four yuan. The market is expected to continue to be loose. Due to the tightening of land prices, the sales of Longkou vermicelli have not moved much in Shanghai, but the sales prices have also gradually risen. Yesterday, the price of South Shanghai standard sales was 21 yuan, and the price of North Shanghai standard sales was 22 yuan. According to a telegram from Longkou, the price per bag has risen to 28.2 yuan, a further increase of four jiao compared to before. After that, the winter sales will be strong, and the production will not be able to continue due to the cold weather on the ground. The stock will inevitably become scarcer and scarcer, and there is no possibility of turning loose.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Jiaxing Has Poor Harvest, Hankou Has Shortage, and New Asphalt Sales Prices Soar</h3>
<p>The new asphalt production is always the latest in western Hubei, Jingzhou, and Zhijiang. Therefore, the new oil arrives in Hankou after the winter solstice. However, Macheng oil is closer to Hankou, and it arrives in Hankou earlier. However, the body is softer and not suitable for candle making. Therefore, the candle making workshops in this city rely entirely on Zhejiang oil for supply, especially the Ben Che asphalt in Jiaxing area of western Zhejiang, which is the most suitable. The land is adjacent and can be transported by car. It arrives in the evening after early departure. Therefore, in previous years, there were thousands of pieces of Zhejiang Heben oil available after the light snow. With this huge supply, of course, no attention is paid to Han oil. However, this year's Jiaxing is a major disaster year, and statistics show that only 20% to 30% can be harvested. If it is calculated on the basis of last year, 30,000 pieces of Heben asphalt can be produced in winter, but this winter's budget is only 7,000 pieces, which is only a little more than 20% compared to last winter. I am only afraid that the local sales will not be enough, so I cannot transport it to Shanghai. It is also heard that Jing oil is being transported to Zhejiang for sale from Hankou and Shanghai to make up for the lack of Heben. And the Shanghai market has to purchase and apply from Han. In the era of alternating new and old oil, the new oil has not arrived, and the number of old oil stocks has been thin. Suddenly, it was snapped up by various gangs such as Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Jiaxing, which has a sudden upsurge. The demand exceeds the supply, and the market soars. Heavy Jing oil jumped from 9 liang and 8 qian to 11 liang and 45 qian, and Macheng oil increased from 9 liang and 6 qian to 10 liang and 8 qian. There is no spot goods available. All the transactions are on-road goods. After this action, the stocks were completely sold out, and the stocks held by the local merchants were also few. It is heard that there are no spot goods available in Hankou, and the sales prices have to be raised sharply. The current market price for heavy Jing oil is 19 yuan per shi, and the price for Ping Jing is 18.4 yuan. The oil market price in Macheng is 17 yuan. According to the calculation, the cost of Ben Che from Jiaxing to Shanghai is about 21 yuan, so it is far from suitable.</p>
<h3>Hardware: The Factory Price of Round Nails is Slightly Loose</h3>
<p>Recently, the factory sales of this factory's round nails have been very excited due to the interruption of the source of goods from the east and west, and the transactions have been unusually considerable. The sales in the Yangtze River area, the inland river gangs, and Fujian and Zhejiang are very good. The business in the north is weaker due to the collision of goods from the east. Other practical users all regard this as the only popular product. Therefore, the business of this factory's nails in this city is very good. However, the selling price is mutually lowered due to the establishment of too many nail factories (there are currently seven or eight companies starting production). Therefore, the standard price has been loosened repeatedly, and the recent secret market is even softer. It is heard that the market price is 5.75 yuan per barrel, while the secret market price is only 5.6 yuan (but it is limited to large transactions), a drop of 1.2 yuan compared to the opening price in the spring.</p>

<p>Idle Talk</p>
<h3>On "Allusion" and "Plagiarism"</h3>
<p>— Danran</p>
<p>The Chinese are the most adept at "allusion" of all peoples. Those who brew wine must find Marshal Du Kang, and carpenters must find the Immortal Master Lu Ban as their founders. It seems they cannot work in peace without something they can boast of as their "single line of succession." This is one example. Today, someone initiates an anti-superstition convention, and I can move a great many words to the podium. Tomorrow, someone holds a peace prayer meeting, and I can still give a "coherent" lecture. This is another example. However, these are still common social phenomena, and people generally are not surprised. If we pay a little attention, everything becomes laughable. I can point out another laughable phenomenon that is generally overlooked: the "allusion" of men of letters.</p>
<p>Men of letters cannot withstand the driving force of "fame," so they inevitably have to find ways to show off. However, our esteemed nation is a particularly antiquarian one. Those who love the ancient naturally despise the "now," and naturally want to "earnestly seek" from the "ancient." Thus, they must "allude" in every way possible, and find ways to find their "single line of succession." If you want specific examples, I can recommend that you go to a magazine company and browse for ten minutes. If you cannot find an example there, I can take responsibility for the deception.</p>
<p>"Plagiarism" and "allusion" are related. If you do not have goods, if you do not have ivory in your mouth, then presenting ancient and elegant scraps to readers who love the ancient is the supreme method. We have "heritage," and we can "search forward" with all our might. We do not worry about not having materials, and we do not worry about not gaining fame and fortune. If someone does not know what is good for them and wants to raise objections, then I can guarantee that you will encounter the number one ancient shield, and I guarantee that you will not be able to bear it.</p>
<p>If you love the ancient frankly, we will easily see it. If you are a young person, you will scold him as an "antique" and "stubborn." But if you encounter people who hold up the smokescreen of "organizing heritage," you will definitely say they "contribute to culture." So, everything requires methods. For example, some people's nude photography is vulgar, while other people's nude photography is art. If you understand this point, you will understand everything in this society.</p>
<p>Those who "allude" and "plagiarize" will "act as if something important is happening," release a smokescreen, and even "make rare things available," scaring young men. Although some people will find it "tasteless as chewing wax," they will feel goosebumps.</p>
<h3>Group Wedding</h3>
<p>— Youqi</p>
<p>Marriage is a troublesome matter. Not to mention the various problems after marriage that can exhaust you to death, even to the point of suicide. Even the preparations for the wedding and the holding of the ceremony can make you dizzy and spin around in circles.</p>
<p>But humans have this strange trait: whether before or after marriage, they know there will be all kinds of trouble, but when they reach a certain age, they still have to hold one, as if the trouble is fine, but the event still needs to be held. The reason is the establishment of a "family." In the eyes of modern people, if you do not hold one, it is secondary to yourself, but you cannot avoid being looked down upon, especially for poor people.</p>
<p>However, it is indeed too difficult to hold one. This era is shrouded in the poisonous atmosphere of capital. Marriages between the two sexes have also become somewhat commercialized.</p>
<p>In a capitalist society, money is the most important component. With this white and shiny weapon, it is easy to solve anything. However, these days are too depressed. How many people truly have the power?</p>
<p>Therefore, many people are shouting: "Advocate thrifty weddings!"</p>
<p>What is the response? We know that before this old latent power disappears, before the traditional concepts created by customs and habits are eradicated, the efficiency is very limited, extremely thin.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>If we pay attention to the advertisements in the newspaper, we can often see notices like this:</p>
<p>······We two have now progressed from friendship to lovers. We are scheduled to marry on a certain month and day. However, the national crisis is serious, and all cumbersome ceremonies will be simplified.······</p>
<p>Here, the so-called "national crisis" is, frankly speaking, "money crisis." Although this method has its own value, the grand occasion of a large banquet is inevitable, and who dares to say that the parties involved do not also want to have fun?</p>
<p>Now, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is initiating new life group weddings, gathering a number of couples who are preparing to marry and holding the ceremony together on a scheduled date, four times a year. Moreover, they are using the City Hall auditorium as the wedding hall, and the mayor and the director of the Social Affairs Bureau are acting as witnesses. This is enough of a grand occasion on the whole, and the fixed cost of the wedding is ten yuan per person, which is also sufficient to cope with economically.</p>
<p>We hope that this emerging method can be implemented as soon as possible, and can be gradually promoted to declare war on extravagant weddings!</p>
<h3>The Sorrow of a Camel</h3>
<p>— A Ping</p>
<p>There are no clouds in the sky, and the bright moon shines on the earth. It is quiet in the thatched house. Apart from the whistling of the night wind blowing through the reeds, the world seems to be dead. I am lonely, abandoned by this world; although my sympathetic owner, he occupied me because he wanted to profit from me. So every day he leads me to those roads that I am not used to walking on, to see those people I am not familiar with, making me a clown for people's amusement. Sometimes, for his business, I often suffer the blows of stones from naughty children. Naturally, generally speaking, there is also indirect benefit to me after the owner's pocket is warm and full, but I would rather do heavy work in my hometown, I cannot deceive myself as a puppet! It is said that there are many ways to tell fortunes, why did my owner think of calling on me alone? Or am I born too ugly, but humans love beauty, and the advertising of any industry must take beauty as a major premise. The little birds with red heads in the same line are for this reason, isn't that bird quite fun? I do not meet this condition, a furry long face, with a hunchback as annoying as an old man, and the way I walk is not beautiful, where do I start talking about this, but I bear the responsibility of advertising. However, it is a fact that many businesses are buying my furry face. Is there no fixed standard for human love of beauty? Thinking about it, there are special reasons, a tall person who exceeds the ordinary size is already worth admiring by his kind, let alone I am called a "beast"! Therefore, the owner's care for me is not as noble as his actions. Alas, I am lonely, I have left my hometown, left my companions, acting as the owner's puppet, acting as a plaything for the masses, I want to ask the owner to tell my fortune, can I be reborn in my next life? This is what I heard when doing business, people are asking what their next life will be like.</p>
<p>Today, I met old geese during the day. Since I came to this strange world, it was the first time I saw friends from my hometown. But the owner's business is important, and we had no room to say a word. We cannot enjoy the right to "meeting an old acquaintance in a foreign land"? I cannot help but hate my owner. If I were in my hometown, if I were insulted like this, I would definitely jump up bravely, pull open my legs, and duel with the enemy until he surrendered. My hometown is truly great, tens of millions of miles of boundless desert, where I charge into battle. Although our kind are also kept by the owners, we do not distinguish between "people" and "beasts," we help each other and live together, dealing with all environments. Sometimes we cannot find water and grass for days and nights, but we still try our best to move forward, and the wind in the northern border blows on us like arrows, we do not flinch, that kind of dauntless spirit is worth being proud of. But now I have been brought to Shanghai, which is known as the largest city in China. I am being played with, and because I am lying in this narrow surroundings, I have lost all freedom and become the owner's slave. I curse why humans cruelly abuse us like this, one day I will develop my authority and return to my hometown to live our own lives!</p>
<p>Now the fields are even more silent, the old geese should come to tell me some news from my hometown at this time, is the old owner well, are the companions well, is the hometown well? Looking up to the north, there is a glow of neon lights rushing into the sky, this metropolis is always surrounded by a colorful atmosphere, the old geese come here every time, I do not know for what, is it that the hometown cannot stand either? I am lonely, I have been abandoned by this world!</p>
<h3>Child</h3>
<p>— Julie</p>
<p>My wife has been in the examination room for a long time and has not come out yet. My heart feels like snakes are crawling on it. I am smoking and pacing in the waiting room. Our hope has been completely handed over to the doctor. As long as he diagnoses the result, we are like waiting for the judge's verdict.</p>
<p>There are more and more patients in the waiting room. My bored and impatient gaze swept across each of their faces, and I felt that illness was something that belonged to the poor; but the poor cannot afford to be sick! So I kept staring at the glass window of the examination room until my wife came out and the next number was called in.</p>
<p>There was a layer of fog-like sadness on my wife's face. I knew that the doctor had sentenced us to death. She slowly walked to me, without saying a word, and took my arm to walk out.</p>
<p>We left the hospital without exchanging a word, but everyone understood. What words to start with? This seemed to be an ironclad fact?</p>
<p>When we got home, the child jumped out of the servant's arms to hug my wife, and then I saw a trace of a smile on her face. This is a manifestation of instinct. Every parent loves their children like that. So why are they distressed about the arrival of a second child!</p>
<p>When my wife was first pregnant, it was already five years after we got married. She often missed it, saying that we should have a child. When she saw other people's children, she would snatch them to hug. Even the photos of baby competitions, she would cut out and hang in the mirror frame on the wall as treasures. So when the doctor diagnosed that she was indeed pregnant, she jumped up and down like a little sparrow, preparing everything after the child's birth. Like an elderly woman, she was so thoughtful, so cautious, and guessed that the future child would be like me, like her.</p>
<p>To be honest, this is what I expected too, but not as eagerly as she did. I felt that our small family was too lonely without a child, and after being married for five years, it seemed that there should be a child to decorate our lives. Sure enough, a child was born, and he was as lovely as we had imagined, with a round face and fat fists.</p>
<p>But following this joy, we were surrounded by a kind of oppression, which was the child's upbringing expenses. Our income, generally speaking, was still relatively generous, but since this child joined our small family, he has just turned three years old, and he has already occupied a considerable amount on our expense list. This is something we had never thought of before. Sometimes, we often quarreled over the child's expenses, and then came a feeling, how will we raise him when he grows up? This responsibility is on the shoulders of the parents. So although the child himself is lovely, many innocent children are sacrificed under these circumstances for this reason. Naturally, we are unwilling to do this, but the signs of the arrival of the second child do not allow you to bear his natural growth. At first, we hoped that this sign was just a sign, but time does not wait for people. Two months passed, and we were worried that this sign would be confirmed. But the heart that cherished the child was still consistent. From her usual tone, she hoped to have another daughter, but the economic chains were clearly that we could no longer have children. How did this sign scare us!</p>
<p>The result of the discussion, the doctor's diagnosis, this is just a one-in-a-million hope. Now this hope has been completely shattered, and a lovely enemy will join this harmonious little family. I looked at the child's joyful state in my mother's arms, and I could not help but worry about his future.</p>
<h3>In Illness</h3>
<p>— Li Ping</p>
<p>I received your third letter in illness! Ah Lin, the Ying you are concerned about is now seriously ill: ah! Although my body temperature is very high, I do not want to cruelly forget the love you gave me, and that you are waiting for my news in the distance. However, Ah Lin, you will know that the vicious doctor will not allow me to write letters no matter what! I am just struggling to get up in pain, suffering the nurses' prohibitions three or four times.</p>
<p>In fact, Ah Lin, I have simply lost the strength to write! My hands are terribly thin, Ah Lin, I can guess correctly, if you saw my thin hands, you would definitely cry non-stop. But you have to believe me, no, my spirit is very healthy. Ah Lin, since the second day of our little baby's birth, I have been ill for forty or fifty days, and I owe the hospital money. The accountant comes to urge me every day, but what can I give them?</p>
<p>You should know that a pregnant woman, as her body grows bigger every day: how can she continue to work more than ten hours a day as usual? I have stopped working, and it has been almost six weeks.</p>
<p>Whenever I am in great pain from the illness, I often silently mutter in grief.</p>
<p>- Come back - You, where are you! You are the one who can cure my illness! ...... Heaven! Where have you taken my beloved? Ah - I am shouting like this, of course you will not hear it; can</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>But the patients in the same room sigh for my madness. Our sister Chun wipes away my tears non-stop.</p>
<p>- Do not be like this! Sister Ying, - Sister Chun always comforts me with a crying voice. - You should know that you have a husband who left you for the future of mankind, he cannot abandon his mission to take care of a sick wife, let alone he does not know that you are sick.</p>
<p>I stared blankly at his trembling lips. She continued:</p>
<p>- You should think like this: you should forgive your husband with pain! - I had to hide my head and cry to my heart's content. Ah! So I cannot be so childishly attached to you!</p>
<p>Today I reread your letter twice: every time I read it, a new kindness heavily presses on my heart. Only your every word can comfort my soul and make my faith in you stronger.</p>
<p>In your letter, I yearn for the scenery of a foreign land. You tell me that you are very healthy; however, I can imagine that your body is very tired, but your spirit is very happy. Because I believe that your career will give you unlimited comfort. However, our separation will make you feel very painful; but this personal trauma will never harm your great spirit. My Ah Lin! I know that we can fight for society and put love aside; we cannot wait for the imperialists to slaughter us under the flowers and the moon! What's more, your wife is sincerely waiting for your success. This love's encouragement can at least give you considerable excitement.</p>
<p>Furthermore: we are a young couple, and even more companions in distress; we should encourage our passion forward! How can I make you give up a greater cause for me?</p>
<p>Dear Ah Lin! We must always be firm in our faith and will.</p>
<p>But, Ah Lin! I still longed for you to return immediately when I was sick. Now, I have soberly overcome my emotions, and you should know that it is pathological and not worth your sadness. Do you know? A revolutionary fighter cannot be sad. So why do you tell you the truth? You know, this is my sincerity to you that cannot be hidden.</p>
<p>The doctor is advising me not to be too sentimental and to stop writing. I wish you success!</p>

<h3>The Prosperous Architecture of Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>— Yan Ming</p>
<p>The importance of "architecture" in modern nations is clear to anyone with a basic understanding of modern knowledge. "Architecture" is not only a symbol of a nation's strength but also the "lifeline" of the entire nation's life. This publication has already provided numerous articles discussing the importance of architecture and raising public awareness of its significance. However, what we currently see is that the general urban populace, and even the entire nation, blindly praises urban prosperity. If asked why cities are prosperous and the close relationship between urban prosperity and architecture, they are simply ignorant and unaware. Therefore, it is still imperative to practically elucidate the relationship between architecture and urban prosperity to enhance the understanding of urban prosperity among urban residents and the entire nation.</p>
<p>For now, let's set aside political stances and purely from a technical perspective, discuss how Soviet Russia's prosperity and architecture are related. "Borrowing a stone from another mountain to correct one's own mistakes" might not be entirely useless for us.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that Soviet Russia has become increasingly stable since implementing its two Five-Year Plans. In Soviet Russia, both urban and rural areas are increasingly heading towards prosperity, contrasting sharply with the growing economic panic in European and American countries. We know that eighteen years ago, Moscow and Leningrad could barely be considered major world cities. However, they have now leapt to become some of the world's leading metropolises. Based on the current situation, they may even surpass London and New York in the near future. Why has Soviet Russia been able to progress so rapidly since the revolution? Why have Soviet Russian metropolises been able to independently move towards prosperity? The explanation for these questions lies entirely in "architecture." First, we must know that the late revolutionary leader of Soviet Russia, Lenin, once said: "Urban architecture plus electrification plus the Soviets equals socialism." The Soviet government accepted Lenin's statement, and during the First Five-Year Plan, the entire nation dedicated itself to construction. Needless to say, construction mainly includes architectural projects. Furthermore, it can be said that architecture and construction are one and the same. Now, let's look at the actual achievements of Soviet Russia's construction in terms of architecture. Since the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan, the development of steel and heavy industry, the expansion of military industrial departments, and the rapid expansion of the gas and electricity industries have been achieved. With the concentrated efforts of domestic and foreign architects and engineering designers, over 900 factories for the aforementioned industries have been completed. The area around Lake Baikal in Siberia, formerly known as a wasteland, is now one of the centers of heavy industry, and the establishment of heavy industrial plants in the construction zone is countless. At the same time, Soviet Russia not only increased the number of factories in the industrial sector but also achieved the highest standards in factory construction technology. It has raised immature, small-scale technologies to new, advanced levels, preparing for further social construction. The achievements of Soviet Russia in industrial and architectural technology that most surprise European and American entrepreneurs are the great designs of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, the Stalin Gas Factory, and the Lenin Steel Factory. In terms of light industry, Soviet Russia's cotton textile factories, silk factories, textile factories, and all other light industrial sectors are also developing at the same speed, reaping tremendous benefits. All of this should first be attributed to architects, engineering designers, and countless construction workers. The vast achievements in factory construction have improved production capacity and ensured the stability of the lives of a large number of workers. In terms of agriculture, the First Five-Year Plan focused on concentrating scattered small-scale farming into vast collective farms and state-owned farms. Regarding the expansion of collective farms and state-owned farms, in just two years, 200,000 new collective farms and 5,000 new state-owned farms were newly built. These agricultural construction achievements have never been seen before in architectural history. Because these large-scale farms were built, productivity is stronger, and harvests are richer. The achievements in transportation infrastructure are no less than those in industry and agriculture. Since the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan, the extension of railway construction in Soviet Russia has increased to more than one and a half times the original amount. At the same time, the construction of new roads and new heavy-tonnage bridges is also on par with the United States.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the cultural construction of Soviet Russia, reflecting economic development, is expressed in education. Every school, whether specialized or not, is established for the economic construction of Soviet Russia—the Second Five-Year Plan. Almost nine out of ten students graduating from schools each year are architects or engineering designers, responsible for guiding workers to build and consolidate Soviet Russia for the Second Five-Year Plan.</p>
<p>After seeing the actual construction achievements of Soviet Russia and their increasing prosperity, which are all created by Soviet architects and engineering designers leading workers, concentrating their efforts, and first focusing on "architecture," we should not only admire the success of Soviet Russia's construction or praise the greatness of Soviet Russia's construction. The main thing is that we should understand why they can achieve construction success? Why can they independently move towards the road of prosperity while other countries are going in the opposite direction? All of this is because their entire nation has modern architectural knowledge and can work practically to create today's achievements. Otherwise, instead of hearing news of rural bankruptcy, we see the deformed development of cities. Without actual construction, China's cities and rural areas will never prosper. At the very least, if the entire nation can understand the importance of architecture and its need in modern nations, then architecture may gradually become widespread in China as well.</p>

<p>— Ya Jie</p>
<p>On January 28, 1932, the Japanese Navy Land Forces provoked our defending forces on the pretext. Our side vowed not to yield and engaged them, leading to an unprecedented major war. Shanghai, a prosperous place and a commercial district, suddenly became a battlefield. The critical situation and fierce fighting were expected. Fortunately, our brave soldiers, such as the 19th Route Army and the 5th Route Army, fought valiantly, repelling the enemy and inflicting heavy blows. This excited and inspired the people of the country, changed international perceptions, and made the imperialist aggressors know that the Chinese nation indeed had good men. After the Japanese army suffered defeat, they repeatedly sent generals and mobilized troops, reversing their former belief that we were easy to deceive and striving to resist. Therefore, the fierceness of the fighting and the tragic circumstances were unprecedented. In particular, the battle of the 5th Route Army at Miaohangzhen, annihilating the enemy and killing the bandits, was the most intense and tragic. Both sides suffered countless sacrifices. As we approach the third anniversary of the January 28th Incident, should we not remember the sacrificing soldiers who fought for the nation's survival and the glory of the nation? Should we not shed a tear of sympathy to celebrate their undying spirit, and bury them to comfort the martyrs in the afterlife? Therefore, the preliminary idea of building a tomb for unknown heroes in Miaohangzhen, the battlefield, to show long-term remembrance and not to forget, arose.</p>
<p>Today, the cave that was destroyed by the war has been flattened. The trees that were ravaged by the war and aircraft have been replanted, and the atmosphere is new. The green grass, once trampled by countless soldiers and withered by the passage of tanks, has now regained its fresh green color, revealing its true face. Today, will anyone who visits the war zone and mourns the battlefield be able to see the desolate and ruined scenes after the war? The glory of the soldiers should be recorded in history, to be immortalized, to encourage the past, and to plan for the future. The relics of the soldiers should be deeply ingrained in people's hearts, the impression indelible, never to be forgotten. Those countless unknown heroes who shed blood and sweat on the grass will never be forgotten, representing the spirit of Chinese men. Understanding this, the construction of the hero's tomb by our national authorities is not without reason. The remnants of Miaohang have already been cleared, and the construction of the tomb of unknown heroes is currently underway. The completion and unveiling ceremony has been decided on the third anniversary of the January 28th Incident. The tomb's ground is shaped like a sword, and the memorial hall is built of pure granite. The hall is a rectangular solid, with a door opened in front, reached by climbing stone steps. Upon entering, one sees a spring in the center of the hall. In the spring, there is a stone coffin, indicating the resting place of the unknown heroes. The four walls of the hall are filled with commemorative charts, commemorating the detailed facts of the joint resistance against Japan by the 19th Route Army and the 5th Route Army, intending to inspire the masses, promote the spirit of heroes, swallow mountains and rivers, soar with ambition, and spread their names for thousands of years. At the lower end of the tomb site is a large gate, accompanied by a guard post and a garden.</p>
<p>If you follow the main road to visit this memorial building, you will see its elegance and tranquility from afar, with deeply shaded trees and a glimpse of the sword-shaped land and a magnificent building. The garden is filled with trees, flowers, and fruits. A visit along the path is particularly interesting. This memorial hall, with only building materials such as granite, green stone, steel bones, cement, steel, and iron, has already cost 100,000 yuan. Other expenses are not yet included. Fortunately, the amount of donations is considerable, which is suitable for strengthening the decoration and making it more spectacular. It is said that the designer is the engineer who planned the Greater Shanghai Plan.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Bank's New Building Completed</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Construction cost: 200,000 yuan</p>
<p>Designed by architect Li Jinping</p>
<p>The area around Jiangxi Road in this city is lined with banks, known as New York's Wall Street. Pedestrians passing through this area are often unable to resist stopping to admire the magnificent and towering buildings, and they can't help but sigh with admiration. Now, the new building of the Shanghai branch of Guangdong Bank has also been completed, shining brilliantly and majestically, adding a lot of color to Jiangxi Road. From now on, pedestrians passing through it will be even more envious.</p>
<p>The new building began construction in February and has now been completely completed, which is one month earlier than the completion date stipulated in the contract. The efforts of the construction factory are evident here. Although the building has been completed, all the documents and books of the bank must be moved in at the end of this month. The total cost of the new building is more than 200,000 yuan, making it a fully artistic modern building. It occupies an area of about half a mu and is located at the northwest corner of Ningbo Road and Jiangxi Road. The main entrance and the high tower on the roof face southeast, towards Nanjing Road. The second and mezzanine floors of the new building are for the bank's own use, and the remaining six floors are planned to be rented to general businesses that want to set up offices in the central district. The interior floors of the bank are all paved with high-quality 12-inch square wood, with Belgian black marble edges. The walls are completely paneled with gray stone from the floor to six feet high, and from six feet to the ceiling, they are decorated with California paint, matching the paneling perfectly. The counters are also made of light red Carrara wood, with Belgian black marble countertops. The ceiling is decorated with gold paint, equipped with indirect lighting, which is elegant and magnificent. The new building was contracted by Jiang Yutai Construction Factory, and the installation of lead pipes and hot steam was contracted by Lengji Electric Refrigerator Company. Rosend Yangxing was responsible for the electrical installation, and Ge Liedao Steel Window Company installed the steel windows and doors. Other equipment, such as the elevator, was supplied by Wodes, the marble project was handled by Bierde Marble Factory, the imported hardware equipment was contracted by Shenchang Yangxing, and the domestic hardware equipment was contracted by Ruichang Hardware Factory on Sanma Road in this city. The Derbaude safe, which was installed, was contracted by Xintong Company. The exterior stonework of the new building was handled by China Stone Company, and the copper and iron projects were also contracted by famous factories. The new building was designed by architect Li Jinping, and Lennars of Shenchang Yangxing was the consulting engineer.</p>
