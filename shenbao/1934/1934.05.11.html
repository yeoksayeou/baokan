<h3 id="c3">第十一章　結論　（對於國聯技術合作辦法之建議） <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>一、上文已將國聯各技術機關、參加合作之事業、作一槪括之陳述、文内往往述及各外籍專家之報告、因而對於國聯各機關於中國建設工作、究能有何貢獻一節、或致引起讀者之誤會、查外籍專家在華服務、其工作之效果究屬有限、彼等不但須灼知事實、且須了解事實之眞實意義、及其相互間之關係、彼等之在中國、平日所到之處極少、又以不諳言語、鮮能與民衆接觸、區膜之處、自所難免、且外籍專家備受中國同僚禮遇、因而對於彼等代爲搜集材料、翻譯文件之辛勞、反不能完全明瞭、又每一事業範圍之内、因各地風俗習尙之不同、益以社會演進中各時期之差别、倘外籍專家僅恃其在本國所得之經騐、以應付此複雜而特殊之任務、良非易易、是以各專家除其本國外、更須具有對他國之智識與經騐、至中國行政及技術人員任務之艱巨、尤非身歷者不能道也、</p>
<p>二、中國政府臨時聘任外籍專家爲顧問、或延至各行政及技術機關服務之事、常常有之、現在外員之數、已不在少、將來工業發展、技術幹部、更將擴大、或尙須增聘、吾人於此固不欲貿然提議、將現行聘用外員、經由國聯技術合作代表推薦之辦法修改、然此項辦法、是否適宜、亦成問題、差外籍專家之在華服務者、已類别紛歧、政府各部各國立機關及省政府當局、又常經由素所熟稔之公私機關介紹、以延聘適當之人員、以此凡經國聯轉聘之人員、每自以爲與國聯有不成文之關係、又或以爲任期中、應享有特别條件、凡此種種、皆足以增重國聯之責任、而此種責任、或非國聯行政院樂於承受者也、</p>
<p>三、凡國聯負責派遣之專家、均有其特殊任務、國聯亦願接受中國政府繼續派遺專家之請求、及關於一九三四年擴充技術合作計畫之提議、猶憶一九三一年全國經濟委員會成立時、中國政府曾與國聯秘書長商妥、於國聯經濟財政兩組、及全國經濟委員會間維持永久之連絡、並交換統計及其他報告、今技術合作已達新階段、則維持此項連絡及連絡之組織、尤有及早實現之必要、</p>
<p>余敬向國聯秘書長提議、請擴大駐華技術連絡員之經費預算、（包括國聯行政院技術代表辦事處）（註）</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會之審議委員會、專任經濟研究及設計事宜、以中央研究院總幹事、本會秘書長、地質調查所所長等組織之、已如上述、此審議委員會、則可依照一九三一年之恊議、按時向技術代表辦事處索取報告、現在全國經濟委員會已指定若干問題、從事研究、以冀有具體之計畫、此際如能由國聯財政經濟兩組輪流派遣高級職員一人、駐在南京、自必爲全國經濟委員會所深願、</p>
<p>（註）本辦事處經於一九三三年十一月與國聯秘書長商酌、定名爲國聯派駐全國經濟委員會技術合作代表辦事處、</p>
<p>國聯技術機關派遣之專家、其任務自當以討論某種或某組有明白規定之問題爲限、然於討論之前、必先在中國作精密之調查及研究、此項調查研究工作、似應由中國行政技術學術等機關或私人專家任之、倘能於外籍專家尙未起程之前、先由相當人員將必要文件携送日内瓦、俾各外籍專家於東行途中、已可進行若干工作、則彼等在華任職之期、亦可酌量縮减也、交由外籍專家討論之事項、固應以與擬辦事業有關者爲限、而外籍專家人選、尤爲重要、非負國際盛譽者不能勝任也、</p>
<p>當此事業進行之際、國聯技術代表時期自須有較長之任職、此項代表、須於其本國外、更富有國際經騐、而對於所代表之國際機關、尤當明瞭其辦事程序、蓋以事業發展、局面形勢、隨之變遷、就地考察變遷之跡、惟技術代表是賴、是以各技術代表當首先與國際技術方面、保持必要之連絡、而後可期合作之成功、中國同僚亦宜乘此機會、儘量利用外籍人員之所長、共同設計、早見實行、</p>
<p>四、中國各技術專家類皆不務虚譽、努力奉公、辦理各項事業皆進行不息、以期其成、中國建設之成功、可爲預料、彼等在國内已飽嘗災患及戰爭之苦、而遇有重大事故、又感國際合作辦法鮮生實效、故皆能不爲政治之邪説流言所動、而一意從事於積極發展之工作、亦有孜孜計畫、以求於現在環境之下、用盡善之法、以振興本國者、彼等雖有眞實之技術知識、其背景蓋半得之於中國、半得之於國外、且對於世界各大國經濟組織之運用、亦嘗悉心研究、故於泰西公衆企業、財政、經濟、實業、農業等應用之道、及外國社會政策、每恃爲基歴之哲理、多有異常之心得、此則或爲世人所不及料者、簡言之、具有必不可少之專家知識、又能了解其本人之技術需要、且洞悉中國應有之改良或革新方式者、如此人才、在中國並不爲少、除特殊專家之事數種外、此等人物及後起之流輩、在有利形况之下、皆足應付緊急事變而有餘、惜乎其中僅有少數人士、曾負行政之責、又彼等於列强所遭之難題、及列强應付之方式、雖大抵知之甚確、且有時其所知更復透澈、然除特别少數外、彼等未有機會能在國外參加公務生活、工業經營、或實施經濟政策之練習也、</p>
<p>五、國聯技術機關之組織與章程、頗具伸縮之性、正可利用之以補充合作方法、至多派中國專家赴外國考察一節、亟應注意、現華人在海外與外人相接者、僅外交官吏及熟諳外國語言之知識界名人而已、此後宜使多數經濟界及服務公職之重要人員、與外人有技術上接洽、而接洽方法、尤須有所規定、國聯秘書處及國際勞工局、均富有獨具之資料、及特别之技術經騐、十四年來歐州常要過渡時間、歐戰前之政治經濟社會制度、逐漸演進、以適合於今日之新局勢、其一切材料經騐、頗足供人取用也、中國之參預此變化演進、視各國爲尤深切、一九一一、一九二五及一九二七年三度革命、卽爲大變遷中之步驟、始則爲陳舊之政制、外交、與經濟事業社會生活及敎育制度之脱離、今則經濟及財政之發展、社會之變遷、政治之趨勢、正在覓一締構之新法、其中若干事實、並詳前文、是以今日國聯應供備一切便利、以使中國與各國機關中技術上負責人員密切連絡、俾對於經濟事業及經濟與社會改革、謀實行之道、而技術合作之功效乃見、至此項中外職員之聯絡、其具體方式如下、</p>
<p>（一）依國聯秘書處及國際勞工局職員之指導、並藉其經騐、以有系統及有計盡的方法、利用該兩機關所有之擋案、</p>
<p>（二）國際淸理銀行秘書處、各項經濟及設計委員會之秘書處及歐美其他同類之機關、亦可供給同樣之便利、</p>
<p>（三）國聯及國際勞工山之技術委員會及分委員會、皆應在其開會之期、及具體研究之際、就具有上述資格與興趣之華人中、邀請專家實地參考焉、</p>
<p>（四）有關中國建設之技術問題、可委託國外著名之經濟及工業研究機關、爲之試騐研究、仍約定以中國專家參與之、至詳細辦法、則視研究調查之性質而定、</p>
<p>（五）國聯衛生組已爲中國政府高等技術人員供給便利、使在同類之機關、獲得特别經騐、此法如能推行於其他方面、獲益尤多、</p>
<p>（六）中國敎育部、近向國聯文化合作會提議之關於指導中國留學生學業辦法、倘發展適宜、亦自成爲要務、</p>
<p>爲此余請會同國聯各技術機關及國際勞工局、將關於各類問題、及各類個别經騐之適當辦法、加以考核、俾技術顧問委員會、及勞工局、得有依據、以便提出具體之建設、</p>
<p>六、全國經濟委員會最近决定一九三四年份之事業進行計畫、並規定事業費爲一千五百萬元、是本年之事業費、已三倍於前兩年所用之費、政府選定辦理建設區域内之各省府、當可得相當之鼓勵與援助、而選定之經濟設施、亦已有軌道可循、是則堅固之基礎旣定、全國經濟發展之機關、則肇基於此矣、是卽三年前政府設立全國經濟委員會之始願也、三年之間、國内國外形勢、均極嚴重、該會爲適應環境顧全事實之故、必須使其組織、富有彈性、逐漸演進、以達於適當之地位、養成行政能力、全國經濟委員會之常務委員、現以政府最重要之各當局充之、旣須綜核研究設計、又須負籌欵之責、至於中國與國聯技術合作辦法、亦由常務委員會决定、而技術合作之原則、并不限於全國經濟委員會所補助辦理、或直接辦理之事業、卽其他部會所辦技術事業之合作、亦可由常務委員定其辦法、</p>
<p>七、技術合作應繼續以一九三一年所訂、及一九三三年續訂之恊定爲根據、其實行方法、固以不背國聯技術機關之組織爲範圍、尤應具有伸縮性、俾得依當今經濟政治上之不時變化、視情形需要而確定之、至於技術合作之目的、則在使中外技術機關恊力合作、同時并鞏固中國發展經濟機關之基礎及權能也、</p>

<h3 id="c8">論阿剌伯半島上之戰爭 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>二旬以前。外電卽傳漢志葉門之間。發生戰事。嗣後消息沈寂。未見有何動靜。但據近數日報載。葉門已爲漢志戰敗。卽其首都。亦將被圍。可知雙方之戰。自開始迄今。未嘗稍息。現在則已達於决勝之階段矣。其消息所以一時沈寂者。因爲前數日世人正注目於性較重要之遠東問題。而無餘暇以顧及此較小之問題耳。其實此問題亦有一論之價値。</p>
<p>就近日電訊觀察。此次漢志與葉門之戰。含有英意二帝國主義之背景。神經過敏者。遂疑英意或將因此而搆成衝突。然其内幕。並不如是簡單。欲求確切了解此一戰之意義。尙須一考大戰以來阿剌伯半島上種種事變之經過。否則一切論斷。皆難適當。</p>
<p>漢志葉門。皆爲阿剌伯半島上之回敎國家。地位亦皆在紅海之旁。於大戰以前。整個阿剌伯半島。屬於土耳其。故漢志葉門。皆爲。土之屬國。於歐戰爆發之初。阿剌伯之回敎徒。曾應土耳其之招。站立於德奥方面。英國紅海交通。一時頗受威脅。此時英國對德戰爭。物力人力。多資印度接濟。紅海交通。勢不能不有確保。故力謀阿剌伯半島之控制。其對美索波太米亞。巴力斯坦。克拉克之出兵。紅海沿岸之警備。嗾使麥加酋長黑辛氏之反土。及許阿剌伯人獨立之諾言。皆爲其籠絡政策之具體表現。唯至大戰而後。土耳其固已全部放棄阿剌伯半島之宗主權。唯阿剌伯人之獨立。則仍未能完全實現。其中如叙利亞。巴力斯坦。聯約但。（歷史上爲猶太人之地域。唯其現有之人口。多爲阿剌伯人。）美索波太米亞。皆爲英法假國聯委任統治之名。相與瓜分。而其未瓜分之漢志。亦於黑辛統治之下。成爲英之勢力區。比較獨立而不受列强支配者。僅爲伊平薩和德統治下之内惹德。以及介乎漢志葉門間之阿西爾。與波斯灣内之庫威特。除此而外。阿剌伯之土地。大部皆在英人控制之下。然英人之心。猶未饜足。常欲挾漢志國王黑辛爲傀儡。以達其控制整個半島之目的。至一九二四年。遂乘土耳其廢黜回敎敎王之時機。擁黑辛爲回敎敎王。藉以收攬阿剌伯各部落之人心。不料英人此一舉動。不獨不足以安撫阿剌伯半島上之各部落。反而激起伊平薩和德之憤怒。釀成推倒黑辛之大運動。結果遂使伊平薩和德擊敗黑辛。割取漢志。至一九三○年。伊平薩和德又征服屏蔽葉門之阿西爾。故今日報章所傳之漢志國王。實卽當日之内惹德國王。至一九三二年。以所轄領土較前大增。故已更名爲薩和德阿剌伯王國。今乃單稱爲漢志國王矣。</p>
<p>吾人苟不忽略此等事實之經過。則今次阿剌伯半島上之戰爭。卽不難索解。要而言之。卽爲阿剌伯民族獨立統一運動之表現是已。蓋大戰而後。阿剌種束縛而爲完全獨立之國家。自爲情理之常。而領導此一獨立統一運動者。卽爲伊平薩和德。溯自伊氏於一九二四丨五年。擊敗親英之黑辛割取漢志而後。削平叛亂。征服阿西爾。威望日著。餘在英法勢力不者外。伊氏勢力所不能達者。僅一紅海邊之葉門與波斯灣内之庫威特。故去統一之局。相差已不遠。近頃伊氏雖與英人和好無嫌。然謂彼亦英人之傀儡。實爲過言。據國民社倫敦電云。英駐漢志公使。曾探詢漢志當局進兵之目的地。且表示漢志兵隊若侵入亞丁區域。英將出而干涉。觀此可知英人未必卽以伊氏爲擴展英國勢力之工具也。</p>
<p>唯意人在葉門之野心。實蓄之已久。葉門地理上與紅海彼岸之意大利殖民地伊利脱利亞。遙遙相對。極便意人之經營。加以英人對於葉門。無意控制。尤使意人之努力。倍形積極。近年以來。如葉門軍隊之訓練。經濟財政之援助。皆着着進行。其意蓋欲於阿剌伯半島上。分嘗杯羹也。自伊平薩和德併呑阿西德之後。葉門寢饋不安。依意之心尤著。今次之戰自内的方面言。不外葉門國王求達其割據自全之道。與伊平薩和德之統一運動。互相衝突所形成。自外的關係方面言。則爲意大利謀據葉門。以爲經營阿剌伯半島之凖備。今兩國之戰。已届决勝之期。阿剌伯之統一運動。果能完成與否。亦可於此卜之。吾人所可預言者。卽此種統一運動。不僅爲意大利所不喜。卽於英國。亦未必卽能首肯也。故意之暗助葉門。尙在情理之中。至英助漢志。似屬言之過早。而英意衝突之説。尤爲神經過敏之言。蓋紅海四週。英法意各擁殖民地。不自今日始。且歷來相安無事。如謂意人經營葉門之後。卽可搆成英意衝突。誰信之哉。</p>

<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統發表聲明補充其意見、銀派參議員亦均有新表示、銀派自身又顯露公開之裂痕、而參議員與財部則復急遽起草白銀議案、凡此種種矛盾事實、致使銀案形勢今日達於極端混亂、</p>
<p>羅斯福總統解釋其銀案態度稱國會决定任何白銀政策、必須出以命令式、而不出以准可式、惟實施此項政策之方法、則須歸之行政元首、並認銀案不必即須通過於本届議會云、羅斯福總統復鄭重表示、彼仍研究昨日白宫會議中銀派之建議、此項建議亦無奇特新頴之處云、關於建議中增加銀凖備一點、羅斯福總統以爲美國歷史上不乏先例、且有若干時期、銀凖備之數量大於現所擬議者、銀凖備降至百分之十二、不過爲近來之情形云、</p>
<p>銀派自身之分裂、則由於參議員波拉阻碍參院銀派會議、波拉對記者談話、怒形於色稱、擬議中之銀案純屬准可性質、此非吾所欲也、吾寗願稍待、俾於此後六月中訴之於全國人民之前、吾人應否定一命令式之銀案、届時當可分曉矣、</p>
<p>波拉今日離開參院會議後、參議員金氏表示、銀派對於具體銀案意見仍未一致云、此言一出、各方異之、蓋以參議員湯姆斯草擬之白銀議案已由銀派提交財長毛根鞱、而此案卽彼等所認爲具體案者也、湯姆斯新案係以其前所提出之各案併成一案、而根據銀派所謂已獲總統同意之計劃草成、其内容如下、（一）規定通貨凖備成分、金佔七成五、銀佔二成五、</p>
<p>（二）以每盎斯不超過五角之購價、收白銀爲國有、</p>
<p>（三）以便宜行事之權授於總統、根據二成五銀凖備政策、收購現銀、</p>
<p>湯姆斯案外、其他銀派參議員尙有提案甚多、例如波拉·畢德門及金氏各對財長毛根韜提出白銀草案、波拉之提案、主張白銀國有及現銀之收買、對總統以命令式出之、金氏及畢德門之草案、聞與湯姆斯案相同、並聞財長毛根韜及財長總參議翁立賁亦曾向銀派提出草案云、</p>
<p>財長毛根韜及翁立賁今晨曾與參議員畢德門恊商、午後復與銀派全體會議、明日仍將繼續舉行、</p>
<p>銀派參議員均各忙於起草、無暇接見新聞記者、惟金氏仍抽閒向人表示、本届議會可望通過銀案云、（八日國民電）</p>
<h3 id="c75">美財部之提案已爲銀派所拒絕 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美聯社訪員今日得息、銀派參議員聆聽財長毛根韜提出之十五條銀案後、即將其全部拒絕、毛根韜草案如下、　　（一）總統得自由處理國内存銀、以明政府鼓鑄銀幣之政策、而不作收白銀爲國有之規定、</p>
<p>（二）僅以現存硬貨而不另發銀劵收購存銀　　赌部官員宣讀提案至此、銀派要人波拉卽離席宣稱、不能贊成者此無力之銀案云、於是該案卽未繼續宣讀、財長毛根韜稱、羅斯福總統尙未披閲該草案、銀派議員因認若輩星期二日白宫會議時所提出之計畫終將爲政府所採擇云、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3 id="c76">羅斯福之考慮　不即發表最後裁决 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>（華盛頓）今日探悉羅總統對於白銀收爲國有之提議、現予以善意的考慮、但在草案來擬成時、不願對於白銀立法案發表最後裁判、關於以白銀爲通貨凖備金百分之二十五一節、羅總統度可接受許可式與指導式立法案、換言之、如國會宣佈贊成此種凖備金之辨法、則此種宣佈羅總統將視爲政策上命令式宣佈、羅總統以爲此政策何時實行、應由總統决定之、聞羅總統昨與白銀派參議員會商時聲明政府僅可收買銀條、而不得照黃金辨法没收銀幣云、參議員畢特門今日聲稱、關於白銀立法案之起草、現已有極好進步、本週内可提交羅總統云、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統宣稱、渠對於白銀收歸國有一舉、是否適宜、現正加以研究、但在此項法案由國會送交總統審核以前、不作任何决定、又白銀收歸國有一旦實行、則政府所收回者、將限於銀條、至於銀幣、則仍聽其流行市面云、按上項法案、規定白銀收歸國有之後、充爲貨幣凖備、其比率爲黃金佔百分之七十五、白銀佔百分之二十五云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3 id="c77">戰債問題羅斯福發宣言　主張收回戰債亦可考慮减輕 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>（華盛頓）戰債問題今日已在政治舞台上佔重要地位、羅總統頃已正式宣言、謂美國主張收回戰債、但對於現感困難而可减輕義務之國、可考慮其請求、至於今年六月可否接受一部份付欵之表示信用者問題、須就各個事件酌量决定之云、目前戰債問題中、有一點爲人嚴重考慮者、乃表示信用暫付一部份債欵之國、究應視爲不履行義務之國、而適用琼森提案所載美國不得供以借欵之條文中、英國最近預算案、固未嘗列入還付美債欵一條也、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日白宫宣稱、關於戰債統制、美國仍願接受歐洲債務國之建議云、總統表示六月十五日到期之戰債究竟如何處置、將視當時之狀况而定、總統繼稱、關於信用付欵與戰債核减、歐洲各國至今尙未向美國有所表示、强生一案亦未影響美國一年來之基本政策、所謂基本政策者、卽債務國自信無力付債時、可向債權國談判也、如現今之局勢、卽其一例云、美國政府在表面上仍望能收回美金一二、○○○、○○○、○○○元以上之戰債、及各種緊急投資、然在實際上政府可有其他意見云、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）紐約商報華盛頓訪電稱、羅總統將在其致國會之咨文中聲明、凡付一部份戰債以表示信用者、美國今後不能接受之、並將聲明附加的立法案、旣非必要、亦不相宜云、紐約通報稱、國會領袖已通知羅總統告以國會解釋瓊森案認債務國雖有信用付欵、亦不能視爲履行義務者、此點羅總統必須承認之云、（十日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）各方現正積極努力挽救軍縮會之破壞、外相西門今日午後正與德總理希特勒所派軍縮專使里賓羅將軍會商、軍縮會主席漢德森在其赴日内瓦之途中、亦曾與法外長巴爾都及駐巴黎英大使會商多次、在巴爾都與漢德森會商之前、法政府曾發表公報稱、法外長所將向漢德森發表之聲明、已獲内閣之贊同云、此殆意謂法國已發最後之言也、（十日路透電）</p>

<p>市上麵粉價値、日趨低賤、麵粉業前途殊形危迫、實業部曾派科長梁上棟來滬、向麵粉商調查衰落情形、俾加拯救、中央社記者昨晨往訪麵粉商鉅子榮宗敬、詢以麵粉價値低賤原因及救濟辦法等、承答甚詳、茲分誌如次、</p>
<h3 id="c154">價値低落原因 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>最近麵粉價値之低落、爲數十年來所未有、其原因盛傳由於剩貨堆積、則非確訊、　各地市上、並未有剩餘麵粉堆積、價値低落眞正原因、一由於銷路之减少、二由於麥價低賤、麵粉銷路、向以東北三省爲主、在三省未被日人侵佔前、每年由滬津各埠運往者數達一千二百餘萬包、今則盡被日商攫奪、據確實調查、日本麵粉運銷東北者月達一百餘萬包、所以大好麵粉市塲、已盡被日商攫去、而麥少低賤可使麵粉成本减低、因其銷路不暢、而麵粉價値、遂益形低賤、</p>

<p>各地麵粉廠、以銷路停滯、相率減工、卽以上海一埠而論、向日可產粉六萬包餘、今則都相繼减工、各廠減數雖不一、平均約減去十分之六、麵粉市面之衰落、於此可見、而内地輸運費項之高昂、苛税雜捐之不能廢除、亦爲整個麵粉事業衰落之一大原因、蓋運費高昂、粉價與麥價相差過鉅、内地人士遂自製麵粉、無形中又减去不少銷數、</p>

<p>榮氏對麵粉業之衰落、認爲須立卽設法救濟、救濟辦法、非空言所能見效、實業部以國庫之空虚、决無財力可以作有力之救濟、故本人認救濟目前之衰落辦法、（一）須减輕内地運費、廢除各種雜捐、（澳麵粉及加拿大麵粉運華、其運費較自滬運至魯省爲低、）（二）减低兩行借欵利率、以體商艱、但非易於辦到云、</p>

<p>昨日我們披露了本報二十餘年的老讀者王蘭生君　封關於詢問如何讀報，整理報紙，及王君令哲就學問題的通訊，今日特簡單致答王君，並望王君給我們的批評。</p>
<p>「如何閲讀報紙」是王君向我們提出的一個問題，王君説，「每日報紙送來，均是毫無計劃的隨意翻閲，於實際上未曾獲得益處一。這確道出了一般人讀報的通病，但「隨意翻閲」郤也不能卽謂「實際上無益處」。因爲「報紙」這東西到底不是「書」，讀報的人總生出讀書時那種嚴肅性的。在普通人的腦裏，讀報的目的自己是不意識到的，他們每天都要看報，等於每天要喝茶，抽烟，同家人，朋友談天一樣，讀報搆成了近代人的生活的一部分，少了它就會苦悶，像失掉了什麽似的，到這時，自己才意識到。世間上像這類的人項多，他們對周圍發生的事件，又關心，又不很關心，只在隨隨便便中受到一些「談助」的材料罷了。你説，這種「隨意翻閲」就無益麽，那也不然，不過獲得的知旘無系統罷了。</p>
<p>至於有目的的去讀報紙的人，自然態度與以上的不同，他每日打開「四五張大報」，先看看標題，很機敏的將全報飛掠一遍，然後去過細看自己要看的部分。有的人特别注意行情貿易，有的人專要研究國際問題，有的人留心社會上許多衝突的現象，有的人喜歡國内政治。於是各人以自己的目的去不斷的研究每一類事件之發生，發展的過程，而成爲某一問題的專門研究者。</p>
<p>讀報不僅要有目的，同時還要注意讀法，讀報不是專門用眼的，還要用你的腦子去辯别新聞的眞僞，用手去做抄，剪，貼的工作。　如以日本四月十七日發表的侵華宣言爲例，如果你覺得這」問題對你很有興趣，你想去研究它，你不僅從四月十七日起天天應該讀這類新聞，你還得把它剪下，貼在一個貼報本上。以這一問題爲中心，去蒐集各方面的材料，如各國對於該項宣言的態度，世界的輿論，以及我國朝野上下對該事態之認識及對策等，集成一問題的研究材料。</p>
<p>然而，做到這一步了，讀報的任務還未開始。因爲以上不過是做到涉獵新聞，蒐集材料而已。讀報最大的任務在分柝事態，解剖事態，對於每一件事作成有系統的認識。關於這一點，就涉到一個人的目的與學力了。這是讀報最重要的一步。</p>
<p>就你個人説，我們不知道你現在凖備研究什麽問題，假若你凖備研究物價時，你不妨卽日起就收集貴處「衣」，「食」，「住」，「燃料」，「雜項」各方面之物價，到一定的時候，作出貴處生活指數的統計來，這不是最有價値，且富興趣的一件事嗎？這就是「實際上有點貢獻」。至於你以爲「假若報紙不是劉覽的讀物」，「那末則當從此計劃攻讀時代的新書了」，這話，我們也不能同意。因爲報紙是活的歷史，是人類的實踐的生活記錄，比任何書籍都重要。我們非常同意你能多讀「時代的新書」，但同時不能一日不讀報紙。</p>
<p>二十年的陳報應該如何整理呢？我們只能提出以下幾項意見，供你參考，具體的方法，無法代定，因爲我們還不知道你的「目的」及你可能做到怎樣的整理。</p>
<p>第一，如果你有寛裕的時間及找到志同道合的人共同作某一問題研究的話，你不妨將這二十年來的陳報，分爲十十年來的國際，二十年來的中國經濟，二十年來的中國政治，二十年來中國社會的演化等等門類分别整理，不過，這决不是你一人或者十三人可能從事的，卽令照做，因爲單憑一份申報的材料，到底也太有限，作成的結論，一定也不很豐富。但是，如果有人做，卽令不甚成功，其蒐集之材料，仍有相當的價値是無疑問的。</p>
<p>第二，就是你自己不能用它，又覺得「徒供蟲蝕鼠咬，甚爲可惜」，那你何不轉贈有能力整理這些東西的人，有能力運用這些材料的專門家呢？我們想，像你這樣熱心社會事業的人，在不能實行第一種辦法時，這是一項較適當的辦法。</p>
<p>第三，就是你已實行了的「裝釘成册庋藏」，裝釘本最好每月一本，上附每月時事提要，每年作總的提要，每月提要粗緻的裝飾在每册的第一頁上，總的提要，置於第十二册末尾。這樣，倘要查考時，就方便多了。這是收藏家的方法。</p>
<p>關於令哲高中畢業後就學的問題，你的關心，我們非常感動。你實在是一個站在時代前面的「父親」，爲後代人作如此認眞的打算，就是社會也應欽佩你的。不過，依我們的意見，你所列舉的許多科目，在中國社會今日都需要，同時也都用不着。因爲目前中國社會是在大變動中，各種科學都需要，同時因着社會不安，有了專門智識的人也英雄無用武之地，工程師做知事，農林家當秘書，所學非所用，在今日比比皆是。對於令哲的擇業，我們以爲，可按照你們家庭經濟力量及他個人的興趣，無論向何方發展都可以；但最最應該注意的：他無論學什麽科一定要其有相當的社會科學智識，一定要認淸中國大衆的出路，就是自己的出路，離開了大衆的福利，造成站在大衆頭上的人不是時代所許可的。關於這一點，我們雖很慚愧，不能具體的答覆你，但以上這點淺薄之見，諒還可供你的參考罷！以後還望你多多指敎！（同時希望王君參讀四月二十五日本欄登載的「怎樣蒐集及鑑别國際新聞」）。（完）</p>
<p>怎樣自學社會科學一書，原定本月十二日出版，茲因印刷事忙，裝訂不及，是以展期三天，敬希公鑒</p>

<p>中等敎育階段内之中學、師範學校·職業學校三種學校、在本年度均有顯著之革改、</p>
<p>自一九二二年中學制度、改用三三制、前三年爲初級中學、後三年爲高級中學、在高級中學中、得設師範科及職業科、於是各地獨立設置之師範學校與職業學校、多有歸併於高級中學中、惟其成效頗不易見本部爰於一九三三年改定中等學校制度、規定師範學校職業學校應單獨設置、并訂定法及規程公布施行、茲將其要點略述如下、</p>
<p>中學分高初兩級修業年限各爲三年、初中招收小學畢業或具有同等學力者、高中招收初中畢業或具有同等學力者、</p>
<p>師範學校師範學校招收初中畢業生修業年限三年、師範學校得酌設特别師範科及幼稚師範科、特别師範科招收高中畢業生、修業年限一年、幼稚師範科招收初中畢業生修業年限二年或三年、地方小學師資不敷分配時、得設簡易師範學校、招收小學畢業生、四年畢業、或於師範學校及公立初級中學内附設簡易師範科、招收初中畢業生修業年限一年、各種師範學校、槪歸公立、</p>
<p>職業學校分高初兩級、初級職業學校修業年限、一年至三年、招收小學畢業及有同等學力者、高級職業學校修業年限三年、招收初中畢業及有同等學力者、職業學校得視需要、附設職業補習學校或職業補習班、招收從事實際生產事業之職工、修業年限不等、</p>
<p>此項法規頒行以後、敎育部爲减少普通中學增設師範學校及職業學校起見、特規定各省市中等敎育經費支配標凖、通令遵辦、其標凖如下、職業學校經費不得低於百分之三十五、師範學校經費約占百分之二十五、中學經費約占百分之四十、</p>
<p>各省市中等敎育經費支配情形、不合此項標凖者、應自一九三四年起至一九三七年止、逐年分别增减、以期符合、</p>
<p>敎育部爲整齊各中學學生畢業程度及增進敎學效率起見、於一九三二年、訂定中學畢業會考辦法、規定非會考及格者、不得畢業、各省市施行以來、已著成效、</p>
<p>茲將一九三○至一九三一年各中等學校槪况分述如下、</p>
<p>學校種類學校數學生數經費數</p>
<p>初級中學一、三三０二二七、八六七一四、七九一、七一一</p>

<p>以中國之地廣人衆、學齡兒童數、自是甚多、羲務敎育一時難於普及、敎育部爲推行義務敎育、於一九三二年頒行第一期實施義務敎育辦法大網、以一九三二年至一九三五年爲第一期、在此期内全國各縣市均應指定城市及鄉村各設義務敎育實騐區、對於區内學齡兒童、均應受義務敎育各該縣市長及公安局長均有恊助實施義務敎育責任、其辦理不力者並應受懲戒處分、同時爲救濟年長失學兒童起見、又頒布短期義務敎育實施辦法、規定各地舉辦短期小學或短期小學班、以識字爲目的、招收十足歲至十六歲之失學兒童、補受短期義務敎育、修業期限定爲一年、</p>
<p>自兩種辦法公布後、各省市敎育行政機關、均已依照辦理、預計在短時期内義務敎育必有相當之進展、</p>
<p>茲將一九三○—一九三一年初等敎育槪况略述如下：</p>
<p>學校數二五○、八四○</p>
<p>兒童數一○、九四八、九七九</p>
<p>歲出數八九、四一六、九七七</p>

<p>杜先生新目日本考察兒童敎育歸國、日昨應本市市立敬業中學校校長陶君廣川之請、在該校大禮堂報告、其所見所聞、茲特整理其演講　錄之於下</p>
<p>日本的敎育當推小學敎育辦理最善小學校舍方面、常常是幾十萬乃至一二百萬元建築的大厦、一方面固是他們的經費充足、但另一方面也可見他們對於小學敎育的重視、他們對於體育、特别注意、差不多没有一個小學校、没有很大很大的操塲、體操的敎材大部份是器械操、都很充實與我國民七八年間相彷彿、每一個小學生、都能表演很好的技衛、他們的精神、更可佩服、記得我們那一次去神户北野小學、適逢天雨、但許多小學生、竟都是赤足單衣地、在濕的操塲上練習勤勤不倦、他們的體育敎材、差不多是男女相差很微、體育敎員、無論男校女校、亦以男敎員充任、而且是由級任敎師擔任的、這是因爲他們深信、凡屬國民都須具有强健的體格、要使國民身體普遍的好、不能單託學校之體操敎員、而在敎員本身、亦應該有好的精神、這是他們對於體操、應由級任担任的卓見、</p>
<p>次之、關於日本的小學敎員、差不多全是假範科</p>
<p>畢業生担任的、同時師範畢業也祗能做小學敎員畢業後、由政府委派充任、其薪金、每月女的約自四十五元起至八十元左右、男的、自五十元至一百五十元爲最高額、係根據各敎員之辦學成績、由視學與校長考成加俸、他們對於校長一職、非常重視、非有極豐富的經騐和德望的人、簡直不能擔任、我們在神户參觀、據一位年紀四十三歲的校長自述、神户六十幾個小學校長、要算他最年靑了、有的甚至已經六七十歲的老者、了由此足見他們是如何的注意小學敎育了、日本小學校的訓育方面、是以天皇爲中心的、没有一個小學生不敬天皇也、没有一個小學生不崇拜對於國家有功動的人物、其社會上之神社、很多都是陳歷這類人物之偶像、或將在生前之功蹟、以實物文字圖畫表示之、使人見而起敬、總之每一個小學生、都已有了忠君愛國之觀念、與爲國犧牲的精神、</p>
<p>日本小學生的紀律、非常的好、上課時候、數千學生的學校、除課室外、絕對見不到一個學生、制服他們喜觀着、尤其喜穿舊制服的觀念、因爲這是表示他們的年級高、認爲榮耀、同時社會上一般人、對這些穿舊或破制服的小學生也、非常敬愛、這一點觀念、卽中學大學生亦是一樣的、日本小學生的課程方面、除了和我們一樣有公民外、更有修身一課、以爲訓練個人修身之用、他們訓練、除了有敎員講解外、更有作法實習室、專門實習各種應對進退的規矩、所以他們在小學生時候、在形式、已訓練成了、非常有禮貎的設備方面、方才也講過、因爲經費充裕、自然完善各種課程、都没有特别敎室、如圖畫敎室手工敎室音樂敎室歷史敎室地理敎室理化敎室、其方法與精神、均重實際、例如他們小學的手工、敎室中間就分有金工塲木工塲車工塲翻砂工塲等、此外他們還有一種鄉土室的設置、中間陳列着各該鄉土的物產、事業風俗人情等等實物或圖表等類、</p>
<p>同人等此次到日本去、表面上他們雖表示着很歡迎、但仍有許多很緊要的地方、我們仍不能見到、就是見到的、也不過是走馬看花、很少有機會站住了看　仔細的、所以我們所見的、也眞祇是個大略而已、</p>
<p>小學方面是如此、中學更不容我們詳細考察、記得有一次到一個化學工業學校、祇見到裏面的設備充實、各種藥品非常豐富、他們的機械工業學校、其規模亦甚宏大、想在必要時可以製造軍用品的、其學生各種作品、頗有作觀、出品銷售到外面去的、</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>因爲這些荷包是並無規定的式樣，規定的顏色，儘可憑各人自己的意思，隨便縫製，於是種種奇巧的式樣，和種種鮮艷的彩色，便漫無限制地給這些人引用起來了。然而這些荷包的功用，却僅僅是裝飾而已，實際上竟從没有人利用它們裝過什麽東西。</p>
<p>至於那根腰帶的本身，乃是用藍色的絲綫所織就的。顏色當然是很奪目。而用以連繫這腰帶的，照例是一個扣子，這些扣子的式樣，也是並無規定的，儘可讓用的人自己想出各種花樣。因此，這個扣子又像荷包一樣地變做了各人誇富眩奇的好資料。想不到的特别扣子，方顯得他自己的財勢。最普通的便是金扣，銀扣，或是銅扣，式樣則隨各人所好而定製，十九是不相同的。然而這此坻銀銅一類的東西，畢竟多是極平凡的質料，祗有較低級的官員，爲財力所限，才不得已而用之；像慶善就絕對不要了！他的一副扣子是用上好的翡翠所鑿就的，我父親也有這樣的一副扣子丨式樣是彫鑿得非常的精巧，也許是慶善自己觀喜這種式樣，也許純粹是玉工的枝巧，那可不知道了。但是我敢確切的擔保，像他那樣的一副扣子，至少可値庫平一千兩。照此刻的銀拆算起來，須合國幣一千五百元以上。慶善的手指上還戴着一只絕大的玉戒，它的價値大槪和那扣子不相上不；所以合併算起來，他這全套服色的價値，至少非五千兩銀子不辦，約合現在的中國國幣七千元。至於他像這樣的服色，究竟有幾套備着，可就不是旁人所能知道的了！一個當内務府大臣的人的服色又如此富麗，誰也不能説他不配；雖然在事實上處處還得仰李蓮英的鼻息，時常弄些東西去孝敬他。（三一）</p>
<h3 id="c241">和鬼妥恊 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 恂子</p>
<p>一天，在法院休息室裏，遇着袁仲濂師；袁師篤信佛法，持戒極嚴；他告訴我説：他會放燄口，燄口屬於佛敎的密宗，能彀超度餓鬼，袁先生又連帶告訴我一件事，證明鬼是有的·</p>
<p>袁先生説：一二八戰後，大塲地方，有位女太太，被鬼附了身；那鬼原來是位八十八師的連長，説的一口杭州官話，因爲在陰間，身上旣冷，肚中又餓；所以向這女太太的家屬，指定要討金剛經，那家人家，四處打聽，打聽得附近一位老尼姑，積存着有念過的八千卷金剛經，便都買來燒，；那鬼連長喜出望覞，説不但他自己、連他手下整連的兵土，都得超生了！</p>
<p>袁先生以信佛的立塲，宣揚敎義，自當别論；不過，我聽了却另有感想；中國人眞不愧是愛和平的民族，連和鬼神都講妥恊，鬼神作祟，無非是要得些好處，便擺開酒飯，點起香燭，請鬼神吃喝一頓，臨了，更燒化上一大堆銀錠，務使那鬼神滿意而去；唉！佛敎的精義，原來是和鬼神妥恊的呀！</p>
<p>基督敎便不然，他們對待魔鬼，毫不客氣，是要加以驅逐的；要是魔鬼不容易打發，便和他搏戰，戰勝而後已；所以基督敎的贊美詩裏，有類似凱旋歌的戰勝曲；原來基督敎是世間法，和佛敎的出世法，根本不同的囉！</p>
<p>惟其中國人是信仰佛敎的民族，所以專講妥恊；這和用酒飯香燭紙錠送鬼，一樣是「他要甚麽就給甚麽」的妥恊主義的表現！</p>
<p>奉勸中國人，往後千萬别再和鬼神妥恊；還是學學基督敎，和魔鬼搏戰吧！</p>

<p>— 錢醉竹</p>
<p>蘇州的風景綫，蘇州人不會利用，反被日本人利用了去。無孔不入的營業法，無怪歐美人，也要退避三舍。　　前天，偶然陪了幾個友人，到天平山去遊玩，剛進童梓門，就見有兩三個「凖老槍」，一哄而上，來作「導遊人。」有我這「嚮導」在旁邉，當然予以拒絕。但他却還不死心，又跟上來道；「先生們遊山玩水，可要帶一些紀念品回去？我這裏有絕好的風景片，帶幾張回府，也不枉出來遊玩一次」</p>
<p>朋友被他打動了心，便站住了看他手裏的照片。</p>
<p>一疊約有百來張，他特别揀出天平山的一組，十張：</p>
<p>「先生，這是天平的名勝，一共十張，只要五角大洋。」</p>
<p>「有虎丘的嗎？」朋友問</p>
<p>「有，有，」他又揀出十二張一組的「也只要五角。」</p>
<p>結果，一元錢買了三組，朋友喜歡得了不得。</p>
<p>遊玩歸來，經過一家日本舖子「東洋堂，」却見幾個「凖老槍，」拿了一大包照片，從裏面走出來。因爲同路的關係，我便和他們搭訕着，探問照片的來歷：　　「這種風景照，每套一百張，日本人每天發給我們，去抖給遊客。賣完一套，給他兩元五角錢，賣不完還他。我們窮朋友，没本錢生意，能弄他塊兒八角，誰不願意去幹，不過要有介紹才行」</p>
<p>朋友聽見，氣很了，把手裏照片，一撕兩半，</p>

<p>他坐在床上，整整的苦悶了一下午，到了晚上，實在無可忍耐了，便將這事偸着告訴了江氏。江氏到了現在，處處覺得親家老爺不錯。而况他們對於婚姻態度，乃是取嫁鷄隨鷄，嫁狗隨狗主義。慢説對姑爺是很滿意了，便是不滿意，也不能有一點話給人家説。無論如何，得把那手絹弄了回來。他也是和他姑娘一般，爲了這事，在坑上翻來覆去一宿。到了次日上午，故意閑淹在門口挑望，看到甘家有個女僕出來，便笑道：王媽你過年好哇！你們老爺在家嗎？王媽笑道：老太太給你拜年，我們老爺上街門去了，太太打牌去了。家裏没人，我給太太送東西去呢？説着把一個翡翠烟咀子舉了兩舉，笑道：給他送這個去：江氏道：你們家忌門不忌門？若不忌門，我就到你家看二爺的病去。（註：平俗，一部分舊家庭，自廢曆元旦至元宵，禁婦女入門）王媽笑道：我們太太還上别人家打牌去呢，忌什麽門？説時，笑着去了。江氏在自己門口猶疑了一會子，就慢慢的走向甘家門口來。徘徊了許久，依然是那個送烟咀子的王媽回來了，託着他帶到積之的屋子裏去。積之正睜着眼睛，向窗户上看了出神呢，忽然看到江氏來了，這倒出於意外的一件事，連忙由被裏伸出手來，向他把了拳頭拱了幾下。江氏進門來，先不看他的臉，却看了他的墊褥，站着床前問道：咱門聽戲回來，都好好的，怎麽你就不舒服了，積之道：感冒病是很容易招惹的。不敢當。還要老太太來看我。（三八二）</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3 id="c247">關於嚴子陵釣壇 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>前讀本刋春遊專號，陳師誠君的「遊七里瀧，」其間有一段；「釣壇高聳山腰，去水約二百餘尺，其何以垂釣？豈滄桑變易，今昔不同，有如是耶？苟斯壇而堪垂釣焉，杭郡盡澤國矣！」</p>
<p>細繹陳君之意，頗疑釣台太高，當年嚴子陵决不能垂綸二百尺，而釣及鱸魚。這眞如宋朝楊萬里的詩；「釣石三千丈，將何作釣絲？」具有同樣懷疑的意味。就是嚴陵志也説：「嚴子陵釣台，山邊有石，名爲釣壇，東西對峙，高百餘丈，下瞰大江。」</p>
<p>第一，在宋代以前的各種志書上，没有載明釣臺的話，後魏酈道道元水經注上，只説：「嚴陵瀨山下有一石室，漢光武帝時，嚴子陵之所居也。山下有磐石，周圍十數丈，交流潭際，蓋陵所遊也。」也許由此出發，有人才編成澤畔羊裘的故事，以形容子陵之淸高。向來逃名之士，如舜於雷澤，尙父于渭濱，以及莊子在濠上觀魚，都比喩人情的恬逸，所以説子陵釣魚，也是很相稱的。許渾的「嚴陵臺下桐江水，解釣鱸魚幾人？」或者就是歌頌釣魚的始作俑者吧？然而我們應該知道，子陵縱然隱居石室之中，没有軍國大事累心，高興就踱到桐江邊來，但他釣魚之處，就是酈道元所説的，那山下的大磐石！而不是去水高百餘丈的山上的石亭子！</p>
<p>第二，再翻閲　地志，則説：「桐廬縣南，有嚴子陵釣魚處。今山邊有石，上平可坐十人，臨水；名爲嚴陵釣壇也。」所謂釣壇，亦指江邊巨石，非把石亭附會。又讀唐駱賓王應詔文：「余以三伏時，行至七里灘，此地卽新安江口也。有嚴子陵釣磯焉。」這裏，更肯定了嚴子陵耕釣富春山時，只有釣磯，而没有釣臺，所謂磯者，卽江邊巨石是也。</p>
<p>第三點，我們敢肯定那富春山巓的兩座石亭，决不是嚴子陵自己所造，他也無需築了壇，然後垂釣；倘再考察石亭的構成，更不是漢代的建築。我們知道那石亭之間，東邊有額爲「高風千古，」當然指子陵而言；西邊有額爲「留鼎一絲，」也是指謝翺而言。以事實講，子陵與謝翺，决不會自己稱贊自己的。這兩座亭子，現在已一樣敗壞頽具着相等的程度。所以我敢確定他是同時造的。况事實上决没這麽長的釣絲！至於石亭爲什麽不架於水涯山側，一定要高踞山巓，則亦有説：</p>
<p>敬仰偉大的人格，必思配之以崇高的地位，古羅馬的敎堂的建築，巓尖簇着聖潔的十字架，也無非要人從遠遠裏就已瞧到了這尊嚴的型物，發出無限感象。把釣壇而危峙在雲嵐裏，也是這個意思。我們總不成在西湖邊見到陳英士的銅象，就説當初陳先生在雲端裏能够騎馬的吧？</p>
<p>由此，我們得下一個斷語，現在富春山下江濱的叢草之間，可纜漁艇的籍黑大石，乃是嚴子陵當年放綸垂釣之處，山巓石亭，是後人將以紀念嚴子陵的建築物。况且釣壇的壇字，説文訓爲封土祭處，包含着尊敬先祖以及紀念的意義。故有人猜度滄桑一變，乃憂子陵之不能釣，更疑杭郡將成澤國，實爲多事！由釣磯而變爲釣壇，由釣壇而高築釣臺，卽今日之石亭；想來就是使人誤會的唯一原因。</p>
<p>話雖這樣説，我也還希望博學者們會再提出更有力的證據，説明現存的釣臺建於何時，何人所建；則解釋這小小的一般人的疑　，並非無聊的舉動！</p>

<p>— 嘯龍</p>
<p>（四）俎上的羔羊</p>
<p>倘若要我舉出世界上最大的説謊者是那一種人，我一定毫不猶疑地説是醫生。醫生是永遠不會對病人説誠實話的，一個病人到臨死的時候，醫生對他的話會仍舊是：「不要憂慮，你的病會快好的。」這樣一直把病人騙到斷氣。同樣地，那個有着希特勒一般的髭鬚的醫生也對我施行了這樣的会倆。　　當一個看護把一張厚棉被把我的身體蓋住了之後，醫生拿了一根盛滿了麻醉藥水的注射器對我説，「這是你將要感受的最大的痛苦，過了這個，你不會再感到難過的。」一邊説，他一邊把注射的利針揷入我的喉嚨内，給我施行局部麻醉。我知道注射的痛苦是有限的，於是我滿意的忍耐着，一直讓他前後六次地把我的喉嚨兩邊都注射過了。</p>
<p>我的喉嚨漸漸地感覺到有點麻木了，過了一會，幾個看護凖備着一切的器械，醫生便第一次把那些可怕的利器伸進我的喉嚨裏來。</p>
<p>我立刻發覺剛纔他對我説的全是謊話了。</p>
<p>我掙扎着，可是手足都被壓制着，完全像一頭被放在俎上受宰割的关　樣。</p>
<p>我看見鮮血從我的喉嚨裏飛濺出來，濺在看護們和醫生的手上，濺在被頭上，濺在壁上。在燈光下面糢糊地看見那些可怕的利器輪流地在醫生和幾個看護們的手中交換着。麻醉藥的注射的功效在那時我看來是極少的，因爲我依然感到很大的痛苦。我要呌出來，可是我不能够，因爲有許多東西堵住了我的嘴。</p>
<p>雖然醫生手術的迅速是可稱讚的，據説前後不到兩分鐘光最，可是我在當時看來，却無異於過了兩個世紀，一直到醫生把最後的鉗子拿出來説了聲「好了！」的時候，我才像從最大的苦刑裏被赦放了一樣。</p>
<p>在那時候，如果我可以有殺掉一個人的權利，我想我定會毫不猶疑地舉起大刀向醫生的腦袋劈下去的。雖然他還拍着我的肩膊笑着説，「手術經過的情形很順利，因爲你能够支持得很好。」</p>
<p>我的鼻管充滿了血，喉又像給漲塞了似的。呼吸彷彿被閉塞着，雖則醫生一壁呌我張開了口來呼吸，可是我依然覺得是窒息着透不過氣來。我好像覺得我快要氣絕了。我覺得我完全經騐到了縊死前被吊着的感覺，和那些臨死的人給痰湧塞着氣管的痛苦。</p>
<p>據諮一般自殺的人，在臨死的俄頃一定要自悔的。可惜悔恨已遲，結果祇有死去。因此我現在想起，如果有想自殺的人，爲避免無可挽救的追悔，最好先去呌醫生把喉核施施手術，嘗嘗那一種幾乎近於死的經騐，好在這不是眞死，不怕悔之無及，這樣一定可以使他臨崖勒馬，翻然回頭，更堅苦地在人生之路上奮鬥。</p>
<h3 id="c268">認眞 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 林珂穆</p>
<p>埃及文化久已堙没了，而金字塔巍然獨存。矗立在沙漠中間，使人想起當日的豐渵偉烈。——爲什麽金字塔會建造起來的呢？是因爲古代埃及人「認眞」的緣故。</p>
<p>但中國人對於生活的態度不同，「戲塲小天地，天地大戲塲」。大家自以爲生旦登塲，有意無意的在做戲。旣在做戲，當然無所謂認眞的道理，大家假一通，糊糊塗塗罷了，不是名士鄭板橋的橫幅到處掛着麽？文曰：「難得糊塗」。</p>
<p>然糊塗如不是天生而要裴作，也要認眞才行，鄭板橋雖然好像玩世，但骨子裏是非常認眞的，否則他的字畫决不會有那麽高深的造詣。而其藝術之所表現，一點也不糊塗。一到近代喪亂滋多，是非風起，人的精神處處遭打擊，每因受壓迫，便只得頽唐起來，不認眞算了。</p>
<p>算來只有佛敎是主張空寂的了，但大乘緣起正理，正反對取空相而起貪者，於畢竟空中生種種過，并不能作不認眞的解釋，懶惰的護符。只看多少學佛人的辛勞，便知他們的目的并非做戲。五覇七雄丑末耳，誠然但將釋迦；耶穌，及中國之老，莊，申，韓，扮起丑末來，終於有些不稱的。</p>
<p>我們中國人的精神何嘗會不認眞呢？醫生之診病，决不寛恕病菌，使病人容留些疾病在身；黨派之傾軋異己，也毫不容情，只差不到「鞭墓」的地步；爭錐刀之末的小販，分文之淸楚，比西洋會計師還精明。只有國家大事難得糊塗，强敵在前，不許認眞，只得罷休了。　　不認眞有幾種説法，一是向壓迫者説的，被打而無力還手，請不認眞算了吧，這是求饒的呼喊，雖失敗而有生機；一是向自己説的，成了道地的糊塗蟲，永無救治；一是向給自己打倒的人説的，是一種麻醉藥，使人安心當奴才。——此外則許多人在做戲，行使僞鈔，或專演空城計，是認眞不起來的。</p>
<p>認眞的生活也許太多苦痛吧，但只有這才是生路——金字塔不是隨便建築起來的。</p>
<h3 id="c269">秭歸新灘 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 郭孟特</p>
<p>秭歸縣舊名歸州，在宜昌之西，水路不過　百餘里，而且每天都有輪船上上下下。這在外人看來，定會以爲該縣的交通是很便利的。</p>
<p>可是不然。從來上川下宜的輪船是很少在這一縣停靠過的。這是因爲該地正當所謂三峽以内，山高，峽窄，江流陡急，而灘更險惡。</p>
<p>在這冬水枯落之際，就是馬力十足而專行川江的輪船，在經過這縣有名的「新灘」時，也得花散百多塊大洋，招請該灘的士人來「要活要活」地呌，扯，拉。</p>
<p>新灘大槪是因其西上二十里原有一「洩灘」而得名。新灘也和其他的灘一樣，是由高山崩倒下來而自然形成的。在這枯水月分，江面的石頭猙獰突出，使江流至此成爲丈餘高的陡坎。所有西上的輪船至此，務必先將鐵練抛上南岸，使千百人挽着，而這頭就用機器絞上，於是　　「要活，嚇活，嚇，嚇，嚇」</p>
<p>這些拉船的人，你是數不淸的！他們爬上石頭，又跳下來；擠到一團，又散開去；有男人，也有女人；有極老的老頭，也有極小的小孩。雖然天氣很冷，靑年男人仍多只穿一件破藍上褂。由灰白色的沙灘襯托出來，有時恰似一棵一棵的或　排一排的遠樹。</p>
<p>「要要活，嚇。</p>
<p>他們的聲音非常之洪亮，和諧，有節奏，有時一聲延得很長，有時一音又極促極快地重奏！嚇，嚇，嚇。</p>
<p>可惜這偉大而優美的聲音總是被它的環境所阻碍着，不能遠遠的傳達到全世界。從山谷裏應回來，就好像是很遠很遠的地方確有其人在那裏倣效的一樣！可是非常之微弱。</p>
<p>新灘的兩岸，共約兩三百人户。他們大多是依靠這灘過生活的。草蓆棚子從半山中一直延下江邊。可是並没有形成一點小小的街市，都是很自由而散雜地居住。他們除賣茶賣酒外，最多的就是鴉片烟。</p>
<p>這般拉船的人終日都是在這些草舖子　　　　手抱着雙膝地坐在一種長板凳上，　望　　　，聽着灘水的狂吼。</p>
<p>他們除拉輪船而外，也拉裝運土商貨物的木船上灘，或包放這些木船下灘，這名呌　　　　。　　這般人的生活是很少變化的，在這冬天裏，他們就全靠這門生意養命，每日在什麽時候要經過什麽船，他們都是預先就知道的，船到時，無論男女老幼都去參加：</p>
<p>「要活，嚇——活</p>
<p>據説只要去參加過的人，不論他拉與未拉，也都是要分幾文大銅板的。</p>
<p>在新灘之東，有一座據説背後曾用鐵練鎖住的因而名之曰「鎖住山」的山。兩岸的石峯崩倒江心。如果有一日照這新灘上面的舊山一樣地崩倒下來，那對於他們這般人是極有利益的。所以他們時常在説：</p>
<p>「要得秭歸興，除非「鎖住」崩。」</p>
<p>他們是常常的在期望着秭歸再有一個更新的新灘　出現。</p>
<h3 id="c270">臙脂水 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 白韋</p>
<p>巴黎一家旅館的飯廳裏，二十多個中國男女圍坐着一張腰圓形桌，正享用着精美的晚餐；這是一個訂婚的筵席。</p>
<p>志穆因爲年紀靑，並且和男主人交誼很深，便被排坐在最末的位上，他那晚身體不大舒服，原是不想赴宴的。倒底經不起男主人幾次電話的催促，終於列席了。</p>
<p>段小姐恰坐在他的右邊，這是一個稍嫌肥胖的十九歲的女郎，説得一口悦耳的北京話。在許多交際塲合中，她把自己的態度訓練得恰好不放浪也不羞澀。少女的特有的美，被她的修飾表現得非常充分。她來到法國，不過四個月，早就成爲一些男性追逐的中心。席上便有兩個：他們傾慕段小姐，却又怯於和她接近；現在正從腰圓形桌的另一端，飛射着妬忌的目光過來，對於志穆和段小姐坐位的逼近，表示無名的憤恨。</p>
<p>男女主人和賓客們都興奮地説着，笑着，二十多個男女不自覺地分成幾個小組，各自有一個議論的焦點。段小姐向來是健談的，附近的喩小姐，洪太太和路先生，也還能凑趣，只有志穆一直不大開口，他悶悶地喝着吃着，不覺得有數衍的必要。這使鄰座的賓客們感覺到異樣地興和殺風景。</p>
<p>志穆的沉默，特别地激起了段小姐的反感。她想：從來也不曾遇見過這樣　個笨拙而冷淡的，却又不算很醜的靑年男子！他不但不知道對鄰座表示最低限度的禮貎上的殷懃，連對身旁的女客，也是半個笑臉都没有的。恐怕是新到法國的罷。但是從他的整飾的晚禮服，和純熟的使用刀叉的姿勢看來，又像是在法國住過很久的。總而言之，同這樣一個靑年男子坐在一起，簡直是不幸！「讓我敎訓敎訓他罷。」段小姐揚眉微笑了。</p>
<p>於是她傳遞了一個喑示的眼波給喩小姐洪太太和路先生，再把兩片紅唇悄悄地向志穆這邊一　，他們都會意地點頭默認了。志穆竟完全没有看到。他只偶然地注意到段小姐拿起放在腿上的手提包，取出小鏡，很自然地在搽抹些紅在她的兩片薄薄的唇上。</p>
<p>席半，賓客們開始向新訂婚的男女主人敬酒，又一致要求男女主人飲一個交杯。一陣歡笑過去，便是賓客間的互敬。</p>
<p>「蘇先生，我們也對喝一點酒，好嗎？」段小姐笑迷迷地向志穆説。</p>
<p>「那很榮幸的。」志穆冷靜地答了。</p>
<p>「蘇行狂，這襄一滿杯紅酒，我還不曾沾唇呢，就請你喝了罷。恕我只能喝小半杯白酒陪你。」</p>
<p>「謝謝你。」志穆舉起段小姐輕輕推過來的杯子，把裏面的液體，完全傾在口裏，便不假思索地一口氣呑下去了。</p>
<p>立刻他發覺那流質全不是紅酒，一點没有那股酸而甜的味！他蹙着額忙分析一下，才斷定那液體不過是一杯礦泉水，再審視杯子的外邊，顯然有從段小姐唇上洗下來的胭脂。志穆暗自詛咒段小姐了：「原來她剛才一連搽了幾次胭脂，目的都是預備洗在礦泉水裏，假充紅酒，來哄騙我的。」他的面部發燒起來。他忍俊向不禁的喩小姐，洪太太和路先生苦笑着。他是被這狡獪的女郎捉弄了！</p>
<p>「謝謝你。」段小姐也同時喝了一小半杯白酒。她望着志穆面前的空杯，便抿着嘴低笑。　　志穆恨恨地側過頭去，打量這頑皮的段小姐。她正和她右邊的金太太在談話，只給一個側面，讓志穆欣賞。他的眼睛很快地緣着她的額部，越過鼻和口，看到她的頸項。這起伏得很美的曲綫，使他滿意地低呼了一口長氣。接着他又貪饞地由她的胸部，一直看下去，到她的大腿。</p>
<p>「把你這豐滿的身體讓我樓抱一夜，來抵償這一杯胭脂水的精緻的淘氣罷！一他回過頭來，正褾危坐着。他不再凝視段小姐，不使别個知道他的心事。</p>
<p>香檳酒被斟在每人面前的漏斗式的杯子裏以後，大家舉起杯來，謝了男女主人，又互祝了健康快樂，有的便一口氣喝了下去，有的却只嘗一嘗，就把杯子放下。筵席算是完結了男女主人。和賓客們不約而同地站起來，離開席面，散坐在幾張茶几的四周，再喝一小杯烈强的甜酒，或白蘭地酒之類。同時侍役也把咖啡送上來。（未完）</p>

<p>阿發不敢希望會中，可是又十二萬分希望會中。他的太陽穴裏有兩隻老鼠在跳，他滿頭是汗，他的眼花了，他看不淸黑板上是什麽字，前面的人頭也在那兒不斷地起伏着。　　「祇中一個財字」，有什麽人擠出來，失望的説。阿發的心裏一亮。可是立刻又暗了，一兩個字中了有什麽用？比全没中更不痛快！</p>
<p>店内的人擠出來，店外的人擠進去，擠進去的眼睛全是急迫的，擠出來的臉色全是灰敗的。</p>
<p>輪到了阿發。一層一層的，從最末行已擠到第二行。抬起頭來看！什麽！他幾乎衝口呌了出來，他全身的血，肉，骨頭，都跳舞起來，唱起歌來。慢些！别是自己在做夢？黑板上寫的會是這幾個熟識到今天竟有些不認識牠們的字？他把眼睛擦了擦，再擦了擦，直揉出了眼涙。這會是自己恰巧圈的幾個字？這倒底是自己在發熱病，還是眞的？他着急到想哭！他喜歡到想哭！他摸了摸額角，大粒的汗珠在滲出來。啊！黑板上寫的是不是眞的這幾個字？你能擔保牠們在幾分鐘後，不會像廣州的中紙搖身一變，一個大錢都不値？這幾個字眞會就是他圈中的幾個字？牠們站在那兒，全是那麽威風凛凛的，像是什麽老朋友突然做了官似的，有些不敢上前去厮認啦！他要每個人告訴他，還要大聲的告訴他，他並不是做夢或是發熱病！這全都是眞的！他中的就是這幾個字！他的兩角錢眞的變出幾萬塊錢來了！而這幾萬塊錢是他一個人的！</p>
<p>他顯得什麽似的，問：（話句簡直是黏在喉頭了，逼都逼不出聲的）「請問請問你，中的是什麽字？」這樣説了，再用手觸一觸站在他面前的戴眼鏡的中年人。　　「大，發，財，四，萬，多，金！」</p>
<p>「眞的？」</p>
<p>那戴眼鏡的彷彿是受了侮辱似的，把頭轉過去看着另塊黑板。</p>
<p>「是兩角錢的票？」</p>
<p>「是前兩天的？」</p>
<p>「兩角錢買中了，眞的會有四萬多塊錢？」</p>
<p>他還想問·他還想問許多問題。這件事情太離奇，太複雜，太荒唐，比做夢都更不敢使自己相信。不，他要直等到錢揑在手裏，才死心塌地的不問。</p>
<p>他是眞的中了。許多人證明黑板上的字，和他圈的字没有不同。不過　明天早上拿。要等澳門總廠匯來，這是老例。</p>
<p>他從許多妬娭的眼堆裏擠了出來。他的頭昂得很高：「我是富翁了！我是富翁了！」他走一步便唸一句，唸一句便笑下下。</p>

<h3 id="c273">縣長罰充苦工 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 明堂</p>
<p>濟南通訊，東阿縣長安某，因在任濫罰公欵，悉入私囊，被人民控告到省，經軍法處審訊屬實，被魯主席韓復榘判處照所收罰欵，加倍罰薪，並罰充苦工，到東門抬土修城頭馬路，以爲貪汚者戒。這可謂是一椿很有趣的事。魯主席韓復榘在任數年，所行所事，每多出人意外。如前次親審某件情殺案，今又將縣長罰充苦工，到城頭抬土修路，此外類此之事尙有幾件，可惜我不一一記得，總之，都是很特别的。這雖不在法律以内，然而以今日法律之效力不彰，貪墨者流，充斥的情勢下，在法外做下這一些很特别的事，倒也未嘗不可説快人快事，如前述東阿縣長安某，在任濫罰公欵，這在通常情形之下，原是算不得一完事，就是人民控告到省，也不是「事出有因，查無實據」就了事？然而韓復榘却給他來一個「罰充苦工」，這就有意思了。縣長罰做苦工，這就是把縣長的罪惡，澈底暴露給人民看看。我想這縣長當其做苦工時，一定有許多人會　住他在看他；而這縣長，在衆目昭彰之下，也一定要羞愧得無地以自容罷。</p>
<p>然而話又説回來。懲治貪汚，是否單單把一二個縣長去罰充苦工，就能生效，這倒多少有點問題。因爲，我們知道，貪汚是由某種社會所產生的。有某種社會組織，然後產生怎樣的社會狀况。而目前的社會，正是根本是一個貪汚的社會。在這樣一個社會下，要不貪的人，又怎樣可得呢？所以，這不是一部分官吏是否貪汚的問題，而是這個社會，根本產生不出不貪與不汚的官吏。韓復榘的把縣長罰充苦工，雖是殺狗給猴子看的辦法，然而大部分的貪官汚吏，是否因韓主席的「殺殺」而能懲前毖後呢？這是我們首先要提出的問題。</p>
<p>固然，韓復榘的懲罰某縣長，原不過偶一爲之，也並未説貪汚一定可以由此肅淸。所以在某種限度下，對於他這一舉，我們不妨贊同的。然而我們却不要忘記，這不過是偶然的事，充其極不過聊快人心，肅淸貪汚，却未見得就可收效。眞正的肅淸貪汚，只有在我們推翻舊社會改造新社會大衆的實踐途徑中方能實現，也只有大衆眞正的推翻舊社會改造新社會才能澈底打倒貪汚，肅淸貪汚。這是我們今日所應認淸的一點。</p>

<p>— 鄒兆</p>
<p>從前有位晋籍的名士，因戀蘇州的山水，就此把山西原籍廢了，而自稱爲蘇人。何物蘇州，令人移情若此。眞的，蘇州確是有許多可以令人留戀呀！然而我尤其是愛她的水：無論是春水微波，或是秋水蕭然，都有令人可愛；眞和她的姑娘們一樣有意思呀！蘇州的水。</p>
<p>暮春的天氣，全部浸沉於温和的氣息中。悄悄地駕着一葉小舸，從城中到天平山去。雖然這裏有迢迢三十里的路程，但是决不會使人感到絲毫寂寥，途上的景物，盡够你消遣；記着，打槳的還是吳娘呢！我赤着雙跌，伸在水裏浸着，發着潺潺的聲音來；不禁低低的吟起吳梅村的詩：「門前一片橫塘水，橫塘雙槳去如飛」這不是形容蘇州的水，又是什麽呢？我不願姓名長留天地間，我只要能做這裏河中一條小魚就够了。</p>
<p>朝發天平，三小時可達，山可並不高，但是生得怎樣的嫵媚動人呀！我想起戴醇士的「春山似美人，」的名句了，春天的山眞美呀！因爲山靜的緣故，鳥鳴愈顯得幽越入耳；大該鳥也添着了六朝烟水氣吧！不然，何以我在他鄉就不曾聽見過。</p>
<p>我來天平，目的是拜謁范文正公祠堂；可是名重千古的范祠，早淪在榛莽荒穢中了！我撥開許多蔓草，才尋到祠門，但是深深的鎖着，令人不得不折向斜徑，在敗屋三椽中，拜瞻文正公的塑像。灰塵是積得那們厚，泥塑已褪去了一層顏色，處處顯得荒凉可憐。我們一代的偉人呀！你做得好一篤義田記，如今你的子孫又怎樣呢？聽鄉老言；范氏的子孫尙賢，城中多有富者，啻是大家</p>

<p>不肯出錢，坐令名勝古蹟，如此殘圯下去，豈不可惜。</p>
<p>在竹林深處，古樹聳天，四周圍以短牆，裏面便是文正公的墓，三邊是山包圍，正面又對着萬笏朝天的奇峯，好一派雄壯的形勢。據説這是文正公的衣冠塚。這裏有淸冽的泉水，我用手掬來飲些，果然沁冷雋永，大該是久行口渴吧！我想：</p>
<p>墓東有高義莊，建在天平之麓，正殿上供着淸高宗的御書。或許就因了御書的關係，莊子便較祠宇修葺得好些，大槪是這緣故。</p>
<p>再過去便是御書亭，據説淸高宗南巡，曾駐蹕於此。有御製詩兩首，當地人士，便奉爲聖明，特地蓋了一所亭子去供奉牠，但是現在也圯廢了！徒供人們憑吊而已。</p>
<p>時間的催人，使得我不得不賦歸去，我眞不願離開這裏呀！我任願終身留在山中，不再向汚穢的都市。但是畢竟歸去也，我躺在潔凈的船尾上，看那如飛的歸雲，暮色蒼茫中，完成我的遊程</p>
<h3 id="c275">人生怎樣才不會消極 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 奔</p>
<p>生息在這世紀的時代裏，大抵説，誰都有三分煩悶，五分痛苦。煩悶，痛苦的終極，就是使人心灰意冷，態度消極。這是難免的一種時代病，説來誠然火冒。</p>
<p>試看；在這一大批同事裏，誰能脱離這種圈套。</p>
<p>老張整日價愁鎖眉梢，開口就離不子「無　　個　，本來年紀還不過二十多歲，一個靑年鼎盛的漢子，看來却是暮氣沈　　，半點兒没有生氣，聽着人家談起世事來，他便要像村婦般的潑駡，彷彿這世界壓根兒是壞的，絲毫没有讚美留戀的地方。據説他所以如此消極，是因爲曾在政治漩渦裏翻過觸斗，卑汚的同輩，出賣了大衆的利益，於是他就毅然决然的退出了，於是他就對一切都抱着悲觀，態度頓然消極了。</p>
<p>老蕭就一談起女人，他便像要暗泣了，雖然對其他的事，遠不像老張那般的一味失望，然而也總表示出充分的消極來。據説他是曾經上過女人的當，自己也曾玩弄過女人，就此他瞭知了女人的所以爲女人，覺得那實在是可惡的東西，所以對之失望萬分，也就對人生根本消極了。</p>
<p>老温雖然比較的好，但近來也漸漸與他們夥在一道，跟着消極起來了。一提起發薪水，他就嘟着嘴，甚至駡起會計先生的娘來，四月過了二十天了，三月的薪水還没有風聲，將來凖會一文不名，根本奉送，純粹義務，這還成什麽世界？所以老温一談到這等事，就格外嘔起氣來，也自有其來由的。</p>
<p>壓根兒一句，大批的同事，誰不是這樣，會着面總是仇人一樣，在一些面孔上，是很難現着笑容的。卽或有，也總是那麽一閃就消靜下去了。</p>
<p>推而廣之，四萬萬同胞，除了少數的「得志階級」，誰不是這樣，尤其是靑年之羣。</p>
<p>這是一種不好的現象，我們須得設法振作起來。</p>
<p>那麽，要怎樣才不會消極？我們應用何種的力量去排解消極的糾纒？據我想如能照下述的做法，是必能獲得相當的效力。</p>
<p>第一，我要提出的，就是我們應有認識，無論是對人生，無論是對社會，都要看得淸淸楚楚，我們是人，人是有一種特殊的使命的，就是要積極我們的人生觀，肩負起我們的責任，立意爲社會做點有益的事業。須知一陷消極，便根本不能有所作爲，也就根本會斵喪人生的意義，混混然苟活一世吧了。</p>
<p>第二，我覺得要提出的，就是應把個人的得失，看得輕些，小些，如戀愛失敗，這又怎値得那樣牽掛，政治上受過折磨，我們就應抓住改進的路由，總之，我們應看得見世上總有比纞愛値得歌頌之所在，政治决不會永遠是黑漆一團。</p>
<p>第三，我要提出的，就是我們日常的生活應嚴格化，律紀化，換句話説，我們應該在極度緊張的「忙」中度活，努力的讀書，努力的寫作，努力的作事，那就煩悶，痛苦，决不會爬上我們的心來了。事實上有好些人之所以呌「無聊」，純粹是因爲「閒」着無事，所以煩悶的種子，就一襲上心頭了，呌你無法不消極。</p>
<p>胡塗的寫了一塲，自己覺得是經騐之談，常常以此自勉，更願與陷入於消極途中的朋友們共勉之。</p>

<p>天剛亮，一輛黑越越的斯蒂倍克，在淸晨的空氣裏衝過，賣菜的已經肩着擔去趕早市，太太剛從那一家公館裏打完麻將回來。王媽趕着把太太迎了進來，太太就會溜溜不絕　講着她這一夜的麻將經，不論是得意地，或是懊喪地，她都會興奮地大聲講着，直至睡興正濃的四少爺，給那喧雜的聲息從夢裏驚醒，　着要春香替他穿起衣裳，老爺也在烟榻上假咳起嗽來　　　　會想到這　是人家睡覺的時便，悄悄地躺上自己的烟榻，也就抽起烟來。</p>
<p>四少爺穿好衣服走進房來，記起先生昨天曾關照他要他帶半塊錢去交航空捐，他向太太要，可是太太正輸了錢，聽到航空捐這名詞就頭痛：「什麽航空捐不航空捐，全不都是騙人的鬼東西。上期的航空奬劵我就曾化去了百把塊錢，也不曾買到了一個什麽名目，别理他們，你去對先生説，是媽媽説了的，我們不捐。」</p>
<p>孩子碰了壁，又怕先生責駡，念得哭了起來：「先生説了是不能不捐的；大家都捐了，有的還捐了一元，二元的。」</p>
<p>「我説了的，不捐——一個錢也不捐。」</p>
<p>孩子儘是哭，哭得太太厭煩起來，儘是駡，也没用，隨着就從皮夾裏取出了一張二毛大洋的小鈔票；「拿去，你對先生説，我們家裏窮，祇能捐二毛。」</p>
<p>孩子接了錢，還是哭。</p>
<p>大少爺和大少奶昨天晚上跳了半夜舞，三點半鐘纔到家裏來睡覺的，這時正好睡，却給太太回家來一陣雜亂鬧醒了，接着又聽到了四少爺的哭吵。大少爺發起脾氣來，隔着樓房呌着駡。大少奶聽着不耐煩，趕着吩咐荷花把桌上的兩頂從舞塲裏帶回來的艷色紙帽送去給四少爺，呌她趕快哄着把他打發到學校裏去。</p>
<p>荷花進來講了許多好話，四少爺終於忘掉了五毛錢航空捐的事，戴上了紙帽，要求和荷花香了幾個嘴，歡歡喜喜地跳進了汽車裏。</p>
<p>走出門，剛碰到兩個穿着西裝的不相識的男　開着一輛亮得耀眼的　喜送四姨太和王小姐回家來，四姨太在大衣袋裏取出一盒巧格力塞在四少爺的手裏，就和三小姐偸偸地溜進她們自己的房裏。</p>
<p>到了校裏，四少爺還戴上了那頂紙帽子，把另外的一頂送給了他的好朋友，又把巧格力分給同學們。他對他們解釋説，他的哥哥時常帶着嫂嫂到舞塲裏去跳舞的，這種帽子就是那裏送他們的，那裏有時還送去跳舞的人各種有趣的玩具，並且哥哥也曾領他去玩過，他曾看到了許多漂亮的女人。孩子們都羨慕着。</p>
<p>放學後回到家裏，太太又預個着出去义麻將，四少爺牽着袖子也要跟了去。吵　　　　太太没　，在皮夾裏　出一塊錢塞進他手裏，叫他帶着荷花着電影去。</p>
<p>於是孩子不再吵鬧了，荷花悄悄地回進房去修飾着；搭着太太的車子一同進了電影院。</p>

<p>ＸＸ兄：</p>
<p>在昨天黃昏時候，又讀了你的來信。又是一紙索債書兒。怎麽這樣放不過人家呵！我原説過我的愛雙梅，是由於一般的形式丨起初是認識，進而發生友誼，乃至發生愛情。普普通通的，本没有什麽説得。然而你定要詳詳細細的説出來，好像你不知道我們的詳情，你便不甘心似地。</p>
<p>爲什麽你會不甘心呢？我請問你—</p>
<p>好罷，假使你定要知道，那我便來告訴你。</p>
<p>在一年温靜的秋天，我正在Ｓ江濱上徜徉着。那時我的心情是和你一樣的，每一個動作裏都含有一個愛的幻夢。我總期待在這旅途中會見一個女人，而且這女人是我所期待而决定要和我發生一段愛情的。懷着這樣的心情，而往來於旅途中的人，自然是危險的，因爲他寂寞的旅况，最易激動那求愛的心。</p>
<p>長久的期待，終於到來了。有一天，那正是個微霧的淸晨吧，我在一個汽車站裏，等候我的旅伴，往遊Ｗ山，我帶的行李很簡單，祗一條毛毯和一個皮包。</p>
<p>曉風微帶寒意的吹着，我倚在那汽車站門口，作我的遐思。我在汽車上會遇得着一個甚麽旅伴呢？我那期待的人到底是在這次的旅程上，還是在第二次，第三次的旅途中？一種飄漠的悲哀，微微地壓在我的心上。</p>
<p>忽然門外履聲嚮了，一種女人皮鞋的聲音—我忙着抬頭一望。呀，我所期待的人來了—一個身材曼妙，容儀很動人的女郎。</p>
<p>一走進車站，她便問有没有車子。我覺得這給我的恩惠，我於是殷殷的走上前去，對她説道：「女士也是上Ｗ山麽？我們同道去怎麽樣」？</p>
<p>「呵，先生也是Ｗ山麽？那，那好極了」。</p>
<p>因爲車子是一個人不開的，我這建議眞是適如她的心想。</p>
<p>於是我們一同坐車上Ｗ山。一點多鐘的山路，便給我們談了許多話了。我們如此便相識了。</p>
<p>車到ＸＸ洞，便須轎而上。雇這時候可給了我個獻殷動的時機。我於是便替她雇轎，便代她照料着東西。由後兩人便一道的上嶺了。</p>
<p>在汽車裏我知道她是位師範學校的畢業生，並在社會上服務了好幾年。她這次來Ｗ山，是來看看她病了的姊姊。可是從她那温柔的儀容中，却看不出一點小學敎師的風情，而且她的談吐簡直是不像死板的師範生。</p>
<p>不知怎樣；我一見了她我便愛她，而且我一見了她例認定她是我所期待的人，便認定她是上天註定給我的愛侣丨</p>

<p>同樣一種功課，由兩位先生敎起來，一個可以使得全課堂生氣蓬勃，一個也許不免僅以聲音盡了催眠的作用——這是我們在學堂裏所能看得到的。這種敎師的成功和失敗，其主要原因應該歸到他們的會不會説話。不但敎師，任何人的成功和失敗，與他的會不會説話，有着密切的關聯。這也許是一種奇蹟，一個人可以憑着他的三寸不爛之舌，而致公卿，食顯祿，爲萬民的主宰。遠的如戰國策士蘇秦張儀之流以兩辦嘴　　換來高位的且不説，近的我們只須看歐美政治舞台上的著名人物，有幾個是不會以美妙的言辭，去換取他的人民的雍護的？談話在各方面都是證明牠的必要而應加以注意的。</p>
<p>作大字典的Ｗｅｂｓｔｅｒ，是一個最會話話的人。他的一席話可以增加人的勇氣。「生不願封萬户侯，但願一識韓荆州一，這一定也是韓荆州能够談吐風生，給人的印象好呵。又如：「Ｆａｌｌ　ｌｏｖｅｉｎ　ｆｉｒｓｔ　ｓｉｇｈｔ」，見了你的面，聽了你的談吐，馬上就會「一見傾心」的——談話所予人的第一個印象好是常有這樣美妙的結果的。</p>
<p>好的談話，並非「語言的遊戲」，常常是有這種實際效果的。談話，更正確一點的説，應該是一種「考談」，意義嚴</p>

<p>，决不含有遊戲的意味。不必看你的　　，只　在你談話的態度上，　　上，加以考察，就可以毫無困難的知道你是具有何種程度的一個人。你的思想，志願，知識，聰明，記憶都可以在你和人幾分鐘談話所予人的印象而得確知。丨丨這可説是「語言的遊戲」嗎？</p>
<p>談話以簡要爲原則要人們十分鐘，二十分鐘的談話，就解决了國家大事丨談話是這樣簡單而又這樣重要的。頂會談話的人只言簡意咳的説他所要説的，决不多言。多言必敗。那説得天花亂墜的人也許是頂不會説話的人。他們容易在人面前暴露自己的短處，容易「露白，」讓人家知道他底細。「沉默是黃金，會説話是白銀，」這句話是很有見地的。</p>
<p>談話的技術是可以學習訓練的。外交家，政治家不是天生的。律師，法官，不但必須在大學裏住上四五年，還必須在演説，辯論，假審判的機會中去儘可能的訓練自己。「談話學」將來是一種學問，而且應該是一種學問，且已有成爲一種學問的趨向了。旣然有「演説學，」「辯論術，」爲什麽不麽該有「談話學或「談話術」呢？</p>
<p>現在美國社會學界有呌作「社會控制」的一種學問，是想用種種方法控制人類的行爲，比如用贊美，奬賞，恐嚇等手段，使他人行爲受我的影響；而施用這些方法，是多半要借助談話的方式的。所以他們很注意這一點。一個「社會控制」專家，一定是一個大談話家，一個十分明了人類心理而長於辭令的人。科學的社會學之辯證論與談話也大有關係，如牠指示我們要從矛盾中認識現實，從全體去理解個體，從事物的運動與發展中去求事實的眞象等丨丨熟習這些也很可以使我們在談話上得到所預期的成功的。今後的社會學家，心理學家，將必然的要重視這種人類的語言機能，使之發展而造福於個人與社會。也許在不久，一般學校裏要設「談話科，」和現在學校裏設「國文科，」「英文科，」一樣呢？</p>
<p>許多大學問家因不善此道而失敗了。許多學力不足的人，因一張嘴的帮助而成功了。這不値得我們注意嗎？我們還把牠當作「語言的遊戲」而忽視嗎？</p>

<p>答：男女雙方過於接近，常常會自然而然的創造出愛情，所以，凡已訂婚約或有情人者交與異性朋友雙方均最應注意，因爲在這種塲合下，最易產生不幸的悲劇。如果對於家庭所訂婚約不滿，應當先將這種婚約取消，决不宜置之不顧而另外與人發生戀愛，更不宜貿貿然與人發生肉體開係同樣，對方也應極力檢點，務候雙方關係不軼出友誼範圍之外。卽使解除婚約，不能爲家庭承認，也决不能這樣做，與他人發生關係，豈非格外爲家庭所厭惡問題較解約豈非格外麻煩而難以解决。而且，解除代訂婚約，雖爲頑固家庭所反對，但尙爲社會所同情，至像尊友愛人這種情形，則不但無人肯同情，而且要爲人所鄙視了。所以編者在爲尊友解决問題前，不得不歸咎他們做事没有理智，太感情用事了。</p>
<p>但是生米煮成熱飯，歸咎已往又有何益，何况頑固家庭過於固執，完全不顧及子女的顧望，現代婚姻觀念，亦是促成這種悲劇的主因，自然，我們也不能完全責備尊友等了。現在編者認爲他們對於目前的處置，最好還是由她一方面向他方提出解約，婚約並無絕對效力，不遵守也不是什麽大了不得的事，項多不過賠償對方損失罷了；一方她更要乞父母，承認他們的婚姻。父母雖然深爲痛恨女兒這種行爲，但慈愛心總有的如果她措辭委婉自己認錯，我想，他們决計不會難爲尊友和硬令他們分離的。萬一竟十分固執，不肯答應，那她也可向父母説「父母代訂婚約，她原無遵從之必要」，她的錯處不過在事前没有解約因此，她的父母卽使到法院去告尊友，也是和解的成分多，没有什麽大了不得的。編者</p>

<p>— 英國喬治吉星作孫浦譯</p>
<p>八點鐘醒轉來丨丨他從臨近響的鐘聲可以知道時間丨丨丁巴利先生異常怱促地穿了衣服。打開了門，他看見門外放着一個托盤，上邊擺着最小限量的早餐的食物；半磅牛奶，麵包與牛油。九點鐘他走下樓梯去，鄭重地敲了一間前廳的門，裏邊響起不諧調的聲音招他進去。這間屋子是被一個中老的人與一個小姑娘住居着，他們正在一心一意地作着普通書籍裝釘的日工。</p>
<p>早安哪，先生，丁巴利先生説，彎了彎他的頭·早安哪，沙格小姐。好睛爽的天氣！好使人快活的天氣！</p>
<p>好像一個人在嚴霜的淸晨似地，他站立着磨擦他的手。那裝書的老人，冷淡地點頭執意後，立刻便給丁巴利先生一件工作，於是這位紳士便熱心地作起來。他正在學習着裝書的初步，他耐心地工作着，而且露出幾分天生的才能，便一直作完了這一日的工作的時間。</p>
<p>丁巴利先生，一位巴克州的紳士，曾以穩確的投資的收入生活在安適與相當的尊貴之中，現在落到這樣的地步了。他曾在哈羅大學讀書，劍橋大學畢業，直到他簡直彷彿作什麽事都大晚了的時候，他思索着職業的選擇；而且他旣没有這樣苦思的必要，便靠近他的有錢有勢的友人卡爾曼先生的村宅，過起單純的怠惰的生活來了。年月靜靜地過去。他曾有一兩次想到結婚，但是一種深沈的思慮，使得他不敢染指；到後來，他覺悟到他生來便是爲着獨身的，而且滿足於獨身的生活了。假如他能同樣淸楚地看到其他誘惑的不可靠，又是多麽好呢！不幸他聽了卡爾曼先生的話，這位先生的平素的談話竟是關於投機，公司，高利率一類的事。丁巴利先生所以受了誘惑並不是因爲他自身的打算；他有着自己使用不了的金錢；但是他想到他那嫁給一個不得意的鄉村的律師的妹妹，以及他們的六個孩子，他們在成人出世的時候，如小説中時常有的富翁舅父似地，是應當歡喜地給以助力。他盲目地信賴了卡爾曼行狂，結果，在一天早晨他　　自己顫抖於破滅的懸崖上；丨收到確實的報告，他便從懸崖上跌落下去了。</p>

<h3 id="c282">小明星李洛埃的表情　到底有没有催使的秘訣（上） <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 廣道</p>
<p>在「潇湘夜深時」（ＡＢｅｄｔｉｍｅＳｔｏｒｙ）裏，我們凡是看見過那位和希佛蘭合演的那位小明星李洛埃（ＢａｄｙＬｅＲｏｙ）的表演的，都覺得有些奇怪丨他怎麽會做各種各樣的表情的？丨誰敎給他的？丨怎樣敎法的？現在我們略爲講一講，倒是很有意思的。</p>
<p>有許多人説，那一定是用什麽秘密方法的，而是在攝影之外所做不到的。但是據説那裏面，並没有什麽秘密的方法丨完全是用極簡單，我們小時候人人所受過的根本方法，而增加子些革新的思想。加以李洛埃是個聰明不過的孩子，這就事半功倍，輕而易舉了。還有一點，就是李洛埃的撫養人，很喜歡對於李洛埃的能力故意誇張，説他有獨特的天才，而是常覺所不能及的。他們喜歡説，他是個天生的「演員」，他一定懂得劇情的。那尤其是笑話了。試想一個二十個月的孩子就懂得劇本，曉得表演，那不如説他連脚本都看得懂的了。不過他的特具的聰明，他有面部的動作能力，他有極可愛的脾氣，能够而情願和他旁邊的人合作，那却是平尋小兒所及不到的。但是要説他懂得劇情，那眞是過甚其詞了。</p>
<p>李洛埃對於他的個人導演的意思，是有透切的了解的。他的個人導演，是一位密斯小姐（ＭｉｓｓＲａｃｈｅｌＳｍｉｔｈ）。她是派拉蒙管理一切小孩子的，而對於這位李洛埃，尤有特别的情感。無論什麽地方要是有李洛埃的地方，亦就有這位史密斯小姐。李洛埃亦最聽史密斯的話。她的一切命令，暗示，請求，他都能一一領會而聽從的。許多人都自稱是李洛埃的「發見者」，但眞實的發見者，却就是這位史密斯小姐。她第一個在救世軍的孤兒院裏看見了他而加以注意。她第一個哄騙著他做各種可笑的動作。李洛埃是「學樣」的能者。你對他做什麽樣子，他就學什麽樣子，並且極其自然逼眞。他在開末拉前面的「感覺」，是完全聽命於他的導演史密斯小姐的。至於廍劇情和脚本，那可以説是與李洛埃毫無關係的。</p>
<p>李洛埃演第一張片子的時候，他不過六個月，當然能使他表情的機會很少。在那個時候，要折攝他那一種表情，大槪祗可以等候他慢慢地發生出那故事中所需要的表情來。可喜的是他的感應力很快，並不要人等得很久。他是那麽天生的天眞活潑，他的一舉一動，差不多隨時有入鏡頭的價値的。可笑的是很難使他哭，或者亦因爲他有了那活潑嬉笑的天眞，誰都不忍去弄他哭的緣故吧。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c283">評「鶼鶼鰈鰈」 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>ＴｈｅＧｉｒｌａｎｄｔｈｅＢｏｙ</p>
<p>「鶼鶼鰈鰈」是麗琳哈蕙的舊作，在導演的手法上是略嫌陳舊的，它在現在的意義，也不能説是屬於「積極」的那一方面的。</p>
<p>然而，我以爲，在這「鶼鶼鰈鰈」裏有幾處地方，尙値得提出來説一説。</p>
<p>在珍妮登台表演時，受到台下一大羣旅館僕役的揶揄，那種嘈雜的聲浪，使後台的公爵急得没有辦法，掩住耳朶不敢去聽前台的倒彩的描寫，的確把那種公爵揶揄得够了。</p>
<p>但是還有正面的揶揄在着；當珍妮和維克多會見了，台下的許多觀衆的手指斥着公爵的描寫也是很好的。</p>
<p>飾公爵的陸迅貝洛克斯，倒是很適配演這個被揶揄的角色的。</p>
<p>這種對於高貴的人們的揶揄，當然不是從政治的立塲出發的，它只是針砭着毁性的虚榮，高歌着純潔的戀愛的勝利而已。</p>
<p>所謂「虚榮」，究竟値得不値得我們去加以針砭呢？我想更重要的倒是根本上剷除了虚榮之源吧。</p>
<p>至於純潔的戀愛，我們已不止一次的説過，在現在不能不是一種過分美麗的幻想。</p>
<p>這　　　的頌讚，對於公爵的揶揄，也無非是城市小有產者的意識形態的表現。他們是歌頌着春天的温暖，厭恨着嫉忌着站在他們頭上的那一羣。而「鶼鶼鰈鰈」中的跳蕩歌唱，不是也正配着他們的口味的嗎？</p>
<p>有人説：「倘有苦悶的事情的時候，只去找麗琳好了。她的戲裏常常能告訴人一些解脱苦悶的路徑」。這不是已經説明了他們的意念了嗎？而且，這也説明了這種「歌舞劇」的意義。</p>
<p>「在鶼鶼鰈鰈」中，麗琳哈蕙於導演威爾海爾姆胥哀爾指揮之下，盡了她的歌舞的職責，但是她的演技的天才，終究是掩不住的，如在珍妮向維克多挑釁的塲面。</p>
<p>照我看來，麗琳的個性是佻　的，Ｓｏｐｈｉｓｔｉｃａｌｅｄ一個典型的資本社會產生出來的女兒。在這「鶼鶼鰈鰈」中，無論歌舞是怎樣的糟躍着她的個性，到底多少可以看出她的那種個性的。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c284">「暴雨梨花」我評 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 徐海容</p>
<p>這片子演出的力量，的確是非常感動人的，雖然故事是很平凡的，但是這裏的描寫是那麽的眞實和生動。</p>
<p>在編制上我們可以發見馬徐維邦先生的聰明，他對於環境的安排，人物的佈置，以及劇的悲哀的氛圍的搆成，統統有極適當的凖備，這是可喜的。</p>
<p>這張片子的成功，我們絕對不能忽略演員們努力的表演，談瑛在「失足恨」中，早已使我們發現這一個極有希望的電影演員，這裏她飾一個盲目者，她能充分的表演出瞎子的苦痛，她所給我們的印象，實在是很深刻的。高占非，陳燕燕，何非光等演來也都很努力，眞是難得。尤其是陳燕燕演賣花到被誘的一節，是多麽的感動人啊！</p>
<p>不過，我們不得不指出導演忽略的地方，譬如小英回家跌倒路上的時候，他没有佈置暴雨，這是疏忽的，此外如小琴和小英的燙髮畫眉等，也是有些不合事實的。</p>
<h3 id="c285">寫於觀「暴雨梨花」後 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 乃煌</p>
<p>千呼萬喚始出來的「暴雨梨花」，早已在金城開映了。</p>
<p>這張片子陳燕燕是改變作風了，但是她的表演還不差，她那種表情是頗能够動人的。</p>
<p>高占非在這張片子裏，非常的當心，在過去的幾張片子之中，我想高占非要算在這張「暴雨梨花」裏爲最佳了。</p>
<p>談瑛她本來是以表演風騷爲特長的，但是在「暴雨梨花」裏，却亦改變作風了，但是到反而比往前表演得認眞，而有進步了。</p>
<p>何非光他是很賣力的，但是爲了鏡頭少的緣故，就不免有些不引人注目之處。</p>
<p>總之「暴雨梨花」是近年來中國影壇上的佳作了，攝影，光綫，佈景，也都有相當的成績。</p>
<p>導演馬徐維邦先生，在這張片子，也可以算得導演成功了。</p>
<h3 id="c286">麗琳哈蕙的老搭擋亨利加拉和威利佛里煦 <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 深翁</p>
<p>祇要提到銀幕上的男女老搭擋，我們就會想起電影皇后皇帝珍妮蓋諾和却爾福雷，琴妮麥唐納和希佛萊，以及葛萊泰嘉寳和約翰吉爾勃等等來的。</p>
<p>現在，我再來説説麗琳哈蕙。她在美國，因爲戲拍得很少，還没有固定的對手。但是她在歐洲，是有兩個很著名的老搭擋。一個是盛傳哈蕙將與結婚的威利佛里煦，一個是亨利加拉。這兩個名字，也許你們已經聽得很多了吧！最有趣的，並不是哈蕙在這部片子裏和威利佛里煦合作，在那部片子裏和亨利加拉合作，這兩位老搭擋，是在一部片子裏同時並用的；並且是飾扮同一角色，也許各位聽見很奇怪吧。</p>
<p>在事實上，原來是烏發公司拍一部片子，常時拿它製成英法德三種語言的拷貝。在德文拷貝中，是威利佛里煦配演。但在英文或是法文拷貝中，就把威利佛里煦換上一個亨利加拉了。像過去的「龍翔鳳舞」，「天堂之路」和「禁苑春濃」許多片子，因爲在中國開映的是英法文拷貝，所以我們祇曉得男主角是亨利加拉，而不會想到還有一個威利佛里煦。現在南京大戲院開映的一部麗琳哈蕙主演的「鶼鶼鰈鰈」ＴｈｅＧｉｒｌａｎｄｔｈｅＢｏｙ。這部片子的男主角，也是亨利加拉，它的成績怎樣，我現在雖不敢多説。但是無論如何，他們倆合作的片子，我們也看過不少，多少决不會使我們失望的。</p>

<p>天一公司自從「靑春之火」，「吉地」，「似</p>
<p>水流年」，「舞宫春夢」，相繼的公映後，因無論在意識上，技巧上，及一切各方面上均有顯著的進步，故社會人仕對於天一的佔價也就抬高了不少。最近該公司出品宣傳了好多時的」紅粉鐵血」，（卽鐵血紅粉所改名）旬日内將在本埠某大戲院公映。本片的主旨，係赤裸裸地暴露北洋軍閥時代的軍閥專橫壓迫民衆的罪惡，昭示革命勢力的偉大，同時細膩的描寫出夫婦的摰愛，良心與利祿的衝突。意識正確而有力，而全片因埋伏着不少的高潮，故演出亦熱烈緊張異常，實爲國片中之一部不可多得的佳構。由王元龍，湯傑，范雪朋主演，蕭正中，陸劍芬，王慧娟，舒麗娟合演。預料該片公映時，定可轟動一時也。</p>

<p>南丹從馬車裏伸出一個頭來，對着他們道·「我希望這次全部的戰事，不致於建築在這樣羅曼的克的基礎上吧。一費茲洛伊和珠麗很掃興地分開了。等到他們走到南丹的跟前，他就對着費茲洛伊道：「費茲洛伊大佐，我給拿破崙一百天的期限丨丨不再多。如果，到了一百天的期限，你還是活着的丨丨你好像是一種殺不掉的靑年的話丨丨你可以到倫敦來和我説話。」費茲洛伊聽了，面上露着得意的神氣，連忙向南丹道謝道：「我一天一天的數着日子好了。一他説完了，將珠麗扶上了車子。珠麗上了車子，不時地伸出頭來，向費茲笑着，心中説不出的快樂，直等到馬車走遠了。</p>
<p>是在此後時日一天一天緊張的時候，珠麗的芳心中，還是充滿着希望。她在花園散步的時候，她亦其樂無藝地低唱着，暗中屈指數着日子，期望着她的愛人可以早些回到她的懷抱出來。但是在南丹的心裏，可是祗覺得一天一天的担負加重起來。恊約軍到底還能支持多少　，他自己能支持多少天，他的心不得不焦慮了。有一天早晨，漢娜正在替他揷上一朶襟花　她説道：「我愛，你是能敢地支持着，但是我恐怕你已經到了破裂點了。」南丹微笑着，但是很勉强的。他説道：「我旣答應了恊約國，我不能竭盡綿薄，但是要像昨日交易所裏的情形，再來　天，那我恐怕露德蔡要關門了。」漢娜聽了，驚慌得手都發顫了。她呌了一聲：「南丹！她不知不覺地，將她要别住那朶花所用的針掉了。」她包着一包眼涙，無可奈何地説道：「南丹，我眞佩服你。你爲你所認爲公義的而奮鬥。就是你失敗了，亦是爲榮名而失敗的。」南丹苦笑道：「有你這樣一位賢慧勇勇敢的妻子，還有一朶小玫瑰别在衣襟上，我就是喪失了一切的錢財，我還是世界上最富的一個人呀。」</p>
<p>羅惠斯跑了進來。他一言不發地將一小捲的紙交給了南丹。南丹默然地讀着。然後他又高聲地讀了出來。上面寫的是：「勃魯却軍隊開始退却，拿破崙已罄其全力以向威靈登丨詹姆斯。」珠麗聽了哭了。她説：「今天是第一百天，費茲洛伊還没有回來！」南丹心裏覺得很難受，但是他還勉强笑着，安慰她道：一第一百天還没有過去哪。珠麗，你忘記了嗎？我是一個魔術家。我曉得在路上，已經有一個愛情希望的信息，上這裏來了。」他説了吩咐他的夫人道：「漢娜，領她去吧。」他又對着他的秘書道：「羅惠斯，跟我來。」他們到了外面，南丹站住了。他深思沉沉地説道：「車馬，房室，僕役，今天我們所有的丨丨可是明天，我恐怕」等他出門上馬車的時候，他的襟花，因爲没有别住，所以掉了，但是他却一些不知道。（未完）</p>

<p>1. To present the National Economic Council's business plan for 1934, it is necessary to discuss its economic situation, as the scope of the business depends on the amount of funding available. For convenience, the budget and a summary of the plan are listed below.</p>

<p>4. The plans for improving the silk and cotton industries have been assigned to the Cotton Industry Control Committee and the Silk Improvement Committee, respectively. Both committees are organized with representatives from businesses related to the work of each committee, and social leaders who are not related to the work of the committee serve as heads. The organizational regulations of the Cotton Industry Control Committee stipulate its functions as follows:</p>
<p>The Cotton Industry Control Committee has the power to guide, supervise, implement control, and reward and punish the national cotton industry and textile industry.</p>
<p>The functions of the Silk Improvement Committee are as follows:</p>
<p>The Silk Improvement Committee has the power to guide, supervise, and reward and punish the national sericulture, silk cocoon, and other industries.</p>
<p>The Silk Improvement Committee may first implement control in a certain area or scope, and gradually promote it to achieve the goal of national silk control.</p>
<p>5. The Review Committee of the National Economic Council has been established, with the Director-General of the Academia Sinica as the Chairman, and the Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, the Director of the Geological Survey, and the heads of relevant ministries and commissions as members. The purpose of this committee is to provide the National Economic Council with technical opinions from the Academia Sinica, etc. Every plan of the Economic Council should first be submitted to the Review Committee for review, and the Review Committee may also propose to the Economic Council the work that it deems the Economic Council should do.</p>
<p>Another function of the Review Committee is to coordinate and allocate research work on economic construction plans. According to what we know, some of these issues have already been discovered in the business procedures of the Economic Council. The Review Committee has allocated this research work as follows:</p>
<p>Highway planning procedures: (1) The Geological Survey will investigate fuel issues; (2) The Highway Administration will investigate improved highways, the most suitable motor engines, and vehicle styles.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Economic Council has requested the cooperation of the League of Nations' communications and transportation agencies to study the above issues, and Chinese technical personnel will go to Geneva this summer to discuss precise investigation methods.</p>
<p>Water Conservancy: The Water Conservancy Administration is collecting documents, and Jiang Yizhi will take them to Geneva soon. Experts to be sent to China this autumn will be consulted first.</p>
<p>Cotton Industry Control Committee: The Academia Sinica is currently studying the plan to establish a cotton industry research institute.</p>
<p>Land Policy: The Land Committee will be organized with three members. The technical work of this committee, such as land and aerial surveying methods, will also request the technical cooperation of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>General Economic Issues: The current situation and future development of light industry, the effectiveness of tariff policies, and the impact of monetary policy on economic development are currently being investigated and studied by Chinese economists under the orders of the Review Committee at home and abroad, and the League of Nations' cooperation and assistance will also be requested for the progress of this work.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Chapter 11: Conclusion (Recommendations for League of Nations Technical Cooperation Methods) <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>1. The above has provided a general description of the businesses in which the various technical agencies of the League of Nations have participated in cooperation. The text often mentions the reports of various foreign experts, which may lead readers to misunderstand the contributions that the various agencies of the League of Nations can make to China's construction work. The effectiveness of the work of foreign experts in China is actually limited. They not only need to know the facts, but also need to understand the true meaning of the facts and their interrelationships. They rarely go to places in China, and they are not familiar with the language, so they rarely come into contact with the people. Differences in perspective are inevitable. Moreover, foreign experts are treated with courtesy by their Chinese colleagues, so they cannot fully understand the hard work of their colleagues in collecting materials and translating documents. Furthermore, within the scope of each business, due to the differences in local customs and habits, and the differences in each period of social evolution, it is not easy for foreign experts to cope with this complex and special task if they only rely on their experience in their own country. Therefore, in addition to their own country, each expert must have knowledge and experience of other countries. The difficulty of the tasks of Chinese administrative and technical personnel cannot be described by those who have not experienced it.</p>
<p>2. It is common for the Chinese government to temporarily hire foreign experts as consultants or extend their service to various administrative and technical agencies. The number of foreign personnel is already quite large. In the future, with the development of industry, the technical staff will be expanded, or more may need to be hired. We do not want to rashly propose to modify the current method of hiring foreign personnel recommended by the League of Nations' technical cooperation representative. However, whether this method is appropriate is also a question. The foreign experts serving in China are already of different categories. The government departments, national agencies, and provincial governments often hire suitable personnel through the introduction of public and private agencies with which they are familiar. Therefore, all personnel hired through the League of Nations often think that they have an unwritten relationship with the League of Nations, or think that they should enjoy special conditions during their term of office. All of this is enough to increase the League of Nations' responsibility, and this responsibility may not be something that the League of Nations Administrative Council is happy to bear.</p>
<p>3. All experts responsible for dispatch by the League of Nations have their special tasks. The League of Nations is also willing to accept the Chinese government's continued requests for dispatching experts and proposals for expanding the technical cooperation plan in 1934. It is recalled that when the National Economic Council was established in 1931, the Chinese government consulted with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations to maintain permanent contact between the economic and financial groups of the League of Nations and the National Economic Council, and to exchange statistics and other reports. Now that technical cooperation has reached a new stage, it is even more necessary to realize this contact and the organization of contact as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I respectfully propose to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations to expand the budget for the technical liaison officer in China (including the office of the technical representative of the League of Nations Administrative Council) (Note).</p>
<p>The Review Committee of the National Economic Council, which is dedicated to economic research and design and is organized by the Director-General of the Academia Sinica, the Secretary-General of this Council, and the Director of the Geological Survey, as mentioned above, can request reports from the office of the technical representative on time in accordance with the 1931 agreement. Now that the National Economic Council has designated several issues for research in order to have concrete plans, if the League of Nations' financial and economic groups can alternately dispatch one senior official to Nanjing, it will definitely be deeply desired by the National Economic Council.</p>
<p>(Note) This office was named the Office of the Technical Cooperation Representative of the League of Nations stationed at the National Economic Council after consultation with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations in November 1933.</p>
<p>The task of the experts dispatched by the technical agencies of the League of Nations should be limited to discussing a certain type or group of clearly defined issues. However, before the discussion, it is necessary to conduct a precise investigation and research in China. This investigation and research work should be carried out by Chinese administrative, technical, and academic agencies or private experts. If the necessary documents can be taken to Geneva by relevant personnel before the foreign experts depart, so that the foreign experts can carry out some work on the way to the East, the term of office of the foreign experts in China can also be reduced accordingly. The matters submitted for discussion by foreign experts should be limited to those related to the planned business, and the selection of foreign experts is especially important. Only those with international reputation can be competent.</p>
<p>During the progress of this business, the League of Nations' technical representative must have a longer term of office. This representative must have more international experience in addition to his own country, and must be clear about the procedures of the international organization he represents. Because with the development of business, the situation and circumstances change accordingly, and the technical representative is the one who relies on on-site investigation of the traces of changes. Therefore, each technical representative should first maintain the necessary contact with the international technical aspects, and then the success of cooperation can be expected. Chinese colleagues should also take this opportunity to make the most of the strengths of foreign personnel, jointly design, and see the implementation as soon as possible.</p>
<p>4. Chinese technical experts are all diligent and devoted to their duties, and the various businesses are proceeding without interruption in order to achieve success. The success of China's construction can be predicted. They have suffered from disasters and wars in the country, and feel that the international cooperation methods are rarely effective, so they can all be unmoved by political heresies and rumors, and devote themselves to the work of active development. There are also those who work hard to plan in order to use the best methods to revitalize the country under the current environment. Although they have true technical knowledge, their background is half from China and half from abroad, and they have also carefully studied the operation of the economic organizations of the major countries in the world. Therefore, they have extraordinary insights into the application of Western public enterprises, finance, economy, industry, agriculture, and foreign social policies, and regard them as the philosophy of the foundation. This may be something that the world does not expect. In short, there are many people in China who have the necessary expert knowledge, can understand their own technical needs, and are insightful about the improvements or innovations that China should have. Except for a few kinds of special experts, these people and their younger generations are more than capable of coping with emergencies under favorable circumstances. Unfortunately, only a few of them have held administrative responsibilities. Although they know very well the difficulties encountered by the great powers and the ways in which they respond, and sometimes their knowledge is even more thorough, except for a few special cases, they have not had the opportunity to participate in public life, industrial management, or the practice of economic policies abroad.</p>
<p>5. The organization and regulations of the League of Nations' technical agencies are quite flexible, and can be used to supplement cooperation methods. The most important thing is to pay attention to sending Chinese experts to foreign countries for inspection. Currently, the Chinese who come into contact with foreigners overseas are only diplomatic officials and well-known figures in the intellectual world who are proficient in foreign languages. In the future, more important personnel in the economic field and public service should be made to have technical contacts with foreigners, and the methods of contact should be specified. The Secretariat of the League of Nations and the International Labor Office are rich in unique information and special technical experience. For fourteen years, Europe has often had a transition period, and the political, economic, and social system before the European War has gradually evolved to adapt to today's new situation. All the materials and experience are enough for people to use. China's participation in this change and evolution is even more profound than that of other countries. The three revolutions of 1911, 1925, and 1927 are steps in the great change, starting with the separation of the old political system, diplomacy, and economic business, social life, and education system. Today, the development of economy and finance, the changes in society, and the trend of politics are seeking a new method of construction. Some of the facts are detailed in the previous text. Therefore, today, the League of Nations should provide all conveniences to enable China to have close contact with the technically responsible personnel in the agencies of various countries, so as to seek practical ways for economic business and economic and social reforms, and the effectiveness of technical cooperation can be seen. The specific methods of contact between Chinese and foreign staff are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Under the guidance of the staff of the Secretariat of the League of Nations and the International Labor Office, and with their experience, use the files of the two agencies in a systematic and planned manner.</p>
<p>(2) The Secretariat of the International Bank for Settlements, the Secretariats of various economic and design committees, and other similar agencies in Europe and the United States can also provide the same convenience.</p>
<p>(3) The technical committees and sub-committees of the League of Nations and the International Labor Organization should invite experts with the above qualifications and interests to participate in the field during their meetings and specific research.</p>
<p>(4) Technical issues related to China's construction can be entrusted to well-known economic and industrial research institutions abroad for testing and research, and it is still agreed that Chinese experts will participate. The detailed methods depend on the nature of the research and investigation.</p>
<p>(5) The League of Nations Health Organization has provided convenience for senior technical personnel of the Chinese government to gain special experience in similar agencies. If this method can be promoted in other areas, it will be even more beneficial.</p>
<p>(6) The proposal of the Chinese Ministry of Education to the League of Nations Committee on Intellectual Cooperation regarding the method of guiding the studies of Chinese students, if developed properly, will also become an important task.</p>
<p>For this reason, I ask to meet with the various technical agencies of the League of Nations and the International Labor Office to examine the appropriate methods for various issues and various individual experiences, so that the Technical Advisory Committee and the Labor Office can have a basis for proposing concrete construction.</p>
<p>6. The National Economic Council recently decided on the business plan for 1934 and stipulated the business expenses as 15 million yuan. The business expenses this year are three times the amount used in the previous two years. The provincial governments in the construction areas selected by the government will receive considerable encouragement and assistance, and the selected economic facilities are already on track. With the solid foundation established, the agency for national economic development will be based on this. This is the original wish of the government when it established the National Economic Council three years ago. In the past three years, the domestic and international situation has been extremely serious. In order to adapt to the environment and take care of the facts, the Council must make its organization flexible and gradually evolve to an appropriate position to develop administrative capacity. The standing committee members of the National Economic Council are now filled by the most important authorities in the government. They must review, research, design, and be responsible for raising funds. The method of technical cooperation between China and the League of Nations is also determined by the standing committee, and the principle of technical cooperation is not limited to the business subsidized or directly handled by the National Economic Council. The cooperation of other ministries and commissions in handling technical business can also be determined by the standing committee.</p>
<p>7. Technical cooperation should continue to be based on the agreements signed in 1931 and renewed in 1933. The method of its implementation should be within the scope of the organization of the League of Nations' technical agencies, and should be flexible so that it can be determined according to the economic and political changes of the present time and the needs of the situation. The purpose of technical cooperation is to enable Chinese and foreign technical agencies to cooperate and consolidate the foundation and authority of China's economic development agencies.</p>
<p>8. Sir Arthur Salter was recently hired by the National Economic Council to study China's current economic and financial problems. Mr. Salter spent three months in China and has recently compiled an investigation report. The matters discussed in the report are listed in order as follows: China in the world economic recession, the Chinese silver dollar and other currencies, the concentration of silver in Shanghai, the equalization of international payments, the equalization of trade, the decline in prices, currency and monetary policy, the re-entry of foreign capital into China, the government revenue and expenditure budget, national debt, agricultural production, industry, railways, and highways. Mr. Salter's report is rich in data and can be used to form an economic development policy.</p>

<p>(Geneva) According to sources close to the League of Nations, Japan's opposition to technical cooperation between the League of Nations and China is actually to undermine the increasingly solid Republic of China. The consolidation of China will deal a fatal blow to Japan's hope of dominating the Far East. They also said that the Rajchman report is purely technical and has no political odor, but the various provisions for rationalizing the cotton and silk industries, building water conservancy projects, and building highways are enough to restore China's prosperity and contain elements that may cause serious competition. It is not yet known what action the League of Nations Administrative Council will take on the Rajchman report. It is believed that the method will be determined after the Advisory Committee on Chinese Affairs reviews the results on May 14. (Reuters dispatch on the 9th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Judging from the report on the League of Nations' technical cooperation plan with China currently under consideration, it can be seen that although the League of Nations has many concerns about directly resisting Japan, it is making sincere efforts to support the General Assembly's resolution of February 24 last year to give China any international assistance it requests to strengthen its foundation. The report has been designated by the authorities as purely technical and non-political, but it is believed that after the implementation of the plan, it will deal a major blow to Japan's policy of controlling China. The efforts to expand China's recent construction movement are also highly praised here. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Expresses Opposition <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its opposition to the Rajchman plan on technical assistance to China published by the League of Nations, believing that the plan cannot save China. 1. The fundamental prerequisite for solving the problem is to promote China's stability and unification, which must be realized by China itself. Otherwise, the joint assistance of the powers will not succeed. Therefore, the Rajchman plan cannot be implemented. 2. If the Rajchman plan can be established, the economic and financial assistance will inevitably have political implications and be politically used in China's internal affairs. However, judging from the examples of several international loans to China in the past, it is already quite obvious. Therefore, the Rajchman plan has the risk of being used to promote China's internal strife. 3. Japan basically agrees with technical and economic assistance to China in principle. However, Japan has the power to maintain peace and stability in East Asia. Therefore, Japan is absolutely opposed to any assistance plan that despises this most relevant fact. (Dentsu dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A Reuters reporter visited officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today and asked about the opinion of the League of Nations officials in Geneva who suspected that Japan's opposition to technical cooperation between the League of Nations and China was actually to undermine China's consolidation. Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to comment on this "unreasonable interpretation by the League of Nations," but said that Japan's judgment of the overall situation in the Far East is far superior to and more important than that of any country, including the League of Nations. Japan is now pursuing a definite policy aimed at maintaining China's security and order. At the beginning of Rajchman's visit to China, his mission was indeed technical, but later he turned into a practically enthusiastic political agent. (Reuters dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan United News Agency published an article today with the authorization of the authorities, foreshadowing the possibility that the Japanese government will warn China or the League of Nations about the issue of providing financial assistance to China. The article stated that it is now known that the Japanese government intends to adhere to its previously announced policy, that is, if international financial assistance to China does not first reorganize China's international debt, the result will inevitably increase China's burden in vain. The huge amount of money remitted by overseas Chinese every year has recently ended, and the excess of imports over exports last year was more than 600 million yuan. If this continues, China will inevitably go bankrupt in a few years. It is rumored that the League of Nations will continue to provide financial assistance to China in accordance with the Rajchman report's list of so-called technical assistance, including assistance to the National Economic Council in Nanjing. This move will increase the burden on the Chinese people and delay China's unification, security, and prosperity. This move will be counterproductive to the promotion of peace in the Far East. Japan cannot tolerate this, because Japan understands that it is the conservator of peace in the Far East. It is now believed that the Japanese government's warning will clearly state that there is a need to suspend consideration of international financial assistance to China, and will state that if any situation arises in China's financial affairs due to international assistance, the Japanese government will take appropriate plans to respond as necessary.

<h3 id="e7">Daily News Promotes Debt Collection: Hoping China Will Reorganize Debts to Japan <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the Tokyo Nichi-Nichi Shimbun published an editorial entitled "Hoping China Will Reorganize Debts to Japan," the gist of which is that, given China's current situation, these huge old debts are difficult to reorganize, which we acknowledge. However, if the National Government genuinely intends to resolve the matter, it can discover concrete methods such as repaying part of the old debts or converting part of them into new loans. If the National Government continues to ignore the old debts, it will be difficult to hope for future Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. The National Government's initiative to reorganize debts to Japan is worthy of celebration as it can improve Sino-Japanese relations. (10th Dispatch from Dentsu)</p>

<h3 id="e8">On the War on the Arabian Peninsula <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, foreign dispatches reported the outbreak of war between Hejaz and Yemen. Subsequent news was scarce, with no developments reported. However, according to reports in recent days, Yemen has been defeated by Hejaz and its capital is about to be besieged. This indicates that the war between the two sides has not ceased since its beginning and has now reached a decisive stage. The reason for the temporary silence in news is that in the preceding days, the world was focused on the more important Far East issue and had no time to attend to this smaller problem. In fact, this problem is also worth discussing.</p>
<p>Observing recent telegrams, the current war between Hejaz and Yemen contains the background of British and Italian imperialism. Overly sensitive observers suspect that Britain and Italy may conflict because of this. However, the inside story is not so simple. To accurately understand the significance of this war, it is necessary to examine the various events on the Arabian Peninsula since the Great War; otherwise, all judgments will be inadequate.</p>
<p>Hejaz and Yemen are both Islamic countries on the Arabian Peninsula, both located by the Red Sea. Before the Great War, the entire Arabian Peninsula belonged to Turkey, so both Hejaz and Yemen were subordinate to Turkey. At the beginning of the European War, the Muslims of Arabia responded to Turkey's call and stood on the side of Germany and Austria. British Red Sea traffic was temporarily threatened. At this time, Britain's war effort, in terms of both material and manpower, largely depended on support from India. Securing Red Sea traffic was imperative, so Britain vigorously sought control of the Arabian Peninsula. Its dispatch of troops to Mesopotamia, Palestine, and Iraq, its Red Sea coastal guard, its instigation of the Sharif of Mecca, Hussein bin Ali, to revolt against Turkey, and its promise of independence to the Arabs were all concrete manifestations of its co-optation policy. Only after the Great War did Turkey completely relinquish sovereignty over the Arabian Peninsula. However, the independence of the Arabs has still not been fully realized. Among them, Syria, Palestine, the League of Nations Mandate of Transjordan (historically a Jewish area, but now populated mostly by Arabs), and Mesopotamia were all divided by Britain and France under the guise of the League of Nations mandate. Hejaz, which was not partitioned, also became a British sphere of influence under Hussein's rule. The only regions that were relatively independent and not controlled by the great powers were Asir, between Hejaz and Yemen, and Nejd and Hasa under the rule of Ibn Saud, as well as Kuwait in the Persian Gulf. Apart from these, most of the Arabian Peninsula was under British control. However, the British were still not satisfied and constantly sought to use King Hussein of Hejaz as a puppet to achieve their goal of controlling the entire peninsula. In 1924, they took advantage of the opportunity when Turkey deposed the Caliph of Islam to support Hussein as the Caliph, thereby winning over the hearts of various tribes in Arabia. Unexpectedly, this move by the British not only failed to appease the various tribes on the Arabian Peninsula but also aroused the anger of Ibn Saud, leading to a major movement to overthrow Hussein. As a result, Ibn Saud defeated Hussein and seized Hejaz. By 1930, Ibn Saud had also conquered Asir, which shielded Yemen. Therefore, the King of Hejaz reported in today's newspapers is actually the former King of Nejd. In 1932, as the territory under his jurisdiction had greatly increased compared to before, it had been renamed the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Now he is simply called the King of Hejaz.</p>
<p>If we do not overlook the course of these events, then the current war on the Arabian Peninsula is not difficult to understand. In short, it is a manifestation of the Arabian national independence and unification movement. After the Great War, it was only natural for the Arab tribes to seek to break free from shackles and become fully independent countries. Ibn Saud is leading this independence and unification movement. Since Ibn Saud defeated the pro-British Hussein in 1924-1925 and seized Hejaz, he has quelled rebellions, conquered Asir, and his prestige has grown daily. Apart from the areas within the sphere of influence of Britain and France, the only places that Ibn Saud's power has not reached are Yemen on the Red Sea coast and Kuwait in the Persian Gulf. Therefore, the prospect of unification is not far off. Although Ibn Saud has recently reconciled with Britain, it is an exaggeration to say that he is a British puppet. According to a Reuters dispatch from London, the British Minister to Hejaz inquired about the destination of the Hejaz authorities' troops and stated that if the Hejaz troops invaded the Aden region, Britain would intervene. This shows that the British may not necessarily regard Ibn Saud as a tool for expanding British influence.</p>
<p>However, Italy's ambition in Yemen has been harbored for a long time. Geographically, Yemen is directly opposite the Italian colony of Eritrea on the other side of the Red Sea, making it extremely convenient for Italian operations. In addition, the British have no intention of controlling Yemen, which makes the Italian efforts all the more active. In recent years, such as the training of the Yemeni army and economic and financial assistance, all have been proceeding steadily. The intention is to share the spoils on the Arabian Peninsula. Since Ibn Saud annexed Asir, Yemen has been uneasy and its reliance on Italy has become more pronounced. From the internal perspective, the current war is nothing more than a clash between the Yemeni king's quest to achieve his own separatist path and Ibn Saud's unification movement. From the external relations perspective, it is Italy's plot to seize Yemen as a preparation for operating on the Arabian Peninsula. The war between the two countries has now reached a decisive stage. Whether the Arab unification movement can be completed can be predicted here. What we can predict is that this unification movement is not only disliked by Italy, but it is also unlikely that Britain will readily agree. Therefore, Italy's secret assistance to Yemen is within reason. As for Britain's assistance to Hejaz, it seems too early to say, and the talk of British-Italian conflict is even more exaggerated. After all, Britain, France, and Italy each have colonies around the Red Sea, which has not started today and have always been at peace with each other. If it is said that the Italian operation in Yemen can constitute a British-Italian conflict, who would believe it?</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain senior official said that the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities have recently been successful in bandit suppression, and the Japanese invasion of South China has become increasingly apparent. In order to prevent problems from arising, a military conference is being convened. The rumored organization of a Southwest National Defense Council is not confirmed. It has been learned that this proposal was rumored long ago, and committee members had already been put forward. However, because the provinces of Hunan, Yunnan, and Guizhou believed that the organization of this conference would not only undermine the unity of national defense construction but also cause external misunderstandings, they did not agree to join the proposal, and it was shelved. Now Chen and Li themselves know that national unity is necessary to resist foreign aggression, so Chen and Li will not participate in any Southwest organization. The recent rumor of an alliance between the five provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan is also mere speculation, as each province is under the guidance of the central government and should strive to build up defenses against foreign insults, leaving no room for their own alliances.

<p>(Beijing) Shi Yousan had previously sent personnel to Sui, detouring to the Yang Monkey bandit group, instigating the Yang bandits to infiltrate the war zone to jointly contact and plot wrongdoing. Shi's representative is still with the Yang bandits. It is heard that Shi's private wealth is extremely rich, totaling more than 10 million yuan. A few days ago, Shi's concubine eloped, taking away more than 700,000 yuan in cash, which shows a glimpse of his wealth. A certain senior official had written to Shi to persuade him to abandon his evil ways and return to the right path. Shi replied that his private wealth was enough to surpass Li Jichun. His ambition has not died, as can be seen from this. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>

If they are not fully enlisted, it is feared that they will flee to the puppet state, becoming a hidden danger. After consultation between the Chahar and Sui representatives and the Military Sub-Committee, the Military Sub-Committee agreed to reorganize a regiment and has sent personnel to join the representatives of Chahar and Sui to negotiate the enlistment of the Yang bandits.

<h3 id="e14">Baliqiao Incident Handled Through Tianjin Municipal Government Negotiations <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The number of workers constructing the Japanese airfield in Baliqiao, Tianjin, remains at over 100 today, with no increase. The Public Security Bureau will report the daily investigation situation in detail to the provincial and municipal governments. The provincial side has decided that the municipal government will be responsible for negotiations before receiving instructions from the central government. Today, I visited Li Junxiang, the director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, who said that the Japanese are forcibly starting construction in Baliqiao under the false pretense of renting land. He has verbally protested several times, and the Japanese are at a loss for words. Regardless of the facts and contracts, the Japanese have no basis. The original contract states that the lessee must be of Chinese nationality, but now the Okura Group has directly started construction, which violates this clause. Furthermore, the original contract states that the terrain of the rice paddies must not be changed, but now they are backfilling to build an airfield, which also violates the contract. Moreover, the court judgment to cancel the lease and the lack of permission from our government are even more unreasonable and unfounded. This matter has been handed over to the municipal government for negotiation. The Public Security Bureau is currently only responsible for the investigation. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A Japanese-language newspaper in Tianjin stated on the 10th that the lease of the Baliqiao farm in southern Tianjin is due to the dense population in the Japanese Concession. Therefore, the Okura Group, a public interest association, rented the land under its name. Construction will begin this summer and be completed next spring, and it can be used as a residential and commercial area. It is also heard that the land is still separated from the Japanese Concession by Wan Denzhuang, Zhangjiaji, Xihuquan, and the Japanese cemetery. If the Japanese expand the concession, they may rely on force to occupy the above places in the future, which can be connected into one piece. (10th Telegram)</p>

<p>(Beijing) A person from Yuguan talked about the discovery of many counterfeit Manchukuo banknotes in various places in Eastern Luan recently. Japanese troops in Linyu, Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, and other places are using these counterfeit banknotes to forcibly purchase goods from shops, causing harm to many stores. Foreign firms established by Japanese and Korean ruffians in various places in Eastern Luan are everywhere, specializing in selling opium, heroin, and other drugs. Although the counties have negotiated with the Japanese to stop this, it has not been effective so far. The people along the railway line mostly understand the Japanese conspiracy, and the sales of poisons are not smooth. Recently, they have been advising sales in counties near the war zone near the railway. Since the theft occurred in Yuguan, the Japanese intelligence agency, under the pretext of defending the area, has been cutting off pedestrians every night at 8:00 PM, and the Kwantung Army Gendarmerie Corps has patrolled the streets and alleys with the puppet police. The public security police of Yu County still hold wooden sticks and guns, issued without a definite term.

<h3 id="e74">US Silver Bill Situation Increasingly Chaotic; Roosevelt Intends to Delay; Senate Silver Faction Experiences Rifts; Treasury Proposal Also Rejected <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt issued a statement supplementing his views, silver senators also made new statements, the silver faction itself revealed open rifts, and senators and the Treasury Department hastily drafted a silver bill. All these contradictory facts have made the silver bill situation extremely chaotic today.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt explained his attitude towards the silver bill, stating that any silver policy decided by Congress must be in the form of a directive, not a permit, but the method of implementing this policy must be left to the chief executive. He also believed that the silver bill does not necessarily need to be passed in this session of Congress. President Roosevelt also solemnly stated that he is still studying the suggestions made by the silver faction at yesterday's White House meeting, and that these suggestions are not particularly novel. Regarding the suggestion to increase silver reserves, President Roosevelt believed that there were many precedents in American history, and that in some periods, the amount of silver reserves was greater than what is currently proposed. The reduction of silver reserves to 12% is only a recent phenomenon.</p>
<p>The division within the silver faction itself is due to Senator Borah hindering the Senate silver faction meeting. Borah, speaking to reporters, said angrily that the proposed silver bill is purely permissive, which is not what he wants. He would rather wait and appeal to the people of the whole country before mid-June, and they should reject a mandatory silver bill, which will be clear by then.</p>
<p>After Borah left the Senate meeting today, Senator King stated that the silver faction still does not have a unified opinion on the specific silver bill. This statement was met with disagreement from all sides, as the silver bill drafted by Senator Thomas had already been submitted by the silver faction to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, and this bill is what they consider to be the specific bill. Thomas's new bill combines all the bills he had previously proposed into one, and it was drafted based on a plan that the silver faction claimed to have obtained the President's approval. Its contents are as follows: (1) Stipulates the composition of currency reserves, with gold accounting for 75% and silver accounting for 25%.</p>
<p>(2) Acquires silver for the state at a purchase price not exceeding 50 cents per ounce.</p>
<p>(3) Grants the President the power to act at his discretion to purchase silver in accordance with the 25% silver reserve policy.</p>
<p>In addition to Thomas's bill, other silver senators have many other proposals. For example, Borah, Pittman, and King each submitted a silver draft to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. Borah's proposal advocates state ownership of silver and the purchase of silver, and issues it to the President in a mandatory manner. King's and Pittman's drafts are said to be the same as Thomas's bill, and it is also said that Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Treasury General Counsel Oliphant also submitted drafts to the silver faction.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Oliphant consulted with Senator Pittman this morning, and then held a meeting with the entire silver faction in the afternoon. They will continue to meet tomorrow.</p>
<p>Silver senators are all busy drafting and have no time to meet with reporters, but King still took the time to tell people that the silver bill is expected to be passed in this session of Congress. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>

<p>(Washington) An Associated Press reporter learned today that after listening to the fifteen articles of the silver bill proposed by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, the silver senators rejected them all. Morgenthau's draft is as follows: (1) The President is free to dispose of the silver in the country to clarify the government's policy of minting silver coins, without making provisions for the state ownership of silver.</p>
<p>(2) Purchase silver reserves only with existing hard currency and without issuing additional silver certificates. When Treasury officials read the proposal to this point, silver faction leader Borah left the meeting and declared that he could not agree with this weak silver bill. Therefore, the bill was not read any further. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau said that President Roosevelt had not yet reviewed the draft, and the silver senators believed that the plan they had proposed at the White House meeting on Tuesday would eventually be adopted by the government. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Roosevelt's Consideration: No Final Decision Immediately <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) It was learned today that President Roosevelt is giving serious consideration to the proposal to nationalize silver, but is unwilling to make a final judgment on the silver legislation bill until the draft is formed. Regarding the 25% silver currency reserve, President Roosevelt can accept permissive and guiding legislation. In other words, if Congress declares its approval of this type of reserve, President Roosevelt will regard this declaration as a mandatory declaration of policy. President Roosevelt believes that the timing of the implementation of this policy should be decided by the President. It was heard that President Roosevelt stated during his meeting with silver senators yesterday that the government can only purchase silver bars and cannot confiscate silver coins in the same way as gold. Senator Pittman stated today that there has been excellent progress in the drafting of the silver legislation bill, and it can be submitted to President Roosevelt this week. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt declared that he is currently studying whether the nationalization of silver is appropriate, but will not make any decision until the bill is submitted to the President by Congress for review. Furthermore, once the nationalization of silver is implemented, the government will limit the silver it recovers to silver bars, while silver coins will still be allowed to circulate in the market. According to the above-mentioned bill, after silver is nationalized, it will be used as a currency reserve, with gold accounting for 75% and silver accounting for 25%. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The war debt issue has taken an important place on the political stage today. President Roosevelt has officially declared that the United States insists on collecting war debts, but can consider the requests of countries that are currently experiencing difficulties and can reduce their obligations. As for the question of whether to accept a partial payment as a sign of good faith in June this year, it must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Currently, one point of serious consideration in the war debt issue is whether countries that make temporary partial payments to show good faith should be regarded as countries that have not fulfilled their obligations, and whether the clause in the Johnson Act stating that the United States cannot provide loans to them should apply. The recent British budget did not include an item for repaying US debt. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The White House announced today that the United States is still willing to accept the suggestions of European debtor nations regarding war debt control. The President stated that how the war debt due on June 15 will be handled will depend on the situation at that time. The President continued, stating that European countries have not yet made any representations to the United States regarding good faith payments and war debt reductions. The Johnson Act has not affected the basic policy of the United States over the past year. The so-called basic policy is that if debtor nations believe they are unable to pay their debts, they can negotiate with creditor nations. The current situation is one example. The US government, on the surface, still hopes to recover more than US$12 billion in war debts and various emergency investments, but in reality, the government may have other opinions. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Commercial Daily's Washington dispatch stated that President Roosevelt will declare in his message to Congress that the United States cannot accept partial payment of war debts as a sign of good faith in the future, and will declare that additional legislation is neither necessary nor appropriate. The New York Times reported that congressional leaders have notified President Roosevelt that Congress interprets the Johnson Act as recognizing that even good faith payments by debtor nations cannot be regarded as fulfilling their obligations, and that President Roosevelt must acknowledge this point.

<p>Shumilovitch, General Manager of the Leningrad Soviet Arctic Company, predicted that commercial navigation directly from Siberia to the United States through the Northern Sea Route may be realized in the future. Once this route is opened, the resources of the Lena River basin will be developed. The area is rich in products, with lush trees, minerals, and timber.

The difficulties are self-evident, but the entire Japanese people are united and know that they must do their best and work hard to promote the welfare of the people of their homeland. Germany and Japan have the same efficiency, courage, and perseverance, which is no coincidence.

<p>(London) All parties are now actively trying to save the destruction of the Disarmament Conference. Foreign Secretary Simon is meeting with General Ribbentrop, the disarmament special envoy sent by German Chancellor Hitler, this afternoon. Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson also met with French Foreign Minister Barthou and the British Ambassador to Paris several times on his way to Geneva. Before Barthou and Henderson met, the French government issued a statement saying that the statement that the French Foreign Minister will make to Henderson has been approved by the cabinet. This almost means that France has made a final statement. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet reviewed the crisis of the Disarmament Conference today and decided on the final rescue method. According to reliable sources, the British Cabinet approved the proposal to France, Germany, and other countries to propose an air force disarmament convention. This type of convention is also the only compromise point in the Geneva talks. If France refuses to discuss this type of convention, the Disarmament Conference may end there. At the same time, a movement aimed at an air force disarmament convention is currently underway. It is learned that France may refuse to limit the air force convention, as this type of convention is tantamount to acknowledging the equality of the German air force as legitimate. Britain has hinted that it is willing to recognize German air force equality within eight years. If France firmly refuses to discuss Britain's proposal, the Disarmament Conference may be permanently adjourned. The British Cabinet's recent attitude clearly supports ending the conference and implementing the expansion of its national defense. An Associated Press reporter learned today that the new armament advisor of the German Foreign Ministry, von Ribbentrop, has secretly arrived in London and has met with Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden. He also plans to consult with Prime Minister MacDonald on the general disarmament situation and work on the proposed air force convention. The Cabinet meeting today decided that if Disarmament Chairman Henderson, Lord Privy Seal Eden, and French Foreign Minister Barthou have any hope of reaching a compromise on air force disarmament, then Foreign Secretary Simon should follow Eden to Geneva on Thursday after Eden goes to Geneva on Saturday. The British military is very willing for France, Germany, and Italy to participate in the air force disarmament conference. After the British air force fell to fifth place, the British government has clearly expressed concern about the aerial security of its territories. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The Foreign Cabinet held a regular meeting to discuss the disarmament issue. As a result of the meeting, it is learned that the government has issued instructions to the British delegation attending the Geneva meeting. The scope of the instructions is very broad, and the principles indicated therein are as follows: (1) Use every possible effort to negotiate with Paris or Geneva to ensure the establishment of a disarmament convention. Therefore, the fact that Lord Privy Seal Eden, the British representative attending the Disarmament Conference, went to Paris to consult with French Foreign Minister Barthou is generally considered extremely important. (2) After the UK's last attempt to compromise, if there is a possibility that the UK's disarmament plan will be finally agreed upon by various countries, the UK representative will propose to conclude a convention limiting the application of the air force.

<p>(Berlin) It is indicated here that the Little Entente countries will formally recognize Soviet Russia soon. Political researchers say that since France changed its policy towards Soviet Russia, this has become only a matter of time. This is because France has historically manipulated the policies of the Little Entente countries. The opinions of the Little Entente countries on recognizing Soviet Russia vary greatly. Czechoslovakia has always advocated recognition. Before the war, Yugoslavia was extremely pro-Russian because it belonged to the same ethnicity, but it changed its attitude after the Soviet communist revolution. However, it has adopted a neutral attitude today. Romania has always opposed recognizing Soviet Russia. Its policy is largely related to the Bessarabia issue. Romania's policy towards Russia has always been in the hands of its Foreign Minister Titulescu alone. Now his power is weakening day by day, and the change in French policy is also enough to influence Romania's attitude towards formally recognizing Soviet Russia. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>

<p>Bucharest Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck recently visited Foreign Minister Titulescu. Romanian political circles attach great importance to Beck's visit.

The issue of how to revise the Polish-Romanian alliance treaty will likely be raised for discussion. When the two countries concluded the alliance, they were concerned about Soviet Russia on the one hand and fearful of Germany on the other. Now the situation has changed. Poland's relations with Russia and Germany have improved, and the Little Entente countries may also recognize Soviet Russia. Therefore, the Polish-Romanian alliance needs to change direction, and this will be discussed when the Polish Foreign Minister visits here this time. In addition, some special issues will also be raised for discussion, such as the reorganization of the Romanian army. It is generally expected that Romania will consult with Poland on the purchase of Polish aircraft. (Havas, 9th)</p>

Although I do not have the authority to conduct definitive economic and diplomatic negotiations, my mission is to rectify complex situations based on the current friendly relations among the countries along the Pacific coast. For example, it is not appropriate for Japan to import a large quantity of Australian wheat this year and then none at all the following year. Therefore, a certain degree of understanding should exist between the two countries to establish a long-term plan. Although the races of the countries along the Pacific coast are different, they must work together to maintain peace and develop industries to achieve prosperity. The success or failure of this depends on the friendly relations between the countries. I sincerely hope that my visit to Japan will contribute to the relationship between Japan and Australia." (10th Dispatch from Rengo)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota has decided to take the opportunity of Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Blue Mountains' visit to Japan to have a thorough discussion on fundamentally adjusting Japan-Australia trade. The current Japan-Australia trade relationship is as follows: (1) Australia's trade surplus with Japan is consistently large. Last year, Australia's trade surplus with Japan reached 15.3 million yuan and is expected to increase in the future. (2) Australia's exports to Japan account for 10% of its total exports, with wheat accounting for about 21% of its total production. (3) If Australia, as an agricultural country, were to completely cut off its annual wheat exports to Japan, it would inevitably cause a profound agricultural panic. (4) Japan relies on Australia for 97% of its annual wheat imports, so severing trade relations with Australia would also be a fatal blow. As mentioned above, Japan and Australia have a close and inseparable relationship. Therefore, it is necessary for Japan to adjust its trade deficit with Australia to some extent. In this regard, it is not impossible for Japan's modern industrial capacity and Australia's current productive capacity to shake hands in a mutually beneficial way. Regarding this matter, the Foreign Minister plans to urge Foreign Minister Blue Mountains to consider and propose fundamental measures to adjust the one-sided trade. (10th Dispatch from Dentsu)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Next Year is the Key to World Peace and War: The Success or Failure of the Naval Conference and the Survival of the League of Nations <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Diplomats here today issued a prophetic warning, stating that next year will be one of the most critical years for world peace since the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. The most important event will be the 1935 Naval Conference. The Saar plebiscite and the withdrawal of Japan and Germany from the League of Nations will also come to fruition next year. These three issues will plunge the world into panic. According to pessimistic observers, if this year's disarmament conference ends in complete failure, the League of Nations in 1935 may cease to be the League of Nations. However, officials in charge of the League of Nations do not express excessive pessimism. Although they believe that the League of Nations is currently facing many difficulties and that the coming year will be even more difficult to deal with, they believe that if they can overcome these future difficulties, the future League of Nations will be healthier. According to a senior official of the League of Nations, the League of Nations is now in a transitional period from the European era to the era of the entire world, because the League of Nations is committed to the interests of Europe and also to the interests of the entire world. Some League of Nations officials also stated that although some member states have left the League of Nations, major powers such as the Soviet Union and the United States are now trying to get closer to the League of Nations. The United States' cooperation with the League of Nations is currently the closest and most extensive. The Soviet Union's tendency to join the League of Nations is also very obvious. Supporters of the League of Nations are very pleased with this news. They all believe that the League of Nations is currently in trouble and must struggle. Next year will encounter the biggest political panic. Europe will focus on the Saar plebiscite, the Naval Conference, and the difficult issues of Japan and Germany's departure. As for the League of Nations itself, it currently has two propositions: one faction advocates allowing the United States and Russia to join and urging Japan and Germany to return to the League of Nations to enhance the League of Nations' position. These supporters of the League of Nations all advocate that the League of Nations should aim for world peace and not be limited by the European continent. The other faction advocates that the League of Nations should focus on Europe. This faction believes that the League of Nations can fulfill its task by implementing the Treaty of Versailles. However, all members of the League of Nations recognize that the success or failure of the 1935 Naval Conference will directly affect the League of Nations itself. They believe that the Far Eastern issue is closely related to the League of Nations. Although this conference is not led by the League of Nations, the outcome of the conference is the key to resolving the Far Eastern situation. Its impact on the League of Nations and the whole world is self-evident. Many observers say that whether Japan and Germany will return to the League of Nations will depend on the success or failure of the 1935 Naval Conference. No one can answer the above questions at present, but they have been deeply considered by diplomats and politicians. (10th Dispatch from Kokumin)</p>

<p>Saito Cabinet's Transition Period Extended</p>
<p>Military Intervention Limited Secretly</p>
<p>The Saito Cabinet was originally a transitional government during the so-called emergency period. Observations in Japanese political circles believed that it would be difficult for Saito to continue for a long time. Moreover, the military had long had the intention of seizing power and establishing a strong cabinet, so Saito's downfall seemed inevitable. In addition, the political parties had also expressed dissatisfaction with him, especially after the ethics issue occurred and Ichiro Hatoyama resigned. The cabinet's downfall should have been inevitable. However, he did not fall, and there was even a situation of long-term continuation. The reason why he did not fall is that the military itself did not completely advocate the immediate establishment of a military cabinet. In particular, the powerful figures in the upper echelons felt that it was unwise to abandon the constitution, and that challenging foreign countries also contained huge risks. Secondly, the political parties were dissatisfied with the current cabinet, but they had many concerns. They were afraid that once a military cabinet was realized, the political parties would completely lose the opportunity to interfere in political power. At the same time, the political parties had lost the sympathy of the people, and the opportunity to form a cabinet became even less. Therefore, the Saito Cabinet was able to maintain itself.</p>
<p>This time, for the issue of supplementing the Minister of Education, the Seiyukai did not immediately recommend someone to join the cabinet, which was another stalemate. It seemed that the Seiyukai was about to part ways with the Saito Cabinet. Unexpectedly, the military called for a tough diplomatic policy, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an unofficial statement on April 17, so the cabinet was very praised by the military, and of course it also calmed the military's dissatisfaction. The stability of the Saito Cabinet increased somewhat.</p>
<p>There was also an unexpected gain for the Saito Cabinet, which was the Privy Council. Because Kiichiro Hiranuma was the Vice President and the leader of the right-wing faction, he was one of the powerful successors to the position of Prime Minister after Saito's downfall. He also had a tacit understanding with the military, especially the young officers, so he always wanted to instigate a movement to overthrow the cabinet. However, he was very incompatible with the elder statesman Kinmochi Saionji, so he lost the support of the zaibatsu and some of the military. The navy was even more dissatisfied with him. Therefore, the movement to overthrow the cabinet that he instigated could only mobilize the movement of the National League faction. This time, Yuzaburo Kuratomi (President of the Privy Council) resigned from the position of President because he could not defeat Hiranuma's power and it was inconvenient to engage in open struggle, using eye disease as an excuse. This should have been a good opportunity for Hiranuma. He could easily launch a movement to overthrow the cabinet, and he could also use the power of the Privy Council to restrain the various actions of the cabinet. This was Hiranuma's good fortune and the prelude to the transformation of Japanese politics. Who knew that Kinmochi Saionji happened to enter Tokyo at this time? The Saito Cabinet in distress received powerful help. Regarding Kuratomi's resignation, according to the usual practice, after Yamagata resigned, Kiyoura was promoted to President with the qualifications of Vice President. After Kiyoura, Hamao was also promoted to President with the qualifications of Vice President. After Hamao resigned, Hozumi was also promoted to President with the qualifications of Vice President. Kuratomi's appointment as President was also the same as succeeding Hozumi with the qualifications of Vice President. In short, the Privy Council has always had the tradition that the President is always promoted by the Vice President. But this time, it violated the precedent, and Hiranuma Kiichiro was not promoted to Vice President, but instead went to invite the former Minister of the Imperial Household, Kiyotake Ichiki, to serve as President. In Japan, where bureaucracy prevails, how could such a counter-conventional thing be allowed to happen?</p>
<p>The reason is that not only is there a gap in feelings between Hiranuma and Saito, but if the position of President falls on Hiranuma, then even if Saito can barely maintain it, he will eventually resign in a short period of time, or even cause a major political turmoil. This is the maturity of military rule and the death of Japanese constitutional politics. Saionji, who adhered to the theory of constitutional convention, was even more opposed to this. The political parties, of course, were also unwilling to place all the political power in the hands of the military. Therefore, when Saito recommended Ichiki as President, he did not discuss it with Hiranuma, and it was a means to suppress Hiranuma. After Hiranuma found out, he was extremely dissatisfied with Saito and could not actively launch a movement to overthrow the cabinet for a while. He will probably submit his resignation after a considerable period of time and resign from the position of Vice President of the Privy Council to carry out activities from another aspect.

<h3 id="e94">Liaoning Puppet Military Police Uprising Gains Momentum, Triggered by Japanese Army Confiscating Firearms, Rebels Immediately Unite with Volunteer Army <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>(Shenyang Correspondence) In addition to actively constructing military works in the Northeast, Japan aims to eliminate internal elements and wipe out the volunteer army. Recently, it has been observed that the puppet army often evades attacks on the volunteer army, so special precautions have been taken, fearing that they will collude with the volunteer army. The puppet military police also feel uneasy, fearing unforeseen circumstances. Furthermore, persuaded by patriotic people at home who resist the enemy, they have successively rebelled and surrendered to our volunteer army. Among them are Wang Dianzhong, commander of the puppet garrison in Yingkou, with more than 400 troops, and Wang Yongcheng, captain of the puppet police team in Fusong, with more than 300 troops. It was found that Wang Dianzhong's troops, due to the persuasion of a special commissioner from a certain national salvation organization, deeply felt the danger of being discarded after their usefulness was over. They expressed a good impression of the volunteer army. Whenever they attacked the volunteer army in the eastern region, they only put on a show and were unwilling to put in any effort, which was discovered by the Japanese army. In late last month, the Japanese army launched a large-scale attack on Deng Tiemei's troops and detained Wang Dianzhong, escorting him to Shenyang or Changchun, with his life or death unknown. They also disarmed two companies of the army stationed in Tianzhuangtai. Yang Yinzhou, the regimental commander of the army stationed in Yingkou, upon hearing the news, immediately led his headquarters of more than 400 troops to rebel, surrounded and confiscated more than 200 firearms from the Japanese garrison, and killed more than 100 Japanese soldiers. The market was chaotic for a while. The Japanese navy blockaded the seaport, and ships changed to landing in Dalian. Furthermore, Wang Yongcheng was from Tang Juhua's volunteer army and had been serving as the captain of the Fusong County Public Security Brigade under the puppet government for nearly two years. He often supplied the eastern volunteer army with military supplies. Recently, because the Japanese repeatedly limited the confiscation of firearms and disbanded the troops, Wang suddenly led all the police regiment of more than 300 people to rebel, taking the Japanese army stationed in Fusong by surprise, surrounding and disarming them, seizing more than 100 firearms, and then attacked Mengjiang County, Jilin, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese army. He is now in contact with a special commissioner from a certain national salvation organization and is preparing to launch a large-scale attack this summer when the green gauze screens rise with the volunteer armies of Wang Fengge, Deng Tiemei, Ren Fuxiang, and others. According to information from the headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army, regarding the anti-Japanese and punitive puppet situation of the volunteer army in various parts of the Northeast, in January and February of this year, the Japanese army mobilized to deal with the volunteer army in various places a total of 401 times, with 53,876 officers and soldiers participating (excluding the puppet army). Statistics show that there are 282 volunteer army leaders and 97,638 troops. Japanese military intelligence is likely to be accurate, and the volunteer army still has more than 100,000 people fighting in a bloody battle, which proves that the hearts of the people in the Northeast have not died. Recently, Captain Hanabu of the Japanese army stationed in Jilin committed suicide, and Colonel Iizuka was killed in battle. The county chiefs of the three counties of An, Fu, and Meng in Liaoning Province led the police and militias to rebel, all of which were triggered by the confiscation of civilian guns and the forced purchase of civilian land. The rebellion of Wang Dianzhong's puppet garrison in Yingkou was also caused by the Japanese detaining Wang Dianzhong to resolve the puppet army. Therefore, the people in the Liaodong area would rather voluntarily send their guns to the volunteer army than hand them over to the Japanese puppet authorities. Wang Fengge's volunteer army alone has received thousands of guns, greatly increasing its strength. The people in various counties on the Jehol border have jointly refused to hand over their guns, resulting in fierce battles. All these events are showing a tendency to gradually expand. Recently, as the time for the green gauze screens to rise is approaching and the clouds of war between Japan and Russia are gradually thickening, the bloodbath in the Northeast will give the anti-Japanese volunteer army a boost.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Hankou, Expresses Financial Opinions, Scheduled to Inspect Hunan <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou Correspondence) Kong Xiangxi, Deputy President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, went to Jiangxi from Beijing to visit Chiang Kai-shek, intending to come to Hubei immediately. Because of a foot ailment, he stayed in Lushan for a while. He descended the mountain on the 8th, accompanied by his wife, Madam Soong Ai-ling, and Madam Soong Mei-ling, the wife of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. They sailed on the warship "Haixing" from Xunyang and arrived in Hankou at 11:00 AM on the 9th. Military and political dignitaries gave a grand welcome. A reporter interviewed Mr. Kong on the ship and had a long conversation. A record is as follows: Mr. Kong said, "Since I have been in charge of the Ministry of Finance, I have been shocked by the lack of recovery from the people's difficulties and the daily depletion of national resources. I have been thinking of engaging in rectification in order to enrich the country and nourish the people. During the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, I proposed two proposals for rectifying land taxes and reducing surcharges, which were both passed and handed over to the Executive Yuan for verification and handling. As I am in charge of accounting and politics, I will naturally urge their implementation. Because there are too many exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes, the people cannot bear them. Moreover, land taxes exceed the regular contributions by several times, so they must be resolutely abolished. This kind of long-standing accumulation of exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes is due to the failure to determine local budgets, which is the crux of the matter. In the future, to abolish exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes, budgets must first be determined to make income and expenditure suitable. County budgets are approved by the province, and surplus funds are submitted to the provincial treasury. If there is a shortfall, the provincial treasury will subsidize it. Provincial budgets are approved by the central government, and surplus funds are submitted to the central government for approval and storage for construction purposes. If there is a shortfall, it will also be subsidized by the central government. In this way, income and expenditure will have fixed measures, financial resources will not be depleted, and the people will be spared from harassment. Furthermore, in order to implement benefits to the fullest extent, a national financial conference will be convened on the 21st of this month to discuss in detail, focusing on the abolition of exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes, the reduction of surcharges, and the determination of budgets in order to obtain a complete solution. My departure from Beijing this time is to inspect the finances of the five provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Henan, because the above five provinces are bandit suppression areas, the finances urgently need to be rectified, and the people especially hope to recover. When I was in Jiangxi, I visited Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and inspected the finances. The anti-bandit military affairs in that province have indeed made significant progress and can be concluded after the autumn. However, the local area is devastated, and the people have fled, so we must step up recruitment and construction. Moreover, those who follow the bandits include those who are coerced and those who follow blindly, so we must add persuasion. Then, the clearing of the countryside and the post-war settlement can be practical. The central government is obligated to bear the post-war expenses in the bandit areas and is making every effort to raise funds. All the funds for treating the symptoms have been allocated in full, and a portion of the funds for treating the root causes has also been allocated. In the future, we will continue to strive to raise funds to meet urgent needs. Educational expenses, part of which will be taken from land tax surcharges, are being considered so that we can take care of both. Hubei Province's request for independent education fees, because what it requested is the salt tax, which is related to the entire issue, must also be considered. The road construction fees for the seven provinces were originally allocated from the US cotton and wheat loans. The project is progressing rapidly, and the original plan has been fully completed. A new plan is now underway. There has been no road along the Yangtze River, which has greatly affected industrial production. In order to meet the needs of the times, the construction of roads is necessary." Regarding the silver issue, the world is paying attention, and our country is a silver-using country, so we must not ignore it. We are currently studying it in detail and investigating the national silver situation, and soliciting opinions from the provincial governments in order to comprehensively decide on a method, aiming for mutual benefit between the national economy and the people's livelihood." Mr. Kong's entourage included Xu Jianping, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, Secretary Tan Xian, Counselor Li Yuwan, Qian Cunzhi, Deputy Director of the Central Bank's Confidential Affairs Department, and Adjutant Zhou Huang. Mr. Kong stayed at the Central Bank, and Mrs. Kong and Mrs. Chiang stayed at Yih Village. That evening, Mr. Kong discussed important matters with Zhang Xueliang, and then summoned Jiang Han Customs Superintendent Xi Debing, Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Bureau Director Li Rongkai, Mining Tax Office Director Zhu Shenshao, Salt Affairs Inspection Office Director Yao Yuanlun, and Unified Tax Bureau Director Xie Fencheng, and attended a banquet for officials and bankers. Because the financial conference is about to open, Mr. Kong was unable to stay for long and is scheduled to inspect Hunan on the 10th. He Jian specifically telegraphed Yin Deyang, Director of the Hunan-Hubei Railway Bureau, to represent the welcome and accompany him to Hunan. Zhang Xueliang also plans to inspect Hunan and may travel with Mr. Kong. (9th)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Jiangsu Construction Department Promotes Rural Sideline Occupations in Jiangbei: Implementation Plan Approved, Utilizing Abandoned Land for Production <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Jiangsu Construction Department, noting the worsening rural economy in Jiangbei in recent years and the increasingly simple livelihoods of farmers, who rely solely on the cultivation of wheat, cotton, rice, and miscellaneous grains as their source of income, which is no longer sufficient to cope with the increasingly complex modern social life, seeks to remedy and improve the situation. In addition to striving for improvement, enrichment, and reform, it should also promote various rural sideline occupations. Therefore, the organization of a Committee for Promoting Rural Sideline Occupations in Jiangbei has been established. After repeated meetings and discussions, an implementation plan for promoting rural sideline occupations in Jiangbei was drafted and approved by the 656th meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. The guiding principles are roughly as follows: (1) Utilize wasteland, vacant land, and gaps for planting or raising livestock; (2) Utilize abandoned water surfaces for raising fish, turtles, or oysters, and utilize rivers, lakes, and seas for collecting various aquatic products; (3) Utilize farmers' spare time and energy to engage in various agricultural livestock, agricultural product manufacturing, or handicrafts; (4) Utilize joint credit to borrow funds from outside sources to regulate finance and develop production; (5) Utilize agricultural products as raw materials, or purchase raw materials from outside, and within the possible scope, utilize machinery to process and refine them, or utilize leftover and waste materials to produce more products, thereby increasing their value; (6) Inspect the supply and demand of various rural sideline products at home and abroad, and select those businesses with development prospects that can plug leaks and promote beneficial rights to be undertaken first. All of the above should be linked to the main agricultural occupation, and the promotion of sideline occupations should not hinder the main occupation of profitable production. The scope of promotion is divided into (1) Planting category, including crop cultivation and horticulture; (2) Animal husbandry category, including animal husbandry, poultry farming, beekeeping, and sericulture; (3) Handicraft category, including agricultural product manufacturing and rural handicrafts; (4) Forestry category, including tree planting, bamboo forest production and manufacturing, and forest product collection and hunting; (5) Aquaculture category, including aquaculture, fishing, algae harvesting, moss harvesting, shellfish harvesting, and all aquatic product manufacturing. The promotion methods are divided into investigation, publicity, oral publicity, written publicity, material object publicity, training personnel, recruiting trainees, establishing specialized training classes, establishing women's work-study classes, holding lectures, establishing people's livelihood factories, or vagrant skills training centers. School teaching materials should pay attention to sideline occupations. The types of promotion should be determined based on the situation of each county in Jiangbei, and the types of sideline occupations that should be promoted urgently in each county at present are decided below (omitted).</p>

<p>Since the city and township telephone of this county was taken over by the province last month, the Ministry of Communications Telephone Bureau, due to its long-distance telephone business relationship, plans to remove the three lines that were borrowed to connect the urban area. However, if this matter is implemented, the city and township telephone will inevitably be equal to a formality, which is opposed by all parties. However, the company is forced to comply with the order of the ministry and is in a dilemma. Currently, eight representatives of township heads selected by each township district set off for Beijing on the 9th to petition the Ministry of Communications, requesting that the three lines not be removed in order to maintain communication.</p>

<p>Xia Jun, the 18-year-old daughter of Xu Ludong, a resident of Huangxu Town, Zhenjiang, is now a female worker at a certain cloth factory in Changjing, Jiangyin. A certain factory staff member wrongly accused Xia Jun of stealing four yuan, and sent a letter to her family, urging them to take her back quickly. After receiving the letter, Xia Jun's father, Ludong, took his wife from the town by car to Wuxi on the 7th, and went to Changjing. That night, he hired a small boat in Changjing and took his daughter back. He asked her about the truth. When the boat passed the Sanruan Bridge area, about four miles away from Zhangjing Bridge in the Seventh District of this county, because it was too late to drive to the city, it was anchored in front of the Yuanji Cocoon Bank of the Chamber of Commerce at that place for the night. At about 12 o'clock, Ludong woke up and unexpectedly found that his daughter, Xia Jun, had disappeared. He searched with a light, but could not find her. The next (day) morning, he reported to the second squadron and third detachment of the police stationed in the cocoon bank, and took out Xia Jun's photo and left a note stating the mailing address, asking them to help find her. Ludong then took the original boat to Wuxi, transferred to a rice cart and returned to the town. It was not until about 5:00 pm that day that Xia Jun's body suddenly floated in the river in front of the cocoon bank. Mei Shengbao, the chief of the 461st Tu, then pulled the body to the shore and sent someone to guard it, and reported to the local court in the city, requesting an autopsy. After receiving the report, the Prosecutor's Office, led by Prosecutor Ren, Wang the coroner, and bailiffs, took a wheel to the countryside at 7:00 am yesterday (the 10th) to conduct an autopsy. It was confirmed that she had fallen into the river and died before her death. After the autopsy, he ordered Tu Zheng to temporarily coffin her body and wait for the corpse to be claimed by her family. The reason for Xu Xiajun's death this time was nothing more than that she was wronged and unable to vent her anger, so she committed suicide by drowning.</p>

After sending police to investigate and confirm the facts, he planned to take Sun Linhai and others to the office, but they had all fled without a trace. Patrol Officer Yang reported the situation to the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday (the 9th), in addition to ordering the arrest of the fugitives, the Public Security Bureau also ordered a letter to be sent to the County Inspection Office to send personnel to conduct an autopsy for investigation and handling.</p>

It has been approved by the Construction Department. It is planned to entrust the road to Lu for management. The method is that the roadbed is lent out by the public, and the road surface is laid by Lu and Lu Zhou two managers. From the completion of the road and the opening of traffic, a nine-year patent will be given. After the expiration, it will be taken back by the public, or a method of extending the extension will be determined. The company will first pay a deposit. As soon as the contract is signed, the road surface can be organized.</p>

<p>Due to the uneven warm and cold weather this year, the early batch of silkworms in the four townships of Xiaoshan was mostly damaged. Now it has passed the second sleep, but most of them have changed, and the sleep heads are uneven. There are also many who eat wet leaves and vomit yellow water. The late batch is in the first sleep, and the silkworms' bodies have also changed a lot. Except for the improved silkworm species in the eastern township, which shows a slight advantage, the western and southern townships are even more irreparable. Therefore, very few cocoon factories are preparing to open. It is difficult to be optimistic about the problem of villagers selling cocoons.</p>

<h3 id="e115">### Zhang Ji Returned from Fujian Yesterday, Talking About Japan's Lack of Movement in South China, the Remaining Bandits in Fujian Province Can Be Suppressed Soon, Zhang Returned to Beijing by Night Train that Evening to Report Back <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Chen Zhaoying, the special commissioner of the Fujian Party Affairs, took office in Fujian a few days ago. The Central Committee specially dispatched Zhang Ji, a member of the Central Committee, to Fujian to supervise the oath. Zhang completed the official duties on the 8th and took the Wanshiang Wheel of the Sanbei Company with Di Ying, the secretary of the Central Political Council, to leave Fujian and return to Shanghai via Beijing. He arrived here at 12:30 pm yesterday and berthed at the Mishao Wharf on 16th Pier. Mayor Wu specially sent Secretary Huang Jianfen to board the ship to welcome him. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent more than 20 police officers to stand guard around the ship's port. After Zhang got off the ship, he went directly to Haige Road to meet Mayor Wu. At 11:00 pm that night, he took a night train back to Beijing to report back. The reporter of the Central News Agency met with Zhang on the ship yesterday afternoon and made the following remarks:</p>
<h3 id="e116">Japan Has No Movement in South China <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>According to Zhang, there have been rumors recently that Japan is actively planning to invade South China, and that Japanese consuls held a conference on the other side in Taiwan, etc. During my stay in Fujian this time, I stayed for several days and did not see any movement by the Japanese side, so I don't know the details. We should deal with the Japanese side's conspiracy calmly and calmly respond. If we only talk in vain, it will be of no help. As for my trip to Fujian this time, it was purely to represent the central government in attending Mr. Chen Zhaoying's inauguration ceremony, and there were no other tasks.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Order in Fujian Province Gradually Restored <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Order in Fujian has now been gradually restored. Fujian Province was originally a prosperous area with many products. At present, it is urgently necessary to devote efforts to the development of transportation. Special attention should be paid to the downstream area of the Minjiang River, so that the products of Fujian Province can be transported and sold to other provinces. Fujian's finances are currently extremely difficult. Xu Fu, the director of the Department of Finance, will go to Beijing within a few days to ask the central government for remedial measures. As for the construction of Fujian Province, it is currently difficult to develop due to economic difficulties. I sincerely hope that the financial circles of Shanghai will go to Fujian to invest, so that the rich resources of Fujian Province can be developed, and all construction can be relied on to progress.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Suppression of Bandits Shows Progress, Suppression Can Be Expected <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the military affairs of bandit suppression in Fujian Province, with the efforts and cooperation of the party, government, and military, there has been considerable progress. The period of suppression can be expected soon. People in Fujian Province call the rebellion of Chen Mingshu and others this time the "Fujian Rebellion" in the newspapers, which is quite dissatisfied, because this rebellion was the rebellion of Chen Mingshu and others, not the rebellion of the Fujianese. I hope that my comrades in the press will correct it. Zhang, along with Di Ying, secretary of the Central Political Council, and Li Shijia, a member of the Fujian Provincial Committee, took the night train to Beijing at 11:00 pm last night.</p>
<h3 id="e119">### Jiangsu Provincial Government and Shanghai Banking Syndicate Established Construction Loan, Totaling 1.5 Million Yuan, Guaranteed by Provincial Business Tax <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Shen Baixian, the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the director of the Construction Department, recently actively promoted construction projects and completed the Liutang River project and important highway projects in various counties. He specially established a 1.5 million yuan construction loan with various banks in Shanghai. The contract was signed yesterday. The loan will be allocated in succession after July. The reporter of Shenshi News Agency specially interviewed the banking syndicate and the representatives of the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday to learn the details, which are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e120">Participating Banks <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>This time, the Jiangsu Provincial Government approached Shanghai to negotiate a loan, totaling 1.5 million yuan, all for construction purposes. Chairman Chen, Director Shen, and others entrusted General Manager Xu of Jiangsu Provincial Bank to approach various banks in Shanghai separately. Now it has been completely successful. The participating banks and the amount of the loan are: Bank of China, Jiangsu, and Jiangsu Farmers, 300,000 yuan each. The remaining 600,000 yuan will be borrowed by Transportation, Jin City, Mainland, Salt Industry, and Zhongnan, 100,000 yuan each, totaling 1.5 million yuan, and Jiangsu is promoted as the representative bank, responsible for receiving and delivering the loan and handling repayment procedures. All loans, except for the Bank of China, which will be released by the Beijing branch, and the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, which will be released directly by Zhenjiang, will be delivered to the Jiangsu Bank in succession for remittance to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance for verification and collection.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Contract Content <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The loan contract between the two parties has been signed, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government has also approved its establishment. The content of the contract is: (1) The term of the loan is set at one year; (2) Starting from July 1 of this year, 125,000 yuan will be repaid every month until the end of June next year, when the entire amount will be paid off; (3) The interest rate is set at 9% per week; (4) The business tax revenue of the entire province will be used as the collateral for the loan. According to the business tax revenue of Jiangsu Province, the annual budget is about 2 million yuan, but the actual collection varies from year to year, but it will not be less than 1.5 million yuan in total. Jiangsu Bank was originally the agency bank for the provincial treasury. Each month, 125,000 yuan will be deducted from the business tax revenue and distributed to each bank in succession until it is fully repaid.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Use of Loan <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The use of this loan is specifically designated for dredging the Liutang River in Jiangbei and for transportation highways. The Liutang River is very important for the irrigation of farmland in Jiangbei and is part of the Huai River diversion project. It has been carried out in segments since January of this year. Each section of the project has been completed by 60% to 70% and will be completed soon. However, due to the huge amount of money required and the urgent need for it, the project can be carried out smoothly and the completion can be seen early after the provincial government actively plans for the establishment of this loan. As for the highway network in Jiangsu Province, it is under construction actively. All trunk roads in the province are planned and repaired by the Construction Department. However, because the ground in Jiangsu Province is vast and the bays are winding, the required expenses are also huge. In the future, it will also be allocated from this loan in order to complete it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e123">### Qian and Dai Go Abroad for Inspection, Qian Delivers Speech Before Departure <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Qian Chengxu and Dai Gengxin, members of the China Industrial Federation, went abroad to inspect industries. They boarded the Italian mail ship Conte Verde at 9:00 pm last night and set sail this morning. Qian delivered a speech before his departure, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e124">Stabilize Flour Prices <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Qian first said that since the work on stabilizing flour market prices began, it is still under negotiation with the government. Although the government has accepted the principles proposed by the Industrial Federation, the steps and methods are still under consideration by the government. However, the Industrial Federation's proposition is to establish a minimum market price as a principle, in order to raise the foundation of flour. In the short term, it is expected that there will be considerable measures, so that the miserably falling flour mills can be slightly saved from their dangerous situation.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Factory Inspection <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The government has repeatedly advocated for the simultaneous implementation of factory inspections nationwide. However, due to jurisdictional issues within the concessions, the matter has been submitted to the current National Labor Conference for discussion. I am honored to serve as a consultant to the capitalist side of this year's Labor Conference and will do my utmost. However, whether or not this case should be brought up is a matter for the entire delegation to decide. In my personal opinion, Chinese production has reached a state of extreme decline. Factory inspections must be conducted by personnel with adequate training who understand the technical and managerial aspects of factories in order to achieve tangible results. Otherwise, it will not only be ineffective but may also lead to disputes.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Southwest Investigation <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Southwest Industrial Investigation Team has been formed and has already dispatched Mr. Zheng Yi, secretary of Wing On Textile Company, to conduct a preliminary investigation. He is expected to return to Shanghai within the year. Mr. Zheng has made several reports on various industrial issues in the Southwest. He will invite many domestic manufacturers with excellent products to transport their goods to the region to open up markets and simultaneously support the development of existing local industries, such as the pottery industry in Guangxi, which is already relatively well-established. The local Bureau of Industry and Commerce has sent a written invitation to pottery engineers to travel there soon to study improvement methods.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Japanese Formation of New Consortium for China: Banking Sector Has Not Received Report; Refusal to be Expressed if Such Circumstances Arise in the Future <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, it has recently been reported by the Japanese side that Mr. Suma, the Japanese Consul-General in Beijing, and Mr. Uchina and Mr. Kanai, have been negotiating in Shanghai for several days regarding the issue of reorganizing old debts owed to China and plan to form a new consortium for China, adding that due to the limited strength of the Japanese side, they are trying to persuade various banks in Shanghai to join, and that the negotiations are becoming concrete, etc. Yesterday morning, a Central News Agency reporter inquired about this with the Chinese and foreign banking sectors in Shanghai. It is understood that the extent of the contact between the Japanese Consul-General in Beijing Mr. Suma and the Japanese financial sector is unknown to foreigners. However, the idea of forming a banking consortium and persuading various banks in Shanghai to join is merely speculation. The Chinese and foreign banking sectors in this port have not received any written or verbal invitations from the Japanese side. Various banking sectors have also stated that if such circumstances arise in the future, they will definitely refuse.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Other Items <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Finally, Mr. Qian also stated that the China Industrial Association has made great progress in its work in recent years. During my trip abroad, I have entrusted Mr. Hu Xiyuan to temporarily act on my behalf. The following are the plans that are scheduled to be actively carried out within six months: (1) the publication of the *Industrial Times*. This publication will specifically publish the status of Chinese industry with the goal of promoting the development of Chinese industry. It will be published in both Chinese and Western languages and will be promoted abroad in the future. Ten major factories have already been established as basic shareholders, and work can begin soon. (2) the establishment of a Standards Committee, which has been understood by the Ministry of Industry. The main purpose of this committee is to identify various commodities for the purpose of promoting strength and to maintain and promote genuine, good domestic products, with the aim of ensuring the future development of domestic goods.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Sino-Japanese Outstanding Issues: Possibility of Direct Negotiations <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, regarding the possibility of direct negotiations between China and Japan, a certain dignitary stated yesterday that this is not impossible and will depend on the proposals made by the Japanese side, in other words, the subject matter of the negotiations. If they truly insist on forcing us to recognize the puppet organization, this is absolutely impossible. Otherwise, the resolution of various outstanding issues between China and Japan, as is being discussed outside, is still possible. Our country is an independent nation, not a protectorate of any other country. Therefore, our diplomacy also has its own independence. Moreover, there are many outstanding issues between China and Japan, including the Sino-Japanese Treaty, consular jurisdiction, and water and electricity negotiations, among others. If such problems are resolved, it would be welcomed by us. The reason why our country opposed direct negotiations in the League of Nations in the past was that Japan wanted to use gunboat diplomacy to force us to recognize its so-called Five Principles (that is, the Five Principles proposed by Japanese representative Yoshizawa after the September 18th Incident). Therefore, we opposed it. Later, after the puppet regime was established, Japan wanted to force us into direct negotiations to recognize the puppet organization, so we refused again. In short, direct negotiations are not impossible. Any negotiations that force us to recognize or involve the loss of sovereignty and humiliation of the country are impossible.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Second Water Cutoff at Peide Lane, Xinzha Road Yesterday Afternoon; Company Refuses Payment by Tenants on Behalf of Landlord; Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to the Municipal Council Forwarding Original Letter from Representatives <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The water cutoff dispute at Peide Lane on Xinzha Road, after water had been restored, it was suddenly cut off again, which greatly angered all the tenants. A meeting was held yesterday to discuss how to respond, and assistance was requested from all sectors. Mr. Wang Xiangu, a lawyer representing the tenants of the lane, responded to the water company's letter, which has also been forwarded to the Municipal Council by the Taxpayers' Association. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Company Refuses <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The water cutoff dispute in the lane has been protracted. After the company automatically restored the water supply a few days ago, the situation had become calmer. At 10:45 a.m. on the 9th, the tenant representatives of the lane, Liu Chengyong and Wang Jieqing, accompanied by lawyer Wang Xiangu, brought cash of $500 to the company for negotiations, intending to show consideration for the company by prepaying water bills for one and a half months on behalf of the landlords. Unexpectedly, the company refused to accept payment, saying that a contract must be signed first. The representatives replied that if they wanted to sign a contract, they would have to follow the authorization of the general assembly, and they could not act on their own. They then made an appointment to go again on the morning of the 10th. Upon returning, a general assembly of all tenants was convened that evening, attended by more than 150 people. It was decided on the spot that a one-sided contract was unacceptable. If the company cut off the water again, they could only let it happen.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Another Water Cutoff <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>At around 10:00 a.m. on the 10th, the two representatives, Liu and Wang, acting in accordance with the decision of the general assembly, went to the water company again for negotiations. The company still insisted that a contract must be signed first as a condition for accepting payment. The representatives then stated that if it was absolutely necessary to sign a contract first, then the contract must state that the water bills paid were on behalf of the landlords, because the landlords in the lane had not deducted the water bills included in the rent and returned them to the tenants, and the tenants could not bear a double obligation. However, the company resolutely refused, and the negotiations ended without result. Unexpectedly, when the representatives returned to the lane at 11:35 a.m., the water supply in the lane had already been cut off by the company at 11:30 a.m.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Request for Mediation <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>After the water cutoff, at around 3:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the same day, the tenant representative of the lane, Liu Chengxiong, accompanied by lawyer Wang Xiangu, went to the Municipal Council to explain the process of the water cutoff and requested mediation. Mr. He Dehui, a council member, received them and expressed his willingness to forward the request. Last night, the tenants of the lane convened an executive committee to discuss how to proceed with the negotiations and decided to issue a declaration requesting assistance from all sectors, expressing their determination to persevere to the end and never yield.</p>

<p>Lawyer Wang Xiangu, representing the tenants of the lane, sent a letter to the Taxpayers' Association, stating: "We are writing to you on behalf of all the tenants of Peide Lane on Xinzha Road. We have recently received a reply from the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, which quoted a reply from the Public Concession Municipal Council stating, 'We acknowledge receipt of your letter regarding the water cutoff at Peide Lane. Upon investigation, it is found that one clause in the contract mentioned in your letter is not applicable in this situation, because the landlord is acting in accordance with Section 2(e) of the water rate schedule of the contract signed between this Bureau and the Shanghai Water Company on May 5, 1933 (should be May 3), which states that the company will sign contracts separately with each household in a batch of houses. Furthermore, the clause mentioned in your letter does not state that "the water supply cannot be cut off," but rather that "the water company is not bound by restrictions." There seems to be some misunderstanding about this matter, which should be clearly explained. The current unfortunate dispute seems to be purely a dispute between the landlord and the tenants. We hereby reply accordingly.' Upon investigation, the application of Section 2(e) of the water rate schedule in Part C of the contract signed between the Bureau and the water company on May 5, 1933 (actually May 3) should be after the landlord has deducted the water bills included in the rent and returned them to the tenants. In this case of Peide Lane, the water bills have always been paid by the landlord and included in the rent. Before the landlord has deducted the water bills and returned them to the tenants, it is the same as the water bills still being paid by the landlord. Therefore, the provisions of that section should not be invoked. Even if the landlord has requested the water company to install separate water meters and have the tenants pay their own water bills, it is only an expression of intent. If he does not actually fulfill the refund of the water bills included in the rent to the tenants, the landlord is still in a state where he should be responsible for paying the water bills. Therefore, the provisions in the contract that the water company must not cut off the water supply in houses where the landlord pays the water bills, if there are people living in the house, should be invoked. The principle is very clear. The water company did not investigate whether the landlord had refunded the water bills included in the rent to the tenants and, upon receiving the landlord's request to have the tenants install separate water meters, cut off the water supply immediately, which is evidence that the water company colluded with the landlord to oppress the tenants. The Municipal Council knew that it violated the contract but did not correct it, which means that they jointly violated the contract and automatically lost their right to exercise their functions and bear the trust of the taxpayers in the entire concession. As for the statement that the provision in the contract that the water supply must not be cut off does not state that "the water company must not cut off the water supply" but rather that "the water company is not bound by restrictions," it is even more a distortion of the law. The tenants request that the same clause in last year's contract, as printed by the Municipal Council in the Chinese-language Public Bulletin, No. 22, Vol. 4, of May 26, 1933, on page 340, section (e), subsection 3, be copied as follows: 'Regardless of the circumstances, if the water bills for a house are paid by the landlord, the company has no obligation to comply with the landlord's request to stop the water supply to all or part of the house as long as the house or part of it is still occupied, and the landlord is still responsible for paying the full water bills.' According to the above, the water bills for Peide Lane are 'paid by the landlord,' and since the landlord has not deducted the water bills included in the rent and returned them to the tenants, he is still in a state where he should be responsible for paying the water bills. The landlord's request to the water company to install separate water meters for the tenants is, in fact, 'the landlord's request to the company to stop the water supply to all of the house.' The water company naturally 'has no obligation to comply.' It should be known that the Municipal Council's invitation to merchants to operate the water supply is originally to fulfill the important responsibility entrusted by the taxpayers, so that the water supply, which is essential for life, is never lacking, for fear that the water company may be deceived by the landlord or collude with him to use water cutoffs to oppress the tenants. Therefore, there is this provision. The main subject of the clause is the resident, and the legal relationship between the landlord and the water company is 'water supply' and 'payment.' If interpreted from the opposite perspective, it is even more sufficient to fully demonstrate the thoroughness of its protective significance: (1) The water company agrees to the landlord's request to stop the water supply, 'protecting the landlord'; (2) If the house is occupied, the water company must not stop the water supply, 'protecting the tenants'; (3) Even if the water company does not stop the water supply, but the water bills for the house are paid by the landlord, the water company can still seek compensation from the landlord, so that it will not suffer losses. The tenants are taxpayers and should make every effort to protect the clauses that protect the tenants. Fortunately, the water company was able to realize its mistake and automatically restored the water supply at 2:00 p.m. on the 5th of this month, which is a good demonstration of the British people's willingness to correct their mistakes. It is hoped that the Chief Executive of the Municipal Council will strictly enforce this provision against the water company in the future and that such inhumane behavior will not occur again. Furthermore, the water company's breach of contract in cutting off the water supply for as long as twenty days has caused the tenants deep and heavy spiritual and material suffering and losses. In addition to declaring that the misunderstanding mentioned in the Municipal Council's reply does not exist, we specifically entrust you to send this letter to the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, requesting that it be forwarded to the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council to inform the water company to quickly express its apologies and compensate for the corresponding losses in order to show the company's sincerity in faithfully complying with the contract. We hereby report the facts and request that you handle the matter accordingly. Sincerely, Wang Xiangu, Lawyer."</p>

<p>The Taxpayers' Association forwarded a letter to the Municipal Council, stating: "We are writing to you regarding the water cutoff dispute in Peide Lane on Xinzha Road. We previously received your Bureau's reply and have forwarded it accordingly. We have now received a letter from lawyer Wang Xiangu, representing all the tenants of Peide Lane, regarding the corrections to your Bureau's previous reply. We are sending the original letter along with a copy of the same and request that you handle the matter accordingly. Sincerely,"</p>
<h3 id="e147">Ministry of Finance Instructs Provinces and Cities to Exempt Cotton Yarn and Flour from Business Tax <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>In order to eliminate the difficulties in collecting business tax and to resolve disputes among manufacturers, the Ministry of Finance has clearly interpreted the measures for exempting branch offices of factories that have already paid the consolidated tax from business tax and has consulted with various provinces and cities to instruct them to comply. The following is an excerpt from the original letter from the China Cotton Yarn Mill Association to the Cotton Industry Control Committee: "Upon investigation, our country's production is backward, business is sluggish, and manufacturers are facing difficulties, which are matters of great concern to the Ministry. Previously, we approved the measures for exempting cotton collection points of various cotton mills from business tax and issued orders to various provinces to comply. Later, we also approved a letter from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, which forwarded a letter from the Shanghai Flour Mill Industry Association, requesting that the collection of business tax from branch offices of various flour mills by the finance departments of various provinces be prohibited according to law. We believe that it is feasible to exempt branch offices of various manufacturers from business tax if they are only for sales and liaison purposes. We have further clarified the measures for exempting branch offices from business tax and issued orders to various provinces and cities to comply. The case of exempting branch offices of yarn mills and flour mills from business tax has been finalized and there should be no more disputes.</p>
<h3 id="e148">The Tianjin Tooth Tax Bureau Detains Fresh Fruit Case: Lu Wenshao and Others Go to Beijing to Petition, Seeking the Abolition of Disguised Likin <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Since the Tianjin Tooth Tax Bureau detained the fresh fruit of Shanghai fruit merchants, it has led to a strike in transportation. The industry has sent representatives to Tianjin to negotiate with the authorities, but to no avail. Yesterday, they again petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for protection. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce immediately appointed Standing Committee member Lu Wenshao, along with industry representatives Cai Runshen, Xu Runsheng, Xu Yunqing, and Tianjin fruit merchant representatives, to go to Beijing today to petition various ministries and departments. They also carried a petition, the original text of which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Presented for the matter of petitioning, it is reported that the fruit and produce industry claims that the tooth tax originated in the Qing Dynasty. The original purpose of creating this tax was to include the nature of restriction and management, which is the same as the modern so-called franchise business, and the meaning of levying a special business tax. Likin, on the other hand, was created during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi military uprisings. Judging from its historical origin and the nature of tax collection, it is completely different from the tooth tax.</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China, the tooth tax method has still followed the Qing system. The general rules in various provinces are roughly divided into two types: sticker tax and annual tax. Stickers are divided into long-term and short-term. Tax is paid once when renewing. The annual tax is paid annually. The amount of tax depends entirely on the commercial prosperity and the size of the business in the tooth industry area. It is divided into several levels, and each level is further divided into several grades. In short, the tooth tax is a behavior tax, not a goods tax. The target of the tax is the tooth industry, not ordinary vendors.</p>
<p>From the perspective of its behavior tax, it is similar to the business tax implemented in recent years. Therefore, Article 20 of the Business Tax Law formulated by the Legislative Yuan and Article 11 of the Supplementary Measures to the General Outline for the Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces promulgated by the Ministry of Finance all allow it to be temporarily collected separately according to the original tax rate as a transitional measure.</p>
<p>Because the tooth tax is different from the likin collected on goods and does not conflict with the order to abolish likin, the central government, in order to take care of local tax revenue, temporarily does not hold it accountable with the business tax, but allows it to retain its original tax rate. This is a point that those who handle the tooth tax in various provinces cannot ignore, and it is also a point that merchants and people who pay taxes according to law cannot ignore.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the target of the tooth tax, its scope is limited to the tooth industry and does not include vendors. For example, the same fruit and produce, if it is self-buying and self-selling, rather than acting as an intermediary broker, it should pay business tax, not be forced to pay tooth tax. This is not only based on the literal meaning, it should be the case. According to the Business Tax Law and the General Outline for the Collection of Business Tax, it is also a necessary conclusion.</p>
<p>However, the so-called tooth tax in Tianjin is very different from this. Without discussing others, just taking the Tianjin Fresh Goods Tooth Tax Regulations related to the association as an example, its tax collection method is: "At the beginning of the goods entering the market, according to the usual practice, the market price is estimated in advance, and the tax is paid first, and the pass is issued" (quoted from the Tianjin Municipal Government's reply to the Hebei Provincial Government). Once it lands, tax must be collected. This is clearly the nature of the old landing tax. As for its method of issuing tax bills and setting up checkpoints, the Tianjin Municipal Government also stated in its reply to the Hebei Provincial Government that "All collection points within the city can consider the local situation and set up checkpoints at any time to facilitate collection and avoid theft and leakage." The setting up of checkpoints for the tooth tax is a shocking thing for merchants, but the Tianjin authorities consider it a natural measure. Hebei is known as a province that has already complied with the order to abolish likin. It is difficult to understand why the official documents have such wording. (Omission)</p>
<p>Shanghai merchants, due to disputes over tax laws in Tianjin, resulted in the seizure and auction of fresh fruit shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin in February of this year by the tooth tax contractors there. The point of contention is that Tianjin's collection points only have two locations, namely Xihe and Yuhe. Those within the area are mostly tooth industries and have the obligation to pay commissions and taxes. However, goods shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin Haihe are either in transit or are self-sold and have no obligation to pay tooth tax. The contractors, however, want to collect as much as possible, forcibly taking and plundering. The association dispatched representatives to Tianjin to negotiate with the tax authorities. After mediation, a method was agreed upon on April 14. For fresh goods coming from the south and going to the north, warehouses and merchants with similar properties to the tooth industry should pay taxes according to regulations, paying cash temporarily. Vendors should keep accounts temporarily, and the money should be deposited in designated banks. In the future, they will petition the central government to determine whether vendors who are not tooth industries should pay the tooth tax uniformly according to the law and then decide whether to return the deposits.</p>
<p>Since this matter is to be presented to the central government for a final resolution, the association summarizes the opinions of the members and requests the following:</p>
<p>(1) The tooth tax levied in Tianjin is a disguised likin, which hinders the general order to abolish likin and is fundamentally illegal. The central government should first issue a clear order to stop and thoroughly reform it.</p>
<p>(2) After the abolition of this disguised likin, in order to maintain local tax revenue, the original tooth industries and warehouses with similar tooth industry properties should be classified and re-levied business tax, while vendors who buy and sell themselves should be levied business tax according to the business tax collection regulations of various provinces and cities.</p>
<p>(3) If, after assessing the situation, it is temporarily impossible to re-levy business tax, the tooth tax should also be issued according to the general tooth tax practice, graded and posted.</p>
<p>(4) Vendors and tooth industries are two different natures after all. The tooth tax should be strictly defined in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Civil Code to clarify the business boundaries and avoid disputes.</p>
<p>The association requests that the above requests be forwarded to the central government for correction in accordance with the law, and personnel should be dispatched to lead the petition to Beijing.</p>
<p>It is found that the association's request is purely based on the current tax law and is a reasonable request. It is necessary to eliminate the malpractices similar to likin. It is reasonable to recommend Standing Committee member Lu Wenshao to carry the petition and go to petition. It is hoped that the central government will review it and handle it separately as requested by the association to maintain the tax law and comply with the general order to abolish likin. This is truly for the public convenience.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Rong Zongjing Discusses the Truth Behind the Decline in Flour Prices <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The market value of flour is declining day by day, and the future of the flour industry is in dire straits. The Ministry of Industry sent Section Chief Liang Shangdong to Shanghai to investigate the reasons for the decline with flour merchants in order to provide relief. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Rong Zongjing, a giant in the flour industry, yesterday morning to inquire about the reasons for the low flour prices and the relief methods. He answered in detail. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e151">Reasons for the Decline in Value <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The recent decline in the value of flour is unprecedented in decades. The widely circulated reason is that there is a backlog of unsold goods, but this is not accurate. There is no backlog of unsold flour in various markets. The real reasons for the decline in value are: 1. The reduction in sales; 2. The low price of wheat.</p>
<p>The main sales market for flour has always been the three northeastern provinces. Before the three provinces were occupied by the Japanese, more than 12 million bags were shipped from Shanghai and Tianjin each year. Now, they have all been seized by Japanese merchants. According to reliable surveys, Japanese flour shipments to the Northeast reach more than 1 million bags per month. Therefore, the good flour market has been completely seized by Japanese merchants. The low price of wheat can reduce the cost of flour, but because sales are sluggish, the value of flour is declining even more.</p>
<h3 id="e152">The Situation of Reduced Production in Flour Mills <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Flour mills in various places have reduced production due to stagnant sales. Taking Shanghai as an example, it used to be able to produce more than 60,000 bags of flour per day, but now they have all reduced production. Although the number of reductions varies from factory to factory, the average reduction is about 60%. The decline in the flour market can be seen from this. The high cost of transportation in the interior and the inability to abolish excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies are also major reasons for the decline of the entire flour industry. Because transportation costs are high, the difference between flour prices and wheat prices is too great, and people in the interior make their own flour, which invisibly reduces sales.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Relief Measures for the Decline <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Rong believes that it is necessary to immediately find ways to alleviate the decline in the flour industry. Relief measures cannot be effective with empty words. The Ministry of Industry has no financial resources to provide effective relief due to the emptiness of the national treasury. Therefore, I believe that the current relief measures are: (1) Reduce inland transportation costs and abolish various miscellaneous levies (the transportation costs of Australian flour and Canadian flour to China are lower than those from Shanghai to Shandong); (2) Reduce the interest rates on loans to relieve the difficulties of merchants, but this is not easy to do.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association convened its 167th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at its office on La Fayette Road, Rue Belles Road, in the French Concession at 7 p.m. last night. The committee members present were Shen Junru, Wu Zhengxiao, Yang Zhihao, Zhu Fuju, Mao Yun, Ma Junshuo, Hu Jue, Li Ming, Zhou Xiaoan, Chen Zhigao, Guo Shouyi, Zhang Zhengxue, Wang Weizhen, Yan Yinwu, etc., a total of fourteen people. Shen Junru was elected as chairman, Dai Jixian recorded, and the meeting was held as usual. The details of the meeting are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Reporting Items:</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Justice approved the request to order the prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court to lift the ban on lawyers meeting with unindicted detainees. It should not be discussed. Decision: Inform all members.</p>
<p>(2) The Secretary's Office of the Shanghai First Special District Court replied to the request to improve the methods of maintaining order by the security guards, which will be instructed to the security guards at any time. Decision: Notify the original proposer, member Yu Zhongluo.</p>
<p>(3) Member Zhang Yaozeng replied to the nomination to draft a request to the Ministry of Justice to suspend the collection of fees for lawyers' notifications. He felt that all the reasons for the collection had been stated in detail by the various lawyers' associations. In addition, there was nothing to add. Regardless of the nature of the notification, it could not be said that it was not a document related to civil litigation, so it was difficult to avoid collecting delivery fees. Another petition would be futile. The original file was returned. Decision: Submit the case to the general meeting for discussion. On the one hand, nominate member Hu Jue to draft a document to the Legislative Yuan to add amendments to the Civil Procedure Law Amendment.</p>
<p>(4) Member Wang Jian replied that the embezzlement and injury reported by Chen Rusong were not facts. Decision: Notify the original reporter, Chen Rusong.</p>
<p>(B) Discussion Items:</p>
<p>(5) The Lawyers Association notified that the revision of the articles of association was due to the failure of the meeting. It has now been agreed that the nine nominated associations should pay attention to the draft articles of association of the Lawyers Association of the Republic of China that were previously issued. It is requested to notify them. Decision: Print and distribute the original draft articles of association to all executive and supervisory committee members and ask them to sign and submit their opinions to the association.</p>
<p>(6) Gao Jian, a lawyer from Jiashan, reported that Zhang Peilin, a judge of the Jiashan County Court, prohibited lawyers from acting as agents and publicly insulted them.

<p>The development of China's radio industry has progressed rapidly in recent years, and the number of ships equipped with radio equipment has increased even more. Maritime communication depends on connection, and navigation safety is becoming more and more stable. However, the service personnel of each ship are scattered in various places, and there are few opportunities for contact. Moreover, there is no way to seek academic research, communication discussions, treatment improvements, and legal rights protection. In response to social needs and for the welfare of the public, the China Merchant Ship Radio Operators Welfare Association was planned and established by the China Merchants Bureau's Sanbei Ningshao and other merchant ship companies and submitted to the Seafarers Special Party Department for record. It has now been approved and issued a license. It is now soliciting members and actively preparing, and it will be formally established soon.</p>

<p>According to the Zi Lin Bao, it was widely rumored in Shanghai last night that the Portuguese defendant Baptista, who was defrauded of a huge sum of money from McCallie Bank, had been released after being escorted to Macau for trial by the Portuguese court.

<p>The North American Guanghua Match Factory in Chenjiadu Ham, Shanghai, was secretly stolen by foreman Wang Jisong, Wang Liangyu, etc., who secretly stole a large number of important machines, large and small steel knives, various wooden models, etc. from the factory and transported them to Suzhou. A large-scale factory building similar to that outside the Gate of the Lingering Garden Gaolu was built, named Tianyuan Iron Factory. The machines and other parts were installed, and when they were recruiting shares at the beginning of last month, the manager of the factory, an American named Blanc, noticed it, reported it to District 6, and the police detained the thieves Wang Jisong and other eight people one after another, and sent them to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. District Chief Tan ordered the detectives to go to Suzhou to recover a large amount of stolen machinery, steel knives, etc., as reported in the previous report.</p>
<p>It is now learned that District Chief Tan of District 6, because he found that there were still many missing stolen parts from the factory in addition to those that had been recovered, specifically dispatched detective team leader Wu Kezhong and detectives Cao Zhangqiao, etc., along with the American Alecson and two coppersmiths sent by the factory, to Suzhou by car the day before yesterday to go to the factory. After a detailed search, another large number of stolen machines, a total of 149 large and small pieces, and 19 various important wooden models were recovered, packed in boxes, and transported back to Shanghai yesterday morning, brought into District 6, to await verification.</p>
<p>According to another rumor, this machine is very novel and difficult to purchase. The foremen had a whimsical idea to steal the model of the machine in order to set up their own factory. It is unknown whether this is true.</p>

<p>Xu Zhongfu (originally named Xu Shisun, also known as Shaoxi), a habitual gambling scammer who specializes in setting up gambling schemes to defraud money, was sentenced to six months in prison in the Public Concession for committing a crime in his early years. Unexpectedly, after being released, he was still incorrigible and colluded with gangs to defraud as before. There are many victims.</p>
<p>In the winter of the year before last, Chen Songtao, a broker from Sichuan Road Securities and Commodities Exchange, a Ningbo native (26 years old, formerly residing at 316 Sapose Road, later moved to 15 Green Yang Village, Connaught Road) intended to sell his broker's license at a price because he had no intention of engaging in speculative business. Xu saw the advertisement and thought it was an opportunity not to be missed. He immediately wrote to Chen, falsely claiming that someone wanted to buy the license, and invited Chen to Xu's house at 6 Xinle Lane, South Chengdu Road to discuss the matter face-to-face. After receiving the letter, Chen thought that Xu was the real buyer, so he went there on January 17 of last year. The two met and felt like they had met late.</p>
<p>At this time, Xu introduced his accomplices Dai Deru and Zhang Tieshan to Chen, and after talking, they felt more and more speculative. Afterwards, they met every day and became closer and closer. One day, as the four were sitting and chatting, a young man with a smoky face, about 30 years old, wearing beautiful clothes, behaving extravagantly, speaking with a Beijing accent, and carrying a leather bag, suddenly came in. When he entered the door, he pretended not to know Xu and Zhang, pretending to have come to Xu's house to fulfill an appointment with someone surnamed Dai. When Dai saw the young man arrive, he first pretended to introduce him to Xu, Zhang, Chen, etc., saying that the young man's name was Xu Jinqing (that is, Xu Sanyuan, who is actually Xu Zhongfu's younger brother), the descendant of a wealthy Qingdao merchant. Recently, because the chairman of Shandong Province, Han Fuqu, wanted to force him to donate money to purchase military supplies, he secretly smuggled a huge amount of family property to Shanghai, etc. After a short talk, the young man left.</p>
<p>Then Dai described the young man's background in detail, saying that the young man liked to gamble on Guangdong-style Fan Tan. At this time, Xu suggested to Zhang and Dai that he (referring to Xu) had a sure-win method of Fan Tan, which could make the young man hooked. In a short time, we (Xu called himself) can become rich overnight, etc. At this time, everyone tried their best to persuade Chen to join. Although Chen declined repeatedly, he finally agreed to the request because he could not refuse. However, as a result, Chen was defrauded of a huge sum of 3,500 yuan. At that time, Chen was still in the dark and had no doubts. He still associated closely with Xu and others, hoping that the broker's license would eventually be sold formally.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after Xu and others defrauded Chen of a huge sum of money, they gradually distanced themselves from Chen, and then there was no news. At this point, Chen recalled the past and suddenly realized that he had been deceived by these people. He was about to negotiate with them, but Xu had heard the news and first moved to No. 86 in a secluded alley opposite the Dian Dang next to the Mali Shi Vegetable Market on Dagu Road, then moved to No. 127, No. 38 Meibaige Road, and finally moved to No. 126, No. 727 Gordon Road, etc. But Chen had discovered all of them. After repeated negotiations, there was no result.</p>
<p>Chen then reported to the Gordon Road Police Station and Labor Sheng, the district chief of District A, who ordered that if they were seen in the future, they could be arrested. At 5:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, Chen Songtao, Zhang Lianqing, and friends Gu Zhuqing and Pan Hairu were in a car, passing by the entrance of the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road, when they saw Xu Jinqing standing at the entrance. They got out of the car and grabbed him. Xu Jinqing claimed that this matter was done by Xu Zhongfu, and he was now in room 331 of the hotel. They might as well go upstairs to negotiate. Chen then followed him upstairs. Unexpectedly, the two Xus beat Chen severely, causing injuries to his waist and eyes. At that time, Hua Detective Li Wenbin of the General Patrol Room happened to pass by and heard about the incident. He immediately called the Old Gate Police Station and ordered detective Yang Guanying and a Western detective to come and bring everyone to the police station. Chen vomited blood three times in the police station and was sent to Renji Hospital for examination and confirmed that the injuries were real.</p>
<p>Because the two Xus had definite residences, they were not detained. The First Special Court issued a summons, and the two Xus were summoned to court yesterday morning. Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted according to Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and requested that they be punished according to the law. Chen Songtao then submitted a report on the above-mentioned process, and Pan Hairu testified that Xu Zhongfu and Xu Jinqing did beat Chen. Chen Songtao also hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to file a civil lawsuit, requesting compensation for damages of 500 yuan.</p>
<p>When questioned, the defendant denied beating Chen, saying that he was actually beaten by Chen and others at the time and had injuries to be examined. He also hired lawyer Wen Chao to defend him. Judge Deng Baosun reviewed the confessions and announced in court that Xu Zhongfu and Xu Jinqing were jointly found guilty of injuring the body of another person and were each fined 200 yuan and compensated the plaintiff for medical expenses of 30 yuan.</p>
<p>However, it is heard that the plaintiff Chen Songtao was extremely indignant after this strange humiliation. Although the injury aspect has been concluded, he still wants to continue to accuse Xu et al. of fraudulently obtaining money.</p>

<p>The National Goods Movement Exhibition Fair in Penglai Market in this city was originally scheduled to open on the 15th of this month. The preparatory office of the association has been actively preparing for the past few days, sparing no effort. Now, due to successive letters from member factories requesting a postponement of the event in order to arrange at leisure and expand publicity, it was resolved at the second preparatory meeting yesterday to postpone the opening to May 30th. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e161">Preparatory Committee Meeting <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The second preparatory committee meeting was held at 7 p.m. last night. More than ten people including Chen Binghui, Jin Weixuan, Yan Shanlin, Chen Hanquan, Liu Zhongying, Wang Jingdong, and Wu Shunsheng attended. Liu Zhongying chaired and Zhou Zhaolin recorded. After performing the ceremony as usual, the chairman reported on the progress of the preparations. Then the secretariat reported on letters from Guohua Industrial Society and other companies, stating the reasons for the postponement. Most of the national goods factories participated in the Nanjing National Goods Exhibition, resulting in insufficient manpower. It was proposed to hold the exhibition after the closing of the Nanjing National Goods Exhibition. It was resolved to postpone the opening to May 30th so that each factory could arrange and expand publicity at leisure. The meeting adjourned after discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Postponement Notice <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>For the matter of notification, it is approved that member Yonggu Box Factory, Yongan Industrial Company, etc. stated in their letters that members, etc., participated in the Hunan National Goods Exhibition and the Nanjing National Goods Exhibition respectively. Due to the conflict in time, the lack of manpower, it is proposed to postpone the event until after the closing of the Nanjing National Goods Exhibition so as to fully allocate employees and rush to produce goods as much as possible.</p>
<p>This association convened a preparatory meeting to discuss and resolve to postpone the opening until May 30th. There will be no further delay. The record is on file.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to promote widespread publicity, expand the display section, solicit national goods products, and implement effective exhibitions, this association has allocated 50 square feet in the field as a display department. All national goods factories in the city are requested to transport their products to the association, participate enthusiastically, and the temporary business district has few remaining spots. Participate as soon as possible to avoid being left out due to being full. This is very important.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Dr. Joseph Rock Arrives in China to Assemble Tibet Exploration Team <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Our Shanghai office of the foreign news agency reports that Dr. Joseph Rock, the world-renowned American botanist, arrived in Shanghai on the 8th aboard the President Coolidge. He is staying at the Metropole Hotel. It is said that his purpose in coming to China this time is, like Dr. Rogers, an authority on silver issues, under the orders of President Roosevelt to investigate the actual situation in China. After arriving in Shanghai, Dr. Rock immediately visited the American Consulate General to discuss future research directions. While the American Consulate General has vigorously clarified that Dr. Rock's arrival in China does not contain any political nature, the fact that Dr. Rock is a powerful member of the American Geographical Society and that his main purpose in coming to China is not only to inspect the actual conditions of rural areas everywhere, but also to advocate an expedition movement in the Chinese border area centered on Tibet, makes his future activities and the United States' policy towards China regarding the economic development of the entire country worthy of attention. Furthermore, this inspection of Tibet is based on the orders of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Dr. Rock plans to form an exploration team with twelve personnel dispatched by the U.S. Department of Commerce, who will arrive in Shanghai soon. They are expected to depart in September, first taking a passenger plane to Lanzhou, Gansu, and then heading into Tibet as a team.</p>
<h3 id="e164">The Stranded Emei Steamer Escapes Danger After Years of Stranding – Costs a Staggering 120,000 Yuan – Finally Freed by Rising Waters <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Emei steamer, which ran aground upstream of Fuzhou in June of last year, has been under rescue and towing operations for ten months, costing a staggering 120,000 yuan. It was only yesterday that the shipowner, Ji Qingrong, telegraphed that the Emei steamer had escaped danger on the morning of the 9th due to rising waters and is now going to Yichang for repairs before returning to Shanghai for major repairs at the shipyard. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e165">Ten Months Aground <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>In June of last year, the Emei steamer ran aground on Huatanzi reef, upstream of Fuzhou. The hull was stranded on the reef, and the bottom of the first two or three compartments were all cracked. Because the company believed the ship, which cost 400,000 taels to build, was in excellent condition, it decided to rescue it. At that time, a Westerner named Pitotchen was entrusted to carry out the salvage. Later, the chief captain, Shen Jiyun, was sent to find a way to repair the holes in the ship. Just as they were about to tow it into the water, the upstream river water receded greatly, and the entire superstructure of the ship was destroyed, resulting in a loss of all efforts. After the water receded, the Emei was suspended high on the reef, a dozen feet away from the river, until today, a period of ten months.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Cost of 120,000 <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>During these ten months, rescue work has been continuous, with costs reaching 120,000 yuan. Of this, Pitotchen alone spent more than 60,000 yuan. This year, in preparation for the great rise in the spring waters of the Sichuan River, it was towed out by hiring a large number of workers and purchasing a large amount of dynamite. First, the reef under the bottom of the Emei was blasted and removed in February, and then they waited for the time to tow it. The ship was insured for 130,000 yuan, and all rescue costs, in addition to a portion allocated by the company, were paid by the insurance company. Today, the final cost of 6,000 yuan must be remitted to the ship for the shipowner to pay.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Ship Escapes Danger on the 9th <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the water level of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has risen sharply. At 3:00 AM on the 9th, the Emei steamer floated out of the pile of rocks on its own during the rising water. At that time, the water in the upper reaches was extremely turbulent, and all the wire ropes attached to the Emei were broken by the water. This shows how urgent the situation was. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received a telegram from shipowner Ji, stating that the Emei had escaped danger at 3:00 AM (on the 9th). All fourteen steel wire ropes on the ship were broken, and the bottom of the ship was slightly damaged. They have urgently telegraphed to Yichang to hire river-going ships to immediately sail to Yichang for preliminary repairs. Upon receiving the report, the company also ordered the newly appointed Deputy Captain Li to take a riverboat to Yichang to take office immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Major Repairs in Shanghai After Arrival <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The company now plans to have the ship slightly repaired in Yichang, and then order the shipowner to sail it to Shanghai for major repairs at the shipyard. Last year, the company originally planned to have the Emei converted to a special express train on the Jinghan Railway, but the accident caused this plan to be shelved. Now, the company intends to have it sail on the Sichuan River after it is repaired, and there is no intention to operate a special express train on the Jinghan Railway for the time being. Regarding the damage to the cargo on the ship, the passengers have already filed claims with the insurance companies. However, one foreign insurance company refused to pay, and the case is being litigated in the Sichuan court. Because it does not concern the company, they will not intervene.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Qian Shaofeng Kills His Father's Enemy and Willingly Goes to Prison – Yesterday Applies to Withdraw Appeal – Only Asks to Be Imprisoned Without Shackles <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Qian Shaofeng, also known as Peihao, a young student from An'nan County, Guizhou Province, is twenty-one years old this year. He was studying in Shanghai last year and resided at No. 13 Yuanchang Lane, Hualong Road, in the French Concession. His father, Qian Bin, had served as the director of the Finance Bureau in his hometown. Four years ago, he was kidnapped and killed after failing to be extorted. At that time, Qian had just been married and heard rumors that he was also in danger. He fled alone and studied in Shanghai, Hankou, Beijing, Tianjin, and other places before returning to Shanghai, always harboring the ambition to avenge his father. In October of last year, he encountered his father's killer, He Zunfu, a fellow villager (who had served as the magistrate of An'nan County), residing in the Datong Apartment on Beile Road in Shanghai. He then hid a knife day and night, following He. On the evening of the 15th of that month, He went to the Huangjin Grand Theater to watch a movie, and Qian also bought a ticket to enter the venue to assassinate his enemy. At that time, He was injured and shouted wildly. Qian was unable to escape and was arrested by the detectives and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. Later, He died of his injuries. The police changed the charges against Qian to murder and filed a lawsuit. The Second Special Court transferred the documents to the An'nan County Government of Guizhou to verify that Qian's father had indeed been killed. Considering that Qian was motivated by righteous indignation, he was sentenced to seven years in prison. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Qian expressed dissatisfaction with the original sentence as being too heavy and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, requesting a reduction of the sentence. The Higher Court, based on the petition, concluded the investigation. The trial was held the day before yesterday by Judge Guo Dechang, together with Assessors Sun Honglin and Fan Peien, and the prosecutor. The appellant still retained lawyer Qian Shusheng to defend him. The judge asked the appellant Qian Shaofeng about the reasons for the appeal and explained the advantages and disadvantages of the appeal to him, instructing Qian to think carefully about whether to proceed or stop. Qian was moved by the words and applied to withdraw the appeal in court, requesting that the court not impose shackles during imprisonment and that he be willing to serve his sentence peacefully. At that time, everyone in the audience was moved by Qian's words and admired his ambition to avenge his father. As a result, the court instructed that the prison be notified when the sentence was executed and ordered him to be returned to the detention center to await imprisonment.</p>

<p>Bian Songlin, a native of Yangzhou, residing at No. 75 Baoxing Lane, Dongxin Bridge Street, French Concession, is thirty-three years old this year. He used to work in a yarn factory, but has been unemployed recently. Because he is addicted to opium, he makes a living by selling red pills. At about 8:00 AM on the 29th of last month, he hid four bags of red pills (totaling 4,000 pills, worth more than 30 yuan) in a handbag and, together with Feng Jinsheng (age 44, from Wuxi), a tailor, planned to transport them to the mainland for sale. When they passed the iron gate at the intersection of Minquan Road and Xinqiao Street in the French Concession, Ni Lianxue (age 31, from Jiangbei), a Chinese policeman of the French Concession Police Station, saw that Bian and others looked flustered and suspicious. He stopped them for inspection. Bian begged for help to get through. The policeman took Bian and Feng, along with the red pills in the handbag, to the nearby Yuanshang Lane and colluded with Liu Lianyuan (age 45, from Ningbo), the gatekeeper of No. 762 Lane, to extort 40 yuan from Bian. Bian agreed to give 20 yuan, but the policeman refused. After the police officer Xie persuaded him, Bian agreed to pay 30 yuan. However, Bian had no money on him and had to go home to find a way. The policeman ordered Bian's companion, Feng Jinsheng, to guard the handbag there and ordered the policeman Liu to accompany Bian home to get the money. Liu waited at Bian's house for about half an hour and, unable to wait any longer, returned to Yuanshang Lane first, instructing Bian to find a way quickly. Bian borrowed and pawned items everywhere and, after three hours of delay, managed to raise only 17 yuan. He entrusted Lu Qiaogen (age 32, from Wuxi), Feng Jinsheng's nephew, to deliver the money to Yuanshang Lane. The two policemen, Ni and Liu, refused to accept it because the amount was too far off. They told him to find a way again. Lu returned the money to Bian Songlin. Bian then pawned 30 yuan, making a total of 20 yuan, and ordered Lu to send it again. At that time, it was already 11:45 AM. Policeman Ni, seeing that the time difference was only fifteen minutes and Bian's money could not be collected, immediately turned hostile and took Feng, Lu, and the handbag containing the red pills to the police station, reporting to the police chief that Bian Songlin had escaped. The police chief interrogated Feng and Lu about Bian's address and sent detectives to arrest Bian, confiscating an opium pipe from his home. The next day, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court and charged with Article 13 of the Opium Prohibition Law, requesting that the defendants be detained for further investigation. Later, the Western detective chief of the police station, Peng Shitian, ordered Bian and the other three to be interrogated. Bian confessed that the two policemen, Ni and Liu, had colluded to extort 30 yuan and, failing to do so, had been arrested and sent to the police station. The detective chief then summoned the two policemen, Ni and Liu, to the case for questioning. Ni denied it outright, while Liu confessed everything. The Western detective chief, seeing that the case was clear, reported to the chief patrol and dismissed the two policemen, taking them into custody together. Yesterday, they were also sent to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, presided over by Judge Wang Gangxu. The police lawyer, Yuan Jiahong, stated the facts of the case, charging Bian, Feng, and Lu with Article 13 of the Opium Prohibition Law and charging Ni and Liu with Article 129 of the Criminal Law for dereliction of duty and soliciting bribes, and submitted the red pills, opium pipes, and pawned clothes, gold rings, and pawn tickets to the court. After the court separately interrogated the defendants, under the defense of the lawyers retained by the defendants, the court announced the end of the debate and adjourned the hearing for sentencing. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>The *Da Mei Evening News* reports that, according to news this morning (the 10th), the Human-Powered Vehicle Management Office is currently drafting a concrete plan to issue licenses to rickshaw pullers, based on Article 7 of the Human-Powered Vehicle Committee's report. The first step is to verify the physical fitness of approximately 55,000 rickshaw pullers, based on four pullers per vehicle and one puller per privately owned vehicle. It is said that at the beginning, the physical examination will not be very strict, and only those whose physical fitness is clearly unsuitable will be refused a license. After the initial work of issuing licenses is completed, the office will gradually tighten the requirements and proceed with the other articles of the report. It will pay particular attention to the fact that the rental fee for each vehicle for 24 hours should not exceed 80 cents, as this article has been adopted by the Public Works Department and has the force of law. However, it remains to be seen whether the rickshaw companies will comply.</p>

<p>The Northwest Mobile Exhibition of the National Products Sales Association, originally scheduled to close registration for manufacturers on the 10th and for all members to depart for Kaifeng on the 15th, has now been rescheduled by the first committee meeting because the products of the newly participating factories have not been packed in time. The deadline for filling out waybills has been changed to May 12th, and the goods will be directly delivered to the new railway warehouse at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road at the North Station from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM on the 16th. As soon as the products are delivered, they will depart for Kaifeng for a two-week exhibition, and then move to Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xi'an, and other places for exhibitions in sequence. However, due to inconvenient transportation and high transportation costs in Lanzhou, it has been decided that the products will be transported by car for exhibition only and will no longer be sold.</p>

<p>The Two-Way Railway Administration received instructions from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating that, according to a telegram from the Longhai Railway Administration (Xiao), "Upon investigation, star anise is a medicinal material, although it can be used as a spice, but its value is low. If it is charged according to the sixth category of spices in the craft category, it seems to be too high. Can it be charged according to the fourteenth category of fennel seeds in the agricultural product category? We hereby telegraph for verification and compliance." Star anise is a spice in food and can also be used as a medicinal material. Its value is slightly equal to that of fennel seeds and should be charged according to the fourteenth category of fennel seeds in the agricultural product category. In addition to separate orders, you should immediately be informed. This order has been forwarded to the Transportation Department for information.</p>

<p>A male corpse was found dead in Nanlai Lane, Kulun Road, Zhabei, the day before yesterday. After the local bailiff reported it to the Shanghai Local Court and requested an autopsy, the prosecutor sent an official to perform the autopsy in the morning. The corpse had already been collected by his cohabitant, Ye Hongsheng, and the coffin had been sent to Pushan Villa. However, Gong Xikui, the district chief of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, believed that the case involved a human life and could not be collected without verification by the court. Therefore, he ordered the local bailiff to report it to the Shanghai Local Court again and request an autopsy. The local bailiff then transferred the coffin to the court for autopsy according to the court order. Yesterday morning, the local bailiff and others followed the order to transport the coffin from Pushan Villa to the court's autopsy room. At around 10:00 AM, the prosecutor ordered the coffin to be opened. The autopsy revealed that the deceased, Cao Guiting, had indeed died of poisoning. The corpse was immediately handed over to the local bailiff for return. At the same time, the court telephoned the Zhabei Branch of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, instructing them to send the relevant suspects in the case to the court for interrogation. Gong immediately summoned Wang Jinsheng, age 47, from Shanghai, residing at No. 20 Xinmin Lane, Xinmin Road, the bailiff's assistant in charge of custody, and Jin Asi, age 33, from Chaozhou, residing at No. 34 Sanwei Lane, Manchuria Road, who was involved in collecting the corpse, and Che Yongqing, age 10, from Jiangyin, the son of the deceased, for a brief interrogation. Jin Asi testified that Che Yongqing was the son of the deceased. Che Yongqing said, "Cao Guiting is my father, whose surname is Che, not Cao. The surname was mistaken due to mishearing the pronunciation." After the judge verified the testimonies, he immediately ordered them to be sent to the Zhabei Branch of the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for transport to the Shanghai Local Court for interrogation. It is also learned that yesterday morning, a person claiming to be a staff member of the Ministry of Industry came to the Wuzhen Road Police Station and strongly requested to waive the autopsy, speaking rudely. The police station expelled him because the case had been reported to the court. Therefore, the circumstances of the case are quite bizarre.</p>

<p>The Jinglong steamer of the Hengkang Company, the shipowner's suicide after running aground at the port of Xiamen, has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the ship is not represented by Shao Gubao Cai Foreign Firm, because the shipowner, Mr. Yu Jingshan, is the Chinese manager of Shao Gubao Cai and has attached the Hengkang office to the firm. The ship is still stranded on the rocks and is already unloading cargo for rescue. A follow-up report is detailed below.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Amount of Cargo <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The Jinglong steamer was originally named the Huaxing steamer. It was mortgaged and advanced by Mr. Yu to start his own line. The hull is 1,600 tons and was originally built in the UK more than 20 years ago. It now runs along the Xiamen-Guangdong route. The cargo exported from Shanghai this time is mostly rice, wheat flour, bran, and cardboard. The cargo loaded to Xiamen is 16,222 pieces, and to Guangdong is 8,866 pieces. Therefore, it will go to Xiamen first.</p>

Unexpectedly, they received a telegram from Xiamen yesterday afternoon stating that the ship had run aground in the waters off Xiamen Port yesterday morning due to fog. The front cabin was flooded, and all crew members were rescued, but the shipowner, Boyike, committed suicide. The ship is being rescued, and a further report will be made after receiving another telegram from Xiamen.</p>

<p>After the manager of Dihua Shipping Agency in Xiamen sent a telegram reporting the accident, there were no further telegrams to Shanghai. The company waited until 2:00 PM yesterday without receiving a word. The Shanghai company sent another urgent telegram to inquire, stating, "We have understood the previous telegram. How is the ship? Can the cargo be salvaged? Please reply quickly." After this telegram was sent, there was still no reply. They then sent another urgent telegram, stating,</p>
<p>Dihua Shipping Agency, transfer to Jinglong, Chuán hé Cái, the insurance companies are urging urgently. What do you want to do to handle the aftermath? If it can be repaired, please come to Xiamen with the insurance company personnel. Please reply immediately to clarify the truth. Did you know about the two telegrams yesterday? Why haven't you replied? Anxiously.</p>

<p>The Jinglong steamer's hull is insured for 60,000 yuan. Yesterday, the insurance companies were urging Hengkang Jinglong about the extent of the grounding. It was not until 5:30 PM that they received a telegram from Xiamen stating that the Jinglong steamer's hull was stranded on the rocks. The Xiamen office has agreed with the customs to send a ship to the side of the Jinglong to unload the cargo on deck and temporarily store it in the Shanghai Customs warehouse when the tide rises. They are also consulting with the Xiamen Haichuan Dockyard to send a ship to the accident site for rescue. The required expenses will be paid by the customs and then invoiced. The company has forwarded this telegram to the insurance company and will go with the insurance company personnel after the insurance company agrees to send personnel.</p>

<p>Regarding the suicide of the shipowner, Russian Boyike, people in the company said that the shipowner was very responsible after taking office and never delayed the schedule. Although there is no detailed report on the suicide this time, it was probably caused by a sense of responsibility. He believed that the grounding was his fault, which led to the thought of suicide. All 56 crew members and 28 comprador personnel on board have been rescued and are currently in Xiamen.</p>
<h3 id="e182">The Guangzhao Upper Shelf Company Ren De Tang Case is Settled – The Defendant is Willing to Submit Books and Records for Review – A Settlement Record is Drafted in Court <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Chen Enbao and Li Jiafu, former members of the Guangzhao Upper Shelf Company Ren De Tang, were accused of controlling the company's affairs and embezzling public funds, which was reported to the Social Bureau. The bureau ordered the company to reorganize and instructed Lu Bingjie to take over the company's affairs and funds for sorting. However, Chen, Li, and others hid the accounts and refused to hand them over, preventing Lu from proceeding. More than 190 fellow merchants of the company commissioned Lu Bingjie to retain a lawyer to sue Li Jiafu, the former chairman of the executive committee, Chen Enbao, the chairman of the supervisory committee, Qiu Shen, the chief of the general affairs section, and Li Jianfang and Mo Zhuonan, the accountants, for controlling public funds and hiding accounts. The summons from the First Special District Court has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that there are many accusations against Li and others, such as (1) the case of Li Shengsun, the company's accountant, who embezzled 8,000 yuan in ticket money and rent. It is suspected that the five defendants, Li and Chen, colluded in the wrongdoing. (2) Qiu Jie, representing the company, applied to the Land Bureau for a land certificate. The various expenses required should not exceed 2,000 yuan, but the *Credit Record* shows a total of 5,000 yuan spent on gifts, etc. (3) There are as many as 13 cases of falsifying membership lists with Chen Zhong's guarantee or charging fees. (4) Falsifying membership certificates and fraudulently receiving relief funds. It has been found that Huang Tian and Lu Yi were indeed instructed by others. The two have been sentenced by the court in previous years. (5) Arbitrarily reducing the price of the company's property, seeking private gain, disregarding public interest. The proceeds of the sale, 382,000 yuan, have not been disclosed in detail to this day. (6) According to the Ren De Tang's articles of association, monthly income and expenditure accounts should be printed in the *Credit Record* and distributed to fellow merchants to ensure credibility, but since June of last year, it has been almost a year, and this *Credit Record* has been delayed in printing, the accounts are muddled, and they dare not publish them, which is obvious. (7) According to the Trade Union Accounting Regulations, a final settlement statement and a balance sheet of assets and liabilities should be prepared at the end of the year, and an inventory table should be prepared at each settlement period. However, the defendants have not complied with the above matters. (8) According to the Trade Union Regulations, more than one-tenth of the members may request to send representatives to check the union's property. The plaintiff now has a collection of 192 members, which exceeds one-third of all members, to liquidate the accounts with the defendants, which is legal and should order the defendants to hand over all account books, forms, and receipts for detailed verification. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao Wanxuan continued the hearing. The plaintiff's attorney presented the Ren De Tang's membership list and the membership receipt stamped by the defendant Li Jiafu to prove the plaintiff's membership qualification. Then, the defendant's representative lawyer, Chen Zhongyin, defended each of the plaintiff's accusations, and finally stated that the purpose of the plaintiff's request was to review the accounts. The defendant was willing to provide the accounts currently in his possession to the members for review, but the documents submitted to the Social Bureau could not be reviewed from the defendant. Judge Qiao stated that the purpose of the plaintiff's lawsuit was to require account review, and since the defendant had clearly expressed his willingness to hand over the accounts for review, there was no need to litigate. Therefore, he persuaded both parties to settle and drafted a settlement record in court, stating that the defendant was willing to have the plaintiff send representatives with membership certificates or receipts to Ren De Tang to review the account books and receipts currently in his possession, but those submitted to the Social Bureau were not included. Both parties agreed, and the mediation was established. The lawyers for the plaintiff and defendant read each other's copies and agreed, and the parties who appeared in court signed and settled the case.</p>

<h3 id="e184">National Products Industry Sympathy: China-America National Products Showcase Competition, Over Twenty Participants Including Asia Electric Factory <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Major Shanghai national products factories have expressed deep sympathy for the "China-America" National Products Showcase Competition initiated by the China-America Tobacco Company. This is because the China-America Tobacco Company has sacrificed this valuable showcase, opening it to the national products industry, truly setting a model for mutual assistance within the industry. From the perspective of the national products industry, it enables those who love using national products to better recognize the recent progress in national product production, and also provides a public opportunity to explore showcase display techniques. Therefore, in recent days, various factories have been filling out registration forms. Over twenty companies have registered to participate, covering all categories. Here is a list of participants: Asia Electric Factory, Tianchu MSG Factory, Huadong Chemical Factory, Jinglun Shirt and Sock Factory, Yifeng Enamel Factory, Sino-French Pharmacy, Huasheng Electric Factory, Tianyi Pharmaceutical Factory, Huatong Electric Factory, Yonghe Industrial Company, Jiuxin Enamel Factory, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Kailin Paint Company, Huafeng Enamel Factory, Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory, Greater China Celluloid Factory, Dalong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, China Chemical Industry Society, Shuanglun Toothbrush Factory, Dahua Pencil Factory, Dongfang Chemical Factory, Renyu Factory, Daming Match Factory, Yingyin Knitting Factory, Shunfeng Brand Sock Factory.</p>

<p>The French Concession Public Works Department caused a dispute by stopping the issuance of some rickshaw licenses. Since April, representatives of the Rickshaw Association, such as Zhang Huaiyang, have appealed to various parties. They received assistance from Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, and committee member Tong Lizhang, who negotiated with the French authorities. The French authorities agreed to issue 100 additional relief licenses. Together with the remaining 36 licenses, a total of 136 licenses will be distributed by the French authorities in conjunction with the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession and the Rickshaw Trade Association. With the approval of the board of directors of the French Public Works Department, starting from the 7th, unemployed rickshaw pullers approved for relief must find a reputable guarantor within the French Concession and go to the Revenue Office of the French Public Works Department to obtain a license to operate. It is also stipulated that when donating and obtaining French licenses in June, the old licenses from May will be exchanged, and the old licenses registered in October of the previous year will be cancelled in the same number. It is also heard that no more requests for additional licenses will be accepted in the future.</p>

<p>Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province, and others, recognizing that Zhejiang Province lacks a large-scale national products company, which inevitably exposes the Zhejiang market to the dumping of foreign goods, have approved the request of Zhang Zilian and other national products manufacturers in the city to organize the Zhejiang National Products Company in Hangzhou. The proposal has been approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government meeting, which has allocated vacant land behind the National Products Exhibition Hall to build a new building. The construction cost is 400,000 yuan. The plan is to build a four-story building with a basement and a platform for a commercial plaza. The first and second floors will be for commercial use, the third and fourth floors will be for hotels and food sections, the basement will be a warehouse, and the fifth floor (i.e., the open-air platform) will be for an amusement park. The business plan is divided into thirty-six departments. It is reported that Mr. Zhang has recently gone to Hangzhou to discuss the course of action with Director Zeng and Mao Zhongfu, Director of the National Products Exhibition Hall.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Shanghai Machine Industry Association Jointly Investigates Counterfeit Japanese Clocks: Yingfengtai Store Responds That It Is Selling on Consignment; Yesterday, a Letter Was Sent to the Clock Industry Association for Thorough Investigation <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Products Factory Association received a report from the Clock Industry Association stating that Yingfengtai Store in Jiru Lane, French Concession, was selling Japanese clocks with altered appearances, passing them off as national products, and deceiving customers. The 30th Standing Committee meeting of the Association decided to send Director-General Cheng Shouchong and General Affairs Manager He Pengcheng to investigate. The results confirmed the suspicion of Japanese goods and ordered the store to stop selling them. In order to thoroughly investigate the source of these Japanese clocks, a letter was sent to the Clock Industry Association yesterday, requesting them to send personnel to investigate the Minsheng Clock Factory to clarify the truth. The letter stated: "Respectfully, we previously received a letter from your association stating that Yingfengtai Store in Jiru Lane, French Concession, was using Japanese clock parts to assemble wooden cases, fabricating factory names, passing them off as national products, and selling them at low prices. This was discovered by colleagues, and the association managed to purchase a dozen clocks from the store, with invoices as proof. An examination revealed that the clocks had paper labels on the back stating 'Shanghai Minsheng Clock Factory National Product Alarm Clock,' and the inside of the clocks also had 'Completely National Product' paper labels. The clock faces were printed with 'Goose,' 'Lighthouse,' and 'Minsheng' trademarks, and included registration marks. After investigating various clock factories in Shanghai, no factory with the name Minsheng was found. An inspection of the parts confirmed that they were Japanese goods. This is undoubtedly a case of unscrupulous merchants altering the appearance of goods and passing them off as national products. At a time when our country's industry is in its infancy, this unexpected blow is causing the future of national products to be bleak. We have always admired your association as a leader in machine manufacturing, and we are sending this letter to you, along with representatives Zhuang Honggao, Li Weizhai, Wang Zhongzhen, and Hu Qiaqin, to explain everything in person. We urge you to uphold justice, not only for the benefit of our industry but also for the future of national products." Upon receiving this, the 30th Standing Committee meeting decided to investigate the matter. Director-General Cheng Shouchong and General Affairs Manager He Pengcheng were sent to investigate the store. According to the store, the Minsheng Clock Factory was not fabricated and had a signboard on Wuding Road that could be found. They were selling on consignment because of a friend's introduction and the presence of the words "National Product." The Association's investigators informed the store that the clocks were suspected of being Japanese goods and that they should stop selling them until it was confirmed that they were indeed national products, to avoid public anger. They were about to send a letter to report the findings when Yingfengtai sent a letter stating that recently the Association had sent Mr. Cheng and Mr. He to the store to investigate the alarm clocks produced by the Minsheng Clock Factory, based on a letter from the Clock and Watch Association alleging that the store was selling clocks from the Minsheng Factory, completely altering their appearance and passing them off as national products, and that no clock factory in Shanghai had the name Minsheng. The investigation results confirmed the suspicion of Japanese goods and ordered the store to stop selling them. The store responded that it was selling these clocks on consignment because of a friend's introduction. The clock faces had the words "Completely National Product," and the back of the clocks had the words "Shanghai Minsheng Clock Factory National Product Alarm Clock," so they believed they were national products and sold them on consignment. The factory address was indeed in the middle of Wuding Road, with an iron signboard at the intersection. Because the factory indicated that the products were national products, the store was deceived. The Association's opinion should be accepted, and the store will immediately return all remaining stock and will no longer sell them on consignment. A letter is being sent to inform you, hoping you will investigate and respond. The factory should be held fully responsible for passing off goods as national products. Therefore, a letter is being sent to inform you, hoping that you will investigate whether there is indeed a Minsheng Clock Factory in the middle of Wuding Road and clarify the truth.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e195">Organizing Newspapers and Other Matters <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, we revealed the correspondence from Mr. Wang Lansheng, a reader of our newspaper for over twenty years, inquiring about how to read and organize newspapers, as well as the issue of Mr. Wang's son's education. Today, we will briefly respond to Mr. Wang and hope that Mr. Wang will give us his criticisms.</p>
<p>"How to read newspapers" is a question that Mr. Wang raised to us. Mr. Wang said, "Every day when the newspaper is delivered, I flip through it randomly without any plan, and in practice, I don't get any benefit from it." This accurately describes the common problem of reading newspapers for most people, but "flipping through randomly" cannot be immediately said to be "practically useless." Because the "newspaper" is not a "book" after all, and people who read newspapers do not have the same seriousness as when reading books. In the minds of ordinary people, the purpose of reading newspapers is not consciously realized. They read newspapers every day just like they drink tea, smoke, and chat with family and friends. Reading newspapers has become a part of modern people's lives, and they feel depressed and like they have lost something without it. Only then do they become aware of it. There are many people like this in the world. They are both concerned and not very concerned about the events happening around them, and they only casually receive some materials for "conversation aids." You say, is this kind of "flipping through randomly" useless? That's not necessarily true, but the knowledge gained is unsystematic.</p>
<p>As for people who read newspapers with a purpose, their attitude is naturally different from the above. Every day they open "four or five major newspapers," first look at the headlines, and quickly scan the entire newspaper, then carefully look at the parts they want to see. Some people pay special attention to market quotations and trade, some people specialize in studying international issues, some people pay attention to many conflicting phenomena in society, and some people like domestic politics. So each person uses their own purpose to constantly study the occurrence and development process of each type of event, and becomes a specialist in the study of a certain issue.</p>
<p>Reading newspapers should not only have a purpose, but also pay attention to the method of reading. Reading newspapers is not only for the eyes, but also requires your brain to distinguish the truth from falsehood in the news, and your hands to do the work of copying, cutting, and pasting. For example, taking the invasion declaration issued by Japan on April 17 as an example, if you feel that this issue is very interesting to you and you want to study it, you should not only read this type of news every day starting from April 17, but you also have to cut it out and paste it in a newspaper clipping book. Using this issue as the center, collect materials from all aspects, such as the attitudes of various countries towards the declaration, world public opinion, and the understanding and countermeasures of the Chinese government and the public on this situation, and compile them into research materials for one issue.</p>
<p>However, even if this step is done, the task of reading newspapers has not yet begun. Because the above is only about browsing news and collecting materials. The biggest task of reading newspapers is to analyze the situation, dissect the situation, and create a systematic understanding of each event. Regarding this point, it involves a person's purpose and academic ability. This is the most important step in reading newspapers.</p>
<p>As for you personally, we don't know what issue you are currently preparing to study. If you are preparing to study prices, you may wish to start collecting the prices of "clothing," "food," "housing," "fuel," and "miscellaneous items" in your area from now on. When the time comes, make a statistical analysis of the cost of living in your area. Isn't this the most valuable and interesting thing to do? This is what it means to "actually make some contribution." As for you saying that "if newspapers are not for browsing," "then I should start planning to study new books of the times from now on," we cannot agree with this. Because newspapers are living history, a record of human practical life, more important than any book. We very much agree that you should read more "new books of the times," but at the same time, you cannot go a day without reading newspapers.</p>
<p>How should twenty years of old newspapers be organized? We can only offer the following suggestions for your reference. Concrete methods cannot be determined for you, because we still do not know your "purpose" and what kind of organization you can achieve.</p>
<p>First, if you have ample time and can find like-minded people to work together on a certain issue, you may wish to divide the old newspapers from the past twenty years into categories such as international affairs of the past ten years, China's economy of the past twenty years, China's politics of the past twenty years, and the evolution of Chinese society of the past twenty years, and organize them separately. However, this is definitely not something that you alone or thirteen people can do. Even if you do, because the materials from a single Shen Bao are too limited after all, the conclusions reached will definitely not be very rich. However, if someone does it, even if it is not very successful, the collected materials will still have considerable value, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Second, if you cannot use it yourself and feel that "it is a pity to just let worms and rats gnaw on it," why not donate it to people who are capable of organizing these things, experts who are capable of using these materials? We think that for someone as enthusiastic about social causes as you, this is a more appropriate method when the first method cannot be implemented.</p>
<p>Third, is the "binding into volumes and storing them away" that you have already implemented. The best way to bind volumes is to bind one volume per month, with a summary of current events for each month attached, and to make a general summary each year. Elaborate monthly summaries should be decorated on the first page of each volume, and the general summary should be placed at the end of the twelfth volume. This will make it much easier to look up information when needed. This is the method of a collector.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of your son's education after graduating from high school, we are very touched by your concern. You are truly a "father" standing in front of the times, making such serious plans for future generations. Society should also admire you for this. However, in our opinion, the many subjects you listed are both needed and not needed in today's Chinese society. Because Chinese society is currently undergoing major changes, all kinds of sciences are needed, but at the same time, due to social unrest, people with specialized knowledge are also unable to find their use. Engineers become magistrates, and agricultural and forestry experts become secretaries. What they have learned is not what they use, which is very common today. Regarding your son's career choice, we believe that it can be developed in any direction according to the economic strength of your family and his personal interests. But what should be paid the most attention to is: no matter what subject he studies, he must have considerable social science knowledge, and he must clearly recognize the way out for the Chinese masses, which is his own way out. Creating people who stand on top of the masses and apart from the welfare of the masses is not allowed by the times. Although we are very ashamed that we cannot give you a concrete answer on this point, we hope that the above shallow opinions can still be used as your reference!

<h3 id="e197">Far Eastern Games Open Tomorrow; Our Athletes Practice Diligently Without Ceasing; Philippine Sports Association Invites All to Tour the City, Only a Few Accept <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The Venue is Already Presenting a Hot Scene, and Tickets Have Been Almost Completely Reserved.</p>
<p>The Organizing Committee Announces that All Referees for Ball Games are Filipinos.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 10th) At 8:00 AM on the 10th, the Philippine Sports Association invited athletes from various countries to tour the city. Most of our athletes stayed at the venue to practice, and only a few accepted the invitation. The venue is already presenting a hot scene, and many are visiting the practice. Tickets have been almost completely reserved.</p>
<p>(Japan News Agency, Manila, 10th) Chinese and Japanese athletes stopped practicing on the morning of the 10th. Under the leadership of the Philippine Sports Association, they went to the city for sightseeing. They rode in large public buses to the old city's Shiren Street, visited the Gospel Hall Hotel, and various rare buildings. They also went around the tobacco company and the Ice Kirin company. The athletes all enjoyed the local flavors of Luzon and the deliciousness of Ice Kirin. They returned to their dormitories after the tour at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Countries Are Mutually Reconnoitering Strengths <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency, Manila, 10th) Since arriving in Manila, the Japanese athletes have gradually gotten used to the heat and have begun to truly practice. The various competition venues are quite mixed because athletes from China, Japan, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies are all practicing at the same time. In order to bring their physical condition to the best state by the time of the Games, the Japanese athletes avoid the heat of the day and start practicing together in various sports after 4:00 PM when it is cool. During practice, the reconnaissance war between the countries is very fierce, and they are mutually exploring the records of promising athletes. Also, at the Shanghai roundtable conference, the Philippines was advised to adopt a third-country three-referee system for ball games only, but the Philippines did not agree. Looking at the list of organizing committee members announced yesterday, all judges are from the Philippines, which shows that the host country's refereeing system is still adopted. However, the Executive Committee of the Philippine Sports Association expressed its approval of Japan retaining the Emperor's Cup.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Prediction of the Japanese Athletics Coach <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>(Japan News Agency, Manila, 9th) After seeing the practice of the Philippine athletes, Japanese athletics coach Yoshihiro Saku said to reporters, "Although the sprinting track is facing the wind, there is a viewing platform to shield it, so it will not be greatly affected. Japanese Yoshioka's first place in the 100 meters is beyond doubt. Philippine athletes' starting point technique is not skillful, but their physique is excellent, so they have a strong momentum in the second half of the race. In the 200 meters, there will inevitably be considerable challenges between the athletes of various countries. The strength of the athletes in the 400 meters is equal, which is the most interesting. Although the Philippine athlete Andy is famous in the 800 meters, his strength is not worth worrying about. Mr. Yedal has considerable strength and should not be optimistic. In the 1500 meters, the Philippines will still send these two people, while Japan has Uchida, Tanaka, and Tsuyuki, so scoring points will not be difficult. The 10,000 meters is not a problem and will be a solo performance stage for Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Talk of the Japanese Swimming Coach <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>(Japan News Agency, Manila, 9th) Japanese swimming coach Matsuzawa said, "The Japanese athletes are most affected by the intense heat here. The pool water was poured in four days ago, and due to the consecutive days of intense heat, the water temperature has reached over 30 degrees. The strength of the Philippine athletes is unknown, but the willing Fang is a strong enemy. It is heard that he has made a record of two minutes and forty-two seconds, but whether this is a fact is quite doubtful. Nosh and Ali in the 50 meters have a record of 26.2 seconds and may invade the second or third place. The recent results of Kulisch Zhangxun in the breaststroke are one minute and eleven seconds, which is not optimistic.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education Submits to the League of Nations the 1934 Report on Education in China (II)</p>
<h3 id="e222">(II) Secondary Education <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>The three types of schools within the secondary education stage – middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools – have all undergone significant reforms this year.</p>
<p>Since the 1922 middle school system adopted the 3-3 system, with the first three years being junior high school and the last three years being senior high school, normal and vocational courses could be established in senior high schools. As a result, many independently established normal and vocational schools were merged into senior high schools. However, the effectiveness of this was not easily seen. Therefore, in 1933, the Ministry revised the secondary school system, stipulating that normal schools and vocational schools should be established separately, and promulgated and implemented the laws and regulations. The main points are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Middle schools are divided into junior and senior levels, with each level having a study period of three years. Junior high schools enroll elementary school graduates or those with equivalent academic ability. Senior high schools enroll junior high school graduates or those with equivalent academic ability.</p>
<p>Normal Schools: Normal schools enroll junior high school graduates with a study period of three years. Normal schools may establish special normal courses and kindergarten normal courses as appropriate. Special normal courses enroll senior high school graduates with a study period of one year. Kindergarten normal courses enroll junior high school graduates with a study period of two or three years. When there is an insufficient supply of teachers for local elementary schools, simple normal schools may be established, enrolling elementary school graduates for a four-year program, or a simple normal course may be attached to normal schools and public junior high schools, enrolling junior high school graduates for a study period of one year. All types of normal schools are generally public.</p>
<p>Vocational schools are divided into junior and senior levels. Junior vocational schools have a study period of one to three years, enrolling elementary school graduates and those with equivalent academic ability. Senior vocational schools have a study period of three years, enrolling junior high school graduates and those with equivalent academic ability. Vocational schools may, as needed, establish vocational supplementary schools or vocational supplementary classes, enrolling workers engaged in actual production, with varying study periods.</p>
<p>After the promulgation of these laws and regulations, in order to reduce the establishment of normal schools and vocational schools in ordinary middle schools, the Ministry of Education specially stipulated the standard for the distribution of secondary education funds in each province and city, and issued a notice for compliance. The standards are as follows: Vocational school funding shall not be less than 35 percent, normal school funding shall account for approximately 25 percent, and middle school funding shall account for approximately 40 percent.</p>
<p>If the distribution of secondary education funds in each province and city does not meet these standards, it should be gradually increased or decreased from 1934 to 1937 in order to comply.</p>
<p>In order to standardize the graduation level of students in various middle schools and improve teaching efficiency, the Ministry of Education formulated the Middle School Graduation Entrance Examination Regulations in 1932, stipulating that those who do not pass the entrance examination may not graduate. Since its implementation in various provinces and cities, it has been effective.</p>
<p>The general situation of various secondary schools from 1930 to 1931 is described below:</p>
<p>School Type Number of Schools Number of Students Amount of Funding</p>
<p>Junior High School 1,330 227,867 14,791,711</p>
<p>Middle School 554 179,081 20,540,210</p>
<p>Normal School 84 82,809 8,419,140</p>
<p>Vocational School 272 34,852 4,961,996</p>
<p>Total for Provinces and Cities 2,992 514,609 48,713,057</p>
<p>The quantities of all the above items have improved compared to the previous year.</p>
<h3 id="e223">(III) Elementary Education <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Given China's vast territory and large population, the number of school-age children is naturally very large. Compulsory education is difficult to universalize in a short time. In order to promote compulsory education, the Ministry of Education promulgated the Outline of the First Phase Implementation of Compulsory Education Measures in 1932, with 1932 to 1935 as the first phase. During this period, each county and city in the country should designate experimental compulsory education zones in both urban and rural areas. All school-age children in the zones should receive compulsory education. The magistrates and chiefs of public security bureaus of each county have the responsibility to assist in the implementation of compulsory education, and those who fail to do so should be punished. At the same time, in order to help older out-of-school children, the Ministry also promulgated the Implementation Measures for Short-Term Compulsory Education, stipulating that short-term elementary schools or short-term elementary school classes should be established in various places, with the aim of literacy, enrolling out-of-school children aged 10 to 16 to receive short-term compulsory education. The study period is limited to one year.</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of these two measures, the educational administrative agencies in various provinces and cities have implemented them accordingly. It is expected that compulsory education will make considerable progress in a short period of time.</p>
<p>The general situation of elementary education from 1930 to 1931 is briefly described below:</p>
<p>Number of Schools 250,840</p>
<p>Number of Children 10,948,979</p>
<p>Amount of Annual Expenditure 89,416,977</p>
<p>The quantities of all the above items have increased compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Among the provinces and cities, Shanxi Province has achieved the best results in implementing compulsory education. The number of children enrolled accounts for about 80 percent of the total number of school-age children. This is followed by Weihaiwei and Shanghai, which are also around 60 percent. Most other provinces and cities are between 30 and 40 percent.</p>
<p>In addition, the bandit-controlled provinces are also paying special attention to and making arrangements for restoring general education in the area.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Comparison of the Number of Schools, Students, and Funding for Various Secondary Schools Nationwide Since the Founding of the Republic <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has compiled statistics on the number of schools, students, and funding for various secondary schools nationwide since the founding of the Republic.  Here is a summary: (1) In the first year of the Republic, there were 500 middle schools and junior high schools, 253 normal schools, and 79 vocational schools (totaling 832 schools). The number of students was 59,971 in middle schools and junior high schools, 28,605 in normal schools, and 14,469 in vocational schools (totaling 103,045 students). The funding amounted to 3,296,672 yuan for middle schools and junior high schools, 2,040,387 yuan for normal schools, and 1,024,903 yuan for vocational schools (totaling 6,361,962 yuan). (2) In the fifth year of the Republic, there were 653 middle schools and junior high schools, 195 normal schools, and 84 vocational schools (totaling 932 schools). The number of students was 75,595 in middle schools and junior high schools, 24,959 in normal schools, and 10,524 in vocational schools (totaling 111,078 students). The funding amounted to 4,200,412 yuan for middle schools and junior high schools, 3,077,746 yuan for normal schools, and 1,296,901 yuan for vocational schools (totaling 8,575,059 yuan). (3) In the eleventh year of the Republic, there were 547 middle schools and junior high schools, 385 normal schools, and 164 vocational schools (totaling 1,096 schools). The number of students was 118,598 in middle schools and junior high schools, 43,846 in normal schools, and 20,360 in vocational schools (totaling 182,804 students). The funding amounted to 6,600,256 yuan for middle schools and junior high schools, 4,633,919 yuan for normal schools, and 2,790,005 yuan for vocational schools (totaling 14,024,180 yuan). (4) In the fourteenth year of the Republic, there were 687 middle schools and junior high schools, 301 normal schools, and 154 vocational schools (totaling 1,142 schools). The number of students was 129,978 in middle schools and junior high schools, 37,992 in normal schools, and 18,011 in vocational schools (totaling 185,981 students). The funding amounted to 9,540,228 yuan for middle schools and junior high schools, 4,368,262 yuan for normal schools, and 1,760,493 yuan for vocational schools (totaling 15,668,983 yuan). (5) In the nineteenth year of the Republic, there were 1,874 middle schools and junior high schools, 846 normal schools, and 272 vocational schools (totaling 2,992 schools). The number of students was 396,948 in middle schools and junior high schools, 82,809 in normal schools, and 34,852 in vocational schools (totaling 514,609 students). The funding amounted to 35,331,921 yuan for middle schools and junior high schools, 8,419,140 yuan for normal schools, and 4,961,996 yuan for vocational schools (totaling 48,713,027 yuan).</p>
<p>(Explanation) From the first year to the nineteenth year of the Republic, the number of middle schools and junior high schools has increased nearly fourfold, normal schools have increased by three and a half times, and vocational schools have also increased nearly fourfold. The number of students in middle schools and junior high schools has increased sevenfold, normal schools have increased threefold, and vocational schools have only increased by two and a half times. The annual expenditure on middle schools and junior high schools has increased tenfold, normal schools have increased by over fourfold, and vocational schools have also only increased by over fourfold. This indicates that the increase in ordinary middle schools is greater than that of normal schools and vocational schools. At a time when vocational education is being promoted, this kind of development is actually an abnormal development.</p>

<h3 id="e236">A Glimpse of Japanese Education - Lecture by Du Gang, Notes by Qin Guangan and Chen Hekun <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Du recently returned from Japan after inspecting children's education. At the invitation of Tao Guangchuan, principal of the Municipal Jingye Middle School, he gave a report in the school's auditorium on what he saw and heard. The following is a record of his lecture:</p>
<p>Japanese education is best managed at the elementary school level. Elementary school buildings are often large buildings costing hundreds of thousands or even one or two million yuan. On the one hand, their funding is sufficient, but on the other hand, it can also be seen that they attach great importance to elementary school education. They pay special attention to physical education. Almost every elementary school has a very large playground. The physical education teaching materials are mostly apparatus exercises and are very substantial, similar to our country in the 7th and 8th years of the Republic. Every elementary school student can perform very good skills. Their spirit is even more admirable. I remember that when we went to Kobe Kitano Elementary School, it was raining, but many elementary school students were barefoot and wearing only single layers of clothing, practicing diligently and tirelessly on the wet playground. Their physical education teaching materials are almost the same for boys and girls, and male teachers are employed in both boys' and girls' schools, and they are also responsible for the class teachers. This is because they firmly believe that all citizens must have strong physiques. To make the national body universally good, it cannot be entrusted solely to the school's physical education teachers, and the teachers themselves should also have a good spirit. This is their insightful view that physical education should be taken over by the class teachers.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding Japanese elementary school teachers, almost all of them are graduates of the Normal School. At the same time, normal school graduates can only become elementary school teachers. After graduation, they are assigned by the government, and their salaries are about 45 yuan to 80 yuan per month for women, and 50 yuan to 150 yuan as the highest amount for men, based on the teaching performance of each teacher, with salary increases based on the assessment by the inspectors and principals. They attach great importance to the position of principal, and people without very rich experience and virtue cannot be appointed. When we visited Kobe, a 43-year-old principal told us that he was the youngest of the sixty or so elementary school principals in Kobe. Some were even elderly men in their sixties or seventies. This shows how much attention they pay to elementary school education. In terms of moral education in Japanese elementary schools, it is centered on the Emperor. Every elementary school student respects the Emperor, and every elementary school student worships figures who have contributed to the country. There are many shrines in society that display idols of these figures or display their achievements during their lifetime in the form of objects, texts, and pictures to inspire respect. In short, every elementary school student already has the concept of loyalty to the Emperor and patriotism, and the spirit of sacrificing for the country.</p>
<p>Japanese elementary school students have very good discipline. During class, in a school with thousands of students, no students can be seen outside the classroom. They like to wear uniforms, especially old uniforms, because this shows that they are in a higher grade and consider it an honor. At the same time, people in general society also have great respect for these elementary school students wearing old or torn uniforms. This concept is the same for middle school and university students. In terms of the curriculum of Japanese elementary school students, in addition to citizenship, which is the same as ours, there is also a self-cultivation class for training personal self-cultivation. In addition to lectures by teachers, they also have a practice room for practicing various rules of etiquette. Therefore, they have been trained in form and are very polite when they are elementary school students. In terms of equipment, as I said earlier, because funding is sufficient, all kinds of courses are naturally perfect. There are no special classrooms, such as drawing classrooms, handicraft classrooms, music classrooms, history classrooms, geography classrooms, and physics and chemistry classrooms. Their methods and spirit are all focused on practice. For example, in their elementary school handicrafts, the classroom is divided into metalworking, woodworking, lathe working, and sand casting workshops. In addition, they also have a local room, which displays real objects or charts of local products, businesses, customs, and folklore.</p>
<p>When we went to Japan this time, although they expressed a warm welcome on the surface, there were still many very important places that we could not see. Even if we saw them, it was just a fleeting glance, and we rarely had the opportunity to stop and look carefully. Therefore, what we saw was just a general outline.</p>
<p>Elementary schools are like this, and middle schools do not allow us to investigate in detail. I remember once visiting a chemical industrial school, and I only saw that the equipment inside was substantial and the various drugs were very abundant. Their mechanical industrial school is also very large in scale, and I think it can manufacture military supplies when necessary. The various works of the students are quite impressive, and the products are sold outside.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Record of Fragrant Incense Fading <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Because these pouches have no prescribed style or color, you are free to sew them as you wish, according to your own ideas. So all sorts of ingenious styles and bright colors were adopted without limit. However, the function of these pouches was purely decorative; in fact, no one ever used them to hold anything.</p>
<p>As for the belt itself, it was woven with blue silk thread. The color was of course very striking. And to fasten this belt, as usual, there was a buckle. The styles of these buckles were also not prescribed, allowing the wearer to come up with various designs themselves. Thus, this buckle, like the pouch, became a good source of ostentation and showing off wealth. An unexpected, special buckle revealed his own wealth and power. The most common were gold, silver, or copper buckles, the style depending on the wearer's preference, and they were usually different. However, these silver and copper things were, after all, very ordinary materials, only used by lower-ranking officials who were limited by their financial resources. Qing Shan would absolutely not want them! His buckle was carved from the finest jade. My father also had such a buckle, the style was very exquisitely carved. Perhaps Qing Shan himself liked this style, or perhaps it was purely the skill of the jade craftsman, that cannot be known. But I can guarantee with certainty that a buckle like his was worth at least one thousand taels of treasury silver. At the current exchange rate, that would be over one thousand five hundred yuan in national currency. Qing Shan also wore a huge jade ring on his finger, its value probably not far from that of the buckle; so, adding it all up, the value of his entire outfit was at least five thousand taels of silver, equivalent to about seven thousand yuan in today's Chinese national currency. As for how many sets of such outfits he had, that was something no one else could know! A Minister of the Imperial Household had such rich and beautiful clothing, no one could say that he was unworthy. Although, in fact, he still had to rely on Li Lianying's every breath, often getting things to give him as gifts. (31)</p>
<h3 id="e238">Compromising with Ghosts <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Xun Zi</p>
<p>One day, in the courtroom lounge, I met Teacher Yuan Zhonglian. Teacher Yuan was a devout Buddhist and observed the precepts very strictly. He told me that he knew how to perform the Flame Mouth ceremony, which belongs to the esoteric sect of Buddhism and can transcend hungry ghosts. Mr. Yuan also told me an event to prove that ghosts exist.</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan said: After the January 28th Incident, in the Dachang area, a lady was possessed by a ghost. The ghost was originally a company commander of the 88th Division, who spoke pure Hangzhou Mandarin. Because in the underworld, he was cold and hungry, so he asked the lady's family to specifically request the Diamond Sutra. The family inquired everywhere and found that an old nun nearby had accumulated 8,000 volumes of the Diamond Sutra that she had recited, so they bought them all and burned them. The ghost company commander was overjoyed and said that not only he himself, but even the entire company of soldiers under his command, would be transcended!</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan's propagation of doctrine from a Buddhist standpoint is another matter. However, I had other thoughts when I heard it. The Chinese are truly worthy of being a peace-loving people, even compromising with ghosts and gods. When ghosts and gods cause trouble, all they want is some benefits, so they set out wine and food, light incense and candles, and invite the ghosts and gods to eat and drink. Finally, they burn a large pile of silver ingots to make the ghosts and gods satisfied and leave. Alas! The essence of Buddhism is actually to compromise with ghosts and gods!</p>
<p>Christianity is different. They treat demons without ceremony, wanting to expel them. If demons are not easy to get rid of, they fight them until they are victorious. Therefore, in Christian hymns, there are triumphant songs similar to victory songs. It turns out that Christianity is a worldly dharma, and Buddhism's transcendental dharma is fundamentally different!</p>
<p>However, the Chinese are a people who believe in Buddhism, so they specialize in compromise. This is the same as sending ghosts away with wine, food, incense, candles, and paper ingots, a manifestation of the compromising doctrine of "giving him whatever he wants"!</p>
<p>I advise the Chinese not to compromise with ghosts and gods in the future. They should still learn from Christianity and fight demons!</p>
<h3 id="e239">The Utilization of Scenic Spots <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Zuizhu</p>
<p>The scenic spots of Suzhou are not utilized by the people of Suzhou, but are utilized by the Japanese. Their business methods are so pervasive that even Europeans and Americans have to retreat. The day before yesterday, I happened to accompany a few friends to play in Tianping Mountain. As soon as we entered Tongzi Gate, we saw two or three "semi-old guns" rushing up to act as "tour guides." With me, this "guide," by their side, they were naturally refused. But he was still unwilling to give up and followed up, saying, "Gentlemen, when you visit the mountains and rivers, do you want to bring some souvenirs back? I have excellent scenic photos here. Bring a few back to your residence, and it won't be a waste to come out and play once."</p>
<p>My friend was touched by him, so he stopped to look at the photos in his hand.</p>
<p>There was a stack of about a hundred photos. He specially picked out a set of Tianping Mountain photos, ten in total:</p>
<p>"Sir, these are the famous scenic spots of Tianping Mountain, ten in total, only five jiao (cents)."</p>
<p>"Do you have Tiger Hill?" my friend asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," he picked out another set of twelve, "also only five jiao."</p>
<p>As a result, one yuan bought three sets, and my friend was extremely happy.</p>
<p>After playing, we passed by a Japanese shop, "Toyodo," and saw several "semi-old guns" walking out with a large bag of photos. Because we were going the same way, I chatted with them and asked about the origin of the photos: "The Japanese give us this kind of scenic photo, a set of one hundred, every day to hawk to tourists. After selling a set, they give us two yuan and five jiao, and if we don't sell them all, we return them. We poor friends have no capital to do business, and if we can earn eight jiao, who wouldn't want to do it, but you need an introduction."</p>
<p>My friend was very angry when he heard this and tore the photos in his hand in half.</p>

<p>He sat on the bed, feeling depressed all afternoon. By evening, he couldn't bear it any longer and secretly told Jiang about it. Jiang, by now, felt that her son-in-law's father was quite good. Moreover, their attitude towards marriage was to "marry a chicken, follow the chicken; marry a dog, follow the dog." Not to mention that they were very satisfied with their son-in-law, even if they weren't, they couldn't say a word about it to anyone. No matter what, they had to get that handkerchief back. She, like her daughter, tossed and turned in bed all night because of this. The next morning, she deliberately lingered at the door, watching. When she saw a maid from the Gan family come out, she smiled and said, "Aunt Wang, Happy New Year! Is your master at home?" Aunt Wang replied, "The old lady sends you her New Year's greetings. Our master has gone to the market, and the mistress is playing mahjong. No one is home. I'm taking something to the mistress." As she spoke, she held up a jade cigarette holder, smiled, and said, "Taking this to her." Jiang said, "Does your family have any taboos about entering the house? If not, I'll come to your house to see Second Master's illness." (Note: Common custom in some old families, from New Year's Day until the Lantern Festival, women are prohibited from entering the house.) Aunt Wang laughed, "Our mistress even goes to other people's houses to play mahjong, what taboos are there?" As she spoke, she left with a smile. Jiang hesitated at her own door for a while, then slowly walked towards the Gan family's door. After pacing around for a long time, the same Aunt Wang who had delivered the cigarette holder returned and asked her to go to Ji Zhi's room. Ji Zhi was staring out the window in a daze when he suddenly saw Jiang come in. This was unexpected. He quickly reached out from under the covers and made a few fist salutes towards her. Jiang entered the room, not looking at his face, but at his mattress. She stood in front of the bed and asked, "We were all fine when we came back from the theater. How did you become unwell?" Ji Zhi said, "Catching a cold is very easy. I don't deserve the Old Madam coming to see me." (382)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3 id="e244">About Yan Ziling's Fishing Platform <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>I recently read Mr. Chen Shicheng's "Tour of Qililong" in this journal's Spring Outing Special. There was a passage in it: "The fishing platform towers on the mountainside, about two hundred feet above the water. How could one fish from there? Could it be that times have changed, and things are different now than in the past? If this platform were suitable for fishing, then the entire Hangzhou prefecture would be a marshland!"</p>
<p>After carefully considering Mr. Chen's meaning, I suspect that the fishing platform is too high. Yan Ziling could not have cast a line two hundred feet long in those days and caught a bass. This is truly like Yang Wanli's poem from the Song Dynasty: "Fishing stone three thousand feet high, what could one use as fishing line?" It has the same sense of doubt. Even the Yanling Chronicle says: "Yan Ziling's Fishing Platform, there is a stone by the mountain, called the Fishing Altar, facing east and west, over a hundred feet high, overlooking the Great River."</p>
<p>First, in various chronicles before the Song Dynasty, there is no mention of the fishing platform. In the Water Classic Commentary by Li Daoyuan of the Later Wei Dynasty, it only says: "Under Yanling Lai Mountain is a stone chamber, where Yan Ziling lived during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of the Han Dynasty. Below the mountain is a large rock, several tens of yards in circumference, bordering the Jiaoliu Pool, where Ling used to roam." Perhaps from this, someone fabricated the story of the sheepskin cloak by the swamp to describe Ziling's purity. Throughout history, reclusive scholars, such as Shun at Leize, Shangfu at the Wei River, and Zhuangzi observing fish on the Hao River, all used it as a metaphor for the tranquility of human nature. Therefore, it is fitting to say that Ziling fished. Xu Hun's "Below Yanling Terrace, the Tong River flows, how many can fish for bass?" Perhaps he was the first to praise fishing. However, we should know that even though Ziling lived in seclusion in the stone chamber, free from the burdens of military and state affairs, he would stroll to the Tong River when he was happy. But the place where he fished was the large rock at the foot of the mountain, as mentioned by Li Daoyuan! Not the stone pavilion on the mountain, more than a hundred feet above the water!</p>
<p>Second, upon further reading of the gazetteer, it says: "South of Tonglu County is Yan Ziling's fishing place. Today, there is a stone by the mountain, flat on top, where ten people can sit, overlooking the water; it is called Yanling Fishing Altar." The so-called Fishing Altar refers to a huge rock by the river, not a stone pavilion that has been far-fetched. Reading Tang Luo Binwang's imperial edict: "I arrived at Qilitan during the three dog days, this place is the mouth of the Xin'an River. There is Yan Ziling's Fishing Reef there." Here, it is further affirmed that when Yan Ziling farmed and fished in the Fuchun Mountains, there was only a fishing reef, not a fishing platform. The so-called reef is a huge rock by the river.</p>
<p>Third, we can be sure that the two stone pavilions on the summit of Mount Fuchun were definitely not built by Yan Ziling himself. He also did not need to build an altar and then fish; if we further examine the structure of the stone pavilions, they are not architecture from the Han Dynasty. We know that between the stone pavilions, the one on the east side has a plaque that reads "Noble Demeanor of a Thousand Years," which of course refers to Ziling; the one on the west side has a plaque that reads "Leaving a Thread of the Cauldron," which refers to Xie Ao. In fact, Ziling and Xie Ao would never praise themselves. These two pavilions are now equally dilapidated to the same extent. Therefore, I am certain that they were built at the same time. Moreover, in reality, there is no such long fishing line! As for why the stone pavilions are not built on the edge of the water or on the side of the mountain, but must be located high on the summit, there is also an explanation:</p>
<p>Respect for great personalities must be matched with a lofty position. The architecture of ancient Roman churches, with a sacred cross on the spire, is nothing more than wanting people to see this dignified form from afar and generate infinite feelings. Putting the fishing altar high in the clouds is also the same idea. We cannot say that Mr. Chen YingShi could ride a horse in the clouds just because we see his bronze statue by West Lake, right?</p>
<p>From this, we can draw a conclusion: the black rock among the thickets on the riverbank below Mount Fuchun, where fishing boats can be moored, is the place where Yan Ziling cast his line in those years. The stone pavilion on the summit is a building erected by later generations to commemorate Yan Ziling. Moreover, the character "altar" in Fishing Altar is defined in Shuowen as a place for sealing soil and offering sacrifices, containing the meaning of respecting ancestors and commemoration. Therefore, someone guessed that times have changed, worried that Ziling could not fish, and even suspected that Hangzhou prefecture would become a marshland, which is really unnecessary! The transformation from fishing reef to fishing altar, from fishing altar to the tall fishing platform, which is today's stone pavilion, is probably the only reason for the misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Having said that, I still hope that scholars will come up with more convincing evidence to explain when and by whom the existing fishing platform was built; then explaining this small doubt of the general public is not a boring act!</p>

<h3 id="e245">Finance: Silver Faction Has Signs of Internal Strife, Bid Prices Rebound to Three Yuan and a Half, US President Studies Silver Bill, Initial Setback, Foreign Exchange Tight, Central Bank Opens for Cash, Trend is Bullish <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was stable due to conflicting news about the silver bill, a decline in forward silver prices, and a steadying of sentiment. Furthermore, due to settlement relations, the domestic market tightened, and the Central Bank actively opened for cash, making the market bullish. At the close, it rose further. Initially, overseas silver markets in the UK and US had surged, but forward silver prices on the Metals Exchange fell by six to eight and two-tenths of a penny. Exchange rates opened higher, narrowing the gap. London spot gold fell by two pence, US cotton fell by twelve pounds, and US wheat fell by half a point, causing sentiment to turn bullish. It was rumored that the White House had not fully confirmed everything about the silver bill. Spot prices opened at thirteen to fourteen yuan. Reuters reported that President Roosevelt's consideration of nationalizing silver was benevolent, and that the President was receptive to permissive and directive legislation on silver reserves. Although the President opposed confiscating silver coins in the same way as gold, he agreed that the government could buy silver bars. Pittman said that the silver legislative draft was progressing well and could be submitted to the President by the end of the week, causing prices to rise initially and then fall back to 1007 yuan. However, due to the tight foreign exchange market, the market remained stable. Later, banks actively settled their accounts, and the Central Bank vigorously intervened, gradually raising prices by more than ten yuan. The Associated Press reported that the President's support for silver as a reserve caused a setback. The domestic market hardened slightly. Although silver prices in the Seattle night market rose 0.25 and then fell 0.25, there was no significant impact. Later, the gold market fell slightly. The market was stable after opening due to the decline of silver prices in the Seattle night market by 0.125. It was rumored that the silver bill was delayed for discussion. However, Reuters corrected the report that silver prices in the night market in December had increased by 0.125, and prices initially rose and then fell slightly. Later, dealers counter-bargained, and banks were not short of supply. Exchange rates in the UK and US tightened consistently. The Bombay exchange rate fell by eight annas. The Central Bank opened for cash again, causing prices to rise rapidly, breaking through the 20-yuan mark. The Da Mei Evening News reported that the US President said there was no immediate need for silver legislation, and that the meeting with the silver faction would be held tomorrow. In addition, Senator Borah suddenly broke away from the silver faction, indicating signs of internal strife among silver advocates. The closing price was the most bullish. The price of red gold was 1028 yuan. The day's market conditions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 1015 yuan, a rebound of 15 yuan and 30 cents compared to the previous close. Spot prices opened at 14 yuan.

Yingfeng Heng still sold, falling to 1 yuan and 80 cents, but due to the tight foreign exchange market, the Central Bank opened for cash, and it was anticipated that HSBC would lower its exchange rates for British currency by 0.25 and US currency by half a yuan. Large clients such as Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Yifeng, Yongyongdeyuqingyongheng Yu, etc. all entered orders, rising to 6 yuan. Cuitai and Qianchangxiang sold orders, falling back to within 4 yuan. Dadecheng Heng Yu still entered orders, rising to 5 yuan and a half. Fu'an and others sold, falling back to 3 yuan and a half, but because Qianchangxiang, Yuanchangyong, Dadecheng, and Fuchang received orders, prices fluctuated and rose. The Central Bank continuously opened for cash, and Huabi and Mitsui ate August US dollars at 0.125. Qianchangxiang and Dadecheng Yicheng competed to buy, rising to 8 yuan and 70 cents. Hengxing and Cuitai came to sell, and Dekang suppressed prices, gradually falling back to 4 yuan and a half, but because Yongde, Yingfengheng, Yuanchun, Shenkang, Dadecheng, etc. still had appetite, prices rose again to 7 yuan and 60 cents. Shengda sold orders and gradually fell back, but there were still several struggles. Afterwards, dealers wanted to sell September US dollars at 0.375, but they were difficult to sell. Shengda Yifeng and Yonghengxing sold orders, and sentiment was suppressed, falling to 1 yuan and 80 cents. Qingfa Yongbingxing Zhaofengchang and Fuyu still bought on dips, and then rebounded to 4 yuan and 80 cents. Yongde suddenly had sales, and it was difficult to rise again. Under the fluctuation, spot prices and Fuxingyong all sold, and the midday close fell to 1013 yuan and 60 cents. Spot prices bid at 3 yuan and a half.</p>

Yingfeng Heng Shengda Hongxing sold at 4 yuan. Mitsui bought August US dollars at 0.1875 and then found it difficult to close.

Later, Mitsui bought August US dollars at 0.125. The Bombay exchange rate fell by eight annas. Spot prices Hengxing Fuyi Yuankang Xiang Yongde Chunyuanyong Qingfa Yong and others bought down. The Central Bank opened for cash again, and prices broke through the 20-yuan mark. The market was tight. Although Qianchangxiang and others sold within 19 yuan, because the Da Mei Evening News reported that the President was planning to delay discussion of the silver issue, sentiment was bullish, and dealers vigorously bid for shillings. The domestic market tightened. Qingfa Yong Dadecheng and others entered orders at 22 yuan and a half. Yifeng Yong Qianchangxiang Heng Chang Yong took the opportunity to sell at high prices, fluctuating and falling to 20 yuan, but Yongde and Zhengchang still had appetite, rising again to 2 yuan. At this time, Ruikang sold orders, and there were many struggles. Finally, because Tianfeng Hengxing and Dadecheng competed to buy, the closing price was raised to 1023 yuan and 20 cents. After the close, Chunyuanyong and Shunli and others entered orders, once rising to 4 yuan, but Hongxing supplied from time to time, and fell again to within 3 yuan, and finally remained flat. The highest price for the day was 102 yuan and 20 cents, and the lowest price was 1007 yuan, a fluctuation of 16 yuan and 60 cents. As a result, the closing price rebounded 23 yuan and a half compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 32 yuan and a half because HSBC lowered its exchange rate for US dollars by half a yuan, resulting in a gold price of 1064 yuan, 60 cents and 20 points.

<p>Yesterday, the financial market was extremely prosperous because the Spring Races had ended and all foreign firms had reopened. Transactions from the previous few days were consolidated yesterday, so the market atmosphere was extremely vigorous. Various procedures were also very complicated. However, the interest rate for both foreign and domestic interbank lending was 6% for both the morning and afternoon markets, a decrease of 2% compared to the previous day. Adding water to margins, there were surplus funds and supply exceeded demand, so transactions were always done at flat rates. In terms of draft transactions, transfers and new transactions totaled more than 4.3 million in the morning market and more than 200,000 in the afternoon market. Transactions in the small general association totaled more than 500,000. Bank collections and deliveries were more prosperous than in the previous few days, with foreign banks collecting and delivering more than 3.6 million in drafts, more than 5.8 million in various goods, foreign exchange mortgages, and miscellaneous collections, more than 800,000 in foreign exchange settlements, more than 800,000 in telegraphic transfers, and 600,000 in warehouse entries.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange, despite having had a day's holiday, remained sluggish as before. Although there were rumors circulating, they seemed uncertain and unreliable. Public sentiment was very calm. Both bulls and bears persisted in their stances as before. With such a stagnant and circling market, neither side's strength could be revealed before the settlement deadline approached. However, the general sentiment was that the bulls would likely not gain the upper hand. Even if there were a significant drop in the trend, the rebound would be rapid, and it would still shift with changes in the environment. Yesterday, the overall market trend was circling with fatigue. At the start of the first session, it was slightly firm, but when it reached the 20-yuan mark, there was a large sell-off of the 20th bond, causing the trend to fall. Subsequently, all bids followed, dropping by about two or three jiao. Both the second session and the afternoon opening saw ups and downs, with fluctuations of only about one jiao. However, there were more falls than rises, and the closing price was only down by one or two jiao, but it was a steady decline. The trend was chaotic, public sentiment was idle, and trading was greatly reduced. Major players remained on the sidelines, and speculators also unanimously took a wait-and-see approach. In summary, the market prices fell by one to four jiao. The total trading volume was 8,158,000 yuan. The details of the price fluctuations are listed below for comparison (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>The New Fung Yang Hong reported that yesterday (the 9th), the stock market turned downward. The optimistic interpretation of silver developments in Washington by traders changed, recognizing that no matter what silver policy the government formulates, there would be no possibility of inflation, or if there were, it would be minimal. However, the silver faction always insisted that purchasing silver could raise prices and create an inflationary effect. Although silver stocks and futures fell, large strips rose. Small exchanges also fell, and bond prices varied. U.S. Treasury bonds were low due to profit-taking by bulls. According to agent reports: (Securities) rose first and then fell, but the pressure was still light, and resistance occurred before the close. (Wheat) Bulls slightly took profits, and the drought situation remained unchanged, but since it had risen for many days, the buying side's chips expanded, so it is only suitable to buy when it falls. (Cotton) The reduction in demand for yarn and cloth led the yarn industry to consider the possibility of factories reducing working hours by 25% for a period of 60 to 90 days. The silver plan was chaotic, and people felt quite confused. At the same time, the meaning of inflation was temporarily discounted. The weather was favorable, and traders bought when prices fell. (Rubber) Traders were quite disappointed with the measures announced by the International Rubber Committee in various places and the extension of export restrictions to August 1. Bulls took profits bravely, and the market fell sharply following Singapore and London. It is said that consumers' panic over soaring prices has decreased. (Silver) There was no definite plan announced to the public in Washington, and people were extremely confused. The total turnover for the day was 1,030,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market suddenly reversed and declined, and the falling trend intensified. However, the current yarn sales can still be maintained. The bullish mentality says that North China has bought a lot in recent days, and its appetite is already full. Secondly, factories are very willing to offer existing yarn, so people's hearts suddenly became tired and selling prevailed again. In fact, the competition between British and Japanese cotton industries and our country's cotton industry is becoming increasingly unfavorable.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Yarn Falls by More Than Two Yuan <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the auction yarn market in the morning session, the market sentiment was still good due to the remaining momentum from the previous day. However, in the second and third sessions, there was a lack of buyers, and prices fell by five, seven, eight jiao to one yuan for each month. In the afternoon, it was heard that existing yarn transactions were slightly cleared, and the exchange reduced special certificates for sellers. Also, there was bad news, and the falling trend intensified. Prices fell by one, two, three, four, and five jiao for each month. The total turnover for the day was 41,900 bales. It was found that Da Chang Cheng sold 1,050 bales, Chang Yu 950 bales, Da Ji 1,350 bales, Tong He 600 bales, Chang Feng 1,950 bales, Geng Feng 1,300 bales, Da Feng 700 bales, Yi Da 900 bales, Yuan Da bought 2,500 bales, Geng Feng 1,450 bales, Yong Chang 800 bales, Heng Yi 700 bales, Tong Ji 600 bales, Heng De 800 bales, Yuan Tai 700 bales, and Tai Chang 750 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>The sales of existing yarn are still good. It was found that various firms bought a total of 1,100 bales throughout the day.</p>
<p>The market is average. The purchase amounts of various firms are as follows: Beiping 600, Guangdong 45, Inland 160, Xiamen 5, Same Industry 5, Yunnan 130, Jiangxi 90, Changsha 50, Ningbo 5.</p>
<p>The cotton market is slightly weak, and the falling trend is very strong. After several days of continuous rise, profit-takers closed their positions, and the market trended downward again. However, Japanese merchants gradually sold as prices rose. However, the general followers' idea of short covering has not been dispelled, so the cotton market is more expensive than the yarn market. However, the cotton inventory is weak, so there are few new sellers.</p>

<p>At the opening of the auction cotton market in the morning session, the market lacked buyers due to the fall in U.S. cotton and the shrinking exchange rate. Prices fell by three or four jiao for each month. In the afternoon, prices fell by nearly two jiao for nearby months and five fen to one jiao for distant months. The total turnover for the day was 127,500 dan.

<p>Shaanxi Cotton 42.00, Rihua Factory imported 200 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market lacked major buyers. It fell due to good weather and poor cloth market conditions. As a result, spot prices fell by 15 points, and futures prices fell by 9 to 13 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by 4 points, and futures prices rose by 23 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 2 points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to speculation by speculators, but then fell back due to selling by some European exporters and Japanese merchants. As a result, Pingar rose by 7.5 jiao, Aumra rose by 2 rupees and 7.5 jiao, and Bairoxi rose by 2 rupees and 2.5 jiao. The original telegram is recorded on the left (9th telegram):</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for each month showed a trend of firming first and then weakening. The quoted price of foreign wheat was reported to have risen by three, five jiao to about one yuan the day before yesterday. Yesterday, Chicago went down by half a jiao, so after the opening, people's hearts were once seen as beautiful, but after the second session, the market atmosphere for each month showed weakness again. Because the weather was sunny and the climate was smooth, and Fuxin and Fufeng factories gradually sold off each period, about 100,000 bags, so people's hearts turned to extreme weakness. When the afternoon opened, people's hearts were seen to be depressed again. The opening price for this month was as low as 1 yuan, 9 jiao, 3 fen, and 2.5 li, creating a new lowest record. However, in order to seek temporary peace, the factories were heard to have stopped again, so the market atmosphere stabilized slightly. However, according to the recent situation, it is still difficult to stand up for this kind of small recovery. As a result, this month fell by 7.5 li, June fell by 1 fen and 2.5 li, July, August, and September fell by 1 fen, and October fell by half a fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning and afternoon, the prices for each month generally showed a flat and weak circling trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat had risen by three, five jiao to more than one yuan the day before yesterday. Although it fell back by one jiao yesterday, it still felt like more gains than losses, so the market situation was still stable. However, once the weather turns sunny, the new wheat harvest is approaching day by day, and the foreign wheat ordered by the factories is gradually arriving. In the future, there will be very little room for the wheat market to turn around, so the changes in the market will be known during the harvest period. As a result, July fell by a small amount of 1 fen, and there were no other comparisons. The existing wheat market has already started to open, but only Fuxin still has engagements, and the rest have little movement. Therefore, the market value had to fall greatly. The price of wheat in Taierzhuang was 3 yuan, the price of wheat in Guide was 3 yuan, the secondary price was 2 yuan and 9 jiao, and half a fen, the price of wheat in Dangshan was 3 yuan, the secondary price was 2 yuan and 9 jiao and 7 fen, the price of wheat in Mingguang was 2 yuan and 9 jiao, and the secondary price was 8 jiao and 8 fen, the price of wheat in Yaowan was 2 yuan and 9 jiao and half a fen, and the secondary price was 9 jiao and 2 fen, and the price of wheat in South Suzhou was 2 yuan and 9 jiao and half a fen, and the price of wheat in Hezhou was 2 yuan and 9 jiao and 2 fen, totaling 6,000 bags, which were handled by Fuxin.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, many sources arrived again, a total of more than 40 firms (more than 6,000 stones), with thick japonica rice and late rice each accounting for half. The sales market was also slightly inferior, thinking that the weather had turned sunny, people's hearts were softer, and the market was declining. The North Ocean gang's late rice consumption was very small, and the South Ocean gang also had few, only handling six or seven hundred bags of Sisong Lianzhong and other goods. The market price fell by several fen. Thick japonica rice sources turned numerous. Following that, urban and rural consumption was not strong, so the price of Changbang Suzhou Tong Nanhang and other goods fell by 5 fen each. Fortunately, Duyang Jian's arrival and sales were balanced, which is still a fixed situation. Only Yinbian Yuan continued to be outstanding due to the lack of goods and fragrant consumption.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, nearly ten goods arrived from Hexia inland roads, and more than 100 firms remained in the river. The sales consumption of various colors in the market was ordinary in the white japonica rice market in the morning, and slightly more active in the afternoon. Yangjian, Dujian, Bujian, and Kejian were also ordinary. Baiwu zero consumption was still strong, and early thin rice was still good. The white japonica rice market was weak by a small number of fen in the morning market, and turned stable in the afternoon market. Yangjian, Dujian, Bujian, Kejian, and Baiyuan early thin rice were all stable.</p>

<p>Sultry Sudden Cold Thunderstorm Silkworm Ants All Start to Change</p>
<p>(Haining Discovers Silkworm Measles) Farmers in urban and rural areas, the local silkworms hatched early this year have suffered damage due to the cold and rainy weather. Improved species were bred to supplement them, but the silkworm ants in the early sleep still show little change due to the long period of rainy days. They began to eat leaves during the first sleep, but their development is still unsound. Now, the early batch has had its major sleep, and the late batch only ate leaves during the third sleep. Unexpectedly, in recent days, it started with hot and sultry weather, followed by sudden cold and thunderstorms, resulting in early silkworms spitting yellow pus, excreting black water, and smelling strangely after death. The loss of local silkworms is heavier, almost completely abandoned.</p>
<p>(Many Silkworms Rot and Die in Xinchang) In the Huangze area of Xinchang, many people raise improved silkworms, and many also breed local species. Due to continuous rain and cold weather, most of the local silkworms died stiffly in the second and third sleeps. The improved species also began to stagnate, losing their sleep. In the past two days, it was extremely hot and cold. The temperature differed by 30 to 40 degrees in two days, and there were also heavy thunderstorms, resulting in early silkworms in the third sleep all developing silkworm plague. Most of the local silkworms rotted and died. The infection was very rapid. Although isolation was added, the loss of silkworm ants was 30% to 40% per day.</p>
<p>(Danyang Young Silkworms Lose Sleep) Due to the cold weather in the four rural areas, the mulberry trees sprouted late, and the silkworm spread was later than usual. The ants were unevenly released. Although the improved species were fed with fresh mulberry during the first sleep, they showed little change despite the bad weather. The early batch had already completed two sleeps and was fully grown, and the late batch had also started eating leaves. In the past two days, it suddenly became hot and sultry. The next day, it was suddenly cold, and it rained like a pillar, causing the early silkworm ants to lie stiff and unable to get up, wandering in the curtain, and acting clumsily. The late batch had a sharp decrease in appetite, and the current situation is not good.</p>
<h3 id="e261">The Situation After the New Tea Market Opened <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Since the new red and green teas in Wenzhou opened one after another, yesterday, the Xielong Hehe Jinlong Huacha and other firms were still quite interested in the above-mentioned red and green teas. However, because the selling price was lower than the old one, the cost of Huacha merchants' incoming goods was huge, and negotiations mostly failed to reach an agreement, so transactions were not very active. As for the new green tea in Tuzhuang, yesterday, the store owners released new styles of Zhenmei with digital values again. According to unofficial news from the market, Suian goods were opened at 102 yuan, and Zhuji goods were opened at 90 yuan. Observing this market, the prices were lower than in previous years, so general tea merchants adopted a tight attitude towards the price recognition of various kinds of raw tea.</p>

<p>Corrugated iron transactions are good. The construction firms have a large appetite, and the customer firms also need to handle it from time to time. In three or four days, a total of five or six hundred bundles were traded. The market goods were reported to be in short supply due to the small number of sources, and the standard ones went straight up. For example, No. 24 was estimated at 12 yuan and 4 jiao per market dan, No. 26 was 13 yuan and 5 jiao, and No. 28 was 14 yuan, which was said to have risen by a jiao from the previous market.</p>

<p>Medium-thick serge is in severe short supply in the market, and the trend is particularly popular. The selling price is very firm and rising. The Western clothing industry has an inquiry. Tianyou No. 1000 and No. 2000 have been sold at 5 yuan and 4 jiao, Dongfang 3008 at 5 yuan and 2 jiao, and Ningfeng Ruyi Yuan at 4 yuan and 8 jiao. It is not easy for those who want to wholesale to obtain them.</p>
<p>Double-yarn tarpaulin, double-sided yarn thick raincoat cloth, the stocks in Shendi's internal and external warehouses have been sold out one after another. The prices of ordinary brands have jumped from 3 yuan and 1 jiao to 3 yuan and 5 jiao. Yuanchang's two-color goods are out of stock, and buyers are waiting to use them, so they all changed to handling domestic goods. Domestic goods with a width of 28 inches sell for 1 yuan and 4 jiao and a half per yard, and No. 2 sells for 1 yuan and 2 jiao and a half.</p>

<p>— Xiao Long</p>
<p>(4) The Lamb on the Altar</p>
<p>If I were to name the biggest liars in the world, I would definitely say it's doctors. Doctors never tell patients the truth. When a patient is about to die, the doctor will still say to him: "Don't worry, you'll get better soon." They keep deceiving the patient until their last breath. Similarly, that doctor with a Hitler-like mustache also used the same trick on me. After a nurse covered my body with a thick quilt, the doctor took a syringe filled with anesthetic and said to me, "This is the greatest pain you will ever feel. After this, you won't feel any more pain." As he spoke, he inserted the needle into my throat to administer local anesthesia. I knew that the pain of the injection was limited, so I endured it contentedly, letting him inject both sides of my throat six times.</p>
<p>My throat gradually felt a little numb. After a while, several nurses prepared all the instruments, and the doctor first inserted those terrifying instruments into my throat.</p>
<p>I immediately realized that everything he had told me was a lie.</p>
<p>I struggled, but my hands and feet were restrained, completely like a lamb being slaughtered on the altar.</p>
<p>I saw blood splashing from my throat, splattering on the hands of the nurses and the doctor, on the quilt, and on the wall. I vaguely saw those terrifying instruments being exchanged among the doctor and several nurses under the light. The effectiveness of the anesthetic injection seemed minimal to me at that time because I still felt a lot of pain. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't because many things were blocking my mouth.</p>
<p>Although the doctor's speed of the surgery was commendable, said to be less than two minutes in total, it felt like two centuries had passed to me until the doctor took out the last forceps and said, "Okay!" only then did I feel like I had been released from the greatest torture.</p>
<p>At that time, if I had the right to kill someone, I think I would definitely raise a knife without hesitation and chop down on the doctor's head. Even though he patted my shoulder and said with a smile, "The surgery went very smoothly because you were able to handle it very well."</p>
<p>My nasal passages were full of blood, and my throat felt swollen. Breathing seemed to be blocked. Although the doctor kept telling me to open my mouth and breathe, I still felt suffocated and unable to breathe. I felt like I was about to die. I felt like I had completely experienced the sensation of being hanged before being strangled, and the pain of those dying people whose tracheas were clogged with phlegm.</p>
<p>It is said that people who commit suicide will definitely regret it in the moment before death. Unfortunately, regret is too late, and the result is only death. Therefore, I now think that if there is anyone who wants to commit suicide, in order to avoid irreparable regret, it is best to ask the doctor to operate on the tonsils first, to taste that kind of experience close to death. Fortunately, this is not real death, and there is no fear of regret. This will definitely stop him on the brink, turn back, and struggle harder on the road of life.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Being Earnest <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Kemu</p>
<p>Egyptian culture has long been buried, and the pyramids stand alone. Standing in the middle of the desert, it makes people think of the grand and majestic past. Why were the pyramids built? It is because the ancient Egyptians were "earnest."</p>
<p>But the Chinese have a different attitude towards life, "The theater is a small world, and the world is a big theater." Everyone thinks of themselves as playing roles on stage, intentionally or unintentionally. Since they are acting in a play, of course, there is no such thing as being earnest. Everyone is just pretending, and it's all muddled. Isn't the horizontal scroll of the famous scholar Zheng Banqiao hanging everywhere? The text says: "It's rare to be muddled."</p>
<p>However, if being muddled is not innate but needs to be pretended, it also requires being earnest. Although Zheng Banqiao seems to be cynical, he is very earnest at heart. Otherwise, his paintings and calligraphy would never have such profound attainments. And what his art expresses is not muddled at all. In modern times, there are many disasters, and right and wrong arise. People's spirits are attacked everywhere. Because they are oppressed, they can only become decadent and not earnest.</p>
<p>It seems that only Buddhism advocates emptiness and silence, but the principle of Dependent Origination of the Mahayana is against those who take the appearance of emptiness and become greedy. Various faults arise in the ultimate emptiness, and it cannot be interpreted as being unearnest or a talisman for laziness. Just look at the hard work of many Buddhists, and you will know that their purpose is not to act in a play. The Five Hegemons and Seven Heroes are clowns, and it is true that only Sakyamuni, Jesus, and the Chinese Laozi, Zhuangzi, Shenzi, and Hanzi can play the role of clowns, but it is still a bit unsuitable.</p>
<p>How can the spirit of us Chinese be unearnest? Doctors do not forgive germs when diagnosing diseases, so that patients retain some diseases in their bodies. Political factions also do not show any mercy when attacking dissidents, only short of "whipping the grave". Small vendors who are arguing over the tip of an awl are more shrewd than Western accountants when it comes to being clear about every cent. Only national affairs are difficult to muddle through. With a strong enemy in front of us, we are not allowed to be earnest, so we have to give up. There are several ways to say that you are not earnest. One is to say to the oppressor that if you are beaten and unable to fight back, please don't be earnest. This is a cry for mercy. Although it is a failure, there is a chance of survival. One is to say to yourself that you have become a complete muddled insect and will never be cured. One is to say to the person you have defeated that it is a kind of anesthetic to make people feel at ease as slaves. Besides, many people are acting in a play, using counterfeit money, or specializing in the empty city trick, and they can't be earnest.</p>
<p>Perhaps an earnest life has too much suffering, but only this is the way to survive. The pyramids were not built casually.</p>
<h3 id="e266">New Shoal of Zigui <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Mengte</p>
<p>Zigui County, formerly known as Guizhou, is located west of Yichang, only a hundred or so *li* by water, and there are steamers going up and down every day. Outsiders would surely think that the county's transportation is very convenient.</p>
<p>But that's not the case. Steamers going up to Sichuan and down to Yichang rarely stop in this county. This is because the area is right within the so-called Three Gorges, with high mountains, narrow gorges, steep river currents, and even more treacherous shoals.</p>
<p>During this season of low winter water, even the steamers with full horsepower that specialize in navigating the Sichuan River have to spend hundreds of dollars, hiring the local boat trackers of the shoal to shout, pull, and haul with all their might when passing the famous "New Shoal" of this county.</p>
<p>The New Shoal is probably named after a "Discharge Shoal" (洩灘) twenty *li* upstream to the west. Like other shoals, the New Shoal was formed naturally by the collapse of high mountains. In these months of low water, the rocks on the river surface jut out menacingly, causing the river flow to form a steep cliff more than ten feet high. All steamers going west must first throw the iron cable onto the south bank, have thousands of people pull on it, and then use the machinery at the front to winch it up. So,</p>
<p>"Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave! Heave! Heave!"</p>
<p>The number of people pulling the boat is countless! They climb up the rocks and jump down again; they crowd together and then disperse; there are men and women, very old men and very young children. Although the weather is very cold, many young men still wear only a torn blue jacket. Set off by the gray-white beach, they sometimes look like individual or rows of distant trees.</p>
<p>"Heave! Heave-ho! Heave!"</p>
<p>Their voices are very loud, harmonious, and rhythmic, sometimes a sound is prolonged for a long time, and sometimes a tone is repeated very quickly and urgently! Heave! Heave! Heave.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this great and beautiful sound is always hindered by its environment and cannot be transmitted far to the world. The echo returning from the valley seems as if someone is imitating it in a very, very distant place! But it is very weak.</p>
<p>There are about two to three hundred households on both sides of the New Shoal. Most of them rely on this shoal for a living. Straw mat sheds extend from halfway up the mountain all the way to the riverbank. But it has not formed even a small street market; they live very freely and scattered. In addition to selling tea and wine, the most common commodity is opium.</p>
<p>These boat trackers spend all day in these straw huts, sitting on a kind of long bench, hugging their knees with their hands, looking into the distance, and listening to the roar of the shoal water.</p>
<p>In addition to pulling steamers, they also pull wooden boats loaded with local merchants' goods up the shoal or contract to guide these wooden boats down the shoal. These people's lives change very little. In the winter, they rely entirely on this business to make a living. They know in advance what time each day which boat will pass. When the boat arrives, men, women, old and young all participate:</p>
<p>"Heave-ho! Heave—ho!"</p>
<p>It is said that as long as you participate, whether you pull or not, you will still get a few copper coins.</p>
<p>To the east of the New Shoal, there is a mountain said to have been chained in the back with iron chains, hence the name "Locked Mountain" (鎖住山). The stone peaks on both sides collapse into the heart of the river. If one day it collapses like the old mountain above the New Shoal, it would be extremely beneficial for these people. So they often say:</p>
<p>"For Zigui to prosper, unless 'Locked Mountain' collapses."</p>
<p>They are constantly hoping for a newer New Shoal to appear in Zigui.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Rouge Water <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Wei</p>
<p>In the dining hall of a hotel in Paris, twenty or so Chinese men and women are sitting around an oval table, enjoying a fine dinner; it is an engagement banquet.</p>
<p>Zhi Mu, because of his young age and close friendship with the host, was placed at the very end of the table. He wasn't feeling well that evening and didn't want to attend the banquet in the first place. But he couldn't resist the host's repeated phone calls and finally attended.</p>
<p>Miss Duan happened to be sitting to his right, a slightly plump nineteen-year-old girl who spoke Beijing dialect with a pleasant accent. In many social settings, she had trained her demeanor to be neither dissolute nor shy. The unique beauty of a young girl was fully expressed by her embellishments. She had only been in France for four months, and she had already become the center of pursuit for some men. There were two at the table: they admired Miss Duan but were afraid to approach her; now they were shooting jealous glances from the other end of the oval table, expressing unnamed resentment at Zhi Mu's proximity to Miss Duan.</p>
<p>The hosts and guests were all talking and laughing excitedly. The twenty or so men and women unconsciously divided into several small groups, each with a focus of discussion. Miss Duan had always been talkative, and Miss Yu, Mrs. Hong, and Mr. Lu nearby could also contribute to the fun, but Zhi Mu had hardly spoken. He drank and ate silently, not feeling the need to make any superfluous remarks. This made the guests next to him feel strangely annoyed and out of place.</p>
<p>Zhi Mu's silence particularly aroused Miss Duan's aversion. She thought: I have never met such a clumsy and indifferent young man who is not even ugly! He not only doesn't know how to show the minimum politeness to his neighbor, but he doesn't even give half a smile to the female guest beside him. He's probably newly arrived in France. But judging from his well-tailored evening dress and his skillful use of knives and forks, it seems that he has lived in France for a long time. In short, it's simply unfortunate to sit with such a young man! "Let me teach him a lesson." Miss Duan raised her eyebrows and smiled slightly.</p>
<p>So she sent a suggestive glance to Miss Yu, Mrs. Hong, and Mr. Lu, and then quietly pursed her red lips towards Zhi Mu, and they all nodded in tacit agreement. Zhi Mu didn't see it at all. He only occasionally noticed Miss Duan picking up her handbag placed on her lap, taking out a small mirror, and naturally applying some rouge to her thin lips.</p>
<p>Halfway through the banquet, the guests began to toast the newly engaged hosts and unanimously asked the hosts to drink a crossed-arms cup of wine. After a burst of laughter, it was the guests' turn to toast each other.</p>
<p>"Mr. Su, would you like to have a drink with me?" Miss Duan said to Zhi Mu with a charming smile.</p>
<p>"That would be an honor," Zhi Mu replied calmly.</p>
<p>"Mr. Su, this full glass of red wine, I haven't even touched it yet, so please drink it. Please forgive me for only drinking half a glass of white wine to accompany you."</p>
<p>"Thank you," Zhi Mu raised the glass that Miss Duan gently pushed over, poured the liquid inside completely into his mouth, and swallowed it in one breath without thinking.</p>
<p>Immediately he realized that the liquid was not red wine at all, and it didn't have that sour and sweet taste! He frowned and analyzed it in a hurry, and then determined that the liquid was just a glass of mineral water, and further examination of the outside of the glass clearly showed rouge washed off from Miss Duan's lips. Zhi Mu cursed Miss Duan inwardly: "So it turns out that she applied rouge several times just now, the purpose was to prepare to wash it in mineral water, posing as red wine, to fool me." His face flushed. He smiled bitterly at Miss Yu, Mrs. Hong, and Mr. Lu, who were trying to suppress their laughter. He had been tricked by this cunning girl!</p>
<p>"Thank you," Miss Duan also drank half a glass of white wine at the same time. She looked at the empty glass in front of Zhi Mu and smiled softly. Zhi Mu turned his head away in resentment, sizing up this mischievous Miss Duan. She was talking to Mrs. Jin on her right, only giving him a profile to admire. His eyes quickly followed her forehead, over her nose and mouth, to her neck. The very beautiful curve made him exhale a long breath of satisfaction. Then he greedily looked down from her chest all the way to her thighs.</p>
<p>"Let me hold your plump body for one night to compensate for the exquisite naughtiness of this glass of rouge water!" He turned his head back and sat upright. He no longer stared at Miss Duan, so that others would not know his thoughts.</p>
<p>After champagne was poured into the funnel-shaped glasses in front of everyone, everyone raised their glasses, thanked the hosts, and wished each other health and happiness. Some drank it all in one breath, while others only tasted it and put the glass down. The banquet was considered over. The hosts and guests stood up in unison, left the table, and sat around several coffee tables, drinking another small glass of strong sweet wine or brandy. At the same time, the waiters also served coffee. (To be continued)</p>

<p>When the sun sets below the horizon, the rosy clouds in the blue sky have all faded away.</p>
<p>The frogs in the garden begin to croak restlessly,</p>
<p>Heavy shadows rush through the woods like charging cattle,</p>
<p>The drowsy streetlights flicker dimly.</p>
<p>Wandering alone in the long and empty corridor, lost in thought,</p>
<p>Suddenly, the mournful cry of an owl rises,</p>
<p>Is it like a widow's lament?</p>
<p>Melancholy, sorrow, and fear completely envelop my body.</p>

<p>— Tang Xiru</p>
<p>Afa didn't dare to hope he would win, but he desperately wanted to. Two mice were jumping in his temples, he was covered in sweat, his eyes were blurred, he couldn't see what was written on the blackboard, and the heads of the people in front were constantly rising and falling. "Only one character 'wealth' (財) is right," someone squeezed out, saying disappointedly. Afa's heart lit up. But it immediately darkened again. What's the use of getting one or two characters right? It's even more unpleasant than not getting any right at all!</p>
<p>The people inside the shop squeezed out, and the people outside squeezed in. The eyes of those squeezing in were all eager, and the faces of those squeezing out were all ashen.</p>
<p>It was Afa's turn. Layer by layer, he had squeezed from the last row to the second row. He looked up! What! He almost shouted out. All the blood, flesh, and bones in his body danced and sang. Slow down! Could it be that he was dreaming? Could the words written on the blackboard be those characters that he knew so well that he almost didn't recognize them today? He rubbed his eyes, rubbed them again, until tears came out. Could these be the characters he had circled? Was he having a fever, or was it real? He was so anxious he wanted to cry! He was so happy he wanted to cry! He touched his forehead, and large beads of sweat were seeping out. Ah! Are the characters written on the blackboard really those characters? Can you guarantee that in a few minutes they won't transform like the Guangzhou lottery tickets and be worth nothing? Could these characters really be the ones he circled? They stood there, all so majestic, like old friends who had suddenly become officials, and he was a little afraid to go forward and recognize them! He wanted everyone to tell him, and to tell him loudly, that he was not dreaming or having a fever! It was all real! He had won with these characters! His two cents had really turned into tens of thousands of dollars! And those tens of thousands of dollars were all his!</p>
<p>He seemed dazed, and asked: (The words were almost stuck in his throat, and he couldn't force them out) "Excuse me, excuse me, what characters won?" As he said this, he touched the middle-aged man wearing glasses standing in front of him. "Big, wealth, money, four, ten thousand, more, gold!"</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>The man with glasses seemed insulted and turned his head to look at another blackboard.</p>
<p>"Is it a two-cent ticket?"</p>
<p>"Is it from the previous two days?"</p>
<p>"If you win with a two-cent ticket, will you really get more than forty thousand dollars?"</p>
<p>He still wanted to ask, he still wanted to ask many questions. This matter was too bizarre, too complicated, too absurd, more unbelievable than a dream. No, he wouldn't be at peace until he had the money in his hands and didn't ask any more questions.</p>
<p>It was true that he had won. Many people confirmed that the characters on the blackboard were no different from the characters he had circled. But the money would be available tomorrow morning. They had to wait for the remittance from the Macau headquarters, which was the usual practice.</p>
<p>He squeezed out of the pile of envious eyes. His head was held very high: "I'm a rich man! I'm a rich man!" He took one step and recited one sentence, and laughed after each sentence.</p>

<p>Brief Remarks</p>
<h3 id="e270">County Magistrate Punished with Hard Labor <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Mingtang</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: An, the County Magistrate of Dong'a County, because he abused public funds while in office and put them all in his private pockets, was sued by the people to the province. After a military court investigation confirmed the facts, he was sentenced by Chairman Han Fuqu of Shandong Province to a fine equal to twice the amount of the embezzled funds and to hard labor, carrying earth to repair the Dongmen city wall road as a warning to corrupt officials. This can be said to be a very interesting matter. Chairman Han Fuqu of Shandong Province has been in office for several years, and his actions are often surprising. For example, he previously personally tried a case of passion killing, and now he has sentenced the county magistrate to hard labor, carrying earth to repair the road on the city wall. There are several other similar matters, but unfortunately, I can't remember them all. In short, they are all very special. Although this is not within the law, given the ineffectiveness of today's laws and the prevalence of corruption, doing these very special things outside the law can be said to be satisfying. As mentioned earlier, County Magistrate An of Dong'a County abused public funds while in office, which under normal circumstances would not be considered a complete matter. Even if the people sued to the province, wouldn't it just end with "there is a cause for the matter, but no evidence has been found"? However, Han Fuqu gave him "hard labor," which is meaningful. Punishing the county magistrate with hard labor is to completely expose the county magistrate's crimes to the people. I think that when the county magistrate is doing hard labor, many people will definitely stare at him; and under the public gaze, the county magistrate will definitely be ashamed beyond measure.</p>
<p>However, to return to the question, is it effective to punish corruption by simply punishing one or two county magistrates with hard labor? This is somewhat questionable. Because, as we know, corruption is produced by a certain society. A certain social organization then produces a certain social situation. And the current society is fundamentally a corrupt society. In such a society, how can one find people who are not corrupt? Therefore, this is not a question of whether a part of the officials are corrupt, but rather that this society fundamentally cannot produce incorruptible officials. Han Fuqu's method of punishing county magistrates with hard labor is like killing a dog to warn the monkeys, but will the majority of corrupt officials be able to learn from the past after Chairman Han's "killing"? This is the first question we must raise.</p>
<p>Of course, Han Fuqu's punishment of a certain county magistrate was only an occasional measure, and he did not say that corruption could necessarily be eradicated by this. Therefore, to a certain extent, we may as well agree with his action. However, we must not forget that this is only an occasional event, and at most it is only pleasing to the people. It is not necessarily effective in eradicating corruption. The real eradication of corruption can only be achieved in the course of our overthrowing the old society, transforming the new society, and the practice of the masses. Only when the masses truly overthrow the old society and transform the new society can corruption be completely defeated and eradicated. This is the point that we should recognize today.</p>
<h3 id="e271">A Trip to the Fan Ancestral Hall in Tianping <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Zhao</p>
<p>In the past, there was a famous scholar from Shanxi who, because he loved the scenery of Suzhou, abandoned his original home in Shanxi and called himself a Suzhou person. What is it about Suzhou that makes people change their affections like this? Indeed, Suzhou has many things that can make people linger! However, I especially love her waters: whether it is the spring water with gentle waves or the autumn water with a desolate air, they are both lovable. They are really as interesting as her girls! The waters of Suzhou.</p>
<p>The late spring weather is completely immersed in a gentle atmosphere. Quietly driving a small boat, from the city to Tianping Mountain. Although there is a long journey of thirty *li*, it will not make people feel the slightest bit lonely, the scenery along the way is enough to amuse you; remember, the one paddling the oars is still a Wu girl! I put my bare feet in the water and let them soak, making a gurgling sound; I couldn't help but hum Wu Meicun's poem: "In front of the door is a stretch of Hengtang water, the oars of Hengtang fly away like a bird." If this doesn't describe the waters of Suzhou, what else does? I don't want my name to be left forever in the world, I just want to be a small fish in the river here.</p>
<p>Setting off to Tianping in the morning, you can reach it in three hours. The mountain is not very high, but it is so charming and moving! I thought of Dai Chunshi's famous line, "Spring mountains are like beauties." Spring mountains are really beautiful! Because the mountain is quiet, the chirping of birds seems even more secluded and pleasant to the ear; the birds probably have added the atmosphere of the Six Dynasties! Otherwise, why haven't I heard it in other places.</p>
<p>I came to Tianping to visit the ancestral hall of Fan Wenzheng Gong (范文正公); however, the Fan Ancestral Hall, famous for thousands of years, has long been reduced to overgrown weeds! I pushed aside many vines to find the ancestral hall gate, but it was deeply locked, forcing me to turn to a side path and pay homage to the statue of Wenzheng Gong in the three dilapidated houses. The dust was so thick, the clay sculpture had faded a layer of color, and everything looked desolate and pitiful. Our great man of a generation! You made a good Yitian Ji (義田記), but what about your descendants now? I heard from the elders in the village that the descendants of the Fan family are still virtuous, and there are many wealthy people in the city, but everyone</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>is unwilling to donate money, allowing the famous historical sites to continue to decay like this, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Deep in the bamboo forest, ancient trees soar into the sky, surrounded by short walls. Inside is the tomb of Wenzheng Gong, surrounded by mountains on three sides, and facing the magnificent peaks of Wanhuchao Tian (萬笏朝天) in front, a magnificent sight. It is said that this is the tomb of Wenzheng Gong's clothes and hat. There is clear spring water here, I scooped some with my hands and drank it, and it was indeed cool and refreshing, probably because I had been walking for a long time and was thirsty! I thought:</p>
<p>To the east of the tomb is Gaoyizhuang (高義莊), built at the foot of Tianping Mountain, with the imperial inscription of Emperor Gaozong of the Qing Dynasty enshrined in the main hall. Perhaps because of the imperial inscription, the Zhuang is better repaired than the ancestral hall, probably for this reason.</p>
<p>Further past is the Yushuting (御書亭), which is said to be where Emperor Gaozong of the Qing Dynasty stayed during his southern tour. There are two poems made by the emperor, and the local people regard them as sacred and specially built a pavilion to enshrine them, but now it has also been abandoned! Leaving only people to reminisce.</p>
<p>The passing of time forced me to return. I really didn't want to leave here! I would rather stay in the mountains for the rest of my life and not return to the polluted city. But after all, I had to return. I lay on the clean stern of the boat, watching the flying returning clouds, completing my journey in the hazy twilight.</p>
<h3 id="e272">How to Avoid Being Pessimistic in Life <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Ben</p>
<p>Living in this era of the century, generally speaking, everyone has some three parts boredom, five parts pain. The ultimate in boredom and pain is to make people discouraged and pessimistic. This is an inevitable kind of era disease, which is indeed annoying to talk about.</p>
<p>Look; in this large group of colleagues, who can escape this trap.</p>
<p>Old Zhang frowns all day long, and always talks about "no hope." Originally, he was only in his twenties, a young and vigorous man, but he looks depressed and has no vitality at all. When he hears people talk about world affairs, he will scold like a village woman, as if the world is bad to the core, and there is nothing to praise or linger over. It is said that the reason why he is so pessimistic is that he was once tossed about in the political vortex, and his base colleagues sold out the interests of the public. So he resolutely withdrew, and then he took a pessimistic view of everything, and his attitude suddenly became negative.</p>
<p>Old Xiao seems like he is about to cry when he talks about women. Although he is not as completely disappointed as Old Zhang in other things, he always expresses full pessimism. It is said that he has been fooled by women, and he has also played with women. From this, he understood why women are women, and felt that they are really hateful things. So he was extremely disappointed in them, and also fundamentally pessimistic about life.</p>
<p>Although Old Wen is relatively better, he has recently joined them and become pessimistic as well. Whenever the topic of salary comes up, he pouts, and even scolds the accountant's mother. Twenty days have passed in April, and there is no news about the March salary. In the future, it will definitely be worthless, completely donated, purely voluntary work. What kind of world is this? So Old Wen gets particularly upset when he talks about these things, and there is a reason for it.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, who among the large group of colleagues is not like this? When they meet, they are always like enemies, and it is difficult to see a smile on some faces. Even if there is, it always disappears quickly.</p>
<p>Extending this, among the 400 million compatriots, who is not like this except for a small number of the "successful class," especially the young people.</p>
<p>This is not a good phenomenon, and we must find a way to cheer up.</p>
<p>So, how can we avoid being pessimistic? What kind of power should we use to eliminate the entanglement of pessimism? According to my thinking, if we can follow the following methods, we will definitely obtain considerable effectiveness.</p>
<p>First, what I want to propose is that we should have a clear understanding, whether it is of life or of society, we must see clearly that we are human beings, and human beings have a special mission, which is to be active in our view of life, take on our responsibilities, and be determined to do something beneficial for society. We must know that once we fall into pessimism, we will not be able to accomplish anything at all, and we will fundamentally undermine the meaning of life, and just live a muddled life.</p>
<p>Second, I feel that what should be proposed is that we should take personal gains and losses lightly and on a small scale. If a love affair fails, why is it worth worrying about so much? If we have been tortured in politics, we should seize the route of improvement. In short, we should see that there are always places in the world that are more worthy of praise than love, and politics will never always be a black mess.</p>
<p>Third, what I want to propose is that our daily life should be rigorous and disciplined. In other words, we should live in extremely tense "busyness," studying hard, writing hard, and working hard, then boredom and pain will never climb into our hearts. In fact, the reason why many people call themselves "bored" is purely because they are "idle" and have nothing to do, so the seeds of boredom attack their hearts, making it impossible for you not to be pessimistic.</p>
<p>I wrote a muddled piece, and I feel that it is based on experience. I often encourage myself with this, and I am even more willing to encourage my friends who have fallen into the path of pessimism.</p>
<h3 id="e273">A Certain Mansion <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Rose</p>
<p>Just as dawn broke, a black Studebaker sped through the morning air. Vegetable vendors were already carrying their loads to the early market, and the Madam had just returned from playing mahjong all night at a certain mansion. Wang Ma hurried to welcome the Madam inside, and the Madam began to chatter endlessly about her mahjong experience of the night. Whether triumphant or frustrated, she would excitedly speak loudly, until the Fourth Young Master, deep in sleep, was startled awake by the noisy sounds. He demanded that Chun Xiang help him get dressed. The Master also feigned a cough on his opium couch. Realizing it was still time for others to sleep, she quietly lay down on her own opium couch and began to smoke.</p>
<p>The Fourth Young Master, dressed, entered the room. He remembered that the teacher had instructed him yesterday to bring half a dollar for the aviation donation. He asked the Madam, but she had just lost money, and the mention of aviation donation gave her a headache: "What aviation donation, it's all a bunch of deceitful nonsense. I spent a hundred dollars on the last aviation lottery, and didn't even win anything. Ignore them. Tell the teacher that your mother said we're not donating."</p>
<p>The child was rebuffed and, fearing the teacher's scolding, started to cry, "The teacher said we have to donate; everyone else is donating, some even one or two dollars."</p>
<p>"I said we're not donating – not a single penny."</p>
<p>The child continued to cry, annoying the Madam, who scolded him to no avail. Finally, she took out a small two-dime bill from her wallet: "Take it, and tell the teacher we're poor and can only donate two dimes."</p>
<p>The child took the money, still crying.</p>
<p>The Eldest Young Master and his wife had been dancing all night, only returning home at half past three in the morning to sleep. At this moment, they were awakened by the Madam's noisy return, followed by the Fourth Young Master's crying. The Eldest Young Master flew into a rage, shouting and cursing from upstairs. The Eldest Young Mistress, finding it unbearable, quickly ordered Lotus to take the two colorful paper hats brought back from the dance hall to the Fourth Young Master, telling her to quickly coax him and send him off to school.</p>
<p>Lotus came in and said many nice things. The Fourth Young Master finally forgot about the five-dime aviation donation, put on the paper hat, demanded several kisses from Lotus, and happily jumped into the car.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the door, he ran into two unfamiliar men in Western suits driving a brightly shining limousine, sending the Fourth Concubine and Miss Wang home. The Fourth Concubine took a box of chocolates out of her coat pocket and put it in the Fourth Young Master's hand, then she and the Third Young Mistress slipped stealthily into their own rooms.</p>
<p>At school, the Fourth Young Master still wore the paper hat, giving the other one to his best friend, and sharing the chocolates with his classmates. He explained to them that his older brother often took his sister-in-law to dance halls, and these hats were given to them there. Sometimes the dance halls also gave dancers all kinds of interesting toys, and his brother had even taken him to play there once, where he had seen many beautiful women. The children were all envious.</p>
<p>After school, upon returning home, the Madam was again preparing to go out to play mahjong, and the Fourth Young Master tugged at her sleeve, wanting to go with her. After some arguing, the Madam, without options, took out a dollar from her wallet and put it in his hand, telling him to take Lotus to the movies.</p>
<p>So the child stopped making a fuss, and Lotus quietly returned to her room to doll herself up; they rode in the Madam's car together to the movie theater.</p>

<p>— Jian</p>
<p>Dear XX,</p>
<p>I read your letter again at dusk yesterday. It was another debt-collecting letter! Why are you so relentless? I told you before that my love for Shuangmei arose from ordinary circumstances: first acquaintance, then friendship, and eventually love. It was all very normal, nothing special to tell. Yet you insist on a detailed account, as if you wouldn't be satisfied until you knew every detail.</p>
<p>Why are you so unsatisfied? I ask you—</p>
<p>Alright, if you insist on knowing, then I will tell you.</p>
<p>In a mild autumn, I was strolling along the S River. At that time, my mood was like yours, every action filled with a dream of love. I was hoping to meet a woman on this journey, and that this woman would be the one I had been waiting for and would have a love affair with me. Naturally, someone traveling with such expectations is in a dangerous position, because his loneliness makes him prone to a longing for love.</p>
<p>After a long wait, it finally arrived. One day, it was a misty morning, I think, I was at a bus station, waiting for my travel companion to visit Mount W. My luggage was simple: just a blanket and a briefcase.</p>
<p>The morning breeze carried a hint of chill, and I leaned against the entrance of the bus station, lost in my thoughts. What kind of travel companion would I meet on the bus? Would the person I was waiting for be on this trip, or on the second, or the third? A vague sadness weighed slightly on my heart.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I heard footsteps outside – the sound of a woman's leather shoes. I quickly looked up. Ah, the person I was waiting for had arrived – a woman with a graceful figure and charming appearance.</p>
<p>As soon as she entered the station, she asked if there were any buses. I felt that this was a blessing, so I eagerly stepped forward and said to her, "Are you also going to Mount W, Madam? How about we travel together?"</p>
<p>"Oh, are you also going to Mount W, Sir? Then, then that would be great."</p>
<p>Since the bus wouldn't depart with only one passenger, my suggestion was exactly what she wanted.</p>
<p>So we took the bus to Mount W together. The bumpy mountain road gave us plenty of time to talk. That's how we got acquainted.</p>
<p>When the bus reached XX Cave, we had to take a sedan chair to continue. This gave me a chance to offer my services. So I hired a sedan chair for her and took care of her luggage. Then the two of us went up the mountain together.</p>
<p>On the bus, I learned that she was a graduate of a normal school and had worked in the social sector for several years. She was visiting Mount W to see her sick sister. However, from her gentle demeanor, one could not detect any sign of a primary school teacher, and her conversation was nothing like that of a rigid normal school student.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but the moment I saw her, I loved her, and I immediately knew that she was the person I had been waiting for, that she was the lover Heaven had destined for me.</p>

<p>The same lesson taught by two different teachers can result in one enlivening the entire classroom while the other may only manage to induce sleep with their voice – this is something we often see in school. The primary reason for a teacher's success or failure should be attributed to their ability to speak well. Not only teachers, but anyone's success or failure is closely related to their ability to speak. This may seem like a miracle, but one can rise to high office and gain great wealth and power over the masses with their silver tongue. We need not look to far-off figures like Su Qin and Zhang Yi from the Warring States period who exchanged eloquent speech for high positions, but consider the famous figures on the political stage in Europe and America. How many of them were unable to win the support of their people through eloquent words? Speech is necessary in all aspects and deserves our attention.</p>
<p>Webster, the creator of the great dictionary, was a master conversationalist. His words could increase one's courage. "I would rather recognize Han Jingzhou than be enfeoffed as a marquis of ten thousand households." Han Jingzhou must have been an engaging conversationalist who left a good impression. Or, "Fall in love at first sight" – seeing your face and hearing your conversation can often have such wonderful results.</p>
<p>Good conversation is not merely a "game of language"; it often has practical effects. Conversation, to be more precise, should be a form of "careful observation," with a serious meaning.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>, not containing any sense of play. Without looking at your , merely through the attitude you take, and the you adopt in conversation, one can easily determine the kind of person you are. Your thoughts, aspirations, knowledge, intelligence, and memory can all be accurately assessed from the impression you make during a few minutes of conversation. Can this be considered a "game of language?"</p>
<p>Brevity is the key to conversation. When ten or twenty minutes of conversation can resolve matters of national importance, then conversation is both simple and crucial. A master conversationalist is succinct and precise, never verbose. Excessive words will always lead to failure. Those who speak eloquently may be the least skilled. They easily expose their shortcomings in front of others, easily "reveal their cards," letting others know their secrets. "Silence is golden, speaking is silver" – this saying is insightful.</p>
<p>The art of conversation can be learned and trained. Diplomats and politicians are not born that way. Lawyers and judges must not only spend four or five years in university but also train themselves as much as possible through speeches, debates, and mock trials. "Conversation Studies" will become a discipline, and should be a discipline, and is already tending to become one. Since there are "Rhetoric" and "Debate Techniques," why shouldn't there be "Conversation Studies" or "Conversation Techniques"?</p>
<p>There is a field called "Social Control" in American sociology that attempts to control human behavior through various methods, such as praise, reward, and intimidation, to influence the actions of others. The application of these methods often relies on conversation. Therefore, they pay close attention to this. A "Social Control" expert is certainly a great conversationalist, someone who understands human psychology and is skilled in rhetoric. The dialectical method of scientific sociology is also closely related to conversation, as it instructs us to recognize reality from contradictions, understand individuals from the whole, and seek the truth of facts from the movement and development of things. Familiarity with these principles can help us achieve the desired success in conversation. Future sociologists and psychologists will inevitably emphasize this human language function, develop it, and benefit both individuals and society. Perhaps, in the near future, general schools will establish "Conversation Departments," just like the "Chinese Language Department" and "English Language Department" that exist in schools today?</p>
<p>Many great scholars have failed because they were not good at this. Many people with insufficient academic ability have succeeded with the help of their mouths. Isn't this worth our attention? Are we still treating it as a "game of language" and ignoring it?</p>

<h3 id="e277">Secret Pregnancy <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I have a friend who met a woman last year. This woman's family had already arranged a marriage for her. Later, they fell in love and had a physical relationship. Soon after, she became secretly pregnant, six months along. Her original fiancé had even set a date to marry her. How could she marry him? She had no choice but to run away to my friend's place, and they began to live together. But the wedding date was approaching, so her parents were extremely anxious and searched everywhere, finally finding my friend. Her parents were furious and vowed to never give my friend peace. Sir, what can be done? Please help him think of a perfect solution. Sincerely, Wang Mingqu, bowing respectfully.</p>
<p>Answer: When a man and a woman get too close, love often arises naturally. Therefore, those who are already engaged or have partners should be especially careful when interacting with friends of the opposite sex, because such situations easily lead to unfortunate tragedies. If one is dissatisfied with a marriage arranged by their family, they should first cancel the engagement. It is never appropriate to ignore it and fall in love with someone else, let alone recklessly engage in a physical relationship. Similarly, the other party should also exercise extreme restraint, ensuring that the relationship does not stray beyond the bounds of friendship. Even if the engagement is dissolved, but not recognized by the family, one still cannot do this and have a relationship with another person. Wouldn't that make the family even more disgusted? Wouldn't that create even more trouble and make it more difficult to resolve the problem than breaking off the engagement? Moreover, breaking off an arranged engagement, although opposed by stubborn families, is still sympathized with by society. But a situation like your friend's lover's is not only not sympathized with but also despised. Therefore, before helping your friend solve the problem, the editor must attribute it to their lack of reason and acting too emotionally.</p>
<p>But what's done is done, and what good is it to blame the past? Moreover, stubborn families who are too inflexible and completely disregard the wishes of their children, as well as modern marriage concepts, are also the main causes of such tragedies. Naturally, we cannot completely blame your friend and others. Now, the editor believes that the best course of action for them is to have her propose breaking off the engagement on their side. Marriage agreements have no absolute validity, and not complying is not a big deal. At most, it would only involve compensating the other party for their losses. On the one hand, she must also beg her parents to accept their marriage. Although her parents deeply hate their daughter's behavior, they still have a sense of parental love. If she uses tactful language and admits her mistakes, I think they will definitely not make things difficult for your friend and force them to separate. In the event that they are extremely stubborn and unwilling to agree, then she can also tell her parents that "she had no obligation to obey a marriage arranged by her parents." Her only mistake was not breaking off the engagement beforehand. Therefore, even if her parents go to court to sue your friend, it will mostly involve a reconciliation, and nothing serious will happen. The editor</p>

<p>— By George Gissing, Translated by Sun Pu</p>
<p>Awakening at eight o'clock – he could tell the time from the nearby chimes – Mr. Dunbar hurried to dress. Opening the door, he saw a tray outside, holding the smallest possible amount of breakfast food: half a pint of milk, bread, and butter. At nine o'clock, he went downstairs and solemnly knocked on the door of a front room, which opened with a discordant sound inviting him in. This room was occupied by a middle-aged man and a young girl, who were wholeheartedly engaged in the daily work of ordinary bookbinding.</p>
<p>"Good morning, sir," Mr. Dunbar said, bowing his head, "Good morning, Miss Sharg. Fine weather! Delightful weather!"</p>
<p>As if on a frosty morning, he stood rubbing his hands. The old bookbinder nodded coldly and, after hesitating, immediately gave Mr. Dunbar a task. The gentleman enthusiastically set to work. He was learning the basics of bookbinding and worked patiently, showing some natural talent, until the end of the day's work.</p>
<p>Mr. Dunbar, a gentleman from Buckinghamshire, once lived in comfort and considerable dignity on the income from sound investments, had now fallen to this state. He had studied at Harrow and graduated from Cambridge. By the time he seriously considered a career, he felt it was almost too late to do anything; and since he had no need to trouble himself with such thoughts, he settled near the village home of his wealthy and influential friend, Mr. Callman, and lived a life of simple idleness. The years passed quietly. He had considered marriage once or twice, but deep reflection made him hesitant; eventually, he realized he was born for bachelorhood and content with a single life. If only he could have seen the unreliability of other temptations with the same clarity! Unfortunately, he listened to Mr. Callman, whose usual conversation was about speculation, companies, and high interest rates. Mr. Dunbar was tempted not for his own sake; he had more money than he could use. But he thought of his sister, married to an unsuccessful village lawyer, and their six children, who, like the wealthy uncles in novels, should be happily assisted when they came of age. He blindly trusted Callman's plan, and as a result, one morning he found himself trembling on the brink of ruin; on receiving concrete reports, he fell off the cliff.</p>

<h3 id="e279">Is There a Secret to Little Star LeRoy's Expressions? (Part 1) <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Guangdao</p>
<p>In "A Bedtime Story," those of us who have seen the performance of little star Baby LeRoy, who co-starred with Heifetz, all find it a bit strange. How can he make all kinds of expressions? Who taught him? How was he taught? It's interesting to talk about it briefly now.</p>
<p>Many people say that there must be some secret method, something that cannot be done outside of filming. But it is said that there is no secret method in it. It is completely using the very simple, basic methods that everyone received when they were young, with some innovative ideas added. Plus, Baby LeRoy is an extremely clever child, which makes the task twice as effective and easy. Another point is that Baby LeRoy's caretakers like to deliberately exaggerate Baby LeRoy's abilities, saying that he has a unique talent and that they often feel inadequate. They like to say that he is a natural "actor" and that he must understand the plot. That is especially a joke. Imagine a twenty-month-old child understanding the script and knowing how to perform; it's like saying he can even read the script. However, his special intelligence, his ability to move his face, his extremely cute temperament, and his ability and willingness to cooperate with the people around him are beyond the reach of ordinary children. But to say that he understands the plot is truly an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Baby LeRoy has a thorough understanding of his personal director's intentions. His personal director is a Miss Rachel Smith. She is in charge of all the children at Paramount and has a special affection for Baby LeRoy. Wherever Baby LeRoy is, there is also Miss Smith. Baby LeRoy also listens to Smith the most. He can understand and obey all her orders, hints, and requests one by one. Many people claim to be Baby LeRoy's "discoverers," but the true discoverer is Miss Smith. She was the first to see him in the Salvation Army orphanage and pay attention to him. She was the first to coax him into making all kinds of funny movements. Baby LeRoy is able to "learn by imitation." Whatever you do to him, he will imitate, and it is extremely natural and realistic. His "feelings" in front of the camera are completely at the command of his director, Miss Smith. As for the plot and script, it can be said that they have nothing to do with Baby LeRoy.</p>
<p>When Baby LeRoy acted in his first film, he was only six months old, so there were naturally few opportunities to make him express emotions. At that time, to capture the kind of expression he needed, you could only wait for him to slowly develop the expression needed in the story. Fortunately, his responsiveness is very fast, and people don't have to wait long. He is so naturally innocent and lively that his every move is almost always worth putting in the camera. The funny thing is that it is very difficult to make him cry, perhaps because he has that lively and playful innocence, and no one can bear to make him cry. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e280">Review of "The Girl and the Boy" <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>The Girl and the Boy</p>
<p>"The Girl and the Boy" is an old work by Lilian Harvey. In terms of directing techniques, it is slightly outdated. In today's context, it cannot be said to belong to the "positive" aspect.</p>
<p>However, I think there are several aspects of "The Girl and the Boy" that are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>When Jenny goes on stage to perform, she is ridiculed by a large group of hotel servants below the stage. The noisy sounds made the Duke in the backstage anxious and unable to do anything, covering his ears and not daring to listen to the boos from the front stage. The description of the Duke being ridiculed is indeed enough.</p>
<p>But there is also positive ridicule; when Jenny and Victor meet, the description of many audience members pointing at the Duke is also good.</p>
<p>Lu Xun Bellos, who plays the Duke, is very well suited to play this ridiculed role.</p>
<p>This kind of ridicule of noble people is certainly not based on a political stance. It merely satirizes destructive vanity and sings the praises of pure love.</p>
<p>Is so-called "vanity" worth our satire? I think it is more important to fundamentally eliminate the source of vanity.</p>
<p>As for pure love, we have said more than once that it cannot but be an excessively beautiful fantasy in the present.</p>
<p>The praise, the ridicule of the Duke, is nothing more than an expression of the ideology of the urban petty bourgeoisie. They sing the praises of the warmth of spring, hating and envying those who stand above them. And isn't the bouncing singing and dancing in "The Girl and the Boy" also perfectly suited to their tastes?</p>
<p>Someone said: "If you have painful things, just go to Lilian. Her plays can often tell people some ways to get rid of pain." Doesn't this already explain their ideas? Moreover, this also explains the meaning of this kind of "musical."</p>
<p>In "The Girl and the Boy," Lilian Harvey fulfilled her singing and dancing duties under the direction of Wilhelm Thiele, but her acting talent could not be concealed, such as in the scene where Jenny provokes Victor.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Lilian's personality is flirtatious, Sophisticated, a typical daughter of a capitalist society. In "The Girl and the Boy," no matter how much the singing and dancing tramples on her personality, you can still see some of her personality after all.</p>

<h3 id="e281">"Torrential Rain and Pear Blossoms" - My Review <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Hairong</p>
<p>The acting power in this film is indeed very moving. Although the story is quite ordinary, the portrayal here is so truthful and vivid.</p>
<p>In terms of structure, we can discover Mr. Ma Xuweibang's cleverness. He has made very appropriate preparations for the arrangement of the environment, the placement of characters, and the construction of the film's atmosphere of sorrow, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>We absolutely cannot ignore the actors' hard work in the success of this film. Tan Ying had already made us discover her as an extremely promising film actor in "A Fallen Woman's Regret." Here, she plays a blind person, and she can fully express the pain of a blind person. The impression she gives us is truly very deep. Gao Zhanfei, Chen Yanyan, He Feiguang, and others have also worked hard in their performances, which is truly rare. In particular, the scene where Chen Yanyan plays a flower seller who is seduced is so moving!</p>
<p>However, we must point out the director's oversights. For example, when Xiao Ying falls on the road on her way home, he did not arrange for torrential rain, which is an oversight. In addition, things like Xiao Qin and Xiao Ying having their hair permed and eyebrows drawn are also somewhat inconsistent with reality.</p>
<h3 id="e282">Written After Watching "Torrential Rain and Pear Blossoms" <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Nai Huang</p>
<p>"Torrential Rain and Pear Blossoms," which everyone has been eagerly anticipating, has finally premiered at the Jin Cheng Theater.</p>
<p>Chen Yanyan has changed her style in this film, but her performance is still good. Her expressions are quite capable of moving people.</p>
<p>Gao Zhanfei is very careful in this film. Among his past films, I think Gao Zhanfei's performance in "Torrential Rain and Pear Blossoms" is the best.</p>
<p>Tan Ying originally specialized in performing flirtatious roles, but in "Torrential Rain and Pear Blossoms," she has also changed her style, but has instead performed more earnestly and made progress.</p>
<p>He Feiguang is working very hard, but due to the limited screen time, he inevitably has some inconspicuous moments.</p>
<p>In short, "Torrential Rain and Pear Blossoms" is a masterpiece in the Chinese film scene in recent years. The photography, lighting, and set design also have considerable achievements.</p>
<p>Director Ma Xuweibang can also be considered successful in directing this film.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Liliane Haidt's Old Partners, Henri Garat and Willy Fritsch <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Weng</p>
<p>Whenever we mention old male-female partners on the screen, we think of movie queen and emperor Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell, Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier, as well as Greta Garbo and John Gilbert, and so on.</p>
<p>Now, let me talk about Liliane Haidt again. In the United States, because she has made very few films, she does not yet have a fixed partner. But in Europe, she has two very famous old partners. One is Willy Fritsch, who is rumored to be marrying Haidt, and the other is Henri Garat. You have probably heard these two names a lot! The most interesting thing is not that Haidt collaborates with Willy Fritsch in this film and with Henri Garat in that film, but that these two old partners are used simultaneously in one film; and they play the same role, which may sound strange to you all.</p>
<p>In fact, the Ufa company often made copies of a film in three languages: English, French, and German. In the German copy, Willy Fritsch is cast. But in the English or French copy, Willy Fritsch is replaced by Henri Garat. Like many films in the past, such as "The Love Waltz," "The Road to Paradise," and "The Congress Dances," because the copies shown in China were in English or French, we only knew that the male lead was Henri Garat, and we would not have thought that there was also a Willy Fritsch. Now, the Nanjing Grand Theatre is showing "The Girl and the Boy," starring Liliane Haidt. The male lead in this film is also Henri Garat. I dare not say much about how well it performs right now. But in any case, we have seen quite a few films they have collaborated on, and they will definitely not disappoint us.</p>
<h3 id="e284">"Rouge and Iron Blood" to be Released <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Fen</p>
<p>Since the Tianyi Film Company's "The Fire of Youth," "Good Land," "Fleeting Time," and "Spring Dreams in the Palace" were released in succession, because there has been significant progress in consciousness, technique, and all other aspects, the public's estimation of Tianyi has also increased a lot. Recently, the company's "Rouge and Iron Blood" (previously named "Iron Blood Rouge"), which has been promoted for a long time, will be released in a major local theater within ten days. The main theme of this film is to starkly expose the crimes of warlords' autocracy and oppression of the people during the era of the Northern Warlords, to reveal the greatness of revolutionary forces, and at the same time to delicately depict the deep love between husband and wife and the conflict between conscience and self-interest. The consciousness is correct and powerful, and the entire film is full of climaxes, so the performance is also exceptionally passionate and tense. It is truly a rare masterpiece in domestic films. Starring Wang Yuanlong, Tang Jie, and Fan Xuepeng, and co-starring Xiao Zhengzhong, Lu Jianfen, Wang Huijuan, and Shu Lijuan. It is expected that the film will cause a sensation when it is released.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3 id="e285">The House of Rothschild (18) <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Yin</p>
<p>Nathan stuck his head out of the carriage and said to them, "I hope this whole war is not built on such a romantic basis." Fitzroy and Julie reluctantly separated. When they walked up to Nathan, he said to Fitzroy: "Colonel Fitzroy, I give Napoleon a hundred days – no more. If, after a hundred days, you are still alive – you seem to be an unkillable youth – you can come to London and talk to me." Fitzroy looked pleased and thanked Nathan profusely: "I'll be counting the days one by one." He finished speaking, and helped Julie into the carriage. Julie got into the carriage and kept sticking her head out to smile at Fitz, feeling unspeakably happy, until the carriage drove away.</p>
<p>In the days that followed, as tensions increased day by day, Julie's heart was still filled with hope. When she walked in the garden, she sang softly with boundless joy, secretly counting the days, hoping that her lover would return to her arms sooner. But in Nathan's heart, he only felt the burden increase day by day. How long could the Allied forces hold out? How many days could he himself hold out? His heart could not help but be anxious. One morning, Hannah was pinning a boutonniere on him when she said, "My dear, you are bravely holding on, but I'm afraid you have reached your breaking point." Nathan smiled, but very reluctantly. He said: "I have promised the Allied powers, I cannot exhaust my meager strength, but if the situation in the exchange yesterday were to happen again tomorrow, I'm afraid the Rothschilds will have to close their doors." Hannah trembled in fright when she heard this. She cried out, "Nathan!" She unconsciously dropped the pin she was going to use to attach the flower. She said with tears in her eyes and helplessness, "Nathan, I truly admire you. You fight for what you believe is just. Even if you fail, you will fail for glory." Nathan forced a smile: "With a virtuous and brave wife like you, and a little rose pinned on my lapel, even if I lose all my wealth, I am still the richest person in the world."</p>
<p>Rothschild ran in. He silently handed a small roll of paper to Nathan. Nathan silently read it. Then he read it out loud. It read: "Blücher's troops have begun to retreat, Napoleon has used all his strength against Wellington – James." Julie cried when she heard this. She said, "Today is the hundredth day, and Fitzroy has not returned!" Nathan felt very uncomfortable, but he still forced a smile and comforted her: "The hundredth day is not over yet. Julie, have you forgotten? I am a magician. I know that a message of love and hope is already on its way here." He told his wife, "Hannah, take her away." He then said to his secretary, "Rothschild, come with me." They went outside, and Nathan stopped. He said thoughtfully, "Carriages, rooms, servants, all that we have today – but tomorrow, I'm afraid..." As he left to get into the carriage, his boutonniere fell off because it was not properly pinned, but he did not know it at all. (To be continued)</p>
