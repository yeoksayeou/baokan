<h3 id="c20">英國調解歐洲殭局愼 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>｜德國軍備平等要之折衝案｜</p>
<p>英國對軍備縮小問題所採取之政策。近已公開發表。并致備忘錄於美德意法日比波蘭等國。查備忘錄之内容。略可分爲下述兩點。（一）取消攻擊性質之武器或减少有攻擊性質之武器。（二）促進各國取消對德軍備管理下之試騐時期。并承認德意志之軍備平等要求。設使此種提議。能獲得意大利之同感與美國之贊成者。則法蘭西雖無論如何堅執。亦不能不思所以讓步矣。</p>
<p>英國在此歐洲殭局難於打開之時。德法依然對立之際。而提出贊同德國軍備平等要求之主張。其果眞爲歐洲和平前途計。而欲藉此以克服當前之危機耶。抑藉此以安定英帝國之局面耶。此雖與英國現狀。皆有相當切實之關聯。不過此尙非英國外交上之根本意思。蓋英國迄今并未確定放棄其從來政策。卽扶植歐洲兩個强國之外交是也。</p>
<p>歐洲大陸之形勢。就陸軍實力論。任何國家。皆不能與法爲敵。毫無軍備之德意志固無論矣。卽勉强足與法國爭衡之意大利。亦祇能聯結中歐諸國。或拉攏德意志以圖牽制法國。或藉蘇聯之力以謀外交上之運用。英國在此形勢之中。深悉法國勢力過渡擴張之結果。金鎊在歐洲將無立足餘地。故不得不與意交歡。隱含對法意味。同時關於對德軍備問題。英法見解各自不同。其所以不同之故。固非僅法理上意見之參差而已。設使德意志能衝破現局。部分的改訂凡爾賽和約者。則英國地位。勿論在外交上經濟上當較今日爲有利。特别是關於軍縮殭局之打開。英國關係尤爲重要也。</p>
<p>夫今日世界軍備之競爭。不僅陸軍。尤不僅歐洲大陸。海軍與空軍同爲軍備競賽之主要目標。所謂軍備平等問題。誠爲當前最嚴重之問題。不過英當局旣老於外交。復長於計算。深知現代軍備。陸海空三方莫不趨於技術化與機械化。欲作切於實際的技術化與機械化之軍備。非其國民於科學訓練有素。經濟上力量充足。與其國境内天產物之豐富。三者具備不爲功。現在德國雖高標軍備平等要求。力主廢棄凡爾賽和約。然其實際的能力。則殊形薄弱。其國内經濟力之不足。天產物之受制限。海外市塲之狹窄等種自然條件與環境關係。皆足使德意志難於伸張其軍備。卽令獲有軍備平等之權。亦不能與法國立於實際的平等地位也。假使法國眞能放膽承認修改凡爾賽條約。允許德意志軍備平等。一方面仍舊維持歐洲現狀。則德意志所得者僅僅在外交上較爲便利。而波蘭與多腦河流域諸小國。將更傾向於法。於英法反更有利。</p>
<p>至於所謂消滅攻擊的武器。或减少攻擊的武器。此類專門界說。頗難尋求各國一致及公允之點。以往軍縮會議中。曾爲此反覆討論。而終無結果。今後是否仍蹈前轍。此刻殆難預斷。惟就過去之經騐與眼前之形勢以測將來。竊恐悲觀之成分多而樂觀之結論少。此又何故。蓋以現今國際關係。大都傾向於國家的發展。所謂經濟聯盟。所謂自給自足。所謂關稅戰。貨幣戰。等等切切。在經濟則向國家主義的經濟組織狂奔。企圖獨占勢力之擴大。在政治則植基於軍事關係之上如潛艇。如飛機。如輕巡洋艦。如步兵砲。如坦克車等。類皆不易確定其究竟爲攻擊的武器。抑爲防禦的武器也、總之任何武器。大都同時具有攻擊與防禦兩種性能。在現狀之下。甲是乙非。各有理由。在國際間終不易求得適當之結論。然則英國之調解歐局。恐最大限亦不過短其内之緩和而已。</p>

<p>（巴黎）法政府於一月前答覆德國軍縮建設之備忘錄、已於今日發表、該文内容、確如發往柏林時外間之推料、並無驚異之點、其措詞殊爲和婉、表示法政府力求和解之意向、而其性質則在覔求新方式、庶可據以重開軍縮會議、法國不允德國常備兵逾二十萬人（德國則以爲二十萬人不足擔保其安全）法國允裁减其空軍實力百分之五十、惟所解役之部分仍保留爲將來國際空軍之用、（德國以爲如不許德國置備空軍、則法國此項建議實無價値、）法國願在日内瓦提出正式建議、（德國則願直接談判、因其無意復返「和平之都」也）法國提出軍縮試騐時期建議、（德國以爲此爲歧視德國之舉、）法國建議對德半軍事組織應施國際監察、（德國主張任何監察、施諸德國者、亦當施於他國、）備忘錄全文長十五頁、上月中德國曾加審愼研究、衆意此文不能使德法立塲稍爲接近、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）本年一月一日、法國駐德大使龐賽曾以法政府之軍縮備忘錄面交德總理希特勒、其内容直至今日始行發表、其大要如下、備忘錄首先對於德國要求所依據之理由提出保留、尤以關於德國重整軍備一層爲甚、</p>
<h3 id="c44">不侵犯條約 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>其次對於德國欲與各鄰國締結不</p>
<p>侵犯條約之意向表示滿意、但謂不侵犯條約惟於不妨害現行各條約所定安全保障之範圍内始可成立、現行各條約中、尤以羅卡諾條約爲要、而不侵犯條約必須爲之增加其他新保障、俾締約國能維持獨立、不受外來之威脅、而其内政亦不受外國之干涉、」</p>
<h3 id="c45">軍備監察制 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>旋謂德國在原則上旣已贊成就地</p>
<p>按時自動之軍備監察制度、其對於軍縮會議最後數次討論時所擬議之實施辦法不知能否接受、其他各方關於此層則有歸於同意之可能、備忘錄又謂、軍縮會議截至目下爲止、曾明示其目標所在、卽德國亦無間言、茲德國提出切實重整軍備之要求、實與此項目標相違反、德國要求切實重整軍備之計畫所以不能立卽實行者、僅爲財政狀况所限耳、</p>
<h3 id="c46">兵額與軍器 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>德國要求之兵額雖爲三十萬人、</p>
<p>但在此數以外、尙有多數警察、其軍事性質已爲軍縮會議所公認、又有正式軍隊以外之軍事敎育組織、此種組織、任何公約草案均未作爲軍額計算、是則名爲三十萬人、實則未知幾何、以此與他國相較、未免太不公允、關於軍器問題、備忘錄謂、德國要求在數量上質地上立時重整軍備、此舉在事實上、如欲公平實現、必須先謀各國軍制之劃一、而軍制之統一、非數年不爲功、此層卽德國亦承認之、至於軍備監察制、德國雖在原則上加以承認、但對於運用時期則提出保留、抑知未來軍縮公約能否切實履行、全視監察制能否確切運用以爲斷、又况德國所提要求無異重整軍備一種完全計畫、此種計畫、如由未來軍縮公約予以承認、又何異於重啓軍備競爭之門、</p>
<h3 id="c47">分期裁軍制 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>此在法國方面、則準備接受另一計畫、卽按照歐洲政局不安情形、及實行上所必需之條件、而將英國所提軍縮建議加以修正、以達到分期限制軍備、並完全實現平等原則、法國擬於軍縮公約實行最初數年、卽參照德國國防軍改採徵兵制情形、將法國陸軍人數予以减少、冀使兩國軍隊編制歸於一律、法國並承認一切軍器以現有程度爲限、不再曾加、凡軍械口徑超過公約所許之限度者、法國亦願停止製造、是謂第一期、又在此一時期之内、軍備監察制必須予以調整、對於各國軍額及軍器之製造與輸入均皆適用之、目是以後、凡軍器在質地上超過定限者卽逐漸予以廢除、其在目前、因和平條約受有限制之國亦逐漸許其置備、法國對於上述各點、願卽規定數額、載於軍縮公約之内、惟此種問題、在討論時、欲求實効、當由關係各國共同磋商、是謂第二期、</p>
<h3 id="c48">空軍减五成 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>法國對於德國爲表示第二期裁軍</p>
<p>之重要性起見、特於備忘錄内略舉數例、以槪其餘、例如活動砲之口徑、法國可以减至一百五十五米里、此種口徑、係未來公約所允許者、此外法國並擬由軍縮公約開始實行數年之内、卽將現有空軍設備减少百分之五十、惟以各主要國空軍如數减少、並對民用航空設置曁製造實施有效之監察爲條件、</p>
<h3 id="c49">國際空軍制 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>備忘錄又謂、各國軍用航空當悉數予以廢除、而代以國際空軍、法國準備大量裁减軍備於是可見、此與德國所言者正相反、第仍有賴於德國之合作耳、備忘錄又說明法國對於現行談判絶無閉門之意、至德國政府聲明、希特勒總理對於兩國未來爭執、無論何時、均準備以友善態度解决之、此層法國引以爲幸、</p>
<h3 id="c50">無領土爭執 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>而法德兩國之間並無關於領土之爭執、目下各種問題大部份皆爲歐洲問題、非由各關係國及國聯會予以處理、恐無解决之望、亦可於希特勒總理所表示之意見中見之、備忘錄最後又云、各種問題均可以互相了解圖謀解决、德國退出日内瓦、不惟於德國本身不利、且足妨害國際合作、切勸德國能在最宜於國際合作政策之範圍以内仍與各國通力合作、所謂最宜於國際合作政策之範圍、蓋卽國聯會是也、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>羅馬表示滿意</p>
<p>美國不置可否</p>
<p>（倫敦）下院定本月六日辯論英國之軍縮備忘錄、法國對此備忘錄頗有訾議、惟羅馬方面、因英意意見脗合、表示滿意、聞意國大約將接受英國建議之大部分、但對於意國所施初步軍事訓練制之取銷、不能贊同、且以英國之建議、範圍視意國爲廣、故頗疑未必能受一般滿意之接受、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務副卿費立潑斯向報界宣稱、英意兩國對德國軍備問題皆已發表意見、國務院對於歐洲因此釀成之局勢、不願加以評論、英國業以備忘錄内容通知國務院、但美國無庸予以答覆、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國爲軍縮問題致各關係國之備忘錄、中有一段謂德國重回國聯會及軍縮會議、爲軍縮公約成立之主要條件、此間消息靈通人士批評此段文字、謂德國重回日内瓦固爲吾人所希望者、但不能指爲必不可少之條件、不過英國備忘錄所以對德讓步者、其目的乃在使德國在軍備平等原則上感覺滿足、英國人士以爲如此行之、則德國可重回日内瓦矣、政界人士以爲英國備忘錄可爲以後談判之基礎、固不問其爲列强會議、抑係軍縮軍議、或各國間以通常外交手續進行談話、固無不可以英國此次之建議爲基礎、至於意大利發表之計畫、不過將意相在羅馬與英外相西門提議之事、重行簡略說明、此間人士對之頗爲緘默、至英國外交部所提之新建議、英國與論大致贊成、就英國極端右派言之、其所以贊成者、以爲英國此次出而調解乃係最後一次之試騐、如再失敗、則英國卽可回復其行動之自由矣、（一日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（柏林）柏林日報評論英國備忘錄與意大利發表之軍縮計畫、略謂英意兩國之用心或者欲使軍縮談判之綫索不致中斷乎、蓋法德現正單獨談判如不能有成、則法國急欲將軍縮之討論重行移至日内瓦也、該報又謂、英意之舉動究屬滿意、因如此則軍縮之談判將繼續不斷也、政治外交通信報將英國樂觀態度與意大利注重實際之心理比較論之、英國尙希望在小範圍内從事裁軍、而意大利則視若干國家不願裁軍之志願爲一種困難解决之事、以爲此事不容漠視云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— 力行</p>
<p>由沙市西上行程歴盡峽灘的艱危</p>
<p>一月二十六日晨、舟發宜昌、歷西陵峽、而至崆艙、此地水底暗礁甚多、舟行迂迴曲折以避之、最險惡處、纔可容一船、領江者小心翼翼以從事、若稍一不愼、卽有覆舟之險、繼至新灘、水力奇急、約在每小時十五哩以上、此種天然水力、本可利用之以發生電力、今乃爲行舟之阻碍、若船中發動機力不能勝過水力、必須倩岸傍居民以巨索牽引而上、居民視此項絞灘酬勞費爲唯一收入、不知其他、故此種天賦之富源、僅爲輪船公司與居民調劑貧富而已、</p>
<p>午後入巫峽、傍晚始盡、舟行其間、隨流輾轉、去處無門、來源無路、汽笛一聲、回音四合、設想古人以扁舟旁崖夜泊、月明之夜、猿鳴水響、自不勝凄凉之感、「巴東三峽巫峽長、猿鳴三轉涙沾裳、」此種景地、在當日是誠實的描寫、卽今乘輪船身歷其地、猶覺不能體貼其意、時代不同、感覺自異、傍晚、歇於巫山縣、縣長馬嗣良君來船相晤、得悉該縣略况、政治財政與各地皆同、礦藏極富、所產無烟煤、品質雖佳而無銷路、巫山有高唐山神女廟、然破廟土山、毫無足觀、</p>

<p>製造糖果的前後</p>
<p>— 洗冠生</p>
<p>這幾年國内工業，已由純粹舊式，轉變到模倣製造時期，且許多輕工業，確已有相當的成协，可見二十年來的中國，各事停頓，惟工業方面，呈突飛猛進之勢。</p>
<p>國產科學糖果，亦輕工業的一單位，從芝麻糖一變而歐式糖，且色香味三者，在在堪與舶來品一見高下，也可見搆成現代的新興局面，冠生園也是努力的一員。近十年來，我們所出的糖果，已達百餘種之多，十大糖果，乃是我們略敢自信的一部份。想不到洋商盤據下的國内糖果市塲，近幾年逐漸失去原有的地位，這當然是國人愛用國貨的結果，然，畢竟在無形之中，保留了許多的國家元氣。</p>
<p>現在我且告訴愛用國貨的同胞，關於我們製造糖果的前後。</p>
<p>舊式糖果沒落的初期，正是外洋糖果猖獗的時候，英美日諸國輸入於先，其他各國競爭於後，國内市塲，幾完全受洋商的支配。原因當時關稅主權，盡爲客卿所操縱，且當時糖果輸入，不過供給平津等地的外藉僑民，無人注意，便不徵稅銀，所以外國糖果，盡量的入口了，最初還不過流行於貴族階級，數年以後，外人極力經營，纔普及通商口岸的上中階級，當時以糖果國籍計，有英，美，德，法，日本，瑞士，荷蘭，俄羅斯，諸國，以種類别，則五花八門，應有盡有，尤以某國的口香糖，營業最大，在洋商互相角逐的局面下、我們的經濟損失，不言可知是極大的數字，冠生警惕這一危機，因是開始自造，希望從微小的本位，挽回局部的利益，今日之「十大糖果」，正是我們十年來努力的小成績。糖果的主要條件，有色香味三者，然自信可請國人嘗試，嚴格批評，是否可與舶來品一爲比較。</p>
<p>挽回利權，這自我當初自造的動機。但尙足爲國人告者：（一）機械設備，動輒數百萬，要在工業萌芽時代，集中這樣巨資，談何容易，可是我們的應用器具，大多自家創製，費用雖小，功效則同，這是我們打破艱難環境，實行工業救國的一端。（二）我們始終沒有西洋技師。留美專家，全仗多年的經騐，與時時研究的態度，逐漸達到預定的標準。（三）歐式糖果原料，大都採自外洋，這樣，雖在商品上挽回一部份權利，但原料上依舊是極大的損失，所以我們除了不能製造者外，其餘則採取原料的自給政策，（四）優美糖果至少要（Ａ）原料道地（Ｂ）滋養豐富（Ｃ）甜味適中，十年以來，我們對於上述三點，上步未敢放鬆。同時舶來糖果，價格奇昂，不能適合普通階級的購買力，然和我們的價格相較，冠生園出品，約廉十分之四五，减輕顧客負擔，原也是當初製造的動機。</p>
<p>言盡於此，一切尙請我惠顧諸君，不吝指敎！</p>

<p>據孔氏云、財政部此次在四中全會中所提之田賦案、經大會通過後、業已交行政院研究辦理、惟各省田賦徵收情形、因地而異、如何酌請减稅、從事整理、尙須待將各省歷來所呈報者作爲依據、詳訂辦法、始能實行、因若必再事調查後舉辦、恐時間過長、實現較難、至於各省縣所已辦之土地陳報、爲免手續起見、亦卽旣往不咎矣、</p>

<p>至於洋米洋麥徵收進口稅問題、當去年八月卽經立法院通過、嗣因宋部長在倫敦出席世界經濟會議時、我國加入關稅休戰、未曾舉辦、迨至十一月十六日、我方通知關稅休戰各國、正式退出後、因須於一個月後方能有效、同時於本人就職後、各方皆促余舉辦、故於十二月十六日始開始實行、以救濟本國農產品、公布以後、粤省方面仍係無稅口岸、因粤省方面米麥兩種、皆須仰供於外也、但因國内供求方面、仍未能調劑於平衡、故嗣後决繼續設法、使長江一帶同產米麥、向兩廣方面輸運推銷、調濟於平、於救濟國内農村經濟、奏效必益宏、</p>

<p>嗣記者又叩以麥粉商要求减免之事、財部態度如何、據云、此事實緣美麥價格過高而起、蓋自美棉麥借欵中、有一千萬美金購美麥、因美麥價格過高、例如世界麥價爲二元五六角、中國祇二元二角左右、美麥則須二元八角、故商人因此頗感困難、現美國對於價格方面、迄未允減、但財部爲體恤商人起見、必不致商人過分吃虧、現正在磋商中、</p>

<p>｜｜答何常君（續）</p>
<p>承你關心我們的「讀書問答」，快慰得很。「讀書問答」，雖然　生還不過一月，接着各地寄來的信件，都是有口同聲的勉勵我們，使我們只有更加努力，别無他話可說。至若你所提的標準，也原是我們預定的。目前討論的都是一般的問題、在有些讀者看來似乎它太高深，空洞，又有些讀者以爲它太淺薄，近於老生常談。這些意見，也都有一些根據。在本部其他工作尙未做到十分完善時（譬如自學叢書尙未能卽日出版），那些急於欲獲得一點具體指導的朋友們自然認爲不滿足，對於一般的討論，不免要認爲高深。反之，自己學力已有相當能力的朋友，看了我們東一篇西一篇的讀書討論，所談的並無高深玄妙的評論，自然要認爲「老生常談」，不値一顧。不過，我們是亦有理由的。第一，我們原來的標準是在提高趣味，是爲一般學力未豐的讀者而設的，「不是特爲智識者　一學術探討的園地，我們極願做到平凡，通俗，沒有「玄妙高深」的地步；第二，我們却不能遷然低級趣味，不能不與它奮鬭。我們今後當由一般的討論，漸漸近入範圍較小，較具體的第一問題，然解脫仍要力求通俗，務使沒有進過學校的人，人人看了都能了解。我們相信：祇有讀者將更具體，更實在的問題提出越多，我們引路人纔能越引越達到更實在。我們决不會不顧實際，而憑空抬高「指導」的水準；除非是合於讀者一般實踐的要求。</p>
<p>現在再進而略言如何克服低級趣味罷。</p>
<p>無疑的，上海多數市民尙沉溺在低級趣味中。這種表現不僅是在讀物上可以看出，卽在娛樂和各種生活的活動中。亦無不如此，就整個說，這是社會經濟基礎的一種反映，不足爲怪，我們對於它不必存着厭惡，輕鄙之念；但不能不與之奮鬭，使之提高，因爲它同時有給政治經濟進展的反作用，我們不能讓它再蔓延下去。現在我們專講「低級趣味」的讀物，也是一樣，它是封建意議的結晶，它有束縛思想「向上」，「自由」的作用，我們不能讓它繼續存在，使大家生活往後退。</p>
<p>克服這種趣味，自然不是很簡單的一件事，不能由一道命令，卽可除去。也不祇是憑你「開導」，就會得着他的信服。根本的破除力在社會一般生活環境的改善，敎育與文化水準的提高，新的意識漸漸的取得統治的地位。沒有迷戀舊的骸骨基礎了，自然不能生出這種趣味的讀物。鴛鴦蝴蝶派在今日的中國尙有回光返照的勢力，不是沒有緣故的呀！</p>
<p>但是加速他們沒落的進程，自然是我們大家的職責，也是實踐的需要。可是這工程所涉的範圍，包括批評；新的作品的介紹和一切觀念上的糾正，然全體說，本部自然只能做到其中的一小部分。並且，目下可能做到的是要大家不把嗎啡作飯吃，而換一樣衛生滋補的食品。</p>
<p>至於如何去宣傳「衛生」的福音呢？這確是件難事。譬他的趣味非讀「玉黎魂」不可，你切不可馬上要他去讀石炭王，因爲這兩種「趣味」相隔太遠了。你不要怕麻煩，你應介紹他一本較「玉黎魂」略高級的讀物，性質都相隔不太遠的，譬如「情書一束」罷，給他讀。等到他覺得白話寫的小說也够有味，你就再進一步，送他一本迷羊，漸漸的多量給他一些高級的讀物。等到他已有了一些自覺時，你可以介紹他一些更高級或者簡直很硬性的東西的給他，他也不會再迴避了。這是然引道說。</p>
<p>以外自然是應擴大對低級的東西｜舊的｜作無情批評，通俗的，詳盡的曝露它的弱點，在積極方面，不僅要有新的代替，還應做得「高」而不「深」。關於這一點，我們很有把一些高深名貴的東西，編寫通俗的願望，但是這也要靠社會上大家的努力，不是依靠少數個人所能成功的。</p>
<p>本部對於「讀書指導」工作，卽决定採以上的方法，同是兩封問「文學應如何着手」的信，我們的回答也許完全不同如某甲略有根底，我們就直接介紹他些高級趣味的東西。某乙若非常喜歡「古董」那我們並不急急的要他作不可能的跳遠，只是介紹些換換口味的調胃劑。所以我們這種工作是比學校敎育麻煩，然而，却甚實際。因此，這部分工作只能作個答覆，不能在「讀書問答」欄發表。在形式上，也許在我們答覆信的留稿中可以發現一些矛盾，但這是統一的敎育過程上一定的順序。</p>
<p>最後，我們希望何君　熱心敎育的先生們，對於以上的言論給與嚴正的批評。</p>

<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>辦法，不拘伺時，不拘何地，不拘對於任何一件事，不拘在怎一個環境中，都是少不了的一件法寳。</p>
<p>無意打中了頭彩，而沒有在未開彩之前，預訂就打中了頭彩之後的生活綱要者，自然和得眉頭一皺，眼白一翻，想一個處置這一筆鉅額奬金的辦法。否則便會手足無措。</p>
<p>開出窗去，對面恰巧是一位摩登女子的臥室，若是你要與這位摩登女子一通欵曲，那就非想出一個辦法來不可。若是這位摩登女子對你落花有意，而尊駕倒是魯男再世，偏要流水無情，那你爲了要避免煩惱起見，也得要想一個辦法。</p>
<p>大個兒合小三子打架，大個兒的腦袋給打開了小三子的胳膊給打折承屋簷下打瞌睡的巡捕，邁　方步踱過來，招呼着二輛黃包車，送進醫院去。這也是辦法之一哪。</p>
<p>丈夫，吃喝嫖賭，無一不玩，家用一切，置諸腦後，或是遇到了猛　兇悍，蠻不講理的妻子時，對手方總也不免要思前顧後地想出一個辦法來。</p>
<p>水來土掩，兵來將擋，便是一個例。同時，空城計，獻地圖，牽羊肉袒城下之盟，都不能不承認是辦法。焚書杭儒，自然，更是防止作亂的好辦法。</p>
<p>因此，我們也不用詛咒内戰，因爲内戰是或種人找求出路的辦法。我們更不用詛咒朝裹無人莫做官，因爲這辦法是朝裹人救濟窮親極友的尾　。</p>
<p>一回亂子之後，我們總見到大人先生捋着鬍子說，總得籌一個善後的辦法。雖然這個辦法，是否果能實施，實施了，是否果能善其後，都在不可知之天，但是「總得想一個辦法」，總是一個天經地義。</p>
<p>到了無辦法時，自殺。其實，「自殺」，就是一個辦法。所以我以爲惟有在「無辦法」口號下生活着的人，才是世界上最沒有辦法者，而該一挨着苦。</p>

<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>盤飡市遠無兼味，樽酒家貧只舊醅；可與鄰翁相對語，隔籬呼取盡餘杯。」這首杜工部的詩，描寫田舍友朋往來醼叙的藥趣，似乎比在都市開香賓，喫大菜，來得天眞吧。一到了冬天，田舍滿堆了稻，麥，芋，　；田圃裹種了許多菜；塒棚裹養了許多雞，鴨，豬，羊：老妻織成了多疋的土布；女兒來燒香噴噴的飰；兒子來釀濃郁郁的酒。不要錢來買煤，何須裝水汀，備電爐，燒着獸炭柴草，可以取暖，可以造飯，「衣」「食」「住」生活上的要素，那一種要仰給於人，俯拾卽是。都市裹的人們，享得着這種淸福嗎？</p>
<p>雖然住在蔀屋茆簷，究竟吸着淸爽的空氣，曝着和暄的日光，望遠山，聽流水，烟雲飛鳥，綠樹靑雲，天天給你享受。都市呢，那一個讓你享受。栖栖皇皇，風塵滿面，何苦呢！何苦呢！</p>
<p>猙獰都市的黑影，籠罩着人們，狡猾，欺詐，兇惡，瘋狂···病態，都發現了。天寒歲暮，急景凋年，都市裹越顯出窘迫的面顏來了。在田舍間，酒馥飯香，負暄野語，但話桑麻，不問治亂，的確是「天之驕子」呢。雖說農村破產，畢竟沒有匪患的地方，比都市來得好呢</p>
<h3 id="c225">夜倦 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 胡德芳</p>
<p>有人說夜是醜惡的，因爲人們是隱蔽在黑暗的幕下，作着種種違反理性的動作；一到夜裹，善良的變爲罪惡了，純潔的變爲汚濁了但這是夜的神秘的誘惑使之如此的麽？還是套着虚僞的面具的人們顯露了眞面目呢？又有人說夜是美麗的，夜是這樣的幽靜，月光是如此的柔和，星星陜着秀眼是怪惹人愛的，高塔矗立的雄勢、溪邊山上流水的琤琮，花枝樹影的婆娑，冷雨敲窗的丁東，主在夜裹所展示的，是百十倍的富于詩情，讓人們去詠歎或者歌頌；夜是具有着無限美麗的姿態的，至少在一個熱情者的眼裹。</p>
<p>像我，我不能因爲夜的醜惡而就咒咀伊，我更不會因爲夜有如此的美麗而就贊賞伊，夜祇給予我一種好感，這好感是當我在工作的時候使我懷記伊，因爲伊能讓我在一天的工作疲倦之後熱情的勾住我倒在伊的懷裹，我安息着，異樣的甜適，靜穆，一切罪惡的意念，一切幻覺的追求，去遠了，去遠了，我有時甚至會自己聽見夢裹的笑聲，夜使我依戀着，雖然我們到時候還是不得不分手</p>
<p>天色越顯着朦朧，空間像飄散着無數靑灰色的烟層，師鳥，一枝箭似的射過去了，模糊中，似沒入雲端裹去了，阿花是祇會張開半支眼睛望着你了，雖然伊依然是仗在你的脚邊；在小妹妹甜睡的領域之下，畫片口琴和歌曲集子也散亂的互相依偎了躺在着；雛雞找不着母親合起雙眼不住吱吱仰着頭呌···這是一幅「夜倦」的圖畫，而夜，也就在這時候替世界覆上了一層薄薄的面紗。</p>
<h3 id="c226">竹夫人與湯婆子 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>在熱得人發昏的炎炎夏天裹，日間勞苦了一天，晚上要想息息，無奈炎威逼人，睡在屋内牀上，卽使你一絲不持，揮着大蒲扇子，依然是汗流浹背，難於入睡。這時要是有一個竹夫人來給你擁抱而睡，那你便要覺得遍體生凉，週身舒暢，自然魂霝靈出竅，再也不苦熱了。因爲竹夫人不但是天生麗質，而且是冰肌雪膚。試想，有這麽一個美人兒似的竹夫人，給你擁抱着睡，艷福不淺，還想何求？再要嚷熱，那眞是「天曉得」了！所以竹夫人在夏天是無人不愛的思物，尤其是大塊頭仁兄，更少不了伊。可是一到了金風薦爽，溽暑全消的時候。晚上睡覺，已覺得夜凉如水。那麽。這時的竹夫人，已好比靑春老去一樣，不合時宜，便要如秋扇之被捐了！</p>
<p>至於湯婆子，我們只要一聽見伊的尊姓大名，便可知道是一個鷄皮鶴髮；旣胖且矮；性子火燥的老婆子，那裹有竹夫人這般冰肌雪膚的天生麗質？更沒有竹夫人這般温存體貼的幽雅態度！總以爲是沒有人歡喜的了然而不然，豈知在這個天寒地凍的寒冬時節，正是湯婆子得意的時候。謂予不信，請看一般人在這寒冷的夜裹，誰不要把湯婆子拉進被窩裹去共温好夢？任憑湯婆子再醜陋些，大家對了伊只知道熱鸞（『熱戀』二字用於此義帶雙關），不會得厭棄。你想，阿要稀奇　？</p>
<p>雖然，我由此感覺到人生在世，得意失意，也是這樣。譬如：人家得着你時，便巴不得把你捧上三十三天。用不着你時，便恨不得把你打下十八層地獄，甚而至於踢你一脚也好的。唉！這樣看來，人情冷煖，本來是沒有一定的啊。那麽，竹夫人與湯婆子，忽而被人歡喜，忽而被人厭棄，又何奇之有呢？</p>

<p>第二十三回</p>
<p>創痛難堪凝神聽鼓樂</p>
<p>歡情未洽促别到飛符</p>
<p>江氏聽了他這番話，也呆了站着望了他道：别是口外風聲不大好吧？自强笑道：那倒不，也不至於。正說到這裹，在新房裹坐着的桂枝，可就聽到了。手叉門簾子，斜着靠了門框，就向趙自强望着，問這：剛才有一位客，打城裹來，就是替你送電報來的嗎？趙自强點點頭，答應着是。桂枝看看母親，再看看丈夫，故意鎭靜着自己的態度，用很柔和的聲音問道：你那電報，給我瞧瞧行不行呢？趙自强怎能够違拂了新</p>
<p>夫人的態度，只得慢慢的在口袋裹抽那一通電報，雙手交給了桂枝。伊接到手上一看，乃是：</p>
<p>北平西直門大街恒豐米行，轉趙自强連長，奉圑長諭，囑卽日回心防，不得停留，切切勿誤。營長寳芳。</p>
<p>桂枝對於這電報上的文字，碰巧竟是完全認得，兩手捧了那電報紙，拌顫個不定，他心裹的話，也就不言可喻了。</p>
<p>第二十四回</p>
<p>酌酒傳餐狂歡含别涙</p>
<p>挑燈温夢低唱度長更</p>
<p>趙自强這次回家來完婚，大家原都知道是種短局，但是不滿一個星期，他就要走，這是趙自强自己也料不到的事。趙翁在屋子裹面聽到有電報到來，伸頭張望一下，又看到堂屋裹站着的三個人，是那一副情形，心裹頭早就瞭然，於是正了顏色向自强道：當軍人的人，身子是國家的，在前方你能請着假回來完婚，這就是很難得的了。旣是寳營長有電報來，你就趕快回營罷。時局平靖一點的話，我也想到口外去看看，我帶着桂枝同楊家老太太一塊兒也到喜峰口去罷（二三七）</p>

<p>申報無線電週刊礦石機十要  李元慶　　許多人以爲礦石機的效能，是有限的，一時是不易增進的，這話固然也有相當的理由。但是如果你在設計時，能加以特别的注意，使用時又能耐心地守候，那麽接到遠距離的播音，也並不是一件困難的事情。　　本文特將設計礦石機時應注意的各點，開列於左，以便讀者參考。　　（一）我們知道礦石的檢波能力，是有限的，牠本身並沒有放大的作用。所以要得到響亮的聲浪，第一便要天綫裝得考究。據實騐，天綫卽使加至二百呎，也並不嫌長。至於高度，當然愈高愈好。　　（二）固定礦石，使用時固然很覺便利，但是牠原來的接觸點、往往並不是最靈敏的地方，並且日久又會失掉靈敏度。這類礦石，祇能供給一般的需要，如果要增進礦石機的效率，以採用調節礦石爲宜。　　（三）綫圈須採用可變直接感應式，可以適合任何式樣的天綫，並能减少因間接感應而生的損失。　　（四）在調節綫路内，磁感量（綫圈）愈大愈好；電容量（可變儲電器）愈小愈好。　　（五）用矽化　（Ｃarborundum）檢波，並用電位器調節，使得適當的電壓。這一點能增加選擇性。　　（六）綫圈採用較粗之導綫，以减少電阻及分配電容量（Ｄistributed　Capecity)損失。但不能過粗，過粗又將引起渦流損失。（Ｅddy-curent　Loss）普通大約以十八號左右的導綫爲最適中。　　（七）綫圈直徑以採用較大者爲宜。　　（八）有時更改礦石的方向後，也能增進效率，使用時須分别試聽之。　　（九）加裝輸出變壓器，如配合得法，能增加音量。（參閱本刋第三十九期）　　（十）礦石的本身，絶對不可沾染油汚或任何雜物，最好每隔數天，用酒精洗刷一次。　　附圖所介紹的礦石機，是美國Carborunduin　Co的工程師依據了上述各要點而設計的。牠的音量，靈敏度，及選擇性等，都臻上乘，但是構造都十分簡單。綫圈，用十八號紗包綫在直徑四英寸圓筒上繞五十圈，每隔十圈抽出一頭，頭尾共計六個綫頭。（見圖）Ｐ爲具有中分點之二百歐姆電位表。使用時先移動滑鍵Ｓ，次調節可變電容器以得到最響的聲浪爲度，再較準電位器以得到最優美的成績爲止。此機曾經著者及友人（均居住南京）等親自試騐，在冬天晚上曾聽到日本的播音，聲浪雖不響亮，但是即還淸楚。閱者試騐後如有心得，還祈不吝指敎。鑛石機應用之機件  魏心蘇　　礦石機因其運用之能力，全憑天綫所收得之電壓，故其効力如何，惟視應用機件之採擇與裝置而轉移。今就礦石機應用之機件分條加以叙述。　　綫圈｜—綫圈爲司諧振之主要機件，如僅用一只綫圈，如第一圖者，則其圈數之多寡須視天綫之長短與高度而異。又有用二只綫圈如第二圖，利用射電週率降壓變壓器增大其流通於次級綫路之電流。上二式之接於礦石之分綫，如置於圈數愈少之一端，則選擇性愈銳，若調整得宜，則靈敏度與音量均甚佳，但如其前後加有眞空管擴大器及遇雜聲騷擾時，則以射電週率昇壓變壓器式綫圈爲宜。如嫌上二式之選擇性尙未甚佳，則可用第三圖之雙連配諧綫路，但音量則須减去一半矣。第一圖　　電容器｜｜電容器用於配諧綫路者，以空氣絶緣可變式爲宜，其容量用於廣播波域者以·０００３５，·０００４６及·０００５第二圖爲最普通。用於調整天綫者，（見第二圖）則須視天綫與初級綫圈之自感量與電容量大小而定。如天綫長綫圈圈數多，則此電容器之容量須大，反之須小。礦石機之聽筒，如跨以支路電容器如第二圖，有時可以增加發音淸晰。其容量可用·０００５mf　　礦石｜｜　可用於檢波之礦石種類甚多，最主要者有方鉛礦ＰbS，矽礦Ｓi及矽化炭ＣＳi等。方鉛礦之接觸點須小而輕，如得其適當之處，靈敏度極佳。矽第三圖礦觸鬚之壓力須較大，其靈敏度稍低於前者。矽化炭須大壓力之接觸。靈敏度次於矽礦，但接觸甚穩固，便於使用。礦石之最高靈敏度可得於其特性曲綫變動最大之處。有幾種鑛石如矽化炭一類，須加Ｃ電但助其達此靈敏度最高之處。第四圖卽一矽化炭檢波綫路，籍分阻器校準礦石至特性曲綫變動最大之處。鑛石之表面須保持淸潔，忌手指接觸，蓋人手之汗油能使其効力減弱也。第四圖　　聽筒｜｜聽筒之優劣依據其安倍圈Ampere　Turns多少而定。其多者爲優，少者爲劣。視歐姆數値選擇者不甚可靠，蓋綫有粗細與成份之不同也。　　天綫｜｜標準之天綫爲七根或七七四十九根之紫銅綫，如用其他金屬導綫亦可，惟以耗阻最低者爲最佳，長度普通以一百尺爲度，如處於電台林立之中心，則二十尺已足。天綫愈長愈高則靈敏度愈佳而選擇性愈劣；反之，則選擇性尖銳而靈敏度低落矣。特殊的礦石機綫路  石華玉　　不是說礦石機的靈敏度和選擇性都遜於眞空管機嗎？要怎樣結構起來牠的靈敏度和選擇性才能最大的發揮呢？對於這個問題現在在這裹介紹一張用礦石的外差式綫路給讀者。這綫路是我一個朋友所發表的。外差式是要一隻振盪器的，但是因爲礦石沒有振盪的能力，所以振盪管的一席，仍不得不請眞空管擔任，好在主要部份仍在礦石，眞空管不過是一位客人罷了。所用材料也不多，已經有一燈機及已裝過礦石機的，拚凑起來也還可以應付裕如。ＣＩ和Ｃ２一樣，都是·０００５mfd。C3是·00rmfd。C4同Ｃ５也是·０００５mfd.C6是·００２mfd眞空管祇要能够發生振盪的都可以應用，所以Ｂ電Ａ電Ｃ電圖中都沒有註明。Ｒ·Ｆ·Ｃ.是用三十號漆包綫繞三百圈在三英寸直徑的圓筒上。天綫用環狀天綫，可以增加不少選擇性。Ｉ·Ｆ·Ｔ是中間週率變壓器，其餘的綫圈照三回路綫圈繞就是了。礦石珍語ＲＦ　　礦石之檢波作用之發現，乃在三極眞空管發明之後。　　一九○六年美國人命武台（Dunwoody)始發現炭化砂（卽金鋼矽）有整流作用。其後又陸續發現多種礦石，亦有同樣之作用。後卽利用供檢波之用。　　凡導電體之礦石，均可作礦石檢波之用。　　普通礦石收音機中之礦石，均用爲半波整流。　　中國藥店有售之自然銅，可供礦石檢波之用。此物名黃鐵礦，乃硫磺與鐵之化合物（　Ｉron　Pyrite　FeS2）。外國人普通名之爲「笨伯之金」，因其外形甚如黃金也。我國人則常呼之爲自然銅。但自然銅中並不含金或銅，故以學理言之，上述二普通名稱，殊不妥當。　　礦石收音機中，若將礦石與觸針互易地位，亦可收音，有時效力更佳。　　矽化炭用爲礦石檢波，效力較他種礦石爲優，因其能通過之電流量較大也。但觸針對於礦石之壓力須甚大，否則效力不顯。　　中國現已有國貨礦石。增加鑛石收音機音量的方法  朱紫源　　礦石收音機無論選擇性·收音距離，以及音量等都够不上一隻單眞空管的收音機，這是當然的。不過省費和淸晰，是牠的唯一優點。所以我們仍然不能放棄，而要想種種方法來改良牠的缺點了。例如選擇性，我們可以在天線回路裹想法，改良天地線和環境，可以增加收音距離。這裹所講的，就是增加礦石機音量的方法。　　方法很簡便，我們祇要添購一隻四百歐姆分壓器（Ｐotentiometer　400　Ohms)和一節手電筒上的獨節電，連接的方法如下圖。　　這不過舉一個例，其他的礦石機都可同樣接法。使用的時候，我們在收到播音以後，可以旋動分壓器的滑桿，以得到最響一點，以後可不必再動了。本刋前已發表關於礦石機之文字　　題目　期數　作者　　選擇性很好的礦石機　六　蔡光華眞空管礦石兩用機　二二　身礦石收音機（一）（二）　三一至三三　黃鑑村一隻優良的礦石機　三九　純鋼礦石掦聲器　四零　崇武靈敏的礦石收音機　四六　葉德燦内外消息　　▲無綫電讀本出版：無綫電讀本爲申報叢書之一種，係黃鑑村先生最近著作，内容豐富，尤偏重於收音機之構造，製造以及設計方面，全書計分六大章，附綫路圖百餘幅，爲一不可多得之良書，凡吾無綫電之讀者皆宜人乎一卷也。該書實售洋五角。總發行處申報特種發行部，外埠申報分館各大書店均有經售云。　　信記固定電容器近訊：信記無綫電機廠出品之信記固定電容器自發行以來，銷路頗暢，蓋其容量眞確，耐電壓高，式樣美觀，定價克己，故頗受業餘家之歡迎，聞各大無綫電行均有經售云。　　無綫電廣播與敎育：法國敎育部議决凡所有敎員均須備一收音機，以收聽廣播節目云（飛利浦社）　　▲天耳無綫電公司新到另件　天耳無綫電公司，素以著名修理收音機稱道於申，茲聞該公司兼營各種無綫電零件，近由美國運到各種零件計電磁喇叭，每只售洋九元，放音變壓器，每只四元，三連電容器，每只十二元，又有中間週率綫圈等不勝枚舉。詳細情形，可通函上海仁記路三十五號該公司詢問云。　　▲鷹王牌收音機在美銷數驚人，去年十二月一日至十五止，鷹王牌收音機之銷售數目，已超過一九三一及一九三二，十二月之兩月銷售之總數，良因該機一九三四年式之所用材料，發音，式樣，皆爲人所意想不到之精良所致。又鷹王牌新任廠長惠立姆氏云，在最近數月中，已售鷹王牌收音機，三十萬只，爲自一九三十年來所未曾有之驚人數目云。康茂無綫電社介紹　　茲有友人託代售最新式高貴收音機一只，十二燈，並連有留聲機自動調片機，原價一千八百元，僅用過一月，願以一千二百元出讓，如有意購者，請至本館無綫電週刋部秦熹敏君接洽可也。　　明襄，李元慶，蔡光華，ＲＦ，葉德燦，王璇生，史家安，一知，朱紫源，魏心蘇，泡諸君鑒，一月份稿費請於本月六日至十日，十六日至二十日下午二時至四時憑來稿所蓋圖章蒞本館會計處支取爲盼。　申報無綫電週刋部啓</p>

<p>自由談「京派」與「海派」　　自從北平某先生在某報上有掦「京派」而抑「海派」之言，頗引起了一番議論。最先是上海某先生在某雜誌上的不平，且引别一某先生的陳言，以爲作者的籍貫，與作品並無關係，要給北平某先生一個打擊。　　其實，這是不足以服北平某先生之心的。所謂「京派」與「海派」，本不指作者的本籍而言，所指的乃是一羣人所聚的地域，故「京派」非皆北平人，「海派」亦非皆上海人。梅蘭芳博士。戲中之眞正京派也，而其本貫，則爲吳下。但是，籍貫之都鄙，固不能定本人之功罪，居處的文陋，却也影響於作家的神情，孟子曰：「居移氣，養移體」，此之謂也。北京是明淸的帝都，上海乃各國之租界，帝都多官，租界多商，所以文人之在京者近官，沒海者近商，近官者在使官得名，近商者在使商獲利，而自己也賴以糊口。要而言之，不過「京派」是官的帮閒，「海派」則是商的帮忙而已。但從官得食者其情狀隱，對外尙能傲然，從商得貪者其情狀顯，到處難於掩飾，於是忘其所以者，遂據以有淸濁之分。而官之鄙商，固亦中國舊習，就更使「海派」在「京派」的眼中跌落了。　　而北京學界，前此固亦有其光榮，這就是五四運動的策動。現在雖然還有歷史上的光輝，但當時的戰士，却「功成，名遂，身退」者有之，「身穩」者有之，「身陞」者更有之，好好的一塲惡門，幾乎令人有「若要官，殺人放火受招安」之戲。「昔人已乘黃鶴去，此地空餘黃鶴樓」，前年大難臨頭，北平的學者們所想援以掩護自己的是古文化，而惟一大事，則是古物的南遷，這不是自己澈底的說明了北平所有的是什麽了嗎？　　但北平究竟還有古物，且有古書，且有古都的人民。在北平的學者文人們，又大抵有着講師或敎授的本業，論理，研究或創作的環境，實在是比「海派」來得優越的，我希望着能够着見學術上，或文藝上的大著作。惻隱之心  樊仲雲　　「惻隱之心，人皆有之」，孟老夫子的轉語更說，「無惻隱之心，非人也」。　　但我近來感覺到寗可不是人，而爲動物，爲木石。　　因爲由同情共感而發生的一點惻隱之心，往往是悲哀痛苦的根原。而在這社會，到處是使人憤慨傷感的資料。然憤慨傷感實大背君子修養之旨，我們要做到有唾面自乾那樣的功夫，纔配生活於這當前的時代。　　讀過了聖賢書而穿上長衫的我，畢竟修養功夫還不到家，所以眼見着兒子的夭逝，而不禁失聲痛哭，三數日來，心頭悒悒的滿是凄凉寂寞之感，走到街上，看見人家的小孩，甚至看見那畫着小孩的廣告，就會引起滿懷的傷感。　　「孩子旣是這樣的難養育。何以滿街多是小孩呢」？這是妻的話。　　是孩子死時的一幕：｜在□□□□醫院中，我和妻滿懷酸楚的噙着涙珠，給孩子洗身更衣，三數友人扳着面孔立在一旁，房間中是一種嚴肅悲哀的氣分，但是看了我們這種傻氣的樣子，覺得好笑的，是一個滿面脂粉的時髦看護婦。　　「把Cream拿來」，是衣服業已穿好後，妻對我的說話。妻想在已死時的孩子面上，搽一點Cream，因爲孩子生時，我們照例是這樣。　　我便轉過身去，在這瞬間，我聽到那個婦人的笑聲，我恨不得一拳打過去，然而畢竟因爲有過唾面自乾那種功夫的練習，是個長衫階級中的人物，不是一般所謂苦力，我只說請她不要站在這裹，但她的辯答却說，這是她的職務，她不能出去。　　我不知道這個婦人的胸中，有無心肝這一件東西，但是這種冷酷無情的態度，我覺得正是現在社會所需要的。最適宜於現社會的人物，便是打着慈善的招牌，而抱着冷酷的居心的。所以在□□□□中，有這樣冷酷無情的看護婦，也正是現社會的常態，而並不是由於所謂「最毒婦人心」。　　其實，沒有一點人心，有什麽關係，只要滿面塗上脂粉，就已儘够漂亮時髦而無往不宜了。因爲這個社會所需要的便是美其羽毛的禽獸，倘若沒有幾分禽獸的居心，我怕自己早進瘋人院或者自殺死了。放眼世間，這樣的人物何嘗不是盈天下皆是呢？見了□□□□醫院那個看護婦的冷酷的笑而憤慨，亦適足見背了。　　爲了免去自身的傷感，並希望能够適應這個社會以生存，所以我也想寗可給孟老夫子斥爲「非人也」，而爲禽獸，爲木石。無用的東西  周楞伽　　因爲溥儀要做皇帝，於是乎久經打入冷宮的皇帝這名詞，現在便又突然時髦起來了。前幾天致立先生在自由談上曾談到皇帝，可惜他所談的只是帝號問題，很少談到皇帝本身。據我所知，自古以來的皇帝，除了少數從馬上得天下的創業的「英明天子」以外，其他繼世守城的皇帝，大多數都是無用的東西。　　秦始皇是中國歷史上野心最大的皇帝，他併吞大國，廢封建，立郡縣，造萬里長城，銷天下鋒鏑鑄金人十二，遺徐福入海求仙，坑儒生四百六十人於咸陽，不但想自己永遠高據寳座，而且想把他的皇位二世三世至千萬世傳之無窮。然而他的兒子二世就很無用，未及再傳三世，便已把國亡了。我們且看趙高遺他的女婿閻樂去殺二世的時候，這位二世皇帝是怎樣應付的。　　「二世曰：丞相可得見否？樂曰不可！二世曰：吾願得一郡爲王弗許。又曰：願爲萬戶侯。弗許。曰：願與妻子爲黔首，比諸公子。閻樂曰：臣受命於丞相，爲天下誅足下，足下雖多言，臣不敢報。麾其兵進，二世自殺。」　　二世臨死時的願望，很可以代表一部分無用的末路皇帝的退一步哲學。皇帝做不成了，便自動的向後退，從郡王萬戶侯，一直退步到只求保全性命便是做一個小百姓也願意。而結果還是辦不到，不免於自殺。做皇帝的人無用到如此，連一些反抗的勇氣都沒有，眞使人止不住爲之一哭。　　和二世一樣無用的皇帝，歷史上差不多每一個朝代裹都有。似乎一坐上這皇帝的寳座，人便會變得　茸無能一樣，不能不令人歎爲異數。劉阿斗的「此間樂不思蜀矣」這句話，顧得够多麽懦弱無用。而唐明皇以萬乘之尊，竟不能庇一愛寵楊貴妃，坐視馬嵬埋玉，一籌莫展；迨夫蜀道聞錦，「三郎郎當」之聲，思之可憐又復可笑。他若陳叔寳三日以眼涙洗面，李後主之「故國不堪回馬月明中」，梁武帝之餓死臺城，建文帝之出家做和尙，都充分的顯出了他們的無用。至於像晋朝的懷　二帝，宋朝的徽欽兩宗，以一代君主，竟在異族前靑衣　鼓跳舞，則皇帝簡直無用到出醜了。無怪乎某一個末路皇帝要說什麽「願子孫生生世世勿生帝皇家」也。　　歷史上所有的亡國之君都是很無用的，而無用也就成了他們亡國的主要原因。不過也有一個例外，那便是弔死在煤山上的明思宗崇禎，他實在不失爲一個英明的皇帝，他的亡國只好說是命運，不能說他無用。民心思亂，朝代注定了要更迭，縱有回天之力，也沒有用處。這使人不禁想起歐洲歷史上被民衆執行死刑的英王查理第一和法王路易十六來。雖然皇帝是一人之下，萬人之上，非常尊貴的，但也要把持得住民心，如若發號施令，都和民衆的願望違反，則陳涉之竿一揭，皇帝的寳座就不免要動搖了。　　現在且回過頭來談一談溥儀罷。溥儀也是一個亡國之君，遜淸的二百八十六年江山，便是斷送在他手裹的。他的人似乎並不怎樣有用，卽使做了皇帝，也决不會立刻就天亶聰明起來。何况他又是一個有日本人在後面牽線的傀儡皇帝，比較稱契丹爲父到中國來做皇帝的石敬塘還要沒有權力。則他以後的命運如何，也就可想而知的了。火  揚帆　　已經過了正月半，賭，照例是不應該再開了。然而村子上王五家却還開着，並且有繼續下去的趨勢。　　婦人們都想採取干涉的行動：摔「盅盆」，搶「頭子」，哭哭閙閙，把大家吵散塲。這些，在農村，是普通不過的現象，而且也是她們所做慣了的。但是現在，即誰也不敢，誰都有點怕着惡狗王五！　　不錯，王五是近來村子上擁有特權的人物，他的登龍術是和保衛圑的班長拜了把。　　正月半已經過了四天了，王五的賭塲却依然開着。　　木匠阿根的老婆可　　起來了。她眼看着阿根米也不量，把「年夜頭」收到的工錢一個個都輸了去。過了正月半不是可以出去「做生活」了嗎？然而阿根只管賭。　　｜總是惡狗王五害人｜　　　她恨恨的說。　　可是她畢竟想到了一個制止的方法了。那方法已記不起是誰講過的，但她知道的確有效。｜只不過作點巷｜　　一個思想重複在她的腦際幌過：放火！　　但是她决意實行了。在若明若暗，星光稀微的黃昏，她獨個兒，悄悄的，打村子西首穿到王五家的後面。還是寒冬，冷風吹來，她接連打了幾個寒噤。汪汪汪，屋檐下的狗　散地呌着，並不緊張。　　她摸着預先藏在袋裹的火柴，準備擦；但同時又想回去，這作孽事不做了。雖則是柴積，王五的同居陸大娘也是苦人家。　　然而她她一想到惡狗王五開賭的害人，意志却又突然堅决了。她想，假如嚇散了那賭塲，許多女人都會感謝我呢！　　於是她把火柴勇敢地擦了，點了東首，又點了西首，柴積熊熊地燒起來，她却拐着小脚沒命似的逃跑了。　　乾柴烈火，又給西北風煽動着，霎時間，半天通紅了。鑼聲一嚮，賭塲裹的人都竄出來救火，見是柴積，心裹明白，但却不能不救，敲冰，打水，捺水龍，忙亂了一陣子，，總算熄了，燒了三個柴積，幸虧不曾上屋。　　一簇一簇的婦人們談了起來，說是好在村子上有水龍，不然禍可闖得大哩，西北風，火星飄上去便是南面的屋。但還談到了别的，王五開賭害人，活該！只苦了陸大娘。　　陸大娘哭着，駡着，要和王五算賬；因爲三個柴積她的頂大，而且燒乾凈了。人家兩個都小，而且只燒掉一小半。　　從此王五的賭不開了，只陸大娘並不曾賠到什麽。别人都勸陸大娘說：王五是光蛋，旣是燒了，也就自認悔氣罷。　　木匠娘子微笑着，因爲阿根已經出去做生活了。奶媽（一）  徐轉蓬　　他踏着山坡上的晚霞從鄕下回來。進城時，街燈亮了。灰淡的暮色網住整個城市。他家中的人，妻和二個孩子，圍繞着小圓桌坐着，正在用晚膳。九歲的大兒子林生，脹起面孔麻煩母親，他要喝酒瓶里的五茄皮酒，那是母親剛喝乘下來留給他爸爸的。母親用盡應付的技能：恫嚇，說好話，咀咒，賭氣。可是倔强的孩子，沒有一滴酒到口是不甘心的。母親懲罰他，不許他坐在桌子上，孩子站在桌角，嗚嗚的像貓一般的哭着。母親剛生產二個月，那貧血的淸癯的臉上，因爲内的煩躁，也冒上了火。「等爸爸回來打你！」　　爸爸是個律師，做過一任縣長，革職後利用先前的名譽和地位，執行了律師職務。今天被人請到鄕下去調解一件命案。去時和妻說定，最遲天黑，便會趕回家裹。外門的門鈴響了，爸爸拖着疲乏的沉重的脚步走進來，便在籐椅子上躺下了，沒有等妻間話，便掀動着那二片厚厚的楮色的嘴唇跟妻說：　　一碰巧得很，今天眞碰巧，也可以說你的好運氣，也可說孩子的好運氣，我在鄕下雇到個奶媽了，他自己的孩子剛送進育嬰堂去，生產不到四十天，是血奶。你天天喊着要雇個好奶媽，今天雇得了，···你看了定會中意的···」「怎麽被你雇得的？」「是一位朋友介紹的。」「多少年紀了？你見到人沒有？」「見到了，看去有二十一二歲。」「眞年輕囉！」說到這里，妻把話拖住了，遲疑着，閃着那神秘的眼睛：「奶媽面貌很好看吧？」「明天便來了，你自己看罷！」妻仍搭東搭西的追問，···因爲要喝酒，和貓一般哭泣着的孩子，這時也停止了哭，豎起耳朶聽着。父親拖過他那小而圓的手臂。「林生，明天又給小弟弟雇個奶媽來了···」孩子合母親同樣的搭東搭西嚕囌的盤問。新來的年輕奶媽，今晚只能在他們虚構着的想像中浮畫出來。　　（二）　　第二天奶媽來了，她是個至多二十二歲的少婦，面孔被日光晒黑了。耳後，頸上粘着汚垢，有一朶朶和靑苔相似的黑斑，大槪因爲白天穿着不潔的衣服，晚上蓋了齷齪棉被的原故。鵝蛋形的臉，額角分明，是剛刮過面的。如果把她和女主人相比，她的鼻子太偏，沒有太太那麽高高的好看，她的眉毛太粗黑，沒有太太那麽生得聰明。在面貌上看，奶媽是個平常的人，但年紀很輕，好像比太太小一倍。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言所謂黃禍  瓊聲　　自從羅馬亞洲學生大會，慕索里尼高唱東西文化結合以征服資本制度所造成的「世界災害」之後，現在復從慕氏之口向歐美各國呌出所謂「黃禍」的論調。據二十一日東京電，慕索里尼以一國之元首，在美國報紙上發表其排日言論：「日本國民富有好戰的犧牲精神，武力亦頗旺盛，中國現在雖似係日本武力之好餌，然於不久將來，可成爲强力統一之國家，白種人文明之遠東制覇，與太平洋之命運，繫於今後百年間中國發展之如何···今日黃禍論雖不如昔日之猛烈而非政治的軍事的黃禍···已迨至世界市塲，白種西洋諸國不得不爲政治的合作，調停東西文明之鬥爭」云云。　　慕氏在高談東西民族「永久結合」，并反對資本主　銷售之「尾閭」之後，忽然又以「黃禍」警告歐美，　勸白種西洋諸國作政治合作，調停東西鬥爭，觸眼看來，似乎自相矛盾，前後不符，但是細加研究，便覺大有至理，奥妙無窮。　　意大利在地中海和東歐與「歐洲野牛」　法國不斷衝突之後，感覺「前途夢多」，乃轉動他貪婪的目光到二十世紀　「地中海」太平洋來，另圖發展。這卽是白種人文明之遠東制覇　繫於中國之　　　　　　與倡導東西民族結合「命意」之所在。本乎此旨，乃不惜以反對，　　以東方弱小民族作商品消售尾閭的　　　，企圖向東方伸出他的巨手。　　與「同文同種共存共榮」的口偈，自亦原無二致。至於中國　　　這樣聰明的人　　　東西民族結合以反抗資本主義造成一世界　　　，自己到民到民族獨立解放之道，自然是「與虎謀皮」，飲鳩止渴一樣的滑稽。　　但是在慕索里尼「東西民族結合」，以挽救世界固有「文明」的美名下，若與太平洋四大列强英美法日一起「扯破臉」，那自然會根本影響慕氏地中海祖國的存在，這無危太冒昧莽撞。所以在他認爲造成「世界災患」的資本列强，就不能不有所「鑒别」，爲鞏固他地中海位置前提下，大有「借重」於英美法，因之在慕索里尼所放與東方弱小民族圑結反抗「資本制度」的「大砲」之後，復輔以白種西洋諸國政治合作調停東西文明鬥爭的「理論」。這樣來旣可在太平洋舞台上留下「側身加入」的機會，也不致「開罪」於緊接的鄰邦，但是這就必然與日本對立。日本外務省對此問題之「非常重視」，認爲「排日言論」并訓令駐意大使提出抗議也是這個理由。　　談到我們罷，慕索里尼雖大聲疾呼着「黃禍」，我們雖黃，素來酷好和平，萬不致成禍，絶非以我們爲的，鎭靜是最好的態度。何况慕氏還一再的贊揚我們東方文明，見好於我？雖則慕氏還過慮着我們「不久將將來可成爲强力統一的國家」，難免提心弔担究竟也太渺茫，得看「今後百年發展如何」，目前絶無「重視」此事，訓令駐意大使提出抗議之必要。　　如果慕索里尼眼中「黃禍」萬一也將咱們放入眼裹的話，也不十分嚴重，僅可重申「同文同種」之誼以相拒抗。若這一政策被拒，也可搬出慕氏贊揚爲我們所固有的「東方文明」，講幾句「友愛和平」，定可得到諒解。所以「黃禍」的理論，雖然激動世界，我們絶無重視的理由。談酒  阿曇　　周作人先生紹興人，紹興的酒，是有名的，所以周作人先生，雖則「並不十分喝酒」，但是終於做了關於酒的文章。除了叙述酒的趣味之外，還告訴了我們「女兒紅」等名色，可見卽使「不十分喝酒」但是住在出酒的地方，到底連做起酒文章來，也便當些。我是不喝酒的，又不住在有名的出酒地方，那末，做起關於酒的文章來，不消說是困難不過我終於做了。　　中國人喝了一輩子酒，同時駡了一輩子酒，「自然讚美酒的人也不少」自從禹老夫子說過一句「後世必有以酒亡其國者」，他的灰孫子桀先生，就證實了這句話，接着凡是亡國之君，就多少和酒有些瓜葛，灌夫使酒駡座，幾乎丢了頭顱：李白喝醉了酒，一失足吊在潯陽江裹，就此嗚呼，這是盡人皆知的事，此外因爲酒而誤事，不知有多少？　　雖則如此，因爲喝酒而得到帮助的，也不是沒有。李白「一斗詩百篇」，武松喝醉了酒，使出醉八仙拳在景陽岡打死白額虎，還是小事更有趣的酒並且救了兩個晉人的生命：　　王允之和王敦夜飲，吃了先睡，王敦就和另外一個人商量作亂，商量已畢，想到臥在牀上的允之，恐怕他聽到，洩漏消息，就想殺以滅口。恰巧允之沒有睡，完全聽到他們商議的事，並且知道王敦要疑心，就用指頭在喉中一扼，方纔吃的酒菜，全部嘔出來：等到王敦來看，就以爲他沒有醒而不殺死他，這樣酒就救了王允之的生命，假使允之不喝酒，就沒有什麽會吐，就是硬扼出來，沒有喝酒，也沒有嘔吐的理由，王敦就一定以爲他聽到而殺死他了。　　阮嗣宗名重一時，司馬氏忌之，想找一個　　殺死他，就派一個人去說親並且决定假使嗣宗不答允，就殺死他，嗣宗知道來意，答允又不是，不答允又不是於是就拚命喝酒，大醉六十日，弄得媒人沒有說親的機會，就此溜掉，這樣酒又救了阮嗣宗的生命。　　最近酒的功效，似乎更大了，在美國，酒就决定了兩個功黨的勝負，民政黨上台，羅史福戰勝胡佛，開酒禁，是有大關係的。在中國，那末，黃浦灘，唐沽口幾盅香濱，就保全了行將毁滅的大上海和快要陸沉的華北。　　是的酒是麻醉的，但是他先使人興奮，使人在興奮之中，不知不覺的麻醉下去。這樣，酒就更適合於現代。因爲在目前，我們就看到了無數的使人在興奮之中，不知不覺的麻醉下去的玩意。　　「酒落歡腸」得意的人因爲要增加興趣，而歡喜他，「事大如天醉亦休」，失意的人，因爲要忘了悲哀而歡喜他，「何以解憂，唯有杜康」，「遇酒且呵呵人生能幾何」，在生命幾乎不能苟全的亂世，酒的消費量，一定會繼續增大的。就是我，也因爲想到酒而有這篇文章好寫。最後我更想告訴讀者一件事：　　詩人杜甫的死，據說多吃了牛肉白酒。那末酒的確能够殺人的，劉伶的死，焉知不眞正是吃酒吃死了，世上自殺的人，一天天的增加，但是自殺的方法，似乎最進步不過吃安眠藥片，我想用酒來自殺，他的趣味與快樂，是更勝安眠藥片的。當舖  高地　　右手指上套着朋友韋君愛人的戒指，我獨自走上辣斐德路。天空陰沉着，滿是灰白色的雲。樹葉全落了，只賸下稀疏的空枝。一種毫無生氣的蕭條的冬意罩壓着空寥的長道。黃昏的影子在每個門前搖幌了。　　情緒有一點茫然，什麽也不願多想。也許是近來破夢太多，且半年來生活在心理上生理上頂不如意的情形中，把情緒磨練得光芒減少，於是像吃過虧學了乖的孩子一樣了。　　轉上蕯坡賽路，我進了一家當舖的門。櫃臺高高的，站在臺内的收當人約算比我高三尺，地位是居高臨下的。當我遞上戒指時，他便熟練地戴上大眼鏡，又用小小的放大鏡在戒指上照了一下，只把眼皮睜大一點，瞳仁在燈光下向上一眨，說，「這是廣東金子？」「是的。」我順口答着，看着他仔細從容地用戥子戥着。「八分半···」他呢喃着，又問，「要當多少？」「你說當多少？」「六塊錢，最高的價錢。」　　這生意就這麽做了，我於是等待着。這時，一個小孩子捧着火油風爐來當，接當的人還是那個老練的收當人。他出八角，小孩子要一塊，且說，「這是天天要用的，就要贖的。」每天要用的東西也有時不得不拿出抵押，抵押甚至出賣肉體和生的人也是常有的。生活的滋味實在是可怕的，許多人從降生的時候起便被生活壓迫得一世不能抬頭。在好多地方，弱者的涙正是强者歡笑的泉源，這已是好久的事了。　　接過當票和鈔票，我便走了出來。這是我第一次進當舖，覺得頗有情趣。雖然不是自己當東西，在第一次的意義上不完全，可是接當票這却是第一次，於是我心裹想，在上海我第一次進當舖了。　　另外一件不同的往事又想起來了。時間退回到五年前，是十八年的冬天。我乘來上海之便，到吳淞去看一位通過信的朋友。他初見到一個陌生人的面孔時有點詫異，我遞了一張名刺，他明白了是誰，便立刻高興地握了我的手，要我坐下，開始同我談起來。我臨走時，他約我第三天去玩。　　第三天我去了，只見到門上有一個條子，說到上海去有要緊的事，要我在房裹候他。我一直等到下午，還不見他回來，便留下一個條子，我回上海轉南京去了。在南京接到他的信，說那天是去上海當了皮袍，打算買點煤回去和我烤火談天，但只買兩個火缸，他於是只對着空缸發呆。　　他的失望和心裹說不出的懊喪，都可以從字上看出。我悔恨不曾多等他一會兒了。他也許會想到爲何不早回吧？　　這悵惘在我們心裹積蓄了好久，到時的歡喜。有一次他同來上海，臨回吳淞時，一同到當舖裹贖了他的皮袍，這正是因我而當的東西，却難得有機會一同贖回。皮袍是放在皮包中一起當的，他接着皮袍，我們相顧微笑了。　　這件事還是淸楚的在我心中，並且還想起有一夜他和我憑着窗子聽樹聲，說着他在湖南及北京的故事，還說了「十年」後再谈的話。十年已經過去了三分之一，生活已從夢想的降到現實的，我只有祝福遠在北方的這位前進不懈的朋友了。　　回到朋友的房裹時，他問我：「當了有五塊錢吧？」「哦，六塊啦！」「六塊？」朋友於是高興起來，計算着如何把錢用去。　　我心裹想，在上海的新見聞多了不少，連進當舖的經騐也有了。上海的將來  雪菲　　近來上海消費事業大爲發達，什麽大飯店大戲院大跳舞廳等，不斷的接踵而起，而且越開越大，東也是一個皇宫，西也是一個皇宮。堂皇華麗，後來的總要超過前起的。總而言之，繁華到了頂點。　　然而一方面我們却聽見商店蝕本；馬路上儘管終年滿街掛着「大廉價」，「削本大减價」的旗幟，店員們還是終年請在店裹淸坐；熱閙馬路儘多房子空着，長年沒有人租用。市面的蕭條，也到了極點。　　這些爲了什麽呢？很顯然的，這是證明了中國的農村破產不但一度一度的加深，而且影響到都市的衰落了。　　因爲農村破產，所以内地金融，不斷的向都市｜尤其是向上海方面流出，財富集中於都市，於是暫時形成了都市的通貨膨脹，表面上一時顯着很興盛的現象。但這表面的興盛現象是不久的，因爲内地金融流至上海後，並不投於生產事業，而只供幾個銀行家作投機事業，一方面這項大批遊資，還要不斷向外洋流出，久而久之，這暫時繁華的都市也變成貧瘠了。工廠减工關門，大批工人失業，進而影響到一般　人購買力的降低，商店無業可營，於是結果便又形成了都市的衰落。　　但這衰落與都市中一班有錢人係的是沒有關有錢人的生活，並不因都市的衰落而减退，剛剛相反，農村越破產，都市越衰落，有錢人的生活只有越繁華，越豐富，這因爲農村的破產，都市的衰落，直接間接都不影響到他們收入的减少，剛剛相反，只有農村越破產，都市越衰落，社會上一切都發生動搖，他們無事可做，只好以有用的錢儘量投之消費事業去作他們的消遣了。再加目前一切在幻滅演變之中，他們除了極度的享樂，也着實沒有别的出路。這樣，大飯店大戲院大跳舞塲等便接踵而起了。　　這是一定的，經濟的衰落，只有從日用品生產部門中才看得出來，奢侈品生產部門里不會看到衰落狀况的。鋼鐵　　農產品等的生產與消費，儘營衰落，絲綢金珠香水化裝品一切奢侈用品的生產與消費，總維持着一定的水準。各國都是如此，中國也不能例外，這因爲有錢人生活，並不和一般社會經濟發生密切關係，任是一般經濟衰落到如何程度，他們的享樂生活，始終只有向前發展的。　　現在上海一方面市面蕭條，一方面高等消費事業特别發達，這還沒有達到頂點。不久我們一定會看到柴米油鹽布店連續關門，一方面大飯店大戲院大跳舞塲更多開設，更爲富麗。滿街飄着迷人的音樂，衣香鬢影，醉舞酣歌。而所有的窮人們呢，則一個個躱在草蓬子裹鴿子棚裹挨餓。　　這便是上海的將來。一位作家的生活  散嘉　　從各方面觀察的結果，知道三層樓上那家新近搬來的房客是一位有名的普羅作家。當我得到了這個消息的證實以後，我是十二萬分的高興，因爲我可以一瞻大作家的丰采哩！　　是一個長長的靑年人，穿着很挺直的西裝，打着鮮艷的領結，臉上似乎從不會有一絲笑容。　　家庭的組織很簡單，除了他以外，有一位「顏如玉」的夫人，一個還不能走的孩子。用着兩個用人：一個燒飯，是男的：一個管孩子，女的。　　我很想領敎一些作家如他的洪論，然而我始終提不起勇氣來和他談話，眞的，當我們看見「裴司開登」的那付冷面孔時，誰都會懦弱的！　　但我始終是佩服他的，因爲他能够呐喊，作勞苦大衆的先鋒，把勞苦世界中的事介紹到社會上來！我以爲他是一個勞苦者的愛人！　　然而事實上，完全出我意料之外了！　　每當我上晒臺收衣裳時，我總要經</p>

<p>過他的房門。在理想中，我以爲他家中的布置一定是極簡單而樸素的，可是，從門隙裹看到的是一家木器店似的：立體派的床，桌，椅，···十分鮮艷，十分摩登！　　皮大衣，汽車···都不是一個平常人所能有的，然而他全有着。　　十二點鐘才聽見呌臉水的聲音，開留聲機，尖着喉嚨唱洋歌，偎倚着夫人的臉看着馬路上的車夫笑，一塊錢一天的飯菜。　　孩子哭，女傭就得挨臭駡，當然，自己的骨肉受欺凌委屈時，勞苦大衆就會忘了的。　　「這就是普　　　　　我自己問自己我想不道這　　的　理。　　「你爲什麽　　　　東西。」有一次朋友，這樣問我。　　「不過爲了七錢三而已！」我笑着說。　　突然，我　意到那位布爾喬亞的普難作家，我知道了所有的道理。　　「爲了錢才會向勞苦大衆呐喊啊！」業餘信箱抗日戰士的結局編者先生：　　現在我有一件極困難的事情來向你求救，想先生或者亦不至於置之不答吧！　　我有一位熱心而好學的朋友，因爲無力求學，所以在十餘歲時，便由人介紹進了一爿舊式商店做學徒。但是他在空閒時間，還是孜孜不倦的努力求學。後來由其友人慨然資助，讓他入某中學求學。事有凑巧，「九一八」事件的發生，正是他求學時代，當時各學校先後組織抗日圑體，紛赴東北，那時吾友因憤日軍之橫暴，亦棄學加入某圑前赴東北，加入義軍工作，出入於冰天雪地槍林彈雨之中，置生死於不顧，眞個是飽經艱苦。　　自去歲華北軍事恊定成立，抗日軍後援斷絶，於是倍受日僞軍之壓迫，死亡枕藉，慘不忍睹。吾友迫不得已，偕同戰友數人，遄返北平求救，奈北平後援會，非但對他們置之不理，就是由關外回來之受傷戰友，亦不發給養，聽其自然。以致他就求救無門，乃親自到油添作胡同國府賑委會北平分會朱將軍處，朱將軍亦面現難色，僅發給路費若干，命其返滬。去歲底吾友由北平轉輾來滬，暫居其友處，（按吾友父母俱亡）至此失業失學交相煎逼，生活困苦異常，自不待言。日前他曾來吾寓，倩吾代籌日後辦法，言時聲涙俱下，吾百思不得辦法，以應吾友之需。故特冒昧來信，懇乞借貴刋一角之地，求救於讀者諸君前。希望讀者諸君能爲其解决生活，或鼎力資助其昇學，俾將來爲國服務。同時使此孤苦戰友得有一求學機會，努力上進，而成其偉大未竟之壯志。（按吾友年僅十九歲，品行端正，一無嗜好）松濤謹代吾友以萬分誠意向諸讀者泣呈求救。　　張松濤謹上　　編者按：在冰天雪地中，爲着我們整個民族謀解放的忠勇戰士，竟不料會得到這樣的結局。這是多麽够使我們歎息啊！然而，我們能給他們想些什麽好辦法呢？　　張君也知道這點，所以不使我們爲難，僅請求我們把這封信公佈於讀者諸君，之前，希望諸君能够爲他的朋友想辦法。當然，這是義不容辭的；不過，我們公表這封信的意義，是不僅要使諸君知道抗日戰士的悲慘結局，並爲他們想辦法，同時更應積極地研究「抗日反帝」的辦法，擔負起實踐這運動的任務，千萬不要受了這個刺激而灰心。因爲這種責任，是在民衆身上，民衆能共同擔任責任，這種悲慘的事情纔不會發生，運動纔有成就。自我職業介紹　　兪錫珍君，紹籍，年二十四歲，曾服務商界多載，現顧任公司洋行練習生或賬席收賬員等職，薪水不計，並備有相當舖保，通訊處浦東北護塘路三十三號。　　周希賢君，浙江諸曁人，年二十六歲，初中畢業，曾任紗廠職員三年，小學敎師二年，文字淸通，辦事幹練，對無綫業，攝影，繪畫諸技能，亦多旁通，現顧供力所能及之職，通訊處戈登　來坊，三六一　二十二號。　　　君，浙江人，二十三歲，初中畢業，願，　　投函　　　　　里五昇四十五號葉君。　　鳴謝　茲承航空　報　　　航空。書「異　　出　　　　鳴謝。毛哥哥寳妹　遊世界  猛挅菱度日　　４９這個地方多猛獸，我們且向哪裡走！　　５０這裡有菱角，我們來摘着，拿到市上賣点錢，我們兩人好過活！　　５１寳妹看見菱角多：站在岸上笑呵呵；毛哥摘着菱角很不少：心裡喜個飽。　　５２脚一滑：跌一交：水花四面跳；菱角隨手向上抛，寳妹嚇得不得了！小說孤獨的人（五）  黛妮　　（三）上海的一天　　這一天，離克佳的婚期尙差三天。克佳原籍杭州，家中只有他的祖母，父母早過，沒有弟兄。他在上海職業上的進欵，因爲家中不需要他養家，所以他的個人生活是很餘裕的。和靜宜的結合，他的祖母沒有說什麽老年人理說的話。在老人家的心理，對於一脈單傳的孫兒，祇要沒有越軌的行爲，結婚等終身大事儘可以不作什麽主張了。不過希望他們結婚之後，回杭州居住些時，她的像死水一般的心中，可從孫媳婦身上收復她早喪兒子的悲哀。克佳對於他的祖母，一如普通的兒子的承歡膝下，這一次他回杭州勸效蓀來滬，沒有到家中去走一轉，自然是例外的。　　他們到了上海，靜文帮着妹妹，整備嫁衣裳。效蓀被克佳委任了佈置新屋的責任，到晚上一所空洞洞的三層住宅，已井井有條，盡善盡美。尤其是新房，效蓀運用他從前寫生裸體的藝術手腕，這里，那里，璧飾，沙法···所有電燈，全用綠色的，在柔和光線下更使人感得軟玉温香的餘味。　　「克佳，三天後的晚上，「滿室生春」這屋「小弟弟辛苦你了」野牛拍着他的肩頭「她們姊妹停會同來參觀，我喊阿福呌幾個菜來，咱們樂上一晚。」　　克佳下樓去了，效蓀抽着捲烟在室内打轉。自從到杭州養病之後，他一切的思想都改變了。終日價的玩，近處膩了，跑到很遠的寺廟古刹中去住幾天。雖然靑年的志向和往昔的豪氣都和山湖景色同化，微風的吹拂也好，細雨斜打也好：親身受着的家庭苦痛，社會擯棄，及勤菠的不别而行，都像靑煙似的消散了。生活誠然是平凡，在杭州他沒有一個親信的同伴，神經質的想起了就向克佳發了封哀的美頓書，然而這類淸幽的生活至少在矛盾的效蓀心中並不致十分厭棄。現在重臨離别了三個月的上海，轆轤般的心和零亂的思潮重湧上來，久被遺棄的悲哀又輕輕地叩着他重創的心扉，一時不知怎麽去處置牠。來回的在室中蹀　，下意識地投身到法發里，仰首望着上升的燈圈像一隻從戰塲上戰敗歸的老馬，換了一枝捲烟，搖着天然鬆曲的頭髮，有意無意地觀看克佳朋友餽贈的禮物等於在失眠的時候數字的方法一樣他重行近梳妝檯隨着手拾起一個竹刻的花瓶，不由的暗贊中國手工藝的登峯造極。别說望着像眞宜興的陶器，不是克佳說過是竹頭的東西，誰都不會信任自己的眼睛的。突然像怪物般的幾個字嚇得他抑止的心潮狂奔起來。而這幾個字在他眼前放大放大，至於看不見旁的東西。克佳同靜文姊妹上樓都沒有聽得，他們見他摩挲着這花瓶不肯釋手的樣子，克佳笑着說：「勤菠送的東西倒底不差。」　　效蓀不願意見勤菠甚至不願意聽見勤菠這名字。但是他更不願意在一個新認識的女子面前被克佳取笑，毫不在意的把花瓶歸了原位，見食指和中指的香烟只賸了烟尾，就投進脚旁的痰孟里，也笑着說：「我不知送什麽禮物好呢？」</p>

<p>電影專刊島格拉斯永不再回美國嗎？  西林　　好萊塢切盼他早日言旋　　否認在英組織影片公司　　爲什麽島格拉斯范朋克要這樣做？爲什麽他要離開好萊塢，那裹每一個人的臉，都表示着是他的朋友，每一個靑山，都顯露着這是他的家鄕｜｜去到一個生疏的地方，和生疏的人相處着？爲什麽他要放棄了領袖的地位，竟是君王的地位，多少年來屬於他的｜｜去和外國的爵位貴族混在一起？難道做了好萊塢之王還不足嗎？爲什麽他竟離開了他自己帮助着建築起來的事業｜｜去恊助别國的影戲工業來和美國競爭？以上的種種問題，到現在還是難以置答的。但是事實存在着，顯然的他不能再回好萊塢久居，卽使他能偶一回去的話。　　島格拉斯並不需要更多的金錢。照一九三三年的估計，他還是好萊塢的第三位富人，在他上面的，不過是却利卓别靈和曼麗璧克福兩個人。有一次人家問他，爲什麽要週遊世界而不從事於工作。他說：「我有的是錢。我工作了一輩子，現在正好遊玩遊玩。」但是譬如他需要的話，他的老公司，全好萊塢，全美國的人，都雙手捧着錢等他來拿哩。那末他爲的是衣服佩的一條紅帶子嗎？誠然，好萊塢所能給與他的光榮，已經統通是他的了。在家早已知道他漸漸的覺得厭倦起來。於是他想着去征服新世界，獵着勳爵貴族，如同獵着珍禽異獸一樣，他常常到外國去游歷一趟，就會帶了幾個有爵位的人回來的。　　過去的三年之中，島格拉斯不過偶然的回到好萊塢休息休息。過了幾天，又出去週遊世界了。起初大家都知道他的跳蕩不覊的脾氣，以爲遊蕩是當然的事，又誰知他將來有一天不回來的呢？他的狂遊，是從一九三零年開始的。那年的春天，他獨自一個人去到歐洲參加一個高爾夫比賽，那就是他第一次離開了曼麗璧克福出門。不久他回到好萊塢，想拍片子，但是也沒有拍成。到了一九三一年的一月，他來到遠東，想拍一張「八十分鐘週遊世界」，但是亦沒有拍成，又到歐洲去了。五月裹他在英國和曼麗相會了，一同回到好萊塢。但是在九月裹他又走了。到了年底，他回到好萊塢度年。但是隔了兩個月，他又出發到南海拍了一張，一魯濱孫飄流記」。一九三二年的五月，他曾回好萊塢一次。在八月他又離開了，並且曾到過中國一次。一九三二年的冬天，島格拉斯還曾經趕回好萊塢度聖誔節，但是到了一九三三年的二月，他又到歐洲作「長途旅行」去了。到了五月他又回好萊塢一次，但是不到幾天，他又到英國去了。在六月十九日，報上登着他在英國草地上，和英國皇太子，喬治皇子，還有一位高爾夫專家，在打高爾夫哩。可是到了七月，就有驚人的消息發生了。（未完）影片談評評「烟花夢回」　　Chance　at　Heaven　　我想人們看過這一影片以後，决不會留有深刻的印象。因爲這過於平常了　　自然，我們並不說它如何要不得，可是在十分平凡的故事中並沒有演出不平凡的戲來。就這一方面說，我們並不反對在電影中採取平凡的故事。反之，假使有了不平凡的故事，而又得着平凡的結果，那末將是何等損失呢？　　瑪姬愛上了白克，白克亦極愛白姬，其後白克又另外愛上了一個富家女郎，而富家女郎果然因一時之情慾而私奔來，富家女終於别嫁郎君，汽車加油站主的白克到底和幼年相愛的瑪姬好合以終，這亦未嘗不是平凡的眞實，但是白克和哥蘭同居期内，寛洪大量的瑪姬却毫不憎恨的而爲哥蘭料理家政，這未免是不十分平凡的事件吧。　　在這裹最値得我們注意的，便是劇作者同時寫三個好人，這三人之中，沒有誰該受人們的指責。所以我們應當研究的，倒還是這三人的個性的描寫。　　白克和瑪姬，自然都是忠於愛情的人。在他們之間早已有了非常愉快而十分自然的情感在互相融洽着。但是他們之間却多少有些不同的性格；白克熱愛而輕浮，而瑪姬却有含蓄的不肯輕易流露情感。例如白克自加油站工作歸來的時候，急欲擁女接吻，而女則出於非常自然的制止他。這表示她們之間的關係已是家常便飯似的爛熟，而又表示她對於愛情極有信心，並不在乎這一吻一抱之間的熱情。　　直至白克和哥蘭實行同居之後，瑪琍爲了完成未婚夫的心願，居然寛大爲懷的讓他們同居。這時她苦惱的心情，作者使她饙贈一塊冰給未婚夫，象徵了她心情的冰冷。然而要她帮助情敵料理家政，到底是誇大其詞的吧。卽使說她準知道哥蘭會與自己之未婚夫離異，卽使她極有理智，然而一個少女如此描摹，到底是不平凡的吧。　　關於白克的個性，由於作者的表現，我們可看出他的理智薄弱，易於動搖自己的主見。於是，她便不假思索的而和哥蘭同居。可是這樣發展下去，當他在紐約失敗歸來的時候，依照他的個性不是要發狂嗎？然而在這裹作者却放過這機會而促成高潮，祇是在蟲聲喞喞的夜深人靜時，讓他走進伊人已去的屋裹而垂頭喪氣。好罷，卽是如此，也未嘗不是給他一個反省的機會，可是作者却急於使他和未婚妻圑圓，而在一聲（Ｇood　everin）聲中未婚妻走進他的懷抱中了。雖然在此更顯出那瑪姬的大方忠情，可是對於男主角却描寫得不够了。　　對於哥蘭這個人物，也許並不是我們經常見面的人，不過一個小姐一時愛上了一個美少年，暫時的熱情，以同居爲兒戲。結果，自然她决定受不了虚榮的誘惑，而離開這曾經相愛的漢子。但是她决不是我們所認爲的壞人，她的行動始終可以得着人們的同情，因爲她確是很熱心的和他相愛。而她爲什麽一定要放棄她自身的利益而和他偕老呢？她的行動是不會和她的自身利益矛盾的。但是作者僅僅在不會燒飯和不善處理家政等方面，到底還嫌不够。　　前面說過，這是平凡的故事平凡的叙述。整個的演出，有如一道輕烟，雖然曾經在我們面前飛過，而不能留着何種痕迹。這主要的是劇中沒有適當的高潮，全般是平平的發展。這種戲對於多數觀衆是不免感覺沈悶的吧。聯華二廠禮聘孫師毅　　在今日國片影界中最感缺乏的當然是劇本。其緣因第一是影片公司對於劇本不能付給編劇家希望的代價：第二有好些影片公司都不用外來劇本；第三我國文壇上的作品適合改編電影的太少。聯華除各導演自編劇本之外，對於外來劇本是比較的時常採用，不過因上述種種緣因使從事文學的人對編劇的興趣很淡薄而劇本的產生很少，更加上未必有則合用，就是不能不感到劇本荒，而在多方物色專材以解决以難題。最近聯華頒佈二十三年度出品計劃，除預告的劇本之外尙需多數，當然非有源源而來的劇本不可。第二廠便在本年度第一次製片會議上提出，結果一致主張禮聘多方屬意而求之不得的戲劇家孫師毅君擔任。聞已徵得孫君同意，欣然樂就卽日到廠視事了。寒冬深夜大雨滂沱暴雨梨花加緊工作　　影片公司拍戲，最怕冬天，不但拍外景不方便，天氣冷而要冒着寒威拍戲，那種味道眞是够人消受的。聯華一廠馬徐維邦編導的「暴雨梨花」，因爲積極進行，這幾天都是連夜工作，前天晚上，拍工廠爆炸一幕，露天搭着佈景，演員都穿着極單薄的衣服，在廣塲中工作，寒氣襲人，大家也只有忍耐着，有時，到燈下得一點點的煖氣，這樣，竟一直拍到天亮，那知道將近天亮時，導演一聲命令，拍爆炸後下雨一幕，立刻，雷電交作，大雨傾盆，演員們挨凍之餘，又遇大雨一個個澆得像落湯雞一般，深冬寒夜大雨淋漓，大家都凍僵了。還有聯華三廠拍「良宵」，大大雪中，談瑛演私奔一幕，來往奔馳，全身都弄濕了，凍得她哭起來，但是，她哭，導演楊小仲却大笑，因爲她的哭已經收入鏡頭了。作演員除了有表演才能，又要有抵抗大自然的能力，眞難乎其爲演員了。費穆「媽然一笑」　　如果有人向費穆問起人生的成績，他總是微微地一笑，如果你再問他：「比城市之夜怎麽樣？」他還是一笑。實在，一個導演對於這類的問題是很難置答的，自吹自擂，果然不好，倘若過分謙遜，那又近乎僞飾，所以費穆的一笑，倒是一個聰明辦法。　　不過，就事實來講，「人生」無論在那方面，都好過「城市之夜」。並且還可以說，「人生」的成績，已突破一切，而躍登了世界的地位。笑的種類很多，費穆那一笑，或者是得意的笑吧？沈西苓傑作「上海廿四小時」不日公映　　沈西苓導演之「上海廿四小時」，自經中央檢查通過後，卽擬公映。惟後因特種關係，一部分復經沈導演改作，較原來者更見精采。現已定於二月中公映矣。現下沈導演正從事其新作「烟」之攝製。電影小說克利斯丁娜Ｑueen　Christina(二)  笏臣　　（續一月二十九日）　　克利斯丁娜從她座位上站了起來。她走到窗口，望着窗外瀰漫地飄着和平的雪，然後她掉轉頭來，勃然的向着首相道：「爲什麽那就是我的天職呢？我的白天，我的黑夜，統通用在國家事務上面了。我一天到晚，爲了職務一些沒有空閒，以至於要看一本書，一定要半夜起身。我爲我的百姓服務，非但盡我的心，竭我的力，我還辛勞我的夢寢，無論是走着或是睡着。我不願意結婚，他們能强迫我的嗎！」首相還堅持道：「陞下必須爲瑞典的後嗣着想。陛下是一國之君，亦是先王的愛女。」克利斯丁娜臉上已露了不耐煩的辭色，她自言自語道：「我們活着是爲死人活的嗎？」首相緊跟着道：「是的，是爲偉大的已往的前輩！」克利斯丁娜暫時先不理他，祇看着窗飄飄的雪片，一望無際。她自言自語道：「這好似茫茫大海，一個人會在其中喪失的。首相還不想走，他繼續着道：「陛下，你難道想丫角終身嗎？」克利斯丁娜聽了暗暗好笑，她回轉頭來，帶着幽默的神氣對着首相道：「不，我是想以魯男子終身哩！」這樣她一揮手，就呌首相走了。　　克利斯丁娜要離開她的辦公室了。可是她一開門，正遇見度支大臣麥格納斯。她知道他是在偷聽他們的談話，所以冷冷地道：「怪不得你這樣信息靈通呢。」麥格納斯笑了。他將他的臂彎了過去摟她的腰。他將他的嘴凑在她的耳朶邊說道：「我好久好久沒有看見你了」。克利斯丁娜雖是露首笑容，可是已經避開他的親近，祇冷靜的看着他道：「不是我們昨天見爾斯，我倒覺得怪失望的。我倒願意你嫁他，比嫁别人好。他一天到晚閱操···不是我們閒空的工夫就多了嗎？···」克利斯丁娜哼了一聲道：「你怎麽可以拿查爾斯開玩笑呢。他是一個愛國男兒，他爲瑞典不惜犧牲他的性命。至少，他總比一個投機家好些。」麥格納斯向她看了一回說道：「你今天一本正經得很。」克利斯丁娜亦對他看着。停了一回，她說道：「我在這裹看着你｜｜好像看着一個不相識的生人｜｜一個不喜歡的生人。」麥格納斯微微地聳了一聳肩膀道：「你怎麽說就怎麽好，祇要你愛我」於是他們兩個人的目光，又相角力了一回。很奇怪的，克利斯丁娜心裹想着，那副眼睛，燃燒着神秘之火｜｜那張嘴，它親切的吻曾經打動過她的芳心···但是···最後她肯定的說道：「麥格納斯，我已經不愛你了，一切的亦都完了。」麥格納斯還挑逗着她道：「你會覺得冷靜的。到了冷靜的時候，你會知道我在等候着你。我是你終身的歸宿。」克利斯丁娜道：「是嗎？那我一定要避免那歸宿的。」她說完了就走開了，而麥格納斯還鞠着躬道：「你一定要回到這歸宿來的。」（未完）</p>

Unless Japan changes its attitude, a huge disaster of bloodshed can hardly be avoided. China and several other countries will be drawn into the vortex. Russia does not really want to fight, but if it is forced to the point of helplessness, Russia will also take care of itself. Japan must now abandon its aggressive attitude in the Far East and stop its improper business methods abroad.

They returned to Turpan from Aksu in early November last year and turned east to Gansu, only arriving in Beijing recently. Before their departure, they had already heard rumors of a plot for independence in Kashi and knew that its leaders were Sabut Damolla and Abuduyamu and several others. Because in August of the previous year, they had contacted the consular officials of a certain country stationed in Kashi to purchase more than a thousand new guns, their brewing had been going on for a long time. Now, it is rumored that Kashi is independent and has sent its puppet Deputy Foreign Minister to Afghanistan and India to conclude friendship treaties. If the causes and consequences are compared, then the claim of independence can be confirmed. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) There is no official report on the independence of southern Xinjiang. According to those familiar with the situation in Xinjiang, the independence claim is quite possible. Since the Hami uprising in the winter of the 20th year of the Republic, due to Jin Shuren's improper handling, the incident expanded. Kashi also rebelled in the summer of the 21st year of the Republic, and many Han Chinese were killed. Since then, it has been isolated from the provincial government and has long been in a state of separation. When Huang Musong and Luo Wengan entered Xinjiang, they both planned to go to southern Xinjiang to offer condolences. The people of southern Xinjiang also greatly hoped for their arrival, but the Sheng-Ma war continued, preventing them from going. Southern Xinjiang has long been in a state of neglect. Now that independence is rumored, it is not without reason. The way to save it is to first stop the war in northern Xinjiang, and then send high officials to appease the people, which is not difficult to quell. Otherwise, it will be unmanageable. The central government has paid attention to this and has decided to send Huang Shaoxiong to Xinjiang. After making some arrangements, he will be in place. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A report stated that Tang Youren said that the news about the independence of southern Xinjiang was inaccurate and that the embassy in Russia telegraphed that there was no such thing, which was actually done by Ma Zhongying. According to Tang, he himself has not met any reporters and has never made such remarks to anyone, nor has he seen any telegram from the embassy in Russia. He takes no responsibility for this record.

<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian petition representatives, because the central government has scheduled to submit the Mongolian autonomy plan to the Political Council for review next Wednesday, specifically suggested to the Political Council that it should try its best to adopt the opinions of the Mongolian people before the case is reviewed and that the Mongolian petition representatives should be allowed to send representatives to attend the review and state the true intentions of the Mongolian people. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Inner Mongolian petition representatives received a telegram from the leaders of the Silingol League and Xilin Gol League, stating that the Kwantung Army headquarters has recently sent special commissioners to carry wireless equipment to the Leagues to communicate news, intending to use political tactics to invade Inner Mongolia and complete their dream of a Manchuria-Mongolia plan. The leaders of the Silingol League have politely declined. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Bailingmiao said: (1) After the presidium of the Inner Mongolian Autonomy Conference received the Inner Mongolian autonomy plan passed by the Central Political Council on January 17, there was a great uproar. Then, Prince De drafted two telegrams, which were signed and translated by Prince Yun and others and sent out. One telegram questioned Huang Shaoxiong about the process of overturning the original agreement, and the other was addressed to various ministries and departments of the central government, stating the reasons for not accepting the resolution of the Central Political Council on January 17. (2) After the two telegrams were sent out, the presidium re-deliberated on the second step of measures. It was decided that if the central government did not have concrete measures to help the Mongolian people develop, they would jointly send a telegram stating that they would not stop until the original agreement was achieved. (3) According to a certain important member of the Mongolian Autonomy Conference's presidium, in the event that the central government never made further assistance plans for Mongolian autonomy, it would only be possible to recall the representatives stationed in Beijing, the students studying in Beijing, and fellow villagers in Beijing, concentrate talent, and govern all Mongolian issues under the guidance of the central government. (4) Regarding Puyi's usurpation of the title of emperor, the Mongolian people did not feel any interest, and those with clear minds have already felt that western Mongolia will definitely be infringed upon in the future. For this reason, in recent months, various Leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia have repeatedly deliberated on coping measures and at the same time hoped that the central government would consider the border areas and seek an early solution to the autonomy issue.

One part advanced to Cixian, but was met and besieged by He Zhuguo's army in the Nanwangzhuang area. The bandits are still resisting stubbornly on the 2nd. Huang's division of the merchants' army engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits in Pengcheng Town. The bandits have lost their stronghold, and the artillery is carrying out a general offensive.

<p>The Number Has Reached Over Three Thousand</p>
<p>Provincial Government Prepares to Take Action</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng Arrives in Jixian for Inspection</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong said that Hu Xie of Yutian entrusted Li, the chief of staff of the 51st Army, to bring a letter today, blaming the mutiny of the team on the fact that the bandit groups attacked for no reason, and they had no choice but to resist. At the end, he complained that after the team was reorganized, only 11,000 yuan was allocated each month, and the salaries were in arrears for several months. The soldiers could not maintain themselves and temporarily borrowed money from local sources. The local gentry referred to this as extortion and attacked the provincial government, causing the whole team to become angry. Now the whole team has retreated to the city and is listening to the reorganization, hoping to issue the arrears as soon as possible, etc. Since the reorganization of Hu Xie's unit in Yutian, the number of people is the same as that of Li Jichun's unit, one thousand people per team, and the salary is 11,000 yuan. The provincial government treats the unit the same as the security teams in other war zones. How could it be discriminatory? Now, the team is making excuses that bandit groups are invading and the local gentry are provoking troubles, and expanding their troops at will, and then demanding to be increased. The provincial government will never allow this to set a precedent. Yin Rugeng has gone to Beiping to ask the Military Council and the Political Committee for instructions. The provincial government has decided on a solution for the aftermath of Hu's unit, and the Political Committee and the Military Committee have also agreed, but because the area is in a war zone, in case of accidents, it involves diplomatic issues, so the two political and military committees must carefully prepare a strategy. Hu Xie sent personnel to control the Yutian Post and Telegraph Bureau, and all military, financial and political affairs in the county were decided and implemented by Peng Zuyou and Hu Xie. County magistrate Dong Tianhua moved to a store, and the government orders could not be implemented. It is heard that when Peng Zuyou arrived in Yutian, he showed Hu Xie, Zhang Futian, and Feng Shouchun a letter personally written by Shi Yousan, saying that Shi ordered them to lead the unit. The general idea of ​​the letter also urged Hu and Zhang to support Peng as the leader. Yu Xuezhong wrote a special letter to Shi Yousan to ask if he was helping to create chaos in Yutian. If not, he should quickly write to Peng Zuyou and ask him to leave the team so that the provincial government could deal with it. The police guns of the Yutian Public Security Bureau were confiscated by the mutinying troops on the 31st. At the moment, the mutinying troops are still recruiting bandits and expanding their forces as much as possible, and the number of people is over 3,000. The people in the nearby counties of Jiqianfeng are all panicked. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e20">Britain's Mediation of the European Stagnation Requires Caution <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>｜Germany's Demand for Military Equality: A Plan for Negotiation｜</p>
<p>The policy adopted by Great Britain on the issue of arms reduction has recently been publicly announced, and a memorandum has been sent to the United States, Germany, Italy, France, Japan, Belgium, Poland, and other countries. The content of the memorandum can be roughly divided into the following two points: (1) To eliminate weapons of an offensive nature or reduce weapons of an offensive nature. (2) To promote the elimination of the trial period under the administration of German military preparations by various countries and to recognize Germany's demand for military equality. If this proposal can gain the sympathy of Italy and the support of the United States, then France, no matter how firmly it insists, will have to consider making concessions.</p>
<p>At a time when the European stalemate is difficult to break and Germany and France remain opposed to each other, Great Britain has put forward the proposition of supporting Germany's demand for military equality. Is it truly for the sake of the future of European peace and a desire to overcome the current crisis by this means? Or is it using this to stabilize the situation of the British Empire? Although this has a considerable and realistic connection with the current situation in Great Britain, it is not the fundamental intention of British diplomacy. Great Britain has not yet definitively abandoned its consistent policy of supporting two strong countries in Europe.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in continental Europe, in terms of land military strength, no country can be an enemy of France. Not to mention Germany, which has no military strength. Even Italy, which can barely compete with France, can only unite the Central European countries, or win over Germany to contain France, or use the power of the Soviet Union to seek diplomatic application. In this situation, Great Britain is well aware that the result of the excessive expansion of French power is that the pound sterling will have no foothold in Europe. Therefore, it has no choice but to be friendly with Italy, implying an attitude towards France. At the same time, regarding the issue of German military preparations, Great Britain and France have different opinions. The reason for their difference is not only the difference in legal opinions. If Germany can break through the current situation and partially revise the Treaty of Versailles, then the position of Great Britain will undoubtedly be more favorable diplomatically and economically than it is today. In particular, opening up the stalemate in arms reduction is especially important for Great Britain.</p>
<p>Today's global arms race is not just about land forces, and it is not just limited to continental Europe. The navy and air force are also major goals of the arms race. The so-called issue of military equality is indeed the most serious issue at the moment. However, the British authorities are experienced in diplomacy and good at calculation. They know very well that modern military preparations, whether land, sea, or air, are all tending towards technicalization and mechanization. To make military preparations that are practical, technical, and mechanized, the three factors of a population well-trained in science, sufficient economic strength, and abundant natural resources within the country must be present to be effective. Although Germany now holds up the high banner of demanding military equality and insists on abolishing the Treaty of Versailles, its actual capabilities are quite weak. The inadequacy of its domestic economic strength, the limitation of its natural resources, and the narrowness of its overseas markets are all natural conditions and environmental relationships that make it difficult for Germany to expand its military preparations. Even if it obtains the right to military equality, it will not be able to stand on an equal footing with France in practice. If France can truly boldly admit to revising the Treaty of Versailles and allow Germany military equality, while still maintaining the status quo in Europe, then what Germany gains will only be more convenient diplomatically, and Poland and the small countries in the Danube River basin will tend more towards France, which will be even more beneficial to Great Britain and France.</p>
<p>As for the so-called eliminating offensive weapons or reducing offensive weapons, it is quite difficult to seek a consensus and fair point among various countries on these specialized definitions. In past arms reduction conferences, this was repeatedly discussed, but there was no result. It is difficult to predict at this moment whether it will follow the same path in the future. However, judging the future based on past experience and the current situation, I am afraid that there are more pessimistic elements and fewer optimistic conclusions. What is the reason for this? It is because current international relations mostly tend towards national development. The so-called economic alliances, the so-called self-sufficiency, the so-called tariff wars, currency wars, etc., are all happening. Economically, they are rushing madly towards nationalistic economic organizations, attempting to monopolize the expansion of power. Politically, they are based on military relations, such as submarines, airplanes, light cruisers, infantry guns, and tanks. It is not easy to determine whether these are offensive weapons or defensive weapons. In short, any weapon mostly has both offensive and defensive capabilities at the same time. Under the current circumstances, A is right and B is wrong, each with its own reasons. It is ultimately not easy to reach an appropriate conclusion in the international community. Therefore, Great Britain's mediation of the European situation will probably only be able to alleviate the situation to a limited extent.</p>

<p>The Accident Occurred at 4:10 PM on Tuesday</p>
<p>The Balloon Compartment Broke Off and Touched Ground at 4:23 PM</p>
<p>It Had Risen to an Altitude of 22,000 Meters</p>
<p>It Continued to Record Even During the Sudden Descent</p>
<p>(Moscow) The special committee investigating the details of the accident of the Soviet Russian stratosphere balloon "Sirihes" today released a report stating that the three aeronauts continued to record as they ascended into the stratosphere, even during the beginning of the sharp descent to the ground. Although many of the delicate scientific instruments in the balloon were shattered, the tape recording the pressure instruments inside the balloon chamber remained intact, indicating that the balloon reached its maximum height at 12:33 PM on Tuesday. As for the cause of the accident, it was found that the descent began at 12:45 PM, and the descent became faster and faster. By 4:10 PM, at an altitude of 12,000 meters, the rate of descent was alarming. The sudden acceleration caused part of the rope holding the balloon chamber to break, and the aluminum chamber tilted and separated from the balloon. It touched the ground at 4:23 PM and was destroyed with great force. The committee determined that the last recording was at 4:10 PM and now recognizes this as the starting point of the disaster. All previous recordings are sufficient to prove that the three aeronauts were in high spirits and excited about the success of the ascent. (National News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to the results of the examination, the reason for the accident of the Soviet Russian stratosphere exploration balloon "Sirius" was caused by the icing outside the balloon chamber and on the ropes. Because the balloon had risen into the atmosphere where the air was violently shaken, the balloon swayed up and down, and the ropes had iced, which caused them to break into small pieces, and the balloon fell. (National News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The "Sirihes" stratosphere balloon recorded that the balloon had risen to a height of 22,000 meters, which is 1,400 meters higher than previously announced and 3,000 meters higher than the height reached by the first Soviet Russian stratosphere balloon.

<p>London Eagerly Awaits Responses from Various Countries</p>
<p>Will the Gap Between France and Germany Widen?</p>
<p>The Key to the Future Lies in French Concessions</p>
<p>(London) London is now eagerly awaiting prompt responses from France, Germany, and other countries to the British memorandum, and hopes that their second thoughts can change the informal reactions. Judging from the informal reactions, the gap between France and Germany will widen. British officials acknowledge that France must make major concessions, but it can also obtain valuable rewards, namely, first, Germany's return to the League of Nations, and second, Germany's acceptance of permanent automatic inspections on military preparations.</p>
<p>French newspapers are almost unanimously opposed. The Labor newspaper's headline reads, "Simultaneous Attack from London and Rome." The Paris Echo newspaper does not even approve of the compromise, saying that the compromise gives unfair preferential treatment to those who demand too much.</p>
<p>Italian newspapers believe that the simultaneous publication of the British and Italian memorandums is proof that the two governments agreed on it in advance. A Washington dispatch states that the British memorandum and President Roosevelt's gold announcement are viewed as equally important in official circles.</p>
<p>A semi-official document from Berlin is quite pleased with the British and Italian memorandums' recognition of Germany's demand for equality, and therefore believes that this is a major and valuable contribution to European peace.

<h3 id="e43">French Arms Reduction Note <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Gentle Wording with No Surprises</p>
<p>Still Difficult for Germany and France to Approach Each Other</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government's memorandum answering Germany's arms reduction construction of a month ago was released today. The content of the document is indeed as expected outside when it was sent to Berlin and has no surprises. Its wording is very gentle, expressing the French government's intention to strive for reconciliation, and its nature is to seek new ways so that the arms reduction conference can be reopened. France does not allow Germany's standing army to exceed 200,000 people (Germany believes that 200,000 people is not enough to guarantee its security). France is willing to reduce 50% of its air force strength, but the demobilized parts are still retained for future international air force use (Germany believes that if Germany is not allowed to equip an air force, then France's proposal is worthless). France is willing to put forward formal suggestions in Geneva (Germany is willing to negotiate directly because it has no intention of returning to the "Capital of Peace"). France has put forward suggestions for a trial period of arms reduction (Germany believes that this is a discriminatory move against Germany). France suggests that international supervision should be imposed on German paramilitary organizations (Germany insists that any supervision imposed on Germany should also be imposed on other countries). The full text of the memorandum is fifteen pages long. Germany has carefully studied it in the middle of last month. The general opinion is that this document cannot bring the positions of Germany and France closer. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) On January 1st of this year, French Ambassador to Germany Ponset handed over the French government's arms reduction memorandum to German Chancellor Hitler. Its content was not released until today. The main points are as follows: The memorandum first raises reservations about the reasons on which Germany's demands are based, especially regarding Germany's rearmament.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Non-Aggression Treaty <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Secondly, it expressed satisfaction with Germany's intention to conclude non-aggression treaties with its neighboring countries, but stated that non-aggression treaties can only be established if they do not harm the scope of security guarantees stipulated in existing treaties. Among the existing treaties, the Locarno Treaty is especially important, and non-aggression treaties must add other new guarantees to it so that the contracting countries can maintain their independence and are not subject to external threats, and their internal affairs are not subject to foreign interference."</p>
<h3 id="e45">Military Inspection System <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Then it stated that since Germany has already approved</p>
<p>In principle, the system of on-site, on-time, automatic military inspection, it is not known whether it can accept the implementation methods proposed during the last few discussions of the arms reduction conference. Other parties are likely to agree on this level. The memorandum also stated that the arms reduction conference has clearly indicated its goals up to now, and Germany has no objection. Now Germany's proposal to substantially rearm is contrary to this goal. The reason why Germany's plan to substantially rearm cannot be implemented immediately is only limited by the financial situation.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Troop Size and Military Equipment <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Although the troop size demanded by Germany is 300,000 people,</p>
<p>In addition to this number, there are still a large number of police, whose military nature has been recognized by the arms reduction conference, and there are also military education organizations outside the formal army. No draft convention has calculated these organizations as troop quotas. Therefore, the name is 300,000 people, but it is unknown how many there are in reality. It is too unfair to compare this with other countries. Regarding the issue of military equipment, the memorandum stated that Germany's demand to immediately rearm in terms of quantity and quality is, in fact, if it is to be implemented fairly, it is necessary to first plan the standardization of the military systems of various countries, and the unification of military systems cannot be achieved without several years of effort. Germany also acknowledges this level. As for the military inspection system, although Germany has approved it in principle, it has raised reservations about the implementation period. It is unknown whether the future arms reduction convention can be effectively implemented, and it all depends on whether the inspection system can be accurately used. Moreover, the demands proposed by Germany are no different from a complete plan for rearmament. If this plan is approved by the future arms reduction convention, what is the difference from reopening the door to the arms race?</p>
<h3 id="e47">Phased Disarmament System <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>On the French side, it is prepared to accept another plan, namely, to revise the British arms reduction proposal according to the unstable situation of European politics and the necessary conditions for implementation, so as to achieve phased restrictions on military preparations and fully realize the principle of equality. France intends to reduce the number of French troops in the first few years of the arms reduction convention, referring to the conscription system adopted by the German National Defense Forces, in the hope of making the military organization of the two countries consistent. France also recognizes that all military equipment is limited to the existing level and will not be increased. France is also willing to stop manufacturing any military equipment with a caliber exceeding the limits permitted by the convention. This is called the first phase. Also, within this period, the military inspection system must be adjusted, and it applies to the number of troops and the manufacture and import of military equipment in various countries. After this, all military equipment that exceeds the limit in quality will be gradually abolished, and countries that are currently restricted by peace treaties will also gradually be allowed to equip them. France is willing to specify the numbers for the above points and include them in the arms reduction convention. However, in order to seek practical results when discussing this issue, the countries concerned should consult together. This is called the second phase.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Air Force Reduced by 50% <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>In order for France to show the importance of the second phase of disarmament to Germany, it has specially cited several examples in the memorandum to cover the rest. For example, the caliber of active guns can be reduced by France to 155 meters, which is the caliber allowed by the future convention. In addition, France plans to reduce 50% of its existing air force equipment within a few years of the start of the arms reduction convention, provided that the air forces of major countries are reduced as many as possible, and effective supervision is implemented on the establishment and manufacture of civil aviation.</p>
<h3 id="e49">International Air Force System <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The memorandum also stated that the military aviation of all countries should be abolished in full and replaced by an international air force. France is preparing to reduce military preparations on a large scale, so it can be seen that this is the opposite of what Germany said. However, it still relies on Germany's cooperation. The memorandum also explained that France has no intention of closing the door to current negotiations. The French government is pleased that the German government has stated that Chancellor Hitler is prepared to resolve any future disputes between the two countries in a friendly manner at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e50">No Territorial Disputes <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>While there are no territorial disputes between France and Germany, most current issues are European in nature. Without the involvement of all related countries and the League of Nations, there is little hope for resolution, as can be seen in the opinions expressed by Prime Minister Hitler. The memorandum concludes by stating that all issues can be resolved through mutual understanding. Germany's withdrawal from Geneva is not only detrimental to Germany itself but also hinders international cooperation. It is strongly urged that Germany continue to cooperate with all nations within the scope of policies most conducive to international cooperation, which refers to the League of Nations.

<p>Rome Expresses Satisfaction</p>
<p>The United States Remains Noncommittal</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons is scheduled to debate the British disarmament memorandum on the 6th of this month. France has expressed some criticism of the memorandum, but Rome is satisfied because the views of Britain and Italy are aligned. It is reported that Italy will likely accept most of the British proposals, but it cannot agree to the abolition of the preliminary military training system in Italy. Furthermore, because the scope of the British proposals is broader than Italy's, there is considerable doubt as to whether it can be accepted by everyone with satisfaction. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Under Secretary of State Phillips told the press that both Britain and Italy have expressed their views on the German armament issue. The State Department is unwilling to comment on the situation in Europe resulting from this. Britain has notified the State Department of the content of the memorandum, but the United States does not need to respond. (Havas News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) One section of the British memorandum to the related countries on the issue of disarmament states that Germany's return to the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference is a major condition for the establishment of a disarmament convention. Well-informed sources here criticize this passage, saying that while Germany's return to Geneva is desirable, it cannot be designated as an indispensable condition. However, the purpose of the British memorandum's concessions to Germany is to make Germany feel satisfied with the principle of equality in armaments. British officials believe that if this is done, Germany can return to Geneva. Political figures believe that the British memorandum can serve as the basis for future negotiations, regardless of whether they are a conference of major powers, a disarmament conference, or talks between countries through normal diplomatic channels, there is no reason why the British proposal cannot be used as a basis. As for the plan released by Italy, it is merely a brief explanation of the matters proposed by the Italian Prime Minister in Rome with British Foreign Secretary Simon. People here are quite silent about it. As for the new proposals put forward by the British Foreign Office, British public opinion generally agrees with them. From the perspective of the extreme right-wing in Britain, their support is because they believe that Britain's mediation this time is the last attempt. If it fails again, Britain can regain its freedom of action. (Havas News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Berliner Tageblatt commented on the British memorandum and the disarmament plan released by Italy, saying that the intentions of Britain and Italy may be to prevent the interruption of disarmament negotiations. If France and Germany cannot reach an agreement through separate negotiations, France is eager to move the discussion of disarmament back to Geneva. The newspaper also said that the actions of Britain and Italy are indeed satisfactory because the disarmament negotiations will continue without interruption. The Politisch-Diplomatische Korrespondenz compared the optimistic attitude of Britain with the practical mentality of Italy. Britain still hopes to engage in disarmament on a small scale, while Italy regards the unwillingness of some countries to disarm as a difficult problem to solve and believes that this matter cannot be ignored.

<p>Entire Austrian Government Dissatisfied</p>
<p>Still a Tendency to Appeal to the League of Nations</p>
<p>Crackdown on National Socialist Party Becomes More Severe</p>
<p>Vienna Austria now has an increasing tendency to submit its dispute with Germany to Geneva. If so, the League of Nations will face another extremely important problem after China applied to stop Japan's aggression in the three northeastern provinces. Austria previously protested against the activities of the German National Socialist Party in Austria. Although Germany has replied, the Austrian government considers this reply unsatisfactory. Therefore, there is still talk today that the Austrian government will continue to move forward along the path it is being driven into by the environment. This probably means that Austria will take severe measures to deal with the National Socialist Party within Austria on the one hand, and appeal to the League of Nations on the other. Austria's protest to Germany accused Germany of importing bomb materials into Austria, Germans attempting to incite internal chaos in Austria to overthrow the government, and issuing radio and other propaganda unfavorable to Austrian security. After receiving this document, Germany gave a firm reply, stating that the German government's basic attitude towards the Austrian problem has been determined, and refuting Austria's accusations one by one, saying that there was no such thing, and expressing the opinion that this problem is not an international matter and cannot be resolved through international handling. The reply was quite long, and its wording and intent have aroused the dissatisfaction of the entire Austrian government. Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Fey was given almost unlimited power to crack down on the activities of the National Socialist Party in Austria, and was given the power to replace provincial governors, police chiefs, and other senior officials. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Zurich, Switzerland According to news from Austria regarding the situation in Tyrol Province, the Patriotic League arrested more than 400 political prisoners in Innsbruck, many of whom are intellectuals who believe in Hitler, including a former university president, several professors, a retired Gendarmerie Major, and a former Innsbruck city police officer. At the same time, 8,000 members of the Patriotic League were incorporated into the regular army, equipped with 100 machine guns, sufficient to restore order in the entire province. It is reported that the Patriotic League intends to control the provincial government and fill the position of provincial governor with a member of the League. The candidate for provincial governor is said to be Count Enzenberg, who succeeded Stettner (one of the leaders of the Patriotic League, assassinated by an enemy party last year) as Director of Public Security.

<p>(Washington) Political and diplomatic figures are paying close attention to the increasingly tense international situation in Europe and the Far East, and their concerns are growing day by day. When the House of Representatives recently discussed the plan to build 102 naval vessels and increase the air force, some people explicitly stated that if there is an armed conflict in the Far East, the United States may not be able to remain aloof. After the U.S. House of Representatives just passed the naval plan, the Japanese House of Peers immediately discussed the naval ratio between Japan and the United States, which shocked members of Congress again. Some people now expect that the Senate will expand the plan passed by the House of Representatives. (Havas News Agency, 2nd)</p>

<p>Miyakoshi Criticizes the Military's Interference in Politics, Leaving the System in Tatters</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives Budget General Meeting reopened at 1:50 PM today, starting with questions from Ikeda Hideo (Minseito Party):</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>Now that "Manchukuo" has realized its constitutional monarchy, Japan should strengthen its agencies in Manchuria to match the name and reality. The current "three-in-one" system is only a temporary measure for personnel relations and government actions. Is there any intention to change it in the future?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Saito Answer:</p>
<p>The current "three-in-one" system is indeed temporary, but the time for its immediate change has not yet arrived.</p>
<p>Ikeda Asked:</p>
<p>It has been repeatedly heard that there is a saying to transfer the railway affiliated land of South Manchuria Railway to "Manchukuo." I think it is not a matter that can be transferred. What is the view of the authorities?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Saito Answer:</p>
<p>The issue has not yet occurred within the government, but I also share the same feeling as you.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) House of Representatives member Miyakoshi Nagakichi fiercely attacked the military department in the lower house this afternoon, and his questions were as follows:</p>
<p>Miyakoshi Asked, "What preparations does the Navy have for the Second Naval Conference in 1935?" The Minister of the Navy Answered, "It is inconvenient to answer in detail, but we must maintain a force that is sufficient to defend ourselves but not enough to attack." Miyakoshi "Soldiers must not interfere in politics. The Meiji Emperor's edict is very clear. The evils of military leaders holding power did not start today. Soldiers, taking advantage of the momentum of victory, often like to interfere in politics. If the country's future is unimaginable." The Minister of the Army Answered, "Soldiers do not interfere in politics because of victory, but politics and the military should be separated." Miyakoshi "Soldiers discussing rural issues, or military officers drafting rural reform plans, is like children playing with fire, because it is not their specialty." Minister of the Army Hayashi "The military department did not have military officers draft plans." Miyakoshi "How about issuing a document clearly ordering soldiers not to discuss politics?" Minister of the Navy "Order the Education Bureau to prepare this matter, and it will be implemented soon." Miyakoshi "Former Minister of the Army Araki's participation in internal affairs meetings easily leads the people to mistakenly believe that soldiers are participating in politics. Please the military ministers be self-respecting in the future." (China United Press, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The replies of Minister of the Army Hayashi in this Diet session have attracted much attention from all parties because his wording is straightforward and full of sincerity. At the budget general meeting on the 1st, Hatta Sokichi of the Seiyukai Party first mentioned the problem of separation between the military and the people and asked Minister Hayashi to answer. The following is an excerpt from the Diet's verbatim record, summarizing the main points of the Minister's reply as follows:</p>
<p>Today's world situation is said to be an extraordinary period, and the stimulation it receives is unprecedented. During the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, we also had a full taste of it, but the mental stimulation received by soldiers at that time is worlds apart compared to today. Although Japan's national polity has not yet been shaken, communist ideas are infiltrating it with extraordinary momentum, which can be said to be an extreme stimulation. From this perspective, the concern for the world is unusually fierce, which is the situation today. Therefore, the spray of his anger flies to the government. Therefore, we should not abandon the root and seek the branch in suppressing his thoughts. The dignity of military discipline should be maintained, but on the one hand, we should also study measures to deal with the current world situation. What should be stopped should be stopped, and we must not only stop what can be stopped. Military discipline is by no means an easy task, but the military department has not deliberately targeted political parties and fought with them, and there is no such intention. In the current situation, both the military and the people should cooperate to overcome the difficulties. In the future, we should strive to control military affairs, and at the same time, we also hope that you will make full efforts from the political standpoint. (Japan United Press, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The House of Peers plenary session opened at 10:20 AM, and the chairman first reported on the ratio bill, which was approved after being separated. Next, Tsumura Jugo took the podium to ask questions, saying:</p>
<p>The government should expand diplomatic agencies and declare that Japan has no ambition for the independence of "Manchukuo." Why did popular figures such as Minister of the Army Araki resign only because of a cold? The South Manchuria Railway reorganization plan was suddenly announced by the military department when the Ministry of Colonial Affairs was unaware of it. This is disrupting the economic community. Regarding economic issues, is it appropriate for the military department to join in? Please Minister of the Army Hayashi answer. As for the iron and steel union, it is appropriate in terms of industrial control, but it seems that it is not appropriate in practice. State-run iron and steel plants, which have suffered huge losses, are marked with extra-legal low prices, while commercially-run companies are highly valued. The government must consider this matter carefully.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Saito Answered:</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Araki's resignation was entirely due to health reasons, and there were no other reasons.</p>
<p>Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai Answered:</p>
<p>The South Manchuria Railway reorganization plan proposed by the Kwantung Army was based on local experiments, so it is very valuable for reference.</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Hayashi Replied:</p>
<p>Regarding the Manchuria problem, I share the same feeling as the Minister of Colonial Affairs. Regarding Manchuria, there is no oppression of businessmen entering or leaving. (Japan United Press, 2nd)</p>

<p>Nationalism is Rampant, Violating the Spirit of Universal Love</p>
<p>The Strong Bullying the Weak, the Majority Abusing the Minority, and the Love of War Are Deeply Rooted in People's Hearts</p>
<p>(Paris) A special correspondent for the French newspaper L'Intransigeant met with the Pope today. The Pope spoke of the approaching catastrophe, which is frightening, not only bringing disaster to Europe but also endangering the entire world, and even threatening the destruction of Christian civilization. The Pope opposed militarism, and the physical training of young women is particularly inappropriate. The Pope criticized excessive nationalism, saying that exerting all efforts to seek the prosperity of one's own country will ultimately subject weak countries to strong countries, which is a violation of the spirit of supporting small countries and Christian universal love. What is urgently needed today is not superficial peace but peace that is deeply rooted in people's hearts. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) In order to make up for the lack of kerosene, the Tokyo Army Automobile School has been actively researching fuels to replace kerosene for years. Recently, it has invented the gasification of water charcoal and uses this charcoal gas instead of kerosene to run the engine. The school has tested it on military vehicles, and the results are quite good, and the cost can be saved by 20% compared to kerosene. In this year's budget for national fuel policy of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, a special appropriation was made to enable the school to manufacture charcoal gas vehicles, with a subsidy of 300 yen per vehicle, and it is planned to continue the subsidy for five years. On the other hand, further research will be carried out to encourage capitalists to manufacture this type of vehicle on a large scale for transportation and national defense.

<p>(London) Before leaving here for the United States, Lord Marley, chairman of the Rescue Committee for Victims of German Fascism, told a reporter from Pravda that he wanted to report the horrors of German Fascism and the war crisis in the Far East to New York, Chicago, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and other American cities. Marley strongly stated that he believed the world was directly threatened by the war launched by Japan. Japanese warlords are trying to engulf the entire territory of China and plan to launch a military offensive against the Soviet Union. Marley believes that British figures in the Far East agree with the idea of ​​being led by Japan. Marley further pointed out that the Chinese people are the most enthusiastic sympathizers of the Soviet Union. He was always able to observe this during his stay in China. The Japanese warlords' attack on the Soviet Union cannot be successful, because the Soviet Union is strong, and at the same time, the Chinese people will ultimately help the Soviet Union.

<p>Expanding Credit to Stabilize Market Prices</p>
<p>Developing American Foreign Trade</p>
<p>Appointing Experts to Assist in the Management of Funds</p>
<p>Establishing Lending Institutions to Promote Commerce</p>
<p>(Washington) The US House of Representatives today unanimously passed a bill to appoint ten exchange experts to assist Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau in managing the exchange fund. President Roosevelt's reduction of the value of the US dollar to 59.06 cents has no immediate impact on various industries in the country, but the authorities have great hopes for this move: (1) expanding credit, (2) stabilizing market prices, and (3) protecting American foreign markets. At present, the French exchange rate has fallen. According to the current fixed exchange rate in the United States, it is enough to make the cash of the National Bank of France gradually flow out of the country. The United States is now engaged in foreign exchange transactions, but the outside world does not understand it very well. According to general observations, the new monetary system in the United States is a disguised "gold standard." The United States maintains its gold value at 59.06 cents and pays all international debts in cash at the fixed price in the United States. Therefore, the purpose of devaluing the US dollar is to promote the gradual stabilization of currencies in various countries. At present, France, the Netherlands, Poland, Belgium, Switzerland, and the United States all have new gold standards. Italy is making every effort to adjust its currency and also has the potential to restore the gold standard. (National News Agency, 1st)</p>

<p>The Netherlands Decides to Maintain the Gold Standard</p>
<p>Japanese Gold Tends to Flow into Manchuria</p>
<p>(New York) The pound sterling was able to resist all kinds of attacks, both real and imagined, today without being shaken at all. The foreign exchange market is chaotic, but the pound sterling remains stable. The US dollar has not fallen in value compared to gold coins, and a considerable difference in cash is still required for London and French francs, so private imports of gold can be quite profitable. The stock exchange traded 4.6 million shares, which is unprecedented since 1933. The market conditions for government bonds and goods are both stable and firm. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Amsterdam People here believe that the temporary stability of the US dollar is a sign that currencies are gradually returning to their new stable position. It is reported that the Dutch bank does not want to change its gold policy and will continue to ensure that there is no shortage of gold when the exchange rate requires gold. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the deliberations by the Suio-Kai, a gold production industry group, on countermeasures against the devaluation of the US dollar, the city has already seen sales of gold at 12.20 yen per ryo (unit) and purchases at 11.65 yen due to the devaluation of the US dollar. As a result, gold production stocks skyrocketed, and the gold market also showed a firm trend. The gold purchase price of the Central Bank of "Manchukuo" is 2.95 Manchukuo yuan per gram, which translates to 11.052 Manchukuo yuan per ryo. When converted to Japanese yen, it is 12.152 yen per ryo, which is much higher than the Ministry of Finance's purchase price of 9.90 yen, and there is a gradual tendency to secretly import gold into "Manchukuo". In view of this, the conclusion was reached that the Ministry of Finance must decisively increase the price of gold, so it was decided to request the Ministry of Finance to do so.

<p>(Paris) There are rumors that France is currently considering temporarily banning the export of gold, but people here do not believe it at all. It is said that the French government's policy is still to maintain the gold standard. At the same time, those who withdraw gold from the Bank of France and transfer it to London and New York are still continuing without interruption. According to financial circles, it is estimated that a total of 500 million francs were withdrawn yesterday. However, the Bank of France's gold reserves still have as much as 7.7 trillion. It is generally believed that the demand for the US dollar will not last long, and that increasing the bank interest rate to increase the cost of purchasing gold will be the first protection plan, which is undoubtedly the case.

Officials admit that if France bans the export of gold, President Roosevelt's policy will be hindered. The foreign reaction to the new US dollar is not very satisfactory in the eyes of Americans.

At the request of the Treasury Secretary, the House Appropriations Committee has approved the hiring of ten experts to assist in the use of the equalization fund for the purchase of gold.

<p>Decided to Take a Vigilant Attitude Toward England</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the upcoming opening of British-Japanese consultations in London, the Japanese government decided to convene a Japanese government and people's consultation meeting on the 2nd to determine the fundamental strategy. The people's representatives attending this meeting, given the disastrous defeat of Japan in the Japanese-Indian consultations, are determined to take a tough stance against the British side. The internally determined strategy is roughly as follows: (1) Japan completely lost the Japanese-Indian consultations. In view of the results, Japanese representatives should pay the utmost attention and vigilance to the British-Japanese consultations. (2) Taking the anti-British strategy decided by the Tokyo government and people's consultation meeting in April of last year as the center, consider the new situation after the establishment of the Japanese-Indian agreement and establish a strategy for the British-Japanese conference. (3) It seems that Britain advocates for a quantity agreement or price agreement based on the number of years before Japan banned gold exports in 1931, but Japan resolutely rejects it and demands that the quantity be based on the large export quantity in 1933. (4) Oppose agreements in third-country markets. (5) Market agreements in British colonies with tariff autonomy are not subjects of discussion. (Japan United Press, 2nd)</p>

However, on the other hand, the Turkish Foreign Minister is quite dissatisfied with the conditions proposed by Romania, which were transmitted from the Romanian capital yesterday.

<p>Sun Army's Withdrawal from Suiyuan Completed</p>
<p>Jin Yan Qiu Expresses Willingness to Mediate</p>
<p>Sun Telegraphs Beiping Requesting Supervision of Troop Withdrawal</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Regarding the war between the Sun and Ma armies, no telegrams have arrived in Beiping from Ningxia in the past two days, so the true situation of the war is still difficult to understand. However, according to related sources, the Sun army is still continuing to attack the Ningxia provincial capital. The two sides are in a standoff at Zhujiazhai and the Greater and Lesser Mosques outside Ningxia City, and fierce battles occur from time to time. Ma Hongkui's troops have joined forces with Zhu Shaoliang's troops to meet the attack. The rumor that Ningxia has been captured by Liu Yueting's troops of the Sun army has yet to be confirmed. Sun Dianying himself is currently commanding military affairs in Dengkou. The troops left behind in Suiyuan have completed their withdrawal. Wang Jingguo's 70th Division of the Jin army telegraphed from Suiyuan today that they have taken over the defense of Linhe. For the sake of the overall situation in the Northwest, the Central Government, in addition to relieving Sun of his concurrent position as the Commissioner of Northwest Reclamation, has also decided on measures to handle the situation and telegraphed the Beiping military authorities to be responsible for handling it. He Yingqin, on behalf of the Chairman, previously telegraphed Sun Dianying, strictly ordering him to withdraw his troops to the area north of Dengkou and earnestly reduce their size. So far, no reply telegram has arrived in Beiping. Sun's attitude is still difficult to predict. If Sun continues to defy orders, then the only option is to take the final measure and handle it according to the Central Government's plan. According to reliable sources, the Sun army's attack on the Ningxia troops has reached its destination after days of fierce fighting. It is heard that the Central Government has decided to issue a clear order to suppress them, which may be issued within a week. At present, Beiping has telegraphed Yan Xishan to seek his consent. If the Jin side expresses its agreement, then the problem will naturally be easily resolved. At that time, the allied forces of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, as well as the Jin and Sui armies, can jointly attack and encircle them, and it will not be difficult for the Sun army to submit. Otherwise, Jin and Sui will temporarily take a supervisory attitude, and Beiping will still be responsible for handling it. Hou Cheng, who was ordered by He Yingqin to go to Taiyuan to meet Yan Xishan, returned to Beiping yesterday and reported the meeting with Yan to He. It is heard that Hou's trip was successful, and Yan expressed his willingness to do his best to resolve the Sun-Ma dispute, so there may be no problems in the future.</p>
<p>Ma Hongkui's representative in Beiping, Bai Jianmin, paid a visit to He Yingqin at 10:00 AM this morning to report and ask for instructions on everything. Ma Hongkui telegraphed the authorities repeatedly, requesting that the 17th Army of Baoding, commanded by Xu Tingyao, be quickly dispatched to Baotou to attack the rear of the Sun army, so that a miraculous effect can be achieved militarily. The authorities are currently considering it. He Yingqin sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang today, reporting on the Sun-Ma war and requesting instructions on how to handle it. Sun Dianying also sent two telegrams to Beiping tonight, addressed to Wang Shiping, the director of his office in Beiping, instructing him to visit He and request that personnel be sent to the front to supervise the troop withdrawal and inquire whether the pay had been suspended. The telegram reads as follows: (1) Dear Shiping, I have received both your telegrams. I am very grateful for General He's goodwill towards our troops. Yesterday, I received a telegram from General He saying that he has not suspended our troops' pay, but I don't know if it has been suspended after all. If it is indeed suspended, I... (illegible)... If it is not suspended, I will abide by the method of not suspending it. There is no other way except to have General He send someone here. Brother Lian has sent several telegrams to General He requesting him to send someone. I hope you will continue to request it nearby. Your brother Kuiyuan, 30th. (2) Dear Shiping, in my telegram at noon on the 30th, I instructed you to see General He and inquire whether the pay has been suspended after all. You should quickly inquire and reply by telegram. If the pay is not suspended and personnel are sent to defend, I will abide by General He's orders in everything. Not only will I obey in this matter, but I will also support General He to the end in the future. Otherwise, if the pay is cut off, we will be in a dead end. Tens of thousands of troops cannot be maintained. If there is a glimmer of hope, who would be willing to go to Liangshan to become bandits? Whether to send people or not, whether to suspend pay or not, these two things are up to General He to decide. I am extremely anxious and have a fervent desire to support General He and the country. If I cannot be trusted because of this matter, I will regret it for the rest of my life and will be unable to rest day and night. How I hope you will quickly reply by telegram. Your brother Kuiyuan, 30th. (February 1st)</p>

<p>He Jian Telegraphs Denial of Hunan Army Entering Guizhou</p>
<p>Wang Jialie Telegraphs That Setbacks Will Be Resolved</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The situation in Guizhou recently broke down. Jiang Zizhen and Che Mingyi's troops in eastern Guizhou, in conjunction with a portion of Chen Quzhen's troops in western Hunan, attacked Wang Jialie's troops in the Laohushan area and fought fiercely with Bai Huizhang's division of Wang's troops for three days and nights. According to a telegram from Wang Jialie, they have repelled the troops. It is recently heard that Li Zongren of Guangxi Province is now actively mediating, and at the same time, he has reported to the Southwest Political Affairs Council and issued orders to all parties to stop the situation. At present, the Southwest authorities have sent Wu Houan, Miao Ruoxu, and Liu Qingnan to Guizhou to urge Mao Guangxiang to come to Guangdong. On the one hand, they have stopped military operations in Guizhou, and on the other hand, they are urging Wang to assist in Southwest political affairs in order to achieve a grand consolidation of the Southwest. At the same time, they have telegraphed He Jian of Hunan Province, requesting him to stop Chen's division in western Hunan from getting involved in the Guizhou war. He of Hunan replied yesterday by telegram, "I have respectfully received your telegram. Chen (Quzhen)'s troops in Fenghuang have been stationed in western Hunan to defend and intercept bandits. Whether they have colluded with the two divisions of Jiang (Pixu) and Che (Mingyi) to plot something and whether they have crossed the border into Guizhou this time to fuel the chaos in Guizhou, I will immediately order them to stop and investigate the truth in order to solidify our friendship between Hunan and Guizhou. Respectfully reported, He Jian, sealed." Recently, Zhang, a representative of He Jian, said that the Hunan army has always taken safeguarding the territory and pacifying the people as its duty, and defending the border. It is not yet known whether Chen's division clashed with the Guizhou army due to a misunderstanding. As for the claim that Chen Quzhen's troops have joined forces with the Jiang and Che of the Guizhou army, the Hunan army will definitely not do so, given the relationship of friendship between neighbors. With the mediation of various parties, the situation in Guizhou is now easing. Wang Jialie telegraphed on the 23rd, saying, "Since the representatives of Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces have mediated the situation in Guizhou, peace has been achieved. The overall situation here is exceptionally stable, and I am very optimistic about the future. Chen Quzhen, commander of the Hunan division, once invaded eastern Guizhou a few days ago. After my army's division commander Bai Huizhang sent troops to meet the attack, Chen's troops have retreated to their original defense in Fenghuang. We are now sending personnel to Hunan to explain and strengthen friendship with the neighboring province. This kind of small setback is not difficult to resolve. Please inform the Southwest authorities for verification." According to this, the disputes in Guizhou may be resolved within days. (Dispatch from the 29th of the 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e109">Journey of the Sichuan-Kang Expedition Group to Chongqing <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Lixing</p>
<p>Westward Journey from Shashi, Facing Perilous Rapids and Shoals</p>
<p>On the morning of January 26th, the boat departed Yichang, passing through the Xiling Gorge and arriving at Kongcang. This area has many submerged reefs, and the boat maneuvered windingly to avoid them. The most treacherous spot could barely accommodate one boat. The river pilot proceeded with utmost caution, as even a slight mistake could lead to capsizing. Next came Xintan, where the water current was incredibly rapid, estimated at over fifteen miles per hour. This natural water force could have been utilized to generate electricity but instead obstructed navigation. If the boat's engine power couldn't overcome the current, they had to rely on residents along the shore to pull them upstream with massive ropes. The residents considered the fees from this tow-rope labor as their sole income, knowing nothing else. Thus, this endowed wealth was merely a means for the shipping company and the residents to regulate poverty and wealth.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we entered the Wu Gorge, not exiting until evening. The boat drifted along, turning with the current, with no direction in sight. A single whistle blast echoed all around. Imagining the ancients mooring their small boats along the cliffs at night, with the bright moon, monkey cries, and the sound of the water, one cannot help but feel a sense of desolation. "The Wu Gorge in Badong's Three Gorges is long, with three monkey cries, tears wet the gown." This kind of scenery was a truthful depiction in those days. Even now, traveling by steamer and experiencing it firsthand, one still struggles to grasp the feeling fully. Times are different, and so are the perceptions. In the evening, we rested at Wushan County. County Magistrate Ma Siliang came aboard to meet us, and we learned about the county's general situation. The politics and finances were the same as in other places. The mineral resources were abundant, and the produced anthracite was of good quality but had no sales channels. Wushan has the Goddess Temple of Gaotang Mountain, but it is a dilapidated temple on an earthen hill, offering nothing of interest.</p>
<p>On the 27th, we passed through the Qutang Gorge, Yan Yu Heap, Eight Trigrams Formation, and White Emperor City. The magnificent scenery was exhilarating. That evening, we arrived at Wanxian. The city is built against the mountain, the park is splendid, and a stone bridge spans the valley, creating a spectacular view. We arrived at the shore at dusk. We visited the leader of the tung oil industry but did not meet him. We hurriedly returned to the boat. White mist filled the river, and the moonlight was bright. Suddenly, I realized that tonight was the eve of January 28th [Shanghai Incident], and the white mist over the river resembled battle smoke in my eyes.</p>
<p>On the 28th, we passed through Zhongxian, the hometown of Qin Liangyu, and Fengdu, the origin of myths. We anchored at Tangliang Stone for the night. The next morning, we passed through Fuzhou and reached Chongqing. From now on, we will delve deep into the interior of Sichuan Province. (Sent from Chongqing on January 30th)</p>
<p>Attached is a report from the Guowen News Agency: The "Minzhu" steamer, carrying the Shanghai journalists' Sichuan-Kang Expedition Group, arrived at Shashi at 2 PM on the 23rd. Due to refueling, there was a two-hour stop. The reporters disembarked for a cursory tour of the city, which belongs to Jiangling County, the Jingzhou where Guan Zhuangmu was stationed in the Three Kingdoms, controlling the key points of Chu, Shu, Xiang, and Long, and a strategic point for military strategists. Shashi was originally a sand deposit formed by the Yangtze River, about fifteen miles from Jiangling. Because it is located on the riverbank and is a key point in the communication between Sichuan and Hubei, the municipal facilities have made considerable progress. However, due to the impact of the collapse of the rural economy, commerce is very depressed. Most residents rely on the Yangtze River for a living, and their lives are simple. The dumping of foreign goods in the area is significant, and foreign advertisements are everywhere. There are very few domestic industrial products for daily use to be found. At about 4 PM, refueling was completed, and the anchor was raised. After traveling for dozens of miles, due to darkness and shallow water, we dared not sail at night, so we stopped the boat for the night. We set off again on the morning of the 24th and arrived at Yichang at about 6 PM that afternoon. Yichang is the first gateway to enter and exit Sichuan and Hubei, so the market is still lively. However, the purchasing power of the people does not seem to be strong. Perhaps it is also affected by the bankruptcy of the rural economy. Moreover, the dumping of foreign goods is even more severe than in Shashi, and strictly speaking, the municipal facilities seem to be inferior to those of Shashi. The "Minzhu" steamer had many procedures for unloading cargo, reporting inspections, and customs duties, etc. On the 25th, it was unable to set off. It only sailed west again on the morning of the 26th. Before long, we passed Ping Shan Ba, and entered the dangerous area of the Three Gorges between Sichuan and Hubei. The details of the Three Gorges are described below: From Ping Shan Ba in Hubei to Guandukou, it is generally called Xiling Gorge, with Huangniu Gorge, Otter Creek Shoal, Kongling Shoal, Xintan, Zhucang Gorge, Niugan Mafei Gorge, Xietan, Shimen Shoal, and Niukou Shoal. From Guandukou to Wushan, it is generally called Wu Gorge, with Mother Chicken Shoal, Twelve Peaks of Wushan, Golden Helmet Gorge, Silver Armor Gorge, General Shoal, Xiatan Shoal, and Baozi Shoal. From Tielan to Yan Yu Heap, it is generally called Qutang Gorge, which includes Tie Shoal, Black Stone Shoal, Fengxiang Gorge, Shiban Jia, and Yan Yu Heap. The above are all famous dangerous places, and there are countless other rapids and submerged reefs. Everything depends on the rich experience of the pilot to maneuver and avoid them.</p>
<p>That morning, the boat passed Ping Shan Ba and entered the midst of ten thousand mountains. Winding and twisting, the river flowed rapidly, circling with the mountain terrain on both sides, with layers of whirlpools and myriad dangers. On both sides, the high mountains stretched continuously, piercing the clouds and veiled in morning mist and lingering clouds, making it difficult to distinguish between mountains and clouds. Passing the Kongcang Shoal, with shallow water in spring and winter, rocks stood in the center of the river, their shapes ferocious. According to Chief Officer Lei on the boat, more than four boats have sunk here. At around 10 AM, we passed Niugan Mafei Gorge. On the cliffs standing beside the river, two rocks protruded, dividing evenly on the left and right, one shaped like a cow's liver, and the other like a horse's lung, both extremely lifelike. Just as we were admiring them in amazement, the boat reached Xintan. The water was raging, surging and turbulent, with a sound like thousands of troops and horses. The "Minzhu" steamer exerted all its strength, running at full power, to fight against the current. Eventually, the chimney turned red, and the raging fire still could not overcome the pressure of the water, and there was even a tendency to retreat. The ship owner and chief officer, seeing the situation was not good, frantically blew the whistle, and had no choice but to ask for help from the local people on both banks who relied on towing boats for a living. The current here was so rapid and swirling that a goose feather could sink to the bottom of the river. If accidentally crushed by the water, the entire boat could capsize and sink into the whirlpool. The method was to throw a lead rope to the shore. The local people who gathered upon hearing the sound caught the rope, struck it against the huge rocks, and worked hard to pull. The "Minzhu" steamer, in extreme danger, was able to use this help to sail through this stormy sea. After the towing was completed, the fee paid was more than two hundred yuan. Before long, the "Minxian" steamer of the Minsheng Company also arrived, and also asked them to do the same, charging the same amount. This is also a special livelihood for the local people on the river bank. After the boat traveled a little further, it passed Zigui, the hometown of Wang Zhaojun, and then passed Badong, a border county of Hubei Province, and the journey of Xiling Gorge came to an end. Continuing west, entering the border between Sichuan and Shu, the Twelve Peaks of Wushan came into view. Since the navigation of large ships on the Yangtze River, the sound of monkeys on both banks has been silent for a long time. According to the people of Shu, no trace of monkeys has been seen. At about 5 PM in the evening, because the coal was used up, we could not reach Kuifu, so we anchored at Wushan for the night. The reporter hired a sampan to go ashore, traveled six miles, climbed Yangtai Mountain, and climbed more than a hundred stone steps to reach Wushan County. This county is located in the easternmost part of Sichuan and the northern part of Hunan. Because the land is barren and the people are poor, the county town is desolate and the people's lives are simple beyond description. The reporter toured the city in the dim twilight. The county town is broad, spanning three to four miles, with few residents. The commercial situation is beyond discussion. We passed a popular education center converted from an abandoned courtyard, with the wooden doors tightly closed, making it impossible to enter. We passed Chongfeng Temple, and visited the police station and the militia defense office in the county, but we could not find the person in charge. Initially, we wanted to go to the county government, but we were afraid of the same result as the police station, so we went down the mountain and returned to the boat. We also did not have time to visit the famous Goddess Temple of Wushan. When we returned to the boat, County Magistrate Ma Siliang of Wushan County came to welcome us. We briefly discussed the various conditions of the county as follows: The county has a total area of more than 500 li, 120 li from east to west, and 300 li from north to south, bordering Badong in Hubei Province. The total population of the county is 220,000, mostly tenant farmers. All self-cultivating farmers have been displaced due to the increasingly bankrupt economy. The annual output of grain is 200,000 to 300,000 dan. Farmers do not eat rice due to heavy taxes and difficult times, and instead eat other foods. The other products include corn, sweet potatoes, and potatoes. The production of tallow can be used to make candles, the production of pears is worth 40,000 yuan a year, and the production of plums is worth 10,000 yuan. The county is mostly mountainous, with silver, copper, iron, and coal mines. The iron ore accounts for 60 percent, but due to lack of funds and mining methods, it is still abandoned on the ground. Occasionally, some people take it using traditional methods, but the effect is very small. Recently, a few guest residents have been panning for gold in Wushan County, and they can get one or two fen of gold a day. The education funding is about 15,000 yuan a year, allocated from the slaughter tax. There are three elementary schools for boys and girls, and the girls' elementary school has a normal class with only eight students. There are 33 elementary schools in the county's 33 townships. The county government's expenses are 539 yuan per month, the county judiciary is 100 yuan per month, and other items are not easy to calculate. According to County Magistrate Ma, the police station and the militia defense are just hanging a sign. The people of the county have the bad habit of uncles marrying nieces and elder brothers marrying younger sisters, which is considered a matter of course. The border area of neighboring Hubei Province has more men than women, and they often cross the mountains to marry women by force. This is also the misfortune of Wushan women.</p>
<p>At dawn on the 27th, the "Minzhu" steamer roared, echoing in the mountains, leaving Wushan Gorge and heading for the shoals of Qutang Gorge. Passing White Emperor City, the place where Liu Xianzhu entrusted his orphans, the mountains stand majestically, and the river roars. One can imagine the scene of the monarchs vying for power. The old city on the hillside is magnificent, with a foreign-style building next to it, the former residence of General Wu Ziyu, who kept a low profile and lived in seclusion. Beyond this is the water and land Eight Trigrams Formation laid out by Zhuge Wuhou. The water Eight Trigrams is a huge rock shaped like a ferocious beast, standing majestically in the center of the river. The land Eight Trigrams cannot be found. While reminiscing, the boat passed Kuizhou, the leading town at the head of Sichuan and Shu. It is a pity that we did not disembark and could not visit. Before long, we passed Yunyang, and there was a Temple of Marquis Huan on the river, with a magnificent atmosphere. The notorious and dangerous Yanyu He Qutang Gorge was safely crossed while admiring the scenery and reminiscing about the ancients. It was only felt that since entering Sichuan, because the river flow was rapid, the boat exhausted all its strength to travel against the current, so the hull shook from side to side, like sailing at sea. Moreover, the climate in Sichuan is much warmer than in the lower Yangtze provinces, and the mountains on both sides have long been green. The reporter left in a hurry and was wearing winter clothes, which was unbearable.</p>
<p>At 6 PM that night, we arrived at Wanxian and anchored. We hired a sampan to go ashore. The entire city is built on the hillside, and its terrain is very high. It takes hundreds of steps to climb up. The city is also winding and sloping due to the mountain terrain. Sitting in a rickshaw, it feels like going up and down bridges from time to time, making it very dangerous. Wanxian has been stationed in by Sichuan general Yang Sen for the longest time. This gentleman strives for reform and works hard to build. The roads in the city are wide and the municipal administration is novel. In particular, the Wan'an Bridge cost hundreds of thousands of yuan, and it is strong, wide, and flat, no less than the modern bridges in large cities. Citizens come and go in a lively manner, and commerce is still prosperous. There is only one thing worth mentioning. The currency system here is also very complicated. One silver coin can be exchanged for more than 800 copper coins, including the dangnian, dangwushi, and diaopiao. Moreover, because copper coins are becoming cheaper every day, there is a risk that they cannot be exchanged anywhere. The Shanghai banknotes and Hubei silver coins that the reporter brought with him are not commonly used in Wanxian. It is said that the currency system is different and not commonly used every dozens of miles in Sichuan Province. The reporter was discouraged by this. Since we traveled west, we have been using dangnian copper coins at a rate of more than 600 yuan in Hankou, and we already felt unaccustomed to it. We did not expect that the currency situation in Shashi, Yichang, Wushan, and Wanxian would get worse and worse. Tung oil produced in Sichuan is the main export commodity in Wanxian, and this place is an important commercial port for export. The Zhongyuan Company controls the bulk of tung oil exports. The reporter visited Mr. Dan, the manager of the company, but Mr. Dan was resting at home due to a minor illness and could not meet him. We entrusted the company's staff to convey our sincerity and planned to visit him again on the way back to Shanghai via Wanxian to inquire about the overall situation of the tung oil export industry in Sichuan, as well as the national and international trade situation of the tung oil industry, which only Mr. Dan knows best. Because we arrived late, we did not have time to visit public and private organizations and groups, and the "Minzhu" steamer was scheduled to set sail early on the morning of the 28th, so we quickly returned to the boat after touring Wan City. The Wan City Park, which is one of the best in the Yangtze River Basin, has been famous for a long time, but we did not have time to visit it due to time constraints. In short, the reconstruction and construction of the county after being bombed by British warships is commendable.</p>
<p>In the early morning of the 28th, we left Wanxian in a misty fog. The dangerous shoals of the Three Gorges have all been crossed. There are occasional rapids here, but there is little danger, so the boat sped up. At noon, we passed Zhongxian, the hometown of Qin Liangyu, a female hero who resisted the bandit Zhang Xianzhong at the end of the Ming Dynasty. At 5 PM in the afternoon, we passed Fengdu. The people of this county are particularly superstitious. There are 108 temples in the county, all of which are statues of the gods of the underworld. The so-called "road guide" is sold in the temples, which is placed in the coffin of the deceased, saying that the soul can pass through the passes and mountains without hindrance. They also divide the yin and yang realms, and the people all live in the yang realm, and there are no residents in the yin realm. Their stupidity is pitiful and ridiculous. Unfortunately, the boat passed Fengdu without stopping, and it is a pity that we could not go ashore to see the strange shapes there. After traveling dozens of miles further, we anchored for the night because it was late and dark.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 29th, the mountain miasma shrouded the Yangtze River, and the sky turned dark and cold. The boat sailed with oars. At noon, we passed Fuzhou, but we did not stop. After dinner, we packed our luggage, and the boat arrived in Chongqing at 5 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Original Text of the Proposal to Control National Grain <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Beijing News: During the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, committee members Liu Zhi, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Lifu, and Zhou Qigang proposed to control the nation's grain supply to promote rural recovery. They also drafted a detailed plan, which was submitted to and approved by the 393rd Central Political Conference. It was then handed over to the National Economic Committee. The original text of the proposal and plan are recorded below: "Reasons": Upon thorough examination of the current state of our nation, only two things are apparent: bandits causing turmoil and foreign powers encroaching, threatening the very existence of the nation; agriculture is in ruins, lands are desolate, even those lands that are not desolate are near ruin, rural areas are depopulated, and refugees flood the roads; the virtuous are without means, while the wicked prosper, causing morality to decline and livelihoods to be lost, making the nation unsustainable. Considering these two points, it can be said that domestic worries and foreign troubles, national crises and tribal dangers, have all reached their extremes. Those who provide relief mostly advocate suppressing bandits and resisting foreign aggression simultaneously, which is considered the best approach. However, it is not known that bandits are also people. Who would risk their lives if they were not driven by hunger and cold? When foreign aggression comes, without adequate accumulation of resources and education, merely engaging in intermittent resistance will likely yield little hope of success. Those with insight consider the restoration of rural areas as a matter of urgency, which is indeed a fitting remedy. The revival of rural areas will not only quell banditry but also lay the foundation for wealth and strength. What internal and external troubles are worth mentioning? However, this matter is of great importance. How to ensure that the people have enough food, how to alleviate the economic pressure on grain, how to harmonize grain prices, how to increase grain production, how to improve the quality of grain, how to enable people to live and work in peace, and how to allow people to recuperate, all require national planning, central coordination, and a comprehensive system with meticulous measures, as well as grand strategies that are broadly applicable. Piecemeal policies that address only the immediate problems will not be sufficient for this important task. I have drafted a brief outline of measures to control national grain based on my limited observations, hoping to contribute to the discussion. Whether it is appropriate or not is up for public deliberation. "Measures": (1) Organization: A National Grain Control Committee will be established in the capital, with three departments: management, technology, and training, responsible for administrative technology and training related to grain control. Each provincial capital will establish a Grain Control Committee for that province, directly subordinate to the National Grain Control Committee, with three departments: management, technology, and training. The management department will then establish branches in each county and city, as well as agricultural warehouses in each district. The technology department will then establish seven organizations: rice and wheat fields, miscellaneous grain fields, an insect bureau, an agricultural implements manufacturing plant, a soil survey institute, a fertilizer management office, and a collective farm. The training department will then establish three organizations: a rural cooperative training institute, an agricultural training institute, and a warehouse management training institute. Each department of the National Grain Control Committee will also do the same when necessary. (2) Tasks: The tasks of the Control Committee are: 1. To plan and organize national or provincial grain control matters; 2. To promulgate national or provincial laws and regulations regarding grain control; 3. To promote cooperatives and cooperative warehouses for grain transportation, sales, consumption, and storage; 4. To determine the quantity of grain storage, transportation, sales, and distribution in various places; 5. To determine the quantity of grain to be bought and sold externally; 6. To raise funds to regulate grain prices. The tasks of the Management Department are: 1. To implement various resolutions of the Control Committee; 2. To guide and supervise the investigation and statistics of grain nationwide or province-wide; 3. To guide the registration of grain harvests and imports and exports nationwide or province-wide; 4. To establish and manage agricultural warehouses; 5. To guide, promote, and supervise cooperatives and cooperative warehouses for grain transportation, sales, consumption, and storage. The tasks of the Technology Department are: 1. To implement various resolutions of the Control Committee regarding the improvement of grain production technology; 2. To research methods to increase grain production and improve quality; 3. To design the construction of new-style warehouses; 4. To research methods to conserve grain consumption. The tasks of the Training Department are: 1. To increase farmers' knowledge and skills in farming; 2. To increase farmers' knowledge of rural organizations; 3. To increase farmers' true spirit of mutual assistance; 4. To enable farmers to reform bad customs in rural areas; 5. To enable farmers to understand the benefits and methods of various agricultural cooperatives; 6. To train warehouse management personnel. The tasks of each county and city branch are: 1. To handle grain control matters within the jurisdiction according to the orders of the provincial management department; 2. To investigate and statistically count the population and grain consumption within the jurisdiction; 3. To investigate and statistically count the amount of grain stored within the jurisdiction; 4. To register grain harvests or imports and exports and market information within the jurisdiction; 5. To determine the quantity of grain storage, transportation, sales, and distribution in each district; 6. To supervise grain prices within the jurisdiction and crack down on unscrupulous merchants who monopolize, manipulate, adulterate, and mix grain; 7. To promote and supervise cooperatives and cooperative warehouses for grain transportation, sales, consumption, and storage within the jurisdiction; 8. To investigate and statistically count the grain disaster situation and the causes of famine within the jurisdiction; 9. To raise funds to regulate grain prices within the jurisdiction; 10. To inspect the grade of grain within the jurisdiction. The tasks of the district agricultural warehouse are: 1. To ensure the stability of the agricultural market; 2. To ensure the circulation of agricultural finance; 3. To concentrate grain; 4. To apply various scientific methods to manage grain storage; 5. To promote grain transportation and sales cooperatives and consumer cooperatives. The rice and wheat fields will select rice and wheat varieties that are abundant in yield and resistant to pests and diseases, and after improving their cultivation methods, they will be promoted to farmers. The miscellaneous grain fields will select miscellaneous grain varieties that are abundant in yield and resistant to pests and diseases, and after improving their cultivation methods, they will be promoted to farmers. The Insect Bureau will study methods to prevent and control pests and protect beneficial insects, as well as grain insecticides and equipment, and distribute them to farmers in various places. The Agricultural Implements Manufacturing Plant will research and create various suitable agricultural implements and promote them to farmers. It will also investigate the old and new agricultural implements that require less effort and yield more results, and imitate or improve them, so that they are fully applicable to the agricultural conditions of each area before promoting them to farmers. The Fertilizer Management Office will conduct various experiments on ordinary crops and fertilizers, and use scientific methods to produce pure and high-quality artificial fertilizers, stipulate their application standards and methods, and promote them to farmers. It will also manage and crack down on artificial fertilizers that are adulterated and harmful to farmland. The Soil Survey Institute will conduct investigations and statistics on various types of soil in various places, and study methods to improve them and promote them to farmers. The Collective Farm will apply scientific theories, methods, and equipment to carry out large-scale land reclamation. The Rural Cooperative Training Institute will teach farmers the theories, benefits, and methods of various agricultural cooperatives, so that they can automatically promote various agricultural cooperatives. The Agricultural Training Institute will teach farmers various new knowledge and technologies in agriculture, forestry, silkworm breeding, and so on, so that they can apply them. The Warehouse Management Training Institute will teach people new knowledge and methods of scientific warehouse management, so that they can apply them. 3. System Table: For the sake of clarifying the entire organization of the Grain Control Committee, its system table is listed below:</p>

<p>Police Inspection of Hotel Dispute</p>
<p>On the 28th, late at night, police officers from the responsible public security station inspected the Andong Hotel in Jiaxing East Gate. They also forced the hotel to sign a guarantee and took one accountant and one tea server to the headquarters for detention. The next day, they handcuffed the two men and escorted them to the local branch court. After questioning, they were found to have no criminal suspicion and were ordered to return. Now, the Public Security Bureau believes that the case constitutes obstruction of public service and has filed a lawsuit with the court. The prosecutor's office has scheduled a hearing for the 5th to summon witnesses for questioning. The hotel, on the other hand, believes that the unwarranted detention and handcuffing of its staff constitute a violation of criminal law. They also argue that public officials abusing their power are different from ordinary criminals. They have hired lawyers to file complaints with both the judicial and administrative authorities.</p>

<p>The Manufacturing of Candies From Past to Present</p>
<p>—  Xi Guansheng</p>
<p>In recent years, domestic industry has transformed from purely old-fashioned methods to imitation manufacturing. Furthermore, many light industries have indeed achieved considerable success. This demonstrates that while various aspects of China have stagnated over the past twenty years, the industrial sector has shown a trend of rapid advancement.</p>
<p>Domestic scientific candy production is also a unit of light industry. From sesame candy to European-style candy, its color, aroma, and taste can certainly compete with imported products. This also shows the formation of a new and modern landscape, and Guanshengyuan is a contributing member. In the past decade, we have produced over a hundred types of candies. The "Top Ten Candies" are the part that we dare to be confident about. Unexpectedly, the domestic candy market dominated by foreign merchants has gradually lost its original position in recent years. This is undoubtedly the result of Chinese people's love for domestic products, which has preserved a great deal of the nation's vitality.</p>
<p>Now, let me tell fellow compatriots who love domestic goods about the past and present of our candy manufacturing.</p>
<p>The early period of the decline of old-fashioned candies was precisely when foreign candies were rampant. Countries such as England, America, and Japan were the first to import, followed by competition from other countries. The domestic market was almost entirely dominated by foreign merchants. The reason was that at that time, customs sovereignty was controlled by foreign advisors, and the import of candies was only intended to supply foreign residents in places like Tianjin and Beijing, so no one paid attention, and no taxes were levied. As a result, foreign candies were imported in large quantities. Initially, they only became popular among the aristocracy, but after several years of aggressive marketing by foreigners, they spread to the upper and middle classes in the treaty ports. At that time, based on the nationality of the candy, there were English, American, German, French, Japanese, Swiss, Dutch, and Russian candies. By type, there were all kinds imaginable. In particular, a certain country's chewing gum had the largest sales. In the face of foreign merchants competing with each other, our economic losses were undoubtedly enormous. Guanshengyuan, alerted to this crisis, began manufacturing its own candies, hoping to recover partial profits from a small starting point. Today's "Top Ten Candies" are precisely our small achievements from ten years of effort. The main conditions for candy are color, aroma, and taste. However, we confidently invite our fellow countrymen to try our candies and offer strict criticism to see if they can be compared with imported goods.</p>
<p>Recovering rights and interests was my initial motivation for starting manufacturing. But there are still things I can tell my fellow countrymen: (1) Mechanical equipment costs millions at every turn. It is not easy to gather such large funds in the budding stage of industry. However, most of our application equipment is self-made. Although the cost is small, the effect is the same. This is one way we have broken through difficult circumstances and practiced industrial salvation. (2) We have never had Western technicians. We rely entirely on the experience of experts returning from America and a constant attitude of research to gradually reach the intended standards. (3) The raw materials for European-style candies are mostly imported from foreign countries. In this way, although we recovered some rights on the commodity, the raw materials are still a huge loss. Therefore, in addition to what we cannot manufacture ourselves, we adopt a policy of self-sufficiency in raw materials. (4) Excellent candies should at least have (A) authentic raw materials, (B) rich nutrition, and (C) moderate sweetness. For ten years, we have never dared to relax on the above three points. At the same time, imported candies are priced incredibly high and cannot suit the purchasing power of ordinary people. However, compared to our prices, Guanshengyuan products are about 40-50% cheaper, reducing the burden on customers, which was also the initial motivation for manufacturing.</p>
<p>That's all I have to say. I hope that my valued customers will not hesitate to give me your guidance!</p>

<h3 id="e126">Construction Process <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Wen Yuqing, Director of the International Telecommunications Bureau, published the construction process of the international radio station, saying that the 46th meeting of the Guangdong Political Branch Association on August 5, 1928, had a proposal to establish an international radio station and telegraphed the Central Political Conference to implement it. Later, in November of that year, the Construction Committee ordered four sets of Lowatt transceivers from the German Telefunken Company and two sets of 20-kilowatt transceivers from the American Associated Wireless Radio Company to build a transmitting station in Zhenru and Fenglin Bridge in Shanghai, and a receiving station in Liuhang, Baoshan. It also signed direct communication contracts between Shanghai and Manila, Shanghai and San Francisco, and Shanghai and Berlin with the Philippine Associated Wireless Radio Company, the American Associated Wireless Radio Company, and the German Berlin Marine Wireless Radio Company. Before the completion of the Zhenru and Fenglin Bridge stations, a Sino-Philippine transfer radio station was established in Shanghai, equipped with two 500-watt transmitters. On January 14, 1929, it officially communicated with Manila. In February of that year, the Ministry of Communications ordered a 15-kilowatt transceiver from the French Long-Distance Telephone Company. In April, the International Communications Large Radio Station Preparatory Office was organized, and a direct communication contract was signed between Shanghai and Paris with the French Wireless Radio Company. In August, the Ministry of Communications was ordered to unify the national wireless radio management powers, and the wireless radio business operated by the Construction Committee was taken over and merged. Base collection, construction of station buildings, roads, bridges, and installation of equipment, antennas, cables, power, and other equipment were actively carried out in Zhenru and Liuhang. In March 1930, the Fenglin Bridge transmitting station was completed. In November, the Zhenru transmitting station and the Liuhang receiving station were completed. On December 6, they officially communicated directly with European and American countries.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Expansion of Construction <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>London, England, is the world's commercial center. The telegrams between our country and London account for almost half of the foreign telegraph fees, but there is still no direct line. In June 1932, the Ministry of Communications negotiated with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund to borrow £50,000 in British gold to order two 20-kilowatt high-energy short-wave receiving machines from the British Marconi Company, and signed a Sino-British communication contract with the London Imperial Transport Company. New buildings were added to the Zhenru transmitting station, new machines were installed, and antenna towers were added. In addition, the remote-controlled transmission aerial cables between Shanghai Zhenru and Shanghai Liuhang were easily damaged. A 50-pair underground cable was ordered from the British Xiangtai Foreign Company to be laid to ensure permanence. A backup power plant and a machine factory were set up in the Zhenru transmitting station to facilitate the acquisition of current and the repair of machines. All expansion projects were completely completed by the end of last year and were successfully tested with the United Kingdom. The opening ceremony is scheduled to be held today and officially communicated.</p>
<h3 id="e128">A Glimpse of the Radio Station <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency drove to Zhenru yesterday afternoon for a visit. He was led by the station engineer Zong Zhifa and explained everything. Two Sino-British receivers are installed after the Sino-American reporting machine. Special new houses have been added there, arranged horizontally in the middle. Each machine is divided into four parts, gradually increasing the power, and then transmitting it to the antenna for distribution. The bulb in the last part is as big as a dipper. Because the heat is too high, oil is used to adjust it to dissipate heat. At the left end of another machine, there is a live machine. According to Zong, the reporter is actively preparing for calls, and the central control room on Nanjing Road has now been opened as a broadcast room. After the ceremony tomorrow (ie today), Minister Zhu Jiahua also plans to give a broadcast speech to the United Kingdom in that room at 8:00 PM. He then went to the Sino-Philippine and Sino-French communication rooms. Each machine was similar. Later, he led to the power generation room for a visit. Although the machine has been installed, it is not usually used, because the station uses commercial electricity, and it has its own generator for backup in case of commercial electricity obstacles. Outside the power generation room, there are several lathes for repairing other parts. There are now eight antenna towers. Three were originally installed, three are newly built, and two were moved from Hangzhou and Wusong. The European beam antenna tower is directed northwest, and the American one is directed southeast. The staff dormitory is newly built on the west side of the yard. The station covers an area of more than two hundred acres, with each station building built around the perimeter, with trees planted everywhere. The scenery is quite good.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Kong Xiangxi Talks About the Executive Yuan's Consolidation of Land Tax <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Measures Based on Reports from Various Provinces</p>
<p>Director of the Unified Tax Administration Xie Qi Resigns and is Persuaded to Stay</p>
<p>Financial Institutions in Min Province Gradually Recover</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, has been going to the Finance Ministry Office to work and contacting all important officials since he returned to Shanghai from Beijing. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency visited Kong at his residence yesterday afternoon to discuss various matters as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e134">Consolidation of Land Tax <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>According to Kong, the land tax case submitted by the Ministry of Finance at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, after being passed by the congress, has been handed over to the Executive Yuan for research and handling. However, the land tax collection situation in various provinces varies from place to place. How to prudently request tax reductions and carry out consolidation still requires detailed measures based on the reports submitted by the various provinces in the past before it can be implemented. If we must conduct another investigation before holding it, I am afraid the time will be too long and it will be difficult to realize. As for the land declarations that have already been handled by various provinces and counties, in order to avoid formalities, they will not be held accountable.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Foreign Rice and Wheat <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>As for the issue of import duties on foreign rice and wheat, it was passed by the Legislative Yuan in August of last year. Later, because Minister Song attended the World Economic Conference in London, our country joined the tariff truce and it was not held. By November 16th, after our side notified the countries in the tariff truce and officially withdrew, because it would only take effect after one month, and at the same time, after I took office, all parties urged me to hold it, so it was only implemented on December 16th to save domestic agricultural products. After the announcement, Guangdong Province is still a tax-free port because both rice and wheat in Guangdong Province must rely on external supply. However, because the domestic supply and demand have not been balanced, we will continue to find ways to transport and sell rice and wheat produced in the Yangtze River area to Guangdong to balance it. The effect of saving the domestic rural economy will be even greater.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Tax Reduction Issues <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The reporter then asked how the Ministry of Finance would deal with the request from wheat flour merchants for tax exemptions. According to him, this fact originated from the excessively high price of American wheat. It turned out that there was 10 million US dollars in American cotton and wheat loans to buy American wheat. Because the price of American wheat was too high, for example, the world wheat price was 2.56 yuan, and China was only about 2.2 yuan, but American wheat had to be 2.8 yuan, so merchants felt quite difficult. Now the United States has not agreed to reduce the price, but the Ministry of Finance, in order to be considerate of merchants, will not cause merchants to suffer excessively, and is currently in consultation.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Persuading Xie Qi to Stay <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>He also said that Xie Qi, Director of the Unified Tax Administration, requested leave because his wife was ill. Director Xie was afraid that the leave would be too long and would delay official business, so he submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Finance. However, Director Xie is very familiar with and proficient in taxation, and has an excellent reputation, so I did not approve it and decided to persuade him to stay.</p>

<p>As for the tax collection institutions in Min Province, the Ministry of Finance has long sent personnel to gradually recover them and work as usual. The post-disaster expenses in Min Province are all raised by the Min Provincial Government itself, and the central government does not need to allocate funds to handle the post-disaster issues in Min Province.</p>

<p>In order to alleviate the decline of the countryside</p>
<p>In order to understand the financial situation clearly, financial giants such as Zhang Gongquan and Xu Xinliu in this city will conduct a national financial investigation. This type of investigation is purely initiated by the financial community in this city and is not entrusted by the Ministry of Finance. According to banking circles, the business of the silver and money circles in this city has been decreasing year by year. Although the reason is due to the decline of the rural economy and frequent disasters, the inability to understand the financial situation in various places is also a major reason. Alleviating the decline of the countryside, the banking community in this city should provide assistance under the guidance of the government. Currently, the banking community in this city has an organization of committees that specializes in this matter. As for the investigation of national finance, it will be automatically gathered and conducted by the financial community. On the one hand, it can understand the national financial situation, and on the other hand, it can alleviate the countryside based on the investigation.</p>

<p>The Banking Association of this port has been established for one year since it established the bill exchange office last year. The number of exchanges has increased day by day, and the convenience for colleagues has become more obvious. The association reflects on past experiences and looks forward to future progress. It deeply feels that the reform of things must first have a clear understanding and research of actual habits. Leading in accordance with the situation can be effective. It also relies on collecting opinions widely to achieve properness. Therefore, it intends to investigate the bill clearing habits of domestic financial colleagues and its advantages and disadvantages, and solicit opinions for improvement. The association will organize, edit, and print it into a book, and has specially ordered the essay solicitation charter to welcome domestic financial and academic people to contribute actively based on their observations. After being selected, the association will pay a reward of business bookstore coupons ranging from 30 yuan, 20 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan.</p>

<p>The Hubei Construction Department is planning to build two new-style ferries to travel exclusively on the Wuchang Hankou River to carry people to and from the three towns. It entrusted shipbuilding experts in Shanghai to draft the ferry drawings on their behalf. The department then requested the shipping department of the China Merchants Bureau to ask various experts to design and draw detailed dimensions for construction.</p>
<p>Proposed Hull The engineers in the China Merchants Bureau's shipping department, entrusted by the Hubei Construction Department, referred to the water level of the Wuhan River and the situation of the ferry wharf, and planned according to the latest drawings. The length of the ship is 110 feet, the width is 25 feet, and the draft is 6 feet. The entire ship is mainly for carrying passengers, so there are more passenger seats, and it can carry more than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>Cost of Two Ships The two ferries are built with steel. After detailed estimates of all machines, engines, boilers, and hulls, the cost of each ship is 60,000 yuan, and the total cost of the two ships is 120,000 yuan. Yesterday, the engineers explained the entire hull plan, including dimensions, coal consumption, speed, and strength, and submitted it to the Hubei Construction Department. It is said that the Hubei Construction Department has decided to entrust the Shanghai Jiangnan Factory to build it.</p>
<h3 id="e143">New Aircraft of China Aviation Corporation Transported to Lunghua for Assembly <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Expected to be assembled within a week and immediately undergo test flights</p>
<p>Decision to resume original flight schedule on the Shanghai-Guangdong line</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, after the China Aviation Corporation's Sikorsky No. 16 aircraft, which flew the Shanghai-Guangdong route, encountered an accident and was damaged near the Zhoushan Islands last year, the route only had one aircraft, No. 17, flying back and forth. The company reduced the number of flights to maintain passenger and mail services and immediately ordered a new twin-engine aircraft from the Sikorsky Aircraft Factory in the United States to supplement its fleet. It is now learned that the parts for the new aircraft arrived in Shanghai on the Beidmeske cargo ship of the American Export Lines at 12:30 PM on the 31st of last month, after being loaded in the United States. The company immediately reported to the Jianghai Customs for inspection and took delivery of the goods. Yesterday, the company spokesperson told the Xin Xin News Agency reporter that all the parts for the new aircraft were transported from the Gonghexiang Wharf to the Lunghua Airport Aircraft Factory by truck at 9:00 AM on the 1st. Assembly work is now underway and is expected to be completed within a week. After a test flight, if the performance is good, it is planned to add it to the Shanghai-Guangdong-Hangzhou route to replace aircraft No. 16. At that time, it is also planned to restore the original flight schedule on that route to facilitate the development of passenger and mail services.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications, in response to the accident involving a China Aviation Corporation Shanghai-Guangdong flight in November of last year, dispatched aviation experts and established a committee to study the incident. The committee concluded that climate was the cause. Therefore, the Ministry specifically instructed both Eurasia and China Aviation Corporations to stipulate flight procedures. The Ministry order is recorded as follows: Postal transport aviation values safety above all else, and examining the climate before takeoff is closely related to safety. Hereafter, on any route, between any two locations, if the altitude limit is less than 500 feet and the visibility is less than one mile, no passenger flights should be made to avoid unexpected situations en route. It is hereby ordered that the company transmit these instructions to all pilots to strictly comply with and report back to the ministry. This order.</p>

<p>Public notice posted yesterday</p>
<p>Three points to note</p>
<p>The Bureau of Commodity Inspection, in order to comply with the order to change to the new system of weights and measures, specially issued Public Notice No. 341 yesterday, stating: "According to Instruction No. 23185 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, after changing the units of quantity for commodity inspection to the new system of weights and measures, the amount of inspection fees should be converted accordingly. The Ministry is currently revising all commodity inspection fees in a comprehensive manner.

Aside from distribution, you are hereby ordered to comply with this order." Upon receipt of this instruction, the Bureau immediately began implementation from today. The points to note are listed below: (1) When applying for inspection, the quantities in the old system should be converted to the new system. (2) On the application form and certificate, the quantity in the new system should be written before the quantity in the old system, which should be written in parentheses.

<p>Forms prepared, special section chief dispatched to Shanghai for face-to-face consultation</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has ordered the Directorate General of Posts to continue conducting population surveys. The instruction is recorded as follows: The Directorate General of Posts conducted population surveys in the years 1919 and 1925, which were quite effective. Unfortunately, these surveys have not been continued since 1925. Not only are those concerned with the national population greatly disappointed, but the Ministry also often lacks a basis for administrative planning. After careful consideration, the Ministry believes that it is necessary to continue conducting these surveys. Therefore, two types of forms have been prepared, and the methods are attached to the back of the form, which are simple and easy to implement and will not interfere with business. Section Chief Wang Zhongwu of the Ministry is hereby dispatched to the Directorate with the forms for face-to-face consultation. You are hereby ordered to properly discuss and implement the surveys and report the progress to the Ministry at any time. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e148">China Savings Bank Ordered to Close at the End of this Month <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Deposits of depositors will be returned in accordance with regulations</p>
<p>The China Savings Bank, located at the intersection of Henan Road and Jiaotong Road, has been in existence for ten years. The main reason for its establishment was to imitate the methods of the International Savings Society, solicit depositors, and operate prize-linked savings. The fixed capital was 500,000 yuan, divided into three types of depositors: three yuan, six yuan, and twelve yuan. The top prize was 500 yuan, and the remaining prizes were handled in accordance with the methods of the International Savings Society. In the beginning, the number of depositors was quite large, but it gradually decreased. Manager Shan Yiting and the shareholders were all North China merchants. In ordinary times, they also handled current deposits and loans.</p>
<p>Ordered to suspend business Since its establishment, the bank has never joined the Bankers Association. Its main business was prize-linked savings. After the Qi-Lu War, it suffered a major setback. The shareholders had long intended to close down the bank. However, prize-linked savings by banks is prohibited by law. Therefore, after an investigation by the Ministry of Finance, the bank was ordered to cease operations.</p>
<p>Closing at the end of the month After receiving the order, the bank published a notice of closure in the newspaper on the 31st of last month and immediately began closing operations. It was originally scheduled to complete all operations in three days, but some depositors received the news later and were unable to withdraw their deposits in time. Therefore, the deadline has been extended to the end of this month. As of now, there are still more than 80 depositors, with terms of ten and six years. All deposits will be returned in accordance with regulations. Current deposits and loans also amount to tens of thousands of yuan. These were all gradually settled and repaid by the end of the lunar year.</p>

<p>To facilitate water transportation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you regarding a joint letter received on the 31st of this month from the rice milling industry, miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry, bean and rice industry, miscellaneous grain industry, miscellaneous grain retail industry, rice and grain sales industry, and other trade associations in this city, as well as Fuxin No. 1 Flour Mill, Jiangsu Bank Warehouse, Four Banks Joint Savings Society Warehouse, Yukang Warehouse, Shanghai Jiaotong Bank Warehouse, Lao Yongchang Coal Company, Yifeng Machinery Sawmill, Hengkang Warehouse, Taichang Kangji Firm, Xieji West Warehouse, Shanghai Guohua Bank Warehouse Department, Shengren Coal Company, Yucheng Timber Company, Yongcheng Coal Company, Deli Runyuan Bamboo Firm, Tongxingshunji Warehouse, Yixing Yuanji Foreign Warehouse, Xintong Foreign Warehouse, Yitaixing Coal Company, and Yutong Fuji Flour Mill, stating that during the winter season, when the water is low, ships are congested in the Suzhou Creek area, often blocking traffic. As a result, merchants suffer significant losses in freight. Although the Water Patrol Team maintains and clears the waterway day and night, this is a temporary solution and not a fundamental solution. Your association is the leader of the commercial community, and we would like to request that you write to the dredging engineering office of the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau to quickly take advantage of the low water in the winter season to dredge the silted parts of the Suzhou Creek to facilitate traffic. This is our earnest plea." It has been verified that there is a large amount of siltation in the waterways of the Suzhou Creek area, and water transportation is often obstructed. Taking advantage of the low water in the winter season to dredge the silted areas is indeed a crucial step. Accordingly, we are forwarding the situation as described above, and we respectfully request that your bureau instruct the dredging engineering office to commence dredging immediately to facilitate waterway traffic. We eagerly anticipate this."</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after the completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, the long-distance buses operated by the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration traveled from Hangzhou via Haining Zhapu to Minhang, connecting with the Shanghai-Minhang buses to Shanghai, which was convenient for travelers. In December of last year, due to military reasons and busy transportation, there were not enough vehicles allocated, so all the branch lines belonging to the route, such as Linping-Changan, Yuanhua-Pinghu, etc., were completely suspended. At the same time, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway passenger buses were reduced to two trips up and down each day. Now, the National Economic Commission and the Highway Administration have allocated vehicles to find ways to restore the service. It is expected that the service can be fully restored to its original state by the end of this month.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is handling national water and land joint transportation. The Longhai Railway has already implemented the agreement. The Jiaoji Railway agreement was signed yesterday. The Qingdao Municipal Government and the Jiaoji Railway sent personnel to Shanghai and then to Guangdong to inspect joint transportation. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e154">Agreement Signed <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Jiaoji Railway are conducting joint transportation on the Jiaoji Railway in accordance with the joint transportation regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Railways. The detailed rules of implementation had already been drafted by both parties, totaling eleven articles, and were written in duplicate. The Jiaoji Railway had already signed the agreement, and Sun Zhenwu, the director of the Qingdao branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, brought it to Shanghai. It was approved by the 56th board meeting of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Due to procedural reasons, it was delayed until yesterday, when General Manager Liu Hongsheng officially signed the agreement. The Jiaoji Railway and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company each kept a copy and submitted it to the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications for record.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Personnel Sent for Inspection <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>

<p>The freight rates for joint transportation on the Jiaoji Railway had already been drafted by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Jiaoji Railway and were planned to be officially implemented on March 1st. However, it is necessary to wait until Tan Shukuai, Wang Xichang, and Sun Zhenwu return to Shanghai from Guangdong to discuss and decide. In general, there will be no problems. As for joint transportation matters, the Qingdao branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will jointly with the Jiaoji Railway set up a joint transportation office in Qingdao to handle the matters. No separate office will be established in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Opposition Ineffective <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>After the Jiaoji Railway was recovered from Japan by our country, Japanese merchants such as the Dalian Kisen Kaisha tried to oppose the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's handling of joint transportation, claiming that the redemption price of the Jiaoji Railway had not been paid. However, the Jiaoji Railway and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will not stop due to the opposition of Japanese merchants. It is expected that after the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company implements joint transportation on the Jiaoji Railway, private transportation companies such as Sanbei Zhengji and foreign companies such as Jardine Matheson and Taikoo Dalian will not be unable to operate, because in the future, when joint transportation is implemented, goods will be divided into two types: joint transportation and non-joint transportation.</p>

<p>The Cooperative Enterprise Committee of this city held its 14th standing committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Committee members Wang Zhixin (representing Miao Zizhong), Wu Juenong, Wu Huanru, Xu Yefu (representing Wang Gang), Zhang Binghui, Wang Shuji, and Hang Dingan attended. Chairman Zhang Binghui presided over the meeting and discussed that the scope of the committee's work plan last year was too broad, and due to limitations in financial and human resources, it was not possible to fully realize each item. There were shortcomings in the development of committee affairs. In order to avoid repeating the same mistakes, it was decided to focus the committee's work on a few key points and achieve them within a limited time frame in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. The following proposals were resolved: (1) How should the committee's work be carried out this year? (Resolution) 1. Promote workers' consumer cooperation in this city. 2. Investigate the cooperative societies that have already been established in this city. 3. Provide practical guidance to the cooperative experiment area. (2) Should the committee compile and publish publications for publicity purposes? (Resolution) 1. The committee's business report should be published within a limited time. Materials should be provided by the committee members as much as possible. 2. Compile a booklet in plain language on the organization methods and cooperative significance of cooperative societies for publicity purposes. (3) If the Bureau of Social Affairs approves the recruitment of workers' consumer cooperation instructors, how should the committee assist in the handling? (Resolution) First, request the Bureau of Social Affairs to publish recruitment advertisements, conduct screening, and then organize an examination committee to hold a re-examination.</p>

<p>Tsunezawa and Okamoto</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, although some Japanese taxpayers in the Public Concession are campaigning to make Tsunezawa the chairman of the board of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), it was learned yesterday (the 1st) that Tsunezawa has decided that he is unwilling to be a candidate for councilor in this term. The reason is exactly as predicted by the North China Daily News on Wednesday, that is, he is busy with official duties, and he often has to leave Shanghai to handle the duties of the Japanese Spinners' Association. However, it was heard that relevant Japanese people held an informal meeting last night and strongly urged Tsunezawa to be a candidate again. Tsunezawa was initially unwilling, but finally complied with the public request. Therefore, when the SMC elects councilors in this term, the Japanese candidates will still be Tsunezawa and Okamoto.</p>

<p>The Huayang Yizhen Association on Renji Road in this city received a letter yesterday from the Water Disaster Relief Committee of Changyuan County, Hebei Province. The letter is transcribed below: "To all kind-hearted members of the Huayang Yizhen Association, the Yellow River raged, breaching dikes and causing damage. Three provinces suffered, and our Changyuan was particularly severe. Fortunately, we received your thoughtful and generous aid, charitable broth, and righteous garments, which were well distributed. We have received the virtue of life and the kindness of clothing and bedding. Our gratitude cannot be expressed in words. Unexpectedly, as the hope for life was just beginning to turn, a sudden flood occurred. Within a day and night, more than a hundred villages along both banks of the dike were again submerged. The old, the young, women, and children climbed onto roofs and trees, and their cries were extremely miserable. Boats were used to rescue them, but ice piled up, and the currents rushed wildly. The disaster victims who did not die from drowning were certainly frozen to death by the ice. But no matter what, how can we bear to sit idly by and see them all perish? We rely even more on boats to cross the waters. Now, the staff of the National Government's investigation and release office and various charitable organizations have joined our association to send personnel to rush to the scene and rescue them in various ways, while also distributing steamed food and setting up shelters in the city to accommodate them, preparing porridge kitchens, and arranging them separately to relieve them from the pain of drowning and to avoid the suffering of displacement. However, the vast area of hundreds of miles and the countless households mean that spring is approaching, and I fear that a drop in the bucket will not be able to remedy the situation. We implore all kind-hearted people to act with compassion and benevolence and quickly continue to issue large sums of money so that this continuous grant can save these suffering people. Life and death, flesh and bones, is what we hope for. The survivors of the disaster are anxious and cannot choose their words. We urgently send this appeal to the compassionate. We humbly beg your kind consideration and respectfully wish you peace and prosperity."</p>

<p>More than 30 loads of rice for porridge</p>
<p>More than 10,000 people eat porridge</p>
<p>The Zhabei Charity Group Porridge Kitchen, located at the Third Porridge Kitchen on Liuying Road, opened on January 15th. Every day from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM, the elderly, weak, women, and children in the area went to the kitchen to eat porridge. In the beginning, there were only a few thousand people, but the number increased daily, and now there are more than 10,000 people. Eight porridge stoves have been opened, and the amount of rice for porridge has increased to more than 30 loads. The kitchen is spacious and can accommodate many people. As winter passes and spring arrives, the weather is uncertain with rain and snow. Reed sheds have already been built with 250 units, and bamboo benches are placed inside for the women and children to rest after receiving porridge. In addition to hearing that directors Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and Jin Tingsun have each donated rice, it was recently heard that Director Lin Kanghou has raised 1,500 yuan in donations. Director Wang Binyan of the group is concerned that with so many people and so much porridge, the funds are extremely exhausted and may be difficult to maintain.</p>

<p>Xing Zhigang, the representative of the shipowners in Pudong, submitted a document to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "Presenting for falsely claiming a name, illegally forcing donations, urging the Social Affairs Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and Public Works Bureau to strictly investigate and uphold municipal affairs. Recently, it has been reported that the various shipowners at the South Assembly Hall, Dongjiadu, and Gongyi Wharf have reported that there are groups of three to five people loitering around the various harbors, holding leaflets, receipt books, and a bundle of small lead tags, forcibly collecting fees for tagging each ship at one yuan, arbitrarily coercing them. The ignorant shipowners, not knowing the truth, have been deceived. Upon inspection, the leaflets are in the name of the Shipping and Lighterage Industry Workers' United Benefit Association, stating that there are approximately 60,000 to 70,000 ships traveling to various places in the city, and in order to seek long-term benefits, they must quickly join the association, etc. The leaflets list as many as five offices, so the extent of their extortion can be imagined. It has been verified that the establishment of associations and gatherings is freely participated in by the same industry, and there is no reason for compulsory membership. Moreover, the name of the Workers' United Benefit Association violates the Public Association Law, and there is no compulsory fee for tagging. Moreover, the rural ships are ships for the convenience of the people, and their nature is completely different from that of the lighterage industry. How can they be forced to join? It is obviously intimidating the ignorant rural people, forcing donations under a false name, and harming the citizens, which is not trivial. Therefore, I am submitting the leaflets and receipts to your office, respectfully requesting your examination and approval, and immediately instructing the Social Affairs Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and Public Works Bureau to investigate the truth thoroughly and strictly and to benefit the shipping industry and uphold municipal affairs. It would be a great service."</p>

In order to meet the transportation needs, the company approved the extension of the special buses to the front of the station from 12:00 noon to 7:00 PM today to facilitate travel to the station for all sectors. The fares are divided into stations, except for the original schedule, but from the Baoshan Road intersection to the radio station, the one-way fare is 20 cents per passenger, and from Jinan University, the fare is 21 copper coins. It is also heard that if necessary in the future, the special buses will be extended further.</p>

<p>Newspaper Association held a meeting to discuss yesterday</p>
<p>Reporters Association scheduled to hold a meeting today</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai Business News was founded in October of the year before last. Manager Sun Mingqi and Editor-in-Chief Zhang Jiping. In addition to publishing domestic and foreign news on politics, military affairs, society, etc., the content also focuses on commercial news. It is recognized as the official gazette by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations. Since its publication, it has been developing daily. However, recently, the newspaper was suddenly sued by Ji Juemi for publishing news about the Xu Yuying case, and Editor-in-Chief Zhang Jiping was sentenced to imprisonment in the Special District Local Court, which caused a major reaction in the journalism community. The details of this matter are explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e169">Details of the Case <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>A young woman named Xu Yuying previously sued Ji Juemi, the chief steward of the Hardoon Garden, in the First Special District Local Court for the crime of seduction. At the beginning of the case, the Shanghai Business News received a contribution from outside and sent an outside reporter to investigate. It was confirmed that there was a lawsuit. Therefore, on December 4th of last year, the newspaper published the news truthfully without adding or subtracting anything. The next day, the newspaper received a letter from Ye Fokang representing Ji Juemi, strongly arguing that it was a fabrication. The newspaper published the original letter on the 7th. However, the original letter contained words such as "will definitely be prosecuted." The newspaper also added a brief reply. Ji Juemi then hired lawyer Xue Dubi and filed a defamation lawsuit against Sun Mingqi, the manager of the newspaper, and Zhang Jiping, the editor-in-chief, for damaging his reputation. At the same time, Sun Mingqi, who was not responsible for the editing, also hired lawyer Jiang Chiping and filed a counterclaim against Ji Juemi for false accusation because the main body of Ji Juemi's accusation was wrong.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Sentenced to Imprisonment <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The case was tried several times by Deng Baosun, the judge of the First Special District Local Court. Zhang Jiping also hired lawyer Jiang Chiping to defend him, stating that he published the information based on the submissions and did not add or subtract anything. He had never met Ji Juemi before and had no intention to do so. Therefore, he was not criminally liable under the law. The debate was declared closed at around 4:00 PM on the 25th of last month. The verdict was announced at 9:00 AM the next morning. Sun Mingqi was found not guilty. Ji Juemi was found not guilty on the counterclaim. Zhang Jiping was sentenced to four months of imprisonment, and the judgment was to be published in the Shen Bao and the Xin Bao.</p>

<p>After hearing the verdict, the newspaper considered it to be obviously biased and feared that if such a precedent were set, the future of the journalism industry would be unimaginable. Therefore, in addition to filing an appeal to seek legal relief, it has also reported the situation to the Newspaper Association and the Reporters Association, requesting them to uphold justice. After receiving the report, the Newspaper Association convened a meeting for discussion yesterday afternoon, and the Reporters Association is also scheduled to hold a meeting for discussion this afternoon. The newspaper issued a notice to all sectors yesterday, stating:</p>

<p>The World Red Swastika Society China Southeast Main Association Shanghai General Office yesterday called on the people in the disaster areas of Dongping and Dong'e to post advertisements for saving a life with five cents, and widely appealed to the disaster victims. In recent days, benevolent people from all walks of life have heard the news and donated money to the Society's office at No. 7 Danshui Road, which was remitted to the disaster area for immediate relief. Yesterday, it was heard that Mr. Guan Yuting and his wife personally sent 1,000 yuan, which they saved on food and clothing, to the Society's office and requested that it be immediately remitted to the disaster area to save the disaster victims. The Society has already done so. The enthusiasm and compassion of Mr. and Mrs. Guan are admirable.</p>

<p>A large crowd of Russians attended the hearing yesterday.</p>
<p>The mastermind, Mark, resorted to this scheme due to failing business.</p>
<p>｜Portuguese Consulate Has Arrested a Portuguese National Involved in the Case｜</p>
<p>The four Sino-Russian suspects involved in defrauding the Macallum Bank of over 130,000 yuan were brought to trial again yesterday afternoon. Qian Hongye, the Presiding Judge of the First Special District Court, presided over the criminal session. The Municipal Council's prosecuting lawyers, Ru Bao Yi and Li Zhi Shan, the defense lawyers for the accused, Fan Gang, Zhang Chong Ding, Wang Jian, and Mao Xian Shen, as well as the Italian national, Fei Si, were all present in court. Furthermore, the Russian expatriate community formed a very large and crowded gallery. First, Mr. Ru, the prosecuting lawyer, presented several witnesses and requested to question them one by one, because these witnesses each possessed considerable evidence pertinent to the case. Judge Qian then called to the stand a Russian named Ting Si Bo Er, who testified regarding:</p>
<h3 id="e174">False Check Copper Plates <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Before the fraudsters had the Japanese manufacture the plates, the first defendant, Jiao Sai Fu Ai A Ni, and an accomplice named Ka Sheng (who fled to Fengtian after the case broke, and whom the police have learned has been arrested in Fengtian and will soon be escorted to Shanghai) were tasked by Mark to have the company where Ting Si Bo Er worked manufacture the copper plates. Although they were produced, the defendant was not satisfied after taking them away, so he then troubled the Japanese to make them. The court then asked the first defendant about the witness's testimony, and the first defendant admitted it without denial, but claimed that he was acting on Mark's orders. After the plates were made, Mark deemed them unsuitable and sent someone else to entrust this work to the Japanese. Next, Feng You Liang, a printer from Lian Yi Printing House, was questioned about the printing of the false checks. According to him, the owner of Lian Yi, surnamed Yang, knew the fourth defendant, Xie Ping Feng. Around September of last year, Xie brought a copper plate of a Macallum Bank check and asked Yang to print sample copies, printing it four times in total. The first three times had flaws, and only the</p>
<h3 id="e175">Fourth Printing Was Satisfactory <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Xie said that he was entrusted by a foreigner, and that the foreigner agreed to give a printing fee of 500 yuan. A total of about a hundred sheets were printed. Feng also closely examined a sheet of the second forged check worth over 180,000 yuan that the defendants had made, saying that this sheet was printed by Lian Yi. The whereabouts of Mr. Yang are now unknown. When Xie Ping Feng was questioned about it, he admitted that Feng's account of the facts was correct, and that was the situation when he was in contact with Yang at the time. However, he stated that the copper plate and the lead type for printing the check numbers were given to him by Mark via the first defendant. The first defendant also admitted to giving the copper plate to Xie, but claimed that the checks printed by Xie were not satisfactory to Mark and were not used and were immediately torn up. The check used to defraud the bank and the two checks that were attempted but failed to defraud were actually printed by the Japanese. Next, Xie's younger brother, Xie Peng, was called to testify, stating that he opened:</p>
<h3 id="e176">De Xing Beef Shop <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The first defendant was a regular customer, so they had known each other for a long time. Ping Feng was his older brother, and Wang Chun Gan was a cousin. Since Wang was arrested, his older brother began to show signs of unease and told him that he was also fooled by foreigners. Only then did he know about this matter. His brother mentioned that he had collected 8,750 yuan from Guohua Bank on behalf of the first defendant, and the first defendant gave his brother 4,000 yuan, of which 1,000 yuan was the first defendant repaying old debts to him. His brother had spent over 1,000 yuan, and there was still over 1,900 yuan left, which he had already handed over to the police. His brother originally intended to surrender himself, but it was already too late, etc. When Xie Ping Feng was questioned about it, he confessed that after the first defendant handed him the check, he had Chen Mu Sheng, a worker at De Xing Shop, collect the money from Guohua Bank. After paying Chen a reward of one hundred yuan, he returned the remaining money to the first defendant. The defendant gave him a total of 4,000 yuan three times, and ordered him to transfer 2,000 yuan to Wang Chun Gan. In addition, he personally gave him 1,500 yuan, and then gave him another 1,500 yuan, but this sum was taken away by Ka Sheng on the spot. Chen Mu Sheng then testified that Xie gave him the check to</p>
<h3 id="e177">Cash at Guohua Bank <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>And received a reward of one hundred yuan. Furthermore, a Russian named Xie Le testified that between January 12th and 13th, he went to Mark's company and borrowed 150 yuan from the first defendant. The first defendant then gave him a check from the British American Tobacco Company, ordering him to withdraw 6,335 yuan from the Shanghai Bank and bring it back. When he handed it back to the first defendant, Mark was also present. The first defendant then gave him 300 yuan. Hearing this, the first defendant immediately said that the money paid to Xie Le at the time was 1,000 yuan. At this point, the prosecution's witnesses had all concluded their testimonies. Judge Qian then ordered the defendants to be separated, and only the first defendant, Jiao Bao Fu Ai A Ni, was brought in. He was first questioned about the amount of money the accomplices received after defrauding the bank of the large sum. According to his confession, Mark, as the leader, received the most, getting 46,000 yuan. He, Jiao, received 28,000 yuan. A Portuguese employee of Macallum Bank received 10,000 yuan, because he was</p>
<h3 id="e178">Spying on Internal Information <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>And was therefore rewarded. Mark's employee, surnamed Wu, received 9,800 yuan. An Italian father and son also shared the loot. The father, a close friend of Mark, received 5,300 yuan. The son, an employee of Mark, received 2,800 yuan. Another person who collected money from the bank also received a small sum. Ka Sheng received 6,300 yuan. Xie Ping Feng received 5,500 yuan. Wang Chun Gan received 4,500 yuan, or 5,500 yuan, he couldn't remember. Others who received money were not being questioned in this case, so the court did not pursue the matter, and the defendant also did not list them. Then, the defendant was ordered to give a consistent statement about the beginning and end of the fraud. According to him, his employer, Mark, resorted to this scheme because his business was failing and he was in financial difficulties, and at the beginning of the plan, he</p>
<h3 id="e179">Threatened Me to Assist <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The matter began around September of last year. He first discussed with me how to obtain the format of the British American Tobacco Company's check. I had already met Xie Ping Feng through introductions, and I also knew Wang Chun Gan, and knew that Wang worked at Macallum Bank. When I heard Mark's words, I told him that I would discuss it with Wang. Later, Wang came to my residence, and I asked Wang to find a British American Tobacco Company check that had already been cashed for Mark. Wang readily agreed. After ten days, he indeed obtained one. I gave it to Mark. At this time, Mark revealed his intention to counterfeit it, but I still did not tell Wang the purpose. Mark obtained the check, kept it for only one day, and then returned it, because during this day and night, he had Ka Sheng take</p>

<p>The preliminary plan was successful, and Mark rewarded Wang with 500 yuan, two sets of clothes, and a phonograph. Although there were two checks taken out of Macallum Bank, the other one was obtained by Mark himself. After taking the photos, the original plan was to have Da Zhonghua Printing House make the plates and counterfeit them, but the ones made were not suitable. Later, he repeatedly changed to other companies, but it was difficult to be satisfied. As a result, the Japanese finally made the plates and printed the false checks. All the procedures on the check were done by Mark himself, etc. At this point, the clock struck five. Judge Qian announced that the hearing would be adjourned until next Thursday afternoon. The defendants were still taken back to the police station for detention.</p>

<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that a Portuguese national named Ba Pu Di Si Tai, residing at No. 5, Lane 276, Gordon Road, who was working at the Macallum Bank in Shanghai, is related to the case of defrauding Macallum Bank of a large sum of money in the name of the British American Tobacco Company using false checks. This morning (2nd), the Portuguese Consul-General in Shanghai, Xue Er Fan, issued an arrest warrant, and the Municipal Council's General Police Department is expected to arrest him this afternoon. Mr. Ba has hired the Portuguese lawyer Lan Ge Er, who handled the suitcase murder case, to appear in court for him.</p>

<p>Zhou Zhan Yuan Directly Admitted to the Assassination of Li</p>
<p>Li's Body Was Taken to the International Funeral Parlor</p>
<p>Li Min Zhou, the Cantonese general manager of the New New Company on Nanjing Road, was shot in the abdomen by Zhou Zhan Yuan, a Dalian man who had been dismissed from his position as the general superintendent of the company, at 5 p.m. the day before yesterday. He died immediately. The murderer was also arrested. The details have already been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Detective Liu Xiang Zhai of the General Police Department, together with a foreign detective, escorted Zhou to the First Special District Court. Judge Feng Shi De presided over the trial. Lawyer Li Zhi Shan of the Police Department first stated the circumstances of the tragic case, saying that Zhou Zhan Yuan followed Li Min Zhou from the New New Company to room 327 of the New New Hotel. After shooting Li with a handgun, Li was wounded and exited the room, entering room 305, where he collapsed and died. The murderer then fled with the weapon, fleeing directly to the Guohua Bank on Beijing Road, intending to borrow travel expenses from the doorman No. 2139 of the bank to escape to Fengtian. At that time, the doorman had not yet started his shift, so the murderer waited until 8 p.m., when the doorman arrived, and then told him about the incident. Because the murderer was still wearing the New New uniform, the doorman ordered him to go to the eighth floor of the Guohua Building to change clothes. The doorman then reported to the General Police Department. The central and western detectives were immediately dispatched to arrest him. A handgun was found in his pocket. However, it was observed that there was a bullet stuck in the barrel, which has not yet been removed, so it cannot be presented as evidence to avoid danger. However, this murderer is so cruel, and should be tried in accordance with Article 264, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. Then Detective Liu reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendant. Zhou Zhan Yuan confessed that when Liu Xi Ji, the former general manager of New New, worked at Sincere Company, he was hired by Liu and had served for seven years. Later, Liu left Sincere and founded New New, and he also followed Liu to the New New preparation office, and borrowed 500 yuan to purchase one share of New New stock. It has been eight years, and the dividends received have far exceeded the interest on the debt, so the stock has already been mortgaged. His family's livelihood depends entirely on the 28 yuan monthly salary he earns as the general superintendent of New New. However, at 5 p.m. yesterday, General Manager Zhou summoned him to his office and suddenly ordered him to hand over the keys to all the doors under his management and dismissed him. He was terrified and asked him to announce his mistakes. He said that because he was old and weak, he replied that if he was too old to be the general superintendent, he asked him to change him to another job to avoid unemployment. But Li refused and turned to leave the room. He also followed out to the room, then he knelt on the ground to beg, Li still refused, and went to the New New Hotel. He went there again. When they arrived in room 327, Li was undressing and was about to take a bath. He then knelt down for the third time, and when Li saw this, he suddenly turned his body around. At this time, he was filled with anger and did not have time to consider the consequences. He reached into the pocket of his uniform and pulled out the handgun and fired a shot, whether it hit him or not, he did not.</p>

The excellence of the program, the number of guests, and the quality of the order were even more advanced than the one held by the association at Yiyuan last year. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Attendees <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>

<p>After the opening of the ball, President Kong Xiang Xi gave a speech saying that the purpose of holding the charity ball was to enable participating men and women to obtain legitimate entertainment and achieve the goal of child welfare in an intangible way. This time, thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of the ball committee and the participation of people from all walks of life, not only is the child welfare cause infinitely promising, but the happiness of everyone is also as high as the mountains and as long as the river.</p>
<h3 id="e186">General Program <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The most outstanding of this program was the Chinese and Western costume show. The Chinese costumes ranged from the White Snake Maiden to Xi Shi, Zhao Jun, Dong Fan, Yang Guifei, Mulan, Lin Daiyu, and Thirteenth Sister, as well as from the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China to the present day. Each costume was played by a famous lady, and the posture and actions were consistent with the lives of women of that era, and were compared with each other, and the differences were obvious. Finally, Ms. Tang Ying, dressed as a Qing Dynasty singer, sang a Shanghai opera song and then the whole group gathered and walked around in a circle. The old and new were mixed together, and in contrast, it was felt that the older and newer were very moving. Only the slim pants and long shirts of ten years ago, and the short shirts and long skirts of five years ago, could not help but show their ugliness in comparison, which made people laugh. The Western costume show started with the crown of the Egyptian king four hundred years before the Gregorian calendar, followed by Greek Athens Women's Costumes, Renaissance Costumes, 16th Century British Costumes, Charles I Era Costumes, Valley Screen Women's Costumes, Louis XV Era French Queen Costumes, 18th Century Russian Queen Costumes, American Colonial Representative, Napoleon III Era Costumes, until modern Women's Costumes, a total of twenty-one kinds of Shen. Coupled with the ancient Western harpsichord solo of Ms. Lai Kai Mi, a famous French lady of the 19th century, the sound and color were dazzling, and the whole hall was tense. The second was Ms. Lin Xue Fang's performance of Daiyu Burying Flowers, with clear singing and graceful posture, which won thunderous applause.</p>

<p>The French Concession Public Welfare Charity Association of Shanghai donated funds to the China Child Welfare Association, saying that the Minister of Finance and President of the China Child Welfare Association, had sent a letter to the French Consul-General, reporting the purpose and organizational content of the Child Welfare Association, which is to rescue children, seek legal treatment and medical and health affairs for them, and receive abandoned babies for adoption or apprenticeship, etc. Now, after the French Consul-General forwarded the previous letter, the Association expressed its extreme sympathy for these charitable undertakings and should support them. Now is the time for the Association to open a fair, and it is specially presenting 5,000 yuan in silver dollars to express its respect, and entrusting it to be recorded in 1934, and will continue to donate 1,000 yuan in silver dollars. According to the letter from Minister Kong, this thousand yuan should be enough to cover the cost of rescuing ten children for one year. Then the child's head was carried to the Fei Lun Road autopsy room. Yesterday morning, it was reported to the First Special District Court, and Prosecutor Guo Hui, together with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, court clerk Wang Zuyi, etc., were appointed to visit the room to examine the child's head and inquire about the investigation process of the detectives. Mr. Guo, following the instructions, found an anonymous head, which was indeed cut off after dying from illness during his lifetime and handed over to the Shanshanzhuang for burial. According to the above incident, there have been several cases discovered in Shanghai. They are all superstitious people who, because their children died not long after birth, wanted to be able to raise them in the future, so they cut off the heads of the dead children, or used this to seek flower club use.</p>

<p>Falsely Claiming Household Registration Donation and Collecting Two Horns Per Household</p>
<p>The Third Office of the First District Has Issued a Notice to Pay Attention to Residents</p>
<p>Recently, young men with fanciful ideas, wearing luxurious clothes, carrying black leather bags, and resembling civil servants, have been collecting household registration donations from shops and residents in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas, at two horns per household, and issuing receipts printed with the words "Household Registration Office of the Police Department of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau" and stamped with a picture stamp with the words "Two Horns in Silver Dollars". They claimed to be employees of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. This household registration donation was recently created by the Municipal Public Security Bureau and approved by the Municipal Government, and stipulates that all households, regardless of size, residing in this city must pay this donation of two horns in silver dollars. If they dare to resist and refuse to pay, they will be severely punished by the Bureau. Therefore, the shops and residents did not investigate deeply because the amount was small and paid the money as required, so that in a few days, thousands of shops and residents in the north and south markets were defrauded. It was not until yesterday morning that the matter was heard by Jin Dianyang, the director of the Third Office of the First District, who stated that the Municipal Public Security Bureau had not created this household registration donation and sent personnel to collect it. It was clear that the young men were inventing names and defrauding people of money, which was extremely illegal. Therefore, in addition to ordering his subordinates to investigate, he also issued a notice as follows: Notice to all residents, it has been found that unscrupulous people have recently falsely claimed the name of the Household Registration Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and have been collecting festival fees from door to door, collecting two horns in silver dollars per household. These unscrupulous people dare to defraud people of money, which is extremely illegal. In addition to this office strictly investigating and severely punishing them, all residents should be aware of this and not be deceived. If you encounter the above situation, immediately hand them over to the nearby police post and take them to the office for strict handling.</p>

<p>Director of the Jiaxing Grain Collection Office</p>
<p>Embezzled More Than 40,000 Yuan in Public Funds</p>
<p>Gao Yuchun, a native of Jiaxing, was the director of the Grain Collection Office of the Jiaxing Finance Bureau. He was suspected of embezzling more than 40,000 yuan in public funds and abandoning his post to flee. The director of the bureau found out and asked the local authorities to pay attention to the investigation. Director Wang learned that Gao was hiding at No. 58, Lane 351, Hart Road, Shanghai, and sent a letter to the county government to transfer the case to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and request the First Special District Court to issue an arrest warrant. At 6:30 a.m. the day before yesterday, the Jing'an Temple Police Station was ordered to send Chinese and Western detectives, together with Gu Liancheng and Hu Guisheng, detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, to secretly arrest him at the address. However, Gao Yuchun had already heard the news and fled. Only his son, Gao Anke, lived in the house. The police station, based on the report of the detectives of the Public Security Bureau, said that Gao Anke was also involved, so they asked the First Special Court to issue an arrest warrant for Gao Anke, arrested Gao, and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the case and asked for instructions. Then Wu Jinsheng, an employee of the Jiaxing Finance Bureau, reported that the defendant's father, Gao Yuchun, had embezzled more than 40,000 yuan in public funds and fled, so he was ordered to be investigated. Since Gao Yuchun had already heard the news and fled far away, his son Gao Anke was arrested, because his father had embezzled state public funds, his son should be held responsible, etc. When Gao Anke was questioned, he confessed that he had been working in the advertising business in the newspaper office and had been in Shanghai for 13 years. He did not know where his father, Gao Yuchun, currently lived. His mother and others were all in the countryside in Jiaxing, and he knew nothing about what his father had done. Judge Xue Zhonghe reviewed the confession and ordered Gao Anke to be released on bail pending trial.</p>

<p>The Facts of the Case Are Clear, How Can They Rely on Sophistry</p>
<p>The Court Sentences Each to Ten Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Yang Junhao, also known as Wensheng, a 29-year-old man from Tangqiao, Pudong, originally worked in the pawnshop business. In the spring and summer of the year before last, because he was unemployed and destitute, he was taken in by his friend Zhang Guilin, a local resident of No. 18 Yongyu Lane, Beile Road, French Concession. Unexpectedly, Yang became lustful and repaid kindness with hatred. In June of that year, while Zhang was in Beijing seeking a job, he seduced Zhang's wife, Qin, into adultery. After Zhang returned home, his eldest daughter, Jinfeng, told him what had happened, and Zhang drove Yang out, forbidding him from entering his house and severing contact. However, Yang secretly instigated Qin to run away and live with him at No. 72 Ronghua Lane, Malan Road, living together like husband and wife. Zhang found out and reported to the patrol, which sent detectives to arrest them. Yang happened to be out, so only Qin was arrested. Qin confessed her guilt to her husband, begged for forgiveness, and vowed not to associate with Yang again, begging to be spared from investigation. Zhang, seeing that his wife had realized her mistake, agreed and asked the patrol chief to spare her from further investigation. After taking her back, Qin and Yang's adulterous affair continued passionately, and soon she often brought her five-year-old daughter, Jinxia, to Yang's small room in the pavilion at No. 687 Malan Road for adulterous trysts, and ordered the girl to call Yang "Daddy." Later, the girl told her father, and Zhang called the 350th patrol and rushed to catch them in the act, dragging Qin and Yang out of bed and taking them to the patrol, who sent them to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. The interrogation and investigation details have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday, Judge Qiu continued the interrogation in Criminal Court No. 8. The patrol lawyer Chen Ming explained the case and the investigation process.

<p>Huang Zicheng, an inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Inspectorate, married Jiang, a 37-year-old woman from Tianjin. They lived together in Yujia Lane, Xiaonanmen. Recently, Huang was introduced to a female entertainer who sang in Xiao Guanghan on the Qinglian Pavilion on Fourth Horse Road by a team leader nicknamed Zhang Dagu, one of his colleagues. As a result, he became infatuated with the new and tired of the old, and planned to divorce his wife Jiang and marry the female entertainer. Unexpectedly, the matter was revealed to Jiang, and in her resentment, she had the idea of committing suicide. On the 29th of last month, after swallowing opium with wine, she rushed to Zhang Dagu's house to negotiate and questioned Huang about his affair, claiming that if she died, she would not let Zhang pass through the door even in the underworld. At that time, bystanders saw that her face was pale and her breathing was short, and they knew that something was wrong. They quickly sent her to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. However, due to the excessive amount of poison she had taken, the treatment was ineffective. The dangerous period continued until about 6:00 AM the next morning (the 30th), and Huang's family transferred her to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, the treatment was still ineffective, and she died at about 6:00 AM yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Principal Wang Suben of the Private Minli Girls' High School Resigns Due to Accepting Responsibility</p>
<p>The Board of Directors Has Already Been Automatically Reorganized</p>
<p>A New Principal Will Be Elected at Today's Meeting</p>
<p>The Private Minli Girls' High School in this city, since Secretary Wang Dazao organized a drama club and propagated communism, leading to his arrest by the Garrison Headquarters, Principal Wang Suben has resigned due to accepting responsibility. The Board of Directors has also been automatically reorganized. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Principal Has Resigned</p>
<p>Wang Suben has served as the principal of the school since its founding over twenty years ago. He has been able to manage school affairs adequately. In recent years, due to age and declining strength, he has repeatedly expressed his intention to resign to the Board of Directors, but it was not approved. Several days ago, after the school's secretary, Wang Dazao, was arrested by the Garrison Headquarters for propagating communism at the request of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Principal Wang took responsibility for his oversight and expressed his retirement. He has formally submitted his resignation to the Board of Directors, which was promptly approved. However, in recognition of his years of service in education, a reward will be considered as a form of commemoration.</p>
<p>Reorganization of the Board of Directors</p>
<p>Since Wang Dazao's arrest, the Municipal Bureau of Education, following a letter from the Municipal Party Headquarters, ordered the school's Board of Directors to reorganize itself to bring about a fresh start. It was decided to automatically reorganize. A meeting of the Board of Directors was held at the East Asia Restaurant the other day, where it was decided to comply with the order to reorganize. Tong Xingbai, Liu Yazi, Wang Yansong, Wu Xingya, Qian Xinzhi, Yang Weiyu, Huang Xianggu, Zhu Xuefan, Cai Hongtian, Tang Subennan, Wang Yiting, Zhu Yinong, Zhu Xiangwan, Chen Jicheng, and Su Yingjie were elected as the fifteen new directors. It is reported that the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Ye Hongying, has already submitted a report on the automatic reorganization to the Municipal Bureau of Education, stating that Principal Wang Suben has resigned and that a new principal will be elected soon. The Municipal Bureau of Education immediately approved the report and ordered the convening of the first meeting of the reorganized Board of Directors to elect a principal to take over and reorganize the school, and to issue appointment letters. The first meeting of the reorganized Board of Directors will be held at the school on Xiaoximen today (the 3rd) at 5:00 PM.</p>

However, because Pudong High School had the highest number of students passing the high school graduation examination this year, and Pudong students won first and third place in the awards, and because Pudong High School also won the cross-country championship and the soccer championship this year, the number of applicants for the second round is still very high.

From the principal to the staff, they work from 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM without rest.

<p>| A 1-1 Tie with Qinghua in the Second Match in Beiping |</p>
<p>A 0-0 Tie with Beining Yesterday in Tianjin</p>
<p>Match with the Tianjin Chinese Team Tomorrow</p>
<p>(Tianjin, 1st) The Shanghai Jiaotong University soccer team, consisting of sixteen people, arrived in Tianjin from Beiping on the 1st. The Beining Sports Association hosted a banquet. The team played against the Beining team at the Beining Stadium on the 2nd and will play against the Chinese team on the 3rd. The order of matches for the remaining teams has not been determined.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 2nd Special Dispatch: The Shanghai Jiaotong University soccer team played against the Beining team at the Beining Stadium at 3:30 PM on the 2nd. There were a thousand spectators.

The Jiaotong University vs. Tianjin Chinese team soccer match is scheduled for 4:30 PM on the 4th at the Nankai Stadium.</p>
<p>Heading to the Tsinghua Garden</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jiaotong University soccer team went on a northern expedition to Beiping. In the first match against Furen, they unfortunately lost. On the 30th, they met the Tsinghua University soccer team. The time was 2:30 PM, and the location was Tsinghua Garden. The referee was still Wang Zhensheng. The Tsinghua team has many veterans from the North China soccer world, including goalkeeper Zhao Yansheng, defender Xiao Difei, and center forward Huang Zhongfu, all of whom are famous players. Although the Jiaotong University team unfortunately lost to Furen in the first match, they were even more careful in this match.</p>
<p>The Big Battle Begins</p>
<p>After the kickoff, the Jiaotong University team immediately launched an attack with short passes, with a fierce momentum. The Tsinghua players were not without resistance, and they bravely fought back. The small ball changed direction and was fiercely shot towards the Jiaotong University goal. Fortunately, goalkeeper Fan Jiaju was quick on his feet and saved the goal. Afterwards, both sides had excellent performances.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University Takes the Lead</p>
<p>Jiaotong University forward Wan Xianghua received a pass but was kicked out of bounds by Xiao Difei. The Tsinghua defense was on the verge of collapse. Amidst the stampede, the Tsinghua defender was penalized with a twelve-yard penalty kick. With a flick of Ji Guangzhong's foot, Zhao Yansheng, despite his experience, was helpless. After the kickoff again, there was a lot of contention, but there were no results. In the first half, Jiaotong University took the lead with a score of 1-0.</p>
<p>Tsinghua's Last-Ditch Effort</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, Tsinghua changed their offensive strategy after being instructed by Old Man Ma, using the left side to advance. Xiong Dazhen had great ambition and intended to take revenge. Receiving a supply from the rear, he immediately spurred his horse and galloped towards the Jiaotong University base camp. Old Cow Huang Zhongfu saw an opportunity and charged forward from the center.</p>
<p>1-1 Draw</p>
<p>Xiong Dazhen passed the ball and shot hard, and the ball responded as desired, much to the delight of the surrounding spectators, who felt even better than taking a soothing pill. Time was unforgiving, and the battle time had arrived in an instant. The result was 1-1, with both sides drawing. The lineups of the two armies are on the left:</p>
<p>▲ Jiaotong University</p>
<p>Fan Jiaju</p>

<p>Today, the Three Chinese Teams of the West Football Association All Meet Strong Opponents</p>
<p>▲ Donghua vs. French Business Association at the Chinese Baseball Field</p>
<p>▲ Youyou vs. Huacesi at the Shen Garden Soccer Field</p>
<p>▲ Jinan vs. West Business Association at the Yi Garden Dog Racing Track</p>
<p>The Absence of Li Ning and Wan Xianghua of Donghua Has a Significant Impact</p>
<p>All three Chinese teams of the West Football Association's Group A are playing today, and their opponents are all strong. Youyou meets Huacesi at Shen Garden, Donghua plays the French Business Association at the baseball field, and Jinan plays the West Business Association at Yi Garden. All matches start at 3:00 PM. Such good matches, but the weather suddenly turned cold last night, which is a bit of a disappointment. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Competing Teams, Group, Venue, Referee</p>
<p>Donghua vs. French Business Association, Group A, Chinese Baseball Field, Lunner</p>
<p>Youyou vs. Huacesi, Group A, Shen Garden Soccer Field, Pachu</p>
<p>Jinan vs. French Business Association, Group A, Yi Garden Dog Racing Track, Lennox</p>
<p>West Capture vs. British Navy, Group A, Racecourse Field, Hall</p>
<p>French Business Association's Two Failures Make It Difficult to Secure the Group A Championship</p>
<p>The French Business Association, which had nine wins in nine matches in the first cycle of the West Football Association's Group A, has recently suffered consecutive defeats. First, they lost 1-2 to West Capture, and then they lost 2-4 to Huacesi, indirectly giving Donghua a chance to win the championship. Donghua currently has one draw and three losses, and Donghua's meeting with the French Business Association today is a very good opportunity to "recover." If Donghua can defeat the French Business Association again, making the French Business Association also lose three times, they will only have one more point than Donghua. If another team can defeat the French Business Association again, Donghua can compete for the throne. West Capture has three draws and two losses, and Youyou has one draw and three losses, so they are all in the same position. Therefore, if Donghua wins against the French Business Association, they will also indirectly give West Capture and Youyou a chance to compete for the championship. However, if things proceed according to this ideal, Donghua will have the highest chance of winning the championship.</p>
<p>The Absence of Donghua's Generals Increases Hope and Then Reduces It Again</p>
<p>However, the weather is unpredictable, and fortune and misfortune are uncertain. It is a pity that Donghua cannot take advantage of this only opportunity at this critical moment. It is well known that Li Ning and Wan Xianghua are the souls of Donghua's front and back lines. Now that they cannot play and there are no substantial substitutes, the reporter specifically asked the team manager last night who would replace them. According to reports, they have not yet found suitable talent and must make a decision at the last minute. The sigh of difficult talent is precarious, and the opportunity created by others will be given away again.</p>
<p>Jinan's Position Is Also Good, but Unfortunately, Its Generals Have Returned Home</p>
<p>Youyou and Jinan also have three losses and one draw, which is the same situation as Donghua. Moreover, Youyou has already met the French Business Association twice, and the subsequent schedule is slightly easier, so the team is very hopeful that Donghua will defeat the French Business Association. However, in any case, the team's future is still optimistic. They hope to do their best in today's match against Huacesi and win by surprise. Jinan's strength has plummeted due to the return of its main players Gu Shangxiang, Xu Heng, and Chen Zhenxiang to their hometowns. It is feared that its position of one draw and three losses and four wins will be difficult to maintain. The recent results of each team are recorded below:</p>
<p>Team Name, Matches Played, Wins, Draws, Losses, Goals For, Goals Against, Points</p>
<p>Huacesi, 15, 11, 4, 72, 20, 21</p>
<p>French Business Association, 12, 10, 0, 2, 73, 21, 20</p>
<p>West Capture, 10, 5, 3, 2, 26, 18, 13</p>
<p>Lakesi, 9, 5, 0, 4, 38, 31, 10</p>
<p>Jinan, 8, 4, 1, 3, 14, 19, 9</p>
<p>Youyou Association, 8, 4, 1, 3, 27, 40, 9</p>
<p>Sukur, 10, 4, 0, 6, 23, 46, 8</p>
<p>Donghua Association, 7, 3, 1, 3, 13, 11, 7</p>
<p>West Business Association, 11, 1, 1, 9, 17, 53, 3</p>
<p>British Navy, 11, 1, 0, 10, 15, 49, 2</p>
<p>Donghua's Empty Reserves Lead to a Sigh of Difficult Talent</p>
<p>Who will replace Li Ning and Wan Xianghua's positions at Donghua must be decided on the spot. However, based on ideal speculation, Feng Yunyou can replace Li's position, Tu Kaiyuan can replace Feng's position, and Feng Nianhan can replace Tu as the left forward, which is relatively competent. However, Wan's position is extremely difficult. To deal with the situation, Chen Hongguang can replace Wan, and Chen Yutian and Hongguang can be the right inside forward, which is not impossible. Today's lineups of the three Chinese teams and their opponents are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Youyou Lineup</p>
<p>Tang Yongchun</p>
<p>Lu Zhiming, Jiang Shanjing</p>
<p>Liang Shutang, Huang Ruihua, Chen Jiaqiu</p>

<p>▲ Eagle Team Defeats Artillery Team | 51-33</p>
<p>▲ Tongji Defeats Qingguang | 42-22</p>
<p>| Three Group A Matches Tonight |</p>
<p>The results of the Shanghai Basketball Association's matches last night were as follows: In Group A, the Eagle Team defeated the Artillery Team 51-33, and Tongji defeated Qingguang 42-22. In Group B, Quan Hei defeated Tu Jin 48-16. All three matches were one-sided. In the Eagle vs. Artillery match, the Artillery Team scored three points first with three successful free throws. However, the Eagles showed their power, and after 6-3, the Artillery Team was trapped and had no room to maneuver. The score was 24-9 in the first half. The Artillery Team showed some improvement in the second half, but they had lost too much ground in the previous half, making it difficult to recover. In the end, the Eagle Team won 51-33. In the Tongji vs. Qingguang match, Qingguang was weak, but they also struggled bravely, with scores of 2-2 and 8-8. Tongji was better connected and won the first half 18-10. In the second half, Qingguang launched a full-scale counterattack, once chasing the score to 23-22, only one point behind. However, their scoring stopped again, while Tongji continued to rise, and the result was 42-22, with Tongji winning. The Group B match between Quan Hei and Tu Jin was all about Quan Hei.

<p>The issue of settlement price changes for spot gold, delayed the market opening</p>
<p>Continued to rise by six dollars and ninety cents after twists and turns</p>
<p>Recently, the United States has reduced the gold content in its currency and changed the value of the US dollar to 5906. The US President has announced that this will be implemented on February 1st, hence changes should be made to spot gold settlement prices. This will be handled according to Article 47 of the Gold Exchange's operating rules. However, brokers believe that the exchange's announcement was too late, only being released after the market closed on February 1st. As such, many in the industry were unaware, resulting in unsettled transactions. Moreover, short sellers believed the settlement price change was unfavorable to them, leading to queries with the exchange authorities. As there were no results at the time, no one was willing to trade, resulting in a market uproar. After an emergency meeting and debate between the exchange authorities and the brokers' association, an understanding was reached, and the market reopened as usual in the afternoon. The exchange's announcement is recorded below: Reuters telegrams from various parties this month confirm that the United States has announced a reduction in the weight of the existing currency system. All spot gold transactions for February and March that have already been concluded should be handled in accordance with the exchange's operating rules, using the initial HSBC exchange rate quoted on January 31st of last month as the standard. It was found that HSBC quoted one shilling four pence one two five on that day, and the US exchange rate was thirty-three yuan and fifty cents, equivalent to an Anglo-American exchange rate of 498605. For the end of February and the end of March, the initial HSBC exchange rate will be used, calculated at 498605, with the US exchange rate still calculated at two hundred and forty yuan, equivalent to one tael of spot gold. Before the end of the expiration date, trading will continue as usual. Besides notifying the brokers' association, this is a special announcement. Furthermore, no swaps will be held in March in order to clear the settlement price. However, a decision will be made after another meeting in April. The market situation yesterday afternoon started strong but then softened, with many twists and turns. The will of the traders was hesitant, so prices fluctuated greatly. This unexpected change in events. The highest price was 713 yuan and 80 cents, and the lowest was 706 yuan and 60 cents, a difference of 7 yuan and 20 cents. Most of the long and short positions were squared off, and the market ended up rising 6 yuan and 90 cents. The market opened up 9 yuan and 90 cents from opening, totaling 711 yuan and 70 cents. The spot and forward silver markets both fell, and the exchange rates for British pounds and US dollars both dropped by half a cent and five cents respectively, which stimulated the Shanghai market. Trading began before the market opened, with initial quotes of sixteen to seventeen yuan. The Dalian gang, Wanxing, first bought more than one hundred taels, and then, due to the unloading of Hengyu, Dachangxiang, Hengtai, and sporadic long positions, the price plummeted by more than ten yuan, reaching the level of 06 yuan. It then rose again to more than 12 yuan when the market opened. Goods opened at 11 yuan and 30 cents. After opening, Hengxing, Dafa, Yongyifeng, Yongda, the Dalian gang, etc. all went in, and as the exchange rate for drafts continued to strengthen, Mitsui absorbed 6875 for June US dollars, and then added up to 13 yuan and 80 cents. Unexpectedly, Hengyu, Xie Xing, Yong, etc. came to sell, and the price immediately depreciated to 09 yuan. Bingxing and Shenkang came in, adding slightly more than one yuan, totaling 10 yuan and 30 cents. After 2:20 PM, the exchange rate for drafts loosened, and major players on the floor dumped. It is estimated that Dachangxiang, Hengxing, Yuan Zhifeng, Yong, and a certain speculator sold a large amount. By 3:00 PM, the May US dollar could be settled at 8125, and then at 3:30 PM it was 06 yuan and 60 cents. Afterwards, Hengyu, Zhifeng, Yong, and Fuyu all went in again. At 4:00 PM, it was 09 yuan and 70 cents, and then fluctuated around 09 yuan. When the market closed at 4:30 PM, it was 08 yuan and 70 cents (goods were auctioned at 8 yuan and 60 cents). Afterward, trading continued in the 9 yuan range. Hengyu and Wanxing bought in, while Dachangxiang continued to sell. Spot gold was at 1,130 yuan, with limited trading. Decorative gold increased by another 2 yuan, totaling 116 yuan.</p>
<p>Quoted prices are now based on the Anglo-American exchange rate calculated at 498605. Yesterday, the British gold rate was one shilling and four pence (plus two pence), using one shilling and six pence as a multiplier, and then using 240 as a divisor, which is equivalent to 33 yuan and 25 US dollars, approximately 722 yuan. Initially, there was a premium of around 10 yuan, and then around 14 yuan, which was about 3 yuan less than the previous day. The registration fee was 23 yuan for February and 09 yuan for March, with a water supplement of 23 yuan.</p>
<p>Floor transactions varied. Short covering was very strong. According to statistics, Bingxing, Dafa Yong, Shenkang, Yuan Maoyong, Ruikang, Yuanchun, Sida, Yuanxing Yong, and Shunli all went in. Dachangxiang sold more than 2,000 taels (sold off), Zhifeng Yong, Yifeng Yong, Futai Heng, Hengtai, Hengxing Yuan, and a Mr. Lu all sold. It was heard that a Mr. Wu sold a huge amount through a certain firm. Fuyu and Hengyu went out and then in again. The rest was complicated, but not in large quantities. The Dalian gang bought and sold more than 2,000 taels in total. There were still exchange rate hedges. The Guang Gang Hengxing slightly entered 2-300 taels. The quota of each firm in March was reduced by another 3,800 taels, totaling 35,427 taels.</p>
<p>US Exchange Inner Market Tight</p>
<p>Various Firms Grabbed More Than 1.6 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market and exchange rates were reported to have fallen. The foreign exchange market in this port was unusually tight, both openly and secretly. It was also rumored that the United States was planning to restore the gold standard. HSBC's exchange rate for the British pound was reduced by 125, and the US dollar was reduced by 25. Hong Kong was as before, and the rest were further reduced. However, there were slight changes in the inner market. The British gold rate was reduced by 0625, and the gold shops slightly increased their rates. Various banks did some mutual trading, totaling about 100,000 pounds. The US dollar strengthened from 375 to 3125, and then continued to tighten. It is estimated that the industry grabbed June from 34 yuan 125 to 33 yuan 8125, and May from 34 yuan to 33 yuan 6875. However, because the spot gold market was closed, the exchange market was even tighter in secret. The afternoon session started strong, and banks absorbed June from 8125 to 6875. The gold market has already resumed normal operations. Later, banks had a selling intention, which led to a loosening of the market. (The opening and closing prices on that day were reduced by 125 to 3115.) The swap market rebounded again in the afternoon, with a difference of half a yuan between February and June. The result was a reduction of half a yuan compared to the previous period, with June at 625. Various firms fiercely grabbed more than one million yuan in the morning session, and continued to grab 600,000 yuan in the afternoon, mainly to cash out gold. Sassoon slightly sold in the morning, while the Central Exchange Bureau entered in the afternoon. The total turnover for the day was more than one million. The French exchange rate was increased for June, but not significantly. The transaction prices are recorded below.</p>

<p>Various Securities Firms Seemed to Have Contracted</p>
<p>The Bond Market Circulated and Tended to Be Stagnant</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange turned from circulating to stagnant. Major players did not enter or exit the market at all, and trading suddenly felt idle. Because the Lunar New Year was approaching, new transactions were extremely rare. Besides a few settlements and swaps that slightly entered and exited the market, speculators were temporarily dormant, and those with slightly thicker capital were waiting and watching for changes, thus forming a stalemate. It was heard that the market would be closed starting next Saturday, with about nine days of holiday including the week. Therefore, those who were floating long or short positions would have to swap or settle within the next five days. It was predicted that there would only be four days of trading left in February after the Lunar New Year. If most people wanted to postpone the settlement or swap until the deadline, the turmoil would be great. The market price yesterday went through circulation and stagnation, and there was nothing to describe. The overall trend was weak. From morning to night, each session had different and abnormal states of ups and downs, and the fluctuations were only around 5 fen and 1 jiao. The morale of the market was lax, and there were few transactions. It seemed that various firms were contracting. The result of the market price was that it was slightly more than 5 fen and 1 jiao and as high as 3 jiao and a half, while the 18th Customs Compilation and Dismissal and the 19th Customs Compilation were slightly better by 5 fen to 1-2 jiao. The total transaction volume was 6,869,000 yuan, including 4,000 yuan in spot goods, 2,930,000 in total salt tax futures, 710,000 in demobilization, 595,000 in the 19th Customs Welfare, 775,000 in the 20th Cigarette Customs, 645,000 in the Golden Short Whole 6, and 920,000 in the 96th Issue, while the rest ranged from 3-40,000 to 12-130,000.</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Rises to a Peak</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report: On the 1st, the New York stock market opened very strong, and several stocks rose sharply. Afterwards, more and more bulls settled their positions, and the market rebounded. Before the close, department store stocks suddenly turned higher, and each stock also rebounded. The result was that it was better than the previous day by 1-2 yuan. Bond prices rose particularly sharply, and several bonds rose by as much as 7 yuan. The smoothness of the transactions was also unprecedented. It is estimated that the devaluation of the US dollar will be temporarily stable. The total transaction volume for the day was 4,710,000 shares. Wheat had some scattered absorption. The gold price failed to trigger purchases. The news was favorable to the bulls. You can buy when it falls. Cotton had large-scale sales at the opening, making it difficult to rise and causing the bulls to sell in disappointment. The government dumped at the close, but the position was not weak. Private reports of reduced planting continued to be good, and the government clearly approved of the automatic plan. Spot demand has improved relatively. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton Flower Markets Trend Higher, Led by Yarn</p>
<p>The yarn market showed a slightly calm state. Because raw cotton tended to rise, the yarn market was led higher. However, no large-scale development was seen in the current yarn sales market, and people's hearts were still calm. Some people said that the yarn stored in the warehouse was gradually decreasing, and they were also wary of short selling. Also, because the lunar new year was approaching, transactions were still dull.</p>
<p>Cotton Flower Bidding Market Steadily Firm</p>
<p>The cotton flower bidding market opened in the morning, and because US cotton was stable and Indian cotton rose sharply, the morale was slightly tight. Each month rose by 1-2 jiao. The market in the afternoon was flat again, and there were not many buyers. Each month did not fluctuate much. The total transaction volume for the day was 2,800 bales. It was found that Yongchang sold 400 bales, Yuanda 200 bales, Yichang 250 bales, and Yuanda 250 bales.

<p>The Cotton Market Tended to Be Firm, and the Situation Became Harder</p>
<p>Because US cotton was calm and the US dollar was stable, and it was being announced, the gold price rose, exchange rates tended to shrink, and there was a lack of Indian cotton, the market situation suddenly turned firm. However, Yuanda still sold out. The current cotton demand was sluggish, and each factory still had no import volume. The cotton market was judged based on foreign cotton, and it was difficult to look down on.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Rose Two and a Half Jiao</p>
<p>The Zheng Biao market opened in the morning, with foreign cotton stable, and each month rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao. It was heard in the afternoon that the gold price had risen, and buying began again. Each month rose by 1-2 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 31,100 dan.

<p>Total 636,700</p>
<p>April 4255 25 172,500</p>
<p>Factory Demand Only Absolute</p>
<p>Current cotton consumption was quite sluggish, and each factory had no import interest, so there was no transaction. The source was estimated to be 473 bales of Yao Hua and 709 bales of Tong Hua.</p>
<p>Japanese Factories Gradually Increase Yarn Stockpiles</p>
<p>According to Shanghai Japanese cotton industry news, although the Fujian issue has come to an end, the approaching lunar new year and the financial pressure have made the actual demand in various places still sluggish. The market price has a gradual downward trend. On the one hand, after the Japanese Textile Federation withdrew its decision not to buy Indian cotton, it was predicted that the market price would tend to rise. US cotton also has the hope of establishing a production reduction, and it has risen to the 50 yuan level. As the situation resolves, Chinese cotton may follow foreign cotton and rise together. Therefore, Japanese factories in Shanghai are currently operating at full capacity, which will be disadvantageous. It was found that the yarn inventory at the end of last month was 15,685 bales, and it is feared that the yarn inventory statistics at the end of this month will exceed 20,000 bales. In the event of a deterioration of the situation, the warehouses will not have the capacity to accommodate them. Then, in April, some Japanese yarn factories may have to reduce their work.</p>
<p>US Cotton is Strong and Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was initially strong and active because the political news was favorable to the bulls. Afterwards, it fell back due to the settlement of some bulls. As a result, the spot price did not move, and the futures rose by 2 to 6 pounds. The spot price of Liverpool cotton rose by 8 points, and the futures rose by 10 to 11 points. The spot price of Egyptian cotton rose by 4 points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to speculator purchases and short covering. As a result, Pingar rose by 1 rupee and 7 and a half corners, Aumla rose by 3 and a half rupees, and Bairakhi rose by 4 rupees and 2 and a half corners. The original telegram is recorded on the left (1st Telegraph).</p>

<p>The Flour Bidding Market Had Larger Buying Forces</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was characterized by step-by-step construction in both the upper and lower markets. Because there were not many days left in the year, most factories stopped selling short. That is, even the current flour was unwilling to sell at a low price. The market has been rejected. However, scattered households in Beiyang and Tianjin needed to organize for the end of the year, and they would also absorb the far-month standard. Therefore, short covering and new hoarding and purchases were triggered. The market continued to step up. Also, factories did not dump, and many short sellers also stopped. All the few customer shorts and longs returned, so there were fewer transactions. The market stepped up. However, there are currently sufficient raw materials. The big gangs have not moved. The official surge in the market will have to wait until the red market. The closing price yesterday was 75 for February and May, 1 and a half for March, 1 for April, not open for June, and 1.75 for July.</p>
<p>Futures and Spot Wheat Were Both Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures and spot were both quiet. Because there was a shortage of spot goods on the market and empty chips, no one was interested. However, the short sellers did not sell out, and short covering was healthy. As soon as a small amount was sold, the price rose. This month rose to 4 yuan and 1 jiao and a half, which was a large jiao higher than the closing price at the end of last month. March and April also rose by 1-2 fen.</p>
<p>Spot Wheat Arrived and Sold</p>
<p>Yesterday, 400 bags of wheat were sold, priced at 4 yuan and 1 jiao, for Fuxin.</p>
<p>One ship of wheat newly arrived. There were two more ships expected to arrive within the day. One of the newly arrived ships was already sold. The asking price for the latter two ships, including shipping, was 4 yuan and 2 jiao, but the factory was warned that there was no interest.</p>
<p>River Below Rice Prices Were All Firm</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 40 boats arrived from various routes, estimated to have more than 6,000 shi of goods. The market was firm due to rain and snow. Customer gangs chartered the boats. Southern gangs, such as Xiamen and Shantou, chartered nearly 3,000 bags of late rice from Songjiang, Sijing, and West Lian. Trading opened, and the market continued to rise by 5 fen. For each gang's thick japonica and Du Yangxian, the shops were quite healthy, and the market improved by several fen. Yin Yuan rice's price rose by 1 jiao because the sales of cake filling turned broad. However, the Bian Yuan market was neither glorious nor disgraceful.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 50 boats arrived from various places below the river. Each goods on the market sold very healthy. Chartering boats had no action. If you open each goods such as White Japonica, Yangxian, Pu Xian, and White Yuan etc., the price rises with a corner. Du Xian, Ke Xian, and early rice and thin rice etc. see the price rise with a few cents. Yin Yuan was flat. Fuzhou gangs stopped selling Ke Xian.</p>
<p>Quanzhou's Business Interest Is Still Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian arrived and sold equally, and the market turned steady. Even Min Province is going very well, and the market price is rising. The inventory has been cleared, and the market has a tendency to rise step by step. However, the high price attracts distant customers, and the sources of Xiang and Gan are very strong. Many have arrived in Shanghai these days. Quanzhou is newly open for business, and the market price does not fall due to the arrival of too much. But yesterday, Fuzhou gangs stopped selling because they have chartered a lot of boats these days, which is enough for the end of the year and the need for the red market. There are not many days left in the year, so they stopped selling and closed. Therefore, the trading was already light the day before, and yesterday only 126 bags of rough oil rice were traded, and no one asked about the machine-made rice. Quanzhou gangs have stopped selling for a long time and are starting again. There were few goods going, so yesterday's business interest was still strong, with 312 bags of red rough rice at 5 yuan and 8 jiao, 182 bags of Wuxi machine rice at 6 yuan and 7 jiao, 700 bags of Beijing Xian rice at 6 yuan and 6 jiao, and 300 bags of our factory's Xian rice at 6 yuan and 7 jiao. Lower grade rice was reduced accordingly. The market price was similar to the previous session.</p>
<p>Yellow Bean's Sales Status Was Quite Active</p>
<p>Yesterday's yellow bean market situation, the overall trend had no major changes. The source was connected but not enthusiastic, and the sales of various parties were quite active, so the market price continued to maintain a firm and steady situation. Yesterday's consolidated market transaction was one vehicle of Zhengyangguan beans, three vehicles of Yingzhou beans, more than 100 bags of Jiangbei beans, 50 bags of Tanzhou large grain beans, three vehicles of Guide beans, more than 200 bags of Dangshan beans, one vehicle of Mengcheng beans, one vehicle of Haozhou beans, and two vehicles of Bengbu beans. One of the vehicles had moldy grains, so it was 2 jiao different from the relatively good beans, it was said.</p>
<p>The Sugar Market Roughly Sand White Suddenly Rose by 3 jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rose sharply to 1.950 due to the sudden rise in Customs Gold, and the trend was very tight. The association drew a price of 19 yuan and 8 jiao for ordinary rough sand white, a rise of 3 jiao compared to the previous day. Transit goods were called at 6 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, but it was not made, a rise of 2 jiao compared to the previous day. Dutch red remained unchanged due to the cold weather and clumping, and there was little in and out. Taikoo Sugar B Mark rose by 2 jiao, to 20 yuan and 2 jiao. Our factory's cotton white rose sharply to 19 yuan and 9 jiao due to the sudden rise in rough sand white, a rise of 2 jiao. Chao Qing only opened more than 300 bags of lower-grade goods, priced at 11 yuan and 3 jiao to 2 jiao.</p>
<p>North-South Goods White Lotus Rose Step by Step with Land Price</p>
<p>Lanxi White Lotus: The smallest price used to be within 30 yuan due to sluggish sales. Recently, land prices suddenly saw a step-by-step tightening, and Shanghai's market rose accordingly. Yesterday, the market price of goods with higher prices needed 33-34 yuan, and the next one was 31-32 yuan, a rise of 2-3 yuan compared to the previous price.</p>
<p>Overseas Silk Sales Are Gradually Launched for Silk and Tea</p>
<p>New York Silk Prices Have All Been Rising Step by Step</p>
<p>Our port's American silk merchant firm received a telegram from New York yesterday, saying that most silk weaving factories have resumed work, the use of raw silk has gradually increased, and silk prices have all been rising step by step. The standard Japanese silk price converted to Chinese currency has broken through the 500 yuan mark. The price of grade B white factory silk with a uniformity of 81 fen and a count of 20-22 strips has also opened at 560-70 yuan.</p>
<p>The Source of Sichuan and Hubei Yellow Silk Has Been Stopped</p>
<p>Our port's Sichuan and Hubei yellow silk shops have all received express mail from silk shops in the place of origin, saying that the Yangtze River water is shallow, and river ships cannot directly transport. The shipment of Sichuan and Hubei yellow silk has been temporarily postponed, and normal shipment can only be made after the river transport is restored.</p>
<p>Sales of Yellow and White Factory Silk Have Gradually Moved</p>
<p>Each European and American estate in our port, in view of the rising prices of silk in New York and Lyon and the gradual rise in factory sales, has sent telegrams to Chinese silk merchants to discuss the matter. Telegrams for current yellow and white factory silk have been sent out a lot. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and others entered 50 packages of yellow and white factory silk, and the price was still firm.</p>
<p>The Sales of Piece Goods Overcoat Woolen Cloth Have Come to an End</p>
<p>The sales of woolen cloth overcoats are now coming to an end. Because of the relationship between transportation and time, no one needs to charter it even if it is cheap. The streets are also unwilling to import more because the days for actual sales are gradually shortening. If there are orders, they will rather pay a high price to buy and cut them piecemeal. Therefore, those who have existing stocks of woolen overcoats are willing to sell them cheaply. Yesterday, a good Chinese colorful woolen overcoat was wholesaled for 5 yuan, but few people accepted it. There was still some retail business. Clothing shops priced each such overcoat at 30 foreign yuan, which was 3-4 yuan lower than last month. It is said that ordinary colorful woolen overcoats are now sold for more than 20 foreign yuan per piece.</p>

<p>Relocation of a Renowned Trauma Clinic: He Boyun, a famous trauma doctor and former medical consultant to the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Bureau Police Sports Association, is highly regarded for his expertise in treating injuries from falls, blows, knife wounds, and artillery fire, as well as for his skill in reconnecting fractured tendons and bones. His clinic, formerly located next to Hong An on Bazilu (Targets Road), has seen such a surge in patients that the original space became insufficient. He has now relocated to No. 44, Dekang Lane, Gesheng Road, Zhabei, where he will continue to provide consultations as usual. Furthermore, he is making his family's secret recipe for "Die Da Huan Hun Wan" (Trauma Revival Pills) available to the public at a particularly low price, aiming for widespread accessibility.

This sacrifice truly marks a new era in on-site gift promotions. Originally scheduled for five days, the promotion had already expired, but due to repeated letters from all sectors requesting an extension to promote wider accessibility, the owner reluctantly agreed to extend it until the end of the roof construction period.</p>
<p>Scientific Nourishment: The Sino-Western Pharmacy on Simalu (Fourth Road) has been launching new and innovative products year after year. Recently, they purchased the latest German cold-press machine and equipment and hired a US-trained medical doctor to invent a type of ampoule containing a 40-degree concentrated juice of vitamin chicken essence and vitamin beef essence juice, preserving the original nutritional components. From sterilization to tube filling, the entire process is completely mechanized and does not involve manual labor. The Bess-Tou intermittent three-stage sterilization method is used, resulting in a highly effective tonic. Each box contains twelve ampoules and is priced at $1.75. Currently, during the pharmacy's special discount period, the price is particularly low and includes free gifts.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, The accurate details of the Kailuan Coal Mine strike have been communicated in our previous letters, which we hope you have taken note of. We have now received a telegram from the Tianjin General Office on the 31st of last month, stating that the miners' strike was resolved on the 31st and that all mines have resumed work. Starting from the 1st of this month, all aspects of mining and transportation have returned to normal, etc. The Hakka people in various provinces along the Yangtze River, who usually use our coal, are quite concerned about this miners' strike. In order to clarify the truth for the Hakka people, we respectfully request that your newspaper disclose this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section. We would be very grateful. Respectfully, Kailuan Sales Office, Shanghai, February 2nd.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Reading and Low-Level Tastes (1) <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>|| Reply to Mr. He Chang (Continued)</p>
<p>We are very pleased that you are concerned about our "Reading Q&amp;A." Although "Reading Q&amp;A" has only been around for a month, the letters we have received from various places have all unanimously encouraged us, leaving us with no choice but to work harder. As for the standards you mentioned, they were originally what we had planned. The current discussions are all about general issues, which some readers may find too profound and empty, while others may find them too superficial and bordering on platitudes. These opinions all have some basis. When the other work of this section has not yet been done perfectly (for example, the Self-Study Series cannot be published immediately), those friends who are eager to get some concrete guidance will naturally feel unsatisfied, and for the general discussion, they will inevitably consider it profound. On the other hand, friends who already have considerable academic ability, after reading our discussions, scattered and unsystematic, which do not contain any profound or mysterious comments, will naturally consider them "platitudes" that are not worth considering. However, we also have our reasons. First, our original standard was to improve interest, which was set up for readers with general academic abilities that are not abundant. It is "not a garden specifically for intellectuals to explore academically," and we are extremely willing to make it ordinary, popular, and without any "mysterious and profound" elements. Second, we cannot cater to low-level tastes and must fight against them. In the future, we should gradually move from general discussions to smaller and more specific first questions, but the explanations should still strive for popularity, so that everyone who has not attended school can understand them. We believe that only when readers raise more concrete and practical questions will our guides be able to lead us to more practical solutions. We will definitely not disregard reality and artificially raise the standard of "guidance," unless it meets the general practical requirements of the readers.</p>
<p>Now, let's go further and briefly talk about how to overcome low-level tastes.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the majority of Shanghai citizens are still mired in low-level tastes. This expression can be seen not only in reading materials but also in entertainment and various life activities. This is true in everything. Generally speaking, this is a reflection of a kind of social and economic foundation, which is not surprising. We don’t need to have feelings of disgust or contempt for it, but we must fight against it to improve it because it also has a counter-effect on political and economic development. We cannot allow it to continue to spread. Now we are only talking about "low-level taste" reading materials, which are also the crystallization of feudal ideas, and it has the effect of binding the mind "upward" and "free." We cannot allow it to continue to exist and make everyone's life go backward.</p>
<p>Overcoming this taste is naturally not a simple matter and cannot be removed by an order. It is not just by your "enlightenment" that you will gain his conviction. The fundamental destructive power lies in the improvement of the general living environment of society, the improvement of education and cultural standards, and the gradual acquisition of a dominant position by new consciousness. Without being infatuated with the foundation of old bones, naturally, this kind of taste in reading materials cannot be produced. The Mandarin Ducks and Butterfly school still has a resurgence of power in China today, which is not without reason!</p>
<p>However, it is naturally our collective duty and practical need to accelerate their decline. However, the scope involved in this project includes criticism; the introduction of new works and the correction of all concepts, but as a whole, this section can naturally only do a small part of it. Moreover, what can be done now is to prevent everyone from eating morphine as a meal and replace it with a hygienic and nourishing food.</p>
<p>As for how to promote the gospel of "hygiene"? This is indeed a difficult task. For example, if his hobby is to read "Yu Li Hun" (Jade Pear Spirit), you must not immediately ask him to read Coal King, because these two "hobbies" are too far apart. Don't be afraid of trouble. You should introduce him to a book that is slightly more advanced than "Yu Li Hun" and the natures are not too far apart, such as "A Bundle of Love Letters" and give it to him to read. When he feels that the novels written in vernacular Chinese are interesting enough, you can take another step and send him a copy of Miyan (Lost Lamb) and gradually give him more high-level reading materials. When he has some awareness, you can introduce him to some more advanced or even very hard things, and he will no longer avoid it. This is how to lead the way.</p>
<p>In addition to this, of course, we should expand the ruthless criticism of low-level things ｜old｜, and expose its weaknesses in a popular and detailed way. On the active side, not only should there be new alternatives, but they should also be made "high" but not "deep." Regarding this point, we have a strong desire to compile some profound and famous things in a popular way, but this also depends on the efforts of everyone in society, not relying on a few individuals to succeed.</p>
<p>This section has decided to adopt the above methods for the "Reading Guidance" work. For the same two letters asking "How to start with literature," our answers may be completely different. If a person has some foundation, we will directly introduce him to some high-level hobbies. If someone likes "antiques" very much, then we will not rush to make him do an impossible long jump, but only introduce some appetite-stimulating agents to change his taste. Therefore, this kind of work is more troublesome than school education, but it is very practical. Therefore, this part of the work can only be answered and cannot be published in the "Reading Q&amp;A" column. In terms of form, there may be some contradictions in our draft replies, but this is a certain order in the unified education process.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that Mr. He and the enthusiastic teachers will give serious criticism to the above remarks.</p>
<p>Chunqiu</p>
<h3 id="e224">Solution <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>A solution, regardless of the time, place, matter, or environment, is an indispensable treasure.</p>
<p>If you unintentionally win the lottery but did not pre-plan a life outline after winning before the draw, you will naturally frown and roll your eyes, trying to figure out a way to handle this huge amount of money. Otherwise, you will be at a loss.</p>
<p>Looking out the window, you happen to see the bedroom of a modern woman. If you want to have a secret tryst with this modern woman, you must come up with a solution. If this modern woman is interested in you, but you are a stubborn man and insist on remaining indifferent, then you need to think of a way to avoid trouble.</p>
<p>A big guy is fighting with a little kid. The big guy's head is cracked open, and the little kid's arm is broken. The patrolman dozing under the eaves strides over, hails two rickshaws, and sends them to the hospital. This is also one of the solutions.</p>
<p>If a husband gambles, drinks, and engages in prostitution, neglecting the family and ignoring household expenses, or if one encounters a fierce, unreasonable wife, the opposing party will always have to think carefully and come up with a solution.</p>
<p>"When water comes, use earth to block it; when soldiers come, use generals to resist" is an example. At the same time, the empty city ploy, offering a map, and the surrender of the naked king are undeniable solutions. Burning books and burying scholars is, of course, an excellent way to prevent rebellion.</p>
<p>Therefore, we don't need to curse civil war because civil war is a way for some people to find a way out. We don't need to curse "don't become an official if there's no one in court" because this is a way for those in court to help their poor relatives and friends.</p>
<p>After a mess, we always see the adults stroking their beards and saying, "We must come up with a way to deal with the aftermath." Although whether this method can be implemented and whether it can be effectively handled are unknown, "we must think of a way" is always a self-evident truth.</p>
<p>When there's no solution, commit suicide. In fact, "suicide" is a solution. Therefore, I believe that only those who live under the slogan of "no solution" are the most helpless people in the world and should suffer.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Year-End in the Countryside <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>"On a plate from the distant market, no delicacies are found,</p>
<p>In a jar from the poor home, only old wine is drawn;</p>
<p>I can talk with the old neighbor face to face,</p>
<p>Across the fence, I call him to drink the remaining cup."</p>
<p>This poem by Du Gongbu (Du Fu) describes the joyful interactions between friends and neighbors in the countryside, which seems more genuine than opening champagne and eating fancy meals in the city. In winter, the countryside is filled with piles of rice, wheat, taro, and yams; many vegetables are planted in the fields; many chickens, ducks, pigs, and sheep are raised in the pens; the old wife weaves many bolts of homespun cloth; the daughter cooks fragrant rice; and the son brews strong wine. There's no need to buy coal with money, and there's no need to install water heaters, prepare electric furnaces, or burn animal charcoal and firewood to keep warm and cook meals. None of the essential elements of life—clothing, food, and shelter—require relying on others; they are readily available. Can city dwellers enjoy this kind of simple pleasure?</p>
<p>Although living in humble thatched huts, they still breathe fresh air, bask in warm sunlight, look at distant mountains, and listen to flowing water. The smoke, clouds, flying birds, green trees, and blue clouds are there for them to enjoy every day. In the city, what allows you to enjoy this? Rushing around anxiously, faces covered in dust, what's the point? What's the point?</p>
<p>The grim shadows of the city envelop people, and cunning, deceit, ferocity, madness... and sickness are all revealed. As the cold weather arrives and the year draws to a close, the city reveals an increasingly distressed face. In the countryside, with fragrant wine and rice, basking in the sun and chatting idly, talking only about mulberry and hemp and not asking about governance and disorder, they are truly the "favored ones of heaven." Although it is said that the countryside is bankrupt, after all, places without bandits are better than the city.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Night's Weariness <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Defang</p>
<p>Some people say that night is ugly because people hide under the curtain of darkness and do all kinds of irrational things; once it's night, the kind becomes evil, and the pure becomes filthy. But is this because of the night's mysterious seduction that makes it so? Or do the people wearing false masks reveal their true colors? Some people also say that night is beautiful, that night is so quiet, the moonlight is so gentle, the stars blinking with their delicate eyes are so lovely, the towering height of the pagoda, the tinkling of flowing water by the stream, the swaying of flower branches and tree shadows, and the dong-dong of cold rain knocking on the window, what the Lord shows in the night is a hundred times more full of poetry, allowing people to chant or sing praises; night has infinitely beautiful posture, at least in the eyes of an enthusiast.</p>
<p>Like me, I can't curse it because of the ugliness of the night, and I won't praise it just because it has such beauty. Night only gives me a kind of goodwill, and this goodwill makes me remember it when I am working because it allows me to enthusiastically hook me into its arms after a day's work of weariness. I rest, unusually sweet, quiet, all evil thoughts, all illusory pursuits, go far away, go far away, I sometimes even hear laughter in my dreams, night makes me dependent, although we still have to part at that time.</p>
<p>The sky is becoming more and more hazy, and the space is like countless layers of green-gray smoke floating. The teacher bird shot past like an arrow, and in the blur, it seemed to disappear into the clouds. Ah Hua can only open half an eye to look at you, although she is still leaning at your feet; under the sweet sleep of the little sister, picture postcards, harmonicas, and song collections are also scattered and snuggling together; the chicks can't find their mother and close their eyes, constantly chirping and looking up... This is a picture of "Night Weariness," and night also covers the world with a thin veil at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Bamboo Wife and Tang Pozi (Hot Water Bottle) <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>In the scorching summer that makes people dizzy, after a day of hard work, you want to rest at night, but the heat is so oppressive that even if you don't wear a thread and wave a large palm fan, you will still sweat and find it difficult to fall asleep. At this time, if you have a bamboo wife to hug you to sleep, you will feel cool all over and comfortable throughout your body. Naturally, your soul will leave your body and you will no longer suffer from the heat. Because the bamboo wife is not only naturally beautiful but also has icy skin and snowy flesh. Just imagine having such a beautiful bamboo wife to hug you to sleep, a great blessing, what else do you want? If you still complain about the heat, then only "Heaven knows"! Therefore, the bamboo wife is a beloved object in the summer, especially for burly guys, who cannot do without her. But when the golden wind brings coolness and the oppressive heat disappears completely, sleeping at night already feels as cool as water. Then, the bamboo wife at this time, is just like youth that has passed, no longer suitable, and will be abandoned like an autumn fan!</p>
<p>As for the Tang Pozi (hot water bottle), as soon as we hear her name, we know that she is a wizened old woman with wrinkled skin and white hair, fat and short, and of a fiery temperament. Where does she have the naturally beautiful icy skin and snowy flesh like the bamboo wife? She also does not have the gentle and considerate elegant attitude of the bamboo wife! It is always thought that no one likes her. However, that's not the case. Who knows that in this cold and freezing winter season, it is precisely the time when the Tang Pozi is triumphant. If you don't believe me, look at the general people in this cold night, who doesn't want to pull the Tang Pozi into the quilt to share a warm dream? No matter how ugly the Tang Pozi is, everyone only knows to passionately love her, and will not get tired of her. Do you think it's strange?</p>
<p>Although, I feel from this that the ups and downs of life are also like this. For example, when people get you, they can't wait to hold you up to the thirty-third heaven. When they don't need you, they can't wait to throw you down to the eighteenth level of hell, and even kicking you would be good. Alas! Looking at it this way, the warmth and coldness of human relationships are originally uncertain. Then, what's so strange about the bamboo wife and the Tang Pozi being liked and disliked at times?</p>
<h3 id="e228">Northeast Fourth Company Commander <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p>
<p>Unable to bear the pain, he listened intently to the music.</p>
<p>The happy time was not enough; he hastened to leave upon the arrival of a telegram.</p>
<p>After hearing these words from Jiang, she stood there dumbfounded, looking at him and saying, "Could it be that the situation outside the pass isn't very good?" Zi Qiang smiled and said, "It's not that bad, not that it's that bad." As he was saying this, Gui Zhi, who was sitting in the new room, heard it. Holding the door curtain, leaning diagonally against the door frame, she looked at Zhao Ziqiang and asked, "Just now, a guest came from the city to deliver a telegram to you, right?" Zhao Ziqiang nodded and replied yes. Gui Zhi looked at her mother, then looked at her husband, deliberately calming herself down, and asked in a very gentle voice, "Can I see your telegram?" How could Zhao Ziqiang disobey his new wife? He had to slowly pull the telegram out of his pocket and hand it to Gui Zhi with both hands. When she received it and looked at it, it read:</p>
<p>To Zhao Ziqiang, Company Commander, Hengfeng Rice Store, Xizhimen Avenue, Beiping, as per the instructions of the regimental commander, you are ordered to return to the defense immediately. Do not delay. Must not delay. Battalion Commander Bao Fang.</p>
<p>By chance, Gui Zhi completely recognized the words on the telegram. Holding the telegram paper with both hands, she trembled uncertainly, and the words in her heart were self-evident.</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p>
<p>Pouring wine and serving meals, wild celebration with farewell tears</p>
<p>Lighting a lamp to warm dreams, chanting softly through the long night</p>
<p>Everyone knew that Zhao Ziqiang's return home to get married this time was a short stay, but he was leaving in less than a week. This was something that Zhao Ziqiang himself had not expected. Zhao Weng heard about the telegram from inside the house, stuck his head out to look, and then saw the three people standing in the hall, in that state, and he understood in his heart. So, he corrected his expression and said to Ziqiang, "The body of a soldier belongs to the country. It is already very rare for you to be able to ask for leave to come back and get married. Since Battalion Commander Bao has sent a telegram, you should quickly return to the camp." If the situation is a little peaceful, I also want to go to see the outside of the pass. I will take Gui Zhi and Old Mrs. Yang to Xifengkou." (237)</p>
