<h3 id="c1">遠東問題海軍問題不可分離　日慮英美恊力處置　華盛頓方面重視政治討論　英請書内容充滿妥恊語氣　日擬向英美兩國分頭談判 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>（華盛頓）今日國際觀察者預測、英美將恊力抵制日本對明年海軍軍縮會議初步談判提出之議程、據稱、日本現正竭力與英美兩國分别談話、期於遠東政治問題及海軍問題獲得初步諒解、惟今日可靠方面宣稱、英美外交家僉認政治問題與海軍比率問題、實有不可分離之連帶關係、日本在亞洲大陸之軍事行動益使彼等難於單獨對口談判、英美以爲兩國在遠東之商業地位、及太平洋全部市塲、均於此政治談判中、存亡所繫、今日國務院表示、美國已通知英國、願意加入海軍會議之初步談判、此項初步談判在倫敦舉行、惟日期尙未决定、細則亦未確定、所可知者、此項會議將完全爲非正式性質云、英國亦巳邀請日·意·法參加、此項會議不僅爲兩國代表分頭接談、三四國代表且將同時會議云、次談判首將確定明年會議之手續、决定日期與地點後、再討論海軍實質問題等其他事件、今日華盛頓日人方面宣稱、倫敦方面旣已發起此事、彼等實無再向國務院討論海軍問題之理由云、若干外交家信東京與華盛頓方面不久將派遣海軍專家赴倫敦、俾於預備會議中襄助兩國大使、（二十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）據今日官方人員表示、廣田外相將於星期杪訓令駐英大使松平、向英政府表示、日政府凖備討論一九三五年海軍會議事件、預料倫敦之討論、除會議之日期·地點·及進行手續諸問題外、似尙將涉及海軍限制一類之重要問題、向日政府探詢意見者、雖僅爲英國、而據現象觀之、日方亦願應請在華盛頓作同樣談話、舉行海軍會議以前作初步談話之議、固爲一般人士所歡迎、而本地報紙則切言宜注視英美間之談話、俾免英美先有成議、然後威脅日本接受、如一九三○年之所爲、此種論調、似爲官方觀念之反映、日報雖謂日本僅願獲原則上之均等、而藉以維持主權與國防、但盛倡取銷比率、謂此項比率、有種種不便、被迫建造不急需諸類之軍艦、亦其一也、云云、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於明年舉行會議之討論、各方面皆力守緘默、外交部與海軍部皆不願表示意見、衆信討論程度今尙不過初步探詢耳、一九三○年海軍會議開始以前、曾有初步談話、頗有助於會議之成功、故今亦擬預作談話、其所將討論之事件、殆爲一九三五年會議之日期·與地點·及應請與會之國家、聞法意兩國對於英國所發參加談話之請尙未答覆、但衆料此兩國定願參加、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<h3 id="c2">日本恊議對英請書覆文　外務省海軍省　開始愼重討論 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>（東京）今日探悉、日政府接英外相西門之請、對於海軍問題預先交換意見、以謀海軍會議之便利、聞日政府擬與英美兩國分别談話、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）英西門外相提議召開軍縮預備會議、日本政府對此表示同意、然西門外相之提議、對於開會日期及議題等桫有表示、故將於此點明白後、由外務海軍兩當局恊議、發出正式回答、但日本因廣由外相曾於議會有聲明、擬與各國分别進行預備會談、商議具體事項、（二十六日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）據外務省二十五日接到駐英松平大使電報、英西門外相於十七日會見松平大使、主張舉行召開海軍軍縮預備會議、以期達成世界和平、銷弭戰爭威脅及輕减國民負擔之三大根本目的、西門外相又略述英國海軍之軍制及英國對於海軍一般問題之見解、而請求日政府之回知、松平大使因此問題非常重大、未發負責談話、保留回答、（二十六日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務省對於西門所提之三國預備會議案、已於二十六日以駐日英使所談爲中心、由廣田外相邀集重光外次等人開始愼重討論、並擬參酌海軍當局之意向、以便决定態度、將由廣田外相報告於閣議後、卽向英國發出正式回答、聞此項會議並非聚日英美三國於一堂之會談、當由日美日英英美各國分别交涉、形式上大致如此、但視其狀况若何、或三國會商於一室、亦未可知、此項會議多半在七月至九月間當可實現云（二十六日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）在明年軍縮會議之前、日本海軍業已及早凖備、近以英外相西門對駐英日大使通知舉行預備會議、是以海軍亦擬於最近當由外務省轉其回答預備參加之意、一面關於軍縮正式會議之召集、亦經着手凖備一切矣云（廿六日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）駐日英國代理大使多德氏於廿六日午後一時頃訪晤重光外次、提議召開海軍預備會議案、其内容與西門外相向駐英日使提出者相同、並探詢日本政府之方針、重光外次略謂、此事甚好、但事勢至爲重大、當舉關係方面充分商妥之後、方能給予答覆云、（廿六日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）海軍軍縮會議之預備倘經召集、則英國當以西門外相爲代表、美國必以其駐英大使賓甘氏及派駐日内瓦一般軍縮會議之全權代表台維斯氏充任、日本則以駐英大使松平氏爲首度代表、而以大使館參事官加藤外松氏爲其首席事務官、倘該項預備會議進展甚速、則日本駐英大使館之辦事人員當感不足、屆時可由外務省增派駐外書官以圖充實其陣容、廣田外相現已着手於該項人選、至於陸海軍方面更應以專門人才爲其顧問、使之參加、自不待言、大致將以駐在倫敦之海軍武官岡噺　大佐與陸軍中佐丸山政男氏充之、此外如駐日内瓦一般軍縮會議之日本代表陸軍少將森田宣氏及海軍大佐藤田利三郎氏均須遣往倫敦、日本方面之陣容在此業已整備就緒、近當由廣田外相發出訓令云、（二十六日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）次期軍縮會議、因倫敦條約第二十三條有規定、必定舉行、然開會地點形式及議題等並無規定、故必先由各國進行恊議、然究竟何國願任主辦國、列國均取愼重態度、探查他國意見、在此時際、英國俄然提議召開會議、蓋英國爲倫敦會議之召開國、其對於軍縮問題熱心實可敬服、於是一九三五年海軍會議之具體交涉、開始第一步驟、今後最堪注目者爲日英美三國之交涉如何也、（二十六日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）據倫敦方面消息、傳一九三五年海軍會議之預備交涉、將在東京倫敦兩地分别舉行、日本於此交涉、已讓步海軍率之平等要求、日本海軍對此、頃發表聲明、謂日本海軍仍然要求確立軍備權之平等、日本態度在使世界各國達成軍縮對於各自國防有均等之安全感、此志迄無何等變更之事實云、（二十六日電通社電）</p>
<h3 id="c3">英國請書内容　討論海軍實質問題　以英美日爲出發點 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>（東京）關於下屆海軍會議之凖備工作、將與重要海軍國間召集預備會議之提案、曾於十七日英外相與駐英日使會見之際、已由西門外相正式通知、事屬確實、外務省曾將西門提議之内容嚴守秘密、現得悉其要點如左、</p>
<p>㈠預備會議希望討論海軍實質上各種問題、</p>
<p>㈡預備會議專以海軍問題爲限、</p>
<p>㈢預備會議當由倫敦之外交機關發起、而與各國個别交涉、以便行使、</p>
<p>㈣預備會議至少以三國爲起點、而最初當以日英美三國開議、法意兩國目下尙無加入必要、</p>
<p>據上項内容觀之、則預備交涉並非討論下屆海軍會議之開會時期及會議之地點等之議題、乃係直接討論海軍軍縮問題之實質、蓋此項預備會議已增加其重大性矣、在英國方面則限制專就海軍問題之計論、外間有謂所傳之太平洋問題與遠東問題似無包含在内之意思、至於是否會合三國於一堂、而開始討論、雖屬疑問、但關於此點、日本政府亦曾希望與各國行使個别交涉、並以日英美三國之預備交涉爲重心、對於使人注目之該項提議、外務省當與海軍省愼重討論之後、方可給與答覆、唯上述各點旣屬提議之内容、又非違背日本政府之方針、是當欣然參加、故海軍會議可不待來年、而於事實上將在最近開幕云、（二十六日日聯電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）衆議員布立敦今日告美聯社訪員、如允日本提高海軍比率則間島、夏威夷及斐律濱將爲蠻横之日本軍閥所宰割無疑、布立敦議員爲衆院海軍委員會重要人物、久以熟番國際海軍問題見稱於時、其言曰、如日本堅持廢棄現有之海軍比率、則美國應卽於太平洋羣島修築防衛性之海軍空軍根據地、海軍條約將於明年重付討論之時、日本實無理由企圖擴大比率、日本侵占滿洲土地數千萬方里、亦不足使其有此必要、中國海軍更顯然不足爲患也、故惟一結論卽日本謀以獨覇世界之海軍、控制太平洋耳、若然、則太平洋其他國家、必須嚴防日本、不使其得再乘侵佔滿洲之故伎也、如日本堅持其現在之海軍政策、則間島甚易成爲日本强暴之軍國主義之俎上肉、是以吾人必須於該島設立佈防、吾人應於菲律濱要害地點擴充空軍根據地、夏威夷之防務亦應加强、俾成爲直布羅陀第二、吾人更宜要求將日本之他島移交美國或其他國家管理云、布立敦對於訂立新海軍條約之可能性稱、日本過去五年中對各國之條約無異廢紙、日本屠殺華人毁滅華人之財產、實爲無端侵略之惡例云、（二十五日國民電）</p>

<h3 id="c5">廢除苛雜不宜再緩敬 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>今日方苛捐雜稅之弊害者多矣。其言曰。自世界經濟恐慌潮流侵入後。我國經濟情勢遂愈見困窘。卽比較發達之紗業。且未能與外國輸入品競爭於市塲其他工業更不待言。蓋不僅向海外輸出。到處遭遇阻碍。卽欲在國内市塲勉强圖存。亦爲苛捐雜稅所阻。此廢除苛雜之不可延緩者。一也。</p>
<p>我國以農立國。而近來因穀價低賤。農民出其全部收穫。尙不足以圖温飽。乃相率脫離鄉村。致形成土地荒廢之恐慌。此種險象。雖可以天災及其他政治原因爲部分之解釋。而構成朝野隔閡及農村衰落之要素。當以苛捐雜稅爲第一。此類苛雜。設不根本掃除。匪特農村經濟之復興無望。卽欲暫維小康之局。亦所難能。此廢除苛雜之不可延緩者。二也。</p>
<p>卽以政府收支關係而論。中央政府之主要財源。厥爲關稅與鹽稅二者。初與苛雜無關。而統稅及印花收入。且不免因苛雜繁重而感受間接之影響。至於地方政府。或以爲倚賴苛雜。可以彌補正稅之不足。其實一般所謂苛雜。由稅吏私人中飽者多。由地方政府實收者。反居少數。是則法外徵收。徒招人民之怨恨。而無甚補助於政府。此廢除苛雜之不可延緩者。三也。</p>
<p>苛捐雜稅之弊害如此。深幸本屆財政會議解釋苛雜之性質。已决定六項範圍。並擬自本年七月一日起至十二月底止。分期裁撤然吾人又有不能已於言者。該會同時又决定。廢除苛雜後之抵補辦法。可以另案核議。而各省市之有特殊情形未能遵限廢除凈盡者。亦得專案呈部。吾人鑒於我國歷來會議之通病。在於議决而不能實施。終至形成懸案而後已。上述財政會議之决議案。附有兩種但書。一與抵補方法有關。一與各省市之特殊情形有關。竊恐流弊所及。將不免蹈旣往種種議案之覆轍。蓋廢除苛雜之舉。各省市旣可藉口抵補籌措未充而展緩實行。又可假借地方特殊情况而推諉卸責。結果。或使今年年底之限期。無形延長。須知我國土地廣大。交通阻滯任何地方。任何省市。皆有其特殊情形。如四川·雲南·新疆·西康·靑海等邊遠省分。其特殊之點。更舉不勝舉。而苛捐雜稅之繁重亦爲當世所罕見。政府如不厲行確實整頓之方針。則陽奉陰違者。必不少也。吾民無瞧類矣。</p>
<p>目前各省市財政狀况。洵有羅掘俱窮難乎爲繼之勢。然此種現象。實爲國民經濟瀕於破產之反映。設再不從事於根本培養使人民有喘息餘地及更生機緣。竊恐國民經濟一旦總崩潰。地方收入。亦不免同歸於盡也。孔財云。「人民負担已深縱再欲徵收苛捐。已不堪負荷。國家根本在民。何忍作無饜之增加。」可見民間疾苦。當局知之甚稔。無論地方有何特殊情形。要不能不排除萬難以解民倒懸也。</p>
<p>吾人以爲旣欲廢除苛雜當爲積極廓淸弊源而努力。不當爲消極抵補缺額而顧慮。往者苛雜之所以難廢大半因各地冗兵太多。府之給養無着。軍隊之紀律鬆弛。遂致轉而擾民故根本解决辦法。第一應由中央嚴令各省區不准編練額外軍隊。現役軍人而兼任省主席者。更不得私自擴充隊伍。第二當再妥籌裁兵方案。旣裁者分别遣散。未裁者給與的餉庶幾中樞命令。可以貫澈而苛捐雜稅亦終有廢除之一日。若不此之圖。而徒言抵補。仍恐無裨於實際耳。</p>

<p>關於軍縮問題、巴爾都謂以前歷屆内閣所行之政策依然遵守、卽在安全條件之下從事軍縮、並求軍備之平等也、但德國正式軍隊以外之軍事團體、法國不能置諸不問、且德國重整軍備之行動、一日不停、則法國卽一日不能承認裁軍、本年四月十七日法國致英國之復文、曾聲明法國始終以爲軍縮會議、當以裁軍爲其最後之結果、至於與和平條約相反之重整軍備、則非軍縮會議所當承認、但無論如何、國聯會與軍縮會議、並未閉門、法國政府乃始終擁護和平、始終忠於國聯會者也、</p>
<p>關於明年薩爾區授票問題巴爾都謂、投票人之自由絶對必須尊重、此次在日内瓦討論時、對於任何辦法、凡足使薩爾居民於投票後受報復之危險者、均堅决拒絶之、關於薩爾問題、法國由條約上取得之權利毫未放棄、此深足自喜者、巴爾都謂渠在日内瓦曾對薩爾問題特種委員會主席阿樂亞西聲明、謂對於薩爾居民投票必須採取有效之保障辦法、德國方面空言保證投票之自由、卽使爲正式宣言亦嫌不足、當時阿樂亞西與特種委員會曾擬定一種方式、認爲可以接受、卽「國聯會爲保護薩爾居民所能採取之各種辦法、法德兩國均願加以承認」、乃德國政府對此方式不願接受、殊可婉惜、</p>
<p>巴爾都最後謂、法國人民無一樂於作戰者、法國人竭盡力量以避免戰爭、渠相信戰爭必可避免、法國人對於友邦及同盟國將始終如一、法國與意大利成立友好妥恊非不可能、其與英國之關係並未冷淡云、此時有人對法國之國際關係提出問題、巴爾都答稱、法國並不處於孤立地位、言至此、全塲議員幾於全體鼓掌、卽社會黨亦在贊成之列、衆院旋以外長指日須赴日内瓦、乃决定將關於外交問題之質問案、延至外長回國以後再行討論隨卽散會、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>爲了業務上的需要，我誠懇地請求你們給我些指導。</p>
<p>我現在的職務是等於一個圖書館的管理員，不過名稱上的不同罷了。所以我很想求得一些關於「統計」「分類」「目錄編製」等學識，不知道有没有這一類學術的書？什麽書局出版？請先生詳爲示覆。</p>
<p>又，我在業餘很想研究些印刷上技術，不知國内有專門研究印刷的雜誌，或書本？併請指示，不勝感盼！</p>
<p>丨徐祝三來信丨</p>
<p>關於業務上需要的知識是最實踐物知識。這一方面的要求，我想自然不止徐君一人，而這方面的社會指導又是一向被人忽視了的。本欄以前也很少討論這類問題，但這不是我們不注意到此，實在是關於這類極平常的問題，反而是極不容易答覆的，以前我們對於許多方面的人才均未找好，所以有一次一位漆匠問我們一些化學上的問題，我們找了許多人都不能答覆，因此，常常不能滿足讀者之望。這次徐君提出的圖書館的知識，到是問到我們自己家裏來了。</p>
<p>不過，我們在商榷這類業務上需要的實際問題的知識以前，必先要明瞭他的業務是處在什麽一種部門·業務上的需要究竟是指那一工作上發生的困難？具體的内容和範圍是什麽？假如没有一種界限，我們的解答就無從着手了。</p>
<p>像徐君提出的問題我們就似乎嫌其含混，籠統，抽象，雖然他說到「統計」「分類」「編目」等問題，但是没有指出這類問題中任何一面較狹義的範圍，于此，我們也只能從一般的圖書館學理上，就管見所及，寫些于下··</p>
<p>一，分類在圖書館中是一項最繁重的工作，這是大家所公認的。圖書分類的含義，就是一般所謂把「件質相同的放在一處」之義，可是，這話驟然看去，似乎意義很明顯，没有甚麽困難，實則常常有一本書有列入兩類或三類以上的事實，遇到這種紛歧和模稜兩可的境界時，常常要費很多的時間去苦思的，所以做這項工作有時候眞會得使人耐煩不了，因爲得不到最適當的一個别類：但有時候也會感覺樂從中來，興趣盎然，不過話雖這樣說，處理一件任何事情，總有它的原則和經騐可資凖繩的，我們姑舉三點如下（一）圖書分類旣没有絶對的科學類别，那我們一方可以理論爲依據，他方却以事實爲前提，在這兩者中間溶合貫通之就是了。我們唯一只要使圖書在運用上感覺取放的便利，那末犧牲一點學理上的定律，是可以的。舉一個例說，如自然科學中的電學和應用技術中的電學，前者是關於自然科學中原理上的電學；後者是關於應用技術中技術上的電學，我們依據理論來分類，上面所舉的兩個例子，應該給它兩個類别，但是假使藏書不多，同時爲某個問題的參考和避免散放起見，歸納在一個類别下，與事實也很合理，（二）對每一本書確定它的類别時儘量取這高的含意，舉個例說，如有一本關於「五卅事件」的書，這書給它分在中日和中英外交問題上也可，分在中國近代史上也可但决不像分在中國民族解放革命運動的含義偉大多了，（三）分類的排列先後順序，是有相當意義的，這點也須儘量依據學理上的定律，舉個例說，如有幾種關於社會思想史記載的圖書，必要顧到發生的次序，不能前後的倒置。</p>
<p>上面舉的三項，是屬於分類方法上一般的扼要論據，同時這一方面的學理，在這裏寫來是嫌紙短話長的，不能一一詳舉。至於分類採用那一種方法的問題，我們在大體上是同意杜威底十進法，以其有伸縮性，如果圖書館的規模小，備書不多，只須用大綱，如果規模大，圖書多，可綱目兼用，如果綱目猶嫌不够，可加用小數點。</p>
<p>（二）編目是圖書館繼分類工作後一種更完善的工作，圖書館有完備的目錄，讀者才可藉目錄的引導檢取心中所欲的資料，不過這編目是一個最實際的而且須靠實習始可領會的，况且編目全看這圖書館的需要和簡繁來確定工作的，有些圖書館僅製書名目錄一種有些圖書館還有著者目錄，標題目錄，分類目錄，甚至字典式目錄，但通常圖書館備置書名和著者二種目錄的居多，至編目的方法有許多規則事實上很難列舉，好在下面有專書介紹，這裏不再贅述。</p>
<p>（三）統計的的問題，我們也以爲與編目近乎同樣一種情形，就是徐君提出的在業務上發生出來的材料怎樣去統計，這全要根據實際的需要來决定的，至於統計的原理與方法，後列幾種書籍可供參考。</p>
<p>（四）關於專門研究印刷術的雜誌和書籍，國内實在没有聞見，最近商務印書館的出版週刊從七十五期起有一欄『印刷常識』一鱗半爪，也値得一閱。再今天報載該館出版一本近代印刷術，定價四角，我們特地去購閱，據說還是他們的處女作品，這點點東西或許稍稍塡滿你萬一的印刷知識慾望吧。</p>

<h3 id="c202">競爭槪况 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>▲甲二百公尺朱洪琪自前日在百公尤决賽中、造成十一秒五之優異紀錄之後、一般人咸料昨日之一百公尺、當必有可觀之成績發現、起步則後朱愛賢一步、百公尺外尙文之朱一邁、頗有奪魁之想、萬竹之朱始動聲色、結果朱洪琪終能先破底綫、但成績二十五秒八、</p>
<p>▲甲八百公尺有論及小學體育者、則均主張徑賽祇多以四百公尺爲長距離跑、蓋年齡幼稚、精氣神三者俱未充足、昨日之八百公尺與賽者、除冠軍尙文傅元祥、尙能應付外、餘子皆到達終點、但均有力竭聲嘶之神態、</p>
<p>▲百十低欄和安高連　爲是項之天材、倘能許其苦心造詣、則前程大有希望、觀夫過欄姿勢之優美、將達終點之衝刺、莫不儼然有老儒之身乎、尙文沈如新起步有程金冠之雄姿惜後勁尙弱、成績十五秒六、尙屬不惡、</p>
<p>▲急行跳遠朱洪琪又點首席、次名華志　亦驃悍可喜兩兩相較、初差者極微、此項紀錄爲五公尺七一、尙待時日、必能活躍於壇毡之上、</p>
<p>▲撑竿跳高撑杆跳高須洪根過竿時多爲滾式、姿勢尙須糾正、而第四名之廣公、小小黑炭何東純、成績雖不及前三名然其在第六七八次與其他爭奪、均在第三次、卒被獲四、殊不易也雖不佳妙、但絶不可以其小而忽之、當須</p>
<p>洪根最後搗竿而起之精神、良堪嘉佩也、</p>
<p>▲乙丙二百公尺萬竹蘇龍章以善於衝刺而獲冠軍、和安和根龍雖居第三、尙允其游刃有餘、而鄭良至與談紀鎬、均爲小將中之奇士、起步與終點之力反拚、有成人之神氣、</p>
<p>▲八百公尺接力尙文獨多二百公尺之角色、若朱愛賢若胡士華若沈如新輩胥皆虎視耽耽者、第一棒萬竹曾較佔優勢、二棒卽萎縮特甚、及至第四棒朱洪琪雖稱饒勇、亦難起死回生矣、</p>

<h3 id="c235">學生們怎樣實行新生活？ <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 伯眞</p>
<p>「新生活，新生活。」多麽時髦的一個口號。新生活的目的：是在建設國家和復興民族的基礎！提高國民智識和道德！在使一般國民的衣、食、住、行能整齊，淸潔，簡單，樸素。合乎禮、義、廉、恥！可見新生活的目的是多麽重大！多麽緊要！</p>
<p>我們學生是將來國家的主人翁，救國的責任都在我們的肩頭上。我們是實行新生活的先鋒隊，所以我們應該要明瞭怎樣實行新生活。</p>
<p>最重要的大槪有左列的二點：</p>
<p>（一）規矩：我們做人非守規矩不可，所以新生活的規條裏，也有規矩這一條。早晨見了人，應該說聲「早」。分别的時候，說聲「再會」。諺語說：「呌人不蝕本，舌上打個滾。」吃飯的時候，不可有魯莽的舉動。走路要靠左邊。規矩的條文很多，不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>（二）淸潔：淸潔是延年益壽的要訣，所以新生活的條文中也有淸潔這一條。衣服宜常洗，窗户要常開，指甲要常剪，頭髮要常梳。</p>
<p>我想一定有人要說：「這樣多的條文，要一條一條去實行，這是多麽困難，多麽麻煩呀。」事實上這有什麽艱難呢？怕麻煩做什麽人呢？祗要每天實行一二條，不到一二月，你便實行了新生活了。</p>
<p>小月友們，我想你們眞的一定不怕困難和麻煩的。</p>
<h3 id="c236">五月的故事 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 丁合</p>
<p>五月的一個晚上，英弟和蘭妹，正爲着一塊糕，槍得扭打的時候；　　爸爸從外回来；他們見了爸爸，就丢去了糕，上前呌爸爸。</p>
<p>爸爸對他們，却只笑笑，就在旁邊的一隻椅子上坐下。以後，就呌他們坐在一旁，也呌我坐在旁邊。</p>
<p>爸爸先開口問弟弟，現在是幾月。</p>
<p>英弟很快的說是「五月」。爸爸再問蘭妹，蘭妹也很快的說「五月」。爸爸又問我。</p>
<p>「五月是五月，不過，我們應當呌他國恥月才是。」</p>
<p>等我說完，爸爸點點頭說「很對」。但是英弟蘭妹，奇怪起來。在這時，爸爸就嘆息說：</p>
<p>「祗是記着，不想雪恥，已經不是我們應當做的事情，你們，不但不想雪恥，而且記都不記得」。</p>
<p>於是英弟蘭妹哭了，這時候，爸爸反笑起來，就把五月的一段故事，從頭到底，細細的告訴他們。</p>
<p>爸爸講完了五月的故事，英弟說：「我們要聯合中國的小朋友，一起起來雪恥，一起起來雪恥。」</p>
<h3 id="c237">手足之爭 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 胡藴五</p>
<p>某日，手與足互爭貴賤，手駡足道：「世界上没有比你「足」的輕賤。爲什麽呢，第一你的足掌，終日踏在地上，永不見天日，第二你的尊容「足」，倘若拿起來給人看，人都要駡你知敬了。」足笑道：「試問我污穢的時候，洗我足的，不是你「手」嗎？你要去拿東西，倘若我不肯移動，你能拿得到嗎？」手爲足所詰質，弄得閉口難言，足又說道：天下無論什麽事，没有貴賤可分的，各有各的用處，總要相互帮助，才能够發生效用。</p>
<h3 id="c238">動物的脚 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>小朋友！我們把各種大小動物來研究，是非常有興味的。單從它們的『脚』來講，已經形形色色，非常有趣啊。</p>
<p>陸地上的動物，都是有脚的。水中的動物，有的脚變爲鯺：有的脚上生了蹼：這是甚麽緣故呢？因爲在陸上走的動物，有脚方可步行；在水裏的動物，有鯺或蹼，方可游水。這都是適應環境的緣故。</p>
<p>猛獸的脚，有爪，爲便於裂噬别的動物之用。脚底有厚肉，所以走的時候，没有聲響；跳的時候，不會損傷；像虎，豹，貓，獅等食肉類的脚，都是這樣的。懦笨的獸，脚下有蹄，有的雙蹄，有的單蹄；所以有蹄類動物，分爲偶蹄，奇蹄兩種，像象，牛，羊等，便是有蹄類的動物。</p>
<p>鳥是飛行的動物，有脚還有爪。昆蟲類都是六隻脚。鴨善游水，脚裏生蹼；蛙類亦然；很像行舟的有槳呀。魚的腹鯺，胸鯺像槳，尾鯺像舵，眞是有趣咧。</p>
<p>蛇，蛔蟲，蟯蟲，螩蟲没有脚，全靠身體的蠕動而移動的。蛙，鹿，後脚長，前脚短；所以跳躍極快。蟹八脚，長頸鹿丨也許便是古人所說的『麒麟』丨頸項過高，都是横行的。鳥類前面兩脚，變爲翅膀，所以能够飛了。</p>
<h3 id="c239">布穀鳥 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>

<p>老農感激你；提醒割麥，</p>

<p>你不愧爲益鳥！</p>

<p>— 林軟</p>
<p>小月友丨你們可知道英國大發明家斯蒂文生嗎？你所看見的火車，便是他所發明的。他是採煤公司火夫的兒子，小時候只替人家牧羊，十四歲的時候，他便帮助他父親做事了。但是一面却暗暗裏讀書。後來他的父親死了，全家的衣服，可憐全靠他一個人來負擔的，那時他又死去了他的妻子，他的傷心是說不出的。</p>
<p>但是不怕困難的斯蒂文生，却不顧自己能力的足不足，開始研究科學，第一次他發明煤礦裏的安全燈，第二次，他又發明交通的利器火車了。就在利物浦到孟却斯脫的路公告表演，看的人都喝着采，祝他的成功，但是一八四八年，他就死去了。</p>
<p>小朋友，奮鬥的人，卽使環境不好，也阻撓不住的，</p>
<h3 id="c241">寫給城市中小月友的信 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 許宗傑</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友：</p>
<p>你們的天眞，活潑，快樂，多麽的呌人歆羨，所以我放棄了一個小老頭兒丨丨我已近四十的人了丨丨的資格，成天價和小朋友厮混在一起，做一個年紀最大的老弟弟。</p>
<p>小朋友們！我現在是住在鄉間，也可以稱做鄉下的老弟弟。在初夏的時候，鄉間有些甚麽影色？我們玩些甚麽？不妨報告一些給諸位聽聽。</p>
<p>田裏的秧針，已有二寸來長，成行成列的挿着。菜花已結子了，豌豆也成實了，一種小鳥，呌着快快布穀！快快布穀！四隣年壯的哥兒，開始赤着腿，捋着臂，下田去工作。</p>
<p>我和小朋友們早上已五點多鐘齊起身，在田岸上走着跳着，草間微微有些濕露，東方的太陽，也開始露出它緋紅的臉面。我們看看田中的秧針，看看溪中的蝌蚪，也聽聽那枝頭的鳥鳴。這樣的走了一小時，各自回家去進早餐，上學，做工作。</p>
<p>黄昏，是我們最快樂的時候。一大片柔軟碧綠的草坪，便是我們的遊戲塲，天然椅。好多小朋友在上邊踢着球，或是賽跑，跳高。我們採了許多的野花，編成了王冕，給優勝者戴上。玩倦了便躺在上面，講講故事，唱唱山歌，直等到太陽沉西，喊口號的蝦蟆先生，閣閣閣喊着散會，我們便各自回去。</p>
<p>小朋友們！這一些簡單的報告，你們覺得怎樣？你們願意要嘗試這鄉間的生活嗎？我極歡迎你們的加入，祝你們快樂。你的老弟弟許宗傑上。</p>
<h3 id="c242">地球是什麽樣子的？ <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 寒玉</p>
<p>小朋友！你們可知道地球是什麽樣子的？</p>
<p>地球的形狀，是一個球形。說得更正確些，他的形狀，是像橘子一樣的。小朋友若是不相信地球是圓的，你可到海邊去，遠望從前面來的船。我們先看見船的烟囱，到後來纔能看見船身。你想地球基是平的，應當般身烟囱一起看見，怎會有這種現象呢？</p>
<p>在月蝕的時候，我們能够看見月亮上有圓的影子。這個影子，就是地球反射到月亮上去的影子。黑影是圓的，當然地球也是圓的了。</p>
<p>小朋友也許要問，地球是圓的，而且常常在運動，爲什麽我們一些也不覺得呢？你也以把一個螞蟻捉在皮球上面，把皮球很快的旋轉，但是螞蟻仍舊能够一些也不覺得的向前行走。這是因爲皮球太大，螞蟻太小了。我們就像許多的螞蟻，地球却是一個極大的皮球。</p>

<p>兒童感學的靈敏與否，在先天的生理方面果然有相當關係，但是後天的行爲訓練，却也非常重要；假使一個天資愚笨，感覺遲鈍的兒童，能給予他很適當的訓練，雖然趕不上一個天才兒童，但是，至少可以超越平時不曾受過感覺訓練的兒童。最好的訓練方法，就是遊戲。這送雞蛋的遊戲，就是訓練兒童感覺靈敏的方法之一。</p>
<p>做遊戲的人數，並没有限制，不過太小了要减少些興趣，太多的時候，又會使猜的感到困難，所以最適當是五人至十人。遊戲垢地點，也不限在那裏，室内户外都可以。在未開始以前，先選出一個做送蛋人，一個做猜測人。其餘的人，把兩手背在身後靠牆際。猜測人將眼緊閉，離開靠牆站立的人約十數步。送蛋人凖備小皮球一個，或石子一顆，代表蛋。嘴裏可以唱着：「雞媽媽送蛋有誰要？有誰要？」一面將蛋給任何一個兒童後，再說：「送掉了。猜猜看，猜着送你吃！」猜測人就走近站在牆際的兒童跟前，觀察他們的臉色，猜出是送給誰的。倘若猜中以後，受蛋的就和猜測的互調。猜不中的再重猜，三次猜不中就要罰唱歌，或講故事。送蛋人在送蛋時可以多掉換或贈送後，再授給某一個蛋。受蛋的或未受蛋的兒童，在猜測時，可以故意裝着特異的菜態，使猜測人不易觀察。</p>

<p>鵲呌報喜，鴉鳴兆凶，這是一種迷信，鵲和鴉是個鳥類，它如何知道人的吉凶呢？不過有些人明知道不足爲憑，可是聽得鵲呌，不由表示愉快；聽得鴉鳴，不由表示厭惡；共實鴉知反哺，是個孝鳥，並不是什麽大壞的東西，人偏偏每逢它開口，就要詛咒它，眞要替它不平了。但是鴉鳴是哇哇哇的，帶着一種愁苦之音，令人起不快的感觸，有些厭聽，若是那個鴉不識相，對人點頭磕腦，不斷哇哇呌的，還要拾起石子，抛着將它驅逐，這不是我們常見到的嗎，鵲呌雖然没有什麽特别好，比較的有精神，能動聽，所以少呌無妨，多呌無碍，，總是到處受人歡迎。</p>
<p>小朋友，我們由這上面，可以見到人的說話，也要得法，作文有文法，習字有字法，學畫有畫法，說話怎能没有方法呢？古來小學有「應對之節，」就是研究說話：聖門有「言語一科，」也是注重說話；若是說話不得法，任憑你學問品性，怎樣的好，可是每逢出言，常易招怨招忌，到處碰壁，就同烏鴉一般，開口使人唾棄，怎樣向社會上去挿足呢？</p>

<h3 id="c250">關於托兒所與兒童公育 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 茲九</p>
<p>自上海市有創辦「托兒所」的消息後，引起了一般人的注意。五月十三日本報增刊上，有師石君的「關於托兒所與兒童公育」一文。是反對托兒所的，大意說：「歐美各國的兒童公育，雖已有見諸實施與成效，但以我國現」時的社會情况，國民經濟，文化程度與家庭觀念等。認爲要推行兒童公育，尙有疑」。所持反對的理由，大約不外以不兩點：（一）反對婦女從事職業，不顧育兒。（二）對兒童公育的本身懷疑。</p>
<p>關於第一點師石君謂：「現在中國一般婦女的從事職業，實際上祇是嚮賣短時的靑春，···婚後社會旣不能爲一般育有兒女的母親留着相當的職位，那末托兒所當然亦失去了存在的必要，况婦女有育兒的天職，扶育兒女使身心健全，就是服務社會，而其價値，勝過在機關充當花瓶或商塲中當活牌的職業。」婦女的需要從事職業，卽使抛去主義理論，僅就中國現狀講，連年因帝國主義的侵略，内亂的瀕存，農村破產，市面蕭條，中產以下的家庭婦女，已有不得不向外尋求職業，以圖一飽，於中上人家的婦女，旣已有受教育的機會，一有知識技能，自然她也要發展她的本能，從事於政治，學術，或其他職業，以盡其所能。所以婦女的從事職業，已是現社會下的必然現象了。一方旣有職業婦女，他方旣有代育兒童機關的必要。一方得專心工作，一方得多量教育。喜工作者工作，喜教養兒童者，則教養兒童。對個人可謂分工，對社會可謂合作。至所謂從事職業，祇是出賣短時的靑春，誠屬侮蔑職業婦女之詞，但我們也不能否認，確有許多職業婦女，婚後卽抛了職業，或不能再從事職業，前者是粥少僧多的社會的現象使然，後者原因固不一，但因缺少代育子女之機關，亦有以致之。</p>
<p>關於第二點，師石君以爲因兒童公育，會破壞天倫，所以有「兒童與家庭有不可須臾離的相互關係，兒童是家庭幸福中心···兒孫繞膝才能搆成天倫之樂···家庭又是兒童的樂園，父母之愛，是兒童生命上唯一的糧食，否則便難生存，」師石君還憧憬着兒孫繞膝的那種封建式的安樂鄉，其實人事日繁，謀生不易的現社會下，尙要享這安閒的天倫，中下的人家，事實上已是不可能了。况托兒所與中國固有育嬰堂不同，托兒所養育的兒童，仍得按時歸家，與父母團聚。至於家庭是否兒童的樂園，實屬疑問，而事實告訴我們中國一般的家庭，是兒童的地獄，富者不知教，不知養，只知驕寵；貧者，連養也談不到。且中國兒童，都因習於家庭生活，缺少集團的陶冶，一般散沙似的習性，半由家庭生活所養成。他如父母之愛，固爲兒童的精神糧食，但溺愛與利己的愛丨丨父母視兒女是玩物，是私產丨丨愛之適以害之，不但害及子女個人，且貽患社會，中國兒童死亡率之大，無與比倫，原因固多，但亦不外不會教，不會養，與飢寒之所致，在此情形下，正應有公共的較有科學方法的教養之必要。</p>
<p>關於收費一層，按諸先進國家的通例，多以幼兒父母的收入爲比例，與兒童的數量無關。</p>
<p>師石君末謂：「事實上却徒爲一般沾花惹草的紈袴子弟大開方便之門，結果恐將成爲私生子與姦生子之尾閭。」年來人慾横流，已爲週知的事實，那末私生子與姦生子之泛濫，也許是必然的現象，這種不良的現象，是社會的病態，私生子或姦生子本生是無罪的。况中華民族，前爲四萬萬，現在或不足此數，爲復興民族計，我以爲不管他是私生子或公生子，都有設法使他健全長育之必要。所以我慶幸上海不久將有托兒所的出現，我更希望各都市鄉鎭多多的設立，不過，我希望辦托兒所的，務求科學化，切忌貴族化，更希望爲貧苦兒童大開方便之門。</p>

<p>— 華</p>
<p>七歐文</p>
<p>歐文（Ｒobert　Owen）是英國的一位大空想家，生於一七七一年，逝於一八五八年，這個時候，英國生產中技術的進步，已把大量的熟練手工業者變爲機器附屬品，或是完全排斥於生產以外而代以不熟練的弱婦幼兒，也就是資本主義「罪惡猖獗」的時期，整批整批的靑年兒童，因在工廠裏受着慘苦的剥削而死掉了。歐文生逢斯世，目睹種種慘象，便使他由一個大實業家和人道主義者變爲澈底的社會改良家。</p>
<p>他從事社會改良的範圍，包括很廣，如保護兒童，辦教育，設學校，成立托兒所，保護工廠勞動，開辦醫院，救濟老人與失業者等。歐文爲實現自己的理想，企圖成立一種共產公社，以代替舊的垂死的制度。可是他不懂，勞工的經濟解放和脫離奴隸制度，須是勞工本身的事。歐氏相信，各黨派的「賢明而識見高遠的人，」均可共同地實現必要的改良。</p>
<p>歐文在十歲的時候，他父親令他到鄉下一個商店裏做學徒，後來他在倫敦和曼切斯特兩大都市裏又作事幾年。一七九○年，歐文以十九歲的靑年，做了曼切斯待（此地當時已爲英國的紡織工業中心）</p>
<p>一個大紗廠的經理。越七年，他又聯合友人，在蘇格蘭的一個紐蘭納克地方，用一百二十五萬馬克買了一所紗廠，有男女工人和兒童三千名。此廠便做了他改良社會計劃的試騐所。</p>
<p>歐氏頭一件事，便是注意兒童。他設了好多托兒所，收容半歲以上的小孩，以期减輕有小孩的女工的苦担。他在自己所辦的學校裏取消了賞罰兒童辦法；他的工廠也不收十歲以下的兒童作工：十歲以上者，規定工作時間爲十二半小時，此在當時算是一巨大的進步，因爲那時甚至四歲的一個小孩在工廠裏都要作工十二至十六小時的。</p>
<p>一八二五年，歐文爲實現自己的新社會制度的理想起見，又在美國印第安州購置了一塊土地，成立了一個共產團體，呌做『新恊和社』。歐氏在這里有好多卓絶的男女戰友，内中有個布萊特女士者，在婦女運動上尤起有重大的作用，她個人在『新恊和社』内又成立了一個小團體。在『新恊和社』的試騐失敗後，布萊特女士又奮鬭多年，爭取婦女的平權。</p>
<p>歐文認爲女性是和男子天生而平等的，並没有服從男子的義務，他並且很勇敢地把自己的信念實施於生活，雖然這曾引起社會上對他的狂暴的攻擊，但他仍是不屈的。在『新恊和社』裏，婦女享有選舉權和被選權。他在他兒子所辦的『少年美國』雜誌上，曾發表了自己的十二條要求，内中一條是『男女應當完全平等』。</p>
<p>歐文深信人類最高理想的力量。他企圖造一種新的，更完善的，集體的社會生活制度的榜樣，來對抗當時的殘暴的剥削。不論在那一方面，他都表露了很豐富的思想，此種思想在當時曾爲嘲笑譏刺的對象，而在現在則成了國際社會主義的寳物了。</p>
<p>至歐氏關於婚姻，賣淫，婦女職業，兒童教育等問題的意見，俟下次再說罷。</p>
<h3 id="c252">媚態運動與婦女解放 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 炯</p>
<p>美國的克里扶倫地方，新近正在提倡一種婦女的媚態運動，</p>
<p>據說這種媚態運動的興起，是基於取悅於男子而來的。因爲男人們都覺得：塗脂抺粉的女子，簡直是一座花瓶，没有靈魂似的祇可供人玩賞吧了。這樣不但不能演出活潑的姿態，且對健康上，也有着不良的影響：怎能呌「君子好逑」呢？於是乎她們站在取悅於男人的立塲上，尋出了：（一）因爲嘂肺病的女子，日見增多，非提倡媚態運動，不易却病延年。（二）發揮媚態也就是女子鍜鍊身體的機會，使身體日見健康，病魔無從侵入。（三）女子拿脂粉來裝飾面孔不算是美，必須具有妖媚的姿態纔算十足的美。（四）須從媚態上痛下工夫，然後可到處受着男子們的追求。這些理由，而發動了媚態之動：到處開演講會，貼標語，甚且各個婦女團體都附設有媚態專修學校，教育見男子之媚，向愛人之媚，對丈夫之媚，以及叙情之媚，戀愛之媚，問候之媚，告别之媚，行走之媚等，使其成爲一取悅男人的能手而後已。難道說這對於婦女解放運動能有所補益麽？</p>
<p>我們知道婦女之所以居於被壓迫的地位者，是由於社會制度經濟條件所使然，這，祗要我們翻一翻社會進化史及婦女解放運動史，便可明白個底細。而美利堅的娘子們竟在嗜飽了脂粉味之後，翻個新花樣：他們滿以爲從媚態上痛下工夫，到處受着男子們的追求，顯示她們的健康，嬌傲，便算解放（？）這簡直是欺人自欺的笑話！</p>
<p>我們如果是以爲從西洋來的東西，總是「摩登」的，而把這媚態學了來，那我們這二萬萬在雙重壓迫下的婦女，就不啻自已解除了武器，取消了要求解放的戰鬥的陣營了。因爲這種媚態運動，出現在我們眼前的，是一個取悅於男人的姿態。是一塊阻礙婦女解放運動的前途的巨石。是一杯麻醉的湯藥。因此，我們應該堅决地防堵這媚態運動的侵入，而更堅强我們婦女運動的陣綫，從經濟上，政治上去努力奮鬥，然後才能獲得眞正的解放啊！</p>

<p>— 蕪</p>
<p>不久之顡　，美國南大科州（Ｓ·Ｄakota）發生了一椿轟動社會的雙生子能彀有兩個父親的奇案，而且當地法庭，爲了這事情，還開了世界上從未有過的新判例。讀者們，你們相信嗎？這確是眞的呢，因爲在那個州的蒲里曼村裏有個農民名呌亞德瓦巴德的，他有兩個一胎生的孩子，其中一個的容貌和巴德很酷肖，而另一個，却一些也不像巴德，所以巴德很懷疑，又因他的妻曾和别人姘居，巴德拿到了証據，于是爭執就開始了。巴德說：他只能對他自己的孩子（就是那個面貌相像的）盡父親的義務，至還有那一個，决不是他的孩子，只能讓母親去負責。結果，他們兩口兒就閙到了州裏的法庭上，自然，巴德的理由是很充足的，法庭經數度訊問，推事杜利伯終于宣判了准于巴德的請求，由夫婦分負兩子的扶養。照這麽說來，雙生子不是眞能有兩個父親了嗎？</p>

<p>「你是不對！」</p>
<p>先生：</p>
<p>第十期婦女園地上登載着你底一段悲史，末了，，你說；『有誰肯對我說「你是對的」，或「你是不對」嗎』？據我運用我所有的淺薄的知識來『批判』（？）我敢肯定地說：『你是不對！』</p>
<p>請你不要疑心我是在抺着良心說話。在替我底同性辯護。</p>
<p>第一：我覺得當你們正開始相愛着的時候，你當然得運用你所有的能力去觀察你底對象。現在的報章雜誌上不是充滿着婚姻欺騙的新聞嗎？你能够驟然相信你底對象不會就是那些新聞裏的主角嗎？細看你底「婦人心」你却似乎並没有注意到這一點。</p>
<p>第二：你旣然知道了在你們相愛不久之前，他曾熱戀着另外一個女人；你就應當去探知他的爲何同他第一個戀人破裂和如何同他第一個戀人破裂。當然，他會用欺騙的不正當手段來同你脫離，他底同他第一個戀人的脫離手段也一定不外乎仍舊是欺騙的或其他的不正當的方法。但據你說，你却知道了」據說是她不肯答應他的要求，便破裂了。」這一點。</p>
<p>他會因爲他底第一個戀人不答應他的或種要求而和她破裂，你能擔保他不會因你不答應他再另愛一個女人的要求而和你破裂嗎？</p>
<p>第三：你底好友旣然警告你『你能相信他不會再去熱戀第三個女人嗎？』你爲什麽又驟然相信呢？他會打碎他先生送給他的寳貴的琵琶，就表示着他是一個善于忘記朋友的傢伙。會寫血書者往往就是意志最薄弱的人。會用死來要挾的人也就是人類中最壞的敗類。你不能爲了他的血書就感動；你不能爲了他的「死」就抛棄你底懷疑和猶豫。死！你不知道許多東北的同胞被暴日慘殺列死嗎？你不知道許多西北的同胞被天災淹餓死嗎？你不知道許多圓顱方趾的平民被武人槍殺死嗎？死了一個會打碎他先生送他的寳貴的琵琶而用之以騙取異性的愛情的人有什麽了不得呢！</p>
<p>還有第四：你不能恨你底心爲什麽不「狠」不「毒」。你底失敗並不在於你底心的不「狠」不「毒」，而在於你底腦袋欠理智化！你底心太容易感動。</p>
<p>有此四點，所以我敢說你不對。但是，先生，你是湖南人，湖南人和廣東人同是我國最勇敢的人，最善進取的人，最會革命的人，和最有希望的人。敬祝你能利用我湖南人的血液去打破你前途的渺茫！</p>

<h3 id="c287">我們需要怎樣的選舉 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 立秋</p>
<p>最近幾週以來，公樸先生在本刊上曾幾次提了了關於改良選舉的問題。自然，這一問題目前不僅在促進市政或地方自治等實際情形上具有重要的意義，同時，就在中國整個的政治改造上說來，都是一個待解决的重要問題。</p>
<p>儘管中國過去的許多次選舉，是在不健全的情形之下而失敗了，但是，這絶不能說是「選舉」本身的罪過。因爲選舉只是一種方法，凡是人們要將社會事務之最後的裁判權操在多數人手裏的時候，則除了選舉的方法而外，根本上再也没有旁的方法了。</p>
<p>所以，現在我們要求地方自治與改良選舉，實際上卽是要救民治精神的發揮，我們以爲這是從政治改造上挽救民族危機之最低限度的工作。</p>
<p>因而，現在的問題，不是我們需不需要改良選舉，主要的是我們需要怎樣的選舉。關於這點，我以爲：</p>
<p>第一，我們需要的是普選丨丨近代選舉權之逐漸擴張，已經使過去的階級選舉進步到普通選舉了。因此，我們要求廢際宗教，經濟，社會，性别的一切限制。除了未成年的兒童，神經病的患者及剥奪了公權的人而外，人人都能有參加選舉的義務與權利。</p>
<p>第二，我們要求選舉實權的擴大丨丨選舉權之價値，主要的要在民選官吏的數目上才能表現出來。人民之參加選舉，不只是替政府選出諮詢機關，同時，更重要的是要選出能代表他們意見的人，直接參加一切國家或地方重大問題之澈底解决和執行。所以，我們要求選舉的實權應當擴大，同時，還要救創制，複决，罷免等權的實施丨因爲這三者是有連帶關係的。</p>
<p>第三，在選舉方法上的注意丨丨我們知道：選舉權的價値和效力與投票方法有很大的關係。公開選舉，不能充分發揮選舉者的意志，同時「圈定的」選舉方式根本失掉了選舉的意義。現在，各國的選舉制度，都差不多改爲無記名投票制度了，因此，我們也要求在中國的一切選舉上實用這一選舉的方式。</p>
<p>第四，應當實施强制選舉丨丨選舉權不僅是人民的一種權利，同時也是一種義務。選舉是一種公共職務，國家對於人民的這種職務，必須用盡方法使之履行。我國大多數人，過去對於選舉往往漠不開心，一方面給土豪劣紳和野心的政客所操縱，同時，又使人民對於政治毫無興趣，所以，我們主張，政府應當效法比利時，荷蘭，捷克，西班牙等國家，實施强迫選舉制度，規定不參加選舉者須受經濟上或名譽上之某種懲罰。</p>
<p>第五，要求嚴格的選舉舞弊法律丨丨選舉舞弊是我國過去的一種通常現象，現在，我們不談選舉則已，一談選舉，在積極方面，我們要求提高一般人民的政治水平，在消極方面，我們要求一個嚴格的選舉舞弊法律。國家須用法律規定凡賄賂，欵待，威嚇，冐名，以及非法利用選舉費，或選舉運動者，都須給以嚴格的懲處。</p>
<p>上列幾項，是我們改良選舉之最低限度的要求。有人說這只是一個不能實現的高調，其實，我們知道，倘若工使一個選舉能够眞正代表民意，要使一個選舉的結果，能够得到大多數民衆的擁護，除了以上列幾點爲基礎的選舉以外，我們還有什麽更好的方法呢？所以，我們希望辦選舉的當局，應當以此爲目標去促進健全的選舉之實施。無論是中央的政治，地方自治以及社會團體，倘若不能有完善的健全的選舉，則一切理想都是不能達到的丨</p>
<p>誠然，「有選舉勝於無選舉」，但是，僅僅「有選舉」還是不够的，我們還要在「有選舉」之中要求更加完善的選舉啊！</p>

<h3 id="c288">血飯 <a href="#c288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— 龍萊</p>
<p>生存在這「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨」的不合理的社會裏，一般嗅不到酒肉，輾轉在飯寒死亡綫上的人，爲了要活，有的就不得不忍痛着廉價地拍賣自己的勞動力，有的甚至於賤賣了親生的兒女，硬拿自己身體上的血液去換得殘羹冷飯來飽肚皮，這就是這兒要說的一般給高貴的人們雇用去做奶媽的勞苦婦女了。</p>
<p>只消走到北平的「傭工介紹所」，上海的「薦頭店」，或是成都的「人巿」，重慶的「會府」這些地方過趟路，我們就會瞧見這般「賣人血者」展覽品樣地，排排地蹲着，坐着等待出賣。噙着離夫别子之苦淚的眼飢餓地關心地釘着過往的行人，好容易等到一個主顧走進來，就唯恐差池地把一對茄子樣的奶子，直挺挺地捧出來任憑人們擇肥選瘦地檢騐，摸擦。結果，得售者就又悲又喜，跟着主人去了（多半要去受醫生的血液檢騐）。被挑剩選餘了撇下來的呢，就垂頭喪氣地再等待主顧。這一切誰見了不感到是一齣悽慘的悲劇？「賣人血者」比起一般出賣勞動者不還要可憐些嗎？</p>
<p>自然，要拿自己的血水給貴人們的公子小姐去吮吸，首先得把自己親生的兒女抛在一邊：較好的是花點錢寄託在别人屋裏，或是留在家中喂米湯，否則的話，無可寄託或没人招料，就只得忍着痛，乾脆送給别人跟抛棄在路畔或弄口了。這樣地去做奶媽的人，當她抱着人家的孩子哺喂自己的奶水時，心上該如何深沉地感着慘痛呀！尤其是看着别人的孩兒張着小嘴向自己笑，伸着小手身自己招得可愛的時候。</p>
<p>拿責任跟工作來說，奶媽和普通一般的娘姨大姐表面上似乎没有什麽區分，而實際上却比之娘姨大姐艱苦更大的多了。她們不但負着哺喂孩子的職責，而且還得担當孩子的發育，健康，疾病，衛生等等的重任，因此她們一經被人雇用，身體跟行動方面就完全失掉了自由。記得有過這樣的悲喜劇：有個兩夫婦都自命爲教育家的公館裏，女主人天天督責着奶媽在她老共瓜皮樣的臉兒上，擦些雪花膏，搽些水粉，說是她的臉子生得太醜，女孩吃她的奶，恐怕將來要　她。這樣一來，她那被霜風吹粗，因勞動而憔悴的臉皮就給雪花膏跟粉醃漬得發燒發痛了，結果她對着鏡子，哭也不是，笑也不是。說到行動，那簡直同牢獄的囚犯没有兩樣，因爲小少爺或小姐，不能半天一夜不吃奶，她們就老是一年半載不得回家，明明是有夫之婦，可是主人偏偏要她守「活寡」。不僅這樣，就是隨便在街上或是鄰居家裏走走也得被干涉的。要是孩子偶爾傷了風，打個噴嚏，那末主人更要責駡她抱着孩子亂走所以遭凉了，勵害一點的主人還得拿「扣工錢」，「滾蛋」這些來壓制她。</p>
<p>換洗孩子的衣服，尿布，抱着孩子玩，喂奶，不分晝夜地搖搖籃，這是做奶媽的一般的工作，另外，買菜，煮飯，</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>做針綫這些也不得不做。如果孩子稍爲大點，漸漸地長了牙，睡眠的時間减少了，勉强能够爬行的時候，這時奶媽的工作，可就不輕鬆的了，隨時隨地得留心地防禦他跌倒，連睡覺的時候也不得擅離職守。這時候的孩兒，一舉一動都不像初生時那樣的規矩，拿他吃奶來說吧，在他將要生出小牙齒之前，吃奶時會緊緊地咬着奶子摩擦牙齦，旣出之後，又要用他瓜子大的幾辦新牙來撕咬奶頭，常常把奶媽撕咬得臉上起了痙攣，但她却不得怨恨一句，酸淚只好悄悄地往肚子裏硬嚥下去。人吃人呀，這眞是！</p>
<p>到了八九個月的孩子，食量也比先前增加了，奶媽總是虚心地怕自己的乳汁不能滿足他，同時一方面還得慇懃地對主人表示她的奶好丨丨害怕飯碗發生問題。因此無論白天或是夜裏只要孩子一哭，她就馬上把奶子塞進他的嘴裏，讓那吸血哭慢慢地吮吸，縱然有時候吸疼了她的肉，吞空了她的血，她得忍住痛苦。</p>
<p>狼籍杯盤裏的殘湯剩菜，便是主人給與奶媽的唯一的飲食，穿着是他們壓箱櫃底子的發了霉的舊衣舊褲。至於她們的工資，最高的也不過十塊錢，六塊或八塊是最流行的時價。如果她們自己的孩子還留着請人替養的話，那末，除開自己孩子的養育費，所賺得的冷飯殘羹外，只是一身貧血的瘦骨了，這是「賣血者」的代價，這是吃血飯者的生活。</p>
<h3 id="c289">國文教師 <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— 文宇</p>
<p>人們都知道國文教師是教書匠中最辛苦酌一種人，但展開在他們生活上的到底是怎樣一幅勞瘁的圖畫，是人們未必全淸楚的。在過去的一年中，我有這榮幸，能在本市的一個私立中學裏作過這麽一位先生。我不能說我眞有多少的體騐，但我不否認我確有若干的觀察。</p>
<p>首先，我需要提出的，是社會上對這輩教書先生的不正確的觀念。他們以爲教育是淸高的，便以爲教師，特别是國文教師，是不曾染上一些人間烟火氣的高人逸士。但事實是絶對的相反，他們不但不是什麽高人逸士，不但和一般人一樣需要麵包，且不得不爲麵包作劇烈的生存鬥爭。在這人才過剩？）時代，爲抓緊自己的飯碗，他們不得不用種種方法提防着競爭者丨雖欲淸高亦不可得。</p>
<p>現在我且在這裏展示他們生活的灰暗面。不顧健康，不顧能力，他們是常兼着兩個三個甚至四個以上學校的課。他們有教課多至五六班的。論鐘點，有每週任課三十六小時的。完全是把身體當作機哭般的在使用着。這裏幾乎全談不上教學效率；我們只見一羣混飯吃的人在掙扎中蠕動而已。</p>
<p>這原因顯然是待遇上的過分菲薄，兼之以欠薪，以致他們每月辛勞所得，尙時有不能養活家口之虞。在這種情况下，有什麽好法子呌他們注意教學效率，少担任些鐘點呢？</p>
<p>按照中國目前教育界的普通情形，他們辛勞的代價是按時　値的，依着公私立學校的性質上以及那學校的發展程度上的差别，而不岂其酬報數目。目前上海有這樣的情形：一個僅有一兩年歷史，學生一百人左右的中學，教師是很難支到薪水，雖然聘書上或許規定着每小時應可領到五角大洋的。他們也不一定完全是「盡義務」，因爲學校到底也替他解决了「食」　「宿」等生活問題。至少是有不出錢而可住一旅館」的好處，可以說是「半義務」性質的。有時，出乎意料之外的，或許每月還可支五元到十元的「車馬費」。</p>
<p>局面較大一點的私立中學，五角錢一個鐘頭的「束修」，國文教師是穏可拿到的。若你在這樣一個學校教每週六小時某一級的國文；則你可到手十二元，這算是你撈到了一筆「香烟錢」。</p>
<p>「老牌」一點的私立中學，國文教師每小時可到手七角至八角錢。有一個我所知道的學校就是這樣：初中一，每小時七角，初中二，七角五分，初中三，八角。（本篇所述多係初中情形。）一塊錢一點鐘的私中，在上海是頂少的。公立初中則大都可到此數目。總之，這和外埠有些省分初中國文教師每小時可支一元，或一元二角五，或一元半的情形是完全不同的了。</p>
<p>待遇雖是這樣的低，但却要求他們加倍的辛勞。國文教師的改削國文課卷，需要比上課更多的時間。没有一個國文教師不對着一些半通不通的卷子頭痛的。平常一個並非老資格的國文教師　一點鐘大槪只能改三四本，效率大一些的也只能改六七本。不過這中間有許多「偷懶」的方法，　就是　目　　　　　　　　記叙文容易改，論文最難。最好是議學生們作　大同小異（甚至千　一律），比如你呌他們照你給的「大綱」寫，或呌他們把一篇文言翻成白話，或作一篇一百多字的「隨筆」等。最省事的是你說一篇短故事呌他們記下來，或提出課文内一篇短文，呌他們删去可省的句子，把這篇文字縮短了。改這樣的卷子十二三本甚至十五六本，僅需要你一小時的時間。記得有一次北新書局爲推銷牠的「混合國語」和「北新文選」招待本市各中學國文教師的席上，有一位身體很好的先生，說他一點鐘可改十五六本卷子，我推想到他或者就是用的這種省事的方法！</p>
<p>有人或者要責備這種先生的不負責，但他們實在也是没有辦法的。他們不但太忙，也太疲倦。平常一位國文教師每週任課二十小時不算多，兩班國文兼任歷史或地理，每天已有三四小時的課堂講授，這使他們不得不帶了疲倦的身體回到家裏，呆對着桌上一百本以上（每班五六十人很普通）的半通不通的卷子發愁。何况一個兼課的國文教師任的鐘點比二十小時還要多呢？</p>
<p>在這樣的情形下，决難有時間從事研究工作的。他們的講授内容不得不貧乏得可憐。他們不得不敷衍學生，討好學生，這樣的先生不得不是一位「馬虎」的先生。這裏還談得到教學效率嗎？</p>
<p>爲了免除「誤人子弟」起見，這樣的先生我是再也不想當了。但是社會不能給人更好的事作，從大學裏所販來的知識，這社會又完全用不着，自己又無别種「專門」，爲了某種必要，雖心裏不想害人，又怎樣可能呢？</p>

<p>— 倉玉</p>
<p>大約在五年前吧，我就被介紹到這個打鐵間裏來了。在我們之中，認爲得到工作是像讀書的人得到官做的情形一樣。</p>
<p>這就是我們工作的地方：沙地上，用鐵板圈着的東一堆西一堆燃着的煤火，被地下通來的鼓風管子裏的風吹着，火燃得非常猛烈，熱度也昇到極高度，同時那黑色的煤灰和黄色的煤烟也一齊飛揚起來了，因爲上面有屋頂，兩邊又有牆壁，於是這間房子的空氣全被這烟灰和煤烟所籠罩着，佔據着了。我剛到這裏工作的時候，眞使人難過得要命，因爲灰和烟的侵襲，眼睛整天的被迫着流眼淚，鼻腔和肺部受着怪味的刺激，呼吸簡直失了常態，但現在却似乎習慣得不覺得了。遇到落雨的天氣，灰和烟出不到門，更使人難受。尤其到了夏天，二十幾堆的猛烈的煤火燒着，如果不是習慣了的人，不熱死也會悶死的。</p>
<p>同其他部份的工人一樣，在七點鐘的時候就開始工作。我們是兩三個人一組，每組佔有一堆煤火，一個鐵凳。我們先將碎煤堆得緊緊的，然後鑿開幾個洞，讓風吹出來，火就可以燃得猛烈了。於是將要做的東西的熟鐵埋到煤火裏面去，用大鉗子夾着，候至燒到一定的成色，就將這堆煤弄開，這時熱氣和怪味一齊冲出來，再用冷水一澆，灰和烟馬上飛揚了，但我們絲毫不敢怠慢地就要把那燒紅的鐵夾到鐵凳上，叮叮噹噹，你一錘，我一錘的打着，打過後，讓它冷了，再放進去燒，燒了又錘，這</p>

<p>— 森君</p>
<p>這是資本社會的一件趣聞。美國勒維阿台州首都里諾這個地方，从地理上看來，不過是貧瘠的西部山地的一個小都會，但他却是世界聞名的離婚市，正和摩納哥是世界聞名的賭博國一　。</p>
<p>思倫特法官，曾在里諾的離婚法庭，十二年中許可了二萬件離婚申請的人，當他六十三歲退職時，他說：「結婚的三分之二是失敗的外科手術，只有離婚。」</p>
<p>「到里諾來離婚罷，把你結婚的幸福再恢復過來！」</p>
<p>在美國，四十八州的法律都各不相同。有的　以爲「神的結合，人不可以使牠離散」，桑斯，加洛萊拉州就絶對不許離氏；哥倫比亞地方，只有姦通事件就許離婚。大多數的州以重犯，遺棄，虐待，等爲離婚理由，申請離婚有居住期間」的必要過程，非在一定地方居住一年到三年不可。可是在勒維阿台州，離婚手續都極簡單。</p>
<p>使勒維阿台州有名的東西，不是雪拉·勒維阿台（西班牙語是有雪的山脈的意思）的雪，不是原始森林，不是鑛山業，而是輕便迅速的離婚法。里諾和巴黎，墨西哥巿合起來，稱世界三大離婚都，同時現在的里諾，也以賭博著名。</p>
<p>約在七十年前，許多人爲了鑛山業到里諾來了，只要居留六個月，就獲得了完全的市民權。</p>
<p>照勒維阿台的離婚法，要是以遺弃，不養育，虐待，申請離婚，而没有抗告的話，就許可單獨離婚；而且離婚後馬上可以再婚。由事都喜歡迅速的美國，這不是没有緣故的。想要離婚的都跑到里諾來，只要住六個月，就可以受到當地法律的恩惠了。</p>
<p>這件事的特别興旺，是在十一二年前開始的，大部分離婚來客都是富有階級，每年總有千人以上，爲此而消耗的金銀達二百萬元，在這一小地方看來，眞是一筆不小的進欵。</p>
<p>因爲大部份富有階級來此游歷並離婚，賭博和跳舞的繁盛也是當然的，但因此來者又更多了。</p>
<p>後來，離婚必要的居住期間六個月减到三個月了，這樣，來客遂愈益增多。</p>
<p>現在把减短居住期間後以及未减以前的外來離婚數字比較一下，就可槪見：</p>
<p>减短之前一九二五年——八○六件</p>
<p>减短之後一九二七年——一，六○三件</p>
<p>全美國經濟不景氣，鑛山業，鐵道工業都不振，里諾許多失業者都改營旅館業，生意倒很好。</p>
<p>一九三一年五月一日以來，三個月居住期間又改爲六週間了，這一來，隣州阿岡蘇和埃台霍的失業者都走到里諾來，分享富有者的浪費。</p>
<p>上等酒，上等的歌舞，總到里諾來，當每年獨立祭（七月四日）的時候，還舉行大鬥拳。　　最近的里諾，每天有一八九件離婚案，而每件離婚案經過六分鐘至十分鐘就辦理完竣了。</p>
<p>辯護士一年可得百萬元，裁判所一年二十六萬元，公共賭博場每週收入百萬元，一年五千二百萬元。</p>
<p>因爲離婚後馬上可以再婚，有不少本地人因而暴富的，一個小菜店的店主竟成爲百萬富豪的女人的對手，賣花姑娘也可勾上名士。</p>
<p>還有點小事，也是値得一記的，就是有許多富有者常把結婚指環抛在里諾的特拉基河裏，一些失業者和遊民一到夜裏就到河裏面淘指環換飯吃。</p>

<p>日裏八個半鐘頭的工作之外，還須得做夜工。但，不作夜工却又是我們絶不願的一回事，你想，我們七八角錢一天的工資好做什麽？不作夜工會連家都養不活！工作愈是低下，工資愈是微少；工資愈是微少，我們愈是希望多作夜工。總之，我們是在同生活拚命啊！</p>
<p>鐵錘一天一天的打着，日曆也一頁一頁的飛去，五年，很快的就過去了。這期間，我想我們錘出了不少的東西，它們總相當地爲人們造些幸福，爲一些人賺得利潤；但是，我們呢？仍舊是「手膀舉酸了」，「手揑痛了」，「汗也出足了」地拍賣勞力！而且，這打鐵間到現在又增加了一些伙伴，更多圍了幾堆煤火了。鐵錘的聲音比從前更響亮些，煤灰和煤烟也比從前更濃密了。</p>

<h3 id="c292">英日在貿易上的衝突 <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— 雪友</p>
<p>凡是留心到最近國際消息的，對於最近英日商戰的短兵相接以及英日會商的完全失敗，想來不會疏略過去的吧！這裏我們試把這英日商戰的始末簡明地叙述一下。</p>
<p>日本自一九三一年放棄了金本位以來，利用着「金元跌價」的手段，積極地把貿易向世界擴張下去。其結果，一九三二年的輸出貿易額比前一年增加了二億六千三百萬元，總額達十四億一千萬元。一九三三年更積阿邁進，比三二年又增加了四億五千一百萬元，總額達十八億六千一百萬元。這使號稱世界貿易第一位的大英帝國不得不眼紅。</p>
<p>單只是日本貿易額逐漸增大，還不要緊。不幸的是，日本的輸出品有四分之一是專門運銷到英本國及其自治領和殖民地去的。換言之，在一九三三年，日貨之輸往大英帝國的竟達四億八千四百萬日元。其中尤以輸往印度的貨物爲多，達二億零五百萬日元，幾佔大英帝國對日輸入全部的二分之一。</p>
<p>更不幸的是：英國一向是以棉織品稱覇世界的</p>
<p>，對於英屬自治領和殖民地也一向是以棉織品爲輸出的大宗。日本剛剛與英國相抵，牠輸往英屬自治領和殖民地的貨物也正是以棉織物爲中心。計棉織物一項，在一九三三年，從日本輸往英屬各地的，共達一億四千九百萬元（八億七千七百萬平方碼）。印度一域最多，達七千一百萬日元（四億五千一百萬平方碼）。</p>
<p>在同期間，英國輸向印度的棉織物爲四億八千五百萬平方碼。這與日本對印輸出額幾乎相等。</p>
<p>爲了保護自國的棉織工業，爲了鞏固大英經濟集團的勢力起見，英國不得不設計抵禦日本的狂烈襲擊。一九三二年八月，英政府慫恿印度政府修改棉織品的進口關稅，結果日本的棉織品受到從百分之三十一增加到百分之五十的重稅，而英國棉織品的進口稅，仍爲百分之二十五。至一九三三年四月，英外長西門又通知駐英日大使松平，謂將把一九○四年所締結的印日商約於翌年廢止。九月二十五日，日印雙方代表齊集於印度西姆接，會議了半個月，終於得不出結果。後於十月二十三日改在德里舉行會議，幾經磋商，纔於今年一月五日成立了一個恊定。根據這個恊定，日本每年向印度輸出的棉織品不得超過四億平方碼，而日本每年須向印度購買生棉一百五十萬包。日本棉織品進口稅仍爲百分之五十。</p>
<p>日本與印度間的貿易糾紛旣經解决。於是更進一步來談判日本與大英帝國間的貿易問題。今年二月十四日英日民間棉業會議在倫敦開幕，兩方面出席的代表都是各該國的棉業巨子。談判了足足一個月，却終於爲了對於地域適用問題（英國主張，恊議範圍，應包括英日以外第三國之市塲，而日本却主張只限於英本國及其殖民地）而宣告决裂。民間會議决裂以後，於是全部的問題乃移轉到兩國政府來解决。來回磋商了許久，終於得不到頭腦；至本月三日英商相任錫曼以備忘錄交與駐英日大使松平，於是兩國政府間的磋商亦告决裂矣。</p>
<p>英日兩國政府的會商旣告决裂，英政府乃動員全部自治領與殖民地恊力排斥日貨。英日商戰正式開始了。（最近澳外相藍山赴日與廣田外相作初步的貿易談判，現在雖無正式結果，然而由於澳洲是英國自治領地的關係，將來恐怕也没有圓滿的結果。）英國的保守黨（在現内閣中勢力最大）雖然還夢想着「英日同盟」的迷夢，然而事實已是昭然：英國的棉織界再也忍受不了日本的襲繫，此後唯有短兵相接地從事商戰的肉搏而已。</p>
<p>對於英國在新加坡和南洋各地的軍事佈置，對於英荷秘密會議的由來，以及關於日本反對「國際援華」聲中的英國態度，···我們只有從這英日在貿易上之衝突的事實中，纔能把握到眞義。</p>

<h3 id="c293">自學文學——的！幾個基本問題 <a href="#c293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— 楚</p>
<p>（一）如何覓得研究的門徑</p>
<p>雖然我們研究的出發點是正在活躍中的具象的文學運動，範圍大槪以中國現存的創作及譯品爲界限，是一個較仄的領域。但從事研究之初步的人，應如何來覓得研究的道路呢？這是一個當前的間題。</p>
<p>研究文學從文學史入乎，然後依照文學的流變，挨次去探求各支流，是一種由縱到横的研究法，不失爲自學的一種良法。但在這裏，我們有許多困難：因爲目下成爲我們的對象的是常在變化中的文學，是錯綜複雜矛盾混和的綜合。對這現象就缺少有系統的，像過去文學史那樣較固定的意見與决定。而我們要覓的自學的道路，仍然要去找活的史料，要勤於窺探文壇的組織與行動的消息，要蒐集出版界與各種文學的，非文學的刊物上關於文壇的論文，雜著，批判，軼聞等史料，豐富自已的見解。你從這些材料中，可以看出文學活動之主流與傾向來。你可以對當前複雜的現象有較正確的處理，而不致迷失自己前進的道路。自然，展在你前面的這一條道路，還要由你的意議來决定。</p>
<p>（二）如何增加鑑别的能力</p>
<p>爲了要使自己對現代作品有相當認識的能力，你應有文藝理論的知識。要了解某一派的作品，最好先讀一切關於某一派的文藝理論。理論雖然是從事實歸納出來的，但一種科學的行動是以過去行動中集聚起來的知識作爲理論的出發點。所以科學的行動，是有理論爲其前導的。</p>
<p>我們應有下面幾種基本的知識：</p>
<p>一，關於藝術論</p>
<p>二，關於文藝思潮</p>
<p>三，關於文藝的社會根據</p>
<p>四，關於美學···等較　　專門的研究</p>
<p>這一部分研究，要佔重大的比重，爲研究文學之中心點。由此，你可以完成第一項中應履行的任務。</p>
<p>對於以上諸方面，自然還可以作爲單獨的專門的研究。</p>
<p>祇有這一部分工作做得充分，你才可以發揮你的威力。</p>
<p>（三）文學與其他科學</p>
<p>文學並不是與其他科學無關聯的，孤立的東西。恰恰相反，牠與社會科學及其他的科學都保有了適當配合的關聯。如果要研究文藝理論，就需要有較厚的社會科學及其他科學的基礎。一個缺乏社會科學研究的人，他也不能眞的了解文學，或爲文學者。</p>
<p>一個作家與一個讀者一樣都應深植自己的基礎，同時把自己所學，應用到文學上去？</p>
<p>下面幾種科學，你必須趕快學習。</p>
<p>一，爲了解剖現代社會的，經濟學的基本知識，</p>
<p>二，爲了了解社會進化的道程的，社會學的基本知識；</p>
<p>三，爲了了解社會意識的，社會意識形態的基本知識；</p>
<p>四，關於科學的宇宙觀，世界觀及人生觀這些主題的哲學的基本知識。</p>
<p>（四）文學與生活</p>
<p>文學離不開生活。要了解一篇現代作品，縱令具有以上的理論，如果脫離了實踐的生活，就不能把握時代的重心，且有變成機械論或行而上學的危險。所以一個作家，和一個讀者，同樣應在實踐的生活上去了解文學。</p>

<p>在第一五年計畫時期中，亞麻耕地的面積約擴大了一倍，比大戰前擴大了二點七倍。同時在歐洲别的國家中，這種面積却减少到一半以上（百分之六十）。在一九三二年，蘇聯的亞蔴產量佔全歡總產量百分之九十。</p>
<p>亞蔴塲面積之大量的增加，是由於蘇聯農業之社會的和經濟的變動而奠其基礎的。</p>
<p>至於荣蔴耕地的面積，現已增大到八十萬海克脫爾（Hectares，法國地積量名，）大戰前則僅有六十八萬海克脫爾。</p>
<p>在第一五年計畫剛開始的時候，亞麻和苧麻的主要生產者是個體農人（Ｉndividual　Peasants），那時（一九二八年）集體農塲的麻產量僅佔總產量千分之六。到一九三二年，集體農塲和國營農塲已成爲亞麻和苧麻的主要生產者，其出產量也已達到總產量百分之六十五以上了。</p>
<p>在亞麻和苧麻的種植上特别需要的是耕種機站。在一九三二年有二百六十一個這種專爲種植亞麻和苧麻而設的耕種機站。有七千五百九十三架耕種機在五十萬海克脫爾亞麻耕地上（佔歐洲其餘國家的一倍）和八萬海克脫爾苧麻耕地上活動着。</p>
<p>這許多耕種機站都是用最近代的農業機械裝配而成，這裏有訓練得最好的政治監察者，經營者和農村經濟的勢力丨丨這些都是使麻產大量增加的有力工具。</p>
<p>國營農塲和集體農塲（大半都在有耕種機站的區域内）現有一萬五千個受過良好訓練的打麻工人。</p>
<p>爲了增加亞麻產量的努力所得到的結果，不僅是亞麻耕地的面積擴大了，就是收成上也有顯著的增加，可送到市塲上去的麻產數目自然也更加增大了。</p>
<p>關於麻的採購的方法，現在和從前是完全不同的。在市塲交易價格不定的情形下，需要由國家規定在契約上予生產者（集體的或個體的都一樣）以借墊的例利，而由後者供給棉產於國家。在這些契約内，國家予生產者以生產上的必要補助，如供給他們以農業機器，礦質肥料，穀物，經過選擇的種子，以及信用上的和金錢上的墊欵等。同時麻業生產者從事耕種一定量面積的麻塲，視這種耕種所要求的農業技術上的消費情形，規定於一定期間内把那質地精美的收成之幾分之幾貢納於國家。</p>
<p>亞麻的這種借墊契約是一九二七年開始試行的，苧麻的則開始試行於一九二九年。在這期間耕地面積上僅是從百分之九到百分之十四試行這辦法。到一九三一年和一九三二年用這辦法耕種的面積已增到全麻塲百分之八十四以上了。</p>
<p>關於麻的採集，蘇聯政府是單獨特設了一個麻業部經管的。這裏常計畫怎樣增高產量和改良品質的事情。</p>
<p>第一五年計畫所賦予麻業生產者的課題，是要使麻的耕地面積大大的擴張，這一點恰好是有了如所願的發展。一九三三年計畫中所規定的二百三十萬海克脫爾的亞麻塲和八十六萬海克脫爾的苧麻塲是毫無困難的實現了的。亞麻的產量在一九三三年已增加了百分之二十，卽全產量一年中有五十五萬噸。</p>

<h3 id="c295">天眞的兒童　天國之最大使者 <a href="#c295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— 王約翰</p>
<p>兒童是偉大的，所以古今的哲人和詩人都崇拜兒童。</p>
<p>孟子說：『大人者不失赤子之心。』耶蘇說：『兒童是天國之最大使者。』老子說：『專致弱如嬰兒。』歌德更說：『我們應以他們（兒童）爲師。』大思想家馬克思亦常說：『我對於基督聖經最注意的地方，是其對於小孩的大友愛之情。』</p>
<p>兒童何以這樣値得崇拜呢？對於兒童的崇拜到底是出成人的一時高興呢？抑是成人眞的在兒童身上發現成人所没有的偉大呢？兒童的體力勝成人乎？智力勝成人乎？經騐思想勝成人乎？</p>
<p>我們要了解兒童的眞實偉大，是不能用常人的見解去衡量兒童的，我們須從兒童本身上去體會兒童的偉大。美國的兒童心理學家荷爾氏（Ｈall）說：『兒童時期是人類的天國，成人生活是從此而墮落。』這是一點都不錯的。我們成人所有的智慧，是不脫奴隸偏見的，我的所有的習慣和過去一切傳統都和夢魔一樣的壓迫着我們活人的腦子。成人自幼年而至於死，都不脫奴隸的覊軛，我們有什麽資格去評論兒童的人格呢？</p>
<p>兒童，他們何以是偉大的呢？就是因兒童有成人所没有的天眞爛漫吧。兒童要哭就哭，要笑就笑，他絶不關懷自我以外的勢力。兒童的天性，使兒童只求自我之發展和快樂之滿足。兒童是一個無畏忌的快樂的競逐者。兒童可以向成人求安慰，但他手上的東西是不能輕易給别人的，換句話說，兒童完全是爲自己而生存的自然人。兒童完全没有成人的偏見和道德觀念。這就是兒童的偉大。</p>
<p>人或反駁道：果如你所言，兒童只是一個自私自利的生物，有何偉大之可言，又有什麽値得崇拜呢？我的答覆是：是的；兒童正是一個自私自利的生物，但這正是兒童的偉大處。</p>
<p>所謂偉大是什麽呢？偉大就是指的造福人類的東西。兒童之所以偉大，就是因爲兒童是幸福的象徵。</p>
<p>每個人都是爲自己而生存的，每個人都有追求幸福的本能。而且在他追求幸福遇着障碍時，他本可毫無禁忌的與障碍以破壞。兒童之毁壞障碍他的物件，便是此種本能表現。所以有許多人說，假如兒童是有成人之力，他會是人間的巨兇。</p>
<p>但是我們成人都是從兒童之中來的。成人是怎樣失去兒童時代的天性呢？這是不能不歸之於人類的社會制度。人類在長期的生存競爭之中，使他了解到犧牲某些享樂慾求和發展是必要的，於是便自然而然的產生一種離開個人願望的社會制度。社會制度對於個人，恰像園林的主人對於花木，主人總是設法使花木失去自我的願望和發展，使之適合自己的所好。於是社會制度便剥奪人的絶對的存在，使人不復知有自己了。待至後來，社會不僅使其分子犧牲某種本能要求以滿足某種本能要求，且使某部分人犧牲本能要求以滿足另一部分人的無限要求。人類至此，誠如盧梭所云：</p>
<p>除出全體和公共生活之外，遂不知他有自己。』</p>
<p>但是人類的需要本能和求滿足的慾望是不會因抑壓而根絶的。人類恰如向上的𣏌柳，如硬使其曲折，一時固做得到，但其最初的天性是不會改變的，且在人工所不及時，仍舊是要向上發揚的。所以告子說：『以上性爲仁義，猶以𣏌柳爲桮棬。』人類如果不能完全失去求滿足求自由的本能，兒童更保存這些本能之樸素形態。所以兒童成爲幸福的人類的象徵，是天國的使者。兒童的天眞喚醒了奴隸的成人在文明之入口處失去了本能和欲求。所以身感爲奴隸的成人對兒童這種偉大的啓示才發生尊敬。</p>

<h3 id="c296">二本給孩子們讀的童話 <a href="#c296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— 金山</p>
<p>中國的孩子們所讀的童話，大半是什麽王子啦，公子啦，神仙啦，妖怪啦···一類的人物。這些童話，對孩子們的影響，除了使他們幻想他們自己也能像童話中主人翁所處的境遇外，要想找尋出一些以社會的，科學的智識灌輸給孩子們的，却是很困難的。但現在我所看到的幾本童話，雖然不是中國人所著，而是翻譯的，但牠是完成了上述的要求，而是適合於中國的孩子們的。所以我現在來做個簡單的介紹，也算是爲書店老板做個義務廣告。</p>
<p>第一本是美國新文學家哥爾特著的「卓别麟漫游記」。故事是一個小孩子，喬愛，亞丹底二個哥哥有一天到外邊去野餐去了，可是他自己因爲多吃了氷淇淋，病在牀上。他要求舉行一個賽會，但他的媽媽說這個房間太小，不能舉行，要他好好　覺，他就吵起來。可是他總敵不過瞬魔的勢力，慢慢就睡着了。接着小丑卓别麟就出現了。卓别麟非常熟心的爲喬愛去安排一個賽會；他帶喬愛到紐約市長那裏去要求賽會的許可書，但市長說這賽會是太麻煩他，不答應頒發。卓别麟就帶喬愛騎了匹象去找巨人傑姆丨丨他是非常和善的黑人，會吹「薩克索封」（一種美國樂器）。巨人傑姆親切地答應了喬愛的要求，就爬上了象，開始吹他的「薩克索封」。聽到他吹「薩克索封」的人都會跟了他跑，於是慢慢的形成了巨大的賽會。喬愛心裏非常快活。當他們到紐約的時候，市長和他的警察都已拿了棍棒，預備逮捕他們，爲的是擾亂秩序。卓别麟逃了，喬愛也逃了。市長就望喬愛追來，喬愛嚇得要哭了，就此醒來。</p>
<p>你瞧，這不是一本有趣味的童話嗎？</p>

<p>— 森然</p>
<p>我們知道，自文藝復興以來，隨着資本主義的發展，在科學上早已有了許多偉大的發明。别的且不要說，單是與無綫電有直接關係的發明，遠在馬可尼未聞名以前就有了許多，如電磁電報，發電機，電話，有綫電···都是在馬可尼未從事他的研究前就爲人發明了的。所有這些發明，所有自文藝復興以來的科學的文化的遺產，都是馬可尼發明無綫電的基礎。如果没有這個基礎，無論他怎樣聰明，怎樣有毅力，也是不會獲得那樣的成功的。你想，倘然馬可尼生在中世紀物黑暗時代，他能發明無綫電嗎？當然不能！丨丨此其一。</p>
<p>其次，馬可尼所處的時代正是資本主義發展到帝國主義的時代。在這個時代中，資本主義的經濟網已經籠罩了全世界。帝國主義國家正在努力競爭銷售商品的市塲，正在拚命爭奪殖民地，在此情形下，無論商業上，軍事上，政治上，都要求迅速地傳達消息。馬可尼的發明無綫電，便是在這一要求之下實現的。於此，我們可以說，當時英國的海軍演習，南阿戰爭與馬可尼的成功有很大的關係。</p>
<p>同時，馬可尼所生長的地方與他的發明也有不可分離的關係。我們知道，他是生在意大利，活動於英美的國度裏的。這些國家都是先進的國家，其文化程度都在一般之上，所謂近代文明便是以牠們爲代表的。馬可尼在這樣的社會環境中，才有發明無線電的可能。倘如他是生長在中國或印度，那就不會幹出那樣偉大的事業來了。</p>
<p>此外，馬可尼個人的生活環境也很重要。問題非常顯然，如果他不是生在富裕之家，受不到高等的教育，又，如果他得不到里契教授的指導，受不到黑爾支博士的實騐的暗示，遇不到普里士的帮助，那麽，我敢說，不管他是怎樣偉大的天才，他終於是要被埋没的；至於無綫電的發明，那便只有讓與他人了。</p>
<p>自然，馬可尼的聰明，毅力，我們不能否認。但這只是使他能成爲偉大發明家的可能的一個因素，令這種可能成爲現實的却是他所處的時代，社會和其個人的生活環境。</p>
<p>最後，我在評價了馬可尼之後，希望一般崇拜英雄，天才的人們不要迷信英雄，天才，應該科學地去理解他們。這樣，才不致走入神秘的道路！（完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Far Eastern Question and the Naval Question Cannot Be Separated. Japan Worries About Joint Action by Britain and the United States. Washington Emphasizes Political Discussions. The Content of the British Request Letter Is Full of Compromising Tone. Japan Plans to Negotiate Separately with Britain and the United States. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Today's international observers predict that Britain and the United States will jointly resist Japan's agenda for preliminary negotiations on next year's naval disarmament conference. It is said that Japan is now making every effort to talk separately with Britain and the United States, hoping to reach a preliminary understanding on the Far Eastern political issue and the naval issue. However, reliable sources declared today that British and American diplomats believe that political issues and naval ratio issues are inextricably linked. Japan's military actions on the Asian continent make it even more difficult for them to negotiate separately. Britain and the United States believe that the commercial positions of the two countries in the Far East and the entire Pacific market are all related to the survival of this political negotiation. Today, the State Department stated that the United States has notified Britain of its willingness to join the preliminary negotiations of the naval conference. These preliminary negotiations will be held in London, but the date has not yet been determined, and the details have not been finalized. What is known is that this conference will be completely informal. Britain has also invited Japan, Italy, and France to participate. This conference will not only be for representatives of the two countries to meet separately, but also for representatives of three or four countries to meet simultaneously. The first negotiation will determine the procedures for next year's conference, decide the date and location, and then discuss substantive naval issues and other matters. Today, the Japanese side in Washington stated that since London has initiated this matter, they have no reason to discuss naval issues with the State Department. Some diplomats believe that Tokyo and Washington will soon send naval experts to London to assist the ambassadors of the two countries in the preparatory meeting. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to official sources today, Foreign Minister Hirota will instruct Ambassador Matsudaira to Britain at the end of the week to express to the British government that the Japanese government is prepared to discuss the 1935 naval conference. It is expected that the discussions in London, in addition to issues such as the date, location, and procedures of the conference, may also involve important issues such as naval restrictions. Although only Britain has asked the Japanese government for its opinion, judging from the situation, the Japanese side is also willing to respond to the request for similar talks in Washington. The proposal to hold preliminary talks before the naval conference is generally welcomed, but local newspapers are strongly urging attention to the talks between Britain and the United States, so as to avoid Britain and the United States reaching an agreement first and then threatening Japan to accept it, as happened in 1930. This kind of argument seems to reflect the official view. Although Japanese newspapers say that Japan only wants to obtain equality in principle in order to maintain sovereignty and national defense, they strongly advocate abolishing the ratio, saying that this ratio has various inconveniences, and that it is forced to build warships that are not urgently needed, etc. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) All parties are keeping silent about the discussions on the conference to be held next year. Both the Foreign Office and the Admiralty are unwilling to express their opinions. It is generally believed that the extent of the discussions is still only preliminary inquiries. Before the start of the 1930 naval conference, there were preliminary talks, which greatly contributed to the success of the conference. Therefore, it is also planned to hold talks in advance this time. The matters to be discussed will probably be the date and location of the 1935 conference, and the countries to be invited to participate. It is heard that France and Italy have not yet responded to Britain's invitation to participate in the talks, but it is generally expected that both countries will be willing to participate.

<h3 id="e2">Japan Consults on Reply to British Request Letter. Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of the Navy Begin Careful Discussions. <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It was learned today that the Japanese government received a request from British Foreign Secretary Simon to exchange opinions on naval issues in advance in order to facilitate the naval conference. It is heard that the Japanese government plans to talk separately with Britain and the United States. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Foreign Secretary Simon proposed to convene a disarmament preparatory meeting, and the Japanese government expressed its agreement to this. However, Foreign Secretary Simon's proposal did not express anything about the meeting date and agenda, so after clarifying this point, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Navy will consult and issue a formal reply. However, because Foreign Minister Hirota had made a statement in the Diet, he intends to conduct preparatory talks with various countries separately to discuss specific matters. (Japan United News Agency Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Ambassador Matsudaira to Britain received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 25th, British Foreign Secretary Simon met with Ambassador Matsudaira on the 17th and advocated holding a naval disarmament preparatory meeting in order to achieve the three fundamental goals of world peace, eliminating the threat of war, and reducing the burden on the people. Foreign Secretary Simon also briefly described the British naval system and the British views on general naval issues, and requested the Japanese government's response. Ambassador Matsudaira did not make a responsible statement because this issue was very important and reserved his answer. (Japan United News Agency Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding Simon's proposal for a three-nation preparatory meeting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs began careful discussions on the 26th, focusing on the talks of the Japanese ambassador to Britain, with Foreign Minister Hirota inviting Vice Minister Shigemitsu and others. It also plans to consult the intentions of the naval authorities in order to determine its attitude. Foreign Minister Hirota will report to the cabinet, and then issue a formal reply to Britain. It is heard that this meeting is not a meeting where Japan, Britain, and the United States gather together, but will be separate negotiations between Japan and the United States, Japan and Britain, and Britain and the United States. The format is roughly like this, but depending on the situation, it is also possible for the three countries to consult in one room. This meeting will most likely be realized between July and September. (United Press Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Before next year's disarmament conference, the Japanese Navy has already made early preparations. Recently, British Foreign Secretary Simon notified the Japanese ambassador to Britain to hold a preparatory meeting. Therefore, the Navy also plans to have the Ministry of Foreign Affairs convey its intention to participate in the preparation in the near future. At the same time, preparations for the convening of the official disarmament conference have also begun. (Japan United News Agency Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Chargé d'Affaires in Japan, Mr. Dodds, visited Vice Minister Shigemitsu at around 1:00 PM on the 26th to propose a naval preparatory meeting. The content was the same as that proposed by Foreign Secretary Simon to the Japanese ambassador to Britain, and he inquired about the Japanese government's policy. Vice Minister Shigemitsu briefly said that this matter was very good, but the situation was very important, and a reply could only be given after full consultation with the relevant parties. (Japan United News Agency Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) If the preparations for the naval disarmament conference are convened, Britain will be represented by Foreign Secretary Simon, the United States will definitely be represented by its ambassador to Britain, Mr. Bingham, and Mr. Davis, the plenipotentiary representative to the Geneva general disarmament conference. Japan will be represented by Ambassador Matsudaira to Britain as the chief representative, and Mr. Kato, the counselor of the embassy, as its chief administrative officer. If the preparatory meeting progresses very quickly, the staff of the Japanese Embassy in Britain will feel insufficient, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may send additional foreign secretaries to enrich its lineup at that time. Foreign Minister Hirota has already begun to select candidates for this position. As for the army and navy, it goes without saying that specialized talents should be used as consultants to participate. It is generally expected that Naval Attaché in London, Colonel Okanashi, and Lieutenant Colonel Masao Maruyama of the Army will fill these positions. In addition, Major General Akira Morita of the Army and Captain Risaburo Soda of the Navy, the Japanese representatives to the Geneva general disarmament conference, must also be sent to London. The Japanese side's lineup has already been prepared here, and Foreign Minister Hirota will issue instructions soon. (Japan United News Agency Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The next disarmament conference must be held due to the provisions of Article 23 of the London Treaty. However, there are no provisions regarding the location, form, and agenda of the meeting. Therefore, it is necessary for various countries to conduct consultations first. However, which country is willing to serve as the host country? All countries are taking a cautious attitude and exploring the opinions of other countries. At this moment, Britain suddenly proposed to convene a meeting. Britain, as the country that convened the London Conference, is admirable for its enthusiasm for disarmament. Thus, the concrete negotiations for the 1935 naval conference began the first step. In the future, the most noteworthy thing is how the negotiations between Japan, Britain, and the United States will proceed. (Japan United News Agency Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from London, it is reported that the preparatory negotiations for the 1935 naval conference will be held separately in Tokyo and London. In these negotiations, Japan has made concessions on the demand for equality in naval ratios. The Japanese Navy recently issued a statement saying that the Japanese Navy still demands the establishment of equality in armament rights. Japan's attitude is to enable all countries in the world to achieve disarmament and have an equal sense of security for their respective national defenses. This ambition has not changed in any way.

<h3 id="e3">Contents of the British Request Letter. Discussion of Substantive Naval Issues. Starting Point Is Britain, the United States, and Japan. <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the preparation for the next naval conference, the proposal to convene a preparatory meeting with major naval powers was officially notified by Foreign Secretary Simon when he met with the Japanese ambassador to Britain on the 17th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has kept the contents of Simon's proposal strictly confidential. It is now learned that the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The preparatory meeting hopes to discuss various substantive issues related to the navy.</p>
<p>(2) The preparatory meeting is limited to naval issues only.</p>
<p>(3) The preparatory meeting should be initiated by the diplomatic missions in London and conduct individual negotiations with various countries in order to implement it.</p>
<p>(4) The preparatory meeting should start with at least three countries, and the initial meeting should be held by Britain, the United States, and Japan. There is no need for France and Italy to join at this time.</p>
<p>Judging from the above contents, the preparatory negotiations are not discussing issues such as the opening date and location of the next naval conference, but are directly discussing the substance of naval disarmament issues. This preparatory meeting has increased its importance. On the British side, the restriction is limited to the discussion of naval issues only. There is a rumor that the so-called Pacific issue and Far Eastern issue do not seem to be included. As for whether the three countries will meet together to start discussions, it is doubtful, but on this point, the Japanese government has also hoped to conduct individual negotiations with various countries and focus on the preparatory negotiations between Japan, Britain, and the United States. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will carefully discuss this noteworthy proposal with the Ministry of the Navy before giving a reply. However, since the above points are the contents of the proposal and do not violate the Japanese government's policy, it should be gladly participated in. Therefore, the naval conference may not wait until next year and will in fact open soon. (Japan United News Agency Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">US Congressman Criticizes Japanese Aggression. Japan's Ambition to Demand Naval Equality. The United States Should Guard Against It Wielding Its Barbaric Tactics Again. <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Congressman Britten told an Associated Press interviewer today that if Japan is allowed to increase its naval ratio, then Manchuria, Hawaii, and the Philippines will undoubtedly be dominated by the barbaric Japanese warlords. Congressman Britten is an important figure in the House Naval Affairs Committee and has long been known for his familiarity with international naval issues. He said that if Japan insists on abandoning the existing naval ratio, the United States should immediately build defensive naval and air bases on the Pacific islands. When the naval treaty is re-discussed next year, Japan has no reason to try to expand the ratio. Japan's occupation of tens of millions of square miles of Manchurian land is not enough to make it necessary. The Chinese navy is even more obviously not a threat. Therefore, the only conclusion is that Japan is plotting to control the Pacific with a navy that dominates the world. If so, other countries in the Pacific must guard against Japan, not allowing it to repeat its old tricks of occupying Manchuria. If Japan insists on its current naval policy, then Manchuria can easily become the meat on the chopping block of Japan's violent militarism. Therefore, we must establish defenses on that island. We should expand air bases in key locations in the Philippines, and Hawaii's defenses should also be strengthened, so as to become the second Gibraltar. We should also demand that Japan's other islands be transferred to the management of the United States or other countries. Regarding the possibility of concluding a new naval treaty, Britten said that Japan's treaties with various countries in the past five years have been no different from waste paper. Japan's massacre of Chinese people and destruction of Chinese property is a bad example of unprovoked aggression. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e5">The Abolition of Excessive and Miscellaneous Taxes Should Not Be Delayed Any Longer <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Today, there are many who suffer from the ills of excessive and miscellaneous taxes. It is said that since the tide of the global economic panic invaded, our country's economic situation has become increasingly difficult. Even the relatively developed yarn industry has failed to compete with foreign imports in the market, not to mention other industries. Not only do we encounter obstacles everywhere when exporting overseas, but we are also hindered by excessive and miscellaneous taxes even when trying to survive in the domestic market. This is the first reason why the abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>Our country is founded on agriculture, but recently, due to low grain prices, farmers are unable to make ends meet even if they sell all their harvests. They are leaving the countryside en masse, leading to a panic about land abandonment. Although this dangerous situation can be partially explained by natural disasters and other political reasons, the excessive and miscellaneous taxes should be the primary factor constituting the estrangement between the government and the people and the decline of the rural areas. If these excessive and miscellaneous taxes are not fundamentally eliminated, there is no hope for the revival of the rural economy, and even maintaining a temporary state of well-being is difficult. This is the second reason why the abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>Even from the perspective of government revenue and expenditure, the main sources of revenue for the central government are customs duties and salt taxes, which are initially unrelated to excessive and miscellaneous taxes. However, the consolidated tax and stamp duty revenue are inevitably indirectly affected by the heavy burden of excessive and miscellaneous taxes. As for local governments, some believe that relying on excessive and miscellaneous taxes can make up for the shortfall in regular taxes. In fact, in general, most of the so-called excessive and miscellaneous taxes are pocketed by tax officials privately, while the actual revenue received by local governments is in the minority. Thus, extra-legal levies only invite the resentment of the people and do not provide much assistance to the government. This is the third reason why the abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>The harm of excessive and miscellaneous taxes is so great. Fortunately, this fiscal conference explained the nature of excessive and miscellaneous taxes and has decided on six categories and plans to abolish them in stages from July 1st of this year to the end of December. However, there is still something we cannot help but say. At the same time, the conference also decided that the compensatory measures after the abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes can be discussed separately, and that provinces and cities that have special circumstances that prevent them from completely abolishing them within the time limit can also submit special cases to the ministry. In view of the common problem of past conferences in our country, which is that resolutions are not implemented and eventually become pending cases, the resolution of the above-mentioned fiscal conference has two provisos, one related to compensatory methods and the other related to the special circumstances of each province and city. We are afraid that the resulting malpractices will inevitably repeat the mistakes of past proposals. The provinces and cities can use the excuse that the preparation of compensatory measures is insufficient to postpone the implementation of the abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes, and can also use the special circumstances of the local area to shirk responsibility. As a result, the deadline at the end of this year may be extended indefinitely. It must be known that our country has a vast territory and transportation is difficult. Any place or province or city has its special circumstances. Such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Xikang, Qinghai and other remote provinces, its special points are too numerous to mention. The burden of excessive and miscellaneous taxes is also rare in the world. If the government does not vigorously implement a solid rectification policy, there will inevitably be many who outwardly comply but inwardly disobey. Our people have no way out.</p>
<p>At present, the financial situation of various provinces and cities is indeed in a state of exhaustion and difficult to sustain. However, this phenomenon is a reflection of the national economy being on the verge of bankruptcy. If we do not engage in fundamental cultivation to give the people a chance to breathe and regenerate, we are afraid that once the national economy collapses, local revenue will also perish with it. Confucius said, "The people's burden has already been deep, and even if you want to levy excessive taxes again, they cannot bear it. The foundation of the country lies in the people. How can you bear to make endless increases?" It can be seen that the authorities are well aware of the people's suffering. No matter what special circumstances there are in the local area, they must overcome all difficulties to relieve the people from their suffering.</p>
<p>We believe that if we want to abolish excessive and miscellaneous taxes, we should actively strive to eliminate the source of malpractices and should not worry about passively compensating for the shortfall. The reason why excessive and miscellaneous taxes were difficult to abolish in the past was mostly because there were too many redundant soldiers in various places, and the government's funding was insufficient. The discipline of the army was lax, which led to disturbing the people. Therefore, the fundamental solution is that first, the central government should strictly order all provinces and regions not to organize additional troops. Incumbent military officers who also serve as provincial chairmen must not expand their troops privately. Secondly, a proper disarmament plan should be further developed. Those who have been disarmed should be discharged separately, and those who have not been disarmed should be given adequate pay. In this way, the central government's orders can be implemented, and excessive and miscellaneous taxes will eventually be abolished. If we do not do this, but only talk about compensation, we are still afraid that it will not help in reality.</p>

<p>(Tianjin) At 8:00 PM on the 25th, a detachment of Japanese infantry stationed in Luan County practiced resistance warfare. At one point, there was a great burst of gunfire. The defense corps stationed in the county, unaware of the truth, sent militiamen to patrol. Three of them mistakenly entered the Japanese army's self-established 警戒line and were arrested, accused of anti-Japanese behavior. They were arbitrarily tortured in the Japanese barracks, and a protest was filed with Tao Shangming, the administrative commissioner of Luan Yu. Fearing that the Japanese army would take action, the defense corps has withdrawn from the city. (Special Telegram, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Yesterday's Financial Conference Held Large Meetings Both Morning and Afternoon: Opinions on the Business Tax Proposal Sent to the Executive Yuan for Reference; Methods for Abolishing Excessive and Miscellaneous Taxes Passed; Two Savings Associations Prevented from Accepting Members; Opium Taxes and Levies Cancelled with a Deadline for Eliminating Addiction; Fourth General Meeting <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The fourth general meeting of the Financial Conference was held at 10:30 AM on the 26th, with 134 members present and 7 absent with leave. Kong Xiangxi chaired the meeting and reported the receipt of four official documents: a table of comparative figures for the additional levies on land taxes in various counties submitted by the Shanxi Provincial Department of Finance, and a report on reducing additional land taxes submitted by the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Finance. Discussion began immediately, with Zhang Shouyong, Director of the Second Group, reporting on the review process for the various business tax proposals. The secretary then read out the review opinions and results. The entire matter was of great importance. Wang Chengying and Yang Mianzhong advocated expanding the business tax rate, opposing the review opinions, arguing that Zhejiang Province was currently undergoing construction, and if excessive and miscellaneous taxes were abolished, business tax must be used to offset the loss. Ma Yinchu said that Zhejiang's construction required other methods of compensation, and strongly denounced the harms of the prize-linked savings schemes of the Banque Franco-Chinoise and the International Savings Society, stating that financial authorities should not allow them to operate or should find ways to take them back. The International Savings Society had already collected 60 million yuan, and if it continued, it would greatly affect the national economy. Wang Hantao advocated that the business tax rate should be flexible to suit local conditions, allowing for expansion and contraction, and protecting domestic goods while preventing the intrusion of foreign goods. He suggested forming another committee to review the case in detail. Guan Jiyu said that protecting domestic goods should be done through other means and stated that business taxes in various countries were based on the amount of sales. This type of transaction tax was equivalent to China's likin, an important tax collection, but was extremely harmful to the people and violated the fundamental concept of business tax. He believed that the collection of business tax should classify industries and grade taxes, keeping it simple. He said that the goal of collecting the tax was not to increase the tax rate but to ensure universal collection in order to achieve good results. Chen Changheng said that the tax rate should not be increased and suggested adding the following phrase to the review results: "It is proposed that the Ministry of Finance submit all original proposals and review opinions to the Executive Yuan for referral to the Legislative Yuan as a reference when amending the Business Tax Law." Wei Tingsheng argued that, in the midst of economic depression, he did not support raising the tax rate, and supported passing the original review proposal. Zhang Kailian said that the business tax should be increased to 20 per mille, and Wu Jiantao advocated that all proposals be handed over to the Ministry of Finance for detailed consideration based on local realities. The Chairman said that the stipulation of the business tax rate should be flexible. If various provinces have opinions, the Ministry can allow them to handle it within a possible range. Reducing excessive and miscellaneous taxes naturally required seeking methods of compensation. Currently, agricultural products were not worth much, and farmers were unable to bear the burden. Everyone was striving to revive the countryside and should not increase taxes. The same was true for commerce. As long as merchants could afford it, more taxes could be collected. However, local conditions varied, and local financial authorities should consult with the Ministry of Finance based on actual circumstances. Furthermore, China should not spend according to income but should use income to determine expenditure as a principle, saving where possible. Subsequently, Xu Lufu, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, responded to Ma Leichu's points, stating that the Ministry of Finance would never allow prize-linked savings to profit from taxation. The Banque Franco-Chinoise and the International Savings Society were permitted during the Beijing era and could now be resolved through legislative and administrative means. At this point in the discussion, members felt that the matter of business tax could not be resolved in a short time and expressed their agreement with Chen Changheng's amendment. Representatives from Zhejiang Province were dissatisfied with the review opinions and declared their withdrawal of the original proposal. The Chairman said that this was not possible. As a result, the proposal was amended and passed based on Chen Changheng's suggestion. The original text was revised to read, "All original proposals and review opinions shall be submitted to the Executive Yuan for referral to the Legislative Yuan as a reference when amending the Business Tax Law. If there are any inconsistencies with the articles of the Business Tax Law, amendments or supplements should be requested from the Ministry of Finance for submission to the Executive Yuan for referral to the Legislative Yuan for amendment and promulgation in accordance with the law." Subsequently, the proposal by the Ministry of Finance to reorganize the business tax of various provinces and cities to conform to the original intention of benefiting commerce and increasing revenue was discussed, as were the proposals regarding the stamp tax on title deeds in the Shanghai Special District and the stamp tax on bills of lading for foreign shipping companies. All three proposals were passed according to the review results. After the discussion of the Second Group's review reports, Ma Yinchu reported on the review process for the various proposals of the Third Group. The resolution regarding item A of the fourth part of the Minister's proposal for reorganizing local finances, such as the division of revenue and expenditure between provinces and counties/cities, was passed according to the review opinions and the principles of the First Proposal of the Group. The resolutions regarding items 1 and 2 of the proposal by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to determine local budget methods, as well as the various proposals from the Hubei, Anhui, and Shandong Provincial Departments of Finance, were passed according to the review results. Central and local budgets at all levels should be prepared and submitted within the statutory time limit and strictly implemented. The resolution regarding the internal proposal to determine the procedure for reviewing local administrative expenses was passed after amendment according to the review results. Finally, the various proposals reviewed by the Fourth Group were discussed. Zhang Kailian listed various facts from Hunan Province to oppose the review results regarding the proposal by the Hunan Provincial Government requesting the Central Government to issue a clear order that all national tax agencies should continue to entrust the provincial and local governments with close supervision for rectification. Wei Tingsheng said that the Central Government would set up branch offices of accounting and other auditing agencies in various places, making local supervision unnecessary. As a result, according to the review opinions, national tax agencies had no subordinate relationship with provincial and local governments, and the proposal was likely to create confusion with the administrative system and was difficult to establish. The resolutions regarding the proposal to request the Central Government to allocate funds to develop Guizhou's coal and iron mineral resources, the proposal that central and local finances should be mutually supportive to achieve balanced development, the proposal that provincial universities should be converted to national universities or subsidized by the Central Government for improvement, the request that the government order local officials in various provinces to assist in handling the salt affairs reward and punishment regulations, and the request to reduce the expenses of county autonomy to alleviate the people's burden were all passed according to the review results. Finally, Ma Yinchu and nine other members jointly proposed a temporary motion regarding the crackdown on prize-linked savings, requesting that the Banque Franco-Chinoise and the International Savings Society be prevented from absorbing new members, and requesting that the Ministry of Finance send personnel to monitor the funds of these associations. After Kong referred it to members for review, it was submitted to the general meeting for discussion and adjourned at 12:30 PM. The fifth general meeting continued at 2:00 PM to discuss unfinished proposals. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>D. Review opinions on the crackdown on private minting of silver and copper coins and private issuance of banknotes to purify the currency administration: China's currency system urgently needs unified reorganization. The Ministry of Finance has already stipulated various reorganization plans. The proposition in this case is based on the regulations of the Ministry of Finance and is extremely practical and feasible. It should be considered established. It is proposed that the Ministry order the provinces, based on the original laws and regulations, to effectively crack down. All mints and bureaus in various provinces should be ordered to stop minting immediately. If there are difficulties in remote provinces, they should report the facts truthfully, and the Ministry will reorganize them separately. Passed according to the review opinions.</p>
<p>E. Proposal for rural financial relief: Review opinions: The fundamental way to revive the countryside is to relieve finance. The proposition in this case is extremely important, and the provisions are comprehensive. It should be considered established.

Passed according to the review opinions.</p>
<p>F. Please consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to quickly find ways to recover the privilege of foreign banks to issue banknotes in order to establish the foundation for a unified currency administration. Review opinions: Currently, there are many obstacles to China's financial administration, which is due to foreign banks not complying with Chinese laws and issuing banknotes. This is just one aspect. Please have the Ministry of Finance consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and negotiate with various countries to order all foreign banks in China to comply with Chinese laws in order to uphold sovereignty and benefit finance. Passed according to the review opinions.</p>
<p>G. (1) The Ningxia Provincial Department of Finance proposed that the abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes and similar likin revenue should be compensated by the Central Government. (2) The Shandong Provincial Department of Finance proposed to strictly prohibit counties from collecting extra levies after the budget is announced to alleviate the people's burden. Review results: The methods for abolishing excessive and miscellaneous taxes and the preparation methods after the abolition have been approved in another case. The proposal by the Ningxia Provincial Department of Finance to abolish excessive and miscellaneous taxes and be compensated by the Central Government is included in the previous case. The pain suffered by the people from extra levies is even greater than that from excessive and miscellaneous taxes. The proposal by the Shandong Provincial Department of Finance to strictly prohibit counties from collecting extra levies after the budget is announced is in line with financial principles and should be strictly prohibited. Please have the Ministry of Finance submit it to the Executive Yuan and order the provinces to strictly prohibit counties from collecting extra levies. Once verified, they should be severely punished to alleviate the people's difficulties. Resolution: Passed according to the review opinions.</p>
<p>H. A. (1) Chen Changheng et al. proposed that after reducing local land tax surcharges and abolishing excessive and miscellaneous taxes, in order to maintain the balance of local budget revenue and expenditure, the Central Government should coordinate and subsidize local finances. (2) The Zhejiang Provincial Government's Department of Finance proposed to re-divide the standards for national and local income. Review opinions: The first point and the sixth point of the first case have been seen in the third review report of this group, and the seventh point has been seen in the second report of this group, all of which have been passed by the general meeting. The second, third, and fifth points are appropriate for adjusting the central and local finances. The percentage of inheritance tax and income tax allocated should be determined by the Central Government. The fourth point should be strictly implemented to eliminate malpractices. The eighth point is that the expenses of national universities in various provinces and cities are borne by the Central Government, and the part paid by the provinces and cities is to assist the Central Government. The second article on re-dividing national and local revenue and expenditure has been specifically resolved by this conference. Change the fourth point to eliminate all local opium taxes and levies, and completely prohibit the harm of opium within a limited time. The rest passed according to the review results.</p>
<p>(I) A. (1) The Ministry of the Interior proposed to determine the procedure for reviewing local administrative expenses. Resolution: Passed according to the review opinions.</p>
<p>(J) (1) Zhang Miao proposed to improve local finances. (2) Tang Qiyu proposed to divide the scope of provincial and county taxes. Review results: Of the eight items proposed by Zhang Miao, the first item, dividing provincial and county income, and the second item, strictly implementing unified collection and expenditure, are in line with financial principles. The Ministry of Finance is requested to order the provincial financial departments to comply with them. The third item, abolishing excessive and miscellaneous taxes, has been reviewed in another report. The fourth item, the central government ceding taxes to local areas, should be quickly discussed and decided by the Ministry of Finance. The intentions of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth items are in line with the Executive Yuan's proposal to implement the abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes. The Ministry of Finance is requested to handle them in a coordinated manner. Tang Qiyu's proposal to divide the scope of provincial and county taxes is consistent with the current common practices in various provinces. The Ministry of Finance is requested to order the provinces to refer to it. Provinces and counties that have already divided taxes should strictly abide by the established rules. Provinces and counties that have not yet divided them should quickly divide them to specialize responsibilities. Resolution: Passed after amendment according to the review opinions. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Item C of the cases passed at the Financial Conference on the 26th is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the various business tax proposals, after Director Zhang Shouyong reported, Wang Zhengying believed that the report was unfair in terms of collection methods and graded tax rates. The biggest problem was that banks were not taxed, while pawnshops were taxed. Xu Kan replied that banks had other income taxes and were not exempt. The case was discussed for a long time. As a result, Chen Changheng proposed that the Ministry of Finance submit the original proposals and review opinions of the various provinces to the Executive Yuan and specially request the Legislative Yuan to use them as a reference for amending the Business Tax Law, which was passed immediately. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Member Wang Hantao of the Financial Conference proposed to restore the old system of salt administration agencies and abolish the administrative methods concurrently held by audit personnel in order to clarify the system. Review results: Wei Tingsheng believed that it would increase administrative expenses and was not in line with the purpose of convening the Financial Conference, so it was rejected immediately. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) All the border provinces sent representatives to this National Financial Conference. However, the Guangxi Provincial Government previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating that the originally appointed representative was currently unable to attend due to unforeseen circumstances. Subsequently, Kong Xiangxi, Chairman of the Conference, telegraphed Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the province, asking him to appoint another representative to report to the secretariat of the Conference in Beijing and attend the fourth general meeting on the morning of the 26th.

<h3 id="e12">Opium Prohibited within a Limited Time <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the afternoon of the 26th, the Financial Conference discussed the proposal by Chen Changheng et al. to reduce local land tax surcharges and abolish excessive and miscellaneous taxes in order to maintain the balance of local budget revenue and expenditure, the Central Government should coordinate and subsidize local finances. The original proposal outlined four points, stating that the period of political tutelage was about to end, but most of the work of the military government period had not yet been completed. The increasing harm of opium may be due to the fact that the central and local governments separately collect evil taxes. If this Financial Conference wants to save the country and the people, as the Chairman said, to be a conference to save the country from ruin, it should make the greatest determination and perseverance to unanimously and solemnly resolve to abolish all opium evil taxes levied by the central and local governments, which are harmful to the people, weaken the country, and undermine the race, and suggest that the Central Government issue a clear order to completely prohibit the harm of opium throughout the country within three years. The review committee also believes that the methods for eliminating malpractices should be strictly implemented. During the discussion, members Ma Yinchu, Chen Changheng, Wei Tingsheng, Li Quanshi, etc. all spoke, all of whom believed that the harm of opium weakens the country and destroys the people, hoping that the Central Government and Minister Kong can change the method and thoroughly eliminate it, regardless of the facts and rumors, so as to conform to the purpose of this conference to save the country from ruin. As a result, the fourth point was amended to: If there are any local opium taxes and levies, they should be abolished, and the harm of opium should be completely prohibited within three years. The vote was passed. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e13">Methods for Cracking Down on Savings Associations <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the general meeting of the Financial Conference on the afternoon of the 26th, Ma Yinchu, Jia Shiyi, Wei Tingsheng, Tang Qiyu, Wang Hantao, Zhang Wei, Deng Junfang, and nine other people temporarily proposed two methods for cracking down on the Banque Franco-Chinoise and the International Savings Society: (1) Stop collecting new membership fees; (2) The Ministry of Finance sends personnel to monitor the association's funds. The general meeting decided to hand it over to the Ministry of Finance for handling. In addition, the Xiamen Maritime Association telegraphed to request the abolition of navigation taxes. The general meeting decided that ship tax was one of the onerous taxes, and the general meeting decided to send a telegram to stop collecting it. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu and others proposed to the Financial Conference to strictly prohibit the Banque Franco-Chinoise and the International Savings Society's prize-linked savings schemes. Review opinions: Please submit it to the Ministry of Finance for handling. The general meeting passed the vote this afternoon. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Minister Kong gave each member of the Financial Conference a folding fan on the 26th, with the inscription: "Finance is the lifeline of the country. Our country is now suffering from anemia and toxic blood. I hope that the national doctors who came to this meeting to work on replenishing blood and purifying blood will implement the solutions opened up one by one, so that the country can be saved," etc. Kong also invited all members to visit Wuzhou Park at 5:00 PM for a picnic.

<h3 id="e15">The PingSui Railway Starts Reorganizing Debts: The East Asia Debt is Also a Part, Completely Unrelated to the Nishihara Loans <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Millard's Review said that the PingSui Railway's reorganization of the Japanese East Asia Development Company loan was a prelude to the Chinese government's reorganization of the Nishihara loans. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Railways, the Japanese newspaper on May 6 reported that an agreement on reorganizing the PingSui Railway's 5.2 million yen loan with the Japanese East Asia Development Company was signed on April 25, which was true. It was negotiated by the PingSui Railway Bureau and East Asia and approved by the Ministry. The Ministry has been actively reorganizing road debts in the past two years, first to improve creditworthiness and second to determine the budget of each road. Since the implementation, the creditworthiness of the railway has improved greatly, which is well known at home and abroad. The PingSui has gradually gained a firm grasp of operations since last year. In order to reduce the burden and sympathize with creditors, methods for reorganizing debts were established early on, and reorganization methods have been signed with forty or fifty creditors. East Asia is one of the creditors and requested reorganization based on the case. The agreement with the Railway Bureau is within the scope of the predetermined plan. As for the terms of the agreement, both the Railway Bureau and the creditor benefit. The PingSui's reorganization of East Asia's debt is part of the PingSui's debt reorganization plan and part of the Ministry of Railways' debt reorganization policy. It is purely a railway affair and is completely unrelated to the Nishihara loans. The Millard's Review mistakenly believed that Chen Youren listed the PingSui East Asia loan as part of the Nishihara loans in his article published in 1918 and published comments based on this misattributed record, which is contrary to the facts. The Nishihara loans did not include the PingSui East Asia loan. There are seven loans and advances in the Nishihara loans: (1) Communications Bank loan, (2) Wireless loan, (3) Jihui Railway advance, (4) Jihei Forest Mine loan, (5) Manchurian and Mongolian Four Roads advance, (6) Gaoxu Jisun advance, (7) War participation loan, all of which have their own history. I don't know why Chen Youren mistakenly included the PingSui Road East Asia loan in it, and the Millard's Review repeated the mistake. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e16">Official Statement by Administrative Authorities Regarding Transportation and Postal Issues - Japanese Side Confirms Proposal - Our Government Has Not Yet Discussed This <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding various issues such as transportation and postal services, rumors have been rampant recently, and newspapers in Shanghai and Beijing have published conflicting reports, leading to differing claims. This makes it difficult for the public to know the truth. A reporter from the Central News Agency, recognizing the importance of this matter, visited the administrative authorities at their official residence on the morning of the 26th to inquire about the actual situation. According to the discussion, regarding the postal issue, the League of Nations Advisory Committee recently resolved on a method for the passage of mail from various countries through Manchuria. This matter is a technical solution for maintaining postal services between administrative organs and is by no means a relationship between governments. However, our country has not yet discussed this matter with Japan, and the reports in various newspapers are not factual. As for the transportation issue, the Japanese side recently proposed research to our responsible officials, but this was not a formal discussion, and it is merely the Japanese side's unilateral opinion. Our government has not yet discussed this matter, nor has it made any specific decisions. The various rumors circulating are all inaccurate. Even if future research between the two sides yields results, it must first be submitted to the central government for comprehensive consideration before a decision can be made. In short, the central government's approach to this matter is based on the principle of not violating the non-recognition of the puppet organization. Otherwise, there is absolutely no room for consideration. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the postal issue in the Northeast, relevant parties are proceeding in accordance with the League of Nations Sino-Japanese Advisory Committee's resolution: "The exchange of mail between League of Nations member states and the Northeast is considered a technical issue, not a relationship between countries, and especially not recognition of the puppet organization." This is to restore normal postal relations within an appropriate timeframe, without any connection to the term "puppet organization." The Ministry of Communications is carefully studying this issue based on the League of Nations resolution. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Harbin) At 4 PM on the 25th, 200 volunteer soldiers under the command of the Western Province suddenly attacked the area between Yimianpo and Jiujiangbao. Although the Jilin army fought back, they were outnumbered and lost three soldiers. Fifteen soldiers were kidnapped by the volunteer army. (Telecommunications dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Since the volunteer army in Antu County killed the puppet county chief, Japanese advisor, and Japanese police instructor a few days ago, many puppet soldiers and police have defected and joined forces with the volunteer army. The Japanese army immediately dispatched a large force to garrison Antu County. The volunteer army has established its base in the Dajianggang and Dashashe areas north of Antu County. On the 24th, they destroyed the military telephone line in Dashashe and are poised to attack the county seat. The Japanese army in the city is trembling with fear, and the Kwantung Army has ordered other Japanese troops stationed in Dunhua to reinforce. (Hualian dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the 18th of this month, a Japanese army detachment stationed in Hengdaohezi, led by Second Lieutenant Fukunaga, left the city to attack the volunteer army, but their whereabouts are unknown. On the afternoon of the 23rd, the Japanese army dispatched another team to search. They discovered that Fukunaga's team had been engaged in fierce battles with the volunteer army for several days northwest of the city. Second Lieutenant Fukunaga and Private First Class Kami-Kobe had been killed in action. Private First Class Ueda was seriously wounded, and the remaining troops were lost and unable to return.

<p>(Tokyo) According to the Army Ministry, yesterday at 2 PM, near the border between northern Sakhalin and Russian Sakhalin, two Japanese, Takeda and Konmatsu, spotted a strange aircraft. The aircraft was a biplane and emitted black smoke during flight. The two Japanese believed it was a Soviet Russian plane and reported it to the Japanese police, who then reported it to the Sakhalin Agency. The Army Ministry is investigating the truth about the aircraft. (Hualian dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Since Count Kiyoura Keigo, who was considered a strong candidate to succeed the cabinet, returned to Tokyo from Kyoto, the central political situation has suddenly become active. The first choice for the next cabinet is said to be Governor-General Ugaki, followed by Count Kiyoura. It is rumored that the military's opposition to Ugaki has not subsided, so the Kiyoura theory is now quite powerful. Within the House of Peers, a clandestine movement to support Count Kiyoura, led by Otsuka Korei and Nagaoka Ryuichiro, is underway. Generally, it is believed that after Saito, it will be difficult to form a cabinet based on political parties and impossible to return to constitutional normality. Therefore, it is acknowledged that it is appropriate for the senior statesman Count Kiyoura to form a successor cabinet. Although Count Kiyoura is 85 years old, he is in excellent spirits, and his healthy condition is sufficient to undertake the arduous task of prime minister. (Telecommunications dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Rumors are circulating that after the Saito cabinet resigns en masse, Governor-General Ugaki of Korea will continue to form a second emergency cabinet. The Colonial Affairs Ministry has received a telegram stating that Governor-General Ugaki is scheduled to depart Seoul for Tokyo on the 28th. He will inspect the southern Korean region en route, so he will arrive in Tokyo at 4:55 PM on the 31st. Although a portion of the military opposes Governor-General Ugaki's assumption of the next cabinet, it is quite hopeful. Therefore, all parties are paying special attention to Governor-General Ugaki's trip to Tokyo. (Telecommunications dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e20">Foreign Minister Barthou Announces France Is Not Isolated - Contacting Allied Nations - The Door to Disarmament Is Not Yet Closed - But French Policy Remains Unchanged <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Chamber of Deputies held a meeting to discuss foreign policy. Many figures from the diplomatic community and foreign journalists were present to observe. Foreign Minister Barthou attended and delivered a declaration, which was warmly welcomed by the entire assembly. Barthou first stated that Austria is a pillar of peace in Central Europe, and France's policy has always been to maintain its independence. As for Poland, it is a friend and ally of France. His recent trip to Warsaw has brought Soviet Russia and Poland closer together. Barthou also stated that the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations is a major event. Barthou, as a person who cherishes peace, believes that the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations will greatly benefit peace. Barthou recounted his meeting with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov in Geneva, saying that he had discussed the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations with Litvinov. However, regarding the Soviet Union's request to become a permanent member of the League of Nations Executive Council, it seems too early to say what attitude France will take. Barthou then recounted his visits to Czechoslovakia and Poland, saying that the warm hospitality of the people of both countries was unforgettable. His trip to Warsaw consolidated the alliance treaty between France and Poland in 1921. He will soon travel to Romania and Yugoslavia, and even if there are disagreements between them, they can be eliminated through this. He will meet with Turkish Foreign Minister Rushdi this Saturday. This shows that France's policy is to connect with the emotions of all parties.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of disarmament, Barthou stated that the policies pursued by previous cabinets are still being followed, namely disarmament under conditions of security and seeking equality in armaments. However, France cannot ignore military groups outside of Germany's formal army, and as long as Germany's rearmament actions do not stop for a day, France cannot recognize disarmament for a day. France's reply to the United Kingdom on April 17th stated that France has always believed that the Disarmament Conference should take disarmament as its final result. As for rearmament that is contrary to peace treaties, it should not be recognized by the Disarmament Conference. But in any case, the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference have not closed their doors. The French government has always supported peace and has always been loyal to the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Regarding the Saarland vote next year, Barthou said that the freedom of voters must be absolutely respected. During the discussion in Geneva, any measures that would endanger Saarland residents to retaliation after voting were resolutely rejected. France has not abandoned any of the rights it has obtained from treaties regarding the Saarland issue, which is deeply gratifying. Barthou said that in Geneva, he declared to Aloisi, the chairman of the special committee on the Saarland issue, that effective safeguards must be taken for the Saarland residents' vote. Germany's empty guarantees of freedom of voting, even if they are formal declarations, are insufficient. At that time, Aloisi and the special committee drafted a method that they considered acceptable, namely, "France and Germany are willing to recognize all measures that the League of Nations can take to protect Saarland residents." However, the German government was unwilling to accept this method, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Barthou concluded by saying that none of the French people enjoy fighting. The French are doing everything they can to avoid war, and he believes that war can be avoided. The French will always be consistent towards friends and allies. It is not impossible for France and Italy to establish a friendly agreement, and its relationship with the United Kingdom has not cooled down. At this time, someone raised questions about France's international relations. Barthou replied that France is not in an isolated position. At this point, almost all the members of the audience applauded, including the Socialist Party. The Chamber of Deputies then decided to postpone the questioning on foreign policy until the Foreign Minister returned from Geneva, as he would have to go there soon. The meeting then adjourned.

<p>(Paris) Turkish Foreign Minister Rushdi visited Foreign Minister Barthou this morning, and the meeting lasted for an hour. The Balkan Pact was mentioned during the conversation. In addition, the possibility of the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations was also mentioned. It is generally known that Turkey and the Soviet Union have always had very close relations. Therefore, the conversation between the foreign ministers of France and Turkey cannot be taken lightly. In general, the issue of the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations will be the main issue in the upcoming international talks in Geneva and consultations between various governments in the coming weeks, as the various difficulties of the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations have not yet been resolved.

<p>(Geneva) Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, arrived here this morning. While talking to people in the Disarmament Conference lounge today, Henderson declared that he did not intend to put forward any new proposals at this session of the conference. In his opinion, only the countries attending the Disarmament Conference, especially those most closely related to the disarmament issue, could clearly state their intentions and, when necessary, put forward new proposals. It was rumored that Henderson favored returning the entire dossier on the disarmament issue to the League of Nations Executive Council as an ending. Henderson denied this rumor again today. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Although England and France are only separated by a narrow strip of water, their concepts of security are completely different. Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, spoke to a special reporter from the News Chronicle after returning to England from Paris about two conflicting views on the Disarmament Conference. First, in Henderson's view, the best way to get Germany to return to Geneva is for the entire General Committee of the Disarmament Conference to reiterate the declaration of December 11, 1932, in which the five major powers allowed Germany to obtain equal rights to armaments within the scope of security. Second, Henderson is most opposed to transferring the negotiations on the disarmament issue to the League of Nations Executive Council. He said, "I don't see any benefit to this method. It is undoubtedly true that Germany cannot attend the League of Nations Executive Council. As far as the interests of small countries are concerned, they have more representatives on the main disarmament committee than on the League of Nations Executive Council. As for the major powers, their opinions are divided, and as a result, all progress has been inhibited so far. It is difficult to hope that they will be able to cooperate more harmoniously and move forward more bravely on the League of Nations Executive Council than in normal disarmament negotiations. Furthermore, in the event of failure, public opinion will blame the League of Nations itself, rather than the politicians representing the country." The principle that the Disarmament Conference should be based on the five-power declaration of December 11, 1932, is to give Germany and other countries whose armaments have been reduced by treaty, in principle, the right to armament equality within a security system suitable for all countries. Germany then returned to the Disarmament Conference. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference will meet in Geneva on the 29th of this month. The United States will still send Davis to attend as an observer.

Henderson and Davis traveled to Geneva together by train this evening. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>Yeftich, Foreign Minister of the Yugoslavian capital, left today for Geneva to attend the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference. It is likely that Yeftich will then go directly to Paris and officially visit the French government on the 10th and 11th of June. Yeftich will also study the situation created by the recent coup in Bulgaria together with Maximoss, Tidulesco, and Rushdi, the foreign ministers of Greece, Romania, and Turkey, the other signatory countries of the Balkan Entente, and will try to persuade Bulgaria to join the Balkan Entente. In addition, after Yeftich arrives in Geneva, he will meet with Soviet Foreign Commissioner Litvinov. At that time, he will also be able to obtain the consent of Tidulesco and Yenneurs to continue negotiations with Litvinov on the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Little Entente and the Soviet Union. These negotiations were started by Litvinov and Tidulesco in France. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>Cooperating Closely with Soviet Russia to Maintain Peace - But Too Early to Grant League of Nations Permanent Council Seat</p>

<p>(Paris) During the Chamber of Deputies discussion on foreign policy today, Socialist member Sassani inquired about the Soviet Russia and Poland issue. Foreign Minister Barthou replied, "Do you want to know the government's thoughts on the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations? Your question is not difficult for me. I see the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations as a major event, and I am a person who cherishes peace, so I see the Soviet Union's joining the League of Nations as having a great relationship with peace. My words and actions in Warsaw were based on this, as were they in Geneva. Other than that, what else do you want to ask of me? There is only one question that seems too cautious to mention at this time, namely, what attitude will France take if the Soviet Union asks to be a permanent member of the League of Nations Executive Council? What is called cautious is that it is too early to say this, and Poland has priority in this matter. You all know that the League of Nations Executive Council once had a proposal to give a permanent member seat to Poland, and it was former Foreign Minister Briand who advocated this at the time in the Executive Council. What you want to know must be what attitude the French representative will take to resolve this issue when the League of Nations General Assembly is held in three months. Do you think that if both Soviet Russia and Poland demand a permanent seat, we will be unable to reconcile them? I hereby respectfully report that when meeting with Litvinov in Geneva, I was considering the conditions for the Soviet Union to join the League of Nations." (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

The agreement was negotiated by French General Gamelin and his staff with Russian Chargé d'Affaires Roseno. It stipulates that the two countries will exchange officers and military plans, and that it will avoid direct mutual assistance clauses as much as possible in its form to avoid arousing suspicion. This is also the slight difference between it and a formal military alliance. However, General Gamelin said that he will go to Moscow soon to fully decide how to expand its scope.

<p>According to news from the Romanian capital in the Hungarian capital, hundreds of Romanian officers wrote to General Averescu, saying that the promotion of certain officers was arbitrary, the morale of the army was dissatisfied, and the king expressed sympathy for the attitude of the soldiers. The people are also demanding clarification of the political situation, so the current government intends to withdraw. General Averescu has forwarded the officers' petition to the king. It is reported that General Averescu is negotiating with Balassiiano, the leader of the Liberal Party's faction, and Algetodoni, the leader of the political party, preparing to form a new government, and some people believe that the new cabinet will have the trend of an authoritarian government.

<p>(Geneva) Bedoya, the representative of the Republic of Paraguay to the League of Nations, has recently notified the League of Nations Executive Council that Bolivia does not comply with the rules of international law generally followed by civilized countries, so Paraguay, at present, has to deal with Bolivia in the same way, which is deeply regrettable. According to recent facts, Bolivia first used this kind of terrorist means. Although Paraguay has repeatedly negotiated diplomatically, hoping that Bolivia would abandon this barbaric means, it has been ineffective. Therefore, Paraguay's decision is justified. The Paraguayan government, although unwilling to use this kind of barbaric method, has no choice but to use the same method to treat it, because it is really forced to do so.

<h3 id="e29">Bulgaria Becomes a Hotbed of Global Narcotics Production: Influx of Materials Has Increased Greatly in Recent Years; Also Has a Large-Scale Transportation Organization; US Representative Addresses League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, US Representative Fuller, at a meeting of the Opium Advisory Committee, stated the inside story of Bulgaria's opium and narcotics trafficking. Fuller quoted Cairo Police Chief Russell as saying that Bulgaria is still one of the major sources of narcotics production in Europe, attracting villains from all over the world. In 1930, Bulgaria imported few materials for manufacturing narcotics. However, by 1933, the imported materials were sufficient to manufacture twelve times the amount of narcotics needed for legitimate purposes worldwide. Bulgaria currently has the most well-organized smuggling organization in the world, and a former Sofia police chief is the owner of a narcotics factory, while another Minister of Health also runs this business, it is said. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee held a meeting today. Austrian representative Sulzer chaired the meeting, and US Representative Fuller reported various narcotics figures to prove that the amount of anhydrous acetic acid manufactured in France and Germany and imported into Bulgaria has greatly increased. This anhydrous acetic acid can be used to manufacture as much as 6,000 kilograms of heroin, while the legitimate demand for heroin worldwide is only 1,500 kilograms. Canadian representative Sharman reported that Bulgaria's opium production in 1931 was 4,000 kilograms, which increased to 45,000 kilograms in 1932, and then increased by another 20,000 kilograms in 1933 to as much as 65,000 kilograms. Egyptian representative Russell explained that farmers in the Macedonian region of Bulgaria have switched to growing poppies because they cannot sell their tobacco and wheat. Neighboring countries, seeing the benefits, may follow suit, thus Macedonia has become a hotbed of opium and narcotics in Europe and the world. Italian representative Cavalchini hoped that the Bulgarian government would take strict measures. The Bulgarian representative then spoke, saying that since the establishment of the new Bulgarian government, his duties in this matter have been removed. However, the new government has decided to strictly fulfill its obligations and will take the measures required by the Advisory Committee, he assured. US Representative Fuller then spoke again, requesting France, Germany, and Bulgaria to submit reports on the export and import of anhydrous acetic acid. The committee subsequently passed a draft resolution stating that Article 15 of the International Convention (the International Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotics, signed on July 13, 1931) stipulates the establishment of a special administrative body to handle narcotics issues. Governments of all countries should submit reports to the Advisory Committee on the measures taken to establish this body and the methods to prevent the illegal sale of narcotics. The governments of all countries are also requested to collect information and report to the committee on the drug resistance situation of various international and domestic anti-narcotics groups and missionary organizations. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the Opium Advisory Committee released shocking news yesterday about Bulgaria's illegal manufacturing and sale of opium and narcotics, the Bulgarian representative declared today that the new government has dismissed the public health official mentioned by Egyptian Police Chief Russell. The new government has asked the League of Nations to provide information at any time so that it can quickly and seriously deal with the buying and selling of drugs, it is said. (Reuter, 26th)</p>

<p>Minneapolis The truck drivers' strike here, which lasted for many days, has now come to an end after the labor union and employers signed an agreement. The agreement stipulates the rights that workers should enjoy after working in the factory for many years, prohibits differential treatment of workers who join the union, and establishes a basis for arbitration to resolve disputes. In addition, it also includes clauses regarding wages and working hours. It is generally believed that this result is a victory for the workers. It is estimated that one person died and about a hundred people were injured in this labor unrest. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Toledo, Ohio Serious disturbances have been caused here by a strike at an electrical appliance factory. Demonstrators have clashed with the National Guard. A union leader has now declared that striking workers have rejected the conditions proposed by Labor Secretary Representative Taft at a meeting. Taft then declared to the union leader that the union leader should now propose conditions. Another shooting occurred at midnight last night, and a lieutenant officer of the National Guard and two bystanders were injured. Order was soon restored, but about 700 striking workers still surrounded the factory. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The continuing struggle between labor and capital has made people in the US capital uneasy.

<p>Istanbul Today, the government passed an order that foreigners employed in certain professions will be replaced by Turks. This order will affect thousands of foreigners living in Turkey. From May 21 to June 21, all foreigners serving as chauffeurs, barbers, tailors, shoemakers, hatters, translators, guides, stock exchange staff, and musicians must be dismissed. From June 21 to September 21, all foreign handicraft workers must stop working. From September 21 to November 21, foreigners employed in restaurants, cafes, etc., or street vendors, must be dismissed. From November 21 to January 21, 1935, foreign-run photography studios and printing houses must stop operating. From January 21, 1935 to March 21, foreigners selling state monopoly goods, artists, singers, and forwarding merchants must stop operating. From March 21 to May 21, managers of various businesses, government employees, and foreign staff in the Turkish government must be dismissed. This order was originally scheduled to be implemented last year, but was postponed due to protests from various governments. The most affected foreigners are Greeks, Italians, Persians, and British and Americans. These foreigners have lived here for decades, so their lives are particularly difficult to resolve. Some foreigners may change their nationality to Turkish, otherwise they may be expelled from the country. The Turkish government claims that there are many unemployed Turks, so it has to implement this measure, it is said. (Reuter, 25th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to a report in the Tokyo Newspaper, the Brazilian immigration restriction clause has been incorporated into the new constitution and is expected to be implemented in early June. The Brazilian government may allow only 3,400 Japanese immigrants to enter each year, but according to Brazilian newspapers, due to different calculation methods, it may only allow 400 immigrants to enter. Moreover, there is a risk of further reducing immigration in the future, which will greatly affect Japanese immigrants. (United Press, 26th)</p>

<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian published a letter from Dr. Wang Jingchun, which stated that the solemn guarantee issued by Japan to carefully abide by the existing treaties and agreements with China can be compared with the clauses of the Nine-Power Treaty, especially Article 1. However, Japan has seized China's four richest provinces and established a puppet government, whose powers, no matter how large or small, are all controlled by the Japanese. If clauses can be interpreted in a distorted way and contrary to their true meaning, then what is the value of having these treaties?

<p>(New York) The People's Forum reported that some believe that Britain and the United States are about to hold talks on naval issues, intending to form a common front to deal with Japan's demand to increase its navy. At the same time, Britain and the United States are forming an agreement to limit Japan's power in Asia. However, official circles have indicated that there is no such meaning, saying that in the preliminary talks of the naval conference, naval issues will be considered from a technical point of view, without focusing on politics. In addition, the US government is currently building four 10,000-ton cruisers with 6-inch guns. When this plan was decided last winter, the British government advised Washington to postpone this construction plan, saying that naval issues would be renegotiated in the future. If the results show that it is appropriate to build these cruisers, the US government can start construction again. The US government did not listen to this advice, and Congress approved the government's expenditure to build three more 10,000-ton cruisers, which shows that there are differences of opinion between the two sides. However, although the US Navy has added new ships in this way, it has not exceeded the limitations set by the Washington Treaty. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese government has notified the British government that Japan is prepared to participate in the preliminary talks of the 1935 Naval Conference. British people familiar with this issue claim that the most wonderful thing about the 1935 Naval Conference would be to hold it in Paris, because it would be suitable for such a conference not to be held in countries that are more directly related. In addition, British strategy seems to be based on a new principle, namely, that if war breaks out, Britain's maritime liaison with India should use the Cape of Good Hope as a channel, rather than passing through the Suez Canal again. The British government believes that the eastern Mediterranean is vulnerable to air raids, so it has this new principle. It is estimated that the British government will give instructions to the British delegation participating in the naval talks based on this new principle and determine the attitude it should take.

<p>(Tianjin) The "Youth League in China," organized by Japanese youth, has been very active here recently, so the possibility of unexpected incidents is still developing. When the Japanese ship Tianjin Maru arrived here on the 24th, a group of about 20 Japanese attempted to prevent customs officers from inspecting their luggage. Many of them wore the insignia of the "Youth League in China" and carried huge sticks. Customs officers then used ropes to create a barrier on the shore. Several Japanese jumped into the barrier and tried to drive away the customs officers. At that time, a customs officer notified his superiors by telephone.

This was due to reports that the joint review meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives had differing opinions on certain clauses of the Securities Exchange Management Act, leading to a stalemate. Sentiment thus became firmer. It is reported that market conditions were even more active after the close, with the prices of various stocks rising slightly, up to one point. At a time of labor unrest and uncertain circumstances, the market's resistance can be considered encouraging. The following is Jardine Matheson's report of the market prices of 15 New York securities (as of 10:45 AM):</p>

<h3 id="e105">Japanese-Puppet Opium Policy: Establishing the Daman Company; Capital of One Million Yuan; Poisoning the People of Four Provinces <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: It is an undeniable fact that Japan intends to use opium to exterminate our race. According to investigations, among the thirty million compatriots in the Northeast, as many as nine million are addicted to opium. They still consider this insufficient. Recently, in view of the opium purchases in Rehe Province and western Xing'an Province, although they are conducted by purchasers designated by the Rehe Opium Monopoly Bureau through its various sub-bureaus, the current purchasing situation in various places has become a competitive trend due to the scattered organization of the purchasers and a lack of control. This has made purchasing difficult and impossible to implement, resulting in smuggling. The Japanese-puppet authorities' response to this matter has been decided to adopt the organization of the puppet capital's Monopoly Bureau, under the guidance of Japanese Takeuchi, director of the Chengde Opium Monopoly Bureau. It intends to unite opium merchants from various places to organize the Daman Company, specializing in purchasing opium produced within the jurisdiction of the Rehe Monopoly Bureau, so that all opium produced will be transferred to the Monopoly Bureau. Zhang Yu Xuan is to be the general manager of the company, and Hu Mo Jie is to be the deputy manager. In addition, powerful opium merchants from Chengde, Pingquan, Baliwei, Lingyuan, Chaoyang, Chifeng, Weichang, and other places are all members. The purchase is funded by the buyers with a capital of one million yuan in puppet currency. It was founded on April 1st and received a permission order from the Puppet Ministry of Finance on April 20th. The company plans to purchase ten million yuan worth of opium in Rehe Province and western Xing'an Province. The opium is charged a handling fee of about one-tenth of a yuan per tael by the Monopoly Bureau. Since its founding, it has purchased about 300,000 taels of opium. The company's activities and locations of established branches are listed in detail below: (1) Location of branches and distribution of funds: Chengde 40,000, Pingquan 200,000, Lingyuan 70,000, Chaoyang 200,000, Chifeng 300,000, Weichang 200,000; (2) Sub-branches: 5 in Chengde jurisdiction, 2 in Pingquan jurisdiction, 4 in Chifeng jurisdiction, 1 in Weichang jurisdiction, 3 in Lingyuan jurisdiction, 5 in Chaoyang jurisdiction, and planned to open sub-branches in Fengning Anjiangtun and Tiantu towns; (3) Anti-Smuggling Measures: Currently, 15 secret investigation groups have been dispatched to the customs borders and provincial borders, and they are currently investigating.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Details of Rehe Volunteers Sacrificing Themselves Resisting Japan; Volunteer Liu Liangshan Killed 400 Japanese Soldiers; Exhausted of Ammunition and Without Reinforcements, Surrounded by the Enemy, He Committed Suicide <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The area around Wujiazi, Sanjiazi, and Weijiagou, the largest base of the Rehe Volunteer Army for the past two years, has suffered a brutal siege, burning, and killing by the Japanese army. According to recent reports from Rehe, Liu Cunqi, also known as Liangshan, the commander of the 9th Division of the Rehe National Salvation Army, was the bravest of the Rehe volunteers. He previously fought against several thousand Japanese soldiers in Wujiazi Weijiagou. In that battle, over a thousand volunteers and civilians died. At that time, Liu, wielding two guns, broke through the encirclement and escaped into the eastern mountain mine tunnels of Weijiagou. The Japanese army, because there were many tunnels, sent two soldiers to guard each tunnel. They retreated after ten days. Afterwards, the people entered the tunnel and saw that Liu had committed suicide. Only one bullet remained in his handgun. Everyone who saw this wept bitterly. Since the events in the East, many patriotic men in the Northeast have risen up to resist Japan. There are few who can lead by example, not avoiding sacrifice, like Liu. As for being exhausted of ammunition and without reinforcements, being surrounded by the enemy, and still committing suicide to show his steadfast will, he can truly be said to have done his utmost. No wonder those who saw this wept as if their hearts would break. According to reports, Liu was initially a sheep butcher. He enlisted in the army at the age of twenty. No one in the Liaoxi area does not know the name of Liangshan. Liu had a shiny bald head, so he called himself Liangshan. In mid-January of the previous year, he led patriotic youths from the Northeast to organize a volunteer army and recaptured Jinxi County. In just over twenty days, he killed three to four hundred Japanese soldiers. Japanese newspapers reported that the Battle of Jinxi was one of the battles with the most Japanese casualties since the Battle of Jiangqiao in Ma Zhanshan. The Liaoxi Volunteer Army Heng Qiao called himself Liu's unit. The Japanese army was shocked by his bravery and dared not advance. Liu initially served as the commander of the 36th Route Army of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army and later served as the commander of the 9th Division of the Northeast National Salvation Army. The army attacked Yi on October 20th of the previous year and Jin on the 25th. Liu was in charge of the main force on both occasions. He had accumulated over one hundred acres of fields. He has an old wife and an eldest son of about twenty-two years old, who is married and has a grandson, who is adorable. His second son is over ten years old. Currently, they are all unknown where they are drifting. (Northeast News Agency)</p>

<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Since the start of the Fifth Encirclement Campaign, the speed of the Northern Route Army's advance has truly set a new record in bandit suppression. After the Sixth Route Army recaptured Shanggu and Longgang, it immediately began building blockhouses and roads. The 59th and 90th Divisions of the Fourth Army put forth the most effort. The army officers inspected the work daily, and although the materials used were local, they did not harm the people at all. The roadbeds were solid, the surfaces smooth, the edges planted with trees, all in good order. Pavilions and public restrooms were also constructed in a very rational manner, making it a model highway in Jiangxi. Furthermore, many villages and houses in the Shanggu and Quejiaping areas were burned down by the Red bandits, and the residents were forced to move elsewhere, unable to return, thus delaying spring plowing. When the 90th Division was stationed there, it used local bamboo, wood, and thatch to build barracks, stretching for ten *li*, the lights at night as bright as a city scene, showing no sign of desolation. The officers and soldiers of the division rested there, climbing mountains and peaks several times a day, training diligently, showing a vigorous spirit, and fully displaying the vitality of modern soldiers. The nearby fields, because many people had not returned, were about to become barren. Division Commander Ou Zhen and Chief of Staff Huang Zhanchun, believing that spring plowing could not be abandoned, specially ordered their troops to cultivate the land for the people, personally leading the officers and soldiers to plant rice seedlings in the fields, setting an example for all units. Senior officials, after commanding troops, personally cultivated the land, filled with enthusiasm, plowing and harrowing like old farmers. The officers and soldiers worked harmoniously and diligently, planting dozens of *mu* of rice fields in two days. The people were all grateful and spread the word, happily returning one after another. It is also heard that orders have been issued to all regimental officers and soldiers to allocate labor to cultivate the land for the people, so that the residents can return to harvest. It is found that the bandit areas have been ravaged by bandits for many years, and now they have seen the light of day again. The Fourth Army has always been known for its bravery and good fighting, and strict discipline. Now they can also get close to the people, and the people deeply love them. The people's support is enough to affect the success or failure of the encirclement campaign. Seeing this, the pacification of the Red bandits is not far off.</p>

Preparations are now actively underway, and it will be established soon (24th).</p>
<h3 id="e109">Dredging Project of Jiangbei's Six-Pond River to be Completed by the End of the Month <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The Jiangbei Six-Pond River is crucial for transportation, irrigation, and drinking water for Huaiyin, Suqian, Siyang, Shuyang, Lianshui, Donghai, and Guanyun counties. Since construction began on January 1st of this year, the project has progressed exceptionally quickly. The project within Huaiyin and Siyang counties has been completed, and the remaining counties are expected to be completed in the near future. The construction process of the river and its recent situation are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>This dredging project of the Six-Pond River is being carried out entirely according to the three principles decided at the Jiangsu Province Six-Pond River Dredging Conference last year: (1) Deepen the riverbed from Xinei to Longgou to facilitate drainage; (2) Widen the dikes from Guji to Longgou to increase capacity; (3) Repair all dikes to prevent flooding. It is estimated that 2 million cubic meters of earth will be dredged and 3.5 million cubic meters of earth will be used to repair the dikes. The cost of earthwork, food, and the number of workers recruited from each county were also decided at the conference. The minimum price for dike construction is 4 *fen* per cubic meter, the maximum is 6 *fen*, and the average is 5 *fen*, which is determined temporarily by the engineering office based on local conditions and distance. The cost of excavating river soil is 7.7 *fen* per cubic meter for dirt, and 1 *jiao* per cubic meter for sand and gravel, averaging 8.5 *fen* per cubic meter, for a total cost of over 600,000 yuan. The number of workers recruited is estimated to be 8,000 in Suqian, 6,000 in Siyang, 4,000 in Huaiyin, 14,000 in Shuyang, 10,000 in Lianshui, 6,000 in Donghai, and 12,000 in Guanyun. After the conference closed on November 30th, the provincial government appointed Xu Dingkang, director of the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau, to concurrently serve as the director of the Six-Pond River Dredging Project Office. Xu departed from Yang for Qing on December 9th and established the engineering office on the 10th, dividing the entire river project into five sections, each with an engineer. After that, they began surveying the river channel, and the survey was completed by the end of the year. Dredging began on January 1st of this year, but the work was not rapid due to the Lunar New Year. Later, after the engineering office repeatedly ordered the counties to work hard, it began to proceed actively. The project within Huaiyin was completed on April 10th, and Siyang was completed on April 20th. The rest have also completed seven or eight tenths, and it should be fully completed by the end of May (26th).</p>
<h3 id="e110">Suzhou: Religious Philosophy Research Society Spreads Superstition <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Recently, a so-called Religious Philosophy Research Society was established in the Northern Temple on Pingmen Road, causing a social craze, with the whole city going mad. The details of the situation and an analysis of its content are as follows:</p>
<p>The society has an Ancestral Hall, in which hangs a portrait of a Mr. Xiao, neither Confucian nor Buddhist, with his hair tied up and holding a cleansing vase. In front of the portrait is a table, on which incense is burned. In front of the table are more than twenty *futons*. In addition, there is another Light Hall, in which a yellow cloth is hung like a silver screen. In front is an offering table, on which incense, flowers, and fresh fruit are offered. Two rows of *futons* are also arranged in front of the table. All who enter must take off their hats and shoes, hold their breath, and enter, performing the Three Kneelings and Nine Kowtows. Moreover, not just anyone can enter; they must be someone with some reputation in society and recognized as having innate goodness, before they can be led in by someone from the society. It is said that after performing the ceremony and gazing at the screen, one can see the forms of all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as one wishes. In the end, it is just a kind of legend. All those from various circles who join, regardless of gender, can do so with a member's introduction and paying a fee as usual. The procedure is to first pay respects to the statue of the founder, kneeling on a *futon* for about two hours, called "receiving light," and then enter the Light Hall to worship as usual. In this way, they have the supernatural power to treat people's illnesses. The society claims to be a mixture of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, separately worshipping Mr. Xiao as the founder and establishing a new school, taking not feeling the pulse and not using medicine to treat people's illnesses as its work. After joining the society, one must sacrifice everything and dedicate oneself to the society, including women. The reason is that so-called "adult gentlemen" have also joined to call upon each other, so many people believe in it. The gods worshipped by the people in the society, some of whom may never see the teacher, Mr. Xiao, in their lifetime, suddenly arrived the other day, gave a public lecture, and hosted a vegetarian meal. However, Mr. Xiao's way of treating diseases is to use the righteousness of silently reciting the twenty characters of loyalty, forgiveness, integrity, and clarity, which is different from his disciples' claim that "the Bodhisattva will save you." According to some people, Mr. Xiao is like the so-called "senior brother" of the Boxer Rebellion. Since the establishment of the society, in less than two weeks, no fewer than thousands of patients from far and near have come to seek treatment every day. Currently, party members Jiang Yuqi and Zhu Mengmei have submitted a report to the county party headquarters, stating that the society has not yet been ordered by the party headquarters to be approved for preparation, and has already been giving diagnosis for treating people's illnesses without medicine or feeling the pulse, causing foolish men and women to flock to it like crazy. No fewer than one or two thousand people go to seek treatment every day. The method of treating diseases is to take a piece of gauze, which is written with a talisman by the practitioner, burned to ashes, and given to the patient to take, saying that it can cure the disease. In the end, no one who has been treated has seen any effect, and it is said that there is even a risk of worsening the condition. This is blatant promotion of superstition, confusing the foolish people, disrupting social views, and endangering lives. It is requested that the county government be transferred to strictly order the Public Security Bureau to dissolve it immediately. The county party headquarters' Standing Committee member Zhu, based on the report, has sent a letter to the county government to investigate and handle it.</p>

<p>A sailing ship traveling between Suzhou and Xuzhuang, owned by Ge Huangyao, encountered a bandit ship near Shangfang Mountain in Shihu on the afternoon of the 25th. There were four bandits with guns who boarded the ship and robbed the passengers. All six passengers were searched, and more than one hundred yuan were robbed. Afterwards, the shipowner reported the theft to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Wuxi: Implementing Silkworm Cocoon Control: Officials and Merchants Firmly Contend <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Since the Construction Department of this county promulgated the Cocoon Control Measures, various parties have had different opinions. Therefore, at 2:00 p.m. on the 24th, an emergency meeting was held at the Silk Factory Trade Association, and four measures were decided and submitted to the authorities for a petition to postpone implementation. The situation was reported in this newspaper, stating that when funds are needed for unregistered cocoon businesses, they should all be rejected, etc. The contention between officials and merchants is quite firm. Yan Shenyu, the magistrate of this county, and Cai Jingde, the deputy director of the model district, considering that the cocoon market is approaching and it is difficult to delay, specially went to the province the other day to ask Shen, the director of the Construction Department, for instructions on a solution. Director Shen, after hearing the report, was quite firm, stating that cocoon control is one of the entire provincial measures to rescue the silk industry. The Chinese silk industry has reached its most dangerous state. If improvements are not sought urgently, it will inevitably be subject to international competition and fall into bankruptcy. The livelihoods of farmers and the status of merchants will be fundamentally affected. In any case, there can be no changes. As for the collection of improvement fees, Zhejiang Province has already implemented it last autumn and is collecting it slightly again this year. There is precedent. Moreover, the improvement fees are specifically for the improvement of the silk industry and are different from taxes. If there are a few people who do not understand the situation, disregard the future interests of farmers, and intentionally obstruct the progress of the business, they will be severely suppressed. Those who do not comply with the measures to register and accept customers to start a business will have their cocoon licenses revoked. If they do not register or pay the guarantee money and collect cocoons without authorization, once discovered, in addition to detaining the dry cocoons, they will also be charged double the improvement fee as punishment. After receiving the instructions, Yan and Cai returned to Wuxi yesterday morning (26th) and decided to handle the matter in accordance with Director Shen's instructions. Therefore, it is feared that a solution cannot be reached for a while.</p>

<p>The case of promoting the new system of weights and measures in this county has been implemented by various industries one after another. Only the rice and bean industry has been slow to implement it. After repeated urging by officials, the Rice and Bean Industry Association has successively sent the measuring instruments used to the county for inspection. More than 340 pieces have already been sent, and the county government will complete the inspection of the qualified measuring units, which can then be standardized.</p>

<p>Zhou Zhaofu, a resident of Dongfeng, Zhouxin Town in this county, is a tycoon in the silk and iron industry, owning assets of four to five million. His business operations extend to various ports in Shanghai, Wuhan, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Dalian. His father, Shunqing, was a fourth-rank official in the late Qing Dynasty and had jointly founded the Xincheng Bank with Prince Qing Yikuang, causing a sensation. After Shunqing's death, Zhaofu followed in his father's footsteps and continued the business established by his father. In addition to the Yuchang, Shenchang, and Dingchang three silk factories in Wuxi, there are also the Xinyuanlai Smelting Workshop in the Nanshi area of Shanghai (jointly operated with the Hu family, with assets of 400,000), the Yixu Wharf in the Nanshi area of Shanghai (with assets of over 100,000), the Xinzhenyuan Smelting Workshop in Suzhou, the Suzhou Yuchangxiang Iron Company (with assets of 100,000), the Shanghai Zhengchang Iron Company, as well as the Pudong warehouse, the Zhengchangren Iron Company in Hankou, the Shengyuan Oil Mill in Dalian (jointly operated with Ye Hongying), etc. He also owns land worth over 20,000 yuan in Nagasaki, Japan. He owns a residence on Qipu Road in Shanghai, more than 3,000 *mu* of farmland and street houses in the northern township of Wuxi and Zhouxin Town. In recent years, Zhou's business has failed, causing the Shanghai Zhengchang Iron Company, the Hankou Zhengchangren Iron Company, etc. to close down one after another. The residence on Qipu Road in Shanghai and the Pudong warehouse have also been mortgaged. Recently, due to financial difficulties, he has declared bankruptcy, owing more than 1.5 million yuan. He has entrusted lawyer Sun Zuhong to liquidate. For the debts owed to banks and money shops, the Yuchang, Dingchang, and Shenchang three silk factories have been mortgaged, but this is still not enough. For the debts owed to depositors, totaling more than 200,000, it is proposed to compensate with more than 680 *mu* of farmland, with each 1,000 yuan receiving about 1.3 *mu* of land. The creditors do not agree, resulting in no result. A creditor group has now been formed to negotiate. However, it is heard that Zhou Zhaofu still has 400,000 yuan in deposits at the Bank of China and more than 2,000 *mu* of farmland, which are said to have been donated to the Yizhuang.</p>

<p>Wu Xiaochi, director of the Jiangjing Business Tax Bureau, sent a letter to the Fish and North Goods Trade Association, requesting them to collect business tax on salted yellow croaker, as the yellow croaker season is approaching. The association sent a letter to the Hupu Fish Trade Association in Changshu for consultation. It was reported that fish tax and fishery tax had long been explicitly exempted by the National Government. Salted yellow croaker is collected from the ocean by fishing boats and is not transported for sale, so it is different from the nature of business. Moreover, *lijin* has also been abolished long ago, and collecting tax on goods is a disguised form of restoring *lijin*. The business tax should naturally be refused.</p>

<p>Gu Fengxiang, aged 65, of Gujiazhai, Zouma Township in the Second District, had a son, A Xiang, who worked as a butcher. On the morning of the 25th, father and son went to Chenjiahang Town to buy wine and drank together. A Xiang drank wildly and became drunk. After drinking, they went home together. Fengxiang ordered his family to dry salted fish. A Xiang objected, and they disagreed. A Xiang went to his room and took out the sharp knife he used for butchering pigs and stabbed his father in the upper part of his thigh, piercing through his lower abdomen. Fengxiang immediately fainted and died shortly after. The local township police officer Meng Zhendu reported the incident to the Nanxiang Public Security Bureau, which dispatched patrol chief Sun Yuzhen and police officers to investigate and confirm the facts. However, the murder weapon was missing. A Xiang was taken to the bureau and sent to the County Public Security Bureau. Director Xue Bingyang interrogated him, and he confessed that he was 46 years old and that he had stabbed his father. He said that he stabbed him in the thigh because he was drunk at about 9:00 a.m. The county government detained him that evening. The next morning, presiding judge Shao Ling and police officers went to the countryside to conduct an on-site investigation and confirmed that he had been stabbed to death before his death. The family was ordered to prepare the coffin.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Speech by the Head of the Delegation <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Zhan Jing Tang, the head of the Qingdao Industrial Inspection Delegation, reported, "Our delegation's mission in coming to Shanghai to inspect industry is twofold: Firstly, Shanghai and Qingdao are the two major ports of China. Geographically, there are close relations in commerce and trade. The value of imported goods through Qingdao's Jiaohai Customs approximates over 50 million yuan in national currency annually. Given the importance of this port, it is imperative that entrepreneurs, traders, and economists pay special attention and jointly seek ways to recover our rights and interests. Secondly, Qingdao has only been under our control for a little over ten years. During this time, it has experienced multiple civil wars, leading to extreme panic in the market. Since Mayor Shen took office, he has vigorously promoted industry and developed the market. In recent years, there has been a slight industrial foundation, but compared with the construction technology achievements of major factories in Shanghai, the difference is like night and day. We hope that entrepreneurs and technicians in Shanghai will provide more assistance and contributions. Thirdly, Qingdao has such a good port, and the annual consumption is so large. The raw materials of inland industrial products are abundant, such as coal, tobacco, peanuts, cowhide, and wool, which can be fully supplied. For every bit more that domestic goods are sold, a portion of economic rights and interests is recovered. We hope that the gentlemen of the press will vigorously promote and advocate on behalf of the 400,000 compatriots in Qingdao, to treat Qingdao as the Qingdao of all Chinese people, and to build Qingdao into a Chicago of the United States or a Manchester of the United Kingdom, instead of viewing Qingdao as an oriental Switzerland or a playground park within our country. Moreover, our delegation believes that the press represents public opinion, and our industrial circles regard the gentlemen of the press as our nurses. Qingdao's industry is still in its infancy, and Shanghai's newspapers are popular throughout the country and overseas. One call from the top will resonate across all the mountains. Therefore, Qingdao's new industries, such as needle making, frozen powder manufacturing, cowhide glue manufacturing, and China Stone Company, all rely on sales channels to have hope for development. The Shanghai press is the mentor of Qingdao's nascent industry, which is also the heartfelt prayer of our delegation."</p>
<h3 id="e128">Response by the Representative <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Ma Yinliang, representing the press, stood up to reply, saying, "We are deeply honored by your delegation's invitation. Many people from various places come to Shanghai for sightseeing, but none leave a deeper impression on us than your delegation. Your delegation is named after Qingdao, and these two words remind us of the various unfortunate events that have occurred since it was taken from the hands of foreigners and returned to us, which are unbearable to contemplate. Secondly, your delegation takes industrial inspection as its mission, breaking away from the regionalism of the past, which will undoubtedly be beneficial to the development of our country's industrial future. Now that we are about to part, I would like to offer a cup of wine on behalf of the hosts, to wish your delegation good health and the development of Qingdao's industry."</p>

<p>The delegation's visit to Shanghai has been warmly welcomed by all circles. Now that the delegation has completed its inspection and will be leaving Shanghai tomorrow, it has decided to host a banquet for all circles at the New Asia Restaurant at 7:00 pm today to express its gratitude and strengthen ties. Invitations were sent out yesterday, totaling over two hundred copies. Invitees include Mayor Wu, the Secretary of the Municipal Government, heads of various departments, heads of various bureaus, all members of the China General Federation of Industry, all members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, all members of the Production and Sales Cooperation Association, all members of the Mechanized National Goods Factory Federation, all members of the Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Goods, as well as various industrial and commercial organizations, and leaders of industry and commerce.</p>

<p>The company's Shanghai-Hankou route was originally scheduled for flights between Shanghai and Hankou every day from Tuesday to Sunday at 8:00 am, arriving at around 3:00 pm respectively. Now, due to the extraordinary development of the route's business, passengers and mail are quite crowded. In order to facilitate travel, the company has decided to fly as usual on Mondays, which were originally rest days, adding one flight to meet the needs. That is, there will be flights every day of the week, and the company has decided to implement this from next month (June) 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Earlier Flights <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>In addition, the company, considering that it is now summer and the weather is getting hotter, will also advance the flight time. All westbound and eastbound flights between Shanghai and Hankou will take off at 7:00 am every day, arriving at 2:05 pm respectively. At the same time, the flight time of the Shanghai-Beiping route will also be advanced. That is, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 6:30 am, flights will depart south from Beiping, and on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday at 6:00 am, flights will depart north from Shanghai, all arriving at 3:30 pm in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The association specially sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, contributing opinions on rent reduction. The original text reads: "The Shanghai rent reduction movement has lasted for four months and has become a prerequisite for Shanghai's prosperity, which is attracting the attention of Chinese and foreign people. Recently, we learned that your council has been instructed by the municipal government to discuss the issue of rent. Therefore, we would like to offer our humble opinions as follows: (1) We believe that housing is one of the four major elements of life and an indispensable thing for mankind. The prices of clothing and food are now much lower than before. The reason for this is related to the social economy, that is, the prices of clothing and food change with the social economy. The same is true for rent. What was the price of rent before the rise of trust transactions? Anyone who has been in Shanghai for a long time can tell. In the past ten years or so, whether it is a resident or a shop, although it seems to bear this high rent with reluctance and pain on the surface, the desire for rent reduction has been eager to try. Therefore, the current widespread rent reduction movement can respond to every call with swift momentum, which shows that it is entirely due to accumulation and indignation, which is the natural principle among human beings. Since the outbreak of the two major changes of "September 18" and "January 28", the social economy has felt extremely uneasy, and Shanghai's prosperity will be declared bankrupt. The so-called big price cuts in the current commercial market are everywhere. Other examples include the recall of agricultural plates, unemployment of workers, and the increasing number of rent arrears cases in the courts. Based on this, it is enough to prove that the reduction or non-reduction of rent is closely related to Shanghai's prosperity. This is one thing that should be noted. (2) We have heard that the silver and money industries are deeply concerned about the issue of rent reduction. The reason they hold is that rent is the interest on real estate. If the rent is reduced, it will inevitably affect its property price. Because many houses in Shanghai are mortgaged to the silver and money industries, the trend of rent reduction must not be allowed to grow. However, it is too rigid to know this. It should be known that the silver and money industries also make mortgages on silk, rice, yarn, etc. Judging from past facts, the price has fallen miserably after being mortgaged, which is often heard. The mortgage of real estate is the same. Why worry? The current rent reduction has been forced by circumstances. For example, in the distant past, countries such as Germany and Japan also had government orders for rent reduction. Recently, in our country, Nanjing's rent reduction and the Central Political Council's promulgation of rent standards, our association dares to say that the rent reduction movement is actually beneficial to society. All industries are members of society. If it is beneficial to society, then there is no harm to the industry that does mortgages. May I ask if the increase in land prices in Shanghai is not caused by ordinary tenants? Because tenants gather together in that area, each running their lives, becoming a market, resulting in the daily increase in land prices, the so-called sacrifice of the public, creating their personal wealth, this has been explained in detail in the third lecture of the Principle of People's Livelihood. This is the second thing that should be noted. (3) There are many disputes about rent reduction methods. Some advocate the main area principle, some advocate the interest principle, and some advocate the house price principle. However, Shanghai has a vast area and houses are densely packed. If the above-mentioned principles are followed, it is necessary to start an investigation, but often those who do not understand the overall situation will conceal the facts. It is feared that it will not be easy to do so even in a few years. It is to save society and disturb society. It is often seen that the methods formulated by the Rent Reduction Committee are calculated by the year of construction, which is suitable for the urgent needs of society. This rent reduction movement is an unavoidable move, aimed at promoting the market, helping each other, uniting, and saving the crisis together, and there is no hostility between them. This rent reduction method should be submitted to your council for adoption by the municipal government, and the formulated methods should be implemented immediately. This is the third thing that should be noted. In summary, it seems to be practical and easy to implement. We hope that you will examine it carefully."</p>

<p>According to Dakungpao, after all the workers of the New Factory of British American Tobacco Company announced a general strike, the situation is quite serious. The party and government organs are paying close attention. The Municipal Government specially summoned the responsible persons of the Fifth District Cigarette Trade Union yesterday to go for talks in order to find ways to mediate. The strike committee telegraphed Chairman Chiang, requesting that the company be ordered to resume operations immediately in order to quell the dispute. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>More than 5,000 workers and Chinese staff of the New Factory of British American Tobacco Company, in order to support the workers of the Old Factory, announced a general strike on the 24th, resulting in a complete standstill of work in various departments. Even the cigarettes in stock cannot be shipped. Yesterday, the workers of the factory continued to strike. The British-American small steamer drivers also joined the strike yesterday after the trade union sent a letter of warning. The company re-hired White Russian drivers.</p>
<p>Inside the factory, such as in the engine room and the furnace room, there are still a small number of White Russians working, but all other work has stopped. The company has not made any statement so far, and the workers have not sent anyone to negotiate with the company. The two sides are still in a stalemate.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government believes that the situation of the British-American workers' strike is serious. If a solution is not found quickly, it will not only affect the workers' livelihood but also affect local security. Therefore, in addition to ordering the Social Bureau to find a way to mediate, it also summoned the responsible persons of the Fifth District Cigarette Trade Union at 11:00 am yesterday to go for talks. The labor side sent Chen Peide and Lou Jingguan. Secretary-General Yu met with them and inquired in detail about the reasons for the factory's closure and the workers' strike. The representatives also requested the Municipal Government to order the factory to resume operations immediately in order to quell the strike. Mr. Yu expressed his acceptance and hoped that the workers would be informed to strictly maintain order and not to expand the dispute in order to avoid causing other incidents.</p>

<p>Guangxi Province has always been known for its poor people and barren land. In recent years, after repeated efforts by the authorities, it has achieved some scale, and construction work must rely on the economy as a prerequisite. During the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, when Chairman Huang Xuchu of Guangxi Province visited Shanghai, he discussed investment matters with the financial circles in Shanghai. Guo Shun promised to invest 3 million yuan to help the construction of the province. Later, financial figure Jin Guobao, industrialist Zheng Yizhi, and others went to inspect. It is now learned that Guo Shun and others have raised 2 million yuan with Huang Zhongyue, the director of the Finance Department of the province (half from Shanghai and half from Guangxi), to establish a Yongkang Industrial Company in Wuzhou, specializing in connecting the industrial undertakings between Shanghai and Guangxi. After the matter was actively carried out by both Shanghai and Guangxi, Huang Zhongyue of Guangxi Province recently sent a telegram to Guo Shun, stating, "The developers' meeting of Yongkang Company in Wuzhou has elected directors and supervisors, and the board of directors has been established, recommending you (i.e., Guo Shun) as chairman and Zheng Yizhi as general manager. It is truly fortunate for Yongkang to obtain talents. The future of Guangxi's industry is deeply relied upon. We also hope that you will come to Guangxi to preside over the overall plan so that we can often ask for your advice. We are extremely honored, so we send this telegram to inform you." It is heard that the company has been prepared and will be established in Wuzhou on July 3.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake, and Allied Trades Association, requesting that, following the example of Qingdao, the Ministry of Finance be requested to reduce the export tax on peanuts and other local products shipped overseas from Shanghai and exempt the transit tax for transportation to various ports in the country for two years, etc. The Chamber immediately reported the situation to the Ministry of Finance. The original text has been seen in previous reports. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance approved the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Received and noted. After verification by the Ministry, it has been approved to reduce the originally set export tax rate for peanuts, peanut kernels, and peanut oil shipped overseas from Shanghai by 60%, limited to those shipped overseas within three months, that is, from May 26 of this year to August 25. The Director-General of Customs has also been ordered to inform the customs to comply. As for the request to exempt the transit tax, the Ministry has carefully examined and verified that peanuts and other products are major local products of Shandong, which have a direct relationship with the market in Qingdao. The situation is different from those transshipped to Shanghai, and Shanghai is a gathering area for various freights. The amount of peanuts transshipped has no significant impact on the prosperity or decline of the market and cannot be compared with Qingdao, which mainly trades in peanuts. The request cannot be approved. You should immediately inform them accordingly. This approval."</p>

<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession sent a letter to the Board of Directors of the French Concession yesterday, stating, "Dear Sirs, According to a letter from the Second District Branch of the Citizens of the Second Special District (address: Gongguan Road), according to a letter from the silver shop industry in the French Concession, our industry has always had no miscellaneous taxes other than the house tax. Before the French Board of Directors started levying the classified business hygiene tax, they first tried the silver shop antique hygiene tax. Our industry has already recognized the silver shop tax, so naturally we cannot recognize the classified hygiene tax again. Unexpectedly, the French Board of Directors suddenly levied the classified business hygiene tax on our industry again this year, that is, in addition to the silver shop hygiene tax, there is also a so-called classified hygiene tax, which is actually a double tax on one place and one industry. Our industry is really difficult to recognize, etc. Therefore, we have sent a letter to request that your association convey to the French Board of Directors to exempt the double tax, etc. We have specially recorded the letter and forwarded it to you, and we pray that you will check it out."</p>

<h3 id="e152">Report of the Red Swastika Society on the Handling of Disaster Relief Work in Pingyin and Dong'a Counties: 2,500 Hectares of Fertile Land Have Been Dredged, but Two-Thirds Still Lack Funds for Further Work <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Office of the World Red Swastika Society, in response to the severe flooding in Dongping and Dong'a counties in Shandong Province last year, specifically raised disaster relief funds and handed them over to the Jinan Red Swastika Society to carry out emergency relief efforts. This included dredging the Yellow River estuary in Dong'a County and areas south to Songjiatun in Dongping County. To date, 7,600 yuan has been raised, along with donations from the Provincial Disaster Relief Association and the Northeast Charity Federation, totaling 25,600 yuan. We have now received a report from the project office regarding the dredging situation, stating that the Society's handling of the emergency relief and work relief in Pingyin and Dong'a counties was supported by philanthropists from various provinces, the Provincial Disaster Relief Association, and others. A large-scale porridge kitchen was set up in the disaster area, and a work relief office was organized to begin dredging the entire section of the Yellow River estuary. The project extends from the Yellow River estuary in Dong'a County in the north to Songjiatun in Dongping County in the south, a total of forty *li* (approximately 20 kilometers). The northern section, where sedimentation is highest and work is most difficult, accounts for one-third of the entire section. This construction first started here, and a total of 4,800 to 6,000 local laborers were gathered, each receiving 1.3 *jiao* for food per day. Foremen were appointed from village chiefs, numbering 357, each receiving 2.3 *jiao* for food per day. It was originally planned that this dangerous section could be completed in twenty days. However, due to rain twice and snow once, work was delayed. Furthermore, the passage of bandit gangs under the leadership of Liu further slowed the work, extending it to thirty-two days before this dangerous section was completed. A total of 20,421.5 yuan was spent. Villages contributed grain worth over 20,000 yuan, bringing the total cost to over 40,000 yuan. Only one-third of the entire project was completed, which is a significant discrepancy from the original estimate. According to last winter's original estimate by the Dongping County government, the entire project of forty *li* would only require 20,000 yuan. Only after actual construction began was it realized that the original estimate was far too low. The County government was only aware of the work within Dongping County, which was not very difficult, and was unaware that the area within Dong'a County had been heavily silted up by the Yellow River last autumn, as high as mounds. Currently, there is a constant stream of appeals for outside funds, and the villagers are also struggling to provide grain. Furthermore, the planting season has arrived, so work had to be suspended and the water released. An estimated 2,500 *qing* (approximately 16,667 hectares) of land has been drained, all of which is planted with barley, with some sorghum. This success is due to the generosity and advocacy of major philanthropists. However, in the Pingyin and Dong'a areas, over 5,000 *qing* of land have been flooded. This dredging project has only covered one-third, and only half of the flooded land has been drained. If the remaining two-thirds of the southern section can be dredged, all 5,000 *qing* of land can be drained. This is a fundamental aspect of disaster relief that cannot be delayed. According to the contractor's report, the southern section is easier than the northern section, and another 25,000 yuan would ensure its completion. Therefore, repeated requests have been made to the Shandong Provincial Government in recent months, but only 5,000 yuan has been approved for continued funding, leaving a significant shortfall and risking the failure of the entire effort. It is urgently hoped that the great philanthropists in Shanghai will continue to provide assistance so that the entire project can be completed and all 5,000 *qing* of flooded land can be drained. Not only will the people be spared starvation and be able to cultivate their land like those in other counties, but the philanthropists will also have cultivated a field of merit without end. Furthermore, Qinghemen is silted up every year due to backflow of Yellow River water. If the entire project is completed, it can guarantee a small wheat harvest within two or three years. However, annual dredging would be difficult. The heads of all townships and towns in the disaster area have jointly decided to build a mud dredging boat. If there is accumulated silt, the boat can be used to冲挖(*chungwa* to use the force of water from a boat to break up the mud and silt). This would require less effort and achieve greater results. In this way, the generosity of the philanthropists will never be wasted. The cost of building the boat is around 80,000 yuan, which will be funded from the harvest of the drained land. This is stated jointly.</p>

<p>Since Yang Xudian, the organizing committee member of the Chinese Maritime Workers' Union, began to act negatively, the union's affairs were nearly brought to a standstill. He Zhenhuan, Wu Yongsheng, Mu Yeyi, and others from the organizing committee have now resigned to the central government, citing difficult working conditions. However, it is reported that the central government has telegraphed to persuade them to stay, stating that the resolution of the 17th has been reserved. Here are two telegrams that have been obtained:</p>
<p>He et al.'s Resignation Telegram to the Nanjing Central Executive Committee: The maritime workers' organizing committee bears great responsibility and arduous tasks. However, the situation has deteriorated daily, and work is difficult. Since Mr. Xiaotian has retired, it has become even more difficult to advance the union's affairs. As maritime workers, Zhenhuan and others cannot bear to delay and cause harm in the future. Therefore, we telegraph to earnestly resign from our positions. We humbly request your approval. He Zhenhuan, Wang Yongsheng, Mu Yeyi.</p>
<p>Central Government's Telegram of Consolation to the He Zhenhuan, Wang Yongsheng, Mu Yeyi and other comrades of the Preparatory Committee of the Maritime Workers' Union: Your telegram has been received.

<p>Since the import tax on foreign sugar was increased, the amount of foreign sugar smuggled into our country for sale in the past year has accounted for as much as four-tenths of the total amount. Not only has customs revenue suffered a major loss, but the impact on sugar merchants' businesses has been even greater. In order to strictly investigate the source of sugar smuggling, the Tianjin Customs specially dispatched agents to various ports along the coast of North China to secretly investigate. After months of investigation, they discovered that the smuggling originated from Chuanjiacun, Xinggepu and other places near Dalian, where foreign sugar was secretly loaded onto ships, then transferred to junks along the coast and privately transported to Qingdao, Haizhou, and outside Wusongkou, and then smuggled into the interior. In this year, the amount smuggled into our country has reached several million yuan. It is reported that the Japanese authorities in Dalian have been notified to strictly cooperate in the investigation and crackdown.</p>

<p>The *shikumen* (stone gate) residence at No. 15 Taixingfang, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, houses Hu Peigeng, a secret 波(*bo* person, a transliteration indicating a foreigner) from the Shunchang Machine Factory on Baotong Road, and Bao Wanglin, a postal worker. The attic is occupied by artist Shi Ruihua's family. Hu is the sub-landlord. The factory specializes in manufacturing various flashlights. Since the boycott of foreign goods and the promotion of domestic goods, business has greatly flourished, resulting in a slight surplus, which was coveted by bandits. Yesterday morning at 7:30 AM, Hu's female servant Jiang Dongshi was washing a chamber pot at the back door when four bandits wearing long gowns and short shirts suddenly broke in through the</p>

<p>and forced the female servant inside, brandishing handguns, forbidding her to make a sound. They drove the Hu family and others into a dark room behind the living room and held them captive. Then they ransacked the boxes and chests, looting Hu Peigeng's jade ring, gemstone ring, pearl necklace, etc., Shi Ruihua's gold ring and woolen coat, etc., and Bao Wanglin's leather suitcase containing $16 in paper money and $0.11 in small coins. Just as they were about to escape with the stolen goods, the bandits did not notice Bao Wanglin's wife, who was outside Hu's back door buying broad beans from a vendor when they entered the house. The vendor through the glass door</p>

<p>and quickly reported the robbery to the police at Post No. 44 in the Fifth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who relayed it to District Chief Liang Fuchu. Liang Fuchu led Superintendent Wang Molin, Officer Gao Chunshan, the entire patrol squad, and detectives Yu Hanwen and Lu Hexiang, fully armed, to the address. Seeing that the front and back doors of the house were locked, District Chief Liang urgently ordered the police and detectives to surround the house and ordered the other residents to stay inside. At the same time, he directed Police Chief Wang Molin and others to cross the wall from the roof of No. 10 and climb to the drying platform of No. 15. The police and detectives obeyed orders and rushed forward bravely. The bandits heard the urgent knocking on the door below and realized that something was wrong. They quickly turned around and ran upstairs, but the police chiefs who had crossed the wall from the roof of No. 10 had already reached the drying platform of No. 15. Seeing that the front and back exits were blocked, the bandits opened fire in desperation. The police and detectives also returned fire. The gunfire on both sides was as dense as interlocking beads, as if</p>

<p>As a result, the bandits were overwhelmed. At the same time, the police and detectives successively rushed in and apprehended three bandits upstairs. They then saw another bandit resisting arrest below the stairs. They quickly aimed at his chest and fired a shot, hitting him. He fell to the ground on the spot and died, bleeding profusely. His death was horrifying. They seized a "No. 29157" six-inch Harmon gun, a cartridge case, and two remaining bullets. They were then brought to the District for interrogation. The bandits confessed, saying, "Lu Erbao, 26 years old, from Taicang," and directly admitted to the robbery. When interrogated about the other two bandits, they confessed, "Sun Quanjing, 25 years old, from Shandong, lives in Room 38 of the Tianran Hotel in the concession. The</p>

<p>is Li Er, in his twenties, from Taicang. There are also accomplices on the run, Little Brother and Lin Amao." They also revealed their hiding places. Yu Bingsheng (also known as Amao), 25 years old, from Shaoxing, also admitted that he was led to Hu's house by Wang Xingmiao, who was still at large, to commit robbery. The officials then led the bandits, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession Police Station, to No. 210 Caishi Road to arrest Wang and to No. 170 Mingdelili, Malong Road, to arrest Lin, but they had already fled upon hearing the news and disappeared without a trace. They were then taken to the District for detention. The seized stolen goods were identified by the victims. The three bandits and the handgun were handed over to the General Bureau for legal proceedings. The police and detectives bravely captured the bandits and did not let any escape, which is commendable. Therefore, District Chief Liang Fuchu, in addition to reporting the situation to the General Bureau, also allocated 100 洋 (*yang*, silver dollar) from his official salary</p>

<h3 id="e166">The Continental Daily Praises Xinhua Village: Elegant and Quiet Environment, Excellent Facilities <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily on May 24, "The population and houses of Shanghai are increasing day by day. It has become the most serious problem today for new and old residents who want to find spacious housing and a quiet environment because of the weakness of social and economic forces. Some people live in the bustling areas of the concession, and because of the high rent, living in a pigeonhole has become a popular saying. The houses are small, the air is full of smoke and dust, and it is constantly noisy. Some people move to the western suburbs of Shanghai because it is more suitable for living conditions, but they suffer from the high cost. Therefore, the former live in apartments and climb mountains to get home, while the latter travel too far and are covered in dust. The Xinhua Bank pays close attention to the housing problem in Shanghai and attempts to solve the housing problem for the general public with their enthusiasm for serving society. Therefore, Xinhua Village was built on Xitiyuhui Road in northern Shanghai, with convenient location, convenient transportation, excellent environment, and economical living conditions. Xinhua Village covers an area of 50 *mu* (approximately 3.3 hectares) and is only one mile from Hongkou Park. There are main roads to the Public Concession and the Shanghai Haixin District. The house foundations in the new village have been demarcated. Trees are planted between the houses, and there are clean and elegant lawns and gardens. Exquisite and beautiful houses are being built. When the entire project is completed in the future, it will definitely become the best and newest residential area in Shanghai. The method of purchasing housing in Xinhua Village is different from that of general real estate companies. The Xinhua Bank knows that the general public lacks the whole amount of money to purchase a house, so it adopts the method of paying in installments, combining repayment with rent payment. It can be very easily and unconsciously, after a few years, the house will belong to you. The village is surrounded by beautiful and quiet countryside, without any of the hustle and bustle of the city, but with wide and flat roads and convenient transportation. If you take a private car, it only takes 13 minutes. Public buses also only take 22 minutes to travel between the new village and the Bund. In addition, there is a route that is Tiantong'an and Jiangwan, which is where the Songhu Railway passes. Therefore, it is also very convenient for general businessmen and women to live there. Although Xinhua Village is not in the concession area, the various facilities are as convenient as those in the concession. For example, water and electricity are supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, and telephone calls can be directly connected to the Public Concession and the French Concession. Water and electricity fees and rent are also cheaper than in the concession. In addition, the village is very close to the school district, and there are all levels of schools from kindergartens to universities, such as Shanghai Law School, Chizhi College, Fudan University, Aiguo Women's School, and Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School. In the future, for the convenience of the residents, small vegetable markets and mailboxes will also be set up. In addition to the above-mentioned advantages, Xinhua Village also has a very good outdoor sports environment. Usually, you can take a walk in Hongkou Park, or swim in the park's swimming pool, or go horseback riding on the open road in Jiangwan. It is indeed an ideal paradise."</p>

<p>The case of Liu Shufan, former Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and others, for embezzlement and harming the national treasury, was prosecuted by the Prosecutor's Office of the First Special District Court. Judge Liu Yugui repeatedly held court hearings. The details have been repeatedly recorded in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu, together with Prosecutor Zhong Qing, continued to hear the case. Liang Banxing, secretary of the preparatory office of the Daxin Company, was summoned to court to investigate the situation of the defendant Zhao Baoshan using a portion of the commission from the land purchase by the Savings and Remittance Bureau to subscribe for Daxin shares. According to Liang, the company received 23,025 taels of silver from four households, Yang Wubentang, Yang Shude, Zhao Huiji, etc., equivalent to 30,000 Hong Kong dollars, which was delivered by the Zhao surname. He also presented the receipt books and subscription forms. Judge Liu then asked Zhao Baoshan and Yang Peichang about the commissions they received and how Zhao purchased Daxin shares. Then, he presented the postal savings regulations and repeatedly cross-examined Liu Shufan and others about the procedures for withdrawing savings with checks. Then, he ordered the debate to begin. Prosecutor Zhong first stated the arguments of the case, roughly dividing the case into two parts: (1) The part involving the commission of Zhao Baoshan and Yang Peichang; (2) The part involving the purchase and sale of government bonds by Liu Shufan and others. Zhong then stated the reasons for the defendants' crimes in the government bond trading incident, saying that the usual practice is for banks to require customers to deposit margin before buying and selling government bonds on behalf of customers. However, the defendants advanced over 400,000 yuan to the Daison Company for buying and selling government bonds without calculating interest, while the 100,000 taels of silver deposited in the account of Liu Jianhou, which they claimed to be margin, was calculated daily. This clearly favored one party over the other. In fact, the name of the Daison Company account was actually the defendant himself, and he deliberately created a name to cover up the facts. Their actions have violated Articles 136, 140, and 366 of the Criminal Code. Next, he stated the reasons for the crimes of Zhao Baoshan and others obtaining illegal commissions, saying that the amount obtained by the defendants in the two land purchases was 135,000 taels and 29,000 taels, respectively, of which Yang Jianping shared 34,325 taels. According to the customary practice of land sales, the commission is generally 1% or 1.5% of the property price. However, the property price on Albert Road was 1.2 million taels, and the commission reached 150,000 taels, which is 1/8 of the property price. There has never been such a shocking commission. It is clear that the defendants colluded with Yang Jianping, internally and externally, to inflate the property price and openly embezzle the funds. The facts are clear, and he requested that the defendants be judged according to law. Then, the defense lawyers of the defendants, Liu Chongyou, Shi Jiong, Cao Shoulin, Zou Yu, and Liu Shifang, defended their clients in turn. The court then adjourned to schedule sentencing.</p>

<p>Sheng Xingcun, formerly a Palace Guardian of the Qing Dynasty, has a residence located at 526 Jing'an Temple Road, a large and spacious property. However, due to the building's age and dilapidated walls, the rear of the house is being renovated. As a result, all the important trunks and belongings of his descendants' various households are stored in one room, called the storage room, and sealed. A servant named Ruan Ronggen is assigned to guard it. Ruan, a native of Anhui, was hired by Sheng Gongbao's second concubine and has served for twenty years. He is usually very honest and has no bad habits. However, recently, due to indulging in certain habits, he has been short on funds. After much deliberation, he takes a risk. On the 22nd of this month, at 2:30 AM, before dawn, in the quiet of the night, he colludes with a relative, someone named Jia, to open the locked storage room. They select two boxes of important clothes, valued at 9,554 yuan, and steal them. They hire rickshaws to take them to a friend's house, intending to pawn them later. The matter is discovered by the Sheng family. Noticing that the seals on the boxes are broken, they inspect further and realize that clothes worth ten thousand yuan are missing. However, they don't know who stole them at the time, and Ruan remains calm and continues to serve as usual. Subsequently, Huang Dazhong, representing the Sheng family, reports the matter to the New Gate Police Station. The station immediately dispatches Chinese Detective Tang Jian, Yao Yuanlong, Detective Lu Gendi, Jiang Juwu, Constable Xia Yeshan, and Western Detective Qi Jiasheng. After days of detailed investigation, they find the Sheng family's servant, Ruan Ronggen, suspicious and evasive. Yesterday, they take Ruan to the police station for questioning. Ruan confesses to the theft and leads the Chinese and Western detectives to 334 Mei Baek Road and 97 Father Jin Road in the French Concession. There, they apprehend two more suspects, Dou Guanghua and Yin Bengen, and recover most of the stolen goods, over 7,700 yuan worth of clothes. They are all taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they are sent to the First Special Court, Criminal Division Eight. The police station's lawyer, Gan Jingguang, presents the case and requests a postponement to investigate the remaining stolen goods. Judge Wu Zehan briefly questions the defendants and orders them to be remanded in custody separately, pending further investigation and questioning.</p>

<p>Shen Mingming, a local resident of Ninghe Road, Yangshupu, with no house number, is an elderly man of seventy years. He is a local bailiff with a prosperous family. Recently, Chinese Detective Xu Guirong of the Narcotics Division discovers that he is selling "red pills" (narcotics). He reports this to Western Detective Chief Bai Pu, who, on the morning of the previous day at around 10 AM, secretly goes with a court warrant. They arrest Shen at his address and find a "double corner" coin, used as a marker by an informant who bought pills from him, in his possession. They also find four packages of "red pills," estimated to be several thousand, in an old bamboo basket of clothes under the porch, and an opium lamp in the bedroom. Nothing else is found. They are all taken to the Yangshupu Police Station. The head of the station orders him detained. The next morning, he is sent to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division Three. The Municipal Council lawyer, Wang Yuetang, states that on the 16th and 17th of this month, Detective Xu sent an informant to the defendant's place, each time buying two small packets of pills for two "corners." The third time, he used a penknife to mark the "double corner" coin as a secret sign. He then bought another small packet, and the Chinese and Western detectives immediately entered and arrested him. He is now being prosecuted under Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. He presents the confiscated evidence: the "double corner" coin, seven packages of "red pills" of various sizes, and the opium lamp for inspection. Subsequently, according to the Chinese and Western detectives' report of the investigation, the defendant claims that he does not sell "red pills," that he has known Detective Xu for many years, and that there is a feud between them, so he is deliberately framing him. He says that yesterday morning, Xu sent his colleagues to invite him out for tea twice, but he refused. During that time, they secretly put the "red pills" in the bamboo basket, and the "double corner" coin was also put into his pocket when he was arrested. He states that the opium lamp was used when he was sick. He says that if he were selling "red pills," he would gladly accept execution. Detective Xu denies the defendant's claims. A woman from Suzhou, Wu Sijin, testifies that she is the defendant's tenant and has lived with him for over ten years, and that he does not sell "red pills." An informant from Haizhou named Zhang Defa testifies that he bought a small packet of "red pills" for two "corners" from the defendant three times, and that he personally handed them over each time. Judge Xiao Xiefen, based on the conclusive evidence, sentences Shen Mingming to two years imprisonment and a fine of 1,000 yuan. The evidence is confiscated. The defendant's lawyer declares an appeal and requests bail, presenting a guarantee from dozens of neighboring shops, which is rejected. He is returned to custody.</p>

<p>According to the Tokyo Kokumin Shinbun on the 18th, recently, the issue of students frequenting dance halls and the mahjong gambling incidents involving students from Tokyo University and Keio University have occurred successively. The disruption of school discipline has already raised concerns among informed people. Unexpectedly, students from Rikkyo University, which is run by a missionary group and known for its unique reputation, have been continuously gambling at mahjong in the classrooms. The inside story is particularly shocking. Students such as Yamagishi Hisao and twenty others often use chips instead of cash (five cents or ten cents). Since February of this year, they have been gambling wildly at mahjong in the classrooms, taking advantage of teachers' absences or breaks. A classmate stands guard outside to prevent anyone from knowing. Therefore, not only is the outside world unaware of the situation, but even the school authorities have difficulty seeing their hidden activities. Later, because it has been going on for a long time, a delinquent named Takagi, since late April, often visits the school with his younger brother, who is also a delinquent, wanting to meet with these students. He also threatens them, demanding twenty yuan per person as a "gift," or he will secretly report them to the police. Takagi manages to extort several hundred yuan in blackmail money. Later, feeling increasingly dangerous, he flees and goes into hiding. Thus, the truth of the case is gradually exposed.</p>

<p>The joint collection method of transport car and sedan chair surcharge for Moganshan, previously agreed upon by the Two Road Bureaus, the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau, and the Moganshan Management Office, roughly stipulates that the Highway Bureau and the Two Road Bureaus collect a surcharge for joint transport passengers' cars and sedan chairs on behalf of the Moganshan Management Bureau. The surcharge rates are: (A) Car surcharge: First, second, and third class passengers, adults 20 cents per person, children (age according to railway regulations) 10 cents per person; (B) Sedan chair surcharge: sedan chair bearers 10 cents per person. Those who purchase round-trip tickets will be charged double the above rates. The effective period of this method was originally until the end of the 22nd year. The bureau intends to continue for another year after the expiration, and has separately sent letters to the Road Bureau to agree. The bureau believes that this agreement is beneficial to the overall construction of the mountain, so it should do its best to support it. However, the wording in Article 5 of the agreement, "The Railway Bureau is represented by the Chief of the Hangzhou Train Section," should be changed to "The Railway Bureau is represented by the Chief of the Hangzhou-Jiaza Train Section or the Manager of the Moganshan Railway Hotel" to conform to the current organization of the road. Railway staff traveling from Hangzhou to Moganshan or from the mountain back to Hangzhou will provide proof by a letter from the Section Chief or Hotel Manager to avoid paying the car and sedan chair surcharge. It has been separately replied and ordered the relevant departments to comply.</p>

<p>At around noon the day before yesterday, a middle-aged man of about thirty years of age, speaking Cantonese, wearing a blue-grey silk spring gown and a grey felt hat, checked into Room No. 2 of the Jinde Apartment at 737 North Sichuan Road. He looked haggard and walked unsteadily. He claimed to be named Li Dechen, a merchant from Guangdong, 29 years old. He paid a room fee of two yuan. After the tea boy brought the tea and water and left, he closed the door tightly. At 5 PM, he opened the door and called the tea boy to buy him food. Around 7 PM, he ordered a bowl of noodles from the tea boy, ate it, and then went to bed. Unexpectedly, at around midnight, there was a groan in the room. The tea boys heard it and suspected something was wrong. They rushed forward and knocked on the door, but there was no response for a long time. They quickly reported to the accounting room and tried to use a wooden ladder to look into the room from the air vent with a flashlight. They saw the guest lying stiffly in bed, motionless. Knowing that something had happened, they climbed in from the balcony and turned on the light. They saw him foaming at the mouth and barely breathing. They immediately reported to the 1st Precinct of the 5th District and notified the Fire Brigade to send a fire truck to take him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. However, he had taken too much poison and died at around 4 AM yesterday morning. The police station sent officers to investigate and reported to the court for an inspection yesterday morning. At the same time, they found two suicide notes under the pillow. One was addressed to the apartment, asking them to notify his friend Chen Rutian to handle the funeral. The other was addressed to Chen Rutian, stating, "Last night, after eating at Tan Manji, I went to the Hongkou Hotel to commit suicide by poisoning. Because I bought too little opium (six jiao), I suffered all night without dying. Today I took poison, buying one yuan's worth of opium, which should kill me," signed "Brother Xie Xiushan." Therefore, it was learned that the deceased's real name was Xie Xiushan. He had first attempted suicide by poisoning at the Hongkou Hotel, but had failed. So he moved to the Hongkou Apartment to end his life. The reason for the suicide is unknown. A photograph of the deceased and some women was found next to the deceased's body. On the back was written, "Please have Chen Rutian publish this photo in the newspaper to ask someone to claim the body," The 1st Precinct of the 5th District is currently investigating Chen Rutian, hoping to uncover the truth.</p>

<p>Guanghua brand cigarettes, produced by China Huamei Tobacco Company, are known as China's standard cigarettes because their quality, price, decoration, and flavor are in line with the principles of promoting domestic cigarettes. They were first appreciated by the banking community, and they quickly spread to various places. In less than two months, they have become a popular item for banquets and gifts.

<h3 id="e183">Domestic Electrical Machinery is Being Promoted <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Most of the machinery used by power plants across the country are imported products. The money flowing out of the electricity industry every year is enormous. It is recently learned that the New Electricity World magazine, hosted by Mr. Deng Zi'an, has an electrical industry introduction department that specializes in promoting domestically produced electrical machinery. The magazine has been in Shanghai for more than two years and has connections with power plants and electrical experts across the country. Currently, the introduction department is promoting domestically produced electrical transformers manufactured by Yizhong Fuji Machinery and Porcelain Electric Company. Mr. Deng has issued a letter to power plants and electrical experts across the country, inviting them to work together to use domestic products. It is hoped that this can also be a good opportunity for Chinese manufacturers of electrical machinery. The letter states: "Dear Sir, Today, if China wants to become wealthy and strong, it must increase domestic production. Our country's electricity industry is growing rapidly, and the electrical machinery it needs is mostly purchased from abroad. The annual amount of money exported has reached more than ten million yuan. The industry should find ways to prevent this outflow. Recently, the whole country is promoting domestic products. If everyone adopts a portion of domestic goods and focuses on manufacturing, the domestic industry will be revitalized to a certain extent, and the country will preserve a portion of its vitality. As for transformers needed in the electrical industry, Shanghai's Yizhong Fuji Machinery and Porcelain Electric Company manufactures them, specializing in transformers, current limiting tables, and various electrical porcelain materials. The company has been established for nearly fifteen years, and most of the managers are technical experts. All the power plants that have used their products have praised them, and the prices are lower than imported products. Domestically produced electrical machinery has already replaced foreign products. We hope that domestic electrical factories will promote and use these transformers as much as possible to show the glory of domestic products, increase the country's wealth, and encourage manufacturers to make further efforts. We believe that you are enthusiastic about the domestic electricity industry and will not be left behind. We hope that you can work together to achieve the joy of self-sufficiency as soon as possible. If your factory wants to try these transformers, you can directly contact the company (110 Hankou Road, Shanghai) for detailed inquiries. If you have any inconveniences in communicating and inquiring directly, our introduction department can handle everything for you. Out of the sincerity of promoting domestic products, we are sending this letter to you. Deng Zi'an of the Introduction Department of Shanghai New Electricity World Magazine."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Hall is working hard to compile the city's gazetteer with the spirit of unity and hard work. In order to solicit scholars' guidance and public criticism, it has printed several drafts in quarterly installments and published a periodical, which is distributed to various sectors. Not only is the status of the hall's work specifically proved by the periodical, but also its hard work and uncompromising attitude are spread to the academic community. In a very short period of time, people have not only been able to predict that the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer will open a new era in Chinese local gazetteers, but also confirmed the hall as one of China's important academic institutions. However, due to funding constraints, the number of copies of the periodical published by the hall is very limited. Before it could be widely distributed, it was already requested. Many groups and individuals in the city and other places have sent letters requesting copies because they have not been able to read it, which the hall deeply regrets. It is learned that the hall is taking advantage of the full year of publication of this periodical to carefully proofread and reprint 300 copies of the year's periodicals, which are bound together to meet the needs. The bound volume has more than 1,100 pages and about 700,000 words. It contains historical records of various sectors of Shanghai, including politics, the Public Concession, the French Concession, diplomacy, finance, art, industry, and social undertakings, ranging from tens of thousands to more than 100,000 words. It is essential for those who are interested in studying Shanghai and want to understand the important history of China in the past century. Each volume is priced at five yuan, plus one yuan for postage outside the city. Those who need it can purchase it directly from the hall at 291 Sapo Sai Road, Shanghai, to avoid missing the opportunity again.</p>

<p>The electrical appliance industry is a type of scientific manufacturing industry. Twenty years ago, all the electrical appliances needed in our country were imported, causing a loss of tens of millions of dollars each year. Mr. Hu Xiyuan, the general manager of the Eveready Electric Factory in this city, has been operating diligently over the years, and his achievements have been quite remarkable. In addition to manufacturing domestic light bulbs, Mr. Hu also opened a factory on Poyang Road in the 18th year of the Republic of China to manufacture various electric fans, electric clocks, and electric stoves. Since their introduction to the market, they have been highly praised by all sectors. Recently, as the summer season has arrived, orders for electric fans from this city and other places have been pouring in, so the factory's work has become even busier.</p>

<p>Car driver Gao Chunsheng, at approximately 9:00 AM on March 22nd of this year, drove private car number 892, owned by Russian doctor Mai Qi (transliteration), eastward along Avenue Joffre in the French Concession to the tram station near Rue Lupan. Due to the driver's carelessness, Wang Mo (courtesy name Bingqing) from Shaoxing, who was the head of the documentation section of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, was hit and killed. The French police's traffic department arrested Gao and transferred him to the Second Special District Local Court for public prosecution. The victim's family also filed a civil suit, seeking damages of 30,000 yuan. The first instance sentenced Gao to three years in prison and ordered him to compensate the victim's family with 5,000 yuan in damages. Gao, dissatisfied with the original judgment, appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The court recently held a hearing. In the private suit portion, an out-of-court settlement was reached with compensation of 2,600 yuan, to be paid in three installments. The public suit portion was declared closed, pending sentencing. The previous report had already noted these details. Yesterday, Judge Guo, along with Assessors Sun and Fan, held a hearing and announced the judgment: the original judgment was overturned, and Gao Chunsheng was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for causing death due to negligence in his profession. The number of days of detention before the judgment is finalized will be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day, reducing the sentence by half compared to the original judgment. It is reported that Gao still expressed dissatisfaction and intends to file a third appeal to the Supreme Court, hoping to escape punishment.</p>

<p>The Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Center spares no effort in its contribution to publishing. Now, the center's first research report, "The Rural Movement of Today in China," has been published. The book was written by Mr. Kong Xuexiong, a researcher at the center, and it provides a very detailed account of the rural movements in various parts of the country over the past ten years. It includes detailed descriptions of experimental movements in various places, such as the work in Ding County, Zouping, and Zhenping. It also provides systematic discussions on the development of various rural construction theories, such as village governance theories, rural education, and local autonomy. All the descriptions are based on actual investigations and are not empty theories. At a time when rural revitalization is being highly promoted, this book is the best reference material for both those working in rural areas and researchers of rural issues. The content includes a general discussion of the meaning and conditions of the rural movement, rural construction in Shandong, the Ding County experimental work of the Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement, rural improvement projects and mass education in Jiangsu, the people's militia and autonomy in Zhenping in the bandit area, the rural credit cooperative undertakings in Hebei, the movement from Xiaozhuang School to the work-study groups, and the Xiaoshan Dongxiang autonomy under party-led governance, all of which are extremely brilliant. Finally, it summarizes the gains and losses of the work in various places and his personal opinions. It covers the general trends of the rural reconstruction movement in China in recent years, as well as the works that can be called representative works, almost without omission. In addition, there is a preface by Mr. Sun Zhesheng and three appendices, including a survey of national rural improvement projects and a directory of rural movement workers, which are also relatively complete.

<p>The "Jing'an" steamer of the Sanbei Steamer Company, which operates on the Shanghai-Hankou line, has been detained for more than 40 days since Yu Shicheng accused it of sinking a small steamer from Fuzhou and requested the court to impound it, resulting in significant losses. Moreover, the company's manager, Yu Qiaqing, believes that the sinking of the small steamer from Fuzhou was not caused by the "Jing'an" steamer at all. The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau's Ship Collision Dispute Resolution Committee conducted a detailed investigation of the case, collecting witness testimonies and material evidence, and determined that the collision was not caused by the "Jing'an" steamer. Now, private shipping companies are outraged by the innocent detention of the "Jing'an" steamer, fearing that this will lead to a situation where everyone feels insecure. They have decided to convene a meeting in the coming days to discuss and petition the government for its release, and they will not stop until their goal is achieved.</p>

<p>Zhang Shunsheng, a native of Changzhou, runs a rubber stamp and ox-horn handle workshop at No. 100 Ziyoufang, Guangdong Road. Zhang Bingqing also runs the Yongxing Bookstore on Wangping Street. Previously, due to business competition, they had convened fellow merchants to agree on a uniform price of one jiao and two fen per ox-horn handle, which was not to be discounted. However, Zhang Shunsheng recently suddenly reduced the price to seven fen and seven li, which is more than three fen and five li lower than the agreed-upon price. Zhang Bingqing learned of this and, at 8:20 PM last night, led his shop assistants Liu Xingsheng and Li Delin to Zhang Shunsheng's place to reason with him, inviting him to a teahouse to discuss the matter. Unexpectedly, Zhang Shunsheng, knowing he was in the wrong, used a chisel from his workshop to stab Zhang Bingqing's thigh and both arms five times, all the way through, causing him to fall to the ground immediately. When Liu Xingsheng stepped forward to stop him, he was also stabbed in the eyebrow and chest. Zhang Shunsheng, realizing he had caused trouble, begged Liu and Zhang not to report him to the police, offering to send them to the hospital for treatment, with all medical expenses to be borne by him. He then took Liu and Zhang to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital notified the Laozha Police Station, which dispatched Detective Wang Yifei to arrest Zhang Shunsheng and detain him at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division One. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, explained the case and filed charges under Article 294 of the Criminal Law. Zhang Bingqing recounted the situation at the time, saying, "I fainted three times yesterday after being stabbed, and the pain is unbearable." When questioned, the defendant confessed that he was slapped in the face by the plaintiffs and his front teeth were loosened, causing him to become disoriented, which led to the disaster. Judge Feng Shide, after verifying the confession, sentenced Zhang Shunsheng to seven months in prison for using a method sufficient to cause serious injury to harm another person.</p>

Recently, his shop has become difficult to maintain and is about to close down. Zhu, feeling that there was no way out, conceived the idea of death. The night before, he went alone to the Central Hotel on Wuma Road, booked room 329, and swallowed raw opium in secret to commit suicide.

<p>Reading and Answering Questions</p>

<p>I sincerely request your guidance for the knowledge required for my work.</p>
<p>My current position is equivalent to a library administrator, but with a different title. Therefore, I would like to acquire some knowledge about "statistics," "classification," and "cataloging." I wonder if there are any books on this subject? Which bookstores publish them? Please give me a detailed answer.</p>
<p>Also, I would like to study printing techniques in my spare time. I wonder if there are any magazines or books in China that specialize in printing? Please also give me instructions. I would be very grateful!</p>
<p>丨Letter from Xu Zhusan丨</p>
<p>Knowledge required for work is the most practical knowledge. I think this kind of demand is certainly not limited to Mr. Xu alone, and this aspect of social guidance has always been neglected. This column has rarely discussed this kind of problem before, but it is not that we have not paid attention to it. In fact, it is very difficult to answer these very common questions. In the past, we had not found talents in many fields. For example, once a painter asked us some chemical questions, and we could not find anyone to answer them, so we often could not satisfy the readers' wishes. This time, Mr. Xu's question about library knowledge has come to our own home.</p>
<p>However, before we discuss the practical knowledge needed in this kind of work, we must first understand what kind of department his work is in. What kind of difficulties are encountered in the specific work? What are the specific contents and scope? If there is no boundary, our answers will be difficult to start.</p>
<p>The questions raised by Mr. Xu seem to us to be vague, general, and abstract. Although he mentioned "statistics," "classification," and "cataloging," he did not point out any narrower scope of these questions. Therefore, we can only write something based on our general understanding of library science below...</p>
<p>1. Classification is the most arduous task in a library, which is generally acknowledged. The meaning of book classification is what is generally called "putting things of the same quality together." However, at first glance, this seems to have a clear meaning and no difficulty, but in fact, it often happens that a book can be classified into two or three or more categories. When encountering this kind of divergence and ambiguity, it often takes a lot of time to think hard, so doing this work sometimes makes people impatient because they cannot get the most appropriate category. But sometimes, you will also feel happy and interested in it. However, even though we say this, there are always principles and experiences to follow in handling any matter. Let us cite three points below: (1) Since there is no absolute scientific category for book classification, we can use theory as the basis on the one hand, and facts as the premise on the other hand, and integrate the two in the middle. The only thing we need to do is to make the books convenient to use. Then, it is possible to sacrifice a little academic law. For example, electrical engineering in natural science and electrical engineering in applied technology, the former is about the principles of electricity in natural science; the latter is about the technology of electricity in applied technology. According to theory, the two examples mentioned above should be given two categories, but if there are not many collections, and at the same time, in order to refer to a certain problem and avoid scattering, it is very reasonable to summarize them in one category. (2) When determining the category of each book, try to take the higher meaning. For example, if there is a book about the "May 30th Incident," this book can be divided into Sino-Japanese and Sino-British diplomatic issues, or it can be divided into modern Chinese history, but it is definitely not as great as the meaning of being divided into the Chinese national liberation revolutionary movement. (3) The order of classification has considerable significance, and this point must also be based on academic laws as much as possible. For example, if there are several books about the history of social thought, it is necessary to consider the order of occurrence and not to reverse the order.</p>
<p>The three items mentioned above are the general key arguments of the classification method. At the same time, it is too short to write about this aspect of academic theory here, and we cannot list them one by one. As for the question of which method to use for classification, we generally agree with the Dewey Decimal System because it has flexibility. If the library is small and there are not many books, it only needs to use the outline. If the scale is large and there are many books, the outline and detailed items can be used together. If the outline and detailed items are still not enough, decimal points can be added.</p>
<p>(2) Cataloging is a more complete work after the classification work in the library. With a complete catalog in the library, readers can use the guidance of the catalog to retrieve the information they want in their minds. However, this cataloging is the most practical and must rely on practice to understand. Moreover, the cataloging depends entirely on the needs and simplification of the library to determine the work. Some libraries only make a book title catalog, and some libraries also have an author catalog, subject catalog, classification catalog, and even a dictionary catalog. However, most libraries usually have two catalogs: book title and author. There are many rules for the cataloging method, and it is difficult to list them in fact. Fortunately, there is a special book introduction below, so I will not repeat it here.</p>
<p>(3) We also think that the problem of statistics is similar to the situation of cataloging, that is, how to count the materials generated in the work that Mr. Xu proposed. This all depends on the actual needs. As for the principles and methods of statistics, the following books can be used for reference.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding magazines and books specializing in printing technology, we have not heard of them in China. Recently, the Commercial Press's Publishing Weekly has a column "Common Sense of Printing" from the 75th issue, which is also worth reading. Today, the newspaper reported that the Commercial Press published a book on modern printing technology, priced at four jiao. We specially went to buy and read it. It is said that it is still their maiden work. These little things may slightly fill your desire for printing knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Group Performance <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of the conference. There were 35 group exercises. Among them, the Southern District Elementary School's national salvation expression exercises had a profound meaning, the Yucai Elementary School's Boy Scout flag language exercises were neat and skilled, the Daotong Affiliated Elementary School's fitness dance was lively and delightful, the Jingqin Elementary School's Eight Brocades exercise was full of energy, and especially the deaf-mute exercises of the deaf-mute school attached to the Qunxue Society were neat and uniform, just like ordinary people, which was most appreciated by the audience. Other performances, such as Chenjing clapping exercises, Qilu imitation exercises, Kaiming dumbbell exercises, and Dunhua three-set boxing, were also excellent.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Competition Overview <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>▲In the Men's Class A 200-meter race, after Zhu Hongqi achieved an excellent record of 11.5 seconds in the 100-meter final the day before yesterday, people generally expected that there would be remarkable results in yesterday's 100-meter race. Zhu Aixian was one step behind at the start. Shang Wen's Zhu Yimai outside the 100-meter mark showed a desire to win the championship. Wan Zhu's Zhu began to show his expression. In the end, Zhu Hongqi was able to break the finish line first, but the score was 25.8 seconds.</p>
<p>▲Regarding the Men's Class A 800-meter race, those who discuss primary school physical education all advocate that track and field races should mostly use 400 meters as the long-distance run, because young children have insufficient energy, spirit, and vitality. In yesterday's 800-meter race, except for the champion Shang Wen's Fu Yuanxiang, who was still able to cope, the rest all reached the finish line, but all had an exhausted look.</p>
<p>▲He Angao and Lian He'an are gifted in the 110-meter low hurdles. If they can be allowed to diligently cultivate their skills, their future is promising. Observing the grace of their hurdling posture and the sprint to the finish line, they all have the demeanor of experienced scholars. Shang Wen's Shen Ruxin started with the majestic posture of Cheng Jinguang, but unfortunately, his stamina was still weak, and the score of 15.6 seconds was not bad.</p>
<p>▲In the standing long jump, Zhu Hongqi once again took the top spot, and Hua Zhi, who came in second, was also brave and commendable. The initial difference between the two was extremely small. The current record for this event is 5.71 meters, and with time, it will surely be active on the field.</p>
<p>▲In the pole vault, Hong Gen mostly uses a rolling style when crossing the bar, and the posture still needs to be corrected. Guang Gong, who took fourth place, and the little black charcoal He Dongchun, although their scores were not as good as the top three, they competed with others for the third place in the sixth, seventh, and eighth attempts, and finally won the fourth place, which was not easy. Although it is not excellent, it must not be ignored because of its small size. It is necessary</p>
<p>Hong Gen's spirit of finally thrusting the pole and rising is commendable.</p>
<p>▲In the Men's Class B and C 200-meter race, Wan Zhu's Su Longzhang won the championship due to his good sprinting ability. He'an's He Genlong, although ranked third, still showed ease. Zheng Liangzhi and Tan Jihao are both outstanding among the young players, and their efforts at the start and finish line are comparable to those of adults.</p>
<p>▲In the 800-meter relay, Shang Wen has many 200-meter runners, such as Zhu Aixian, Hu Shihua, and Shen Ruxin, all of whom are eagerly watching. In the first leg, Wan Zhu once had the upper hand, but the second leg shrank significantly. By the time of the fourth leg, although Zhu Hongqi was brave, it was difficult to bring the team back to life.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Xiangbin Cup Table Tennis: Guangdong Champion; Jiande Absent from Final <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The 7th Xiangbin Cup Table Tennis Tournament was held as scheduled last night at the Meifeng Table Tennis Room. Previously, the presidium of the cup tournament organizing committee, in view of the previous request to postpone the final, which had a significant impact, sent letters to both the Guangdong and Jiande teams the day before yesterday, stating that if they were absent from the final, they would be dealt with in accordance with Article 7, Paragraph 9 of the cup tournament rules on "withdrawal midway." Unexpectedly, three hours before the final, letters were received from both teams requesting a postponement of the competition, the reason being a conflict with the Chinese team's preliminary selection time (according to the so-called Chinese team preliminary selection, it is said that it is being prepared for the "Far East Sino-Japanese Table Tennis Competition" to be held next month). The committee immediately replied, stating that all matters had been arranged long ago, and it would be difficult to comply with the request to postpone the competition. It also explained that now that the Far East Games have been illegally dissolved, even the Sino-Japanese tennis exhibition match has been canceled, so why bother with table tennis? Therefore, it hoped that they would still attend on time. When the final came, the Guangdong team indeed understood the greater good and attended in full, while the Jiande team, except for the captain Lu Zhongqiu, all were absent. The referee Zhou Weixin announced that Jiande had forfeited the match, and the representative of the cup tournament organizing committee explained the circumstances, stating that it should be considered a withdrawal midway, and all their competition results in this tournament should be canceled. Therefore, this year's championship was won by the Guangdong team. The runners-up were promoted in order, with Tianma and Meifeng teams tied for second place, each receiving a pennant as encouragement. Ms. Shi Shuming presented the awards on the spot, followed by a happy banquet and refreshments.</p>

<p>The Shanghai China Table Tennis Association, because the China-Japan International Table Tennis Championship was scheduled to be held in Shanghai, China in early June, held preliminary selections for the Chinese team on the evening of the 23rd of this month in order to select true talent. However, since this year's Far East Games were undermined by the Japanese, people across the country were outraged. The Japanese side wanted to fulfill its long-cherished wish to participate with its pseudo-nation, and used its so-called ghost tactics of illegally producing the East Asia Amateur Sports Association, which is not worth a smile from knowledgeable people. It is now learned that the association is indignant about the unreasonable undermining of the Far East Games by the Japanese, so it has decided to send a telegram to Japan rejecting the visit to Shanghai for the competition. As for the preliminary selection of the Chinese team, which is a regular association affair that the association should hold, it will still be held as usual to assess the skills of each individual.</p>

<p>▲Sports Performance... Tonight</p>
<p>The Southeast Women's Physical Education Teachers' School 10th Anniversary Celebration will hold a sports performance tonight (the 27th). The program is extensive and the performances are novel. All kinds of costumes and clothing are made by the students of the school themselves. Therefore, preparations have been extremely busy recently. Also, this performance of the school is mostly based on various dances, so it is specially held in the evening. Various colored lights have been installed at the school's track and field field, and a paifang has been built in front of the main gate. The school is also concerned that it will be inconvenient for guests to travel back and forth late at night, so it has contacted the China Merchants Public Bus Company and obtained permission to run the No. 4 public bus until 12:00 AM.</p>

<h3 id="e227">Junior High Student from Provincial Nanjing Middle School Drowns While Swimming <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Gao, a 19-year-old student in the Junior High School Class A of the Provincial Nanjing Middle School's Second Academy, a native of Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, went to exercise on the playground as usual after school at 4:00 PM on the 25th of this month (the playground of the school's Second Academy is outside the school walls, which are very low, and recently they were knocked down by outsiders, making it very easy to climb out). When it was time for self-study at 7:00 PM, the student was missing. While they were searching for him, Chen Ju and other students from Anhui Middle School reported to the school that Zhou Gao was swimming in the swimming pool outside Tongji Gate near the Jiulong Bridge and suddenly disappeared. Upon hearing this, the junior high school director immediately instructed the regular supervisor and the student's homeroom teacher, Zhou Zhongchen, and physical education teacher Li Kehang, along with six other faculty members, to rush to the scene. At the same time, they reported to the principal (at the First Academy). After the homeroom teacher and others arrived at the Jiulong Bridge, they immediately hired local bailiff Wang Hong to hire people to retrieve the body. After about half an hour, they managed to pull the student ashore. His limbs were already stiff, and his abdomen had caved in. Li Kehang tried to use artificial respiration to resuscitate him, but it was ineffective. They then ordered the bailiff to guard the body and dispatched four more school workers from the school to jointly watch over it. Upon hearing the news, the principal immediately went to the Second Academy and sent someone with a letter to the student's home in Xijiao Village, Chunhua Town, outside Tongji Gate, to inform his parents. Three supervisors from the Provincial Department of Education happened to be in Nanjing to inspect the school and were residing in the Second Academy, so they reported the situation to the provincial supervisors and telegraphed the Department of Education. They also separately reported to the Ninth Police Precinct and requested the Jiangning District Court to send personnel to conduct an autopsy.</p>

<h3 id="e235">How Should Students Practice the New Life Movement? <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Zhen</p>
<p>"New Life, New Life!" What a fashionable slogan. The purpose of the New Life Movement is: to build the nation and revive the people! To improve the knowledge and morality of the people! To enable the general public to have neat, clean, simple, and plain clothing, food, housing, and transportation. To conform to the virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame! It can be seen that the purpose of the New Life Movement is so significant! So important!</p>
<p>We students are the masters of the future nation, and the responsibility of saving the country rests on our shoulders. We are the vanguard of practicing the New Life Movement, so we should understand how to practice the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>The most important points are roughly the following two:</p>
<p>(1) Rules: We must abide by the rules as human beings, so there is also a rule in the rules of the New Life Movement. When you meet someone in the morning, you should say "Good morning." When you say goodbye, say "Goodbye." As the saying goes, "Greeting people doesn't cost anything, just a roll of the tongue." When eating, do not have rash movements. Walk on the left side. There are many rules, too numerous to list.</p>
<p>(2) Cleanliness: Cleanliness is the key to longevity, so there is also cleanliness in the articles of the New Life Movement. Clothes should be washed often, windows should be opened often, nails should be cut often, and hair should be combed often.</p>
<p>I think someone will definitely say, "There are so many rules, and it is so difficult and troublesome to implement them one by one." In fact, what is so difficult about this? Why be afraid of trouble? As long as you practice one or two items every day, you will be practicing the New Life Movement in less than one or two months.</p>
<p>Little friends, I think you really must not be afraid of difficulties and troubles.</p>
<h3 id="e236">The Story of May <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Ding He</p>
<p>One night in May, when Yingdi and Lanmei were fighting for a piece of cake, Dad came back from outside. When they saw Dad, they dropped the cake and went up to call him.</p>
<p>Dad just smiled at them and sat down on a chair next to him. Then, he called them to sit beside him and called me to sit beside him.</p>
<p>Dad first asked his brother what month it was now.</p>
<p>Yingdi quickly said "May". Dad asked Lanmei again, and Lanmei also quickly said "May". Dad asked me again.</p>
<p>"May is May, but we should call it National Humiliation Month."</p>
<p>After I finished speaking, Dad nodded and said, "That's right." But Yingdi and Lanmei were surprised. At this time, Dad sighed and said:</p>
<p>"Just remembering, not thinking about avenging humiliation, is no longer what we should do. Not only do you not think about avenging humiliation, but you don't even remember."</p>
<p>So Yingdi and Lanmei cried. At this time, Dad laughed again and told them the story of May in detail from beginning to end.</p>
<p>After Dad finished telling the story of May, Yingdi said, "We want to unite the children of China, stand up together to avenge humiliation, stand up together to avenge humiliation."</p>
<h3 id="e237">Sibling Rivalry <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Yunwu</p>
<p>One day, the hands and feet were arguing about which was more noble and which was more lowly. The hand scolded the foot and said, "There is nothing more lowly than your 'foot' in the world. Why is that? First, your soles are always treading on the ground and never see the light of day. Second, if your face 'foot' is lifted up for people to see, people will scold you for not knowing respect." The foot laughed and said, "When I am dirty, isn't it your 'hand' that washes my feet? If you want to pick something up, can you get it if I refuse to move?" The hand was questioned by the foot and was rendered speechless. The foot then said, "There is no distinction between noble and lowly in the world. Each has its own use. We must help each other to be effective."</p>
<h3 id="e238">Animal Feet <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>Little friends! It is very interesting to study various animals, big and small. Just from their 'feet,' they are already in all shapes and colors, very interesting.</p>
<p>Land animals all have feet. The feet of aquatic animals are turned into fins. Some have webs on their feet. Why is this? Because animals that walk on land need feet to walk, and animals in the water need fins or webs to swim. This is all because they are adapting to the environment.</p>
<p>The feet of fierce beasts have claws for tearing and devouring other animals. The soles of their feet have thick flesh, so they make no sound when they walk and do not get hurt when they jump. The feet of carnivores such as tigers, leopards, cats, and lions are all like this. Clumsy beasts have hooves on their feet, some with double hooves and some with single hooves. So, hoofed animals are divided into two types: even-toed and odd-toed. Animals such as elephants, cattle, and sheep are hoofed animals.</p>
<p>Birds are flying animals, with feet and claws. Insects all have six legs. Ducks are good at swimming and have webs on their feet; so do frogs. They are like oars for sailing a boat. The pectoral fins and ventral fins of fish are like oars, and the tail fin is like a rudder. It's really interesting.</p>
<p>Snakes, roundworms, pinworms, and tapeworms have no feet and move entirely by wriggling their bodies. The hind legs of frogs and deer are long and their front legs are short, so they jump extremely fast. Crabs have eight legs. Giraffes丨Perhaps this is what the ancients called 'Qilin'丨Their necks are too high and they all walk sideways. The front two legs of birds have turned into wings, so they can fly.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Cuckoo <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>

<p>Cuckoo! Cuckoo!</p>
<p>You crow in the sky.</p>
<p>Telling us that summer has come,</p>
<p>The golden wheat ears are growing,</p>
<p>The old farmer is grateful to you; for driving away pests.</p>
<p>The old farmer is grateful to you; for reminding us to harvest wheat,</p>

<p>— Lin Ruan</p>
<p>Little friends, do you know the great British inventor Stevenson? The train you see was invented by him. He was the son of a coal company stoker. When he was young, he only herded sheep for others. At the age of fourteen, he helped his father with work. But he was secretly reading at the same time. Later, his father died, and the whole family's clothes were all borne by him alone. At that time, he also lost his wife, and his sadness cannot be described.</p>
<p>But Stevenson, who was not afraid of difficulties, regardless of whether his ability was sufficient, began to study science. The first time he invented the safety lamp in coal mines, and the second time, he invented the train, a tool of transportation. He publicly demonstrated it on the road from Liverpool to Manchester, and the people who watched cheered and wished him success, but he died in 1848.</p>
<p>Little friends, people who struggle, even if the environment is bad, cannot be stopped.</p>
<h3 id="e241">A Letter to Little Friends in the City <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zongjie</p>
<p>Dear Little Friends:</p>
<p>Your innocence, liveliness, and happiness are so enviable, so I gave up the qualification of an old man 丨丨I am nearly forty years old 丨丨and hang out with you kids all day long, being the oldest little brother.</p>
<p>Little friends! I now live in the countryside, and I can also be called an old little brother in the countryside. What are some of the scenes in the countryside in early summer? What do we play? Let me report some to you.</p>
<p>The rice seedlings in the field are already two inches long, planted in rows and columns. The rapeseed flowers have already formed seeds, the peas have also formed fruit. A kind of small bird is calling, "Plant quickly! Plant quickly!" The strong young men in the village have begun to bare their legs, roll up their sleeves, and go down to the fields to work.</p>
<p>My little friends and I get up together at 5:00 in the morning, walking and jumping on the banks of the fields. There is some dew on the grass, and the eastern sun is beginning to show its crimson face. We look at the rice seedlings in the field, look at the tadpoles in the stream, and listen to the birds singing on the branches. After walking like this for an hour, we each go home to have breakfast, go to school, and do work.</p>
<p>Dusk is our happiest time. A large, soft, green lawn is our playground and natural chair. Many little friends are kicking balls on it, or racing and high jumping. We pick many wildflowers and braid them into crowns to give to the winners. When we are tired of playing, we lie on it, telling stories and singing folk songs, until the sun sinks in the west, and Mr. Toad, who shouts slogans, dismisses the meeting, and we each go home.</p>
<p>Little friends! How do you feel about these simple reports? Would you like to try this country life? I welcome you to join us, I wish you happiness. Your old little brother Xu Zongjie, greetings.</p>
<h3 id="e242">What Does the Earth Look Like? <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Han Yu</p>
<p>Little friends! Do you know what the Earth looks like?</p>
<p>The shape of the Earth is a sphere. To be more precise, its shape is like an orange. If little friends don’t believe the Earth is round, you can go to the seaside and look at a ship coming from afar. First, we see the ship's smokestack, and only later can we see the body of the ship. If you think the Earth is flat, we should see the body and the smokestack together. How can this phenomenon occur?</p>
<p>During a lunar eclipse, we can see a round shadow on the moon. This shadow is the Earth's shadow reflected onto the moon. The dark shadow is round, so of course, the Earth is also round.</p>
<p>Little friends may ask, "The Earth is round and constantly moving. Why don't we feel it at all?" You can catch an ant and put it on a ball, and quickly spin the ball. But the ant can still walk forward without feeling anything. This is because the ball is too big, and the ant is too small. We are like many ants, and the Earth is a huge ball.</p>
<h3 id="e243">About Grabbing Thirty <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Huai</p>
<p>Little friends! Last time, this publication featured the "Grabbing Thirty" mini-game. You must have played it already. I want to ask you, what experiences did you gain after playing?</p>
<p>Little friends! I will now write down the experience of "Grabbing Thirty" here. Do you want to know?</p>
<p>Step 1: Within ten, grab three, six, nine.</p>
<p>Step 2: Above ten, within twenty, grab two, five, eight.</p>
<p>Step 3: Above twenty, within thirty, grab one, four, seven.</p>
<p>With this method of grabbing, you are guaranteed to get thirty. If you don't believe it, try it!</p>
<h3 id="e244">Sending Eggs 丨Sensory Game丨 <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Whether a child's sense of feeling is acute or not is significantly related to innate physiology, but postnatal behavioral training is also very important. If a naturally dull and insensitive child is given proper training, although they cannot catch up with a gifted child, they can at least surpass children who have not received sensory training. The best training method is through games. This "Sending Eggs" game is one of the methods to train children's sensory acuity.</p>
<p>There is no limit to the number of people playing the game, but too few will reduce interest, and too many will make guessing difficult, so the most appropriate number is five to ten people. The location of the game is not limited; it can be indoors or outdoors. Before starting, first select one person to be the "egg sender" and one person to be the "guesser." The remaining people stand with their hands behind their backs, leaning against a wall. The guesser closes their eyes tightly and stands about ten steps away from the people leaning against the wall. The egg sender prepares a small rubber ball or a pebble to represent the egg. They can sing, "Chicken Mama is sending eggs, who wants them? Who wants them?" While giving the egg to any child, they then say, "It's sent! Guess who got it, and I'll give it to you to eat!" The guesser then walks closer to the children standing against the wall, observes their expressions, and guesses who received the egg. If they guess correctly, the person who received the egg and the guesser switch roles. If they guess incorrectly, they try again. If they guess incorrectly three times, they are penalized by singing a song or telling a story. The egg sender can switch or give away the egg multiple times before finally giving it to someone. The children who received the egg or did not receive the egg can deliberately make peculiar expressions to make it difficult for the guesser to observe.</p>

<p>— Da Qi</p>
<p>A magpie's call brings good news, and a crow's caw brings misfortune. This is a superstition. Magpies and crows are birds. How can they know a person's fortune? However, some people know that it is not credible, but when they hear a magpie calling, they can't help but feel happy; when they hear a crow cawing, they can't help but feel disgusted. In fact, crows know how to feed their parents, they are filial birds, and not something very bad. But people always curse them whenever they open their mouths, it's really unfair to them. However, the crow's caw, "wa wa wa," carries a sorrowful sound, causing people to feel unhappy and somewhat dislike listening to it. If the crow is ignorant of this and nods its head at people, cawing constantly, they will pick up stones and throw them to drive it away. Isn't this what we often see? Although a magpie's call is not particularly good, it is relatively energetic and pleasant to listen to, so it is okay if it calls a little. There is no harm if it calls a lot. It is always welcomed everywhere.</p>
<p>Little friends, from the above, we can see that people's speech must also be appropriate. Compositions have grammar, writing characters has character rules, painting has painting methods, how can speaking not have methods? In ancient times, elementary schools had "rules for responding," which studied speech. Sage's schools had a "speech subject," which also emphasized speech. If speech is not done properly, no matter how good your knowledge and character are, you will easily provoke resentment and jealousy whenever you speak, and you will encounter obstacles everywhere, just like a crow, making people disgusted when it opens its mouth. How can you gain a foothold in society?</p>

Umbrellas spread from the above two places to Greece and Rome, but they became tools for shielding from the sun. However, in Eastern countries, even now, umbrellas are still regarded as a symbol of authority, such as in Siam, Malaya, and places like Ashanti and Abyssinia in Africa. In ancient China, umbrellas also contained a solemn and noble meaning. But in modern times, they are only used as tools for sheltering from rain and sun, or as decorations for women. In Japan, the situation is the same as in China.</p>

<h3 id="e250">Regarding Daycares and Public Childcare <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Jiu</p>
<p>Since the news of establishing "daycares" in Shanghai, it has attracted general attention. In the supplement to this newspaper on May 13th, there was an article by Mr. Shi Shi, "Regarding Daycares and Public Childcare." It was against daycares, and the general idea was: "Although public childcare in European and American countries has been implemented and achieved results, given the current social conditions, national economy, cultural level, and family concepts in our country, it is believed that there are still doubts about promoting public childcare." The reasons for opposing it are roughly based on two points: (1) Opposing women engaging in occupations and neglecting childcare. (2) Suspecting public childcare itself.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, Mr. Shi Shi said: "The current engagement of ordinary Chinese women in occupations is actually just selling short-term youth... After marriage, society cannot reserve considerable positions for mothers with children, then daycares naturally lose their necessity of existence. Moreover, women have the natural duty of raising children. Raising children to make them physically and mentally healthy is serving society, and its value is greater than being a vase in an organization or a living signboard in a commercial market." The need for women to engage in occupations, even if we abandon ideological theories, just talking about the current situation in China, due to years of imperialist aggression, the brink of internal strife, rural bankruptcy, and market depression, middle- and lower-class housewives have had no choice but to seek occupations to make a living. Among women from middle- and upper-class families, they have had the opportunity to receive education. Once they have knowledge and skills, they will naturally want to develop their instincts and engage in politics, academics, or other occupations to do what they can. Therefore, women's engagement in occupations is an inevitable phenomenon in the current society. Since there are working women on one hand, there is a need for childcare institutions on the other hand. One side can concentrate on work, and the other side can provide high-quality education. Those who like to work can work, and those who like to educate children can educate children. It can be said to be a division of labor for individuals and cooperation for society. As for the so-called engaging in occupations is just selling short-term youth, it is indeed a derogatory term for working women. But we cannot deny that many working women do give up their occupations after marriage or can no longer engage in occupations. The former is caused by the phenomenon of a society with too few opportunities. The reasons for the latter are varied, but it is also due to the lack of childcare institutions.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, Mr. Shi Shi believes that public childcare will destroy family bonds, so he says: "Children and families have an inseparable relationship. Children are the center of family happiness... Having children and grandchildren around the knees constitutes family harmony... Family is also a paradise for children. Parental love is the only nourishment for children's lives, otherwise, it is difficult to survive." Mr. Shi Shi is still dreaming of that kind of feudalistic peaceful paradise of having children and grandchildren around the knees. In fact, in the current society where life is busy and making a living is not easy, it is impossible for middle- and lower-class families to enjoy this leisurely family harmony. Moreover, daycares are different from China's inherent orphanages. Children raised in daycares still have to go home on time to reunite with their parents. As for whether the family is a paradise for children, it is questionable. The fact is that ordinary Chinese families are a hell for children. The rich do not know how to teach or raise them, only knowing how to spoil them; the poor cannot even talk about raising them. Moreover, Chinese children are accustomed to family life and lack group cultivation. The habit of being like scattered sand is half formed by family life. As for parental love, it is indeed the spiritual nourishment for children, but doting love and selfish love—parents see children as playthings and private property—loving them appropriately harms them, not only harming the children themselves but also causing harm to society. The high mortality rate of Chinese children is unparalleled. The reasons are varied, but it is also due to the inability to teach, the inability to raise them, and the result of hunger and cold. In this situation, there is a need for public and more scientific methods of education.</p>
<p>Regarding the charging of fees, according to the general practice in advanced countries, it is mostly proportional to the income of the young children's parents and is not related to the number of children.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Shi said at the end: "In fact, it only provides a convenient door for frivolous playboys to indulge in pleasure, and the result may become the final destination for illegitimate children and adulterous children." In recent years, the rampant spread of human desires has been a well-known fact. Then the proliferation of illegitimate children and adulterous children may be an inevitable phenomenon. This bad phenomenon is a social illness. Illegitimate children or adulterous children are inherently innocent. Moreover, the Chinese nation used to have 400 million people, but now it may be less than that number. For the sake of reviving the nation, I believe that whether they are illegitimate children or legitimate children, it is necessary to find ways to make them grow up healthy. Therefore, I am glad that Shanghai will soon have daycares. I hope that more and more daycares will be established in cities and towns. However, I hope that those who run daycares will strive for scientific methods, avoid being aristocratic, and make it more convenient for poor children.</p>

<p>Seven Owen</p>
<p>Owen (Robert Owen) was a great British utopian socialist, born in 1771 and died in 1858. At this time, the progress of technology in British production had turned a large number of skilled craftsmen into appendages of machines or completely excluded from production and replaced by unskilled weak women and children, which was the period of "rampant evil" of capitalism. Whole batches of young children died from being cruelly exploited in factories. Owen was born in this era and witnessed all kinds of tragedies, which made him transform from a great industrialist and humanitarian into a thorough social reformer.</p>
<p>The scope of his social reform was very broad, including protecting children, running education, setting up schools, establishing daycares, protecting factory labor, opening hospitals, and providing relief to the elderly and the unemployed. In order to realize his ideals, Owen attempted to establish a communist commune to replace the old and dying system. But he did not understand that the economic liberation of workers and escape from slavery must be the matter of the workers themselves. Owen believed that the "wise and far-sighted people" of all parties could jointly achieve the necessary reforms.</p>
<p>When Owen was ten years old, his father ordered him to be an apprentice in a rural shop. Later, he worked in the two major cities of London and Manchester for several years. In 1790, Owen, at the age of nineteen, became the manager of a large spinning mill in Manchester (which was then the center of the British textile industry). Seven years later, he joined with friends and bought a spinning mill in New Lanark, Scotland, for 1.25 million marks, with three thousand male and female workers and children. This factory became the testing ground for his social reform plan.</p>
<p>Owen's first task was to pay attention to children. He set up many daycares to reduce the burden of female workers with children. He abolished the method of rewarding and punishing children in the schools he ran; his factory also did not hire children under the age of ten to work: those over the age of ten were required to work for twelve and a half hours, which was a huge progress at the time, because even a four-year-old child had to work in the factory for twelve to sixteen hours.</p>
<p>In 1825, in order to realize his ideal of a new social system, Owen purchased a piece of land in Indiana, USA, and established a communist community called "New Harmony." Owen had many outstanding male and female comrades here, among whom a Ms. Bright played a particularly important role in the women's movement. She personally established a small group within "New Harmony." After the failure of the "New Harmony" experiment, Ms. Bright continued to fight for many years to fight for women's equality.</p>
<p>Owen believed that women are born equal to men and have no obligation to obey men. He also bravely implemented his beliefs in life, although this caused violent attacks on him by society, he was still unyielding. In "New Harmony," women enjoyed the right to vote and to be elected. In the "Young America" magazine run by his son, he published his twelve demands, one of which was "men and women should be completely equal."</p>
<p>Owen deeply believed in the power of mankind's highest ideals. He attempted to create a new, more perfect, and collective social life system as an example to resist the brutal exploitation of the time. In all aspects, he revealed a wealth of ideas, which were the object of ridicule and sarcasm at the time, but are now the treasures of international socialism.</p>
<p>As for Owen's opinions on marriage, prostitution, women's occupations, and children's education, let's talk about them next time.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Meticulous Charm Movement and Women's Liberation <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Jiong</p>
<p>A meticulous charm movement has recently been advocated in Cleveland, USA.</p>
<p>It is said that the rise of this meticulous charm movement is based on pleasing men. Because men feel that: a woman with makeup is simply a vase, without a soul, only for people to play with. This not only fails to show a lively posture but also has adverse effects on health: how can it be called "a gentleman's good match"? Therefore, they stood on the position of pleasing men and found: (1) Because the number of women with tuberculosis is increasing, it is not easy to prevent disease and prolong life without advocating the meticulous charm movement. (2) Developing meticulous charm is also an opportunity for women to exercise their bodies, making their bodies healthier day by day, and diseases cannot invade. (3) Women decorating their faces with powder is not considered beautiful. They must have a charming posture to be fully beautiful. (4) They must work hard on meticulous charm, and then they can be pursued by men everywhere. These are the reasons for launching the meticulous charm movement: holding lectures everywhere, posting slogans, and even each women's group has an affiliated meticulous charm training school, educating them to charm men, to charm their lovers, to charm their husbands, as well as narrative charm, love charm, greeting charm, farewell charm, walking charm, etc., so that they become experts in pleasing men. Can it be said that this can be beneficial to the women's liberation movement?</p>
<p>We know that the reason why women are in an oppressed position is due to social systems and economic conditions. We can understand the ins and outs of this as long as we turn over the history of social evolution and the history of women's liberation movement. But the ladies of America are turning a new trick after getting tired of the taste of powder: they fully believe that working hard on meticulous charm, being pursued by men everywhere, showing their health and arrogance, is liberation (?!) This is simply a self-deceiving joke!</p>
<p>If we think that things from the West are always "modern" and learn this meticulous charm, then our 200 million women under double oppression will not only disarm themselves but also cancel the camp of fighting for liberation. Because this meticulous charm movement presents us with a posture of pleasing men. It is a huge stone blocking the path of the women's liberation movement. It is a cup of anesthetic soup. Therefore, we should resolutely block the invasion of this meticulous charm movement and strengthen our women's movement front, and strive to fight from the economic and political aspects, and then we can obtain true liberation!</p>
<h3 id="e253">Do You Believe It? Twins Can Actually Have Two Fathers <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Not long ago, a strange case of twins being able to have two fathers occurred in South Dakota (S·Dakota) in the United States, causing a sensation in society, and the local court made a new precedent that had never been seen in the world for this matter. Readers, do you believe it? This is indeed true, because in Pullman Village in that state, there was a farmer named Yadwa Babad, who had two identical twins, one of whom looked very much like Babad, while the other did not look like Babad at all. So Babad was very suspicious. Because his wife had been having an affair with someone else, Babad obtained evidence, and then the dispute began. Babad said: He can only fulfill his father's obligation to his own child (that is, the one who looks like him). As for the other one, it is definitely not his child and can only be the responsibility of the mother. As a result, the couple quarreled in the state court. Naturally, Babad's reasons were very sufficient. After several interrogations by the court, Judge Duriber finally ruled in favor of Babad's request, and the couple were to be responsible for the support of the two children separately. In this way, can't twins really have two fathers?</p>
<h3 id="e254">Echoes of "A Woman's Heart" <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Jue</p>
<p>"You are wrong!"</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>In the tenth issue of Women's World, your tragic history was published. At the end, you said, "Who is willing to tell me 'You are right' or 'You are wrong'?" According to my shallow knowledge to "criticize" (?), I can confidently say: "You are wrong!"</p>
<p>Please don't doubt that I am speaking against my conscience. I am defending my own gender.</p>
<p>First: I feel that when you are just starting to fall in love, you should naturally use all your abilities to observe your object. Aren't newspapers and magazines full of news about marriage deception now? Can you suddenly believe that your object will not be the protagonist in those news stories? Looking closely at your "A Woman's Heart," you don't seem to have noticed this.</p>
<p>Second: Since you knew that not long before you fell in love, he had been passionately in love with another woman; you should have explored why he broke up with his first lover and how he broke up with his first lover. Of course, he will use deceptive and improper means to break away from you, and his means of breaking away from his first lover must also be nothing more than deception or other improper methods. But according to you, you only know "It is said that she refused to agree to his request, and then they broke up."</p>
<p>He will break up with his first lover because she did not agree to his request. Can you guarantee that he will not break up with you because you do not agree to his request to love another woman?</p>
<p>Third: Since your friend warned you, "Can you believe that he will not fall in love with a third woman?" Why did you suddenly believe him? He will smash the precious lute that his teacher gave him, which shows that he is a guy who is good at forgetting friends. Those who write blood letters are often the most weak-willed people. People who use death to threaten others are the worst scum of mankind. You cannot be moved by his blood letter; you cannot abandon your doubts and hesitation for his "death." Death! Don't you know that many compatriots in the Northeast were brutally killed by the violent Japanese? Don't you know that many compatriots in the Northwest were drowned and starved to death by natural disasters? Don't you know that many round-headed and square-footed civilians were shot to death by military men? What is so great about the death of a person who would smash the precious lute that his teacher gave him and use it to deceive the love of the opposite sex!</p>
<p>Also fourth: You cannot hate your heart for not being "ruthless" and not being "poisonous." Your failure is not because your heart is not "ruthless" and not being "poisonous," but because your brain lacks rationality! Your heart is too easily moved.</p>
<p>With these four points, I dare to say that you are wrong. However, sir, you are a Hunanese, and Hunanese and Cantonese are the bravest, most enterprising, most revolutionary, and most hopeful people in our country. I respectfully wish you to use the blood of my Hunanese people to break through the obscurity of your future!</p>

<p>— Meng Kai</p>
<p>I am not one who resides in the school dormitory. Therefore, I wouldn't know about the novelties of the "East Palace" and "West Palace." This is merely about my everyday after-school activities.</p>
<p>We rarely have the chance to chat idly because, once the dismissal bell rings, everyone is busy packing their bags to go home. So, it is only when there are no classes or when the teacher is absent that...</p>
<p>People's personalities differ, so their actions are obviously quite different: diligent students, holding the motto of "an inch of time is worth an inch of gold," bury themselves in their books, but there are only one or two like that in the entire grade. Some active students happily skip rope and play basketball on the playground, fully expressing their liveliness and innocence. Students who are obsessed with movies and Cantonese opera gather to chat: "What? The movie premiering today is XX film, starring the newly chosen queen... It's a pity I don't have a chance to see it... That star is so pretty and charming. Chen Fei-nong's performance is just right... Chen Zhao-hong is so beautiful... Liang Shao-ping is so fat... The male cast's performance last night was great, a must-see!" They often talk like this with great interest, chattering away. Students who like to dress up always talk about the new fashions of 1934 and how to dress... "Today, to the Guanghan Palace, the Great Light..." "Electric wave... lover... stroll in the park..." There are many more, I can't remember them all. Some students with literary interests often play the old tune of the grayness of life... As for me, I don't talk much, and there's nothing to talk about. When I encounter such scenes, I just silently listen to their idle chatter, or take the opportunity to observe their personalities. So, I often sigh like this: "Alas! Today's female students are mostly immersed in dreams, besides food, clothing, shelter, reading, and entertainment. What do social affairs have to do with them?"</p>
<h3 id="e256">Smoke Screen <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>Youth, delicacy, and laughter.</p>
<p>All these are concealed behind a hollow and heavy curtain. Behind the curtain lurks a fierce and man-eating wolf, and the curtain-pullers are some foolish lackeys.</p>
<p>Opening their insatiable blood-bowls and waiting for the students' $, imparting some smoke-bomb knowledge and flattering skills, telling you to say one, and you can't say two, telling you to be calm, and even coughing is superfluous. If you obediently wag your tail, you might see a smile on the tiger's face. If you go crazy and want to take a breath and take a longer step, good:</p>
<p>"Crack!" A whip will lash you, a stern warning.</p>
<p>After the whip-like lecture, they will force you to participate in the provincial sports meet, write memorial essays for the school board, and submit articles for the "××××" essay contest. Why? To please their master. In front of the master, they themselves transform into slaves.</p>
<p>Foreign teachers host guests, and the girls dress up in colorful clothes to be guests. Of course, a few fluent conversational sentences are indispensable, but usually, it is forbidden to run outside, stopping at the triple gate, and you can't leave the school gate more than six times in half a year. The fear is that wandering around will distract you from your studies. On the other hand, they are vigorously advocating for the school to be a home and socialized: inviting parents to admire the spring scenery on campus. Thinking that their daughters and sisters are growing up in this good environment, the parents smile with relief, and there is no lack of praise: a good place to cultivate emotions and character.</p>
<p>It seems that "general customs" have caused the students to establish an autonomous association, approved by the school, supervising the executive committee and the general assembly. The selection of personnel is particularly concerning: those who are quiet and obedient, those who talk too much at meetings are troublemakers, especially "those clever people who still need to sort out the remaining or un-mailed donations."</p>
<p>Learning some waltzes or foxtrots in physical education is in line with the years of dancing to save the country! Twisting their waists, draped in puffy, wave-like hair, and with the pleasant sound of clattering leather shoes, the young women loosely feel the mystery of spring.</p>
<p>Only tricky lessons lock up the students' spring mood: monthly exams, major exams, plus the graduation examination. Cracking it is a must, otherwise the school has the right to deny participation in the graduation examination, fearing that bad grades will affect the school's overall average score. The authorities never forget to win the hearts of their masters.</p>
<p>Graduation is not easy. It is necessary to send 500 to 1,000 worth of souvenirs to the school, raise donations, but the girls frown. Everyone knows that the economic recession has affected families, and most families have been hit by this.</p>
<p>Thinking blankly, feeling resentful:</p>
<p>"This world is a mystery, when will the fighting end?"</p>
<p>Few can understand the causes and consequences of this contradiction and terror. It is just that the sheep are really suffering from tremor, and this disease is spreading.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Letters to the Editor <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>(1) To the esteemed editor: I have read the article "Our School" in the women's section of your newspaper on May 13th, which stated that the school prohibits reading "The Education of Love" and inspects hymens, and generally refers to the authorities' oppression of students. The editor's note at the end of the article declares that the article was submitted by a student from Qingdao Municipal Girls' Middle School, and the author claims responsibility. However, it is doubtful whether the content is fabricated, and we ask the local educational administrators to pay attention, which shows that your newspaper is concerned about women's education. However, the article is not a faithful record, and its attack on the school authorities is very obvious, especially the two sections that prohibit reading "The Education of Love" and inspect hymens, which are completely untrue. Now, I would like to inform the editor of your newspaper of the actual situation investigated by our bureau. This school pays great attention to the physical and mental education of students. Therefore, the school stipulates that teachers and staff should examine students' self-study reading materials at any time, and advise students not to read any books that are not suitable for the physical and mental cultivation of young people. As for the book "The Education of Love," it was originally on display in the school library, so how could it be prohibited from reading? Regarding physical examinations, as the editor said, the school regards it as one of the ways to promote students' health. Therefore, there are two types of examinations: disease examinations and physical examinations. The former is purely for the purpose of examining diseases and is carried out by the school doctor. The latter is mostly for the development of the body and is examined by physical education teachers and staff of the training office. This time, the physical examination was carried out by three female teachers, namely to examine whether the students' bodies were developing normally and whether their clothes and dresses were harmful to hygiene, and there was absolutely no inspection of the hymen. More than 300 students underwent the examination, and there was no coercion. The claims in the article are an exaggeration and sensationalization of the issue, and are probably not the work of the school's students. However, since the submission claims to be responsible for the content, your newspaper should (omission) make a factual correction to clarify the truth, and we look forward to your reply. This is addressed to the Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper, Qingdao Municipal Education Bureau, May 18th.</p>
<p>(2) To the esteemed editor: I have recently read the article "My School" published in the women's section of your newspaper on May 13th, which contains many defamatory and slanderous statements about our school, and claims that it was submitted by a student from our school, which is very shocking. Disease examinations are a routine event for our school every semester. This semester, on March 5th (Health Week), in addition to inviting Dr. Jiao, a school doctor, to give a lecture on "Health Issues" during Memorial Week, the disease examination began in the afternoon after class. It was carried out by the school doctor, with the assistance of nurses from the Municipal Hospital and staff from the training office. The examination included the ears, eyes, teeth, throat, and heart and lungs to check for diseases, and each item was entered into the disease examination form. The intention was to implement effective treatment or prevention based on the examination results to improve the health of the students. On March 7th, a physical examination was also held, which was carried out by a female physical education teacher, with the assistance of staff from the training office and a female English teacher. The examination included the posture of the head, shoulders, back, spine, abdomen, and feet, as well as the grip strength, and each item was entered into the physical examination form in order to implement appropriate corrections to achieve correct posture. This work was completed within three weeks. As for the "inspection of the hymen," not only has the gentleman "never heard of it before,"</p>
<p>Our school has never even thought of it, let alone implemented it! Other sections such as prohibiting the reading of "The Education of Love" are absurd and ridiculous, and there is no need to explain them. Rumors stop with the wise. As the gentleman said, "Although it is doubtful whether the content is true, the author claims responsibility, so we will disclose it for now." "The aforementioned situation, if not fabricated," is because the gentleman is also suspicious and cautious in his words! However, rumors confuse the public and concern the reputation of the school, so our school cannot remain silent. I am providing a brief description of the actual situation and asking your publication to disclose a correction (omission). This is addressed to Mr. Han of the Women's Section of the Shenbao Newspaper, Qingdao Municipal Girls' Middle School, May 18th.</p>
<p>Editor's note: The editor of this publication is not surnamed Han, and it is unknown to whom "Mr. Han" refers.</p>

<h3 id="e258">Financial: U.S. Treasury Secretary Decides to Levy Tax on Silver Profits; Local Gold Market Remains Stable; Morning Opening Down One Cent; Afternoon Closing Up One Cent <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>The gold market was extremely stable yesterday, with few transactions in the morning and a slow market. The U.S. Treasury Secretary's decision to levy a tax on silver profits, as well as the speculator Mr. Wu's continued buying interest, strongly supported gold prices. The foreign exchange market was still good, resulting in a slight increase compared to the previous day. In the early morning, overseas silver markets were flat in England and up in the United States. The forward silver price on the Gold and Metals Exchange was nearly flat but slightly up. Exchange rates did not fluctuate much. London spot gold fell two and a half pence, U.S. cotton rose seven pounds, and U.S. wheat rose three-eighths of a cent, which seemed to indicate a lower opening. However, a United Press dispatch stated that U.S. government leaders today asked the House Ways and Means Committee to quickly pass the President's silver bill, and a Treasury Department advisor declared that, according to the bill, silver prices would definitely increase. However, the Treasury Secretary resolutely demanded that the 50% tax on silver profits be retained. Although lacking a huge impact, it stabilized people's minds. A Reuters dispatch also had the U.S. Treasury Secretary describe the administration's desire to retain the silver tax provision. The market opened flat and then slightly higher. After opening, prices rose due to banks' appetite, but the supply was abundant. The foreign exchange market was slightly erratic. The HSBC price announcement revealed that both the British and American exchange rates were flat. Afterwards, the market stabilized, with much wavering, low but still able to recover, because speculator Mr. Wu continued to buy. However, the fluctuations were extremely narrow. Later, the silver price in the Seattle night market did not move, shrinking 1/8 of a cent, which was in a winding situation and had little impact. Afterwards, the domestic market slightly loosened, and large households slightly sold, once weaker, but banks took advantage of the cheapness to continue buying, and the domestic market loosened and then tightened again, and the gold price became firm again. The market in the morning was mediocre, with the red gold price at 1029 yuan and 6 jiao, and the swap discount at one yuan. The morning market situation will be recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1016 yuan and 6 jiao, a slight drop of one cent compared to the previous closing. Spot opened at 6 yuan and 5 jiao. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price, British exchange at one shilling and three and a half pence, American exchange at 32 yuan and 875. Zhengjin and Maijiali bought September U.S. dollars at 31/8 cents. Wupin and Yongde bought strips, rising to 7 yuan and 5 jiao. Tongchun, Dadecheng, and Shengda sold strips, falling to 5 yuan and 3 jiao. Daxingyong, Huixiang, and Hengxing, etc., took strips, speculator Mr. Wu bought in, and then rose to 6 yuan and 4 jiao. Dadecheng and Yuqingyong sold off, falling to 5 yuan and 6 jiao. Hengchangyong and Fuxingyong still bought. The HSBC price announcement remained unchanged. At this time, the situation was winding, and then rose to 6 yuan and 7 jiao. Hengyu came to sell, dropping to 5 yuan and a half, because September U.S. dollars were at 31/8 cents, and the banks' appetite varied. Daxingyong still bought strips, and Qianheng also bought, still rising to 6 yuan and 6 jiao. Fuan and Hengtai supplied strips, and the trend was mostly sideways. When Yifengyong sold tirelessly, and Yuanshengyong also sold, it fell to 4 yuan and 6 jiao. Chengkangyong, Hengyu, and Daxingyong took advantage of the low price to buy in, September U.S. dollars at 33/4 cents, and the banks still had buying interest, gradually rising. Finally, Huabi, Maijiali, and Chaoxian all ate September U.S. dollars at 31/8 cents, Zhengchang bought vigorously and rose, and the afternoon closing rose to 1016 yuan and 8 jiao, and the spot was at 7 yuan and 2 jiao. After the closing, Zhengchang, Huixiang, Fuyu, etc., all bought, and rose to 7 yuan and 5 jiao. The highest price in the morning was 1017 yuan and a half, and the lowest price was 1014 yuan and 6 jiao, a fluctuation of 2 yuan and 9 jiao. The result was a slight increase of one cent compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The closing price was based on the HSBC bank's U.S. dollar listing price, which remained unchanged at 32 yuan and 375 cents, and the standard gold price was weakly at 1069 yuan, which, according to the closing price, was about 52 yuan, with little difference from the previous closing. The registered price for June was 1018 yuan, and for July it was 1017 yuan. The morning water supplement was 1018 yuan. The red gold price was 1029 yuan and 6 jiao. The spot red gold market was quiet, and there were no formal transactions. The Tianjin gang did not settle because the Shanghai price was not suitable. The Central Bank did not act yesterday, because the gold bar price was cheap, and the standard gold price did not fall, so it was difficult to trade. The swap was only done by Qianchangxiang, who posted 60-70 strips to Hengyu, only two yuan. 3,360 June strips were still left. Long positions included Hengyu with over 900 strips, Dadecheng with 770 strips, Qianchangxiang with over 500 strips, Huiyuan with over 200 strips, Qingfayong with less than 200, Yuanheng, Chunyuan Yong, Fuxingyong, and Yingfengheng each with over 100, and the rest were scattered.

The term selling price was one shilling and three and a half pence for the British exchange rate, and 32 yuan and 875 cents for the American exchange rate, which was the same for both the British and American rates as the previous closing. After the opening, the banks' appetite was quite good and tight. The HSBC price announcement revealed that there was no change in either the British or American exchange rates. After this, the situation was extremely flat. However, the September U.S. dollar at 33 yuan and 31/8 cents had varying appetites among the banks and showed a slight loosening. Finally, although it once became hard, it was entirely due to the influence of the gold market, and it soon recovered. At noon, the banks' appetite was still healthy and tight. The trend was still tight. At the noon closing, the near-term selling price was one shilling and three and a half pence for the British exchange rate, and 32 yuan and 875 cents for the American exchange rate, with little change from the previous closing.

<p>Yesterday, the financial market situation was even more sluggish than the previous day, and it was truly a case of things getting worse and worse. Various transactions felt tired. The foreign call loan price was six points in both the morning and afternoon markets, a decrease of one point compared to the previous day.

<h3 id="e261">The Bond Market Was Abnormally Quiet Before the Securities Settlement <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures for May at the Chinese Securities Exchange had already stopped, and the market only traded futures for June for one month. The atmosphere in the market was unusually idle. On the one hand, only the near month was being traded, and on the other hand, it was Saturday, and people's minds were even more relaxed. The environment also had no news to speak of. The morning floor was extremely quiet. The biggest drop was 3 jiao and a half for the Demobilization Bond, because the Demobilization Bond has always had a very strong short squeeze, and it has turned into a long squeeze in the last two months, indicating that the long positions are crowded, which is the opposite of before, so with so many floating longs, the shorts feel stable. The other bonds, such as the Compilation and Inheritance Bond, the 1920 Customs Bond, and the 20 Customs Bond, were not traded, and the market price was also slightly weak. The second session was even rarer, with six types not being traded. The entire trading session lasted only more than ten minutes. Of the fourteen types of bonds, only twelve were traded, which was unprecedentedly quiet. In the afternoon, the long side used the quiet market to push up prices, and trading increased slightly. The market price tended to be firm, rising by two to three jiao, and closing up by about one jiao. These were not formal market prices. The result was slightly better, ranging from 5 cents to 3 jiao and a half. The Demobilization Bond and the 20 Customs Bond were slightly smaller by 5 cents and 1 jiao. The total number of transactions was only 2,215,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e262">New York Stock Market Was Driven High by Wheat <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that yesterday (the 25th), the stock market was driven high by wheat because it was predicted that the weather would remain droughty within 24 hours, and news came that wheat in South Dakota had suffered a loss of 200 million yuan due to drought, so wheat prices soared immediately. At the same time, there were rumors that President Luo was about to issue a statement that would be beneficial to the long side, so the stock market also rose. The Federal Reserve report stated that gold reserves increased by 50 million yuan this week, reversing the previous three-trend trend. Some Wall Street people firmly believe that before the United States restores the gold standard, gold standard countries will refuse President Luo's silver plan to conduct further trials. The small exchange market situation and bonds were mixed. According to agent reports, the securities market was mixed in the early morning, and then developed considerable strength, closing firm. The drought has not diminished in the wheat market, and high prices are imminent. The weather in Canada and the northwestern United States has not changed, and there is no relief in sight in the short term. Some authorities point out the possibility of inflation in cotton and generally underestimate the significance of the government's silver plan, and with the progress of various markets, the cotton market is also firm. Factory purchases this week totaled 189,000 bales. The urgent sales of rubber seem to have ended, and peers and brokers are buying, with few foreign sales. The silver market is calm, and speculators continue to reluctantly settle. The total transaction volume for the day was 540,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rebounded, but the overall trend has slightly softened. This is due to some long position holders taking profits, which has eased the market. At the same time, the actual demand is clearer than before. However, procurement from Guangdong and inland merchants continues uninterrupted, so the long positions still have no intention of unloading. As the cotton market remains strong, the yarn market is unlikely to decline.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Standard Yarn Falls Back 90 Cents <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>

<p>The cotton market fell in the morning but rose in the afternoon, showing a trend opposite to the yarn market. Therefore, the overall trend remains strong, and buyers are still active on dips. However, the delivery volume exceeded 50,000 dan, with the receivers being mostly long position companies and certain banks, and fewer factories.</p>

<p>New York, 25th, reports on the cotton market of the week, saying that the development of the silver bureau situation last week has greatly disappointed the inflationists. The cotton market loosened due to long liquidations, scattered selling, and favorable progress of new cotton. At the same time, the spot market was sluggish, and the gold standard was stable. However, it later rebounded slightly due to short covering. There is a lack of pressure in the South, but trading has also decreased, so market fluctuations are very narrow. The germination of new cotton in the East is slightly poor, but other progress is generally good. It is understood that 90% to 95% of the new cotton has been planted, but cotton field opinions cannot be realized until the end of June. It is necessary to wait for the planting farmers to fully decide on the distribution of the彭海氏案. Currently, market prices are hovering between firm spot positions, good new cotton, and poor cotton conditions.</p>

<h3 id="e273">Wheat Prices Unlikely to Rise Before the New Grain Harvest <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market was generally flat, with foreign wheat quotations rising by 90 cents to 1 yuan. However, market sentiment seems to have paid little attention to foreign wheat quotations, as domestic new wheat is reported to be very abundant in both Jiangnan and Jiangbei. Even Henan and Shaanxi provinces are expected to have bumper harvests. Moreover, foreign wheat and old wheat are naturally sufficient before the new harvest, and there is little need for whole batches in the one or two months after the new harvest. With market sentiment cleared, price increases are naturally difficult. As a result, the July and August contracts were unchanged, and the September contract was slightly down by 1 cent. Spot wheat demand was very low as factories had foreign wheat for blending, so no transactions were seen.</p>
<h3 id="e274">Flour Market Remains Sluggish <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market presented a winding and weak picture after the opening in the morning. Foreign wheat quotations, Chicago rose by 90 cents to 1 yuan or so, Canada rose by 90 cents. When the quotations were opened, market sentiment was quite steady due to the high price of foreign wheat. However, the thinking of the merchants remained sluggish, as the new wheat was about to come on the market. Although there was a fear of oversupply during the period between the harvest of the old crop and the appearance of the new, there was a force that made it difficult to advance the buying enthusiasm. Therefore, although the price of foreign wheat rose, it seemed irrelevant and remained sluggish. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading was even lighter. Although small and medium-sized factories wanted to offer, there were still few buyers willing to buy. After a mutual exclusion, it felt slightly settled. As a result, this month was 5 li better, June, July and August were 2.5 li better, September was 7.5 li better, and October was 5 li better.</p>
<h3 id="e275">He Xia Rice Market Plummets 23 Cents <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source from each merchant was nearly 30 companies (estimated 4,500 shi of goods). The initial market was still sluggish, and the situation was not good. In addition, although the accumulated stock in Pu was drastically reduced by cutting prices for consecutive days, the quotation for stale goods continued to fall by 50-60 cents due to sluggish sales, and the price of fresh goods was also reduced by 34 cents. As for the thick japonica rice of each merchant, the general trend was similar to that of late rice. However, because of the thick inventory, it was difficult to activate it for a while despite a sharp drop once. The price was slightly fixed because it had already fallen through in the previous dynasty. Fresh ones only fell by a little more than 20 cents, and hot stored ones only fell by a little more than 30 cents. The Du Yangjian rice was somewhat reliant on the lack of goods, and was slightly tired. Yinyuan was also restrained and was soft in the set.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 28 to 29 companies arrived from He Xia, with more than 220 ships in He Xia stock. Various products in the market, white japonica rice, Bai Yuan, early rice, thin rice, Yang Du Jian, Bu Jian, Ke Jian, and zero interest were deserted. The total sales volume in the market was less than 1,500 to 1,600 shi. However, the short-price action of contract sales moved slightly. The price was reduced by a corner for high-quality white japonica rice, 23 cents for medium and sub-quality goods, and 34 cents for contract sales to move the goods. The prices of Bai Yuan early rice and thin rice were also slightly down by about 20 cents. The price of sheep Du Bu and guest rice went down by a corner. The price of Yinyuan was in harmony with the sales, and the price was also tired.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the customer Xian market saw a unified wait-and-see attitude from the host and customer, and the source continued intermittently without end, and the bottom stock was still sufficient, and the goods en route also continued to arrive, so the market heart was very weak. All rice fell by a corner, and after the price fell, there was contact between the mainland and Fuzhou to respond to 1,000 bags of Hunan Coarse Jing Rice, the price was only 6 yuan and 55 cents to 6 yuan and 50 cents. Customer Yuan has been arriving for days, and the market is still soft. Yesterday, there were inquiries from the street and Ningbo, and the total market opened more than 500 bags, and the market temporarily stood still. The opening price of Hunan Machine Yuan was 9 yuan 35 cents, Jiangxi Machine Yuan was 9 yuan 34 cents, and there were few sales and purchases of other goods. The after-market needs to look forward to the continued operation of the customer before there is a turning point, otherwise it will not be easy to get better in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Metals - Overseas Iron Merchant Sales Surge <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>The sales of overseas iron are deserted, and the industry is quite panicked about holding this cargo. What's more, the exchange rate is looser, and the inventory is rushing to sell. The standard, such as the old steel mill cargo, opens at 28 yuan and 50 cents per box, and the new steel mill cargo opens at 27 yuan and 75 cents, which is nothing less than a fall of 50 cents to 1 yuan from the past. In recent days, Tianjin, Qingdao, Fuzhou and Zhenjiang have all started to purchase, and it is estimated that as many as 4500 boxes have been transacted, and there are still many people in negotiations. As a result, the trend is very optimistic.</p>

<p>The stock of daylily is running out recently, and there is still time before the new harvest, such as the smooth operation of sales, there is a new Chen Yu. Therefore, the local price and Shenshi stores are tight, I heard that Zhenjiang letter, the bottom of the stock is less than a hundred bags, it is intended to open for sale four times to gradually increase, and here the store is only two or three hundred bags, so yesterday's market line Zhuang has shouted 24 yuan, although it has not been set, but according to the lack of stock, it is sure to reach this price.</p>
<h3 id="e279">Silk and Tea Zhejiang Cocoons Harvest, Jiangsu Silkworms Lack Leaves <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>▲In the four townships of Hangxian County, the spring silkworms hatch the local species this year, and most of them lose six or seven out of ten in the early days of cold and rainy weather, so they all raise late silkworms, and the improved species hatch later and take care of them, so they lose less. After the big sleep, the weather is sunny and warm, and the silkworms grow well. The early cocoons have been listed, and the silkworm houses have successively opened the scale. The goods on the market are not prosperous, and there are more local cocoons, the cocoon body is secondary, and the cocoon price initially opens at 18 yuan. The improved species is 20 yuan, and the silkworm households are unwilling to sell cheaply, so they all rise by 45 yuan.</p>
<p>▲In the vicinity of Pingyao, Jinjialong and other places, the rural economy is insufficient this year, and there are many incubations of local species, the weather is not right, the resistance is weak, and it is heavily damaged. Later, all improved species were incubated, and the results were good. The new cocoons have been listed, and the total pull is only five or six years old. The cocoon body is better with the improved species. The cocoon price of local species is only 20 to 24 yuan, and the improved species cocoon pull is 32 to 33 yuan. The after-market is bullish.</p>
<p>▲In the Chang'an improved silkworm area, most of the farmers in this session feed improved seeds. Although the weather is cold, the impact is still small. However, the silkworm is more stagnant, and the silkworms develop most smoothly during the big sleep. The early and late cocoons are listed in order, and the cocoon house has been opened for four days. The number of receipts is not prosperous, and the cocoon price is 256 yuan for local species and 35 yuan for improved cocoons. Silkworm households must lose money.</p>
<p>▲Most of the farmers in Danyang cities and villages hatch local species due to economic reasons. However, due to the cold and rainy spring, there is a lot of damage. The silkworms lose a lot of leaves and supplement the improved species. After the second sleep, the weather is sunny and warm, and the development is quite good. The early help has been great sleep Wang Ye, the late help has just started to sleep, and there are those who sleep three times and open the leaves. In recent years, many mulberry trees in the four townships have been dug as firewood, resulting in panic over silkworm feed. The supply is not enough to meet the demand, and the price of leaves has risen to more than two yuan.</p>

<p>In the overseas raw silk market, as new Japanese silk has been listed and Japanese silk merchants have started to dump new silk, silk prices are more difficult to rise. European and American banks in Shanghai are still thinking of suppressing prices and hoarding for new factories. Therefore, transactions are difficult to progress. Yesterday, only British and French banks supplemented the lack of goods, and Yihua and others entered 20 bales of white factory sutras, and Taihe entered 10 bales of white dry sutras, and the price was still firm.</p>

Recently, the weather has turned warm, and the mountain households have been preparing to open the garden as the new tea in various places has been listed. According to the mountain households, the tea trees in each township this year have been frozen by snow last winter, and the development is not prosperous. The number of harvests in the future is about 70% of the old harvest. Only the tender heads of tea leaves are produced, and the quality and taste are better than in previous years. At present, in the village tea line, in addition to the original ones, there are now two new Gongxing and Tongyang, which are preparing to open the market for business, and the market is still showing a thriving atmosphere.</p>

<p>Shaoxing Ping Shui Yao Guo Zhen, near the mountains, is an important tea producing area in Zhejiang Province, and the export volume is no less than Suichun. The mountain households in that place, in the years of the Republic of China 78, in view of the sluggish sales of round tea and the difficulty of livelihood, they decided to change the flag tea to seek new ways out. Every time the new tea is listed, tea merchants from Suhanghu and Guangxi bring money to the producing area to search for purchases. For more than ten years, the business has been prosperous. Unfortunately, in recent years, due to the influence of bandits and the collection of various donations and taxes, the buyers from all over the world have not come forward, so the business has been depressed and almost fallen to the bottom. At present, the tea lines that buy and sell on behalf of customers in that place are also losing money year after year, and the capital is difficult to support. This year, only one or two tea lines are prepared to open in the town, and the market is still quiet and empty, and the scene is quite bleak.</p>

<h3 id="e287">What Kind of Elections Do We Need? <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qiu</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Mr. Gongpu has repeatedly raised the issue of improving elections in this publication. Naturally, this issue is not only of great significance in promoting municipal or local autonomy and other practical situations, but also a vital problem to be solved in the overall political transformation of China.</p>
<p>Although many elections in China's past have failed under unsound conditions, this can never be said to be the fault of "elections" themselves. Because elections are just a method. Whenever people want to place the final right of judgment on social affairs in the hands of the majority, there is fundamentally no other way than the method of elections.</p>
<p>Therefore, what we are now demanding for local autonomy and improved elections is, in fact, to save the development of the spirit of democracy. We believe this is the minimum effort to save the national crisis through political transformation.</p>
<p>Therefore, the question now is not whether we need to improve elections, but mainly what kind of elections we need. Regarding this, I believe:</p>
<p>First, what we need is universal suffrage. The gradual expansion of suffrage in modern times has allowed past class elections to progress to universal elections. Therefore, we demand the abolition of all restrictions based on religion, economy, social status, and gender. Except for underage children, patients with mental illness, and those deprived of their civil rights, everyone should have the obligation and right to participate in elections.</p>
<p>Second, we demand the expansion of the real power of elections. The value of suffrage is mainly reflected in the number of elected officials. The participation of the people in elections is not only to elect advisory bodies for the government, but, more importantly, to elect people who can represent their opinions and directly participate in the thorough resolution and implementation of all major national or local issues. Therefore, we demand that the real power of elections should be expanded. At the same time, we also want to save the implementation of the rights of initiative, referendum, and recall, because these three are interrelated.</p>
<p>Third, attention to election methods. We know that the value and effectiveness of suffrage are greatly related to voting methods. Open elections cannot fully express the will of the voters, and the "designated" election method completely loses the meaning of elections. Now, the election systems of various countries have almost all been changed to secret ballot systems. Therefore, we also demand that this election method be practically used in all elections in China.</p>
<p>Fourth, mandatory elections should be implemented. Suffrage is not only a right of the people, but also an obligation. Election is a public duty, and the state must use all means to ensure that the people fulfill this duty. In the past, most people in our country were often indifferent to elections, on the one hand being manipulated by local bullies and ambitious politicians, and on the other hand causing the people to have no interest in politics. Therefore, we advocate that the government should follow the example of countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, and Spain, and implement a mandatory election system, stipulating that those who do not participate in elections should be subject to certain economic or reputational penalties.</p>
<p>Fifth, demand strict laws against election fraud. Election fraud was a common phenomenon in our country in the past. Now, if we don't talk about elections, then so be it. But when we do talk about elections, on the positive side, we demand to improve the political level of the general public. On the negative side, we demand a strict law against election fraud. The state must use laws to stipulate that anyone who bribes, entertains, intimidates, impersonates, or illegally uses election funds or election campaigners must be given strict punishment.</p>
<p>The above points are our minimum requirements for improving elections. Some people say that this is just an unattainable high-sounding argument. In fact, we know that if an election can truly represent public opinion, and if the result of an election can be supported by the majority of the people, then apart from an election based on the above points, what better method do we have? Therefore, we hope that the authorities in charge of elections should take this as a goal to promote the implementation of sound elections. Whether it is central politics, local autonomy, or social organizations, if there cannot be perfect and sound elections, then all ideals cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>Indeed, "having elections is better than not having elections," but simply "having elections" is not enough. We still need to demand more perfect elections within "having elections"!</p>

<h3 id="e288">Blood Rice <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Long Lai</p>
<p>Living in this unreasonable society where "the rich's wine and meat rot, and there are frozen bones on the road," ordinary people who cannot smell wine and meat, struggling on the line of cold rice and death, in order to live, some have to reluctantly auction off their labor at a low price, and some even sell their own children cheaply, and insist on exchanging the blood of their bodies for leftovers to fill their stomachs. This is what I want to talk about here: the hardworking women who are hired by noble people to be wet nurses.</p>
<p>Just go to the "Employment Agency" in Beiping, the "Job Introduction Shop" in Shanghai, or the "Human Market" in Chengdu, and the "Guild Hall" in Chongqing. We will see these "blood sellers" squatting or sitting in rows like exhibits, waiting to be sold. Their eyes, filled with the bitter tears of leaving their husbands and children, are hungrily and concernedly fixed on passers-by. When they finally wait for a customer to come in, they fearfully and anxiously hold out a pair of eggplant-like breasts, allowing people to choose the fat and pick the lean, examine and fondle them. As a result, the one who is sold is both sad and happy and goes with the master (mostly to be subjected to a blood test by the doctor). The ones who are left behind after being picked and chosen are dejectedly waiting for customers again. Who can see all this without feeling that it is a tragic tragedy? Aren't "blood sellers" even more pitiful than ordinary laborers?</p>
<p>Naturally, to give their blood to the sons and daughters of the nobles to suck, they must first put their own children aside: the better thing is to spend some money to entrust them to someone else's house, or leave them at home to feed them rice soup. Otherwise, if there is no one to entrust or no one to take care of them, they have to endure the pain and simply give them to others or abandon them on the roadside or in the alley. When a woman who works as a wet nurse in this way holds someone else's child to feed her own milk, how deeply she must feel the pain in her heart! Especially when she sees someone else's child opening his little mouth and smiling at her, stretching out his little hands and waving to her so adorably.</p>
<p>In terms of responsibility and work, wet nurses and ordinary maids and sisters seem to have no difference on the surface, but in reality, they are much more arduous than maids and sisters. They not only bear the responsibility of feeding the child, but also have to bear the heavy responsibility of the child's development, health, illness, hygiene, etc. Therefore, once they are hired, they completely lose their freedom in terms of body and action. I remember there was such a tragicomedy: in a mansion where a couple both claimed to be educators, the hostess supervised the wet nurse every day to rub some cold cream and powder on her old melon-peel-like face, saying that her face was too ugly, and the girl would be afraid of resembling her in the future if she drank her milk. As a result, her face, which had been roughened by the wind and frost and haggard by labor, became feverish and painful from being pickled by cold cream and powder. In the end, she couldn't laugh or cry when she looked in the mirror. Speaking of action, it is simply no different from a prisoner in jail, because the young master or lady cannot go without milk for half a day or a night, so they never get to go home for a year or so. They are clearly married women, but the master insists that they keep "live widowhood." Not only that, but even walking casually on the street or in the neighbor's house is subject to interference. If the child accidentally catches a cold and sneezes, then the master will scold her even more for catching a cold because she took the child out for a walk. The more severe masters even use "deducting wages" and "getting out" to suppress her.</p>
<p>Changing the child's clothes and diapers, playing with the child, feeding the child, and rocking the cradle day and night are the general tasks of being a wet nurse. In addition, buying vegetables, cooking,</p>

<p>and sewing are also things that must be done. If the child is a little older, gradually grows teeth, and the sleeping time decreases, and can barely crawl, then the wet nurse's work is not easy. She has to be careful at all times to prevent him from falling, and she cannot leave her post even when sleeping. At this time, the child's every move is not as regular as when he was first born. Take his feeding, for example, before he grows his little teeth, he will tightly bite the breast and rub his gums while feeding. After the teeth come out, he will use his melon-seed-sized new teeth to tear and bite the nipple, often causing the wet nurse's face to twitch, but she cannot complain. She has to swallow the sour tears silently into her stomach. Man eats man, it's true!</p>
<p>When the child is eight or nine months old, his appetite also increases compared to before. The wet nurse always humbly fears that her milk cannot satisfy him, and at the same time, she has to be attentive to the master to show that her milk is good—fearing that her rice bowl will be in trouble. Therefore, whether it is day or night, as long as the child cries, she immediately puts the breast into his mouth, letting the blood-sucking baby slowly suck, even if sometimes sucking hurts her flesh and swallows her blood, she has to endure the pain.</p>
<p>The leftovers in the messy cups and plates are the only food the master gives to the wet nurse. The clothes they wear are the moldy old clothes and pants from the bottom of their chests. As for their wages, the highest is no more than ten dollars, and six or eight dollars is the most popular price. If their own children are still being raised by others, then, apart from the cost of raising their own children, what they earn from the cold rice and leftovers is just a body of anemic thin bones. This is the price of "blood sellers," this is the life of those who eat blood rice.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Chinese Teacher <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Yu</p>
<p>People all know that Chinese teachers are the most hardworking kind of teachers, but what exactly is the picture of toil unfolding in their lives is something that people may not fully understand. In the past year, I had the honor of being such a teacher in a private middle school in this city. I can't say that I really have much experience, but I don't deny that I do have some observations.</p>
<p>First of all, what I need to bring up is the incorrect concept that society has of these teachers. They think that education is noble, and therefore think that teachers, especially Chinese teachers, are eminent scholars and recluses who have not been stained with any earthly concerns. But the truth is absolutely the opposite. They are not only not any eminent scholars and recluses, they not only need bread like ordinary people, but they have to wage a fierce struggle for survival for bread. In this era of talent surplus?), in order to hold on to their jobs, they have to use all kinds of methods to guard against competitors. Even if they want to be noble, they cannot.</p>
<p>Now I will show here the dark side of their lives. Disregarding their health and ability, they often teach at two, three, or even four or more schools. Some teach as many as five or six classes. In terms of clock hours, some teach thirty-six hours per week. They are completely using their bodies like machines. There is almost no talk of teaching efficiency here; we only see a group of people trying to get by struggling and wriggling.</p>
<p>The reason for this is obviously the excessive meager treatment, coupled with arrears of salary, so that their monthly hard-earned income is still sometimes unable to support their families. In this situation, what good way is there to call them to pay attention to teaching efficiency and take on fewer clock hours?</p>
<p>According to the general situation of the educational circles in China today, their hard work is valued by the hour, depending on the nature of public and private schools and the degree of development of that school, and not only the amount of remuneration. Currently, there is such a situation in Shanghai: in a middle school with only one or two years of history and about 100 students, it is very difficult for teachers to receive their salary, although the letter of appointment may stipulate that they should be able to receive five cents per hour. They are not necessarily completely "fulfilling their obligations," because the school still solves their living problems such as "food" and "accommodation." At least there is the benefit of "being able to live in a hotel without paying," which can be said to be of a "semi-obligatory" nature. Sometimes, unexpectedly, they may even be able to receive five to ten yuan per month in "travel expenses."</p>
<p>In a slightly larger private middle school, Chinese teachers can reliably get five cents an hour for their "tuition fee." If you teach Chinese in a certain grade for six hours a week in such a school, then you can get twelve yuan, which is considered a "cigarette money."</p>
<p>In a more "established" private middle school, Chinese teachers can get seven to eight cents per hour. There is one school I know of that is like this: Junior high school one, seven cents per hour, junior high school two, seven and a half cents, junior high school three, eight cents. (Most of what is said in this article refers to the situation of junior high schools.) Private middle schools with one dollar an hour are extremely rare in Shanghai. Public junior high schools can generally reach this amount. In short, this is completely different from the situation in some provinces outside of Shanghai, where junior high school Chinese teachers can receive one yuan, one yuan and twenty-five cents, or one yuan and a half per hour.</p>
<p>Although the treatment is so low, they are required to work twice as hard. Chinese teachers need more time to correct Chinese papers than to teach classes. There is not a single Chinese teacher who does not have a headache looking at some half-baked papers. Normally, a Chinese teacher who is not very experienced can only correct three or four papers in an hour, and those who are more efficient can only correct six or seven papers. However, there are many "lazy" methods in between, which is to judge at a glance—narrative essays are easy to correct, argumentative essays are the most difficult. The best thing is to have the students write something similar (or even the same), for example, you ask them to write according to the "outline" you give, or ask them to translate a classical Chinese text into vernacular Chinese, or write a "sketch" of more than 100 words, etc. The easiest thing to do is to tell them a short story and ask them to write it down, or to present a short text from the textbook and ask them to delete the sentences that can be omitted to shorten the text. Correcting twelve or thirteen or even fifteen or sixteen papers like this only takes you an hour. I remember that once at a banquet held by the Beixin Bookstore to promote its "Mixed Mandarin" and "Beixin Anthology" to Chinese teachers in middle schools in this city, a very healthy teacher said that he could correct fifteen or sixteen papers in an hour. I guessed that he might be using this time-saving method!</p>
<p>Some people may criticize this kind of teacher for being irresponsible, but they really have no choice. They are not only too busy, but also too tired. Normally, a Chinese teacher teaching 20 hours a week is not a lot. Teaching two classes of Chinese and also history or geography means three or four hours of classroom teaching every day, which forces them to go home with a tired body and stare at more than 100 (50 to 60 people per class is very common) half-baked papers with distress. What's more, a part-time Chinese teacher teaches even more hours than 20 hours?</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, it is difficult to have time to engage in research work. Their teaching content has to be pitifully poor. They have to perfunctorily deal with students and please students. Such a teacher has to be a "careless" teacher. Can we still talk about teaching efficiency here?</p>
<p>In order to avoid "misleading the children," I don't want to be such a teacher anymore. But society cannot give people better things to do. The knowledge sold from the university is completely useless to this society, and I have no other "specialty." For some necessity, even though I don't want to harm people in my heart, how is it possible?</p>

<p>— Cang Yu</p>
<p>About five years ago, I was introduced to this blacksmith shop. Among us, getting a job is like getting an official position for those who study.</p>
<p>This is where we work: on the sandy ground, piles of burning coal fire encircled by iron plates, blown by the wind from the underground air duct, the fire burns very fiercely, and the temperature also rises to a very high level. At the same time, the black coal ash and yellow coal smoke also fly up together, because there is a roof above and walls on both sides, so the air in this room is completely shrouded and occupied by this smoke and ash. When I first came to work here, it was really unbearable, because of the invasion of ash and smoke, my eyes were forced to shed tears all day long, and my nasal cavity and lungs were stimulated by strange smells, and my breathing was simply abnormal, but now it seems that I have become accustomed to it and don't feel it. When it rains, the ash and smoke can't get out, which makes people even more uncomfortable. Especially in the summer, the fierce burning of twenty or more piles of coal fire, if it is not a person who is used to it, will not only be suffocated to death but also be suffocated to death.</p>
<p>Like the workers in other departments, we start work at seven o'clock. We are in groups of two or three, and each group occupies a pile of coal fire and an iron stool. We first pile the crushed coal tightly, and then chisel a few holes to let the wind blow out, so that the fire can burn fiercely. Then we bury the wrought iron of what we want to make in the coal fire, clamp it with large pliers, and when it is burned to a certain color, we open the pile of coal. At this time, the heat and strange smell rush out together, and then we pour it with cold water, and the ash and smoke immediately fly up, but we don't dare to be negligent at all. We have to clamp the red-hot iron to the iron stool and hit it with a hammer, you hammer, I hammer, ding ding dang dang. After hammering it, let it cool down, and then put it back in to burn, and hammer it again after burning. This</p>

<h3 id="e291">Reno: Happy City of Divorce <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Mori-kun</p>
<p>This is an interesting story of a capitalist society. Reno, the capital of the state of Nevada in the United States, is geographically just a small metropolis in the barren western mountains, but it is a world-renowned city of divorce, just as Monaco is a world-renowned gambling country.</p>
<p>Judge Sirent, who had approved 20,000 divorce applications in the Reno divorce court in twelve years, said when he retired at the age of sixty-three: "Two-thirds of marriages are failed surgical operations; only divorce is the remedy."</p>
<p>"Come to Reno for a divorce and restore your marital happiness!"</p>
<p>In the United States, the laws of the 48 states are all different. Some believe that "what God has joined together, let no man separate," and the states of Sands and Carolina absolutely do not allow divorce; in the District of Columbia, divorce is allowed only in cases of adultery. Most states cite serious crimes, abandonment, abuse, etc. as grounds for divorce, and there is a necessary process of "residence period" for applying for divorce, and it is necessary to reside in a certain place for one to three years. But in the state of Nevada, divorce procedures are extremely simple.</p>
<p>What makes the state of Nevada famous is not the snow of Sierra Nevada (which means snowy mountains in Spanish), not the virgin forests, not the mining industry, but the convenient and rapid divorce law. Reno, together with Paris and Mexico City, is known as the three major divorce capitals in the world. At the same time, Reno is now also famous for gambling.</p>
<p>About seventy years ago, many people came to Reno for the mining industry, and after only six months of residence, they obtained full citizenship.</p>
<p>According to Nevada's divorce law, if divorce is applied for on the grounds of abandonment, neglect, or abuse, and there is no appeal, a unilateral divorce is allowed; and remarriage is allowed immediately after the divorce. This is not without reason in the United States, which likes everything to be quick. Those who want a divorce run to Reno, and after only six months of residence, they can receive the benefits of local law.</p>
<p>This matter began to flourish especially eleven or twelve years ago. Most of the divorce visitors are from the wealthy class, and there are always more than a thousand people every year, consuming two million yuan in gold and silver. In the eyes of this small place, it is really a considerable income.</p>
<p>Because most of the wealthy class come here to travel and divorce, the prosperity of gambling and dancing is also natural, but therefore, even more people come.</p>
<p>Later, the necessary residence period for divorce was reduced from six months to three months, so the number of visitors increased even more.</p>
<p>Now, comparing the number of foreign divorces after shortening the residence period with those before shortening it, we can get a general idea:</p>
<p>Before shortening 1925——806 cases</p>
<p>After shortening 1927——1,603 cases</p>
<p>The American economy is in recession, and the mining and railway industries are not prosperous. Many unemployed people in Reno have changed to the hotel industry, and the business is very good.</p>
<p>Since May 1, 1931, the three-month residence period has been changed to six weeks. As a result, the unemployed in the neighboring states of Arkansas and Idaho have come to Reno to share the waste of the rich.</p>
<p>Top-quality wine and top-quality song and dance always come to Reno. During the annual Independence Festival (July 4), a grand boxing match is also held. Recently, there have been 189 divorce cases in Reno every day, and each divorce case is completed in six to ten minutes.</p>
<p>Lawyers can earn one million yuan a year, the court 260,000 yuan a year, and public gambling halls earn one million yuan a week, or 52 million yuan a year.</p>
<p>Because remarriage is allowed immediately after divorce, many locals have become rich overnight. A small grocery store owner has become an opponent to a millionaire woman, and a flower girl can hook up with a celebrity.</p>
<p>There is also a small matter that is worth recording, that is, many wealthy people often throw their wedding rings into the Truckee River in Reno, and some unemployed people and vagrants go to the river at night to pan for rings to exchange for food.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>way back and forth, we have tasted enough coal ash and coal smoke, our arms are sore, our hands are numb, and we have sweated enough. The things we want to make are only roughly shaped after such training. Sometimes when we encounter making big things, we can use a steam-powered large iron hammer to hit, which is more labor-saving. It can be said that these things are completely hammered out by hand, because the foreman only gives us a piece of wrought iron and a model. Sometimes we also do the work of bending iron pipes. We take the part of the iron pipe that needs to be bent to burn it, burn it red, and then put it between two iron bars and bend it according to the drawing.</p>
<p>In addition to the eight and a half hours of work during the day, we also have to do night work. But not doing night work is something we absolutely don't want. Think about it, what can we do with seven or eight cents a day? Not doing night work will not even be able to support our families! The lower the job, the lower the wages; the lower the wages, the more we hope to do more night work. In short, we are desperately fighting with life!</p>
<p>The iron hammer hits day after day, and the calendar pages fly away page by page. Five years have passed quickly. During this period, I think we have hammered out a lot of things. They always create some happiness for people and earn profits for some people; but what about us? We are still "our arms are sore," "our hands are numb," and "we have sweated enough" to auction off our labor! Moreover, this blacksmith shop has now added some partners, and more piles of coal fire have been surrounded. The sound of the iron hammer is louder than before, and the coal ash and coal smoke are also denser than before.</p>

<h3 id="e292">Conflicts Between England and Japan in Trade <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Xueyou</p>
<p>Anyone who pays attention to recent international news will surely not overlook the recent head-to-head commercial battle between England and Japan and the complete failure of the Anglo-Japanese consultations! Here, let us try to briefly describe the beginning and end of this Anglo-Japanese commercial war.</p>
<p>Since abandoning the gold standard in 1931, Japan has been actively expanding its trade to the world, using the method of "devaluing the gold standard". As a result, the export trade volume in 1932 increased by 263 million yuan compared with the previous year, with a total amount of 1.41 billion yuan. In 1933, it made even greater strides, increasing by another 451 million yuan compared with 1932, with a total amount of 1.861 billion yuan. This made the British Empire, known as the world's number one trading nation, unable to help but be envious.</p>
<p>It wouldn't matter if Japan's trade volume was just gradually increasing. Unfortunately, one-quarter of Japan's exports are specifically sold to the UK, its autonomous territories, and colonies. In other words, in 1933, Japanese goods exported to the British Empire reached as high as 484 million yen. Among them, the goods exported to India were the most, reaching 205 million yen, almost half of the total British Empire imports from Japan.</p>
<p>Even more unfortunately, Britain has always dominated the world with cotton textiles, and cotton textiles have always been the main export to British autonomous territories and colonies. Japan is now competing with Britain, and the goods it exports to British autonomous territories and colonies are also centered on cotton textiles. In 1933 alone, cotton textiles exported from Japan to various British territories reached 149 million yuan (877.7 million square yards). India had the most, reaching 71.1 million yen (455.1 million square yards).</p>
<p>During the same period, Britain exported 485 million square yards of cotton textiles to India. This is almost equal to Japan's export volume to India.</p>
<p>In order to protect its own cotton textile industry and consolidate the power of the British economic bloc, Britain had to devise a way to resist Japan's fierce attacks. In August 1932, the British government incited the Indian government to revise the import tariff on cotton textiles. As a result, Japanese cotton textiles were subject to a heavy tax, increasing from 31% to 50%, while the import tax on British cotton textiles remained at 25%. In April 1933, British Foreign Secretary Simon notified the Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Matsudaira, that the Indo-Japanese Commercial Treaty concluded in 1904 would be abolished the following year. On September 25, representatives from both Japan and India gathered in Shimla, India. After half a month of meetings, no results were obtained. Later, on October 23, the meeting was moved to Delhi. After several consultations, an agreement was finally reached on January 5 this year. According to this agreement, Japan's annual export of cotton textiles to India shall not exceed 400 million square yards, and Japan must purchase 1.5 million bales of raw cotton from India each year. The import tax on Japanese cotton textiles remained at 50%.</p>
<p>Now that the trade dispute between Japan and India has been resolved, the next step is to negotiate the trade issue between Japan and the British Empire. On February 14 this year, the Anglo-Japanese private cotton industry conference opened in London. The representatives from both sides were all giants in their respective countries' cotton industries. After a month of negotiations, they finally broke down due to the issue of territorial application (Britain insisted that the scope of the agreement should include the markets of third countries other than England and Japan, while Japan insisted that it should be limited to the UK and its colonies). After the breakdown of the private conference, the entire issue was transferred to the governments of the two countries for resolution. After much back-and-forth consultation, no progress was made. On the 3rd of this month, British Secretary of Commerce Runciman handed a memorandum to the Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Matsudaira, and the consultations between the two governments also broke down.</p>
<p>With the breakdown of the consultations between the British and Japanese governments, the British government mobilized all autonomous territories and colonies to work together to exclude Japanese goods. The Anglo-Japanese commercial war has officially begun. (Recently, Australian Foreign Minister Latham went to Japan to conduct preliminary trade negotiations with Foreign Minister Hirota. Although there are no official results yet, due to Australia's relationship as a British autonomous territory, it is feared that there will be no satisfactory outcome in the future.) Although the Conservative Party of England (the most powerful force in the current cabinet) is still dreaming of the "Anglo-Japanese Alliance," the fact is already obvious: the British cotton textile industry can no longer endure Japan's attacks, and from now on, they can only engage in head-to-head commercial warfare.</p>
<p>Regarding the British military deployment in Singapore and various parts of Southeast Asia, the origins of the secret Anglo-Dutch meeting, and the British attitude in the voice of Japan's opposition to "international aid to China,"...we can only grasp the true meaning from the fact of this conflict between England and Japan in trade.</p>

<h3 id="e293">Studying Literature on Your Own - Some Basic Questions! <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>(1) How to Find a Path for Research</p>
<p>Although our starting point for research is the actively evolving concrete literary movement, with the scope roughly limited to existing Chinese creations and translations, it is a relatively narrow field. But how should someone who is beginning to engage in research find a path for research? This is a pressing question.</p>
<p>Entering the study of literature through literary history, and then exploring the various branches in order according to the evolution of literature, is a research method from vertical to horizontal, and it is a good method for self-study. But here, we have many difficulties: because what is becoming our object is constantly changing literature, a complex and contradictory mixture. There is a lack of systematic opinions and decisions on this phenomenon, such as the relatively fixed opinions of past literary histories. And the path of self-study that we want to find still requires us to look for living historical materials, to diligently explore the news of literary organizations and activities, to collect historical materials such as papers, essays, criticisms, and anecdotes about the literary world from the publishing industry and various literary and non-literary publications, and to enrich our own views. From these materials, you can see the mainstreams and trends of literary activities. You can have a more accurate understanding of the complex phenomena of the present, and you will not lose your way forward. Naturally, this road that is unfolding in front of you still needs to be decided by your own will.</p>
<p>(2) How to Increase the Ability to Discriminate</p>
<p>In order to have a considerable ability to understand modern works, you should have knowledge of literary theory. To understand the works of a certain school, it is best to first read all literary theories about that school. Although theory is derived from facts, a scientific action takes the knowledge accumulated from past actions as the starting point of theory. Therefore, scientific action is guided by theory.</p>
<p>We should have the following basic knowledge:</p>
<p>1. On the theory of art</p>
<p>2. On literary trends of thought</p>
<p>3. On the social basis of literature and art</p>
<p>4. On aesthetics... and other more specialized research</p>
<p>This part of research should account for a large proportion and be the center of literary research. From this, you can complete the tasks that should be performed in the first item.</p>
<p>For the above aspects, it is of course possible to conduct separate specialized research.</p>
<p>Only when this part of the work is done sufficiently can you exert your power.</p>
<p>(3) Literature and Other Sciences</p>
<p>Literature is not an isolated thing that is unrelated to other sciences. On the contrary, it maintains appropriate and coordinated relationships with social sciences and other sciences. If you want to study literary theory, you need to have a solid foundation in social sciences and other sciences. A person who lacks research in social sciences cannot truly understand literature or be a literary scholar.</p>
<p>A writer, like a reader, should deeply cultivate his own foundation, and at the same time apply what he has learned to literature?</p>
<p>You must quickly learn the following sciences.</p>
<p>1. Basic knowledge of economics to understand modern society.</p>
<p>2. Basic knowledge of sociology to understand the course of social evolution;</p>
<p>3. Basic knowledge of social ideology to understand social consciousness;</p>
<p>4. Basic knowledge of philosophy on the scientific worldview, worldview and outlook on life.</p>
<p>(4) Literature and Life</p>
<p>Literature cannot be separated from life. To understand a modern work, even if you have the above theories, if you are separated from the practical life, you cannot grasp the center of gravity of the era, and there is a risk of becoming mechanistic or metaphysical. Therefore, a writer and a reader should understand literature in practical life.</p>
<h3 id="e294">The Original Broadcasting Station for International Broadcasting - The Soviet Union's Flax Industry <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>During the first Five-Year Plan, the area of flax cultivated land roughly doubled, which was 2.7 times greater than before the war.  At the same time, in other European countries, this area has decreased by more than half (60 percent).  In 1932, the Soviet Union's flax production accounted for 90 percent of the world's total production.</p>
<p>The massive increase in the area of flax fields is due to the social and economic changes in Soviet agriculture that laid the foundation.</p>
<p>As for the area of ramie cultivated land, it has now increased to 800,000 hectares (Hectares, a French land area unit), while before the war it was only 680,000 hectares.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan, the main producers of flax and ramie were individual farmers (Individual Peasants). At that time (1928), the flax production of collective farms only accounted for six-thousandths of the total production. By 1932, collective farms and state-owned farms had become the main producers of flax and ramie, and their output had reached more than 65 percent of the total production.</p>
<p>What is particularly needed in the cultivation of flax and ramie is cultivation machine stations. In 1932, there were 261 such cultivation machine stations specifically set up for the cultivation of flax and ramie. There were 7,593 cultivators active on 500,000 hectares of flax cultivated land (one times greater than the rest of Europe) and 80,000 hectares of ramie cultivated land.</p>
<p>These many cultivation machine stations are all equipped with the most modern agricultural machinery. Here are the best-trained political supervisors, managers, and rural economic forces丨丨These are powerful tools for greatly increasing hemp production.</p>
<p>State-owned farms and collective farms (mostly in areas with cultivation machine stations) now have 15,000 well-trained flax threshing workers.</p>
<p>The results obtained from the effort to increase flax production are not only that the area of flax cultivated land has expanded, but also that there has been a significant increase in harvests, and the number of hemp products that can be sent to the market has naturally increased even more.</p>
<p>The method of purchasing hemp is now completely different from the past. Under the circumstances where market transaction prices are uncertain, the state needs to stipulate in the contract that producers (collective or individual) are given the benefit of loans and advances, and the latter supplies cotton products to the state. In these contracts, the state provides producers with necessary subsidies in production, such as providing them with agricultural machinery, mineral fertilizers, grains, selected seeds, and credit and monetary advances. At the same time, hemp producers engage in cultivating a certain amount of hemp fields, and depending on the agricultural technical consumption required for this type of cultivation, they are required to contribute a certain percentage of the high-quality harvest to the state within a certain period.</p>
<p>This flax loan and advance contract began to be implemented on a trial basis in 1927, and the ramie loan and advance contract began to be implemented on a trial basis in 1929. During this period, this method was only implemented on a trial basis on 9% to 14% of the cultivated land area. By 1931 and 1932, the area cultivated using this method had increased to more than 84 percent of the total hemp field.</p>
<p>Regarding the collection of hemp, the Soviet government has specially established a hemp industry department to manage it. Here, they often plan how to increase production and improve quality.</p>
<p>The task assigned to hemp producers in the first Five-Year Plan was to greatly expand the area of hemp cultivated land, and this has developed exactly as desired. The 2.3 million hectares of flax fields and 860,000 hectares of ramie fields stipulated in the 1933 plan were realized without any difficulty. Flax production increased by 20 percent in 1933, with a total production of 550,000 tons in one year.</p>

<p>After you understand the living environment of the upper social strata, you should also understand the lives of social strata different from yours. Because of the differences between social strata, there are obvious differences in internal consciousness; even in daily habits, living moods, and language, different imprints are left. How should you explore this? This is a very important and interesting question.</p>
<p>On the one hand, be faithful to the investigation of your own life, carefully record its truth, and clarify the characteristics of your own social stratum. Don't let up on a single point. At the same time, you should talk to people from social strata different from yours, mingle with them, and carefully understand everything about them. You should visit factories, mines, warships, schools, offices, slums, and even brothels and prisons. You should pay attention to the comedies and tragedies of life in all social strata. On the streets, in streetcars, and in theaters, you should patiently read court judgments, social news, and local communications.</p>
<p>All of these can provide you with rich materials and broaden your horizons.</p>
<p>The above is the most valuable learning of life, not only for the study of literature.</p>

<h3 id="e295">Innocent Children - The Greatest Messengers of Heaven <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yuehan</p>
<p>Children are great, so philosophers and poets throughout the ages have worshiped children.</p>
<p>Mencius said: "A great man does not lose the heart of a child." Jesus said: "Children are the greatest messengers of heaven." Lao Tzu said: "Focus solely and be as weak as an infant." Goethe even said: "We should take them (children) as teachers." The great thinker Marx also often said: "The place in the Christian Bible that I pay most attention to is its great love for children."</p>
<p>Why are children so worthy of worship? Is the worship of children just a temporary pleasure for adults? Or have adults really discovered in children the greatness that adults do not possess? Are children stronger than adults? Are their intellectual abilities superior to adults? Are their experiences and thoughts superior to adults?</p>
<p>To understand the true greatness of children, we cannot use ordinary people's views to measure children. We must experience the greatness of children from the children themselves. The American child psychologist Hall said: "Childhood is the heaven of mankind, and adult life is a fall from it." This is absolutely correct. All the wisdom we adults have is inseparable from slave prejudices. All my habits and all past traditions oppress the minds of us living people like nightmares. From childhood to death, adults are not free from the shackles of slavery. What qualifications do we have to comment on the personality of children?</p>
<p>Children, why are they great? It is because children have the innocence that adults do not have. Children cry when they want to cry, and laugh when they want to laugh. They never care about forces outside of themselves. The nature of children makes children only seek self-development and satisfaction of happiness. A child is a fearless pursuer of happiness. Children can seek comfort from adults, but they cannot easily give what they have in their hands to others. In other words, children are completely natural people who live for themselves. Children have absolutely no adult prejudices or moral concepts. This is the greatness of children.</p>
<p>Some people may retort: If what you say is true, then children are just selfish and self-interested creatures. What is there to be great about them, and what is there to worship? My answer is: Yes; children are indeed selfish and self-interested creatures, but this is precisely where the greatness of children lies.</p>
<p>What is greatness? Greatness refers to things that benefit mankind. The reason why children are great is because children are a symbol of happiness.</p>
<p>Everyone lives for themselves, and everyone has the instinct to pursue happiness. And when he encounters obstacles in his pursuit of happiness, he can break the obstacles without any fear. The destruction of objects that hinder him is a manifestation of this instinct. So many people say that if children had the power of adults, they would be great villains in the world.</p>
<p>But we adults all come from childhood. How did adults lose the nature of childhood? This cannot but be attributed to the social system of mankind. In the long-term struggle for survival, mankind has realized that sacrificing certain pleasures and desires and development is necessary, so a social system that departs from personal wishes naturally arises. The social system is to the individual as the owner of a garden is to flowers and trees. The owner always tries to make the flowers and trees lose their self-desires and development, so that they suit his own preferences. Therefore, the social system deprives people of their absolute existence, so that they no longer know themselves. Later, society not only makes its members sacrifice certain instinctive needs to satisfy certain instinctive needs, but also makes some people sacrifice instinctive needs to satisfy the unlimited needs of other people. Mankind has reached this point, just as Rousseau said:</p>
<p>'Except for the whole and public life, they do not know that they have themselves.'</p>
<p>But the need instinct and the desire for satisfaction of mankind will not be eradicated by suppression. Mankind is like a willow tree that grows upward. If you force it to bend, you can do it temporarily, but its original nature will not change, and it will still flourish upward when artificial means cannot reach it. So Gaozi said: "To use the innate nature as benevolence and righteousness is like using a willow tree to make a goblet." If mankind cannot completely lose the instinct to seek satisfaction and freedom, then children preserve the simple form of these instincts. Therefore, children become a symbol of happy mankind and are messengers of heaven. The innocence of children awakens the adult slaves who lost their instincts and desires at the entrance of civilization. Therefore, adults who feel like slaves develop respect for this great enlightenment of children.</p>

<h3 id="e296">Two Fairy Tales for Children to Read <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Jinshan</p>
<p>The fairy tales that Chinese children read are mostly about princes, nobles, gods, and monsters... kinds of characters. The influence of these fairy tales on children, in addition to making them imagine that they can also be in the situation of the protagonists in the fairy tales, it is very difficult to find some social and scientific knowledge to instill in children. But the few fairy tales that I have seen now, although not written by Chinese people, but translated, have completed the above requirements and are suitable for Chinese children. So I will now make a brief introduction, which can also be regarded as doing a voluntary advertisement for bookstore owners.</p>
<p>The first book is "Charlie Chaplin's Travels" by the new American writer Gold. The story is about a little boy, Joe, and his two older brothers, Adam and Andy, who went out for a picnic one day, but he himself was sick in bed because he ate too much ice cream. He asked to hold a race, but his mother said that the room was too small to hold it and asked him to get a good night's sleep, so he started to quarrel. But he could not resist the power of the Sandman, and slowly fell asleep. Then the clown Charlie Chaplin appeared. Charlie Chaplin very skillfully arranged a race for Joe; he took Joe to the mayor of New York to ask for permission for the race, but the mayor said that the race was too much trouble for him and refused to issue it. Charlie Chaplin then took Joe to ride an elephant to find the giant Jem丨丨He was a very kind black man who could play the "saxophone" (an American instrument). The giant Jem kindly agreed to Joe's request, climbed onto the elephant, and began to play his "saxophone". Everyone who heard him play the "saxophone" would follow him, so slowly a huge race formed. Joe was very happy in his heart. When they arrived in New York, the mayor and his police had already taken clubs and were ready to arrest them for disturbing the peace. Charlie Chaplin escaped, and Joe also escaped. The mayor chased after Joe, and Joe was so scared that he was about to cry, and woke up.</p>
<p>You see, isn't this an interesting fairy tale?</p>
<p>Another book is "The Adventures of a Young Pioneer" by the Soviet Russian Lozanov, which gives children more novel enlightenment about social and scientific aspects.</p>
<p>The story is of course also about a little boy, Traffoker. Once, he and his father went out to be guests. But unfortunately, his father and son were separated at the train station. So Traffoker decided to be independent and start his own life. In this way, in this book, the author tells each reader about telegraphs, train station management systems, train locomotives, signal machines, telephones, automobiles, postal telephones, public taxis, newspapers, typesetting, page layout, printing, trams, and inquiry bureaus... and also implies the socialist construction to the reader. The ending is of course that Traffoker was found by his father and mother.</p>
<p>Both of these books have very moving illustrations. The former is 20 cents per copy, and the latter is 50 cents per copy.</p>

<h3 id="e298">Marconi, the Inventor of Wireless Telegraphy (7) <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Sen Ran</p>
<p>We know that since the Renaissance, with the development of capitalism, there have already been many great inventions in science. Leaving aside other things, just the inventions directly related to wireless telegraphy, there were many before Marconi became famous, such as the electromagnetic telegraph, generators, telephone, wired telegraph... all of which were invented before Marconi began his research. All these inventions, all the scientific and cultural heritage since the Renaissance, are the foundation for Marconi's invention of wireless telegraphy. Without this foundation, no matter how clever or persevering he was, he would not have achieved such success. Imagine, if Marconi had been born in the dark ages of the Middle Ages, could he have invented wireless telegraphy? Of course not! This is one reason.</p>
<p>Secondly, the era in which Marconi lived was the era of capitalism's development into imperialism. In this era, the capitalist economic network had already enveloped the entire world. Imperialist countries were striving to compete for markets to sell goods, and desperately vying for colonies. Under these circumstances, rapid transmission of information was required in commerce, military affairs, and politics. Marconi's invention of wireless telegraphy was realized under this demand. In this regard, we can say that the British naval exercises and the South African War at that time were greatly related to Marconi's success.</p>
<p>At the same time, the place where Marconi was born and raised also has an inseparable relationship with his invention. We know that he was born in Italy and active in Britain and America. These countries are all advanced countries, and their cultural level is above average. The so-called modern civilization is represented by them. Only in such a social environment could Marconi have the possibility of inventing wireless telegraphy. If he had been born in China or India, he would not have accomplished such a great undertaking.</p>
<p>In addition, Marconi's personal living environment is also very important. The issue is very obvious: if he had not been born into a wealthy family, had not received higher education, and if he had not received guidance from Professor Righi, had not been inspired by Hertz's experiments, and had not encountered Preece's help, then I dare say that no matter how great a genius he was, he would eventually be buried. As for the invention of wireless telegraphy, it would have to be left to others.</p>
<p>Naturally, we cannot deny Marconi's intelligence and perseverance. But this is only one factor that enabled him to become a great inventor; what made this possibility a reality was the era he lived in, society, and his personal living environment.</p>
<p>Finally, after evaluating Marconi, I hope that those who generally admire heroes and geniuses will not be superstitious about heroes and geniuses, but should understand them scientifically. Only in this way will we not go down a mysterious path! (The End)</p>
