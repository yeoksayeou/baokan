<h3 id="c14">爲開發西北進一言 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 舒</p>
<p>近日我國政治上負責人員。多能注意於内政利弊之興革物質建設。已漸由宣傳而入於實行時期。在此國難嚴重强隣逼視之際確可謂爲一良好之象徵也。近如經濟委員會長宋子文之考察西北。考試院院長戴傳賢之巡視陜甘。皆具遠大之眼光。惟開發西北。國人已倡之數年。迄今仍無若何可觀之成績。而西北人民反愈見困苦不堪。如河套則兵燹餘刦。沃壤竟成荒地。如陜</p>
<p>甘則飢饉爲災。子女視作陌路。如新疆則戰亂頻仍。隱患。正多。如康藏則政敎不恊。烽烟時起。如四川則共黨作祟。民多流離。足見開發西北之聲浪雖高。而前途阻碍孔多。殊不易立求速效也。</p>
<p>就目前情形而論。西北爲較落後之區域。數年來屢經天災人禍。生機殆已斵喪。人民自行更生之力。猶且異常薄弱。從事開發。更感棘手。蓋西北僻處邊境。幅員遼闊。幾經喪亂。人口稀少。經營農業。且有若干困難。發展工業。尤非易事。而地方軍政當局。祇顧目前一時之私利。對於民生疾苦。不甚注意。是以富者寖假而窮。窮者更無立錐之地。重以交通阻滯。經濟發展。非常遲緩。人民智識。非常低落。凡此種種。影響及於西北全境者。皆甚重大。總之今日而言開發西北。有最應注意者數事。（一）如何供給開發西北所必須之工具。此種供給。應不專限於金錢。蓋開發之舉。固非巨量金錢不辦。而當此百廢待興之會。人力之集中。亦爲當務之急。所謂人力。並非盡指勞心的材。一般勞力的人材。亦屬必要。如河套境内之人口不過五萬安能耕種三萬方里以上之土地。甘新等省區。人口稀少之現象。尤爲嚴重。移民實邊。不容再緩。東南各省人口過剩。似可移往西北。以資調劑。惟兩地氣候懸殊。生活習慣亦逈不相同。屯懇計劃。惟有就近推移。如驅川陜之人以殖甘新。則在風俗習慣及經濟組織各方。皆較便宜。（二）西北省區。除川陜之外。猶多保存牧畜時代之經濟形。態手工業且不甚發達。欲其應付今日之環境。必嫌困難。如新疆内蒙一帶。强隣環視。危險更甚。故政治上之措置。尤急於經濟上之建設。（三）開發西北。不能不充分利用近代之機器。不過在運用機器發展工業之先。第一須知考究當地手工業之能力何如。第二須考慮是否爲有益於當地民生之生產事業。中國外農立國。西北尤爲一廣漠之農牧塲勿因工業之畸形發展致更惹起農村之衰落破產。（四）整頓國防。應不專以兵力爲基礎。而須以整個的國民經濟力爲後盾。西北國防。决不能單恃西北一隅之力量不過開發之舉果能成功。則其有補於國民經濟力者旣多。裨益於國防者。當亦非淺鮮也。</p>

<h3 id="c91">德傳將承認僞滿内幕　寸草春暉館柏林通訉　謠言從日方放出　德當局聲明否認 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>月餘以來、關於德國行將承認僞組織之謠傳、甚囂塵上、歐洲報紙、揭載此項矛盾消息甚多、經駐德使館多方探聽、並向德政府質詢、始悉此事内容、茲特分述如次、</p>
<p>柏林方面所得消息、最堪注意者、有以下二則、（一）日本聯合社消息、謂關於德滿經濟問題之談判、已在東京開始、德國駐日大使狄克生ＶｏｎＤｉｒｃｋｓｅｎ及新在滿洲考察回日之德大使館隨員克洛爾Ｋｎｏｌｌ、德國駐哈爾演領事巴爾色Ｂａｌｓｅｒ、均參加、又謂克洛爾隨員、將於三月一日回柏林、關於德國承認（僞）滿洲國問題、亦將於此時報告云云、（按此項消息、曾見一九三四年二月十七日柏林日報、該報係根據阿姆斯特丹消息、而旅德日人俱樂部二月十七日所發表之消息亦同、可知此項消息、確由日方傳出、）（二）柏林日耳曼日報	Ｇｅｒｍａｎｉａ本年二月二十一日轉載倫敦ＦｉｎａｎｘｃｉａｌＴｉｍｅｓ消息、該報駐東京訪員稱、德人思在滿洲取得經濟根據地之計畫已失敗、日法在滿實業投資團將簽字、而德國未獲參加、在十八個月以前、塞克推將軍ＶｏｎＳｅｅｋｔ曾擬供給滿洲軍火、卒被（僞）滿拒絶、去年九月十號、德國駐日武官鄂狄上校Ｏｔｔ、曾持德内閣總理喜特來親函赴滿、討論承認（僞）滿洲國問題、要求滿洲與德以某種專利權、德國因此項計畫失敗、德商相率離滿、僅天利洋行Ｓｔｉｎｎｅｓ尙在該處云云、</p>
<p>按以上兩種消息、不獨使中國方面深抱</p>
<p>不安、卽平日同情華方之德人、亦頗滋疑慮、曾由駐德使館、迭向德外部質詢、並向他方探聽、結果始知此項消息、全屬捕風捉影之談、</p>
<p>（一）關於上述柏林日報所載德滿關係消息、駐德使館曾令參事譚伯羽·非正式訪問德外部負責人員、據答全屬子虚、惟德國駐哈領事巴爾色君、確曾在東京逗留、惟無工若何使命、又謂、巴爾色赴日、曾紆道往檀香山、晤其子於某德艦中、至如克洛爾隨員回柏林報告一節、更屬無稽、（按此項消息、曾見於本年二月十七日旅德日人俱樂部所發表之三三七號情報）</p>
<p>（二）本年二月二十六日德國電訊社、ＤｅｕｔｓｃｈｅＭａｃｈｒｉｃｈｔｎｓＢｕｒｏ曾發表消息云、日來盛傳德國行將承認（僞）滿洲國、查該項傳聞、據負責方面申明、係有心人造謠、全與事實不合、同日柏林播音電台、</p>
<p>亦散布同樣消息、德國各重要報紙、亦揭載同樣消息、柏林日耳曼日報二月二十二日轉載德國外交政治通訊社、關於［德國與滿洲］一文辨駁、尤較露骨、該文略謂、德國駐日使館館員、曾一度赴滿考查商務、確有其事、至如塞克悌將軍雖曾經赴滿、僅係私人性質、至如鄂狄上校並無持德内閣總理親函赴滿之事、德國在滿洲之商行、均照常營業、與日法投資團絶不相關、</p>
<p>就以上各項消息綜合觀察、德國行將承認僞組織之舉、一時必不至實現、且德國負責要人、曾謂日人因滿洲受血肉之犧牲、决無爲他人謀利益之意、細繹此語、</p>
<p>德國縱因經濟關係、不甘居滿洲市塲之外、但權衡輕重、德國决不致首先承認僞組織、可斷言也、</p>

<p>日軍駐在中東路沿線、都已頓整行裝、預備回去了、他們是號爲凱旋、各人面上都具着笑容、我們則有無限說不出的苦痛、並且還更換了强有力的部隊－名古屋師團－來、其用意何居、此間人士、大體巳經明白、是在乎對蘇聯、但是日軍曉得專靠兵力打仗是不够的、何况近代戰爭、需要龐大兵力、需要强有力的運輸機關供其利用、東北三省境内、誠然是鐵道縱横、差不多可以敷用、但還不足以與蘇聯對壘所以現在决定立卽興築七條鐵道、各路線如下、</p>
<p>（一）牡丹江到佳木斯鐵路</p>
<p>（二）凌源到承德鐵路</p>
<p>（三）葉柏壽到亦峯鐵路</p>
<p>（四）二站到黑河鐵路</p>
<p>（五）長春到大賚鐵路</p>
<p>（六）大賚到洮南鐵路</p>
<p>（七）懷遠到索倫鐵路</p>
<p>這七條路線、巳由長春僞政府日與關東軍商妥、由南滿鐵道有限公司承造、（我們要知道南滿公司是等於英國的東印度公司、並不是尋常的企業或商業機關、）</p>
<p>預定工程費爲一萬四千萬日金、其建築材料、不消說完全由日本或滿鐵所屬各公司供給、</p>
<p>單就表面上看、這好像是一種經濟的事業其實並不如此、先看凌源到承德這條鐵道非但是從此要扼制熱河全省、並且據霧靈山脈的形勢、有西窺察哈爾南擾河北的陰謀、至於葉柏壽到赤峰一綫、外人多以爲其意在攫取當地金鑛及其他出產、其實這還是次要的意義、最主要的是進據内蒙、同時還附帶得有侵入外蒙的企圖、</p>
<p>其次、是沿牡丹江由牡丹江站經依蘭到佳木斯這條鐵路、原來日本的經營東北、以往是注全力於南滿、在北滿方面、還不能控制着中東路、現在吉會路差不多算是成功、由圖門到牡丹江、也快要築成、可是日本對松花江岸的移民、並沒有保障、吉林東北的軍事運輸、也毫無凖備所以要趕快的把這條鐵路修起來、一則可以立起侵略北滿的經濟基礎、二則攻擊蘇聯的東海濱省也增加多少方便、</p>
<p>再次、是日本對蘇聯的軍事計劃、現在雖然沒有完全確定、但在北滿的攻勢防禦、滿洲里的邊堡、不是近代軍事上可以借用的東西、沿黑龍江佈防、旣易遭受損失、又會惹起當前的困難所以經過關東軍方面幾次的考察、終决定以大興安嶺爲西部對蘇的防禦第一綫、現在正趕築堅固的堡壘、長春到大查、大賚到洮南、懷遠到索倫、主要的意義、就是加重大興安嶺建築防禦工事的便利、在將來一旦發生事變、又多一個可供利用的工具、並且側面還可以攫取錫林郭勒盟、進入察哈爾的東部這是日本陰謀的兩面、</p>
<p>還有是二站到黑河這條路、是直射黑龍江對岸的海蘭泡了、想運用這條路、藉重兵衝斷烏蘇里鐵道與西比利亞間的連絡、則他襲取海參崴、會容易些、同時、如果能够順序達到他所希望的目的、則東京大阪、可以减少空襲的威脅、因此他非常</p>
<p>着力於這條鐵路的興築、要在短時期内造成其攻勢的實力、要把他的鐵手和蘇聯碰一碰、至於勝負的决定、恐怕還掌握在站在側邊的人手裏、也未可知、（四月十七日）</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3 id="c190">怎樣蒐集及鑑别國際新聞（三） <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>兩日來對於國際新聞的鑑别已略提示過一些原則了。今日冉繼續作原則的提示並略及雜誌，社論等讀法。編者　　第四，要瞭解新聞的試探作用。譬如滿洲僞國改制前，日本固意放出許多一謠言］，試探國際間的空氣，最近日本欲更進一步的進攻中國，特於四月十七日日外務省對列强發表［對華不許染指］的聲明，都是以新聞去作外交的先聲。自然，試探之後，如果不遭受大的打擊，接着的就是直接打動，否則，或一時緩和，轉入另一政策的也有。試探在外交進行遇到重大打擊時，有很大的作用，這時通訊社發出的新聞每每故意散佈一種樂觀空氣，使外交的困難和緩。總之；一國的新聞，總是與本國的外交政策作密切的呼應的，而試探則多用於外交進行的猶豫期間。所以，我們對於［試探］不能看作祇是［試探］，還應注意新聞的發展。</p>
<p>第五，所謂新聞的發展，卽一件國際事變的過程，這一點常常爲讀報者所忽視。在中國報紙上，因爲缺乏有系統的論述，尤其感覺這種困難。我們應注意每日報上的新聞發稿的時間，及在這一件新聞前後關聯的許多新聞，不應把每天的新聞看成固定的，要在前後關聯中去求一件新聞的瞭解。關於這一點，日報每每不能滿足讀者之望。日報本身自然也知道這是一種缺項，補救的方法大槪是用加載［國外通訊］，如申報［國外通訊］，新聞報，民報［歐洲通訊］是，或者於每週出一種［每週情報］，或撰較有系統的專著或社論，提供讀者系統的知識。所以這些通訊，論著，都應細閱。</p>
<p>第六，也是最後應注意的，就是各國報紙上印出的新聞，絶對客觀的獨立性是少有的。它總是經過一番考慮，加以多少修正，使之適合自己的政治主張，外交政策，卽令不是官家報館依然不能登載違反根本立國原則的消息。所以，讀者不應以私家報館登出的東西，全然都是可靠的。譬如，路透社，它决不會登載藏兵犯康是英帝國的背影，哈瓦斯社也不會指出九小島確是屬中國的，日聯，新聯對於四月十七日日外務省聲明，不會認爲是日本陰謀獨佔中國。不僅他們如此，卽英，法，日本私家報紙，平日自誇是客觀立塲，無政治背影者亦不敢出此。一切都與政治有關，現在的報紙尤其是一種政治的工具，不能有超政治的國際消息。卽令某種消息，它本身確係眞實，而又不迎合統治者，突然獨樹一幟，它本身必代表一種政治，所以，站在客觀立塲的國際研究家，如欲弄明是非眞僞，對於每一國際事件，首先就應洗去上層一些加添的東西。</p>
<p>第七，不要忽視了報紙上記載，政治人物的一言一動，一個簡短的消息有時會包含很大的意義。羅斯福的國策，常常是在遊艇中决定的，赫里歐亦最喜歡遊歷，他遊過西班牙，也逛過莫斯科，同時也使法西，法蘇的邦交改善了。其他如政客多病，闊人請客，兩國的公主王了聯姻，藝術博覧會，遊歷團，觀光隊，交換敎授，等等國際間的交際，有時亦特别値得注意。至若，像謝米諾夫（白俄領袖）從日本跑到哈爾濱，李維諾夫從莫斯科到華盛頓，是有非常意義的。</p>
<p>以外，關於雜誌，雜著，社論之類的東西還得稍加提示。</p>
<p>這些東西，大體上，在論述一國際事件時，都有一定的系統，比起讀日報，容易使人獲得一件事變的整個的槪念。不過，這類東西總要比電訊遲緩幾日或幾十日，不能像日報那樣飛速。這些東西，不用說是研究國際問題的人所必讀的。但這類東西的宣傳作用也比一條電訊，數則新聞來得强大。讀者容易被它俘虜。這些東西全部是政治的，有意識的宣揚某一政治主張。選擇這一部分材料時，最好同時選擇其反對方面的意見，作比較的對照。讀者尤應注意這種刋物的背影，著作人的黨派等。</p>
<p>總之；國際新聞的觀測總是從反面，側面，或前前後後去推敲的地方多，直接從正面看是少的。所以，在現制度下一切都要在矛盾中去認識，不能聽取一方面的意見。最最要注意的是一切都要當作過程去了解，尋出推進國際情勢的主要線索。</p>
<p>關於以上的幾點，不過是編者信手寫出的東西，辯識國際新聞的方法，自然不止於此。但聰慧的讀者，如果能將以上各點充分的加以運用，那也就頗有可觀了。辯别新聞的眞僞不是技術的問題，而是需要一點學識訓練的，所以我希望讀者不要忽視最基本的社會科學的理論的學習。</p>
<p>我們希望不久還得有其他的機會，再詳細的討論這一問題。（完）</p>

行都在規律中活動的、現在新生活運動所講的生活規律、有如此嚴的嗎、惟其共如此、所以中國過去社會、雖沒有社團的組織、雖沒有精密的法律、但因生活方式中間、有了嚴密的規律、雖社會無形式的組織、而有精神上的結合、故社會不致混亂、秩序頗見整肅、這全是生活的規律、就是以禮來維擊社會的其效力普遍而深入、比法律尤大、法律有時而窮、惟有禮敎的力量、是感人於無形的、然此種規律、繁文縟節太過、在封建社會有閒階級裏面、不妨如此去做、以之來行於今日的社會、也覺得許多不合於現代的人生、所以我們要提倡新生活了、

<p>春秋御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯　　　　這輛機關車的内部的地位，似乎比尋常的地位，似乎比尋常的機關車要大一倍，否則怎樣能够容得下七個工人在裏面工作呢？－雖然事實上，這七個人並不是個個在工作。在煤水車後面的那半輛工役車上，你不容想找到一張凳子，一張椅子，或一張桌子，爲的是防備這些工役們在沒有人注意的當兒，私自坐下去。現在，我們再要講這些工役們所穿的太監式的宮袍了。當然，他們是絶對不能使這些衣服保持淸潔的，穿不到半天工夫，便混身給烟灰和油垢所塗滿了。待到這個時候，便立刻要換了。舊的就丢到了車外去，－誰也不會想到這是一個火車小工所穿過的衣服－另外又穿上了新的。这些經費，都是歸内務部担負的。那末，讀者也許要問，這樣好的衣服，就是沾了油垢，工役們何不帶回去洗乾凈了再穿呢？但是，他們也知道這一次以後，正不知道何年何月，再會替皇太后開火車；而且在平常的時候，他們穿了這樣服式，必遭他們的戚友所譏笑。原來他們是不配穿的！皇太后在沒有開車以前，對於火車怎樣會行動的種種緊要點，差不多全知道了；雖然伊並不曾親自上機關車去參觀過，但是伊已把所要問的問題，全問過了，而且還命令這列車在伊面前向前向後的試行過，所以伊相信這列車對於伊，實在是不會發生什麽危險了。還有一點，也是很有趣的。伊的記憶力竟是特别的强，在幾個月之後，伊往往還能很詳細地告訴人家伊在火車所經歷的種種情形，而且都是非常微細的。（二一）衣冠葬  離鴻　　在四童軍舉行過衣冠葬之後，最近項松茂先生也要舉行衣冠葬。一二八日軍的暴動是有計劃的，他們要　用武力壓迫我國的抗日抵貨運動，所以摧燬了商務印書館，就因爲它是我國唯一的文化機關；國人樂用固本肥皂，使得劣貨肥皂的營業慘落，這也就是項氏被慘殺的一個大原因。據目擊的人說，項氏被刦到日軍司令部的時候，日官詰問項氏爲甚麽要組織義勇軍，爲甚麽要抵制日貨，項氏大聲說；［我是中國人，當然要愛中國；你我同種，應該共存共榮；爲甚麽要强佔我國的土地？戕害我國人的生命？·····］這一席話更增加了敵人的憤怒，於是項氏就在這時候遭遇慘殺，連屍骸也給敵人燬滅了！史量才先生在追悼項氏的文中說；［物不更變則質不純，人不涉難則志不明；我交松茂先生十年，祗知以勤儉嗇其生，不意以義勇大其死；嗚呼！先生今之貎，古之心。一國難中的衣冠葬禮，我想國人對此不能不奮然興起吧！中國，不容易了解  恂子　　美國文壇的驕子寳珍珠，伊是生長在中國的一位美國女士；伊的作品，因爲都是以中國爲背景，適合美國人好奇的胃口；所以風行一時，不但抽了鉅額的版稅，還得了甚麽奬金之類，可謂名利雙收！　可是，伊的作品，雖然比一般毆美著作家，理解中國，深了一層；而所使用的材料，無非是軍閥的專横，和水旱的頻仍，農民的痛苦；質言之，依舊是描寫了中國的醜惡面！然而，中國文壇上，却有不少捧着這位外國女作家的。中國，到底是難於了解的，不愧有東方神秘古國之稱；寳珍珠女士，不但祇看見了中國的醜惡面；伊生長在中國，自以爲於中國人的生活，深切理解了，然而，有時還是牛頭不對馬嘴。最近，有人在晚報上，譯了伊一篇［母親］；在描寫母親生產之後，說是酣然睡熟了；－原文看過，已忘記了，大意如此，是不錯的·—這和中國人生產的習慣，根本不對；中國的舊習慣，產婦生了孩子以後，二十四小時以内，是撑起着上半身，不許睡熟的；傳統的習慣告訴伊們，說如若睡熟，淤血上升，便要致命的；除非近來用西法接生的，醫生替產婦打了針，才許伊睡熟。了解别一個國家，本來不容易；尤其是一般外國人對於中國！東北四連長  張恨水　　第二十八回巧合共觀塲痴情拾帕殷勤兩問疾誤會投書積之這樣把春聯當着别解研究起來，却也有味。又走了十幾户人家，却才看到一副是新撰的，乃是［心存抗日，誓不戴天。］下聯的誓字和天字，都與上聯活對着，雖不見得十分自然，但是在今天各處看來，要推這八個字爲第一。而且這種春聯標語化的辦法，作者總也算是有心人。看看這人家，是個漆黑小門樓，門中院子，雖是很小，倒也掃得乾乾凈凈的，似乎是個有知識的人家，正這樣打量着呢，對面忽有人呌起來道；甘二爺，過年過得好哇？幾時回來的。積之抬頭看時，却是趙自强的老太爺，後面跟着桂枝和他母親江氏。積之連忙拱手道喜，回說過年好，但是他看到桂枝，心裏立刻回想到去年今日的事。那也是在街上相遇，他第一句，也是過年過得好？心裏極不願回想去年的事，偏偏有這種類似的事，引着人不能不向那方面回味了去。於是心裏連跳了幾下，很快的向桂枝看了一下，就不敢再看了。趙翁笑道；我老遠的就看到二爺向兩邊人家門口張望着，是看春聯嗎？這兒那有好文章？積之笑道；回海甸來了，就沒有事，在家裏悶坐無聊，所以出來溜溜，趙翁笑道；二爺若是沒事，我請你去聽戲。這裏的小戲館子，倒有兩個天橋來的角兒，先别問好歹，反正解悶總是可以的。再說，也讓您這樣的先生們嘗嘗這平民化的戲館子，是什麽味兒？積之本待不去。無如這老頭子後面一句話，有點逼人，若是不去的話，倒顯着自己不能平民化了。（三七二）皇后年　　（電影皇后）（跳舞皇后）（體育皇后）（學校皇后）（·····皇后）（·······皇后）抽烟  姑射　　抽烟可說是最藝術的生活，同時，也可說是最有意義的生活。你想，一枝在手，悠然遐想，瞧着那一圈一圈的烟兒，把人世寵辱都忘。尤其是在風雨之夜，或是數人共話，或是一人獨坐，這時簡直非抽烟不可，不抽烟怕是覺得安身無所。所以，有人以烟，酒，茶三者，稱之爲人生之味情，我想這烟尤其可稱爲味精中之味精。因爲，他可以給人家刺激的機會特别多，因之，他的味精的作用也就特别來得大。稱之爲人生之味精中之味精，實是可以無愧。　不抽烟的人，不會知道抽烟的妙處。抽烟的妙處，有非筆墨所能形容，口舌所能言傳的。不信，你去試試看，只要你剛剛上癮，這妙處便會漸漸［　着些兒麻上來］了。從此以後，你便覺得飯後非抽烟不可，上厠非抽烟不可，這還是初步。到以後，便看書要抽烟，看報要抽烟，寫文章要抽烟，獨坐凝思，尤其要抽烟。至於良辰美景，快意當前，那更其非抽烟不可了。總而言之，要到無論在什麽環境裏都非抽烟不可，這時你的資格便老了，同時，那抽烟的妙處，你也便可以完全領略到了。烟味苦辣，不抽烟的人最所深惡痛絶。然而唯其是烟味苦辣，抽烟的妙處，拞雑話硯的研究（三十二）附錄  無聊客　　硯緣齋硯錄自序編者按無聊客卽硯緣齋主凡人興趣。於作業之外。必有所餘。餘則不能無所寄焉。書也，畫也，琴也，棋也，博也，酒也。皆興餘之所寄也。余則寄之於硯而已。初不過偶然寄之。後則時時寄之而近乎迷。昨偶見鄕先輩章子凡先生文曰。余初好古磚。陸當湖師謂爲玩物喪志之尤甚者。又見東坡居士之文曰。吾有兩手。其一解寫字。而有三硯。何以多爲。施愚山先生亦曰。拙於書而勞於硯。不亦惑歟。甚矣予之惑也。由是遂摒不復觀。同事桂林况君小宋·精鐵筆·兼善榻工。爰擇較可觀者數方。託况君拓而存焉。抑予更有感者。物之聚散無常。昔計壽喬得潘稼堂氏遺硯。嘗致慨於潘之文行兼優。名傳海内。而其子若孫不能守先人之遺澤。因題其四邊天然硯曰。余得此硯。今日之寳而藏者。後日不知又落誰人之手。後之視今。亦猶今之視昔焉耳。達哉斯言。計氏父子藏硯之精且富。名滿天下。稱聞國外。而今亦烟消雲滅。散落又不知幾傳矣。予今日之爲計氏慨。不與當日計氏之慨潘氏同耶。淸季江浙間著名藏硯之家甚多。試訪其家。尙有一存焉者否。最近若沈石友之硯林。且爲日人作品評笑樂之資矣。物不能常聚。理所因然。然則予之於硯。不僅昔日之摩娑玩弄。爲一時偶然之寄。卽今之襲而藏之者。不亦爲偶然之寄耶。予誠自笑予之多事也已。民國二十一年十月六日硯綠齋主識　　例言一　前人於硯，有硯譜，有硯史，名目繁多，然譜有譜系，史有史例，如高南邨硯史，以平凖河渠樂律天官本紀世家等，比擬各硯，雖近傅會，亦不失爲游藝遺風，文人韻事，余則蓄硯旣不多，又無文學以點綴之·故不敢以譜史稱，名云硯錄，紀實也。　　二　昔練水唐衡銓氏繪名硯圖，冠以太極硯，殿以井田硯·中列星斗龍鳳山水花卉諸物硯，取天覆地載中包萬物，以示上下尊卑之意，頗有表示帝制時代意味，余之硯錄，則以硯之較古舊者列前，蓋以明淸時代之出品，雖較以前爲勝，然舊硯之佳者，究愈傳愈少·應加珍視，故余以較古舊者列前，僅是不欲使後來者居上之意，非偏重於古也。便由此發生。不信，當你飯後，口裏膩膩的，抽一枝烟，便淸爽異常，這便是抽烟的初步妙處。抽烟的人無時不覺口膩，因而，也就無時不想抽烟。烟抽得越久，趣味也越無窮。</p>

<p>自由談	故鄕行（二）  林微音　　凝神一看，果然見過的－想不到就是她。［是的，我們見過的，在－－的旅館裏，］我不露破綻地說。［還有在－先生的家裏，］她補充着。這時，我統想起來了。我同她第一次見面是在——的家裏；主人給我們介紹，說她是Ｓ－小姐。我以爲是四小姐，想怎麽介紹得這樣親熱。我沒有聽得說起過介紹者有這樣的一位妹妹，我就想也許是她的太太的；後來聽到他也在稱她Ｓ－小姐，我便確定Ｓ－是她的姓，而以爲是施。後來在——的旅館裏又見到過她一次，依舊以爲她是施小姐。其實從那發音，我更該知道了她的原來的姓的，不知怎麽一纒就那樣弄錯了。雖然，卽使知道了她的眞姓，我也未見得就會知道她就是她，因爲那兩次見面，話實在談得太少了，她的什麽我都不知道。在公共的塲所，我可同人一起坐半天，十小時，十二小時，可是在人家的屋裏，或者自己的屋裏，我可坐不住，坐下了我就想走。可是這次在———小姐的客廳裏，我却坐到了一小時以上。我覺得她很親切，無論什麽不可對别人說的話可以對她說，她决不會來嘲笑你，雖然我沒有把我的去看她是想得到一個新奇的那一回事告訴她。要是我把這對她說明了，他會喜歡？還是不喜歡？至於新奇，其實我還是得到了一個新奇的，因爲我本把她一個人看成了兩個人的，現在方才把她兩個人拚成了一個人，一個眞實的她。　别了她後，我去趁到木半凟去的輪船；我只聽說輪船的班次很多，可是每班的聞行時間我却不知道。我走到一個輪船碼頭，說船剛開走。那裏還有一個人在等着，似乎有些焦急的樣子。［走得去如何？］我對他說；並沒有眞想走的意思，這是在欣喜的情緖下滑出了這樣的一句。［走末走末哉哇，］他英武地回答，顯然把我的商酌看成了挑戰。旣然他答應了，不管我的初意是什麽，我自然也只有走。兩個人便他在前我在後地走着，無言地。可是不久他落。了，落到了我的後面去。在横塘一座新造的橋的邊頭，我還想沿塘一直走，可是他呌住了我。他要我拐　。他說走腹道近。腹道是御道，是砌給什麽皇帝走的。那是他的第一句發言，雖然他已有過一兩個回答。要是他多說話，是會覺得討厭的，我相信，可是儘那樣不說，倒也似乎感到了欠缺。我逗他談了一兩句。我便知道他還得走到光福。他沒有告訴我在那里開店還是種田。［香雪海的梅花開了沒有？］我問道。［香雪海？］他不解。我不曉得從那里看來的那個名稱，大槪在當地並不通行。［玄墓山的？］［］開哉；現在去白相個人蠻興。——倷阿是也要到玄墓山去？］一我也許去。那里有沒有旅館？］（未完）人與魔鬼及神  劉明　　在鄕下人心目中，在槪要以魔鬼爲最可怕的吧？唔唔，不見得，過舊歷新年的時候只要在大門口，貼上兩張威風凛凛　門神，便一家淸吉平安了。因爲他們想像中的魔鬼，是講禮，又很傻瓜，不爬牆，不鑽洞，非門不入的君子，看見紙畫的傢伙，就會逡巡不前了。而且，内地有些地方，在五月端午，呌一名呌化子，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　身穿紅衣，臉塗煤烟，裝成魔鬼，大家則鳴擊鑼，從而追之，鬧得縱横數十里内，雞犬皆驚。當乎假的魔鬼活捉之後，於是，一切躱在暗中的眞實魔鬼，便會，便會全都嚇軟了，逃之大吉。總之，對待魔鬼，鄕下人是很聰明的。那末，神呢？也不見得怕囉！請看田間的土地廟吧，竟然這樣的對聯也有了，［燒酒甜酒都不論，公雞母雞只要肥。一那麽，裏面坐的那位温文爾雅的先生，還成什麽菩薩呢，只不過一個好吃好喝的老頭兒罷了。至於小孫兒生病，老太婆便趕忙拿着三枝香，走到神的面前，喃喃有詞的禱求着，如果保祐好了，說是定要獻上謝禮，神是吃肉的，便許下雄雞一隻，刀頭一個；吃素的呢，就許下豆腐一方，蒸　三個，總之，絶不空口說白話。難道這還不像纳賄一樣的麽？只是神太老實些，並不像官那麽聰明，要暗中打［背手，］表面稱淸高的。虎豹在咬人了，就弄個山神出來，江水在泛濫了，就弄個江神出來，修起廟，穿起金，頂禮膜拜。倘不需要，了，便由牠凋零，破敗，以至倒塌。然而，對待人呢，可不能這麽乾脆了。眞命天子是要的，但無道昏君，却仍然不得不頂在頭上。收稅的皂隸，拉伕的丘八，是很討厭的，但來了的時候，門神自然沒有用，卽使預先關緊大門，也會給你打得稀爛的。難道再呌一名呌化子，裝成皇帝之類的東西，像趕魔鬼似的趕他一塲嗎？鄕下人也知道這已嚇不走，老鴉］了。故鄕下人喟然而嘆曰；［人是比神還難將就，比魔鬼還可怕呵！］萬勝（續）  草明女士　　她講話是那末温和——除了跟　父親或哥哥吵嘴的時候，她對一般人都很和氣，這是她常常露出她那兩個可愛的笑渦的理由。可是有一次她哥哥演了一幕兇殘的戲以後，她就突然變成一匹剛剛跌下獵人底陷阱的猛獸，咆哮，宜暴起來了。事情是這樣發生的；萬勝底父親生病的第五天底中午，她剛從絲廠裏拿了七塊氏錢回來，正打算怎樣分配的時候，她那像狗羣裏吃了敗仗退下來的，眼睛閃耀着金黃的光亮的剛從賭塲回來的哥哥跑進來了。他對妹子手裏的錢眩惑起來，貧婪地笑了一笑。開頭用請求的，繼續用强迫的口氣跟妹子理論，可是無論他怎樣吵閙，她總是把裝在内衣口袋的錢按得緊緊。後來，他被氣惱了，用傢具做起他底武器來。床上的生病的父親底呻吟般的咒駡，也給呌囂的聲音隱　　。終於，他跑到廚房拿了柄菜刀出來，做着兇猛的姿勢對妹子晃。她開始慌張地發脚奔出街心，邊跑邊顫聲呼救着。她跑到河邊的時候，回頭看見那匹啣着刀的野狼就要趕上了，她就一躍跳進水裏。他趕到的時候，馬上撇下了刀，也鑽進水裏了。那時不知所措的路入們才驚覺了似地呼呌着聚攏起來。一會兒，人們還沒動手拯救，那兩個像洗過澡的狗似地——男的抱着妹子扒到岸上來了。女的給人家按着腹部，不住地吐水。她睜開眼的時候，第一個動作就是按了按口袋，然後才打個冷顫說；［算了，讓我去吧，拖我起來幹嗎呢！還不活够了？······］崛强地直挺站着的那匹狼，生氣地對妹子呌起來；［傻瓜，水是好玩的麽？我要的是錢，並不是你底命呀——］終於，他閉着眼睛給兩個鄕勇捉住手臂帶到鄕局戒去了。萬勝非常軟弱地對着病了的父親躺了半天，晚上，她爬起來跑到鄕局長那兒懇求說；［放了他吧，沒有人燒飯哩。而且，還要煎藥給老頭子吃······］她悲傷地搖顫着腦袋走了。第二次絶早，她帶着比從前更蒼白的臉色，跑進工廠裏去。她底温柔完全消失了，笑渦怕跟人會面，老是躱在皮層裏，靈活的眼睛也凝滯起來；嘴裏不是喃喃地咒駡着便是陰鬱地沉思。我幾次想跑到她身邊，說一些她願意聽的話，可是她一見我走近她，就厭煩地嚷起來；［噯，你玩你的吧，不要麻煩我！］這件事發生後的兩個月，她居然從絲廠裏被趕出來了。她一個同伴曾經好意地對她說；［要是你縛緊了肚子，預備挨餓，才可以跟巡工們作對的。一她横蠻地反駡對手沒氣骨；以後，也就沒人眯她！！！這匹瘋狂了的狗。她曾經投過了幾次水，都給人家拖了回來。一個［老耕種］的族叔看不過眼似地說；［這簡直是洗一個澡，你不拖她，她自己也會爬起來的］。不久，她失踪了，人們對於這件事并不覺得奇怪，也不感着趣味。不過，河面始終沒有發現過的她底屍首，所以直到現在，大家都相信那時候她並沒有死去。買書的癖  劉大杰　　癖雖不同，然而人各有癖。有的愛聽梅蘭芳的劇，有的愛玩幾百年前的古董，有的愛抽鴉片，也有的愛看美國女明星梅蕙斯走路時候的屁股，還有專愛胡蝶臉上的笑渦的。有一天，在大美晚報上，登載一節關於我的嗜好的消息，說我愛打牌愛喝酒愛抽烟。抽烟對於我，漸漸地成了癖，這是眞的，打牌喝酒，我雖也歡喜，不過還沒有成癖，只是一種可有可無的小嗜好。朋友來了，大家頑頑，走了，還是自己讀讀書寫寫文章，倒也有趣味。　除了抽烟以外，在我還有一種癖，便是買書。有這種癖的人，據我所知道的，還有林語堂郁達夫潘光旦這幾位先生。我們偶一會見，總是把自己近來買到的她書，搬了出來，好像開展覧會似的，誇耀這裏，誇耀那裏，講的講，笑的笑，極有風趣。這種風趣，也只可爲知者道，不可爲俗人言的。我在日本住了六年半，出入最多的，要算是舊書店。舊書店可以算是我的學校，我的圖書館。東京神田的幾十家書店，我輪流地總跑了千百回。店中的老閶和老閶娘的影子，到現在，還有多少活現在我的眼前。那時，我專收集歐美作家的集子，今天買一册易卜生的海上夫人，明天買一册國民公敵，久而久之，成了一套全集，那時候心靈中的快樂，眞是不容易描摹呢！（未完）鄕村掇拾（二）  風子　　（二）滄桑我們這個村子的名稱是很多的，在從前，寫在筆頭上的是［古塘村，］但鄕下人只知道呌［　里塘］或［畈田塘］；自從ＸＸ風氣傳到鄕村以後，大槪是不能不改革吧，又呌甚麽［ＸＸＸ三姓聯合村]了，但鄕下人却還是要［畈里塘］或［畈田塘］。從名稱上看來，這兒從前是有一條江的，北到南直穿過這個村子，所以現在西面還呌［一西岸邊］，東面也呌［東岸邊］。我家屋後被稱爲［後山門頭］的一帶，該是有座山吧，現在却只能看到一些東歪西斜的屋子。靠西一帶被稱爲［安園］的，全是荒蕪的墳墓，到如今是連白骨都暴露了。當我還是孩子的時候，對這幾個地方，就想下一些研求的工夫；但年齡畢竟還太稚，識字的紳士旣不肯帮我忙，不識字的前輩也要笑我無聊。這願望就一直掛到現在。此番回鄕原爲料理一些家事，和紀念一個難於忘却的傷痛。到家以後，因爲微感不適，心緖又不好，只得讓這個願望依舊掛下去。我存心研求的動機是很偶然的，那時候怕還只十二三歲吧，十二三歲的孩子總愛玩要。除了在家里看看水滸傳和三國演義外，我就常常往田野里奔跑；田野里一年四季不斷地有給孩子們玩的東西，特别是［安園］，那地方有薺菜，有馬蘭頭，有覆盆子；在春天，可以從那兒掘些蚯蚓來釣魚，秋天有蟋蟀可捉，我往那兒去的時候特别多。［安園］里原先是有一塊節孝牌坊的，牌坊上那塊横石標早已不知去向了，只　立著二根石柱。牧童大都在這兒擊牛繩，也常常爬上石柱去，那種把戲我玩不來，我只能在石柱旁邊捉蟋蟀、找油戎蘆，做些發掘工作。那天郤掘著了一塊堅硬的東西，我發現那是一口石磨，約摸有米篩好麽大，七八寸厚，我不曾掘下去，因爲在鄕野找到那些石磨是很通常的事。不久以後，由於這口石磨我聽到了一段傳說。據說在幾十年前，當那　節孝牌坊　不十分壞的時候，每逢陰雨的天氣，常可看見一個穿白衣的女人立在節孝牌坊下，弄得全村都騷然了。後來不知誰出主意，把這口磨去放在那個白衣女人立着的地方，才得安定。因爲　是曆邪的。當我知道那可以採覆盆子捉蟋蟀的所在，正是鬼魅巢穴的時候，不免有些毛髮悚然，但也並不十分相信。以後每逢陰雨的天氣，常常跑上樓去開着後窗遙室，但始終沒有看見過立在牌坊下穿着白衣的女人。隨後幾年，［無鬼論］的信念漸漸堅起來，我料想那是一種附會，並且疑心被稱爲穿白衣的女人就是節考牌坊的主人，也就是［安園］的主人。這主人生前或死後看來，有不少動人聽聞的事件，才會生出遭種無稽的傳說來。爲着想證實這個料想，我才决意要研求一下，不單是［安園］，我們全村子都是一個謎。但有甚麽辦法呢？我自己身上也正壓着口石磨，安園里的石磨一年年向泥土里沉下去，身上的石磨也一年年向我壓下來，我應該儘先解决的是那一口石磨呢？篇中世紀的小說  美國ＭａｒｋＴｗａｉｎ著（尊寒譯）　　（一）天已經晚了。大而且老的克魯根斯坦封建的府第被一片寂靜籠罩着。那時一千二百二十二年快要完結了。在那兒，在那最高的塔頂，映射出惟一的亮光。那兒在開着一個秘密會議。嚴厲的克魯根斯坦老爵爺坐在一張華麗的椅上，在悠然沉思着。一會兒，他以一種温柔的口調說道；［我的女兒！］一個從脚到頭穿着騎士甲胄的，儀容高貴的靑年，回答道；［說罷，父親。］［我的女兒，現在應該把那壓在你整個靑春時代的秘密揭開了。這秘密是發源於我今天所要告訴你的那些事情的。我的哥哥烏爾利蚩是勃郎登堡大公爵。我們的父親臨終時决定；如果烏爾利蚩沒有男性的繼承者時，公爵的爵位便歸到我這一房來，但須我有一個兒子。另外還决定，如果兩人都沒有兒子，而祗有女兒時，那麽爵位將歸烏爾利蚩的女兒繼承，假使她能證明她的名字是純潔無瑕的話，不然，我的女兒便成爲繼承人了，但須她有着無可非難的品行。因此，我的老妻和我，都熱心地祈求神佑，得到一個兒子。可是我們的禱告落空了。你生下來了。我當時非常悲苦。我瞧着財寳從我手中溜走了。堂皇的夢想幻滅了。而我曾那樣希望過來　烏爾利蚩結婚了五年，而他的女人，不曾給他征下任何繼承人，不論男的或女的。［可是，當心啦，我心想，一切還不曾失去。我腦裏描出了一個補救的計劃。你是半晚上誕生的。祇有醫生，奶媽，和六個僕人知道你是女孩。我把他們在一點鐘内一個個地絞死了。天亮時，所有男爵領地内的居民從傳令使的嘴裏聽說克魯根斯坦生了一個兒子，－一個大勃郎登堡的繼承人，都快樂得發狂了。而那秘密是毫不曾洩露的。你的親姨母哺育着你，直到現刻我們不曾有過任何懼慮·······［當你已經有了十歲時，烏爾利蚩生了一個女兒。這事使我們非常難過，可是我們希望天花，醫生，或其他嬰孩時代的自然的仇敵會來帮助我們了結她。唉！我們失望了。她長大且發育起來，這該死的東西啊，但不相干。我們無所用其憂惶。因爲，哈！哈！我們不是有着一個兒子嗎？我們的兒子不是將來的公爵嗎？我們最愛的龔娜，這不是絲毫不錯嗎？因爲你雖是一個二十八歲的女人，我的孩子，却從沒有給過你第二個名稱。［現在，我的哥哥已經達到了衰老的年齡，他的身體也弱了。國家大事已使得他力不能勝，因此他想把你呌去，在沒有取得公爵名稱之前，先執行起公爵的職務。你的隨從已經凖備好了。你今晚就得動身。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言日本妄想獨覇東亞  行安　　日本近日乘世界纷爭擾攘之隙，又放出一烟幕彈，向各國說明牠在東亞處有特殊地位，凡東亞問題，自有牠能獨力治理，警告各國可勿干涉，反對各國有任何援助中國的舉動，嚴然以東亞覇主自居。日本此種言論，已震撼全世界，引起列强强烈的反響，大有迫列强聯合陣線，向日本作總攻之勢。其影響所及，不但足以轉變遠東塲面，亦且可以牽動世界大局。　　查日本此次發出此種驚人謬詞，其用意有五。第一，是想阻止各國對於中國的援助。美國棉麥借欵的成立，和國聯技術合作的實施皆爲日本所不滿。牠洞悉中日兩國的裂痕甚深，今日中國凡事所以容忍屈服，係因國家實力未足使然，將來倘中國一旦强盛，於日本非常不利。牠旣懷此絶大顧忌，自不得不極力反對各國有援助中國的行爲，以阻撓中國的發展。第二，是要向世界伸述其所抱的亞洲門羅主義，以求貫澈其獨覇東亞的迷夢。日本之妄想獨覇東亞，存心已久。只因列强在東亞所佔勢力，亦頗雄厚堅實，一時尙難掃滅，致終未得逞。但牠旣有此野心抱負，自非達到不可，故乘目前歐美各國猜忌對峙，自顧不暇之際，以爲良機已至，乃决然放此危言，以試探各國空氣。第三，日本現時國際間所處地位，已臨於孤立險境。雖狡猾機警的日外交當局，能利用各國弱點，以收其所謂各個擊破的效果，但此不過亦只能渡過暫時的難關，對俄對美的暗礁，尙無法使之解除。日本爲欲應付此危難，自不得不取先發制人之策，故意發此荒謬絶倫的聲明書，恫嚇世界，以冀挽回頽局。第四，其用意在暗示我國，日本乃東亞盟主，凡東亞之事，唯日本馬首是瞻，非外人所能置喙過問，呌中國不可接受列强的援助，呌中國不可再結好外人，而須置身於日本支配之下。第五，日本之陰謀侵呑我國，並不以東北四省爲滿足，大有席捲整個中國領土之槪。故此聲明書，亦可視爲將來踐踏我國的先聲。　　但日本自發此露骨表示之後，國際形勢，頓然爲之一變。歐美各國政府，對此均異常重視。各國有力者，已先後起而加以嚴詞的質問。國際輿讑，亦皆憤慨激昻，作强硬論調，痛加抨擊。雖廣田鑒於世界空氣的緊張，迅圖轉　，極力爲各國解釋，謂日本此舉，實無心違反門户開放和機會均等的主張，亦無侵犯現行條約，搖動外人旣得利權之意，以冀緩和各國對日情感之惡化，但日本奸計，早爲世人所明瞭，空言搪塞，益足增人嫌恨，時下戒心。軟弱無能的我國，對此亦不願默然而息，前日已發出反駁書，以表白我國的立塲。我知日本苟不思退讓，一意逞强孤行，世界各國，當不至永持縱容的態度，必羣起而監視制裁之。　　時至今日，最堪憂慮者，卽中國自身的立塲。我人對於日本此種狂妄行爲，始終抱反對的决心。中國亦一獨立國家，舉凡對内對外一切事宜，皆得以自己的主權處理之，非任何人所能越俎代庖，亦非任何人所能干涉牽制。中國更不願任何人以殖民地或保護國視之。中國亦不欲處任何人的指揮下，認任何人爲盟主。凡以平等對待中國，有誠意和中國表示親善者，中國亦願以平等對待之，而誠意與之締結親善。關於各國互助，此乃國際間應有的道義，中國願援助他國，亦甚願他國之與以援助。但此亦只限於促進國家發展的援助，若帶有侵略性質的援助，中國亦不願接受而要加以拒絶。至若我國今日遇事之所以委曲求全，非以示弱，實國力微薄有以致之。我人對於任何主權上的損失，只視爲一種强制的掠奪，將來對於主權的收回，尙抱有絶大的希望。</p>

<p>(Washington) Today, ambassadors of various countries and State Department officials repeatedly held important meetings here to discuss the Far Eastern situation and the attitude to be taken by the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. Invited by the State Department for talks were British Ambassador Lindsay, Chinese Minister Shi Zhaoji, Italian Ambassador Rosso, French Ambassador Laboulaye, and Dutch Minister De Wees, among other diplomatic officials. The results of their discussions will serve as the basis for a meeting between President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull. The meeting between the President and the Secretary of State was originally scheduled for today but has been postponed to tomorrow to allow for the exchange of views among the diplomatic representatives of the Nine-Power Treaty countries. Well-informed sources believe that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull will issue a concrete declaration after their meeting, clarifying the policy of the American government. At the same time, Secretary of the Navy Swanson declared that he hopes to allocate US$32 million from public works project funds to implement a naval replenishment plan, of which US$27 million will be used to build new ships to replace outdated destroyers and submarines, and the remaining US$5 million will be used to build aircraft carriers. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Although the U.S. State Department is extremely concerned about the developments in the Far East, it believes that the time is not yet ripe to issue a concrete declaration because the situation is too complex. It is reported that before receiving a definite response from Japan on this issue, the American note to Japan will be temporarily delayed. Japan has not only issued declarations in Tokyo but has also disseminated various statements in Geneva, Berlin, and Washington, the words of which are slightly contradictory, further confusing the situation.

<h3 id="e2">Minister Jiang Meets Hirota; Hirota Uses Sweet Words to Conceal Ambitions; Claims Willingness for Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Chinese Minister to Tokyo Jiang Zuobin today visited Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota to explain the contents of the informal statement issued in Nanjing yesterday and asked Hirota to explain the intentions of the Japanese government regarding the statement on China policy issued by Japan on April 17. Hirota claimed that Japan was quite uneasy because it had recently heard news that various countries were selling munitions and supplying military advisors to China, as such actions were not in line with the spirit of cooperation to promote peace in the Far East. The spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, in light of this, believed it was appropriate to clarify the previously issued and widely acknowledged Japanese attitude in a timely manner. This statement was issued to the press but has surprisingly caused much misunderstanding overseas, which is quite alarming. China is currently displaying a sentiment that is unpleasant to the Japanese, and China is even issuing a warning, ordering the entire nation to prepare for the events of 1936. Some of the wording in the Japanese statement may seem harsh, but the Japanese government intends to support its substance and spirit, so Japan hopes that the attitude of the Chinese government and public will match the spirit of cooperation. Minister Jiang then replied that China was not planning any actions to prepare for the events of 1936. Hirota continued, saying that the Japanese government would give appropriate respect to the interests of all countries in China and supports any attempts to develop China's natural resources. The Japanese government will, of course, be cautious not to fail to respect the sovereignty of the Republic of China. Japan has no intention of infringing upon China's sovereignty under any circumstances. Observers may suspect that Japan is violating the Open Door Policy, but in fact, Japan is extremely eager to abide by this [international principle], as Japan has suffered greatly from boycotts, and these boycotts are a true violation of the Open Door Policy and the principle of equal opportunity. If international assistance to China creates unforeseen adverse situations, the consequences felt by Japan will be the most painful. If this happens, China will inevitably make harmful and unjust criticisms of Japan, damaging the future of peace in the Far East. Japan, in this situation, will oppose any assistance to China that is not well-intentioned. Japan cannot be held responsible for the failure of harmful assistance to China, so it hopes that China will consider the importance of bearing the responsibility of maintaining peace in the Far East alongside Japan and consult with Japan in advance. Hirota also earnestly stated that since he took office as Foreign Minister, he has strived to improve relations between Japan and its closest neighbors. In recent times, relations between China and Japan have greatly improved. Before leaving China this time, Japanese Minister Ariyoshi visited the leaders of the government, predicting that he would return to Tokyo with good results. Hirota finally told Minister Jiang that once the negotiations between Manchuria and Russia regarding the China Eastern Railway are concluded, the Japanese government is willing to have direct negotiations between China and Japan to resolve various outstanding issues, as the speedy resolution of all issues is extremely important to the Far East.

<p>(Oriental) American Ambassador Grew visited Foreign Minister Hirota Hisashi at 12:30 PM today to question Japan's policy against foreign aid to China. The two sides talked for a long time. It is understood that Ambassador Grew's actions are based on the instructions of the Washington State Department and are of the same nature as yesterday's visit by British Ambassador Lindsay to Foreign Minister Hirota.

<p>(London) According to informed sources today, the government is preparing to issue a declaration on Monday to clarify Britain's attitude towards Japan's new Far Eastern policy. The form of the declaration may be a statement made by Foreign Secretary Simon in the House of Commons. At this time, the Foreign Office is studying in detail the report submitted by Ambassador Lindsay in Japan after his talks with Foreign Minister Hirota yesterday. As for the talks between Ambassador Lindsay in the United States and the U.S. State Department, London has also received a report and will study it before Monday. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Sir Arthur Salter, who previously traveled to China and served as a financial advisor to the National Economic Council of China, told a reporter from the Morning Post today that the visit of European economic experts to China should definitely not be seen as having anti-Japanese overtones. He and French expert Monnet did not propose that Japan should not be allowed to participate equally in international cooperation with China. As for the issue of special status, that is, of course, another matter. In fact, they only studied the possibilities and did not enter the stage of loan plans or special international cooperation plans. It is reported that Salter will submit another report to the Chinese government, which will be published soon, and will further clarify the nature of his recommendations to the Chinese government.

<p>Minister Ariyoshi and his party left for Beijing by train at 2:10 PM this afternoon. The Minister made the following remarks to reporters upon departure:</p>
<p>I have not returned home since Foreign Minister Hirota took office. This return is to report on affairs and discuss everything. I believe that the informal statement from the Foreign Ministry the other day should not impede Chinese sentiments. Some say that China is jealous of Foreign Minister Hirota's work with the United States, but the fact is that some welcome Sino-Japanese harmony with goodwill for peace in East Asia. However, outstanding issues between China and Japan are still numerous, but no matter who they are, they cannot be easily resolved and should be handled gradually. (Dentsu Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">The London Times; Great Opinion Advises Japan; If Japan Wishes to Eliminate Self-Made Calamities; It Must Abandon the Arrogance of the Era of Seclusion; Famous Opinion Circulated Widely in Various Circles <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(London) Today's Times editorial stated that Japan's political and economic importance in its relations with China and its geographical position are recognized by the world. Japan naturally occupies an important position in any conference regarding Chinese affairs, but this is no reason to demand exclusive influence. What is causing the world anxiety now is that Japan brazenly makes this demand, and its arrogant attitude is reminiscent of its era of self-imposed seclusion. The Japanese government now seems to want to alleviate the anxiety caused by its spokesperson. If Japan cooperates with other civilized countries instead of conflicting with them, it can achieve its goal of easing world tensions and have its views on Chinese affairs heard by other countries. If Japan wants to do this, Prime Minister Saito should recruit experts on Chinese affairs and, when hoping for the progress, stability, and independence of the Republic of China, not only think in material terms. Before hearing Japan's China policy, it is indeed inconvenient to immediately condemn its policy. Presuming that what makes the Japanese government uneasy is the instability of Chinese politics, but the Chinese situation has improved recently. It would be ridiculous to say that the Chinese army is dangerous or that American policy is inciting China and Russia to declare war on Japan. Britain's policy in the Pacific is to maintain its old friendship with Japan while helping the development of peace and order in China. General restrictions on the arms trade with China can only be achieved through collective action by the great powers. A declaration that disregards the efforts of the Chinese authorities to restore order within their territory or disregards the legitimate rights and interests of Britain and other countries cannot achieve this goal. It is inevitable that the Japanese declaration has caused worldwide anxiety, as the nature of its negation and the extraordinary informal method of its publication are all startling. Remarks by Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito, Ambassador to Germany Nagai, and Prime Minister Hirota, such as saying that providing loans and selling aircraft to China would endanger Japan, should be known that those familiar with the Chinese situation and Japan's military facilities in China believe that this danger is still far away, especially since the Japanese government has already decided to double its air force. The remarks of the Japanese ambassadors to the United States and Germany raise suspicions that Japan will again see the current difficulties in Europe and the United States as opportunities. From the perspective of recent Far Eastern history, these suspicions are indeed justified. When the European War of 1915 was in full swing and the United States was about to join the war, Japan put forward its world-famous Twenty-One Demands. A few years ago, Japan took advantage of the economic panic in Europe and the United States to send troops to China and seize Manchuria. Now that European diplomats are fighting for disarmament issues and the United States is working on the recovery of its national life, Japan seems to be taking advantage of this opportunity again to make its even grander demands and wants to control financial, commercial, shipping, and cultural relations on a very large scale. Hong Kong is one of the most prosperous commercial ports in the Far East, and its university is now dedicated to the education of Chinese youth. Foreign ships flying the British flag account for one-third of the ships coming to and from Chinese ports. There is hardly a province in China that does not have British investment. The United States also has very large trade relations with China, and American education is also beneficial to Chinese youth. In Shanghai, British investment is three and a half times more than Japanese investment. In mainland China, British investment reaches £197,000,000, accounting for 56% of total foreign investment, while Japanese investment is only £74,000,000, accounting for 21% of the total. American investment is also £32,000,000, accounting for 9% of the total. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Minister Gu Breaks With the Japanese and American Monroe Doctrines; Truly the Difference Between a Jackal and a Guard Dog; Japanese Navy Ranks Third in the World; Army is Twice as Large as Britain or America; Saying It is Threatened by China is Ridiculous <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Chinese Minister to France Dr. Gu Weijun met with the American press yesterday and made the following remarks. Gu said that Japan's intention to control relations between China and various countries has aroused the anger of China and the censure of Europe and the United States. This attempt has exposed its ambition to dominate the east coast of the Pacific and shows the origin of the threat to peace in the Far East. Although its declaration does not contain a judgment to annex China, its determination to undermine China's independent sovereignty and its efforts to make China its dependency, so as to control China's resources and trade, are obvious. The most bizarre thing is that Japan once created the idea of an [Asian Monroe Doctrine]. If its so-called Monroe Doctrine is compared with the American Monroe Doctrine, it is truly the difference between a jackal and a guard dog. If Japan truly takes peace in the Far East as a premise, an effective remedy is not difficult to find, namely, referring to the Nine-Power Treaty, as the Nine-Power Treaty stipulates a very simple solution, namely, discussing the issues to be discussed among the various allied countries. Japan now has the third-largest navy in the world, and its standing army is twice as large as that of the United States or Britain, so it is ridiculous to say that it is threatened by China, which is known for its love of peace. Therefore, Japan intends to dominate the Pacific and implement the doctrine that might makes right, which is based on its well-trained army. Now China has no other aspirations than to urgently carry out its national construction and share the work of building world prosperity. If other countries have no ambitious intentions towards China, there is no need to fear that China will become a unified and strong country. China is now an independent country and is on the path of construction, which will not only not hinder Japan and the peace of the Far East but will also be of great benefit to the investment of various countries in the world. (World News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Times' honest and reasonable editorial has been widely circulated in political and diplomatic circles. The newspaper's comments can indeed represent the general public opinion here. All Liberal and Labor parties that oppose Japan's imperialist policy and Conservative parties that have not forgotten the Anglo-Japanese alliance sympathize with this argument. The newspaper has always supported the government and is extremely friendly to Japan, so its remarks are especially valued. (Reuters, 26th)</p>

<p>(London) Chinese Minister to Britain Guo Taiqi gave an interview to a Havas reporter, saying that [the declaration of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's spokesperson has been approved by the cabinet, and Japan's attempt to control the Far East has taken another step forward. Japanese policy focuses on strength and war, and there are reasons for this in its national psychology. Because Japan has always won every war, its territory has never been invaded, and its people have come to regard war as beneficial and valuable. Japan's policy of external expansion is a violation of the Nine-Power Treaty, as evidenced by its occupation of Manchuria and the construction of fortifications on the islands it administers in the Pacific. There is no force in the Far East to stop Japan's development. China's military strength is insufficient, and its financial resources are inadequate, so it is unable to resist Japanese invasion. It must be known that as a result of Japan's external expansion, the entire country of China will be invaded, and the commerce of Western countries will also be bankrupted. Therefore, countries either do not want to stop Japan's development, or they must rise up and take action. As for the American cotton and wheat loans, some of them are used for economic recovery projects, but China is an autonomous country, and foreign loans, no matter what they are used for, have the right to be autonomous, without the labor of others to intervene. Japan's intervention in China's financial policy disregards China's autonomy and is in serious violation of the Nine-Power Treaty.] (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e9">Minister Hu's Declaration; Japan Hinders Our Revival; Implements the Second Section of the Tanaka Memorial; Wants Asia to Belong to the Japanese <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese Minister to Switzerland Hu Shize told reporters today that Japan is now implementing the second section of the Tanaka Memorial. The Japanese do not want Asia to be Asia for Asians, but Asia for the Japanese, so it is different from the Monroe Doctrine. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Hu Shize, the head of the Chinese delegation's office at the League of Nations and the Minister to Switzerland, issued a declaration to the press, refuting the declaration of Yokoyama, the Japanese Consul General in Geneva, stating that [the declaration issued by the Japanese representative in Geneva on April 23 proves that Japan has a plan to dominate Asia and the Pacific, making Japan's ambitions even more obvious. Japan's intention is to seize the right to completely monitor China and wants to interfere in China's internal affairs and its relations with the League of Nations or the great powers, and it is not limited to Manchuria. Japan claims to be cooperating fully with China, but it does not know that there is no country that is more willing to coordinate with the international community for peace than China. There is only one thing that makes people suspicious, namely, is it possible to regard the seizure of several provinces from a country's territory, separating them from their motherland, as an expression of mutual sincerity and understanding? The Japanese representative also spoke of peace and unity in China. Since the Shenyang Incident in September 1931, international tragedies have been pressing in, and the people of the country are heartbroken and united in good faith. The cause of unity has made great progress, and China is requesting technical cooperation from the League of Nations for peaceful construction to cope with economic and other difficulties and to engage in construction. China, as a member of the League of Nations, recognizes its obligation to promote international cooperation. China's prosperity will increase its purchasing power, and the products of other countries can be absorbed by China. However, judging from the meaning of the Japanese representative's statement, what Japan is worried about is precisely China's prosperity and the fact that China is opening its doors to commerce, so it obstructs it by claiming that China's cooperation with the international community is dangerous. However, there can be no danger in Sino-foreign cooperation. Japan wants to be the sole judge of what kind of foreign aid to China is harmful to the maintenance of peace and order and sufficient to disturb it. In fact, Japan wants to establish a special position in China, and this position is incompatible with Chinese sovereignty and international treaties and is especially sufficient to undermine the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. Japan wants to hinder China's revival and obstruct international cooperation with China, and its declaration takes the maintenance of peace as a pretext, but it does not know that it has been destroying peace for three years now. In the past, Japan said that its actions in Manchuria did not violate the League of Nations Covenant, and it also said that the establishment of [Manchukuo] was based on the public will of the people of Manchuria. The value of this Japanese declaration is no more than equal to the previous two statements.] (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>(Paris) According to reliable sources, the French government's policy towards the situation in the Far East has not yet been expressed, but it will insist that Japan strictly abide by its responsibility to comply with international covenants.

<p>(Washington) Today, several senior naval officers here stated that Japan's declaration rejecting assistance to China from various countries happened to occur at the same time as the return of the U.S. fleet to the Atlantic, so there is reason to be suspicious. It is said that Japan's occupation of Manchuria in 1931 also occurred two days after the British fleet mutinied overseas in Scotland. This time, Japan's declaration was issued at a time when the U.S. fleet was sailing to the Caribbean and the Atlantic for exercises and had arrived in Panama. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull are scheduled to hold a meeting on the situation at the White House today. Before meeting with President Roosevelt, the Secretary of State had a lengthy talk with Shi Zhaoji, the Chinese Minister to the United States, but the content of the talk was not disclosed. It is understood that the talks between Hull and Shi Zhaoji, in addition to giving China some guarantees, did not involve anything else. As for the news from Beijing that the Chinese government spokesperson claimed in a broadcast speech that the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty have guaranteed China to maintain the treaty and oppose Japan's hegemony in Asia, State Department officials are unwilling to express their opinions on this, but they regard Japan's declaration as the most serious political development since Japan presented the Twenty-One Demands to China in 1914. It is believed that Hull and President Roosevelt will issue a declaration after their meeting, clarifying the policy of the United States. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e13">Japan Seeks Special Status in the Far East; Russia Believes the Great Powers Cannot Ignore It; China is Extremely Related to Various Countries; This Time It Must Not Shirk Its Responsibility <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russia believes that Japan's warning to the great powers has made relations between Japan and the United States more strained and has made the Tokyo military control the government. A famous report believes that Japan's warning has two effects: (1) It attempts to break up the negotiations between China and the international banking syndicate currently in Nanjing. The Japanese military regards this as part of a plan by the European powers and the United States to form a common front to resist Japan's flood of Asian policies. (2) Japan is trying to force Nanjing to stop negotiations with the United States regarding the construction of aircraft. As for Soviet Russia itself, it is naturally wary of the rise of the Japanese military, because they have a plan to seize Soviet Russian territory. It is generally believed that the tension between Russia and Japan, which has recently been dormant, may now be awakened because of this. The Russian capital sees Japan's recent actions as the same trick as when it presented the Twenty-One Demands in 1915 and seized Manchuria in 1931, because at both of these times, the Western powers were too busy with domestic affairs to take care of foreign affairs. The opinion of the Russian authorities is that China's security and progress, as well as peace in the Far East, are all extremely related to other countries. It would be foolish to ignore Japan's special status in the Far East, and increasing peace in the Far East should still be a matter of cooperation among the countries concerned, and especially the reconciliation of Sino-Japanese disputes. The Western countries cannot shirk their responsibility in the Far East this time. (Reuters, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e14">A Word on Developing the Northwest <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Recently, those responsible for politics in our country have mostly been able to focus on the promotion and reform of internal affairs, the advantages and disadvantages of material construction. It has gradually moved from the stage of publicity to the stage of implementation. At this time of serious national crisis and the pressure from powerful neighbors, it can indeed be called a good sign. Recently, such as Song Ziwen, the chairman of the Economic Commission, inspecting the Northwest, and Dai Chuanxian, the president of the Examination Yuan, touring Shaanxi and Gansu, both have far-sighted vision. However, the development of the Northwest has been advocated by the people of the country for several years, and so far there have been no significant achievements. On the contrary, the people of the Northwest have become more and more impoverished. For example, in the Hetao area, after the ravages of war, the fertile land has become barren. In Shaanxi and Gansu, famine is a disaster, and children are regarded as strangers. In Xinjiang, wars are frequent, and hidden dangers are numerous. In Kangzang, political and religious conflicts are not harmonious, and beacon fires rise from time to time. In Sichuan, the Communist Party is causing trouble, and many people are displaced. It can be seen that although the call for developing the Northwest is loud, there are many obstacles ahead, and it is not easy to seek quick results.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, the Northwest is a relatively backward region. It has repeatedly suffered from natural and man-made disasters in recent years, and its vitality has almost been destroyed. The people's ability to regenerate themselves is still extremely weak, and it is even more difficult to engage in development. Because the Northwest is located in a remote border area, with a vast territory and sparse population after several periods of turmoil, there are some difficulties in managing agriculture, and it is even more difficult to develop industry. The local military and political authorities only care about their own immediate private interests and do not pay much attention to the hardships of the people's livelihood. Therefore, the rich become poorer and poorer, and the poor have no place to stand. Coupled with obstructed transportation, economic development is very slow, and the people's knowledge is very low. All these factors have a significant impact on the entire Northwest. In short, when it comes to developing the Northwest today, there are several things that deserve the most attention. (1) How to provide the necessary tools for developing the Northwest. This kind of supply should not be limited to money alone. The development is impossible without a large amount of money. At this time of revival from ruins, the concentration of manpower is also an urgent task. The so-called manpower does not only refer to the mentally laborious talents, and general labor talents are also necessary. For example, if the population in the Hetao area is only 50,000, how can they cultivate more than 30,000 square miles of land? The phenomenon of sparse population in Gansu, Xinjiang and other provinces is even more serious. Immigration and garrisoning should not be delayed any longer. The population in the southeastern provinces is excessive, and it seems that they can be moved to the Northwest to make adjustments. However, the climate and living habits in the two places are very different, and the reclamation plan can only be promoted nearby. For example, driving the people of Sichuan and Shaanxi to colonize Gansu and Xinjiang is cheaper in terms of customs, habits and economic organization. (2) In the northwestern provinces, except for Sichuan and Shaanxi, most of them still preserve the economic form of the pastoral era, and handicrafts are not very developed. It will be difficult for them to cope with today's environment. In areas such as Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, strong neighbors are watching around, and the danger is even greater. Therefore, political measures are more urgent than economic construction. (3) The development of the Northwest cannot but make full use of modern machines. However, before using machines to develop industry, the first thing to know is to study the ability of local handicrafts, and the second is to consider whether it is a productive undertaking that is beneficial to the local people's livelihood. China establishes the nation through agriculture. The Northwest is a vast agricultural and pastoral field. Do not cause the decline and bankruptcy of rural areas due to the deformed development of industry. (4) Reorganizing national defense should not be based solely on military power, but on the entire national economic power. The national defense of the Northwest cannot rely solely on the power of one corner of the Northwest. However, if the development can be successful, it will not only contribute to the national economic power, but also benefit national defense.</p>

<p>(Tianjin) At 2:00 PM today, the Tianjin Public Security Bureau convened the officials of each district and precinct in Nanshi to the bureau for a meeting to discuss and decide on measures to maintain security. Starting on the night of the 25th, the posts on our side near the Japanese Concession in Nanshi have been replaced with large guns and increased to two people. The police in the 6th Precinct of the 1st District and the 6th Precinct of the 2nd District are on high alert. Armored vehicles of the Public Security Bureau are also patrolling in that area. The team was disbanded at 6:00 AM on the 26th. The guard posts still carried large guns until late at night to prevent unexpected events. At noon on the 26th, Yan, the chief of the 1st District, visited the police chief of the Japanese Concession and requested that they jointly maintain security at the junction of Nanshi and Haiguang Temple, and asked them to investigate and arrest the criminals who wounded the police and seized their guns. The chief of the Japanese Police Station agreed to investigate and detect the whereabouts of the guns. Liu Kuiqing, the policeman of the 6th Precinct of the 1st District who was wounded on the morning of the 25th, has been transferred to Ma Doctor's Hospital for treatment and is expected to save his life. Recently, there have been many rumors in Tianjin, and it is generally believed that this incident has a large background. The authorities believe that it is a traitor who is undermining security, so they are taking a calm attitude. Yu Xuezhong heard the report in Beiping and has telegraphed Li Junxiang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to properly secure the local defense. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In the kidnapping case in front of the Guangdong School in the French Concession, the Japanese Police Station captured the bandit leader Gao and two others this afternoon.

<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong returned to Tianjin by car with his guards at noon on the 26th.

(2) The training of the formal security team in the war zone will be completed soon, and it will be able to enter the war zone within a month. (3) There is still no result on the issue of receiving Malanyu.

The Japanese recruitment agency for Chinese laborers is located in the concession. Anyone who recruits Chinese laborers through the Chinese territory will be disbanded. In recent days, it has been rare to see them in the city. These workers mostly leave the country through the countryside.

<p>(Beiping) He Jingwu returned to Beiping from Mongolia at 6:40 PM on the 26th and is scheduled to visit He in the morning of the 27th to report on his experience. He said that the Mongolian Political Council held its inaugural meeting as scheduled on the 23rd, with 12 committee members and 8 representatives present. At the same time, the swearing-in ceremony for each committee was held. Prince Yun presided over the ceremony, and all the committee members raised their right hands to take the oath. He personally represented the Central Government and the National Government Chairman Lin to supervise the oath. After the ceremony, the entire Political Council held a meeting to welcome him. At that time, he hung the plaques presented by Lin, Wang, and He to the Mongolian Political Council in the meeting place. On the 24th, he went to various Mongolian villages to inspect. On the 25th, he returned east. Bai Yunti and others stayed at the temple to discuss the future methods of the council. He will be able to return to Beiping within three to five days. After the establishment of the Mongolian Political Council, he will report the process by telegram. Prince Yun also gave him a personal letter to convey his gratitude to the Central Government and He. (26th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Jingwu published his impressions of Mongolia on the evening of the 26th, saying that both Outer Mongolia and Eastern Mongolia have been lost, and now only Xilin Gol League and Western Mongolia remain, with an area of about 5-6 million square miles. The Japanese intelligence agency in Dolon is always trying to get Mongolia. This time, he personally went to Mongolia and felt that to preserve Mongolia, everyone must rise up to study and use the power of the government and society to support it. The 200,000 Mongolian compatriots are serving as the frontier of national defense. This time, he got the impression that there was no time when he was not in danger of being overthrown. (2) Mongolian transportation is centered on Bai Temple, 1,200 miles east to Zhangjiakou, 600 miles east to the Prince De's Mansion near Pangjiang, 600 miles east to Dolon, and about 1,500-1,600 miles west to Ningxia Alxa Banner. The northern border of Outer Mongolia is no more than 600 miles away. The vast grassland can be accessed by cars everywhere. Japan has assembled 100-200 armed vehicles in Dolon, which can ravage the entire Mongolia in a week and complete its dream of a Manchurian-Mongolian empire. (2) The Mongolian system still follows the old system of the Qing Dynasty. This time, Prince De and others felt the danger of being overthrown and began to demand autonomy. However, whether they will have the power to express themselves in the future depends on whether the committee members can unite and become aware. However, it is a question of whether the various banners that have never had political organization can support the critical situation once they are responsible for important tasks. The only task of the Political Council in the future lies in the efforts of the committee members themselves. The league banner political system has not yet taken shape, and the Central Government should generously recognize that it needs assistance and guidance, and should no longer abandon it as before and let it grow and die on its own. Social intellectuals should also form associations to support the Mongolian compatriots. (3) The Mongolian population is at most 200,000. In addition to lamas, women, the elderly and children, there are only 60,000 young men. The reasons for the decline in population are: one is that there are too many lamas, and the other is that the death rate is alarming. Venereal diseases are harmful and should be restricted to religious beliefs and strive for hygiene. (4) Mongolia is still in the nomadic era. Although industry is not developed, it is not without writers. If it is connected with the interior, the economy can also be developed and industry can also be improved. His final hope is that (1) the committee members of the Political Council will unite sincerely and promote Mongolia with all their strength; (2) the government should support Inner Mongolia with economic strength; (3) the society should form groups or specialized research groups to help Mongolia with collective strength.

<p>In India, orthodox Hindu followers strongly opposed Gandhi's propaganda for the "untouchables." Today, when Gandhi was traveling by car, the followers smashed a window. Gandhi was not injured, but three of his reformist volunteers were seriously injured. Gandhi then declared that if his followers committed any faults, he would perform acts of repentance.

<p>Today in Baksa, India, a crowd of thugs suddenly attacked Gandhi's group near the outskirts of the holy city of Baksa. Gandhi himself escaped injury, but three companions were seriously injured and are now receiving medical treatment. The frail Gandhi, still wearing his steel-rimmed glasses, bravely resisted the thugs' attacks. This unfortunate event occurred when Gandhi and his followers were traveling by car, engaged in a movement to liberate the "untouchables" class. Suddenly, a large group of thugs, reportedly led by Hindu followers, surrounded the car and attacked it with iron rulers and wooden sticks, or threw rocks into the car. Initially, the driver tried to escape by driving quickly, but it was ultimately ineffective, resulting in this misfortune. It is also a rare event that no one died. Gandhi later expressed that he would deeply regret it, and his followers believed that the Mahatma might fast, which would be a fatal blow to his weak body. (26th National Telegraph)</p>

<p>Following the resignation of the Lerroux cabinet in Madrid today, political turmoil is developing. This is the seventh political crisis since the collapse of the Spanish Empire. Lerroux's resignation was triggered by President Zamora's attitude of approving the amnesty bill under protest. The President's strongest objection to the bill was the release of 8,000 political prisoners, including thousands of bandits. The police are already struggling to suppress riots today. If the bandits are released, it will further increase the burden on the police. The news of the government's resignation has caused great unrest in political circles. To prevent disturbances, a state of alert has been declared tonight. This is a mild form of martial law. Parliament officially closed after the cabinet crisis occurred. The scene at the time was very chaotic. While the parliamentarians were speaking loudly, the monarchist Maura jumped up and shouted, "Long live the monarchy!" "May it exist forever!" The opposition party unanimously shouted "Long live the Republic!" to drown out Maura's voice. (25th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>With the resignation of the Lerroux cabinet, political turmoil has erupted again. Spanish politicians believe that there are only two ways to resolve the situation: (1) dissolve Parliament; (2) Lerroux would still be responsible for forming a cabinet. President Zamora expressed his opposition to dissolving Parliament, saying that it could lead to civil war, and supported Lerroux's re-forming of a cabinet. (25th Havas Telegraph)</p>

<h3 id="e42">Shifting Clouds in the Far East; US Naval Expansion Cannot Be Delayed; Roosevelt Plans to Request Congressional Appropriations; Vinson Act to be Implemented Soon <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The Vinson Naval Construction Act, which stipulates the construction of 102 warships and 1,184 aircraft, has been passed by both houses of Congress and signed by President Roosevelt on March 27. This law only authorizes the construction of warships in principle. The necessary funding has not yet been discussed. Recently, Roosevelt declared that he plans to request Congress to allocate funds from the public works budget to quickly implement the Vinson Naval Act. The amount of funding requested is undetermined. Roosevelt intends to request $32 million in the fiscal year beginning July 1 of this year to begin construction of 12 destroyers and 6 submarines. The destroyers are intended to replace old ships that have reached the end of their service life. It should be noted that the Vinson Naval Act is completely separate from another naval act passed by Congress last autumn and should not be confused. The naval act passed last autumn allocated a budget of $275 million, also funded by the public works budget, for the construction of two aircraft carriers, one heavy cruiser, three light cruisers, four submarines, and 23 destroyers. Construction of this batch of ships has already begun, and they are all intended to replace old ships. Secretary of the Navy Swanson said that $32 million in funding for the Vinson Naval Act could start construction. Some sources say that Roosevelt's request for Congress to allocate funds to implement the Vinson Naval Act is due to Japan's attitude. If the Vinson Naval Act is implemented, it will be built in stages, with the final batch beginning construction in 1939. Furthermore, a naval conference will be convened next year, which may, as Roosevelt hopes, lead to countries agreeing to limit their navies. This aspect was also taken into consideration when drafting the Vinson Naval Act, so the number of ships built each year was carefully determined to ensure that ships under construction would not be abandoned midway due to a naval conference resulting in limitations on naval construction.

The efforts of the canal authorities were not small. (25th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) With the entire U.S. fleet having safely arrived in the Atlantic Ocean within 47 hours, the authorities are proceeding with arrangements for President Roosevelt to hold a naval review on the Hudson River. At the same time, President Roosevelt will ask Congress in a supplementary appropriations bill to authorize him to start building warships as he deems appropriate, up to the limits allowed by the treaty, which is expected to require 150 million yuan. President Roosevelt has not yet decided how many of the 100 new ships Congress has approved to build at this time, but he wants to have the authority to use part of this funding to build a certain number.

<p>Rome. Italy possesses vast overseas colonies, but does not intend to participate in the prevailing naval competition. Mussolini's intention, although in principle demanding equality with the French navy, it is questionable whether Italy will implement this principle. The Italian-French naval standoff is intended to prevent each other from joining the 1930 British, American, and Japanese naval treaty. Months ago, government authorities declared that they would suspend the 1934 warship building plan. Since then there has been no movement, while France recently decided to start building new warships, including a second-ranked large cruiser with a displacement of 23,000 tons. Italy's naval budget for 1934-1935 is 1,224,780,477 lire, a decrease of 172,441,800 lire from last year, but the value of the US dollar plummeted last year, and the price of the Italian currency is higher than that of the US currency. Currently, each lira is worth about 8.5 US cents, while a year ago it was only worth 5 cents. According to Italian naval authorities speaking to an Associated Press reporter, Italy's naval budget for 1934-35 will be used to maintain the existing fleet and expand naval ports to increase efficiency. Today, Italy's naval policy is only to build new ships to replace old ones, and not to increase the strength and number of the navy. Italy's naval strength includes 2,440 officers and 50,000 soldiers, lower than Britain, the United States, Japan, and France. A list is given below: Two battleships (two others destroyed), two old ironclad cruisers (two others destroyed), six large cruisers, eleven small cruisers (six others under construction), twenty scout ships (large destroyers), thirty-five destroyers, thirty-seven torpedo boats, thirty-one coastal torpedo boats, fifty-five submarines (seven others under construction), one aircraft carrier, seventeen minelayers, thirty-nine minesweepers, nineteen gunboats, forty-three torpedo boat hunters (nine others under construction), and five ironclad gunboats. As for torpedo boat hunters, these are small boats and are not permanently listed. (26th National Telegraph)</p>

<h3 id="e49">American Congressional Silver Faction; Preparing to Duel with Roosevelt; Supporting Compulsory Silver Bill to Raise Silver Prices; Trying Again to Override Presidential Veto <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The silver faction of the House Banking and Currency Committee has now taken action rather than just talking. Today, it took steps to favor the Goldborough Act and the Schullenham Amendment report, forcing the President to find ways to raise silver prices. During a meeting of the Congressional Silver Faction yesterday, it was decided to support the compulsory silver bill rather than the mobile silver bill, hence the vigorous action today. The Goldborough Act advocates the establishment of a Federal Currency Administration to replace the Federal Reserve Bank and manage the issuance of currency. After the committee amended the bill, the Currency Administration would have the power to buy and sell silver, with the goal of keeping the price of 371 and one-quarter cents of silver equal to 23 and 33 hundredths of a cent of pure gold. The Schullenham Amendment stipulates that the Currency Administration is authorized to purchase 50,000,000 ounces of silver per month until 1,000,000,000 ounces have been purchased or the gold-silver ratio reaches 16 to 1. During a meeting between President Roosevelt and congressional silver leaders on April 20, he strongly opposed the wholesale purchase of silver to raise prices through various plans. However, the silver leaders are confident that there is sufficient power in both the House and Senate to pass the bill and amendment. They are also well aware that a two-thirds majority is required to override the President's veto. However, since Congress has already overridden the President's veto of the independent agency funding bill, the silver leaders believe that once they have done it once, they might as well try again and fight a worthwhile battle for silver. The House has already passed the Dies Act by a large majority and sent it to the Senate Committee. The silver faction in the Senate now plans to propose an amendment to nationalize silver.

After Dai got off the train, he crossed the river into the city and returned to the Examination Yuan's official residence to rest and organize the inspection documents, preparing to draft an inspection report and submit it to the National Government within a few days, along with his opinions, as a reference for planning the development of the Northwest. He also has inspection notes that will be sent to various newspapers for publication to draw the attention of the Chinese people to the Northwest. At 5:00 PM, National Government Chairman Lin personally visited and did not leave until after an hour. Lin inquired in detail about the current situation in the Northwest and the matter of Xi'an as a secondary capital. Dai plans to rest for a day or two and then go to Hangzhou to participate in the Kalachakra Dharma Assembly. Reporters visited Dai and were received by Wu Xinheng, who accompanied him back to Nanjing, who described his impressions of this trip, saying that the impression of this trip to the Northwest was better because the bandit disasters of the past have gradually returned to their former state. The Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College has held its founding ceremony, and the school buildings are under construction, but due to the large scale of the project, it will not be possible to start school until next year. On the 24th, he met Song Ziwen in Luoyang and only talked at the station for five hours. Dai provided Song with his inspection experience for reference. Due to time constraints, Song will only stop in Xi'an, and plans to postpone his trips to Qinghai and Ningxia. The result of this inspection is that the primary development of the Northwest should first focus on water conservancy. In addition, transportation and highways are also necessary. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Chuanxian, together with Xu Chonghao, Wang Yingyu, and others, arrived in Nanjing by special train on the afternoon of the 26th. Staff from the Examination Committee, Selection Committee, and Evaluation Department of the Examination Yuan crossed the river to welcome them. After Dai got off the train and crossed the river, he entered the city and returned to his private residence to rest. Chairman Lin visited Dai at 4:00 PM to discuss his impressions of the trip to the West. According to Dai, those who visited him, due to the limited time, he was unable to stay longer in Gansu and Qinghai to broaden his horizons, which he greatly regretted. However, through this trip, he became acquainted with people from various places, which will make it easier to travel again in the future. As for his feelings, in general, it can be said that this was the first satisfying trip since leaving home at the age of fifteen. The various ethnic groups in the Northwest live together, and those who discuss this often consider the ethnic issue to be very difficult to resolve. This can be said to be a major misconception of those who do not read modern books and do not digest them. The various ethnic groups in the Northwest are no more than different surnames in the interior. Just as different surnames can coexist and progress together, why can't different ethnic groups integrate? What is especially felt is that this time Xian believes that he is just returning to his hometown to visit old friends, and not traveling far away. Everyone says that trees have roots and water has sources. The great waters of China are none other than the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, which both originate in Qinghai. This shows that the various ethnic groups in the Northwest and the Han people are originally one family. They have long lived in their hometown, while we have developed abroad. As for religion, language, and writing, they are only things that have evolved over thousands of years of history and have nothing to do with whether races are the same or different. As for the Mongol, Tibetan, Hui, and Han nationalities seen in Xining, all have a spirit of progress, which is truly gratifying. In particular, the art and architecture of Gansu and Qinghai are especially admirable, and the beauty and intelligence of the people of Lanzhou are no less than those of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In the future, as long as transportation and water conservancy are handled properly, they will naturally move forward step by step. The great unified civilization and new life of China are in the Northwest, which is why this trip has strengthened my belief. As for the Agricultural and Forestry College, the foundation has now been laid. As long as those in charge do the work practically, it is determined that it can be successful. As for its relationship with the local area, let alone the future, even now, the disaster victims in Wu and Mei counties have already benefited significantly. Anyone in Shaanxi must be able to say this, without the need for further discussion. Because I am a little tired from the long journey, I plan to rest for two days before going to Hangzhou to participate in the Dharma Assembly. (26th Central News Agency)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan, noting the increasing number of divorce cases, has issued the following example: If one spouse is subjected to abuse by the other that makes cohabitation unbearable, they may petition the court for divorce. The term "abuse that makes cohabitation unbearable" is not limited to physical harm; mental anguish that renders cohabitation intolerable also constitutes abuse. While a spouse subjected to such abuse may seek divorce, the abuse must reach the level of making cohabitation unbearable. Minor altercations or instances of assault that are followed by reconciliation and forgiveness do not constitute grounds for divorce, and cannot be used as the basis for a divorce petition.

<p>For more than a month, rumors about Germany's imminent recognition of the puppet organization have been rampant. European newspapers have published many conflicting reports on this matter. After the embassy in Germany made many inquiries and questioned the German government, it learned the content of the matter. Here is a special description:</p>
<p>The most noteworthy information obtained from Berlin includes the following two: (1) A Japanese Joint News Agency report stated that negotiations on German-Manchurian economic issues have begun in Tokyo. German Ambassador to Japan Dircksen, German Embassy staff member Kroll, who recently returned to Japan after inspecting Manchuria, and German Consul to Harbin Balser all participated. It was also said that Kroll's staff will return to Berlin on March 1 and report on the issue of Germany's recognition of Manchukuo at this time. (According to this news, it was seen in the Berlin Daily on February 17, 1934, which was based on news from Amsterdam. The news released by the Japanese Club in Germany on February 17 was also the same. It can be seen that this news was indeed released by the Japanese side.) (2) The Berlin Germania newspaper reprinted a report from the London Financial Times on February 21 of this year. The newspaper's correspondent in Tokyo stated that the plan of Germans to obtain an economic base in Manchuria has failed. Japanese and French industrial investment groups in Manchuria will sign an agreement, but Germany has not been able to participate. Eighteen months ago, General Von Seeckt had planned to supply Manchuria with military supplies, but was rejected by Manchukuo. On September 10 last year, Colonel Ott, the German military attaché to Japan, went to Manchuria with a personal letter from German Chancellor Hitler to discuss the issue of recognizing Manchukuo and requesting certain patents from Manchuria to Germany. Because this plan failed, German businessmen have left Manchuria one after another, and only the Stinnes Company is still there.</p>
<p>According to the above two pieces of news, not only the Chinese side is deeply uneasy, but even the Germans who usually sympathize with the Chinese side are also quite worried. The embassy in Germany has repeatedly questioned the German Foreign Ministry and inquired from other parties. As a result, it was learned that this news was all groundless.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the news about German-Manchurian relations published in the Berlin Daily mentioned above, the embassy in Germany ordered Counselor Tan Boyu to informally visit the responsible personnel of the German Foreign Ministry. According to the reply, it was all false. However, German Consul to Harbin Balser did stay in Tokyo, but there was no mission. Also, Balser went to Japan via Honolulu to meet his son on a German warship. As for the matter of Kroll's staff returning to Berlin to report, it was even more unfounded. (According to this news, it was seen in Information No. 337 released by the Japanese Club in Germany on February 17 of this year.)</p>
<p>(2) On February 26 of this year, the German News Agency, Deutsche Machrichtns Buro, released a message saying that rumors have been spreading recently that Germany will recognize Manchukuo. After checking the rumors, responsible parties stated that they were rumors created by people with ulterior motives and completely inconsistent with the facts. On the same day, the Berlin Broadcasting Station also spread the same news. Major German newspapers also published the same news. The Berlin Germania newspaper reprinted an article from the German Diplomatic Political News Agency on February 22, refuting the article about [Germany and Manchuria], which was even more blatant. The article stated that it was true that a staff member of the German Embassy in Japan had once gone to Manchuria to investigate business matters. As for General von Seeckt, although he had been to Manchuria, it was only in a private capacity. As for Colonel Ott, there was no such thing as going to Manchuria with a personal letter from the German Chancellor. German commercial firms in Manchuria are all operating normally and are not related to the Japanese and French investment groups.</p>
<p>Based on a comprehensive observation of the above news, the move of Germany to recognize the puppet organization will not be realized for a while. Moreover, a responsible German person once said that the Japanese have made sacrifices of blood and flesh for Manchuria and will never seek benefits for others. After careful analysis of this statement,</p>
<p>Even if Germany is unwilling to stay out of the Manchurian market due to economic relations, but weighing the pros and cons, Germany will definitely not be the first to recognize the puppet organization, it can be asserted.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Japan is Building Seven Major Railways in Northeast China (Harbin Correspondence): Obviously to Deal with the Soviet Union; Completely Handled by the South Manchuria Railway; All with Military Implications; Deployment in the Greater Khingan Mountains; Stationing Troops in the Wuling Mountains <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army stationed along the Chinese Eastern Railway has packed up their luggage and is preparing to return. They are called triumphant, and everyone has smiles on their faces. We have endless unspoken suffering, and even more powerful troops - the Nagoya Division - have been replaced. What is their intention? People here have generally understood that it is to deal with the Soviet Union. However, the Japanese army knows that it is not enough to rely solely on military force to fight. What's more, modern warfare requires a huge army and a powerful transportation system to support it. The three northeastern provinces do indeed have criss-crossing railways, which are almost sufficient, but they are not enough to confront the Soviet Union. Therefore, it has now been decided to immediately build seven railways. The routes are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Mudanjiang to Jiamusi Railway</p>
<p>(2) Lingyuan to Chengde Railway</p>
<p>(3) Yebaishou to Yifeng Railway</p>
<p>(4) Erzhan to Heihe Railway</p>
<p>(5) Changchun to Dalai Railway</p>
<p>(6) Dalai to Taonan Railway</p>
<p>(7) Huaiyuan to Solon Railway</p>
<p>These seven routes have been agreed upon by the Japanese and the Kwantung Army in the puppet government of Changchun. The South Manchuria Railway Company is responsible for the construction. (We must know that the South Manchuria Company is equivalent to the British East India Company, and it is not an ordinary enterprise or commercial organization.)</p>
<p>The estimated project cost is 140 million Japanese yen. Needless to say, the construction materials are entirely supplied by Japan or companies affiliated with the South Manchuria Railway.</p>
<p>On the surface, this seems to be an economic undertaking, but it is not. First, look at the Lingyuan to Chengde Railway. Not only will it control the entire province of Rehe, but it also has a conspiracy to peep into Chahar in the west and harass Hebei in the south based on the shape of the Wuling Mountains. As for the line from Yebaishou to Chifeng, outsiders mostly believe that its intention is to seize local gold mines and other products. In fact, this is still a secondary meaning. The most important thing is to advance into Inner Mongolia, while also having the intention of invading Outer Mongolia as an attachment.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the railway along the Mudanjiang River from Mudanjiang Station via Yilan to Jiamusi. In the past, Japan's operation of the Northeast focused all its efforts on South Manchuria. In North Manchuria, it has not been able to control the Chinese Eastern Railway. Now, the Jihui Railway is almost a success, and the line from Tumen to Mudanjiang is also about to be completed. However, the Japanese have no guarantee for the immigration of the Songhua River coast, and there is no preparation for military transportation in northeastern Jilin. Therefore, this railway must be built quickly. On the one hand, it can establish an economic foundation for invading North Manchuria, and on the other hand, it also increases the convenience of attacking the Soviet Union's Primorsky Krai.</p>
<p>Again, is Japan's military plan for the Soviet Union. Although it has not been completely determined, in the offensive defense of North Manchuria, the border fortress of Manzhouli is not something that can be borrowed in modern military affairs. Deploying defenses along the Heilongjiang River is both easy to suffer losses and will cause current difficulties. Therefore, after several inspections by the Kwantung Army, it was finally decided to take the Greater Khingan Mountains as the first line of defense against the Soviet Union in the west. Solid fortresses are currently being built. Changchun to Dachar, Dalai to Taonan, and Huaiyuan to Solon are mainly intended to facilitate the construction of defense fortifications in the Greater Khingan Mountains. In the event of an incident in the future, there will be another tool that can be used, and the Xilin Gol League can also be seized from the side to enter the eastern part of Chahar. This is a two-sided conspiracy of Japan.</p>
<p>Also, the road from Erzhan to Heihe directly shoots at Hailanpao on the opposite bank of the Heilongjiang River. If you want to use this road to break the connection between the Ussuri Railway and Siberia with heavy troops, it will be easier for him to attack Vladivostok. At the same time, if he can achieve his desired goals in order, Tokyo and Osaka can reduce the threat of air strikes. Therefore, he is very</p>
<p>Focus on the construction of this railway, to create its offensive strength in a short period of time, to let his iron hand touch the Soviet Union. As for the decision of victory or defeat, I am afraid that it is still in the hands of the person standing on the side, and it is not known. (April 17)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Jilin Puppet Authorities Forcibly Buy People's Land: City Residents Severely Oppressed and Forced to Obey; Villagers Refuse to Yield and Join the Righteous Army <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: Japanese troops abuse the people of Northeast China in every possible way. All their cunning schemes are carried out by the puppet authorities under Japanese orders, ostensibly to avoid their notorious reputation. However, their ferocious wolf-like faces are ultimately exposed. For example, this time they forcibly purchased land in Jilin. In the cities, residents had no choice but to obey and had no way to resist. However, the farmers in the countryside all had firearms and sought survival in death, rising up in resistance. Thereupon, the Japanese disregarded everything and used airplanes and artillery to massacre the villagers, leveling seventeen villages, a tragedy too horrible to bear. The following details are recorded:</p>
<p>The puppet Jilin Municipal Preparatory Office, under Japanese orders and in the name of consolidating port affairs, arbitrarily forcibly bought civilian land in the commercial port area, numbered it, and released it for construction, revising the regulations for renting and building in the commercial port. The method for purchasing civilian land was decided by the puppet port affairs committee, with the majority of the civilian-owned vacant land east of the commercial port's main road being considered suitable for acquisition, as it was located in important locations. West of the main road, only a small portion of land belonging to the Li family in Qingnianhui East Hutong, as well as the Fan and Guan families outside Beixin Kai Gate, the Xiao family outside Bahu Gate, and several parcels of vacant land such as the Huiyuan Distillery west of Chalu Kou, were to be included in the acquisition. All other areas were not to be acquired at this time. A list of the areas to be acquired this time was posted, and all landowners on the list were not allowed to prepare for construction or cultivation. All land deeds and title deeds for the listed lands were to be submitted to the office by April 30th to obtain receipts, so that personnel could be dispatched to measure the area together with the landowners and then set a date to issue prices according to regulations. As for the scattered small parcels of civilian land and houses outside the list but along suitable routes, which must be acquired for the sake of consolidating port affairs, it was planned to notify the landowners to acquire them according to regulations after they were determined.</p>
<p>The Japanese and puppet Jilin provincial authorities, having adopted the method of acquiring land from the citizens of Jilin, again applied it to the Yilan area in northeastern Jilin, the former defense zone where General Li Du led his troops in a desperate battle against the Japanese army. They declared the area as a reclamation zone, and all original landowners had to accept the acquisition according to the method of acquiring civilian land. The people of the area, nurtured by the spirit of resisting Japan, were extremely resistant. They also discovered that the authorities only issued receipts for the land deeds and title deeds they first collected, which was the same step as acquiring civilian firearms. Thereupon, public sentiment was in an uproar, and hundreds of villages spontaneously united, gathering over a thousand strong young men with guns. Resolving to fight to the death rather than surrender, they first killed or dispersed their wives and children, then launched a swift attack on the nearby Japanese troops, killing over two hundred and fifty Japanese. For a time, the Japanese and puppet authorities in the provincial capital were very frightened and dispatched over thirty airplanes, as well as artillery, to bomb the area. It is estimated that the seventeen villages that first initiated the uprising were completely reduced to rubble, a scene too tragic to witness. Afterwards, the Japanese realized that the method they had adopted was inappropriate, as it had aroused a popular uprising. They urgently kept it secret, prohibiting any publicity, and few outsiders knew about it. Currently, the thousand-plus people have formed a volunteer army. As it is difficult to resist the enemy, they have retreated to the mountains and are temporarily stationed there.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Jiangxi Headquarters: Strictly Prevent Abuse of the Blockade, Measures for Dealing with Illegal Goods <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Jiangxi Headquarters, in accordance with the methods for blockading bandit areas, stipulates that all transportation of military supplies must be submitted to the highest military authority to which they belong for approval and issuance of permits or certificates before they can be inspected and released. Those without permits will be detained by local military police teams. Transportation of daily necessities requires a certificate or permit that can provide responsible proof before it can be allowed to pass; otherwise, it is absolutely prohibited. The above methods did not clearly stipulate how to handle goods seized without permits or certificates, or goods that did not match the certificates. Such cases have always been handled by weighing the circumstances, carefully considering the facts of the crime within the scope of the law, and providing appropriate treatment. While striving for strict blockade, considerable consideration was given to the convenience of the people, originally hoping for minimal disturbance to the people and effective results. Recently, because the defined words [detention] [prohibition] were too vague, the handling in various places differed, resulting in numerous abuses. Some confiscated without authorization, some released on bail, some confiscated goods and then fined, and some confiscated goods and imprisoned the person. Various malpractices were endless. If not clearly stipulated, how can fairness be shown and the blockade emphasized? Therefore, two points of measures are specially stipulated for subordinates to comply with: (1) Military supplies and supplies aiding bandits seized in violation of the methods for blockading bandit areas shall be confiscated and dealt with according to law, and the perpetrators shall be punished in accordance with Special Law and Common Criminal Law according to the identity of the offender and the circumstances of the crime, in accordance with Instruction No. 1417 of this headquarters. (2) For daily necessities without permits or certificates or with non-compliant permits, or with goods that do not match the permits, if there is no suspicion of aiding the bandit area, 20% of the transported goods will be confiscated for public use. The distribution standard is half to the personnel who made the breakthrough and half to local public welfare undertakings. The remaining items will be ordered to be sold locally, without any release, to show punishment and emphasize the blockade, and the purchaser's certificate must be obtained and submitted for assessment to prevent abuse.

According to the person in charge of the River Affairs Bureau, the wooden stakes along the Yellow River have been installed, and it is scheduled to start work on the entire river simultaneously on May 1, to be completed in 40 days. The surface of the levee is stipulated to be widened by six丈 (approx. 19 meters) and increased by two meters. It is planned to give one 角 (approx. 1/10 of a dollar) for each cubic 市方 meter of soil, using soil from inside the levee as much as possible, and taking it from outside the levee when it is insufficient. If there are wheat seedlings, it is prepared to結洋 (compensate) one dollar. Regarding stone transportation vehicles, the Longhai Railway Bureau has agreed to allocate three trains per day. As for transferring to the River Theatre, a light railway will be built from Xiguan to Heigangkou in Zhongmu. The River Affairs Bureau originally had eight里 (approx. 4 kilometers) of light railway track, and Director Kong Xiangrong has agreed to lend twenty里, which is enough. It will be架修 (constructed) soon. The section from the station to Xiguan plans to hire 500 horse-drawn carts for transportation, giving two dollars per cart per day. In addition, the River Affairs Bureau directly hires 200 ships to transport stone materials to and from various counties daily. The most important projects,民夫, and tools for the Yellow and Qinhuai Rivers are as follows: The Yellow River should carry out earthworks of 57074.88方 in Guangwu, 61722.21方 in Zheng County, 89723.77方 in Zhongmu, 121159.45方 in Kaifeng, 43802.10方 in Chenliu, 41021.10方 in Lanfeng, 6218.51 in Meng County, 92945.83 in Wen County, 93052.40 in Wuzhi, 27396.33 in Yuanwu, 24292.36 in Yangwu, and 5540.96 in Fengqiu, totaling 769916.9020方.

Rules such as confiscating the deposit for those who register but do not收繭 (collect cocoons) have been announced and implemented. The department now believes that it has been a long time overdue. Considering the initial implementation, it has specially re-extended the deadline to May 10th. Yesterday, it specially ordered各县蚕桑改良区 (various county sericulture improvement areas). [The case查 (investigation) by the 省蚕业改進管理委員會 (Provincial Sericulture Improvement Management Committee), the 茧行统制办法 (cocoon firm control methods) has been passed, announced, and implemented at the provincial government committee meeting.

However, it is now April, and the original limit of the end of March has long expired. Considering that it is the first time it is being held, the deadline will be extended to May 10th so that it can be completed. All收茧行商 (cocoon collecting firms and merchants) should comply and follow the procedures before May 10th.

<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The situation of the Jiangnan seawall is precarious. The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department has surveyed and proposed a main project plan to select urgent parts to start construction according to the amount of funds available. The various situations have been略誌 (briefly recorded) in the previous report. It is now heard that the Jiangnan Dike Engineering Office of the department has prepared all the procedures for the previous project. The required wood piles and stone materials have been advertised for business to bid and contract. Businesses with the required material handling experience and capabilities can go to the department to領取标单 (collect bidding forms) and other documents from now until the 29th of this month, and bid according to regulations. The bidding will be opened in public at 10 am on the 30th of this month in the department's auditorium. In order to慎重 (ensure careful consideration) the project, the department has detailed招標章程 (tendering regulations), 办料细则 (material handling details), 施工细则 (construction details) and other types of rules. All 投標 (bidding)去取标凖 (selection standards), 工料 (work and materials) 騐收方法 (inspection methods), and 工程实施方法 (project implementation methods) are clearly defined. The important points are extracted as follows: (1) The value of the seawall's 工料 (work and materials) will be strictly investigated on-site in the market by personnel dispatched by the Construction Department. After the bidding is opened, the bidders who offer reasonable prices, have rich experience, and sufficient capital will be selected and announced as the winning bidder and the alternate winning bidder. (2) The招商承攬 (business contract) will be prepared in triplicate as usual, plus an additional copy to be posted in the Seawall Engineering Office. (3) When the wood is transported to the 工時 (construction site), the 騐收員 (inspector) will inspect, circle, and register the number逐一 (one by one) according to the specified quality, length, and circumference, and the contractor will arrange and積 (stack) them in the designated location. (4) When the stone is transported to the 工時 (construction site), the 監工員 (supervisor) will逐船騐收 (inspect each ship), and the contractor will transport and unload them at the designated time and mark a landmark for identification.

<p>Yao Songxian and Others Request the Removal of County Magistrate Jin: Citizens Yao Songxian et al., opposing the river dredging method, also jointly submitted a report to the provincial department yesterday, stating: (Omitted above) Currently, construction has begun in the area from Dongmenwai to Huayang Bridge. The workers rely on 　,堆泥 (piling up mud) anywhere, not following the designated location, not following the instructions of the section members, entering residential gardens and houses without authorization, and taking bamboo shoots and稻草 (straw) without authorization. Conflicts and fights are everywhere. The police force is too thin and unable to suppress them. Civilians are suffering unbearably. Local newspapers record it every day, but the authorities turn a blind eye. The Imperial 　 Announcement only solicits the province to allocate construction funds and shows the people of the city 　 benefits. The construction funds are collected from the fields. Who is not our people? The river dredging project is not construction? Using the local finances for local undertakings, the provincial department is selfless and fair, and there is no need for the county magistrate to beg the province to ask for them. Playing with its wording, it一方面 (on the one hand)表功 (show merits) to the citizens, and 一方 (on the other hand)适 (just)以 (to)见 (see)省厅 (the provincial department)'s 悭吝 (stinginess), selling 长官 (officials) to show benefits. Is his heart still questionable? The levying of rent is an illegal 暴敛 (exaction). During the "January 28th Incident" two years ago, former County Magistrate Shen and two or three local bullies took advantage of the fire and robbery, armed with weapons, levying and arresting civilians. At that time, due to military congestion, there was no way to tell. The civilians endured the pain and dug up, and it was heard that the total amount was about 50,000 yuan. After several years, there has been no report of paper and letters. This time, County Magistrate Jin, Technician Xu Moji, and a few unscrupulous gentry are replicating the same thing. Our people swear not to accept it. Therefore, we telegraph and request that Songjiang County Magistrate Jin Tigan and Technician Xu Moji be immediately dismissed and investigated. On the one hand, the county magistrate 　 submitted and approved the contracting contract to be revoked.责成 (Order) the Public Security Bureau to le勒 (order) hundreds of 客民 (foreigners) to be forced out of the county to protect public security. The city river project is still handled by local scholars and people, in accordance with the previous case, and negotiated and submitted for approval. The local area is fortunate.

<h3 id="e105">Suzhou: Rickshaw Pullers' General Strike, Disorder Occurs on Guanqian Street <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>All 3,500 rickshaw pullers in Suzhou, due to the recent decision of the Public Security Bureau's Bureau Affairs Conference to ban rickshaws, stipulating that empty cars are not allowed to be dragged arbitrarily on the streets, believing that they cannot solicit passengers and that it hinders their livelihoods, suddenly launched a general strike yesterday (26th) morning at 6:00 AM. They first released the air from all the car tires, and then, in groups of hundreds,阻 (obstructed) 自备 (self-owned)包车 (chartered cars) passing through the main areas 　二三分所 (the second and third branch stations of)巡官 (patrol officer) Wang Xunxiang led the police to persuade them without success, so they telephoned the Public Security Bureau. Bureau Chief Shen Gao　immediately dispatched a row of Flying Patrol Team, led by 巡官 (patrol officer) Xie Huaiqing to Guanqian, and arrested the leading rickshaw pullers. At that time, it was already past 9:00 AM, and Guanqian gathered six or seven hundred rickshaw pullers. Seeing the Flying Patrol Team arresting people, they 包围 (surrounded) and 殴打 (beat) the guards. 巡官 (patrol officer) Wang, et al. were also beaten. 巡官 (patrol officer) Liu was cuffed on the neck with a 麻绳 (hemp rope) and dragged along the road. Liu, being outnumbered, opened fire with a 朝天手枪 (pistol pointed upwards). The Flying Patrol Team also fired 盒子炮 (box cannons). For a time, the order was 혼란 (chaotic). Guanqian Street shops immediately closed their doors. It opened in half an hour. As a result, rickshaw pullers Qi Xiaoyou (25 years old) and Liang　Cai (25 years old) were shot. Qi was more seriously injured in the knee, and Liang was injured in the head. They were sent to Guangmin Hospital to extract the bullets. At that time, each branch station received the news, and the officials and police immediately dispatched all of them and strictly enforced martial law, but the street police in　门 (　門) Ma Road, Guanqian, and Jingde Road were beaten. The police have arrested 12 rickshaw pullers, including Zhu Huailong and Xue Yinshan, and taken them to the bureau. The crowd then dispersed. Also, when the rickshaw pullers were on strike and occurred disorder, lawyer Li Mian took a 自备 (self-owned)包车 (chartered car) to the court and was beaten by the strikers when he passed Guanqian Street. The侦缉队 (detective team) also detained He Jue, who was suspected of instigating the labor tide. The officials believed that the cause of the labor tide was the sudden onset and that there was or was not an organization in advance. The reason may not only be to ban拖空车 (dragging empty cars). Therefore, the investigation is currently being carried out with all efforts to determine the background and to find the main actors. After the disorder in Guanqian Street, the Public Security Bureau, the County Party Headquarters, the Rickshaw Rental Industry Association, and various rickshaw companies dispatched personnel to mediate and handle the situation. The county magistrate and the County Party Headquarters gathered the rickshaw pullers at the Party Headquarters at 5:00 PM. As a result, the rickshaw pullers had agreed to resume work today (27th). Last night, the military and police were heavily guarded. The Second Division of the Army stationed in Suzhou was stationed in the city and there was no accident.</p>

<p>The earthwork project of the Xiyu section of the Xihu Road has been started by personnel dispatched by the County Construction Bureau. It is reported that the villagers did not understand the situation and dared to gather crowds to make a fuss and beat the technicians. Later, the police brigade headquarters dispatched a team to the countryside to suppress it and arrested two villagers, Wu A-Wu and Wu Hua-Shi, who were responsible for the trouble, and sent them to the county for custody. Wu Hua-Shi was released after questioning and found to be innocent. The construction of the road is proceeding as usual. Yesterday, the county government received another order from the provincial government, which stated that the Southeast Transportation Fair will be held in June this year and will be led by Chairman Jiang himself. The Xihu Road is one of the routes to be passed. All roadbed projects on the road must be completed by the middle of May and the entire road must be opened to traffic. In addition to ordering the road engineering office to rush to build bridges and culverts, an order was also issued to the county to expedite the construction as soon as possible.

<p>In recent years, silk factories have been in a slump, many have closed, and wage demands from workers have been frequent. The Taisheng Silk Factory outside the East Gate was leased last year by Zhang Mingzhai from Shanghai and started operations, with Chen Jinsan, the owner of Chen Yixing Game Store at Tonghui Bridge, guaranteeing the rent and wages. Unexpectedly, it closed down not long after starting, owing the female workers ten days' wages. The female workers repeatedly demanded payment without success, so yesterday afternoon, more than fifty of them gathered and surged to Chen Yixing Game Store to find the guarantor, Chen Jinsan. However, the front of the game store was Hongtaixing Sauce and Fermented Grains Shop, owned by Gao Yangchen. Seeing the female workers rush in, Gao immediately closed the shop door and telegraphed the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau to send police to suppress the situation, bringing all the female workers and Gao Yangchen to the bureau. A strong officer interrogated them, and the female workers accused Gao Yangchen of letting Chen Jinsan escape, but Gao vehemently denied it. As a result, the officer ordered Gao to hand over Chen Jinsan within five days, and the matter came to a temporary end.</p>

<p>The Baitamiao Temple in Baitaxiang, the third district of Wuyi County, recently planned to hold a theatrical performance and a temple fair. The district head, Chen Yi, telegraphed the county government to send police to stop it. County Magistrate Cai dispatched Zhuang Zhenying, the first squad leader of the first squadron of police, and Gu Xiangnong, the second squad leader, leading thirty officers, to the village on the 23rd to prohibit the theatrical performance. Squad Leader Zhuang and others planned to return to Changzhou on the 24th, but were then ordered to prohibit the Baitaxiang temple fair on the 25th. That morning, Squad Leader Zhuang was at Zheng Lu Bridge, where District Head Chen Yi met with the police and patrol officers from the Public Security Sub-bureau. They were about to proceed to stop the fair when the Baitamiao temple fair also arrived at the town of Sanhekou. District Head Chen then questioned the village head, asking why, after guaranteeing to stop the fair, it was being held again. At that moment, the ignorant people at the fair attempted to make trouble for the district head. Squad Leader Zhuang stepped forward to dissuade them and prevent violence, but the broadsword team in the gathering carried firearms. Seeing Squad Leader Zhuang raise his hand, they suspected he was about to fire a gun, and the broadsword team fired first, piercing Squad Leader Zhuang's sleeve. At this point, the police also fired into the air, and the order was instantly disrupted. District Head Chen Yi was beaten by the villagers in the chaos and then taken away. The whereabouts of the clerk of the Public Security Sub-bureau are still unknown. The police tried their best to suppress the situation, and the villagers dispersed. Squad Leader Zhuang and others urgently tried to rescue District Head Chen, but after many inquiries, there was no clue. They then telegraphed the county government. County Magistrate Cai sent another team to the village to join the rescue effort. It was then learned that District Head Chen had been beaten severely, covered in blood, and his life was in danger. He was still tied up by the villagers inside the Baitamiao Temple. Whether the police have rescued him is still unknown.</p>

<p>After Yangzhong County Magistrate Feng Peisan was re-coffined the night before, his nephew, Feng Jiafan, received the bad news in Yangzhong and rushed there overnight. By the time he arrived, the coffin had already been sealed. Feng, believing that the cause of death, whether murder or suicide, was suspicious, advocated for an autopsy to dispel doubts and clarify the truth. He reported to the authorities and requested an examination. At 7:00 PM yesterday (the 25th), the court sent an examining magistrate to where Feng's coffin was placed. Workers pried open the coffin lid, removed the cement, and lifted Feng's body out, placing it on the coffin lid. Feng's face color was slightly changed, and blood still flowed from his nostrils. The examining clerk Shen then untied the clothes on the corpse and carefully inspected the entire body. Feng's family members observed the examination next to the body. It was determined that Feng's corpse only had a slight injury to the right hip bone, which had been pierced by something. The bloodstains on the back of the head and jaw were all accumulated blood flowing from the nose, not wounds. The abdomen was slightly elevated, containing water. Observing this shape, it was determined that he had drowned before death. After the examination, Feng signed and fingerprinted the corpse collection form and re-coffined the body.</p>

<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, Shanghai's cotton industry has always been known for its development, but recently, due to the dumping of foreign cotton, the domestic cotton market has plummeted. Furthermore, current inventories are piling up, and sales are stagnating. Although the Cotton Industry Association has discussed relief measures, due to the prevailing environment, no solution has been found. The Cotton Industry Association previously submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan, requesting prompt relief. The Ministry of Industry repeatedly sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate and consult with the local Cotton Industry Association on relief measures. It is learned that the Executive Yuan has ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to find ways to provide relief. Yesterday, the city government ordered the Social and Finance Bureaus to promptly devise relief measures. It is said that the authorities believe that Shanghai is an industrial center and that relief for the cotton industry is urgent. Currently, in addition to resisting the dumping of foreign cotton, cooperation among industry peers is necessary. It is said that the local cotton industry peers will be convened within days to solicit relief measures.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Thirty Million Yuan in Securities to Be Issued by the Government; Ministry of Finance Sends Personnel to Shanghai for Consultation <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, the Yigeng Indemnity Loan Syndicate, organized by sixteen banks including the Central Bank in Shanghai, included in its 44 million yuan loan contract with the Ministry of Finance that the syndicate would be allowed to issue 30 million yuan in securities to recover a portion of the loan. Recently, the Ministry of Finance observed that the money market in Shanghai was loose, and the banks did not need to urgently recover cash. It has sent personnel to Shanghai to consult with the banks on amending the contract to have the Ministry of Finance directly issue the securities. A Shenshi News Agency reporter investigated the details as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e115">Consultation by Ministry of Finance <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, during the Fujian Incident, needed a large amount of funds and had no choice but to use the Yigeng Indemnity refund funds to borrow 44 million yuan from sixteen banks, including the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, in Shanghai. Both parties entered into a contract on January 27 of this year, and Article 11 stipulated that the syndicate could [issue securities worth 30 million yuan at once]. At the time, the syndicate believed that the amount of the loan was very large, and the banks were deeply concerned about the impact on finance. To avoid illiquidity and financial stagnation, they made this request to reserve room for adjustment. Now, the Ministry of Finance believes that during this season of tea and silk sales, the money market in previous years was already very tight, but now, with the decline in international trade, the need for cash is not high, and the banks are still very loose. There is no need to issue this public debt. Therefore, it has specially dispatched Section Chief Xu of the Public Debt Department to Shanghai to consult with Zeng Rongpu, the secretary-general of the syndicate, and the relevant banks to change the issuance of public bonds to be done directly by the Ministry of Finance to save on procedures.</p>

<p>The sixteen banks, including the Central Bank, consulted with the personnel sent by the Ministry of Finance and believed that it was possible to reach an agreement. Yesterday, they convened a meeting of representatives from each bank at the Bank Club. Sixteen people attended, including Li Fusun, Xi Demao, Tang Shoumin, Song Ziliang, Hu Bijang, and Bei Songsun. After discussion, the decision was unanimously passed. However, the banks incurred considerable losses in preparing for the issuance, and no one was willing to take responsibility for compensating them. After consultation, the Ministry of Finance agreed to subsidize them to avoid losses to the banks.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Ministry of Finance Measures <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The procedure for the Ministry of Finance's 44 million yuan loan was originally that the Ministry of Finance would use the Yigeng Indemnity as collateral and issue 44 million yuan in public bonds to the syndicate as a reserve for the syndicate to issue 30 million yuan in securities. Now, the Ministry of Finance hopes to skip the step of the syndicate issuing securities. After the Ministry of Finance issues the securities in the future, it will sell them all to the syndicate. The banks can still use them as cash collateral or for trading, so there will be no risk of financial stagnation. In fact, it is no different from the syndicate issuing them itself. Once the procedures with the syndicate are agreed upon, the Ministry of Finance will soon begin preparations for the issuance.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance consulted the Shanghai Municipal Government, stating that although the land along the Huangpu River is of the nature of sandy fields and should be handled according to the regulations for sandy fields, the Whangpoo Conservancy Board has reported that all the land owned by the board is reserved for future conservancy or port affairs. Furthermore, most of it is held with licenses issued by the ministry, which is also a fact. Before the conservancy regulations are amended, the city government should consult with the board at any time regarding increasing taxes on Bund land, etc., to avoid disputes.</p>

<p>The products for China's participation in this year's Chicago Exposition were originally scheduled to be transported to the United States on the President Hoover on the 24th of this month. However, since they were not packed and transported to Shanghai in time, the board of directors decided that they would be shipped on the Grant on May 1.

<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Yu-Ping Railway, jointly constructed by the governments of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, is estimated to cost 60 million yuan. It has been decided to first raise half of the amount. The Shanghai banking community has agreed to lend 12 million yuan, and the contract has been signed. The loan guarantee has been approved by the Ministry of Railways and the governing provincial governments. A joint company has been organized to begin construction. Details are reported below:</p>
<h3 id="e128">Total Amount of Capital <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Yu-Ping Railway is located between Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. The importance of the entire road, in terms of military and transportation, is no less than that of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. The governments of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, in view of this, have planned to open it. Experts have conducted surveys and estimated that the total cost will be 60 million yuan to complete. It was decided to first raise half of the amount to start construction. The authorities of the two provinces each planned to raise 7.7 million yuan. The remaining insufficient funds were borrowed from Shanghai banks. Zeng Yangfu, Xiao Chunjin, and Chen Yaozu, representatives of the Ministry of Railways, were sent to Shanghai to repeatedly negotiate with Zhang Gongquan of the Bank of China, Tang Shoumin of the Bank of Communications, Qian Xinzhi of the Four Banks Savings Association, etc. As a result, it was agreed to lend 12 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Contract Signed <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The contract for the 12 million yuan of capital borrowed from the banking community was formally signed last week. The interest rate was set at 7.5% per annum. The repayment period will begin after the road is completed and will be repaid in installments. It is scheduled to be repaid in full within five years. In addition to the governments of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces using important local tax revenues as collateral, the Ministry of Railways will also use certain bonds as collateral. After the contract was formally signed by both parties, it has been reported to the governing provincial governments for record and approval.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Construction Begins <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The governments of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, having the funds in place, jointly organized the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Joint Company in Beijing. Starting from the 1st of this month, they have hired workers to carry out construction according to the designated route. The first section, from the Yushan Station at the end of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway to Nanchang, is scheduled to be completed by the end of March next year. The second section will be constructed from Nanchang to Pingxiang. The entire project is expected to be completed within two years.</p>
<p>Whoever bears the responsibility for East Asian peace, what is entrusted, and its significance, Mr. Iwai actually flatly admitted that Japan will make serious demands on China, saying, "There are currently no demands. If China cannot understand Japan's true intentions and continues to engage in international cooperation, which hinders the concept of East Asian peace, then Japan will make demands on China. The content of the demands is unknown at this time and will depend on the circumstances at the time." When Iwai spoke, he did not appear to be making an abrupt statement and said that he could take responsibility for his statement. This is sufficient evidence that Japanese diplomacy is being carried out with steps and preparations. He then explained, "The responsibility for maintaining East Asian peace is not entrusted by anyone. It is a belief shared by all Japanese, just like a person's religious faith." A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency asked whether, since the Japanese have this belief, is East Asia considered Japan's East Asia? Iwai repeatedly explained this point several times, all from the one-sided perspective of the Japanese side. Finally, he said that the meaning was too profound and stopped. In addition, Iwai also confirmed that Foreign Minister Hirota's so-called "Hands off" policy declaration was passed and approved by the Japanese government's cabinet and was not issued without authorization. Therefore, rumors that it would easily cause a political storm in Japan or was a tentative move to threaten other countries are not true. It is also a prepared move. As for Hirota's explanatory statement after issuing the declaration, Iwai said, "It is not a softening of attitude, nor is it a change of attitude. It is an explanation to the outside world to clarify misunderstandings about the declaration." He considered the two informal statements issued by China, one after the other, to be quite ordinary, saying that the Japanese side did not attach importance to them. However, the second statement was clearer than the first and slightly more serious in content.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Ministry of Communications Orders: Inspection of Foreign Vessels <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the inspection methods were discussed and an order was issued to all offices for compliance. The Shanghai Maritime Administration, in the past, found it difficult to inspect foreign vessels. Furthermore, foreign vessels entering port often refused inspection due to nationality issues. The National Shipping Company had previously petitioned the Ministry of Communications, stating that it was unfair that foreign vessels were never inspected. The Ministry of Communications consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the matter. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the ministers of various countries, stating that foreign vessels entering port should be inspected uniformly in the future. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now replied to the Ministry of Communications. Yesterday, it ordered the Shanghai Maritime Administration to diligently handle the inspection of foreign vessels entering port from all countries. Starting immediately, it will carry out inspections and will no longer make concessions. It is reported that after receiving the order, the administration discussed the inspection methods yesterday and issued an order to all offices for compliance.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Ministry of Communications: Opening of Shanghai-Shaoxing-Ningbo Long-Distance Telephone Service; Funds of More Than 100,000 Yuan Have Been Raised; Construction Will Begin Within Days and Be Completed in April <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, the Ministry of Communications, recognizing the busy commercial traffic between Shanghai and Ningbo, decided to open a direct long-distance telephone service between Shanghai and Ningbo to facilitate communication. The Shanghai Municipal Telephone Bureau is responsible for handling this. Funds of more than 100,000 yuan have recently been fully raised, and the work of installing telephone lines is actively underway. It will be formally realized after April. A reporter from the Shenshi News Agency learned the details as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e136">Opening of Shanghai-Ningbo Long-Distance Telephone Service <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The cities of Shanghai and Ningbo are geographically close, and commercial exchanges are very frequent. In particular, there are more people from Ningbo and Shaoxing residing in Shanghai than from any other region. In order to facilitate communication and foster a closer business relationship between the two regions, the Ministry of Communications has decided to establish a long-distance telephone line connecting Shanghai, Shaoxing, and Ningbo. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau has been specially instructed to handle this project. Following several consultations between the Bureau Chief Mr. Xu Xueyu and the telephone bureaus of Shaoxing and Ningbo, preparations have been actively underway and are now largely completed. The route runs from Shanghai via Hangzhou, then directly to Shaoxing and finally to Ningbo. The Shanghai-Hangzhou section is already in operation. It has recently been decided to construct the Hangzhou-Shaoxing and Shaoxing-Ningbo sections to complete the entire line.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Funding Secured, Completion Expected in April <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The total cost of constructing the Shanghai-Ningbo long-distance telephone line is estimated to be over ten thousand yuan. Thanks to the support of local gentry and merchants in both Shanghai and Ningbo, the entire amount has now been secured. The survey and construction of the line will commence within days, and the entire project is expected to be completed by April. The detailed regulations for the management and tariffs after the line becomes operational will be drafted by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and submitted to the Ministry for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e138">### Chinese National to Compile English-Language China Yearbook, Publication Expected at Year-End <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Shi Liangcai, Chen Liting, and others have recently initiated the organization of an English-language China Yearbook Society. The society's address is located at 321 Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, Shanghai. Work has already commenced, with the entire book expected to comprise approximately 1.4 million characters. It will adopt the latest compilation methods used in yearbooks from various countries, and the content will strive for brevity and completeness. Experts will be commissioned to write each chapter. The Commercial Press has been tentatively entrusted with publication, with publication scheduled for the end of this year. The Society's editorial rationale has been located and is appended below:</p>
<p>In modern times, yearbooks in various countries can be broadly divided into two categories: those of a specialized nature and those of a general nature. The latter can be further categorized by those focusing on a single country and those focusing on the world. The publication of the Shen Bao Yearbook last year was a huge success, and the first edition is about to be released. Other works of a specialized nature, such as the Economic Yearbook of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Education Yearbook of the Ministry of Education, are also about to be published.</p>
<p>The above works are all in Chinese, which is convenient for Chinese people to reference. However, foreigners wishing to study Chinese issues are unable to consult them due to the significant language barrier. Consider our neighbor Japan, which spends vast sums of money each year to compile and publish an English yearbook to promote its national conditions to the world, regarding it as a powerful tool for international propaganda. The significance of publishing an English yearbook is readily apparent. It is inconceivable that the Chinese have consistently abandoned this important work, allowing an Englishman, Mr. Woodhead, to handle it for more than a decade. This is not only a deficiency in China's cultural publishing industry but also a national disgrace.</p>
<p>Last year, dozens of writers in Shanghai jointly issued a declaration hoping that all national institutions would not provide Mr. Woodhead with materials. However, this is a passive measure. Active work should focus on Chinese people compiling their own English yearbook as a replacement. We, the undersigned, based on this principle, have initiated the organization of an English-language China Yearbook Society, and we hope that the Chinese people will lend their support to this undertaking. We would be very grateful.</p>

<p>Yang Hu, a standing committee member of the preparatory committee for the Chinese Seamen's Union, has requested the Central Government to resign due to his busy schedule with the Security Office, making it impossible for him to attend to both. Various seamen's organizations in the city have jointly submitted another petition urging him to stay. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Telegraph to the Central Government <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Various seamen's organizations jointly petitioned the Central Government yesterday, stating in the original text: "To the esteemed Central Guidance Committee on People's Movement: We were shocked and distraught to read in the newspaper that Committee Member Yang Xiaotian had requested to resign from his concurrent position on the Preparatory Committee for the Seamen's Union due to his busy schedule with the Security Office. We believe that Committee Member Yang is an advanced member of the Party and the nation. Since he has been in charge of maritime affairs, his leadership has been effective, and everything has been brought into order. He is no less than a benevolent father to the seamen. Please promptly grant a consolation to retain him. The future of maritime transport will be fortunate indeed." Signed by the entire 15,000 seamen of Shanghai Yan Ying General Company, Yan Ying South Company, Nan Jun An Sailors' Guild, North Jun An Sailors' Guild, Tianjin Sailors' Guild, Hubei Sailors' Guild, Lianyi Association, and Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. Wheel Management Department, Tongyi Society, etc.</p>
<p>"To the esteemed Central Executive Committee Guidance Committee on People's Movement: We were inexplicably alarmed to hear the news of Committee Member Yang Xiaotian's resignation from the Seamen's Union. We believe that the preparatory work of the Seamen's Union is nearing completion. We are relying on Committee Member Yang to bring it to a conclusion so that the whole project could be accomplished. If Committee Member Yang unfortunately leaves, then the glimmer of hope that the seamen have just gained will be extinguished. We implore your esteemed Committee to quickly grant a consolation to retain him, without allowing him to retire, in order to comply with the public's wishes and reassure the people. This is of utmost urgency." Signed by the Jun An Association of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, leading all employees of the sailors, stokers, and wheel management departments.</p>
<p>Distributed Telegrams to Various Locations The Shanghai branch of the Seamen's Union telegraphed various seamen's organizations across the country yesterday, stating: (Title abbreviated) "Committee Member Yang Xiaotian has abruptly resigned from his concurrent position on the Preparatory Committee for the Seamen's Union due to his busy schedule with the Security Office. The news has filled us with dismay. The meeting has resolved to sincerely urge him to stay. The following telegram has been sent to the Central Guidance Committee on People's Movement, which reads: 'We believe that Committee Member Yang Xiaotian is an advanced member of the Party and the nation, the central figure for the seamen. He is building a million-strong labor protection and establishing a millennia-long foundation for maritime transport. Yet, he has abruptly resigned from his concurrent position on the Preparatory Committee for the Seamen's Union due to his busy schedule with the Security Office, causing the masses of laborers to lose their protector. The news has filled us with profound dismay. Therefore, we earnestly request that you quickly grant a consolation to retain him, and we earnestly request that Committee Member Yang consider the hardships of the people and dismiss his intention to resign. The seamen will be fortunate indeed.' Chinese Seamen's Union Shanghai Branch Preparatory Committee, stamp."</p>
<p>"To all branches and organizations: Since our Seamen's Union has been led and prepared by Committee Member Yang Xiaotian, the atmosphere has been renewed, and the morale has been boosted. Now, the union's affairs are developing daily, the scale is fully prepared, the accumulated malpractices have been cleared away, and the formal establishment of the union is imminent. The benefits that our seamen have today are all thanks to Committee Member Yang. Recently, unfortunately, Committee Member Yang suddenly expressed his intention to resign. This news has caused widespread panic. People believe that Committee Member Yang's departure will not only destroy the nearly completed work in one fell swoop, but also the entire happiness that the seamen have hoped for for many years will become a pipe dream and will never be realized. In our dismay, we have no choice but to earnestly urge Committee Member Yang to consider the difficulties of the higher-ups and continue to be responsible for bringing the project to a successful conclusion. In addition to the telegram already sent, this matter concerns the future of the entire maritime industry, which is extremely important. We hope that your esteemed association will unanimously work to retain him, so that Committee Member Yang's intention to resign will be dismissed."</p>

<h3 id="e144">Residents of Laoshusha Oppose the Customs' Construction of an Ammunition Depot Four Representatives Petitioned in Beijing, Discussion Held by the Pudong Native Place Association <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Administration is currently planning to build a large-scale ammunition depot in Laoshusha, Songnan (i.e., Gaoqiaosha). Upon learning of this, the residents of the sandbar became alarmed and immediately convened a meeting of all residents of the sandbar, establishing a People's Self-Defense Corps. After discussion, the residents agreed that the Jianghai Customs' move was deliberately creating difficulties for them, damaging the prosperity of the sandbar, and severely harming the overall plan to revitalize the industry of Laoshusha. They immediately elected Hu Xiong, Chen Fengming, Zhu Yuan, Wang Qisong, Zhang Jintang, and others as representatives to petition in Beijing. Yesterday, a representative from the capital who had returned to Songjiang after filing a lawsuit mentioned this matter, stating (the following is all from the representative's perspective): The Jianghai Customs rented a piece of land that had already been filled in on Laoshusha from the Junpu Bureau, covering an area of approximately one hundred acres. This land is very close to the Asia and other oil depots, and even closer to Guanghua, less than half a li away. It is said that the Jianghai Customs initially submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Government for approval, but the Municipal Government refused to approve it because the sandbar had previously been designated by the Municipal Government as an oil depot area with the approval of the Ministries of Industry and Agriculture and Mining. Now, it is attempting to build an ammunition depot on the sandbar, which would be difficult to approve. However, the Jianghai Customs, due to the Municipal Government's disapproval, directly submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance and the Executive Yuan. The Yuan ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to comply. After receiving the Yuan's order, the Municipal Government, considering the danger posed by the storage of ammunition in the ammunition depot, required the Customs to take responsibility for safety. As a result, the Customs slowly implemented the British government's regulations for the construction of ammunition depots, designating a dangerous zone with a radius of 2,500 feet around the ammunition depot. The Municipal Government issued a joint announcement by the Municipal Land Bureau and the Public Works Bureau, prohibiting people from residing and constructing any buildings within the zone, and declaring that the Customs would not be responsible for any damage within the 2,500 feet. After reading the announcement, the sandbar residents, concerned about the lives and property of all residents of the sandbar, elected Chen Fengming, Zhu Yuan, Hu Xiong, and Wang Qisong as representatives to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance in Beijing. They were received by Secretary-General Zhao, representing Executive Yuan President Wang, and Vice Minister Qin, representing Ministry of Finance Minister He. In addition to submitting a formal petition, they presented the residents' opinions, arguing that the Jianghai Customs had chosen an inappropriate location because the various oil depots in the area stored huge amounts of gasoline, which was already extremely dangerous. If an ammunition depot was built less than half a li away, the consequences of an explosion would be devastating. Moreover, the oil depot area was prosperous with many merchants and residents, unlike in the past. They earnestly requested the President of the Yuan to revoke the previous order to build an ammunition depot in order to maintain the livelihood of the people. Secretary Zhao and others expressed their care and provided much comfort, promising to instruct the Shanghai Municipal Government to handle the matter properly. The four representatives felt satisfied and returned."</p>
<p>It was also learned that the Pudong Native Place Association held a meeting of directors and supervisors last night, and this case was also discussed. The general consensus was that Laoshusha is located at the northeast corner of Pudong, south of the confluence of the Jiang, Hai, and Pu rivers, at the throat of the transportation gateway. Storing such dangerous goods there would not be safe in peacetime, let alone in the event of an accident. A detailed investigation and study must be carried out, and then suggestions should be made to the authorities for thorough consideration to ensure complete safety.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Guangzhou Continues to Detain Artificial Silk Interwoven Fabrics The National Goods Maintenance Association Telegraphs Requesting Return <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association yesterday telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Guangdong Provincial Government, and the Department of Finance, stating: "We have recently received a letter from the Shanghai Guangbang Silk Fabric United Association stating that Yuyuanxiang, a member of our Association, purchased one hundred bolts of line crepe from the Shanghai Yingfeng Factory Silk Store on behalf of Guangzhou Yutaixiang, and mailed them to Guangzhou on March 5th. The Guangzhou Foreign Goods Piece Goods Special Tax Bureau Zhongxing Company detained them, claiming that they were foreign goods and required payment of a special tax before they could be released. This matter is currently under negotiation. Yesterday, we received a telegram from our counterparts in Guangzhou stating that on the 12th of this month, the company again detained over three thousand bolts of similar goods from various firms. As a result, the firms were forced to temporarily suspend the handling of goods to Shanghai via telegram. It has been found that Zhongxing Company has been in business for many years and has only ever auctioned foreign goods piece goods, never involving domestic goods. Now, they claim that artificial silk interwoven fabrics should be treated as foreign goods. We believe that our country's production is backward, and there is no substitute for artificial silk for the time being. Sometimes, we are forced to use imported raw materials, but if they are processed and manufactured by domestic factories, they are domestic goods. For example, if foreign yarn is used to weave domestic cloth, it conforms to the four classes of domestic goods stipulated in the National Goods Standards promulgated by the Ministry of Industry. How can it be classified as foreign goods? If this continues, the artificial silk interwoven fabric industry will inevitably be destroyed, and the future of domestic goods will be unimaginable. Your Association's business is closely related to ours, and we share the same pain. We hope that you will lend your full support and send telegrams to the relevant authorities in Beijing and Guangdong, as well as to Zhongxing Company, to argue on the basis of reason in order to strengthen our position and achieve the goal of canceling the arbitrary collection of taxes, so as to maintain domestic goods. We would be very grateful." Based on this, we believe that our country's silk fabrics used to sell well at home and abroad, reaching everywhere. However, since the exchange of goods between China and foreign countries, a large number of foreign artificial silk fabrics have been imported and sold in large quantities, and our country's silk fabrics, because of their color and luster, are not as good, and have been abandoned by women, resulting in failure. Silk weaving merchants have carefully studied and followed the methods of Eastern and Western silk, and also used artificial silk to interweave with real silk to form silk, and sold it on the market, so that they can sell well and maintain the status quo. However, since the various countries of the East and West have increased the import tax on our country's silk fabrics, the overseas market for our woven products has lost five or six out of ten. With the loss of Liaoning and Jilin, the only remaining market for silk fabrics has also been seized by strong neighbors. As a result, silk weaving merchants are getting worse year by year and are about to perish. This is the first reason why we urgently hope to find a way to help them get rid of the shackles. The artificial silk used in our country is all imported from the West, and is subject to a heavy tax of about 100% when imported. Weavers have to purchase it and make a living. But East Asian silk fabrics, because of the lack of import tax on artificial silk, are cheap. The South Sea Islands, which used to sell Chinese silk, are now selling East Asian silk. For example, Chinese silk costs one yuan per foot, while East Asian silk costs only five cents per foot. As a result, the South Sea market for Chinese silk has been lost. Fortunately, our National Government is promoting domestic goods, and requires imported silk fabrics to be subject to import tax, so as to maintain the domestic business of domestic goods, which is deeply appreciated by all industrial and commercial circles. If the Zhongxing Company claims that domestic goods are imported and uses its power to detain them, it is illegally destroying domestic goods. Won't the Guangdong market for Chinese silk be lost again? With fewer and fewer silk sales markets, the silk industry is declining day by day. If all the tax bureaus in the country follow suit, our domestic goods industry will inevitably be completely destroyed. Thinking of this, we feel extremely indignant. We should order them to stop and return the detained goods. This is the second reason to get rid of the shackles. The artificial silk in Japan, before it was self-made, was regarded as raw material and not subject to customs duties. After successful manufacturing and large-scale export, it was also not taxed. As a result, Japanese interwoven fabrics were cheaper than the same goods in our country, and could be imported as much as possible and compete in our market. If our country also destroys the slightly defensive fence, it will drive the people of the whole country to use Japanese interwoven fabrics. Isn't this the original intention of the National Government to set up a bureau to collect foreign goods tax? This is the third reason why we should strictly order and warn them not to illegally detain domestic goods. To sum up the three points, the Association believes that what is involved is not only the silk and cloth industries that are affected. Therefore, we dare to perform our duty of maintaining domestic goods and report the situation in detail. We implore your esteemed Yuan to order the Ministry and Department to investigate and verify, and to order the Zhongxing Company to quickly return the detained goods in full and not to have this kind of illegal behavior in the future, so as to maintain the domestic silk and cloth business. We cannot wait for your orders." Respectfully, Wang Jiean, Wang Xingyi, and Wang Hanqiang, Standing Committee Members of the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Three Dancers at the Lafayette Dance Hall Brawl; Manager's Case Continues Yesterday; Plaintiff Repeatedly Mistakes Manager's Name; Debate Concluded, Verdict Set for the Second of Next Month <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Dancer Yang Xianmei of the Lafayette Dance Hall, at 3:00 AM on the 9th of this month, inside the hall, was splashed with hot shrimp soup by fellow dancer Pan Meiying, soiling her newly made dance dress, leading to an argument. Another dancer, Chen Aying, assisted Pan in assaulting Yang. Complaining to the manager was not only futile, but she was also reprimanded, insulted, kicked, and injured, and lost her diamond ring and watch. She first went to the Second Special Court for a medical examination, then hired lawyer Huang Xiubo to file a lawsuit against the Lafayette Dance Hall manager and the two dancers, Pan and Chen, accusing them of joint assault in the Second Special District Court, requesting legal investigation.</p>
<p>In addition, she filed a civil suit to recover the lost jewelry and damages of three hundred yuan. Upon receiving the lawsuit, the court held a hearing on the 19th of this month. Because the plaintiff mistakenly listed the name of the first defendant, Lafayette Dance Hall manager Chen Yingjun, as accountant Chen Zhongying, she withdrew the case against Chen Zhongying in court and supplemented the indictment, adding Chen Yingjun and requesting his summons. The court approved this and ordered Pan and Chen to post bail and await rescheduling. These details were previously reported. Yesterday morning, the hearing resumed. Chen Yingjun and the two dancers, Pan and Chen, arrived with their respective defense lawyers. Judge Sun Pengxian presided over the hearing in the Criminal Division Two. First, the defense lawyer of the first defendant, Chen Yingjun, stood up and stated to the court that the name of the first defendant was mistaken in the previous indictment and in this supplementary indictment; the Lafayette Dance Hall manager is actually Chen Yingjun, not Chen Yingjun, and asked the court to note this.</p>
<p>The judge questioned the plaintiff as to who the first defendant actually was. The judge asked the plaintiff, Yang Xianmei, if the person she was accusing was the first defendant present in court. Yang replied that it was him, that he first grabbed her hands and allowed Pan and Chen to slap her face and</p>
<p>arms, and then Chen Yingjun kicked her to the ground. The plaintiff then asked the court to excuse her mistake and requested to correct the name. The judge then questioned Chen Yingjun, who stated that he was 48 years old, from Ningbo, and was the manager of the Lafayette Dance Hall. He said he had not hit the plaintiff. On the morning of April 9, the plaintiff was hitting someone in the writing room. He told her not to hit, but she did not listen. He then said that he would suspend her business tomorrow. Moreover, there were many police officers in the dance hall. If there was a problem, he could call the police, so why would he personally hit her? Later, the plaintiff went to the police station to file a complaint. When he went, he paid her ten yuan to buy clothing material. If it was not enough, he would say more tomorrow. He asked the court to ask the plaintiff if he had given her ten dollars. At this point, Chen Yingjun's defense lawyer stated that there were police officers present at the time and asked that they be summoned to court. The judge then summoned Sun Yuwan, the police officer in charge of the dance hall's entrance. He was first sworn in. He stated that he was managing the cars at the dance hall's main entrance. At that time, he heard a noise inside the hall and entered the writing room, where he saw the plaintiff standing near the writing desk, arguing with the two dancers, Pan and Chen. The manager was sitting in a chair and stood up, telling them not to argue. The plaintiff then went outside. He did not see the plaintiff fall to the ground. Because there were many vehicles in front of the door, he went outside to take care of the vehicles. Later, he saw the plaintiff leave in a Xiang Sheng taxi. The judge then questioned the plaintiff and the defendants, the two dancers Pan and Chen, about the circumstances of the assault. Their statements were the same as recorded in the previous report and will not be repeated here. The judge also asked the plaintiff if there were receipts or evidence for the lost diamond ring and watch. Yang replied that she had purchased them long ago and the receipts had been lost after several moves, but she usually wore them on her hand, and everyone in the hall had seen them. At this point, the court found the facts to be clear and ordered the debate to begin. After mutual debate between the two sides' lawyers, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the verdict for May 2, after which the court adjourned.</p>

<p>China spends nearly 10,000,000 yuan annually importing kerosene as a necessary fuel. However, all that is needed in the market is foreign goods. The sales of Mobil and Asiatic in China each year are more than tens of millions. Since the restoration of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations, the dumping of Russian oil by the Guanghua Company has become a three-way split. Therefore, the import volume of kerosene has increased dramatically compared to before. The statistical quantity of kerosene in the past five years is as follows: 55,177,498 customs taels in 1929; 54,864,540 customs taels in 1930; 64,549,371 customs taels in 1931; 94,244,822 national currency in 1932; and 87,450,738 national currency in 1933.</p>

The official also said that during the drawing, there will be XMHA (600 kilocycles) and XOHA (580 kilocycles) radio broadcasts, using Chinese and English to report the numbers as they are drawn.

<p>Since the restoration of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations, the Soviet Union has actively shipped its surplus goods to China for dumping. The most notable are gasoline, cement, timber, patterned cloth, and machinery. The dumping of gasoline in China has been dominated by Mobil, Texaco, and Asiatic. Since the dumping of Soviet Russian Guanghua Oil, the prices have been relatively low, and Mobil and the other</p>
<p>three companies have suffered considerable losses. The gasoline market in China has been taken over by Russian oil. As for cement, domestic production is very small, and the market used to use Japanese goods, but now it uses more Russian goods, and domestic cement production has also been severely hit. Soviet</p>
<p>timber has been shipped to China for dumping in recent years, competing fiercely with American goods, and it also has a tendency to monopolize the market. As for patterned cloth, because of its low price, it is quite popular among the Chinese people, with monthly imports reaching about 600,000 yuan. The import of machinery is also showing an upward trend, and it will soon invade the market for dumping.</p>

<p>Jin Jiulin, the detective inspector of the Special Agency of the French Concession Police, recently discovered that someone was secretly manufacturing red pills at No. 18, Dunren Lane, Wangzhi Road, a three-story building, late at night, and selling them in the city. The transactions were quite large. On the morning of the day before yesterday, he led detectives Qian Yumin, Zhang Ziying, and officers Liu Dianlong and Cui Zhenguo to secretly search the premises. There was no one in the house. Only in the manufacturing den on the third floor were ten cans of red pills seized, totaling 50,000 pills, one can of raw material white powder, another 92 pounds, one bag of red powder, weighing four pounds, one set of pill-making boards, six lead wire cloth trays, one sieve, one large and one small enameled basin, small basins containing unfinished red wet powder raw materials, five scales, one oven, one plywood board, and six stamps. After the search, it was found that the workers were hiding in No. 13 of the same lane during the day. They immediately rushed there and arrested three women, Lei Liushi (29 years old), Dai Jinzhang (30 years old), and Zhu A'da (44 years old), all from Pudong. Together with the evidence, they were taken to the police station. According to their confessions, the bosses were Sun Peisheng and Zhang Rongqing. Sun worked at the Zhongou Pharmacy at No. 282, Wuma Road in the Public Concession, and Zhang's whereabouts were unknown. The police chief immediately ordered the detention and ordered detective Qian Yumin to go to the Zhongou Pharmacy at 9:00 PM that night, together with detectives from the Public Concession Police, to arrest Sun Peisheng. Zhang, however, had heard the news and escaped, making it impossible to arrest him. Yesterday morning, the French Concession Police escorted the defendants to Criminal Division One of the Second Special District Local Court. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the case and requested a two-week extension to temporarily detain the defendants, pending the police's detailed investigation of the case for prosecution. The evidence was also presented to the court. Subsequently, the police detective reported the discovery of the manufacturing den and the arrest of the defendants. Judge Xiong Huiping reviewed the report and interrogated the defendants. All the defendants denied the charges. The court ordered a rescheduled hearing on May 10 after further investigation. The defendants were returned to custody, and the seized items were stored in the warehouse.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Pirated A Laughterful Marriage Discovered on the Market; Everything is the Same as the Real One, but the Printing is Inferior; The Book Also Contains Signatures by Li Haoran and Wang Xishen - Police Prosecute on Two Charges <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Henshui's novel A Laughterful Marriage has been popular since its publication and has been reprinted many times. The copyright was acquired by the Sanyou Bookstore on Fuzhou Road, and a registration certificate No. 660 was issued by the Ministry of Interior. Li Zengyao, the manager of Sanyou Bookstore, learned that the Chunming Bookstore at No. 440 Fuzhou Road was selling pirated copies of A Laughterful Marriage and the book Zibian published by the company. On the 4th of this month, he ordered his partners Yan Changyan and Zhang Hongdao to purchase three copies of A Laughterful Marriage and five copies of Zibian from Chunming, costing 3.9 yuan. Chunming did not store the books in the store but ordered its partners to retrieve them from the Wenguang Bookstore at No. 3, Lane 62, Shandong Road. After Yan and Zhang purchased the counterfeit books, they took them back and handed them over to Li. On the morning of the 14th, Li reported to the Laozha Police Station, requesting an investigation. Chinese detective Zhang Yuanqing and detective Xu Zexin purchased five copies of A Laughterful Marriage and other books from Chunming for 12 yuan (all with secret marks), while Zibian was not purchased at the time. The detectives took the books back and, after examining them, saw that the pirated A Laughterful Marriage looked the same as the real one, but the printing was blurry and inferior. They immediately went to arrest Chen Zhaochun, the manager of Chunming, a native of Haimen, and took him back to the police station. They also went to the Wenguang Bookstore to search, but found nothing. Chen Zhaohuan, the manager of Wenguang, confessed that the pirated Zibian was printed by the Qizhi Printing House at No. 19, Lane 53, Ximen Road, French Concession. The detectives went to the printing house and seized the printing plates and took them back to the police station. Chen Zhaochun confessed that he had purchased 128 copies of A Laughterful Marriage from Ping Jinya of the Zhongyang Bookstore at No. 6, Lane 328, Fuzhou Road for 64 yuan on February 12 of this year, after being mentioned by his shop assistant Zhang Boyin. The detectives went to the Zhongyang Bookstore to investigate, but Ping Jinya absolutely denied it. At that time, the police released Chen after filing a report and requesting the First Special Court to issue a subpoena. Yesterday morning, Chen was summoned to Criminal Division Two of the First Special Court. Judge Deng Baosun opened the court and heard the above situation from police lawyer Qian Xunjiu. He stated that he was now prosecuting according to Article 269 of the Criminal Law, and because the book had signatures and inscriptions by Li Haoran and Wang Xishen, all stamped with seals, he believed that there was also a situation of counterfeiting private seals, and prosecuted according to Articles 234 and 44 of the Criminal Law. He also stated that the case of the pirated Zibian has been prosecuted separately. Subsequently, Chinese detective Zhang Yuanqing and detective Xu Zexin submitted a report on the investigation. When Chen Zhaochun was questioned, he stated that he had purchased the novel A Laughterful Marriage at the door on February 12, reversing his previous statement at the police station that he had purchased it from the Zhongyang Bookstore. The judge asked him why his testimony in court was inconsistent with his testimony at the police station. He replied that he was wary at the police station. When asked if he had been tortured, he replied no. The judge said that since there was no torture, the police's statement was difficult to overturn. Judge Deng then said that since the police had already prosecuted the Zibian case separately, it was necessary to review whether there was any connection and whether it should be tried together, and ordered that the case be rescheduled for the 28th for further hearing. The defendant Chen Zhaochun was ordered to pay a shop guarantee of 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Abduction No Different from Kidnapping; The "Small Collapsed Cake" Good Deed Has Many Twists; Eight Characters Written on a Cigarette Pack <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Liu Yunxian, a doctor at No. 53, Dajing Road in the city, married a woman surnamed Xu from Huzhou. Xu has a younger sister, Yunzhen, who is 18 years old, petite and exquisite, with a good appearance, and still unmarried. Because her family was poor, her mother asked her eldest daughter to bring her to Shanghai to find work, and she temporarily resided at Liu Yunxian's home. Unexpectedly, she was recently seen by a "Baixiang Ren" (a person who loafs around doing nothing) in the French Concession nicknamed "Small Collapsed Cake," who wanted to marry Xu Yunzhen. He had personally gone to Liu Xu's home in the city to propose marriage and asked about Yunzhen's age, recording it on a cigarette pack, and volunteered to pay 60 yuan for the tea ceremony and two gold rings as betrothal gifts. At that time, Ms. Xu replied that this marriage matter must be approved by Yunzhen's mother, who was currently in the countryside, and that she would wait to write a letter to seek her consent before making a decision. Unexpectedly, after several days, the "Baixiang Ren" "Small Collapsed Cake" acted arbitrarily, deciding to marry her alone yesterday and leading several hooligans to hire a rickshaw. At 11:00 AM yesterday, they went to Liu Yunxian's home on Dajing Road and forcibly pushed Xu Yunzhen onto the rickshaw and carried her to a certain hotel in the French Concession. At that time, Mr. and Mrs. Liu Yunxian were not at home. When Ms. Liu Xu returned home and learned that "Small Collapsed Cake" had forcibly abducted her, which was no different from kidnapping, she followed her to the French Concession and reported to the Songshan Road Police Station. The police arrested "Small Collapsed Cake" and Liu Yunzhen together. According to Ms. Liu Xu, they had only talked about the marriage for a few days, and she had not agreed, so how could he forcibly abduct her? She requested punishment. According to "Small Collapsed Cake," he had already paid 60 yuan in betrothal gifts and presented the eight characters for Liu Yunzhen's age written on the cigarette pack as proof that the other party had provided them. Now they were reneging on the marriage, and he requested compensation for all losses. After questioning, the police chief found that both parties were at fault. Liu Yunzhen was still under the custody of Liu Xu, and they were ordered to sue each other in court.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Impostor Masquerades as Lawyer Ma Junshuo, Advertising for a Clerk; More than a Hundred Applicants; Lawyer Ma Declares It Is Not True - The Ring Leader He Jisheng is Repeatedly Disturbed and Arrested <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Ma Junshuo, from Nantong, lives at No. 81, Liulin Villa, Yuyuan Road, and has an office at No. 405, Mainland Commercial Field. On the 20th of this month, in the advertisement column of a certain newspaper, there was suddenly an advertisement for a lawyer hiring a clerk, the content of which was roughly as follows: "A certain lawyer now intends to hire two clerks, with a monthly salary of 50 yuan, including room and board, regardless of gender or qualifications, as long as they are fluent in Chinese and can write in small regular script. Applicants should come to No. 81, Liulin Villa, Yuyuan Road, between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM every day for an interview." Since the advertisement was published, dozens of people went to apply that day. At that time, lawyer Ma did not know that someone was secretly playing tricks. After being reported, he inquired with the applicants and learned the truth, and then declared to each applicant that it was not true and dispersed them. On the one hand, he reported to the General Patrol Room and the Jing'an Temple Patrol Room, requesting an investigation. On the other hand, Ma Junshuo published a statement in the newspaper. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 21st, people still went to Ma's door, and there were even more than the previous day, reaching more than a hundred men and women. Among them, one person in charge, named He Jisheng (He Shiping), 34 years old, from Shaoxing, who was a doctor at the Postal Workers' Union, knocked on the door and entered, wanting to see lawyer Ma. Ma's younger sister, Ma Shuxian, met him instead. When asked about the purpose of the application, he replied that this matter was a trick by a villain and was not true. The people then withdrew, but in recent days, He has gone to Ma's residence and office to harass him, claiming that he has suffered considerable losses because of this matter. Moreover, the day of the application happened to be a heavy rain, and his clothes were soaked and the round-trip fare was not small. Lawyer Ma should be responsible for compensation, otherwise there will be considerable means to deal with him. The words were threatening and bordering on extortion. Ma then reported to the police again, and Detective Wang Yubin secretly investigated. The afternoon before yesterday, He Jisheng went to Ma's office again and was arrested by Detective Wang and taken to the Jing'an Temple Patrol Room for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to Criminal Division Eight of the First Special Court. The police prosecuted He Jisheng according to Article 370, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law for attempted extortion by intimidation. Then, Kungpuchi lawyer Gan Jingxian claimed that after the police received Ma Junshuo's report on April 20, they went to the newspaper office to investigate. According to reports, the advertisement was sent by the Nanyang Advertising Agency on Fuzhou Road. The detectives then went to Nanyang to inquire and presented a draft paper with the seal of lawyer Ma Junshuo. Now, Ma has identified that the seal is actually forged. The defendant in this case has repeatedly gone to Ma's home and office to see Ma Junshuo, and was met by clerk Chen Yaozu. According to the defendant's</p>
<p>statement, he had suffered losses because Ma had advertised for a clerk</p>
<p>and Ma should compensate him, and he often pressed him by telephone. Ma reported to the police, who sent detectives to arrest the defendant. Now, because the investigation of this case needs to continue, it is requested that it be approved to be rescheduled. Subsequently, Ma Junshuo complained about the above situation, and said that he had recently not offended anyone and that he did not know the defendant at all. Furthermore, Ma Shuxian, Ma Junshuo's sister, testified that the defendant had repeatedly come to the house to find her brother, and I met him instead. When asked what he was doing there, he hesitated and also referred to me as Miss Li, I don't know why. When He Jisheng, the defendant, was interrogated, he claimed that he was a volunteer doctor at the Postal Workers' Union. Because his income was small, he was happy to go to apply after seeing the newspaper advertising for Ma Lawyer to hire a clerk with a monthly salary of fifty yuan. When he arrived, he saw many people surrounding Ma's door. He knocked on the door and entered to ask. Miss Ma said that it was not true. I then returned. Yesterday afternoon, I went to Ma Lawyer's office alone, intending to ask Ma to find a position as a public relations officer, which is why I was arrested. There was no act of fraud. After Liu Yugui, the judge, compared the defendant's handwriting in court, he recognized that the handwriting on the forged original draft of the clerk recruitment and the names on the fabricated wedding invitation were entirely his own handwriting. He then ordered that the trial be rescheduled for seven days and the defendant was sent back to custody.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Dumping of Japanese Calcium Carbonate in China <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The New Sound Agency reports that China's industrial chemical calcium carbonate has long relied on supplies from foreign merchants in Japan, the United States, and Germany. Later, Chinese companies and manufacturers producing calcium carbonate were established in Shanghai, including Da Zhonghua Xinye and Zhao Xin. Therefore, the raw materials used by factories such as Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory are supplied by Da Zhonghua. However, other manufacturers still use foreign goods due to their lower prices. According to industrial sources, the Shanghai calcium carbonate market is currently expanding with significant Japanese trade influence. American and German products, though of high quality, are expensive, leading to slow sales. Chinese products are not inferior to those from the US and Germany, but the Japanese are using dumping strategies to suppress us. Last spring, prices ranged between four and five yuan, but this year, due to competitive dumping, they have fallen to two yuan four jiao to three yuan five jiao. Recently, it was also heard that a batch had arrived in Shanghai from a certain Japanese import ship.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Yu Junsong's Lawsuit and Verdict: Second Trial Finds Him Not Guilty <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Local obstetrician Yu Junsong was sued by lawyer Tian Heming last year and was found not guilty by the Shanghai First Special District Court. Tian appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, which also found Yu Junsong not guilty and dismissed the appeal. The Second Branch of the High Court's Criminal Judgment No. 469 was issued yesterday. The key points are as follows: Appellant: Tian Heming, Agent Lawyer: Huang Yingrong, Defendant: Yu Junsong, Defense Lawyer: Jiang Yiping. The above-listed appellant filed an appeal against the first instance judgment of the Shanghai First Special District Court on January 16, 1934, in a case involving the defendant's negligence leading to death. The court's judgment is as follows: (Verdict) Appeal dismissed. (Reason) It is undisputed by both parties that the appellant's wife, Gu Liyi, died of dysentery after childbirth, and the cause was both amoebic and bacillary dysentery. The only point to be investigated is whether the defendant knew it was bacillary dysentery and whether he treated it according to the treatment for bacillary dysentery. According to the defendant, on August 4, 1933, Gu Liyi had diarrhea and a high fever. Her stool was sent to Zhu Yanggao for microscopic examination, and amoebae were found. In addition to injecting emetine for amoebic dysentery, he also injected 20 cc of serum for bacillary dysentery. On the 5th, Zhu Yanggao reported that there was bacillary dysentery and suggested injecting 20 cc of serum, citing report No. 4092 as evidence. Therefore, the appellant's argument that the defendant never knew there was bacillary dysentery is unfounded. Even if the serum injection on the 4th was before Zhu Yanggao's report, it is common for a doctor to suspect bacillary dysentery based on experience and observation and to try an injection first to observe the reaction. As for the claim that Zhu Yanggao's report No. 4092 was forged, the Forensic Institute has identified it as having been torn from the same stub number and not added later. Zhu Yanggao also explained in court that the minus sign on the form and the different signature pointed out in the鉴定书 were due to the use of stub No. 4088, which was the stool sent on the 4th, for cultivation, hence the two lines indicating no check, and the latter was due to carelessness. He cited stub numbers 3372 and 3385 as evidence to show that he had signed like this before. The examination of No. 4092 used stool from No. 4088 for cultivation and was not related to No. 4091. Therefore, Zhu Yanggao's report is not questionable. However, the appellant also claimed that no serum injections were given on the 6th and 7th, which was inappropriate. According to the defendant, the appellant thought the serum was too expensive and did not want to inject it, as evidenced by Qiu Lizhen's statement about how the appellant prevented the serum injection, and Zhang Baoying's statement that on the 8th, when she was discharged from the hospital, the appellant said that Dr. Yu had ruined the injection. Tao Chengfan said that on the 7th, while visiting the patient, he heard two parties arguing, one wanting an injection and the other refusing, and after the dispute, the doctor told him that he was a lawyer. Furthermore, the appellant admitted in the first trial that on the 4th and 5th, the defendant wanted to inject serum, but he thought it was fraud because it had not been tested on the 4th, so how could he know there was a need to inject serum. For ordinary dysentery, there is amoeba, so emetine can be injected, and the appellant bought the serum himself and returned it to the hospital. Therefore, the defendant's statement that the appellant did not want to inject because it was too expensive is not false. As a result, the defendant, in response to the court's question of why he did not force him or ask him to leave the hospital, replied, "I talked to him, and he said that as a lawyer, what he said is always the law, and I have no way." This is also the truth. The appellant's intention to blame the defendant is unreasonable. According to Article 384 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is released. April 18, 1934, Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Presiding Judge: Yu Hua, Judge: Zhao Zheng鏜, Judge: Zhou Han. This document is certified as identical to the original. Clerk: Shen.</p>

<p>The Buddhist Radio Station has specially invited Mr. Zhang Ci, the president of Guanghua University, to lecture on Chinese studies every Wednesday from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM. On the 25th, he lectured on the three religions of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, which have the same source in philosophy, with Buddhism being the most extensive. Recently, it has been generally believed that Buddhism is close to advocating emptiness, but in fact, Buddhism emphasizes self-benefit and benefiting others. It is also what Confucianism calls sincerity, rectifying the heart, and cultivating oneself, and then one can manage the family, govern the country, and pacify the world. If one can sacrifice oneself to save the world, it is the main purpose of Buddhism to practice the Bodhisattva path. This time, only the outline was mentioned. In the future, it is appropriate to speak of those who have a unified system. Listeners will surely welcome it very much.</p>

<p>Publication of "Answers to Questions on Stamp Tax." The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to various trade associations stating: "Stamp tax is a good tax recognized by all countries. Paying it according to law is the duty of every citizen. However, merchants, not understanding the meaning of the regulations, sometimes affix stamps incorrectly on account books and documents, resulting in severe penalties. Those discussing this find it troubling. The Chamber has therefore collected common questions about stamp duty encountered in commerce and compiled them into a book, "Answers to Questions on Stamp Tax," divided into fifteen categories, totaling over eighty items. It contains detailed explanations of unfair penalties and appeal procedures, providing a practical reference for businesses regarding stamp duty payment. The price is fifteen cents per copy. It is hoped that you will notify your members to purchase them directly."</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e190">How to Collect and Discern International News (3) <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Over the past two days, some principles for discerning international news have been briefly introduced. Today, I will continue to offer principles and briefly touch on how to read magazines, editorials, etc. - Editor</p>
<p>Fourth, understand the exploratory function of news. For example, before the Manchurian puppet state changed its system, Japan deliberately released many [rumors] to test the international atmosphere. Recently, Japan, wanting to further invade China, specifically released a statement on April 17th by the Japanese Foreign Ministry to the great powers [prohibiting interference in China]. Both are using news as a diplomatic precursor. Naturally, after the exploration, if it does not encounter a major blow, then direct action follows. Otherwise, it may temporarily ease up and switch to another policy. Exploration plays a significant role when diplomacy encounters major setbacks. At this time, news released by news agencies often deliberately spreads an optimistic atmosphere to ease diplomatic difficulties. In short, a country's news always closely echoes its diplomatic policy, and exploration is mostly used during periods of hesitation in diplomatic proceedings. Therefore, we should not regard [exploration] as merely [exploration] but also pay attention to the development of the news.</p>
<p>Fifth, the so-called development of news refers to the process of an international event, which is often overlooked by newspaper readers. In Chinese newspapers, because of the lack of systematic discussions, this difficulty is especially felt. We should pay attention to the time of news releases in daily newspapers and the many news items related before and after this news. We should not treat each day's news as fixed but seek to understand a news item in its context. Regarding this point, daily newspapers often fail to meet the readers' expectations. Daily newspapers themselves naturally know this is a deficiency. The remedy is mostly to include [foreign dispatches], such as the Shen Bao's [foreign dispatches], Xinwen Bao, and Min Bao's [European dispatches], or to publish a [weekly intelligence] or write a more systematic monograph or editorial to provide readers with systematic knowledge. Therefore, these dispatches, essays, and commentaries should be read carefully.</p>
<p>Sixth, and lastly, it should be noted that the news printed in newspapers of various countries rarely has absolute objective independence. It always undergoes some consideration and modification to suit its own political views and foreign policy. Even if it is not a government-run newspaper, it still cannot publish news that violates the fundamental principles of the country. Therefore, readers should not assume that everything published by private newspapers is completely reliable. For example, Reuters will never publish that Tibetan soldiers invaded the rear of the British Empire, and Havas will not point out that the Nine Small Islands indeed belong to China. Rengo and Shimbun Rengo will not regard the Japanese Foreign Ministry's statement on April 17th as a Japanese conspiracy to monopolize China. Not only them, but even private British, French, and Japanese newspapers, which usually boast of their objective stance and no political backing, dare not do so. Everything is related to politics. Newspapers now are especially a political tool and cannot have supra-political international news. Even if some news is indeed true in itself but does not cater to the rulers and suddenly takes a unique stance, it must represent a kind of politics. Therefore, international researchers standing in an objective position, if they want to clarify right and wrong, should first wash away some of the added things from the upper layers for each international event.</p>
<p>Seventh, do not neglect the newspapers' records of the words and actions of political figures. A short message can sometimes contain great significance. Roosevelt's national policy is often decided on yachts, and Herriot also likes to travel, having visited Spain and Moscow, which improved Franco-Soviet relations. Other international exchanges, such as politicians being sick, wealthy people hosting guests, royal marriages, art expositions, tour groups, sightseeing teams, exchange professors, etc., are sometimes particularly noteworthy. As for Semenov (leader of the White Russians) running from Japan to Harbin and Litvinov going from Moscow to Washington, they have extraordinary significance.</p>
<p>In addition, I must provide some tips on magazines, essays, editorials, and the like.</p>
<p>Generally, these things have a certain system when discussing an international event, making it easier to obtain an overview of an event compared to reading a daily newspaper. However, these things are always several days or several dozens of days slower than telegrams and cannot be as fast as daily newspapers. Needless to say, these things are essential reading for those who study international issues. But the propaganda effect of these things is also stronger than a telegram or several news items. Readers are easily captivated by them. All of these things are political, consciously promoting a certain political position. When selecting this part of the material, it is best to also select the opposing views for comparison. Readers should especially pay attention to the background of such publications and the party affiliations of the authors.</p>
<p>In short, the observation of international news often involves inference from the opposite, side, or before and after, rather than directly looking at the front. Therefore, under the current system, everything must be understood in contradictions, and one cannot listen to only one side's opinion. The most important thing to pay attention to is that everything must be understood as a process, finding the main clues that promote the international situation.</p>
<p>The above points are merely things that the editor has written off the cuff. Naturally, the methods of distinguishing international news are not limited to this. But if intelligent readers can fully apply the above points, it would be quite impressive. Distinguishing the truth or falsehood of news is not a technical problem but requires some academic training. Therefore, I hope readers will not neglect the study of the most basic theories of social science.</p>
<p>We hope to have other opportunities soon to discuss this issue in detail further. (End)</p>

<p>This time, the men's track and field events and the women's track and field three championships will be dominated by Central University. Xu Biao, Liu Yingjun, Ge Qu Kang, Hu Shixuan, Yang Chengcan, Deng Kanshun, Li Disheng, and the new Yang Daogui are all temporary famous choices, with many talents, making them the champion of each school. Only three schools have joined the women's division, with two from Daxia, five from Guanghua, and eight from Central, Central is firmly in control. Fudan's Gu Zaiping and Liang Tiancheng are also excellent choices. Jinan University's strength in track events is still good, with Huang Feilong, Zeng Rongzhong, and Huang Tianan being the main forces. Daxia's Wu Jinqi and Chen Xingpei can both score points. Guanghua may win the track championship. Dong Shuzhao's middle distance, Tao Yingjie's hurdles, and Dong Huang Yinchu's sprints are all outstanding. However, the strength of each school is scattered, and Central will definitely win three championships in a row.</p>

<p>Education News: External Ministry of Education Inspection: A Record of the Return Visit to Beijing by Higher Education Personnel: The Ministry of Education has had a consistent policy of reorganization in recent years for higher education, striving for improvement. This time, it dispatched six commissioners (plus Hao Gengsheng, a supervisor inspecting physical education) to various provinces and cities to inspect public and private colleges and universities. This is the first time since the establishment of the Republic of China. Previously, when Ren Hongjun was in charge of the Higher Education Department of the former Beijing Ministry of Education, he intended to conduct inspections of higher education, and a committee had already been organized, but it never materialized. Since the departure of the ministry's dispatched inspectors, their movements have been repeatedly reported in newspapers throughout the country. Now, nearly two months later, the commissioners have completed their missions. Sun, Guo, Chen, and Liu, who returned to Beijing last, reported to the ministry on the 25th. Upon hearing the news, the reporter made a special trip to inquire about the inspection. They were received, and a summary of the situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>Inspection Personnel: The general inspection team consisted of Chen Kezhong, Sun Guofeng, Liu Yingshi, and Guo Youshou. Hao Gengsheng specialized in inspecting physical education (Jinan and Qingdao were not visited). Zhou Tianfang also participated in the inspection of Beijing and Tianjin. Pang Jingzhou was responsible for inspecting medicine. Chen Kezhong is the director of the Natural Science Group of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, and Liu Yingshi is the chief editor of Book Review. Sun Guofeng, Guo Youshou, and Zhou Tianfang are all specialists in the Ministry of Education. Hao Gengsheng is a physical education supervisor for the Ministry of Education, and Pang Jingzhou is a famous doctor in Shanghai who once served as the president of Tongde Medical School (specializing in inspecting medical colleges and medical vocational schools). Liu, Guo, Chen, and Sun are natives of Jiangsu, Sichuan, Fujian, and Liaoning provinces, respectively, which is a coincidence, representing the four directions: east, west, south, and north.</p>
<p>Inspection Locations: Six provinces, including Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, and Anhui, as well as three cities, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Beijing, were within the scope of the inspection. They departed from Beijing on March 6th. As of today, out of the 52 days, excluding the national mourning for Sun Yat-sen and the memorial day of Huanghuagang and seven Sundays, and seven days of spring break, there were 36 days available for inspection work. A portion of these 36 days was spent traveling. The journey took eight days and six nights, plus five and a half days. Pang Jingzhou went south after going to Baoding, then Kaifeng from Jinan to Beijing.</p>

In total, eight national schools, thirteen provincial schools, sixteen registered private schools, and thirteen closed and unregistered schools were inspected, totaling fifty schools.</p>
<p>Scope of Inspection: In addition to the specific issues that the Ministry of Education instructed to investigate at each school, the general scope of inspection included the following items: (A) In terms of administration, matters related to general affairs, academic affairs, accounting, and registration were included. In accounting, the focus was on whether the actual expenditure and distribution of funds were reasonable.

For private schools, deposit slips for the foundation were also reviewed.

<p>Ministry of Education Orders Elementary and Middle Schools to Emphasize Arithmetic and Natural Sciences: Cannot Recite Literary Chinese or Add English and Japanese: (Nanjing, 26th) The Ministry of Education ordered the education departments of all provinces and cities: Recently, it has been found that some local junior high schools and elementary schools designate classics and force students to recite them, and some elementary schools recite literary Chinese or add old subjects such as English and Japanese. This not only violates the regulations and curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools promulgated by the Ministry, but also increases the burden on students, causing the performance in arithmetic and natural sciences to decline. (According to reports from various provinces and cities, the results of local joint examinations show that the performance in arithmetic and natural sciences is the worst). This is very wrong. It is hereby ordered that the departments instruct their subordinate public and private middle schools and inform the affiliated primary and secondary schools of national universities in the region to comply with laws and regulations in all course subjects and the content of Chinese and national language. Superintendents are responsible for strict supervision. If the above situation is found, it should be corrected immediately. Comply immediately.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Formulates Standard Equipment for Middle School Science and Chemistry: (Nanjing, 26th) The Ministry of Education formulated standards for physics equipment and chemistry equipment for middle schools, which were announced on the 26th.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Plans to Prohibit Students from Smoking Cigarettes: (Nanjing, 26th) The Ministry of Education plans to order the education departments of all provinces and cities to instruct their subordinate schools to strictly prohibit students from smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p>Ye Suzhong, New Director of Zhejiang Education Department, Takes Office on May 1st: Chen Bulei, member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and Director of the Education Department, requested to resign due to poor health and the need for recuperation. This was approved by the Central Government, and Ye Suzhong, Executive Member of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters, was appointed to succeed him. After receiving the order, Director Ye attended the 676th committee meeting of the provincial government on the 24th and has decided to take office on May 1st. It is reported that Director Ye's education plan for the province will follow the established policies of his predecessor. The staff of the department will not be changed unless they resign voluntarily. It is also reported that Director Chen left Hangzhou after his resignation was approved and returned to his hometown. He visited Xiaoshi Middle School and Yin County Girls' Middle School in Ningbo the day before yesterday, and it is rumored that he will come to Hangzhou today to handle the handover in the department and go to Shanghai at the beginning of the month to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Jiangyin County Education Administrative Meeting: Principals Request Clearance of Seven Months of Arrears: The Jiangyin Education Bureau's 23rd Annual County Education Administrative Meeting was convened by Director Xiong of the Education Bureau on the 25th at the Education Bureau. In addition to the ex-officio members of the county government and county party headquarters, overseas members such as Wu Yan, Wu Yuandi, and Chen Mingcen were also invited. Important proposals: (1) Request to establish a county library at the Southeast Rural School; (2) How to receive, clean up, execute, and store the property rights of the Jinling Examination Hall, which have fallen into other hands; (3) The practice of farmers and tenants using strings of cash to offset rent hinders collection, so please discuss relief measures. At the meeting, Director Xiong reported that the expenses of various agencies and schools, up to the end of September last year, totaled 69,121.154 yuan, and the amount of loans transferred was 41,006.37 yuan. To date, 4,386.93 yuan of arrears have been cleared, and 34,887.347 yuan of principal and interest on the transferred loans have been repaid. The remaining arrears will be cleared according to the department's order. The funds for this semester are insufficient by nearly 30,000 yuan due to the use of income from the previous semester to repay the transferred loans and clear arrears, totaling nearly 40,000 yuan. A plan has been drafted and submitted to the county government meeting for approval, and it is expected that funds can be distributed monthly and on time, so that arrears will not occur again.

<p>Engineers' Society Inspection Team Passes Through Yichang: According to Yichang Aviation Express, the Chinese Engineers' Society, at the invitation of the Sichuan authorities, organized a Sichuan inspection team, which departed from Shanghai on the 15th of this month, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the team passed through Yichang in the morning (i.e., April 21st). The reporter, considering the importance of the team's mission, made a special trip to the Minguigui Company's boat to inquire about everything and met with Mr. Hu Shuhua, the head of the team. According to him, the situation is as follows: 1. Organization: One head of the team, one deputy head, one secretary, three staff members, and three photography staff members. The entire team is divided into nine groups: coal, copper, iron, water conservancy, water power, railway, highway, cement, salt, sugar industry, textile, paint, drug manufacturing, telecommunications, and electricity. Each group has one report editor and one photographer. 2. Action: The entire team has 24 members (another member is already in Chongqing). In addition to each person's specific responsibilities, all team actions are decided through meetings. The team spirit is taken into consideration in every aspect. The team is reluctant to express opinions on the development of Sichuan's industry before conducting an on-site investigation. 3. Work: All team members are experts in their fields. They plan to use their knowledge and experience to conduct academic investigations and contributions in order to seek the development of Sichuan's industry. It is said that they have drafted a regional inspection route and brought various instruments for on-site surveys.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department Dispatches Personnel to Inspect Secondary Education Throughout the Province: Zhou Yigeng and Others Arrive in Shanghai from Nantong: In order to understand the current situation of secondary education in Jiangsu Province and improve it, the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department dispatched personnel to various counties and cities on the 20th of this month for inspection. Yesterday, Zhou Yigeng, Jin Chongru, and Xie Weidong arrived in Shanghai from Nantong. According to Mr. Zhou, Nantong has always been known as a model for handicrafts. Since Zhang Jian's death, the area has lacked a leading figure for unified leadership. In addition, the Nantong cloth woven on wooden looms, which used to be sold outside the customs, is now in danger of bankruptcy due to the interruption of sales. Social, economic, and educational conditions, which are interrelated, are also deteriorating. However, the 13 provincial secondary schools in the area are still able to maintain the status quo, and the annual income and expenditure are balanced. Management is strict, equipment is considered perfect, and students have a lot of extracurricular activities, especially physical education, which has developed more than in previous years. The three of us are only inspecting secondary schools. Other normal schools have special commissioners. We will transfer to Suzhou for inspection soon and then return to the province to report. The improvement plan is not convenient to publish yet.</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Held the Second Public Speech of the Year Yesterday: At Wu Ben Girls' High School, Mr. Dong Renjian Gave a Speech on Civic Training and the New Life Movement: The Municipal Education Bureau held the second public speech of the year at Wu Ben Girls' High School yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Mr. Dong Renjian, a professor at Great China University, gave a speech entitled "Civic Training and the New Life Movement." Over 500 teachers from various schools attended. An excerpt of his speech is as follows: (1) What is a citizen? In terms of book definition, public is the opposite of private, so a citizen is not a private person. When a person is born, there is no concept of public. As he grows up, he becomes socialized, humanized, or grouped with parents, family, school, and even the social body. Therefore, a citizen can be said not to be a private person, but purely socialized. (2) What is training? Training and education are often used interchangeably, but training is a mechanical, action-oriented habit without thought. It teaches people how and what to do, while education is thoughtful. It not only teaches people how and what to do, but also teaches people why. However, the training in civic training is definitely not animal training. (3) What is new life? Life itself is neither new nor old, and there is no absolute newness or absolute oldness. Therefore, the new life is just a transformation of the old life. (4) What is a movement? There are two types of movements: one is propaganda-oriented, and the other is education-oriented. The movement of the New Life Movement is not only propaganda but also educational work. Civic training and the New Life Movement have the same goals and methods. The goal is education, and the method is transformation. Therefore, civic training is the New Life Movement, and the New Life Movement is civic training. Its starting point is in elementary school. Neither is book knowledge, nor is it animal training, nor is it a moral lesson, nor is it sectarian propaganda. Its implementation principle is, first, to make children understand what the current moral standards of society are; second, to make them realize it; and third, to help them so that they have no difficulties.</p>
<p>Yang Binru Appointed Director of Nanhui Education Bureau: Gu Chuanzhang, the Director of the Education Bureau of this county, recently submitted his resignation to the Education Department, which has now been approved. According to a directive, the county government recommended a candidate for the successor. It was learned yesterday that the department appointed Yang Binru, the current supervisor of this county, to fill the position. However, Yang is currently in Wujin for exchange inspections and is expected to return to the county to take office within a few days.</p>
<p>Ren Shen Class Alumni Association of Guanghua University: The alumni of the Ren Shen class of Guanghua University are scattered in all directions.

Zhang Hualian, Zhu Youxian, Cai Xianmin, Dai Xinghua, Yang Si, Qian Jiahua, and others were elected as preparatory committee members. The inaugural meeting is scheduled to be held at 12:00 noon on April 29th at the dining hall of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA.</p>
<p>Special Issue: Tong Xingbai Speaks on the Problem of Knowing and Doing in the New Life Movement (II) by Chen Dongbai: In Chinese history, from the Zhou and Qin dynasties to a hundred years ago, in this long period of two thousand years, the lifestyle of society was originally very disciplined and very restrained. There is no need to talk about the spiritual aspect. Even in the four aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, the ancients paid more attention to it than we do today when we talk about the new life. For clothing, not only was it neat, clean, simple, and plain, but also the quality, color, and manufacturing method of the clothes had to be divided into grades, either based on titles, such as the emperor's clothes, the minister's clothes, and the people's clothes, or based on ceremonies, such as court clothes, sacrificial clothes, wedding clothes, and mourning clothes. The strictness of the rules is hard to describe in a word. Mencius said, "Those who are fifty years old can wear silk clothes." It can be seen that there was still a distinction between age and material. As for food, what we talk about in the new life is cleanliness, simplicity, and hygiene, but the ancients were not only like this, but also had a way of eating and etiquette of eating, without any difference. Confucius can be regarded as the standard figure of China. Later generations regarded him as typical, but Confucius was very particular about eating and drinking. "He would not sit if the mat was not straight" and "He would not eat if the meat was not cut properly." Even not eating at the wrong time, not eating overnight, and not eating rotten food can already show the strictness of one aspect. The same is true for housing. In ancient times, the method of building houses had a fixed procedure, and the equipment inside was also limited. Guan Zhong assisted Duke Huan, dominated the princes, rectified the world, and respected the royal family. History praised him greatly, but the house he lived in was criticized because it exceeded the limit. (Three returns and back stains) As for transportation, the ancients were also very particular about it, with fixed rules for seniority. You must walk on the main road, the so-called "Do not take shortcuts." You must walk on the right path, the so-called "Li Ming Sheng Mu, Zeng Zi did not enter." "The town called Chaoge, Mo Zhai returned the car," it can be seen that the ancients' activities in clothing, food, housing, and transportation were all in rules. Is the lifestyle rule talked about in the New Life Movement so strict? Because of this, although the Chinese society in the past did not have a community organization, and did not have precise laws, but because there were strict rules in the lifestyle, although the society had no formal organization, it had a spiritual union, so the society was not chaotic, and the order was quite solemn. This is all the rule of life, that is, maintaining society with etiquette, and its effectiveness is universal and deep, and it is greater than the law. The law sometimes ends, but the power of etiquette is to impress people invisibly. However, this kind of rule, with excessive red tape, can be done in the leisure class of feudal society. To implement it in today's society, many things are also felt to be out of line with modern life, so we want to promote a new life.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Notes of a Princess's Perfume Record by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou: The internal space of this locomotive seemed to be twice as large as that of an ordinary locomotive; otherwise, how could it accommodate seven workers inside? - Although, in fact, not all seven people were working. In the half of the service car behind the coal-water car, you couldn't find a stool, a chair, or a table, in order to prevent these workers from sitting down privately when no one was paying attention. Now, let's talk about the eunuch-style palace robes worn by these workers. Of course, they absolutely couldn't keep these clothes clean. In less than half a day, they were covered in soot and grease. When this happened, they had to change immediately. The old ones were thrown out of the car - no one would have thought that this was the clothing worn by a train worker - and new ones were put on. These expenses were all borne by the Ministry of Interior. Then, readers may ask, why didn't the workers take such good clothes back and wash them clean, even if they were stained with grease? However, they also knew that after this time, they didn't know when they would drive the train for the Empress Dowager again; and in ordinary times, they would be ridiculed by their relatives and friends if they wore such clothes. Originally, they were not worthy to wear them! Before the Empress Dowager started the train, she knew almost all the important points of how the train would move; although she had never personally visited the locomotive, she had asked all the questions she wanted to ask, and she had also ordered the train to run forward and backward in front of her, so she believed that this train would not cause her any danger. Another point is also very interesting. Her memory was particularly strong. Months later, she could often tell people in great detail about the various situations she had experienced on the train, and they were all very minute. (21)</p>
<p>Burial of Clothes and Hats by Li Hong: After the four Boy Scouts held a burial of clothes and hats, Mr. Xiang Songmao will also hold a burial of clothes and hats recently. The January 28th Japanese military riot was planned. They wanted to use force to suppress our country's anti-Japanese boycott movement, so they destroyed the Commercial Press, because it was our country's only cultural institution; the Chinese people liked to use Gubeng soap, which made the business of inferior soap plummet, which was also a major reason for Xiang's tragic murder. According to eyewitnesses, when Xiang was劫 to the Japanese military headquarters, the Japanese official questioned Xiang as to why he wanted to organize volunteers and why he wanted to boycott Japanese goods. Xiang said loudly; [I am Chinese, of course I want to love China; you and I are of the same race, we should coexist and prosper; why do you want to forcibly occupy our country's land? Harm the lives of our people? ······] This remark increased the enemy's anger, so Xiang was tragically murdered at this time, and even his corpse was destroyed by the enemy! Mr. Shi Liangcai said in his eulogy to Xiang; [Things will not change if the quality is not pure, people will not know the ambition if they are not involved in difficulties; I have known Mr. Songmao for ten years, only knowing that he is diligent and thrifty in his life, but unexpectedly he used righteousness and courage to die; alas! Mr. is the appearance of today, the heart of the ancient times. A burial ceremony in a national crisis, I think the Chinese people cannot but be moved by it!</p>
<p>China is Not Easy to Understand by Xun Zi: Pearl S. Buck, the pride of the American literary world, is an American woman who grew up in China. Her works, because they are all set in China and suit the curious appetite of Americans, are popular for a while. She not only drew huge royalties but also won some kind of award, which can be said to be a win-win for fame and fortune! However, although her works understand China better than ordinary European and American writers, the materials she uses are nothing more than the tyranny of warlords, the frequency of floods and droughts, and the suffering of peasants. In other words, she still depicts the ugly side of China! However, there are many people in the Chinese literary world who praise this foreign female writer. China is really difficult to understand, and it deserves the title of a mysterious ancient country in the East. Ms. Pearl S. Buck not only saw the ugly side of China, but she grew up in China and thought that she had a deep understanding of the lives of the Chinese people, but sometimes she still doesn't get the right answer. Recently, someone translated her article [Mother] in the Evening News. In describing the mother after giving birth, it said that she fell into a deep sleep; - I have read the original text, but I have forgotten it. The general meaning is like this, which is correct - This is completely wrong with the Chinese habit of giving birth. According to the old Chinese habit, after a woman gives birth, she must hold up her upper body and not be allowed to fall asleep within 24 hours. Traditional habits tell them that if they fall asleep, the blood stasis will rise and it will be fatal; unless Western-style childbirth is used recently, the doctor gives the parturient a shot before she is allowed to fall asleep. It is not easy to understand another country, especially for foreigners in general for China!</p>
<p>Four Company Commanders in Northeast China by Zhang Henshui: Chapter 28: A Coincidence at the Same Time, Infatuated with Picking Up Handkerchiefs and Diligently Asking About Illnesses, Misunderstanding and Sending Letters: It is quite interesting to study the Spring Festival couplets in this way. After walking through more than a dozen households, I saw a new couplet, which is [Keep anti-Japanese in mind, swear not to share the sky.] The vow and sky characters in the lower couplet are matched with the upper couplet. Although it is not very natural, it can be regarded as the first among the Spring Festival couplets seen everywhere today. Moreover, the author of this method of sloganizing the Spring Festival couplet can be regarded as a man of heart. Looking at this house, it is a small dark gatehouse. Although the courtyard in the door is very small, it is also swept clean. It seems to be a knowledgeable family. As I was looking around, someone suddenly shouted, "Second Master Gan, happy New Year! When did you come back?" When Ji Zhi looked up, it was the old master of Zhao Ziqiang, followed by Guizhi and his mother Jiang. Ji Zhi hurriedly clasped his hands to congratulate him and said happy New Year, but when he saw Guizhi, he immediately thought of what happened on this day last year. That was also when they met on the street. His first sentence was also, "Happy New Year?" I really didn't want to recall what happened last year, but this kind of similar thing led people to not help but think about it in that direction. So his heart skipped a few beats, he quickly glanced at Guizhi, and then he dared not look again. Old Man Zhao smiled and said, "I saw from afar that the Second Master was looking around at the doors of the two houses, is he looking at the Spring Festival couplets? Is there any good article here?" Ji Zhi smiled and said, "When I came back to Haidian, I had nothing to do, so I felt bored sitting at home, so I came out for a walk." Old Man Zhao smiled and said, "If the Second Master has nothing to do, I will invite you to listen to the opera. There are two actors from Tianqiao in this small theater. Don't ask if it is good or bad, it's just for fun anyway. Besides, let you gentlemen also taste what the taste of this popular theater is like?" Ji Zhi originally wanted to refuse. But the last sentence of this old man was a bit coercive. If he didn't go, it would seem that he couldn't be popular. (372)</p>

<p>Smoking by Gu She: Smoking can be said to be the most artistic life, and it can also be said to be the most meaningful life. Think about it, with a cigarette in hand, leisurely reverie, watching the circles of smoke, forgetting the favor and humiliation of the world. Especially on a windy and rainy night, or when several people talk together, or when one person sits alone, it is simply necessary to smoke at this time. If you don’t smoke, I’m afraid you will feel insecure. Therefore, some people call cigarettes, alcohol, and tea the flavors of life, and I think cigarettes can especially be called the monosodium glutamate of monosodium glutamate. Because he can give people a particularly large number of stimulating opportunities, therefore, his monosodium glutamate effect is also particularly large. It can be rightly called the monosodium glutamate of monosodium glutamate in life. People who don’t smoke won’t know the wonderfulness of smoking. The wonderfulness of smoking cannot be described in words. If you don’t believe it, go and try it. As long as you are just addicted, this wonderfulness will gradually [麻着些儿 up] From then on, you will feel that you must smoke after a meal, and you must smoke when going to the toilet. This is still the beginning. Later, you will smoke when reading a book, smoke when reading a newspaper, smoke when writing an article, and especially smoke when sitting alone and thinking. As for good times and beautiful scenery, when you are happy, you must smoke even more. In short, you must smoke in any environment. At this time, you are old enough, and at the same time, you can fully appreciate the wonderfulness of smoking. The taste of cigarettes is bitter and spicy, which is most hated by people who don’t smoke. However, because the taste of cigarettes is bitter and spicy, the wonderfulness of smoking is so intense.</p>
<p>A Study of the Miscellaneous Talk 硯 汭 by Wuliao Ke: Preface to the Record of Yanyuanzhai Note by Wuliao Ke, the owner of Yanyuanzhai. Everyone has interests. In addition to work, there must be something left. If there is something left, it cannot but be entrusted. Books, paintings, musical instruments, chess, gambling, and wine are all places where interest is entrusted. I entrust it to the 硯砚 only. At first, I only entrusted it occasionally. Later, I entrusted it from time to time and became almost obsessed. Yesterday, I happened to see the article of my senior fellow villager Mr. Zhang Zifan, which said, "I first liked ancient bricks. Master Lu Danghu said that it was the most serious thing to indulge in things and lose one's ambition." I also saw the article of Dongpo Jushi, which said, "I have two hands, one of which can write, and I have three 硯砚. Why do I have so many?" Mr. Shi Yushan also said, "It is clumsy to write and laborious to 硯砚. Isn't it confusing?" How confusing I am! From then on, I stopped watching it. My colleague Gui Lin Kuang Junxiao Song is skilled in iron brushes and is also good at 榻 rubbing. So, I chose a few more beautiful ones and entrusted Kuang Jun to rub and save them. I have even more feelings. The gathering and scattering of things are impermanent. In the past, Ji Shouqiao obtained the 硯砚遗砚 of Pan Jiatang. He once expressed his feelings about Pan's excellence in writing and conduct. His name was spread at home and abroad. However, his children and grandchildren could not keep the legacy of their ancestors. So, he inscribed on its four sides with a natural 硯砚, saying, "I got this 硯砚. Today I treasure and hide it. In the future, I don't know whose hands it will fall into again. The view of the future is just like our view of the past." These words are insightful. Ji's father and son's collection of 硯砚 is exquisite and rich. Their name is famous all over the world and is known abroad. But now it has disappeared and scattered, and I don't know how many times it has been passed on. Is my feeling for Ji today the same as Ji's feeling for Pan in the past? In the late Qing Dynasty, there were many famous 硯砚 collectors in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Try to visit their homes. Is there still one left? Recently, Shen Shiyou's 硯砚林砚林 has become a source of praise and ridicule for the Japanese. Things cannot always gather. It is reasonable. Then, my 硯砚 is not only the caressing and playing in the past, but also the occasional entrustment. Even the hoarding and hiding of it today is not also an occasional entrustment? I really laugh at my nosy self. Recorded by the owner of 硯汭齋 on October 6, the 21st year of the Republic of China. Preliminary remarks: 1. Ancient people had 硯砚谱 硯砚 catalogs and 硯砚史 histories of 硯硯, with various names. However, the catalogs had catalog systems, and the histories had historical examples. For example, Gao Nancun's 硯硯史 compares the 硯硯 to 平凖河渠 平凖 River Channel, 樂律 Yue Lv Music, 天官本紀 Tianguan Benji Astronomical Treatise, 世家等 Shijia Hereditary Houses, etc. Although it is close to a forced association, it is still a legacy of Yuy Yi's art and a literary anecdote. I do not have many 硯砚 in my collection, and I do not have the literary talent to embellish them. Therefore, I dare not call it a catalog or history. I call it a 硯硯 Record, which is a record of the facts. 2. In the past, Tang Hengquan of Lianshui drew 名硯名硯圖 Famous 硯硯 Pictures, crowning it with 太極硯 Taiji 硯砚 and ending it with 井田硯 Jingtian 硯硯. In the middle, he listed 星斗龍鳳山水花卉諸物硯 Starry Sky, Dragon and Phoenix, Landscape, Flowers and Plants, and other things, taking the meaning of 天覆地載中包萬物 Heaven Covering the Earth and Containing All Things to show the meaning of 上下尊卑 upper and lower respect and inferiority, which has a strong meaning of representing the imperial era. My 硯砚 Record lists the older 硯硯 first, because the products of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, although better than before, are still increasingly rare among the old 硯砚. Should be given more attention, so I list the older ones first, only to avoid the meaning of the latter coming first, not biased towards the ancient. It happens from this. Don't believe me, when you feel greasy in your mouth after a meal, you will feel exceptionally refreshed if you smoke a cigarette, which is the first wonderful thing about smoking. Smokers always feel greasy</p>

<p>Local Supplement of the Shenbao Newspaper on [Standards]</p>
<p>Gu Yue</p>
<p>I have been fooled several times by [Standard Time], and today, due to a small matter, I needed to rush home by 2:30. The so-called [Standard Time] clock at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Donghongjiang Road clearly told me it was 1:20. However, the "[standard]" was thus ruined. When I got home, it was exactly 3:00. I am furious! Why call it [Standard]? Could it be that it differs from my home clock by a whole hour?</p>
<p>There are quite a few things called [Standard] now, such as [Standard Company], [Standard Beauty]... It's truly a dazzling array, everything you could want! However, after some investigation, the sports equipment from [Standard Company] doesn't seem any better than those bought from companies that aren't called [Standard], except the prices are higher! Everyone knows that [Standard Beauty] refers to Ms. Xu Lai of the Star Film Company, but I don't understand, is she [standard] in beauty? Character? Art? Too vague! [Standard] is too vague! Moreover, according to what my ears have heard, a star spends at least half of their monthly salary on publicity fees. How strange! Is [Standard Company] called [Standard] because its prices are high? Is [Standard Beauty] called [Standard] because she's willing to spend on publicity? Unreasonable [standards] should be overthrown! Too vague [standards] should be eliminated! At the same time, can [standards] that don't live up to their name still hide away and enjoy their reputation?</p>
<p>From this, we can predict the future of [Standards]. In the near future, we can imagine [Standard Theater], [Standard School], [Standard City], [Standard Province], [Standard National Salvation], shouting all sorts of slogans, the most [standard] [Standard XX]. Yes, perhaps [Standard] will be used in repetition because they think one [Standard] isn't enough to describe its [standard]! [Standard] loses its true meaning and becomes a sacrifice that doesn't live up to its name!</p>
<p>Let's analyze [Standard] further. [Biao] means [Target], [Zhun] means [Accurate], no doubt, everyone knows that! Of course, [Standard] means [Having an accurate target], neither leaning to the left nor leaning to the right, without the slightest error! You say the fulcrum of a balance scale is extremely [standard], absolutely not! Because human ideals are never so perfectly accurate! [Standard] is so rare! How can [Standard] be used carelessly!</p>
<p>Perhaps in the future, [Standard] will be used in reverse by humans, [Standard] becoming [Zhun Biao]! Because humans are inherently contradictory! The more novel, the more it can capture people's attention!</p>
<p>Advertising is becoming more and more sophisticated, and its applications are becoming more and more ingenious! [Standard] is certainly one of the things being exploited, and people's minds are being deceived, truly! Society is full of deception, I feel!</p>
<p>Using deceptive means for the promotion of goods, to attract attention, exploiting the sacredness of [Standard], can still be forgiven! Aimless deception! While exploiting [Standard], that is detestable! That should be a great sin! Because it's dereliction of duty, unwilling to take responsibility! Abandoning one's duty is the source of human sin!</p>
<p>I pity [Standard]'s pure character being sacrificed in this way! I am not just complaining about being late! I just feel it's too pitiful! God's darling! [Standard]!</p>

<p>Ms. Ying</p>
<p>Peach blossoms blooming, willow branches swaying, aren't these two angels representing the arrival of spring in the world?</p>
<p>Yes; the chilling winter has quietly departed, and the bright spring has drifted in. At that time, everything, whether man or woman, is full of seductive allure, driving the other party into a dizzy and disoriented state, even neglecting sleep and food, becoming gaunt and thin. Indeed; this fact tells us very clearly - look!</p>
<p>Women, in the spring sunshine, strip off all the animal skins covering their limbs, replacing them with a close-fitting white gauze cheongsam full of mystery and allure. Whether she is sitting in a car, crossing a bare, pink leg, her mercury-like eyes constantly flirting in all directions, or walking down the street, her high-perched breasts rising and falling like waves, her full hips ceaselessly rotating, rotating. Add to that a smile, even if unintentional, and it will hook your soul to the ninth heaven. Once hooked, your soul will never return, forever and ever following her.</p>
<p>Men, in the spring sunshine, put on a brand new suit, a blood-red bow tie on a snow-white collar. The crimson sunlight enveloping them makes the red look even redder and the white even whiter. Shiny leather shoes, curled oily hair, dazzlingly eye-catching. Whether strolling in a public place or at a crossroads, he can win their hearts. As long as he makes a funny face, then the depths of their hearts will invisibly ripple, and their oval faces will also subtly blush. Naturally! At this time when love is budding and blooming, how could they not want to talk about love? How could they not want to XX? However, they only do it in their hearts? The fire of youth, its power is great! Great! The fire of youth!</p>

<p>Novel Tomorrow (3)</p>
<p>Mu Lin</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I finished writing my diary and went to bed at two o'clock. Mom was already sound asleep, but I couldn't fall asleep no matter what. My hands and feet were cold, and my face was hot. I probably went to bed too late and had a fever. Luckily Mom didn't know, or she would nag again.</p>
<p>The more I couldn't sleep, the more I wanted to sleep, and the more I wanted to sleep, the less I could sleep. Staring blankly at the top of the mosquito net, I vaguely thought of him again. It was as if we were still in the movie theater, but my older sister had left at some point. He leaned close to me, and when the male and female leads on the screen were flirting, he explained the dialogue to me in detail, and made gestures like this and that. I knew he was doing it on purpose, but there was no room to move, so I pretended to be watching the movie and ignored him. However, he boldly grabbed my hand. I glanced at him, but he didn't seem to notice and squeezed even tighter. I wanted to pull it back, but being held by him like that felt strangely comfortable, my heart was pounding, as if I had been electrocuted, and I knew my cheeks must be as red as roses. I didn't dare to turn my head. From the corner of my eye, I saw his eyes gleaming and as terrifying as a tiger. Would he not make any other moves? Thinking like this, I exerted effort to pull my hand back. Sure enough, he pounced on me like a sheep and embraced my body. I was so scared that I cried for help.</p>
<p>Waking up, it was just a dream. My body was drenched in cold sweat, and after a while, it was as hot as fire. I looked at my hands and laughed, why would I have such a frightening dream for no reason? He is my older sister's husband, they love her so much, they are preparing to have children, I can't have delusional thoughts, I want to confess to my older sister, condemn myself, and then quietly fall asleep again.</p>
<p>When Mom woke me up, it was already ten o'clock in the morning. She stood in front of my mosquito net and smiled, scolding me for being a lazy girl and sleeping until this time without wanting to get up. I replied that I didn't feel well. She dropped her smile and reached out to my forehead to test it, [Ah Ying, you have a fever, you must have caught a cold last night. I don't know what time you went to bed? Just lie down quietly for a while.] She tucked the quilt around me and busied herself preparing some Wu Shi Tea, Mom always uses this method to treat fevers. I wanted to reply that it was okay, I would get up in a while, but Mom had already left the bedroom.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I heard Mom talking to someone in the outer room. I thought he had come, so I deliberately coughed loudly, and then I heard Mom ask me, [Ah Ying, do you want tea?] But the second voice disappointed me, it wasn't him, but a voice that was also familiar said, [Really, Miss is sick.]</p>
<p>Mom brought the teacup in, and I asked her who was outside. Mom didn't answer, handed me the teacup, reached out to my forehead and tested it, saying, [Ah Ying, the fever has gone down, sleep well, don't think wildly.]</p>
<p>Having done something guilty myself, it seemed like every word had a thorn. I wanted to ask Mom what she meant by "thinking wildly", but she seemed to have something important to do and went to the outer room, talking to the person I couldn't remember for a moment, their voices even lower and I couldn't make out what they were saying.</p>

<p>(Osaka, Japanese United Press, 26th) As the Far Eastern Games are rapidly approaching, the Japanese swimming team held a record competition at the Koshien Indoor Swimming Pool (25 meters long) at 6 PM on the 25th. On this day, each athlete gave their all to test their abilities, resulting in six new world records and two new Japanese records. In the 800-meter event, which had previously yielded poor results, Makino, Kitamura, and Honda shortened the time to just over nine minutes. Koike broke his own world record in the 200-meter breaststroke, setting an amazing new record of 2 minutes 36.4 seconds. The main results of the day are as follows:</p>

<p>The track and field team from Zhijiang College of Arts and Sciences in Hangzhou is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. The group consists of over 30 people and will stay at Shanghai University. They are scheduled to compete against the track and field team of Shanghai University in Yangshupu at the Shanghai University sports field on the 28th. Zhijiang is renowned in Hangzhou, and at the Zhejiang Provincial Games last year, its athletes set several new records. However, Shanghai University is also considered strong in Shanghai. The competition between the two sides is bound to be spectacular. Sports-loving readers should not miss the opportunity to drive out and watch.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Zhijiang volleyball team is also scheduled to go on the expedition with the army and has arranged friendly matches with Jiaotong University and Shanghai University. Shanghai University and Jiaotong University have a long history in Shanghai, while Zhijiang has always been the leader in Hangzhou. Furthermore, they have several outstanding athletes from Guangdong this semester, who are good at both offense and defense. It is uncertain who will emerge victorious when these strong rivals meet on that day.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Japanese Cabinet Meeting: Saito Advocates Participation, but the Military Expresses Opposition; Soldiers Want to Interfere with Sports – Track and Field Athletes Beaten in the Dark <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo, Japanese United Press, 26th) The early cabinet meeting today began at 2:20 PM. Prime Minister Saito, in his capacity as concurrently serving as the Minister of Education, discussed the issue of attending the Far Eastern Games, stating that since the government has already subsidized the expenses for sending athletes to the Far Eastern Games, it should be considered an established policy and hopes to send athletes as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Military Opposes Participation <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>(Hualian News Agency, Tokyo Correspondent)</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Round Table Conference rejected the participation of the puppet Manchukuo in this Far Eastern Games, the Ministry of the Army was particularly indignant. On the 21st, officer corps within the Tokyo Garrison Headquarters and the First Division submitted rebuttals to Saito, who also serves as the Minister of Education, and the Japan Athletic Association. Also on the 21st, Ono, the gymnastics section chief of the Army Toyama School, convened an emergency meeting of the school's physical education and martial arts instructors. The result was the belief that the participation of Japanese athletes in this Far Eastern Games was a humiliating participation. The officer corps of the school also met at a certain location in the city that night and, after consultation, adopted a common approach with Ono's faction. On the 23rd, they visited Hiranuma, the president of the Athletic Association, and the Ministry of Education to express their opposition to participating in the games. On the other hand, they also sent people to contact nationalistic groups at various universities, guiding the athletic departments of the universities to resolve to oppose participation in the games. The military has extended its coercive hand, and the participation of Japanese athletes in the Far Eastern Games may be aborted. (Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 26th) Lieutenant Colonel Ono, the gymnastics section chief of the Army Toyama School, and other officers held another meeting last night and resolved to oppose the participation of Japanese athletes in the Far Eastern Games. They immediately sent a representative to meet with Principal Fukazawa, seeking his consent. This morning, a statement was issued in the name of the school, opposing the participation of Japanese athletes in the Far Eastern Games.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Athletic Association Encourages Athletes <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>(Dentsu, 26th, Tokyo) The preparatory committee of the Athletic Association for the Far Eastern Games sent an encouraging telegram yesterday to the delegation of athletes gathered in Kobe awaiting departure. The telegram stated that there seem to be various rumors before departure, and it is hoped that they will not be misled and will single-mindedly fulfill the duty of athletes. Regarding the Emperor's Cup, because the Shanghai Conference has decided to abolish the comprehensive athlete system, there is a strong opinion that it is not necessary to maintain the policy. They will first contact the Philippines, the host country, to discuss the method of handling it. Also, there are rumors that Tsuruoka Eikichi, the general manager of the swimming representatives, will resign, but he has denied this.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Athletes Beaten in the Dark <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>(Japanese United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>Osaka) Last night, while the Far Eastern Games track and field athletes Ono (hurdles), Suzuki (javelin), Akabane (javelin), Liu John (discus), and Ogura (decathlon) were taking a walk near the Koshien dormitory, more than a dozen thugs suddenly jumped out of the darkness, all wielding wooden sticks and hitting the athletes indiscriminately. Ono and Suzuki suffered injuries to their right feet, and Akabane's clothes were torn. People inside the dormitory, hearing the emergency, reported to the police department and requested that police officers be dispatched to guard them. Such an ominous incident has occurred in the sacred world of sports, and its impact on the Far Eastern Games is quite worrisome.</p>
