<h3>華北現局的展望</h3>
<p>— 廷</p>
<p>經過千迥百折的平瀋通車問題终於委曲求全而得一從權解决辦法通車實行後關於華北戰區的未了懸案聽說已可根據雙方預約而開始磋商了我們鑒於過去通車問題的種種波折便知道磋商戰區未了懸案而以實行通車爲先决條件其代價不可謂不大可是我們對於磋商結果的期望依然不敢高於常情之推測。</p>
<p>今且假定撤退灤榆區長城各口日僞軍和實行薊灤兩區新舊保安隊換防等問題可以一一辦到不能不說［差强人意］遷延多時的戰區問題却絶不能因之而得根本解决再退一步而就說收關部题罷日軍早在重要各口建築極鞏固的軍事設備僞國方面亦設立了關卡和行政機關收回區區幾個關口仍不免於有名無實而種種糾紛却可以隨時而起又如依據塘沽恊定的口頭約定新編的戰區保安隊實爲九千名現在訓練完竣預備開入戰區的不過八千人而日人却堅持以現駐人數六千名爲限並將輕機關槍列入重武器中而不准携帶只此二端已可想見戰區懸案的解决難了本來在今日而談任何對日交涉不是自認妥恊或退讓總不會有［迎刃而解］的痛快事何况是那盤根錯節的華北問題呢。</p>
<p>我們知道日人侵略華北預定著三個步驟第一步是破壞關山險要已因沿長城戰事的終結而完成了第二步是佈置合圍形勢乃以增兵馬蘭峪和察東的手腕而在着着進行中第三步是擴張潛伏勢力如編制接濟察東灤東的土匪聯絡漢奸麻醉人心等活動都在其列在現狀之下不用說要抵抗日人的第一步驟已嫌遲了應付他們的第二步驟亦談何容易惟有第三步驟比較還有挽回辦法而辦到了對於華北亦確有絶大的裨益但预料我方在磋商戰區未了懸案席上不至於具體的提出來就說提出來日人亦决不至於認賬就說認賬了我們亦奈何他不得。</p>
<p>然而第三步骤的險惡很毒郤不下於其他兩步骤而亦許過之因爲這是攻心的辦法借刀殺人的手段據有些人觀察日方現在並不急於以武力囊括華北而那第三步骤正以長時期［潛化默移］爲其特色所以最是可怕但只要我们能急起直追齩定牙關抱定宗旨不亢不卑再接再厲的苦幹下去未始不能加以挽救所謂苦幹的辦法以恢復民心與安定民生爲首要現在的時機雖已一天緊似一天而打消日人擴張潛伏勢力的機緣還是在我們權力範圍内的事前途的阻力亦還比較少些再遲便恐不及了。</p>
<p>新近有兩個人從華北觀察回來談起華北民氣消沉的現狀很可吃驚據說戰區一帶日人和地痞土棍相勾結固爲公開的事實不料無知人民亦竟以與日官往來爲榮耀視日人友誼爲護符而對中央政府的信仰與尊敬却遠不如東南諸省我們儘可駡其爲漢奸而漢奸一詞在他們看來决不如他方人土之嚴重又說華北研究日文日語的風氣盛極一時然其動機則绝非出於［知己知彼百戰百勝］的反抗心理而在於預謀充當亡國順民時得一較好的噉飯地少數人的觀察固不足以代表事實全般眞相但至少亦能反映日方威迫利誘的效果之一斑長此以往豈但亡國直可滅種。</p>
<p>現在乾脆說來除自認過去錯誤迅卽進行上文所指的苦幹辦法外别没靈丹妙藥政府先要給人民知道若許年的委曲求全非没相當的限度且係貫澈其最後决心之不能避免的手段再用事實證明必在可能的範圍内解除民間痛苦而政府的威信與尊嚴則有維持之必要我們不信一國人民可供異族麻醉而不能給自己人感化華北民風向稱淳厚是其長處但正以其淳厚易爲日人和漢奸所愚弄又是共短處政府要挽回華北危局請先以華北民衆爲致力的對象然後再及其他這是眞正的戰區懸案收回幾個關口添派幾名保安隊與這相比較還不是枝節問題罷了</p>

<h3>政黨不甘受蔑視　日本組閣逢暗礁　岡田與政友總裁折衝　妥恊抑决裂今日分曉</h3>
<p>（東京）岡田新内閣五日决定廣田外相之留任及大藏司法兩相、然後與政友會開始交涉、然政友會望月圭介與岡田會談一小時之結果、遂拒絶入閣、因此岡田與床次之會見、亦未能實見政友會方面在鈴木總裁宅開長老會議、又在本部開幹部會討論應付對策、仍無結果、在首相官邸等候回答之岡田首相至晚十一時半回其宿舍、順利進行之組閣工作、第二日因政黨關係暗礁發生頓、挫（六日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）政友會以鈴木總裁與岡田大將已於今日會見、當根據該項情形、訂於六日午後八時開長老與總務聯合會、又於十時起在本部舉行幹部會議、復訂於本日召開議員會議、由總裁報告經過情形、然後可正式决定態度、（六日日聯電）</p>
<h3>岡田組閣方針不容政黨占要席　超然閣不易實現</h3>
<p>（東京）岡田新内閣與政友會之關係、漸次惡化、政友會原要求内相之職、然岡田首相以澈底肅正綱紀、革正政界爲重大任務、爲達此目的、不辭解散第六十七次議會、故其態度頗强硬斷然不容政友會占内相重職、（六日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）政友會昨夜開長老總務會議、决定須探悉岡田大將之誠意後、再决定最後之態度、然大勢均表示不滿、傾向拒絶、昨夜十一時半組閣第二夜之岡田新首相、關於此事语記者曰、政友長老會議之結果、已無再考之餘地、内務之椅子求这於政黨員以外爲余組閣之根本方針、（六日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）岡田新首相之組閣方針、謂將遞信·鐵道·商工·拓務四省歸諸政黨方面、雖有如何事態發生以外各省均不愿割愛云又對於一部所傳之廢除拓務省說因現痛感海外發展之必要否認謂毫無若斯意見又稱總理之兼攝拓相說亦未加考慮云（電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）望月圭介恐絶對不前肯入閣、结果岡田新首相將與政友會絶緣、組織新閣、此時民政黨雖以黨員入閣已毫無意見、故對若槻民政總裁將取消前言、組織純粹之超然内閣、又組織閣事務、在與政友會之關係未明確以前、暫時中止、（六日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）岡田内閣書記官長河田烈、對於組閣現狀談话如下、外傳組織超然内閣、實則並無此事、内相位置之不给政黨方針亦並不變更、至阁閣員之互易與否、目下尙未决定、（六日通電）</p>
<h3>岡田與鈴木會見</h3>
<p>（東京）铃木政友會總裁於六日午後三時十五公、在組閣本部與岡田大將會見之際、當由岡田大將聲明竭力要求政友會入閣、以資援助、對置之安挿及人物之诠衡、仍請依照當初所指定、以望月氏任農林、床次氏任遞信披瀝诚意、希望鈴木總裁加以諒解、鈴木總裁則謂當諮詢黨部機關、訂於七日清晨給與相當答覆云、旋於四時五分辭歸、於是要组閣本部鼎坐恊議者僅餘岡田大將及參謀地位之後藤農相與河田拓務次官而已、三人談論之結果、認爲在铃木總裁未答覆以前、一切維持現狀、暫從缓辦、至對民政黨之正式交涉、亦須待鈴木總裁答覆後、方右着手進行、故此項組閣工作、究與政友會如何交涉、現在則處於决裂與妥恊之歧路上、全部將移至七日行使處理、（六日</p>

<h3>日新内閣　官僚化之原因　財閥棄政黨就新興勢力　起用官僚避免政軍之爭</h3>
<p>（東京）岡田新内閣之官僚化現已甚明瞭其原因如下</p>
<p>（一）西園寺元老本爲官僚之巨頭、（二）三井財閥鑑於時勢中止對政友會之投資、親近樞密院副議長平沼一派、三菱財閥亦渐减少對民政黨之投資、因其所辦軍需品工業極多、尤親近軍部、致政民均缺乏軍資金、在此數年間絶無恢復政黨政治之望、而財閥倾向新興勢力、（三）岡田内閣之命運、可謂不受政黨左右有新興官僚勢力與軍部内温健派之支持、卽能獨立安泰、（四）林陸相留任時、岡田約以實施軍部政策、故重要地位不起用政黨人、以免促起軍部與政黨之爭勢、（六日華聯電）</p>

<h3>後藤奔走任斡旋</h3>

<p>（東京）今日下午一時十五分望月圭介往訪岡田大將、會談四十分鐘、其内容係對岡田大將之勸告入閣、答以無再加考慮之餘地、拒絶入閣、於是岡田大將因打開局面計、當托代向政友會間斡旋、望月氏酌量其意、往訪鈴木總裁、詳細報告與岡田大將會見之顚、末望月氏謂、余之問題現已消滅、僅與岡田大將交換關係組閣方針之意見而、已（六日電通）</p>

<p>誰都知到，語言運動，是配合着整個文化運動，（包括政治經濟等）而來的。就整個文化運動說，目前反帝反封建的文化運動，是不是僅因爲［五四］時代的［不够］［不澈底］，而來一下［糾正］呢？顯然不是的！［五四］時代的新貴們，一方面因爲自身力量有薄弱，負不起這兩重任務，另一方面，因爲大衆文化的愈漸成長但愈使他們不安，便愈暴露他們的反動性，於是他們不僅［不澈底］，且日益向帝國主義封建勢力投降，不僅是［不够］，而且在阻礙新文化運動向前發展，試問，目前企圖［復古］者是誰？提倡［讀經尊孔］者是誰？我們總不致看不見那些五四時代的新貴吧。在目前新文化運動的任務中，台果否認了反那些新貴們，（也呌做遺老）的任務，我們還有什麽話說？我們還談些什麽反帝封建？司馬疵先生爲什麽連這一大前提也不去認識清楚？</p>
<p>假使照司馬疵先生的話，白話雖然［脫離了大部份大衆］也不要緊［牠的反動性是在牠的内容，不在牠的形式］，以至［只要看我們用甚麽内容來用這種形式］那我們目前爲什麽還要提出建設大衆语問題呢？我們又怎様去解釋，汪懋祖之［古文復興］是與整個復古運動相關聯的呢？試問，離開大衆也不要緊，還有什麽要緊呢？司馬疵先生注意内容是對的，但因注意内容而完全忽視形式，於是連所谓内容，也弄成神秘的東西，不僅否認了目前大衆語運動，連自［五四］後，整個語文運動的發展及成就，也否認了，這是多麽嚴重的錯誤，豈但輕率？</p>
<p>退一步說，即司馬疵先生要批評我們提出反白話］，是因爲怕混亂戰綫，减削自身的力量。也還是不對的，司馬疵先生僅［看到個人，而不看到整體］，見到量，而不見到質。在每一個運動中，我們最主要的，是建立整體統一的堅固陣綫，怎様建立呢？就是要注意量與質的同時發展，要吸收新的，同時要排泄腐舊的。單爲了保持質的好看，而容留許多腐舊的份子在整體内，不但不足制止陣綫混亂，且有使整體全般腐化的危險。這是［機會］意識的作崇！試問那些［五四］時代的遺老丨在那裏提倡［語錄體］，［洋八股］，以致［考古］之羣，是不是應該［反對］呢？而陳望道，夏丐尊葉聖陶諸先生，雖也是［五四］白話文運動的人物，却已走入了不衆語運動的陣營内，還能與那些遺老並論嗎？</p>
<p>以上，也许司馬疵先生看了又要以爲是［咬文嚙字］，［混亂陣綫］，其實我們絶無此意，我們以爲如要使這一大衆語運動得出正確的結論，便不能不把這一運動的意義弄清楚，我們於是便不能不再提出來一談了。</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>所以光緖和隆裕兩個人，在事實上原是姑表兄妹。雖然如此，他們中間却並無什麽眞正的愛情可言。本來，從前時候男女的婚姻問題，都是由父母代爲决定的；雙方全像瞎子一般的聽憑人家掇弄着，因此家庭間往往會有不幸的事故發生。光緖雖然貴爲一國之君，但也跳不出這種束縛，所以後來弄得他和隆裕兩個人，不但毫無情愛，簡直彼此都在怨恨着，七齒着，像仇敵一様。</p>
<p>在光緖的一生中，他所眞正愛過的女人只有一個，便是珍妃。可是珍妃當庚子年鬧拳亂的時候，已給那些太監們把伊丢在神武門東角井中去了。因爲他們覺得珍妃是宫裏一個無關緊要的人，不值得辛辛苦苦的拖着伊一起逃往西安去，便爽快的把伊端送了。（據說珍妃的屍身至今還不曾取出來，祇是在井口上加蓋一方石板而已。）當然，太監們要是不奉什麽人暗示，也决不敢這様膽大妄爲的：那末這暗示又是誰所發有呢？喏！喏！不是别人，便是吾們的太后！太后因爲光緖平日寵愛珍妃過甚，早就不歡喜伊了：待到戊戍政變鬧出來之後，又有人在太后跟前進了譫言，說珍妃就是慫恿光緒幹那一回事的主謀者，於是太后便决心要處死伊了。</p>
<p>珍妃一死，光緖的内心上所受的痛苦，自然是深切到了極點，他所僅有的幸福，僅行的快樂，從此是完全消滅了！可是他终究還是一個皇帝，又不能像平民一様的輕易自殺，輕易出走，他只獨自暗暗傷心流淚而已，珍妃還有一個同胞的姊妹，也是嫁給光緖做妃子的，喚做瑾妃。自珍妃被害之後，光緖便格外的愛惜伊了：他覺得祗有在伊那裏，還可以得到一些心靈上的慰藉。這一次隆裕和瑾妃兩個人，也是一起隨着太后上奉天去的，伊們同居在一輛車上，彼此倒還和睦：可是這兩個人在宫中都没有什麽特殊的地位，一般的祗是吃飯穿衣罷了。（七七）</p>
<h3>熱的蘇州</h3>
<p>— 含凉</p>
<p>熱浪到蘇州，報纸一說六十年來所未有，以前没有寒暑表，無從作準確的比較。但是據前輩說，光緖十八年，也是大熱，蘇州織造衙門前棋桿上的錫胡盧，竟焬成液體，滴下來的。那麽今年的熱，只以說是四十年來所未有。　蘇州的冷飲，總是全仗着西瓜的，可是西瓜上巿不久，並且量數也很少，一塊錢買四五個，滋味還不好，所以更覺得煩渴昏悶，無法可施。冰淇淋太貴族化：酸梅湯不清潔：汽水解渴的力量又薄弱。老虎灶爲了河水污濁，雇人向城外汲取，成本太大，甚至罷業，形勢的嚴重，無以復加。有人主張由各段救火會用帮浦取水，灌入城河，也有許多窒碍難行。假使老天惡作劇，再不下雨，蘇州人的喫水問題要發生恐慌了。那時疫的潛發，也在意計之中。</p>
<p>［到公園去］！自然是最時髦的口號了</p>
<p>，但是來去的行程中，足够使人熱得汗如雨下，到了那裏，人頭濟濟，熱氣也就不小。片時雖然得到一點凉快，畢竟無補於大體，所以也只意不在酒的醉翁，却很高興的走去。像懶於衣冠的我，就視爲畏途呢。</p>
<p>在這時候，還有上海的白虹隊，無錫的梁溪隊，和蘇州的健美隊，聯合舉行三角田徑賽，在一百十度的酷日下，跑，跳，眞可佩服。連看的有也有些挨不住了。但是享慣電風冰飲的吳似蘭君，與他的夫人姚韵梅女士，也揮汗而來，主持會務和給獎，都有抗熱的精神。</p>
<p>［請銅觀音！］也是蘇州人的［看家拳，］但是请來了幾天，依然不雨。可惜錢篤笤不能復生，否則再來一個庇妙觀求雨，倒是很好玩的。但是斷屠齋戒設壇祈禱的把戲，不久還得出演，也未可知。本來這個年頭，一方面掮出科學的旗幟來，天變不足畏；一方面還是捧着科學靈乩和宗敎督學的招牌來，靠天喫飯，社會永永是如此地矛盾着。</p>
<h3>祈雨談</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>雨暘以時，收功田疇。若久旱龜坼，乃有祈雨之舉行。葩經云；［以祈甘雨］，可見祈雨由來甚古。舊例裨雨必先由民牧出示禁屠，意謂下界殺生太甚，以致上干天怒，禁屠所以贖愆，三日不雨至五日，五日不雨至七日，　　　　　　東北四連長張　木著</p>
<h3>第三十一回三次交鋒白衣衝雪陣全營殉國赤眼入槍林</h3>
<p>在稭秫上躺有四個人，緊鄰着自己的，就是上士王士立。他正哼着呢。看到自强，帶了慘淡的微笑，抬起一隻手來，指了一指脅下。自强看時，掛了彩啦，紫色的斑，將衣服印透，或了疙疤了。便道；老王，你··他依然微笑，那手垂下，搭在了胸前，按在口袋上，口袋裏露出日記本子呢。自强道；兄弟，你放心，我給你家捎信去。他眼睛呆了，慢慢的收歛了笑容，他爲國犠牲了，盡了他軍人的責任。自强猛然的醒過來，就遇到了這一件事，他心裏有些明白。分明是王士立咬住牙關，等着自己說兩名話呢，定了定神，他細揣測了全身一下，覺得並没有那一處感着特别痛苦，也許身上不曾受傷，這倒是可慶幸的事。至於自己昏昏的躺下，大概是摔傷了。於是兩手按住了稭秫，慢慢的撑起身子，這才感到頭上有些沉沉的，還不能抬起，只好忍耐着，又睡下了。過了一會，實營長來了。他雖是打了一夜的仗，軍服穿得整整的，帽子戴得端端的，臉上乾乾凈凈，兩隻顴骨泛出淺紅色來。他一進來，看到自强醒了，便笑道；趙連長，你好了，没事，不過你疲勞過分罷了。自强道；多謝營長來看我，王士立，他去了，剛才去的寳芳對了王士立看看，手上拿了帽子，不覺垂下頭去。但是這也不過兩分鐘的工夫，兩分鐘以後，寳芳立刻興奮起來了，向自强道；我想我們有援兵，今天下午可以到了，昨天晚上，小鬼吃了我們有虧不小，你歇着罷。寳芳說畢，去了，一會功夫，來了兩名弟兄，要抬王士立走，自强道；他口袋裏，也許有家信呢，你們搜一搜。（四二八）</p>
<p>必雨降而始開屠。雖老饕者引以爲苦，然榖食攸關，不敢誹背谪也。</p>
<p>姑蘇光福鄕有銅觀音殿，所供觀音，頗著靈異。凡旱魃成災，官民備儀仗軒輿，至香雪海迎之。謂銅觀音一至雨師必隨之而來，旣霑旣足，潤禾濡蔬，田氓額手稱慶以爲常。數日後仍以隆崇之禮送之返駕。相傳某次接銅觀音以祈雨，雲霓遂願，爲求省事寗人起見，乃將銅觀音交航船帶信人送還，不料此後繼續大旱，官民以爲簡慢之餘，有動觀音厥氣也，拈香叩禱，一再始已。從此不敢再蹈厚迎薄送之覆辙。神話如此，亦足資談助也。猶憶某歲迎銅觀音於滄浪亭之明道堂，予曾一度往瞻，觀音爲铜質，高祗二三尺，身披素色氅，端坐玻璃龕中，且以金花點綴之，兩旁有銜牌，如瑞光普照沛澤流慈等，蓋皆出於前清御賜者也。一般愚夫婦紛往膜拜，</p>
<p>香烟氤氲，終日不散，堂左爲五百名賢祠，庭院中植竹成叢，愚夫婦乃摘枝葉以歸，謂神庇之物，可以療治宿疾，不旬日賢祠之竹爲之盡，更剝白皮松而代之，松亦萎悴欲死，成爲一時笑話。今夏亦久旱不雨，在此祈雨聲中，記此以博讀者一粲。</p>

<h3>『嚴陵釣壇應在富春山及其他的反證和書後（下）</h3>
<p>— 陳師誠</p>
<p>古人講地理，大都是閉門造車，不是實地去調查的。一统志之下此斷語，或即誤於集覧及新安志二書的記載集覧係元王幼學年撰。他對富春山的注釋是；［新安志云，漢富春縣西有富春山，後避晋簡文鄭太后諱，改曰富陽。案嚴光傅耕於富春山，圖經不載此山；但云今名嚴陵山者，是其所钓處。（石印本作耕處。孰是孰非，無從查考；附誌以質高明。）却載嚴光富陽人，耕於富春山。沈約宋書；吳時分富春縣地置桐廬縣；則嚴陵山即富春山無疑。］細玩這叚文字的辭意是；他爲了圖經不載富春山，無從查考其所在，因此連想到桐廬在漢代是富春縣的一部份，嚴陵山又在桐廬南四十里的七里　；所以就下了富春山即嚴陵山的斷語。然而這也不過是一種猜度臆測之辭，根本上就没有有力的證據。玩［但云］［却載］四字，就可見其不自覺的流露出心中不安的神氣來！王幼學假使能够澈底了解嚴光傅的註語。我想他决不會下這似是而百有斷語。（讀上文自知。非敢武斷。明陳濟著集覧正誤；可見集覧的考據不，盡可靠。）集覧旣一誤於前，一統志因之再誤於後，甚至馮智舒著質實再引一統志來作富春山在桐廬縣的證據；可以說是三誤了。</p>
<p>根據後漢書及其註語所得的意見是；我們在歷史上地理上隨時可見山名地名合一的郡縣，如中牟，天台等類。圖經上旣不載富春山的名目，可見嚴光傳所說的富春山，並不是指定一個固定的山峰；不過是說光耕於富春而已。註中不說［在今杭州富陽縣境］而說［今杭州富陽縣也］，也是這個意思。如果他所指的是一個固定的山峯，圖經上怎會不載它的名目呢？所以火君要考證那一個山峯是富春山，也许和他斷定那一塊大石是釣磯一般的都是節外生枝。（［赭黑大石］四字上火君現又加了［大羣］兩字，可謂善於補過。）</p>
<p>火君又引陸游嚴州釣台買田記來證明耕釣在於一處；引謝　登西台慟哭記來證明釣台在富春山。細讀火君提出的慟哭記原文，始终不曾見有富春山三字，不知他怎様可以證明築台的山呌富春山？買田記台能細心去讀，一定可以知道此記不特不足以證明耕釣在於一處，而且還是他的反證。買田記云；［讀唐興元中崔儒釣台記，以爲上有平田百畝，足以力耕，下臨清流，足以垂釣；今投釣之地具在，而田則亡有··］。假使山上果有嚴光耕過的田，放翁只能說它已荒蕪不堪耕種，决不敢說它是亡有的。細繹放翁之意，明明是說他上了崔儒的當，以爲上有平田百畝，及至身歷其境，才知道山上並没有嚴先生所耕的田；辭意甚明，火君抑何不思之甚？</p>
<p>我素抱［知之爲知之不知爲不知］的宗旨。遇到未有可靠證據時，就用［或者］［也許］等字來表示我有見解，不敢，也不屑借重盲目的引證，作武斷語，致爲識者齒冷。學無止境，我所見到的書，不過如滄海中之一粟；根本上就够不上考據學者的資格。也不敢自以爲是而痛詆他人，致自損人格。火君所賜的頭銜，不敢領受。</p>
<p>編者按；關於］嚴陵釣壇］之論辯，已一再刋登，孰是孰非，殊難判斷，安得起子陵於地下而問之？本刋篇幅有限，積稿過多，雙方論辯，即此而止。以後恕不付刋。</p>

<h3>選擇性問題</h3>
<p>— 江之蕃</p>
<p>甲綫路討論</p>
<p>滬上電台林立，週率之差，極爲擠近。同時發射電力，均屬中下二等。在如此惡劣之收音環境中，欲分隔清楚，輸出强大。實非易易，一般業餘家殆爲束手無策，深感苦痛之事實。　　就選擇性優越言，當以超等外差綫路爲最，然而此種綫路。頗不易自製，且非有高等測騐器不可。而高等測騐器之價值，往往較收音機本身之價值昂貴不少。卽超等外差綫路，每需四五個眞空管以上，尤不合一般業餘家之經濟條件。更進一步言，超等外差綫路輸出効率頗低，殊不合算。</p>
<p>若加多射電週率放大級，亦不經濟，且選擇性亦未必優越。調節復極困難。况射電週率放大，用於一般綫路，不得超出二三級以上，否則檢波級將負荷過度，而致損壞。事實上，射電週率放大，於靈敏度功効實大。於選擇性，雖能利用其濾波作用，而成績殊爲有限。　　經濟化之七埠收音，似用一級四極管再生式强力檢波，及一級五極管强力放大，或二級三極管成音週率放大，爲最合理之綫路。至於江浙一帶收音，則再加一級四極管射電週率放大卽足。唯此種綫路之最大缺點，卽爲分隔不清。一般比較經濟的增加選擇性方法，可分爲數種：</p>
<p>（一）前置選擇器</p>
<p>（二）環狀天綫</p>
<p>（三）公綫鑰制</p>
<p>（一）前置選擇器其作用卽爲一濾波器，置於天綫與收音機之間。選擇性是否優越，全恃前置選擇器設計之優劣，但調節頗繁，工作不甚可靠。比較合用之綫路，請參閱中國無綫電一卷十期第四五頁［四用選擇器之裝置一文］。</p>
<p>（二）環狀天綫，利用環狀天綫之定向性質，以代配諧綫圈，選擇性固可增高，但訊號强度爲之减低，故亦非美善之方法。（待續）</p>
<h3>收音機唱機接續器</h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>收音機除接收無綫電廣播音樂外，如加接一拾音器，亦可兼唱留聲機片，今之收音機備有拾音器者，都接在檢波极　路内，如超外差式機，則在第二檢波級的輸入綫路内，但此種接法，實有三大缺點；第一收音機内起作用的，僅有成音週率放大一小部份，其餘如高週率放大級中間週率級以及振盪級等，完全不生效力，故不特大部份電力消耗於無用。且有損眞空管壽命，不經濟殊甚。第二因僅能利用成音週率放大一小部份，效力極微，除少數備有强力成音週率放大的高貴收音機，尙能啟動揚聲器外，其餘稍次的收音機，卽不能應用。第三添接拾音器插頭，檢波級内引綫勢必加長，以致往往起不需要的振盪，使收音機發生意外的障碍。</p>
<p>本篇所述的接續器，完全爲免除上述三點困難而设計，其基本原理無異於一小型播音機，綫路極簡單，以４３號高週率五極管作振盪管，振盪週率應配在廣播週率範圍以内，綫圈Ｓ可以二十八號綫在二吋半直徑的膠管上繞一百圈，在五十圈處出一中心接頭。以接至高壓正極，Ｐ可以卅二號綫隔一層絶緣紙繞在Ｓ上二十五圈，此綫圈須以金屬罩隔離，Ｓ與１組成高週率綫路，一端連接眞空管屏極，一端連接　　極，電源供給可直接取自一百十弗打交流電，無需電源變壓器，以新式２５Ｚ５作整流管，兩眞空管的絲極應串聯後，再接iioY40W的電燈砲．</p>
<p>應用此器時，先以Ｐ兩端直接連至廣播收音機天地綫接頭上，再中以一綫使控制　與陰極相連，如Ｘ處虚綫所地，此時調整收音機，可在一點上聽得尖銳的呌聲，表示此接續器已產生振盪，然後除去此綫，以唱機上的拾音器（卽電唱頭）接續器輸出的高週率振盪電能，卽依拾音器的成音週率而起調幅作用，故此時收音機内卽可聞得唱片的音樂聲，接續器輸出的赒週率可轉動Ｃ１隨意變更，最好應擇收音機刻度盤上較岑寂的一段，以免與其他電台相干擾．</p>
<h3>礦石的製成</h3>
<p>— 靑霞</p>
<p>我們玩無綫電的人，什麽東西都希望自己能做，雖然成績不十分好也是願意有，礦石機是初學者最先認識的好友，所以我就把礦石的製成公開底告訴讀者，以便讀者自製，現在巿上充滿着仇貨ＡＭ牌固定礦石，及活動礦石，難道我們願意將錢去交換仇貨嗎？還是讓我們來自製，多得受店家的欺騙，改頭換目的將仇貨來交換我們的金錢，稍爲有一些公學常識的人，都能說出礦石的化學成份，普通所用的礦石是硫化鋁（ＰＢＳ），ＡＭ牌也是這一種，要做這種礦石也不難，只要到西藥房去買一些硫磺（Ｓulphur)，一磅大约祇需四角，另外再去買一些比較純粹的鋁，（切不可以鋁字之鋁代之因鋁字之鋁是鋅錫鋁等之合金）把牠們并合就成了，但是這兩種東西須使之化合才能成礦石，並不是祇把兩様混合，要做成礦石，須使硫及鋁眞正化學上的化合，並非普通的混合，現在先把買來的鋁，（如原塊的）剪成碎塊，然後和以適量之硫礦，不右太少，稍多倒無妨，和後包入薄紙内，另外拿爛泥一塊，（最好用磁泥工業原料公司有售色淡黃形如磚須磨細和水）揑成球形，把這紙包放入泥團之中，使之陰乾，然後把牠放在烈火之中，時間愈長愈好，（作者做時係放在煤爐中約一日）使其確實在化合，拿出來把泥團打碎，就得有光亮黑色之結晶體，如果不光亮而成細粒狀者，就是證明尙未完全化合，所以切不可操之過急，以免失敗，雖然這種未曾完全化合的礦石，也可以檢波，但靈敏點較少，而且容易碎。</p>
<h3>鐸接的簡法</h3>
<p>— 芳華</p>
<p>銲接電綫在製作收音機和裝置收音機是一件重的事情，許多連接的地方不加鐸接，不久便發生了不良的影響：可是銲接的手續却很麻煩，置備一大堆工具和材料：下面的方法却是很簡單，先把電綫的兩端磨探清潔了，略糿幾轉，然後把包香烟等用的錫紙包上幾層，（裏面加些松香）把包地方放在酒精燈上燒等到溶化了，自然　在一塊了。</p>
<h3>焊劑造法</h3>
<p>— 郭永年</p>
<p>普通焊接金屬有焊劑（俗稱焊藥·），都是酸性的混合物，拿來作爲焊接無綫電機件戒接頭之用，不久之後，酸質就將所焊接的地方漸漸腐蝕起來而增加了電阻，可是考究有都買配就的無酸性焊劑，實在無酸性焊劑製法很簡便，所費也不出四角錢，只要向中國藥材店買一大塊松香，把牠拷碎了溶在森精（ＭothylatedSpirit)裏卽成，要精在西藥房及化學儀器店有售，只須一小酒杯的分量就够，製成的焊劆和普通的一様使用，但所要焊接的銅絲機件，須特别擦得光亮清潔。</p>

<p>不是住在新式平屋面屋子的人們，要裝一具天綫，是時常會感到困難和討壓的，因爲在瓦面上爬牆挖壁，總覺得有黸危險。那麽利用室内電燈電源綫來做天綫，就是一個很好的方法。不過電綫用作天綫，不是時常都響亮的，每收一個電台的播音，就必須用一個不同容量的電容器才行。譬如某一無綫電臺用○○○二五兆分，法拉特的電容器就可以收聽的很滿意，但是别一些就要用到○○三和　　四兆分法拉特了。</p>
<p>下面一具是利用七個電容器而變做十二種接合的。綫路和零件如下：</p>
<p>Ｌ爲繞六十圈插入内式的普通蜂房式綫圈（亦可用别種替代）。Ｃ爲○○○五兆分法拉特變量電容器。Ｃ１至８俱爲固定電容器：Ｃ１○○○一五淣分法拉特</p>
<p>Ｃ２○○二五</p>
<p>Ｃ３○○○五·Ｃ４○○一·</p>
<p>Ｃ５○○二·Ｃ６○○三·</p>
<p>Ｃ７○○四·Ｃ８○○二·</p>
<p>Ｄ礦石·</p>
<p>Ｓ爲分綫鑰，但必須用一膠木鈕，以免調節這些電容器太快時發生危險。那分綫鑰要大些，使可以同時接觸兩根分綫釘，這麽有時就可將兩個電容器的容量連接在一起。譬如把分綫鑰騎接在Ｃ１和Ｃ２上那麽就可得○○○四的容量的了。</p>
<p>騎接在Ｃ６和Ｃ７上，就可得○○七了。這様用七個電容器，便可變做十二種不同的聯接。</p>
<p>使用法也很容易：先把分綫鑰接在Ｃ４上，然後轉動Ｃ來找你要收聽的電臺，待找到後，便去轉動那分綫鑰，或單接，或騎接在那些分綫上，直至最響度爲止，在調節時，也得輕輕的再把Ｃ轉動一下。</p>
<h3>礦石能檢波之理由</h3>
<p>— ＲＦ</p>
<p>礦石之整流作用，據輓近物理學家研究之結果，認爲乃一種熱電電壓之故（ThermohhllelcuicelectromotiyeForce）因觸針與礦石面上相觸之處，產生熱電電壓。而此熱電電壓，與外來電訊電壓之正負二方，發生相反之影響。故能現出整流作用。</p>
<h3>一個奇特的揚聲器</h3>
<p>— 凡言</p>
<p>有一次作者替友人裝一架直流四管機，該機具有一級高週率放大，一级回授式檢波，二級成音低週率放大，裝就試騐的效果，覺得音量和靈後度不十分美滿，而且還帶有沙聲，偶然發覺揚聲器並没有接上，那末這聲音是從何而發出來的呢？後來詳細底聽辨發覺該聲音是從第二級低週率放大變壓器上發出來的，這一來，眞使我啞然失笑！原來该變聲器外面有兩片金屬壳，壳上羅絲没有旋緊的緣故，當低週成音電流由該變壓器初級通過時，砂鋼片便發生磁塲，外壳的金屬皮便作爲發音的振動板，音量的高低，皆隨眞空管屏極間輸出電流的强弱，後來將該金屬皮上羅絲旋緊，這聲音就没有了，考察這作用原理不外一架小形揚聲器。</p>

<h3>丨接線法</h3>
<p>— 曼萍</p>
<p>用那很細銅綫所繞成的綫圈；如變壓器，擴聲機，阻流圈，及聽筒，當斷綫了時，再要重新拆開繞綫，在没有任何機械可以帮助的靑年業餘家，是一件很困難的事，結果非重新購買，即須送到修理店去重新換上綫圈。總而言之，這是一筆意外的損失。我們在實騐室，亦時常的不留心燒斷綫圈。但是用了下面所述的方法，十之八九可以挽救已斷綫实的效用。　　利用高壓的電源，接在已斷綫的綫圈的兩端，因爲斷綫的兩個綫頭距離很近，所以在兩個斷綫的綫頭上，發生的火花及高熱，足以鎔接道已斷的綫頭，發生高壓的裝置，有的利用感應圈，（lnductionCoil)或利用收音機的Ｂ電壓，（須在300Vfoov）但電燈有電源，恐怕電流過大，不能利用。</p>
<p>現在就以普通收音機的電源變壓器來做我們的工具，Ｘ爲Ｂ電壓的　板，Ｙ爲變流後的陰愓極，（如圖）修理時可將已斷綫圈的兩端，接在Ｘ或Ｙ的兩端，Ｘ的電壓比較Ｙ來得高，接續時可先用Ｙ，如不能鎔接則用Ｘ的電源（普通多用Ｙ作修理變壓器或阻流圈，Ｘ則作修理擴聲機）斷綫綫圈與ＸＹ的兩極，不能接續太久，因接續後，常會使别的部分斷綫所以在斷綫綫圈與高奛電源的電路中，須插入電鍵（Ｋey）作此工作時，须將收音機全體的眞空管拔去，如用Ｙ時須留下整流管。</p>
<p>如一次未接得滿意，可以反復數次的接續，Ｘ的電壓極高，處理時須加以十分注意。</p>

<h3>自由談再論重譯</h3>
<p>— 史</p>
<p>看到穆木天先生的［論重譯及其他］下篇的末尾，才知道是在釋我的誤會。我却覺得並無什麽誤會，不同之黠，只在倒過了一個輕重，我主張首先要看成績的好壤，而不管譯文是直接或間接，以及譯者是怎様的動機。</p>
<p>木天先生要譯者［自知］，用自己的長處，譯成［一勞永逸］的書。要不然，還是不動手的好。這就是說，與其來種荊棘，不如留下一片白地，讓别的好園丁來種可以永久觀賞的佳花。但是，［一勞永逸］的话，有是有的，而［一勞永逸］的事却極少，就文字而論，中國的這方塊字便决非［一勞永逸］的符號。况且白地也决不能永久的保留，旣有空地，便會生長荊棘或　麥。最要緊的是有人來處理，或者培植，或去删除，使翻譯界略免於蕪雜。這就是批評。</p>
<p>然而我們向來看輕着翻譯，尤其是重譯。對於創作，批評家是總算時時開口的，一到翻譯，則前幾年還偶有專指誤譯的文章，近來就極其少見：對於重譯的更其少。但在工作上，批評翻譯却比批評創作難，不但看原文須有譯者以上的工力，對作品也須有譯者以上的理解。如木天先生所說，重譯有數種譯本作參考，這在譯者是極爲便利的，因爲甲譯本可疑時，能够參看乙譯本。直接譯就不然了，一有不懂的地方，便無法可想，因爲世書之多，這也許是一種原因，說偷懶也行，但大約也還是語學的力是不足的緣故。遇到這種參酌各本而成的譯本，批评就更爲難了，只少也得能看各種原譯本。如陳源譯的［父與子］，魯迅譯的［毁滅］，就都屬於這一類的。</p>
<p>我以爲翻譯的路要放寛，批評的工作要着重。倘只是立論極嚴，想使譯者自己愼重，倒會得到相反的結果，要好的愼重了，亂譯者却還是亂譯，這時惡譯本就會比稍好的譯本多。</p>
<p>臨末還有幾句不大緊要的话。木天先生因爲懹疑重譯，見了德譯本之後，連他自己所譯的［塔什干］，也定爲法文原譯是删節本了。其實是不然的。德譯本雖然厚，但那是兩部小說合訂在一起的，後面的大半，就是緩拉菲摩維支的［鐵流］。所以我們所有的漢譯［塔什干］，也並不是節本。</p>
<h3>旅仰散記</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>旅仰之日，晚間没地方可玩耍，而又覺到很寂寞的時候，就一個人登上貨車到鄰近的縣城或鄕鎭去，約莫玩到半夜之際，便又搭車回來。丨這是我的嗜好，像别人的喜歡烟喜歡酒一様。</p>
<p>如此的旅行，在月夜固然是很好；睜着倦怠的眼睛，憑窗望去，田野，茅屋，椰林··都酣睡在月光下面，徐徐地移向尾後，一種寗靜的氛圍，便和掠過車窗的凉風，泥土靑草的氣息，一同地襲人胸懹。然而，即使當着黑夜，也仍舊不錯，像車路旁邊遠遠近近的人家，一瞥地現出燈火，就彷彿一些凄美的眼珠，在濃黑的髮下，暗自窺人一様。總之，這一來，整天在事務上弄呆板了的心情，便得突然爲之鬆爽活潑了。</p>
<p>旅行是精神的沐浴呵！</p>
<p>我所常到的地方，應該說是鄰近仰光的永勝縣吧。這是像一般的小縣城一様，缅式的木造屋宇，洋式的水泥建築，多是疎疎落落地點綴着，中間夾雜普草地和樹蔭，那風味，可以說是極其清新的。本地的男女，坐在屋前的木階上納凉，從掛着珠　的窗間，透出燈光的綫條，便　在他們的頭上。間或有人在寂寞地拉葫蘆琴子，奏出一種略帶感傷的哀調。但當幾人合唱着歌時，便顯得分外快樂了，那之間，且可以聽見拍乎調節歌曲的聲音。</p>
<p>在那裏有廣不人的洋貨店和飯店，雲南回敎徒的　店，印度人和福建福州人的茶店，獨獨没有缅甸人開設的舖子。這並不是缅甸人不願做生意，甘</p>
<h3>不可知的人</h3>
<p>（波特萊爾散文詩）</p>
<p>— 藴文譯</p>
<p>誰是你所最愛的，謎様的人啊，你說？是你的父親，你的母親，你的姊妹，或者你的兄弟？</p>
<p>我是没有父親，也没有母親，没有姊妹，也　没有兄弟。</p>
<p>你的朋友？</p>
<p>你這次所說的這個名詞，我至今還不懂它是什麽意思。</p>
<p>你的祖國。</p>
<p>我不知它在那個高位。</p>
<p>美色？</p>
<p>我也許會願意愛它，假使是絶色而不朽的女神。</p>
<p>黃金？</p>
<p>我恨它，像你恨上帝那様地。</p>
<p>啊！那麽你到底愛什麽呢，不可思議的人呵！</p>
<p>我愛那雲···那浮動着的雲···在那邊那不可思議的雲！</p>
<h3>休息</h3>
<p>ＴＫ</p>
<p>心讓外族人賺錢，而是他們一向就缺少着做生意的技術和商業資本的原故。丨差不多一般的南洋土人都是如此的。倘若說商業資本的勢力，是必然要征服農民的話，那末，中國人之所以能南洋發財，乃是極其自然的事情。同時也就因爲只進步到商業資本這一階段，所以不論中國人在南洋是如何有勢力，也僅能穩坐在［買辦］這一把交椅上面罷了。</p>
<p>坐在店前的露天茶桌上，一面飲啜着咖啡，吹着凉風，一面思索着這類的事情，是很有味的。</p>
<h3>小星與東方未明</h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>提起［小星］兩字，人家就會以爲說的姨太太。原來這典故出在詩經。毛詩召南小星篇小序道：</p>
<p>小星，惠及下也。夫人無妬忌之行，惠及賤妾，進御於君，知其命有貴賤，能盡其心矣。</p>
<p>這是漢學家對於小星篇的一個解釋。宋學家也不曾跳過漢學家這條詩說的範圍，所以朱子詩經集傳裏說：</p>
<p>南國夫人承后妃之化，能不妬忌以惠其下，故其衆妾美之如此。</p>
<p>新的國學家胡適之先生却很大膽地别創一個新解。他在談談詩經一文裏說：</p>
<p>［嘒彼小星］一詩是寫妓女生活的最古記載。我們試看老殘遊記，可見黃河流域的妓女送鋪蓋上店陪客人的情形。再看原文：　嘒彼小星，維參與昴。肅宵征！</p>
<p>我們看她抱衾裯以宵征，就可知道她爲的何事了。</p>
<p>胡先生這一說，自然新頴可喜。不過原文［夙夜在公］一語作何解釋？似乎他没有想到。難道當時的妓女要不論日夜的爲公家當差，支配階級還要揩賣淫女子的油麽？</p>
<p>如今我也有一個解釋：</p>
<p>這篇詩是寫當時人民爲公家行役當差的生活，或者是寫低級的公務人員的生活。試譯如下：</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>那微光的小星，有三五個在東。嚴肅的黑夜也得出行，不論早和晚都要在公。實在是命運和人不同！（二）</p>
<p>那微光的小星，有兩個呌參昴。嚴肅的黑夜也得出行，連被頭帳子一起都抱。實在是命運不比人好！</p>
<p>在詩經裏面和這個同一性質的詩，還有齊風東方未明一篇。不過前一篇係說夜裏不得休息，後一篇係說起身太早。大約官愈大愈没事，官愈小愈勞苦，衙門小職員更不容易做，尤其是行役當差的小百姓，古今相差不甚遠的。現在我把這篇詩的原文寫出對照，試譯如下：</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>東方没有發光，顚倒穿上衣裳。管牠顚顚倒倒，公家呌我趕早！（二）</p>
<p>東方没有亮起，顚倒穿上裳衣。管牠倒倒顚顚，公家有令難延！（三）</p>
<p>折下柳枝圍著茶圃，糊塗人不守這秩序。不能分别日夜早晚，不早就晚他也不願！據毛詩小序說：［東方不明，刺無節也。朝廷與居無節，號令不時，挈壼氏不能掌其職焉。］這個解釋大致是對的。朱子集傳也採這一說。可是我不懂小星那篇正和這篇詩同一性質，何以詩序獨釋爲夫人惠及賤妾之詩？只因前人有這麽一個誤解，於是後人就大家公認［小星］爲姨太太一個代詞了。</p>
<h3>騙子們</h3>
<p>— 草明</p>
<p>一次跑到廣州，找着我底隔别了兩年的乾媽。她更變得和善，親切了，因爲她那當了七年警察的兒子丨丨富生，剛升做警長不久，所以她鼻子下加了兩道淺淺的欣悅的皺紋。</p>
<p>第二次再到她家裏的時候，就碰到了那承襲了母親底慈和的性子的富哥。他雖然是一個三十多歲的男人，可是常常做出孩子似地天眞的舉動。他那雙緩慢地睞着眼睛，透露出一種給極大的矛盾縛束着的苦惱。聽他講話，就會想到他那軟弱的性情跟他底野蠻的職業揉在一起，是一件怎様滑稽的事。</p>
<p>［啊，怪道兄弟們說：［土綾魚］都從順德跳到廣州來了！］一見我，他就帶着一種經過磨練的熱情，粗魯而詼諧地說。</p>
<p>［老老實實說句眞話呀！你可以介紹一份小工給我麽？隨便什麽都不論····］我對他提出了我底要求。</p>
<p>［一點也没有開玩笑呢！］他變得莊重點了，［每天晚上從長堤那些旅館裏拉出來的那二三個裏頭，順德女人至少佔十幾個。］</p>
<p>他沉默了好一會兒，嚥着自己的唾沫，様子好像喉嚨裏有一　枚小瘡。往後便滔滔地講下去，告訴我下面那様的故事。</p>
<p>［廣州是多麽廣大，多麽高貴呀，好像廣州是一個大的裝滿蜜　糖葉的金漆盒子。那匹餓貓不想鑽進去看個究竟？原來這様，裏面凈是些拉不到男人，呆站在路邊，或是在旅館給你們抓了去的女人，在人力車館，機器縫衣店，織造廠門外，流着口水望着，一點生意也没有的女有···外面的確塗了金哩，騙人的空盒子！···］</p>
<p>字的，她們難道想把責任推到我們身上，來掩飾自己的犯法行爲麽？丨丨警察像一架四面都裝上了鏡頭的攝影機，社會上所有的東西都映進牠裏頭···你說吧，世間上那一様壤事我没有乍見過？可是，我怎様地被一套衣服限制着呀！是的，我應該咒祖我底制服！有一次晚上一點鐘左右，我跟弟兄們去搜查一家三等旅館，碰着一個眼角有個疤痕的大眼姑娘，又是我們底同鄕哩。這眞是氣人丨丨丨那當兒，那個瘦弱的主顧皺着眉頭扔了兩張五元鈔票出來，給我一張，她一張，就穿起長衫走了。鴿子籠様的房間剩下我和那個只穿了一套底衫褲的大眼女人。</p>
<p>［還不趕快滚蛋！］我恐怕弟兄就要進來，着急地對她說了。她没有理我，把身子躺得直直地，疲倦地對我說：</p>
<p>［我没有好好地睡過呢·····可是，你那五塊錢給了我吧？我陪你再睡一會兒。］</p>
<p>［喂，你記得我是什麽人麽，這件事惠方便了大家的呀，現在，我不理你，你倒撒起野來了！帶你上警區再說好不好？］</p>
<p>［隨便你呀，只要你替我把那五塊錢寄給我母親。她老人家來信，說她跟妹妹已經兩天没有東西吃了···我求你讓我陪陪你，把那鈔票给我，難道這也算犯罪不成？你家裏母親跟妹妹斷不至於捱餓的。老婆討過了没有？當眞没有？···］她誓不干休地跟我說一大套話。硬把我那隻握着鈔票的手牽着。我望望自己身上發光的銅鈕和肩章，我記起一句俗話來了丨丨慈悲是蹲在法律脚底下的。</p>

<h3>大衆語一中國底重要性</h3>
<p>— 寒白</p>
<p>在大衆語爭論的現階段，依然還有許多參戰者，帶着懹疑的態度，去估計大衆語的存在和價值；更有人樹着復興文言文的大旗，來和大衆語相抗爭。不消說，還有許多傍觀者，陷在撲索迷離的萬花洞中哩！因之，我就確定這様一個題目丨丨大衆語在中國的重要性。</p>
<p>要解决這具有重大意義的問題，首先我們必須要去探求產生大衆語本身的動力。因爲大衆語不是像封神榜上或西遊記上的神語，而是等於没有没有父母的兒子。所以要確定大衆語在中國的重要性，那必得要瞭解中國產生大衆語的社會條件，否則，是無異於緣木求魚，徒勞無功的。</p>
<p>中國目前的社會，就經濟言，則民族資本不能抵抗帝國主義商品的侵入，因之就震撼了數千年來自給自足的經濟機構，農村陷於極端的恐慌中。就政治言，則自雅片戰爭，紙老虎被人截穿後，因經濟發展畸形的關係，完全是一個指揮刀统治的歷程。就民衆的生活言，則沉淪於帝國主義壓迫和封建剝削的鐵鞭之下呻吟着。由此可以知道，中國是在一個急劇轉變的時代。然而在此急劇轉變的過程中，是需要動員無數千萬的被壓迫大衆到戰綫上去的，但爲要怎様使這些戰士們，澈底瞭解他們赋于的任務，那非得在政治上去訓練他們不可。這様，大衆語可以說是成爲一種政治訓練的有力的工具了。</p>
<p>大衆語所以在中國的重要性，因爲它能負起下面的幾種使命；</p>
<p>一，反對帝國主義文化的侵略帝國主義在中國除了政治與經濟的统治以外，文化的侵略他們是始終没有放鬆過的。祗要看一看民衆的娛樂品，就不難知道，像說書，演義，小唱，草台班··當中，由都巿至於窮鄕僻壤，都參雜着由靑年會，基督敎，聖道院，禮拜堂，修道院，敎會學校··，所散佈的博愛，和平，無抵抗底思想的麻醉，帝國主義適應他們在中國的政治經濟的統治，採取這些文化的侵略方式，來實行對於中國大衆的奴化敎育。負着那博愛衆生的十字架遠征力的牧師，神父，傳道者，深入到工廠，工人區，滲入農村以至於蠻苗部落，去建造抵抗新文化的堡壘，麻醉意識落後的大衆，這是鐵一般的事實啊！所以富有優良性的大衆語，就是掃除帝國主義文化侵略的工具。　　二，肅清封建文化的遺毒，在中國目前所流生的一種言語方式，到處都充滿着封建意識的成份，特别是一般高等華人以及清室遺老們，他們的一言一行，都十足代表着孔孟的學說與思想，正義道德的敎條，下層了衆的言語，在他們聽起來，認爲是非常鄙夷的。不消說，言语同様是有階級性的，代表少數人們利益底階級，當然是想用盡方法，去向意識落後的人們說敎。於是一般勸勞大衆，對於生活的意識，對於社會現象的觀察，總之他們的人生觀與宇宙觀，直接間接地受着這種說敎的影響，這是多麽一種危險的病徵啊！大衆語就是運用最大多數的利益，來肅清這種開倒車的言語的工具。</p>
<p>三，便利訓練意識落後的大衆，中國的文盲，密佈着各處，大約有百分之八九的人民，是等於没的眼睛的。因之要使這般未來的主人，能得到普遍智識的慾求，大衆語是一種最良好而便利的工具，它能以最少的時間，得到最大的效果。</p>
<p>大衆語在中國是成爲必人的糧食了，不過，瓿題是怎様來使它推動，發展下去。</p>
<h3>舊式婚姻戒嚴運動</h3>
<p>— 烔女士</p>
<p>讀了婦女園地二十期關於碧遙君提出的丨丨舊式婚姻戒嚴運動丨丨的這個口號之後，心裏感到莫名的奮然！在這様半身不遂的時代裏，殘餘的封建意識，還没有達到根本破壤而尙深根蒂固的長在這黑暗的社會的現在，確實有被提出的必要，尤其是在一般女同胞們，是值得關心的一回事啊！</p>
<p>最近福建　安北門外的九女因婚姻不滿，投水自殺，和杭州行素女校學生史濟華女士，以未婚夫不通文墨，而也投井自殺的事，是我們稍事關心社會問題和婦女問題的人，决不可緘默的了！　　在這畸形的社會組織之下，一直到現在，婦女們的生活，還是没有走上人的生活之途，雖然，婦女解放的空頭口號，已經高唱入雲霄，但實際上是没有解救被壓在地獄裏面的女同胞們的眞實痛苦於萬一，莫不是嗎？在報端上我們常常看見的什麽［某女因婚姻不滿意而厭世啦］，［某女因愛情　烈而自盡］的</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>悲慘消息丨丨我們當起着如何的作用？至少，在這新舊交替的時代，一切的新的組織，還没有展開在我們的眼前，而舊的制度，亦尙未達到根本破壤的現在，我們究竟爲怎様呢？親愛的女同胞們，一切還須待我們自己來冷靜的，理智的去處置；我們首先就應該知道，在這洪濤奔浪的時代裏，只有我們拿出自己所有的力量來，推翻舊有的制度，而再用自己的力是，創造新的途程，是我們唯一的責任，不必推委，不怕艱難的應該自己起來在這裏找光明！</p>
<p>我們要從歷史的事實研究婚姻制度的沿革，顯然的我們就知道在前些時候，男女婚姻是極端自由的，那時雖然釀成一種［禮交］制度只求性慾的滿足但並不防碍社會的進步，他們或她們，仍然是同様的生活在愉快的圈套中，過着［人］的生涯！殆至產業革命後，私有制度興起，一夫多妻制便成立了！在這時候，男子可用錢來買幾個女人，凡稍爲富裕之人，卽須蓄妾三四，以點綴門面。在許多地方的風俗，若在稠人廣衆之中，問及某富人只有一妻，則被問者及坐衆，無形中皆覺不甚［體面］。這尤足證明多妻爲富人之奢侈品。在這裏，我們就應該注意到那種的婚姻制度，不是基於雙方的感情或愛情，而起的結婚作用；他們完全把女子當成一種私有的財產和奴隸，利用女子發洩他們自己的性慾罷了，一切都是建議個人的滿足和自己的慾望上，這卽所謂舊式婚姻。</p>
<p>自由戀愛的旗幟展開之後，大家都承認結婚是以雙方的情感所使然，以共同意志，能结合而結合。這種結婚，不是以金錢可以置得到手的，純是以雙方的感情和一切思想要求相同的，才能走到結合的路。但因爲目前社會组織的畸形化，而造成的結果，所以弄得許多事，都走到一個極端奇形怪狀的路上去！而男女婚姻問題，更得不到一個澈底的解决辦法，許多還是遵守宗法禮敎的約束，將婚姻當成商品化。買賣化，一般陳腐的，享有封建餘毒的父母們，依舊要將自己的兒女，當成商品，希圖赚得大的利息。因此，在一般被賣成婚的女兒們，往往感到自己没有本領來衝破這萬惡的封建思想，和父母無理的命令，而又不願意遵守父母之命，媒灼之言嫁到一個陌生的，而自己不願意的男</p>
<p>人手裏去，所以希圖自殺自盡的觀念，遂猛然而生了！在這裏，我們更應很明顯的認識的承認；今後一方面我們固應</p>
<p>想法消極的來幾次舊式婚姻戒嚴運動的大示威，使尚未陷入這條死路的女同胞們起來堅决的反抗父母之命，媒灼之言的買賣式的婚姻；而他一方面，我們更應該卽速的起來，撑住新的旗幟，來推翻舊有的封建制度，培植些健全的人，使我們個個都在［人］的圈套裏眞實的生活下去！</p>

<p>炎夏的太陽，赤熱的晒着這靜寂的山坡，一切的東西，都好像是很疲倦似的喘息着，只有那不滿一丈寛的小澗，水還在潺潺地流動。</p>

<p>阿金的祖母，她已經是一個年近六十，而還不斷做着洗衣工作的老婆婆，她總是每天一清早起來，就跑到礦山上的職員宿舍裏去收衣服，回來之後等着阿金上工去了，她才獨自一個的到屋後的小澗邊去工作。一直的等到阿金放工回來，她才停了工作的去做着午飯。下　　半天，她又照例的到了放工的汽笛向後，回屋裏去做飯了。但是，一直的等到做完了飯還不見阿金回來，這可把她的心焦急起來了。</p>
<p>從礦山到阿金的家裏，是一條很直的約莫有三里遠的小路。所以阿金的祖母就跑出來站在這路口望着，因爲在這路口，可以一直的看見那從礦山走向這裏來的人。她這時站在這路口，心裏總是悸動着的，當她每很遠很遠的看到一個人跑來，她就滿想是她的孫兒回來了，但一等那人走近點，她就失望了，但她總是不管那人認得不認得的問着；［可有看見我的金兒？］然而人家每次的回答都說［不知道，］這可把她的心更急壤了。雖然這時的太陽好似火把般的燒在她的頭和背上，她身上的衣服也都濕透了汗水，頭也有點昏了，可是她要等着她的孫兒，一直的要等着她的孫兒回來。</p>
<p>時候已經是午後四時了，上工的都在礦洞裏工作，放工的也都回家去休息了，所以在這一條三里長的路上，就寂寞得連一條狗兒都没有了，阿金這時才從那礦山上的醫生室裏，慢慢地放着沉重的脚步走將出來。</p>
<p>原來阿金他在剛才還未放工的時候在礦洞裏昏倒了。</p>
<p>［你的身體太不行了，應該回去休息幾天，不然有了性命的危險，那是太麻煩了，］</p>
<p>阿金這時一面疲倦的走着，一面心裏不斷的想着剛才在病房裏醫生對他說的幾句話。但是，病是應該休息的，可是誰來給他飯吃呢？這在阿金的心裏，是一個再也不能解决的問題了。他每天做了八個鐘頭的工作，只的五毛錢的工資，還要養活多一個老祖母，要是没有做工；還能够有飯吃嗎？</p>
<p>阿金心裏的念頭是愈來愈多了，他更想到他的祖父，他的父親都是病了不能醫治而死，難道他做了七八年的礦工，就要和他的祖父和父親一様嗎？</p>
<p>這時阿金的祖母，遠遠地看見她的孫兒回來了，可是她的心，是更加的跳得厲害了。一直的到阿金走近了，她才嚇了一跳。</p>
<p>阿金的臉孔已經變成完全没有血色的蒼白了，吸呼很急促的，話也不能說的給他祖母扶進了那所破舊的家裏。</p>
<p>［金兒，怎様啦？］她祖母很急切的問着。</p>

In addition to expressing his views on saving the country, Hu did not have any other important talks. Hunan Province's finances have been extremely difficult in recent years, and it is still difficult to balance revenue and expenditure. As for the issue of the existence of the two Southwestern institutions, because it is a political issue, it was not mentioned during this trip. He only made a suggestion to the Central Committee members in the Southwest in his private capacity, stating that with the national crisis deepening, it is particularly important to be unified externally to consolidate the international position, and requested that the Southwest committees take the dignity of the country into consideration and no longer use the names of the two institutions to express opinions externally.

(6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Person in Charge of the Ordinary Mail Bureau Denies Unofficial Mail Communication</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The person in charge of the Beiping Postal Administration said that the report that there is already unofficial mail communication with the puppet state is not true. All postal conditions before the opening of the train service have not been changed in any way. Mail from the puppet state is still handled according to the previous blockade method, and items with unpaid postage are still charged unpaid postage. The claim of unofficial mail communication and exemption from unpaid postage is completely unfounded. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Beiping-Shenyang train service opened, it was widely rumored that the issue of mail communication would also be discussed. According to the Ministry of Communications, this matter concerns the Universal Postal Union, and is not as easy to resolve as the local issue of train service. Our side has not yet discussed this matter with the Japanese side. The authorities believe that it is not beneficial for us to communicate by mail before the four northeastern provinces are recovered. Various external rumors are not true. According to sources from the post office, since the General Post Office was ordered to block postal services in the Northeast after September 18, it has not been opened to this day. All letters sent to the puppet Manchuria are either stored in the post office or returned to the original address. Even if there is mail from Beiping to the Northeast, it only goes as far as Shanhaiguan, and it is still suspended beyond the pass. This is a fact well known to the people of the country. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Reception of Malanyu Still Has Problems</h3>
<p>Yin Rugeng Negotiates with Chiba Again</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The reception of Malanyu is scheduled to take place on the 18th, and our side has made preparations. Therefore, Yin Rugeng and Chiba negotiated again in Beiping. Although the reception will take place on the 18th, it will only be a formality. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Regard Rehe as a Base of Operations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Someone from Rehe Province said that the Japanese army is carrying out large-scale military plans in Rehe. A military railway has been set up between Chifeng and Tongliao, directly connected to the puppet territory. A railway is currently being built between Chifeng, Chaoyang, and Dayagou, which will be directly connected to the Beining Road and Huludao. This transportation route is not only important for military purposes, but also has great economic value, as it can absorb the products of Rehe Province and Inner Mongolia. There are also military motor roads set up between Linxi, Dolun, and Gubeikou, which are all connected to Chifeng and Chengde. The Japanese army stationed in Rehe has about two divisions, and the puppet army also has about 10,000 people. The number of Japanese armed immigrants who have moved to various places is about 5,000. The Japanese army believes that the terrain of Rehe is majestic, and has decided to use Rehe as a base of operations. In addition to the construction of military transportation roads,</p>
<h3>Someone Threw Stones and Destroyed Windows When the Beiping-Shenyang Train Passed Hanggu; the Japanese Police Escort Trial Period Has Expired; Clues Obtained in the Chadian Train Bombing Case</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After the Beiping-Shenyang train was bombed in Chadian, on the 5th, when the first train from Beiping to Shenyang passed Hanggu, villagers again threw a huge stone weighing about 50 or 60 catties from the mountain, breaking a third-class train window glass. Fortunately, no one was injured. Kusaota Ota, the director of the puppet Fengtian Railway Bureau, previously entered the pass to inspect the Beiping-Shenyang train service along the way, and went to Beiping to meet with Yin Tong. After finishing the matter, he took the Beiping-Shenyang train to Tianjin this morning, and returned to Shenyang after staying for a while. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese police escort of the Beiping-Shenyang train was originally a one-week trial, which has now expired. Yin Tong had visited and negotiated with Chiba about this matter. Chiba agreed to telegraph the Kwantung Army for instructions on whether to withdraw tomorrow, which is still difficult to determine. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) As of today, the government has not issued any orders to Tianjin regarding the resignation of Yin Tong and others. Today, Yin Tong did not go to the Road Bureau to work. At 11 a.m., Zheng Binzhao, Xu Wenguo, and the heads of various departments of the bureau went to Yin's residence on Haihe Road to persuade him to return to the bureau to handle official business first and retire after the Ministry's telegram arrives, but Yin did not agree. (6th Dispatch) (Tianjin) Someone received a report that a certain foreign firm in Tianjin was hiding 20 large bombs as samples. Each bomb was equipped with a spring that could prevent it from exploding for four hours. After four hours, the fuse would burn to the spring and explode. Recently, these 20 bombs have disappeared. It is unknown who bought them. The disappearance occurred two days before the Chadian train bombing case. The authorities believe that there are clues and are secretly investigating. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chengde has newly established radio stations and arsenals, and is building bunkers and gun emplacements everywhere. They are also building large-scale airfields in Chifeng, Chengde, Gubeikou, and other places. The Japanese military officers have the ambitious goal of building a "New Continent Empire." (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Negotiation on the Newly Compiled Special Police Team in Eastern Hebei Has Stalled</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong told reporters that the issue of the newly compiled special police team in eastern Hebei has been stalled. Although Chairman Huang has telegraphed Yin Tong to be responsible for the negotiation, Yin suddenly had the intention to resign due to the train bombing case. Therefore, this matter has also stalled and can only be discussed after Huang returns to Beiping. It is expected that Huang will return soon. The number of personnel and firearms for this matter have been concluded in the negotiation, so it must be resolved in one fell swoop. If it is not thoroughly negotiated, there will inevitably be further complications in the future. Therefore, although the province is anxious, it does not matter in these few days. Reports that Yi Wo and Chiba came to Tianjin to hold a meeting with our side are not true. Without Huang's return, there is no need for a meeting. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong said that after the train service issue is resolved, the general public ideally believes that the war zone can be pacified, but in reality, the situation remains the same. Although no major events have occurred recently, the number of gambling dens and opium dens set up by Japanese and Korean vagrants in various places is countless. Our side is unable to ban them. If we are too serious, not only will it be ineffective, but it will also increase the number. There is no result in negotiating with the Japanese side, which is truly helpless. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Puppet Organization Implements the Abolition of Provinces and Changes to Circuits; The Puppet Army Implements Reductions</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The puppet state implemented the abolition of provinces and changes to circuits on July 1st. The puppet governors Shi Yi, Xi Qia, Sun Qichang, and Zhang Hai Peng each only hold one position. The puppet provincial garrison commanders have also been dismissed.

<h3>Two Companies of the Puppet Army Mutiny, Flee to Mangniuyingzi; Japanese Aircraft Bombing Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Two companies of cavalry under the command of Zhang Junzhe of the puppet Rehe army mutinied on the 3rd after hearing the puppet government's downsizing order. Led by a company commander surnamed Liu, they fled to the vicinity of Luanping. Japanese aircraft have begun bombing, and part of the puppet cavalry is also encircling them.

<h3>Prank Phone Call: False Report of Principal's Death Deceives South China Morning Post</h3>

That morning, a reporter from the newspaper inquired about the details by telephone to the college and was shocked to hear Mr. Balderton himself answer, saying, "I am not speaking from another world; I am still alive and well."

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Current Situation in North China</h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>The Ping-Shen through-train issue, after countless twists and turns, has finally been resolved in a compromised manner. It is said that the remaining unresolved issues in the North China war zone can now be discussed according to the pre-arranged agreements after the through-train's implementation. Considering the various setbacks in the past regarding the through-train issue, we know that the price paid for discussing the unresolved issues in the war zone with the implementation of the through-train as a prerequisite is considerable. However, we still dare not expect the outcome of the discussions to be above ordinary expectations.</p>
<p>Let us assume that the withdrawal of Japanese and puppet troops from Luanyu District and the various passes of the Great Wall and the implementation of the replacement of the old and new security forces in the Ji-Luan areas can all be accomplished. It cannot be said that it is entirely satisfactory. The war zone issue, which has been delayed for a long time, cannot be fundamentally resolved because of this. Taking a step back, let's talk about recovering the customs departments. The Japanese army has already built extremely solid military installations at various important passes, and the puppet government has also established customs checkpoints and administrative agencies. Recovering a few customs posts still cannot avoid being nominal, and various disputes can arise at any time. For example, according to the verbal agreement of the Tanggu Armistice, the newly formed war zone security force was supposed to have nine thousand men. However, only eight thousand have completed training and are ready to enter the war zone, while the Japanese insist on limiting it to the current number of six thousand men and classify light machine guns as heavy weapons and do not allow them to be carried. These two points alone are enough to imagine the difficulty of resolving the outstanding issues in the war zone. Originally, in the present day, any negotiations with Japan will not be a pleasant experience unless one admits to compromise or concession. How much more so is the deeply rooted and complex North China issue?</p>
<p>We know that the Japanese have planned three steps for the invasion of North China. The first step is to destroy the strategic passes, which has been completed with the end of the war along the Great Wall. The second step is to deploy a encirclement, which is being carried out step by step with the tactic of increasing troops in Malanyu and eastern Chahar. The third step is to expand latent forces, such as organizing and supplying bandits in eastern Chahar and eastern Luan, colluding with traitors, and anesthetizing people's minds. Under the current situation, it goes without saying that resisting the first step of the Japanese is already too late. Dealing with their second step is also easier said than done. Only the third step is relatively recoverable, and if it is done, it will indeed be of great benefit to North China. However, it is expected that our side will not specifically bring it up at the negotiation table for the outstanding issues in the war zone. Even if it is brought up, the Japanese will definitely not acknowledge it. Even if they acknowledge it, we cannot do anything about it.</p>
<p>However, the danger of the third step is no less poisonous than the other two steps, and perhaps even more so, because it is a method of attacking the mind, a means of killing with a borrowed knife. According to some observers, the Japanese are not currently in a hurry to encompass North China by force, and that third step is characterized by long-term gradual "sublimation and silent transfer," so it is most terrifying. However, as long as we can rise up quickly, grit our teeth, hold firm to our principles, and work hard relentlessly, it may not be impossible to salvage the situation. The most important method of "hard work" is to restore popular sentiment and stabilize people's livelihoods. Although the opportunity is becoming more urgent by the day, the opportunity to eliminate the Japanese's expansion of latent forces is still within our scope of power, and the resistance ahead is still relatively small. Any later, and it may be too late.</p>
<p>Recently, two people returned from observing North China and talked about the alarming situation of declining morale in North China. It is said that collusion between the Japanese and local ruffians is an open fact in the war zone. Unexpectedly, the ignorant people actually take pride in interacting with Japanese officials and regard Japanese friendship as a talisman, while their faith and respect for the central government are far less than in the southeastern provinces. We can scold them as traitors, but the term "traitor" is not as serious in their eyes as it is for people in other regions. It is also said that the atmosphere of studying Japanese and the Japanese language in North China is extremely popular, but their motive is by no means based on the rebellious mentality of "knowing yourself and your enemy." Rather, it is based on premeditating to act as obedient subjects in a conquered country and obtain a better place to eat. The observations of a few people are not enough to represent the full truth of the facts, but at least they can reflect one aspect of the effect of Japanese coercion and enticement. If this continues, it will not only lead to the loss of the country, but also to the extinction of the race.</p>
<p>Now, to put it bluntly, apart from acknowledging past mistakes and quickly implementing the "hard work" methods mentioned above, there is no other miracle cure. The government must first let the people know that the years of compromise and conciliation are not without a corresponding limit and are the unavoidable means of implementing its final determination. Then, use facts to prove that it is necessary to alleviate the people's suffering within the possible scope, and that the government's prestige and dignity must be maintained. We do not believe that a country's people can be anesthetized by foreigners and not be influenced by their own people. The folk customs of North China are known to be simple and honest, which is its strength, but precisely because of its simplicity and honesty, it is easily fooled by the Japanese and traitors, which is also its shortcoming. If the government wants to reverse the precarious situation in North China, please first focus its efforts on the people of North China, and then consider other things. This is the real outstanding issue in the war zone. Recovering a few customs posts and adding a few security troops are not peripheral issues in comparison.</p>

<h3>Political Parties Unwilling to Be Disregarded: Japan's Cabinet Formation Encounters Reefs: Okada Consults with Seiyukai President; Agreement or Rupture to Be Decided Today</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Okada Cabinet decided on the 5th to retain Foreign Minister Hirota and the Ministers of Finance and Justice, and then began negotiations with the Seiyukai. However, as a result of the hour-long meeting between Seiyukai's Mochizuki Keisuke and Okada, Mochizuki refused to join the cabinet. Therefore, the meeting between Okada and Tokonami also failed to materialize. The Seiyukai held an elders' meeting at President Suzuki's residence and a cadre meeting at its headquarters to discuss countermeasures, but to no avail. Prime Minister Okada, who was waiting for a response at the Prime Minister's official residence, returned to his residence at 11:30 PM. The cabinet formation work, which had been proceeding smoothly, stalled on the second day due to the reef of political party relations. (Japan United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai's President Suzuki met with General Okada today. Based on that situation, a joint meeting of elders and general affairs will be held at 8:00 PM on the 6th, and a cadre meeting will be held at headquarters at 10:00 PM. A meeting of Diet members will also be convened today, at which the president will report on the progress, and then a formal decision can be made on the attitude. (Japan United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Okada's Cabinet Formation Policy Does Not Allow Political Parties to Occupy Key Positions: A Transcendental Cabinet Is Not Easily Realized</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The relationship between the Okada Cabinet and the Seiyukai is gradually deteriorating. The Seiyukai originally requested the position of Minister of Home Affairs, but Prime Minister Okada considers the thorough eradication of discipline and reform of the political world to be major tasks. To achieve this goal, he does not hesitate to dissolve the 67th Diet, so his attitude is quite strong and he resolutely does not allow the Seiyukai to occupy the key position of Minister of Home Affairs. (Japan United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai held a meeting of elders and general affairs last night and decided to ascertain General Okada's sincerity before making a final decision on their attitude. However, the general trend is one of dissatisfaction, leaning towards rejection. Last night at 11:30 PM, Prime Minister Okada, on the second night of cabinet formation, told reporters regarding this matter, "The result of the Seiyukai's elders' meeting leaves no room for further consideration. The fundamental policy of my cabinet formation is to seek the position of Minister of Home Affairs from someone other than a political party member." (Electric Communication dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Okada's cabinet formation policy is said to allocate the four ministries of Communications, Railways, Commerce and Industry, and Colonial Affairs to the political party side. However, no matter what happens, he is unwilling to part with any other ministries. Regarding the rumors of abolishing the Colonial Affairs Ministry, he denied having such an opinion because he currently feels the need for overseas development. He also said that he had not considered the rumor of the Prime Minister concurrently holding the position of Minister of Colonial Affairs. (Electric Communication dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Mochizuki Keisuke is afraid that he will absolutely refuse to join the cabinet. As a result, Prime Minister Okada will break ties with the Seiyukai and form a new cabinet. At this time, the Minseito has no objections to its members joining the cabinet. Therefore, President Wakatsuki of the Minseito will withdraw his previous statement and organize a purely transcendental cabinet. The work of organizing the cabinet affairs is temporarily suspended until the relationship with the Seiyukai is clarified. Therefore, the resolution of this cabinet formation work, and how it will negotiate with the Seiyukai, is now at the crossroads of rupture and compromise, and the entire matter will be handled on the 7th. (Japan United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Bureaucratization of the New Japanese Cabinet: Financial Groups Abandon Political Parties for Emerging Forces; Appointing Bureaucrats Avoids Political-Military Disputes</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The bureaucratization of the new Okada Cabinet is now very clear. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Elder Saionji is originally a giant of the bureaucracy. (2) The Mitsui financial group, in view of the times, suspended its investment in the Seiyukai and approached the faction of Vice President Hiranuma of the Privy Council. The Mitsubishi financial group also gradually reduced its investment in the Minseito because it manages many military supplies industries and is particularly close to the military. As a result, both the political and popular parties lack military funds. There is no hope of restoring political party politics in these years, and the financial groups are tending towards emerging forces. (3) The fate of the Okada Cabinet can be said to be unaffected by political parties. With the support of the emerging bureaucratic forces and the moderate faction within the military, it can be independent and secure. (4) When Army Minister Hayashi remained in office, Okada promised to implement military policies. Therefore, key positions were not filled by political party members to avoid prompting disputes between the military and political parties. (China United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Seiyukai Opens Elders' Meeting</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to decide the party's attitude regarding whether Tokonami and Mochizuki should join the cabinet, the Seiyukai held a joint consultative meeting of party elders and general affairs officers at 8:00 PM last night, which lasted for three hours. Mochizuki Keisuke, Kuhara Nosuke, Tokonami Takejiro, Okazaki Kunisuke, Mizuno Rentaro, Ogawa Heikichi, Yamamoto Jotaro, Yamamoto Tei, Mitsuchi Chuzo, Hatoyama Ichiro, Kawamura Takeji, Akita Kiyoshi, Shimada Toshio, Maeda Mizo, Tobu, Wakamiyasadao, etc., attended. First, Mochizuki gave a detailed report on his visit to the new Prime Minister Okada that evening and his refusal to join the cabinet. Tokonami also expressed his unwillingness to join the cabinet. The result of the consultation was a unanimous agreement that the Seiyukai should deal with this extraordinary situation with national unity. Dividing important positions such as Minister of Home Affairs and Minister of Finance among others and giving the Seiyukai idle positions is to despise the existence of political parties. Therefore, formal national unity is meaningless at this time. It was decided to once again ask President Suzuki to ascertain the sincerity of the new Prime Minister Okada before deciding on a final attitude. (Electric Communication dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Goto Runs Around as a Mediator</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Goto visited Mochizuki Keisuke at midnight this morning, listened in detail to the Seiyukai's attitude towards joining the cabinet negotiations, and reported to the new Prime Minister Okada. He left at 1:15 AM. Regarding his meeting with Mochizuki, Goto told reporters that he strongly hoped that Mochizuki would join the cabinet. Therefore, despite the late hour, he visited again to make an earnest request, and also intended to ask Tokonami to join the cabinet. (Electric Communication dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Mochizuki and Tokonami Refuse to Join the Cabinet</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Mochizuki Keisuke visited General Okada at 1:15 PM today and held talks for forty minutes. The content was in response to General Okada's urging him to join the cabinet, to which he replied that there was no room for further consideration and refused to join the cabinet. Therefore, in order to break the impasse, General Okada entrusted him to mediate with the Seiyukai. Mochizuki considered the request and visited President Suzuki to report in detail on the events of his meeting with General Okada. Mochizuki said, "My problem has now been eliminated. I only exchanged opinions with General Okada on the cabinet formation policy." (Electric Communication)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Goto visited Tokonami and held talks for two hours before leaving. It is said that Tokonami is unwilling to join the cabinet and today's meeting yielded no results. (Japan United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Minseito Watches Developments</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Okada intends to resolve the negotiations with the Seiyukai today and then visit Minseito President Wakatsuki. The Minseito is currently paying close attention to the attitude of the cabinet and the Seiyukai and is considering countermeasures. The Minseito has decided on a policy to assist the cabinet and the government. If the government's policy does not change, it will send someone to join the cabinet. However, if the government breaks ties with the Seiyukai and prevents political party members from joining the cabinet, it will consider the government to be disregarding political parties and will implement a coup to overthrow its abnormal cabinet, which is not nationally unified.

<h3>Schleicher Said to Be Colluding with France</h3>
<p>(Berlin) An American news agency in London published a message stating that former German Prime Minister Schleicher was involved in a large-scale conspiracy against Hitler, and that France has been involved for several weeks. German newspapers reprinted this message, intentionally exaggerating it to make it sensational. All believe that this kind of news is credible, saying that Hitler had a legitimate reason to shoot Schleicher. For example, the Nazi Party's attack newspaper said, "[Those who collude with foreign countries and betray the motherland deserve to die]." (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) An American news agency published a message in London stating that France was involved in a German conspiracy. This message was reprinted by German newspapers.

<p>(Berlin) According to semi-official sources, since the events of June 30th, forty-six people have been executed using simple procedures in Berlin alone. Those who were accidentally killed or "committed suicide" may not be included in the calculation. As for those executed in other places, there is no information available for verification. There are rumors here that President Hindenburg has ordered a state funeral for the late State Minister and Minister of Defense Schleicher to show that he does not believe in the accusations of treason against Schleicher. However, the circumstances of the burial of Mr. and Mrs. Schleicher were extremely cold. When relatives went to the police station to claim Schleicher's body, they were refused.

(Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Pravda published a new essay by Radek on the current state of affairs in Germany. Radek said, "[It will take time for the world to know in detail what is happening behind the scenes of the German fascist dictatorship. The foreign political reasons for these events have not yet been clarified. It is rumored that Horning conducted negotiations with representatives of British imperialism to ensure British assistance to the Nazi Party's leadership in suppressing the [extremists]. This matter indicates some important internal aspects of these events. The competition among the monopolistic capitalist groups regarding the issue of currency inflation has a greater impact on these events than the internal rebellion of the Stormtroopers. Finally, when Hitler and General Blomberg went to the North Sea, the conditions he fulfilled to the Defense Forces have not yet been determined. However, the historical significance of the events is already clear. German fascism has been a tool of the monopolistic bourgeoisie from the beginning. Its ability to seize power is precisely because it can use the "national movement" as a cover to save the petty bourgeoisie from extinction. Today, the fascist bandits have had to launch a head-on blow against their social supporters, the petty bourgeoisie. The most recent result of this will be the increasingly profound anti-fascist revolutionary struggle." (TASS dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>French Parliament Passes Naval Bill; Naval Minister Announces Relations with Italy</h3>
<p>(Paris) Both houses of Parliament today worked diligently to complete various matters so that the upcoming holiday would not be shortened. The most important bill, concerning the construction of warships, was passed by the Senate with a vote of 281 to 22. This bill, previously passed by the House of Representatives, stipulates the construction of one "Dunkerque"-class battleship (26,500 tons), one destroyer, and two submarines. Naval Minister Pietri declared that before the 1935 naval conference, another capital ship would be built, but he could not yet say whether it would be a "Dunkerque"-class or a 35,000-ton vessel. He hoped it would not be the latter. It is believed that Pietri made this announcement because the Italian government recently decided to build two 35,000-ton capital ships. The Senate also passed a financial reform bill. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Naval Minister Pietri attended the Senate, where senators raised many questions about the naval conference and asked him to answer. Pietri said that regarding the naval conference, Britain and France would hold preliminary talks in London. He could not answer all the questions one by one, but he could say that France's views on disarmament had not changed and would not change in the future. As for Italy's recent decision to build two 35,000-ton cruisers, France does not need to respond immediately. The best approach is to clearly assert France's rights according to the shipbuilding plans allowed by treaties. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Staffordshire Chamberlain Eden delivered an important speech here tonight, explaining Britain's attitude towards security issues. Eden recounted the reasons for the failure of the disarmament conference after Germany's unprovoked withdrawal from Geneva. Eden then said that there are two types of security: one is territorial security, for which Britain will fully implement the Locarno Treaty to protect Western Europe; the other is security within the scope of the disarmament convention, that is, all countries that signed the disarmament convention agree to guarantee the implementation of the convention. Eden continued, "[The French government has consistently refused to recognize Germany's rearmament. However, any disarmament convention that does not include clauses allowing Germany to rearm immediately will inevitably be formally opposed by Germany.]" Eden then described the proposals made by Italy and Soviet Russia one by one and criticized them. Eden concluded by saying that no country has expressed doubt about Britain's armaments, but the current situation is so serious that Britain's armaments have been greatly reduced, and it is feared that it will not be able to fulfill its obligations. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) All British newspapers have published detailed reports on Britain's plans for military expansion, and the declaration of the Staffordshire Chamberlain Eden is particularly valued by public opinion. According to the Daily Mail, Britain's military increase, new plans have been drafted by experts, for the air force, it is recommended to add 600 new aircraft, and the status of British cruisers must be raised to the so-called "Pi Ai Di" standard. Therefore, Britain must build at least 20 new cruisers in the next two or three years. Furthermore, there is now a proposal to move the arsenal currently located in the Woolwich area to the interior, because the arsenal is one of Britain's major arsenals, employing 20,000 workers, but its location is near the sea and easily threatened by mainland aircraft.

<p>(London) The British newspapers are quite pessimistic about the naval conference to be convened tomorrow. According to the Daily Telegraph's diplomatic reporter, the divergence of opinions among countries on naval issues is already very obvious. The reporter also said that France has informally inquired with the British government about Britain's views on the various naval clauses stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles, and the Daily Leader said that before Japan's attitude has been expressed, it is really difficult to predict the future of the naval conference. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Senator Perrenget, chairman of the Senate Political Committee, issued a statement today, dispelling misunderstandings about Foreign Minister Barthou's visit to London, saying that the most dangerous speculation is that Britain can change France's attitude in Geneva and then conclude a treaty with France. Given the current situation of the British government and its territories, it is unrealistic to hope that Britain will put forward more binding and broader proposals. The semi-official Petit Parisien discussed Franco-British relations, saying that without the environment of [19]14, seeking a closer alliance is just deceiving oneself. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>US-Japan Competition in Pacific Shipping</h3>
<p>(Washington) The increase in tonnage and speed of Japanese merchant ships has attracted the attention of the shipping industry. This matter may prompt the U.S. government to decide on its permanent shipping policy. Japan's shipbuilding plan of "replacing two with one" not only drastically increases the convenience of Japan's modern cargo transport but also reduces its old ships to a tonnage smaller than other countries. Naval tacticians believe that Japan possesses potential ships sufficient for wartime use to increase naval power. Therefore, the current government is paying attention to the final impact of the new cargo ships. The shipbuilding bill passed by the Japanese parliament in 1932 plans to build 200,000 tons of new merchant ships and demolish 400,000 tons of old ships. According to recent reports obtained here, keels have been laid for 31 new ships, totaling approximately 199,310 tons. 93 old ships have been demolished, totaling approximately 393,000 tons. It is said that the shipping industry is still demanding the expansion of shipbuilding. According to statistics, Britain and Ireland build the most ships, followed by Japan, while the United States has fallen to tenth place. Britain and Ireland built 481,440 tons in the three months before March 31, Japan built 122,590 tons, and the United States built 27,344 tons. In the same three months last year, Britain built 331,000 tons, Japan built 106,760 tons, and the United States [blank]. The progress of Japan's merchant ships in the Pacific shipping industry can be proven by the fact that Japanese merchant ships carry 70 percent of the raw silk shipped to the United States and goods worth US$21 million. In the U.S. foreign trade in 1932, Japanese merchant ships carried U.S. exports worth US$67,281,000 and imports worth US$120,653,000. All countries and Japanese merchant ships loaded U.S. exports worth US$893,203,000 and imports worth US$733,831,000. U.S. merchant ships loaded exports worth US$469,720,000 and imports worth US$430,631,000. In U.S.-Japan trade, Japanese ships carry the most goods. In 1932, Japanese ships transported U.S. goods worth US$59,971,000 back to Japan and transported Japanese goods worth US$82,368,000 into the United States. U.S. ships only carried U.S. exports worth US$15,758,000 and imports worth US$28,511,000. All countries and Japanese merchant ships loaded U.S. exports worth US$116,870,000 and imports worth US$104,748,000. Therefore, the United States is not as good as Japan in trans-Pacific shipping. In 1932, Japanese ships transported goods from Fiji to the United States worth US$21,145,000, but U.S. goods transported to Fiji were only worth US$91,000. All countries and Japanese merchant ships transported U.S. goods to Fiji worth a total of US$27,290,000 and transported goods from Fiji into the United States worth US$47 [blank] 760,000.

<h3>Australia to Send Trade Representatives to the Far East, Does Not Intend to Establish Diplomatic Relations with Japan</h3>
<p>Australian Canberra: Australian Deputy Prime Minister Latham recently visited China, Japan, and other countries and has completed a report, which was submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion today, but no vote was taken. Latham's report advocates sending Australian trade representatives to major commercial ports such as Shanghai, Tokyo, Batavia, and Hong Kong to facilitate the promotion of commercial relations, but it does not advocate establishing direct diplomatic relations with Japan, because Australia's relations with Japan are currently handled by the British Foreign Office and are still fully satisfactory.

<h3>German Debt Problem; US Demands Same Treatment as Britain</h3>
<p>(Washington) State Department officials indicated today that the United States will lodge a strong protest if Germany does not give American holders of Dawes and Young Plan bonds the same treatment as British bondholders. Last week, Secretary of State Hull sent a note to the German government, stating that Berlin's explanation for the suspension of debt payments was completely unsatisfactory to the United States. The United States cannot tolerate Germany discriminating against American bondholders. However, the note stated that the United States has no opinion on the Dawes and Young Plans, as the United States is not a signatory to these two plans. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is widely believed that the agreement between Britain and Germany on the settlement of debts may lead to satisfactory results in similar negotiations that Germany is currently conducting with other governments. The Anglo-German agreement is quite welcome here. Government newspapers particularly note the preface, in which Britain acknowledges Germany's position, that Germany can only repay debts with goods, and that the increase in Germany's export trade and the improvement in its import and export trade balance are preliminary conditions for repaying debts.

<h3>San Francisco Dockworkers in Fierce Battle with Police; Bricks and Tear Gas Fly; Coast Guard Ordered to Deploy</h3>
<p>San Francisco: Riots and bloodshed continued throughout the day. By 5:30 p.m., the police dispersed the striking crowd, and the situation gradually calmed down. A total of two people died and 52 were injured, all of whom have been sent to hospitals. Among them, 22 suffered gunshot wounds, and several are in critical condition. During the riot, the police suppressed the crowd. Although California Governor Merriam had ordered the troops to deploy, they had not yet moved out by the evening. Military officials claimed yesterday that they could move out at any time. Today, approximately 3,000 workers fought with the police. Gunfire erupted, and police threw tear gas and vomiting gas at the crowd, who responded with bricks and other objects. The riot started in the square in front of the barge wharf, when the barge was carrying a thousand passengers to the port. The police then locked them in the wharf gate for protection. The fighting outside the gate was fierce. After about half an hour, the police gradually pushed back the workers. The workers tried to re-establish their line, but they were still broken by the police. The employees of the San Francisco Coastal Railway and the California Industrial Association were able to safely transport goods from the wharf to the warehouses because the workers did not pay attention to them. The commander of the 250th Coastal Artillery Regiment of the California National Guard announced this afternoon that the team had been ordered to suppress the riot and could deploy within a few hours. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Salt Lake City: This afternoon, Governor Merriam ordered the National Guard to deploy to maintain order in San Francisco. Earlier, the governor received a telephone report stating that riots had broken out again in the coastal area of San Francisco, and striking workers were planning to block the transportation of state-owned railways. The governor therefore took this action. Governor Merriam ordered the San Francisco National Guard to prepare to deal with the incident. The situation deteriorated rapidly. The governor had just ordered the 250th Coastal Artillery Regiment to depart for the coastal area. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>

<p>Amsterdam: Today, there were Communist rioters demonstrating against the reduction of unemployment benefits, which led to riots. The Communists behaved violently, and soon clashed with the police.

<h3>Japan Warns Soviet Russia; Accuses the "Soviet-Russian Friendship Association" of Promoting Communism</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The "Soviet-Russian Friendship Association," which was organized by Akita Ujaku and others in the 6th year of Showa (1931) to promote Japanese-Soviet cultural exchange, appeared to be a reservoir for the Communist Party. The Metropolitan Police Department felt that it was inappropriate and summoned Mr. Kajo Fujimasa, the editor in charge of the organization's magazine, to the foreign affairs section for questioning. It was found that the magazine was organized in the 6th year of Showa, had 300 members, and that the magazine was issued and received subsidies and assistance from the Soviet-Russian embassy. From the perspective of a legitimate organization linking Japanese and Soviet-Russian culture, there is nothing inappropriate about this "Soviet-Russian Friendship Association." However, today, Communist Party members continue to be discovered among its members. In light of this fact, in order to ask the Soviet-Russian embassy authorities to consider this, its actual state is pointed out, and a warning document has been prepared and delivered to the Soviet-Russian embassy.

<h3>Drought in Kyushu, Japan; Troops Fire Cannons to Pray for Rain</h3>
<p>Nagasaki: There has been very little rainfall in the northern Kyushu area for the past three weeks.

According to Yin's conversation this morning [Although the Ministry of Railways has tried to retain me after my resignation, I am unwilling to easily resume my duties when the responsibilities I bear are not fully guaranteed. At most, I will overstep my bounds. I will temporarily not ask about the affairs of the Railway Bureau until I resume my duties] and so on.</p>
<h3>Postal Services and Customs Issues</h3>
<p>At the Tanggu Armistice Conference, the accessory requirements verbally proposed by the Japanese side were only three matters: opening of traffic, postal services, and the establishment of customs at various passes of the Great Wall. Now the opening of traffic has been realized, and postal services are being planned in accordance with the principles decided by the League of Nations, with the aim of restoring international postal services. Although there are no clear regulations yet, it is already being implemented in fact. It is estimated that more than 30,000 pieces of international mail are sent to Europe via Shanhaiguan every day. The number of postal packages entering and leaving Shanhaiguan, including European international mail, totals more than 400 packages per month. They are received and delivered at Shanhaiguan with informal procedures, with both sides separately stamping insufficient postage and delivering them as usual. Secondly, regarding the issue of establishing customs, since we have never recognized the Great Wall as the national border, we have only established sub-cards of the Tianjin Customs at five passes northeast of Shanhaiguan: Jielingkou, Yiyuankou, Lengkou, Xifengkou, and Gubeikou. The Ministry of Finance has dispatched personnel to start preparations and will establish them soon. The only thing that has not been realized is the formal postal and remittance services outside the customs. Recently, it was learned that compatriots outside the customs had a record of remitting 40 to 50 million yuan into the customs each year in the past. In view of the needs, it has been decided to start preparations for restoration. Since we have implemented everything that our country should implement, all sections that the Japanese side should implement, such as the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the war zone outside the Great Wall and the rotation of the war zone security team, should also be resolved immediately. However, since there are still obstacles, all negotiations must wait until Huang Fu, Chairman of the Political Reorganization Committee, returns north before they can proceed.</p>
<h3>East Mausoleums Takeover Measures</h3>
<p>The issue of taking over the war zone will gradually proceed after the opening of traffic. Now, Tao Shangming, Commissioner of the Yu District, Yin Rugeng, Commissioner of the Ji Mi District, and Shibayama, Military Attaché of the Japanese Embassy, have agreed to take over the East Mausoleums first. There are three measures: (1) The date for the implementation of the takeover is set before the 18th; (2) All Japanese puppet troops stationed in the East Mausoleums will be completely withdrawn. The protection of the East Mausoleums will be the responsibility of a company from the war zone security team; (3) After the takeover, the Jizhou Mi District Commissioner's Office of the Hebei Provincial Government, the Xinglong County Government, and the Manchu Qing Dynasty Descendant Prince Heshuo will jointly form an East Mausoleums Management Committee to manage the mausoleums. The original puppet Management Committee will be abolished. (5th)</p>
<h3>Three Provincial Headquarters Prohibit Disguised Organizations of the Red Bandits</h3>
<p>Consolidation of the Bandit Area's Public Education, Investigation of Economic Decline - Hankou Correspondence: The Three Provincial Bandit Suppression Headquarters believes that the Red Bandits of the three provinces are collapsing after being severely suppressed by the National Army. According to reports, the Red Bandits have changed their strategy, shifted their targets, colluded with local bandits, secret society bandits, and Green and Red Gang bandits under the false name of the "Guangdan Society," organized institutions, and incited the poor. They have been very active recently. They have been discovered in all three provinces. The internal organization is indeed masterminded by the Red Bandits to avoid social attention and attempt to expand the scope. At a time when the rural areas are bankrupt and the four classes of people are unemployed, this kind of disguised organization of the Red Bandits cannot be allowed to exist. A special order has been issued to the military and political organs of the three provinces to earnestly prohibit them in order to eliminate hidden dangers. In addition, public education in the bandit area is the only effective weapon to correct the people's thinking and change the people's psychology. In the past, the highest military officers stationed in each area were responsible for establishing Zhongshan Public Schools in accordance with the Measures for the Implementation of Public Education in the Recovered Bandit Areas and the Outline of Facilities. Recently, it has been found that some have dealt with the matter perfunctorily, resulting in no results. Three measures for rectification are specially stipulated: (1) In addition to the matters concerning calculation, the Zhongshan Public Schools run by each unit shall comply with the prescribed forms and the points that should be paid attention to in the previous order and shall also fill in two copies of the general situation report form and two copies of the student roster in accordance with the format of the roster issued this time and submit them to the headquarters by the 15th of the following month for verification; (2) Each unit must submit the books and forms that should be reported for the previous month when applying to the headquarters for public school funds each month. They will be issued only after they are reported to the headquarters. However, before the funds are issued, the educational and administrative expenses required by the school should be advanced by the unit itself, and the education should not be interrupted in the slightest; (3) The funds for this public school must be effectively and properly distributed by each unit and shall not be misappropriated on any pretext to emphasize public education. As for the economic situation of the provinces, due to the influence of bandit loyalty, trade has sharply decreased, industry and commerce have declined, rural areas are on the verge of bankruptcy, and the social foundation is shaking. This is the entire phenomenon of Central China and should also be strived for rescue. A special foreign consultant, Duanner, has been appointed to organize the China Economic Survey Society to investigate the conditions of various industries, deduce the reasons for their decline, and attempt to restore their former prosperity. The investigation has now begun. (5th)</p>

<h3>Yan Huiqing Arrives in Qingdao - Will Meet Gu Weijun in Shanghai; Spoke Freely about the International Situation While Passing Through Jinan</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Yan Huiqing, Ambassador to the Soviet Union, recently felt unwell and urgently needed to choose a place to recuperate. Having finished handling private affairs in Beiping and Tianjin, he specially took his wife, sons, and daughters on the Jiaoji Railway special train from Jinan to Qingdao at 11:40 pm on the 5th. He arrived at Qingdao Railway Station at 10:15 pm that night. Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee Ge Guangting, and various bureau chiefs and committee members of the Municipal Government and the Railway Bureau were all at the station to welcome him. After Yan got off the train, he shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcoming personnel and then took a car to the Yingbing Hotel to stay. According to Yan, his trip to Qingdao was because Qingdao has good air and the weather is not very hot, so he came to recuperate. There are no other tasks. His family can stay in Qingdao for two months. He intends to stay for a little over ten days and then go to Nanjing and Shanghai. He heard that Minister Gu Weijun is returning to the country and plans to meet him in Shanghai. When he arrived in Jinan, he met with Chairman Han. He saw that the current state of security in Shandong is very good, all thanks to Chairman Han's efforts to maintain it. Only when the place is quiet can the people live and work in peace, and then can we talk about construction. He heard that Qingdao's municipal administration has been vigorously managed by Mayor Shen recently and has developed greatly. He came to visit by the way. Moreover, Qingdao is the best summer resort on the coast of China. If it is managed properly, the future prosperity is really immeasurable. He lived in Switzerland for more than a year before, and many dignitaries from various countries went to that country for summer vacations. Seeing the equipment of the hotels and the thoughtfulness of the reception, it was truly impeccable. Therefore, it can attract a large number of tourists, and the lives of the people of that country also depend entirely on this income. Qingdao is no less than the second Switzerland in the East. (5th)</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Dr. Yan Huiqing, Ambassador to Russia, arrived in Jinan by train from Tianjin at 9:46 am today (the 5th) and transferred to Qingdao. After Yan got off the train in Jinan, he rested at the Jiaoji Hotel with his wife and children. His wife is the younger sister of former Prime Minister Sun Baoqi, and she is also an old woman now. Yan is still in good spirits. Zhang Dongcun, a member of the provincial government, went to visit him and informed Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu by telephone. After a while, Han and Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun both arrived and talked freely with him. Reporters also went to listen to their discussions. Yan asked a lot about Shandong's politics. Han asked him to stay in Jinan for a short stay, but Yan declined, saying that he would listen to his teachings again when he returned to Jinan. Yan was extremely talkative, eloquently discussing world affairs. After about an hour, Han and others bid farewell and left. At 11:40 am, Yan took the Jiaoji Railway train to Qingdao again. The following is a record of what Yan said:</p>
<h3>Resignation Not Approved</h3>
<p>Yan said, [I plan to go to Qingdao for a short rest this time, arrange my family, and then go to Nanjing and Lushan to visit President Wang and Chairman Jiang separately. There is no date for returning to Russia. Originally, I have held every official position and have no achievements to speak of. For more than ten years, I have been living in Tianjin, running businesses and doing charity. After the September 18th Incident, Wang Rutang and Chairman Jiang sincerely ordered me to go to the United States, with an agreement of one year. After arriving in the United States for more than a month, I was ordered to go to Geneva and stay there for more than a year. Because of the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, which I handled, I was ordered to go to Russia. This will be a long-term position with no day of rest. Just when the relations between Japan and Russia were tense, I had to return to the country to ask for instructions on how to deal with the situation in the event of an incident between Japan and Russia. So I returned to the country and came to Peiping. The Xiehe Hospital found that my heart was enlarged. The doctor said that it was due to old age and excessive labor and that I needed to rest. Therefore, when I went to Beijing and Jiangxi to visit Jiang and Wang, I requested to resign, because young diplomatic talents are emerging and the old should step aside to make way for the virtuous. Jiang and Wang both said that it was out of the question and insisted on retaining me and not allowing me to retire. I said that if that was the case, if the relations between Japan and Russia were relatively eased and there was nothing to do in Russia, I would need to be given leave to rest for a period of time, which was approved. I originally planned to go to Weihaiwei for a tour, but I felt too lonely, so I changed my route to Qingdao.</p>
<h3>The Far East Situation</h3>
<p>Japan has no friends in various countries, because the Far East situation is like a table. Before the Washington Conference, the table was uneven due to competition among various countries, like a leg was missing. The Washington Conference Nine-Power Treaty was established, creating equilibrium, like the table was leveled again. But the September 18th Incident destroyed everything. The Japanese gained the Northeast as if they had gained land without a deed. Sooner or later someone will settle accounts with them. They wanted to sign a new treaty with the United States, but the United States said that the old treaty could not be maintained, so why talk about a new treaty? The implied meaning can be imagined. The Northeast issue is gradually expanding into the Far East issue. The United States and Russia are desperately expanding their armaments. Everyone knows what country they are targeting. Since Hirota came to power in Japan, he has been trying his best to salvage the situation, but his effectiveness is very small. The recent dumping of Japanese goods has aroused the jealousy of various countries.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Brothers</h3>
<p>I once told the Japanese that only China and Japan are larger in East Asia now and can represent the yellow race. We should seek common survival and work together. To put it bluntly, decades ago, Japan's culture and everything else were not good. China was the elder brother and Japan was the younger brother. In recent decades, you have worked hard and run ahead. But China can only retreat to being the younger brother and let you be the elder brother. You cannot treat yourself as the master and treat China as a slave. You must know that a country with 400 million people will never be willing to be a slave.</p>
<h3>Russian and German National Conditions</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union has vast land and a large population. In recent years, it has worked hard on construction and has no intention of invading others, but it will never allow others to invade it. Therefore, it pays great attention to armaments. The attitude towards Japan is bad, and the feeling towards us is good. This is inevitable. They absolutely do not sell foreign goods there (such as daily necessities are inclined to consumers), but they buy foreign goods such as machinery, because they can produce it. There is not much new news to tell about Russia recently, but Borodin runs an English newspaper in Moscow. Germany's recent great waves have attracted much attention. Papen has a long history in Germany. At the beginning of the European War, he was in Washington in charge of diplomacy and material liaison. The country was very powerful. Hitler courted him quite a bit when he came to power, but now he is excluding him and monitoring his actions. Hitler's methods can be said to be terrible.</p>
<h3>Predictions of War</h3>
<p>Although 1936 is said to be dangerous, war will not break out for a while, because Europeans and Americans are extremely averse to the psychology of war. The sound of cannons from the last war seems to still be in their ears. Japan also seems unable to lightly disregard the world's disapproval. However, crises are lurking everywhere, and I am afraid that the problem is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Yan also said that the China International Famine Relief Commission is doing very well in running credit cooperatives. The initial capital was only tens of thousands of yuan, but now the results are remarkable. The Shanghai Bank of Shanghai was the first to invest in the cooperative, and the Bank of China has also recently invested in it. The future development is immeasurable (5th).</p>
<h3>Fujian Province - Land and Water Blockade of Bandit Areas; Salt and Kerosene Sold Publicly According to Needed Quantities; Various Counties That Handled Poorly Have Been Corrected by the Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The bandit areas in Fujian Province are now only the four counties of Changting, Ninghua, Mingxi, and Qingliu, which are already surrounded by a large army. In order to cut off the bandit's supplies, the provincial government has implemented a blockade in the counties neighboring the bandit areas, established blockade offices, and also established patrol cards in waterways to investigate and crack down on smuggling. Public sales committees have been established in appropriate locations to sell salt and kerosene. The monthly quantity required for each district is determined according to the population of each district. Merchants are issued permits to come to the province to purchase oil and salt, which are transported to various districts for sale. The price is fixed at 14 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen (per hundred catties) for salt and 4 yuan and 8 jiao (per thirty-six catties) for kerosene. Freight and public expenses are included. However, recently, the provincial government and the security department have repeatedly received accusations from the people of Nanping, Shunchang, Guangze, Longxi, Longyan, and Yong'an counties against the county governments or public sales committees for issuing passports indiscriminately for profit and arbitrarily adding various surcharges. The authorities considered this inappropriate. Yesterday, the personnel handling the affairs of Nanping, Guangze, and Shunchang counties were all dismissed and sent to the province for investigation. Other counties that have handled affairs poorly, causing trouble for merchants and disturbing the people, have also been corrected or reprimanded separately. (June 30th)</p>
<h3>Northwest Inspection Notes by Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</h3>
<p>On the Road to Ninglan</p>
<p>From Ningxia to Lanzhou, there used to be automobiles available, but now there is no gasoline. They have been suspended for over a month. This reporter is eager to reach Lanzhou, so I specially asked a business to find a way to get gasoline and transferred the request to the Ningxia Provincial Road Management Office to sell tickets and run the car. They claimed, "This journey is over a thousand miles and requires about sixteen barrels of gasoline. Previously, three cars drove to Lanzhou and had no oil to return. Now, if you want to drive back and forth, the passengers must bear the cost of gasoline at 26 yuan per barrel, costing over 800 yuan for a round trip. There are not even ten people traveling together, so it is not economical." It is said that the usual one-way ticket price is only over 30 yuan, but now it exceeds twice that amount, and there is no gasoline to buy. Therefore, I discussed with my newly agreed travel companions Du Yutian, Xu Dengqing, and Luo Zhenzhong, and hired two sedan chairs at 90 yuan each, including porters, which could carry three people, luggage, and food.</p>
<p>On May 21st, at 7:00 AM, we departed from Ningxia. The sedan chairs left the South Gate and each paid a donation of 15 yuan. Looking at the porters' donation tickets, the listed hire price was 85 yuan. When asked, they said, "If the actual report is 90 yuan, the donation would be over 6 yuan." The porters also said, "In the past, even small vegetable and fruit vendors entering the city had to pay heavy donations. Later, when Old Mrs. Ma (referring to Ma Hongkui's mother) visited Zhongshan Park and found the price of fruits expensive, she asked about the donation and ordered it to be abolished immediately. The vendors were very grateful." Bai Shaofu saw us off to Wulibao Bridge and said, "If you encounter strong winds or heavy rain in the west, you must quickly stop at high ground to prevent flash floods and quicksand." Then he thanked us and shook hands in farewell. At Wangyuan Bridge, fifteen miles away, we rested briefly with tea. At Daguan Bridge, fifteen miles away, there were drawings of plows and rakes on the walls, or cakes and zongzi hanging on the doors, to indicate that the houses were selling those items. If a newborn baby was present, a red cloth would be hung on the door lintel, and those who saw it had to avoid it; otherwise, the owner would accuse them of bringing evil spirits and intentionally harming the baby. At Yanghe Fort, five miles away, the houses were densely packed. On the 1st, 4th, and 7th days of each lunar month, the villagers gathered here to trade. During "dajian" (mid-way tea and snacks), we heard the villagers discussing two shocking incidents of "grabbing soldiers," which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 19th), Wang Er from Wangtai Fort was suddenly brought here (Yanghe Fort) bound by a certain company commander, who entered his relative's house, saying he was looking for his brother Wang San, a "deserter." Later, he was not found, and the company commander was angry at his deception. Wang Er urgently requested to search elsewhere. As soon as he crossed the threshold, there was a loud bang, and his brain matter splattered as he fell dead on the ground. The company commander left angrily. The body has not yet been placed in a coffin. Also, three months ago, an old man from Zenggang Fort was also investigated by a certain unit because his son was a deserter. It was said that his son stole a gun worth 100 yuan, and hiring a replacement soldier would also cost 100 yuan. If the old man did not hand over the original person and gun, he would have to pay 200 yuan to settle the matter. The old man pleaded that his son had not actually returned or may have died in battle, and requested a delay in investigation. As he had no ability to pay, they severely beat him. His cries could be heard from afar. At the time, the Central First Division was stationed at Wanghong Fort to purchase grain from Zenggang Fort and happened to encounter the incident. They released the old man and tied up the investigator at the unit, who was then requested back by the Thirty-Fifth Division, saying that Ma Hongkui was known for his strict military discipline. For example, recently (the 18th), while on official business to Pingluo, some officers and soldiers of a certain company were forcibly purchasing civilian coal at low prices, intending to transport it to the city for high-price sales. The carts were closely spaced, and they failed to yield. Ma learned of the situation and immediately sent the officers (including a battalion commander) and soldiers to the military law office, where they were physically punished and sentenced to several years in prison. If he hears of any improper handling of "grabbing soldiers" here, he will undoubtedly impose appropriate sanctions.</p>
<p>Continuing forward, we saw over twenty empty ox carts coming towards us. We heard that they were to be used for military transport by a certain unit, and the drivers all frowned and looked worried. Passing Yangxing Fort, the fort was 2.8 zhang high, with a circumference of about 20 zhang, with gun emplacements and watchtowers for defense. The Yang family owned 300 mu of land, about two-tenths of which was planted with opium, and the rest with miscellaneous grains. On average, each mu of wheat could yield 5 dou, with 2 dou paid as tax and the remaining 3 dou worth 10 yuan. After deducting 2.3 yuan for Qingxiang (opium suppression) fees, 1 yuan for Qujiang dam materials, and about 1.7 yuan for miscellaneous expenses, the remaining 5 yuan was used to pay for seeds, fertilizer, and labor, which was far from sufficient. Farming was unprofitable and harmful. Top-grade land was sold for 30 yuan, but no one bought it. Planting opium was more profitable, but the costs were very high (the land had to be fertile, and the procedures were troublesome). If it unfortunately rained during the harvest, all the year's hard work would be in vain, which was also a great harm.</p>
<p>Along the way, there were both Hui and Han canals running side by side. The Hui Canal was lower than the Han Canal. The Hui Canal was on higher ground to the left, so they wanted to borrow water from the Han Canal. Therefore, they built a trough over the canal to connect them, called a "flying trough." Also, the Han Canal was considered too full, so they wanted to divert it to the Yellow River, passing through the Hui Canal. Therefore, they made a hole in the bottom of the canal to connect them, called a "dark tunnel." The canal ditches, troughs, and tunnels were interconnected horizontally and vertically. Wild forests and trees stretched endlessly as far as the eye could see. We arrived at Wanghong Fort and stayed overnight, covering a distance of 60 li. The fort had over 200 households, including 8 shops, and the rest were mostly farmers belonging to Ningshuo County. The county government was originally located in Ningxia City, with Dongxi Zheng Street as the boundary, with Ningxia to the north and Ningshuo to the south. In the 18th year of the Republic [1929], Ma Zhongying attacked Ningxia, and the county government initially moved to Mancheng (10 li from Ningxia). In the 20th year of the Republic [1931], it moved here (Wanghong Fort) and is currently under construction. After 42 days of continuous rain, the river rose and the canal leaked. The fort was low and wet. The county government moved two or three li south again, isolated in the fields. The land was purchased from the people at no more than 30 yuan per mu. The village and street boundaries have been clearly demarcated, covering an area of about 100 mu. The nearby merchants and residents have repeatedly been ordered to come and claim land to build houses, charging 55 yuan per mu to be used for fort construction. The merchants and residents refused, and they were threatened with heavy taxes. For over two years, no one has moved, probably because the merchants and residents are reluctant to leave their old homes and cannot afford to build new houses. When the county government purchased and surveyed the land, any hidden grain or tax-evading land was immediately discovered, and people were afraid of being punished, so they did not care about the land price, which the villagers called "two exemptions."</p>
<p>Recently, Song Ziwen came to Ningxia to inspect water conservancy at the dam, taking the main road through here. The county government, fearing that he would visit the Yellow River ferry, specially ordered the villagers to go to the ferry, regardless of cost, to build colorful sheds. Song did not visit, and the people resented the government. Also, hundreds of national flags, two or three feet long and wide, were made and distributed to the fort residents, ordering them to display them to welcome Song when he passed by. Each flag cost no more than 5 jiao, but later each household was charged 2 yuan for displaying it, and they could not return it, but could not afford to pay it, so there were complaints. The nearby soil and water were particularly fertile. Farmers had to pay 2.4 dou of grain tax per mu. Other Qingxiang fees and canal dam material fees were roughly the same as elsewhere. Next to the shop was the "official salt sales office." According to the person in charge, "People who eat salt must first obtain a license, divided into A, B, and C levels, detailing the name, address, number of people in the family, supervision price, salt weight, salt type, and how many days it will last. The weight of each ticket must not exceed 5 jin. Changes of name, location, and expiration are invalid. Private salt is fined more than 20 yuan per sheng, with 60% reported to the higher authorities and 40% kept by the office as a reward. The same applies to confiscated salt. The salt comes from Dingyuanying, Mongolia. When it was first established, some unscrupulous merchants bribed the inspectors, paying 5 yuan per horse per month to secretly transport and sell. If the inspector was going to Fort A, they would detour to Fort B, with both parties knowing in advance, and they never met by chance. Only those who bought it at a low price and resold it were easily discovered and severely punished without leniency. Now, smuggling and illegal sales have been repeatedly exposed, and no one dares to do it. However, the quality of the salt is mixed, and the weighing is insufficient, which is unavoidable in poor and remote areas."</p>
<h3>Hunan Province: Manufacturing Alcohol Automobiles</h3>
<p>The capital for starting an alcohol factory is 300,000 yuan, and alcohol automobiles are being manufactured to entertain the president of the Economics Society. A Changsha dispatch reports that Tan Changkai, during his tenure as Director of the Hunan Construction Department, successfully tested a gas automobile and held a grand exhibition, welcoming representatives from the central government and various provinces to Hunan to visit and ride in it. The results were very good. The Changtan section (from Changsha to Xiangtan, a distance of 90 li) of the highway is now exclusively used by gas automobiles. After Yu Ji inherited the position of Director of the Construction Department, he continued to research alcohol automobiles using alcohol as a substitute for gasoline, using his remaining time. He also hired Zhang Jixi, the director of the Guangxi Alcohol Factory, and Ms. He Xuekuan, a graduate of chemistry from Japan, to oversee the project. It has now been successfully researched and submitted to Governor He Jian for approval to start an alcohol factory on its own. Furthermore, because the annual meeting of the Chinese Economics Society is scheduled to be held in Changsha in August this year, when economists from across the country and important figures from the central government will come to Hunan, all political and construction projects in Hunan should be vigorously prepared and equipped to enhance the image. In particular, alcohol automobiles should be manufactured in advance to entertain and ride in, in order to showcase the achievements of Hunan's construction. The outline of the two planned projects for starting an alcohol factory and manufacturing alcohol automobiles is briefly described below:</p>
<p>(A) Alcohol Factory Establishment Plan: (1) The factory site is determined to be the Hongshantou Chong land outside the South Gate of Changsha, totaling 67 square mu and 45 square zhang, which will be purchased and used in accordance with the Land Acquisition Law. (2) The capital is set at 300,000 yuan, with 187,000 yuan as fixed capital for purchasing land, building factory buildings, and purchasing machinery, and 113,000 yuan as working capital. (3) Capital Raising Method: Originally, the Fourth Route Headquarters was responsible for raising 100,000 yuan, the Provincial Government for 100,000 yuan, and 100,000 yuan was to be raised from commercial shares. However, because Chairman Chiang Kai-shek believed that this measure could not only prevent leaks but was also related to national defense, he specially approved a subsidy of 100,000 yuan, so the raising of commercial shares was suspended. (4) Business Estimates: The annual output of alcohol is estimated at 346,000 English gallons, at a price of one yuan per gallon, totaling 346,000 yuan. In addition, the annual profit from alcohol residue is estimated at 2,000 yuan, for a total annual income of 348,000 yuan. On the expenditure side, the annual expenses for raw materials, wages, office, and depreciation total 250,000 yuan. After deducting expenses, the annual net profit is 98,000 yuan. (5) Currently, Zhang Jixi and He Xuekuan are responsible for preparations. Zhang will be the factory director and He will be the engineer in the future. Because new factory buildings need to be built, the factory can only officially open in January of next year at the earliest. Before the factory is officially established, all preparatory work will be carried out temporarily in the Industrial Testing Institute.</p>
<p>(B) Alcohol Automobile Manufacturing Plan: (1) Purchase four 1.5-ton truck chassis of 131 inches to be converted into alcohol automobiles using alcohol as a substitute for gasoline. (2) Expenses: The conversion cost is set at 16,000 yuan, and the equipment cost is 10,000 yuan, for a total of 26,000 yuan, to be allocated by the provincial treasury. (3) The annual meeting of the Chinese Economics Society is scheduled to be held in Hunan in late August, and the alcohol automobiles must be assembled before August 20th so that they can be used for transportation. It is said that after this matter is successful, all highways in Hunan Province will be able to exclusively use gas and alcohol automobiles, without the need for gasoline, which can reduce costs, prevent leaks, and develop local coal and wheat production to benefit the people. This is truly a well-considered plan. (July 4th)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province: Protecting Dikes and Preventing Floods; Provincial Government Must Order Strict Supervision by All Counties</h3>
<p>A Raozhou dispatch reports that since the middle of this month, the province has experienced continuous plum rains, and the Fuzhou and Gan rivers have experienced flash floods, with water levels rising sharply. The Fengshuwei dike in Nanchang County was also breached by the flood, and many nearby farmlands were flooded. Residents along the rivers upstream and downstream are worried about the possibility of a major flood and are all panicking. However, in recent days, the weather has cleared, and the water levels of the rivers and lakes have gradually receded, preventing a disaster. The Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau is still paying close attention to this matter. In addition to the dike repair projects in all counties along the rivers and lakes, which were completed by the end of April of this year, plans for preventing future floods have also been drafted. The cost budget and material estimates for flood prevention have been submitted to the Construction Department and forwarded to the Provincial Government for approval and implementation. The Provincial Government has also been instructed to purchase various materials in advance through the Materials Purchasing Committee to prepare for emergencies. At the same time, the dikes in each county are divided into six flood prevention zones, with one engineer or technician assigned to each zone to be responsible for patrolling and supervising the protection of each dike, and to issue flood prevention materials at any time to meet emergency needs. All counties are ordered to strictly supervise the implementation, and all dike managers are notified to prepare materials and assign laborers to patrol and guard day and night, without any negligence.

<h3>Jiangxi Provincial Security Office: Must Reorganize Security Teams; Establish an Inspection Committee</h3>
<p>A Nanchang dispatch reports that the Jiangxi Provincial Security Office believes that the Nationalist Army has repeatedly achieved victories in this campaign, and the collapse of the Red Bandits is expected in the near future. However, security matters in various places will be even more important in the future. Therefore, the Second Provincial Security Conference was held in the provincial capital last month, bringing together officials from security teams from all counties and districts in the province. Many resolutions were made regarding the reorganization of security teams throughout Jiangxi, and in accordance with the work plan outline for the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) compiled by the office, implementation began sequentially yesterday (the 31st). The matters being carried out these days are divided into three categories: (1) Unified Repair of Weapons: Security teams in each county have previously repaired weapons in disorganized and incomplete organizations, with each employing craftsmen to repair them, resulting in disorder and inconsistency, which is not the intention of reorganizing weapons. A circular has been issued to all district and county bureaus, limiting the revocation of county repair shops by the end of the month, and all weapons of security teams in each county and bureau will be uniformly repaired by the repair shops of the security command headquarters in each district. (2) Unified Emblems: The flags, seals, symbols, and armbands of security teams in each district and county bureaus were previously managed independently, with different sizes and styles, lacking the spirit of uniformity and violating the principle of unification. Recently, the flags, seals, symbols, and armbands of security teams in each district and county bureaus have been specially produced and began to be issued yesterday (the 1st). (3) Formation of Inspection Committee: During the reorganization of security teams throughout the province, it is necessary to inspect the number of officers and soldiers, the number of guns and ammunition, the number of uniforms, the quality of military police, military discipline, education status, internal and external comfort, and the construction of bunkers and fortifications in security teams in each district and county bureaus. Preparations are currently underway to organize an [Inspection Committee]. The members of this committee will be selected from the staff of each section and unit of the office, as well as inspection committee members, to depart for each district and county bureau for on-site inspection to clarify the situation. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>My Choice for District Chief Approved After District Merger: The autonomous area of this county was originally divided into sixteen districts. Previously, a circular was received from the provincial department ordering all counties to reorganize and merge to address the lack of talent and economic resources. County Magistrate Jin convened a meeting of district chiefs, and in accordance with the methods promulgated by the province, the districts were reduced to eight and district chief candidates were reselected and submitted to the province for approval. It has now been learned that the county government has received an order from the province approving the district chief candidates selected by the province: Li Zufugui of Songjiang District, Ye Li of Fengjing District, and Zhang Yande of Sijing District remain in their positions. Jiang Yi of Tinglin District, Yang Tianyi of Caojing District, Gu Junjie of Tianmashan District, and Chen Weiyu of Xinzhuang District will take over. It is said that the county government will soon issue notices.</p>
<h3>Joint Assembly of Nine-County Security Teams</h3>
<p>The security teams of this province have been ordered by the Provincial Security Office to conduct regional inspections. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has also sent Director Luo to various regions to inspect. This county has been designated as the inspection site for nine counties including Songjiang, and preparations should be made in advance. Therefore, a conference on the inspection of nine counties was convened the day before yesterday. Attending were Wang Wen and Yang Weisheng from Fengxian, Yang Zhengding from Baoshan, Li Qiang from Qingpu, Chen Peng from Nanhui, Yang Jinbao from Shanghai, Xu Jihui from Jiading, Kang Gonghe from Chuansha, Zhao Zanchen from Jinshan, Jin Tigan from Songjiang, Chen Junsong (representing Songjiang), Xu Xienong from Songzhong, and Cheng Chuzhuang, who chaired the meeting. The following matters were discussed: (1) The number of participants from each county was decided as follows: Jinshan, two companies, nine men per squad, totaling 162 men; Fengxian, two companies, ten men per squad, totaling 190 men; Nanhui, one company, twelve men per squad, totaling 117 men; Chuansha, one detachment, nine men per squad, totaling 36 men; Shanghai, one detachment, nine men per squad, totaling 50 officers and soldiers; Baoshan County, approximately 60 men; Jiading, one detachment, thirteen men per squad, totaling 39 men; Qingpu, one company, nine men per squad, totaling 81 men; Songjiang, one company, nine men per squad, totaling 81 men; Songzhong, two military training classes, approximately 70 men. (2) It was decided that the participants would arrive in Songjiang two days before the inspection to concentrate on rehearsals. Zhao, deputy leader of Jinshan, was appointed as the chief commander, and Cheng, deputy commander of Songjiang, was appointed. The inspection report, single inspection etiquette, and inspection reception expenses were decided, totaling approximately 300-400 yuan, which should be handled by the convening county.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Drought Disaster in Coastal Districts Has Already Formed: Since entering summer, the weather has been extremely hot with no rain, causing rivers in various parts of the county to dry up and a severe shortage of irrigation water. The western half of the county can temporarily maintain the current situation due to deeper rivers, but if it does not rain within the next week, a water shortage panic will also occur. The cotton seedlings planted early in the drought are still in good condition, but the late plantings are showing signs of wilting and are eagerly awaiting rain. In the eastern half of the county, the rivers in the coastal districts were originally very shallow, and now there is no water to draw, so most of the paddy fields have been abandoned, and most of the cotton seedlings have withered, especially in the villages of the 1st, 2nd, and 8th districts, where the disaster is already evident, and the farmers are extremely panicked. Yesterday, the county government issued a circular to chambers of commerce, district offices, etc., ordering the people to immediately stop banquets and slaughtering and pray for rain.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Dredging the Lujiang River Channel</h3>
<p>The Lujiang River Channel in the Fourth District is an important passage to the lake in the southwest of our county, and the hundreds of li of farmland upstream rely on it for irrigation. Unexpectedly, the channel mouth has become silted and shallow due to the extreme drought this summer, and it is about to dry up. Therefore, Wu Zhenqing, the head of Lujiang Township, and others, tried to find a way to dredge it, but the project was huge and difficult to start. They submitted a request to the district office, which forwarded it to the county construction bureau for handling. The construction bureau sent technician Xu Fuli to the countryside to survey, and the survey has been completed. Yesterday, more than 200 workers were hired to start dredging, and the project is scheduled to be completed by the 15th of this month. The county government, fearing that ignorant villagers would take the opportunity to obstruct the project, also issued a notice yesterday to facilitate the progress. Small boats traveling through the river should reduce their load when the water is shallow to avoid obstruction and facilitate travel. As for yesterday's weather, it was slightly cooler, and rice prices also rebounded slightly.</p>
<h3>Expansion of the Security Team Murder Case</h3>
<p>On the 16th of last month, a bizarre murder case occurred in the Second Squad of the Second Company of the Security Team in Shangshan Village, Anzhen, Eighth District. Han Zike, a member of the team, was shot and killed on the spot, and another team member, Han Weibiao, was also shot and injured. He died after medical treatment proved ineffective. After an examination by the prosecutor, it was determined that Han Zike committed suicide and Han Weibiao was shot and killed. This has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Sun Wenyu and Wu Maoxun, two friends of Han Zike, believe that the cause of Zike's death is bizarre and that there are many doubts, and that it was definitely not suicide. They suspect that Zhu Meiji and Zhu Xiangping, the leaders of the security team's squad, were involved in a premeditated plot. Therefore, yesterday they specially submitted a report to the executive and supervisory committees of the county party headquarters, requesting them to forward letters to the local branch court and the security office to summon witnesses and arrest the murderers for interrogation. The original report lists several points of suspicion: (1) After the incident, when Zhu Xiangping rode a horse to report to the public security branch, there were more than twenty blood stains on his body. (2) The deceased had two gunshot wounds to the chest, one from close range and one from long range, indicating that it was not suicide. (3) There was no bullet trajectory in the deceased's bed curtains, and none could be found after a thorough search. However, when the bodies were re-examined the next day, it was suddenly reported that there were two triangular holes with fluff in the curtains, which were obviously patched up after the fact with scissors or other objects. Moreover, Han Zike had been dismissed and was already wearing civilian clothes at the time of his death, so how could he have a pistol as a means of suicide? (4) How could a suicide victim fire the gun twice, and after shooting himself, calmly put on his shoes, get out of bed, and lie down peacefully with his head on the pillow? There was also no mess on the bedding. This was clearly a case of moving the body after being shot. (5) The report of squad leader Zhu Meiji and his confession to the prosecutor are contradictory, and the prosecutor did not pay attention to the above points of suspicion during the examination, which is very sloppy and provides the murderer with considerable convenience to destroy evidence.</p>
<h3>Two-Headed Snake Bites Cook</h3>
<p>Huang Baoquan, a resident of Tao Dianqiao, Figure 582, Jingyun City, Second District, is 34 years old. He has a few acres of thin land at home and can make a living by spring plowing and summer weeding. Baoquan is currently working as a cook in a middle school in Suzhou. Taking advantage of this summer vacation, he returned home to visit his relatives. At around 6:00 PM the night before last, while Baoquan was working in the field helping with a water-pumping boat, he discovered a poisonous snake on the edge of the field. The snake was about two feet long, had two heads on one end, a white body like silver, shiny scales, protruding tongues, and scarlet red eyes. Its lower body was coiled up and bit Baoquan's right foot, the small fatty part, twice [both heads bit people at the same time], and fresh blood flowed straight down. He fainted immediately and fell to the ground beside the field. Later, his wife, Zhu, ordered people to carry him home, but his whole body was swollen, and his skin had turned bluish-gray. The poison was too deep, and his life was in danger.</p>
<h3>Septuagenarian Dies of Heatstroke</h3>
<p>The weather has been extremely hot in recent days, with the temperature in the rooms reaching over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. There have been frequent reports of people dying of heatstroke. The day before yesterday (the 3rd) afternoon, Xu Zhifa, a villager from Chichuan Township, Fourth District, who was over 70 years old, went to Sanhe Township on business. He succumbed to the heat on the way, fainted, and fell to the ground. When his family heard the news, they rushed to rescue him, but to no avail, and he soon died.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Hurricane Causes Disaster in Shazhou</h3>
<p>In Shazhou, a hurricane struck during a rainstorm mixed with hail in Hengchuan Port, Dongwangzhongwei, on the afternoon of the 3rd. The thatched houses of the people in the weirs from Toutou to Ersanwei and Shenjiawei, totaling over 150 households and over 200 rooms, were all blown down, and a solid wooden bridge was also blown away. The hail was as big as chicken eggs, but fortunately, the damage to crops was small. During the thunderstorm, Li Ayun, a farmer in Dujia Lane, Zhanwen Bridge, was struck and killed by lightning while farming in the field.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Public Memorial for Two National Heroes</h3>
<p>During the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, Japanese pirates repeatedly invaded this county. Wang Tie happened to be the county magistrate at the time, and he led the officers and soldiers to resist the pirates to the death. Because of the disparity in numbers, he and Counselor Qian Ban died in battle here. Later generations built the Shuangzhong Temple in memory of their loyalty and martyrdom. By now, the temple was dilapidated. The party and government authorities, in memory of the national anti-Japanese heroes, allocated funds from the Education Department to repair the temple, which has been completely renovated. July 5th was the anniversary of the martyrdom of the two heroes, Wang and Qian. The county party headquarters, together with the county government and the Education Bureau, held a memorial service for the two loyal heroes, with Wu Zhongying, the party committee member, and Zhou Heng, the county magistrate, presiding over the ceremony. They recounted the martyrdom of the two heroes 380 years ago.</p>
<h3>New Public Security Bureau Chief Takes Office</h3>
<p>Shen Gaozhen, a member of the Provincial Committee, was transferred to be the director of the Public Security Bureau of this county. Because Shen was unwilling to take office, he resigned to the province without taking over. Zhou Ding, the director of the Public Security Bureau of Songjiang County, was transferred by the Provincial Department to take the position. Zhou arrived in Changshu on the 4th and officially took over on the morning of the 5th, and attended the county government meeting. Lu Baozhong, the original inspector general, and Dai Zongzhong, the inspector, have been dismissed, and Tong Shuyong has been appointed as the section chief. It is reported that Zhou was instructed by the province to rectify the past abuses of the Public Security Bureau in Changshu. It is expected that there will be major changes in the staff.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Riverbank Collapse Becomes More Severe</h3>
<p>The collapse of the riverbank in Nantong is severe, and the original stone dike has almost completely sunk. Recently, the encroachment of the Yangtze River tide has become more and more severe, and Langshan Mountain will soon enter the river. Zheng Yitong, the commissioner of the Nantong District, has specially requested relief from the Construction Department on behalf of the local area. It is said that Director Shen Baixian will come to Tong to investigate in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Fire in Xiaoxiao River, Hushu</h3>
<p>At 5:20 PM yesterday, a fire broke out in the home of Wang Tianhu, No. 1 Datielong Lane, Xiaoxiao River, Hushu, Hangzhou, due to careless cooking. In an instant, the fire blazed into the sky, and nothing could be salvaged. Fortunately, Tang Jinzhai, the captain of the fire brigade, drove a pumper and other vehicles one after another and rushed to the scene to put out the fire with all their might. Due to the dry weather, it was not easy to extinguish, and the fire was extinguished after an hour. Nineteen houses were burned down, with total losses estimated at 60,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Two Car Accidents in One Day</h3>
<p>On the Binjiang Road of the New Market, yesterday (the 5th) at 6 PM, a No. 7 cargo truck belonging to the Hongfei Company was passing through when Jin Guoguang, a sergeant of the Transportation Corps of the Ministry of Military Affairs, attempted to cross the road from Binjiang to a hotel on the opposite side. The driver, Wang Yinhua, was unable to avoid him, and Jin was knocked down and his head and chest were crushed. The injuries were extremely severe and he was bleeding profusely. The police detained the driver and the truck, and immediately hired a vehicle to transport the injured man to the hospital for treatment. He died at 8:30 PM. Today (the 6th), a telegram was sent to the Hangzhou District Court, which dispatched an official to examine the body before it was placed in a coffin. Also, at 3 PM yesterday, a No. 1041 small chartered car from the Modern Automobile Company on Pinghai Road, when passing the Yanling corner, hit a man named Liu Chaofu, over 50 years old, who lived in the Baijingfang Lane.

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>The Chinese Paper Mill Association Petitions to Maintain the Original Import Tax on Foreign Paper; Representatives Liu Shusen and Others Go to Beijing to Petition the Authorities</h3>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Chinese Paper Mill Association, considering that the new Shanghai Customs tariff rate for foreign paper No. 556 is significantly lower than before, has specially dispatched representatives Liu Shusen and others to bring a petition to Beijing, separately appealing to the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Customs Administration to maintain the paper import tariff rate issued in May of last year, not to reduce or lighten it, and to continue collecting it so that Chinese paper manufacturing can barely survive. The original letter is recorded below: (omission above) The government recently revised the tariff rate, greatly reducing the rate for paper No. 556 in the original tariff schedule, which is extremely alarming. This matter is of great importance to the survival of our Chinese paper mills. It is found that No. 556 paper includes improved Lian Shi paper, Daolin paper, molded paper, etc. Those who request a reduction in the tax rate have two arguments. One is that since the tax increase, the products of various paper mills are still mostly the traditional Lian Shi paper of our country. In addition, the output of Daolin and other types of paper has not increased, but only makes consumers bear a heavier burden, etc. This is actually a superficial argument. Taking the improved Lian Shi paper as an example, since the tax increase, there has been no more dumping of imported foreign paper. This is a clear effect of adopting a protectionist trade policy. Moreover, the tariff schedule was promulgated in May and August of last year, and was finalized after review and approval by the Legislative Yuan. The factories of the association are all making efforts to add equipment and proceed. After one year, supply and demand should be balanced. If it is suddenly reduced now, it seems to be intentionally deceiving merchants, that is, encouraging them to plant but not allowing them to harvest, so that all factories must close down immediately, because China's finances are so difficult and the paper industry is so immature. To make it a reality within one year is inherently impossible and should not be sought by this means. The second is that it is said that in order to support education and culture, the Daolin paper required should be reduced in tax, etc. This is especially a decorative statement, because Daolin and other papers are actually a minority in cultural needs. After the tax reduction, only goods close to luxury consumption will be lightly taxed, while the important paper industry will be secretly destroyed. It is found that primary school textbooks and newspapers all use printing paper, and Daolin paper is used for books above middle school. The annual national consumption is only 40,000 to 50,000 dan, accounting for 20% of the import amount. The remaining 80% is mainly supplied to color printing trademarks for decoration. For the sake of beauty, the printing cost is often several times the price of the paper itself, even if a heavier tax is imposed, it is not excessive. How can we not consider the survival of domestic paper mills, and as a result, unknowingly, create a frenzy of foreign paper sales, is it a fair thing? It is also found that the cost of printing books with Daolin paper in various bookstores accounts for only one-tenth of the fixed price. According to the current tax rate, a book worth one yuan will only increase by three or four cents of national currency after the tax increase, accounting for only 3-4%, which is very small. There is no major loss for both buyers and sellers. This can be proved by facts. (omission in the middle) Therefore, the original tax rate does not harm the interests of bookstores and printing industries. Chinese factories can only hope to gain a foothold and compete with foreign paper. If the tax on foreign paper is reduced, the two industries will profit even more. (omission in the middle) As a result, foreign paper will become more active, and Chinese factories will no longer be able to compete with foreign merchants, and there will never be a day of self-sufficiency. The so-called purpose of supporting culture and education will be achieved, but the supply of its necessities will be entirely controlled by foreign merchants in the concessions, and it will be formed unconsciously. Thinking of this, how can we not feel ashamed and sad? This is what the association especially believes is unacceptable. Furthermore, the China Bank's 1933 annual report lists international income and expenditure in detail. The import surplus is over 800 million, and the export of raw gold and silver is over 200 million. There is also an unverifiable source of about 300 million yuan, totaling 500 million yuan. How much cash does our country have? If this situation continues for several years, how can the people not go bankrupt? The way to save it is to increase import tariffs, there is really no other way, because increasing production and improving products cannot be done without financial support. If you want to get loans and raise shares, unless the business has the possibility of surplus, who would invest? This is the principle of economics. Last year, there was a promulgation of revised tariff regulations, and there was also an order from the Ministry of Education to bookstores and printing houses to use domestic paper, and the government's policy of saving the country is based on developing national productivity to enrich national strength. The paper mills of the association deeply feel the government's care, so even in difficult and difficult times, they are still actively advancing, raising funds to add machines, increase production, compete externally, and strive to survive.

<h3>Rong Zongjing to Temporarily Leave Shanghai for Recuperation Due to Old Age and Illness; Wang Yuqing to Act as General Manager of the Factory; Internal Changes, Reorganization are Untrue</h3>
<p>The Datong News Agency reports that yesterday a certain newspaper reported that Rong Zongjing, a magnate in the Chinese flour and cotton yarn industries, has a passive attitude and may reorganize Fuxin and Shenxin factories. The Datong News Agency reporter, because this matter is of great importance, specially visited Rong Zongjing and relevant parties to inquire about the details, which are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Reports of Reorganization Not Credible</h3>
<p>The reporter first went to the Shenxin Textile General Company on Jiangxi Road yesterday morning to interview Rong Zongjing, showed him the newspaper report, and asked for the truth. Rong denied the reorganization of Fuxin and Shenxin, and said that the impact of the economic downturn on the industrial sector is not unique to China, and not only Fuxin and Shenxin. Each Fuxin factory produces about 100,000 bags of flour per day, and each Shenxin factory has 500,000 to 600,000 yarn spindles. The two parties employ about 20,000 to 30,000 workers. If they are reorganized, the foundation will be shaken, and the impact on the country and society can be imagined. Moreover, the total capital of Fuxin, Shenxin, etc. reaches 100 million yuan. It is feared that any bank in Shanghai will not be able to raise such a huge amount of money at one time. This proves that the newspaper reports are not credible.</p>
<h3>Suffering from Diabetes, Moving to Recuperate</h3>
<p>Rong continued, "I have been working in industry for decades, painstakingly managing it, and my mind and energy have been exhausted. As I get older, my energy is getting weaker, resulting in neurasthenia and blurred vision. I now suffer from diabetes and go to the Public Works Bureau Hospital for examination every day. The results of the examination a few days ago showed that the sugar content in the urine reached five or six CC, and the condition was quite dangerous. Although it has been reduced to three CC, according to the doctor, it is because of less food intake. The condition has not been greatly reduced, and I have been told to eliminate all affairs, rest in peace, and change places for treatment to be effective. Mr. Shi Liangcai and others also advised me to move to recuperate, so I plan to go to Moganshan in the near future and return to Wuxi for a long period of recuperation. However, the weather has been extremely hot these days, and there are many inconveniences for travel. I plan to wait for the temperature to drop below 90 degrees before starting the journey."</p>
<h3>Wang Acting as General Manager After His Departure</h3>
<p>"As for the position of General Manager after my departure from Shanghai, I will ask Wang Yuqing to act as the acting manager first. Mr. Wang is an old partner who opened the factory for me. We have been together for twenty or thirty years. He was originally the manager of this factory, is smart and capable, and is extremely familiar with the affairs of each factory. He is competent to handle the position of General Manager. Outsiders do not understand the truth and rumors of reorganization arise. The newspaper report must be based on this misunderstanding."</p>
<h3>Internal Factory Affairs Are Not Related</h3>
<p>The reporter then visited someone close to Rong. According to him, Rong's resignation from the post of general manager is true, but although Fuxin and other factories were founded by Rong, they are also companies. Now Rong is getting older and his energy cannot keep up, so he specifically resigned from some positions and took the opportunity to retire, but he did not immediately leave, so there is no major relationship with the internal affairs of the factory, etc.</p>
<h3>After the Implementation of the New Tariff, a Large Number of Japanese Goods Poured In; National Products May Be Knocked Down</h3>
<p>The Damei Evening News reports that since the new tariff was implemented on July 1, the import of Japanese goods into China has increased sharply, especially in Shanghai. The first Japanese cargo ship to Shanghai brought cotton products, sugar, beer, enamelware, etc., totaling 3,200 tons, because the tariff rate has been reduced, and there are profits to be made. The transportation business of Osaka Shosen Kaisha, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, and Nippon Yusen Kaisha has been sluggish for a long time, but now they have become active. The Japanese commercial counselor in Shanghai declared that the trade has become a new record in the past four days. Chinese merchants have ordered more than 2,000 tons of Japanese seafood and paper, and Chinese merchants ordered 2,000 bags of Japanese sugar on July 2. Japanese merchants expect that due to the reduction in the tariff rate of Japanese goods, the export of Japanese loans to China this month will continue to increase.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Party Headquarters Prepares to Commemorate the Northern Expedition Pledge; Committee Member Tao Baichuan Elected Chairman of the Assembly</h3>
<p>This month, July 9, is the anniversary of the Commander-in-Chief Chiang of the National Revolutionary Army's pledge to the Northern Expedition. The Municipal Party Headquarters, in accordance with the central government's regulations on commemorative days, is actively preparing for a commemorative assembly. The executive committee has elected Committee Member Tao Baichuan as the chairman of the assembly, which is scheduled to be held at 9 AM on the morning of the 9th in the auditorium of the headquarters. The whole city will hang flags to celebrate, and all agencies, groups, schools, and party headquarters will take a day off to show their commemoration. The resolutions of the headquarters on the commemorative activities are recorded below: (1) Convene the Shanghai Municipal All-Sector National Revolutionary Army Pledge Eighth Anniversary Commemorative Assembly; (2) Location: Municipal Party Headquarters; (3) Date: July 9, 9 AM; (4) One chairman of the assembly, to be served by a member of the Municipal Party Headquarters; (5) Publish in the newspaper on July 8 for one day, informing all sectors that they will take a day off on this day, hang flags to celebrate, and send representatives to participate in the assembly; (6) Notify the district party headquarters to instruct their subordinates to earnestly publicize in accordance with the central government's issued propaganda outline, and report the progress of the work for verification; (7) Issue a letter to the public commemorating the eighth anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's pledge to the Northern Expedition.</p>
<h3>Today is the Anniversary of the Establishment of the Municipal Government; the Municipal Government and its Affiliates Will Take a Day Off; the 9th is the Anniversary of the Pledge and Will Also Take a Day Off</h3>
<p>Today (the 7th) is the ninth anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Yesterday, the Municipal Government authorities instructed all bureaus to take a day off and hold a commemorative ceremony in the auditorium of the Municipal Government at 9 AM. At that time, the mayor and all affiliated agencies will personally participate. It is also learned that July 9, the anniversary of the National Revolutionary Army's Pledge, will also be a day off.</p>
<h3>The Lawyers Association Sends Telegrams to the Ministry of Law and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Requesting Negotiations with the Concession Authorities to Hand Over Lang Tan for Legal Interrogation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association telegraphed the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs two days ago: Nanjing Ministry of Judicial Administration and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Shanghai First Special District Local Court accepted the case of Cai Yangqi and his wife from Chongming, who sued Lang Zuyin, a detective of the Laozha Patrol of the Shanghai Public Concession, for using electric torture privately, resulting in disability. Lang Zuyin was summoned five times to appear in court for questioning, but he refused to appear, and the patrol refused to return the subpoena without reason, preventing the court from exercising its powers. The reason why the Public Works Bureau patrol did not order Lang Zuyin to appear for questioning and returned the subpoena was that the defendant was questioned and subjected to electric torture. In May last year, Luo Sizhang and Lu Yong were arrested by the Public Works Bureau patrol for excuses and subjected to electric torture many times. After being released, they reported to the association, and the association learned about the torture and sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government for negotiation. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau patrol clearly had no doubt about the defendant's use of electric torture and should be summoned according to law to investigate the facts.</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau patrol has repeatedly refused to accept subpoenas, especially despising legal rights and undermining the agreement, which cannot be denied. For this reason, we telegraph to your department, consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and promptly negotiate with the concession authorities, ordering them to abide by the agreement and immediately hand over Lang Zuyin for questioning by the court, and guaranteeing that there will be no more such unfortunate events and private use of electric torture in the future, in order to protect national rights and maintain human dignity. Shanghai Lawyers Association respectfully submits.</p>

<p>Gu Weijun, the Chinese Minister to France, Wang Chonghui, a judge of the Hague Court, and Hu Shize, the Minister to Switzerland, returned to China on the Italian ship Ganqi. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday via Hong Kong. Except for Wang, who returned to his native Guangdong after arriving in Hong Kong yesterday and will not come to Shanghai for the time being, Gu and Hu will arrive here at about 12 PM this afternoon, accompanied by Wei Daoming, the former Minister of Judicial Administration, and Wu Liande, the Director of the National Seaport Quarantine Office.

If you agree to participate, please send a reply letter with a fee of ten yuan, along with the names and addresses of three representatives, so that after the date is set, the invitation will be sent.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai Resigns Again from the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, the former chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, was elected as a supervisory committee member after his term expired. Wang immediately sent a letter requesting his resignation, citing years of service and exhaustion. After discussion and decision by the Executive Supervisory Committee, they unanimously and earnestly retained him and issued a letter. Wang then sent another letter to the association, still requesting his resignation. The letter said, "In reply, I am truly sincere, but I only seek to maintain the legislative spirit of not being eligible for re-election. I dare not let you know my sincerity, and there is no other deep intention. I hope you can understand me, and I am grateful. To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<h3>Approval of the Ministry of Justice</h3>
<p>It is known that since the Minister took office, he has been determined to rectify the judiciary. Shanghai is a place of attention both at home and abroad. The Minister is especially cautious about the employment and administration of the Special District Court. If the association has any opinions, it should point out all the aspects that should be promoted and reformed to supplement what the Minister cannot see or hear. The Minister is willing to hear it. However, the incoming presentation is mostly implicit and cannot be used as a basis for rectification. You should submit a responsible and concrete fact to the department for verification. This is what I hope.</p>
<h3>Telegram of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Nanjing Ministry of Justice Minister Luo</p>
<p>I have just received the approval of the 1232th, encouraging me to point out all the aspects that should be promoted and reformed. I see that you are open to hearing and free from stereotypes. I am deeply impressed. I believe that the atmosphere in the political circles is the most rigorous in the judiciary. The changes in the political situation have slightly broken the rules, and you should have understood it early. The changes in the atmosphere are all due to the careful operation of the authorities, which cannot be sought by traces. The minister accuses me of being mostly implicit, and the association has no excuse to explain. As for the issues of promotion and reform, they belong to the internal system, and I dare not talk about it as an outsider. However, the prevailing use of torture in the patrol and the cruelty of the methods are unanimously believed that in China, where torture has been abolished long ago, the concessions should not be allowed to retain this deformed method. We must do our best to abolish it. Since you have listened to it clearly, I dare to offer my foolishness. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Shipowners Request the Establishment of a Maritime Affairs Inquiry Office to Handle Shipping Disputes</h3>
<p>The organization of the Maritime Court has been decided by the Executive Yuan and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for drafting the organizational law. After the formal promulgation, it can be started. The Shanghai shipowners, in order to value the beginning of the Legislative Yuan drafting the organizational law, must consult widely and consider all aspects, put forward opinions, and publicly recommend Wei Wenhan, a lawyer and legal advisor of the Municipal Shipping Association, to represent the shipowners to go to Beijing to state everything to the Ministry of Communications, the Executive Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan for reference. Mr. Wei had satisfactory negotiations in Beijing and has returned to Shanghai to report to the shipowners.</p>
<p>The opinions put forward by the Shanghai shipowners this time are to request the government to allow the organization of a maritime affairs inquiry office. The reason for its establishment is to draw lessons from the disputes that have occurred in the shipping industry in recent years. For all matters such as ship collisions, although the Maritime Affairs Bureau has a collision dispute committee, it is limited to a part of the collision. When the collision committee was not established, all cases were reported to the local customs for handling. Today, all countries in the world have maritime courts specializing in handling shipping disputes. Before our country's maritime court is organized, a maritime affairs inquiry office should be set up first, which is to be added to the port office of the Maritime Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. The organization of the inquiry office is to be joined by one person with nautical knowledge from the local customs and the Maritime Affairs Bureau, and one judge appointed by the court. Its duties are to specialize in various disputes such as ship collisions, groundings, and other incidents. First, the inquiry office sends personnel to verify the truth, and then the inquiry office mediates fairly based on the facts. If the mediation is ineffective, the case is adjudicated by the Maritime Court. If there is an accident, the captain or the agent captain and other responsible crew members of each merchant ship must report in detail within 48 hours for investigation. If anyone disobeys and does not report, the local maritime affairs bureau will punish the person in charge of the ship. This method has been drafted into articles and submitted to the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<h3>Successive Commencement of Work at Five Silk Factories in Zhabei; Only One-Quarter of Workers Expected to Find Employment</h3>
<p>Zhabei originally had more than 30 silk factories of various sizes. Last year, due to the high price of cocoons and the falling price of silk, all of them closed down, causing more than 30,000 male and female factory workers to lose their jobs. Now that the new silk season has arrived, the general male and female factory workers all hope to find work to make a living. However, according to industry insiders yesterday, this year's silk prices are affected by the improvement of sericulture in a certain country. The price of silk is only 450-460 yuan per dan (i.e., 100 catties). The purchase price of dry cocoons is about 90 yuan per dan. Four and a half dan of high-quality cocoons can produce one dan of silk, while low-quality cocoons require five dan to produce one dan of silk. In addition to labor costs, it will definitely result in losses. Therefore, although a small number of factories have started work, they are all temporary in nature. An investigation found that five factories have recently started work one after another, including Zhaofeng on Hutai Road, east of Pengpu New Bridge (formerly Fuchang), with 416 silk looms; Fengtai at Pingjiang Bridge, with the same number of looms; Maoli at Tanjiaqiao; Meisheng; Xingyuanlong in Pengpu Town (commonly known as Miaotou), etc. Each factory has more than 400 silk looms, or 200 plus looms, capable of employing about 4,500 male and female workers. Together with Yuchang on Meiyuan Road and Liji in Changanli on Changan Road, they can accommodate about 6,700 male and female workers. More than three-quarters of the poor men and women are still unemployed. If silk prices fall again in the future, the future is unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Ban on Ship Officers Performing Duties Beyond Their Rank Postponed to End of Year; Ship Officer Examination Committee Abolished; Affairs Merged into the Navigation Affairs Department</h3>
<p>The Chinese Marine Engineers Association, because the Ministry of Communications previously issued an order to ban lower-level ship officers from holding senior positions, petitioned for a change in the method. Yesterday, an official reply was received, which stated: "A case has been received regarding a petition for another method to provide relief to marine engineers who have already held higher-level positions. It has been learned that regarding the ban on lower-level ship officers holding higher-level positions, the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association has stated the difficulties involved and requested permission to make flexible arrangements. Permission has been granted to extend the ban deadline to the end of this year. You must be informed of this order." In addition, the ministry has extended the examination period for various ship officers to the end of this year, and the Ship Officer Examination Committee has been abolished. All committee affairs will be handled by the Navigation Affairs Department, and the organizational charter will be abolished at the same time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate Arrests Japanese and Korean Robbers; Sadaji Kitatsuji Was Previously Punished for Setting Fire to the Sanyou Company; Irie and Others Are All Related to the Zhapu Road Incident</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun yesterday, the Japanese Consulate Police, on the night of the 5th, secretly deployed a very strict cordon and arrested the vicious criminals Yu-dong Jin, Sadaji Kitatsuji, Kunitsugu Kimoto, Jiro Irie, Mitsuyoshi Kitamura, Tetsu Nishida, and six others. Jin Yu-dong is a Korean who committed robbery and injury two years ago, was escorted to Nagasaki, and sentenced to six months in prison. Sadaji Kitatsuji set fire to the Sanyou Industrial Company before the Shanghai Incident and was sentenced to one year in prison for arson. Jiro Irie, Mitsuyoshi Kitamura, Tetsu Nishida, and others conspired to threaten and intimidate, or forcibly seize gold and goods, or acted as police officers from the Changchong Police Station, hiding on the roadside and robbing property. A few days ago, a company employee was robbed of 180 yuan in cash and a watch. On the night of the 4th, they broke into the home of a prostitute and attempted to rob her, but failed. Moreover, they are also related to the Zhapu Road incident. The consulate police have long been racking their brains to deal with such violent elements, and it was not until the night of the 5th that the entire gang was arrested.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Union Membership Registration Extended to the End of September; Shanghai Branch to be Officially Established in January Next Year</h3>
<p>The preparatory committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, after changing its system, has not yet completed the procedures for seamen's registration by local branches. Therefore, it has been decided to extend the deadline for registration by three months, to the end of September. It is now heard that the establishment of a formal union will have to wait until all the work is completed before it can be held. The Shanghai branch has decided to organize the various ship branches from September to December. Therefore, the establishment of a formal union will have to be postponed to January next year.</p>

<h3>Aviation to Save the Nation; Walking Propaganda Group Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The China National Promotion of Aviation to Save the Nation Walking Propaganda Group, led by团长陈正龙, has arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. The following is a record of its declaration: "We, the China National Promotion of Aviation to Save the Nation Walking Propaganda Group, have now walked to your place. Each of our members went to the Northeast after the September 18th Incident and fought hand-to-hand with the violent Japanese for two years. The battles we went through include more than a hundred large and small battles in Liaodong, Jinzhou, Chaoyang, Qinghe, Yixian, Lingyuan, Jianping, Liuhe, Wenlu, and Pingquan. Until the Tanggu Truce, we reluctantly disarmed and returned to our fields with tears. After healing our wounds, we organized the current Promotion of Aviation to Save the Nation Walking Propaganda Group. The purpose of our group is to follow the teachings of 光总理 and realize the Three Principles of the People, awaken our compatriots, unite our efforts, and strive for aviation construction to achieve the foundation of strengthening national defense and reviving the nation. The organization of our group has been approved and registered by the Central Propaganda Committee and ordered to be guided by the party headquarters in the places it arrives. This is a greeting gift we bring to introduce ourselves, and it is also our earnest hope that compatriots from all walks of life will guide and recognize us. However, China needs aviation construction because some weapons are relics of the previous century and cannot compete with the new weapons of the present century. The recent increase in the ratio and number of aircraft in countries such as the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany, and Japan is even more alarming. As for China's international position in the Far East, since the outbreak of September 18th, the loss of four provinces has further reduced the degree of its international position. If China is not prepared to deal with the Second World War in 1936, then all the Far East's international position will be reduced to the point of non-existence, following in the footsteps of Korea and India in becoming slaves to the great powers. This is a tragedy that will soon unfold, and it is also a major reason why our group is walking to your place to shout to our compatriots to save the country through aviation! Come! Come! Come! Compatriots, quickly scoop up your own pockets and donate money to the government or local areas to buy airplanes and manufacture airplanes, to make the old and weak nation of China young and vibrant! Only by preparing new weapons and strengthening our national defense can we defend ourselves and others. Not only can the country be saved, but also the homes of our compatriots can be protected!"</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association Clearly Calls for General Membership Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association, in order to comply with the order to revise the association's constitution and restore the pre-Republic of China Year 16 system of presidents and councilors, has convened temporary general membership meetings five times, but all of them have been declared invalid due to insufficient attendance, resulting in a delay of half a year. The association has rescheduled the temporary general membership meeting for 2:00 p.m. this Sunday (i.e., tomorrow), August 8th, at the Hushe located at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road. The association has been organizing the proposed motions for several days. The recent new cases that should be included in the discussion include the selection of representatives for the National Lawyers Association this year's Representative Assembly, and the proposal put forward by the members that the number of executive and supervisory committee members in the association's constitution should be increased due to the increase in the number of current members. These proposals are currently being printed and will be distributed to the members attending the meeting for reference and discussion.</p>
<h3>Anhui Native Place Groups Discuss the Issue of Dividing Wuyuan and Returning it to Jiangxi; Representatives Recommended to go to Beijing to Request Exemption from Division</h3>
<p>The Anhui Shanghai Native Place Association, the Huining Shanghai Native Place Association, the Huining School, and the Wuyuan Shanghai Native Place Association, for the purpose of requesting exemption from dividing Wuyuan and returning it to Jiangxi, held a joint meeting at the Huining Guild Hall the day before yesterday.

The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Toothbrush Union Opposes Workers of Yixin Factory Petitioning the Party and Government Due to Factory Shutdown</h3>
<p>The Yixin Toothbrush Factory on Manufacturing Bureau Road in Nanshi employs more than 80 workers. Labor and capital have always cooperated well. According to the factory's custom, every summer, due to sluggish business, there is a reduction in work. Both parties understand each other and have never had any problems. Since the factory appointed a new manager, Dai Zhicheng, it has changed its previous practices. Recently, the period for reducing work has arrived again. The factory did not notify the workers in advance, nor did it obtain approval from higher authorities. The workers unanimously opposed it. On the one hand, they continued to work, and on the other hand, they recommended Zhu Guan根, Zhang Quanyong, and Liu Zubei as representatives to negotiate with the factory. However, no results were obtained. They also believed that Liu Bohan had opened the motor without authorization, which was detrimental to factory regulations, and immediately dismissed him. On the morning of the 4th, they refused to allow the workers to enter the factory to work. The workers believed that the factory had closed the factory for no reason, hindering the workers' livelihood. They immediately recommended Liu Zubei, Zhu Guan根, and ten others to petition the party and government agencies and the General Labor Union, requesting them to order the factory to start work. The General Labor Union sent personnel to persuade them and decided that the factory would not dismiss the workers, and the workers would accept the principle of reducing work. Both parties agreed, but the factory temporarily changed its attitude, resulting in the failure of mediation. It will be awaiting the disposal of the party and government.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Tianjin Wired Telegraph Lines Restored Yesterday</h3>
<p>The land wired telegraph lines between Shanghai and Tianjin were interrupted a few days ago when more than 60 telegraph poles were blown down in Hushu Pass during a windstorm. The telegraph bureaus of the respective areas actively sent workers to repair them. According to news from the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, the Shanghai-Tianjin land wired telegraph lines were completely restored yesterday. In addition, the wired telegraph lines from Shanghai to Changzhou and Nanjing were also fully restored at the same time.</p>
<h3>Women's National Goods Annual Meeting Introduces National Goods for Summer Use</h3>
<p>The Municipal Women's National Goods Year Movement Committee, due to the arrival of summer and the flood of foreign goods on the market, is deeply concerned that the people of the country will not be able to distinguish them and will be easily deceived. It has specifically obtained the consent of the China Huamei Tobacco Company to publish advertisements in major newspapers introducing national goods for summer use and the names of the manufacturing companies so that the people of the country can use their consumption to purchase national goods in a way that is appropriate. It is reported that this advertisement has been published in major newspapers on the 1st of this month. At the same time, in order to arouse readers' interest in using national goods, the association also attached guess-the-words and puzzle-gift methods. After the publication in newspapers, readers from Japan and other foreign ports have sent more than 1,000 letters to guess, and the interest is extremely high. It is learned that the association will announce the meaning of the words and patterns on the 8th of this month in various newspapers, and each successful guesser will be given a beautiful national goods product and a Huamei Tobacco Company paper fan.</p>
<h3>The Business of the Joint Gift Company; More Than 30 Companies Have Entrusted Gifts</h3>
<p>The United Gift Stock Company at No. 110 Sichuan Road in this port is the first production and marketing service organization in our country. It has been in preparation for a long time, and everything is about to be completed. The company's business is to accept the entrustment of various merchants to handle gift matters, so as to entertain customers. Customers can accumulate the joint gift coupons obtained from the various goods they purchase, and exchange them for gifts at the joint gift exchange offices set up by the company. There are many advantages. The most important points are about the following four points: (1) Easy to accumulate coupons: Joint gift coupons are adopted by most merchants and are universal. The nature is that the public can easily obtain coupons, and the accumulation is extremely convenient, which is a real saving of expenses. (2) Gift self-selection: The company has more than 700 kinds of gifts, all of which are exquisite and practical, printed with a catalog, and coupon holders can choose themselves, so they will definitely be satisfied. (3) No one is empty-handed: Joint gift coupons are always valid, so they can be accumulated at any time and exchanged at any time, without any date restrictions or the need to rush, and no one will be empty-handed. (4) Convenient exchange: The gift exchange locations in this port are located at the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road. The locations with exchange offices outside the port include Nanjing, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Xuzhou, Hankou, Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Jinan, Bengbu, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Yichang, Hangzhou, Jinhua, Guangzhou, Kaifeng, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Pukou, Puzhen, Anqing, Datong, Shaoxing, Shengxian, Ningbo, Lanxi, Huzhou, Quzhou, Jiaxing, Pinghu, Nanchang, Dinghai, Yuyao, Wenzhou, Haimen, Gu惊头, Nantong, Songjiang, Beixinzhen, and other places. In other places, you can directly exchange them by mail to the Shanghai Head Office, which is extremely convenient. This plan of the company not only benefits the public but also enables the merchants who use joint gift coupons to maintain their existing business and promote future sales. Therefore, production and sales are separated, and the company serves as an intermediary, planning everything, so that everyone can work together and carry each other, and the result will be the development of industry and commerce, the revitalization of industry, and the salvation of the current depressed market. It is heard that more than 30 companies in the industrial and commercial sector have entrusted their gifts, including Zhongfa Pharmacy, Watson's Soda Company, Tianyiwei Mother Factory, Taifeng Company, Liang Xinji, West Lake Condensed Milk Company, China Oil Factory, China Underwear Company, Dahua Industrial Society, Yaguang Manufacturing Company, Kaili Silk Company, Jinhai Trading Company, Tianjin Beer Company, Peacock Chemical Society, Damei Tobacco Company, Beilai Ting Foreign Company, and dozens of others are still in contact. Those who have signed contracts are very enthusiastic. It is scheduled to open in early August, and there will be a grand event at that time.</p>

In view of this, Shanghai merchants Chen and Gao plan to hold an exhibition in Shanghai. Preparations have been underway for several months and are now in storage. It will open soon. The types of lanterns include Four Seasons Pavilion, Ten Thousand Years Pavilion, Hundred Flowers Pavilion, Old Plum Pavilion, Yanchun Pavilion, Linglong Pavilion, Chrysanthemum Pavilion, Ten Thousand Characters Pavilion, Orchid Pavilion, Wind and Moon Pavilion, many colorful umbrellas, and three colorful lions.

<h3>Boiler Explosion at Minhang Zhongfu Dyeing Factory; Many Killed and Injured; Blood and Flesh Flying, a Tragic Sight</h3>
<p>The Zhongfu Dyeing Factory in Xiaoshi, East City, Minhang Town, southwest of this port, purchased 50 to 60 acres of land last year, built factory buildings with a capital of one million, and has a large scale. It was completed this spring. All the machinery was manufactured by the Shanghai Wangshuntai Machinery Factory and has been arranged. It is currently in the trial operation period, so it has not yet officially started work. Dong Yongqing, the manager of the factory, recently found that the hot water boiler installed in the northwest corner was slightly damaged and immediately notified Wang Shuntai to send mechanics Wang Ada (from Wuxi, 20 years old) and Zhang Shougen (from Shanghai, 24 years old) to the factory for repairs on June 30. At 2:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, the boiler suddenly exploded with a loud bang, and it was heard in the vicinity. Wang Ada and Zhang Shougen were working under the furnace at the time and could not escape, resulting in their bodies being in different places, blood and flesh flying, a tragic sight. After the incident, only a few bones were found. At the time of the explosion, factory workers Ji Haorong (from Jiangyin, 38 years old), Dong Youfa (from Shaoxing, 28 years old), and Fang Linfu (from Xiaoshan, 30 years old) were also working next to the furnace and were seriously injured in the explosion. For a time, the order in the factory was in chaos, and cries shook the place. Shen Huanlun, the director of the first branch of the local county public security bureau, heard the alarm and personally led all the armed police officers to the scene to maintain order. On the one hand, the three injured workers were taken by car to Minhang Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of the injuries, they were transferred to the Red Cross on Haige Road after bandaging. However, Ji Haorong died before reaching the hospital. Dong Youfa and Fang Linfu are still in critical condition. The bodies of Wang Ada and Zhang Shougen, who had died, were inspected by personnel from the local court yesterday, and the bodies were handed over to their families to prepare coffins for burial, pending verification. Since the accident, the staff in the factory have been scattered, and the factory buildings in various departments have been locked. It is not known when work will start.</p>
<h3>Under Severe Drought, People Earnestly Pray for Rain; Villagers in West Shanghai Cause Trouble Due to Praying for Rain</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Group of the Christian "Chinese Christian Faith in Action to Save the Nation Ten-Person Group" believes that the weather is severely dry, the rice is withered, and it will become a disaster. The heat is so high that it has not been seen in decades, which will lead to drought and famine, and the trend of plague is worrying. It is also learned that there is this phenomenon in the Americas. After sincere prayers in various churches, God graciously sent rain to solve this crisis. Therefore, the group notified the members of the various churches in Shanghai to hold sincere prayers, so as to obtain an early rainfall, so as to benefit agricultural production and stabilize the people's hearts.</p>
<p>The gentry and merchants of Pudong have been experiencing continuous drought, and not a drop of rain has fallen around this port. Gentry and merchants Pan Zhiwen and Shen Xingyuan in Pudong believe that the disaster in various villages is gradually becoming serious, and the suffering of the farmers is great. They initiated the act of welcoming gods to pray for rain. The idol was exposed to the scorching sun in front of the 钦赐仰殿. Since yesterday, they hired thirty Yutu to set up a Taoist temple in the temple, chanting sutras and worshiping Buddha day and night. They will not stop praying until the sky brings rain. In addition, pig merchants in the Yangjing Town area have also automatically stopped slaughtering since yesterday. It is expected that the towns along the shore will respond to the stop of slaughtering in the next day or two in order to pray firmly.</p>
<h3>Farmers in West Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the summer, the weather has been hot, severely dry, and without rain. The seedlings planted have been scorched by the scorching sun, and it has become a drought disaster. Therefore, the farmers in the western suburbs of Shanghai held a grand prayer meeting, which was very exciting and lively. At about 11:00 a.m. yesterday, when the prayer meeting was parading on Hongqiao Road, more than a dozen villagers suddenly held up cloth dragons tied with cloth and tried to walk forward, but they were stopped by Pan Huicheng and Gu Zhaotang, members of the Hongqiao Town Guard Group in Pousong District, in order to avoid disorder. However, the villagers did not listen to the command and stabbed Pan Huicheng's shoulder with a knife, and Gu Zhaotang was beaten and seriously injured. They fired several shots into the sky as a warning, but there were too many people, and it was not easy to retreat for a while. In the end, the crowd snatched two pistols. Later, the Public Security Bureau sent police to arrive, and they dispersed. They are now investigating and arresting the villagers who caused the trouble, and they must be brought to justice.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Agricultural Association Suggests that the Municipal Government Form a Drought Prevention Committee; Formulate a Disaster Prevention Implementation Plan; The Social Bureau Plans to Provide Relief to Farmers</h3>
<p>Since the summer, the weather has been severely dry, the crops have withered, and a drought disaster will occur. Farmers in various districts are blindly following superstition, stopping slaughtering and praying for rain. The Municipal Agricultural Association, in order to plan effective drought relief and disaster prevention, has specially submitted a request to the Municipal Government to lead the implementation. The Municipal Social Bureau is also actively paying attention to disaster prevention measures. The details of the situation are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Submitting a Request to the Municipal Government for Active Implementation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Agricultural Association submitted a document to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating that it had made suggestions on drought relief and disaster prevention due to the long-term drought. It is hoped that it will be reviewed and implemented. Since the beginning of summer, there has been little rainfall, and the rivers and lakes have dried up. After the onset of mildew, rice, cotton, and beans need water to nourish them. However, the weather is extremely dry. Various crops in the fields have gradually withered. If no measures are taken to provide relief, it will be difficult for them to grow. The disaster is about to occur, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. The impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood is not shallow. The farmers are the most direct victims. Since the establishment of the country is based on agriculture, the people's clothing and food, and the country's taxes are all dependent on the farmers. If our country's agriculture is so declining, how can we endure the frequent occurrence of disasters? Although it is said to be a natural disaster, man can conquer nature, and it is not difficult to save it. However, the economic situation of the rural areas in this city is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the farmers' knowledge is naive. It is difficult for the farmers to plan drought relief and disaster prevention work independently. Therefore, drought relief and disaster prevention can only be successful if the government and the people work together. At this time when the drought is obvious and the harvest is worrying, if we can prevent problems before they occur, we can avoid disasters in the future. If we listen to nature and cause disasters, not only will the farmers' livelihood be difficult, but the city's treasury will also be affected by the poor harvest and will be even more stretched. In order to prevent problems before they occur, this association plans to hold a city-wide drought prevention campaign to make up for the unexpected. We have prepared a summary of the implementation of drought relief and disaster prevention and respectfully ask you to review it to see if it is appropriate. We respectfully present this to Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai City, and Yu Zhenhui, the Executive Director of the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Association.</p>
<h3>Implementation Plan for Drought Relief and Disaster Prevention</h3>
<p>The outline of Shanghai's drought relief implementation plan is as follows: (1) Since the beginning of summer, the city has experienced severe drought, leading to withering crops and farmers resorting to superstitious practices. To find practical drought prevention measures, the government and the people must work together to engage in drought prevention movements. (2) Organize the Shanghai Drought Prevention Movement Committee and its district branches. (3) The Drought Prevention Movement Committee will be composed of representatives from various municipal government bureaus and legal entities. (4) The mayor will serve as the chairman of the Drought Prevention Movement Committee. (5) At the beginning of the drought prevention movement, the mayor will personally inspect the rural areas to provide guidance. (6) Purchase or rent a large number of water pumps and distribute them to various districts for water lifting. (7) All fire brigades in the city will be mobilized to use fire engines to irrigate farmland as appropriate. (8) All civil servants, school teachers, university and middle school students, district defense corps, district party headquarters, all police officers in the city, district land guards, and agricultural organizations will organize drought relief teams to start work. (9) Each drought relief team should have at least fifty teams per district, with five to ten people per team. (10) The tools for the drought relief teams include water pumps, existing water-lifting equipment, or carrying buckets of water, aiming to achieve the goal of transporting water to irrigate fields. (11) To avoid conflicts with civil servants' office hours, the work hours are set from 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. The work hours for drought relief teams organized by other sectors are not subject to this restriction. (12) Airplanes will distribute leaflets to encourage farmers to abandon superstitions (such as praying for rain and ceasing slaughter) and focus on drought relief work. (13) The funds required for the drought prevention movement will be allocated by the municipal government. (14) Special funds will be allocated for dredging and widening agricultural rivers. (15) Seek scientific drought prevention methods.</p>
<h3>City Government and Bureaus Pay Attention to Agricultural Disaster</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the climate in the city has been dry, and there has been a lack of rain. Although farmers in the districts near Shanghai have been irrigating day and night, it has not helped much. The drought is becoming a serious problem. A reporter from Dagong Daily visited Wu Huanru, the section chief of the Second Section of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and Yu Zhenhui, the executive of the Municipal Farmers' Association, to inquire about drought prevention and relief measures. It was said that if the weather does not change in the next few days, a drought will be inevitable. The authorities attach great importance to this matter and are actively planning effective relief measures. They have already sent people to contact water pump manufacturers to provide free water pumping services for farmers. They are also working on ways to prevent rice prices from rising.</p>
<h3>High Court Schedules Retrial of Liu Chongjie Case</h3>
<p>The retrial will be held in Suzhou on the 19th. The Civic Federation will discuss assisting the patriotic fighter Liu Chongwu, who was arrested for bombing a traitorous businessman on Xinza Road and sentenced to twelve years in prison. He declared his disagreement in court and appealed to the Supreme Court. At that time, various groups in Shanghai believed that Liu's actions were motivated by patriotic enthusiasm and should be given a lighter sentence, so they offered assistance. It is now learned that the Supreme Court has also ordered the Jiangsu High Court Second Branch to reject the retrial. The trial will be held at the Suzhou High Court Second Branch on the 19th of this month. Chen Binghui and others, the executive committee members of the Municipal Civic Federation, believe that this matter concerns the patriotic enthusiasm of young people and that the motive is pure, so they need to be rescued urgently. They plan to ask various groups to hold a joint meeting to discuss assistance methods.</p>
<h3>Shanghai China Travel Service Does Not Sell Tickets to Shenyang</h3>
<p>The general manager of China Travel Service went north last month to handle the technical issues of organizing the Oriental Travel Service and opening traffic. He completed his work and left Tianjin on the 29th for Qingdao. It is said that he was there to preside over the opening ceremony of the Qingdao Travel Reception Center founded by the company. He is expected to return to Shanghai around the 10th of this month. According to Deputy Manager Qin of the company, rumors that the Shanghai China Travel Service has started selling tickets to Shenyang are inaccurate. This matter has been decided by the technical meeting on traffic, that before both parties consider it to be fully completed, the ticket sales area is limited to the Pingjin area of North China. If passengers in Shanghai want to go to Shenyang, they should first take the Pinghu intermodal train to Tianjin, and then purchase tickets to Shenyang.</p>
<h3>Young Man Attempts Suicide by Jumping into the Sea Due to Economic and Marital Problems, Rescued by a Vendor and Taken Back by His Uncle for Discipline</h3>
<p>The Xinning Shao round ship of the Ningshao Company, which was going to Yong, happened to have a young man committing suicide and rescued. He has now been summoned by the Yong Public Security Bureau to bring his family members to receive him. The details of this matter are reported as follows. Young Man Jumps into the Sea</p>
<p>The Xinning Shao round ship opened in Shanghai on Wednesday and had a passenger on board, in room 58, only about twenty years old, wearing Indian silk shirts and trousers, with a cane box with him. There was nothing wrong with him after he boarded the ship. When the boat went outside the Wusong estuary, the passenger took the deck to the upper deck, and jumped out of the railing when no one was prepared. At that time, a peddler named Bao happened to pass by and saw the situation, and struggled to hug the passenger and dragged him into the cabin.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Suicide</h3>
<p>The young man was very strong, and the peddler surnamed Bao was almost overthrown by him. Fortunately, after shouting loudly, the crew members arrived and dragged the passenger into the cabin No. 58. When asked, he said his name was Wu Fusheng, who was a partner in a fruit store in Hongkou, Shanghai. He was originally from Taicang County. He could not solve the problems of economic relationship and lack of freedom in marriage, so he jumped into the sea. The crew sent a teahouse attendant to guard him in the room until Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Summon Family Members</h3>
<p>On Thursday morning, when the boat arrived in Ningbo, the ship reported to the 4th Public Security Bureau. The police came and summoned Wu to the bureau to inquire about everything, and copied two suicide notes in the cane box, one to his mother and one to his sister. Later, the Public Security Bureau inquired about the address and brand of a certain water and fruit store in Shanghai, and sent a telegram to Shanghai to summon Wu Fusheng's uncle Wu Zhiqing to Yong to take him back for discipline.</p>
<h3>Factory Worker Dies After Being Beaten, Vomiting Yellow Water, Li Suffers from Heart Disease and Rib Injuries in the Stomach, The Murderer Chen Zugan is Sentenced to Three and a Half Years</h3>
<p>Chen Zugan, a worker from Guangdong in the leaf baking department of the Minzhong Cigarette Factory at 193 Dongheng Road, 26 years old, had a verbal fight with his companion Huang Daolin from Jiangxi, 49 years old, at 12:30 on the morning of the 28th of last month over closing the motor. The bookkeeper Jian Shixiang heard the sound and stopped the fight. Unexpectedly, Huang suddenly vomited yellow water after returning home and died after a while. The body was sent to the Feilen Road autopsy station. The prosecutor sent by the First Special District Court, accompanied by a forensic doctor, went to the station to check the body, handed it over to Yang's coffin, and Chen Zugan was secretly arrested by the detectives of the Huishan Patrol Room and taken to the court. When asked, he denied it and was detained. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie from the Third Criminal Court continued the trial. Attorney Li Zhishan from the Public Works Department stated the previous situation and said that according to the injury report, the ribs of the deceased's stomach were slightly injured, but he usually suffered from heart disease, etc. Please investigate. Jian Shixiang of the factory claimed that he heard the two sides quarrel at the time, but did not see a fight. Huang Yang claimed that her husband returned home at noon with a pale face, saying that he was beaten by Chen Zugan, and fell to the ground not long after. Yellow water flowed from his nose and mouth, and he searched his trousers before he could get to bed. Her husband had no heart disease and asked for justice, etc. When asked of the defendant, his confession was evasive and denied beating Huang. Judge Xiao ruled that Chen Zugan would be sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment, and the number of days of custody before the trial was determined shall be counted as one day of imprisonment for two days.</p>
<h3>Killing for Three Yuan of Club Money, Huang Yongchi's Autopsy Record, Huang Dies from Excessive Bleeding from Liver Injury, The Murderer Wu Maoqin Does Not Admit to Stabbing with a Knife</h3>
<p>At 3:45 pm the day before yesterday, a murder occurred at No. 139 Cihou South Lane, 1238 Fuxu Road. The Jing'an Temple Patrol Room in charge of the area was informed and sent a detective Wang Yubin to send the deceased Huang Yongchi (Yongquan) to the Feilen Road autopsy station, and the murderer Wu Maoqin from Wenzhou, along with a stab knife, was taken to the patrol room for custody. It has been recorded in this newspaper that yesterday morning, the patrol room sent the corpse's family members and witnesses to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court, and Judge Xiao Fen took the seat.</p>
<p>After the interrogation, the patrol room attorney Zhang Tianyin said that he was now prosecuting the defendant Wu Maoqin for murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Law, and described the situation in detail, saying that the place where the case occurred was in the home of the witnesses Lin Zhengeng and Lin Jiangshi, husband and wife. Lin was in charge of a westerner's residence at 167 Pushi Road in the French Concession as a steward. The deceased Huang Yongchi was also a servant in a French residence at No. 30, Lane 159, Haige Road, and lived with his wife Huang Wu at No. 10 Cihou South Lane. The defendant Wu Maoqin was also a steward in a westerner's residence and was from the same industry and the same hometown as Huang Lin, so they all knew each other. They usually had close contacts and visited each other frequently, but Wu recently lost his job and had difficulty making a living, so he invited Huang Yongchi's brothers to join a club and pay three yuan per month. Huang's younger brother Yongren was also an old steward in a westerner's residence at No. 143 Lane in Yuyuan Road. Wu's request was rejected, and he suspected that Yongchi was instigating it, so he held a grudge. Yesterday afternoon, Wu went to Lin Zhengeng's house at No. 139 Cihou South Lane to play. Not long after, Huang Yongchi and his wife arrived one after another. Wu asked Huang for three yuan of club money. Huang gave Wu one yuan because Wu owed him two yuan before and should deduct it. Wu refused and started arguing, first scolding each other, then fighting. Later, Wu suddenly pulled out a newly purchased sharp knife from his sock and stabbed Huang Yongchi's abdomen, which penetrated deep into the liver. He was injured and fell to the ground, blood gushing out like a spring. At this time, the witness Lin Zhengeng saw the disaster and bravely stepped forward, twisted Wu and snatched the murder weapon, causing Lin's hand to be injured by the knife. He then called the Chinese detectives from Nos. 1913 and 1675 to come and take Wu and the knife to the patrol room. He ordered detectives to use an ambulance to send Huang to the Red Cross Society on Haige Road, but Huang died on the way before reaching the hospital. According to the doctor's autopsy report, Huang died from excessive blood loss due to injury to the liver. He was sent to the autopsy station for autopsy. Now the corpse's wife and witnesses are present for interrogation. Then, the corpse's wife Huang Wu claimed that her husband Huang Yongquan was 27 years old and from Wenzhou, and was a steward in a westerner's residence, and proved the situation of the incident. Then, the witnesses Lin Zhengeng and Lin Jiangshi successively testified the crime. When asked of the defendant Wu Maoqin, he admitted to fighting with the deceased, but firmly denied stabbing him to death with a knife. After Judge Xiao verified the confession, he ordered Wu to be detained and wait for a changed date for another verification. The detectives took Wu down and escorted him to the autopsy station. Prosecutor Zhang Junqing went to the station to check the corpse, and then ascended to the public seat and re-questioned the defendant and the witnesses. He then ordered that the deceased Huang Yongchi died from a knife wound during his lifetime, and the corpse was handed over to his wife Huang Wu for coffin burial.</p>

<h3>Taken to Another Place</h3>
<p>Geng Yang is now living at No. 7 Peiguo Lane, Dasheng Lane, in Xiaodongmen. They went to the address again and</p>
<p>arrested Geng Yang and brought her into the office. When Director Liu interrogated her, Geng said that because the rumors outside were urgent and no one had come to redeem the hostage, he had taken the hostage to the road outside Xiaodongmen on the first day of the lunar May and released him without harming him. They then dispatched undercover officers and others to secretly wait at No. 117 Danfeng Road. At 4:00 am yesterday, they saw Geng hurrying to come and pack his luggage to go to other places. The officers rushed forward and arrested the bandit leader. During the preliminary trial, Geng admitted that after kidnapping Sun Ziji,</p>
<h3>Because the Rumors were Urgent</h3>
<p>and he was afraid, he released the hostage. Because the matter was important, he ordered the preparation of documents to send the arrested bandit leader Geng Shouting (Geng Kanglin) and his mistress Geng Yang, and Yang Shousheng, Yang Yang and others, four men and women, to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for delivery to the staff for investigation and punishment. The staff from Wujiang County also submitted a request to the French Patrol Room to investigate the whereabouts of the hostage. It was found that the hostage had been arrested and left in the Patrol Room because he was lost on the way, waiting for someone to claim him. He had been transferred to the Women and Children Relief Society. The staff went to the society to confirm that the hostage was correct. The three bandits Xia Changgui, Chen Zhiqin, and Chen Shenshi arrested by the French Patrol Room were transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday afternoon to be welcomed by the Wujiang County Government for trial.</p>

<h3>The Hotel Association Holds a Meeting - Setting up an Office in the French Concession</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Hotel Association has been making considerable progress due to the leadership of capable individuals. Recently, to facilitate contact with members in the French Concession, it was decided to establish an office in the French Concession. After several detailed discussions, it was deemed necessary to establish it as soon as possible. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Hotel Association convened its 29th joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members to discuss specific implementation methods. The executive and supervisory committee members Sun Qiuping, Gao Weifu, Yan Rongqing, Xu Wen, Zhao, Yao Songnian, Xu Mengyuan, Shi Xieming, Zou Xieqing, Zhang Renliang, etc., and hotel representatives from the French Concession Yao Zhaoji, Cai Rucai, Cai Gengyue, Ren Hesan, Ye Ruizhai, Chen Yuanling, etc., were present. Chairman Sun Qiuping gave a report, and then the discussion of the case began. It was resolved that: (1) To facilitate contact with members in the French Concession, an office will be established under the name of the Shanghai Hotel Association French Concession Office, and Yao Zhaoji, Cai Rucai, Cai Gengyue, Ren Hesan, Chen Yuanling, Ye Ruizhai, and Lu Houfu will be appointed as preparatory members. (2) The office should uphold the resolutions of the Hotel Association's executive and supervisory committee meetings to serve the members. In the event of major incidents, it should report to the Hotel Association at any time for instructions. Financial matters, income, and expenditure should be reported monthly for review by the executive and supervisory committee. The remaining funds can be deposited by the office director into a designated bank and be responsibly managed. (3) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce membership fee or other special expenses should be borne equally by the office and the association. However, if the Municipal Chamber of Commerce increases the number of representatives by one, it should be appointed by the office. (4) Hotel operators in the French Concession should first fill out a voluntary application and submit it to the association. After approval, the association will issue membership certificates and distribute them to each member through the office. (5) The number of executive and supervisory committee members should be determined by the general meeting. Hereafter, if hotel operators in the French Concession unanimously join the Hotel Association, they can contact the Hotel Association through the French Concession office for any matters. The original name of the "Zhan Ye Lianhe Hui" will be canceled immediately, making operations more convenient.</p>

<h3>Answering Mr. Sima Chi on the [Problem of the Popular Language] (Continued)</h3>
<p>Mr. Sima Chi does not fundamentally recognize the contradiction between the popular language and the vernacular. His non-recognition is because he believes that [the reactionary nature of 牠 | vernacular | lies in its content, not in its form], resulting in the denial of form? Thinking; although this form is too Westernized and mixed with some [classical Chinese], resulting in separation from the majority of the [masses], it does not matter, there are still many people under its influence]. This is how dangerous the thesis! He does not understand the unity of form and content, and does not understand that the [masses] referred to here are the progressive [masses] stumbling exactly towards the [revision] on the wrong path, and invisibly cancels the meaning of this movement.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the language movement is in line with the entire cultural movement (including politics and economics). In terms of the entire cultural movement, is the current anti-imperialist and anti-feudal cultural movement simply due to the [insufficiency] and [incompleteness] of the [May Fourth] era, and come to a [correction]? Obviously not! The new nobles of the [May Fourth] era, on the one hand, were weak and could not afford these two heavy tasks; on the other hand, because the mass culture grew more and more, it made them more uneasy, and they increasingly exposed their reactionary nature, so they were not only [incomplete], but also increasingly surrendered to the imperialist and feudal forces, not only [insufficient], but also hindering the development of the new cultural movement. May I ask, who are the people currently trying to [restore the old]? Who are the people promoting [reading the classics and respecting Confucius]? We will never fail to see those new nobles of the May Fourth era. In the current task of the new cultural movement, if we deny the task of opposing those new nobles (also called the old remnants), what else can we say? What else can we talk about anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism? Why does Mr. Sima Chi not even recognize this major premise clearly?</p>
<p>If it is according to Mr. Sima Chi's words, the vernacular, although [separated from the majority of the masses], it does not matter [its reactionary nature lies in its content, not in its form], so that [as long as we see what content we use to use this form], then why do we still have to propose the construction of the popular language issue now? How do we explain that Wang Maozu's [Classical Chinese Revival] is related to the entire restoration movement? May I ask, what does it matter if we leave the masses? Mr. Sima Chi is right to pay attention to content, but because he pays attention to content and completely ignores form, even the so-called content becomes a mysterious thing, not only denying the current mass language movement, but also denying the development and achievements of the entire language movement since the [May Fourth] era. This is how serious the mistake is, how can it be just rash?</p>
<p>Taking a step back, even if Mr. Sima Chi wants to criticize us for proposing anti-vernacular], it is because we are afraid of disrupting the battle line and reducing our own strength. It is still wrong. Mr. Sima Chi only [sees the individual, but does not see the whole], sees the quantity, but does not see the quality. In every movement, what we mainly do is to establish a solid front line of overall unity. How to establish it? It is to pay attention to the simultaneous development of quantity and quality, to absorb the new, and to expel the corrupt and old. Simply to keep the quality looking good, while allowing many corrupt and old elements to remain in the whole, it is not enough to prevent the confusion of the front line, but also has the danger of making the whole generally corrupted. This is the worship of [opportunity] consciousness! May I ask, should those old remnants of the [May Fourth] era, who are promoting [quotation style], [foreign eight-legged essays], and [archaeology] groups, be [opposed]? And although Mr. Chen Wangdao, Xia Gaizun, and Ye Shengtao are also figures in the [May Fourth] vernacular movement, they have already entered the camp of the non-mass language movement. Can they still be compared with those old remnants?</p>
<p>Above, perhaps Mr. Sima Chi will think it is [nitpicking] and [confusing the battle line] again, but in fact we have no intention of doing so. We believe that if we want this mass language movement to reach a correct conclusion, we must clarify the meaning of this movement. We therefore cannot but bring it up again to discuss.</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Therefore, Emperor Guangxu and Empress Longyu were, in fact, cousins. Despite this, there was no real love between them. Originally, in the past, the marriage of men and women was decided by their parents; both parties were like blind people, allowing others to arrange everything, thus unhappy incidents often occurred in families. Although Emperor Guangxu was the ruler of a country, he could not escape this constraint, so later he and Empress Longyu not only had no love for each other but also resented and hated each other, like enemies.</p>
<p>In Guangxu's life, the only woman he truly loved was Consort Zhen. However, when the Boxer Rebellion occurred in the Gengzi year, she had already been thrown into the well in the northeast corner of Shenwu Gate by those eunuchs. Because they felt that Consort Zhen was an insignificant person in the palace and not worth the effort of dragging her along to Xi'an, they simply got rid of her. (It is said that Consort Zhen's body has not been retrieved to this day, and only a stone slab has been placed over the well.) Of course, the eunuchs would not have dared to be so bold without someone's suggestion: then who made this suggestion? Hmph! Hmph! It was none other than our Empress Dowager! The Empress Dowager had long disliked Consort Zhen because Guangxu favored her too much; after the Reform Movement of 1898 broke out, someone slandered Consort Zhen in front of the Empress Dowager, saying that Consort Zhen was the mastermind behind Guangxu's actions, so the Empress Dowager was determined to execute her.</p>
<p>After Consort Zhen's death, the pain Guangxu suffered in his heart was naturally profound. His only happiness and only joy were completely extinguished from then on! But he was still an emperor after all, and he could not easily commit suicide or run away like a commoner; he could only secretly grieve and shed tears. Consort Zhen also had a sister, who was also married to Guangxu as a concubine, named Consort Jin. After Consort Zhen was killed, Guangxu cherished her even more: he felt that only in her could he find some solace for his soul. This time, Empress Longyu and Consort Jin also went to Fengtian with the Empress Dowager. They lived together in a carriage, and they were quite harmonious with each other: but these two people had no special status in the palace, and generally just ate and dressed. (77)</p>
<h3>Hot Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Han Liang</p>
<p>The heat wave arrived in Suzhou, and the newspaper said it was unprecedented in sixty years. There were no thermometers before, so it's impossible to make an accurate comparison. But according to elders, it was also very hot in the eighteenth year of Guangxu. The tin ornament on the flagpole in front of the Suzhou Weaving Office actually melted into liquid and dripped down. So this year's heat can only be said to be unprecedented in forty years. Suzhou's cold drinks always rely entirely on watermelons, but watermelons have not been on the market for long, and the quantity is also very small. One dollar buys four or five, and the taste is not good, so it feels even more thirsty, irritable, and dizzy, with no solution. Ice cream is too aristocratic: sour plum soup is not clean: and soda has a weak thirst-quenching effect. The water from the tiger stoves is turbid, so they hire people to fetch water from outside the city, which is too costly, and some have even closed down. The seriousness of the situation cannot be overstated. Some people advocate that fire brigades in various sections use pumps to draw water and pour it into the city moat, but there are many obstacles to implementation. If God plays a trick and doesn't rain again, Suzhou people will panic about drinking water. At that time, the latent outbreak of epidemics is also within expectations.</p>
<p>"[Go to the park!]” is naturally the most fashionable slogan,</p>
<p>But the journey there and back is enough to make people sweat profusely from the heat. Once there, there are so many people that the heat is considerable. Although you get a little coolness for a while, it doesn’t help the overall situation, so it’s just like a drunken old man who’s not really there for the wine, but is happy to go anyway. Someone like me, who is reluctant to dress up, considers it a daunting task.</p>
<p>At this time, there was also the Shanghai White Rainbow Team, the Wuxi Liangxi Team, and the Suzhou Jianmei Team, jointly holding a triangular track and field competition. Running and jumping under the scorching sun of 110 degrees is truly admirable. Even some of the spectators couldn't stand it. But Mr. Wu Shilan, who is used to electric fans and iced drinks, and his wife, Ms. Yao Yunmei, also came, sweating, to preside over the meeting and give awards, showing a spirit of resisting the heat.</p>
<p>"[Invite the Bronze Guanyin!]” is also Suzhou people’s "[signature move,]" but after inviting it for a few days, it still didn't rain. It's a pity that Qian Duqiao can't be resurrected, otherwise, it would be fun to have another Bimiaoguan rain prayer. But the act of slaughter ban, fasting, setting up altars, and praying will soon have to be performed, and it is also unpredictable. Originally, in this era, on the one hand, the banner of science is held up, and changes in the weather are not to be feared; on the other hand, people still hold the signs of scientific spirit mediums and religious supervisors, relying on the heavens for food. Society is eternally contradictory in this way.</p>

<p>Timely rain and sunshine bring success to the fields. If there is a prolonged drought, the soil cracks, then there is a ceremony to pray for rain. The Huajing says; "[To pray for sweet rain]," which shows that praying for rain is very ancient. According to old customs, praying for rain must first be accompanied by a notice from the local official banning slaughter, meaning that there is too much killing in the lower realm, which has angered the heavens. Banning slaughter is to atone for offenses. If it doesn't rain for three days, then five days, if it doesn't rain for five days, then seven days. Northeast Fourth Company Commander Zhang Mu wrote</p>
<h3>Chapter 31: Three Battles, White-Clad Soldiers Charge into Snow Formation, Entire Battalion Sacrifices for the Country, Red-Eyed Soldiers Enter the Gunfire</h3>
<p>There were four people lying on the sorghum stalks, next to him was Sergeant Wang Shili. He was groaning. When he saw Ziqiang, he raised a hand with a sad smile and pointed to his side. When Ziqiang looked, he was injured, with purple marks showing through his clothes, or with scars. He said; Old Wang, you... He still smiled, and his hand drooped down, resting on his chest, pressing on a pocket, with a diary sticking out of the pocket. Ziqiang said; Brother, don't worry, I'll send a letter to your family. His eyes were dull, and his smile slowly faded. He sacrificed for the country, fulfilling his duty as a soldier. Ziqiang suddenly woke up and encountered this incident. He understood something in his heart. Clearly, Wang Shili was gritting his teeth, waiting for him to say a few words. Calming his mind, he carefully examined his whole body and felt that there was no particular pain anywhere. Perhaps he was not injured, which was fortunate. As for lying down in a daze, he probably fell and was injured. So he pressed his hands on the sorghum stalks and slowly propped himself up. He felt that his head was a little heavy and he couldn't lift it up, so he had to endure it and went back to sleep. After a while, Battalion Commander Shi came. Although he had been fighting all night, his uniform was neatly worn, his hat was straight, his face was clean, and his cheekbones were slightly red. As soon as he came in, he saw that Ziqiang was awake and smiled; Company Commander Zhao, you are better, it's nothing, you're just too tired. Ziqiang said; Thank you, Battalion Commander, for visiting me. Wang Shili, he's gone, just now. Baofang looked at Wang Shili, holding his hat in his hand, and couldn't help but lower his head. But this was only for two minutes. Two minutes later, Baofang immediately became excited and said to Ziqiang; I think we have reinforcements, they may arrive this afternoon. The little devils suffered a lot from us last night. You rest. After Baofang finished speaking, he left. After a while, two brothers came to carry Wang Shili away. Ziqiang said; In his pocket, there may be a letter home. You search it. (428)</p>
<p>Rain must fall before slaughter is allowed again. Although gourmets find it bitter, it concerns grain, so they dare not criticize it.</p>
<p>There is the Bronze Guanyin Hall in Guangfu Township, Gusu. The Guanyin enshrined there is quite spiritually efficacious. Whenever drought causes disaster, officials and people prepare ceremonial guards and carriages to welcome it from Xiangxuehai. It is said that when the Bronze Guanyin arrives, the Rain Master will follow. Once there is sufficient moisture to nourish the crops and vegetables, the farmers celebrate with joy as usual. After a few days, they send it back with respectful ceremonies. According to legend, once the Bronze Guanyin was welcomed to pray for rain, and the wish was fulfilled. For the sake of convenience and saving trouble, the Ning people handed the Bronze Guanyin to a boatman to send it back. Unexpectedly, a severe drought continued thereafter. The officials and people thought that in addition to the slight disrespect, the Guanyin's energy had been disturbed. They burned incense and kowtowed repeatedly before it stopped. Since then, they have not dared to repeat the mistake of welcoming lavishly and sending back shabbily. Such is the myth, which is also enough for conversation. I still remember that one year the Bronze Guanyin was welcomed at Mingdao Hall in Canglang Pavilion. I once went to see it. The Guanyin was made of bronze, only two or three feet high, wearing a plain kasaya, sitting upright in a glass niche, and decorated with golden flowers. There were plaques on both sides, such as "Auspicious Light Shines Everywhere" and "Kindness Flows with Compassion," which were all bestowed by the Qing Dynasty. Common foolish men and women went to worship one after another,</p>
<p>The incense smoke was thick, never dissipating all day long. To the left of the hall was the Shrine of Five Hundred Worthies. In the courtyard, bamboos were planted in clusters. Foolish men and women plucked branches and leaves to take home, saying that they were divine objects that could cure chronic diseases. Within ten days, the bamboos in the Shrine of Worthies were all gone. Then they peeled the white bark pine trees to replace them. The pine trees also withered and died, becoming a joke at the time. This summer has also been a prolonged drought without rain. Amidst the voices of praying for rain, I record this to amuse the readers.</p>

<h3>"The Fishing Platform of Yanling Should Be on Mount Fuchun" and Other Refutations and Postscript (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Chen Shicheng</p>
<p>The ancients mostly created geography behind closed doors, not through actual field investigation. This judgment under the Unified Records is likely mistaken due to the records in the Collected Readings and the New Anzhi. The Collected Readings was written by Wang Youxue of the Yuan Dynasty. His annotation on Mount Fuchun is: "[The New Anzhi says, Mount Fuchun is located west of Fuchun County in the Han Dynasty. Later, to avoid the taboo of Empress Zheng of Emperor Jianwen of the Jin Dynasty, it was renamed Fuyang. According to the biography of Yan Guang, he farmed on Mount Fuchun. The Illustrated Classic does not record this mountain; it only says that the mountain now called Mount Yanling is where he fished. (The stone-printed version says 'where he farmed.' Which is correct, there is no way to verify; it is noted here for the consideration of the wise.)" It records that Yan Guang was from Fuyang and farmed on Mount Fuchun. The Book of Song by Shen Yue; During the Wu Dynasty, part of Fuchun County was used to establish Tonglu County; then there is no doubt that Mount Yanling is Mount Fuchun." Carefully examining the wording of this passage; he could not verify the location since the Illustrated Classic did not record Mount Fuchun, so he associated Tonglu with being part of Fuchun County in the Han Dynasty, and Mount Yanling being located forty li south of Tonglu in Qilipu; therefore, he concluded that Mount Fuchun is Mount Yanling. However, this is just a guess and conjecture, and there is no strong evidence at all. Reading the four words "[but says]" "[yet records]" shows that he unconsciously revealed his unease! If Wang Youxue could thoroughly understand the annotations of the biography of Yan Guang, I think he would never have made this seemingly correct but flawed judgment. (Reading the above will reveal this. Not daring to be assertive. Collected Readings Correction by Chen Ji of the Ming Dynasty; it can be seen that the textual research of the Collected Readings is not entirely reliable.) The Collected Readings made a mistake in the past, and the Unified Records made another mistake in the future, and even Feng Zhishu's Solid Evidence quoted the Unified Records as evidence that Mount Fuchun is in Tonglu County; it can be said that it is a triple mistake.</p>
<p>Based on the opinions obtained from the History of the Later Han Dynasty and its annotations; we can see mountains, place names, and administrative areas merging in history at any time, such as Zhongmou, Tiantai, and the like. Since the Illustrated Classic does not record the name Mount Fuchun, it can be seen that the Mount Fuchun mentioned in the biography of Yan Guang does not refer to a specific mountain peak; it only says that Guang farmed in Fuchun. The annotation does not say "[in the territory of Fuyang County, Hangzhou now]" but says "[it is Fuyang County, Hangzhou now]," which is also this meaning. If he was referring to a specific mountain peak, how could the Illustrated Classic not record its name? Therefore, Lord Huo's attempt to verify which mountain peak is Mount Fuchun is perhaps like his determination that a certain large rock is a fishing rock—both are digressions. (Lord Huo has now added "[large group]" to the four words "[ochre black large rock]," which can be said to be good at making up for mistakes.)</p>
<p>Lord Huo also cited Lu You's "Record of Buying Fields at the Fishing Terrace in Yanzhou" to prove that farming and fishing were in the same place; he cited Xie Lingyun's "Record of Crying Bitterly on the West Terrace" to prove that the fishing terrace was on Mount Fuchun. Carefully reading the original text of the "Record of Crying Bitterly" cited by Lord Huo, the three words Mount Fuchun are never seen from beginning to end. I don't know how he can prove that the mountain where the terrace was built is called Mount Fuchun? If he can carefully read the "Record of Buying Fields," he will surely know that this record not only does not prove that farming and fishing were in the same place, but is also his refutation. The "Record of Buying Fields" says; "[Reading Cui Ru's 'Record of the Fishing Terrace' from the Xingyuan period of the Tang Dynasty, I thought there were a hundred mu of flat fields on top, enough for diligent farming, and a clear stream below, enough for angling; now the place for angling is present, but the fields are gone...]." If there were indeed fields farmed by Yan Guang on the mountain, Fang Weng could only say that they were barren and unsuitable for farming, and would never dare to say that they were gone. Carefully interpreting Fang Weng's meaning, it is clear that he is saying that he was fooled by Cui Ru, thinking that there were a hundred mu of flat fields on top, but when he experienced it firsthand, he realized that there were no fields farmed by Mr. Yan on the mountain; the meaning is very clear, why doesn't Lord Huo think deeply about it?</p>
<p>I have always held the principle of "[knowing is knowing, not knowing is not knowing]." When encountering unreliable evidence, I use words such as "[perhaps]" "[maybe]" to indicate that I have insights, but I dare not, and disdain to, rely on blind citations to make assertive statements, causing knowledgeable people to find it ridiculous. There is no end to learning. The books I have seen are just a drop in the ocean; fundamentally, I am not qualified to be a textual researcher. Nor dare I be self-righteous and harshly criticize others, thereby damaging my own character. I dare not accept the title bestowed by Lord Huo.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The debate about "The Fishing Platform of Yanling" has been published repeatedly. It is difficult to judge who is right and who is wrong. How can Ziling be raised from the ground and asked? The space in this publication is limited, and there are too many accumulated manuscripts. The debate between the two parties will stop here. No further submissions will be published.</p>

<h3>Shandong Province: Military Training Enthusiasm is High</h3>
<p>Students Marching and Assembling in the Rain, Receiving Training Without Complaint</p>
<p>(Jinan Express) More than 3,000 students from Shandong high schools are divided into four camps and trained in Jinan, Yanzhou, and Qingzhou. The military training began on the 2nd of this month. Li Shuchun and He Siyuan, the chairmen of the military training committee, went to Yanzhou yesterday (the 3rd) at 10:00 am to guide the student military training in various places and arrived at 3:00 pm. They immediately summoned the third camp of students for training and gave encouraging speeches. They also highly commended the fact that the area had been experiencing heavy rain for several days, and a class of Qufu students marched more than thirty miles to Yanzhou in the rain, showing great enthusiasm and interest. They also gave speeches to the government officials of Ziyang County and inspected the prison. Now that their work is completed, they will return to Jinan by train No. 306 on the Pingpu line at 4:00 pm today (the 4th). They will go to Qingzhou at 10:00 am tomorrow (the 5th). The statements made by Li and He to reporters upon their arrival in Jinan are recorded below.</p>
<p>(Qingdao, 6th) He Siyuan, Director of the Shandong Education Department, sent 130 military training students from Shandong University in armored vehicles.</p>
<h3>Hubei High School Students' Summer Military Training is Strict</h3>
<p>Six University Students Expelled from Military and Academic Registration for Disobeying Orders</p>
<p>Education Department Orders Schools to Rectify Morale and Prohibit Abandonment</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence. The summer military training for high school students and above in Hubei Province has now begun. Fu Wen, Director of the Mountain Military Training Office, Hu Xuexi, Director of Education, and Zhou Jingwu, Chief Instructor of the Training Headquarters stationed in Hubei and concurrently Captain, are in charge of the work. The students of various schools are divided into four major teams. Chairman Jiang awarded military uniforms, and the Third Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the Three Provinces allocated guns and ammunition. On the 3rd, a march and military exercise was held in Hongshan*, a suburb of Wuchang. The order was well maintained. During training on the 4th, six students from the first team, including Wan Hancheng and Chen Shipei from Zhonghua University, Wang Zuozhou and Peng Youshan from the Academy of Fine Arts, and Jiang Zhigui and Huang Tianchi from the Education College, showed contempt for officers and disobeyed orders. Deng Xiongfei, the officer of the day, reported this to Director Fu Wen, who notified Chen Shi, President of Zhonghua University, Tang Yijing, President of the Academy of Fine Arts, and Luo Tingguang, President of the Education College, by telephone. The office announced their expulsion from the military and the Education Department notified the schools to expel them from their academic registration. The students involved were handed over to the presidents of their respective schools for bail. The matter was settled.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Education Department issued an instruction to the schools, stating that during this summer vacation, in order to enhance the service spirit and improve the knowledge of teachers and students, there are organizations such as the "Youth Service Corps," "Summer Military Training," "Training Courses for Science Teachers in Secondary Schools," and "Primary Education Research Association." All teachers and students participating in these organizations should strive for excellence in the spirit of endless learning and not wasting time, so as to live up to the original purpose of establishing these organizations and encouraging learning. However, there are still teachers and students in various schools who have not been able to participate in the above organizations. During the summer vacation, they have a lot of free time, which is the right time to review the past and plan for the future to improve their physical and mental health and make contributions to society. From now on, they should all reflect on themselves, hate evil like an enemy, and not indulge in any bad habits. They must also encourage and supervise each other and strive to make progress. Those who do not accept advice and abandon themselves may be secretly reported for punishment.</p>
<h3>The Second Batch of Summer Military Training in Shanghai City Assembles in Nanshi This Morning</h3>
<p>Military training is held for schools above high school in Shanghai City, divided into two batches for training. The first batch has been underway since July 1. Because the training headquarters is training seriously, the students receiving training in various schools are very well-groomed. A reporter saw more than 100 students from Minli Middle School in Nanshi yesterday morning. They were wearing gray cloth military uniforms, all with belts and leggings, just like regular soldiers. According to the report of the instructor, they will hold assembly training with Jingye and Upper Middle Schools at Xiaodongmen at about 5:00 this morning. The instructor also informed the students of various strategies such as reconnaissance, reporting military intelligence, and tactical offensives on Wenmiao Road. It is reported that the chief military training officer sent to Shanghai this time is Mr. Chen Zhaoxin. Whenever there is an assembly training, Chen always goes to the field to inspect. He Chongti, director of the military training association, is the commander-in-chief and attaches great importance to the military training of various schools. The results of this year are expected to be considerable. It is reported that after the end of the first batch of military training, the second batch will be trained three weeks before the start of school.</p>
<h3>Shanghai First Special District Public Works Department Distributes Education Subsidies</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Notifies Various Schools</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau instructed 73 schools, including private Qingnian Middle School, that the Bureau had previously approved a letter from the First Special District Public Works Department verifying the school's education subsidy for 1934 and the first phase of distribution dates, which had been notified in the record. Now, a letter from the Public Works Department has been received, stating that the second phase of subsidies for the school will be distributed from the 6th of this month and requesting that the schools be instructed to pay attention to the points mentioned in paragraph 3 of the letter dated May 31.

<p>The Education Bureau also instructed 30 schools, including Private Guangxia Middle School, that the Bureau had previously received a request from the school for the allocation of education subsidies from the First Special District Public Works Department for 1934. The Bureau had sent staff to investigate and review in detail. The first batch of subsidized schools had also been approved by the Public Works Department and announced in the record. Now, a public letter from the Public Works Department has been received, translated as follows: (above omitted) Other schools not listed in the previous table have now been reviewed, and the schools and the amount of subsidies are attached in another table. Although some schools are not perfect, the fees for the first two phases of this year will be issued as a temporary measure. Please inform them to come to the Bureau to receive them on July 6th and please instruct the schools to pay attention to the points mentioned in paragraph 3 of the letter dated May 31. It is hoped that this will be done. And the school's annual ordinary subsidy will be approved. Therefore, it is instructed to inform the school of this order.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Suspends Subsidies for 30 Schools, Including Fudan Shizhong</h3>
<p>Due to Imperfect Sanitation Facilities, etc.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau instructed 30 schools, including Fudan Shizhong, that the Bureau had previously received a request from the school for the allocation of education subsidies from the First Special District Public Works Department for 1934. The Bureau had sent staff to investigate and review, and informed the Public Works Department to handle the matter on record. Now, a public letter from the Public Works Department has been received, translated as follows: (above omitted) Some schools are really inconvenient to accommodate. The subsidy for this year will not be issued. A separate table is attached, with the reasons stated separately. The comments on the sanitary inspection are reported in detail by the Public Health Office, such as "imperfect sanitation facilities," etc. Fudan Shizhong should move out of the concession before the end of July. The so-called "unsuitable" annotation means that any aspect of the school does not meet the regulations and must be changed immediately. It is hoped that the Bureau will agree. The "fire risk" annotation is based on the inspection report of the fire chief. The schools should quickly seek remedial measures. The attached table lists that the school's subsidy for this year will not be issued due to imperfect sanitation facilities or other unsuitability and fire risk. Therefore, it is instructed to inform the school of this order.</p>
<p>Qunxiao Elementary School · Ningbo Gongxiao Elementary School and four other schools: The Bureau previously approved a letter from the First Special District Public Works Department verifying the subsidy for private schools in the district for 1934, which had been approved in the record. Now, a letter from the Public Works Department has been received, stating that the school's subsidy for this year will not be issued temporarily due to unsuitable management. Therefore, it is instructed to inform the school of this order.</p>
<h3>Children's Health Camp Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Children's Innocent and Orderly Life</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, Health Bureau, Children's Morning Post, China Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Children's Happiness Committee, and other five agencies have jointly created a summer children's health camp in order to improve children's physical and mental health and develop good hygiene habits by using the summer vacation. Preparations have been underway for a long time and have been completed. Yesterday (the 6th) was the registration day. The location is at the Affiliated High School of Tongji University in Wusong. After 9:00 yesterday morning, children and parents gathered at the First Public Stadium. The Education Bureau specially prepared three cars to send them to Wusong. After arriving, the children all played freely. At lunchtime, all the children washed their hands before being led to the cafeteria by teachers. Each person used two pairs of chopsticks and two spoons to prevent infection. The parents who went with them were also treated to lunch by the camp. The dishes were delicious and very suitable for children's nourishment. After the meal, they continued to play freely. The parents were busy making beds for their children. At 1:00 pm, the children were ordered to go to bed. The life was very orderly. This move is still a new idea in China and can cultivate good habits in children. It is a pity that the camp is limited to only 100 people this time and was full before entering the camp, causing latecomers to sigh. The children have a lot of play time every day, followed by rest. In the second week, there will be a parent-teacher conference, weighing, group travel, and various competitions (kicking shuttlecock, patting ball, jumping rope, and speech) once each. The camp has also hired eight female instructors, medical consultants, and health affairs personnel to be stationed in the camp to be responsible for guidance. The children can also leave their parents and develop group life such as washing, bathing, reviewing, and playing.</p>
<h3>The Tokyo Branch of the Chinese Society for Arts and Sciences is Progressing Actively</h3>
<p>The Chinese Society for Arts and Sciences, originally named Bingshen Society, was organized and established in the fifth year of the Republic of China by Wang Zhaorong, Zheng Zhenwen, Chuan Shishuo, and other students studying in Japan. The general office was established in Shanghai in October of the ninth year of the Republic of China. Therefore, Tokyo is actually the birthplace of the Chinese Society for Arts and Sciences. In recent years, because the old members have returned to China one after another, the Tokyo branch has been suspended in form. Recently, the member of the society and the supervisor of students studying in Japan, Mr. Zhou Xianwen, went to Japan and convened the old members studying in Japan for a detailed meeting. Chen Gongliang, Li Qishan, and others were publicly elected as directors, and they immediately began soliciting new members. They plan to establish a service center after the summer vacation to facilitate the purchase of Chinese and Japanese books for members at home and abroad, and publish a regular periodical to give members studying in Japan the opportunity to express their thoughts. It is also heard that they will jointly establish a Chinese library with various Chinese institutions stationed in Japan.</p>

<p>(London, 5th, Reuters) As a result of the Wimbledon Tennis Tournament, Ms. Jacobs of the United States and Ms. Lambert of the United Kingdom have won the right to the finals. The two will decide the championship. In the semi-finals, Jacobs eliminated Hardygen, the 20-year-old Australian women's champion, and Lambert defeated Madame Mathieu of France. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Jacobs (US) 6-2, 6-2 Hardygen (Aus) Lambert (UK) 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 Mathieu (France)</p>
<p>Jacobs and Hardygen fought in the heat, and the two sides showed very different hitting styles. Jacobs served and chopped with great force, but Hardygen used the women's hitting style of 23 years ago, which was fast and extremely reliable for downward forehand shots, but useless for backhands. The same was true for her volleying. Hardygen won five or six games in the first set and one or six games in the second set. The game was over in just 35 minutes.</p>

<h3>Swimming Training Class Has Enthusiastic Participation</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese Swimming Research Association adopted a cooperative organization, the progress has been smooth. The renovated Lanyuan Swimming Pool on Maiersi Avenue in the French Concession has been renamed Wanguo Swimming Association. The building is entirely made of cement, the water is changed every other day, and it is open 18 hours a day. Instructors are on duty to provide free training. It is heard that anyone has the possibility of learning to swim in one session. Any official member of the association can enjoy three months of swimming rights by presenting a receipt and a two-inch photo and paying only one dollar for miscellaneous fees. Non-members who participate temporarily can purchase a long-term ticket from today until October 1st for only eight yuan. If there are more than 18 people in a group, school, or organization, there will be flexible arrangements. It is heard that the office is still located on the second floor of No. 115 Hankou Road (formerly No. 9). The association's phone number is 13734. More than 100 people have registered in recent days, and more than 30 people have temporarily participated. The quota is limited, and those who hesitate may miss the opportunity.</p>
<h3>The East Asia Swimming Pool Has Been Greatly Renovated</h3>
<p>A Separate Women's Bathing Room and Changing Room Have Been Added</p>
<p>Water Is Changed Every Day on Saturdays and Sundays</p>
<p>The East Asia College of Physical Education in Lujiawan in this city built a swimming pool, originally for the use of students to practice. During each summer vacation, the number of students staying at school is small, so the school makes use of it to provide it to the public. Ladies who love to swim go there to practice, which is quite enthusiastic. It is heard that the school's usual practice time for male and female students is separate, so there is no need to separate bathrooms and changing rooms for men and women. When it is open to the public, it is difficult to divide the guests. But this year, there are many female guests, so a separate women's bathing room and changing room have been specially added. It is also heard that the pool usually changes the water every other day, but on Saturdays and Sundays, it changes the water every day. The clear water is clear and the facilities are perfect. Those who are interested in swimming, why not go?</p>
<h3>National Goods Bank Team's Lineup for the Liuh River Competition</h3>

<h3>Selective Issues</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhiban</p>
<p>Line A Discussion</p>
<p>There are many radio stations in Shanghai, and the frequency differences are extremely close. At the same time, the transmission power is medium to low. In such a harsh radio environment, it is not easy to separate clearly and output strongly. Most amateurs are at a loss and deeply feel the pain.</p>
<p>Speaking of superior selectivity, the super-heterodyne circuit is the best, but this kind of circuit is not easy to make by oneself, and it requires high-end testing equipment. However, the value of high-end testing equipment is often much more expensive than the radio itself. Even super-heterodyne circuits require four or five vacuum tubes or more, which is not in line with the economic conditions of ordinary amateurs. Furthermore, the output efficiency of super-heterodyne circuits is quite low, which is not cost-effective.</p>
<p>Adding more radio frequency amplification stages is also uneconomical, and the selectivity may not be superior. Adjustment and complex poles are difficult. Moreover, radio frequency amplification, used in general circuits, should not exceed two or three stages, otherwise the detection stage will be overloaded and damaged. In fact, radio frequency amplification has great effect on sensitivity. In terms of selectivity, although its filtering effect can be utilized, the results are very limited.</p>
<p>For economical radio reception in the Jiangzhe area, using a single-stage tetrode regenerative strong detection and a single-stage pentode strong amplification, or a two-stage triode audio frequency amplification, seems to be the most reasonable circuit. For radio reception in the Jiangzhe area, adding another stage of tetrode radio frequency amplification is sufficient. However, the biggest disadvantage of this type of circuit is that it is not clearly separated. Several relatively economical methods of increasing selectivity can be divided into several types:</p>
<p>(1) Preselector</p>
<p>(2) Loop Antenna</p>
<p>(3) Public Line Key Control</p>
<p>(1) The role of the preselector is as a filter, placed between the antenna and the radio. Whether the selectivity is superior depends entirely on the quality of the preselector design, but the adjustment is quite complicated, and the work is not very reliable. For a more suitable circuit, please refer to pages 45 of Volume 10, Issue 1 of China Wireless [Article on the installation of a four-purpose selector].</p>
<p>(2) Loop antennas use the directional properties of loop antennas to replace matching harmonic coils, which can increase selectivity, but the signal strength is reduced, so it is not a perfect method. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Radio Phonograph Connector</h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>In addition to receiving wireless radio music, if a pickup is added to the radio, it can also play gramophone records. Today, radios equipped with pickups are connected to the detection circuit. For superheterodyne machines, it is in the input circuit of the second detection stage, but this connection method has three major drawbacks: first, only a small portion of the audio frequency amplification works in the radio, and the rest, such as the high-frequency amplification stage, intermediate frequency stage, and oscillation stage, are completely ineffective. Therefore, not only is a large portion of the power consumed in vain, but it also damages the life of the vacuum tube, which is very uneconomical. Second, because only a small portion of the audio frequency amplification can be used, the effect is minimal. Except for a few high-end radios equipped with strong audio frequency amplification, which can activate the loudspeaker, the rest of the slightly inferior radios cannot be used. Third, adding a pickup plug inevitably lengthens the lead wire in the detection stage, which often causes unnecessary oscillations, causing unexpected obstacles to the radio.</p>
<p>The connector described in this article is designed entirely to eliminate the above three difficulties. Its basic principle is no different from a small broadcast transmitter. The circuit is extremely simple, using a 43 high-frequency pentode as the oscillation tube. The oscillation frequency should be matched within the broadcast frequency range. The coil S can be wound with 28-gauge wire in 100 turns on a 2.5-inch diameter plastic tube, with a center tap at 50 turns. Connect to the high-voltage positive electrode. P can be wound on S with 32-gauge wire, with a layer of insulating paper, for 25 turns. This coil must be isolated with a metal cover. S and 1 form a high-frequency circuit, one end connected to the vacuum tube screen grid, and the other end connected to the [missing character] electrode. The power supply can be directly taken from 110-volt AC power, without the need for a power transformer. A new type 25Z5 is used as the rectifier tube. The filament electrodes of the two vacuum tubes should be connected in series, and then connected to an iioY40W light bulb.</p>
<p>When using this device, first connect the two ends of P directly to the antenna and ground terminals of the broadcast radio, and then connect a wire to connect the control [missing character] to the cathode, as indicated by the dotted line at X. At this time, adjusting the radio can hear a sharp call at one point, indicating that the connector has generated oscillations. Then remove this line, and use the pickup (i.e., cartridge) on the record player to connect to the high-frequency oscillation energy output by the connector. The amplitude modulation effect is produced according to the audio frequency of the pickup. Therefore, the radio can hear the music from the record. The oscillation frequency output by the connector can be changed at will by turning C1. It is best to choose a quieter segment on the radio dial to avoid interference from other stations.</p>
<h3>The Making of Crystal</h3>
<p>— Qingxia</p>
<p>We who play wireless radio all hope to be able to do everything ourselves, and we are willing to even if the results are not very good. Crystal radios are the first good friends that beginners get to know, so I will openly tell readers how to make crystals so that readers can make them themselves. Now the market is full of hated AM-brand fixed crystals and active crystals. Are we willing to exchange money for hated goods? Let us make it ourselves and avoid being deceived by stores, who transform hated goods to exchange for our money. Anyone with a little public school knowledge can say the chemical composition of crystals. The ordinary crystal used is aluminum sulfide (PBS), and the AM brand is also this type. It is not difficult to make this kind of crystal. Just go to a pharmacy to buy some sulfur (Sulphur), which only costs about four corners a pound, and then buy some relatively pure aluminum (do not replace it with the aluminum of aluminum characters because the aluminum of aluminum characters is an alloy of zinc, tin, aluminum, etc.). Combine them together. However, these two things must be combined to form a crystal. It is not just a mixture of the two. To make a crystal, the sulfur and aluminum must be truly chemically combined, not just ordinary mixing. Now, first cut the purchased aluminum (such as the original block) into small pieces, and then mix it with an appropriate amount of sulfur. It should not be too little, but a little more is okay. After mixing, wrap it in thin paper. Then take a piece of mud (it is best to use magnetic mud, which is sold by industrial raw material companies and is light yellow in color and shaped like bricks, which needs to be ground finely and mixed with water), pinch it into a spherical shape, put the paper bag into the mud ball, let it dry in the shade, and then put it in a fierce fire. The longer the time, the better (the author put it in a coal stove for about a day) to ensure that it is indeed chemically combined. Take it out and break the mud ball to get shiny black crystals. If it is not shiny and becomes granular, it proves that it is not completely combined, so you must not be too hasty to avoid failure. Although this kind of incompletely combined crystal can also detect waves, the sensitive points are less and it is easy to break.</p>
<h3>Soldering Simplified</h3>
<p>— Fanghua</p>
<p>Soldering wires is an important task in making and installing radios. Many connections that are not soldered will soon have adverse effects: however, the soldering procedure is very troublesome, requiring a lot of tools and materials: the following method is very simple. First, polish the ends of the wires clean, wind them slightly a few turns, then wrap several layers of tin foil used for wrapping cigarettes, (adding some rosin inside) and place the wrapped area on an alcohol lamp to burn until it melts, and it will naturally [missing character] into a piece.</p>
<h3>Solder Flux Method</h3>
<p>— Guo Yongnian</p>
<p>Ordinary soldering of metals uses flux (commonly known as solder medicine), which is an acidic mixture, which is used for soldering wireless machine parts and joint connections. Soon after, the acid will gradually corrode the soldered area, increasing resistance. However, some studies have been done to buy prepared non-acidic solder flux, and the non-acidic solder flux manufacturing method is very simple, costing no more than four corners. Just buy a large piece of rosin from a Chinese herbal medicine store, smash it, and dissolve it in MothylatedSpirit. To be precise, you can buy it in Western pharmacies and chemical instrument stores, and just a small wine glass amount is enough. The manufactured solder is used in the same way as ordinary solder, but the copper wire machine parts to be soldered must be wiped especially bright and clean.</p>
<h3>A Crystal Radio Using Electric Light Power Cord as Antenna</h3>
<p>— Yingfu</p>
<p>For people who do not live in new-style flat-roofed houses, it is often difficult and annoying to install an antenna, because climbing walls and digging on tile roofs always feels dangerous. So using the indoor electric light power cord as an antenna is a very good method. However, the power cord is not always loud when used as an antenna, and a capacitor of different capacity must be used for each radio station received. For example, a certain radio station can be listened to very satisfactorily with a ○○○ two-five megameter, Farad capacitor, but some others need to use ○○ three and ○○ four megameter Farads.</p>
<p>The following is a device that uses seven capacitors and is transformed into twelve kinds of joints. The circuit and parts are as follows:</p>
<p>L is a common honeycomb coil wound with sixty turns of inserted type (other types can also be used instead). C is a ○○○ five megameter variable capacitor. C1 to 8 are all fixed capacitors: C1○○○ one-five [missing character] point Farad</p>
<p>C2○○ two-five</p>
<p>C3○○○ five·C4○○ one·</p>
<p>C5○○ two·C6○○ three·</p>
<p>C7○○ four·C8○○ two·</p>
<p>D Crystal·</p>
<p>S is a branch line key, but a Bakelite button must be used to avoid danger when adjusting these capacitors too quickly. The branch line key should be larger, so that it can contact two branch line nails at the same time, so sometimes the capacity of two capacitors can be connected together. For example, if the branch line key is straddled on C1 and C2, then a capacity of ○○○ four can be obtained.</p>
<p>If straddled on C6 and C7, ○○ seven can be obtained. In this way, seven capacitors can be transformed into twelve different connections.</p>
<p>The usage is also very easy: first connect the branch line key to C4, and then rotate C to find the radio station you want to listen to. After finding it, then turn the branch line key, or connect it alone, or straddle it on those branch lines, until the loudest degree is reached. When adjusting, you also have to gently turn C again.</p>
<h3>The Reason Why Crystal Can Detect Waves</h3>
<p>— RF</p>
<p>According to recent studies by physicists, the rectification effect of crystals is considered to be due to a thermoelectric voltage (ThermohhllelcuicelectromotiyeForce). The thermoelectric voltage is generated at the point where the stylus touches the crystal surface. This thermoelectric voltage has the opposite effect on the positive and negative sides of the external electrical signal voltage. Therefore, it can show a rectification effect.</p>
<h3>A Peculiar Loudspeaker</h3>

<p>Once the author installed a DC four-tube machine for a friend. The machine had one stage of high-frequency amplification, one stage of feedback-type detection, and two stages of audio low-frequency amplification. After the installation, the test effect was found to be not very satisfactory in terms of volume and sensitivity, and it also had a sandy sound. I accidentally discovered that the loudspeaker was not connected, so where did this sound come from? Later, after carefully listening and辨别, I discovered that the sound was coming from the second-stage low-frequency amplification transformer. This made me speechless! It turned out that there were two pieces of metal shell outside the sound changer, and the screws on the shell were not tightened. When the low-frequency audio current passed through the primary of the transformer, the sand steel sheet generated a magnetic field, and the metal skin of the outer shell acted as the vibrating plate for sound production. The volume level depended on the strength of the current output between the screen grids of the vacuum tubes. Later, when the screws on the metal skin were tightened, the sound disappeared. Investigating the principle of this effect is nothing more than a small loudspeaker.</p>
<p>Small Experiences</p>
<h3>丨Wiring Method</h3>
<p>— Manping</p>
<p>Using the coil made of very thin copper wire; such as transformers, loudspeakers, choke coils, and earphones, when the wire is broken, it is a very difficult task to re-disassemble and rewind the wire for young amateurs who do not have any mechanical assistance. As a result, one has to either buy a new one or send it to a repair shop to replace the coil. In short, this is an unexpected loss. In our laboratory, we also often inadvertently burn out coils. However, using the method described below, eight or nine out of ten can salvage the effectiveness of the broken wire. Use a high-voltage power source to connect to both ends of the broken coil, because the two wire ends of the break are very close, so the sparks and high heat generated on the two broken wire ends are enough to melt the wire and connect the broken wire ends. Some devices that generate high voltage use induction coils (lnductionCoil), or use the B voltage of the radio (must be 300Vfoov), but the power cord has too much current and cannot be used.</p>
<p>Now, let's use the power transformer of an ordinary radio as our tool. X is the [missing character] plate of the B voltage, and Y is the cathode after the current conversion (as shown in the figure). When repairing, you can connect the two ends of the broken coil to both ends of X or Y. The voltage of X is higher than that of Y. When connecting, you can use Y first, and if it cannot be melted, use the power of X (generally, Y is used to repair transformers or choke coils, and X is used to repair loudspeakers). The broken wire coil and the two electrodes of XY cannot be connected for too long, because after connecting, it will often cause other parts to break. Therefore, a key (Key) must be inserted into the circuit between the broken wire coil and the high-voltage power supply. When doing this work, all the vacuum tubes of the radio must be removed. If you use Y, you must leave the rectifier tube.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the connection once, you can repeat the connection several times. The voltage of X is extremely high, so you must pay close attention when handling it.</p>
<h3>Domestic and Foreign News</h3>
<p>Special News from Shanghai Private Dalu Correspondence School of Telecommunications: Shanghai Nanjing Road Daqiang Department Store, 3rd Floor, No. 319.

<h3>Finance The Strength of Major Players, Marker Price Recovers After Fall丨Final Decline Reduced to Four Yuan and Seven Cents丨</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a resurgence of the silver market's rising and falling trends, but major players, seeing the low prices, eagerly bought, maintaining a significant force. Public sentiment was normal. After rumors of the Central Bank opening at five yuan cash, the latter part of the situation saw stronger buying interest. In the morning, overseas silver markets in both England and America rose, and forward silver prices on the Five Metals Exchange rose by three to six percent. Exchange rates slightly shrunk for American cotton and American wheat rose by one and a half points. London raw gold rose by two pence, and stocks rose by one yuan, six jiao, and seven fen. Preliminary trading opened and immediately fell to 77.8 yuan, but with many sellers, it continued to decline. Rumors spread of American inflation and silver purchasing. After the opening, the situation was uncertain, with occasional rallies, and buyers were still active, showing a stable trend. However, due to prior knowledge that exchange banks listed British and American exchange rates rising by 1.25, there was still a downward wind. Later, the domestic market stabilized, and major players successively bought at the low prices. Banks, besides dealing with shillings, slightly bought forward US dollars, managing to rebound. However, banks sold near-term, and the gold market trended mostly sideways. The Dalian gang and others bought, leading to a wavering situation, struggling around eight yuan. Silver prices from the Seattle night market were reported at 25.25.25 and half a point, and although there was a slight setback, there were still many who maintained the low prices, managing to hold it up. The situation was unremarkable, mainly because Reuters telegraphed that the US Treasury Department would officially announce regulations prohibiting silver exports today. Speculator Wu sold his holdings, and upward momentum was lacking. The market situation was particularly stable later, with silver prices from the Seattle night market shrinking by 25.25 and rising by 25.25. Major players' buying interest was eager, leading to a rise. Midway, Bombay reported a rise of four annas, without much impact. Public sentiment seemed firm. There were rumors in the market that India was selling silver. The final outcome was the most favorable, with only a 2.5 yuan fluctuation from initial fatigue to later stability throughout the day. The price of red gold was calculated at 985.2 yuan and two jiao. It was heard that over a thousand bars of spot goods had arrived at the port. Currently, local inventory is estimated to be around 66,000 to 77,000 bars. The day's market situation is recorded below:</p>

Sen Chang, Yong Yu Qing Yong, Fu Chang Yi Cheng, Shun Mao Qian Chang, Xiang Da De Cheng, Chang Sheng Yong Ying Feng Heng Cheng Kang, etc., bought bars very eagerly. Banque de l'Indochine bought October US dollars at 75, gradually rising to 8.9 yuan. However, there were many wanting to sell at the 9 yuan limit. Goods Fu Xing Yong tended to sell off, retreating to within 8 yuan. At this time, because Yu Qing and Yong Wan Xing were still buying, the market was mostly sideways. Afterwards, Heng Yu Da De Cheng sold, and it retreated to 7.5 yuan. Yu Yong Ding Kang and the Dalian gang still came in, rising again to 8 to 8.5. The night market silver price rose 25.

The night market bank price rose 25 to half a point, also lacking much impact. Later in the market, due to news that the night market silver price had shrunk 25 and risen 25, banks slightly bought, but there were few transactions. Bombay rising four annas also lacked change.

<h3>Receipts Sparse, Interbank Call Loan Market Motionless</h3>
<p>Yesterday's financial market situation was extremely chaotic. All kinds of transactions mostly entered a state of calmness, truly an atmosphere of silence. This was caused by the economic downturn, and as a result, all industries are in recession, not just the financial industry. The foreign interbank call loan market price was 5% in both the morning and noon markets, without any movement for many days. Adding water to the float to match supply and demand resulted in purely white float trades. Interbank call note transactions were still declining. The amount of transactions transferred and new in the morning market was over 3.8 million, and in the noon market, transactions were over 200,000. In the Small General Association, transactions were over 500,000. Foreign mortgage transactions had redemptions of over 700,000 and new transactions of over 900,000. Bank receipts seemed sparser than before. Foreign banks' receipts of notes and payments were over 1.6 million, telegraphic transfers were over 300,000, and various goods exchange collateralized payments were over 3.2 million. Warehouse entries were 500,000. Chinese banks' receipts of notes and payments were over 2.5 million, various goods exchange collateralized miscellaneous payments were over 4.2 million, customs duties were over 400,000, and warehouse exits were 600,000. Japanese banks' receipts of notes and payments were over 1.5 million, various goods exchange collateralized payments were over 4.0 million, and warehouse exits were 300,000. Money shops' foreign public bill receipts were over 37.0 million, and foreign float payments were over 4.2 million. Various remittance payments were over 500,000, cash receipts were over 400,000, banknote returns were over 800,000, issues were over 700,000, customer route sources were 100,000, and expenses were 250,000. Furthermore, the total number of checks cleared by the local clearing house on the 6th was 11,183,939.6 yuan in silver dollars, including 7,855,601.4 yuan in silver dollars and 3,328,338.2 yuan in exchange transfers.</p>
<h3>Single Coin Reaches Four Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small foreign coins traded at 840 yuan in both the morning and noon markets, a rise of 4 yuan compared to the previous day's noon market. The volume of transactions was 3,000 jiao in the morning market and zero in the noon market. Guangdong small foreign coins remained at 729.6 yuan in the morning market, the same as the previous day. The noon market shrank by 2 jiao to 729.4 yuan, a difference of only 2 jiao compared to the previous day. The volume of transactions was 80,000 jiao in the morning market and 35,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins also rose by 1,000 wen compared to the previous day, each at 328,000 wen. The transaction consideration was 9,000 yuan in foreign coins, amounting to 29,520 strings of wen.</p>
<h3>Securities Speculation of Consolidation in the 96 Bonds Market Suddenly Rises, Strong Upward Trend Incoming Traders Absorbing Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Trading Closed at 5 PM</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange suddenly saw a special upward trend. Although market prices were high, incoming traders absorbed quantities without hesitation, and the upward trend was almost frantic. The environment had no so-called changes, but the strength of public sentiment was extraordinary. Since the 23rd tariff bonds were listed, because their selling price was above 80%, incoming traders were still numerous and speculated that consolidation in the 96 bonds was coming. Short sellers felt increasingly cornered, as if they had to wait for changes in the current situation, fearing that waiting would be like waiting for the Yellow River to run clear. Observing from various situations, short sellers had no chance for the moment. With pressure coming from all sides, their elasticity became more powerful. The highest prices were 61.9 yuan for salt tax bonds, 78 yuan for short-term gold bonds, 71.8 yuan for combined 6% bonds, and 79.7 yuan for demobilization bonds. These new high prices had not been seen since 128 bonds. Moreover, the combined salt tax and short-term gold bonds had probably never reached these high prices since their inception, rising rapidly and unstoppable. Judging by market prices, they had indeed reached a considerable level and should have a correction, but judging by public sentiment, there seemed to be room to spare. Today should be one of the most fiercely contested days for both long and short sides. Yesterday's experience showed that the first session started with an upward trend, initially moderate but becoming more intense later. The 22nd tariff bonds rose wildly by over one yuan, already beyond expectations. Speculators thought there should be a correction and sold a lot, but the front end of the second session seemed stable and still started with an intense upward trend. Combined salt tax bonds actually reached 75%, with no flaws in the situation. Besides large players selling actual goods and the correction being relatively large, there seemed to be no possibility of a decline in market prices. The result was a rise of several jiao to over two yuan, which was commendable and memorable. Although trading closed in only two sessions, it was already after 5 PM. The total volume of trading was estimated at around 20 million yuan. The result of the rise and fall is listed in a comparative table below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Industrial Stocks See the Largest Gains</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported yesterday (the 5th) that New York stock market, due to good business news, saw a surge. Electricity production reached its highest peak since March 1931, and second-quarter company performance reports are also predicted to be good. Holmes Stack Gold rose sharply to $421 after declaring a dividend of $1 and a bonus of $2. At the same time, the German political situation gradually stabilized and the Anglo-German disputes were also resolved, so the market was progressing. The steel century's weekly workload report was already expected, so it did not have a negative impact. However, traders were cautious in their actions, waiting for the management exchange's steps, so market transactions were still sluggish. Some people believe that since speculative companies have been banned, it is difficult for the market to be active. The small exchange also held up. The bond market was stable and US Treasury bonds rose. Several types of treasury bills broke previous highs due to increased bank appetite. Corporate bonds also rose. Foreign bonds were mixed. As for wheat, Canadian weather had improved, but the price rose slightly due to bad news from foreign fields. The total daily trading volume was 440,000 shares. Furthermore, according to reports from our agent, (securities) the market situation is firm and rising, but trading is still small, (cotton) the fluctuations are extremely small. The Texas state's weekly report was better than generally expected. The situation in other cotton-producing areas is generally good. It will be difficult for the market situation to be lively before the release of the July 9 harvest estimate, (rubber) the market situation is progressing strongly, reflecting the firm rise in Singapore and London. Industry appetite is quite strong and there are few sellers, (wheat) the market has risen due to long positions eating up. The prices of wheat and corn may be slightly higher. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Rumors of a Certain Factory Stopping Production, Buying Sentiment Rises Sharply in Post-Auction Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market was fatigued in the morning and rose in the afternoon, and the situation turned strong and beautiful again. However, the sales of spot yarn in the market were unusually quiet. It was found that all the different commercial associations purchased only fewer than 200 packages throughout the day, which is rare recently. However, it was heard that the Tianjin commercial association traded 600 packages of Japanese yarn. In the afternoon, rumors circulated in the market that a certain large yarn factory was reorganized, and there was talk of stopping work. Therefore, buyers became active, and the market suddenly tightened, rising by 1.5 to 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Yarn Rises by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Before the auction, although the American cotton market opened flat, the trading in the market was quite clear. Both long and short sides maintained a wait-and-see attitude. The prices of the different months fell slightly by 1 to 2 jiao. The situation suddenly tightened when the market opened in the afternoon. Rumors were extremely prevalent in the market, saying that a certain large yarn factory was rumored to be stopping production, which caused the buying sentiment in the market to suddenly tighten. Another piece of news was that the Tianjin commercial association purchased 600 packages of Japanese yarn. As a result, market prices rose gradually, and all months rose by 1.3, 5, and 6 jiao. The total volume of transactions for the day was 24,400 packages. It was found that Xin Cheng sold 800 packages, Chang Yu sold 450 packages, Da Feng sold 800 packages, Yuan Da sold 400 packages, Chang Feng sold 1,150 packages, Ren Feng sold 750 packages, Run Kang sold 750 packages, Heng Yi sold 600 packages, Tong Ji sold 500 packages, and Sen Kang sold 500 packages.

<p>Inland 76, Shantou 15, Jiangxi</p>
<h3>American Cotton Disappoints the Bulls</h3>
<p>The cotton market is flat because of the disappointment of yesterday's bullish sentiment. The market is expected to remain calm, with a slight fall of 1 to 2 pounds. The bulls have lost hope, but the buyers are still eager, and the amount absorbed has not yet been used up. However, more yarn factories are reducing or stopping work, which will naturally reduce the demand for raw materials.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Slightly Contains Phenomena</h3>
<p>The pre-auction cotton market opened with American cotton flat and slightly down 1 to 2 pounds, and the bulls sold in volume, falling 1 to 2 jiao. The afternoon market opened with the yarn market trending up and the cotton market trending up 1 jiao to 1.5 jiao, and bids reached the second and third plateaus. The market atmosphere turned tired and weak again, and the prices of the different months rebounded by 5 fen to 1 jiao. The total volume of transactions for the day was 54,400 dan.

<h3>American Cotton Production Smooth, Market Conditions Weak</h3>
<p>British and Indian Cotton Seem Slightly Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton futures initially rose due to favorable news from Liverpool, but weakened due to smooth cotton production and profit-taking. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged while futures fell by 1-2 points. British cotton futures rose by 2-3 points. Indian cotton firmed due to speculative buying and Japanese merchants' purchases. As a result, Bengal rose by 2 rupees and 2.5 annas, Oomra rose by 1 rupee and 7.5 annas, and Broach rose by 1 rupee, 1 anna, and 2.5 pies. (From our wire service on the 5th)</p>

<h3>Grains and Flour: Market Fluctuations Significant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened with a trend of stability followed by declines across all months. Chicago wheat prices rebounded by about 4-5 cents, and Canadian wheat was initially quoted at 4 and a fraction cents. However, with persistent hot weather and rising wheat prices, the current month's offering price was raised to 4 cents, and forward months also showed stability, although actual sales did not increase significantly. Major mills continued to release supplies smoothly, causing some market anxiety. Nevertheless, outside speculators continued to buy, and some Tianjin merchants also made slight purchases. Therefore, fluctuations were significant throughout several rounds of trading, with prices stabilizing after initial declines and subsequent rebounds. Ultimately, the final results were slightly lower than the previous day. Under the current circumstances, predictions are difficult, as major mills hold substantial inventories. If the volume of their releases remains unchanged, the outlook is less optimistic. As a result, the current month was down by 1 cent and 2.5 mills, August was down by 1 cent, September was down by 1 cent and 7.5 mills, October was down by 1 cent and 2.5 mills, November was down by 1 cent and 7.5 mills, and December was down by 2 cents and 2.5 mills.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Gradually Decline, Spot Market Offers 20,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures opened with a flat and sluggish trend across all months. Chicago wheat prices rebounded by about 4-5 cents, and Canadian wheat was at 4 cents. Although the local area continues to suffer from drought, supplies from inland areas have steadily increased after rainfall. In this time of rural hardship, the ability to hoard grain is limited. Furthermore, local merchants are generally conservative, and spot market supplies are difficult to match. Even hedging sales are not substantial. Therefore, buying interest has waned, and the market has gradually declined. As a result, the current month was down by 5 cents from the previous day, August was down by 4 cents, September was down by 3 cents, October was down by 2 cents, and November was down by 4 cents. High-quality spot wheat remains firm, while medium-grade wheat has slightly declined. Mill demand remains steady, and trading is active. Shandong wheat is offered at 3 yuan and 5 fen, Southern Suzhou, Bengbu, and Wuhe wheat at 3 yuan and 3 fen, Linhuaiguan wheat at 3 yuan and 2 fen, Jiangxinzhou wheat at 2 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen (second grade at 8 jiao), Xuzhou wheat at 3 yuan and 5 fen (second grade at 3 fen), Dahuangqiao wheat at 2 yuan and 9 jiao and 4 fen, Pukou wheat at 2 yuan and 8 jiao and 2 fen (second grade at 7 jiao and 5 fen), Wuhu wheat at 2 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen (second grade at 7 jiao), Yangzhou wheat at 2 yuan and 8 jiao and 7 fen, wheat at 2 yuan and 2 fen, Mingguang wheat at 2 yuan and 9 jiao, and Qingjiang wheat at 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 2 fen (second grade at 8 jiao and 6 fen). Fuxin took 60 bags, Fufeng took 10,000 bags, and Xinda took 4,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Hexia Rice Market Sees Rebound</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 merchants from various regions sourced rice. Merchant demand remained limited, only 400-500 bags. With increased market confidence, late-season rice rose by 1 jiao. Local shops also showed slight activity, leading to a market rise of 1 jiao. Duyang pointed rice and Yinbian rice saw increased tightness.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 21-22 boats arrived from various Hexia regions. Spot market demand was slow, and prices were called tighter in the early market. However, the market weakened later in the day, and market conditions remained stable. Baiyuan rice trading was sluggish, with high-priced rice barely holding its ground, while medium-grade rice weakened by 1 jiao. Yangxian Duyang pointed rice saw minimal merchant transactions, and prices showed a weakening trend.</p>
<p>Early thin rice prices remained stable.</p>
<h3>Merchant Coarse Rice Suddenly Rises by 1.5 Jiao</h3>
<p>Inland Areas Active, Prices Generally Increase</p>
<p>Yesterday, the merchant Xian rice market turned around. After the market opened in the morning, there was a sudden rush of supplies arriving on the market. Merchants from inland areas along the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway, such as Xiaoshi, Jiashan, Xitang, and other ports, inquired and purchased 40 bags of Hankou coarse rice, 1,500 bags of Shashi coarse rice, and 360 bags of Bengbu machine-milled Xian rice. As the stagnant market was cleared by the inland purchases, the market immediately rose. Local Fuzhou merchants, seeing an opportunity, followed suit and purchased supplies. Local merchants bought 1,300 bags of Xiaojiao rice, 600 bags of Ganxiang machine-milled rice and Shashi oil-extracted coarse rice, and Fuzhou merchants bought 60 bags of Chuzhou machine-milled rice. With the increased activity of merchants, the market immediately rose. Merchant coarse rice rose by 1.5 jiao, and other varieties followed suit by nearly 1 jiao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaoqing Landed Prices Soar by 6 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended steadily. The association set the price for #24 raw brown sugar spot at 19 yuan and 9 jiao and 5 fen, with the dock delivery price at 20 yuan and 0 fen and 5 fen. Dutch red sugar and Taikoo sugar remained unchanged. The local factory's Zhenyu #1 fine white sugar was at 18 yuan and 8 jiao. Chaoqing prices soared by 6 jiao due to overnight and yesterday's telegrams. Common Longjiang Qing sugar was priced at 12 yuan, and the aforementioned Qing sugar was at 13 yuan and 1 jiao. Including all additional expenses, the premium exceeded 5-6 jiao. Therefore, merchants uniformly refused to sell. Quanzhou white sugar was released in full yesterday, with higher grades at 16 yuan, medium grades at 15 yuan and 7 jiao to 5 jiao and 1 jiao, and common grades at 14 yuan and 6 jiao and a half to 5-6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Newly Arrived Haikou Twigs Open at Initial Prices</h3>
<p>The 130 boxes of newly arrived Haikou twigs that arrived on the Hubei steamer the day before yesterday opened at initial prices yesterday. Higher grades were at 14 yuan to 13 yuan, with slight reductions for lower grades. It is reported that another 400+ boxes were loaded on the following steamer and are expected to arrive next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Hubei and Hunan Black Tea Exports to England Rebound</h3>
<p>Since Hubei and Hunan black tea exports to England rebounded last year, production in these areas has doubled this year. When the new tea first entered the market, the Hankou market was quite lively. However, due to excessive quantities, tea prices have gradually declined. As a result, many shipments have been transported to Shanghai for distribution, but this has not reversed the downward trend. However, since tea prices dropped again last week to the lowest market levels, with prices opening as low as 34-35 yuan, its value is only equivalent to Qining floral-scented tea dust. As a result, exports to England have rebounded. In recent days, Jardine, Hsieh Ho, Jin Long, and China Tea companies have purchased a total of over 10,000 boxes of Anhua, Taoyuan, Gaoqiao, Changshou Street, and Yangloudong teas, and market conditions have been quite active.</p>

<h3>Free Talk: Another Discussion on Re-translation</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Only after reading the end of Mr. Mu Mutian's "On Re-translation and Other Matters, Part 2" did I realize that he was clarifying my misunderstanding. However, I feel that there is no misunderstanding, only a difference in emphasis. I advocate that the primary consideration should be the quality of the final product, regardless of whether the translation is direct or indirect, and regardless of the translator's motivation.</p>
<p>Mr. Mutian wants translators to "know themselves," to use their strengths, and to create a "once and for all" translation. Otherwise, it is better not to start. This means that it is better to leave a blank space than to plant thorns, allowing a good gardener to plant beautiful flowers that can be enjoyed permanently. However, while the phrase "once and for all" exists, "once and for all" events are rare. In terms of writing, Chinese characters are definitely not "once and for all" symbols. Furthermore, blank spaces cannot be permanently maintained; where there is empty land, thorns or weeds will grow. The most important thing is for someone to manage it, either cultivating it or removing weeds, to make the translation field slightly less chaotic. This is criticism.</p>
<p>However, we have always looked down on translation, especially re-translation. For original works, critics are generally willing to speak up from time to time. When it comes to translation, a few years ago there were occasional articles specifically addressing mistranslations, but recently they have become extremely rare. There are even fewer on re-translations. However, in practice, criticizing translation is more difficult than criticizing original works. Not only must one have a command of the original language that is greater than that of the translator, but one must also have an understanding of the work that is greater than that of the translator. As Mr. Mutian said, re-translating allows the translator to refer to several translations, which is extremely convenient because if one translation is questionable, one can consult another. Direct translation is different; if there is something one does not understand, there is no way to figure it out because there are so many books in the world. Perhaps this is one reason why translators are lazy, but it is probably also because their language skills are insufficient. It is even more difficult to criticize translations created by consulting various versions. One must be able to read the various original translations, such as Chen Yuan's translation of "Father and Son" and Lu Xun's translation of "Destruction."</p>
<p>I believe that the path to translation should be broadened and the work of criticism should be emphasized. If one only establishes strict standards, hoping to make translators more cautious, it may have the opposite result. Good translators will be cautious, but bad translators will still translate badly. At this time, bad translations will outnumber slightly better translations.</p>
<p>Finally, here are a few less important remarks. Because Mr. Mutian suspected re-translations, after seeing the German translation, he even determined that his own translation of "Tashkent" was a condensed version of the French original. In fact, this is not the case. Although the German translation is thick, it is because two novels are bound together, with the latter half being Vsevolod Ivanov's "Armored Train 14-69". Therefore, our Chinese translation of "Tashkent" is not abridged either.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from a Trip to Yangon</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>On days when I traveled in Yangon, and I had no place to play in the evening, and I felt very lonely, I would board a freight train alone to nearby county towns or villages, play until about midnight, and then take the train back. | This was my hobby, like other people's liking for cigarettes and alcohol.</p>
<p>Such a trip is of course very good on a moonlit night. Opening my tired eyes and looking out the window, the fields, thatched huts, and coconut groves... all slept soundly under the moonlight, slowly moving towards the rear. A kind of peaceful atmosphere, along with the cool breeze blowing through the train window and the scent of mud and grass, all struck my heart. However, even in the dark night, it is still not bad. Like the houses far and near beside the railway, a glimpse of lights appears, as if some sad eyes were secretly peeping at people under thick black hair. In short, in this way, the mood that had been dulled by business all day long would suddenly become refreshed and lively.</p>
<p>Travel is a spiritual bath!</p>
<p>The place I often visit should be Yongsheng County near Yangon. This is like an ordinary small county town, with Burmese wooden houses and Western-style cement buildings, mostly sparsely dotted, interspersed with common grassland and tree shades, the flavor can be said to be extremely fresh. Local men and women sit on the wooden steps in front of the house to enjoy the cool air, and the lines of light are projected on their heads from the beaded windows. Occasionally someone plays the gourd flute, playing a slightly sad melody. But when several people sing together, they seem extra happy, and in between, you can hear the sound of clapping to adjust the song.</p>
<p>There are foreign goods stores and hotels run by Guangxi people, halal restaurants run by Yunnan Muslims, and tea shops run by Indians and Fujian Fuzhou people, but there are no shops opened by Burmese people. This is not because the Burmese people are unwilling to do business, but they have always lacked the skills and commercial capital to do business. | This is almost the case with most indigenous people in Southeast Asia. If the power of commercial capital is bound to conquer farmers, then it is extremely natural for the Chinese to make a fortune in Southeast Asia. At the same time, because they only progress to the stage of commercial capital, no matter how powerful the Chinese are in Southeast Asia, they can only sit firmly on the chair of "comprador."</p>
<p>Sitting at an outdoor tea table in front of the store, sipping coffee, enjoying the cool breeze, and thinking about this kind of thing is very interesting.</p>
<h3>The Unknowable Man</h3>
<p>(Baudelaire's Prose Poem)</p>
<p>— Yunwen Translator</p>
<p>Who do you love most, enigmatic man, you say? Your father, your mother, your sister, or your brother?</p>
<p>I have no father, no mother, no sister, and also no brother.</p>
<p>Your friends?</p>
<p>The term you just mentioned, I still don’t understand what it means.</p>
<p>Your country.</p>
<p>I don’t know where it is on that high place.</p>
<p>Beauty?</p>
<p>I might be willing to love it, if it were an absolutely beautiful and immortal goddess.</p>
<p>Gold?</p>
<p>I hate it, the way you hate God.</p>
<p>Ah! Then what do you love, incomprehensible man!</p>
<p>I love the clouds... those passing clouds... over there, those wondrous clouds!</p>
<h3>Rest</h3>

<p>It is because they have always lacked the skills and commercial capital to do business. | Almost all indigenous people in Southeast Asia are like this.

<h3>Little Star and the Dawn Has Not Yet Broken</h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Mentioning the two words "Little Star," people will think you are talking about a concubine. Originally, this allusion came from the Book of Songs. Mao's commentary on the "Little Star" chapter of the Book of Songs, Zhao Nan, says:</p>
<p>"Little Star" means extending kindness to those below. The wife has no jealous behavior, and extends kindness to the lowly concubines, who are presented to the lord. Knowing that their fate has nobility and baseness, she can do her best.</p>
<p>This is an explanation of the "Little Star" chapter by Han scholars. Song scholars have not jumped out of the scope of this poetic saying by Han scholars, so Zhu Xi's commentary on the Book of Songs says:</p>
<p>The lady of the Southern State inherits the transformation of the empress, and is able to not be jealous and extend kindness to those below, so her concubines praise her in this way.</p>
<p>The new national scholar Mr. Hu Shi boldly created a new interpretation. In an article about the Book of Songs, he said:</p>
<p>The poem "Bright are the Little Stars" is the oldest record of the life of prostitutes. We can look at The Travels of Lao Ts'an to see how the prostitutes in the Yellow River region send their bedding to the store to accompany guests. Let's look at the original text again: "Bright are the Little Stars, Vega and the Pleiades. Make haste in the night!"</p>
<p>We see her carrying bedding to travel at night, so we can know what she is doing.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's statement is naturally novel and gratifying. However, how should the phrase "early and late in the public service" be interpreted? It seems that he did not think of it. Could it be that the prostitutes of that time had to work for the public day and night, and the ruling class still had to skim the oil of prostitutes?</p>
<p>Now I also have an explanation:</p>
<p>This poem describes the life of the people at that time who were serving in public office, or the life of low-level civil servants. Try translating as follows:</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Those dim little stars, there are three or five in the east. You have to travel in the solemn dark night, and be in the public service both early and late. It is really that fate is different from people!</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Those dim little stars, there are two called Vega and the Pleiades. You have to travel in the solemn dark night, and even carry the quilt and tent together. It is really that fate is not as good as people!</p>
<p>In the Book of Songs, there is also the poem "The Dawn Has Not Yet Broken" from the Qi State, which is of the same nature as this one. However, the former says that you cannot rest at night, and the latter says that you get up too early. Probably the higher the official, the less there is to do, and the smaller the official, the more laborious it is. It is even more difficult to be a small clerk in the government, especially the small common people who serve in the public service, and there is not much difference between ancient and modern times. Now I will write out the original text of this poem for comparison, and try to translate as follows:</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>The east has not shone, and I put on my clothes upside down. Never mind the ups and downs, the public calls me to be early!</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The east has not lit up, and I put on my clothes upside down. Never mind the ups and downs, the public has orders that are difficult to delay!</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Breaking off willow branches to surround the tea garden, muddled people do not observe this order. Unable to distinguish day and night, early and late, if it is not early, he does not want to be late! According to Mao's preface to the Book of Songs, "The Dawn Has Not Yet Broken" is satirizing the lack of moderation. The court and living are without moderation, the orders are not timely, and the Pot-bearer cannot perform his duties. This explanation is generally correct. Zhu Xi's commentary also adopts this statement. But I don't understand why the "Little Star" chapter is of the same nature as this poem, why does the poetic preface exclusively explain it as a poem about the lady extending kindness to the lowly concubines? It is only because the predecessors had such a misunderstanding that later generations universally recognized "Little Star" as a pronoun for concubines.</p>
<h3>The Swindlers</h3>
<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>Once I ran to Guangzhou and found my godmother, whom I had been separated from for two years. She had become even more kind and friendly, because her son—Fusheng—who had been a policeman for seven years, had just been promoted to police chief not long ago, so she had two shallow wrinkles of joyful satisfaction added beneath her nose.</p>
<p>The second time I went to her house, I ran into Brother Fu, who had inherited his mother's kind nature. Although he was a man in his thirties, he often made childlike innocent gestures. His slowly glancing eyes revealed a kind of distress bound by great contradictions. Listening to him speak, one would think about how comical it was for his weak nature to be intertwined with his savage profession.</p>
<p>"Ah, no wonder the brothers said: 'Eel Goby' have all jumped from Shunde to Guangzhou!" When he saw me, he said crudely and humorously with a kind of enthusiasm that had been tempered.</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth honestly! Can you introduce me to a small job? Anything will do..." I made my request to him.</p>
<p>"Not joking at all!" He became more solemn, "Of the two or three Shunde women who are pulled out of those hostels on the Bund every night, at least a dozen occupy."</p>
<p>He was silent for a while, swallowing his saliva, as if there was a small sore in his throat. Afterwards, he spoke volubly, telling me the following story.</p>
<p>"Guangzhou is so vast and so noble, as if Guangzhou is a big gold-lacquered box filled with honey. Doesn't that hungry cat want to sneak in and see what's going on? Turns out, it's full of women who can't find men, standing idly by the roadside, or waiting in hostels to be caught by you, drooling and staring outside rickshaw stalls, machine sewing shops, and weaving factory gates, with no business at all... The outside is indeed gilded, a deceptive empty box!..."</p>
<p>How could they want to push the responsibility onto us to cover up their illegal behavior? | | The police are like a camera with lenses on all sides, reflecting everything in society... Tell me, what kind of bad thing in the world haven't I seen at first glance? But how restricted am I by a uniform! Yes, I should curse my uniform! Once, around one o'clock in the evening, my brothers and I went to search a third-rate hostel, and ran into a big-eyed girl with a scar at the corner of her eye, and she was also from our hometown. This is really infuriating | | | At that moment, that thin patron frowned and threw out two five-yuan bills, one for me and one for her, and put on his long gown and left. The pigeon cage-like room was left with me and that big-eyed woman who was only wearing a set of underwear.</p>
<p>"Hurry up and get out!" I was afraid that my brothers would come in, and said anxiously to her. She ignored me, lay straight, and said wearily to me:</p>
<p>"I haven't slept well... But, give me that five yuan? I'll sleep with you for a while longer."</p>
<p>"Hey, do you remember who I am? This matter has benefited everyone, but now you're starting to act wild! Is it okay if I take you to the police district?"</p>
<p>"Whatever, as long as you send that five yuan to my mother for me. The old woman wrote, saying that she and her sister have had nothing to eat for two days... I beg you to let me keep you company and give me the bill. Is that a crime? You and your mother and sister at home won't go hungry. Have you married a wife? Really not married?..." She stubbornly said a lot to me. She firmly held my hand, which was holding the bill. I looked at the shining brass buttons and epaulets on my body, and I remembered a saying | | compassion squats under the feet of the law.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Vernacular Chinese</h3>
<p>— Han Bai</p>
<p>In the current stage of the vernacular Chinese debate, there are still many participants who, with a hesitant attitude, estimate the existence and value of vernacular Chinese; and even more people who are raising the banner of reviving classical Chinese to contend against vernacular Chinese. Needless to say, there are also many bystanders trapped in the bewildering kaleidoscope! Therefore, I have determined this topic: The Importance of Vernacular Chinese in China.</p>
<p>To solve this problem of great significance, we must first explore the driving force behind the emergence of vernacular Chinese itself. Because vernacular Chinese is not like the language of gods in *Investiture of the Gods* or *Journey to the West*, but rather like a son without parents. Therefore, to determine the importance of vernacular Chinese in China, we must understand the social conditions in China that gave rise to vernacular Chinese; otherwise, it would be like climbing a tree to catch fish, a futile effort.</p>
<p>The current society of China, in economic terms, means that national capital cannot resist the intrusion of imperialist commodities, thus shaking the self-sufficient economic structure that has existed for thousands of years, and the countryside is plunged into extreme panic. In political terms, since the Opium War, after the paper tiger was exposed, due to the distorted nature of economic development, it has been entirely a process of rule by command swords. In terms of the lives of the people, they are groaning under the iron whip of imperialist oppression and feudal exploitation. From this, we can see that China is in an era of rapid transformation. However, in this process of rapid transformation, it is necessary to mobilize countless millions of oppressed masses to the battlefront, but in order to make these soldiers thoroughly understand the tasks entrusted to them, they must be politically trained. In this way, vernacular Chinese can be said to have become a powerful tool for political training.</p>
<p>The importance of vernacular Chinese in China is because it can undertake the following missions:</p>
<p>1.  Opposing Imperialist Cultural Aggression: In China, in addition to political and economic domination, imperialists have never relaxed their cultural aggression. Just by looking at the entertainment of the people, it is not difficult to see that in storytelling, romances, folk songs, amateur troupes, etc., from cities to remote villages, there is a mixture of ideas of universal love, peace, and non-resistance disseminated by the YMCA, Christianity, the Holy Society, churches, monasteries, mission schools, etc., which are used as anaesthetics. Imperialists, to adapt to their political and economic rule in China, adopt these methods of cultural aggression to carry out enslavement education for the Chinese masses. Pastors, priests, and evangelists, bearing the cross of universal love and possessing a distant expeditionary force, penetrate factories, working-class districts, and even Miao tribes in rural areas to build fortresses against new culture and anaesthetize the consciousness of the backward masses. This is an ironclad fact! Therefore, vernacular Chinese, which is rich in excellent qualities, is a tool for sweeping away imperialist cultural aggression. 2. Eradicating the Poisonous Remnants of Feudal Culture: The language style currently circulating in China is filled with elements of feudal consciousness everywhere, especially among the general upper-class Chinese and the remnants of the Qing Dynasty. Their words and deeds fully represent the doctrines and thoughts of Confucius and Mencius, and the dogma of justice and morality. The language of the lower classes, in their ears, is considered very contemptible. Needless to say, language also has class distinctions. The class representing the interests of a small number of people, of course, wants to use every means to preach to people with backward consciousness. As a result, the general working masses' awareness of life and their observation of social phenomena, in short, their worldview and outlook on the universe, are directly and indirectly affected by this kind of preaching. What a dangerous symptom this is! Vernacular Chinese is a tool that uses the interests of the vast majority to eradicate this kind of regressive language.</p>
<p>2.  Facilitating the Training of Masses with Backward Consciousness: Illiteracy in China is densely distributed everywhere. About 80 to 90 percent of the people are as good as having no eyes. Therefore, to enable these future masters to obtain the desire for universal knowledge, vernacular Chinese is the best and most convenient tool. It can achieve the greatest results in the shortest amount of time.</p>
<p>Vernacular Chinese has become an essential food for the people in China, but the question is how to promote and develop it.</p>
<h3>Strict Enforcement Movement Against Old-Style Marriages</h3>
<p>— Ms. Tong</p>
<p>After reading the slogan proposed by Mr. Bi Yao in the twentieth issue of Women's Garden, "Strict Enforcement Movement Against Old-Style Marriages," I felt an inexplicable sense of excitement! In this age of semi-paralysis, the remnants of feudal consciousness have not yet been fundamentally destroyed but are still deeply rooted in this dark society. It is indeed necessary to put it forward, especially for our female compatriots, this is a matter worthy of concern!</p>
<p>Recently, the case of the nine women outside Anbei Gate in Fuzhou committing suicide by drowning due to dissatisfaction with their marriages, and the case of Ms. Shi Jihua, a student at Xing Su Girls' School in Hangzhou, also committing suicide by jumping into a well because her fiancé was illiterate, are things that we, who are even slightly concerned about social and women's issues, must not remain silent about!</p>
<p>Under this deformed social organization, up to now, the lives of women have not yet embarked on the path of human life. Although the empty slogans of women's liberation have already been sung to the skies, in reality, they have not rescued our female compatriots who are oppressed in hell from even one ten-thousandth of their true suffering, isn't that so? On the news, we often see tragic news such as "[So-and-so commits suicide due to dissatisfaction with her marriage]" or "[So-and-so sacrifices herself for love]," what role should we play? At least, in this era of transition between the old and the new, when all new organizations have not yet unfolded before our eyes, and the old system has not yet been fundamentally destroyed, what should we do? Dear female compatriots, everything still needs us to calmly and rationally handle it ourselves; we must first know that in this era of surging waves, it is only when we bring out all our strength to overthrow the old system, and then use our own strength to create a new path, that is our only responsibility. We should not shirk responsibility or be afraid of difficulties; we should rise up ourselves and find the light here!</p>
<p>We need to study the evolution of the marriage system from historical facts. Obviously, we know that in the past, male-female marriage was extremely free. Although that time brewed a kind of "[ceremonial intercourse]" system, it only sought the satisfaction of sexual desire but did not hinder social progress. They or she still lived in a happy circle, living a "[human]" life! After the industrial revolution, the private system arose, and monogamy and polygyny were established! At this time, men could use money to buy several women. Anyone who was slightly wealthy had to keep three or four concubines to decorate their façade. In the customs of many places, if in a crowded place, someone asked if a certain rich person had only one wife, the person being asked and those present would all feel that it was not very "[decent]" in an intangible way. This is enough to prove that polygamy is a luxury item for the rich. Here, we should pay attention to the fact that that kind of marriage system is not based on the feelings or love of both parties; they completely treat women as a kind of private property and slaves, using women to vent their own sexual desires. Everything is based on personal satisfaction and one's own desires. This is what is called an old-style marriage.</p>
<p>After the banner of free love was unfurled, everyone recognized that marriage is caused by the feelings of both parties, and that it is a combination that can be combined by common will. This kind of marriage cannot be obtained with money; it is purely based on the same feelings and all ideological requirements of both parties that they can walk the path of union. However, because of the deformity of the current social organization, the result is that many things have gone to an extremely strange path! And the male-female marriage issue cannot get a thorough solution. Many still abide by the constraints of patriarchal etiquette and religion, and regard marriage as a commodity. Buying and selling, the general corrupt parents who enjoy the remnants of feudalism, still want to treat their children as commodities, hoping to earn a large interest. Therefore, generally, the daughters who are sold into marriage often feel that they do not have the ability to break through this evil feudal thought and the unreasonable orders of their parents, and they are unwilling to obey the orders of their parents and the words of the matchmaker to marry a stranger, a man they do not want to be with, so the idea of ​​committing suicide arises suddenly! Here, we should more clearly recognize and admit; in the future, on the one hand, we should think of ways to passively carry out several large demonstrations of strict enforcement against old-style marriages, so that our female compatriots who have not yet fallen into this dead end will rise up to resolutely resist the buying and selling marriage of the orders of their parents and the words of the matchmaker; and on the other hand, we should immediately rise up, hold up the new banner, to overthrow the old feudal system, cultivate some healthy people, so that each of us can truly live in the "[human]" circle!</p>
<h3>Illness</h3>
<p>— Chen Yi</p>
<p>The scorching summer sun was baking the quiet hillside, and everything seemed to be panting with fatigue, except for the small stream, less than a丈 (a traditional Chinese unit of length) wide, whose water was still flowing gurglingly.</p>
<p>Leaning against the left side of the stream was a small, dilapidated hut riddled with holes, which was the legacy of A-Jin's grandfather. Although it was a house that was too dilapidated to be repaired any further, A-Jin and his grandmother still lived in this dilapidated house. They had no way to live in a new place.</p>
<p>A-Jin's grandmother was an old woman who was nearly sixty years old and still constantly doing laundry work. She always got up early every morning and ran to the staff dormitory on the mine to collect clothes. After returning, she waited for A-Jin to go to work before she went alone to work by the small stream behind the house. She kept working until A-Jin came back from work, when she stopped working to cook lunch. In the afternoon, she went to the house as usual after the whistle for the end of work to cook dinner. However, after she finished cooking, A-Jin still hadn't returned, which made her anxious.</p>
<p>From the mine to A-Jin's house was a straight path about three 里 (a traditional Chinese unit of length) long. Therefore, A-Jin's grandmother ran out and stood at this intersection, because at this intersection, she could always see the people walking from the mine towards here. At this time, she stood at this intersection, her heart always pounding. Whenever she saw someone running from very, very far away, she thought it was her grandson coming back, but as soon as that person got closer, she was disappointed, but she always asked the person, regardless of whether she recognized them or not, "Have you seen my Jin-er?" However, people always answered, "I don't know," which made her even more anxious. Although the sun at this time was burning on her head and back like a torch, and her clothes were soaked with sweat, and she was a little dizzy, she had to wait for her grandson, she had to wait for her grandson to come back.</p>
<p>It was already four o'clock in the afternoon. Those who were working were working in the mine, and those who had finished work had gone home to rest. Therefore, on this three-里-long road, it was so deserted that there wasn't even a dog. A-Jin at this time slowly walked out of the doctor's office on the mine with heavy steps.</p>
<p>It turned out that A-Jin had fainted in the mine just before the end of work.</p>
<p>"Your body is too weak, you should go back and rest for a few days, otherwise it will be too troublesome if your life is in danger,"</p>
<p>A-Jin was walking wearily at this time, constantly thinking in his heart about what the doctor had said to him in the ward just now. But he should rest when he is sick, but who will give him food to eat? This was a problem that A-Jin could never solve. He worked eight hours a day and only got five 毛 (a unit of Chinese currency) in wages, and he had to support another old grandmother. If he didn't work, would he still be able to eat?</p>
<p>A-Jin's thoughts became more and more numerous. He also thought of his grandfather and his father, who had both died of illnesses that could not be cured. After working as a miner for seven or eight years, was he going to be the same as his grandfather and father?</p>
<p>At this time, A-Jin's grandmother saw her grandson coming back from afar, but her heart was beating even more violently. It was not until A-Jin got closer that she was startled.</p>
<p>A-Jin's face had turned completely pale without any blood. He was breathing very rapidly and could not speak. His grandmother helped him into the dilapidated house.</p>
<p>"Jin-er, what's wrong?" His grandmother asked anxiously.</p>
