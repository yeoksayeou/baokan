<p>我國東南瀕海。自遼寗以至廣東。佔省凡七。海岸綫之長。逹八千六百餘公里。而沿海漁塲之廣。亦超出日本兩倍以上。水產生物。種類繁富。無慮三千有餘。蓋兼寒暖兩性而有之。全國漁民三十餘萬。其恃漁撈爲副業者。又不下百萬人焉。</p>
<p>漁業與國民經濟。關係綦密。無待煩言。顧國漁業年來因天災人禍重重打擊竟至奄無生氣。救濟之道誠不容不講究也。</p>
<p>第一曰。漁業行政之宜推進也我國數千年來以農立國，向不注意於漁業。縱有漁政。大抵爲正稅抽捐之變相。不知竭盡保護提倡之責。民國成立後。政府當局。雖迭有獎勵漁業及護漁緝盜等條例之頒布。然口惠而實不至。效力幾等於零。反之漁。稅與漁業稅之征收。則層出不窮。二十年三月。雖由國府明令撤銷。而地方陋習仍難全免。最近主管漁政之實業部。已漸知矯正積弊。着手改良。無如困於經費。仍未能多大發展。如江浙。冀魯。閩粵。三區海洋漁業管理局及漁業改進委員會。成立未久卽因經費竭厥。而歸停辦。停辦後。雖另在上海成立護漁辦事處然其規模。巳遠不若預期之宏偉。假若本年度中央財政預算。封實業部經費。所擴增。則雖護漁設備。亦無從改良。邊論其他。實業部近有在各省巿籌設漁業警察局。及向德國訂造新漁輪七艘之消息。凡此皆非鉅欵菒辦。然爲保障漁業及防止越界捕魚起見。則爲必需之舉。甚望中央能促其實現也。</p>
<p>第二曰。漁民借貸所制度之宜普及也。我國漁民。大抵困於經濟。又因漁業爲有節季性的事業。春夏漁汎期內尙可賴捕魚爲生。秋冬天寒魚絕。便須乞憐於富戶。聞其借欵利息。至少四分明知剜肉補瘡。而無可奈何。今江蘇上實等九縣。巳有漁民貸欵所成立。漁民借欵不取利息。准其分期攤還。法善意美。應加提倡。使其善及。</p>
<p>第三曰。水產敎育之宜改革也。我國水產敎育。已有二十餘年之歷史。天津。吳淞·定海·夏門·遼寗·等處。皆有水產學校。然除天津一所改爲專門學校外。餘均高級中學程度。學生極少。而經費拮据。設備簡陋。師資自由缺乏。又爲各校之通病。聞日本捕魚汽船之駕駛者。三分之一爲水產學校畢業生。我國漁輪。則以不學無術之漁夫濫竽充數。水產人材能學以致用者。反寥若晨星。此漁撈技術之所以不如人也。</p>
<p>第四曰。漁戶與行商之宜好意合作。也我國漁村之間。衝突時起械鬥血案。往往而有。而魚商之於漁戶。又巧立名目。抽收陋規。陋規之穏類不一而足。其普遍於各地者。曰扣規。特行於江浙者。有上海之碼頭。公川費等。定海乍浦等地之神捐。天打捐。鎭海之神及公川費。或則爲公然之勒索。或則藉神名而自肥。補救之道。關於政府方面者。厥在劃分漁區。禁止陋規。另置相當人員。負各區敎育指導之責。關於行商方面者。厥在體恤漁戶。自漁業合作之成敗當先以是卜之。</p>
<p>第五曰水產研究之宜提倡也。研究水產。爲發展漁業之要着我國年來。雖在山東江蘇廣東三省。巳有研究機關之組織。而因國家多故成效仍鮮。遂令本國異常豐富之水產。缺乏調查統計之研究。任人宰割侵奪而不自知。可憐孰甚。矧當漁業統制之呼聲甚囂塵上之會。尤非首先注意於研究調查不可。最近有人主張組織全國漁業調查所。由全國經濟委員會籌設之。誠要國也。　　第六曰日輪侵漁及日魚傾銷之宜嚴厲對付也。在我國漁業奄無生氣之局面下。最爲吾人所惴惴不安者。厥爲日人之侵略。日輪侵我領海。任意捕魚。偸捕所得。或先運大連。轉口來滬。或利用漢㚥。輾傾銷。冒充國貨。偸漏關稅。不惟害我漁民生計。抑且侵我國家主權。種種行動。實堪憤懣。日本農林省水產局有於昨今兩年大規模擴張海外漁業之計劃。其出動之漁船。不惟謀侵略經濟上之利益。抑且兼任偵察海面之責。以期造成有力之戰時情報綱絡。我國因地理之接近與國勢之不振。此後領海權與漁權必將更受侵奪。殆無疑義。爲保障漁民生計。及維持獨立國家之威權計自不能不嚴厲對付積極抵抗。否則不惟我國漁業前途。將永地無光明氣象。卽國民經濟。亦將更進而陷於萬刧不復之竟地。可斷言也。</p>

<h3>意德妥恊　對抗俄法集團　德自由置軍備獲意贊助　俄提訂保安約遭德拒絕　意首相有於七月答訪德揆說</h3>
<p>羅馬　今日意大利日報載有首相墨索里尼之喉舌蓋達氏所著重要論文一篇、謂意德兩國總揆在威尼斯之會晤、係由德總理希特勒突然發起而成、又謂德俄間之關係、近甚冷淡而漸成仇對者、佔兩總揆談話之重要部分、德國認法俄恊約含有敵意、故蘇俄於威尼斯會議之前夕、向柏林提議締結東方洛迦諾公約、由法國担保、並由波蘭·蘇俄·捷克·德國參加、但柏林認此項提議涉及集團政策、故於六月十三日拒絕之、該文繼謂德國確認軍縮會之結論、已使德國不受任何禁止性質之担任、而德國可酌視其國防需要、自由設置軍備、同時意國深信威尼斯所成立之妥恊、將使奧國恐怖主義漸趨衰落、意人視此爲趨向和平並對抗集團之一種步驟云、</p>
<p>現有一種謠傳、據謂意相墨索里尼爲進行其個人接洽之主張起見、將於七月間赴巴伐利亞邦答拜德總理希特勒、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>一般視綫集於法國　會議秘密終難窺眞相</h3>

<p>（巴黎）意德兩首揆在威尼斯會晤、兩方均嚴守秘密、以致此間人士對於此事、不能有何明顯之印象、一般人以爲有一事必已確定無疑、卽希特勒經墨索里尼之要求、已允許停止國社黨在奧國之恐怖行爲是也、關於軍縮問題、則一般人不信墨索里尼能使德國改變其强硬態态度云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>停止奧境恐怖行動　德人方面稱附有條件</h3>
<p>羅馬　威尼斯所成立之妥恊、意義如何　解釋不一、意人方面以爲德國將不復援助奧國境內國社黨之運動、而德人方面則謂此事附有條件、雖未明白規定、但國社黨運動之承認、常然列於條件之內云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>希氏一諾奧局可安　英報視爲有裨歐和平</h3>
<p>（倫敦）星期日出版各報對威尼斯意德兩巨頭談話之結果、在大體上表示贊成、因英國人士對於奧國問題、極爲憂慮、自威尼斯會晤之後、一般人顯然以爲此事可望結果束也、星期泰晤士報謂、兩狄克推多會晤之結果、自然有其重要之利益、希特勒所取得者、不及其所畀於人者之多、但此事殊不足異、因德國經濟困難情形日趨嚴重、而希氏在德國威望亦不似前此之隆也、意德當局妥恊之主要點、爲希氏允許尊重奧國之獨立、此事驟然觀之、似爲德國對意大利之鉅大讓步、但實際並無多大分量、因德國在奧國以外、有待於經營之事正復不少、希特勒氏之諾言、姑無論對德國有何價値、但由歐洲論之、實有重大關係、蓋奧國之紛擾、實爲歐洲不安之最大因素、有希氏一言之諾、則人心可爲之泰然矣、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意德障碍完全消除　文字恊定非所希望</h3>
<p>羅馬　今日斯坦拍報發表該報總編輯所撰一文、記載希特勒與墨索里尼所成立之諒解、非常詳細、據該文所述現在文字恊定、非屬可能、亦非所希望、惟所有事實上及理想中之阻碍、均已有消除、德國之平等地位必須達到、此層兩國政府府久已同意、迨德國之平等批位、經各國承認德國卽可重入國聯、德國在政治上、無人能使其永久受制、歐洲政局如無希特勒所代表之德國、卽不能有所進步、近來意德兩國對於奧國問題、意見時有不同、茲希特勒與墨索里尼二氏業已同意奧國必須獨立、故奧國當可重返於正常狀態、至多瑙河流域之經濟合作、亦經威尼斯會商而得解决云云（十六日國民電）</p>

<h3>駐俄德使辭職　因與外交當局意見相左</h3>
<p>（柏林）德國駐莫斯科大使那多尼、業已辭職、據此間外交界人士推測、那多尼之辭職、係因種種問題與德國外交部意見不合、充以波羅的海各國商訂公約一層爲甚、那多尼曾充軍縮會議德國代表、爲目下德國外交界中最負聲望之人物、在德國政界頗有勢力、此次辭職、外間似認爲頗有關係、風傳德國駐華盛頓大使路德氏、不久亦將去職、但此說可信與否、頗難證明、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）對於德國停付外債本息六個月一事、政府方面現似考慮兩種解决辦法、（一）設立抵賬機關、（二）對進口德國貨物、徵收一種特稅、以充償付道斯及楊格兩國公債本息之用、英國財相張伯倫曾亦有採用抵賬辦法之說、此事一旦實行、則法國自必採取同樣措置、但政府方面以爲法德兩國成立妥恊、非不可能、故寗願商得友好解决辦法、而不欲採取具有使人不快性質之片面手段、國務會議下次開會時、政府必將有所定奪、但一般意見、現似傾向第二種方法（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英主設淸算處　內部意見未一致</h3>

<h3>讀文學書的興趣</h3>
<p>（三）（續）</p>
<p>所謂興趣的突進，自然不是說它無因的致，陡然從天空降下的，也不是由於個人的靈機觸發，受了某一種不可知的感應而行的一種變化。它是受生活條件决定的。我們常常看見一個人的興趣改變得非常奇突，認爲神秘，其實，這是不足怪的，我們祇要看一看他的生活，就可得着解釋了。反之，如果我们要改變自已的興趣，也須得從生活方面先有了改變。</p>
<p>舉例來說，譬如一個人以前是酷好讀所謂純文藝的作品的，他對於應用文之類的文字認爲是非常凡俗，是不値得一入目的。他對於應用文之類的文字自然不會有興趣。但是，如果他的生活改變了，他現在不是文學者的生活，而是終日忙於案牘，寫宣言，準備演講稿子，草通電或者編講義，撰學術論文···等等，他這時不能不注意到這些方面的文字運用，他對於素來認爲凡俗的應用文不獨不會認爲凡俗，或竟陡然生出興趣來，因爲在日用上，卽會就應用文而言，也是可以顯出（天才）的運用的。在生活的一轉變間，就可看出興趣的突進。　　有些人，因爲生活上受了巨大的刺激亦可現出興趣的突進。譬如研究日本問題，在九一八以前祇是少數年者個人的興趣罷了。但經過（九一八）（一二八）後研究日本問題的興趣是大大的擴大了。好多平日只讀文學作品的人，現在也來考察日本的財政了。我們又常常看見許多在事業是上遭巨大失敗的人，或者在骨肉間發生了空前慘變的人，一時都轉入唸經學佛一方面去，雖然在平日他們有的還是反對宗敎的，這時他們却對於宗敎生出興趣來了。這自然也可算到興趣的突進一方面云。</p>
<p>還有，富裕的人與貧窮的人的興趣，也常</p>
<p>常因富者變貧，貧者變富，連興趣也改變了。我們常常看見某甲發了財看不起某乙了，某乙非常的忿恨，覺得我們原是一道的人，何必有了幾個「大」就這般使人難堪呢？其實，造成某甲看不起某乙的，倒不是某甲而是某甲的生活條件、因爲生活富裕了，對於貧窮時代的一切就感覺無聊了，在這貧富轉變間就要一時的顯現一種興趣的突進的現象。</p>
<p>這種例子多得很，實在舉不勝舉。現在再從反的方面說，就是如果自已覺得要研究文藝理論，而在興趣上又讀不下去，心中極端希望興趣上來一回突進，我們知道這要在生活方面先謀改變，這種人工的改變是否可能？它不是一種幻想麼？</p>
<p>自然，生活的變化引起興趣的突進是沒有問題的了。人工的改變興趣是否可能呢？我們認爲是可能的？因爲人是具有能動的性質的，他並不是一具機械，一點意識的行動也沒有。就上面舉出的文藝理論的例子說，你知道應研究，却不感覺興趣，要改變這種興趣必然要經過以下的過程。卽要對文藝理論有了解，先要習相當的社會科學，有了瞭解社會現象的基本工具，而後纔有能力認識藝術的現象，纔能生出對文藝理論研究的興趣。所以，在生活方面你應造成許多對社會科學生出興趣的條件。對社會第一事變應隨時的去留心，分析觀察，在這觀察中你自會感覺自已能力缺乏的，由這缺乏之感，就會引你走到社會科學的學習方面去，由實踐的需要會生出研究的興趣，祇要達到這一步了，你進而對於文藝理論的興趣就會生出突進了。這一切都是可以由人工而可促成其改變的。</p>
<p>（突進）在形式上好似是偶然的。上面已經說過，（突進）也是有因果關係的。人的行爲必然要受客觀的因果法則所支配，但它並不是宿命論的，因爲人的行爲同時可是意誠的，可以由意識的加以改變。我希望顧李二君對於文學的研究上，不僅要注意到「漸進」的原則；尤其應不忽略「突進」，不忽略意識的加速這「突進」的實現，使兩位讀文學書的興趣「突進」到更前進的階段。（完）</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>有的就用上面本有臘梅花的花樣織着的綢緞來做衣服；有的是在素色的綢緞上，另行雇工把臘梅花繡上去的；有的或用金綫和絲綫合繡的，這都要看穿的人的地位和經濟能力而定了。太后或皇上是决不干涉的。還有一班更窮苦的女人，雖然無力置備這樣精美的東西，但亦必盡力倣傚，以爲能夠倣做到近一些，便是更榮耀一些；祇求花式相類，那末原料的貴賤或美醜，自可不成問題了。然而總有一個缺陷是窮人所無法彌補的，那就是皮衣！</p>
<p>到了春季，棉衣服和夾衣服便先後的穿起來了。春天的衣服上是照例總有牡丹花織繡着的。牡丹花在中國，有花王之稱，可算是有花中最富麗華貴的一種。因此那些美貌婦人在春天穿上了這些滿繡着牡丹花的衣服，便格外的嬌艷了！而且花樣雖然規定，衣服的顏色却儘可隨各人的便，於是每個女人都盡量的選用顏色最鮮艷的衣料。這樣打扮起來，她們自已就像一朶牡丹花一樣的美了！及至春去夏臨。凉爽的紗衣服便應運而興；這時候，衣服上的花樣，也不約而同的改爲荷花。到秋天，厚綢或厚呢的夾衣，和各色的菊花又替代着紗衣和荷花而出現了。一年，一年，永遠是這様輪轉着。</p>
<p>在一年四季中，有錢的官太太們是天天打扮得像彩虹一般美麗的；就是那些較次的官員的妻子，也决不肯過於随便，總得盡其所有的打扮着。打扮原是婦女們愛美的天性的表現，當然不單是中國婦女　如此！（六O）</p>
<h3>獨輪小車</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>時代的巨輪，不停的轉着；各種交通的器具，也由畜力，人力進而爲機器了。不過上海的馬路上眞奇怪，二十世紀式的摩託卡，風馳電掣般的駛着；而十八世紀的獨輪小車，還是伊唖伊唖的推着行走。那車夫兩手握着車槓，幾百斤重的東西，都靠着這蠻牛般的膂力而前行。熱天不必說了，便是在冷天，我看看那車夫，披着一件單衫，敞露着胸口額上的汗珠，像雨點般滾下來；急促的呼呼，好像上氣不接下氣。這眞是一件喫力的事情！不過他們爲了吃飯，爲了不能卽時改行，祇得拚了汗血，拚了力氣兜攬了幾百斤的貨物推着，和那運貨汽車竸爭營業。</p>
<p>那小車一様也可以載人，不過在現今的，租界上是難得見的。在從前絲廠未倒閉時，黎明和黄昏，常看見七八個繅絲阿姐，合坐一輛小車，車槓上掛满了</p>
<p>飯籃飯孟；不少的浮滑少年，跟在車後，品頭評足，謔浪笑傲。這也是上海洋塲風景之一，諸位也許見到的吧！</p>
<p>上海的四鄕，像浦東、吳淞，江灣一帶，仍有這種小車兜攬乘客。那車子比較上海装貨的乾淨一些；而且兩旁也舗着一個破坐墊。不過坐不慣的人，多坐了第一要脚麻；逢著崎嶇的路。臂部也顚震得發痛。諸位倘使不信，不妨到那裏去嘗試一下。</p>
<p>在汽力電發逹的時代，這種不人道的小車，理應在廢除之列。不過我們是經濟落後的國家，這些小車夫的出路在那裏呢？</p>
<h3>亭子間作家傳</h3>
<p>— 沈馨</p>
<p>亭子間作家，是一個年靑的人，他有白白的臉，紅紅的唇，漂亮的西裝，閃光的皮鞋，走起路來很神氣的。</p>
<p>從這位亭子間作家一切上，使我知道亭子間作家，並不是眞吃大餅，穿破衣生活的，瞧亭子間作家，不但衣服漂亮，並且出入，從不肯徒步而行。</p>
<p>作家有一次告訴我，他一部大作，從十六歲寫到現在二十四歲，還沒有完成。</p>
<p>記不得是那天，亭子間作家邀我去談話，在下，因爲還未曾到過作家的房間中，於是卽刻駕臨，趁此可以觀光一下。</p>
<p>那裏知道，不進去猶可，進去了令我奇怪，作家的房間中一切，和作家行動，完全不同。作家身上漂亮的，作家房間中却卑陋的，作家行動高貴的，作家房間中却雜亂的。</p>
<p>待我一走進去，作家很客氣的呌我坐，又呌我喝茶，半天，作家才開口說話。</p>
<p>作家說的話，眞使我莫名其妙，呆了</p>
<h3>民族自强不息</h3>
<p>半個鐘頭，嘴裏才回答作家：「何苦呢，女人是要金錢才能得到，否則任何怎樣大本領。」作家聽了後，點點頭，還流了幾滴眼淚。</p>
<p>誰知那天後，作家有三天沒出門，早嘆息，夜嘆息，不是哭，便是睡，不是睡，便是哭，閙得四隣暗暗的駡他，作家也許醒悟了，又像從前一樣出外，衣服也像從前一樣漂亮。</p>
<p>最近，作家的面孔上，浮上一絲笑容，在亭子間中，朝唱「妹妹我愛你。」夜唱「桃花江上美人多。」而且見了住在一屋裏的人，正眼也不情願瞧一瞧。</p>
<p>是爲「亭子間作家傳。」</p>

<p>便是這一道，也不能减除這種困之找了許多名稽秫乾樹葉子，在挖壕的綫上，點着火燒了起來，燒得地暖了，土鬆了，趁着這一點機會，立刻舉起鋤子就挖了下去。自强所帶這一連弟兄在這種困難情形之下，挖了大半天，　倒也挖有五尺深五丈長的一道壕，到了這個限度大家筯疲力盡，實在不能再挖了。自强依然舉起了鋤頭向下挖着，面前堆了一大綱稭秫，在凍風裏，冒出搖撼的短火苗，簇擁着濃黑的烟霧，那烟霧帶了烟灰，只管向人臉上撲去。自强除了满身都是烟灰而外，而且臉上的鼻涕眼淚紛紛的向下流着，不成一個人簡直受作一個鬼了。但是他依然舉了鋤子，陸續的工作。這些弟兄們雖上累够了，可是看到連長這様的賣命努力，大家也就不能不咬着牙跟了他後面工作下去。一直到了下午四五點鐘，還是寶芳派了傳令兵將起自强呌止住了，讓他到營部裏去聽話。寶芳見着他，帶了笑容點頭道起連長你這人賣在是很忠勇的。不過我們在要知道輕重。現在把力氣出盡了，回頭敵人攻來，又没有力氣來抵禦了。我要再挖一道壕，無非是想對敵人的唐克車再加上一層困難。可是我們後面還有兩道壕？先對付着罷。這時，你帶了弟兄們去休息。晚上咱們有事情幹。說着，他臉上帶着微微的笑容，好像在那裏說，繳倖得很，居然今天晚上可以開火了。自强在野外挖壕的時候，人站在烟火邊下，薰得身上臉上，都有些技熱僅僅是兩隻手，比較冷一點。作一會子又兩手握握揉揉，也就暖和了。（四一一）</p>

<h3>佘山小記</h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>五月的佘山，正和三月的蘇杭有同樣的熱鬧，在上海，也許是距離不遠，遊佘山沒有上杭州那樣的麻煩，所以那些有閒階級，便會陸續的到佘山去遨遊。這一次我雖然不是有閒階級但爲了要換換空氣，說得高興，也和幾個朋友到佘山去跑了一躺。</p>
<p>由上海到佘山，先要坐火車到松江，再換小船坐到佘山，雖是十二里路程的相隔，但坐在鷄蛋一般小的紹興船裏，脚伸不直，頭挺不起，好比坐了兩小時的牢監，這裏坐船生活，也</p>
<p>是別苦味，坐在船裏，有時談談天，有時看看野景，由裏枯黃的麥，嫩綠的秧，相映在靑天白日之下，自有一種自然的色彩。</p>
<p>在靑水綠汲之中，船，大船，小船，汽油船，一隻隻的浮向佘山去，好容易過了兩小時的坐監生活，才到達佘山，老遠看去，三年不見的佘山，面目依然如故，混圓的山頭揷滿了鬱葱靑脆的樹木，在樹木之中，隠約的顯露出幾所白色的洋房，還有一所高高的塔尖，隠蔽在叢林之中。</p>
<p>打船裏爬出來，踏上了岸，因爲山前的河流之中，已停得到處是船隻，水路早已阻塞了，所從你要到山前嗎？那非得要走一段路不可，高低不平的泥路，怪是難走，路旁的住家，都在探出了頭看我們走過，幾個轉灣，走了一里多路，才到達了前山，在山門口，到處是臨時的攤賄擺着攤頭販賣東西，人正在一批批的軋上山去。</p>
<p>山道是非常富闊路面新舗着一層黄沙，走了一段平路，有一段石階，祇有十幾純，所以爬山不見吃力，比杭州的靈隠天竺好走得多。兩面靑竹和綠樹已遮得使上山的人抬頭看不見天日，到了中山，旗，傘，滿處在飄搖，紅綠燈，紙綵，點綴在綠樹靑枝之中，一所高大的敎堂，敎徒在裏面祈禱，誦經的聲音，傳達到山谷的全部，一路有幾個神像，彫塑在叢林和削璧之中。</p>
<p>欲窮千里目，更上一層樓，到了中山，天然要到山上，這一段的山路，沒有下面的寬闊，傾斜的程度，也比較厲害一些，所以難走得多，等到爬上山項，我們都在氣喘吁吁了。到了山頂，一所在建築中的敎堂，依舊還沒有全部的完工，後面是天文臺，好像饅頭形的一個屋頂，矗立在山巓，遠遠地可以望見，好比是佘山的標誌。</p>
<p>這是正午初過的時期，大陽在西南角斜掛着，立在山頂，有意無意的向四面一望，江河的交叉，阡陌的縱橫，形成了一幅鳥瞰式的圖畫。向遠處望去，四周祇是灰黑的一圈，但黃浦江的水形成了一條白綫，大上海的烟煤圑做一天灰黃，在隠約中也可使你辦出。</p>
<p>我們在山頂上眺望了一會、便從另一面下山，開頭是一個十字架亭，男女的敎徒，都跪在亭子的前面祈禱，誦經，這裏的路，更是平坦十得不覺得在爬山了，因爲是經摺形的綿接着，一共是十個轉角、每角子是一所亭子，亭子</p>
<p>裏彫着天主十次象難的形像，所謂苦路亭，敎徒上山，在每個亭子的前面，要跪拜一回，祈禱一次。</p>
<p>下了山祇見山面前的河裏，停滿了船隻，七橫八堅，大小齊備，依着原路回去，走過一家小酒店，覺得已是飢腸轆轆，使走進去點了幾色菜，吃一頓飯，三個人祇耗了一千多錢，比上海便宜得多，鄕村生活比都巿生活究竟還低落不少，坐船回到松江，已是傍晚的時節，爲了有親友的邀留，便在松江宿了一宵。</p>

<h3>醫家病家涉訟原因之研究</h3>
<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>挽近醫家與病家。涉訟案件。接踵而起。以普濟爲懐之醫師。與信仰來診之病人。不能兩維其旨。而演成相見法庭之惡果。可謂社會間。大不幸事。說者。以爲道德旁落之一徵。而予意。世局之構成。决不如此简單。其間除極少數確有正當理由者外。約可分作七個原因而推究之。</p>
<p>（一）關於契約的誤解　醫學。已陷職業之窮境。而拘束於法律下矣。乃不能逸權利義務相當之對稱原則。至於成立契約形式。然此契約。與貨物交換原則。完全不同。係一方履行技術義務。與一方履行相當報酬之一種結契。其目的物。係技術。而非技術後所得結果。故醫不能保險病人生命。爲世界古今通例。蓋人係生活體。病非固定物。絕不能與修理機件。同一解釋。同一處置也。今社會間。往往誤解此意。以爲病之就醫。其目的固在求病之愈。而不知醫之義務。不在病之愈不愈。而在履行技術之當不當。設以病不愈。卽爲醫未能履行義務。而申異議。要請治罪。則醫家。不可不悉由生命保險公司支配之下。以治疾病。簡言之。絕無把握之疾病。或衰弱這身體。只能不予保險。不承醫治之一法。聽其自然而已。然而今日生命保險公司。猶且不能或免意外之賠償損失。此生活體這所以異乎尋常。而不能貨物機件目之也。</p>
<p>（二）關於感情的誤用　惻隠之心。人皆有之。然世人不能盡如墨子之兼愛。則勢必有親疎之分。而病人之與家族。與醫師。其間不能無關切之不同。其實醫師之治病。正不措鈎心鬬角。嘔血勞神以相向也。何以故。治病而愈。爲醫家唯一之樂事。唯一之榮譽。唯一之天職也。不幸而不不治。其中心固可無愧抑且同悲。世之醫家。當無利病人之死以爲樂者。而病家每一時誤於感情之衝動。忘春其環境。昧其眞理。為顧一切。而有輕舉妄動之涉訟行爲。卽不一敗塗地。亦必兩敗俱傷。在病家。以爲如此。始不負死者於地下。而實則誤解感情作用。無異醉後狂舞。供淸醒之途人作笑柄而已。</p>
<p>（三）關於一知半解之誤事　病人之病。惟醫家知之。治法。亦惟醫家知之。尤以親加診治者知之最詳。他醫。而不加意調查考據。猶且隔膜也。而於門外漢之病家。反謂能指摘你之錯誤。治之不當。可乎。觀歷來醫家病家涉訟案件。病家一方。每指摘醫治種種誤點。以爲入罪證據。以我輩觀。大都夏蟲語冰。絕少價値。其中雖亦有一二中肯之語。大抵已就正於他醫。殊不知病態白變。在主治者。猶且不能前知預防。往往因時制宜。隨機應變。以爲對付一時之救濟。我輩决不能以刻舟求劍。膠柱鼓琴。謂爲不易之理也。查過去之醫理爭執。病家大都失敗。是誤於一知半解。賣弄聰明。而致自陷也。</p>
<p>（四）關於同道的諉責。是非非。光明磊落。不必黨同偏袒。亦不必投井下石是方爲有道君子。血性丈夫。而三五淺識者流。每恐禍之及已也。爲急圖脫卸計。不惜設阱陷入。縱無挑撥之心。實有慫勇之行。病家一時惑於讒言。而輕易興訟者。屢見不一。此誠不能爲同界中淺識輩宥也。考過去一部涉訟事件。輙有不控死亡之處，最後之醫。而追訴初醫。或攻擊前說。以爲興訟理由者。按考此類事實。顧係當事之醫。爲卸責潔身之一種權術。而不惜陷同道於縲絏。不義不德。一致於此。良可慨也。</p>
<p>（五）關於金錢的追逼　上述契約形式上。病家之義務。卽爲金錢之報酬。而國人。往往誤解其旨。以病愈。爲金錢之代價。故不幸死亡。卽不願負此義務。而有不納診治各費爲對抗。俗語所謂人財兩空。心不甘也。若醫家根據契約。必欲使之履行。勢必各走極端。追上涉訟途徑。此類殊不乏例。尤以經濟狀况。不甚豐裕之醫病兩家。蓋一方不願放棄契約上之應有權利。而一方不堪再負金錢上之追加義務。勢使然也。</p>
<p>（六）關於職業的便利　涉訟。必需律師。關係宣傳。常賴報紙。故律師不化費用。而卽能草狀起訴。記者。得不必請託他人。而極易喚起輿論。對此兩項職業家病人。偶一不愼。卽易涉訟。徵之過去歷史。證據卽是事實。惟吾人不欲指摘其人其事。然亦有得此兩項職業人物爲背景。而自爲傀儡者。</p>
<p>（七）關於產敲詐的目的　病固需醫必需費。而國人習慣。醫藥費。從來並不列入預算。故臨時發生疾病。除有產階級外。大都須調度金錢。以爲挹注。然金錢買命。爲一般社會之心理。命茍未能買得。喪葬復不可無費。乃運其匠心。而轉向醫家。故每有病人死後。轉託人要求喪葬費不遂而致涉訟者。若病者已愈。醫藥費無所出。而構端敲詐。或嫉妬醫之名位。故弄威脅之詞。令出金錢。以爲洩憤地者。斯更下矣。至於禁閉醫家。脅迫署劵等事。乃無知階級之粗暴行爲、殊未足列入本篇範圍之內也。</p>
<p>嗟乎。世風日下。道義淪亡。前此者。如鎭江裔瑞昌之對汪元臣。本巿田鶴鳴之對兪松筠。杭州王雪飛家族之對裘伯壎。其最著者。然在醫理上。均缺乏立足點。而法津皆遭敗訴矣。是皆不由眞正之控訴理由。而爲上記七種客氣所乘。其敗也固宜。然而來日方長。精神衝動者流。世正不乏其人。往往平日明察秋毫。而偏不見前車之覆，乃仍不憚以身嘗試。添世間無聊之意外紛爭。費法庭無數之虛僞唇舌。其結果。一塲擾攘。仍等於零。彼此究有何益。或謂。此等案件。表面似皆以怠忽業務過失殺人等爲控告理由。其實背景。盡爲金錢目的。蓋非先得刑事上勝訴。則民事無從附帶發生。事茍然者。醫家對於對方刑事敗訴者。固未嘗不可控以誣告。追償直接間接之損害賠償也。鳴呼。儘耳目所及。國中類此之事件。正紛至沓來。而一幕當前。沈文達對葛成慧朱昌亞之糾葛又起。以久晦不明之社會。後此者。更不知暗中起落如何。深期忠實之同界。賢明之國人。公正之有司。淸介之病衆。幸勿迷於上列七種客氣之烟幕。而加以注意。加以研究。豈僅醫界之幸。抑亦社會之福也。</p>
<h3>藥物化學工業與國民經濟</h3>
<p>— 僅無</p>
<p>吾人日常之所需，舉其大者，衣，食·住，是也。乃以其文明之進步，則製作與改進日益複雜，質言之，凡百物品之成，間接或直接，不與莫化學有關焉。故今我國社會有識之士，鑒於外貨</p>
<p>充溢與國民經濟之衰落，輒以提倡化學工業相號召，此豈無因哉！</p>
<p>夫化學工業範圍至廣，茲乃舉其一都分之藥物化學工業，請爲言之。願同好者討論與研究之，以期進而爲工業之製造。其與民族自立之精神與國民經濟之補救，或亦有所裨益焉。</p>
<p>藥物化學工業包含有生活素（Vitamin）內分泌物製品（HormonPraparate），植物性藥物（PtlanzlicheAtzneistoff）化治藥物（Chcmetherapie），贗鹼質（Alkaloide），凝縮劑（Kcnerastmirrel），麻醉劑（ＮａｒｋｏｒｉｎｄＡｎａｌｇｅｔｉｈａ），强心劑（Ｈｅｒｚｍｉｔｔｅｌ）等，此種藥物各國均互相研究，從事改新與創造，以闢治療界之新紀元與增進國民之財富，孜孜不已，今返觀我國，凡爲化學製品藥物，盡爲舶來，卽舊醫所用之原植物，如陳皮，鈞籐，芍藥等，雖爲溫帶產物，亦以農業衰敗。據海關冊報告。由國外輸入頗多。其欲求生活自給，安可得哉！滬上雖有數家製造藥物工廠，限於經濟人才，僅爲製劑一途，如丸，散，膏，丹，水，酒之類，其實質之原料，仍仰賴於他人，長此以往，經濟之源泉必有告竭之一日，而遇國家有事，交通阻絕，外貨斷源，至彼時病傷之士兵與人民之疾害，必將坐以待斃！</p>
<p>其次家畜之傳染病之治療，特別牛，馬，猪，羊之類，關於國民經濟至切，舊時農民對於畜牧，祇憑天命，不究病之來源與已病之治療。其在科學未發達之時，尙足以生存；然遇有家畜之瘟斃，亦將累及家破人亡之凶報。如今國際竸爭頗烈，我之失敗，他人卽爲之占有。故家畜之管理，將必就改進之一途。將來所需治療之化學合成藥物，血淸以及接種苗漿。悉屬藥物工業之範圍。德國對於猪丹毒（ScbweineRotlaut）</p>
<p>，與豬瘟疫（ScbweinePest），用接種苗漿，以及馬之肺炎（Brustseude）之用九一四（Neusalvarsan），其數頗大。　　穀類疾病之冶療，爲化學家醫學家與生物學家研究之要點。此亦屬藥物化學工業之範圍。其有關於國民經濟之重要，可不待言。</p>
<p>水菓類經植物性與動物性之傷害，平均約有百分之三十。設吾人用適當藥物之治療，必可增加產量。德國經用有方法之治療後，每年增多水菓之價格，有一百五十萬萬馬克。</p>
<p>由上觀之，人類疾病之治療與預防以及農業之繁榮，有待於藥物化學工業頗多。吾人能分門研究，依次建設，我國藥物化學工業；其爲利之大，豈僅國民經濟已哉！</p>

<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識（三）衂血（續）</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>論到衂血的症候。本來沒有什麼特別的現象可講。一般人看見血液從鼻孔流出來的時候。就呌做衂血。不過因原因的不同。所以出血的情形。亦有不同。如由打擊鼻部來的創傷性衂血。他的流血在打擊後。立刻可以發生。鼻腔手術時之衂血。普通在手術後兩三小時最多。因爲手術時所用的局部麻醉藥。大部有局部貧血作用。此種作用不過二三小時。卽行消失。反來反應的充血而出血。在血壓增進的病人。或多血質的病人。衂血前往往覺得頭內壓迫感，頭重，眩暈，耳鳴等現象。或於劇烈的勞動或噴嚏後。也能引起出血。衂血普通從一側鼻孔流血。若多量出血的時候。血液也會經過後鼻孔變爲兩側鼻孔流血。有時一側鼻孔流血。他側鼻孔并不流血。但在鼻腔的前部。停留血液。這種時候</p>
<p>如要决定那一側來的衂血。常常發生困難，不過我們做醫師的。總有法兒來斷定的啊。說起衂血的出血量來。也很有趣的。就是出血量小的時候。血液爲點滴狀流出。多量的時候。爲泉湧樣溢流。此時血液常常流到咽頭。而由口腔吐出。或夾入痰中咳出。病人往往當做肺病的咳血。引起恐懼。若由咽頭流下的血液。不從口腔吐出。反而嚥下入胃。胃內血液刺戟粘膜。發生惡心嘔吐。有時血液可以從鼻咽腔經過歐氏管。（此管是鼻咽腔和中耳交通的一條道路。）流入中耳。發生耳出血或中耳炎。衂血的血量。如果有一個立特（一個立特是一千西西）以上的時候。病人便要發生急性貧血。他的現象就是眩暈，耳鳴，惡心，嘔吐，脈搏微弱，顏面蒼白，流汗，失神等等。有時竟可因高度的衂血。陷入虛脫。或竟致失血死亡。</p>
<p>衂血的預防法。第一要緊的。就是探索他的原因。局部原因中像上期所說創傷性衂血的一，二，四，三項。是可以自已知道而避免的。譬如因鼻腔發生局部病變而來的衂血。同由鼻腔，副鼻腔，或鼻咽腔發生腫瘍而來的衂血。則和因全身原因來的衂血一樣。非由醫師診察决定治療不可。</p>
<p>衂血的急救法一、要身心安靜。不可驚惶。二、放鬆頸部。頭要抬起。便頭部的鬱血。可以减去。三、身體的位置</p>
<p>。最好是取坐位。或半臥位。四、如知道衂血是從鼻中隔前方來的時候。可在出血一邊的鼻翼。用手指向鼻中隔壓緊。或用乾凈棉花。（醫用消毒棉花最宜）塞入出血一邊的鼻孔。五、鼻背可置冰囊。或冷濕布。用了這種急救法。還不止血的時候。一定有某種特別原因存在。最安全的辦法。就是趕快囑托專科醫師詳細診察。至於衂血的藥物止血法及器械止血法。因爲不屬於衛生常識範圍。所以我也借此把衂血的常識。當作完題不講了。</p>

<h3>介紹虹橋療養院</h3>
<p>海上療養院頗多，而其較有新式設</p>
<p>備者，幾莫非西人所有。此其故固半屬經濟問題，而海上中國醫師之不能團結，政府之不能贊助，亦爲極大原因。今無鍚丁福保氏獨創虹橋療養院，其目的卽在以華人之力，建設適於華人之醫院，而由華人管理，并願以此醫院，貢諸</p>
<p>全國新醫界，故其設備，不僅嫓美歐西，而且過之，諸凡醫藥看護含飯食等，均特別加以注意，今已告成，深喜其能於海上醫界增進不少之地位，故樂爲之介紹。（編者）</p>
<h3>本院概况</h3>
<p>設計　　本院全部均由啓明建築事務所奚福泉君設計，復經多數專門醫師長時期之討論而始决定，並委安記營造廠承造，其全屋式樣爲堆疊式之階梯形，其特點爲療養室部份完全南向，在每室內均有充分之光綫及空氣，且人立在上層陽臺上，其視綫能不及下層洋臺上人之行動其同層之陽臺，每間亦互相隔離，以備橫臥憇息之用，（參閱陽光綫之剖面圖）總之，全屋之內外部份，簡潔而美觀，爲東亞最新之建築。</p>
<h3>構造</h3>
<p>院舍分大小二座，均爲立方體式，大者高四層，小者爲一層，互相隔離，全部均以鋼骨混凝土建築，不特工程堅固，且無火患之虞，全部牆壁對於避音方面，亦極注意。</p>
<p>病室凡院內之臥室，俱有電流設備，熱氣暖具，以及冷熱水管等，凡各種管子及電綫，均藏於暗牆壁之內，而所有牆角等處，俱作半圓形，俾至不堆積塵垢，又可便利消毒。安靜爲療養院中第一要素，故走郎之中，均有橡皮地板之裝置，不但美觀淸潔，且可避免步履之聲浪。</p>
<h3>手術室</h3>
<p>手術室之大部分光綫，來自北面，無東西光綫直射耀目之弊：若在夜間施行手術，則採取最新式無陰影之燈光設備，室內用淡灰色橡皮地板，施行手術時絕無行走之聲浪擾人，而又易於冲洗消毒，其旁有醫生更衣室，器具室，消毒室各一間，若在夏季施行手術，則有冷氣裝置，無炎威之苦。</p>
<h3>特產室</h3>
<p>待產室卽在手術室之旁，有各種新式設備，應用時尤爲便利。</p>
<p>全有避震設備者SchockProof凡來院者，不論何時均可使用，絕對的安全，而毫無危險之存在，短波電療機Shortwave|iahermie亦爲醫學上之最新發明而治療功用極巨者，本院均首先置備，以供各界之需要。</p>
<h3>治療</h3>
<p>治療及治備方面，均爲最新式之方法，無論化學的物理的刺激的療法，及人工氣胸術，均可施行，對於上氣管枝疾患，及各種肺病患者，如氣管枝喘息，助膜炎等，以及神經衰弱病症等，皆極易奏效，此蓋鄕間氣候，與城巿空氣，淸濁逈殊使然。瘦弱及貧血之小孩，須用刺激療法者，至院療養，尤爲相宜。又心臓機能不全者，不宜於高山療養，若長住鄕村，亦較易恢復其元氣。</p>
<p>申</p>
<p>本院特備福特八汽缸病車一輛，裝有最新工汽球車胎，故行走時穏妥異常　　交通</p>
<p>本院爲便利交通起見，特備小客車一輛，往來本院及靜安寺（待車處在靜安寺對面雪　照相館）之間，每日開行四次，上下午各二次，其時間請用電話詢問。（二一九五五）</p>
<h3>結論</h3>
<p>本院爲多數專門醫師及建築家，經長時間之規劃而定，於實用方面，衛生方面，處處顧到之外，尤合於國人之習慣，此乃吾國人自築療養院之嚆矢，實亦爲吾同志同仁共同愛護之結晶品也。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（九）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第四章　肺結核之演進</p>
<p>（四）第四種是由病人的痰唾而蔓延其他部分的。他是由肺部的上面蔓延到氣管喉管裏面去的，也可以因痰唾下咽。由咽喉而達到腸部的。另一方面，像排除尿便的泌尿器系統腎臓膀胱等，都可以被侵襲的。還有其他一部分未能向外排除的痰唾，他仍可再向其他的氣管枝發展的，這裏面頂習見的，當然是肺下葉一部分了。像這樣向各方侵襲的情形，是日進無已的。明白了這一點，那末，肺結症頑固難治的原因由，我想讀者們也應該大概了解了！</p>
<p>讀了上面所述的種種，那末，對於肺結核症的演進情形，現在可以做一個簡單的報告了！我們曉得，肺結核最初傳染的地方，是至肺尖和氣管枝腺體二處的：（據最近學理，係在銷骨下面肺部份。）假使氣管枝腺體呈乾酪變性的狀態，他從此可由淋巴管進展，結果肺部是被侵襲成功了！因爲淋巴管的終點，是和靜脈接近的，所以血管系統方面，也是有侵襲的機會的。另外的，像咳嗽痰唾二種症象，都可以使本病日事進展，并波及其他器官的。</p>
<p>關於肺結核症的最初傳染的情形，每個人和侵襲，當然是不止一次的。但經過一次傳染，是有相當的免疫性的；這種免疫性，雖不像天花痧子傷寒等病那樣决絕，差不多一生不患第二次的；但是第二次的傳染，症勢總比較緩和一點。當然呢，例外的情形，是時常看得出的；譬如在小孩時期，係患過腺和骨結核的，到了後來，很多係患帶增生性的肺結核症，并且因此而患急性粟粒結核，陷於死亡的。但這終究較係少數。</p>
<p>肺結核的演進情形，上面大概已經講過了；那末，我們還要問：在他演進和停止的時候，他種種方面的組織呈何種的變化呢？這就是尋常病理解剖的部分了。他是很複雜而不是片詞單語所可盡的，只好留待下面專章叙述了！</p>

<h3>文言|白話|大衆語</h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>現在已經有人喊出「文言復興「的口號，同時也有人倡言「反對文言復興」，好像久已停止了的文言白話的論戰又要重演一番。</p>
<p>其實文言白話的論戰早已分過勝負了，並不是林琴南章行嚴諸先生的文言文做得不好，他們趕不上古人；只因中國社會已經走到某種程度變革的路上，基礎一動，舊文化全般動搖，文學革命只有其中的一種。這種大勢所趨，自然還有許多回環曲折，可是站在沒落下去的某方面無論個人或他所屬的某一階層，雖然還能够來幾次掙扎，最後的勝利却不會歸到他們的，儘管也得佩服他們的勇敢。</p>
<p>總而言之，文言白話的論戰早已過去了，目前我們雖然聽到（文言復興）的口號，並不感得怎樣的嚴重。至於個人爲了某種必要，做幾篇文言文，只要對於社會上不生惡影響，不致毒害大衆，暫時似乎不妨容忍。　　文言白話之爭旣已表過不提，現在我以爲要提出的是比白話更進一步，提倡大衆語文學。這理由並不怎樣高深繁重，就極淺薄極簡單的說，十多年來的白話文雖然比較文言的東西是要和大衆接近些兒，可是事實上告訴我們，這個顯然還不够。目前的白話文學只是智識分子一個階層的東西，還不是普遍的大衆所需要的。再添上一句簡單的話說，只因這種白話還不是大衆的語言。</p>
<p>從前爲了要補救文言的許多缺陷，不能不提倡白話，現在爲了要糾正白話文學的許多缺點，不能不提倡大衆語。</p>
<p>這里所謂大衆語，包括大衆說得出，聽得懂，看得明白的語言文字。標準的大衆語，似乎還得靠將來大衆語文學家的作品來規定，最要緊的還得先看一看目前大衆所受的敎育程度是怎麼樣，並須想到將來大衆該受怎樣程度的敎育。</p>
<p>這里所謂大衆，固然不妨廣泛的說是國民的全體，可是主要的分子還是佔全民百分之八十以上的農民，以及手工業者，新式產業工人，小商人，店員，小販等等。就目前大衆的敎育程度而論，可惜還沒有精密的調查統計可做根據，只能大概的這麼說，有的受過號稱新式的小學敎育，有的只受過舊式的私塾敎育，有的只受過年把幾個月的補習敎育，識字敎育。此外，受過新式中等以上學校敎育的極少，不識字的倒最多。這樣說來，目前大衆說得出，聽得懂，看得明白的語言文字是怎麼樣的一種程度就不難想像到了。</p>
<p>自就，我所說的大衆語文學，一方面要適合大衆用的語言文字，一方面還得提高大衆的文化水準。倘若語言文字上有歐化的必要不妨歐化，可是不要只爲了個人擺出留學生或懂得洋文的架子。有採用文言字彙的必要不防採用，可是不要單爲了個人擺出國學家或懂得古文的架子。</p>
<p>據我個人的愚見，大衆語文學在詩歌小說戲曲三類，說聽着三樣都須顧到。尤其要注重聽。呌人聽得懂。因爲詩歌朗讀也好，唱奏也好，聽得懂就是深入大衆的一個必要的條件。爲什麼白居易的詩在當時社會特別流行？爲什麼黎錦暉先生的歌曲如今特別流行？除了其他的條件以外，聽得懂，也怕是一個重要原因。至於戲曲上演，動作姿勢雖能帮助大衆了解劇情，重要的還在說白曲詞能够呌大衆聽得懂。還有如今的小說雖然不必由說書的人說給大衆去聽，但是念起來能够和說話差不多，也是深入大衆層的一個條件罷。</p>
<p>我因爲看到了徐懋庸曹聚仁兩先生關於文言文的論文，我就跳過白話，更進一步，在文學上主張大衆語，姑且這樣粗略的提出了，聽取大家的高明的意見。</p>
<h3>夢想與理想</h3>
<p>— 淵</p>
<p>人道主義的弱點，就是開刀的給病者以過度的科羅芳，一方面固然减輕了病者的痛苦，另一方面却使人遂一瞑不視。考中國社會上的倫理，大都蹈着這種弊病的。</p>
<p>舊的，新的，中國的，西洋的，各式各樣的麻醉劑也眞多！對于人生之毒害，實不下于鴉片。舉一品中國的爲例，便是（人生若夢）！</p>
<p>從來文學者，如果不是傻子，而是有思想人眼光的智士，大抵不得志于當時，不得志則有牢騷，牢騷之後往往繼之以潦倒。陶淵明總算超然的隠士了，也不免有閑情；屈原更是不得志，而又不大肯承認（人生若夢）的，終于生活不下去了而自沈。賈誼也不肯糊塗，便終于夭了壽。直到佛敎在中國盛行之後，人生若夢的哲學也盛興起來，從此欲自殺者大多出家，算是這麼一劑麻醉品的功效。</p>
<p>如果大家以爲人生若夢了，便要啼笑俱非，不知莊周之夢爲蝴蝶歟，蝴蝶之夢爲莊周歟？結果便要心平氣和，反正是一夢媽媽虎虎過去了事。受了打擊者正可尋到慰安，打擊旁人者正好因而放肆，夢而已，計較什麼呢？</p>
<p>無知從此也抹殺了是非之情，夢中有什麼不可能呢？飢餓者夢到吃石子，石子便可吃了；復仇者夢到殺人，仇敵便因此殺了；這是多麼寫意的勾當呢？那麼，際此是非無用之會，便也不妨呌人大家將人生當作夢罷了。</p>
<p>但是，作夢是不好的。</p>
<p>歐洲社會時時生出天才，作事業也往往成功，但那是理想者，不作夢·中國社會上也時常生出天才，但多是夢想家，不合理。他們的氣度，是好像可以活一千歲，作事則爲全人類計，爲後世計，但我們的氣度是略略自了，做一塲春夢而已，看各個科學家文學家是知道的。</p>
<h3>論「讀書人」</h3>
<p>— 大琨</p>
<p>六月十二日的自由談上徐懋庸先生說：「我是看輕現在的所謂讀書人的，至少我是看輕像我這樣的讀書人的，」是怎麼樣的讀書人呢，那是「其實是一無所能而裝作讀書人似的在社會制度的破綻之處茍全着性命」的那種人。這自然是對的。但倘若我們並不把所謂讀書人看作如此狹義，如此固定，那麼今日的讀書人是否已眞正完全無用，也就很難說了。　讀書人的出路其實是不止「帮閒」與「自殺」兩條的。還有更重要的一條，那就是覺悟了自已的不對而努力去把自已底「長衫脫下來」，徐先生說「讀書人」的「長衫」與孫行者的金箍一樣是套上容易脫下難的。這果是由衷之言，但也究竟還是因爲沒有十二個的勇氣去脫的緣故。若是努力去脫，努力去幹，我相信徐先生的「長衫」也畢竟會像孫行者的金箍在如來佛的面前化爲鳥有的。</p>
<p>看哪，像日本的秋田雨崔那樣，不是終於脫下了他底「長衫」了嗎？如果說讀書人應該看輕，那也只是如徐先生所說的那種讀書人。那些努力着脫去「長衫」的讀書人（或智識份子）誰說是沒用的呢？</p>
<h3>仙人堂</h3>
<p>— 蒨英</p>
<p>五月三十日上午伴小莎到梅隴找活仙人。本來小莎亦是一個摩登姑娘，因爲被許多舊的宣傳錯亂了神經，聽說梅隴的活仙人能够把小莎的母親從陰世帶往陽間，能够抱着小莎母女間訴說一段的小莎，現在爲了自已的母親，乃顯出了她自已的矛盾。</p>
<p>那日同小莎搭上滬杭車，雖則小莎是那麼可愛的，可是我那時有些討厭她起來。一個裝滿了一肚子新思想的女孩子，一時理智會被情感衝動得如此，眞是出人意珍的了。在車箱中，我同她申辯了許多時候，竟弄得車到梅隴不下來而到了，莘莊再用兩只脚開倒車。</p>
<p>從莘莊回到梅隴，有六里路，五月太陽是老實不客氣的，一對年輕人的心晒得要溶在一塊了。小莎爲了要會她死了的母親。我呢？我是爲了小莎，願意把臉袋同太陽拚命的。假使仙人有靈，我何嘗亦不願意會會小莎的母親呢。沿鐵路走，同路的只有上龍華回來的鄕下人，鄕下的路走起來一拐一拐的，眞限人，走上半里要問一問路：</p>
<p>「老婆婆，仙人堂走去還有多少呢？</p>
<p>「少爺。你們去招亡人麼，還有三里路哩！」</p>
<p>「大老官！仙人堂走去還有多少路？」</p>
<p>「嘻，你們上海來的洋先生亦相信仙人的麼！仙人堂就在那邊，過石橋，就是那個白房子的」我有意地對小莎看看。　走到了那個白房子門前，門牌上有紫藤棚XX號而沒有仙人堂的字樣。一片小塲上攤滿了剛收下的豐滿的麥子，邊門裏一個老年婦人，和一個中年女人立在外面觀望。</p>
<p>「這裏是仙人堂麼？」小莎急於問那一個中年的女人。那個中年女人向老婦人看看，回答道：「你們找什麼」？</p>
<p>「你們不是會把死了的人呌到陽間來的麼，我們要呌亡人到陽間來問話。」小莎還是孩子那般質直的表明了來意。老年婦人問知了我們老遠從蘇州來，又問了是不是很虔誠的崇拜此間大仙人等話，於是允許我們到了裏面去。</p>
<p>「活仙人在那裏呢？」小莎吃了一杯水問中年婦人，中年婦人笑笑，指着在拿香燭的那個老年婦人說：「就是我的娘！」　我老是吃茶不開口，小莎是很虔誠的，同那中年女人談話。</p>
<p>「我們已經許多時候不招亡人了，現在我們只能替人醫病。」</p>
<p>現在的人往往不信我們仙人的，所以我們不能靠招亡人過活，這次你們旣然很遠的來，情面不可推却，替你們招一下吧。」</p>
<p>跟着老婦人走進左廂房，開進一間陰暗的房子，我們打了</p>
<p>一個寒噤，那是陳設着鬼用的錢財，燭，香一張方桌和二張長凳像走進了一個鬼世界。　老婦人坐下，小莎和我亦坐下，燒上了幾十只紙錠，室內的空氣是邪靜的，這裏有鬼的神秘，一切會把年靑人的心弄昏迷的。</p>
<p>老婦人要小莎交代死人姓名，和縣分圖分等，老婦人閉上了眼睛，口裏唸唸有詞鬼說亡人要車馬，要陽間人化錢糧，小莎立卽化紙錠，跪拜眞像在迎接她的母親。那時我老不開口，用旁觀者淸醒的腦子來靜觀。</p>
<p>老婦人，一刻肚痛，頭痛，咳，呵欠，白眼用手向前抓動，裝鬼臉，呻吟，把小莎嚇得臉白。</p>
<p>老婦人呌姆媽來啦！於是小莎再跪，起立，老婦攙小莎手講話了。</p>
<p>「阿囡！我娘在陰間牽記你，你們在陽間牽記我麼」？小莎回答「牽記你」，動情地眼淚流下來了，老婦人卽來拉我的手，把我當做了小莎的親爹爹，對我說了一大套要把家立業，要同女兒找一個如意的夫婿，做妻的纔不枉有你這一個好丈夫。老婦人說到這裏，小莎已收住了眼淚，向我瞟了一眼，再聽她說下去！</p>
<p>「你同爹爹要好好的，做娘的在陰間保祐你們强强健健，陞官發財，爹爹要討繼母，你們將來會吃苦的，你要不准他討！」回頭來對我說：「你答應我麼，不討女人，答應我麼？「老婦人向我板起了面孔，小莎眼淚沒有了，笑了，我亦笑了，老婦人紅起臉來了。　一刻又肚痛，頭痛，咳嗽，呵欠，白眼，···低聲的「我去啦」老婦人又恢復了原來的神情。呵！呵，嘆了兩口鬼氣。</p>
<p>小莎亦回復了原有淸楚的理智，摸去了十毛小洋，急於要走了。</p>
<p>沿着回去的鐵道，我挽着小莎說：「你相信麼？鬼，仙人，否則要呌我一聲爹爹呢？」「眞到霉，還向她跪拜了三次，」像演了一幕鬼戲。小莎　有些懊悔了。</p>
<p>那白屋子漸漸地離開了我們，仙人堂！仙人堂！</p>
<h3>鄕道中</h3>
<p>— 王一心</p>
<p>雖然道路是這麼崎嶇，但也是溫熱的道路呵：當我踏上一支狗尾草，一塊碎石子，一朶野花，　　X　　X　　　X</p>
<p>窄峽的鄕道多柔軟呢，故鄕的夕陽多溫愛呢，我見着童年的自子了，天眞的山水是足實的，雖然道路是這麼崎嶇。</p>
<h3>桂英爸（三）</h3>
<p>— 嘩子</p>
<p>就是我所謂「發現」的那一天，四點多鐘的時候，我正睡在牀上，忽然被一種大聲所驚醒。仔細一聽，這聲音是屬於桂英爸的，似乎是在演說。我慌忙起來，妻她們已經到樓下去了。我也走到樓下的店堂內。妻對我說：「在爆發了。」於是我留心看。店門前也圍着一大羣看的人，多半是隣家的女人和小孩子。對面雜貨店的老闆，也放下小說在望着。</p>
<p>桂英爸赤着上身站在櫃臺前面。在櫃臺上擺着一大碗酒，還有四五粒花生米，都是屬於他的，但他沒有功夫吃。</p>
<p>「···殺！殺！該殺！這老婆子！」他揚着手說。</p>
<p>他把濯濯的禿頭微俯向前，左右搖盪，兩條濃眉，向上弓起，兩隻大眼向上睜起，兩撇鬍子向上翹起|總而言之，他面上的一切，連筋肉都竭力向上掙扎，但是那個禿頂和多鄒紋的額却竭力壓迫它們，這使得桂英爸的表情，似乎大怒而其實是在忍耐。</p>
<p>「不殺掉有什麼用，這瘋攤的東西！一點也不會動，燒飯，洗衣，都是我的事，還要賣山粉腐。她倒享福，坐着吃，還要挑剔我。今天到了三點多鐘，就把山粉腐賣完了，我很高興。這老東西却駡了起來，她說今天生意這樣好，早上爲什麼不多做些，不然還可以多賺幾個錢，她駡我偷懶。其實，早上做多少，完全是她自已出的主意，她說昨天賣不完，生意不好，今天不如少做些，我就少做了，我聽了她的話，她反來埋怨我，這個沒良心的老東西！我要把她殺死，養着她有什麽用？我一個人自賺自吃，要到那裏就去那裏，多快活！我還有本領，還有氣力，你們看我吃酒。」</p>
<p>他的眼光向觀衆掃了一周，最後注意在酒碗上面，於是用兩手把碗捧起，頭俯得更低，以口就碗，閉了眼，喝酒。跟着酒的减少，他的頭和碗漸漸地上昇，最後，他的面部和碗底都朝天了，這樣地把一大碗酒一口氣喝光，他纔開了眼，喘一口氣，右手拿了空碗回觀衆一　「完了，哈哈哈！」笑了出來，一面用左手的手背揩鬍子。</p>
<p>鬍子上沾着幾點亮晶晶的酒珠，有一大點，則從下巴流經過頭頸，胸脯，一直流到肚臍孔。他的褲子繫得很低，肥胖的肚子。是露出着的。</p>
<p>「阿仁，再來一碗，···哈哈！老子從前當兵的時候，眞會喝酒，一口氣十大碗），滿不在乎，夥伴們都稱讚，癩頭三能呀！不欺人的，會喝酒的纔有本領。那年在杭州打戲院，一路拳|脚，誰見了都怕。現在癩頭三老了，酒也只能喝兩大碗了，但是也還有兩大碗酒的本事，你們看···着！」</p>
<p>他大喝一聲，盡力在櫃壹上打了一拳。看的人都吃了一嚇，接着却笑了起來。</p>
<p>「誰經得起這一拳？我那老婆，要是吃了這一拳，還不陷到地下去麼？但是我不打，不打。我要用刀殺她，用刀，嚓！······」</p>
<p>「老不死，好回家去了，醺飽了酒，又發起瘋來，成什麼樣子！」</p>
<p>這是桂英媽一拐一瘸地經過酒店門口，隔着人叢説了幾句。她的孤獨的眼和孤獨的門牙，顯得比平日更可怕，她手中提着洋的，所以説了幾句就走過去了。</p>

<h3>從德國負債觀察馬克之動向</h3>
<p>— 譚秉文</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>自英美相繼停止金本位以後，世界通貨制度已入於混亂狀態。蓋此二國爲國際上最大投資國債權國，握有整個世界經濟之實權：其本位幣制之變動，尤足予他國以决定的影響也。縱觀所謂金本位集團諸國，莫不惴惴自危，時有放棄金本位之可能。法蘭西以其特殊金融機構||承受市塲之特別發達，故金本位雖屢次謠傳放棄，而今猶倖免。意大利瑞士最近亦有减低平價之意。德國中央銀行（Reichsbank）素以强有力見稱於世，迺得運用之以作嚴密的匯兌管理，勉力維持金本位。茲專就後者而言：德爲世界最大債務國，負有償還他國以鉅額現金之義務。世界經濟恐慌日臻深刻化，債權國請求提回借欵者日衆，逐釀成資金向外奔流之勢。結果中央銀行存金大减，無法應付對外（穏定外匯）對內（再貼現及公開市塲）諸問題。夫中央銀行爲一國金融樞鈕，茍其本身陷於週轉不靈之境，則整個國民經濟，將受其累。今夫减低平價，實施跌幣傾銷（ExchangeDumpl）ng），幾爲各大資本主義國大勢所趨，是則近日馬克貶價之說，固匪捕風捉影荒誕無稽之譚，實有所根據也。請述其理若次。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>德國爲世界最大債務國，而影響其國民經濟最鉅且大者，卽爲債務支付問題。馬克之前途，亦卽緊乎此。是故就債務關係上觀察馬克，以把握其動向，或不致徒勞也。據最近柏林景氣研究所（Ronjunkrlndriut）之調查，德國現下對外債務狀態，有如第一表。</p>
<p>表一　德國對外債務（單位十億馬克）</p>
<p>債權國　一九三O年六月一九三三年六月一九三四年三月美國　　　　七·四三三·五七||英國　　　　一·六四一·三O||法國　　　　O·九七O·三五||荷蘭　　　　二·三OO·八七||瑞士　　　　二·O一O·八O||比利時　　　O·二OO·O九||意大利　　　O·二二O·一七||瑞典　　　　O·三三O·一二||其他諸國　　O·三六O·三O||以上長期債務合計一五·五六　七·五七　六·五O美國　　　　三·九九三·二二||英國　　　　一·四七一·O八||法國　　　　O·四六O·二六||荷蘭　　　　一·六三O·七五||瑞士　　　　一·六四O·五四||比利時　　　O·一八O·O六||意大利　　　O·O五O·一五||瑞典　　　　O·一九O·O九||捷克　　　　O·一六O·一二||丹麥　　　　O·O七O·O四||其他諸國　　O·五八O·二六||國際淸算銀行O·六四O·三二||以上短期債務合計一一·一六　六·六九　五·OO</p>
<p>德國對外政治債務及商業債務（以購買有價證劵，土地及經營企業之形式而投下之外國資本除外）之消長，吾人可按圖索驥，窺其一斑。一九三O年中葉，爲二百六十乃至七十億馬克，達最高峯。以後因一九三一年七月之金融恐慌暴發，債權諸國提回資金，以膨脹其國內信用，德國對外債務大减，至一九三三年六月，長債减至七十六億馬克，短債减至六十七億馬克，合計僅及一百四十億馬克。迄乎本年三月底，更减至十一億馬克。德國自歐戰慘敗後，卽以借債度活，借新債還舊債（財政學上所謂之借換Converlion），尤爲德國復興工商業之唯一手段。債務减少，卽表示外國投資家裏足不前，而德國國內乃呈信用緊縮，通貨缺乏，物價下落之家。</p>
<p>夷考外資减少之原因，不外下列數端：（一）外國債權者之提回，（二）英磅與美圓之下落，以及由此而發生之，（三）對外貿易之不振。第一項不在本文討論範圍之內。姑置勿論，而專就（二）（三）項加以檢討。誠然，在長期間中，英磅美圓之减低平價，足使德國債務負擔减輕。然此僅爲長期間之事而已，在短期間中，因英磅美圓貶價而使德國輸出貿易陷於不利，其所受損害，實足抵銷减輕債務負擔之利益而有餘。蓋外匯逆轉，則維持舊有平價之德意志必感輸出之不利。德國爲一債務國，同時爲一工業國。彼需要鉅額外資，以運轉國內產業之機輪。國內產業獲得外資於以發展，而產生利潤，此利潤中之一部分卽以爲支付債務之用。夫產業之發展　以輸出順利爲前提。如上述，英美諸國本位幣貶價。德國滙市下落，輸出貿易不振，國內產業大受影響。難辯莫如事實，請證以數字。</p>
<p>表二　德國對上外貿易（單位百萬馬克）年度　　輸入　　輸出　　出超（十）或入超（一）一九三O年　一O、三九三　一二、O三六　（十）一、六四三一九三一年　六、七二七　　九、五九九　　（十）二、八七二一九三二年　四、六六七　　五、七三九　　（十）一、O七二一九三三年　四、二O四　　四、八七一　　（十）　六六七一九三四年第一季　一、一四八　一、O九四（十）　五四（註）資料來源：一九三O年至一九三三年</p>
<p>數字根據日本Diamond經濟雜誌二十二卷七號四八頁，一九三四年數字根據五月十二號倫敦經濟週刋所載。</p>
<p>準此，德國輸出貿易以一九三O年爲最旺盛，達一百二十億馬克，然同年輸入亦達一百億馬克餘，故出超僅爲一百餘億馬克、翌年輸入出俱减，係經濟恐慌之結果，所幸輸入之减超於輸出之减，故出超爲二百億馬克，破從來之記錄。以後輸出入貿易俱减，出超額减縮之勢尤烈。迨乎本年第一季，竟有五千四百萬馬克之入超。在此種情形下，貨物不能輸出，國內滯貨日增，而物價暴跌，助長國內以濟恐慌。據五月十二日倫敦經濟週刋所載，德國躉售物價指數，去年三月爲一二六·四，今年同期降至一O一·九。生活費指數，在同期間亦自一八七·七降至一一六·六。景氣之雲，已從德意志消逝矣！</p>
<p>德國國際貿易不振，國際收入一項大减，旣如上述：然德國對外債務所應償還之金額，則未嘗或减也。不但無减而已，抑且有增。據德國外債調查所（AnmeldestellefurAuslandsschulden）之報告，一九三三|三四年度及一九三四|三五年度德國應償還之母金利息有如第三表。</p>
<p>表三　德國對外債務償還額（單位百萬　　　　克）</p>
<p>利息　母金償還（Amortization）總額長債　　　六一三　　　　　一五四　　　　　七六七短債　　　四三五　　　　　一二六　　　　　五六一合計　　一、O四八　　　　二八O　　　　一、三二八　　以上一九三三|三四年度實支數</p>
<p>長債　　三五O　　　一六O　　　　五一O短債　　一OO　　　四O　　　　　一四O其他　　三八O　　　一八O　　　　五六O合計　　八三O　　　三八O　　　一、二一O　　以上一九三四|三五年度估計數</p>
<p>由是觀之，德國去年一年間對外債務支付額，爲十三億金馬克，換言之，去年德國復輸出十三億馬克於海外，以淸償國際借貸關係。昔者德國國際借貸關係本賴貿易出超以資彌補。今者貿易出超，去年僅及六億餘馬克，其額不抵國外使館及其他國際支出之用，在斯情况下，德國輸出大批現金，由是中央銀行存金日减。德國一九三四|三五年度戰債，因有一九三三年二月之恊定，得債權國同意减少一部分，故債務支付總額，約爲十二億馬克。然卽此數目，在處境困難之德國國民經濟方面觀之，則甚苛重也。職是之故，本月九日起，德國中央銀行毅然將德國應付各國商人之欵項，一律停止十五天。此種措置，足證中央銀行存幣狀况之緊急：其性質嚴重，自不待言（參閱九日申報哈瓦斯電）。按德國中央銀行準備金，自人本年度以來，卽大有减少之趨勢，	較近兩月來其勢尤顯。試觀最近（五月十二號）倫敦經濟週刋所揭載德國中央銀行報告之數項目，卽可瞭然矣。</p>
<p>表四　德國中央銀行發行準備狀態（單位千馬克）</p>
<p>一九三三年　　　一九三四年　　　同年五　　　　　五月六日　　　　四月三十日　　　月七日金貨　　　四OO、七九九　二一九、二九二　一八三、五八三外國匯兌　九九、三九五　　五、八四八　　七、四O九準備率　　　　　九·一0/0　六·八0/0　五·四0/0　　德國發行制度·係採所謂伸縮發行制。詳言之，其法定現金準備率爲百分之四十，然其中五分之一得爲短期國業票據及外國匯票。在巿塲需疑孔亟時，中央銀行一時不能覓得充分現金，亦得溢額發行，惟政府須徵科其發行稅耳。觀上表，去年五月六日，尙爲九·一0/0，今年同月七日竟降至五·四0/0，較上星期减一·四0/0。更據最報載，本年本月六日，金貨减至一億一千一百萬，準備率减至三·四0/0（十日申報）。十二日時報哈瓦斯電更有一段云：「···德國中央銀行，從目前起至七月一日止，紙幣準備金，將减至九千萬馬克左右。······則準備金將减至百分之二···」此種現象，雖在大戰時尙未之見，其嚴重性不言而喩。　　（三）</p>
<p>德國金融界處境雖若是困難，吾人卽據之謂其將實行减低平價，尙有武斷之嫌。據十三日新聞報柏林電，德國官塲並有否認放棄金本位之說。然吾人所不得不懐疑者，當英美放棄金本位减低平價之前文，其國執政者，亦曾作同樣之聲明。以此例彼，吾人如是觀之，則思過半矣。抑又有進者，德現任財政部大臣克魯斯克（CountSchwerinVonKroigk）最近曾發表談話云：「馬克貶價與否，僅係一通商政策問題而已。茍馬克之貶價，足使德國輸出順利，則吾輩必樂用之。雖然，貶價以後，能否達此目的，尙屬疑問，是則吾輩現尙不欲多事冒險也。」（見Page1025VolCXVIII·NO4733倫敦經濟週刋。）由是觀之，則希特勒政府，雖不承認行將低馬克價値，然其已注意此問題，至爲明顯。</p>
<p>减低貨幣成色，與通貨脹膨脹雙管齊下，結果無形中使債務者負担减輕，凡稍洽經濟學者，莫不瞭然。舉例言之，如十二日申報路透電云··「···德政府擬於下月依目下紙幣之價率，抑低德國幣値，而等於抑低百分之四十云。」如是德國以前負担一百馬克，現只負担（實際上負担）四十馬克之債務耳。德國經濟，抵於今日，已趨山窮水盡之境，前有停付戰債二年之議（見申報五月十二日路透社電），後經美國瑞典反對，迄未實行。借新債換舊債，無異飲鳩止渴，爲禍更烈。此二法旣行不得，則减低馬克成色之嘗試，將有見諸實行之一日也乎？　　　　　六月十三日完稿於商學院</p>
<h3>世界麥業產銷之概况</h3>
<p>— 楊先序</p>
<p>自世界遭受經濟恐慌以來，無論任何產品（工業的，農業），均感覺生產與消費兩方不能平衡，近年以來，各產麥者所遭遇嚴重之問題，亦卽此供需如何得以維持，故去年八月二十五日在倫敦曾有國際麥恊定（lntesnationalWheatAgreement）成立，規定主要麥出口國家應限制其國計之販賣，同時更當减少種麥之面積，但各主要進口國家對麥之進口極其放任，於是生產者仍盡力種植，而不問消費究竟如何。</p>
<p>在倫敦麥會議（LondonWheatConfernce）時所估計爲進口國家於一九三四年七月三十一日一年度前所需要者約爲五萬六千萬斛，（Bnhel）各國出口額之分派如下，加拿大二萬萬斛，美國四千七百萬，阿根庭一萬一千萬，澳大利亞一萬零五百萬，多腦河沿岸各國五千四百萬，蘇聯及其他國家四千四百萬。</p>
<p>關於近年來國際麥巿塲之狀况如何，吾人可將美國加利福利亞州斯丹福大學食料研究所發表之結論節錄於此後。</p>
<p>一九三二至三三年間世界麥之供給又覺過豐，雖然，多腦河畔各國及美國之收成已减少，本屬進口之各歐洲國家收成特豐，乃對進口限制更加爲嚴，因此去年度出口量爲自一九一七至一八年後之最小者，目較戰前之平均數尤低，美國對歐洲以外之銷塲亦不佳，雖有中國之美麥大宗借欵，亦無濟也，在意大利德國及日本凈進口量亦見縮少，美國仍止得積存此項大宗之麥，就出口量而言，去年度美麥及麵粉爲一八六八至六九年後之最少者。</p>
<p>以金計算之，麥價之變動已在另一新的低平均水平綫，且近兩年以來，世界以麥作食料之消費亦大減，就中如美國德國日本及意大利爲最，因之存貨愈積愈多，至去年底已達一更新之高度。</p>
<p>下列之表係國農業會（lntesnationallnstnteofAgticulture）所編製，對近來世界麥生產供給及存量，作整個之統計，並有一九三國年七月三十一日以前一年度供給及需要之估計，（百萬斛）（每年爲當年七月三十一日以前之一年度）</p>
<p>世界之產量　　　世界供出口之量　　　世界需要量　　每一年度末存量是可出口者</p>

<p>產量中蘇聯中國波斯土耳其在外，一九三四年係估計數，</p>
<p>設上列一九三四年供需之估計能正確，則一九三三至三四年世界出產者不足之數當有一萬一千二百萬斛，此等不足之數量，當可以存麥塡補之，就統計數字而觀，麥之狀况實覺進步，然吾人一查一九三二年十二月至一九三三年十二月一年來麥之價格，則跌落甚劇，（單位先令，每百磅合）</p>

<p>關於各國之生產及種麥畝數（英國畝），依國際農業會所編製者，則世界之生產（除蘇聯）及少數國家）一年前似較少，一九三二至一九三三年間生產之分配，亦有巨大變遷，歐洲之收成，創前所未有之豐，一方因種麥畝數增加，他方每畝所出產者亦加多，歐洲生產之增加，無疑的因生產效力增大，并非完全由於氣候之適合，他方向在北美近數年收成反較减，一方亦由種麥面積之縮小，他方每畝所能生產者亦减低，關於蘇聯之數字，雖其畝數漸减，然其產量反突增甚多，不過蘇聯所產之麥，質量較差，在南半球，阿根庭之收成，較一年前爲鹽，但澳大利亞出產者則較一九三二至三三年度爲少，茲列表於后，（凡一九三三至三四年，其產量在一千五百萬斛以下之國家，不列。）國別　　　　種麥面積　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　生產量</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>投資西北</h3>
<p>— 岑樓</p>
<p>最近開發西北之聲，（甚囂塵上），自宋子文氏西北歸來之後，開發西北，益形熱鬧，宋氏且勸滬銀行界積極投資西北，爲中國另闢一生路。滬銀行界已接受宋氏意見，現正竭力籌備投資西北，開發西北，加入此種事業者，現已有中國交通等六銀行云。這可謂我國開發西北的一個好消息。</p>
<p>然而我們却不能不有一個疑問。開發西北，誠然，原則上是不容疑義的，然而，在中國現狀之下，｀開發西馮北，能不能暢行無阻呢？又，開發西北，應該以怎樣的方式去進行，這也得豫先的個充分的研究。</p>
<p>所謂西北，當然指廿陜及其迤西迤北一帶，這些地言，至今還是十分荒凉落後的地方。開發西北，當然，第一是要大規模的開發鑛藏，培植森林，而要大規模的開墾荒地，就非先將水利弄好不可，就是先要治黃，治渭，引洛，並多開新渠道。這都是非大規模的近代工業並大資本不行的。開發鑛藏培植森林，所費資本，當然更大，其事業也不是一刻可以促成。然而現在滬銀行界的投資西北，却祇是小規模的農村放欵，而且因爲西北農村信用，尙未確實可靠，所放之欵，更是極小數的。這當然祇能説得一種農村救濟，而决不是什麼投資，更談不止開發。</p>
<p>滬銀行界的所謂投資西北，所以只限於小數農村放欵，是有其不得得已的苦哀的，就是因爲他們明知在中國現狀之下，投資西北。開發西北，事實上多少不可能，然而開發西北之聲，日前旣已鬧得這麼響了，他們當然也不能不來應景一下，所以就有了投資西北的設計。這就是他們所以有發起投資西北的由來。然而這還是設計，實現與否，那當然還是問題。</p>
<p>中國農村的如此凋敝，不要說西北，就是平原內地，原有農村經濟組織，也早崩毀個無餘了。這是中國的一個根本問題，而决不是單單什麽空洞的開發與投資所能見效的。內地現銀所以集中於都巿，都巿銀行所以將許多現鑫集積起來，寗願去換公債證劵，做地皮生意，不願積極投資於實業，這是有他不得已的苦衷的。然而一般人總還責備都巿中的銀行不識大體，不知投資正當實業，或救濟農村，試問在這現狀下，要投資又何從投資起？救濟農村，更是難以着手了。</p>
<h3>趙家莊野景</h3>
<p>— 伶仃</p>
<p>天氣老是這麽悶熱，在一層一層輕紗似的靑雲裏，太陽已經烘出熱辣的面孔。地上是一片綠色的田野，風，拂着禾稻，吹折了枊枝，掀起了池塘裏漪漣的波紋，彷彿，一面鏡子似的，映着岸上的景物。</p>
<p>賓珠蹒跚地從牠的家裏走來，一雙深紅的滑膩的滿結實的手臂，提着一隻米藍，跳躍躍的好像一隻小鳥似的跑到河邊去了。</p>
<p>那　人的春風，溫柔地輕微地掃過她的臉上，吹亂了牠的黑漆的髪絲的捲　　她的衣角，啊！一件桃紅色的小衫子，緊緊地裏着她的身子。</p>
<p>寶珠覺得無限輕鬆似的，放下了米藍，打個呵吹，伸了下懶腰，咪着她那雙多情的眼珠子，凝神地瞧着河裏一雙雙的游魚，在河裏調戲，談情。她看得出神，突然不曉得想到了什麼，於是便忍不住的笑了。又似乎憤氣似的，蹲下身子檢了一塊瓦片，向水裏用勁一擲，叮噹一聲兒水花濺了尺多高，水面立刻起了許多的波紋，魚羣是散亂了，各處亂竄。她的面上於是現出一種滿足的微笑，因爲她勝利了。</p>
<p>可是當賓珠的心事稍稍平息了底時候，一雙小麻雀，在她的臉前搶過去，吱吱喳喳地呌着，追逐，打滾，跳落岸邊，一下子又高高的飛上來，在空間閃來閃去。寶珠起初好奇地瞧着，看看這對小情人到底是怎樣？她的心頓然又起了一種微感，望了自子的身子一下，愁着眉頭，對於這天然的樂趣，她深深的太息起來。</p>
<p>完全是個鄕村的少女的心啊，她有一顆春靑的心，和一肚濃厚的熱情。她</p>
<p>的身體是健康的肌肉的美感，曲線的顯露，畢竟和都巿的那種孱弱的頽廢的女子不同。</p>
<p>她站着，呆呆的站着不動，她似乎在深思什麽，剛纔被她驅散的魚羣，一雙雙又聚集起來。此刻，她再没有心事去拆散她們的情侣了。她起了無數的傾幕之心，她彷彿覺得自已太孤寂，太可憐，太不幸了。</p>
<p>没精打彩地她便懶答答坐下來，把米藍放到水裏去，用勁的洗。浪花四處蕩漾，她的心也蕩漾着啦！</p>
<p>忽然，在她的背後走來了一個子：</p>
<p>『寶三妹！』</p>
<p>『誰呀？）驚詫地回頭瞧了下』是|你！鬼暈的，把我嚇死了。』</p>
<p>『怎的？幾天没有見面了。』</p>
<p>『干你不什事！』</p>
<p>『我多想你啊！』</p>
<p>『死鬼！你會想我嗎？』</p>
<p>「想得兇，我早就想到你那兒去，</p>
<p>但我怕那個老鬼」，那個男子緊緊的握着她的手「寶三妹！你可想我嗎？」</p>
<p>「想你幹嗎！」寶珠似乎害羞，摸摸自已　的臉兒。</p>
<p>「我的寶啊！」那男的摟着她。</p>
<p>寶珠的臉紅潤了，她也握着男的手，她沉醉了，從他的手中，透過了一股熱氣，一種奇特的力量，那是血的奔流，情的交錯，愛的流，熱的流，她坐不穏了，於是撲倒在他的懐裏。</p>
<p>小鳥在樹頭上吱吱喳喳地呌，是一種溫柔的沉醉的歌聲。</p>
<h3>我茫然地握住她的手</h3>
<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>當我的一隻手握住她的一隻手的時候，我的心是跳得如何厲害呵！</p>
<p>我得感謝上帝，他賜予我這樣一個好機會！這時房裏非常寂靜，除了她和我，只有默默地躺着一張鐵床，一個方桌和四隻圓椅套，沒有一位第三者在，連娘姨也到隔舍洗衣服去了。其實我今天何嘗願得去看電影？我只要有她和我在一塊兒談話，便得到了無限慰藉，什麼事都可以不做了|卽做了也不能引起我的興味。所以今天雖然電影看不成，我反而覺得不勝其欣悅。</p>
<p>她今天顯得格外美麗。她是一個天眞而可愛的女子，有着一雙黑大的眼和一張菱角形的嘴，講起話來總是那麼跳跳躍躍。她平日很喜歡和我閒談，在飯後或睡前。她今天又和我說了許多零雜有趣的話。</p>
<p>我們相聚已幾個月了，彼此間不知不覺已有一種超乎尋常的情感存在着。尤其是我，呀！不知怎的，自知她第一次晤面之後，她的影象，更深深地印留在我的心坎上。從那時起，我們同住一屋，朝夕相見，過着很快樂的日子。以後，接觸旣久，情感愈厚。幾乎片刻不見她，我的心便不會安靜。但是呵，我本是個多愁善感的男子，故這時愛的火雖然在我的心上燃燒着，我總是用力去撲滅牠，不使牠炎烈起來。因爲我担憂着我們之間，倘偶一不愼，走上了愛的路，那是萬分危險的，必至陷於無法自拨的絕境。然而無法的愛火，豈容你去鎭壓嗎？你越想撲滅牠，牠就越燃燒得猛强。我至此已受到了有生以來未曾受到的困悶和痛苦！</p>
<p>今天，她和我，站立在常時站立的地方，手靠在窗上，並肩細談着。我們一談，不覺又談得很久的辰光了。遙望天畔一輪紅日，已披上輕薄的晚雲，漸漸地向西隠沉下去。窗外一陣陣的凉風，吹動我們的頭髪，鬆散地在飛舞。我們心神感到了舒暢，使繼續再談下去，幾不知夜之將至。</p>
<p>四五個月來。我們生活在一起，彼此無猜，像這樣親熱地說話，今天並不是第一次。然而今天，我的心，却有些異樣了。爲什麼會異樣，我也不明白。只覺得忐忑不自在，呼吸很急促，又像快要窒息似的。我有些站不隠了，隨卽向脚後的椅坐下，將頭伏在窗上。這時我心中所感到的說不出的苦悶，迫得我禁不住就要放聲哭出來。然而我不敢，我意識到我是不能無緣由地在她的面前哭的，故我仍極力把牠壓平下去。當她看到我這樣難過，站近到我的身旁，她的一隻手無意地觸着我的一隻手的刹那間，一股熱的電，突然從她的手透流過來。於是我抵不起這樣强烈的刺戟，終於忘記了一切，茫然地移動我的手去握住她的手，緊緊地。突突地跳，跳，跳，我的心。她也似驚非驚的呆立着，睜開了兩個黑大的眼迫視着我。</p>
<p>夜色籠罩了大地，房裏愈呈着寂靜。兩隻手依舊緊握着，默然，直到黑暗把我們吞沒了去。</p>
<h3>悵惘</h3>
<p>— 沅芷</p>
<p>學校裏的佈告板上，已有畢業考試的日程揭示在那裏了。</p>
<p>看到這，心頭便有一股難言的情緒襲擊着。驀然從夢中驚醒來似的，我才感到自已行將畢業了。</p>
<p>時間眞快啦，在每一個空隙裏，牠疾馳着逝去，無聲無臭地。怎麼自已進這學校已有了四年了呢？在我，那還好似日昨的事一般，而畢業這兩個龐大的，然而游移的字，便映在面前了！</p>
<p>「畢業」，在一般人看來，也許視爲光榮的可喜的事。在自身說，以爲能辛苦地，把幾年的學生程讀完，便可用之於社會，做一個自立的人了。在社會方面說，則國家化費了不少財力，培養起一批人才來，很不容易，此後能爲社會服務，造福社會，是件多麼可喜的事啊！</p>
<p>然而，在我，只感到了幻滅。</p>
<p>在以前，當我沒有進這學校的時候，心中未始不是萬分羨慕，渴望着自已也會來享受享愛這幸福。後來，終於和家庭奮鬥成功了，自已也據然可以大步地跨進這學府之門，心頭的欣慰與驕矜，眞是難於言說的。可是，不久，當你習慣於這其間的生活，實地嘗到了內含的滋味的時候，便又覺得平淡乏味了，甚至有時還會使你感到另一種不滿的缺憾。</p>
<p>便在這麼一種平凡的生活中，我和其他的同學們一樣，挨過了四個年頭。在這四年中，眞是糊裏湖塗，固然不能說十分優裕快樂，却也找不出苦痛的理由和痕跡來。</p>
<p>現在，已是四年長時間的尾閭了。以後的生活，都得靠此刻來定奪，是幸福，是苦痛，只消一箭的差池。現在正是總結過去和期謀將來的緊急關頭呵。</p>
<p>正因爲如此，所以我感到幻滅，悵惘，痛苦，幾個嚴重的問題，使我寒心，使我恐懼。</p>
<p>要是徼倖能畢業了，則此後向那裏去呢？這是最近的將來的問題，也是最最嚴重的問題。自然，畢業後是找職業。然而在這人浮於事，粥少僧多的不安定的社會中，你要想找到一件相當的職業，眞非易易。自已旣沒舅父或姨夫在做洋行和工廠的經理買辦，又沒有姊姊做要人們的姨太太，任你有着滿腹經綸，和鍬硬的拳頭，又有何用？</p>
<p>由於以上兩個問題，更使我憂慮到不要眞的失業了，那末非但辜負了父母的苦心，而旦還要遭社會上許多人的奚落。</p>
<p>啊！聽我從何訴說呢？這內心的矛盾和痛苦。我該怨自已的不努力呢，還是該呢咒詛社會制度的不良！</p>
<h3>柴船</h3>
<p>— 君奇</p>
<p>末是那麼陰沉沉地灰敗得像死人的臉！</p>
<p>我帶着昏昏的腦袋，從XX鎭看了廟會回來，走到鐵路橋邊，我忽然本能地停止了步子，一件奇突的事故，把我有視綫抓止：</p>
<p>一個穿着黄色制服的保衛團丁站在河的近邊，肩上歪斜的擔着半新舊的毛瑟槍，眼睛瞪着平静的河面，一個希望的微笑掛在他的嘴角。</p>
<p>「骨都，骨都，」一隻裝滿稻柴的船，從橋的那一邊搖來，一個農人模樣的年輕人，努力地搖着櫓，他那副菜色的憂鬱的臉蛋，明顯的表示出正在愁着飯米！</p>
<p>船過橋了，行近保衛團了立着的岸邊。</p>
<p>「喂·拋兩個稻柴來！」團丁涏着臉皮悄聲向船上人說。</p>
<p>「···」年輕的搖船人很機巧地知道他的用意，一種憤恨的念頭，使他仍舊自管自的向前搖去。</p>
<p>「給錢好了，買你的！」圑丁邊跟邊說。</p>
<p>「······」年輕的搖船人不去理會。</p>
<p>「搖攏來！···聽見不？」團丁的軟話失敗後，就換了强硬的口氣來威嚇，</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>但船還是繼續的搖着，這樣，團丁眞的惱怒了！媽的，做慣買賣的人，從來不曾吃過虧的，今天倒碰着釘子了！他檢起石子，乒乓乒乓地向船上打去，可是搖船的速度加快啦！顯然丟石子是沒有用的。於是保衛團丁拿起槍來，裝上子彈向船邊河水中射去：轟的一聲，嗁得船上的女人和小孩哭了起來：然而年輕的漢子還是不屈服，努力地搖着他的柴</p>
<p>船過去！</p>
<p>當保衛軒團丁板着臉孔回轉來時，我說止刻意識到這一幕「魚肉鄉民」的悲劇。</p>
<h3>魚與熊掌的選擇</h3>
<p>— 田花</p>
<p>「魚我所欲也，熊掌亦我所欲也，二者不可兼得，捨魚而取熊掌可也。」孟老夫子是這樣痛快地表白着自已的願望，這眞是他老先生心直口快的不可及處。當今之世，上自紳士淑女，下至販夫走卒，竸以辦外交的態度處世，都想一隻脚踏上兩條船，旣拿了這邊的魚，又不能忘情那邊的熊掌，他們運用了他們的小聰明，企圖「二者兼得」了。</p>
<p>考查這種人的看家本領是，不東也不西，不左也不右，只留在中間，坐收「漁人之利」。他們也許在東邊說說好話，却又同樣在西邊說一通|常以這種「面面光」的騎牆派的姿態出現在各種塲合中。</p>
<p>這種人眞是聰明的人麼？「騎牆」眞是一種好的「處世哲學」麼？永遠在一種麻木的平庸的取巧的生活中浪費自已的生命，絕沒有參加一方面的决心與奮力|這樣沒有生活熱情的蠕動着，眞是最理想的人生麼？</p>
<p>這回答應該是否定的。首先我要指出，這種聰明人大都是軟弱分子。一個弱者是難得有决斷力的，他們不得不在生活的矛看中，分裂了自已的人格爲二重的，本三重的···。不論是大事小事，他們是難於貫澈始終的；他們難得是「一」個人，今天在這裏說了這樣的話，明天在別處也許又作了和自已說的全不相合的事了。他們有時也許想往前走，可是又有一種不可抗的力量他們拖回來，他們也就廿心退後，不求進步了。</p>
<p>他們不能是一個（大丈夫），是旣不能「留芳百世」，也不能「遺世萬年」的。他們的目光只看見魚什麼的熊掌什麼的，大丈夫不大丈夫，自然也不在話下。</p>
<p>充滿了這樣的人的民族是不進取的民族，這種的民族組成的國家一定是不長進的國家，而我們的大中華民族恰好是這種不長進的大集合。怎末辦呢？我們不甘心呌民族墮落，國家淪亡那末我們就得想個法子掃盪這「暴棄自甘」·「投機取巧「的壞傾向，走上復興的偉大前途才對。我們得提供一些辦法才對。　　西諺說：「作一個决定，卽使是一個壞的决定也好。」這該是一個好的敎訓，在魚與熊掌並是又不可得兼的時候，這一句話應可以帮助我們選擇。</p>
<p>還有，外國古代聖人蘇格拉底也說過：「幹一下，卽使幹得最壞也不要緊」那末，我們也該幹一下，不管「幹」的結果使我們成一個「留芳百世」的英雄，或成一個「遺臭萬年」的大壞蛋都好|照新的眼光看，應該幹得像一個爲大衆服務者所幹的一樣才好。</p>
<p>爲了民族的利益，個人的成功，我們不能再「騎牆」，再像一個軟弱的人似的毫無决斷力，我們要像一個「在丈夫」一樣，捨棄一切投機取巧的小聰明，馬上和孟老夫子一樣痛快的决定取魚或取熊掌吧！</p>
<p>業餘信箱</p>
<h3>再也不能忍耐下去了</h3>
<p>高編者先生：</p>
<p>這事沉潛在我的腦海裏好久了，但總是不肯吐露，現在，可再也不能忍耐下去了，我想請你先生，費一刻寶貴的光陰，指示我一下，六年以前的一個初春，因爲家庭環境的突變，經濟困難，父親就和我打算人生中最重要的事，不久就和我訂了婚約。那時我的年紀還小，絲毫不知反對，所以就不聞不問的糊塗下去了。現在家裏已是訂了結婚的日子，在這時，我一顆光明潔白的心，開始戰慄了，請問你先生，這樣的事情，用甚麼方法能抵抗不結婚？假使和她離婚，用甚麼手續最適當？離婚對她名譽上有否倣碍？要補貼甚麼費用否？聽說，她也要和我提起離婚的條件，假使她提起的話，那末，我要甚麼補貼嗎？以上的種種，請先生細細的立刻指示我，我多多感激，我戰慄地在這兒等候你的佳音，祝福你先生康健。陸人孚上</p>
<p>答：你不知滿了二十歲沒有，要過了二十歲法律上纔算成年。父母代你訂立的婚約，你要在成年後，纔能向法院提出解約。這呌做解約，不是離婚，解約須經過法律手續，這你問律師好了。對她名譽有否損失，這有兩種看法；明達事理的人當然不會說她壞話，至於一班舊頭腦的人，那就難說了。不過世上做事，祇求合理，要使人人說好，原是很難辦到，他人不正當的批評，自可置之不理。貼補費用一層，要看對方是否因解約而有損失，有損失，當然是要的。</p>
<p>以上是答覆你幾個問題，現在家庭旣爲你擇定結婚日期，則第一步你應當先反對結婚，以後再說解約。譬如你是未成年，更應這樣子進行。至於如何反對，殊無一定方法可言，不過結婚是你自已的事，要你情願，你不情願，試問，家庭能把你鎖拿着去結婚麼！編者</p>
<h3>山水</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓先生</p>
<p>小說</p>
<h3>節母坊（四）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>不知在什麼時候，在那石牌坊的周圍，已經有好些小孩在呌喊着，他們也捉蟋蟀，他們用着一切惡劣字句駡人，這在時敏習慣中都是一班下賤的孩子。他們穿着破爛的褲子，赤膊而且赤脚，汚泥濺在背上和臉上。永遠不能磨滅的興奮掛在他們的臉上。然而他們是那兒來的呢？好像他們都沒有家似的。他不認識他們，從來沒有見過他們，但是他們却使時敏無限的羨慕。看罷，他們有的騎在那石牌坊前面的石獅子身上，一共是兩隻獅子兩隻象，他們在上面喊着呌着，無法無天的好不快樂。一種吸引爲敎時敏走近了他們，望着他們笑，自已也不自然的笑。那兩座石獅子，左一隻大概是雌的，因爲有一隻小獅在她的脚下，怪可愛的。右邊的一隻脚踏着一個石球，嘴裏還啣着一個小的球，只要用手指動一下，便可以轉動，掛在獅子的兩旁的兩隻象，看不出牠們的雄雌，都有一個長鼻子一直拖到牠們的脚下。而且牠們的背上都袱了一個花瓶，不知道是做什麽用的。不過最可愛的到還是狮子嘴裏的圓球，時敏很想去弄一弄，可是生得大矮，踮起脚来也摸不着的。於是他找着一根竹枝，插向獅子的嘴裏去。可是一個野孩子却毫無理由的奪去了他的竹枝，吆喝着幾乎使他哭出來。他不敢反抗，因爲他懂得自已是打他不過的。幸虧旁邊有一個更大的癩痢孩子，却抓着那人的辮子大駡：</p>
<p>「小狗子，你欺負他麼？回頭給他家裏知道了，告訴你的爸爸，我總看你」</p>
<p>父親要打爛你的屁股的。」</p>
<p>「他是誰呀？另有孩子在問着癩痢頭，癩痢頭説：」</p>
<p>「你不認識他麼？他是正輔公公的孫子喲。」</p>
<p>「哦！」一提起正輔公公的名字，誰不知道。他是一年四季住在省城裏的，省城隔這裏總有好幾百里路吧。幾百里，多麼遠呀，假使以大田到縣城的十幾里路作一比例的話，那眞是太遠了。聽說到省城去是要從鄱陽湖經過的，坐船浮過鄱陽湖，要走上一個多月。住在那麼遠的地方，已經使人覺得了不起，何况還是在那兒做官。所以大家對於正輔公公，一提來起就覺得像神仙似的。而現在這一個白凈凈的小孫，便是他的孩子，所以也有一種說不出的感覺，至少也是和摸牛屁股的孩子們大不相同的。</p>

<h3>談反宗敎迷信影片</h3>
<p>— 頑右</p>
<p>不久以前，在本刋上看到一篇題目爲（中國電影現在觀）的文章，當時復使�</p>
<p>我爲之感動。在那篇文章中，亞羣君對於中國電影作家提出了三點要求，除了反帝和反封建影片製作之外，還提出了反宗敎迷信影在目前之迫切的要求。</p>
<p>關於前者，差不多已是在屢次討論中而得着了結論，地此不欲多述，而後者反宗敎迷信之提出，確是很新鮮的而値得討論。</p>
<p>關於這一點，我們爲了證明其在目前之迫切的需要，不妨先就反面而加以事實之參考。卽是說，我們得先觀察宣傳宗敎迷信影片，在目前中國是估着何等地位。</p>
<p>無論如何，我們得承認，二年以前的火燒紅蓮寺等類似的影片，其表面雖作爲武俠影片而產生，但是實質上，其爲宗敎迷信之說敎的惡劣的存在，乃是無可否認的事實。自一二八而後的中國電影開始走上新的道路之後，那一類影片似乎已爲進步的觀衆所揚棄了，而銷聲匿迹起來。然而在難困的過程之中，對於那些作品乃是沒有方法一時淸算出去的，所以直到現在爲止，（卡昆岡）之類的天雷報主義的影片，仍是繼續不斷的產生出來。</p>
<p>當然，十分十爲宗敎敎宣傳的影片，也許中國並不會產生，這因爲宗敎的權威，並不成爲支配者的原故。然而時至今日，却又大大的不同，據說某公司已經拍了一部宣傳迷信的新聞片。原因很簡單，中國的現狀，已經由長期抵抗而入於心理抵抗，不，到現在簡直是取消抵抗，什麼也談不上，而且是自已不抵抗也要別人不抵抗。於是想到了假使別人不願死而要掙扎一下和話，那末不免是不利於已的，所以便將嗎啡灌下我們的咽喉，不識不知，你就不死也得死。　　就在這種政策之下，活佛大仙大大的活動起來，手敲木魚，口唸彌陀，如來大佛觀士音，甚至於著名的淫僧觀喜菩薩，亦下降人間，大發慈悲，超渡衆生；此生雖做亡國奴，爲的是生前作惡太多，今生應得如此惡報，所以做做亡國奴到也沒有什麼，到不如虔修來世，雖毀家亡國亦甘心。||這種現象，該是每一個稍有血性的人，誰都會感覺痛心疾首的罷。可不是麼，士大夫賣國求榮，而要求我們老百姓俱死，此是何種境地？</p>
<p>因此，事實俱在，我想凡是不願做亡國奴不願死的良心的電影藝術們，應當敏感的覺察到這種危機，以其救國救民（自然也是救自已）的熱情，製作反宗敎迷信的影片。關於這一方面，自然得强調在因迷信而亡國滅種的一方面。而更廣泛的，絕對和科學背道而馳的迷信，也應當爲科學的人們揚棄的吧。而且，我們得知道宗敎迷信，完全是封建的產物，中古帝王常怕百姓反叛而以宗敎迷信作爲普遍的麻醉，這是極明顯的事實，因此，假使我們相信，我們的時代决不會開倒車回到中古代去，我們更得打擊這種反時代的怪現象。</p>
<p>電影作家們，我們要求着正確的反宗敎迷信影片。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「多角戀愛」</h3>
<p>— 丹楓</p>
<p>WerenotDrssing|國泰「多角戀愛」會給予人們以極輕微而似淸烟一般的印象。我曾說過，藝術家都中聰明人，而美國的電影藝人尤爲聰明絕頂。譬如說劇作者他就居然在理想中浮出一個荒島，而且是少男少女，載歌載舞，「芳草如茵，落英繽紛」，於是乎理想中的荒島，幾乎一變而爲仙島了。</p>
<p>關於這一方面，我想用不着再强調的來說什麼逃避現實，或者是詩人的夢囈，反正看膩片的朋友們一定可以在這一影片從新獲得煩膩的感覺，至於快樂的成份，自然是很少的。</p>
<p>平克考貝的低音唱歌，我們在好些影片中已經領敎得够了。所謂輕妙的情歌是他特長，有時可以使人陶醉有如飯了多量的葡萄酒，然而這不過是對於那些在情海愛河中的，哥兒小姐，有如此功效，另一方面，如欲在他的歌唱中找着一種激昂慷慨的刺戟，乃是不會有的事。軟柔柔嬌媚無力，便是他的特長，也是多角戀愛的特長。</p>
<p>羅曼斯，虛無飄渺的羅曼斯。可惜夢幻中的仙境，已經不爲積極的人們所憧憬！</p>
<h3>「亡命鴛鴦」評</h3>
<p>— 可熾</p>
<p>FugitiveLovets|大光明雖然「亡命鴛鴦」也和「亡命者」一樣的描寫一個亡命者）的亡命，但是「亡命鴛」）沒有如「亡命者」那般的暴露了資本主義黑暗的面目，只是警察的追逐和亡命者的在危急時閙戀愛的把戲。</p>
<p>「亡命鴛鴦」的劇作者要觀衆同情於亡命者寶德，容觀地告訴了觀衆警察的如何兇狠，法律的剝奪人民的自由，連二倘人的戀愛也不能不因爲追捕緊急而被强迫分散了，最後，寶德在風雪中奮不顧身的救了兒童，然而還免不了要遭逮捕，這很可以燃燒起觀衆對於不公正的法律的憤怒，然而，很不幸，編劇者在結束却來上一個自相矛盾的說明法律公正的Happyenjing，整個的劇情都給它破壞了。</p>
<p>導演RichardBoleslavcky的手法很成功，當然它的成功也大半因爲了編劇者的利用了Action來推展劇情的帮助；一連串的刺激打動了每個觀衆的心弦。</p>
<p>演員自以勞勃脫門高茂萊與曼琪伊文絲爲最佳。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>「漁光曲」雜寫</h3>
<p>— 沅芷</p>
<p>喧傳已久的「漁光曲」，終於在十四號起，在金城影戲院正式映出了。</p>
<p>「漁光曲」的劇情，可以說結構得很完善的。這裏所包含的有各種不同的形式，都搬上了銀幕。其中有榨取階級的資本家和地主，也有被剝削階級的漁民和工人；有富人們的奸滑狡黠，也有窮苦者的同情互助。···一切的一切，可以說把資本主義尖銳化，和封建農村的破產，都整個扼要暴露了出來。</p>
<p>導演的手法，甚爲巧妙。同樣是和別的影片般有着封稱的鏡頭，可是這裏却高明得多。還有前後呼應吻合的幕面，更給人們以深刻的印象。如薛綺雲畫了個心，梁月波在中間盡了個＄；後來二人把何仁齊的財產捲逃時，薛綺雲在報紙上畫了＄暗示月波，月波便在外面添了個心形，這些小地方，都感人極深。</p>
<p>演員方面，王人美，湯天繡，尙冠武等，都表演得很努力。韓蘭根，雖然有許多人對他都深印了滑稽者的印像，於悲壯時或難免流於浮滑，可是以劇中人的性格來說，扮瘋子是他最適當沒有了。</p>
<p>演員的飾窮人的鏡頭，都極逼眞，再沒有以前許多片子裏的窮人還燙髪等弊端。「下略」</p>
<h3>「漁光曲」觀後感</h3>
<p>— 漢川</p>
<p>本片的題材及作者的思想，都有其特到之處。其佈置的周密，攝影角度的適宜和靜物的秀美，的却非其他中國影片所能比擬。致於華洋漁業公司失敗的主要原因不在帝國主義經濟支配下，而歸到總經理與某富翁之後妻携欵潛逃，以此種觀念上之錯誤，對於觀衆的蒙蔽，影響一定很大，縱使劇作者欲以此暴露出某富翁的昏瞆及其糜爛的生活。</p>
<p>全片的演出雖然同「都會的早晨」一樣的手法，不過比較進步得多了。像小猴對鏡子自相問答，以及拿切菜刀欲砍老頭兒幾個畫面都可以證明導演者煞費苦心，而小貓在三次「第一次例外」不同的環境下唱「漁光曲」，更顯出得凄楚欲絕。猶其是最後的一次。</p>
<p>導演者對於小技巧處，的却非常的注意。如總經理燃火柴給某富翁，而經理燃火柴給總經理，以及職員燃火柴給經理，以此細微之處，便表現出都會中的處僞。至於小貓恐怕他哥哥對母親直說沒有工做，因此打了小猴一下，終於含淚問「哥哥你痛嗎？」的懊傷語。再者幾個對比，亦演出非常動情。幾幕「吞刀」一賣拳頭」都充分地現出都會中要錢不惜命的吃飯問題。不過小猴兄妹得了冨翁之子的救濟，以致舅父受傷，兄妹被誣爲盜，而盲母亦因此被火焚死，雖然增强觀衆的刺激不少，但是事實上沒有如此巧合的。最後小猴因營養不足而死亡，這可以看出中國乳母因爲自已生活的問題，以致自已的兒子不能永壽，而遺給觀衆絕大的憾觸「下略」</p>
<h3>「大富之家」觀後感</h3>
<p>— 雲鬥</p>
<p>在帝國主義者鐵蹄下掙扎的我們，因不能不對於所受一切現實的痛苦，發生懷疑，也無形中引起了一種反抗的意識||這意識的結晶，就是某種主義之誔生。至於任何主義的實行，那另是一個問題。</p>
<p>沉淪中的我國，當然不能需要那些忘却現在的麻醉品，而必須找求「其言足以興」的興奮劑，常常提撕着那種反抗意識之警醒。</p>
<p>假使依據「史」的觀察，那末二十世紀的現在，是十九世紀的過去之全部承襲者，因了前世紀中資本生產的發揚，與夫科學文化的昌明，封建制度及君主政治，就得整個沒落，所以吾們對於時代的遺蛻物，加一觀摩，也可領悟了遷變上一切因果關係，細細推論起來，又是不免那一大堆老調，地理上的開闢，科學上的發明，實業上的革命，農村經濟的衰落，國際貿易的激進，金融通匯的操縱，貴族政治的崩潰，資本主義的抬頭，以及人口集中於機械，生產膨脹，原料缺乏，殖民地|生產資本的尾閭|之征服，國際巿塲之竸逐，甚致人口過剩，生產過剩，資本過剩，終於世界經濟史上所未見的大恐慌，同時各國攘攘地準備，下一次大屠殺，好像除了戰爭，世界沒有出路似的，一九三五年也好，一九三六年更不壞。</p>
<p>這些鐵一般的事實，誰也不能否認，而披「大富之家」一片宣說無餘了，眞不愧是一九三四年冠軍之作。它那裏告訴吾們，一八一五年滑鐵盧一役。勝者不是威靈登公爵。敗者不是拿破崙，而爲君主統治與資力威力互相手搏的生死關頭。終於資本主義，創業垂統，儼然爲現代文明之太祖高皇帝了。它又告訴吾們，人和人的關係怎樣，虐與殺，出自天性，强者所望於弱者，絕對不是相同的尊嚴的生活，它又告訴吾們平等僅囿於權利和階級，「Rliveleged」而「不平等」不僅屬於「色」的問題。</p>
<p>雖然全劇含蓄的意識，是那樣嚴重，在演出上，是那樣的生動而富於趣味。喬治亞立斯，竟是無可非議的一位天才老輩，而導演之高明的手腕，也令人驚服。末一幕中，彩色的調和，可稱爲電影藝術的無上收穫。更加以狄斯耐的「蚱蜢與螞蟻」五彩短片，更令人感慨係之深思猛省。此片誠爲本年難得之妙品，故非但應該獲得最高的評價，亦占有吾人思想上絕大地位。</p>
<h3>「三姊妹」簡評</h3>
<p>— 保生</p>
<p>「三姊妹」是集了幾個新舊演員合作的，現在讓吾來簡評一下吧！</p>
<p>這部作品，是一幕關於三姊妹曲折的羅曼史的描寫，和叙述一簡三鵰的戀愛騙子，終於遭受了最後一個難堪的報復，對戀愛至上主義者及玩弄女性的男性，給予一個强有力的攻擊，對於現今社會裏的迷盲於戀愛的靑年男女們，給予一個相當的糾正。</p>
<p>這片的攝影，光線淸晰，尙稱相當的角度也甚準確。演員如嚴月嫺，胡蝶，孫敏，等所飾的角色，也恰合他們的個性，因此他們都能充分的表情。又新進的趙丹，林莉，鐘懿等三位的表情，動作，也很優美，確當。</p>
<p>總之，「三姊」）是獲有相當成功的作品，是迷惑在戀愛中的靑年男女們的南針！</p>
<h3>劉莉影病急煞二人</h3>
<p>集滑稽人才大成的聯華二廠諷刺喜劇「酒色財氣」攝製以來已成十分之七，却不料還有五六天戲便全部攝竣的時候女角劉莉影突然患病，以致工作停滯下去了好幾天。導演譚友六當然煞急萬分，而高威廉和劉繼羣却比導演還要急。因爲高最遲在六月初旬便要趁船回廣東去給他的爸爸稱觴上壽，女角的病如愈，馬上便可以工作，於是他們雖歸心似箭也不能走開，幸得一天劉莉影居然能够力疾到廠，於是偉大的自搭內景T形馬路，便在那天一口氣拍完。老劉立刻去趁火車，高呢，連夜收拾行裝轉天的早晨離開上海了。</p>

<h3>海枯石爛「ReglstetedNurse」「九」</h3>
<p>— 擷華</p>
<p>最近的新發展，更是從而秘密起。於是大家都知道朋登是個有夫之婦，而心理病院中的一個新病人，就是朋登的丈夫。朋呢。她自已用忙碌的工作，來遣散自已胸中的愁悶。她在大過道中遇見了佛蘭克。昨天她還和他說笑，呌他要注意路章，可是今天她竟低着走過去了，連他的手輪車向她衝過來，她都沒有看見。佛蘭克縐着眉有些莫名其妙。但他却又注意到她的臉上罩满了一層的愁霜，必定有什麽不幸的事情，才使他這样的。他不覺自已摇着頭咨嗟不已，心想這様美麗的一個女郎，怎麽受得了這許多磨折···愛塞兒端了一個食品盤·齊巧走了過來。她走到佛蘭克的前面，就站定了，和佛蘭克一齊望着朋登的後形，直等到她珊姍地轉彎不見了。愛塞兒歎着氣道：「可憐的朋。運氣實在太壞了。」佛艾蘭克接着道：（塡是運氣太壞了。那個傑姆斯朋登什麼時候開刀呢？「愛塞兒道：」大概還有一個鐘頭吧。）她說完了，就端了盤子走開了。</p>
<p>等到愛塞兒走了，佛蘭克獨自一個人留在過道裏。他眉頭縐着，有所深思地半嚮，忽然他毅然地决定了，就手搖着車子，怱怱地去到一間病房裏，他進了病房，看見傑姆斯朋登躺在床上，眼向窗外張望着。剛才朋登已經來過，他向她說了千萬對不起她的話。他知她這幾年來所受的苦處，但是海特威醫生說不要緊的，會治得好的，但是他却十分害怕，不知道腦筋裏的黑暗，何日何時再重臨···朋登走了不過一兩分鐘，佛蘭克突然間闖了進來。他開口就問道：我來看看你，好不好？你和我是同一個看護，那個看護實在太好了。）傑姆斯淡然地說道：「唔，不差」。佛蘭克將軍子推到傑姆斯的床前，用低低的聲音告訴傑姆斯道；（那個女郎是應當享受些幸福的，不過天不由人，着實太可憐了|你知道，她的男人太不成話了，「你聽見過沒有？傑姆靜臥着一言不發地，聽着他繼續地講着：「實在太不幸了。她並不愛她的男人，你要曉得。他是一雙舊鞋，不久就要被擲掉的，因爲遲早之間，她總要和他離婚的。不過她現在還沒有想到這件事，她還不肯這樣做。眞糟透了，你說是不是？」傑姆斯默然答應道：「太糟了」。佛蘭克又滔滔不絕地說道：你還知其一而不知其二哩。你知道，她已另外愛上了一個人|還是這裏的一個醫生哩。那是一個很好的人，但却使那看護更爲難了，眞越來越糟，你說是不是？」傑姆斯聽了道：這個我倒不知道。」佛蘭克又装作完全是閒談的神氣道：「那是千眞萬確的。他們俩是非常相愛的。你到這裏來是常住的嗎？」他又問了一聲。傑姆斯的眼睛又望着窗外看着，全城的風景一一可數。他一回兒慢慢地說道：（恐怕不見得吧···」佛蘭克聽了這句話，竟雙手搖着車子，退了出來。他覺得他已經盡了他的職。那睡在床上的人，倒也不是完全沒有腦筋的，他覺着。（未完）</p>

<h3>Central Military Academy Holds Graduation Ceremony, Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, and Others Deliver Speeches</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Military Academy held the graduation ceremony for the second class of the Officer Training Course, the graduation ceremony for the second class of the Higher Education Course, and the promotion ceremony for the tenth class of students at 8:00 AM on the seventeenth. More than 3,000 students were present. Shao Yuanchong, representing the Central Party Headquarters; Deng Jiayan, representing the National Government; Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan; Dai Jitao, Tang Shengzhi, and Zhu Peide, members of the school affairs committee; and Chuan Zuoyi, Cao Haosen, Zhou Yawei, Zhou Bin, Chen Liang, and Chen Zhuo, as well as 500 guests, including representatives of graduates from military academies across the country, attended. Zhang Zhizhong, the school's director of education, and Li Minghao, the director of the education department, took care of everything at the scene. At exactly 8:00 AM, President Chiang, accompanied by his staff, aides, secretaries, and adjutants Xuan Tiewu and Deng Wenyu, walked from the military academy's official residence to the venue amidst the melodious music of the military band. He then announced the opening of the meeting. After President Chiang performed the ceremony, he issued certificates and awards. Cheng Gang, the top graduate of the Higher Education Course, and Zeng Yuansan, the top graduate of the Military Training Course, received certificates and awards. After the certificates and awards were issued, Shao Yuanchong, representing the Central Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, roughly stating that the purpose of education is to train people to be useful, to be fit for the times, and to be able to strive for the nation. Therefore, when the nation's survival is in danger, education should cultivate people who can strive and sacrifice for the nation. When the nation is safe, education should cultivate people who can seek the nation's progress and development. In a country, if most people can be educated to have morality, knowledge, and ability, the country will surely survive and develop. If most people lack morality, knowledge, and ability, the country's future will be very dangerous. The Central Military Academy has been established for ten years. In these ten years, the Premier's meticulous management and the President's arduous and resolute leadership in the face of difficulties, this great spirit, is precisely to make all students aware of the importance of their mission, understand the danger of the Chinese nation today, and be able to take on this very difficult task to complete the responsibility of national rejuvenation. In the current dangerous environment of the nation, there are several points that we should pay special attention to in education. First, we must recognize the mission of us Chinese. Second, we must complete the task of the Chinese National Revolution. Third, we must pay attention to the spirit of knowing shame and waging war. Therefore, all the students of the Central Military Academy must recognize the importance of their own responsibilities and the danger of the current situation in China, and strive to acquire profound knowledge and develop sound intellectual abilities at all times. When they leave the school and serve in the military, take on the task of national defense, or strive for the nation, they must still strive to increase their knowledge and abilities at all times and promote the national spirit. Only in this way can we complete our greatest and ultimate task, and only then will we live up to the Premier's deep hopes and the President's sincere guidance to everyone for the past ten years. Therefore, today, in this grand ceremony, I sincerely wish that all of you can shoulder the responsibilities that Chinese citizens should bear in the task of revitalizing the nation and the mission entrusted to you by the Central Military Academy, actively develop the spirit of knowing shame and waging war, and become powerful combatants in the nation's survival battle to determine the great task of national rejuvenation. Next, Deng Jiayan, representing the National Government, delivered a speech, roughly stating that everyone should follow President Chiang's instructions to be hardworking and enduring, to be courteous, righteous, honest, and honorable, and to strive to revitalize the nation. The revival of a nation must have strength, a strong national power, and then it can resist insults and defend the country. I hope that all students will, from today onward, continue to work hard under the leadership of President Chiang to revitalize the nation and wash away national humiliation. Wang Jingwei delivered a speech, roughly stating that the mission, direction, and path of the National Revolution, and the stages that must be passed through, have been indicated to us by the Premier, guiding all comrades of our party to move forward. After we have identified the direction of the revolution, we must step by step overcome the difficulties and hardships. The Chinese Revolution must have military force. Internally, we must seek unity and implement doctrine. Externally, we must seek freedom and equality. We cannot forget our mission because of economic backwardness or cultural backwardness. We have four thousand years of culture and the Premier's instructions on the great path. We must endure hardship and break through difficulties. Following the Premier's legacy, we must recognize the revolutionary path and promote it under the leadership of the President, guiding 400 million compatriots to the path of universal harmony. Tang Shengzhi then delivered a speech, roughly stating that what the President has shown to everyone is what revolutionary soldiers should follow. I would like to contribute a point to my fellow students, that is, we must always be at ease and fulfill our duties, each to the best of their ability. Only when every soldier is at ease and fulfills their duties, under the leadership of the President, can we complete the task of revitalizing the nation. Chuan Zuoyi then delivered a speech, roughly stating that the country's current situation is difficult and requires concentrated efforts to overcome the difficulties. We soldiers should especially concentrate our efforts to lead the people, be pioneers for the people, and sacrifice for the country. We should not only sacrifice our flesh and blood, but also sacrifice our reputation to preserve the country. We should also do this. Following Chairman Chiang's revolutionary spirit, character, and morality, pass it on from one to ten, from ten to one hundred, so that the entire army can work together and strive together under the guidance of the Chairman. He Yingqin sent a speech from Beiping, which stated: The state of the country is in danger, now to the extreme. Saving the country and preserving it is the responsibility of our generation. Since you are all revolutionary soldiers, the responsibility you bear for the country and the nation is even greater. In the future, whether you serve in the army or continue your studies at the school, you must abide by the school motto of love and sincerity, promote the virtues of courtesy, righteousness, honesty, and honor, and not be lazy or arrogant, but move forward bravely. Only in this way can we live up to the country's intention to establish schools and cultivate talents, and complete the great task of national rejuvenation. Space is short, but sentiments are long. I can't express everything. I only wish that you all will work together. President Chiang delivered a speech, roughly stating that after the students leave the school, they must fulfill the responsibilities of a student. After the students are promoted, they must deepen their knowledge to save the country. Everyone must recognize that what they have learned before is firstly not enough and secondly does not meet the requirements of the revolution. After the students graduate, they must follow the ancient adage ("All kinds of things in the past are like yesterday's death, and all kinds of things in the future are like today's birth"). We must do things and study knowledge in this way to achieve daily progress and daily renewal, to meet our requirements. China has its own environment and its own historical spirit. The army must have new knowledge and a new spirit to transform the country and complete its mission. After graduation, lead many people, so that they can be trained by us, share our lives and deaths, share our hardships, and protect the country and defend the people. Everyone must strive for the country, for doctrine, for the Premier, and for the school, to earn glory and complete the revolutionary cause. Dai Chuanxian delivered a speech, roughly stating that no matter what kind of knowledge, there is a common rule, that is, those who seek shallow knowledge should go from outside the school to inside the school, and those who seek profound knowledge should go in the opposite direction, from the countryside to the city, from the city to the countryside, where few people go to learn. Everyone is a teacher, and everywhere is a lecture hall. Military knowledge is the same. We must do this until we die, and turn what we have learned into practical use. What the President just brought up to tell everyone is the secret to creating a new China and a new civilization. I hope that everyone will firstly not think that they have learned enough, and secondly, bring the knowledge from books and make practical use of it, and then dedicate it to the country and the nation. This is your responsibility. I hope that everyone will work hard after leaving the school. Student representative Wu Shaozhou replied, roughly stating that today we are very grateful for the instructions from the President and all the school officials. On behalf of all the students, the student representative sincerely accepts the instructions from all the leaders and the President. The students have truly recognized the Premier's Three Principles of the People and truly recognized the revolutionary leader. In the future, we still hope that you teachers and the President will give us instructions at any time. After the student representative finished speaking, they sang the school song and took a photo. The ceremony was completed, and the clock had already struck ten. (Seventeenth Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Jinan) Han said that his impression of this trip was good. Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, and the leaders of the provinces they passed through were all working hard to revitalize the country, so everything in the provinces was progressing. What made people have hope for the future of the country was that Chiang was working hard to unite sincerely and revitalize the country. Recently, after the suppression of the Jiangxi bandits, there will be major reforms in all military and political affairs in the country. As for this province, I feel that everything is not good. Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei both said they were satisfied, which is due to Chiang Kai-shek's and Wang Jingwei's magnanimity and tolerance, and not that it is really good. The more grand the reception, the more I feel ashamed and have nowhere to put myself. Asking my conscience, can I be at peace? What can win general understanding is that I sincerely want to do well. Zhang Yipeng has a new look after returning to China, as if he were a different person. (Seventeenth Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Relief for the Fishing Industry</h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>My country is bounded by the sea in the southeast. From Liaoning to Guangdong, there are seven provinces along the coast. The coastline is more than 8,600 kilometers long, and the area of coastal fishing grounds is more than twice that of Japan. There are abundant aquatic organisms, with more than 3,000 species, encompassing both cold and warm water types. There are more than 300,000 fishermen nationwide, and no less than one million people rely on fishing as a supplementary occupation.</p>
<p>The relationship between the fishing industry and the national economy is extremely close, which needs no further elaboration. However, in recent years, the national fishing industry has been severely hit by natural disasters and man-made calamities, and is on the verge of lifelessness. The way to provide relief should be carefully studied.</p>
<p>Firstly, the administration of the fishing industry should be promoted. For thousands of years, my country has been based on agriculture and has not paid attention to the fishing industry. Even if there is fisheries administration, it is mostly a disguised form of levying taxes and duties, without knowing to exhaust the responsibility of protection and promotion. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the government authorities have repeatedly promulgated regulations to encourage the fishing industry and protect fishermen against theft, but they are all empty words and ineffective. On the contrary, the collection of fishery taxes and fishing taxes is endless. In March of the 20th year of the Republic, although the National Government explicitly ordered the abolition of these taxes, local malpractices were still difficult to eliminate completely. Recently, the Ministry of Industry, which is in charge of fisheries administration, has gradually realized the need to correct long-standing abuses and started to improve the situation. However, due to financial constraints, it has not been able to develop much. For example, the Marine Fisheries Administration Bureaus and Fisheries Improvement Committees in the three regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, Shandong, Fujian, and Guangdong were closed down shortly after their establishment due to the exhaustion of funds. After the closure, although a Fisheries Protection Office was established in Shanghai, its scale was far less grand than expected. If the central financial budget for this year does not increase the funds for the Ministry of Industry, then even the fisheries protection equipment cannot be improved, let alone other aspects. The Ministry of Industry recently announced plans to establish fisheries police bureaus in various provinces and cities, and to order seven new fishing vessels from Germany. All of these require huge sums of money. However, in order to protect the fishing industry and prevent cross-border fishing, they are necessary measures. It is hoped that the central government can promote their realization.</p>
<p>Secondly, the system of fishermen's loan offices should be popularized. The fishermen in my country are mostly troubled by economic difficulties. Moreover, because fishing is a seasonal industry, they can rely on fishing for a living during the spring and summer fishing season. In autumn and winter, when the weather is cold and there are no fish, they have to beg for help from wealthy households. It is said that the interest on loans is at least 40%, knowing that it is like cutting flesh to heal sores, but they have no choice. Now, fishermen's loan offices have been established in nine counties, including Jiangsu and Shanghai. Fishermen can borrow money without interest and are allowed to repay in installments. This is a good and well-intentioned law that should be promoted to benefit more people.</p>
<p>Thirdly, aquatic education should be reformed. Aquatic education in my country has a history of more than 20 years. There are aquatic schools in Tianjin, Wusong, Dinghai, Xiamen, Liaoning, and other places. However, except for the one in Tianjin, which has been changed to a specialized school, the rest are all at the level of senior high schools. There are very few students, and all schools suffer from financial constraints, simple equipment, and a lack of teachers. It is said that one-third of the drivers of Japanese fishing steamships are graduates of aquatic schools. In my country, unskilled fishermen fill the ranks of fishing vessels. Very few aquatic talents can apply what they have learned. This is why our fishing technology is inferior to others.</p>
<p>Fourthly, fishermen and merchants should cooperate in good faith. Conflicts and bloodshed often occur between fishing villages in my country. Fish merchants also invent various names to collect illegal levies from fishermen. There are many types of illegal levies. The most common in all regions is the "deduction fee." In Jiangsu and Zhejiang, there are dock fees and public channel fees in Shanghai, and god donations and heaven-sent donations in Dinghai and Zhapu. In Zhenhai, there are god and public channel fees. Some are outright extortion, while others use the name of gods for personal gain. The way to remedy this is for the government to divide fishing areas, prohibit illegal levies, and appoint appropriate personnel to be responsible for education and guidance in each area. On the merchant side, the key is to be considerate of fishermen. The success or failure of fisheries cooperation depends on this.</p>
<p>Fifthly, aquatic research should be promoted. Researching aquatic products is essential for developing the fishing industry. In recent years, although research institutions have been established in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Guangdong provinces, the results have been limited due to the frequent troubles in the country. This has led to a lack of research into the statistical data for the extraordinarily abundant aquatic products in our country, and we are unaware of being exploited and plundered. How pitiful is this! Moreover, at a time when calls for fisheries control are rampant, it is especially necessary to pay attention to research and investigation first. Recently, some people have advocated the establishment of a national fisheries research institute, which should be planned and established by the National Economic Commission. This is indeed essential for the country. Sixthly, the invasion of fishing by Japanese vessels and the dumping of Japanese fish should be dealt with severely. In the situation where my country's fishing industry is lifeless, what worries us most is the invasion by the Japanese. Japanese vessels invade our territorial waters and fish at will. The stolen catch is either transported to Dalian first and then transshipped to Shanghai, or sold by Chinese traitors, disguised as domestic products, and evading customs duties. This not only harms the livelihoods of our fishermen, but also infringes upon our national sovereignty. Such actions are truly infuriating. The Fisheries Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has a plan to expand overseas fisheries on a large scale in the past two years. The fishing vessels dispatched not only seek to invade economic interests, but also serve as reconnaissance on the sea, in order to create a strong wartime intelligence network. Due to our country's geographical proximity and national weakness, our territorial waters and fishing rights will undoubtedly be further infringed upon in the future. In order to protect the livelihoods of fishermen and maintain the authority of an independent country, we must deal with them severely and actively resist. Otherwise, not only will there be no bright future for our country's fishing industry, but also the national economy will be further plunged into a situation from which it will never recover. This can be stated definitively.</p>

<p>Chiang Zhizhi Telegraphed, Reporting that Regent Reting Supports the Central Government</p>
<h3>Mongolian Committee Orders Liu Wenhui to Revise Proposed Measures</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Musong's aide, Chiang Zhizhi, telegraphed from Lhasa, stating that after arriving in Lhasa, he had met with Regent Reting and briefly explained the Central Government's concern for the political situation in Tibet and its efforts to support the local Tibetan authorities and improve the welfare of monks and laypeople. Reting expressed his support for the Central Government's good intentions. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian Committee believes that Liu Wenhui's telegram regarding the handling of the restoration of the Dajin Temple and the accommodation of invading Kham lamas, as well as the issue of the garrison location of the Kangzang Army, is still not in line with the five principles drafted by the Central Government. It has telegraphed Liu again, instructing him to consult with the Tibetan representative Jueji on the revision of the relevant measures and submit them to the Central Government for review. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<h3>President Wang Replies to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Abolition of Excessive Taxes and Levies Proceeding Smoothly</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang replied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's telegram, stating that the telegram reported on public opinion, that the addition of taxes and surcharges to land taxes would never be allowed again, and that the abolition of excessive taxes and levies was proceeding smoothly. The government has established a Committee for the Consolidation of Local Taxes and Levies, and a Committee for the Supervision of Taxes and Levies. The order of consolidation measures includes the elimination of those that harm the public interest, those that harm transportation, and those that unfairly tax imports from other regions for the benefit of one region. All such taxes and levies will be abolished in stages within the second half of this year. Shanghai is the economic center of the country, and the expectations of the members of the Chamber of Commerce are deeply reflective of public opinion. It is hoped that the whole country, from top to bottom, will be mindful of the current crisis, fulfill their responsibilities within their respective spheres, and work together to restore the national economy. This is what the government strives to do day and night. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<h3>Japanese National Defense Policy Outline: Investigating Financial Resources in North and South China; Saving National Living Expenses to Prepare for War</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The contents of the national defense policy that Land Minister Hayashi plans to announce in early July are roughly as follows: (1) Expanding the capacity of military industry to the highest level, that is, employing the same number of workers as in wartime, and not conscripting those who should not be mobilized in wartime; (2) Accumulating wartime military supplies and raw materials, and methods of obtaining them; (3) Saving the necessities of national life to the greatest extent possible; (4) Methods of cracking down on anti-national movements and military espionage in wartime; (5) Rapidly strengthening the air force; (6) Investigating the distribution of military supplies and raw materials in Manchuria, North China, and South China; (7) The domestic economic organization should be based on the revised Outline of the Imperial Economy drafted by General Araki, requiring the financial cliques to make sacrifices for the war. This is the most difficult point, so it will be considered further after public opinion is criticized. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador Visits Hirota: Talks Last for Five Hours; Ruble Issue to be Negotiated in Moscow; Requests Suppression of White Russian Activities in Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Russian Ambassador to Japan Yurenev visited Foreign Minister Hirota at 1:30 p.m. on the 16th and held talks for five and a half hours. The Russian ambassador first argued to Hirota about the form of negotiations on the issue of Japanese-Russian exchange rates, arguing that the negotiations should be conducted in Moscow by Japanese Ambassador Ota and Counselor Sakata, and that Japanese business representatives should not participate. Hirota responded that this issue was originally a matter between Soviet Russia and Japanese businessmen, and that because the negotiations between the two sides had failed, diplomats were negotiating on their behalf. Moreover, the results of the exchange rate determination would have the greatest impact on Japanese businessmen (because the national organization of the Russian side is different, there is no problem), so it is appropriate for business representatives to participate in the negotiations. The two sides discussed without result and decided to discuss it again at a later date. Secondly, Foreign Minister Hirota raised the issue of the Russian side shooting at Japanese ships and the Russian side's propaganda of a Japanese-Russian war, and requested that the Russian government take a cautious attitude and crack down on rumors. After the Russian ambassador clarified these issues, he mentioned the recent unpleasant issue at the Russian embassy in Japan and requested that the Japanese government suppress the activities of White Russians in Japan. The Foreign Minister said that this kind of event exists everywhere, and then listed the facts such as Russians throwing stones at the Japanese Embassy in Moscow, the actions of the Russian secret police, Japanese students engaging in propaganda in Moscow, and Russians opening letters from the Japanese government to the Russian ambassador, hoping that both sides would jointly crack down on these malpractices. Finally, the Foreign Minister urged the Russian ambassador to make concessions on the issue of the China Eastern Railway. The Russian ambassador replied that he would return to his government for instructions and reply to the matter later. The meeting then ended. (United Press dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<h3>Italian-German Compromise: Countering the Russian-French Group; Germany's Freedom to Deploy Military Equipment Receives Italian Support; Russia's Proposal to Conclude a Security Pact is Rejected by Germany; Italian Prime Minister Said to be Visiting German Chancellor in July</h3>
<p>Rome: Today's Italian newspaper, *Il Popolo d'Italia*, published an important article by Gaeta, the mouthpiece of Prime Minister Mussolini, stating that the meeting between the Italian and German chancellors in Venice was initiated suddenly by German Chancellor Hitler. It also stated that the relationship between Germany and Russia has been very cold recently and is gradually becoming hostile, which occupied an important part of the two chancellors' talks. Germany believes that the French-Russian alliance is hostile, so on the eve of the Venice Conference, Soviet Russia proposed to Berlin the conclusion of an Eastern Locarno Pact, guaranteed by France, and participated in by Poland, Soviet Russia, Czechoslovakia, and Germany, but Berlin believed that this proposal involved group politics and rejected it on June 13. The article continued to say that Germany confirmed that the conclusion of the Disarmament Conference had made Germany free from any prohibited undertakings, and that Germany could freely deploy military equipment in accordance with its national defense needs. At the same time, Italy firmly believes that the compromise reached in Venice will gradually weaken Austrian terrorism, which Italians regard as a step towards peace and countering the group.</p>
<p>There is currently a rumor that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in order to promote his advocacy of personal contact, will travel to Bavaria in July to return the visit to German Chancellor Hitler. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>General Attention Focused on France: Secrets of the Meeting Difficult to Ascertain</h3>
<p>Rome: At present, general attention has shifted to France, hoping that France will take some action to break the disarmament deadlock. The French press criticizes the Venice compromise, mostly believing that the key to the whole problem lies in Vienna. *Le Peuple* claims that the bombs that exploded in Vienna will limit the scope of this compromise. *L'Oeuvre* predicts that one or two moderate National Socialists will join the Austrian cabinet. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Italian and German prime ministers met in Venice, and both sides maintained strict secrecy, so that people here cannot have any clear impression of this matter. Generally, it is believed that one thing must have been determined without a doubt, that is, Hitler, at Mussolini's request, has agreed to stop the National Socialist terrorist acts in Austria. Regarding the issue of disarmament, most people do not believe that Mussolini can make Germany change its tough attitude. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Stopping Terrorist Actions in Austria: The German Side Claims There Are Conditions Attached</h3>
<p>Rome: What is the meaning of the compromise reached in Venice? There are different explanations. The Italian side believes that Germany will no longer support the National Socialist movement in Austria, while the German side says that this matter has conditions attached. Although not explicitly stated, the recognition of the National Socialist movement is naturally included in the conditions. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Promise Can Secure the Austrian Situation: British Press Sees it as Beneficial to European Peace</h3>
<p>(London) The Sunday newspapers generally approve of the results of the talks between the Italian and German leaders in Venice. Because the British are extremely worried about the Austrian issue, it is generally believed that this matter can be expected to be resolved after the Venice meeting. *The Sunday Times* said that the results of the meeting between the two dictators naturally have their important benefits. What Hitler has obtained is not as much as what he has given to others, but this is not surprising, because Germany's economic difficulties are becoming increasingly serious, and Hitler's prestige in Germany is not as high as before. The main point of the Italian-German compromise is Hitler's permission to respect Austria's independence. This seems to be a huge concession from Germany to Italy, but in reality it does not have much weight, because Germany has many things to do outside of Austria. Hitler's promise, regardless of its value to Germany, is of great importance to Europe, because Austria's turmoil is the biggest factor in European unrest. With Hitler's promise, people can feel at ease. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Italian-German Obstacles Completely Removed: Written Agreements Not Desired</h3>
<p>Rome: Today's *La Stampa* published an article written by the newspaper's editor-in-chief, detailing the understanding reached between Hitler and Mussolini. According to the article, a written agreement is currently not possible, nor is it desired. However, all factual and ideal obstacles have been removed. Germany's equal status must be achieved. The governments of the two countries have long agreed on this. When Germany's equal status is recognized by all countries, Germany can rejoin the League of Nations. In politics, no one can keep Germany permanently under control. European politics cannot make progress without Germany, which is represented by Hitler. Recently, Italy and Germany have had different opinions on the Austrian issue. Now Hitler and Mussolini have agreed that Austria must be independent, so Austria should be able to return to normal. The economic cooperation in the Danube River basin has also been resolved through consultations in Venice. (National News Agency dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister to Visit London in Early July to Seek a Breakthrough in the Disarmament Deadlock</h3>
<p>(Paris) After the representatives of Britain, France, and the United States reached a compromise on the disarmament issue on the 7th of this month, British Prime Minister MacDonald believed that since Britain and France could cooperate sincerely in Geneva, it would be more beneficial to the relations between the two countries if French Foreign Minister Barthou could visit Britain. He ordered Lord Privy Seal Eden to invite him in Geneva, and Barthou agreed. Foreign Minister Barthou has now decided to depart for Britain on the afternoon of July 8 and meet with MacDonald in London on the 9th and 10th. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Lord Privy Seal Eden delivered a speech in Borrow, Scotland, reiterating Britain's loyalty to the League of Nations and its policy of peace. Conservative Party member Churchill delivered a speech in Wanstead, fiercely attacking Germany's rearmament and demanding that Britain strengthen its air force. Aviation Minister Londonderry delivered a speech in Dundalk, and Undersecretary of State for Air Sassoon delivered a speech in Thetford, saying that if other countries do not reduce their air forces, Britain will have to increase its air force.

<h3>Hitler's Envoy Arrives in Paris to Discuss Disarmament Issues; France Will Advise Germany to Return to Geneva; Security Committee Scheduled to Meet Today</h3>
<p>(Paris) Ribbentrop, who had been sent by Hitler to London and Rome in May to discuss disarmament issues, has recently arrived here again in a private capacity. He met with Foreign Minister Barthou for a long time, and they talked about various issues related to the relations between France and Germany. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Ribbentrop's visit to Paris on behalf of Hitler in a semi-official capacity was completely unheard of beforehand. Ribbentrop had previously visited British and Italian authorities in the same capacity in May to explore the two countries' attitudes towards reconvening the Disarmament Conference. The main point of his talks with Foreign Minister Barthou was also disarmament. It is thought that Ribbentrop must have personally informed Barthou of Germany's current situation regarding its military demands, and that the French Foreign Minister must have strongly advised Hitler's envoy to return to the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, and assured him that the Disarmament Conference would consider Germany's demands with a very fair attitude, because Germany's demands have a great relationship with the construction of peace in Europe. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Security Committee of the Disarmament Conference is scheduled to hold its first meeting next Monday. (On the 11th of this month, the General Committee, in accordance with the compromise proposal put forward by Barthou, organized four committees: (1) Security, (2) Supervision and Guarantee of the Implementation of the Convention, (3) Aviation, and (4) Manufacturing and Sale of Armaments. The Security Committee is chaired by Greek representative Politis.) (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>German Ambassador to Russia Resigns Due to Differences of Opinion with the Diplomatic Authorities</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Ambassador to Moscow Nadolny has resigned. According to speculation by diplomatic circles here, Nadolny's resignation is due to differences of opinion with the German Foreign Ministry on various issues, especially on the issue of the Baltic countries negotiating a convention. Nadolny had served as the German representative to the Disarmament Conference and is the most prestigious figure in the current German diplomatic circles. He has considerable influence in German political circles. His resignation is seen as quite consequential. Rumors are spreading that German Ambassador to Washington Luther will also be leaving his post soon, but it is difficult to prove whether this is credible. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Minor Entente Permanent Council Meeting to Convene; Focus on Economic Relations with Russia</h3>
<p>Rome - The Permanent Political Council of the three Minor Entente nations is scheduled to convene here tomorrow. This marks the first meeting of the three foreign ministers this year, and given the current international situation, its significance is particularly pronounced. Among the three nations, Czechoslovakia and Romania recently recognized the Soviet Union. Consequently, the three foreign ministers will specifically discuss the political and economic relations between the Minor Entente nations and Soviet Russia during the meeting. The Yugoslavian Foreign Minister recently met with Litvinov in Geneva, and upon arrival, he is expected to report the date and manner of Yugoslavia's recognition of Soviet Russia to the Czech and Romanian foreign ministers. If Yugoslavia confirms its recognition, the Permanent Political Council will draft a joint declaration to be signed by the three foreign ministers as a formal expression of the three nations' joint recognition of Soviet Russia. Furthermore, the Permanent Political Council will follow past precedents by studying various issues related to economic construction in Central Europe, based on cooperation among the Danube countries.

<h3>Persian King Arrives in Ankara; Receives Grand Welcome; Heads of State Shake Hands in Cordial Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Ankara - The King of Persia arrived in the Turkish capital yesterday. From early morning, crowds had gathered along the main roads around the station, eager to catch a glimpse of the King. Cavalry patrolled the station, closely guarding the area. Troops were stationed along the route of the motorcade, forming a tight barrier. Persian flags were prominently displayed on buildings throughout the city. Prime Minister İsmet Pasha, the entire cabinet, the Speaker of the National Assembly, all military officers (from generals upwards), and senior officials were present to welcome the King. President Kemal Pasha arrived five minutes before the Persian King's special train. When the Persian King arrived at the station at 2:30 PM, the two heads of state embraced to express their closeness. The military presented arms as a salute, and the band played the national anthem. The crowd cheered enthusiastically, and artillery fired a 21-gun salute to welcome the guest. After the military review, the two heads of state rode in the President's carriage to a specially prepared guest house. A squadron of riflemen closely followed the carriage for protection. President Kemal sent the Persian King to the guesthouse and departed after settling in, returning to the Presidential Palace. Subsequently, the Persian King drove to visit the President in return. That evening, President Kemal hosted a grand banquet at the Presidential Palace to entertain the Persian King. During the banquet, the President gave a speech, wishing for the enduring friendship between Turkey and Persia, and saying that the Persian King's visit to Turkey was a memorable event for both countries' relations and world peace.

<p>(Tokyo) - Foreign Minister Hirota has instructed Ambassador Matsudaira on the policy regarding the London disarmament preparatory meeting. However, as it is necessary to adapt to the progress of the meeting, he is coordinating with the navy to discuss countermeasures at any time, and has prepared everything accordingly. The special dispatch of influential figures such as Mr. Davis and Lieutenant General Yardeley by the United States indicates that the U.S. intends to use this opportunity to engage in substantive preparatory negotiations regarding next year's disarmament conference. This is therefore highly significant. However, Japan is currently adopting a passive attitude towards the preparatory meeting, and depending on the situation, may put forward positive proposals for substantive disarmament, determined to break the situation since the Washington Conference. If Britain and the United States maintain their previous attitude and do not accommodate Japan's positive proposals, it is difficult to guarantee that Britain and the United States will not reach some understanding to restrain Japan before Japan presents its proposals. Therefore, the Japanese authorities are paying close attention to the measures taken by Britain and the United States in this regard. (Dentsu dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - Preparatory negotiations for the disarmament conference are scheduled to begin this week, with the arrival of U.S. representative Davis in London on the 16th. Ambassador Matsudaira and Foreign Minister Simon's meeting is scheduled for around the 25th. Japan's policy will be telegraphed to Ambassador Matsudaira by Foreign Minister Hirota after obtaining cabinet approval. The navy will instruct Naval Attaché Colonel Oka Shin to be stationed in Britain, and in order to assist Colonel Oka, will send Lieutenant Commander Tateyama Sumisada Jiro, who is assigned to the post of naval attaché in Britain, with instructions. Naval Minister Osumi held a head office meeting at the Naval Minister's official residence on the 8th and decided on the outline of Japan's disarmament policy, which will also be conveyed to Ambassador Matsudaira and Colonel Oka by Lieutenant Commander Yamasumi. The outline is as follows: (1) Demand that all countries reduce total tonnage and reduce the number of ships. (2) Abolish the ratio system and establish a total tonnage system. (3) Ensure national defense autonomy. (4) Establish the principle of military equality. (Dentsu, 17th)</p>
<p>Dentsu)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) - Preparatory negotiations for the disarmament conference will determine the venue and timing of next year's disarmament conference. The Japanese naval authorities have the following intentions: (1) The Japanese authorities have always opposed holding the disarmament conference in Washington or London, and consider The Hague or Brazil, a third country, to be appropriate. If communication is inconvenient, Paris would also be acceptable. (2) Due to preparation reasons, the British proposal of January next year is very inconvenient, and they advocate April next year.

<h3>Germany Suspends Debt Payments; France Seeks Amicable Solution; Not Adopting Unilateral Measures</h3>
<p>(Paris) - The French cabinet was originally scheduled to decide on a resolution to deal with Germany's suspension of debt payments today, but it has now been postponed to next week. )Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) - Regarding Germany's suspension of foreign debt interest payments for six months, the government is now considering two solutions: (1) Establishing an offsetting agency. (2) Levying a special tax on imported German goods to pay the principal and interest on the Dawes and Young Loans. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain has also mentioned the adoption of offsetting measures. Once this is implemented, France will inevitably take the same measures. However, the government believes that an agreement between France and Germany is not impossible, so it prefers to negotiate an amicable solution rather than take unilateral measures of an unpleasant nature. The government will definitely make a decision at the next meeting of the Council of State, but general opinion now seems to favor the second method. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Britain Advocates Establishing Clearing House; Internal Opinions Divided</h3>
<p>(London) - British attitudes towards the statement made by Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain in the House of Commons are inconsistent. Even when the Chancellor of the Exchequer answered questions in Parliament, he stated that the establishment of a British-German debt clearing house would be limited to the United Kingdom itself and would not extend to all dependencies. Opposition in London is very strong for three reasons: (1) The clearing house will further complicate the procedures for the exchange of goods between the two countries and make it more difficult for the economy to return to normal. (2) Germany's ability to import raw materials will be further restricted, which will also delay its economic recovery. (3) The clearing plan requires Britain to purchase more German goods in order to succeed, that is, Germany must reduce imports from Britain and increase exports. Most of Germany's exports are now manufactured goods, so the result will be that British industry will suffer to benefit bondholders, which is not a good idea. (Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>US Not Considering Retaliation Until Last Resort</h3>
<p>(Washington) - The State Department will issue a statement on Germany's suspension of foreign debt interest payments, explaining its attitude. Secretary of State Hull declared that the United States will firmly oppose any discriminatory attitude that harms the interests of Americans, but the United States will not take retaliatory measures until the last resort. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) - After the German central bank announced the suspension of foreign debt interest payments, Senator Harrison, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, proposed a draft resolution advocating that if debts and interest owed to Americans are not fully repaid, then the United States should also suspend the payment of funds to Germany in the name of the (Mixed Debt Commission). Today, the Senate passed an amendment to the bill, which was transferred to the House of Representatives. The bill stipulates that unless Germany resumes repaying its debts to Americans, the private property of German expatriates seized by the United States during the European War, which should now be returned, cannot be repaid. This item is paid from a fund of 20 million yuan. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Goods Encounter Obstacles Everywhere; Norway and British Territories Restrict Imports; Dutch East Indies to Adopt Bata System</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) - The Norwegian government intends to implement preventive tariffs or even import tariffs on Japanese goods such as rubber shoes and light bulbs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed Ambassador Shiratori stationed in Norway yesterday to convey a strong opinion, that if the Norwegian government adopts this illegal act, the Japanese government will have no choice but to adopt retaliatory policies. (Dentsu News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - According to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the British government of Malta is implementing an import ratio system. As a result, Japanese cotton cloth is limited to 50,000 yards, and Italian cotton cloth is limited to 800,000 yards. Japanese goods are severely hit, and Japan will lodge a serious protest with the Maltese government. (Dentsu News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - Governor-General Yangke of the Dutch East Indies expressed his intention to adopt the Bata system in a speech in the Upper House on the 14th. If the Dutch East Indies officially proposes this to Japan, Japan will reject it for the following two reasons. On the 16th, Representative Nagaoka was strictly instructed, namely (1) Although the Bata system is intended to restrict the import of Japanese goods, it is still difficult to import expensive European and American goods. As a result, it hinders trade in the Dutch East Indies and cannot realize Governor Yangke's advocacy of coexistence and co-prosperity. (2) Restricting the import of Japanese goods for the benefit of Britain and thirteen other countries violates the most-favored-nation clause of the Japanese-Dutch trade treaty.

<h3>Tear Gas Thrown in Vienna Theater; National Socialist Party Terrorist Acts Emerge Repeatedly</h3>
<p>Vienna - At 8 o'clock last night, the National Theater was performing a famous opera by the great composer Mr. Xu, sung by the famous actor Tao Bei. As the orchestra was about to begin playing, someone, whose name is unknown, released tear gas. The audience was in tears. The theater authorities immediately ordered the windows to be opened to circulate the air, and then continued the performance. Fortunately, the order was not disturbed. It is generally believed that this must have been done by members of the National Socialist Party. The party's terrorist acts are emerging repeatedly. A bomb was placed on the tracks of a suburban railway, but fortunately it was discovered in time and did not explode. A bomb was found in front of the residence of a former member of parliament in Bidal City, Carinthia Province, but it did not explode either. A bomb exploded in the Higher School of Agriculture here last night, destroying two classrooms and causing heavy damage. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>United States Decides to Join International Labour Organization</h3>
<p>(Washington) - Despite opposition from the Republican Party, Congress passed a resolution deciding that the United States join the International Labour Organization (i.e. the International Labour Conference and International Labour Bureau in Geneva). However, the resolution states that this decision does not impose any obligations on the United States to the League of Nations. Senator Tinkham, the Republican senator who opposed the resolution most strongly, said, (The United States' joining the International Labour Organization will bring it closer to the League of Nations, which is different from joining the International Court of Justice.) Secretary of Labor Perkins strongly supported the resolution, mainly arguing that since the United States is striving to improve the status of labor, joining the International Labour Organization is a matter of course.

<h3>San Francisco Dock Strike Resolved; Employers Recognize Union</h3>
<p>San Francisco - The longshoremen's strike, which began five weeks ago, has reportedly been resolved today. The whole country is relieved to hear the news. After the Mayor of San Francisco sent a private telegram requesting President Roosevelt's intervention, he announced that the dock strike had now been resolved. National Longshoremen's Association President Ryan stated that employers have recognized the union, and the dispute between the two parties regarding the labor management agency has been agreed to be ended. Workers are expected to approve this settlement agreement. This strike occurred on May 9, when employers refused to meet the longshoremen's demands for increased wages and reduced working hours, which greatly affected scheduled ship departures. Employers attempted to hire non-union workers in order to break the strike, but this led to clashes between police and longshoremen, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries. Finally, a peace conference was convened to reconcile the differences between the two parties, and this result was achieved today. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Actively Handling Outstanding Cases; US Congress to Adjourn; General Election Scheduled for November</h3>
<p>(Washington) - After fourteen and a half hours of fierce debate, the Senate reconvened at 1:30 PM today and will meet again on Monday morning. The original plan to adjourn today has not been possible. There are many obstacles in the meeting, so it is impossible to conclude things.

<h3>Jiangxi-Guangdong and Jiangxi-Hunan Roads to be Fully Open to Traffic at the End of the Month; Nanchang to Guangzhou Reachable in Three Days; Nanchang to Changsha Reachable Overnight</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi Province's transportation southward to Baiyue (Guangdong and Guangxi) and westward to Xiaoxiang (Hunan) is extremely inconvenient. To travel from Nanchang to Guangzhou, one must detour through Shanghai, travel south by sea, a journey of ten days. If traveling via Ganzhou and over Qingling, it takes even longer. To travel from Nanchang to Hunan, one must detour through Hanzhong and Gaoxiao, crossing Dongting Lake, requiring five to six days. Traveling via Pingxiang is even less frequented. As a result, the economy and culture are both affected. Since the Highway Bureau planned to open the Jiangxi-Guangdong and Jiangxi-Hunan roads, construction has been underway in sections. The sections from Nanchang to Wanzai, Ganzhou to Guangzhou, and Nanchang to Suichuan have already been opened to traffic one after another. It is now heard that the Wanzai to Liuyang section of the Jiangxi-Hunan road and the Suichuan to Ganzhou section of the Jiangxi-Guangdong road will be completed simultaneously at the end of this month, with the entire line open to traffic. At that time, Nanchang to Liuyang will connect with Hunan Province, allowing direct access to Changsha. Nanchang to Ganzhou via Dayu will allow direct access to Guangzhou. Calculating the mileage, Nanchang to Changsha can be reached overnight, and Nanchang to Guangzhou will take at most three days, which is much more convenient than detouring through other provinces as in the past.

<h3>On the Eve of a Far East War: Japanese Army Actively Undertaking Military Installations in Manchuria; Soviet Russia Pays Close Attention to the Completion of the Japanese Puppet Bin-Hei Line; Three Major Barracks Built in Heilongjiang Province to Accommodate 50,000 Japanese Troops; Military Industries for Wartime Defense Moved into Tunnels</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: According to people coming from the Northeast, the Japanese and their puppet regime are actively preparing for war in the Northeast, seemingly believing that a major war is about to begin. In particular, their various military constructions have attracted special attention from Soviet Russia. The following is a record of what was discussed:</p>
<p>According to reports, the Japanese military plan in the Northeast, the Manzhouli direction on the Harbin-Manzhouli line, the Japanese army has only 150 cavalry because when the war breaks out, the Japanese plan to defend Hailar and abandon Manzhouli. The Japanese have completely blockaded Manzhouli, cut off traffic with Soviet Russia, so the Russians often use aircraft hovering over Manzhouli Xing'anling places, threatening the Japanese army, Another Japanese Brigade, led by Kosaka, is stationed at a fortress near Manzhouli. The second line of defense for Harbin-Manzhouli is Hailar (pseudo Xing'an North Province), with a Japanese brigade and an aircraft factory. In Heilongjiang, the Japanese have built three major barracks, the North Barracks, East Barracks and South Barracks, as well as aircraft factories. The area of the three major barracks is 30 square li, accommodating around 50,000 Japanese troops. Beianzhen in northern Heilongjiang has become a military stronghold, connected to the Hu-Hai line in the south. The northern end of this line is connected to the La-Bin line (Jidong Lafa station to Harbin). This road connects to the (Beijing)-Tumen River road (Changchun to Tumen River) in the south, and connects to the Chongjin port in Korea in the east, which is a military port. It's calculated to take 30% less time to transport troops from Chongjin port to Harbin than from Andong. This road is being built north from Beianzhen, aiming to cross Xing'anling and reach Heihe. If this road is completed, it will be more important militarily and a major threat to the Siberian Railway. Therefore, the Russians are very afraid of the success of this road, and the Japanese army also identified this road as the lifeline for the invasion of the Far East. The Japanese army can use this lifeline to cut off the Soviet border's Siberian Railway and isolate the heavy army in Vladivostok, the Japanese army's dangerous scheme is really vicious. There are 500 Japanese garrison troops in places like Da Heihe (Great Heihe) and Aigun. The second line of defense is the Lesser Xing'anling, formerly the old Russian defensive line of our country. In short, the Japanese trend of preparing for war against Soviet Russia is to defend the Greater Xing'anling on the northwest route and the Lesser Xing'anling on the northeast route. The lower reaches of the Songhua River, Tongjiang, is difficult to defend. The second line of defense seems to be in Yilan, because there is the danger of the Mudanjiang River to the south of Yilan. The first line of the Harbin-Suifenhe Line is Mishan Suifenhe Dongning, etc., although it is a military strategic area, there is no danger to defend. More than 100,000 Japanese troops are stationed on this line. The second line of defense should be the Ai River, because there is the danger of the Mudanjiang River to defend. There is a solid artillery fortress built here, and the tunnel leads directly to the Ai River City, so the Ai River is also a Japanese military town. The Japanese army has made great efforts in air defense. To prevent air strikes, they have done their best to move important military industries into tunnels. Japanese citizens and students are also undergoing strict military training, and women are working hard to cultivate rice fields. However, most of the domestic intellectuals are dissatisfied with the actions of the Japanese army, because it is impossible to predict whether the invasion of Manchuria will bring disaster or blessing.

<h3>Jiang Bocheng Arrives in Guangdong to Confer with Chen Jitang on Bandit Suppression Plans; Southeast Military Liaison Largely Determined</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Jiang Bocheng, a member of the Military Committee of Peiping [Beijing], was ordered to go south this time. He first went to Fujian and discussed various major plans with Jiang Dingwen, the commander of the Eastern Route Army Bandit Suppression. He then left Fujian and arrived in Guangdong on the 7th. The Guangdong authorities sent representatives to welcome Jiang to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee for a welcoming banquet. Jiang and his two followers attended, with attendees including Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Deng Zeru, Zou Lu, Lin Yunhai, Liu Jiwen, Qu Fangpu, Lin Yizhong, and others. During the banquet, Jiang reported on his mission to Guangdong and the political situation in North China. Zou Lu, on behalf of the Southwest authorities, reported on the Southwest's attitude toward the current situation and its military and political conditions. After the reports were completed, they had a very pleasant conversation. Jiang also exchanged bandit suppression opinions with Chen and Li and discussed the issue of national defense in South China. They did not conclude the discussions and banquet until 5:00 PM. That afternoon at 7:00 PM, Chen Jitang, in his capacity as host, hosted a dinner party at his private residence in Meihua Village to welcome Jiang and invited various generals to accompany them. The party did not disperse until around 8:00 PM. Chen Jitang deemed that Jiang's mission to Guangdong this time, to negotiate on military and bandit suppression matters, required detailed consultations with various military commanders. Therefore, at 9:00 AM on the 9th, he convened a meeting of the province's military commanders of the army, navy, and air force at the headquarters to discuss everything. Attendees included Li Yangjing, commander of the Second Column of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army; Li Jieqi, commander of the Humen Fortress; Jiang Xiyuan, commander of the fleet; Zhang Zhiying, commander of the navy; Lin Fuyuan, chief of staff of the air force headquarters; Miao Peinan, chief of staff of the headquarters; Fan Dexing, pacification commissioner for the central district; Chen Zhangfu, pacification commissioner for the southern district; and various directors of the headquarters. Chen Jitang presided over the meeting and announced Jiang Bocheng's arrival to discuss plans for sending troops to suppress the bandits, so that the Southeast armies could launch a joint large-scale operation at the same time. The meeting then discussed the province's pacification plan, concluding at 11:00 AM. It is reported that the result of Chen and Jiang's consultations over the past few days is that they have concrete plans for military action and bandit suppression in the Southwest. Once they discuss the situation with Yu Hanmou, commander of the First Column (Yu returned to the province from Da Shuo on the afternoon of the 10th in response to a call), the matter can be resolved satisfactorily. The Southwest military actions are not yet at a stage to be announced. The bandit suppression progress has been largely determined to be implemented according to Chairman Jiang's bandit suppression plan, and a liaison method for the two Southeast bandit suppression armies has been agreed upon. Each side will dispatch a senior military officer to be stationed in Fujian and Guangdong to serve as the military liaison for the two armies. Information on the progress of the troops and the reality of the bandits on the front lines will be mutually reported to facilitate military operations. It is reported that Jiang Bocheng will leave Guangdong after consulting with Yu Hanmou and Chen Jitang again, first returning to Fujian to report on the liaison bandit suppression plan, and then turning to Nanchang to report back.

<h3>Zhu Tingfen: Suicide Note Discovered After Death, Instructing That His Writings (Ling Shu Lun) Be Published to Compete with Foreigners for Academic Honor</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The case of Henan's Zhu Tingfen (previously mistaken as the surname Zhu) suicide has caused quite a sigh of emotion among members of the society. Zhu's body has now been collected by a fellow villager, and a mourning ceremony will be held when his children arrive in Jinan. When collecting the body, a suicide note was found beside Zhu. It stated that he was unable to benefit the country and the people on a large scale, nor could he support his parents and raise his children on a small scale, and he was unable to protect himself and return to his hometown, so he decided to die. The will deals with family affairs in great detail, which shows that he had been preparing for suicide for some time. He also instructed that his book, "Ling Shu Lun" (Numbers and Remainder Theory), be printed and passed down to posterity. It is said that Zhu was proficient in mathematics. He was unable to be in a prominent position during his lifetime, but after his death, he still had to compete with others for academic honors. His arrogance and depression are revealed in the writing. The book was written on two sheets of eight-row stationery and placed in an ordinary envelope with the words "Suicide Note" written on the cover. The book is divided into six articles, which are transcribed below: (1) Fen is old and sick, and is in a foreign country. He cannot benefit the people on a large scale, nor can he support his parents and raise his children on a small scale, nor can he protect himself and return to his hometown. What is the use of this useless body? Therefore, he decided to die. My poor wife and children! My poor wife and children! (2) After death, please ask the person in charge to cremate his body. (3) Wang Shuofu's grandmother has three old contracts from my family: (1) A contract for selling to the Zhou family by the Zhang family (2) A contract for selling to Zhu Yinxi Tangren Ji by the Zhou family (3) Two old red deeds from Zhu Yinxi Ren Ji. Please send them back to the family through Zhang Jingzhi in Kaifeng. (4) My "Ling Shu Lun" is to supplement the lack of calculus. Please ask the government to earnestly promote it, so as to compete with foreigners for academic honors. This is what Fen cannot forget after his death ("Ling Shu Lun" is in the willow box) (5) Fen's suicide is from his own heart and has nothing to do with his relatives and friends, or with the innkeeper. He will repay any debts to relatives and friends in future generations. The innkeeper's rent has been paid in full. (6) There are 30 silver dollars in the leather suitcase, which were borrowed from Director Zhang for the use of his family. Due to time constraints, they have not been sent back yet. There is another paper for his brother-in-law, Wang Shuofu, the original text is: Shuofu's sister Qian, Fen kept three old contracts in the hands of his sister, and asked him to send them to Zhang Jingzhi (No. 4, Jiamao Hutong) in Kaifeng to be transferred to his home. Please ask the police to take care of and entrust them to Shao Shen. In addition, regarding Zhu Tingfen's brief history, there were slight errors in the previous draft due to time constraints. Zhu graduated from the Forestry Department of Beijing Jing Normal University during the Qing Dynasty. He successively served as the principal of Beijing Higher School of Administration, the first section chief of the Henan Industry Department, and once acted as the director of the department, the principal of the Henan Agricultural College, the professor of Henan University, and the editor of the Henan Gazetteer. Because he was honest and upright, and had no savings, he eventually died in depression. It is heard that Director Zhang Honglie was planning to get him the position of Salt Affairs Supervisor of Qingdao, and also a consultant for the Salt Affairs Audit Office. He had learned of this before his death, but the appointment had not been issued yet. He had repeatedly told his friends that he was old and sick and feared that he would not be able to do his job well, and would let down Director Zhang's recommendation, and was deeply worried about it. Those who heard it kindly comforted and persuaded him, but little did they know that the success of the plan was hastening his death. (15th)</p>

<h3>Grand Dragon Boat Racing Spectacle</h3>
<p>In this county, every year during the old lunar Dragon Boat Festival, there is a tradition of dragon boat racing. This year is even more so. The other day, from the Ximen Suspension Bridge to the area around Behtang Wu Bridge Huang Bu Mound, there were hairpins and shadows of temples, and the crowds chanted together. The most spectacular dragon boats were from Gangjian, Shangfu Temple, Dingfengli, Behtang, and other places. The entire boat was decorated with five-colored building towers up to two stories high, with flags and umbrellas of various colors flying high, fluttering in the wind, which was quite beautiful. The boats were distinguished as green dragon, yellow dragon, and white dragon, and each rower showed off their skills and competed on the water. There were also night colors in the evening. Yesterday (the 17th), dragon boats from Jiangjianshang and Sanliqiao went to Guitouzhu in Taihu Lake to race.

The other day, it was the Dragon Boat Festival. After school in the afternoon, Shiliang gathered seven classmates to swim and play in the city river next to the school. Unexpectedly, Shiliang went underwater while swimming and did not come out for a long time. The other classmates realized that something was wrong and went ashore one after another. At that time, a certain Jia from Jiangbei, who was watching from the side, bravely jumped into the water and fished Shiliang out. However, his face was covered in mud and he had no breath. He was immediately carried to the school, and school doctor Xu Songquan was immediately asked for emergency treatment, but it was ultimately ineffective. The school then notified his mother, Zhang, to come to the school to prepare a coffin and collect the body. Zhang caressed the body and cried bitterly, which was unbearable to hear.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: County Government Executes Four Bandits</h3>

<h3>Yangzhou: Yan Huiqing Visits Yangzhou</h3>

<h3>Over a Hundred Refugees Loot Lingfeng Temple</h3>
<p>Lingfeng Temple in Zhenhai County is said to be the place where Ge Hong of the Jin Dynasty became enlightened. It has always had a thriving incense and the income from votive offerings is considerable. At around 10:00 a.m. the other day, more than 180 refugees from Hubei suddenly broke into the temple, demanding travel expenses. The abbot of the temple, Shi Zhang, gave them five yuan in silver. The refugees were dissatisfied with what they wanted and surrounded the temple, driving out the monks and looting at will. Twenty-five thousand copper coins, ten yuan in silver, and one hundred jiao in silver corners were looted.

After the discussions, Wang Xiaolai delivered the closing address, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Opening Speech</h3>
<p>The presidium publicly elected Wang Xiaolai to deliver the opening speech, saying that the association holds a general meeting once a year according to its charter. This year happens to be the fifth membership congress. Xiaolai and others have been entrusted by the members to handle the association's affairs for four consecutive years, and their term has expired according to the charter. Looking back on the past four years, it can be described as experiencing great difficulties and mixed feelings. There is little to speak of in terms of achievements. In simple terms, the Chamber of Commerce is formed by a collection of merchants. The responsibility of the merchants, in other words, is also the responsibility of the Chamber of Commerce. What is the responsibility of the merchants? This can be found in Sima Qian's "Biographies of Money-Makers," which says, "Agriculture produces, industry completes, and commerce circulates." This means that the responsibility of merchants is to be the intermediary between agriculture and industry, not the intermediary for foreigners. Therefore, it is the natural duty of merchants to promote domestic goods, and it is the natural duty of the Chamber of Commerce to lead merchants in promoting domestic goods. This is a simple and clear principle that we cannot shirk or evade. In recent years, imports have greatly exceeded exports, becoming more serious year by year, reaching nearly 600 million yuan each year. Some have said that our country's cash reserves are only 300 million yuan. If we continue on this path for five more years, the cash will be completely depleted. What a shocking thing this is! Our country's foreign trade has always been a history of failure, and the degree of failure in recent years is even more rapid than before. The failure of merchants, fundamentally speaking, is due to the Chamber of Commerce itself failing to fulfill its duties. From another perspective, although it can be attributed to difficult circumstances and various reasons for failure, some difficulties are now being adequately resolved. While it is true that various countries have increased tariff barriers due to commercial depression, which has greatly impacted the export of domestic goods and reduced the volume of trade, Japanese goods are facing even greater obstacles and are being resented everywhere. How can they still walk freely through the thorns? Although they are being squeezed by increased taxes or import quotas everywhere, they can still maintain their sales or even make some progress. Moreover, when Chinese merchants encounter foreign tax increases, they have no other option but to request the government to negotiate, while they can always find ways to deal with such problems themselves. For example, when India abolished the Japan-India Commercial Treaty, they immediately stopped purchasing Indian cotton as retaliation, which eventually led to the Japan-India Conference. An ancient Chinese saying goes, "Do not blame others," and another says, "Reflect on yourself." Xiaolai and others often compare these events and feel that since our country has had a Chamber of Commerce for 30 years, its effectiveness in assisting the country and revitalizing trade has not been significant. Even regarding the responsibility of leading merchants, we are ashamed that we have not been able to fulfill even a fraction of it. Having served for four years, time has been wasted, and we cannot but express our guilt today when members are present. Since the Chamber of Commerce is organized by a collection of merchants, the shortcomings of the Chamber of Commerce can also be said to be the shortcomings of the merchants. If we want to reflect on ourselves and make up for lost time, we must also conduct an investigation into the shortcomings of the merchants. Based on Xiaolai's years of experience, they are generally inclined to be passive and neglect the active aspects. For example, the reduction of taxes and freight rates should be emphasized by merchants, but after the government agrees to reduce them, how to improve the organization, how to expand sales channels, and how to improve quality are often put on the back burner. Therefore, there are often cases where taxes are reduced, but trade remains sluggish. Secondly, they like to follow and imitate, and lack the spirit of observing the overall situation and pioneering hard work. For example, recently, the country's cash has been concentrated in Shanghai, and the financial sector is struggling to find investment opportunities. However, no one invests in organizing the most needed sugar refineries and rayon factories, while the establishment of banks is like bamboo shoots after rain, emerging endlessly. It can be seen that the current situation of Chinese merchants is still far from the so-called planned economy and statistical economy. The future duties of the association are to correct its shortcomings over the years on the one hand, and to lead merchants to improve their shortcomings on the other. We feel the failures of the past and have to place our hopes on the future. Although Xiaolai and others are about to complete their terms, they should still do their best to assist the members. Therefore, on the occasion of this grand gathering, in the midst of self-blame, we still express our sincere suggestions, hoping for public judgment.</p>
<h3>Review Report</h3>

<h3>Telegram Passed</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing Military Council, Since your command stationed in Jiangxi, your instructions have been wise and your rewards and punishments have been clear. The officers and soldiers have obeyed orders and the people have been harmonious, so that the bandit areas have gradually been eliminated. The people of the three provinces have the hope of emerging from fire and water and ascending to the seat. This is a critical moment for the country's recovery and the rise and fall of the nation. We admire your grand plan and express our gratitude. In the past, after Zuo Wenxiang cleared the Western Nian and pacified Guanlong, he devoted all his efforts to recovering Ili. By using both strategy and power, the Russians admired his demeanor, and finally the lost golden cup returned to the map. Even today, the western border still benefits from it. The demeanor of the sages of the past is not far from today. With the public's strength, we hope that you will follow the sages and will not bear to see the Han descendants of the four provinces forever lament their foreign rule. Therefore, on behalf of the public opinion of all merchants and people in Shanghai, we express our expectations, hoping that you will soon play the continuation of sweeping away the bandits and capturing the leaders. Once the drinking ceremony is completed, you will immediately turn your chariot to the east and complete the great feat of pacifying the country and quelling foreign troubles, so that the distant Yanjiang will not become a foreign land. Your contribution to the country is boundless. We respectfully express our sincere feelings and humbly request your adoption. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Fifth Congress of Members and Representatives, 篠,</p>

What remains is an implementation problem. With the acumen and ability of the newly elected members and the familiarity of the members who have not yet completed their terms, working together with one heart and mind, they will surely be able to improve the association's affairs day by day and plan for the future. This is truly a cause for celebration. As the ancients said, the policies of the former magistrate must be reported to the new magistrate. Xiaolai and others have reviewed the past four years of their service, and today, to seek the revival of commerce, piecemeal measures will not suffice. For example, in recent years, the association has been trying to implement commercial statistics on the one hand, and expanding the domestic goods market on the other, thinking of catching up from an active perspective. However, the things that can be done are not even one ten-thousandth of what should be done, resulting in exhaustion and ineffectiveness. The decline of domestic goods exports has reached its extreme, and the surge in import surplus has broken the record since the opening of trade. What is emerging is nothing but a painful and deplorable situation. Therefore, today, without drastic measures, supplemented by meticulous designs, it will be difficult to reverse this unprecedented decline. However, this matter is limited by human resources and material resources. It is impossible not to follow the path and move forward step by step. However, the global economic situation has reached a point of close combat, and it is impossible for us to move slowly. Therefore, today's situation requires not only the members of the association to be fully mobilized, but also all merchants in the city to assist the association in its full mobilization, in order to cope with this extraordinary situation. This is the painful experience of Xiaolai and others over the years. I dare to offer this meaning for your consideration.</p>

<h3>Northwest Problem Research Association, Welcome Reception the Night Before Last, Zhu Shaoliang and Others Talked About the West</h3>
<p>The Northwest Problem Research Association held a welcome reception for the association's sponsoring members Banchan, Zhu Shaoliang, Li Shizeng, Wu Tiecheng, and the Lanzhou branch members Zhu Jingzhou, Zhang Wei, Wei Fuzi, and Li Zhaoyao at the YMCA on the ninth floor at 7 pm the day before yesterday.

More than 20 members of the association, including Pan Gongzhan, Lin Kanghou, Yin Zhufu, Guo Weiping, Ying Chengyi, Jiang Jianbai, Pan Yangyao, and Zhao Wenhuan, attended. Lin Kanghou presided over the meeting and delivered a welcome speech, stating that after the fall of the Northeast, the Northwest is in danger. The association was established after the January 28th Incident and sent representatives to the Northwest for investigation, striving to research and promote, hoping to provide a reference for the authorities and attract the attention of the people. You are either veterans of the Party and the country, or leaders of the military and political affairs in the Northwest, and are responsible for building the Northwest and consolidating the border defense. In theory and practice, there is a need for mutual cooperation. I hope that you will provide us with the most needed problems and materials in the Northwest for research, so that we can help the government solve the Northwest problem and increase the welfare of the people. Then Zhu Shaoliang gave a reply, saying that he was honored to be welcomed by everyone today. Personally, I feel that although there are many problems in the Northwest, the most important thing is relief. We can only talk about development after we have provided relief to the Northwest. When it comes to development, whether it is agriculture, farmland, water conservancy, transportation, mining, or culture, it is necessary to have detailed research and planning first. I hope that experts in industry and finance will go to the Northwest to see more, and use the economy of Shanghai to support the production of the Northwest and provide relief to the rural areas of the Northwest. The Northwest Problem Research Association has worked very hard in the past, and I believe that it will definitely make great contributions to the Northwest in the future. Then Li Shizeng raised the issue of Northwest products, Zhu Yingpeng raised the issue of water conservancy, Wang Renlin raised the issue of economy, Guo Weiping raised the issue of county administration improvement and Yumen oil, and Li Dachao and Yin Zhu raised the issue of building light railways. Zhu answered them one by one and discussed with each other. It was not until about 10 o'clock that they took a photo and dispersed. It was also reported that after the association dispersed, it held a meeting of directors. All directors attended the meeting. The chairman reviewed the social members and passed the application of Fang Yexian, Cai Shengbai, Xie Shenru, Xi Guansheng, Shao Xiugu, Fang Jiange, Zhang Nanyuan, and more than 20 others, and will issue membership cards soon.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Chen Su reported on the preparations, stating that since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement in Nanchang, the whole country responded to the call and worked hard to promote it. This movement takes propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame as its center, and expresses a new spirit from the daily life of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. This spirit is the spirit of national rejuvenation, in other words, it is the basic work of saving the nation and preserving its existence. Seamen across the country have already started to promote the New Life Movement, and in the past month, they have appointed responsible persons to start preparations. However, seamen have mobile jobs, so it was decided to take the method of solicitation and appoint team leaders to solicit separately. Now the number of members has reached more than 10,000, so the inaugural meeting is held today. I hope to elect directors and supervisors to intensify their efforts so that the New Life Movement will be universally realized and jointly shoulder the responsibility of rejuvenating the nation.</p>

<p>After the meeting, more than a thousand seamen gathered in front of the Guandi Temple on Zhaojiabang Road. Under the leadership of the general commander Wang Chengsheng and the chief inspector Chen Su, the team was arranged and set off at 2:10. The Public Security Bureau sent eleven or two squads of police to lead the way, and various seamen's organizations held various flags and advanced in formation.

The spectators along the way were quite crowded.</p>
<h3>Nanhua Industry Dismisses Large Number of Employees, Labor Union Holds Emergency Meeting to Discuss Response</h3>
<p>Dagon Society said that the total number of Nanhua stores in the city is about 420. They have always used the abolition of the lunar calendar festival as the dismissal period. In 1920, the labor union requested the Social Bureau to mediate and sign a contract stipulating that February 28th of each year is the date for the entry and exit of employees in each store, and no dismissal may be made at will outside of this date. However, each store still sticks to the old habits and still dismisses employees, resulting in disputes every festival. This year's abolished lunar Dragon Boat Festival, more than 60 Nanhua stores, including Yusheng on Beijing Road, Hengsheng on Yan'an Road, and Wannianfu on Tangjiawan, announced the dismissal of 120 employees, including Yang Qinsheng, Chen Guobin, Li Yongtang, Sun Boquan, Xu Yongao, and Chen Xuanqing. Each worker was suddenly dismissed, and their livelihoods were worrying. The masses were panicked and reported to the Nanhua Labor Union, requesting them to send personnel to negotiate so as to avoid unemployment. After the Nanhua Industry Labor Union received reports from the dismissed workers, it considered the matter important and should seek appropriate solutions. A temporary emergency meeting was held at the union headquarters at 1 pm yesterday. More than 10 people, including Zhu Bofeng and Qin Haixiong, attended. The meeting was chaired by Yu Yaoqiu. After each worker reported the unreasonable dismissal by the capitalists, the following solutions were immediately decided: (1) According to the labor-capital contract, send personnel to contact the trade association and request them to jointly send personnel to negotiate with each store. (2) Submit a request to the Party and government agencies and the General Labor Union for assistance. (3) Please establish an unemployment referral agency immediately to find a way to settle them. (4) Immediately start preparing for the establishment of a biscuit factory by raising funds and recruit unemployed workers in batches. (5) Schedule a meeting of the members of the Tongren Lianyishe to discuss assistance measures. The meeting was adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Wang Yitang's Itinerary</h3>
<p>Dongxun News: Mr. Wang Yitang left Tokyo on the 29th of last month and went to Osaka.

It is said that the temple was built by the Tang Dynasty monk Jianzhen from Yangzhou, who traveled to Japan after many years of hardships, built the temple himself, and promoted Buddhism. His achievements were great. The relics and objects are still well preserved. Mr. Wang also told people that Premier Hui Xing has not yet been elected and has not contacted Japanese bankers about borrowing money.</p>

<h3>Zhang Gongquan and Others Meet to Discuss Rescuing Rural Bankruptcy, Decline in Rural Areas Symbolized by Continuous Decline in Import and Export Index, Central Government and Banking Sector Should Cooperate to Rescue Rural Areas, Zhang Gongquan Will Convene Banking Sector to Discuss Methods of Social Economy and Taxation</h3>
<p>Zhang Gongquan, General Manager of the Bank of China, has been paying close attention to the actual situation in the interior in recent years due to local unrest and rural fatigue. He previously wandered along the Longhai Railway and went west to Chang'an, and then to Taiyuan for inspection. Recently, he went up the Yangtze River to Sichuan to conduct an investigation. After returning, he had many feelings. He felt that the current rural bankruptcy and financial sluggishness, but the key people in charge of government affairs can have the determination to reform and rescue, and then get the actual assistance of the financial sector, provide capital, and increase the people's production capacity, then the past prosperity of the rural areas may not be without hope of recovery. He is now planning to gather financial giants such as Chen Guangfu, Tang Shoumin, Qian Xinzhi, Wu Yunzhai, and Qi Fuxiao to discuss specific plans for rescuing the rural areas. Our reporter specially explored and recorded the recent plight of farmers and the urgency of the banking sector's rescue plan in detail as follows:</p>
<h3>Decline in Agricultural Exports</h3>
<p>The city's international trade situation in the first quarter shows that both import and export figures have declined compared with last year, indicating that rural bankruptcy is becoming increasingly acute. (1) Grains and products: The average export index in the first quarter of this year was 20.66, a decrease of more than half compared with 53.41 in the same quarter of last year. (3) The index of seeds and cakes: the average index for the whole quarter was 22.81, a decrease of half compared with 21.30 in the same quarter of last year. (3) The index of beans and products: was 1.27, a decrease compared with 1.69 in the same quarter of last year. (4) The index of tea: was 47.37, a decrease of one-fifth compared with 60.58 in the same quarter of last year. (5) The index of tobacco: was 126.01, still less than 147.88 in the same quarter of last year. (6) The index of cotton: was 42.20, a decrease of nearly half compared with 80.93 in the same quarter of last year. (7) The index of silk: was 21.45, a decrease of more than one-third compared with 38.72 in the same quarter of last year. (8) The index of eggs and egg products: was 29.21, also showing a significant decline compared with 35.51 in the same quarter of last year.</p>
<h3>Hongqiao Sanatorium Opened Yesterday, Mayor Wu Held Opening Ceremony, More Than 1,000 Chinese and Foreign Guests Attended</h3>
<p>The Hongqiao Sanatorium in western Shanghai held its opening ceremony for the new building at 3 pm yesterday, and hosted more than 1,000 Chinese and foreign doctors and guests. The sanatorium was built by the Chinese people, and all sectors have given enthusiastic support. The visitors dispersed late in the evening. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the New Building</h3>
<p>The sanatorium's new building, completely in the latest cubist style, is in the form of stacked stepped steps. Standing outside the city, it feels more majestic. The entire building's exterior is in red and white, and national flags are hung all over the balcony, fluttering in the wind, solemn and beautiful. After entering the door, the doctor's office is on the left and the social hall is on the right. The walls are in light green, elegant and pleasant. The first floor has a nursing room, an X-ray room, a sun lamp room, and a doctor's bedroom. The second floor has a sterilization room, an operating room, an instrument room, an anesthesia room, a delivery room, and a pharmacy. The third floor is a chemical laboratory and a nursing room. The fourth floor is a large dining room, a library, a music room, a large kitchen, a small kitchen, a large platform, and a special nursing room, which is divided into a reception room, a bedroom, a reading room, a guest room, and a bathroom. The characteristic of the new building of the sanatorium is that all bedrooms face south, and each room has mutually isolated balconies for lying down and resting. Each floor is indented by six or seven feet, so the light and air in the bedrooms on each floor are exceptionally sufficient. It is indeed the most modern hospital building in the country, and the quiet environment, close to the countryside, is especially suitable for recuperation.</p>
<h3>Visiting Guests</h3>
<p>There were Wu Tiecheng and his wife, Ye Gongchuo, Li Liejun, Xu Shiying, Cheng Qian, Zhang Dingfan, Li Dachao, Li Tingan, Jones, the Director-General of the Public Works Department, Shi Liangcai, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Wang Yiting, Zhu Shaoping, Yu Hongjun, Wang Boqi, Zhang Zhuping, Pan Gongzhan, Wen Hongen, Huang Hanzhi, doctors Niu Huisheng, Nian Huilin, Xu Naili, Ruan Shangcheng, Cai Yumen, Song Guobin, Feng Wuchang, Engel, Bumei, Bode, Finer, Gu Yuqi, Jin Wenqi, Wu Yichu, Fu Wenshou, Li Gang, Tongji and Tongde Medical College, students, and more than 1,000 Chinese and foreign reporters.</p>
<h3>Speech Plaque</h3>
<p>After 3 o'clock, guests arrived one after another, and Mayor Wu held the opening ceremony. The founder of the sanatorium, Ding Fubao, shook hands with each guest as a courtesy. Tea and snacks were served in the west restaurant on the fourth floor. First, Dr. Ding Huikang delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the sanatorium, followed by Mayor Wu's speech, saying that he felt that the scale was grand and the equipment was complete when he participated in the opening ceremony of the Hongqiao Sanatorium today, which added a lot of color to Shanghai. According to the strength of the country, the health of the citizens is very important. I hope that Shanghai will set up a few more such perfect hospitals, and the citizens will benefit a lot. Then Li Tingan, Director of the Health Bureau, gave a speech, saying that it is very difficult to run a hospital, and it is even more difficult to run a good hospital. Now that I see the Hongqiao Sanatorium so perfect, it shows the difficulty of management. I hope that the Chinese people will give more support to promote it. Then Lu Bohong gave a speech, saying that although Shanghai is big, it is the only sanatorium that is not operated by the Chinese people themselves. Although there are many rich people, they are not willing to invest in the operation of the hospital. Now Mr. Ding Fubao and his son Huikang have resolutely donated funds to initiate the establishment of the sanatorium. Their enthusiasm is commendable. Then Xu Naili, chairman of the Doctors' Association, and German doctors Engel and Bumei gave speeches one after another. The length of the speech is omitted.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu and the Owner of the Hospital, Ding Fubao, were photographed by Ye Changlie</h3>
<p>All sectors believe that Mr. Ding's enthusiasm for social undertakings is invaluable. Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Gu Mengyu, Wu Zhihui, Li Shizeng, Cai Yuanpei, Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Dingfan, Wu Tiecheng, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Xingya, Wen Hongen, Kong Xiangxi, Yu Youren, Yu Hongjun, Shen Junchen, Du Yuesheng, Zheng Hongnian, Liu Zhanen, Wang Shijie, Ye Chucang, Chu Minyi, Ye Gongchuo, and others have all given enthusiastic support and donated various valuable machines to promote it.</p>
<h3>Low Prices of Agricultural Products</h3>
<p>Since trade exports have gradually declined, the decline in domestic agricultural prices is also a natural result. Assuming that the wholesale price index of agricultural products in 1930 is 100, the average monthly index of each month last year, the grain category was reduced to 54.73, the textile raw material category was reduced to 79.58, the bean and kernel category was reduced to 57.56, the tea category was reduced to 85.37, and the livestock category was reduced to 95.97. As for this year's monthly index, there is no improvement, but there is no sharp decline, because the price has reached the point where it cannot be reduced any further.</p>
<h3>Cash Concentrated in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The decline in agricultural trade, the decline in prices, and the phenomenon of rural depression are becoming increasingly serious. Due to the lack of stable businesses to do in the interior and the fact that lending is tantamount to throwing it away, groups or individuals with surplus funds are concentrated in Shanghai for safety. For example, the Bank of China's deposits have reached more than 40 million, and the Bank of Communications is also close to 20 million. The Shanghai Bank's commercial and savings departments have a total of 188 million deposits, the Four Banks Savings Association has more than 100 million, the Continental Bank has more than 80 million, and the Jincheng Bank has about 60 million. In addition, there are several other banks with more than 10 million. According to a certain gentleman from the Bank of Communications, the current deposits of all banks in the country amount to about 200 million yuan. The cash that can be reliably loaned to industrial and commercial enterprises with mortgage goods is only about eight or nine-twentieths, and the floating funds are at least more than half.</p>
<h3>Joint Deliberation of Banking Circles on Relief</h3>
<p>The stark contrast between impoverished rural areas and affluent cities represents a social malady. Without urgent remedies, both will suffer. While rural relief isn't solely the responsibility of the banking sector, if the government devises effective solutions, society contributes specialized skills, and banks stand ready to provide funding to support those endeavors. Currently, Mr. Zhang Gongquan, recognizing the urgency of rural relief, is planning to convene leading figures in finance for detailed discussions to collaborate with the government. Anticipated loan categories include:</p>
<p>Production, distribution, secured loans, and credit extensions will proceed on multiple fronts. Loan areas may extend beyond Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to the Northwest, Southwest, Sichuan, and North China regions. To ensure robust financial backing, in addition to individual bank initiatives, the sector may pool resources to avoid past competitive practices and achieve unified action. The goal is to redirect cash that has concentrated in Shanghai back to rural areas, promoting financial circulation in the countryside, restoring urban health, and achieving mutual benefit and shared prosperity.</p>
<h3>Tragic Car Accident in Front of the Great Shanghai Theater - Collision between Car and Trolleybus - One Woman and One Child Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>Qiu Xizhou, a 41-year-old from Ningbo, worked as a chauffeur at the residence of a Mr. So-and-so at No. 145 Pushi Road in the French Concession. His 34-year-old wife, Zhang, suffered from internal ailments, so Qiu obtained permission from his employer to drive the owner's car, Concession License No. 6329/Authorization No. 11725, to take her to Dr. Lao Song, a gynecologist in Hongkou, yesterday morning around 8 AM. Tragically, while driving to the intersection of Xizang Road and Baker Road in front of the Great Shanghai Theater, a child of about ten suddenly ran across Xizang Road. Qiu Xizhou immediately slammed on the brakes. Unfortunately, Trolleybus No. 145 of the French-owned Route 18 was speeding behind them and unable to stop in time, colliding with the car. The impact caused the car to surge forward, knocking down the child, whose left arm was fractured by the car's fender. Simultaneously, Qiu's wife, Zhang, was thrown from the car, landing on the cement pavement, her head striking the ground and causing a severe wound with profuse bleeding. The car's body and glass doors and windows were shattered. A policeman, No. 2671, witnessed the incident, immediately arranged for the two injured individuals to be taken to Renji Hospital for treatment, and recorded the trolleybus and car numbers, along with taking the driver, Qiu Xizhou, into custody for questioning.</p>
<h3>Robbery at Penglai Bank - Several Robbers Arrested - Robbers Hidden in Concession Hotels - Special Court Scheduled to Hear Case This Morning</h3>
<p>The robbery at the Penglai Bank in the Penglai Market in Xiaoximen on the 8th of last month, during which robbers broke in and stole over five hundred yuan in cash, has been solved. After investigation by the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, led by Gu Liancheng, it was learned that one of the robbers, named Zhang San, was hiding at No. 90 Nancang Street outside Xiaonanmen. This was immediately reported to the team leader, and a large number of detectives were dispatched to the address, where they apprehended two robbers, Zhang San and Ma Jinxiang. Zhang then confessed that his accomplices were hiding in Room 36 of the Yuelai Hotel in Mantingfang, Wuma Road. The team then coordinated with Chinese and foreign detectives from the Old Gate Police Station to rush to the hotel the night before.</p>
<h3>Summer Heat Approaching - Japanese Straw Hats Shipped to Shanghai for Dumping - Domestic Hat Industry Has Seen Considerable Development in Recent Years - Annual Production Reaches Approximately Five Million Dozen</h3>
<p>Straw and felt hats are everyday necessities with a broad market. In the past, China relied on imports, leading to significant financial losses. In recent years, domestic manufacturers have quickly caught up, with an increasing number of factories producing high-quality products. However, Japanese straw hats are now being shipped to Shanghai in large quantities for dumping, negatively impacting domestic sales. The recent situation is detailed below.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Japanese Imports to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Reportedly, there are approximately sixty to seventy straw hat businesses and over ten felt hat businesses in Shanghai, with relatively robust operations. Due to strong resistance, Japanese straw hats had not been shipped to Shanghai for dumping for some time. However, according to recent news from the transportation industry, with the weather turning warmer, sales of Japanese straw hats in China have increased rapidly. Last week saw another large shipment, including over five hundred dozen hard-brimmed rough straw hats, all handled by Mitsui and Mitsubishi. The hat industry is paying close attention to this.</p>
<h3>Overview of Chinese Hat Businesses</h3>
<p>Chinese hat factories include Huafu, Shanghai, Zhonghua, Yongli, and Lianhe, among others. Huafu Hat Factory is the largest, producing over two hundred dozen hats per day. All machinery, such as wool selection, blank production, dyeing, steaming, pressing, and gluing, are modern machines. The total annual output of straw and felt hats in Shanghai is over five million dozen, not including satin hats, yarn hats, and children's hats. Domestic straw hats use purely domestic materials. Chinese straw is fine and glossy, resulting in products that appeal to buyers. Domestic straw hats are sold throughout the country. However, felt hat materials mostly use domestic wool, which has not yet achieved the scientific refinement of foreign products. As a result, the softness of the refined fibers is still inferior to foreign goods, which is a significant drawback. The detectives first apprehended Tang Amao, a waiter who had been colluding with robbers. Then, they entered Room 36 and arrested the robber Yang Xingen. Yang, unaware of the detectives' arrival, was enjoying himself with a prostitute, Liu Sannao. The detectives rushed forward and apprehended him. They found a pistol and six bullets on Yang. They also arrested four robbers, Chen Lidi, Ge Yousheng, Fan Jinsheng, and Chen Alin, in Room 46 of the hotel.

<h3>Representatives of the Workers' Petition from the British-American Tobacco Company Discuss the Petition Process</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai British-American Tobacco Company Strike Committee sent representatives Chen Peide, Dong Aosheng, and Xiao Gengsheng to Nanjing to petition the government, requesting the company to quickly resume production, compensate injured workers for medical expenses, and provide relief to unemployed workers. The representatives returned to Shanghai yesterday morning and reported the following on the petition process: On the 14th, the representatives took a night train from Shanghai to Nanjing and stayed at the Anle Hotel. On the morning of the 15th, they first went to the Mass Movement Guidance Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, where they were received by Secretary Wu Zhongheng. The representatives submitted a petition requesting relief. Secretary Wu agreed to accept the principle and proposed a standing committee to discuss relief plans. The representatives, as they had more places to visit, excused themselves. That day, the Central Government held a National Mass Movement Discussion Meeting, attended by representatives from mass organizations in various provinces and cities. The representatives also requested public support from the mass movement representatives and distributed a declaration. The representatives were outraged and promised to boycott British-American products as an effective sanction if the company did not change its attitude. The representatives expressed their gratitude. At 2 PM, they went to the Executive Yuan. Premier Wang was attending a preparatory meeting for the military academy's ceremony and was not available. Secretary Qu Zonghan received them. The representatives reported on the company's unjustified closure of the factory and beating of workers, and stated that the workers had been on strike for a long time and were suffering greatly. They requested the government to provide relief quickly. Secretary Qu promised to report to the Premier for prompt relief. Secretary Qu also said that the Premier would convene relevant agencies from the Ministry of Civil Training and the Ministry of Finance on the 18th to discuss a solution. If the company still refused to accept, the government would only be able to act in accordance with the law and that the government should help to alleviate the workers' suffering. The representatives were satisfied. At 3 PM, they went to the Ministry of Industry, where they were received by Wu Mengyin, Director of the Labor Department, who said that he had sent Section Chief Tang Jianfei to Shanghai to mediate and had fully accepted the demands of the petition. Seeing that it was getting late, the representatives then went to the military academy to visit Chairman Chiang, who was preparing for the military academy's ceremony and was too busy, so he sent duty officer Xu Changchun to meet with them. The officer reported that Chairman Chiang was concerned about the strike and had sent a telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Government, instructing them to handle it properly. Now that the representatives had come to Nanjing, he would convey their demands to Chairman Chiang and would convey the Chairman's concern to the striking workers, urging them to maintain order in order to resolve the matter justly. The representatives left the military academy late in the evening, exhausted after a day of running around, and returned to their hotel to rest. On the morning of the 16th, they went to the Ministry of Finance to visit Minister Kong, requesting relief. However, they were informed that Minister Kong had gone to Shanghai to mediate, so they left a petition and departed. They then went to the Central Party Headquarters to visit Secretary-General Ye Chucang and presented everything in person. At 3 PM, they hosted capital city journalists at the Anle Hotel, with over twenty attending. The representatives reported in turn, requesting the support of the press and media to publish the company's oppression in detail, so that all sectors could understand the truth and provide assistance. They took the night train back to Shanghai that evening. Although the trip was only two days, the results were satisfactory. The representatives, exhausted, rested briefly and then reported the petition process to the municipal party and government agencies, seeking further instructions.</p>

<h3>Industry Announcement to Fellow Tobacco Merchants: Do Not Forget to Affix Stamps When Selling Soda</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South Branch of the Municipal Tobacco Merchants Association recently received reports from members stating that during hot weather, to meet customers' thirst-quenching needs, they also sell sanitary soda. For the Chinese-administered areas, these sodas must be transported from the concessions. Beforehand, members must purchase sufficient stamps from wholesale merchants according to the number of bottles, and only after presenting invoices and waybills can they distribute them to various stores for affixing and sale. Recently, the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau has been conducting strict inspections in the Chinese areas. Small businesses, often with limited manpower, are not fully aware of the stamping procedures. Occasional oversights result in penalties. Many fear the extra burden and cannot afford it. They requested the Association to explain their difficult situation to the tax bureau, asking for special consideration and leniency for minor procedural errors. Upon receiving this information, the branch reported to the executive committee and yesterday announced to fellow merchants, "Members, in selling soda to meet the public's thirst during hot weather, provide a sanitary and thirst-quenching beverage. However, the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau has recently been strictly inspecting soda stamps in the Chinese areas, imposing severe penalties. Since the soda sold by merchants already has stamps, they should be properly affixed to each bottle before sale to avoid omissions or negligence, which could lead to misunderstandings during inspections and result in penalties. Please pay close attention. This is an important announcement."</p>
<h3>The Taikoo Shipping Line Ninghai Returned to Shanghai Mid-Voyage: Route Temporarily Changed Due to Cargo from Andong to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Taikoo company's Ninghai vessel departed from Shanghai for Tianjin on the 15th of this month. As there was no outbound cargo, the vessel was sailing empty.

It is currently taking on coal and making all preparations for departure from Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 19th, bound for Andong. Initial reports in Shanghai indicated that the vessel had just departed but suddenly returned mid-voyage, leading to suspicions of an accident. It was only upon the vessel's arrival in Shanghai that it was learned that the route had been changed. In Andong, since the September 18th Incident, Chinese ships have essentially ceased operations. Taikoo, which previously had dedicated services, has only operated once this year, and this trip by the Ninghai will only be the second.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>The Interest in Reading Literature Books</h3>
<p>(3) (Continued)</p>
<p>The so-called surge of interest, of course, does not mean that it is caused by nothing, falling suddenly from the sky, nor is it a change due to a person's inspiration, a kind of change caused by receiving some kind of unknowable induction. It is determined by living conditions. We often see a person's interests change very strangely and think it is mysterious. In fact, this is not surprising. We only need to look at his life to find an explanation. Conversely, if we want to change our interests, we must first make changes in our life.</p>
<p>For example, if a person used to be fond of reading so-called pure literature works, he considers texts such as applied articles to be very mundane and not worthy of attention. He naturally would not be interested in texts such as applied articles. However, if his life has changed, he is no longer living the life of a literary person, but is busy with paperwork all day long, writing declarations, preparing speeches, drafting telegrams, or compiling lecture notes, writing academic papers, etc. At this time, he cannot fail to pay attention to the use of words in these areas. He will not only not consider applied articles, which he has always considered mundane, to be mundane, but may even suddenly develop an interest in them, because in daily use, even in terms of applied articles, it is possible to show (genius) in their application. The surge of interest can be seen in the transition of life. Some people, because their lives have been greatly stimulated, can also show a surge of interest. For example, the study of Japanese issues was only a personal interest of a few people before the September 18th Incident. But after the (September 18th Incident) (January 28th Incident), the interest in studying Japanese issues has greatly expanded. Many people who usually only read literary works are now also examining Japanese finance. We often see many people who have suffered great failures in their careers, or who have experienced unprecedented tragedies in their families, suddenly turn to chanting scriptures and studying Buddhism. Although in the past some of them were opposed to religion, at this time they have developed an interest in religion. This can naturally also be counted as a surge of interest.</p>
<p>Also, the interests of the rich and the poor often</p>
<p>often change as the rich become poor and the poor become rich, and even interests change. We often see someone becoming rich and looking down on someone else. The other person is very angry, feeling that we were originally the same, why do you have to make it so embarrassing just because you have a few "big" ones? In fact, what makes someone look down on someone else is not the person, but his living conditions. Because life is affluent, everything from the poor era feels boring. In this transition between rich and poor, a phenomenon of a surge of interest will appear for a while.</p>
<p>There are many examples of this, too many to mention. Now, from the opposite perspective, if you feel that you want to study literary theory, but you can't read it with interest, and you extremely hope that interest will suddenly surge, we know that you need to change your life first. Is this artificial change possible? Isn't it a fantasy?</p>
<p>Naturally, there is no problem that changes in life cause a surge of interest. Is artificial change of interest possible? We think it is possible. Because people have active properties, they are not a machine, with no conscious action at all. Taking the example of literary theory mentioned above, you know that you should study it, but you don't feel interested. To change this interest, you must go through the following process. That is, to have an understanding of literary theory, you must first learn the corresponding social sciences. With the basic tools to understand social phenomena, you will have the ability to recognize artistic phenomena and develop an interest in studying literary theory. Therefore, in life, you should create many conditions that will generate interest in social sciences. You should always pay attention to and analyze and observe the first social incidents. In this observation, you will feel your lack of ability. This feeling of lack will lead you to the study of social sciences. The need for practice will generate an interest in research. As long as you reach this step, your interest in literary theory will surge. All of this can be promoted by artificial means.</p>
<p>The (surge) seems to be accidental in form. As mentioned above, the (surge) also has a cause-and-effect relationship. Human behavior must be governed by objective cause-and-effect laws, but it is not fatalistic, because human behavior can also be intentional and can be changed by consciousness. I hope that Gu and Li, in their study of literature, should not only pay attention to the principle of "gradual progress"; they should especially not neglect the "surge," not neglect the acceleration of consciousness in the realization of this "surge," so that the two people's interest in reading literary books "surges" to a more advanced stage.

<h3>Davis Cup European Zone Replay, Australia and France Each Win Singles, French Teenager Mireland Defeats Veteran Crawford</h3>
<p>Czech Republic Leads Italy 2-1 (Reuters, Paris, 16th Dispatch) In the first day of competition in the Davis Cup tennis European Zone replay between Australia and France, an unexpected and amazing result occurred. French youth player Mireland defeated Australia's Crawford 3-1. Fortunately, Australia's McGrass won against France's Pouilles in the first singles, making the score 1-1 and the situation even. The results of the two groups are as follows:</p>
<p>Mireland (France) (4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2) McGrass (Australia) (6-3, 0-6, 6-8, 6-2, 6-2) First Singles The power, determination, and sensitivity were the reasons for Mireland's victory today. Crawford is getting worse and worse, often using the same hitting method, again and again, and each time Mire responds with the same method, leaving him at a loss. Crawford never uses smash shots, and his long shots often encounter difficulties, while Mire's shots are effective in emergencies. In the third set, Crawford collapsed at 3-3. Mire made two mistakes when he had a chance to win this set, but Crawford also made the same mistake, touching the net twice in a row.</p>
<p>Second Singles (Havas, Paris, 16th Dispatch) In the first set against McGrass, Pouilles was slow to react, and McGrass won quite easily. In the second set, Pouilles adopted an offensive strategy, with a faster and more prepared ball, and both forehand and backhand shots were excellent, forcing McGrass to be cautious and take a defensive posture. In the third set, McGrass took the lead with a score of 4-0, but Pouilles quickly caught up, eventually making it 5-5. Finally, he won 8-6. After the break, McGrass became even calmer and won the fourth set. In the last set, Pouilles became increasingly flustered. The balls he hit were easily returned because they landed on the court or were thrown out of bounds. McGrass finally won with a score of 6-</p>

<p>(Reuters, London, 16th) - The annual Anglo-American women's international lawn tennis Wightman Cup match was held, and the United States once again defeated Britain with a decisive score of 5-2, retaining the silver cup for another year. The United States had already taken the lead with 2-1 on the first day, but in the remaining four sets on the second day, the United States won three more, bringing the total to 5-2.

<h3>Palfrey Defeats Scriven</h3>
<p>Palfrey was the most valiant player in this year's Wightman Cup. Scriven won the first set, but lost the second set due to overconfidence. Scriven led 5-1 in the third set, but during a crucial week, Palfrey delivered three consecutive powerful shots, averting the crisis and putting on an even more brilliant performance, coming from behind to lead 6-5. Scriven tied it at 6-6, but Palfrey finally won 8-6.</p>
<p>Knothe Defeats Cowcock - This set was an unexpected and intense competition, with wonderful power shots and drop shots. Knothe's stamina and excellent corner shots exhausted her opponent, leading to her defeat. Knothe continued her victory from last year.</p>
<h3>United States Wins Doubles</h3>
<p>Mrs. Godfrey and Miss Knothe returned to the court to great acclaim, and their performance was still excellent. Palfrey was the weaker player in the American team, but she gradually improved after the first set, eventually leading to victory.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers vs. Baihong Track and Field Meet - Many Promising Newcomers</h3>
<p>The Postal Workers and Baihong teams held a track and field meet at Hongkou Park yesterday morning. The two sides were evenly matched, with each having their ups and downs. The results of each event were generally average, but the emergence of several promising new talents was encouraging.</p>
<p>400 Meters - Bob Wang of the Postal Workers, whose recent times have been between 57 and 58 seconds, was expected to win the championship. Unfortunately, he was tripped by a teammate at the start. He struggled to get up and catch up, still managing to pass many people, which was quite remarkable.</p>
<p>800 Meters - Fu Yuanxiang of Baihong, the elementary school 800-meter champion, ran with a light and crisp style yesterday, achieving an excellent record of [blank] minutes and 14.4 seconds. Fu's strides and sprints have been well-honed. He ran more and more bravely after entering, surpassing the others by more than ten meters. When he reached the finish line, Cheng Jingguan, Chen Xuzhou, and others rushed forward to congratulate him. Gu Huiyuan, who was highly regarded for his skilled training, fell behind. Fu's performance was outstanding among all the participants and he was considered a champion for a time. This is quite remarkable for a child.</p>
<p>1500 Meters - Zhou Zhiren of the Postal Workers defeated Bao Yibi to win the championship. Zhou has rather long legs and is indeed a middle-distance talent who uses large strides. He followed Bao closely all the way, never leaving him. He made a strong sprint 100 meters from the finish line, winning applause from the entire field.</p>
<p>High Jump - Li Zhenying's first result was average. Wei Zhengshan, who is only seventeen years old, jumped with remarkable coordination. Given time, he will surely excel.</p>
<p>Long Jump - Feng Yuanchang, who shocked everyone at the inter-school games with a record of 6.09 meters, the highest this year, had too many fouls yesterday and did not perform well, which was a pity. Zhang Guanhong of the Postal Workers is also a good player in this event, but because he participated in too many events, he was unable to fully demonstrate his abilities.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Requires All Secondary and Higher Education Institutions to Establish Scholarships - Scholarships for Students with Excellent Academic Performance and Conduct - Financial Aid for Students from Impoverished Families - Quota is 10% of the Total Student Population</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou Correspondence) The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, based on the middle school and normal school regulations issued by the Ministry of Education last year, stipulated that scholarship funds should be established. Furthermore, according to the Ministry's order, starting from the 23rd academic year, new scholarship methods should be formulated, and the criteria should not be limited to impoverished families. Furthermore, Article 56 of the Provisional Constitution during the Period of Political Tutelage stipulates that all public and private schools in the country should establish free and scholarship quotas to reward students with excellent character and academics who are unable to continue their education. Therefore, it is necessary to comply with these regulations. Previously, we had included the proposal to establish various scholarships and promote opportunities for impoverished students to enter schools in this year's administrative plan, and we also issued the "Outline of Methods for Scholarships and Financial Aid in Counties and Cities of this Province" for implementation. Now, we have separately drafted the "Provisional Measures for Student Scholarships in Zhejiang Provincial Secondary and Higher Education Institutions" and the "Provisional Measures for Student Financial Aid for Impoverished Students in Zhejiang Provincial Secondary and Higher Education Institutions." The former encourages diligence in study, while the latter supports the impoverished, so that the original intent of the Provisional Constitution and the Ministry's orders can be implemented through regulations. These two measures have been approved and implemented at the 688th meeting of the Provincial Government. The original "Zhejiang Province's Measures for Subsidizing Impoverished and Excellent Students in Provincial Secondary and Higher Education Institutions" will be abolished. All students in provincial schools who achieve excellent results in the graduation entrance examinations this year may be eligible for scholarships. Students who perform well in the provincial school entrance examinations during the summer vacation, and who come from impoverished families, may be eligible for financial aid. The two original measures are extracted as follows:</p>
<p>Provisional Measures for Student Scholarships in Zhejiang Provincial Secondary and Higher Education Institutions</p>
<p>Article 1: The Zhejiang Provincial Government establishes scholarships to reward students in provincial secondary and higher education institutions who have excellent academic performance and conduct, and will be awarded to those who meet the requirements of these measures.</p>
<p>Article 2: Scholarships are divided into two types, A and B, each with four levels. They will be awarded according to the provisions in the table below, and scholarship certificates will be issued (the format of the certificates will be determined separately by the Department of Education).</p>

At the same time, students who have already received financial aid in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for Student Financial Aid in Zhejiang Provincial Secondary and Higher Education Institutions" will not be awarded scholarships.</p>
<p>Article 5: At the end of each semester, after the school examines the student's grades and determines the eligibility, (for the final semester, the graduates of the meeting) shall be based on the results of the graduation meeting, within one month, the names, gender, place of origin, department, enrollment month and year, and current grade, conduct sports and academic performance scores of the qualified students, and the proposed scholarship amount shall be prepared in a list and submitted to the Education Department for approval.</p>
<p>Article 6: After the Education Department approves each semester's scholarships, it will announce the names of the students who should receive scholarships and issue the scholarships and scholarship certificates to each school for distribution. The students will issue receipts, which will be collected by the schools and submitted to the Education Department for verification.</p>

<p>(3) Students of the Provincial People's Education Experiment School who receive subsidies from their native county.</p>
<p>Article 4: Students who wish to receive financial aid must obtain an application form from their parents or guardians, as well as a certificate from the director of the Education Bureau or the head of the Education Section of the city or experimental county (certifying their place of origin and impoverished family situation), and submit it to the school for review.</p>
<p>Article 5: After receiving the application forms, the schools should review them in detail and make a decision. No later than three months after the start of the semester, they should prepare a list of qualified students' names, gender, place of origin, department, current grade, enrollment month and year, family occupation, economic situation, academic performance, conduct, and sports performance scores from the previous semester (new students should be based on their entrance examination written test, oral test, and physical examination results), and the level of financial aid to be awarded. The list should be submitted to the Education Department for approval, along with supporting documents for each student.</p>
<p>Article 6: The quota for financial aid is temporarily limited to 10% of the total student population of each school.

<h3>Zhejiang Department of Education Orders All Schools to Restrict the Use of Domestic Paper and Pens - Cultivate the Habit of Practicing Calligraphy</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education notes that foreign goods are flooding the market, especially stationery, with paper and pens being the most prevalent. The number of students who can write with a brush is decreasing daily. Almost all paper used in schools is foreign-made. The domestic paper industry is in crisis. Therefore, a notice is issued to all schools stating that, except for kindergarten and lower primary school students who may use hard-nibbed pens, all compositions and exercises in Chinese language courses, as well as regular term and entrance examinations, must use writing brushes and domestic paper. This will gradually be extended to civics and history and geography subjects, with the aim of cultivating the habit of practicing calligraphy and achieving the benefits of cultivating character.</p>

This item was trained by Principal Du, and the performance was skilled, neat, and praiseworthy. The Boy Scout flag language performance was skilled in movements and accurate in angles, showing that regular training was effective. The "Rainbow Skirt" tune was melodious and lively, and it was also rare to see. In addition, the Affiliated Primary School's imitation exercises and bubble-blowing performance were also excellent. It is reported that the school will be enrolling students in the fall. Those who are interested in</p>
<p>physical education are welcome to apply.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Misty Records of the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Original Author: Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Some used silk woven with the pattern of wintersweet already on it to make clothes; some hired workers to embroider wintersweet onto plain silk; some used gold thread and silk thread mixed together for embroidery, depending on the wearer's status and financial ability. The Empress Dowager or the Emperor never interfered. There was also a group of poorer women, although unable to afford such exquisite items, but they tried their best to imitate, thinking that being able to imitate more closely was more glorious; as long as the flower style was similar, the price or beauty of the raw materials was not a problem. However, there was always a defect that the poor could not make up for, and that was fur clothing!</p>
<p>In the spring, cotton clothes and lined clothes were worn one after another. The clothes in spring were always embroidered with peony flowers. The peony flower is known as the "king of flowers" in China, and can be considered the most magnificent and luxurious flower. Therefore, those beautiful women wearing clothes full of embroidered peony flowers in the spring were particularly charming! And although the patterns were prescribed, the color of the clothes could be freely chosen, so every woman tried her best to choose the most brightly colored fabrics. Dressed up like this, they themselves were as beautiful as a peony flower! When spring passed and summer arrived, cool gauze clothes came into being; at this time, the patterns on the clothes were changed to lotus flowers without prior consultation. In the autumn, thick silk or woolen lined clothes and chrysanthemums of various colors replaced the gauze clothes and lotus flowers. Year after year, it always rotates like this.</p>
<p>Throughout the four seasons, the wives of wealthy officials dressed up like rainbows every day; even the wives of lower-ranking officials never allowed themselves to be too casual, and always tried their best to dress up with what they had. Dressing up is originally an expression of women's love of beauty, and of course it is not only Chinese women who are like this! (60)</p>
<h3>Wheelbarrow</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The giant wheels of the times are constantly turning; various means of transportation have also evolved from animal power and manpower to machines. However, the roads of Shanghai are really strange. The 20th-century motorcycle car is speeding like lightning, while the 18th-century wheelbarrow is still being pushed along, squeaking. The cart drivers hold the cart handles with both hands, and hundreds of pounds of things are pushed forward by their brute strength. Needless to say, in hot weather, even in cold weather, when I look at the cart drivers, they are wearing a single shirt, their chests are exposed, and the beads of sweat on their foreheads roll down like raindrops; their rapid breathing seems to be panting. This is really a strenuous task! However, in order to eat, and because they cannot immediately change careers, they have to risk their sweat and blood, and use their strength to push hundreds of pounds of goods, competing with freight cars for business.</p>
<p>The wheelbarrow can also carry people, but it is rare to see it in the concessions today. In the past, when silk factories had not closed down, at dawn and dusk, one could often see seven or eight silk reeling women sitting together in a wheelbarrow, with their</p>
<p>lunch baskets and rice bowls hanging on the cart handles; many frivolous young men followed behind the cart, commenting and joking. This is also one of the scenes in Shanghai, and you may have seen it!</p>
<p>In the four villages of Shanghai, such as Pudong, Wusong, and Jiangwan, there are still such wheelbarrows soliciting passengers. The carts are cleaner than those used to carry goods in Shanghai; and there is also a broken cushion on both sides. However, people who are not used to sitting on them will first experience numb feet; encountering bumpy roads, their buttocks will also be shaken painfully. If you don't believe it, you may wish to try it there.</p>
<p>In the age of steam and electricity, this inhumane wheelbarrow should be abolished. However, we are an economically backward country, where will these wheelbarrow drivers go?</p>
<h3>Biography of a Garret Writer</h3>
<p>— Shen Xin</p>
<p>The garret writer is a young man with a white face, red lips, a handsome suit, and shiny leather shoes, who walks very spiritedly.</p>
<p>From everything about this garret writer, I know that the garret writer does not really live a life of eating flatbread and wearing tattered clothes. Looking at the garret writer, not only are his clothes beautiful, but he never deigns to walk on foot when going out or coming in.</p>
<p>The writer once told me that a masterpiece of his had been written from the age of sixteen to the present age of twenty-four, and had not yet been completed.</p>
<p>I don't remember what day it was, but the garret writer invited me to talk, and because I had never been to the writer's room, I immediately went to visit, taking this opportunity to take a look around.</p>
<p>Who knew that it would be fine if I didn't go in, but going in made me strange. Everything in the writer's room was completely different from the writer's actions. The writer's beautiful clothes contrasted with the lowliness of the writer's room, and the writer's noble actions contrasted with the messiness of the writer's room.</p>
<p>As soon as I went in, the writer politely asked me to sit down, and then asked me to drink tea. After a long time, the writer finally opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>What the writer said really made me feel inexplicable, and I was stunned.</p>
<h3>The Nation Strives Unceasingly</h3>
<p>After half an hour, I finally replied to the writer: "Why bother, women can only be obtained with money, otherwise no matter how great your skills." After the writer heard this, he nodded and shed a few tears.</p>
<p>Who knew that after that day, the writer didn't go out for three days, sighing early and sighing late, not crying, but sleeping, not sleeping, but crying, making the neighbors secretly scold him. The writer may have woken up, and went out again as before, and his clothes were as beautiful as before.</p>
<p>Recently, a smile has appeared on the writer's face, singing "Sister, I love you" in the garret in the morning and "There are many beauties on the Peach Blossom River" at night, and he is unwilling to even look at the people living in the same house.</p>
<p>This is the "Biography of a Garret Writer."</p>
<h3>Recent Poems by Jielou</h3>
<p>— Geng Bai</p>
<p>Companionship</p>
<p>It's always hard to get rid of worries, perhaps it's a connection from a past life. When will the silkworm spin a cocoon to bear fruit? It's like a swallow building a nest with mud in its mouth. How many times have I been startled by the bright cherries in April? Twice I've passed the beautiful years of maidenhood. (Note 1) I am gradually fading and you are also getting old, will companionship be proven (Gradual hexagram)? (Note 2)</p>
<p>(Note 1) I have traveled with you to Houhu several times to pick cherries and returned, and you are now twenty-six years old. (Note 2) I recently divined with the I Ching and obtained (Dun becoming Jian).</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>The letter soothes my uneasy mind, perhaps there is warmth in the unspoken words? The soul dreams of contradictions, the lungs and liver suffer from resentment and favor. I don't know who to connect my life with, I want to make deep affection surpass that of siblings! The swallow-like youth has an icy and snowy appearance, and the sea and sky are sunny with a single boat.</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 30: Witnessing the Sad Geese, Burying Heads to Defend the Homeland; Bullets Piercing Strong Arms, Sprinkling Blood to Dye the Lonely City</p>
<p>Even this one could not reduce this difficulty. He looked for many stalks of sorghum and dry leaves and lit a fire on the line where he was digging the trench. He burned the ground until it was warm and the soil was loose. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he immediately raised his hoe and dug down. The brothers in the company that Ziqiang led dug a trench five feet deep and five zhang long for most of the day under these difficult circumstances. At this point, everyone was exhausted and could no longer dig. Ziqiang still raised his hoe and dug down. A large pile of sorghum stalks was piled in front of him. In the freezing wind, a short, shaking flame emerged, surrounded by thick black smoke. The smoke, carrying soot, kept rushing towards people's faces. In addition to being covered in soot, Ziqiang also had snot and tears streaming down his face. He didn't look like a person at all, he looked like a ghost. But he still raised the hoe and worked continuously. Although these brothers were tired enough, when they saw the company commander working so hard, they could not help but grit their teeth and continue to work behind him. It was not until four or five o'clock in the afternoon that Baofang sent a messenger to stop Ziqiang and let him go to the battalion headquarters to listen to instructions. Baofang smiled and nodded at him, saying, "Company Commander, you are very loyal and brave. However, we have to know the importance of things. Now that you have exhausted your strength, when the enemy attacks, you will not have the strength to resist. The reason I want to dig another trench is to add another layer of difficulty to the enemy's tanks. But we still have two trenches behind us? Let's deal with those first. Now, you take your brothers to rest. We have something to do tonight." As he spoke, a faint smile appeared on his face, as if he was saying that he was very lucky to be able to open fire tonight. When Ziqiang was digging the trench in the field, he was standing next to the fire, and his body and face were smoked until they were a little hot. Only his hands were relatively cold. After working for a while, he would hold his hands and rub them to warm them up. (411)</p>

<h3>A Short Trip to Sheshan</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Sheshan in May is as lively as Suzhou and Hangzhou in March. In Shanghai, perhaps because the distance is not far, traveling to Sheshan is not as troublesome as going to Hangzhou, so those with leisure time will go to Sheshan to roam one after another. Although I am not a person with leisure time this time, in order to change the air, and to put it more happily, I went to Sheshan for a trip with a few friends.</p>
<p>To go to Sheshan from Shanghai, you must first take a train to Songjiang, and then change to a small boat to go to Sheshan. Although the distance is twelve miles, sitting in a small Shaoxing boat the size of an egg, you cannot straighten your legs and you cannot raise your head, like sitting in a prison for two hours. This boat trip is also</p>
<p>a unique experience, sitting in the boat, sometimes chatting, sometimes looking at the scenery, with the withered yellow wheat and tender green seedlings reflecting each other under the blue sky and white sun, there is a kind of natural color.</p>
<p>In the clear water and green pools, boats, large boats, small boats, and motor boats float towards Sheshan one by one. It was not easy to pass two hours of prison life before arriving at Sheshan. Looking from a distance, Sheshan, which I had not seen for three years, still looks the same. The round hilltop is full of lush green trees. Among the trees, several white Western-style houses are vaguely visible, and there is also a tall spire hidden in the jungle.</p>
<p>Getting out of the boat and stepping onto the shore, because the river in front of the mountain was already full of boats, the waterway was already blocked. So, if you want to go to the mountain front, you have to walk a distance. The uneven mud road is hard to walk. The residents beside the road are all poking their heads out to watch us pass by. After a few turns and more than a mile, we arrived at the front of the mountain. At the entrance to the mountain, there were temporary stalls selling things everywhere. People were squeezing up the mountain in batches.</p>
<p>The mountain road is very wide, and the road surface is newly paved with a layer of yellow sand. After walking a section of flat road, there is a section of stone steps, only a dozen or so, so climbing the mountain is not laborious, and it is much easier to walk than Lingyin and Tianzhu in Hangzhou. The green bamboo and green trees on both sides have covered the sky so that people climbing the mountain cannot see the sun. When you reach Zhongshan, flags and umbrellas are fluttering everywhere. Red and green lights and colored paper are embellished among the green trees and green branches. In a tall church, the sound of believers praying and chanting scriptures reaches the entire valley. Along the way, there are several statues of gods sculpted in the jungle and cliffs.</p>
<p>If you want to see a thousand miles, go up another floor. When you reach Zhongshan, you naturally want to go to the mountain top. This section of the mountain road is not as wide as the one below, and the slope is also steeper, so it is much more difficult to walk. By the time we climbed to the top of the mountain, we were all panting. At the top of the mountain, there is a church under construction, which is still not fully completed. Behind it is the observatory, a dome-shaped roof, standing on the top of the mountain, which can be seen from a distance, as if it is the symbol of Sheshan.</p>
<p>This is the period just after noon, and the sun is hanging diagonally in the southwest corner. Standing on the top of the mountain, if you look around intentionally or unintentionally, the intersections of rivers and the vertical and horizontal paths form a bird's-eye view. Looking into the distance, the surroundings are just a gray-black circle, but the water of the Huangpu River forms a white line, and the smog group of Greater Shanghai is gray and yellow all day long, and you can make it out vaguely.</p>
<p>We watched on the top of the mountain for a while, and then we went down the mountain from the other side. At the beginning, there was a cross pavilion, and male and female believers were all kneeling in front of the pavilion praying and chanting scriptures. The road here is even flatter, and you don't feel like you are climbing the mountain, because it is connected in a zigzag shape, with a total of ten corners. Each corner is a pavilion. In the pavilion</p>
<p>There are sculptures of the ten images of the Lord's suffering, the so-called Stations of the Cross. When believers go up the mountain, they must kneel and pray in front of each pavilion.</p>
<p>After going down the mountain, I saw the river in front of the mountain was full of boats, seven horizontal and eight solid, large and small, all kinds of boats, returned along the original road, walked past a small hotel, and felt hungry, so I went in and ordered a few dishes, and a meal cost more than a thousand yuan for three people, which is much cheaper than in Shanghai. Rural life is still much lower than urban life. Taking a boat back to Songjiang, it was already evening. Because of the invitation of relatives and friends, I stayed in Songjiang for the night.</p>

<h3>A Study of the Reasons for Disputes Between Doctors and Patients</h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>Recently, lawsuits involving doctors and patients have arisen one after another. That physicians, who harbor intentions of universal salvation, and patients, who come with faith for treatment, cannot both achieve their goals and instead end up in the unfortunate situation of meeting in court is a great misfortune in society. Some say this is a sign of moral decline, but in my opinion, the structure of the world is not so simple. Apart from a very few cases with genuinely justified reasons, the issue can be attributed to seven causes, which can be explored as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Misunderstanding of Contract: Medicine has fallen into the plight of a profession and is bound by law. It cannot escape the principle of equal rights and obligations. Regarding the establishment of a contract, this contract is completely different from the principle of exchanging goods. It is a contract where one party fulfills technical obligations and the other fulfills corresponding compensation. The object is the technique, not the result obtained after the technique. Therefore, doctors cannot guarantee the life of a patient; this is a common practice throughout history and around the world. Because people are living bodies and diseases are not fixed objects, it is impossible to interpret and treat them in the same way as repairing machines. Today, in society, this point is often misunderstood. It is believed that the purpose of seeking medical treatment is to cure the disease, but it is not understood that the doctor's obligation is not whether the disease is cured but whether the technique is properly performed. If disagreements and requests for punishment are made because the disease is not cured, implying the doctor failed to fulfill obligations, then doctors must be controlled by life insurance companies to treat diseases. In short, for diseases with no certainty of cure or for weak bodies, the only option is to refuse insurance and not provide treatment, letting nature take its course. However, even today, life insurance companies still cannot avoid unexpected compensation for losses. This is why living bodies are different from ordinary goods and machines and cannot be viewed the same way.</p>
<p>(2) Misapplication of Emotions: Compassion is inherent in everyone, but since not everyone can have Mozi's universal love, there will inevitably be distinctions between close and distant. The concern of patients and their families cannot be the same as that of doctors. In fact, doctors treat diseases without engaging in scheming or exhausting themselves emotionally. Why is this? Curing a disease is the doctor's only joy, only honor, and only duty. If, unfortunately, a cure is not possible, their conscience should be clear and they should feel the same grief. There should be no doctor who enjoys a patient's death. However, patients' families are often swayed by emotional impulses, forgetting their circumstances and ignoring the truth, leading to rash and reckless litigious behavior. Even if it does not end in complete ruin, it will certainly result in a lose-lose situation. The patient's family may think that this way, they are not failing the deceased in the afterlife, but in reality, they are misunderstanding the role of emotions, akin to a drunken dance, providing amusement for sober passersby.</p>
<p>(3) Misjudgment Due to Superficial Understanding: Only the doctor knows the patient's illness. The treatment method is also known only by the doctor, especially the doctor who personally examines and treats the patient knows the most details. Even other doctors, without careful investigation and research, are still in the dark. How can laypeople, the patient's family, claim to be able to point out your mistakes and improper treatment? Looking at past cases of disputes between doctors and patients, the patient's side often points out various errors in the treatment as evidence for conviction. In our opinion, these are mostly like a summer insect talking about ice, of little value. Although there may be one or two relevant points, they have mostly been corrected by other doctors. People do not understand that the condition of an illness changes rapidly, and even the attending physician cannot predict or prevent it. They often adapt their approach to the situation and improvise to provide temporary relief. We absolutely cannot use the analogy of carving a mark on a boat to find a lost sword or gluing the strings of a zither to insist that something is an unchangeable principle. Looking at past medical disputes, the patient's family mostly failed. This is because they misunderstood with a superficial understanding, showing off their cleverness, and thereby trapping themselves.</p>
<p>(4) Shifting Responsibility by Colleagues: Distinguishing right from wrong with clarity and integrity, without biased favoritism or kicking someone when they are down, is the mark of a virtuous person and a man of integrity. However, some shallow-minded individuals, fearing trouble will befall them, eagerly seek to shed responsibility and do not hesitate to set traps. Even without the intention to provoke, they effectively encourage litigation. Patients' families, temporarily misled by slanderous words, rashly initiate lawsuits. This is something that those shallow-minded colleagues cannot be excused for. Examining past litigation cases, one often finds that the final doctor is not held accountable for the death, but the initial doctor is sued, or the initial diagnosis is attacked as a reason for litigation. Examining these facts, it seems that the doctor involved is using a tactic to shirk responsibility and protect themselves, willing to trap their colleague in prison. This is unrighteous and unethical, truly regrettable.</p>
<p>(5) Pursuit of Money: As mentioned in the contractual agreement, the patient's obligation is to pay money as compensation. However, people often misunderstand this, believing that the cure is the price for the money. Therefore, in the unfortunate event of death, they are unwilling to fulfill this obligation and resist by refusing to pay for the diagnosis and treatment. This is what the common saying refers to as "losing both money and life," which they are unwilling to accept. If the doctor insists on fulfilling the contract, it will inevitably lead to extremes, pursuing litigation. There are many examples of this, especially between doctors and patients who are not economically well-off. One party is unwilling to give up their contractual rights, while the other party cannot bear the additional financial burden, making this situation inevitable.</p>
<p>(6) Convenience of the Profession: Lawsuits require lawyers and depend on newspapers for publicity. Therefore, lawyers can draft and file lawsuits without cost, and reporters can easily arouse public opinion without having to ask others for help. Patients associated with these two professions may inadvertently become involved in litigation. This can be seen in past historical events. Evidence proves the fact. However, we do not want to point out the specific individuals or incidents. However, there are also those who use individuals from these two professions as their background and act as puppets themselves.</p>
<p>(7) Purpose of Extortion: Medical treatment is necessary for illness and requires fees. However, in people's habits, medical expenses are never included in the budget. Therefore, when illness suddenly occurs, except for the wealthy, most people have to raise money to pay for it. However, the general public believes that money can buy life. If life cannot be bought, funeral expenses are still necessary. Therefore, they use their ingenuity and turn to the doctor. Thus, it often happens that after a patient dies, they ask someone to demand funeral expenses, and if this is unsuccessful, they resort to litigation. If the patient recovers, but they have no money to pay the medical expenses, they may create trouble to extort money, or out of jealousy of the doctor's fame, they make threats to vent their anger. This is even worse. As for detaining doctors and forcing them to sign documents, these are crude acts of the ignorant class and are not within the scope of this article.</p>
<p>Alas, the world is deteriorating, and morality is declining. Previously, there were cases such as Yi Ruichang of Zhenjiang suing Wang Yuanchen, Tian Hemen of this city suing Yu Songyun, and the Wang Xuefei family of Hangzhou suing Qiu Boxun, which were the most well-known. However, in terms of medical theory, they all lacked a foothold, and they all lost their lawsuits. These cases were not based on genuine grounds for accusation but were exploited by the above seven objective factors. Their failure was inevitable. However, the future is long, and there are many impulsive individuals in the world. They often have clear insight in ordinary times, but they fail to see the overturned cart ahead and still insist on trying it themselves, adding to the world's boring and unexpected disputes and wasting the court's countless false words. In the end, a commotion amounts to nothing. What benefit is there for either side? Some say that these cases all seem to be based on accusations of negligence and manslaughter, but in reality, the background is all about financial gain. Because only by first winning a criminal case can a civil case be attached. If this is the case, the doctor can also sue the other party for false accusation if they lose the criminal case and seek compensation for direct and indirect damages. Alas, as far as the eye can see, such events are constantly happening in the country, and a new drama is unfolding: the entanglement between Shen Wenda and Ge Chenghui and Zhu Changya has arisen again. In this long-obscured society, who knows what will happen in the dark in the future? It is hoped that honest colleagues, wise countrymen, impartial officials, and honorable patients will not be misled by the smokescreen of the above seven objective factors and pay attention to them and study them. This would not only be the fortune of the medical community but also the blessing of society.</p>
<h3>Pharmaceutical Chemical Industry and National Economy</h3>
<p>— Jin Wu</p>
<p>What we need daily, to name the most important, is clothing, food, and shelter. With the progress of civilization, manufacturing and improvement have become increasingly complex. In short, the completion of all items is directly or indirectly related to chemistry. Therefore, people with knowledge in today's Chinese society, seeing the flooding of foreign goods and the decline of the national economy, often call for the promotion of the chemical industry. Is there no reason for this?</p>
<p>The scope of the chemical industry is extremely broad. Here, I will discuss only a portion of it, the pharmaceutical chemical industry. I hope that those with similar interests will discuss and study it to further develop industrial manufacturing. This may also benefit the spirit of national independence and the remedy of the national economy.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical chemical industry includes vitamins, endocrine products (HormonPraparate), plant-based drugs (PtlanzlicheAtzneistoff), chemotherapeutic drugs (Chcmetherapie), alkaloids (Alkaloide), condensing agents (Kcnerastmirrel), anesthetics (ＮａｒｋｏｒｉｎｄＡｎａｌｇｅｔｉｈａ), cardiotonics (Ｈｅｒｚｍｉｔｔｅｌ), etc. Various countries are researching, innovating, and creating these drugs to open a new era in the field of treatment and increase the wealth of the nation. They work tirelessly. Now, looking back at our country, all chemical pharmaceuticals are imported. Even the raw plants used in traditional medicine, such as dried tangerine peel, gambir vine, and peony, which are products of temperate zones, are imported in large quantities due to the decline of agriculture, according to customs reports. How can we achieve self-sufficiency? Although there are several pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai, they are limited by economic resources and talent and only engage in pharmaceutical preparations, such as pills, powders, ointments, elixirs, water, and wine. The actual raw materials still rely on others. If this continues, the source of economic strength will inevitably be exhausted. If the country is in trouble, transportation is blocked, and foreign goods are cut off, the sick and wounded soldiers and the diseases of the people will inevitably be left to die!</p>
<p>Secondly, the treatment of infectious diseases of livestock, especially cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep, is crucial to the national economy. In the past, farmers relied on fate for animal husbandry, not investigating the source of disease or treating the sick. This was enough to survive when science was not developed; however, when livestock died in epidemics, it could lead to family ruin. Now, international competition is fierce, and our failure will be taken over by others. Therefore, the management of livestock must move towards improvement. The chemical synthetic drugs, serums, and vaccines needed for treatment in the future all fall within the scope of the pharmaceutical industry. Germany uses vaccines for swine erysipelas (ScbweineRotlaut) and swine fever (ScbweinePest), and arsphenamine (Neusalvarsan) for equine pneumonia (Brustseude) in large quantities. The treatment of grain diseases is a key research area for chemists, physicians, and biologists. This also falls within the scope of the pharmaceutical chemical industry. Its importance to the national economy is self-evident.</p>
<p>On average, about 30% of fruits are damaged by plants and animals. If we use appropriate drugs for treatment, we can definitely increase production. After Germany used effective treatment methods, the price of fruits increased by 150 million marks annually.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the treatment and prevention of human diseases and the prosperity of agriculture rely heavily on the pharmaceutical chemical industry. If we can research by category and build our country's pharmaceutical chemical industry in order, the benefits will be far more than just the national economy!</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge Q&amp;A about Diseases</h3>

<h3>Common Knowledge of Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene (3) Epistaxis (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>When it comes to the symptoms of epistaxis, there is really nothing special to talk about. When people see blood flowing from the nostrils, they call it epistaxis. However, due to different causes, the bleeding situation is also different. For example, traumatic epistaxis from a blow to the nose occurs immediately after the blow. Epistaxis during nasal surgery is usually the most severe two or three hours after surgery. Because the local anesthetic used during surgery mostly has a local anemia effect. This effect only lasts for two or three hours, then disappears, resulting in reactive hyperemia and bleeding. In patients with increased blood pressure or polycythemia, there is often a feeling of pressure in the head, heaviness, dizziness, tinnitus, etc. before epistaxis. Bleeding can also be caused by strenuous labor or sneezing. Epistaxis usually bleeds from one nostril. When there is a large amount of bleeding, the blood can also pass through the posterior nasal aperture and bleed from both nostrils. Sometimes one nostril bleeds, but the other nostril does not. But in the front of the nasal cavity, blood stagnates. In this case, it is often difficult to determine which side the epistaxis is coming from, but we doctors always have a way to determine it. Speaking of the amount of bleeding in epistaxis, it is also very interesting. That is, when the amount of bleeding is small, the blood flows out in droplets. When the amount is large, it overflows like a spring. At this time, the blood often flows into the throat and is coughed up from the mouth or mixed into the sputum. Patients often mistake it for hemoptysis from lung disease, causing fear. If the blood flowing down from the throat is not coughed up from the mouth but swallowed into the stomach, the blood in the stomach stimulates the mucous membrane, causing nausea and vomiting. Sometimes blood can flow from the nasopharynx through the Eustachian tube (this tube is a pathway connecting the nasopharynx and the middle ear) and flow into the middle ear, causing ear bleeding or otitis media. If the amount of epistaxis blood is more than one liter (one liter is one thousand cc), the patient will develop acute anemia. His symptoms are dizziness, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, weak pulse, pale face, sweating, syncope, etc. Sometimes it can even lead to shock or even death from severe epistaxis.</p>
<p>The prevention method of epistaxis. The first and most important thing is to explore its cause. Among the local causes, the first, second, fourth, and third items of traumatic epistaxis mentioned in the previous issue can be known and avoided by oneself. For example, epistaxis caused by local lesions in the nasal cavity is the same as epistaxis caused by tumors in the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, or nasopharynx. It is impossible to determine and treat it without a doctor's examination.</p>
<p>First aid for epistaxis 1. Keep your body and mind calm. Do not panic. 2. Relax your neck. Raise your head. So that the congestion in the head can be reduced. 3. Body position. It is best to take a sitting position. Or a semi-recumbent position. 4. If you know that the epistaxis is coming from the front of the nasal septum. You can press the wing of the nose on the bleeding side tightly against the nasal septum with your fingers. Or use clean cotton. (Medical sterile cotton is the best) Insert it into the nostril on the bleeding side. 5. An ice pack can be placed on the bridge of the nose. Or a cold wet cloth. If this first aid method is used and the bleeding does not stop. There must be some special reason. The safest way. Just quickly instruct a specialist to examine it in detail. As for the drug hemostasis method and instrument hemostasis method for epistaxis. Because it does not belong to the scope of common sense of hygiene. So I will also use this to complete the topic of common sense of epistaxis without explaining it.</p>

<h3>Hongqiao Sanatorium</h3>
<p>腥) Red hot blood pressure increasing disease was mistakenly printed as blood pressure (decreasing) increasing disease</p>
<h3>Introducing the Hongqiao Sanatorium</h3>
<p>There are many sanatoriums at sea, but most of those with more modern facilities are owned by Westerners. The reason for this is partly an economic issue, but the inability of Chinese doctors at sea to unite and the government's failure to support them are also major reasons. Now, Mr. Ding Fubao of Wuxi has independently created the Hongqiao Sanatorium. His goal is to build a hospital suitable for Chinese people with Chinese strength and to be managed by Chinese people, and he is willing to contribute this hospital to the new medical community across the country. Therefore, its equipment is not only comparable to Western countries but even surpasses them. Special attention is paid to all aspects of medicine, nursing, and meals. Now it has been completed, and I am deeply pleased that it can increase the position of the Shanghai medical community, so I am happy to introduce it. (Editor)</p>
<h3>Overview of Our Hospital</h3>
<p>Design The entire hospital was designed by Mr. Xi Fuquan of Qiming Architectural Firm and finalized after many discussions with a number of specialist doctors over a long period of time, and Anji Construction Factory was commissioned to build it. The style of the entire building is a stacked stepped shape. The special feature is that the sanatorium room section faces completely south, and each room has sufficient light and air. Moreover, people standing on the upper terrace can see the actions of people on the lower terrace. The terraces on the same floor are also mutually isolated for resting in a reclining position (see the cross-sectional view of the sunlight line). In short, the entire building's interior and exterior are simple and beautiful, making it the newest building in East Asia.</p>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>The hospital buildings are divided into two buildings, large and small, both in the form of cubes. The larger one is four stories high, and the smaller one is one story high, mutually isolated. All are built with steel-reinforced concrete. Not only is the project sturdy, but there is no risk of fire. The entire wall also pays great attention to sound insulation.</p>
<p>Wards All bedrooms in the hospital have electrical equipment, hot air heaters, and hot and cold water pipes. All kinds of pipes and wires are hidden inside the dark walls, and all corners are made semicircular so that dust does not accumulate and disinfection can be easily carried out. Quietness is the most important element in a sanatorium, so rubber flooring is installed in the corridors, which is not only beautiful and clean but also avoids the sound of footsteps.</p>
<h3>Operating Room</h3>
<p>Most of the light in the operating room comes from the north, without the glare of direct east-west light. If surgery is performed at night, the latest shadowless lighting equipment is used. The room has a light gray rubber floor, and there is no sound of walking during surgery to disturb people. It is also easy to rinse and disinfect. Next to it are a doctor's dressing room, an equipment room, and a disinfection room. If surgery is performed in the summer, there is air conditioning to avoid the suffering of the hot weather.</p>
<h3>Delivery Room</h3>
<p>The delivery room is next to the operating room and has various new facilities, which are especially convenient to use.</p>
<p>The ShockProof, which has all seismic equipment, can be used by anyone coming to the hospital at any time. It is absolutely safe and has no danger. Shortwave diathermy is also the latest invention in medicine and has extremely powerful therapeutic effects. Our hospital is the first to equip it to meet the needs of all sectors.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>The treatment and preparation aspects are all the latest methods. Whether chemical, physical, or stimulating therapy, and artificial pneumothorax can be performed. It is very easy to be effective for upper tracheal branch diseases, and various lung disease patients, such as tracheal branch asthma, pleural membrane inflammation, etc., as well as neurasthenia symptoms. This is because the rural climate and urban air are vastly different in terms of purity. Weak and anemic children who need to use stimulating therapy are especially suitable for recuperating in the hospital. Also, those with incomplete heart function are not suitable for alpine sanatoriums, and it is easier to restore their vitality if they live in the countryside for a long time.</p>
<p>Special Announcement</p>
<p>Our hospital has a Ford eight-cylinder ambulance equipped with the latest industrial pneumatic tires, so it is extremely stable when driving Traffic</p>
<p>For the convenience of transportation, our hospital has a minibus that travels between our hospital and Jing'an Temple (the waiting place is the Xueliang Photo Studio across from Jing'an Temple), running four times a day, twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon. Please call (21955) for the time.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Our hospital was determined after a long period of planning by a number of specialist doctors and architects. In addition to practicality and hygiene, it also takes into account the habits of the Chinese people. This is the beginning of our Chinese people building a sanatorium by ourselves. It is also the crystallization of the common care of our comrades and colleagues.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (9)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 4: The Progression of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>(4) The fourth way it spreads is through the patient's phlegm and saliva to other parts of the body. It spreads from the upper part of the lungs to the trachea and throat. It can also reach the intestines through swallowing phlegm and saliva from the throat. On the other hand, organs like the urinary system, kidneys, and bladder, which excrete urine and feces, can also be invaded. There is also the portion of phlegm and saliva that cannot be discharged externally, which can continue to spread to other bronchial branches. The most common site for this is, of course, a part of the lower lobe of the lung. This kind of invasion in all directions progresses endlessly. Once you understand this, then the reason why pulmonary tuberculosis is so stubborn and difficult to treat, I think readers should have a general understanding of it!</p>
<p>Having read the various points mentioned above, we can now give a simple report on the progression of pulmonary tuberculosis! We know that the initial sites of infection for pulmonary tuberculosis are the apex of the lung and the bronchial lymph nodes: (According to recent theories, it is in the part of the lung below the clavicle.) If the bronchial lymph nodes are in a state of caseous necrosis, it can progress from there through the lymphatic vessels, and the lungs will be successfully invaded! Because the end of the lymphatic vessels is close to the veins, there is also a chance of invasion of the vascular system. In addition, symptoms like coughing and phlegm can cause the disease to progress and spread to other organs.</p>
<p>Regarding the initial infection of pulmonary tuberculosis, each person and invasion is, of course, not limited to one time. However, after one infection, there is a considerable amount of immunity; although this immunity is not as decisive as diseases like smallpox, measles, and typhoid, which almost prevent a second infection for life; however, the second infection is generally milder. Of course, there are exceptions that are often seen; for example, in childhood, those who have had lymph node and bone tuberculosis often develop proliferative pulmonary tuberculosis later in life, and as a result, suffer from acute miliary tuberculosis and die. But this is, after all, a minority.</p>
<p>The progression of pulmonary tuberculosis has been roughly discussed above; then, we must also ask: what kind of changes do the various tissues undergo during its progression and cessation? This is the part of ordinary pathological anatomy. It is very complex and cannot be fully explained in a few words, so it can only be left to a special chapter below!</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Classical Chinese | Vernacular Chinese | Mass Language</h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Now some people have shouted the slogan "Revival of Classical Chinese," while others advocate "Opposing the Revival of Classical Chinese," as if the long-halted debate between classical and vernacular Chinese is about to be re-enacted.</p>
<p>In fact, the debate between classical and vernacular Chinese has long been decided. It's not that the classical Chinese of Lin Qinnan, Zhang Xingyan, and other gentlemen was not well written, or that they couldn't keep up with the ancients; it's just that Chinese society has reached a certain degree of change. Once the foundation moves, the entire old culture shakes, and the literary revolution is just one aspect of it. This general trend will naturally have many twists and turns, but standing on the side of decline, whether an individual or the stratum to which they belong, although they can still struggle a few times, the final victory will not belong to them, even though their courage must be admired.</p>
<p>In short, the debate between classical and vernacular Chinese is long over. Although we hear the slogan of "Classical Chinese Revival" now, we don't feel it's that serious. As for individuals writing a few articles in classical Chinese for some necessity, as long as it doesn't have a bad impact on society and doesn't poison the masses, it seems that it can be tolerated for the time being. Since the dispute between classical and vernacular Chinese has been expressed and will not be mentioned again, I think what needs to be raised now is to go a step further than vernacular Chinese and advocate mass language literature. The reason for this is not very profound or complicated, just to put it very shallowly and simply, although the vernacular Chinese of the past ten years or so is closer to the masses than classical Chinese, the facts tell us that this is obviously not enough. Current vernacular literature is just something for the intellectual class, not what the general public needs. To add a simple sentence, it's just because this kind of vernacular is not the language of the masses.</p>
<p>In the past, in order to remedy the many shortcomings of classical Chinese, it was necessary to advocate vernacular Chinese. Now, in order to correct the many shortcomings of vernacular literature, it is necessary to advocate mass language.</p>
<p>The so-called mass language here includes the language and characters that the masses can speak, understand, and see clearly. The standard mass language seems to still need to be defined by the works of future mass language writers. The most important thing is to first look at the current level of education of the masses, and also think about what level of education the masses should receive in the future.</p>
<p>The so-called masses here, of course, can be broadly said to be the entire population of the country, but the main elements are still the peasants, who account for more than 80% of the total population, as well as handicraftsmen, new-style industrial workers, small businessmen, shop assistants, peddlers, and so on. In terms of the current level of education of the masses, it is a pity that there is no precise survey and statistics to base it on, so we can only roughly say that some have received so-called new-style primary school education, some have only received old-style private school education, and some have only received a year or a few months of remedial education, literacy education. In addition, very few have received new-style secondary or higher education, and the number of illiterate people is the largest. That being said, it is not difficult to imagine what level of language and characters the current masses can speak, understand, and see clearly.</p>
<p>Therefore, the mass language literature I am talking about must, on the one hand, be suitable for the language and characters used by the masses, and on the other hand, it must also improve the cultural level of the masses. If there is a need for Europeanization in language and characters, it is okay to Europeanize, but don't just put on the airs of a student who has studied abroad or understands foreign languages for personal reasons. If there is a need to use classical Chinese vocabulary, it is okay to use it, but don't just put on the airs of a scholar of Chinese studies or understands ancient texts for personal reasons.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, mass language literature must take into account speaking, listening, and seeing in the three categories of poetry, novels, and drama. Special attention should be paid to listening. It should be easy to understand. Because whether it is reading aloud or singing and playing poetry, being easy to understand is a necessary condition for penetrating the masses. Why was Bai Juyi's poetry so popular in society at that time? Why are Mr. Li Jinhui's songs so popular today? In addition to other conditions, being easy to understand is probably an important reason. As for the performance of dramas, although actions and gestures can help the public understand the plot, the important thing is that the dialogue and lyrics can be understood by the public. And although novels today do not have to be told to the public by storytellers, being able to read them in a way that is almost like speaking is also a condition for penetrating the masses.</p>
<p>Because I saw the essays of Mr. Xu Maoyong and Cao Juren on classical Chinese, I skipped vernacular Chinese and went a step further, advocating mass language in literature. I have tentatively put it forward in this rough way, and I am listening to everyone's insightful opinions.</p>
<h3>Dreams and Ideals</h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>The weakness of humanitarianism is that the surgeon gives the patient an excessive amount of chloroform, which on the one hand alleviates the patient's pain, but on the other hand makes people permanently blind. The ethics of Chinese society mostly follow this kind of malpractice.</p>
<p>Old, new, Chinese, Western, all kinds of anesthetics are really numerous! The harm to life is no less than opium. To take a Chinese product as an example, it is "Life is like a dream"!</p>
<p>Throughout history, scholars, if they are not fools, but intellectuals with the vision of thinkers, are mostly unsuccessful in their time. If they are unsuccessful, they have grievances, and after grievances, they are often followed by desolation. Tao Yuanming can be considered a detached hermit, but he cannot avoid having leisure sentiments; Qu Yuan was even more unsuccessful, and unwilling to admit "Life is like a dream," he finally couldn't live on and drowned himself. Jia Yi was also unwilling to be muddled, and finally died young. Until Buddhism prevailed in China, the philosophy of life as a dream also flourished. From then on, most of those who wanted to commit suicide became monks, which can be considered the effect of this anesthetic.</p>
<p>If everyone thinks that life is like a dream, then they will be both crying and laughing, not knowing whether Zhuang Zhou dreamed of being a butterfly, or the butterfly dreamed of being Zhuang Zhou? As a result, they will be calm and peaceful, anyway, it's just a dream that passes by carelessly. Those who have been hit can find comfort, and those who hit others can indulge in their actions. It's just a dream, why bother?</p>
<p>From then on, ignorance also obliterates the feelings of right and wrong. What is impossible in a dream? The hungry dream of eating stones, and the stones can be eaten; the avenger dreams of killing people, and the enemy is killed because of it; what a freehand thing this is? So, at this time when right and wrong are useless, it may as well tell people to treat life as a dream.</p>
<p>However, dreaming is not good.</p>
<p>European society often produces geniuses, and their careers often succeed, but they are idealists, not dreamers. Chinese society also often produces geniuses, but they are mostly dreamers, not rational. Their demeanor is as if they can live for a thousand years, and they plan for all mankind and for future generations, but our demeanor is to be slightly self-sufficient and to have a spring dream. You can see this by looking at various scientists and writers.</p>
<h3>On "Intellectuals"</h3>
<p>— Da Kun</p>
<p>In the Free Talk of June 12th, Mr. Xu Maoyong said: "I look down on the so-called intellectuals of today, at least I look down on intellectuals like me." What kind of intellectuals are they? They are those who "are actually useless and pretend to be intellectuals, eking out a living in the loopholes of the social system." This is naturally correct. But if we do not regard the so-called intellectuals as so narrowly defined and so fixed, then it is difficult to say whether today's intellectuals are really completely useless. The way out for intellectuals is actually not limited to "helping the rich" and "suicide." There is also a more important way, and that is to realize that they are wrong and strive to "take off their long gowns." Mr. Xu said that the "long gown" of "intellectuals" is like Sun Wukong's golden hoop, easy to put on but difficult to take off. This is indeed a heartfelt statement, but it is ultimately because they do not have the courage to take it off. If they strive to take it off and strive to do it, I believe that Mr. Xu's "long gown" will eventually disappear like Sun Wukong's golden hoop in front of the Buddha.</p>
<p>Look, didn't Akita Utori of Japan finally take off his "long gown"? If it is said that intellectuals should be looked down upon, it is only those intellectuals that Mr. Xu is talking about. Who says that those intellectuals (or intellectuals) who are striving to take off their "long gowns" are useless?</p>
<h3>Immortal Hall</h3>
<p>— Qian Ying</p>
<p>On the morning of May 30th, I accompanied Xiao Sha to Meilong to find the living immortal. Originally, Xiao Sha was also a modern girl, but because she had her nerves confused by many old propaganda, she heard that the living immortal of Meilong could bring Xiao Sha's mother from the underworld to the yang world, and could hold Xiao Sha and her mother to tell a story. Now, for her own mother, she showed her own contradictions.</p>
<p>That day, I took the Shanghai-Hangzhou train with Xiao Sha. Although Xiao Sha was so lovely, I was a little annoyed with her at that time. A girl who was full of new ideas, her reason would be so impulsively disturbed by emotions, it was really unexpected. In the train car, I argued with her for a long time, and it turned out that the train arrived at Meilong without getting off, and arrived at Xinzhuang, and then used two feet to drive backwards.</p>
<p>It was six miles from Xinzhuang back to Meilong. The sun in May was honestly impolite, and the hearts of a pair of young people were melted together by the sun. Xiao Sha wanted to meet her dead mother. What about me? I was willing to fight the sun with my face for Xiao Sha's sake. If the immortal was spiritual, why wouldn't I be willing to meet Xiao Sha's mother too? Walking along the railway, the only people on the road were the villagers returning from Longhua. The village road was meandering and meandering, really limited people. After walking for half a mile, I had to ask for directions:</p>
<p>"Old woman, how much further is it to the Immortal Hall?"</p>
<p>"Young master, are you going to summon the dead? There are still three miles to go!"</p>
<p>"Old man! How much further is it to the Immortal Hall?"</p>
<p>"Heh, do you foreign gentlemen from Shanghai also believe in immortals! The Immortal Hall is over there, across the stone bridge, it's that white house." I intentionally looked at Xiao Sha. Walking to the front of that white house, there was a sign with Wisteria Pergola XX number but no words of Immortal Hall. A small field was full of plump wheat that had just been harvested. An old woman and a middle-aged woman stood outside the side door looking around.</p>
<p>"Is this the Immortal Hall?" Xiao Sha eagerly asked the middle-aged woman. The middle-aged woman looked at the old woman and replied, "What are you looking for?"</p>
<p>"Aren't you the ones who can call the dead to the yang world? We want to call the dead to the yang world to ask questions." Xiao Sha still honestly stated her intention like a child. The old woman asked if we had come from afar from Suzhou, and also asked if we were very devout in worshiping the great immortal here, etc., so she allowed us to go inside.</p>
<p>"Where is the living immortal?" Xiao Sha asked the middle-aged woman after drinking a cup of water. The middle-aged woman smiled and pointed to the old woman who was taking incense candles and said, "That's my mother!" I was always drinking tea and not speaking. Xiao Sha was very devout and talking to the middle-aged woman.</p>
<p>"We haven't summoned the dead for a long time. Now we can only treat people's illnesses. People nowadays often don't believe in our immortals, so we can't make a living by summoning the dead. Since you have come from afar, we can't refuse your request. Let's summon them for you."</p>
<p>Following the old woman, we walked into the left wing, opened into a dark room, and we shivered. It was furnished with ghost money, candles, and incense. A square table and two long benches looked like we had entered a ghost world. The old woman sat down, and Xiao Sha and I also sat down. Dozens of paper ingots were burned. The air in the room was eerily quiet. There was the mystery of ghosts here, and everything would confuse the hearts of young people.</p>
<p>The old woman asked Xiao Sha to explain the name of the deceased, and the county map, etc. The old woman closed her eyes and chanted words. The ghost said that the deceased wanted chariots and horses, and that people in the yang world should burn money and grain. Xiao Sha immediately burned paper ingots and knelt down, really like welcoming her mother. At that time, I didn't speak and used the clear mind of an observer to quietly observe.</p>
<p>The old woman, for a moment had a stomach ache, headache, cough, yawn, rolled her eyes, and moved her hand forward, making a ghost face, groaning, scaring Xiao Sha's face white.</p>
<p>The old woman called, "Mom is here!" So Xiao Sha knelt again, stood up, and the old woman helped Xiao Sha's hand to speak.</p>
<p>"Ah Nv! My mother is thinking of you in the underworld. Are you thinking of me in the yang world?" Xiao Sha replied "Thinking of you," and tears flowed down emotionally. The old woman immediately came to pull my hand, and regarded me as Xiao Sha's father, and said a lot about establishing a family and career, and finding a satisfactory husband for her daughter, and that a wife would not be in vain for having a good husband like you. When the old woman said this, Xiao Sha had stopped crying, glanced at me, and listened to her continue!</p>
<p>"You and your father must be good, and your mother will bless you in the underworld to be strong and healthy, and be promoted and get rich. If your father wants to marry a stepmother, you will suffer in the future. You must not allow him to marry!" Turning back to me, she said: "Do you promise me, not to marry a woman, do you promise me?" The old woman put on a stern face towards me. Xiao Sha's tears were gone, she smiled, and I also smiled. The old woman's face turned red. For a moment, there was another stomach ache, headache, cough, yawn, rolling of the eyes... a low voice "I'm leaving." The old woman returned to her original expression. Ah! Heh, she sighed two ghost breaths.</p>
<p>Xiao Sha also regained her original clear reason, took out ten cents of silver, and was eager to leave.</p>
<p>Walking back along the railway, I took Xiao Sha's arm and said, "Do you believe it? Ghosts, immortals, otherwise you would have to call me daddy?" "Really unlucky, and I even knelt down to her three times," like acting in a ghost play. Xiao Sha was a little regretful.</p>
<p>The white house gradually left us, Immortal Hall! Immortal Hall!</p>
<h3>In the Country Road</h3>
<p>— Wang Yixin</p>
<p>Although the road is so rugged, it is also a warm road: when I step on a foxtail grass, a piece of gravel, a wild flower, X X X</p>
<p>The narrow country road is so soft, the sunset in my hometown is so warm and loving, I saw the child of my childhood, the innocent landscape is substantial, although the road is so rugged.</p>
<h3>Guiying's Father (3)</h3>
<p>— Hua Zi</p>
<p>It was on the day of my so-called "discovery," at about four o'clock, I was sleeping in bed when I was suddenly awakened by a loud noise. Listening carefully, this voice belonged to Guiying's father, and it seemed to be a speech. I got up in a hurry, and my wife and the others had already gone downstairs. I also went to the store downstairs. My wife said to me, "It's erupting." So I paid attention to watch. A large crowd of people was also gathered in front of the store, mostly women and children from the neighborhood. The owner of the grocery store opposite also put down his novel and was watching.</p>
<p>Guiying's father was standing in front of the counter, naked to the waist. On the counter was a large bowl of wine, and four or five peanuts, all belonging to him, but he had no time to eat them.</p>
<p>"...Kill! Kill! Should kill! This old woman!" he said, raising his hand.</p>
<p>He lowered his bald head slightly forward, shaking it left and right. His thick eyebrows arched upwards, his large eyes widened upwards, and his mustache curled upwards. In short, everything on his face, even his muscles, struggled upwards as much as possible, but his bald head and wrinkled forehead struggled to suppress them, which made Guiying's father's expression seem furious, but actually he was enduring it.</p>
<p>"What's the use of not killing her, this crazy thing! She can't move at all. Cooking and washing clothes are all my business, and she still wants to sell sweet potato flour. She enjoys the blessing, sits and eats, and still nitpicks at me. Today, by three o'clock, she sold all the sweet potato flour. I was very happy. But this old thing started scolding me. She said that the business was so good today, why didn't I make more in the morning, otherwise I could have earned a few more dollars. She scolded me for being lazy. In fact, how much to make in the morning was entirely her own idea. She said that she couldn't sell it all yesterday, the business was not good, so it's better to make less today. I listened to her, but she complained to me in return, this ungrateful old thing! I want to kill her, what's the use of raising her? I earn and eat on my own, and go wherever I want, how happy! I still have the ability, and I still have the strength, you see me drink wine."</p>
<p>His gaze swept around the audience, and finally focused on the wine bowl. So he held the bowl with both hands, lowered his head even more, brought his mouth to the bowl, closed his eyes, and drank the wine. As the wine decreased, his head and the bowl gradually rose. Finally, his face and the bottom of the bowl were facing the sky. Only after drinking a large bowl of wine in one breath did he open his eyes, take a breath, and return the empty bowl to the audience. "Finished, hahaha!" he laughed, wiping his mustache with the back of his left hand.</p>
<p>There were a few sparkling beads of wine on his mustache. A large one flowed from his chin, through his neck, chest, and all the way to his navel. His pants were tied very low, and his fat belly was exposed.</p>
<p>"A Ren, another bowl, ... Haha! When I was a soldier before, I could really drink, ten big bowls in one breath, I didn't care at all, and the partners praised me, Leprosy Head Three can do it! Not cheating, only those who can drink have the ability. That year, I fought in the Hangzhou theater, all the way with fists and feet, everyone was afraid when they saw me. Now Leprosy Head Three is old, and I can only drink two big bowls of wine, but I still have the ability to drink two big bowls of wine, you see... look!"</p>
<p>He shouted loudly, and punched the counter with all his strength. The people watching were startled, and then laughed.</p>
<p>"Who can withstand this punch? If my wife took this punch, wouldn't she sink into the ground? But I don't hit, I don't hit. I want to kill her with a knife, with a knife, snap!..."</p>
<p>"Old hag, it's time to go home, you're drunk and going crazy again, what kind of appearance is that!"</p>
<p>This was Guiying's mother speaking a few words through the crowd, hobbling past the door of the restaurant. Her lonely eyes and lonely incisors looked even more terrifying than usual. She was carrying a basket, so she said a few words and walked away.</p>

<h3>Observing the Movement of the Mark from German Debt</h3>
<p>— Tan Bingwen</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Since England and the United States successively abandoned the gold standard, the world's monetary system has entered a state of chaos. These two countries are the largest investment and creditor nations in the international arena, wielding de facto control over the entire world economy. Changes in their standard monetary systems inevitably exert a decisive influence on other nations. Looking at the countries within the so-called gold standard bloc, all are uneasy and constantly face the possibility of abandoning the gold standard. France, due to its unique financial institutions and the particularly developed nature of its market, has narrowly avoided abandoning the gold standard despite numerous rumors. Italy and Switzerland have also recently expressed intentions to devalue their currencies. The German Central Bank (Reichsbank), known for its strength, has been using it to implement strict exchange controls, striving to maintain the gold standard. Focusing on the latter: Germany is the world's largest debtor nation, obligated to repay huge sums of cash to other countries. As the global economic crisis deepens, more and more creditor nations are requesting the return of their loans, leading to a surge of capital outflow. Consequently, the gold reserves of the central bank have drastically decreased, making it impossible to address issues both externally (stabilizing foreign exchange rates) and internally (rediscounting and open market operations). The central bank is the financial hub of a country, and if it falls into a state of financial distress, the entire national economy will suffer. Nowadays, devaluation and exchange dumping are becoming a trend among major capitalist countries, making the recent talk of a mark devaluation not a baseless rumor, but something with a basis. Let me explain the reasons below.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Germany is the world's largest debtor nation, and the most significant factor affecting its national economy is debt repayment. The future of the mark is closely tied to this. Therefore, observing the mark from the perspective of debt relations, to understand its movement, may not be in vain. According to a recent survey by the Berlin Institute for Economic Research (Ronjunkrlndriut), Germany's current external debt situation is as shown in Table 1.</p>
<p>Table 1: Germany's External Debt (Unit: Billions of Marks)</p>
<p>Creditor Nation June 1930 June 1933 March 1934</p>
<p>United States 7.4 3.3 3.57</p>
<p>United Kingdom 1.6 1.4 1.30</p>
<p>France 0.9 0.3 0.35</p>
<p>Netherlands 2.3 0.7 0.87</p>
<p>Switzerland 2.0 0.7 0.80</p>
<p>Belgium 0.2 0.1 0.09</p>
<p>Italy 0.2 0.1 0.17</p>
<p>Sweden 0.3 0.1 0.12</p>
<p>Other Countries 0.3 0.3 0.30</p>
<p>Total Long-Term Debt 15.5 7.1 7.57 6.50</p>
<p>United States 3.9 3.1 3.22</p>
<p>United Kingdom 1.4 1.0 1.08</p>
<p>France 0.4 0.2 0.26</p>
<p>Netherlands 1.6 0.7 0.75</p>
<p>Switzerland 1.6 0.5 0.54</p>
<p>Belgium 0.1 0.0 0.06</p>
<p>Italy 0.0 0.1 0.15</p>
<p>Sweden 0.1 0.0 0.09</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia 0.1 0.1 0.12</p>
<p>Denmark 0.0 0.0 0.04</p>
<p>Other Countries 0.5 0.2 0.26</p>
<p>Bank for International Settlements 0.6 0.3 0.32</p>
<p>Total Short-Term Debt 11.1 6.2 6.69 5.00</p>
<p>We can trace the growth and decline of Germany's external political and commercial debts (excluding foreign capital invested in the form of purchasing securities, land, and operating businesses). In mid-1930, it reached its peak at 26 to 27 billion marks. Afterward, due to the outbreak of the financial crisis in July 1931, creditor nations withdrew their funds to expand their domestic credit, leading to a significant decrease in Germany's external debt. By June 1933, long-term debt had decreased to 7.6 billion marks, short-term debt to 6.7 billion marks, totaling only 14 billion marks. By the end of March this year, it had further decreased to 11 billion marks. Since its devastating defeat in the European War, Germany has been living on borrowed money, using new loans to repay old debts (what is called "Converlion" in public finance), which has been the only means for Germany to revive its industry and commerce. The reduction in debt indicates that foreign investors are hesitant to invest, while Germany is experiencing credit tightening, a lack of currency, and falling prices.</p>
<p>Examining the reasons for the decrease in foreign capital, they are nothing more than the following: (1) the withdrawal of foreign creditors, (2) the decline of the pound and the dollar, and, arising from this, (3) the stagnation of foreign trade. The first item is beyond the scope of this article, so let us put it aside and focus on examining items (2) and (3). Indeed, in the long term, the devaluation of the pound and the dollar can lighten Germany's debt burden. However, this is only a long-term effect. In the short term, the devaluation of the pound and the dollar puts German export trade at a disadvantage, and the damage it suffers is more than enough to offset the benefits of a lighter debt burden. As foreign exchange reverses, Germany, maintaining its old parity, will inevitably feel the disadvantage of exports. Germany is a debtor nation and an industrial nation. It needs huge amounts of foreign capital to run the machinery of its domestic industry. Domestic industry obtains foreign capital to develop and generate profits, and a portion of these profits is used to pay off debts. The development of industry relies on smooth exports as a prerequisite. As mentioned above, the standard currencies of countries like England and the United States have devalued. The German exchange rate has fallen, export trade is sluggish, and domestic industry is greatly affected. There is no arguing with facts, so let us prove this with numbers.</p>
<p>Table 2: Germany's Foreign Trade (Unit: Millions of Marks)</p>
<p>Year Imports Exports Surplus (+) or Deficit (-)</p>
<p>1930 10,393 12,036 (+) 1,643</p>
<p>1931 6,727 9,599 (+) 2,872</p>
<p>1932 4,667 5,739 (+) 1,072</p>
<p>1933 4,204 4,871 (+) 667</p>
<p>First Quarter of 1934 1,148 1,094 (-) 54</p>
<p>(Note) Source: 1930 to 1933 figures are based on the Japanese Diamond Economic Magazine, Volume 22, No. 7, page 48. 1934 figures are based on the London Economic Weekly published on May 12.</p>
<p>Accordingly, German export trade was most prosperous in 1930, reaching 12 billion marks. However, imports in the same year also reached over 10 billion marks, so the surplus was only over 1 billion marks. In the following year, both imports and exports decreased as a result of the economic crisis. Fortunately, the decrease in imports exceeded the decrease in exports, so the surplus was 2 billion marks, breaking all previous records. Afterward, both import and export trade decreased, and the trend of shrinking surplus was even more pronounced. By the first quarter of this year, there was even a deficit of 54 million marks. Under these circumstances, goods cannot be exported, domestic inventories are increasing daily, and prices are plummeting, exacerbating the domestic economic crisis. According to the London Economic Weekly published on May 12, the German wholesale price index was 126.4 in March last year, falling to 101.9 in the same period this year. The cost of living index also fell from 187.7 to 116.6 during the same period. The clouds of prosperity have dissipated from Germany!</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Germany's international trade is sluggish, and its international income has greatly decreased. However, the amount of Germany's external debt to be repaid has not decreased. Not only has it not decreased, but it has also increased. According to a report by the German Foreign Debt Survey Office (AnmeldestellefurAuslandsschulden), the principal and interest that Germany should repay in the 1933|34 and 1934|35 fiscal years are as shown in Table 3.</p>
<p>Table 3: Germany's External Debt Repayment Amount (Unit: Millions of Marks)</p>
<p>Interest Principal Repayment (Amortization) Total</p>
<p>Long-Term Debt 613 154 767</p>
<p>Short-Term Debt 435 126 561</p>
<p>Total 1,048 280 1,328 Above are the actual expenditures for the 1933|34 fiscal year</p>
<p>Long-Term Debt 350 160 510</p>
<p>Short-Term Debt 100 40 140</p>
<p>Other 380 180 560</p>
<p>Total 830 380 1,210 Above are the estimated figures for the 1934|35 fiscal year</p>
<p>From this, we can see that Germany's foreign debt payments last year were 1.3 billion gold marks. In other words, Germany re-exported 1.3 billion marks overseas last year to settle international lending relationships. In the past, Germany's international lending relationships relied on trade surpluses to compensate. Now, trade surpluses last year were only over 600 million marks, and the amount was not enough to cover the expenses of foreign embassies and other international expenditures. Under these circumstances, Germany exports large amounts of cash, leading to a daily decrease in the central bank's gold reserves. Germany's war debt for the 1934|35 fiscal year, due to the agreement in February 1933, was partially reduced with the consent of the creditor nations, so the total amount of debt payments is approximately 1.2 billion marks. However, even this amount is very harsh from the perspective of Germany's national economy, which is in a difficult situation. For this reason, starting from the 9th of this month, the German Central Bank resolutely suspended all payments owed by German merchants to various countries for fifteen days. This measure is sufficient to prove the urgency of the central bank's currency situation. Its serious nature is self-evident (see the Havas dispatch in the 9th Shen Bao). According to reports, the German Central Bank's reserves have shown a significant downward trend since the beginning of this fiscal year, and the trend has been even more pronounced in the past two months. A look at several items in the German Central Bank report published in the recent (May 12) London Economic Weekly will make this clear.</p>
<p>Table 4: German Central Bank Issuance Reserve Status (Unit: Thousands of Marks)</p>
<p>1933 1934 May 7 May 6 April 30</p>
<p>Gold 400,799 219,292 183,583</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange 99,395 5,848 7,409</p>
<p>Reserve Ratio 9.10/0 6.80/0 5.40/0</p>
<p>The German issuance system adopts the so-called flexible issuance system. In detail, its legal cash reserve ratio is 40 percent, but one-fifth of this can be short-term treasury bills and foreign exchange bills. When market demand is extremely urgent, the central bank may temporarily be unable to find sufficient cash and may issue beyond the limit, but the government must levy an issuance tax on it. Looking at the table above, on May 6 of last year, it was still 9.10/0, but on May 7 of this year, it fell to 5.40/0, a decrease of 1.40/0 compared to last week. According to the latest reports, on the 6th of this month, gold decreased to 111 million, and the reserve ratio decreased to 3.40/0 (Shen Bao, 10th). A Havas dispatch from the Times on the 12th even said: "...The German Central Bank, from now until July 1, will reduce its paper money reserves to around 90 million marks... then the reserves will be reduced to 2 percent..." This phenomenon, though unseen even during the Great War, is self-evidently serious. (III)</p>
<p>Although the German financial sector is in such a difficult situation, it would be presumptuous to say that it will implement devaluation based solely on this. According to a Berlin dispatch from the Xinwen Bao on the 13th, German officials have denied rumors of abandoning the gold standard. However, what we cannot help but suspect is that before England and the United States abandoned the gold standard and devalued their currencies, their national leaders also made similar statements. Drawing an analogy from this, we are halfway there. Furthermore, Germany's current Minister of Finance, Count Schwerin Von Kroigk, recently made a statement saying: "Whether or not the mark is devalued is merely a matter of trade policy. If the devaluation of the mark would make German exports smoother, then we would be happy to use it. However, it is still doubtful whether this goal can be achieved after devaluation, so we do not want to take unnecessary risks at present." (See Page 1025 Vol CXVIII NO4733 London Economic Weekly.) From this, it is clear that the Hitler government, while not admitting that it will lower the value of the mark, is paying attention to this issue.</p>
<p>Devaluing the currency and implementing inflation in tandem will, in effect, reduce the burden on debtors. Any economist understands this. For example, the Reuters dispatch in the Shen Bao on the 12th said "...The German government plans to lower the value of the German currency next month based on the current exchange rate of paper money, which is equivalent to lowering it by 40 percent." If so, Germany, which previously bore a debt of 100 marks, now only bears a debt of (effectively) 40 marks. The German economy, as of today, has reached a dead end. There was a proposal to suspend war debt payments for two years (see the Reuters dispatch in the Shen Bao on May 12), but it was not implemented due to opposition from the United States and Sweden. Borrowing new debts to repay old debts is like drinking poison to quench thirst, making the disaster even worse. Since these two methods cannot be used, will an attempt to devalue the mark be put into practice one day? Completed at the Business School on June 13</p>
<h3>An Overview of Global Wheat Production and Sales</h3>
<p>— Yang Xianxu</p>
<p>Since the world suffered from the economic crisis, all products (industrial and agricultural) have felt an imbalance between production and consumption. In recent years, the serious problem faced by wheat producers is how to maintain this supply and demand. Therefore, on August 25th last year, the International Wheat Agreement was established in London, stipulating that major wheat exporting countries should limit the sale of their national accounts, and at the same time reduce the area of wheat planting. However, major importing countries are extremely permissive regarding wheat imports, so producers still try their best to plant, regardless of actual consumption.</p>
<p>At the London Wheat Conference, it was estimated that importing countries would need approximately 560 million bushels before July 31, 1934. The distribution of each country's exports is as follows: Canada 200 million bushels, the United States 47 million, Argentina 110 million, Australia 105 million, Danube countries 54 million, the Soviet Union and other countries 44 million.</p>
<p>Regarding the recent situation in the international wheat market, we can excerpt the conclusions published by the Food Research Institute of Stanford University in California, USA.</p>
<p>In 1932-33, the world's wheat supply felt overabundant again. Although the harvests of the Danube countries and the United States have decreased, the harvests of various European countries that originally imported have been particularly abundant, and restrictions on imports have become even stricter. Therefore, last year's export volume was the smallest since 1917-18, and even lower than the pre-war average. The United States' sales to markets outside Europe were also poor. Even with China's large loan of American wheat, it did not help. The net import volume of Italy, Germany, and Japan also shrank. The United States could only accumulate this large amount of wheat. In terms of export volume, last year's American wheat and flour were the least since 1868-69.</p>
<p>Calculated in gold, the change in wheat prices has been on a new low average level, and in the past two years, the world's consumption of wheat as food has also greatly decreased, especially in the United States, Germany, Japan, and Italy. As a result, inventories have accumulated more and more, reaching a new high at the end of last year.</p>
<p>The following table is compiled by the International Institute of Agriculture, providing overall statistics on recent world wheat production, supply, and inventory, and an estimate of supply and demand for the year ending July 31, 1934 (millions of bushels) (each year is the year ending July 31 of that year).</p>
<p>World Production World Supply for Export World Demand Year-End Inventory of Exportable Wheat</p>
<p>Exporting Countries Importing Countries Total Soviet Share</p>
<p>1927 2,397 999 1,076 49 827 249</p>
<p>1928 2,534 1,077 1,128 3 809 319</p>
<p>1929 2,836 1,102 1,435 ··· 923 612</p>
<p>1930 2,230 1,223 1,130 10 628 602</p>
<p>1931 2,653 1,062 1,388 115 824 564</p>
<p>1932 2,543 1,129 1,387 64 799 588</p>
<p>1933 2,352 1,358 1,321 16 629 692</p>
<p>1934 2,055 1,400 1,105 30 525 580</p>
<p>Production excludes the Soviet Union, China, Persia, and Turkey. 1934 is an estimate.</p>
<p>Assuming that the above estimates of supply and demand for 1934 are accurate, then the number of wheat producers lacking in 1933-34 should be 112 million bushels. These insufficient quantities should be filled with stored wheat. Looking at the statistical figures, the wheat situation seems to have improved. However, if we look at the price of wheat in the year from December 1932 to December 1933, it has fallen sharply (unit: shillings per hundred pounds).</p>
<p>Year Average Price Year Average Price</p>
<p>1927 to 28 2.87 1933 to 34 1.06</p>
<p>1928 to 29 10.20 August 6.06</p>
<p>1929 to 30 9.98 September 5.74</p>
<p>1930 to 31 6.10 October 5.50</p>
<p>1931 to 32 5.76 November 5.10</p>
<p>1932 to 33 5.77 December 5.33</p>
<p>Regarding the production and wheat planting acreage (British acres) of various countries, according to the International Agricultural Association, the world's production (excluding the Soviet Union) and a small number of countries) seemed to be less than the previous year. There have also been huge changes in the distribution of production between 1932 and 1933. Europe's harvest set an unprecedented record. On one hand, the number of wheat planting acres increased, and on the other hand, the yield per acre also increased. The increase in European production is undoubtedly due to increased production efficiency, and not entirely due to suitable weather. On the other hand, harvests in North America have decreased in recent years, partly due to the reduction of wheat planting area, and partly due to the reduction in production per acre. Regarding the figures for the Soviet Union, although its acreage has gradually decreased, its output has increased significantly. However, the quality of wheat produced in the Soviet Union is relatively poor. In the Southern Hemisphere, Argentina's harvest was more saline than the previous year, but Australia's production was less than in 1932-33. The list is as follows (countries whose output was less than 15 million bushels in 1933-34 are not listed): Country Wheat Planting Area Production</p>

<h3>Finance Foreign Exchange Remains Sluggish | Minor Fluctuations in Minor Currencies |</h3>
<p>In recent days, the foreign exchange market, after reaching nine fen early last week, has steadily declined. Yesterday, it had shrunk to four fen. The morning and afternoon markets were the same, indicating that a financial market recovery is not easy. Yesterday's exchange transactions saw over 3.7 million in fund transfers in the morning market, over 200,000 in new transactions, over 300,000 in the afternoon market, and over 400,000 in transactions at the Small General Association. Due to the regular end-of-period holiday for banks, transactions were completely halted, making the market atmosphere even more subdued. Although money shops saw slight activity, they could not make a difference alone, and transactions were also weak. It is estimated that over 3.7 million was collected for foreign public bonds, over 300,000 in remittances from various regions, and over 400,000 in banknote withdrawals. The market prices of minor currencies saw slight changes compared to the 15th. The Jiangnan minor currency was 801 yuan in the morning market and 803.5 yuan in the afternoon market, slightly better by 0.5 yuan, with 5,000 jiao traded in the morning market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong minor currency was 732 yuan in the morning market and slightly rebounded by 4.3 yuan to 736.3 yuan in the afternoon market, but still down by 2.7 yuan compared to the 15th. 10,000 jiao was traded in the morning market and 50,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins rebounded by 3,000 cash, reaching 333,000 cash, with a transaction value of 13,500 yuan, totaling 44,955 strings of cash.</p>

<h3>Securities Bond Prices Soar Last Week | Fluctuating Forces Extremely Strong |</h3>
<p>Last week, from June 11th to 15th, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was only open for trading for five days, excluding Saturday, which was a summer holiday. During these five days, the market was extremely turbulent, completely affected by the temporary disappearance and subsequent recovery of Deputy Consul-General KuraMoto. Market prices also experienced significant fluctuations accordingly. The general sentiment among short sellers was that the situation would escalate further compared to the previous disappearance of Nakamura and Ishimoto, potentially leading to major negotiations. Panic spread, and short selling surged. However, as the reporter had previously stated, the matter was simple, and the Deputy Consul-General held a significant position and would not provoke reckless actions. Since KuraMoto was found on Wednesday, the short positions lost their basis and experienced a significant rebound. The magnitude of the changes and the speed of the reversals left short sellers scrambling. Given the substantial rise in market prices in the previous week, short sellers naturally believed it was a good time to profit. Without the KuraMoto incident, there might have been hope for a market correction, and a rapid rise might not have been possible. However, after this incident, floating long positions were avoided, while short positions increased sharply, leading to a more intense rebound than before. In addition, there were numerous arbitrage transactions in the financial market, with deliveries due this month. Well-capitalized silver companies also absorbed large amounts, causing market prices to soar and new high prices to emerge repeatedly. Gold short positions reached 73 yuan, and consolidated salt tax also reached over 68%, with 70% within reach. However, demobilization bonds underperformed significantly. The historical difference was over five yuan, but recently it was only over two yuan. In effect, gold short positions rose by three yuan. With further price increases, demobilization bonds are also expected to rebound. The general expectation is for gold short positions to reach 75 yuan and consolidated salt tax to reach 70%, which will soon be proven by facts. Last week, on Monday, KuraMoto disappeared, and the five, twenty, and thirty-eighth issues saw significant selling. Retail long positions emerged and sold off enthusiastically, causing market prices to drop by over 1.5 yuan. On Tuesday, there was a rebound of several jiao to one yuan. On Wednesday, the market was weak and lackluster. The news of KuraMoto being found triggered a major rebound, with prices surging by over one yuan. On Thursday, the market was somewhat chaotic, with more gains than losses, large investors buying, and retail investors selling. On Friday, the financial sector bought in large quantities, further driving up market prices. After gold short positions broke through the 72 yuan mark, they surged like a runaway horse, reaching a new high of 73 yuan. Consolidated salt tax and Full Six bonds also saw new high prices throughout the trading day. On Saturday, the market was closed for the summer holiday, with the upward trend remaining strong and the momentum still prevalent. Short selling is not yet the right strategy. As a result of the week's market performance, prices rose by several jiao to 1.3 yuan. The total transaction volume, including spot and futures, was 10,740,050 yuan. The high, low, rise, and fall results compared to the previous week are listed in the table below.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Stagnant but Strong</h3>
<p>New Fung Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (16th) the stock market rose again. This is because the steel industry strike has been decided to be extended, and with the Congress likely to adjourn soon, confidence on Wall Street has greatly improved. However, due to the expected decline in business during the summer and the anticipated drop in steel production next week, the general attitude remains cautious. Silver futures trading was dull as usual, with a half-day volume of 580,000 shares. The (securities) market is stagnant but strong, and prices are expected to continue to rise next week. The (grain) market was dragged down by corn. The news is favorable for long positions, and purchases are recommended when prices fall. Wheat harvests in Southern Europe are expected to decrease by approximately 100 million bushels compared to last year. Harvests in Germany and Czechoslovakia are also expected to be smaller. The condition of wheat crops in the prairie provinces of Canada is extremely serious, with grasshoppers plaguing Manitoba and Saskatchewan. (Cotton) opened higher due to the rise in Liverpool and the extension of the steel industry strike. However, the market weakened due to profit-taking by July long positions and increased supply. Sellers were cautious due to the possibility of a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico extending into cotton-producing areas. (Rubber) The market conditions in London and Singapore are strong, so New York also rebounded, expecting stricter restrictions to be imposed.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to favorable news from Liverpool, but then retreated due to sluggish spot demand. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, while futures prices rose by 2 or 3 points. English cotton futures rose by 6 or 7 points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to speculative selling, but then firmed due to Liverpool and European buying of July-August contracts and selling of April-May contracts next year. As a result, Pingal rose by 2 rupees, Oumra remained unchanged, and Bai Luo Xi rose by 1 rupee and 7.5 annas. Original telegram records are as follows: (Telegram on the 16th)</p>

<h3>Grains Late Rice Arrives, Retreats Half a Corner</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Due to a period of separation between sources of various gangs, there is an accumulation, with a total of over 80 houses (over 12,000 shi), with late rice accounting for one-third, and the rest being thick japonica and various colors. The market situation for late rice was gloomy from the start, and later, with the issue of rising shipping prices for Hakka to Tianjin, the intention to continue was even more subdued, and the market shape suddenly appeared tired and falling. Although sellers tried their best to persist, the result was that the facts could not be effectively reversed. For example, over 2,000 packages of Qingjiao, Songjiang, and Sijing goods were sold, and the price of higher-quality goods fell by half a chi, while lower-quality goods even reached a score of two corners. As for the thick japonica from various gangs in urban and rural stores, the sentiment after the festival was very good, and the market color was firm and elegant. However, the sudden sharp decline in the late rice market slightly affected it. At the close of the market, the prices of goods from Changbang, Suzhou, Tongli, and Nanhang were only slightly raised by a few points to nearly a corner. Du Yangjian ultimately faced many constraints from the downstream of Hakka, causing its shape to often appear soft and change subtly. The supply of goods was slightly scarce, and it has been able to turn stable.</p>

There were some transactions in Bukejian. The market was clearer, and the price of thin rice was tight by several points.

<h3>Investment in the Northwest</h3>
<p>— Cen Lou</p>
<p>Recently, the voice of developing the Northwest (has become increasingly loud). Since Mr. Song Ziwen returned from the Northwest, the development of the Northwest has become even more lively. Mr. Song has also persuaded Shanghai's banking circles to actively invest in the Northwest to open up another path for China. Shanghai's banking circles have accepted Mr. Song's opinion and are now working hard to prepare for investment in the Northwest. There are already six banks, including China Transportation Bank, joining this cause. This can be said to be good news for our country's development of the Northwest.</p>
<p>However, we cannot help but have a question. The development of the Northwest is indeed, in principle, beyond doubt. However, under China's current situation, can the development of the Northwest proceed smoothly? Also, how should the development of the Northwest be carried out? This also requires sufficient prior research.</p>
<p>The so-called Northwest, of course, refers to Shaanxi and the areas west and north of it. These places are still very desolate and backward. The development of the Northwest, of course, first requires large-scale development of mineral resources, cultivation of forests, and large-scale reclamation of wasteland. To do this, it is necessary to improve water conservancy</p>
<h3>I Stunnedly Held Her Hand</h3>
<p>— Guang Han</p>
<p>When one of my hands held one of her hands, how violently my heart was beating!</p>
<p>I must thank God for giving me such a good opportunity! At this time, the room was very quiet. Besides her and me, there was only a silently lying iron bed, a square table, and four round chair covers. There was no third person present. Even the amah had gone to the next room to do laundry. In fact, I didn't want to go to the movies today. Just having her and me together talking would bring me infinite comfort. I could do without anything else, or even if I did something, it couldn't arouse my interest. So, although I couldn't see the movie today, I felt immensely happy instead.</p>
<p>She seemed especially beautiful today. She was an innocent and lovely girl with big black eyes and a rhombus-shaped mouth, and she always spoke in a lively manner. She usually liked to chat with me in her spare time, after meals or before going to bed. She told me many interesting and miscellaneous things again today.</p>
<p>We have been together for several months, and unconsciously, there is already an extraordinary emotion between us. Especially for me, ah! I don't know why, but since the first time I met her, her image has been deeply imprinted in my heart. From that time on, we lived in the same house, seeing each other day and night, living a very happy life. Later, as we spent more time together, our feelings grew stronger. I couldn't calm down for even a moment without seeing her. But alas, I am a sentimental man, so even though the fire of love was burning in my heart, I always tried to put it out, not letting it blaze up. Because I was worried that if we were not careful, we would embark on the path of love, which would be extremely dangerous, and we would inevitably fall into a desperate situation from which we could not escape. However, can a uncontrollable fire of love allow you to suppress it? The more you try to extinguish it, the more fiercely it burns. I have suffered the most distress and pain I have ever experienced in my life!</p>
<p>Today, she and I were standing in our usual place, leaning our hands on the window, talking side by side. As we talked, we unknowingly talked for a long time. Looking at the setting sun on the horizon, it was covered with thin evening clouds, gradually sinking into the west. A gust of cool wind from outside the window stirred our hair, scattering it loosely in the air. We felt relaxed and continued to talk, almost unaware that night was approaching.</p>
<p>For four or five months, we have lived together, trusting each other, talking intimately like this, and today is not the first time. However, today, my heart felt somewhat different. I don't understand why it was different. I just felt uneasy and uncomfortable, my breathing was very rapid, and I felt like I was suffocating. I couldn't stand still, so I sat down on the chair behind me and rested my head on the window. At this time, the unspeakable pain I felt in my heart was so overwhelming that I couldn't help but burst into tears. But I didn't dare, I realized that I couldn't cry in front of her for no reason, so I tried my best to suppress it. When she saw that I was so sad, she stood close to me, and the moment her hand unintentionally touched my hand, a current of hot electricity suddenly flowed from her hand. So I couldn't resist such a strong stimulation, and finally forgot everything, stunnedly moving my hand to hold her hand, tightly. Thump, thump, thump, my heart beat. She also stood there in a daze, seemingly surprised, staring at me with her big black eyes.</p>
<p>Night enveloped the earth, and the room became even quieter. Two hands were still tightly clasped, silently, until darkness swallowed us up.</p>
<h3>Dismay</h3>
<p>— Yuan Zhi</p>
<p>The schedule for the graduation exams has already been posted on the school's bulletin board.</p>
<p>Seeing this, a difficult-to-describe emotion struck my heart. As if suddenly awakened from a dream, I realized that I was about to graduate.</p>
<p>Time is so fast, in every gap, it speeds away, silently and without a trace. How is it that I have been in this school for four years? To me, it still seems like yesterday, but the two huge, yet elusive words, "graduation," are reflected in front of me!</p>
<p>"Graduation," in the eyes of ordinary people, may be regarded as a glorious and joyous event. For oneself, it means that one has worked hard to complete several years of study and can use it to contribute to society and become a self-reliant person. From a social perspective, the country has spent a lot of financial resources to cultivate a group of talents, which is not easy. It is a joyous thing that they can serve society and benefit society in the future!</p>
<p>However, for me, I only feel disillusionment.</p>
<p>In the past, when I hadn't entered this school, I couldn't help but feel extremely envious and longed to come and enjoy this happiness myself. Later, I finally succeeded in fighting with my family, and I was able to stride into the gate of this university. The joy and pride in my heart were truly indescribable. However, soon, when you get used to the life here and actually taste the inner flavor, you find it plain and boring, and sometimes it even makes you feel another kind of dissatisfaction and regret.</p>
<p>In such an ordinary life, I, like the other students, have spent four years. In these four years, I was truly muddleheaded. Although I can't say that I was very wealthy and happy, I can't find any reasons or traces of suffering.</p>
<p>Now, it is the end of four long years. Future life depends on the decisions made at this moment. Whether it is happiness or suffering, it only takes a slight mistake. Now is the critical moment to summarize the past and plan for the future.</p>
<p>Because of this, I feel disillusioned, dismayed, and in pain. Several serious questions make me feel cold and frightened.</p>
<p>If I am lucky enough to graduate, where will I go afterwards? This is the most recent and most serious question for the future. Naturally, after graduation, I will look for a job. However, in this unstable society where there are more people than jobs, and more monks than porridge, it is not easy to find a suitable job. I don't have an uncle or aunt working as a manager or comprador in a foreign firm or factory, and I don't have an older sister who is a concubine of important people. What's the use of having a wealth of knowledge and hard fists?</p>
<p>Because of the above two questions, I am even more worried that I will really be unemployed. Then, not only will I fail my parents' hard work, but I will also be ridiculed by many people in society.</p>
<p>Ah! To whom can I tell my story? This inner conflict and pain. Should I blame myself for not working hard enough, or should I curse the defects of the social system!</p>
<h3>Firewood Boat</h3>
<p>— Jun Qi</p>
<p>The end was so gloomy and gray, like the face of a dead person!</p>
<p>With a drowsy head, I returned from watching the temple fair in XX Town. Walking to the railway bridge, I suddenly stopped instinctively. A peculiar incident caught my attention:</p>
<p>A guard in a yellow uniform stood near the river, a semi-new Mauser rifle slung crookedly on his shoulder, his eyes staring at the calm river surface, a hopeful smile hanging on the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>"Gudu, gudu," a boat full of rice straw came swaying from the other side of the bridge. A young man who looked like a farmer was rowing hard. His sallow, melancholic face clearly showed that he was worried about food!</p>
<p>The boat passed the bridge and approached the shore where the guard was standing.</p>
<p>"Hey, throw over two bundles of rice straw!" The guard said quietly to the person on the boat with a stern face.</p>
<p>"..." The young rower cleverly knew his intentions. A thought of resentment made him continue to row forward on his own.</p>
<p>"I'll give you money, I'll buy yours!" The guard said as he followed.</p>
<p>"......" The young rower ignored him.</p>
<p>"Row closer!... Did you hear?" The guard's soft words failed, so he changed to a tough tone to threaten.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>But the boat continued to row. In this way, the guard became really angry! Damn it, a person who is used to doing business has never suffered a loss, but today he ran into a snag! He picked up stones and threw them at the boat, ping pong ping pong, but the speed of rowing increased! Obviously, throwing stones was useless. So the guard picked up his gun, loaded it with bullets, and shot into the river next to the boat: with a bang, the woman and child on the boat cried: but the young man still refused to give in, and worked hard to row his firewood.</p>
<p>The boat passed!</p>
<p>When the guard turned back with a stern face, I realized the tragedy of "the powerful bullying the common people."</p>
<h3>The Choice Between Fish and Bear's Paw</h3>
<p>— Tian Hua</p>
<p>"Fish is what I desire, and bear's paw is also what I desire. If I cannot have both, I will give up the fish and take the bear's paw." Master Meng candidly expressed his wishes in this way, which is truly unparalleled in his straightforwardness. In today's world, from gentlemen and ladies to hawkers and peddlers, everyone competes to deal with the world with the attitude of diplomacy, trying to step on two boats with one foot, taking the fish on this side while not forgetting the bear's paw on the other side. They use their little cleverness to attempt to "have both."</p>
<p>The key skill of these people is that they are neither east nor west, neither left nor right, but stay in the middle, reaping the "fisherman's benefit." They may say good things on the east side, but they also say good things on the west side, often appearing in various occasions in this "well-rounded" fence-sitting posture.</p>
<p>Are these people really smart? Is "sitting on the fence" really a good "philosophy of life"? Is it really the most ideal life to waste one's life in a numb, mediocre, and opportunistic way, without any determination or effort to participate on one side, and wriggling without the passion for life?</p>
<p>The answer should be no. First of all, I want to point out that these smart people are mostly weaklings. A weak person rarely has the ability to make decisions. They have to split their personality into two, three, etc. in the contradictions of life. Whether it is big or small matters, it is difficult for them to carry through to the end; it is rare for them to be "one" person. Today they say this here, and tomorrow they may do something elsewhere that is completely inconsistent with what they said. Sometimes they may want to move forward, but there is an irresistible force pulling them back, and they also retreat willingly, not seeking progress.</p>
<p>They cannot be a (great man), and they can neither "leave a fragrance for a hundred generations" nor "be forgotten for ten thousand years." Their eyes only see fish and bear's paws, and whether they are great men is naturally out of the question.</p>
<p>A nation full of such people is an unenterprising nation, and a country composed of such a nation must be a country that does not make progress. However, our great Chinese nation is precisely this kind of unprogressive great collection. What to do? We are not willing to see our nation degenerate and our country perish, so we must find a way to sweep away these bad tendencies of "self-abandonment and self-deprecation" and "opportunism," and embark on the great future of rejuvenation. We must provide some solutions. A Western proverb says, "Make a decision, even if it is a bad one." This should be a good lesson. When fish and bear's paw are both desirable but cannot be obtained at the same time, this sentence should help us choose.</p>
<p>Also, the ancient foreign sage Socrates also said, "Do it, even if you do it in the worst way, it doesn't matter." Then, we should also do it, no matter whether the result of "doing" makes us a hero who "leaves a fragrance for a hundred generations" or a big bad guy who "leaves a stench for ten thousand years." From a new perspective, we should do it like a public servant does.</p>
<p>For the benefit of the nation and the success of individuals, we can no longer "sit on the fence" and be as indecisive as a weak person. We must be like a "great man," abandoning all opportunistic cleverness, and immediately decide whether to take the fish or the bear's paw as decisively as Master Meng!</p>

<h3>I Can't Endure It Anymore</h3>
<p>Dear Editor Gao:</p>
<p>This matter has been lurking in my mind for a long time, but I have always been unwilling to reveal it. Now, I can no longer endure it. I would like to ask you, sir, to spare a precious moment to give me some guidance. Six years ago, in early spring, due to a sudden change in my family environment and economic difficulties, my father and I planned the most important thing in my life, and soon I was engaged. At that time, I was still young and didn't know how to object at all, so I went along with it ignorantly without asking any questions. Now, my family has set the wedding date. At this moment, my bright and pure heart begins to tremble. May I ask you, sir, what methods can be used to resist not getting married? If I divorce her, what procedures are most appropriate? Will divorce harm her reputation? Do I need to pay any compensation? I heard that she will also raise the conditions for divorce with me. If she raises them, then do I need any compensation? I would be very grateful if you could carefully and immediately instruct me on all of the above. I am trembling here waiting for your good news, and I wish you good health, sir. Lu Renfu</p>
<p>Answer: I don't know if you are twenty years old yet. You are only considered an adult in law after you are over twenty. If your parents made the engagement on your behalf, you can only file for cancellation with the court after you become an adult. This is called cancellation, not divorce. Cancellation must go through legal procedures, you should ask a lawyer about this. As for whether it will damage her reputation, there are two ways of looking at it; people who are sensible will of course not say bad things about her, as for the old-fashioned people, it is difficult to say. However, in doing things in the world, one only seeks to be reasonable. It is very difficult to make everyone say good things. Others' improper criticism can be ignored. As for the layer of compensation, it depends on whether the other party has suffered losses due to the cancellation. If there are losses, of course it is necessary.</p>
<p>The above is the answer to your questions. Now that your family has chosen a wedding date for you, the first step you should take is to object to the marriage first, and then talk about cancellation. For example, if you are a minor, you should proceed in this way. As for how to object, there is no definite method, but marriage is your own business. If you are willing, if you are not willing, I ask, can the family lock you up to get married! Editor</p>

<h3>Chastity Memorial Arch (4)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>I don't know when, but around the stone memorial arch, there were already some children shouting. They also caught crickets, and they used all kinds of nasty words to scold people. In Shi Min's habits, these were all lowly children. They wore ragged pants, bare-chested and barefoot, with mud splattered on their backs and faces. An eternally indelible excitement hung on their faces. But where did they come from? It seemed like they didn't have homes at all. He didn't know them, he had never seen them, but they made Shi Min infinitely envious. Look, some of them were riding on the stone lions in front of the stone memorial arch, a total of two lions and two elephants. They were shouting and calling on them, so happy and unrestrained. An attraction drew Shi Min closer to them, looking at them and smiling, and he smiled unnaturally himself. The two stone lions, the one on the left was probably female, because there was a small lion at her feet, which was quite cute. The one on the right had a stone ball under his foot, and a small ball in his mouth. As long as you moved it with your finger, it could turn. The two elephants hanging on both sides of the lion couldn't tell their gender, and they both had long noses that dragged all the way to their feet. And they all had a vase on their backs, I don't know what it was for. But the cutest thing was still the round ball in the lion's mouth. Shi Min really wanted to play with it, but he was too short and couldn't reach it even if he stood on tiptoes. So he found a bamboo branch and inserted it into the lion's mouth. But a wild child snatched his bamboo branch for no reason, and roared so loudly that it almost made him cry. He didn't dare to resist, because he knew that he couldn't beat him. Fortunately, there was a bigger scabies child next to him, who grabbed that person's braid and scolded loudly:</p>
<p>"Little dog, are you bullying him? When his family finds out, tell your father, I'll always watch you."</p>
<p>Father wants to beat your ass."</p>
<p>"Who is he? Another child was asking scabies, scabies said:"</p>
<p>"Don't you know him? He is the grandson of Zhengfu Gonggong."</p>
<p>"Oh!" When the name of Zhengfu Gonggong was mentioned, who didn't know. He lived in the provincial capital all year round, and the provincial capital was hundreds of miles away from here. Hundreds of miles, how far away. If the dozen or so miles from Datian to the county seat were taken as a ratio, it would be too far. It is said that going to the provincial capital requires passing through Poyang Lake, and it takes more than a month to float across Poyang Lake by boat. Living in such a distant place already made people feel amazing, not to mention being an official there. So everyone felt like Zhengfu Gonggong was a god when they mentioned him. And now this fair-skinned little grandson is his child, so there is also an unspeakable feeling, at least it is very different from the children who touch the cow's ass.</p>

<h3>On Anti-Religion and Superstition Films</h3>
<p>— Wan You</p>
<p>Not long ago, I saw an article titled (The Current View of Chinese Films) in this publication, which moved me at the time. In that article, Mr. Yaqun made three demands on Chinese filmmakers. In addition to the production of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal films, he also made the urgent demand for anti-religion and superstition films.</p>
<p>Regarding the former, conclusions have been reached after repeated discussions, so I don't want to say more about it here, while the latter, the proposal of anti-religion and superstition, is indeed very fresh and worthy of discussion.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, in order to prove its urgent need at present, we may first take the opposite approach and make a factual reference. That is to say, we must first observe what position films promoting religion and superstition occupy in China today.</p>
<p>In any case, we must admit that films like Burning the Red Lotus Temple and similar films two years ago, although ostensibly produced as martial arts films, are in essence evil existences preaching religion and superstition. This is an undeniable fact. After the January 28th Incident, Chinese films began to take a new path, and that type of film seemed to have been rejected by progressive audiences and disappeared. However, in the difficult process, there was no way to completely eliminate those works for a while, so until now, films like (Kagungan), which promote the retribution of heaven, are still being produced continuously.</p>
<p>Of course, films that are entirely propaganda for religion may not be produced in China, because the authority of religion does not become the source of dominance. However, today is very different. It is said that a certain company has already filmed a newsreel promoting superstition. The reason is very simple. The current situation in China has shifted from long-term resistance to psychological resistance, or rather, resistance has been cancelled altogether, and there is nothing to talk about. Moreover, even if one does not resist oneself, one does not want others to resist either. Therefore, it is thought that if others are unwilling to die and want to struggle a little, it will inevitably be unfavorable to oneself. So morphine is poured down our throats. Unknowingly, you will die even if you don't want to. Under this policy, Living Buddhas and Immortals are greatly active, knocking on wooden fish and chanting Amitabha, the Buddha Tathagata, the Bodhisattva Guanshiyin, and even the famous lewd monk Guanxi Bodhisattva, also descend to the human world, showing great compassion and saving all beings; although they are slaves of a fallen country in this life, it is because they did too many evil deeds in their previous lives, and they deserve such evil retribution in this life, so being a slave of a fallen country is nothing, it is better to cultivate devoutly in the afterlife, even if it means destroying the family and losing the country. This phenomenon should be felt painfully by everyone with a little blood, right? Isn't it true that officials and scholars sell out the country for personal gain and demand that our common people all die? What kind of situation is this?</p>
<p>Therefore, since the facts are all there, I think all conscientious film artists who are unwilling to be slaves of a fallen country and unwilling to die should sensitively perceive this crisis and produce anti-religion and superstition films with their passion for saving the country and the people (which is naturally also saving themselves). In this regard, it is naturally necessary to emphasize the aspect of national destruction and racial extinction due to superstition. And more broadly, superstition that is absolutely contrary to science should also be rejected by scientific people. Moreover, we must know that religion and superstition are completely products of feudalism. The emperors of the Middle Ages often feared that the people would rebel and used religion and superstition as a universal anesthetic. This is a very obvious fact. Therefore, if we believe that our era will never go backwards to the Middle Ages, we must strike at this strange phenomenon that goes against the times.</p>
<p>Filmmakers, we demand accurate anti-religion and superstition films.</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3>Review of "Multi-Angle Love"</h3>
<p>— Dan Feng</p>
<p>WerenotDrssing| Cathay's "Multi-Angle Love" will give people a very slight and seemingly clear impression. I have said that artists are all smart people, and American film artists are especially extremely smart. For example, the playwright actually came up with a desert island in his ideal, and it was a young man and a young girl, singing and dancing, "fragrant grass like grass, fallen English colorful," so the ideal desert island almost turned into a fairy island.</p>
<p>Regarding this aspect, I think it is not necessary to emphasize anything about escaping reality or the poet's dream. Anyway, friends who are tired of watching movies will definitely be able to regain the feeling of boredom from this film. As for the components of happiness, naturally there are very few.</p>
<p>We have already learned enough about Pink Kobei's bass singing in many films. The so-called light and wonderful love song is his specialty. Sometimes it can make people intoxicated as if they have eaten a large amount of wine. However, this is only for those brothers and sisters who are in the sea of love, and on the other hand, if you want to find a kind of exciting stimulation in his singing, it will not be there. Soft, delicate and weak is his specialty, and it is also the specialty of multi-angle love.</p>
<p>Romance, nihilistic romance. Unfortunately, the fairyland in dreams is no longer longed for by active people!</p>
<h3>Review of "Fugitive Lovers"</h3>
<p>— Ke Chi</p>
<p>FugitiveLovets | Daguangming Although "Fugitive Lovers" also depicts a fugitive (like "The Fugitive"), "Fugitive Lovers" did not expose the dark side of capitalism as much as "The Fugitive," it's just a police chase and the trick of fugitives having romance in times of crisis.</p>
<p>The playwright of "Fugitive Lovers" wants the audience to sympathize with the fugitive Bode, and objectively tells the audience how fierce the police are and how the law deprives people of their freedom. Even the love between two people cannot but be forced to be dispersed due to the urgency of the pursuit. In the end, Bode rescued the child selflessly in the wind and snow, but he still could not avoid being arrested. This can very well ignite the audience's anger at the unjust law. However, unfortunately, the screenwriter came up with a contradictory explanation of the fairness of the law at the end of the Happyenjing, and the entire plot was destroyed.</p>
<p>Director RichardBoleslavcky's technique is very successful, and of course its success is mostly due to the screenwriter's use of Action to promote the plot; a series of stimuli touched the heartstrings of every audience.</p>
<p>The actors are best at Robert Mormon Gomory and Manqi Evans.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Writings on "Song of the Fishermen"</h3>
<p>— Yuan Zhi</p>
<p>The long-awaited "Song of the Fishermen" finally premiered at the Jincheng Cinema on the 14th.</p>
<p>The plot of "Song of the Fishermen" can be said to be very well structured. It encompasses various different aspects, all brought to the silver screen. It includes capitalists and landlords of the exploiting class, as well as fishermen and workers of the exploited class; the cunning and slyness of the rich, and the sympathy and mutual assistance of the poor. ... All in all, it can be said to sharply expose the intensification of capitalism and the bankruptcy of feudal rural areas in a concise and thorough manner.</p>
<p>The director's technique is very skillful. It also features title-bearing shots like other films, but here they are much more clever. Furthermore, the corresponding and coherent scenes before and after leave a deep impression on people. For example, Xue Qiyun draws a heart, and Liang Yuebo fills it with a $ sign; later, when the two steal He Renqi's property and flee, Xue Qiyun draws a $ on the newspaper to hint to Yuebo, who then adds a heart shape outside, these small details are deeply touching.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Wang Renmei, Tang Tianxiu, Shang Guanwu, etc., all perform very diligently. Although many people have deeply imprinted Han Langen as a comedian, and it is perhaps unavoidable that he comes across as frivolous in tragic moments, in terms of the character in the play, playing a madman is the most suitable role for him.</p>
<p>The actors' portrayal of the poor is extremely realistic, without the drawbacks of many previous films where the poor still had permed hair. "Remainder omitted."</p>
<h3>Reflections After Watching "Song of the Fishermen"</h3>
<p>— Han Chuan</p>
<p>The subject matter of this film and the author's ideas both have their unique aspects. The meticulousness of its arrangement, the suitability of the camera angles, and the beauty of the still life are indeed unmatched by other Chinese films. However, the main reason for the failure of the China-Foreign Fisheries Company is not attributed to the economic domination of imperialism, but to the general manager and a wealthy man's wife running away with the money. This kind of conceptual error will definitely have a great impact on misleading the audience, even if the playwright wants to expose a certain wealthy man's dimwittedness and his decadent lifestyle.</p>
<p>Although the overall performance uses the same techniques as "Morning in the Metropolis," it is much more advanced. Scenes like the little monkey talking to himself in the mirror, and the scenes of him picking up a kitchen knife to chop the old man can prove the director's painstaking efforts, and the little cat singing "Song of the Fishermen" three times in different environments under "first time exception" is even more poignant. Especially the last time.</p>
<p>The director is indeed very attentive to small techniques. For example, the general manager lighting a match for a wealthy man, the manager lighting a match for the general manager, and the staff lighting a match for the manager, these subtle details reveal the insincerity in the metropolis. As for the little cat being afraid that his brother would tell their mother directly that he had no work, so he hit the little monkey once, and finally tearfully asked, "Brother, does it hurt?" The feeling of remorse is very moving. Furthermore, several contrasts are also performed very emotionally. Several scenes of "swallowing knives" and "selling punches" fully reveal the problem of eating in the metropolis, where people risk their lives for money. However, the little monkey and his sister received relief from the wealthy man's son, which resulted in their uncle being injured, the siblings being falsely accused of theft, and their blind mother being burned to death, which, although increasing the audience's excitement a lot, is not so coincidental in reality. Finally, the little monkey dies due to malnutrition, which shows that Chinese wet nurses, due to their own living problems, cannot let their own sons live long, leaving the audience with great regret. "Remainder omitted."</p>
<h3>Reflections After Watching "The Rich Family"</h3>
<p>— Yun Dou</p>
<p>We, who are struggling under the iron hooves of imperialists, cannot help but doubt all the real suffering we endure, and unconsciously a sense of resistance arises || The crystallization of this consciousness is the birth of a certain "-ism." As for the implementation of any "-ism," that is another question.</p>
<p>Our sinking country certainly does not need those narcotics that forget the present, but must seek an "exhortation that can revitalize," constantly reminding us of the awakening of that sense of resistance.</p>
<p>If we observe according to "history," then the present of the 20th century is the complete inheritor of the past of the 19th century. Due to the development of capital production and the enlightenment of scientific culture in the previous century, the feudal system and monarchical politics have to decline entirely. Therefore, by observing the discarded shells of the era, we can also understand all the cause-and-effect relationships in the transition. When we reason carefully, we cannot avoid that big pile of old tunes: geographical exploration, scientific invention, industrial revolution, the decline of the rural economy, radical international trade, the manipulation of financial exchange, the collapse of aristocratic politics, the rise of capitalism, and the concentration of population in machinery, the expansion of production, the lack of raw materials, the conquest of colonies | the tail end of production capital |, the competition of the international market, even population surplus, production surplus, capital surplus, and finally the great panic unprecedented in world economic history. At the same time, various countries are bustlingly preparing for the next massacre, as if there is no way out for the world except war, 1935 is good, and 1936 is even better.</p>
<p>No one can deny these iron-like facts, and the film "The Rich Family" explains them completely, truly worthy of being the champion of 1934. It tells us that in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, the winner was not the Duke of Wellington, and the loser was not Napoleon, but it was a matter of life and death between the monarchical rule and the power of capital fighting each other. Finally, capitalism, establishing a business and passing it on for generations, has become the Taizu Gao Emperor of modern civilization. It also tells us what the relationship between people is like: abuse and killing come from nature, and what the strong expect from the weak is absolutely not the same dignified life. It also tells us that equality is limited to rights and classes, "privileged" and "unequal" not only belong to the issue of "color."</p>
<p>Although the implicit consciousness of the whole play is so serious, the performance is so vivid and full of interest. Georgia Ellis is indeed an indisputable genius elder, and the director's brilliant skill is also admirable. In the last scene, the harmony of colors can be called the supreme achievement of film art. Added to this is Disney's "The Grasshopper and the Ants" technicolor short film, which makes people even more sentimental and deeply thoughtful. This film is indeed a rare masterpiece of this year, so it should not only receive the highest evaluation, but also occupy a great position in our thoughts.</p>
<h3>Brief Review of "Three Sisters"</h3>
<p>— Bao Sheng</p>
<p>"Three Sisters" is a collaboration of several new and old actors. Now let me briefly review it!</p>
<p>This work is a depiction of the tortuous romance of three sisters, and narrates how a love swindler who kills three birds with one stone finally suffers an embarrassing revenge. It gives a strong attack on lovers who believe in love above all else and men who play with women, and gives a considerable correction to the young men and women in today's society who are blindly infatuated with love.</p>
<p>The photography of this film is clear, and the angle is quite accurate. The roles played by actors such as Yan Yuexian, Hu Die, Sun Min, etc., also fit their personalities, so they can fully express themselves. In addition, the expressions and actions of the three new actors, Zhao Dan, Lin Li, and Zhong Yi, are also very beautiful and appropriate.</p>
<p>In short, "Three Sisters" is a work that has achieved considerable success, and is a compass for young men and women who are confused in love!</p>
<h3>Liu Liying's Sudden Illness Stuns Two People</h3>
<p>The Lianhua No. 2 Factory's satirical comedy "Wine, Sex, Wealth, and Temper," which gathers a great collection of comedic talent, has been 70% completed since its production began. However, unexpectedly, when there were only five or six days of filming left, the female lead, Liu Liying, suddenly fell ill, causing the work to be suspended for several days. Director Tan Youliu was of course extremely anxious, but Gao William and Liu Jiqun were even more anxious than the director. Because Gao had to take a boat back to Guangdong in early June at the latest to celebrate his father's birthday, if the female lead's illness healed, work could begin immediately, so even though they were eager to return home, they could not leave. Fortunately, one day Liu Liying was able to come to the factory despite her illness, so the great self-built interior T-shaped road was filmed in one go that day. Old Liu immediately rushed to catch the train, and Gao, packed his luggage overnight and left Shanghai early the next morning.</p>

<h3>Till the Seas Run Dry and the Stones Decay "Registered Nurse" "Nine"</h3>
<p>— Xie Hua</p>
<p>The latest developments are being carried out secretly. So everyone knew that Peng Deng was a married woman, and a new patient in the mental hospital was Peng Deng's husband. Peng, on the other hand, used her busy work to dispel the sorrow in her heart. She met Frank in the large corridor. Yesterday she was still joking with him, telling him to pay attention to the road signs, but today she walked past with her head down, not even seeing his wheelchair rushing towards her. Frank frowned, somewhat puzzled. But he noticed that her face was covered with a layer of sorrow, and that something unfortunate must have happened to her. He couldn't help but shake his head and sigh, thinking how such a beautiful girl could endure so much suffering... Ethel was carrying a food tray and happened to walk over. She stopped in front of Frank, and together with Frank, watched Peng Deng's retreating figure, until she slowly turned the corner and disappeared. Ethel sighed and said, "Poor Peng, her luck is really bad." Frank continued, "It's really bad luck. When is that James Peng Deng having surgery?" Ethel said, "Probably in about an hour." After she finished speaking, she walked away with the tray.</p>
<p>After Ethel left, Frank was left alone in the hallway. He frowned, thinking deeply for a long time. Suddenly, he made a firm decision, and pushed his wheelchair to a ward in a hurry. He entered the ward and saw James Peng Deng lying on the bed, looking out the window. Peng Deng had just been here, and he had said a thousand apologies to her. He knew the suffering she had endured in the past few years, but Dr. Hightway said it was okay, that he would be cured, but he was very afraid, not knowing when the darkness in his mind would return... Peng Deng had only left for a minute or two when Frank suddenly barged in. He opened his mouth and asked, "I came to see you, is that okay? You and I have the same nurse, that nurse is really good." James said indifferently, "Well, not bad." Frank pushed his wheelchair to James' bed, and told James in a low voice, "That girl should enjoy some happiness, but people can't control fate, it's really too pitiful | You know, her man is too useless, have you heard?" James lay quietly, listening to him continue, "It's really too unfortunate. She doesn't love her man, you know. He's a pair of old shoes, soon to be thrown away, because sooner or later she will divorce him. But she hasn't thought about it yet, she's not willing to do it yet. It's a mess, don't you think?" James silently agreed, "Too bad." Frank continued to talk endlessly, "You only know one thing, but not the other. You know, she has fallen in love with someone else | still a doctor here. He's a very good person, but it makes the nurse even more difficult, it's getting worse and worse, don't you think?" James listened and said, "I didn't know that." Frank pretended to be completely casual and said, "That's absolutely true. They are very much in love. Are you staying here permanently?" He asked again. James' eyes looked out the window again, counting all the scenery of the city. He slowly said after a while, "I'm afraid not..." Frank, hearing these words, pushed his wheelchair back out with both hands. He felt that he had done his duty. The person sleeping in the bed was not completely mindless, he felt.
