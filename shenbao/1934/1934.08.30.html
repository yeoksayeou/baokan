<p>近來報紙上載着一段消息說。「據政府某機關調查。全國水旱兩災損失。總數已逾十萬萬元。受影響者幾及全國三分之二。計旱災十四省。爲縣三百四十三。水災十三省。爲縣十二。此外尚有受蝗患者六十八縣。受雹災者八十九縣。」以這樣廣大的災區。如此嚴重的物資和人力上的損失。似乎對於今後國民經濟發展的前途。是必然的要發生一種根本上的變化了。在這樣情形之下。目前最重要的工作。就是如何從事於救濟。說到救濟。便成爲政府方面一個絶大的財政問題。而况全國農村在這樣嚴重災情之後。對於財政上所發生的影響。亦是可想而知的。我們且先把這種影響。分析一下。第一。嚴重的災情之後。最受影響的。當然是地方財政。從國民政府成立以來。向屬中央正供的田賦收入。已改爲地方政府的重要財源。於是養成了地方財政和田賦正附收入間的密切關係。就一般情形說。各省田賦正附收入。約佔到全部收入百分之七十。乃至百分之九十。水旱災發生以後。直接受害的是繳納田賦的鄕村。所以對於地方財政方面。是一個絶大的打擊。平時。我國的地方財政。本來就非常紊亂。主要的原因。自然是由於地方當局的濫用無度。單就民國十六年以後說。各地金融機關。對於地方政府所供給的資金總額。已不下三萬萬元。但是這樣的一大筆資金。大都給地方當局完全浪費了。今年的水旱災。旣然有廣被全國三分之二的事實。一方面地方政府不但喪失了主要的財源。就要想各地金融機關。繼續作財政上的援助。恐亦不免於失望。單就江浙的情形看來。江蘇雖有發行三千萬元公債的傳說。浙江且已由中央核准發行公債二千萬元。並且有就上海發行之議。以目前國内商業金融的困難。上海一市有無承受的力量。尚是一個疑問。</p>
<p>第二。便是水旱災對於中央財政的影響。誰都知道中央財政的主要收入。是關鹽統稅三種。因爲這三種收入。旣是中央經常的歲入。又有擔保内外債的關係在内。所以受人們十分的重視。不過大家知道。這三種收入。亦都和農村的生産狀態。息息相關的。就關稅收入說。今年前七個月的收入。已較去年减少了三萬萬元左右。以後恐怕更要减縮了。</p>
<p>由上面兩點的說明。我們不能不承認目前的財政已瀕於十分嚴重的地步。但最足使人不取樂觀的現象。還不在這些地方。而在主们下列的兩點。第一。上海是全國的金融中心。但任何商人抱着「將本求利」的目的。對於收入没有擔保的投資。始終存着漠視心理。在全國閙着水旱大災的當兒。上海的米麵糧食。便成了良好的投資對象。救濟天災的公債儘管集議。而不易實現。第二。政府對於目前的水旱災。所以始終還没有很好的辦法。財政困難。自然是根本的原因。而財政困難的一個主要原因。又在於國際的重大壓迫。在國際恐慌加速度發展的今日。洋銀行視爲機會。固屬可懼。華銀行受人壓迫。對於金融信用的戒備。更不得不格外嚴密。因此爲救濟水旱災而援助政府的說法。亦更爲困難了。</p>
<p>所以我們以爲在水旱交迫之下。如果要爲中國的財政和金融找尋出路。</p>
<p>只有先把這兩種難關打破了。才有可能。否則。都不過是「隔靴搔瀁」罷了。</p>

<p>申時社云、江蘇省政府爲發展水利、及整理新舊債務、决定發行公債三千萬、前已擬具辦法、及各項細則、呈請中央核准、中央初以蘇省連年災祲、市面凋敝、民困未紓、對於此項公債債額、擬改爲一千萬元、而蘇省府則以所定計劃、均屬急待施行、不能再行减少、故復派財民二廳長赴京陳說、結果以折中辦法、决准發行二千萬元、業於昨日由中央政治會議正式通過、俟移交行政院通過後、卽可轉令蘇省府發行、</p>

<p>｜｜答張一雁君</p>
<p>在不久以前，本欄登過一篇討論「私生活與理想」的文字，那篇東西又是田於另兩篇文字所引起的，一篇是「論生活的予盾」，一篇是「釋實踐」。張君道封來信是讀了「私生活與理想」，對於自己的私生活作了一番檢查以後，所生出來的許多懷疑。張君認爲這是「有不少的人患着的一種通病」，是他「始終不能克服的，像波浪起伏的靑年的煩悶」。關於這一點，我們也早已見到。</p>
<p>張君對於「私生活與理想」那篇東西的重要點，好像還没有眞的把握到。那篇東西，是前面舉出的兩篇東西的繼續，我們着重的只在私生活要與理想相一致的那一點上。因爲我們常常看見一個人的理想甚是高明，而私生活至不堪問，徒有理想，而終不能實現。所以我們特别提出這點答發蕭羅二君。至於如何去逹到呢？我們所能提示的只能是原則，與方法，不能開出這一過程中詳細的細目。因爲這是不可能的。各人有各人的生活實踐與各人的理想、你何能替人代謀呢？張君認「奮鬥」兩字「未免太不能使人了解」，「懷疑到奮鬥兩字不過是安慰詞，正像用一塊糖塞在號哭的小孩的嘴裏」這完全是尚未了解科學的處理自己生活的方法。關於「私生活與理想二文中，我們是故意略去了這」部分的，因爲我們已在「論生活的矛盾」矺釋實踐」二文中已多少說過一點了。張君或許未曾翻過那兩篇短文罷！</p>
<p>以下我們進而與張君討論張君所提出的三個問題，第一是性的，第二是生活的出路，第三是刺激。張君把這三個問題看做是「造成靑年們最大的煩悶一，一阻礙他的前進，消滅了他的意志」這，老實說一句，我們不能完全同意。</p>
<p>我們以爲一個有正確的宇宙觀，社會觀和人生觀的靑年，他旣有了正確的理想，他的私生活當會漸漸的與他的理想，一天天相接近，决不會相違過遠。他祗要了解生活本身的矛盾性，他不會把生活看成固定的，靜止的狀態。他不會畏懼生活的矛盾現象，屈伏在與理想相左的矛盾之前，他也不會故意隱藏自己生活中的矛盾，怕别人窺見。一個不廻避實踐的人，他有迎面一切苦難的毅力，他對於自己的私生活的鬥爭，是很認眞的，不肯放鬆一點的。像張君提出的三個問題，第一個在靑年的私生活中，的確佔有較重要的地位。但也不如張君所說之甚，大致性的苦悶而至於終日「發痴」「乏味，也不過是幾個小所有的社會層的分子，還不是一般的大衆。但這决不就是否認靑年的性的要求。靑年對於性的要求是很平常的事。我們以爲，一個實踐的人，自然可以按照各人的生活狀况去解决。一切問題都祗有在實踐中才能解决。但不要把這問題過於誇大，張君遇着性的渴求時，「就悶坐一天」，這因爲張君的生活還是較優閑的緣故，所以其解决的方法，也是優閑的。不過，張君並未解决問題，性的高潮時來時去，便要在是採「悶坐一天」，請問這種生活還是人過的嗎。我們對於這一問題如果要談到勉强的解决，也如下面要談的生活問題的一樣，在這「死亡中」我們主張將就的解决，即對於能結婚時、對於對象方面不要要求過高，把性的問題弄得簡單些，不能結婚時，就用工作，勞動，等去减少它的襲擊，不是「悶坐。因爲性的問題到底比食是次要，没有老婆是不會餓死的。自然，這也不是問題眞的解决這一問題是一社會問題不是個人單獨可能獲得澈底的解决的。一個有理想的靑年，不會在這些問題上去煩悶，自戕自己的意志，因爲他知道這完全是無用。並且如果把這一種生活的矛盾誇張得太厲害。你雖雖　「不敢墮落」其實，日處在「煩惱」中，旣不能前進，又何異墮落呢？（未完）</p>

<p>第一回　鬼載一車關中來遠客家徒四壁渡口吊秦人</p>
<p>張介夫道：其實我們並不怎樣年老，只要找得着好一點的事呢，弄一二年就走，吃點苦，也算不了什麽。李士廉没有什麽話說，却歎了一口氣。在他兩人異常委屈的情形之下，車子便開到了西安城下。照規矩城門口有一番檢查，然後放行，張李二人，都是初次到西安的，進門之後，立刻就注意起來。這裏所最最容易感到和東方不同的，便是一切都是淡黄色。人家的牆，都是黄土築的，絶對不塗一點顔色。街道上的土，並不像東方那樣漆黑，也帶點灰黄。便是人家屋頂上的瓦，似乎也有些黄，那大概是浮塵吹在上面，掩蓋着一層黄色了。汽車在這樣的大街上，轉了兩個灣，奔上一條大街。這街道雖也有七八丈寛，但完全是土路。有幾處帶木板樓的店面，也七歪八倒。大部分店家，還是四五十年前，東方鄕鎭上的老樣子，有的在門口支着一方木攤，有的在屋檐下掛幾串紙繐子，有的在門口掛幾方藍布牌子，中間貼了紅字條。他二人正賞玩着，汽車已是停住。抬頭看時，路旁一堵土庫高墻，門下有個一字門框，在門上横了一方匾額，大書三個字，小西天。看那門裏面，左邊一個柜台，右邊木壁上，掛了一方大水牌，是旅客題名之處看這情形，頗有些像揚子江内地的小客棧。因問王老五道：這就是西安城裏最好的旅館嗎？王老五道：你要找比這便宜些的旅館，那也很多，你呌輛洋車把你拉去好了。張介夫道：比這還要小的旅館，那我們怎樣住？好，也就住在小西天罷。（八）</p>

<p>表弟來考Ｘ中學，考的那一天，要我送他去。</p>
<p>晨曦初上，兩輛東洋車拉到校門，走進去，操塲，走廊，隙地，已經有了不少的考相公。</p>
<p>這許多考相公，大部是從内地農村裏來的，所以西其裝而洋其服的很少，革其履的也不能超過三分之一，但是總有一件長衫，質料有杭綢，官紗，夏布，紗羅等幾種，華絲紗却没有看見。</p>
<p>在這許多年靑的考相公裏面，夾雜着不少四五十歲以上的老頭子，靑布鞋子，白布襪子，一身夏布短褂褲，也是白的，有幾個頭上戴着黑了的舊草帽，有幾個身上着了補過的夏布長衫，還有幾個眼睛上有一副銅邊眼睛，也有幾個是不着布襪而着洋襪的，這大概是新買的。據說：這都是考相公的父親老相公。時間還早，大家都在踱着，面孔上很是幽默。在葡萄架的一邊，聽見一個考相公和一個老相公在談話：</p>
<p>「………這次還是你的母親肯把一點金飾交換，否則你只好到你舅父店裏帮帮忙了；倘若時勢還不轉變，將來就不能想下去了。………我也不希望你怎樣，只想你和東村春平一樣，畢了業在上海做事，每月有幾塊錢寄給我。……」</p>
<p>因爲有事要回來，不能再聽下去，在歸途中想道：「恐怕一年以後，這幾位考相公穿了西裝回來，連老相公也要認不得了。」</p>

<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>南京已吹遍了海風，只有城南還有些古色古香，我想嘗一點「南京味」，便有人提起着明朝飯店。</p>
<p>明朝飯店在中華門外雨花路，號「馬祥興」，是十足的淸眞敎門館。他的模樣兒和蘇州的「荒飯店」方弗，進門就是爐灶，裏面有圍着桌子很安詳地喝茶，或者喝高粱的；但是慕名而來的，總是以吃點心爲原則的。麵，餕子，鍋貼，都是以牛肉爲主要成分，他的妙處，就是火功到家，湯是用鷄汁攙和的，尤其是牛筋，者得十分的爛，到口便化，不費咀嚼，這是所以馳名久遠的一點。據老吃客說，還有一味「燴什麽」，（我已忘記這特别名詞了」把牛的頷下一部分，煮成又脆又嫩的一種異味，這天還說没有，可惜不能一嘗。</p>
<p>爲了生意好，在左邊開闢了兩間雅座，（？）立法院長孫哲生氏常來光顧的。今年褚民誼提倡放紙鳶，雨花臺頓時熱閙得人山人海，便有許多來嘗「明朝味」，把明朝飯店擠得不可開交，甚至自己動手，到砧上去搶五香牛肉來吃的。</p>
<p>還有一點「可以表示他們能够保持中國的古代風趣，無論什麽東西，都是用「錢碼」的。我們到奇芳閣去吃一碗淸茶，給五六個銅子小賬，也會使堂倌不滿意的。可是馬祥興的夥計，便不計較這些，多給一點小賬，他們就滿臉堆着笑，把身子彎得像蝦一般的謝我們了。</p>
<p>有人說，這店並非創始於明朝，不過是現在的主人的曾祖所創始，大約一百多年的歷史。但是詩翁陳石遺已上過了當，認爲是眞的明朝飯店，那麽我們何必過分認眞，費什麽考據功夫呢！</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>不料慶善的主張雖想使太后到了天津再安歇，可是太后竟不能領受他的厚意，車子行到中途上，伊就聲明要安歇了。其時，慶善當然不敢再進什麽忠諫，列車便馬上停下來了。這裏，不但不是慶善所理想的大都市，且也不在什麽小村鎭上，簡直是在一片遼闊無人的荒野裏，但太后是絶對不曾注意及此，只催促那些太監和宮女，忙着把伊的衾枕摺放妥貼，便悄悄地睡去了。</p>
<p>我們這一列車上居然也有電燈的設備。太后對于别的新思想或新器具，大都没有什麽好感，唯有對于電燈，伊却是特别的歡喜。在宮中，在頤和園裏，都各有一座發電機裝着；因此，伊對于電燈的設備，已看做一樁日常生活上所必要的條件了。</p>
<p>太后已經安歇的消息，立刻便從我們這一列車的突然停止，而給予在後面護從着的那列兵車以相當的驚覺；于是他們的車子也停下來了，相距約二三十丈遠近，絶無聲息停着。幾百名頂盔貫甲，武裝齊全的御林軍，便悄悄地從車子上爬下來，開始負起了他們的禁衛的責任。這一列黄色列車的四周，霎時便佈滿了憧憧來往的黑影，和閃閃的刀光。尤其在光緖所乘坐的那一輛車的左右，禁衛得格外森嚴；與其說這樣特别的戒備，是爲着要保護光緖，還不如說爲着要防守他的比較確當一些。光緖的處境之苦，眞比任何一個平民都不如，使我不能不一而再，再而三的指明出來。（一一七）</p>

<p>— （梅雪）</p>
<p>自從各項表册上面註有性别一格、誰男誰女，當然辦别的很淸楚了。但是近來各大學發表的新生榜，大抵是男女兼取的，究竟所取的新生中，若干人是男生，若干人是女生，外界不能一目了然，這是表示性别上的一種缺點。</p>
<p>有人說：「女子的署名，多少總帶些脂粉氣，榜上不必註明性别，而人自了然。」這話也不正確，近來女生的取名，漸趨重於男子化，單就姓名上注意，决不能看出是男是女，小子以爲女子署名，如在姓名下自稱女士，似乎有些自誇，不能寫上試卷，但不妨在姓的下面，加着一個氏字，旣有了這個標識，那麽是男是女，便可一望而知了。有氏的是女，無氏的是男，各種表册上據此列表，正不必添註着性别一項，各大學發榜時據此列榜，則孰男孰女，早已朗若列眉，事很簡易，何不採取小子的一些小貢獻？</p>
<p>再者，女子姓下添氏，旣不乖於古訓，又没有自稱女士的誇大性，「不亢不卑」，道也是女界值得采用的。</p>

<p>— 穡秋</p>
<p>火車到了Ｓ市，再換乘小汽油船，在葉子拍拍轉動的聲中，便離開碼頭，向着故鄕的前途邁進。</p>
<p>春夏之交，河水方漲碧油油的多麽柔軟！河裏的船隻像梭子一般穿來穿去，兩岸平疇遠綠，直接天際，隱隱還見遥山一抹，伸入雲中。「呀多美麗的自然喲！」我不期從艙中走出來，立在船頭，深深的吸了一口新鮮空氣。</p>
<p>鎭日在都市塵囂中，給惡濁的空氣，薰得頭昏腦脹，簡直一刻没有淸靜，這種風景，三年没有見到了，心裏眞有些說不出的歡喜。小小的汽油船，背後還拖了一條很大的航船，速率是不能怏了，一路慢慢的駛去，低頭下視，河裏的水，淸可見底，時有無數魚兒，在水裏遊來遊去，好不逍遥自在，它没有侵略人家的野心，人家也不去侵犯它，它只是悠悠忽忽地過着快樂的一世。</p>
<p>從兩岸人語聲中，知道離故卿漸漸近了，心頭甜酸苦辣，感着什麽滋味，連自己也不知道。不多一會，我夢想多時的故鄕，果然湧現在眼前，來接我的人，也在岸上招呼了。這時太陽漸漸地下去，只見遠處一抹紅霞，飛上天半，像血一般照着田野，船裏的客人，一個個從船艙裏走出來向岸上去，我也提了東西，走上岸來，和家裏派來接的人慢慢的行去，在田野裏轉了幾個灣，便到Ｘ鎭上。</p>
<p>這一個小小的市鎭，街道狹得幾乎像上海租界裏的闊弄堂那麽寛，路面是一半泥土，一半石子，而且高低不一，如果天一下雨，那就泥濘得不能行走。街的一面是臨水，河身雖小，但兩岸種着很多的楊柳，一絲絲的，不住地在風中搔首弄姿，迎送着過往的扁舟。一面便是店舖，看去到一連有幾十間門面，他們陳列着各種不同的貨品，在那裏待價而沽，其中有糧食店，有洋貨店，也有具體而微的百貨商店。……這許多商舖，都是面對着小河，街上的行人，除掉早上小菜市稍爲多一點外，長日靜悄悄地行人很稀，店中職員們，一天到晚坐在櫃裏邊，旣不像上海商店裏有無線電可聽，又没有摩登小姐光臨，日長無事，祗有呆望着對面樹陰裏來來去去的小舟，耳聽着柔櫓欵乃的聲調，其實這種境界，是不容易得到的，而他們却已够厭倦，終日在夢想着上海的繁華。</p>
<p>「這是從上海回來的。他們每一個眼眶裏，表現出豔羨上海人的心理。從一條弄裏穿過去，後面便是我們的故園了。此時母親和我女兒，以及其他鄕親，都笑着走出來，問我爲什麽來得這樣遲？母親說：「墳地已經築好，虧得我們先回來十幾天，把一切都佈置得很舒齊。在殯房中安放已久的你們祖父祖母的靈柩，昨天已運到墳上，安葬的日子，就是後天下午，你妻子的一具，剛才方從上海運下來，大槪航船搖得太慢，躭擱了這許多天，現在暫放在殯房中，你旣下來了，也得去望望伊纔是。」</p>
<p>我一陣心酸，說不出話來，迷迷糊糊跟着引導的人，在斜陽欲盡的田野裏，一躄一躄的走去，幾百步外，前面的殯房。已望得見了。此時心裏滿貯着酸楚的我，只低倒了頭，隨着前面的人走去，走到幾間平房門首，看守殯房的人，將門打開，笑指着正中放着的一具。……天哪！那不是我妻長眠在裏邊的軀殼嗎？這時，三年前的幻影，不覺都跳躍到眼前來了，眼睛前一陣昏花，耳朶裏亂鳴不已，妻啊！不知你知道我近來更飽受了人世的滋味嗎？我雙手捧着心，涙珠再也忍不住了。</p>

<p>天天報紙上登的新聞，總是外貨傾銷，入超銳進；最近白銀約大量出口，和現銀的存底日枯，衆口一辭，都說吃盡外貨暢銷的痛苦，國貨工廠，到這個地步，苟非麻木不仁，或是喪心病狂，决没有自相殘殺，同室操戈的情形了。可是事業竟不如此，竟有許多工廠，忘了大敵當前，楚歐四面的情境，還在那裏拚命厮殺，拚命戰鬥，不是破壞業規，跌價競賣，便是粗製濫造，任意殺價。同業公會，旣無法制裁；善意勸告，亦充耳不聞。如瘋犬，如癲狂，充其極，不過損人不利己，嫉忌他人，結果是同歸於盡，徒爲洋商造機會。古人謂作事無爲親者所痛，而爲仇者所快。目下同業中有如此情形，無論爲同業，爲同胞，聞此消息，眞是十分痛心。然而鄰居的仇人，天天稱慶，時時拊掌，惟恐我們不是如此，任何業中，如果有些血心，有些天良，有些眼光，决不逕情直往，自趨末路。有之不但爲同業中之罪魁，之敗類，之禍首，推其用心，不使國貨絶跡不止，是眞賣國賊，是眞社會之蠹，是眞亡國滅種之奸商。不嬰人禍，必受天誅，然而社會總有公道，商塲自有是非，爲今之計；</p>
<p>（一）同業公會，應有組織有力量，凡同業中有此情形，當予以嚴厲之制裁，同業間不與往來，金融界斷絶關係，迸之業外，不與同中國。</p>
<p>（二）同業公會，應訂定價目及貨品成色，如果發現跌價或貨物粗製濫造情形時，立刻揭發公告全國。</p>

<p>最近上海國貨團體，見到這種的險象，提議設立各業統制委員會，制止跌價競賣，以維市面。這種見解，於國貨救國上很有貢獻，吾想各業中不乏深明大義之士，到此地位興亡繫於一着，惟有同業聨合，一致合作，萬萬不可以隨隨便便了。</p>

<p>— 競存</p>
<p>「討飯不可併排行」這是一句很普通的俗語，我願意將這一句話，貢獻於有志創辦國貨工廠的人們。</p>
<p>在今日要創辦國貨工廠，我們不要忘却了一個當前的勁敵，就是外貨的傾銷，在抵禦外侮的時候，我們要注意到不可再生内閧。如果外侮未去，内閧又生，那麽，全軍覆滅，是意中事，這一個很簡單的道理，是任何人都知道的，然而利令智昏，常常有許多人忘却這一點而受到慘敗。</p>
<p>有人說，我國人是富於模仿性而缺乏創造性，這句話似乎有些實在性，看見别人開辦調味品廠而獲利，於是我也開辦調味品廠，你也開辦調味品廠，他也開辦調味品廠，調味品充塞了市塲，結果就减價競爭，將來就同歸於盡，橡膠業，搪瓷業，熱水瓶業，以及新興的電木業，都有這一種趨勢，如果將這分散的力量，集中起來，任何勁敵都可以打破，可是大家不這樣想，各自爲政，甚至還要互相競爭，以减少對外的力量。這不是自掘墳墓是做甚麽，有人說，國貨生産事業能够有競爭比較纔能够有進步，這句話我不否認，不過競爭比較的對象最好是用外貨，和本國國産比較競爭，不算是好漢，正和勇於内戰怯於對外的軍閥，同樣的令人齒冷。</p>
<p>如果我要辦國貨工廠，我一定要選擇國人所没有注意到的事業去做，或許我的經騐，學識，資力，人才適合於辦某種國貨工廠，而這種工廠已經有人在辦了，我就將我的經騐，學識，資力，人才完全貢獻給他，參加工作，以增加他的生産能力，加强他的對外能力，謹記着「討飯不可併排行，」更須要認淸敵人，不要自相殘殺。</p>

<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>誰都知道，我們中華民國，到現在眞是到了一個十分嚴重的國難時期了！這所以造成國難的原因，固然很多，可是大多數的國民，不肯服用國貨，專門做洋貨的推銷員，以致國内金錢，滾滾外流，造成外人肥而國人瘦的狀態，這恐怕也是一個很大的原因吧！所以我們要解救國難，使中國能獨立自由，生存於世界，當然要從各方面加以努力，可，是提倡國貨，却也解救國難的方案之，一這是我可以斷言的。</p>
<p>不過，我們中國的國貨運動，提倡到現在，已有不少的年頭了，照理，國貨運動，總該有一個相當的成效了吧？唉！事實告訴我們，提倡者雖聲嘶力竭，可是實行者還是寥若晨星，這種情形，我們站在國貨界的立塲上看來，認爲是一件十分痛心的事。</p>
<p>提倡國貨，爲什麽没有良好的效果，良好的成績表現呢？其中的原因，雖然很多，而在上者的不能用改治的力量，來帮助推行，我認爲也是國貨運動所以不能收到效果的原因之一。</p>
<p>現在好了，記者於本月二十三日閱報，見載有社會，敎育，公安三局，會同討論取締奇裝異服的消息，其内容除規定對於男女的服裝，飭令所屬嚴予取締奇裝異服外，一方面並嚴令任何男女，以後添置服裝，應儘量的服用國貨，已由該局等擬具辦法，由警察機關切實執行，記者看到了這個消息，不禁拍案呌好，認爲是我們中國國貨運動前途的一個好現象，值得贊揚不止。</p>
<p>從這叚消息裏，使我聨想到我們中國的當局，現在對於國貨運動，也在竭力的提倡，和熱烈的贊助了，所謂「上有好者，下必有甚焉。」預料今後的國貨運動，在政府的竭力提倡之下，一定能收到良好的效果，偉大的成績。</p>
<p>最後，我尤其希望一般喜歡做洋貨推銷員的男女同胞們，你們還是快快覺悟吧！須知提倡國貨，是成爲全國上下一致的趨勢，違反了這個趨勢，便是全國國民的公敵，「公敵」是需要用政治的力量，來强制其服用國貨的，到了那個時候，恐怕連後悔也來不及了呢？</p>

<p>在四川的大中學校的女生，近年來都用鷄皮皺來做日常所穿的裙子，因爲牠旣經濟，又美觀，，卽是天天都穿在身上也不容易擦毛，滑絲，而且穿髒污了的時候，脫下來用開水冲洗，晒乾，再用熨斗盪平又跟新的時候一個樣子。本年秋季開學在即，作者特地介紹四川鷄皮皺於我熱心提倡國貨的中級學校的女同胞之前。</p>
<p>本地四川商店跟中國國貨公司，四川鷄皮皺都可買到。</p>

<h3 id="c242">局長報告 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>主席潘局長報告略謂、今天敎局舉辦本市中小學勞作成績品預備展覽會、敎部將舉辦全國中小學勞作展覽會、故令各省市先行舉辦預備展覽會、遴選作品、送京陳列、全國展覽會現已展期至十一月舉行、本市則自今日起展覽三天、分兩部舉行、中學部在尚文、小學部在西成、此次參加出品計中學二十三校、小學六十八校、與全市中小學數量相較、當然相差尚遠、但在第一次舉辦、能有這許多學校、已經不差了、因敎部通告各省市出品須於九月以前送京、而籌備時期適值各校放假、故參加者較少、現將勞作意義向各位說說、現在勞作科在小學是主要的科目、中學也重視此一部份工作、從前學校裏往往偏於文字上的智識、只知道用腦念書而忽略了用手和用力來製作物品、故目前敎育爲補救此缺點、就注意到手腦並用、這是敎育改變方向的趨勢爲什麽要有這種改變呢、因爲大家感覺到學校造就出來的學生、往往不肯吃苦、而且容易失業、故提倡職業敎育、和生産敎育要學生能勞動能工作、才不致受失業恐慌、敎部爲了要檢閱各中小學的勞作成績、故舉辦展覽會、以資互相參考觀摩、而求改進、希望各校校長和學生注意、凡擔任勞作科者一定要明白勞作科是着重於勞動工作、不是着重於書本要訓練學生不怕勞動工作、並給學生以勞動工作之機會、目前各校對於材料頗缺乏、無眞正成績表現、學生亦不認勞作爲重要科目、這希望各校加以改進云、</p>
<h3 id="c243">市長訓詞 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>繼由吳市長代表章秘書致詞略謂、勞作展覽會有重大的意義、是代表中國敎育方針轉變的趨向、並說明了中國現在民族文化之向前推進、中國的歷史、可分兩階段、在黄河流域是一階段、在長江流域又是一階段、黄河流域那時中國歷史是代表勞作、長江流域那時是不勞不作、這是造成中國民族衰落的原因、在黄流域時無論上下都注重勞作、皇帝作舟車、造宮室、才得人民信仰、中國文化在世界上才佔重要地位、到了長江流域時、由於讀書人的自命不凡、所謂「秀才不提籃、舉人不走路、」造成了不勞不作的風氣、使中國歷史改變了方向、沿至淸末一般士大夫廢科舉造新校以求改造、但結果適得其反、受了西方物質文明的引誘、人民生活更流於奢華、故中國歷史縱的方面受長江流域不勞不作的影響、横的方面受西洋物質引誘的影響、民族才到這般地位、所以我們現在要從提倡勞作來創造文化、改善人民生活、把中國固有創造的、科學的精神恢復、文化才有進步云、次由市黨部代表李二白致詞、來賓江問漁演說、會務主任陳白報告、從略、</p>

<h3 id="c257">偉大的作品在那裏？ <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 渾人</p>
<p>偉大的作品那裏去了？這問題，我可毫不遲疑地回答：偉大的作品在廢紙簏裏！</p>
<p>一定有人覺得我這答案來得奇怪，並且有這樣的詰問：國内大小刋物這樣的多，牠需要很多的文章，自是不必說的，只要作品有價値，還怕没有發表的機會嗎？</p>
<p>是的，一般人的理想都如此，但是，理想同事實是兩道的呀，事實告訴我們：各刋物的編輯先生們，他們都是抱着「門羅主義」的，他們的地盤｜刋物｜是拿來解决與他們有關係的親戚朋友們的吃飯問題的；他們正憂着「粥少僧多」，那裏還分得出一粒來給旁人？因此，當你們的稿寄去之後，他們發現稿上是署着一個與他們没有關係的人底姓名時，看也没有工夫一看便塞下廢紙簏了。</p>
<p>投篇把散稿尚且如此困難，出版單行本或集子是更不待說了。書店老閭們，都是勢利不過的，他們收稿件，是看「姓名」行事的。名作家的稿件，無論賣版權或收版稅都是不成問題的，有許多剛剛定了個書名，内容還不知在那裏便被他們預定去了。可是，他們對地位在水準以下的無名作家呢，可就大不同了。當賣稿者走近他們的辦公台時，他們藏在眼鏡内的眼睛把你渾身打量一下，再看看你那長方形的報紙包，不等你開口便訴上一套聨珠苦｜書業不景氣，農村破産，虧本……並且不時加上幾聲哈哈，哈哈哈……的獰笑，更冷酷得令人可怕，簡直使那站在他旁邊的人，没有開口的機會。</p>
<p>這種畸形現象的造成，編輯先生同書店老閭當然難逃其咎，但主要者不全在他們，而在一般盲目的讀者，因爲他們是一班毫無成見的可憐虫，抱着專看名作家著作的宗旨，文豪們說着幽默文辽好，便看幽默的雜誌同書籍：說着小品文好，他們於是又擇小品文字看，總之，文豪們放個臭屁都說是香的。至於無名作品，根本便不屑一看，好像看了之後，於他們有損害似的。書店老閭是惟利是圖的，編輯先生想飯碗安定，便不得不迎合讀者的口味，專出名作家書籍或請幾個名作家爲特約撰稿圖掙掙門面，這樣一來，無名之作，無疑地是埋没，消沈了</p>
<p>雖然，我們不能說名作家們的作品都是無價值的，而無名作家的作品都是偉大的。名作家們，他們旣能在文壇上登着，自然有他們的本領；加之閱歷深，讀書多的原故，寫出來的作品，當然不會壞的。不過，他們因爲有了名了，於是書店老閭紛紛來約書，編輯先生期期催稿，因此文債背了一身，但是又不得不各方面敷衍敷衍，這樣一來，精彩之作，自然很少了。並且，任何名作家，平生得意傑作是有限的，而所有得意傑作尤推初期作品居多，因他們所以能成名的原故，是靠着初期偉大的作品掙來的，換句話說，便是靠無名之作掙來的。這樣看來，無名之作是不容忽視的。</p>
<p>但是，目下的情形是怎樣呢？大文豪只能創些敷衍之作；各刋物的投稿者｜與編輯先生有關係的｜都是數數字數，算算能換得若干錢？無名作者的作品只有向廢紙簏裏塞。如此，那里會有偉大作品出現？</p>
<p>許多無名作者，因進身無路的原故，有志氣的都憤而「投筆爲農」或「投筆從工」了。意志薄弱的便去奔走文豪之門，希圖得他們的提携。但是，文豪們都是想名利雙收的居多，那裏還管旁人的死活？於是把整個文壇弄得「烏烟瘴氣」！</p>
<p>所以我說偉大的作品在廢紙簏裏，這恐怕不是我過甚其辭吧！</p>
<h3 id="c258">明年又呌做什麽國貨年呢？ <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 白戈</p>
<p>去年呌做國貨年，今年又呌做婦女國貨年，這究竟是什麽道理呢？</p>
<p>聽說，道理大得很，而且很多：第一，國貨年大攏統了，去年國貨年之所以没有成績，就是因爲没有人負專責，自然今年還得由婦女界負起專責來從新幹過：第二，婦女是一家中的服用底主持者，而且許多高價的貨物都服用在她們底身上，只路她們喜歡服用國貨就很好了。總之，主要的意思是說：婦女國貨年實在比較國貨年切實有效得多，所以在國貨年之後又來了一個婦女國貨年。</p>
<p>該不是像在什麽中學或大學之後又來了一個什麽女子中學或大學那樣吧？</p>
<p>不，不，决不！那是有一點不大承認女子底人格的意思底表現。女子也和男子一樣是社會的人，爲什麽凡是一般人所共有的名詞都被男子獨占去了呢？譬如說，他與她底區分就是一個例子。這完全是把婦女劃在一般人外不把婦女看成社會的人的意思。至於婦女國貨年，却就不同了。可以說意思完全是相反的：它不但呌婦女走到社會上來成爲一個社會的人，而且呌婦女代表一般人來負一部分救國的專責。這是多末值得高興的事情啊！所以，自從新年一來，這裏也在高呼婦女國貨年，那裏也在高呼婦女國貨年，彷彿到處都在轟轟轟的。</p>
<p>不過，近來又彷彿没有聞着轟轟了。成績恐怕還很不錯囉。</p>
<p>唔。據國際貿易局最近所發表的統計是這樣：一，本年度六個月内，我國婦女所耗的舶來脂粉用具，約值九十七萬元：二，婦女鑲旗袍用的花邊舶來品，約值六十萬元：三，上海婦女用口脂香，在六個月内所耗舶來的留蘭香糖約值二十三萬八千元。其他尚未發表的種種，想來也是很可觀的。而且，據說這些舶來的消耗品，大都消耗於上海一埠底貴族化的家庭及一般摩登婦女底身上。然而，以前轟轟轟地高呼婦女國貨年的不就是這些婦女嗎？可見這些婦女底婦女國貨年還是没有成績可言的。</p>
<p>那末，明年再以只能吃飯穿衣而一點也不服用這些消耗品的勞動婦女作爲代表，呌做勞動婦女國貨年來試試看吧？</p>
<p>這，自然還是没有成績可言的。首先，這些婦女就不會這樣地作，别的婦女要不要她們代表還是其次的問題。然而，主要的問題却在這里：如果國外的米麥棉布還在滾滾而來，那不久就在這些婦女底身上和腹中也找不出一點國貨來，其結果所得的成績恐怕還是會和搽脂粉，着花邊，嚼留蘭香的婦女們所得的一樣。事實上，就連現在的勞動婦女們所吃的和穿的也不大是以農立國的大中華民國底米麥棉布了。這樣一來，似乎明年底國貨年根本就找不出一種適當的人來負專責哩。</p>
<p>我想，有許多國貨之動家底心中現在正躊躇着一個問題：明年又該呌做什麽國貨年呢？</p>

<p>— 錫金</p>
<p>城河早望了天，</p>
<p>全城惶恐的飲水問題呀！</p>
<p>挑水的笑在肚子裏，</p>
<p>你們晦氣我走了運啦！</p>
<p>前幾天掛上的笑臉，</p>
<p>而今消失了；</p>
<p>挑水的仍是苦着臉，</p>
<p>逃荒老也來搶生意呀！</p>
<p>踏着氿底發湯的碎磚，</p>
<p>摇摇地又是兩桶渾水；</p>
<p>「來，來，到我家去！」</p>
<p>挑水的點了點頭跟上走。</p>
<p>抹一下額上的汗，</p>
<p>背上的汗淌下像蟲在爬；</p>
<p>水桶裏浮的草結儘旋轉，</p>
<p>眞的要倒下來麽？</p>
<p>窮人是不會有好日子的！</p>
<p>挑水的儘埋怨腰腿的不掙氣；</p>
<p>在烘烤着的太陽下，</p>
<p>挑水的也和别人一樣巴望着下雨了。</p>
<p>「終究大家都會乾死的。」</p>
<p>挑水的望着儘淺下去的外氿發愁；</p>

<p>— 戊卯</p>
<p>他把我安置好了在床上，隨又沈重地端詳了我一下，搖搖頭，嘆氣。</p>
<p>「不是玩的拉。你一定要快進醫院去，黎！」</p>
<p>我仍没有開口，朦上眼。</p>
<p>「到紅十字會醫院去，較便宜。」又是逹的話。</p>
<p>於是，我慢慢張開眼來，望着他，另外問：</p>
<p>「怎麽Ｘ書店稿費還没有送來呢？」</p>
<p>他愕了一下，接上嚅嚅地說：</p>
<p>「是的，我本打算來告訴你的，我前天到書店代你問了一問，他們說，你的那篇稿子，不用了。他們說對你很抱歉。</p>
<p>「不用了？」我幾乎突呌出來，但我没有氣力，只是瞟了他一眼。</p>
<p>「不用就算了，」朋友的安慰，接着，「今天就進醫院去，好麽？」</p>
<p>我又無力地瞟了他一眼，没有做聲。</p>
<p>朋友似乎這時才看透了我的心。他遲疑了一回，隨後問：</p>
<p>「你還有幾塊錢？我這里有三塊。如果不够，就拿衣服去，……」他感情地望着我。</p>
<p>我反而冷笑了一笑。我不明白我應該怎樣，我愛我的生命，但我唯一的希望斷絶了。我祗有拿生命去碰，向無論什麽地方去碰。我决然地說：</p>
<p>「我什麽也没有，祗有那一套西裝，你就拿去吧。」</p>
<p>他又望着我猶預了一回，終於站起來，我就去當吧，不够以後再說。</p>
<p>他從壁上取去了我唯一的財産。</p>
<p>等他回來時，已經午後了。他一踏進門，就苦痛地向我笑，「媽的，眞不值錢，只當兩塊。」一回，不等我開口，又似安慰我般繼續說：「也差不多够了，還是到濟Ｘ醫院，那裏只要交一點錢就行。我們走吧，我已呌好了黄包車在門口。」</p>
<p>逹的好意我是應該感激的。我也苦笑着爬起了床，雖然我覺得窮人進醫院，並不會醫好病，我却不能不去碰一碰了。</p>
<p>我扶着逹，下了樓，扶着逹上了車。</p>
<p>一路上，有風，有太陽，我直躺在車上，整個身體好似拆散了。天在旋轉，地在旋轉一切在旋轉……。</p>
<p>然而，我忍着，因爲我是進醫院。</p>
<p>醫院的猙獰的鐵門是半閉着的，門口滿紥的紅綠紙，也許這又是上帝的恩典，這醫院是屬於上帝的。</p>
<p>逹扶我從側門走到了掛號室。不等我們開口，先有一個坐在掛號室門口的小夥子攔住問　　「做什麽？」</p>
<p>「掛號，看病，」逹回答。</p>
<p>「特别掛號五塊。」</p>
<p>「我們掛普通號。」</p>
<p>「不行，今天Ｘ節日。」</p>
<p>我不知什麽時候又在風和太陽内旋轉，不知什麽時候又躺到那陰森的亭子間内，昏沉沉地閉着眼，一切希望没有了。</p>
<h3 id="c261">弟弟（四） <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 周文</p>
<p>不過，弟弟這蠻勁兒有時候是很有用的。有一回在離開門口不遠，我被一個同學欺侮的時候，我紅着臉把手一揚，可是這位同學並不怕，依然直衝地站在我的面前，弄得我許多圍着的人們都哄笑了。可是弟弟却舞動着一根大秤杆吆喝着趕上來了，老遠就聽見鐵秤鈎摇撞在秤杆上叮噹的聲音。那同學掉轉屁股就跑，弟弟還追了十幾步。圍着看的人們自然又哈哈的笑，可是這笑聲的意味又不同先前的了。</p>
<p>媽有時候，在無可如何中，停着手上的針線，睜着遐想似的眼睛，自己安慰自己地喃喃說着：</p>
<p>「算命的說我還有十年就交運了，你們兩弟兄是一文一武，十年……」</p>
<p>雖然十年，然而在母親那嘴角上一刹的微笑好像表示着並不算長。不過這以後，她覺得究竟非把弟弟送進學校不可了。就是關也把他關在學校裏，於是坐着來等這「十年」！究竟因爲錢的關係，弟弟跟我只好各人進一個不同的學校，他是跟那些光脚板的孩子們同學的。還不到一年我就看見他讀破了五本三字經。那學校的先生在怎樣的敎法，學生在怎樣的讀法，那只有天曉得。我在外縣放暑假回家的時候，聽見媽說，先生喜歡抽鴉片烟，弟弟是常常在小河裏水淋淋地拉回來的。</p>

<h3 id="c287">關懷民食與救濟農村 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>今年天氣亢陽，久旱不雨，蘇浙皖贛等省爲尤劇，田地龜坼，禾稻枯槁，災象已成。上海的米價因之迭漲，以前六七元一石的，現在已經賣到十二三元一石，幾乎貴了一倍。然而三百多萬的人口却不能不吃飯，看着米價日益步漲太息，也只得將一疉疉的洋錢往米店送去。所以處處在赤日當中之下，無數的農民一面揮汗戽水，一面望着乾枯的禾稻哭泣，城市裏工人爲米價增貴的重壓而呻吟，但是那些去年以「豐收」而賤價購囤米糧的大腹賈，却坐在電風扇旁，望着這許多源源而來的飛來横財，瞇花眼笑，歡心悅意。</p>
<p>這種現象用不着在那兒「懷抱琵琶半遮面」的遮遮掩掩，老老實實，在旱已成災的時候，廣大的民衆，滴滴的汗涙就是這些高坐居奇的大腹賈吮吸的源泉，「民食堪虞」實成米商發財的好機會罷了。可是誰也不這樣承認，總妞妞妮妮，借些話頭來解釋；卽如這次上海的買洋米與不買洋米這問題，便是這樣一幕滑稽劇。</p>
<p>自從上海米價飛漲以後，荳米業便建議訂購洋米五十萬石，並且請求政府免稅進口。此事一時引起各方的嚴重注意，上海市商會，雜糧號業同業公會，内地米商長沙商會等均開會發宣言打通電，不一而足，認爲無採購洋米必要，呈請中央，嚴予制止。而主張採購洋米者說：災象已成，民食堪虞，米價飛漲，人民不勝重負，亟應免稅採購洋米，抑平米價，以濟民食，而居然也是愛國愛民的一篇大道理。</p>
<p>以同行同業而竟出之以互相攻訐，眞的是爲了「關懷民食救濟農村」的問題有所爭執麽？這實在有些使人懷疑。已囤集了許多米的人，或自己保有糧米的内地米商。自然望着米價的上漲歡喜，總想其愈高愈妙，洋米的進口就阻碍了他們抬高市價的企圖；他們高喊採購洋米破壞農村，影響國民經濟，就没有看見他們减低米價來「以維民食」。至於主張採購洋米的人，他們眼看着米價的高漲，有利可圖，便滿想豁免關稅來作一筆大生意，於是借題發揮，以「抑平米價蘇濟民食」爲名，盡量的購入洋米。最近西貢米十六萬石的成交，就是這一實例。</p>
<p>其實反對購洋米者，眞的救濟了農村麽？一般農民於去年秋收後因租債稅的交迫已賤價將米悉數售出且不用說，卽以各地米價之居奇步漲藉獲高利，已說明了這一用意。而採購洋米者，眞的是在關心民食抑平米價麽？我們看最近成交的十六萬石，自己亦表明待善價出售，也可以見其眼光所在，絶非在於「蘇濟民食」。這是二十世紀人聰明的地方，明明在際此災荒，大家進行「趁火打刦」，却偏有許多做作，不過明眼人總可認識，彼之所謂「關懷民食救濟農村」，純粹加以粉飾撈銅鈿之「生意經」而已！</p>
<h3 id="c288">論「文學遺産」與「洋八股」 <a href="#c288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— 明堂</p>
<p>我很佩服「文學」一班人的本領。</p>
<p>前次我偶而看到一本「文學」二卷六號「中國文學研究專號」。開卷有兩篇短文，專論中國文學遺産問題。他們的意見是：中國文學遺産，是值得整理的。中國文學遺産，有無數量的金沙，藴藏在一片沙漠内：這金沙只待我們去發掘。我們要從無數量的中國文學遺産中，整理出揀選出我們所需要的東西（大意如此，因原文不在手邊，無從引用原句）。我當時覺得很奇怪。我們目前所需要的，似乎是要能表現矛盾（客觀現實的矛盾）解决矛盾的文學。而「文學」在這個時候、却顚倒着來提議什麽整理中國文學遺産，接受中國文學遺産。這是什麽意思呢？所以當時我就隨筆寫了一篇短評，登在本刋談言欄内。我的意見是：中國文學遺産，誠然，是值得整理的。但現在這個時候，却不是我們來從容做這整理中國文學遺産接受中國文學遺産的時候罷？所以我的結論是：「文學」所提議的整理中國文學遺産，接受中國文學遺産，只不過是逃避現實，逃避矛盾的一個更巧妙的方法而已。除此以外，是不會有什麽别的意思的。當時我寫那篇文章，原不預料到有人會「特别重視」的，而且「文學」一班人也根本不會「特别重視」到我那篇不堪「特别重視」的所謂「洋八股」。不料「文學」却居然表面上「並不特别重視」的而重視到我那篇不堪「特别重視」的所謂「洋八股」了。在「文學」三卷二號上，發現了署名「風」君的一篇文章，題名「「文學遺産」與「洋八股」」。對於我那篇文章，好好的下了一個攻擊。他的結論是：我那篇文章，是十足的「洋八股」；其次，他們所以要提出整理中國文學遺産，接受中國文學遺産這一提案呢，據說是爲了要「到中國舊文學營壘中去放炸彈」！與替中國文學來進行「消毒」運動。這樣，他們的提出整理中國文學遺産，接受中國文學遺産這一提案，便變成很「冠冕堂皇」的反「迷戀舊文學」而引導到前進路上的很有意義的工作了。這是一個很巧妙不過的「設詞」。然而明眼人誰都看得到的。這是不是事實呢？可憐，連所謂「三尺孩童」，恐怕也有點難以相信罷。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c289">病邊漫筆之三 <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— 紅茶</p>
<p>過去，因爲自己的興趣，舊詩詞之外，書畫金石，都弄過，病中無聊，又想恢復舊時的生活，目的自然在消閑，但是又怕勞神，對於病體有礙，現在且把過去的事情，寫一點出來以當望梅解渴罷。</p>
<p>在小學裏，我的字，寫得非常壞，將畢業的時候，還寫不過三年級的同學，父親也常常當面說過，不過總没辦法寫好。</p>
<p>後來，偶然從三希堂法帖中間抽出一本黄山谷的字來，覺得很歡喜。尤其是「詩送四十九姪」那一篇大字於是就拿筆摹了幾遍，第二天又臨，幾次，拿給一個考究書畫的先生看，眞是出我意料之外啊！他竟說很好。不但說很好，并且在紙上用紅筆批上一句「大有瘞鶴銘筆意。」我回去就翻「瘞鶴銘」看，果然非常對勁，於是我就用心臨瘞鶴銘，那位先生并且天天來指正。眞的字無百日功，二月之後，居然很可看了。先生又在紙上批一些「點有高山奔石之勢，劃有千里陣雲之妙」等句子？越發使我高興。但是根底全無，一開始就學純以神行的字，雖則筆意相近，到底不能使自己的字有整幅的章法。以至單獨看每一個字都可以，整幅一看，就十分難看，因爲瘞鶴銘已經是殘碑，全無字與字之間，行與行之間的映帶了。這時候自己知道危險，于是就再學張猛龍等等，然而一無效果。後來看到一本黄山谷的在　文，穆顔魯公的祭　文稿，覺得十分歡喜，就拿來臨摹，但是積習已深，再也不能完全改正了。</p>
<p>至於畫，我一向就歡喜的，在小學三年級時候就能够畫得和繡像三國誌演義上那些人物差不多的黄忠周瑜了。在臨瘞鶴銘的時候，我周始畫山水，那時聽了先生的話，學四王之首的王翬，因爲他的中鋒的彼麻皺，是最無弊病，而我那位先生，却是學倪高士的折帶皺的，無意之中，我又跟着先生走。兼學折帶。如此就使我的畫，進步很慢，後來看到黄鶴山樵的作品，覺得氣魄沉雄，在於王翬之上，又去了倪王去學他，這樣愈弄愈糟。不多時，又從畫架上翻到石濤上人的東西，覺得「眞我師也，」又丢下黄鶴山樵去學他，雖則性情相近，能够得其大概，但是到底不好。</p>
<p>在學畫山水的時候又看到完白山人（鄧石如）的印譜，一時高興，又從抽屜裏找出了舊鐵筆石章亂刻。那時是先把字用筆寫在石章上，然後照字刻，後來知道這樣刻是不對的，就信手亂刻，這時候看的印譜又太雜，因此我的金石，也和書畫犯了同樣的病。</p>
<p>至於最後三年來，因爲四方奔走，連毛筆也長久没拿了。何况當此尸城血海之時，新興的藝術正待學習和發揮，此時而談古老的金石書畫，實在是骸骨迷戀。不過在我總是積習未除，特别是病中無事，不知不覺的想到那時的趣味罷了。</p>
<p>最後，在和我差不多的年齡的現代靑年中，弄過這些的，恐怕已經很少了。這是他們的幸運，因爲在我自己的確舊學問弄得太久太雜，而觀念上受到大影響的，但是怎樣辦呢？</p>
<h3 id="c290">秋院 <a href="#c290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— 望樓</p>
<p>初秋了，和爽的天氣雖然敎人興作舒適之感，可是悲苦的心上却又不免蒙了一層傷感的網呢？「不要多所感觸了，過了一個秋天才會有冬天和春天呢。」有時候也總會這樣地打個譬如，意想拂去心裏的暗影，可是暗影却還是跟着時間的邁進在長足的長成。預感着在不久之後，這暗影將又會吞没我整個的心啦。</p>
<p>暑天敎人又懶又倦，日夜企盼秋風會吹散了這個熱𡇇，在想望中差不多秋天像是一個慈悲的上帝，他會帶來的，幾乎没有一件不是有惠於你的東西，彷彿唯有他會普渡衆生，將煉獄裏的罪犯一個一個的提拯。</p>
<p>果然秋天是如望地降臨了，榆錢樹的影子首先便疏淡地映在窗上，花，草，一倣就變得那樣的枯黄，夜風吹着，靜，凉，淸爽，該是我們感謝秋，感謝秋的時候，可是我心却又陷入濃重的悽傷。</p>
<p>我們何嘗不曉得，秋天也不過是一年裏的一個季節，正如春天冬天一樣，没有什麽可喜或可悲的，可是人總是那麽樣地乖巧，又那麽樣的迂腐，當着春來，便滿臉堆着笑，尋春惜春，對於秋天却祗有悲她甚而至於哭她，司秋之神與司春的使者原也是一樣地快樂着或是全皆無有敎人喜或哀的存心，她們不過是時間的轉變，對待我們人，原是一般地公平，可是我們人却是把這生生地分做成一個可愛，一個可憎。</p>
<p>在幼年的稚心裏，秋天並不曾和别的季候劃成了不同的型，春天固然可以把柳條做成柳球，夏天也可以捉子蟬，秋天，更有着許多蟋蟀呌着誘引我們去找牠，一年四季都是那麽高興和快樂，可是年紀一年一年的大了，對於平時喜歡着的過年，也慢慢地失掉他原有的快樂，祗一味地覺得過了一年又大了一歲啦，到秋天，也漸漸地會聽得風風雨雨而生出不快之感，人說我大了，我說我苦得多了。因爲那時候的捉蟋蟀的高興非但絲毫都不存在，連到聽得秋蟲吱唧都覺悽然。快樂的童年的心，早給頻頻的悲苦掩埋得深深了。</p>
<p>而今在人世更又多活了幾年，在秋院看着寂寞的長空，我的心情已跟階前的小蟲的嗚聲一樣地微　。</p>
<p>秋境裏的人，將走入了人的秋境！</p>
<h3 id="c291">秋蕉痕裏 <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 穆因</p>
<p>經着長時間的日曬，露潰，風吹，雨打的綠色蕉葉，留痕中錯踪着冲怒，媚愛，逍遥，悲怨的各種幽態，這極難於推測的處女心情。幻現着冰炭似的一些元素，料不到在這凛秋剥削厲害的時節；會把它佇蓄長久的申展計劃破壞，僅存着幾斤殘喘的棄兒爲我們共悲。</p>
<p>它覺得還算榮幸，不先殘於香桂，而能享觀新肥的菊，但東籬佳色勾引的，和雄將氣魄的擺動。刺觸牠貧弱的性命，儲着恢復的居心。眞的，它雖然是幾片不整殘綠，可是尋找的機會，無時不會忘去他努力的想像。</p>
<p>風是陣陣的吹。四隣的擦葉聲沙沙的響。秋桐的剥摘，伴着殘蕉的削裂互成彈調，它高莖之下的弱草，爲生存的希望，願犧牲去寳貴濃露的濕潤。而哀求它保存僅有的弱力爲彼作庇護。</p>
<p>爲同類的重托，爲生命的存留，不得不忍泣的掙扎。自衛的戰秋呀！以會全部的犧牲了美觀，這因爲是他衝怒的所致。</p>
<p>秋月湧出了晶亮的素色，像會繫動一切魂魄便成宇宙幽沉。寒螿的悲泣！是感秋露冰冷，它｜蕉，在這落桐破幽沉的月下，　有這靜中的動伴着它過長夜。自吊已遭遇着的命運。</p>

<p>— 臧菲</p>
<p>寗靜的七月的黄昏，帶着冷峭的細雨壓上了每個鬱悶的心。惘然的踏着油滑的道路，黯淡的路燈下，一個影子在我身旁幌着，從後面伸過一隻手。</p>
<p>「做什麽？」一隻枯瘦的膀子被我抓住了！他張着驚呆的眼睛，用乞憐的聲調說：「好小姐！放了我吧！我肚子餓我要吃飯呀！」</p>
<p>看着那幼稚的無邪的面孔，我的手鬆了，很難過的注視那被黑暗吞去了的影子：「他才那樣一點年紀呀！」</p>
<p>接着「我要吃飯」這聲音，便又頑强的在我耳邊響着。這在我是熟習的，於是許多黄瘦的面孔就浮到了眼前：我看到他們抓起了枯黄的樹葉貪婪的往嘴裏送；我看到他們瘋狂似的吃着從鐵軌上拖回來的血淋淋的孩子，｜去年新聞報上曾登載過，什麽地方我忘了｜父母因爲饑餓而又不忍親自殺死孩子，就將他放到鐵軌上，給輾死了再拖回去。｜我更看到他們用自己的和結束了活躍躍的生命。</p>
<p>一陣强烈的燈光照着我，我已走到一條熱閙的馬路了，什麽都没有｜留下的是那副無邪的面孔，那雙驚呆的眼睛。</p>
<p>汽車瘋狂似的跑着，猛然一個思想闖到腦中：「倘使他生在富貴的家庭裏，他不是一樣有着一個𤈎爛的桃色的童年嗎？但是現在，是什麽剥奪了他們的靑春？是什麽剥奪了他們生存的權利？」</p>
<p>默默地走到校中，看到那巍峨堂皇的校門；想起這人材缺乏的中國，想起了那些飄泊街頭的流浪者。</p>
<p>雨還下着，天上黑漆漆的没有一顆星。</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我有一個疑難的問題，請求替我解决。事情是這樣的。</p>
<p>大約在四十年以前，我的父親，在某一個親戚那裏，留下了一紙會單，說是我父親的親筆。｜是否親筆，因爲我還没有見過我父親的手筆，實是一個問題。｜那時，不但我還没有出世，而且我的母親，也没有娶過門來。</p>
<p>在三十幾年以前，父親才娶了母親，接着就生了我。又三年，不幸我的父親，棄我倆母子二人而長逝。從此寡婦孤兒，相依爲命的過了二十幾年的淸苦生活，直到現在，並没有知道有這麽一回事。</p>
<p>日昨，不料那位曾有幾十年不和我家來往的親戚，居然到我家來催討那筆所謂會欵了，而且對我倆出了不少難以聽聞的話，大有要用法律來向我追償的意思。我受了這樣的侮辱，眞是忍無可忍。正在我一籌莫展的時候，忽地裏想到貴報有業餘通訊一欄，能指示我們一切難題，不揣冒昧，特地把這事的始末詳情，陳述一遍，並提出幾個問題，希望替我一一解答，不勝待命之至。此請</p>
<p>撰安　　珍上</p>
<p>其問題如下：</p>
<p>（一）照例一紙會單，在法律上，是否能發生效力？</p>
<p>（二）如果那會單，眞是我父親的親筆，我是否應該負償還之責？</p>
<p>（三）要是在光緖十幾年以前的借票，到現在還能發生效騐的話，那麽，這一紙四十年前的會單，是否也同樣地能發生效騐嗎？</p>
<p>（四）要是不幸眞的發生訟事，此後我該用怎樣方法對付？</p>
<p>答：來信收到已很久了，遲遲未復，原因是積壓的信實在太多。你所說的「會單」我不大明白，不知是否卽「借據」。但對方旣希圖憑藉該項憑據向你請求返還債務，則對方所有者爲「請求權」無疑。按照現行民法規定：「請求權因十五年間不行使而消滅」該項會欵已隔有四十餘年，且向未對你們催討，當然向你們催討的權利是喪失了。所以，你不必着急，不論有無該項會欵，該會單是眞是假，總之，已是喪失時效不成問題的了。至于對方要提出訴訟，不是他全無法律常識，就是欺你不懂事，嚇嚇你的，你儘可不必懼怕也。</p>

<p>「伍老太爺是……」</p>
<p>「老太爺再公斷没有…」</p>
<p>「伍老太爺…」</p>
<p>預料着的讚聲在富公公的耳邊像轟雷似的響着。伍老太爺微笑地捋着頦下齊整的鬍鬚，他覺得今天完成了一件得意的傑作。</p>
<p>張得富拉開了嘴，他勝利了。同時見到伍老太爺得意的暗示，忙推着富生的肩頭說：</p>
<p>「謝謝伍公公，這末大熱天！」</p>
<p>「没有事，没有事的，」伍老太爺滿不在意的說，「富生常同你媽到我家來走走，自家人不要反見生疏。」</p>
<p>「要來的，伍公公。」張得富搶着代答了。</p>
<p>伍老太爺摇着鵝毛扇就從太師椅裏站起身來，整整衣襟，「好罷？」像徵求衆人的同意似的，「我們可以走了。」</p>
<p>富公公彷彿從夢中驚醒回來，他正靜聽着裏面的呌駡聲，一時不知所措地忘了說幾句客套的話，反而富生說了：</p>
<p>「伍公公，等太陽下山了再走罷。」</p>
<p>「好孩子！興隆茶館裏還有人等着我哩。」</p>
<p>伍老太爺挈了他的手一路向外走一邊說，「到我家去玩好嗎？」</p>
<p>一行人隨着他們背後出來，富公公沉着臉走在最後。</p>
<p>兩扇烏黑的大牆門開了，門外探頭探腦的鄰居忙閃過一旁，轎夫們把轎子從樹蔭底下打到門前來。衆人謝過了伍老太爺，才各自坐轎歸去。富公公却像失了魂似的呆望着遠去的轎影，長長地嘆一口氣，回過身來恨恨地把大門碰上了。</p>
<p>許多對疑惑的眼光投射在黑牆門上，他們始終不明白今天富公公家衆親會集，爲的什麽一回大事。</p>
<p>太陽慢慢的從牆門上移西，蟬聲還是老遠地噪着。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c295">麗琳哈蕙最後的努力 <a href="#c295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>倘無成就即將重返歐洲</p>
<p>過份宣傳足以召致反響</p>
<p>很奇怪的，我們上海一般觀衆所喜歡看的，那位嬌小輕盈的麗琳哈蕙，在好萊塢似乎已經有些站不住脚了。從好萊塢的各種電影雜誌中看來，他們似乎並不因爲她的瀕於失敗，而有什麽深切惋惜與同情的表示。並且因爲美國的一般觀衆或劇評家，並不如我們上海的過於重視内容與意識，所以這實在是件很難費解的事。（但是有一家雜誌曾說過：「要是我們讓她絶裾而去，那是好萊塢不可恕的罪惡。）據說她最近拍演了一張（Serenade），要是她在這張片子裏，没有十二分的成功，她就不再在好萊塢討生活了。這或者是一句大膽的預告，但却是她自己親口告訴人的。她說：「要是這張片子不是一個特殊的成功，我和好萊塢就完了」！</p>
<p>我們自從看了她初次在上海放映的「龍翔鳳舞」（Congress　Dances）之後，心坎中已經深深印了她的芳影，一直到最後的「木偶寄情」（I　am　suzgnne），對於她的感想，都是很好的。其中還有幾張她拍的法國語的片子，亦都有相當喚座的能力。她在好萊塢的年月並不久，可是在狐狸公司中，雖然珍妮蓋諾｜｜同樣是一位上海大多數觀衆們所喜歡看的一位女星｜｜在事實上佔着皇后的位子，她却已成了第一個紅星了。她去年一共拍了三張片子，營業都還不差，但麗琳自己却十二分的不滿意於她的作品。你知道，這位小姐是口直心快的人。她想什麽就說什麽；說什麽就做什麽。她旣自己不滿意於她自己的作品，她就不願永久這樣的媽虎下去。她說：「要不是頂好的，就是頂壞的。要不是大成功，還是永遠離開美國的好。」</p>
<p>有一位新聞記者去訪問她，她竟自己對着自己大發其牢騷起來。她說：「我在這裏是失敗了。我自己知道的。照我的合同，我拍完了這張片子，還要拍兩張，但是我却覺得（Serenade）是我最後的一張片子了。要是結果平平的話，那就不用再試了。我還是回家去吧」。麗琳的家，就是法國南部利佛拉的一所時髦别墅。那末她要回到歐洲去拍片子了。她又說道：「觀衆們化了錢去尋娛樂，你不能强制他們接受一個他們所不歡喜的明星的。我嘗自己跑到影戲院裏，採取他們的批評。我想他們並不愚笨，他們有很好的判斷力，他們能够欣賞眞的娛樂。但是在歐洲，他們是很喜歡我的！」的確，麗琳哈蕙在歐洲，是一位最紅的女星。她在柏林拍的「龍翔鳳舞」，到處受人歡迎，而狐狸公司的聘請她到美國，亦曾爲她特别的擴大宣傳過。</p>
<p>可是這個擴大的宣傳，據麗琳自己說，却就是她的致命傷。麗琳没有到好萊塢之先，狐狸已經開始大吹大擂起來了。看報的天天讀到她的行程，好像一位外國的皇后來游歷似的。她到好萊塢的時候，四十只大鐵箱的行裝，僕從如雲的跟着她，還有一輛銀白色的「來路貨」大汽車。狐狸公司並且爲她在公司空地上，布置了一所精緻絶倫的住宅，裏面一切布置陳設，都是取精用宏，不惜金錢的買來討她的歡心的。但是現在麗琳却說，「這些都害了我了！我並没有需索這許多奢侈的東西呀。那種宣傳，亦不是我喜歡的。反而在觀衆們的心理上，發生了一種反響了。當大衆們，聽見了這許多好聽的話，他們以爲世界上的奇蹟出現了哩。等到他們一看，並没有什麽特别驚人的希奇，他們就廢然而返了。不然他們可以很喜歡我的。宣傳得太厲害了！」麗琳是一位受過高等敎育的一位天才女子，當然她的話是很足以發人深想的了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c296">評「孽海浮生」 <a href="#c296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Whirlpool｜｜大光明</p>
<p>不管這一影片在中國遭受到如何程度底的冷酷的待遇，我們得承認它是哥倫比亞公司較好的出品，也是美國片中值得一看的作品。但是這一影片所以不受歡迎的原因，也許是因爲賈克霍爾這個名字對於一般中國觀衆印象不深吧。</p>
<p>說到影片本身，雖然其中仍包含着許多錯誤，不過大體上說，它是不使我們十分失望的。我們想，當一個人極力想從惡劣的環境中振拔起來，可是這社會並不容許他的志願，結果墮落的人終於祗有墮落下去，最後祗得悲慘的死亡。因此，林肯的在孽海中浮沉，他努力自救，他有着好的良心，情願犧牲自己以成全妻女的幸福，他那悲慘的自殺，到死後他的苦心始終不爲妻子所了解，從這些地方，劇作者使觀衆十分同情他，這無論如何是勝利了的。</p>
<p>從這方面說，劇作者緊抓住人情作爲主要的方法，在這裏完成了傷感的倫理的悲哀。然而正因爲如此，他將這種人間的悲劇，完全作爲唯心的勸誘。於是他以爲一個墮落了的人，假使他有良心的話，他應當犧牲自己而完成妻女的幸福，甚至於自殺亦在所不惜。這不能對於社會有着嚴正的分析和解剖，將社會問題之一嚴重的部份依賴於個人的善惡，自然是没有方法得着解决的了。這種要求，對於電影作家並不過份，不過對於美國大多數的劇作家，都是非常困難的事。</p>
<p>再說一遍，就在這一度程爲止，劇作者以至於導演的表現方法，仍使我們爲之感動的。當（一）林肯被宣判徒刑二十年之後，他們夫妻隔着鐵網相對哭泣的時候，使我們回想到林肯在打死人的以前，夫妻們在快步而又略帶感傷的玩弄着結婚戒指，以及在宣判的當時之擁抱·慘痛的分離，那種深刻的感動，眞祗有電影才能做到。（二）在獄中，林肯悲哀的開始度過那攸久的歲月。可是同房的那人却拚命圖逃，結果也祗是從高處下躍入水，在綿密的槍聲之下，我們祗見黑夜的水中浮出無數的水泡和浪花，而這一條生命便是如此結束了。（三）林肯自獄中刑滿出來，兩扇大的鐵門在他身後沉重的關上，他開始獲着自由，懷着無窮的希望，仰首望着靑天。他在獄中度過了半生，到如今頭髮已經灰白，世界也已經改變了許多，新式的汽車對於他未嘗不引起奇感。（四）他是一個心地良好的人，他自保着女兒的骨肉情愛之後，他决心不再去營救他的黨徒。但是社會不能容許他，逼於不得已的時候，他只得殺死那一個訟棍。然後他燒了妻的相片，凝望着她的面容在火中毁滅。這使我們聨想到他第一次向女兒問道：「你的母親怎樣了？她過得很快樂嗎？」以及深夜在酒吧間歡樂的接受已經華貴了的妻的相片。然後女兒和老友聽見一聲槍響，這一個一生剛毅而不甘墮落的人，便從此終結。在這裏導演將兩次槍聲都配在女兒與老友的面部特寫上。特别是最後來的一聲，我們看到女兒和老友的臉，那感動的程度，决不是一般庸俗的導演所能做到的。（五）一個渺小的死，對於人間並不能引起深切的同情。在靜寂的夜中，Radio雖然將他的死訊當作新聞資料而播送，可是那不過是十分平凡的事，他的死並不能擊破死一般沉靜的空氣。妻在旁邊靜靜的綉花，她對於他的半生，始終没有絲毫了解。平凡的生，平凡的死，一切都是平凡的過去。………這傷感的氣氛，我們不能不承認作者確是勝利的震撼了我們的悲哀。</p>
<p>當我們看過「亡命者」之後再看到這一「孽海浮生」，其中有不少相同之處。如僅就表現方法上說，那末前者在緊張刺戟方面乃是非常成功的，而後者在許多自然而生動的笑料上，使劇情一點也不覺着沉悶，使悲哀與歡樂調劑着進行，又是洛依威廉尼爾，（Roy　WilliamNeill）的特長。假使說前者使我們興奮悲哀，而後者使我們傷感，憂鬱，乃是充分做到了。</p>
<p>演員們自然是主角賈克霍爾（JackHolt）演得最好，而其餘諸人也都很適職。</p>
<h3 id="c297">美國電影的新傾向 <a href="#c297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>最近美國電影界有兩種新傾向，那就是他們將大量地製作文學電影和古典電影。</p>
<p>一·文學電影美高梅公司將製作狄更斯的，「David　Copperfield」。聨藝公司將製作托翁的「復活」，由安娜史丹和弗特立馬區合演，導演大概是馬穆林。以及大杜馬的「Count　of　Moncristo」，和賈克倫敦的「野性的呼聲」。華納公司將製作辛克萊劉易士的「巴比特」。還有環球公司將製作亞倫玻的「大烏鴉」云。</p>
<p>二·古典電影因爲美高梅公司的「寳島」，成績很好，所以各公司都相競攝製古典電影了。聽說華維公司已開始製作「普拉脫船主」。二十世紀公司也已把弗特立馬區和康斯登裴納合演的，「The　Affairs　of　Cellim」攝製成功。至於雷電華公司亦將使凱絲琳海本主演，拍一部女王影片云。</p>

<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>安娜跑到外面，急急忙忙地打了一個電話，到愛温頓曼麗那裏。她呌侍女不用煮茶了，給她些水喝好了。她喝了一口水，就滿臉帶着毅然决然的神氣，出了大門，跳上一輛汽車，就一直往愛温頓去了。她到了愛温頓，就直捷爽快地將這件事和曼麗說了。她告訴曼麗，那天生小孩子的晚上，蒙尼卡就知道那孩子是約翰的，現在蒙尼卡爲了這件事，要和約翰永遠離開了。曼麗起初聽了蒙尼卡要和約翰離開，臉上露着希望之色，她以爲蒙尼卡去後，約翰就可以屬於她一個了。安娜看了她的臉，明白她的意思，就講給她聽道：「要是約翰仍舊愛你的話，那當然是兩樣了，但是約翰現在已經不愛你了。我說的都是實在的話。」曼麗臉上的光輝，立時渙散了。她遲疑了一下說道：「哦。那再好没有了。因爲………」她又頓了一頓，因爲這個謊言離事實太遠了，使她幾乎不能開口了，「我現在亦不愛他了。」安娜知道她的心事，很憐惜地摟着她勸着她道：「女子爲愛情所誤的，眞是太多了。你又何必傷心呢？」曼麗道：「我明天會將一切事情弄好的。」到了明天下午，蒙尼卡從外面回到家裏，那侍女很驚慌地來開着門，告訴她曼麗小姐送了一個小孩子來。她告訴蒙尼卡說：「那送小孩子來的看護說過，一切的事情，你都明白的。」蒙尼卡道：「但是我不明白。勃蘭敦先生呢？」愛瑪說：「先生還没有回來哩。」蒙尼卡歎了一口氣，心亦定了許多。她走進她的臥房，看着那小孩子睡在床上。蒙尼卡帶着希奇的眼光，看着那小孩。愛瑪於是又送過一封信來，就是那看護留下的。蒙尼卡打開信看着，她的呼吸急促了，臉色亦變了。愛瑪問道：「要緊不要緊？」蒙尼卡露着慌張的神氣道：「不要緊。這孩子是一個朋友寄養在這裏的。」愛瑪道：「你不是今天晚上就要動身的嗎？」蒙尼卡道：「我的計劃，恐怕要變更一下子了。」她說着低下頭去，凑到那小孩子的臉上，心中想念着曼麗，很感謝她將一切安排得那樣好。這個時候，外面門響了，她知道約翰回來了，連忙將小孩子放了下來，奔到外面去。約翰走了進來，對着蒙尼卡凄然地道：「再過幾個鐘點，這個地方就兩樣了，」蒙尼卡吞吞吐吐地道：「約翰，我有一句話要告訴你。我……我不知道你怎樣的對付它。」約翰莫名其妙地看着，等她說下去，可是電話很急促響了起來，將蒙尼卡的話頭打斷了。電話筒裏的是安娜的聲音。她帶着哭聲問道：「蒙尼卡，你看見報紙没有？」蒙尼卡道：「没有呀。什麽事？」安娜道：「曼麗坐了她自己的飛機，向大西洋面飛去了。她祗帶着幾個鐘頭的汽油………」安娜的聲音，嗚咽着說不下去了。蒙尼卡聽着呆住了。原來她坐了飛機，並不是像她信中所說，回家去的。她掛了電話，背對着約翰站着，竭力地要鎭靜她自己。約翰還問道：「她不來送你嗎？」蒙尼卡道：「一回兒，我還要去看她哩。」約翰又問道：「你剛才要和我說的，到底是什麽？」蒙尼卡拉了他的手，將他一領，領到臥房裏，那裏他看見了一個小孩子。他很驚奇地看着蒙尼卡，一時說不出話來。蒙尼卡道：「我要領她，好不好？」約翰道：「好不好？不是我們想了很久了嗎？」蒙尼卡看着她，一時說不出歡樂，還是痛苦。她抱起那孩子來，放在約翰的手裏道：「約翰，你抱抱她，她是你的。」她倒退了一步，眼涙直流了出來。她從窗口望着將黑的天色，默默地向曼麗告了一個慘然的别。（完）</p>

<p>Bandit Gang Occupies Gaoqiao Town</p>
<p>Threatens to Set Houses on Fire</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The fake plainclothes troops occupying Kongque Village in Yutian, after being fiercely attacked by the Yutian County Chief Chen Baosheng leading the militia and the Yutian Security Reinforcement Team, could not withstand and retreated to occupy Gaoqiao Town. The Security Reinforcement Team Leader Sun Jizhou led a detachment of police early on the 28th to besiege them, and with the assistance of County Chief Chen Baosheng, sealed off the area around the bandit stronghold. On the evening of the 27th, the bandit gang retreated to Gaoqiao Town, piling firewood on the roofs of houses, and driving the villagers, men, women, old and young, to stand naked in the firewood piles, threatening the besieging troops that if they intensified their attack, they would set fire to the houses and the villagers, making it impossible for the besieging police to advance. Gaoqiao Town has been occupied by the bandit gang, and the women, old and young, have been subjected to wanton abuse, with countless tragic deaths. The village has a total of 5,000 residents, known for its wealth, but after being looted by the bandits, there is little hope of recovery. (28th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The bandit gang occupied Kongque Village in Yutian for a day and a night, setting fire to 80 civilian houses when retreating, resulting in the tragic deaths of eight villagers, five being kidnapped, and incalculable losses of livestock and property. Nineteen women were raped, and five were abducted, including a wealthy household surnamed Li, whose family was ordered by the bandits to prepare 300,000 yuan for ransom. The bandits kidnapped more than ten villagers along the way when retreating to Gaoqiao Town. The bandit gang has now expanded to 180 members, all equipped with large and small firearms. Half of the plainclothes bandit troops harassing Yutian are remnants of the pseudo-Rehe army under Zhang Haipeng, who infiltrated the Great Wall line and were taken in and manipulated by Shi Yousan. The other half are remnants of the Liu Guitang bandit troops from Xuzhou, who wandered here. The bandit gang had gathered in Tangshan successively half a month ago to replenish their arms and ammunition, and some people tried to persuade Zhao Lei to join, but Zhao, satisfied with his current position, refused to blindly follow. It is said that Liu Zuozhou also refused. Zhao Lei and Liu Zuozhou signaled to the pseudo-troops not to cause trouble in their respective defense areas, otherwise they would not be polite, so the pseudo-troops turned to harass Yutian, intending to contact the old Shi Yousan security team in the area to launch an uprising, but that team also did not move. The authorities predict that it can be resolved soon. (29th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Yin Tong Returned to Ping Yesterday <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Meeting with Gu Mengyu</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong arrived in Ping this morning. According to discussions, principles have long been agreed upon regarding the reorganization of the war zone, such as the crackdown on Japanese and Korean vagrants in the war zone, the takeover of Malan and Eastern Tombs, and the rotation of new and old security teams. These are all expected to be resolved in the short term. The implementation methods will be carried out separately after consultations with the two commissioners, Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming. Huang is attending the opening ceremony of the third term of the summer military officer training corps and is scheduled to leave Guling for Beijing after the second day of next month, and can return to the north before the tenth. Rumors that the political situation in North China will change after Huang's return to the north are purely fictitious. The Japanese side is currently considering methods for the takeover of Duolun, and a result can be obtained after Huang's return to the north. I will not return to Tianjin for the time being. Minister Gu is discussing with the directors of various bureaus at the business promotion meeting in Ping, so I will go to pay my respects immediately. The rumor of adding a branch line to the Beining Railway was once brewed last year and is now a thing of the past. After I pay my respects to Gu, I will go to pay my respects to He and report everything. Yin also said that the central and local opinions are consistent on the diplomatic issues in North China. (29th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gu Mengyu summoned Yin Tong at Duan Zonglin's residence this afternoon, as well as Li Xiangen, the director of the Yuehan Railway Bureau who arrived in Ping from Beijing today, to inquire in detail about the business improvement situation of the two railways. Yin and others did not leave until 2 p.m. Gu said that the affairs in Ping were largely completed and decided to leave Ping with Ge Guangting next week to inspect Qingji. The issue of the Pinghan reorganization loan has been resolved, and Chen Yanjiong will return to Han after Gu travels south. (29th Special Telegram)</p>

More than 20 people attended, including Wan Fulin, Rong Zhen, Xiao Zhenying, Wang Shuchang, Hu Yukun, Gao Weiyue, He Jingwu, Bao Wenyue, and Bao Yulin, with He Yingqin presiding. Two routine cases were resolved and two reports were made. The meeting adjourned at 11 a.m. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Also Addressed the Officer Corps</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Huiqing and Gu Weijun arrived in Beijing one after another on the 28th and took the Jianghua ship to Gan and then to Lu at 8 a.m. on the 29th to meet Chairman Chiang. (29th Central Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Huiqing and Gu Weijun went to Gan on the morning of the 29th to meet Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang. Before leaving, they told people that this trip was at the invitation of Chairman Chiang to give lectures to the students of the Officer Corps, and to take the opportunity to present the international situation to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang. They will stay in Lu for a short time and then return to the north. Because Yan's old illness has not healed, he plans to return to Tianjin directly after leaving Lu this time for recuperation. As for when the two will go abroad to resume their posts, it has not yet been determined. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun answered questions from reporters. I have long wanted to go to Gan, but it was delayed due to illness. I also received a telegram from Chairman Chiang in Qingdao, inviting me. Whether I will give a speech to the Officer Corps this time is not yet determined. I will return to Nanjing in a few days and then return to Qingdao. I have not been back to the country for long, and many things need to be taken care of. The definite date of resuming my post has not yet been determined. When I was in Qingdao, I lived with Song, a member of the Economic Committee, and we talked a lot, covering a wide range of topics. Our observations were the same, generally speaking, we hoped that the country's future would become stronger. A reporter asked about France's attitude in case of a conflict between Japan and Russia. Gu replied that the newspapers reported that the situation between Japan and Russia was very tense, but it was impossible to know what the actual situation was. Whether the war will break out soon depends on the evolution of the facts. I dare say that any country naturally takes its own interests as a starting point. (29th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Huiqing answered questions from reporters. The content of the conversation with President Wang was nothing more than reporting on the recent international situation, covering a wide range of topics, which is not convenient to disclose. This trip to Lu was at the invitation of Chairman Chiang to speak to the third term of the military training corps. The election of directors of the League of Nations is a vote by various countries, and it is impossible to talk about whether there is any certainty. This directorship is, in principle, a rotating appointment, and must be re-elected every three years. As for the more important cases in this meeting, the number of permanent directors of the Executive Yuan may be increased. The issue of the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations is also on the agenda. If the Soviet Union succeeds in joining the League of Nations, it is difficult to predict whether there will be any changes in the international situation, but it is believed that the prestige and strength of the League of Nations will be more substantial. The arrest of Russian personnel by Japan was only seen in the newspapers, and the details are not very clear. Observing that both countries have interests, they may still be able to tolerate each other for a while, so although the situation is very tense, they will not rush into war. A reporter also asked whether there would be any diplomatic cases at the fifth congress of representatives in November. Yan replied that I am not a party member, so it seems unnecessary to participate in the discussion. Moreover, this meeting mainly discusses domestic issues. I have been abroad for many years and am very unfamiliar with the domestic situation, so I cannot participate in the discussion. I will stay in Lu for a few days and then return to Beijing. My illness has not yet healed, and I still plan to go to Qingdao for recuperation. The weather in Russia is cold and not suitable for a declining body. I hope that the government will select capable people as soon as possible so that I can rest. (29th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Bandit Troops Gathered in Tianjin One After Another</p>
<p>The Tianjin Authorities Arrested Many Pseudo-Officers</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Liu Guitang recently conspired with Han traitors such as Shi Yousan, Ma Shigui, and Hao Peng in a certain concession in Tianjin to disrupt the city's security. Liu Guitang's bandit troops have been secretly gathering in Tianjin from all directions. In recent days, various public security bureaus have repeatedly captured people who look like farmers carrying luggage but hiding guns and ammunition inside. According to their confessions, they were all ordered to come. This morning, the Tianjin security agencies sent out detectives and have already arrested one pseudo-division commander, two regimental commanders, and more than 20 pseudo-officers from Liu Guitang's bandit troops. They are trying to search for the remaining members. The arrested pseudo-division commanders have all confessed to Liu Fei's plan to disrupt Tianjin, but said that a certain country did not agree to this move by Liu and Shi. Liu Guitang is hiding in a certain concession in Tianjin, next door to Shi Yousan's residence, with several plainclothes detectives from a certain concession protecting him in front of his door. The Tianjin security authorities are paying close attention to this matter and have ordered various bureaus and teams to strengthen their defenses. Therefore, the area bordering a certain concession in Nanshi Xikai on the night of the 28th was quite tense. The responsible authorities observed that a certain country is not formally assisting Liu and Shi, and it will not be easy to disrupt the situation. Now that important leaders of the pseudo-troops have been arrested, Liu's plan has failed nineteen times. (29th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Bandits Robbed a Wealthy Household Surnamed Gao</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tangshan Public Security Bureau, in coordination with the Second Security Team of the War Zone, began to implement a citywide inspection on the 28th to prevent villains from hiding inside and causing trouble. (29th Special Telegram) (Tianjin) Several villages in Donggao, Tangshan, suddenly discovered dozens of bandits early on the 27th, who directly broke into the residence of the wealthy household Gao Guofu, overturning boxes and cabinets, and robbing more than 1,000 yuan in property. Before leaving, they kidnapped Gao Ziyunqing. The police and militia heard the news and chased after them but could not catch up. On the 28th, the bandits sent a letter to Gao's family demanding 20,000 yuan for ransom. (29th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Kidnapping bandits have recently occurred in the war zone, using drugs to make cigarettes. Those who smoke them lose consciousness and are taken by the bandits to bandit dens. They are given clean water to drink to wake up, and then they are asked to write letters to their families demanding ransom.

<p>(Beiping) The United Tax Bureau of Ping, Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan has established inspection offices at various passes along the Great Wall in summary. The list of heads of each office has been determined, including Rong Shuqi at Yuguan, Li Mingju at Lengkou, Yang Dian at Xifengkou, and Han Huizeng at Malanguan. Because the special affairs at various passes of the Great Wall are complicated, all the members are selected and transferred from the current heads of other inspection offices. Rong Shuqi has already led his team to prepare and is expected to be established soon. Yang Dian, the head of Xifengkou, has also arrived at the local area and started preparations. Li Mingju and Han Huizeng, the heads of Lengkou and Malanguan, are also on their way. All offices were originally scheduled to be established on September 1st, and are expected to start operating in early September. In the future, the inspection methods will be to inspect export goods according to regulations, and to handle import goods according to the regulations of areas where the unified tax has not been implemented, and to pay supplementary taxes separately. In order to be thorough, all customs branches and checkpoints at various passes of the Great Wall will handle supplementary tax matters on behalf of them. (29th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e22">Current Commentary: Prospects for China's Finance After Droughts and Floods 彤 <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Recently, newspapers have carried a message saying, "According to a survey by a certain government agency, the total losses from droughts and floods across the country have exceeded 100 billion yuan. Nearly two-thirds of the country has been affected, including 14 provinces with drought, covering 343 counties, and 13 provinces with floods, covering 12 counties. In addition, there are 68 counties affected by locusts and 89 counties affected by hail." With such a vast disaster area and such serious material and human losses, it seems that a fundamental change in the future development of the national economy is inevitable. In this situation, the most important task at present is to engage in relief. Speaking of relief, it becomes a huge financial problem for the government. Moreover, the impact on finance after such a severe disaster in rural areas across the country is also conceivable. Let us first analyze this impact. First, after a severe disaster, the most affected is of course local finance. Since the establishment of the National Government, the land tax revenue, which was originally a central government contribution, has been changed to an important source of revenue for local governments. This has fostered a close relationship between local finance and land tax revenue. Generally speaking, land tax revenue accounts for about 70% to 90% of the total revenue of various provinces. After the occurrence of droughts and floods, the directly affected areas are the villages that pay land tax. Therefore, it is a huge blow to local finances. Normally, China's local finances are very chaotic. The main reason is naturally the unlimited abuse by local authorities. Just since 1927, the total amount of funds provided to local governments by financial institutions in various places has been no less than 300 million yuan. However, such a large sum of money has been completely wasted by the local authorities. This year's droughts and floods have the fact that they are widely spread across two-thirds of the country. On the one hand, local governments not only lose their main source of revenue, but also want financial institutions in various places to continue to provide financial assistance. I am afraid they will also be disappointed. Just looking at the situation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, although there are rumors that Jiangsu will issue 30 million yuan in bonds, Zhejiang has already been approved by the central government to issue 20 million yuan in bonds, and there is even a proposal to issue them in Shanghai. Given the current difficulties in domestic commercial finance, whether Shanghai has the ability to bear it is still a question.</p>
<p>Second, there is the impact of droughts and floods on central finance. Everyone knows that the main sources of revenue for central finance are customs duties, salt tax, and unified tax. Because these three sources of revenue are the central government's regular revenue and are related to the guarantee of domestic and foreign debts, they are highly valued by people. However, everyone knows that these three sources of revenue are also closely related to the state of agricultural production. Taking customs revenue as an example, the revenue for the first seven months of this year has decreased by about 30 million yuan compared with last year. It is feared that it will shrink even more in the future.</p>
<p>From the above two points, we cannot but admit that the current financial situation is on the verge of a very serious situation. But the most discouraging phenomenon is not in these areas, but in the following two points. First, Shanghai is the financial center of the country. However, any businessman with the goal of "investing capital to seek profit" always has a disregard for investments without guaranteed income. At a time when the country is suffering from severe droughts and floods, rice and flour in Shanghai have become good investment targets. Public bonds for disaster relief are discussed extensively but are not easy to realize. Second, the government has not yet had a good solution for the current droughts and floods. Financial difficulties are naturally the fundamental reason. And a major reason for financial difficulties lies in the major international pressure. In today's accelerating international panic, foreign banks are seen as opportunities, which is frightening. Chinese banks are oppressed and have to be extra vigilant about financial credit. Therefore, the idea of assisting the government to relieve droughts and floods is even more difficult.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that under the pressure of droughts and floods, if we want to find a way out for China's finance,</p>
<p>only by breaking through these two difficulties first will it be possible. Otherwise, it will all be "scratching an itch from outside the boot."</p>

After the parliament passes the new constitution, the new constitution will be implemented quickly. The Governor of India spoke of the complete system of radio broadcasting in India, the important development of civil aviation in the future, and the appointment of commercial commissioners stationed in foreign countries. He also spoke of the sound foundation of the Indo-Japanese Agreement. He also said that efforts are being made to establish a border agreement with China. Finally, he said that refugees from Soviet Russia and Chinese Xinjiang are flocking to India, causing difficulties for India. Expelling them and making them trek through the high mountains of Central Asia would be contrary to humanitarian principles, but allowing them to enter in a continuous stream would also be harmful. The government is currently trying to prevent them from continuing to come and to deal with foreign refugees already in the country. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Treasury Secretary Claims Gold Monetization Profits Offset National Debt</p>
<p>Generally Believed to Indicate Expansionary Policies</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated in a radio broadcast today that the American people have actually spent only $505,000,000 on the "New Deal." He added that since President Roosevelt took office, the government's public debt has increased by $60 billion, but the assets held in the Treasury have also greatly increased as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Profits earned after reducing the gold content of the dollar: $28 billion.</p>
<p>(2) Funds that government relief agencies can recover: $10.95 billion.</p>
<p>(3) Cash currently held in the Treasury: $16 billion.</p>
<p>Morgenthau further stated that the $20 billion in profits from the devaluation of the dollar is currently being used as an exchange stabilization fund. Once it is restored to its proper use in the future, the national debt should be further reduced. Observers generally believe that Morgenthau's statement about using gold monetization profits to offset the national debt indicates expansionary policies, but the Treasury Department vehemently denies this. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated in a radio address that when President Roosevelt took office, the Treasury's reserves were only $200,000,000, but now they have reached $1,800,000,000. In addition, various economic agencies, such as the Farm Credit Administration and the Federal Housing Administration, have their own assets, with a total of $1,095,000,000 in capital. Their loans are all secured and are entirely managed by the government. Combined with the Treasury's reserves, the total reaches approximately $2,800,000,000. Besides these two items, various projects funded by federal treasury funds, such as roads, factories, power plants, and housing, should all be regarded as expansions of national property. Morgenthau continued that most of this $28 billion is cash interest earned by the nation. Morgenthau stated, "This money is temporarily set aside and will eventually be incorporated into other revenues to reduce the national debt." (Havas, 28th)</p>

<p>⊙ Senator Thomas from the New Park District explained Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's radio address to the Associated Press today, stating that it is indeed a form of expansionary policy. Thomas said that the Treasury Secretary's statement about using the profits from the devaluation of the dollar to reduce the national debt indicates how the government will clear its debts. Thomas predicted that the dollar will inevitably fall to 50 cents. Thomas further believed that before the government's relief and recovery plans are completed, the value of the dollar will be further reduced, and the price of gold will rise to $41.34 per ounce. At the same time, the government will purchase gold and issue silver certificates at a price of $1.29 per ounce, a two-pronged approach that could generate another $20 billion in profit. Therefore, expansionary policy has become an inevitable trend. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Some people were shaken by Morgenthau's remarks, believing that they subtly revealed the government's intention to engage in large-scale inflation in order to reduce the national debt. (Havas, 28th)</p>

<p>(New York) Financial figures here commented on the significance of Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's speech, with varying opinions. However, most view inflation as a secondary concern. Some said that Morgenthau's explanation of financial policy was regrettably not thorough enough. They also believe that Morgenthau's intention seems to be to limit government spending and to use the $2,800,000,000 in the Exchange Stabilization Fund as a reserve to issue paper money in order to restore budgetary balance and reduce the debts borne by the Treasury. However, it should be noted that Morgenthau referred to national debt rather than Treasury debt, making the wording somewhat ambiguous. In general, the opinion is that the Exchange Stabilization Fund will not be used until the stability of the international currency exchange market is acceptable to the United States. As for the securities market, Morgenthau's speech will definitely have a positive impact, at least for now. (Havas, 28th)</p>

<p>(London) The London foreign exchange market was quite shaken today as the pound suddenly weakened again, falling to 75.37 against the French franc, a new low since 1924. The U.S. dollar sympathized with the franc, and its price was also strong. The pound was sold off in London this afternoon, and Paris followed suit. British officials did not intervene, leading to a sharp drop in the pound's exchange rate. The reason for the sell-off is difficult to discern, but it is rumored that European operators expect the pound to eventually stabilize at 70 francs. However, London bankers say that any rumors about currency values are premature. Generally, people are quite skeptical about the future trend of the U.S. dollar and anticipate that the pound will inevitably suffer repercussions due to the dollar. This is likely the reason for the pound's weakness. As for the U.S. Treasury Secretary's comments on gold profits, although London and New York do not see it as implying inflation, Europe believes that the statement that gold profits will eventually be used to reduce the national debt does indeed contain inflationary elements.

<p>U.S. Silver Production Decreases Significantly, Mexican Production Increases Slightly</p>
<p>(New York) U.S. silver production decreased significantly in July, with only 1,825,000 ounces, according to figures released by the Metal Statistics Bureau, making it the lowest month since December 1933. June production was 2,312,000 ounces, and July of last year was 1,552,000 ounces. Meanwhile, Mexican silver production increased slightly in July to 6,500,000 ounces, compared to 6,461,000 ounces in June. Canada also produced 1,359,000 ounces, compared to 963,000 ounces in June. Considerable attention is being paid here to the decrease in Shanghai's silver reserves. The statement made by Sir Detring, a leader in the British oil industry, that silver is being shipped out of China to avoid government taxes, is completely disbelieved here. Those familiar with the situation in New York believe that silver is flowing out of China to be sold off in the London market, with perhaps only a few batches being shipped to Hong Kong to avoid taxes.

<p>Russia Denies Recalling Railway Staff</p>
<p>Chinese Eastern Railway Club Closed Down</p>
<p>(Harbin) The commander of the Kwantung Army's Harbin branch sent a document to the Russian representatives of the Chinese Eastern Railway, stating that train accidents on the Chinese Eastern Railway have repeatedly occurred recently, resulting in losses of 370,000 yuan for the Japanese military. This amount will be deducted from the transportation fees paid by the Kwantung Army to the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Kwantung Army believes that the train accidents on the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway were caused by Soviet railway staff colluding with bandits under instructions from the Third International. There is documentary evidence to prove this. (Reuter, 29th) (Moscow) The Japanese news agency Domei reported that the Soviet government is planning to recall all Soviet leaders and staff of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau.

<h3 id="e36">Japanese Naval Policy <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Minister and Navy Minister Reach Agreement</p>
<p>Whether to Demand the Abolition of Naval Treaties</p>
<p>Depends on the Situation at the Preliminary Conference</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that the Minister of the Navy and the Minister of Foreign Affairs have reached an agreement on the policies that Japan will adopt at the London Naval Conference in October. Japan will make proposals in accordance with the spirit of disarmament. Japan hopes that other countries will also propose plans to replace the current ratios. Whether the Washington Naval Treaty will be abolished depends on the outcome of the conference. This statement indicates that the Japanese Navy Ministry has temporarily refrained from demanding the immediate abolition of the treaty. (Reuter, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's draft instruction on naval preparatory negotiations is scheduled to be formally decided at the cabinet meeting on the 31st of this month. If it cannot be decided on that day, it will be decided at the cabinet meeting on the 4th of next month. (Japan United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government plans to decide on the fundamental policy for next year's naval disarmament conference by the cabinet meeting no later than September 7th. Judging from the Navy's consistent position, it strongly advocates that the unequal treaty of the Washington and London treaties on ratios cannot achieve a sense of national defense security and reduce expenses, which are the greatest goals of disarmament. Therefore, it is necessary to declare theoretically and substantially the reason why it cannot contribute to maintaining world peace. Countries should minimize armaments to the greatest extent within the scope of self-defense and recognize the principle of equal armament rights, reaching a new agreement in which countries have more than enough for defense and not enough for offense. Therefore, its position is based on the following foundations: (1) Abolish the Washington and London treaties, which stipulate the ratio system for different types of ships with differential holdings, recognize the freedom of shipbuilding based on the principle of total tonnage, and establish equal and non-discriminatory armament rights. (2) Stipulate the maximum limit of the total tonnage of naval power that each country can possess, and each country, within its scope, should consider its national power and determine its actual holdings. At the same time, each country should be free to build the necessary types of ships. (3) Stipulate the maximum tonnage of warships and the maximum number of cannons that each country can possess for each type of ship. (4) Reduce the holdings of countries with high-level armaments and agree on armaments that cannot attack other countries, etc. If the nations approve of the above approach, Japan can reduce its total tonnage, that is, reduce the quantity, and reduce the ship guns of each type of ship, that is, reduce the quality, both of which are reduced within the scope of self-defense. To oppose the disarmament of this ratio-based system and propose a new approach, Japan advocates giving notice of the abolition of the Washington Treaty at an appropriate time before December 31st.

<p>Part of the Force Rebellious Against Command</p>
<p>Protracted Fighting Within Barracks</p>
<p>⊙ A portion of the Home Guard stationed at the barracks in the Floridsdorf suburb of Vienna rebelled against the commander-in-chief today, leading to conflicts with those in the same camp who remained loyal. The fighting continued until a large number of police entered the camp and arrested numerous individuals, at which point the fighting ceased. Both sides used sticks, bayonets, and pistols as weapons, fighting for over an hour, resulting in many injuries. One side belonged to the Lower Austrian Home Guard under the command of Prince Starhemberg, and opposed the supreme command of Major Pfeffer, claiming that Pfeffer was not working to achieve the Home Guard's objectives. The other side directly belonged to Major Pfeffer's Vienna Home Guard. After the incident broke out, a large detachment of police, wearing helmets and carrying rifles with fixed bayonets, arrived at the barracks in open-topped motorcycles. Order was quickly restored. The police are currently guarding the barracks and nearby key points, and have deployed machine guns in several locations. While there were rumors that the police clashed with the Home Guard while restoring order in the camp, this has been denied by semi-official sources. Floridsdorf is a district of Vienna with a high concentration of workers. In February of this year, socialists and government forces engaged in fierce battles in this district. (Reuter, 28th)</p>

<p>⊙ Vienna experienced renewed bloodshed today as police suddenly searched a Home Guard barracks and arrested over twenty Home Guard personnel. The police force consisted of fifty officers who engaged in a brief struggle with the Home Guard during the search. The police department is unwilling to discuss the truth about this sudden action against the direct forces of Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg. However, reliable sources indicate that it was caused by a continuing conspiracy by the National Socialist Party. It is said that many members of the National Socialist Party have recently joined the Home Guard in order to inform the party leaders about the situation in the military. Another account states that the Home Guard held strong opinions with Socialists, mutually denouncing each other for being friendly with the National Socialists, so the police decided to take fair action and purge both parties equally.

<p>(Berlin) Today's National Socialist Party newspaper revealed numerous letters from voters who opposed the Hitler government, explaining why they cannot trust the National Socialist system. One woman said that her husband, a member of the Stormtroopers, has long work hours every day and does not return until one o'clock in the morning, and is drunk as a lord at least twice a week, which is his custom. Therefore, she has not only not benefited from joining the Stormtroopers, but often feels the reality of empty hands, because most of her husband's monthly income is used for what he considers to be improper pleasures and does not pay for household expenses. Another person believes that Hitler's running a kilometer or two is not significant. Germany has fallen to a third-rate country and must now beg for friendship from Poland. This is indeed the most important fact. Another woman claims to be a Christian and currently sees that the new movement of the German church is no different from the Bolshevikism of Soviet Russia. The newspaper advocates that the National Socialist Party authorities should conduct a fair self-examination and try to remedy the situation. (National Social News, 28th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The correspondent of "La Liberté" in Warsaw wired that "According to credible sources, in addition to the non-aggression treaty between Poland and Germany, there is also a secret political agreement. "La Liberté" reported with complete reservation that Germany seems to recognize that Poland's access to the Baltic Sea is vital to its existence and suggests that Poland and Lithuania implement political integration. If this point is realized, Germany will abandon all its demands on the Memel harbor. If Poland has a military conflict with Lithuania, Germany will not make special demands either. In order to achieve this peacefully, Germany allows it to use its power to help Poland's policies from now on. Once the joint policy is established, Poland will give up the corridor and the city of Gdynia to Germany. Poland will not oppose the return of the Free City of Danzig to Germany. As for the economic agreement, it stipulates that Poland exchanges food for German manufactured products and chemicals, which is completely based on mutual principles. In addition, there are special clauses in wartime. Memel Harbor used to belong to Germany, but is a place that Poland and Lithuania must fight for. The Paris Peace Treaty was placed under the management of the League of Nations. After Lithuania rose up and occupied it in January 1923, it obtained the permission of the Paris Conference of Ambassadors and became the owner of the country. In June of this year, the Lithuanian government dismissed Schleibe, the administrative director of the area, leading to a dispute with Germany. See the telegram of June 29.

Gluderwind also attended, and talks continued until 2:55 PM. The pottery issue was resolved with the decision for Japan to disband its import association and the Dutch East Indies to discontinue its pottery import restriction order. However, the Dutch East Indies side needs to submit this decision to the National Council for approval, so both delegations are keeping it extremely secret. Furthermore, the Japanese side has agreed to cease shipments. As usual, at the request of the Dutch side, the contents of the talks will not be announced. However, it is reported that the Japanese side prioritized the pottery issue for discussion, leading to its resolution.

<p>Major Strike to Begin on the First of Next Month</p>
<p>Involving 820,000 Workers</p>
<p>(New York) Hopes faded today for averting a general strike of 600,000 textile workers across the country, scheduled for around Saturday. Textile industry regulators told the American Federation of Labor tonight that employers have indicated that workers' demands for increased wages and reduced working hours must be resolved through industry regulators, which the workers oppose. With both sides taking extreme positions, a major strike appears inevitable. (28th Kokumin dispatch) (Washington) The textile strike is set to begin on September 1st, involving 825,000 workers. The Director of the National Labor Mediation Board, Garyson, issued a letter today inviting leaders of both labor and management in the cotton textile industry to attend a meeting on Thursday. The workers' strike committee has accepted the invitation but stated that a general strike can only be averted if employers make substantial concessions. Strike Committee Chairman Gorman said that textile mills in Alabama have been transformed into fortresses, equipped with machine guns and tear gas. However, the factory side strongly denies this. Since workers announced their intention to strike if their demands were not met, numerous attempts at mediation have been made, but to no avail. It is widely believed that if the demands of the American Federation of Textile Workers are not accepted by employers, a strike will inevitably occur, as the American Federation of Labor is now backing it.

<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the restoration of the Confucius ritual, this year the National Government dispatched representatives to Qufu to pay respects and visit the tomb for the first time. The ceremony was extremely grand. Central National Government representatives Chu Minyi and Ye Chucang, etc., arrived in Qufu from Beijing on the 26th and returned to Yanzhou that evening.

<p>In front of the statue of the First Teacher in the Dacheng Hall were displayed the following: in the front row were the Bian and Dou sacrificial vessels, followed by the Tailao, then the Five Offerings, and finally the Ten Offerings. All were Zhou Dynasty sacrificial instruments, including the Zhou Kui Feng Dou, Zhou Bao Fu, Zhou Bo Yi, Zhou Xi Zun, Zhou Ya Zun, Zhou Tao Yan, Zhou Pan Kui Dun, Zhou Four-Legged Li, Zhou Ce You, and Zhou Wood Ding. Next were the Five Styles. Ye Chucang presented a pair of wreaths inscribed "In Memory of the Birthday of the First Teacher Confucius," signed "Respectfully presented by Ye Chucang, Special Envoy of the National Government." In front were sandalwood censers. Eight rows of dancers were set up on the platform outside the hall, with sixty-four musicians and dancers in charge of their respective duties. Ancient music was displayed outside the hall, including the ancient Te Qing, golden bells and jade chimes, Bo Zhong, Zu Gu, Tian Gu, Tao Gu, and Bo Fu Gu, one of each; six qin and four se. There were also two Hui flags and one Wu Tong each. The dance flute had more than twenty sections. The two officiating personnel were dressed in purple flower ritual robes with black-edged square scarves and hats. The Hui flags were divided into two types: the ascending dragon flag was used to start the music, and the descending dragon flag and the Wu Tong were used to stop the music. However, only a few instruments could be played, such as the Zhong Lu, Qin Se, Zhu Fou, etc., which no one could play anymore, and were almost extinct.</p>

<p>After the representatives paid their respects, Kong Decheng, the Duke Yansheng, gave a written speech of thanks. The original text reads: "Decheng is now deeply grateful to the National Government's Five Yuans and various ministries, the Shandong Provincial Government, the heads of the Departments of Civil Affairs and Education, and all the officials who have come from afar to pay respects. The doctrines of the First Sage have been popular for more than two thousand years and are known to all, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. Decheng dares not boast. Since the founding of the Republic of China, there have been internal troubles and external threats, and wars have been frequent. The ceremony of respecting the First Sage has not been held. Today, I am honored by the presence of all the officials in Qufu. I think that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People quote the First Sage a great deal, which is to respect the First Sage. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek promotes the New Life Movement and emphasizes the old morality, which is to respect the First Sage. Chairman Han Fuju has also proposed repairing the Confucius Temple, which is to respect the First Sage. In the future, there will be harmony and admiration both at home and abroad. I congratulate the future of the Republic of China, and I congratulate the National Government and the Provincial Government."</p>

<p>After the public ceremony, the family ritual was held, presided over by Kong Decheng, the 77th generation descendant of Confucius. The rest of the family members stood on both sides of the central aisle of the incense burner in front of the apricot altar. The musicians and dancers held shields and feathers in the center of the platform. There were four masters of ceremonies, one inside and one outside the hall, and one in front of the apricot altar.

<p>After the ceremony, they took cars to Confucius' Tomb. At twelve o'clock, the tomb visiting ceremony was held. Eight dishes were placed on the stone table at Confucius' tomb.

<p>The current Duke Yansheng Kong Decheng is the 77th generation descendant of Confucius. He is fifteen years old and extremely intelligent. It is said that his family is currently managed by his aunt. He has two elder sisters, one married to Ke Yanling in Beiping and one married to the son of Feng Shu. He has finished reading the Four Books and is currently studying the Confucian Classics, and also learning arithmetic, history, geography, and other subjects.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Confucius Mansion Banquet <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Confucius Mansion held a banquet to entertain guests from all over. Kong Decheng hosted a separate banquet for representatives from the Central Government and the Provincial Government. During the banquet, Kong Lingcan, a representative of the Kong family (Chief of the First Section of the Education Department), reported the difficulties of the Confucius Mansion to Vice Minister of the Interior Fu Rulin. Initially, Confucius' sacrificial land was 100,000 hectares, but now most of it does not pay rent. He requested that it be restored in order to honor the sacrificial rituals. Fu agreed to find a way to maintain it and asked the Confucius Mansion to send a detailed list of the land to the ministry for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Confucius Mansion Garden <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The residence of the Duke Yansheng, called the Duke's Mansion, occupies a large area. Many close relatives of the Kong family live here. Due to the recent decline in the Kong family's fortunes, the Duke's Mansion has been unable to make ends meet and its debts have been increasing. This national ritual held by the Central Government was unexpected by the Kong family and was considered a great honor. According to the Kong family, the iron tree in the Duke's Mansion garden suddenly bloomed this year, and the lights in front of the Duke's Mansion suddenly became bright, which is a sign of the revival of Confucianism. Because this year's events were rushed, not many Kong family members came from various places. It is expected that the number will increase next year. The garden behind the Duke's Mansion is elegantly decorated, with artificial mountains, pavilions, pools, and many flowers and trees, all of which are ancient. There are more than ten pots of cacti, as tall as a person, and there are also iron magnetic seedlings. After the representatives finished the ceremony at the Confucius Temple, they returned to the Duke's Mansion to rest, and Kong Decheng and the Duke's Mansion receptionists led them to visit the garden and took several motion pictures.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Plainclothes Troops Discovered in Yutian, Hebei Province <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>More than a Hundred People with Complete Firearms</p>
<p>Authorities Pay Attention to Prevention</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Yutian Security Team's commander, the issue of the team's reduction to a thousand men, and all disputes in the war zone must wait for Huang Fu to return and negotiate with the Japanese side, so they cannot be resolved immediately. Before these issues are resolved, it was suddenly reported that plainclothes troops were discovered near Tuanshanzi in Yutian. According to inquiries, on the 24th of this month, several hundred troops suddenly appeared between Fengrun, Jixian, and Zunhua counties, occupying villages. They claimed that they were not bandits, but plainclothes troops under the command of a certain unofficial military figure. People saw that the team's firearms were well-equipped and dared not neglect it, so they were prepared to treat them with courtesy. The matter was heard by the commander of the Third Battalion of the Security Team stationed in Jixian County, who rushed to lead his troops there. However, the team claiming to be plainclothes troops fled without a trace upon hearing the news. The next morning, more than a hundred so-called plainclothes troops also appeared in Wangtian Tuanshanzi, dressed in disheveled clothes, but all were fully equipped with firearms. They hid in the mountains, planning to do something. On the same day, Yin Rugeng happened to come to Tianjin to visit Yu Xuezhong to request instructions on the takeover of Majiagao and road construction in the war zone. He received a report from the Yutian County Magistrate and immediately went to the Provincial Government to report to Yu. Yu immediately telegraphed the Yutian Security Team to take strict precautions. However, after the telegram was sent, the province was not sure whether the Security Team would follow the order. Therefore, it also telegraphed the neighboring Jixian, Zunhua, and Fengrun counties to step up their precautions. As of today, there has been no news, so it is thought that the plainclothes troops, seeing that there was no opportunity to take advantage of, have turned to other places. On the day that plainclothes troops were discovered in Yutian, a disheveled team also appeared in the San Nü'er River in Fengrun County, numbering about eighty. They claimed to be subordinates of Liu Zuozhou, of the First General Team of the Security Forces in the war zone stationed in Luanxian County, and were ordered to go out to suppress bandits. The team had more than fifty large guns and more than ten pistols, and the rest were unarmed. Although the San Nü'er River Police Station suspected the team, they did not dare to act rashly. On the one hand, they looked for lodgings and provided food and drink, and on the other hand, they secretly reported to the County Government. After the County Government forwarded the report to Liu Zuozhou's headquarters in Luanxian County, they received a reply stating that no team had been sent out to suppress bandits. County Magistrate Zhang Renli immediately secretly ordered the San Nü'er River Police Station to find a way to confiscate the firearms of the bandit team. The police, due to their small numbers, planned to use persuasive methods to make the team abandon their weapons and flee. The bandits refused to listen and retreated to Zhangzhuangzi, where they relied on the terrain to confront the police. A fierce battle broke out that day. County Magistrate Zhang Renli received the news and led the police team to assist on the evening of the 25th. After a half-day of fierce fighting, the bandits were defeated and scattered in all directions. It is said that the bandits were also plainclothes troops ordered to operate in Fengrun. The source of these plainclothes troops is said to be that Shi Yousan recently went to Changchun to ask the Japanese and puppet sides to give him a title so that he could operate in North China. The Japanese side, seeing that all recent negotiations had been successful and that everything in North China could be taken at will, refused the request because they felt that there was no need to organize a group for Shi Yousan. Shi returned to Tianjin disgruntled and recruited Ma Henggui, who was hiding in the puppet capital (Ma was the leader of the plainclothes troops in the former Tianjin Incident), and recruited the remaining troops of Zhang Haipeng's army in Rehe along the Great Wall line to form plainclothes troops in the war zone, planning to cause disturbances. Therefore, the authorities are paying close attention to this and are urgently seeking ways to prevent it. (26th)</p>

<p>Xiao Ke Plans to Flee from Western Hunan into Sichuan and Guizhou</p>
<p>Under the Pursuit of the Large Army, He is Already Heavily Besieged</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The bandits being suppressed by the Western Route Army were originally the troops of Kong Hechong, Gao Yongsheng, Cai Huiwen, Yu Xingzhou, Xiao Ke, etc., with Xiao's troops being the most fierce. For more than a year, the Western Route Army has successively broken through the bandit nests in western Jiangxi, and completely recovered the counties occupied by the bandits. The various troops of Kong, Gao, Cai, and Yu have all been successively eliminated. Only Xiao Ke's pseudo-Eighteenth Division remains, hiding in Faxin Mountain in Yongxin. The unit is surrounded and suppressed by the *Number Removed* Column, causing the bandit area to gradually shrink, with the aim of annihilating them. Because Xiao's bandits were blocked and could not survive, they detoured out of Suichuan through mountain roads, taking advantage of the situation to invade southern Hunan, passing through Rucheng, Guidong, Zixing, Xintian, Guiyang, and other counties, and reaching Yongzhou. The journey took only a week, with daily rapid marches of more than a hundred *li*, specifically detouring along small roads to avoid contact with the army corps. Currently, Xiao's bandits number about ten thousand, with three to four thousand guns, and have gathered on the east bank of the Xiang River and Xiao River, between Lingling, Qiyang, Xintian, and other counties, attempting to cross the west bank, go out of Wubao, pass through western Hunan, and enter Sichuan and Guizhou to join forces with He Long's bandits. The armies of the three provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi have gathered on the west bank of the Xiang River and are divided into three parts: "pursuit," "blockade," and "interception," advancing towards the bandits at the same time. Xiao's bandits are indeed trapped in an important encirclement, and it is expected that the armies from all sides will reach the concentration point within three or four days, and will immediately launch a fierce attack on Xiao's bandits.

<h3 id="e120">Anhui Province Handling Famine Relief <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Borrowing Funds from Banking Circles to Stabilize Grain Prices</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Purchase Drought-Resistant Seeds</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Since the flood in Anhui Province in the 20th year of the Republic, the rural economy has collapsed, and households have few savings. This summer's unusual drought has caused a disaster, and the people are feeling particularly difficult to obtain food. The Department of Construction has recently received representatives from various counties, requesting relief. The Department stated that the government is already planning as a whole, and local areas should also urgently seek self-help, and instructed them to pay attention to this. However, the representatives all stated that they were planning to urgently stabilize grain prices, but it was difficult to raise funds, and requested that the Department introduce them to banks for loans. The Department then sent Secretary Fang Junqiang to contact various banks. Most of the bank managers were away on other business, so he consulted with Zhou, the manager of the Anqing branch of the Shanghai Commercial Bank. According to his proposal: (1) The use of the loan is limited to stabilizing grain prices; (2) For every 10,000 yuan borrowed, the local area must also raise 2,000 yuan on its own to combine with the grain, in order to offset losses. If they want to borrow more, the same principle applies; (3) The income and expenditure of stabilizing grain prices will be supervised by personnel sent by the bank; (4) No collateral is required; (5) The loan interest rate and repayment period will be decided by the head office. The representatives from various counties also believe that this is fair and sufficient to stabilize grain prices and provide famine relief. Currently, the bank has requested instructions from its Shanghai head office, and it can be decided and implemented within a few days. However, the Department of Construction believes that the disaster area this year is too wide and there are many starving people. Stabilizing grain prices is only one of various relief measures, and it is not possible to rely solely on its success. It is necessary to also plan other forms of assistance. Yesterday, it specially telegraphed the Provincial Government, requesting that it forward the matter to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and promptly instruct the Farmers Bank of the Four Provinces to refer to the agreed-upon proposal and allocate loans to meet urgent needs. The Department also believes that the drought area in Anhui Province has reached 48 counties, so it has made repeated efforts in water diversion projects to provide irrigation, and has supervised various counties to quickly purchase drought-resistant and short-term crop seeds such as buckwheat, green beans, and turnips, and distribute them to disaster-stricken farmers for timely planting. It has also sent technicians to Shanghai, Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, Bengbu, and Congyang to purchase more than 10,000 yuan worth of seeds such as buckwheat, potatoes, turnips, and rapeseed, and has telegraphed various counties to prepare the price and send personnel to collect them to supplement the shortage. All counties north of the Anhui River are designated to collect them from Bengbu, and counties in central and southern Anhui are designated to collect them from Anqing and Wuhu, respectively. As of recently, the number of seeds requested by various counties is as follows: more than 2,600 *shi* of buckwheat, more than 200 *shi* of potatoes, more than 40 *shi* of turnips, and more than 20 *shi* of rapeseed. The amount of seeds that have been successively distributed is as follows: more than 400 *shi* of buckwheat and 300 *shi* of potatoes. The rest will be distributed after the purchased seeds are transported. It has already telegraphed the various purchasing committees to purchase them day and night and distribute them separately, and to complete this by the end of the month. At the same time, it has stipulated the methods for various counties to distribute seeds and has compiled methods for planting potatoes, strictly ordering them to follow the guidance, in order to provide some relief to the disaster-stricken farmers in the drought area.

<p>The Department of Civil Affairs Sends Personnel to Songjiang to Investigate</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the administration of policies, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs believes that there is a separation between the department and the county districts, and has specially commissioned investigators to investigate the counties within the supervisory area separately. Investigator Wang Muzeng was ordered to come to Songjiang yesterday. This morning, he went to the County Government to visit County Magistrate Jin and investigate everything. In the afternoon, he went to the First District Office, where District Chief Li Yan welcomed him. Investigator Wang conducted a rigorous investigation of district administration, such as population, area, expenses, local undertakings, and the township chiefs, deputy township chiefs, and police, etc. The investigation lasted about two hours. It is said that he will stay in Songjiang for several days to investigate the local customs and conditions.</p>

<p>He Zhuoran, a policeman from the Xinqiao Police Station, 27 years old, from Hunan Province, allegedly at 3:00 a.m. last night, while the tofu shop in the town was grinding tofu, Song Ren, the shop owner's wife, ordered her daughter A Yin, 22 years old, to go to the West Market to call for her uncle. When A Yin returned and passed by an alley next to the tavern set up by Zhu Huanzhang, she was restrained and raped by He. The woman struggled and screamed for help, which was heard by her mother. When she went to look, A Yin had been pushed into the river by Police Officer He. She was rescued by someone and He was captured. A Yin's clothes were soaked and she lost one shoe. Song Ren was very unwilling, so she took He Zhuoran to the police station and sent a document to Songjiang today to be investigated and prosecuted according to the law.</p>

<p>Anhui Fellow Villagers Association Accuses Inspector Du</p>
<p>Cheng Gongjian, an Anhui native living in the Vinegar Warehouse Alley, was involved in a case of smoking opium and abusing a maid. The District Procuratorate repeatedly summoned Cheng, but he did not appear. Later, it was learned that Cheng was hiding in the home of his mother-in-law, Tian Wang, on Pingqiao Straight Street. Prosecutor Du Jiasheng led the police to go there, but to no avail. At that time, Tian Wang suddenly clashed with the judge, and Prosecutor Du accused Tian Wang of obstructing official duties, handcuffed her and returned to the court. Although she was released on bail, Tian Wang's wrist was injured by the handcuffs. She obtained a medical certificate from the doctor and reported it to the Anhui Fellow Villagers Association in Suzhou, requesting assistance. After the association sent someone to investigate, they believed that Tian Wang was a woman and had no ability to resist, so how could she obstruct official duties? Since they could not find the hidden criminal, they believed that Prosecutor Du was abusing his power. The Fellow Villagers Association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the Supreme Court, requesting that they be investigated according to the law.</p>

<p>River Water is Cut Off and There are Few Measures to Save the Drought</p>
<p>The section of the river from Qinglong Bridge on East Street to Wubu Bridge on West Street in Zhangjingqiao, District 6, has long been cut off, and river traffic has also been cut off as a result. Fortunately, there are still few fields in the middle, so it has little impact on irrigation. Although the river water has not been cut off in the nearby Northeast Tang area, the river water in Chenjiaqiao, Huangtutang, and other places has also been cut off, so the water source for the farmland in the Northeast Tang area has also been cut off at both ends. Although there are water-scooping boats, they cannot do anything. If it does not rain, the rice will definitely dry up and die. The township chiefs and local people in the two places have repeatedly held meetings to discuss the matter, but because of a lack of funds, they have not been implemented. They can only watch the rice dry and die.</p>

<p>This year's drought has caused the mulberry leaves to wither, which has a significant impact on autumn sericulture. The county's sericulture model area was originally allocated 230,000 sheets of autumn silkworm eggs by the Department of Construction, but now only more than 110,000 sheets have been determined. According to the budget, this is only half of the original amount. Therefore, the Department of Construction has specially telegraphed various districts to reduce and consolidate the guidance centers established according to the original plan. After receiving the order, Cai Jingde, the Deputy Director of the county's sericulture model area, went to the province yesterday to visit Director Shen to ask for instructions on everything. He returned to Wuxi that night. According to reports, the county has already decided on the principle of reducing and consolidating, but how to start the reduction and consolidation depends on the local situation in each village. In addition, the county's Silkworm Seed Trade Association held a meeting yesterday and resolved to ask the Department of Construction to pay the price of non-acid-treated silkworm eggs immediately, and appointed Jiang Jiayou and Hou Shuzhi as representatives to go to the province to petition.</p>

<p>The Bandit Situation in the Fifth District is Rampant Again</p>
<p>In the recent past, the bandit situation in the fifth district of this county has become rampant again. Several hundred bandits are entrenched in places like Da Li Township and Tan Jia Fort near Linze. They are powerful, have many firearms, and kidnap and rob people at night. Some of the bandits are wearing military uniforms. Li Yingpei and his son from Suya Township, along with Li Tianpei, have been kidnapped and are being held for a large ransom. Citizens such as Sun Zhengui have jointly submitted a petition to the Zhenjiang Provincial Security Office and the county government, requesting that troops be sent immediately to suppress the bandits and secure the area.</p>

<p>Recent News on the Agricultural Bank Embezzlement Case</p>
<p>After the Jiaxing County Farmers Bank discovered the theft of more than 40,000 yuan on the morning of the 15th of this month, embezzlement was discovered in the accounts. Xu Fukang, the cashier director, and Tu Yiran, a bank employee, were sent to court for investigation. Manager Wu Qishu fled in fear of punishment. The bank's board of supervisors decided to offer a reward of 1,000 yuan for his arrest. They are currently organizing the accounts and hiring accountants to audit them. Furthermore, the bank has never published its accounts or issued stocks since its establishment, causing much discontent among the farmers. Yesterday, the county farmers association held a meeting, believing that the bank's capital was entirely the hard-earned money of the farmers, and that the manager's embezzlement resulted in a huge loss of funds. It was resolved to petition the county government to strictly order the guarantors to compensate the full amount and to verify the exact amount of the bank's capital and issue stocks to protect the farmers' hard-earned money and demonstrate government credibility.</p>

<p>Rice Prices Gradually Decline</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the rice produced this year in various regions has been affected by drought, resulting in reduced harvests. People are deeply concerned about food. However, local governments are now making every effort to seek relief. In addition, there has been timely rainfall in various regions, so rice prices have eased slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Showers Yesterday <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Starting at 12:30 PM yesterday, the city experienced showers. Although it was not long, Jiangwan and other places in the city received more rain and for a longer period. As these areas are mostly farmland, it will be of great benefit to the crops. Therefore, yesterday's rice prices were even lower than the previous day. According to the astronomical observatory, there will be more showers in the next few days.</p>

<p>According to investigations by reporters with relevant parties, except for Hunan and Anhui provinces, which are self-sufficient, other provinces such as Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi need to rely on external sources. Jiangxi Province, in particular, needs more rice due to the presence of large troops for bandit suppression. However, the authorities in Jiangxi have already purchased and stockpiled a large amount of rice, so there may be no panic for the time being. The authorities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hubei provinces are planning to negotiate with the banking sector to regulate food supply through loans or investments. The Zhejiang authorities plan to purchase rice from Wenzhou and Taizhou in southern Zhejiang, where there was a good harvest this year. If this is not enough, they will purchase from Fujian, as Fujian also had a good harvest this year. Hubei and Jiangsu provinces plan to purchase foreign rice. The banking sector is said to be very sympathetic to this matter, and there should be no problems.</p>

<p>According to those familiar with the conditions in various rice-producing areas, the drought this year is not as severe as rumored. Moreover, there has been timely rainfall in the Yangtze River basin, which is beneficial to the autumn harvest. Therefore, rice prices have begun to decline. In this city, the market price the other day fell by four or five jiao. If the rain continues, prices may not exceed the authorities' price limit.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Sha Hansheng Discusses the Current Situation of Overseas Chinese in Brazil <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Going to Beijing This Morning to Report to the Central Government</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Sha Hansheng, Secretary of the Chinese Embassy in Brazil and Standing Committee Member of the Kuomintang Branch in Brazil, arrived in Shanghai on the German ship "Fu Er Te" on the 26th to report on the recent situation of overseas Chinese affairs and party affairs in Brazil. He is scheduled to go to Beijing on the morning of the 30th to report to the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited him at his residence yesterday morning. According to his discussion, the situation of overseas Chinese in Brazil is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e140">Over a Thousand Overseas Chinese <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>According to Sha, there are more than 1,300 overseas Chinese in Brazil, mostly from Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces. The Cantonese overseas Chinese are mostly laborers, such as those working in restaurants and laundries. They have a significant influence in the labor community in northern Brazil. The Zhejiang overseas Chinese are mostly merchants, selling goods such as porcelain and embroidery. The cost of living in Brazil is relatively low, so they are still relatively affluent. However, the amount they can remit back to China is very small because the value of Brazilian currency is lower than that of any other country.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Party Affairs Progress <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Kuomintang in Brazil only had a liaison office in the Brazilian capital before 1932 due to various reasons. After 1932, it was changed to the Kuomintang branch in Brazil. Since then, party affairs have gradually progressed. In November of last year, it was changed to the Kuomintang Branch directly under the Central Government in Brazil. It has spared no effort in promoting party affairs, so there are already more than 200 official party members. Among the remaining overseas Chinese, 80 to 90 percent are probationary party members who can all believe in and practice the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Sino-Brazilian Trade <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Regarding trade between China and Brazil, the main Chinese goods shipped to Brazil in recent years are tea and porcelain. However, the operators are not Chinese, but foreigners. The business situation is also deteriorating year by year. This is because Brazil is strongly promoting its own goods within the country, and they are very cheap. Foreign goods entering the country are subject to restrictions, so business is declining day by day. The Brazilian government provides strong protection for the safety of overseas Chinese and there have been no anti-Chinese incidents, so overseas Chinese can live and work in peace.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Supplementary Chinese Language Lessons <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Most of the overseas Chinese in Brazil go there as adults, and most are from the working class. Therefore, few have studied Chinese characters. Some are illiterate and cannot communicate. Therefore, the Kuomintang Branch directly under the Central Government in Brazil and the Chinese Association have established supplementary schools at night. The results have been good since their establishment. Sha continued to say that there are many children of overseas Chinese in Brazil, but there are no formal Chinese schools, which is a cause for concern.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Going to Beijing This Morning <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Sha finally stated that he has lived in Brazil for more than ten years and has not returned to China for a long time, so he has requested a four-month leave to return to China. In addition to inspecting the situation in China, he also needs to report on the situation of party affairs and overseas Chinese affairs in Brazil to the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He is scheduled to take the early train to Beijing tomorrow morning (today). As for Xiong Chongzhi, the Chinese Minister to Brazil, he has not indicated that he will return to China.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Customs Administration Ordered the Customs to Release the Detained Zhang Rice Yesterday <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Grain Association Submitted a Letter of Guarantee</p>
<p>According to the Shin Shih News Agency, about 30,000 bags of Zhang rice, transported to Shanghai by Xiamen rice merchants, have been offered to various parties for sale in Shanghai. Customs officials, suspecting that Fujian Province was not a rice-producing area, questioned where such a large amount of rice came from and ordered its detention for inspection. After half a month of negotiations, Shen Shuyu, the Director of the Customs Administration, ordered the Customs to release the rice yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e148">Zhang Rice Detained in Shanghai <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Zhangzhou has a large amount of rice, which has never been sold in Shanghai because it was needed by the province. Since the taxation of foreign rice last year, domestic rice has sold well and is easier to sell than before. Xiamen rice merchants purchased a large amount of new rice from Zhangzhou when it came on the market and transported it to Shanghai for trial sales. On the 2nd of this month, 130 bags were shipped to Shanghai by 16 Xiamen rice shops, including De Tai, Jin Rui, Hui Long, and Fu Yuan. Subsequently, several thousand bags were shipped by boat. However, this Zhang rice was collected from the countryside, and the quality and color were not uniform. Shanghai rice merchants had never seen it before. At a time when various provinces were suffering from drought and demand was high, the first several thousand bags were sold out, with substantial profits. Therefore, Xiamen was telegraphed to continue shipping rice to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the rice was suspected by customs officials and detained for inspection. Seven or eight ships en route were detained one after another, totaling more than 30,000 bags. All were temporarily stored in customs warehouses and not released.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Customs Inspection Difficult to Decide <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>After detaining the rice, the Customs collected various types of domestic and foreign rice from the Grain Association for comparison and research. It also submitted it to the Tax Commissioner of the Verification Office for testing by experts in the chemical testing room, but without any results. It also ordered the Xiamen Customs to investigate the Zhang rice producing area and submit samples for detailed investigation. The Xiamen Customs samples arrived on the 26th and were compared and tested by experts. The composition of the rice was similar in various places, with no significant difference. It could not be determined whether it was foreign rice. Finally, Bode, the Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, submitted a request to the Inspector General of Customs, Bland, for a final decision. After careful comparison and research, Bland felt that although the rice could not be determined to be foreign rice, it had a significant difference in color, size, and pointiness from the rice produced in Rangoon, Saigon, Taiwan, Korea, and Japan. However, because rumors were rife and there were reports of mixing it with domestic rice, he could not make an immediate decision on how to resolve the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Association Guarantees Release <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Many parties proved that the Zhang rice should be released, such as the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong rice merchants, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Grain Association, and the Zhangquan Association. They sent letters and telegrams to the Jianghai Customs to prove it. The Xiamen Customs also sent personnel to conduct an on-site investigation and telegraphed the Customs to prove its release. Yesterday, the Grain Association also sent personnel to the Customs Administration to petition. Director Shen Shuyu was in Shanghai and listened to the petitioners present the details of the situation. He also stated that the new Zhangzhou rice had a high moisture content and would ferment and rot if stored in customs warehouses for a long time. He asked for consideration for the merchants' blood money. After listening to the petition, Director Shen immediately called Bland of the Review and Verification Department and asked him to release the rice immediately if there was no sufficient evidence. After receiving the call, Bland telegraphed the Jianghai Customs to allow the release, but for the sake of caution, the Grain Association was asked to prepare a formal guarantee letter, stating that if it was later found that there was indeed a mixture, the Association would be responsible. The case of detaining the rice, which had been entangled for more than a month, was thus resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Imports of Foreign Rice Increased Sharply in July <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Totaling More Than 3.82 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Most Imports Came From Annam and Siam</p>
<p>This year's floods and droughts have resulted in a sharp decline in harvests. Rice merchants, seeing the potential for profit, have ordered foreign rice in large quantities, resulting in a sharp increase in imports. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency investigated the International Trade Bureau yesterday and learned that the total imports of foreign rice in July amounted to more than 3.82 million yuan, several times higher than the imports in the same month in previous years. Most imports came from Annam and Siam. The import quantities and countries are listed below: Siam 225,736 metric tons, Annam 164,896 metric tons, India 70,632 metric tons, Singapore 1,510 metric tons. According to the declared import prices, the total is more than 3.82 million yuan.</p>

Autumn cocoons are expected to be available on the market by the end of next month.</p>

<h3 id="e154">The Central Government Approved Jiangsu Province to Issue 20 Million Yuan in Public Bonds <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>To Consolidate Old Debt Surplus</p>
<p>To Complete the Huai River Diversion Project</p>
<p>According to Shin Shih News Agency, the Jiangsu Provincial Government decided to issue 30 million yuan in public bonds to develop water conservancy and consolidate old and new debts. It had previously drafted measures and detailed rules and submitted them to the Central Government for approval. The Central Government initially thought that Jiangsu Province had suffered from disasters for years, the market was depressed, and the people were in difficulty, so it planned to reduce the amount of this public bond to 10 million yuan. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Government believed that the established plans were all in urgent need of implementation and could not be reduced further, so it sent the Directors of the Department of Finance and the Department of Civil Affairs to Beijing to explain. As a result, a compromise was reached to allow the issuance of 20 million yuan, which was formally approved by the Central Political Conference yesterday. After being transferred to the Executive Yuan for approval, it can be transferred to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for issuance.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Most of it Will Be Used to Consolidate Old Debts <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The original purpose of this Jiangsu Province's issuance of public bonds was to (1) consolidate old debts of various banks, (2) complete the Huai River Diversion Project, and (3) dredge the new Grand Canal. Now that the originally planned amount has been reduced, the allocation of funds must be slightly changed. According to a reporter's investigation with the Jiangsu Bank, the issuance of this new public bond will be used primarily to repay the old debts of the banking sector. The old debts of the banks in Jiangsu that need to be consolidated amount to about 6 million yuan, with deed tax revenue as collateral. At the same time, there are also 9 million yuan of construction bonds issued in the past, with salt tax surcharges as collateral. The issuance of the above-mentioned public bonds was not formally approved by the Central Government, so it is also necessary to consolidate them urgently.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Only 5 Million for Water Conservancy Development <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Therefore, after the issuance of 20 million yuan in public bonds, 15 million yuan will be transferred to the relevant banks as repayment of the principal and interest of old debts and old public bonds. After the old debts are repaid, the deed tax and salt tax surcharge, which are the collateral for the old debts, will be transferred to the new public bonds to serve as a fund for repayment of principal and payment of interest. The annual income from the deed tax is 1 million yuan, and the annual salt tax surcharge is about 1.8 million yuan, which is more than enough to cover the annual principal and interest of the new debt. The annual interest rate of the new debt has been set at 7 percent, with a term of 20 years. The remaining 5 million yuan will be used to complete the Huai River Diversion Project. The funds for the construction of the new Grand Canal will be raised by the Jiangsu Provincial Government through other means and completed in the short term.</p>
<p>The representatives took the 9:00 AM Beijing-Shanghai express train to leave Shanghai and embark on the journey. The representatives who came to see them off all returned. It is learned that the factory representatives plan to parade and promote the exhibition after arriving in Wuxi, so that all sectors of Wuxi will pay attention to it.</p>

<p>To Prevent Reactionary Elements from Causing Trouble</p>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, September 1 is the anniversary of the Second Congress of the Communist Party held in Chicago, USA. Later, it was designated as a permanent memorial day for the Communist Party. The Chinese Concession Police Authorities are deeply concerned that reactionary elements will take the opportunity to cause trouble and disrupt public order, so they have announced a temporary alert for one day. Wen Hongen, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, has issued a special order to all district offices, ordering them to increase the number of police officers on duty at major roads in each district starting at 5:00 AM, and the detectives of the Supervision Division will also lead plainclothes inspectors to conduct inspections of suspicious pedestrians.

<p>Because She Did Not Find a Chinese Female Comrade</p>
<p>According to the Mainland News Agency, American female aviator Bland arrived in Shanghai on August 11 to seek a Chinese female aviator to establish a branch of the Ninety-Nines club. However, she failed to meet a single Chinese or foreign female aviator in Shanghai, so she quietly boarded the President Adams ship and left for Hong Kong. The lady told a Mainland News Agency reporter, "I did not expect to find many female aviators when I came to Shanghai, but I thought I could find a few. I knew that China had banned private flying, but I had heard of one or two Chinese female aviators when I was in the United States. But after arriving in Shanghai, it seemed that no one knew about them. I have traveled to several countries and have never failed to find a female aviator in a country. This is the first time. I have found them in Cuba, Jamaica, Panama, Hawaii, and Japan. I am going to South China now, and perhaps I can find a few." According to the report, the lady left New York a year ago for a world tour and will need another two years to complete her journey.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Lake Society Petitions the National Government to Promote Domestic Textile Formal Wear <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Memorial Weeks and Ceremonies Require Formal Wear</p>
<p>People's Weddings, Funerals, Celebrations, and Gatherings Must Also Wear Them</p>
<p>The style of formal wear in China has long been stipulated by the Ministry of Interior, but few people follow it. Lake Society of this city is aware that domestic textiles have been declining in recent years, and that people's clothing is uneven, and that they only favor foreign goods. Therefore, Shen Tianxin, the director of the Society's Industrial Department, proposed to petition the National Government, the Military Affairs Commission, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Interior to issue a nationwide order that everyone should follow the prescribed formal wear and use domestic goods to make their clothes proper, promote domestic production, and regulate the people's clothing. The original text is as follows: "We believe that the key to governing a country is to cultivate oneself before managing one's family, and the method of transforming the people is to guide them with virtue and especially to enrich them with etiquette. Clothing that is not correct is a disaster for the body, and frugality and simplicity are the essence of etiquette. Our China has always been known as a land of etiquette and righteousness, and the clothing of the upper kingdom has long shocked foreign customs. Since the reform of the government, the Ministry of Interior has clearly stipulated the formal dress, formal hat, ceremonial dress, and ceremonial hat, and has attached illustrations to explain them, and has ordered all levels of the country to comply with them. Even if they comply with them, they are often not domestic goods. For example, when people have happy events, they wear either Chinese clothes, Western suits, or square jackets and long robes, but the colors are mottled, or short clothes and narrow sleeves, but the forms are strange. They even flaunt their novelty and buy goods from abroad to compete with each other. They ignore the laws and regulations and are ridiculed by friendly countries. Nothing is worse than this. The difference between humans and animals lies in the ability to understand etiquette and love the country. If they cannot understand etiquette, then strange clothes and strange attire will lose the respect of sight. If they do not know how to love the country, then barbarian cloth and Japanese robes will show the overflow of power. In order to implement the new life, our Society intends to petition all provinces to order their subordinates that in the future, (1) when holding memorial weeks and important meetings, and (2) when there are happy or funeral events, they should all wear formal wear, and civil servants, except for the military police, should set an example and order that domestic goods be used for all silk, wool, and cotton textiles used in making formal wear. In this way, clothing can be regulated, and the promotion of textiles will prevent profits from flowing out. The matter concerns the national system and the people's livelihood, and it is reasonable to submit a document for review and implementation, which is of public convenience. Respectfully presented by Chen Qicai, Chairman of the Lake Society Committee."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Yunnan Xinwei Relief Association, noting the recent drought affecting as many as fourteen provinces, has received numerous letters and telegrams to Shanghai requesting aid. Therefore, Wang Yiting, Qu Yingguang, and others from the association sent a telegram to Xu Shiying in Lushan, stating: "To Chairman Xu, No. 16, Banqiao Road, Guling.

<p>Worth Five Thousand Yuan in Foreign Currency</p>
<p>No Trace After Disappearance</p>
<p>Yuan Yu Company, located at No. 4, Lane 244, Ningbo Road, specializes in buying and selling various securities. Yesterday afternoon, around 4:00 PM, the company received a phone call from a client inside the stock exchange, requesting to purchase five thousand yuan worth of Jianghai Customs Revenue Treasury Bonds from the 23rd year of the Republic and instructing them to send them immediately. At the time, the company, considering the client a regular customer, instructed their broker, Wei Zongzhen, a native of Shaoxing, 35 years old, to deliver the bonds. Unexpectedly, at closing time, the company received repeated phone calls from the buyer questioning why the securities had not been delivered. The company informed them that they had already been sent out and, because the broker had always been honest, they had no doubts. However, by late evening, the broker had still not returned to the shop, causing great panic. They searched everywhere, but there was no trace of him. At the same time, the buyer and the stock exchange also claimed not to have seen the broker. Only then did they realize that he had absconded with the bonds. They immediately reported the matter to the police station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Special Survey Record of National Products Industry <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>(2) Electric Light Bulb Industry</p>
<p>In recent years, the promotion of the electrical industry in our country has progressed rapidly, leading to an increasing demand for electrical appliances. Electric light bulbs, as daily necessities in electrical appliances, have the widest application and are most closely related to people's lives. In recent years, the concept of Chinese people loving and using national products has deepened, and most people are happy to use domestically produced light bulbs. Therefore, they have been able to compete with foreign goods. Within a few years, it is hoped that foreign goods will be completely eliminated. Recently, we interviewed Mr. Hu Xiyuan, the general manager of the leading Yabu Er Electrical Factory in this industry, to learn about the general situation of the industry. The electric light bulb originally came from abroad and was sold at a very high price. Later, the Chinese Yabu Er Electrical Factory took over the business from foreigners and specialized in manufacturing domestically produced electric light bulbs. After their products came out, foreign goods were greatly impacted. In order to avoid Chinese tariffs and reduce transportation costs, foreign merchants then set up factories in our country to manufacture. At the same time, Chinese people, seeing that there was profit to be made, also set up light bulb factories one after another. However, due to a lack of both financial resources and talent, countless factories were established but closed down shortly after. It is very difficult to run an electric light bulb factory. First, there must be technicians with rich experience in chemistry and machinery. Second, there must be skilled workers with long-term training. Third, there must be sufficient capital. If any of these three is lacking, even with millions in capital, it is likely to fail easily. This type of light bulb uses glass as its main material. The manufacturing process requires forty-two connection operations. If the technology is not sophisticated and the workers lack experience, not only will the products not be marketable, but the daily losses, both obvious and hidden, will account for more than twice the total expenses. For example, in the 10th year of the Republic, the Guang Ya factory, run by a certain Cantonese person, spent all of its 300,000 yuan in capital in fifteen months and completely went bankrupt. In addition, there were countless factories that were poorly managed and suffered losses and shutdowns. The Yabu Er factory, which has a longer history and better results, is a clear example. With a small amount of capital, it produces a large quantity. In the past ten years, it has experienced countless hardships and suffered countless setbacks. Currently, its capital has reached 500,000 yuan. The dedication of the authorities is by no means a matter of luck. Recently, due to the decline in the market and the fierce competition in the industry, the situation has become more intense. However, the factory's foundation is solid, all the workers have been trained for a long time, and the technology has become very skilled. Recently, it has spared no effort in recruiting electrical talent. If it can add the latest machinery and expand testing equipment, it will be able to make greater progress. The industry initially had no association. Last year, due to the impact of foreign goods dumping, an association was organized. Its name is the "Shanghai Electrical Manufacturing Industry Association," which includes other electrical manufacturing factories. According to a survey in the 22nd year of the Republic, there were a total of sixteen national product factories in this city specializing in the manufacture of electric light bulbs. Two have now closed, leaving only fourteen. This year, of the fourteen, five have suspended operations, leaving only nine operating normally. The production capacity of these nine factories is 14,875,000 light bulbs per year, of which the output of the Yabu Er factory is 6,875,000 light bulbs. The other factories together produce 8,000,000 light bulbs. Last year's sales of electric light bulbs were approximately 27,000,000 light bulbs, of which foreign goods accounted for one-quarter, counterfeit goods accounted for slightly less than two-quarters, and national products accounted for slightly more than one-quarter, with actual sales totaling 9,500,000 light bulbs. The Yabu Er factory alone accounted for half of this number. The above quantities are not entirely sold in Shanghai alone. However, most of the electric light bulbs in various provinces and cities are purchased from Shanghai. After the September 18th Incident, the sales of domestic light bulbs in North China decreased sharply. The ones that replaced them were naturally mostly foreign goods. This depends on the Chinese people's ability to distinguish and not be deceived. Among the industry, it is especially important to be united and consistent, fully improve technically, and cooperate hand in hand. Do not manufacture crudely and recklessly, and do not fight each other, so as not to lead to failure (Tianran).</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Office of the China Southeast Main Branch of the World Red Swastika Society reported yesterday the details of the relief work recently carried out in Fuzhou. A record of them is as follows: During the recent bloody battle between the National Army and the Red Army in the Dabailing area for several days, there were many Red Army corpses left behind. According to residents' reports, the stench could be smelled for several miles. This office, together with the Fuzhou Red Swastika Branch, organized a burial team. On the 18th, they set off for Lingtou Township to bury a corpse whose name was unknown. They buried one corpse on the mountain. In the Banqiao Hudangmen area, they buried 20 corpses. On the 19th, they went to Qilun Dayang Erjiaoyuan Temple Mountain and buried 21 exposed corpses. They also buried 31 people who were bombed to death by planes at the border between Migao and Ban Township, and 9 exposed corpses. On the 20th, they went to Wanli Niulongxi Laoding and other places and buried 30 exposed corpses, totaling 111 corpses buried. There are now over a thousand refugees gathered near the provincial capital. There has been an outbreak of disease and a lack of medicine. This office has set up a refugee clinic 30 miles outside the city to diagnose and treat refugees. Every day, fifty to sixty people come for diagnosis. As for the Yongtai flood, it has been found that villages along the Dazhangjiang River, about 200 miles, are located downstream of Dehua County. Due to mountain floods, the water rushed down, about two or three zhang high, causing entire villages to be submerged. This is truly a rare disaster in ancient times. Personnel have been dispatched to investigate the disaster victims and will be able to investigate and release funds soon.</p>

<p>Nanyang Office Affairs</p>
<p>The China National Road Construction Association has been established for fourteen years. The facilities of the association have progressed day by day. The president, vice president, and director-general, as well as the directors and deputy directors of the service department, all perform their duties purely on a voluntary basis and do not receive salaries. All income and expenditure are also reviewed in detail by the accounting directors before they can be reimbursed. Each year, the necessary expenses are raised by the president and directors through donations. The economic situation is tight, but it can still show a spirit of struggle. Its affairs are purely to promote road construction and do not involve building roads themselves. This year, a service department was established to provide relief services for highways and to introduce road vehicles, materials registration, and specialized talents. Those who do not understand the facts may have misunderstandings. Recently, because of the disagreement between Lin Shizong, the representative of the Nanyang offices of the association, and Lin Bonian, the local soliciting committee member, the executive board of directors decided to suspend the activities of the Nanyang offices and reorganize them after correcting the branch bylaws. It has also sent a letter to the Consulate in Singapore for filing.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Religious and Philosophical Research Society was founded by famous figures in Shanghai, including Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Xiao Changming, and Li Yujie. The society's main purpose is to study religious truth, promote morality, save people's hearts, and also engage in charitable activities. It is based on the ancient sages' aim of establishing and teaching people, and takes loyalty, forgiveness, integrity, clarity, virtue, righteousness, faith, patience, fairness, generosity, filial piety, benevolence, kindness, awareness, frugality, thrift, truth, propriety, harmony, and twenty characters as the creed of life cultivation, with a view to practicing them personally and carrying them forward. It has been established for a year and the number of members has gradually increased. They are all pure in body and mind and are able to abide by the twenty-character creed, so the society's affairs are becoming more and more developed. For example, the attached mental therapy clinic sees more than 100 patients every day. The founder, Mr. Xiao Changming, has high morals and deep knowledge. In view of the recent decline in morality and the rampant spread of human desires, it is not enough to reverse the crisis without promoting righteousness. Therefore, he gave a lecture on scriptures at the clubhouse at 9:00 PM yesterday. He will continue to give lectures on the scriptures on Sunday (September 2nd) afternoon, so that the audience can understand the true meaning of the five religions, turn hostility into harmony, and hopefully reach the heavenly harmony and stop disasters.</p>

<p>The case of Fu Xiaoan, chairman of the China Tongshang Bank, accusing lawyer Yan Dajue of fabricating facts and intimidation, has been tried once by the First Special District Court. Subsequently, Yan's lawyers repeatedly requested reconciliation from Fu's lawyers, Zhang Xingyan and Dai Chengxiang. They filed for an extension with the court on one hand and negotiated reconciliation terms on the other. However, for two weeks, the opinions of both sides on the issue of publishing an apology in the newspaper have been very different, ultimately leading to the failure of reconciliation. The First Special Court has scheduled to continue the hearing in the Ninth Court by Judge Liu Yugui at 2:00 PM this afternoon.

<p>Witness Also Implicated, Handed Over to Police for Investigation</p>
<p>Xu Shifang, from Qingjiang, manager and accountant of Hongjitang Pharmacy at 1059 Dongxi Huade Road, resigned in June of this year and founded Houde Tang Pharmacy at 932 on the same road. Later, shareholder Wu Genrong, a local, discovered that during Xu's tenure at the store, from September of the 20th year of the Republic to June of this year, he had embezzled 600 yuan of deposits from his wife's younger sister, Gao Linshi. He reported this to the Huishan Police Station, which sent investigator Li Hongsheng to arrest Xu and bring him to the First Special District Court. Xu denied the charges. He was ordered to post 1,000 yuan bail pending trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan visited the Third Criminal Court for a continued hearing. Li Zhishan, the attorney for the Municipal Council, stated that during the adjournment, the wife of shareholder Xu Yongxiang filed a report with the police station, claiming that she also had 1,400 yuan of deposits in December of the 20th year of the Republic, which were handed over to the defendant and his friend, Liang Zixiang, from Ningbo, but no deposit book was given. However, in the following year and at the end of the 22nd year, the defendant paid her annual interest of 1%, or 140 yuan for every 100 yuan, and attached two red receipts. There is no record of this deposit in Hongjitang's accounts. The police station is investigating this case, so no additional charges have been filed yet. The two interest red receipts were presented for inspection. Subsequently, shareholder Xu Yongxiang reported that the 600 yuan deposit of Gao Linshi was entirely handled by the defendant, and the deposit book seal was also stamped by him, and had nothing to do with him. Furthermore, witness Liang Zixiang testified that he worked at Wanhe Pharmacy on Xian Gua Street outside the South City and was a friend of the defendant. At the time when he left Hongjitang, there was a contract stating that the two shareholders were willing to pay a reward of 1,600 yuan, and that he was no longer responsible for any accounts after that. Witness Jie Minghan's statement was the same. The defendant was questioned, but he firmly denied the charges. Regarding Xu Yongxiang's wife's 1,400 yuan, he said it was a loan. He remained evasive about the rest. Municipal Council attorney Li Zhishan stated that witness Liang Zixiang had a significant relationship with the 1,400 yuan deposit book, and requested the court to allow the police station to take him away for investigation. Judge Wu approved the request and adjourned the case for further review.</p>

<p>Order Issued by Jiangsu Finance Department to Comply</p>
<p>The first installment of land price tax for the 22nd year in Shanghai County was opened for collection at the counters on the first of this month. Subsequently, the county government, seeing that Article 2 of the Jiangsu Province Regulations on Late Payment Penalties for Land Tax stipulated that the tax collection period was limited to two months, but the county had already opened for collection in advance according to the old three-month deadline, immediately made corrections and reported to the Jiangsu Finance Department for instructions. The department responded with a telegram from Director Zhao stating: "After investigation, the new regulations on late payment penalties, limiting the period to two months, only apply to Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Yixing, Liyang, Jiading, Kunshan, and Baoshan counties. The remaining counties should continue to follow the old regulations. Please be informed." After receiving the telegram, County Magistrate Pan, in addition to informing the tax collection office, issued a notice to the public yesterday, asking all businesses to be informed that the collection period for the first installment of land price tax for the 23rd year in this county will continue to follow the old regulations, with a limit of three months. Late payment penalties will be levied after the deadline.</p>

<p>Li Xiamao, a foreman at the Rongji Road Coal Yard at No. 1, Daqing Lane, Lao Baidu, Pudong, was suddenly invaded by four armed bandits around 9:00 PM on June 9th of this year. The robbery failed, and the accountant hired by the Li family, Du Shenghong, was shot and injured in the buttocks. Fortunately, the injury was not fatal. Afterwards, the Li family received three threatening letters sent by the bandits by mail, demanding 3,000 yuan and claiming that the attempted robbery the previous night was also done by them. The wording was extremely fierce. The victim reported the matter to the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which dispatched detectives to guard the area of North Sichuan Road designated by the bandits. They arrested bandit Li Changgen and brought him to the Procuratorate of the court for interrogation, filed a public prosecution after clarification, and waited for sentencing after the end of the debate. These details have been repeatedly reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that Judge Shao Qinzhi specially opened the Third Court yesterday morning to pronounce the sentence. Li Changgen was brought to the case and briefly questioned. He was sentenced to twelve years in prison to serve as a warning. Li refused to accept the sentence and immediately declared an appeal in court. The judge approved the appeal and ordered him to present the reasons for the appeal and appeal in accordance with the law. After the pronouncement, the court officers were ordered to take the Li offender back for detention pending instructions.</p>

<p>The police authorities of the French Concession in this city have found that since the arrival of autumn, the weather has been hot. Every evening, people seeking coolness in vegetable markets or on the sidewalks of various roads carry bedding and sleep everywhere, obstructing traffic and greatly hindering sanitation. Several days ago, the authorities issued an order to the chiefs of the police stations to dispatch detectives to drive them away in sections every late night. However, these people waited until the detectives left and then lay down on the spot again. Therefore, last night, a large number of detectives were dispatched to drive several trucks and arrest them in different directions. Those who were caught were sent to the respective police stations in the trucks to be temporarily detained until dawn, when they were released home. They were informed that they would not be allowed to sleep in the vegetable markets or on the sidewalks in the future, in order to maintain hygiene and avoid the spread of disease.</p>

<p>Scoundrels Wang Meiyu, Wang Wenxing, Guan Zhenxiang, and three others, have recently been borrowing the name of Taoist rituals to solicit donations of foreign silver everywhere, obtaining funds for sharing and spending. Unexpectedly, Wang and the other three went to the home of Shen Lantang, a local resident at No. 69, Leishangda Road, French Concession, the afternoon before yesterday, falsely claiming that the Yaofa Temple on Beihai Road was constructing a Dizang Sheng Hui Taiping Public Ritual and requested donations. Shen believed them to be true and gave them four small foreign coins. After Wang and the others obtained the funds and went outside, they were investigated by a Western police officer and a Chinese police officer from No. 132 who were patrolling. Because Wang and the others looked suspicious, they stepped forward to inquire about the situation and copied a donation book, which they took to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police attorney Chen Ming explained the situation and said that it had been found that the defendants had defrauded a certain family in the British Concession several times. Now the police station is prosecuting the defendants under Article 363 of the Criminal Law and requested a trial. When questioned, the defendants confessed that they were indeed poor and helpless, and they had designed to collect money in order to make a living and begged for leniency. Judge Qiu sentenced Wang Meiyu, Wang Wenxing, and Guan Zhenxiang to a fine of ten yuan each for using fraudulent means to induce others to hand over their property and suspended their sentences for two years.</p>

<p>Symptoms Like a Rabid Dog When Poison Took Effect</p>
<p>Fei Ganlang, a 62-year-old Chongming native, ran the Shuanglong Tea Garden in West Street, Gaoqiao Town. The day before yesterday, he went out for something and was bitten on the toe by a dog that suddenly came from the side of the road. Fei did not pay much attention to the slight skin injury. Unexpectedly, the poison took effect yesterday (28th). He was restless and unable to sit or lie down, unable to eat or drink, and his condition was quite fierce. When his family brought tea and rice for him to eat, he would jump up and try to grab and bite them, resembling a rabid dog. Although various methods were used to treat him, the poison had taken effect too deeply. He died of the illness in the afternoon. Many people came to watch and were all shocked by the sight. Some said that it was a tragic way for an old man to die.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government has received instructions from the Taihu Lake Basin Water Conservancy Committee, stating that this year, various counties in the Taihu Lake Basin have experienced a lack of rain during the monsoon season, resulting in severe drought and low water levels. Farmland is unable to be cultivated due to a lack of water for irrigation, and even those seedlings that have been planted are mostly withered, making the autumn harvest hopeless and causing severe losses. The association has specially printed forms for detailed investigation of the different disaster situations in various places to compile statistics and seek remedies. The County Government is instructed to fill out and submit the investigation forms in detail to the association for statistical purposes. County Magistrate Pan has instructed the district chiefs to fill out and report the forms accurately and forward them.</p>

<p>Local Gentry Step in to Mediate</p>
<p>A Disturbance is Finally Settled</p>
<p>This year, due to severe drought and scarce rainfall, farmers everywhere are extremely anxious. The Lingjia Muqiao West Ni Jiaxiang River channel in Gaoqiao Town, Songnan, has not been dredged for many years, and the river mud is silted up, preventing seawater from flowing smoothly. The municipal authorities, out of concern for the people's livelihood, have started to build a dam in Ni Jiaxiang and ordered the Dredging Bureau to use a large water pump to pump water for farmers to irrigate their farmland as much as possible. Unexpectedly, as the dam was nearing completion, it was opposed by the general villagers, who believed that the construction of this dam would be greatly detrimental to the farmers in the future. They mistakenly blamed Lu Guixiang for initiating it, leading to groups of people going to the Lu family to question him. Their actions were rude and clumsy. Mr. Lu repeatedly advised and explained the good intentions of the authorities in considering the people's situation, asking them not to misunderstand. However, the ignorant people did not believe him deeply. Lu had no choice but to lead the villagers to Ling Yunzhai's place in order to escape. However, the villagers continued to make noise and cause trouble even after arriving at the Ling family. Mr. Ling felt that he had been unjustly slandered and that Lu Guixiang had caused this. He decided to file a lawsuit against Lu Guixiang to clear his name. Subsequently, Mr. Zhong Youliang and other local gentry from Gaoqiao stepped in to mediate. Lu apologized to Ling in writing and guaranteed that similar incidents would not happen again in the future. Therefore, the disturbance over the building of the dam was finally settled.</p>

The platform of the board was more than ten feet high. Fang Weicheng was the first to slide down, but the others did not wait for Fang Weicheng to reach the ground and immediately followed. As a result, the momentum was so strong that Fang Weicheng was knocked down from the middle and his head hit the ground violently. At the same time, the children behind him were unable to avoid and fell down one after another, all pressing on Fang Weicheng's head, chest, and other parts of his body, causing Fang Weicheng to be seriously injured and cry out in pain. After the school principal and others learned of the incident, they quickly sent Fang Weicheng to Baolong Hospital.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Inland Waterways Shipping Nearing Complete Shutdown <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Inland Navigation Bureau Requests Relief from Zhejiang Construction Department</p>
<p>The Shanghai inland waterways steamships have been greatly impacted this year.  Those that have suspended operations due to the drought already account for 98% of the total, but there are still several steamships struggling to operate on the Huzhou-Hangzhou lines.  However, with the continuous receding of the river water in recent days, they will also have to suspend operations.  All steamship companies have suffered significant losses, with the Inland Navigation Bureau suffering the most severe damage.  It has already submitted a request for relief to the Zhejiang Construction Department, and the current situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e187">Routes Already Suspended <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Since the drought and shallow water levels, the Shanghai inland waterways steamships that have been unable to operate and have suspended service include the Shenxia Line, Gandang Line, Suhang Line, Changli Line, Xili Line, and others. The number of short-distance steamships that have suspended service is even more numerous to mention. Many of the steamships that have suspended service are stranded halfway and have been unable to return to Shanghai. The bottoms of the ships are now high and dry on the riverbanks, and the iron plates have grown moss. The barges and towing companies have also suffered the same fate, and the hulls of the ships have gradually been damaged. In places like Yixing River, the bottom mud has become as hard as cement. This is truly a catastrophe for the inland waterways steamships.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Shanghai to Hangzhou Line <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Of all the inland waterways steamships, only the Shanghai-Huzhou and Hangzhou lines are still struggling to operate. On the Huzhou line, the water has also receded greatly in the past few days, and the steamships cannot reach directly. The entire line is divided into three sections and is pulled by manpower. The Shanghai-Hangzhou line has been even more difficult to navigate in the past ten days. It is still possible to operate from Shanghai to the vicinity of Zhenze, but afterwards, it is necessary to change to shallow-water steamships. Even then, it is difficult for shallow-water steamships to pass through, and it is necessary to use manpower to pull large ropes for rescue.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a person from the inland waterways steamship company said that if it does not rain, the river water in the interior of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will be completely dry within two months, and the small steamships on the Hangzhou-Huzhou-Xili lines, which can be relied upon to pass through boats, will not be able to be pulled and towed after another month. The complete shutdown of inland waterway transportation in the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang is imminent. This is an unprecedented situation in the past sixty years.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Request for Relief <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The Inland Navigation Bureau is the largest operator of inland waterways steamships in Shanghai, with a total of eleven routes and more than sixty steamships and company ships. Now, due to droughts in various places, the services have been suspended one after another. Only the Huzhou-Hangzhou lines are struggling to operate. The crew members of the suspended ships are still being paid as usual. It is now estimated that the loss in revenue is more than 30,000 yuan, plus the expenses, and there is no end in sight. The bureau is leased to the Zhejiang Construction Department. Within four years, it has suffered four losses due to floods, military disasters, wars, and droughts. It has now appealed to the provincial government for relief, citing the example of Zhejiang Province's relief for drought disasters, due to the bureau's steamships suffering a major drought and completely suspending operations. The submission has been made and is awaiting approval.</p>
<p>However, due to severe brain injuries, he eventually died despite medical treatment. He died at 11:20 AM. The hospital reported the incident to the police, who transferred the body to the coroner's office for examination and notified the family.

<h3 id="e191">Magic Trick Swindle of a Huge Sum <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>A Loud Bang, Flames Erupted</p>
<p>Five Thousand Dollars Turned to Ashes</p>
<p>Shen Baochang, the younger brother of Shen Baohe, a local resident living at No. 130 Jiuxiao Chang in the city, is currently working as a salesman in the printing industry. Recently, a friend introduced him to Pei Zhongying, an executive of a certain large company, who wanted to order a large quantity of printed materials. Baochang thought he had received a huge business deal, so he tried his best to please him and became very close to him. At first, they discussed samples and prices, and Pei Zhongying deliberately pretended to be an amateur and allowed him to open an account. Unexpectedly, a week ago, Pei Zhongying suddenly discussed something with Shen Baochang. He said that he had a Western magician who could transform banknotes in the same way. For example, a 1,000 yuan banknote could be turned into 2,000 yuan in ten minutes. He had asked the Westerner to transform 5,000 yuan for him as a capital for doing business, but he could not borrow this huge sum of money at the moment. He wanted to ask for help to raise 5,000 yuan, which would only take ten minutes, and he would return it and pay interest of 200 yuan. He also said that for the sake of mutual trust, Shen Baochang should monitor the scene to avoid any negligence. Baochang himself did not have this huge sum of money, but because they were on good terms and it was not convenient to refuse, he turned to his brother Shen Baohe for help and borrowed the money in various ways, raising 5,000 yuan. He then accompanied Pei Zhongying to the Western magician's place at a certain number on Huanlong Road in the French Concession and placed the silver banknotes on the table. Baochang watched closely and saw the Westerner perform magic. Unexpectedly, in less than five minutes, there was a loud bang, and the 5,000 yuan banknotes on the table were burned to ashes. Baochang immediately asked Pei Zhongying to return the 5,000 yuan banknotes. Pei said that the disaster was caused by improper performance, and that now that things had come to this, he could only write a temporary IOU and try to raise the money to repay him. Baochang had no choice but to take the IOU back to his brother. Baohe said that he had been cheated by a magic trick and that he should quickly negotiate with the Pei surname. However, he did not know the Pei surname's residence. Unexpectedly, one afternoon a few days ago, Shen Baochang passed by Laobeimen and encountered Pei Zhongying and his mistress Chen Wangshi. He immediately called the police and they were detained at the first precinct of the second district for investigation. After Shen, the precinct chief, learned that the case involved a magic trick swindle of a huge sum of money, he ordered them to be sent to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>Six Restaurants Each Fined Ten Yuan</p>
<p>A Certain Person Shouted, "Lord, Have Mercy!"</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News, police officers from the Consulate General mobilized together late on the 27th and inspected Japanese restaurants and coffee shops in this city. They arrested a number of waitresses on the spot for secretly engaging in prostitution. On the 28th, six restaurant owners were punished. One was at No. 5 Shuntianfang, Haining Road, the second was at No. 79 Peng Road, the third was at No. 135 Nanxun Road, the fourth was at No. 365 Peng Road, the fifth was at No. 641 North Sichuan Road, and the sixth was at No. 34 Haining Road. The above six restaurants (i.e., restaurants) all violated the business control regulations and were each fined ten yuan. In addition, when the police broke in to inspect Saito Ryuichi's Mingyuanzhai at No. 3, Gong'anli, Wusong Road, the waitress Kido Keiko happened to be sleeping with a guest and was detained for five days. Also, when the police went upstairs at a certain restaurant that day, an employee of a certain company, accompanied by two waitresses, heard the sound and fled to the sundeck, hiding in the corner of the roof. They were then seen by the police and shouted, "Lord, have mercy!" This was also an interesting scene during the inspection.</p>

<p>Woman Had Another Love and Abandoned Him</p>
<p>The Concubine's Lover Was Angry and Ruthlessly Laid His Hands On Her</p>
<p>Wu Guizhen, also known as Yang 囡, a woman from Suzhou, was 22 years old and had a certain degree of beauty and a very romantic nature. She had an affair with Wang A'si from Chongming. At first, they loved each other dearly and lived together like a married couple. Recently, Wang became idle and his economic situation was inevitably tight. The woman was not used to poverty and suddenly became disgusted with Wang. On the 20th of this month, she moved alone to No. 56 Ningguoli, Ningguo Road, and had an ambiguous relationship with a certain Jia. Wang found out about this. On the morning of the day before yesterday, he visited several times, but the woman did not meet him. At about 1:00 PM, Wang was extremely angry and held a sharp ax, intending to kill the woman. Unexpectedly, he met her on his way in Xinjiawan Lane, Heilong Road. They met on a narrow road, and he immediately slashed the woman's head more than a dozen times with the ax, causing her brains to burst out and blood and flesh to fly everywhere. She immediately fell to the ground. Seeing that he had achieved his goal, Wang abandoned the ax and fled without a trace. Afterwards, Hua Bu No. 1891 of the Yangshupu Police Station saw it and quickly reported it to the police station by telephone. An ambulance was sent to the scene to take her to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, and investigator Hou Fulin was sent to investigate. A letter was found next to her body, written by someone named Genbao, which said that he must not break his promise about what he had said before and that he would come to meet her at 1:00 PM on Sunday. It was then known that the woman lived there, and Liu Ziyu, the second landlord of the house, was summoned to the police station to inquire about the incident. The woman, however, suffered too much damage and could not be saved. She died at about 6:00 PM that day. The investigators took the body to the Filen Road coroner's office. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the Special First Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others, arrived at the office to examine the body. First, the Western police chief reported the investigation process, and said that the deceased and Wang A'si had fought three times before. Also, according to Liu Ziyu, the deceased, a native of Funing, rented the back building of his house on the 20th of this month. Wang A'si came to visit at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, but the deceased had gone out to buy vegetables. He came again twice, but did not meet her. Later, he did not know how he killed her. After Guo learned of the situation, he ordered that the deceased, Wu Guizhen, female, was indeed killed by being slashed in the head with an ax before her death. The suspect, Wang A'si, should be strictly arrested by the police station and brought to justice. The body was handed over to Pushan Villa for collection.</p>
<p>The company had to find a way to drag the steamship across this shallow river, then release it for a while, and then have the boatmen push and pull it before it could pass through the dried-up channel. The Shanghai-Hangzhou water line was divided into six sections, and the difficulty of traveling on it was as severe as before. Once, a small steamship from Shanghai to Hangzhou took more than a week to reach its destination.</p>

The individuals include Huangyan Xiaobao and Zheng Ahong in District One, Shao Changsheng (aka Six-Finger Changsheng) in District One, Wugui Jinbao and Laipi Fuqing in District One, and Jin Heshang in District Three (note: all of the above individuals are wanted). Chief Wen was furious upon hearing this and ordered the case to be solved within a time limit.

<p>Letter from the Shanghai North Eight Roads Business Association</p>
<p>To: Chinese Merchants' Public Bus Company</p>
<p>The Shanghai North Eight Roads Business Association sent a letter yesterday to the Zhabei Chinese Merchants' Public Bus Company, requesting that the company divert the No. 3 special express bus back to Zhongxing Road in order to maintain the city's economy and facilitate travel. The original letter is transcribed below: "To whom it may concern: The development of local enterprises and the progress of culture must rely on transportation as a hub. There is more than one way to transport, but it depends on the needs of the locality. In Shanghai, in terms of the current situation, the Zhejiang Road intersection in the south is the center of Shanghai's transportation. Therefore, the business of the three companies (Sincere, Wing On, Sun Sun) is booming. Places such as Caojiadu and Xujiahui in western Shanghai are far away from the three companies, but they are relying on convenient transportation to flourish. Our Zhabei area has almost no transportation. Although it is close to the three companies, transportation and culture are still blocked, which is a great sigh. The Datong Road and Zhongxing Road area in the north connects to the concession in the south, Liuhang in the north, Wusong in the east, and Zhenru in the west. In recent years, there have been many commercial factories, vegetable markets, hotels, restaurants, and theaters. Municipal facilities are becoming more and more complete, but transportation is inconvenient, and travelers regard it as a danger, which affects the city's economy. In June of this year, your company diverted the special express bus from Qiujiang Road via Zhongxing Road to Dayang Bridge. After only a month, the owners along the road were very active. Some planned to build houses, and some bought land. Transportation is very important to the city's economy. Unexpectedly, your company suddenly changed the route to Jiaotong Road, which greatly disappointed the merchants and people. For the sake of local business development, we hereby send this letter, hoping that your company will forward it to the Municipal Government and the Public Works Bureau, and divert the special express bus back to Zhongxing Road in order to facilitate transportation and promote the city's economy. We will be very grateful."</p>

<h3 id="e206">Notification from the Ministry of Industry to the Chamber of Commerce Regarding the Promotion of Domestic Timber <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Drafted by the public works departments of various provinces and cities.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, citing the massive import of foreign pine in recent years and the declining sales of domestic pine, had resolved at its fifth delegate assembly to petition the National Government's Executive Yuan, Ministry of Industry, etc., to find ways to provide relief in order to maintain domestic timber, etc. It is now learned that the Ministry of Industry yesterday notified the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that the application of domestic construction timber has been repeatedly ordered by the government and has been duly recorded. Regarding the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's original request to establish regulations, stipulating that in the future, all construction must adhere to the use of a certain proportion of domestic fir timber before licenses are issued, this matter falls under the jurisdiction of the public works departments of various provinces and cities. The provincial and municipal governments should be instructed to consider local conditions and draft implementation measures to be submitted to the ministry for record-keeping and compliance, aiming for standardization. However, it has been found that domestic timber has not yet been tested for its modulus of elasticity, elastic strength, breaking strength, etc., making it impossible to understand its properties. Furthermore, there is no standard for dimensions, causing great inconvenience in its use. Improvements are urgently needed. The Ministry's Central Industrial Testing Laboratory has equipment for timber testing. Industry guilds from various timber producing areas should submit samples to the laboratory for testing and guidance on standard timber extraction methods to meet the needs of modern construction. A copy of the letter and the original request are being forwarded to various provincial and municipal governments for handling, and instructions are being issued to the Central Industrial Testing Laboratory for compliance. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is being notified accordingly.</p>

<p>The houses in Leyi Lane, Nanyang Bridge, Avenue Anna King, French Concession, totaling thirty to forty buildings, were built only fourteen or fifteen years ago. The buildings are sturdy and there is no need for reconstruction. In June of this year, the landlord, Jiang Hanzhai, suddenly cited reconstruction as a reason. Upon hearing the news, the tenants elected representatives to negotiate with the landlord. As a result, the landlord agreed to a postponement, and the Tillback Real Estate Department announced a one-year extension, but with a 30% rent increase and payment of all outstanding rent. Otherwise, reconstruction would proceed as planned. While the tenants were preparing to negotiate with the landlord regarding the rent increase and extension period, they suddenly received a notice from the Tillback Real Estate Department canceling the previous agreement and deciding to proceed with reconstruction, requiring all tenants to vacate the premises before September 30th. The tenants unanimously opposed this move by the landlord and sent a letter to the Fourth Branch of the Second Special District Municipal Federation requesting them to send representatives to mediate with the landlord for a final time on the previous day. It is now reported that the mediation by the Federation has yielded no results, with the landlord's attitude remaining firm and leaving no room for negotiation. The tenants then held a general meeting of all tenants at the Citizen's Hall inside the Anxin Temple at 8 PM yesterday to discuss resolute countermeasures. More than forty tenants attended, and Dong Wenli and Ye Ruizhai, standing committee members of the Fourth District Municipal Federation, attended to report on the mediation with the landlord and provide guidance. Li Yuting chaired the meeting, and Yu Jingqing served as the recorder. After the report, the following countermeasures were resolved: (1) All stood up and unanimously expressed their determination to refuse to vacate the premises under any pressure; (2) Engage Wu Kaisheng and Zhu Dianqing, two prominent lawyers, as legal advisors to provide legal protection; (3) Immediately establish the Leyi Lane branch of the Fourth Branch of the Citizen's Association, with Li Yuting, Wang Dekui, and Tang Baoshan as officers responsible for negotiations and reporting to higher authorities for record-keeping; (4) Collect different notices posted by the landlord at the entrance of the lane and those issued by the rental department, as well as all other evidence, and submit them to the party and government authorities to seek justice and prevent the demolition of the houses in order to maintain social order; (5) Send letters to various organizations to appeal for united assistance; (6) Issue a declaration detailing the history of oppression and requesting all sectors to rise up and provide assistance; (7) Print and distribute slogans to show determination; (8) Implement the signing of covenants to prevent breaches and urge all households to deposit their outstanding rent; (9) Stipulate that each building should contribute ten yuan for all negotiation expenses.

<h3 id="e218">How to Strive in Reading and Answering Questions <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>|| Answer to Mr. Zhang Yiyan</p>
<p>Not long ago, this column published an article discussing "Private Life and Ideals." That piece was triggered by two other articles, one being "On the Contradictions of Life" and the other "Explaining Practice." Mr. Zhang’s letter stated that after reading "Private Life and Ideals" and examining his own private life, he had many doubts. Mr. Zhang believes this is "a common ailment suffered by many people," which he "cannot overcome, like the surging waves of youthful melancholy." We have also seen this for a long time.</p>
<p>It seems Mr. Zhang has not truly grasped the important points of "Private Life and Ideals." That article was a continuation of the two articles mentioned earlier. Our emphasis was only on the point that private life should be consistent with ideals. Because we often see people with high ideals but deplorable private lives, they only have ideals but ultimately cannot realize them. Therefore, we specifically raised this point to answer Mr. Xiao and Mr. Luo. As for how to achieve this, we can only offer principles and methods, not detailed specifics of the process. Because that is impossible. Everyone has their own life practices and ideals. How can you plan for others? Mr. Zhang thinks the word "striving" is "too difficult for people to understand" and "suspects that the word 'striving' is just a comforting word, like stuffing a piece of candy in the mouth of a crying child." This is a complete misunderstanding of the scientific method of managing one's life. Regarding the "Private Life and Ideals" article, we deliberately omitted this part because we had already said a little in the "On the Contradictions of Life" and "Explaining Practice" articles. Mr. Zhang may not have read those two short essays!</p>
<p>Below, we will further discuss with Mr. Zhang the three questions he raised. The first is about sex, the second is about the way out of life, and the third is about stimulation. Mr. Zhang considers these three questions "the biggest cause of youth's depression, hindering their progress, and destroying their will." To be honest, we cannot completely agree.</p>
<p>We believe that a youth with a correct worldview, social view, and outlook on life, who already has correct ideals, his private life will gradually approach his ideals day by day and will never deviate too far. As long as he understands the contradictory nature of life itself, he will not see life as a fixed, static state. He will not fear the contradictions of life, succumb to the contradictions that contradict his ideals, nor will he deliberately hide the contradictions in his life, fearing that others will see them. A person who does not shy away from practice has the perseverance to face all hardships. He is very serious about the struggle in his private life and is unwilling to relax even a little. Like the three questions raised by Mr. Zhang, the first one does occupy a more important position in the private life of young people. However, it is not as extreme as Mr. Zhang said. Generally, sexual depression leading to "being foolish" and "bored" all day long is only a few, all of the molecules in the social level are not the general public. But this does not deny the sexual needs of young people. The sexual desires of young people are very normal. We believe that a person who practices can naturally solve it according to their living conditions. All problems can only be solved in practice. But don't exaggerate this problem too much. When Mr. Zhang encounters sexual desires, he "sits in boredom for a day." This is because Mr. Zhang's life is still relatively leisurely, so the method of solving it is also leisurely. However, Mr. Zhang has not solved the problem. Sexual climaxes come and go, and then he has to adopt "sitting in boredom for a day." May I ask, is this still a life lived by a human being? If we want to talk about a reluctant solution to this problem, it is the same as the life problem we will talk about below. In this "death," we advocate a compromise solution, that is, when you can marry, don't demand too much in terms of the partner, and simplify the sexual problem. When you can't marry, use work, labor, etc. to reduce its attacks, not "sitting in boredom." Because the problem of sex is ultimately secondary to food. You won't starve to death without a wife. Naturally, this is not a true solution to the problem. This problem is a social problem and cannot be completely solved by an individual alone. A young man with ideals will not be depressed by these problems and destroy his own will because he knows it is completely useless. And if you exaggerate this kind of contradiction in life too much, although you "dare not degenerate," in fact, being in "annoyance" all day long, unable to move forward, is no different from degenerating, is it?

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Ghosts Carry a Cart of Distant Guests from Guanzhong; Destitute Families Cross the Ferry and Mourn the Qin People</p>
<p>Zhang Jiefu said: Actually, we are not that old. As long as we find a better job, we can leave after a year or two. Enduring a bit of hardship doesn't matter much. Li Shilian had nothing to say but sighed. In their extremely aggrieved situation, the car drove to the bottom of the Xi’an city. According to the rules, there was an inspection at the city gate before being allowed to pass. Both Zhang and Li were visiting Xi’an for the first time and immediately began to pay attention after entering the city. The most striking difference from the East is that everything is light yellow. The walls of the houses are all built of yellow earth, absolutely without any paint. The soil on the streets is not as jet-black as in the East but has a grayish-yellow tinge. Even the tiles on the roofs seem somewhat yellow, probably due to the dust blown onto them, covering them with a layer of yellow. The car turned two corners on such a wide street and headed onto a main street. Although this street was also seventy or eighty feet wide, it was entirely a dirt road. Some shops with wooden-floored buildings were also tilting and falling. Most of the shops still looked like the old towns in the East forty or fifty years ago. Some had a square wooden stall propped up at the entrance, some hung strings of paper tassels under the eaves, and some hung square blue cloth signs with red lettering in the middle. As the two of them were admiring the scene, the car stopped. Looking up, they saw a high wall of an earthen warehouse next to the road, with a one-character door frame under it. Above the door was a horizontal plaque with three large characters: Little Western Paradise. Looking inside the door, there was a counter on the left and a large signboard on the wooden wall on the right, which was the place for travelers to register their names. Seeing this situation, it was quite like a small inn in the interior of the Yangtze River. He asked Wang Laowu: Is this the best hotel in Xi’an city? Wang Laowu said: If you want to find a cheaper hotel than this, there are many. You can call a rickshaw to take you there. Zhang Jiefu said: If there are hotels smaller than this, how can we live? Okay, then let's stay at Little Western Paradise. (Eight)</p>
<h3 id="e220">The Examination Candidate and the Old Examination Candidate Sun Yucai <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>My younger cousin came to take the entrance examination at XX Middle School. On the day of the exam, he asked me to send him there.</p>
<p>As the morning sun rose, two rickshaws pulled up to the school gate. Walking in, the playground, corridors, and open spaces were already filled with many examination candidates.</p>
<p>Most of these examination candidates came from the rural areas of the interior, so very few of them were dressed in Western style, and no more than one-third wore leather shoes. But they all had a long gown, made of Hangzhou silk, official gauze, summer cloth, gauze, and silk, but I didn't see any thin silk gauze.</p>
<p>Among these many young examination candidates, there were quite a few old men over forty or fifty years old, wearing blue cloth shoes, white cloth socks, and a short summer cloth jacket and pants, also white. Some wore old straw hats that had turned black, some wore patched summer cloth long gowns, some had a pair of copper-rimmed glasses on their eyes, and some wore foreign socks instead of cloth socks, which were probably newly bought. It is said that these are all the fathers of the examination candidates, the old examination candidates. It was still early, and everyone was pacing, with humorous expressions on their faces. On one side of the grape trellis, I heard an examination candidate and an old examination candidate talking:</p>
<p>"………This time, it was your mother who was willing to exchange some gold jewelry, otherwise you would have to help out in your uncle's shop; if the situation doesn't change, we can't think about the future.………I don't expect anything from you, just want you to be like Chunping in Dongcun, graduate and work in Shanghai, and send me a few dollars every month.……"</p>
<p>Because I had something to do and had to come back, I couldn't listen anymore. On the way back, I thought: "I'm afraid that in a year, these examination candidates will come back wearing Western suits, and even the old examination candidates won't be able to recognize them."</p>

<h3 id="e222">Ming Dynasty Restaurant <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>The sea breeze has swept through Nanjing, but only the south of the city still has some ancient charm. I wanted to taste a bit of "Nanjing flavor," so someone mentioned the Ming Dynasty Restaurant.</p>
<p>The Ming Dynasty Restaurant is located on Yuhua Road outside Zhonghua Gate, named "Ma Xiangxing," and is a complete halal restaurant. Its appearance is similar to that of the "Desolate Restaurant" in Suzhou. Upon entering, there is a stove, inside which people are sitting around tables drinking tea or sorghum liquor. However, those who come for the name generally take eating snacks as the principle. Noodles, dumplings, and pot stickers all use beef as the main ingredient. Its beauty lies in the perfect skill of the fire. The soup is mixed with chicken broth, especially the beef tendon, which is cooked very tenderly. It melts in your mouth and does not require chewing. This is one of the reasons why it has been famous for a long time. According to old diners, there is also a dish called "Stewed Something" (I have forgotten this special term), which is a unique flavor made by cooking the lower part of the cow's jaw until it is crispy and tender. They said they didn't have it that day, so it was a pity I couldn't try it.</p>
<p>Because of the good business, two elegant seats were opened on the left. Sun Zhesheng, the president of the Legislative Yuan, often patronizes the place. This year, Chu Minyi advocated flying kites, and Yuhuatai suddenly became crowded with people. Many people came to taste the "Ming Dynasty flavor," and the Ming Dynasty Restaurant was so crowded that people even took matters into their own hands and rushed to the cutting board to grab five-spice beef to eat.</p>
<p>Another point "that can show that they can maintain the ancient Chinese style is that everything is priced using 'cash codes.'" When we go to Qifang Pavilion to eat a bowl of clear tea, giving a small tip of five or six copper coins will make the waiter dissatisfied. However, the waiters at Ma Xiangxing don't care about these things. If you give a little more tip, they will smile and bow like shrimps to thank us.</p>
<p>Some say that this store was not founded in the Ming Dynasty but was founded by the current owner's great-grandfather, about 100 years ago. However, the poet Chen Shiyi has already been fooled, thinking that it is a real Ming Dynasty restaurant, so why should we be too serious and waste our time on research!</p>

<h3 id="e224">Imperial Fragrance Adrift: A Record <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, although Qing Shan's suggestion was to let the Empress Dowager rest in Tianjin, she could not accept his kindness. On the way, she declared that she wanted to rest. At that time, Qing Shan naturally dared not offer any more loyal advice, and the train stopped immediately. Here, not only was it not the big city that Qing Shan had imagined, nor was it in a small village, it was simply in a vast, uninhabited wilderness. But the Empress Dowager had absolutely not noticed this and only urged the eunuchs and maids to quickly put her quilts and pillows in order, and then she quietly went to sleep.</p>
<p>Our train actually had electric lighting equipment. The Empress Dowager did not have much affection for other new ideas or new devices, but she especially liked electric lights. In the palace and in the Summer Palace, there was a generator installed in each; therefore, she had come to regard electric lighting equipment as a necessary condition in daily life.</p>
<p>The news that the Empress Dowager had rested immediately gave the troops in the train following behind a considerable shock due to the sudden stop of our train; therefore, their train also stopped, about twenty or thirty feet away, stopping without a sound. Hundreds of imperial guards, wearing helmets and armor, and fully armed, quietly climbed out of the train and began to take on their responsibility of guarding. The surroundings of this yellow train were instantly filled with black shadows coming and going, and the flashing of swords. Especially on the left and right sides of the car that Emperor Guangxu was riding in, the guards were particularly strict; it would be more accurate to say that this special preparation was for the purpose of defending him rather than protecting Guangxu. Guangxu's plight was truly worse than that of any commoner, which I cannot help but point out again and again. (117)</p>
<h3 id="e225">A Small Contribution to Indicating Gender <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— (Meixue)</p>
<p>Since each form has a gender column, it is of course very clear who is male and who is female. However, in the recent list of new students announced by various universities, which mostly admit both male and female students, it is not immediately clear to the outside world how many of the admitted new students are male and how many are female. This is a shortcoming in indicating gender.</p>
<p>Some say: "The signatures of women always carry a bit of femininity, so it is not necessary to indicate gender on the list, and people will naturally know." This statement is not correct. Recently, the names of female students have gradually become more masculine. Just by paying attention to the name, it is impossible to tell whether it is male or female. I think that if women call themselves "Ms." under their names, it seems a bit boastful and cannot be written on the exam paper, but it is okay to add a "Shi" character below the surname. With this identification, it will be clear at a glance whether it is male or female. Those with "Shi" are female, and those without "Shi" are male. According to this list on various forms, it is not necessary to add a gender item. When universities release the list according to this list, it will be clear who is male and who is female. The matter is very simple, why not adopt some of my small contributions?</p>
<p>Furthermore, adding "Shi" after a woman's surname is neither contrary to ancient teachings nor has the boastful nature of calling oneself "Ms." "Neither arrogant nor humble," it is also worthy of adoption by the women's world.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e226">Hometown <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Seqiu</p>
<p>When the train arrived at S City, I transferred to a small gasoline boat. With the sound of the leaves flapping, I left the pier and headed towards the future of my hometown.</p>
<p>Between spring and summer, the river water was rising, so soft and green! The boats in the river shuttled back and forth like shuttles, and the green fields on both sides reached directly to the sky. In the distance, I could vaguely see a distant mountain stretching into the clouds. "Oh, what a beautiful nature!" I couldn't help but walk out of the cabin, stand at the bow of the boat, and take a deep breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>I had been in the hustle and bustle of the city all day, my head dizzy from the foul air, and I couldn't get a moment of peace. I hadn't seen this kind of scenery in three years, and I felt an unspeakable joy in my heart. The small gasoline boat was dragging a very large barge behind it, so the speed couldn't be fast. It sailed slowly all the way. Looking down, the water in the river was clear enough to see the bottom. From time to time, countless fish were swimming back and forth in the water, so carefree and content. It has no ambition to invade others, and others do not invade it. It just lives a happy life leisurely.</p>
<p>From the voices of people on both sides of the river, I knew that I was getting closer and closer to my hometown. My heart felt sweet, sour, and bitter, and I didn't even know what it tasted like. Before long, my hometown, which I had dreamed of for so long, appeared before my eyes. The person who came to pick me up was also greeting me on the shore. At this time, the sun was gradually setting, and I only saw a red glow in the distance flying up to the sky, shining on the fields like blood. The guests in the boat walked out of the cabin one by one to go ashore. I also picked up my things and walked ashore, and slowly walked with the person sent by my family to pick me up. After turning a few bends in the fields, I arrived at X Town.</p>
<p>This small town has streets so narrow that they are almost as wide as the narrow alleys in the Shanghai Concession. The road surface is half dirt and half pebbles, and uneven in height. If it rains, it will be so muddy that it is impossible to walk. One side of the street faces the water. Although the river is small, there are many willows planted on both banks, constantly scratching their heads and making gestures in the wind, welcoming and sending off the passing boats. On the other side are shops. There are dozens of shops in a row, displaying various goods and waiting to be sold, including grain stores, foreign goods stores, and miniature department stores... These many shops all face the small river. Except for the morning vegetable market being a little more crowded, the streets are quiet and pedestrians are rare all day long. The staff in the shops sit in the cabinets all day long. They have neither radio to listen to like the stores in Shanghai nor do they have modern ladies to visit. With nothing to do all day long, they can only stare blankly at the boats coming and going in the shade of the trees opposite, and listen to the gentle rowing sounds. In fact, this kind of realm is not easy to obtain, but they are already tired of it, dreaming of the prosperity of Shanghai all day long.</p>
<p>"This is the one who came back from Shanghai." In each of their eyes, they expressed the psychology of envying Shanghai people. Going through an alley, the back is our hometown. At this time, my mother and daughter, as well as other relatives, came out with smiles and asked me why I came so late. My mother said: "The tomb has been built. Thanks to us coming back ten days earlier, we have arranged everything very comfortably. The coffins of your grandparents, which had been placed in the funeral home for a long time, were transported to the tomb yesterday. The burial day is the afternoon of the day after tomorrow. Your wife's coffin has just been transported from Shanghai. Probably the barge was too slow and delayed for so many days. It is temporarily placed in the funeral home. Since you have come down, you have to go see her."</p>
<p>I felt a pang of sadness and couldn't speak. I vaguely followed the person who was guiding me, staggering in the fields where the setting sun was about to end. After a few hundred steps, I could see the funeral home in front of me. At this time, my heart was filled with sadness, and I just lowered my head and followed the person in front of me. Walking to the door of several bungalows, the person guarding the funeral home opened the door and pointed with a smile at the one in the middle... God! Isn't that the shell of my wife sleeping there? At this time, the phantoms of three years ago jumped before my eyes, my eyes dizzy, and my ears were ringing endlessly. Wife! I wonder if you know that I have recently suffered even more of the tastes of the world? I held my heart with both hands, and I couldn't hold back the tears any longer.</p>
<p>In my confusion, I heard people say, "It's getting darker, let's go back!"</p>

<p>— Yang'an</p>
<p>Speaking with Tears</p>
<p>The news published in the newspaper every day is always about foreign goods being dumped and imports increasing sharply. Recently, a large amount of silver has been exported, and the cash reserves are drying up. Everyone says that they have suffered the pain of foreign goods selling well. National goods factories have reached this point. If they are not numb or insane, there will never be a situation of self-slaughter and infighting. But the business is not like this. There are still many factories that have forgotten the situation where the great enemy is in front of them and are surrounded by enemies on all sides, and they are still fighting desperately, not destroying industry rules, cutting prices to compete for sales, or producing shoddy goods and arbitrarily lowering prices. Industry associations have no legal means to sanction them; good-intentioned advice is also ignored. Like mad dogs, like insanity, the extreme is nothing more than harming others and not benefiting oneself, being jealous of others, and the result is perishing together, creating opportunities for foreign merchants. The ancients said that doing things should not cause pain to relatives but should bring joy to enemies. If there is such a situation among colleagues, whether it is for colleagues or compatriots, hearing this news is really very painful. However, the enemies of the neighbors celebrate every day and clap their hands from time to time, fearing that we are not like this. If there is some blood, some conscience, and some vision in any industry, they will never go straight to the end. There are not only the culprits, the scum, and the troublemakers of the industry. Judging from their intentions, they will not stop until the national goods disappear. They are true traitors, true social pests, and treacherous merchants who destroy the country and exterminate the race. Those who do not suffer human disaster will be punished by heaven. However, there is always justice in society, and there is right and wrong in the business world. For the current plan;</p>
<p>(1) Industry associations should be organized and powerful. Any industry that has such a situation should be severely sanctioned. Colleagues should not interact with each other, financial circles should cut off relations, and they should be expelled from the industry and not be in the same country as China.</p>
<p>(2) Industry associations should set prices and product grades. If a situation of price cuts or shoddy goods is discovered, it should be exposed and announced to the whole country immediately.</p>
<p>(3) Industry associations should invite technical experts to guide and organize each factory at any time, so that the products become more refined day by day to suit the tastes of users, and the cost is reduced to resist the invasion of foreign goods.</p>
<p>Recently, Shanghai National Goods organizations have seen this dangerous situation and proposed the establishment of a unified industry control committee to prevent price cuts and maintain the market. This view is very helpful for saving the country with national goods. I think there are many people in all industries who are deeply aware of justice. At this point, the rise and fall depend on one move. Only industry unity and cooperation can be possible, and it must not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>National Goods Proposals</p>
<h3 id="e228">Beggars Should Not Walk Side by Side <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Jingcun</p>
<p>"Beggars should not walk side by side" is a very common saying, and I would like to offer this sentence to those who are determined to start national goods factories.</p>
<p>Today, if we want to start a national goods factory, we must not forget a powerful enemy at the moment, which is the dumping of foreign goods. When resisting foreign aggression, we must pay attention to not creating internal conflicts again. If foreign aggression has not gone away and internal conflicts arise again, then the annihilation of the entire army is an expected thing. This very simple truth is known to everyone, but often many people forget this point due to being blinded by profit and suffer a miserable defeat.</p>
<p>Some say that our people are rich in imitation but lack creativity. This sentence seems to be somewhat true. Seeing that others have started a seasoning factory and made a profit, I also started a seasoning factory, you also started a seasoning factory, and he also started a seasoning factory. Seasonings filled the market, and the result was price competition, and in the future, they would all perish together. The rubber industry, enamel industry, thermos industry, and the emerging Bakelite industry all have this trend. If this dispersed power is concentrated, any strong enemy can be defeated. However, everyone does not think this way, and they act independently, and even compete with each other to reduce external strength. Isn't this digging one's own grave? Some say that there can be progress only if national goods production has more competition. I do not deny this sentence, but the object of competition is best to use foreign goods, and comparing competition with domestic products is not a hero, just like warlords who are brave in internal warfare and afraid of foreign wars, which is equally disgusting.</p>
<p>If I want to start a national goods factory, I must choose a business that the people of the country have not paid attention to. Perhaps my experience, knowledge, capital, and talent are suitable for running a certain national goods factory, and this factory is already being run by someone, I will completely contribute my experience, knowledge, capital, and talent to him, participate in the work, in order to increase his production capacity and strengthen his external strength, remembering "Beggars should not walk side by side," and also be sure to recognize the enemy, and not kill each other.</p>

<h3 id="e229">A Good Sign in the National Products Movement <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Everyone knows that our Republic of China has truly reached a critical period of national crisis! While there are many reasons for this crisis, a major one is that most citizens are unwilling to use domestic products and instead act as promoters of foreign goods, causing domestic wealth to flow out, enriching foreigners while impoverishing our own people. Therefore, to resolve the national crisis and enable China to exist independently and freely in the world, we must make efforts in all aspects. However, promoting national products is undoubtedly one solution to this crisis, and this I can assert.</p>
<p>However, our Chinese national products movement has been promoted for quite a few years now. In theory, it should have achieved considerable success. Alas! The reality is that while proponents shout themselves hoarse, those who actually practice it are as rare as morning stars. From the perspective of those in the national products sector, this situation is deeply disheartening.</p>
<p>Why hasn't the promotion of national products yielded good results or significant achievements? While there are many reasons, I believe that the lack of governmental power to aid in its implementation is also a factor in the movement's failure to achieve results.</p>
<p>Now, things are looking up. On the 23rd of this month, I read in the newspaper that the Social, Education, and Public Safety Bureaus jointly discussed banning outlandish clothing. The regulations included not only strict orders to subordinates to ban outlandish clothing for both men and women but also strict orders that all men and women should, as much as possible, use domestic products when purchasing new clothing. The bureaus have drafted measures for the police to rigorously enforce. Upon reading this news, I couldn't help but applaud, recognizing it as a good sign for the future of our Chinese national products movement, worthy of endless praise.</p>
<p>This news makes me think that our Chinese authorities are now also vigorously promoting and enthusiastically supporting the national products movement. As the saying goes, "When those above cherish something, those below will cherish it even more." It is expected that with the government's vigorous promotion, the national products movement will undoubtedly achieve good results and significant accomplishments.</p>
<p>Finally, I especially hope that those compatriots who enjoy promoting foreign goods will quickly wake up! You must know that promoting national products is becoming a unanimous trend throughout the country. To violate this trend is to become a public enemy of the nation. "Public enemies" need to be compelled to use domestic products with political power. By that time, it will be too late for regrets.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Sichuan Crepe <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Lun</p>
<p>Sichuan crepe, also known as Sichuan silk in Beiping, is one of the most famous silk fabrics in Chengdu. It is light, soft, dense, and very breathable when worn, and comes in a variety of vibrant colors. While its surface may not be as smooth and delicate as Hangzhou silk or spun silk, its material is more durable and its colors more wash-resistant than Hangzhou silk or spun silk.</p>
<p>Sichuan crepe can not only be used to make general summer clothing for both men and women but can also be used for autumn jackets and winter padded coats, making you feel light and warm.</p>
<p>In recent years, female students in large and medium-sized schools in Sichuan have been using crepe to make their everyday skirts because it is both economical and beautiful. It doesn't easily fray or snag even when worn daily. And when it gets dirty, you can take it off, wash it with boiling water, dry it in the sun, and iron it flat, making it look as good as new. As the autumn semester is about to begin, I would like to introduce Sichuan crepe to my fellow female students in secondary schools who are enthusiastically promoting national products.</p>
<p>Local Sichuan shops and the China National Products Company both sell Sichuan crepe.</p>

<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>A restaurant in Shanghai, with a Japanese-sounding name, claims to promote women's employment by recruiting young women to work as waitresses. It is said that on opening day, there was heavy traffic at the door, and business was booming. Many young men, whose intentions were not simply about the food, flocked to it. After reading Ah Qiu-jun's article "Impressions of a Large Dining Hall" in a newspaper supplement on the 21st of this month, I can't help but sigh! It turns out that the cutlery for Western food and the boat-shaped ashtrays on the tables are all (Made in Japan) products!</p>
<p>I advise my fellow countrymen not to be lured by the advertisement of female waitresses and to go instead to use our enemies cutlery. Go instead to well-known national product food companies such as Guanshengyuan and Taifeng Company! Driven by patriotism, I am writing this article to inform my compatriots and hope that the restaurant will change its ways and not use enemy goods, leaving a lifeline for domestic products!</p>

<h3 id="e232">Education News: Jiangsu Education Funds Borrowed <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Half a Month Issued First, Half a Month Issued in Early September</p>
<p>Jiangsu education funds, after the end of the semester and at the beginning of the school year, when schools start, have mostly borrowed funds in previous years due to the transition period. Now, with the start of the school year and the urgent need for funds, the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office has followed the usual practice of borrowing from the Jiangsu, China, and Jiaotong banks, borrowing 80,000 yuan from Jiangsu, 70,000 yuan from China, and 50,000 yuan from Jiaotong, totaling 200,000 yuan (China has replied that they will borrow as planned; Jiangsu and Jiaotong have agreed that they can borrow as planned after reporting to their head offices). With the addition of funds in the treasury, issuing one month's funds to provincial education institutions and schools is no longer a problem. However, the borrowing is still being negotiated, and the funds have not been completely delivered to the treasury. It is calculated that the funds already delivered to the treasury are short by thirty to forty thousand yuan if half a month is issued first. Currently, the bank is requested to advance the full amount of the loan, which will be deducted from it in the near future. The Education Fund Management Office will issue payment notices to the schools on the 28th and 29th of this month (the rural teachers and primary schools will receive the first half of August's funds; social education, vocational schools, and normal schools will receive the second half of July's funds; and middle schools will receive the first half of July's funds), which will be sent to the schools and education institutions separately. The schools will receive the funds around the end of the month or the beginning of the next month. The payment notices for the second half of the month's funds (the second half of August's funds for rural teachers and primary schools, and so on) have already been stamped by the Jiangsu Education Fund Auditors Committee on the 25th of this month. The 26th and 27th are holidays. On the 28th, the Education Fund Office will send them to the Education Department for stamping. They will probably reach the schools in early September, and at that time, the bank loan can be completely delivered to the treasury. This second half of the month's funds can be paid around September 10th, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Jiangsu Education Fund: Tax on Livestock and Teeth Likely Not Mortgaged for Public Bonds <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Fund Office Requests the Provincial Government to Address Public Doubts</p>
<p>Jiangsu education funds use land tax and the tax on livestock and teeth as dedicated funds for education, and a special office is set up to manage them. The education funds are completely independent. Recently, the Education Fund Management Office sent an official letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government regarding a report on August 21 stating that the Jiangsu Provincial Government planned to issue 30 million yuan in public bonds, with 14 million yuan earmarked for repaying old debts and 16 million yuan allocated to the Huai and Yun waterways projects and other uses. The guarantee fund would be the Jiangsu Province's stamp tax on brokerage and the salt surcharge, and the repayment period for the old debts would be extended by 19 years. However, these funds might not be sufficient, so in addition to the Huai and Yun waterways projects utilizing labor to save costs, the provincial government would allocate 300,000 yuan annually from the land tax to supplement them. The Executive Yuan had already submitted the case to the Ministry of Finance for review, and it was feared that these funds would not be sufficient to cover the costs. The letter explained that the tax on livestock and teeth had long been designated to be managed by the Management Office and earmarked for education, and could not be used as a guarantee fund for provincial public bonds. The office asked that the report, which it feared was a rumor, be verified and responded to, and that a correction be published in the newspaper to avoid confusing the public.</p>

<h3 id="e236">Venue Arrangement <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>The opening ceremony of the 11th Annual Meeting of the Economic Society was held at the Hunan University Library at 3 p.m. on the 26th. Hunan University is located in the mountains of Yuelu, with beautiful scenery, especially the magnificent library building surrounded by greenery. The flags of the party and the nation were crossed at the entrance. There were registration desks for members and guests at the entrance. The portrait of the Prime Minister and the flag of the party and the nation were hung high in the center of the auditorium. The platform was decorated with potted flowers, and the front of the platform was the press seat, with the member seats in the front few rows and the guest seats in the back.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Chairman's Address <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>The opening ceremony of the annual meeting was chaired by Ma Yinchu, the president of the society. After the ceremony, the chairman stood up and reported the purpose of the meeting, saying that the Chinese Economic Society was initiated and organized in 1924 by Professor Taylor of Yenching University in Peking. At first, there were very few people, and it was just a discussion group. Later, it was expanded under the leadership of Mr. Liu Dajun, so Mr. Liu was the founder of the society. The society was first in the north and then moved to the south, and the number of members has increased with each year. In the past few years, annual meetings have been held in Shanghai, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Qingdao, and Nanjing. This year it is in Hunan, and next year it is scheduled to be in Sichuan. The reason why the annual meetings of the Economic Society must be held in various places is that the theory is connected with the facts. If the facts have no theory, it is easy to make mistakes, and if only theory is held and the facts are not considered, it is even easier to make mistakes. Therefore, the annual meetings of the society are held in various places to take this opportunity to visit and investigate the economic situation in various places and use it as a reference and goal for research. At present, one-third of the society's members are scholars, and two-thirds are from the banking industry. This trip is to admire the construction of Hunan and visit Hunan Province, which is to study China's economy today with Chinese economics. As for the society's funds, it currently has more than 100,000 yuan, most of which is helped by government banks and the industrial sector, so in the future, the society's members will serve the country and society with their collective strength. If the country is rich, our society will also prosper, and if the industries in various provinces develop, the society will inevitably develop along with it. Now Hunan has a large number of mineral deposits such as coal and antimony, which will become a rich province once developed. The society will do its best to help Hunan, and Hunan will benefit the society in the future. Finally, he said that Mr. Sun Zhesheng, who the society had invited, was in Honolulu to escape the summer heat and could not attend the meeting due to the long distance, and now he asked Chairman He for guidance.</p>
<h3 id="e238">He Jian's Speech <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>After the Chairman's report, He Jian stood up and gave a speech, saying that the 11th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Economic Society was held in Hunan this year, and Hunan would be able to gain many practical benefits after the meeting. Moreover, all the attendees are famous figures in China's academic circles and economic experts. The provincial government and the general headquarters welcome you all. Please take advantage of the opening day of your conference today to present the general economic situation of Hunan and the plans for future economic development to you all. Hunan Province has a land area of 692,000 square miles, and the climate is mild and pleasant, with no extreme heat in summer and no severe cold in winter. Dongting Lake is located in the northern part of the province, and tributaries are distributed throughout the province. The minerals produced include antimony, with a production of approximately 12,935 tons, accounting for the first place in the country, and zinc, which can reach 15,000 tons. In addition, coal, calcium, silver, and other minerals are also produced in large quantities in Hunan. Agricultural crops include rice, with a production of 107 million dan, cotton, with a production of 168,000 dan, tung oil, with a production of 398,000 dan, and black tea, with a production of more than 200,000 dan. The population is 302 million, and the people are mostly simple, sturdy and hardworking. From this point of view, it is not impossible to develop the rich resources of Hunan with the hardworking people of Hunan. In reality, Hunan, like China as a whole, has various difficulties that limit its development. From the 22nd year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty to the end of Xuantong, Chen Baozhen and Yu Lianxiang successively governed Hunan and tried to discuss ways to increase revenue and lay the initial economic foundation of Hunan. However, due to water and drought disasters, from the years of the Republic of China to the 23rd year, Hunan suffered seven floods and three droughts, averaging one disaster every two years. Then, it suffered military disasters. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, every time a war broke out, Hunan was involved in the vortex and sacrificed. Therefore, from the beginning of the Republic of China to the 19th year, there were almost continuous wars. Therefore, since the Republic of China, Hunan's finances have been short by a huge sum of 38,329,000 yuan. Therefore, from the beginning of the Republic of China to the 7th year, the price of banknotes fell strangely, and the financial system was in chaos. The inventory of money was more than 50,000 strings. Originally, one string was worth 7 jiao and 3 fen and 2 li of silver, but it fell to 1 jiao per string. Such a change is alarming. There is also the impact of the external economy on the economy of Hunan. According to recent statistics, imports of foreign goods accounted for 55%, with an average of 8.3 million taels of customs duties, and native goods accounted for 59%, with an average of 4.75 million taels of customs duties. Exports were only 7.56 million taels. This is also one of the obstacles to the economic development of Hunan. The financial impact and the economic panic in China also affected Hunan. The world economic panic after the 19th year also affected the whole of China and Hunan. Therefore, Hunan's economy is facing many difficulties, and the government is unable to do anything about it. From the perspective of history, the above-mentioned diseases have not been stable since the beginning of the Republic of China to the 20th year, and a large amount of cash has flowed out, as much as 28,213,600 taels. Therefore, Hunan can hardly see cash. The export goods of the industry, the Changsha Yuezhou Customs in the 21st year of the Republic of China had only 4,384,672 taels, which is a decrease of 50% compared with the 17th year of the Republic of China. The reason is political instability, and the economy has also suffered a lot of blows in these years. After the 19th year of the Republic of China, the transportation industry, which was working hard to develop the economy, has completed 1,200 miles of highways, and 1,187 miles of branch lines have been developed in five years. 920 miles of earth roads have been completed, for a total of 3,287 kilometers of highways. There are now 200 long-distance buses running, and a 1,000-watt radio station has been built, and there are already several places with radio receivers installed. In terms of industrial construction, there is the Hunan First Textile Factory, with 50,000 spindles, and the Hunan Machinery Factory, alcohol coal vehicles and porcelain improvement. In terms of agriculture, an agricultural experiment field has been established, with more than 400 mu of fields and more than 400 mu of tea land. The cotton experiment field has 100,000 mu of cotton planting land. There are also tea experiment fields, a forestry bureau, and a national products display hall has been established for commerce. Relief and water conservancy have been done to some extent in practice. Such small undertakings cannot be said to be construction, but in Hunan today, where financial resources are scarce, it is felt that the achievements have been made to the best of their ability. The way to develop in the future is to stabilize the people's hearts and work hard to eliminate the Communist bandits. The territory of Hunan Province is stable, and recently there have been bandits who have fled into the province. They have now been surrounded and will soon be eliminated. To develop the rich resources of Hunan, we can only develop the countryside, because developing the countryside is the only way out today. This is not only the case for Hunan Province, but the entire China also needs this kind of work. However, developing the countryside must rely on capital, so He Jian is very hopeful that the Shanghai banking industry will invest in Hunan with its concentrated savings in Shanghai.</p>

It has been approved by the Executive Yuan and is allowed to be drawn from the first reserve fund item of the national education and culture expenses for the 23rd year. After review by the Directorate General of Budget, it was considered to be in order. The National Government has requested that the National Government file the case. Yesterday, the National Government instructed the Executive and Supervisory Yuan to separately instruct the Ministry of Finance, Education, and Audit to be informed.</p>

<p>Rich Exhibits, Especially the Most From Xinlu and Other Schools</p>
<p>The preparatory exhibition of achievements in labor science in primary and secondary schools in the city was held in the auditorium of Shangwen Primary School at 9 a.m. yesterday. Director Pan presided over the event, and Mayor Wu's representative delivered a training speech. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e242">A Glimpse of the Venue <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>The venue is divided into two locations, Shangwen and Xicheng. There are more than 7,000 exhibits from all primary and secondary schools, divided into 18 categories: paper crafts, wax crafts, bamboo crafts, woodworking, metalworking, rattan crafts, embroidery, weaving, sewing, carving, stone carving, sculpture, clay crafts, plaster crafts, agricultural works, household goods, chemical crafts, and applied crafts. Exhibits from various schools are displayed in more than 20 rooms, filled with a wide variety of beautiful things. In the secondary school section, the machines of the China Vocational School are displayed in two rooms, making a great spectacle. The various specimens of Xinlu Normal School collected more than 400 pieces, which is very rich. The embroidery of female schools such as Wuben, Aiguo, Chengdong, and Shanghai Women's Middle School, the antique bronzes of Jingye, the stone carvings of Yangjing, and the educational supplies of Shanghai Middle School all have their own special achievements. In the primary school section, Shangwen has the most exhibits, with exquisite models of various transportation and military equipment and animal shapes. The National Defense Museum of He'an, the instruments of Wanzhu, the inscriptions and brick carvings of the Times, the bamboo carvings of Takahashi, the weaving of Qingxi, and the rattan crafts of Yangcun are also full of meaning. From 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., more than 10,000 teachers and students from the city's normal schools and schools in the southern district of Shanghai went to visit both venues. The Shangwen Boy Scouts and the Public Security Bureau sent police to the venue to provide services, so the order was very good.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Opening Ceremony <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at 9 a.m. Among those in attendance were Mayor's representative Zhang Yuanruo, City Party Department representative Li Erbai, guest Jiang Jianyu, and representatives of teachers and students from various primary and secondary schools, totaling more than 500 people. Director Pan presided over the meeting, Yuan Zengyu was the master of ceremonies, and Chen Yu and Li Kun were the recorders. The ceremony was performed as usual. First, Director Pan reported on the purpose of the meeting, followed by speeches by Secretary Zhang, the representative of the City Party Department, Li Erbai, and guest Jiang Wenyu. Chen Bai, the director of the meeting affairs, reported. Then, photos were taken and the ceremony was completed.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Director's Report <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Director Pan's report briefly stated that today the Education Bureau is holding a preparatory exhibition of labor science achievements in primary and secondary schools in the city. The Ministry of Education will hold a national labor exhibition of primary and secondary schools, so it ordered each province and city to hold a preparatory exhibition first, select works, and send them to Beijing for display. The national exhibition has now been postponed to November. The city will hold an exhibition for three days starting today, divided into two parts. The secondary school section is in Shangwen, and the primary school section is in Xicheng. Compared with the number of primary and secondary schools in the city, the number of participants is certainly far from enough, but it is not bad to have so many schools participating in the first event. Because the Ministry of Education informed the provinces and cities that the exhibits must be sent to Beijing before September, and the preparation period coincided with the schools' vacation, there were fewer participants. Now, let me talk to you about the significance of labor. At present, labor science is a major subject in primary schools, and middle schools also attach importance to this part of the work. In the past, schools often focused on knowledge of writing, only knowing how to read with their brains and neglecting to use their hands and work to make things. Therefore, the current education is to remedy this shortcoming, so it pays attention to the combination of hands and brains. This is a trend in the change of direction of education. Why should there be this kind of change? Because everyone feels that the students trained by the schools are often unwilling to endure hardship and are prone to unemployment, so vocational education and production education are promoted to make students able to work and not suffer from unemployment panic. In order to inspect the labor achievements of primary and secondary schools, the Ministry of Education is holding an exhibition for mutual reference and observation and to seek improvement. I hope that the principals and students of each school will pay attention. All those who are engaged in labor science must understand that labor science focuses on labor work, not on books, and it is necessary to train students to be not afraid of labor work and give students the opportunity to do labor work. At present, each school lacks materials and there is no real achievement, and students do not regard labor as an important subject. It is hoped that each school will improve this.</p>

<p>Following this, Mayor Wu, representing Secretary Zhang, delivered a speech, stating that the Labor Exhibition held significant meaning, representing a shift in China's educational policy, and explaining the forward progress of Chinese national culture. He stated that Chinese history could be divided into two stages: one in the Yellow River basin and another in the Yangtze River basin. The Yellow River basin represented labor, while the Yangtze River basin represented non-labor, which was the cause of the decline of the Chinese nation. During the Yellow River period, both the upper and lower classes valued labor. The emperor made boats, carts, and palaces, which earned him the people's faith. Chinese culture then occupied an important position in the world. However, when the country moved to the Yangtze River basin, due to the self-importance of scholars, the so-called "scholars do not carry baskets, and successful candidates do not walk," a trend of non-labor was created, causing Chinese history to change direction. Until the end of the Qing Dynasty, general officials and gentry abolished the imperial examination system and created new schools to seek reform, but the result was the opposite. They were seduced by Western material civilization, and people's lives became more extravagant. Therefore, Chinese history was affected vertically by the non-labor trend of the Yangtze River basin, and horizontally by the seduction of Western material civilization, which brought the nation to its current state. Therefore, we must now create culture and improve people's lives by promoting labor, and restore China's inherent creative and scientific spirit so that culture can progress. Next, Li Erbai, the representative of the city's Party headquarters, gave a speech, followed by a speech from visiting guest Jiang Wenyu, and a report from Chen Bai, the director of the conference affairs, which were omitted.</p>

<p>Since Pudong Middle School began implementing summer military training, in addition to daily practice of drills and teaching of coursework, it has held three field exercises. Yesterday (the 29th) morning, Jiao Jihua, the director of Shanghai military training, made a special trip to the school for inspection. Zhu Jingqing, the military training instructor, led the guards to greet him in formation. Accompanied by Principal Lin, he inspected each company, platoon, training class, and the interior of the headquarters. Everything was neat, clean, and orderly. Director Jiao greatly praised this. Then, a military parade was held on the school's playground, with a reviewing stand erected in the center. A couplet was hung to the left and right of the front of the stand, inscribed with "Consolidate the army and strengthen the military, feed the horses and sharpen the weapons." The arrangements were extremely magnificent. During the inspection, the first company held rifles, and the second company was unarmed. All were fully dressed. After the commander issued the order, the exercise began amidst the melodious military music. The steps were neat, the spirits were full, and the military appearance was very strong. After the inspection, Principal Lin and Instructor Zhu invited Director Jiao to inspect the trenches built by the students of the first company. They were no different from the German style. Finally, they gathered in the auditorium, where Director Jiao gave an address, followed by encouragement from Principal Lin, a speech from Song Chongjiu, and a response from student representative Yuan Mingheng. The event ended at 12:00 PM.</p>

<p>(National News Agency) The Municipal Education Bureau recently received a complaint stating that someone had suddenly rented a house in Arui Lane, North Sichuan Road, hung up a school sign with the name "Mingzheng Primary and Secondary School," and posted advertisements to recruit students. Upon inspection, the school building was small, lacked equipment, and the person in charge did not seem to be from the education field. It was determined that unscrupulous people were using a false name to collect money. The bureau was asked to investigate. The Municipal Education Bureau has now sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau ordering a ban on the school, as there is no record of it, in order to avoid misleading young people.</p>

<p>Huang Yaozhong and Lian Xiaohu Each Win Three First Place Finishes</p>
<p>(Beijing Dispatch) The Beijing Municipal Public Swimming Competition was held at the Zhongnanhai Public Swimming Pool from 8:00 AM on the 26th. There were more than two hundred spectators. After the meeting began as scheduled, Vice President Cai Yuanzhi gave the opening speech, stating that this was the first public swimming competition for citizens in Beijing and that he was very happy that the athletes had actively participated. The history of swimming competitions in Beijing was short and the level was naive. This was because Beijing had paid little attention to promoting swimming in the past. The only swimming pool in Beijing, the public swimming pool, had only been established for two years. Citizens had not had many opportunities to practice swimming. Therefore, the results were also poor. He hoped that this swimming competition would encourage citizens' interest in swimming, and that there would be significant progress in the next competition. After Cai's speech, the competition began and ended at 12:00 PM. Prizes were then awarded. Vice President Cai Yuanzhi supervised the award ceremony, and competition committee member Ms. Wang Jingzhi presented the prizes. The winners included Huang Yaozhong and Lian Xiaohu, who were tied for first place in the men's open group overall score, Tao Yongzhong, who won first place in the men's beginner group, Shao Shifeng, who won first place in the women's group overall score, and Dong Mohong, who won second place. The results of the open group and women's group are recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e259">Where Are the Great Works? <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Hun Ren</p>
<p>Where have the great works gone? To this question, I can answer without hesitation: The great works are in the wastepaper basket!</p>
<p>Some people will surely find my answer strange, and they will question me like this: There are so many large and small publications in the country, they need many articles, needless to say, as long as the work is valuable, are you still afraid of not having the opportunity to publish it?</p>
<p>Yes, this is the ideal of most people, but ideals and reality are two different things. The reality tells us: The editors of various publications all embrace the "Monroe Doctrine." Their territory - the publication - is used to solve the eating problems of their related relatives and friends. They are worried about "too many monks and not enough porridge," where can they spare a grain for others? Therefore, when your manuscript is sent to them, and they find that the manuscript is signed with the name of someone unrelated to them, they don't even bother to take a look and stuff it into the wastepaper basket.</p>
<p>It is so difficult to submit a casual manuscript, let alone publish a single book or collection. The bookstore owners are all extremely snobbish. They accept manuscripts based on "name." There is no problem in selling the copyright or collecting royalties for the manuscripts of famous writers. Many of them have already been reserved after just deciding on a book title, without knowing what the content is. However, they treat unknown writers whose status is below average very differently. When the manuscript seller approaches their desk, they size you up with their eyes hidden behind their glasses, then look at your rectangular newspaper package, and before you can open your mouth, they complain about a series of hardships - the book industry is in a slump, the countryside is bankrupt, losing money... and from time to time they add a few ha ha, hahaha... of sinister laughter, even more cruelly frightening, simply leaving the person standing next to him no chance to open his mouth.</p>
<p>The editors and bookstore owners are certainly to blame for the creation of this abnormal phenomenon, but the main reason is not entirely with them, but with the general blind readers, because they are a group of pitiful insects without any preconceived notions, holding the principle of only reading the works of famous writers. When the literary giants say that humorous articles are good, they read humorous magazines and books; when they say that sketches are good, they then choose to read sketches. In short, they say that literary giants’ farts smell fragrant. As for the works of unknown writers, they simply don't bother to take a look, as if it would be harmful to them after reading them. Bookstore owners are profit-oriented, and editors want their jobs to be stable, so they have to cater to the tastes of readers, specializing in publishing books by famous writers or inviting a few famous writers to be special writers to try to save face. In this way, the works of unknown writers are undoubtedly buried and silenced.</p>
<p>Although, we cannot say that the works of famous writers are all worthless, and the works of unknown writers are all great. The fact that famous writers can stand on the literary scene naturally means they have their skills. In addition, because of their deep experience and extensive reading, the works they write are of course not bad. However, because they are famous, bookstore owners come to reserve books one after another, and editors urge them to submit manuscripts every issue, so they are burdened with literary debts, but they have to perfunctorily deal with all parties. In this way, there are naturally very few brilliant works. Moreover, any famous writer has a limited number of great works in his life, and most of the great works are early works, because they became famous by relying on their early great works, in other words, by relying on their unknown works. From this point of view, the works of unknown writers cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>But what is the current situation? The great literary giants can only create perfunctory works; the contributors to various publications - those related to the editors - are only counting words, calculating how much money they can exchange for? The works of unknown writers can only be stuffed into the wastepaper basket. In this way, how can great works appear?</p>
<p>Many unknown writers, because there is no way to advance, those with ambition are angrily "throwing their pens to become farmers" or "throwing their pens to become workers." Those with weak wills go to the doors of literary giants, hoping to get their support. However, most literary giants want both fame and fortune, so where do they care about the life and death of others? As a result, the entire literary scene is filled with "smog"!</p>
<p>So I say that the great works are in the wastepaper basket, I am afraid I am not exaggerating!</p>
<h3 id="e260">What Kind of National Products Year Will Next Year Be Called? <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Ge</p>
<p>Last year was called National Products Year, and this year is called Women's National Products Year. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>I heard that the reason is very big, and there are many reasons: First, National Products Year was too general. The reason why National Products Year did not achieve results last year was because no one was specifically responsible. Naturally, this year the women's circle must take on the specific responsibility and start over. Second, women are the masters of household consumption, and many high-priced goods are consumed on their bodies. It is very good as long as they like to consume national products. In short, the main idea is that Women's National Products Year is actually much more practical and effective than National Products Year. Therefore, after National Products Year, there is another Women's National Products Year.</p>
<p>Isn't it like there is a what's girl's middle school or university after a what's middle school or university?</p>
<p>No, no, definitely not! That is a manifestation of a little bit of not recognizing women's personality. Women are social people just like men. Why are all the nouns that are common to everyone monopolized by men? For example, the distinction between he and she is an example. This is completely drawing women outside the general population and not treating women as social people. As for Women's National Products Year, it is different. It can be said that the meaning is completely opposite: it not only calls women to the society to become a social person, but also calls women to represent the general population to take on a part of the special responsibility of saving the country. This is such a worthy of joy thing! Therefore, since the new year came, here is also shouting Women's National Products Year, there is also shouting Women's National Products Year, as if everywhere is booming.</p>
<p>However, recently it seems that I have not smelled the boom. The results are probably still very good.</p>
<p>Um. According to the statistics recently released by the International Trade Bureau, it is like this: First, within six months of this year, the imported cosmetics and appliances consumed by women in our country are worth about 970,000 yuan. Second, the imported lace used by women to embroider cheongsams is worth about 600,000 yuan. Third, the imported spearmint gum consumed by Shanghai women in six months is worth about 238,000 yuan. Various other things that have not yet been published are probably also very considerable. Moreover, it is said that these imported consumables are mostly consumed by the aristocratic families and general fashionable women in Shanghai. However, weren't these women the ones who shouted Women's National Products Year before? It can be seen that these women's Women's National Products Year still has no results to speak of.</p>
<p>Then, next year, try using the laboring women who can only eat and dress and do not consume these consumables at all as representatives, and call it Laboring Women's National Products Year?</p>
<p>This, naturally, still has no results to speak of. First of all, these women will not do it like this. Whether other women want them to represent them is a secondary issue. However, the main problem lies here: if foreign rice, wheat, and cotton cloth are still pouring in, then soon not a bit of national product will be found on and in these women's bodies and stomachs. The resulting results are probably still the same as those obtained by women who apply cosmetics, wear lace, and chew spearmint. In fact, even what the current laboring women eat and wear is not mostly rice, wheat, and cotton cloth from the Great Republic of China, which is based on agriculture. In this way, it seems that no suitable person can be found to take specific responsibility for next year's National Products Year at all.</p>
<p>I think there are many National Products movers who are now hesitating about a question: What kind of National Products Year should next year be called?</p>

<p>He settled me on the bed, then scrutinized me heavily again, shook his head, and sighed.</p>
<p>"This is no joke. You must go to the hospital quickly, Li!"</p>
<p>I still didn't speak, and closed my eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was going to tell you, I went to the bookstore the day before yesterday to ask on your behalf, and they said they wouldn't use your manuscript. They said they were very sorry."</p>
<p>"Won't use it?" I almost shouted, but I didn't have the strength, and just glanced at him.</p>
<p>"Never mind if they don't use it," my friend consoled, continuing, "Go to the hospital today, okay?"</p>
<p>I glanced at him weakly again, without making a sound.</p>
<p>My friend seemed to finally understand my heart at this moment. He hesitated for a while, then asked:</p>
<p>"How much money do you have left? I have three dollars here. If it's not enough, take some clothes,..." He looked at me with feeling.</p>
<p>Instead, I gave a cold laugh. I didn't understand what I should do. I loved my life, but my only hope was cut off. I could only use my life to collide, to collide anywhere. I said resolutely:</p>
<p>"I have nothing, only that suit, you can take it."</p>
<p>He looked at me hesitatingly for a while, and finally stood up, "I'll go pawn it, we'll talk about it later if it's not enough."</p>
<p>He took my only property from the wall.</p>
<p>By the time he returned, it was already afternoon. As soon as he stepped into the door, he smiled bitterly at me, "Damn it, it's really worthless, only pawned for two dollars." After a while, without waiting for me to speak, he continued as if to comfort me: "It's almost enough, let's go to JX Hospital, you only need to pay a little money there. Let's go, I've already called a rickshaw at the door."</p>
<p>I should be grateful for Da's kindness. I also smiled bitterly and got out of bed, although I felt that poor people entering hospitals wouldn't cure their illnesses, I couldn't help but take a chance.</p>
<p>I held onto Da, went downstairs, and helped Da into the rickshaw.</p>
<p>Along the way, there was wind, there was sun, I lay straight in the rickshaw, my whole body seemed to be falling apart. The sky was spinning, the earth was spinning, everything was spinning....</p>
<p>However, I endured it, because I was going to the hospital.</p>
<p>The hospital's hideous iron gate was half-closed, the entrance was full of red and green paper, perhaps this was another grace of God, this hospital belonged to God.</p>
<p>Da helped me through the side door to the registration room. Before we could speak, a young man sitting at the entrance of the registration room stopped us and asked, "What do you want?"</p>
<p>"Register, see a doctor," Da replied.</p>
<p>"Special registration is five dollars."</p>
<p>"We want to register for a regular appointment."</p>
<p>"No, today is X holiday."</p>
<p>I don't know when I was spinning again in the wind and sun, I don't know when I lay down again in that gloomy attic, drowsily closing my eyes, all hope was gone.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Younger Brother (4) <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Wen</p>
<p>However, my younger brother's brute strength is sometimes very useful. Once, not far from the entrance, when I was being bullied by a classmate, I blushed and raised my hand, but this classmate was not afraid, and still stood directly in front of me, making many of the people around me laugh. But my younger brother came up wielding a large weighing pole, shouting loudly, and from afar, I could hear the clanging sound of the iron weighing hook hitting the weighing pole. That classmate turned tail and ran, and my younger brother chased after him for more than ten steps. The people watching naturally laughed again, but the meaning of this laughter was different from before.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in helplessness, my mother would stop the needlework in her hands, open her eyes with a faraway look, and murmur to herself, comforting herself:</p>
<p>"The fortune teller said that I will have good luck in ten years, and you two brothers are one civil and one military, ten years..."</p>
<p>Although it was ten years, the fleeting smile on my mother's lips seemed to indicate that it was not too long. However, after this, she felt that she had to send my younger brother to school no matter what. She would even lock him in school, and sit and wait for these "ten years"! After all, because of money, my younger brother and I could only each go to a different school, he was classmates with those barefoot children. In less than a year, I saw him read five copies of the Three Character Classic until they were worn out. How the teacher in that school taught, and how the students read, only God knows. When I came home on summer vacation from another county, I heard my mother say that the teacher liked to smoke opium, and my younger brother was often dragged back from the small river dripping wet.</p>

After the opening, although banks were bullish, the situation lingered because the sales intentions of fellow traders were very strong. Afterwards, because HSBC's listed prices did not change and banks' appetite remained bullish, the situation was very stable, but the price fluctuations were extremely small and the market hovered for a very long time. Until the Central Bank opened spot transactions, Reuters reported that reliable sources said that the French government had not paid attention to reducing the value of the franc and decided to maintain the gold standard, hoping to strengthen the franc's position, etc., the gold market stabilized, and banks continued to close positions.

<p>August</p>
<h3 id="e269">Government Bond Delivery and Its Process <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>The Total Amount Reached 53.95 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Market Price Soared Initially, But Suddenly Plunged Later</p>
<p>With a Difference of Six to Ten Yuan in High and Low Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, August 29, was the delivery date for the August futures of the Chinese Securities Exchange. The total delivery amount was 53.95 million yuan. Excluding the amount allocated for self-delivery by various brokers, which was 41.09 million, the amount delivered at the exchange was only 12.86 million. Although the total amount increased compared to the previous few days, it was not the actual situation, because the amount of off-market deliveries by various brokers must also be considerable. This time, the quantity increased due to some arbitrage transactions that were not swapped, which was also related to the tightening of credit. After the August futures were launched on June 29, the market price soared in early July, repeatedly reaching new highs, and the market was extremely good. On the 23rd, regarding the trading that started on June 29, the price immediately rose by more than 4 yuan and stopped auctioning, with a price of 82 yuan. On the 26th, there were even restructuring rumors, reaching a high of 20.09 yuan. The highest price for troop reduction was 82.5 yuan, and the highest price for salt tax was 63.95 yuan. The high market price was unmatched for a while, and it was considered the highest price of the year. Among them, many types of treasury bonds were also the latest high prices since the 16th year of the Republic of China. The reasons for this, apart from the rumors of restructuring for the 26th year of the Republic of China, were nothing more than embellished and exaggerated, so the rise and fall were not worth mentioning. In addition to the reasons mentioned above, the initial reasons for the rise were related to the Ministry of Finance's investigation of bank reserves, followed by the progress of the North China issue. The North Gang had the strongest buying appetite, and the fourth number also bought very enthusiastically. Later, due to the Min rebellion, the tense situation of the Japanese war, the outflow of cash, and the gradual tightening of credit, as well as other rumors, the market price fell from a high level. The lowest price for troop reduction was 76 yuan, and the price was even smaller by 45 yuan in September. The lowest salt tax was 58 yuan, and the price was even smaller by 23 yuan in September. The difference between high and low prices was 6 to 10 yuan, which was quite alarming. In terms of future trends, if credit tightens further and cash outflow continues, the market price may continue to fall. The August futures delivery, clearing, and total transaction volume are listed below (unit: 100 yuan). Today, the auction of October futures trading will be added.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (August 28), the New York stock market was unusually stagnant, with prices mixed and slightly lower. The public was generally unwilling to trade before Labor Day. Gold and silver stocks turned firm at the close, and copper and iron stocks also stabilized due to general expectations of progress in the steel industry after the holidays. Small exchanges and bond markets saw mixed gains and losses. Rumors that the Ministry of Finance would redeem the $52.5 million in bonds due on September 15 with cash made U.S. government bonds extremely strong. Chicago wheat fell due to bullish investors selling off in disappointment due to lack of support. The total daily trading volume was 400,000 shares.

<p>| Another Yuan or More Drop |</p>
<p>Financial Gang Bulls Gradually Spit Out</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants' Short Positions Have Not Been Covered</p>
<p>The yarn market initially flattened and then fell due to the sluggish spot yarn sales. The entire day, only 230 bales were purchased by various gangs. This situation has not been seen for many days. In addition, the news was bad, and the sellers took the opportunity to actively pressure the market, making it even more difficult for the bulls to stabilize. The amounts previously absorbed by the money shop gangs have been spit out, reportedly one-third of the amount. A large number of foreign merchants' short positions have not yet been covered. The October contract has broken through the 80 yuan mark. Tomorrow is delivery, and the cotton yarn market will be closed.</p>

<p>The bid yarn market opened strong in the morning. Because U.S. cotton rose slightly, and prices had fallen for two consecutive days, most people expected a rebound. Therefore, the opening price rose by 2.3 jiao. Bids were flat until the second and third rounds, but buying interest was weak. As a result, the prices for each month rose by 1.2 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that the spot yarn transaction was only 230 bales, and a certain Guangdong Gang bull closed its position at the market price, causing the market to suddenly fall. The October contract also broke through the 80 yuan mark. As a result, prices for each month fell by 1.2.3.4 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 55,000 bales. It was found that Dafu sold 2,150 bales, Tongji 1,900 bales, Mingde 950 bales, Changfeng 2,000 bales, Changji 850 bales, Huikang 800 bales, Senkang 1,150 bales, Taichang 1,300 bales, and Hengchang 750 bales. Dafeng bought 3,100 bales, Jinchang 1,500 bales, Renfeng 2,150 bales, Deji 900 bales, Daji 800 bales, Yuande 1,750 bales, and Xincheng 2,000 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>The sales of spot yarn were exceptionally quiet. The total amount purchased by various gangs throughout the day was only 230 bales. The market was weak. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below:</p>

<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. The market sentiment was stronger than the yarn market because the amounts absorbed by general speculators were never released. The short positions of Dafu were gradually being covered, so the surface was tighter. However, the selling prices of new cotton from various routes were gradually decreasing, which was cheaper than the bid cotton price. The factories were slow to buy because the yarn market was not prosperous.</p>

<p>The previous cotton market opened with American cotton rebounding by ten points.  Sellers were still scarce, and market sentiment remained tight.  The second and third rounds of trading saw another rise, but the current month remained unchanged.  Further out months rose by 1.2 candareens.  In the afternoon, news arrived that new Yao cotton was offered at 0.6 candareens lower than the previous day, with few buyers.  At the same time, the yarn market saw a major fall, greatly weakening confidence.  Selling pressure intensified, resulting in a further decline of 0.25 to 0.3 candareens across all months.  The total volume of transactions for the day was 84,700 piculs.  Sales included Dafeng (2,700 piculs), Tongji (3,000 piculs), Hengyi (1,000 piculs), Xinxing (1,300 piculs), Changhe (1,600 piculs), Shenchang (2,200 piculs), Junchang (6,100 piculs), Dachang (1,600 piculs), and Xiesheng (1,100 piculs).

<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after trading opened in the morning, all months showed signs of weakness.  Overseas wheat quotations showed declines of approximately 0.12 candareens in Chicago and 0.05 to 0.06 candareens in Canada.  At the open, market participants were influenced by continuous rains in the interior and the halt in sales to the north, as well as consecutive days of falling overseas wheat prices.  As a result, confidence was extremely weak, and prices fell by about 0.02 candareens compared to the previous day.  However, short covering caused a recovery of 0.01 candareens by the close.  When trading reopened in the afternoon, all months showed further declines.  Reports indicated that Australian wheat prices had also returned to 5.60 yuan.  Local factories' flour sales were unexpectedly weak.  It was claimed that the disruption of river transport in various locations had naturally halted flour demand, and that even Tianjin and other regions were experiencing inability to purchase due to rural bankruptcy.  Consequently, there were rumors of deliveries, and longs were forced to liquidate.  Distant months also declined sharply as major factories actively sold.  Given the weak physical sales, further declines are likely.  As a result, the current month fell by 0.055 candareens compared to the previous day, September fell by 0.0525 candareens, October fell by 0.0575 candareens, November fell by 0.05 candareens, December fell by 0.045 candareens, and January fell by 0.0375 candareens.</p>

<p>Resulting in the Decline of [Futures] Wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat market opened in the morning, all nearby and distant months fell uniformly, and selling pressure was intense. Confidence was extremely weak due to further declines in imported wheat prices, falling by 0.05 to 0.06 candareens to 0.12 candareens, and a return of Australian wheat prices to 5.60 yuan. The market price gradually approached that of Shanghai, but factories were uninterested in imported wheat due to sluggish flour sales. Even spot wheat was being withheld in anticipation of lower prices. Because of the decline in spot imported wheat prices, marked wheat saw aggressive selling by hoarders, leading to declines month after month. The market was even weaker in the afternoon. By the close, September was down 0.07 candareens, October was down 0.09 candareens, November was down 0.1 candareens, December was down 0.08 candareens, and January was down 0.12 candareens. Factory demand for spot wheat was very sluggish, with intentions to wait for further price declines. As a result, there were no transactions for the entire day.</p>
<h3 id="e282">High-Quality White Rice Hoarded by Merchants <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>Unwilling to Sell at the Price Ceiling</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, only thirteen or fourteen shipments arrived from various regions (totaling over 2,000 dan). Sales were sluggish, resulting in further price declines of several cents to about a dime for thick-grain and late-season rice. Only Du Yangjian and Yinyuan remained stable due to low supply. Special-grade rice experienced price declines of over 0.2 candareens due to plentiful arrivals from various locations and limited sales. The factories were specifically offering 11.8 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, fourteen or fifteen shipments arrived from various regions along the river, but sales were slow for all varieties. High-quality white rice was unavailable for sale because merchants were unwilling to sell at the price ceiling of 13.5 yuan. The market saw price declines of 0.2 to 0.3 candareens for white rice and thin rice, and 0.1 candareens for Baiyuan new premium-grade rice. Yangdujian also trended weak. Arrivals of Dongxin glutinous rice were relatively strong, but sales were weak, with prices falling by 0.2 candareens.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Zhejiang Rice Prices Plunge After Rainfall <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>Declines Range from 0.3 to 0.6 Candareens</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for imported early rice was uniformly down, with light trading, weak confidence, and the likelihood of further declines. At the opening yesterday, prices for all grades of imported rice were expected to decline because customers from Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and other areas of Zhejiang province had received reports of rainfall in their regions and were returning home. Physical demand immediately halted. Even brokers acting as agents were mostly watching the market. Total purchases from interior merchants were only about 1,000 bags. Local merchants bought opportunistically, but only purchased a little over 1,000 bags in total. As a result, small-grain rice fell by 0.5 to 0.6 candareens, machine-milled rice fell by 0.4 to 0.5 candareens, and brown rice also fell by 0.3 to 0.4 candareens. Road shipments also fell by 0.4 candareens. Dealers in imported rice warehouses were watching the market, and Saigon rice had already arrived at the port, with road shipments also expected to arrive soon. Physical buyers and interior customers were mostly selling their futures contracts. Backdoor trading in Saigon rice had already fallen by 0.1 to 0.2 candareens. There were few sellers of small-grain rice, so prices were temporarily stable.</p>
<h3 id="e284">New Sesame from Yangzhou Falls Another 0.5 Yuan <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>The Situation for New and Old Soybeans is Not Good</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of new sesame from Yangzhou fell another 0.5 yuan, opening at 6.1 yuan, with 70 bags traded, purchased by local merchants. The weakness of the new sesame market was caused by the large amount of arrivals when old sesame was being turned over, which were all high-quality. New sesame itself is inferior to other sesame, so demand is low. In addition, arrivals continue, so in just one week since its listing, its price has fallen by 1.4 yuan. The market for new and old yellow soybeans is not good. Sales of new soybeans were less than 500 bags, so prices continued to fall. Old soybeans were not selling at the sesame oil factories, and there was no market revival.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Dried Goods, Old Longan Experiences a Major Price Drop <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>The existing inventory of old longan was extremely low. Based on previous years' sales, it was expected that it would not last until the new crop. However, sales this summer were significantly reduced due to drought, with only sporadic transactions. As a result, new longan has already arrived, but the old crop has not yet been sold. Therefore, the market price has plummeted. The current market price for ordinary large-kernel longan, previously offered at around 60 yuan, is now only 36 to 37 yuan, a decrease of 23 to 24 yuan. Those with large inventories are mostly suffering losses.</p>

<p>Prices for Lyon Raw Silk are Extremely Low. Japan had abundant spring and summer silkworm harvests this year, leading to a sharp increase in silk production. Japanese silk merchants are aggressively dumping cheap silk on European and American markets. Recently, prices for Lyon raw silk have been extremely low. Zhong Shenhai Cup brand is only 39.5 francs per kilo, and special grade Eight Arrows brand is only 42 francs (both 13/15 denier), which is 12 to 13 francs lower than Chinese silk from Shanghai white factories. As a result, sales of factory silk in France remain difficult.</p>
<p>Few Hangzhou-Shaoxing Cocoon Waste Shipments to Shanghai. Silk weaving factories in the interior are starting to weave winter semi-silk fabrics, leading to a sharp increase in demand for cocoon waste for long spinning. There are few shipments of Hangzhou-Shaoxing cocoon waste. This month, a total of only 73 pieces were shipped from the Communist region.</p>
<p>The Foreign Silk Market Remains Weak. Recently, overseas markets and sales of raw silk from factories have shown no improvement. Shanghai Chinese silk merchants report that the prices offered by European and American white silk factories are still more than 100 yuan below cost, resulting in huge losses. They are watching the market and not selling. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others imported 20 bales of white factory silk and 10 bales of white silk yarn, with prices remaining weak.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign tea market saw resumed purchases of green tea, such as needle and special grade tea, by British firms such as Jinlong, Xiehe, and Fushi, due to demand from Morocco. Total sales for the city were over 800 boxes. High-grade teas sold for 40 to 51 yuan, and low-grade teas sold for 16 to 22 yuan, both down 2 to 3 yuan from before. As for fine eyebrow green tea, European firms only made sporadic purchases, and there was no significant market progress. There were also no major transactions for Gongxi and Gongzhu teas. It is difficult to be optimistic about the green tea market.</p>

<p>Due to the suspension of export shipments, business in this street for American galvanized iron is scarce, so the market is unusually weak and prices are secretly declining.

<h3 id="e289">Concern for People's Food and Rural Relief <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>This year the weather is scorching, with a prolonged drought, especially severe in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi. Fields are cracked, and rice crops are withered, indicating a disaster. Shanghai rice prices have therefore risen repeatedly. What used to be six or seven yuan per picul is now selling for twelve or thirteen yuan per picul, almost doubling. However, the population of over three million still needs to eat, and they can only sigh as rice prices rise, handing over stacks of silver dollars to rice shops. Thus, everywhere under the scorching sun, countless farmers are weeping as they sweat to bail water while watching the withered rice crops. Workers in the city are groaning under the heavy burden of rising rice prices. But those wealthy merchants who purchased and hoarded rice cheaply last year under the guise of a "bumper harvest" are sitting by electric fans, squinting and smiling happily at the influx of wealth flowing their way.</p>
<p>There's no need to "hold a pipa halfway and cover your face" and hide anything. To be honest, in times of drought and disaster, the sweat and tears of the broad masses are the source of nourishment for these wealthy merchants who sit high and speculate. "Concern for people's food" has become a good opportunity for rice merchants to get rich. But nobody admits it, always offering explanations and excuses. The issue of whether or not Shanghai should buy imported rice is a farce of this kind.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai rice prices soared, the soybean and rice industry has suggested ordering 500,000 piculs of imported rice and requesting the government to waive import duties. This matter has attracted serious attention from all parties. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Grains Guild, and the Inland Rice Merchants Association of Changsha have all held meetings, issued declarations, and sent telegrams, arguing that there is no need to purchase imported rice and requesting the central government to strictly prohibit it. Those who advocate purchasing imported rice say: disaster has struck, people's food is at risk, rice prices are soaring, the people cannot bear the heavy burden, and imported rice should be purchased duty-free to suppress rice prices and help people's food. And this is also presented as a great patriotic and benevolent principle.</p>
<p>For members of the same industry to engage in mutual attacks, is it truly out of a dispute over the issue of "concern for people's food and rural relief"? This is somewhat doubtful. Those who have already hoarded a lot of rice, or inland rice merchants who own grain themselves, naturally rejoice at the rise in rice prices and hope they will continue to rise. The import of rice hinders their attempt to raise market prices. They shout that purchasing imported rice destroys the countryside and affects the national economy, without seeing that they are not reducing rice prices to "maintain people's food." As for those who advocate purchasing imported rice, they see the high rice prices and the potential for profit, and they are eager to obtain tariff exemptions to make a big deal. So they are seizing the opportunity, using "suppressing rice prices and helping people's food" as a pretext to purchase imported rice as much as possible. The recent transaction of 160,000 piculs of Saigon rice is a case in point.</p>
<p>In fact, are those who oppose the purchase of imported rice truly helping the countryside? Not to mention that farmers generally sell all their rice at low prices after the autumn harvest due to the pressure of rents, debts, and taxes. The fact that rice prices are being hoarded and raised to obtain high profits shows their intentions. And are those who purchase imported rice truly concerned about people's food and suppressing rice prices? We see that the recent transaction of 160,000 piculs itself indicates that they are waiting for a good price to sell, which also shows their true intentions and has nothing to do with "helping people's food." This is the cleverness of 20th-century people. It is clear that everyone is taking advantage of this disaster to "loot a burning house," but they still put on a lot of pretenses. But those with discerning eyes can always recognize that their so-called "concern for people's food and rural relief" is purely a way to beautify the "business principles" of profiting from disaster!</p>
<h3 id="e290">On "Literary Heritage" and "Foreign Eight-legged Essays" <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Mingtang</p>
<p>I admire the abilities of the "Literature" group of people.</p>
<p>I recently saw a copy of "Literature" Volume 2, Number 6, "Special Issue on the Study of Chinese Literature." At the beginning were two short articles discussing the issue of Chinese literary heritage. Their opinion was that Chinese literary heritage is worth organizing. Chinese literary heritage has countless grains of gold hidden in a desert: this gold is just waiting for us to unearth it. We need to sort through the countless Chinese literary heritages, pick out what we need (meaning like this, because the original text is not on hand, unable to quote the original sentence). I felt very strange at the time. What we currently need seems to be literature that can express contradictions (contradictions in objective reality) and resolve contradictions. But at this time, "Literature" is perversely proposing to organize Chinese literary heritage and accept Chinese literary heritage. What does this mean? So at that time, I casually wrote a short commentary, which was published in the "Commentary" column of this publication. My opinion is: Chinese literary heritage, indeed, is worth organizing. But now is not the time for us to leisurely organize Chinese literary heritage and accept Chinese literary heritage, right? So my conclusion is: the "Literature" proposal to organize Chinese literary heritage and accept Chinese literary heritage is just a more clever way to escape reality and escape contradictions. There will be no other meaning besides this. At that time, I wrote that article, originally not expecting anyone to "particularly value" it, and the "Literature" group would not "particularly value" my so-called "foreign eight-legged essay" that was not worth "particularly valuing." Unexpectedly, "Literature" actually superficially "did not particularly value" but valued my so-called "foreign eight-legged essay" that was not worth "particularly valuing." In "Literature" Volume 3, Number 2, I found an article signed by "Feng," titled ""Literary Heritage" and "Foreign Eight-legged Essays"." They launched a good attack on my article. His conclusion is: my article is a complete "foreign eight-legged essay"; secondly, the reason why they proposed organizing Chinese literary heritage and accepting Chinese literary heritage is said to be in order to "throw bombs into the old Chinese literature camp"! and carry out a "disinfection" movement for Chinese literature. In this way, their proposal to organize Chinese literary heritage and accept Chinese literary heritage has become a very "respectable" and meaningful work that is anti-"infatuation with old literature" and guides it to the road forward. This is a very clever "setting of words." However, everyone with discerning eyes can see it. Is this the fact? Alas, even a so-called "three-foot-tall child" would probably find it a little hard to believe. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e291">Random Notes from the Sickbed, Part 3 <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Red Tea</p>
<p>In the past, out of my own interest, I dabbled in old poetry, calligraphy, painting, and seal carving. Now, bored in my illness, I want to resume my old life, naturally aiming at leisure, but I am also afraid of exertion, which would be harmful to my sick body. Now let me write a little about the things of the past to quench my thirst by looking at plums.</p>
<p>In elementary school, my writing was very bad. When I was about to graduate, I still couldn't write better than a third-grade student. My father often said so to my face, but there was no way to write well.</p>
<p>Later, I happened to pull out a volume of Huang Shangu's calligraphy from the Sanxi Tang Calligraphy Collection and found it very pleasing. Especially the large-character "Poem Sent to My Forty-ninth Nephew." So I took a brush and copied it several times, and then practiced it again the next day. After several times, I showed it to a gentleman who studied calligraphy and painting. It was a real surprise! He actually said it was very good. Not only did he say it was good, but he also wrote a sentence in red ink on the paper: "There is much of the feeling of the B鶴銘 inscription." I went back and looked at the "B鶴銘 inscription" and it was indeed very much in line with it. So I diligently practiced the B鶴銘 inscription. The gentleman even came every day to correct it. It is true that calligraphy requires a hundred days of effort. After two months, it was actually quite presentable. The gentleman also wrote on the paper some sentences such as "The dots have the momentum of mountains collapsing stones, and the strokes have the beauty of clouds stretching for thousands of miles." This made me even happier. However, I had no foundation at all. From the beginning, I studied characters that relied purely on spirit. Although the brushwork was similar, I was ultimately unable to give my characters a complete composition. As a result, each character looked good individually, but the whole composition looked very bad, because the B鶴銘 inscription was already a remnant stele, with no connection between the characters or between the lines. At this time, I knew the danger, so I tried to learn Zhang Menglong and others, but to no avail. Later, I saw a copy of Huang Shangu's 在文 and Mu Yan Lu Gong's Sacrifice 文 drafts and found them very pleasing, so I took them to copy, but the accumulated habits were too deep and I could no longer completely correct them.</p>
<p>As for painting, I have always liked it. In the third grade of elementary school, I was able to paint Huang Zhong and Zhou Yu almost as well as the figures in the Illustrated Romance of the Three Kingdoms. While practicing the B鶴銘 inscription, I began to paint landscapes. At that time, I listened to the gentleman and learned Wang Hui, the leader of the Four Wangs, because his Zhongfeng Pi Ma wrinkles were the least flawed. But my gentleman was learning Ni Gaoshi's folded-belt wrinkles. Unintentionally, I followed the gentleman again and also learned the folded belt. This slowed my painting progress a lot. Later, I saw the works of Huang Heshanqiao and felt that his momentum was more imposing than Wang Hui, so I abandoned Ni Wang to learn from him. This made things worse and worse. Not long after, I flipped through the works of the monk Shitao on the easel and felt, "He is truly my teacher!" So I abandoned Huang Heshanqiao to learn from him. Although my temperament was similar and I was able to grasp his general idea, it was ultimately not good.</p>
<p>While learning to paint landscapes, I also saw the seal manual of Wanbai Shanren (Deng Shiru). I was excited for a moment and took out old iron brushes and stone seals to carve randomly from the drawer. At that time, I first wrote the characters on the stone seal with a brush, and then carved according to the characters. Later, I learned that carving this way was wrong, so I carved randomly with my hand. At this time, I was looking at too many miscellaneous seal manuals, so my seal carving also suffered from the same problem as my calligraphy and painting.</p>
<p>As for the last three years, because I have been running around, I haven't held a brush for a long time. What's more, at this time of carnage and bloodshed, new art is waiting to be learned and developed. At this time, talking about ancient seal carving, calligraphy, and painting is really about being fascinated by a skeleton. But in my case, the accumulated habits have not been eliminated. Especially when I have nothing to do while sick, I unconsciously think of the pleasures of that time.</p>
<p>Finally, among modern young people of about my age, there are probably very few who have dabbled in these things. This is their good fortune, because I myself have indeed been immersed in old learning for too long and too widely, and my ideas have been greatly influenced by it. But what can I do?</p>
<h3 id="e292">Autumn Courtyard <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Gazing Tower</p>
<p>Early autumn has arrived, and while the pleasant weather brings a sense of comfort, a layer of melancholy inevitably covers the sorrowful heart. "Don't be so sentimental, winter and spring will follow autumn." Sometimes, I try to reason this way, hoping to dispel the shadows in my heart, but the shadows continue to grow longer with the passage of time. I foresee that before long, these shadows will engulf my entire heart once again.</p>
<p>The sweltering heat of summer makes people feel lazy and weary, longing day and night for the autumn breeze to dissipate the heat. In anticipation, autumn is almost like a merciful God, bringing almost nothing but blessings. It seems only autumn can save all living beings, lifting sinners from purgatory one by one.</p>
<p>Indeed, autumn has arrived as hoped. The shadows of the elm trees are thinly reflected on the window first, and the flowers and grass soon turn withered and yellow. The night breeze blows, bringing quiet, coolness, and freshness. We should be grateful for autumn, but instead, my heart sinks into deep sorrow.</p>
<p>We know that autumn is just one season of the year, like spring and winter, neither particularly joyful nor particularly sad. But people are so clever and yet so pedantic. When spring arrives, they are all smiles, seeking and cherishing the spring. But for autumn, they only grieve for it, even weep for it. The god of autumn and the messenger of spring are equally happy or equally without any intention of causing joy or sorrow. They are merely the changes of time, treating us people equally. But we people divide them into one lovable and one hateful.</p>
<p>In my childhood innocence, autumn was not so different from other seasons. In spring, we could make willow balls from willow branches; in summer, we could catch cicadas. In autumn, there were crickets chirping, enticing us to find them. All seasons were filled with joy and happiness. But as I grew older, even the Spring Festival, which I used to love, gradually lost its original joy. I only felt that another year had passed and I was another year older. In autumn, I gradually began to feel unhappy when I heard the wind and rain. People say I've grown up, but I say I've suffered more. Because the joy of catching crickets in those days is not only completely gone, but even hearing the chirping of autumn insects makes me feel sad. The heart of a happy childhood has long been buried deep by frequent sorrows.</p>
<p>Now, having lived a few more years in this world, looking at the lonely long sky in the autumn courtyard, my mood is as faint as the chirping of the little insects in front of the steps.</p>
<p>A person in the autumn realm is about to enter the autumn realm of life!</p>
<h3 id="e293">Within the Autumn Banana Scars <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Yin</p>
<p>The green banana leaves, exposed to long hours of sunlight, dew, wind, and rain, bear scars that intertwine with various hidden states of anger, love, leisure, and sorrow – the elusive emotions of a maiden. They reveal elements akin to ice and charcoal. Who would have thought that the harsh stripping of this crisp autumn season would destroy its long-held plans for expansion, leaving only a few breaths of abandoned children for us to grieve with?</p>
<p>It feels fortunate not to have withered before the fragrant osmanthus, and to be able to enjoy the sight of newly fertilized chrysanthemums. But the beauty of the eastern fence, and the stirring of the hero's spirit, pierce its weak life, storing the intention of recovery. Indeed, although it is only a few pieces of fragmented green, it never forgets its efforts in imagining the opportunities for its future.</p>
<p>The wind blows in gusts. The sound of leaves rustling echoes from the four neighbors. The peeling of the autumn paulownia, accompanied by the tearing of the decaying banana leaves, forms a mutual tune. The weak grass beneath its tall stem, for the hope of survival, is willing to sacrifice the precious moisture of the thick dew, begging it to preserve its only remaining strength to shelter it.</p>
<p>For the trust of its kind, for the survival of life, it has no choice but to struggle with tears. The self-defensive battle with autumn! It will completely sacrifice its beauty, and that is because it is driven by anger.</p>
<p>The autumn moon pours out its crystal-clear color, as if it will tie together all spirits and become the universe's deep silence. The cold cicada weeps! It feels the coldness of the autumn dew. It, the banana, under this moon where falling paulownia flowers break the silence, only has the movement within the stillness to accompany it through the long night, lamenting its encounter with fate.</p>

<p>— Zang Fei</p>
<p>The quiet evening of July, with its chilling drizzle, weighed down on every depressed heart. I walked aimlessly on the slippery road, a shadow swaying beside me under the dim streetlights. A hand reached out from behind.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" I grabbed a skinny arm! He opened his startled eyes and said in a pleading tone, "Good lady! Let me go! I'm hungry, I need to eat!"</p>
<p>Looking at that innocent face, my hand loosened, and I sadly watched the shadow swallowed by the darkness: "He's only that young!"</p>
<p>Then, the voice "I need to eat" echoed stubbornly in my ears. This was familiar to me, and many emaciated faces floated before my eyes: I saw them grabbing withered yellow leaves and greedily putting them in their mouths; I saw them frantically eating the bloody child dragged back from the railroad tracks – it was reported in the newspaper last year, I forget where – parents, because of hunger and unable to bear killing their children themselves, put them on the railroad tracks, let them be crushed to death, and then dragged them back. I even saw them ending their vibrant lives with their own hands.</p>
<p>A bright light shone on me, and I had reached a busy road. Nothing was left behind except that innocent face, those startled eyes.</p>
<p>Cars rushed by frantically, and suddenly a thought burst into my mind: "If he had been born into a wealthy family, wouldn't he have had a bright and rosy childhood? But now, what has deprived them of their youth? What has deprived them of their right to exist?"</p>
<p>I walked silently to the school, saw the magnificent school gate, and thought of China's lack of talent, and of the wanderers drifting on the streets.</p>
<p>The rain was still falling, and the sky was dark with no stars.</p>

<h3 id="e295">Recovery of Loan Association Funds <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I have a difficult problem and request your help in resolving it. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>About forty years ago, my father left a loan association slip with a relative, claiming it was my father's handwriting. (Whether it is actually his handwriting is questionable, as I have never seen my father's handwriting.) At that time, I was not even born, and my mother had not yet married.</p>
<p>My father married my mother over thirty years ago, and then I was born. Three years later, my father unfortunately passed away, leaving my mother and me to depend on each other for the next twenty years, without ever knowing about this matter.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the relative, who had not been in contact with my family for decades, suddenly came to my house to demand the so-called loan association funds and said many unpleasant things, threatening to use the law to recover the debt. I felt deeply insulted and could hardly bear it. Just as I was at a loss, I suddenly remembered that your newspaper has an amateur correspondence column that can help us with all kinds of problems. I dare to present the details of this matter and ask you to answer the following questions. I await your reply with the utmost anticipation.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely, Zhen</p>
<p>The questions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In law, can a loan association slip be legally binding?</p>
<p>(2) If the loan association slip is indeed my father's handwriting, am I responsible for repayment?</p>
<p>(3) If a loan certificate from the Guangxu era can still be valid now, can this forty-year-old loan association slip also be valid?</p>
<p>(4) If a lawsuit unfortunately occurs, what should I do?</p>
<p>Answer: Your letter was received a long time ago, but I have delayed in replying because there are too many letters in backlog. I am not familiar with the term "loan association slip" you mentioned and am not sure if it means "IOU." However, since the other party intends to rely on this document to request the return of the debt, they undoubtedly possess a "right to claim." According to the current Civil Code, "The right to claim is extinguished if not exercised within fifteen years." The loan association funds have been outstanding for more than forty years and have not been demanded from you. Therefore, the right to demand payment has certainly been lost. Therefore, you don't need to worry. Whether the loan association funds exist or not, whether the slip is genuine or fake, it is no longer a matter of concern as the statute of limitations has expired. As for the other party wanting to file a lawsuit, either they have no legal knowledge at all, or they are trying to scare you because they think you are ignorant. You don't need to be afraid.</p>

<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>"Old Master Wu is..."</p>
<p>"Old Master will make a fair judgment..."</p>
<p>"Old Master Wu..."</p>
<p>The expected praises rang in Rich Gonggong's ears like thunder. Old Master Wu stroked his neat beard with a smile. He felt he had completed a satisfying masterpiece today.</p>
<p>Zhang Defu opened his mouth, he had won. At the same time, seeing Old Master Wu's proud hint, he hurriedly pushed Rich Sheng's shoulder and said:</p>
<p>"Thank you, Gonggong Wu, for coming in this hot weather!"</p>
<p>"It's nothing, nothing," Old Master Wu said indifferently, "Rich Sheng often comes to my house with your mother, don't become strangers within the family."</p>
<p>"We will, Gonggong Wu," Zhang Defu rushed to answer.</p>
<p>Old Master Wu stood up from the grand chair, fanning himself with a goose feather fan, and straightened his clothes. "Okay?" As if seeking everyone's consent, "We can go."</p>
<p>Rich Gonggong seemed to wake up from a dream. He was listening intently to the cursing from inside, and for a moment, he forgot to say a few polite words. Instead, Rich Sheng said:</p>
<p>"Gonggong Wu, wait until the sun goes down before leaving."</p>
<p>"Good boy! Someone is waiting for me at the Xinglong Tea House."</p>
<p>Old Master Wu took his hand and walked outside all the way, saying, "Would you like to come to my house to play?"</p>
<p>A group of people followed them out, with Rich Gonggong walking at the back with a sullen face.</p>
<p>The two black gate doors opened, and the neighbors who were poking their heads out quickly dodged aside. The sedan chair carriers carried the sedan chairs from under the shade of the trees to the front of the door. Everyone thanked Old Master Wu before getting into their respective sedan chairs and returning home. Rich Gonggong, however, stared blankly at the departing sedan chair shadows as if he had lost his soul, sighed deeply, turned around, and slammed the gate shut with hatred.</p>
<p>Many pairs of puzzled eyes were cast on the black gate doors. They never understood what the major event was that had brought the Zhang Defu family together today.</p>
<p>The sun slowly moved west from the gate doors, and the cicadas still chirped loudly in the distance. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e297">Lilian Harvey's Last Effort <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>Will Return to Europe If Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Excessive Publicity Can Cause Repercussions</p>
<p>It is strange that Lilian Harvey, the petite and graceful actress whom our Shanghai audiences generally like, seems to have some difficulty gaining a foothold in Hollywood. From various Hollywood film magazines, it seems that they do not express deep regret or sympathy for her impending failure. Moreover, since the general audiences or film critics in the United States do not overemphasize content and ideology as much as we do in Shanghai, this is indeed a difficult thing to understand. (However, one magazine said: "If we let her leave, it would be an unforgivable sin for Hollywood.") It is said that she recently filmed a movie (Serenade). If she does not succeed exceptionally in this film, she will no longer make a living in Hollywood. This may be a bold prediction, but it is something she told people herself. She said, "If this film is not a special success, then Hollywood and I are finished!"</p>
<p>Since seeing her first Shanghai screening of "Congress Dances," her beautiful image has been deeply imprinted in our hearts. Up until the latest "I am Suzanne," our feelings about her have been very good. Among them, there are also several of her French language films, which also have considerable appeal. She has not been in Hollywood for long, but in the Fox Company, although Janet Gaynor – also a female star whom most Shanghai audiences like to watch – is in fact occupying the Queen's position, she has already become the first red star. Last year, she filmed three films in total, and the business was not bad, but Lilian herself was very dissatisfied with her work. You know, this young lady is outspoken. She thinks what she says; she says what she does. Since she herself is not satisfied with her own work, she is unwilling to continue doing it in a half-hearted manner. She said, "It's either the best, or the worst. It's either a great success, or it's better to leave America forever."</p>
<p>When a reporter went to visit her, she actually started complaining to herself. She said: "I have failed here. I know it myself. According to my contract, I still have to film two more movies after finishing this one, but I feel that (Serenade) is my last movie. If the result is just average, then there is no need to try anymore. I should just go home." Lilian's home is a fashionable villa in the French Riviera. So she is going back to Europe to make movies. She also said, "Audiences spend money to seek entertainment, you cannot force them to accept a star they don't like. I have tried running to the movie theaters myself to take their criticism. I think they are not stupid, they have good judgment, they can appreciate real entertainment. But in Europe, they like me very much!" Indeed, Lilian Harvey is the most popular female star in Europe. Her "Congress Dances" filmed in Berlin was welcomed everywhere, and the Fox Company's invitation for her to come to America was also accompanied by special and extensive publicity.</p>
<p>However, according to Lilian herself, this expanded publicity was her fatal wound. Before Lilian arrived in Hollywood, Fox had already begun to hype her up. People who read the newspapers read about her itinerary every day, as if a foreign queen was coming to visit. When she arrived in Hollywood, forty large trunks of luggage and a cloud of servants followed her, as well as a silver-white "imported" car. The Fox Company also arranged for her a exquisitely decorated residence on the company grounds, and all the furnishings and decorations were carefully selected and expensive to please her. But now Lilian says, "These have all harmed me! I did not demand so many luxurious things. That kind of publicity is not what I like. On the contrary, it has caused a backlash in the minds of the audience. When the public heard so many nice things, they thought a miracle in the world had appeared. When they took a look and there was nothing particularly amazing, they returned disappointed. Otherwise, they could have liked me very much. The publicity was too much!" Lilian is a talented woman who has received higher education, so her words are very thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e298">Review of "The Whirlpool of Life" <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Whirlpool｜｜Grand Theatre</p>
<p>Regardless of the cold reception this film may have received in China, we must admit that it is a better production from Columbia Pictures and a worthwhile work among American films. However, the reason for its unpopularity may be that the name Jack Holt does not resonate deeply with the general Chinese audience.</p>
<p>Speaking of the film itself, although it still contains many flaws, on the whole, it does not disappoint us too much. We believe that when a person tries desperately to rise from adverse circumstances, but society does not allow his aspirations, the fallen can only fall further, and finally end in a tragic death. Therefore, Lincoln's struggles in the whirlpool, his efforts to save himself, his good conscience, his willingness to sacrifice himself for the happiness of his wife and daughter, his tragic suicide, and his painstaking efforts never being understood by his wife even after his death – in these aspects, the playwright evokes great sympathy from the audience, which is undoubtedly a victory.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the playwright firmly grasped human emotions as the main method, and completed a sentimental ethical tragedy. However, precisely because of this, he treats this human tragedy entirely as an idealistic exhortation. Thus, he believes that a fallen person, if he has a conscience, should sacrifice himself to ensure the happiness of his wife and daughter, even to the point of suicide. This does not involve a rigorous analysis and dissection of society, and relying on individual good and evil to address a serious part of social problems naturally offers no way to find a solution. This demand is not excessive for filmmakers, but it is very difficult for most American playwrights.</p>
<p>To reiterate, up to this point, the playwright's and even the director's methods of expression still move us. (1) When Lincoln is sentenced to twenty years in prison, the scene of the couple crying while facing each other across the iron bars reminds us of the moment before Lincoln killed the man, when the couple were playfully and slightly sentimentally toying with their wedding rings, as well as the embrace at the time of the sentencing and the painful separation – that profound emotion can only be achieved by film. (2) In prison, Lincoln sadly begins to endure those long years. But his cellmate desperately tries to escape, only to jump from a high place into the water, and amidst the dense gunfire, we only see countless bubbles and waves emerging from the dark water, and that life ends just like that. (3) Lincoln is released from prison after serving his full term, and the two large iron doors close heavily behind him. He begins to gain freedom, looks up at the blue sky with infinite hope. He spent half his life in prison, and now his hair is gray, and the world has changed a lot. The new-style cars cannot help but arouse his curiosity. (4) He is a kind-hearted man. After protecting his daughter's flesh and blood, he resolves not to rescue his accomplices anymore. But society cannot tolerate him, and when forced to, he has to kill that lawyer. Then he burns his wife's photo, gazing at her face as it is destroyed in the fire. This makes us think of the first time he asked his daughter, "How is your mother? Is she happy?" and accepting the photo of his already wealthy wife joyfully in the bar late at night. Then the daughter and the old friend hear a gunshot, and this man who has been steadfast and unwilling to fall all his life ends here. Here, the director matches both gunshots with close-ups of the daughter and the old friend's faces. Especially the last shot, the degree of emotion we feel seeing the faces of the daughter and the old friend is definitely something that ordinary, vulgar directors cannot achieve. (5) A small death cannot evoke deep sympathy in the human world. In the quiet night, although the radio broadcasts his death as news, it is just a very ordinary thing, and his death cannot break the deathly silence. The wife quietly embroiders flowers next to him, and she never understood his life at all. An ordinary life, an ordinary death, everything passes by ordinarily... We cannot deny that this sentimental atmosphere has indeed victoriously shaken our sorrow.</p>
<p>After seeing "The Fugitive," and then seeing "The Whirlpool of Life," there are many similarities. If we only talk about the method of expression, then the former is very successful in terms of tension and stimulation, while the latter, with many natural and lively jokes, makes the plot not feel dull at all, and the balancing of sadness and joy is Roy William Neill's specialty. If the former makes us excited and sad, and the latter makes us sentimental and melancholic, then it is fully achieved.</p>
<p>The actors, of course, Jack Holt, the protagonist, performs the best, and the rest of the cast are also very suitable for their roles.</p>

<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>Recently, there are two new trends in the American film industry, that is, they will produce a large number of literary films and classical films.</p>
<p>1. Literary Films: MGM will produce Dickens's "David Copperfield." United Artists will produce Tolstoy's "Resurrection," starring Anna Sten and Fredric March, directed probably by Mamoulian. And Dumas's "The Count of Monte Cristo," and Jack London's "The Call of the Wild." Warner Bros. will produce Sinclair Lewis's "Babbitt." And Universal will produce Alan Poe's "The Raven," and so on.</p>
<p>2. Classical Films: Because MGM's "Treasure Island" was very successful, all companies are competing to produce classical films. It is said that Warner Bros. has already begun to produce "Captain Blood." 20th Century Fox has also successfully produced "The Affairs of Cellini," starring Fredric March and Constance Bennett. As for RKO, it will also have Katharine Hepburn star in a film about a queen.</p>

<h3 id="e301">The Struggle to Love and Obtain a Child (Doctor Monica) (11) <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>Anna ran outside and hurriedly made a phone call to Manley in Ironton. She told the maid not to make tea and just give her some water. She drank a sip of water and, with a determined look on her face, went out the gate, jumped into a car, and went straight to Ironton. When she arrived in Ironton, she straightforwardly told Manley about the matter. She told Manley that on the night the child was born, Monica knew that the child was John's, and now Monica was going to leave John forever because of this. At first, when Manley heard that Monica was going to leave John, a look of hope appeared on her face. She thought that after Monica left, John would belong to her alone. Anna saw her face, understood her meaning, and told her, "If John still loves you, then of course it's different, but John doesn't love you anymore. I'm telling you the truth." The radiance on Manley's face immediately dissipated. She hesitated and said, "Oh. That's for the best. Because..." She paused again, because this lie was too far from the truth, making it almost impossible for her to speak, "I don't love him anymore either." Anna knew her thoughts and comforted her with pity, "There are really too many women who are misled by love. Why should you be sad?" Manley said, "I will make everything right tomorrow." The next afternoon, Monica returned home from outside, and the maid hurriedly opened the door, telling her that Miss Manley had sent a child. She told Monica, "The nanny who sent the child said that you understand everything." Monica said, "But I don't understand. Where is Mr. Brandon?" Emma said, "The master hasn't returned yet." Monica sighed, and her heart was much calmer. She walked into her bedroom, looking at the child sleeping in the bed. Monica looked at the child with curious eyes. Emma then sent over a letter, which the nanny had left. Monica opened the letter and read it, her breathing quickened, and her face changed. Emma asked, "Is it important?" Monica revealed a flustered look and said, "It's not important. This child is being fostered here by a friend." Emma said, "Aren't you leaving tonight?" Monica said, "I'm afraid my plan has to change a bit." As she spoke, she lowered her head, brought it close to the child's face, and thought of Manley, grateful to her for arranging everything so well. At this moment, the door outside rang. She knew that John had returned, and she quickly put the child down and ran outside. John walked in and said sadly to Monica, "In a few hours, this place will be different." Monica stammered, "John, I have something to tell you. I... I don't know how you'll deal with it." John looked at her inexplicably, waiting for her to continue, but the phone rang urgently, interrupting Monica's words. The voice on the phone was Anna's. She asked with a crying voice, "Monica, have you seen the newspaper?" Monica said, "No. What's the matter?" Anna said, "Manley took her own plane and flew towards the Atlantic Ocean. She only brought a few hours' worth of gasoline..." Anna's voice choked and she couldn't continue. Monica was stunned. It turned out that she took the plane, not to go home as she said in the letter. She hung up the phone, stood with her back to John, trying to calm herself. John still asked, "Isn't she coming to see you off?" Monica said, "I'm going to see her in a while." John asked again, "What were you going to tell me just now?" Monica took his hand and led him to the bedroom, where he saw a child. He looked at Monica in surprise, speechless for a moment. Monica said, "I want to adopt her, okay?" John said, "Okay? Isn't that what we've been thinking about for a long time?" Monica looked at her, unable to tell whether it was joy or pain. She picked up the child and put her in John's arms, saying, "John, hold her, she's yours." She took a step back, tears streaming down her face. She looked out the window at the darkening sky, silently saying a tragic farewell to Manley. (The End)</p>
