<h3 id="c14">讀日本外務省聲明之憤言 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 貞</p>
<p>本月十七十八兩日。日本外務省發言人。一再發表正式聲明。其所述之要點凡二。（一）日本與外强對付中國之立塲。並不一致。日本將以全力推行其政策。（二）力持東亞門羅主義反對國際援助中國之任何共同行動。設各國爲國際合作襄助中國一事不惜以武力求貫澈。則日本亦必以武力相周旋。該項聲明發表後我國人民固憤懣塡庸羣起抗議。卽世界各國亦莫不受强度之刺激。震驚日本態度之强橫。迨世界輿論之激昻空氣。傳入廣田之耳鼓。乃又望風轉舵。致電各駐外使臣。相機掩飾。狐埋狐搰。固該國當局之所優爲者也。</p>
<p>猜度日本所以突發如此露骨之聲明。自有其理由可言。一則以爲日關係已漸次好轉赫爾與齋藤之交歡巳掃去太平洋上之暗雲。　不妨更進一步。以試探美國委曲求全之忍耐程度。二則蘇日邦交。愈趨惡化。蘇聯究將放棄北滿利益與否。日本殊無把握。不妨一試蘇聯之眞意何在。三則日本已審知國際聯盟缺乏實力以過問遠東事變。而英國外交。則以支撑國聯組織爲根本原則。此點已不相容。且英日間經濟衝突。不易調和。政治關係復太有逆轉可能。藉此一着。直接以反對國聯對於中國之技術合作。間接以偵察英人之本意。四則中國人民忍氣呑聲。爲時已二年有餘。但抗日觀念殊未搖動建設事業。尤有進步。一旦日本與其他國家發生戰爭。中國人民勢必乘機奮起。以圖恢復旣往之損失。故欲以先聲奪人。危詞恫嚇。使中國朝野了然於結納外援之非計。而甘心屈伏於其鐵蹄之下。</p>
<p>是以日本斯舉之動機。可以『試探空氣』四字盡之。至於美英兩國對於日本此種帶有威脅性質之聲明。於表示驚異之外。殆各抱有不同之態度。美國於海外市塲之開發。最大希望厥在中國。故盡力撑持門户開放與機會均等之說。日本獨占政策自所反對。不過現時正苦於國内之經濟恐慌雅不欲棌取實際行動。是則在其表示不安與震驚之餘。充量亦不過寄我國以若干同情而已。英國態度仍似沉着。惟應變之凖備。則未嘗稍怠。恐英日間對立之激化。或較美日爲甚。未可知也。</p>
<p>我國外交當局。處此種國際情勢之下。瞻前顧後。應具如何之决心與果斷乎。而觀夫外交部人員之聲明。似尚未能明白折顯示我國民本意之所在。吾人今敢正告日當局曰。中日親交所應採取之正確途徑。維持東亞和平所應遵循之基本要件。悉爲日本旣往及現時之武力侵略政策所摧毁。若必欲貫澈今茲之荒謬聲明。祇有加速禍變。招致未來之戰爭。我中國外交折衝之通融讓步。必有一定之界限。過此界限。必當出全力以爭。縱至犧牲一切。亦所不辭。目前我國實力。誠甚薄弱。但民族意識則日益滋長。兩國人民之惡感醖釀愈久。則爆發也愈烈。同時又欲爲我國民告者。日人之野心。决無饜足之時。吾人當再接再厲奮發自身蕴藏之力。必國民有力。而後可政府不屈服的外交之後盾。擁有數千年光榮歷史之中華民族。誠欲不盡亡於吾人之手。其亟本自强不息之精神。急圖實力自救之凖備。</p>

<p>趨訪綏省建設廳廳長馮曦氏、承談綏省建設事業、甚爲重要、紀述如次、</p>

<p>據沈君談、國人之所謂『南洋、』乃係指暹羅、（獨立國）安南、（法屬）缅甸、（英屬）婆羅洲、（英荷分領）海峽殖民地、（英屬）馬來亞、（英屬）東印度、（荷屬）及菲律賓（美屬）之總稱、其中大部皆爲島嶼、故又稱『南洋羣島、』華僑之寄居於此者、約六百五十餘萬人、移殖歷史、遠在宋明以前、有史册可考者約七百餘年、南洋羣島因位居熱帶、氣候終年如夏、土地肥沃、出産極爲豐富、其最著者、如暹羅之米·爪哇之糖·馬來亞之樹膠及黃梨·（波羅蜜）椰之·碩莪粉·薯粉·玉蜀黍·烟葉·香蕉·咖啡·及各種果品、礦産之最著者、爲馬來半島之鍚與鐵·及荷印之石油·南洋羣島土人、大部皆爲馬來人種、皮膚棕色、篤信回敎、智識極低、且性情怠惰、不善積蓄、在十年前土産價格高漲時、華人之至此者、鮮不立成鉅富、蓋華人勤儉耐勞、且智識高出土人遠甚、當時之南洋、確可稱爲『黃金滿地、』閩粤人土、稍集旅費、至南洋後、身無分文、先爲人作苦力、得資後、改作小販商人、由小販商人不數年、卽一躍而爲鉅贾、故今日南洋之大腹賈、大半皆出身微賤、甚且有目不識丁者、</p>

<p>要求條件工會根據全體工人决議、向黨政機關提出要求條件门項、（一）撤職查辦警察第三中隊裴隊長、（二）擔保受傷者生命、（成殘廢或不幸死亡）須負完全之責、（三）負責一切醫藥費及損失、（四）切實保障以後不發生同様事情、（五）查辦兇手、（六）以上各項、限於五天内答復、</p>

<h3 id="c210">讀『啼笑因緣』 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>我是一個愛看小說的靑年，而且因爲自己的程度低，看的又大半是舊小說。</p>
<p>讀了你們的『讀書問答』後，才知道我所看的書完全是有害而無益的了，我眞慚愧！如果我自己問一問自己；你爲什麽看小說？從小說内學到了些什麽？我是無話可答的。</p>
<p>我現在决計照着你們所指示的路走，多看些於自己的實際生活有關係的新東西。舊小說是娛樂人的，是引人想入非非的，新小說是剌激人的，是導人深入社會的，這道理的大槪，我現在也明白了。</p>
<p>但是，留在我腦内還成疑問的，是『爲什麽這些害人的舊小說還可以風行一時，爲什麽偏有許多人會入他他迷途呢？譬如『啼笑因緣，』在目前出版界，依然是一部銷行最廣的小說；難道是因爲它的内容豐富？（當然不是的）或者是因爲它的技巧神好？（也不見得。）照你們的看法、世界上的事，卽使這様的小事，總也不該有所謂偶然的吧。</p>
<p>對於『啼笑因緣』以及這類似的讀物，我希望你們能够給于一個正確的批判。這，比你們以前那様提出一般的意見，是更能使讀者得到益處的。</p>
<p>你所提出的問题，正是我們向讀者所要求的問題。由一般讀書方法的討論，進而至于某一本書，某一問題的具體的探討，這原是我們工作上一定的程序，而且我們已在這様做了，　　現在根據你的意見，來對：啼笑因緣作一番考察，</p>
<p>第一，『啼笑因緣』爲什麽會這様風行一時呢？這問題，决不是如一般庸俗者們以爲是『技巧純熟，』或者『偶然的幸運』那様槪念地可以說明的，我們必須從所由産生的社會去尋出根源，就是說，它的社會根據在那裏？它是怎様迎合一般讀者的脾胃？</p>
<p>啼笑因緣，無疑的是最能把中國複雜的社會綜錯的表現出來的一部著作。（我們不能因爲它的内容，而抹殺這一點）中國社會的發展是極其畸形的，在上海，我們就可以看到高入雲霄的三大公司，與古色古香的紅廟爲隣，看到風馳電閃的電車汽車與獨輪手推車同路。由這而反映到人們思想上，于是就成爲：提倡科學救國者，同時又在那裏提倡唸經救國，太極拳救國，出入歐台舞榭者，同時又在那裏朝山拜佛，頂禮求神，這種出現在同一時間的相隔懸殊的生活様式，便是啼笑因緣的社會基礎。</p>

<p>中院昨日表演、甚有不少精彩之處、其純熟之聯絡、凖確之投籃、遠非交大所及、不愧爲北平之冠軍、前鋒後衛、五人極爲平均之至、上塲之初、交大包新第周怒安之二中、使交大以四對零佔先、然中院不慌不忙、張育才之一罰一中、趙振績加上二分、中院遂以五比四超出、從此中院漸漸得手、發展順利、不稍受挫、而以十七比六超出十一分之鉅、交大努力追隨、一度曾趕成十九比十四、及上半時終、比數爲二十六比十五、</p>
<h3 id="c218">一路順風 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>上半時起、交大陣綫、雖加以變更、然卒因中院之鋒芒銳利、竟陷入於慌亂之情狀中、射籃尤屢失不中、在中院趙振績因三次犯規關係、不無拘束、然因此更小心作戰、其數次凖確之遠射、甚受稱許、段焯亦精彩疊出、於是分數遂連續增加一路順風、毫無阻碍、三十四比十六、四十比二十、、已相差及半、此時中院後衛王堪若四次犯規出、然已無影響於大局、結果成四十六比二十四、</p>

<p>— 一讀者</p>
<p>這一屆的遠東運動大會、因爲僞國的參加問題、幾至流産、幸賴吾國代表的力爭、輿論界的援助、以及菲代表的主持公道、總算殺退了日本的野心使遠運會仍得如期舉行、這是我們非常欣幸的、但是在預選的過程中、却發現了幾件十分掃興的事情、其中最堪痛心的、便是足球健將孫锦順、戴麟經、馮運佑等四人、和網球大將林寳華的不出席、</p>
<p>據說孫錦順的不出席、乃是受了他的愛妻和愛子臥病的影響、這種情形、情猶可願、但希望出發前、孫君妻子病愈了、體恊會不要拘泥章程、仍舊選拔他、</p>
<p>至於戴麟經呢、大家早已公認他爲中國最佳之中鋒人才、此次華隊代表的中鋒一職、自必非他莫屬、不料他却輕輕以國貨銀行要搬塲的一句話、來做推托、留滬不行、這種舉動、我們認爲是缺乏了國家思想的表現、不勝替戴君的光榮的名譽可惜、</p>
<p>林君寳華的不出席、那是更不成話了、竟說是不忍與愛妻久别、故把爲國爭光的大事業也丢掉了、這是絕對錯誤的行爲、輿論界應一致起來督促他、鼓勵他、</p>
<p>總之、我們要知道中國人和日本人同様是黃色人種、體力智慧十九相等、而現在日本之所以强、中國之所以弱者、其唯一原因、就爲日本人的國家思想深、中國的的國家思想淡、日本人肯爲國家犧牲、中國人只肯爲金錢女人犧牲、這一個弱點我們將如何糾正他、　　然而最後我們也應該爲運動員本身設想、生活與運動、是有連鎖性的關係、在生活安定的條件下、才能充份發展其天才去運動、爲國家爭光、有不少的運動員、因爲得不到生活的安定、沒有相當的援助、而不得不放葉他爲國爭光的雄心、那又何等的可惜、當然、有不少的人、是熱心於此、也不應一筆抹煞但是我們體育的當局、一般的社會又何嘗注意到此點、何怪乎運動員的民氣、要銷沉得等於零了、畸形的社會、不禁嘆息</p>

<p>— 一知</p>
<p>目下具高級選擇性的超外差式收音機日趨發展、甚需要一種調整指示器、由肉眼視察，以調整收音機訊號至最尖銳靈敏點、經英人探討研究、得一種陰極綫調整管、名曰調整顯影管、（ＪｕｎｏｇｒａＰｈ）此管外形見圖一，形如普通式眞空管，管内有絲極，有屏極，有火螢石光幕（ＦｌｕｏｒｓｃｅｎｔＳｃｒｅｅｎ及偏倚板一對、使）</p>
<p>用時、燈絲接四弗打電壓、收音機司工作</p>

<p>後、在此玻璃管内螢石光幕上發出螢石光點及螢石光短綫，藉此六調整訊號至最佳點。</p>
<p>此器實爲最小陰極綫振盪顯影管（ＣａｔｈｏｄｅＲａｙＯｓｃｉｌｌｏｇｒａｐｈ）接於超外差式收音機最後一級中間週率（ＩｎtermediateFrequen5y）上使用···接法有二種[&gt;I</p>

<p>，見圖二（甲）（乙）在（甲）圖上需一耗阻器，R其阻力爲一萬或二萬歐姆、此耗阻器R與最後中間週率管串連。因此，在螢石光幕上卽發見一綠光小點，狀似螢光，此光點當在未調整訊號之前，偏向左方，待調整訊號後，卽移向右方；訊號愈强，則更偏向右。</p>
<p>圖二（乙）爲使用該管的另一接法，此調整顯影管接在收音機的最後調整級，乃在螢石光幕上發見一條如串連的短劃綠色光綫，此綫劃愈長、則訊號亦愈强。</p>
<p>此簡單陰極綫振盪顯影管除作此調整指示器之外，尚有其他用途，茲不具述。</p>

<p>今日無線電播送，當以短波最受推崇，蓋短波能以較小之電力而達極遠之距離，且無線電通訊所最討厭而又最難避免之天電，亦較少干擾；反而言之，在收受方面，如欲聆歐美之播音，亦非短波所不可能。</p>
<p>今國内備有短波收音機者爲數巳衆，但短波通訊之變幻與奥妙，非長波（廣播波域）所可比擬，如收音於短波毫無常識，未有不陷於失望者也。</p>
<p>所謂短波，係指波長較普通廣播波域爲短者言，卽指在二百米突以下的約至十五米突之波長。</p>
<p>短波收音機，普通均備有三四個以上之線圈，以供收受波長長短不同之波帶，但此各種不同之波長，因受各種原因影響，以致有利於日間受收，有非至夜間而不能受收者。</p>
<p>晝與夜的差别</p>
<p>收受在二十五米突波長以下之電訊，普通以白天較夜間爲佳。但在五十米突以上之波長則反之。凡在二十米突以下之波長，由實騐所得，從播送電台以至收受機之中間路程須全部在日光之下纔能收聽。在二十米突至三十五米突之間，最佳以播送機或收音機二者之一在黑夜之中。</p>
<p>天波與地波</p>
<p>收音機接收無綫電。有天波與地波之别。由地波接收音非常可靠，但能够收受之路程則較短；由天波接收者則可收受甚遠之距離，但須受季節氣候之影響與晝夜之變遷，且又能發生廣大之越程（ＳｋｉｐＤｉｓｔａｎｃｅｓ）使在此區域中之人無法收聽。</p>
<p>越程之意義係指一帶地波所不能及與天波所未及的區域，在此區域中接收便不能獲良好之成績，或甚至一無所聞。越程無固定性，自晝徂夜時時變遷，是以短波收音，有時佳，有時劣者，此亦一主要原因也。</p>
<p>籍地波接收，如中間無鋼骨建築隔離及局部干擾過分厲害等情形，其成績應永遠佳好。地波接收之可靠距離，大約波長在一百米突者爲九十英里，在十五米突者，則僅十五英里。接收短波電訊普通大都由天波收得，由地波者極少。天波接收之可靠路程，須依季節與晝夜而轉移，波長在一百米突者，大約在九十英里至二千五百英里之間；在二十五米突者，從三百英里起以至無限遠：在十五米突者，正午時約在七百至四千英里。中夜時接收十五米突以下之波長，僅可在地波所達之範圍内接收。波長在七·五米突以下者·便無所謂天波，其播送原理，則近於光波發射矣。</p>
<p>天波之可靠射程，其變遷在季節之間甚慢，但在晝夜之間則極速。越程在日中時最微；在午夜時最大。收音者在日出與日落變遷最大之時，最易遇罕見之情形。波長愈短，則越程愈大。此外如天電，太陽黑點，及磁暴等原因，均能影響收受之距離。（待續）</p>

<p>汽車收音機在我國尚少普及，雖滬地有出售者，但價格之昂貴非一般人所能購置，就是汽車中裝置亦很稀見，其特點就是電源均由六弗打之蓄電池供給，乙電壓亦由六弗打蓄電池之電源昇高按蓄電池之電源，係屬直流，直流電壓祇可降低而不能昇高，欲使昇高除非以直流先變成交流。（如附圖）故該機中就添了一部直流變交流的振動機械，使平穩了直流電源變成一種顫動交流，然後接到昇高變壓器的初級上，然後再經過一番整流與濾波之手續，使再變爲平穩之高壓電流（卽乙電）至於該機中之振動機械，亦可照本刋四十二期（直流電怎様用變壓器一文）設計之，其他部份皆大同小異，天線可用一塊四十八英时又三十六英时之紫銅絲布夾於汽車之蓬頂中，地線均可接於蓄電池之負極上，該機用三九商週率放大，用三六作檢波，用三八作强力低放，八中作全波整流，昇高變器（Ｔ）之製法較普通變壓器稍異，繞線圈所用之綫須用雙紗包，（弗用漆包綫）每層須用較厚子絕緣物隔開，勿鬆動，因振動機械振動時綫圈内要發生磁感，倘内線圈稍振動，則就會促短它的壽命，該變壓器初級爲五弗打，次級高壓兩頭均爲一百六十弗打，整流濾波後尚餘一百三十餘弗打以供放大之需也。眞空管之絲極均直接蓄電池上。Ｌ用三十號漆包線在一又二分之一徑的膠管上繞三十圈，距離Ｌ四分之一吋繞九十圈爲Ｌ１Ｌ２與Ｌ，同，Ｌ３與Ｌ１同，Ｃ１Ｃ２爲·○○○三五ＭＦ固定電容器，Ｃ４爲·五ＭＦ固定電容器，C5爲·○○○一ＭＦ固定電容器，C6爲·○二MF固定電容器C7爲，四MF固定電容器，C8C9C10C11均爲四MF固定電容器，R1爲一百五十歐姆固定耗阻器，R2爲二十萬歐姆可變耗阻器連開關（S），以啓關絲極與振動機械之電源，R3爲五萬歐姆固定耗阻器，R4爲五萬五千歐姆固定耗阻器，R6爲一千六百歐姆固定耗阻器，AFC自感量均爲三十亭利，能通過電流三十份安培，附圖方格之虚線係全局隔離罩，以免除雜聲者：</p>
<h3 id="c263">電波晝弱夜强之理由 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— 博淸</p>
<p>我們來談談在遠距離收音，爲什麽夜間的收音强度會比日間的收音强度來得强，理由是極簡單的。</p>
<p>因爲由發射用天綫放射出來的電波，約可分爲兩種：一種是沿着地球表面傳播而來的，呌做表面波；另一種是向上空進行而至的，呌做空間波。</p>
<p>表面波旣由地球表面傳播而來，當然要起急激的减衰現象，所以欲其傳至遠距離，殊爲困難。</p>
<p>至於空間波是由空間進行的，所以會受空間狀態的影響，也是必然的現象。</p>
<p>地球的上空，槪因高度增高，而空氣亦漸次稀薄。所以存在上層的自然是各種稀薄的氣體。這些氣體，因受太陽光綫的作用，槪成電離狀態，而被想像爲造成一種層形，就是所謂海氏層（ＨａｖｉｓｄｅｓＬａｙｅｒ）。</p>
<p>日間因有强烈的太陽光綫的緣故，此層比較的存在於地球表面的附近，空間波遇之當然會消失其大部分的勢力。然在夜間，乃因電離層，遙向上方移動，所以空間波，由此欲達到上方之間，必會發生反射及屈折等作用，而其大部分，勢必重行達到距離地球表面上較遠的地方。</p>
<p>接收無綫電時，日間只接收表面波，所以遠距離的收音，自然甚爲微弱，惟一到夜間，卽如上述的理由，空間波旣由上空而至，因之收音强度自然就會增大起來。</p>

<p>收音機中之電容器，雖有時可以省去不裝，但究以照裝之效果爲佳。在短波機中固定電容器尤屬重要。今將短波收音機中應裝固定電容器之處，該電容器之容量，及裝後之劾果等，述之如下：</p>
<p>（一）在第一只音週率變壓器次級，跨接一只○○○五兆分法拉特之固定電容器，可使音調圓潤。</p>
<p>（二）在第一只音逾率變壓器之初級，跨接一只○○二至○○一兆分法拉特之電容器，可增强再生式短波收音機之再生力。</p>
<p>（三）在乙電池正員極間，加接一只一减法拉特之固定電容器，可以增加收程及音量。（如檢波級及成音週率放大級所用之乙電壓不同，則宜各接一只一兆分法拉特之固定電容器。）</p>
<p>（四）收音機之輸出處加接一只○○○五至○○一兆分法拉特之固定電各容器，可以改少雜聲。</p>
<p>（五）如用活動阻耗器調節再生力，則如在射電週率阻流圈之（Ｒ、Ｆ、Ｃ、）接至再力圈之一端與乙電負極間，接一只○○五兆分法拉特之固定電容器，可减少雜音，並增加靈敏度。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>讀者試想：一個面目黎黑，整天伴着烟和煤在一起的火夫，戴起了這様一頂小洋傘式的朝帽，可不活像一去支老菌嗎？再把他足下所穿的一對黑緞製的長靴，身上所穿的一襲顔色鮮艷得像彩虹一般的錦袍，和他所站的那個煤堆比較一下，你們就不難想見那是成了一種怎様的現象！但是這種現象畢竟是實現了，本來，皇太后的命令，便等於法律，誰還能更改！</p>
<p>在一輛機關車裏，同時有三個司機在服役。當然他們也都打扮得和太監一様待我們用甲司機，乙司機，丙司機來分别他們，其時，他們的地位已和朝中的大臣，各省的總督，一様的重要了：所以他們儘可盡量的要求多派幾個助手，然而正氏在那裏開車的，却祗是甲司機一個人。（事實上也不容許兩個人同時開車）在平常的日子，他總有一個坐位，可以安安穩穩地坐着；但是在這一列御用火車上，除了皇太后自己以外，無論什麽人却是不准坐的，於是他也只得直挺挺地站着。那乙司機的職務是很省力的，他只須望前面看着，如果發現軌道上有發現什麽變故，丨丨譬如像一頭牛在軌道上穿過，或其他相類的事情。丨丨就由他負責報告甲司機。這個人的位置，在尋常的列車上是没有的；就是偶而有，也可以很隨便地拉一張凳子，在甲司機旁邊坐下的；但有這一次，他當然也不能再坐了，因此他往往把蹲和跪的兩個動作，互相輪替了運用着，稍資休息。這便是皇太后所最注意的禮節和權威。（一六）</p>

<p>在中國，除了古物的生産，因爲上海沒有古墓，其餘，可說不拘怎麽一回子事，上海，都比了任何一處來得發達。</p>
<p>從積極方面說罷，十八層，二十四層的大厦，比了名山古刹裏的浮屠古塔，又得高上不少。說道馬路，在汽車裏，儘着四個輪盤在馬路上滾，儘能滾上十里八里，而能使車裏的一杯水，一些兒不潑出來。這比了别處的汽車，可使人的屁股，與座位脫離關係的，自有上下床之别。就是平坦的，也大都是像某處的所謂『一衝頭』，究也是小巫之見大巫。衣着方面，綾羅綢緞，呢絨嗶嘰，也比了别處的多而且好。卽以廠布而論。每年由上海，輸入内地的，更不知若干。吃，更是集東西中外，京粤蘇揚的大成，可說是有菜皆備，無味不臻。最後，輪到文化。大學，有官立，有私立，更有野雞的。中學，更其是五花八門。小學，簡直是不勝枚舉。每一個弄裏，平均至少有一個小學校，雖然有的是設在灶披間裏的。</p>
<p>消極方面說呢，烟館，賭窟，娼寮，强盜，騙子，拐匪，甚麽都比任何一處發達。此外如一切離離奇的事情，如自殺啦，傷害風化的事情啦，推銷洋貨的方法啦，也是别處所望塵莫及的。</p>

<p>髮辫，在現代的都市小姐們中，好算已經被『摩登』二字，所排擠而落伍了。其實，髮辫這東西。從形式上看來，垂垂如豚尾，也沒有什麽美觀。從實際上講來，牽絲攀藤，做事又諸多不便。實在還是爽爽快快，付之并州一剪的好。尤其是，一部份出身貧家而作工的女子，更不可不把這害人的東西除去。要知這髮辫，是你的仇敵。有時，竟會把你置之死地。但是伊們知識淺陋，大都抱着舊觀念。保持着這煩惱絲，不肯剪去。眞是可憐可嘆！</p>
<p>在不久以前，本報本市新聞欄内，曾有這様一叚的記載：『本埠×××日華第二紗廠有女工揚州人×××年十五歲，昨夜正在工作之時。詎偶一不愼，其髮辫忽爲機器皮帶纏住，立時將身懸空吊起，致髮辫及頭皮完全捲去。血肉淋漓，慘不忍覩，旋不及救治而死。···』　　像以上機器殺人的慘劇，報紙上時常可以瞧到。但社會人士，好似沒有注意。覺得『人命如蟻』這句話，並非是過激之談了。在下觸目傷懷，所以寫了這篇警告的文字。再提出個辦法來，希望市當局嚴重取締。知照本市各大小工廠，凡蓄有髮辫之女工，一律須將髮辫剪去。在工廠一方面，也要定出一條章程。女工須剪去髮辫，否則停止工作。這様一來，若輩爲飯碗起見，自然相率剪辫。那末可以免除危險，保全多少苦兒弱女的生命　　大命，功德無量。還望各工廠主持者，督促實行纔好！</p>

<p>他原來的意思，不過這様想着，桂枝已嫁給趙自强了，却不知道最近生活怎様，所以非要探望探望不可！及至見過了桂枝，却不由自己生着無窮的感慨，這感慨在那一點，也說不上，只覺行人生的幸福，完全是以金錢爲憑據，人沒有錢，就什麽也不必談。假如自己在一年以前，已經將生活問題解决了，那末，今年過陰歷年，必定有個家庭，而且就是一位健而美的女子來佈置這個家庭的了。他在路上徘徊着，什麽都不感到，直到臉上手上，都覺得冰透了骨了，一輪金黃色，帶着病態的太陽，已經沉到西山頂上去了，這才回家去。所幸思想越舊的人家，過年的空氣也越濃厚，積之回家以後，許多過年的事，將他籠罩着，也就把别的事情丢到一邊去了。晚上吃過了年飯，哥嫂帶着孩子們擲升官圖，開話匣子帶守歲。積之陪着鬧了兩個鐘頭，退回小書房裏來，在燈下習字消遣。因爲一個人在屋子裏很沉靜的，對過趙家拉扯空竹的聲音，却聽得很淸楚。由這一點上，便想到趙家全是大人，並沒有小孩子，却不知道這空竹是誰人扯的？除非桂枝這位老姑娘，有時還衐着童氣。那麽，這空竹必是這新少奶奶玩的了。這様看起來，他的生活很優美，他爲人也很快活，和我打比，恰是相處在反面，以前我相信看他，以及所作的那番甜美之夢，於今看起來，完全是錯誤了。他如此想時，覺得很煩悶，於是走到廚房裏去，把一隻銅火火鍋子拿來，自已添上炭火，燒開半鍋水，然後將年飯中吃剩下來的　　　　　　　　　不分　　，全向鍋裏加下去。（三六七）</p>

<p>洮石的質相洮河爲陜西臨洮府黃河之支流，洮綠石卽産於此大河深水之中，發現採掘，始自何年，已莫可稽攷，後人所見洮石，大都爲宋代以前之物。因宋時河床，卽已變更，從前採掘之處，石脈己不復可攷，故世上所傳的洮河硯，實已寥寥無幾。其石色以於碧綠上現藍色者爲最貴，次爲綠色中雜黃色或黃色斑點，而其尤爲顯然與他種綠石特别相異之處，卽爲洮綠石，必在如端石蕉葉白之筋紋，與帶露蕉葉初放之狀，初無稍異。凡有筋紋者必有鋒鋩、頗爲銳利，故其發墨與他硯不同，黃山谷贈張文潛詩云··『贈君洮綠含風漪，能淬筆鋒利如錐』，張和山谷詩云··『明窗試墨吐秀潤，端溪歙州無此色。晁無咎和山谷詩云··一洮州石貴雙趙璧，漢水鴨頭無此色。又楊信相詩云··『但見臨州琢蛾綠，焉用歙溪眉子爲』。凡此種種，皆足爲前人寳愛洮石之證也。</p>

<p>看完電影，你如果要買一盒圖釘，或是一束信箋，走到一五一公司，你便會見到一個專賣花仔的一角，那兒擺着各式各様的花仔，紙袋上印着各種花卉盛開時的様式，旁邊擺着花盆，花鋤，泥土，（泥土也要錢賣，你也許會不相信，但這是紐約。）有許多身軀肥胖的老太婆，圍着一個身穿『春之神』的仙裝的女店員，問各種花仔的栽培方法。如果你走到大一點的百貨公司如Ｍａｃｙｓ，在第五層樓上，你還可見到GardenShow，他們特爲你陳列了一個花園的小景，許多從『暖房』裏搬出來的花仔正發着芽，一股春天的濕泥土氣息，冲入你的鼻子裏，那無異對你說：『春已到了人間了。』　　你如果不看電影，幸或者不幸又有了太太，百貨公司用不着你去跑，至少你得看報，報上也會露出春的消息的。體育欄裏有人報告Ｇｉａｕｌｓ或者Ｙａｕｋｅｅ棒球隊開始在某某地方練習，或棒球大王ＲａｂｙＲｕｌｈ執着球棒的玉照，那便是說春天來了，因爲春季是他們練習有時期。馬戲團出發的消息，也是春要到了的象徵；但頂凖確的，要推那讀者來函欄。你如果發現有人從離紐約百餘里地一個小鄕村來信，說昨早聽兄了本年第一個知更雀（Ｒｏｂｉｎ）的鳴聲，那無疑地是春天來了。你也許會疑心這小鄕村的讀者想在大報上出風頭，根本他便沒有聽見知更雀的啼聲，或者宿酒未醒，把貓號當做鳥呌，但編者肯把這信發表，這是春天到了的明證。</p>
<p>有時，你不幸，在下市（ＤｏｗｎＴｏｗｎ）逗留得太久了，到午後五時左右方坐地道車回來，車中擠滿了剛出公事房的男女職員，在那正透不過氣的當兒，對面有一個女人，用整天打字的玉手高攀着車中的皮帶，腋下夾着一個手提包，那疲勞過度的面容中，急然露出半絲笑容來，這笑容雖然不久就消減了，不知牠的來踪，也不知牠的去跡，但這是春天到了的明證，和春水池塘中忽然浮起的一個漩渦一様，同是春神的惡作劇。</p>
<p>女人是春神最行意的傳播者，你看見她們穿上頂新式的衣服，走着頂輕巧的步伍，口中嘘着頂流行的調子，眼角裏的風情向各處放送，那是說：春快熟透了。有愛人的快去找愛人，沒有愛人的，不妨獨自去中央公園跑跑，在那兒，成雙的男女到處都是，春意泛滿了池塘，爛熟在樹上。你如果有熟人在市政府作事，恰巧他又是管理發結婚證書的，這時不妨打一個電話給他試試看，他准會回答你說：『太忙，沒有，工夫答話。』</p>
<p>誰說紐約沒有春天？！</p>
<h3 id="c302">談『小品文』和『幽默』 <a href="#c302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— 由</p>
<p>不知爲什麽小品文會給人家詬病起來、好象是一種罪惡。但提倡文學者又專注重小品，以爲『十四年來中國文學唯一的成功。』何必這麽大驚小怪呢？小品文文，不過小品文而巳。</p>
<p>無疑，『小品文』有時也是『大文學』，（『大文學者，偉大之文學作品也！自註。）大文章的力量，有時遠不及小品文；是値行提倡的！（林先生聞此，當贈不佞以銀烟匣矣·）何况，激動大風波者，往往是冷冷的幾句短言，擾動社會的，時常是潛伏的思想。</p>
<p>攻擊小品者，也許不曾知道個吧：話有種說法，因環境而不同，在『沙攏』中以不喊口號爲佳，寫愛情信最好不抄社會學講義。文章也有種種人物來寫，現出各項各様的角色；卽算同道，有時彼此也不相容。一定要人人都照唯物史觀造文學，或個個人下筆便是　，高爾基，究竟也甚寂寞的。</p>
<p>所以林先生『幽默』之餘，弄弄小品文，大體上也不算什麽，大槪决不致强迫當今文豪，每人寫『小品』一篇，說『幽默』故事一則。譬如林先生吸雪茄（大概也并不甚吸雪茄）靑年聽了便投袂而起，急急奔赴烟公司，豈非太老實了也？</p>
<p>當然，謂現在是『小品文時代』，亦無不可，反正沒有什麽大時代在那里。今兹倒適宜於小品文的滋長；冬雪初消，燒痕微綠，寥寥幾點小花草，點染無限風光。雖然預示未來，目前大概只能如此而已。</p>
<p>主觀言之，則對於偉大的文學，有些像『童蒙拾其香草』了。然『人間世』倒是集全國文學者之大成，上自『蔡先生』，下至全增嘏，人物總算齊全了　，然而弄出這麽一種『人間世』！有些『幽默』不得。也許『其始作也簡，其將畢也鉅』，將來要不同些的，『一宅而寓於不得己，則幾矣』！</p>

<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>電話機在我的寫字台上響了起來。</p>
<p>是眉君嗎·····五點鐘後請你到我家來，他要見見你哩·····有事？請不到吧·····一定來，一定來！（笑聲）』</p>
<p>望望壁上的時計已是四句半了。我隨把寫字台上的文件整理好了。抽着捲烟，忖着這去不去的問題。她結婚了快滿一個月，這一個月中音訊杳然，似乎早已忘了我們從前的密約，然而抛去了一件心上牽掛着的事也是好的。但是今天的電話，好像她經過愼密的計劃，或者她在這一個月中被這事苦痛多時了。這様想着時，就决定去跑一次，無論如何對於我不是損失　　從電車上下來，尋到了　她告訴過我的住址。那是一所里内的小洋房，我上前按了電鈴，開門的是一個小大姐。我告訴她訪×××先生。</p>
<p>『樓上請罷，仍奶等候多時了。』小大姐機械的回答。</p>
<p>不容我考量，雲的笑聲早從樓梯上送來。　　『眉君，樓上來罷。』一個月的新婚生活已完全改變了她的態度。</p>
<p>她穿着一襲絲織的睡衣，好像午睡方醒。在樓梯口和我握了乎，引我到她的房裏去。</p>
<p>『他沒有回來嗎？』我接了她授給我的紙烟問　　『一會就回來的。』好笑着轉向後房去。</p>
<p>我打量了一下房中的佈置，　到沿窗口的沙發上。</p>
<p>『多時不見了。』她從後房出來，換了一襲大紅的旗衫在她結婚前我說過這是件剪裁得最合體的衣服，現在看來，似乎較覺狹窄她見我紙烟沒有着火，忙燃了火柴給我。</p>
<p>『謝謝，眞多時不見了。』</p>
<p>『還在那公司嗎嗎』她退到寫字椅上問。</p>
<p>『是的。』我說了後，想起她電話不是打到我公司來的嗎，或者是她隨意的問着，我就拿起一本寫字台上的××攝影集來亂翻。要末頁我翻着一幀題名『老者』的攝影，一個老人槌着鐵塊，我好像在什麽地方瞧見過，但是記不起來，仰起頭來略一沉吟。</p>
<p>『人生中有這麽一幕。』她像猜到了我的意思　　『是的，你看過人生？』</p>
<p>『金城開幕第一天就去的，做得很好。』</p>
<p>『噢，你告訴我的，那天你妹妹不是遺失一隻乎提　嗎？』</p>
<p>『那你爲什麽問起我來！』她笑着帛抽過一枝捲烟來吸。</p>
<p>『一時忘了。』</p>
<p>小大姐送一杯茶進來，重退了出去，那様機械地。</p>
<p>『爲什麽僱用這様一個僕人？』</p>
<p>『　一點好！』她得意地笑了。</p>
<p>床前的小時計打了六下。</p>
<p>『他還沒有回來？』</p>
<p>『一會就來的。』</p>
<p>『每天這様？』</p>
<p>哈哈，她莫明其妙地高聲大笑：爲什麽要他回來？今天有人請吃夜飯，鬼會回來哩。她返過頭去望了一下閉着的房門說：</p>
<p>『好大的架子，不請不到這裏來！』她從椅中跳起來坐到寫字台上。</p>
<p>『來幹什麽？』</p>
<p>『今天呢？』</p>
<p>我沒有回答，我說些什麽話好呢？我不信一個女子出嫁後變得那様大胆。我注視到乎中的攝影集，彷彿那老者提起鐵槌來在恨恨的打下去，而且似乎他打在我身體的某一部分上。</p>
<p>『怎不開口？問你呢，今天來幹什麽？『她兩條腿架到我的身上來，這舉動是我們認識許多年來從沒有過的。</p>
<p>『我有事，我想走了。』我裝做坦然的站起身來。</p>
<p>『不能吃了夜飯去嗎？』她也似乎正經的說着　　『下次叨擾罷。』</p>
<p>『多客氣！』</p>
<p>『伸過手來，我握了一下，急忙下樓，幾乎帶走了那本攝影集。</p>
<p>『眉君，我不送了，』</p>
<p>我望見她在樓梯口送了個飛吻，眉目間有點悵然的様子。</p>

<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>『你們愛媽媽嗎？···』</p>
<p>『哥哥說媽媽會做外國點心的，麗姑，你吃過嗎？』女孩五還指着那張照片，兩頰紅红的含着笑。</p>
<p>那愛嬌的模様，做父親的人覺得她往常格外的可愛，便把她抱了起來，在她額上輕輕地吻了一吻。</p>
<p>『爸，你剛才說過的，到那裏去呢？』她拍着父親的脖子。</p>
<p>『啊，你在這些事情上最不肯忘記了！』父親把她抱得緊了一點。　　四個人，一起往公園去了。在回家的時候，他們送客人上了車，各人凖了父親的一隻手，眞是難得有的高興着呢，父親也十分高興。</p>
<p>『爸，麗姑是你的什麽人呢？』大的孩子問了。</p>
<p>父親向兩個孩子看了　看，才慢慢地說：</p>
<p>『你們喜歡她嗎？』</p>
<p>『我喜歡的，爸爸。』女孩子說。</p>
<p>『我告訴你們，她就會做你們的媽媽了···』父親遲疑一會，終於帶着不很自然的聲音，這様說了。</p>
<p>『媽媽？』大孩子驚奇地問，他看着父親的臉。</p>
<p>這時，父親正也看着孩子的臉，那孩子驚奇，使他有點不安起來了。</p>
<p>『是啦，你們沒有了媽媽，不是常常覺得不快活嗎？麗姑做了你們的媽媽，她一定很愛你們的。』</p>
<p>孩子都不說話了，女孩子只覺得這實在是新鮮的事情，她還記得麗姑給她一盒巧格力時的微笑，她也記得麗姑慈愛地撫摩過她的頭和小手。那大的孩子，雖然也看見了麗姑的親熱，但一想到一個生疏的人說是來做他的媽媽，小小的心靈上，總覺得有點不自然了：而且一說到麗姑會做他的媽媽，他不能不想到自己的媽媽了媽媽的容貌和愛撫他還記行很淸楚的，想到這一切，便看了看身邊的父親親，低下頭不作一聲。</p>
<h3 id="c306">西游日錄（八） <a href="#c306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>其他的一支岩鼻，就是有一個四面佛亭造在那裏的一條絕壁，比倒掛蓮花位置稍東一點，與倒掛蓮花隔着一個萬丈的深谷，遙遙相對。從四面佛亭向東向南看下去的風景，和在倒掛蓮花所見到的略同。不過在這一個岩鼻上，可以向西向下看一看西天目山境内的全山和寺院，這也是一點可取的地方。</p>
<p>從四面伄的岩鼻，走回來再向東略上，到半月池。再東去一里，是龍潭（或稱龍池），是東關望夫石等地方了，我們因爲肚子餓，脚力也有點不繼，所以只到了半月池爲止。</p>
<p>在開山殿裏吃過午飯，慢慢走下山來，走了三五里路，從山腰裏向東一折，居然到了四面佛絕壁下的一塊平地的上面。這地方名東塢坪，禪源寺的始建者玉林（亦作琳）國師的塔院，就在這裏，墓碣題爲三十一世玉琳琇法師之塔院。</p>
<p>由東塢坪再向西向南的下山，到了五里亭，仍上來時的原路；回到昨晚的宿處禪源寺，已經是午後四點多鐘了。重遇見了語堂，大家就都誇大幾百倍地說上面風景的怎麽好怎麽好，不消說在Ｗａｈｒｂｅｉｔ上面又加了　許多多的Ｄｉｃｂｔｕｎｇ目的不外乎想使語堂發生點後悔，這又是人性惡的個證明。但語堂也是一位大Ｄｉｃｈｔｅｒ，那裏肯甘心示弱，於是乎他也有了他的迭希通。</p>
<p>晚上當然仍留禪源寺的客房裏宿。</p>
<p>在西天目這禪源寺裏化去了兩夜和一天，總算也約略的把西天目的面貌看過了，但探勝窮幽，則完全還談不上。不過袁中郎所說的飛泉，奇石，菴字，雲峯，大樹，茶荀的天目六絕，我們也都已經嘗到，祇因雷雨不作，沒有聽到如婴啼似的雷聲，却是一恨。光旦，增椵軰亦是好勝者流，說：『袁中郎總沒有看到冰柱！』這話倒眞也不錯。</p>
<p>西天目禪源寺有田産極多，故而每年收入也不少；　家的施捨，做水陸的收入，少算算一年中也有十餘萬元。全山的茅篷，全寺的二三百僧侣，吃飯穿衣是當然不成問題的。至於寺内的組織，和和尚的性慾問題等，大約是光旦的得意題目、我在此地，只好略去。</p>
<p>（遊東天目）</p>
<p>三月三十一日，星期六，晴而不朗。</p>
<p>晨八時起床，早餐後，坐轎出禪源寺而東去；渡蟠龍橋，涉朱頭陀嶺，過旭日峯而下至一谷，沿溪行，是發源於泥嶺北坑的東關谿的支流。昨天自倒掛蓮花看下來的扇中的一谷，就是這裏的嘉德前鄕等地方，到了此地，我們的一批人馬，已成了扇子畫上的人物了。天目兩山相距，約三十餘里，自西徂東、經六角嶺（俗稱），門嶺等險峻石山，然後到東天目西　的新谿。東山下有一箇昭明庵在，下轎小息，看了一塊古文選　的區額，和一座小小的太子塔；再上山·行十里，就可以看得見東天目昭明襌院的鐘樓與分經台。</p>
<p>我們這一次來，係由藻溪下車，先至西天目而倒行上東天目的，若欲先上東天目去，則應在化龍站下車，北行三十里卽達。總之，無論先東後西，或先西後東，若欲巡拜這兩座名山，而作浙西之暢遊者，那一箇兩山之間的大谷，與三條嶺，數條溪，四五箇村莊，必須經過。桃李松杉，間雜竹樹：田地方方，流水繞之；三面高山，向南低落，南山隱隱，若臣僕之拱北宸，說到這一箇東西兩天目之間的鄕村妙景，倒也着實有點兒可愛。</p>
<p>從照明庵東上的那一條天目山脚，俗稱老虎尾巴。到五里亭而至一小山之脊。從此一里一亭，盤旋上山，經過拚虎石，碎玉坡而至螺獅旋的路側，就看得見東西白龍池下的那箇東崖瀑布了。這瀑布懸兩峯之間，老遠看過去，還有數丈來高，瀑聲隱隱若雷鳴，但可望而不可卽。我們因限於日期，不能慢慢的去尋幽探險，所以對於這東崖瀑布，只在路上遙致了　一箇敬禮。</p>

<p>— 梅中一</p>
<p>華紗呆滯原因，雖未必盡如來書所云，或者所云也是不整之一端</p>
<p>，作者旣係紗廠職員，其所談似較親切，并且華人所開工廠，不但紗廠如此，卽其他工廠，也恐不免習此種情形，這是中國實業家所普通習慣。因將梅君來函，亟錄於后，以資參考，記者附誌</p>
<p>近日報章，時載華商紗廠不堪維持，將交銀行管理及實行减工停工之說，然究其根源；華商紗廠之所以不振，雖受日紗傾銷侵奪之故，但大半情形，實爲廠方不知改良！</p>
<p>作者亦係紗廠職員，對於紗業情形，略知一二，茲因目覩本國紗廠一蹶不振，不忍坐視其倒閉，特不揣冐昧，將廠方腐敗情形，叙錄於後；望廠商速卽奮起，消除積幣，則前途發展，無可限量。一得一失，祈我廠商深鑒之·！</p>
<p>甲·職員職務，不是依才錄用。</p>
<p>乙·經理及高級職員，辦事腐敗：</p>
<p>（一）架子太大，意氣凌人</p>
<p>（二）不守時刻；九時辦公，到十時方跚跚而來；甚者，午刻尚未起身，到下午二三時，方見蹤跡；</p>
<p>（三）對於下級職員的一切，不加以一些指導和訓練。</p>
<p>丙·廠方對於工友，賞罰不明。</p>
<p>丁·對於原棉，不加以嚴明儉查。（以致貨色低劣）</p>
<p>戊·機器老式；以致出貨遲緩，工資增加。職員不依才錄用，且皆有私人介紹，皇親國威，來頭很粗，馬虎從事，平日亦不親到工塲考察研究，以致流幣百出，誤用飛花，貨色常與様子不符；至於客帮出貨，又加廠費，每包約三五角不等，以致對於買方面成本有礙。其最可恨者，若客帮銷路稍形活動，則高抬市價，拉緊不放，而日紗遂從此傾銷，客帮因需要，而出於不得。廠内跑街，亦自高身分，對於掮客及客帮不能謙和，且甚舞私營弊，自己設立字號，操縱廠方行市，客銷之所以淸淡，實爲此等人所累。於是存貨日積月累，廠方無法出售，向銀行或錢莊方面商量抵押，而廠方常此貼利，日遷月移，廠方負担無形加重，致有不堪維持之說，然尚空談救濟，無補於事；若廠方不根本改良，弭除積幣弊，消免惡習，則千斤重担，焉能脫肩。關於外商方面：八時辦公，又時常到工塲考查研究，對於工人，賞罰有分；如遇客銷，亟力遷就，常抱薄利多銷主義，五時之後，亦常可接洽，做事不若我國馬虎。據吾友人相告，『去年外商大都盈餘。』回顧我國紗廠如何？</p>
<p>作者非長他人威風，滅自己志氣。高談救濟，空手狂呼，此愚人之爲，根本非自勉不可，否則將來地位被奪，實堪虞也。一得一失，祈深察之。</p>
<h3 id="c309">人與社會 <a href="#c309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— 建設</p>
<p>我們應有集團的活動</p>
<p>有時候，一種親愛的人，常常想把自已的心情化爲人家的心情，把自已的思想替代人家的思想。這難是悖理的，但有時因爲那種眞情的推致，却實在令人感激。這種人是可愛的，但亦祗可愛而已。</p>
<p>說着某種事物不好的人，心理總有一種以爲好的事物。這種事物雖然自己是認爲優好的，但出禁不住别人否認起　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　感覺到人生的許多活動是白費的。</p>
<p>不過依我想，什麽事總有一個眞理。各持一端，未必彼此都是眞理。若不是，那我們便沒有是非。那不是成了紛擾的一團麽？</p>
<p>關於參加社會活動，原是各人的意見不同。在這裏，我總想把『應不應』的問題擱置不談，祇問：我們是不是人羣中的一個呢？</p>
<p>這點我想信誰都會肯定的，因爲誰都不能說自己是『非人。』假使這點是承認了，那麽，我就要提問：你每天吃的飯是怎様來的呢？是你煮的麽？是你買來的注麽？是你　米從　　是弄出來的麽？是你把榖運起來的麽？是你種的稻子麽？問了這，　我還要問，你每天穿的衣是怎様來和呢？···還有你的住房，你的娱樂，你的讀物·····？</p>
<p>要是能够作如是想的人，那他就會發覺；生活與社會是不能分開的。沒有社會，有便不能展開他的生活。</p>
<p>然而社會不是一個人能組成。它是需要一大羣人，許多的人才能組織的。一個組織成了的社會便發生這様的一種機能，凡屬社會中的個人，就必須秉着分工合作的原則各自盡着各自的能力。然而各個分開的力，是沒有什麽效能的，它必定要受支配於這社會的機能，便由分散的個人而成爲集團的整力。以這集團的整力而從事於一種社會生産的事情，才有整個的人類幸福可講。於是我們個的也才有個人的安全和個的的幸福可言了。</p>
<p>所以一個要想自己安全。要想自己幸福的人，他便非認淸他是屬於人羣中的一員，他的安全，他的幸福是系屬於社會的安全，系屬於人類的幸福不可。假使認淸了這點，那麽關於我們整個社會的安全和幸福的團體活動，我們是不是必要參加呢？</p>
<p>應該不應該，似乎是心理的。我且不談它。我只要說明這一點，社會是包括我們全體的，我們不能單獨的個人生活。爲了自己的生活，自己的安全，自己的幸福，爲什麽我們不參加這保障我們的生活，促進我們的社會的　般團體活動呢？</p>
<p>、所以，關於道德的辯論，關於所謂『卑鄙的行爲呀』，『險賊的心呀』，『鈎心鬥角呀』，『政治手腕的練習呀』，『出賣的凖備呀』，等等，我都覺得不必辯論。祇要大前堤認淸楚了，至於現在的情形，卽或有些不如意的疵點，那又有什麽關係呢？那不是祇要改掉就行了　麽？若爲了這點竟根本地反對參加團體生活的人，我却有些疑惑他是中了某種的毒害。</p>
<h3 id="c310">性敎育 <a href="#c310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>用神秘的眼光來看任何的事物是一種錯誤。世界上有一種事實存在着，就决不會有秘密的可能。</p>
<p>一般人都以爲兩性間的事是極神秘的。每逢自己的子女詢及兩性間的時候都會加以呵止，其實這是一種絕大的錯誤。社會文明的進化是基於兩性間的，要是沒有兩性，就决沒有社會。性和我們本身旣有這様密切的關係，又有什麽秘密可言呢？</p>
<p>在學校裏雖然有生理衛生學，但對於關係至深的性一方面却是删除不述的。在人生的過程中，性是一個很嚴重的問題，任何人都要經過性的生活，然而爲了　沒人指導，往往像瞎了騎馬一様地亂闖，因此生出危險慘痛的結局。</p>
<p>我是個學生，當然對於學生一方面的事比另外的更明瞭一些，所以我就拿學处一方面來試。在中學　　　　　個人的性的需要最迫急的時代。在發育完全的時候，性慾最厲害，一方面靑年們要滿足慾望，一方面又沒有人來指引一條正當的途徑，於是就産生了畸形的性慾解决方法，諸如手淫同性愛之類，差不我沒一個學生不會玩這種把戲。結果白濁，陽萎，遺精之類的性病便産生了！從報紙和厠所牆壁上那些『美不勝收』的性病廣告上看起來，中國不知該有多少性病的患者！</p>
<p>我們知道人民的强弱會影響到國家的强弱。中國旣有這許多性病的患者，所産生的女子便不會有强健的可能的。這様下去，中華民族勢必受優勝劣敗的淘汰，而致滅亡。</p>
<p>這完全是輕視了性敎育的結果！</p>
<p>報章雜誌上已經數次的呼求性敎育，然而到現在還沒有人來注意牠。也許『性』是有礙風化的吧！？也許當局諸公以爲性敎育是無關緊要的罷？中國人始終是『禮義之邦』的中國人！</p>
<p>我希望敎育當局對這個問題注意一下，我希望在學校裏所研求的不僅是學理的檢討。人敢用十二分的誠意懇求下令把『性敎育』列爲必修科之一，就是有人以張競生第二目我也不要緊。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Wang Reports at the Legislative Yuan: Diplomatic Strategies and Steps; Liu Guantun and Others Follow with Questions; Wang Provides Detailed Explanations on Issues Such as Through Train and Mail Services <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At 10:15 AM on the 20th, President Wang of the Executive Yuan reported on the diplomatic situation at the Legislative Yuan. After Wang took his seat, Sun Ke first introduced him to the assembly, followed by Fu Bingchang, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, who stated that, regarding the recent diplomatic issues in North China, they had specifically requested President Wang to attend and report on the process in order to understand the current situation. Wang then reported point by point, roughly divided into four sections: (1) The diplomatic process before and after Puyi's enthronement as emperor in March of this year; (2) The handling of piecemeal diplomatic issues raised by Japan regarding North China following Puyi's enthronement, such as through train and mail services; (3) The discussions held in Nanchang with the two chairmen, Chiang and Huang; (4) The significance of the declaration issued by the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the important statement by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After the report, Legislator Liu Guantun raised the issue of Liu Guitang and Yang Houxiao, stating that the bandit Liu was rampant in several provinces and had not yet been eliminated, and that Yang Houxiao had recently invaded Inner Mongolia. These bandits were rampant in North China; did they have any collusion with puppet organizations, and what measures did the central government have to suppress them? Wang replied that the two bandits, Liu and Yang, were unwanted by certain parties and had no background, or connections. The current military authorities in North China were making every effort to suppress them and would soon eliminate them. Next, Lou Tongsun spoke, stating that it was reported that the Pingzheng Zhengwei Hui (Beiping Political Readjustment Committee) was to have its authority expanded; was this true? He also recounted that the Pingzheng Zhengwei Hui had in the past shown a tendency to become a Northeast political branch council like before the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident). If its powers were further expanded, it would be even more unimaginable. Had the administrative authorities paid attention to this? Wang replied that the committee was originally of a temporary nature. Although the organizational regulations did not explicitly state "temporary," the committee was indeed of a temporary nature when it was established. If it became unnecessary, it could be abolished. As for expanding its authority, the committee had not made any such suggestion, or that it was not true. Then, Cheng Zhongxing asked about the issue of through train and mail services. Wang replied that diplomatic matters were always decided by the central government, and the Executive Yuan would act in accordance with the central government's intentions. Although the Japanese side was making serious threats, we had our own established policies and would never yield. Regarding issues such as through train, mail services, and the establishment of customs offices, except for the establishment of customs offices, which was no longer being mentioned, the central government was currently considering the pros and cons of the through train issue and would decide how to proceed in the future after the central government had decided. After the replies, the legislators expressed satisfaction with the responsible nature of President Wang's report on each point. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Legislative Yuan on the 20th, President Wang provided detailed explanations on issues such as through train, mail services, and the establishment of customs offices. It was heard that establishing customs checkpoints along the Great Wall, although providing a small supplement to fiscal revenue, would be tantamount to dividing the country and falling into the suspicion of recognizing the puppet state, so it had been put aside. The issue of mail services was also not being mentioned. However, for the sake of facilitating communication between foreign nationals and consulates in the Guandong (Manchuria) area and the embassy in Beiping, we will seek other means in the future, but it will definitely not be through recognizing the puppet organization. As for the through train, the central government is currently considering it and has not yet made any decisions. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 9:00 AM on the 20th, the Legislative Yuan held its 55th meeting, attended by over 70 legislators, chaired by Sun Ke. Matters under discussion: (1) Deliberation of the draft Temporary Regulations for the Punishment of Acts Impairing Silver Standard Currency; Resolved: to be submitted to the Civil Law and Finance Committees for review. (2) Deliberation of the draft amendment to the Civil Procedure Law; Resolved: to be submitted to the original drafters for review. (3) Report by the Finance Committee of this Yuan on the review of the draft Railway Construction Public Bonds Regulations; Resolved: to be passed as reviewed. Discussion concluded at 10:00 AM, followed by President Wang's attendance at the meeting, reporting in great detail on the current diplomatic authorities' strategies and steps, adjourning at 12:00 noon. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles report that the news that our side was considering accepting the issue of through train and mail services due to Huang Fu's suggestion, and that Arima would stay in Shanghai for concrete negotiations with Huang, is completely untrue.

<p>(Tianjin) According to a report received by the Industry Bureau on the 20th, all workers at the Lincheng Mine resumed work this morning, and the turmoil at the mine has subsided. 90% of the workers at the Tangjiazhuang Mine have returned to work, but a small number of outside workers are still observing the situation. Their leader, the reactionary element Zhang Futing, was shot dead by the police during the riot on the 17th, leaving them without leadership, and the group has dispersed. Their return to work is only a matter of time. On the 20th, over a hundred Tangjiazhuang Mine workers armed themselves and went to the Lincheng Mine to cause trouble, and the old Lincheng Mine workers' union also took precautions to prevent them from entering the mine. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong stated that the turmoil at the Kailuan Tangjiazhuang and Lincheng mines has subsided, and police teams are strictly monitoring the small number of outside workers who have not returned to work. This labor unrest was caused by troublemaking between new and old factions of workers and is not a major issue. It is rumored that Zhao Dazhong has arrived in Yutian, but the Provincial Government has not received a report. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Industry circles report that Kailuan suffered a loss of 750,000 yuan. It was reported that a strike restarted on the 17th, leading to a tragic incident. The Ministry of Industry received a report from the bureau on the evening of the 19th, stating that some workers seemed to be on the verge of a work stoppage, but it did not mention any serious clashes or worker deaths or injuries. Whether this is true is unclear, as no follow-up report has been received, and a telegram has been sent to inquire for clarification and handling. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) As of today, the Hebei Provincial Government has received over twenty reports from counties in Luandong about the Japanese army entering and exiting the country to conduct surveys, draw maps, and take photographs, and over ten reports of the erection of military telephone lines. The Japanese army has already erected a military telephone line from Luan County to Qian'an. The county magistrate of Xinglong telegraphed the province on the 19th, stating that the Japanese army had erected a long-distance military telephone line from Malanyu to Xinglong, which was now in operation. Yu Xuezhong therefore telegraphed Yin Rugeng on the 20th, asking him to lodge a protest with the Japanese to remove it. The county magistrate of Qian'an telegraphed the province, reporting that several hundred Japanese soldiers had arrived from Luan County to conduct field artillery drills and were encamped in the county seat.

<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zhangjiakou states that Song Zheyuan inspected the results of opium prohibition among the people in the various townships of Eastern Chahar, and most of it has been cleared. Zhangjia telegraphed Song from Zhangbei on the 19th, stating that he planned to go to Xilingol League and Xuanhua and station himself at Prince De's residence, because bandits often appeared in the Pangjiang area, requesting Song to return to the province to meet and discuss and then send troops to escort him. Song replied by telegram today that he would return to Zhangjiakou soon to discuss everything. Japanese aircraft fly over Chicheng and Guyuan every day for reconnaissance and scatter propaganda, which is absurd and mostly intended to lure the people to rebel. The people in the area have become accustomed to the Japanese aircraft's reconnaissance and are not afraid. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

The Provincial Government replied by telegram that they must thoroughly reduce the team to 1,000 men. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles report that the Japanese side has recently created a variety of perceptions regarding its diplomacy towards China, such as the rumor that Japan is changing its foreign policy towards China. This perception can be directly determined to be a means of probing our side's views. Our side has not received any reports of a so-called change in Japan's policy towards China, but aggression against China has always been Japan's consistent policy, with only varying degrees of urgency, not a change. Our side will still respond according to the original steps. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Indignant Words on Reading the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Statement <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>On the 17th and 18th of this month, the spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry repeatedly issued official statements. The main points of these statements were twofold: (1) Japan's stance on dealing with China is not consistent with that of other powers. Japan will exert all its strength to promote its policies. (2) Japan upholds a Monroe Doctrine for East Asia, opposing any joint action by international organizations to assist China. If various countries seek to implement international cooperation to assist China, even if it means resorting to force, Japan will also resort to force to contend with them. After the issuance of this statement, the people of our country were filled with indignation and rose up in protest. Even countries around the world were strongly stimulated, shocked by the arrogance of Japan's attitude. When the intense atmosphere of world opinion reached Hirota's ears, he changed course, sending telegrams to ambassadors stationed abroad to cover up and justify his actions. This is something that the authorities of that country are good at.</p>
<p>There are reasons that can be explained for Japan's sudden issuance of such an outright statement. First, they believe that Japan-US relations have gradually improved, and the cordiality between Hull and Saito has swept away the dark clouds over the Pacific. It may be possible to take another step to test the extent of America's patience in seeking compromise. Second, Soviet-Japanese relations are worsening. Japan has no certainty as to whether the Soviet Union will abandon its interests in northern Manchuria. It may be possible to test the true intentions of the Soviet Union. Third, Japan has learned that the League of Nations lacks the power to intervene in Far Eastern events. British diplomacy, on the other hand, takes supporting the League of Nations as its fundamental principle. This point is incompatible, and economic conflicts between Britain and Japan are not easy to reconcile. Political relations may also reverse too easily. By this move, Japan directly opposes the League of Nations' technical cooperation with China and indirectly probes the true intentions of the British. Fourth, the Chinese people have endured in silence for more than two years, but the anti-Japanese sentiment has not wavered, and the construction efforts have progressed. Once Japan engages in war with other countries, the Chinese people will inevitably take the opportunity to rise up and restore their past losses. Therefore, Japan wants to seize the initiative with intimidating words, so that the Chinese government and the public understand that it is not wise to enlist foreign aid and willingly submit to its iron heel.</p>
<p>Therefore, the motive for Japan's move can be summarized by the phrase "probing the atmosphere." As for the United States and Britain, they both expressed amazement at Japan's threatening statement, but they each held different attitudes. The United States' greatest hope for overseas market development lies in China, so it tries its best to uphold the principles of open door and equal opportunity. Japan's monopolistic policy is what the US opposes. However, they are currently suffering from domestic economic panic and are unwilling to take practical action. Therefore, in addition to expressing unease and shock, they can only offer some sympathy to our country. Britain's attitude still seems calm, but preparations for responding to the situation have never been neglected. It is feared that the intensification of the confrontation between Britain and Japan may be greater than that between the US and Japan. It is uncertain.</p>
<p>What kind of determination and decisiveness should our country's diplomatic authorities have when dealing with this kind of international situation, looking forward and backward? However, judging from the statements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs personnel, it does not seem that they can clearly show where the real intention of our people lies. Today, we dare to tell the Japanese authorities directly that the correct path to be taken for Sino-Japanese friendship and the basic requirements to be followed for maintaining peace in East Asia have all been destroyed by Japan's past and present policies of military aggression. If Japan is determined to implement the absurd statement, it will only accelerate the catastrophe and bring about future wars. There must be a certain limit to the compromise of China's diplomatic negotiations. Beyond this limit, we must do our best to fight. Even if we have to sacrifice everything, we will not hesitate. At present, our country's strength is indeed very weak, but the national consciousness is growing day by day. The longer the resentment between the people of the two countries brews, the more violently it will erupt. At the same time, we also want to tell our people that the ambitions of the Japanese will never be satisfied. We should make persistent efforts to develop our own hidden strength. Only when the nation is strong can the government have a strong backing for its unyielding diplomacy. If the Chinese nation, with thousands of years of glorious history, truly does not want to be destroyed by our hands, it must urgently promote the spirit of unremitting self-improvement and quickly prepare for self-salvation with real strength.</p>

<p>Anti-Japanese Hero Li Xuanfeng Commits Suicide (Changchun) On the 18th, over a hundred members of the Righteous Army attacked the puppet customs at Tumen. Japanese and puppet customs officials, including Miyamoto and five others, were seriously injured. The Righteous Army set fire to the customs building and left. (20th Hualian Telegram)</p>
<p>The Hualian News Agency in Harbin reports that Li Xuanfeng, the leader of the Righteous Army, committed suicide on March 19th by jumping from the fifth-floor window of an inn, under the strict encirclement of Japanese and puppet troops and police. It has been found that Li has led the Righteous Army in resisting Japan and opposing the puppet regime for the past two years, rising up again and again, and never fearing. Li was only twenty-three years old and had long been tracked by the Japanese and puppet authorities, who regarded him as an irreconcilable enemy. It is believed in all quarters that the bombing of bridges and the dismantling of railway tracks were mostly planned by Li.</p>

<p>(London) The Daily Mail today carried a Washington dispatch stating that, due to Japan's current attitude of "restraining China," the US government has resolved to propose to Britain the possibility of a joint Anglo-American policy in the Far East. The reporter said that this resolution was decided after lengthy consultations between Secretary of State Hull and British Ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Lindsay. The Daily Mail also heard from a Rome reporter that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini may propose suggestions for dealing with Japan's foreign policy. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States has not yet received the official original text of Japan's declaration that other countries should not be involved in Chinese affairs. Therefore, the State Department and other official venues are temporarily refraining from criticism. According to well-informed sources, Japan's new policy contains the potential to reiterate the Twenty-One Demands on a larger scale. It is expected that Japan's declaration will create a major problem in the Far East. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Reuters News Agency has learned that the British government plans to ignore the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson's statement on Japan's China policy, as this statement was only made to journalists and was not transmitted through diplomatic channels. However, if the United States sends a document requesting Britain to discuss the matter, the issue will be considered by Britain; otherwise, the authorities will probably not pay attention to it. Sir Robert Clive, the British Ambassador to Tokyo, sent a very simple report on this matter, only asking the government to pay attention to the news reports and the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson's comments that Reuters telegraphed to London. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The claim in the London Daily Mail that the US government will propose that the US and Britain adopt a joint policy in the Far East is unfounded. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US is extremely concerned and has expressed disappointment about the recent statement by the Japanese Foreign Ministry that Japan intends to monopolize the situation in China and other Asian countries in order to maintain "Far Eastern peace." Although the State Department has avoided officially criticizing Japan's statement, other government officials and members of Congress have not remained silent. Senator Robinson of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said, "This is another indication of Japan's desire for aggression and a threat to peace in the Pacific. This policy is arrogant, and Japan's actions are particularly unsettling after the exchange of documents between Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota and US Secretary of State Hull." Senator Borah said, "The United States has insisted on the open-door policy for decades and will now oppose any new policy of closing the door." Furthermore, government officials unofficially stated that if Japan's statement is put into practice, it will be tantamount to financially blockading China, and they strongly suspect that Japan intends to dominate Asia. American newspapers have unanimously condemned Japan's statement and expressed skepticism. Editorials in most major newspapers expressed significant regret, recognizing that Japan's actions are sufficient to hinder the United States' belief in the gradual restoration of the situation in the Pacific after Hirota and Hull exchanged documents and the US fleet withdrew to the Atlantic. The influence of the recent visit of Japanese goodwill envoys to the US and Japan's expressions of improving relations with the US has also changed. The initial reaction of Americans was that Japan's move was a kind of probing, but after the news was confirmed, the national atmosphere changed dramatically, with a general sense of not knowing what to do. The Navy Department was particularly pessimistic. Senior naval officers and naval experts are now expressing concern about the next naval conference, and any protests against Japan's new policy will cause many disputes and will involve the definition of "what constitutes military assistance." The US government has not sent advisors to the Chinese government, nor has it supplied airplanes or munitions. Although American companies have sold airplane parts to China, this is commercial in nature and is no different from selling to the Japanese government. Under current laws, the US government has no power to prohibit American people from serving as commissioned officers or instructors in Japan, China, or elsewhere, nor can it prohibit private companies from selling airplanes and other manufactured goods.

<h3 id="e20">Japanese Foreign Ministry Statement Demands Special Status in the Far East Does Not Wish to Interfere in China's Independence <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After the Foreign Ministry spokesperson issued comments on China policy on Tuesday, news reporters questioned him one after another. The spokesperson made a special statement to answer this morning, saying that he was very surprised that his previous comments caused such a great reaction, saying that this was only a supplement to the speech made by Foreign Minister Hirota in the Diet on January 23. Japan does not harbor the will to interfere in China's independence. What we want is the unification and prosperity of China, knowing that if Japan and China are united, and if China is unified and prosperous, then Japan can gain the benefit of increased trade. However, China's unification and prosperity must be obtained through China's awakening and China's own efforts, not by selfish powers who can overstep their bounds to seek it. It is important to know that the era in which the powers or the League of Nations used their power to slightly seize China for their own benefit is now over. The spokesperson ended by saying that Japan does not want to interfere with the benefits that the powers enjoy in managing trade to benefit China, and that Japan has no intention of deviating from its open-door and equal opportunity policy, or of infringing on existing treaties. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The informal statement by the Foreign Ministry regarding Japan's attitude toward China has received a considerable response from various parties. Among them, there are those who misunderstand Japan's intentions. Foreign Minister Hirota telegraphed the full text of the statement to ambassadors and ministers abroad yesterday to dispel this misunderstanding, clarifying that this was only a reiteration of the information in Foreign Minister Hirota's January 23 speech at the Imperial Diet, stating that "the Empire is the sole responsible party for maintaining peace in East Asia."

<p>(New York) A New York Times dispatch from Washington today stated that if Japan's increasingly assertive policy towards China results in a statement of position, the US government hopes to provide support behind Britain. This is known from private opinions expressed in official circles. The closure of the Chinese door will affect Britain even more than the United States, but observers currently see both countries' common interests similarly related in the current situation. Japanese Ambassador to the US Saito told a Reuters reporter today that he did not believe Tokyo had sent any official documents regarding this matter to the US State Department. He intends to meet with Secretary of State Hull within days to explain the Japanese newspapers' propaganda regarding the statements made by the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has been negotiating with China for months, and these statements have been the basis for these negotiations. Since Japan has not formally sent any documents, the US Secretary of State has no need to respond. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>(London) A dispatch from Rome to the London Times stated that it seems one cannot fully believe the statement that Japan has indeed established a kind of Monroe Doctrine towards China. If one says that Japan is prepared to disregard the treaty rights enjoyed by the powers in China and exclusively occupy China, it is difficult to make people believe it lightly. However, Japan's policy has clearly demonstrated the reason why Italian Prime Minister Mussolini values the current situation. The failure of the European powers to implement the terms and spirit of the Four-Power Pact, even if not dangerous, can be seen as extremely unfortunate. A Washington dispatch to the British News Agency reported that Japan is likely to restore the Twenty-One Demands made to China in 1915. If Tokyo sends a note to the United States with the tone of its Foreign Ministry's declaration, an important exchange of diplomatic opinions will occur. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>(London) The London Times correspondent in Washington is deeply concerned about the statement made by the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman, saying that before the declaration is received, it is not yet known whether the United States will take a serious view, abandon the valueless Hay Doctrine, or prepare in time so that the United States can share in the trade of machines and high-quality goods in the East. This question is deeply engraved in the minds of those in power and cannot be discussed in the same breath as the recent exchange of mild official documents between the United States and Japan. The issue also involves Britain, Russia, and other European countries, and is a major dispute between East and West. The naval conference will also be bound by this issue. Japan is now in the process of transforming from an island nation to a continental power, and may demand naval ratios based on offensive rather than defensive grounds. If so, how is Japan different from Germany twenty years ago? (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>(London) Today, newspapers published the declaration of Japan's policy toward China under large headlines, such as "Japan's Monroe Doctrine" or "Japan's Challenge to the World," and most others were similar. Opposition leader Lansdowne told guests that Japan is only imitating what the Western powers have done. If Britain and the United States are willing to exert influence on Japan, they should first reject imperialism themselves. Since we have taught the Japanese to commit crimes, we should lead by example and teach the Japanese to repent. Conservative politician [name] will raise a question in the House of Commons next Monday asking whether Japan is now demanding to supervise China's foreign policy. It is expected that other questions will also be raised at that time. The British political world believes that Japan is angered by the fact that China has hired many advisors from the League of Nations and has not hired a single Japanese advisor. The business community is paying attention to China's recent large purchases of aircraft from the United States and Italy. The Russians have a different view, saying that Britain and the United States have been very active in building railways and developing the economy in China recently, causing the Japanese to worry about competition. Anti-Japanese observers claim that the Western countries can never accept the principle that their interests in China must rely on Japan's permission. Japan's doctrine is simply arrogant. Pro-Japanese observers say that the policies of the world's major countries have pushed Japan into a state of isolation, and Russia's military expansion, extending to the Far East, is also forcing Japan to use any means to secure its position. The general public views Japan's actions as exploratory. If there is no reaction, they will resolutely implement everything. (Special dispatch from the North China Daily News, 19th)</p>

<p>(London) The Spectator Weekly commented on Japan's declaration on its policy towards China, saying that it seems to be a challenge to any international syndicate offering loans to China, and also a challenge to the League of Nations. Japan's true intentions are unclear, but the whole world must deal with it in a united front. The European countries should resolve their own disputes and give Russia all reasonable encouragement to join the League of Nations. These two measures are more important than ever. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, British newspapers harshly criticized Japan's declaration that other countries should not interfere in Chinese affairs. The Daily Express editorial said that Japan is an old country hanging up a new empire sign and is striding arrogantly in the East, looking down on everything. Its situation is like that of Austria-Hungary, which was internally dilapidated before the war. Japan is now openly claiming that the Western powers, including the United States, must no longer provide political or military aid to China. No one except the Japanese may build airfields for China or supply China with aircraft. Japan will maintain peace in China and decide what constitutes an act that disturbs peace in China. It must be known that those who climb high will fall heavily. The diplomatic correspondent of the Morning Post stated that the Japanese Foreign Ministry's declaration has indeed aroused serious attention from the British government. In fact, this new development is not surprising to those who closely watch Japan's policies, as this policy merely adapts to Japan's tendency to regard China as its exclusive sphere of influence. The rumors that Japan is determined to demand greater rights from China are further confirmed by this. A year ago, the world might have thought that the Manchurian Incident would keep Japan temporarily preoccupied, but judging from recent events, Manchuria is not Japan's ultimate goal but merely a stepping stone for continuous aggression elsewhere. The Daily News also published an editorial severely criticizing Japan's declaration, saying that the Japanese government often takes advantage of the world's troubles to take action quickly. This challenge may not be answered by anyone because other countries are too busy taking care of themselves or view it indifferently, considering it irrelevant. Tokyo's recent demands are the biggest step to achieve its goal of reducing China to its protectorate, openly attacking China's political independence. China's independence is not only guaranteed by the Nine-Power Treaty, but other members of the League of Nations have also sworn to respect it. However, the countries cannot take action. France, while emphasizing the principles of the League of Nations Covenant, only wants to use it against Germany. British Foreign Secretary Simon seems to consistently believe that Japan's aggression against China is Japan's historical mission. So-called law and the League of Nations will now be quietly shelved. A dispatch from Rome to the Daily Telegraph reported that, according to official circles, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini now intends to seek a common and united European front to resist Japan's diplomatic policies. Official circles instructed newspapers to criticize the European countries' indifferent attitude towards Japan's declaration and said that Japan's declaration could cause serious international disputes. Fascist leader Davanzati called the declaration a threatening warning. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The French political world is currently handling the current situation between China and Japan with extreme caution, willing to wait and see the developments, and unwilling to prepare for intervention, because France is now focusing on the European disarmament issue and has no time for other matters.

<p>(Paris) Today, the Paris Echo published an article by Bertin on Japan's declaration of its policy towards China, saying that it is an unfortunate result of the mad diplomatic adventure undertaken in Geneva in 1931. The reason for this is the League of Nations' actions to help China resist Japan. In the reporter's opinion, Japan's threats can only be dealt with through direct negotiations between the United States and Japan. Although the League of Nations' construction work in China is most severely endangered, the United States and Russia are also closely related. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>Roman Italian public opinion on the new Monroe Doctrine advocated by Japanese newspapers, stating that among the powers, only Japan can comment on all aspects of China's internal affairs, is not considered serious. Therefore, the "Messenger Newspaper" raised a question, saying, "What is the intention of Japan's statement? Is it to adopt a hollow hegemony, or is it diplomatically trying to make an aggressive move to plunge the situation into misery and produce its final result? In short, we believe that the statement of the Foreign Ministry published by the Japanese newspapers is extremely ridiculous, has no value, and does not need to be taken seriously." The newspaper concluded by saying that it seems absolutely incredible and absurd to think that Japan intends to isolate China and separate it from the world. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>A communication from the China United Press in Tokyo reported that when Minister of War Hayashi remained in office, the military proposed to Prime Minister Saito that the military's domestic and foreign policies had not changed from the claims and recommendations of the Araki era. At that time, the main policies of the military were reiterated, and the Prime Minister was asked not to misunderstand the world situation and to earnestly implement the military's claims. The main policy points were as follows: (1) Foreign policy: At the next disarmament conference, in view of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations and its support for "Manchukuo," it should advocate an Asian Monroe Doctrine. Nothing short of a war can break the current situation, so it should absolutely advocate for equality in armaments. The military is fully confident about Russia. There must be no concessions in the negotiations over the Chinese Eastern Railway. The railway is already in the hands of the Japanese army. Towards China, it is necessary to base actions on the Twenty-One Demands and oppose all countries creating influence, and all white actions under the guise of military construction or economic construction must be opposed across the board. The military made an attempt on China in May of last year, and since then, it has taken action from time to time. The Foreign Ministry must not oppose this because of diplomatic relations with the United States. (2) Manchurian economic issues: The military is determined to oppose the zaibatsu fostering power in Manchuria. Manchuria must be a place for the development of farmers and soldiers. (3) Domestic affairs: The internal affairs conference should be reopened to adopt the economic policies proposed by the military. This policy is nothing more than a form of national mobilization. Furthermore, discipline must be rectified, and government officials' corruption cases must not be politically interfered with in order to restore the people's faith in the government.</p>

<h3 id="e29">United States Pursuing International Monetary Agreement, Minting Silver Coins Based on Silver-Gold Ratio <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Political and diplomatic circles predict that the United States and other countries are about to conclude an international agreement in order to mint silver coins in accordance with a unified gold-silver ratio among the countries. Regarding this matter, talks have been held among the countries in recent days, and an international conference will be proposed for discussion after considerable results have been achieved. Well-informed sources believe that President Roosevelt deeply wishes to avoid being forced to pass legislation on silver during the current congressional session. The aforementioned international talks are related to the President's wishes. It is generally explained that if the various bills for minting silver coins currently submitted to Congress are passed, there will be no possibility of establishing any international agreements on silver. According to reports, the US government recently sent two currency experts, Roasborth and Tang, to China and Japan to investigate. One of them was tasked with estimating the amount of silver stored in the Far East. In addition, the US government sent financial observers to other countries. President Roosevelt originally scheduled a meeting with Senator King, a representative of the silver group, for today. This meeting has now been postponed to next Monday. Thomas, one of the leaders of the Senate silver group (who recently proposed nationalizing silver in the Senate), also declared that members of Congress related to monetary issues, especially silver issues, will soon convene a meeting. Currency experts, such as Professor Warren, the founder of the "dollar commodity" theory, believe that the combination of silver and the world's monetary system would stabilize world prices, and after silver is minted into world currency, the total amount of world currency will increase, and the basis for international trade will also increase in the same proportion. However, it is still difficult to determine which countries can join this international agreement because no one knows the current global silver reserves. According to Professor Warren's estimates, the amount of silver minted into currency in the hundred years from 1813 to 1930 should reach 30,191,750 tons. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>(New York) Here, speculation on a European war is underway. The ratio of those who do not believe that a war will occur in Europe in the next twelve months is 107 to 1. However, the ratio of those who predict that a war will occur within two years is 140 to 1. War insurance underwriters in London dare not underwrite war insurance for five years, even if they get extremely high premiums. The terror of war has made insurers feel highly threatened. This is really caused by the stimulation of military activities. The manufacturing of armaments in various countries is becoming increasingly strained. In the Creusot area in the wine-producing regions of southern France, the sky is now shrouded in smoke. The Skoda factory in Czechoslovakia, the Vickers-Armstrongs plant in the United Kingdom, the Mitsui plant in Japan, and other armament manufacturing plants are all in a state of chained tension. From Washington to Tokyo, there are alert armament managers selling munitions. The United States has declared that it will build a navy for defensive purposes in order to uphold the dignity of treaties. Therefore, Britain and Japan also intend to start building new ships, using the excuse that the current treaty ratio is insufficient to cope with the current situation. Saltpeter is the raw material for explosives. This type of munition raw material has been transported through the Panama Canal and the Suez Canal. The United States has sold 25,000 tons to France. Currently, the US senators have already noticed the competition of US armament manufacturers to sell munitions and will begin an investigation into the current state of the US armament industry, advocating that the government immediately take over all armament raw material manufacturing industries. However, this investigation is very difficult and involves every citizen. For example, a farmer producing one acre of cotton, the cotton is a raw material for munitions. As for manufacturing a car or an airplane, no matter how meager its materials are, it can all be transformed into munitions. Therefore, the main raw materials for munitions are also the materials for creating civilization, and it is difficult to distinguish between them. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>

At that time, a very fast delivery method for mail to the Far East will be available, shortening the journey from London to Montreal, Canada, from six and a half days to four days. Furthermore, the method of connecting Canadian and American trains and airlines can be used to make postal delivery in North America even faster. When Canadian Pacific Railway Company ships arrive west of Ireland, airplanes can catch up and transmit mail. When the ship arrives at the St. Lawrence, airplanes can wait there to receive mail. The Canadian airplanes can take off in the summer from Belle Isle, 500 miles to Shediac in New Brunswick, and in the winter, when the mouth of the St. Lawrence River is frozen, the airplanes can take off 550 miles from Cape Race to Shediac. The east-bound aircraft will also follow this method. The Canadian airline is not yet completed, so at present, the mail can only be flown to Rimouski and then transported by rail. As for the mail passing through the Pacific, it still needs to be transported by ship, but the time from Britain to the Far East will be greatly shortened. (Reuters Communication, March 17)</p>

<p>(London) Politicians throughout Europe are deeply disturbed by the breakdown of disarmament negotiations over the past six months and the stalemate in the hostile actions of France and Germany. Germany explicitly demands the right to rearm, while France accuses it of violating the peace treaty and demands that other countries guarantee French security as a prerequisite for acknowledging Germany's military increase. German semi-official sources vehemently deny accusations that Germany's rearmament violates the Treaty of Versailles. However, British politicians have not given up hope and believe that the General Disarmament Commission to be held in Geneva on May 23rd may still achieve some success. Politicians generally believe that if European countries fail to resolve these disputes, an unprecedented arms race will begin. This is why politicians cannot bear to see the Disarmament Conference die. The failure of the Disarmament Conference is tantamount to pronouncing the death sentence of the League of Nations.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has anticipated the collapse of the Disarmament Conference. The government has not changed the policy announced to Congress on January 3rd this year. At that time, the President stated that the United States could not participate in European political issues but was willing to cooperate with European countries to complete any plan to reduce armaments and commercial obstacles. The State Department is quite concerned about the collapse of disarmament negotiations but does not express surprise. French Ambassador to the United States Paul Claudel delivered a copy of the French note to Britain to Undersecretary of State Philip. State Department officials immediately studied it. According to most officials, the French note tends to hand over the disarmament issue to the General Disarmament Commission to be held in Geneva on May 23rd and hopes that Davis can participate in the meeting as an informal representative of the United States. Although government leaders have informally stated that any rearmament goes against the purpose of the Disarmament Conference, the United States has never definitively expressed its position on Germany's demand for equality in armaments. According to most officials, European countries have been negotiating for two years, but no compromise has yet been reached on the basic principles of the disarmament convention. Instead, global military spending exceeds US$5,000,000,000 per year. In substance, the 1934 military budgets of various countries are also higher than when the Disarmament Conference opened in 1932. The United States has always maintained an observer attitude towards the Disarmament Conference, but the United States often has informal representatives participating to support various actions.

<h3 id="e43">Italy Makes a Final Effort to Save the Situation Unexpectedly <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Cabinet Disarmament Committee met tonight to study the French reply to Britain on the disarmament issue on the 19th of this month. Government officials are not eager to express a definite opinion, but believe that the speech given yesterday in Berlin by Colonel Roehm, Chief of Staff of the Nazi Party's armed forces, to foreign diplomatic representatives and journalists further proves the reasonableness of France's attitude. Italian Undersecretary of State Suvich will arrive here from Rome next week to make a final attempt to save the disarmament issue. It is generally believed that Suvich's trip is of utmost importance. In addition, the executives of the Joint Federation of Organizations Supporting the League of Nations passed a resolution stating that disarmament negotiations, as they are currently conducted, are unlikely to be effective. They advocate immediately convening the General Disarmament Commission and seeking the universal abolition of all kinds of weapons currently prohibited by treaty. (Havas Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the publication of the French reply to Britain, Italian public opinion expressed disappointment. Generally, it is believed that the Disarmament Conference is tantamount to declaring bankruptcy. Italian Undersecretary of State Suvich will go to London next week to consult with British authorities on the attitude to be adopted. Suvich's trip is considered to be of utmost importance. Italy's attitude towards the disarmament issue will probably not be clear until after Suvich goes to Britain. As for the present, there will be no statement of attitude, nor will there be any expression in the newspapers. (Havas Telegram, 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e46">Draft of the New Austrian Constitution: Leaning Towards Fascism, a Precursor to the Restoration of the Empire <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Vienna Official Gazette announced today that the new constitution has been completed. Austria's inclination towards fascism is becoming increasingly apparent. The Austrian Cabinet will meet at the end of this week to decide on the date of the promulgation of the constitution and will try to promote Archduke Otto of the Habsburg royal family to return to Austria as regent or even as the monarch of Austria. Premier Dollfuss suggested today that in order to turn the nascent republic into a fascist state, he will resign from his position as a foundation for government reorganization. A transitional constitutional rule was implemented last month as a preparation. According to Dollfuss's concept of a fascist corporate state, Austria will be reorganized by incorporating Italian fascism, German socialism, Soviet communism, syndical socialism, medieval feudalism, and Catholicism. Most European diplomats and political observers expect Austria to return to the rule of the Habsburg royal family and become a monarchy. According to observers, the construction of a fascist state is only a precursor to the construction of a monarchical state. Premier Dollfuss was born into a farming family and is a devout Catholic. He has always believed in the imperial system. The imperial system that once ruled Austria was the strongest empire in the world and the most powerful supporter of the church. Dollfuss is by nature opposed to Marxist socialism and is deeply skeptical of the so-called mechanized 20th century and the industrial revolution. After the Great War, the Austrian imperial system disintegrated, and socialism took the opportunity to rise and rule Austria for a long time until the situation began to change two years ago. At that time, Austria's economic, financial, and cultural conditions were deteriorating, and the political situation was also precarious, but there were no obvious signs on the surface. Now Premier Dollfuss plans to build a new social system to replace the parliamentary system according to the new constitution he announced yesterday. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Prince Starhemberg, leader of the Austrian Patriotic League, focused on internal Austrian issues in his political talks here, especially with Prime Minister Mussolini. Starhemberg specifically explained how the Austrian constitution is evolving, saying that Parliament will be convened in early May, but in a reduced form and with a fixed term. Within this term, Parliament's task is to prepare for constitutional amendments. Austrian government personnel will be greatly adjusted, and Prince Starhemberg will be the Deputy Prime Minister. We still remember that when Vienna was in chaos and the Austrian government punished the Socialist Party, Italian newspapers praised Dollfuss and Prince Starhemberg equally. Since then, Italian newspapers have said that Dollfuss should take the opportunity to amend the constitution so that Austria is closer to Pan-Germanism. At that time, it was generally advocated that Prince Starhemberg should cooperate closely with the Austrian government. The situation was like this on that day, so the reason why Prince Starhemberg came to Rome on the eve of the constitutional amendment to contact all parties can be imagined. It is widely rumored that when Prince Starhemberg arrived here, German Deputy Prime Minister Papen was about to leave Rome to return to his country, and the two had met. It is also said that Prince Starhemberg came this time to consult with Italy on the purchase of military equipment. Various rumors have been clearly denied. However, during Prince Starhemberg's stay in Rome, he will examine the political system that the Pan-German Party has implemented for a long time. This is what the leaders of the National Socialist Party always do. (Havas Telegram, 19th)</p>

<p>(London) The House of Commons has concluded the general debate on the budget bill today. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain spoke to defend his proposal, saying that the government has put aside class concepts and only wants to fairly restore the sacrifices of the people in 1931. Some criticize the government for being too considerate. It must be known that the current budget bill does not have additional budget regulations. Regarding the Liberal Party leader Samuel's claim that the government is helping to promote economic nationalism through the Ottawa treaties, he feels that economic nationalism is not showing signs of shrinking in the coming years. The government has adopted any possible methods to maintain Britain's position as a center of international trade through commercial treaties. Seeing that international trade is gradually shrinking, it went to Ottawa to establish the foundation of internal trade within the empire. Although the people in overseas autonomous regions are limited, commerce has not yet had a major development, but the opportunities for the future are infinite. (Reuters Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The Parliamentary Committee of Special Privileges, which was ordered to investigate Churchill's accusations that former Indian Affairs officials Hoare and Bobbie abused their powers, met for the first time in the House of Commons today and decided to ask Churchill to attend the meeting on Monday to explain the accusations he made. The committee elected British Prime Minister MacDonald as chairman. Churchill previously stated that Hoare and Bobbie used pressure to change the opinion of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce on the issue of Indian constitutional reform, which was quite surprising to those who heard it. However, Hoare was calm and said that the facts are there and can prove that what Churchill said was unfounded. (Reuters Telegram, 19th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to a Reuters telegram, the interior of Tibet is still extremely chaotic. According to Gesang Zeren of the Mongolian Commission, he received a telegram yesterday from the leaders of various people's armies in Kangnan. According to an urgent report from Xikang, the people of Kang in various parts west of the Jinsha River in central and southern Kang are jointly resisting the Tibetan troops, disarming the Tibetan troops, sending them back to Tibet empty-handed, and detaining many Tibetan generals (Deputies), such as Longjin Lengba. This movement initially started in Jiangka Yanjing and other places. The Yanjing people's army also killed the pro-Tibetan Lama Huangga. For a time, the movement surged. The people of Kang in Gongjue Zaya and other places also responded. Tibet's rule in Kang is about to be greatly shaken. At present, the Xikang people's army in each of these areas has dispatched Fuka, the son of Bangda Chang, to Ba'an to contact the various people's armies in Kangnan and declared that the purpose of the Kang people's actions is to demand the establishment of Xikang Province and promote Tibet's obedience to the central government. At the same time, they hope that the Panchen Lama will return to Tibet as soon as possible and that the Dalai Lama will be reincarnated calmly, so as to avoid the current authorities in Tibet from arbitrarily destroying the old political and religious system in order to revive the entire Tibetan nation. At the same time, the local people's army has now requested Liu Wenhui, Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan-Xikang Border Defense, to send personnel to inspect. Liu has already sent Liu Zhou, who is stationed in Ba'an, to go nearby. (Special Telegram, 20th)</p>

The bandits fled southeast to Zhu Cao, no more than four or five miles from Ganyu County in Jiangsu.

<p>American Cotton: Cotton brokers have a more pleasant interest today, but the market price fell at the opening due to the closure of long positions and selling by the South and local sellers. Demand from domestic merchants, European merchants, and Liverpool is still strong, but cotton is still trending downward due to the continuous closure of long positions and the concern caused by news of silver expansion. The market situation is quiet when prices fall. Indian Cotton: The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to the closure of long positions and selling by retail investors and Japanese merchants, but rebounded slightly due to purchases by European exporters.

<p>The New York stock market opened today with stability, and prices were slightly higher. This is because the market's recent performance can be seen as a sign of its strong underlying position. Furthermore, the weakness of the US dollar and sluggish commodity prices have led to renewed talk of inflation, which is another reason for the stock market's stable opening. However, a sense of anxiety still clearly exists, and market conditions are fluctuating and uncertain. Merchants are still being very cautious and waiting for developments. The volume of transactions in the first hour after the opening was 510,000 shares.

<h3 id="e116">Inspection Report from the Northwest Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya: Current Situation of Suiyuan Construction <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>At 3:00 AM on the 8th, we departed from Datong, still on the Xikai PingSui train. At daybreak, we arrived at Pingdiquan. Looking out the window, everything was white. I then realized that it had snowed heavily. The further west we went, the thicker the snow became. The snow-covered willows on both sides were especially crystal clear and dazzling, truly possessing the elegance of "Suddenly, like a spring breeze overnight, thousands and thousands of pear trees bloom." The land along the way was flat and wide, with the Sui River flowing smoothly. The water and grass were lush and beautiful, very suitable for cultivation and grazing. Occasionally, we saw smoke rising from what were mostly cave dwellings. The doors and walls were often painted with white circles or white tigers, which, I heard, were used to scare away wolves at night. In Fushengzhuang, there was a cave dwelling with walls made of cut earth. A passage through the middle served as the door. On the right was written "Eight-Strand Rope Shop," and on the left was written "Tea and Water Provided." Next to it was a drawing of a person carrying goods, with the words "Liu (likely a typo for "Stay") Person" written beside it. It was clear that this was a roadside inn. As for the shop's name, "Eight-Strand Rope," it was because the travelers passing by, whether they were using camels or porters, could not do without this item.</p>
<p>At first, we saw snow-covered willows, but gradually they disappeared. To the right of the road, the mountains were bare. Occasionally, we saw flocks of sheep, sometimes near, sometimes far, moving slowly. The earth houses in the rural villages had flat roofs, on which cow dung was piled up for fuel. In the Baitajing area, there was a sandy beach stretching as far as the eye could see, some of which seemed to have been reclaimed, while others were still barren. Along the PingSui railway line, the vacant land on both sides had been surveyed and marked by the government. Apart from the land that had already been leased for cultivation, there were still more than 3,200 mu available. Even with the lowest rent of five jiao per mu, no one came forward to lease it. The vast land and sparse population of the Northwest were already evident here.</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM, we got off the train in Guisui. The cold wind after the snow made my ears ache terribly. There were more than a dozen sedan chairs in front of the station. The horses were mostly fat and lovely. It is indeed true that Chahar and Suiyuan produce good horses. The city has two parts, the old and the new, about four or five li apart. Government offices are mostly in the new city, while commerce and industry are entirely in the old city. The "New City Road" we passed through was well-built and smooth, with trees lining the road reaching a height of thirty zhang, neatly arranged. In the summer, the shade must be lush and refreshing. The "September 18th Memorial Hall," currently under construction, is located right next to the road on the north side. Since I came to the north, I don't seem to have seen the words "September 18th" anywhere. Now, suddenly seeing it in the border region gave me quite a shock.</p>
<p>I visited Mr. Feng Xi, the Director of the Suiyuan Provincial Construction Department, who spoke to me about the construction work in Suiyuan Province, which is very important. The following is a summary of his remarks:</p>
<p>Suiyuan is a base for the construction of the Northwest. To develop the Northwest, one must start with Suiyuan. However, trying to do everything at once is not allowed by financial resources and time. It is better to start with transportation, roads, telecommunications, water conservancy, agriculture, animal husbandry, and afforestation, and then proceed gradually. Suiyuan Province is originally a culturally backward area. For all construction plans, the first thing to do is to make the people understand, then train and test them, and then put them into practice. In recent years, the benefits of the work have been as follows. Suiyuan has a lot of desert land, and transportation has always been difficult. Repairing roads is extremely important. The roads that have been completed are: Baotou to Wulahai, 700 li, with 42 bridges; Jining to Taolin, 120 li; Fengzhen to Xinghe, 100 li; Suiyuan to Bailingmiao, 340 li; Qingshuihe to Helin, 150 li; Tuoketuo to Guisui, 140 li; the Bawanghe Bridge; and the roads in Guibao, 30 li. The construction of Jiazi Bridge, Suiyuan Bridge, Public Security Bridge, Datong Bridge, etc., is also underway. All the roads are being expanded.</p>
<p>The counties with completed telephone lines are: Fengzhen, Xinghe, Liangcheng, Helin, Saxian, Tongqu, etc. The loop lines in places such as Guisui, Wuchuan, Guyang, Wuyuan, Anbei, Tuoketuo, and Linhe can all be connected this year.</p>
<p>Coal is the most abundant mineral, but there are no government-run mines. Commercially operated mines, such as Shigou Gou, Yingpanwan, and Gongjiban, all have very rich reserves. However, they are only sold in the province and there are no large-scale exports. If there is capital for large-scale mining, the benefits will be immeasurable.</p>
<p>In order to improve agriculture, the Construction Department has established a Farmers' Training Institute, which has already completed eight sessions, graduating a total of 480 people. It has also commissioned farmers to trial planting American improved wheat, Fengtian soybeans, Daixian tobacco leaves, and Guangling hemp. An agricultural product competition is held every year, and has now been held four times. Each county has formed a rural credit cooperative, with 72 cooperatives and nearly 1,000 members. In addition, the department is also vigorously promoting industrial crops.</p>
<p>In terms of animal husbandry, a sheep farm has been established in Wuchuan Naorenyer, where 100 Merino sheep have been purchased. Currently, there are more than 600 improved sheep and local breeds. This year, the organization of a livestock breeding farm and dozens of improved sheep farms will be expanded. Since 1932, a horse breeding competition has been held every year, expanding the horse market, sports competitions in spring and autumn, and more than 140 foreign stallions have been purchased and distributed to Wuchuan, Guyang, and other places to improve the horse breeds.</p>
<p>In terms of agriculture and forestry, a special agricultural and forestry experimental farm has been established in the provincial capital to promote it. Nurseries have also been established in Wuchuan, Fengzhen, and Jining to promote it widely. Afforestation is divided into memorial forests, people's self-made forests, and canal bank afforestation. Every year, about 200 trees survive. In terms of water conservancy, Suiyuan occupies the upper reaches of the Yellow River. The so-called "The Yellow River is only rich in a complete set," and the importance of water conservancy can be seen. The government-run major canals are: Yongji, Fengji, Huangtuolahei River, Yangjia River, Sha River, Yi River, Changji, Tongji, Tabu, and Gangji, each 150 li long. The Wujia River meanders for hundreds of li, with a drainage area of 300,000 hectares, which can be the largest water conservancy area. However, the project is huge and the financial resources are limited, so it cannot be completed. If millions of dollars can be invested in construction, the benefits will be immeasurable. In addition, there are no fewer than 200 canals opened by the people themselves, all suffering from economic problems and not fully completed. The Sanhu River in Baotou, the Minsheng Canal in Saxian, and the Dahei River in Guisui Satok, are each 200 li long. The water conservancy areas are all vast and the soil is fertile. However, the disadvantage is that they are not completed and the population is too small to develop, which is also a major reason. In addition to water conservancy, wells are also being dug in other counties. If they can be completed in turn, Suiyuan can be spared the worry of drought.</p>

<p>Shantou Correspondence: Red bandits in Jiangxi Province have gathered in the mountains on the Jiangxi-Fujian border, in counties such as Jianning, Taining, Shicheng, Gucheng, Changting, Huichang, and Ruijin, almost becoming a nest of red bandits. The red bandits in Jianning once attempted to attack Shunchang and Jiangle on the 10th, but were met and repelled by the two divisions of Fan Songfu and Sun Yuanliang, and retreated back to Jianning. At the same time, the 20th and 24th Red Divisions of the Changting red bandits attempted to attack the Eastern Route Army's front lines in Dalongyan, Daxiaochi, Xinquan, and Miaoqian from the Baisha direction, but were defeated by the two divisions of Liu Kan and Li Yannian, killing one Red Army chief of staff and one regimental commander, wiping out hundreds of bandits, and seizing more than 100 guns. The Ruixing Independent 3rd Regiment of bandits in Changting attacked the fortifications outside Wuping City and the Guangdong Army's Yan Yingyu Brigade from Guikeng Maocun Dashuikeng on the 7th and 8th of this month. After fierce fighting all day, the bandit soldiers were defeated and retreated back to Guikeng. Guikeng is located at the foot of Junmenling in Jiangxi Province, with a precipitous terrain. On the evening of the 10th, the Tahengzhong Regiment of the Yan Brigade led troops to pursue them through the night. They arrived at Guikeng on the morning of the 11th and immediately launched a fierce attack on the bandit fortifications. After several hours of fierce fighting, more than a dozen cannons were fired, destroying the bandit blockhouses and earthen forts. The bandits could not resist and retreated again. In the afternoon, Li's regiment estimated the situation in Guikeng, disarmed the bandits, killed dozens of bandits, and captured many bandit leaders. Huang Renhuan, the commander of the Fujian-Guangdong-Jiangxi border defense, telegraphed the good news, saying, "Guikeng connects to Junmenling in Jiangxi Province, and has again become a channel for the bandit army's transportation. I have ordered the Li Tahengzhong Regiment of the Second Brigade to encircle and suppress them, and on the 11th, they were recaptured. The bandits were bombarded and retreated and disarmed. It is estimated that dozens of bandits were killed in this battle, and the bandit leaders Pan Lianchang, Guo Jianfa, Liu Huanglin, and the heads of the pseudo-Soviet district government, Zeng Changfu and Liu Changni, as well as the female political commissar, Yezhumu, and 67 others, were captured alive. Seventy-two rifles were seized, and twenty-two hostages were rescued. Our army also suffered injuries: the 8th company commander, Li Dekun, and two soldiers were injured," etc. On the Xunwu front, the Guangdong Army's Huang Yanzhen Division was stationed in Chengjiangwei, and Huang Zhiwen's Division was stationed on the front line at Pangulin Pass. On the 7th and 8th, the red bandit Ye Jianying once led the most elite model regiment to attack, but they were all repelled by the Guangdong Army. Qiu Fucheng, the commander of the 22nd Regiment, was the most courageous. In the Battle of Furongzhang, he was shot through the head by a bullet and carried back to Zhongshan Hospital in Xingning for treatment. Li Yangjing set up a bandit suppression headquarters in Jipiao, on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border, and telegraphed Guangzhou to request the addition of air force assistance for the suppression. On the Shanghang Lufeng front, on the 11th, about 500 members of the pseudo-independent regiment arrived from Changting. The Guangdong Army's Chen Zhang Brigade, along with Zhong Shaokui's department in Fengrenshi, went to suppress them. They met the bandits upon arriving at Taiba, and after two hours of fierce fighting, the bandits fled in defeat, killing more than 50 bandits, seizing more than 30 guns, and capturing more than 20 bandits. The Guangdong Army has had small contacts with the bandits in the Fujian-Jiangxi border area, and each battle has been an attempt by the bandits to break through. It is heard that the two divisions of Yu Mo's department, Li and Ye, plan to move out from Xinfeng and Anyuan to attack the rear of Huichang Junmenling. (April 14)</p>

<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Military Commission has now divided Fujian into three major regions: bandit areas, near-bandit areas, and rear non-bandit areas. In addition to the counties currently in the hands of the bandits, such as Changting, Liancheng, Qingliu, Ninghua, and Jianning, Yanping belongs to Nanping. The counties of Jian'ou, Jianyang, Jiangle, Changsha, Yongan, Guihua, Shaowu, and Guangze belong to the Northern Fujian Bandit Suppression Army's garrison. Longyan, Yongding, Xiping, Ningyang, Shanghang, and Wuping belong to the Western Fujian Bandit Suppression Army's garrison. The coastal rear areas of Minhai, Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Zhangzhou, comprising 36 counties, are divided into two garrison districts: one is the Fuzhou Garrison District, commanded by the 87th Division Commander; the other is the Quanzhou Garrison District, commanded by the 36th Division Commander, Song Xilian. The 87th Division garrisons 14 counties in the Minhai Road area, and the 36th Division garrisons 22 counties in the Quanzhou Road area and the Zhangzhou area of Tanlong Road. These two divisions have also been transferred by the Military Commission to the command of the Provincial Chairman. Currently, the 36th Division has stationed the Li Liangrong unit of the 106th Brigade in the Quanzhou and Xiamen areas, and the Fu Zhenggui unit of the 108th Brigade in the Zhangzhou area. The Fu Brigade moved from Tong'an and Anxi to Zhangzhou on the 14th and 15th. Because Song's division has a wide area to defend, it has stationed the Peng Tang, Chen Yucai, Chen Peiyu, and Lin Jing security regiments in the Xing and Quanzhou counties, and Ma Hongxing and Chen Kun in Zhangpu and Wei'an in the Zhangzhou area. The powers of the two garrison commanders are quite large. All the garrison troops, security branches, public security bureaus, and military police in the area are under their command. The following is a record of the organizational regulations of the Fuzhou and Quanzhou Garrison Commands, which were promulgated in Quanzhou on the 14th: Article 1: In order to pacify the region, suppress bandits and communists, and carry out post-disaster reconstruction in Fujian Province, the Fuzhou and Quanzhou Garrison Commands are specially established in accordance with the regulations of the Military Commission of the National Government. Article 2: The Garrison Commander is subordinate to the Military Commission of the National Government and is subject to the command and control of the Chairman of the Provincial Government. Article 3: When the Garrison Commander is concurrently held by the commander of the garrison troops, the staff of the headquarters shall be concurrently held by the original officers of the commander. Article 4: The division of the garrison areas is stipulated as follows: Fuzhou Garrison Area: Minhou, Minqing, Gutian, Pingnan, Fuqing, Changle, Yongtai, Lianjiang, Luoyuan, Ningde, Fu'an, Xiapu, Fuding, and Shouning, a total of fourteen counties. Quanzhou Garrison Area: Putian, Xianyou, Hui'an, Jinjiang, Nan'an, Tong'an, Dehua, Yongchun, Anxi, Datian, Kinmen, Siming, Hua'an, Changtai, Nanjing, Longxi, Haicheng, Zhangpu, Yunxiao, Pinghe, Dongshan, and Zhao'an, a total of twenty-two counties. Article 5: The Garrison Commander is responsible for pacifying the region, investigating and arresting reactionary traitors, eliminating bandit troubles, maintaining order and transportation, and rectifying military discipline and morals. Article 6: The Garrison Commander has the power to command the security branches, public security bureaus, military police, and garrison troops in the garrison area. Article 7: The counties in the garrison area shall be subject to the command of the Garrison Commander in matters of rural reconstruction and bandit suppression. Article 8: During martial law, the Garrison Commander shall exercise his powers in accordance with the regulations of the martial law regulations. If it is considered that the local situation requires the implementation of a certain provision of martial law, it may be submitted for approval. Article 9: The Garrison Commander shall, according to the severity of the circumstances, submit reports to the Provincial Chairman or notify the Security Department at any time regarding the handling of pacification, rural reconstruction, and post-disaster reconstruction matters.

<h3 id="e119">The Three Provinces of Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi are Preparing to Repair the Mahua Dike The Issue of Land Allocation for Earthwork Has Not Been Resolved The Anhui Construction Department Sends Personnel to Xunyang to Discuss <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The Mahua Dike, which is related to the water conservancy of seven counties in the three provinces of Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, still has many unfinished projects after the Jiangxi-Jiangxi Engineering Bureau was abolished. Last autumn, the Anhui Construction Department repeatedly requested the National Economic Commission to allocate funds for continued repairs, which was ordered to be handled by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, and the provinces of Jiangxi and Anhui were ordered to send personnel to handle it together. Subsequently, after the three provinces sent personnel to Wuhan to discuss the results, the project was divided proportionally by the three provinces as usual. Bidding was used for dangerous locations, which was undertaken by Hubei Province, and minor conscription was undertaken by Anhui and Jiangxi provinces. Then, the Anhui Construction Department sent Dong Xiaoshu and Li Shuqing, the supervising committee members of the first section of the Jiang dike, to rush to conscript workers together with Susong and Wangjiang counties, and jointly undertake the earthwork task of 117,000 square feet that should be undertaken with Jiangxi Province. Recently, the Construction Department approved the West Water Conservancy Bureau's telegram urging to send personnel to Xunyang to discuss the repair of the Mahua Dike. The engineering of the dike is divided into four sections. The National Economic Commission had previously assigned the entire first section, part of the second section, and the entire earth ox section to Jiangxi and Anhui provinces, and the rest to Hubei Province. However, it is not clear whether the amount of earthwork that Jiangxi and Anhui provinces should undertake according to their share, and the previous division methods agreed upon by Jiangxi and Anhui provinces, are appropriate, and how Hubei and Jiangxi provinces will carry out construction. In order to facilitate progress, the Water Conservancy Section Chief Qi Qun of the department was specially dispatched to Jiujiang to first reach an agreement with the personnel of Jiangxi Province, and to contact the Mahua Dike Engineering Office set up in Jiujiang by the Jiang-Mongolian Engineering Bureau. The Construction Department, according to the report from Wang Weicheng, the Magistrate of Wangjiang County, arrived at Fuxing Town (under Susong County) a few days ago, and Dong Li and the two committees, as well as Magistrate Li of Susong, discussed the allocation of earthwork for the dike, and held a meeting to discuss. Because the local gentry of Susong and Wang counties had different opinions and disputes were fierce, there was no good solution after half a day of discussion. The magistrates of Susong and Wang counties were also telegraphed separately yesterday, ordering them to quickly levy workers and handle the matter, and to carefully guide the local gentry concerned to work hard to assist, so that the problem of land allocation for the dike can be resolved as soon as possible.

<h3 id="e120">Jiangsu Construction Department Plans to Undertake the Jiangnan Seawall Project Selects the Best Construction Teams, with an Estimated Cost of 520,000 Yuan Appoints the Project Director, and Construction Can Begin Next Month <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Regarding the Jiangnan seawall project, from Changshu through Taicang, Baoshan, Chuansha, Nanhui, Fengxian, Songjiang, and Jinshan, etc., it connects with the seawall in the Pinghu County area of Zhejiang Province. It is more than 500 miles long and is the guarantee of the population's lives and property in the coastal counties. The seawalls in the territory of the four counties of Baotai Changsong, etc., are adjacent to the river and the sea, and are battered by wind and tides every day, which is especially dangerous. During the typhoon in August of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the losses were huge. In the 21st year, post-disaster reconstruction projects were launched, but due to limited funding, only part of the originally estimated project was completed. Last September, it suffered repeated risks again. Not only was the old work becoming more and more dilapidated, but also the new work in the 21st year was mostly damaged. Shen Baixian, the Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, personally went to investigate and dispatched personnel to estimate the cost, and prepared a plan to carry out the reconstruction project, which was estimated to require 1.2 million yuan, in order to engage in construction. However, due to the empty treasury, there was no ability to raise funds, so he had to request assistance from the central government. He then received an order from the Executive Yuan, informing him that he had sent a letter to the National Economic Commission to plan and handle the matter. Shi Dejing, a member of the committee, inquired about how much the province could raise on its own. This project can be roughly divided into three types: urgent, important, and ordinary. Except for the ordinary projects that can be delayed slightly, the urgent and important parts must be carried out at present, and the cost is estimated to be more than 1,017,000 yuan. The province can only reluctantly raise 400,000 yuan, and the shortfall is requested to be subsidized by the Economic Commission. Unexpectedly, the reply from the Economic Commission last month stated that this year's construction funds have been exhausted and cannot be taken into account. However, the time is pressing, and it is really impossible to delay the implementation. The Construction Department then plans to select the best construction teams in the absence of a solution, and the scope is temporarily set at 520,000 yuan. All implementation engineering cost budgets, and the organizational regulations of the Seawall Engineering Office, as well as the regular cost budget of the Engineering Office, have been submitted to the 643rd and 646th meetings of the Provincial Government Committee for deliberation and approval. It is now actively preparing for implementation, and construction can begin around the middle of next month.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that Shen Baixian, the Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, specially appointed Peng Yumo, the Director of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Road, as the Project Director of the Jiangnan Seawall Project. His plan is to first estimate and measure the sea area and set up sectional engineering offices. Each section will have a guiding project director and several engineers. It is said that after Peng Jun was appointed, he will start to organize the engineering office and prepare to carry out the construction policy. (April 20)</p>
<h3 id="e121">Songjiang: Two Kidnapping Cases in the Large Town of South Pudong <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Bandit alarms have been frequently heard in the various townships of this county recently. What is reported in the newspapers is almost daily. However, the usually peaceful Tinglin Town in South Pudong has now also been heard of being robbed and kidnapping people. It has been investigated that at the late Gu Yeyu's house in the Eastern Market Xiatang of Tinglin, on the midnight of the other day (18th), four or so bandits suddenly trespassed. They climbed over the fence and entered the inner room from behind the house. First, they forced the women of the Gu family to hand over the keys, robbed them of two or three hundred yuan in cash, a pair of gold bracelets, two pearl flowers, and three rings. Then, they kidnapped two nieces of the Gu family, one named Wang Jiezhen and the other named Yao Huiguan. At that time, the servant of the Gu family had already managed to sneak out and report to the Public Security Sub-bureau. The bureau only sent police officers Lu Ziyu, Wang Fengshan, Zhao Baoming, and Zhang Yingcai to rush to the scene. However, the bandits were carrying the hostages and carrying the stolen goods out of the back door and heading south. Under the light of the electric torch, it was clear at a glance that the bandits were all on foot. The victim immediately urged the police officers to chase and rescue the hostages, but they were all afraid to move forward. They instead ordered the victim to notify the security corps. Therefore, the bandits calmly escaped. Local people were extremely indignant after the incident. In such a major case, the Sub-bureau Chief Yang Meilin and the Patrol Chief Pan Xuecheng did not personally lead the police to the scene. Furthermore, the police officers who were sent were all afraid of the bandits and watched as the hostages were taken away by the bandits. Their dereliction of duty cannot be excused. Therefore, they have proceeded to jointly submit a request for their dismissal.</p>

<p>Wang Jinqing and Pin Yun's family in Gaojia Village, Eighteenth Ward of Fengjing, were suddenly visited by seven bandits on the night of the 17th.

<p>Fan Jiazeng, a farmer in Tapingtou Village, eight li away from Zhangpu Town, was a man of modest wealth and was targeted by bandits. Last night, in the middle of the night, a bandit boat arrived at the location, with seven or eight bandits on board, armed with guns, both long and short. After landing, they swarmed into Fan's house and ransacked it for an hour. Before leaving, they kidnapped Fan Jiazeng, his son A Da, and his nephew Ruzhou, took them to the boat, fired a volley of shots to show their power, and sailed towards Shuangyangtan Lake and escaped. Afterwards, Wei Renzheng, the Chief of the Public Security Sub-bureau in charge, led police and security corps members to pursue, but the bandits had already sailed far away. He immediately reported to the General Bureau and then to the County Government, and ordered a strict search for the bandits to rescue the hostages from danger.</p>

<p>Wang Jinming, Hao Quezi, and other notorious bandits from Xiaoxian in this province, have repeatedly committed crimes in that county and have long been sought after without success. The county government recently learned that the bandits had fled to Changshu and sent three police detectives, Zhu Wenrui, etc., with official documents to track them to Changshu and request the assistance of the county's Detective Team. On the morning of the 18th, it was learned from an informant that the bandits Wang Jinming, etc., were indeed in the Nanfang Hostel outside the South Gate. Zhu Shunqing, the Captain of the Detective Team here, immediately sent Detective Xie Desheng, leading five detectives, together with the police detectives from Xiaoxian, to go to the scene. In Room 15 of the hostel, they arrested the three bandits, Hao Quezi, Wang Jinming, and Wang Xiaofa, and brought them to the county for interrogation. Remaining News After the Fire at Zanghai Temple</p>
<p>Zanghai Temple in Gaofeng, West Yu Mountain, caught fire unintentionally on the 17th of this month, destroying more than ten rooms and causing huge losses. It is now learned that the number of incense burners who died in the fire that day was not just two people. On the 18th, three more bodies were found, identified as Zhang Guisheng, twelve years old, Zhang Xing, thirty-two years old, and Zhang Xiang, sixty-five years old, all of whom were temporary workers at the temple. The monks of the temple originally planned to ask the county magistrate to come for an inspection, but the families of the deceased specially went to the county to request an exemption from inspection, which was approved by the county. Cheng Genlin, Zhang Shenglin, and others who were burned have severe injuries and are still receiving treatment in the hospital. It is heard that in this fire, a jade seal given by Emperor Shunzhi of the former Qing Dynasty was also damaged and broken.</p>

<p>Villagers from Chengsi Township in Xinta District of the county were staging a Huaguxi opera when Chen Chunpu, the chief of the Public Security Bureau of the district, believing the opera violated numerous prohibitions, dispatched a patrol leader and four police officers to the village to stop it. Unexpectedly, the villagers refused to comply and surrounded the police. One officer escaped to report to the bureau. Chief Chen then led two police officers, together with a platoon leader and four soldiers from the Sixth District Security Corps, to the village. The villagers, upon seeing the police, beat gongs to gather a crowd, assaulted the officers, destroyed the patrol boat, and tied up Chief Chen, taking him to Lú lú. The Sixth District Office was notified by phone and detained five villagers and one agricultural boat involved in the kidnapping of Chief Chen. They also telegraphed the county government, requesting the Public Security Bureau and the water patrol to assist in strictly apprehending the instigators for prosecution.</p>

<p>The Construction Department of this province has issued an order stating that the city and rural telephone systems in this county, which use iron wire for communication, suffer from weak signals over long distances, making it difficult to communicate effectively. Therefore, officials have been sent to nationalize the systems for improvement. The county government submitted the matter to the district chiefs' meeting for discussion, and the following was resolved: (1) The Sujia main-line long-distance telephone system will be handled in accordance with the order (excluding the switchboard). (2) The city and rural telephone systems were originally funded by local contributions. Since the government is taking over, those funds should be returned.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Wuxi: German Anthisen Commits Suicide While Touring Wuxi <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Anthisen, a German employee of the Zhongye Company at No. 6 Central Road, Shanghai, in his forties, arrived in Wuxi by train on the 10th of this month to enjoy the spring scenery. Dressed in a khaki-colored Western suit and carrying a large bag, he walked to the Gongyun Bridge and, standing beside the Sixth Bridge, attempted to hire a boat to tour Taihu Lake. However, Anthisen did not speak Chinese, and although he gestured and pointed, the boatmen did not understand him. Jin Pinshi, who runs the Guangming Eye Hospital near the Huinong Bridge in the city, and who was an acquaintance of Anthisen, happened to be passing by and saw Anthisen trying to hire a boat. He approached Anthisen and accompanied him to Meiyuan and Yuantouzhu for sightseeing. That evening, Anthisen asked to temporarily stay at the Yuantouzhu Taihu Villa. Jin returned to the city. For several days, Anthisen invited Jin to tour the lake and mountains, showing great enthusiasm. On the morning of the 18th, Anthisen was still sound asleep at 10 a.m. The waiter there was very surprised and knocked on the door, but received no answer. However, he could hear loud snoring. He pushed the door open and found Anthisen’s face pale and unconscious, realizing he had taken poison. He immediately reported to Wang Xinru, the owner of the villa, who rushed Anthisen to Puren Hospital in the South Gate for treatment. Dr. Li diagnosed it as poisoning, with a critical condition and little hope of survival. He is currently in Ward B, Room 2 of the hospital. A long-distance call was made to Hua Ke, the acting president of St. John's University in Shanghai, notifying Zhongye Company and reporting to the German Consulate in Shanghai, who informed Anthisen's wife to come to Wuxi to handle matters. After receiving the news, Anthisen's wife and her ten-year-old child took a train to Wuxi to inquire about his condition at Puren Hospital. In Anthisen's suitcase, they found three empty bottles of tranquilizers, a handgun, and nine bullets. The reason for Anthisen's suicide is extremely strange. It is said that he led a romantic and eccentric life and had attempted suicide twice before. Once, he shot himself in his residence with a handgun, and another time he jumped into the Huangpu River in Shanghai, but he was rescued both times.</p>

<p>Lu Ronglin, the owner of a boat sailing from Changzhou, Jiangsu, to Sian Village, Changxing, Zhejiang, was transporting thirteen large pieces of cloth from Hongchang, destined for various shops in Zhejiang, and one large piece of cloth from Tongtaiheng, destined for Sian Village, Zhejiang. After loading these in Changzhou, the boat proceeded to Wuxi where it loaded additional miscellaneous goods. Setting sail from Wuxi, the boat reached Daxikou, but encountered strong winds. After waiting until the 17th, when the wind subsided slightly, the boat sailed again until it reached the vicinity of Jiaoshan in Taihu Lake. Suddenly, a fishing boat approached from the east, forcing the boat to lower its sails and stop. Nine robbers, armed with guns, knives, and sticks, jumped onto the boat, robbed it, and beat the boat owner and crew, stripping them of their clothes. They then loaded all fourteen large pieces of cloth, as well as miscellaneous goods, bedding, and clothing onto the fishing boat and left. The loss is estimated at over two thousand yuan. Afterwards, the boat returned to Wuxi and then to Changzhou, where the boat owner filed a report with the two county governments. Yesterday (the 19th), he also telegraphed the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, requesting them to order the water police to conduct strict searches and to order all patrol ships to patrol the lake one or two times daily, to quell the lake bandits and reassure merchants.</p>

<p>Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government arrived in Shanghai by overnight train from Nanjing at 7:20 a.m. yesterday. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Security Chief Yang Hu, and Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen were all present at the North Station to greet him. Armed soldiers and police closely guarded the station's surroundings. The Public Security Bureau's military band also played music at the station. Chairman Lin arrived in the private car attached to the Nanjing-Shanghai overnight train. After arriving at the station, Mayor Wu was the first to board the train to pay his respects. They then disembarked together. Lin, still wearing a blue cloth robe, a black cloth mandarin jacket, and a black woolen cloak, was in high spirits. He walked out of the platform amidst the uplifting sounds of military music, and rode with Mayor Wu in Wu's car directly back to his residence on Father Jin Road for rest. On the train, Lin told reporters that he came to Shanghai to take care of private matters and to seek treatment for his old ailment from national physician Lu Zhong'an. He had no other mission. He would stay in Shanghai for one or two days and then return to Nanjing. When asked about issues such as the opening of railways and postal services in North China and foreign affairs, Lin declined to comment, only saying that his opinion was the same as that of the Chinese people. Yesterday morning, Land Bureau Chief Jin Liren and others paid their respects. In the afternoon, Lin went out to visit friends, returning to his residence late in the evening.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Jiangsu Construction Department Actively Preparing for Seawall Construction Project: Construction to Begin Around Mid-Next Month <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Seawall stretches from Changshu, through Taicang, Baoshan, Chuansha, Nanhui, Fengxian, Songjiang, and to Jinshan, connecting with the seawall in Pinghu County, Zhejiang, for over 500 li, providing protection for the lives and property of the coastal counties. The seawalls within the borders of Baoshan, Taicang, Changshu, and Songjiang counties, bordering the river and sea, are particularly vulnerable to wind and tides and are therefore the most dangerous. In August of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), they suffered severe damage from a major storm surge, resulting in significant losses. In the 21st year of the Republic (1932), post-disaster reconstruction work was carried out, but due to limited funds, only part of the original project was completed. In September of last year, they were repeatedly exposed to risks, and not only did the old works become more dilapidated, but the new works from the 21st year of the Republic were also largely damaged. Shen Baixian, the Director of the Construction Department, upon taking office in October of last year, recognized the importance of the seawalls and personally conducted inspections, sending personnel to survey and estimate the project, proposing a comprehensive plan for reconstruction, estimating a need of 1.2 million yuan to carry out the repairs. However, due to empty coffers, the department was unable to raise the funds and had no choice but to request assistance from the central government. The Executive Yuan then issued an order informing the department that the request had been forwarded to the National Economic Commission for planning and implementation. The Economic Commission then inquired as to how much the province could raise on its own. Considering this project, the department divided it into three categories: urgent, important, and ordinary. Except for the ordinary projects, which could be delayed, the urgent and important parts were projects that must be undertaken immediately, requiring a total of 1,017,000 yuan. The province could only manage to raise 400,000 yuan, and requested the Economic Commission to subsidize the shortfall. However, last month, the Economic Commission replied that the funds for this year's construction had already been allocated and could not be diverted. Given the urgency, delaying the project was no longer an option. Therefore, the Construction Department, finding no other way, decided to prioritize the most critical sections, limiting the scope to 520,000 yuan. The implementation plan, project cost budget, and the organizational regulations and operating budget of the Seawall Engineering Office have been successively approved by the Provincial Government Committee at its 643rd and 646th meetings. Currently, preparations are actively underway, and construction is expected to begin around the middle of next month.</p>

<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, Shen Liangmu, the editor of the Batavia Times in the Dutch East Indies, has returned to China for inspection. After learning of this, a reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency visited him yesterday afternoon to inquire about the situation of the overseas Chinese. Shen has resided in Southeast Asia for a long time and has served as an editor at the Singapore Nanyang Siang Pau and the Chief Editor of the General News, and is familiar with the conditions in British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. A summary of Shen's conversation is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e145">Long History of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>According to Shen, what the Chinese call "Southeast Asia" refers to Siam (an independent country), Annam (French colony), Burma (British colony), Borneo (divided between British and Dutch), Straits Settlements (British colony), Malaya (British colony), the East Indies (Dutch colony), and the Philippines (American colony). Most of these are islands, hence the name "Southeast Asian Archipelago." Approximately 6.5 million overseas Chinese reside there. The history of migration dates back to before the Song and Ming dynasties, with approximately 700 years of documented history. The Southeast Asian Archipelago is located in the tropics, with a climate that is summer-like year-round, and the land is fertile, yielding abundant produce. The most notable products include Siamese rice, Javanese sugar, Malayan rubber and pineapple, coconut, sago flour, potato flour, corn, tobacco, bananas, coffee, and various fruits. The most notable minerals are tin and iron in the Malay Peninsula and oil in the Dutch East Indies. The natives of the Southeast Asian Archipelago are mostly of the Malay race, with brown skin, devout Muslims, very low intelligence, and a lazy disposition, lacking the ability to save. Ten years ago, when the prices of local products were high, those who went to Southeast Asia almost always became wealthy. The Chinese are diligent, frugal, and hardworking, and are far more intelligent than the natives. At that time, Southeast Asia could truly be called "paved with gold." People from Fujian and Guangdong, after saving a small amount of travel expenses, could arrive in Southeast Asia penniless and first work as coolies. After acquiring some capital, they would become small vendors and merchants. Within a few years, they could leap to become wealthy merchants. Therefore, most of the wealthy merchants in Southeast Asia today come from humble backgrounds, and some are even illiterate.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Current Predicament: Japanese Goods Dumped on the Market <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>However, as world events shifted, since 1927, the entire world has suffered an economic recession, and all kinds of production have experienced a surplus. The prices of local products in Southeast Asia have also plummeted. For example, rubber has fallen from over 200 yuan per picul to over 20 yuan, rice has fallen from over 30 yuan per picul to over 2 yuan, sugar has fallen from over 70 yuan per picul to over 4 yuan, and other prices, such as the price of tin, have also fallen sharply, almost beyond repair. The falling prices of local products have made it difficult for the natives to make a living, and they have no surplus funds to spend. As a result, the various businesses run by overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have been greatly affected. Countless businesses have closed down and gone bankrupt. Those who were once as wealthy as royalty are now impoverished. For example, the Chen Jiageng Company, which was once famous throughout the world, has recently closed down for liquidation. The rest can be imagined. However, while falling prices of local products are a major cause of the economic distress in Southeast Asia, another reason is the dumping of Japanese goods on the market. The Japanese have two plans for expanding their national power: the "Northern Advance Policy" and the "Southern Advance Policy." The Northern Advance Policy involves seizing our Northeastern Provinces and Inner and Outer Mongolia. The Southern Advance Policy aims to dominate Southeast Asia. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese forcibly occupied our Northeastern Provinces and Jehol. The so-called "Northern Advance Policy" has achieved considerable success. The Japanese, having gained an inch, are also actively pursuing the Southern Advance Policy. Although the political power in the Southeast Asian Archipelago belongs to countries such as Britain, the Netherlands, France, and the United States, due to historical reasons, the economic power is largely in the hands of our overseas Chinese. The Japanese are afraid of clashing with the great powers regarding the Southern Advance Policy, so they purely adopt a policy of economic aggression. Taking advantage of the underdeveloped industries in Southeast Asia and the high prices of European and American goods, which are not suitable for the natives to purchase, they ship large quantities of Japanese goods to Southeast Asia and dump them on the market, so that almost the entire market has been occupied. Although countries such as Britain and the Netherlands are urgently seeking to resist this trend and have repeatedly increased import taxes, the Japanese merchants have the financial strength of the state as their backing, so they are ultimately unable to do anything. Even Western stores in Southeast Asia are now selling Japanese goods. He (Shen) once went to a Western store in Java to shop and saw that most of the items displayed in the store were Japanese goods. When he asked the manager why they were selling Japanese goods, the manager replied, "To make them available for the natives to buy." This shows how successful the Japanese dumping policy has been. According to those familiar with the commercial situation, Western stores that sell purely European and American goods rarely do not lose money, so they have no choice but to mix in Japanese goods to maintain their business.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Fundamental Shake-up in the Status of Chinese Merchants <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Almost all of the Chinese merchants in Southeast Asia are "intermediaries" (i.e., they collect agricultural and mineral products from the natives and sell them to foreign firms, or transport them themselves for export, and then resell foreign industrial products to the natives, standing between the natives and foreigners, hence the term "intermediary"). If Chinese merchants do not promote the sale of Japanese goods shipped to Southeast Asia, the sales cannot be widespread. In the past, when Sino-Japanese relations deteriorated, Chinese merchants, motivated by patriotism, refused to buy or sell Japanese goods, and the Japanese suffered significant losses. After being dealt these blows, the Japanese have now devised ways to counter them. He once went to the interior of Malaya and Java to inspect the situation and found that even in remote rural areas, there are now Japanese shops. They do not rely on the Chinese and sell goods directly to the natives, and the prices they sell at are often lower than the wholesale prices offered to Chinese merchants, so the natives are happy to buy from them. The Japanese stores are always crowded with customers, with phonograph music playing. If this continues, the "intermediary" status of our overseas Chinese will be completely taken over by the Japanese. At the same time, the Japanese are also using various manipulative tactics to win the favor of the natives, inviting intelligent natives to visit Japan for sightseeing and giving them special treatment, so that they return and spread praise of the Japanese, secretly spreading seeds of rejection of Westerners and Chinese. A newspaper run by a native in Java is already publishing pro-Japanese articles, such as saying, "The Chinese come to Southeast Asia empty-handed, and when they return, they are always laden with goods, all of which belong to us natives. It would be better if the Japanese exchanged goods for our money." This shows the effectiveness of the Japanese propaganda work.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Urgent Rescue Measures: Promote Domestic Goods <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>He (Shen) has served in the newspaper industry in Southeast Asia. In his spare time, he often travels to various places to inspect carefully. He deeply feels that the current situation is a matter of life and death for the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. The shops and factories run by overseas Chinese have continued to close down, and the number of unemployed overseas Chinese is increasing. If they all return to China, the position of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia will be fundamentally shaken. Moreover, at a time when the rural economy in the country is bankrupt, if these millions of unemployed people return to the country one after another, it will only make the domestic economy more difficult. As for how to save the overseas Chinese from their predicament, this is a very big question that cannot be answered in a few words. The fundamental solution still depends on the strength of our country. But the urgent rescue measures include doing our best to promote domestic goods in Southeast Asia. For this matter, he has been speaking out in various newspapers in Southeast Asia for several years, advocating and promoting with all his efforts. At present, there has been some promotion of domestic goods in Singapore and other places, but in the vast markets of the Malayan interior and the Dutch East Indies, domestic goods are still as rare as phoenix feathers. Patriotic overseas Chinese want to buy domestic goods but cannot find them. As for the reason why domestic goods cannot develop in Southeast Asia, on the one hand, it is due to the dumping of Japanese goods, but on the other hand, it is also due to the ignorance of the Southeast Asian situation by those in the country who operate domestic goods businesses, and their failure to plan for development. If the central government can come up with an overall plan to support them, and if the state provides a strong backing for those things that people cannot do on their own, such as expanding shipping routes so that domestic goods are transported to Southeast Asia by domestic merchant ships at low freight rates, then the cost will naturally be lighter and they will be able to compete with Japanese goods. Secondly, if the central bank subsidizes merchants in the country who operate domestic goods businesses, so that they can do their best to promote sales overseas without having to worry about "capital turnover," etc. (detailed plans will be published in another article later), then people will be happy to operate in Southeast Asia, and overseas Chinese will naturally be happy to use domestic goods. The dumping of Japanese goods can also be resisted to some extent.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Overseas Chinese Yearn for the Motherland to Rescue Them <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Although his return to China for inspection is of a personal nature, before leaving, he was earnestly entrusted by overseas Chinese from all walks of life to report the situation overseas and the difficulties currently faced by the overseas Chinese to the central government and the compatriots in the country, so that they can find ways to rescue them. Therefore, he feels that this trip is a very important responsibility. If there are any questions from compatriots in the country, he dares not fail to answer them to the best of his ability. At present, overseas Chinese are very willing to cooperate closely with the industrial and financial sectors of the country to make efforts to open up a path that will benefit both sides. In the face of the current dangerous situation, if compatriots at home and abroad do not respond to each other, not only will there be no hope for the rapid development of our country's industry and commerce, but after another 50 years, it is feared that there will be no place for overseas Chinese to stand in Southeast Asia. Now the Three Northeastern Provinces and Inner Mongolia have been occupied by the enemy. If we lose the foundation that our ancestors have laid in Southeast Asia with their blood and sweat over hundreds of years, then not only will we not be able to obtain the remittances from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, which can make up for a portion of the trade deficit, but the surplus population in the southern provinces will also have no way to be discharged. What a dismal future it is to imagine! For the sake of reviving our nation and promoting our industry and commerce, it is hoped that compatriots in the country and government authorities will pay close attention to and assist the current situation of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia has extremely abundant and extremely cheap raw materials that can be used by our country to manufacture commodities. Southeast Asia has an extremely vast and extremely good market that can be used for the promotion of our country's manufactured goods. Please do not let this opportunity slip away. Shen said this and looked tired due to the fatigue of the journey, so the reporter took his leave. It is said that Shen will stay in Shanghai for a few days and then go to Nanjing to report to the central government.</p>

<p>Huadong News Agency reported that American aviator Mr. Hawk, accompanied by Mr. Paley, a representative of the United Continental Aviation Corporation, was performing a flight in Nanchang with a Condor aircraft. Because his assistant forgot to lower the landing gear when the plane was landing, the plane was damaged and had to be repaired before it could be used. Mr. Paley has already returned to Shanghai. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e152">Nanchang Flight <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Hawk made a flight in Nanchang on Tuesday. In addition to Hawk and Paley's assistant, Gus, there were also Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's pilot, Smith, and eight other flying instructors, all of whom were on board the aircraft. At the same time, he carried 2,800 pounds of gasoline and 1,000 pounds of bombs (without explosives) to take off and perform.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Performance Situation <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Before the flight, Hawk gave a speech and, to demonstrate the characteristics of the aircraft, used only one pusher engine during ascent (there were originally two pusher engines). After reaching the sky, both pusher engines were used simultaneously. At the fastest flying rate, the pusher engine could rotate as many as 2,200 times per minute. During the flight, Hawk also changed the inclination of the pusher engine, suddenly slowing down during rapid driving, to demonstrate his driving technique.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Landing Damage <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>However, when the plane was landing, it was piloted by his assistant, Mr. Gus. When the plane landed, he forgot to lower the two wheels, causing the belly of the plane to hit the ground, breaking both wheels. The pusher engine was also bent and disassembled due to touching the ground. The two bomb hooks hanging 1,000 magnetic pounds of bombs were also broken. Fortunately, the fuselage was strong and did not capsize at the time, so everyone was safe. The bombs carried did not cause disaster because they had no explosives. On the same day, Hawk borrowed two Douglas pusher engines for temporary installation and flew back to Hangzhou for repairs. The damaged pusher engine has now been telegraphed to the United States for speedy transport to China for replacement. Paley returned to Shanghai on an aviation school plane the night before, and Hawk himself is scheduled to return to Shanghai today.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Fellow Townsmen from Songjiang in Shanghai Sent a Telegram to the Provincial Chairman Regarding the Dredging of the River <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Fellow townsmen from Songjiang in Shanghai, regarding the dredging of the Songjiang River, Magistrate Jin disregards the people's strength and falsely reports wages, specially telegraphed to Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government, the text reads: "Chairman Chen, Provincial Government of Zhenjiang: In the past, all dredging of the river in our Songjiang was carried out at the end of the year and the beginning of spring, taking advantage of the agricultural slack season, dividing the city river into sections and employing farmers and workers in each county to contract for earthwork, at a price of no more than five or six cents per English square foot. This time, the dredging has been delayed for a long time and has not started. As agricultural work is about to begin, the bidding was only started. All local contractors who have always contracted have stopped. There must be other reasons. All three bidders are from other provinces. The Taichang Gravel Company, which won the bid, has no dredging experience. It has temporarily recruited thousands of workers from other provinces, all a mob of vagrants, creating an unprecedented bad precedent for dredging in the hinterland. The public is horrified. The foremen of the company are not like an army that can be controlled by military law, and the police force in the county seat is very thin, making it difficult to suppress. If an accident occurs, who will be responsible? The listed budget also sets up clever names, with the price per English square foot nominally at four cents, but in fact, additional fees are added for difficult work, long distances, and transportation, calculating the price per English square foot to be one yuan, eight cents, and four li, which is twice as much as the wages when rice was expensive in the past. The riverbed in the city river has always had a lot of rubble, so there is no so-called difficult work. The mud disposal points are all houses on both sides, so there is no need for long distances. Since long distances are required, there is no need for ships to transport. It is heard that the technical director, Xu Mojia, has had contacts with the company early on, and people are talking about it, so the inside story is conceivable. The government has clearly ordered that the dredging of the river should be based on on-site employment as a principle. Even if contracting is required, consideration should be given to rural bankruptcy, and farmers and workers should be employed during the agricultural slack season to provide relief. Migrant vagrants have higher costs for boats, food, and lodging. If each section is not properly taken care of, it is easy to cause trouble, disturbing the residents and further alienating the locals. If there are abuses such as stealing, deducting, and falsely reporting, the citizens have no way to supervise. The total amount of this river project in the old cases of the sixth and fourteenth years was only 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. This time, it is falsely wasting 60,000 yuan. Regardless of the government's financial difficulties and inability to raise funds, the citizens have no strength to bear it in this time of poverty. Moreover, local security is of utmost importance. The citizens are deeply concerned and feel obligated to speak out. In addition to separately telegraphing to the county government, we specially telegraph to the Chairman to inspect and quickly order the Magistrate of Songjiang County to take responsibility for refusing migrant workers, protect the order of the city and countryside, and, at the same time, check the budget and earthwork according to the old cases and make substantial reductions to maintain security and avoid abuses. This is a virtuous act." Songjiang Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai sincerely asks. Yun-jian Fellow Townsmen Association replies to Songjiang Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai: "To all gentlemen of the Songjiang Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai: We have received your telegram. Regarding the dredging of the city river in Songjiang County this time, your association has strongly opposed the listed budget and the recruitment of migrant workers. We deeply admire your sincerity in loving and protecting your hometown and speaking out for justice. Our association members express their deepest sympathy. In addition to writing to Magistrate Jin to adopt and implement your suggestions, we hereby reply." Gu Jiaxuan, Standing Committee Member of the Executive Committee of the Yun-jian Fellow Townsmen Association, bows.</p>

<p>Tiqiao, Chenxing, Tangkou, and three towns under the jurisdiction of the fifth district of Shanghai County in Pudong are located between Shanghai and Nanhui counties, with developed transportation and thriving commerce. Previously, the district chief, Xing Zhigang, considering that telephone service is an important plan for developing local public utilities, raised funds and submitted a request to the county government to appoint technicians to survey the route and implement the plan to facilitate progress. Workers were hired to start work on the 15th of this month, and it is expected that each town will be able to communicate by the end of next month. However, there is still a section of the Center River Town in the third district of Nanhui County adjacent to the fifth district, which is about one mile long and is a disputed area between Shanghai and Nanhui counties, which has not been connected for a while. The District Chief Shen of the third district of Nanhui County is currently being consulted to find a way to connect it. After the connection, it can directly reach the Sanlintang Town and Yangsiqiao Town in the city area, and it will not be long before it can communicate with the entire city of Shanghai.</p>

<p>China National Aviation Corporation convened a board meeting at 5 pm yesterday. The Chinese directors Huang Jiangquan, Dai Enji, Chen Qijun, and American directors Prinn and Bender attended. (According to the company's directors, there are seven in total. Wang Xianhua, a Chinese director, has died of illness, and Picksbay, an American director, has returned to his country and has not yet come to China.) Chairman Huang Jiangquan presided over the meeting. Dai Enji reported on the company's business overview and the loss of the 17th Sikorsky aircraft and the damage to the 40th Sikorsky aircraft on the Shanghai-Guangzhou route, which resulted in the suspension of the Shanghai-Guangzhou route for ten days. It was immediately resolved to purchase two Moke-Dao aircraft for the Shanghai-Guangzhou route, four Fokker aircraft for the Shanghai-Chengdu route, and two Lockheed aircraft for the Beijing-Ping route. Many other proposals were also discussed and the meeting adjourned at around 6 pm. It is heard that each Fokker and Lockheed aircraft is worth about US$50,000, can accommodate two pilots and ten passengers, and can travel at 180 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Increase in the Number of Members: The original number of committee members was set at nine. Due to a request from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to increase the number of members, it was temporarily decided to increase it to eleven. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Shipping Association each recommended one more member. Therefore, the inauguration meeting originally scheduled for yesterday was also changed to a discussion meeting.</p>

<p>Wu Tiecheng, the chief captain of the solicitation team of the Chinese Aviation Association, in order to actively enrich the aviation patriotic movement, convened a city-wide hotel industry conference at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to discuss the collection of aviation donations from the hotel industry. It was passed at the conference to collect 5% and it was scheduled to begin collecting on the 15th of this month. According to news from the office of the solicitation team of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, there are more than 1,300 large and small hotels in the city, two-thirds of which are located in the concession. Unexpectedly, when the collection of hotel industry donations was recently started, the Shanghai Municipal Council interfered, saying that this violated the Yangjingbang Regulations and could not be enforced. If it is voluntary, it can be ignored. If so, the association's wish to raise 200,000 yuan and purchase hotel industry aircraft within June has suddenly encountered obstacles. Therefore, the association immediately reported to the municipal government, requesting that a protest be filed with the Shanghai Municipal Council as soon as possible to facilitate progress.</p>

<p>The Brussels World's Fair is scheduled to be held in Brussels next April. The Belgian authorities have invited our country to participate in the grand event. However, due to financial difficulties, our country has submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan and decided not to participate. According to an investigation by a Xin-Xin News Agency reporter, the Shanghai Products Association for the Chicago Exposition believes that Brussels is the center of European admiration and that the exposition is the hub of international trade competition. At a time when trade between China and Belgium is increasing, it is necessary to promote our country's products. The association therefore proposed a discussion at the plenary meeting of the board of directors the other day. It was decided to cooperate with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to prepare for participation under the guidance and assistance of the government, organize the Belgian Exposition Products Association, and engage in preparatory work. It is also heard that the land designated for the exhibition halls of various countries at the Brussels Exposition is completely free, and the exhibition building materials can be manufactured in China and transported to Belgium for installation to save expenses.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Private Aviation Participating in Joint Transportation Plans to Establish a Joint Transportation Management Office. Nine Shipping Companies Nominate Five Members to Establish an Office as Soon as Possible <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Private shipping companies participating in aquatic product joint transportation are based on the shipping routes, warehouses, and docks owned by various shipping companies before November 1933 by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications. Those with shipping routes but no docks and warehouses are not eligible to participate in joint transportation. Therefore, only the following nine private shipping companies have been approved to participate in joint transportation: Sanbei, Zhengji, Ningshao, Dazhen, Hongan, Huxing, Daxing, Hezong, and Dada. These nine companies all have docks and warehouses and meet the requirements. Among them, Sanbei, Hongan, and Ningshao can participate in the Wuchang Road, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Road, and Pinghan Road. Hezong and Dazhen can participate in the Longhai Road. Among the nine companies, Sanbei and Zhengji have the most ships. In addition, Huxing, Daxing, Dada, and other ships all operate on the Tongyang, Ruiping, and other ports. The participation of the nine companies in joint transportation has been approved by the Ministry. A meeting was specially convened. The result was that the joint transportation cooperative office must be established first before it can manage the dispatch of ships for transportation on various routes. It was agreed on the spot that the nine companies should first send representatives to establish a preparatory committee for private aviation joint transportation to prepare for establishment in a short period of time, and Chen Bogang, Cao Zijia, and Mr. Yang, Mr. Li, and others were publicly elected to be responsible for the preparation. Except for one committee member who will be given travel expenses, the rest are voluntary. All documents and secretaries will be temporarily staffed by personnel from the Shipping Association and given a small allowance. The preparation expenses will be shared by the nine companies and divided into three categories: A, B, and C. The fee for Grade A is 500 yuan, the fee for Grade B is 300 yuan, and the fee for Grade C is 150 yuan. The nine companies have unanimously agreed to the above-mentioned agreed methods and have notified each company to pay the preparation fee first. The five preparation members are actively proceeding.</p>

<p>The stevedores of various Jardine Matheson shipping company ships demanded that the company change the year-end double salary to a three-day monthly wage increase in November last year, which led to a general strike. On November 5, both parties signed an agreement to increase the monthly wage by three days and abolish the double salary. After the dispute was resolved, all ships have been handled in accordance with the regulations, but the Dingsheng and Lisheng wheels have not been handled in accordance with the regulations, which has caused dissatisfaction among the workers on the two wheels. At 10 am yesterday, all 40 stevedores on the Beiyang class Dingsheng wheel, because the company's handling was improper, although they had repeatedly requested it to no avail, immediately went on a full slowdown to deal with it. The Shanghai branch of the Seamen's Union learned about this and, together with all the Jardine Matheson stevedores, sent cadres to mediate. The company's manager promised to handle it in accordance with the regulations. All wage increases after November 15 last year will be increased by three days per month in accordance with the signed agreement. Those before November 15 will still be handled according to the annual monthly office. The two resumed work at around 11 am.</p>

<h3 id="e168">The Tianjin Fresh Goods Brokerage Tax Disturbance Resolved. Shanghai Business Representatives Returned to Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday. A Provisional Solution Was First Set and Then Submitted to the Central Government <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Shipments to Tianjin of Fresh Goods Will Be Notified for Loading Today</p>
<p>Tianjin City previously caused a disturbance by collecting fresh goods brokerage tax. The Shanghai Fruit and Local Products Association specially sent representatives Xu Yunqing, Cai Runsen, and Xu Runsheng to Tianjin for negotiations. They returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday and convened a general meeting to report on the negotiation process. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tax Collection Process: After the Tianjin Municipal Government approved the new contractor Chen Xisan to contract for the fresh goods brokerage tax, it started operations in February, setting up offices and employing more than 20 brokerage officials to intercept and inspect along the way and collect a 3% brokerage tax based on the price. They even confiscated goods for auction and detained people for fines. The format and inspection methods of the tax bills of the Finance Bureau were similar to those of the Likin, and the government did not correct them, which led to a suspension of transportation. The stalemate lasted for several months, and Japanese goods monopolized the market, affecting freight transportation from Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Ouzhou, and causing great damage. Negotiation Process: The Shanghai fresh goods business representatives were assisted by directors Huang Jinrong and Du Yuesheng, and Tianjin gentlemen Pan Zixin and Wang Wendian, Standing Committee Member of the Chamber of Commerce, and went to Tianjin for negotiations. Fortunately, they obtained the understanding of the government and signed a provisional solution with the new contractor to reduce the losses of the merchants and were allowed to revoke the order to investigate and arrest fresh goods merchants. The content stated that the goods of merchants from the South transporting to Tianjin for sale would temporarily pay a deposit, which would be saved in a bank designated by both parties, pending the Central Government's ruling on whether the brokerage tax was legal to determine whether to pay or not (excluding brokerage firms). Submitting to the Central Government: This negotiation cannot be considered over because it has not achieved the goal of cancellation. It is still necessary to appeal to the Central Government to correct the situation. The transitional measures have been signed and the public has decided to notify the merchants in each port to start business immediately to avoid losses from suspension of transportation.</p>

The Tenants Request Assistance from All Walks of Life <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>There are nine houses near Fushou University on Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession, Dapuqiao. Seven families are tenants. It is the property of Pan Shiyi, an architect of the Gongzheng Real Estate Company. Because the original rent was high after the house was built, the tenants asked for a reduction. The owner entrusted lawyer Zha Renwei to reply that the rent reduction could be discussed. Just as the tenants were about to go to negotiate, the owner suddenly transferred the lease management rights to the China Jianye Real Estate Company, which was actually a strategy to not allow rent reduction. However, the tenants did not stop asking for rent reduction because of the transfer of the lease management rights by the owner, so they continued to ask for rent reduction and stopped paying the rent uniformly until it was resolved. Therefore, there were arrears of rent for seven or eight months and as few as five or six months. Unexpectedly, the new landlord sued the tenants for not paying the rent according to the law and delayed the time. In order to punish one as a warning to all, he suddenly sent Chinese and Russian personnel and doormen and guards to A-character 420, the Beauty Laundry Company, at around 11 am yesterday to first implement forced door sealing. The tenants witnessed the situation and were all indignant. The whole body gathered at the 7th District Branch of the 2nd Special District Citizen's Association at 5 pm and requested that measures be taken to stop it. The cadre of the association immediately convened a meeting of the tenants to discuss countermeasures. It was decided that the person who was sealed should report the situation to the French patrol room by themselves, and the whole body of tenants should publicly hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit in accordance with the law, and the association should send letters to all walks of life and the superior Party and government organs to request that justice be upheld and assistance be given. All the tenants were satisfied and dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Zhabei Public Bus Workers Went on Strike Yesterday Morning and Resumed Work in the Afternoon; Labor and Company Jointly Petitioned the Municipal Government, Presenting Six Demands for Arresting the Culprits and Guaranteeing Safety; The Mayor Promised to Strictly Punish the Soldiers Who Committed the Assault <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Drivers and ticket sellers of the China Merchants Public Bus Company had a conflict with security team soldiers and police officers from the 3rd squadron of the police corps the night before, due to free rides. Four workers were severely injured in the beating, causing outrage among all workers. Workers on Route 4, which operates in the downtown area, announced a strike yesterday morning and petitioned Mayor Wu to severely punish the perpetrators. After representatives from the party and government agencies, along with union representatives, persuaded them, they resumed work and traffic at 3 p.m. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Announcement of Strike: China Merchants Public Bus Company vehicles on all routes, as usual, left the factory at 6 a.m. every day to operate. However, after the incident the night before in which soldiers beat and injured workers, all workers were unwilling to work due to lack of job security. Therefore, starting yesterday morning, they implemented a strike. After repeated persuasion by union representatives such as Fan Yifeng, Routes 1 and 3 started to leave the factory at 7 a.m., while all the workers on Route 4 drove the vehicles out of the factory gate and parked them along the Baoshan Road railway in a sequential manner. As the matter had not been resolved, the workers insisted on the strike, all wearing uniforms and sitting quietly on the buses, maintaining order.</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government: After the Route 4 workers announced the strike, the 6th District Public Bus Union, fearing the situation would escalate, specially dispatched directors Fan Yifeng and Mao Xinhui, together with the company's general manager Huang Zhongwen, to the downtown area at 11 a.m. yesterday to petition Mayor Wu, demanding severe punishment for the perpetrators. As yesterday was the regular meeting of the Municipal Affairs Conference, Mayor Wu sent Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, to receive them on his behalf. First, Dai Zhen reported the circumstances of the incident and presented the case for severely punishing the perpetrators. Director Xu then expressed that the municipal government would be responsible for compensating the company for its business losses and the workers for medical expenses. The municipal government would strictly investigate and punish the perpetrators, and starting immediately, one police officer would be assigned to each bus for protection, hoping that the representatives would persuade the workers to return to work. The representatives were satisfied and returned.</p>
<p>Strict Investigation by the Authorities: At about 1 p.m. yesterday, Fan Guoren from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Sun Jiaqian from the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, Zhu Guilin from the Social Affairs Bureau, Wen Hongen, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Wang Chengzhi, Section Chief of the Municipal Security Office, Chen Zhuomin, Commander of the 1st Regiment, and Mei Xueyan, Commander of the 3rd Battalion, drove to the entrance of the 2nd Sub-station in the 7th District on Qimei Road to investigate the truth of the incident. The injured driver, Zhu Agen, reported the circumstances of the soldiers and police officers beating and insulting him without reason, and pointed out the bloodstains on the ground. The representatives inspected the area for a week and then went straight to the Yue Min Hospital on Dixiwei Road to慰問the injured workers.</p>
<p>Condition of the Injuries: A reporter from Dagongshe went to Yue Min Hospital yesterday to investigate the condition of the injured workers, as follows: (1) Huang Riguang, a timekeeper, suffered a concussion and was mentally confused. His injuries were the most severe. According to the doctor, if his fever increases, his life may be in danger. (2) Zhang Shanlun, a ticket inspector, had his right thumb broken. (3) Zhu Agen, a machine operator, injured his waist and buttocks. His condition was relatively mild. (4) Wang Shuyun, a ticket seller, had relatively minor injuries.</p>
<p>Demanded Conditions: Based on the decision of all the workers, the union put forward seven demands to the party and government agencies: (1) Dismiss and investigate Pei, the captain of the 3rd squadron of the police. (2) Guarantee the lives of the injured (bear full responsibility for disability or death). (3) Be responsible for all medical expenses and losses. (4) Effectively guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future. (5) Investigate the perpetrators. (6) The above items must be answered within five days.</p>
<p>Director's Persuasion: Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to show responsibility for punishing the perpetrators and to reassure all the workers, specially persuaded the workers in front of the company, saying, "The unfortunate incident that happened yesterday, brothers, we are jointly maintaining local治安security. We pay great attention to this unfortunate incident, and Mayor Wu is also very concerned. However, the development of the downtown area puts emphasis on transportation. You are all transportation service personnel and should value society and the country. I hope you will resume work immediately. There will never be similar incidents in the future. On the part of the Public Security Bureau, the party has ordered the police to protect the buses."</p>
<p>Route 4 Resumes Operation: All the workers on Route 4, which operates in the downtown area, believed that the authorities had accepted the articles for punishing the perpetrators, and after being persuaded by representatives from the party and government agencies and the union, they resumed operation at 3:10 p.m. It is found that this incident caused the company a loss of about 400 to 500 yuan in terms of business, and other losses are not yet included.</p>
<p>Union's Statement: According to Fan Yifeng, executive director of the 6th District Public Bus Union, at 5 p.m. on the 19th, a conflict occurred between a security team soldier who did not buy a ticket and the ticket seller. After the two sides explained the misunderstanding, the肇事 soldiers were taken away by the captain and detained. Unexpectedly, at about 7 p.m., more than 20 burly men, all in plain clothes, surrounded the vehicles in front of the 2nd Sub-station in the 7th District and brutally beat the drivers. The workers who were injured and fled into the station were prevented by the gatekeepers. The worker Zhu Agen grabbed two of the perpetrators and sent them to the 3rd squadron of the police stationed in the station for detention, but the captain released them. This situation shows that they are colluding with each other, and those who are responsible for security are actually committing violence, which is appalling. The workers announced a strike because their jobs were not guaranteed. Although they have temporarily resumed work after being persuaded by the party and government, if there are no satisfactory results, all will still strike to achieve effective safety guarantees.</p>
<p>Union's Report: The 6th District Public Bus Union yesterday separately reported to the party and government agencies and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, saying, "Regarding the report, Zhu Agen, Wang Shuyun, and other members of the属會 reported that at about 7 p.m. on the 19th of this month, the last bus returning from the municipal government on Route 4 of the China Merchants Public Bus Company, when passing the entrance of the 2nd Sub-station of the Public Security Bureau in Songhu Road, was suddenly surrounded by fifty or sixty thugs from nowhere, carrying military刺刀and other weapons, beating and injuring the members, causing bloodshed and a dangerous situation, while those in charge of public security at that place turned a blind eye, causing the perpetrators to escape without success. This situation clearly indicates an organized action, requesting that it be forwarded to higher authorities for effective security, etc. Based on this, the属會派 dispatched members to investigate in detail, and the matter is confirmed. Yesterday's situation was already rumored, and now it has become a reality. The lives of our workers have lost their security, causing traffic to be disrupted (Route 4). Although the属會 persuaded them, the members' fear is heavy, and it is ultimately ineffective. The brewing of the incident did not happen in just one day. The biggest reason is that the police officers of the 3rd squadron stationed on Songhu Road lack discipline. Our members have been insulted by them many times, often using假戒嚴事態, checking vehicles, and making it a tool for causing trouble for the staff, resulting in delays in the schedule. Other various situations cannot be fully described in writing. There have been several disputes in the past. All public security agencies should be responsible for security. As a result, it has all become泡影. If we continue to敷衍事, the future will be unimaginable. The属會 considers the report to be of great importance, so this morning (20th), it dispatched members together with the company authorities to go to the municipal government. Director Xu of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau 代蒙seen,允蒙 promised to be responsible for punishing and taking on the losses. In the afternoon, Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau personally came to investigate, persuaded the workers, and accepted the workers' demands, and then restored the current situation. However, this is only a preliminary solution. The workers' demands still懇求you轉咨the Public Security Bureau to handle them as soon as possible to stabilize public opinion and value human life, which would be德便,谨呈."</p>

<p>Wu Yunliang, a native of Hunan, 25 years old, used to be a sergeant in the 19th Route Army. In the Battle of Songhu against Japan, Wu had a brave spirit and always went forward in every battle. Therefore, he was shot in the chest and almost died. Fortunately, he was carefully treated at the Ye Lu Hospital inside Dananmen in Shanghai, and he was able to recover. Therefore, Wu felt that the director was like his re-created parents, and the director also valued the martyr as a close friend. They became close friends with each other. Then he went to Fujian with the army, but before long, the warlords叛變, and the historical heroics were destroyed. In great sadness, Wu left the army and came to Shanghai. Disheartened with the army, he deposited 100 yuan of savings in Ye Lu Hospital and acted as a杂务. However, the hero hated the chaos of national affairs, his ambitions were difficult to achieve, and he felt very sad. He suddenly had a short-sighted thought and wrote a绝命书the day before yesterday, sending it to Liang Baoguang, a superior officer who ran a Yuhe Shoe Store in Guangzhou. The content was purely to hate the warlords, mutual slaughter, and the urgency of foreign insults, and the country would perish one day, so he committed suicide. He had been treated kindly by Ye Lu, and he was afraid that future generations would misunderstand. Regarding the virtue of Liang and Ye Lu, he often wanted to repay them in the next life after the age of eighteen, etc. He placed the letter in front of and behind the bed and then swallowed opium and committed suicide. When the hospital discovered it, it was too late to save him and he died. He reported to the 3rd Sub-station in the 1st District, and the landlord reported to the local court. Prosecutor Liu announced the investigation and the investigator verified it. The money was taken from the deposit and Ye Lu Hospital 收斂the body, waiting for family members to claim it.</p>

<p>Russian adventurers Lai Weisiqi, Lao Mai Zhufu, and Baobaofu, etc., falsely claimed to be French Deputy Consul, Chief Patrol Officer of the French Police, and Head of Detective Squad, etc., conspiring with Si Dui Na Fa, La Gu Di Ya Fa, and La Di Mier, etc., defrauded the Chinese Xu Haidu and Fan Gongru of money under the pretext of allowing them to set up a gambling den, and took 3,000 yuan of ocean silver in advance. After the French Police discovered this, they arrested Lai and the other four and sent them to the 2nd Special District Local Court to be prosecuted for the crime of impersonating government officials and fraud. The details of the interrogation were previously reported. Yesterday was the date of the fourth continued hearing. At 11 a.m., Judge Sun Pengxian ascended to the 8th Criminal Court to continue the hearing. Lawyer Yuan Jiahuan appeared in court on behalf of the police, and the defense lawyers Wei Wei and Shen Di Gu Fu, who were hired by the defendants, also arrived in court to await instructions. The judge first interrogated the defendant Si Dui Na Fa, who admitted that he had received 2,000 yuan of ocean silver from Xu Haidu, part of which was used to apply for a target practice permit, and part was used for living expenses. "All the bases are, I don't know English. After they wrote it, they asked me to sign it," etc. His lawyer Shen Di Gu Fu presented a license previously obtained to the court. The judge then asked La Yu Di Ya Fa, "What are the roulette gambling tools taken from your home used for? Did they use this to defraud people?" La replied, "Si Dui Na Fa asked me to do it. It is a circle used for target practice and is not a roulette gambling tool. I don't know that they wanted to use it for fraud." At this point, the court ordered the witnesses Xu Haidu and Fan Gongru to be summoned for questioning. Xu was still represented by lawyer Li 　Sen, who said that Xu was still ill and could not come to court, and that there was a prescription to prove it, and then presented the prescription to the court. Fan did not arrive. The judge then asked another witness, the police interpreter Qian Chenglong, "You said last time that you had something to add. You can say it today." Qian said that what he wanted to add was that Lai Weisiqi said to me personally at the Deng Tuo Mo Hotel that he was Boluai, and did not mention that it was a cigarette term. I asked him to write the three characters Boluai on paper, and this paper is now stapled in the file as evidence. I still thought Lai was a real Boluai. I also asked him where to meet when sending money in the future. He replied, "Go to the French Consulate and ask for Boluai." The judge then asked Lai about the 15 two characters written by Lai in the receipt, "Is it a number or a date?" Lai replied, "It is the date of starting business." The judge then asked, "What is the explanation for writing 'Ai Mu' below?" Lai replied, "I don't know French." The judge then explained to him, "When the top and bottom are connected, it is the number of 15,000." Lai had no words to answer. The judge then asked the defendant Baofu, "Are you impersonating the French Police Detective Captain?" He replied, "No. I have known Xu Haidu for three years. How can I impersonate?" The witness Pan Jielu was not summoned and was ordered to結保first. According to the供, "My father is a Filipino from Little Luzon, and my mother is Chinese. I am now a Chinese national and live at No. 18 Hede Road. This happened at 10 a.m. on March 28. Fan Gongru came to my house with an invitation card, saying that he was co-hosting a business with the French and that the French Consul General Patrol Officer and Detective Captain would be present. He asked me to be the translator. Because I don't understand French, I invited Mr. Qian Chenglong, an interpreter in the French Police, to be the substitute translator," etc. At this point, it was past noon. The court adjourned the hearing to the 27th because the witnesses were not complete. The代理lawyers of Si Dui Na Fa and La Gu Di Ya Fa requested permission for the two defendants Si and La to be released on bail. The judge then ruled that Si Dui Na Fa would pay a保證金of 3,000 yuan and a隨傳隨到鋪保, and La would 交隨傳隨到妥保候示. The other defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Gu Cuizhen, the daughter of Yongren Gu Zhang, and her mother, of Lin Yin Lane, Lin Yin Road, Ximen, jointly accused Li Xizhi, a teacher at Shangde School, of raping a female student. After the检察官 of the local court, based on the allegations of the accuser, determined that her age was 17, not yet having a birthday, it was considered the crime of raping a young girl under the age of 16 and filed a public prosecution. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Shao審理the case in the 5th court. The accuser hired lawyer Liu Xiang to附帶private prosecution, that is, Gu Cuizhen brought 47 yuan from home as expenses for the旅館合歡. Li Xizhi hired lawyer Wang Shouan, etc., for defense,搜查反證, saying that the girl was naturally浪性and that Xizhi was遭圖需索不遂,含血噴人,移花接木嫁祸, etc. During the审问问官严密detailed questions were asked in the middle because if Gu Cuizhen was蹂躏for the first time, there would be a different situation. However, since the answers were related to风化,旁听was prohibited and the court was closed to讯 all the煩屑situations. The plaintiffs also claimed that Li Xizhi was introduced to their daughter by the female student Xia Beilei. When the judge asked Xia, she said that she knew Li Xizhi through Gu Cuizhen's introduction, so it was completely opposite. When the judge asked the defendant Li Xizhi, he absolutely denied it, claiming that if he had拐诱at that time, why would he引导Gu Zhang to seek a student? Moreover, Ren Jiaxiang, a young man who was also混一處together, was also accused in the 2nd District Police Station. It can be seen that there was no goal at that time,择肥而噬etc. At the same time, his defense lawyer复辩claimed that Gu Cuizhen went to the旅館by herself and that the 客單on the循环簿was in her own handwriting and she had written 18 years old twice, so it was impossible to 強云was not yet 16 years old, and no one拐诱her. At this point, the问官asked Gu Zhang if she wanted財物金錢or附帶民訴, and she answered, "I don't want money, I just want to辦人." So she withdrew the private prosecution and the judge advised lawyer Liu to leave the court according to law, and then questioned each of the witnesses in detail. It was finished at noon. As the circumstances of the case still needed further investigation, it was ordered that after verifying the situation of both parties, summons would be issued for a continued hearing. Then he retired from the court.</p>

<p>The organizational motive of the market is based on the fact that the number of foreign cotton纱布imported into our country every year is the largest. Foreigners also rely on unequal treaties and use strong economic power to set up factories all over the country, engaging in dumping. The cotton纱布factories run by Chinese people self相倾軋, so that the market price cannot be stabilized and domestic cotton fabrics are difficult to promote. In the suburbs of Shanghai, manual weaving is the means of livelihood. The raw materials used are mostly foreign goods. In order to挽回利权 and maintain the livelihood of weaving families, the market has this organization.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Preparation Process <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>

At that time, during the 폐历year-end, in order to调剂 the finances of weaving families, we began to收布with cash, and built a new-style market in Jiyi Lane, Tianjin Road. In February, the market was completed, the interior was also布置妥帖, the basic weaving families had 2,000 部fabric weaving machines, and contracts were signed separately. The fabric from the weaving families that has been陆续collected has reached more than 200,000 yuan, and the sales of domestic yarns have exceeded 150,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Business Plan <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The business plan of the market is to专以收买various cotton fabric from各機户. In accordance with the quality of the materials organization, regulatory prices, to seven 成issue domestic yarn and three 成issue现欵, a side will be 收各goods, in accordance with the original price, wholesale to the port帮客 word number, deeply hope that各纱厂can reduce prices, in order to popularize the promotion, the revitalization of the cotton fabric business.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Future Facilities <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The market will gradually build facilities in the future, according to the highest principle of modern social economic organization, control family cotton fabric industry, in order to achieve product improvement, quality unification, supply and demand equivalent, so that weaving households livelihood, can be in stability to求发展, social economy, on the 调剂prosperous, for a planned economic struggle, to挽　回利权also.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Products Company, located across from the Hong Miao Temple on Nanjing Road, is the earliest established stronghold in this city for promoting national products and resisting foreign goods. Its spirit of hard work and struggle has always been praised by ladies and gentlemen in society. Now, to continue its efforts in promoting the Women's National Products Year, it has specially united with over 300 national product factories nationwide, dealing in silks and satins, cloth, knitwear, cotton textiles, steel, enamelware, leather goods, toys, incense, food, etc. Upholding the spirit of advocating national products, they are conducting an unprecedented large price reduction for 21 days. All goods are uniformly discounted and sold at low prices, sacrificing profits for the sake of widespread sales, striving to arouse all compatriots nationwide to uniformly wear and use national products.

<p>The Central National Medicine Institute has been established for three years, but due to financial difficulties and lack of talent, there have been few special achievements. Regarding the draft of the unified disease nomenclature, the original draft compiled by Zhang Ren was even opposed by a majority of Chinese medicine practitioners. This time, Chen Wujiu, the central director who promoted the establishment of the institute and drafted the declaration, has arrived in Beijing. President Jiao Yitang then discussed with Mr. Chen the organization of an editorial committee, appointing Mr. Chen, Huang Qian, Zhou Liuting, Sui Hanying, Guo Lingzhi, and others as committee members, and recommending Mr. Chen as chairman to take overall charge of its completion. Mr. Chen firmly declined but was unable to refuse. In the last month, two joint meetings were held in the latter half of the month, and there were some preliminary ideas. The scope of the editorial committee is originally to compile lectures, review teaching materials, and write books, which is already extremely heavy work. However, this time, they also need to draft a table of Chinese and Western disease names, which is even busier. In order to divide the work and cooperate, Chairman Chen intends to seek out medical doctors who are well-versed in both Chinese and Western medicine, such as Yu Wuyan and Zhang Zanchen, to jointly undertake the drafting. Mr. Chen is the only authoritative figure in the field of Chinese medicine literature. Now that the Chinese medicine regulations have been agreed upon and the institute is about to be reorganized, this effort to improve and perform cannot be said to be a piece of good news for the Chinese medicine academic community.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Municipal Council Plans to Purchase Land to Widen the Intersection of Nanjing Road and Henan Road <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the houses at No. 160 on the southeast corner of the intersection of Nanjing Road and Henan Road, a portion collapsed on March 20th of this year. According to a report from the Chief Engineer of the Municipal Council to the Works Committee, the Chief Engineer, after the incident occurred, notified the landowner that he intended to acquire the prescribed land to widen the road and requested that the amount of compensation be submitted. However, the landowner replied that he had no intention of selling the land but had already started repairing the houses. The Chief Engineer's intention is that before the landowner carries out large-scale repairs, the Municipal Council should seize this opportunity to consider the land acquisition plan. It is found that the land in question was purchased by the late Mr. Hardoon in 1919. In 1926, the bureau planned a widening project, and the area to be acquired was 1 mu, 2 fen, and 0.8 hao. However, after acquiring this land, it is necessary to acquire No. 162, the adjacent plot, according to the plan. Only then can the traffic on Nanjing Road be greatly improved. As for the existing houses there, although the structure is not good and in disrepair, it is not to the point where the entire building should be demolished. After discussion, the committee members agreed that the land at No. 160 should be acquired according to the plan so that there would be another opportunity to acquire the land in front of No. 162 and benefit from traffic improvements. Moreover, after No. 160 is acquired, it will already have a smoothing effect on westbound vehicles. The committee then suggested that the board of directors approved it on Thursday of this week, and the responsible personnel should proceed with the purchase of the land at the corner of the road in accordance with Article 6, Paragraph A of the Land Regulations (i.e., the Yangjingbang Regulations).</p>

<p>The Xinyifang houses on Xipushi Road in the French Concession, totaling 21 buildings, were suddenly notified by the landlord, Xiaji Company, in December of last year that the rent for street-facing houses would be increased by 20% and the rent for alley houses would be increased by 10%. After hearing the news, all the tenants considered that under the current economic downturn, a large rent increase was particularly inappropriate. Moreover, the original rent was expensive, and the tenants were in the process of</p>
<h3 id="e194">Demanding Rent Reduction <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>At that time, the landlord preemptively acted to prevent the tenants' rent reduction movement. All the tenants requested the 8th District Branch of the Municipal People's Union to issue an official letter to the landlord, demanding a 30% rent reduction for street-facing houses and a 20% rent reduction for alley houses. As a result, a dispute arose between the two parties. After each party brought in people to mediate, the principle of the landlord not increasing the rent and the tenants not reducing the rent was used to achieve a peaceful resolution. However, the landlord, Gu Xinqiao, firmly refused to agree and insisted on achieving the goal of increasing the rent, which led to the breakdown of the mediation. Now, the landlord has filed a lawsuit against the tenants in the Second Special District Court on the grounds that they owe rent, according to the increased amount. The court has already ruled that out of a total of nine households, two lost the lawsuit and seven won. The litigation costs are borne proportionally on average. However, because both parties have losers, they will both present reasons, supplement evidence, and appeal according to law. Furthermore, the tenants held the 10th representative meeting at the 8th District Branch of the Municipal People's Union in the Second Special District at 5:00 PM yesterday. More than 20 tenants attended, including Yu Heyin, Wu Yunqing, Wang Aicai, Zhou Qifang, etc. Representative Zhou Qifang was publicly elected as chairman to report on the purpose of the meeting and the court's</p>

<p>After discussion among the tenants, it was decided to take countermeasures: (1) For the two households, Wanxing and Wu Yunqing, who were induced by the landlord to collect the rent according to the increased amount, and now most people pay the original amount of rent, they should be treated fairly. Moreover, there are still several households who were deceived by the landlord to take away the goods, and then sent the rent receipts. After inspection, they realized that the increased amount was paid, so they did not recognize it beforehand. This kind of means of increasing rent should be criminally prosecuted and appealed separately, and legal counsel Wang Peiyuan should be asked to proceed according to law. It was decided to pass. (2) Regarding the rent issue, whether there is an increase or not, all will continue to be deposited in the bank. Passed. (3) Regarding the necessary expenses, it was decided to be borne by the public. For the above cases, it was decided to publicly invite Representative Zhou to go to Lawyer Wang's office with Mr. Wu Guowei to discuss proceeding according to law. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>

<p>Yang Bingxun, the inventor of Bingxun shorthand, lives at No. 29, Nangaoshou Lane, Haining Road. On the morning of the 13th of this month, Yang returned home from teaching at Jinan University and discovered that his tenant, Cai Jinghan from the East Sea, had improper behavior with his wife, which led to a dispute. Yang used his mouth to bite off a little of Cai Zhaonong's ear. After the Huishi patrol room was reported and ordered an investigation, a lawsuit was filed in the First Special District Court according to law. The court issued a summons, and Judge Zhan Liangce opened a criminal court to summon Yang. Lawyer Yan Luqing Da Yaoxian arrived in court. First, the patrol room lawyer Jiang Baoqi claimed that the patrol room filed a lawsuit for the crime of injury under Article 293 of the Criminal Law. The plaintiff rented a pavilion room from the defendant. On the evening of the 13th of this month, the defendant returned home from the outside and saw the plaintiff and his brother Cai Zhaozheng in his room, chatting and laughing with his wife. At that time, the defendant quarreled with his wife and then negotiated with the plaintiff. He went to the patrol room and was dismissed by the patrol chief and returned home. There was peace. Then, at 2:30 in the middle of the night, the defendant put on his clothes and went to the pavilion room and had a dispute with the plaintiff again. As a result, the plaintiff's ear was bitten off a little by the defendant. After reporting to the patrol room, he was sent to Renyi Hospital. He was indeed verified, and the investigation by the detectives at the house was also confirmed. That is why the lawsuit was filed. Then Cai Zhaonong voted that I am now a shorthand writer at the Economic Research Institute. I rely entirely on the sensitivity of my ears. Now that the defendant has injured me, whether there will be adverse effects in the future is still unknown. I should ask the defendant to compensate for all losses. The defendant's lawyer then claimed that the plaintiff and defendant were teachers and students. All the relatives and friends of both parties do not want to expand this unfortunate incident and are making every effort to mediate, and reconciliation is likely. It should be requested to postpone the hearing. In response to the defendant's confession, he is a professor at Jinan University. He usually stays at the school on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. On the 13th, he had important matters to go home. He usually enters and exits through the front door, but he suddenly entered through the back door and his footsteps were extremely light. The servants and others were all frightened. At this point, the court held that since the two parties were teachers and students, there was considerable emotion, and the defendant's actions were also due to anger. Since there are friends and friends to mediate, reconciliation is the best. Therefore, the case was adjourned for one week and the plaintiff was ordered to go to the forensic doctor's office to examine the injuries.</p>

<p>At 6:00 AM yesterday morning, after the workers at the Da Zhonghua Yingchang Match Factory in Lujiadu, Pudong, started work, the workers in the white powder room locked the door at 6:45 AM because they needed to go out for breakfast, leaving the room empty. It is unknown how, but a fire suddenly broke out. Because the white powder room is extremely flammable, there was a slight rumbling sound at first, followed by a louder sound. The staff in the factory quickly climbed onto the roof, opened the glass canopy, and poured fire extinguishing chemicals to put out the fire. Because the fire was fierce, they immediately opened the tap water and tried hard to pour water to extinguish it. However, the white powder contained phosphorus and was difficult to extinguish. After about half an hour of burning and countless water pouring, the flames were finally extinguished. There were nineteen barrels of white powder that had already been ground into powder, which were completely destroyed. The powder was prepared for the day's work, and the raw material loss made it impossible to配药, which affected all other departments, and there was no work to do. The factory immediately ordered all 800 male and female workers in the factory to stop working for one day.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Tobacco Exchange Association Sends Letter Requesting Return of Confiscated Matches <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai South Office of the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association sent a letter to Director Wang of the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau and Director Jin of the Shanghai Inspection Station yesterday, saying, "Dear Sirs, Recently, we received a report from our member, Taiyuanchang Tobacco Exchange Store on Lima Road, that our store had batches of Shuangshou matches purchased from Suzhou Zhongnan Match Company in November of the year before last. Because sales were sluggish, there were still ten tins that had been left for a long time. This month, we received a request from Qian Xingji Store in Jiaxing Pu Ruan to pack and sell them on consignment. They were delivered to the sailing ship on the 16th. Unexpectedly, the next day we received a postal card saying that there was no market for this product and there was no need to load it, so we immediately sent someone to pick it up. When it was inspected by the inspector of the Inspection Station, it was found that only one tin had a inspection stamp, one tin had a broken wrapping, and the flower inspection stamp could not be checked. The remaining eight tins had flower stamps. The staff seized two tins and issued a receipt. It has been found that the matches have indeed been taxed, but due to the age and damage, the flower stamps have fallen off, which is not tax evasion. We hereby report to your office and ask you to clarify to the tax office and retrieve them. Our office has sent staff to the store to investigate and found that the matches were indeed stagnant in sales, and have been left for a long time, and the packaging is broken, so there is a suspicion of tax evasion. We hereby issue a special letter of certification to report the previous situation and sincerely hope that your (Bureau) Director will check and return them and avoid further discussion. We will be sincerely grateful."</p>

<p>L&gt; Reading Questions and Answers &lt;L</p>
<h3 id="e210">Reading "Tears and Laughter" <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>I am a young man who loves to read novels, and because of my low level of education, I mostly read old novels.</p>
<p>After reading your "Reading Questions and Answers," I realized that the books I have been reading are completely harmful and useless. I am truly ashamed! If I were to ask myself: Why do you read novels? What have you learned from novels? I would have nothing to say.</p>
<p>I have now decided to follow the path you have shown me and read more new things that are relevant to my actual life. Old novels are for entertainment, they lead people to fantasize. New novels are stimulating, they guide people to delve into society. I now understand the general principle of this.</p>
<p>However, what remains a question in my mind is: "Why are these harmful old novels still popular for a time? Why do so many people go astray because of them? For example, "Tears and Laughter," in the current publishing industry, is still the most widely sold novel; is it because its content is rich? (Of course not.) Or is it because its technique is excellent? (Not necessarily.) According to your view, nothing in the world, even such a small thing, should be called accidental, right?</p>
<p>I hope you can give a correct critique of "Tears and Laughter" and similar readings. This, compared to you giving general opinions as before, will benefit readers more.</p>
<p>The question you have raised is exactly the question we are asking of our readers. From the discussion of general reading methods, to the specific exploration of a certain book or a certain question, this is originally a fixed procedure in our work, and we have already done so. Now, according to your opinion, let's make an investigation of "Tears and Laughter."</p>
<p>First, why has "Tears and Laughter" been so popular for a time? This question can never be explained by general vulgar people thinking that it is "skillful technique," or "accidental luck." We must find the root from the society from which it is produced, that is, what is its social basis? How does it cater to the tastes of the general readers?</p>
<p>"Tears and Laughter" is undoubtedly the work that can best express the complex and intricate Chinese society. (We cannot deny this point because of its content.) The development of Chinese society is extremely畸形. In Shanghai, we can see the towering three major companies adjacent to the quaint Red Temple, and the lightning-fast trams and cars on the same road as the one-wheeled carts. Reflected in people's minds, it becomes: those who advocate saving the country through science, at the same time advocating saving the country through chanting sutras, saving the country through Tai Chi, and those who enter and exit European dance halls, at the same time worshiping Buddha and praying to God. This kind of living style that appears at the same time but is vastly different is the social foundation of "Tears and Laughter."</p>

The last one or two points were seized by the West Team, which was a pity. (Please see the scores of each group.) We can only wait for the autumn. The results are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e227">From Dai Linjing and Lin Baohua: A Discussion on the Decline of National Spirit Among Our People <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— A Reader</p>
<p>This year's Far Eastern Games almost failed due to the issue of the participation of the puppet state. Fortunately, through the vigorous efforts of our country's representatives, the support of public opinion, and the fairness of the Philippine representatives, Japan's ambitions were thwarted, and the Games were able to proceed as scheduled. This is something we are very pleased about. However, during the preliminary selection process, several disappointing things were discovered. Among the most heartbreaking was the absence of soccer stars Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, Feng Yunyou, and others, as well as tennis star Lin Baohua.</p>
<p>It is said that Sun Jinshun's absence was due to the illness of his beloved wife and son. This situation is understandable. However, it is hoped that before the departure, if Mr. Sun's wife and children recover, the Physical Education Association will not adhere to the rules and regulations and will still select him.</p>
<p>As for Dai Linjing, everyone has long recognized him as China's best center forward. The position of center forward on the Chinese team was undoubtedly his. Unexpectedly, he lightly used the excuse that the National Goods Bank was moving as a reason to decline, saying he couldn't leave Shanghai. We believe this action demonstrates a lack of national consciousness and is a pity for Mr. Dai's glorious reputation.</p>
<p>Lin Baohua's absence is even more unacceptable. He actually said he couldn't bear to be separated from his beloved wife for too long, so he abandoned the great cause of winning glory for the country. This is absolutely wrong behavior, and public opinion should unite to urge and encourage him.</p>
<p>In short, we must realize that Chinese and Japanese are both yellow races, and their physical strength and intelligence are almost equal. The only reason why Japan is strong and China is weak is that the Japanese have a deep sense of national consciousness, while the Chinese have a weak sense of national consciousness. The Japanese are willing to sacrifice for the country, while the Chinese are only willing to sacrifice for money and women. How can we correct this weakness? However, in the end, we should also consider the athletes themselves. Life and sports are interconnected. Only under stable living conditions can they fully develop their talents and participate in sports to win glory for the country. Many athletes, because they cannot obtain stable living conditions and lack adequate assistance, have to abandon their ambitions to win glory for the country, which is a great pity. Of course, there are many people who are enthusiastic about this, and they should not be dismissed altogether. However, have our sports authorities and the general public paid attention to this point? No wonder the national spirit of athletes is declining to zero. This is a sigh in a deformed society.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Ministry of Education Orders Sixteen National Universities and Various Provinces and Cities to Consult and Organize Summer Training Classes for Middle School Science Teachers <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>The training period will be four weeks, starting from July 15th.</p>
<p>On the 20th, the Ministry of Education issued a circular to various provincial and municipal education departments, stating that the statistics on the results of the middle school student examinations in 1932 showed that the scores in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology were the worst. The reasons may be due to unsuitable teaching materials or poor teaching methods. Teachers must first strive to enrich and improve their knowledge of the content and methods of the subjects they teach in order to improve students' levels. This work should be carried out by the schools themselves, using whatever is most convenient and appropriate to their needs. The Ministry has given careful consideration to this and has now formulated a general outline of the measures for designated public and private universities to organize summer training classes for middle school science teachers, which is hereby issued for implementation. The education departments are instructed to consult with the designated nearby universities to organize the classes, or to carefully plan for them at other appropriate schools. Once the arrangements are finalized, the departments are instructed to promptly direct the middle schools under their jurisdiction to select one to four science teachers, and to submit their names, resumes, and subject areas in detail to the department. The department should then consolidate the number of people in the province who should participate in the training, allocate them to participate in the training, and report the planning and implementation details to the Ministry at any time for evaluation. In addition to separate orders to the universities concerned, a copy of the general outline is attached for reference.</p>
<p>The following fourteen universities (Nanjing Central University, Nankai University, Wuhan University, Beijing Normal University, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhejiang University, Jinling University, Jiaotong University, Datong University, Xiamen University, Shandong University, Guangxi University, Sichuan University, and Hunan University) are also hereby instructed, (Beijing Tsinghua University will be instructed separately), (details omitted above). The general outline of the measures for designated public and private universities to organize summer training classes for middle school science teachers is hereby issued for implementation. The universities should organize these training classes to the greatest extent possible in order to benefit secondary education, and should select current professors with expertise and experience in secondary education, or hire additional teachers, to serve as lecturers. In addition to separate orders to the provincial and municipal education departments to consult with nearby universities to organize the classes, a copy of the general outline is attached for reference. They are instructed to report the planning and implementation details to the Ministry at any time for review.</p>

<p>Jiang Jianren delivers a speech</p>
<p>Group meetings in the afternoon</p>
<p>The fifth session of the Zhejiang Provincial Local Education Guidance Conference continued yesterday (20th) as the second day. It was still held in the Zhejiang Education Hall on Pinghai Road, Hangzhou. More than a hundred representatives of various agencies and education staff attended. At 8:00 a.m., Jiang Jianren, the Director of Training at the Aviation School, was invited to give a speech entitled "The National Revival Movement and the Transformation of Education." He stated that in order to revive the Chinese nation, it is necessary to unify China and awaken national self-confidence, especially in transforming education. The failure of past education had three major flaws: (1) forgetting our roots, (2) education being too far removed from life, and (3) the commercialization of education. The way to correct this is to ensure that future education: (1) is national-based education, (2) is life-centered education, and (3) is responsibility-based education. He hoped that everyone would take responsibility. His words were extremely poignant and thorough. After the speech at 9:30, there was a five-minute break, and then group meetings were held. The following is a record of the first general meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e235">Change of Leadership Movement at Yixing Provincial Ceramic School <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu education authorities, in view of the long history and simple production of pottery in Yixing County, Jiangsu Province, and the need to promote it, established the Jiangsu Provincial Yixing Ceramic Vocational School in 1931 and selected Wang Shijie to serve as the principal. In the past three years, there have been no achievements, and Wang's personality is arrogant, arbitrary, and reckless, so that the local pottery industry is unwilling to cooperate. Recently, it was learned that the entire faculty and staff of the school, including Zhang Zongjie, Lu Baoqi, Zhang Zunian, Jia Zhenting, etc., witnessed the principal's willful behavior and notorious acts. For the sake of local industry and vocational education, they were unwilling to remain silent. They resolutely presented a report to the Provincial Government Education Department listing all the illegal and fraudulent activities, dereliction of duty, use of personal connections, oppression of apprentices, and unauthorized alteration of the school charter that the principal has committed since taking office. They requested that officials be sent to investigate and deal with the matter immediately. A representative was publicly elected the day before yesterday, carrying evidence, to visit the provincial education authorities and report everything in person. Local pottery households and gentry have long been dissatisfied with the current state of the school and will also come forward to uphold public opinion. It is rumored that the principal has a certain background, but with public opinion to be feared, he is bound to be dismissed.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday issued an order to ten private schools in the city, including Chengzhong Middle School, stating that it had received the Ministry of Education's Order No. 3309, which stated that Director Gu Shusen had submitted an inspection report on education in Shanghai. Based on this report, (omitted) the city's population has increased sharply, and the number of out-of-school children is large, while the existing schools are of varying quality. The report recommends improvements that should be implemented accordingly. (omitted) There is no shortage of schools in the city's public and private middle schools that are large in scale, well-equipped, and have excellent results. However, there are also quite a few schools that are not well-managed. For example, the principal of Private Chengzhong Middle School cannot be a full-time resident principal, teachers and staff cannot work in the same room, and guidance work is also too lax. The classrooms of Private McTyeire School for Girls do not meet the needs, and the content and arrangement of the curriculum are not very reasonable. The teaching equipment of Private Nanyang Girls' Middle School is insufficient. The Private Zhirenyong Girls' School has narrow school buildings and a chaotic order, and the students' clothing is also too extravagant. The students in private church schools such as Private Aurora University Affiliated Middle School and Private Xuhui Middle School lack lively spirit in their extracurricular activities. They should all be ordered to improve separately. There are also four private physical education normal schools, but there are not many that are fully equipped and have serious classes. They should also be urged to implement the improvements separately. The schools are hereby ordered to make effective improvements within two months of receiving this order and report back for verification.</p>

<p>The private Guanlan Middle School in Luodian Town, Baoshan County, was established by local figures in memory of the late great educator Mr. Yuan Guanlan. It has been established for four years. Feng Guohua, the Director of the Education Bureau of the county, submitted a report to the Education Department to revoke the registration of the school's board of directors and dissolve the school. Local figures are filled with indignation. On the 19th, the school organized a petition group to go to the city to petition the county party headquarters, the county government, and the education bureau. Representatives from the county party headquarters and the county government met with them and the result was satisfactory. However, Director Feng of the Education Bureau did not meet with them. As it was getting late, representatives from the county government earnestly persuaded the petition group to leave the city and return to the school.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Huizhong Middle School in Ximen Xieqiao, this city, invited Chen Bai, the Section Chief of the Municipal Education Bureau, to give a speech at the school. Principal Zhang Dongmin presided over the meeting. After the opening ceremony, the chairman gave a brief introduction and then invited Section Chief Chen to give his speech. The topic was "The Issue of Young People Seeking Knowledge." The gist of the speech was that the era of youth is the most precious because the foundation of one's life's work is laid during this period. In this time of national crisis, when foreign aggression is urgent and the country is in turmoil, young students must bury themselves in hard work and strive to improve themselves in the four aspects of morality, intellect, physical fitness, and social skills. Only by doing so can they shoulder the mission of the times and become the youth of the times.</p>

<h3 id="e250">Cathode Ray Adjustment Indicator <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>Currently, superheterodyne receivers with advanced selectivity are increasingly developed.  A tuning indicator is much needed to visually inspect and adjust the radio signal to the sharpest sensitivity point.  After British exploration and research, a kind of cathode ray adjustment tube was obtained, named the "Adjustment Imaging Tube" (Junograph).  The shape of this tube is shown in Figure 1, like an ordinary vacuum tube.  There are filaments, screen grids, and a fluorite light screen (Fluorescent Screen and a pair of bias plates) inside the tube.</p>
<p>When using it, the filament is connected to a four-volt voltage.  After the radio is working...</p>

<p>...a fluorite light spot and a short fluorite light line are emitted on the fluorite light screen inside the glass tube to adjust the signal to the best point.</p>
<p>This device is actually the smallest cathode ray oscillograph. It is connected to the last stage of the intermediate frequency (Intermediate Frequen5y) of a superheterodyne receiver... There are two connection methods [&gt;I</p>

<p>See Figures 2(A) and (B). In Figure (A), a bleeder resistor R is required, with a resistance of 10,000 or 20,000 ohms. This bleeder resistor R is connected in series with the last intermediate frequency tube. Therefore, a small green light spot, similar to fluorescence, is seen on the fluorite light screen. This light spot is biased to the left before the signal is adjusted. After the signal is adjusted, it moves to the right. The stronger the signal, the more it is biased to the right.</p>
<p>Figure 2(B) shows another connection method for using the tube. This adjustment imaging tube is connected to the last adjustment stage of the radio, and a line of short, interconnected green lines is emitted on the fluorite light screen. The longer the line, the stronger the signal.</p>
<p>This simple cathode ray oscillograph has other uses besides being used as a tuning indicator, which will not be described in detail here.</p>
<h3 id="e253">New Type of Compound Vacuum Tube <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Ban Jie</p>
<p>Since the beginning, vacuum tubes are divided into categories such as rectifier tubes, detector tubes, and amplifier tubes because of the different functions. Because the old-fashioned vacuum tube can only have one function, and at the same time, it can only serve two or more functions. If there are any, they must be further modified in the circuit (such as in the case of regenerative circuits) before the purpose of the multiple functions can be achieved, but this is not common. In recent years, with the advancement of the vacuum tube industry, compound vacuum tubes have emerged to meet the needs of the times. Therefore, we only need to prepare one new type of vacuum tube to be able to serve two or more functions at the same time.</p>

<p>Tube Pole Pentode Double</p>
<p>The so-called compound vacuum tubes are compound diodes and triodes such as UZ55, U2Z75, UZ85, 2A6, etc., and compound diodes and pentodes such as 2B7, 6B7, etc. Its symbol is shown in Figure 1. A compound diode and triode (as shown in Figure A) has a compound diode section and a triode section in a glass tube. A compound diode and pentode has a compound diode section and a pentode section in a glass tube. The so-called compound diode section is composed of a common cathode and two screen grids (P2, P3). The so-called triode section is equivalent to an ordinary triode, and the so-called pentode is equivalent to an ordinary pentode. The two parts in the glass tube all share a cathode. The structure of each electrode is shown in Figure 2. The lower part is the compound diode section, and the upper part is the triode section (or pentode section). There is a shielding element S in the middle to shield the electrons of the two parts. This point is very different from other vacuum tubes.</p>

<p>Depending on the different connection methods, the compound diode section can be used for half-wave detection, full-wave detection, automatic volume control (A·V·C·) or both. The detection current after detection in the compound diode section is directly introduced into the triode section (or pentode section) to perform audio frequency amplification. In ordinary detector tubes, the external signal is amplified at the same time it is detected; however, in this type of new tube, the detection and amplification functions are performed separately in the compound diode section and the triode section (or pentode section). This is a characteristic that distinguishes the new tube from the old tube.</p>
<p>The circuit in Figure 4 connects the two screen grids of the compound diode section in parallel to perform half-wave detection. The detection current is then directly introduced into the triode section to perform</p>
<p>Audio frequency amplification, and it also serves as automatic volume control. If there is a signal input, the two ends of the two resistors R1 and R2 will follow the size of the detection current and</p>

<p>Wei Xin Su...</p>
<p>Today's radio broadcasting is most respected for shortwave because shortwave can reach extremely far distances with less power, and the static electricity that is most annoying and most difficult to avoid in radio communications is also less interfering. Conversely, on the receiving side, if you want to listen to broadcasts from Europe and the United States, it is impossible without shortwave.</p>
<p>There are now many shortwave radios in the country, but the changes and mysteries of shortwave communication cannot be compared with longwave (broadcast waveband). If you have no common sense about receiving radio on shortwave, you will inevitably be disappointed.</p>
<p>The so-called shortwave refers to wavelengths shorter than the ordinary broadcast waveband, that is, wavelengths below 200 meters to about 15 meters.</p>
<p>Shortwave radios usually have three or four or more coils for receiving wavebands of different lengths. However, these various wavelengths are affected by various reasons, so some are conducive to receiving during the day, and some cannot be received until night.</p>
<p>Difference between Day and Night</p>
<p>Receiving telecommunications at wavelengths below 25 meters is usually better during the day than at night. But the opposite is true for wavelengths above 50 meters. According to experiments, for wavelengths below 20 meters, the entire path from the broadcasting station to the receiving machine must be in daylight to be able to listen. Between 20 meters and 35 meters, it is best to have the broadcasting machine or the radio in the dark.</p>
<p>Skywave and Groundwave</p>
<p>Radio receivers have skywave and groundwave. Receiving sound via groundwave is very reliable, but the distance that can be received is shorter. Receiving via skywave can receive very long distances, but it is affected by seasonal climate and the change between day and night, and it can also produce large skip distances, making it impossible for people in this area to listen.</p>
<p>The meaning of skip distance refers to an area that groundwave cannot reach and skywave has not reached. Receiving in this area will not achieve good results, or even nothing will be heard. The skip distance is not fixed and changes from day to night. This is also a major reason why shortwave reception is sometimes good and sometimes bad.</p>
<p>Receiving by groundwave, if there is no steel-framed building isolation and local interference is too severe, the results should always be good. The reliable distance for groundwave reception is approximately 90 miles for a wavelength of 100 meters and only 15 miles for a wavelength of 15 meters. Shortwave telecommunications are usually received by skywave, and very few are received by groundwave. The reliable path of skywave reception must be transferred according to the season and day and night. For wavelengths of 100 meters, it is approximately between 90 miles and 2,500 miles; for 25 meters, it starts from 300 miles to infinity; for 15 meters, it is approximately 700 to 4,000 miles at noon. At midnight, wavelengths below 15 meters can only be received within the range reached by groundwave. For wavelengths below 7.5 meters, there is no so-called skywave, and its broadcasting principle is close to the emission of light waves.</p>
<p>The changes in the reliable range of skywave are very slow between seasons, but very rapid between day and night. The skip distance is the smallest during the day and the largest at midnight. Listeners are most likely to encounter rare situations during the time when sunrise and sunset change the most. The shorter the wavelength, the larger the skip distance. In addition, reasons such as static electricity, sunspots, and magnetic storms can all affect the receiving distance. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Car radios are not yet popular in our country. Although there are car radios for sale in Shanghai, the price is so expensive that ordinary people cannot afford them. Even the installation in cars is very rare. Its special feature is that the power supply is provided by a six-volt storage battery, and the B voltage is also increased by the power of the six-volt storage battery. The power supply of the storage battery is DC, and the DC voltage can only be reduced but cannot be increased. If you want to increase it, you must first convert DC to AC. (As shown in the attached diagram) Therefore, a DC-to-AC vibrating machine is added to the machine to turn the stable DC power supply into a kind of pulsating AC, and then connected to the primary stage of the step-up transformer, and then it undergoes a process of rectification and filtering to become a stable high-voltage current again (that is, B voltage). As for the vibrating machine in the machine, it can also be designed according to this issue 42 (How to use a transformer for DC), the other parts are largely the same. The antenna can use a piece of 48-inch by 36-inch red copper wire cloth sandwiched in the car's canopy. The ground wire can be connected to the negative electrode of the storage battery. The machine uses 39 for business cycle amplification, 36 for detection, 38 for powerful low amplification, and 8 for full-wave rectification. The manufacturing method of the step-up transformer (T) is slightly different from that of ordinary transformers. The wire used for winding the coil must use double-yarn wrapping (do not use enameled wire). Each layer must be separated by thicker insulation, and do not loosen it. Because magnetic feeling will occur in the coil when the vibrating machine vibrates, if the inner coil vibrates slightly, it will shorten its life. The primary stage of the transformer is 5 volts, and the secondary high voltage is 160 volts at both ends. After rectification and filtering, there are more than 130 volts left for amplification. The filament poles of the vacuum tube are directly connected to the storage battery. L uses No. 30 enameled wire to wind 30 turns on a half-inch diameter rubber tube. A distance of one-quarter inch from L winds 90 turns for L1. L2 is the same as L, L3 is the same as L1. C1 and C2 are .00035MF fixed capacitors, C4 is .5MF fixed capacitor, C5 is .0001MF fixed capacitor, C6 is .02MF fixed capacitor, C7 is .4MF fixed capacitor, C8, C9, C10, and C11 are all 4MF fixed capacitors, R1 is a 150-ohm fixed bleeder resistor, R2 is a 200,000-ohm variable bleeder resistor with a switch (S) to turn on the filament and the power of the vibrating machine, R3 is a 50,000-ohm fixed bleeder resistor, R4 is a 55,000-ohm fixed bleeder resistor, R6 is a 1,600-ohm fixed bleeder resistor, and AFC self-inductance is 30 Henry, which can pass a current of 30 amperes. The dotted line in the attached diagram is the overall isolation shield to eliminate noise.</p>
<h3 id="e263">The Reason Why Radio Waves Are Weaker During the Day and Stronger at Night <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Qing</p>
<p>Let's talk about why the radio reception strength is stronger at night than during the day for long-distance radio reception. The reason is very simple.</p>
<p>Because the radio waves emitted by the transmitting antenna can be roughly divided into two types: one is propagated along the Earth's surface, called the surface wave; the other is propagated to the sky, called the sky wave.</p>
<p>Since the surface wave is propagated from the Earth's surface, it will naturally cause a rapid attenuation phenomenon, so it is very difficult to propagate it to a long distance.</p>
<p>As for the sky wave, since it is propagated through space, it is bound to be affected by the state of space.</p>
<p>The air above the Earth gradually thins out as the altitude increases. Therefore, the natural gases that exist in the upper layer are various thin gases. These gases are ionized by the action of sunlight and are imagined to form a layer, which is called the Heaviside Layer.</p>
<p>During the day, because there is strong sunlight, this layer is relatively close to the Earth's surface, and the sky wave will naturally lose most of its power when it encounters it. However, at night, because the ionosphere moves far upward, the sky wave must undergo reflection and refraction when it wants to reach the upper part from here, and most of it will inevitably reach a place farther away from the Earth's surface again.</p>
<p>When receiving radio, only surface waves are received during the day, so long-distance radio reception is naturally very weak. However, once it is night, as mentioned above, the sky wave comes from the sky, so the radio reception strength will naturally increase.</p>

<p>— Zhang Zongrong</p>
<p>A variable capacitor is quite important in radio. The ones sold on the market are very expensive. One machine often needs one to several of them. The general comrades who like to study radio but are limited by economics have a sigh of regret. Now there is a variable capacitor that can be made for only a few cents, so I will share it with the aforementioned comrades.</p>

<p>Cut 11 pieces of cardboard into the shape shown in Figure 1 (the number of pieces can be determined according to individual needs). Cut 11 pieces of tinplate from the cigarette box into rectangles, glue them to the right end of the cardboard, and punch a small hole at the × position. Insert a 3-inch-long bare copper wire (i.e., yarn-colored wire with the outer coating removed) and fold both ends to wrap them tightly. Glue each piece of foreign wax paper (Figure 2) together. After all 11 pieces have been made, twist all the wire ends into one wire end and solder it with tin. This is the fixed piece.</p>

<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>Although capacitors in radios can sometimes be omitted, the effect of installing them is better. Fixed capacitors are especially important in shortwave machines. Now I will describe the places where fixed capacitors should be installed in shortwave radios, the capacitance of the capacitors, and the effects after installation:</p>
<p>(1) Connect a .0005 megafarad fixed capacitor across the secondary stage of the first audio frequency transformer to make the tone mellow.</p>
<p>(2) Connect a .002 to .001 megafarad capacitor across the primary stage of the first audio frequency transformer to enhance the regeneration force of the regenerative shortwave radio.</p>
<p>(3) Connecting a 1 megafarad fixed capacitor between the positive and negative poles of the B battery can increase the receiving range and volume. (If the B voltages used in the detection stage and the audio frequency amplification stage are different, it is advisable to connect a 1 megafarad fixed capacitor to each.)</p>

<p>(5) If a variable resistor is used to adjust the regenerative force, if a .005 megafarad fixed capacitor is connected between the radio frequency choke (R, F, C,) connected to one end of the regeneration coil and the negative pole of the B battery, noise can be reduced and sensitivity can be increased.</p>

<p>Steward Radio has outstanding performance. The Steward Radio, exclusively managed by the American Radio Company, has strong components and can receive radio from far away. Its ten-tube model is even more amazing. Mr. Da Mi of the Municipal Council String Orchestra in Shanghai recently purchased one of these radios. At 2:00 AM, he was able to receive broadcasts from Germany, France, Russia, etc. very clearly. This machine consumes very little power per month and is most suitable for use in Shanghai. Every radio station, large or small, can be received, and its price is also very low. The company's service is also very considerate. For any machine purchased, all services are free except for broken bulbs.</p>
<p>Inviting Outport Managers, the Shaw-Sullivan Vacuum Tube Factory is one of the largest factories in the United States. Its products are well-made and have long been famous at home and abroad. The general manager for China is the American Radio Company at No. 82 Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>Any provinces and cities outside of Shanghai that wish to manage this type of radio vacuum tube can send a letter to the company for details.</p>
<p>Current Status of Tianer Radio Company. The company is a leader in repairing radio receivers. Manager Zhuang Zhihong is a pioneer in repairing sound movie machines and radios. He has rich experience and excellent knowledge. Anyone who sends a machine for repair can pick it up within 48 hours.</p>
<p>The Great Shanghai Wireless Electric Company at No. 49 Nanjing Road, telephone number 14996, is the most reliable radio receiver repairer. It is currently manufacturing a type of the smallest radio receiver, which is only 3.6 inches wide, 4.6 inches long, and 1.6 inches thick, weighing less than one pound. It can be hidden in a bag and is very convenient to carry when traveling. The machine is equipped with a vacuum tube, AB power, etc., all complete. It can also receive radio without using a ground wire. Not only is the sound loud, but the selectivity is also very good. It is truly an ideal radio receiver, which is expected to be welcomed by radio enthusiasts.</p>
<p>American Broadcasting Business: Under the Federal Wireless Radio Commission appointed by the United States Secretary of Commerce, President Roosevelt recently ordered that all wireless telegraph, telephone, and broadcasting organizations be placed under government patents, and news businesses be centrally managed. In addition, regulations have been formulated that all transmitters should be requisitioned for military use in times of war.</p>

<p>The Great Shanghai Wireless Electric Company has special experience in repairing power transformers in radios. Mr. Qiu of Ningbo had a Steward six-tube radio whose power transformer had been repaired elsewhere. It was destroyed again shortly after being used, so it was sent to the company for repair. After the repair, the use was very satisfactory. Once, Mr. Qiu forgot to turn off the radio, and it ran continuously for 18 hours, but the power transformer in the machine was still intact. It can be seen that the company is unwilling to be negligent in repairing radios at all, so it has achieved such good results.</p>

<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Imagine, dear reader: a stoker with a soot-blackened face, constantly surrounded by smoke and coal, wearing a small, parasol-like court hat. Doesn't he look exactly like a wizened old mushroom? Now, compare his pair of black satin boots, his robe of colors as vibrant as a rainbow, and the coal pile he stands beside, and you can easily imagine what a sight that would be! But this scene actually happened. After all, the Empress Dowager's orders were law, and who could change them!</p>
<p>Inside a locomotive, there were three drivers on duty at the same time. Of course, they were all dressed like eunuchs. Let us distinguish them as Driver A, Driver B, and Driver C. At that time, their positions were as important as those of ministers in the court or governors of provinces. Therefore, they could freely request more assistants. However, in reality, only Driver A was actually driving the train. (In fact, two people were not allowed to drive at the same time.) On ordinary days, he would have a seat to sit on comfortably. However, on this imperial train, no one except the Empress Dowager herself was allowed to sit. Therefore, he had to stand upright. Driver B's job was very easy. He only needed to look ahead and watch for any changes on the tracks. For example, if a cow crossed the tracks, or other similar things, he was responsible for reporting to Driver A. This person did not exist on ordinary trains; or if he did, he could casually pull up a stool and sit next to Driver A. But this time, of course, he could no longer sit. Therefore, he often alternated between squatting and kneeling to rest a little. This was the etiquette and authority that the Empress Dowager paid the most attention to. (16)</p>

<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>In China, except for the production of antiquities, because Shanghai has no ancient tombs, Shanghai is more developed than any other place in almost everything else.</p>
<p>Speaking positively, the eighteen-story, twenty-four-story buildings are much taller than the ancient pagodas in famous mountains and ancient temples. Speaking of roads, you can drive in a car with all four wheels rolling on the road for ten or eight miles, and not a drop of water will spill from a cup inside the car. This is different from cars elsewhere, where people's buttocks are detached from the seats, like getting out of bed. Even the flat ones are mostly like the so-called "one-bump" roads in some places, which are just a small taste of the real thing. In terms of clothing, silk brocades and woolen fabrics are more plentiful and better than elsewhere. Even taking factory cloth as an example, the amount imported into the interior from Shanghai each year is countless. Eating is even more a collection of the best of the East and West, China and abroad, Beijing, Cantonese, Suzhou, and Yangzhou cuisines. It can be said that all kinds of dishes are available, and no taste is lacking. Finally, let's talk about culture. There are public, private, and even "wild chicken" universities. There are even more middle schools of all kinds. There are simply too many primary schools to list. On average, there is at least one primary school in every alley, although some are located in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Speaking negatively, opium dens, gambling dens, brothels, robbers, swindlers, kidnappers, everything is more developed than anywhere else. In addition, all kinds of bizarre things, such as suicides, offenses against public morals, and methods of promoting foreign goods, are also beyond the reach of other places.</p>
<p>It is said that the reason why Shanghai is Shanghai is because of these great places.</p>

<p>— Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>After Wednesday, I look forward to the arrival of Sunday. But when Sunday arrives, it is more boring than expected. It feels like working like a machine is more meaningful. This must be because the spirit has lost its support! However, the melting and eroding spring light, as lovely as a beautiful woman, is beckoning outside. Do you think I wouldn't be fascinated? "A moment of spring night is worth a thousand gold," I want to hold on to it. After all, I'm not old yet!</p>
<p>Ah! Where to go? I was stunned. I wandered, I wandered on this bustling, headache-inducing street. Where are the green grass, red flowers, and lush willows? Tall buildings flank a long, sleek road. The sun, like a maiden bound by so-called propriety, only reveals half of her beautiful face through the half-rolled beaded curtain. Trains, one carriage after another, are packed with countless machines for selling bread, rumbling and clanging as they move forward, move forward. Cars whiz by with a whoosh. Without dust, rickshaw pullers, sweating profusely, one, two, dragging young masters and misses with stretched legs, desperately rushing to their destinations. Arrogant "gentlemen," holding the tender lotus-like jade arms of playful girls, rush forward with a solemn air... Why? They, or they, wriggle, wriggle. I was stunned!</p>
<p>Spring has long arrived in the world. The azure sky, the warm sun, the fragrant flowers, the singing of birds in the branches. This beautiful nature, ah, I have no way to be close to it. I wander alone on the street where the sounds of cars and people intertwine. Here, too, is a symbol of the vitality of spring!</p>

<h3 id="e274">The Harmful Queue <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>The queue, among modern city ladies, can be considered to have been squeezed out and fallen behind by the word "modern." In fact, the queue, from a formal point of view, hangs down like a pig's tail, and has nothing beautiful about it. From a practical point of view, it snags and tangles, making it inconvenient to do things. It is really better to cut it off crisply and neatly. In particular, women from poor families who work must remove this harmful thing. Know that this queue is your enemy. Sometimes, it can even put you to death. But they have shallow knowledge and mostly hold old ideas, keeping this troublesome silk and refusing to cut it off. It is really pitiful and deplorable!</p>
<p>Not long ago, in the local news column of this newspaper, there was a record like this: "A female worker from Yangzhou, surnamed ×××, fifteen years old, at the ××× Japanese-Chinese Second Yarn Factory in this port, was working last night. By chance, her queue was suddenly caught in the machine belt, and she was immediately suspended in the air, causing her queue and scalp to be completely ripped off. The blood and flesh were dripping, a tragic sight that was unbearable to witness. She died before she could be rescued..." Such tragic machine killings can often be seen in newspapers. But people in society seem to pay no attention. It feels like the saying "human life is like an ant" is not an excessive statement. I was moved and saddened, so I wrote this warning text. I would also like to propose a method, hoping that the municipal authorities will seriously crack down. Notify all large and small factories in this city that all female workers with queues must have their queues cut off. The factory should also set a rule that female workers must cut off their queues, otherwise they will be suspended from work. In this way, for the sake of their livelihoods, they will naturally cut off their queues. Then, danger can be avoided and the lives of many poor and weak women can be saved. It would be an immeasurable virtue. I hope that the factory managers will urge and implement it!</p>

<p>Here: The meaning of "Ｃｈｉｎａ" is to be interpreted as "porcelain". It seems more appropriate to translate it as "Porcelain Man" because "Porcelain Man" is easily broken with a single blow!</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p>
<p>Conjugal Yearning Fades in Secret, Compassionate Heart Can Feel</p>
<p>Idle Sorrow Arises After Drunkenness, Old Events Are Hard to Forget</p>
<p>His original intention was just this: Guizhi has married Zhao Ziqiang, but he doesn't know how her life has been recently, so he must visit her! But after seeing Guizhi, he couldn't help but feel endless emotions. He couldn't say exactly what these emotions were, but he felt that the happiness of human life was entirely based on money. If he had solved the problem of livelihood a year ago, then this year, during the Lunar New Year, he would definitely have a family, and it would be a healthy and beautiful woman who would arrange this family. He wandered on the road, feeling nothing, until his face and hands felt bone-chillingly cold. A golden, sickly sun had already sunk behind the Western Mountains, and only then did he go home. Fortunately, the more traditional a family is, the stronger the atmosphere of the New Year is. After Ji Zhi returned home, many New Year's things enveloped him, and he put other things aside. After eating the New Year's Eve dinner, his elder brother and sister-in-law played the "Promotion Game" with the children, starting conversations and staying up all night. Ji Zhi accompanied them for two hours, then returned to his small study to practice calligraphy to pass the time. Because he was very quiet in the room alone, he could hear the sound of the diabolo being pulled from the Zhao family across the way very clearly. From this, he thought that the Zhao family were all adults, without any children. He wondered who was pulling the diabolo? Unless Guizhi, this old maid, was still indulging in childishness. Then, this diabolo must be played by the new young mistress. From this, it seems that her life is very beautiful, she is very happy, and compared to me, it is exactly the opposite. I used to believe in her and the sweet dreams I had, but now it seems that everything was a mistake. Thinking like this, he felt very bored. So he went to the kitchen, took out a copper hot pot, added charcoal fire himself, boiled half a pot of water, and then added all the leftovers from the New Year's Eve dinner to the pot. (367)</p>

<h3 id="e277">Research on Inkstones (27) <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Wuliao Ke (Bored Guest)</p>
<p>Other Famous Inkstones</p>
<p>2.  Tao River Green</p>
<p>Among green stones, Tao River stone is the most valuable. Previous people who used green stone for inkstones used about five kinds: 1. Tao River stone, 2. Duanxi stone, 3. Songhua stone, 4. Pujiang stone, 5. Yu Xi stone. Pujiang stone comes from Sichuan, and Yu Xi stone comes from Chenzhou. Both are smooth but do not grind ink well, and the color is not very pleasing. So, I won't discuss them in detail. The green stone of Songhua River was called the best in Xie's "Research on Inkstones." After Kangxi obtained this tribute stone, he immediately ordered craftsmen to make a large number of green inkstones, all based on the stone style, with detailed carvings. It was popular in the palace for a while. Kangxi also said that its material was firm and warm, the color was beautiful and bright, the texture was brilliant, and it felt like it was about to drip when held. Therefore, he cherished it very much. However, it was only the emperor's temporary likes and dislikes. The stone was ultimately not as fine and moist as Duanxi. Those that circulated outside were also not seen to be very practical. As for the green stone of Duanxi, the Water Rock is also the best, called the saint of Duan inkstones, there is no objection. However, Tao River green before the Song Dynasty was surprisingly good at grinding ink, and because it was in a large river, it was extremely difficult to obtain, so it was regarded as the most important of the green stones at the time.</p>
<p>The texture of Tao stone Tao River is a tributary of the Yellow River in Lintao Prefecture, Shaanxi. Tao green stone is produced in the deep waters of this large river. It is impossible to investigate when it was discovered and mined. Most of the Tao stones seen by later generations are objects from before the Song Dynasty. Because the riverbed had already changed by the Song Dynasty, the stone veins at the previous mining sites could no longer be traced. Therefore, there are very few Tao River inkstones passed down in the world. The most valuable stone color is the one that has a blue color on a blue-green background, followed by green mixed with yellow or yellow spots. What is especially different from other green stones is that Tao green stone must have the tendons of Duan stone's banana leaf white, similar to the appearance of a freshly unfolded banana leaf with dew, with no slight difference. All those with tendons must have a sharp edge, so it grinds ink differently from other inkstones. Huang Shangu wrote a poem for Zhang Wenqian: "I give you Tao green containing wind ripples, it can temper the brush tip as sharp as a cone." Zhang and Shangu's poem said: "A bright window tests ink, showing moisture, Duanxi and Shezhou have no such color." Chao Wugui wrote a poem with Shangu: "A Taozhou stone is more valuable than two Zhao Bi jades, the duck head of the Han River has no such color." Yang Xinxiang's poem said: "I only see the moth green carved in Linzhou, why use the Mei Zi of Shexi?" All of this is enough to prove that the ancients cherished Tao stone.</p>

<h3 id="e278">Finance One Day in the Gold Market, There Was Little Difference in Fluctuation International Telegrams Were More Favorable to Sellers After Twisting and Turning, There Was a Slight Drop of One Cent <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>The gold market was very stable yesterday. Telegrams were more favorable to sellers. It was quite tiring in the middle. The fluctuation was narrow. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market in both England and America shrank. The forward silver price on the Metal Exchange rose by 2.5 to 4 cents. The exchange rate also increased. London raw gold fell by one penny. American cotton fell by six pennies. American wheat shrank by 2.875. The wool market opened slightly weak, but there were few transactions. Those who took advantage of the low price were very eager and level. It hovered around five yuan. After the opening, a Reuters telegram reported that President Roosevelt had originally scheduled to meet with silver faction leaders today, but was forced by the office to postpone it to Saturday. HSBC's list, England and America were both flat, and the gold market rose slightly. After entering, the situation stabilized and only hovered. However, the rise and fall were extremely narrow and the market was mediocre. Then a Reuters telegram stated that the American Agricultural Conference proposed to the President to immediately raise the price of gold to the most negotiable point, within the limits of the law, in order to increase the purchasing power of farmers, and advocated restoring monthly silver coins in the hope of returning prices to the 1926 level. There was a slight drop, but the banks were still clinging to it. At noon, it hovered around six yuan. The later market was due to a Reuters telegram that the United States was discussing listing silver as an international currency, and it was rumored that President Roosevelt had made slight concessions on the silver bill in Congress. The silver price on the Seattle night market rose again by 0.25, and the gold market once fell, but after the low, it was still able to rise. The price of pure gold was 981 yuan, and the swap premium fell to within five yuan. Today, the market situation for one day is recorded as follows:</p>

Yuankang, Xiangda, and Decheng sold at 5 yuan and 4 jiao, but the domestic market was still flat. Tongchun, Hengxing, Yuqingyongfuxingyong, etc. continued to buy, and it rose again to 6 yuan and 5 jiao. The bank stubbornly clung to the near and far, and the gold market also stabilized. After the Reuters telegram about the American Farmers Association's request to raise the price of silver came, Hengtai and Hengyu came to sell, so it fell to 4 yuan and 8 jiao. Mitsui and Huabi ate September American dollars at 125, and August at 35 yuan. Hengchang, Yongda, Fayong, and Huixiang took advantage of the low price to buy and rose back to over 6 yuan. Zhengjin stuffed July American dollars at 8125. Although it fell slightly, it still rose because Tongfeng Heng, etc. were still entering.

After entering, June American dollars at 8125 were difficult to settle, and the gold market stabilized. Zhifengyongda, Fayong, Yuqingyongshunmao, etc. bought in succession and gradually rose to about 5 yuan. After that, there was a slight decline, but due to large households such as Yuanmaoyongyidayong buying strips, the trend continued to be stable. The closing price was 965 yuan and 6 jiao, and the goods were sold at 5 yuan. After the market closed, Cuitai sold strips, and Yidayong still had an appetite, hovering around 5 yuan. The highest price during the day was 966 yuan and 5 jiao, and the lowest price was 963 yuan and 5 jiao, a fluctuation of 3 yuan. As a result, it fell slightly by one jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was calculated at 34 yuan because HSBC Bank's American exchange rate was not changed, which was equivalent to a standard gold price of 1,017 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 52 yuan strong, with little difference compared to the previous close. The booked price for May was 974 yuan, and for June it was 966 yuan.

In the later market, Hengyu, etc. paid Yuanmaoshengyong to 5 yuan and 1 jiao. Finally, there was a lack of positions, but the situation was higher. As of today, there were still 8,806 May slips left, with a total of 8 long positions and 27 short positions.</p>

According to the survey, there were about one million receipts and withdrawals. However, new transactions in the silver and money industry were indeed as rare as stars, far less than the situation at the end of last year's tenth quarter. As for the current tea cocoon, it is also far less prosperous than last year, so the current outfit funds are silent. It was heard yesterday that 550,000 foreign dollars were used for tea from northern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, but the source was only 100,000 from the inland, and nothing else was seen or heard. The interbank lending rate in the market was 3% in both the morning and noon markets, which was 0.2% lower than the previous day. The overdraft rate was also 0.2%, and even reached a white mark. The turnover of interbank loan tickets was over 4.2 million in the morning market, with new transactions of over 300,000, and over 400,000 in the noon market. Transactions in the Small General Association amounted to over 500,000. The transaction of redeeming and making new foreign currency mortgage loans was over 2 million. The recall and issuance of banknotes was over 2.7 million. The bank's receipts and withdrawals also increased compared to the previous day. The foreign banks' receipt and withdrawal of bills and money was over 3.1 million. The receipt and withdrawal of various goods exchange mortgage miscellaneous money was over 5 million. The outflow of warehouse money was 700,000. The Chinese banks' receipt and withdrawal of bills and money was over 2.7 million. The receipt and withdrawal of various goods exchange tax mortgage miscellaneous money was over 4.9 million. The outflow of warehouse money was 500,000. The Japanese banks' receipt and withdrawal of bills and money was over 2.2 million. The receipt and withdrawal of various goods exchange miscellaneous money was over 4.1 million. The outflow of warehouse money was 800,000. The money shop's receipt and withdrawal of foreign public orders was over 45 million. The receipt and withdrawal of foreign overdraft money was over 9.4 million. The exchange from various routes was over 500,000. The receipt of cash was 670,000. The total number of exchanges at the local clearing house on the 20th was 10,559,289 yuan 8 jiao 1 fen in silver dollars, including 3,527,982 yuan 8 jiao 7 fen in silver dollars, and 7,031,306 yuan 9 jiao 4 fen in exchange silver dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e281">Subsidiary Currency Did Not Fluctuate Greatly <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, the subsidiary currency market situation has been characterized by few transactions and sluggish market prices, resulting in a chaotic situation from beginning to end, with no significant fluctuations. Yesterday was also the same. The morning and noon markets for Jiangnan small silver dollars were still 838 yuan, the same as the previous day. The transactions made were 7,000 jiao in the morning market and no transactions in the noon market. The Guangdong small silver dollars also only differed by a slight 0.2 yuan in the two markets, with the morning market at 749 yuan and 8 jiao and the noon market at 750 yuan. The result was the same as the noon market of the previous day. The transactions made were 45,000 jiao in the morning market and 20,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins increased slightly by 500 wen, to 325 strings of wen. The transaction consideration was 10,400 foreign dollars. The number of customers was 33,800 strings of wen.</p>
<h3 id="e282">Securities: Government Bonds Sold Off by Northern Banks, Bullish Sentiment Shaken <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange continued to be sluggish. Given the unfavorable external news and major players taking profits without rolling over their positions, the trend was weak. Bullish sentiment gradually showed signs of wavering. Northern banks were particularly active in selling. Although the 53rd issue still had some appetite for national debt related to troop reduction, it was limited, and signs of satiation were evident.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, the market was supported in the morning opening by the 53rd issue's troop reduction tie-in, with retail investors still showing some appetite, generally bidding slightly better by 5-10 cents. The 20th issue, having fallen significantly the previous day, rebounded by 40 cents. In the second session, the 4th issue alone sold the 20th issue, causing it to quickly retrace by a small 40 cents. Other issues also followed, declining by small margins of 20-30 cents.</p>
<p>In the afternoon sessions, there was still no sign of recovery. Troop reduction bonds fell more significantly due to diminished buying interest, while other bonds also weakened by 10-20 cents per session. At the close, only the near-term troop reduction bonds and the long-term salt tax bonds improved slightly by 5-10 cents. There was no sign of a return to bullishness.</p>
<p>The settlement date has been set for the 27th. With only four trading days remaining in the current month, major short sellers are unlikely to roll over their positions, which is a matter of great concern for future market infighting. The final market results showed declines ranging from 10-20 cents to 45 cents, with the 22nd year Customs bonds falling the most, by 70 cents. However, some issues saw slight gains of 10-20 cents. The total trading volume was 14,047,000 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in spot transactions and 14,045,000 yuan in futures.

<h3 id="e283">Uneven Performance in New York Stock Market <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>According to a Wall Street Journal report from Sin Feng Yang Hang, the New York stock market showed mixed performance yesterday. The Canadian government's plan to impose a 10% tax on domestically produced gold led to a sharp decline in gold and silver mining stocks. Simultaneously, a renewed sharp drop in wheat prices put pressure on the stock market. Later, President Roosevelt agreed to meet with Senate silver advocates to discuss silver issues, causing silver stocks to rebound quickly.</p>
<p>Wheat once plunged by 5 cents due to Agriculture Secretary Wallace's prediction that US wheat prices would reach parity with world wheat prices within the year. It is claimed that for US grains to compete with other countries in the world market, the price difference between domestic and Liverpool prices must be eliminated. Corn and oats were strong, and wheat's market position improved due to recent heavy selling by bulls. Therefore, the market turned higher at the end.</p>
<p>The small exchange fell due to weakness in gold mining stocks. US government bonds were mixed, with high-grade bonds stable and foreign government bonds showing mixed gains and losses. According to a report from the bank's agent, the (securities) market remained firm and was unaffected by commodities. (Wheat) Agriculture Secretary Wallace's statement that US wheat prices should reach parity with world prices led to selling by bulls, but strong buying persisted due to unfavorable weather in the Northwest region, making a price decline unnecessary at present. (Cotton) Reports suggest that President Roosevelt and the Senate may reach a compromise on the Dies silver proposal. With wheat finally rebounding, the cotton market ultimately turned higher, but the situation remains uncertain. (Rubber) The market was dull and stable, with very little physical supply. (Sugar) Despite selling by bulls, the market remained stable with a sound market position, and positive news could lead to a rise. (Silver) The opening was unremarkable, but the market rose in the afternoon due to rumors that President Roosevelt had agreed to reconsider the silver legislation issue. Bulls took profits at the end, causing a slight easing. The closing price was lower than the selling price after the close, as the silver conference will be postponed until Saturday. The total daily trading volume was 1.33 million shares. The Dow Jones indexes are listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market, after an initial decline followed by a rise, has shown a slight stabilization. The marked yarn price for April has fallen by 23.5 yuan from its peak. Those who profited have unanimously covered their short positions. There are still several thousand bales of old inventory due to expire, reportedly being taken over by the exchange, which may help stabilize the market. There are rumors that Hankou yarn factories may implement work stoppages, which should make the yarn market quieter.</p>

<p>The marked yarn market opened weaker in the morning session, following the poor performance of foreign cotton. Prices for all months fell by 4, 5, and 6 cents. In the afternoon, it was reported that spot yarn trading was good, with prices for all months rising by 1, 2, 3, and 4 cents. The total daily trading volume was 14,800 bales. Sales included Da Chang (700 bales), Heng Yi (1,000 bales), Da Feng (750 bales), Yuan Da (400 bales), Yuan Da (400 bales), Tai Chang (750 bales), Xin Cheng (1,050 bales), and Shen Chang (450 bales).

<p>The cotton market is gradually showing signs of weakness as American and Indian cotton markets have been softening daily. It is feared that prices may not decline. Hankou yarn factories are reportedly reducing or halting production due to poor yarn sales. As a result, spot cotton transactions are naturally decreasing. However, buyers are holding onto their acquired positions, preventing a decline. The market is thus in a state of fluctuation.</p>

Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 7 points and futures prices fell by 7-8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 13 points.

<p>Tianjin News: The cotton market in this city remains unchanged. Good quality cotton appears to be firm, while lower quality cotton is still fluctuating. There is a lack of large-scale sales. Shanghai-based Yu Ji Bank purchased 200 bales, with an asking price of 38.5 yuan. Most foreign merchants are dull.</p>
<h3 id="e293">Food: Bulls and Factories Aggressively Sell, Wheat Flour Prices Hit Record Low of $1.9889 <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, prices for all months shifted from a quiet state to a sharp downward trend. This situation had been brewing for many days. However, a part of the factories, constrained by ingrained habits, were unwilling to follow the natural trend and gradually reduce their holdings. Nevertheless, both northern and southern merchants felt that sales were not improving, so they remained unmoved, hovering around 2.05 yuan for more than a month. It was difficult to rise, and there was no way to fall. Until recently, overseas wheat markets continued to decline sharply, which had a profound impact on the local market. Small factories began to sell off, and large factories secretly followed suit. In recent days, the market has seemed to be in a state of panic. Yesterday, because Chicago prices fell by about 1 yuan and Canadian prices fell by 20-30 cents, market sentiment was very weak at the opening. Bulls sold in a frenzy, and factories also reduced their holdings, causing the market to decline step by step. The new low record since the establishment of the exchange has also been revealed. For example, the prices for June, July, August, and September all broke the 2 yuan mark, falling to 1.9889 yuan. This record seems to be following the decline in the prices of various commodities and cannot be avoided anymore.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the market sentiment of the first three sessions was still weak and soft to the extreme. For example, the price for May also fell to 2 yuan, the price for June fell to 1.9725 yuan, the price for July fell to 1.965 yuan, the price for August fell to 1.975 yuan, and the price for September fell to 1.9875 yuan. The miserable trend was unprecedented. Because the factory sales were not price-limited, the decline was even greater. Later, due to short covering, prices rebounded slightly. According to speculation in the industry, now that the 2 yuan mark has been broken, it would not be surprising even if the price fell to 1.5 yuan. As a result, prices for April, May, and June each fell by 2.5 cents, the price for July fell by 2.25 cents, the price for August fell by 2.75 cents, and the price for September fell by 3.25 cents. The total daily trading volume was also large, reaching 689,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e294">Semai Wheat Drops Frequently by 7-8 Points <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the Semai wheat futures market in the morning, prices for all months showed a sluggish trend. Although foreign wheat prices, such as those in Chicago, fell by about 1 yuan and Canadian prices fell by 20-30 cents, the buyers and sellers were holding each other back. Although the trend was not good, the decline only reached 20-30 cents. In the afternoon, the situation suddenly changed drastically. The wheat flour market fell sharply, and both industry insiders and outsiders became very uneasy. The opening price was invisibly reduced by 50-60 cents. Later, it still did not improve. Because delivery was approaching for this month, the supply was abundant, and the wheat flour market lacked actual sales to support it, sentiment was also very poor. By the close, the price for this month had plunged by 8 points, the price for June had fallen by 8 points, the price for July had fallen by 8 points, and the price for August had fallen by 7 points. September had just started trading, and the price was as low as 2.79 yuan. The factory demand for spot wheat was quiet, and there were no cloud wheat purchases.</p>
<h3 id="e295">Thick Keng Rice Supply Scarce, Price Increased by 5 Cents <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source of supply from various trading groups is near the 30th (more than 5,000 piculs), but the majority is late rice, accounting for two-thirds. Thick keng rice and other varieties are in the minority. On the sales side, the stomach of shops in this street has seen a slight decline. Fortunately, thick keng rice is scarce, and sellers are very eager, so the color can still remain tight. Prices of goods such as Changbang, Sutong, and Nangang have increased by 30-50 cents. The situation of Du Yangjian rice is stable due to the slight influence of guest jiian rice. The original limited goods are still tight. The passenger-bang bao appetite of the North and South Ocean gangs continues to move. The initial shape is quite lively, and the subsequent source continues to arrive, slightly frustrated. The question of eating, and the resulting disk, became increasingly serious. Until the market closed, statistics showed that the two gangs had a total intake of nearly 3,000 bags of late rice from Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, etc. The market was generally down. And it was rumored that the passenger family had recently received a call, which ordered them to temporarily stop doing it. Is it true, it is still a question, if or fact, it is difficult to be optimistic about the trend.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 10 loads of goods from the river arrived at the port, and the river stock was less than 120 loads. The market's appetite for various colors, as soon as the passengers were on the market, shouted tightly a few points. The store did not greedy, so it turned dull. The prices of Bai Yuan, Yangjian, Dujian, Bujian, Kejian, early rice, and thin rice were stable. Baiyuan high-quality goods continued to rise by one corner, and medium-quality goods also added 50-60 cents. Yin Yuan goods were scarce and stood firm.</p>
<h3 id="e296">Wen and Tai Groups Enthusiastically Purchase Passenger Rice <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market of passenger rice was originally smooth in arrival and sale, and the market was stable. Yesterday, Wen and Tai groups suddenly came to the market to enthusiastically purchase, and their appetite was very strong. It was not inferior to the greed of the group. The prosperity of Fuzhou in Fujian Province was also strong, so the two sides competed to buy, and the market rose together. Although the arrival was endless, the market price still rose by 50-60 cents, especially the rough rice and medium-quality machine rice were active, because the Wen and Tai groups paid attention to this. The whole city heard that 9 more bags were sold, and the books were all divided between the Fujian and Wen Tai groups. There is even a rumor that before the city, the two places still need 200,000 bags, so the owners are even more hopeful.</p>
<h3 id="e297">Yellow Soybean Sales Active, Market Stable <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's yellow soybean market was still in a stable trend, and the price only fluctuated by 10-20 cents, so the market was not very glorious or disgraced. Yesterday, it was estimated that the factories purchased more than 4,000 bags of Guizhong, and the price was pulled to 2.65 yuan, and 3 cars of Yingzhou soybeans, the price was pulled to 2.56 yuan, and 1 car of Bengbu soybeans, the price was 2.5 yuan. The street bought 1 car of Zhengyangguan soybeans, the price was from 2.69 to 6.4 yuan, 1 car of Feihe soybeans, the price was 2.63 to 6 yuan, and 1 car of Mengcheng soybeans, the price was 2.58 yuan. There are still 200 bags from Dangshan to Kai, and the price is 2.62 yuan, which is said to be concluded in the mainland.</p>
<p>North and South Goods</p>
<h3 id="e298">Black Fungus Accumulates Thickly, Price is Level <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>Black fungus, because the appetite of various groups is not strong, the sales are scattered, the market has not developed much, and the existing stocks are very thick, the people are more cautious. A few days ago, the Sichuan group arrived with more than 100 shi, and the asking price was 88 yuan, and the Yichang group only offered 86 yuan. At present, the highest selling price of various firms is 135 yuan for the sub-ear, and the miscellaneous brand ear is from 92 yuan to 85 yuan. The standard small package of black fungus air mail brand is sold for 90 yuan, and the situation is stable.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3 id="e299">Spring Silkworms Start, Existing Silk is Still Thick <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang counties plant new mulberry Hangzhou Heng Silkworm Silk Improvement Committee, in view of the fact that the farmers in the subordinate areas have failed to raise silkworms in recent years, all because the young silkworms are fed poorly, and the silkworm disease is found, leading to the abandonment of leaves halfway, so they specially pre-purchase a large number of improved new mulberry seedlings, and distribute them to farms in various counties, and supply them to the young silkworms according to law. As a result, overseas silk sales have plummeted in recent years, silk prices have plummeted, and prices have also been cheapened accordingly. Silkworm farmers have suffered losses, and their interest in raising silkworms and planting mulberries is lackluster. Now that the Grain Rain Festival is approaching, the silkworm business has started, but there are few people who buy seeds and hatch them.</p>
<p>The export of yellow and white factory warp to the United States is increasingly rare, and the sales of Chinese silk in the United States have plummeted. In the past, 3000-4000 packages of yellow and white factory warp were shipped to New York and other ports every month, but now it has become a crossbow end. This month, the statistics of yellow and white factory warp shipped from Shanghai to the United States are only 85 packages.</p>
<p>The sales of foreign silk are extremely sluggish. The price of New York existing silk has repeatedly plummeted, and the price of British Chinese silk is also difficult to stand. The European and American villages in Shanghai do not dare to stomach and risk buying white factory warp. Chinese silk merchants are willing to endure the pain to lower the price to seek sales, because the spring silkworms have started and the existing silk is thick. However, the sales of silk are extremely sluggish, and the future has fallen into a desperate situation.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<h3 id="e300">Pricing Increases for Flannel <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>The existing flannel market has clearly and secretly fallen. The spring sales have passed, and the summer goods have not seen strong sales. The existing goods in Shanghai are oversupplied. Since the current price of goods at the German Record Company has been reduced, the people are unstable. Today, the sales are sluggish, and the asking price has fallen accordingly. The pricing of new goods for winter and early spring, which have been fixed to foreign firms, has increased instead. It is said that various foreign firms have received calls from machine households, saying that the price of wool raw materials abroad is soaring. Yesterday, each foreign firm set 40 boxes of 42,000 flannel, priced at 5 shillings 1 penny, and 30 boxes of 18,000, priced at 5 shillings 11 pence. Looking back at the price last spring, the average increased by 1 cent 8 cents.</p>

<p>— Luo Ailan</p>
<p>If you like to watch movies, you can also see the news that spring is coming in the movies. You don't have to spend a lot of money to go to the grand cinema of Muai Hall, you can also see it in a small theater in Harlem for a dime. After entering the venue, when the newsreel is shown, you can see the exhibition of new spring clothes. There are several beautiful women, wearing new spring clothes with new patterns, with smiles (although you can see from the expression that the mouth smiles but the heart does not smile, this smile is bought with money). They sway down from a very gorgeous staircase. A woman with a French accent tells you from the side that this is the new spring outfit of this year, and it is a new style from Paris. Undoubtedly, spring is coming.</p>
<p>After watching the movie, if you want to buy a box of thumbtacks, or a bundle of stationery, when you go to a 151 company, you will see a corner dedicated to selling flower seedlings. There are various flower seedlings placed there, with the patterns of various flowers in full bloom printed on the paper bags. Next to it are flower pots, flower hoes, and soil (you have to pay for the soil, you may not believe it, but this is New York). There are many fat old women surrounding a female shop assistant dressed in the fairy costume of the "God of Spring", asking about the cultivation methods of various flower seedlings. If you go to a larger department store such as Macys, on the fifth floor, you can also see the Garden Show. They have specially displayed a small scene of a garden for you, and many flower seedlings moved out of the "warm room" are sprouting. A breath of spring's wet mud rushes into your nose, which is tantamount to telling you: "Spring has come to the world."</p>
<p>If you don't watch movies, fortunately or unfortunately you have a wife, and you don't need to run to department stores, at least you have to read the newspaper, and the newspaper will also reveal the news of spring. In the sports column, someone reports that the Giauls or Yaukee baseball team has started practicing somewhere, or a jade photo of the baseball king Raby Rulh holding a bat. That means spring is coming, because spring is the time for them to practice. The news of the departure of the circus is also a symbol of spring coming; but the most accurate one should be the reader's letter column. If you find someone writing from a small village more than a hundred miles away from New York, saying that he heard the first robin's call this morning, then undoubtedly spring has come. You may suspect that the readers of this small village want to show off in big newspapers, and they didn't hear the robin's cry at all, or they didn't wake up from a hangover and took the cat's meow as a bird call, but the editor is willing to publish this letter, which is clear evidence that spring has arrived.</p>
<p>Sometimes, unfortunately, you stayed in Downtown for too long, and didn't take the subway back until around 5 pm. The car is crowded with male and female employees who have just left the office. At that moment when you can't breathe, there is a woman across from you, with her jade hands that have been typing all day, holding high the leather strap in the car, and with a handbag under her armpit. In that face that is over-fatigued, there is a half-smile that suddenly appears. Although this smile disappears soon, you don't know where it came from, and you don't know where it went, but this is clear evidence that spring has arrived. It's like a whirlpool that suddenly floats up in a pond in spring water, both of which are the pranks of the god of spring.</p>
<p>Women are the most intentional disseminators of the god of spring. You see them wearing the newest clothes, walking the most brisk steps, humming the most popular tunes, and sending out the amorous feelings in the corners of their eyes everywhere. That means: Spring is almost ripe. Those who have lovers should go find their lovers quickly, and those who don't have lovers may as well go to Central Park to run alone. There, couples are everywhere, and the spring is full of ponds and ripe on the trees. If you have an acquaintance who works in the city government and happens to be in charge of issuing marriage certificates, you may as well make a phone call to him at this time to try it out. He is sure to answer you: "Too busy, no time to talk."</p>
<p>Who says New York doesn't have spring?!</p>
<h3 id="e302">On "Literary Sketches" and "Humor" <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— By</p>
<p>I don't know why literary sketches have been criticized as if they were a crime. However, advocates of literature focus solely on sketches, considering them "the only success of Chinese literature in the past fourteen years." Why make such a fuss? Literary sketches are just that – literary sketches.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, "literary sketches" are sometimes also "great literature" ("Great scholars produce great literature!" - Author's note). The power of a long article sometimes cannot match that of a short sketch. It's worth promoting! (Mr. Lin, upon hearing this, should present me with a silver cigarette case.) Moreover, often it is a few cold, short words that stir up great storms, and often it is latent thoughts that disturb society.</p>
<p>Those who attack sketches probably don't understand: the way things are said varies depending on the environment. In a "salon," it is best not to shout slogans, and when writing love letters, it's best not to copy sociology lecture notes. Articles are written by all sorts of people, presenting all sorts of characters. Even those who are like-minded sometimes cannot tolerate each other. To insist that everyone create literature according to the materialist view of history, or that everyone write like Gorky, would ultimately be quite lonely.</p>
<p>Therefore, it's no big deal that Mr. Lin indulges in literary sketches alongside "humor." He certainly wouldn't force today's literary giants to each write a "sketch" or tell a "humorous" story. For example, if Mr. Lin smokes a cigar (though he probably doesn't smoke them much), and young people upon seeing this, throw off their sleeves and rush to the tobacco company, wouldn't that be too naive?</p>
<p>Of course, saying that we are now in the "age of the literary sketch" is also permissible, as there isn't any grand era to speak of. The current time is indeed suitable for the flourishing of literary sketches. As the winter snow begins to melt, and faint traces of green appear from the scorched earth, a few scattered small flowers and grasses embellish the boundless scenery. Although foreshadowing the future, for now, perhaps that is all there can be.</p>
<p>Subjectively speaking, the great literature of our time is something like "children picking fragrant herbs." However, "Ren Jian Shi" (This Human World) does gather together the greatest literary talents in the country, from "Mr. Cai" to Quan Zenghu. The characters are, at least, all present. However, to produce such a "Ren Jian Shi"! Some things are just not "humorous". Perhaps "it starts simply, but will end grandly," and the future will be different. "'Living in a house out of necessity, that's all there is to it!'"</p>
<h3 id="e303">After Marriage <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>The telephone on my desk rang.</p>
<p>"Is that Mei Jun...? Please come to my house at five o'clock; he wants to meet you... Is something up? Can't you come?... You must come, you must come! (Laughing sound)"</p>
<p>Looking at the clock on the wall, it was already four-thirty. I quickly tidied up the documents on my desk. Smoking a cigarette, I pondered the question of whether to go or not. She had been married for almost a month, and during this month, there had been no news from her. It seemed as if she had long forgotten our former secret pact. However, it was good to have discarded something that had been weighing on my mind. But today's phone call seemed to be the result of careful planning, or perhaps she had been suffering from this matter for a long time this past month. Thinking this way, I decided to make the trip, as it wouldn't be a loss for me regardless. After getting off the tram, I found the address she had given me. It was a small Western-style house inside the lane. I went up and rang the doorbell. A young maid opened the door. I told her I was visiting Mr. and Mrs. XXX.</p>
<p>"Please go upstairs; Madam has been waiting for a long time." The young maid answered mechanically.</p>
<p>Before I could consider anything, Yun's laughter came from upstairs. "Mei Jun, come upstairs." A month of married life had completely changed her attitude.</p>
<p>She was wearing a silk nightgown, as if she had just woken from an afternoon nap. She shook hands with me at the top of the stairs and led me to her room.</p>
<p>"Hasn't he returned yet?" I asked, taking the cigarette she offered me. "He'll be back in a little while." She said with a smile, turning toward the back room.</p>
<p>I looked around the room and sat on the sofa by the window.</p>
<p>"It's been a long time." She came out of the back room, having changed into a bright red cheongsam. Before her marriage, I had said that this was the most well-tailored dress. Now, it seemed somewhat tighter. Seeing that my cigarette wasn't lit, she quickly lit a match for me.</p>
<p>"Thank you, it has been a long time."</p>
<p>"Are you still at that company?" she asked, retreating to the desk chair.</p>
<p>"Yes." After I said that, I remembered that she had called my company, or perhaps she was just asking casually. I picked up a collection of XXX photographs on the desk and flipped through them randomly. On the last page, I saw a photograph titled "Old Man," showing an old man hammering iron. I seemed to have seen it somewhere before, but I couldn't remember where. I looked up and pondered for a moment.</p>
<p>"Life has such moments," she said, as if guessing my thoughts. "Yes, have you seen 'Life'?"</p>
<p>"I went to the opening day at Jin Cheng; it was done very well."</p>
<p>"Oh, you told me that. Didn't your sister lose a handbag that day?"</p>
<p>"Then why did you ask me!" she said, laughing and casually taking a cigarette to smoke.</p>
<p>The young maid brought in a cup of tea and retreated, just as mechanically.</p>
<p>"Why hire such a servant?"</p>
<p>"It's a little better!" she said, smiling triumphantly.</p>
<p>The small clock in front of the bed struck six.</p>
<p>"He hasn't come back yet?"</p>
<p>"He'll be back in a little while."</p>
<p>"Is it like this every day?"</p>
<p>Haha, she laughed loudly, inexplicably, "Why should I want him to come back? Someone is treating him to dinner tonight; how could he possibly come back?" She turned her head to look at the closed door and said,</p>
<p>"Such airs, I couldn't get you to come here without begging!" She jumped up from the chair and sat on the desk.</p>
<p>"Come here to do what?"</p>
<p>"What about today?"</p>
<p>I didn't answer; what could I say? I couldn't believe that a woman could become so bold after marriage. I stared at the photograph collection in my hands. It was as if the old man had raised the iron hammer and was striking it down with hatred, and it seemed as if he was striking a certain part of my body.</p>
<p>"Why don't you speak? I'm asking you, what did you come here to do today?" She put both legs on my body, something she had never done in all the years we had known each other.</p>
<p>"I have something to do; I think I should go." I stood up, pretending to be calm.</p>
<p>"Can't you stay for dinner?" she said, also seeming serious. "I'll trouble you next time."</p>
<p>"How polite!"</p>
<p>I reached out and shook her hand, hurrying downstairs, almost taking the photograph collection with me.</p>
<p>"Mei Jun, I won't see you off."</p>
<p>I saw her blow a kiss at the top of the stairs, looking somewhat melancholy.</p>
<h3 id="e304">Bride <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>

<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>"Do you love Mom?... "</p>
<p>"Brother says Mom can make foreign desserts. Li Gu, have you ever eaten them?" The girl, Wu, pointed to the photograph, her cheeks flushed and smiling.</p>
<p>Her charming appearance made her father feel she was particularly adorable, so he picked her up and gently kissed her on the forehead.</p>
<p>"Dad, you said just now, where are we going?" she said, patting her father's neck.</p>
<p>"Ah, you never forget these things!" The father held her a little tighter. The four of them went to the park together. On the way home, they each held one of their father's hands, truly enjoying the rare moment of happiness, and the father was also very happy.</p>
<p>"Dad, who is Li Gu?" the older child asked.</p>
<p>The father looked at both children and then slowly said,</p>
<p>"Do you like her?"</p>
<p>"I like her, Dad," the girl said.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you, she's going to be your mom..." The father hesitated for a moment, finally saying this in a somewhat unnatural voice.</p>
<p>"Mom?" the older child asked in surprise, looking at his father's face.</p>
<p>At this moment, the father was also looking at the child's face. The child's surprise made him feel a little uneasy.</p>
<p>"Yes, don't you often feel unhappy because you don't have a mom? If Li Gu becomes your mom, she will surely love you."</p>
<p>The children were silent. The girl only felt that this was a truly new and exciting thing. She still remembered Li Gu's smile when she gave her a box of chocolates, and she also remembered Li Gu caressing her head and small hands with affection. The older child, although he also saw Li Gu's warmth, felt somewhat unnatural at the thought of a stranger coming to be his mom. And when he heard that Li Gu would be his mom, he couldn't help but think of his own mom. He still remembered his mom's appearance and caresses very clearly. Thinking of all this, he looked at his father beside him and lowered his head without saying a word.</p>
<h3 id="e306">West Tianmu Daily Log (8) <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>Another rock nose, where there is a Four-Faced Buddha pavilion built on a sheer cliff, is a little east of the Upside-Down Lotus position, and faces the Upside-Down Lotus from across a deep valley. The scenery seen from the Four-Faced Buddha Pavilion looking east and south is similar to that seen from the Upside-Down Lotus. However, on this rock nose, you can look west and down at the entire mountain and temples within the West Tianmu Mountain region, which is also a worthwhile view.</p>
<p>From the Four-Faced Buddha's rock nose, go back and slightly east up to Half Moon Pond. One mile further east is Dragon Pool (or Dragon Pond), and the Eastern Gate's Stone of the Waiting Wife. Because we were hungry and our legs were a little tired, we only went as far as Half Moon Pond.</p>
<p>After eating lunch in the Kaisan Hall, we slowly walked down the mountain. After walking three or five miles, we turned east from the mountainside and surprisingly arrived above a flat area below the Four-Faced Buddha cliff. This place is called Dongwuping. The pagoda of Yulin (also written as Lin) National Master, the founder of the Chanyuan Temple, is located here. The tomb inscription reads: "Pagoda of the Thirty-First Generation Yulin Xiu Master."</p>
<p>From Dongwuping, continue west and south to descend the mountain. After reaching the Five Mile Pavilion, we returned along the original path. By the time we returned to Chanyuan Temple, our lodging from the previous night, it was already a little after four in the afternoon. We met Yutang again, and everyone exaggerated hundreds of times how good the scenery was up there, how good it was. Needless to say, we added many more Dichtungs to the Wahrheit, the purpose of which was nothing more than to make Yutang feel a little regretful. This is another proof of the evil of human nature. But Yutang is also a great Dichter, and he was unwilling to show weakness, so he also had his own Diechthung.</p>
<p>In the evening, we naturally stayed in the guest room of Chanyuan Temple.</p>
<p>After spending two nights and one day at Chanyuan Temple in West Tianmu, we had roughly seen the face of West Tianmu. However, we were far from being able to explore its depths and mysteries. However, we had already tasted the six wonders of Tianmu that Yuan Zhonglang spoke of: flying springs, strange rocks, hermitage temples, cloud peaks, large trees, and tea shoots. The only regret was that there was no thunder and rain, so we did not hear the infant-like thunder. Guangdan and Zenghu were also eager to win, saying, "Yuan Zhonglang never saw ice pillars!" This was indeed true.</p>
<p>Chanyuan Temple in West Tianmu has a great deal of farmland, and therefore a considerable annual income. The donations of the believers and the income from the water and land ceremonies amount to more than ten million yuan a year, even if we count conservatively. There is, of course, no problem for the thatched huts all over the mountain and the two or three hundred monks in the temple to eat and wear clothes. As for the internal organization of the temple and the monks' sexual desires, etc., these are probably Guangdan's favorite topics. In this place, I can only omit them.</p>
<p>(Traveling to East Tianmu)</p>
<p>March 31, Saturday, clear but not bright.</p>
<p>We got up at eight in the morning. After breakfast, we took sedan chairs from Chanyuan Temple and went east. We crossed Panlong Bridge, traversed Zhu Tou Tuo Ridge, passed Sunrise Peak, and descended to a valley. We walked along a stream, which is a tributary of the Dongguan Creek originating from the North Pit of Ni Ridge. The valley in the fan that we looked down on yesterday from the Upside-Down Lotus is the area of Jiadeqian Township. When we arrived at this place, our group had become figures in a fan painting. The two Tianmu Mountains are about thirty miles apart. Starting from the west and heading east, we passed the steep rocky mountains of Liujiao Ridge (commonly known as) and Men Ridge, and then arrived at the new stream in Xizhen of East Tianmu. There is a Zhaoming Hermitage at the foot of the eastern mountain. We got out of the sedan chair to rest for a while and looked at an ancient Wenxuan plaque and a small Prince Pagoda. We then went up the mountain again. After walking ten miles, we could see the bell tower and Scripture Dividing Terrace of the East Tianmu Zhaoming Temple.</p>
<p>This time, we came down at Zaoxi Station and went to West Tianmu first, then went backwards to East Tianmu. If you want to go to East Tianmu first, you should get off at Hualong Station and go north for thirty miles to reach it. In short, whether you go east first and then west, or west first and then east, if you want to visit these two famous mountains and enjoy a tour of western Zhejiang, you must pass through the large valley between the two mountains, and the three ridges, several streams, and four or five villages. Peach blossoms and plum blossoms, pines and firs, interspersed with bamboo and trees; square fields, surrounded by flowing water; high mountains on three sides, sloping down to the south, the southern mountains looming, like subjects and servants paying homage to the northern star. Speaking of this wonderful rural scenery between the East and West Tianmu Mountains, it is indeed somewhat lovely.</p>
<p>The Tianmu mountain foot east of the Zhaoming Hermitage is commonly called Tiger's Tail. We reached a small mountain ridge at the Five Mile Pavilion. From here, we went up the mountain in a winding path, one pavilion every mile. After passing Pinhu Stone and Suiyu Slope, we could see the East Cliff Waterfall below the East and West White Dragon Pools on the side of the Snail Winding Road. The waterfall hangs between two peaks and is still several dozen feet high when viewed from a distance. The sound of the waterfall is faintly like thunder, but it can only be seen and not reached. Because we were limited by the date, we could not slowly search for secluded and adventurous places. Therefore, we only paid a distant respect to this East Cliff Waterfall on the road.</p>

<h3 id="e308">Yarn Factory Relief Plan <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Zhongyi</p>
<p>The reason for the sluggishness of Chinese yarn may not be entirely as stated in the letter, or perhaps what is stated is just one aspect of the issue. The author, being an employee of a yarn factory, seems to speak more intimately, and moreover, Chinese-owned factories, not just yarn factories, probably inevitably follow this kind of situation. This is a common habit of Chinese industrialists. Therefore, I have hastily recorded Mr. Mei's letter below for reference. - Reporter's Note</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers have frequently reported that Chinese yarn factories are unable to sustain themselves and will be handed over to banks for management or will implement wage cuts and shutdowns. However, when we examine the root causes, the reason why Chinese yarn factories are not thriving is due to the dumping and encroachment of Japanese yarn. However, in most cases, the factory itself is unaware of the need for improvement!</p>
<p>The author is also an employee of a yarn factory and knows a thing or two about the yarn industry. Now, seeing that our national yarn factories are declining rapidly, I cannot bear to sit idly by and watch them collapse. Therefore, I dare to present the corrupt situation of the factories below, hoping that the manufacturers will quickly rise up, eliminate accumulated shortcomings, and then the future development will be limitless. A gain or a loss, I pray that our manufacturers deeply consider this!</p>
<p>A. Employees' positions are not based on merit.</p>
<p>B. Managers and senior employees are corrupt in their work:</p>
<p>(1) Too arrogant, domineering</p>
<p>(2) Not punctual; office hours start at nine, but they leisurely arrive at ten; some don't even get up at noon, and their presence is not seen until two or three in the afternoon</p>
<p>(3) Do not provide any guidance or training to lower-level employees.</p>
<p>C. The factory's rewards and punishments for workers are unclear.</p>
<p>D. Do not strictly inspect the raw cotton (resulting in inferior quality goods).</p>
<p>E. The machines are old, resulting in slow production and increased wages. Employees are not hired based on merit, and many are introduced through personal connections, with connections to powerful and influential figures. They work carelessly and do not personally visit the factory floor to investigate and research, resulting in numerous waste. They misuse flying flowers, and the quality of the goods often does not match the appearance. As for the shipping of goods to customer brokers, factory fees are added, amounting to about three to five jiao per package, which is detrimental to the buyer's cost. The most hateful thing is that if the sales of customer brokers are slightly active, they will raise the market price and hold on tight, allowing Japanese yarn to be dumped into the market because customer brokers need the supply and have no other option. The factory's runners also elevate their status and are unable to be humble with brokers and customer brokers, and they often engage in private corruption, setting up their own companies to manipulate the factory's market prices. The reason why customer sales are slow is due to these people. As a result, inventory accumulates day by day, and the factory has no way to sell it. They negotiate with banks or money houses to mortgage it, and the factory constantly pays interest. Day after day, month after month, the factory's burden increases invisibly, leading to the saying that they are unable to sustain themselves. However, empty talk of relief is of no help. If the factory does not fundamentally improve, eliminate accumulated shortcomings, and eliminate bad habits, how can it lift the heavy burden from its shoulders? Regarding foreign merchants: they start work at eight o'clock and often visit the factory floor to investigate and research. They have clear rewards and punishments for workers. When they encounter customer sales, they try their best to accommodate them and often adhere to the principle of small profits and quick turnover. They are often available for negotiations even after five o'clock. They do not work as carelessly as we do in our country. According to what my friends have told me, "Foreign merchants mostly made profits last year." Looking back at our country's yarn factories, how are they doing?</p>
<p>The author is not praising others' prestige and diminishing our own ambition. High-sounding talk of relief and empty shouting are the actions of a fool. The fundamental thing is to encourage ourselves, otherwise, we should be wary of having our position seized in the future. A gain or a loss, please deeply examine this.</p>
<h3 id="e309">Man and Society <a href="#e309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— Construction</p>
<p>We should have collective activities</p>
<p>Sometimes, a kind person often wants to turn their own feelings into other people's feelings, and replace other people's thoughts with their own thoughts. This is difficult and unreasonable, but sometimes it is truly moving because of the promotion of that kind of sincerity. This kind of person is lovely, but only lovely.</p>
<p>The psychology of people who say that something is bad always has a belief in something good. Although they themselves believe this thing is excellent, they cannot resist others denying it and feel that many activities in life are wasted.</p>
<p>However, in my opinion, there is always a truth to everything. Each holding one end does not necessarily mean that both are truths. If not, then we have no right or wrong. Wouldn't that become a chaotic mess?</p>
<p>Regarding participating in social activities, it is originally a matter of differing opinions. Here, I always want to put aside the question of "should or shouldn't" and only ask: are we one of the people?</p>
<p>I think everyone will affirm this point, because no one can say that they are "non-human." If this point is acknowledged, then I want to ask: how does the rice you eat every day come from? Did you cook it? Did you buy it? Did you use a mill to get it from the rice paddy? Did you transport the grain? Did you plant the rice? After asking this, I want to ask, how does the clothes you wear every day come from?... And what about your housing, your entertainment, your reading...?</p>
<p>If a person can think in this way, then they will realize that life and society cannot be separated. Without society, one cannot unfold their life.</p>
<p>However, society cannot be formed by one person. It requires a large group of people, many people, to organize it. A society that has been organized has a function, and all individuals in the society must adhere to the principle of division of labor and cooperation, each doing their best. However, individual forces that are separated have little effect. They must be subject to the function of the society, and the scattered individuals must become a collective force. Only by engaging in social production with this collective force can there be any talk of the happiness of all of humanity. Then we as individuals can also have our own safety and individual happiness.</p>
<p>Therefore, a person who wants their own safety and their own happiness must recognize that they are a member of the people, that their safety and happiness are tied to the safety of society and the happiness of humanity. If we recognize this point, then is it necessary for us to participate in group activities for the safety and happiness of our entire society?</p>
<p>Should or shouldn't, it seems to be psychological. I won't talk about it for the moment. I just want to make this point: society includes all of us. We cannot live as isolated individuals. For the sake of our own lives, our own safety, and our own happiness, why don't we participate in these general group activities that guarantee our lives and promote our society?</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding debates about morality, about so-called "despicable behavior," "treacherous hearts," "backstabbing," "practice of political skills," "preparation for betrayal," etc., I feel that there is no need to debate. As long as the major premise is clear, what does it matter if there are some unsatisfactory flaws in the current situation? Isn't it just a matter of changing them? But if someone fundamentally opposes participating in group life because of this, I am somewhat suspicious that they have been poisoned by some kind of venom.</p>
<h3 id="e310">Sex Education <a href="#e310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>It is a mistake to look at anything with a mysterious eye. If there is a fact in the world, there can never be any possibility of secrecy.</p>
<p>People generally think that matters between the sexes are extremely mysterious. Whenever their children ask about matters between the sexes, they will stop them. In fact, this is a great mistake. The evolution of social civilization is based on the relationship between the sexes. If there were no sexes, there would be no society. Since sex has such a close relationship with ourselves, what secret is there to speak of?</p>
<p>Although there is physiology and hygiene in schools, the extremely important aspect of sex is omitted. In the course of life, sex is a very serious problem. Everyone has to go through a sexual life, but because no one guides them, they often rush about like blind people riding horses, thus creating dangerous and tragic endings.</p>
<p>I am a student, so of course I understand things about students better than others, so I will take the student aspect as an example. Middle school is the time when an individual's sexual needs are most urgent. At the time of complete development, sexual desire is at its strongest. On the one hand, young people want to satisfy their desires, and on the other hand, no one is there to guide them on a proper path, so abnormal solutions to sexual desires are produced, such as masturbation and homosexuality. It is almost impossible to find a student who does not play these tricks. As a result, sexual diseases such as spermatorrhea, impotence, and nocturnal emission are produced! Judging from the "beautiful" advertisements for sexual diseases in newspapers and on toilet walls, I don't know how many sexual disease patients there are in China!</p>
<p>We know that the strength of the people affects the strength of the country. Since there are so many sexual disease patients in China, the women produced will not be strong. If this continues, the Chinese nation will inevitably be eliminated by the survival of the fittest and perish.</p>
<p>This is entirely the result of ignoring sex education!</p>
<p>Newspapers and magazines have repeatedly called for sex education, but no one has paid attention to it so far. Perhaps "sex" is detrimental to social customs!? Perhaps the officials in charge believe that sex education is unimportant? Chinese people are always the Chinese people of the "land of propriety and righteousness"!</p>
<p>I hope that the education authorities will pay attention to this issue. I hope that what is studied in schools is not only a review of academic theories. I dare to earnestly ask that "sex education" be listed as one of the required courses, even if someone calls me Zhang Jingsheng the Second, it doesn't matter.</p>
<h3 id="e311">Cold-Blooded World <a href="#e311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>— Construction</p>
<p>"The world is cold-blooded!" I shout this, and affirm it so.</p>
<p>Lower beings say so much; now, the world is strangely cold-blooded, with no sincerity in sight, no intimacy, all hideous faces, all vicious hearts.</p>
<p>Ordinary fields need not be mentioned; friends framing friends, confidants framing confidants, in joyous meetings, it seems that sharp knives are flying, it seems that pistols are aiming. Yet on the surface, they are so smiley-faced, how cruel and cold-blooded this is! Between father and son, husband and wife, brothers and sisters, originally united by blood, originally related as if their lives depended on each other, how intimate and sincere they should be. But in this cold-blooded world, where is intimacy and sincerity? Are they not all like strangers on the road? Are they not all like combatants on the battlefield? Just look at the daily newspapers, your eyes are filled with this kind of cold-blooded performance, what with murdering one's own husband, what with forcing one's daughter into prostitution, what with nephews slaying aunts, etc... As for brothers treating each other as enemies, it is simply the norm.</p>
<p>This world, this world, has truly reached its end; who says that humans are emotional animals? Where are the emotions?</p>
<p>The connection between people depends entirely on self-interest. If their interests are the same, they mingle together; otherwise, they will meet each other with knives and guns.</p>
<p>Because of this, I fear to see the state of lower beings, because although they are lower beings, they want to love each other so much, but we humans, the more advanced we become, the more barbaric, the more cold-blooded.</p>
<p>However, are we to curse the evolution of mankind? That is not an enlightened position.</p>
<p>We must restore the pure connection between people. We desperately need salvation!</p>
