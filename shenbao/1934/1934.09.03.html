<p>今日之歐洲。非如本世紀初德意與奥匈三角同盟操縱中歐之時。曩者法俄協約。東西相應。英國爲保持其海上覇權起見。不能不抑德以助。法所謂武裝和平。乃得在矛盾對立中。勉强存立。現在會議外交旣漸解體。意德之間矛盾重重。英法關係。雖在友好中。亦頗現破裂之象。蘇聯另成一體系。美則袖手旁觀。歐洲之糾紛。乃愈混沌而不可收拾。同時。法蘭西小心翼翼。以抑制德國之再起。鮑爾温更倡言擴展英國空防。至於萊茵河上凡此種種。皆爲備戰之鐵證。不過法國在最近百年間。對外戰爭。先後不下三次。言其損失。卽壯丁一項。已達五百五十餘萬。可謂創鉅痛深。而况戰後財政困難。迄今甫得舟舒。懲前毖後。别具戒心。其於下届戰爭之愼重。或更甚於［暴發］諸國。美國老成持重。其立國政策有如其國民性。故亦僅謀經濟之穏定。而於願已足。雖云備戰熱。忱不肯後人。而實際參戰之可能性。似較法國爲尤薄。是以英法政策。雖不盡相謀而大勢則偏於維持和平。穏定均勢。而其手段。又不外夫運用會議外交。以期抑制軍備競爭之决裂。蘇聯處此局勢之下。確足以左右歐洲政局。而自高其聲價。一旦蘇聯加入國聯。國聯之將堕威信。必將重行振作。此固英法之所謁誠歡迎者也。</p>
<p>就無產階級之目光觀之。國聯本一資本主義國家之集團。與蘇聯不能共同而存立。惟蘇聯欲在資本主義國家之大包圍内。假手於第三國際而造成世界革命。其阻力亦特多。遂不得不轉取守勢。而與他國相交歡。而况其第二［五年計劃］之完成。尤有待於和平之確立。故甚望西歐之局面穏定。遠東之威脅或稍。减可以有造於國内建設之前途也。且卽退一步而假定日俄戰禍之必不可免。亦可灌注全力於遠東。以與日人相對壘。也蘇聯苟有加入國聯之一日。其用意必不外乎是。然則日本其將惕然於此種情勢之發展。而稍歛其對俄之氣燄乎。考諸事實。則殊未盡然。其故固有可得而言者。蓋一則因英蘇之間。在歐洲之利害調和。已感困難。而申亞細亞一帶之衝突。則日趨尖銳。英人贊助蘇聯之加入國聯。與其謂愛護國聯。毌寗謂保全自身。如以此爲英蘇親交之證。更爲大誤。日本洞燭内情。故竭力排俄而餌英。再則美國仍獨立於國聯之外。而英美之團結。又極困難。觀於二國海軍軍縮主張之逈異。可知其然。日本儘可利用此種弱點。而盡其捭闔縱横之能事。英美之行動不一致。日本對於太平洋之將來。仍可無庸其焦慮。縱然蘇聯加入國聯。亦不能遽喪其膽也。</p>
<p>惟國際聯盟旣有新勢力之參加。對於歐洲方面現狀之保持。當較前爲有力。德國雖甚倔强。亦將有所顧忌。結果歐洲各國或有重返會議外交之可能。此於歐洲和平前途有若干貢獻。固在意中。但因歐洲能暫保小康之局。各國必益注目於遠東。日俄戰機。或將因是而愈趨緊張乎。此則我國民所當深切研究者也。</p>

<p>六月中旬、兩位氣呑一世的獨裁者丨墨索里尼和希特勒丨曾作過幾次懇切的談話並沒有第三個人參加、到現在其内容還沒有完全公開、不過這次的晤談、與奥大利獨立問題、有密切的關聯、是誰也不否認的、在奥國本身、德國當前的策略都以德奥合併爲宜、然而德奥合併之後、意德兩國馬上入於短兵相接狀態之下、絶無緩衝之餘地、同時提羅爾更感受威脅、意大利全境出就不安起來、正好已故的陶爾菲斯奥首相、堅决反對德奥合併、意國就順水推舟、力主奥國獨立、借此樹立中歐的霸權、</p>
<p>就地理上關係、京歷史上習慣、以及奥國目前的經濟情况、都不能長遠維持其獨立、該與德國全圖合併、而意大利須北越高山峻嶺、違反地理上自然的間隔、勉强向奥國伸展經濟力、德國則恰與此相反、很順手就作下去了、並且還可以延長到匈牙利方面、這却與意國樹立中歐霸權有妨害、同時更惹起小協約國的反感、法國自然更要抬出凡爾賽和約來作對抗的武器、於是意國更加得勢、挾制德國的力量就更大了、殊不知德國人和奥國德意志族人！國社黨！竟首先發難、把奥大利獨裁者陶爾匪斯打死了、</p>
<p>薩拉齊一顆子彈曾經掀動歐州大戰、陶爾菲斯被殺、奥國衛國團頗借重意國後援、竭力鎭壓國社黨、假如那時候希特勒熱心一點、多給奥國國社黨一些援助、則奥國境内一定弄得非常混亂、就難保騷亂不波及意境、意國兵臨境上、越境干涉、是意想中的事、則第二次大戰誰能保其必無、豈知希特勒力持冷靜態度、絶不向奥國伸手、這纔沒有釀成大變、渡過一重危險、也是歐洲、特别是德國經濟的破局、使她不敢任意闖禍、以自取敗亡、</p>
<p>德國誠然是經濟困難達於極頂、而意大利又是何如呢、現在將意國的財政狀况、和一般經濟情形、略述如下、</p>
<p>意大利財政的惡化、已不自今日起、不過今年格外壞、本年度預算、到五月底爲止、其不足的數字有六十八萬零三百萬里拉、在去年七月以前編制預算的時候、所假定的［赤字］祗是二十八萬萬里拉、殊不知相差竟如是之巨、去年七月到今年五月止、十一個月間、内國公債增加了五十萬零九百萬里拉、其債務總額由九百七十二萬一千五百萬里拉、增加至於一千零二十二萬二千四百萬里拉、縱然意政府費盡心血去節省政費、增加稅收、其效力還是很小、一九三四到一九三五年度、財政預算仍不足十七萬六千萬里拉以上、由財政的惡化、可以窺知其國民經濟的頽落、她雖然努力運用互惠通商協定、統制外匯和信用、實施限額制度、而對外貿易輸入增加了百分之四·六、輸出則减少了百分之十五入超的數字由去年的六萬二千九百萬里拉、今年加到十一萬四千八百萬里拉、意國的國際收支、除貿易以外、就靠遊歷外人的消耗、這雖相當的增加了、但無補於實際、僅略資挹注而已、並且中央銀行的現金準備、從去年年底到今年六月、竟减少了六萬萬里拉、這是資本向外逃避的明證　　如此經濟情形、要打仗豈不是變相的目殺、可是我們曉得歐洲諸國、總是用向外發展來作鎭服國内恐慌的工俱、何况意國正在向上膨脹、當然更要擴張他的霸權、以掩飾其醜惡、到最後祗有牢牢的把握著中歐、再伸展到北非、甚至有兵力來　頇亦所不惜、這是歐洲的危機、也同是世界當前的癌腫、（八日二日於羅馬）</p>

<p>（二）疏浚赤山湖河流域</p>
<p>查首都鎭江間水源之大者、無過茅山山脈之西、爲秦淮河流域、句容之赤山湖、其天然之水庫也、在南唐時周猶一百二十公里、今則僅四十餘里、濱湖之田有四十二圩、不下百數十萬畝、頻年已易洩難蓄、秦淮河道淤塞、一遇山洪暴發、汪洋直下、壧十里廬舍蕩然、人民溺斃、如民國二十年衝撼、首都受害尤深、在民國七年間前江南水利局、即已測量規劃、迄未施工、本省曾嚴令禁墾、並飭有關三縣征工開浚、無奈工程浩大、即照原計劃工程長已達九五·八六公里、應浚土方已在七百八十九萬公方以上、現在恐不止此數、三縣民力有限、斷難勝任、遂致遷延迄今、茲擬採其計劃本旨分兩項設計、一、蓄水計劃、（子）培築湖堤、即開浚湖内河道、以所出之土、加培湖堤、浚培兼施、並不耗費鉅資、（丑）廢田還湖環湖之十一個圩區、約計八千八百餘畝、應查明其私墾者、不予給價、此外另予圈購、（子）（丑）二項並行、可恢復赤山湖爲較小範圍之蓄水庫、二、洩水計劃、（寅）疏浚秦淮河正流、自赤山湖三岔鎭起、繞赤山北麓入江寗湖熟、至西北村與溧水河會、又西北流繞方山西麓、經上方門至首都入江、其淤高之處、以三岔鎭至西北村、及自賽虹橋至新河口二段爲最甚、此爲正流　浚之路綫、（卯）疏浚支流、湖淮旣已分别、擬浚其有關支流、仍非規劃開浚、不足以通脈絡而兼顧上下游之利導、查支流應浚者、在湖以上爲南北中三河上游均應引趨於湖、不使泛濫平地、在湖以下者、爲句容河溧水、均應暢而通之、以澹句溧災害、而增淮流清水之力、上開工程、即照原估土方計算、已在七百八十九萬公方以上、現當有增加、茲擬擇要舉辦、姑仍以此數計數、每公方估價一角、約計爲八十八萬元、再加購地築堤築壩抽水管理等費約七十萬元、約共需一百五十萬元、此項工程關係溧水句容江寗三縣水利至鉅、果能實現、則可安挿災工四萬五千人、維持三個月之久、</p>

<p>草就考察魯省蠶桑報告書</p>
<p>華東社云、全國經濟委員會蠶絲改良會常務委員何尙平、於上月赴山東視察蠶務、期於明春改良山東蠶桑、於昨回滬、草就考察山東蠶業報告甚詳、並已在該省設改良塲兩所、茲經華東社記者覓得該項報告書全文、摘錄於下、</p>
<p>魯蠶概况　魯省蠶業、有桑蠶柞蠶之别、桑蠶區域、以膠濟路綫沿路附近臨朐·蒙陰·新泰·益都·博山·周村·等地爲最盛、柞蠶以魯東烟臺·牟平·等處爲中心、故此次考察途徑、卽以膠濟沿路周村青州及烟臺桃村各地爲主要、</p>
<p>氣候土壤　山東半島、北界渤海·南臨黃海、除盛夏之時、膠州灣附近時常有霧、空氣比較潮濕、其他北臨渤海灣各地、東自濰縣·西至章邱、山多而河流暢達、春夏雨季、氣候乾燥而温和、十壞肥沃而無滯水之患、故育蠶栽桑、均比江浙爲宜、自民國七年以來、中外人士及各蠶業機關、屢次試育、歐洲統系品種、常得完滿成績、軟化病旣少、微粒子之毒率、亦較减低、於此可見山東蠶業、可謂得天獨厚、際茲絲市慘落、欲救减低成本、非山東莫屬、</p>
<p>桑園情形　山東桑之品種、總名爲之魯桑、其中有皮色不同、而别爲黃魯桑·黑魯桑·等、又有一種因芽端葉捲、形如羊角、各雞冠魯桑者、各地皆多種植、產量亦豐、實保存繁殖之價値、最近數年、各機關試植湖桑之處、但未普及、或謂比於魯桑、易得萎縮病、尙待考查、惟耐寒則湖桑遠不及魯桑之可靠、故魯省將來趨勢、仍以改良魯桑爲大宗、其他品種、未有相當之實騐、可以不必提倡、至剪枝之形式、原有者多喬木式、一時亦無更改之必要、但栽培方法、多屬陳舊、每於桑間附種其作物、此亦近來絲市不振農民經濟不裕、有以致之、近聞魯省刈、改種其他作物者、有全數三分之一之多、殊爲可怖、</p>
<p>蠶繭情形　查魯省有向以三眠蠶爲大宗、三眠蠶雖有黃白蠶兩種、但黃繭尙居多數、其繭形繭色、極與四川三眠繭相似、其優點爲纖度綢紉力强、向强歐市所歡迎、五年前、青島鈴木絲廠所出之金泰山牌生絲、爲世界首屈一指、卽此種品種、稍事改良之繭廠繅製、嗣後品質漸降、而有銀泰山牌應世、近則金銀泰山、均不聞名矣、蓋此種品質、高尙之細絲、成本頗重、以今日之絲價、實得不償失也、最近江南所用之四眠改良種、民間亦有試育、但爲數甚微耳、將來歐支交雜種、魯省或因爲重量不重質起見、亦可多多試育、以挽農村經濟之衰落、</p>
<p>蠶種製造　蠶種素由農民自制、卽如青州省立蠶業試騐塲所製之改良種、爲數極微、無濟於事、蠶種不良、成績不佳、農民得不償失、此亦刈桑重要原因之一也、其他如民國九年十年魯省絲商、曾自江南採購四眠改良種散發周村一帶、成績尙好、現時散見於民間之數、似新元浙桂之白繭、卽其遺傳者、同時青島日人繅絲、亦有改良種散發於青州周村等處、但曇花一見而已、</p>
<p>舊法烘繭　絲廠仍用舊法烘繭、農民則每因繭價過低、不願出售、用鹽醃繭、蠶繭經此糟蹋者不知凡幾、故欲魯絲改良、及設立公共烘繭者、爲刻不容緩之事　　何氏談話　據何尙平氏昨日語往訪之華東社記者謂、自本人視察魯省蠶業後、深感魯省爲我國最適宜於栽桑育蠶之區、蓋土壤氣候、更較江浙爲宜也、故現已臨胸·益都·兩處、設兩個秋繭指導所、並分發二百張改良種、在秋蠶期間、先行試騐、明年春季、决勸導該省人士、全育改良種、以期改良、至於江蘇浙江兩省之春蠶、浙江六十萬張、每張約有三十五斤鮮繭、江蘇二十五斤、入川約二十二斤、收成雖不可曰豐、亦不能謂歉、秋蠶已分發、早期者已出二眠、晚期秋蠶、亦當於日内分發、至於絲商界領袖褚慧僧氏所擬組織之海外推銷機關、本會於原則上極表贊同、惟本會因急須每一步謀蠶產之豐富、致不能兼顧並行爲遺憾云、</p>

<p>平水茶每担六十元不敷成本</p>
<p>婺源茶二萬餘箱水淺難運滬</p>
<p>新聲社云、我國浙江平水綠茶、及安徽屯溪婺源縣錄茶、本年產銷如下、</p>
<p>平水錄茶價格低落　浙江平水鎭、爲紹興縣屬錄茶茶市集中區、所製種類、分蠶目·蟻目·蝶目·蚊目·等數種、總稱爲平水茶、裝製成箱、行銷於國外、以美國銷額爲最多、俄法次之、全盛時代、每年銷額在五十萬箱以上、近十年來、歐美市塲、爲印度錫蘭茶所侵奪、據洋莊茶業同業公會統計、已降至十八萬箱、本年華茶外銷、更不如昔、平水錄茶、未能獨異、去年每担茶價七十元左右、今年約跌十元、祇六十元左右、茶商血本尙不敷、莫不懊喪萬狀、轉瞬秋節將届、銀根奇縮、銷路及市價、均不易有起色、</p>
<p>婺源新茶河涸難運　皖省婺源縣錄茶、除專製洋莊珍眉·大帮運銷歐美外、製剩之下脚、運銷於國内各茶號、以供國人消耗、今歲因產額歉收、各坐莊茶號、儘先收買、以便運滬銷售、奈天時亢旱、河水乾涸、饒河徽江、航運阻斷、各號皆囤積於產地、待水啟運、照現在市價、雖亦無厚利可圖、但長此久擱、徒耗拆息、因此茶商均甚焦灼、現據茶業公會消息、上次擱置產地茶葉、共有二萬箱左右、奈無水不能行舟、此項箱茶、何日能運抵滬上、尙難逆料耳、</p>

<p>自南洋歸來、綜計遊覽南洋各屬、首以暹羅影象爲最深刻、當余抵該埠而尙未上陸時、卽受一般關員無理苛刻之盤問與檢查、此種情形、對於華人尤爲留難、毫無法理可喻、蓋因我國在該地未曾派領事之故、華僑多憑彼等喜怒、有任意被其驅逐或監禁之可能、余曾在輪次遇一關員、以其面貌不類暹人、當加叩詢、承其據實告知、謂彼父係屬華人、母爲暹女、因父不義、故不願隨父而隨母、卽在暹得現有之關員官職、亦賴母係暹籍之賜、問以中國情形、據談中國乃蕞爾小邦、旣無物產輸出、且賴暹國糧食以生存（即我國人所謂粗米）中國人民繁殖、因本國不能容納、故年向暹國移殖云云、余聞其言、竟無辭以答蓋以華僑子弟而出此語、其對祖母印象之淡薄與隔膜、概可想見、豈不痛心、</p>
<p>華僑商業衰疲殆盡　按南洋各地之商業、過去均爲我國華僑所開闢創造、並經長期之艱苦經營、迄今四百餘年、最近所有賣買之國產貨品、仍屬十八世紀之舊式製品、以之與最近歐西機械製造品相差天壤、且該項華僑商業、在四十年前、已漸爲英荷西洋貨所奪最近日人以傾銷政策與英荷貨相競爭、經營不滿二十年、居然西洋貨品營業市塲、完全爲日貨所奪取、現日貨已在暹國進口貨中佔百分之九十五之鉅、但據暹移民局報告、日人僑暹者共四百三十五人、歐人二千七百人、華人有四百萬、華暹混合種二百萬、日本僑民經營暹羅不到二十年、人口不滿五百、已能將該國經濟持於掌股、我國經營暹羅有四百年之久人口有六百萬之衆、今反被後來者居上、豈不可恥</p>
<p>馬來亞等日貨暢銷　其餘如馬來亞羣島·安南·緬甸·新加坡·等地、其情形大致與上述相同、而日貨之傾銷、亦竟使余不能置信、如在吉隆坡地方、日貨汗衫、每打僅賣四角、電燈泡每只僅二分半、綢旗袍料每　僅七角、世界任何國家恐亦不能與彼相競爭、但據該地華僑同胞云、祇要當地有我國國貨、彼等在價格上、卽使加倍昂貴、亦所樂購、想見僑胞對於祖國之熱忱與愛護之深切、果國人能注意推銷、未始無挽救之方策、</p>
<p>各屬華橋傾銷國產　項氏續稱、據各屬華僑多曾語余、彼等對於國内產品、極願推銷、且亦樂於購用惟各該地過去如向本國定價、或詢問價目等、往往接到復函、大多所答非所問、或竟杳無音訊、或有定貨不能如期交到、貨品與原定樣子率多不相符合、以及數目短小等等、原因亦無隻字報告、卽有報告、亦須候至一月半月之後、種種原因、卽使僑胞有十二分之熱忱、亦不免漸趨於意懶心灰、此種情形、殊可痛心、而應亟救濟者、</p>
<p>國貨推銷應速進行　現今在南洋各屬華僑之年老者、對於祖國尙有深刻之認識、年輕者已大都喜用外貨、且對祖國印象大多茫然、無所關懷、故國貨在目前如不設法推銷與開拓、則若干年後、老年凋謝、年輕者少祖國觀念、彼時如欲推銷國貨、恐更增困難、是在最近五年或十年中、我國對南洋市塲、如再不加注意、恐南洋各地貿易、永不能復爲我有、此點希望我國政府與人民、同加注意、積極開拓、</p>
<p>華僑商團返國考察　項氏末談、華僑在南洋各屬、對於國產推銷之衰落、以及華僑在國外所受之痛苦、大部原因爲僑民與國内未能表示密切聯絡、而造成漠不相關之現象、如安南·暹羅·馬來·各種之困苦與不便、故該地僑民、極盼政府能早日派遣領事、前往主持、且各地華僑、自覺對祖國之最近情形、不甚明瞭、我國之政治經濟以及工商業等、究竟進步至如何程度、故此番余所到各地、極力致勸彼等回國考察、以明底細、俾謀共同開拓、各僑胞多表樂意、大約今年年底、新加坡·暹羅·馬來亞·等各地華僑、將擬來滬考察國内實際狀况、及工商業等進展情形、以資共謀向海外發展云、</p>

<p>一、民國二十三年夏、中華職業敎育社、舉行年會於南昌、會畢、同人發起參觀贛南剿共前方軍事、一行二十有六人、炎培恒源實負對外接洽之責、國民政府軍事委員會委員長南昌行營、知余等有此舉、特備汽車五輛供乘用、並派副官楊柳君沿途照料、考察目的地、爲南城、南豐、廣昌三處、就中尤以廣昌爲最要、因此地收復以來、尙未逾八十日也、往來僅三日、七月十六日晨、由南昌行、至臨川一百八十里、由臨川至南城一百五十里、在南城考察歷半日宿焉、次日（十七日）大早、由南城行、至南豐一百二十里、由南豐至廣昌一百二十里、在廣昌考察歷五小時、下午復返南豐宿、以時晚未及多考察再次日（十八日）、由南豐北返至南城、留三小時、由南城經臨川、留一小時、由臨川返南昌、日猶未落、三日間往返一千一百四十里、考察工作、計分沿途觀察、實地調查、公開談話、個人談話、書報展覽數種、在考察中、並有電致滬上、此其大略也、</p>
<p>二、南城爲剿匪軍北路總司令部所在地、顧墨三總司令視同聞余等將至、特指定西門内之天主堂供住所、到後正中午十二時、飯罷、由司令部總參議韓楚箴君德勤特别隊隊長康兆民君澤向同人詳述年來剿匪經過情形、及在收復匪區内一切政治敎育設施辦法、並懸大幅布製地圖、指明匪區逐漸縮小、國軍逐步包圍形勢、康君且謂統計共黨占籍以湖南爲較多、因推論到湘省近十餘年普通中學發達、多數中學畢業生無處歸納之原因與結果、</p>
<p>南城在一年前、曾一度爲共黨所佔據、收復以後、對於民衆自衛組織、特别注重、所築碉堡、亦異常考究、第八區專員兼南城縣縣長張伯常君篤倫爲同人講述訓練民衆自衛組織情形、五時半後、召集城廂一帶壯丁、在城南廣塲訓話、並約余等參觀、發令只一小時、壯丁二千餘人同時集合、所有武器、雖屬舊式、但秩序整齊、精神飽滿、殊爲難得、晚間顧墨三君約余等至總司令部詳談最近進剿概况、</p>
<p>三、翌晨、由南城南行、至南豐、車未停、南豐在去年除縣城外、全境亦爲共黨所佔、四境肅清、爲時尙不久、南豐以南、沿途見荒田甚多、至甘竹鎭入廣昌境、田蕪尤甚公路上往來行人、女多男少、各處牆壁、所寫標語、大都塗抹舊有、易以新製、糢糊痕迹、猶復存在、上午十時至廣昌縣洽第三路代總指揮羅尤青軍長卓英、率隊至車站相迎、相將至總指揮部、部係借用破舊祠堂而改拾極清潔、聞余等將至、已先爲之排定一參觀程序表並廣昌形勢圖、又置長桌陳列克復廣昌後所得共黨各種文件、如旗幟、文書、章程、印信、敎科書等咸備、坐定羅君先爲余等講述共產區域内情形及收復地方善後處理辦法、謂［吾等與赤匪所爭者在人民、在人民之心、而不在人民之身、在匪區的民力、大類分之、約有三種、第一種、在我們所謂地方上的地痞流氓、在彼等則謂爲無產階級、因利用之而加以組織、予以種種特權、讓其横行無忌、收之爲爪牙心腹、此一種人是政府所棄而爲共黨所實、國軍克復一地後、此種人當然隨之以去、絶難望其能革面洗心、來歸收撫、只好始終依共匪爲其死黨矣、但是比種人居最少數、彼旣不能回、我們也不必望其回、第二種是田主及略有資本的商人、此種人爲共匪所驅除擄掠、大都遠颺他鄉、國軍克復一地後、極望其能早日歸來、復營舊業、但以廣昌論目前此種人歸來者尙不多、畢竟此種人、在一縣中也是少數、第三第便是安分的馴良民、平日耕田做工毫無宗旨、共匪則衣共匪、國軍來則依國軍、此種人佔大多數、現在國軍與匪所爭者、即是此種佔最大多數的人民、要爭得此種人民、第一要保其居、以安其心、所以［得地必守、有民必撫］、［土地　人心、同時收复］、　語、實爲國軍剿匪時惟一信條、從前國軍剿匪不利、一由於缺乏碉樓公路、收復失地後、不能保障人民之居住安全、一由於各將領未能充分注意到收復居心、今則完全注重此兩點、是以得着一地、弗使再失、得着一民、弗使再去］、云云、</p>
<p>旋即依照參觀程序表、由羅君等率余等一一參觀、先視察附近戰地、羅君指示某處交戰最劇烈、某處攻取最艱難、某處士兵死傷最多、令人目眩而心悸、廣昌一地、山巒起伏、最爲險要、在共黨原視此地爲蘇區門户、故當國軍北路第三路軍進攻該縣時、共黨以一、三、五軍團全部依縣郊北羊面嶺拚命死守反復肉搏、戰事至爲激烈、敵軍死約四千以上、國年數亦及千、</p>
<p>共黨旣失廣昌、氣大沮喪、臨去時、城市留下婦女二千餘人、壯丁一半爲之裹脅以去、一半現已逃歸、死亡亦甚衆、該縣人口、平時只有十一萬、今將去其三分之一、難民由前方逃歸者日數百人、軍隊前進、前綫即改爲後方、所有難民、大都隨收隨遣、現在廣昌收容所、難民尙有四餘、其籍費多爲寗都、石城、瑞金、口糧供給、日有常數、余等參觀時見新來難民有倒斃途中者一人亦云慘矣、</p>
<p>國軍克復廣昌後、所有軍隊、仍是照常向前推進、當余等參觀時、前綫一方達日水鎭、向石城推進、一方達頭陂、向寗都推進、詎離廣昌約三四十里、廣昌以上公路、已漸次築齊、留在後方軍隊、現正從事於飛機塲之建築、余等參觀時、親見八九千人在炎日之下、努力工作、師旅長亦雜作於其間、廣昌舊有縣城、在前清咸豐間爲山洪冲圯、今之飛機塲、即利用此廢城空地也、原有縣政府、在城之東北隅、共黨臨去時付之一炬、遺址由國軍加以整理、闢爲公園、整潔極爲可觀、</p>
<p>現在廣昌城市中、小本商人、因軍隊聚集、需物較多、生意尙不惡、但此僅是一時現象、根本之計、仍望各歸鄉里、服其先疇、羅君對此亦極注意、現正在籌劃辦法中、</p>
<p>赤電在廣昌城北、築有極堅固之碉樓、現爲國軍改造、其他未洗凈之標語、尙有數則高揭牆壁、其中一則、最完全者曰、</p>
<p>［每人一條扁擔、每五人一個擔架、到前敵去受支配］、　　此　因戰爭激烈時、驅迫民衆赴前敵以救護傷兵者、</p>
<p>是午、余等在炎日中、奔馳參觀、約二小時、歸至總部、展閱反動文件、其中可注意者、約有下列幾點、</p>
<p>（一）所有印信、形正圓、四圍刻文、中間所刻、如旂幟上所表之鋤頭及鐮刀、</p>
<p>（二）所有各下級之文書、文理大多不通、</p>
<p>（三）文書中用簡字極多、如［團］作［团］作［谷］等、</p>
<p>（四）敎科書内、灌輸共產主義、引起階級鬭爭之文、以二年級以上爲最多、</p>
<p>參觀畢、羅君復贈余等印刷品各一包、</p>
<p>羅君復言、從前匪方的標語口號是［士兵不打士兵］、［窮人不打窮人］、自從失廣昌後口號變了、說［中國人不打中國人］、［白軍代表、同來恊同抗日］、從前是極力主張擴大蘇維埃區域的、近來出改變口號、不是這樣說法了、</p>
<p>此外羅君對於江西被圍共黨、將來是否突圍而出一個問題、也曾有極精詳的剖釋、</p>
<p>余等因羅君述說辦理善後之困難、在經濟與醫藥兩項之缺乏、二分感動、當塲即由炎培恒源具名擬電致滬請上海市地方恊會會長壽募數千元藥品、並請龐京周醫師組織救護隊到廣昌以資救濟、</p>
<p>余等參觀談論畢、聞樊哲山師長崧甫言、月前有從共匪軍隊携械來歸之連指導員、特招來一談、據其所稱述如次、［尹姓湖北汀泗橋人、現年二十二歲、十九歲爲彭德懷招徠入伍、當過勤務兵一年、家内有父有母、已娶過親、在私塾讀書二年、當過童子軍一年、入匪軍後、與家内人從未通訊、當連指導員時、只管傳達命令其他一概不知、平常共產黨所說、皆是騙人的、那裏能平等、同時跑過來的、有五個人、是我發起的、我到了此地已經和家裏人通過信了］、問［你離家日久、已另娶否］、答、［匪軍不平等、除高級軍官外、不許娶親帶家眷的］、問、［不是有婦女慰勞隊可自由戀愛的麽］、答、［那倒是萬萬不可以的］、　　參觀廣昌畢、下午五時北行、抵南豐、已日暮、此次亨軍長炳文竭誠招待、爲余等預備食宿、僅與之略談近來剿匪情形、末及參觀各地、翌晨、復來南城應該縣敎育界同人之招、開一講演會、會罷、顧墨三總司令復親來招待、約余等談話、從世界大勢說至中國現狀及將來、語極誠懇而切實、談罷、復餉以午餐、飯後北平、下午六時返南昌、</p>
<p>五、參觀以後、發生如下之感想、</p>
<p>一國軍努力剿共之可驚　廣昌之收復、爲局勢轉變一大關鍵、共黨認廣昌爲北方惟一重要門户、誓死堅守、而卒被收復、迄今周巡碉堡、流覽戰蹟、想見當時苦戰情形、爲之慘然、廣昌除近有一石壁、爲炸彈炸成蜂窠模樣、其中犧牲不少生命、尤可概見、現國軍推到達之頭陂地方、在余等前去之一星期、曾遭夜襲、苦戰一日兩夜、卒被擊退、亦可見猛烈之一斑、</p>
<p>二軍紀之嚴明　余等車行五百七十里、所過多係大軍雲集之區、卻從未見一兵一卒閒行街中、到處整潔、尤爲難得、</p>
<p>三剿共之勝利　高級將領言過去剿匪失利、現在何以獲利、係推行四大政策所致、（一）碉堡建築（二）公路建築、（三）召集流亡、（四）訓練民衆、雖贛閩兩省尙有十縣未收復、然而士氣奮發、不似前之談虎色變矣、</p>
<p>四撫輯流亡關係人心之歸向甚大　自廣昌收復以來民衆來自赤區者、每日平均有二三百人之多、都是老弱婦女、大抵赤區因糧食不足、故意放之外出、藉以减少食指、政府從而撫集訓練、此是極好機會、所謂土地人心、同時收復、其關鍵在此、</p>
<p>五救濟之需費甚巨　國軍每推集一地、所收容之難民散歸若干、同時增集若干、僅此最低限度之生活、所費已苦不資、根本之計、惟在從速恢復生產、但孑身歸里、廬舍蕩然、欲其恢復耕種預計每户至少須貸給三十元、積計更巨、南昌設有委員會、在籌劃中、</p>
<p>六人才之需要更急高級將領言到處感覺人才之需要與缺乏、余等行至前方、亦深感千頭萬緒、軍事當局、在極嚴重情勢之下、多方應付、緊急處理、今日之所謂將才、合地方·政治·經濟·敎育種種、冶於一爐、而其根本一惟科學、此其魄力何等徫大、其責任何等繁重、人材是一問題、組織亦是一問題、可云人類藉集團以爭生存之一種最偉大的試騐、此行所見各高級將領、極一時之選、可佩也、民國二十三年八月</p>

<p>昨日中美之雙打、眞所謂勢均力敵、形勢極爲平均之至、以邱林兩老將出塲、理應勝來甚易、但以疏於合作之故、竟在極艱困之情形下、才勝卡爾生史規亞、三盤之中、美國隊且屢屢佔先、皆有得勝可能、邱林表演、亦較减色、否則當無此險象也、</p>
<p>第一盤　卡爾生先發球、發球者皆勝、於是各一各二而各三各四、軒輊不分、四比四後、中九局卡爾生之發球局失敗、邱林遂以六比四先勝第一盤、</p>
<p>第二盤　形勢逐漸緊張、卡史突以二比○佔先、邱林平等後、復重現三三四四五五之局面、此時史亞憑其發球得勝、於是以六比五超出、形勢見危、其中邱林努力應付、連下三局、反以八比六得勝第二盤、</p>
<p>第三盤　第三盤形勢、依舊如此、發球者得勝、一一二二三三而各四各五各六、空氣緊張、一時無兩、方以爲邱林或將失落一盤、其於第十三局擊破卡爾生之發球局方得以八比六再勝第三盤、</p>

<h3 id="c200">論提倡文字 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>
<p>不久以前，有一位先生看見了［文學不死，大禍不止］兩句話就呌起撞天屈來了。他還抱怨到政府不曾在文學上化過錢；他說國家派遣留洋生去學科學，然而科學未見發達，國家却未曾提倡過文學。</p>
<p>這個話，其實也不盡然。自古至今，［爲政者］何嘗不提倡文學。說得遠點，古代凡是［右文］的聖君對於文人一定給他大官做：這是［史不絶晝］的事；卽使有些文人未能仰體聖心］，但只要能給皇帝消閒，少不得出賞個芝蔴大的官兒：這也是有史可證。只有隋煬帝那樣的昏君這才因爲自己做不出［空梁落燕泥］那樣的好句就殺了文人，然而隋煬到底亡國了。他是不懂得做皇帝的規矩的；做皇帝是要［提倡］文學，却不是跟文人比聰明。</p>
<p>稽諸史乘旣如彼，再看當代的設施，拿近年來的龐大預算案來說，這一點化在提倡文學上的錢目然太少，殊不知農村如此破產的今日，尙能化點錢在文學上，已足表示對於提倡的熱心。或者以爲忠實的文人應當有官做，然而沒有，看作不提倡文學罷？殊不知這樣的想頭也有點［時代錯誤］。古代有皇帝的時候，提倡文學的法兒是賞個官兒，現在是沒有皇帝的近代國家，怎麽還用得著那老調呢！</p>
<p>歸根一句話：近代中國歷史上除了康熙乾隆兩朝，沒有比現今更注意提倡文學的了！然而康熙乾隆動輒掛出［御批］［欽定］的幌子來，以表示帝制的特點，現在民國，當然另有提倡的方法了。</p>
<h3 id="c201">寂寞 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>寂寞像無底的深淵，那裏面堆滿着黑暗。寂寞又像黑夜的影子，那姿態是無從捉摸。</p>
<p>深味着寂寞的是一個寂寞的心，一個深經世故的沙漢般的寂寞的心。人越從熱鬧塲中歸來，人越能體味着寂寞的味道。過去是越發熱鬧了，那跟着而來的寂寞便越發覺得寂寞。如果熱鬧是沒有了，那寂寞便將根本不能在這世界上存在。</p>
<p>當巴黎市民的熱熱轟轟的大革命之後，跟着而來的是斷頭機與絞人臺，於是一大陣的寂寞的影子便深罩在全市民的心上。蘇俄在大流血的革命之後，跟着經濟的復興的，是不能適應第二個熱鬧的詩人馬耶哥夫斯基的自殺。丨他是被寂寞的心殺死的。</p>
<p>我們自然也有我們的熱鬧後的寂寞，然而這種寂寞是讓給那些不能投機或不能適應的人們嘗味的。</p>
<p>我們的時代是製造寂寞的時代，動亂的世代把聰明人的腦筋攪亂了；層層的壓迫也把弱者的神經攪亂了。於是寂寞便是聰明人和弱者的恩物。</p>
<p>愚昧的人和强者是沒有寂寞的。如果有寂寞，那是另一種寂寞。</p>
<p>聰明人也有不寂寞的時候，那是將靈魂出賣，或者用各種的方式欺騙或麻醉自己。然而當靈魂或醉夢覺醒了，那時的寂寞將是一種超越尋常的寂寞，並且是伴着一種異常痛楚的寂寞。</p>
<p>寂寞的結果、不是自殺，便是瘋狂，最低限度也將使人心志不清、坐臥不寗，覺得連自己的身體都無處安放。</p>
<p>據說藝術家文人們和敏感的青年們，是最易患寂寞病］的，古往今來已有不少的例子。他們因爲他們的心爲人們所不了解，他們的作品不爲人們所領悟，或者一個偉大的時代的突變使他們變成無所適從了，於是便感到孤獨感到無聊，感到有瘋狂和逢殺的必要。他們固然爲聰明所殺，他們却是爲寂寞所殺的。</p>
<p>當寂寞襲來的時候，理智有時是會失其效用的。沒有寂寞的人永遠是沒有寂寞。而有了寂寞的人，你便是把他放在熱鬧的跳舞塲裏，瘋狂地跳着無，也還中要感到寂寞的，或者竟是一種更利害的寂寞</p>
<p>然而寂寞的病態却不是完全不能避免的。當人在熱烈而專注的工作中工作的時候，寂寞的影子便避開了；當時代是在向上的光明中進展的時候，時代便沒有時代性的寂寞。</p>
<p>至於寫這篇文章的動機，那目的顯然是在殺死一點時間上的寂寞的。</p>
<p>［讓我們沒有寂寞吧！］在深刻的寂寞的時候，曾這麽高喊着。</p>
<h3 id="c202">記莉莉·珂貝（續一） <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>然而，上海是上海，中國是中國，知道了上海，不能就算知道了中國的。在北平之行之前，莉莉·珂貝對於中國，畢竟無所知，不僅所見有限而已，連聽人告訴的說話，也不很多。</p>
<p>這並不完全是由於言語的隔閡。她生於奥，學於德國的Ｆｒａｎｋｆｏｒｔ大學，德語是本地話；最近幾年，作工於蘇俄的Ｐｕｔｉｌｃｗｅｒｓｅｎ工廠，俄語也是能說的，此外還說得法語和英語。上海最多的是說［英文］的人士，她何至於不能同多人交談。然而，問題是在人們該告訴她什麽。譬如她所遇見的威利先生們，和氣而時常表示愉快的胖胖的西兩洋紳士們丨罷，只是這樣的告訴她：</p>
<p>［中國人的生活是很好的，他們旣沒有需要，也沒有憂慮，他們很够吃飽，並且時常很高興。是的，這些襤褸的人們，起初看來，只覺得很可厭的。後來彼此習慣了，倒也不覺得怎樣了。如果你在這兒住久的話，你也得對他們習慣下來。］</p>
<p>怎麽樣的習慣呢？例如威利先生坐了黃包車在南京路走，忽而飛來一片番薯皮，弄髒了他的衣服，他就可以跳下車，隨便抓住一個中國人打，或者呌裹着頭布的高大的印度巡捕來抓人；又如，走着路和中國人當面碰到的時候，那麽讓路的應該是中國人而不該是威利先生們······。</p>
<p>但這些話曾使莉莉·珂貝［生氣］，她不要聽，她要聽的乃是中國人的話。然而，問題又來了，中國人應該告訴她什麽呢？</p>
<p>譬如我罷，即使是我所站得很近的中國文壇所情形，當她問我時，我也不能簡單概括地答覆。我的答案用文字寫成，是經過兩夜的思索的。</p>
<p>一切事情，我們自己其實並不知道有什麽方法可以告訴别人。因此，凡有外賓來華，即使是考察者罷，往往倒是我們把他們當作［百科全書］而加以考問，使之無暇考問我們的。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>蕭伯訥名震天下，到處造成熱閙，那是當然的，即使是黑人休士或者法國的張恨水德哥勃拉罷，來到中國，也不算冷落，但像珂貝這樣凄清的，眞是從來未有。她初到上海，只好找蘇俄領事館，由這領事館介紹給一個通訊社，由這通訊社的Ｃ先生，又介紹給幾個文學青年，這纔找到了一個美國學堂，住了下來，Ｃ先生曾經在新亞酒樓請好吃過一頓飯，此後便只有三個文藝團體的一次公宴了。這次公宴所到的陪客竟只有五人很不光彩。雖然因此也幸而避免了許多烏烟瘴氣的襲擊，可是預定的菜，到底吃不完，她和大衆都覺得很可惜。</p>
<p>在就席之前，談到阿Ｑ正傳時，好關心地問到這小說的作者的近况，我笑着說：</p>
<p>「他就要來的。」</p>
<p>因爲我知道這天的負責者是曾經邀過魯迅先生的，她因此高興得近於興奮了。然而，結果魯迅先生並沒有到，說是中了暑，不能出來。當時的珂貝雖然並沒有表示，現在兩天之後，任先生去訪問她時，他曾經懊喪地問起：</p>
<p>［魯迅氏的不到，是不是因爲看不起我？］</p>
<p>聴任先生說明了眞實的原因以後，她纔又高興起來了。</p>

<p>— 華圉</p>
<p>（八）怎麽交代？</p>
<p>將文字交給大衆的事實，從清朝末年就已經有了的。</p>
<p>［莫打鼓，莫打鑼，聽我唱個太平歌····］是欽頒的敎育大务的俗歌；此外，士大夫也辦過一些白話報，但那主意，是只要大家聽得懂，不必一定寫得出。［平民千字課］就帶了一黠寫得出的可能，便也只够記賬，寫信。倘要寫出心裏所想的東西，牠那限定的字數是不够的。譬如牢監，的確是給了人一塊地，不過牠有限制，只能在這圈子裏行立坐臥，斷不能跑出設定了的鐵柵外面去</p>
<p>勞乃宜和照他兩位都有簡字，進步得很，可以照音寫字了。民國初民，敎育部要製字母，他們倆都是會員，勞先生派了一位代表，王先生是親到的，爲了入聲存廢問題，曾和吳稚暉先生大戰，戰得吳先生肚子一凹，棉褲也落了下來。但結果總算幾經斟酌，製成了一種東西，呌作［注音字母］。那時很有些人，以爲可以替代漢字了，但實際上還是不行，因爲牠究竟不過簡戰的方塊字，恰如日本的［假名］一樣，夾上幾個，或者注在漢字的旁邊還可以，要牠拜帥，寫起來會混雜，看起來要眼花。那時的會員們稱牠爲［注音字母］，是深知道牠的能力範圍的。再看日本，他們有主張减少漢字的，有主張拉相拚音的，但主張只用［假名］的却沒有。</p>
<p>再好一點的是用羅馬字拚法，研侒得最精得是趙元任先生罷，我不大明白。用世界通用的羅馬字拚起來丨丨現在是連土耳其也採用了丨丨一詞一串，非常清晣，是好的。但敎我似的門外漢來說，好像那拚法還太繁。要精密。當然不得不繁，但繁得很，就又變了［難］，有些妨礙普及了。最好是另有一種簡而不陋的東西。</p>
<p>這種我們可以研究一下新的［拉相化］法，［每日國際文選］裏有一小本［中國語書法的拉丁化］，［世界］第二年第六七號合刋　錄的一分［言語科學］，就都是紹介這東西的。價錢便宜。有心的人要以買來看。牠只有二十八個字母，拚法也容易學。［人］就Ｒｈｅｎ，［房子］就是Ｆａｎｇｚ，［我喫果子］是ＷｕＣｈｇｏｚ，［他是工人］是Ｔａｓｈｇｕｎｇｒｈｅｎ。現在在華僑裏實騐。見了成績的。還只是北方話。但我想，中國究竟還是講北方話丨丨不是北京話丨丨的人們多，將來如果眞有一種到處通行的大衆語，那主力也恐怕還是北方話罷。爲今之計，只要酌量增减一點，使牠合於各該地方所特有的音，也就可以用到無論什麽窮鄉僻壤去了。</p>
<p>那麽，只要認識二十八個字母，學一點拚法和寫法，除懶蟲和低能外，就誰都能够寫得出，看得懂了。况且牠還有一個好處，是寫得快。美國人說，時間就是金錢；但我想：時間就是性命。無端的空耗别人的時間，其實是無異於謀財害命的。不過像我們這樣坐着乘風凉，談閒天的人們，可又是例外。</p>

<p>— 周文</p>
<p>［弟弟，你不要夥着他們弁兵們去賭錢哥！］我說。</p>
<p>［嗯，嗯，·····］一句。</p>
<p>［弟弟，你沒有事，哥哥來敎你一點書。］我又說。</p>
<p>［嗯，嗯，·····］兩句。</p>
<p>我再說。。</p>
<p>［弟弟······］</p>
<p>［嗯，······］他把大眼睛一怔，把我送他的新從省城買來的打火機拿着又走了。</p>
<p>後來就常常聽見他跟弁兵們賭錢，甚至吵架的事情。大家都非常担心。恰巧在這個時候，我們道裏的部隊跟駐在我們家鄉的部隊通電開戰了，而且已經在前綫上得了勝利。那親戚高興地說道：</p>
<p>［好，打到你們的家鄉，就呌你媽媽把他關起來吧。］</p>
<p>在路上開差的時候，我很想呌他同我們一塊在後方走、但是一點影子也找他不着；特别是進攻家鄉獅虎岡的那天非常担心。對面的部隊正死守在崗上，沿崗子散着一條好幾里的散兵綫，俯望着我們走到的一條小市鎭。站在鎭頭，很清楚地可以看見崗子上的橋頭正在衝鋒，子彈像蜂子般峙呀呀地向頭上掠過。據說我們的先頭部隊已經衝上去了，那親戚也衝上去了，是正面。呵，弟弟才十四歲呵，那小手兒怎開得來那小乎槍！</p>
<p>等到打敗敵軍，踏着許多已死跟半死的尸體進城的時候，我的眼睛急急地在那裏面搜索。在路上，我抓着這個問，抓着那個問。等到回家的時候，媽說弟弟是騎着一匹蠻馬跟着隊伍進城，人在那馬上小小地怪可憐的，可是他剛回來吃了半盌飯，怕别人抓着他似的，又跳跳地騎上馬跑去了，雖然，媽的那話裏倒帶了幾分得意似的。因爲有鄰人在旁邊，她的話說得就更響。</p>

<h3 id="c207">如何去救當前之災民 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 端生</p>
<p>水旱無常，災荒代有。故善爲政者，必使無常之水旱，代有之災荒，稍弭於無形，防患於未然；及至成災而始救之，民已受其災矣。</p>
<p>古代救災之道，大都損益於周禮之荒政。荒政十有一；一曰散利，二曰薄徵，三曰緩刑，四曰弛力，五曰金禁，六曰去幾，七曰眚禮，八曰殺哀，九月蕃樂，十曰多昏，十一曰索鬼神，十二曰除盜賊。至於爲民上者處災荒之世將如何？</p>
<p>禮記玉藻之言曰：</p>
<p>［年不順成，君衣布搢本，關梁不租，山澤列而不賦，土功不與，大夫不得造車焉。］</p>
<p>墨子之言曰：</p>
<p>［歲饉則士大夫以下，皆損祿五分之一，旱則損五分之二，凶則損五分之三，餽則損五分之四，饑大侵，則盡無祿，　食而已矣。］</p>
<p>榖梁氏言曰：</p>
<p>大侵之禮，君食不兼味，臺榭不塗，弛候廷道不除，百官布而不制，鬼神禮而不祀，此大侵之禮也。］</p>
<p>可見古代救災，具有成規，以視災而不救，救災而專以爲已者固如何？爲民上者，於災年損祿减膳去樂··以示與民同疾苦。不若後代但聞救災聲，不見救災人，而猶驕奢淫佚酣歌迷無如故也。詩經雲漢之詩，周宜王憂旱成災之作也；後人讀之，尙深嚮往，當時之民，能不同情，此其所以能成中與之業也。詩云：</p>
<p>［旱旣太甚，滌滌山川，旱魃爲虐，如炎如焚，我心憚暑，憂心如薫，羣公先生，則不我聞，昊天上帝，寗俾我遯，］</p>
<p>到後代，雖無道之君主，遇大旱大災，亦下詔罪已，固知其爲惺惺作態，但多少表示其對於災民之關切。</p>
<p>今之世固非古之世，今人之用心，亦豈有古人之用心，而今之災，固不亞古之災也。受災最甚者，皆平昔稱爲富庶之區，然非兵燹之餘，即係大災之後，喘息未舒：而農村破產，蓋藏久虚，則又爲　般共同之現象。旱災之來，正無異雪上加霜，方苦顛沛，復見流離。人至生輒索然，飢寒交迫，不思目殺，即起走險。此皆國家社會之損失，亦即變亂之所由生也。</p>
<p>民國二十年秋，大水被蘇皖鄂褚省，其時聞災而起救濟者，情感何等熱烈而濃厚。本年旱災區域之廣，多於　十年之大水；災民所受之損害，雖曰田　房舍牲畜器具，尙不至如大水蕩然以盡，而不念赤地千里，顆粒無收，生機斷絶，正不亞於大水之後。浙西號稱富庶，年來農民亦多以雜糧作食，瓜芋充飢，無它，農產物不値錢，絲繭又不動，幾無收入之可有；　而苛捐雜稅，最後之負担，仍爲農民；一切日用之品小至一針一綫，又無不仰給於都市，都市則轉而救諸外洋；農村金錢只有出去，而無進來，如此而不破產，可謂無天理。今又繼以大旱災，當其初，田稻無不下種，下種又無不望其存活，遂不惜人工，朝夕戽水以灌漑之，冀天或有雨，可有收成，其無如天終不雨，河沼乾涸，不但無水可養稻，並飲料而亦發生嚴重問題矣。農民至是所費之力，所舉之債，盡爲烈日吸收以去，一無所獲。忍飢挨餓偃臥在床以待救者不知有多少；向都市謀生者又不知有多少，（都市正患失業，終於亦不能盡容，）預備結伴逃荒至四方者更不知有多少；然而社會對之漠然，當局對之渺然，正爲水災之來，浩浩淼淼，懷山襄陵，如症之爲急性，兇險若不可名狀，其刺激人焉深，而其得人之同情焉易。旱災如慢驚，悠悠忽忽，人氏輕視及其症之日深一日，則已無從補救矣。然而社會漠視之最大原因，當爲百業凋敝，諸事束手，固不僅對於旱災爲然。加以歷届救災，所以閙得有聲有色，不得不歸功於上海各善團之鼓動。但年來亦爲賑濟之事太多，支出浩敏；收入則同受百業蕭條这影響，損項無從募起，有名之善團，大都虧空。因此除設壇祈雨以外，亦少積極救濟之工作。以視民國二十年大水，各善團則分投賑濟，市政府則設所收容，意興闌珊多矣！是亦救濟事業之不景氣。故旱災祗顧日見嚴重，在上海一片承平歡樂氣象，除糧價高貴以外，簡直看不出甚麽災象來。想各大都市亦然如是；故有米價雖貴，無庸限制之表示，亦正爲祗見到都市的浮光，未曾見及農村悲慘深刻的内容。是則居今之世，能救災於已成，尙不失爲善政：若防災於未然，膛乎遠矣。</p>
<p>救災如救焚，言其急也；緩則民將流離失所作道左之餓莩矣。今日之災亦亟矣，紙上宣傳，未嘗不稱盛；救濟計畫，未嘗不偉大，然欲待其計畫之成功，而始救濟，不將索吾民於枯魚之肆？前人以爲官賑不如義賑，正爲官賑自查災勘災而由縣由府道而巡撫而達部而啟奏而回文，而放賑，手續繁重，辦事迂緩，爲世詬病。但不知亦有補偏救弊辦法，即地方官可斟酌被災情形，先發倉廩及時賑濟，所謂急賑是也。故地方官廳果知以民生爲重，早應從災象發生之時，慮及災象已成未成後之處理辦法，乃旣不能先事預籌，而又臨災不思奮力，即使災情不深，如此延誤，亦必加深矣。</p>
<p>政府之所以辦賑，對於民衆種之報施行爲也。民衆旣平時出其財物以奉公，及眞有災無食之時，政府自應出其公以濟民。在昔有災之年，蠲綏其應納之賦發倉儲之榖，截應解之漕，動正項之欵；不足，則撥給内帑，或由鄰省協濟。徒以吏治腐敗，例災吃災，成爲官吏發財之捷徑，實惠乃不及於民間，然此爲人之無良，與漠視災况者有别。</p>
<p>救災必先查災，查災而果切　詳明，救災亦有確切之辦法。蓋災况不明，無從言救；災民不明，無從施救。故無論其爲工賑，爲貸賑，爲放賑，爲煮賑，以及收容也，撫恤也，若非於地方災　深淺强　之度；老弱壯幼之數；絶曾次貴之分；村鎭墟集之距；社會一般情况，調查明白，礙難得有效之方案。查災旣爲放賑之張本，若查災人員而不實地去查：即使去查，而以經騐不足，一入鄉間，環境頓異，何者爲重，何者爲輕，茫然失措。以及災民知查災之來。必爲放地步往往揑造災情，溢報人數，備爲邀賑之地步；此其中困難情形，前人言之綦詳，不難就荒政有關之書籍參閱之也。</p>
<p>關於災情調查，目下似應較以前爲便利，城鎭鄉村，旣有區長類專職人員，加以各地警察及保甲等等，如果切實去做，不難即成。惟調查最易生弊之處；</p>
<p>（一）調查員不切實去查，閉門造車；有如說災的人所云，前有偏查户口，就將若干户數乘之以［八］，人問以故，則謂［八口之家，可以無飢餓矣］，每家八口，故以八乘之。此等揑造户口册之計倆，尤其於以前辦理選舉時最易見之；假使查災而亦如此，與不查無異，反致僨事。</p>
<p>（二）地方官廳爲將來卸責地步，恒喜將災情報得過分嚴重，如果將來災情勘查，無具所報之甚。則以减輕相遮掩；如不爲勘查，則可多得分配賑欵。最近各縣報災故甚其辭經上級摘發者甚多，正可見縣官報荒有不可盡信之處，甚有縣官雖報災，而尙不知災之究爲如何也。</p>
<p>（三）查災之後，所以須加復查，正爲鄭重賑務，無使災輕者蒙多賑之益，災重者作知聲之泣；應出以迅速，不可行動緩慢，不可手續繁重，要知災民望賑之殷，能得早一日放賑，早一日减輕其苦痛也。</p>
<p>查勘之前，災重救濟不容稍緩者，先放急賑，再行例賑；賑期之長短，視災情之輕重，地方之情形，新糧登塲之時期而定，至於賑濟之方式，不外下列數種：</p>
<p>賑濟（甲）工賑丨以工代賑（乙）（一）糧食（二）銀錢（三）衣物（四）醫藥（丙）煮賑糜粥（丁）平糶丨米糧（戊）貸賑糧食種籽農本（己）收容丨供給食住</p>
<p>工賑者，出其勞力，給以賃銀；旱災年分辦工賑，用以濬河挑池，尤爲防制未來水旱最上之策；但此則限於年壯者，老弱仍不得賑，不堪力役者亦不得能賑也。施賑，就地散放食糧與銀錢，應視情勢而異；如食糧甚爲缺乏，採糧絶感困難者，則應以食糧賑之；如就地交通便利，祇因災後貧乏，無力購買，則以銀錢賑之，煮賑利弊參半，前人論之甚詳，愚以爲一時應急，不妨粥賑，若賑期較長，粥廠旣不能遍設，就食者仍有跋涉被拒之苦，從人情着想，還不如施之以錢粳，任其自由處置之爲便也。平糶只可施於粳貴購食維艱尙不至無力購買之時；若災情已深，民皆赤貧，辦理平糶，試問呌災民如何購食？故至災情已深，祗有放賑之一法。貸賑與施賑，一則爲無償的；一則爲取償的丨取償於將來。在前勘不成災，人民如口食維艱，例得賑粟。愚以爲當前災情深重籌欵艱難之候，不妨酌量災民情况，放貸並行。種籽爲來年有收的地步，甚爲重要，但災年往往將種籽充飢濟急，最好由政府無償發給，萬不得已而出於貸。災後之民，農本缺乏，故應籌辦農事借本處或信用合作社之類，務使災農得有接濟，庶不致阻碍其耕作之進行；將來得有收穫，得有糧倉之類爲之維持，俾無虞榖賤傷農。至於收容，應以難以生存之老弱婦孺爲限；蓋收容不易辦，人衆聚居一處，易於滋事，亦易於發生疫癘，費大而事艱，故如果有處容身不至流離者，不妨多予救濟，不辦收容；若有婦孺掠賣之虞，老弱失所之痛，究以收容給養　之也。</p>
<p>救災之方不一，施之之道，亦應由辦賑者斟酌各方情形而爲之。但以人心難測，民情複榖，辦賑無善策，今古所同慨。故辦賑之有無實惠及於災民，一以辦賑者是否赤心來救災而爲斷；凡與災民富有同情心者，必思减輕災民之苦痛，災民所受之惠必多，反之自少。然以災區之廣，豈能盡得其人，良莠不齊，亦古今之所同，尤其是利已爲性，侵肥成習。有治法無治人之感喟，以及吃災不顧災民苦痛之變相屠户，復豈能保今之無有，恐有加甚焉，則於辦賑之際，安得不望有責者愼重人選！無以位置親故爲得計，無以義務從公相號召。義務不能久，辦賑者非皆如主持諸公不慮生計而以行善爲職志；儘多爲解决一時之生活問題而來；即使不爲生活，則其出行需費，飲食需費，起居亦需費，亦不得不略予公費；故義務祇可救諸以行善爲職志之人，而不能責於專用的辦賑人員之全體。辦賑者往往以賑欵爲賑災，應使涓滴皆及於災民，故靳辦賑人員之生活費用意固善也。獨不念辦賑人員有以生活艱難，或出於暗中侵肥，甚至於公然浪費，則其所損害於賑欵者更甚；若明知　維持生活而侵占，不加究詰，則又默許其無弊，於理更不合。夫珍　賑欵，本爲辦賑人員之應盡職責，蓋捐銀錢食物者，爲賑災，非爲賑辦賑人員，自不應爲辦賑人員而用絲毫賑欵。但與其名爲義務而實　污者，又何爲酌給相當之薪　，嚴其收支考　之爲愈。　最合宜之辦法，辦賑公費，除各售團或私人自願担任者外，從地方公欵支出，辦賑人員就地方公職人員）（黨政地方自治機關以及各公團職員之屬）中調用之。此　皆有其應得之薪給，且爲地方服務，用以救災，亦爲其應盡之職責，（如其處處要表示其爲公務人員，用以辦賑，債事有餘，成事不足，此亦應加顧慮者也。）至賑務總機關之經費以及出發辦賑之用欵，由省庫或國庫支出，庶幾各方捐助这賑欵，皆得施諸災民身上（？）也。</p>
<p>辦賑難，籌賑亦難，俗望有錢者出錢，有力者出力，以惠災黎，必其災情已引起一般之同情心，而辦賑者能得各方之信仰者也。近年以來，百業蕭條，儘多外强中乾，故募捐更難，然以災區之廣，災情之重，欵將何出，此不得不有待於各方之籌措矣，欵之來源，不外</p>
<p>（一）中央撥欵丨猶昔之動用正項發給内帑之類。</p>
<p>（二）省庫撥欵丨撥用省執及發行公債之類。</p>
<p>（三）地方公欵丨此則包括縣欵及地方一切公欵公產在内。</p>
<p>（四）抵押借欵丨此則猶如昔日之截漕留賑</p>
<p>（五）募集賑欵丨此則向各界捐募而得。</p>
<p>此五種來源，毌庸多述。惟（三）（四）兩種，尙須略加申述。辦賑以敏捷爲尙，朝三暮四，舉棋不定固不可，即遷　遲滯亦不可。是以籌欵救災，惟有切身之利害關係，或目覩災情之深刻，始能努力從事，故救災之中心，應着重在被災之本縣。縣之財力自不濟，則請各方愶助之。而應先就其所有以辦賑。現在各方多艱，縣庫無多財，自應動用地方之公欵公產。地方之公欵公產，固有集中於一處，但分寄於各方者亦不少。所謂分寄者，分寄於地方紳士之手。儘有地方公欵公產，原係辦理某種事業之用，其後事業則停頓，欵產名爲保留，一千年不還，萬年不賴一的神氣乎段，實際上無異於侵佔；及至年深月久，地方上不知有此事，則竟爲其私產，人以其爲豪紳，有明知之，亦不欲過問。此等事在各縣鄉鎭，數見不鮮。今當災重民困之候，不論何種公欵公產，均應飭令交出，集中　辦賑之用，隠匿者准人舉發，舉發者有獎。若得　集於一處，其數亦必可觀。若公產之不能立時變易錢者、好在銀行林立。正以［到鄉村去］爲其流行之口號，不妨向其抵押借欵以充賑，又如截漕救災，今已無漕可截，然如當年有漕各縣，無漕之名，仍有其實，故無論具爲變易名稱，或歸併他項，要之，皆有漕之原素在。至此刻待上救濟，旣有如久旱期中之望雨，不知何時得到，即使得賑，而調查，而編造，而呈報，而審核，而准駁，而撥欵，而支配，而放欵，到得災民身上，又不知何年何月？在高居民上者，能知民間災情之深切，不願其有紊亂秩序之行動，若搶米，若坐大户，若勒素，若滋擾·····亦不忍其憔悴以至於死亡，若流亡，若餓斃，若服毒自殺，若窒脹以死者；亦不忍見其父母妻子離散，鬻兒賣女；而一時又不能立集巨欵以放賑，則何如准各縣於其應解之糧漕欵項中酌留一二年，（今年田賦，當然要蠲免，明年有收之後，方可徵收，）並在借欵條件審核許可之制下，由各縣自行押借，以救郵斃之災民，亦不失爲一法，現在所用以救災者，大都注動在平米價，其次爲平糶，即使米價爲平，（如何平價還是問題）平糶已辦，在農村破產旱災嚴重之環境下、災民儘多無力以購買，仍然是無食吃，要餓死。又其次爲辦工賑，工賑則又在調查測量中；又即使舉辦，而工不在災區之内，是否移民以就工？再則大災之後，恒有大疫。本年旱期過長，河道乾涸，飲料大困，取水僅存池塘凄蕩之水，甚多掘泥以覓水，鑿井以求泉。取飲於是，洗濯於是，積垢叢行，事　必至。所幸雖多傷　痢疾之症，尙無大疫發生；然患者日多，日久焉知其不蔓延，思患預防，亦爲救災中應有之舉。</p>
<p>災深矣！秋收無望，來日方長，災民正彷徨於生死之界。而時序變遷。秋往冬來，又指顧問事，無衣無褐，何以卒歲！况又無食？此固深望各界同發哀憫忱，共起救濟。尤望有職責者一念及皮不存，毛正傅，飢塞生盜心；若至羣起而［喫討飯喫］喫，而呼［餓殺了］，則已補救匪易，故此非高談闊論之候也；要在急起直追，如何拯人民於塗炭。</p>
<h3 id="c208">現銀出口問題應有之認識魏友棐 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>現銀出口問題，近幾日來，頗爲　般社會所注意。批評者。討論者，以及設法制止其外流者，實繁有徒，其中持論比較過甚的甚有引起人心張皇之可能。其實現銀出口，不自今日始，而今日爲尤甚，在向來不　起注意罷。因此，在討論此問題之先，覺得要注意的並不是當前的臨時問題，而是將來的永遠的問題。　　對於此次現銀流出問題，學者問發表意見，一部分以爲制止辦法，在管理貿易入超。這個理論，在原則上是對的，可是目前的現銀的流出寘實不能歸納其原因於入超。因爲國際貿易人入超，並不是今年突起的事，而是幾十年來貿易史上的常態，今年七個月來的入超額，因國内購買力之衰落，日見减少，其數目字，則七個月總入超額爲三萬二千九百餘萬，與出口的現銀比較，相去甚遠。所以就歷年的入超而論，國際收支的差額，應該裝運出口者，宜乎不止這一些。而現在在上海出口者，却只及入超額之三分之一。</p>
<p>再就運出行家觀察。則大都是洋商銀行。國際商所得之貨欵，向來是不存華商銀行的，所以入超的結果。每天使鉅額的現銀流入洋商銀行裏去。若以本年的和累年累積的存銀，假哪悉數裝運出口，其數目定也不上一萬萬。</p>
<p>歷年流入洋商銀行的現銀、其實本同裝運出口　般，不過一個儲在上海，一個儲在外國罷了。此次裝運出口者，不外乎因貪圖滙兌上差額的利潤。由上海而搬運回國，此項現銀，久與中國市塲絶緣，所以其出口與否，與我國金融市塲出不生直接影響的。</p>
<p>當然也須承認，運出的現銀；其中不盡爲洋商銀行所自有，而也有受投機商人所委託的。投機商人爲什麽會委託代裝呢？也自然爲了國内外銀價在匯兌上比較有利潤可沾。我們所引爲憂慮的。也就是這批投機者的裝通。因爲入超上的現銀出口，是可以預計的，而這批投機者，則滙兌行市一日不平衡，其裝運即　日不止。所以縱然管理貿易入超，入超可以减退，而上項投機者仍不能使其絶跡。轊此可以說，要制止現銀外流。其辦法只　從管理銀價上着手，而不是貿易入超的問題。</p>
<p>其次現銀出口，在上海金融市塲上，並不生巨大的恐荒，般人的過慮，上海的金融會日漸枯竭，至少當不是目前的事。就以最近幾個月的上海金融市塲拆息來看，查六月份拆息的平均是六分，七月份也是六分；再查八月一日至十六日止者是七分，十七日日到十九日是八分，有日漸高漲的趨勢，自　十日起至二十六日止，可以看到起落的趨勢：</p>
<p>八月二十日　一○分　二十四日　一五分二十一日　一一分　二十五日　一○分二十二日　一三分　二十六日　七分二十三日　一三分</p>
<p>拆息到一角，雖爲本年所僅見，其中尤以二十四日的一角五分，爲本年的最高峯，可是在平年比較得來，就覺得市塲上並不視爲若何嚴重狀態的。其中二十一日起的漲高，又有一特殊原因，爲五華實業銀行倒閉，恐慌餘氣所震盪之故。至於二十四日的突漲，則純爲報紙用大號字登載白銀出口問題，人心激發使然，所以從二十五日起，又逐漸下落了。市塲在這存底减少的時候，其所以不致受劇烈的影響者；則不得不歸功於紙幣之流通了。</p>
<p>國際貿易收支平衡，固然可以减少現銀的流出；但當前的着目點，應該是如何設法提昌國内銀價，制止投機問點，否則即使在出超地位，而現銀的流出恐怕仍是不能制止，現銀的大量量出，在上海金融上一時雖不見發生若何影響，但過事投機結果，當然要牽動到存銀問題，照滙兌上的作用，兩地匯兌價格有差額，如果互爲賣買，則其價目平。但世界的貨幣戰爭一日不止，匯兌上的差額就永不能平衡。則如何設法提高國内銀價，就成爲這個問題的中心了。</p>

<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>傷寒論辨脈法云。［士口脈浮而緊。浮則爲風。緊則爲寒。風則傷衛。寒則傷榮。榮衛兩傷。骨節煩疼。當發其汗也。］此爲說太陽篇者三綱鼎立之所自。朱奉議曰。［桂枝主傷衛。麻黃土傷榮。大青龍主榮衛具傷也。］此爲太陽篇三綱鼎立之始。嗣後許學士因之。至方中行傷寒論條辨。遂分太陽篇爲上中下三篇。而以風傷衛爲上篇。寒傷榮爲中篇。榮衛俱傷爲下篇。喻嘉言襲其說而作尙論篇。魏荔彤因之而作傷寒論本義。後之說傷寒論者。多以風傷衛。寒傷榮。風寒雨傷榮衛。三綱鼎立。爲不祧之法。欲知其謬。不可不自認榮衛始。</p>
<p>靈樞營衛生會篇曰。清者爲營。濁者爲衛。營在脈中。衛在脈外。］又曰。［營出於中焦。衛生於下焦。］又曰。［中焦亦並胃中出上焦之後。此所受氣者。泌糟粕。蒸津液。化其精微。上注於肺脈。乃化而爲血。以奉生身。莫貴於此。故獨得行於經隧。命曰營氣］。由此觀这。營者血也。血遇寒則凝。凍傷凍瘳之類是也。是寒傷營之說似有據矣。然凍傷凍瘃之病。絶不類太陽篇傷寒。若欲牽强附會之。則凍傷之爲病。未始無脈緊惡寒之候。然此外如嗜眠。如行步蹣跚，等證。非太陽傷寒所有。且必待空氣温度降至攝氏零下十餘度。始能發生，在南方極不易覯。安能如仲景所說。宗族死亡。三分之二皆爲此病耶。此必如秦皇主所說。仲景爲河北南陽之人。傷寒爲北方冬月之病。而後始可附會。而秦氏之說。世補齋已闢其謬。然則凍傷之與太陽篇傷寒。如風馬牛之不相涉。明矣。太陽傷寒之非寒傷營。亦明矣。</p>
<p>至於衛。至今尙不知爲何物。以内經濁者爲衛之說觀之。則身體中無用之廢物也。以衛生下焦之說觀之。則膀胱之小便也。蓋靈樞生會篇有曰。［下焦者。别𢌞腸。注於膀胱。而滲入焉。］此卽吾以衛爲小便之證也。小便在身爲廢物。亦與濁者爲衛之說合。又以衛行脈外之說觀之。凡人身之中。其網絡之徑路。與脈管相似者。爲神經。爲淋巴管。然神經不得謂之濁。且神經受傷。則必有疼痛麻痺之候。而太陽傷寒無之。故衛之非神經。可以確定矣。然則衛者。淋巴也。淋巴液者何。以廣義言之。血管以外之體液也。凡組織細胞間之液體。而不爲脈道所包圍。不行經隊之中者。皆得謂之淋巴。腦脊管之液。心囊中之液。皆與焉。然此二者不得謂之濁。且此二者。受傷必發腦脊膜炎證候及心囊炎證候。蓋其液之變化。實受腦脊膜炎心囊炎之影響。在被動之地位。非自能發病也。故所謂衛者。非廣義之淋巴矣。然則衛也者。其狹義之淋巴。乃組織細胞間及淋巴管中之淋巴液乎。</p>
<p>考淋巴液。充滿於組織細胞間隙之中。爲血液與組織細胞間新陳代謝之媒介。而其由來。則仍自脈管也。自毛細脈管滲漏液體。出於脈管之外。入於組織細胞之間。是爲淋巴。故淋巴之組合成分。與血漿大略相同。其與血液非有特異之點也。組織細胞間之淋巴。來自血液。又還被脈管所吸收。其不及吸收之餘瀋。則流入於分布組織細胞間之細小淋巴管。由細淋巴管而流入大淋巴管。由大淋巴管而流入大靜脈管。又與血液混合矣。淋巴之出自脈管出。挾帶營養成而來。其還入脈管及别向細淋巴管而流也。挾帶老廢物而去。所謂濁也。然其結果。一部分仍還入血管。一部份雖别經淋巴管。而終亦入於血管。則此而受傷。卽營血受傷也。豈得别營血之傷而獨立哉。</p>

<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>惟有庸醫始殺人</p>
<p>良醫抱道志存仁</p>
<p>法庭能勿聽誣告</p>
<p>從此醫林可息紛</p>
<p>世風日下，人心愈險，醫病糾紛，日甚一日，法庭對薄，已成慣見，而一究其内容，病家之控醫者，無論其事實如何，岡不曰庸醫殺人，夫醫而曰庸，言其學識人格之舉不足以勝任也，其殺人也固宜，至若本非庸醫，學校承認其學識，國家承認其資格，社會承認其信用，而謂其自蹈殺人之嫌，無是理也，故正式醫師之絶不至於殺人，亦獨庸醫之必至於殺人也。今之被控於病家者，果皆爲庸醫乎？現於每於控案終結，勝訴多屬於醫家，卽可見被控者之非庸醫，而爲無辜受累者矣。執此以言，法院於受理此種案件之先，似宜詳細調查，果屬正式醫師，卽當在不受理之列，蓋旣爲正式醫師則根本無被控之可能也。</p>
<p>茲請言正式醫師無被控可能之理由：</p>
<p>（一）正式醫師，出身於正式醫校，受高深敎育之熏陶，其人格學識已有相當之修養，一切誇大欺騙之事，决不肯爲。其行道也不借廣告爲吸收病人之資而病人自至，孔子曰：［君子學以致其道］，正式醫師亦然，學以致病人，致者莫之求而自至也。夫醫不招徠而病人自至，卽其結果欠佳，則其責任似不得專由醫家負之明矣。若夫江湖庸醫則不然，誇大其廣告，低廉其診金，病人之至也，惑於宣傳之辭，本非出於自動，則如有錯誤，自當負法律上之責任，而法院於此尤當重科而嚴罰之也。</p>
<p>（二）正式醫師旣具充分之學術，復具豐富之經騐，病人之就診者，應絶對服從之，蓋其診斷治療，舉非病家之所可得而討論；且病情萬變，醫家無百病皆可治愈之可能，以一毫無醫學常識之病家而動言醫家診斷之不確，治療之誤施，不知其果何所據而云然也。卽使詢之其他醫者，然而事過境遷，其所推測，究難如當時診治者視察之確實，故病家而欲討論醫家診療之當否，以爲訴訟之根據，是獨夏虫語氷，强不知以爲知者也。至於江湖庸醫，本無學問，其診斷治療，當多錯誤，偶然治愈亦屬天幸，其不愈者，類多出於錯誤也無疑。病家於此，固宜控之訴之，未可與正式醫師同日而語也。</p>
<p>（三）正式醫師其名譽非一日之所能得，故其診病之際，每出以極端審愼之態度，决不肯稍存輕忽之意於其間。今之控醫家者每曰故意殺人，夫醫家與病人何仇而必故意殺之，醫家又與自己難得易失之令譽何仇，而必故意毁壞之，此故意殺人一語之不通於此可見。夫醫者治病，本無故意之過失可言，卽或偶有不幸，亦屬出於無意，所謂學理上問題，而非法律上之問題。故正式醫師不當負刑事上之責任也。至於江湖庸醫，惟利是圖，罔識廉恥，殺嬰堕胎，任意爲之，病家對之絶難任其逍遙於法外也。</p>
<p>（四）夫生命無代價，正式醫師活人萬千，其功績昭著於人世，卽有一二偶然之無意錯誤，而功罪相抵，亦覺功大罪微，社會輿論亦當明白此義，今之要求民事賠償者，動以死者之身價爲此例，（如死者每年能賺一千元以尙能活十年之計算要求醫者賠償一萬元之類）然則病人之經醫師治愈者，醫師亦何不有同樣之要求乎！今病者於醫家應得之診金，尙靳而不與，而一死之後，詎欲其千萬鉅額爲要挾之資，此豈事理之平者耶？由是言之，醫家不當負民事上之賠償明矣。至於以歛財爲旨之江湖庸醫，如遇此等事件之發生，則非科以重金不可，蓋不如此，則不能稍戢其巧詐之心，而收懲一警百之效也。</p>
<p>（五）醫家有保持病人之權。其視病人。如物之爲已有。除正式會診外。絶對不容有第三者之加入。蓋不如是不足以言治療上之負責。徵之文明先進國家莫不然也。獨在吾國。則情形特異。病人之就醫也。或朝張而暮李。或昨中而今西。或表面則新醫診治。暗中則舊醫主持。新舊並用。中西雜投。凡此情形。實難縷述。及至病情變化。乃欲新醫家負完全責任。吾不知其責任之從何負也。故今日中國之新醫。實無負法律上任何責任之可能。然而被控累累者亦云寃矣。</p>
<p>總之醫病糾紛。其故非一。而法院之輕於受理。啟病家輕於嘗試之心。其要因也。吾深望法院於受理之前。先向醫團調查被控者是否爲正式醫師。如爲正式醫師。自應將原訴駁回。拒絶受理。如是則誣告無門。糾紛自息。而醫業亦得所保障矣。企予望之！</p>
<h3 id="c222">兒童牙齒之防護法（下） <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>成人牙第一護大臼齒最應保</p>
<p>從上更成人牙生齒時期表中。可見第一大臼齒之出。約五歲至七歲之間。此牙最關重要。因其爲齒槽弓之柱石。此牙若失。其鄰牙易至貨斜而成爲咬合不正。届成人時。頦部退縮。而部失其端正。牙齒排列不整。且易蛀壞。爲父母者。每誤認此牙爲暫時之乳牙。任其蝕蛀。而致將來全部牙齒受影響。殊不惜也。故宜時常留心此牙之出現。而加以保護。此牙一出。其他成人牙卽將次第出現矣。</p>
<p>如何預防牙蛀</p>
<p>預防牙蛀可歸納於下列四項述之</p>
<p>（一）良習之養成　母親之於小兒。未生牙時。應每日用消毒藥水。洗抹其口腔。初生牙時。應時當用清潔之濕布。擦去其牙污。至四五歲時。則應授以一毛頭柔軟細潔之小牙刷。敎以刷牙方法</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>。使其自行洗刷。凡此皆所以訓練兒童。使養成口腔清潔之良好習慣。此習旣成。終身不懈。而牙齒自不易壞。故此良習之養成。實爲預防牙患之最初有效方法也。</p>
<p>（二）合理的刷牙方法　先用牙刷浸入温開水内。然後置牙粉或牙膏於其上。刷時内外兩面均須刷到。裏部尤宜多刷。刷牙之動作。須上下縱刷。或成圓形轉動。使牙縫内之污物。一掃而清。普通刷牙。多向左右横刷。或僅刷外面。或僅刷前部。因此污物不易刷去。易生牙患。</p>
<p>每日早晨及三餐後。刷牙一次。最少限度。須每日二次。卽早晨一次。晚餐後一次。小兒喜食糖菓。因糖質易發酸而損牙磁。最好能减少其小吃。或吃後立卽洗牙。使口内無殘餘食物以害齒。</p>
<p>（三）選擇有益之食物　食物於牙齒健全。極有關係。强健之牙齒。全持有益之食物以造成之。爲母者。在孕時卽宜擇富有石灰質之食物。如牛乳雞蛋青菜橘子粗米（米之過白者不宜）等食之。俾兒童之齒牙。得以堅强。小兒在生長時期。應多食富於各種維他命之食物。如蛋黃牛奶魚肝油橘子青菜等。尤有益於牙齒。</p>
<p>（四）按時請牙醫檢查　小孩換牙時期。大約七年（請注意換牙時期表）。在此七年中。最好每隔半年。請牙醫生檢查一次。有患卽治。有垢卽用手術洗刮。免致乳牙早期失落。如覺乳牙搖動時。則須立卽㧞去。否則成人牙由前面或後面生出。排列不齊。換牙後在相當時期内。亦必須請牙醫生檢查口腔或洗牙。</p>
<p>請牙醫按照檢查口腔。有患卽治。實爲最經濟之辦法。譬如甲乙二人。甲每年按時請牙醫檢查。而乙則聽其自然。結果甲之口腔清潔。齒牙完好。而乙則牙患叢生。痛苦異常。因蝕蛀化膿而㧞去之牙甚多。勢必裝鑲假牙。其所受之痛苦。所費之金錢時間。數倍於甲。故按時檢查口腔。實爲預防牙患之一要着也。</p>
<p>齒牙對於身體康健之影響</p>
<p>凡有常識之人。皆知食物必須反覆細嚼。方易消化。若齒牙失落。不能咀嚼自然。則食物必不能充分吸收同化而裨益身體。食一倍之物。僅得半倍　效。消化不良。安望其能康健。</p>
<p>病齒或齒髓已死之蛀牙。皆可發生傳染病灶（ＦｏｃｕｓｏｆＩｎｆｅｃｔｉｏｎ）。而减低身體之抵抗力。引起各種疾病。例如竇炎肺炎關節炎胸膜炎腦膜炎心膜炎骨膜炎闌尾炎肺病耳聾癲狂等疾病。頗多由蛀牙之膿毒由血管或食道流入身體各部所致也。且口腔乃食物必經之要道。無論其食物如何清潔。若經過滿口蛀牙飽藏微菌污垢之口腔。决不能保存原有之清潔衛生。故齒牙對於健康。關係實大。</p>
<p>齒科預防學之貢獻</p>
<p>齒科學對於社會之最大貢獻。不在於治療學（ＳｕｒｇｉｃａｌＤｅｎｔｉｓｔｒｙ）不在於補學（Ｒｅ－ＰａｒａｔｉｖｅＤｅｎｔｉｓｔｒｙ）。而在於預防學（ＰｒｅｖｅｎｔｉｖｅＤｅｎｔｉｓｔｒｙ）。預防</p>
<p>學者卽講求如何使人類避免牙患之學術也。此爲齒科中最進步最有價値之學。各國學者莫不注力於此。此學昌明。人類齒牙健全。其他二者全可取消。美國牙醫生馮斯氏爲預防學實行之最力而最久者。其病人記錄中。頗多昔年之兒童顧客。今皆成爲容貌端正齒牙健全之青年。毫無蛀洞。毫無補嵌。离受康寗快樂。</p>
<p>故預防學之造福社會。確有實據。各國牙醫界早知兒童口腔衛生之重要。爲父母者近亦知其重要。故每能與牙齒生合作。按時請益。聽其指導。從事防護。而子女乃能終身受惠。吾國之爲父母者。若非逼於子女牙痛。鮮有携之往牙醫處者。其不去之原因。不外（一）不明瞭預防之重要。（二）省一筆診費。（三）恐子女畏懼啼哭多一筆麻煩（其實父母若能與以良好暗示。俾知牙醫生並不使伊痛苦。反能使伊牙齒美觀。免除牙痛。則子女鮮有不樂從者）。吾敢掬誠爲國人告曰。將來子女因牙齒不健全所受之精神時間金錢種種損失。其代價實百十倍於現時之診費。國人乎。與其費多力以治理成人。毌寗費少力以養成健童。</p>
<h3 id="c223">肺結核淺說（十九） <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>肺結核症開始的情形，大多數是這樣潛伏的；他的經過，也是很慢性的，三五年固不用說得，二三十年之久，也是狠平常的。除開這種外，他有時也可以［急性開始］的，但比較係少數。這一種係在最初就會突然温度增高的，同時也兼有頭痛四肢疼痛這一類主觀症象；這種情形，和流行感冒症狠類似的。如果我們行精密的檢查手續了；聽診打診方面是沒有什麽的，但在他的清晨痰唾裏面，是可以發現結核菌的，就是愛克司光的攝影，也可以看出他的浸潤狀態的。</p>
<p>在本症急性開始的當中，頂顯著的總要算乾酪性肺炎一症了！他是突然被生高熱和全身沉動狀態的，並且大多數是陷於不治的；這一種外表症象，幾乎和急性傳染病是差不多的。此外還有一種型式，他的病灶雖非乾酪肺炎性，但他的病勢蔓延是非常快速，外表症象也是相彷彿的；這就是尋常的［奔馬性肺癆］了。這二種型式的經過情形，和前面的慢性是完全不同；他的預後是非常惡劣的，就是一般醫家聽見，也是談虎色變而無所着手的。</p>
<p>肺結核症的開始情形，上面已經講過了。關於他的一般重要症象，像盜汗咳欶咳血呼吸困難温度等種種，現在且一一的分述在下面：</p>
<p>（一）盜汗　尋常的肺結核病人，大多數在晚間温度是增高的，到了半夜或清晨，在他的温度下降的時候，是會發生過量的汗的，這一種症象，是可以侵擾病人的安眠，消耗病人體力的。此外，在本病的最初時期，也會發生的；這在老練的醫家，當然不肯輕易放過的。但是我們要曉得，像因過度刺激而失眠，精神煩擾，多夢，這一類的神經性原因；也可以同樣發生的。這當然不能混雜在一起的。</p>
<p>（二）消瘦　這是對病家的一個警告。尋常的人們，如果無緣無故地身體逐漸消瘦了，雖不能說一定是肺結核症，但至少可以說：精密的肺部檢查工作，是免不了的。他發生原因，大概是食慾不佳而體重减少所致；物質交換機能的上昇也免不了有關係的，在平常有熱度的病人因不用說得，就是沒有温度增高現象的，像這樣的例，也有百分三十以上之數計的。這一種症象的發生，並不是本病已經惡劣化了。在事實上所告訴我們的，有時剛七是相反的；就是：在營養狀態良好的人們。他的肺部侵壞。是很容易擴大的；而瘦弱者所患的本病，大多數反而易發生硬變性變化，預後也比較良好的。</p>
<p>（三）貧血　尋常患本病的人們，總帶着一點蒼白的顏色的：假使患者是個婦女，很容易和萎黃病混雜的。但事實上並不盡然的。不錯，本病的患者紅血球數目和血色素成分，可時也可以减少，和萎黃病一樣的；但大多數是在病勢前進的時候如此的，平常並沒有這樣顯着變化的。就是由血球和淋巴性白血球的數量增加也是如此的。這二方面的鑑别，當然是需要精密的血液檢查方可水落石出的　關於個中的詳情，只好留在臨床檢查法一章裏面另述了！</p>
<p>（四）咳嗽　咳嗽是肺結核症重要症象之一，［久咳易成癆］一句話，幾乎成了一般人的口頭禪了。在我們診病的時候，因患咳嗽就診的病人們，結果發生結核性的病灶固屬不少；就是病家自身，有時覺得咳得太久了，出怕係帶結核性原因的，其中特未求診視的人們，數量也是很多的。這一種情形，我們可以曉得，一般人對此症象是非常普遍重視的，在本病最初開始的時候，許多人係不發生咳嗽的，就使有了，大多數也是受外界侵襲的關係，像塵埃，煤灰，長時間的高聲談話，都是可能的；和結核病本身大致係無關的。到了他發生乾咳了，甚至帶痙攣性了，這是大多數由乾性胸膜炎或喉頭炎構成的。肺結核本身發生咳嗽，大半係因痰唾剩留在氣管裏面；我們曉得，氣管裏面有一種顫毛，係專司排痰工作的，這樣一來，病者當然是非咳不行了。這種情形，許多患者係沒有間斷的，但有些人係特殊在每天晨晚發生劇咳的。此外還有一事，也應該提出的，就是：在病勢前進蔓延的時候，有時可完全不發生咳嗽的，這當然是狠稀有的。作者記得從前曾診過一個病人，他痰唾裏面的結核菌是很多的，這當然是開放性肺癆無疑了；在受克司光的攝影方面，除下葉一部分外，幾乎是全肺部初侵潤的。這一種情形，當然不用說得，是非常嚴重的，但他是完全沒有咳嗽症象的。據此一點，讀者們已可推想，肺結核的症象，是如何繁雜而無定型的了。</p>
<h3 id="c224">種痘閒話（續） <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 臧荷百</p>
<p>還有現在掛老法牛痘招牌的先生們，他們並不保存國粹：不用人漿，就用我輩所用的牛痘苗。所不同的。不過在兩臂上。多種幾粒而已，要知道種痘後所得免疫性。一粒可得，十料亦得，他們的程度。並沒有高下。在這些種老法牛痘先生們襲用牛痘苗的行爲，在道德上，雖然有點說不過去。在事實上，我到特别的歡迎的，爲什麽呢？因爲牛痘苗，消毒過的，果沒有過他的有效時間，放心大膽用去，沒有弊害，人漿的話，則難問了，不過我覺得除掉襲用牛痘苗之外，何不再襲用襲用一般消毒法，豈不更臻上乘麽？</p>
<p>在種痘的時候，社會上常遇着的，還有［吃發物］和［忌口］的兩椿事，在老法種痘先生們，也認爲是很要緊的，其實免疫性的產生和消失，絶不關乎飲食的攝取與否，假使有關，不必要種痘來催進生花免疫性的產生；吃點發物好了！忌口忌得很厲害的人們，天花免疫性，就永不會消失的嗎？並且事實告訴我們：種痘以後，隨物而食，事前旣不吃發物，事後又不忌口，果係體内免疫性消失掉了，初種和再種的情形，沒有分别。</p>
<p>紅色光綫，在經騐上，對於天然痘（卽人花發疹），是有利的，然而對於人工痘（卽所種的痘）則無所謂也！而社會一般人們於種痘的小孩子頭上，纏繞許多紅布，呌做頂紅，還有着紅色衫褲的，這亦可不必多此一舉。</p>
<p>天花的預防，我們大多數人都曉得；只有種痘這一椿事能够來辦到，我就不曉得在一個天花流行的區域内，家家門口貼着寸把寬三四寸長的［天花已過］的紅紙條，和小孩子身上訂着同樣的紅布條的動作有什麽用處？就是說紅色光綫是殺滅天花病原（現時尙未發見）的惟一利器，我們閉起眼睛來想一想：這麽大的房屋，這麽大的小孩子，用這麽大的紙條兒，布條兒，就能够和神出鬼沒的天花病原來隔離麽？他的操作就是這樣簡陋嗎？所期的目的，就能夠達到嗎？</p>
<p>一般人們種痘的時候，歡迎種痘先生們代他們的子女，要種出血來，方纔快樂，這一層，又是不對的！因爲我們種痘，只要把極薄的一層表皮切破，把所上的漿苗得由破口吸收進去，就好了，漿苗能由破口進去，當時破口的地方，一定要能營吸的作用，在科學方面說，就是要那個地方要生陰壓，假使那個地方流血，不是營吸的作用，是呼的作用，是陽壓，豈不與上漿的本意有悖嗎？</p>
<p>春夏秋冬四季，對於　　，沒有什麽關侮，不過因爲夏天氣候　，漿苗效力容易消失；冬天氣候　，種痘的人脫衣，容易受感冒；春秋天氣候，不凉不暖，沒有這些弊害，所以相宜；社會上單相信在春天種痘，不相信在秋天種痘，也是錯誤的！</p>
<p>小孩子生下來八十天，就能夠種痘的，還有在天花流行得很厲害的時候，片下來七天的時候，就要代他種痘子，一般人說：小孩子五臟沒有長全，要等到一兩週歲以後，纔能給他種痘的話，更是無理！因爲小孩子生下來五臟就全備的，而且天花免疫性的產生，關係五臟全不全的什麽？</p>

<p>本病的發生。就是在患腺窩性扁桃腺炎的時候。如果體温下降和局部疼痛消散以後。忽然惡寒單慄。熱度再昇。病人感覺患側的扁桃腺部。特别的劇痛。（大都祗限於一側。生於兩側的很少）。疼痛時常可以放散到耳部。嚥下的動作。很爲困難。飲食的時候。流質常可倒流。而從鼻腔流出。疼痛若更劇烈。那就完全不能嚥下。就是嚥下幾滴水。病人也認爲一件痛苦的事件。病人的精神。非常過敏。容易忿怒。夜眠也就不安。言語也感不便。醫師檢查咽腔的時候。病人常因開口運動的困難。和他的痛苦。往往不願開口。如果勉强忍痛開口。或用開口器開口時。則見患側的口蓋了。高度發赤腫脹。有時波及軟口蓋。口蓋扁桃腺亦著明潮紅。若用消息子（探針）接觸腫脹部。則覺硬固而有抵抗。同時病人感覺壓痛。此時稱爲遍桃腺周圍炎Ｐｅｒｉｔｏｎｏｉｌｌｉｔｉｓ。這等病象如果繼續一二天。腫脹部就可變軟而有波動。這是因爲膿潰的緣故。此時稱爲扁桃腺周圍膿瘍Ｐｅｒｉｔｏｎｓｉｌｌａｒａｂｓｚｅｓｓ病人在這個時候。痛苦最甚。自恨自怨。坐臥不定。頭頸多呈傾斜狀態。膿瘍的附近部。多現炎性的服腫。懸壅垂（小舌頭）和健側的口蓋了。亦常腫大。</p>
<p>講到本病的治療方法。最好在患腺窩性扁桃腺炎的時候。施行適宜的治療。早早預防扁桃腺周圍炎的發生。旣經有了周圍炎。那就應當繼續屢行藥物塗布法。含漱法。和罩包法。如果疼痛難堪。已有波動的時候。那就一定要施行手術。切開排膿。疼痛就可自止。病人頓覺輕快。經過兩三天。卽能全愈。恢復健康。</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第一回　鬼載一車關中來遠客家徒四壁渡口吊秦人</p>
<p>他拿着撣柄，週身上下，亂擈了一陣，撲得身上烟霧騰騰，白光裏一遍灰塵。這時那房子廊檐下面，有個穿西服的人，只向他們看。見茶房端了臉水向這邊房間裏送，他便笑道：你們生意眞好，這後面一排房子，今天又住滿了。李士廉聽他說話，也是南方人口音，分明也是個作客的。他這回來，覺得身到異地，以［逢到菩薩就拜］的主義，最爲適用。作官的人，只要多認得朋友，總有辦法。於是他趁了這個機會，也就挿言道：西安這個地方，旅館生意，倒是這樣好。說着，向那人笑着點了個頭。那人自也不便坦然受之，隨着也就點頭還禮。李士廉這就跟着向前逼進一步，哈着腰兒笑道：這位先生也是南邊口音，貴姓是？那人見他如此客氣，却也不便過於拒絶，便笑着說是江蘇人，呌程志前丨是到這裏來考察敎育的，自己是個中學校的敎員。李土廉聽他說是個來考察敎育的，這種人和他聯絡與否，倒並沒有什麽關係。所以說話到這裏爲止。他自向房間裏去收拾行李，不再和程志前，談交情了。這時，已到下午四點多鐘，洗洗臉，向旅館裏要點東西吃，天色也就昏暗了。可是這裏第一件事讓他不快的，就是茶房在這昏暗的空氣中，捧了一盞高脚煤油燈進來。燈放在桌上這屋子裏白色的板壁，似乎都帶些昏黃的顏色。李士廉今年三十六歲，從二十歲起，就沒有度過點油燈的生活，現在猛然看到，說不出來，心裏有一種怎樣的煩悶。正感到十分無聊（一○）</p>

<p>— 李葵</p>
<p>這幾位抗日的英雄，沒有馬占山，蔡廷鍇那些抗日的英雄有名；所以才呌他們爲無名英雄。</p>
<p>但是他們的勇敢，他們的犧牲精神，確實比那些有名的英雄還値得敬佩。</p>
<p>我現在就講講這個故事：是在九一八以後，日本已經佔領了遼寗，吉林和黑龍江一部分：只是還沒有佔領哈爾濱。</p>
<p>當日本攻打哈爾濱的時候，丁超的兵是抵抗的；所以在馬家溝地方，發生了很慘烈的激戰。</p>
<p>打了一天一夜，丁超的兵終於是敗了！因爲日本在天空有飛機投炸彈，在地上有坦克車向前硬衝！他們的軍備很可憐，旣沒有高射砲，又沒有挖戰壕；所以他們只是節節退讓。</p>
<p>可是，有幾個兵士已經被追得跑不開了，眼看就要死在機關槍下了！他們看看跑也是死，就馬上回過頭來和敵人死拚了！有的横躺在坦克車前，阻止坦克軍前進；有的用槍刺了從槍眼挿進去亂衝。</p>
<p>這時他們又打死了一半：可是他們還拚命的跟敵人肉搏！終於是把坦克車裏的敵人衝死了。得了這架坦克車。</p>
<p>這幾位抗日的英雄，眞是使人敬佩；並且可以留名在抗日史上；可是他們是無名英雄！</p>
<p>我想他們無名的緣故，就是因爲他們的功績，是建築在自己的鮮血上，而不是建築在别人的骷髏上的。</p>

<p>靠天吃飯的中國農民，在這亢旱酷暑的年頭，已經望穿了兩眼。五岳四瀆，名山大川的神祗，已完全失了靈騐。報荒，逃荒，乞賑，搶米的消息，裝滿了新聞的篇幅。科學方法的人工致雨術也還是個遠水不救近火。於無可如何之中，做些設壇，建醮，禁屠，祈雨等至老把戲，也只是個呼天不應，喚地不靈，慰情聊勝而已。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>如其有人家的祖墳，恰巧就落在鐵路的近旁，那末這幾天裏，因爲知道太后快要在這裏經過了，必不敢走來掃墓。丨但我們打車窗裏看過去，還是很清楚的：他們却一齊背轉了身子，不敢向我們正眼相看，因爲這也是當地的官吏，已曾很普遍地警戒過他們的緣故。不過，我可以斷然的說：他們確沒有遵守這項匿條！本來，好奇心是人人所必具的，老百姓終年只聽人說，皇上，皇太后，但皇上或皇太后究竟是怎樣的一尊神佛，或一個人，他們都不曾見過，難得逢到我們這一列御用火車，載着皇太后和皇上在他們面前經過，他們當然斷不願再錯掉這個機會，於是他們便借着向祖墓跪拜的姿勢，把他們的腦袋低下來，張大了眸子，竭力從脅下偷看着：然而他們至多也只能見到這一列黃色的火車，和車上蠕蠕地在行動的許多人影，皇太后和皇上的眞相，還是看不見。</p>
<p>對於清明掃墓的這一種風俗，我也曾和太后作過一番很値得紀念的討論，彼此都有相同的感想；如其要記錄起來的話，又是很長的一篇。</p>
<p>我們所經過的這一段路程中，軌道兩旁，差不多全是墳墓，因此在這一天上，掃墓的人，端的是絡繹不絶。太后憑着車窗，向他們很出神地瞧着；同時伊的臉上，透着一重思慮沉沉的淡灰色，雙眉也攅到了一處來。伊每逢在思索什麽事情的當兒，態度總是非常的憂鬰愁悶，這時候，無論什麽有興味的事情發生，伊也决不會笑的。（一一九）</p>
<p>在我們下級大衆的［萬有神論］哲理觀之下，致雨的神明和求雨的方術本是不一而足。下面幾章擬古畫虎的求雨咒，雖然帶着些詰問的不遜口吻，却也可以代表下民怨悱焦切的情緒：</p>

<p>高興的時候，約一個小朋友，各人拿出瓦盆，把兩隻蟋蟀放在一盆，張牙舞翅，鬩牆戰鬥，自相殘殺，勝的耀武揚威，自逞英豪，鼓翅高鳴，逗得不朋友拍手歡笑。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，倒想起了一件趣事，故鄉二個青年同時追逐一個少女，但是這少女的婚姻，是在兩可之間，不論那一個都好，因爲兩少年甲也急切地問伊屬誰？乙也急切地問伊屬誰？急得伊不知答應那個好，幸而伊有急智，說：你們兩人拿蟋蟀來博取吧！看誰勝？那時已在深秋天氣，乙化了五百元的代價去買了一隻上過戰塲的將軍，甲也挑選了一隻善戰的英雄，請了證人，評判員，一塲大戰，結果，伊是屬了某乙，甲氣得身子發顫，連瓦盆英雄都摔在地上。</p>

<p>— 南宫生</p>
<p>畫舫是一種游湖的小船，佈置得很是精雅，比了尋常載貨運物的貨船，大不相同，因這種畫舫，大都是在有名勝而水道多的湖渚之中，專作爲游人游玩水雲鄉中的風景區所用，所以船上的佈置一切，都不須合於實用，只要精緻風雅，合於游人的心意。</p>
<p>我國各地的風景，山水的清麗，不亞於世界公園瑞士，尤其是水雲鄉中，可稱爲别有天地。泛舟一葉，頓覺得萬愁皆滌，異常的身心舒泰，畫舫便因了這種需要，發現於各地水雲鄉中了。所以如蘇州丨無錫，彷佛是意大利的水城威尼斯，各處可以瞧見漪綠而浩淼的清波，不論到什麽名勝的地方丨似玄墓山丨天平山丨虎邱山丨石湖丨惠泉山丨梅園丨太湖等；最便利的，便是由水道通行，畫舫便成了游人最適宜的恩物。其餘如杭州西湖丨揚州瘦西湖丨濟南大明湖丨等勝地，最妙的游區，都在綠水清波之中，自然畫舫也成了必需的物件了。所以在這些勝地，到處可以見到三數知己，載浮載沉的在一隻美麗的畫舫之中，放乎中流，其樂也陶陶，使你感覺到無上的欣慕。可是各地的畫舫，因了水道的大小，環境的不同，畫舫的佈置式樣，也完全不是一樣。</p>
<p>蘇州的畫舫，因須航行在闊而且深的胥江等河内，所以比較别地丨除掉了無錫丨是大一些。最大的有十丈長以外，丈多闊的面積，分船頭丨船梢丨船艙三部，船艙内大的還分爲三間或兩間，四面都排列着很精緻而雕刻甚細的活絡花窗，全船都用色澤美麗的廣漆原漆漆得光亮而華美，艙内的榻牀和椅子桌子，好的都是紅木所製。船梢上有兩支長櫓，這便是行舟唯一的利器，煮菜的行竃，也在梢上。船頭上却祇有定重心的石磴兩個，上面架的船蓬，也是用木料所製成，撑船的竹篙，便横在頂上。其餘船艙門所用的門帘和窗帘，也都是用很美麗的料子做成，所以全船沒一處不合着美麗而雅緻的條件。</p>
<p>無錫的畫舫，同蘇州的却彷佛一般，不過比較了又稍稍大些，這出是因了要到太湖邊上去的緣故，不得不再大一些，内容佈置，也同蘇州一樣。船上最著名的丨同蘇州兩處在畫舫上丨便是精美的船萊，到如今，依舊膾炙人口，稱道弗衰的。</p>
<p>西湖的畫舫，却不同蘇錫兩地，船的容積也小，船艙上張着雪白的布篷，四周有的圍着銅的欄杆，非凡的清雅。艙内排着籐椅和籐桌，供給游客憇坐之用，船梢上祇有一支行舟的木櫓。在清風明月之夜，同了二三知己，泛乎中流，此情此景，眞賽加天上神仙了。船中却沒有菜肴，著名的便是杭州的清泉和龍井茶葉。揚州瘦西湖的畫舫，同西湖的倒十分相像，不過搖船的舟子，却多十五六歲的女子，這兩處的畫舫，只作遊湖之用，不能如蘇錫兩地的畫舫，可以航行在大河深潭之中，又可以作爲安息的所在。</p>
<p>大明湖的畫舫，最是奋怪，沒有船頭，好似一支畫舫，斬斷了個船頭，船艙的凉篷，是用木架張着帆布，艙内佈置，也只有籐椅桌子。船梢上沒有船櫓和槳。行舟唯一的東西，却是兩枝樹幹，此了蘇錫西湖等地的畫舫，佈置最是簡陋，可是大明湖水泡的雨前茶，却可以媲美於西湖虎跑和龍井，這是最値得留戀的一事。</p>
<p>除了以上的幾處之外，尙有秦淮畫舫丨江山船，廣州河艇等多種，却不只以畫舫見重於時，因船上所有的舟子，都是些妙齡女郎，很含一些神秘作用，所以名氣，也非凡的偉大，這是醉翁之意不在酒了。</p>

<p>— 素</p>
<p>最近一月來，報紙上紛紛登載比國科學家考新斯作同温層探騐的消息據說他乘輕氣球上昇達一萬六千公尺，逗留空中歷十五小時之久，結果很爲滿意云云。究竟什麽呌做同温層？應該如何去探騐？讀者或有不大明瞭的，現在簡單解釋一下：</p>
<p>我們知道，環繞地球四周的都是空氣，普通的經騐，離開地面愈高的地方，空氣的温度也愈低，但達到某一定的高度後，雖更上昇，温度並不再降，儼然將空氣劃成上下兩層，下層呌做對流層，在這層的空氣，他的温度向上低减極快。上層呌做同温層，空氣的温度，却不因高下而有差别。至於同温層的高度，因地而異，在北緯五十度，約七英里，在赤道上，約十英里，在南北極，僅僅五英里左右。</p>
<p>近來各國科學家，對於同温層的探騐，極爲注意，想了種種方法，探求同温層的特種現象，他們普通所用的工具都依賴輕氣球，氣球有大小兩種，大的呌做測量氣球，中間裝置著極精巧的氣象儀，昇入高空後，人在裏面可以測得同温層的氣壓温度和濕度。小的呌做探風氣球，直徑不過二十英寸左右，構造比較簡單，各國氣象臺每天都有施放。</p>
<p>乘人汽球（測量氣球）所達到的最高度，約在十英里左右，探風氣球所達到的最高度，竟在十二英里以上，飛機的所達的高度，不及遠甚，不過七八英里罷了。</p>
<p>同温層的厚度究有多少呢？這問題在現在還不能確實知道，不過據一般人的推想，至少從六英里到二十二英里以上的空間，温度决定可以沒有差别。</p>
<p>空氣中各種紛亂的現象，多由於温度的高低不均而發生，因爲同温層中各處的温度都相等，所以不像對流層中的空氣有冷熱漲縮等現象，因此一切，雲暴燥濕等現象，僅能在對流層中存在而已。</p>
<p>同温層所以存在的原因，雖到現在還沒有知道，但他關於氣象學上的影響，非常重大，所以近來各國的科學家，都相繼作同温層的探騐，預料在不久的將來，當有出人意料的發現罷。</p>

<p>— 楊邨人</p>
<p>大晚報［火炬］上登載着一篇署名［紹伯］先生的大作［調和］，對於我與魯迅先生極盡挑撥離間的能事，而且對我個人又是借端誣陷災罪，看來是在［義憤塡胸］的神態之下寫成功的，［含血噴人］至今還有點熱氣息，不禁吃驚不小！（自然只是我一個人在吃驚，這應聲明）。而且對於我的［赤區歸來記］斷章，取義地神經過敏地加以明攻，看來他的［義憤塡胸］的神態是値得［青年大衆］敬仰崇拜的了。然而，我以爲事實上却似乎要出乎他先生的意料之外。</p>
<p>第一，我要請問的，我那篇［赤區歸來記］在［社會日報］是連續刋登的稿子，在編輯先生將它編在最後，這與我的什麽關係？同時魯迅先生的文章因爲是大衆語特輯的稿子，編緝先生將它編在最先，這與魯迅先生和我又有什麽關係？［壓軸子］是京戲班中的拿手好戲，我那篇［赤匪歸來記］不是小說，不敢當此殊譽，而我也不敢領受做那［壓軸子］戲的人物，這倒先要敬謝不敏。并且告訴［紹伯］先生，這回［駡人的藝術］應用得不見高明。</p>
<p>第二，我的［赤匪歸來記］是以客觀的態度將赤匪的情形報告出來，尤其是在那一段叙述坪坊的災後的荒凉市街的情形的那時的感想，完全是寫實主義的地說出，這怎麽不可以？難道是應該歪曲現實地欺騙讀者嗎？［紹伯］先生攻擊我那樣的叙述，而且認爲現在的赤匪是［向大衆中去］的地方，應該描寫成爲世外桃源似地，這就不明白他先生的思想觀念是什麽樣子的了。難道［向大衆中去］只有現在赤匪的地方是不是？這是一；其次，［青年們追隨着思想界的領袖們之後做了許多民慘淡的努力，有的爲着這還犧牲了寳貴的生命］，難道是認爲現在赤匪是世外桃源這才努力與犧牲的嗎？我先聲明，我那時去赤匪的思想觀念，却并不是那樣的。同時我也相信許多青年們也并不是那樣的。［紹伯］先生固然［義憤塡胸］可是沒有誰來同情你。而且，相信立刻就有青年們要來駡你，駡你在作反宣傳。跟着你起來駡我的，我也相信不會沒有，可是我相信你的煽動力到底是薄弱得很。</p>
<p>爲了揭起小資產階級革命文學之旗，與主張革命羅曼締克的理論，受了無理的謾駡和造謠中傷，已經［司空見慣］的了，不料現在竟因爲雜志編輯先生的編輯方法代人受過，這就未免令人苦笑。在這裏順便希望一下，小資產階級智識份子的先生們，可以不可以，以理論給我一個無偏袒的公正的批判麽？如果有誰來無偏袒的公正的理論給我加以批判，我是接受的。可是其所以希望小資產階級智識份子說話的原因，那是因爲魯迅先生招呼過我不要提起［無產階級大衆］而希望有對我加以批評的理論的原因，那是只看到左翼理論家谷非先生在文章上帶一筆無理地謾駡一下，并聽說魯迅先生更噓我幾口，與夫鑒賞到漫畫上無聊的素描，以及聽到造謠中傷，借端誣陷的惡言而已。</p>
<p>本來知道青年諸君一定出來［仗義發言］，尤其是魯迅先生一定要出發反攻用不着我來辯解，可是，又知道在人們的［仗義發言］與出發反攻之中，一定對我是附帶地乘勢地加以無理的譏消，於是乎自己說話了。（九月一日）</p>

<p>三個年頭不嘗痛快的洗澡過的人這一天的下午，却得整個兒的，在海水上飄浮着；旣感到非常的快意，漸漸的又覺疲倦萬分。爬上岸來，穿好了衣服，已經是夕陽西下的時候。頭有些痛，脚亦微酸，踏着近黃昏的影色，一逕到臨近的友人的家裏去。凑巧就給主人請作了客，在很不痛快的飲酒中，懶懶的心情，不經意的被清幽凉爽的輕風飄了去。蓆就是擺在天井裏，在暮色蒼茫的籠罩底下，一陣陣新鮮爽人的意味，沁進我的心脾，不禁，令人暗自喊着：</p>

<p>National Army Enters Shouning and Xiapu, Bandits Already Defeated</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Chairman Chiang telegraphed all commanders in Fujian, ordering the complete elimination of the remaining Red bandits before November. Failure to do so by the deadline will result in severe punishment. All major bridges on highways, whether in the rear or at the front, must be fortified with bridgehead bunkers within a specified period. These bunkers, near stationed troops, will be guarded by troops from nearby garrisons. Where there are no stationed troops, the bunkers will be garrisoned by security teams or volunteer corps from the respective counties. Chiang Ting-wen also telegraphed the province, requesting that all counties build pillboxes in key towns and cities. (Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Xiao Jing, the Bandit Suppression Commander of Southern Fujian, is scheduled to be sworn into office in Quanzhou on the 5th. The Fujian Provincial Government has dispatched Li Zuyu to preside over the oath-taking ceremony. Li traveled to Xiamen on the 1st, then to Quanzhou, to inspect the civil administration of Southern Fujian. After completing his duties, he will proceed to Zhangzhou and is expected to return to the province by mid-month. Xiao Jing is scheduled to convene a bandit suppression conference on the 6th, gathering all county magistrates to discuss issues such as the construction of bunkers, protection of transportation, census taking, organization of Baojia system, blockade plans, and rural cleansing. (Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Chairman Chiang has ordered all units to completely eliminate the remaining bandits by November 12th. Those who fail to do so by the deadline will be severely punished. (Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The 9th Division captured Hu Ying, a female mobilization worker of the Communist bandits, in Liancheng. It was also discovered that the Communist bandits had established women's training classes, disguised as refugees, to enter our military areas to seek husbands, agitate soldiers, and gather military intelligence. The headquarters has issued an order prohibiting all officers and soldiers from marrying in bandit-controlled areas and forbidding soldiers from engaging in conversations with women. (Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Wei Lihuang telegraphed the province, reporting that the Fang bandits in Qingyuan knew that the Fujian army was heavily guarded, making it difficult to succeed, so they did not dare to flee westward and remained in Qingyuan. The Wu Chengren unit of our 49th Division has changed its direction of advance and, on the 1st, received orders to enter [missing information] and other places, establishing a tight deployment. Simultaneously, it will coordinate with forces going to [missing information] and liaise with the Zhejiang Security Team to jointly suppress the bandits. (Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The remnants of Luo Fang's forces, under pressure from our army, are attempting to flee to Qingyuan in Zhejiang Province. Our troops stationed in Pucheng and the [missing information] Division have been mobilized. The [missing information] Division has especially stationed itself in Shouning to supervise the suppression. The remaining bandits in Pingnan and Zhenghe have been encircled by the Liu Heding Division, which has deployed elite troops to cooperate with the Li Mo'an unit from Gutian. The Zhejiang Security Department has also dispatched troops to intercept them. The bandits are now surrounded and will soon be annihilated. (Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The bandits of Shi Men, Xiapu, after being heavily attacked by our army, have fled in disarray towards Chanyang, with more than 20 bandits killed. The pursuing troops reached Yueguangping on the 1st, searching for the remaining bandits. (Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Chen Qixuan of the New 10th Division telegraphed that the Gu Regiment personally led two battalions to attack Xibing. The bandits resisted stubbornly, and after fierce fighting for four hours, the bandits were unable to hold out and fled to Baizhu. Regiment Commander Gu pursued them victoriously, entering Baizhu. According to captured bandits, (1) when the Fang bandits fled to Ningde, the Ren Tiefeng bandits indeed colluded with them to harass Fuan; (2) the Fang bandits had 500 sick and wounded soldiers, requesting the Ren bandits to take care of them, and after they recovered, they would work in Eastern Fujian; (3) the Fang bandits gave the Ren bandits 1,000 yuan and 20 rifles and 2,000 rounds of ammunition, ordering the Ren bandits to flee back to their old nest on the Jiangxi border. (Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The remnants of Luo Binghui and Fang Zhimin fled to Qingyuan County.

<h3 id="e66">Decline of the British Pound <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Still Noticed by Various Newspapers</p>
<p>(Paris) The decline of the British pound is still being noticed by various newspapers. Some say that the true purpose of the recent declaration by Dr. Schacht, the president of the German Reichsbank, is to promote the fall in the price of Anglo-Saxon currencies, in order to divide the opinions of the major powers on currency policy. According to French newspapers, the only way to defeat this strategy is for the United Kingdom and the United States to negotiate an agreement to consolidate the prices of the pound and the dollar, or at least a temporary agreement. Economic and Financial News, an influential newspaper in France, advocates that the Bank of France should refuse to accept gold in foreign accounts, so that foreign holders of gold will have to exchange it all in London, in order to reverse the downward trend of the pound in recent months and make it impossible to manipulate the spot and future prices of the pound. In addition, Minister of Finance Gaspar met with French Foreign Minister Barthou in Paris yesterday. It is reported that Gaspar pleaded with France to relax the quota for the import of British goods into France, on the grounds that the group of countries using the pound is now undecided, so the group of countries using gold should help each other, and other issues were also discussed. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) The closing price of the foreign exchange market today was $4.98875 per pound and $6.695 per 100 francs, roughly in line with the Paris exchange rate on Saturday morning, when the Paris exchange rate was 74.05 francs per dollar and 14.935 francs per shilling. Americans do not seem to have any impression of the fall in the price of the pound. The [Commercial News] predicts that if the dollar remains at or around the standard gold price, then the pound may still be sold in large quantities. However, it is difficult to determine whether the US Treasury Department will allow the export of large amounts of cash to maintain the price of the dollar. If so, the dollar will fall in price along with the pound. Some people believe that the dollar reserve is now quite sufficient and will not fall sharply, but most merchants hope that the dollar will continue to fall in price, so they are delaying the purchase of dollars to pay for goods.

<h3 id="e71">Respectfully on the Soviet Union Joining the League of Nations <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations has gradually become concrete. The two major powers of Britain and France not only support this matter from the sidelines, but also strive to clear the way for small anti-Soviet countries, so that the Soviet Union's application for membership can be easily accepted at this month's League of Nations General Assembly. We all know that the League of Nations today is far less powerful than before. First, Japan withdrew on the pretext, causing the dignity of the League Covenant to be fundamentally shaken. Second, Germany followed suit and withdrew, making it impossible to open the Disarmament Conference. Thus, this organization, which is tasked with maintaining international peace, relies solely on the strength of the three major powers of Britain, France, and Italy to barely survive. However, these three major powers each have their own agendas, and cannot coordinate their steps. The conflict factors between Italy and France are inherent and difficult to resolve. Since Germany withdrew from the League, Italy has even more strongly advocated the reorganization of the League, implicitly helping Germany to resist the Treaty of Versailles, that is, demonstrating against France, and working to restore the pre-war alliance diplomacy. At this time, the weakening of the League's power can be said to have reached its limit. Only Britain, France, and the small countries remain as mere embellishments.</p>
<p>Today's Europe is not like the beginning of this century when the German-Italian-Austro-Hungarian Triple Alliance manipulated Central Europe. In the past, the Franco-Russian Entente corresponded to each other in the East and West. In order to maintain its maritime hegemony, Britain had to suppress Germany to help France. The so-called armed peace of France was able to barely exist in the midst of contradictions and opposition. Now that conference diplomacy has gradually disintegrated, the contradictions between Italy and Germany are numerous, and the relationship between Britain and France, although friendly, also shows signs of breaking. The Soviet Union has formed another system, while the United States is standing by. The disputes in Europe are becoming more and more chaotic and uncontrollable. At the same time, France is carefully suppressing the resurgence of Germany. Balfour has even advocated expanding Britain's air defense. All of these are ironclad evidence of preparations for war. However, France has engaged in no less than three foreign wars in the past hundred years. In terms of losses, the item of able-bodied men alone has reached more than 5.5 million, which can be said to be a huge and painful wound. Moreover, the post-war financial difficulties have only recently been eased. Learning from the past, France has a special sense of caution. Its care in the next war may be even greater than that of the [nouveau riche] countries. The United States is mature and prudent. Its national policy is like its national character, so it only seeks economic stability, which is enough. Although there is talk of war preparations, it is not willing to lag behind others. However, the possibility of actual participation in the war seems to be even slimmer than that of France. Therefore, although the policies of Britain and France are not entirely compatible, the general trend is to maintain peace and stability. Their means are nothing more than the use of conference diplomacy to suppress the breakdown of the arms race. Under this situation, the Soviet Union is indeed sufficient to influence the European political situation and raise its own prestige. Once the Soviet Union joins the League of Nations, the League's declining prestige will surely be revived. This is what Britain and France sincerely welcome.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the proletariat, the League of Nations is originally a group of capitalist countries, and cannot coexist with the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union wants to create a world revolution by the hand of the Third International within the great encirclement of capitalist countries. The resistance is also particularly great, so it has to take a defensive stance and make friends with other countries. Moreover, the completion of its second [Five-Year Plan] still depends on the establishment of peace, so it very much hopes that the situation in Western Europe will be stable and that the threat from the Far East will be slightly reduced, which can be conducive to the future of domestic construction. Moreover, even if we take a step back and assume that the war between Japan and Russia is inevitable, we can also pour all our strength into the Far East to confront the Japanese. If the Soviet Union has a day to join the League of Nations, its intention must be nothing more than this. In that case, will Japan be vigilant about the development of this situation and restrain its arrogance towards Russia? Examining the facts, it is not entirely so. There are indeed reasons that can be obtained. One is that it is already difficult to harmonize the interests between Britain and the Soviet Union in Europe, while the conflicts in Asia are becoming increasingly acute. Britain's support for the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations is not so much about loving the League of Nations as it is about preserving itself. It would be a big mistake to take this as evidence of a close relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union. Japan understands the inside story, so it tries its best to exclude Russia and lure Britain. Second, the United States is still independent of the League of Nations, and it is extremely difficult for Britain and the United States to unite. It can be seen from the difference in the two countries' naval disarmament proposals. Japan can make full use of these weaknesses and exert its ability to strategize. If the actions of Britain and the United States are inconsistent, Japan can still have no need to worry about the future of the Pacific. Even if the Soviet Union joins the League of Nations, it cannot lose its courage in a hurry.</p>
<p>However, since the League of Nations has the participation of new forces, it should be more powerful than before in maintaining the status quo in Europe. Although Germany is very stubborn, it will also have some scruples. As a result, European countries may have the possibility of returning to conference diplomacy. This is in the cards that it will make some contribution to the future of peace in Europe. However, because Europe can temporarily maintain a state of relative well-being, various countries will inevitably pay more attention to the Far East. Will the war between Japan and Russia become more tense as a result? This is what our people should deeply study.</p>

<p>Final Mediation Completely Fails; One Million Workers Take Direct Action; Most of More Than Three Thousand Factories Shut Down</p>
<p>(Washington) The most significant strike in American history began at 11:30 tonight. 850,000 textile workers across the country have gone on strike demanding shorter hours and higher wages. The National Labor Relations Board made a final effort to mediate, but it was completely ineffective. Only the week is Labor Day, and factories are closed as usual. Therefore, tonight's strike is only a nominal start. The truly dangerous period will be Tuesday. Some factories will remain open, and workers who oppose the strike will continue to work. However, most of the 3,370 factories across the country will be ordered to close by the factory owners. According to Gorman, the vice president of the American Textile Workers Union, the strike will be fully supported. President Roosevelt is also paying close attention, but has no plans to intervene. Sloan, the president of the Yarn Industry Association, is now in New York, saying that the treatment of workers in the yarn industry has increased by 70% compared to 1929. Since the total number of workers has increased by 140,000, working hours have also been reduced to 40 hours per week. The National Labor Relations Board is now working hard to maintain peace in other industries and stipulates that wherever a majority of workers have formed a union, those workers can represent the entire body and negotiate with the owners. After the publication of this regulation, it should reduce the strike movement, because employers often have disputes over the issue of recognizing the union. The American Federation of Labor believes that this regulation is a great victory for labor. (1st National News Dispatch)</p>

<p>(New York) The general textile strike notice was issued at 11:00 tonight. At least one million people are directly or indirectly affected by the workers. 200,000 workers in silk factories and rayon factories also received notice today to join the strike. Although the director of the National Labor Mediation Board claimed yesterday afternoon that the labor unrest could still be salvaged, all hopes of mediation were completely extinguished last night. After a meeting of the board of directors of the American Textile Workers Union, strike committee chairman Gorman stated at night that the situation had not changed and the strike decision was implemented. It is now expected that 15,000 woolen workers in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New England, 500,000 workers in 1,200 yarn factories across the country, 200,000 workers in the silk and rayon industries, and 250,000 workers in the cotton clothing industry will join the strike. Union leaders are confident that they can force textile employers to accept their demands. The demands of the American Textile Workers Union are as follows: ㈠ Work five days a week, six hours a day, with uniform wages everywhere; ㈡ Existing weekly wages shall not be reduced; ㈢ End discrimination against union workers; ㈣ Reduce piecework; ㈤ Recognize the union as an agency for worker negotiation; ㈥ Establish an arbitration board; ㈦ Increase the participation of the National Recovery Administration in local labor bureaus. The employers, on the other hand, claim that reduced working hours will increase production costs, which is difficult to bear. A worker's strike is tantamount to encouraging the use of force and riots as tools for creating legal amendments and industry regulations for the recovery. From the employers' point of view, this is unacceptable. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) The general strike in the weaving industry will be implemented tonight at 11 o'clock. 900,000 people will join the strike in the north, south, and along the Atlantic coast, including 500,000 in the cotton weaving industry and 200,000 each in the wool and silk industries. Although Washington-related parties still express some optimism, hoping that a compromise can still be reached at the last moment, the general feeling is that the strike is inevitable, because Garrison, the director of the National Labor Relations Adjustment Bureau, has tried his best to mediate, but the employer's attitude is still unyielding. Strike leaders hope that all 900,000 people will be able to join the strike, but according to the employer's estimate, only 15% will participate, and the factories will still open as usual tomorrow. It is said that among the 900,000 workers, there are still a large number of unemployed workers, so it is impossible to predict how many will participate in the strike. Gorman, the leader of the strike committee, recently sent a telegram to the president of the American Veterans of the European War Association and the president of the Foreign Veterans of the War Association, saying that there are quite a few veterans who are related to the strike's goals, and that this strike movement is not the same as the Communist Party's attempt to create incidents. Please provide spiritual assistance to the strike. It is estimated that after the strike is realized, the situation will be quite peaceful. The only thing to fear is that the factories may hire people who specialize in destroying strikes to resist the strikers, which may cause retaliatory behavior by the strikers.

<h3 id="e75">China Contacts the United States Regarding Silver Policy <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Political and financial experts here today stated that the Chinese government is now exploring the silver policy of the United States in order to cope with it. The Chinese government is eager to cooperate internationally in stabilizing silver prices. The steps taken by China to explore American policy are roughly as follows: First, the State Department has received a Chinese request for an explanation of President Roosevelt's monetary policy. Second, Li Ming, the chairman of the Bank of China, is meeting with leaders in the New York banking and financial circles and plans to come here to meet with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi. Third, President's monetary policy advisor Professor Rogers will soon return to the United States after inspecting the silver situation in China. Fourth, the Chinese Embassy here is paying close attention to the US government's monetary actions. Today, unconfirmed news is circulating in diplomatic circles that President Roosevelt plans to discuss the silver issue with China, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, and Italy, but the government says it knows nothing about it. Financial circles believe that the President will take a conservative policy on silver for the time being. As for the above-mentioned request from the Chinese government to the State Department, officialdom is unwilling to disclose it, but it is understood that in addition to requesting an explanation of the President's silver policy, it also stated that the London Silver Agreement was concluded to stabilize silver prices. Now, the US government is implementing the Silver Act passed by Congress, which is preventing silver prices from being stabilized. (1st National News Dispatch)</p>

In order to reorganize Bulgarian finances, the League of Nations has sent a senior member to reside permanently in the Bulgarian capital. The senior member has requested to resign. After the resignation, a question arises as to whether the League of Nations should continue to send a senior member to reside permanently in the Bulgarian capital. The Bulgarian government advocates abolishing the position, but the League of Nations Financial Committee seems to advocate continuing to send a member in order to maintain contact between Bulgaria and the League of Nations. In addition, the Financial Committee will discuss what preparations to make in order to reach an agreement with bondholders to exchange interest on the 1923 Austrian loan, in order to reduce the interest rate. As for the Committee of Countries Guaranteeing the Austrian Loan, it will meet next Thursday.

<p>Requesting a Change to the Gross Tonnage Principle, Prepared to Exert All Efforts in Negotiations with Britain and America</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The London Preliminary Conference is scheduled to commence negotiations in early November after Rear Admiral Yamamoto, the Japanese naval representative, arrives in England with the Japanese government's instructions. Since the announcement of the Japanese government's disarmament policy, various opinions have arisen in Europe and America, making the realization of the formal naval disarmament conference next year a matter of considerable concern. Japan's policy is based on the principle of excluding the current ratio system and adopting a gross tonnage system, while demanding substantial reductions in both quality and quantity. However, Britain and America's disarmament attitude, in terms of quality, is limited to 32,000 tons with 14-inch guns, and the United States is very insistent on adhering to the current ratio system. Therefore, the future of the formal conference is quite pessimistic. (2nd, Japan Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's fundamental policy for next year's disarmament conference and the instructions for the disarmament preparatory talks will be formally decided in the cabinet meeting this week and taken to London by Rear Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. It is reported that the government's new disarmament strategy for the disarmament conference has the following two notable characteristics: ㈠ It is based on the government's absolute advocacy of naval disarmament, with ensuring substantial disarmament and international peace as the primary goal. ㈡ The content of this proposal is very flexible, making it possible for any country to accept it. Therefore, if Britain and America do not frankly accept this proposal, the government is determined to put forward a tough proposal, even if it leads to the breakdown of next year's conference. At the preparatory conference to be reopened in early October, this absolute principle will be presented, and all efforts will be exerted through individual and multilateral diplomatic negotiations to secure the understanding and approval of Britain and America. If the preparatory conference fails to achieve satisfactory results on this point and ends in failure, Japan will only conclude that next year's conference cannot be held in reality.

<p>Reaction to Japan's Expansion of Military Spending</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Nye stated today that the United States intends to increase its army and navy spending this year to more than double that of Japan. In addition, the United States still needs 100 million yuan for shipbuilding. Nye is the chairman of the Senate Munitions Investigating Committee. This statement was made in response to learning that Japan's military budget for next year is increasing. He believes that Congress, disregarding the fact that the United States' military spending already exceeds Japan's by more than double, will allocate another 100 million yuan for building warships to cope with Japan's naval competition. Nye also sarcastically said that Japan can certainly increase its spending further, and if so, it would undoubtedly be a blessing for arms dealers. (1st, Kuo Min News Agency)</p>

<p>Female Secretary of the China Eastern Railway Headquarters Arrested, Fingers Clamped with Metal Rods, Water Poured into Mouth and Nose</p>
<p>(Moscow) The following TASS communiqué has been published here: [On August 31st, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Ota, visited the Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Stomonyakov. Mr. Stomonyakov immediately stated that, according to information received by the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ms. Golovina, a female secretary of the General Affairs Department of the China Eastern Railway, was arrested by the Japanese military police on August 22nd and imprisoned in the military police headquarters. After a while, Ms. Golovina was taken to another room for interrogation, during which she was subjected to extremely cruel and inhumane torture. Several metal rods were clamped between her fingers, and at the same time, her fingers were tightly pulled with ropes, causing Ms. Golovina to faint. During the interrogation, Ms. Golovina's head and face were repeatedly punched, her hair was torn apart, and water was poured into her mouth and nasal cavity. This kind of brutal torture was carried out by Japanese personnel.</p>
<p>On August 27th, Ms. Golovina's condition became critical, so she was led to the street and sent home in the first hired car that passed by, without any assistance. At the same time, she was warned that if her health recovered slightly, she would be arrested again. Currently, the Soviet Consulate General in Harbin has assisted in sending her to the hospital due to her critical condition.</p>
<p>Mr. Stomonyakov further stated that this accurate information was reported to the Soviet Consulate General in Harbin by Ms. Golovina herself, and it can also prove that the ominous news published in the newspapers about the arrested railway workers of the China Eastern Railway being subjected to torture is not false. The newspapers all reported that the arrested railway workers of the China Eastern Railway were subjected to torture in order to make them admit that they had directed attacks on the eastern section of the China Eastern Railway. However, whether in the past or present, these railway workers themselves and their families have always been the first to suffer in such attacks.</p>
<p>Mr. Stomonyakov, based on the instructions of the Soviet government, protested to Mr. Ota regarding this action by the Japanese authorities in Manchuria, and stated that the Soviet government sincerely hopes that the Japanese government will take decisive steps to stop the aforementioned unacceptable actions, as they are clearly detrimental to the relations between the two countries.

<p>(Moscow) The Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Mr. Ota, and the Second Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs of Soviet Russia, Mr. Stomonyakov, held talks on the Far East issue. The Japanese Ambassador stated that he was expressing his personal opinions and had not received instructions from the government. This talk should be regarded as an exchange of views and not a formal talk. However, the opinions expressed by Mr. Ota can be regarded as consistent with the views of the Japanese authorities. Mr. Ota said that the situation in the Far East is very tense. Mr. Stomonyakov replied that Japan should be responsible for the tense situation. Mr. Ota also said that the Soviet Central Government is determined to maintain peace, which Japan does not doubt, but the Soviet local authorities in the Far East are constantly provoking the Japanese. The two diplomats also considered how to adopt practical methods to ease the atmosphere. The Japanese Ambassador said that in order to ease the atmosphere, not only should the issue of selling the China Eastern Railway be resolved as soon as possible when possible, but also more courageous methods should be adopted. In other words, in some areas of the Far East where both Japan and Russia have troops stationed, conflicts are most likely to arise due to border incidents. The troops of both countries in these locations should be withdrawn. After listening to the Japanese Ambassador's personal opinions, Mr. Stomonyakov replied that he would convey them to his superiors. (2nd, Havas)</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden At a meeting held recently in the capital of Denmark, the World Christian Church passed a resolution protesting against the German government's religious policy. At the time, the German representative believed that this resolution was an interference in Germany's internal affairs and refused to vote. The Swedish newspapers, regardless of their political color, took this opportunity to vehemently attack the religious policy of the National Socialist Party in unison. Swedish church representatives and journalists who returned home from the meeting in Denmark all said that the National Socialist Party's religious policy is related to the overall interests of the Christian Church. Therefore, protests from foreign countries should not be regarded as interference in Germany's internal affairs. The Swedish Daily News of the Conservative Party stated that Germany's religious policy is to transform the religion commonly believed by all mankind into a belief of one nation and one race, and even to exercise police power to stifle public opinion and adopt a secret service system to exclude dissidents. This policy is a serious blow to the entire Christian Church. This kind of means not only violates Christian doctrine but also goes against the human civilization that has arisen from Christianity.

<h3 id="e91">The Current Situation in Turbulent Europe (Italian Dispatch) <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Deteriorating Situation in Central Europe: Economic Decline in Italy</p>
<p>Italy is also a dissatisfied party to the Treaty of Versailles and is theoretically very close to Germany. However, there are still many differences between them. For example, Italy has never had ethnic problems domestically. The Fascists have never excluded Jews or other ethnic groups. The treatment is generally equal. Germany is not like that. In order to exclude Jews, the whole country is in turmoil, and even the world has a small shock. Germany itself is also greatly affected economically. Secondly, in terms of religion, Italy is of course the base camp of Catholicism, and Mussolini and his subordinates have not had conflicts with the Church. Germany, on the other hand, has a strong tendency to exclude the old religion with the new religion. Although this is not a fundamental opposition between Italy and Germany, it is indeed enough to affect their cooperation, at least calling her a little further away, adding a weight to the opposition of hegemony.</p>
<p>In mid-June, two dictators with a world-swallowing spirit, Mussolini and Hitler, had several earnest talks without the participation of a third person. So far, its content has not been fully disclosed, but this meeting is closely related to the Austrian independence issue, which no one denies. In Austria itself, Germany's current strategy is to merge with Germany, but after the merger of Germany and Austria, Italy and Germany will immediately enter a state of close combat, with no room for buffer. At the same time, Tyrol feels more threatened, and the whole of Italy is in anxiety. Just as the late Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss firmly opposed the merger of Germany and Austria, Italy took the opportunity to advocate Austria's independence in order to establish hegemony in Central Europe.</p>
<p>In terms of geographical relations, historical habits, and the current economic situation of Austria, its independence cannot be maintained in the long run. It should be fully merged with Germany, and Italy needs to extend its economic power to Austria over the high mountains, violating the natural geographical separation. Germany is just the opposite, and it is easy to do so. It can also be extended to Hungary, which hinders Italy's establishment of hegemony in Central Europe. At the same time, it aroused the dissatisfaction of the Little Entente. France naturally raised the Treaty of Versailles as a weapon of confrontation. As a result, Italy became more powerful, and the power to contain Germany became greater. Little did they know that the Germans and the German people of Austria! The National Socialist Party! First, they launched an attack and killed the Austrian dictator Dollfuss.</p>
<p>The bullet of Sarajevo once stirred up the European War. Dollfuss was killed, and the Austrian Home Guard relied heavily on Italian support and tried its best to suppress the National Socialist Party. If Hitler had been more enthusiastic at that time and given more assistance to the Austrian National Socialist Party, then the situation in Austria would have been very chaotic, and it would have been difficult to guarantee that the riots would not affect Italy. It was expected that Italian troops would come to the border and interfere across the border. Then who can guarantee that there will be no World War II. Who knows that Hitler kept a calm attitude and never reached out to Austria, which did not cause a major change, and overcame a dangerous situation. It was also the economic breakdown of Europe, especially Germany, that made her dare not arbitrarily break into trouble and seek her own defeat.</p>
<p>Germany is indeed in extreme economic difficulty, but what about Italy? Now, the financial situation of Italy and the general economic situation are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>The deterioration of Italy's finances did not start today, but this year is particularly bad. As of the end of May, the budget for this year was short of 68.03 million lira. When the budget was prepared before July last year, the assumed "deficit" was only 280 million lira. Little did they know that the difference was so huge. From July last year to May this year, the domestic public debt increased by 50.09 million lira in eleven months, and the total amount of debt increased from 972.15 million lira to 1,022.24 million lira. Even if the Italian government spends all its efforts to save government expenditures and increase taxes, its effectiveness is still very small. In the fiscal year 1934 to 1935, the fiscal budget is still short of more than 176 million lira. From the deterioration of the finances, we can get a glimpse of the decline of the national economy. Although she tried hard to use reciprocal trade agreements, control foreign exchange and credit, and implement a quota system, foreign trade imports increased by 4.6%, while exports decreased by 15%. The number of import surpluses increased from 62.9 million lira last year to 114.8 million lira this year. Italy's international balance of payments, in addition to trade, relies on the consumption of foreign tourists. Although this has increased considerably, it does not make up for the actual situation and only slightly provides funding. Moreover, the central bank's cash reserves have decreased by 600 million lira from the end of last year to June this year, which is a clear sign of capital flight. In such an economic situation, is it not a disguised suicide to fight a war? But we know that the European countries always use external development as a tool to suppress domestic panic. What's more, Italy is expanding upwards, and of course, it will expand its hegemony to cover up its ugliness. In the end, it can only firmly grasp Central Europe, extend to North Africa, and even use military force to do whatever it takes. This is the crisis in Europe and also the current cancer in the world. (August 8th, 2nd in Rome)</p>

<p>Kaifeng Dispatch, a few days ago, the dikes of the Second Dam of the Twentieth Fortress in North Pan, Kaifeng, overflowed, and the torrents rushed, posing a very dangerous situation. Chen Ruzhen, director of the River Affairs Bureau, and Zheng Kanghou, county magistrate of Kaifeng, and others, went to inspect the site on the morning of the 29th to supervise the rapid repair. Chen Zheng and others returned to Bian from Pan at around 5:00 PM today. According to the talks, from the fourth dam of the Nineteenth Fortress to the lower boundary of the Twentieth Fortress, the top of the dam is being scoured by large torrents, and many dikes have collapsed. New and old stone materials have been exhausted, and hemp bags are being used for emergency protection. However, the large torrents are still scouring and excavating, making it difficult to maintain for a long time. Moreover, heavy rain in Shaanxi and Gansu will cause large floods to arrive soon. It is difficult to guarantee safety without emergency preparations. It has been requested that the Mining Committee transport a large number of stone materials before September 5th. At the same time, the Lower North Branch Bureau is ordered to quickly transport black steel wire cages for workers to purchase old, bricks nearby, load them into cages, and throw them to protect them to provide emergency relief. More than 200 willow trees have been hung in the lower section of the 20th Fortress, but the soil work to reinforce the levee is extremely important. As soon as the special subsidy from the provincial government is allocated and the engineering fees from various counties in Kaifeng are paid, bids will be invited to rush to complete the work. Zhu Tang, the chief engineer of the Yellow Disaster Relief Association, also talked about the breach in Changyuan, and met with Lin Chengxiu, Hu Yuanhui, and Sun Qingze to agree on four measures: 1) encircle the willow dams to make them silt up; 2) build soil cabinets behind the willow dams to cut off the flow; 3) block the connecting ditches; 4) rush to build bank protection projects. As for the issue of responsibility, after the completion of the flood control project by the Engineering Relief Group last year, the central government sent personnel to inspect and accept it, considering it to be strong. The remaining flood control projects were all transferred to the Hebei Provincial River Affairs Bureau for acceptance and responsible management. The responsibility for the breach has been clearly established. (August 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Wuhu Rice Merchants Request Relaxation of the Prohibition <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch, the Anhui Provincial Government, due to the severe drought in the province and to prevent panic among the people, has issued several clear orders prohibiting the export of rice. After the new rice is on the market, it will be allowed to circulate within the province. In order to prevent smuggling, it is stipulated that the special commissioner's offices in each district and the county governments are responsible for regulation, and the local public security bureaus are responsible for investigation. In southern Anhui, in prosperous years, the rice and grain gathered in Wuhu are transported out, reaching as many as 8 million shi per year. Those transported by sail from Hexian Yuxikou to other provinces also amount to millions of shi. Therefore, the authorities attach great importance to the above two places. Since the issuance of the prohibition order, rice merchants in the two places have continued to smuggle rice out, which has a great impact on the people's food supply. Therefore, the inspection is even stricter. Recently, more than 30,000 bags of smuggled rice have been seized in Yuxikou, and thousands of shi have also been seized in Wuhu. The Provincial Food Regulation Committee received a report and specially sent Commissioner Li Zhenya to Wuhu to handle the matter. After Li arrived in Wuhu, he repeatedly consulted with Commissioner Wang Hezai, Public Security Bureau Chief Yu Qiguang, and rice industry leaders of the Chamber of Commerce. After Chairman Li Dachu of the grain purchasing and transportation industry requested and after sending a telegram to the provincial government for instructions, it was approved to flexibly resell them within the province. The issue of seizing smuggled rice has come to an end. However, the rice merchants believe that Anhui Province's rice production, even in times of extreme drought, can still supply the people's food with a surplus. Even in the year of the great flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the disaster area cannot be said to be not vast, but Hefei Sanhe and other places still have millions of shi of surplus rice. Low grain prices hurt farmers, which is not without impact. Moreover, there are many provinces in the country where the supply of rice and grain is insufficient. If this surplus is not allowed to be exported, then the majority of rural areas in Anhui will never have hope of revival. Therefore, the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce and various rice industries have planned to send representatives to the province after Commissioner Li to present the advantages and disadvantages to the provincial authorities and request permission to relax the prohibition. It is rumored that the provincial government also does not insist on using the surplus rice to absorb a large amount of cash to regulate the rural areas and save various industries, but only after a detailed survey and statistics of the rice and grain in the province, if it does not affect the people's food supply in the province, can a decision be made on the policy.

<h3 id="e94">It is Said that the Japanese-British Alliance and the Japanese-French Agreement are Unlikely to be Realized According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Japan Still Adheres to a Policy of Exclusive Control Over China</p>
<p>According to the Osaka Mainichi Newspaper on August 26th, following the reports from a Dutch journalist in Tokyo regarding a possible Japanese-British political agreement, there have recently been reports from French official circles in Shanghai about a possible Japanese-French political agreement. The Japanese Foreign Ministry believes that the possibility of these reports becoming reality is still weak. However, the rumors of a Japanese-British alliance and a Japanese-French agreement are related to all countries with interests in China, and they see the 1935 Customs Special Conference as a turning point, so the Foreign Ministry is quite concerned. Furthermore, the Foreign Ministry considers these rumors important in light of the recent British industrial mission's survey of Manchuria and the French consortium's investment in Manchuria. However, the fundamental policy of the Foreign Ministry regarding diplomacy towards China, which must be centered on Japan, concerning individual or multilateral political and economic agreements with third countries, has been decided as follows: 1. Japan's policy towards China, since withdrawing from the League of Nations, marks a new era. All political issues related to China will be resolved through direct negotiations between China and Japan, based on Japan's own views. This was communicated to various countries at the London Disarmament Preparatory Conference in late July. 2. The military and political issues recorded in the Anglo-Japanese Alliance treaty are relics of the past. Now, to ensure the autonomy of national defense, Japan is unwilling to be a watchdog for third countries in China. 3. If countries with interests in China can change their policy of hindering Japan's policy towards China, Japan is willing to support the principle of open door and equal opportunity in commerce in a passive and gentlemanly manner.</p>
<h3 id="e95">The Japanese are Actively Building the Najin Port in Northern Korea <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>In Peacetime, It Can Serve as a Base for Engulfing the Economy of Manchuria and Mongolia</p>
<p>In Wartime, the Port Can Undertake Important Military Missions</p>
<p>An Dong Dispatch: Since the completion of the three major ports in northern Korea, namely Chongjin and Unggi, the Japanese have controlled the authority of the economy of Manchuria and Mongolia, and achieved their goal of engulfing our Northeast. Recently, with the completion of the Kilhoe Railway, the importance of Najin Port has surpassed the other two ports. In the event of a major war in the Far East in the future, if Najin Port is completed step by step according to the Japanese plan, it will bear the same important military and transportation missions as Dalian. Moreover, the transportation network composed of the South Manchuria Railway from Dalian to Changchun, the Kilhoe Railway from Changchun to Najin, and other branch lines will provide a great boost to the port's handling capacity. Therefore, the Japanese are actively building it in stages, so as to complete it as soon as possible. The so-called policy of "three ports and five railways" for invading Manchuria and Mongolia has now been realized. Now, we explore the importance of Najin Port and its general outline, and record it clearly as follows:</p>
<p>Population Overview: Since the opening of the port, in less than a year and a half (nine months after the first phase of the port construction plan), the population has increased to more than 14,000, of which Koreans number more than 9,100, Japanese more than 2,800, and overseas Chinese 87, totaling 13,907.</p>
<p>Economic Construction: Since the opening of new shipping routes directly to Japan and Taiwan in April 1933, transportation has become extremely convenient. The shipping schedules of the ships are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Ship Name Port Name Shipping Company Frequency</p>
<p>Seikai Maru Niigata Port Hatoba Steamship Company Three times a month</p>
<p>Hokusei Maru Fushiki Port Hokuriku Steamship Company Once a month</p>
<p>Manshu Maru Tsuruga Port Kitanippon Steamship Company Three times a month</p>
<p>Wuchang Maru Osaka Osaka Shosen Kaisha Once a week</p>
<p>Guizhou Maru Osaka Osaka Shosen Kaisha Once a week</p>
<p>Two others Osaka Osaka Shosen Kaisha Once a week</p>
<p>In addition, the Korean Postal Steamship, Mitsui &amp; Co., Manchuria Transportation and other companies also have ships sailing. The throughput is not yet considerable, only 5,000 tons per day, of which 80% are building materials and financial goods, and the rest are food and groceries. Most of the timber is supplied from Korea and Japan, and metals and other goods are mostly obtained from Osaka and Kobe. Rice is mostly imported from Wonsan and Busan, and vegetables are mostly imported from Xinjing. In the future, when Najin Port is completed, it can handle 9 million tons of cargo, and its development is truly immeasurable.</p>
<p>Future Commerce: Since the opening of Najin Port, large-scale construction has been carried out. It is estimated that in 1933, the consumption of timber, red pine, cedar, and larch was about 1.38 million cubic feet, logs were about 56,000 cubic feet, and American pine was about 15,000 cubic feet, with a total value of about 260,000 gold yuan. The activeness of the construction can be seen. Most of those who come to reside in Najin due to its prosperity are from the labor sector and Shandong. There are food stores and grocery stores of all kinds. Among the general population, there are 91 people engaged in the restaurant business, 605 carpenters, 585 transportation workers, 95 fishermen, and 443 farmers. Other businesses such as civil engineering contractors, silk stores, cafes, bookstores, and doctors are all available. In the future, after the completion of Najin Port, the prosperity of commerce will surely make it a large commercial port.</p>
<p>Japanese Institutions: The Japanese institutions established in Najin include the Najin Town Office, police station, Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Veterans Association branch, fire brigade, Medical Association, Timber Merchants Association, Civil Engineering and Construction Industry Cooperative Association, and other associations. The only financial institutions are the post office, the Unggi Mujin Company branch, and the Colonial Bank branch, of which the post office has become the main financial institution. This is one of the characteristics of Najin.</p>
<p>Dense Transportation Network: The Kilhoe Railway terminates at Najin Port, but the section below is not yet completed, only to Unggi. It is about 37 miles from Unggi to Najin, and is scheduled to be completed in July 1935. At that time, the first phase of the construction plan will also be completed. Currently, there are buses running from Najin to Unggi, making 15 round trips per day, and it takes 40 minutes to arrive. There are also buses from Najin to Outer Chongjin, making 5 round trips per day, taking 4 hours and 40 minutes. In addition, there are regular ships between Najin, Chongjin, and Unggi, with three ships scheduled every day. Judging from the current situation, transportation is already very convenient. In the future, when the Kilhoe Railway is completed, transportation will be even more convenient.</p>
<p>Port Construction Plan: The total cost of the Najin port construction budget is 64 million yuan. The first phase of the plan started in 1933 and is scheduled to be completed in 1937, with a construction cost of 25.5 million yuan. The northwest part of Najin Port will be specially filled in artificially, and three docks will be built, as well as a vehicle yard, warehouses, roads, and open storage areas, which can accommodate four 8,000-ton ships and eight 7,000-ton ships. The throughput capacity can reach 3 million tons. To the west of the city, a special freight car yard and engine house will be built. In terms of railways, it is imperative to complete the Unggi and Najin sections. After the completion of the first phase of the plan, agricultural products from the Jilin-Heilongjiang border area and special products from northern Manchuria can be exported through Najin. The second phase of the industrial cost is about 20 million yuan, and three wharves will be built with an annual cargo throughput of 3 million tons, which can accommodate eight 8,000-ton ships, sixteen 7,000-ton ships, and eight 4,000-ton ships. The third phase of the project costs about 20 million yuan, and it is planned to accommodate twelve 8,000-ton ships, twenty-four 7,000-ton ships, and twelve 4,000-ton ships within four years. The cargo throughput can be increased to 9 million tons, which can surpass Dalian. That is the period when Najin Port will be completely successful.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Zhou Column Captured Xingguo Laoyingpan <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>And Captured More Than 30 Pseudo-Instructors and Others</p>
<p>The Zhou Army Has Arrived Thirty Miles from Xingcheng</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The 囗 Column Zhou Hunyuan, leading the Xie Wanxiao and other divisions, is stationed in the middle of the Gan River, contacting the Western Route on the one hand to encircle and suppress the remnants of the Xiao bandits on the west bank of the Gan River, and attacking Xingguo from Taihe on the other hand. After clearing out the scattered bandits east of Shacai and west of Taihe, the column continued to attack Xingguo County. On August 13th, they arrived at Laoyingpan (west of Xingguo). The bandits had built strong fortifications on the front, and the high mountains and steep peaks were extremely dangerous. The pseudo-61st and 62nd Regiments, the pseudo-6th Division, and local scattered bandits resisted stubbornly. The column used aircraft and artillery to bombard the bandit fortifications, and the fortifications and trenches were completely destroyed. Then the infantry charged in, and within only two hours, Laoyingpan was completely recovered. The remnants of the bandits fled in disarray towards Chongxianwei and Gaoxingwei. Gaoxingwei is located twenty to thirty miles west of Xingguo County. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, the 19th Route Army annihilated more than 10,000 bandits here. The bandits retreated to Ruijin and Doushi to recuperate for half a year before deciding to turn from southern Jiangxi to eastern Jiangxi in the Second Pseudo-National Congress and join the bandits led by Fang Zhimin on the borders of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui. This led to the fourth and fifth encirclements and suppressions by the National Army. Now the Third and Sixth Route Armies are approaching Shicheng, Ningdu, and Xingguo. The Zhou Column is following up on the bandits towards Gaoxingwei, only thirty to forty miles from Xingguo City.</p>
<p>Zhou Hunyuan telegraphed on the 25th to report the battle situation. The telegram said: "Our column captured the important pass of Laoyingpan belonging to Xingguo on the first day of the month. The general situation is as follows: (A) The bandits on the front had solid fortifications and resisted desperately. Fortunately, our officers and soldiers fought bravely with the assistance of aircraft and artillery bombardment. After two hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were defeated and fled. Our army firmly occupied Laoyingpan and the surrounding heights. (B) The bandits resisting were the pseudo-61st and 62nd Regiments and the entire pseudo-6th Division. After being defeated, most of them fled in a disarray to Gaoxingwei, and a part fled to Chongxianwei. (C) In this battle, we captured more than 30 pseudo-regiment instructors and others, killed about 200 bandits, wounded twice as many, and captured many spoils." (September 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Huangshan Park in Anhui is Scheduled to Open <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Wuhu-Tunxi Highway Has Been Completed</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Huangshan Mountain in Huizhou, Anhui Province, is a famous scenic spot in southern Anhui. In the past, due to the steep mountain roads, there were few visitors. Later, the local authorities of this province gathered important domestic figures and contemporary celebrities to form the Huangshan Construction Committee, and opened up the best areas of Huangshan Mountain as Huangshan Park. After half a year and spending huge sums of money, the park has now been arranged and is scheduled to open on September 15th, inviting important domestic figures and representatives from various places to participate in the celebration. Before the opening, they will gather in Wuhu. The Provincial Highway Bureau has sent personnel to Wuhu to jointly set up a reception center with the Wuhu Public Works Bureau. Moreover, as Wuhu is a commercial port on the Yangtze River and the first town in Anhui, it has been expanding roads and building Zeshan Park in recent years, which is also nearing completion. At the same time, the city area will be guided for those arriving in Wuhu. The Wuhu-Tunxi Highway from Wuhu to Huangshan has been mostly completed and is connected to the Jingwu Highway. If you transfer from Wuhu to Xuancheng (to Xuancheng, the train is more convenient), the Director of the Construction Department, Liu Yiyan, recently specially hired Shao Yizhou, the President of Wuhan University of Technology, to go to Huangshan to prepare everything in advance. The mountain is divided into two parts, inside and outside the mountain. Outside the mountain, the roads are crisscrossing and lead in all directions. Inside the mountain, there are five scenic areas such as "Yingu" and "Tianhai", which are very convenient for sightseeing. (August 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Jiangsu Construction Department Formulates a Drought Relief Construction Plan <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Allocates 4 Million Yuan in Water Conservancy Public Bonds</p>
<p>To Dredge Rivers in Various Counties South of the Yangtze River</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The drought this year in the counties south of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province is extremely severe. The Jiangsu Construction Department has specially formulated a drought relief construction plan, allocating 4 million yuan in water conservancy public bonds to dredge the rivers in various counties south of the Yangtze River as a remedial measure. The plan is extracted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Dredging the Junhe River from Zhenjiang to Wujin and Regulating Lian Lake in Danyang. The Jiangnan Canal from Zhenjiang Jingkou, through Danyang to Wujin, is about 80 kilometers long. It is both an important transportation route and a hub for receiving and discharging river water. To its north are the Danzukou, Yuehe, Baogang, Menghe, Desheng Port, and Zaogang ports, which are closely connected with the tides of the Yangtze River. It is truly the main vein of the waterways in Jiangnan. Danyang originally had Lian Lake, which was a natural reservoir. It receives water from afar and is also the source of water for the canal section. In dry years, it can also store water to help nearby farmland. Recently, the gates have collapsed and their function has been lost. The regulation of water sources has lost an assistant. In addition, the gates at various ports connected to the Yangtze River have been abandoned, making it difficult to control them. The canal itself is also blocked by silt, which has led to the phenomenon of intermittent flow in winter and spring for a long time. Its treatment is really urgent. The Canal Discussion Association once had a plan to raise the water level by setting up gates. Although the project is more economical, this is a work-relief project, so it is necessary to focus on earthwork. Therefore, manual dredging is still the principle. The construction methods are as follows: (A) Junhe River (1) The scope of construction is to dredge the entire canal from Zhenjiang to Changzhou, which is 80 kilometers long, and to dredge the Danzu River and the Danyang Huanzhang River to smooth the flow of the river. It should dredge the Danzu River for 0.925 kilometers and the Danyang Huanzhang River for 4.160 kilometers. The total length of the construction line is 85.085 kilometers. (2) Dredging method: manual dredging is used for all. The longitudinal slope of the whole river is regulated to be parallel to the lowest ice level line in previous years, which is about one to 77030. The depth is uniformly dredged to one meter below the lowest water level line. The average width of the riverbed is 12 meters, and the bank slope is one to 1.25. A total of about 7 million cubic meters of soil needs to be excavated. (3) Budget: Each cubic meter of soil is priced at one corner, totaling about 700,000 yuan. Filling and water drainage is about 60,000 yuan, and management and reserve costs are about 40,000 yuan, totaling about 800,000 yuan. (B) Lian Lake: Restore the original reservoir, build five-hole Tongyun floodgates, each hole is 6 meters, and one sluice gate, about 80,000 yuan. Repairing the Zhiyun and Lian Lake culverts is about 30, totaling about 30,000 yuan. Repairing the Lian Lake Huangjin fill is 40 meters long, about 30,000 yuan. The embankment is 16 kilometers long, about 180,000 cubic meters of earth needs to be piled up, each cubic meter is one corner, about 18,000 yuan. Dredging the Lian Lake Tongyun ditch is 6 kilometers long, about 230,000 cubic meters of earth needs to be excavated, each cubic meter is one corner, about 23,000 yuan. Management reserve is about 19,000 yuan, totaling about 200,000 yuan. The above two projects of dredging and restoring Lian Lake total 1 million yuan, and the total earthwork is about 7.41 million cubic meters. If the work is calculated for three months, about 2.47 million cubic meters per month, that is, 82,000 cubic meters must be done every day. Calculated at 2 cubic meters per person per day, it can accommodate about 41,000 disaster victims. The water conservancy relations involve not only the three counties of Zhen, Dan, and Wu, but also the counties of Jin, Li, Yi, and Xi, all of which have great benefits.</p>
<p>(2) Dredging the Chishan Lake River Basin</p>
<p>The largest water source between the capital and Zhenjiang is no more than the west of the Maoshan Mountains, which is the Qinhuai River basin, and Chishan Lake in Jurong is its natural reservoir. In the Southern Tang Dynasty, it was one hundred and twenty kilometers in circumference, but now it is only more than forty li. There are forty-two weirs around the lake, no less than hundreds of thousands of mu of fields. Over the years, it has become easy to discharge and difficult to store. The Qinhuai River channel is silted up. Once mountain floods break out, the vast ocean goes straight down, and ten miles of villages are swept away, and the people are drowned. For example, the impact in 1920 of the Republic of China caused the capital to suffer particularly severely. In 1918 of the Republic of China, the former Jiangnan Water Conservancy Bureau had already measured and planned, but the construction has not been carried out. This province has strictly ordered the prohibition of reclamation and ordered the three relevant counties to collect labor to dredge. But the project is huge. According to the original plan, the length of the project has reached 95.86 kilometers, and the earthwork that should be excavated has been more than 7.89 million cubic meters. Now I am afraid it is not limited to this number. The people of the three counties have limited power and cannot be competent, so it has been delayed until now. Now it is planned to adopt the original plan and design in two items: 1. Water storage plan, (A) Building lake dikes, that is, dredging the river channel in the lake, and using the soil from the dredging to build lake dikes, combining dredging and building, without spending huge sums of money. (B) Returning the reclaimed land to the lake. The eleven weir areas around the lake, totaling about 8,800 mu, should be investigated to determine those who have reclaimed privately, and no compensation will be given. In addition, another circle will be purchased. (A) and (B) are carried out simultaneously, which can restore Chishan Lake to a smaller range of reservoir. 2. Water discharge plan, (C) Dredging the main stream of the Qinhuai River, starting from Sancha Town in Chishan Lake, bypassing the northern foot of Chishan Mountain to enter the Jinning Hushou, to the Northwest Village to meet the Lishui River, and then flowing northwest around the western foot of Fangshan Mountain, passing through Shangfangmen to the capital and entering the river. The most silted places are the section from Sancha Town to the Northwest Village and the section from Saihong Bridge to Xinhekou. This is the dredging route of the main stream. (D) Dredging the tributaries. Since the lake and the Huai River have been separated, it is planned to dredge the relevant tributaries. It is still not possible to plan to dredge to communicate the meridians and take into account the benefits of the upper and lower reaches. It should be dredged upstream of the three rivers in the north, south, and middle above the lake, and all should be directed to the lake to prevent flooding the plains. Below the lake, the Jurong River and Lishui should be dredged to be smooth and passable to reduce the disasters in Jurong and Lishui and increase the power of the Qinhuai River to clean the water. The above-mentioned projects are calculated according to the original estimated earthwork, and are already more than 7.89 million cubic meters. The current situation should be increased. Now it is planned to select the most important ones to handle. For the time being, this number is still used for calculation. Each cubic meter is estimated at one corner, about 880,000 yuan, plus about 700,000 yuan for purchasing land, building dikes, building dams, pumping water, and managing fees, totaling about 1.5 million yuan. This project is of great importance to the water conservancy of the three counties of Lishui, Jurong, and Jiangning. If it can be realized, it can accommodate 45,000 disaster workers and maintain it for three months.</p>
<p>(3) Dredging the Yili Canal and the Danjingli Caohe Canal</p>
<p>The west of the Maoshan Mountains is the Qinhuai River basin, as described in the previous section. The east of the Maoshan Mountains is the western upper reaches of the Taihu Lake basin, and its water flows east, except for storing water as Gehu Changdang, with the Yili Canal as the east-west trunk road. The Yili Canal starts from Dongtian in the west, passes through the Taihu Lake of Liyi people, and is about 80 kilometers long. The tributaries on both sides are divergent, and the farmland benefits from it. However, in recent years, it has also been in disrepair for a long time, and the knots have become shallow. The flood years cannot be discharged smoothly, resulting in clogging disasters. In drought years, it is impossible to draw back the water from Taihu Lake to provide relief. Therefore, this year's disaster is particularly severe and should be dredged section by section to benefit farmland, which will also be of great benefit to shipping. The Danjingli Caohe Canal is about 54 kilometers long and is one of the north-south trunk roads in the west of Taihu Lake, running through the three counties of Danjingli. Because the land is higher and the riverbed is shallow, it often flows dry every spring, and irrigation and shipping are both damaged. If it can be dredged, it can connect to the Yili Canal in the south and the Zhensu Canal in the north. On irrigation, it can achieve the effect of mutual adjustment, and on shipping, it can achieve the effect of Changtong. It is also an important plan to promote agricultural affairs, and it should not be delayed. The earth that needs to be excavated for dredging section by section of these two projects is about 4.5 million cubic meters. Each cubic meter is estimated at one corner, about 450,000 yuan, plus about 50,000 yuan for construction, filling, water drainage, management equipment, etc., totaling about 500,000 yuan, which can accommodate 25,000 disaster workers for three months.</p>
<p>(4) Subsidizing Liuhe, Liyang and Other Counties to Dredge Rivers and Open Ponds</p>
<p>This year's severe drought Jiangnan Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jintan, Yixing, Liyang, Lishui, Jurong, Gaochun, eight counties, and Jiangbei Liuhe, Jiangpu, Yizheng, Jiangdu four counties, suffered particularly severely. Therefore, the province will allocate additional funds to order the counties to use work-relief methods to dredge rivers and open ponds. It is planned to allocate a total of 1 million yuan, accommodating about 50,000 disaster workers for three months. (2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e99">The Monument to the Yuecheng Base in Songjiang <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Since the demolition and opening of the West City Gate in this county in the past, the Party Department suggested that the Prime Minister's Memorial Monument be built on the Yuecheng base for the people to admire. After consulting the county and transferring it to the province for approval, the funds were raised. While preparing to build, Wu Boyang, who claimed the property rights of Yuecheng, filed a lawsuit, and the case was shelved. Later, Zhang Zuo and Liu Fu of this county submitted a petition to the province, requesting that the Prime Minister's Memorial Monument be moved to the planned Zhongshan Park, and the Yuecheng base be reserved for public buildings. So far, there is no suitable building, and Zhongshan Park is still a barren suburb with no construction in sight. The case has been silent for a long time. Suddenly, someone erected a stone tablet engraved with the five golden characters of the Prime Minister's Memorial Monument on the open space of Yuecheng. Passers-by who passed by thought it was a memorial monument that fell from the sky, and they were all surprised. A few days ago, a large number of carpenters built a hexagonal pavilion for the monument. On the day of erecting the pillars, five people bowed and saluted. The Prime Minister's portrait was respectfully placed under the monument, and firecrackers were set off, which was quite a grand occasion for a while. It is heard that the Wu family is still requesting the province to move the monument, and the key lies in the decision of the county government.</p>

<p>Ren Yin, a 55-year-old woman from Changshu, was a female servant in the house of Jiang Xianglin at No. 160 Zhiheng Lane, Xiaojia Lane, Suzhou due to poverty. One day at around 8 pm, Ren Yin was using an electric iron to iron clothes, but the electric wire suddenly leaked electricity. Ren Yin's right arm accidentally touched the electric current, and she immediately fell to the ground and died. The Jiang family immediately notified the female servant's family to come to Suzhou to take care of the matter and reported it to the local prosecutor's office. Yesterday (2nd), officials were sent to inspect the body and ordered to prepare a coffin for burial. The female servant's family came to Suzhou yesterday to prepare to negotiate with the Jiang family.</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Finance Department Strictly Investigates the Land Tax Fraud Case <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Xiyun, the director of the Land Tax Collection Office of the County Government, was accused by Zhang and Gu to the Finance Department of the Provincial Government, accusing Zhu of privately collecting taxes, embezzling public funds, dereliction of duty, and seven other charges, requesting that officials be sent to investigate. Now the Provincial Government has sent officials to Suzhou to conduct a secret investigation. It is heard that the investigation has been completed and returned to the province for reporting. Zhu Xiyun has submitted a report to the county government requesting punishment after being accused. Wuxian County Government has not yet made any statement on this matter and will review and handle it after the Provincial Government investigates and clarifies the matter.</p>
<p>Also, according to a long-distance telephone message, Dong Binqian was specially sent by the Jiangsu Finance Department to Suzhou to investigate the Wuxian tax fraud case. Now there are some clues. Zhu Xiyun, the former tax collection director, has been suspended from his post. Qian Zhonghua, who managed the books, has been taken into custody by the county government.

<p>When Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened administrative personnel from various provinces at a meeting in Nanchang in March of this year, he repeatedly admonished that the urban land tax should be planned and levied immediately. The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that if the land price declaration is handled, the land price will be confirmed by the government, and the intangible society will increase a large amount of active funds, and the social economy will be developed, and the industry and commerce will be prosperous. When the method is prescribed, a resolution is made to implement it, and the county magistrates of Wuxi and Nantong are instructed to handle it carefully and complete it on schedule. After seeing the newspaper, Yang Hanxi, the chairman of the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce, Qian Jihou, the director of the County Asset Office, and Rong Zongjing, etc., the Wuxi compatriots in Shanghai, and Zhang Yioou Wang Kunlun and others, the compatriots in Beijing, all believed that the Jiangsu Province held a land price declaration, starting with Wuxi and Nantong counties, and Wuxi County city has not yet reached a completely autonomous period, and the land price declaration does not conform to the National Construction Outline. They immediately telegraphed Chairman Lin, President Wang, President Sun, Minister Kong, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, as well as the Chairman of Jiangsu Province, Chen Guofu, etc., to ask them to cherish the local difficulties and issue an order to stop the land price declaration in Wuxi. After receiving the telegram, Chairman Chen believed that the land price declaration did not violate the grand purpose of the national construction outline, and it could be expected to realize the Prime Minister's last instruction as soon as possible. Yesterday, Rong Zongjing and Yang Hanxi, etc., were specially instructed to understand this intention and assist in completing the declaration. Now it is learned that the land price declaration office should start household declarations from the 16th of last month in accordance with provincial regulations. Later, due to various reasons, the assistance committee decided to postpone it for one month and report it to the province for verification. A directive was received a few days ago that the household declaration should be handled in accordance with the prescribed time and should not be delayed. After the office was ordered, it has now started the declaration yesterday, starting with the city. It is heard that the scope of the declaration is limited to the jurisdiction of the first district of this county.</p>

<p>More than 2,000 farmers from Tianyang Township, Haidian Township, Shishan Township, etc., in the third district of Zhenhai, due to severe drought and crop failure, gathered at the county government yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to petition. The Xiepu Public Security Bureau was unable to stop them, and reported to the county government by telephone. After arriving at the county, the farmers demanded to be received by the county magistrate and presented three requests: (1) Exemption from land rent, (2) Postponement of last year's prepaid rent to offset next year's rent, (3) Exemption from grain tax. The county magistrate, Xu Yong, replied that the first two points needed to be discussed with the landlords, and the third point needed to be submitted to the province for approval. The farmers were dissatisfied with the county magistrate's reply and refused to leave the county government. Subsequently, members of the county party headquarters were sent to persuade them, but to no avail. As of 8:00 PM, the matter remained unresolved, and there was unrest in front of the county government. Later, the county magistrate telegraphed the Ningbo Garrison Command's First Regiment, which dispatched troops to suppress the situation. The farmers retreated to the City God Temple that night, and the petition event remains unresolved.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Zeng Zhongming Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the Recent Political Situation in Nanjing and Jiangxi</p>
<p>According to the Far Eastern News Agency, Zeng Zhongming, the Vice Minister of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Railways, visited Chiang Kai-shek in Jiangxi and returned to Nanjing the other day. He came to Shanghai on the night express train from Nanjing at 7:15 yesterday morning to discuss important matters of the Ministry of Railways. Yesterday, a reporter from the Far Eastern News Agency interviewed Mr. Zeng at his residence on Jiaerye Qing Road and had the following conversation:</p>
<p>Reported to Chiang Kai-shek on Visit to Jiangxi: Mr. Zeng first said that his visit to Jiangxi was to inspect the road administration of the Nanxun Railway and to take the opportunity to meet with Chairman Chiang and report to him. There were no special tasks. Minister Gu (Mengyu) left Pingnan yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday) and returned to Nanjing. After arriving in Nanjing, he immediately returned to his post in the ministry.</p>
<p>Huang Fu to Go to Nanjing and Transfer to Shanghai Today or Tomorrow: Chairman Huang (Fu) and I met once in Lushan. He has now completed his work in Lushan and will leave Lushan within the next two days (i.e., today or tomorrow) to go to Nanjing to meet with President Wang and prepare to return north. However, the exact date has yet to be determined. It is heard that he plans to transfer to Shanghai for a trip to take care of personal matters on his way back to Ping.</p>
<p>Wang to Go to Lushan Around the 10th: Mr. Zeng continued, "President Wang's motive for planning to visit Lushan again this time is purely to accept Chairman Chiang's invitation to address the Third Term Military Officer Training Corps. It has now been found that the Corps will open tomorrow (i.e., today), so there is no need to rush there. He will wait until after the envoy from Belgium arrives in Nanjing on the 8th to meet with him, and then leave around the 10th."</p>
<p>Chiang is in Good Health, Rumors are Baseless: Chairman Chiang is still in good health, and all kinds of rumors from the outside are fabricated by public debt speculators and are absolutely baseless. Chiang felt a slight stomachache before, but he recovered completely immediately. I met with him three times on the 26th, 27th, 28th, and 3rd, and again when I went down the mountain on the 30th, talking for more than an hour.</p>

Therefore, it issued another order yesterday to urge the report, saying, "The Ministry previously issued the Land Rent Table, the Rural Social and Economic Survey Table, the General Situation Survey Table of Agricultural Associations at All Levels, and the Rural Cooperation Survey Table, successively ordering the Hall and the Bureau to forward them for investigation and filling in the case. Now that it has been a long time, no report has been submitted to the Ministry, or although it has been reported, it is still incomplete, which is quite slow. In addition to issuing orders, it is hereby ordered that the Hall and the Bureau follow the previous orders and forward them for investigation and filling in, and submit them in a timely manner, without delay."</p>

<p>Drafting a Report on the Investigation of Sericulture in Shandong Province</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, He Shangping, Executive Committee Member of the Sericulture Improvement Association of the National Economic Council, went to Shandong last month to inspect sericulture and aims to improve sericulture in Shandong by next spring. He returned to Shanghai yesterday and drafted a very detailed report on the investigation of Shandong sericulture, and has established two improvement farms in the province. The full text of the report has been obtained by a reporter from the Huadong News Agency and is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Overview of Shandong Sericulture: Shandong sericulture is divided into mulberry sericulture and tussah sericulture. The mulberry sericulture area is most prosperous in Linqu, Mengyin, Xintai, Yidu, Boshan, Zhoucun, and other places along the Jiaoji Railway line. Tussah sericulture is centered on Yantai, Muping, and other places in eastern Shandong. Therefore, the route of this investigation is mainly along the Jiaoji Railway line, Zhoucun, Qingzhou, and various places in Yantai and Taocun.</p>
<p>Climate and Soil: The Shandong Peninsula is bounded by the Bohai Sea to the north and the Yellow Sea to the south. Except during the height of summer, the air is often foggy near Jiaozhou Bay and the air is relatively humid. Other places bordering the Bohai Bay to the north, from Weixian in the east to Zhangqiu in the west, have many mountains and smooth rivers. The climate is dry and mild during the spring and summer rainy seasons. The soil is fertile and free from waterlogging, making it more suitable for sericulture and mulberry planting than Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Since 1918, Chinese and foreign people and various sericulture agencies have repeatedly tried to raise European varieties and often achieved satisfactory results. Softening disease is rare, and the toxicity rate of microsporidia is also reduced. From this, it can be seen that Shandong sericulture can be said to be blessed by nature. At the time of the silk market's severe decline, if you want to save and reduce costs, Shandong is the only place to do it.</p>
<p>Mulberry Garden Situation: The variety of mulberry in Shandong is generally called Lu mulberry, among which there are yellow Lu mulberry, black Lu mulberry, etc. due to different skin colors. There is also a kind of Lu mulberry with a bud end leaf curl, shaped like a sheep's horn and chicken crown, which is widely planted in various places and is rich in yield, and it is valuable for preservation and reproduction. In recent years, various agencies have tried to plant Hu mulberry, but it has not been popularized. It is said that it is more prone to wilting disease than Lu mulberry and remains to be investigated. However, Hu mulberry is far less reliable than Lu mulberry in terms of cold resistance. Therefore, the future trend in Shandong is still to improve Lu mulberry as the main focus. There is no need to promote other varieties without considerable experimentation. As for the form of pruning, the original ones are mostly arbors, and there is no need to change them for a while. However, most of the cultivation methods are old-fashioned, and crops are often planted between mulberry trees, which is also the reason for the recent decline in the silk market and the farmers' economic hardship. Recently, it has been heard that in Lu Province, there are those who cut down mulberry trees and replant other crops, accounting for as much as one-third of the total, which is very frightening.</p>
<p>Silkworm Cocoon Situation: It has been found that the majority of silkworms in Lu Province are three-sleep silkworms. Although there are two types of three-sleep silkworms, yellow and white, yellow cocoons are still the majority. Their cocoon shape and cocoon color are very similar to Sichuan three-sleep cocoons. Their advantage is that the fiber is strong and the strength of the silk is strong, which is welcomed by the European market. Five years ago, the Golden Taishan brand raw silk produced by the Qingdao Suzuki Silk Factory was the best in the world, and it was this variety that was slightly improved and reeled in the cocoon factory. Later, the quality gradually declined, and the Silver Taishan brand came into being. Recently, the Golden and Silver Taishan brands have disappeared. This kind of high-quality fine silk is quite costly, and it is not worth the loss at today's silk prices. Recently, the four-sleep improved varieties used in Jiangnan have also been tried by the people, but the number is very small. In the future, Lu Province may also try to breed more European crossbreeds in order to improve quality rather than weight, in order to save the decline of the rural economy.</p>
<p>Silkworm Seed Manufacturing: Silkworm seeds are traditionally made by farmers themselves. Even the improved varieties produced by the Qingzhou Provincial Sericulture Experiment Farm are very small and do not help. Poor silkworm seeds and poor results cause farmers to lose more than they gain, which is also one of the important reasons for mulberry cutting. In other cases, such as in 1920 and 1921, silk merchants from Lu Province purchased four-sleep improved varieties from Jiangnan and distributed them around Zhoucun, and the results were good. The number of white cocoons of Xin Yuan Zhe Gui that are now scattered among the people is its inheritance. At the same time, the Japanese reeling silk in Qingdao also distributed improved varieties to Qingzhou, Zhoucun, and other places, but they were only a flash in the pan.</p>
<p>Old Method of Drying Cocoons: Silk factories still use the old method of drying cocoons, and farmers are often unwilling to sell them because the cocoon prices are too low, and they pickle the cocoons with salt. It is unknown how many silkworm cocoons have been ruined in this way. Therefore, if you want to improve Lu silk, and establish public cocoon drying, it is a matter of urgency. According to He Shangping yesterday, when he spoke to the Huadong News Agency reporter who visited him, he said that after personally inspecting the sericulture industry in Shandong Province, he deeply felt that Shandong Province is the most suitable area in China for planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms, because the soil and climate are more suitable than those in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Therefore, he has now set up two autumn cocoon guidance centers in Linqu and Yidu, and distributed 200 sheets of improved varieties. During the autumn silkworm season, he will first conduct a trial experiment, and next spring, he will persuade people in the province to raise improved varieties to achieve improvement. As for the spring silkworms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, Zhejiang has 600,000 sheets, each sheet has about 35 jin of fresh cocoons, Jiangsu has 25 jin, and Sichuan has about 22 jin. Although the harvest cannot be said to be abundant, it cannot be said to be poor. The autumn silkworms have been distributed, and the early ones have produced two-sleep, and the late autumn silkworms will also be distributed within the next few days. As for the overseas sales agency proposed by Chu Huiseng, the leader of the silk business community, the association is very supportive in principle, but the association is urgently needed to enrich the silk production step by step, so it is a pity that it cannot take care of it at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Zhejiang and Anhui Green Tea Sales are Slow <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Pingshui Tea Costs 60 Yuan Per Load, Not Enough to Cover Costs</p>
<p>Wuyuan Tea, More Than 20,000 Boxes, is Difficult to Ship to Shanghai Due to Shallow Water</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the production and sales of Pingshui green tea in Zhejiang, and Tunxi and Wuyuan green tea in Anhui this year are as follows:</p>
<p>Low Price of Pingshui Green Tea: Pingshui Town in Zhejiang is the central area of the green tea market in Shaoxing County. The types produced are divided into silkworm eye, ant eye, butterfly eye, mosquito eye, etc., collectively known as Pingshui tea. They are packed into boxes and sold abroad, with the United States accounting for the most sales, followed by Russia and France. In its heyday, the annual sales volume was more than 500,000 boxes. In the past ten years, the European and American markets have been encroached upon by Indian and Ceylon tea. According to the statistics of the foreign tea industry association, it has dropped to 180,000 boxes. This year, the export of Chinese tea is even worse than before. Pingshui green tea is no exception. Last year, the price of tea was about 70 yuan per load, but this year it has fallen by about 10 yuan, to only about 60 yuan. Tea merchants cannot even cover their principal, and are all very frustrated. In the blink of an eye, the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and the financial situation is extremely tight. It is not easy to improve sales and market prices.</p>
<p>New Tea in Wuyuan is Difficult to Transport Due to River Drying: In addition to specializing in foreign-style Zhenmei and Dabang for sale to Europe and the United States, the leftover tea scraps from Wuyuan County, Anhui Province, are transported to various tea shops in China for domestic consumption. This year, due to poor production, the tea shops have given priority to purchasing in order to transport them to Shanghai for sale. However, due to severe drought, the rivers have dried up, and the navigation of the Rao River and Huijiang River has been blocked. All the shops are hoarding tea in the production area, waiting for the water to start shipping. At the current market price, there is no big profit to be made, but prolonged delay will only consume interest. Therefore, the tea merchants are very anxious. According to the Tea Industry Association, there are about 20,000 boxes of tea that have been stranded in the production area. However, it is difficult to predict when these boxes of tea can be transported to Shanghai because there is no water to sail the boats.</p>

<p>Arriving at the Port at 3:00 PM on the Japanese Ship Kasado Maru</p>
<p>A Total of More Than 700 People, Mostly from Fujian and Guangdong</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, it is not uncommon for Chinese overseas Chinese in Japan to be unreasonably expelled and returned to China in recent years. Recently, more than 700 overseas Chinese workers have been forced to return to China. The Chinese workers embarked on the Japanese mail ship Kasado Maru from Yokohama on the 30th of last month and will arrive in Shanghai. The ship is scheduled to arrive at the port at about 3:00 PM today and will dock at the Huishan Pier in Yangshupu. Most of the overseas Chinese are from Fujian, Guangdong, and Qingtian counties in Zhejiang Province. The main reason for Japan's large-scale exclusion of Chinese workers is that domestic industry and commerce in Japan have been affected by the economic recession in recent years, resulting in a sharp increase in unemployment among domestic workers. Therefore, they do not hesitate to use this unreasonable method to exclude overseas Chinese as much as possible.</p>

<p>Pinghan Railway Scheduled to be Implemented on the 15th</p>
<p>To be Handled Concurrently with Private Sanbei and Others</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after the state-owned China Merchants Bureau contracted the national railway water and land combined transport, it carried out improvements to the combined transport on the Longhai Railway and other routes. As for the improved combined transport measures for the Jiaoji Railway, it was decided to implement them from September 1. Regardless of whether the goods are transported from various stations to various ports, or from various ports to various stations, the freight will be calculated in accordance with the combined transport price list, and one ticket will be directly available. All freight can be paid in advance or on delivery. Advance payment must be paid in full at the time of shipment, and payment on delivery must be paid at the place of arrival. All procedures for customs duties at Jiaohai Customs and the inspection bureau of the port authority can also be handled by the two bureaus on behalf of the merchants, and the merchants do not need to take care of them in Qingdao. As for all the measures for the water and land combined transport on the Pinghan Railway, they are all ready and it has been decided to implement them simultaneously with the private Sanbei Shipping Company and the Ning Shao Shipping Company. It has now been scheduled to be implemented on the 15th of this month. Liu Hongsheng, general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, will take the opportunity to go to Lushan to inspect the business of the branch in Hankou and will return to Shanghai soon.</p>

<p>Mr. Gu Yigu, a rich merchant from Haining who lives in Shanghai, has always been happy to donate to public welfare and charitable undertakings in his hometown. During the Haining famine in 1932, the Haining people living in Shanghai raised funds for relief, and Mr. Gu generously donated 3,000 yuan, which was praised by the villagers. This year, Haining has suffered another drought, and the disaster is the worst in decades. Rice-grabbing riots have occurred repeatedly in Xiashi, Yuanhua, and other places. Later, the provincial government sent troops to suppress the riots, and County Magistrate Jiang Hui and local gentry discussed follow-up measures, but there are no concrete measures yet, which is worrying. Mr. Gu, seeing the severity of the disaster in his hometown, was moved with compassion and purchased 500 shi of brown rice in Shanghai, which was shipped to Xia on the last month and entrusted to someone to start by investigating the poorest and poorest farmers. Once the procedures are completed, all the relief rice will be distributed. The disaster victims in the five districts of Ningyi are waiting to be fed. They will get a great deal from this benevolent relief rice. However, there is more than one wealthy merchant from Haining living in Shanghai (Mr. Gu's ancestral home is Haiyan, and he has lived in Xiashi Town, Haining for generations). There should be those who rise up in response and do not let Mr. Gu monopolize the beauty of the moment.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Xiang Kangyuan Returns from an Inspection Tour of Southeast Asia <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>He Speaks of the Miserable and Painful Impressions Gathered Along the Way</p>
<p>Young Overseas Chinese in Siam Do Not Recognize Their Motherland</p>
<p>The Domestic Market is Entirely Plundered by Japanese Goods</p>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, a prominent industrialist, departed two months ago for Southeast Asia to inspect industrial and commercial activities, as well as the economic situation of overseas Chinese. Over the course of two months, he visited Malaya, Siam, Burma, Annam, Singapore, Penang, and other places, gaining profound impressions. Mr. Xiang has now completed his inspection and returned, arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday, a reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency made a special visit to interview him, and he detailed the painful impressions he gained during his trip regarding the overseas Chinese in various regions, as well as the crisis facing Chinese goods in Southeast Asia. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Painful Impressions from Southeast Asia – According to Mr. Xiang, of all the places I</p>
<p>visited in Southeast Asia, Siam left the deepest impression. When I arrived in that port and before I even disembarked, I was subjected to unreasonable and harsh questioning and inspection by customs officials. This situation is especially difficult for Chinese people, and there is no legal recourse. This is because our country has not sent a consul to the area, and overseas Chinese are largely at the mercy of their whims, with the possibility of being arbitrarily expelled or imprisoned. I once met a customs official on a boat who, because his appearance did not resemble that of a Siamese, was questioned. He truthfully stated that his father was Chinese and his mother was Siamese. Because his father was unrighteous, he did not want to follow his father but followed his mother, and he obtained his current customs official position in Siam thanks to his mother's Siamese nationality. When asked about the situation in China, he said that China was a small and insignificant country, with no products to export, and relied on Siamese food (namely, what we Chinese call coarse rice) for survival. The Chinese population is increasing, but because their own country cannot accommodate them, they migrate to Siam every year. Hearing his words, I was speechless. For a descendant of overseas Chinese to utter such words, the shallowness and alienation of their impression of their ancestral country is evident, which is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Commerce is Declining Rapidly – Historically, commerce in Southeast Asia was pioneered and created by overseas Chinese from our country. After more than four hundred years of arduous operation, the domestic goods currently sold are still old-fashioned products from the 18th century. This is a world apart from the latest Western mechanical products. Furthermore, forty years ago, the commercial industry of overseas Chinese was gradually seized by British and Dutch Western goods. In recent times, the Japanese have used dumping policies to compete with British and Dutch goods, and within only twenty years, the Western goods business market has been completely seized by Japanese goods. Currently, Japanese goods account for a staggering 95% of Siam's imports. However, according to the Siamese Immigration Bureau, there are only 435 Japanese immigrants in Siam, 2,700 Europeans, 4 million Chinese, and 2 million of mixed Chinese-Siamese descent. The Japanese immigrants have operated in Siam for less than twenty years, with a population of less than 500, yet they have been able to control the country's economy. Our country has operated in Siam for 400 years, with a population of 6 million, but we are now surpassed by those who came later, which is truly shameful.</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Sell Well in Malaya, etc. – The situation in other places such as the Malayan Islands, Annam, Burma, and Singapore is largely the same as described above. The dumping of Japanese goods is unbelievable. For example, in Kuala Lumpur, Japanese undershirts sell for only 40 cents per dozen, light bulbs for only 2.5 cents each, and silk cheongsam fabric for only 70 cents per piece. No other country in the world could compete with them. However, according to the overseas Chinese compatriots in the area, as long as there are domestic Chinese goods available, they are willing to buy them even if the prices are twice as high. This shows the passion and deep love of overseas Chinese for their motherland. If the people of our country can pay attention to promotion, there may be a way to salvage the situation.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Various Regions Sell Domestic Products – Mr. Xiang continued, "Overseas Chinese in various regions have often told me that they are very willing to promote domestic products and are happy to purchase them. However, in the past, when they priced or inquired about prices in China, the replies they received often did not address their questions, or they received no response at all. Sometimes orders were not delivered on time, the goods often did not match the original samples, and the quantities were short. No reasons were given for these problems, or if there were reports, they would arrive only after a month or half a month. These various reasons have caused even the most enthusiastic overseas Chinese to gradually become discouraged. This situation is very regrettable and needs to be urgently remedied."</p>
<p>The Promotion of Domestic Goods Should Be Carried Out Quickly – Currently, the older overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia still have a deep understanding of their motherland. However, the younger generation is mostly fond of using foreign goods and has a vague and uncaring impression of their ancestral country. Therefore, if domestic goods are not promoted and developed at this time, in a few years, when the older generation passes away and the younger generation lacks a concept of their motherland, it will be even more difficult to promote domestic goods. If our country does not pay attention to the Southeast Asian market in the next five or ten years, I fear that trade in Southeast Asia will never be recovered by us. I hope that our government and people will pay attention to this and actively develop it.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Business Delegations Return to China for Inspection – Mr. Xiang finally said that the decline in the promotion of domestic products by overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and the suffering of overseas Chinese abroad is largely due to the lack of close contact between overseas Chinese and their home country, which has created a detached phenomenon. The difficulties and inconveniences faced in Annam, Siam, and Malaya make the overseas Chinese in these areas eager for the government to send consuls to take charge as soon as possible. Furthermore, the overseas Chinese in various places feel that they do not have a clear understanding of the recent situation in their motherland, including the progress of our country's politics, economy, and industry and commerce. Therefore, I have strongly encouraged them to return to China to conduct inspections in order to understand the situation and plan for joint development. Many overseas Chinese have expressed their willingness. Around the end of this year, overseas Chinese from Singapore, Siam, Malaya, and other places will come to Shanghai to inspect the actual situation in China and the progress of industry and commerce in order to jointly seek overseas development.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Liu Weichi, Vice Minister of Industry, arrived in Shanghai from Jiangxi the day before yesterday. Due to a small boil on his left chest, which was quite serious, he went to a hospital in western Shanghai for treatment yesterday morning. The date of his return to Nanjing will be determined after he recovers.</p>
<p>The "January 28th" Memorial Hall Changed to the National Humiliation Memorial Hall</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the "January 28th" War Memorial Hall in the Public Education Hall on Wenmiao Road in Shanghai has recently been renamed the National Humiliation Memorial Hall by the hall's management. According to the person in charge, the "January 28th" Incident is certainly worth commemorating, but the name is too narrow in scope. Memorial objects related to the "September 18th" Incident and other national humiliations cannot be displayed there. In order to solicit more national humiliation memorabilia to alert the people of the country, the hall has been renamed the National Humiliation Memorial Hall.</p>

<p>To Avoid Damaging the Cables and Disrupting Communications</p>
<p>Joint Proclamation by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau received instructions from the Ministry of Industry, approving a communication from the Ministry of Transportation, stating that the submarine cable from Wusong to Yantai has recently been frequently disrupted, mostly due to fishing boats anchoring and netting. Yesterday, it issued orders to the city's fishing organizations and, together with the Public Utilities Bureau, issued the following joint proclamation: The Social Affairs Bureau has received instructions from the Ministry of Industry, approving a communication from the Ministry of Transportation, stating that the submarine cables from Wusong to Yantai, Yantai to Dagu, and Qingdao to Sasebo are crucial for north-south communication and communication between China and Japan. In recent months, they have been frequently disrupted, which not only greatly affects telecommunications but also causes significant losses due to years of repairs. Repeated reports indicate that the cause of the damage is mostly due to fishing boats anchoring or netting. It is imperative to strictly prohibit fishing boats from anchoring or dropping fishing gear near the submarine cables to avoid damaging them and maintain telecommunications. The original attachments are included, ordering immediate compliance and proclamation to inform fishermen to avoid such actions. Upon receiving these instructions, the Social Affairs Bureau has already issued orders to the Shanghai Fishermen's Association and the Shanghai Fishing Vessel Industry Association to instruct fishing vessel companies to comply. Hereafter, when fishing vessels go to sea, they must not anchor or drop fishing gear near the submarine cables to avoid damaging them. This joint proclamation by the Social Affairs Bureau, etc., is for all fishing vessels to comply with. This proclamation is issued on September 1, the 23rd year of the Republic of China, by Wu Xingya, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau.</p>

<p>Leaders from All Circles Went to Support the Coffin, A Grand Occasion. Madam Zhang, the original wife of the late Shanghai gentleman Hu Jimei, passed away from illness the day before yesterday at the age of 63. Madam Zhang was skilled at managing the household and raising her children to prominence, setting an example for women. Her sons Yunlai, Yunqiu, Yun'an, and Yunzhuang are all well-known figures in politics and business, and they have extensive social connections. Mr. Hu was also enthusiastic about public welfare, creating the Chinese team of the International Merchant Corps, and he was particularly renowned in the financial community. Yesterday was the day of Madam Zhang's funeral, and no fewer than 700 leaders from all circles went to support the coffin. The coffin was placed in the Yongfen Cemetery, and the ceremony was very simple and solemn. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>More Than 700 People Supported the Coffin – Yesterday, those who came to pay tribute included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Song Ziwen, standing member of the National Economic Committee, Yang Hucheng, pacification director of Shaanxi Province, Yang Xiaotian, director of the Shanghai Security Office, Chen Guangfu and Qian Xinzhi from the banking industry, Bei Songsun, Lin Kanghou, Shi Liangcai and Zhang Zhuping from the press, Rong Zongjing and Wang Xiaolai from the business community, Mayor Zhou Xiangxian of Hangzhou, and well-known Shanghai figures Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and Huang Jinrong, and Zhang Shouyong and other 700 people. The public memorial organizations included the Shanghai Local Association, presided over by Shi Liangcai, the National Merchant Bureau Council, the Gauze Exchange, the Chinese team of the International Merchant Corps, and the China Cotton Industry Trading Company, etc. Plain cars and white horses were used, showing extreme mourning and glory.</p>
<p>Memorial Text of the Shanghai Local Association – On September 2, the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Shi Liangcai, Du Yong, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Yongming, Yu Hede, Xu Xinliu, Zhang Yin, Liu Hongsheng, Mu Xiangyue, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Jia'ao, Zhu Qinglan, Qin Runqing, Guo Shun, Hu Mengjia, Kuai Yanfang, Chen Guangfu, Feng Bingnan, Wang Boyuan, Huang Yanpei, Zha Liangzhao, Chen Zheqing, Wang Zhixin, Zou Bingwen, Nie Lusheng, Shi Bo'an, etc., of the Shanghai Local Association, respectfully offer incense, flowers, and clear wine to the spirit of Madam Zhang, Mother of Hu, and say: Oh, virtuous Madam, your virtue is like that of the ancients, frugal and in accordance with etiquette, peaceful and mindful of worries, with the difficulty of Zhong and Hao in the two wars, which should serve as a model for eternity. When you married into the Hu family in An Ding at the age of marriage, you were like a woman of Wang's and Liang's families, and no one heard any idle words in the village, so that your husband had no internal worries. You respected each other like guests, scattered and gathered wealth in the manner of Zhu Gong, and you were devoted to Mr. Jimei's vision. Tears of calling to the heavens, and no direction in the Emperor's land, you spent twenty years of your heart and blood, guiding the descendants in righteousness. People envy the brothers for their brilliance and competition, but they do not know the meticulous planning of Madam Zhang. Now, the sons are bright and upright, the grandsons are numerous, leaving a good reputation in Shanghai, and pointing to the Shen land of Lianyun. Song and dance in the family, there is no meal that is not shared together in the same house, so that they can live to a hundred years. Alas, it is difficult to keep a good day, the wind suddenly rises, and you lightly pluck the flower with a smile, looking up to the sky and controlling the crane, withdrawing your hand peacefully, and going to the Western Paradise. We have either a friendship from generations, or are listed as relatives, and our sorrow is deep. We believe that the protective spirit is always fresh, and the stringed instruments of Pan Guan are always new. We offer a bunch of jade-like hay, and a full bottle of wine three times. Heaven, please witness our virtue, and may the soul return to the truth. We respectfully present this offering.</p>
<p>Eulogy of the National Merchant Bureau – On September 2, the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Lu Xuepu, Chen Guangfu, Yu Hede, Hu Zutong, Qin Zuze, Rong Zongjing, Huang Jinrong, Jin Tingsun, Guo Shun, Ye Zhuotang, Shi Liangcai, Liu Hongsheng, Zhang Shouyong, Zhang Jia'ao, Du Yong, Yang Ying, Hu Bijiang, Li Ming, Qian Yongming, Yu Rizhang, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Yin, and Sheng Shengyi, Huang Jiangquan, etc., of the Supervisory Board of Directors of the National Merchant Bureau, respectfully offer clear wine and delicacies to the spirit of Madam Zhang, mother of Hu. The Holy and virtuous Madam, hailing from Qinghe, married into the An Ding family, with an eminent family background. Her kindness and dignity are unmatched, a role model for women of her time. Her descendants are blessed, harmonious and respectful. She received teachings from the family as a child, was able to read the books of her father, and was a renowned lady of virtue, praised throughout her village. After her marriage, she was praised for her beauty, inheriting the business of Tao Yi, and assisting her husband with merit. She was a champion in the maritime trade war, founded the merchant group, and it was popular in all countries. Maintaining it to this day, she spared no effort. How virtuous is the mistress of the house, a teacher to women. Her children are numerous, and she educates and nurtures them. From the elders above to the servants below, she values harmony and enjoys herself in peace. Within the family, there is joy and harmony, filling it with goodness and sharing the spring breeze together. Her bright and upright sons are well versed in poetry, the trees are jade, and the four are talented. They have created the Yi River and made a bow, relying on Ji Fang. All of us in the same boat, rely on her compassion. Why did Heaven not care and cause this star to fall. The jade palace bears witness to the fruit, and we look up to the cloud carriage. May the spirit come to this place, and we respectfully present this offering.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Guichi County Sends Another Telegram to Xinwei Relief Association for Disaster Relief <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>280,000 Disaster Victims are Starving</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Xinwei Relief Association of the Renji Charity Hall in Shanghai received another telegram from Guichi County, Anhui Province, requesting disaster relief to save lives. The original telegram is recorded below: "To the Xinwei Relief Association of the Shanghai Renji Hall, We humbly report that Guichi County is suffering from a severe drought, and the lives of the people are in danger. Previously, various local institutions and legal entities jointly telegraphed to request urgent relief to provide food for the people, which we believe has been acknowledged. Since the autumn equinox, it has still not rained, and the drought has become even more severe, causing widespread panic. Our association has been organized in accordance with the provincial government's order, called the Drought Relief, but the actual disaster has already occurred and cannot be remedied. In addition to opening granaries and selling grain at reduced prices to temporarily alleviate the current situation, there is not much grain in storage, and it will be difficult to sustain. Therefore, we have to find ways to provide relief to save the disaster victims and maintain order. It has been found that since the Dragon Boat Festival, there has been no rain in Guichi County, and the drought has been severe. Not only are the fields dry and the land cracked, and the seedlings withered and died, but also the ponds, wells, streams, and rivers have all dried up. Not only are the waterwheels exhausted, but the people also have no water to drink. Such an unusual drought has not been heard of in a hundred years. Since the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the county has been exhausting the supply of military service, followed by the ravages of bandits, and then the great flood of the twentieth year. Natural and man-made disasters have come one after another. Last year's autumn harvest was also affected by drought in high-lying areas and flooding in low-lying areas. The local vitality has long been injured, and the rural economy has been bankrupted. This year, there is an even greater drought. 280,000 lives are at stake, as if hanging upside down. Not only is there no surplus seed, but people are waiting for death. The situation is unbearable. The current situation is dire, and the future is unimaginable. We are local people and feel the pain deeply, but we have no way to provide relief. Therefore, we send a telegram to appeal, admiring your association's compassion and concern. We hope that you will generously grant relief and save the disaster victims, which will not only be appreciated by the local people but will also be an immeasurable merit. With urgent words, we are extremely fearful. The Guichi County Drought Relief Committee bows."</p>

<p>One Woman Among Them is a U.S. Citizen</p>
<p>Russia Requests Extradition; We Are Considering Carefully</p>
<p>A week ago, the Shanghai Municipal Government received an official document from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that, according to a notification from the Russian Minister to China, Bogomolov, nine Russian fugitives, who had committed murder in Vladivostok, Russia, had secretly come to Shanghai aboard a Russian cargo ship. He requested their arrest and extradition. The Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested all nine fugitives, including one woman, in the Nanshi area. It is reported that she is the wife of the leader of the nine, and she claims to be a U.S. citizen, but the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai has not yet received a notification. According to the Russian Embassy, the reason why the Soviet Russian authorities are eager to arrest these nine people is that they have committed seven major cases of murder and robbery in Vladivostok. The Russian Minister is currently discussing extradition with our foreign affairs authorities. As a matter of sovereignty, we will handle this matter carefully.</p>

<h3 id="e136">A Record of the Grandeur of the Mu-Chen Wedding <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Mu Jiaji, the second son of the industrialist Mu Ouchu, studied in Europe and America for six years. He first obtained a Bachelor's degree in Political Economy from Harvard University and then specialized in banking at the University of London for one year. Last year, during the World Economic Conference in London, Mr. Mu served as an assistant secretary of the Chinese delegation. After returning to China, he was recruited by Finance Minister Kong to the Central Bank, where he served as an assistant editor in the Economic Research Department. Yesterday was the auspicious day for the wedding of Mr. Mu and Miss Chen Canjin of Wumen, a top student of the Great China University, at the Dadong Restaurant. Many people from all walks of life went to offer their congratulations. The wedding ceremony was simple yet extremely solemn. The introducers were Mr. Xu Xuying and Mr. Chen Cuizi. The officiant was Mr. Shen Xinqing. The speeches from the guests were full of humor and seriousness. The remarks from the groom's father, Mr. Mu Ouchu, and the officiant, Mr. Shen Xinqing, were famous sayings that garnered applause from the audience. Here is the recorded speech of the groom's father, Mr. Mu Ouchu:</p>
<p>The ancients said, "Leaving a son a chest full of gold is not as good as teaching him one classic." I lost my education at a young age, and only after the age of thirty did I have the opportunity to go abroad. Although I gained some superficial knowledge of Western learning, I had no guidance in our country's classics and history. I am ashamed that I cannot follow the example of leaving classics to my children. When the cotton yarn industry was flourishing, I had some savings, but because of the urgent needs of society, they were quickly dispersed. In recent years, the yarn factories have been in extreme decline. Even taking flesh to mend sores is barely enough. Even if I wanted to follow the worldly custom of leaving gold to my descendants, I would be unable to do so. Han Shuguang retired in his old age, and the emperor bestowed upon him great rewards. When Guang returned to his hometown, he ordered his family to sell the gold utensils and invite relatives, old friends, and guests to enjoy themselves. Some advised Guang to use the gold to establish property for his descendants. Guang said, "Am I so old and senile that I do not think of my descendants? I have old fields and houses, and if my descendants work diligently, they will have enough to provide for food and clothing and be on par with ordinary people. To increase it further would only make my descendants lazy. If a virtuous person has too much wealth, it will damage their ambition. If a foolish person has too much wealth, it will increase their faults. Moreover, the wealthy are resented by the public. Since I have no way to educate my descendants, I do not want to increase their faults and create resentment." I deeply agree with these words and wish to practice them. Therefore, I will pass on neither classics nor gold, but I have done my best to allow you to study in Europe and America for six years and seek the essence of modern learning. However, your learning is only at the beginning. To reach the hall and enter the room, and to truly apply your knowledge to your family and society, you must work tirelessly and research and explore at all times and in all places. You must strive for it. Furthermore, our service to society must begin with family harmony. To have family harmony, one must start with self-restraint and cultivation. Miss Chen comes from a distinguished family in Wumen and has always followed family teachings. She will surely help you build a loving and harmonious family, allowing you to be physically and mentally relaxed, and to continue to devote yourself to learning, so that you can contribute to society and your family. This is what I deeply hope for.</p>

<p>Jiufu Branch is working hard to produce new medicines. The Jiufu Yagier capsules, also known as cod liver oil essence pills, contain the two essential vitamins A and D, which make a great contribution to national health and conditioning. They are praised by the medical community. The best thing about them is that they are extracted from cod liver oil and have no unpleasant fishy taste. Therefore, for those suffering from social and economic weakness, general debility, postpartum conditions, congenital deficiencies, as well as chronic bronchitis, tuberculosis, rickets, etc., who should take cod liver oil but are concerned about the fishy taste of cod liver oil, Jiufu Yagier is the only option, as it is simple and easy to take and has remarkable effects. Because one pill is equivalent to seven cubic centimeters (one teaspoon and three-quarters) of the best cod liver oil, its effectiveness is evident. Therefore, all knowledgeable people recognize Jiufu Yagier as a standard tonic. After the autumn winds rise, more and more people are taking it, so its sales are rising sharply, and there is a tendency for supply to fall short of demand.</p>

<p>Worth 500,000 Yuan, Network Spanning Various Countries</p>
<p>Precious ornaments such as gemstones and diamonds are the most beloved possessions of the leisure class. Governments of various countries use the excuse of luxury goods to impose multiple times the amount of taxes in order to restrict them. However, because these items are expensive, small, and easy to carry, those who smuggle them for profit have organized an [international smuggling ring]. In addition to the Japanese, who naturally make up the majority, merchants from various countries have also joined. The scale is large, the number of ears is many, and it is not easy to crack down. Recently, a large batch of diamonds and other gemstones worth 500,000 yuan were smuggled from this port and Dalian for sale, but were discovered by the Osaka Customs Surveillance Department Police Department. The entire department was mobilized to conduct a thorough investigation. The headquarters of this secret organization and its main culprits were finally found to be located at Yamada U's house in Sumiyoshi Ward, Osaka City. The mistress of the main culprit, Yamada, and one other person were arrested. The other main culprits are at large. The organization's smuggling network has secret agencies in Osaka, Dalian, Shanghai, and other ports, equipped with coded telegrams. Their methods of exchange and communication are extremely clever and difficult to detect. A reporter from the Shinji News Agency learned from Mr. Chen, an antique dealer in this city, that many Japanese people have become rich by engaging in this kind of business. The secret agencies in Shanghai, such as Hongkou and the French Concession, are all organized, but on the surface, they still operate under the guise of other businesses. It is difficult to detect them unless one has close contact with them and has a secret cooperative relationship.</p>
<h3 id="e142">The Municipal Zoo Purchases a Siamese Giant Elephant, Transported to Shanghai <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>A New Elephant Enclosure Under Construction, Giant Pythons from Guangdong Also on Display</p>
<p>The Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road in the South City, in order to enrich its content, ordered a giant elephant from Siam last year. It is now known that the elephant was transported to Shanghai at the end of last month for public viewing. A giant python has also been newly purchased from Guangdong, which is a rare animal in Shanghai. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Giant Elephant Status: The Municipal Zoo entrusted someone to purchase a giant elephant from India last year in order to provide it for public viewing. However, because the elephant is large and the price is high, the purchase was delayed. It was not until last month that a giant elephant was purchased from Siam, worth two thousand several hundred yuan. It was shipped to Shanghai on an American merchant ship in the middle of last month and transported to the zoo by a large truck for display. The elephant is about six feet tall, about seven feet long, the nose is about five feet long, the circumference of each foot is more than a foot, the tail is short, and the roar is thunderous. However, it is docile. In recent days, many citizens have gone to visit, and it is quite crowded.</p>
<p>Land Acquisition for Enclosure Construction: After the giant elephant was transported to Shanghai, because the zoo's site is small and there is no proper place to house it, it is temporarily tied to a wooden post with an iron chain in the western open space. Meanwhile, a plan to build an elephant enclosure has been drawn up. It is planned to purchase about seven or eight acres of private land in the southwest according to the private land acquisition method. The purchase has been approved by the mayor, with an investment of about eight thousand yuan. Iron railings will be built around the site, and wire mesh will be used in the middle. Construction should start soon. The project will cost about one thousand yuan and is expected to be completed in three months.</p>
<p>Guangdong Giant Python: The zoo has recently purchased a giant python (also known as a python) from Guangdong, which is more than ten feet long, has a circumference of about a foot, has colorful spots all over its body, and needs several pounds of beef per day to eat. It has been displayed in an iron cage in the southeast corner of the zoo. It is also heard that the zoo has submitted a request to the municipal government to allocate preparatory funds for expanding the zoo's operations and purchasing other animals, in order to expand and improve it.</p>

<p>Gongs Successfully Captured, Guns and Bullets Seized</p>
<p>At 3:30 p.m. yesterday, the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, based on a tip-off, learned that there were bandits hiding in a shack at the intersection of Gonghe Xin Road and Nanshan Road in Zhabei, hiding pistols and bullets. The team immediately dispatched squad leader Zhang Yingpin and detective Wu Songshan, riding in a public car of the Public Security Bureau, and rushed to the Public Security Bureau of the Fourth District of Zhabei. Together with squad leader Wang Shifu, Squad Leader Yang Shoubao, detectives Yin Ruifu, Chen Guiqing, Miao Jinhai, Zhao Huairen, Sun Youzhi, Zhu Bengui, and police chief Yang Jintang of the Taiyang Police Station, the detectives, fearing that the bandits would resist arrest, wore iron vests. When they arrived at the shack on Hongnanshan Road, the bandits were caught off guard, and four bandits were captured in one fell swoop. A six-inch new Brown Lin pistol (number 5355), thirteen bullets, and three magazines were found on one of the bandits, named Zhang Yuqi. They were all taken to the district. According to Zhang Yuqi, he was 28 years old, from Andong. Another bandit, Mo Changgao, was 27 years old, from Dongtai. The two of them lived at No. 41 Lehe Lane, at the end of Datong Road. Another bandit, Li Mingliang, was 24 years old, from Zhenjiang, with no fixed abode. Another bandit, Xing Yunmei, was 29 years old, living on Pushan Road. Later, Zhang Yuqi confessed that there was another pistol hidden under a piece of iron sheet in a small alley next to the shack. The detectives, except for sending the three bandits to the detective team of the Public Security Bureau, were led by Wang Geng and other detectives, along with the bandit Zhang, to the small alley next to the shack on Hongnanshan Road, where they found a new Brown Lin pistol under the iron sheet, numbered 22311, containing seven live bullets. After taking them to the district, District Chief Gong Xikui ordered them to be sent to the detective team of the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Therefore, the original team of detectives, along with the bandit Zhang Yuqi, were immediately sent to the detective team of the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Drug Dealers Sent to the Province for Handling <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Morphine Dealers Jiang Shaotian and Wang Eran, Opium Dealers Chen Luzhou and Liu Yongsheng</p>
<p>The First Branch of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau (Minhang Town), recently received a tip-off that Jiang Shaotian and others were selling strong drugs in the Wujia Hall area of Shijia Lane in this town. Director Xu Yamin dispatched patrol captain Xia Shoutian and other police officers to arrest Jiang Shaotian and Wang Eran, and seized morphine and morphine needles. After preliminary interrogation at the bureau, they confessed. They were sent to the headquarters and explained to the County Anti-Smoking Association. As they were selling and injecting morphine needles for others, they should be tried by military law. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau dispatched police officers yesterday to escort Jiang and Wang, along with the drug evidence, to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. Also, according to reports from the Public Security Bureau, the association seized soil dealer Chen Luzhou at the Zhuanqiao bus station, and soil dealer Liu Yongsheng at the Qianliang Temple bus station, who were privately selling opium, a total of 169 taels. The association did not dare to make a decision on its own because the case involved a large amount of privately sold opium, so it reported to the provincial capital and instructed them to send the case to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters for handling. Therefore, Chen and Liu were also sent to the headquarters yesterday, along with the opium, for interrogation.</p>

<p>Claimed to go to India to Sell Boxing and Earn 200 Gold Per Month</p>
<p>Two Children Suddenly Disappeared, Wang Arrested as a Suspect</p>
<p>The grandchildren of local old woman Zhu He, residing at No. 113 Peide Lane, Datong Road, Xinzha, Zhu Bingxian, 16 years old, granddaughter Zhu Zixian, 13 years old, and adopted grandson Xu Bingxian, are poor and struggle to make a living. They had to seek a livelihood and study under the boxer Master Xue. Every day, Xue leads them to the open space near the Zhongnan Hotel at the eastern end of Dongxin Bridge on Aidaoya Road to sell boxing for a living. They go out early and return late, which is their usual routine. Next to their selling place is Wang Wenbo from Tianjin, who also flies a steel fork for a living. Because they are in the same industry and in the same position, they know each other. On the 27th of last month, Wang suddenly said to Zhu Bingxian and the other two children, "Your livelihood in Shanghai is quite hard. Why don't you go with me to India to sell boxing? You can earn 200 yuan a month." The three children did not say yes or no at the time. However, at about 11 a.m. on the 28th, Zhu Bingxian and Xu Bingxian suddenly disappeared. Although Zhu He looked for them everywhere, she could not find them. Later, according to her granddaughter Zhu Zixian, Wang Wenbo wanted to take Bingxian and the others to India. Wang was suspiciously suspicious, so she paid attention to him. Until about 7 p.m. the day before yesterday, Zhu He met Wang on the road at the intersection of Hubei Road and Aidaoya Road. She reported it to Chinese patrolman No. 259, who arrested Wang Wenbo and took him to the Xinzha patrol room for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The patrol room lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and requested permission to detain Wang for investigation of the missing two children. Zhu He and her granddaughter Zhu Zixian testified to everything, but Wang Wenbo firmly denied luring the two children. Judge Wu reviewed the confession and ordered Wang to be detained for further investigation at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Tobacco Exchange Industry Replies to Wu County Counterparts Regarding Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>This city's Tobacco Exchange Industry Association received a letter from the Wu County (Suzhou) Cigarette Industry Association yesterday, stating, "Our association has investigated the license tax for this year. Since the change from ministerial management to self-management, we had hoped to reduce the burden and help the struggling merchants. However, the situation has worsened, and the quota has increased sharply. Taking our county as an example, the quota last year was 38,000 yuan, but this year it has increased sharply to 60,000 yuan, a difference of 22,000 yuan. If we can afford it, it is a matter of provincial tax, and we should try our best to pay it to enrich tax revenue. However, in this autumn of rural bankruptcy and commercial decline, maintaining the status quo is already difficult, let alone increasing the burden and heavy taxation. In order to understand the license tax situation in various places, our association has sent inquiries to neighboring counties to understand the trend and learn from it. We know that your association is the leader of the industry in Shanghai, and the masses admire it. It is expected that you have carefully planned and planned for the welfare of the industry regarding the increase in the quota for this tobacco and alcohol license. Please reply in detail to the methods your industry has taken and the increase in the quota, so that we can follow and achieve consistency. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby send a special letter for consultation. Please investigate and reply." The Tobacco Exchange Industry replied to the Wu County Cigarette Industry Association, "We have just received your letter, inquiring about how the industry in Shanghai is dealing with the change from ministerial management to provincial management for this year's license tax. It has been investigated that the tobacco and alcohol license tax in Shanghai has been transferred to the Municipal Finance Bureau for management. Our industries directly pay the autumn license tax to the Finance Bureau, and there is no quota. If there is an increase, we are requesting a reduction. We hereby reply."</p>

<p>No Concealment or Omission Allowed to Comply with the Law</p>
<p>The Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Associations of this city received a letter from the Shanghai Bao Stamp Bureau No. 64 yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, we have received Instruction No. 875 from the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, which states, 'We have approved the letter from the Shanghai Municipal Government No. 3500, which states, "We have approved the incoming letter stating that the stamp for tobacco and alcohol licenses should be the responsibility of the collecting agency to affix on behalf of the license holders. Please forward this order to be carried out." We have instructed the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau to reply that the Bao Stamp Bureau branch had previously requested instructions on how to proceed. The Bureau replied that the autumn tobacco and alcohol license tax in this city has already been collected. Regarding the stamps that should be affixed to the licenses, this Bureau has already added a stamp mark on the licenses (the stamps are purchased and affixed by the merchants themselves). If this Bureau is to affix the stamps on behalf of the license holders at this time, it would be difficult in practice. We will follow the instructions when we start collecting the tax this year." Having approved the previous reason, we are issuing this order to be complied with and forwarded to the tobacco and alcohol merchants in the district to ensure that they purchase and affix stamps to their autumn tobacco and alcohol licenses in accordance with the regulations in order to maintain the tax policy. We hope that you will forward this order to the tobacco and alcohol merchants to ensure that they purchase and affix stamps to their autumn tobacco and alcohol licenses in accordance with the regulations, without any concealment or omission, in order to comply with the law and maintain the national tax. We deeply hope that you will do so."</p>

<p>All Equipment Unprecedented in Shanghai Piers</p>
<p>Passengers Can Avoid Getting Wet on Rainy Days</p>
<p>The Municipal Xingye Trust Company of this city is actively developing the municipal ferry business and facilitating the citizens. It has recently decided to build a double-decker pier on the Bund of Beijing Road, which is currently under construction and can be completed in mid-December of this year. A reporter from Dabaisha visited the company to inquire about the latest situation. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Adding Piers to Facilitate Citizens: According to the company's spokesperson, in view of the increasing number of passengers on the ferries to and from the east and west banks of the Huangpu River, especially the ferries on the Gaoqiao-Wusong line, which are very crowded, and because there are no awnings at the piers along the Bund except for the Customs pier, passengers often suffer from the inability to avoid the rain on rainy days, it was decided to add a double-decker floating pier on the Bund of Beijing Road. It is currently being built by the Hexing Iron Factory on Hujunying Road in the South City. The total cost is 70,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Novel Equipment to be Completed by the End of the Year: The bottom layer of the pier has been built, and the upper layer is currently under construction. The project is scheduled to be completed and put into use on December 15th of this year. As for the equipment, such as waiting rooms, etc., which is unprecedented in the piers in Shanghai, will be fully equipped. Even on rainy days, passengers waiting for the ferry at the pier will not have to worry about getting wet. In the future, the pier will be specially used for ferries on the Wusong-Gaoqiao line. Passengers traveling in first-class cabins will board and disembark from the upper layer, and first- and second-class passengers will enter and exit from the bottom layer. The convenience for passengers will be several times greater than it is now.</p>

We forwarded it to your department for verification and handling. We then approved the reply and forwarded it to the Shanghai China National Products Production and Sales United Company and the National Products Factory Federation for verification and direct mailing. According to Comrade Zhang's letter, we have now received samples from Shanghai Wuzhou Pharmacy, Battery Company, and ABC Western Clothing Company. However, our national products, in the American market, are still easier to sell as silk, tea, porcelain, medicinal materials such as Sichuan ephedra and tung oil, and Suzhou embroidery and Hangzhou silk products.' Accordingly, we are sending a copy of Comrade Zhang's address in the United States and requesting that you check and notify the national product manufacturers to discuss and handle the publicity of silk, tea, porcelain, medicinal materials, embroidery, silk products, and other samples and price lists."</p>

<p>Due to Damage to Farmland</p>
<p>In the Shisitu area east of Caohejing Town in Shanghai's western suburbs, a Ningbo native named Wang Xifan leased more than ten mu of land this spring and established the Central Coke Factory. He dug pits in the ground, row upon row, storing bituminous coal and burning it day and night. The flames reached the sky, and smoke filled the fields. Tens of mu of cotton trees around the factory withered. At this time of autumn harvest, farmers are already suffering after a major drought, and disaster has already struck. Unexpectedly, they are facing this calamity again, with natural and man-made disasters coming together. Dozens of affected farmers in the area, including Wang Huanlou, Hu Fugui, Xu Linsheng, and others, feel their livelihoods are completely cut off and are extremely anxious. Therefore, yesterday they brought the old and the young to the Caojing District Municipal Committee Office, requesting that measures be taken to ban the factory. At the same time, they jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Government and the Public Security Bureau, ordering the factory to relocate to maintain agriculture, they said.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Municipal Public Security Bureau Schedules Reorganization of District Offices into Branch Bureaus <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>District Heads Become Branch Bureau Chiefs, District Staff Become Bureau Staff</p>
<p>Powers and Responsibilities Remain Unchanged from September 15th</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau's jurisdiction includes Nanshi Guanqiao District 1, Ximen District 2, Pudong Lannidu District 3, Zhabei Changan Road District 4, Baoshan Road District 5, Huxi Caojiadu District 6, Wusong Town District 7, and 23 branch offices (excluding police stations), all directly under the jurisdiction of Bureau Chief Wen Hongen. Bureau Chief Wen, based on the resolution of the National Police Affairs Conference of the Ministry of Interior last year, will uniformly change the existing district structure of the public security bureaus of various provinces and cities into branch bureaus. Currently, the public security bureaus of Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and other places have already implemented the changes in their respective districts in accordance with the resolution. Therefore, Wen believes that it is also necessary to change the names of the districts in this city. It is planned to change Pudong Gaoqiao into the 8th Branch Bureau. As for the city's original 23 branch offices, they will be renamed as police stations of a certain road according to their location and street name. This has already been approved by the Municipal Government and is scheduled to be implemented. It was originally scheduled to start on September 1st (the day before yesterday), but due to some delays in handling the matter, it will probably be implemented starting on September 15th. Gaoqiao Wen Branch Bureau will be one of the branch bureuas, and all other districts will be changed to branch bureaus. The district head will be renamed as branch bureau chief, and the district staff will be called bureau staff. The branch offices will be renamed as police chiefs. The administrative powers and responsibilities will remain the same as the original regulations, it was said.</p>

<h3 id="e156">University Student Injures Dance Hostess, Appealing Unsatisfied Verdict <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>A certain Huang Naiwu, a 22-year-old university student from Jiangxi, had a romantic relationship with a dance hostess named Li Xiuying (also known as Gui Zhen, 21 years old this year) at the Dahai Dance Hall at 543 Haige Road. For the past two or three years, Li gradually cooled down towards Huang because Huang neglected his studies and squandered money excessively, ignoring her advice. Huang, having spent thousands of dollars on Li, felt deeply resentful after being abandoned and sought revenge. He purchased nitric acid and bribed Jiang A Da, a rogue from Suzhou living at 15 Jingye Lane, Sipaifang, in the city. On the evening of June 20th of this year, he gave the acid to Jiang and went to the Dahai Dance Hall, instructing Jiang to splash the acid on Li to disfigure her and vent his accumulated resentment. Unexpectedly, Jiang arrived at the dance hall in a hurry and mistakenly splashed the acid on another dance hostess, Qiu Lifei, a local. This caused severe burns and disfigurement to her head and body. The dance hall manager reported the incident to the police, and detectives, including Xu Guilin, rushed to the scene and arrested Huang and Jiang. They were sent to the Special No. 2 Court and prosecuted for incitement to injury and other crimes. The victim and the Dahai Dance Hall also hired lawyer Wu Peng as their agent to file an incidental private lawsuit, seeking damages of over 46,000 yuan. After the trial, Huang Naiwu and Jiang A Da were each sentenced to ten months of imprisonment. The incidental civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court for trial, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that Huang Naiwu is dissatisfied with the original verdict and has hired lawyer Zhu Dianqing to file an appeal with the original trial court to the Higher Third Branch Court. It is reported that the Special No. 2 Court, after receiving the appeal, has submitted the case file to the High Court, and a hearing will be held soon.</p>

<p>Chen Shuhui Takes Preemptive Action</p>
<p>Chen Shuhui, a woman from Hunan, is just nineteen years old, with delicate features, fashionable Western clothes, a bobbed haircut, and leather shoes. At first glance, she is known as a fashionable woman. Previously, because her godfather, Mr. Chen, worked in Shanghai, and because she had long admired the prosperity of Shanghai, she often thought of coming to Shanghai to work and live. However, because she was unfamiliar with the place and people, she had no opportunity and dared not act rashly. Song Yuqing, a native of Yuyao, who was wandering in Hunan and making a living by practicing medicine, happened to meet the girl in July. Seeing her beauty and charm, he harbored evil intentions and used seductive tactics every day. Knowing that the girl intended to go to Shanghai, he took the opportunity to entice her to come to Shanghai with him last month and hid her in a bungalow in a lime kiln in Xiaoshadu, western Shanghai. When the girl wanted to find her godfather, Song just prevaricated. In recent days, Song had been leading people to look at her, planning to sell the girl for a price. The girl discovered this, and yesterday she reported it to the police, who arrested Song and brought him back to the Sixth District. District official Xing interrogated them separately and decided to wait for the girl's godfather to arrive for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Record of Nanchang Headquarters' Tour and Recovery of Bandit Areas by Huang Yanpei and Jiang Hengyuan <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>I. In the summer of the 13th year of the Republic (1924), the Chinese Vocational Education Society held its annual meeting in Nanchang. After the meeting, colleagues initiated a visit to the military front lines of bandit suppression in southern Jiangxi. The group consisted of twenty-six people, with Yanpei and Hengyuan responsible for external liaison. The Nanchang Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, aware of this initiative, specially provided five cars for transportation and assigned Adjutant Yang Liu to provide care along the way. The destinations for the tour were Nancheng, Nanfeng, and Guangchang, with Guangchang being the most important, as it had been recovered for less than eighty days. The trip lasted only three days. On the morning of July 16th, they departed from Nanchang, traveling 180 li to Linchuan, and then 150 li from Linchuan to Nancheng. They spent half a day investigating in Nancheng and stayed overnight. The next day (the 17th), they left Nancheng, traveling 120 li to Nanfeng, and then 120 li from Nanfeng to Guangchang. They spent five hours investigating in Guangchang, and in the afternoon, they returned to Nanfeng for the night. Due to the late hour, they could not conduct extensive investigations. The next day (the 18th), they returned north from Nanfeng to Nancheng, staying for three hours, and then traveled from Nancheng via Linchuan, staying for one hour, before returning to Nanchang before sunset. In three days, they traveled 1,140 li, and the investigation work included roadside observations, on-site investigations, public talks, private talks, and newspaper exhibitions. During the investigation, they also sent a telegram to Shanghai. This is a general outline.</p>
<p>II. Nancheng was the location of the Northern Route Headquarters of the Bandit Suppression Army. Commander-in-Chief Gu Mosan, upon hearing of their impending arrival, specially designated the Catholic Church inside the West Gate as their residence. After arriving at noon, after lunch, Chief of Staff Han Chuzhen and Special Team Leader Kang Zhaomin of the Headquarters provided the group with a detailed account of the bandit suppression efforts in recent years and the political and educational facilities established in the recovered bandit areas. They also displayed a large cloth map, indicating the gradual shrinking of the bandit areas and the gradual encirclement by the National Army. Mr. Kang also stated that statistics showed that most of the Communist Party members were from Hunan Province, leading to the inference that the development of ordinary middle schools in Hunan Province over the past decade or so had resulted in a large number of middle school graduates having nowhere to go.</p>
<p>Nancheng was once occupied by the Communist Party a year ago. After its recovery, special attention was paid to the organization of civilian self-defense. The constructed bunkers were also extremely well-built. Zhang Bochang, the Eighth District Commissioner and concurrently the County Magistrate of Nancheng County, told the group about the training of civilian self-defense organizations. After 5:30 PM, he summoned able-bodied men from the urban and rural areas to give a speech at the South City Square and invited them to observe. With only one hour's notice, more than 2,000 able-bodied men gathered at the same time. Although all the weapons were old-fashioned, the order was neat and the spirit was full, which was very commendable. In the evening, Gu Mosan invited them to the headquarters to discuss the recent progress of the suppression in detail.</p>
<p>III. The next morning, they traveled south from Nancheng to Nanfeng. The car did not stop. Nanfeng, except for the county seat, was entirely occupied by the Communist Party last year. It had not been long since the four borders were cleared. South of Nanfeng, many abandoned fields were seen along the way. Upon entering Guangchang at Ganzhu Town, the fields were even more desolate. On the roads, there were more women than men. Slogans written on the walls everywhere were mostly smeared over with new ones, and the faint traces of the old ones still remained. At 10:00 AM, they arrived at Guangchang County, where Deputy Commander Luo Youqing of the Third Route Army, Army Commander Zhuo Ying, led a team to greet them at the station. They were taken to the headquarters, which was a renovated dilapidated ancestral hall, extremely clean. Upon hearing of their impending arrival, a tour schedule and a map of Guangchang were prepared in advance. A long table was set up to display various documents of the Communist Party obtained after the recapture of Guangchang, such as flags, documents, regulations, seals, and textbooks. After they were seated, Mr. Luo first told them about the situation in the communist areas and the post-recovery treatment methods, saying, "What we are fighting for with the Red Bandits is the people, the hearts of the people, not the bodies of the people. The people's power in the bandit areas can be roughly divided into three types. The first type is what we call local thugs and hooligans, who they call the proletariat. They are used and organized, given various privileges, and allowed to run rampant, recruiting them as claws and confidants. This type of person is abandoned by the government but used by the Communist Party. After the National Army recovers an area, this type of person will naturally leave with them. It is difficult to expect them to reform and return to us. They can only remain loyal to the Communist bandits to the end. However, this type of person is the smallest number. Since they cannot return, we don't need to expect them to return. The second type is landowners and merchants with some capital. This type of person is driven out and plundered by the Communist bandits, and mostly flees to other places. After the National Army recovers an area, they are extremely hopeful that they can return as soon as possible and resume their old businesses. However, in Guangchang, not many of this type of person have returned yet. After all, this type of person is also a minority in a county. The third type is the obedient and docile people who usually farm and work without any purpose. They follow the Communist bandits when the Communist bandits are there, and they follow the National Army when the National Army comes. This type of person accounts for the majority. What the National Army and the bandits are fighting for now is this type of people who account for the largest number. To win over this type of people, the first thing is to protect their residence and reassure their hearts. Therefore, [we must defend the land we gain and comfort the people we have], [we must recover the land and the hearts of the people at the same time]. This motto is the only creed of the National Army when suppressing bandits. The reason why the National Army's suppression of bandits was previously unsuccessful was partly due to the lack of bunkers and roads, and the inability to guarantee the safety of the people's residence after the recovery of the lost land, and partly due to the failure of the generals to fully pay attention to recovering the hearts of the people. Now, we are fully focusing on these two points, so that we will not lose the land we have gained again, and we will not let the people we have gained go away again."</p>
<p>Then, according to the tour schedule, Mr. Luo and others led them to visit one by one. First, they inspected the nearby battlefield. Mr. Luo pointed out where the fighting was the fiercest, where the capture was the most difficult, and where the soldiers suffered the most casualties, which was dizzying and frightening. Guangchang is a place of undulating mountains, the most dangerous. The Communist Party originally regarded this place as the gateway to the Soviet area, so when the Third Route Army of the Northern Route Army of the National Army attacked the county, the Communist Party relied on the entire First, Third, and Fifth Army Corps to desperately defend Yangmian Ridge in the northern suburbs of the county, repeatedly engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The battle was extremely fierce. The enemy suffered about 4,000 deaths or more, and the number of National Army also reached thousands.</p>
<p>After the Communist Party lost Guangchang, they were greatly frustrated. When they left, they left behind more than 2,000 women in the city. Half of the able-bodied men were coerced to leave, and half have now escaped and returned. There were also many deaths. The county's population was usually only 110,000, and now nearly one-third of them have left. Hundreds of refugees flee from the front every day. As the army advances, the front line is changed to the rear. All the refugees are mostly collected and sent away. There are still more than 400 refugees in the Guangchang Refugee Camp. Their registration fees are mostly from Ningdu, Shicheng, and Ruijin. The supply of rations is constant every day. When they visited, they saw one new refugee who had died on the way, which was also very tragic.</p>
<p>After the National Army recovered Guangchang, all the troops continued to advance as usual. When they visited, one front line reached Rishui Town and advanced towards Shicheng, while the other reached Toupi and advanced towards Ningdu, both about 30-40 li away from Guangchang. The road above Guangchang has been gradually built. The troops left behind are now engaged in the construction of an airfield. When they visited, they personally saw 8,000 to 9,000 people working hard under the hot sun, and division and brigade commanders were also working among them. The old county seat of Guangchang was destroyed by mountain floods during the Xianfeng period of the Qing Dynasty. The current airfield is using the open space of this abandoned city. The original county government was in the northeast corner of the city. When the Communist Party left, they set it on fire. The ruins were tidied up by the National Army and turned into a park, which was very clean and presentable.</p>
<p>Now in Guangchang city, small business owners are doing well because the army is gathered and there is a greater demand for goods. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon. The fundamental plan is still to hope that everyone will return to their hometowns and work their fields. Mr. Luo is also paying close attention to this and is currently planning a solution.</p>
<p>The Red Electricity built extremely strong bunkers north of Guangchang City, which have now been renovated by the National Army. There are still several slogans that have not been washed away, posted high on the walls. The most complete one says:</p>
<p>[Each person has a carrying pole, and every five people have a stretcher to go to the front to be commanded]. This is because during the fierce fighting, the people were forced to go to the front to rescue the wounded.</p>
<p>That afternoon, they rushed to visit in the hot sun for about two hours and returned to the headquarters to read the reactionary documents. Among them, the following points were noteworthy:</p>
<p>(1) All seals are round in shape, with inscriptions carved around the edges, and in the middle are symbols such as a hoe and a sickle, as displayed on the flags.</p>
<p>(2) The writing style of all lower-level documents is mostly incoherent.</p>
<p>(3) There are many simplified characters used in the documents, such as [團] (group) written as [团] and [穀] (grain) written as [谷].</p>
<p>(4) The textbooks are filled with articles instilling communism and inciting class struggle, especially in the second grade and above.</p>
<p>After the tour, Mr. Luo also gave them each a package of printed materials.</p>
<p>Mr. Luo also said that the slogans of the bandits used to be [Soldiers don't fight soldiers] and [Poor people don't fight poor people]. Since the loss of Guangchang, the slogans have changed, saying [Chinese people don't fight Chinese people] and [The White Army representatives come to cooperate in resisting Japan]. In the past, they were vigorously advocating the expansion of the Soviet area, but recently they have changed their slogans and are no longer saying that.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Luo also gave a very detailed analysis of the question of whether the Communist Party in Jiangxi, which is surrounded, will break out.</p>
<p>They were moved by Mr. Luo's description of the difficulties in handling post-recovery matters, the lack of economic resources and medicine. Yanpei and Hengyuan immediately drafted a telegram in their names to Shanghai, asking Mr. Shou, the chairman of the Shanghai Local Association, to raise thousands of dollars for medicines and to invite Dr. Pang Jingzhou to organize a rescue team to Guangchang to provide relief.</p>
<p>After their tour and discussion, they heard Division Commander Fan Zhesan Songfu say that a month ago, a company instructor who had come over with weapons from the Communist bandit army was specially called in for a talk. According to what he said: [My surname is Yin, I am from Tingsiqiao, Hubei. I am 22 years old. I was recruited into the army by Peng Dehuai when I was 19 years old. I served as a logistics soldier for a year. My parents are at home, and I have been married. I studied in a private school for two years and was a boy scout for a year. After joining the bandit army, I never communicated with my family. As a company instructor, I was only responsible for conveying orders, and I didn't know anything else. What the Communist Party usually says is all lies. Where is there any equality? There are five people who ran away with me. I initiated it. I have already communicated with my family since I arrived here.] Asked, [Have you remarried since you left home for so long?]. He replied, [The bandit army is not equal. Except for senior officers, no one is allowed to marry and bring family members.]. Asked, [Isn't there a women's comfort corps where you can freely fall in love?]. He replied, [That is absolutely not allowed.]. After visiting Guangchang, they traveled north at 5:00 PM and arrived at Nanfeng, already at dusk. This time, Army Commander Heng Bingwen wholeheartedly entertained them and prepared food and lodging for them. They only briefly discussed the recent bandit suppression situation with him and did not visit other places. The next morning, they returned to Nancheng to attend a lecture meeting at the invitation of the county's educational circles. After the meeting, Commander-in-Chief Gu Mosan personally came to greet them again and invited them to talk, discussing everything from the world situation to the current situation and future of China, speaking with great sincerity and earnestness. After the discussion, he provided them with lunch. After lunch, they went north and returned to Nanchang at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>V. After the tour, they had the following feelings:</p>
<p>1. The National Army's Efforts to Suppress the Communists Are Amazing: The recovery of Guangchang was a major turning point in the situation. The Communist Party considered Guangchang as the only important gateway to the north and swore to defend it to the death, but it was finally recovered. Today, they toured the bunkers, browsed the battlefields, and imagined the fierce fighting at that time, which was tragic. Guangchang has a stone wall nearby, which was bombed into a honeycomb shape, in which many lives were sacrificed. It is even more possible to see the general situation. The Toupi area, which the current National Army pushed to, was attacked at night a week before they went and fought hard for a day and two nights before being repulsed, which also shows a glimpse of the fierce battle.</p>
<p>2. Strict Military Discipline: They traveled 570 li by car, mostly through areas where large armies were gathered, but they never saw a single soldier or soldier wandering the streets. It was especially commendable that everything was clean and tidy everywhere.</p>
<p>3. Victory in Bandit Suppression: Senior generals said that bandit suppression was unsuccessful in the past. Now, how can they benefit from it? It is due to the implementation of four major policies: (1) bunker construction, (2) road construction, (3) summoning refugees, and (4) training the people. Although there are still ten counties in Jiangxi and Fujian provinces that have not been recovered, the morale is high and they no longer talk about the bandits with fear as before.</p>
<p>4. Comforting and Receiving Refugees Is Greatly Related to the Return of People's Hearts: Since the recovery of Guangchang, an average of two to three hundred people have come from the Red Area every day. They are mostly old, weak, women, and children. Generally, the Red Area deliberately lets them go out due to insufficient food in order to reduce the number of mouths to feed. The government then comforts and trains them, which is a great opportunity. The key to [recovering the land and the hearts of the people at the same time] lies here.</p>
<p>5. The Need for Relief Is Huge: Every time the National Army advances to a place, the number of refugees received and sent back is different. Just the minimum living expenses are already a burden. The fundamental plan is to restore production as soon as possible. However, they return to their hometowns alone, and their houses are gone. It is estimated that each household needs to be loaned at least 30 yuan to restore cultivation, which is an even greater amount. The Nanchang Committee is planning this.</p>
<p>6. The Need for Talent Is More Urgent: Senior generals said that they feel the need and lack of talent everywhere. When they went to the front, they also deeply felt the need to deal with a myriad of things. Under extremely serious circumstances, the military authorities responded in many ways and dealt with emergencies. Today's so-called generals are a combination of local, political, economic, and educational talents. At its root, it is only science. What a great spirit, and how heavy the responsibility! Talent is one problem, and organization is another. It can be said that this is one of the greatest experiments in which humans use groups to fight for survival. The senior generals seen on this trip are the best of their time and are admirable. August, 23rd year of the Republic (1934)</p>

<p>Record of the Eleventh Annual Meeting of the China Science Society</p>
<h3 id="e172">Society Affairs Meeting <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>President's Report: The Society Affairs Meeting was held at 9:00 AM on the 28th, attended by more than 80 members, including Ma Yinchu. It was chaired by President Ma Yinchu and recorded by Xu Zhaosun, the secretary of the general society. First, President Ma Yinchu reported on the progress of the Society's affairs over the past year, stating that the Society had not made much progress in the past year, and only a branch was established in Beiping. According to the Beiping branch, the organization began the year before last, and the preparatory procedures were completed last year. In addition, the Hangzhou branch has completed the reorganization of its site, and the garden lawns have been laid. The reading room is about to be established. The electric lights from the inner society and the water have been successfully added, and members will have more places to rest when they go to Hangzhou in the future. However, whether the library that the Society plans to build will be located in Hangzhou is still a question. As for the new members who joined this year, there are fifty or sixty people. Regarding the series of books published by the Society last year, there were fewer than in previous years, only two or three, and it is hoped that members will work hard. Regarding the Society's quarterly publication, the Commercial Press has been particularly generous to the Society before its publications can be soundly restored, partly because all the Society's members study economics and are highly regarded, and partly because Mr. Wang Yunwu, the manager of the press and a director of the Society, has also contributed. This is the general situation last year. Before the discussion of the Society Affairs Meeting this year, there are some additional items that should be noted and discussed: 1. Increase the manuscript fee for the quarterly. 2. The editor and affairs are currently concentrated on Tang Qingzeng, a member of the Society. It is advisable to add one person responsible for affairs or assistance.</p>
<p>Secretary's Report: The secretary of the general society then reported that the Society should have convened six regular meetings in the past year. Sixty-two new permanent members have been added, for a total of 273 permanent members, 350 ordinary members, and a total of more than 620 members. It was decided at last year's annual meeting to compile a list of the Society. Therefore, after the closing of the annual meeting, the Society sent out questionnaires separately, but to this day, less than a quarter of the questionnaires have been sent to the Society. Therefore, this investigation could not be carried out as desired, and the list could not be published earlier. We can only find another way to investigate, hoping for the coming year.</p>
<p>Treasurer's Report: The Economic Society's accounting is divided into two parts: one is the fund accounting, and the other is the ordinary accounting. The fund also has a separate fund management committee. Wang Zhixin of the fund accounting did not arrive, and the president reported on his behalf. At the same time, the fund accounting affairs are simple, and there are not many accounts in and out. There are currently more than 70,000 yuan in cash bonds, a special donation of 1,500 yuan, and a piece of land in Nanjing, which was originally purchased for 1,500 yuan and is now worth 30,000 yuan, for a total of more than 100,000 yuan. Then Zhang Sichuan, the ordinary treasurer, reported (accounts omitted). The meeting then appointed Pan Xulun to review the accounts. Then Tang Qingzeng, the editor-in-chief of the quarterly, reported (1) that although there was no significant progress in the editing part in the past year, fortunately it was still able to maintain its previous state. In the future, with increased funding, improvement will be easier, because nothing can be done without money. (2) Regarding the account part (accounts omitted), efforts should be made on advertising fees to get some subsidies.</p>
<p>Re-election of Directors: The term of the directors of the association, namely Yinchu, Wu Dingchang, and Shou Jingwei, expired this year. Jin Guobao was appointed to call the votes, and Pan Xulun and Wang Wei were appointed to record the votes. The mailed election ballots were opened, and the results showed that 187 election ballots were cast, with 3 invalid ballots. Pan Xulun, Wang Zhixin, and Zhou Zuomin were elected as directors. In addition, Tang Qingzeng, He Lian, Wang ChengYing, Li Peien, Sun Ji, and He Haoruo were elected as alternate directors. Xu Yongzuo was elected to the Fund Management Committee. In addition, Mu Ouchu, Zhang Weici, Jin Runquan, Yu Qiaqing, Shi Liangcai, Gu Yinong, and Xu Yongzuo were invited by the General Assembly to serve as economic members of the quarterly.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals: The Society Affairs Meeting discussed and resolved (1) the location of the next meeting, deciding on Sichuan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, to be decided by the board of directors; (2) the date and time of the annual meeting will not be changed and will still be held in August; (3) the quarterly will be changed to a bimonthly or a monthly publication if possible; (4) the manuscript fee for the quarterly will be increased from 300 yuan to 500 yuan; (5) the next quarterly will include the Hunan Economic Survey and Research Opinions at the end; (6) an additional 1,000 yuan will be given to Hunan University as a thesis prize for the Department of Political Economy (the method is to use 100 yuan interest as a prize each year); (7) Mr. He Yunqiao is invited to be a supporting director; (8) a telegram will be sent to Guizhou Province stating that they cannot go to visit due to road obstruction and will wait for another day. The meeting closed at 12:00.</p>
<p>Tour of Scenic Spots: On the same day, all members of the society were invited by the Hunan Provincial Party Department to a luncheon at the Provincial Government Guest House, and visited the Hunan Industrial Experiment Institute's National Goods Exhibition Hall, and toured the Changsha Anti-Communist Fortress Project's historical site, Tianxin Pavilion Park. In the evening, they attended a joint banquet hosted by the Hunan Provincial Banking Community. During the banquet, the Senior Class of the Technical Training Corps of the Western Route Bandit Suppression Headquarters performed martial arts. Governor He Jian personally performed, and the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until 11:00 PM before dispersing. The next day (the 29th), the Economic Society gave public speeches at the invitation of the Hunan Provincial Authorities. In the morning, Ma Yinchu, Chen Changheng, Pan Xulun, and Li Quanshi spoke. In the afternoon, Gan Naiguang, Liang Hancao, Zhang Mojun, Tang Qingzeng, and Du Changsha spoke at the Education Association Pingzhongshan Hall. The remaining members were divided into three groups to visit Changsha's industry, mining, and agriculture.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Recent News on the Preparation of the Central Library <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The preparatory office of the National Central Library was established last April and has been renting premises. Due to limited funding, it has not yet been able to find land to build a library building, and it is not easy to open exhibitions for the time being. Since the establishment of the library, it has been collecting books and newspapers from home and abroad, sorting them out, and compiling book catalogs. Currently, it has been collecting books and magazines from various ministries, departments, and commissions of the national government, as well as various provinces and cities. The collected books and magazines have been classified and compiled into a general catalog, which is currently being printed and will be published soon. It will be a grand view of publications from all Chinese government agencies. Regarding the exchange of foreign publications, after receiving the National Studies Bookstore, the library can exchange National Studies books for European and American books. Recently, it also took over the International Exchange Office for Publications of the National Central Research Institute, which was completed at the end of August and started work immediately. From now on, international exchange of books and newspapers can be handled directly, which is more convenient than before. This time, 100 boxes of international publications were received. Due to the limited space of the library, they are temporarily stored until suitable housing can be found for opening and exhibiting them.</p>

<p>First Phase of Construction Includes Eleven Schools</p>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondent) The Jiangxi Education Department believes that the school sites of middle and higher schools in the city are mostly insufficient. It has specially formulated a three-year construction plan to be implemented separately. The construction costs for this phase include eleven schools such as the Provincial Medical College. All construction funds of 100,000 yuan have been pre-paid by the Provincial Education Funds Management Office in the previous year and allocated in installments to start construction. This year, most of them can be completed uniformly. It is planned to send personnel to various schools to inspect and accept the completed construction projects after the schools report the completion of the construction projects. Another construction plan for the second phase will be formulated, and funds will be allocated to other schools for construction in order to achieve the effect of advancing at the same time in the overall planning.</p>

<p>Qiu and Lin Win, China Leads 2-1</p>
<p>The Championship to be Decided by the Final Two Singles Today</p>
<p>In the Rotary Cup Shanghai International Tennis Tournament, yesterday was the second day of the Sino-US finals. As a result of the doubles match, China defeated the United States with a straight set of three. Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua defeated Carlsen and Squair with a score of 6-4, 8-6, 8-6. Since both sides won a set in the two singles on the first day, China is now ahead of the United States with a score of 2-1. In the last two singles today, China only needs to win one more set to retain the championship.</p>
<h3 id="e193">The Victory of the Doubles Did Not Come Easily <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Sino-US doubles match was truly evenly matched. The situation was extremely balanced. The victory should have been easy for the two veterans Qiu and Lin to play, but due to a lack of cooperation, they only defeated Carlsen and Squair in extremely difficult circumstances. In the three sets, the American team took the lead repeatedly, and they all had a chance to win. Qiu and Lin's performance was also inferior, otherwise there would be no such dangerous situation.</p>
<p>First Set: Carlsen served first, and the servers all won. So, each side had one, two, three, and four points, with no one being able to gain an advantage. After 4-4, Carlsen's service game in the ninth game failed, and Qiu and Lin won the first set with a score of 6-4.</p>
<p>Second Set: The situation gradually became tense. Carlsen and Squair suddenly took a 2-0 lead. After Qiu and Lin equalized, the situation of 3-3, 4-4, 5-5 reappeared. At this time, Squair won with his serve, and thus took a 6-5 lead. The situation was dangerous. Among them, Qiu and Lin worked hard to cope, and won three consecutive games, reversing the situation and winning the second set with a score of 8-6.</p>
<p>Third Set: The situation in the third set was still the same. The servers won, 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5, and 6-6. The air was tense, and no one was sure. Just when it was thought that Qiu and Lin might lose a set, they broke Carlsen's service game in the thirteenth game and were able to win the third set with a score of 8-6.</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua (China) 6-4, 8-6, 8-6 Carlsen and Squair (USA)</p>

<h3 id="e200">On Advocating Literature <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>Not long ago, a gentleman saw the phrases "If literature doesn't die, disaster won't cease" and immediately protested loudly. He also complained that the government had not invested in literature; he said that the country sends students abroad to study science, but science hasn't flourished, yet the country hasn't advocated for literature.</p>
<p>This statement, in reality, isn't entirely true. From ancient times to the present, hasn't the "ruler" always promoted literature? To put it further back, in ancient times, any enlightened ruler who "valued literature" would give literary people high positions: This is a "common historical occurrence"; even if some literary people couldn't comprehend the "emperor's heart," as long as they could provide entertainment for the emperor, they would inevitably be rewarded with a small official position: This can also be verified by history. Only a foolish ruler like Emperor Yang of Sui would kill literary people because he couldn't create good lines like "Swallows fallen from the empty beam," but Emperor Yang ultimately lost his country. He didn't understand the rules of being an emperor; being an emperor means "promoting" literature, not competing with literary people in intelligence.</p>
<p>Historical records testify to this. Looking at contemporary measures, take the massive recent budget as an example. The amount of money spent on promoting literature is indeed too small. But, unbeknownst to some, in today's impoverished rural areas, being able to spend a little money on literature already shows enthusiasm for promotion. Or do some think that loyal literary people should have official positions, but because they don't, that is seen as not promoting literature? Unbeknownst to some, this way of thinking is also a bit of an "anachronism." In ancient times with emperors, the method of promoting literature was to bestow official positions. Now, we are a modern country without an emperor, so how can we still use that old tune!</p>
<p>To sum it up in one sentence: In modern Chinese history, except for the reigns of Kangxi and Qianlong, no era has paid more attention to promoting literature than the present! However, Kangxi and Qianlong frequently displayed banners of "Imperial Approval" and "Imperial Decree" to highlight the characteristics of the imperial system. Now, in the Republic of China, there are naturally other methods of promotion.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Loneliness <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>Loneliness is like a bottomless abyss, filled with darkness. Loneliness is also like the shadow of the night, its form elusive.</p>
<p>One who deeply tastes loneliness is a lonely heart, a lonely heart like a seasoned and worldly-wise traveler. The more one returns from a lively place, the more one can taste the flavor of loneliness. The more bustling the past was, the more the ensuing loneliness feels lonely. If the bustle were to disappear, loneliness would fundamentally cease to exist in this world.</p>
<p>After the Parisian citizens' fervent revolution, the guillotine and the gallows followed. Consequently, a great shadow of loneliness deeply shrouded the hearts of all citizens. Following the bloody revolution in Soviet Russia, the ensuing economic recovery led to the suicide of the poet Mayakovsky, who couldn't adapt to the second wave of excitement. He was killed by a lonely heart.</p>
<p>We naturally also have our post-excitement loneliness, but this kind of loneliness is left for those who cannot speculate or adapt to savor.</p>
<p>Our era is an era of manufacturing loneliness. Turbulent times have disturbed the minds of the clever; layer upon layer of oppression has also disturbed the nerves of the weak. Thus, loneliness is a gift to both the clever and the weak.</p>
<p>The ignorant and the strong do not experience loneliness. If they do, it is a different kind of loneliness.</p>
<p>Clever people also have times when they are not lonely, such as when they sell their souls, or deceive or numb themselves in various ways. However, when the soul or drunken dream awakens, the loneliness at that time will be an extraordinary loneliness, accompanied by an unusually painful loneliness.</p>
<p>The result of loneliness is either suicide or madness, or at the very least it will cloud the mind, causing restlessness, making one feel there is nowhere to place even one's own body.</p>
<p>It is said that artists, literary people, and sensitive youths are most susceptible to "loneliness sickness," and there have been many examples of this throughout history. Because their hearts are not understood by people, their works are not appreciated by people, or a great era of sudden change makes them feel lost, they feel alone, bored, and feel the need to go mad or die. They are indeed killed by cleverness, but they are killed by loneliness.</p>
<p>When loneliness strikes, reason sometimes loses its effectiveness. A person without loneliness will never have loneliness. And for a person with loneliness, even if you put him in a crowded dance hall, dancing wildly, he will still feel lonely, or even a more intense loneliness.</p>
<p>However, the morbid state of loneliness is not entirely unavoidable. When a person is working intently and passionately, the shadow of loneliness avoids him; when the era is progressing towards upward brightness, the era will not have era-specific loneliness.</p>
<p>As for the motivation for writing this article, the purpose is clearly to kill a bit of loneliness in time.</p>
<p>"Let us not have loneliness!" was shouted loudly in a moment of deep loneliness.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Notes on Lili Kober (Part 1 Continued) <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>However, Shanghai is Shanghai, and China is China. Knowing Shanghai doesn't mean you know China. Before her trip to Beijing, Lili Kober ultimately knew nothing about China. Not only were her observations limited, but she hadn't even heard much from others.</p>
<p>This isn't entirely due to language barriers. She was born in Austria, studied at the University of Frankfurt in Germany, and German is her native language. In recent years, she worked at the Putilov Works factory in Soviet Russia, and she can also speak Russian, in addition to French and English. Shanghai has plenty of people who speak "English," so why couldn't she converse with many people? However, the question is what should people tell her? For example, the Mr. Willys she met, those kind and frequently cheerful, plump Western gentlemen, only told her things like:</p>
<p>"Chinese people's lives are very good. They have no needs and no worries. They have enough to eat and are often very happy. Yes, these ragged people, at first glance, seem very unpleasant. But after getting used to each other, you don't feel anything. If you live here long enough, you'll get used to them too."</p>
<p>How to get used to them? For example, when Mr. Willy takes a rickshaw on Nanjing Road and a piece of sweet potato peel suddenly flies over and dirties his clothes, he can jump out of the rickshaw and randomly grab a Chinese person to beat, or call the tall Indian policemen wearing turbans to arrest people. Or, when walking on the road and running into a Chinese person, the Chinese person should give way, not Mr. Willy...</p>
<p>But these words made Lili Kober "angry." She didn't want to listen to them. What she wanted to hear were the words of Chinese people. However, the question came up again: what should the Chinese people tell her?</p>
<p>For example, even the situation in the Chinese literary scene that I'm very familiar with, when she asked me, I couldn't simply summarize it. My answer, written in words, took two nights of thinking.</p>
<p>We ourselves don't really know what method we can use to tell others about everything. Therefore, whenever foreign guests come to China, even if they are investigators, we often treat them as "encyclopedias" and interrogate them, leaving them no time to interrogate us.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw shook the world, creating excitement everywhere, that was natural. Even if black Hughes or French Zhang Henshui or Georges Ebella came to China, they wouldn't be neglected. But someone as desolate as Kober was truly unprecedented. When she first arrived in Shanghai, she had to find the Soviet consulate, and the consulate introduced her to a news agency, and Mr. C from the news agency introduced her to a few literary youths. Only then did she find an American school and stay there. Mr. C once treated her to a delicious meal at the New Asia Restaurant. After that, there was only one public banquet by three literary groups. The number of guests attending this public banquet was only five, which was very dishonorable. Although this also fortunately avoided many smoky attacks, the scheduled dishes were not finished after all, which she and everyone else felt was a pity.</p>
<p>Before taking their seats, when talking about The True Story of Ah Q, she asked caringly about the recent situation of the author of this novel. I said with a smile:</p>
<p>"He's coming soon."</p>
<p>Because I knew that the person in charge that day had invited Mr. Lu Xun, she was so happy that she was almost excited. However, in the end, Mr. Lu Xun didn't come, saying that he had suffered from heatstroke and couldn't come out. Although Kober didn't express it at the time, two days later, when Mr. Ren went to visit her, she asked with regret:</p>
<p>"Was Mr. Lu Xun's absence because he looked down on me?"</p>
<p>After listening to Mr. Ren's explanation of the real reason, she was happy again.</p>

<p>— Hua Yu</p>
<p>(8) How to Hand Over?</p>
<p>The fact of handing over writing to the masses already existed since the late Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>"[Don't beat the drum, don't beat the gong, listen to me sing a song of peace...]" was a sanctioned folk song for educational affairs; in addition, scholar-officials also ran some vernacular newspapers, but the idea was only that everyone should understand it, not necessarily be able to write it. "The Thousand Character Primer for Common People" carried a hint of the possibility of being able to write, but it was only enough for keeping accounts and writing letters. If you wanted to write out what you were thinking in your heart, its limited number of characters was not enough. For example, prison indeed gives people a piece of land, but it has restrictions, only allowing you to stand, sit, lie down, and rest within this circle, and you absolutely cannot run out of the established iron fence.</p>
<p>Lao Nai'an and Zhao Yuanren both had simplified characters, which were very advanced and could write words according to their sounds. At the beginning of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Education wanted to create an alphabet. They were both members. Mr. Lao sent a representative, and Mr. Wang came in person. For the issue of the preservation or abolition of entering tones, he had a great battle with Mr. Wu Zhihui, a battle that made Mr. Wu's stomach cave in and his cotton pants fall down. But in the end, after several deliberations, they created something called the "National Phonetic Alphabet." At that time, many people thought it could replace Chinese characters, but in reality it still didn't work, because it was ultimately just a simplified version of square characters, just like Japanese "kana." It's okay to insert a few or annotate them next to Chinese characters, but if you want it to be the main force, it will be mixed up when writing and will strain your eyes when reading. The members at that time called it the "National Phonetic Alphabet" because they deeply knew its range of ability. Looking at Japan again, they have those who advocate reducing Chinese characters and those who advocate pulling together the alphabet, but no one advocates using only "kana."</p>
<p>A better approach is using Romanization. Zhao Yuanren is the most sophisticated scholar of Romanization, but I don't quite understand it. Using the world-renowned Roman alphabet [now even Turkey has adopted it], each word is a string, very clear, which is good. But to a layman like me, it seems that the spelling is still too cumbersome. To be precise, it inevitably has to be cumbersome, but being so cumbersome makes it "difficult" again, which hinders popularization. It would be best to have another kind of simple but not crude thing.</p>
<p>We can study this kind of new "Romanization" method. There is a small book called "Latinization of Chinese Writing" in "Daily International Literature Selections," and a copy of "Language Science" recorded in the combined issue of the 6th and 7th issues of "World" in the second year, which both introduce this thing. The price is cheap. Those who are interested should buy it and read it. It only has twenty-eight letters, and the spelling is easy to learn. "Person" is Rhen, "house" is Fangz, "I eat fruit" is Wu Chgoz, "He is a worker" is Ta shgungrhen. It is now being tested among overseas Chinese and has seen results. It's just Northern Mandarin. But I think that after all, more people in China speak Northern Mandarin [not Beijing Mandarin]. In the future, if there really is a common language that is used everywhere, the main force will probably still be Northern Mandarin. For now, just make some reasonable additions and subtractions to make it consistent with the sounds unique to each locality, and it can be used in any remote rural area.</p>
<p>Then, as long as you recognize the twenty-eight letters, learn a little spelling and writing, anyone can write and understand it, except for lazy people and those with low abilities. Moreover, it also has a good advantage, which is that it writes quickly. Americans say that time is money; but I think: time is life. Pointlessly wasting other people's time is actually no different from plotting to take money and lives. However, people like us sitting and enjoying the cool breeze, chatting idly, are an exception.</p>

<p>"Younger brother, don't gamble with those soldiers, brother!" I said.</p>
<p>"Um, um,..." one sentence.</p>
<p>"Younger brother, if you have nothing to do, brother will teach you some books," I said again.</p>
<p>"Um, um,..." two sentences.</p>
<p>I said again.</p>
<p>"Younger brother..."</p>
<p>"Um,..." he widened his big eyes, took the lighter I gave him that I had just bought from the provincial capital, and left again.</p>
<p>Later, I often heard about him gambling with the soldiers, even quarreling. Everyone was very worried. Coincidentally, at this time, the troops on our side started a war with the troops stationed in our hometown, and they had already won on the front line. That relative said happily:</p>
<p>"Good, when they attack your hometown, your mother will lock him up!"</p>
<p>When going on patrol on the road, I really wanted to call him to go with us to the rear, but I couldn't find him anywhere; I was especially worried on the day of the attack on my hometown, Lion Tiger Ridge. The opposing troops were holding the ridge tightly, scattering a line of skirmishers several miles long along the ridge, looking down at a small market town that we were approaching. Standing at the head of the town, the bridgehead on the ridge could be seen clearly in the middle of the charge, bullets whizzing past our heads like bees. It is said that our advance troops have already charged up, and that relative has also charged up, from the front. Oh, my younger brother is only fourteen years old, how can those small hands operate that small gun!</p>
<p>When we defeated the enemy and entered the city, stepping on many dead and half-dead bodies, my eyes searched urgently among them. On the road, I grabbed this person and asked, grabbed that person and asked. When I got home, my mother said that my younger brother rode a wild horse into the city with the troops, and he looked pitifully small on the horse, but as soon as he came back and ate half a bowl of rice, he jumped back on the horse and ran off as if he was afraid of being caught by someone. Although, my mother's words carried a bit of pride. Because there were neighbors around, she spoke even louder.</p>

<h3 id="e207">How to Rescue the Current Disaster Victims <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Duan Sheng</p>
<p>Floods and droughts are unpredictable, and disasters have occurred in every era. Therefore, a good government must make these unpredictable floods and droughts, and the disasters that occur in every era, gradually disappear without a trace, preventing them before they happen. If rescue only begins after a disaster has already occurred, the people have already suffered.</p>
<p>The ancient ways of disaster relief mostly drew from the "Famine Administration" section of the Zhou Rituals, with additions and subtractions. The Famine Administration has eleven aspects: first, distributing benefits; second, reducing taxes; third, delaying punishments; fourth, easing labor demands; fifth, relaxing trade restrictions; sixth, eliminating unnecessary controls; seventh, reducing ceremonial observances; eighth, suppressing mourning; ninth, increasing music; tenth, encouraging marriage; eleventh, seeking divine guidance; twelfth, eliminating bandits. As for how those in positions of authority should handle a world of disaster and famine:</p>
<p>The Record of Rituals, Jade Ornaments says:</p>
<p>[If the year is unfavorable, the ruler wears coarse cloth and a hairpin of plain wood, levies no tolls on bridges and passes, does not tax mountains and marshes, suspends public works, and high officials are not allowed to build carriages.]</p>
<p>Mozi says:</p>
<p>[In lean years, officials from scholars and officials down lose one-fifth of their salaries; in droughts, they lose two-fifths; in calamitous times, they lose three-fifths; in times of scarcity, they lose four-fifths; in great famines, they receive no salary at all, only food.]</p>
<p>Guliang Zhuan says:</p>
<p>[In the rituals of great famine, the ruler does not eat elaborate meals, platforms and pavilions are not plastered, the roads to the watchtowers are neglected and not cleared, officials wear plain clothes, sacrifices to spirits are reduced. These are the rituals of great famine.]</p>
<p>It is clear that ancient disaster relief had established rules. Compared to those who see a disaster and do not help, or use disaster relief solely for their own benefit, how should one proceed? Those in positions of authority should reduce salaries, decrease their meals, and forgo entertainment in disaster years, to show that they share the people's suffering. This is better than later generations, who only hear the sound of disaster relief but see no one doing it, and still indulge in extravagance, debauchery, drunken singing, and senseless behavior as before. The "Cloud Han" poem in the Book of Songs is a work of King Yi of Zhou lamenting drought and disaster; later generations still read it with deep longing, and the people of that time could not but sympathize. This is why he was able to achieve a middling reign. The poem says:</p>
<p>[The drought is excessive, the mountains and rivers are parched. The drought demon rages, like fire and burning. My heart dreads the heat, my anxiety is like smoke. The assembled officials do not heed me. Oh, Heavenly God, would that you would let me escape!]</p>
<p>Even in later dynasties, even the most immoral rulers would issue edicts blaming themselves when faced with great droughts and disasters. Although they were acting insincerely, they at least showed some concern for the disaster victims.</p>
<p>The present age is not the ancient age, and the intentions of the people of today are not the same as those of the ancients. Moreover, the disasters of today are no less severe than those of ancient times. Those who suffer the most are usually the areas known for their wealth and prosperity. However, they are either suffering from the aftermath of war or the aftermath of great disasters, struggling to recover. The bankruptcy of rural areas and the emptiness of granaries are a common phenomenon. The arrival of drought is like adding frost to snow, suffering displacement only to face wandering. People are reduced to lifelessness, plagued by hunger and cold, and either contemplate murder or resort to desperate measures. All of this is a loss to the state and society, and a breeding ground for chaos.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the twentieth year of the Republic (1931), great floods affected the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, and Henan. At that time, the emotions of those who heard of the disaster and rose to provide relief were passionate and intense. The scope of this year's drought is greater than the great flood of 1931. The damage suffered by the disaster victims, while not as complete as the washing away of fields, houses, livestock, and tools by the great flood, is no less severe than the aftermath of the great flood, considering the thousands of miles of barren land, the lack of harvest, and the interruption of life. Western Zhejiang is known for its wealth, but in recent years, farmers have mostly used miscellaneous grains for food and filled their bellies with sweet potatoes and taro. The reason is that agricultural products are worthless and silk cocoons are not moving, leaving them with almost no income. Moreover, exorbitant taxes and levies are the ultimate burden on farmers. All daily necessities, from needles to thread, depend on the cities, which in turn rely on foreign countries. Money only flows out of the rural areas and does not come in. It would be against all reason if they did not go bankrupt. Now, they are hit by a severe drought. Initially, rice seedlings were planted everywhere, and everyone hoped they would survive, so they spared no effort in watering them day and night, hoping that heaven would send rain and a harvest. However, heaven ultimately did not send rain, and the rivers and ponds dried up. Not only was there no water to irrigate the rice, but there was also a serious problem with drinking water. At this point, the efforts and debts of the farmers were all absorbed by the scorching sun, leaving them with nothing. Countless people are lying in bed, starving and waiting for help. Countless people are seeking a livelihood in the cities (which are already suffering from unemployment and cannot accommodate everyone). Countless more are preparing to flee to the four directions. However, society is indifferent to this, and the authorities are oblivious. The arrival of a flood is vast and overwhelming, engulfing mountains and hills, like an acute illness that is frightening and indescribable, deeply stimulating and easily arousing sympathy. A drought is like a slow-acting disease, lingering and unnoticed. People underestimate it, but as its symptoms deepen day by day, it becomes impossible to remedy. However, the biggest reason for society's indifference is the depression of all industries and the helplessness of all undertakings, which is not just the case with droughts. In addition, the success of previous disaster relief efforts must be attributed to the mobilization of various charities in Shanghai. However, in recent years, there have been too many relief efforts, with huge expenditures. Revenues have also been affected by the depression of all industries, making it impossible to raise funds. Most well-known charities are in debt. Therefore, apart from setting up altars to pray for rain, there is little active relief work. Compared to the great flood of 1931, when various charities distributed relief and the municipal government set up shelters, the enthusiasm is much less now! This is also a sign of the downturn in relief efforts. Therefore, the drought is becoming more and more serious, while Shanghai is in a state of peace and happiness. Apart from the high price of grain, it is hard to see any signs of disaster. It is thought that major cities are the same. Therefore, there is an indication that there is no need to restrict the price of rice, because they only see the superficial prosperity of the cities and have not seen the tragic and profound reality of the rural areas. Therefore, in the present age, being able to provide relief after a disaster has already occurred is still considered good governance. Preventing disasters before they happen is far beyond reach.</p>
<p>Relieving disasters is like putting out a fire, which speaks to the urgency of the situation. If it is delayed, the people will be displaced and become starving corpses on the side of the road. The disaster today is also urgent. Paper publicity never fails to proclaim prosperity; relief plans never fail to be grand. But if we wait for the success of the plan before starting relief, will we not be seeking our people in a dried fish shop? The ancients believed that official relief was inferior to voluntary relief, because official relief involved complicated procedures, such as investigating the disaster from the county, then the prefecture, then the circuit, then the governor, then reaching the department, then submitting a memorial, then receiving a reply, and then distributing relief. The process was cumbersome, slow, and criticized by the world. However, there are also ways to remedy the situation, such as local officials assessing the disaster and issuing timely relief from the granaries, which is called urgent relief. Therefore, if local officials truly value the livelihood of the people, they should consider how to handle the situation when the disaster is developing or has already occurred, starting from the moment the disaster signs appear. If they cannot plan in advance and do not think of exerting effort when the disaster strikes, even if the disaster is not deep, such delays will inevitably deepen it.</p>
<p>The government's disaster relief is a kind of repayment for the people's contributions. Since the people usually contribute their wealth to the government, when there is a real disaster and they have no food, the government should use public funds to help the people. In the past, in years of disaster, the government would exempt taxes, issue grain from the granaries, divert the grain tribute, and use regular funds. If that was not enough, it would allocate funds from the imperial treasury or seek assistance from neighboring provinces. However, due to the corruption of the bureaucracy, disaster relief became a shortcut for officials to get rich, and the benefits did not reach the people. However, this is different from those who lack conscience and ignore the disaster.</p>
<p>Disaster relief must start with investigating the disaster. If the investigation is thorough and detailed, the disaster relief will be effective. If the disaster situation is unclear, there is no way to provide relief; if the disaster victims are unclear, there is no way to implement relief. Therefore, whether it is work relief, loan relief, distribution relief, cooking relief, or sheltering and comforting, unless the local disaster depth, strength, number of elderly, weak, strong, young, classification of the poor, village to town distances, general situation of the society, is clearly understood, it is difficult to obtain an effective plan. Disaster investigation is the basis for disaster relief. If the disaster investigation personnel do not conduct on-site inspections, even if they do, and their experience is insufficient, once they enter the countryside, the environment suddenly changes, and they are at a loss as to what is important and what is not. And the disaster victims know that the purpose of the disaster investigation is to provide relief, they often fabricate disaster situations, over-report the number of people, and prepare for a place to request relief. The difficulties in this are described in detail by the ancients, and it is not difficult to consult relevant books on famine administration.</p>
<p>Regarding disaster situation investigations, it seems that it should be more convenient than before. Towns and villages already have full-time personnel such as district chiefs, as well as local police and baojia, etc. If they do it practically, it will not be difficult to complete. However, the easiest places to create problems in investigation:</p>
<p>(1) Investigators do not conduct practical inspections, and create behind closed doors; for example, some say that when checking the household registration, they multiply the number of households by [eight], and when asked why, they say [a family of eight can be without hunger], every family has eight members, so multiply by eight. This kind of scheme to fabricate household registration books is especially common when handling elections. If disaster investigation is also done like this, it is no different from not investigating, and will only lead to failure.</p>
<p>(2) Local government officials, in order to shirk responsibility in the future, always like to report the disaster situation as too serious. If the disaster situation investigation in the future is not as severe as reported, they will cover it up by reducing the report. If they do not investigate, they can get more relief funds. Recently, many counties have reported disasters with exaggerated words, and many have been revealed by higher authorities, which shows that the county officials' reports of famine cannot be fully believed. Some county officials report disasters, but still do not know what the disaster is.</p>
<p>(3) After the disaster investigation, it is necessary to add a re-investigation. This is for serious disaster relief, so that those with minor disasters do not get more relief benefits, and those with serious disasters do not cry silently. It should be done quickly, and actions should not be slow, and procedures should not be cumbersome. It is important to know that the disaster victims are eagerly awaiting relief, and providing relief one day earlier will reduce their suffering by one day.</p>
<p>Before the investigation and survey, for serious disaster relief that cannot be delayed, start with emergency relief first, and then conduct regular relief. The length of the relief period depends on the severity of the disaster, the local situation, and the time when the new grain enters the market. As for the method of relief, it is no more than the following:</p>
<p>Relief (A) Work relief | Relief through work (B) (1) Food (2) Silver (3) Clothing (4) Medicine (C) Cooking relief porridge (D) Price control | Rice (E) Loan relief Food seeds farm capital (F) Sheltering | Supply food and lodging</p>
<p>Work relief is to provide wages for labor. In drought years, work relief is used to dredge rivers and dig ponds, which is the best policy for preventing future floods and droughts. However, this is limited to the strong, and the elderly and weak cannot receive relief, and those who are unable to do labor cannot receive relief. Providing relief by distributing food and money on the spot should vary according to the situation. If food is very scarce and it is very difficult to obtain food, then food should be provided as relief. If local transportation is convenient, but there is poverty after the disaster and people cannot afford to buy food, then money should be provided as relief. Cooking relief has both advantages and disadvantages, and the ancients discussed it in detail. I believe that for temporary emergencies, porridge relief may be possible. If the relief period is longer, porridge factories cannot be set up everywhere, and those who seek food still have the hardship of traveling and being rejected. From a human perspective, it is better to give them money and let them dispose of it freely. Price control can only be implemented when the price of rice is high and it is difficult to buy food, but not to the point where people cannot afford to buy it. If the disaster is already deep and the people are all poor, how can they afford to buy food with price control? Therefore, when the disaster is already deep, there is only one way to provide relief. Loan relief and distribution relief, one is gratuitous; the other is for repayment | repayment in the future. Before the investigation proves that there is no disaster, and the people have difficulty in food, the standard is to get relief rice. I believe that in the current situation of serious disaster and difficult fundraising, it is possible to consider the situation of the disaster victims and implement loans in parallel. Seeds are very important for the harvest in the coming year, but in disaster years, they are often used to fill hunger for emergency relief. It is best for the government to issue them free of charge, and only resort to loans as a last resort. After the disaster, the people lack agricultural capital, so we should prepare to establish agricultural loans in local areas or credit cooperatives, so that the disaster farmers can receive assistance, so as not to hinder the progress of their cultivation. In the future, there will be a harvest, and there will be granaries to maintain it, so that there is no need to worry about low grain prices harming farmers. As for sheltering, it should be limited to the elderly, weak, women and children who are difficult to survive. Sheltering is not easy to handle. When crowds gather in one place, it is easy to cause trouble, and it is also easy to cause epidemics, which is costly and difficult. Therefore, if there are places to stay and not be displaced, it is possible to provide more relief without sheltering. If there is a danger of women and children being sold, and the elderly and weak have the pain of being displaced, it is necessary to provide sheltering.</p>
<p>The ways to relieve disasters are not the same, and the way to implement them should also be considered by the relief workers according to the situation of each area. However, because people's hearts are difficult to predict, and the people's situation is complicated, there is no good policy for relief, which is a common lament of ancient and modern times. Therefore, whether the relief is really beneficial to the disaster victims depends on whether the relief workers are sincerely coming to relieve the disaster. Those who have sympathy for the disaster victims will definitely think of reducing the suffering of the disaster victims, and the disaster victims will receive more benefits, and vice versa. However, given the extent of the disaster area, how can we get all the right people? The good and the bad are mixed together, which is also the same in ancient and modern times. Especially those who are self-interested and accustomed to encroaching. The feeling of having governance but no one to govern, and the changed appearance of a butcher who eats disasters regardless of the suffering of the disaster victims, can we guarantee that there will be none today, I am afraid there will be more. So when providing relief, how can we not hope that those responsible will be cautious in selecting people! Do not think that it is a good idea to place relatives and friends, and do not call for voluntary service. Voluntary service cannot last long. Not all relief workers are like the presiding officers who do not worry about their livelihoods and take benevolence as their mission. They mostly come to solve temporary livelihood problems. Even if it is not for livelihood, their travel expenses, food expenses, and accommodation also cost money, so it is necessary to give some public funds. Therefore, voluntary service can only save those who take benevolence as their mission, and cannot be required of all full-time relief workers. Relief workers often use relief funds for disaster relief, and should make every penny reach the disaster victims, so the intention of saving the living expenses of relief workers is good. But do not think that relief workers have difficulty in living, or encroach secretly, or even waste publicly, then the damage to the relief funds is even greater. If it is known that they are maintaining their lives and encroaching on the funds, and they are not investigated, then it is tacitly allowed that there is no wrongdoing, which is even more unreasonable. Zhen the treasure relief funds, is the responsibility of the relief workers, and those who donate money and food are for disaster relief, not for relief workers, so no relief funds should be used for relief workers. But rather than the name of voluntary service that is actually dirty, why not pay a reasonable salary, strictly control their income and expenditure examination for more healing. The most suitable method is that the relief public funds are paid from local public funds, except for the various sales groups or individuals who voluntarily undertake them, and the relief personnel are transferred from local public officials (belonging to party and government local autonomy organs and various public groups). These all have their deserved salaries, and serving the local area to provide disaster relief is also their duty, (if they always want to show that they are public officials, using them to provide disaster relief, there are more failures than successes, this should also be considered.) As for the expenses of the relief headquarters and the funds used for starting relief, they should be paid from the provincial treasury or the national treasury, so that the relief funds donated by all parties can be used on the disaster victims.</p>
<p>Relief is difficult, fundraising is also difficult, the public hope that those with money will give money, and those with strength will give strength, to benefit the disaster victims, it is necessary that the disaster situation has aroused the sympathy of the general public, and the relief workers can gain the trust of all parties. In recent years, all industries have been depressed, and many are strong on the outside but weak on the inside, so fundraising is even more difficult, but given the extent of the disaster area and the severity of the disaster, where will the funds come from, this has to depend on the fundraising of all parties, the source of the funds, no more than</p>
<p>(1) Central allocation | Like the old days of using regular items to issue inner treasury funds.</p>
<p>(2) Provincial treasury allocation | Allocation of provincial taxes and issuance of public bonds, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Local public funds | This includes county funds and all local public funds and public property.</p>
<p>(4) Mortgage loans | This is like the old days of diverting grain tribute for relief</p>
<p>(5) Fundraising for relief | This is obtained by soliciting donations from all walks of life.</p>
<p>These five sources need not be described too much. Only the (3) and (4) two types need to be slightly elaborated. Relief is best to be agile, three in the morning and four in the evening, indecision is not possible, and even migration delays are not possible. Therefore, fundraising for disaster relief, only those with personal interests, or witnessing the depth of the disaster, can work hard. Therefore, the center of disaster relief should focus on the disaster-stricken county. The county's financial resources are not sufficient, so please help from all sides. And should first use its existing to provide relief. Now that all parties are having difficulties, the county treasury does not have much money, so it should use local public funds and public property. Local public funds and public property are concentrated in one place, but many are also distributed to all parties. The so-called distributed, distributed to the hands of local gentlemen. Many local public funds and public property were originally used for a certain undertaking, and later the undertaking was stopped, and the funds and property were nominally retained, with the spirit of not returning for a thousand years and not relying on them for ten thousand years, in fact, it is no different from encroachment. By the time years pass and months pass, the local people do not know about this, then it becomes their private property, and people consider them to be wealthy gentry, and those who know it do not want to ask. These things are common in counties and towns. Now, in the time of heavy disaster and people's difficulties, regardless of what kind of public funds and public property, they should be ordered to hand them over, concentrate them for disaster relief, and those who conceal them will be allowed to be reported, and those who report them will be rewarded. If they can be gathered in one place, the number will definitely be considerable. If the public property cannot be immediately converted into money, fortunately there are banks everywhere. It is with [going to the countryside] as their popular slogan, you may want to mortgage loans to them to fill the relief, just like the old days of diverting grain tribute to save the disaster, now there is no grain tribute to divert, but if there were grain tributes in the counties, there is no name for grain tribute, but there is still its reality, so no matter whether it is to change the name, or to merge with other items, in short, there is the element of grain tribute in it. At this moment, waiting for top relief, is like longing for rain in a long drought, not knowing when to get it, even if relief is obtained, investigation, compilation, reporting, review, approval, allocation, distribution, and allocation of funds, to get to the disaster victims, do not know what year and what month? Those who live in high places, can know the depth of the disaster of the people, do not want them to have actions that disrupt order, such as robbing rice, sitting in large households, demanding food, causing trouble · · · · · · also can not bear their haggard to the point of death, such as exile, starvation, suicide by poisoning, or suffocation to death; also can not bear to see their parents and children separated, selling children and daughters; and for a time can not immediately raise huge funds to provide relief, then why not allow the counties to leave a year or two in the grain tributes that should be paid (this year's field tax, of course, to be exempted, after next year's harvest, can be collected), and in the conditional review of the loan conditions, the counties can borrow on their own, to save the dying disaster victims, it is also not a method, now what is used to provide disaster relief, mostly focus on leveling the rice price, followed by leveling the rice sale, even if the rice price is level, (how to level the price is still a problem) leveling the rice sale has been done, in the rural bankruptcy serious drought environment, disaster victims are mostly unable to buy, still have no food to eat, to starve to death. The second is to organize work relief, work relief is again in the investigation and measurement; and even if it is held, and the work is not in the disaster area, whether to immigrate to take the work? Furthermore, after a major disaster, there is always a major epidemic. This year's drought has been too long, rivers are dry, drinking water is very difficult, taking water only exists in the desolate water of ponds, many dig mud to find water, drilling wells to find springs. Taking drinks here, washing here, accumulation of dirt, must reach. Fortunately, although there are many dysentery symptoms, there is no major epidemic; but there are more and more patients, and how can we know if it will not spread for a long time? Thinking about the future and preventing it is also an action that should be taken in disaster relief.</p>
<p>The disaster is deep! Autumn harvest is hopeless, the future is long, and the disaster victims are wandering in the realm of life and death. The seasons are changing. Autumn goes to winter, and they point to ask about things, no clothes and no coarse clothes, how to end the year! What's more, there is no food? This is deeply hoped that all circles will send a mournful heart and start relief together. Especially hoping that those with responsibilities will think of the skin is gone, the hair is attached, hunger and blockage give birth to thieving hearts; if they all rise up and [eat begging rice], and shout [starving to death], then it is not easy to remedy, so this is not the time for grandstanding; the key is to quickly catch up and rescue the people from the mire.</p>
<h3 id="e208">The Necessary Understanding of the Issue of Silver Exportation by Wei Youpei <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The issue of silver exportation has, in recent days, garnered quite a bit of attention from society. There are numerous critics, discussants, and those attempting to prevent its outflow, and some overly assertive arguments may cause public anxiety. In reality, silver exportation didn't start today, although it is more pronounced today, it has never been a focus of attention. Therefore, before discussing this issue, I feel it's important to focus not on the immediate, temporary problem, but on the long-term, permanent one.</p>
<p>Regarding the current silver outflow issue, some scholars believe that the solution lies in managing the trade deficit. This theory is correct in principle, but the current silver outflow cannot be attributed solely to the trade deficit. This is because the international trade deficit is not a recent phenomenon, but a constant in trade history for decades. The deficit in the past seven months has been decreasing due to declining domestic purchasing power. The total trade deficit for the seven months was over 32.9 million, which is far less than the exported silver. Therefore, based on the historical trade deficit, the amount that should have been exported to balance international payments should be more than that. However, the current exports from Shanghai are only about one-third of the trade deficit.</p>
<p>From the perspective of those engaged in exportation, most are foreign banks. Foreign businesses generally do not deposit their earnings from international trade in Chinese banks. As a result of the trade deficit, large amounts of silver flow into foreign banks every day. If all the silver held this year and in previous years were to be exported, the total would certainly not exceed 100 million.</p>
<p>The silver that has flowed into foreign banks over the years is, in reality, the same as being exported. The only difference is that one is stored in Shanghai and the other is stored abroad. The current exports are merely due to the desire to profit from the exchange rate difference. This silver is being transported from Shanghai back to foreign countries, and has long been isolated from the Chinese market, so its export has no direct impact on China's financial market.</p>
<p>Of course, it must be acknowledged that not all of the exported silver belongs to foreign banks. Some is entrusted by speculative merchants. Why would speculative merchants entrust its exportation? Naturally, it's because the exchange rate between domestic and foreign silver prices offers a profit opportunity. What worries us is this speculative activity. Because silver exportation due to the trade deficit is predictable, but these speculators will continue exporting as long as the exchange rate is not balanced. Therefore, even if the trade deficit is managed and reduced, these speculators cannot be eliminated. Therefore, to stop silver outflow, the solution lies only in managing silver prices, not in addressing the trade deficit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, silver exportation does not cause a major panic in Shanghai's financial market. The public's excessive concern that Shanghai's finances will gradually dry up is, at least, not currently the case. Looking at the Shanghai financial market's interbank loan rates in recent months, the average rate in June was 6%, and in July it was also 6%. From August 1st to 16th, it was 7%, and from the 17th to the 19th, it was 8%, showing a gradual upward trend. From the 20th to the 26th, a fluctuating trend can be observed:</p>
<p>August 20th: 10% August 24th: 15%</p>
<p>August 21st: 11% August 25th: 10%</p>
<p>August 22nd: 13% August 26th: 7%</p>
<p>August 23rd: 13%</p>
<p>Although an interbank loan rate of 10% is the highest seen this year, the 15% on August 24th was the highest peak this year. But compared to normal years, the market does not consider this a serious situation. The rise starting on the 21st had a special cause: the collapse of the Wu Hua Industrial Bank, which caused aftershocks of panic. As for the sudden rise on the 24th, it was purely due to the newspapers printing the silver export issue in large headlines, which stirred up public sentiment. Therefore, from the 25th onwards, the rates gradually declined. The fact that the market has not been severely affected during this period of reduced reserves is due to the circulation of paper currency.</p>
<p>Balancing international trade payments can certainly reduce silver outflow, but the current focus should be on how to raise domestic silver prices and stop speculation. Otherwise, even with a trade surplus, silver outflow may still not be stopped. Although large-scale silver outflow may not have an immediate impact on Shanghai's finances, speculation will eventually affect silver reserves. According to the effect of exchange rates, if there is a difference in exchange rates between two locations, buying and selling will equalize the prices. However, as long as the global currency war continues, exchange rate differences will never be balanced. Therefore, finding a way to raise domestic silver prices becomes the central issue.</p>

<p>丨Decline of One to Two Yuan and Seventy-Eight Jiao丨</p>
<p>Last week, from August 27th to September 1st, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced turbulent market prices due to the settlement period and the transition between August and October futures contracts. The environmental situation was extremely unfavorable for the bulls. There was no way to stop the outflow of cash, and the future of foreign interbank lending showed a gradual upward trend. Therefore, there were rumors that banks were not arbitraging and that the Ministry of Finance also wanted to release spot goods. Furthermore, rumors of Liu Xiang's resignation were rampant, and it was a time of utter chaos. The Northern Gang consistently sold aggressively, and most retail investors were also scared out. The market makers also took advantage of people's fear and shorted heavily. Observing their bidding prices in each round, they sincerely suppressed the prices, not hesitating to use other people's resources to benefit themselves. Throwing stones down a well was a hidden reef in the market. Based on the current situation, these market makers are extremely weak in morale, and the over-crowding of shorts may lead to a rebound. The trend was worst on Monday, with tightened silver supply and Liu Xiang's resignation, selling pressure surged, and the price fell sharply by about two yuan. There was a sudden rebound on Tuesday, as it was the last day before settlement, due to swap relations, the price suddenly returned to about a few jiao to one yuan. One fall and one rise already offset each other. Wednesday was a market holiday due to the August futures settlement. On Thursday, the October futures were re-auctioned. Due to the continued outflow of cash and Shi Yousan (name) and others plotting against Tianjin, the market price fell sharply again by about two yuan. People were extremely frightened, and morale was even weaker. The market stabilized slightly on Friday, but still continued to decline by about half a yuan. On Saturday, the foreign interbank lending rate reached 15%, and the market price fell two rounds in a row, down another two yuan. The closing session was to cover shorts, and the price slightly rebounded by a few jiao to one yuan. As a result of the weekly market price, the decline was one yuan and several jiao to two yuan and seventy-eight jiao. The total transaction volume was 14,263,200 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

The remaining new japonica and new pointed rice are still difficult to sell, and the supply exceeds demand, so the price is slightly lower by about one jiao.

<p>Due to the high price and extreme shortage of incoming goods, the manufacturers of American tinplate, in view of the soaring price of German tinplate, have also started purchasing, but the bottom goods are extremely thin, causing a shortage panic. Influenced by the environment, the standard has also been raised. Currently, 90-pound single-coated tinplate is estimated at 16.5 yuan, and double-coated is estimated at 32.75 yuan. 100-pound single-coated is estimated at 17.5 yuan, and double-coated is sold at 35 yuan. The market opened yesterday with more than 700 boxes, but spot single-coated is even scarcer, so the market is becoming more and more rigid. It is heard that can factories and printing factories are worried that the supply of spot goods will be cut off next year, so they are offering futures to foreign firms and colleagues. It is found that Huacheng, Science, Jiami and other factories have disposed of more than 3,000 boxes of futures, but the market price is 5 jiao to 1 yuan less than the spot price.</p>

<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>The Treatise on Cold Damage, Debating Pulse Diagnosis, says: [The pulse is floating and tight. Floating indicates wind. Tight indicates cold. Wind injures the Wei (defensive qi). Cold injures the Rong (nutritive qi). When both Rong and Wei are injured, the bones and joints become painful and restless. One should induce sweating.] This is the foundation upon which the Taiyang chapter is based. Zhu Fengyi said: [Guizhi Decoction is mainly for injuring the Wei. Mahuang Decoction is mainly for injuring the Rong. Major Green Dragon Decoction is for injuring both Rong and Wei.] This is the beginning of the three fundamental principles of the Taiyang chapter. Later, Xu Xue Shi followed this. Until Fang Zhonghang's Annotations on the Treatise on Cold Damage, the Taiyang chapter was divided into three parts: upper, middle, and lower. Wind injuring the Wei was designated as the upper part, cold injuring the Rong as the middle part, and wind and cold injuring both Rong and Wei as the lower part. Yu Jiayan adopted this theory and wrote the Shang Lun chapter. Wei Litong followed this and wrote The Original Meaning of the Treatise on Cold Damage. Those who discuss the Treatise on Cold Damage later mostly treat the three fundamental principles of wind injuring the Wei, cold injuring the Rong, and wind and cold injuring both Rong and Wei as immutable. To understand the fallacy of this, one must begin by understanding the Rong and Wei themselves.</p>
<p>The Spiritual Pivot, Chapter on the Meeting of Nutritive and Defensive Qi, says: [The clear is the nutritive (qi), the turbid is the defensive (qi). The nutritive (qi) is within the vessels, the defensive (qi) is outside the vessels.] It also says: [The nutritive (qi) originates from the middle Jiao (burner), the defensive (qi) originates from the lower Jiao (burner).] It also says: [The middle Jiao also comes from the stomach and goes to the upper Jiao. It separates the dregs, steams the fluids, and transforms them into their essence. It ascends to the lung vessels, where it transforms into blood to nourish the body. Nothing is more important than this. Therefore, it is only able to travel through the meridians and is called the nutritive qi.] From this perspective, the nutritive (qi) is blood. Blood congeals when it encounters cold, as is the case with frostbite. Therefore, the theory of cold injuring the nutritive (qi) seems to be well-founded. However, frostbite is completely different from the Taiyang chapter of cold damage. If one wants to force an analogy, frostbite is not without symptoms of tight pulse and aversion to cold. However, additional symptoms such as drowsiness and staggering gait are not found in Taiyang cold damage. Furthermore, it can only occur when the air temperature drops below negative ten degrees Celsius, and it is extremely rare in the south. How can it be as Zhongjing (Zhang Zhongjing) said, that two-thirds of the clan die from this disease? It must be as Qin Huangzhu said, that Zhongjing was a native of Nanyang, Hebei, and cold damage is a disease of the northern winter months before it can be forced. However, Shi Busi has already refuted Qin's theory. Therefore, frostbite and Taiyang cold damage are as unrelated as a horse and a cow. It is clear that Taiyang cold damage is not cold injuring the Rong.</p>
<p>As for the Wei, we still do not know what it is. Judging from the Internal Classic's theory that the turbid is the Wei, then it is a useless waste product in the body. Judging from the theory that the Wei originates from the lower Jiao, it is the urine of the bladder. The Spiritual Pivot, Chapter on the Meeting of Nutritive and Defensive Qi, says: [The lower Jiao separates the large and small intestines, pours into the bladder, and seeps into it.] This is my evidence that the Wei is urine. Urine is a waste product in the body, which is consistent with the theory that the turbid is the Wei. Furthermore, judging from the theory that the Wei travels outside the vessels, the network of pathways in the human body that is similar to blood vessels is the nervous system and the lymphatic vessels. However, the nervous system cannot be said to be turbid, and injury to the nervous system will inevitably cause pain and paralysis, which is not present in Taiyang cold damage. Therefore, it can be determined that the Wei is not the nervous system. Then the Wei is the lymphatic system. What is lymph? In a broad sense, it is the fluid outside the blood vessels. All fluids between tissue cells that are not surrounded by blood vessels and do not travel within the meridians can be called lymph. The fluid in the cerebrospinal canal and the fluid in the pericardium are also included. However, these two cannot be said to be turbid, and injury to these two will inevitably cause symptoms of meningitis and pericarditis. The changes in these fluids are actually affected by meningitis and pericarditis, placing them in a passive position and unable to cause disease on their own. Therefore, the so-called Wei is not lymph in the broad sense. Then the Wei is the lymph in the narrow sense, which is the lymph fluid in the tissue cells and lymphatic vessels.</p>
<p>Lymph is filled in the gaps between tissue cells and serves as a medium for metabolism between blood and tissue cells. Its origin is still from the blood vessels. Liquid leaks from the capillary vessels and enters between the tissue cells, which is lymph. Therefore, the composition of lymph is roughly the same as that of plasma, and it is not particularly different from blood. Lymph from the tissue cells comes from the blood and is then reabsorbed by the blood vessels. The remaining sediment that is not absorbed flows into the small lymphatic vessels distributed between the tissue cells. The small lymphatic vessels flow into the large lymphatic vessels, and the large lymphatic vessels flow into the large venous vessels, where they mix with the blood again. Lymph comes from the blood vessels, carrying nutrients. When it returns to the blood vessels and flows into the small lymphatic vessels in other directions, it carries waste products away, which is what is meant by turbid. However, as a result, a part of it still returns to the blood vessels, and although a part of it passes through the lymphatic vessels, it eventually enters the blood vessels. Therefore, an injury to this is an injury to the nutritive blood. How can it be separated from the injury to the nutritive blood and exist independently?</p>
<h3 id="e221">Murder by Incompetent Doctors <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Only incompetent doctors commit murder,</p>
<p>Good doctors uphold morality and cherish benevolence.</p>
<p>May the court not heed false accusations,</p>
<p>So that medical disputes may cease.</p>
<p>The world declines, and people's hearts become more treacherous. Medical disputes are increasing daily, and appearing in court has become commonplace. However, upon closer examination, regardless of the facts, patients accuse doctors of "murder by incompetent doctors." To call a doctor incompetent implies that their knowledge and character are insufficient for their profession, and thus, their killing is understandable. However, it is unreasonable to suspect a doctor who is not incompetent, whose knowledge is recognized by schools, whose qualifications are recognized by the state, and whose credibility is recognized by society, of deliberately committing murder. Therefore, licensed doctors would never commit murder, while incompetent doctors inevitably would. Are all those currently accused by patients truly incompetent doctors? As seen in the conclusion of many cases, the medical professionals often win, indicating that the accused are not incompetent doctors but are innocent victims. Therefore, when the court receives such cases, it should first investigate thoroughly. If the accused is a licensed doctor, the case should be dismissed because licensed doctors cannot be legitimately accused.</p>
<p>Let me explain the reasons why licensed doctors cannot be accused:</p>
<p>(1) Licensed doctors, having graduated from formal medical schools and received advanced education, possess considerable character and knowledge and would never engage in exaggeration or deception. They do not rely on advertisements to attract patients; patients come naturally. Confucius said: "The superior man learns to attain his Dao." Licensed doctors are the same, learning to attract patients; they come without being sought. If the outcome is unsatisfactory, the responsibility should not fall solely on the doctor. However, it is different for quack doctors, who exaggerate in their advertisements and offer low consultation fees. Patients come because they are misled by the advertisements and are not acting on their own volition. Therefore, if there are errors, quack doctors should bear legal responsibility, and the court should impose severe penalties.</p>
<p>(2) Licensed doctors possess ample knowledge and rich experience, and patients should absolutely obey them. Their diagnoses and treatments are beyond the understanding of patients. Medical conditions are constantly changing, and doctors cannot cure all diseases. It is unfounded for patients with no medical knowledge to claim that the doctor's diagnosis is inaccurate or the treatment is wrong. Even if other doctors are consulted, their conjectures after the fact cannot be as accurate as the observations of the original treating physician. Therefore, for patients to question the appropriateness of a doctor's diagnosis and treatment as grounds for litigation is like a summer insect talking about ice, pretending to know what they do not. As for quack doctors, who lack knowledge, their diagnoses and treatments are often erroneous. Occasional cures are due to luck, and failures are undoubtedly due to mistakes. Patients should certainly accuse and sue them, unlike licensed doctors.</p>
<p>(3) Licensed doctors have earned their reputations over time. They approach diagnoses with extreme caution and never act negligently. Accusing doctors of intentional murder is absurd. Why would a doctor hate a patient enough to intentionally kill them? Why would a doctor hate their own hard-earned reputation enough to deliberately destroy it? This shows the absurdity of the accusation of intentional murder. Doctors treat diseases without intentional fault. Even if something unfortunate happens, it is unintentional, a matter of academic debate, not a legal one. Therefore, licensed doctors should not bear criminal responsibility. However, quack doctors, driven by profit, disregard morality and shame, performing abortions at will. Patients should not allow them to escape justice.</p>
<p>(4) Life is priceless. Licensed doctors save thousands of lives, and their contributions are evident to the world. Even if there are one or two unintentional errors, the merits outweigh the demerits. Public opinion should recognize this. Demands for civil compensation often use the deceased's financial value as the basis (e.g., demanding compensation of 10,000 yuan because the deceased could earn 1,000 yuan per year for ten more years). Then, shouldn't doctors also have the same demands for patients they have cured? Patients often begrudge paying doctors' fees but demand exorbitant sums upon death as leverage. Is this fair? Therefore, doctors should not be liable for civil damages. However, if such incidents occur with quack doctors who aim to make money, they should be fined heavily to curb their deceitful intentions and deter others.</p>
<p>(5) Doctors have the right to maintain the patient's privacy. They treat patients as their own responsibility. Except for formal consultations, no third parties should be involved. This is essential for responsible treatment, as seen in civilized and advanced countries. However, the situation is different in our country. Patients may consult different doctors, using both modern and traditional medicine, mixing Chinese and Western treatments. These situations are difficult to describe in detail. When the condition changes, they want the modern doctor to bear full responsibility. How can that responsibility be assigned? Therefore, modern doctors in China today cannot bear any legal responsibility. Yet, they are constantly being accused, which is unfair.</p>
<p>In summary, medical disputes have many causes, and the court's readiness to accept cases encourages patients to litigate. The key is for the court to investigate whether the accused is a licensed doctor before accepting the case. If the accused is a licensed doctor, the lawsuit should be rejected. This will eliminate false accusations, resolve disputes, and protect the medical profession. This is what I hope for!</p>
<h3 id="e222">Protecting Children's Teeth (Part 2) <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>Protect the First Permanent Molars</p>
<p>From the chart above of the eruption times of permanent teeth, we can see that the first molars erupt between the ages of five and seven. These teeth are the cornerstones of the dental arch. If these teeth are lost, the adjacent teeth are prone to tipping and becoming maloccluded. In adulthood, the chin recedes, the face loses its symmetry, and the teeth are misaligned and prone to decay. Parents often mistakenly think that these teeth are temporary baby teeth and allow them to decay, affecting all future teeth, which is a pity. Therefore, parents should always pay attention to the emergence of these teeth and protect them. Once these teeth erupt, other permanent teeth will erupt in succession.</p>
<p>How to Prevent Tooth Decay</p>
<p>The prevention of tooth decay can be summarized into the following four aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Develop Good Habits: Mothers should clean their infant's mouth with disinfectant solution daily before the teeth erupt. When the teeth first erupt, they should wipe off any debris with a clean, damp cloth. At four or five years old, children should be given a small toothbrush with soft, fine bristles and taught how to brush their teeth. This trains children to develop good oral hygiene habits. Once this habit is formed, they will maintain it throughout their lives, and their teeth will not easily decay. Therefore, developing good habits is the most effective way to prevent dental problems.</p>
<p>(2) Reasonable Brushing Method: First, soak the toothbrush in warm water, then apply toothpaste or tooth powder. When brushing, brush both the inside and outside surfaces, especially the inside. The brushing motion should be vertical or circular, so the debris in the gaps between teeth can be swept away. Many people brush horizontally or only brush the outside or front. This makes it difficult to remove debris and can cause dental problems.</p>
<p>Brush your teeth once every morning and after each meal. At a minimum, brush twice a day, once in the morning and once after dinner. Children like to eat sweets, but sugar easily turns into acid and damages tooth enamel. It is best to reduce snacking or brush immediately after eating to prevent food residue from harming the teeth.</p>
<p>(3) Choose Beneficial Foods: Food is essential for healthy teeth. Strong teeth are created by nutritious food. Mothers should choose foods rich in calcium during pregnancy, such as milk, eggs, vegetables, oranges, and brown rice (avoid over-processed white rice), to strengthen their children's teeth. During the growth period, children should eat foods rich in vitamins, such as egg yolks, milk, cod liver oil, oranges, and vegetables, as these are very beneficial to their teeth.</p>
<p>(4) Regular Dental Checkups: Children have baby teeth changing around the age of seven. During these seven years, it is best to have a dental checkup every six months. Treat any problems and remove plaque to prevent early loss of baby teeth. If a baby tooth feels loose, it should be removed immediately. Otherwise, permanent teeth may erupt from the front or back, causing misalignment. Even after all the permanent teeth come in, regular dental checkups and cleaning are still important.</p>
<p>Routine dental checkups and treatment are the most economical approach. For example, if person A gets regular dental checkups every year, and person B neglects their teeth, person A will have clean teeth and good oral health, while person B will suffer from dental problems. Because teeth decay, become infected, and require extraction, they may need dentures. The pain, money, and time spent are several times more than person A. Therefore, regular dental checkups are essential for preventing dental problems.</p>
<p>The Impact of Teeth on Physical Health</p>
<p>Everyone knows that food must be chewed thoroughly for easy digestion. If teeth are lost and proper chewing is impossible, the body will not be able to fully absorb and assimilate the food for nourishment. Eating twice as much food only yields half the benefits. Without proper digestion, how can one expect to be healthy?</p>
<p>Diseased teeth or decayed teeth with dead pulp can cause infectious foci, which reduce the body's resistance and lead to various diseases, such as sinusitis, pneumonia, arthritis, pleurisy, meningitis, pericarditis, periostitis, appendicitis, lung disease, deafness, and epilepsy. Many of these diseases are caused by pus from tooth decay flowing into the body through the blood vessels or esophagus. The mouth is the passageway for food. No matter how clean the food is, it cannot remain hygienic if it passes through a mouth full of decay, bacteria, and grime. Therefore, teeth are crucial to health.</p>
<p>The Contribution of Preventive Dentistry</p>
<p>The greatest contribution of dentistry to society is not in surgical dentistry or restorative dentistry, but in preventive dentistry. Preventive dentistry is the study of how to prevent dental diseases in humans. This is the most advanced and valuable field in dentistry. Scholars in various countries are focusing on this area. With the advancement of this field, humans will have healthy teeth, and the other two branches can be eliminated. American dentist Dr. Fones was a strong and long-time proponent of preventive dentistry. His patient records show that many of his former child patients have grown into young adults with beautiful smiles and healthy teeth, free of cavities and fillings, living healthy and happy lives.</p>
<p>Therefore, preventive dentistry does benefit society in reality. Dental professionals in various countries have long recognized the importance of children's oral hygiene, and parents are increasingly aware of it. Therefore, they can cooperate with dentists, seek advice regularly, and implement preventive measures, so their children can benefit for a lifetime. In our country, parents rarely take their children to the dentist unless they have a toothache. The reasons for this include: (1) lack of understanding of the importance of prevention; (2) saving on dental fees; (3) fear of children crying, which causes more trouble. (In fact, parents can give positive suggestions, so children know the dentist will not cause them pain, but will make their teeth beautiful and eliminate toothaches. Then, children will be happy to comply.) I dare to sincerely tell my fellow citizens that the spiritual, time, and monetary losses that children suffer from unhealthy teeth will be hundreds of times more than the current dental fees. Fellow citizens, rather than spending a lot of effort to treat adults, why not spend less effort to raise healthy children?</p>
<h3 id="e223">A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (19) <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>The onset of pulmonary tuberculosis is mostly insidious; its course is also very chronic, lasting not only three or five years, but also twenty or thirty years. Besides this, it can also begin acutely, but this is relatively rare. In this case, the temperature will suddenly increase at the beginning, accompanied by subjective symptoms such as headache and limb pain; this situation is very similar to the flu. If we conduct a thorough examination, there is nothing to find in the auscultation and percussion, but tuberculosis bacteria can be found in the morning sputum, and X-rays can reveal the infiltration.</p>
<p>Among the acute onsets of this disease, the most prominent is caseous pneumonia! It is suddenly triggered by a high fever and a state of general lethargy, and most cases are incurable; this appearance is almost the same as acute infectious diseases. In addition, there is a type where the lesion is not caseous pneumonia, but its spread is very rapid, and the appearance is similar; this is the ordinary [galloping consumption]. The course of these two types is completely different from the previous chronic type; their prognosis is very poor, and even general physicians are afraid of them.</p>
<p>The onset of pulmonary tuberculosis has already been discussed above. Regarding its general important symptoms, such as night sweats, cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, temperature, etc., I will now describe them one by one below:</p>
<p>(1) Night sweats: Most common tuberculosis patients experience increased temperature at night, and excessive sweating occurs when their temperature drops in the middle of the night or early morning. This symptom can disrupt the patient's sleep and consume their physical strength. In addition, it can also occur in the early stages of the disease; experienced physicians will not easily overlook it. However, we must know that nervous causes such as insomnia, mental disturbance, and frequent dreams due to overstimulation can also cause it. These should not be confused.</p>
<p>(2) Weight Loss: This is a warning to the patient. If ordinary people gradually lose weight for no reason, although it cannot be said to be definitely pulmonary tuberculosis, at least it can be said that a thorough lung examination is inevitable. The reason for this is probably due to poor appetite and weight loss; the rise in material exchange function is inevitably related. This is not to mention for patients who usually have a fever, but there are also more than 30% of such cases without a temperature increase phenomenon. The occurrence of this symptom does not mean that the disease has worsened. In fact, what the facts tell us is sometimes the opposite: in people with good nutritional status, their lung damage is easily enlarged; and the disease suffered by the weak is mostly more likely to develop induration, and the prognosis is better.</p>
<p>(3) Anemia: Ordinary people suffering from this disease always have a pale color: if the patient is a woman, it is easy to confuse it with chlorosis. But the fact is not always the case. It is true that the number of red blood cells and hemoglobin components in patients with this disease can sometimes be reduced, just like chlorosis; but most of it is so when the disease is progressing, and there is no such significant change usually. The same is true for the increase in the number of blood cells and lymphatic leukocytes. The differentiation of these two aspects, of course, requires a precise blood test before it can be revealed. The details of the matter can only be described in another chapter on clinical examination methods!</p>
<p>(4) Cough: Cough is one of the important symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, and the sentence "prolonged cough is easy to become consumption" has almost become a common saying. When we diagnose diseases, many patients who come to see us because of a cough end up developing tuberculous lesions; even the patients themselves sometimes feel that they have been coughing for too long and are afraid of tuberculous causes. Among them, there are also many people who have not sought medical attention. From this situation, we can know that the general public attaches great importance to this symptom. At the beginning of this disease, many people do not cough, and even if they do, most of it is related to external attacks, such as dust, coal ash, and prolonged loud talking, which are generally unrelated to tuberculosis itself. When it develops into a dry cough, even a spasmodic cough, it is mostly caused by dry pleurisy or laryngitis. Coughing in pulmonary tuberculosis itself is mostly due to sputum remaining in the trachea; we know that there is a kind of cilia in the trachea, which is dedicated to sputum discharge. In this case, the patient certainly has to cough. In this case, many patients have no interruption, but some people have severe coughs every morning and evening. In addition, one thing should also be mentioned, that is: sometimes there is no cough at all when the disease progresses. Of course, this is very rare. The author remembers that he once diagnosed a patient who had a lot of tuberculosis bacteria in his sputum, which was undoubtedly open pulmonary tuberculosis; in the X-ray examination, except for a part of the lower lobe, almost the entire lung was initially infiltrated. This situation, of course, is very serious, but he has no cough symptoms at all. Based on this point, readers can imagine how complicated and atypical the symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis are.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Random Notes on Vaccination (Continued) <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Zang Hebai</p>
<p>Also, the current practitioners who advertise using the "old method of cowpox vaccination" do not preserve the national essence: they do not use human lymph, but use the cowpox vaccine used by us. The only difference is that they vaccinate more times on both arms. You should know that the immunity obtained after vaccination can be achieved with one or ten inoculations. There is no difference in their degree. Although there is something morally questionable about these old-fashioned smallpox practitioners using cowpox vaccine, I especially welcome it in fact. Why? Because cowpox vaccine is disinfected. If it has not passed its effective time, it can be used boldly without harm. Human lymph is difficult to ask about. However, I feel that in addition to using cowpox vaccine, why not use general disinfection methods, which would be even better?</p>
<p>During vaccination, there are also two things that are often encountered in society: "eating triggering foods" and "abstaining from certain foods." Old-fashioned smallpox practitioners also think these are very important. In fact, the production and disappearance of immunity has absolutely nothing to do with dietary intake. If it does, there is no need to promote flower-like immunity by eating some triggering foods! Do people who abstain from certain foods very strictly never lose their smallpox immunity? And the facts tell us that after vaccination, eating whatever you want, not eating triggering foods beforehand, and not abstaining from certain foods afterward, does not mean that the immunity in the body has disappeared. There is no difference between the first and second vaccinations.</p>
<p>Red light has been found to be beneficial to natural smallpox (i.e., human smallpox rash) based on experience, but it has no effect on artificial smallpox (i.e., the vaccinated smallpox)! And the general public in society puts many red cloths around the heads of vaccinated children, calling it "wearing red," and also wears red shirts and pants, which is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Most of us know that the only way to prevent smallpox is by vaccination. I don't know what use it is to paste strips of red paper a few inches wide and three or four inches long with the words "smallpox has passed" on the doors of every house in an area where smallpox is prevalent, and to attach similar red cloth strips to children. Even if we say that red light is the only weapon to kill smallpox pathogens (which have not yet been discovered), let's close our eyes and think: Can such a large house and such a large child be isolated from the elusive smallpox pathogens with such a large paper strip or cloth strip? Is the operation so simple? Can the desired goal be achieved?</p>
<p>When vaccinating, the general public welcomes vaccination practitioners to vaccinate their children until they bleed, which is incorrect! Because when we vaccinate, we only need to cut through the thinnest layer of epidermis and let the applied vaccine be absorbed through the opening. The vaccine can enter through the opening. At that time, the opening must be able to have an absorptive effect. Scientifically speaking, that place must have a negative pressure. If that place is bleeding, it is not an absorptive effect, but a breathing effect, which is a positive pressure. Doesn't this go against the original intention of applying the vaccine?</p>
<p>The four seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter have nothing to do with vaccination. However, because the weather is hot in summer, the effectiveness of the vaccine is easily lost; the weather is cold in winter, and people who are vaccinated are prone to catch a cold. The climate in spring and autumn is neither cold nor warm, and there are no such disadvantages, so it is suitable. It is also wrong for society to only believe in vaccinating in spring and not in autumn!</p>
<p>Babies can be vaccinated as early as eighty days after birth. Also, when smallpox is very prevalent, they should be vaccinated as early as seven days after they are born. It is even more unreasonable for the general public to say that babies' internal organs are not fully developed and that they can only be vaccinated after one or two years old! Because babies' internal organs are fully equipped at birth, and what is the relationship between the production of smallpox immunity and whether the five internal organs are complete?</p>

<p>(13) Peritonsillar Inflammation and Peritonsillar Abscess</p>
<p>This disease occurs when suffering from lacunar tonsillitis. If, after the body temperature drops and local pain subsides, sudden chills and shivering occur, and the fever rises again, the patient feels particularly severe pain in the tonsillar region on the affected side (mostly limited to one side; it rarely occurs on both sides). The pain can often radiate to the ear. Swallowing becomes very difficult. During meals, liquids often flow backward and out through the nasal cavity. If the pain becomes more intense, swallowing becomes completely impossible. Even swallowing a few drops of water is considered a painful event by the patient. The patient's mental state is very sensitive and easily angered. Sleep at night is also restless, and speech is inconvenient. When the doctor examines the throat, the patient is often unwilling to open their mouth due to the difficulty of opening it and the pain. If they reluctantly endure the pain and open their mouth, or if an oral retractor is used, the soft palate on the affected side is seen to be highly red and swollen, sometimes involving the soft palate. The palatine tonsil is also clearly congested. If a probe is used to touch the swollen area, it feels hard and resistant, and the patient feels tenderness. This is called peritonsillitis. If these symptoms persist for one or two days, the swollen area may soften and become fluctuating. This is due to the formation of pus. At this time, it is called peritonsillar abscess. The patient suffers the most at this time, full of self-pity and resentment, unable to sit or lie still. The head and neck are often tilted. The area near the abscess often shows inflammatory swelling. The uvula and the soft palate on the healthy side are also often swollen.</p>
<p>Speaking of the treatment methods for this disease, it is best to implement appropriate treatment when suffering from lacunar tonsillitis to prevent the occurrence of peritonsillar inflammation early on. Once peritonsillar inflammation has occurred, drug application, gargling, and covering methods should be continued repeatedly. If the pain is unbearable and there are already fluctuations, then surgery must be performed to incise and drain the pus. The pain can then stop on its own, and the patient will immediately feel relief. After two or three days, they can fully recover and regain their health.</p>

<p>Chapter 1: A Ghost Carries a Carriage of Distant Guests from Guanzhong, A Poor Family Crosses the Ferry, Mourning a Qin Man</p>
<p>He took the duster and swatted it all over his body, stirring up a cloud of smoke and dust, a layer of gray in the white light. At this time, a man in a Western suit was standing under the eaves of the house, just looking at them. Seeing the tea boy carrying a basin of water to this room, he smiled and said, "Your business is really good, this row of houses in the back is full again today." Li Shilian heard his accent, which was also Southern, clearly a guest as well. He felt like he was in a foreign land, and the principle of [bowing to every Buddha encountered] was most applicable. As an official, as long as you know more friends, there's always a way. So he took this opportunity and interjected, "The hotel business is so good in Xi'an." As he spoke, he smiled and nodded to the man. The man naturally couldn't accept it so casually, so he nodded back. Li Shilian then took another step forward, bowing and smiling, "This gentleman also has a Southern accent, what is your honorable surname?" Seeing him so polite, the man couldn't refuse too much, so he smiled and said he was from Jiangsu, named Cheng Zhiqian, and had come here to investigate education, as he was a teacher at a middle school. Li Shilian heard that he was here to investigate education, and whether or not he connected with this kind of person didn't matter much to him. So the conversation ended there. He went back into his room to pack his luggage and no longer tried to make friends with Cheng Zhiqian. By this time, it was already after four o'clock in the afternoon. He washed his face and asked the hotel for something to eat, and the sky was already getting dark. But the first thing that made him unhappy was that the tea boy brought in a tall kerosene lamp in the dim light. When the lamp was placed on the table, the white walls of the room seemed to take on a yellowish hue. Li Shilian was thirty-six years old this year, and since he was twenty, he had never lived with an oil lamp. Now, suddenly seeing it, he couldn't say exactly what kind of boredom he felt in his heart. He was feeling very bored. (10)</p>
<h3 id="e227">Nameless Heroes <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Li Kui</p>
<p>These anti-Japanese heroes are not as famous as Ma Zhanshan and Cai Tingkai; that's why they are called nameless heroes.</p>
<p>But their bravery, their spirit of sacrifice, is truly more worthy of admiration than those famous heroes.</p>
<p>I will now tell this story: It was after the September 18th Incident, when Japan had already occupied Liaoning, Jilin, and part of Heilongjiang, but had not yet occupied Harbin.</p>
<p>When the Japanese attacked Harbin, Ding Chao's troops resisted; so there was a very fierce battle in Majiagou.</p>
<p>After fighting for a day and a night, Ding Chao's troops were finally defeated! Because Japan had planes dropping bombs in the sky, and tanks charging forward on the ground! Their military equipment was very pitiful, without anti-aircraft guns or trenches; so they were only retreating step by step.</p>
<p>However, some soldiers had been chased and couldn't run away, and were about to die under machine-gun fire! Seeing that running was also death, they immediately turned around and fought the enemy to the death! Some lay horizontally in front of the tanks to stop them from advancing; some used their bayonets to thrust into the gun holes.</p>
<p>At this time, half of them were killed again, but they still desperately fought the enemy hand-to-hand! Finally, they killed the enemies inside the tanks and captured these tanks.</p>
<p>These anti-Japanese heroes are truly admirable and can be remembered in the history of the anti-Japanese war; but they are nameless heroes!</p>
<p>I think the reason they are nameless is because their achievements are built on their own blood, not on the skulls of others.</p>

<h3 id="e229">New Incantation for Begging for Rain <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Ou</p>
<p>Chinese farmers who rely on the heavens for their livelihoods have already gazed with longing eyes in this year of drought and heat. The gods of the Five Sacred Mountains and Four Great Rivers, famous mountains and great rivers, have completely lost their efficacy. News of reporting famine, fleeing famine, begging for relief, and robbing rice fills the pages of newspapers. Artificial rainmaking using scientific methods is still a distant water that cannot quench the immediate thirst. In a situation where nothing can be done, performing old tricks such as setting up altars, building altars, banning slaughter, and praying for rain is only a case of calling upon the heavens without response and summoning the earth without result, a consolation that is better than nothing.</p>
<p>In the Song Dynasty, there was a so-called lizard rain-making method, where live lizards were caught and placed in urns, and twenty-eight boy children, with their faces, hands, and feet painted blue, holding willow branches and sprinkling water, circled around chanting incantations. Although the ritual was ridiculous, the incantations were quite authentic. The incantation said:</p>
<p>[Lizard, lizard! Raise clouds and spit mist, make rain torrential, and let you return to the clouds.]</p>

<p>— Originally Written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>If someone's ancestral graves happen to be near the railway, then these days, because they know that the Empress Dowager will be passing by here soon, they definitely won't dare to come to sweep the tombs. But when we look out from the car windows, we can still see them very clearly: they all turn their backs and dare not look us directly in the eye, because the local officials have already widely warned them. However, I can say with certainty: they did not comply with this secret order! Originally, curiosity is something that everyone must have. The common people only hear people talk about the Emperor and the Empress Dowager all year round, but they have never seen what kind of gods or people the Emperor or the Empress Dowager actually are. It is rare to encounter our special train, carrying the Empress Dowager and the Emperor, passing in front of them, so of course they would not want to miss this opportunity again. So they borrowed the posture of kneeling and worshiping the ancestral graves, lowered their heads, widened their eyes, and tried their best to peek from under their arms: however, at most they can only see this yellow train and many shadows of people squirming on the train. The true appearance of the Empress Dowager and the Emperor is still invisible.</p>
<p>Regarding the custom of sweeping tombs during Qingming, I also had a very memorable discussion with the Empress Dowager, and we both had the same feelings. If I were to record it, it would be another very long article.</p>
<p>Along the road we passed, almost all were tombs, so on this day, the people sweeping the tombs were indeed coming and going in an endless stream. The Empress Dowager gazed at them very attentively from the car window; at the same time, her face showed a layer of thoughtful, deep gray, and her eyebrows were also knitted together. Whenever she was pondering something, her attitude was always very melancholy and depressed. At this time, no matter what interesting thing happened, she would never laugh. (119)</p>
<p>Under our lower-class masses' philosophy of [Pantheism], the deities who bring rain and the techniques for seeking rain are fundamentally inexhaustible. The following chapters, imitating the ancients in a clumsy way, present rain-seeking incantations, although carrying some impertinent tone of questioning, can also represent the emotions of the lower people's resentment and anxiety:</p>
<p>Not a single cloud forms, not a drop of rain falls, the sun shines brightly all morning, a clear sky in broad daylight. (Chapter 1)</p>
<p>Thunder Rain Thunder Ancestor! Where have you retreated to? Could it be that you are being passive, the Electric Mother has lost her love. (Chapter 2)</p>
<p>In the past, Shang Tang cut his nails and hair, prayed for rain in Sanglin, and pretended to commit suicide, which also moved the heavens, and the rain poured down: Moreover, today's morning people are not lacking in hanging themselves!</p>
<p>The Blue-clad Daoists and the priests of the Yu Gate dance together, singing the Cloud Han, saying to bring rain. Now on the sea, dancing halls are everywhere, in jazz songs, swaying morning and night, the art of dancing is so skillful, why doesn't it rain? Cloud or rain, Om Mani Padme Hum! (Chapter 4)</p>

<p>In the new autumn weather, the autumn insects in the fields chirp noisily. Children pick bricks and pull grass, searching hard, and at night they take flashlights or light red candles. If they are in deep holes, they pour cold water in to make them unable to hide and jump out. The children are quick-eyed and quick-handed, using small lead wire covers to cage them and catch them into tile pots.</p>
<p>When they are happy, they make an appointment with a friend, and each takes out a tile pot, puts the two crickets in a pot, baring their teeth and waving their claws, fighting each other, killing each other. The winner struts around, showing off his heroism, drumming his wings and chirping loudly, making his friend clap his hands and laugh.</p>
<p>Writing this, I remembered an interesting thing. In my hometown, two young men were pursuing the same girl, but the girl's marriage was in between, either one would be fine, because both young men were eagerly asking her who she belonged to. She was so anxious that she didn't know which one to agree to. Fortunately, she had a quick wit and said, "You two bring crickets to compete! See who wins?" At that time, it was already deep autumn weather. B spent five hundred yuan to buy a general who had been on the battlefield, and A also selected a brave hero. They invited witnesses and judges. In a great battle, in the end, she belonged to B. A was so angry that his body trembled, and he even dropped the tile pot hero on the ground.</p>
<p>The sound of insects on an autumn night is very desolate, like the sound of heavy rain in autumn echoing in the empty sky. The Chinese do not unite to resist foreign insults, but kill each other, truly like a pair of autumn insects.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Pleasure Boat <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Nangongsheng</p>
<p>A pleasure boat is a small boat for touring a lake, arranged very elegantly, very different from ordinary cargo ships that carry goods. Because this kind of pleasure boat is mostly in famous places with many waterways in lakes and islets, it is specially used for tourists to play in the scenery of the watery countryside, so the arrangement on the boat does not need to be practical, as long as it is exquisite, elegant, and suits the mood of the tourists.</p>
<p>The scenery and the clear beauty of the mountains and waters in various parts of China are no less than those of Switzerland, the world's park, especially in the watery countryside, which can be called a separate world. Boating in a small boat, one feels that all sorrows are washed away, and the body and mind are unusually relaxed and happy. Pleasure boats have been discovered in the watery countryside of various places due to this need. So, such places as Suzhou and Wuxi, which resemble Venice, the water city of Italy, can be seen everywhere with clear, green, and vast waves. No matter what famous place you go to, such as Xuanmu Mountain, Tianping Mountain, Tiger Hill, Shihu, Huiquan Mountain, Meiyuan, Taihu Lake, etc., the most convenient way is to travel by waterway, and pleasure boats have become the most suitable gift for tourists. In other scenic spots such as West Lake in Hangzhou, Slender West Lake in Yangzhou, and Daming Lake in Jinan, the most wonderful tourist areas are all in the green water and clear waves, and naturally pleasure boats have become a necessary item. Therefore, in these scenic spots, you can see three or five friends floating and sinking in a beautiful pleasure boat, drifting in the middle of the stream, their joy is harmonious, making you feel unparalleled admiration. However, the arrangement and style of pleasure boats in various places are completely different due to the size of the waterways and the different environments.</p>
<p>The pleasure boats in Suzhou must sail in the wide and deep Xujiang River, so they are larger than other places, except for Wuxi. The largest is more than ten zhang long, with an area of more than one zhang wide, divided into three parts: the bow, the stern, and the cabin. The large cabins are divided into three or two rooms, with exquisite and finely carved movable flower windows arranged on all sides. The whole boat is painted with bright and beautiful Guangqi original lacquer, and the couches, chairs, and tables in the cabin are all made of rosewood. There are two long oars on the stern, which are the only tools for sailing. The stove for cooking is also on the stern. There are only two stone steps on the bow to stabilize the center of gravity. The awning on top is also made of wood, and the bamboo pole for punting the boat is placed horizontally on top. The curtains for the cabin doors and windows are all made of very beautiful materials, so the whole boat meets the requirements of beauty and elegance.</p>
<p>The pleasure boats in Wuxi are similar to those in Suzhou, but they are slightly larger. This is because they have to go to the edge of Taihu Lake, so they have to be a little bigger. The interior arrangement is also the same as in Suzhou. The most famous thing on the boats, in both Suzhou and Wuxi, is the exquisite boat dish, which is still popular and praised today.</p>
<p>The pleasure boats in West Lake are different from those in Suzhou and Wuxi. The volume of the boat is small, with a snow-white cloth awning on the cabin, and some are surrounded by bronze railings, which is extraordinarily elegant. Wicker chairs and wicker tables are arranged in the cabin for tourists to sit and rest. There is only one wooden oar for sailing on the stern. On a clear night with a bright moon, sailing in the middle of the stream with two or three friends, this scene is truly better than the celestial beings in the sky. There are no dishes on the boat, but the famous ones are the clear spring and Longjing tea leaves of Hangzhou. The pleasure boats in Slender West Lake in Yangzhou are very similar to those in West Lake, but the boatmen who row the boats are mostly girls of fifteen or sixteen years old. The pleasure boats in these two places are only used for touring the lake and cannot sail in the deep rivers and pools like the pleasure boats in Suzhou and Wuxi, and they cannot be used as a place to rest.</p>
<p>The pleasure boats in Daming Lake are the strangest, without a bow, like a pleasure boat with the bow cut off. The awning of the cabin is made of a wooden frame with canvas. The interior arrangement is only wicker chairs and tables. There are no oars or paddles on the stern. The only thing for sailing is two tree trunks. Compared with the pleasure boats in Suzhou, Wuxi, and West Lake, the arrangement is the simplest. However, the pre-rain tea brewed with the water of Daming Lake can be compared with the water of Hupao and Longjing in West Lake, which is the most memorable thing.</p>
<p>In addition to the above places, there are also various types such as the Qinhuai pleasure boats, Jiangshan boats, and Guangzhou riverboats, but they are not only valued for their pleasure boats. Because all the boatmen on the boats are beautiful young women, there is some mysterious effect, so their fame is extraordinarily great, which is a case of the drunkard's intention not being in the wine.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Stratosphere Exploration <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Su</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers have been publishing news about the Belgian scientist Piccard's stratosphere exploration. It is said that he ascended to 16,000 meters in a hot air balloon and stayed in the air for 15 hours, and the results were very satisfactory. What exactly is the stratosphere? How should it be explored? Readers may not be very clear, so here is a simple explanation:</p>
<p>As we know, the Earth is surrounded by air. Common experience tells us that the higher the altitude, the lower the air temperature. However, after reaching a certain altitude, the temperature no longer decreases even if we ascend further. It is as if the air is divided into two layers, the lower layer is called the troposphere, where the air temperature decreases rapidly with altitude. The upper layer is called the stratosphere, where the air temperature does not vary with altitude. The height of the stratosphere varies depending on the location. At 50 degrees north latitude, it is about seven miles; at the equator, it is about ten miles; and at the North and South Poles, it is only about five miles.</p>
<p>Recently, scientists from various countries have been paying close attention to the exploration of the stratosphere, and they have been trying various methods to explore the special phenomena of the stratosphere. The tools they commonly use rely on hot air balloons. There are two types of balloons, large and small. The large ones are called sounding balloons, and they are equipped with sophisticated meteorological instruments. After ascending to high altitude, people inside can measure the air pressure, temperature, and humidity of the stratosphere. The small ones are called pilot balloons, with a diameter of only about twenty inches. They have a simpler structure and are released by meteorological stations in various countries every day.</p>
<p>The maximum altitude reached by manned balloons (sounding balloons) is about ten miles. The maximum altitude reached by pilot balloons is more than twelve miles. The altitude reached by airplanes is far less, only about seven or eight miles.</p>
<p>What is the thickness of the stratosphere? This question cannot be answered definitively at present. However, according to general speculation, the temperature in the space from at least six miles to more than twenty-two miles above can definitely be constant.</p>
<p>Most of the various chaotic phenomena in the air are caused by uneven temperatures. Because the temperature is the same everywhere in the stratosphere, the air in the stratosphere does not have phenomena such as heating, cooling, expansion, and contraction like the air in the troposphere. Therefore, all phenomena such as clouds, storms, dryness, and humidity can only exist in the troposphere.</p>
<p>Although the reason why the stratosphere exists is still unknown, it has a very significant impact on meteorology. Therefore, scientists from various countries have been conducting stratosphere exploration one after another. It is expected that in the near future, there will be unexpected discoveries.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Regarding "The Headliner" and So On <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Cunren</p>
<p>A piece by Mr. [Shaobo], titled [Reconciliation], was published in the [Torch] section of the [Great Evening News]. It used every trick in the book to sow discord between me and Mr. Lu Xun, and it also took the opportunity to slander and accuse me personally. It seems to have been written in a state of [righteous indignation]. [Spitting blood on people] is still a bit hot, which is quite shocking! (Naturally, only I am shocked; this should be stated). Moreover, it critically attacked my [Return from the Red Zone] in a fragmented and exaggerated manner. It seems that his [righteous indignation] is worthy of admiration and worship by the [young masses]. However, I believe that the reality may be beyond his expectations.</p>
<p>First, I would like to ask, my [Return from the Red Zone] was a series of articles published in the [Social Daily]. What does it have to do with me that the editor put it at the end? At the same time, Mr. Lu Xun's article was placed at the beginning by the editor because it was a special manuscript for the public. What does this have to do with Mr. Lu Xun and me? [The headliner] is a specialty of Beijing opera troupes. My [Return from the Red Zone] is not a novel and does not deserve this honor, and I do not dare to take on the role of the [headliner] actor. I must first respectfully decline. And tell Mr. [Shaobo] that this time [the art of scolding people] is not applied skillfully.</p>
<p>Second, my [Return from the Red Zone] reported the situation of the Red Bandits in an objective manner, especially the feelings at that time in the paragraph describing the desolate streets of Pingfang after the disaster. It was said entirely in a realistic style. Why is this not allowed? Should I distort reality to deceive readers? Mr. [Shaobo] attacked my description and believed that the current Red Zone is a place [going to the masses], and it should be described as a paradise. This does not make clear what his ideology is. Is it that [going to the masses] only means the current Red Zone? That is one thing; secondly, [young people followed the leaders of the intellectual world and made many miserable efforts, and some even sacrificed their precious lives for this]. Is it believed that the current Red Zone is a paradise, so they made efforts and sacrifices? I declare first that my ideological concepts at the time when I went to the Red Zone were not like that. At the same time, I also believe that many young people were not like that. Mr. [Shaobo] is certainly [filled with righteous indignation], but no one sympathizes with you. Moreover, I believe that young people will immediately scold you for conducting counter-propaganda. I also believe that there will be people following you to scold me, but I believe that your ability to incite is still very weak.</p>
<p>Having been unreasonably scolded and slandered for raising the banner of petty-bourgeois revolutionary literature and advocating the theory of revolutionary romanticism is already [commonplace]. Unexpectedly, now I am suffering for others because of the editing methods of the magazine editor. This is unavoidable to make people laugh bitterly. I would like to take this opportunity to hope that the gentlemen of the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia can give me an impartial and fair critique with theory? If anyone gives me an impartial and fair theoretical critique, I will accept it. However, the reason for hoping that the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia will speak is that Mr. Lu Xun told me not to mention [the proletarian masses], and the reason for hoping that there is a theory to criticize me is that I have only seen the left-wing theorist Gu Fei unreasonably scold me in his article, and I have heard that Mr. Lu Xun even ridiculed me a few times, and I have appreciated the boring sketches in the cartoons, and I have heard slanders, accusations, and malicious words.</p>
<p>Originally, I knew that you young gentlemen would definitely come out to [speak out for justice], especially Mr. Lu Xun, who would definitely launch a counter-attack, so I did not need to defend myself. However, I also knew that in people's [speaking out for justice] and launching counter-attacks, I would inevitably be ridiculed and ridiculed in an unreasonable manner, so I spoke for myself.

<p>— Xin Qin</p>
<p>For someone who hadn't enjoyed a proper bath for three years, that afternoon, they got to float on the sea entirely; initially feeling extremely delighted, gradually they felt utterly exhausted. Upon climbing ashore and getting dressed, it was already sunset. With a slight headache and mildly aching feet, stepping into the twilight, I went straight to a nearby friend's house. Coincidentally, I was invited as a guest by the host, and amidst unenthusiastic drinking, my listless mood was unintentionally carried away by the gentle, cool breeze. The mat was laid out in the courtyard, and under the misty twilight, waves of fresh, invigorating sensations permeated my heart and soul, making me involuntarily exclaim inwardly:</p>
<p>[What a tranquil place!...]</p>
<p>When the drinking ended and the guests dispersed, the air was already filled with a deep, thick night atmosphere. We felt as if we had entered another human realm, feeling light and relaxed all over. The three of us walked together past the flowers and trees veiled by lamplight, stepped out of the gate, and disappeared into the night road where the cool breeze frequently blew.</p>
<p>The night wind blew through the leaves, rustling, echoing the sound of our shivering footsteps on the grassy field. We all laughed happily, continuing to exclaim:</p>
