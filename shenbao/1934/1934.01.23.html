<h3 id="c20">荒木辭職愼 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>日本陸軍大臣荒木貞夫。突於本日提出辭呈。其辭職理由。據東電所傳爲病體未痊。不克出席議會。然彼左右日本政局之時代寵兒。軍人少壯派之代表。竟爾於議會正式再開之際。忽然辭職。不可謂非日本政界當前之一大波瀾也。</p>
<p>按荒木氏爲日本陸軍大學第九期學生。與前任參謀部次長眞崎甚三郎有陸軍雙璧之稱。彼曾遊學於俄羅斯。曾任滿洲方面之特務機關長。當其在第六師團長任内時。始漸露頭角。爲少壯軍人所推重。當一九三一年犬養組</p>
<p>織單一内閣之際。適當九一八事變陡起。東亞風雲緊急中日關係惡化。日本一般少壯軍閥。乃極力鼓吹其所謂非常時期。於是荒木經南次郎之推挽。遂由敎育總監部本部長進而任陸軍大臣。任職之後。盡力發揮其武力侵略之辣腕。先之以瀋陽事變繼之以侵錦州攫熱河威脅平津在日本軍事行動。可謂順利矣。</p>
<p>然而日本之内情。自所謂非常時期高唱入雲後。又加以「精神日本神國日本」之提倡。遂致一般日人。皆處於水深火熱之中。經濟生活。固已日漸困難。卽所謂精神生活。亦復頽喪不堪對社會現實。旣呈悲觀。對將來之瞻望。亦未免渺茫。資本主義之腐惡。已一一暴露。國主義之希望。又何莫非幻想。攻城略地之結果。祇有人民增加租稅之負擔。於是軍部與財閥間之對立。亦愈趨尖銳。極右思想與左傾思想。同時潛滋暗長。更遍佈於日本各級民衆之中。而對外經濟競爭。又惹起世界各國之惡感。外交愈陷於孤立。民政政友兩政黨。見國事之日非。前途之可危。乃於議會開會之際。一變其從前柔順之態度。將於會議内對於軍閥有一番劇烈之質戰。此後議會與軍閥之對立將愈甚。荒木雖顢頇。然在此種形勢下。亦不能不思所以避免。此其所以提出辭呈歟。　　荒木辭職後。繼任人選。不外現任敎育總監林銑十郎。及軍事參議官眞崎甚三郎二人。兹二人者皆爲陸大派。與荒木政策雖有緩急不同之别。實際殊無多大歧異。蓋日本軍閥之傳統政策。爲對外十年一戰主義。任何軍人繼任。皆不致有所變更。故在此種情勢下。以測荒木辭職後之議會。或將有兩種不相同之傾向焉。第一。儀會政治之毫無生氣。日本較歐洲各國爲尤甚。故政友會擁有近三百頭議席之絶對多數。而不敢單獨組閣現在荒木雖已引退。而少壯將校。恐仍將不免起而直接應戰。議會政治之形式。能暫時繼續保持歟。抑法西斯政權將躡齋藤内閣之後歟。第二。日本財閥。已具近代資本主義之具體組織。其不願爲軍人所操縱。勢至明顯。對於挑動戰爭。尤爲彼輩所反對。或將乘荒木辭職之際。打破非常時期之難關。恢復財閥專政之實際歟。抑將愈陷於困難歟。此均非吾人所能預知。惟今日本之外强中乾。非特研究日本情實者知之。卽彼邦有識之議士。亦莫不謂然。如長此繼續下去。殊非日本人民。之福。在荒木總軍政之時。固無法轉變。現在荒木旣去。能有機會使軍國主義之瘋狂。稍見冷靜。亦未始非日本當前危局之轉機也。</p>

<p>（外論社云）日文雜誌外交時報新年特大號載、</p>
<p>一·海陸空軍之關係</p>
<p>大凡觀察將來者、則有澈底研究過去與現在之必要、瑪哈根據歷史之研究、對於將來得到種種敎訓、現任美國海軍部作戰計畫司長之瑪阿斯大佐聲稱「對於將來之預察、要以從來之行動與現在之情况爲基礎構成之、在處理將來事情之際、吾人之指針、則不外措置構成預察之基礎也」、</p>
<p>於是、要明白將來之列國海軍情勢、則須以檢討以往之情勢着手、</p>
<p>軍備爲支持國策之進行而存在、國策之衝突、勢必引起軍備之對立、軍備有陸軍與海軍之則、國情關係陸地較深者則以陸軍爲重、國情關係海洋較深者、則以海軍爲重、然而、世界各大國離有程度之差、而無一對海洋無關係者、因是各國皆不能不持有海軍力也、其中之主要者爲英·美·法·意·日五國、</p>
<p>海洋構通各國、因而浮於海上之海軍亦具有普遍的性質、上列五國俱有海軍之利害關係、而有直接一葦之遠的關係各國、其關係特别深也、比如法德兩國爲隣國、陸軍力雖占有重要之地位、而海軍力亦有相當重要性、又如日美兩國、海軍上之關係更重要也、要之、五大海軍國、不僅在世界上對立、又在地方上亦與其他小海軍國對峙也、</p>
<p>最近由於飛機之發達、海陸軍之分野引起非常之變動、去年十一月三日英國外務次官聲稱「空軍發達之結果、使英國不能作爲一島而採取孤立政策也、」純粹之海洋國、原賴海軍而期國防之安全、而今由於飛機發達之結果、亦恐他國之制空力給予其威脅矣、是則論海軍者、亦不能不論及空軍也、</p>
<p>日本所不滿意之華府及倫敦條約、至一九三五年改訂乎、繼續有效乎、抑或廢棄乎、爲討論此項問題、將舉行海軍軍縮會議、該會議之結果如何、對於世界海軍情勢具有重大之影響、因是對於軍縮問題、則有加以檢討之必要、</p>
<p>本文之目的、厥在探知一九三六年以後之列國海軍情勢、以及根據五大海軍國之國策與海軍力之論述推知其相互關係及結予日本國防之敎訓也、（待續）</p>

<p>爲最近十五年間之最高產額</p>
<p>國聞社云、中華棉業統計會、最近發表去年度全國棉產末次估計報告、兹誌於後、</p>
<p>估計經過　此項估計、係根據（一）河北·山東·河南·陜西·湖北·湖南·江西·安徽·江蘇·浙江·等十一省及上海·天津·兩市之報告、編製而成、（二）以十二月十日以前之棉作狀况爲凖（三）在十二月十日以前、各省棉作所受害災之損失、</p>
<p>均已計算在内、（四）棉田以華畝爲單位、棉產以擔爲單位、估計結果、爲棉田面積四○·四五三·九五三畝、皮棉產額、九·六二一·二四○擔、廢田面積六一七·三九八畝、考二十一年修正估計、棉田面積爲三七·○○九、八○○畝、皮棉產額八·一○五·六三七擔、</p>
<p>兩年比較　此次估計、已可視爲最後實收數量、以九百六十二萬一千二百四十擔、計比較二十一年增加一百五十一萬五千六百零三擔、產量之多、不特爲近年所未有、且爲自民八以降之最大產數、値此國内棉產供不敷求、外棉鉅萬進口之時、實爲較可欣慰之報告、而產額之增加、實由於棉田之增加、棉田增加、以北方爲多、因兵匪之亂稍靖、農民差稱苟安、益以天氣良好、得雨甚足、棉田遂增、冀魯豫陜晋五省土質、最宜植棉、如能設法爲農民謀灌漑之道、而又無戰亂、則棉作之推廣至易、南方產棉、約較北方爲多、自廿年棉產要區之蘇鄂兩省大水、棉由太减、近年雖告恢復、但農村又苦不甚安靖、是棉田之增率、不能追踵北方併進矣、</p>
<p>棉田槪况　本年各省棉田面積、河北·山西·河南·陜西·湖北·江蘇·等省均增、尤以河北·山西·陜西·湖北·江蘇·增加最多、冀省平漢路線、植棉日見發展·山西年來、以地方較靖、棉產復興、豫陜以戰亂不作、榖價又賤、棉田遂多、湖北江蘇、自廿年大水爲災、棉田大减、近年恢復甚速、他省亦逐年進步、因次棉田總額、數年以來、與時併進、本年北方春夏之間、得雨甚豐、棉作均能及時播種、此爲本年北方棉田激增之一大原因、惟山東稍减、秋間又以黃河水災淹田不少、幸退水尚速、未盡失收、</p>

<p>｜答黃秀中君｜</p>
<p>若照你的來信所說，你研究歷史的目的是「想明瞭現社會的過去情形，使我了解現社會所以是這個樣子的原故」，同時你更不希望做一個「史學專家」，則無疑的你計劃中的研究步驟是不適合的。因爲你所採取的乎段，正是專家的入手辦法，而在一般人是不需要這樣做的。換句話說，你正不必走這樣遠的路，像你所抱的這樣的目的，是另有一種正確的研究途徑的。</p>
<p>你所採取的研究步驟的缺點，已如來信所說，但這些還祗不過是初步的，物質條件上的困難，至於將來卽使吃盡辛苦地這樣研究下去，是否能眞個達到你的目的，而免除「雜亂無章毫無系統」的毛病，你却未曾計及，然我們却敢預計這種情形是一定不能免，而且將要愈使你感覺到無法研究。因爲洽學必先有一種正確的方法，離開此不講，是一定要「眼花撩亂」「無從着乎」的。</p>
<p>如果你研究歷史的目的，眞如來信所說，　　那我們却要供獻另外一種辦法。</p>
<p>你所願知的是社會當前的實踐物活動，因而要想去研究人類之實踐的發展過程，那我們以爲你正不必大兜圈子，從上古一直研究到最近世，却要從最近世起研究而推溯到上古。因爲你假如從上而下，就要先用許多時間去解决許多工具上的障礙，從一般不從事專門的研究的人而言，道是很不經濟的，但這還不過是不經濟罷了，苦費了許多時間，而障礙却依舊存在，於是因噎廢食把讀書願望打消，那不但是不經濟，簡直是浪費。並且時代愈古，對於後世的影響也愈少，關係也愈簡單，所以古代的研究，是費時多而得益少，於業餘自修者是很不合算的。</p>
<p>加之你的治史目標，祗是在於更深刻的了解現實，那正可從現實起開始研究，遇到不明瞭其因果關係時，然後再去推溯其原因。所以我們以爲你在開始作初步研究時，儘可先研究各問題。如你願研究政治史，那最初可不必先去看資治通鑑一類的書，却宜先就見聞所及最近發生的各種事實開始：如：近年來之政局，國民黨出師北伐，曹錕賄選等再上遡到辛亥革命。在這些事件中，去考察其由來及因果關係，當然你的槪念自會更正確，更淸晰。這個方法對於我們這玩業餘自舉者，定可節省不少的精力，我以我們對於讀書不贊成用縱的辦法，而贊成用横的辦法。這不但對於吏學是如此主張，任何舉科都是如此。因爲你如果從現實研究到過去，正是一種由淺入深，層層剝　的漸進的辦法；並且與眼前生活接近的現象研究起來也最易感覺到興趣。在業餘自修的人，讀書常常會中斷，假如你用「横」的辦法，好比你製造一件小小的器具，你做一件就是一件。縱的方法則不然，它有如一個大工程，你非做到相當的時期，是不能得到成功的。所以在一般的讀者，我們極希望他們採取這種辦法，而且就是想做專門研究的人，從這個方法入手，以後作進一步的研究，也能得到許多的便利，呂思勉先生所說的：「在理論上言，讀後代史必須探其原於古，方能眞實了解；在事實上言，讀古代史，正須有後代的史爲之對照，乃覺容易了解，」確是治史經騐之談；初學者所應走的途徑。</p>
<p>你現在對於歷史可以說是已經稍具基礎，（因爲你已經讀了許多歷史綱要之類的書）所以我們對於你以後的讀書計畫的意見，見現在暫時可不必再去研究史，而去研究治學方法論，因爲你現在所感到的困難，是感到這些書不能滿足你求知的慾望，但是這些書大都不是材料的不充分，而是觀點的不正確，所以你現在首先應研究一下方法論，等到這個粗通之後，你自己已有了一個中心思想，以後你就可照着這個中心思想去鑒别一切理論，並去分析，研究一切現象，而不至於徘徊歧途了。｜｜康</p>

<h3 id="c190">無聊 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>中國人見面時大都喜歡談談天氣，否則對於「一日三餐」，也可找出許多話來說的；這似乎已經成爲一種公式，隨處都可應用。</p>
<p>有人說這是「無聊」。是呀！中國人本來說裏在「無聊」中生活的，何况現在又遇到這般無聊的年頭！</p>
<p>前天在霞飛路上，無意中遇到一位朋友。那天氣候很陰濕，於是互相埋怨天公一番之後，我問他近來作何消遣，他很不自然的說出一番他所感到無聊的苦痛。</p>
<p>我當時很覺後悔。因爲在這種國亂如蔴民生不安的年頭，雖不必抬出「國難」的鞭策，脅逼靑年們走上奮鬥的軌道；但把寳貴的光陰，硬撥到「消遣」名下，委實說不過去！於是我也感到一種無聊！我們就在這般無聊中分的手。</p>
<p>當我給許多乘客窮兇極惡般的擠上電車後，對於現在一般靑年何以會這等無聊的問題，或許因爲它過於嚴重的緣故，一時無從究討。同時，因爲我那朋友雖到中年仍是一位「童男」，却引起我想到多年前一件「慘案」。</p>
<p>有素昧平生但同在北平讀書的一男一女。不知怎麽緣故，男的覺得無聊，女的也覺得無聊；於是，不謀而合地大家常到「中央公園」去跑跑。不久，漸拍漸合，彼此都覺得「有了」。這可說是一了百了。因爲又經過一次「不久」，他們仍是回到「無聊」，終於沉在昆明湖中「死了」！</p>
<p>山海經上曾說：「蜉蝣交尾後卽墮地死」。照此說來，世間的「蜉蝣」所以不致絶種，就在他必須交過尾自以爲已盡責任，然後才墮地死去。假使中國人而能變成蜉蝣，那末，非特可以免去一切無聊，世界也就易於得救了！</p>
<p>不過，旣稱爲萬物之靈的「人」，他的責任當然不能像蜉蝣那般的簡單。現代靑年的責任是什麽？何以會感到無聊？要是第一個問題能適當的解决了，第二個問題是不會發生的。雖說他們也有感到社會組織之不良，出路問題之艱難，而不能避免，無聊的襲來；但這仍是第一個問題没有能「適當」解决的緣故。</p>
<p>如果他們所感到的是一種「蜉蝣式」的無聊，那豈僅是靑年本身的毁滅，寳在也是國家一種無從補救的損失！</p>
<p>我總覺得中國人對於各種事業太缺乏「苦幹」的精神，「無聊」的呼聲，就在這種精神疏隙的地方衝出來的！</p>
<h3 id="c191">看花燈 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 紅蓼</p>
<p>這裏所有的花燈，並非廢歷正月十五元宵夜所放的紙糊花燈，像走馬燈，兎子燈那一類的東西，這種花燈，一年三百六十五天，天天晚上在照耀，表示它們是大都會的點綴品，也是緊張空氣裏的緩衝帶，但它的作用，却完全和紙糊的走馬燈兎子燈一樣，同時趁着熱閙，供人欣賞的玩意兒，在上海已經無形中占領了某一地段，成了它勢力範圍下的特别區域了！</p>
<p>「玩意兒究竟是什麽？」</p>
<p>「特别區域在那裏？」</p>
<p>告訴你｜這特别區以浙江路六馬路西藏路三馬路爲四址，小花園福裕福祥福致里是它的大本營，羣玉坊三元坊會樂里是它的殖民地，玩意兒的原子是粉紅色的女人，中國人一向稱伊們呌「花」，「燈」是各式各樣的使用電流而發出亮光的東西，商人們慣把它用作廣告的利器的，聰明的「花」們，把伊們自己的花名標在「燈」上，仗着它的五光十色，招徠了些看花男士，「看花燈的解釋如是如是！」</p>
<p>「祇要你腰有纏頭，那管他生張熟魏」這兩句話是「花燈們」對付「玩花燈們」的一個傳統政策，於是大好花燈，就離開了大衆，單給那些腹便而面團團的去欣賞了！剩下這些酸溜溜的措大門，時常不免要從這所謂特别區域裏經過，「燈」是照樣給你看見了，可是「花」呢，你除却偶然地嗅到一些從它身上自然地在播送的一股中人欲嘔的氣味以外，别的念頭，休轉了罷。</p>
<h3 id="c192">高帽子 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 穆因</p>
<p>以前，有一位秀才，新得了某縣的知事，臨上任的時候，照例要到老師的家裏去辭行。他的老師向他說：「某縣的士紳非常刁狡，你初次作官，此去有什麽依仗？」</p>
<p>「只是依仗着我自己的學問。」秀才毫不遲疑地這樣的回答。</p>
<p>「學問中什麽用呢？」他的老師連連摇着自己的腦袋。</p>
<p>「我帶了一百二十頂高帽子。」秀才接着告訴了他的老師。</p>
<p>「高帽子又中什麽用呢？」他的老師仍連連摇着自己的腦袋。</p>
<p>「老師的威名，誰都知道，我會告訴他們，我是老師的學生，他們自然關照我了。」秀才改換了語調。</p>
<p>「這還可以……」他的老師立刻停止了腦袋的摇動，微微地笑。</p>
<p>「老師！我的一百二十頂高帽子，現在只剩一百十九頂了。」秀才緊接着告訴他的老師。</p>
<p>「爲什麽少了一頂呢？」他的老師怔着問。</p>
<p>「那一頂給老師戴上了。」秀才也微微地笑。</p>
<p>這種高帽子，從古來就人人愛戴，到現在似乎更加時髦了。有一些人，爲了飾掩自己的醜惡，不惜從他人的頭上，把這種帽子搶過來戴在自己的頭上。這顯然的告訴我們，高帽子在現在已成了無價的寳物，會給人戴高帽子，又似乎是現在的生活上一種必具的本領。</p>

<p>别瞧不起這位胡說瞎道，眼開眼閉的先生，（因爲盲目，才去賣卜，不過賣卜者，未必個個都是瞎子，儘多借着這幌子，做誘財好色的勾當）。他實在操着人生婚姻上的權威，隨你這樣地志同道合，心心相印，只要經他三言兩語，便把一對比翼鴛鴦，輕描淡寫的拆散了。世間不知有多少曠怨男女，都是由他花言巧語所媾成的，情天恨海，冥冥之中，自有操縱，好在善男信女，是唯命是聽的，儘他天花亂墜，總是言聽計從，就是將來發生了不幸，也是前生註定，與人無尤，他倒是一位拉攏怨偶的專家。倘如求世間無怨偶，初步工作，便是打倒星卜。</p>

<p>第二十三回　創痛難堪凝神聽鼓樂歡情未洽促别飛符到</p>
<p>這不但是趙家要開始忙亂，楊家也就跟着忙亂起來。趙自强回家以後，也曾和桂枝打過兩個照面。因爲桂枝是快要作新娘的人了，若是在人前和自强說話。怕來往的親友看到，要開什麽玩笑，所以祗是阿自强看着一眼，表示我知道你回來，依然遠避開了去。自强本來想，找着機會，和桂枝說上兩句，但是轉念到快要結婚了，有什麽話到了蜜月裏去，儘可以從從看看的談着現在忙些什麽呢？所以在見着桂枝的時候，有人呢，他就對桂枝看一看了事。没有人呢，就低聲笑着道：你這幾天該忙了。有什麽東西，要我替你預備的嗎。桂枝自然是笑着說不要什麽。此外，二人却没有什麽接洽。但是桂枝心裏，這時却懷着一個疑問，像家裏這些親友，來來往往的忙着，對門住着的甘積五，不知作何感想。因爲母親對於這件事，是疑心很重的，當然不便問得。除了母親，若是去問第二個人，也更引着嫌疑，所以心理雖不免納悶，也就祗將是納悶而已。但是他情想的倒是對了積之不曾加回海甸，對於他的境遇如何，也就不必十分去掛心。及至回了海甸以後，偏是和桂枝見過一面，看出他一縷芳心，依然繫掛在自己身上，不曾變更。加之第二步，桂枝忽然不見，分明是把他幽閑起來了。他若是要避開我的話，那回見着我，就不應當對那樣情致纏綿了。他心裏正在徘徊不定的時候，看到趙家大門裏面，進出的人，忽然繁雜起來，便有點詫異，於是常懷着在門外散步，打量對門的情形。（二九七）</p>

<p>現代的婦女，常常爲了身體過於肥胖，不但减少其容姿的美觀，而且因爲身體肥胖，心臟的呼吸，也感到很不自由，其他有連帶關係的動脈硬化，血壓亢進等毛病，隨之而發生了，最厲害的，突然患了心臟麻痺與腦充血等危險病，甚至患了肺結核，以致傷生而死的。又因肥胖的緣故，生殖器發生障碍，肝臓起了異狀，神經炎糖尿病等附帶病都要連續而生的。雖則身體肥胖的人，微菌比較爲少，但是一旦發生了傳染病，那比身體瘦弱的人，容易傳染。所以全世界肥胖的人，其死亡率比瘦的人爲多。普通的體質，在四五月時候，吸收了脂肪，到了夏季，就漸漸消瘦了，肥胖的人，若是在冬季，過於食了脂肪的物，那增加脂肪量，到了夏季，愈加苦痛，而且因爲肥胖的緣故，原來的美感，就爲其所奪，尤其對於年輕的婦女，不可不十分注意的。最近歐美有閑階級的婦女，肥胖的人，逐年增加，現今發明了脂肪中樞說，這種病我國婦女比歐美人爲尤多，就是因爲常食澱粉性的頭等米，其脂肪遂逐漸增加了。所以肥胖的婦女們，到了冬季食慾亢進的時節，千萬不可多食含有脂肪過多的食物，譬如肉類精米以及油分過多的物，，那就可以抑制甲狀腺的發達，因爲肥胖人在冬季時不多食脂肪的食物，到了翌年春夏，能照身體新陳代謝的發育原理，漸漸旺盛，不爲發生阻碍的，尤其要注意運動，把過剩的脂肪分减少活潑其發育機能，使身長與體重的感覺，漸得均整，實爲促進健美的要件。</p>

<p>— 楚玉</p>
<p>婦女身體過於肥胖，，固然要减少美感，然而骨瘦如柴，也不雅觀，現在我把實騐肥胖方法據出來，請瘦弱的婦女們，試騐一下。（一）雞骨湯洽瘦法，每日用雞骨一副，須具全身骨骼，和以靑菜煮湯，（用文火燉到骨酥）稍加鹽分，分三次飲，旣很鮮美，又極滋補，倘繼續吃了半個月，不過吃了十五隻雞，費不掉十元錢，就可以證明有效的。假使辦得到烏骨雞，尤爲靈騐，但是心身須要安靜，切不可躁煩，再加以適當的運動，那身體就會達到相當的健康美的。（二）縛腹帶使肥法，大凡蒲柳質的婦女，常患神經衰弱，消化不良，便秘，失眠等症，要想肥胖，可用長六尺闊五寸的布一條，在腰腹的下面（臍下）丹田縛緊，帶頭結在左方，身體運動時，依照牽引性均分其姿勢，每天多食豆類，麵類，糙米等，臨睡時平均姿態靜坐十分鏡，那末身體没有過與不足的害，可以逐漸健美了。（三）飲水與乾布摩擦法，每晨空腹飲淸水一杯，午前十時飲二杯，午飯前飲一杯，午後三時飲二杯，晚飯前飲一杯，每日飲的分量與時間，須要一定，不可遲早，同時每日起床時與臨睡時，用乾布摩擦全身二次，擦法先從背中起，再擦胸腹手足，至皮膚紅赤爲度，不上一個月，就會肥胖的。（四）食物滋養與精神生活法，食物原會吸收滋養料的，如山芋蔬菜麵類豆類雞卵牛乳魚類等，每天須吸取一定的分量，隔日又吃獸肉一次，吃時不可過飽，亦不可少吃，且須有一定時間。精神的治法，第一要心神安靜。第二在日常生活須有正當的規律，第三須充分吸收新鮮空氣。第四力避過度的運動，照這樣實行，不但普通的人，可以增加健全美，就是患肺病的人，也可以治療的，以上所據四種方法，都是實騐而來的，瘦弱的婦女們，不妨試騐一下啊。</p>

<p>靑光勝夏光　夏光主將林啓仁、已於上週南旋省親、實力大形減落、關洵安又姗姗來遲、陣綫不免散漫、然開始頗見活躍、陳肇球首先罰中、靑光突進、頃刻以六比一超出、黃劍飛忽告奮勇、連擲帶罰、追成各六、惟此後則一蹶不振、靑光越抛越遠、陸大振屢告妙中、伍純武大腹便便竟亦先後命中兩球、結果四五比二七、靑光獲得勝利、</p>

<h3 id="c235">屠塲 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>聽說美國支加哥地方，有一個規模宏大的屠塲，其中最駭人聽聞的是一架巨大的殺牛的機器，簡直令我想像不出那是怎樣的裝置；據說每天有成羣的牛，數十頭或數百頭，活生生地被人驅進機器裏去，而從另一面出來的時候，已經没有活牛了，牛皮牛骨牛肉分得乾乾凈凈的。</p>
<p>我時常想像着這架神妙的機器，彷彿總覺得它是有所象徴。</p>
<p>隨手翻閱着每天的報紙，我們總可以看到像那機器殺牛一樣，這近代的惡魔似的大城市屠殺了無數人類的生命；也正像被驅逐進那可怕的大機器裏去的牛一樣，從經濟破產的農村或因水旱荒災而變成的饑饉的區域，有無數饑餓的人類被驅逐到這殺人的城市裏來。</p>
<p>但他們不像牛，是凖備來被人宰割，被人剝奪去生命，分割皮骨血肉的；他們是要求生，是要求生的工作而來的呀！然而這城市給他們凖備下的唯一的生路祗有忍饑耐凍乞討在街道上，等待着那最後的死亡。如果他們是有勇氣的，在一陣激憤的狂吼之後，可以拿生命來作一份買賣，較好的作小偷作竊賊，更兇的作强盜作綁票匪，若能苟安一時總算是幸運，萬一事發也不比那早就死在路上的更壞；還有那更軟弱的，連作惡的門路都不會有，他們眞的變成了牛，携妻抱子自動投身到黃浦江，或是先親手殺掉最親愛的人，然後自尋短見。</p>
<p>這些我們時常聽到看到，而並不感到怎樣，比有人告訴我們支加哥的那殺牛的巨大的機器，還更少驚異，因爲這城市是龐大得多了，不像我們在想像那機器殺牛的事時那樣的具體，然而我們能够就說這近代的城市不比那每日殺牛的機器更爲可怕麽？</p>
<h3 id="c236">略談文藝 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>昔王世貞嘗作文章九命：一曰貧困，二曰嫌忌，三曰玷缺，四曰偃蹇，五曰流貶，六曰刑辱，七曰夭折，八曰無終，九曰無後。後復增加惡疾，合爲十命。文章於人，有十大罪惡，人固無罪，罪在文章，此『有筆階級』不可不知者也！</p>
<p>吾今宣布文藝罪狀，僅舉大端，約而計之，其罪有三：</p>
<p>士先器識，而後文藝。一爲文人，便無足觀。人而無用，文藝尸之。此文藝之大罪一也。</p>
<p>德行本也，文藝末也。行有餘力，則以學文。人而無行，文藝尸之。此文藝之大罪二也。</p>
<p>顔之推云，文章之體，標舉興會，發引性靈，使人矜伐，故忽于操持，果于進取。今世文士，此患彌切，一事愜當，一句淸切，神厲九霄，志凌千載，自吟自賞，不覺更有傍人。人而招禍，文藝尸之。此文藝之大罪三也。</p>
<p>吾數文藝罪狀，至三已畢。翻閱新聞，又加一罪。厥罪維何？有妨數學。擴而充之，禍延科學。古文已矣，白話代興。摘錄某先生之言如下：</p>
<p>………中國人是向來討厭數目字的，『大槪』『大約』等籠統副詞每每是中國人的口頭禪。一般中學生都有討厭數學的傾向，因爲文藝書籍的引誘，常常以『性情不近』爲理由，就將數學一筆抹刹，這實在是危險不過的事情。現在的科學是建在數學上面的，數學打進去的學術，才能確定成爲科學。譬如數學打進了天文的範圍，天文學就成爲凖３確的科學，其他物理學化學心理學經濟學等也莫不如是。這幾年來，各大學新生入學考試，一千本數學試卷中間，打零分的約在五百本以上。數學程度低劣到這個地步，還談什麽科學的研究？</p>
<p>某先生之言，精警透闢。若非文藝書籍引誘，中學生何以不肯深研數學？若非數學程度低劣，何以中國竟無科學研究可言？持此而言，中國科學上未能進步，以致文化落後，民族倒霉，原是文藝之罪。嗚呼文藝，汝之罪惡誠不勝枚舉矣！</p>
<h3 id="c237">客人 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 道武</p>
<p>這天來了客人。</p>
<p>妻子打開門，見是客人降臨，忙高聲喊道：</p>
<p>「建湖，姑媽和阿嫂來了」！似乎是警告着他。這警告果然震撼了他，駭了他一大跳。</p>
<p>於是丈夫迎出來，兩人一面張羅這兩位尊客請坐，一面暗暗地你望望我，我望望你，心裏都很明白，然而不得已的互相探問着：怎麽辦呢？</p>
<p>這兩位客人是非常尊貴的，一位是妻子的姑媽，一位是這姑媽的新媳婦。姑媽不常來，而她的新媳婦更是來第一次　　姑媽坐定了，開口說：「媳婦過門來還没有出來過幾趟，我想趁天氣好，把幾家親戚帶她走走，以後大家好常見面。今天第一家先到你們這兒。因爲你們最遠，不容易來。」</p>
<p>她說明了來意，主人們連忙附和着，表示歡迎。丈夫喚妻子：「快拿一點什麽點心來吧。」</p>
<p>妻子滿口應着，眼睛却很很地釘住他，似乎問「點心在什麽地方」？於是她吩咐丈夫快去冲開水。並且姑媽是抽烟的，順便帶一包零烟。</p>
<p>兩人紛紛地退到裏面，妻埋怨丈夫：「點心怎麽辦呢？家裏米也没有，還有什麽點心？」</p>
<p>丈夫一手提着水壺，一手向她伸出來，輕輕喊道：「昨晚剩下的銅板好買水，那麽，烟錢呢？一他似乎報復了她。然而果然怎麽辦呢？他想不出來。</p>
<p>妻從枕下取出兩角小洋遞給他，「快去買一點什麽點心。」他接過來，放下水壺從後門飛跑。不久他帶了好幾個紙包裹回來，口中喘着氣，妻正從外面拿了玻璃杯碟進來，客人在外面高聲說：「不用費事。以後要常來的，何必客氣？」</p>
<p>妻一面應着，一面問丈夫，「怎麽辦」？丈夫皺皺眉，摇着頭焦燥的答道：「這都是你的親戚，我有什麽辦法。」</p>
<p>妻生了氣，兩人幾乎因此拌起嘴來，但隨後兩人都似乎給什麽驚醒，妻捧着兩個盛好點心的碟出去了，丈夫呆立在裏面，心想渡過了第一道難關了，現在第二道如何過去呢？</p>
<p>妻含着笑一轉身進來，又苦着臉。丈夫問，「現在應得買一包香烟，錢還有的吧？」</p>
<p>妻驚詫道：「烟還没有買？｜｜爲什麽不一道買來？」</p>
<p>他被她提醒了，自己眞是失算，但答道：「通通買點心，還不够，還抽得出錢買烟？」</p>
<p>她發着楞，隨後忽然記起來，迅速地打開衣箱，抽出一件剛做好還不曾上身的夾旗袍摔給他。</p>
<p>「還有别的嗎，這一件你還没有上過身哩。」</p>
<p>「還不趕快，管什麽上身不上身」？妻幾乎高聲地喊出來。丈夫一轉身，提起水壺出去了。他來不及再躊躇。</p>
<p>轉了兩三家當店，店裏的朝奉就好像故意爲難他似的。他最後生氣的喊道：「隨便你高興罷，當了算了。｜｜這是一件没有上過身的新旗袍呀，你看。一他痛心的接過來又遞上去。……</p>
<p>他帶着一張當票，兩張鈔票回來，心下似乎寬舒了許多。隨後他們留客人吃了飯，丈夫和妻都很滿意地欵待客人，兩人時時互相倫望着，傳達各人的安慰飯後妻陪着姑媽和新嫂嫂談天，丈夫很安心地在房中來回散步。話題忽然轉到了打牌，姑母是歡喜打牌的。她不經心地提議道：</p>
<p>「我們今天來打幾圈好不好？」</p>
<p>他們幾乎給驚倒了。妻望着丈夫，不響。他裝出很鎭定的樣子，連聲附和，同時心下計算還剩下兩三個雙毫。他催着妻去請房東太太來參加，或者自己可以不上桌充角色，逃出這難關。</p>
<p>妻果然把房東太太請來了，並且帶了牌來。介紹之後，拉開桌椅，姑媽和房東太太先坐上去，還空着左右兩家。丈夫知道無可逃避，坐上了，妻一定要拉新嫂嫂坐下去，新嫂嫂謙遜說：「不會」，於是兩人推辭起來，這紛爭不容易解决。</p>
<p>爭論的結果，是由姑媽指定新媳婦上塲。她知道姪女還得招待客人，料理事體，不能打。這是經過她的審愼，體貼地决定的。</p>
<p>牌一直繼續到天黑，吃過了晚飯，照姑媽的意思，還得再打下去，幸虧新嫂嫂要走。</p>
<p>計算勝負，丈夫輸了，欠下新嫂嫂兩塊多。可怎麽辦呢？他問妻子：「你身上還有錢嗎？給我。」他明知她是没有的，然而不能不問。</p>
<p>然而出於意外地妻拿出兩張鈔票給他。於是毫無困難地結束了。客人不經意地收了錢告辭，他們一直送到街口。</p>
<p>回來以後，丈夫長長地舒了一口氣，忽然記起了，笑問道：「剛纔的兩張鈔票是那裏來的？」妻苦笑着向床上𠴂𠴂�</p>
<p>嘴。他一看，那上面却少了一床被。他嘆嘆氣，兩人祗好相對苦笑着。</p>
<h3 id="c238">回敎徒不吃猪肉的問題（續） <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 馬憶源</p>
<p>第二次是與一個駐在里昻的埃及留學生監督的談話。他的解說是這樣：</p>
<p>「經是垂諸萬世的，所以在科學不發達的當時，眞主已禁止我們食用猪肉了。及至近世科學發達，像德國柏林市底屠宰塲對於猪肉雖不禁吃，其檢查也就特别嚴了！</p>
<p>柏林市每日殺猪約數千頭，屠塲中設特别檢騐室，分兩部分，每部分置十五人，屠塲時每頭猪底左右腰子各割一塊，編記號碼，然後彚送此室，經分别檢騐無毒後方才唯予發買。因爲猪體内寄生有一種微生蟲名呌trichina（旋毛蟲）可以使人生病。所以我以爲回敎禁食猪肉是完全因衛生起見，至於摸觸並未見有明文禁止，但倘使徧身汚濁，就不是猪，我們也不願去接近啊。</p>
<p>像那養猪營利，我却以爲不應該，要算違背敎旨。可是貴國回敎徒底狂避猪與猪肉，甚而異敎人所奉的茶都不肯用，又未免矯枉過正一點。」</p>
<p>第三次是在巴黎近年才建築的淸眞寺内訪問三位亞拉伯人。他們都是「一駡目」（卽長敎）。經我提出問題後，他們便作以下的解說：</p>
<p>「可蘭經禁止我們吃猪肉，我們就應當不吃。用衛生底理由，借科學底智識來辯解是不對的。我們須要淸潔，猪旣齷齪，當然用不着特意去摸觸牠。血跡糢糊的肉，不止是猪的，都足汚損我們的衣物，汚了洗濯使凈也就彀了。經典上禁止的只是吃，别的没有根據。」　「假使有人說肥皂是猪油製成的，回敎人不可用，對嗎？」我又問。</p>
<p>「不說肥皂絶没有用猪油製成的，卽使是用猪油製成的，只要你是用來去垢，儘可用得，因爲我們僅禁「吃」猪肉」　　「牙刷是猪髻製成的，回敎人可用來入口刷牙嗎？」</p>
<p>「可以，因爲你只用來刷牙，而經文禁止的是「吃猪肉。」你只要忠實於經文的禁令就够了。從前有人問過一位大學者，倘使一個小牛是吃猪奶長成的，這個小牛回敎人可以吃嗎？他回答可以，因爲牛仍舊是牛，没有變成所禁食的動物，所以吃得。我敎是極自由，極寬大的敎，只看這個解釋便知我敎底精神爲何如了」。</p>
<p>綜觀以上三次談話，證明我外祖底主張確有道理。我國回敎徒除却一不吃猪肉」以外的種種關於飲食上的禁忌，殊足增加與異敎人底隔閡，並且限制回敎徒職業底發展，致回敎大衆特加一層生活上底困難。我希望我這篇文章能帮助他們考慮，在不背敎義底立塲上從事習慣底改良，那麽於溝通一般的感情和擴展回敎大衆職業底範圍等事上，也許不無多少益處呢。（完）</p>

<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>他說着，把乎指揷入她的髮裏撫着，他那抖戰的手，使她的頭髮被牽得疼痛；可是她極力忍着，没有敢說出什麽來。</p>
<p>她看着父親穿上睡衣，臥到床上去了，她親自把紗帳理得整齊一點。然後道着晚安，輕輕地走出去了，她回到了自己的臥室。</p>
<p>那晚上有很好的月光，透過了窗紗，把窗紗上的花照在地上。她躺在床上，靜靜地諦聽着整個的天地中没有一點聲息。她想到那没有見過的母親，獨自在腦中摹畫着，漸漸地睡着了這一夜她連續地做着夢，那些夢裏都閃着父親的臉，到早晨天還没有大亮，就醒轉來了，跳下床就向着父親的臥室走去。當她推開門的時候，才只開了能够走過一個人的空隙，就被什麽阻住了。她没有用力去推，扁了身子勉强地鑽了進去。她登時看到父親睡在門口的地板上，嘴角那裏還有口水流出，兩只空酒瓶倒在他的身傍。</p>
<p>突然間她器起來了，她覺得他不是她的父親，只是一個惡人。她胸中積蓄的悲哀都湧起來了，她伏到床上大聲地器着。</p>
<p>道哭聲驚醒了睡在地上的父親，他醒轉來，抬起眼睛望到她，慚愧似地摇着頭，强自用乎臂支撑着身子。他長長地嘆了一口氣，因爲没有力，就又躺在地上。</p>
<p>聽到他的嘆息的女兒，忍住悲慟，止住出聲的哭泣，把臉從手掌裏抬了起來，看見他那可憐的樣子，自然地站起來，抽噎着走到他睡倒的地方，俯下身去把他扶起來，讓他坐到有靠背的矮椅上。她自己也走到床邊坐下了。</p>
<p>他坐在那裏，默默地不作一聲，他的眼睛裏漸漸地也有了兩顆淚珠，慢慢地成爲更大更大，就順着面頰流了來。他的臉苦痛地扭着，像是有什麽話要說出來又不能够，他的眼淚是更多地流了下來。</p>
<p>「爸，您不是愛我，您不是愛我！」</p>
<p>她喃喃地說，臉只是平淡的，看不出一點表情。好像是對於如此的父親不必多所牽掛，也不必關心着了。</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈先穏後平之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、雖回小一角零、惟因近期略有客帮交易、故開價時、市面雖較前週續好半分左右、旋則多頭回出、遠期月份、廠家亦微出檔、致市氣復呈疲象、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易稍繁、惟因業外之購買、實在稀少、各盤中多空均屬了結交易、爭競甚少、市氣遂又軟弱、結果本月份較小二厘半、二三月份小五厘、四月份小一分半、五月份小七厘半、六月份則上下一無做開、</p>

<p>昨日期麥市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈微俏之態、洋麥報價、雖回小一角零、惟市塲賣出籌碼、逐步緊縮、因所到之洋麥、大部份均屬廠家、故交易所之套貨、不能湧旺、市上需要略增、人心遂易帶起、結果本月份較前週好二分、四月份好一分、餘則均無比較、現麥因各廠無意、仍未做開、</p>

<p>前日海軍上將杜錫珪出喪，凡所經過的路由，路祭的地方很多。觀者人山人海，莫不引領跂足，欲一飽眼福爲快。</p>
<p>及至出喪經過，而儀仗十分簡單，祇有軍樂隊數事，不像盛杏生出喪那樣豪闊，觀者大爲失望。</p>
<p>我想杜錫珪爲什麽生前不多撈幾個錢，等出喪的時候，多擺些「華容道」出來，讓路人稱心滿意的看看。</p>
<p>現在不論那一界的人，尤其是漢奸奸商，拚命撈錢，不顧一切，或者也爲這樣一回事麽？然而前淸儀仗，政府已下令嚴禁了。</p>
<h3 id="c270">看戲 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 美</p>
<p>「不談國事，只談風月」。一九三四年的文人，似乎都有這一種趨向。其實，在這年頭，國事有什麽談頭；那末，挪開國事，還是來談談戲經罷！</p>
<p>據說：現在的戲子，最走紅運，最易賣錢的，要算靑衣花衫了｜普通我們就稱做花旦，大槪花旦出塲，總在最末一齣，俗語呌做「壓台戲」：凡做「壓台戲」的，非色藝雙絶，和具有莫大的本領，和魔力者不克勝任，否則不到散塲，台下觀衆走個一乾二凈，豈不大大的摕興｜所以，現在一般舞台的角兒，雖然有鬚生，花臉，武生，小丑，之類的分别，但掛頭牌，賺大包銀的，却大都是花旦。</p>
<p>失業的人，雖然在都市裏一批一批的增加，但是娛樂塲所，却也隨之而日增，若問這是什麽道理，那末，只有大舞台對過天曉得；但在另一方面，正可以表現出大中華民國的民族性｜吃飯可以不吃，看戲不可不看。上海自從一二八滬戰以來，市况調敝，一落千丈，商店老間，雖然把「大减價」的幌子，來吸引一般購買力薄弱的小市民層；但是年底結出賬來，總是負債超過資產，於是有的在裁員减薪，有的只好關門大吉。照理，市况這樣的蕭條衰落，人們早就應該絶跡娛樂塲所了！但現在却恰恰相反！</p>
<p>話又得說回來啦！上海人畢竟眼福不淺，只要老子爺有錢，咱看咱的戲·幹麽，要你管！</p>
<p>一九三四年聞幕，社會舞台宣佈了二齣好戲：一齣是武藝出衆六齡神童主演的「兒童年」一；一齣是花容月貌才藝無雙馳名南北×派正宗靑衣花衫主演的「婦女國貨年」。若照現在舞台界一般的狀態看來，「婦女國貨年」當然是「壓台戲」。這兩齣戲，現在還正在敲　上台，一般戲迷，雖然爲巨幅廣告所眩，抱着絶大的希望來看這兩齣名角登台唱做兼工文武全才的好戲，但在没有演出以前，誰也不能確定他們的成績。不過我始終盼望他們能够給觀衆喝聲采，讚聲好；不要使人失望才好。假使做得不好的話，也要請大家原諒，因爲這本來是娘兒們一時高興，又却不過多方紳商學界的情商，才來這裏客串一下。萬一觀衆們大聲地喝起倒采來，或者不待散塲，大家跑得一乾二凈，那却未免掃興，在娘兒們的面子上也不好看！</p>

<p>聽說今年是「婦女國貨年」，又是「兒童年」，這好像是大人先生們的兼差，固不足奇；惟國貨究竟能否眞由婦女身上得了救？成千萬，少衣缺食的貧苦兒童，能否眞因此而得提高地位？這因「三字經才開頭」，再過三百三十幾天，才好靜聽佳算，此刻還是Ｏuestion</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Ｍark。若性急兒，一定要卜今年究竟是什麽貨眞價實的年？某雖不才，敢應之曰：「學生倒霉年」｜有「文」爲證：　　先被綁票，繼被撕票，而投屍於井中；房子忽然倒塌，受了傷亡；甚至因爲「不正動」，餉以外國湯糲，這都是最近發生的學生倒霉事，惟以其發生於年前，故撇開不講。</p>
<p>發生於新春年頭的，計有：</p>
<p>「有些學生，是純爲文憑讀書；還有時得了文憑，未嘗讀書。其對於國家的貢獻，不外摇旗呐喊………釀成政治上之腐化經濟上之破產，社會上之不案………」此其一。</p>
<p>「………我們不禁喟然長嘆：知道熱河之亡，不止是亡於湯玉麟，大學畢業生不知道赤峯是中國的領士，中國還不應該亡嗎？」此其二。</p>
<p>「湖南學生，多不接受軍事訓練，謂本人不願當軍閥，故無須軍訓。省立一中，師範第九班生，不受軍訓畢業考試，觸當局怒，命令全班，一律開除。學生立具悔過書，校長及敎廳長，力爲斡旋，均無效！」此其三。</p>
<p>上列三大盤「排骨」，請客的主人翁天然不是一個，而應邀的嘉賓，自然都是學生，當此珍味，未識吃消得下否？</p>
<p>某雖早離學界，無福與宴，但自九一八以後，已三年不知肉味，不禁垂延佳餚，厚顔一爲不速之客，好像老孫之偷仙桃，一樣嘗他一下，覺得這三大盤　品　　名雖同，奇味各殊：　　　　第一盤似乎酸性太大，尤其最後一連三　，想因盛器是銅盤，時久與酸性大起化學作用，復發生一股「愛克司」味，誠非靑年學生所能下嚥；可惜好吃，而且也是當吃的上賓，未曾邀着，吃不了也許會留給主人也未定。</p>
<p>第二盤似乎主人錯放了生薑，故連自己也要噓氣發嘆；但也不覺甚怪，祗可惜未邀第一盤菜主人陪坐首席，减色不少，也許第一主人在先請客不周，故第二主人無須回敬。</p>
<p>第三盤菜不惜多用辣蕉，學生究因嫩嘴軟舌，無怪連忙敬謝不敏呢？</p>

<p>｜戀愛與結婚｜</p>
<p>不見你又有好些時候了，想你生活過得很好。我呢，托福，還是和往昔一樣的生，祇不過多了幾個香烟罐和一大堆煩惱。</p>
<p>本來我的生活是頗安閒的；祇是魔鬼擾人，偏要分我一份淸福艶福，派我一點煩惱的緣兒，倒使得我這懶於講話的人，提起西洋筆桿向你灑文了。</p>
<p>嗚呼，吾友，我的一段戀史你豈不知道？麗是愛我的，這來得多麽坦白而自然，可是却偏有岔路兒，並偏要我去走岔路。</p>
<p>我素來很古怪，你是知道的。我認定祇要對方是眞心的愛我了，便用不着第三者來問否。我當她是個友人，是個情婦，祇要她甘願。那個有兒女的人不是先前來過這一套兒，難道他一弄出兒女出來了，他便可以大擺其臭架？</p>
<p>事情是這樣的，說出來也讓你去氣氣吧！前幾天，我想麗出來和我談天，　　我失約　，臨時我又去電　　她，結果她却破天之荒給你一個不來了，談天不能竟惹得嘆天。信去的第二天，她姗姗而來。一見面便倒在我懷流眼淚，她帶哭帶訴的給我講着，原來她父親知道是愛我了，並知道我愛她，也並知道我們愛得很厲害。於是偏要和我們來岔一下，不訂婚約，便不准麗見我了。</p>
<p>朋友，你看這傢伙多麽混天下之大賬！</p>
<p>你知道，我是一逕不受那個的束縛，說我是愛着她，願爲她犧牲什麽都可以的，就是她和我同居了，同居之後又分居，分居之後還要我犧牲，我近是没有什麽話說。不過定要逼着我上枷鎖，那是我砍頭都不來。她老子的要訂婚，要結婚，無非想假儀式來束我。是想使我活囚着，死守她。你着這是多麽的滑稽，竟把我這樣小看了。</p>
<p>你想：訂婚結婚是多麽滑稽的把戲，一個人的愛，不愛，豈會由你擺佈得這樣簡單？假使我不愛她了，結婚的儀式，豈又阻得我，使那離婚免得着？就是一個戒指也不換，你便知道我們不會厮守一千年？眞是滑稽滑稽！混賬混賬！</p>
<p>朋友，我是澈底反對結婚的，我認爲要來這一套，簡直是愛情的陰謀！旣是愛情的結合，就得愛來維持。假使想以那醜惡的條文來維持這愛的給合，那來，但煩惱是煩惱，到底主張是主張！你要知道我是不屈服的啊！</p>
<p>麗或許會不顧她的父親了，她說三日後便來和我實行同居。來不來，還是未知的事，但拿這來試試她，她是否易來不易去的了。</p>
<p>正經寫來，假使祇博得你一笑，那我眞要駡你一聲混蛋了。</p>
<p>回信有不有，聽尊便可也！因爲來不來，我都不在乎。再見。</p>

<p>— 木</p>
<p>今天接父親來信，對於我前信說及自己在上海賣文爲生只能自給，勿過倚賴的話，父親信裏說「所云勿過倚賴，此言使我欲哭無淚！我雖膝下子多，無奈各懷私心，亦無如你之才學資格，他們所入不敷，故難顧家；且惜父無才無德不能感動兒輩，家中老父幼弟妹已經雖吃稀粥亦難以維持，你列長兄應作模範爲諸弟法，才是道理一。又接四弟來信說：「我現在病狀愈加沉重，擊帶愈於淤塞，相離不上幾步，說話的時候對方已經聽不淸楚，在敎室中授課，小學生坐在後排的已經時說聽不見，奈何奈何？離放假期不上一月，現在只好竭力維持下去，明年才來設法休養。其實經濟這樣困迫，就要休養，也有所不能，聽之而已。完了孽債更好，嗚呼！」</p>
<p>古人因爲交通不便關山遠阻而且適逢亂世，所以有「家書勝萬金」的詩句，我現在接到這「勝萬金」的家書，雖然亦覺得足以慰我懐念，然而家書是這樣的一字一淚，呌人怎不憂愁與難過的啊！</p>
<p>讀了家書，呆了半嚮，對於年老的父親，晚境如斯，已屬難過，何况他老人家還要維持着一個十幾口腹要充饑的城市破落户的家庭呢？他老人家一生没有享樂過，做生意的時候是絞盡心血以維持將要破產的局面，他不懂得什麽是娛樂，他更不懂得什麽是消遣，他只知道怎樣設法子維持生意的事；到了家庭破產以後，他老人家却又只知道怎樣設法子節省用途維持家庭的生活，並且要怎樣設法子使小弟妹入學以求智識，…他到現在是頭髮也白了，鬍子也白了，終日還是在設法找錢來給一家十幾口腹充饑，和小弟妹上學買用品。他所希望的是我們長大了的兒子寄錢顧家，可是除了四弟和七弟之外，六弟和八弟是失業着，我呢，在這人浮於事的大都市上賣文爲生只足自給！父親呵，城市的破落户人家不能够維持生活的多着呢！農村經濟破產以來，住在鄉下的莊稼人家何曾不是也一樣的窮困？我們是中國的窮人之羣裏頭的一份子，我們旣不是工人也不是農民，我們這城市破落户的家庭是没落的小資產階級，時代與階級於我們是没有法子挽回我們的悲劇底運命呵！…</p>
<p>家庭所倚賴的是我們長大了的兒子，四弟負病在敎書，七弟曾在南洋來信說因爲石印繪畫的工作過勞吐血，恐怕要受歇工的處分，這兩個弟弟爲什麽偏是要害病的呢？四弟信來說「完了孽債更好，」，想起了少年夭殤的三弟五弟與二妹，他們在那時候曾經要過我的眼淚，如今想來他們早死了對於家庭對於社會不負責任，他們更是快樂的呵！我們如今求死不能，對於人生還得奮鬭下去，盡了做人的義務，快樂是不敢希望，痛苦那是非硬着頭皮迎受上去不行，｜這就是人生呵！</p>
<p>繆崇羣先生登載「自由談」上「跣足的人」末了他說，「死，是相當的有它的本身的嚴肅吧？不過我想，就是那麽喊着也好：（抬棺材的喊着哀，賀，）他們喊的是「哀」，同時接着的便是「賀」，一個人的兩面意義都好像有了。人生走到死的路上的時候，固然在某一方面的意義是可哀，可是在另一方面也就是可賀的呵！然而，我們｜父親喲弟弟喲｜在這一家十幾口腹在等着充饑的家庭的義務放在我們的肩頭上的現在，死，對於我們只有可哀，有什麽可賀呢？還有　社會課給我們的義務｜也需要我們去盡責，我們如果死，那是自私，可賀就是自私的啊！</p>
<p>人生如果只是爲己，那就有如享樂主義者的醉生夢死，根究起來也未免枯燥無味。没有理想｜爲社會爲人類創造幸福的理想，並非單純的爲自己享樂的理想｜的生活，那是任誰都難以挨過時日的吧？可是，多福的庸人，他們正是没有理想的一天一天地活下去，這就會有頭腦有智識有思想的人，發生難以解答的問題了，要有理想的人生，那就是說你已經騎上虎背，不得不加鞭駕御那虎兒向前跑呵！你旣然不願意庸碌的没有理想的過活，那你就是只有硬着頭皮迎接痛苦奮鬥下去了。人生就是這樣，這樣就是人生。</p>
<p>因讀家書胡思亂想，却給我發見以上的人生哲理。</p>

<h3 id="c275">職業與事業 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 麥夫</p>
<p>一般人每以爲職業就是事業，事業就是職業，這其間没有分别，没有不同，最多不過是一件事物的兩個名詞而已。這種話要是我們的古人說留下來的，却也不失其爲確；可是若就現社會的生存者來說，可就不能没有疵瑕了。</p>
<p>我們知道所謂職業，卽是一個人謀生之業，這業務不是出於自己的心情，而是取决於不可知的社會力量。事業則是一個人的野心，一個人的意慾，一個人想以他的堅强的生命意識，來發揮他　人生　　大　企圖。</p>
<p>假使我們肯細心的夫觀察這當前的社會，起碼會感覺到它並不是我們所需要的社會。因爲這其問充滿了矛盾，充</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>滿了錯誤，充滿了不堪言說的雜亂與顚倒，到處是矛盾與矛盾的對立，從自己的立脚點望過去，無不是面面漆黑。</p>
<p>自然，在這種社會裏，是不容許我們去做願意做的事，處處要挨受社會的阻撓，生活註定了我們一生的活動，不得不分出大半的時間去從事麵包的戰爭，不怕你是個怎樣熱心想獻身給文藝或藝術的人事，但爲了要獵取日常的麵包，你便不能不一面抑制住你的熱心，而一面去找一個不是願意的僅可得到麵包的工作，以養活你的生命。當前的社會，就是這樣不容評事業與職業合而爲一，它不容許你想做一個藝術家，只馮着你的藝術家的身分分你一份麵包。所以我們在這種缺陷的社會裏，不能不把事業和職業分開｜｜事業是一回事，職業又是一回事。</p>
<p>因爲職業不是我們願意的作業，所以爲了要滿足我們心靈的一種慾求｜｜欲以自己的生活動來表達自己對人類社會的一種意志的慾求，我們便非就着自己的個性來活動不可。此方我想成爲一個發明家，或想成爲一個藝術家，或想成爲一個時代的政治樞紐的人物，這科學，藝術的研究，政治的活動，便是我心靈的慾求，便是我意志的表達。而在這種意慾没有完全達到滿足點的時候，就是我的事業没有成功的時候，我們非假藉一種全然不合乎我們心意的事情，來維繫着我們的研究不可。</p>
<p>這種艱苦的奮鬥，就是人類的偉大的精神，也就是我們人性偉大的處所，在我們，是應當激發着這種精谉的發展的。這種精神的激發，就是人類社會的一種促進，也就是一種我們所希冀的社會到臨的預期。</p>
<p>所以無論如何我們要把事業和職業分得開。因爲把事業當做是職業而混淆了，我們就犯了對現社會認識不透的錯誤，結果因爲職業不能符合事業的慾求，便將會不能免的發出人生的苦惱。若是我們把職業當做事業而混淆了，結果便會因職業是種全没有意義的作業，終其一生不過是「徒活」而已，它將會全部掩没着他的心靈，掩没着他的意志，而他的生命意識的活躍，祗不過是無意識一大團。若是我們能分得淸，事業是事業，職業是職業，則對事業當有一個估計，一回凖備和從事奮鬥的决心。而對職業也旣不會覺得是空虛，亦不會覺得它是無聊與没有意義了。</p>

<p>文炳兄眞是個可人兒，他十足道地的談了半天女人，還聲明是外行，你看他一切形容女人的字句那樣自然的描寫出來，我不信一個外行的男子他知道女人如許之多？我新近知道文章的看法有正反面，大槪「理想的女人」就是反面文章了。多寫了幾篇「戀愛的故事」，就有富麗堂煌的高冠送給你。文炳兄，留意着大减價時代的「大贈品」。不過這些都是廢話，不涉本文之内，我想說的是「寫文章無非是爲的七錢三」不是句俏皮話。</p>
<p>我愛好文藝。先父所留給我的一樹破書，我有機會回到鄉下去，一定百忙中檢查牠們曾否被蠹蟲損壞，或者搬到院子中暴矖一番，而我自已所置辦的書藉，除借去後失蹤外佈置一個像受古書店般舊書舖是綽綽有餘：就在現今生活難時代，到上海五年來，也有一大書架的成績了。不過從前是，祗要囊中有錢，不問精華糟粕的搬到家中來；現在看廣告的門檻也精了，錢自然也不像往昔的肯和我做朋友，所以在我小樓中的大槪均在水平綫以上的作品。蔚說我買書像「鳥銜食」，因爲我都是一本一本拖回來的。</p>
<p>自然，到某一個時期嘗試學寫文章了。寫出來的東西都自認是俱屬上乘，於是各報附利的字紙簏内時常有我的傑作駕臨；然而是永不灰心的，能够今天寫，明天寫，早上寫，晚上寫，或者各附刋的編輯先生也有忘戴近視眼鏡的時候，居然是一登龍門，身價十倍，巍巍然以文學家自居了。</p>
<p>但是倒底是「自居」的文學家，他的作品還是大量的產生，學期刋物，學刋壁報，都是少不了他的作品的。</p>
<p>如今是不再是一個經濟寬裕的學生了，也不再是自居的文學家了，踏出校門來。將我脫胎換骨，尤其是五年來的磨礪生活。我不知道什麽，每天醒來的時候牢記着我要吃飯，我妻子要吃飯，我見子也將　　　討飯吃。</p>
<p>這麵亭子同内「作家」，在上海我想也能凑成航空　　　　的數目，如此　文炳兄，作能承認「　文章無非爲的是七錢三」是句俏皮話嗎？夫啊！</p>

<p>「話說是閙笑話嗎？你也不了解我！天喲·連朋友都難開我了！」</p>
<p>他誤會了，或者是我說的話是錯的。但他的話確實是於我如晴天的霹靂。「你誤會了。我是了解你的。我們的人生確是在演的悲劇，可是我們應該用理智來對付我們的命運喲，任情感的奔放，那就只有作了命運的俘虜，有什麽益處呢？」</p>
<p>「然而，政治環境給我五分的刺激，社會環境給我五分的刺激，我已經十足地受不住了，現在愛人又給我一大部分的刺激，呌我的理智有什麽威力可以制勝了呢？我的腦子裏充滿了刺激。，我的血管裏也充滿了刺激，我的一身將給刺激這惡魔擠破了，你就不自殺，也會被那惡魔咬死了的呵！」</p>
<p>「你的愛人這一次給你的刺激，那是你自己招來的。」</p>
<p>「我自己招來的？」他狠狠地失神似地瞠了我一眼。</p>
<p>「是的，我說，是你自己招來的。她曾經對我說過，她知道你是在過着煩悶苦惱的生活，可是你並不告訴她你煩悶苦惱的是爲什麽，她就是要安慰你也不知道那一種話才正是安慰着你的心的話，所以她是在過着憂愁不安的生活。你對於愛人爲什麽也要那麽的驕傲呢？你的煩悶苦惱的心話爲什麽不告訴她，讓她能够說出安慰你的話來呢？她不了解你，而且是你讓她不了解你，她怎麽能够和你一起生活下去呢？」</p>
<p>「她是不滿政治的人呵！我也曾經和她談論過政治，可是她不喜歡聽；她說一聽頭就痛，她是一個極端的享樂主義者呵！我愛她的是，她有着純潔的靈魂，美麗的身體，和辦事的才幹；她厭惡政治又有什麽關係呢？不料，不料却因此而互相痛苦！她不了解政治思想，因此不了解我在政治思想當中所得到的苦惱，而我呢，也不願意她了解政治思想，以致在她的純潔的靈魂上面刻劃些難以消滅和擺脫不了的創痕。這樣，就這樣，好在憂愁不安，我在煩悶苦惱，…原來却是我的錯喲！可是，我也並非不讓她了解我，我是因爲愛她的緣故，不讓她嘗着苦惱之杯喲！而她，而她不了解我的愛意，離開我，走了！唉！」</p>
<p>其後，他到你家裏，你不見他，而且離開上海到遠方去了，你爲什麽連見他都不見呢？現在他更「反常」了，在講壇上對着學生講「文學」却將弗羅培爾（Ｆlaubert）的「菠華荔夫人」那部小說的故事舖張揚厲地在講女人的心理，又將易卜生的「娜𡝰」那篇劇本的故事吹毛求疵地在講女人的性格，其給論是和基督敎徒一樣地敎學生最好不要和女人結婚，戀愛。你看，他是一個禁慾主義者嗎？不是的。他是由於失戀而對女人反動的呵！</p>
<p>他更酗酒啦，一喝起碼五六蘭瓶，不醉不止，一醉那就什麽驚座的牢騷他都口如懸河地直瀉出來，對於政治的不滿，對於社會的仇恨，對於某某人的劣蹟，他都信口大講，他是失去了心的人以呵！</p>

<p>「晚宴」的導演方面　史東山應雲衛</p>
<p>「晚宴」由於八大名星的名單興奮了上海的不少的影迷。和在其他各國一樣，也博得不少好評，似乎是影壇中不可多得的珍寳。正因爲它被人們如此重視，正因爲它有着較高的評價，於是，在懷着極大的希望而去鑒賞的人們，也許將得看某種程度的失望吧。</p>
<p>晚宴的導演，是喬其高卡（Ｇ·Ｇukor），在好萊塢總算是一個頗有聲望的藝人。他的「戰爭與貞操」「名門藝術」，始終留給人們相當深刻的印象。</p>
<p>就藝術的見地來說，那末他的作品自稱圖以至於劇的色澤，都有着他自己的誠就。自聲片完全奪取了影片市塲之後，舊的作家相繼没落，而高卡却自舞臺到銀幕而成爲新藝人中的成就者了。</p>
<p>關於他的作風，一般的說，他的作品非常明朗，同時也具有洒落的Ｓtyle。在某種塲合，類似於Ｗ。德達列的作品。他的作品被一般成年人所愛好，尤其是都市中的智識份子，更容易爲他的作品所感動。反之，愛好湯密格士之流的人們，决不是他的作品之理解者。在他的作品中，很少有Ｓpeedy的Climax，但是他淸泉般流麗的手法，却是十分洗鍊的明快，然亦不流於輕薄。因此，在心情快樂的人們的心中，長留着某種明媚的Ｔouch，横溢着淸快的心情。　　在晚宴中，我們也同樣不會忽視這些優點，卽是說，他那特殊的手法，仍然在明顯的展開。</p>
<p>不過，在「晚宴」中，我們却不能同意他不能掃除舞臺上的手法，將一個戲分成若干段落，雖然用着鐘聲來說明時間的經過，可是總顯時間的交待不淸。事實上就有許多人這不是一天中所發生的事件。</p>
<p>當然，我們並不說因爲他原是舞臺人而原諒他的舞臺技巧，而最主要的是由於旣然驟合了許多大明星，不能不使每一個大明星都有表演之機會。因此，爲了要比較平均的排佈，爲了多量明星表現的地位關係，幾乎形成了游藝會節目式的各個的表演。</p>
<p>再說罷，假使人們認爲這是一個有偉大之意義的，而在藝術觀點上更需要這幾位明星來表演的話，那末我們决不忽視美國片有着偉的精神。然而事實上並不如此，顯然的，乃是企業家爲了來一次最後的掙扎，而企圖以大明星的名字來號召大批的影迷。</p>
<p>製片的動機旣然如此，近視的眼光，旣然僅僅聚視於大量的金元之上，於是我們覺得這精神衰弱症嗎針，未免可笑。而站在藝術的觀點上說，却不能不因之嘆息吧。</p>
<p>的確，在「晚宴」的華貴的宴會之後，揭穿了美國人的虛僞自私，同時更暴露了美國資本主義社會之崩潰，這在我們認識了這决定的意義之後，我們不會忽視劇作者之率直的態度。從美國藝人一貫的粉飾太平的一點來說，這一態度確是相當可取。</p>
<p>「今朝有酒今朝醉！」當紳士淑女之羣走向大餐間的時候，我們聽着這一句可怕的言詞，這在他們已經没落到最後一步的時候，自然這句話是可以使高貴的人們聞之心醉的。但是這對於小有產者之羣，他們一方面感覺没落的可怕，一方面又懂憬着未來的光明，他們將是何種感覺呢？「今朝有酒今朝醉！」這消極的字句，對於我們正是將入墳墓之墓之前的葬歌啊，希望我們力自振作起來。（此文由凌鶴執筆，前段並加己見，註明以明責任。）</p>

<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>電影，無疑的，並不是一種純娛的工具，而銀幕上所有的畫面，直接和間接，都足以影響於觀衆的思想與人生。向來一般的影片公司，唯一的目的，在於營業。一張影片，祗要能够吸引觀衆，所取的材料，是否午鄙齷齪，足以影響於觀衆，公司方面，什麽也不顧的。但現在，有的影片公司，已覺悟到影片的本身，除了供人娛樂之外，更負有帮助敎育，改善人生的重要意義，因而作風已漸漸的改變。最近，各國的影片作風，更有一部分注意到農村的趨向。的確，電影與農村，其中自有密切的關係呢！</p>
<p>美國是一個電影事業的先進國。美片的勢力，在全世界所佔的地位，也最是重要。但我們覺得美國的影片，在過去，有一個重大的弊病，便是十張影片之中，至少有九張是描寫都市生活。歌啊，舞啊，大飯店啊，跳舞塲啊，一切的一切，無非是都市人生的縮影。然而這些墮落的都市生活，搬上了銀幕，於觀衆有害而無益。但最近，美國的影片，有幾家公司已改變了作風。一方面雖並不將描寫都市的生活，完全擯棄，而一方面却注意到多攝農村現狀，農民生活的影片。使影片在銀幕上，放映之時，除了都市的描寫之外，觀衆又可目覩農村的寫實。旣不感單調而乏味，同時，又可使觀衆發生對於農村生活的興趣，增加對於農村現狀的認識。在復興運動中的美國，對於復興農業運動，也在積極進任，那麽要求民衆的同情於復興農業，影片自然是一種重要的帮助，毌怪美國的影片公司，要改途易轍注意於描寫農村現狀的影片呢！</p>
<p>復次，我們再看到蘇俄，實行新經濟政策以後，蘇俄便極力的鼓勵和宣傳，提倡生產事業。鼓勵和宣傳，電影自然是一種最好的工具，而蘇我的利用電影爲宣傳鼓勵的工具，更用另一種方式，另一種手段，和别國不同。而他們所最注意的，便是使電影到農村去。一方面是帶着說敎的性質，而同時，他方面更在灌輸農業知識！說敎的結果，無疑的，在企圖全俄的民衆，都能效忠於蘇維埃政府；而灌輸農業知識的結果，於蘇俄的生產方面，經濟方面，自然可得到好多的收穫。他們所取的方去，一方把農村的現狀，和農村的生活，攝上了銀幕，到都市中去放映，使都市中的人們，對於農村裏的一切，都有深切的認識；而一方把各種新農具的施用，和實施集產化農業區的成績，攝上了影片，利用電影巡迴汽車，到各處農村去放映，直接簡接，都可增進農民們的知識。我們覺得蘇俄的利用電影，以增進農業知識，的確，有好多可取的地方。</p>
<p>最近，在中國，農村破產的呼聲已喊遍了全國。但都市中的人民，還是儘在享福，不知農民的疾苦。電影界自然要負起救濟農村的使命，所以我以爲中國的影片公司，應當多攝一些關於描寫農村實地狀况，農民實際生活的影片使都市中的人們，知道農村是破產了，農民是將要不堪生活了，然而我們檢查過去的事實，一般的影片公司，所攝的影片，描寫農村經濟，農民生活的，却很少。偶然有少數的影片，是以農村爲背境，但也不能把農村的現象，很深刻的描寫出來，其實在資本很薄弱，藝術很幼稚的中國，影片公司，如果多攝一些關於農村寫實的影片，不但較有意義，而因爲有大自然做佈景，演員的衣服，也都是粗草樸素，而非常的經濟。那麽又是有意義，又是很經濟的農村寫實片，我們又爲何不是多攝一些，而儘是拍攝描寫都市生活，畸形社會的影片呢？</p>

<p>— 春雷</p>
<p>上海電影事業之於南洋，和好來塢影業之於上海一樣地是一個銷售的大市塲。但是到了最近却發生了一點小小的變動，原因是上海的影片公司已經有大部份改製有聲影片。此聲片的對白是國語，而南洋的華僑百份之九十九是廣東同胞，他們聽不懂國語，自然他們對於有聲片的興趣便减却了許多了。</p>
<p>於是有一些粤人攝製的片子，便應運而出，像「良心」，「白金龍」「斷腸碑」「泣荆花」，等片，頗能投合。但是這種粤片大多是舊舞臺古典劇的改作，缺乏了實現的形式與内容；而且出品，也不多，供不應求，在這樣情形之下，華僑們便有創立影片公司的動機，經過多方的籌備，在不久以前，在暹邏，成立了一家暹羅聯合影片公司。</p>
<p>上月因事南旋途經香港在中央大戲院看了一部這個公司的處女作「湄江情浪」。</p>
<p>這是一部用純粤語對白的聲片，内容是一段戀愛故事，背境是湄南江岸的幾個華僑男方角：元少得女主角胡君少。港中對之頗有好評。我個人以爲除了收音和攝影頗有相當的成績外，其内容的意識無甚可取。但是旣爲處女作，幼穉一點是可原諒的。而且它是國人在海外經營藝術企業的先聲，其精神更値得嘉許。</p>
<p>這個公司設立於暹京曼谷經理爲李昆林。當它剏立之初卽得當地華僑，敎育界，及暹政府之讚助。它所用的收音機，爲美國西電公司的出品。據說，卽是暹王購助的。</p>

<p>羅其就把泰克絲呌了過來問題：「哈囉，泰克絲，那個儘靠邊上的那個孩子是誰：泰克絲當他和她開玩笑哩，她說：「自從你把她送了過來，我還正在想着哩。不過審判長李琪想奬她一下，送了她一付手鐲，但她竟不要，將手鐲送回去了。亦是一個小傻瓜。你送了她來，你還不知道她的名字嗎？」羅其再對那女孩子仔細地看了一下，忽然想了起來道：「哦……那原來就是瓊蕙蘭。我說怎麽她不像你這個地方的人呢。」泰克絲坐直了，一只手叉在腰上，對着羅其道：「羅其先生，請你顧全些你的名譽。」羅其道：「别名譽不名譽了，這齣表演完了，你將送她到這裏來！」</p>
<p>一回兒那玲瓏活潑的瓊蕙蘭來了。她坐在羅其的身旁，黃澄澄的眼睛，很和氣的對着羅其。她說：「弗蘭克，我都不敢相信了。我們很久没有相見，亦不知有多少年了。」羅其對她笑道：「那末我們喝點兒酒叙叙闊别，好不好？」瓊道：謝謝你，我不喝酒。不過我要見見你，謝謝你對我的一切好處。」羅其將她上下估量了一回，臉上表示歡欣的意思，於是就呌她換換衣服，帶她一同到别處玩去。羅其所說的出去玩，就是出了夜總會的大門，就將　載到他自己佈置得富麗堂皇的公寓裏。那種盜黨所住的公寓，本來是個極危險的地方。要是出了什麽事，是呼呌不應的。并且亦就是專門爲一般上下點頭，而不左右摇頭的女子們而設的。瓊進了羅其的臥室，他在背後就將房門鎖上了。瓊蘭蕙是破題兒第一遭到男子公寓裏，并且這是深夜的時候，所以她雖然說着笑着，心中末免有些喘喘不安。她四週看了一看，屋子裏除掉留聲機，無綫電，酒櫃之外，還有一個雙人大床。</p>
<p>她將大衣脫了下來，下意識地在床上坐着，不知不覺之中將富有曲綫美的腿露了出來。她夾七夾八地講着，她小時候的景况，以及夜總會的一切，連審判長李琪送她手鐲的事都講了出來。羅其在酒櫃上取了幾種酒攙着，摇了兩杯各克泰爾，他問她道：「你不是說你後來將那手鐲還給他了嗎？」瓊蕙蘭道：「當然，我還給他了。」羅共道：「那亦可以。」他將無綫電開了，端了兩杯各克泰爾，走到瓊蕙蘭的身邊，和她一齊坐在床上，身體緊緊地挨着。他將一杯各克泰兒遞給瓊蕙蘭，但是瓊摇着頭說她是向來不吃酒的。羅其說：「祇喝一次不要緊的。這酒亦不兇。」瓊說：「要是你一定要我喝的話。」於是他們碰着杯子，拿酒都喝了。過了一回，羅其又問她還要喝不要喝。道次瓊堅持着不喝了。他們還是緊緊地挨着坐在床上。羅其問道：「那個鐲子，你眞的還了嗎？」瓊蕙蘭道：「那自然，我怎好白拿人家的東西而没有東西報答他呢？」羅其道：「但是你亦受過我的好處，是不是？」（未完）</p>

<p>Met with Lin, Wang, and Others for a Long Time</p>
<p>Reported at the Plenary Session This Morning</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek flew directly from Jian'ou, Fujian, to Nanjing on a Ford plane at 11:00 AM on the 22nd and arrived at the Ming Palace Airfield at 2:30 PM in the afternoon. At 1:00 PM, the Aviation Administration had received a report from Fujian stating that the Chairman would take a Ford plane driven by Smith to Beijing at 11:15 AM today. The director of the Aviation Station, Du Fengzhou, separately notified various agencies. The dignitaries arrived at the airfield one after another, including Wang Zhaoming, Yu Youren, Ye Chucang, Huang Musong, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Lifu, Chen Yi, Shi Ying, Liu Zhi, Cao Haosen, He Yaozu, Chen Bulei, and representatives from the National Government's Judicial Yuan, Control Yuan, Military Affairs Committee, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Military Administration, General Staff Headquarters, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Construction Committee, and the Municipal Government, as well as reporters from various newspapers, totaling more than a thousand people. They prepared welcome banners, and the traffic was heavy, causing congestion. The roads near the airfield were lined with military police, and the airfield was heavily guarded. The Aviation Administration's training aircraft, which were parked in the airfield, flew south to meet them. The National Government's band played music to welcome them. After Chiang's plane arrived, Chiang and his wife got off the plane one after another and shook hands with the welcomers. Chiang wore a black mandarin jacket and a blue wool coat, leather shoes, and held a felt hat, looking radiant. His wife, Ms. Song, wore a leather cheongsam and a black sable hat. She left the airfield first in car number 314 at 2:30 PM. Ten minutes later, Chiang and the son of Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi entered car number 315 and returned to the military academy's private residence to rest. At that time, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, Secretary Ye of the Standing Committee, Director Shao of the Central Propaganda Committee, Central Committee member Chen Lifu, and Navy Chief Chen Shaokuan took cars and went together. After a brief conversation, Wang, Sun, Ye, and Chen left one after another, but Shao Yuanchong and Chen Shaokuan stayed to talk the longest. At 4:15 PM, Chiang left his residence and went to the official residence of the Ministry of Railways to meet with Premier Wang to discuss important issues of the Fourth Plenary Session. Later, Education Minister Wang Shijie and Vice Minister Qian Changzhao went to visit, but Chiang was not there and they did not meet. It was heard that Chiang did not leave Wang until 5:30 PM and then went to visit Chairman Lin. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek visited Chairman Lin at 4:00 PM on the 22nd for half an hour. Lin gave much comfort to Chiang's achievements in suppressing the communists and pacifying the rebellion. Chiang then visited Wang and had a very pleasant conversation about the opening of the Plenary Session and the recent political situation in the Central Government. He returned to his official residence at 6:00 PM to rest. At 8:00 PM, he attended the Presidium meeting. In addition to attending the Plenary Session, Chiang Kai-shek will also consult with the Central Government on the follow-up arrangements in Fujian Province, the conflict between Sun and Ma, and the whereabouts of Zhang Xueliang. (Central News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The Aviation Administration received a telegram from Chairman Chiang on the night of the 20th, and on the morning of the 21st, it dispatched personnel to drive the Ford plane parked at the Kuangqiao Airfield to the front to meet him. At 8:00 AM, those who welcomed him out of the airfield included Zhou Junyan, Director of the Department of Finance, Lü Bishou, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Wang Chengying of the Provincial Committee, Jiang Guotao, Chief of the Staff Office of the Garrison Headquarters, Xiao Qian, Commander of the 11th Division, Zhao Zhiyou, Mayor of Hangzhou, and many others. As of 3:00 PM, Chiang had not yet arrived.

<h3 id="e15">Chairman Chiang's Command of the Suppression of the Rebellion <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The Rebel Army No Longer Has the Ability to Fight</p>
<p>The Destruction of the Jiangxi Bandits is Imminent</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain important person around Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the reporter of the Central News Agency, the military progress of the suppression of the rebellion under the personal command of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at the front was exceptionally rapid. The Fujian rebels have been completely eliminated. After our army recovered Fujian, the elite of the rebel troops were almost completely lost. It is estimated that two regiments were lost in Yanping, three regiments were lost in Shuikou, two regiments were lost in Gutian, and two regiments were lost when intercepted by our army while crossing the Minjiang River. Two or three regiments were also lost in Putian. The remaining troops are only a few thousand people. When we recovered Fuzhou, the rebel army fled in a hurry, and all the supplies in Fujian were seized by our army. In the battle of Putian, the two units of the rebels, Qu Shounian and Mao Weishou, were seriously injured. Qu and Mao were both captured. The Chairman then released them, ordering them to lead their troops to return and atone for their sins. Now Zhangzhou has been captured. The remnants of the rebel troops no longer have the ability to fight. The rebels' connection with the Red Bandits has also been cut off by our army and there is no way to go. The rebels are now in the Quanzhou area. Two days ago, we sent planes to the front to distribute leaflets, informing the rebel army to revolt. The fact that the four division commanders, including Shen Guanghan, telegraphed to break away from the pseudo-government, or they were enlightened by this. The situation in Fujian is about to be settled. After the rebels and bandits signed an agreement on November 8, the rebels tried to attack with all their strength, but they were defeated by our army. Now the military affairs of suppressing bandits are very confident, and the situation has changed. All fronts have reported victories, and after the chaos in Fujian is calmed, Chiang Dingwen will be appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Western Route Army, and troops will be sent from Fujian to attack.</p>
<p>The destruction of the Jiangxi bandits can be achieved immediately. As for the conflict between Sun Dianying's troops and Ma Hongkui's troops in Ningxia, the Chairman telegraphed Sun's army to stop advancing and return to its original defense. There has been no reply yet. As for Zhang Xueliang's whereabouts, it must be decided after Zhang comes to Beijing and Chiang Kai-shek obtains his personal consent. The Chairman will attend the Fourth Plenary Session this time, and he has no personal proposals. The Chairman is a member of the Central Standing Committee, and if he has any opinions, he will discuss them with other members of the Standing Committee and all members at any time. The Chairman only returned to Beijing today, and it is still difficult to decide when he will leave Beijing. (Central News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e20">A Cautious View on Araki's Resignation <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Minister of War Araki Sadao suddenly submitted his resignation today. According to the Dongdian report, the reason for his resignation is that his illness has not yet healed and he is unable to attend the Diet. However, he, the darling of the era who sways Japanese politics and the representative of the young and vigorous faction of the military, suddenly resigned when the Diet was officially reopened. It cannot be said that this is not a major upheaval in the current Japanese political world.</p>
<p>Araki was a student of the ninth class of the Japanese Army University, and he and the former Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Masaki Jinzaburo, were known as the "Twin Gems of the Army." He had studied in Russia and served as the head of the special agency in Manchuria. When he was the commander of the 6th Division, he gradually emerged and was respected by the young and vigorous military officers. When Inukai organized a single cabinet in 1931, the September 18th Incident suddenly occurred, and the situation in East Asia became tense, and Sino-Japanese relations deteriorated. The general young and vigorous warlords in Japan vigorously advocated their so-called "extraordinary period." Therefore, Araki, through the recommendation of Minami Jiro, went from being the Director of the Education General Headquarters to becoming the Minister of War. After taking office, he did his best to exert his ruthless skills of military aggression. Starting with the Shenyang Incident, followed by the invasion of Jinzhou, the seizure of Rehe, and the threat to Tianjin, Japan's military actions can be said to be smooth.</p>
<p>However, the internal situation in Japan, after the so-called extraordinary period was sung to the clouds, and then the promotion of "Spiritual Japan, Divine Nation Japan," has led to the general Japanese people being in deep water and dire straits. Economic life has become increasingly difficult, and even the so-called spiritual life has become decadent. The depravity of capitalism has been exposed one by one. The hope of nationalism is nothing but illusion. The result of conquering cities and seizing land is only that the people increase the burden of taxes. Therefore, the opposition between the military and the chaebol is becoming increasingly acute. Extreme right-wing thought and left-leaning thought are both growing secretly and spreading among the Japanese people at all levels. Moreover, external economic competition has aroused the resentment of various countries in the world, and diplomacy has become increasingly isolated. Seeing the daily decline of national affairs and the danger of the future, the Minsei and Seiyu parties changed their previous docile attitude at the time of the opening of the Diet and will have a fierce battle with the warlords in the meeting. In the future, the opposition between the Diet and the warlords will become even more intense. Although Araki is mediocre, under this situation, he cannot but think about how to avoid it. This is why he submitted his resignation. After Araki's resignation, the candidates for successor are none other than the current Director of Education, Hayashi Senjuro, and the Military Councilor, Masaki Jinzaburo. Both of these people belong to the Army University faction. Although their policies differ in terms of urgency, there is actually not much difference. The traditional policy of the Japanese warlords is a war every ten years. Any military officer who succeeds will not make any changes. Therefore, under this situation, it can be predicted that the Diet after Araki's resignation will have two different tendencies. First, the lifelessness of parliamentary politics is even more serious in Japan than in European countries. Therefore, the Seiyukai, which has an absolute majority of nearly 300 seats, does not dare to form a cabinet alone. Now that Araki has retired, the young and vigorous officers are still afraid that they will inevitably rise up and directly fight back. Can the form of parliamentary politics continue to be maintained temporarily? Or will the fascist regime follow in the footsteps of the Saito cabinet? Second, the Japanese chaebol has a concrete organization of modern capitalism, and it is clear that they do not want to be manipulated by the military. They are especially opposed to provoking war. Will they take the opportunity of Araki's resignation to break through the difficulties of the extraordinary period and restore the reality of chaebol dictatorship? Or will it become more and more difficult? These are all beyond our ability to predict. However, the fact that Japan is outwardly strong and inwardly weak is known not only to those who study the real situation in Japan, but also to the enlightened members of the Diet in that country. If this continues, it will not be a blessing for the Japanese people. When Araki was in charge of the military and political affairs, there was no way to change it. Now that Araki has left, if there is an opportunity to make the madness of militarism a little calmer, it may not be a turning point in Japan's current crisis.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Sun's Army Heads Straight for Woye <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Two Brigades Fiercely Attack Pingluo County</p>
<p>Ningxia Troops Retreating Towards Hexi</p>
<p>Yan Xishan Sends Representatives to Advise Sun to Halt His Westward Advance</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Sun's army crossed Dengkou, considering Shizuizi a natural and insurmountable barrier on the Ningxia border, they decided it would be difficult to break through. Therefore, they left a small number of troops at Shizuizi to confront Ma's forces. The main force, however, crossed the river from Dengkou, heading directly for Woye. Ma's forces had previously sent a brigade to defend the northern part of Woye, attempting to block Sun's southward advance. However, when Sun's army arrived, due to the overwhelming difference in numbers, Ma's troops on the east bank were unable to withstand the assault and retreated to the west bank of the river, confronting Sun's forces in the area west of Pingluo County. As of now, Sun's follow-up troops are also continuously concentrating in Woye. At the front, the cavalry under the command of Yu Shiming is patrolling along both banks of the Yellow River. Sun has now sent telegrams to He and Huang, requesting them to forward a telegram to the central government, urging the dispatch of high-ranking officials to thoroughly investigate the Rong (military) leaders. The content is similar to the telegram he sent to Wang Shiping yesterday. Wang Shiping will visit He and Huang tonight to seek instructions on everything and will also forward Sun's telegram. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui, in a telegram to He Yingqin on the 20th, stated that according to a telegram from Ma Baolin, the brigade commander in Pingluo, at noon on the 20th, the enemy besieging the city consisted of about two brigades of infantry, cavalry, and artillery. They were based in various villages outside the city, and artillery fire had been incessant since 6:00 AM. Infantry were currently concentrating their bombardment on the Yu Huang Ge (Jade Emperor Pavilion) North Gate tower. Furthermore, according to a supplementary telegram on the 20th, the enemy had increased the number of artillery pieces by twenty. Cavalry surrounded our southern front. Artillery fire had been incessant from dawn until now. Ma, a company commander, died bravely in battle, and over ten soldiers were injured. The enemy also suffered many casualties from our counter-attacks. The majority of the enemy is now concentrated near Pingluo, preparing for a fierce attack. Our officers and soldiers are calmly responding to the situation. The enemy, Yu Shiming, is currently in the Tongji and Tongyi area, confronting our garrison troops stationed at Tongchang, Zhangliang, and Qingshui forts. The bandit troops of Yang Hou are causing disturbances in the Dawakou area. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's troops are still actively advancing westward. As a result of Sun's repeated expansions, his forces now consist of three cavalry divisions, two brigades, three infantry divisions, and various special service regiments, numbering over 60,000 men. Added to this are the newly incorporated bandit groups of Yang Hou and Wang Ying, who have been entrenched in the border regions of the three provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Ningxia for many years. Being familiar with the terrain, they are causing trouble from east to west, leaving the Ningxia troops exhausted from dealing with them. The Ping authorities, because Sun's troops are under the jurisdiction of the Military Affairs Commission, can only telegraphically request him to stop his advance. However, since Ningxia is under the jurisdiction of the Pacification Commissioner of the three provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, they are only reporting the true facts of the incident to the central government and are refraining from expressing their own attitude. The central government is currently busy with the Fourth Plenary Session, and a concrete decision will not be made until Chiang arrives in Nanjing. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Shiping visited He and Huang this morning to inquire about the date of disbursement of the allowance. Both He and Huang replied that the allowance issue arose because no one was responsible in Ping when Wang was in Shanghai. Now that Wang has returned to Ping, it will naturally be provided. As for the "punitive expedition order," that is inaccurate. After Wang took his leave, he immediately telegraphed Sun Dianying about He and Huang's reply. He also sent Han Zili, the director of the army's office, to the Military Affairs Commission in the afternoon to collect the allowance of 90,000 yuan. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bai Jianmin, the representative of Ma Hongkui stationed in Ping, visited He Yingqin this afternoon to make a report. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is reported that Yan Xishan recently sent Liang Zhenhua, the adjutant of the 70th Division, to the Dengkou and Shizuishan area to visit Sun Dianying and advise him to stop his westward advance. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Hou Cheng, awaiting Sun's and Ma's replies regarding assistance with ceasefire methods, has already telegraphed He reporting on his visit to Yan. He plans to return to Ping in a few days, as Yan has already telegraphed Sun and Ma to discuss the matter. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Lu Yuting, Sun Dianying's representative stationed in Nanjing, said that the central government has formulated a peaceful resolution to the Sun-Ma conflict. After a decision is made, high-ranking officials will be sent to investigate the facts and handle the situation accordingly. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zuoyi, the Chairman of Suiyuan, sent his staff officer Mao Jizhai to Ping on the evening of the 21st to visit He Yingqin and report on the westward advance of Sun Dianying's troops. According to Mao, who spoke to reporters on the 22nd, Sun's army is advancing westward towards Woye in two routes. The main force departed from Dengkou, while a smaller force headed directly for Woye, seemingly intending to directly attack Ningxia. This is because the Yellow River is frozen, making military movement easier. Currently, the Ningxia garrison has shortened its defensive line and is resisting with all its might. He was ordered by Chairman Fu to come to Ping to visit Chairman He and report on the westward advance of Sun's army to Suiyuan. He will stay for two or three days before returning to Suiyuan.

After receiving the telegram, Shibayama went to Jurentang to visit He Yingqin and requested that he quickly order the increased garrison along the Great Wall to withdraw. He then summoned Qin Dechun for consultation. Qin stated that the Chahar provincial authorities had never transferred troops to the Great Wall line and requested that He refute the claim. He and Huang, considering that there were many future problems in eastern Chahar, telegraphed Song Zheyuan to come to Beiping for consultation with the Japanese representative. Song is planning to come to Beiping tonight or tomorrow morning. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Shisun went to Tianjin this afternoon to visit Song. He said that regarding the Chahar East incident, he was assigned to negotiate with the Japanese Embassy's military attaché, Nemoto. The Japanese army has already withdrawn. Currently, an agreement has been made with the Japanese side to negotiate in Beiping. Huang specially summoned Song back to Beiping to find a proper solution to the Chahar East situation. The Japanese representative has not yet been appointed. Song will return to Chahar after the negotiations have reached a certain stage. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Fu Chun's troops have been reorganized into a regiment and placed under the control of Zhang Zizhong's division. The Chicheng, Dushikou, Longmensuo, and Zhaojiaying areas in eastern Chahar are still garrisoned by Zhang Renjie and Zhang Yunrong's troops, with no increase in troops. The Japanese side's excuse is obviously pre-meditated. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic sources say that the Chahar East incident has been completely resolved through negotiations between the Ping Political Affairs Commission, the Military Affairs Commission, and the Japanese side. The Japanese and puppet troops who attacked Longmensuo have now withdrawn. However, the military and political authorities in North China believe that the Japanese army is deliberately misinterpreting the Tanggu Truce Agreement and is using bandit suppression as a pretext to encroach upon us. If this continues, the future is worrisome. It is reported that the central government has been informed in detail and has been asked to provide a post-settlement policy and that the plenary session should conduct a thorough discussion of the diplomatic problems of North China and provide guidance for compliance.

<p>Requesting Adoption of the Original Autonomy Outline</p>
<p>Declaring that They Cannot Accept the Measures Determined by the Political Council</p>

Chairman Lin extended his encouragement to the representatives and inquired about the current situation in Inner Mongolia in great detail. The representatives expressed the desire of Inner Mongolia for autonomy and requested the adoption of the original autonomy outline. Lin replied that if it did not conflict with the principles of autonomy determined by the central government, it could be adopted. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Representatives from Mongolia requesting autonomy in Nanjing issued a statement, which read: "Regarding the solemn declaration, the representatives learned on the afternoon of January 16 of the results of the Central Political Council's Legislative Group's re-examination of the Mongolian autonomy case. The eleven articles agreed upon by Minister Huang in Bailingmiao were completely changed. Alarmed, we could not sleep all night. January 17 was the date of the Central Political Council meeting. At 7:00 AM, we met with representatives of various leagues and banners stationed in Nanjing and presented a document to the Central Political Council requesting the maintenance of the original plan agreed upon in Bailingmiao. We also presented the photocopied petition to each member of the council as they arrived, requesting their support. When the Central Political Council sent Secretary-General Tang to meet us, we verbally explained the situation in detail, urging the maintenance of the original plan and, at the very least, requesting that room be left for maneuver. We were promised that it would be relayed, and we were strongly urged to return first. At noon, we returned to our residence to await orders. Unexpectedly, the Central Political Council still made a decision based on the results of the review that day. The decision was published in the newspapers on the 18th. After carefully reading it several times, we were shocked. The Central Political Council's decision also consisted of eleven articles, but they were completely opposite to the eleven articles agreed upon in Bailingmiao. The representatives were sent to Nanjing to request the early implementation of the original plan agreed upon in Bailingmiao and to thank the central government for its good intentions. Now that the Central Political Council's decision is completely contrary to the original plan, the representatives absolutely dare not accept it. In addition to separately listing the parts of the Central Political Council's decision that are not suitable for the Mongolian people and reporting the above situation to the government while informing officials and civilians of each league and banner, we hereby solemnly declare that we absolutely cannot accept the eleven articles of the Mongolian autonomy plan decided by the Central Political Council on January 17. We hope that our compatriots will grant us their understanding." (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

After Chairman Ju Zheng of the Standing Committee led the ceremony, Dai Chuanxian of the Central Committee gave a report, stating that the orderly participation of comrades in the opening ceremony of the plenary session the day before was unprecedented, demonstrating sincere unity. The difficulties encountered by the Party and the country over the past year have reached their peak. The hope for the future lies only in the efforts of the comrades. The Fujian Incident is most disheartening to us. As the saying goes, "People fear heartbreak, and trees fear being peeled." Because past rebellions were all caused by counter-revolutionaries, this time, the Fujian Incident was caused by a member of the Central Committee of our Party, and the rebel army was the 19th Route Army, which was praised throughout the country, attempting to shake the foundation of our Party. However, the will of the entire country is unified and extremely calm, and it is deeply aware of the danger this move poses to the nation and the people. The comrades also feel a great sense of responsibility. Therefore, the Fujian Incident was largely quelled in less than two months, thanks to everyone's spirit of loving the Party and the country. The responsibility of our Party in the future is to act on our words, to gather ideas and benefit from them, and to follow the eight characters. There are already many guidelines left by the Premier and decisions made in past meetings. In the future, we must reorganize them once again and strive to implement them to save the country. The duty of everyone lies in the place where our spirit resides. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Vienna – Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich's three-day stay here has concluded. He issued a declaration stating that during these days, he discussed general political situations and various fundamental issues related to Italy and Austria with Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, other cabinet members, and important leaders from all sectors. Regarding economic aspects, such as how to utilize the Adriatic Sea for the benefit of both countries' commerce, the discussions were very sincere. They also reached a full agreement on maintaining Austria's complete independence and reorganizing and developing Austria's economic system. Simultaneously, the Austrian government's information agency also released the aforementioned remarks by Suvich, stating that Suvich's visit once again confirmed Italy's goodwill towards the Austrian people. It also demonstrates that Austria's position in Central Europe, especially its location in the Danube River basin, is more significant than its land size or population. However, if Austria is to fulfill its national mission and satisfy all countries, it needs stability, independence, and inviolability. Italy has held this view for a long time. Now, Italy has proposed suggestions regarding the construction work of countries in the Danube basin. If accepted, Austria's economic position will receive a new stimulus. Encouragingly, Austrian authorities are striving towards this path, so the development of Austria's future, both economically and politically, is undoubtedly promising. (21st National Telegram)</p>

<p>Symbols of Germany's Unity, Past and Present</p>
<p>Papen's Speech Responds to Daladier</p>
<p>Cottbus – German Vice-Chancellor Papen, taking the opportunity of the Nazi Party and the Steel Helmet League holding celebrations here for the 63rd anniversary of the founding of the German Empire, delivered a speech responding to French Premier Daladier's remarks in the Senate last week. His words were in sharp opposition to Daladier, stating that anyone who remembers the jubilation of the German people in 1871 when Bismarck created the Second German Empire will also remember that Germany today, as in the past, feels that it has entered the gateway to a new era of development. In the past, the symbol of German unity was the imperial crown; today, it is the swastika. Germans look to the future, feeling that the symbols of the imperial crown and the swastika embody the same ideology, namely that the duty of the German people is to fulfill their mission to the world and Western culture. This great national unity has united the German states, provinces, counties, towns, villages, all occupations, all ages, and all classes of society, rich and poor, wise and foolish, into one body. The breadth of its scope and the firmness of its unity are unprecedented. The German people are not troubled by the difficulties of their current position. Germany does not want to pursue imperialist policies, nor does it want to attack anyone, but insists on having a corresponding position among sovereign nations. This is not the kind of ideology that Daladier referred to in the Senate on January 18 as inciting various national sentiments, but merely the ideology of a great nation having the right to a glorious existence.

<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai and Minseito parties held separate conventions on the 21st due to the official opening of Parliament on the 23rd, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Seiyukai President Suzuki gave a speech advocating that "politics, national defense, and diplomacy must be based on the general will of the people, i.e., constitutional politics," and refuted the theory of eliminating external political parties. Minseito President Wakatsuki said in his speech, "There are people in the political world who advocate dictatorship, and we absolutely oppose this claim." The two parties had not dared to advocate strong opinions in the past because of the loss of credibility of political parties, but recently the atmosphere of rejecting political parties has eased somewhat, so they both strongly advocate the establishment of a parliamentary system, and their attitude towards the military has also changed slightly from the past. It can be discerned how the two parties will respond to the upcoming Parliament. (22nd Japan Federation News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Once擅自率 a Section of the Korean Army</p>
<p>Crossed the Yalu River to Invade Our Northeast</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Araki resigned due to illness. The new Minister of the Army who will shoulder the heavy responsibility of Japan's national defense in an emergency is General Hayashi Senjuro, who is of the third rank and the first class of the Order of the Rising Sun, fourth grade. He was born in February of Meiji 9 and is the eldest son of Hayashi Jijiro, a samurai of Ishikawa Prefecture. In Meiji 29, he graduated from the Military Academy, and in Meiji 30, he was appointed Second Lieutenant of Infantry. He and Military Councilor General Watanabe Kotaro were classmates in the same class, one class earlier than Generals Masaki, Honjo, Abe, Araki, and Matsui. In Meiji 36, he graduated from the Army Staff College. In Taisho 5, he rose to Lieutenant General of the Army, during which time he served as a member of the General Staff Headquarters, attached to the Korean Garrison Headquarters, commander of the 58th Infantry Regiment, attached to the Army Technical Headquarters, commander of the Military Academy, attached to the Inspector General of Military Education, commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, commander of the Tokyo Fortress, and president of the Army Staff College. He also served as commander of the Imperial Guard Division and commander of the Korean Army. In Showa 7, he was promoted to General of the Army and served as Inspector General of Military Education and Military Councilor. During the Manchurian Incident, he unilaterally decided to cross the Yalu River with a section of the Korean Army and enter Manchuria, and all sides praised this achievement. Therefore, Hayashi's succession as Minister of the Army is considered the most suitable choice. (22nd Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When Hayashi was serving as commander of the Korean Army, there was already talk of him being a candidate for Minister of the Army. He is known for his high character, calmness, practicality, and courage to be decisive. He has a good reputation for concentrating the expectations of the Army in his person. He was once a military commissioner of the League of Nations and had been stationed in France for many years. (22nd Japan Federation News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Yasukawa Yunosuke, the director-general of Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd., the king of the Japanese financial world, has decided to resign due to the expiration of his term. The director class of the Mitsui affiliated companies will therefore undergo a reorganization, and its scope seems to reach a considerable extent. The chairman of the Hounkai Foundation, which is currently applying for accreditation, will be taken over by Yoneyama Umeji, the current president of Mitsui Trust. However, Yoneyama is a leading figure in the Japanese trust company world, and his resignation will inevitably have a major impact on the financial world. Therefore, according to observers, Yoneyama seems to be temporarily holding his current position concurrently. Yasukawa is also resigning as the managing director of Mitsui Gomei Kaisha, and Nanjo Kinie will take over his position. Mitsui Bank will hold a shareholders meeting on March 1, and Kikumoto Naotsujiro will take office as chairman of the board of directors.

<p>Maintaining the Non-Recognition Doctrine</p>
<p>No Need to Issue Another Declaration</p>
<p>(Washington) Senior government officials view Puyi's declaration of himself as emperor as having no other significance than to show the world that "Manchukuo" has achieved autonomy. This point was clarified by government officials in a conversation with journalists today. It is said that the so-called accession of Puyi to the throne has no important significance because the situation has not fundamentally changed. Moreover, this kind of evolution from the position of regent to monarch is not enough to have any direct impact on Japanese-Russian relations, which the United States is deeply concerned about. It is said that the official attitude of the United States has not changed in any way, that is, maintaining the non-recognition doctrine. As for whether the government will issue a declaration reaffirming this position, officials have not indicated anything, but said that President Roosevelt believes that it is useless to restate the universally recognized policy at this time. Political circles believe that a corner of Asia "contains explosives" and can explode at any time, but Puyi's usurpation of the throne is not enough to be the fuse. (20th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Says Not a Single Soldier Has Been Sent to the Border</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, there have been widespread rumors in the Soviet Union about the crisis of war between Japan and Russia, and figures such as the French political heavyweight Herriot have continued to spread rumors about the cloud of war in the Far East. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs specifically issued a statement on the 22nd to refute these rumors. At the same time, it clarified the fundamental policy of Japanese diplomacy, saying that Soviet government officials, People's Commissar Council Chairman Molotov, Foreign Affairs People's Commissar Litvinov, Red Army Military Revolutionary Committee General Budyonny, etc., have been giving speeches at the Central Executive Committee since last year, pointing out that Japan is preparing for war and stating that Japan is plotting to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway. On the other hand, public speeches by former French Prime Minister Herriot and US Ambassador to Russia Bullitt also stated that war between Japan and Russia was imminent. The Japanese government has maintained a calm attitude towards the Soviet Union's repeated challenging attitude. In the past, when the Soviet Union issued documents, it also used a calm attitude to correct its reflections. It has always sought to resolve various pending issues between Japan and Russia by peaceful means. That is, in the negotiations for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Japan actively mediated. When the Soviet Union某结 stationed troops on the Russian-Manchurian border, Japan, because it was responsible for joint defense under the Japan-Manchukuo Treaty, did not send a single soldier to the border area. The Japanese government's attitude is so determined, but the Soviet Union has recently continued to make challenging remarks. Japan finds it difficult to understand the reasons for this. If the Soviet Union continues this attitude, the result will not only create an atmosphere of unease between the two countries, but also cause third-country aircraft to be used to create a crisis between Japan and Russia.

After the examination is completed, a Military System Investigation Committee will be established in May to deliberate on the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol, the standing army strength of the Army to cope with the future international situation, and the improvement of equipment systems. In this investigation committee, the issue of deciding on the Army's temporary expenses increased due to the Manchurian Incident as permanent operating expenses will also be studied. When the Ministry of Finance prepares the budget for Showa 10 in the future, it should consider this expanded financial plan, so it is hoped that the Army will decide on a permanent international policy as soon as possible.

<p>Tensions Between the US, Russia, and Japan Intensify</p>
<p>Only Willing to Offer Well-Intentioned Mediation</p>
<p>(Paris) Former Prime Minister and current Chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee Herriot has recently written an article entitled "The Tripartite Balance of Power," which will be published by the Economic and Financial News Agency on Sunday. The so-called "Tripartite Balance of Power" in the article refers to the three major powers of Russia, the United States, and Japan. The conflict between these three major powers is gradually becoming tense, which is a cause of concern for the world. Herriot first mentions the important speech on the Far East issue recently given by Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Soviet Central Executive Committee. Herriot analyzes the key to the Far East issue based on this declaration by Litvinov.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Disputes over the Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>He roughly states that since Japan waged war in Manchuria and created "Manchukuo," the Soviet Union has become alarmed about its interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Soviet Union then held preliminary negotiations with Japan on purchasing the Chinese Eastern Railway. According to Soviet observations, Japan is engaging in military preparations on the Manchurian border. Therefore, the Russian government has no choice but to set up fortifications and increase defenses on the border. Herriot believes that whether or not the negotiations for the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway can be successfully concluded is the key to peace and war. Herriot continues to analyze Litvinov's speech, saying that Litvinov declared in the conclusion that the Soviet Union is determined not to allow an inch of territory to be ceded to others. Therefore, the Soviet Union will continue to increase its land, sea, and air military equipment. Later, during a period of repeated disputes, the Soviet Union reconciled with the United States, and the United States and Russia resumed diplomatic relations, and the situation in the Far East changed again. However, the management of the Chinese Eastern Railway still caused frequent troubles. Both Russia and Japan</p>
<p>Both parties are greatly disturbed and uneasy. Whenever a dispute arises, both parties seize the opportunity to use it as an excuse to attack each other.</p>

<p>(Omitted)... On the Japanese side, they are also paying close attention to the policies of the United States, especially the naval armaments of the United States. From this point of view, there is no doubt that the situation between Japan and the United States, and between Japan and the Soviet Union, is tense. This situation cannot be said to be without danger. Japan needs territory to accommodate its surplus population and needs markets to sell its exports. Japan's needs make some major powers regard it as a hidden concern. At the same time, some parties in Japan are loudly advocating militarism. All of these factors have created a difficult situation. In addition, the naval issue between Japan and the United States and the Chinese Eastern Railway issue between Japan and Russia have made the widespread and long-standing Far East issue even more acute.</p>

<p>MacDonald Cabinet Members Vacillate</p>
<p>Mostly Inclined to Contact the United States</p>
<p>(Washington) According to Washington's observers studying the situation in the Far East, British policy toward Japan may have a major decision at the British Empire Naval Conference that opens on Thursday in Singapore. Although London officials are unwilling to express the significance of this conference, informed sources here recognize this as the first Imperial naval gathering in the Far East in five years, and attach special importance to it at the same time as the new global naval competition. Although the British government, due to economic relations, has decided not to proceed with the construction of the Singapore naval base, reliable sources in London reveal that the naval base will still need to be completed by the end of 1938 or early 1939. This can be seen as an expression of unease from London, Australia, and New Zealand about Japan's ambitions. However, according to other sources, the British government still wants to improve British-Japanese relations, believing that this is the only key to guaranteeing peace in the Pacific. It is said that naval experts in London even believe that the fighting strength of the Japanese Navy is stronger than that of the US Navy. It is said that most members of the MacDonald Cabinet are inclined towards the United States on the Far East issue, but on the one hand, they are still unwilling to offend Japan. The British naval generals attending the Singapore Conference are the Commander-in-Chief of the China Fleet, the Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Fleet, and key personnel from Australia and New Zealand. The status of Japanese naval ports after Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations takes effect will be an important issue, because Japan is still unwilling to hand over the Pacific Trust Territory.

We must solemnly refute such unfounded claims. France has consistently stated that it respects all international agreements it has signed, such as the Treaty of Versailles and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. However, France rejects all ambiguous actions and malicious interference. France deeply respects the three major powers of Japan, the United States, and Russia, who are in dispute in the Far East. France is constantly acting as a mediator in good faith between the three major powers to maintain peace in the Far East, as peace is of the utmost importance to France. France has strived for peace in other regions and will do the same in the Far East. (Havas dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e66">The Naval Situation of the Powers (1) <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>(Foreign Affairs Review Agency) The New Year's special edition of the Japanese magazine "Diplomatic Times" states:</p>
<p>1.  The Relationship Between Land, Sea, and Air Forces</p>
<p>Generally, those who observe the future need to thoroughly study the past and the present. Mahan, based on historical research, derived various lessons for the future. Colonel Maas, the current Director of War Plans for the US Navy, stated, "The prediction of the future should be based on past actions and current situations. In dealing with future matters, our guiding principle is nothing more than the measures that constitute the basis for prediction."</p>
<p>Therefore, to understand the future naval situation of the powers, we must start by examining the past situation.</p>
<p>Armaments exist to support the implementation of national policy. Conflicts of national policy will inevitably lead to the opposition of armaments. If armaments include land and sea forces, countries with deeper connections to the land will prioritize the army, while countries with deeper connections to the ocean will prioritize the navy. However, all major countries in the world are related to the ocean to varying degrees, and none can afford not to maintain naval power. The main ones are the five countries of Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan.</p>
<p>The ocean connects all countries, and therefore, the navy that floats on the sea also has a universal character. The above five countries all have naval interests, and those countries that are directly adjacent have particularly deep relationships. For example, although land power occupies an important position in France and Germany, which are neighboring countries, naval power is also quite important. Furthermore, the naval relationship between Japan and the United States is even more important. In short, the five major naval powers are not only opposed to each other in the world but also confront other smaller naval powers locally.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the development of aircraft, the division between land and sea forces has undergone tremendous changes. On November 3 of last year, the British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated, "As a result of the development of the air force, Britain cannot act as an island and adopt an isolationist policy." Purely maritime countries originally relied on the navy to ensure national defense, but now, as a result of the development of aircraft, they are also afraid of the threat posed by the air power of other countries. Therefore, those who discuss the navy must also discuss the air force.</p>
<p>Will the Washington and London Treaties, which Japan is dissatisfied with, be revised, remain effective, or be abandoned in 1935? A naval disarmament conference will be held to discuss this issue. The outcome of the conference will have a significant impact on the world's naval situation. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the issue of disarmament.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to explore the naval situation of the powers after 1936 and to deduce their mutual relations and the lessons for Japan's national defense based on the national policies and naval power of the five major naval powers. (To be continued)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) At the Legislative Yuan's memorial week on the 22nd, President Sun chaired the meeting. Wu Jingxiong reported on the constitution drafting process, stating that on January 20 of last year, the president appointed 36 members to the Constitution Drafting Committee. Over the past year, the committee members and staff have worked diligently to draft the constitution. His personal feelings are: (1) The chairman of each meeting has an open-minded, fair, and impartial attitude, and each member can fully express their opinions. For example, last week, the discussion on the National Assembly charter took three hours to pass only one article, which shows the spirit. (2) During the debate at the meeting, the committee members argued like enemies, but after the meeting, they were still friends, and their loyalty to serving the country can also be seen. (3) The national system stipulated in the future constitution must be the Three Principles of the People Republic. Civil war is the greatest obstacle to the implementation of constitutional government. For politics to get on track, a strong central government is needed. The colleagues of the Constitutional Draft Committee should continue to bury themselves in hard work to produce a perfect constitution that meets the needs of the times.

<p>The following is also a list of Japanese officials in the various departments of the puppet state's administrative organs - including the Departments of Civil Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Military Affairs, Finance, Industry, Transportation, Judiciary, and Education. The Departments of Finance and Transportation have the largest number of officials. Of course, the center of a country, even a puppet state, is the economy. Japan wants to make the puppet state a second Korea, so it is naturally imperative to control its economy. The percentage of Japanese officials is highest in the Finance Department, showing one aspect of Japan's meticulous planning. The second highest is the Transportation Department, since transportation is the lifeblood of a country, facilitating the flow of economic resources in peacetime and serving as a vital artery in wartime. In the Education Department, the percentage of Japanese officials is also considerable. Cultural aggression has always been the most wonderful and permanent strategy used by invading countries in colonies. In addition, the Departments of Industry and Foreign Affairs also have percentages between 32% and 36%, which is clear evidence of monopolizing foreign affairs and manipulating industry. Only the Judiciary has a small number of officials, with the lowest percentage, at only 19%. This puppet state cannot be considered to have a real judiciary, so it is no wonder that the clever Japanese avoid it like dirt. The total number of Japanese officials in each department of the puppet state and their percentages are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e85">Situation of the Panchen Lama's Arrival in Beiping <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Panchen Lama Will Arrive in Beijing to Discuss Tibetan Affairs</p>
<p>Ma Bufang Welcomes the Panchen Lama's Return to Tibet</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Panchen Erdeni, the Great Master of Protecting the Nation and Spreading Enlightenment, recently left Bailing Temple for Suiyuan. On the morning of the 18th, at 10:00 AM, he transferred from Suiyuan to a specially prepared train southward. The train was extremely beautiful. The locomotive was numbered 117. The Panchen Lama's own flower car was numbered 101. The sleeper car for the Khenpos and secretaries was numbered 231. The dining car was numbered 170. These were all requisitioned from the Beining Railway. The remaining cars consisted of first-class car 251, third-class cars 110 and 112, two flat cars for luggage, and four open cars for transporting 15 automobiles. These were all cars from the Pingsui Railway. The train arrived in Zhangjiakou at 6:00 AM today (the 19th) and departed at 7:00 AM. The journey was slower due to strong north winds. Accompanying him were Senji Khenpo, Da Zhuoni Khenpo, Dafu Khenpo, Zhao Zhuoni Khenpo, Secretary-General Liu Jiaju, Secretaries Li Yufeng and Xie Yongzhao, ten guards, ten sutra-chanting lamas, and 68 staff members in total. Central Government representative Leng Rong, Suiyuan Provincial Government Deputy Adjutant Yao, Director of the Panchen Lama's Suiyuan Office Ding Wang Duo Ji, and Deputy Director of the Beijing Office Zhu Haishan also traveled with the train. Upon arrival in Beiping at 5:00 PM, groups welcoming the Panchen Lama at the station included the Beiping Hengshan General Society, the Shanhua Buddhist Association, the Puji Buddhist Association, the Yonghe Temple, the Fuxiang Temple, the Puyou Temple, lamas, monks, nuns, the Puming Buddhist Association, the Lay Buddhist Forest, the Lotus Sect Pure Land Society Nianfo Society, the Women's Buddhist Studies Association, the Yonglan Buddhist Women's Association, the Buddhist Association, the Zixia Jixuan Xuan, the Mongolian-Tibetan Fellow-Villagers Association, the Beijing Office of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission, the Mongolian-Tibetan School, and the Qingkang Beiping Students Association. Mongol princes present included Nayantu, Ubaudutubobo, Amurkingelatu, Tong Haifeng, Ningxia Provincial Government Committee Member Dali Zazhaya, Zhangjia representative Li Shoushan, Gong Shushi. Representatives from the military and political circles included He Yingqin's representative Xu Ying, Yuan Liang's representative Liu Yuhu, Director of the Public Security Bureau Yu Jin Su, representative of the British Embassy Taikeman, Counselor Harada of the Japanese Embassy, and Chinese and foreign Buddhist disciples Wang Wenjin, Wang Wenyu, Tan Shuyuan, Yang YiWu, Song Ying, Gu Chongxin, Xue Jimin, Ye Zhongji, Lu Fengsheng, Guo Changhe, Geng Ruitian, Xiao Shufang, Liu Biqiu, Dai Chuanxian, Dean of the Examination Yuan, Lin Xiang. After the special train passed through Xizhimen, the Beijing East Railway Station was tightly guarded by a platoon of station gendarmes, the Fourth Team of the Public Security Bureau's security forces, and special agents. When the Panchen Lama alighted from the train, many Buddhist men and women raised a piece of yellow silk they had prepared, which the Panchen Lama placed on their heads as a blessing. After leaving the station, the Panchen Lama boarded a specially prepared car and drove to the Fengze Garden residence in Zhongnanhai.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by the Panchen Lama, he said that he had repeatedly received telegrams from important figures of the Central Government urging him to come to Beijing to discuss Mongolian and Tibetan border affairs. Therefore, he did not plan to stay in Beiping for long. However, due to a cough and headache, the date of his journey to Beijing was still uncertain. He had not yet decided whether he would be able to attend the Fourth Plenary Session. Therefore, he had not prepared any proposals. If the opportunity arose, he would report on the actual situation in Mongolia and Tibet. Regarding the issue of returning to Tibet, he had been in constant sorrow since the passing of the Dalai Lama. He had not considered how to manage Tibetan affairs. However, the matter of returning to Tibet would have to be decided after consultations with the Central Government. He planned to stay in Beijing for two months. According to a statement by the Panchen Lama's Secretary-General Liu Jiaju, the Panchen Lama had been away from Tibet for twelve years and had always been thinking of returning. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama had a harmonious personal relationship. After the passing of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama did not eat for a week. In addition to discussing the issue of returning to Tibet with the Central Government, the Panchen Lama's visit to Beijing also had the important tasks of commemorating the Dalai Lama and coordinating the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy. There was no question that the Panchen Lama would return to Tibet. When he returns north in the future, he may first go to Qinghai. The Qinghai Propaganda Office had already been established in Xiangde. More than 150 pieces of luggage and a radio station had been transported there. The rumor that Ma Bufang held objections was completely inaccurate. Because he and the director of the Beijing Office, Luo Sang Jianzan, had met with Ma Bufang in Nanjing last September, and Ma had expressed a warm welcome. Furthermore, the people of Qinghai and various quarters in Tibet had sent a flood of telegrams welcoming the Panchen Lama's return to Tibet, which proved that his words were not false. Deputy Director of the Beijing Office Zhu Haishan had previously been ordered to go to Qinghai. Because the results of the consultations were satisfactory, he recently flew from Beiping to Suiyuan to visit the Panchen Lama and report everything. This also proved that the rumors were not credible. (19th)</p>

<p>Hou Cheng Arrives in Taiyuan with a Mission</p>
<p>Requesting Yan Xishan to Eliminate the Scourge of War</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since the conflict between the Sun and Ma armies in western Suiyuan, the situation in the Northwest has suddenly become tense. As Sun Dianying and Yan Xishan have long been comrades in arms, and Yan and Sun have a close relationship forged in adversity, it is most appropriate and effective for Yan to mediate the matter or directly order Sun to cease military actions. Therefore, since the incident occurred, the Central Government, Chairman Chiang, Minister He, and others have telegraphed Yan, requesting him to quickly dissuade Sun to avoid escalating the situation. Ma Hongkui also sent a representative to Taiyuan to visit Yan and report on the situation. The Beiping Military Council believes that Sun's actions are of great importance to the Northwest frontier defense and should be resolved quickly. In addition to numerous consultations with Yan by telegram in recent days, the Beiping Military Council has specially sent Hou Cheng, a councilor of the Beiping Military Council, to Taiyuan this afternoon (the 18th) to visit Yan with a personal letter from He Yingqin, presenting everything in person. Hou stayed at the Shanxi Hotel. Both the Suiyuan and Shanxi authorities sent personnel to receive him. According to Hou's statement, "After receiving reports of the conflict between the Sun and Ma armies in Ningbian, Chairman He immediately telegraphed both sides, urging them to first cease military actions and send personnel to investigate the truth. Now, because Director Yan has a deep friendship with Commander Sun, in addition to the Central Government's telegram to Yan requesting him to find a way to eliminate the conflict, he was sent to Taiyuan to present everything in person, requesting immediate and vigorous mediation to resolve the dispute. Tonight or tomorrow morning, he will visit the Suiyuan authorities to visit Yan. Regarding Sun Dianying's troops, the Beiping Military Council stipulated that when allocating funds to the various armies in North China, this army was allocated a monthly subsidy of 200,000 yuan from the Military Council. In addition to six infantry regiments, special service and cavalry units of about two regiments were approved. Chairman He is now trying to stop this conflict in accordance with the principle of mediation, and he hopes that Director Yan will mediate to prevent the situation from escalating." Hou also plans to visit Sun's representative Gao Mengqin and Ma's representative Kang Yushu for consultations after visiting Yan. (18th)</p>

<h3 id="e91">The Chamber of Commerce Submits the Re-election to the Ministry of Industry for Interpretation <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce conducted a re-election on the 15th of this month. Prior to this, it received instructions from the Provincial Party Headquarters through the County Party Headquarters, stipulating that if the incumbents on the Executive Committee were elected to the Supervisory Committee, or the incumbents on the Supervisory Committee were elected to the Executive Committee, the re-election of the Chamber of Commerce and trade associations would be invalid. The Chamber of Commerce held that the Chamber of Commerce Law did not expressly stipulate this, and the matter concerned laws and regulations, which could not be interpreted arbitrarily. On that day, it sent telegrams to the Central Party Headquarters, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry for interpretation. It received a telegram from the Ministry of Industry, which stated that "The prior question to the aforementioned election situation is whether the Executive and Supervisory Committees can hold concurrent positions. Although the laws and regulations regarding the Chamber of Commerce and trade associations do not explicitly prohibit concurrent positions, the nature of the Executive and Supervisory Committees is that one is the executor of the association's affairs and the other is the supervisor of the execution of the association's affairs, and there is no reason why they can hold concurrent positions. If the elected person is willing to resign from their old position and take up the new position, there is no obstacle. [seal of the Ministry of Industry]." Upon receiving the telegram, the Chamber of Commerce stated that the case had been instructed by the Party Headquarters, and in accordance with Article 10 of the Central Amendment to the General Rules for Elections of People's Organizations, a part of the election was invalid, with three items listed clearly. It did not involve the fact that incumbent members of the Executive and Supervisory Committees cannot elect each other, and it should not be arbitrarily asserted, so as not to disregard the Central Government. Therefore, it sent another telegram to the Ministry of Industry for clear instructions on how to handle the matter, and sent a copy of the original telegram to the Party and government authorities for reference.</p>

<p>It has been repeatedly reported that Zhang Xueliang was going to Beijing, but it never materialized. Yesterday, upon receiving a telegram summons, he finally departed from Zhenru Station by night train at 11 p.m. last night, accompanied by his secretary and aides, to go to Beijing to meet with Chairman Chiang and the central authorities to report on everything and to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. He will stay in Beijing for a short while before returning to Shanghai. Also traveling to Beijing on the same train last night were Huang Xuchu, Chu Minyi, Li Shijia, and others.</p>

<p>They Went to the Capital That Evening to Attend the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<p>Guangdong Representative Yang Dezhao Came Along</p>
<p>Huang Xuchu, a member of the Fourth Plenary Session representing Guangxi Province, along with Central Committee member Chen Zhongfu, Chen Jitang, and Yang Dezhao, the representative of Guangxi stationed in Beijing, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the President Cleveland of the Great Eastern Shipping Company yesterday morning at 7:30 a.m. Huang took the night train to Beijing that evening to attend the plenary session. Yang stayed in Shanghai for a short while and will go to Beijing in a few days to meet with Chairman Chiang and report on everything. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>According to Yang Dezhao, when interviewed by reporters, Huang Xuchu departed from Guilin on the 15th, passed through Hong Kong, met with Mr. Hu Zhantang, and then took a ship to Shanghai on the 19th to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. After arriving in Shanghai this morning (i.e., yesterday morning), he briefly met with friends from Guangxi in Shanghai and then took the night train to Beijing.

<p>When reporters inquired about the Southwest authorities' attitude towards the Fujian issue, he replied that the rebellion in Fujian Province had been resolved, and the issue of incorporating the 19th Route Army would be subject to the central government's orders. Chen Bonan (Chen Jitang) has absolutely no opinion on incorporating the army, and rumors that Chen intends to incorporate the army are inaccurate. As for the reports that the Southwest authorities telegraphed the central government, requesting that it not pursue the defeated Chen Mingshu and Cai Tingkai when the national army captured Fuzhou and they retreated to Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, this is also not true. As far as he knows, the Southwest side did not make such a request. In short, Chen Bonan has no suggestions regarding anything in Fujian Province going forward.</p>

<p>As for Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others, they had considerable history and friendship with the leaders of the Southwest before the Fujian Incident. Now that Chen and Li have declared their departure from the Kuomintang and have committed acts of treason against the party and the country, there is no doubt that the Southwest will not allow them to set foot there again. As for Chen Youren, he has no close relationship with the Southwest. In the future, Chen and Li will be discredited and may go abroad.</p>

<p>The Southwest continues to suppress bandits, hoping to eradicate the banditry in Jiangxi Province as soon as possible. They are also proceeding with local construction matters according to their original plans. As for Xiao Focheng, he has requested leave to go to Siam due to old age and poor health, as well as the unsuitable climate of Guangdong for recuperation. He is expected to return to China in about three or four months. Hu Hanmin is still residing in Hong Kong, and it is said that his health has improved slightly.</p>

<p>To Attend the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters sent an express telegram yesterday: "To all Central Committee members staying in Shanghai, in recent years, the country has faced many difficulties, both internal and external, threatening the very foundation of the nation and causing suffering for the people. Our party bears the mission of building and governing the country, yet the Central Committee members have failed to gather in the capital to jointly discuss national affairs, arousing suspicion among comrades and inviting blame from outside the party. The advantages and disadvantages of this situation are clear to all. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee has been scheduled to convene soon in Nanjing. We earnestly request you to go to Beijing immediately to attend the plenary session, end past disputes, and change the perceptions of those at home and abroad. The future of the party and the nation depends on this. We eagerly await your arrival. Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang."</p>

<p>Requesting Explicit Regulations on the Organization of the General Labor Union</p>
<p>Temporary Registration Should Be Permitted Before the Promulgation of New Laws</p>
<p>Dagong News reports: "The Shanghai General Labor Union submitted a request to the Fourth Plenary Session yesterday: '(Omitted above) Requesting a petition to the National Government to instruct the Legislative Yuan to promptly revise the Labor Union Law, explicitly stipulating that each province and city may organize a General Labor Union or promulgate separate organizational regulations for the Shanghai General Labor Union, and requesting the Central People's Movement Committee to provisionally approve the registration of professional associations before the promulgation of the new law, in order to provide relief and facilitate progress. Since the promulgation of the Labor Union Law, the former Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai General Labor Union was canceled due to the restrictions of the law. As a result, the labor movement in Shanghai lost its</p>
<h3 id="e102">Leading Center <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>and fell into a state of division and decline. When the Liaoning Incident suddenly broke out and the national crisis became serious, the labor community in Shanghai, realizing the growing urgency of the national crisis, understood that only sincere unity could save the country and resist foreign aggression. Therefore, the Professional Association, in response to the urgent needs of the environment, was established through the resolution of the city-wide labor representatives' congress. It has been three years since its establishment, and its past work has been remarkable and widely recognized by all sectors. However, due to legal restrictions, there have been many obstacles to its progress. Therefore, in September of last year, a request was submitted to the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters,</p>
<h3 id="e103">Requesting Approval for Registration <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>After careful consideration, the Municipal Party Headquarters considered that the organization of the Professional Association was necessary in light of the circumstances and approved temporary registration on October 2 and reported this to the Central Government. However, the Central People's Movement Committee recently ordered that the name be changed to the "National Salvation Federation of Various Industry Labor Unions" on the grounds that the Professional Association violated the law. Considering its meaning, the work in the future will be subject to strict restrictions. The entire labor community is deeply bewildered. We hereby state the reasons and request the maintenance of the original organization. Since its establishment, the affiliated association has made the greatest efforts to lead the city's labor community in responding to the serious national crisis, and it has achieved significant results in preventing communist activities, resolving disputes in various industries, and promoting cooperation between labor and management. Other efforts include holding labor education lectures, summer labor temporary relief centers, and running labor supplementary night schools, paying attention to the welfare of workers and sparing no effort to seek further progress. Therefore, based on the past achievements, it is necessary to allow it to exist. This is the first reason. The Professional Association, due to its past efforts, has gained deep recognition from all sectors of the city. All</p>
<h3 id="e104">Important Legal Entities <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>recognize that the Professional Association is the only general labor movement group, and the various industry labor unions in the city can convey their fervent belief and unanimously support it. Thus, although the Professional Association is not legally based, it has in fact gained public recognition. This is the second reason for requesting approval to exist. Since its establishment, the Professional Association has exchanged telegrams with various government agencies, and the cases have become numerous. For example, the National Government Civil Service Office, the Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Central Propaganda Committee, and the Shanghai Municipal Government have all sent approvals or letters to the association. Last year, the Professional Association, recognizing the importance of aviation construction, raised a large amount of money and donated it to the government. Chairman Lin of the National Government also</p>
<h3 id="e105">Awarded a Citation <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Thus, although the Professional Association has not obtained legal protection, it has been recognized by government agencies that enforce the law. This is the third reason for requesting approval to exist. In view of the fact that the Central Government allows general organizations for agricultural, commercial, and academic sectors, we, the labor community, are also citizens. Why should we be excluded? This is the fourth reason for requesting approval to exist. In summary, whether in terms of reason or law, the Professional Association needs to exist. Therefore, we have prepared this document to request your review and resolution, approving a petition to the National Government to instruct the Legislative Yuan to promptly revise the Labor Union Law, making sure to</p>
<h3 id="e106">Explicitly Stipulate <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>that each province and city may organize a general labor union or promulgate separate organizational regulations for the Shanghai General Labor Union, and requesting the Central People's Movement Committee to provisionally approve the registration of professional associations before the promulgation of the new law, in order to provide relief and facilitate progress. This is extremely urgent. Respectfully submitted to the Presidium of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, Shanghai General Labor Union, respectfully submitted."</p>

<p>The Central District Branch of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, due to incomplete bidding procedures before the relocation of the municipal government, was unable to be constructed. All central district telephone connections are temporarily handled by the Jiangwan Branch. It is now learned that the Telephone Bureau and Dong Ruihe Construction Company have drafted a plan to build a two-story Western-style building, occupying one mu of land. The design of the building was created by Lu Qianshou, the section chief of the Architecture Department of the Bank of China. The price is 26,750 yuan, and a contract has been signed, with delivery expected four months from the start of construction. The Telephone Bureau has submitted the plan to the Ministry of Communications for review, and construction will begin as soon as the approval is issued, with completion expected by the end of May.</p>

As of yesterday afternoon, the local company had not received any news of the aircraft leaving Kunming.

<p>To Be Implemented Starting This Year</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Manila, Philippines, yesterday stating: "We have noted that in recent years, the commercial situation in the Philippines has been deteriorating, and both large and small Chinese businesses are in a precarious state and struggling to survive. However, those coming to the Philippines to solicit donations from the mainland are arriving in droves, even more than before. If this situation is not carefully considered and is allowed to continue without restraint, the currency will flow out and the treasury will become empty, leading to the decline and ruin of businesses. In view of this, our chamber convened a joint meeting on December 5 with the Overseas Chinese Education Association, the Overseas Chinese Charity Association, and the various industry trade associations in order to protect the status of overseas Chinese in the Philippines. The meeting unanimously agreed that it is necessary to sympathize with the difficult times and suspend donations in order to recuperate and benefit commercial operations. It was resolved that, starting next year (i.e., 1934), all those coming from the mainland to solicit donations will be unanimously refused. If necessary, a joint meeting of the above-mentioned organizations will be convened to resolve the issue. Accordingly, we have recorded this and hereby inform you for your reference and request that you forward this information to various agencies and organizations in all areas so that those who wish to go abroad to solicit donations do not come to the Philippines in order to avoid futile trips and wasted time.

The accident analysis is recorded as follows: (1) Fires: 68 incidents, 13 deaths, 37 injuries, losses of 2 million yuan; (2) Falls: 27 incidents, 21 deaths, 28 injuries; (3) Electrocutions: 22 incidents, 23 deaths, losses of 300,000 yuan; (4) Explosions: 13 incidents, 108 deaths, 155 injuries; (5) Crushing: 11 incidents, 8 deaths, 4 injuries; (6) Strikes: 9 incidents, 8 deaths, 7 injuries; (7) Pressing: 7 incidents, 9 deaths, 5 injuries; (8) Burns: 6 incidents, 4 deaths, 4 injuries; (9) Impact: 1 incident, 1 injury. Total: 165 incidents, 194 deaths, 221 injuries, total deaths 415, total losses 1.3 million yuan. According to the above table, fires were the most frequent type of accident, accounting for 41% of the total, followed by falls, electrocutions, explosions, and crushings. Explosions accounted for the most deaths and injuries, at 58%, followed by floods, falls, electrocutions, strikes, and pressings. Judging from the number of occurrences and the percentage of deaths and injuries, explosions were the most serious, followed by fires. The greatest economic losses for factories were due to fires, followed by explosions.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs Ordered the Two Associations to Cease Activities</p>
<p>New Sound News reports: "The Fire Insurance Compensation Coordination Association and the Claims Association in the disaster area of this city were established because the insured parties suffered heavy losses during the January 28th battle. They requested the municipal government and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to negotiate for compensation in order to provide relief. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs repeatedly convened meetings on this case and sent personnel to coordinate. However, the bureau believes that the area directly damaged by artillery fire in this city during the January 28th battle was almost half of the entire city, and the citizens who suffered heavy losses were not limited to the insured parties. Although a total of 500,000 yuan in relief funds has been allocated successively for various active relief and temporary emergency relief efforts, it is ultimately a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. It was decided to expand this case to provide relief to general disaster victims in the war zone, so that both insured and uninsured parties in each war zone can enjoy the benefits of relief. The bureau has been soliciting funds from Chinese and foreign organizations for this purpose. As the Fire Insurance Compensation Coordination Association and the Claims Association are now unnecessary, they have been instructed to cease activities."</p>

<h3 id="e122">Report from the Chinese Cotton Statistics Association on the Final Estimate of National Cotton Production <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Cotton Production Totals 9,621,240 Dan</p>
<p>The Highest Production in the Last Fifteen Years</p>
<p>According to the Kwowen News Agency, the Chinese Cotton Statistics Association recently released its final estimate report on national cotton production for the past year. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Estimation Process: This estimation is based on reports from (1) eleven provinces, including Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, as well as the two cities of Shanghai and Tianjin; (2) cotton crop conditions before December 10th as the standard; (3) the losses from disasters affecting cotton crops in various provinces before December 10th were all taken into account; (4) cotton fields were measured in Chinese acres (華畝), and cotton production was measured in dan (擔). The estimated results are as follows: cotton field area of 40,453,953 acres, ginned cotton production of 9,621,240 dan, and abandoned field area of 617,398 acres. According to the revised estimate for the 21st year of the Republic (1932), the cotton field area was 37,009,800 acres, and the ginned cotton production was 8,105,637 dan.</p>
<p>Comparison of Two Years: This estimate can now be considered the final actual yield. The 9,621,240 dan represents an increase of 1,515,603 dan compared to the 21st year of the Republic. This high yield is not only unprecedented in recent years but also the largest production figure since the 8th year of the Republic (1919). At a time when domestic cotton production cannot meet demand and huge amounts of foreign cotton are imported, this is a relatively gratifying report. The increase in production is mainly due to the increase in cotton fields. The increase in cotton fields is more significant in the north, as the disturbances caused by soldiers and bandits have subsided somewhat, and farmers can live relatively peacefully. In addition, the weather has been favorable, with ample rainfall, which has led to an increase in cotton fields. The soil in the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi is most suitable for cotton cultivation. If irrigation methods can be developed for farmers and there are no wars, the promotion of cotton cultivation will be very easy. Cotton production in the south is generally higher than in the north. Since the severe floods in Jiangsu and Hubei provinces, which were major cotton-producing areas, in the 20th year of the Republic (1931), cotton production has been greatly reduced. Although there has been recovery in recent years, the rural areas are still not very peaceful. Therefore, the rate of increase in cotton fields cannot keep pace with that in the north.</p>
<p>Overview of Cotton Fields: This year, the area of cotton fields has increased in provinces such as Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, and Jiangsu, with the most significant increases in Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hubei, and Jiangsu. Cotton cultivation along the Pinghan Railway in Hebei is developing rapidly. In Shanxi, local conditions have been relatively stable in recent years, and cotton production has been recovering. In Henan and Shaanxi, there have been no wars, and grain prices are low, so cotton fields have increased. Hubei and Jiangsu suffered severe floods in the 20th year of the Republic, which greatly reduced cotton fields, but recovery has been rapid in recent years. Other provinces have also made progress year by year. Therefore, the total area of cotton fields has been increasing over the years. In the spring and summer of this year, there was abundant rainfall in the north, and cotton crops were sown in a timely manner, which is a major reason for the sharp increase in cotton fields in the north this year. However, there was a slight decrease in Shandong, and many fields were flooded by the Yellow River in the autumn. Fortunately, the water receded quickly, and there was not a total loss.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Youth League for the Eradication of Communism Petitions for the Banning of Proletarian Films <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Specifically Presented to the Central Executive Committee and Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Board of Directors of the Chinese Youth League for the Eradication of Communism recently submitted a document to the Central Standing Committee and the Military Commission Chairman Chiang, stating: "Since the Communist Party members infiltrated the film industry, they have been producing proletarian films in large quantities. The content mostly incites class antagonism and the struggle between the rich and the poor, and vigorously provokes conflicts among various ethnic groups in the country, which is extremely hateful. According to our investigation, the so-called four major film companies in Shanghai, such as Star, Lianhua, Yihua, and Tianyi, have been under the planned control of Communist elements in recent years, and they are using commercial companies as propaganda tools, which endangers the country and poisons society to the extreme. Now that the Red bandits are rampant in the hinterland and foreign troubles are lurking on the borders, your Chairman is planning to pacify the country internally and resist foreign aggression externally to establish the nation on a solid foundation. How can we allow this kind of propaganda of red ideology and evil heresies that create banditry to continue to run rampant? The affiliated association, witnessing the difficulties of the times, dares not be complacent. It is our inescapable responsibility to save the nation from ruin and to survive. Therefore, we have issued a declaration to eradicate the Red activities in the film industry. We now attach two copies for your inspection. We respectfully ask that you take note of this and awaken the attention of all sectors. In addition to sending letters to film companies and theaters across the country to warn them, we once again appeal to your Chairman to order all relevant authorities to strictly ban the production, screening, and publication of films and film reviews that promote proletarian ideology. Those that have already been filmed or are in progress, such as 'Torrent,' 'The Light of Motherhood,' 'Salt Tide,' 'Oppression,' 'Sweet Grass Beauty,' 'Dawn,' 'A Woman's Cry,' 'City Nights,' 'Shanghai Twenty-Four Hours,' 'A Bumper Harvest,' 'Wind,' 'The Golden Age,' 'Flames,' 'Hand-to-Hand Combat,' 'National Survival,' and 'Exhibition,' should be revised immediately or stopped. We also request that you issue arrest warrants for the Red elements lurking in the film industry, such as Tian Han (i.e., Chen Yu), Shen Duanxian (i.e., Ding Qian, Ding Yi Zhi), Mao Dun (i.e., Shen Yanbing), Qian Xingcun, Shen Xiling, and Xu Xingzhi, and punish them for the crime of endangering the Republic of China. We also request that you inform all film companies that they are absolutely not allowed to use the scripts written by these Red elements, and those who hold positions as directors, etc., must be immediately dismissed and sent to the local authorities for investigation. Furthermore, the responsible members of the Nanjing Film Censorship Committee, as central officials in charge of censorship, have repeatedly passed reactionary films, bending the law and deliberately condoning them. It is obvious that they either have ulterior motives or have secretly accepted bribes and cannot escape punishment. Therefore, we implore Your Committee (Chairman) to order their dismissal and investigation in order to warn the wicked. This is for the benefit of the Party," and so on.</p>

<p>Yichang and Other Counties in Hubei</p>
<p>Repeatedly Petition for Exemption</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce, due to receiving telegrams and letters from the chambers of commerce of Yichang County, Shashi, Hubei Province, Wuwei County, Xiang'an Town, Anhui Province, etc., appealing for exemption from the increased salt tax in order to maintain the people's food supply, yesterday specifically telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating: (Titles omitted) "We recently received telegrams and letters from the chambers of commerce of Yichang County, Shashi, Hubei Province, Wuwei County, Xiang'an Town, Anhui Province, which roughly stated: 'The Ministry of Finance telegraphed that from January 1st, the tax payment for all salt will be changed to using new scales, and 17 jin will be temporarily added per dan according to the old scales for collection, which is equivalent to an increase of more than two yuan and nine jiao per dan. The Ministry of Finance had already increased the surtax on salt in western Hubei by one yuan and five jiao per dan last year. Representatives publicly elected by the people of western Hubei went to Beijing to petition, but they were not granted a repeal of the order, nor were they granted any reduction. This time, with the change to new scales, the increase could be as much as two yuan and nine jiao per dan, which is truly unbearable for the people. They have repeatedly petitioned for exemption. In addition to sending separate telegrams to the provincial federation of commerce, we specifically telegraphed your association, earnestly requesting you to strive for this with the Ministry in order to maintain the people's food supply, and we earnestly hope,' and so on. In view of this, we hereby telegraphically report to Your Ministry for your examination and approval. We earnestly request that you consider the people's hardship and exempt them from the increase, which is our most fervent prayer. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, bows his head."</p>

<p>After the Puan steamer of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company returned to Shanghai after being robbed by pirates, it has now sailed to Qingdao as usual. The authorities in Guangdong and Fujian have sent military police to encircle and suppress the pirates and rescue the passengers. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Encirclement and Suppression of Pirates <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Board of Directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has decided to offer a reward of 10,000 yuan for the strict arrest of the pirates who robbed the Puan steamer, and has also telegraphed Chairman Chiang, requesting him to instruct the strict arrest of the pirates and the rescue of the passengers. Yesterday, they received a reply telegram from Chairman Chiang, who has instructed the Guangdong and Fujian provincial governments to order the nearby military police to encircle and suppress the pirates and rescue the abducted passengers. At the same time, the Navy Department has dispatched warships stationed in Xiamen to Zhao'an to encircle and suppress the pirates.</p>

<p>General Manager Liu Hongsheng has not only sent the passengers who suffered on the Puan steamer to Qingdao free of charge as usual but also provided meals. The Puan steamer has now safely arrived in Qingdao. As for the clothing of the ship's crew, such as Purser Zou Lun, First Officer Sun Zuoren, etc., which was robbed by the pirates, the General Bureau will compensate them according to the loss reports submitted by each crew member to show its concern.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Maritime Steamer Workers of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Went on Strike Yesterday <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Steamer Has Been Leased to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Sail to Northern and Southern Ports</p>
<p>The Seamen's Union Sent Representatives to Persuade Them to Resume Work, but to No Avail</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, all the workers on the Maritime Steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company went on strike yesterday because they opposed the company's unwarranted dismissal of workers and rejected the union's mediation. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e131">Carrying Smuggled Goods <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Since the Maritime Steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was leased to the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to operate the Shanghai-Qingdao and Shanghai-Guangdong northern and southern routes, the original workers in the middle cabin, cargo handlers, stokers, sailors, and other departments also served on the steamer, but they were still under the jurisdiction of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Unexpectedly, in August last year, some workers on the steamer carried smuggled goods, which were seized by the Guangdong Customs, and they were fined more than 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Dismissal of Sailors <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>At that time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company temporarily paid the fine, and after returning to Shanghai, it turned to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for reimbursement. However, because the workers could not pay, they paid half each. The workers, on the other hand, sought a guarantor and agreed to pay in installments. Unexpectedly, the company deducted two months' salary from the workers and dismissed more than a dozen sailors from the entire sailor department, including Wang Yongfa and Zhu Shunbao. The other workers were extremely angry that the company deducted their salaries and dismissed them.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Unsuccessful Negotiations <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>After the company dismissed the workers in the sailor department last year, it hired Xu Huimin and other twelve people to fill the vacancies. The old workers who were dismissed petitioned the Seamen's Union to negotiate for their reinstatement. However, after the union repeatedly sent staff members Cheng Deyuan and Gao Shuren to negotiate with the company's manager, Ye Chuanfang, the company ignored them. This month, the branch union took over the negotiations, but it was also ineffective.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Complete Strike <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Maritime Steamer arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong at 8:00 AM yesterday and docked at the Yangjiadu Wharf in the Nanshi district. It was originally scheduled to sail to Qingdao today. Unexpectedly, at 3:30 PM, all 68 workers on the steamer, including twelve stokers, thirty-two cargo handlers, twelve sailors, five middle cabin workers, and six pursers, stopped working and declared a strike.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Union Persuasion <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Upon hearing the report, the Seamen's Union and the Seamen's Branch Union, believing that the case was serious and fearing that it would lead to further complications and affect travelers, sent Cheng Fanyuan from the General Union, together with branch union committee member Lu Rongzhi, to the wharf at 4:00 PM to persuade them to resume work. However, all the workers were very determined, so despite repeated persuasion, it was still ineffective, and the situation was very serious.</p>

<p>A Written Record of Three Items Signed Yesterday at the Social Bureau</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Wanbao Silk Factory on Route Sapey in the French Concession, which has a total of 120 workers, had a dispute recently due to the factory's unwarranted reduction of wages. Yesterday, the Social Bureau convened both parties for mediation. The workers' representatives were Gu Yuqing and Xie Yuanlong, and the factory's representatives were Li Mingzhi and Xuan Taihua. The meeting was chaired by Zhu Guilin, a staff member from the Third Section of the Social Bureau. After inquiring about the reasons, both parties reached an agreement and signed a written record of three items on the spot, and the dispute was resolved. The items are: (1) The price of brocade crepe work is reduced to one jiao and three fen and five li per yard, and the price of plain satin is reduced to seven fen per yard; (2) For every four machines, the workers may hire one helper, and the factory will subsidize the helper's wage at two yuan per machine per month for day and night shifts; (3) The above measures will be implemented from today, and they may be restored when the market improves.</p>

They are striving for novelty in terms of form and color in order to suit modern aesthetics. It is also reported that many national goods factories have come to discuss participation, but the chamber, in order to be cautious about the matter, will only select those factories with high-quality products to join.</p>
<h3 id="e138">The French Concession Drastically Restricts Rickshaw Licenses <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Rickshaw Operators in Nanshi Petition for Assistance from the Taxpayers' Association</p>
<p>Rickshaw licenses in the French Concession used to be freely purchased by rickshaw operators. Since the board of directors decided to limit the number to 17,000, in addition to the 10,000 licenses allocated to the Public Concession, among the remaining 7,000 licenses, due to the rush to purchase licenses in western Shanghai, the rickshaw operators in Nanshi who have fulfilled their tax payment obligations over the years have rickshaws but no licenses, which affects their livelihood and business and makes it impossible for them to maintain their operations. Yesterday, they specifically submitted a petition to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, requesting assistance. The original text of the petition is recorded below: "We are submitting this petition to express our grievances and request that the French Municipal Council consider the livelihood of the poor and supplement rickshaw licenses. We, the operators of rickshaw companies in Nanshi, have been operating rickshaws with licenses from the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council for many years. As for the French Concession licenses, in addition to the 10,000 licenses allocated to the Public Concession with designated numbers, there has never been a fixed number in Nanshi. Rickshaw operators freely pay taxes depending on whether business is good or bad, so they can barely maintain their operations with profit and loss adjustments. Unexpectedly, recently, with the bankruptcy of rural areas north of the Yangtze River, there are more and more rickshaw pullers, and rickshaws from Zhabei and western Shanghai have all moved here to operate, resulting in a shortage of the 7,000 rickshaw licenses temporarily stipulated by the French Municipal Council, and the rickshaw operators who have been operating in Nanshi for many years are unable to obtain licenses because they were a little late in paying taxes. They can only sigh in vain. Those rickshaws with only single-sided Chinese licenses can only operate in a limited area in the Chinese territory. There are also many who reside in the French Concession and cannot operate. The suffering suffered by rickshaw operators and rickshaw pullers in the past two months cannot be described in words. Although we are extremely anxious, regarding the temporary regulations of the French Municipal Council, we still hope that it will take into account the actual needs and make proper arrangements for the livelihood of these poor people. Therefore, we have tried our best to comfort the rickshaw pullers and waited quietly for a solution. However, we have been waiting again and again, but there is no hope. We only hear that the French Municipal Council is ordering rickshaw operators who have already paid taxes to go through the formalities of obtaining a guarantee and paying taxes, but it has not heard or asked about the suffering of the rickshaw operators who are eagerly waiting. We, who are suffering from the aftermath of war, are deeply afraid that if the rickshaw business on which we depend for our livelihood is once lost, we will inevitably face the tragedy of our families being displaced. And five or six rickshaw pullers pull one rickshaw, and there are currently about three or four hundred rickshaws without licenses, with about two thousand rickshaw pullers. If we do not find a way to provide relief from this innocent loss, the impact on the future of society will be unimaginable. Moreover, there are records in the tax collection office of the French Municipal Council of the licenses we rickshaw operators have paid for. Even if there are restrictions, they should be carefully considered based on the order of priority. However, without our knowledge, the sudden disruption to our business has caused great obstacles to our operations, and disputes among operators due to unfairness will be inevitable. Therefore, we are submitting this petition to request that Your Association, based on the facts, appeal to the French Municipal Council to pay attention to the livelihood of the poor and allow us, the operators who were temporarily unable to pay taxes, to supplement our taxes in accordance with the records of the tax collection office. We are also willing to comply with the regulations to provide a guarantee and pay taxes and will never delay or resist. This is for the sake of the Municipal Council. Supplementing the taxes is limited and will increase revenue, and the livelihood of our dozens of operators and thousands of rickshaw pullers will be maintained for a while, which is also a measure of adapting to the times. We have always admired Your Association's concern for the livelihood of the common people, and we earnestly ask that you grant our request and provide us with effective assistance. We are infinitely grateful and await your orders. Sincerely submitted to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, Rickshaw Operators in Nanshi, Lü Xiushan, Yu Shanjiang, Wang Taikang, Wu Jiufa, Jiang Heshang, Chen Changsheng, Li Pingyu, Liu Qikuan, Zhou Jungong, Zhang Zhengkui, Li Wanzhang, et al."</p>

<p>The Yong'an Company was robbed of more than 18,000 yuan on December 6th last year. At that time, You A'gen, the chief detective of the Laoza Gate Police Station, arrested the main robbers in the case, Yan A'mao, Feng Zuowen, the woman Pan Meimei, and the instigator Hu Songshan, four people in total. One handgun and many bullets were confiscated. They were handed over to the First Special Court, where they were sentenced separately. However, the ringleader Da A'ge and others were still at large. It was not until the 6th of this month that Lu Liankui, the chief inspector of the General Inspection Office, and Detective Liu Shaokui learned that Da A'ge was Lin Yunliang, also known as Xia Liang, from Ningbo, who was hiding at No. 4, Xiaodong's House, Jiangqiao Temple, Xixiang, outside the Ximen of Zhenhai, Ningbo. They ordered Chinese detectives Chen Yonggui and Wu Hanzhang to go there and arrest Lin. At the same time, Lin's brother, Lin Yuncai, was also arrested. They were brought back to Shanghai, and Fang A'di, a principal offender from Pudong, was arrested in Room 144 of the Hongkou Grand Hotel. In total, one handgun, six bullets, and 9,600 yuan of the original stolen money were confiscated. The police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed a public prosecution with the First Special Court in accordance with the law. After the interrogation was concluded, Feng Shide, the head of the criminal court, took his seat in the Criminal Court No. 1 yesterday morning and announced the verdict: Lin Yunliang and Lin Yuncai were each sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, and Fang A'di was sentenced to thirteen years of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the judgment was finalized will be counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days. The handgun and six bullets were confiscated, and the stolen 9,600 yuan was returned to the victim.</p>

<p>Boy Ma Wenzi Dies from Serious Injuries</p>
<p>Passenger Wang Shaotang Suffers Serious Injuries</p>
<p>Ma Tangshi from Jiangbei, who lives in Yaojiaqiao, Zhabei, purchased a coffin because her husband's brother, Ma A'san, died in Caohejing. She hired a freight truck from the Xinzhapu Bridge, Beihua Bacon Truck Company to transport the coffin to Caohejing. The company sent four workers, and the driver Wu Changsheng from Yancheng (27 years old) drove truck No. 3842. Ma Tangshi also accompanied the truck with her three-year-old boy, Ma Wenzi, in her arms. Unexpectedly, when the truck reached the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai, a local resident, Wang Shaotang, who lives in Chengjiaqiao, was riding in a car from the Dongxin Motor Company (driver Zhao Linxiang from Pudong, 28 years old), driving car No. 963, rental license No. 12416, on Hongqiao Road, going from east to west to the intersection of Zhongshan Road. Because both vehicles were driving very fast, they could not avoid each other and collided violently. The engine cylinders of the Dongxin Company's rental car were smashed, and all the parts were destroyed. Passenger Wang Shaotang's head and face were cut by glass, his eyes were protruding, and he was seriously injured. Ma Tangshi, who was standing on the truck, was shocked, causing Ma Wenzi to be thrown from her arms and fall to the ground. Zhou Yida, the police chief of the Hejiajiao Police Station, Second Precinct, Sixth District, arrived upon hearing the news. He first sent the injured boy Ma Wenzi and passenger Wang Shaotang to the Red Cross Hospital on Avenue Haig for treatment. However, Ma Wenzi died from serious injuries upon arrival at the hospital. The car drivers, Wu Changsheng and Zhao Linxiang, were taken to the Second Precinct, Sixth District for questioning. It was found that this area was where the Second Post of Hejiajiao was stationed. Two weeks ago, the post was temporarily withdrawn pending resolution due to the issue of boundary crossing negotiations. Unexpectedly, it was not long before several accidents were reported to have occurred.</p>

<p>The China General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists is holding its spring council meeting from the 12th to the 23rd of this month at the church's headquarters on Ningguo Road in this city to discuss this year's work plans for various departments and all administrative plans. In addition to President Dr. Miller and the staff of various departments of the General Affairs Office, there are more than 30 representatives from the East China, West China, South China, North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China Unions. After the end of today's meeting, the representatives will leave for home. The work of the church can be briefly divided into four departments: evangelism, education, medicine, and publications. During this meeting, in addition to the daily business time, there are also reports from each department on the progress of their work over the past year from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM every night. It is said that although the situation is turbulent and the economy is difficult, the church's service work, relying on the enthusiastic support of people in the country and the efforts of the church's staff, has made considerable progress in the past year. On the 18th, the representatives took a car to Qiaotou Town to attend the board meeting of the China San Yu Institute. In the past two days, they have also repeatedly visited the board meetings of the Shanghai Sanitarium and Health Hospital on Route Robegen and the Signs of the Times Publishing House on Ningguo Road. The China San Yu Institute is a place for training talents for the work of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and is one of the well-known vocational schools in the country, with more than 350 members, most of whom work diligently to support themselves. Its affiliated primary and secondary schools number about 150. All secondary schools have industries to help students support themselves. The Shanghai Sanitarium and Health Hospital aims to serve patients from all walks of life. There are ten branch hospitals throughout the country, and most of the expenses are supported by donations from people in the country. The Signs of the Times Publishing House is the center of the church's literary evangelism work, publishing regular publications such as the Signs of the Times Monthly and dozens of books such as Healthy Living and The World's Hope. There are more than 200 salespersons who sell them throughout the country. Last year's total business volume reached more than 240,000 yuan. The Signs of the Times Monthly has 78,000 subscribers. The Seventh-day Adventist Church's work in China began 30 years ago, founded by Dr. Miller and others in Guangzhou, Henan, and other places. After arduous management, it has made rapid progress. In recent years, it has also used "Go to the frontiers" as its slogan, aiming to spread throughout the country. The church advocates the separation of politics and religion, and its purpose is purely to cultivate believers who are suitable for Christian education, so that individuals, families, society, and the country can all move toward goodness. It is said that there are now more than 12,000 church members.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Recovering Cross-Border Telephones, the Telephone Company Adds a Manual Switchboard <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Cross-Border Telephones in Pudong Can Be Fully Recovered Next Month</p>
<p>Because the Telephone Bureau has repeatedly requested the recovery of cross-border telephones according to the temporary telephone contract, the company believes that once the Telephone Bureau recovers these cross-border telephones, communication between Chinese residents and the concessions will become more crowded, especially in Pudong (because most of the telephones in Pudong belong to foreign firms and godowns and are exclusively used for communication with the concessions). However, the Telephone Bureau's recovery of cross-border rights is inevitable. In order to facilitate the connection of telephones from the concessions to Pudong, the company has specifically added a "04" manual switchboard yesterday, which is exclusively for communication between Chinese residents and the concessions in Pudong. It is scheduled to be completed on February 10th. It will then notify the Telephone Bureau to handle the cutting of lines. Around February 20th, all telephones in Pudong can be completely transferred to the management of the Telephone Bureau.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Grain, Oil Cake, and Allied Trades Association hereby issues a public notice to all fellow businesses: We have received a letter from the Chief of the Second Section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Police, stating that regarding the matter of merchants sending people to grain stations to take samples, there are points that should be noted regarding procedures. We previously sent a letter notifying you of this and requesting that you inform your fellow businesses to take note. However, it has been found that while many of the samplers sent by various merchants follow the procedures, there are still quite a few who secretly engage in trickery. To protect both customers and goods, in addition to issuing notices to all warehouses and instructing all officers to inspect sample slips at any time, we are hereby sending this letter to you, hoping that you will inform your fellow businesses that from now on, when sending people to the station to take samples, they must carry a formal sample slip, clearly stating the number of the car from which the sample is taken and the name of the goods to be transported. They must not take advantage of the situation to take samples indiscriminately, so as to protect customer interests and facilitate railway transportation. You are hereby notified. All fellow businesses are requested to take note and comply.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Shipping Companies Hold Anti-Piracy Conference <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Officials from the Water and Land Police Departments Attended</p>
<p>Five Anti-Piracy Measures Resolved</p>
<p>Since the Executive Yuan promulgated the "Escort and Anti-Piracy Regulations," all shipping companies have complied with them. A special anti-piracy conference was held the day before yesterday to discuss anti-piracy measures. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives from various shipping companies attended the anti-piracy conference at the Shipping Club on the fourth floor of 10 Guangdong Road at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. Attendees included Yu Kekai from Ning Shao Company, Chen Yixian from Ping An Company, Zhou Bolun from Mao Li Bureau, Yang Guanbei and Yang Qingbang from Dada Company, Luo Lianchen from Huxing Company, Feng Zhongfang from Dayuan Company, Cao Qiming from Jufeng Binji Company, Mao Youren from Datong Renji Company, Chen Yisheng from Lian An Company, and Mao Youren from Dazhen Company. Zhu, the captain of the Water Patrol, Guan, the chief of the First District, Officer Guo, Gao, the deputy director of the Dock and Warehouse Management Office, and over twenty other people attended.</p>
<p>Measures Resolved: Chen Yisheng chaired the meeting and reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, discussions began. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the following matters were resolved: (A) For all ships berthed at the Nanshi Wharf, one hour before weighing anchor, the water police, accompanied by female inspectors, the ship's purser, and the accounting office or inspectors, will inspect the passengers. If passengers disembark at that time, the land police stationed at the wharf next to the ship will carry out the inspection to avoid omissions. The inspection rules will be determined separately. (B) The Dock Management Office will send a list of the departure dates and times of all ships to the water and land police agencies. (C) Each shipping company will prepare its own badges to be issued to all crew members, who must wear them. The names, positions, and badge styles of employees must be submitted to the Shipping Association by a deadline, which will then be forwarded to the water and land police agencies for filing. During inspections, anyone who is neither a passenger nor wearing a badge will be immediately expelled from the ship and taken ashore by the water police. Violators will be arrested and punished. (D) Because there are many ships departing at the same time, more police officers should be dispatched to carry out inspections. The expenses will be shared by the shipping companies. The amount of each company's share will be determined by the Shipping Association, which will send a letter to each company to obtain their agreement before implementation. The funds will be collected monthly by the Association and forwarded to the water and land police agencies for distribution. The uniforms and equipment for the newly recruited water and land police will be prepared and distributed by the water and land police agencies. (E) The First District will dispatch more plainclothes detectives to patrol the docks. The above resolutions will be sent by the Shipping Association to all companies and the water and land police agencies.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Recent Conditions of Inland River Transportation in the Severe Cold <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Laogang Reopened</p>
<p>Inland Rivers Frozen</p>
<p>Suzhou Creek Open to Navigation</p>
<p>Suzhou Creek is a key artery for inland river transportation. Several days ago, due to low tides, civilian freighters coming to Shanghai from various places were congested, blocking traffic three times in succession. From the Banqiao Xinqiao Candle Factory to the Lao Zha Bridge, the river was blocked by ships, preventing civilian freighters from traveling to and from the area for over ten days. At the height of the congestion, even American wheat freighters carrying barges could not load or unload. Subsequently, the water police took measures to drive them away, and inland river steamers changed their routes to the outer rivers. After several days of dredging, navigation resumed on the 20th. Freighters blocked outside and civilian freighters stuck in Laogang have begun to resume traffic yesterday. Many small steamers from various places have also changed their routes to the inner harbor lines.</p>
<p>Freezing Inland: Shanghai has experienced unusually cold weather in recent days, with temperatures dropping sharply and falling to around 20 degrees at night. The highest temperature is also around 37-38 degrees. The climate in Suzhou, Wuxi, Liyang, and Changzhou is even colder than in Shanghai. Reports received in this city yesterday indicated that inland rivers north of Suzhou are covered in thick ice, making navigation for small steamers extremely difficult. Although the waterways have not been completely frozen, small steamers passing through the area are already breaking the ice to proceed, causing delays in scheduled trips since yesterday. Several scheduled trips failed to arrive in Shanghai yesterday. However, according to Yuantong Company and others, the blocked small steamers should be able to reach Shanghai today. As for steamers traveling on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to Huzhou and other places, they are operating normally without any problems.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Two Firecracker Workshops Exploded <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>White Smoke Filled the Air, Sounds Like a String of Pearls</p>
<p>Three Injured, One False Alarm</p>
<p>Tang Bohai, a 39-year-old from Taizhou, Jiangbei, runs a children's firecracker workshop at 8 Renyifang, Meijia Lane, in the city of Nanshi. Because the Lunar New Year is approaching, the sales of these firecrackers are quite high. Therefore, he recently hired additional workers to work day and night to rush production, so as not to have a shortage of supply during the New Year. Until the night before last, he had produced more than forty plates of firecrackers, totaling about four to five thousand. Because the workshop space was narrow, he temporarily piled them on a table. Unexpectedly, at 6:15 AM yesterday morning, one of the workers accidentally dropped a firecracker on the ground. It made a sharp noise, and sparks ignited the pile of gunpowder raw materials, causing an immediate explosion. With a thunderous sound, over four or five thousand firecrackers exploded simultaneously. The sound was like a string of pearls. At that time, it was just dawn, and nearby residents were awakened from their sleep. At first, they suspected that bandits were shooting to resist arrest. After investigation, they learned the truth. The patrol police of the 1st District, 3rd Precinct, had already reported the incident to the station chief. Chief Jin immediately dispatched a large number of officers to investigate. The sound of the explosion had just subsided, but white smoke filled the surrounding area, shrouding the entire house. It was found that the roof, walls, and mezzanine of the house at number 8 were completely destroyed by the explosion. An eight-year-old child, Xiao Mao, who lived on the mezzanine, suffered serious eye injuries. The front of the Shenchang Copper Shop at numbers 6 and 7 across the street was also blown down. Coppersmiths Zhou Zhengcai and Wu Xiaohu were both injured in the explosion. In addition, the partition walls and mezzanine of number 9 next door also collapsed. Only number 10 suffered minimal damage. After Chief Jin completed his investigation, he took the shop owner, Tang Bohai, into custody for questioning. He also learned that a similar incident occurred at the fuse workshop at noon on the 16th of this month, but it did not cause a major disaster. Chief Jin instructed the police to send the three injured people to the hospital for treatment, pending investigation and punishment.</p>
<p>At around 12:00 PM yesterday morning, a firecracker workshop opened by local Li Yuelin at 5 Xiqing Lane, Sanpailou, in the city, also exploded when a splash of kerosene fell into the firecrackers. Li and his friend Tang Xun were both injured and sent to the hospital for treatment. The 1st District, 2nd Precinct, is currently investigating.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Robbery and Murder at the Zhenyu Goods Factory <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Thirty Bandits Arrived Together</p>
<p>Tang Xiangshou Died from Three Gunshot Wounds</p>
<p>There have been frequent robberies in the Gonghe Xin Road and Zhongxing Road area of Zhabei recently. At 3:45 AM yesterday morning, another robbery occurred at the Zhenyu Goods Factory on the north side of Zhijiangmiao Road, Gonghe Xin Road. The factory owner, Tang Xiangshou, resisted the bandits and was shot three times, resulting in his death. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e154">Factory Inspection <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Zhenyu Goods Factory is located on the north side of Zhijiangmiao Road, Gonghe Xin Road, facing east. The factory site covers more than ten acres, with addresses from 914 to 930, totaling seventeen rooms. The factory buildings number dozens. Apart from the northern municipal housing, half of which is rented out to others to open cloth factories, the southern part is used for operating factories. The south, west, and north sides of the houses are surrounded by very high bamboo fences. Usually, the factory enters and exits through the small gate along the road on the south side. However, the surroundings of the factory, except for the northern cloth factory, are all open space, so the location is very desolate.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Robbery Situation <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>At 3:45 AM yesterday morning, Tang and his family, partners, and apprentices, totaling more than thirty people, were all asleep. Tang was sleeping alone in a small room on the second floor facing south near the road. His sons and daughters-in-law were in the room opposite Tang's small room. The bandits climbed over the bamboo fence on the south side and pried open the second-floor window to enter Tang's bedroom. Tang heard the noise and woke up to see four bandits standing in front of his bed. Tang usually kept a wooden stick beside his bed. Seeing the bandits arrive, he resisted with the wooden stick and shouted loudly. The bandits immediately fired three shots. One shot hit Tang's left hand, with the bullet exiting from the palm. One shot hit next to his left nipple, with the bullet exiting from his back. One shot hit his left waist, with the bullet remaining in his abdomen. He immediately fell to the floor in a pool of blood. Seeing that they had killed the owner, the bandits immediately overturned boxes and cages, robbing dozens of silver dollars. Still dissatisfied, they went to Tang's daughter-in-law's bedroom to search. Tang's daughter-in-law happened to be in confinement after childbirth. Seeing that she was wearing a gold ring on her hand, they took it off her finger. Downstairs, they saw nothing else worth taking, so they opened the front door and fled. When Tang's family discovered what had happened, they ran to the Tanjiaqiao Branch of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau to report. Police were dispatched to investigate, but the bandits were nowhere to be found. Subsequently, the station reported the situation to the Fourth District, instructing Wang Shaoting, the local constable of the Second Tu, to report to the Shanghai Local Court and request an autopsy.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Autopsy Process <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>At around 3:00 PM, the court dispatched prosecutor Li Fen, accompanied by a clerk and forensic staff, to the scene. It was determined that the deceased, Tang Xiangshou (the constable reported Tang Xiangyou), had indeed been shot and killed. The coroner filled out the corpse form and handed it over to the deceased's family for collection, pending the arrest of the murderers.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Brief Biography of the Deceased <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Tang Xiangshou was from Dinghai and was fifty years old. He had two sons. The eldest son, Zhencang, is married and works at the Commercial Press. The second son is Zhenhan. Tang himself opened the Deren Paper Mill at 914 Nan Shan Li, Gonghe Road, Zhabei. Because Tang was good at business, he accumulated great wealth over the years. He also had frequent dealings with a certain foreigner due to business relationships. The factory's Zhenyu Goods Distribution Office is located at Wuma Road, Public Concession. As for the truth behind this murder, it is still unclear.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Four Righteous Men Making Trouble for Four Female Performers <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Trouble Caused by Righteous Men at Pudong Grand Theater</p>
<p>Various Anecdotes from the "Spinning Cotton" Play</p>
<p>Since the Pudong Grand Theater on Yi Du Road, Pudong, hired the entire cast of male and female actors from the former Gengxin Stage to perform the continuous play "Journey to the West," the audience has been filling the theater every day. Among them are four female performers, Zhang Yuqin, Zhou Yanqiu, Mei Yanfang, and Bi Yuezhu, who are all excellent in both appearance and acting skills. They play the role of fairies in the play and are quite beautiful. At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, four people identifying themselves as "righteous men" suddenly delivered four complimentary tickets, which were handed over to Zhou Zhiliang, the ticket seller of the theater, to be passed on to the four performers, inviting them to a banquet at the nearby Da Zhonghua Restaurant. The four performers, upon receiving this strange note, were unsure who these so-called "righteous men" were. They all ignored it. After about an hour, the so-called "righteous men" sent someone to the theater to urge them. The families of the four female performers believed that they were young and should not engage in unnecessary social interactions. Bi Yuezhu's father replied on the invitation note refusing the invitation. The inviters became angry out of humiliation. They first got drunk at the restaurant and then went to the theater together. They booked eleven private boxes, sat down, and made trouble. Every time any one of the four female performers went on stage, the eleven of them would either shout "Bravo!" in strange voices or hurl filthy abuse. The director of the theater, Gu Shuren, tried to persuade them to stop, but they would not listen. He reported to the 3rd District Police Station, which sent officers to post notices on the walls prohibiting shouting "Bravo!" However, the noise continued as before, with no effect. After the play ended late at night, these eleven people still lingered and would not leave. When the four female performers came out, they all shouted abusive remarks, claiming that they would "give them something to see in three days." The four performers were panicked. The incident was learned by Zhang Mingqin, the district chief of the 3rd District. Believing that these people were causing trouble in the theater, affecting the theater's business, and disturbing public order, he sent police to investigate the Da Zhonghua Restaurant. It was learned that Zhou Qilin (31 years old), a Dongtai native working as a translator at the Taikoo Huatong Warehouse, was the ringleader, gathering Wang Yuelou, nicknamed "Little Wang," who works at a foreign company, and others, to deliberately provoke the four female performers. The reason was that when a certain performer sang "Spinning Cotton" a few days ago, Zhou happened to be watching from the audience. When the wife in the play said that her husband had been away for three years and returned to find her holding a child, the husband asked his wife who the child belonged to. The wife replied that it was raised by the neighbor, A San. Upon hearing this, Zhou stood up and shouted, "The neighbor, A San, is me!" This one sentence caused the entire audience to burst into laughter. The performer was quite quick-witted and turned the tables on Zhou, saying that the neighbor A San was the child she was holding. Zhou was speechless and turned red in the face before leaving. Afterwards, he gathered his friends to take revenge. District Chief Zhang believed that his molestation of the female performer was extremely hateful. That night, he sent police to Zhou's residence at 3 Mujia Ferry, took Zhou to the district, and summoned Zhou Zhiliang, the ticket seller, to testify. The district chief severely reprimanded him and sentenced him to fifteen days of detention as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e159">12th National YMCA Convention to Open Today <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The 12th National Convention of the Chinese Young Men's Christian Association will be held at 7:30 PM tonight (23rd) at St. John's University. Mr. Wang Zhengting will deliver the opening address, the topic of which is (The Meaning of Collaboration). On the second night, Mr. ... will be the speaker, and the topic will be "Cooperation between Adults and Young People." On the third night, Mr. Tao Zhihang will be the speaker, and the topic will be "Cooperation and Rural Construction." On the fourth night, Mr. Shi Qiang, a representative of the World YMCA, will speak, and the topic will be "International Cooperation." The overall theme of this convention is "Cooperative Nation Building." Therefore, all speeches will focus on cooperation. The YMCA deeply feels that our country has not paid attention to the concept of cooperation, and the reason why all industries are not prosperous and the national soul is not revitalized is due to the lack of cooperation. Therefore, the National YMCA will do its best to promote "cooperation" in the next three or four years, so that our country can move towards the road of revival. It is also heard that representatives from YMCA branches across the country have gathered in Shanghai and will depart from the YMCA branches at Baxianqiao and Sichuan Road together to St. John's University at 3:00 PM today.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Shanghai National Products Company Implements Second Plan <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Completing the Work of Creating Purchasing Power</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Company, located across from the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road, has been experiencing increased business since the early implementation of its second plan. Starting from January 6th, in order to promote the "Women's National Products Year" campaign, in addition to a uniform 10% discount on all goods, it also selects low-priced and high-quality national products every morning, with a specified time and department allocation method, to introduce sacrificial promotions to women. Not only are the prices unprecedentedly low, but the exquisite quality of the goods is also widely praised. As a result, women from all walks of life who love national products are rushing to visit in the mornings. There is a tendency to concentrate the original afternoon purchasing power in the morning. Sometimes the prepared low-priced and high-quality goods are not enough to supply demand, so goods vouchers are issued to ensure that no customer who arrives during the limited time is disappointed, thus further enhancing its reputation. According to Mr. Ren Jinping of the company, attracting purchasing power and creating purchasing power are the secrets of running a business. This time, the company does not hesitate to make significant sacrifices, not only to arouse the concept of loving national products among women, but also to create morning purchasing power. The work of creating time-based purchasing power as defined in the second plan can be said to have been completed.</p>

<p>Originated from the Idea of Fugitive Bandit Leader Chen A'liu</p>
<p>Days Spent Observing His Appearance and Movements</p>
<p>Bandits Initially Demanded a Ransom of 300,000</p>
<p>Two Negotiations Yielded No Satisfactory Results</p>
<p>| Court Hearing Postponed to Reschedule After Seven Days |</p>
<p>Steel tycoon He Boyan, who lives at 4 Donghua Lane, Xizang Road, was kidnapped at 10:15 AM on December 27th of last year. He had just left his home and boarded his private car when he was suddenly ambushed by kidnappers. The kidnappers sent a letter demanding a huge ransom. Chief Inspector Shao Jingfan and detectives Wang Youshan, Liang Yuliang, Tao Afu, and Gao Yuqing of the Huizhong Police Department successively apprehended Zhang Aqin and 17 other male and female kidnappers at the Tongyi Hotel on Beihai Road and 1 Zhongde Lane, Longhua Xiaomuqiao Road, on the 13th of this month. He Boyan was rescued, and a pistol and seven bullets were confiscated. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. It was ordered that the defendants Zhang Aqin, Yang Aqin, Zhang Azhang, Gu Afu (Gu Deming), Yang Shanli, Ji Deming, Lu Yingfan, Huang Jinlong, Zhang Dexing, Tao Changshan, Lu Asan, and 11 others be detained, Gu Daishi and Liu Xiaomao were released on bail, and Zhou Guilin, Su Xiaomei, Lu Shishi, Zhu Xiuying, and Wang Fenggui were released as they were found to have no involvement in the case. It has now been learned that the police</p>
<h3 id="e164">Completed the Investigation Procedures <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Therefore, this morning, all those in custody were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Defendants Huang Jinlong and Gu Afu hired attorney Fan Gang to represent them in court. Police attorney Jiang Baolian rose to declare that it has been found that defendant Tao Changlin is also not involved in the case and should be released. The court approved this request. Attorney Jiang then detailed the investigation of the case over the past week, stating that the Municipal Council, with the exception of Yang Shanli, is prosecuting all reports under Article 371, Section 1 of the Criminal Code, kidnapping for ransom, and Article 1 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. Yang Shanli, as a tea server at the Tongyi Hotel, is suspected of providing information and is therefore charged with helping to kidnap and extort money. All defendants confessed to the kidnapping in the police station, and their statements have been recorded. The escaped bandit leader Chen A'liu, alias Xiaomao Yujintao, is quite friendly with Gu Afu. Three months before the incident, Chen and Gu met in Baxianqiao. Chen said that he had been having bad luck gambling recently and had incurred heavy debts that he could not repay. He wanted to</p>
<h3 id="e165">Conduct a Kidnapping for Ransom <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>If he could get the ransom money, he could not only pay off his debts but also get a huge amount of money for himself. Gu listened and expressed his agreement. Chen then instructed Gu to go to the Tongyi Hotel on Beihai Road with him. There, they saw the defendants Zhang Aqin, Yang Aqin, Ji Deming, Zhang Dexing, and Lu Asan. They then began a meeting. As a result, they all agreed to the kidnapping. Chen A'liu revealed that the victim's name was He Boyan, who was very wealthy and traveled by car, and was worth a large sum of money. If they did not believe him, they could go to the door of the Far Eastern Hotel the next morning (to identify his appearance). After the discussion, they dispersed. The next morning, ... they were divided near the Far Eastern Hotel. They saw a car with the license plate number 3496 parked at the entrance of the alley. Chen A'liu said to the defendant Lu Asan, "Can you drive this kind of Morris car?" Lu replied that he could. Shortly after, a young man in a suit (He Boyan, the victim in this case) came out of the alley and got into the car. Chen said to Gu, "That's He Boyan."</p>
<h3 id="e166">Are You Seeing Clearly? <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Then they dispersed immediately. Ten days later, these people opened room number 218 at the Far Eastern Hotel. The signatory was Zhang Dexing. This location was conveniently located opposite the Donghua Lane where the victim, He Boyan, lived, thus allowing them to observe He Boyan's every move. They stayed for about two nights, but due to the high expenses, they couldn't afford it. They then changed to the Unified Hotel, registered under the name of Gu Deming in the circulation book. At the same time, they continued to send people to secretly investigate He's movements every day. Later, they moved to room number 20 in the Shenzhou Hotel and held another meeting, deciding to take action on December 27th.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Preparing to Carry Out the Kidnapping <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>They prepared a letter in advance, addressed to He's father, which roughly stated, "Your son has now joined our party and is being treated very well, please rest assured." They handed it over to Lu Asan for safekeeping and appointed Lu as the driver. Chen then took out three guns, and Zhang Aqing, Yang Aqing, and Ji Deming each took one. At nine o'clock on the morning of the 27th, they all departed from Shenzhou.</p>
<p>Zhang and Ji stood to the left and right of the entrance to Donghua Lane, while Yang and Lu guarded the opposite side. Chen took on the role of patrolling the road. Around ten o'clock, He Boyan left his house and just got into his car. The group immediately stepped forward, threatening him with guns and forbidding him from making any noise. Lu Asan, as the driver, and Ji Deming supervised He's chauffeur, sitting in the front. In the back were the defendants Zhang Aqing and Yang Aqing, who watched over He Boyan. They started the engine and sped forward. After traveling about sixty yards, Lu handed the prepared letter to He's chauffeur and kicked him out. They drove from the French Concession into the Chinese territory, stopping at Small Wooden Bridge Road. At that time, Chen Aliù was already waiting there, with a rickshaw and a cotton quilt prepared. They immediately carried He onto the rickshaw, covering him with the quilt. If they were questioned along the way, they could claim that</p>
<h3 id="e168">The Person in the Quilt is a Patient <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Who was going to Shanghai for medical treatment, thus avoiding trouble. Later, the rickshaw arrived at Shende Lane. They got out of the rickshaw and entered the alley, helping him into the pavilion room inside the bandit den at number one. They assigned people to guard him, taking turns without rest. After several days, they forced He Boyan to write a letter to his family demanding a ransom. He then wrote a letter to his colleague, He Zhengxiang, asking him to help negotiate. The gang then notified He Zhengxiang by phone, arranging a meeting on the Bund, using a newspaper as a sign. However, He forgot to bring the newspaper, so they didn't meet. Later, they changed the meeting place to the entrance of Jing'an Temple. The defendants Zhang Aqing and Yang Aqing went to meet He and</p>
<h3 id="e169">Demanded a Ransom of 300,000 <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Yuan. He said that He Boyan's family was not wealthy and could not raise such a huge sum. If it was around 10,000 yuan, they could find a way. Because the two sides were too far apart, there was no result, and they dispersed. It wasn't until the 13th of this month that the police cracked the case, rescued the hostage, and seized dark glasses and all the evidence. Now the case has been investigated and concluded, but there is fear that there may be other cases, so they requested permission to postpone the trial again, etc. Then they presented the seized evidence of guns and ammunition to the court. After Judge Xue Lanru questioned the witnesses, including the tea servant of the Unified Hotel, he ordered all the defendants to be returned to custody to await another trial in seven days.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Verdict on the Petty Daily Accusation Case <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Defendant Huang Guangyi is Not Guilty</p>
<p>The Petty Daily in this city has been published for eight years. Unexpectedly, recently, due to the publication of a long novel, "The Secrets of the Liquor Market," Huang Guangyi, who is financially responsible for the newspaper, was sued by Kuang Yanqi, a fellow townsman who runs a foreign liquor store. The case was heard by Judge Qiu Huan'ying of the Second Special District Court, and two hearings were held on the 13th and 18th of this month. Huang hired three lawyers, Luo Jiaheng, Tang Mingshi, and You Zhi, for defense. Kuang Yanqi claimed that the novel "The Secrets of the Liquor Market" published in the Petty Daily contained the protagonist Guang Asan, also known as Yanqi, who runs the Xingjian Liquor Store, and various family secrets and scandals, which in fact alluded to his name and family history. After publishing dozens of chapters, he entrusted his relative, Jin, to mediate unsuccessfully. Later, he received a letter from Jin stating that he wanted me to donate 500 yuan for charitable donations and publish an apology in the newspaper, etc. He presented Jin's letter as evidence and also filed a private lawsuit through a lawyer, seeking compensation for losses and requesting the court to issue an emergency injunction to order the Petty Daily to immediately cease publishing this novel. However, Kuang stated during the first hearing that everything described in "The Secrets of the Liquor Market" was based on his own facts, but during the second hearing, he claimed that there were no such facts, etc. Huang Guangyi stated during the first hearing that the Petty Daily's text was managed by the editorial department, and the editor-in-chief was You Yi'an. The source of the novel should be questioned from the editor-in-chief. Regarding Jin's mediation, he knew nothing about it. This Jin is Kuang's relative by marriage, and he hasn't seen him for two years. There has been no correspondence during these two years, so how could this have happened? It is clear that Kuang and Jin colluded to frame him. Regarding this letter, please have the court keep it on file, and he will pursue it according to the law. You Yi'an also stated that "The Secrets of the Liquor Market" was the work of the contributor Zhu Taibai. As a novelist, how could he possibly fabricate and forcibly point to allusions? As the editor-in-chief of the Petty Daily, he also reviewed the manuscript and knew that it was a fictional work and had no effect at all, so he published it. If it is as Kuang said, then if someone wants to make things difficult for a novelist in the future, they only need to admit that they are the person described in their writing, and they can file a lawsuit. Then the novelist's castles in the air and playful writing will be in danger of facing criminal charges at any time, etc. The defendants' agents, Tang Mingshi and You Zhi, also used their eloquence to request a verdict of not guilty for Huang Guangyi based on legal facts and to dismiss the private lawsuit attached by the plaintiff. Judge Qiu announced that the verdict would be announced on the morning of the 22nd, and Kuang Yanqi's second request to stop publishing the novel was not approved. At ten o'clock yesterday morning, Judge Qiu ascended to the criminal court and announced the verdict, ruling Huang Guangyi not guilty and dismissing the civil lawsuit attached by Kuang Yanqi. It is reported that Huang Guangyi has filed a private lawsuit against Kuang Yanqi for filing a lawsuit without cause, fabricating evidence, and damaging his reputation, requesting that Kuang be punished for the crimes he deserves. The trial should begin soon.</p>

<p>Yesterday at around 3:20 PM, two bandits suddenly came to a certain family's home at No. 364 Tangshan Road. One bandit had a pistol, and the other guarded the door. They first locked all the people in the house in one room and then began to search separately. However, this family had no savings, so they were only robbed of 80 yuan in paper money and then fled. Afterwards, the victim reported to the competent police station requesting an investigation.</p>

<p>The cigarette and paper shop established by Qi Guangrong of Taixing at No. 105 Yangshupu Road was suddenly invaded by three bandits at about 8 o'clock the night before. One held a fake pistol to scare the shop assistants and prevent them from making noise, and two others were on the lookout outside. They were robbed of</p>
<p>Paper money and silver coins, totaling eighteen yuan. As a result, Qi captured one of the bandits and frantically blew the police whistle. Chinese detective Zhou Kaiwen arrived and took him to the Huishan Police Station. Upon interrogation, he confessed that his name was Wang Desheng (from Qingkou). A fake pistol was found in his bag. The police chief ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division 3 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the defendant admitted at the police station that he came to Shanghai from Pudong and met two fugitives, Zhang Da and Da Lazi. Da Lazi gave him a fake pistol and they went to rob together. These two were the two bandits on the lookout. The wooden fake gun was presented for inspection. Then, according to the victim Qi Guangrong's description of the incident, he was questioned by the defendant, who suddenly recanted, saying that everything he confessed at the police station was nonsense. He and Qi Guangrong had known each other for a long time. He specialized in buying small goods from thieves in the Huangpu River and often hired his boat to transport them. Recently, he bought a large amount of broadcloth, beer, and other items, which he also helped to load, promising to give him a large sum of money. Therefore, he went to settle accounts with him at that time, and a dispute arose. He was accused of being a robber. He spoke eloquently and cried out for injustice, asking the court to see clearly. Qi Guangrong claimed that he did not know him and denied everything. Police lawyer Wang stated that according to the defendant's confession, everything was vividly described. For the sake of caution in this case, he requested that Wang and Qi be jointly detained for detailed investigation, etc. Judge Liu Yugui approved this and ordered the case to be adjourned for investigation and verification.</p>

<p>Tianzhang Printing Bureau Adds a Retail Department. Tianzhang Printing Bureau is located inside the Tianzhang Paper Mill at the east end of Dalian Bay Road, Yangshupu Road. Since its opening, it has been more than a year, and the business is very developed. It uses all domestic paper produced by Tianzhang Paper Mill for printing. General patriotic factories, companies, and domestic goods companies all go to wholesale. Finished products such as Chinese and Western-style stationery, envelopes, patriotic stationery, practice books, etc., as well as custom-printed documents and books, are very popular. However, the bureau has always been wholesale and has not set up a retail department, so compatriots who love domestic goods have no way to purchase them, which is inevitable regret. Now, a retail department has been added to the east end of the original site. It has now been renovated and will be opened soon so that stores, factories, and schools in eastern Shanghai can contact nearby. As for the merchants who are far away, if you want to print documents, you can notify by telephone number 50238, and someone will be sent to contact you immediately.

<p>｜Reply to Mr. Huang Xiuzhong｜</p>
<p>If, as stated in your letter, your purpose in studying history is "to understand the past conditions of present society, so that I may understand why present society is the way it is," and you further wish not to become a "history expert," then undoubtedly the research steps in your plan are unsuitable. Because the approach you are taking is precisely the method of entry for experts, which is unnecessary for the average person. In other words, you don't need to go so far. For the purpose you have, there is another correct research path.</p>
<p>The shortcomings of the research steps you have taken have already been mentioned in your letter, but these are only preliminary, difficulties in terms of material conditions. As for whether you can truly achieve your goal and avoid the problems of "disorder and lack of system" even if you continue to research in this way with great effort, you have not considered it. However, we dare to predict that this situation is inevitable and will only make you feel more unable to research. Because learning must first have a correct method, and without this, one is bound to be "dazzled" and "unable to focus."</p>
<p>If your purpose in studying history is truly as stated in your letter, then we would like to offer another approach.</p>
<p>What you wish to know is the current practical activities of society, and therefore you want to study the development process of human practice. We believe that you do not need to go around in circles, studying from ancient times to the recent past, but rather you should start studying from the recent past and trace back to ancient times. Because if you proceed from top to bottom, you will first spend a lot of time solving many tool-related obstacles. From the perspective of someone who does not engage in specialized research, this is very uneconomical. But this is only uneconomical. If you waste a lot of time and the obstacles still exist, you might abandon the desire to read due to choking, which is not only uneconomical but simply a waste. Moreover, the more ancient the era, the less the influence on later generations and the simpler the relationships. Therefore, the study of ancient times is time-consuming and yields little benefit, which is very uneconomical for amateur self-learners.</p>
<p>In addition, your goal in studying history is only to gain a deeper understanding of reality, which can be achieved by starting research from reality. When you encounter something whose cause-and-effect relationship is unclear, then you can trace back to its cause. Therefore, we believe that when you begin your preliminary research, you can first study various problems. For example, if you wish to study political history, you do not need to start by reading books like *Zizhi Tongjian*. Instead, you should start with various recently occurring facts that you have seen and heard, such as the political situation in recent years, the Northern Expedition of the Kuomintang, Cao Kun's bribery, and then trace back to the Xinhai Revolution. By examining the origins and causal relationships in these events, your concepts will naturally be more accurate and clearer. This method can save a lot of energy for us amateurs. We do not advocate using a vertical method for reading but a horizontal method. This is not only our advocacy for history but for any subject. Because if you study from the present to the past, it is a gradual method of progressing from shallow to deep, peeling back layers. Moreover, phenomena that are close to current life are also the easiest to feel interested in when studying. In amateur self-study, reading is often interrupted. If you use a "horizontal" method, it is like making a small tool; you complete one when you make one. The vertical method is different; it is like a large project, and you cannot achieve success until you have worked for a considerable period. Therefore, for general readers, we strongly hope that they adopt this method, and even those who want to do specialized research can gain many conveniences by starting with this method and then doing further research. Mr. Lü Simian said, "In theory, reading the history of later generations must trace its origins to ancient times in order to truly understand it. In fact, reading ancient history requires the history of later generations as a comparison in order to feel it is easy to understand." This is indeed the experience of studying history, and it is the path that beginners should take.</p>
<p>You can now be said to have a slight foundation in history (because you have already read many outlines of history and similar books). Therefore, our opinion on your future reading plan is that you do not need to study history for the time being but rather study methodology, because the difficulty you are currently feeling is that you feel these books cannot satisfy your desire for knowledge. However, these books are mostly not insufficient in material but rather incorrect in viewpoint. Therefore, you should first study methodology. After you have a rough understanding of this, you will have a central idea of your own. Then you can use this central idea to identify all theories and analyze and study all phenomena without wandering down the wrong path. ｜｜Kang</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Sheng Yuliao, the former manager of the Sanxin Cotton Mill, who was shocked to read in today's newspaper about the Sanxin Cotton Mill workers' representatives declaring a hunger strike. The Tongshan Hall attached to the former Sanxin Cotton Mill was originally a charitable organization, and its annual expenses were often insufficient, relying on donations from the cotton mill for support. In the spring of 1931, when the Sanxin Cotton Mill was sold, I handed over all my duties and, according to the order of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, handed over all the assets of the Tongshan Hall, including more than 14 mu of land for burial, current funds of 1,923.90 yuan, and some materials. I immediately complied. Afterwards, I heard that the labor union organized by the workers in the factory had already submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau in April 1931, requesting a disposition. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau took this measure. Thus, my compliance with the order to hand over the assets was not only an administrative disposition by the Social Affairs Bureau but also the result of a petition by the workers' union. However, afterwards, some workers filed a criminal complaint against me for embezzlement in the First Special District Court. The court ruled that the case should be decided based on civil relations and transferred it to the Civil Division for trial. Later, the Civil Division held several hearings, and the workers requested an audit of the accounts. The court has appointed an accountant to audit the accounts, and both parties should wait for the court to resolve the matter. This is the true course of the case. The reports in the newspapers that there were large sums of money and a bail of 120,000 yuan in the Criminal Division are all fabricated and do not correspond to the facts. Yesterday morning, seven people claiming to be workers' representatives suddenly came to my residence. When they knocked on the door, they falsely claimed to be tailors and talked about the lawsuit. I replied peacefully and advised them to wait for the court's judgment. They still refused to leave. Later, the police intervened because they violated police regulations. I still believe that the workers were temporarily ignorant of the facts and did not harbor any resentment. However, today I saw in the newspaper that they exaggerated their claims and sensationalized the matter, and used inaccurate language to make veiled accusations, which is difficult to ignore. I have specially commissioned your esteemed lawyer to send a letter to various newspapers for correction, to set the record straight, and other matters. It is hoped that your esteemed newspaper will publish the original letter to clarify the matter. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Lawyer Cai Liucheng, January 22.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Boredom <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>Chinese people mostly like to talk about the weather when they meet, otherwise they can find a lot to say about "three meals a day"; this seems to have become a formula that can be applied everywhere.</p>
<p>Some people say this is "boring." Yes! Chinese people originally lived in "boredom", let alone now that we have encountered such a boring year!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday on Avenue Joffre, I inadvertently ran into a friend. The weather was very cloudy and humid that day, so after complaining about the weather, I asked him what he had been doing lately. He said a lot of the suffering he felt due to boredom.</p>
<p>I felt very regretful at the time. Because in this year of national chaos and people's livelihood is insecure, although there is no need to raise the whip of "national crisis" to force young people to embark on the path of struggle; but it is really unreasonable to force precious time under the name of "entertainment"! So I also felt a kind of boredom! We broke up in this boredom.</p>
<p>After I was squeezed onto the tram by many passengers like vicious criminals, regarding the question of why young people are so bored, perhaps because it is too serious, I couldn't investigate it for a while. At the same time, because my friend, although middle-aged, is still a "virgin", it reminded me of a "tragedy" many years ago.</p>
<p>There was a man and a woman who didn't know each other but studied in Beiping. I don't know why, but the man felt bored and the woman also felt bored; so, they often went to "Central Park" to run around without consulting each other. Soon, they gradually became closer, and they both felt they "had something". This can be said to be the end of everything. Because after another "soon", they still returned to "boredom" and finally sank into Kunming Lake and "died"!</p>
<p>The Classic of Mountains and Seas once said: "Ephemera fall to the ground and die after mating." According to this, the reason why "Ephemera" in the world are not extinct is that they must mate and think they have fulfilled their responsibilities before falling to the ground and dying. If Chinese people could become Ephemera, then not only could they be free from all boredom, but the world would be easier to save!</p>
<p>However, since it is called "man," the spirit of all things, his responsibility is certainly not as simple as that of an Ephemera. What is the responsibility of modern youth? Why do they feel bored? If the first question can be solved appropriately, the second question will not arise. Although they also feel the imperfection of social organization and the difficulty of the way out, and cannot avoid the attack of boredom; but this is still because the first question has not been "appropriately" solved.</p>
<p>If what they feel is a kind of "Ephemera-style" boredom, then it is not only the destruction of the youth itself, but also an irreparable loss to the country!</p>
<p>I always feel that Chinese people lack the spirit of "hard work" in various undertakings, and the call of "boredom" rushes out in the gaps of this spirit!</p>

<p>The lanterns here are not the paper lanterns released on the fifteenth night of the lunar New Year, like rotating lanterns and rabbit lanterns. These lanterns shine every night of the 365 days of the year, indicating that they are decorations of the metropolis and a buffer zone in the tense atmosphere. But its role is exactly the same as paper rotating lanterns and rabbit lanterns. At the same time, taking advantage of the excitement, some novelties for people to enjoy have occupied a certain section in Shanghai and become a special area under its sphere of influence!</p>
<p>"What exactly is the novelty?"</p>
<p>"Where is the special area?"</p>
<p>Let me tell you - this special area is bordered by Zhejiang Road, Sixth Malu, Tibet Road, and Third Malu. Xiaohuayuan, Fuyu, Fuxiang, and Fuzhili are its main bases, and Qunyufang, Sanyuanfang, and Huilieli are its colonies. The atoms of the novelty are pink women. Chinese people have always called them "flowers." "Lanterns" are all kinds of things that use electricity to emit light. Merchants are used to using them as advertising tools. Smart "flowers" mark their own flower names on the "lanterns," relying on its colorfulness to attract some men to watch the lanterns. "The interpretation of watching lanterns is as such!"</p>
<p>"As long as you have money, it doesn't matter if they are strangers or acquaintances." These two sentences are a traditional policy of the "lantern flowers" to deal with the "lantern players." So the good lanterns are separated from the public and are only appreciated by those with big bellies and round faces! The remaining sour scholars often have to pass through this so-called special area. The "lantern" is still visible to you, but what about the "flower"? Except for occasionally smelling a nauseating smell naturally broadcast from it, don't have any other thoughts.</p>

<p>In the past, there was a scholar who had just been appointed magistrate of a certain county. When he was about to take office, he went to his teacher's house to say goodbye as usual. His teacher said to him: "The gentry of a certain county are very cunning. You are an official for the first time. What do you rely on when you go there?"</p>
<p>"I just rely on my own knowledge." The scholar answered without hesitation.</p>
<p>"What's the use of knowledge?" His teacher shook his head repeatedly.</p>
<p>"I brought one hundred and twenty high hats." The scholar then told his teacher.</p>
<p>"What's the use of high hats?" His teacher still shook his head repeatedly.</p>
<p>"The teacher's prestige is known to everyone. I will tell them that I am the teacher's student, and they will naturally take care of me." The scholar changed his tone.</p>
<p>"That's okay..." His teacher immediately stopped shaking his head and smiled slightly.</p>
<p>"Teacher! I only have one hundred and nineteen high hats left now." The scholar told his teacher tightly.</p>
<p>"Why is there one less?" His teacher asked in a daze.</p>
<p>"That one was put on the teacher's head." The scholar also smiled slightly.</p>
<p>This kind of high hat has been loved by everyone since ancient times, and now it seems to be more fashionable. Some people, in order to decorate their own ugliness, do not hesitate to snatch this kind of hat from other people's heads and put it on their own heads. This clearly tells us that high hats have now become priceless treasures, and knowing how to give people high hats seems to be an essential skill in life now.</p>

<p>Authority of Marriage</p>
<p>Don't look down on this nonsense and eye-closing gentleman (because he is blind, he goes to fortune-telling, but fortune-tellers are not necessarily blind, but mostly use this as a guise to lure wealth and lust). He really holds the authority in life and marriage. No matter how like-minded and sympathetic you are, he can easily break up a pair of lovebirds with a few words. I don't know how many estranged men and women in the world are made by his sweet words. There is a manipulator in the emotional sky and the sea of ​​hate. Fortunately, good men and women are obedient, and they always listen to him. Even if something unfortunate happens in the future, it is destined in the previous life and has nothing to do with others. He is an expert in bringing together estranged couples. If you want no estranged couples in the world, the initial task is to overthrow astrology.</p>

<p>Chapter 23: The Pain is Unbearable, Concentrating on Listening to the Music, and the Joy is Not Satisfied, the Departure is Hasty, and the Flying Talisman Arrives</p>
<p>Not only Zhao's family was about to start being busy, but Yang's family also became busy. After Zhao Ziqiang returned home, he also met Guizhi twice. Because Guizhi was about to become a bride, if she talked to Ziqiang in front of people, she was afraid that the visiting relatives and friends would see it and make some jokes, so she only glanced at Ziqiang, indicating that I knew you were back, and still avoided it. Ziqiang originally thought about finding an opportunity to say a few words to Guizhi, but then he thought that he was about to get married. What can I talk about in the honeymoon, I can talk about what I am busy with now? So when he saw Guizhi, if there was someone, he looked at Guizhi and that's it. If there was no one, he smiled softly and said: You should be busy these few days. Is there anything I want you to prepare for me? Guizhi naturally smiled and said no. In addition, the two had no contact. But Guizhi's heart was carrying a question at this time. Like the relatives and friends in the family, busy coming and going, what did Gan Jiwu, who lived across the street, think? Because the mother was very suspicious of this matter, it was naturally inconvenient to ask. Apart from the mother, if she asked the second person, it would lead to suspicion even more, so although she couldn't help but feel puzzled, she just puzzled. But he was thinking right, Jizhi had not returned to Haitien, so he didn't have to worry too much about his situation. When he returned to Haitien, he happened to have met Guizhi and saw that a ray of her heart was still attached to him and had not changed. In addition, the second step, Guizhi suddenly disappeared, clearly putting him in a quiet place. If he wanted to avoid me, then when he saw me that time, he shouldn't have been so affectionate. When he was hesitating, he saw that the Zhao family's door was suddenly crowded with people coming in and out, and he was a little surprised, so he often walked outside the door and looked at the situation across the street.

<p>Modern women are often troubled by being overweight, which not only reduces the beauty of their appearance, but also makes their hearts and breathing very uncomfortable due to their obesity. Other related problems such as arteriosclerosis and high blood pressure also occur. At worst, they suddenly suffer from dangerous diseases such as heart paralysis and cerebral hemorrhage, and even suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis, resulting in death. Also, due to obesity, the reproductive organs are obstructed, the liver becomes abnormal, and secondary diseases such as neuritis and diabetes will continue to occur. Although obese people have relatively few germs, once an infectious disease occurs, it is easier to spread than in thin people. Therefore, the mortality rate of obese people worldwide is higher than that of thin people. Ordinary physiques absorb fat in April and May, and gradually become thinner in summer. If obese people eat too much fatty food in winter, the amount of fat increases, and they suffer even more in summer. Moreover, because of obesity, the original aesthetic sense is taken away, especially for young women, which must be paid great attention to. Recently, the number of obese women in the leisure class in Europe and the United States has increased year by year. Now the fat center theory has been invented. This disease is more common in Chinese women than in Europeans and Americans, because they often eat starchy top-grade rice, and their fat gradually increases. Therefore, obese women must not eat too much food containing too much fat during the season when their appetite increases in winter, such as meat, refined rice, and foods with too much oil. That can inhibit the development of the thyroid gland, because obese people do not eat much fatty food in winter, and the development principle of body metabolism can gradually flourish in the following spring and summer without being hindered. In particular, pay attention to exercise to reduce excess fat and revitalize its development function, so that the feeling of height and weight gradually becomes balanced, which is really an essential element to promote health and beauty.</p>
<h3 id="e196">How Thin Women Can Get Fat <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Chuyu</p>
<p>It is true that women's bodies that are too obese reduce their sense of beauty, but it is also unsightly to be as thin as a stick. Now I have brought out the experimental fattening method, please try it out with thin women. (1) Chicken bone soup is good for thinness. Use a chicken bone frame every day, which must have the bones of the whole body, and boil it into soup with green vegetables (simmer it with a simmer until the bones are crispy), add a little salt, and drink it three times. It is very delicious and very nourishing. If you continue to eat it for half a month, you will only eat fifteen chickens, which will cost you less than ten yuan, and it can prove to be effective. If you can get Silkie chickens, it will be even more effective, but your mind and body must be quiet, and you must not be irritable, and then add appropriate exercise, then your body will achieve considerable health and beauty. (2) Binding the abdomen to make you fat. Women who are generally willow-like often suffer from neurasthenia, indigestion, constipation, insomnia and other symptoms. If you want to get fat, you can use a cloth six feet long and five inches wide and tie it tightly to the lower abdomen (below the navel), tie the head to the left, and distribute the posture evenly according to the traction when exercising. Eat more beans, noodles, brown rice, etc. every day, and sit quietly in a balanced posture for ten minutes before going to bed. Then the body will not be harmful if it is too much or insufficient, and you can gradually become healthier. (3) Drinking water and dry cloth friction method. Drink a cup of clear water on an empty stomach every morning, drink two cups at ten o'clock in the morning, drink a cup before lunch, drink two cups at three o'clock in the afternoon, and drink a cup before dinner. The amount and time of drinking every day must be fixed and not early or late. At the same time, rub the whole body twice with a dry cloth when you get up and before going to bed every day. Start rubbing from the back first, then rub the chest, abdomen, hands and feet, until the skin is red. You will get fat in less than a month. (4) Food nutrition and mental life method. Food can absorb nutrients, such as yams, vegetables, noodles, beans, chicken eggs, milk, fish, etc. You must take a certain amount every day, and eat animal meat once every other day. You must not eat too much or too little, and you must have a fixed time. For mental treatment, the first is to keep the mind quiet. The second is to have proper rules in daily life. The third is to fully absorb fresh air. The fourth is to avoid excessive exercise. If you do this, not only ordinary people can increase their health and beauty, but also people with lung disease can be treated. The above four methods are all from experiments, so thin women may wish to try it.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Current Situation of Education in Anhui Province (II) <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>| Inspection Report by Special Commissioner Li Ximou of the Ministry of Education |</p>
<p>(5) The Current Situation of Local Education Funds and Opinions on the Reorganization Plan: After the flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the disaster areas suffered losses. Counties such as Liu'an and Huoshan were also ravaged by bandits, leading to economic bankruptcy and severe damage to education funds. The Department of Education compiled "Statistics on County Education Revenue for the 21st Year of the Republic of China," covering the education funds of 59 counties: (1) School property rent income: 485,912 yuan; (2) Local produce education tax: 134,253 yuan; (3) Various surcharges: 771,596 yuan; (4) Free education surcharge: 771,260 yuan; (5) Subsidies and donations: 33,453 yuan; (6) Miscellaneous items: 77,796 yuan; (7) Temporary income: 473,946 yuan. The total of the above seven items is 2,748,216 yuan. "Statistics on County Education Expenditure for the 21st Year of the Republic of China" show that the education funds of various counties are spent on: (1) Secondary education: 240,539 yuan; (2) Primary education: 973,700 yuan; (3) Vocational education: 365,276 yuan; (4) Subsidies: 10,492 yuan; (5) Social education: 179,058 yuan; (6) Education Bureau expenses:</p>
<p>228,454 yuan; (7) Expenses for various school districts and committees: 45,182 yuan; (8) Miscellaneous expenses: 69,975 yuan; (9) Various temporary expenses: 613,291 yuan. The total of the above nine items is 2,725,976 yuan. In various counties, most of the surcharges are collected on behalf of the county government and other agencies, while school property rents are collected by people sent by the Education Bureau. According to the Fengyang County Education Bureau's report on income and expenditure, "The county education funds collected on behalf of the county government and other agencies are settled monthly by the Education Bureau. The four-part receipt form issued by the Department is used to collect funds. The Education Bureau collects school rents itself, with one director and one collector of school property management handling the matter. Collection and payment are done simultaneously, and the accounting staff of the Bureau settles accounts at the end of the month, filling out the four-part receipt form issued by the Department. As for the disbursement method, at the end of each month, the total amount of funds collected that month is calculated, and free school expenses are prioritized. The remainder is distributed proportionally to general schools and various educational institutions. When receiving funds, a four-part disbursement receipt form issued by the Department must be filled out for reference. A budget is prepared at the beginning of the year as a standard for income and expenditure. At the end of the year, a final account is prepared to serve as a statistic for assessing profit and loss. The actual monthly income and expenditure are calculated monthly and submitted to the county for verification and then forwarded to the Department for record." There are also several difficulties, such as the Fengyang Education Bureau stating, "There are two difficulties in the Education Bureau's management of education funds: (1) County governments inevitably misappropriate funds collected on their behalf. Although the province has repeatedly issued strict orders to remit funds as soon as they are collected without any misappropriation, the effect is still minimal. It is estimated that the five county magistrates, Jiang, Luo, Zhang, Yang, and Shi, have misappropriated a total of 7,900 yuan. Former County Magistrate Yuan also misappropriated more than 1,600 yuan. Although they are all listed as offsets, and the province has ordered that they be recovered and reimbursed from various taxes, there are no concrete measures, and reimbursement remains empty words. (2) Many school properties have been affected by floods, resulting in reduced income, and monthly expenditures are insufficient. Therefore, general education funds can only be distributed proportionally, which is very difficult. (3) Many school properties have not been properly registered by the Education Bureau, and procedures are incomplete, causing property rights to be unstable." The Huaining County Education Bureau stated, "The county education funds come from four items: additional land tax, additional house rent, school rent, and fishing lake and shoal tax. The estimated regular income for this year is 43,486 yuan, but the actual income is likely to be only over 30,000 yuan. This is because rice prices have fallen in recent years, the rural economy has collapsed, and the additional land tax cannot be fully collected. The Education Bureau's school rent is also no exception. In addition, for house rent, most of the residents are from this county and have been living here for a long time, making it inconvenient to increase rents for the time being. As for the fishing lake and shoal tax, the income from the past two years of major floods has only been enough to meet the needs of building embankments, resulting in a shortage of overall education fund income, making it impossible for all educational undertakings to proceed smoothly, which is truly regrettable." Therefore, in order to ensure that local education funds meet the standards of the Ministry of Education, it is necessary to increase revenue and ensure its independence so that local compulsory education and social education can be gradually promoted. It seems that there is a need to reorganize local education funds, and the reorganization methods must be adapted to local conditions. The Anhui Department of Education's tentatively drafted reorganization measures and plans for local education funds are recorded below: (A) "Measures for Reorganizing Local Education Funds": This year's provincial supervisors in Anhui Province are inspecting local education in various counties slightly differently from previous years. In the entire province, in addition to the provincial capital's public and private primary and secondary schools and social education institutions being inspected jointly or in groups by various supervisors, four counties, Liu'an, Huoqiu, Huoshan, and Lihuang, are assigned special commissioners for reorganization. Inspection is divided into five inspection zones, with each zone inspecting for one year. The supervisors designated in each zone, in addition to inspection, pay special attention to guidance work. Regarding the reorganization of local education funds, the following items are included: (1) The allocation standards for education funds in various counties should be implemented in accordance with the orders of the Department. Temporary income can only be used for temporary expenses. If there is a percentage of income, a special report should be submitted to the Department for approval before it can be used. (2) When preparing the budget, Education Bureaus in various counties are absolutely not allowed to falsely list income or inflate expenses. At the end of each month, income and expenditure reports for the month should be prepared separately according to the nature of the funds and submitted to the Department for record. (3) County governments and financial institutions in various counties are not allowed to misappropriate or divert education surcharges collected on their behalf. They should be handed over to the Education Bureau for safekeeping as soon as they are collected, and a settlement should be made jointly at the end of each month. (4) School properties in various counties should be registered comprehensively within a limited time and reported to the Department for record. (5) Education Bureaus in various counties should allocate funds sparingly according to the budget and should not arbitrarily misuse them or delay reporting expenses. (6) School rents in various counties should be collected directly from tenants by the Education Bureau, and any dual systems should be abolished. (7) Special funds for free education in various counties should be used exclusively for compulsory education and should not be diverted to other uses. (8) After clearing the expenses for the current month, Education Bureaus in various counties should prepare cash disbursement calculations and bureau expenditure statements, etc., according to the receipt and expenditure report form and the amount disbursed, and submit them to the Department for verification. (9) After the cash disbursement calculations and bureau expenditure statements, etc., for previous months have been verified by the Department, the income and expenditure final accounts for the previous year should be prepared and submitted to the Department for review. (10) Expenses outside the budget that have not been approved by the Department should be compensated by the Bureau Chief personally. (11) Education Bureaus in various counties should recover special funds for vocational education within a limited time and deposit them in banks or reputable shops. Private storage is strictly prohibited. (B) "Plan for Reorganizing Local Education Funds": The Anhui Provincial Department of Education's plan for reorganizing local education funds is roughly divided into two parts: (1) Investigation and Clearance of School Funds: Based on the economic situation in Anhui Province in recent years, it is not reasonable or permissible to actively increase revenue and increase the burden on the people. The Provincial Department of Education now plans to thoroughly investigate the special funds that have been designated in order to clarify the actual situation. For the actual monthly income and expenditure of each county Education Bureau, a monthly income and expenditure report form should be filled out and submitted within a limited time. A detailed investigation should be made of the total amount of free and general education funds accumulated in each county, the situation of occupation or misappropriation by other agencies, and the current storage status, and each should be thoroughly reorganized and recovered separately, and properly stored by the county Education Bureaus. (2) Reorganization of School Properties: Regarding school properties in various counties, the Department plans to conduct a general registration of all school fields, houses, rents, and taxes in various counties. After the registration is completed, the Provincial Government will be requested to send personnel to various counties to conduct on-site measurement and reorganization to see if there is any encroachment or profiteering, or underreporting of income. After the special commissioners have clearly reorganized the school properties in each county, they will separately draw up diagrams and submit them to the Department for reference. The Department will then request the Provincial Government to restrict the arbitrary sale of school properties by various counties. (6) Implementation Status of the First Phase of Compulsory Education and Short-Term Vocational Education in Mass Schools: The implementation of mass schools and compulsory education has not yet achieved significant results. The biggest difficulties are approximately two: (1) It is not easy to raise funds. (2) It is difficult to recruit teachers and talent. In addition, most of the current mass education personnel are accommodating to the status quo and lack the spirit of improvement, so the results are not significant. The first phase of compulsory education, originally set from August of the 21st year to July of the 24th year, has not yet begun in Anhui Province, likely due to the two difficult problems of economy and teachers. A first-phase compulsory education implementation plan is currently being drafted, ordering all departments to follow it in preparing for the establishment of compulsory education pilot zones in urban and rural areas of each county, and setting a deadline for them to formulate plans and maps based on the conditions of each county and submit them to the Department for record.</p>
<p>Regarding short-term vocational education, the Provincial Department of Education has drafted an implementation plan, ordering various counties to organize it within a limited time. Currently, the counties that have submitted plans include Taihu, He County, Langxi, Hao County, Huaining, Nanling, Taiping, Guichi, Susong, Mengcheng, Jixi, Dingyuan, Fengyang, Zhide, and Tianchang, a total of fifteen counties. All have been reviewed by the Department and ordered to actively proceed from the second semester of this year. The remaining counties have also recently submitted plans one after another. In the future, in addition to ordering various counties to report the progress of the work to the Department for record at any time, the Department also ordered the provincial supervisors in each zone to earnestly supervise and promote the plans formulated by various counties, with the goal of ensuring that all out-of-school children of appropriate age in various places receive the minimum level of education within five years.</p>
<p>A model zone for free education is being prepared. Currently, it is planned to first establish two compulsory education and short-term compulsory education pilot zones in urban and rural areas of Huaining County, the location of the provincial capital, as models for promoting free education in various counties. In terms of funding, more than 10,000 yuan has been raised. A preparatory committee is currently being organized and plans to begin investigating schools, school-age children, out-of-school children of appropriate age, children in school, and private tutoring, temples, and ancestral halls, etc., in urban and rural areas near the provincial capital. Once the investigation is completed, the Department plans to make practical preparations based on the actual local conditions.</p>

<p>The Entire Class of General Third Grade, Group A, Ordered to Leave School</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Recently, public and private schools in Anhui, due to the impending winter vacation, have been holding semester exams one after another. At the Provincial Senior High School, the students of Group A of the third grade of the general course, on the afternoon of the 16th, during the Western History exam given by teacher Weng, were nowhere to be found in the classroom. They had also written insulting words about Weng on the blackboard in the classroom before leaving the school as a group. Principal Sun Wenyuan reported everything to the Department of Education. Zheng Hechun, the acting secretary of the Department of Education, instructed him to handle the matter carefully. Later, Governor Liu Zhenhua of the province heard about it and notified the Department of Education by phone that evening to send the semester exam schedule for all secondary schools in the provincial capital for review, and instructed them to investigate separately. The Department of Education immediately sent it to the Provincial Government overnight. Then, Mr. Sun reported to the Department of Education that the students of Group A of the third grade of the general course had boycotted the exam. After guiding them, they still showed no remorse and proposed a handling method: (1) Order them to leave school immediately; (2) Before the start of the next semester, wait for the school's screening notice to return to school and take a make-up exam. Secretary Zheng and Principal Sun went to the Provincial Government, and Mr. Liu personally approved the words "order to leave school" on the original report and instructed them to comply immediately. The Department of Education immediately transferred the order to comply. On the morning of the 17th at 7:00 a.m., Mr. Liu came to the school, and Secretary Zheng of the Department of Education also went there at 7:00 a.m. Immediately, he supervised Principal Sun and ordered the entire class of Group A of the third grade of the school to leave school and return to their hometowns at 11:00 a.m. The students of that class immediately obeyed the order and left school at 10:00 a.m. to return to their hometowns. The other classes continued to take the exam as usual. (January 19)</p>

The entire school was destroyed by enemy troops during the January 28th Incident. Although several schools have been set up in Fusheng Road, Bazilu Road, and Baek Road, the number of students has continued to increase. However, due to the unsuitability of the school building, the construction of a new school building is being planned. In addition to the original school directors Wen Qinfu, Wang Yunwu, Tang Baoshu, Wu Yaoting, and Yang Runzhi, Wu Tiecheng, Yu Hongjun, Zhang Rongpu, Guo Shuntang, and Tang Haian were also invited as new school directors. A meeting was held at the Guangzhao Guild Hall yesterday. Wu Tiecheng, Li Dachao, Wu Yaoting, Wang Yunwu, Chen Daocun, Zhuo Fengzhen, Chen Hongbi, and others attended.

However, our country has not yet made any preparations. Those who are concerned about sports privately have the will but not the power, and there is no way to start. The Northeast Sports Association believes that Northeast athlete Liu Changchun's 100-meter and 200-meter short-distance races are not only leading in the country, but also have considerable hope in the Far Eastern Games. It was decided to send him to Shanghai early to concentrate on practice in preparation for a competition to raise the eyebrows and breathe a sigh of relief for the Chinese people.</p>

<p>Starting at 7:30 PM in the West Qing Gymnasium</p>
<p>8:20 PM, Xinyang vs. Mingqiang Final</p>
<p>The West Qing Basketball Association is coming to an end. The two teams, Pirates and McLing, who are evenly matched, are scheduled to hold the final at the West Qing Basketball Hall at 7:30 PM tonight to determine who will be the champion of this year's competition. This game is truly one of the most exciting scenes of this season's basketball game. The referee has been set as Hall, and the inspector is Grisby. Tickets are divided into two types, one yuan and six corners. From 8:30 PM, the first battle of the triangular final between Xinyang of the second group and Mingqiang of the third group will be held.</p>
<p>Two games were played last night, both belonging to Group A. (1) Qingguang defeated Xiaguang, 45 to 27. The Xiaguang team's members were incomplete and the formation was disorganized. Qingguang was exceptionally experienced, so it won a great victory. (2) Youbang defeated Nanxing, 49 to 32. Youbang always took the lead. Nanxing also lost its normal performance due to homesickness during the winter vacation.</p>
<p>Qingguang Defeats Xiaguang Xiaguang's main player, Lin Qiren, returned to his home province last week to visit relatives, and his strength was greatly reduced. Guan Xun'an was also late, and the formation was inevitably disorganized. However, it was quite active at the beginning. Chen Zhaoqiu first made a free throw. Qingguang broke through, and in a moment, it exceeded 6 to 1. Huang Jianfei suddenly became brave and pursued, tying the score at 6 each. However, after this, it fell into a slump. Qingguang threw farther and farther. Lu Dazhen often made wonderful shots, and Wu Chunwu, despite his big belly, also made two shots successively. As a result, Qingguang won with 45 to 27.</p>
<p>Youbang Defeats Nanxing Youbang always occupied the leading position. Liang Guoquan opened the record. Although Nanxing's strong players were scattered, all the players were united and persisted in fighting, closely following behind. The first half ended temporarily with 18 to 13. In the second half, Youbang worked harder. The three forwards cooperated and scored a lot. Finally, Nanxing hoped to draw, but it was still defeated with 32 to 49 due to its inability to resist.</p>

<p>Defeats Min University to Win the Indoor Championship</p>
<p>Defeats US Soldiers to Win the International Championship</p>
<p>(Beiping Newsletter) The Beiping China University basketball team, which represented Beiping at the 5th National Games in Nanjing last year, has recently won two Beiping championships in two days. On the 18th, in the city's indoor basketball elimination tournament organized by the Law School, China University defeated its only strong opponent, Min University, 39 to 23. According to the two heroes, they also met in the disaster relief match a week ago, and China University also won. In the Beiping International Open Basketball Tournament, China University, the US Soldier Headquarters, and the US Soldier 62nd Company had equal scores. In the triangular final, China University first defeated the headquarters, and on the 19th, it defeated the 62nd Company again. China University won the championship again and dominated the ancient capital. It can be said that it is invincible.</p>
<h3 id="e229">China University Defeats Min University in Indoor Basketball <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>The Law School's indoor basketball tournament started on November 18th last year and ended with the final on the 18th, lasting exactly two months. A total of 29 teams participated, excluding the Liuli team, which withdrew halfway, and a total of 100 games were held. That night, China University and Min University held the final. No fewer than a thousand people came to watch the game. As a result, China University defeated Min University 39 to 23 and won this year's honor. Bai Pengfei, the Dean of the Law School, stood up and gave a speech after the two teams finished the game, saying, "The result of this competition is satisfactory. All team members were able to uphold the spirit of mutual struggle and engage in physical competition, which is admirable. However, the hope for the future is that in addition to strictly observing discipline and sportsmanship, we must also avoid being arrogant in victory and discouraged in defeat, and preserve the true nature of sports." As for the skills of the two teams, the Min University team's prestige has declined since the departure of veteran Yao Enhan and others. After the team was established this year, it worked hard to practice, and it was able to show its face in the indoor open tournament and compete with China University for the championship. The team's coordination is still satisfactory, but it is sometimes too slow. The China University team performed very well, and the passes were appropriate. However, the forwards' attack was too deep under the basket, which sometimes prevented them from taking advantage of good opportunities.</p>

<p>Our Country Opposes the Philippines' Endorsement</p>
<p>The case of the puppet state of Manchuria requesting to join the Far Eastern Games as a member has been resolutely rejected by our country's authorities. It is learned that the National Sports Association of our country received a telegram from the Philippine Sports Association yesterday (the 22nd), officially notifying that it would not accept Manchuria as a new member of the Far Eastern Games. The meaning of the telegram is as follows: "According to China's vote against, the acceptance of Manchuria as a member of the Far Eastern Games is formally rejected." According to the Far Eastern Games charter, any country's request to join as a member must be unanimously approved by all old member states before it can be accepted. Manchuria is neither a formal country nor is it possible for all member states to approve its accession. Knowing this is doing things that are troublesome.</p>

<p>The International Basketball Tournament has ended. The US Soldier Headquarters, the US Soldier 62nd Company, and China University have equal scores. It was decided to hold a final to determine who would be the champion. As a result of the draw, the 62nd Company was lucky enough to get a bye. China University and the US Headquarters then clashed the other day. China University relied on the efforts of its generals to defeat the foreign soldiers. At 6:30 PM on the 19th, it met the 62nd Company at the Military Police Camp to compete for the championship. Although the weather was cold and the north wind was howling, the audience was still very enthusiastic. As a result, China University defeated the 62nd Company again with 54 to 31 and won the championship. The performances of both teams were excellent and extremely fierce. The game was divided into four quarters. In the first quarter, 10 to 8, China University only won by two points. In the second quarter, China University won by two points again. The first half ended with 24 to 20. In the second half, China's arrogance was extraordinary, and the passes were wonderful. The enemy was frightened. The three generals Duan Zhuo, Zhao Zhenji, and Zhang Yucai were successful on both sides, and the score was accumulating. The US public's formation was chaotic and unable to cheer up. As a result, it fell sharply and was unable to do anything. As a result, China University won the championship with 54 to 31.</p>

<p>The other afternoon, the Gonghua Football Team and the Lianglu Group A Football Team played a friendly match at the McGan Road Stadium, with He Chunhui as the referee. Most of the Lianglu players came from Jiaotong University and had been fighting on the battlefield for a long time, so their strength was very strong. The Gonghua team was organized by the Chinese staff of the Public Works Bureau. They rarely practiced on weekdays due to their job responsibilities. Fortunately, goalkeeper Chen Lixiang defended well, and center back Wu Jianhe was based in the Central Plains, taking care of both offense and defense. Zhou Zhaowen and Wang Zhensheng coordinated left and right, running across the entire field. In the first half, with the help of the wind, they scored one goal. In the second half, they cleverly won one goal against the wind. As a result, Gonghua won 2-0.</p>

<h3 id="e235">Slaughterhouse <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>I heard that there is a large-scale slaughterhouse in Chicago, USA. The most shocking thing is a huge cow-killing machine, which I can't even imagine what kind of device it is. It is said that every day, groups of cows, dozens or hundreds of them, are driven into the machine alive, and when they come out from the other side, there are no more live cows. The cowhide, cow bones, and beef are separated cleanly.</p>
<p>I often imagine this magical machine, and I always feel that it is symbolic.</p>
<p>Casually flipping through the daily newspapers, we can always see that, like that machine killing cows, this modern devil-like big city has slaughtered countless human lives. Just like the cows being driven into that terrible big machine, countless hungry humans from economically bankrupt rural areas or areas that have become famine-stricken due to drought and flood disasters are driven into this murderous city.</p>
<p>But they are not like cows, who are prepared to be slaughtered, to have their lives taken away, and to have their skin, bones, flesh, and blood separated. They are asking for life, asking for a job to live! However, the only way out that this city has prepared for them is to endure hunger and cold, beg on the streets, and wait for that final death. If they are brave, after a burst of angry roar, they can take their lives as a transaction, better as petty thieves and burglars, and even more vicious as robbers and kidnappers. If they can survive for a while, they are lucky. If something happens, it is no worse than those who have already died on the road. There are also those who are weaker and do not even have access to evil. They really become cows, taking their wives and children and throwing themselves into the Huangpu River, or first killing their loved ones with their own hands, and then committing suicide.</p>
<p>We often hear and see these things, and we don't feel anything. It is less surprising than someone telling us about that huge machine in Chicago that kills cows because this city is much larger. It is not as concrete as when we imagine that machine killing cows. However, can we say that this modern city is not more terrible than that machine that kills cows every day?</p>
<h3 id="e236">A Brief Discussion on Literature and Art <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>In the past, Wang Shizhen once made nine lives for articles: First, poverty; second, suspicion and jealousy; third, blemishes and defects; fourth, frustration; fifth, exile; sixth, punishment and humiliation; seventh, premature death; eighth, incompleteness; ninth, no descendants. Later, he added malignant diseases, making a total of ten lives. Articles have ten major sins against people. People are inherently innocent, and the sin lies in the articles. Those who have a pen must be aware of this!</p>
<p>I now announce the crimes of literature and art. I will only list the major aspects. In short, there are three crimes:</p>
<p>Scholars should first have the capacity for learning and insight, and then literature and art. Once one becomes a writer, one is no longer worthy of respect. If a person is useless, literature and art are to blame. This is the first major crime of literature and art.</p>
<p>Virtue is the root, and literature and art are the branch. If one has surplus energy after practicing virtue, then one can study literature. If a person has no virtue, literature and art are to blame. This is the second major crime of literature and art.</p>
<p>Yan Zhitui said that the essence of writing is to highlight interest and express the spirit, which makes people arrogant and conceited, so they neglect self-cultivation and are eager to make progress. Today's literati are particularly troubled by this. Once they have a satisfactory matter or a clear sentence, their spirit soars to the clouds and their ambition surpasses the ages. They sing and appreciate themselves, unaware that there are others around. If a person invites disaster, literature and art are to blame. This is the third major crime of literature and art.</p>
<p>I have enumerated the crimes of literature and art, and it is complete with three. Flipping through the news, I add another crime. What is the crime? It hinders mathematics. Expanding on this, it endangers science. Classical Chinese is gone, and vernacular has taken its place. I excerpt the words of a certain gentleman as follows:</p>
<p>...Chinese people have always disliked numbers. Vague adverbs such as "probably" and "approximately" are often the buzzwords of Chinese people. Most middle school students tend to dislike mathematics because the temptation of literary books often uses "incompatibility" as a reason to erase mathematics with one stroke. This is really a dangerous thing. Today's science is built on mathematics. Academic disciplines that are entered into by mathematics can be accurately established as science. For example, when mathematics enters the realm of astronomy, astronomy becomes an accurate science. The same is true for other physics, chemistry, psychology, economics, etc. In recent years, in the entrance examinations for freshmen in various universities, out of a thousand math test papers, about 500 have received a zero score. With the level of mathematics being so low, what are we talking about scientific research?</p>
<p>The words of a certain gentleman are insightful and incisive. If it were not for the temptation of literary books, why would middle school students be unwilling to study mathematics deeply? If the level of mathematics were not so low, why would China have no scientific research to speak of? With this in mind, China's failure to progress in science, leading to cultural backwardness and national misfortune, is originally the sin of literature and art. Alas, literature and art, your sins are indeed countless!</p>
<h3 id="e237">Guest <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Dao Wu</p>
<p>A guest came this day.</p>
<p>The wife opened the door and, seeing that a guest had arrived, hurriedly called out loudly:</p>
<p>"Jianhu, Aunt and Sister-in-law are here!" It seemed as if she was warning him. This warning indeed shook him and gave him a big fright.</p>
<p>So the husband came out to greet them, and the two of them, while busying themselves to invite these two honored guests to sit down, secretly looked at each other, each understanding the other's thoughts. However, they had no choice but to ask each other tentatively: What should we do?</p>
<p>These two guests were very distinguished. One was the wife's aunt, and the other was this aunt's new daughter-in-law. The aunt didn't come often, and her new daughter-in-law was visiting for the first time. After the aunt settled down, she said, "The daughter-in-law hasn't been out much since she joined the family. I thought I'd take her around to visit some relatives while the weather is nice, so everyone can see each other more often in the future. Today, we're visiting you first. Because you are the furthest away, it's not easy to come."</p>
<p>She explained her intention, and the hosts quickly echoed, expressing their welcome. The husband called to his wife, "Quick, bring some refreshments."</p>
<p>The wife readily agreed, but her eyes were fixed on him, as if asking, "Where are the refreshments?" So she told her husband to quickly boil water. And since Aunt smokes, bring a pack of cigarettes as well.</p>
<p>The two hurried back inside. The wife complained to her husband, "What about the refreshments? There's no rice at home, what refreshments can we offer?"</p>
<p>The husband held the kettle in one hand and extended the other to her, softly saying, "The copper coins left over from last night are enough to buy water. But what about the money for cigarettes?" He seemed to be retaliating against her. But what to do? He couldn't think of a solution.</p>
<p>The wife took out two jiao (small coins) from under the pillow and handed them to him, "Quick, go buy some refreshments." He took them, put down the kettle, and ran out the back door. Soon, he returned with several paper parcels, panting. The wife was just bringing in glass cups and saucers from outside. The guest outside said loudly, "Don't bother. We'll be coming often in the future, there's no need to be so polite."</p>
<p>The wife replied while asking her husband, "What to do?" The husband frowned, shaking his head anxiously, and replied, "These are all your relatives, what can I do?"</p>
<p>The wife got angry, and the two almost started arguing. But then, they both seemed to be awakened by something. The wife went out with two plates filled with refreshments, and the husband stood there in a daze, thinking that they had passed the first hurdle. Now, how to get through the second one?</p>
<p>The wife came back with a smile, but then her face turned bitter. The husband asked, "Now, we should buy a pack of cigarettes, is there still money?"</p>
<p>The wife asked in surprise, "You haven't bought the cigarettes yet? Why didn't you buy them at the same time?"</p>
<p>He was reminded by her that he had indeed miscalculated, but replied, "Buying all the refreshments wasn't enough, how could I have money left over to buy cigarettes?"</p>
<p>She was stunned, then suddenly remembered something. She quickly opened the wardrobe, took out a newly made qipao that she hadn't worn yet, and threw it to him.</p>
<p>"Is there anything else? You haven't even worn this one yet."</p>
<p>"Hurry up, what does it matter whether it's been worn or not?" The wife almost shouted. The husband turned around, picked up the kettle, and went out. He had no time to hesitate.</p>
<p>After visiting two or three pawnshops, the pawnshop assistants seemed to be deliberately making things difficult for him. Finally, he shouted angrily, "Do whatever you want, just pawn it! This is a new qipao that hasn't been worn, you see." He painfully took it back and handed it over again…</p>
<p>He returned with a pawn ticket and two banknotes, feeling much relieved. Later, they kept the guests for a meal. Both the husband and wife treated the guests very satisfactorily, looking at each other from time to time, conveying their mutual comfort. After the meal, the wife accompanied the aunt and new sister-in-law to chat, and the husband paced back and forth in the room with peace of mind. The topic suddenly turned to playing mahjong. The aunt liked to play mahjong. She casually suggested:</p>
<p>"How about we play a few rounds today?"</p>
<p>They were almost stunned. The wife looked at her husband, silent. He pretended to be very calm, echoing repeatedly, while calculating in his heart how he only had two or three double haos left. He urged his wife to invite the landlady to join, or he could avoid getting involved by acting a role and escaping this difficult situation.</p>
<p>The wife indeed invited the landlady and brought the mahjong tiles. After the introductions, they arranged the table and chairs. The aunt and the landlady sat down first, leaving two places empty on either side. The husband knew he couldn't escape and sat down. The wife insisted on pulling the new sister-in-law to sit down, but the new sister-in-law declined modestly, saying "I don't know how," so the two started pushing back and forth, and the dispute was not easily resolved.</p>
<p>As a result of the argument, the aunt decided that the new daughter-in-law should play. She knew that her niece still had to entertain the guests and manage things, so she couldn't play. This decision was made after her careful and considerate consideration.</p>
<p>The game continued until dark. After dinner, according to the aunt's wishes, they had to continue playing, but fortunately the new sister-in-law had to leave.</p>
<p>Calculating the wins and losses, the husband lost, owing the new sister-in-law more than two yuan. What to do? He asked his wife, "Do you have any money on you? Give it to me." He knew she didn't have any, but he couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the wife took out two banknotes and gave them to him. So it ended without difficulty. The guests casually took the money, said goodbye, and they saw them to the street corner.</p>
<p>After returning, the husband breathed a long sigh of relief, then suddenly remembered something and asked with a smile, "Where did the two banknotes come from just now?" The wife smiled bitterly and pointed to the bed with her mouth. He looked and saw that a quilt was missing. He sighed, and the two could only smile bitterly at each other.</p>
<h3 id="e238">The Question of Muslims Not Eating Pork (Continued) <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Yiyuan</p>
<p>The second time was a conversation with an Egyptian student supervisor stationed in Lyon. His explanation was as follows:</p>
<p>"The Koran is for all ages, so in the days when science was not developed, Allah had forbidden us to eat pork. Now that modern science has developed, the slaughterhouses in cities like Berlin, Germany, although they do not prohibit eating pork, their inspections are particularly strict!</p>
<p>Berlin slaughters about thousands of pigs every day. The slaughterhouse has a special inspection room, divided into two parts, each with fifteen people. During slaughter, a piece is cut from the left and right kidneys of each pig, numbered, and then sent to this room for separate inspection. Only after being verified as non-toxic can it be sold. Because there is a microorganism called trichina (trichinella) parasitic in the pig's body that can make people sick. So I think that the Muslim prohibition of eating pork is entirely for hygiene reasons. As for touching it, I have not seen any explicit prohibition. But if it is filthy all over, it is not a pig, we would not want to get close to it.</p>
<p>Like raising pigs for profit, I think it is wrong, and it is considered a violation of religious tenets. But the extreme avoidance of pigs and pork by the Muslims in your country, and even the tea offered by people of other religions is not accepted, is a bit of an overcorrection."</p>
<p>The third time was a visit to three Arabs in the Qingzhen (mosque) in Paris, which was built in recent years. They are all "Ahmadi" (i.e., long education). After I raised the question, they made the following explanations:</p>
<p>"The Koran forbids us to eat pork, so we should not eat it. It is wrong to use hygiene reasons or the knowledge of science to justify it. We need to be clean. Since pigs are dirty, of course we don't need to touch them on purpose. Meat with bloodstains, not just pork, is enough to stain our clothes. It is enough to wash it clean. The classic only prohibits eating, there is no other basis." "If someone says that soap is made of lard, can Muslims not use it?" I asked again.</p>
<p>"It is not said that soap is absolutely not made of lard, even if it is made of lard, as long as you use it to remove dirt, you can use it, because we only prohibit 'eating' pork." "Can a toothbrush made of pig bristles be used by Muslims to brush their teeth in their mouths?"</p>
<p>"Yes, because you only use it to brush your teeth, and the scripture prohibits 'eating pork.' You only need to be faithful to the prohibition of the scripture." "Someone once asked a great scholar, if a calf is raised on pig milk, can this calf be eaten by Muslims? He replied that it can, because the cow is still a cow and has not become a prohibited animal, so it can be eaten. My religion is very free and very generous. Just look at this explanation to know what the spirit of my religion is like."</p>
<p>In summary, the above three conversations prove that my grandfather's claim is indeed reasonable. In addition to "not eating pork," all kinds of dietary taboos of Muslims in our country are enough to increase the estrangement with people of other religions, and restrict the development of Muslim professions, leading to an added layer of hardship in the lives of the Muslim masses. I hope that this article can help them consider, on a stand that does not violate religious teachings, to improve their habits, so that it may not be without some benefit to communicating common feelings and expanding the scope of Muslim professions. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e239">Father and Daughter (4) <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>As he spoke, he inserted his fingers into her hair and stroked it. His trembling hands made her hair hurt. But she tried to endure it and didn't dare say anything.</p>
<p>She watched her father put on his pajamas and lie down on the bed. She personally arranged the mosquito net neatly. Then, saying goodnight, she gently walked out and returned to her bedroom.</p>
<p>That night, there was good moonlight, which shone through the window screen and cast the flowers on the screen onto the floor. She lay on the bed, quietly listening to the complete silence of the entire world. She thought of the mother she had never met, sketching her in her mind, and gradually fell asleep. That night, she had dreams one after another, and in those dreams, the father's face flashed. She woke up before dawn and walked to her father's bedroom. When she pushed open the door, and opened it only enough for one person to pass through, she was blocked by something. She didn't push hard, flattened her body, and barely squeezed in. She immediately saw her father sleeping on the floor at the door, with saliva flowing from the corner of his mouth, and two empty wine bottles lying beside him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she began to cry. She felt that he was not her father, but just an evil person. The sadness accumulated in her chest poured out, and she fell on the bed and cried loudly.</p>
<p>The sound of crying woke the father who was sleeping on the ground. He woke up, raised his eyes, saw her, shook his head in shame, and struggled to support himself with his arms. He sighed a long sigh, and because he had no strength, he lay back on the ground.</p>
<p>Hearing his sigh, the daughter suppressed her grief, stopped crying, raised her face from her palms, saw his pitiful appearance, and naturally stood up, sobbing, walked to where he was lying, bent down and helped him up, and let him sit on the low chair with a back. She herself went to the bedside and sat down.</p>
<p>He sat there, silently, without a sound. Tears gradually formed in his eyes, slowly becoming bigger and bigger, and then flowed down his cheeks. His face was twisted in pain, as if he had something to say but couldn't, and his tears flowed down even more.</p>
<p>"Dad, you don't love me, you don't love me!"</p>
<p>She murmured, her face was plain, with no expression at all. It seemed that there was no need to worry too much about such a father, and there was no need to care about him.</p>

<h3 id="e240">Financial and Gold Markets Remain Stable, Hovering Around 90 Yuan <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Silver Price and Exchange Rate Continue to Fall, Resulting in a Rise of Two Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market was quite stable yesterday, hovering around 90 yuan all day. Public sentiment is still stable and the underlying momentum is also good. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and the US both fell, with forward silver prices on the Gold and Silver Exchange falling by 1.1 to 2%. Exchange rates were uniformly lower. London gold fell by 1 penny, US cotton fell by 8 points, US wheat fell by 0.75, and stock fluctuations were minimal. The wool market opened with an initial call of 87.8 yuan, public sentiment was quite good, and major players were also interested in buying, gradually rising to 93.4 yuan, and then slightly declining. The market was flat at the beginning of the opening, but the domestic market was loose and abundant, and silver companies were selling, causing the gold price to fall below 90 yuan. The determination of the industry was still firm, so there were still many rebounds, but Western merchants such as Sassoon and George &amp; Co. still had a desire to sell, and at noon it was still within 90 yuan. The afternoon market was quite calm, with supply and demand in the market balanced, forming a spiral. When Reuters reported that the US would find ways to implement its gold policy, but would prevent future silver imports, the industry initially thought it would benefit silver prices and selling increased sharply. But after the full text was typed out, after careful reading, it had no impact on silver prices. Repeated buying then returned to stability, retail shorts made up for their positions, and the market closed above 90 yuan. After the market closed, rumors spread that the US was planning to purchase silver, and finally retreated to within 90 yuan. The settlement price was 1,090 yuan. The daily market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 691 yuan 9 jiao, up 2 yuan 6 jiao from last Saturday. Goods opened at 2 yuan 2 jiao. The exchange market opened with a recent selling price of 1 shilling 4 pence 3125 for British exchange and 34 yuan for US exchange. Hengyu made progress, but because the Zhengjin Huabisai March US dollar was 25, it gradually moved downstream from 2 yuan 8 jiao. It was expected that HSBC's listing price would not move. Hengxing, Yuanmao, Yongda, Decheng and others sold together. Silver companies sold Zhengjin's January US dollar 1.875 and May 8.125, and fell to within 89 yuan. Dafa, Yongbing and Xingna made some struggles, and when Shanghai came out with May US dollar 875, Hengxing, Daxing and Yong sold again, and fell to 87 yuan 6 jiao. Shenkang took advantage of the low price to enter, and gradually rebounded. After entering, May US dollar 875 was difficult to settle. Zhifeng, Yongyi, Fengyong, Daxing, Yongzhaofeng and Changyuanmao bought together, and rose to 90 yuan 2 jiao. After entering, retail investors pressed down, but Hengyu entered, so there was still a period of hovering. When Shengda strongly sold in the market, Yuanmao, Yongda, Xingyong, Ruixing and others also sold, and Mitsui Zhengjin sold March US dollar 4.375, and fell to 87 yuan 6 jiao. Zhengjin peeled off May US dollar 875, Yuanmao Yonghengyu took advantage of the low price to buy again, and the goods also lifted, and the noon closing gradually rose to 689 yuan and a half, and the goods were photographed at the same price.</p>
<p>The after-hours market opened at 689 yuan, and the goods opened at 8 yuan 9 jiao. Ruikang, Shunli, Hengxing and others sold in the market, and Mianqian, Changxiang and Tianfeng entered, so they struggled around 9 yuan. When Reuters telegrams were reported, Hengxing, Yuanmao and Yonghengyu all sold, and Shanghai and others sold March US dollar 4.375, and retreated from 9 yuan 7 jiao to 7 yuan 3 jiao. There was nothing that this electricity was of little benefit to silver prices. Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yongdaxingyong and others urgently bought in, and the situation was flat again, and public sentiment was also good. Dadecheng, Hengyu Yuanda, Yong and others continued to buy, and although Hengxing and Ruixing sold, the situation was quite good, and gradually rose to 91 yuan 4 jiao. The closing price was 691 yuan 3 jiao. The market was flat and then tired after closing. Ruixing, Hengxing, Yidayong and Yisheng sold, and foreign electricity had news of US buying silver, and finally fell to within 90 yuan. Goods were photographed at 90 yuan. The highest price in one day was 692 yuan 8 jiao, the lowest price was 687 yuan 3 jiao, and there was an up and down of 5 yuan and a half. As a result, it rose 2 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The listed price was 33 yuan 75 because HSBC's US exchange listing price did not move, which is equivalent to a biao jin price of 711 yuan. According to the closing price, the push was about less than 10 yuan, 1 yuan less than last Saturday. The registered price for this month is 713 yuan, February is 704 yuan, and March is 690 yuan. The replenishment water in the morning is 713 yuan, the replenishment water in the afternoon is 714 yuan, and the settlement price is 1,090 yuan. The trading in the market was flat and tired. The Hakka helped to enter the replenishment, and sold to the Tianjin help by Yingfeng Hengda Decheng Dafeng Heng and others for a total of about 1,000 taels, and the transaction price ranged from 1,090 yuan 5 jiao to 90 yuan. Swaps seem to lack formal transactions, but February has slightly changed. There are now 1561 January notes remaining.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was mediocre. Hengxing Shengda Dachangxiang Bingxing Ruikang Ruixing Yuanmao Shuifu Taiheng Tongtai Changchangsheng Yongdaxingyong and others were mainly sellers. Shunli Wanxing Sida Huixiang Yifeng Yongzhifeng Yongtianfeng Dafa Yongyongde Shenkang Xianghe Yuanheng Hengchangyong and others were mainly buyers. Hengtai Yuanchun Fuyu went in first and then went out. Hengyu Yuanmao Yong went out first and then went in. The Dalian gang Shunli co-produced more than 2,000, squeezing in more than 500. Wanxing co-produced more than 1,500, squeezing in more than 100. Guangbang Shengda sold more than 400. Hengxing entered a small number and exited 600. There are 6489 February notes remaining. Up to today, a total of 37744 March chips have been raised.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was still the same as last weekend, calculated as 5 points. Although it fell by 3 points on the previous day (Sunday), there were only 2 points. However, due to the supply and demand of various aspects, it finally stabilized at 5 points, and it was not allowed to have any fluctuations.

<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small foreign currency was the same as the previous day in the morning and afternoon markets, calculated as 845 yuan, and the transaction was sparse, calculated as 6,000 jiao in the early market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small foreign currency generally increased slightly. The early market was 792 yuan 2 jiao, which was 6 jiao better than the previous day, and the afternoon market was 5 jiao better, which was 792 yuan 7 jiao. As a result, both markets rose by 1 yuan 1 jiao, and the transaction was 75,000 jiao in the early market and 70,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper yuan did not move, still at 294,000 wen. The transaction consideration was 12,300 yuan in foreign currency, and the amount of copper yuan was more than 36,100 strings.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Stock and Bond Market Slight Fluctuations <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, as the settlement date gradually approached, the market still saw mutual buying and selling based on the relationship between long and short positions. Market prices also fluctuated slightly. Although there was good news such as the recapture of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, and the Nineteenth Route Army obeying the central government, it seemed to have no temporary impact on market prices. At the opening in the morning, retail investors slightly bought in, while major bullish players took the opportunity to reduce their positions, and market prices slightly increased by three or four cents, causing market sentiment to decline. In the second session, even more bullish players emerged. Although No. 46 did not see large sell-offs, No. 4 and No. 48, etc., saw considerable selling, and market prices uniformly fell by three or four cents, showing a rather weak trend. At the opening in the afternoon, retail investors' sell-offs also surged. Various groups also bought less and sold more, and prices remained weak and listless, falling again by two, three, or five cents. After the close, major sell-offs stopped, but No. 26 sold off hundreds of thousands of demobilization bonds, suppressing the market price by half a yuan. Afterwards, short positions gradually reduced, gradually stabilizing and trending higher. Twenty-year bonds uniformly rose by one, two, or even four cents. On the surface, it seemed to be still consolidating, but in reality, both the long and short camps began to waver. With three days remaining in the current month, fluctuations should still be considerable. If the salt tax breaks through 50 yuan again, there may still be a good upward potential of one or two yuan, because the salt tax has been consolidating around the 50 yuan mark three times. Habit is the mind, and cannot be explained by conventional theory. Yesterday's market prices mostly fell by one or two cents to six cents. The 1896 salt tax gold short and the regular six both rose by one cent to three and a half cents. The closing situation was quite strong. The total transaction volume was 18.19 million yuan for spot goods, with no opening for trading. Futures trading totaled 7 million yuan for salt tax, 2.75 million yuan for demobilization bonds, 1.535 million yuan for the 1919 reconstruction bonds, 2.57 million yuan for the 20-year reconstruction bonds, 3 million yuan for the full short regular six, and the remainder ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>

<p>The New Feng Trading Company reported from New York on the 20th, stating that stock prices were mixed and slightly higher. The volume of trading was unprecedented since last summer. Although buying was widespread across the country, market conditions did not fluctuate much because bullish players actively took profits before the weekend. However, auto stocks showed slight weakness. Commercial news favored the bulls, such as the signing of oil sales contracts, the excellent report on steel production in Yangshou, the progress of the copper mining industry, and the trend of the public continuing to purchase securities. The total turnover for half a day was 1.95 million shares. (Wheat) External buying was lacking, and there was no change in news. It is advisable to buy during sharp declines. (Cotton) According to news from Washington, the Secretary of Agriculture must have the support of a majority of farmers before allowing forced acreage reduction, because he also acknowledged the difficulty of reducing cotton fields due to new planting. Traders should still be cautious. The silver situation is chaotic, and according to reliable but unconfirmed news, the reason for the delay in the gold case is that the silver faction is striving to include silver. The Financial Rehabilitation Agency purchased gold at a price of $34.45 per ounce, unchanged. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>

<p>| Label Yarn Falls Three or Four Cents |</p>
<p>The yarn market is flat and sluggish, but actual demand is slightly active. The mainland groups bought the most, with some sporadic transactions in the southern ports. Other groups remained inactive. The exchange's standard yarn price is higher than the Caifang Longchuan yarn, and Tianjin fine yarn is also coming to Shanghai for sale, indicating that the sales of northern Chinese yarn are becoming increasingly sluggish.</p>
<p>People's Label Falls Three or Four Cents The People's Label market opened in the morning, with external cotton being flat, but there were still sufficient chips in the exchange, so market sentiment weakened again, falling by two or three cents. The market situation remained bleak in the afternoon, and each month fell another cent. The total transaction volume for the day was 10,500 bales. The sell orders came from Yuanda (550 bales), Xiesheng (450 bales), Shenchang (400 bales), Mingde (400 bales), Dafeng (300 bales), Senkang (400 bales), and Chunji (750 bales).

<p>The cotton market is showing signs of softening slightly, but buyers for the current month remain firm and unwilling to relax, so market sentiment remains high. However, there are more sellers for forward months, and most people believe that the cold weather and frozen rivers and roads make transportation difficult, leading to a lack of supply, which has caused warehouse stocks to shrink compared to before. However, the yarn market is depressed.</p>
<p>Zheng Label Falls The Zheng Label market opened in the morning, with American cotton trending lower and few buyers in the market. Each month fell by 5 to 15 points. In the afternoon, the current month rose by 5 points, while the forward months fell by 5 points. The total transaction volume for the day was 46,400 dan. The sell orders came from Chunji (3,900 dan), Dafeng (3,000 dan), Yuanda (2,000 dan), Jifeng (1,900 dan), Hengyi (1,300 dan), Yida (1,800 dan), Xinheng (1,000 dan), and Yuanxingchang (1,100 dan).

<p>Last week, due to profit-taking, reduced purchases by Japanese cotton textile merchants, and considerable arrivals from the mainland, market prices weakened. In the spot market, Chinese purchases remain smooth, while European activity is quite low. Local factories are only purchasing for immediate needs. Cotton production reports indicate damage from the recent cold wave, but the extent of the damage is not yet known.

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, the market situation for each month showed a pattern of first stabilizing and then flattening. Although the quoted prices for foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada both declined slightly by 1 cent, the market was slightly better by about half a point compared to the previous week due to some recent transactions by guest groups. However, bullish players sold off, and factories also slightly reduced their offers for forward months, causing market sentiment to weaken again. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading in each month was slightly more frequent, but because external purchases were truly scarce, both long and short positions in each session were mostly closing transactions, with little competition, and market sentiment became weak again. As a result, the current month was down 2.5%, February and March were down 5%, April was down 1.5%, May was down 7.5%, and June had no transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Wheat Futures Market Chip Supply Tightens <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, the market situation for each month generally showed a slightly positive trend. Although the quoted price for foreign wheat declined slightly by 1 cent, the supply of sell orders in the market gradually tightened. Because most of the foreign wheat that arrived belonged to factories, the exchange's hedging orders could not surge, and market demand increased slightly, making people's sentiment easier to lift. As a result, the current month was up 2 points compared to the previous week, April was up 1 point, and the rest had no comparison. Spot wheat remained inactive due to lack of interest from the factories.</p>
<h3 id="e253">He Xia Rice Market No Longer as Tight as Before <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) The supply from various groups has turned abundant again, with more than 50 ships arriving in succession. Late rice accounts for about 20 of them. Although guest group purchases continue from both the Northern and Southern Ocean groups, the situation is not as tight as before, so the late rice market shows a stable situation. Moreover, the guest merchants are taking a wait-and-see approach, indicating that they are very serious about their purchases, selecting only high-quality goods, and leaving medium-quality goods untouched. Today, the Dalian group and Xiamen group imported more than 1,000 packages, all of which are high-quality Qingjiao, Songsi Zhente Chongte goods, and the market price is stable. Those medium-quality goods such as Xilian and Fengjing are only accepted by other merchants, resulting in a slight price decrease of a few points. Various groups' thick japonica and Doyangjiandian rice still see some activity, and prices are stable. Yin Yuan arrivals have increased, and wine merchants have completely stopped, so the market situation has softened by nearly a foot. The path for Bian Yuan has widened, and the market color is outstanding.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, 56 or 57 ships arrived from various routes. Sales of various goods in the market are still active. Purchases by merchants on board have slightly moved. The market price for white japonica, Yangdu, port guest, pointed early thin rice is stable. The separate dismantling of Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan is quite brisk, and the price is tight by a few points.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Guest Xian Rice Continues to Rise by One Cent <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>| Fuzhou Purchases Are Very Strong |</p>
<p>Yesterday's market situation for guest xian rice was that, due to the peaceful situation in Fujian Province, purchases were very strong, and provincial merchants' interest was even greater. They were inquiring about machine-milled xian rice, rough xian rice, and machine-milled yuan rice. Even the Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Xinghua groups, although not yet started, often inquire in the market these days, and it is likely that they will need to purchase within the next few days. The Fuzhou group is deeply concerned that prices will be high and they will not be able to select good goods after other regions purchase, so they are becoming more active. This street also has purchases with Zhejiang Province, but they have retreated due to competition from the Fujian group. Therefore, the whole city, this street, and the Yongbo group only purchased more than 300 packages of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice. This street also purchased 200 packages of Hunan machine-milled oil rice, priced at 6 yuan 9 and a half cents, in addition to the rest purchased by the Fuzhou group. The entire market opened with 700 packages of Hunan red rough rice, priced at 5 yuan 7 and a half cents, and another 213 packages of rough oil rice, priced at 5 yuan 9 and a half cents. 586 packages of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice, priced at 7 yuan 4 cents. 500 packages of Wuxi Port Point, priced at 6 yuan 4 and a half cents, and another 200 packages of machine-milled yuan rice, priced at 8 yuan 2 and a half cents. 370 packages of Nanjing xian rice, priced at 6 yuan 3 cents. 200 packages of Mingguang xian rice, priced at 6 yuan 6 cents. Jiangxi machine-milled late rice was sought after by three groups, and the price rose by one cent. Rough red rice rose by 6 or 7 points, and the rest rose by 3 or 5 points.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Soybean Market Situation Unchanged <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market situation had no major changes. Transactions in the entire market included various beans in wagons, including one wagon of Zhengyangguan beans, three wagons of Yingzhou beans, 700 packages of Feihe beans, 400 packages of Xuzhou beans, three wagons of Bengbu beans, and more than 400 packages of Guide beans. The selling price was slightly reduced by one or two points. Factories, local merchants, mainland merchants, and Fuzhou merchants all inquired. The supply is also not much. Wagon transportation is about 6,000 to 7,000 packages per day. In addition to factories transporting their own, about 3,000 to 4,000 packages are shipped out every day, so the total inventory is about 70 or 80 wagons, so the market sentiment is not depressed.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Oil Market: White Tung Oil Prices Rise in Hankou <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Previously, white tung oil prices had fallen due to the relaxed sales in foreign firms in Hankou. In the past three or four days, foreign sales have been strong again, and the price has increased from 22.7 yuan to 23 yuan. Yesterday, according to Hankou reports, it has been sold to 23.7 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan, and the market situation still has an upward trend. However, Hankou foreign firms always agree to suspend operations when the market rises. The rise and fall of the Hankou market depends entirely on foreign sales, so the market will be sluggish if foreign sales are slightly relaxed. Many previous price increases were suppressed by foreign firms suspending operations. The previous decline was also the same reason. However, it is heard that the 200 to 300 tons purchased by each foreign firm this time seems to have the possibility of continuing to purchase based on surface observations, so the bullish sentiment in the Hankou market is very strong. Hankou firms have also slightly increased their imports of guest goods, with Xiang Tung opening at 19.12 yuan and Zhi Tung opening at 19 yuan, totaling about 2,000 to 3,000 dan, all according to guest rules. After the decline in Zhejiang Tung due to the Hankou market, the selling price of guest merchants in Hangzhou has also gradually decreased to 19.23 yuan, almost returning to the original state. However, when the news came from Hankou that the price was rising again, Hangzhou also raised its price accordingly. The opening price for the past two days has been 19.78 yuan for river delivery and 20.034 yuan for Shanghai delivery. Some local firms had already purchased a batch last week, and the base inventory was already in place, so they did not purchase more this time. If they encounter transactions, they will probably choose the cheaper ones. Moreover, the settlement period has arrived, and sales have been sporadic. The purchases are all prepared for spring sales, so they must allocate funds accordingly.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market was stable due to the slight contraction of the Dutch exchange rate and the stable tariff gold rate. The public association's offer for the front day's 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods was 19.3 yuan, and those that were not completed were already offered yesterday. Transit goods remained at 6.45 yuan. Dutch red sugar remained firm, with high-quality goods at 15.8 yuan and ordinary goods at 15.5 yuan, up 5 to 10 points from last Saturday. Taikoo Sugar B Mark was 19.75 yuan, CW Mark was 19.6 yuan, and the local factory's Mian Bai Zhenji No. 1 was pre-opened at 18.5 yuan, stating that delivery would be delayed, up 3 cents from before. Numbers 2, 3, and 4 were returned as is. Sliced green sugar continued to open with several hundred boxes, with high-quality goods at 9.4 yuan and ordinary goods at 9 to 9.1 yuan. Chaoqing only opened with more than a hundred lower-grade pieces at 11.7 yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, due to the shallow water in the Yangtze River, sources have been flooding in, and the inventory has suddenly become scarce, causing market prices to tighten. For example, guest goods have opened up to 77 yuan, and Hankou land prices have also been rising frequently. Currently, sales to Shantou are more active, and other places such as Xiamen and Wenzhou also have purchases. Yesterday, the market sold high-quality brand fungus at 82-83 yuan, miscellaneous brands at 76 yuan to 73-74 yuan, and large ear fungus at 132 yuan, up more than 10 yuan from around the beginning of the month.</p>

<p>(US Raw Silk Imports Decrease) The United States does not produce silk, but its consumption of raw silk is greater than that of any other country in the world. It relies entirely on silk-producing countries such as China, Japan, Italy, and France to supply it. Its raw silk imports amount to about 600,000 bales per year. In recent years, due to the impact of artificial silk dumping, raw silk imports have gradually decreased. In the past year, total raw silk imports from various countries were only 503,376 bales, a decrease of 84,537 bales compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>(Wuxi Factory Shipments to Shanghai Are Scarce) Since the beginning of the year, few silk factories in Wuxi have started work, and silk production has decreased daily. The number of January futures silk sold by various manufacturers in Shanghai is limited. In the blink of an eye, the end-of-month silk delivery period is approaching, but shipments to Shanghai are scarce. In the past few days, a total of only 54 bales of white factory warp such as Moon Rabbit and Double Eagle brands have been shipped.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Sales Are Still Active) Mainland silk thread merchants' imports of artificial silk are still active.

<p>(Chinese and Foreign Silk Merchants Take Advantage of Cheap Prices to Replenish Stocks) European and American silk thread merchants still have thick stocks of silk in hand, but consumption is still decreasing. Chinese silk prices are high, and no one asks about them. Silk reports are still rarely transferred to Shanghai. Various European firms and mainland silk merchants in this port, in view of the fact that silk prices have fallen to the lowest limit, are taking advantage of cheap prices to replenish their shortages. A total of 15 bales of yellow and white factory warp, 30 bales of gray warp, and 5 bales of yellow silk were traded, and prices remained firm.</p>

<p>Supplement of Shanghai News</p>
<p>Talk</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the funeral of Admiral Du Xigui took place. On the routes it passed, there were many roadside memorials. The viewers were as numerous as mountains and seas, all craning their necks and standing on tiptoe, wanting to feast their eyes.</p>
<p>By the time the funeral procession passed, the ceremony was very simple, with only a few military bands. It was not as extravagant as Sheng Xingsheng's funeral, and the viewers were greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>I wonder why Du Xigui didn't earn a few more dollars during his lifetime, so that he could display more "Huarong Road" during his funeral, allowing passersby to watch to their hearts' content.</p>
<p>Nowadays, people from all walks of life, especially traitors and treacherous merchants, are desperately making money, regardless of everything. Could it be for such a reason? However, the government has already issued a strict ban on the ceremonies of the former Qing Dynasty.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Watching a Play <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Mei</p>
<p>"Let's not talk about national affairs, let's just talk about romance." Writers in 1934 seemed to have this trend. In fact, what is there to talk about in national affairs in this year? So, leaving aside national affairs, let's talk about plays!</p>
<p>It is said that the most popular actors now, who can easily make money, are female roles specializing in playing virtuous and refined women and lively, flirtatious women – what we usually call huadan. Generally, the huadan appears in the last act, which is colloquially called the "closing play." Anyone who performs the "closing play" must have both beauty and talent, as well as great skills and magic, to be qualified. Otherwise, before the end of the show, the audience in the audience will all leave, which would be a great disappointment. Therefore, although there are distinctions among stage actors now, such as dignified male roles, painted-face roles, martial male roles, and clowns, the headliners who earn the big money are mostly huadan.</p>
<p>Although the number of unemployed people in the city is increasing in batches, entertainment venues are also increasing day by day. If you ask why, only the Great Stage across the street knows; but on the other hand, it can truly reflect the national character of the Great Republic of China – one can skip eating, but one cannot skip watching plays. Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the city's economy has been deteriorating, plummeting sharply. Although the old shops have been using the gimmick of "big discounts" to attract ordinary citizens with weak purchasing power, the year-end accounts always show debts exceeding assets. As a result, some are laying off employees and cutting salaries, while others have to close down. Logically, with such a depressed economy, people should have long disappeared from entertainment venues! But now, it's the exact opposite!</p>
<p>But then again! The people of Shanghai are indeed blessed. As long as my father has money, I can watch my play, so why should I care what you say!</p>
<p>As 1934 draws to a close, the social stage has announced two good plays: one is "Children's Year," starring the exceptionally talented child prodigy, Six-Year</p>
<h3 id="e271">Three Big Plates of "Spare Ribs" <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>I heard that this year is the "Women's National Products Year" and also the "Children's Year." This seems to be a side job for the adults and gentlemen, so it's not surprising. But, can national products really be saved by women? Can the status of tens of millions of poor children who lack clothing and food truly be elevated because of this? This is "just starting with the Three Character Classic." It will be another three hundred and thirty-odd days before we can quietly listen for good calculations. At this moment, it's still a Question</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Mark. If you're an impatient child and must predict what kind of truly genuine year this will be, though I am not talented, I dare answer: "The Year of Bad Luck for Students!" There is "evidence" as proof: First, they were kidnapped, then torn apart, and their corpses thrown into wells; houses suddenly collapsed, causing injuries and deaths; even because of "improper movement," they were given foreign "soup rice" instead of salary. These are all recent bad luck events for students, but because they happened before the new year, I'll put them aside.</p>
<p>Events that occurred at the beginning of the New Year include:</p>
<p>"Some students study purely for diplomas; and sometimes they get diplomas without having studied. Their contribution to the country is nothing more than waving flags and shouting slogans... leading to political corruption, economic bankruptcy, and social unrest..." This is the first.</p>
<p>"... We can't help but sigh deeply: knowing that the fall of Rehe was not just due to Tang Yulin; if university graduates don't even know that Chifeng is Chinese territory, shouldn't China fall?" This is the second.</p>
<p>"Many Hunan students do not accept military training, saying that they do not want to be warlords, so there is no need for military training. The ninth class of the provincial No. 1 Normal School refused military training and graduation exams, angering the authorities, who ordered the entire class to be expelled. The students immediately wrote letters of repentance, and the principal and the head of the education department tried hard to mediate, but to no avail!" This is the third.</p>
<p>The hosts inviting guests to partake in the above three big plates of "spare ribs" are naturally not the same person, and the invited guests are naturally all students. I wonder if they can handle these delicacies?</p>
<p>Although I left the academic world early and am not fortunate enough to join the feast, I haven't tasted meat for three years since September 18th. I can't help but crave the delicacies, shamelessly becoming an uninvited guest, like the Monkey King stealing peaches, taking a taste. I feel that although the　品　　名 (product names) of these three big plates are the same, the flavors are all unique:</p>
<p>The first plate seems to be too acidic, especially the last three in a row. I guess because the container is a copper plate, it caused a chemical reaction with the acid over time, and emitted an "X" taste, which is really not something that young students can swallow; it's a pity that the most delicious and worthy guest was not invited, and if they can't finish it, maybe they'll leave it for the host.</p>
<p>The second plate seems like the host mistakenly added ginger, so even he has to sigh; but it doesn't feel too strange. It's just a pity that the host of the first dish was not invited to sit in the place of honor, which greatly reduces the appeal, maybe the first host was not attentive in inviting guests earlier, so the second host doesn't need to reciprocate.</p>
<p>The third plate doesn't skimp on using chili peppers. The students have tender mouths and soft tongues after all, so it's no wonder they hurriedly decline politely, right?</p>

<p>— Mai Fu</p>
<p>| Love and Marriage |</p>
<p>It's been a while since I last saw you. I hope you're living well. As for me, thank goodness, my life is still the same as before, except that I have a few more cigarette tins and a big pile of worries.</p>
<p>Originally, my life was quite leisurely; it's just that the devil disturbed people and insisted on giving me a share of peace and happiness, sending me a little bit of trouble, which made me, who is lazy to speak, pick up a Western pen and spill words to you.</p>
<p>Alas, my friend, how could you not know about my love story? Li loves me. This comes so frankly and naturally, but there are detours, and I am forced to take them.</p>
<p>You know, I've always been very strange. I believe that as long as the other person truly loves me, there's no need for a third party to ask about it. I treat her as a friend, as a mistress, as long as she's willing. Haven't those who have children already gone through this before? Just because they have children, can they put on a stinking act?</p>
<p>The matter is like this, telling it will also make you angry! A few days ago, I wanted Li to come out and chat with me, and I missed the appointment. Then, I telegraphed her again, but she surprisingly didn't come, making chatting impossible and leading to叹天 (嘆天, sighing to the heavens). The day after the telegram, she came slowly. As soon as she met me, she burst into tears in my arms. Crying and telling me, she said that her father knew she loved me, and knew that I loved her, and also knew that we loved each other very deeply. So he insisted on interrupting us, and wouldn't allow Li to see me unless we got engaged.</p>
<p>Friend, look at how ridiculous this guy is!</p>
<p>You know, I never accept that kind of restraint, saying that I love her and am willing to sacrifice anything for her is okay, even if she lives with me, and then we separate after living together, and after separating you want me to sacrifice, I nearly have nothing to say. But forcing me to put on shackles is something I wouldn't do even if I were beheaded. Her father wants an engagement, wants marriage, just wanting to use a fake ceremony to bind me. He wants to keep me alive as a prisoner, guarding her to the death. Don't you think this is so ridiculous, underestimating me like this.</p>
<p>Think about it: engagement and marriage are such ridiculous games, how could someone's love, or lack thereof, be arranged so simply by you? If I didn't love her anymore, would the marriage ceremony stop me from avoiding divorce? Just because a ring isn't exchanged, you think we won't stay together for a thousand years? Really ridiculous, ridiculous! Nonsense, nonsense!</p>
<p>Friend, I am completely against marriage. I think coming up with this kind of thing is simply a conspiracy of love! Since it is a union of love, it must be maintained by love. If you want to maintain this union of love with ugly clauses, then come, but煩惱 (troubles) are煩惱 (troubles), and after all, the idea is the idea! You must know that I will not submit!</p>
<p>Li may disregard her father. She said she would come to live with me in three days. Whether she comes or not is still unknown, but I'll use this to test her, to see if she is easy to get but not easy to let go.</p>
<p>If writing so seriously only makes you laugh, then I really have to curse you as a bastard.</p>
<p>Whether you reply or not, it's up to you! Because I don't care whether you come or not. Goodbye.</p>
<h3 id="e273">Family Letter <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Mu</p>
<p>Today I received a letter from my father. Regarding what I said in my previous letter about making a living by writing in Shanghai and only being able to support myself, and not relying on the family too much, my father said in his letter, "What you said about not relying on the family too much makes me want to cry! Although I have many children, they are all selfish and I can't help it. None of them have your talent and qualifications. What they earn is not enough, so it's difficult to take care of the family; and I regret that your father has no talent or virtue to move my children. The old father, young brothers, and sisters at home can hardly survive even on thin porridge. You, as the eldest brother, should be a role model for your brothers; that is the only reasonable thing to do." I also received a letter from my fourth brother saying, "My illness is getting worse and worse. My blood vessels are getting more and more blocked. I can't walk more than a few steps. The other person can't hear clearly when I speak. In the classroom, the elementary school students sitting in the back row often say they can't hear me. What should I do? There is less than a month left before the holidays. Now I can only try my best to persevere. I will try to recuperate next year. But with such financial difficulties, even if I want to recuperate, I won't be able to. I'll just have to listen and let it go. It would be better to finish my debts!"</p>
<p>In ancient times, because of inconvenient transportation, distant mountains, and the chaos of war, there was a saying that "a family letter is worth ten thousand gold." Now that I have received this "ten thousand gold" family letter, although I also feel that it is enough to comfort my feelings, how can I not be worried and sad when the family letter is so full of tears!</p>
<p>After reading the family letter, I was stunned for a long time. I was already saddened by my aging father's plight in his later years, let alone the fact that he still has to maintain a family of more than a dozen people in a declining urban household to feed. He has never enjoyed life. When he was doing business, he was racking his brains to maintain a situation that was about to go bankrupt. He doesn't understand what entertainment is, and he doesn't understand what leisure is. He only knows how to find ways to maintain his business. After the family went bankrupt, he only knew how to save money and maintain the family's life, and how to find ways to get his younger siblings into school to seek knowledge... He is now with white hair and white beard, still trying to find money to feed a family of more than a dozen people and buy supplies for his younger siblings to go to school. What he hopes for is that his grown-up sons will send money home to take care of the family, but other than the fourth and seventh brothers, the sixth and eighth brothers are unemployed, and I, in this big city with more people than jobs, make a living by selling articles and can only support myself! Father, there are many declining urban families who cannot maintain their lives! Since the collapse of the rural economy, haven't the peasant families living in the countryside also been equally poor? We are a part of the poor people in China. We are neither workers nor peasants. Our declining urban family is the petty bourgeoisie. The times and classes have no way to reverse our tragic fate!…</p>
<p>What the family relies on is our grown-up sons. The fourth brother is teaching while ill. The seventh brother wrote from Nanyang saying that he was spitting blood due to overwork in stone printing and painting and may have to be laid off. Why do these two brothers have to get sick? The fourth brother said in his letter, "It would be better to finish my debts." I thought of the third, fifth, and second younger siblings who died young. They once made me cry at that time. Now that I think about it, they died early and are not responsible for the family or society. They are happier! We cannot seek death now. We must continue to fight for life and fulfill our obligations as human beings. We dare not hope for happiness. We have to grit our teeth and face suffering. That is life!</p>
<p>Mr. Miao Chongqun said at the end of "The Barefoot Person" published in "Free Talk," "Death is quite solemn in itself, right? But I think it's okay to shout like that: (the coffin carriers shout in mourning, congratulations,) they shout 'mourning,' and then 'congratulations.' It seems that a person's two-sided meanings are all there. When life walks the road to death, although in one sense it is mournful, in another sense it is also congratulatory! However, we - father, oh brothers - with the obligations of this family of more than a dozen people waiting to be fed on our shoulders, what is there to congratulate about death for us except for mournfulness? There is also the obligation that the social class gives us - we also need to fulfill our responsibilities. If we die, it is selfish, and congratulations are selfish!</p>
<p>If life is only for oneself, it is like the hedonist's drunken dream of life and death, which is inevitably boring. A life without ideals - the ideal of creating happiness for society and humanity, not simply the ideal of enjoying oneself - is difficult for anyone to endure, right? However, the blessed mediocre people live day after day without ideals, which causes those with brains, knowledge, and thoughts to have difficult questions to answer. To have an ideal life means that you have already ridden on the back of a tiger and have to whip the tiger forward! Since you are unwilling to live a mediocre life without ideals, then you have no choice but to grit your teeth, face the pain, and fight on. Life is like this, and this is life.</p>
<p>Reading family letters and rambling thoughts gave me the above life philosophy.</p>

<h3 id="e275">Profession and Career <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Mai Fu</p>
<p>People generally think that profession is the same as career, and career is the same as profession. There is no difference between them, at most they are just two names for the same thing. If our ancestors had said these words and left them behind, it would not be inaccurate; but if we talk about those surviving in today's society, there can't be no flaws.</p>
<p>We know that a profession is a job for a person to make a living. This business does not arise from one's own feelings, but is determined by an unknowable social force. A career, on the other hand, is a person's ambition, a person's desire, a person's attempt to express his strong life consciousness and launch a　人生(life)　　大(great)　企图(attempt).</p>
<p>If we carefully observe the current society, we will at least feel that it is not the society we need. Because it is full of contradictions, full</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>of mistakes, full of unspeakable chaos and inversion. Everywhere there are contradictions and the opposition of contradictions. Looking from our own standpoint, everything is pitch black.</p>
<p>Naturally, in such a society, we are not allowed to do what we want to do. We have to suffer social obstacles everywhere. Life dictates that we spend most of our time engaged in the war for bread. No matter how enthusiastic you are about dedicating yourself to literature or art, in order to hunt for daily bread, you have to restrain your enthusiasm and find a job that you don't want but can provide bread to feed your life. The current society does not allow career and profession to be combined into one. It does not allow you to want to be an artist, and only give you a share of bread based on your identity as an artist. Therefore, in this defective society, we must separate career and profession - career is one thing, and profession is another.</p>
<p>Because a profession is not the work we want, in order to satisfy a desire in our hearts - the desire to express our will to human society through our life activities, we must act according to our personality. For example, I want to become an inventor, or an artist, or a pivotal figure in politics in an era. These scientific and artistic researches, and political activities, are my heart's desires, and are the expression of my will. When these desires are not completely satisfied, it means that my career has not succeeded. We have to rely on something that is completely against our will to sustain our research.</p>
<p>This arduous struggle is the great spirit of mankind, and it is also the place of greatness in our humanity. In us, we should stimulate the development of this spirit. The stimulation of this spirit is a kind of promotion of human society, and it is also an expectation of the arrival of the society we hope for.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter what, we must separate career and profession. Because if we treat career as a profession and confuse them, we will make the mistake of not fully understanding the current society. As a result, because a profession cannot meet the desires of a career, we will inevitably develop life's suffering. If we treat a profession as a career and confuse them, the result will be that because a profession is a completely meaningless job, we will end up just "living in vain." It will completely engulf our hearts, engulf our wills, and the activity of our life consciousness will only be an unconscious mass. If we can distinguish clearly that a career is a career and a profession is a profession, then we should have an assessment of the career, a resolve to prepare and engage in the struggle. And for the profession, we will neither feel that it is empty, nor will we feel that it is boring and meaningless.</p>
<h3 id="e276">The Seven Dollars and Thirty Cents Problem <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Brother Wenbing is really a lovely person. He talked about women for half a day, claiming to be an amateur. Look at the way he described women so naturally. I don't believe that an amateur man knows so much about women. I recently learned that there are positive and negative sides to how you look at articles. Generally speaking, "the ideal woman" is a negative article. If you write a few more "love stories," you will be sent a magnificent high crown. Brother Wenbing, pay attention to the "big gifts" during the big sale era. But all of this is nonsense and has nothing to do with this article. I want to say that "writing articles is nothing more than for the sake of seven dollars and thirty cents" is not a witty remark.</p>
<p>I love literature and art. I have a tree of broken books left to me by my late father. When I have the opportunity to return to my hometown, I will definitely check them in my busy schedule to see if they have been damaged by bookworms, or move them to the yard to sunbathe them. As for the books that I have bought myself, except for those that have disappeared after being borrowed, there are more than enough to set up a used bookstore like a real bookstore: even in this difficult time to live, in the five years I have been in Shanghai, I have a bookshelf full of achievements. However, in the past, as long as there was money in my pocket, I would bring them home regardless of whether they were good or bad; now, the threshold for looking at advertisements is also more refined, and money is naturally less willing to be friends with me than in the past, so most of the works in my small building are above the horizontal line. Wei said that I buy books like "birds bringing food," because I drag them back one by one.</p>
<p>Naturally, at a certain point, I tried to learn to write articles. I believed that everything I wrote was top-notch, so the wastepaper baskets of various newspapers and supplements often had my masterpieces visiting; but I never gave up. I could write today, write tomorrow, write in the morning, write at night. Perhaps the editors of various supplements also forgot to wear their glasses, and they actually passed the dragon gate, and my value increased tenfold, and I arrogantly regarded myself as a writer.</p>
<p>But after all, he is a writer who "regards himself" as such. His works are still produced in large quantities. School publications and school wall newspapers cannot do without his works.</p>
<p>Now I am no longer a financially well-off student, nor am I a writer who "regards himself" as such. Stepping out of the school gate has transformed me, especially the five years of hard life. I don't know anything. When I wake up every day, I remember that I have to eat, my wife has to eat, and my children will also have to beg for food.</p>
<p>In this noodle shop, I think there are enough "writers" in Shanghai to make up the numbers for an aviation 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　文炳(Wenbing) are you able to admit that the phrase "writing articles is only for seven dollars and thirty cents" is a witty remark? Husband, ah!</p>
<p>I love literature and art, but I never thought that I would rely on this little bit of "leftover heat" of loving literature and art to make a living.</p>
<p>(Appendix) My unworthy son "Shanghai" has long declared that he has severed ties, but he was "kidnapped" by the nanny for sixteen copper coins a pound. After all, "love for one's child is deep," and I couldn't bear to see "scabby head" suffer this misfortune, so I dragged a "dog's tail" after "Dogs and Chinese." Now, thanks to the benevolent gentlemen from all walks of life who have heard the news and informed me, I have been able to "reunite with my flesh and blood." I am extremely grateful and admiring. Now, I will list the titles to praise their benevolence, and I apologize for not being able to visit and thank them one by one. (The "A" on the dog's tail on A9 of Sanma Road was misprinted as "V". If there are any missing letters, this is not an exception.)</p>

<p>— Mandy</p>
<p>"Are you making fun of me? You don't understand me at all! Heavens, even my friends are finding it hard to deal with me!"</p>
<p>He misunderstood, or perhaps my words were wrong. But his words were truly like a bolt from the blue to me. "You misunderstand. I do understand you. Our lives are indeed playing out a tragedy, but we should use reason to confront our fate. If we let our emotions run wild, we will only become prisoners of fate. What good is that?"</p>
<p>"However, the political environment gives me five parts of stimulation, the social environment gives me five parts of stimulation, and I can't bear it anymore. Now my lover gives me a large portion of stimulation again. What power does my reason have to overcome it? My brain is full of stimulation, my blood vessels are full of stimulation, my whole being will be crushed by this demon of stimulation. If you don't commit suicide, you will be bitten to death by that demon!"</p>
<p>"The stimulation your lover gave you this time was brought on by yourself."</p>
<p>"I brought it on myself?" He stared at me harshly, as if losing his mind.</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "you brought it on yourself. She once told me that she knew you were living a life of boredom and distress, but you didn't tell her what was causing your boredom and distress. She didn't know what kind of words would truly comfort your heart, so she was living a life of worry and unease. Why do you have to be so proud towards your lover? Why don't you tell her the heartfelt words of your boredom and distress, so she can say words of comfort to you? She doesn't understand you, and you are the one who prevents her from understanding you. How can she live with you?"</p>
<p>"She is dissatisfied with politics! I have discussed politics with her, but she doesn't like to listen; she says it gives her a headache. She is an extreme hedonist! What I love about her is that she has a pure soul, a beautiful body, and the talent to handle matters. What does it matter if she dislikes politics? Unexpectedly, unexpectedly, it has led to mutual pain! She doesn't understand political thought, therefore she doesn't understand the distress I get from political thought. And I, I don't want her to understand political thought, so as not to engrave indelible and unavoidable scars on her pure soul. Thus, just like that, good in worry and unease, I am in boredom and distress... it turns out it's my fault! But, it's not that I don't let her understand me, it's because I love her that I don't want her to taste the cup of bitterness! And she, she doesn't understand my love, she left me, she's gone! Alas!"</p>
<p>After that, he went to your house, but you didn't see him, and you left Shanghai for a distant place. Why didn't you even see him? Now he is even more "abnormal". In the lecture hall, he talks to students about "literature" but elaborately tells the story of Flaubert's "Madame Bovary" to discuss women's psychology, and nitpicks on the story of Ibsen's play "Nora" to discuss women's character. His conclusion is the same as that of Christians, teaching students that it's best not to marry or fall in love with women. Look, is he an ascetic? No. He is reacting against women because of heartbreak!</p>
<p>He is drinking even more now, at least five or six bottles each time, not stopping until he is drunk. Once he is drunk, all sorts of shocking complaints pour out of his mouth like a torrent. He speaks frankly about his dissatisfaction with politics, his hatred for society, and the misdeeds of so-and-so. He is a person who has lost his heart!</p>

<p>Director Aspects of "Dinner Party": Shi Dongshan, Ying Yunwei</p>
<p>"Dinner Party" has excited many Shanghai movie fans because of its list of eight famous stars. As in other countries, it has also won a lot of praise, and it seems to be a rare treasure in the film industry. Precisely because it is so valued, precisely because it has a higher evaluation, then, people who go to appreciate it with great hope may be disappointed to some extent.</p>
<p>The director of "Dinner Party" is George Cukor (G. Gukor), who is considered a prestigious artist in Hollywood. His "War and Chastity" and "David Copperfield" have always left a deep impression on people.</p>
<p>From an artistic point of view, his works, from the title to the color of the play, have his own achievements. After sound films completely seized the film market, old writers fell one after another, but Cukor went from stage to screen and became an achiever among new artists.</p>
<p>Regarding his style, generally speaking, his works are very clear and also have a free and easy style. In some cases, it is similar to W. Dedare's works. His works are loved by general adults, especially intellectuals in the city, who are more easily moved by his works. Conversely, people who like Tom Mix and the like are definitely not understanders of his works. In his works, there are few Speedy Climaxes, but his clear spring-like fluent technique is very refined and brisk, but it does not flow into frivolity. Therefore, in the hearts of happy people, a certain bright Touch is left for a long time, overflowing with a clear and happy mood. In "Dinner Party", we will not ignore these advantages either, that is to say, his special technique is still clearly unfolding.</p>
<p>However, in "Dinner Party", we cannot agree that he cannot eliminate the stage techniques, dividing a play into several paragraphs, although using chimes to explain the passage of time, the explanation of time is always unclear. In fact, many people think that these are not events that happened in one day.</p>
<p>Of course, we don't say that we forgive his stage skills because he was originally a stage person, but the main reason is that since so many big stars are suddenly put together, each big star must have the opportunity to perform. Therefore, in order to distribute them relatively evenly, in order to make positions for a large number of stars to express themselves, it has almost formed a variety show-style performance for each.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if people think that this is something with great significance, and that these few stars are needed to perform from an artistic point of view, then we will never ignore the great spirit of American films. However, the fact is not like this. Obviously, it is the entrepreneurs who are trying to make a final struggle, and trying to use the names of big stars to call on a large number of movie fans.</p>
<p>Since the motive of the producer is like this, and the short-sighted vision is only focused on a large amount of money, then we feel that this injection for neurasthenia is a bit ridiculous. And from an artistic point of view, one cannot help but sigh because of it.</p>
<p>Indeed, after the luxurious banquet of "Dinner Party", the hypocrisy and selfishness of the Americans are exposed, and the collapse of American capitalist society is even more exposed. After we recognize the decisive significance of this, we will not ignore the playwright's frank attitude. From the point of view of the consistent whitewashing of peace by American artists, this attitude is indeed quite commendable.</p>
<p>"Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die!" When the group of gentlemen and ladies walked to the dining room, we heard this terrible saying. When they have fallen to the last step, naturally this sentence can intoxicate noble people. But what will the group of small property owners feel, who feel the horror of decline on the one hand, and yearn for the bright future on the other? "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die!" These negative words are precisely the dirge before entering the grave, before the grave. I hope we will cheer up. (This article was written by Ling He, and the previous section was added with my own opinions. It is noted to clarify responsibility.)</p>
<h3 id="e279">Movies and the Countryside <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Movies, undoubtedly, are not a purely entertaining tool, and all the pictures on the screen, directly and indirectly, are enough to influence the audience's thoughts and life. In the past, the only purpose of general film companies was business. As long as a film can attract the audience, the material taken, whether it is humble and filthy, and enough to influence the audience, the company does not care about anything. But now, some film companies have realized that the film itself, in addition to providing entertainment, also has the important significance of helping education and improving life, so the style has gradually changed. Recently, a part of the film styles in various countries have paid attention to the trend of the countryside. Indeed, movies and the countryside have a close relationship!</p>
<p>The United States is an advanced country in the film industry. The power of American films occupies the most important position in the world. But we feel that American films in the past had a major drawback, that is, at least nine out of ten films describe urban life. Songs, dances, grand hotels, dance halls, everything is nothing but a microcosm of urban life. However, these decadent urban lives are put on the screen, which is harmful and useless to the audience. But recently, several companies in the United States have changed their style. On the one hand, although they do not completely abandon the depiction of urban life, on the other hand, they pay attention to shooting more films of the current situation in the countryside and the lives of farmers. When the film is screened on the screen, in addition to the depiction of the city, the audience can also see the reality of the countryside. It is not monotonous and boring, and at the same time, it can arouse the audience's interest in rural life and increase their understanding of the current situation in the countryside. In the United States, which is in the revival movement, it is also actively promoting the revival of the agricultural movement, then asking the public to sympathize with the revival of agriculture, the film is naturally an important help, no wonder American film companies want to change their ways and pay attention to films depicting the current situation in the countryside!</p>
<p>Secondly, when we look at Soviet Russia, after the implementation of the New Economic Policy, Soviet Russia vigorously encouraged and promoted the promotion of production. To encourage and promote, film is naturally the best tool, and the use of film by Soviet Russia as a tool for promotion and encouragement is used in another way and another means, which is different from other countries. And what they pay the most attention to is to make films go to the countryside. On the one hand, it has the nature of preaching, and at the same time, it is also instilling agricultural knowledge! The result of preaching, undoubtedly, is to try to make the people of the whole of Russia loyal to the Soviet government; and the result of instilling agricultural knowledge, in the production and economic aspects of Soviet Russia, can naturally get a lot of gains. The method they take is to put the current situation of the countryside and the life of the countryside on the screen and show it in the city, so that people in the city have a deep understanding of everything in the countryside; and on the other hand, they put the application of various new agricultural tools and the achievements of the implementation of collectivized agricultural areas on the film, and use film touring cars to show it in various rural areas, directly and indirectly, can increase the knowledge of farmers. We feel that Soviet Russia's use of film to increase agricultural knowledge is indeed a lot to be learned from.</p>
<p>Recently, in China, the cry of rural bankruptcy has been heard all over the country. But the people in the city are still enjoying themselves and do not know the suffering of the farmers. The film industry must naturally take on the mission of rescuing the countryside, so I think that Chinese film companies should shoot more films about depicting the actual situation in the countryside and the actual life of farmers so that people in the city know that the countryside is bankrupt and the farmers are about to be unable to live. However, we check the facts of the past, and in general, film companies have shot very few films depicting the rural economy and the lives of farmers. Occasionally, a few films take the countryside as the background, but they cannot deeply describe the phenomenon of the countryside. In fact, in China, where capital is very weak and art is very immature, if film companies shoot more films about rural reality, it is not only more meaningful, but also because there is nature as a background, and the clothes of the actors are also rough and simple, and very economical. Then, why don't we shoot more of the rural reality films that are meaningful and economical, and instead shoot films that depict urban life and deformed society?</p>
<h3 id="e280">Snippets of Nanyang Film Industry <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Chunlei</p>
<p>The Shanghai film industry is to Nanyang what the Hollywood film industry is to Shanghai, a large sales market. But recently, there has been a slight change, because most of the film companies in Shanghai have been converted to sound films. The dialogue of this sound film is Mandarin, and 99% of the overseas Chinese in Nanyang are Cantonese compatriots, they do not understand Mandarin, naturally their interest in sound films has been reduced a lot.</p>
<p>Therefore, some Cantonese films have emerged in response to the situation, such as "Conscience", "Platinum Dragon", "Broken Heart Monument", "Weeping Flowers", etc., which are quite in line with the taste. However, most of these Cantonese films are adaptations of old stage classical plays, lacking a realistic form and content; moreover, the output is not much, and the supply cannot meet the demand. Under such circumstances, overseas Chinese have the motive to establish film companies. After many preparations, not long ago, a Siam United Film Company was established in Siam.</p>
<p>Last month, when I returned to the south via Hong Kong for business, I watched a premiere of this company's work "Mekong Love Waves" at the Central Grand Theater.</p>
<p>This is a sound film with pure Cantonese dialogue. The content is a love story, and the background is several overseas Chinese men on the banks of the Mekong River: Yuan Shao de and the heroine Hu Jun Shao. Hong Kong has a lot of praise for it. Personally, I think that in addition to the sound recording and photography, which have quite considerable achievements, the consciousness of its content is not very desirable. But since it is a premiere work, a little immaturity is excusable. Moreover, it is the pioneer of Chinese people running artistic enterprises overseas, and its spirit is even more commendable.</p>
<p>This company is located in Bangkok, Siam, and the manager is Li Kunlin. When it was first established, it was supported by local overseas Chinese, the education sector, and the Siamese government. The radio it uses is produced by the American Western Electric Company. It is said that it was purchased with the help of the King of Siam.</p>

<p>Xue Juexian of the Southern Company returned to Shanghai last month after being urged by Shao Zuiweng of Tianyi, and continued to cooperate in shooting the second sound film. In addition to his wife Tang Xueqing and his brother-in-law Jueming, Xue also hired Cantonese music masters Yin Zizhong, Chen Shao, Feng Weipei, and Ye Ketian to come with him. However, because Xue's old illness relapsed when he first arrived in Shanghai, and at the same time, the selection of the two plays "Poisonous Rose" and "Hate Not Meeting When Unmarried" was difficult to realize, which delayed the time. It has now been decided to produce the play "Singing Stage Love History" recently written by Xue, which will be directed by Shao Zuiweng. In view of the recent cold weather, Shao specially built another dressing room in the photography field for the film, with perfect heating equipment, for Xue to rest when filming. It is currently under construction day and night, and it is expected to start work in about three or four days, and it is expected to be completed in about a month. (But pay)</p>

<p>Roche called Tex over and asked, "Hello, Tex, who is that kid on the edge?" Tex thought he was joking with her, and she said, "I've been wondering about it since you sent her over. But Judge Li Qi wanted to reward her with a bracelet, but she didn't want it and sent the bracelet back. She's also a little fool. You sent her here, don't you even know her name?" Roche looked at the girl carefully again, and suddenly remembered and said, "Oh... that's Qiong Huilan. I said why she doesn't look like someone from your place." Tex sat up straight, with one hand on her hip, and said to Roche, "Mr. Roche, please take care of your reputation." Roche said, "Don't worry about reputation or not, you will send her here when this performance is over!"</p>
<p>After a while, the exquisite and lively Qiong Huilan came. She sat next to Roche, her golden eyes very kindly facing Roche. She said, "Frank, I can't believe it. We haven't seen each other for a long time, and I don't know how many years it has been." Roche smiled at her and said, "Then why don't we have a drink and catch up, okay?" Qiong said: "Thank you, I don't drink. But I want to see you and thank you for all your kindness to me." Roche looked her up and down, with a look of joy on his face, so he asked her to change her clothes and take her to play elsewhere. The play that Roche said was out of the nightclub, and then took her to his own luxuriously decorated apartment. The apartment where the gang lived was originally a very dangerous place. If something happened, there would be no response to shouting. And it is also specially designed for women who nod up and down, but do not shake left and right. Qiong entered Roche's bedroom, and he locked the door behind him. Qiong Lanhu is the first time to a men's apartment, and this is at night, so although she is talking and laughing, she can't help but feel a little uneasy in her heart. She looked around, and the room, in addition to a gramophone, radio, and wine cabinet, also had a double bed.</p>
<p>She took off her coat and sat on the bed unconsciously, unknowingly revealing her curvaceous legs. She was talking about her childhood situation and everything in the nightclub, even the fact that Judge Li Qi sent her a bracelet. Roche took a few kinds of wine from the wine cabinet and mixed them, shook two cocktails, and asked her, "Didn't you say that you returned the bracelet to him later?" Qiong Huilan said, "Of course, I returned it to him." Roche said, "That's okay too." He turned on the radio, took two cocktails, walked to Qiong Huilan's side, and sat on the bed with her, their bodies tightly close together. He handed a cocktail to Qiong Huilan, but Qiong shook her head and said that she never drinks. Roche said, "It doesn't matter if you only drink once. This wine is not fierce either." Qiong said, "If you insist on me drinking it." So they touched their glasses and drank the wine. After a while, Roche asked her if she wanted to drink again. This time Qiong insisted on not drinking anymore. They were still sitting on the bed tightly close together. Roche asked, "Did you really return that bracelet?" Qiong Huilan said, "Of course, how can I take other people's things for nothing without giving them anything in return?" Roche said, "But you have also received my kindness, haven't you?"
