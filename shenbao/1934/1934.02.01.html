<h3>批平史丹林報吿</h3>
<p>成</p>
<p>蘇聯共黨之獨裁者。於蘇聯共產黨第十七次大會席上。發表報吿。首先分析世界經濟現狀。次及蘇聯第一五年計劃實施以來之成績。再次對國際政治局勢。作詳盡之分析。並述明蘇聯之立塲，最後結論仍為敷陳五年計劃之實跡。而略含革命的煽動意味焉。綜觀該報吿全文。吾人於蘇聯第一五年計劃之實現。於蘇聯人民竭力以完成其豫計之理想。認其精神可作當世各國之取法。而於經濟恐慌深化之中。尤値得世界人士研究與注意焉。不過吾人尙有不能已於言者。　　第一。蘇聯自大革命以後。卽以領導世界革命自居。但自新經濟政策實施以還。已注其全力於國內經濟的建設。在表面雖仍維持世界革命之招牌。其實已從事於蘇俄本身之組織。祇須有利於蘇俄。雖任何妥恊。在所不辭。故對日可以出售中東鐵道經求和平。可以出售石油以求安定。對中歐諸國。訂立互不侵犯條約。對立於另一極端之意大利。亦可表示親善。不久以前。蘇聯認為反蘇聯領導者｜｜法蘭西。亦轉而成立互不侵犯條約。由上種種。可知蘇聯之國際的實際行動。正與其素常之理論相反對。卽此次史丹林之報吿。對此亦不無抵觸。至於歷年以來彼所分析之世界現勢。往往與事實相去甚遠。彼認為資本主義將立卽崩潰。誇大宣傳資本主義各國。將進攻蘇聯。其實資本主義各國進攻蘇聯之說。早成過去。現在事實上蘇聯皆一一與之修好矣。僅餘東方之日本尙相對立耳。如此則史氏報吿之實在性又安在耶。　　第二。史氏對中國共產黨深致滿意之報吿。尤與事實不符。夫麼三國際估量中國革命前途之錯誤。固不自今日始。因其錯誤。致更起我國之糾紛。遂有干涉我國內政之嫌疑。夫中蘇復交之初。原已申明彼此互不干涉內政。不作反對之宣傳。蘇聯對英美諸國。莫不如是。卽對遠東之日本亦然。更就事實。論例如蘇聯不能指使其黨徒在對手國內。宣傳不利於其國家之學說。及利用不合法之行動。同時對手國亦不得利用白俄以為反對蘇聯之組織及宣傳。此則人所共知者。往者蘇聯猶可借詞解釋。謂蘇聯與第三國際。原不同其範疇。共黨之組織。並不受蘇聯之指揮。以自推托。但其實蘇聯與第三國際。不特本原相同。其行動亦出一轍。當世各國亦皆明白認識。毫無疑義。不過蘇聯當局巧妙運用。不現過度露骨之痕跡耳。而此次史氏報吿。竟明白袒護中國共黨。不特袒護。甚且竭力宣揚。引為已助。此種論調。既有背於蘇聯素常所謂之和平外交。又有助長中國內亂干涉中國內政之嫌。是與復交親善之初旨。大相違背。此吾人對史氏所吿。不能不加以切實之批判也。　　吾人敢正吿史丹林氏曰。現世任何國家。皆不抺殺其以往之歷史。換言之即國與國間之界限。在短時期內殊無劃除之可能。當此民族意識盛旺之日。蘇聯亦不能不以全力從事於國防之建設。我國被各國之極度侵略。中國之出路。惟有發揮我民族固有之精神。孫中山先生早有明訓。三民主義之所昭示。在一九二七年以前。蘇聯之創造者列寗。固嘗承認之而以為正確者也。近者世事依然。次殖民地之痛苦。尤甚於往昔。史氏乃以殺人放火。鼓動農民暴動之共黨宣傳。非特其對於世界形勢之認識。已陷於機械的半面觀察。即對我中國之觀察。又曷嘗認識耶。吾不能不有詞以闢之也。</p>

<h3>美日海軍比較</h3>
<p>驅遂艦濳水艇日佔優勢</p>
<p>（東京）前於二十七日、由內田信也氏在衆議院預算總會提出質問、故由海軍方面將日本海軍第二次補充計費完成後之日美海軍實力比較問題、向預算總會發表矣、其主力艦之現勢、</p>
<p>美國為十五艘、共四五五·四○○噸、</p>
<p>日本為九艘、共二七二○七○噸、</p>
<p>至一九三六年止、軍艦年齡超過者、美國有七艘、日本四艘、因倫敦條約關係不許建造代理兵艦、故至一九三六年年底其實力、</p>

<h3>德新國會開幕</h3>
<p>希特勒敷陳政績</p>
<p>國社主義挽救國家困厄　　外交以國際和恊為基調</p>
<p>（柏林）今日為德總理希特勒執政後之一年紀念、德國國會特召集特别會議、儀節至為莊重、國會之內均吿滿座、而議會之外、人民聚集者亦滿坑滿谷、及總理行抵國會、人民均歡呼致敬、總理入國會時、全塲之人均肅立舉手、以黨禮致敬、</p>
<h3>主席致辭</h3>
<p>首由國會主席戈林將軍致詞、陳述一年以來國社黨政府所造成之成績、謂卽在極膚淺之比較上、已可發現一年以來國家各政之發展、使德國國家在國社黨首領指揮之下、不啻已如再生、再在外交方面、德國亦能以極短促之時間、使各國對於德國之企圖信仰及成就、均發生相當之敬仰、戈氏復謂、今日政府中人之全體、均屬同一政治及哲學之信仰、并同為一種工作之程序而服務、此實德國有史以來之第一遭、故德國國會此後之惟一工作、卽為將領袖希特勒所頒布之國家建設程序與以實施云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<h3>希特勒演說</h3>
<p>繼由總理希特勒登台演說、略謂世界近十五年之歷史、受兩種事實之控制、一卽國家威權為馬克思主義所破壞、一卽凡爾賽條約在政治經濟上所採之恐嚇詐騙手段、以致一般人對世界秩序、喪失信仰是也、</p>
<h3>痛惡凡爾賽約</h3>
<p>凡爾賽條約使人失去一切希望、致發生怨恨心理、德國人民對於「公理」已失信仰、對於國際現狀意存忿恨、共產黨乃乘機而起、肆其伎倆、</p>
<h3>拯人民於塗炭</h3>
<p>國家社會黨起而保障德國、使不致受共產革命之蹂躪、所以拯救德國、卽所以拯救世界全部、使不受世界革命之塗炭、</p>
<h3>民族同受尊重</h3>
<p>國家社會主義、乃「國民志願」之化身、所抱種族思想、并不蔑視其他民族、此種思想於世界和平殊有裨益、彼於戰勝國與戰敗國之間永遠施以岐視待遇者、其結果决不及種族思想之良好也、</p>
<h3>剷除階級鬥爭</h3>
<p>希特勒旋叙述</p>
<p>國社黨秉政第一年之功績、謂國社黨之志願、在取得國民全體之信賴、正惟全民予以信任、故能打破黨爭，剷除馬克思主義、吾人曾佔領各工會之會所、但其用意、乃在反對階級爭鬥、而非反對工人、</p>
<h3>鞏固宗教信仰</h3>
<p>言及宗教問題、希氏謂德國福音教各派别悉予合併、使成一種國教、此不過欲求鞏固福音教之信仰而已、但各教會對於國家社會主義之國家、亦當予以尊重也、（哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>君主制成陳跡</h3>
<p>希氏復稱、「近日國內、發生一種理想、謂德國國家非由傳統式之君王治理之、人民不能安居樂業云云、吾今日應向此種謬說提出抗議、因吾人在此一年之中、已將國家及政府之威權加以鞏固、使凡願見舊日下策之復回者、俱不得逞其志、吾人對於昔日已往之君主政治、固有相當之敬重、但國家應用何種政體治理之云云、今日已不復在討論範圍之內矣、</p>
<h3>非為經濟生存</h3>
<p>希氏繼復論及經濟問題、彼謂已往一年以來、政府所持之主觀政策為國家、並非為經濟而生存、而經濟亦决非為資本而生存者、惟經濟也資本也俱屬為國家而服務之物、（國民電）</p>
<h3>願與俄維友好</h3>
<p>言及外交問題時、希氏謂德國願與所有國家和平相與、</p>
<p>固不問其政制如何也、因此德國力謀與蘇俄保持友善關係、然共產主義在德國作宣傳、則為德國所不能容、此與國家社會主義之不見容於蘇俄、情形正同、（哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>對波拋棄夙嫌</h3>
<p>希氏對於德波間之和約、亦有意見發表、彼謂兩國之間卽有不可為諱之紛爭、亦不可卽謂無法使之和洽、凡事但在人為耳、（國民電）</p>
<h3>無意侵奧主權</h3>
<p>希氏對於德奧間問題、引為德政府之遺憾、但稱其咎不在德方面、外傳德國之侵犯奧主權云云、實屬無稽不可證實之談、於此并可知廣泛之根本思想、已彌漫於德國民族之全體、不可為國境所限制、蓋彼方之人民與吾人同一血統、同一語言、且數百年以來、彼等之國家實卽為吾人國家中不可分裂之一部份也、</p>
<h3>法德亟宜携手</h3>
<p>希氏又復稱贊德國與意大利之友誼、並盛道意相墨索里尼之功績、末謂權利平等爭執之結果、莫善於德法兩國之携手、蓋數百年來兩國之男兒、時時在疆塲流血、但終不能有根本之變動、法國自恐其國境之不保、但德國何人曾加以恐嚇者、</p>
<h3>薩爾毌庸投票</h3>
<p>且將來薩爾區域歸還德國之後、兩國間卽無復所謂國土問題之存在、故薩爾區域實有早日歸還、以使空氣早日澄清、永久和平早日成立之必要云、（國民電）</p>
<h3>英國斡旋可感</h3>
<p>希氏續稱英國允為德法兩國、居中調解、情至可感、最近英國所提之建議、德國將從長加以研究、最後希氏謂德國所以脱離國聯會及軍縮會議者、乃因德國之安全及榮譽、由此途徑、不能得到最低限度之滿足也、但德國人民、仍願盡力謀各民族之合作、希氏結論、頗受歡迎、鼓掌聲不絕、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>三讀通過</p>
<h3>改造德國法案</h3>
<p>各邦行政直轄中央</p>
<p>獨立代表制度取銷</p>
<p>（柏林）今日午後內長弗立克在國會特别會議提出之改造德國法律、業經三讀由全體一致起立表示通過、其中規定德國各邦之獨立代表制一律取銷、所有各省之統轄權完全歸於中央政府、各邦之議會一律解散、餘行政機關均隸屬柏林中央政府、弗立克一舉而將去年由希特勒總理所委任之各邦之主管長官、直接受中央統制、新律經國會通過後、立卽發生效力、</p>
<h3>英國稍釋惶慮</h3>
<p>無如希氏言行不常盡符何</p>
<p>（倫敦）昨日德總理希特勒在國會開幕時所發之演說、已使英國報紙稍釋惶慮、英報稱讚希氏希望法國捐棄舊嫌之言論、但惜希氏對奧言論、尙欠人安慰之性質、獨晨郵報對希氏言論表示疑念、謂言行不常盡符、深願希氏言出於誠、而非徒飾外交云、每日彙聞以希氏未曾言及德國復人國聯事為憾、泰晤士報稱希氏可以較前更大之自由與權力進行對內刷新對外和解之政策、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）希特勒之演詞、讚之者固不乏人、但亦有人謂德國所稱之實際的結果、亦屬悦耳之談、德國今仍有失業者六百萬人、生活至為困苦、而他國之繼續觀望、亦引起柏林許多疑懼新成立之德波互不侵犯恊定、實為希特勒之勝利、使其藉此可證實切求和平之志願第軍縮仍為衆所猜測之事件、而國社黨在奧之活動、亦為至嚴重問題、巴爾幹各邦對於德奧之爭執、現皆以深切之憂慮注視之、蓋奧國之獨立、與彼等經濟合作政治和諧計盡至有關係也、奧總理杜爾夫斯博士昨發演說、謂渠之奮鬥、乃在反對錯誤之世界觀、渠今為擁護基督主義反抗異端而戰鬥云、故外國對國社主義之德國、仍深抱不信任之觀念、固確無疑義也、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>解决軍縮難題</p>
<h3>意備忘錄內容</h3>
<p>主由尋常外交途徑</p>
<p>各國間先成立公約</p>
<p>羅馬意國備忘錄擬解决軍縮難題者、已於今日發表、內稱如時局不久稍有進步，則軍縮問題當可由各方面單獨解决之、惟在目前環境中、德國如不重置軍備、則能否獲有妥恊、殊堪疑問、故此問題在如何就恊定之範圍內維持軍備、而不容其擴大耳、意政府以為根據各國輿論所可滿意之條件、當可成立公約、約內必須包括下述四點、（一）廢除化學品戰爭、（二）禁止對於平民之轟擊、（三）照現有程度限制不受條約拘束國之軍備、（四）照現有程度限制不受條約拘束國之陸軍戰具、至於德國請求置備陸軍三十萬人一節、意政府以為鑒於各國軍備之現狀、縱允許德國要求、德國亦未必較諸英相麥唐納所提出之計畫更為優惠、意政府又以為德國海軍地位之整理、應留待下屆海軍會議討論之、意政府最後表示忠實遵守洛迦諾公約之意、並陳說目下意見交換之必要、俾可使西方各國政府之外交當局或總揆開一會議、並請有關係之他國派代表參加、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>英備忘錄</p>
<h3>未有新建議</h3>
<p>承認德軍備平等</p>
<p>切實反對試騐期</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國昨致德·法·比·美·日·等國關於軍縮之備忘錄、其內容經報紙宣布、未見有何新建議、備忘錄切實駁絕試騐時期之思想、聲明英國在原則上、承認德國之軍備平等、並建議應卽開始所謂過渡時代、在此時代內應將德國重置軍備、與他國縮减軍備事商定妥當折中計劃、又建議各國應從速組織國際管理軍備事務、據每日導報載稱、英國主張德國之挺進隊與同類組織之復員、該報雖未有批評、但希望英國備忘錄可有助於談判之進行、（三十日國民電）</p>
<h3>德交還英軍鼓</h3>
<p>歐戰時之俘獲品</p>
<p>（柏林）今午在陸軍部舉行將前於一九一四年在奧斯丹附近所掠得之英軍戈登營之軍鼓、交還英爵士漢密爾登、儀節甚為嚴肅、首由陸長白隆保演說云、對於兩軍戰士之勇敢、表示欽佩、繼由英代表漢密爾登爵士致答、略謂對於興登堡總統之槪允以前所俘之軍鼓退還、深為感激、謹代表英國軍人致謝、對於德國陸長及軍部之盛意招待、尤為銘感云、禮成後、遂卽進府晋謁興登堡總統、（三十一日國民電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）今日衆院通過文生氏之美國大海軍計劃、派造新艦一百零二艘之提案、並購置海軍飛機一千一百八十四架之修正文、此案在參院恐亦不致有反對之舉、文生氏在衆院演說時、曾謂美國海軍不及日本海軍之實力、故美國在遠東勢力亦日漸消失、且美國現在國際地位非常孤單、渠又謂在一九三五年之海軍會議、美國當格外注意、蓋此時若再不力事整頓、則美國將失却一切海軍之威權、英日兩國均按照條約規定數額極力擴充海軍之實力、目下美國情形一旦若有事變、頗難調動、文生氏在其演詞中、並極力主張總統須有全權建造新艦及修理一切陳舊軍艦云、衆議員畢立登氏係極力擁護文生氏之提案者、按畢氏亦為贊成大海軍計劃之一人、按照文生氏之提議、美國須趕造驅逐艦六十五艘·濳艇三十艘·巡洋艦六艘·及飛機母艦一艘、至於修正文則擬撥欵九千萬元、添置海軍飛機一千一百八十四架云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>明年之海軍會議</p>
<h3>恐將討論遠東問題</h3>
<p>芳澤以不開會議為上策</p>
<p>廣田企圖挽回國家信用</p>
<p>（東京）貴族院之本會議於午後一時四十分續開、前外相芳澤謙吉氏登壇發言曰、余非提出詰責式之質問者、亦非關於過去之業績有所質問、乃欲探詢政府之所抱負也、首相與外相之演說得聞命矣、可謂今後之方針、全賴外交工作以圖掃蕩荊棘而打開難局、唯茫茫前途、在在不免困難、　　明年為召開海軍軍縮會議之期、假如日美兩國均遵從海軍之意向而臨會議、如此揣想、則會議必至决裂、處此情形、據樂觀者、則謂會議雖吿决裂、亦無戰爭之憂慮、更無所謂造艦等類之竸爭、在悲觀派之論調、則以萬事均屬憂慮、然則如之何、倘召開會議以至决裂、則不如不開會議之為愈、更以先行交涉為必要、交涉之後、决定召開與否、方為穩妥、尤以不開會議為上策、蓋此事非僅日本為然、無論其為任何對手國、此項會議决無給予好結果之希望、故以不開為宜、</p>
<p>其次、明年軍縮會議或又提出極東問題亦未可知、在華府會議席上亦曾討論、有此先例故也、關於此點、政府所抱負似應决定於事前、蓋日本負有維持東洋和平之全責、固不必僅對於極東問題有所討論、至海軍問題、日本當以日本之立塲為重、倘以五五三之比率未便維持極東和平、則須要求足以維持之比率、自無待論、　　其次、為日蘇間之問題、余以為日蘇兩國間並無非以干戈相見而難解决之重大問題、蓋日蘇為昆鄰接壤之邦、至今尙未斷絕國交、且廣田外相早經聲明、以外交工作努力維持和平、余亦極表贊同、日本如以蘇俄為共產制萬難相容、則屬誤謬之見解、若蘇俄不惜戰爭、而欲完成東洋之赤化、是其無謀之甚者也、　　再論通商問題、余以為今日之情勢决非危機、且危機亦未必果來、縱使果來、當由外交工作以打開難局、倘第三國違反吾人之意志、任意挑釁、而引起戰亂之時、則處以斷然之措置可也、吾人雖至最後、亦非出以和平手段不可、關於此點、早經首相與外相聲明在案、余所欽佩者也、</p>
<p>關於日本對世界之信望消長、余覺與滿洲國有關、倘滿洲國確立安定、則日本之立塲可謂向世界大放光彩、完成滿洲之建設、則中日國交可期圓滿、今幸滿洲國着着進至完成之步驟、此則對於政府與軍部之努力、深表感謝、並望更收萬全之效果、</p>
<p>此次芳澤氏之演辭、經過一時間、方始徐步降壇、首相與外相之答辯如左、最初由廣田外相答曰、逐一奉答在所未便、恐懼之情如履薄冰、余為極東問題自覺不致發生戰爭、現今更以為無憂慮之必要、�</p>
<p>此時當以提高國家之信用為必要耳、　　齋藤首相亦有簡單之答辭、感謝芳澤氏之激勵、午後三時五分散會、（三十一日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）今日貴族院本會議關於南洋委任統治問題、廣田外相對於芳澤前外相之質問、答謂不拘泥於國聯主權說、受任國主權說、或恊約國共同主權說、主張根據大戰中之事實為基礎、係日本之領有權云云、殊堪重視、緣恊約國間、對於舊德領處分問題成立諒解時、决定將南洋諸島隸歸日本、其後在巴黎和平會議、方採取委任統治之形式、故日本對於委任統治之方針、未必滿足、惟不變更領有之實、照此解釋而承諒者、今日日本雖退出國聯、日本並不喪失領有權云、（三十一日電通電）</p>
<h3>廣田研究親美和俄政策</h3>
<p>對美重提仲裁條約</p>
<p>對俄謀設非武裝區</p>
<p>（東京）廣田外相三十日在豫算總會席上對政友會長島隆二之質問答辯、謂政府對於對美和平工作及俄滿邊境防備限制問題、現在努力研究採用有效辦法、據聞外相考慮中之對美俄方針如下、</p>
<h3>對美方針</h3>
<p>外相擬待齋藤駐</p>
<p>美大使赴任後、命其會見羅斯福總統、說明日本和平外交之方針、如得羅總統之諒解、則不辭訂立日美仲裁條約、以期實行積極和平工作、</p>
<h3>對俄方針</h3>
<p>外相認日俄關係之調整、在於先行解决兩國間懸案、故於前年俄方提議訂立不侵犯條約時、日本婉轉拒絕、然中東路再交涉之機運在近、蘇俄對日態度有軟化形勢、「滿洲國」內日俄紛爭之禍因亦可望消滅、日本為維持遠東和平起見、要求紅軍由俄滿邊境撤退、擴大檏次茅斯條約之精神、明確决定日滿俄間之國界、在國界一百五十英里以內地帶、設置非武裝地區、以免發生紛爭、日本為實現此方針、待諸懸案解决後、將提議設立國境委員會、（三十一日日聯電）</p>
<p>羅斯福正式批准</p>
<h3>貨幣案成法律</h3>
<p>全國現金悉歸國有</p>
<p>總統有權統制元價</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統貨幣法律案、經參衆兩院先後通過、本月業由總統簽署、按照此項法律、全國境內所存現金及金幣、皆歸國有、美元不能兑換現金、而美元之金價値、總統亦有權加以規定、總統現將頒行命令多則、規定貨幣法律之執行辦法、如將美元價値定為金價値百分之六十、及以二十萬萬元設立匯兑調節基金兩項、其尤要者也、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>頒布黄金條例</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統今日所發之黄金條例、准聯邦儲備銀行以金券向政府兑取黄金、其數量多少、須如財政部認為清理國際債欵及維持美國各種通貨平等購買力所必要者、銀行可在海外及美國境內購買黄金、為上述用途、黄金可保留或運送或輸入或提存或儲入對外或對內賬內、進口黄金如封存税關中運、可再出、無須領照、否則必須領照、（三十日路透電）</p>
<h3>鎊元合作可能</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日財長張伯倫氏聲明謂英國之匯兑平衡基金與美國之穩定匯兑基金、頗有合作之可能、蓋英國並非利用此基金、使英鎊有特殊之變動者也、按張伯倫氏之聲明、一則可以引英美雙方之注意、或暗中進行談判、一則足以安慰一般人之憂慮、並减少將來衡突之程度云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<h3>國內外之影響</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）本日下午經羅斯福總統簽署之貨幣法、係美國數代以來最為重要之法律、此項法律、將一九三三年三月以來、美國財政經濟組織所經過之改革、予以確認、對於美國內部經濟發展、與國際上貨幣及經濟關係、均將有非常重大之影響、新法律將新美元定為不兑現之貨幣、並將世界現金半數、卽美國公私存金全部之所有權、畀予美國國家、總統依據此法、得將貨幣在名義上所有之金成分、自由予以變更、卽國庫亦變成眞正發行紙幣銀行、而政府亦得利用二十萬萬元之匯兑調節基金、以直接干涉世界各國金融巿塲、又自上年羅斯福總統停止金本位之後、人心為之不定、以致國際貨幣及商務關係、發生重大混亂、自新法律頒布之後、此種現象、卽為之中止、惟新法律所定美元價格、顯在匯兑巿塲按照供求律自然規定價格之下、恐不免又引起一種擾亂之因素、緣美國國庫對國際金巿塲及匯兑巿塲之干涉、足使現金在世界分配不均之弊、為之加甚故也、又由經濟上言之、美元經貶價之後、美國出口商務將因之興奮、而美國失業者衆多、急於求得工作、在甚長時期以內、尙不致要求按照新美元價格提高工資、以是美貨出口業、尤為便利、惟是美國以貨幣貶價之故、而發展出口貿易、同時又將以貨幣貶價之故、而减少進口貿易、則以美元貶價、外貨價値因而加高故也、此事損及外國、殊有引起國際糾紛之虞、但在美國各債務國、則此</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>較易於償還利息、以上係就國外影響而言、若論國內、則私人債務原以金元計算現則改以貶價美元償還、一切債務自然减輕、其中受益與受害者共分兩類、如農民困於租税、各實業公司困於債券利息、均受新法律之賜、反之受害者、則為抵押貨欵之債權人、及持有公債之人、要而言之、凡從事儲蓄之中產階級、與依賴工資為生之勞動者、均受其害、蓋因工資不能隨生活程度以俱漲也、此外新貨幣制度、實含有貨幣膨脹之潛能性、尤其是放欵膨脹之濳能性、國家經濟活動、將由此而得到有力之興奮、尤其餘事、新法律在國內國外所可發生之影響、如是而已、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>內蒙請求自治問題（一續）</h3>
<p>蒙人對中央規定仍持異議｜</p>
<p>以上三階段、為黄部長與百靈廟自治會議、主席團商定蒙古自治辦法之經過情形也、茲再將該辦法內最要之點、分别說明於下、甲、關於組織之規定、係將錫林郭勒盟及察哈爾部各旗編為蒙古第一自治區、烏伊兩盟土默特阿拉善額濟納各旗編為蒙古第二自治區、各設區政府、直隸行政院、管理各本區內各盟部旗政務、遇有關涉省之事件、與省政府會商辦理、並於各自治區間設一聯合辦事處、辦理共同事宜、至各盟部旗之管轄治理權、則一律照舊」、是為蒙古所增者、不過在數盟部旗之上設一區政府耳、其權限止於管理各本區內之盟部旗、而各盟部旗自應仍管其原有之蒙民、遇有關涉省之事件、又須與省政府會商辦理、一方面沿襲舊制、順應自然、並無妨碍省縣之處、另一方面、又有區政府督促各盟部旗整理庶政團結禦侮之益、乙、關於設縣之規定、係於「蒙古各盟部旗境內、以後不得再設縣或設治局」、縣為專管內地移民之組織、已詳於前、現在內地移民繁聚之處、無不設有縣治、所有未墾地方、事實上亦不能再墾、其在未墾地方之內地商民、現在皆由附近之縣管理、自不必再增縣治、徒使蒙旗感痛苦、丙、關於土地之規定、係將「蒙古現有荒地、一律劃為蒙古牧區、永不開墾、其已墾土地、另定妥善辦法整理之、要未整理以前、蒙旗對於境內之土地礦產山林川澤等固有權、一律照舊、其向有徵收者、照舊徵收、蒙古官民原有私租、一律予以保障」蒙古現有未墾地方、多為沙漠苦寒之處、墾植旣所不宜、面積亦極有限、蒙民亦吾同胞、在其不能遽改為農之時期、自應留予維持生計之牧塲、卽以我廣大之國家而論、亦不應無相當之牧塲、以為駝馬牛羊皮毛肉酪之出產地、故應將現有荒地、一律劃為蒙古牧區、以便從改良牧畜興辦附帶工業方面、發展地方經濟、至已墾土地、各處經理之方法、旣不一致、而蒙漢民衆之爭訟迭起、亦非地方之福、故應妥定辦法、加以整理、在未整理以前、所有蒙旗及蒙古官民對於土地之原有各項權益、自應予以保障、丁、關於租税之規定、係「牧區以內各項税收、由自治區政府詳定統一辦法徵收之、其省縣設在牧區以內之税收局卡、一律取消、蒙民除對蒙旗有負担外、省縣不得再加以負担、省縣在蒙旗境內所收之土地鑛產山林川澤等租税、及其他各項税收、均由自治區政府派員會同徵收、一律平分」現在未墾地方人民之負担、輕重頗不一致、區政府成立後立後、自應設法劃一之、省縣設在未墾地方之税收局卡、為數甚少、為免除人民二重負担計、自應取消、蒙民由蒙旗管理、已有相當負担、省縣自不宜再有所取、重累人民、近年中央動謂蒙地教育實業交通等事業、均由中央撥欵辦理、其實只有口惠而實不至、且地方完全依賴中央資助、亦有未當、蒙旗對於地方税收、又有劈分先例、故欲就省縣在蒙旗境內所收之地方税收、劈分一半、以期以地方税收、建設地方事業、使蒙漢居民一同沾利益、否則蒙旗與蒙民永遠落後、亦豈地方之福、以上十四項、係百靈廟商定自治辦法之最要點、皆為基於過去慣例及現在事實之需要而定、百靈廟自治會議、最初主張統一組織蒙漢合作之高度自治、旣不能成立、所有此項區省并立分工合作之辦法、亦不失為解決蒙邊種種糾紛使蒙漢居民共存共榮之良策、</p>

<h3>外僑注意工部局議董選舉</h3>
<p>字林報云、上海工部局議董選舉、將於下月舉行、下屆議董會之組織、漸爲一般人士所注意、總董裴爾行將吿假返國、料必不願再受選舉、但聞其他英籍議董四人、卽亞賀爾德氏、（副總董）麥克那登少將、麥賽氏、與哈里斯氏、均願再爲候選員、至於美籍議董賴文氏、亦將返美、本年自不能再被選舉、故美籍候選員、聞將　佛蘭克林與卡萊二人、日籍議董船津與岡本、仍顧爲候選員云、總董一席、究將誰屬、今已爲衆討論之事件、據日文各報載稱、日籍納科人現在從事運動、謀以日紗廠聯合會之船津爲工部局總董、謂船津曾任中國多處之日總領事、且爲日紗廠聯合會之總辦、學識材能、衆所共知、而交游甚廣、在中外人中頗佔勢力、如上海日日新聞云、船津與岡本之列席工部局議董會、足以維持租界中日僑之聲望、無論如何、今以下屆工部局議董席畁之、實合於情理、該報又稱、按照習慣、總董由議董選出、往者此席爲英人所專有、（字林報按此言須加矯正、因自一九一一年起、美人曾據此席七年也、）廢除此種不適合時宜之特享權、而以此席予適當之人、今已臻其時、不得以國籍爲重也云云、就目下情勢而論、如亞賀爾德重行膺選、則可望以副總董而被舉爲總董、日僑中有勢力之份子、亦頗不以日報之主張爲然、蓋總董或須每日到局辦公、而船津則負有專門職務、不得不常離滬、若任總董、殊不方便也、</p>
<p>貿易局擬具</p>
<h3>牛隻牛肉出口意見</h3>
<p>設立農民借貨所發展牧畜</p>
<p>請專家指導農民改良畜養</p>
<p>國際貿易局、前奉實業部商業司函、爲調查吾國牛隻牛肉出口情形、並擬具意見一節、何局長自接函後、卽飭指導處進行調查、並擬具計劃、茲悉指導處已將計劃擬就、函復商業司參考、茲將所擬關於牛隻牛肉出口意見如下　、</p>
<h3>貸欵農民</h3>
<p>（一）近年農村蕭條、農民缺乏資本、如向私人借欵、利貸過重、且養牛成本較大、如能力不足、斷難畜養、欲使農村金融活動、應由地方官應撥欵、或由地方富豪集資設立農民借貸所、以低利借於農民、至出產時歸還農民有資本、俾得發展牧畜、增加產額、</p>
<h3>預防牛病</h3>
<p>（二）鄕間缺乏獸醫、如遇牛瘟、或其他疾病、農民袖手待斃、養牛成本旣大、牛之生死、於農民之關係非淺、故爲預防牛病、必須由地方官廳派獸醫到養牛區視察、或設立小規模之獸醫院、診治獸病、以發展畜牧業、</p>
<h3>組合作社</h3>
<p>（三）牛之交易、由牛販到農家收買、轉販於牛行、由牛行再販賣於出口商、此種間接貿易、由養牛者至出口商經過數次轉遞、中間剝蝕以多、且牛商常壟斷價格、牛販故意抑價、從中圖利、農民損失不小、欲免除買賣不公、地方官廳、可召集畜牛農民、組織販賣合作社、共同販賣、旣便利又經濟、</p>
<h3>改良畜養</h3>
<p>（四）我國畜牧法、陳腐不知改良、對於牛之食料及牛房、均無研究、因此牛瘦多病死傷者不知若干、地方官廳應聘請專家指導農民、以科學方法、改良畜養、務使菜牛體肥、耕牛强壯、以增加牛產額、（五）近年各地牧畜塲漸多、惟畜牧人才及獸醫太少、以後應辦學校、造就此項專門人才、以改良發展畜牧業、</p>

<h3>五洲製藥新廠</h3>
<p>創製甘油出品精良</p>
<p>機械完備前途遠大</p>
<p>本埠五洲大藥房所設立五洲固本皂廠、爲我國規模最大之製皂製藥工廠、廠址在滬西徐家匯、該公司最近又在西區安和寺路、擴充第二製藥廠、利用製皂廢料、精煉甘油、於今年元旦開始製煉、出品精良、昨日下午、邀各報社記者參觀兩廠五洲第二製藥廠</p>
<p>、午刻、假華安大樓歡宴、報吿設廠籌備經過、各情分誌于次、</p>
<h3>報吿經過</h3>
<p>昨日五洲藥房假座靜安寺路華安大樓、招待記者、到各報社記者二十餘人、席聞由該公司常務董事高翰卿·盧志學·總經理項繩武·相繼報吿、略謂、五洲藥房開設已久、前在歐戰之後、由德購辦機械、製造固本肥皂、當時雖有資本雄厚之上海製皂公司之竸爭、但卒以品質優良、而獲得一般之信仰、故年來營業尙佳、惟製皂時、其用以洗浄石灰之皂之涵液、原屬廢物、祇以其中尙含有甘油之原料、公司方面、爲减輕成本起見、决用化學方法、將此滴液、加以製煉、當時卽派張輔忠君赴德學習、現經七年之研究、始於去年返國、主持甘油廠、其機械亦係德國出品、爲一九三一式、在東亞爲最新之機械、每日可產純油二噸、至我國每年之需用量、約爲五百萬至一千萬噸、茲本廠所產年僅五六十萬噸、如國人能竸相購用、則本廠當可再事擴充、以增加生產云、餐後、由公司備車、送往兩廠參觀、新廠佔地約十畝許、舊廠約三十餘畝、設備異常完全、記者對於該公司在此提倡國貨之時、有此宏大之設備、十分欽佩、茲就觀感所及、略述如下、</p>
<h3>五洲第二製藥廠</h3>
<h3>甘油功用</h3>
<p>甘油在一百九十年前、爲瑞典藥師許蘭所發現、初時以製法不良、祇爲葡萄酒調與味藥物之、用、自一八六七年、經諾貝爾將硝甘油製成炸藥後、甘油乃爲舉世所重視、此因炸藥不僅爲爭城殺人之破壞物、在創造現代文明之開鑛闢路、亦爲必需品、最近用於化妝品飲食物紡織業印刷術烟草工業、頗爲不少、冬令飛艇與汽車、用甘油以防凍、應用範圍、因而日廣、顧我國至今尙無人製造、該公司有鑒於斯、購買德國最新機器、聘任專門技師張輔忠君利用固本皂廠之涵液、製造甘油、經營年餘、業於本年元旦開工、所得甘油之品質、駕乎舶來品之上、</p>
<h3>設備原因</h3>
<p>該公司之皂藥廠各種出品、成績優良、暢行全國、尤以家用皂一項、因質净耐用、超越凡羣、故信譽最著、惟其所用原料、如牛油·桕油·等、悉爲國產、較諸他家採用劣質原料製皂者、成本不啻倍蓗、該公司爲减輕製皂成本起見、决定將製皂時分泌出之廢料、用化學方法、練成精製甘油、</p>
<h3>甘油工塲之一角</h3>
<h3>機械設備</h3>
<p>該廠之佈置完全新式、滷液盛於地窖、用時由吸機打入極大之鐵桶、行化學清潔法甘油工塲之一角後、轉入房屋高層之存貯箱、使自然流下而濾過之、再用化學藥品、除去雜質、由是所得清潔之液體、在眞空蒸發、裝置蒸濃、其裝置爲雙重效能式、附屬之件、不一其類、所得粗甘油、用眞空蒸溜、其裝置之結構、頗爲複雜、蒸發與蒸溜用之抽空機、爲乾燥式、形狀偉大、再經脱色、則爲潔白之甘油、熱力有大小二鍋爐、大者爲管子鍋爐、小者爲循環式高壓蒸氣鍋爐、其凝集水、仍回至此鍋爐內、故熱量節省不少、原動力用電力、自設方棚間、先轉成各種電位、而分配各部用水源取自自流井、吸水機水池塔、連接用自動電機開關、廠中各項管子、均有色别存貯箱、吸機與各開關之地位、處處顧及、工作效能、誠爲滬江化學工廠之模範也、該廠佔地十畝、除製造甘油部分外、擬附設注射針藥廠、用最新方法、</p>
<p>製造各種針藥、該處地點幽靜、空氣清潔、以之製高貴藥品、極爲相宜、預料該公司針藥出世之日、定爲醫藥界放一異彩云、</p>

<p>蘇州旅滬巨商周渭石、　曾名重一時、經蘇人推爲旅滬同鄕會會長等職、現雖年老退休、而其所手創之業、依然蒸蒸日上、故所擁資產甚豐、地皮房屋之外、並仍經營周耕記紗花號、膝下兒孫環繞、頗有含貽之樂、惟其長子蕚軒·次子讀軒、似無乃父勤儉之風、輒作任情揮霍之舉、讀軒之爲人、凡曾閱歇浦潮說部者、類能道之、茲雖年歲稍長、故態未改、蕚軒弱冠時尤喜走馬章臺、自來鴇兒愛鈔、姐兒愛俏、彼貌旣姣好、財復豐富、曲院勾欄、莫不爭繫遊騦、剪燭留髠、民國十三年、有名妓、</p>
<h3>紅樓老四</h3>
<p>者、其時芳齡正二九、次蕚軒一歲、邂逅相逢、宛如舊識、筵前燈畔、互訴相思、未幾而花開並蒂、未幾而暗結珠胎、惟是腹漸澎亭、旁觀譏誚、老四自知淫業大受影響、蕚軒亦心良不忍、徒以椿萱管束綦嚴、納妓絕對不許、致未敢作珠量之計、權效狡兎之謀、賃就小房子、深藏大肚皮、迨至呱呱墮地、居然慶洽弄璋、無父之兒、亦幸有父、而老四從此拋却青樓、一意</p>
<h3>撫育黄口</h3>
<p>詎此好事無常、歡塲易散、爲時未久、蕚軒之秘密、盡爲其父母偵知、某日、瞰老四携雛離家、二老不動聲色、同往蕚軒藏嬌之淡水路興隆坊八號、將所有傢具、搬運一空、覆巢之下、完卵雖得倖存、然樓身則已無所、蕚軒縱富愛情、難違嚴命、不敢爲孟母之三遷、惟有運慧劍之一斬、伯勞飛燕、各自東西、孤雛暫仍由老四撫育、應需生活之資、由蕚軒按月支給、於此措置、旣安父母之心、亦予愛人出路、惟蕚軒經此挫折、纔悟情海卽是恨海、自是</p>

<h3>讀書與低級趣味（一）</h3>
<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>首先向你們的工作，表示十分的同情並敬意。</p>
<p>根據連日在「讀書問答」欄內解答的問題，我雖然非常同意，也認爲是很重要的，但是我仍感覺貴部指導的標凖提得太高。就是貴部目下所吸收的尙是一般已有相當覺悟的青年而不是眞正的上海廣大的店員學徒層。像貴部半月來發表的讀者來信，雖然有時亦現出稚態可笑的言論，但大致是有了幾分覺悟，或者脱離學校不久，本來是很清白的青年，他們能知道自已的弱點，不滿足所處的近却，他們時時是在求出路，找光明，更迫切的祈求新的啓示，新的奮鬥手段。所以他們一見你們設了「讀書問答」說能提出一些問題、前來求救。你以爲他們就是上海小店員學徒的典型人物嗎？先生！那你就完全錯了。不：他們在廣大學徒店員羣中好比「鳳毛麟角」啊！我敢向先生說，現在店員學徒中看不慣，看不懂，不關心「讀書問答」的要占百分之九十喲！　譬如我們店裏，看這一欄的人，除了我以外就只有一位「小開」。他也不過是好奇而已，並不想在這裏面學點什麼的。</p>
<p>以外的人就不要讀點什麼嗎？不！他們在閑時手裏也拿着東西讀。他們仍然需要讀。你問他們讀的什麼嗎？喲喲！他們讀的是那些專門賣弄社會新聞的低級報紙及二三種「所謂文丐」的小報一般的報屁股。看後笑哈哈，一點不關心的就完事。他們也看書，但大致是舊小說：武俠，神怪，肉麻的才子佳人的鴛鴦蝴蝶之作。新的東西：最流行的是「啼笑姻緣」「似水流年」，「苔莉」「情書一束」「性史」「性藝」「紅花瓶」，以外的東西，在他們眼裏一槪視爲無物了。他們都沉淪在低級趣味中。　　自然，我也是從他們那種生活中間的過來人，我知道很清楚。我近兩年在一些較高級的雜誌報紙上看了許多批評低級趣味的文字，使我吃了一驚，原來自已正沉溺在這苦海中不能自拔。因爲得了這點啓示，我對那些舊的糧食感到不滿足了。我要要求新的糧食。　但是，舊的糧食的不衛生雖然明明知道，却還不知道如何去撮取新的糧食，我們在岐途上徬徨。（未完）</p>

<h3>悶幹和苦幹</h3>
<p>— �</p>
<p>如果有人問：「世界上那一國的人，心思最巧？口才最好？」我便當毫不遲疑的答道：「自然是我們中國人囉！」同時我還感覺到中國人的心思巧，口才好，不懂祇是一椿現在的事實，而已成爲一種民族的特性。但看那一個機關裏設有幾個名目怪好聽的委員會；那一位大人先生不會唱幾句字正腔圓的高調；便是一個極顯明的鐵證！尤其是委員會的名目竟能時時變換，層出不窮，高調的辭句，也往往推陳出新，無一雷同，更足令東西洋各國人士，一致拜倒，確爲中華民族之無上光榮。</p>
<p>最近，有某某幾位大人先生的口角上又發明了兩句高調：一句是「悶幹」，一句是「苦幹」。一時鷄犬之流，羣相倣傚，端的山鳴谷應，響徹天地；我想如其我們這些蚩蚩愚氓，個個眞能把這兩句「藥石之言」服服從從地喝下去，中國便多分有救了！</p>
<p>理由如下：</p>
<p>「悶幹」這一句話的意思，便是說，此刻在幹着的人，因爲種種的困難和顧忌，或竟可說是欲求速效起見，不得不藏頭縮尾的在暗中努力，有時雖然很想把他所以如此幹的理由給看的人解釋，但因不願給第三者注意，便只得悶聲不響，自管自的幹；反過來說：就是看的人對</p>
<p>於幹的人千萬不要發什麼疑問，儘管聽他們自由自在的幹去；那末幹的人便可放心托胆的一味悶幹，幹到某一個結果爲止，而中國的出路，便無論如何可以解决了！　　至於「苦幹」呢，那是更有價値了！因爲我們都知道中國現在的社會狀態是非常的不安定，而所以不安定的原故就爲有的人太得意，有的人太不得意，因此互相傾軋，發生種種的不幸。如果大家都能實行「苦幹」，那末被壓迫的人自然會依舊馴馴服服地去做牛做馬了；而已經做官，已經發財的人的地位，硬從此可以穩定了。這樣「悶幹」，「苦幹」的分别幹下去，自然會達到盜賊不興，外户不閉的太平景象了！中國也萬無不强盛之理了！　　要如還有不明白我的話，我還可以說透澈一些。就是一個已經從開賭塲上發財的人往往會主張嚴禁賭博，并請人家不要調查他的家產的來歷；其心理正與高唱「悶幹」「苦幹」的大人先生們同。</p>
<p>，這條路上，滿佈着異國小英雄的蹤跡，我再看看他們的服裝和氣槪，不由得你不佩服。他們上身穿一件短大衣，裏頭襯着薄薄的綫衫。下身是呢的短褲，一雙脚蓋，仍是露出在外邊。這是男孩子的服裝。女的呢，披着短髮，敞着胸口，短大衣，長襪和短褲。在這寒風凛冽中，雄糾糾，氣昂昂，大踏步的走着，一些没有縮頸袖手，畏怕寒冷的神氣。看看他們的面色，個個紅潤而結實。看看他們的舉止，又是活潑而勇武。我不禁暗暗的讚着：「小英雄：眞是小英雄！」　　走着，走着。我心裏在想：「這裏有我們的小孩子，也有我們辦的小學校，爲甚麼不瞧見咱們的小英雄呢？難道他們都怕冷而縮在被窩子裏嗎？不！我想决不會這樣的。」</p>
<p>來了！咱們的小英雄來了！這位小學生，他的家庭，一定是一個小布爾喬亞的階級，因爲有一個年老的娘姨跟着，還替他提了書包。再看這位小英雄的打扮，外邊裹了一件厚呢的大衣，拖到脚背。裏邊厚厚的，不知甚麼衣服，想必總是皮袍子·絲棉襖等。脚上一雙厚絨鞋，頭上一頂呂宋帽，邊沿拉下來，祇露着眼和鼻在外面。我看了他這付臃腫遲鈍的打扮，眞像一個矮冬瓜一般，不由得心中暗暗的吃驚。未來的主人翁，未來的大國民，現在這般的嬌生慣養，</p>
<h3>寳帶橋小於垂虹橋</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>蘇嘉汽車道中最秀麗代靈的地方，要算寳帶橋了。一面是波平如鏡的澹臺湖，一面是帆檣相望的運漕河，還可以遠望上方山，聳起筆一般的一座小塔。本來這寳帶橋上，要是風大些，連徒手而行也不甚安全，如何可以通行汽車。所以通行汽車，另外造一條木橋，和寳帶橋成並行綫，高度也差不多，也算特别的建置了。　　蘇州人說，寳帶橋的橋洞，是數不清的。因爲只有在船裏遠數，還可以，但是容易眼花。其實是五十三洞，在江南自然也稱得偉大的建築物了。不過我看見宋人筆記說，寳帶橋一名「小長橋」。那麼有小必有大，大長橋在那裏呢？這個須得我來解釋了。原來吳江縣城東有一條垂虹橋，比寳帶橋還要長，所以至令吳江人都稱他「長橋」。畢竟長橋有若于橋洞？志書上没有說明，（宋錢公輔利往橋記說是「東西千餘尺，巿木萬計」。大約是木橋，千餘尺當然長於寳帶了）。不過年深月久，大半污塞了。他的一端，已成了陸地，就是縣政府門前的看波橋。一座石碑樓，和現在那一端巍立的一般體制，足以證明是東西對峙，和寳帶橋兩端的石獅子，同是長橋的裝飾。</p>
<p>我在故宮週刋上，看見宋無名畫家畫了一柄圓扇，是垂虹圖，也是蜿蜒臥波，左右水天無際，比寳帶橋更確是偉大些。就是這點看來，垂虹橋在當時眞的比寳帶橋爲長了。　　這些無關宏詣的考古，有什麼用處？</p>
<p>可是就垂虹橋漸次污塞上看去，太湖的滄桑變幻，眞是可驚。偉大的建築物，不能亘久，姜白石大雪中過垂虹詩：「自琢新詞韻最嬌，小紅低唱我吹簫，曲終過盡松陵路，廻首烟波第四橋。」至今烟波無恙，而風流老去，怎麼不令人感慨呢？</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>眞的愛：是不能用筆墨來描寫，言語來形容，動作來表示的。苟合和婚姻，有什麼兩樣？不過前者是秘密的公開；後者是公開的秘密。　　「文章自家好，老婆人家好！」可是在</p>
<p>情人眼中，另有看法！因老婆有未必是情人；情人也有未必是老婆。</p>
<p>「戲法人人會變，巧妙各有不同。」據說戀愛之道亦猶是！</p>
<p>社交不妨公開，愛情切莫濫施！</p>
<p>不再是「痴心女子負心漢」，如今年頭兒，却要顚倒過來了。</p>
<h3>咱們的小英雄</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>在早上八點鐘的時候，我在北四川路走着。天氣實在太冷了，道旁的積水，給冷風一吹，結成像水晶般的冰塊。柏油的路面，也凝結得像鐵板般堅硬，踏上去使溫軟的棉鞋，也失去它的效能。這時兩旁的店舖，大半没有開門。馬路上祇有電車和公共汽車行着，稀稀落落的祇有幾位乘客。　　過了老靶子路，馬路上走的人多了，三三兩兩，都是上學去的學生。我仔細一看，日本小孩子也有，西洋小孩子也有。晤！不錯！在北四川路的盡頭，有一所西童學校。在橫浜橋的北首，有一所日本小學。所以在早上·午時·傍晚將來怎樣肩負起家國的重任呢？咳！咱們的小英雄。</p>
<p>我走着走着，心裏在想：「人家是拚命地養成勇武的國民，在世界舞台上爭雄逞强；我們是在養成多愁多病的公子哥兒，預備將來演「中狀元·私訂終身等把戲。」大同的世界，和平的世界，快快的呈現，否則我們的國民，怎樣和他們周旋呢？</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十二回</p>
<p>創痛難堪凝神聽鼓樂</p>
<p>歡情未洽促别到飛符</p>
<p>桂枝已經是洗完了臉，用雪花膏在臉上抺着呢，這說笑道：我是個舊式女子，你說的這些話，我可不懂。趙自强笑道：你不懂？你比我聰明多着呢。哈哈！你錯了，怎麼把粉撲子在胭脂膏的小盒子上擦着呢。桂枝回頭看時，自已可不是把粉撲子在胭脂膏上按着嗎？？笑道：我眞有點荒唐。這要把粉撲子向臉上一塗，可就成了關二爺了。兩人說着，哈哈大笑。這時，江氏到後面院子來，正有兩句話。想和女兒說。因爲女兒在新房没有出來，自已也不便衝了進去，這就在趙翁房門口站住着。趙翁迎了出來道：老太太，有什麼話說嗎？江氏道：我找我們姑娘說一句話。他在新房裏和姑爺說的挺熱鬧，我就不去打岔了。趙翁笑道：老太太總是這樣的疼兒女。江氏笑道：不是那話，我們作上入的，有個不願他夫妻兩口子和和氣氣的嗎？趙翁手摸了鬍子，點點頭，也就没有向下說。自然江氏不便把這些兒女私親的話，對了親家翁儘是談，說了幾句閑話，也就走了。家常的話，也不見得十分緊要，今晚來不及說，還有明天呢，明天來不及說，還有明天晚上呢。然而江氏這種猜想，却是不大相符，桂枝除了出來吃兩餐飯，總是在新房裏，江氏要想說話，總是没有機會。他心裏也就想着，姑娘已經嫁過去五天了，雖然新婚夫妻應該十分甜蜜，可也不當甜蜜到這種樣子，不要是另有别的原故吧？（二三六）</p>

<h3>三個大除夕（下）</h3>
<p>— 愼言</p>
<p>「這這算得什麼呢」！程元很不介意地答應着。恰好有一個小癟三走來向他討錢，他便隨手掏出了五六個銅元來丢將過去。</p>
<p>「噲！老程！」李雲忽然想起了吳豹軍來。「聽說吳豹軍辦旅館虧了本，現在怎樣了」？「早逃走了」！</p>
<p>（三）今年吧！</p>
<p>大除夕又到了。</p>
<p>照例還是舊歷十二月三十夜，機關儘管不放假，老大房的猪油年糕還是給顧客搶了一空，街上也依舊到處浮動着熱鬧的空氣和過年的景象。</p>
<p>午後六點鐘，李雲接到程元大律師事務所裏的職員打來一個電話，說程律師請他去吃年夜飯，地點是法租界××路程律師的新居。　　放下了電話機上的聽筒，李雲就躊躇起來了，他知道法租界××路是距離他家很遠的，而且並没有直達的電車或公共汽車可通，尤其使他感覺到往返的不便，於是他决意不去了。　　程元雖然是眞正的闊起來了，對於老朋友，倒還肯敷衍敷衍，他居然也起到了李雲不能去的難處，竟打發他的車夫開了一輛簇新的别克轎車到李家去迎接李雲。同時又教車無帶了一個口信，說是：「吳豹軍也在座」。</p>
<p>李雲還是穿着西裝，戴着絲絨帽，但是當他踏進了程元的新居，他便立刻起了一重不安的感覺；頭上，耀着的是百金以上一具的新式電燈：脚下，襯着的是三四寸厚的織着細花紋的絨毯；最摩登的沙發，異樣的熱水汀，以及主人主婦的雍容華貴的衣飾，都像火一般的把他烘枯了！他覺得自已已不再是一頭鳳凰，而是一頭山雞了！</p>
<p>在一陣寒喧之後，主客都歸了座。下人送上了一杯咖啡來。</p>
<p>「方才馬蘭記的小開來，他說你還短他一筆賬，我因爲是六十幾元的小數目，所以已替你塡付了」。程元悄悄地向李雲耳語着。　　李雲自已也不明白何以臉上忽然覺得格外的燙了，右手伸在衣袋裏，半響摸不出什麼東西來。</p>
<p>「我…我…我過幾天奉還……」不待李雲說完，程元已把一顆頭不住的搖着，並利用一支雪茄，塞住了李雲的口，教他不要再說下去。意思是「不須再算」了。李雲當然是感激得幾乎向他作楫。</p>
<p>將要入席的時候，吳豹軍還是像八年前一樣的衣冠不整的趕來了。態度是異常的慌亂，李雲正想問他何以遲到，他的爽直的答復已自動的送過來了。</p>
<p>「你的日子眞是過得太舒服了！今天不是大除夕嗎！誰不給幾個錢逼得過不過去」！</p>
<p>現在，李雲是不敢再暗笑他了，祇發了一聲同情的長嘆。</p>
<p>其時，主人已把四五十位嘉賓齊讓進餐廳裏去了。</p>

<p>▲代表演說主席葉春年報吿開會宗旨後、商會代表嚴諤聲演說、略云、今日爲四童軍殉難二週紀念、我們應當哀悼、但是在另一方面講、我們應當爲四童軍祝賀、因爲人們在社會上、往往享受和貢獻不能相等、四童軍生前、在社會的地位、並不見高、年齡又輕、享受於社會者當然很菲薄、但是他門能够爲國家服務、能够犠牲自已、現在受着大家的紀念、那末他們的貢獻於社會者、可說是很厚了、所以我們應當爲他們祝賀云、云、紅十字會王培元代表李君演說云、二年前今</p>
<p>天早上、正是我在紅會指揮救護隊出發救濟戰區災民、我親自把證章遞交四烈士的手中、可是他們出去了之後、至今没有回來、我們應該紀念他們爲國犠牲、我們應該格外努力、末後四烈士家屬應竸答詞、直至八時三十分散會、</p>

<p>部令五大學停辦夜校後</p>
<h3>法政學生商應付辦法</h3>
<p>▲定二月四日在同義中學▲召開全體夜校同學大會</p>
<p>教育部前經派員視察本埠東吳·滬江·商學院·國立商學院·法政·持志等五大學辦理夜校、以其與學校教育之章程不合、且多流弊、故特通令各該校停止招收夜校新生、並將原有在校學生自定辦法分别結束、各情業誌昨報、茲悉法政學院夜校學生聞訊後、特召集全體大會籌商應付辦法、茲錄其通吿如下、溯自部令各校停辦夜班消息傳播後、羣情惶惑駭異萬分、茲爲明瞭部令眞意、並謀應付辦法起見、定於二月四日（星期日）下午一時假福煦路馬浪路口同義中學開本校乙組（卽夜班）同學全體大會、凡吾乙組同學務祈撥冗蒞會、共策進行、事關學業、幸勿自誤爲要、法律系四年級乙組級友會啓、</p>

<p>五縣同鄕會停辦</p>
<h3>創制中學發生糾紛</h3>
<p>▲同鄕會以經費支出决定停辦</p>
<p>▲學校方面認此舉爲蓄意破壞</p>
<p>（上海社云）本埠斜土路上海創制中學、爲通知崇海啓五縣同鄕會所設立、現有學生二百餘人、校務尙稱發達、近因同鄕會少數執委、藉口經費支絀、决定暫行停辦、致引起糾紛、學校亦陷於停頓狀態之中、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>▲糾紛原因五縣旅滬同鄕會設立之創制中學、開辦僅一學期、因內部意見紛岐、風潮迭起、經費支絀、超過限額三倍以上、負債頗巨、無法維持、故最近同鄕會决定暫行停辦、以待整理、而該校教職員及全體學生、以創制之設立、係根據同鄕會第九次全體大會决議、並由首次校董會推請湯景宗爲校長、半載以來、尙無隕越、乃同鄕會少數執委任意孤行、視法令如兒戲、視教育如草芥、殊爲痛心、茲爲愛護五縣失學子弟計、除將經過情形呈報巿教育局外、誓與倡言停辦學校者、奮鬥到底、因此雙方各走極端、糾紛未已、學校遂陷於停頓狀態之中、</p>
<p>▲校長表示據該校校長湯景宗語上海社記者謂、五縣同鄕在滬者、計有七十萬人之多、學齡兒童亦在十萬人以上、本校爲救濟同鄕失學兒童而設、並經全體會員大會通過、今以少數人之偏於私見、迫令停辦、殊與辦學宗旨、尤相背左、業將經過情形呈報教育局備案、至本人担任校長以來、心力交瘁、擬自動引退、以讓賢者云、</p>
<h3>巿民教館美藝展覽今日開幕</h3>

<h3>體育</h3>
<p>西青女籃球</p>
<p>白乃特女士送一份禮物使</p>
<p>兩江再得錦標</p>
<p>｜結果三十六比二十三｜</p>
<p>▲表演均佳形勢始終極緊張</p>
<p>▲白乃特雖缺席實力仍强勁</p>
<p>美婦因白乃特女士之因病缺席、遂使兩江再得西青女子籃球錦標、昨晚决賽、西青健身房中、觀者滿坑滿谷、倍覺熱鬧、美婦白乃特雖缺席、戰鬥依舊兇猛、兩江勝來、仍甚吃力、結果三十六比二十三、要非第四節美婦守衛荒亂、比數當不致相差如此之遠、</p>
<h3>形勢一暼</h3>
<p>論兩隊表演、動作敏捷、形勢非常緊張、自始至終、充滿濃厚興趣、兩江陳榮明楊森、慓悍兇猛、不若女流之輩、且聯絡美妙、投籃準確、後方守衛、當推陳白雪最佳、全隊球藝、實在美婦之上、美婦之敗、主將不到、全綫大有崩潰之勢、固爲最大原因、惟孟萊之善鬥、鮑後克之活潑、亦不可多得、華萊斯之防禦尙可、但行動無兩江迅速、技術稍差、失敗實爲必然之勢、</p>
<h3>美婦佔先</h3>
<p>美婦雄心勃勃、先發制人、處處予兩江以重大之威脅、鮑外克首開紀錄、兩江漸謀發展、前鋒聯絡、漸見合拍、陳榮明兩次遙射中的、旋雙方各加一分、兩江以五比三佔先、歡聲大作、美婦不稍氣餒、鮑沙克後路襲進、孟萊居中策應、連得五分、五比八、兩江反居下風、陳榮明再中遠球、成七比八、第一節乃終、</p>
<h3>兩江中興</h3>
<p>一度休息、兩江鋒芒忽盛、美婦後衛時有顧此失彼之弊、加以運球遲緩、時被兩江溜進漁利、於罰得一分之後、楊森還敬一分、陳榮明連來兩球、比數乃再超出、鮑沙克再中罰球後、又連失四分、於是兩江以十六比十導前、從此基礎穩固、無往不利矣、</p>
<h3>全盛時代</h3>
<p>然美婦氣焰不衰、反攻之勢、依然極盛、使兩江戒懼之心、不可稍懈、孟萊兩中、成十四比十六、旋成十六比十八、兩江奮起、加上三分、斯時兩隊聲勢均盛、氣焰非凡、各有建樹、局勢均衡、兩江以第二節之得利、故仍保持優越地位、第三節終、二十四比十八、兩江仍勝六分、</p>
<h3>一洩千里</h3>
<p>最後一節、美婦後衛鬆懈、加以不時調人、是以陣容喚散、不可收拾、兩江方興未艾、一中再中、曾成三十三比二十、大局奠定、錦標在把、最後結果、兩江以三十六比二十三勝、</p>

<h3>交大北征記（一）</h3>
<p>第一戰二比四敗於輔大</p>
<p>輔大個人技術勝於交大</p>
<p>交大後勁不足聯絡尙可</p>
<p>際茲臘尾、氣象蕭肅、體育界沉悶之際、交大隊恰好來平、足破岑寂之空氣、二十八日星期日、爲華北之王輔大與上海交大會師之期、定府街前車如水、輔仁塲內人如蟻、成空前之盛况、若廠甸之熙熙、時已二句鐘有半、兩軍試脚頭多時、王振聲出任球證、閑話表過、先賓後主、交大首開球、順風進取、極是得意、輔仁門前一陣擾亂、甫行平靜、再舉入寇、</p>
<p>▲鋒芒逼人萬象華的是非凡、邊陲傳中、直垂門前、王與民遭人監視、周光中頭頂成功、時距開塲、只三分鐘耳、輔仁禍不單行、伍幼安以手吻球、致遭責罰、周光中再度叩關、十二碼、勢在必進、霎時間、交大連勝二隻、四圍觀衆、咸爲輔仁揑把汗、</p>

<h3>中英通報</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>上海與倫敦間，直接通報，經國際電信局與國際電台人員之努力，籌備旣早就緒，試騐亦極通暢，已定月初正式開幕，開放通報。自此我國交通部所創之國際電台，（原來通歐美亞各地有十線，今復增加一線）與世界各大城巿，電信交通，均有直接之聯絡。往來電報，瞬息可達，不特便利僑商，且亦增進對外關係，殊爲本年我國交通史上値各紀念之一事。　　世界爲一大商塲。欲在此商塲中，竸爭角逐，改良國內土產，發展國外貿易，固屬急圖；然實際上苟無對外自主之通信機關，直達聯絡，則金融消息，以及巿價盈虧，不祇受操縱，亦慮緩不濟急；故各國於經商所及之地，輙以組織通信，樹之先聲，其故可深長思也。我國人士，歷感外力之侵略，深知提倡國貨，改良產物。同時推銷海外，以圖取得國際貿上地位，尤爲當務之急。交通部有見及此，於國際通信上，力圖擴展，輔助進行。成效旣覩，貿易自增，是此國際電台。所關係於國計民生者甚大也。　　更有言者，國際通信，不啻對外喉舌。從前受條約束縛，爲外商壟斷，今則自主經營通信範圍，遍及世界。可知無論何種事業，一經抱定决心，而繼之以奮鬥，雖遇艱阻，但結果卒能排除萬難，以底於成。國際無綫電台之經營，特其一例耳。際今中英通報聲中，因就感想所及，書之如此。</p>
<h3>國內洋文密電减價問題之研究雲城</h3>
<p>洋文密電向分甲乙兩種，甲種每字以十個字母爲限，乙種每字以五個字母爲限。此項密電，旣無意義，又難讀音，電局及電台職員傳遞之時，極感困難，而尤以甲種密電每字所含字母過多，無法記誦，縱將速率低，有時仍不免發生錯誤。是以各國電政機關，久有廢除甲種密電之議，卒於前年西班牙京城瑪德里舉行國際電政會議時，議决自今年一月一日起，廢止國際甲種密電。我國交通部因認此舉足以增進遞電之速率與凖確，於公衆及電局均屬有益，遂决定將國內甲種密電同時廢除，所有國際及國內洋文密電，一律每字至多以五個字母爲限。惟按照國際電報規則，密電係照明電價目十分之六收費，而現在國內洋文密電，交部規定仍照明電價目收費，因此頗有一部分商家認爲交通部對於國內及國際電報之待遇，似不公允，要求國內洋文密電亦照國際密電辦法，减成收費。我人觀乎交通部一年餘來電政方面之設施，頗覺其對於便利公衆通信减輕人民負担之政策，積極推行，深具誠意，何以此次對於國內洋文密電價目，不予低减，實一値得研究之問題也。</p>
<p>據我人調查統計，國內往來之洋文密電，每年不過八十萬字，佔各種電報總字數中之極小部分，卽使仿照國際電報辦法减費四成，每年損失之數，亦僅六七萬元，衡諸交部最近所抱政策，似不致有所吝惜，蓋交部自本年一月一日起，僅華文電報住址减費一事，每年卽須損失報費四十萬元，加急電减價一事，又須損失八九萬元，均能毅然實行，是其明證，故交部此次規定國內洋文密電仍照全價收費，其原因决非顧惜所費損失，而必别有重大之理由，可以斷言。然則其理由果何在乎？據交部發表，蓋有左列數種。　　（一）國內報價與國際報價標凖不同　　按國內電報價目之訂定，其標凖根本與國際電報價目不同，例如南京北平間之距離，約略與南京長崎間之距離相等，然由南京發往北平之洋文電報，每字僅需二角，而發往長崎者，每字需費一元二角五分，相差至六倍之巨，可見國內報價根本不能與國際價相提並論也。　　（二）國內洋文密電與華文密電價目之　　　比較現行國內電報價目，華文密電以四碼或五碼爲一字，收費二角，行之已久，尙稱公允。新章洋文密電係五個洋文字母爲一字，傳遞時所耗人工材料，實較華文密電爲多，而價目則與華文密電相等，本已略佔便宜。如果再仿國際電報辦法，减去四成，每字收費一角二分，則對於華文密電之發報人，末免太不公允。蓋在中國境內發寄洋文密電者，究以外商居多，而利用華文密碼者多爲本國行商，交部自未便厚於外人而薄於本國人民也。</p>
<p>（三）洋文密電與明電之比較</p>
<p>洋文密電一字，可代明電數字至數十字。任舉一例，譬如按照ABC　Telegraphic　Codc其中OPKAHL字，卽代表明語Goods　advised“To　be　deliveredfree　of　duty　and　allｃｈａｒｇｅｓ　ｃｏｌｌｅｃｔｄｕｔｙ　ｆｏｒｗａｒｄ　ｂｕｔ　ｄｅｂｉｔ、ｕｓ　ｗｉｔｂ　ｄｅｌｉｖｅｒｙ　ｃｈａｒｇｅｓ　ｔｏ　ｔｈｅ　ｎｅａｒｅｓｔ　ｒａｉｌｗａｙｓｔａｌｉｏｎ，Ｒｅｆｅｒｅｎｃｅ　Ｎｏ，（一）等二十七字，標點符號尙不在內。現在僅照明電一字價目收費，可謂低廉已極，若再按照明電價目减費十分之四，殊無以對一般發寄洋文明電之公衆，若謂密電每字祇有五個字母，而明電之字母可以多至十五個字母，殊不知洋文明電之字，每字僅一二個字母者頗多，按照各國專家之研究，洋文明電之每字平均長度，亦不過五六個字母而已。</p>
<p>（四）爲求國內報價之整齊起見</p>
<p>按交通部對於國內報價，力求簡單整齊，例如華文明碼不分本省隔省，每字一律收費一角，華文密碼或洋文照此加倍。似此辦法，電局及發報人計算報費均甚便利。如將洋文密電另訂减費辦法，勢必使國內報價又趨繁複，似非所宜。</p>
<p>總之，一年以來交部當局，對於電信交通力謀改進之精神以及重視公衆利益之誠意，已有充分事實爲之證明，並爲多數國人所公認。此次規定國內洋文密電收費辦法，於事前必有詳密之考慮，通盤之籌劃，而覺必須如是辦理方爲公允妥適，其動機决非爲吝惜每年六七萬元之報費，而置發報人之意旨於不顧。是以現行國內洋文密電收費辦法，雖有一部份行商表示不滿，迨經交部一加解釋，亦遂完全諒解也。</p>
<h3>移動業務無綫電話槪說</h3>
<p>— 陳賢鼎</p>
<p>無線電話實際上祇可用等幅電波，而不能用减幅電波，惟若用多次（每分鐘一○，○○○次）振盪之减幅電波，亦屬可能。自派克發射機發明後，歐美各國曾在船舶電台上作是項無線電話之試騐。結果甚屬良好。最初係將傳話機，或平行裝設之多數傳話機，直接裝於天線電路。而天線電路則用感導方法，與一閉振電路內所之裝派克發電機相配合。嗣在歐戰時因眞空管之發明，無線電話乃有長足之進展。是項眞空管發射機，近日用於船舶電臺作爲無線電話之用者，其負載電波之電力，不過自五瓦特以至五百瓦特而已。</p>
<p>一九二○年至一九二九年，各國均用中間電波作是項試騐。結果單工電路，甚屬滿意。若雙工電路，即發射機與收受機同時工作時，則甚感困難。因爲第一圖</p>
<p>初對於發射機及收受機之互擾，未能設法避免。良以普通無線電收發，發射天線及收受天線之位置，必須相距甚遠，俾使互擾作用娳以極力减免。若在船上，則地位有限，安能任意措置？惟多動　無線電話應注意之點有二：其一即岸上有線電話用户必須以海岸電臺爲媒介，第二圖</p>
<p>終止器SB擴大器（1）擴大器（2）</p>
<p>擴大器（1）RTRR回音消滅器擴大器（2）感受器發射器始得與船舶電臺豐連接。其二即船上祇須有一個話機，即足以應付乘客之同時傳話或聽話。就此兩點以作技術上之改進，船上裝置乃大爲簡便。收受部份之電氣裝置與發射部份之電氣裝置，完全互相隔離。陸地裝置，則自終止器termnator發明後，媒介問題即行解决。陸上收受機所收之符號或干擾，不至再由發射機傳出而擾亂船上收聽。其裝置情形如第一圖所示。</p>
<p>是　方式尙須於陸地上裝一回音消滅器ｃｈｏcxtinguishero因無線電話，路程遙遠，傳遞時間較長。陸地裝置，對於平衡凖確度Ｐｒｅｃｉｏｎ　ｏｆ　ｂｎｌａｎｃｉｎｇ不免時有變動。談話之一小部份，常傳回船上，因回音關係，時有互擾之虞。回音消滅器，足以免除是項阻碍。是項機件，係用聲音指揮。在一方通話時，則他方傳來之聲音完全消滅，而回音電流絕　通過。</p>
<p>第二圖所示，係回音消滅器之簡單裝置。此器與栅極轉變器相連接，當通話電流自船舶發射而至終止器，即由收音擴大器ｒｏｃｏｉｖｏｒ　ａｍｐｌｉｇｏｒｒ爲之擴大</p>
<p>。該電流之一部份，則受回音消滅器Ｒ│Ｔ之整理（蓋回音消滅器之功用與整流器相等。）其時，直流負電壓在栅極起重大作用，對於發音擴大器ｔｒａｎｓｍｉｔｔｅｒamplihorI能制止通話電流由終止器回射船上。其他一個回音消滅器T·R，則在岸上用户發話時同樣接在收音擴大器（1）上。此個圖音消滅器，功能消除船舶電臺由收受機傳來之海面上及自本身電臺所發生的一切干擾。旣不至感動回音消滅器Ｒ·Ｔ及侵犯發音擴大器，亦不至經由終止器將是項干擾傳回對方陸地電臺。而陸地用户發話時，對於上述各項干擾，亦得依同樣方式消除之。　　船上發射及收受裝置，應電氣上完全隔離，不至因反應配合而發生感動，使收音器發生吱吱之聲。但發射天線及收受天線，因船舶地位狹小，必須相距甚近，其間感導作用，仍難完全避免。而電話本身有接綫四條，自已成一無線電路，其自身感導亦難消除。加以衰减作用ｆａｄｉｎｇ　effect，在短波尤爲顯著。坐是種種，無線電話之穩定，乃不能與四綫回路之長途電話相比較。</p>
<p>欲除去此等困難，必須採用消滅調整器及反應消滅器。消滅調整器，其原理如下：所收聲音愈低，則收音擴大愈高，成相反言之。其方法係利用在收音機出　所產生之電流，使其與高　擴大器之栅極相接如此，收長電爲　　　，則栅極爲得衰阻　　　　　　　　　　動加以調整。實際，是項調整速度極高，不易令人感覺。</p>
<p>普通旣用消滅調整器，即可滿意通話。但最好再在陸上裝一反應消滅器，以求完美。一則以防止身身感導，一則以備消滅作用太在時，即調整器失其效用時之補救。反應消滅器之主動力，亦係聲音與回音消滅器相同。在一方傳話時，功能阻止他方之混擾，無論在通話或靜止時，雙方均不至發生自身器導。</p>
<h3>「麥」與「鹼」</h3>
<p>— 觀</p>
<p>近閱海上某報記載，大意謂某省建設廳奉到實業部令，調查所屬各地產麥數量，及運銷情形，於是由廳分電各縣辦理。不料電文中「麥」七七九六，誤譯爲「鹼」七七六九，因此各縣回電，多說「本縣並未產鹼」，覆查之下，電局確無錯悮，錯悮者爲建設廳之譯電員：因爲譯電員不熟電碼，無意中將交中重要的麥字，譯成鹼字，雖祇有末尾兩個阿拉伯字顚倒，但失諸毫釐，竟差以千里矣。</p>
<p>我國電報，用四個阿拉伯字，代替一字。要熟譯者，不須逐字翻覓，輒能隨筆譯成，一無舛誤。若係生手，往往每字對碼，不特費時，且易遺漏錯誤。現聞交通部方面，正在研究國音電報，預備實行，此舉似能補救上述之缺點。在未實行之前，苟欲發報，而自問譯電非熟練者，正不妨交由電報局台代譯所費極微，且亦負正確之責也。</p>
<h3>電報實行减價矣？</h3>
<p>— 萃夫</p>
<p>部令自本年一月一日起，急電减作二倍收費，華文電報之收報人姓名住址，不逾十五字者，作五字計，可得十字之减費，質言之，電報减價，今已實行矣。</p>
<p>自來討論電報價目問題者，有二說焉：其第一說曰：電報宜减價；其第二說曰：電報宜加價。每一說之理由曰：（Ａ）電報爲國這經營之事業，其目的在溝通文化，報務民衆，猶國家之辦學校然，絕不以半利爲目的，卽有虧負，亦當由政府截長補短。（Ｂ）在民衆一般心目中，覺得電報價目太貴，除商家外，民間苟非遇疾病死亡大事，絕不輕發電報，可爲明證。（Ｃ）現在世界經濟恐慌，國民經濟衰落，都巿百業，常藉减價以招徠，故爲適應此急迫之環境計，實有减價之必要云云。第二說之理由曰：（Ａ）電政虧負已屬不貲，修綫購料均無的欵，若萬一减價，深恐報數不增，而報費銳减，必致虧負更鉅，不可收拾。（Ｂ）倘價目十分减低，使發電如寄航郵快信，則報務驟增，綫路上必致擁擠不堪，人手上必感調派不敷，此爲一困難之問題。（Ｃ）郵政與電報同是國營事業，年前郵費曾加價一次，未聞有若何不良之反應，則電報加價何妨？二說紛紜，相持莫决者，蓋已非一日矣！</p>
<p>今者霹靂一聲，吾政府毅然從减價之說以行矣，此種勇氣，爲年來主持電政者所僅見，亦見其欲便利民衆，促進業務之心甚殷，此吾民衆所應深切認識者也。　　再者此次减費辦法有一特點在，卽關於收報人姓名住址一節是也。緣從來發報人，每求字數之减少，不計及電報之是否便於投遞。於是收報人遂往往有姓而無名，有里而無路，有街而無鎭，舉其缺點，不一而足。而其不能妥投之結果，豈惟電局徒費公電來復之煩，抑電報本身亦失其時間上之效能，此其損失爲何？如今則辦法更新，發報人得在十五字範圍以內，儘量詳細叙明，一洗從前投送不到之顧慮，不亦快哉！此吾民衆所並應明瞭者也。</p>
<p>或曰：「按此次减費章程所規定者，除洋文電報另論外，如我儕常用二字店號爲收報人者，例如「杭州大成……」，平時作四字計，向亦可以投到，今照新章，反須作五字計，是有减費之名，而兼增費之實，何也」答曰：電報住址，除掛號者外照章務須詳明，俾電局或電台無須查詢探訪，卽可投送。如上述以「杭州大成」四字作爲住址之例，實屬過於簡略，不合定章，以前各局台對於此項電報，均予照收，乃係通融辦理，但流弊滋多，萬一杭州有名爲「大成」之商號兩家或該「大成」爲一不知名之商號，電報卽有誤投或無法投遞之虞。若謂此種住址，必爲當地有名之商號，往來電報甚多，不虞局台無法投送，殊不知旣爲往來電報甚多之有名商號，其住址必已在當地局台掛號，發報人反不利用其掛號字樣代替住址，所省報費可更多也。</p>
<p>或又曰：此次雖曰减費，而其所减之程度，尙未能饜吾人之望。則答曰：政府此次减費辦法，倘得社會民衆之贊護，羣起儘量利用電報，使此計劃行有成效，則繼續减價，自在意料中耳！</p>
<p>是月也，直達成，英報通手中。中英</p>
<h3>中英通報之面面觀</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>交通部爲發展國際通信起見，於前年與英國馬可尼分司訂立購買無線電機合同，同時與英帝國交通公司簽訂中英報務合同，年餘以來，關於通報情事，進行不遺餘力：如借用庚欵，以付機費也；收買地畝，以奠台址也；派員出洋實習，以資深造也；種種消息，時見報端，久爲國人所注意。今則電台已落成矣！實習員已回國矣！電機已裝設矣！試騐通報已成功矣！且定於二月三日正式開放直達通報矣。歷時一年有餘，費用達百萬元，不可謂非交通部兩年來最大之建設也。中英通報之意義，實重且大！茲就各方面關係，試略述之：　　（一）自中英締結南京條約，我國五口通商，洞開門户，嗣後法，德，美，日，意等國，接踵而來，援例與我訂立通商條約，遂由閉關自守之國，變爲國際勢力角逐之塲。我之一舉一動，無不影響國際政治；而國際間之一言一語，又無不與我國內政治有關，如環之無端，如響之斯應。查列强之中，與我通商最早者，旣爲英國；與我關係最密者，亦莫如英國。試觀倫敦巿中國公債價格之消長，爲各大都巿對華貿易之標凖，而「巴力門」討論中國問題，爲世界政治家所注目。中英關係無論在政治上經濟上，都比歐洲任何一國爲大。今歐亞兩大國家直接通報，對晤一堂，推誠相見，此在中英兩國交誼上甚至世界政治經濟上言之，饒有莫大意義者也。</p>
<p>（二）我國受不平等條約之束縛，已歷八十年，電信事業，亦受外商水線公司合同上之限制，全失國際通信之自由。近年交通部國際電台成立，先後與香港，澳門，馬尼刺，西貢，爪哇舊，金山，柏林，巴黎，日內瓦，莫斯科等通信，國際報務，日見發達。時値水線合同，均已滿期，外商始帖然就範，與我簽訂新約，上海愛多亞路之水線公司，遂爲國際電信局之附屬機關。但佔國際報務百分之六十之中英電報，若無直接電路以接通之，未免美中不足。今則中英通報吿成，不啻將八十年來通信上之桎梏，完全打破，此在國家主權上言之，可大書特書者也。</p>
<p>（三）按馬德里國際電信公約附屬之電報規則第二章第二條：「凡電局間互相往來之電報相繼不絕，或極爲繁忙者、應於可能範圍內，用直達通信電路以接通之，其電路之數目，務使足可適用業務上之需要」云云。夫中英報務之繁，旣如上述，遠非各國可比，向者由大東或大北水線公司電路接轉，歷時須二十分鐘，近來由上海巴黎間或上海柏林間無線電路遞轉，歷時須十五分鐘，今則中英直接通報，歷時僅須二分鐘，（參看本刋第四期國際電台一暼）此在中英通信史上打破新紀錄也。</p>
<p>總上三端，實爲中英通報之重大意義。吾人一方面慶祝中英兩國友誼之益</p>
<p>增親善，以促進世界和平；又一方面慶祝我國電信主權之次第收回，以奮與民族意志。至於陸地長距離通信之成功，國際電報營業之發達，又深佩交通當局之遠見與電台同人之努力也。</p>
<h3>半月消息</h3>
<p>中公電特准免費</p>

<h3>蘇省江北報務之改善</h3>
<p>蘇省江北各處往來電報，爲數頗多，惟因電報線路關係，每一電報，須經數次轉遞，以致傳遞未臻迅速。近聞交部爲使江北報務之迅捷起見，將在上海清江浦間，設法騰出一線，直接通報。嗣後江北各片上海及蘇杭一帶往來電報。祇須經清江浦及上海兩局接轉，當可異常迅速。卽與平津漢等處往來電報，亦由滬局接轉，較前必可迅速一倍云。</p>

<p>交部最近一年來，對於電報力求商業化與民衆化，故新訂各項减費章程，極爲民衆所欲知悉。茲聞交部爲便利民衆查閣起見，特將各項减費章程，摘要編印單行本五萬份，以備分發各界查閱。此項單行本，並附載本刋第一二三期所登之「查問電報須知」，故備此一册，甚爲有用。又新章對於洋文電報計算字數辦法，較舊章變更甚多，故交部同時又編印「洋文電報字數計算法」單行本一種，並附刋英文說明，以便外人索閱云。以上兩種單行本，不久卽可印竣，均可問當地電局或電台免費索取，如向本社函索亦可。</p>
<h3>各國無線電話發展的近况（上）</h3>
<p>— 王大椿譯</p>
<p>近一二年來，各國電信事業的發展，當以無綫電話爲最高紀錄。最新開通的各無綫電話，其重要的，有（一）南美阿根廷，智利，烏拉圭，三國，直通澳洲的無綫電話回路，這回路是擴展澳洲的國際通信，使全澳洲各埠，及紐西蘭島各地，開放國際通話，以達於全世界。（二）智利直通西班牙，再自西班牙，利用原有通至大西洋中開那歷羣島（ＣａｎａｒｙＬｓｌａｎｄｓ），及瑪洛加島（Ｍａｌｌｏｒｃａ（Ｌｓｌａｎｄ）的無綫電話，使南北美各地，和歐洲北斐，均因原有陸綫及無綫電報的接連，彼此相通。（三）南美哥倫比亞國的無綫電話，亦經通達阿根廷，智利，烏拉圭，三國，以及阿根廷國際無線電公司在歐洲的各無線電話站。（四）島際無綫電話（ｎｔｅｒ、ｉｓＬａｎｄ　Ｓｅｒｖｉｃｅ），自美國直達夏威夷及盤瑪達羣島（Ｂｕｒｍｕｄａ　llands）的，亦於最近吿成。</p>
<p>連續發射的無綫電話，稱謂Tandem　Ｃｉｒｃｕｉｔｓ的，近在北美洲和爪哇間，開放通話，中間經過兩處中繼站，一在荷蘭阿姆斯坦特，一在德京柏林。自爪</p>
<p>哇至澳洲，至蘇門得拉，至暹羅三處的連絡無綫電話回路，卽在此開放。　　有許多國家的陸綫電信，每利用無綫電話，去開放國際通話，例如（一）英帝國電話網，現接通印度支那，摩洛哥，及紐西蘭各地。（二）南北美洲，接通羅馬尼亞及愛沙尼亞。（三）瑞典接通印度支那，暹羅，爪哇及澳洲。（四）芬蘭通爪哇。（五）比國通暹羅。（六）德國通印度支那。（七）拉脱維亞通暹羅及爪哇。（八）捷克及盧森堡通暹羅及印度支那。（九）荷蘭及匈牙利通印度支那。（十）奧國通暹羅及印度支那。（十）（一）瑞士通摩洛哥，印度支那及暹羅。這都是利用無綫電話的。意大利及沙突尼亞間的無綫電話，亦經開通。南美洲巴西國電話公司的電話網，亦利用無綫電話，和美國，加拿大，墨西哥，古巴，阿根廷，智利，烏拉圭各國的電話網相通。現更進行接通歐洲各國，大約在最短期內，可以開幕。至於美國和日本間的無綫電話站，亦經建築成立。英國和印度，斐洲及埃及等處，亦有裝置無綫電話的計劃。</p>

<h3>日貨大舉傾銷下之我國工廠</h3>
<p>— 仰莾</p>
<p>近來我國國貨，因受外貨的大量傾銷，銷路日見阻滯，辦工廠的感受最大的困難，無過於銷路問題。最近全國朝野，雖一再努力於提倡國貨運動，然外貨對我的傾銷，仍一天激增一天，尤其是日貨的傾銷，用着有計畫有組織的方法，由日本政府統制之下，大舉侵略。除以大量貨品來華傾銷以外，近且改取在華開辦工業政策，超越關科壁壘，利用我國低廉工資和豐富原料，大量的製造我國人所需之各竹工業品，實行傾銷。其出品均冒充國貨，雖專門家也難判辨，目光最注意之點，尤爲我工業薈萃之上海。最近據實業當局之調查，如電燈泡工廠，琺瑯工廠，鐵工廠，熱水瓶工廠，紡織機器製造廠，製帽廠，橡膠廠，金屬精鋉廠，染色廠，電氣機械廠，製傘廠，發動機製造廠，洋燈廠，電綫廠，洋鐵廠，製革廠，陶磁器廠，製藥廠，製罐廠等，均在增設之中，自添辦一廠以至五六廠不等。由滬而華北華南，以及長江流域，其製品銷路，不但以我國爲對象，南洋印度及近東各地，亦爲其製品之出路。我們在這日貨傾銷下之工廠，徒然恐懼固然是無益的，求助於政府，也是没有用的，求人莫如求已，目下惟一自救之道，只有下面四種辦法：</p>
<p>（一）各工廠趕快變換向來同業傾軋同行嫉妒的政策，聯合起來，一致在出品　　的品質上求改進，成本上求减輕，推銷上求門路，如果再是自相厮殺下　　去結果，便宜了敵人，徒爲他們所笑。</p>
<p>（二）各工廠需用機器，如果有本國貨可用，千萬再不要買外貨，買仇貨，以趨於自殺的一途，尤其是紡織業中，千萬要注意這點。</p>
<p>（三）各工廠趕快注意專門人選，物色技術人才，務使事事得人，人人稱職，以成美備有秩序之工廠，纔能立足於現時代之工業界。</p>
<p>（四）各工廠趕快抱着眞實穩健的態度，和銀行界切實携手，以得到實力上的援助。</p>

<h3>願婦女們喚起國魂！</h3>
<p>— 南國佳人</p>
<p>眼兒媚，</p>
<p>眉樣新；</p>
<p>雪膚伴玉貌，</p>
<p>麗服炫摩登；</p>
<p>怎奈是倩女離魂！</p>
<p>我們的靈魂兒走失了！　　怎麼說呢？　　你從社會的任何方面去看，有幾件事物是憑著我們自已的心思才力創作的？有幾件事物不是受著外力的牽制，簸弄？　　最大最現前的事情，譬如說，「國際技術合作」，我們的生產建設事業，非借外資不能舉辦；非用外國技術人員不能著手；非購外國機械工具不能發動，這個不消說得「楚材晋用」，只要不是「借刀殺人」，而是用之於生產建設事業，世界任何新興國家，都少不得採用這個策略。何况我們的先總理早有這個啓示。　　再說小的事情，布爾喬亞的巿民，不管是男的女的，是商界，工界，政界，愈是年青俊秀，他們或她們的服食器用，愈是「摩登化」，「奢侈化」，換句話說：愈是「洋化」　　國產的貨品儘多著，可是在每個「時代可人兒」的潛在意識裏，似乎總包含著「外國貨是優美的，精緻的，合於衛生的，便於使用的……中國貨是粗糙的，拙劣的不潔净的，不耐用的……」。於是居然有很多投機工廠投機商人，把明明是國產的貨品，預備售給本國人用的，却冐用著外國文的商標式樣，藉圖便於高價出售。你道這種心理變態的社會現實情况，不是魂靈兒已經走失了一大半麼？　　說到我們的女界，女子的愛美心理，勝於男子；女子喜歡妝飾的對象，自然是「爲悦已者容」；恰和青春時期的男子欲得少艾的鍾情而盡量的逞能獻媚一樣。　　你試去分析一般摩登婦女，！現代化的標準女性！的心理，差不多總會著這樣一個見解：　　「國貨，我所欲也，摩登，亦我所欲也，二者不可得兼：舍國貨而取摩登者也。」　　爲了摩登，於是髮必捲，唇必朱，鞋必高跟，服必西式，雪膚花貌之化裝品必舶來；佳人固飄飄其欲仙，而一身一家一國的靈魂兒也就隨之凌虛御風，呌喚不回來了！　　這幾時，我住在上海北四川路，除了每天晨鷄報曉的時候，可以聽到大日本駐滬總兵營裏出來的軍號聲，早巡的步伐聲，看到一陣陣嚴裝的日軍，一隊隊衝來衝去如臨戰陣的鐵甲車之外，我在電車中，馬路上可以盡量鑒賞那來來去去的「櫻花仕女」，說也奇怪！她們無論老的少的，差不多都是高髮子，大袖子，套著面罩，拖著木屐，自頂至踵，幾乎全副式樣，全套質料，没有一件不是她們本國貨品。我想這一小點，也就足以表顯她們的「大和魂」！</p>
<p>我們「中華的魂」呢？我願我們的婦女界來喚醒則個！</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3>籌設各地國貨公司之我見</h3>
<p>— 炳賢</p>
<p>國貨的運動，洋貨的傾銷，仇貨的掙扎，釀成了近兩年來商業上含有國際鬥爭意義的多角竸爭的局勢。事實展開着，過去一年中，一般國貨運動者熱誠提倡的結果，總算有了相當的收獲，但這狀態是畸形的，國貨，在都巿間雖因了一般人的提倡，得以在這鬥爭中佔着優越的趨勢，但在內地，仍受了各方面的阻礙，雖以發展。現在各大國貨工廠爲要剷除這畸形的狀態起見，特聯合一般熱心國貨運動者，有在全國組設二十四處國貨公司的企圖，并特約銀行，調劑金融，藉羣策羣力，以規復國內已失去了的巿塲。這是無疑的，已延長了戰綫，擴大了實力，向已深入內地巿塲的洋貨進攻了。　　查洋貨的在內地，和都巿裏差不多，幾乎每家都有牠們的蹤跡，尤其是仇貨。而牠們的所以如此猖獗，雖有其他的種種原因，但內地的缺少直接販賣國貨的機關，實是個主因。現在各地的國貨公司一旦成立，那與原有的洋貨商的衝突，嚴重的利害衝突，一定是無可避免，　同時，仇貨洋貨的最後掙扎亦在意料中。這鬥爭的結果，雖不能逆料，但有一點，這是組織國貨公司者所不得不深思熟慮的，就是嚴防外貨業的最後孤注，傾全力於鄕村推銷。　　夫各地國貨公司的籌設，原以規復內地巿塲爲主旨。但其計劃上所要設立的，是仍在內地的都邑。要知，內地的一般消費者的大本營，乃不在巿廛而多在鄕村。在籌設國貨公司者的立塲，自以擇繁盛之區營業爲宜，但這給一般業洋貨者以有隙可乘了。他們就握住這一黠，利用一般鄕村擔賣者，依舊把洋貨源源輸入鄕村。這樣一來，都巿間的國貨愈發展，鄕村裏的洋貨愈猖獗，主旨是要剷除這畸形狀態，結果這狀態發展得更畸形。所以在設立公司的時候，一定要兼顧到這一層，在公司門巿營業之外，更兼營鄕村販賣的業務，那或者才能達到眞正的收回國內巿塲吧！</p>
<p>國貨介紹</p>
<h3>婦女國貨年與化妝品</h3>
<p>— 雪友</p>
<p>在宿舍裏，我們七八個人一個房間，每到晚九時後，便是我們談話的時候到了。談話的中心，往往集中到化妝品，那一種牌子的好瓖（自然全是國貨），經過了大家的同意，大家就一致的採用。　　同胞們，我願貢獻給你們知道，大家一致採用，不要把金錢送給外國，使他國强盛，而使國內之工業日漸凋落。</p>
<p>（一）面粉｜那一種牌號的最好，不傷皮膚，這是一個很重大的問題，如果選擇不得法，那還是以不擦爲妙。有許多人喜擦法國西蒙香粉，中國無敵牌的蝶粉可以代之。它如現在風行一時的，爲好萊塢明星們一致推崇的MaxFotepouder中國亦有王漢倫美容院所製造的粉，可以代替之。我以爲此二種爲最佳　　　（二）雪花膏｜喜擦三花牌的，可以中國蝶霜代之。太平洋藥房的統治霜可以代面友（面友現在的銷數已很驚人），女兒霜孩兒面，皇后霜及廣生行的雪花膏全良好，可以作最好的粉底子。</p>
<p>（三）胭脂｜國貨中的胭脂，其最大缺點，在於紅色不長久。經達半黠鐘或在太陽下晒晒，就立刻退色，希望國貨的提倡家注意這點，改造一番，實是我們所盼望的。常在街上，看到許多摩登女郎，兩頰緋黄，朋友們！這就是你們選擇色彩的錯誤了，我們知道兩頰當紅如蘋果，决不能使兩頰黄如橘皮啊！</p>
<p>（四）唇膏你們不要以爲舶來品好，我請你到國貨公司去購買一條國貨唇膏，價値僅只舶來品的一半，而且使用後包你滿意的。　　（五）牙膏｜三星，潔白，月裏嫦娥，白玉，留蘭香，各種牙膏全很好。</p>
<p>（六）臨睡時所擦的冷膏，（卽ＣｏｌｄＣｒｅａｍ）可以採用三星的「芳澤脂」。它可以使你毛孔清潔，細嫩皮膚。　　（七）畫眉筆｜國貨的畫眉筆太柔軟，用上去和假的一般，用畫眉刷則只能加重黑色，不能使眉加長。有了這個缺點，我們雖然不能買國貨來用，但亦不願買舶來品。在這國貨畫眉筆未改造之前，我們只有用柳樹枝，剝皮後用火燒，再沾水來畫眉。</p>
<p>總之，我們身爲女子的，每人這樣做去只計算每人一盒粉，中國的婦女共有多少？就可知購買國貨的影響够怎樣的大？　　今年是「婦女國貨年」，希望女同胞先由採用國產化妝品做起，再及於其他。因愛美爲婦女的天性啊！</p>
<h3>貪嘴奸商</h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>祖國弄到現在上下交困，大家鬧窮！這是帝國主義經濟侵略之所賜！也就是貴中國國民，愛買洋貨，愛慕虛榮！貪嘴勿留窮性命！</p>
<p>前天新聞報本埠附刋上，發表某君的報吿：說是日商喬裝華服，假杏花樓宴請大批棉布奸商，席設百餘席之多，奸商欣然赴會，意氣洋洋，我眞不懂奸商的親敵不怕血腥氣！貪嘴勿留窮性命！關外之河山未復，關內之操刀自割！凉血至此，還有何說？我敢大聲疾呼於男女同胞之前，無論是國貨年也罷，非國貨年也罷，在我們天賦的責任上，怏怏注意這班大批奸商的行動，大衆去制裁他，而在自已的本位呢一致厲用國貨！大家起來吧！</p>

<h3>宦官文明</h3>
<p>— 古明</p>
<p>自從德國近來實施消滅生殖機能的刑法後，敝國人士都不平起來，彷彿覺得「大勢已去」，要竭力挽回，這就影響到自己身上似的。本來充滿了種種性病的民族，對於這類事非常敏感，其故可知。只看報紙上花柳藥廣吿之多，和性慾小說的流行，便可知其一二。</p>
<p>偏偏近來有許多人對於西洋這類事非常肯下研究功夫。提起許多文學作家如波特萊兒，王爾德之流，他們並不知道渠們有文學作品，而祇知道渠們的變態性病。中國是不肯加這種研究功夫的，一大半由日本紹介過來。本來吃海產品的民族，性感覺比較強，是有生理根據的。中國內地許多習慣，還存淳樸之風，如一個渾沌的鄕下姑娘。而她第一次走到大都巿中來，每一個毁壤她的是日本。　　但至今彷彿無人肯研究這類問題：如古代的宮刑是些什麼方法？是否根據優生？起於何時？幾千年文明古國容許着宦官這會事，便甚可怪。而且，這文明便可呌作「宦官文明」。　　這四字可以代表黄老，釋教，及儒家許多思想。其理想便是無馨無臭，彼此不相影響，要没人愛他或恨他。介乎兩性之間，却駕乎一切以上。使人毫不提防，陰影似的在黑暗中奔馳，消失。和尙們不必論，黄老都講無爲，便是先將一已的情感，本能，生命力化爲烏有，然後能在人叢中搗鬼，發生凡人所不能有的行爲。倘若是爲逃避人間苦而生這種人生觀，則不但距「宦官」，便是「死屍」也不遠了吧。　　用這尺度來估量古國文明，可以知道這文明何以没有發展及其祇見衰落下去的道理。</p>
<h3>兒子的死</h3>
<p>— 樊仲云</p>
<p>瀕死的兒子，在小床上喘着最後的氣，妻在床邊頓手頓足的嚎陶大哭，見了這悽慘的光景，心中一陣酸楚，眼涙不知不覺的連續而下了，雖然同時在腦海中，閃着「死了算什麼，値得那樣悲傷」的思想，然而一種愛戀的感情，｜就是親與子的感情罷｜支配着我，不管向來對於死人抱着厭忌的心理，却不由的也伏在他身上了。　　兒子的生命，只有十五個月又二日的歲月，在我的生活史上不過很短的一段，然而他給我的印象是太深刻了。因爲生活關係，除了上午在睡夢中過去外，下午很少在家，晚間又是我的文筆勞動的時間，没有與兒子相親的餘睱、但是他的對我，甚至比對他母親還要親嫟。因爲母親尙有責駡他的時候，而我則只有一如他的意思。當傍晚歸家的時候，看見他在門口招手，往往我還没有下車，他已撲在我的懷中了。於是我一路吻着他，抱到樓上，他一手扶着我的頸項，一手在吚呀吚呀的作語勢。一天的疲勞，就這樣消失在親子的和愛中。</p>
<p>從醫院回到家中種種的印象都一時浮上心頭，好像許多細小的針，刺着在我的心上。房間也特别的大了，床也特别的寬了，移去了玩上具，小床，小車，照片等等可資紀念的事物，希望能够抺去腦海中的印象，然而一種凄凉寂寥的氣象，依舊充塞在家中四隅，遍布於我心目之中。今日的夜，是何等的冷落啊！他象徵着我們家中的一綫生機，現在是爲運命所斵喪了，只有凄清悲哀，布滿着我們的周遭。</p>
<p>記着兒子湯餅宴的時候，自由談正改由烈文兄編輯，宏徒兄因爲我獨力支撑一個周刋，歷時三年，在一篇祝賀自由談的文字中，因稱他爲「未來的戰士」，宏徒兄贈給他的衣料包紙上，也這樣的寫着，然而當一九三四年的開始，這個三年有餘的周刋，爲環境所迫而停刋，而這位「未來的戰士」也在一月二十九日十時半，夭折於紅十字會醫院了！</p>
<p>在這社會，在這時代，我們是不當有理想，有努力的啊！</p>
<h3>紀念碑</h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>一月二十八，値得紀念的日子啊！　　睡醒的時候，四周悄悄地，一點聲息都没有。躺在床上瞧不見天，心里想着外面的天氣應該是陰暗的，愁慘的……　　可是推開窗子，鮮明的太陽光溜進來，帶着微微的暖意。没有風，一陣轟矗的電車聲衝破了清晨的寂寞。站在窗子前深深地呼了兩口氣；覺得輕鬆了點。可是拿起報紙；黑的綫，黑的哀詞又開始在眼前嗚咽着；就像重又回到兩年前的今天似地，這一帶全給帝國主義者的威燄壓迫着，百千的居民扶老携幼愴惶地逃避。飛機，大砲，機關槍終於在夜里出動了，對準中國人屠殺起來了！</p>
<p>日子飛快的過去，兩年以後的今日，吹過血腥的風的北四川路那麼平靜；着不見一點動亂。　　踏着稀微的陽光，獨自走出大門，擠到人叢中直向下走去。我有一顆沉重的心，我有一滴流不下來眼涙。我痛憤着祖國的糜爛，自已的沉迷；一面却自棄地覺得人生除了盡力追求一些快樂之外還有什麼呢？矛盾的心呵，愈來愈覺沉重了！</p>
<p>洋貨舖子里播音機送出曲子桃花江，路上的行人在這靡靡之音里微笑着。我抬起腦袋，我想在睛明的陽光下找到一兩支哀悼的半旗；然一直走到虬江路口還没有找到。</p>
<p>於是失望地低下眼珠子，柏油馬路上只有泥沙和橘子皮，可紀念的血痕早已不知那兒去了。便低低地太息了一聲，一輛日本海軍軍用汽車在我的身邊擦了過去。……　中午，我站在一堆廢墟前面，對着殘破的瓦碟，頹敗的牆頭，我想哭一塲；讓流不下來的眼涙在這悲痛的日子里流下來！我想在這廢墟上豎起一座紀念碑，用着肉手在碑上刻下我的紀念詞！　　可是爲什麼眼涙儘留在腦里呵！我拾起一塊斷磚顫抖着，紀念碑又在那一天才能够豎起來呢？</p>
<h3>讀「文學季刊」創刊號</h3>
<p>— 仲方</p>
<p>讀完一本雜誌，自然有點感想。然而據說想想尙可，倘使要把所想的用什麼書評的形式發表出來，那就不好；一則是當今之世，據說作者之羣很討厭什麼批評家，二則是略不小心就會拖累了作</p>
<p>者。</p>
<p>譬如「文學季刋」的創刋號中，登了九篇小說，依我的讀後感，首先就要推舉吳組湘的「一千八百担，」並且摹仿金聖嘆的筆法道　：「揭發封建社會的黑幕，讀之當浮」「大白」可是在這一九三四年的混沌世界，眞不知道「反封建」這個草標兒會不會拖累作者，所以還是取消了聖暵式的評語，來講講别的話罷。</p>
<p>吳組湘，大槪是一位不懂世故的青年人。你看他一枝筆很能寫，而且寫得很好，可是他定要寫一個土豪劣紳鷄鳴狗盜無所不有的什麼宋氏大家族，而且還要寫那個宋氏大宗祠在七月十五日開祠堂那半天工夫里的許多不堪相，這就太呌人掃興了！開祠堂之類，盛事也，相應善頌善禱；可惜吳組湘也者，就没有考慮到。然而我知道作者吳一定將譁然自辯曰：「這是我親眼看見的！」這就更荒唐了！中國之大，何奇不有；一方雖有宋氏大家祠那樣不愉快的事兒，另一方也何嘗没有赫赫靈靈哄動全球（恕我誇張一加）的模範祠堂？聰明的作者决不肯把家醜外揚。而內揚尤覺可惡！　　再有位余一，寫了篇「將軍。」單看題目，總以爲這一篇不是描寫抗日將軍，或者就是描寫內戰將軍了。那知大大不然。這原來寫的是流落在哈爾濱的冒牌</p>
<p>將軍的白俄而已。作者一枝筆也是很好的，把這位自封將軍的流落者寫得可笑也復可憐，甚至寫他靠老婆賣淫來過活；自有「將軍」兩字以來，從没有這樣倒霉過。然而於是也可見這位作者余一寳在很不聰明。他有了那樣一枝妙筆，要是肯寫寫什麼抗日將軍內戰將軍，那怕不名利雙收呢？</p>
<p>還有位女士沉櫻，居然反對女人們做良妻賢母來了；這是大悖聖教，尤不足訓。謹按：昔在五四之年，「革命尙未成功，」良妻賢母主義確曾爲有識者所詬病，但而今，「革命」早已成功，朝野同唱建設之調，賢母賢子，正含建設大　，所以女士的小說「　雨」「實爲時代錯誤。可見這位作者也不是善於應變的聰明人。</p>
<p>話已經多了，按下創作一門，再看别的文章。這一期裏有九篇論文，先看看題目，就覺得那些作者眞不可教訓。譬如說，整理國故，要得；但何以不做一篇「論明之亡亡於流寇，」而偏偏要作什麼「金瓶梅的著作時代及其社會背景？」甚至於還有「不到幾十年，火山口便爆發了！」那樣的混話，直欲把明末的大亂歸源於西門慶之流的大官人！</p>
<p>從論文跳到「書報副刋，」首先是畢樹棠的「最近英美雜誌裏的文學論文」呌我喫一驚。這位畢先生，又是個不可救藥的瓜。人家是不會像他那樣當眞把英美雜誌一本一本讀過來做那樣一篇文，卽使人家用了那樣的材料，可未必肯老老實實寫了個題目：最近英美雜誌裏的文學論文。人家一定寫上個「最近英美文藝思潮，」或更時髦些，「最近英美文壇的動向」云云。</p>
<p>總而言之，看完了這本「文學季刋」創刋號以後，我的總印象是：傻態可掬。人家方努力於做新式應制文，努力於造謠賣友，努力於鷄毛當令箭出風頭，敲詐，無奇不有，而文學季刋的一批人却眞想努力於什麼新文學的建設！他們自以爲與人無爭。獨不知道舉世皆傻瓜之日，固然不許有聰明人放乖，而舉世多聰明人之日，却也不許有傻瓜作怪的！不過這是題外之言了，耶歸正傳，倘使有人想看看喫力不討好的東西，不妨去買一本；在下作個義務廣吿：</p>

<h3>日出之前（四）</h3>
<p>— 高植</p>
<p>「媽，我們要有一天像三嬸媽這樣，就好了。」「只要你乖，聽媽的話，聽三嬸媽的話，就有一天會好的。」「眞的嗎？」連弟幻想到有一天自已也帶上了金戒指和金耳環，多榮耀呵！「可不是。」「媽，你在城隍廟求了什麼籤？」「」中上，好不好？「好。媽，籤上怎麼講？」「說你媽的苦日子快完了。說只要你肯孝順媽，聽媽的話就好了。」媽的話裏含着些什麼？媽平常總是說女兒要順遂上人，要吃苦。連弟以爲媽的話總還是這些，不必再問了，於是暫時沉默着，好久，她娘又囑咐道：「明天進城借米，不要心急，多住兩天也不要緊，記着，穿那件竹布褂子去。」「穿進城？借米還要穿新衣裳？留着過年穿吧。」「眞是傻丫頭。你衣裳不穿好一點，人家還以爲你是討飯的呢。」</p>
<p>連弟不作聲。秦大娘心想，連弟眞是一個好女兒呵。她想留下女兒身上的舊衣服，便說：「三嬸媽還要你穿好衣裳，才好帶你到大家裏去呢。三嬸媽會給你換的。這些身上的家裳」要點數，交給三嬸媽收着，可聽見了？」「曉得了。媽，怎麼旁人進城不穿新衣裳呢？」「誰進城不穿新衣裳？」</p>
<p>「媽進城燒香見城隍菩薩，就没有穿新衣裳。」「呆丫頭！做姑娘的到大家人家去，比不上我們可以隨便的。你媽是燒香，没有衣裳穿，也不要緊。記着，衣裳穿上了身，要弄齊整，不要弄縐。」連弟心裏有些歡喜，希望天快亮。上床臨睡時，她隨口說：「媽，我今天從來福的墳上走過的。他可曉得姊姊想念他？」秦大娘又傷心起來了。「怎不曉得呢！來福命苦呵。你老子若是爭氣的，我們也不遭這樣苦　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　了。眞是天數。要是來安有一天做了大店裏的「朝俸」，你的媽就好子。籤上說你媽明年要好了，你也要好，不跟媽一年到頭受罪了，你不是想來安好嗎？你好了，不要忘記了他和媽。好，你睡吧，明早上你還要進城。」連弟眞聽媽媽的話，慢慢睡去了。秦大娘却興奮地在床上盤算着，再也睡不着。連弟是無論如何不能再放在家裏受餓的，她不得不忍痛讓連弟去，這是她在痛苦中的一缐希望，她覺得把女兒去換錢原是十分疚心的事，她悲哀得幾乎要哭，可是她又想這是把女兒去去換「生路」，又加之她還希望在篾匠店裏做學徒的來安會因爲連弟而生活得好一些，便聊以自慰地把痛苦解除了一點。</p>
<p>她一夜没有睡，反復地盤算着。她聽不到鷄啼，不知道什麼時候天才會亮。一直焦燥地等到門縫裏有了一綫微弱的白光，她心裏還是懊惱着不得平靜，便起身了。平時她一定是呌女兒起來，可是現在她只躡手躡脚地離床穿了衣。在隣房裏的三嬸媽聽到聲音，也醒了，問了一聲：</p>
<p>「秦大娘，起來了麼？」「　　發白了。三嬸媽還睡一下吧。」「我也要起來了，趕早一點進城，」「不多睡一下麼？我先去燒水，你歇一下，不要緊」「連弟臨走之前秦大娘並未忘了催她穿上竹布褂。看着女兒的高興樣子，她心裏又難過了。「媽，我晚上就會趕回來。」「不要緊，没有米就等兩天，媽來接你。」</p>
<p>「媽，口袋呢？又没有籮，没有口袋，怎麼裝米？」秦大娘遲疑着，還不曾想到如何回答這個問題。三嬸媽便迅速地說：</p>

<p>新標準議而未行</p>
<p>日本紗力圖傾銷</p>
<p>棉紗改用新標準、傳說已久、現已沉寂、此中如何、非業外人所得知、亦正不必加以預測、茲聞此次所以改易標準、無非爲業中人見仁見智之不同、買賣交易眼光之各殊、加以挾有大量生產者、具有左右巿塲之能力、曰東則有隨之而東、曰西則有隨之而西、因此不無有壓抑弱小之處、遂致積隙旣深、一旦發作、羣策羣力、蜉蟻亦能挾螳螂以走、今日情形、正有類於此也、</p>
<p>棉紗自有交易所以來、標準有二、一爲恒豐紗廠之云鶴、爲物品交易所用作標準、及紗布交易所成立、其時物品之聲勢較煊赫紗布方面、欲求一與云鶴相等之棉紗、旣可相與頡頏、亦可互相轉套、遂選用申新紗廠出品之人鐘、其後棉紗買賣、逐漸集中於紗布、及紗布交易所新厦落成（卽現址）聲勢頓盛、其時之物品適因本所股交割發生風潮、所有紗花買賣、盡爲紗布棉業兩交易所分割以去、及後紗布以布疋之未能開拍（拍無幾時卽停）、加拍棉花、並棉業交易所之地位而有之、而造成今日之局面、人鐘旣爲申新出品、申新又有九廠之多、所出之紗、雖非皆爲人鐘、然其產量、當非一般廠家可比、茲略述申新各廠之生產能力如左、數字或有疏誤、還請閱者諒之、</p>

<h3>期粉交割數量</h3>
<p>達一二十一萬九千包</p>
<p>昨日爲一月份期粉交割、全日交割數量、爲過去一年中、足資考量之紀錄、計總數共達三十一萬九千包、內紅藍車二十萬零三千包、綠砲臺八萬九千包、綠丹鳳二萬包、綠麥根一千包、綠鷹球一千包、綠三星五千包、聞此批棧單、新貨占大部分、回籠貨祇數千包、至收貨者、聞爲本埠接近銀錢業之大囤户、客帮一無收去、而一月份巿面之經過、月初因實銷不暢、廠碼龐大、最低曾跌至二元零八分、後因客帮略有抽裝、及大多户之吸收抬住、步步盤高、結局曾軋高至二元二角二分半、差度亦達一角四分半、</p>
<h3>期麥交割進出兩少</h3>
<p>昨日月底、期麥無巿、現麥由顯新去宿州麥一車、價四元一角、與前巿相近、本月份交割進出兩少、昨日收解只有由六號解出一車、爲八號收去云、</p>
<h3>洋尖貨少獨漲角餘</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源近四十號、六千餘石、其巿况仍以北巿工人糾紛、未曾解决、此間人心猶能安穩、故自初巿起乎形勢頗見栗碌、惟大局蘊釀、究屬久疲乏神、殊難振作、故常帮蘇同帮等粳、祇好五分、杜尖無上落、獨洋尖因貨乏漲角餘、各帮晚稻、各家吃盤又復轉緊、故包胃雖續去二千包、巿况已呈定局、陰變元去路雖淡、到貨亦稀、故巿色又能帶緊、</p>
<p>（滬北）前日小車夫與肩運夫所肇之事、已載本報、滬北米業諸領袖向當局請願、經當局允爲調定工派警保護、各同行維民食計、均遵命辦理、至昨晨河下到貨二十餘號、各行交易不多、至午方行開手、惟所開之斛脚均爲數日做定者、故昨巿各行等於無巿、故無巿况可報、</p>
<h3>泉帮續辦客秈</h3>
<p>福州同時暢裝…巿價再漲一角</p>
<p>昨客秈巿况、到頭雖多、去化尤旺、閩省帮胃口甚濃、本街與寗波亦有辦意、而泉州帮日前一度辦裝後、因該地時局尙未完全安靖、深恐發生意外、辦裝後隨卽停乎、刻下該地戰事已可避免、附近一帶亦均平安、昨到巿採辦湖南機紅米機靖米機油米等共計二千四百七十六包、泉銷活動、巿面更形挺俏、而福州省帮辦興極濃、在巿與泉帮等竸爭辦裝、故各米續漲六七分至一角不等、統巿成交各米達八千包、除泉州外、本街與寗波去機尖一百三十包、蕪秈八百六十三包、其餘湘贛江北南京無錫各米統由福州辦去、後巿以本客活躍、形勢尙在看俏中、</p>
<p>油巿</p>
<h3>花生油趨勢良好</h3>
<p>昨花生油巿氣良好、來源不湧、去路不弱、行家心思交易甚强、故辦胃頗健、全巿計成交泊兒生油一百件、價開十元零六角、夾倉生油二千件、價爲十元零三角、輕皮生油六百件、價做九元六角、惟豆油較生油稍遜、因連電漲落不定、以致人心不穩、</p>
<h3>漢桕油連電報跌</h3>
<p>桕油在半月前因漢巿來源見稀、而各處正採辦備底、致銷路偶見暢旺、巿面因之稍漲、然辦者有一批辦就、卽吿停止、巿亦隨之穩定、迨至上週來源絡繹有到、銷路反見清淡、巿情復呈疲弱、且總結帳期已屆、銷塲當然稀少、然售者有須不得不售、於是非廉不足引動買心、故前昨兩日漢巿連電報跌、計重荊已開十六元二三角、平荊十五元七八角、獨麻城油尙在十五元七八角之間、似未跌足耳、本埠行家、對於進貨、本屬淡然、銷路亦已零落、惟近日曾到過客貨重荊千餘件均爲各行派開、價格聞祇每件二十元光景到盤、據係由宜昌運來云、</p>
<h3>南北貨木耳地價高漲</h3>
<p>木耳近以天寒關係、來源受阻、而地價亦於此時盛漲、據地頭電高什耳竟要九十元、照現申巿而論、前後雖已漲起十餘元、尙難合划、昨行盤普通什耳八十元至七十八元、後看再緊、</p>
<h3>絲茶外匯放長影響絲銷</h3>
<p>（華絲運美成弩末）美國向爲銷用華絲最巨之國、最盛時期月有四五千包運往美屬、近年來因受日本絲與人造絲之侵銷、華絲美銷極度衰落、上月（卽一月）中由滬輸美之華絲數量、已成弩末、全月共祇二百九十五包、均係白廠經、其餘黄白灰各絲經均無運美、</p>
<p>（雙宮絲供不敷求）邇來雙宮絲春銷發動、印度需要益旺、奈滬埠雙宮絲廠祇福綸一家工作、絲產不豐、供不敷求、上月（卽一月）份運往印度之雙宮絲、共達二百二十八包、</p>
<p>（洋莊絲待時而動）海外生絲巿塲、因銷令已屆、現絲巿價日趨堅漲、紐約里昂昨晨雖有來電探詢黄白廠經巿價、惜外匯續長、華絲商因扯價不合、仍具待時而動之槪、昨祇信孚進白廠經二十包、中和進灰經二十包、價漲五六元、</p>
<h3>蝦目珠茶略有走銷</h3>
<p>本埠洋莊茶巿、近來異常疲滯、土莊珍眉綠茶、日前恊和怡和等行、雖因華商讓價求售、略有電報發出、但並無回音、針眉秀眉等項連日亦無人問及、惟低莊蝦目珠茶、昨由錦隆天祥等行買進五十餘箱、扯價四十八元、較前見跌四五元、此外綠茶花香末片、店莊去路、亦頗活動云、巿價</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>富翁厭棄阿堵物</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>咱們中國在古昔的時候，曾經有過一個文人對於金錢厭惡之至，呌金錢不呌金錢而呼曰阿堵物，卽是厭惡這種東西連它的名字都厭惡者也。可是，這文人並非富翁，他厭惡金錢的原因，大槪是因為缺乏金錢，受了金錢的壓迫而厭惡金錢，這在金錢世界的現社會上，並不為奇。報載希臘的雅典有一個大富翁大實業家名呌賴麻氏者，特發怪癖，在他的住宅的樓頭，以一百五百及一千特拉格曼（希臘幣名）的鈔票向下散播。給過往的路人爭相搶取。在這全世界經濟恐慌，富者益富貴者益貧的矛盾社會，窮人之對於金錢，心裏固然厭惡眼裏却是發亮，也難怪雅典的窮人聽到富翁散播鈔票不約而集者千萬人，爭相搶取空中飛舞的鈔票，以至「爭呶化為暴亂。」</p>
<p>富翁因為拚命攫有了金錢然後才成為其富翁，現在這洋富翁却說是他對於這種齷齪錢財深惡痛絕，並且說是他深受阿堵物之累，感覺厭倦，這也就足以知道金錢這種東西給人厭惡無論貧富了。　　考上古之時，貿易之道只是以物易物，後來不知是誰却發明以錢幣作中間流通的法寳，自從社會上有了這種法寳以來，本是人用法寳，其後却是法寳用人了，這發明家說亦可惡之至。我國歷史稗傳以及傳說神話對於發明火者說是燧人氏，對於發明醫藥者說是神農氏，對於發明航海的羅盤指南針者。說是黄帝，可是對於這錢幣的發明家，却是並無明文紀載，大槪「始作俑者其無後乎」，他連名字都没世而名不宣了。這錢幣發明家之所以没世而名不宣的原因，又可以說是古之人也深惡痛絕於金錢，不願有如宣揚燧人氏神農氏的盛德一樣將他的大名流傳後世了。</p>
<p>春秋之世，孔子曰「富而可求，雖執鞭之士吾亦為之，」足見在那時已經有了富人，而且在那時的富人已經了不得，所以孔子雖然不願求富，但亦教子貢以貨殖之道。不過聖人如孔子者尙且只是不願求富而並不對於金錢深惡痛絕，可見金錢的魔力聖人亦莫如之何。現在這希臘國裏的洋富翁竟是厭惡起金錢來，難道他比較咱們中國的聖人還了不得？</p>
<p>報載後來警士以他是「神經錯亂，卽送入某醫院，」這在資本社會的國家要維持資本制度的尊嚴，自然以他是「神經錯亂」最為良法，可是再不能够聽到這一位厭棄金錢的富翁的言論實在可惜。</p>
<p>在上海的富翁們，並没有聽見他們對於金錢厭棄，其實一成為富翁，便有被綁票匪綁架勒索之虞，行動不自由，提心吊膽，明明是受了金錢之累，他們怎麼甘願如此？這所以金錢制度是特别偉大的原因吧？可是，在窮人看來，這一種金錢制度，卽是造成萬惡社會的泉源總機關，誰都在咒詛誰都在深惡痛絕，此所以社會就不會安寗的原因吧？　　假如全世界的富翁都厭棄金錢，天下一定太平，我作如是想。</p>
<h3>减租運動</h3>
<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>近日本巿各團體因　於淞滬戰後，巿面狀况，日益蕭條，而各處房租，非但未見减輕，甚有還在增加，多要求减低房租，以輕負但，而復興巿廛繁榮計，特組一委員會，作减租運動之舉，這是件値得我人注意的事。</p>
<p>人生問題，切要者除衣食而外，當然要算是住了。上海為我國通商大埠，全巿人口，已達三百餘萬之多，是住的問題，已成為社會上一個嚴重的問題。自來上海房租之昂貴，本為全國各地冠，而一般擁有房產者，又每只知自肥，不顧民生，時有加租之舉，到無數居民，終年血汗所得，幾大半盡輸於房東。影響所及，個人生計的感受困迫，自不待言，巿面亦將因之而衰敗，社會亦必隨之而呈不安之象。補救之道，捨减租外，别無良策。故减租運動，實為今日解决居民居住問題應有的正當行為。蓋解决居住問題，不僅可以使個人能得安居樂業、同時亦足以促進巿塲的繁興，維持社會的寗靜。　　但我人對於該運動，雖一面表示十分贊助之忱，一面尙不免覺有一大缺陷。卽該會所欲致力者，似乎只在代表各商舖及各二房東對大房東的一種减租的要求，而於三房客，則蓋置諸腦後。這從該會的議决案可以看出。　　於此，我人要問一問，一法的居民，租屋居住者，商舖及二房東外，不是尙有所謂三房客嗎？全巿三房客究有多少，雖没有統計，爲數之衆，當可斷言。而且二房東又常將白已所遭大房東的壓迫，轉加諸三房客的身上，是則三房客所受的痛苦，亦不亞於二房東。今二房東旣不願忍受大房東的盤剝，起而作减租之要求，實爲情勢所使然。而三房客不也是一樣有充分的理由以反抗二房東的榨取的嗎，故我以爲該會如果僅僅是代表二房東說話，那末這種運動，還是不澈底的運動，於全體的居民，亦是没有多大影響的。或許有人說，大房東的房租一减低，不但二房東直接受其賜，卽三房客亦間接沾其利了。蓋二房東所要求的目的一達到，對於三房家的租金，自然也就可以减輕了。我想這話也未必盡是。須知人類的本性是自私的，二房東雖然自身覺得痛楚，向大房東去呼籲，但他們對於三房客的境遇，也不一定就會同情，就肯退讓。故我以爲社會人士如果眞有心要解蘇民困，復興巿面，維護社會，這個减租運動，該須澈底而且普遍，不惟對大房東應作减租的要求，卽對二房東，亦須作同樣的勸吿。這樣於上海大多數的住民，才是有益，而於巿塲的繁榮，社會的安寗，亦才有所補救！</p>
<h3>理想生活的自白</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>一般人一提起做人，便好像非削尖頭皮鑽入這惡濁的社會不可似的，可是，我却最恨這種論調。我總覺得這是種奴性的發揮，是種人的卑劣行爲最刻骨的暴露。爲什麼做人一定要奴顏婢膝呢？爲什麼做人定要去仰承那般污濁者流的鼻息，而苟且偸生？這種人性的乖離，我是不解的。我不解爲甚麼他們一定要鑽進這所謂職業的社會，而互相排擠着，傾軋着，把人家打倒自已却飛奔上去代替他？爲什麼他們定要這樣的卑劣呢？假使人類的生命是要以這樣卑劣的行爲去替它着色的，那他們爲什麼不遽然地死去？</p>
<p>在我，我是與他們叛離的。我不能有他們這種存心。假使我要有這種存心　　那麼我早已非我。而早是他們中的一員了。</p>
<p>在我，雖然一樣的覺得生來了就只得願存的生，但我却没有他們那樣去生的意見；要是我去奴顏婢膝，仰承人家鼻息的生，那我最好早就死去。因爲所謂生，就要有種高貴的意義，一種生命意識的活躍，是無論怎樣都不會在這種奴顏婢膝上表現它的尊貴的。</p>
<p>我將怎樣擇取生活的方式呢？我，認定是要這樣的：我將决計像那些昔賢似的過着隱士生活，我寗願淡泊，寗願在羣山萬壑中隱棲着而寂然無聞。我不去拜訪甚麼偉人，也不親近什麼權貴。讓自然永是醇然而聖潔地臨着我，讓明月爲我作伴，讓清泉爲我照心！讓那社會的制裁，社會的束縛永遠的離開我。</p>
<p>從這種清靜的生活裏，讓我沉浸在那般古代詩人的詩靈中，讓我這顆不被勢利薰染着的心，永遠和這般偉大的聖潔的心同在着。至於世界，我願拋棄給那般勢利之徒，讓他們在會訪中以炸彈手槍相見吧！讓他們朋友陷害着朋友，親人陷害着親人！………</p>
<p>也許有人要駡我在信口雌黄，但這正是他錯了！在這種污濁而無法挿足的社會裏，能够從一切紛爭中㧞足跑出來，不但不傲岸旁觀，而且率然的隱去，這不能不說是另有一種自然的心境吧！難道這樣一點都不擾攘人家，一點都不干預人家的生活也是世人所不許的麼？要是連這點也不要，那這眞是暴世了！「夫復何言」！</p>
<h3>愛情商品化的必然性</h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>一般人（也許我亦在內）每每痛絕現代女人的愛情被金錢蹂躪了，簡直成了商品，話雖不錯，其實乃是事實所必然，這世界有什麼東西不被金錢蹂躪呢？更有那一種東西不成了商品呢？辛克萊的屠塲裏，關於殺牛塲的情形，曾有過這樣的描寫，他說因爲機器的組織嚴密，不論是牛肉，牛皮，牛骨，牛毛都不會任意的蹧蹋半點，就是牛血，牛糞也都各有它的用處；唯一不能使它成爲商品的，祇是牛被殺葉，那慘痛的呼聲。這當然是種刻　的描寫，也是種眞實的描寫，因爲現社會的精神就是如此。</p>
<p>假使我們知道現社會不但是體力勞動成爲商品，並且就是智力勞動也使之成爲商品之後，我們對於現社會之使愛</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>情成為商品，也將不會驚奇了。工人要生活他們便出賣他們的勞動力。智識分子如學者，教授，哲學家，文學家，藝術家，科學家等，　為要生活，他們便出賣着智識，著作，藝術品，新發明。而一個女人為要使她自已生存，在她没有比肉體比愛情更好的東西去出賣的時候，她便祇得將她的唯一的肉體愛情出賣給那買者了。這其間為的是生存問題，假使一個人能够體念得求生的那種熱切的要求，他對於這種為生存而出賣着自已最實貴的東西，也將會無怪其然了。一個現代的女子本來是難得謀生的，假使我們注意到她們的才能，她們的體質，她們的地位，必能了解這點。就是她們和男子們站在一個平等的地位，也是難得戰勝男子，何况她們是處在一種比男子不同的地位？我們知道，凡是人都是要生存的，女人當然不會例外。可是她們憑藉什麼去生存呢？這里便是她們出賣愛情的最大理由。她們是動人的，是騒蕩的，這動人和騒蕩的兩大原素便構成了她們成為商品的主要成分。加以，她們是特别喜歡虛榮，而虛榮的表現又都是些要用許多金錢才可以購得來的什物。於是她們的當然購買者，也當然是那些有錢的，能够常常買這些高貴的什物來滿足她們的虛榮的購買者了。</p>
<p>照一般的說來，祇有動人的儀容，青年的英俊，一種殷勤的熱烈的心情，才是引起女人發生愛情的原素，本來這是對的。不過這些東西到底不是金錢，在她們想，那管是一個非常英俊可愛的青年，假使祇能在一間低矮的穢臭的草棚中去安置着他的愛人，這將會是一件多麼痛心的事。所以在我們看來，靈榮彷彿是不重要，然而這在女人凑不能這樣想。在封建社會里，人的高低是以爵位來表現的，那時是有窮得不名一文的貴族受人敬重，高貴的宴會上常有穿着破綻的貴族服的事實。這種，那管窮得没有一文錢，穿着破衣也還受人尊敬，便是封建制度特有的本質。回頭，我們再看到現資本主義社會，有錢便受人尊敬，當然是同樣的必然現象。一個人能够對她的環境反抗什麼呢？假使她的環境要她這麼做。所以我覺得，我們也用不着去詛咒她們，因為她們原是那麼柔弱而可憐啊。</p>
<p>然而我也並不是没有顧及這種以愛情為麵包的青年問題，不過我覺得這個問題是不能與詛咒她們混在一起的。當然，愛情成為商品是件不好的事情，我並也覺得這不好的事情是更不好於我們一般的青年的。不過我總覺得這不是社會制裁的問題，也不是教育的問題，更不是詛咒的問題，這問題是直接關係於現社會的存在呵！想從社會制裁這點來解决這問題、决没有成效。因為在這現社會中，有誰能施其制裁？換一說，想從教育方面去消滅它，也不會有什麼成功。因為在這現社會中，教育根本已失了主宰。若是說到詛咒，那根本是不能解决什麼事情的，只不過徒然自擾一陣罷了。</p>
<p>假使我們要使愛情不成不商品，那………恕我在此停嘴擱筆。｜｜完｜</p>
<h3>雅典富翁的豪舉</h3>
<p>— 木郎</p>
<p>日前報載雅典電訊：</p>
<p>此處有大富翁大實業家名賴麻氏者，今日特發怪癖，自其住宅之樓頭，以一百五百及一千特拉格曼（希臘幣名）之鈔幣，向下散播，使路人爭相攫取。此種消息瞬忽傳佈全城，不約而集者千萬人，爭相攫取空中飛舞之鈔紙。迨警士到塲彈壓之時，爭呶已化為暴亂。遂不得不調動後備軍士，前來驅散羣衆。後警士復入賴麻之宅中，禁止其再以鈔票下擲。惟賴見警士入其室，卽將其面前堆　如山之鈔票撕裂；並向警士稱：彼對於此種齷齪錢財，深惡痛絕，並謂彼深受阿堵物之累，頗感壓倦去。警士以其神經錯亂，卽送之入某醫院。而其家族稽其賬籍，彼頃刻所散佈者，已在十萬特拉格曼以上云。</p>
<p>這則駭人聽聞的消息，隨着它的傳佈的力量，震撼了全世界第一地每一財迷的心竅。我們想像，當那位大富翁賴麻氏在撒着他的鈔票的時候，屋下羣衆如痴如狂地爭奪的狀態，够多麼熱烈囂亂？我不能確正那種熱狂的狀態是到了怎樣一個地步，但是我想，幾年前某烟草公司曾在上海用飛機自高空散下可換香烟的傳單，卽時在街頭引頸企望的一般男女老少的希冀的神情，或可想像現在的雅典富翁屋下的羣衆的狂態於萬一。</p>
<p>然而，闢開羣衆的描寫，値得我們注意的却是那位大富翁的歇斯低里地的舉動。不是心理學家，我不能確定那位富翁是否屬於變態的一種，然而至少他的神經系統突然缺乏了條理，這是毫無疑義的。往往聽見有人說，别的事情多做了，便覺得膩煩，例如飯喫得太飽了，就要打惡心，睡眠睡得太足了，也要生睡病。惟有錢財這樣東西，任憑怎樣，却没有人嫌它太多的。可是現在不然，現在也有人壓惡起錢財來了，不，非但壓惡，甚至還要把代表錢財的鈔票撕毁，這不是有違於常態的進化的嗎？　　固然，在表面上，賴麻氏將鈔票分散於羣衆，這是一種不可多得的善舉或豪舉，但細究其實，果然他是在佈賜着衆生嗎？這祇要看他對警士的談話：彼對於此種齷齪錢財，深惡痛絕……就可以知道决不是的。他並且說，「深受阿堵物之累，頗感壓倦。」是則他對於錢財的所以「深惡痛絕，」正是向來過分「嗜財若命」的反應。從佛教的理論講，這就是因果循環。我們中國古書上有一名話道「利令智昏」，也可以為賴氏的寫照。　　在中國，從來不曾聽見過像這種新聞，因此像賴氏般的「戇大」在中國也决難找到。不過，從日常生活上，我們也往往可以體味出和賴氏一樣的苦痛的心情，但我們的機遇比較小或淡漠，因此我們的感覺也就不得　淺了。</p>
<p>譬如某人在某日買到了一張航空獎劵，就從卽日起，到開彩日止，他幾乎是每晚上要失眠的。等到開彩後知道自已所買的號碼並没有中，他倒反而泰然了。在這幾十或幾天的焦思苦慮中，他準得减少幾磅體重。萬一他中了頭獎，這對於他的精神體力，將更是一重怎樣苛劇的麼難啊！也許我的話未免說得過火，但我還覺得是就一般的對象說的。　　然而遭受磨難的人却從不怨怪過他們所受的磨難的頒賜者。也許他們連自已的受苦是誰在作崇都不知道，當然更無從怨怪起了。　　富翁未始不可做得，財也未始不可發得，但做了富翁，有了錢財，反要受精神上的牽制或磨折，那末財富之於人，是否一種幸福，是空受了許多痛苦，連財也没有發成，而空受了許多痛苦，如買發財票者！　　於此，雅典富翁的找到了發洩痛苦的對象｜｜把鈔票撕裂，倒是聰明而又値得效法的藥方，因為至少他可以從此心無掛碍了。</p>
<h3>處世一訣</h3>
<p>— 雪菲</p>
<p>往常講究處世的，總不過是以下兩事：一是拍馬，二是吹牛。這是衆人皆知的事實。最近我才又新發展了一個處世方訣。這便無論什麼人，先要把他當作壞人看，心裏有什麼話　　於無論什麼人，切不可就隨便的　　　　對於人家的話，也不可以隨便就相信。就是說，對於無論什麼人，總要帶三分虛僞。</p>
<p>本來，虛僞也可歸入吹牛中的一部分，然而這裏凑有特别提出來研究的必要。何以故？因為這是普通人還不大注意的一個處世方訣。而我尤其是因為不懂這個處世方訣而受到很大的實害的人，所以對於這門秘訣特别有心得，為自。已有資格來講一講這個問題。</p>
<p>我的所以不懂這門秘訣而受實害的事實，就是因為我過於相信了朋友講了許多老實話，結果為這朋友所賣。由於這一經騐，我才知道說話是不能過於老實的，老實就會做上海人所謂的「曲死」。本來這是有點經騐的人都知道的，我的所以被朋友所賣，並不是什麼意外奇遇，是社會上常見之事，然而我竟不知。不獨我不知，恐怕社會上一般青年像我這樣糊塗的還多着罷。　這是個人私事，不足稱道，那末我們來講社會上比較範圍大一點的事體我們看，社會上那一件事才是眞實的。我們知道，報上廣吿根本上就没有可信的理由，他的說話，起碼要打×折。然而所謂新聞也者，又是以有「聞必錄」為原則，其所聞究屬如何，只有天知地知之了。　　那末整個社會根本都是不眞實的了嗎？是又不然。從另一方面看來，社會上事又件件是眞實的。這話怎講？這要橫的方面從利害關係組合上去看，縱的方面要從利害關係的前後的遞嬗演變上去看。我們知道，社會的組合，根本是利害關係的組合；而社會的演進，又是這利害關係的遞嬗與變化。認清了這一點，然後我們才可以把握到事實的中心。假使你能把他們中間的利害關係弄清楚，那没有一件不是很簡單的，這就是一切來赤裸裸的只有利害關係。什麼道德　　總不過是　人的，澈底的說，所謂道德情誼，根本也是其築於利害關係之上，没有利害關係，就没有所謂道德情誼。在古代是如此，要現代更是如此。假使你要丢了利害關係去從别的方面推求，那你對於一切事都會茫無頭緒，只覺左又不是，右又不是。　　世間一切事，旣然唯有利害關係才是最眞的眞實，那末我們的處世方訣便可知道了。這就是只有從利害關係中才能求到你眞正的挈友。他和你要好時，他决不是眞心愛你，而是有所利用於你；到不需要你時，他是不妨就一腳踢開你的。你假使當作他眞心待你好，因為你誠心誠意去對待他，那便大錯而特錯了，結果你一定為他所愚弄。這是一個處世要訣。</p>

<h3>孤獨的人（三）</h3>
<p>— 黛妮</p>
<p>（二）滬杭道上</p>
<p>隨卽克佳帮着效蓀料理行裝。所謂行裝也者，也簡單得很，幾套隨身衣服，日常用品，及書籍等。一切整束之後，克佳說：　　「我還是前天到杭州來的，看你兩次，老媽子說已兩天没有回來。住到家里去恐怕老祖母說我結婚的時候還東跑西跑，所以住在湖濱旅館，旣然我們明天動身，我去算清了房金，今晚上同床而眠，如何？　　「好！没有教訓完的話嗎？」　　效蓀說着笑了起來。回到寫字椅里，架起了腿，習慣地從烟罐中抽出兩枝烟來，一枝授給克佳說：　　「還是抽香烟罷。</p>
<p>野牛牽動了一下嘴角，把要說的話嚥住在喉頭。兩個燃上火，他就出門去了。</p>
<p>效蓀掠着天然鬆曲的頭髮，白色的烟噴出來，隨了春風向窗外飛散種種地　　果然，這天晚上，他們談了一夜的天，他們談到效蓀和勤菠的戀愛，「失戀是不是苦痛的」，談到克佳和靜宜的「把戲」是不是點綴人生的，一切悲哀掉在歡樂的後面。天色已不知不覺的第二天開始了。效蓀呼喚老媽子起身，梳洗完畢，趕開往上海的早車。　　效蓀雖說是養病，這般早起，到西子湖畔來後還是第一朝。　　遙望太陽從山凹中吐出來，那黄金色的光茫照到湖面上，三月的春風吹過，水面波動着柳絲的倒影，好似萬條金蛇從清澈的水底湧泳上來。效蓀抬起天然鬆曲的頭髮，輕輕地舒一口氣，在黄包車上自語着：　　「我今天認識西子的美麗了。」</p>
<p>車夫腿打着屁股，在晨風中很快的抵火車站。效蓀神經質地對整個杭桓暼了一眼，似乎離别新婚的妻子一樣，雖然在厭棄生活的平凡，但是三個月的勾留，情不自禁地的愛戀起來。　　「矛盾的人生呵！」克佳瞧透了效蓀的心緒，唱贊美詩似的笑着。　　在嘈雜的人羣中坐上了火車，一聲汽笛車子蠕蠕地開動。兩個人没有說話。兩種不同的思潮佔據着各人的心頭。身子隨着舒適的坐墊感到和諧的節凑，在這種安閑的環境中，將他們送入了矇矓睡鄕。　　兩旁的田嚋，屋宇，向後倒去，一列長車怒吼着前進，在嘉興車站停住的時候，他們被女子的喊聲驚醒過來。效蓀舉起頭來見對座一個女子笑容可掬的注視着，以為這女子笑他們好睡，不好意思的假裝向月台上閒眺。克佳抬了抬眼皮，仍低下頭去那女子見没有注意到自已，就靠近這隔開兩座的小桌，側着頭說：　　「克佳，到上海了。」</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Criticism of Stalin's Report</h3>
<p>Success</p>
<p>The dictator of the Soviet Communist Party delivered a report at the Seventeenth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party. It began by analyzing the current state of the world economy, followed by the achievements of the Soviet Union since the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan. It then provided a detailed analysis of the international political situation and stated the Soviet Union's position. The final conclusion reiterated the achievements of the Five-Year Plan and contained a slightly revolutionary tone. Overall, we acknowledge the realization of the Soviet Union's First Five-Year Plan and the Soviet people's efforts to achieve their projected ideals, and recognize their spirit as an example for all countries in the world, which is especially worthy of study and attention by the world amidst the deepening economic panic. However, there are still some things we must say.</p>
<p>First, since the Great Revolution, the Soviet Union has regarded itself as the leader of the world revolution. However, since the implementation of the New Economic Policy, it has focused its efforts on domestic economic construction. While superficially maintaining the banner of world revolution, it has actually been engaged in the organization of Russia itself. Any compromise is acceptable as long as it benefits Russia. Therefore, it can sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan in pursuit of peace, sell oil to seek stability, conclude non-aggression pacts with Central European countries, and even express goodwill towards Italy, which stands at the opposite extreme. Not long ago, France, which the Soviet Union considered to be an anti-Soviet leader, also concluded a non-aggression pact. From all of the above, it can be seen that the Soviet Union's actual international actions are contrary to its usual theory. Stalin's report this time is also inconsistent in this regard. As for the world situation it has analyzed over the years, it often deviates far from reality. It believes that capitalism will collapse immediately and exaggerates that capitalist countries will attack the Soviet Union. In fact, the claim that capitalist countries will attack the Soviet Union is long gone. Now, the Soviet Union is improving relations with them one by one. Only Japan in the East remains in opposition. In this case, where is the reliability of Stalin's report?</p>
<p>Second, Stalin's report expressing deep satisfaction with the Chinese Communist Party is even more inconsistent with the facts. The Third International's misjudgment of the future of the Chinese revolution is not new. Because of its mistakes, more disputes have arisen in our country, leading to the suspicion of interfering in our internal affairs. At the beginning of the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, it was already stated that they would not interfere in each other's internal affairs and would not engage in propaganda against each other. The Soviet Union treats the United Kingdom and the United States in the same way, and even Japan in the Far East. In fact, for example, the Soviet Union cannot instruct its party members to promote doctrines that are unfavorable to their country in the opponent's country or to use illegal actions. At the same time, the opposing country must not use White Russians to form organizations and propaganda against the Soviet Union. This is common knowledge. In the past, the Soviet Union could still use the excuse that the Soviet Union and the Third International are not in the same category and that the Communist Party's organization is not under the command of the Soviet Union to shirk responsibility. But in fact, the Soviet Union and the Third International are not only the same in origin, but also act in the same way. All countries in the world are also clearly aware of this, without any doubt. However, the Soviet authorities skillfully use it to avoid excessively blatant traces. However, Stalin's report this time clearly favored the Chinese Communist Party. It not only favored it, but even vigorously promoted it and cited it as an aid. This kind of argument is both contrary to the Soviet Union's usual so-called peaceful diplomacy and has the suspicion of helping China's internal chaos and interfering in China's internal affairs. It is greatly contrary to the original intention of resuming diplomatic relations and friendship. This is what we cannot but critically criticize in Stalin's report.</p>
<p>We dare to tell Mr. Stalin frankly that no country in the world today can erase its past history. In other words, the boundaries between countries cannot be removed in a short period of time. At a time when national consciousness is flourishing, the Soviet Union must also devote its efforts to national defense construction. Our country has been extremely invaded by various countries. The only way out for China is to promote the inherent spirit of our nation. Sun Yat-sen had a clear teaching long ago. The Three Principles of the People, as indicated in 1927, were once acknowledged and considered correct by Lenin, the creator of the Soviet Union. In recent times, things have remained the same. The suffering of secondary colonies is even greater than in the past. Stalin's promotion of the Communist Party, which engages in murder, arson, and inciting peasant riots, not only shows that his understanding of the world situation has fallen into a mechanical and one-sided observation, but also that his observation of China has never been recognized.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Revises Tariff Regulations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance instructed the Director General of Customs that the revision of the tariff regulations should be adapted to the times, and those that are not very compatible with the current trade situation should be slightly changed. Therefore, with reference to the recent market conditions of kerosene and gasoline, the existing import tax has been levied. Kerosene is levied at 0.1137 gold units per unit, and gasoline is levied at 0.47 gold units per unit. Now, the revised and increased tariff regulations are as follows: 520 mineral gasoline and naphtha gasoline, (including various unnamed engine fuels) A. Boxed, 2.10 gold units per 100,000 gallons, B. Bulk, 2.00 gold units per 10 US gallons. 532 Kerosene (including other mineral oils for ignition, with a specific gravity of 0.78 to 0.90) A. Boxed, 1.80 gold units per 100,000 gallons, B.

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Preparing for Negotiations on Sino-British and Sino-American Treaty Revisions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Both the Sino-US and Sino-British treaties have reached their expiration dates. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a note to both countries to conclude new treaties. The US government replied that it had accepted the note. The British Embassy in China has issued a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that it has telegraphed the Chinese note to the British government and will reply after receiving instructions. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the principles for concluding a new treaty have been roughly prepared. Although the issue of consular jurisdiction is not related to the commercial treaty itself, it is related to it. When China and the United Kingdom and the United States revised the issue of consular jurisdiction in 1930, the countries also indicated that they would gradually abolish it as China's judicial reforms progressed. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared to raise the issue of abolishing consular jurisdiction when discussing the commercial treaty with the United States and the United Kingdom. As for when the Sino-US negotiations will officially begin, it is still difficult to decide. (31st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Economic Committee Plans to Hold Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Standing Committee Decides on Levee Protection Plan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Committee's third standing committee meeting on the 27th decided on matters such as this year's national highway and water conservancy construction, as well as the selection and establishment dates of the Jiangxi Northwest offices. However, important cases that the standing committee cannot resolve, such as the allocation of US cotton and wheat loans requested by various parties and the establishment of various control committees, all await the decision of the entire committee. It is planned to convene the first plenary committee meeting in Nanjing around March 10 to discuss the aforementioned major cases. In addition to the 34 official members and 5 standing committee members, three legislators specially appointed by the Legislative Yuan will participate in the plenary committee meeting, as well as one or two representatives from each provincial government (director of the construction department or industry department) to clarify the construction situation in each province and the steps to be taken. Notification letters will be issued within days. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Committee's third standing committee meeting decided that the Yangtze River bank protection plan should focus on planting turf on the levee body as the sole important project for levee protection, and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau will be responsible for handling it. The required funding is still being estimated. (31st Dispatch) (Nanjing) The Economic Committee will conduct salt land reclamation in Lianghuai and will convene a meeting of relevant agencies in the coming days to discuss a design plan.

<h3>Provincial System to be Reformed Soon</h3>
<p>Legislative Yuan to Amend Provincial Organization Law</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The reform of the provincial system was proposed and passed again at the Fourth Plenary Session. According to a certain person in charge, the reform of the provincial governor system had already been passed by the Third Plenary Session and submitted to the Executive Yuan for its opinions. The Executive Yuan proposed that the civil affairs, finance, education, and construction departments should remain, and a director of the political affairs department should be added to assist the governor in handling provincial affairs. During the discussion at this Fourth Plenary Session, slight modifications were made. In addition to the education and construction departments remaining, a deputy governor and a political affairs department were added. The political affairs department is divided into general affairs, civil affairs, and finance divisions, with the deputy governor concurrently serving as the director of the political affairs department, assisting the governor in handling all matters in order to concentrate authority and achieve practical results. It is heard that all parties attach great importance to this plan and are strongly urging its implementation. In the shortest possible time, the Legislative Yuan will be instructed to amend the provincial organization law and re-formulate it for implementation. It is expected that this will be realized in the second half of this year. (31st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Comparison of US and Japanese Navies</h3>
<p>Japan has the Advantage in Destroyers and Submarines</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Previously, on the 27th, Mr. Uchida Shinya raised a question at the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives. Therefore, the Navy made a public statement to the Budget Committee on the comparison of the naval strength of Japan and the United States after the completion of the second supplementary accounting of the Japanese Navy. The current status of battleships is as follows:</p>
<p>United States: 15 ships, totaling 455,400 tons</p>
<p>Japan: 9 ships, totaling 272,070 tons</p>
<p>As of 1936, the United States had 7 warships that exceeded their age limit, while Japan had 4. Due to the London Treaty, the construction of replacement warships was not permitted. Therefore, by the end of 1936, their actual strength was:</p>
<p>Japan: 5 ships, 154,750 tons</p>
<p>United States: 8 ships, 251,600 tons</p>
<p>The ratio is 62%. The strength of aircraft carriers as of 1936 is as follows:</p>
<p>Japan: 5 ships, 78,420 tons</p>
<p>United States: 5 ships, 119,800 tons</p>
<p>The ratio is 65%. The strength of Class A cruisers is as follows due to the restrictions of the London Treaty:</p>
<p>Japan: 12 ships, 107,800 tons</p>
<p>United States: 16 ships, 152,650 tons</p>
<p>(Two more are under construction)</p>
<p>The ratio is 71%. Class B cruisers are as follows:</p>
<p>Japan: 17 ships, 98,799 tons</p>
<p>United States: 14 ships, 20,500 tons</p>
<p>The ratio is 89%. The comparison of destroyers within the age limit is as follows:</p>
<p>Japan: 76 ships, 105,111 tons</p>
<p>United States: 46 ships, 67,360 tons</p>
<p>The ratio is 1.56. Japan shows an absolute advantage. Japan also shows an absolute advantage in submarines:</p>
<p>Japan: 35 ships, 52,553 tons</p>
<p>United States: 24 ships, 32,670 tons</p>
<p>The ratio is 1.61. The total strength of auxiliary ships (cruisers, destroyers, submarines) is as follows:</p>
<p>Japan: 140 ships, 364,259 tons</p>
<p>United States: 100 ships, 363,180 tons</p>
<p>Although Japan has 40 more ships, the tonnage is about equal. (31st Joint Dispatch)</p>
<p>Soviet Stratosphere Exploration</p>
<h3>Three Aviators Perish</h3>
<p>Ascended 12.87 Miles</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet stratosphere balloon "Siriyahes" has met with misfortune. The three aviators in the balloon chamber have been found on the Moscow Katzabon Railway and have all perished. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet balloon "Siriyahes," which set a new record for ascending into the stratosphere yesterday, has been searched for all night without any trace. Radio communication with the balloon has been interrupted since last night. It is generally believed that the balloon must have fallen into the forest, but airplanes and other search parties have been unable to locate it. There is currently a thick fog here. The Soviet Director of Civil Aviation has issued a radio message ordering all flight stations to assist in the search. Stalin and others are particularly anxious. (31st National Dispatch) (Moscow) The Soviet stratosphere balloon "Siriyahes" ascended at 9:07 this morning. By 11:45, it had reached a height of 67,568 feet, or 12.87 miles. At noon, the balloon began to descend and landed safely in the afternoon. During the ascent, the three people in the balloon chamber communicated with the ground continuously. Another Soviet balloon, "Soviet," had previously ascended to a height of 11.5 miles. This record has now been broken by "Siriyahes." (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Opening of the New German Parliament</h3>
<p>Hitler Elaborates on Political Achievements</p>
<p>National Socialism Saves the Country from Peril. Diplomacy Based on International Harmony</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today marks the first anniversary of German Chancellor Hitler's rule. The German Parliament convened a special meeting with great solemnity. The parliament was filled to capacity, and the people gathered outside the parliament were also overflowing. When the Chancellor arrived at the parliament, the people cheered and paid their respects. When the Chancellor entered the parliament, everyone in the chamber stood up and raised their hands in the party salute.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>First, General Göring, the chairman of the parliament, gave a speech, stating the achievements made by the National Socialist government in the past year. He said that even in a superficial comparison, it can be found that the development of the country's various affairs in the past year has made the German nation, under the command of the National Socialist leader, seem to have been reborn. In terms of diplomacy, Germany has also been able to make countries admire Germany's attempts, beliefs, and achievements in a very short period of time. Göring also said that all members of the government today share the same political and philosophical beliefs and serve the same work program. This is the first time in German history. Therefore, the only task of the German Parliament from now on is to implement the national construction program promulgated by the leader Hitler. (30th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>Then, Chancellor Hitler took the stage to give a speech, briefly stating that the history of the world in the past fifteen years has been controlled by two facts: first, the authority of the state has been undermined by Marxism; second, the Versailles Treaty adopted intimidating and fraudulent means in politics and economics, causing people to lose faith in the world order.</p>
<h3>Abhors the Treaty of Versailles</h3>
<p>The Treaty of Versailles caused people to lose all hope, resulting in resentment. The German people have lost faith in "justice" and harbor resentment towards the international situation. The Communist Party took the opportunity to rise and engage in its tricks.</p>
<h3>Rescues People from Disaster</h3>
<p>The National Socialist Party rose to protect Germany from being ravaged by the Communist Revolution. Saving Germany is therefore saving the entire world from being devastated by the world revolution.</p>
<h3>All Ethnic Groups are Respected</h3>
<p>National Socialism is the embodiment of "national will." The racial ideology it holds does not despise other ethnic groups. This kind of thinking is very helpful to world peace. Those who forever discriminate between victorious and defeated countries will never achieve as good results as racial ideology.</p>
<h3>Eliminates Class Struggle</h3>
<p>Hitler then narrated</p>
<p>The achievements of the National Socialist Party in its first year in power, saying that the National Socialist Party's ambition is to gain the trust of the entire nation. Precisely because the whole people trust it, it can break party disputes and eliminate Marxism. We have occupied the premises of various labor unions, but the intention is to oppose class struggle, not to oppose workers.</p>
<h3>Consolidates Religious Belief</h3>
<p>Speaking of religious issues, Hitler said that the various factions of the German Evangelical Church have been merged to form a national church. This is only to consolidate the belief of the Evangelical Church. However, the various churches should also respect the National Socialist state. (Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Monarchy Becomes a Relic of the Past</h3>
<p>Hitler also said, "Recently, an ideal has emerged in the country, saying that the German nation cannot live and work in peace unless it is governed by a traditional monarch. Today, I should protest against this fallacy, because in this year, we have consolidated the authority of the state and the government, so that those who wish to see the old inferior policies return will not be able to achieve their goals. We have considerable respect for the past monarchy, but the question of what kind of political system the country should use to govern is no longer within the scope of discussion today.</p>
<h3>Not for Economic Survival</h3>
<p>Hitler then discussed economic issues. He said that in the past year, the government's subjective policy has been the state, not surviving for the economy, and the economy is certainly not surviving for capital. Both the economy and capital are things that serve the state. (National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Willing to Maintain Friendship with Russia</h3>
<p>When speaking of diplomatic issues, Hitler said that Germany is willing to get along peacefully with all countries,</p>
<p>Regardless of its political system. Therefore, Germany strives to maintain friendly relations with Soviet Russia. However, Germany cannot tolerate communist propaganda in Germany. This is the same as the National Socialist Party not being tolerated in Soviet Russia. (Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Abandons Old Grudges Against Poland</h3>
<p>Hitler also expressed his opinion on the German-Polish peace treaty. He said that even if there are unavoidable disputes between the two countries, it cannot be said that there is no way to reconcile them. Everything depends on human effort. (National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>No Intention of Infringing on Austrian Sovereignty</h3>
<p>Hitler said that the issue between Germany and Austria is a regret for the German government, but claimed that the blame does not lie with Germany. The rumors that Germany is infringing on Austrian sovereignty are unfounded and unverifiable. It can also be seen from this that a broad and fundamental ideology has permeated the entire German nation and cannot be limited by national borders. The people there share the same blood, the same language, and for hundreds of years, their country has been an inseparable part of our country.</p>
<h3>France and Germany Should Join Hands</h3>
<p>Hitler also praised the friendship between Germany and Italy and praised the achievements of Mussolini. Finally, he said that the best result of the dispute over equality of rights is the cooperation between Germany and France. For hundreds of years, the men of the two countries have shed blood on the battlefield from time to time, but ultimately there can be no fundamental change. France is afraid that its borders will not be guaranteed, but who in Germany has threatened it?</p>
<h3>Saar Does Not Need to Vote</h3>
<p>Moreover, after the Saar region is returned to Germany in the future, there will be no more so-called territorial issues between the two countries. Therefore, the Saar region should be returned as soon as possible, so that the atmosphere can be cleared as soon as possible and permanent peace can be established. (National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Mediation is Appreciated</h3>
<p>Hitler continued to say that Britain's willingness to mediate between Germany and France is deeply appreciated. Germany will study the recent proposals put forward by Britain in the long term. Finally, Hitler said that the reason why Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference is because Germany's security and honor cannot be satisfied to the minimum extent through this path. However, the German people are still willing to do their best to cooperate with all nations. Hitler's conclusion was well received, and applause was endless. (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Passed on Third Reading</p>
<h3>Law on Transforming Germany</h3>
<p>Administrative Control of Various States Directly Under the Central Government</p>
<p>Independent Representative System Abolished</p>
<p>(Berlin) This afternoon, the law on transforming Germany, proposed by Interior Minister Frick at a special meeting of the Parliament, was passed on third reading by a unanimous standing vote. It stipulates that the independent representative system of all states in Germany shall be abolished, and the power to control all provinces shall be completely vested in the central government. The parliaments of all states shall be dissolved, and the remaining administrative organs shall be subordinate to the central government in Berlin. Frick, in one fell swoop, placed the chief officials of the various states appointed by Chancellor Hitler last year directly under the control of the central government. The new law will take effect immediately after being passed by the Parliament.</p>
<h3>Britain Slightly Relieves Anxieties</h3>
<p>It is a pity that Hitler's words and deeds do not always match</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday, the speech given by German Chancellor Hitler at the opening of the Parliament has slightly relieved the anxieties of British newspapers. The British newspapers praised Hitler's remarks expressing hope that France would abandon its old grudges. However, it is a pity that Hitler's remarks on Austria were not of a reassuring nature. The Morning Post alone expressed doubts about Hitler's remarks, saying that his words and deeds do not always match, and deeply hoped that Hitler's words were sincere and not just for diplomatic purposes. The Daily News regrets that Hitler did not mention Germany's return to the League of Nations. The Times said that Hitler could carry out policies of internal reform and external reconciliation with greater freedom and power than before. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) There is no shortage of people who praise Hitler's speech, but some people also say that the practical results claimed by Germany are also pleasing to the ear. Germany still has 6 million unemployed people who are living in extreme poverty, and the continued observation of other countries has also aroused many suspicions in Berlin. The newly established German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact is a victory for Hitler, allowing him to prove his desire for peace. However, disarmament is still a matter of speculation, and the activities of the National Socialist Party in Austria are also a very serious problem. The Balkan countries are now watching the dispute between Germany and Austria with deep concern, because Austria's independence is closely related to their economic cooperation and political harmony. Austrian Chancellor Dr. Dolfuss gave a speech yesterday, saying that his struggle is against the wrong world view, and that he is now fighting to defend Christianity and resist heresy. Therefore, there is no doubt that foreign countries still hold a deeply distrustful view of National Socialist Germany. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Solving the Disarmament Problem</p>
<h3>Contents of the Italian Memorandum</h3>
<p>Mainly Through Ordinary Diplomatic Channels</p>
<p>Establish a Convention Between Countries First</p>
<p>Rome The Italian memorandum aimed at solving the disarmament problem was released today. It states that if the situation improves slightly soon, the disarmament problem can be solved separately by all parties. However, in the current environment, it is doubtful whether Germany can reach a compromise without re-arming. Therefore, the problem is how to maintain armaments within the scope of the agreement without allowing them to expand. The Italian government believes that a convention can be established based on conditions that can satisfy the opinions of various countries. The convention must include the following four points: (1) Abolish chemical warfare; (2) Prohibit bombing of civilians; (3) Limit the armaments of countries not bound by treaties to the existing level; (4) Limit the land warfare equipment of countries not bound by treaties to the existing level. As for Germany's request to equip an army of 300,000 men, the Italian government believes that in view of the current state of armaments in various countries, even if Germany's request is allowed, Germany may not be more privileged than the plan proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald. The Italian government also believes that the reorganization of Germany's naval status should be left to the next naval conference for discussion. The Italian government finally expressed its intention to faithfully abide by the Locarno Treaty and stated the necessity of exchanging opinions at present, so that the diplomatic authorities or prime ministers of Western governments can hold a meeting and invite representatives from other relevant countries to participate.

<p>British Memorandum</p>
<h3>No New Suggestions</h3>
<p>Acknowledges German Equality in Armaments</p>
<p>Resolutely Opposes Trial Period</p>
<p>(London) The content of the British memorandum to Germany, France, Belgium, the United States, and Japan yesterday on disarmament has been announced by newspapers. No new suggestions have been seen. The memorandum firmly rejects the idea of a trial period, declaring that Britain, in principle, acknowledges Germany's equality in armaments and suggests that the so-called transitional era should begin immediately. During this era, a compromise plan should be agreed upon for Germany's rearmament and other countries' reduction of armaments. It also suggests that countries should quickly organize international management of armaments affairs. According to the Daily Herald, Britain advocates the demobilization of Germany's stormtroopers and similar organizations. Although the newspaper did not criticize it, it hopes that the British memorandum can help the progress of negotiations. (30th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany Returns British Military Drum</h3>
<p>Booty from the European War</p>
<p>(Berlin) This afternoon, a ceremony was held at the Ministry of the Army to return the military drum of the British Army Gordon Regiment, which was captured near Ostend in 1914, to British Sir Hamilton. The ceremony was very solemn. First, Army Chief Baron von Blomberg gave a speech, expressing admiration for the bravery of the soldiers of both armies. Then, British representative Sir Hamilton gave a reply, briefly stating that he was deeply grateful for President Hindenburg's agreement to return the previously captured military drum. He thanked on behalf of the British military and was particularly grateful for the hospitality of the German Army Chief and the military department. After the ceremony, he immediately proceeded to the Presidential Palace to pay his respects to President Hindenburg. (31st National Dispatch)</p>

<h3>US Shipbuilding Bill Passes House</h3>
<p>Building 102 New Ships in Five Years</p>
<p>Adding 1,184 Naval Aircraft</p>
<p>Maintaining Hegemony in the Pacific</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the House passed Vincent's US Large Navy Plan, a proposal to build 102 new ships, and an amendment to purchase 1,184 naval aircraft. The bill is unlikely to face opposition in the Senate. When Vincent spoke in the House, he said that the US Navy's strength was inferior to that of the Japanese Navy, so the US influence in the Far East was gradually disappearing, and the US was now very isolated in the international community. He also said that the US should pay special attention to the naval conference in 1935, because if it does not make efforts to rectify at this time, the US will lose all naval authority. Britain and Japan are making every effort to expand their naval strength in accordance with the treaty-specified quotas. In the current situation, it is difficult to mobilize the US in the event of an incident. In his speech, Vincent also strongly advocated that the president should have full authority to build new ships and repair all old warships. Congressman Britten was a strong supporter of Vincent's proposal. According to Vincent's proposal, the US must rush to build 65 destroyers, 30 submarines, 6 cruisers, and 1 aircraft carrier. As for the amendment, it is planned to allocate 90 million to add 1,184 naval aircraft. (30th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>Naval Conference Next Year</p>
<h3>Concerns About Discussion of the Far East Issue</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota Aims to Restore National Credit</p>
<p>Arikawa Believes Not Holding a Conference is the Best Option</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Peers reconvened at 1:40 PM. Former Foreign Minister Kozawa Akira took the podium and stated, "I am not here to ask accusatory questions, nor to question past achievements, but to inquire about the government's aspirations. I have heard the speeches of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. It can be said that future policy relies entirely on diplomatic efforts to sweep away thorns and open up difficult situations. However, the future is vast, and difficulties are unavoidable.</p>
<p>Next year is the scheduled date for the naval disarmament conference. If both Japan and the United States follow the intentions of their respective navies and attend the conference, it is conceivable that the conference will inevitably break down. In this situation, optimists say that even if the conference fails, there is no fear of war, nor any competition in shipbuilding. Pessimists, on the other hand, worry about everything. So what should be done? If holding the conference leads to a breakdown, it would be better not to hold it at all. It is more necessary to engage in prior negotiations. Only after negotiations should a decision be made on whether to hold the conference. It would be safer not to hold the conference, as this is not only the case for Japan, but for any opponent, there is no hope of a good outcome from such a conference. Therefore, it is better not to hold it.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is also possible that the Far East issue may be raised at next year's disarmament conference. It was discussed at the Washington Conference, so there is a precedent for this. Regarding this point, the government's aspirations should be decided in advance, as Japan bears the full responsibility for maintaining peace in the Orient. It is not necessary to only discuss the Far East issue. As for the naval issue, Japan should prioritize its own position. If the 5:5:3 ratio is not conducive to maintaining peace in the Far East, then a ratio sufficient to maintain it must be demanded, which goes without saying. Next, regarding the issue between Japan and the Soviet Union, I believe that there are no major issues between Japan and the Soviet Union that cannot be resolved without resorting to war. Japan and the Soviet Union are neighboring countries and have not yet severed diplomatic relations. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Hirota has already stated that he will strive to maintain peace through diplomatic efforts, which I strongly support. If Japan believes that it is impossible to coexist with the Soviet Union's communist system, that is a misguided view. If the Soviet Union is willing to wage war in order to complete the communization of the Orient, that would be extremely reckless.</p>
<p>Regarding the trade issue, I believe that today's situation is by no means a crisis, and a crisis may not even come to pass. Even if it does, diplomatic efforts should be used to overcome the difficult situation. If a third country violates our will, provokes us arbitrarily, and causes war, then decisive measures may be taken. Even at the very end, we must not resort to anything other than peaceful means. This has already been stated by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, which I admire.</p>
<p>Regarding the rise and fall of the world's trust in Japan, I feel that it is related to Manchuria. If Manchuria is established and stable, then Japan's position can be said to shine brightly in the world. Completing the construction of Manchuria will lead to a satisfactory relationship between China and Japan. Fortunately, Manchuria is steadily progressing towards completion. I deeply appreciate the efforts of the government and the military, and hope for even more complete results."</p>
<p>Mr. Kozawa's speech took some time, and he slowly stepped down from the podium. The responses from the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister are as follows. First, Foreign Minister Hirota replied, "It is inconvenient to respond one by one. My feeling is like walking on thin ice. I believe that a war will not occur over the Far East issue, and I now believe that there is no need to worry. At this time, it is necessary to enhance the nation's credit." Prime Minister Saito also gave a simple reply, thanking Mr. Kozawa for his encouragement. The meeting adjourned at 3:05 PM. (United Press, 31st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At today's House of Peers meeting regarding the South Seas Mandate issue, Foreign Minister Hirota, in response to a question from former Foreign Minister Kozawa, replied that he does not adhere to the League of Nations' sovereignty theory, the mandatory power's sovereignty theory, or the Allied Powers' joint sovereignty theory, but insists on basing it on the facts of the Great War, stating that it is Japan's right of possession. This is particularly noteworthy, as when the Allied Powers reached an understanding on the disposition of the former German territories, they decided to place the South Seas Islands under Japan's jurisdiction. Afterwards, at the Paris Peace Conference, the form of mandate was adopted. Therefore, Japan is not necessarily satisfied with the mandate policy, but it does not change the fact of possession. Having understood and accepted this explanation, even though Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, Japan does not lose its right of possession. (Dentsu, 31st)</p>
<h3>Hirota Studies Pro-American and Pro-Russian Policies</h3>
<p>Re-Proposing Arbitration Treaty to the U.S.</p>
<p>Planning to Establish a Demilitarized Zone with Russia</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota, in his response to Ryuuji Nagashima of the Seiyukai at the general budget meeting on the 30th, stated that the government is currently working hard to study effective methods for peaceful relations with the United States and for limiting border defenses between Russia and Manchuria. It is reported that the Foreign Minister is considering the following policies towards the U.S. and Russia:</p>
<h3>Policy Towards the U.S.</h3>
<p>The Foreign Minister intends to have Ambassador Saito, after his appointment as ambassador to the United States, meet with President Roosevelt to explain Japan's peaceful diplomatic policy. If he can obtain President Roosevelt's understanding, he will not hesitate to conclude a Japan-U.S. arbitration treaty in order to implement active peaceful relations.</p>
<h3>Policy Towards Russia</h3>
<p>The Foreign Minister believes that the adjustment of Japan-Russia relations lies in first resolving the outstanding issues between the two countries. Therefore, when the Russian side proposed concluding a non-aggression treaty in the previous year, Japan politely refused. However, the opportunity to renegotiate the China Eastern Railway is near, and the Soviet Union's attitude towards Japan shows signs of softening. The causes of conflict between Japan and Russia within "Manchuria" can also be expected to disappear. In order to maintain peace in the Far East, Japan demands that the Red Army withdraw from the Russian-Manchurian border, expand the spirit of the Treaty of Portsmouth, clearly define the national border between Japan, Manchuria, and Russia, and establish a demilitarized zone within 150 miles of the border to avoid conflict. In order to realize this policy, Japan will propose the establishment of a border commission after the outstanding issues are resolved. (United Press, 31st)</p>

<h3>Currency Bill Becomes Law</h3>
<p>All Cash in the Country Becomes State Property</p>
<p>President Has the Right to Control the Price of Silver</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's currency bill, having been passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, was signed by the President this month. According to this law, all cash and gold coins within the country become state property. The U.S. dollar cannot be exchanged for cash, and the President also has the right to regulate the gold value of the U.S. dollar. The President will now issue multiple orders to regulate the implementation of the currency law, such as setting the value of the U.S. dollar at 60% of the gold value, and establishing an exchange equalization fund of $200 million, which are especially important. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<h3>Promulgation of the Gold Ordinance</h3>
<p>(Washington) The gold ordinance issued by President Roosevelt today allows the Federal Reserve Bank to exchange gold for government gold certificates, in such quantities as the Treasury Department deems necessary to clear international debts and maintain equal purchasing power of various U.S. currencies. The bank may buy gold overseas and within the United States for the above purposes. Gold may be retained or transported or imported or withdrawn or stored in external or internal accounts. Imported gold, if sealed in customs, may be re-exported without a permit; otherwise, a permit is required. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Sterling Cooperation Possible</h3>
<p>(London) Today, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain stated that there is a possibility of cooperation between the British Exchange Equalisation Fund and the U.S. Stabilisation Fund, as Britain is not using this fund to make special changes to the pound. Chamberlain's statement can attract the attention of both Britain and the United States, or secretly conduct negotiations, and can reassure the general public and reduce the degree of future conflict. (National News Agency, 30th)</p>
<h3>Domestic and International Impact</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Currency Act signed by President Roosevelt this afternoon is the most important law in the United States for several generations. This law confirms the reforms that the American financial and economic system has undergone since March 1933, and will have a very significant impact on the internal economic development of the United States and on international monetary and economic relations. The new law defines the new dollar as a non-redeemable currency, and gives the U.S. state ownership of half of the world's cash, that is, all public and private gold reserves in the U.S. The President, according to this law, may freely change the gold content nominally belonging to the currency, that is, the Treasury also becomes a true bank issuing banknotes, and the government may also use a $200 million exchange equalization fund to directly intervene in the financial markets of various countries around the world. Also, since President Roosevelt stopped the gold standard last year, people's hearts have been unsettled, resulting in major confusion in international monetary and commercial relations. Since the promulgation of the new law, this phenomenon has been stopped. However, the dollar price set by the new law is clearly below the price naturally determined by supply and demand in the exchange market, which may inevitably cause a disturbing factor. The U.S. Treasury's intervention in the international gold and exchange markets is sufficient to exacerbate the unequal distribution of cash in the world. From an economic point of view, after the devaluation of the dollar, American export businesses will be excited, and the large number of unemployed people in the United States are eager to find work. For a very long time, they will not demand higher wages according to the new dollar price, which is especially convenient for the U.S. export industry. However, because the United States devalues its currency to develop export trade, it will also reduce import trade because of the devaluation of the currency, because the value of foreign goods is thereby increased. This matter harms foreign countries and is likely to cause international disputes, but in the United States, debtor countries will find this</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>easier to repay interest. The above is in terms of foreign influence. Domestically, private debt, originally calculated in gold dollars, is now repaid in devalued dollars, and all debt is naturally reduced. The beneficiaries and victims are divided into two categories. Farmers trapped by taxes and industrial companies trapped by bond interest are all blessed by the new law. Conversely, the victims are mortgage creditors and those holding public debt. In short, the middle class engaged in savings and laborers who depend on wages for a living are harmed because wages cannot rise with the cost of living. In addition, the new monetary system contains the potential for monetary expansion, especially the potential for lending expansion. The country's economic activity will thereby be strongly stimulated. In addition, the new law can only have the effects described above, both domestically and internationally. (Havas, 30th)</p>

<p>Unreasonable Demands Made by the Japanese Side</p>

<p>The Yutian Mutiny Has Yet to be Resolved</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Since the recovery of the war zone, due to the agreement, it has been impossible to restore order. Ordinary bandits and frustrated elements are taking advantage of this situation to cause disturbances. The various passes of the Great Wall, the gateway to the war zone, although the Japanese side has promised to hand them over, repeated negotiations have been fruitless due to diplomatic changes, and the takeover is indefinite. The Yu Guan takeover negotiations have been deliberately hampered by the Japanese side. Yi Wo, the chief of the Japanese Special Service Agency stationed in Shanhaiguan, has made various unreasonable demands that are difficult for us to accept. The situation has now completely stalled. Progress has been made on the issue of taking over the Gubeikou Pass since Yin Rugeng, the administrative commissioner of Ji-Mi, went to Gubeikou to negotiate with the Japanese military authorities. However, there are still many problems that make it difficult to implement immediately. Furthermore, the Japanese military has built military installations at various important passes. At the same time, the puppet state has set up checkpoints and administrative agencies at various passes. Even if the passes are taken back, they will be nominally controlled. The conflicts between the two sides may arise at any time. A grave mistake has been made, and future troubles are inevitable. The bandits in the war zone have been suppressed in the past, and most of them have been eliminated. However, the remaining bandits are still entrenched in the Jie Lingkou area and can come south to cause trouble at any time. The bandit troops of Li Jichun and Shi Yousan, who were formerly incorporated, have been reorganized into security teams. They have neither gotten rid of their bandit nature nor given up their political motives. They arbitrarily expand their forces and disturb the locality. The authorities can do nothing about it. The recent unrest in Yutian, which has turned into an unprecedented catastrophe, was caused by the security teams that were reorganized from this type of bandit troop. It is found that Shi Yousan previously recruited bandits in Qinhuangdao, intending to cause trouble. After the war zone was taken over, this group of bandits was reorganized into a branch of the security team after repeated negotiations, led by Zhang Futang, and stationed in Yutian. Since this bandit troop was incorporated, on the one hand, it has continued to communicate with Shi Yousan, waiting for an opportunity to act, and on the other hand, it has recruited troops and extorted money arbitrarily to expand its strength. The gentry and wealthy people in Yutian have suffered greatly. In the middle of this month, this bandit troop suddenly recruited 300 bandits from the Tangshan area and opened them up to Yahong Bridge, east of Yutian County, for large-scale extortion. Merchants and residents could not bear the disturbance and fled. The bandits became angry and attacked the town in its entirety on the night of the 19th, looting and burning it. The entire town was looted, and most of the houses were burned to the ground for two days and nights. The Yutian County militia, seeing the town being robbed, united and confronted the bandits. The situation is serious. The authorities are restricted to the war zone and cannot take decisive action against the bandits for the time being. Yin Rugeng, the administrative commissioner of Ji-Mi, has been asked to consult with the headquarters of the 51st Army and the commissioner of the Hebei Provincial Government to find a way to negotiate and avoid further suffering. As a result of the mediation of all parties, the bandits have all retreated to Yutian City. Yahong Bridge is temporarily patrolled by 30 guards from the Commissioner's Office, who are working with the militia to maintain order. All follow-up arrangements will be discussed at length. In recent days, the situation in Yutian and Yahong Bridge has eased. However, the bandits are demanding to be reorganized into a regiment. The authorities are still considering this matter, and the location of the bandit troop's relocation has also become a problem, which may be difficult to resolve properly for a while. In short, the war zone is full of thorns, the problems are complex, and the hidden dangers have not yet been eliminated. (Reached January 28)</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying's Troops Attack Ningxia Provincial Capital</h3>
<p>Main Force Along the Helan Mountains</p>
<p>Besieging the Provincial Capital, Fierce Fighting</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The conflict between Sun Dianying's troops invading the west and Ma Hongkui's troops has lasted for more than ten days. They have successively occupied various towns in Ningbian and penetrated deep into the interior. Although various parties have stopped them, they have not stopped their advance. Sun's attitude is outwardly gentle but inwardly firm. He has repeatedly shown his obedience to the central government and the Beiping authorities. He has repeatedly telegraphed that he has ordered the front-line troops to stop heading west and requested that the Ning army be ordered not to attack again. He has also sent representatives Hu San and Wang Shiping to urge Song Zheyuan and Han Fuqu to mediate for him. In fact, the military operations have not stopped at all. Moreover, his use of troops is unpredictable and purely guerrilla warfare, which makes the Ning army exhausted in dealing with it. Since occupying Dengkou, his cavalry army, Yu Shiming's troops and Yang Hou Shaozi's bandit troops, etc., have gone south along the Yellow River, crossed the river in separate routes, besieged Pingluo, and raided Li Gangbao and Hongshanbao. The main force then secretly marched west from Dengkou, heading south secretly along the Helan Mountains. The area is sparsely populated and transportation is inconvenient. Sun's army went south along the foot of the mountains, marching at night and resting during the day. People and ghosts did not know about it until they approached the Ningxia provincial capital and launched an attack. The Ning army was strained because Pingluo and Li Gangbao were in dire straits, and they tried their best to fight the enemy there. After several days of fierce fighting, they barely held off Sun's army around the 20th, and their formation was slightly boosted. However, on the 26th, Sun's army, Liu Yueting, which had secretly marched from the Helan Mountains, suddenly arrived near the Ningxia provincial capital, occupied the Beita area outside the city, and besieged the provincial capital. At dawn on the 27th, they carried cloud ladders and secretly climbed the city. They were discovered by the Ning army, who fired machine guns from the city and sent troops to intercept their retreat. The fighting was extremely fierce, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. Currently, Sun's troops are still entrenched in Fengdengbao, Beita and other places northwest of Ningyuan, and they are attacking the city from time to time. The situation in Ningyuan is still tense.</p>
<p>The central government has formulated a plan for the conflict between Sun and Ma. On the one hand, it has removed Sun's concurrent post as the director of the Qingxi Reclamation Office to eliminate the idea of Sun's troops heading west and to eliminate the cause of the dispute. On the other hand, it is trying to transfer Sun's troops elsewhere to seek a fundamental solution. The Pingfang authorities, in accordance with the instructions of the central government, are trying to stop the conflict between the two sides and have sent representatives to Taiyuan Guihua to consult with Yan in Jin and Fu in Sui on a solution. However, Yan claimed to be ill, and the representative in Bing has not yet obtained any essential information. He is staying in Bing to await orders. The representative in Sui, Men Bingyue, has gone to Bao and is in contact. There is no news of his return to Ping in the shortest possible time. Wang Shiping, Sun Dianying's representative in Ping, visited He Yingqin yesterday and asked He to send personnel to Dengkou. Wang telegraphed to Sun, inviting him to Dengkou to consult on the issue of ceasing fire and withdrawing troops. He has agreed to Wang's request to send personnel, but as of today, the candidates have not yet been selected. Whether this matter can be realized is still unknown. (Reached January 30)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Eastern Suppression of Red Army Forces Advance Towards Western Fujian</h3>
<p>Going Along the Jiangxi-Fujian Border to Longyan</p>
<p>Jointly Attacking the Red Bandit Base Area</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: At the beginning of the Fujian Mutiny, the Northern Route Army in eastern Jiangxi, in addition to Jiang Dingwen, Wei Lihuang, Zhao Guantao, and other troops advancing south from northern Fujian towards Fuzhou, Wu Qiwu, Zhou Hunyuan, Mao Bingwen and other columns remained in towns and villages at the junction of Jiangxi and Fujian to prevent harassment by bandits and to disrupt the rear. Since Jiang, Wei and other troops recovered Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, the remnants of the 19th Route Army retreated to Longyan, attempting to hold out in a corner. In order to completely resolve the rebellion, the central government ordered the various columns on the Jiangxi-Fujian border to advance south from eastern Jiangxi towards the Fujian border, and to encircle Longyan with the central troops from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. However, Jianning, Taining, Ninghua, Qingliu, Liancheng, Tingzhou and other places on the border between western Fujian and southeastern Jiangxi are all bandit areas, that is, the bases where the puppet 1357 Army Corps recuperated and waited for an opportunity to move during the Fujian Mutiny. The Northern Route Army must carry out a thorough suppression before entering Longyan. Therefore, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, in order to achieve both goals, ordered the Wu, Zhou, and Mao columns to depart from Lichuan to western Fujian in early January. The Huang, Fu, and Huo Divisions advanced to Zhangcun and Hengcun, where Taining and Jianning border Lichuan, on the 21st and engaged in fierce battles with Zhu Mao's various forces. Because of the repeated disastrous defeats in eastern Jiangxi last year, coupled with the exhaustion of supplies, the bandits' spirit was completely lost and they were no longer as stubborn as before. The central army, since the Xun Kou, Xiao Shi, and Xu Du campaigns, had reversed the atmosphere and eliminated the fear of bandits. Therefore, although the bandits had been recuperating for a month, they were still not enough to match the central army's strength. Each division advanced south step by step. After crossing Guangze, Taining, and Jianning, they could then reach Tingzhou and Liancheng to reach Longyan. According to a victory report sent by the forward enemy of the Northern Route Army yesterday, "Fan Songfu, Zhou Hunyuan and other troops engaged in fierce fighting with the puppet 135 Army Corps in Xikou, south of Guangze, on the 27th. As a result, a large number of bandits were killed and thousands of guns were seized. The bandits' strength is indeed diminishing day by day." (January 29)</p>
<h3>Inner Mongolia's Request for Autonomy (Continued)</h3>
<p>Mongols Still Disagree with Central Government's Regulations</p>
<p>The above three stages represent the process by which Minister Huang and the Bailingmiao Autonomy Conference Presidium discussed and agreed on the Mongolian autonomy measures. Now, the most important points of these measures will be explained separately below:</p>
<p>A. Regarding organizational regulations, the aim is to divide the leagues and banners of Xilingol and Chahar into the Mongolian First Autonomous Region, and the leagues of Ulaanchab and Ih Juu, as well as the Tumed, Alxa, and Ejine banners, into the Mongolian Second Autonomous Region. Each region will establish a regional government, directly under the Executive Yuan, to manage the administrative affairs of each league and banner within its respective region. In cases involving provincial affairs, they will consult with the provincial government. A joint office will be established between the autonomous regions to handle common matters. The jurisdiction and governance rights of each league and banner will remain as before. What is added for the Mongols is simply a regional government above the leagues and banners. Its authority is limited to managing the leagues and banners within its region, and each league and banner should still govern its original Mongol population. In cases involving provincial affairs, they must consult with the provincial government. On the one hand, it continues the old system and respects natural conditions, without hindering the provinces and counties. On the other hand, the regional government can supervise the leagues and banners to reorganize administrative affairs and unite to resist foreign aggression.</p>
<p>B. Regarding the regulations for establishing counties, it stipulates that "no more counties or administrative bureaus shall be established within the borders of the Mongolian leagues and banners." Counties are organizations specifically for managing inland immigrants, as detailed previously. Where inland immigrants are densely populated, county administrations have been established. All uncultivated areas, in fact, cannot be cultivated further. The inland merchants and people in uncultivated areas are currently managed by nearby counties, so there is no need to add more county administrations, which would only cause pain to the Mongol banners.</p>
<p>C. Regarding the regulations for land, it stipulates that "all existing wasteland in Mongolia shall be designated as Mongolian pasture areas and never be cultivated. The already cultivated land will be properly reorganized. Before the reorganization, the inherent rights of the Mongol banners over the land, minerals, mountains, forests, rivers, and lakes within their borders will remain as before, and the existing levies will continue to be collected. The existing private rents of Mongolian officials and people will be guaranteed." Most of the existing uncultivated land in Mongolia is desert and cold land, unsuitable for cultivation, and the area is extremely limited. The Mongol people are also our compatriots, and in the period when they cannot be quickly converted to farming, pasturelands should be reserved for them to maintain their livelihoods. Even considering our vast country, there should be adequate pasturelands as a source of camels, horses, cattle, sheep, hides, wool, meat, and dairy products. Therefore, all existing wasteland should be designated as Mongolian pasture areas to develop the local economy through improving animal husbandry and establishing related industries. As for the already cultivated land, the management methods vary from place to place, and disputes between Mongol and Han people frequently arise, which is not good for the local area. Therefore, appropriate measures should be taken to reorganize it. Before the reorganization, all existing rights and interests of the Mongol banners and Mongolian officials and people over the land should be protected.</p>
<p>D. Regarding the regulations for taxes, it stipulates that "all taxes within the pasture areas shall be collected by the autonomous region government according to unified methods detailed by the government. All tax collection bureaus and checkpoints established by the provinces and counties within the pasture areas shall be abolished. The Mongol people shall only bear burdens to the Mongol banners, and the provinces and counties shall not impose additional burdens. The land, mineral, mountain, forest, and river taxes collected by the provinces and counties within the Mongol banner territory, as well as other taxes, shall be jointly collected by personnel dispatched by the autonomous region government, and the proceeds shall be divided equally." Currently, the burdens on the people in uncultivated areas vary greatly. After the establishment of the regional government, methods should be found to standardize them. The tax collection bureaus and checkpoints established by the provinces and counties in uncultivated areas are few in number. To avoid double burdens on the people, they should be abolished. The Mongol people are managed by the Mongol banners and already bear considerable burdens, so the provinces and counties should not impose further burdens, which would overburden the people. In recent years, the central government has stated that education, industry, transportation, and other undertakings in Mongolia are all funded by the central government, but in reality, it is only empty promises. Moreover, it is inappropriate for the local area to completely rely on central government subsidies. The Mongol banners have a precedent for dividing local tax revenues. Therefore, it is proposed to divide half of the local tax revenues collected by the provinces and counties within the Mongol banner territory to build local undertakings with local tax revenues, so that Mongol and Han residents can benefit together. Otherwise, the Mongol banners and Mongol people will always be backward, which is not good for the local area.</p>
<p>The above fourteen items are the most important points of the autonomy measures agreed upon in Bailingmiao, all based on past practices and current factual needs. The Bailingmiao Autonomy Conference initially advocated for unified organization, Mongol-Han cooperation, and a high degree of autonomy, which could not be established. This method of regional and provincial coexistence, division of labor, and cooperation can still be a good strategy to resolve various Mongol border disputes and enable Mongol and Han residents to coexist and prosper.</p>
<p>(3) Key Points and Impact of the Central Political Council's Decision on Autonomy: The eleven articles of the Mongolian autonomy measures decided by the Central Political Council on January 17 contain many points that do not conform to the Mongolian situation. The important points are excerpted from the original text as follows:</p>
<p>1. The scope of the Mongolian Autonomous Region shall be limited to areas without established county administrations.</p>
<p>2. Two districts shall be established in each of Chahar Province and Suiyuan Province.</p>
<p>3. Areas in Chahar and Suiyuan provinces where county administrations have already been established shall belong entirely to the provincial administrative region.</p>
<p>4. The Alxa and Ejine banners, originally under Ningxia Province, shall not be included in the scope of the autonomous region (the above is Article 3 of the measures).</p>
<p>5. The Mongolian Autonomous Region shall adopt a two-level system of districts and banners (Article 4 of the measures).</p>
<p>6. With the approval of the Central Government, the local provincial government may be authorized to handle matters with special characteristics within the Mongolian Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>7. Various Mongolian banner administrations within the Mongolian Autonomous Region shall still be managed by the provincial government under the authorization of the Central Government.</p>
<p>8. All Mongolian banner administrations in areas where county administrations have been established shall be handled by the local provincial government.</p>
<p>9. The Central Government may entrust the provincial government to represent the Central Government and guide the Mongolian regional government in handling local autonomy (the above is Article 7 of the measures).</p>
<p>10. All taxes shall be divided into national taxes and local taxes. Local taxes shall be collected by the provincial government in areas where county administrations have been established and by the autonomous region government in areas where county administrations have not been established (Article 8 of the measures).</p>
<p>11. Mongolian banner areas without cultivation and without county administrations shall primarily engage in animal husbandry, supplemented by farming. People of the Republic of China, regardless of ethnicity, who have resided continuously in this area for more than one year shall have the right to engage in nomadic grazing and cultivation (Article 9 of the measures).</p>
<p>If the above provisions are implemented, the impact will inevitably lead to the following results:</p>
<p>A. The leagues and banners will be eliminated. The situation of the leagues, banners, provinces, and counties has been detailed previously. According to the above-mentioned Articles 1 and 3, "the scope of the autonomous region is limited to areas without established counties, and areas where counties have been established belong entirely to the provincial administrative region." In a broad sense, all areas where the power of the county reaches belong to this category. Therefore, within the two provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, there are arguably no areas without established counties. Where will the autonomous region be established? In a narrow sense, the so-called areas where counties have been established should refer to areas that have been cultivated. In that case, 80 to 90 percent of the Tumed Banner in Chahar, and 50 to 60 percent of the Ulaanchab and Ih Juu leagues have been cultivated. The uncultivated areas are only the scattered places in the Xilingol League, the northern part of the Ulaanchab League, and the Ih Juu League and the Tumed Banner of Chahar. Establishing an autonomous region in these areas means that its area is not as complete as the original area of the leagues and banners. Furthermore, according to the above-mentioned Articles 2 and 5, "two districts shall be established in each of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces" and "the autonomous region shall adopt a two-level system of districts and banners," which means that one league or one banner is an autonomous region, and the leagues and banners have no room for existence. If it is said that they still exist, then the Mongolian side will have a dual organization, which will only increase disputes. According to the above-mentioned Articles 6, 7, and 9, various Mongolian banner administrations within the autonomous region must be subject to the control of the provincial government. Judging from the past situation of provinces and counties encroaching on the Mongol banners, it is inevitable that they will be completely replaced in the future. Such an autonomous region is far inferior to the original leagues and banners. What is the Mongol people's purpose in seeking it? Moreover, the above-mentioned Articles 4 and 8 stipulate that "the two special banners of Alxa and Ejine shall not be included in the scope of autonomy" and "Mongolian banner administrations in areas where counties have been established shall be handled by the local provincial government." Isn't this dividing the Mongolian banners that originally belonged to the leagues or were directly under the Central Government and incorporating them into various provinces? Even Mongolian banners forming a separate system cannot avoid exploitation by provinces and counties. Once they are under the jurisdiction of the provinces, there is no reason for their complete existence. In short, once the autonomy measures decided by the Central Political Council are implemented, the original status, area, and authority of the leagues and banners will be greatly reduced. In the future, they will only disappear and have no hope of prosperity.</p>
<p>B. Pasturelands are shrinking daily. The situation of Mongolian land has been briefly described earlier. Furthermore, in the past, Mongolian pasturelands were vast, so there was no aversion to cultivation. Some even invited inland farmers to cultivate, which proves that the Mongols have never excluded inland immigrants. However, in recent years, cultivated land has become increasingly vast, and pasture areas have shrunk. The Mongol people are also lacking in livelihood skills, leading to difficult livelihoods. This is why they have called for stopping land reclamation and preserving pasturelands. This is a request to the Central Government and the people of the country to reserve a lifeline, with no intention of resisting inland reclamation farmers. This pitiable situation should be understood by all benevolent people. If the above-mentioned Article 11 is followed, "Mongolian banner areas without cultivation shall primarily engage in animal husbandry, supplemented by farming. People of the Republic of China, regardless of ethnicity, who have resided continuously in this area for more than one year shall have the right to engage in nomadic grazing and cultivation," then inland people will inevitably migrate to Mongolian land in large numbers. After residing for one year, they can freely engage in nomadic grazing and cultivation. There are already a considerable number of inland merchants and people residing in Mongolian pasturelands. After the implementation of this measure, if millions more migrate, there will be no place for the Mongol people to produce enough food. The Mongol people cannot change their occupations to farming and industry for the time being, which is impossible in reality. At that time, they will either become bandits or fall into destitution. Regardless of the impact on the border situation, it seems inappropriate in terms of human feelings. This measure, although seemingly beautiful in form by not distinguishing between ethnicities, actually endangers the lives of the Mongol people.</p>
<p>C. Tax revenues are completely lost. The income from uncultivated areas in Mongolia has always been managed by the Mongol banners themselves. The Mongol banners also have various collections and divisions in cultivated areas, as detailed previously. According to the above-mentioned Article 10, "Local taxes shall be collected by the provincial government in areas where county administrations have been established and by the autonomous region government in areas where county administrations have not been established." Then what the regional government collects is only the income that the Mongol banners currently manage themselves. All the income from the Mongol banners in areas where counties have been established will be completely transferred to the provincial government. How will the Mongol banners, which rely on this income to maintain themselves, survive? If it is said that the provincial government can return it to the Mongol banners after collecting it, then based on the past facts of provinces and counties deducting the land rent and land prices that the Mongol banners should have received, it is unbelievable. After this provision is implemented, the Mongol banners will completely lose their tax revenues. Isn't this the opposite of what the Mongol people are seeking?</p>
<p>The above are the inevitable consequences of the implementation of the autonomy measures decided by the Central Political Council, which cannot be resolved by empty words. The Mongol people are seeking improvement but will suffer losses. Even the most foolish people would not dare to accept it.</p>
<p>(4) Request for Remedy: The eleven articles of the Mongolian autonomy measures agreed upon in Bailingmiao have not been approved by the Central Government, and the eleven articles of the Mongolian autonomy measures decided by the Central Political Council contain many points that do not conform to the Mongolian situation. This Mongolian autonomy issue, which concerns the country and the local area, cannot be shelved and ignored. In addition to sending letters and telegrams to the heads of various leagues and banners to request instructions, the representatives can only earnestly request your esteemed office to find a way to remedy it quickly. If you take into account the difficulties of the Mongols and still approve and implement the eleven articles of the autonomy measures agreed upon in Bailingmiao, then the Mongols will sincerely comply and will not fail to live up to the Central Government's good intentions in implementing support. Otherwise, please pay attention to the following three points, formulate appropriate measures, and implement them quickly, which will also benefit the border situation and be fortunate for Mongolia:</p>
<p>1. Please guarantee the original status, area, rights, and interests of the leagues and banners.</p>
<p>2. Please grant each league and banner a unified organization to implement autonomy and jointly resist foreign aggression.</p>
<p>3. Please ensure that each league and banner is forever free from the encroachment and oppression of provinces and counties.</p>
<p>(5) Important Statement: Many people in the country have misunderstandings about the Mongolian request for autonomy and the rejection of the autonomy measures decided by the Central Political Council. Therefore, several points are solemnly stated as follows:</p>
<p>1. The Mongolian request for autonomy is to gather the strength of various leagues and banners to jointly resist foreign aggression and is by no means a separatist movement.</p>
<p>2. The Mongolian request for autonomy seeks the coexistence and prosperity of border ethnic groups and has no intention of excluding inland immigrants.</p>
<p>3. The Mongolian request for autonomy seeks the common security and progress of all Mongols and is not for the benefit of a few individuals.</p>
<p>4. The Mongolian request for autonomy seeks a fair solution to the dual organization of leagues, banners, provinces, and counties and does not oppose the current authorities of provinces and counties.</p>
<p>5. Minister Huang did indeed promise to establish two autonomous region governments and joint offices in Bailingmiao. He also approved to do his best to comply with the cases of stopping land reclamation, pasturelands, and dividing local tax revenues. This can be proved by the thank-you telegrams sent by the heads of various leagues and banners after Minister Huang reviewed and approved them.</p>
<p>6. The autonomy measures decided by the Central Political Council do have the risk of eliminating the original leagues and banners, opening up existing pasturelands, and depriving the Mongol banners of their tax revenues. Therefore, they dare not accept them and are not misunderstanding anything, let alone making trouble unreasonably.</p>
<p>I have carefully examined that the Republic of China has been established for twenty-three years. Mongolia has supported the Central Government consistently, but the Central Government only relies on the provinces, believing that the Mongol people are untrustworthy. Therefore, all plans and propaganda to support Mongolia are equivalent to drawing cakes. Now that Mongolia has been forced to request autonomy, the results are worse than before. Looking to the future, I want to cry but have no tears. Therefore, I dare to lay bare my heart and clearly state my case, respectfully requesting your understanding of my foolish sincerity and a quick remedy. Then the day when Mongolia does not perish will be the year of gratitude. Respectfully submitted to Chairman Lin of the National Government, Representatives Zhao Taibao, Linqin, Suludai, and Jiyatu of the Ulaanchab League in Beijing, Representatives Senggelinqin, Bulintoktokhu, Nasenderleyuer, Baiyincang, and Ayulezhana of the Ih Juu League in Beijing, Representatives Mao Ertesuoer, Gongchongkeluo, and Hasaoqier of the Chahar League in Beijing, Representatives Bayar and Changsen of the Tumed Special Banner in Beijing, Representative Su Baofeng of the Ejine Special Banner in Beijing, Director Wu Heling of the Joint Office of Mongolian Leagues and Banners in Beijing, Deputy Directors Chen Gengyang and Qichangshan, Representatives Dai Qinglian, Wu Yunpeng, He Yongxin, Guan Baojia, Bu Wenlin, and Enhe Amur.

<h3>Armed Clash with Bandits on Songhui Road, Songjiang</h3>
<p>Near Songhui Villa on Songwei Road, last night, Niu Jinggao, deputy squad leader of the Special Service Team of the Songjiang County Public Security Bureau, led four team members on patrol when they suddenly saw shadows in the dark, indicating that people were ambushing there with strange movements. Deputy Squad Leader Niu shouted at them to stop for inspection, but four people dashed out and fled westward. Deputy Squad Leader Niu bravely pursued them. Two people in the rear turned around and opened fire. Niu immediately ordered a counterattack and reported the situation to the Songhui Villa telephone exchange, notifying the military and police agencies to intercept them. For a time, bullets flew everywhere, causing a disturbance all night. The bandits' trail disappeared. It was later learned that two of the resisting bandits had jumped onto the roof of an elderly woman surnamed Liu that day and hid there after jumping down, only leaving at dawn.</p>
<h3>Fellow Townsmen in Beijing Request Permission for Rickshaw Pullers to Own and Operate Their Own Vehicles</h3>
<p>The Songjiang County Government, based on the "Measures for Cracking Down on Rickshaws Soliciting Passengers" proposed by the Sanyou and Hezhong Rickshaw Companies, ordered the bureau to crack down on unauthorized rickshaws. Some argue that most of the unauthorized rickshaw pullers in Songjiang have accumulated capital to own their own vehicles and hire people to register and operate them under the name of "rickshaws." Although this may be slightly non-compliant in terms of administrative management, the rickshaw pullers also have the hardship of avoiding heavy rentals and seeking self-reliance. If the measures proposed by the rickshaw companies are hastily implemented, it will not only affect the livelihoods of the unauthorized rickshaw pullers, but also suppress the self-reliance of laborers and block the tendency for rickshaw pullers to own their own vehicles, which is inconsistent with the principles of the Kuomintang. Therefore, the original situation should be considered and methods should be devised to manage and support them. At the county party and government meeting on January 17, it was proposed that "in addition to the two rickshaw companies, a certain number of rickshaws in the city should be allowed to be owned and operated by rickshaw pullers with licenses." At that time, the county government only decided that "the county government will investigate the case and submit it to the province for instructions." It is now learned that fellow townsmen Pu, Gao, Xu, and Lu in Beijing are also very sympathetic to the proposal at this party and government meeting. Therefore, they have jointly submitted a petition to the provincial authorities, ordering the county to determine the number of rickshaws and allow rickshaw pullers to own and operate their own vehicles with licenses.</p>
<h3>Suzhou's Population Has More Men Than Women</h3>
<p>The Wu County recently completed its population census. Yesterday (31st), the Public Security Bureau reported to the county government that there are a total of 72,703 households in the urban area of Suzhou, with a total population of 192,136 men and 144,341 women, a difference of 47,795 more men than women.</p>
<h3>Thieves Involved in Robbery Cases in Shanghai Escorted Back to Face Justice</h3>
<p>The thieves involved in the robbery cases at No. 301 on Shanhai Pass Road, No. 247 on Fujian Road, and the Xifu clothing store next to the Yong'an Company near the Xinza Road intersection in Shanghai were arrested by the Huangdai Public Security 9th Sub-bureau in Jinshan Village. Xu A'gen was already escorted back to Shanghai by the Xinza Concession Police last month. Later, the Huangdai 9th Sub-bureau received a notice from the Xinza Concession Police that Xu's accomplices were also coming to Huangdai. The sub-bureau immediately dispatched police to pay attention. The day before yesterday (30th), two people came from Wangting to Xu A'gen's home in Huangdai and were arrested. They confessed that one was Zhou A'mao and the other was Sun Shaobing, and that they had come to Xu's house to retrieve a handgun. They were handed over to the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday (31st), the Shanghai Special District 1 Court sent a document and dispatched personnel to Suzhou to escort Zhou and Sun back to face justice.</p>
<h3>Fire Burns to Death</h3>
<p>The house of Xie Shuisheng, a villager of Gao Jingcai in the Shanren Bridge District, was burned down the night before last due to carelessness in using fire for warmth. Xie and his wife, Liu, were severely burned. Their six-year-old son, Ruijin, did not manage to escape and was burned to death. When the body was exhumed, the face was unrecognizable, and the hands and feet were burned off, like a piece of charred wood. Yesterday (31st), the procurator of the local court went to inspect the scene and then the body was collected.</p>
<h3>Extortion and Fraud in Wuxi Result in Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Chen Leigong and Su Wencai, who were from out of town, extorted 20 silver dollars from Shi Hu, the wife of the owner of the Wan Chengyu South-North Goods Store outside the South Gate, under the pretext of reporting a smuggling case. Shi Hu twisted Chen into the Public Security 1st Sub-bureau, reported it to the General Bureau, and transferred him to the County Court for trial and detention. Su Wencai was also arrested and detained by the court and prosecuted together. Judge Lai has repeatedly held court hearings, and the debate has concluded in the case. It is now learned that yesterday was the date for sentencing in this case. Judge Lai ordered Chen and Su to be brought to court. Chen Leigong and Su Zhicai were each sentenced to two years and eight months of imprisonment for extortion and fraud. After the sentence, they were ordered to be returned to custody to await the expiration of the appeal period before being sent to prison.</p>
<h3>Surveying of the Circular Lake Road Begins</h3>
<p>The construction of the Circular Lake Road in this county is a cooperative effort between the government and local people. The county government is responsible for the road construction project, while the bridge and embankment projects are funded by local fundraising. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu believes that the construction of this road will not only enhance the scenic beauty of the lake and mountains, but also revitalize the city. Therefore, he especially went to the province to meet Chairman Chen last month and personally reported the construction plan. Chairman Chen greatly praised it. After County Magistrate Yan returned to Wuxi, he immediately ordered the Technical Office to draft a budget, deciding that the cost of the road earthwork and foundation project was 7,000 yuan, and the cost of acquiring privately owned land was 5,000 yuan, which was included in the budget and submitted to the department for approval. He also used 250 yuan of surveying funds and sent engineers from the Technical Office, such as Jin Xinjing, to hire boats and bring surveyors, setting off yesterday (31st) to survey from Binjie Mountain, passing through Yuantouzhu, Zhongdu Mountain, Wanqingtang, and then to Guanshe Mountain, Qitang, Chongshan, and other places. The estimated survey period is more than two weeks. In the future, it is planned to build a long embankment from the foot of Binjie Mountain to the opposite bank, with bridges in the middle, and to build a long bridge from Yuantouzhu to Zhongdu Mountain and from Zhongdu Mountain to Wanqingtang. However, it is estimated that each bridge will require at least 50,000 yuan in construction costs. It is also heard that County Magistrate Yan believes that the Xian-Chun and Tong-Yang roads are the only way to reach the urban area from the Circular Lake Road, but these two roads are too narrow. Therefore, he has specially ordered the third and fourth district chiefs to be responsible for widening each of these two roads by two meters to facilitate traffic.</p>
<h3>Major Fire at the City God Archway in Hangzhou Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>At 1:50 AM yesterday (31st), a fire broke out at the Chunji Sock Factory at No. 17 City God Archway Street in Hangzhou due to carelessness in using the stove to dry shoes. Due to the cold weather, the reporting of the incident by the on-duty police was slightly delayed, leading to a conflagration. The fire was unstoppable. The fire brigade rushed to the scene with various foreign-style fire engines to put out the fire. It took about three hours to extinguish it. Those affected were awakened from their sleep, and the cries of the old and young were extremely miserable. Moreover, many of the items snatched out were stolen by thieves. According to a subsequent investigation, a total of 15 shops and houses were burned down, with losses of more than 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Land Bureau</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Recently, I read in your newspaper a news item stating that land bureaus would be established in seven counties, including Shanghai's Baoshan, Kunshan, Wujiang, Rugao, Changshu, and Songjiang, starting on March 1st. This is completely untrue. There is no establishment of land bureaus in these seven counties. This must be a rumor. I am sending this letter to correct the record. I hope you will publish it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Secretariat of the Jiangsu Provincial Land Bureau</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Arrives in Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi and His Wife Arrive by Train and Get Off at Zhenru</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, Yang Yongtai, and Others Welcome Him at the Station</p>
<p>Chiang to Go to Hangzhou This Morning and Then to Fuzhou</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission, who previously flew from Fujian to Nanjing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, will personally inspect the aftermath of the Fujian incident as soon as possible. He arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing at 5 PM yesterday, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Soong Mei-ling, and Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and his wife. The train was originally scheduled to arrive at 11:50 PM last night, but due to a train delay, it did not arrive at Zhenru Station until 12:20 AM this morning. Chairman Chiang and the Kongs got off at Zhenru Station and went straight back to their residence by car to rest. Last night, the Zhenru Station was guarded by the security team. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the General Headquarters Yang Yongtai, Director of the Security Department Yang Hu, and Director of the Public Security Bureau Wen Hongen all personally went to the station to welcome him. Chiang was wearing a black wool cloak and a gray wool hat, and his face seemed a little thinner, probably due to overwork. After getting off the train, he frequently nodded and smiled at the welcoming staff and then went back to his residence by car to rest. According to Mayor Wu, Chairman Chiang will go to Hangzhou this morning and, after a short stay, will probably go to Fujian to handle all the follow-up issues.</p>
<h3>T.V. Soong Returns to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Meet with Reporters at 10 AM This Morning</p>
<p>To Report on the Direction of the National Economic Council's Progress</p>
<p>T.V. Soong, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Council, who previously went to Nanjing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee and the Third Plenary Session of the National Economic Council, returned to Shanghai by night train from Nanjing at 7:10 AM yesterday. He got off at Zhenru Station and went straight back to his private residence on Qiqi Road to rest. Those who came to Shanghai on the same train included Shao Lizi, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, Chen Bulei, Director of the Education Department, Vice Minister of Finance Zou Lin, and Director of the Customs Administration Shen Shuyu, among others. Due to the fatigue of the journey, T.V. Soong rested at his residence yesterday and did not see any guests. He is scheduled to meet with reporters at the office of the National Economic Council on Xiafei Road at 10 AM this morning to report on the direction of the National Economic Council's progress decided at the Third Plenary Session.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Goes to Hangzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Departs by Car at 9:30 AM This Morning</p>
<p>A Short Sightseeing Trip Before Returning in a Few Days</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang, former Chairman of the Beiping Military Branch Council, went to Hangzhou by car at 9:30 AM yesterday after returning to Shanghai from Nanjing to meet with Chairman Chiang and to sightsee along the way. He is expected to return in three to five days. It has been internally decided by the central government to announce Zhang's future position soon. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Yesterday Morning's Trip to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:30 AM, Mr. Zhang departed from his residence on Route Moliere in his private car. He traveled via Route Qiqi, passed the Jinji Bridge, and took the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway directly to Hangzhou. The Municipal Security Bureau specially dispatched a team to provide protection along the way. At the same time, the Director of the Municipal Security Bureau, Yang Hu, also drove to see him off, returning only after reaching Longhua Road. Those accompanying Mr. Zhang to Hangzhou yesterday morning included Tang Guozhen, his guard captain Tan Hai, and several guards.</p>
<h3>Assignment Decided</h3>
<p>Regarding Mr. Zhang's future assignment, according to information obtained by reporters yesterday from sources close to Mr. Zhang, the central government has already internally decided on Mr. Zhang's assignment, and a formal announcement is expected in the near future. It is likely to be the previously rumored position of Deputy Commander of Bandit Suppression for Five Provinces. However, there are also rumors of him becoming the President of the Military Advisory Council, though the former seems more reliable. Furthermore, after Mr. Zhang returned to Shanghai from Nanjing, he did not discuss his assignment with old friends in Shanghai, presumably because the central government had not yet made an announcement, and he was therefore not in a position to express anything himself.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation's Newly Purchased Aircraft Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's No. 16 Sikorsky aircraft, used for the Shanghai-Guangdong air route, encountered an accident near Dongqishan, close to Zhapu, leaving only the No. 17 aircraft to fly back and forth on the Shanghai-Guangdong route. Therefore, they purchased a new twin-engine aircraft from the Sikorsky factory in the United States, which was loaded onto the "Peter Maersk" cargo ship of the Andersen Meyer trading company and transported to Shanghai. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 2:30 PM yesterday, berthing at the Gonghexiang Wharf. The company had already reported the import of the new aircraft to the Jianghai Customs the day before. The cargo will be picked up today (the 1st), transported to Longhua Airport, assembled, and test-flown.</p>
<h3>Economic Cooperation Movement</h3>
<p>(Begins Today)</p>
<p>Purpose: To explain the meaning of economic cooperation</p>
<p>Mission: To arouse the attention of society</p>
<p>In recent years, rural areas have gone bankrupt, industry is sluggish, and people's livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult. Crisis looms, and the situation is unimaginable. The China Economic Credit Cooperative, recognizing this, is implementing economic cooperation as a means of self-help and mutual assistance. This allows members to save a small amount of money each month, providing appropriate relief and security from business operations and consumption to entertainment, from unemployment and illness to old age, and from children's education to family finances after death. Therefore, it directly protects the lives of individuals and indirectly promotes the welfare of society, which may well be a good way to solve national economic problems. However, the term "economic cooperation" is not well understood by society. Therefore, the cooperative proposed to launch an economic cooperation movement for two months starting from February 1st of this year, to explain the main purpose of economic cooperation on the one hand, and to gather opinions and benefits on the other. It has gained the sympathy of all sectors. Participating organizations include the Ministry of Industry, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Municipal Social Bureau, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, etc. On the central government side, there are Chairman Lin, President Wang, Secretary-General Chu, Minister Kong, Minister Chen, Minister Zhu, etc. In Shanghai, there are Mayor Wu, Secretary-General Yu, Director Wu, Director Pan, Director Wen, Director Cai, etc. Leaders in Shanghai, such as Zhang Gongquan, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, and Wang Xiaolai, all support and participate, in order to arouse the attention of society.</p>
<p>This economic cooperation movement focuses on written publicity and theoretical elaboration. During the period of the movement, special supplements will be published in major newspapers, in which experts and celebrities will be invited to write articles, and contributions from all walks of life will be welcome. The cooperative's economic cooperation is based on cooperative methods to improve the inherent defects of the existing economic system and achieve the goal of mutual assistance. This is because the current economic system, with capitalism as its focus, takes free competition as the principle in all aspects of production, distribution, transaction, and consumption, which leads to unequal wealth, unequal distribution, unequal transactions, unequal production, and unequal consumption. In short, it is inequality of survival. This not only makes the poor feel pain but also adversely affects the rich. Economic cooperation aims to break this contradiction, so that wealth can be used properly to promote the comfort of our lives and bring society into a realm of mutual assistance.</p>
<h3>New System of Weights and Measures to be Implemented Starting Today</h3>
<p>Announcements issued by the Social Bureau and Jianghai Customs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, in order to promote the new system and abolish the old system, has issued a notice to all merchants and residents of the city, requiring them to comply with the regulations and implement the new system starting from the first day of this month. The Deputy Commissioner of Customs of the General Affairs Department of the Jianghai Customs also issued a notice yesterday stating that, starting from today, import and export goods will be calculated using the new system of weights and measures, and the equivalent number in the old system of weights and measures must also be indicated. The two announcements are copied below.</p>
<h3>Announcement by the Social Bureau</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau issued Announcement No. 615 yesterday, stating: "The purpose of weights and measures is to provide accurate information about items. Standardizing instruments and processes will ensure uniformity across the region, facilitating daily use. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it has actively engaged in construction, promulgating laws and regulations and promoting the new system. This bureau was ordered to handle this matter and, with the approval of the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce, designated July 1st of the 20th year [of the Republic] as the deadline for completing the standardization of weights and measures in this city. Numerous earnest announcements have been issued, and the Municipal Weights and Measures Inspection Office has dispatched personnel to conduct inspections. Now that the deadline has long passed, while many businesses have adopted the new system of weights and measures, there are still many who have delayed making changes, using the failure of customs, tax, and salt administrations to implement the new system in advance as an excuse. The Ministry of Finance issued Instruction No. 8683 in July of last year, instructing its subordinate agencies to comply with the new system by February 1st of the 23rd year at the latest. It then re-emphasized this instruction to all subordinate agencies with Secret Order No. 1697 on December 27th. Now that customs, tax, and salt administrations have complied with the new instruments within the specified time limit, there is no longer any question. All businesses still using the old instruments should immediately comply and switch to the new system to uphold the laws. Anyone who dares to deliberately violate this will be dealt with according to the law without leniency once discovered. In addition to ordering the Municipal Weights and Measures Inspection Office to intensify its efforts, this announcement is hereby issued, ordering all merchants and residents of the city to comply without fail. Take heed."</p>
<h3>Announcement by the Jianghai Customs</h3>
<p>The General Affairs Department of the Jianghai Customs issued a notice regarding the implementation of the new system of weights and measures, requiring temporary indication of the equivalent number in the old system of weights and measures. The notice stated: "The new system of weights and measures is scheduled to be implemented on February 1st of this year. This customs has already issued Announcement No. 1328. Starting from the date of implementation of the new system of weights and measures, for three weeks, for goods transported from domestic ports, the waybill must clearly indicate the new system of weights and measures and the equivalent number in the old system of weights and measures separately. All merchants are required to comply. This announcement is hereby issued. Zhou Ji, Deputy Commissioner of Customs, General Affairs Department."</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai Urges Sun Dianying by Telegram</p>
<h3>Obey the Central Government and Withdraw from Ningxia</h3>
<p>The Western Border is Now Devastated</p>
<p>It is Inadvisable to Disrupt the Overall Situation with Military Force</p>
<p>Since the conflict between Sun Dianying and the Ma forces in Ningxia, the situation has gradually become serious. It is learned that Sun Dianying telegraphed Wang Xiaolai and others yesterday, stating that he had been ordered to move to Suiyuan but was attacked by the Ma army, requesting instructions on whether to advance or retreat. Wang replied with a telegram of advice yesterday. The exchange of telegrams is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying's Telegram</h3>
<p>(Omitted above) After resisting Japan in Rehe, we withdrew to the border of Chahar. Then, due to the Chahar Incident, we were ordered to move to Suiyuan and cultivate the land in Qingxi. After the order was issued, we prepared to travel west, hoping to find a way to serve the country and have the opportunity to serve. However, because of my lack of virtue, I was not understood by the Ningxia and Qinghai authorities, which led to their severe rejection. The mission of my army is only to cultivate the land, and to use cultivation to strengthen border defense. I have no ambition to seize territory, and I have never seized territory in the past. However, the Ningxia and Qinghai authorities immediately used this as an excuse to oppose us, raising the banner of resistance and rejecting us outside the border. The central government seeks compromise, but the parties involved do not realize their mistake. As a result, for several days, I have stopped the army from advancing, wandering in Baotou and Suiyuan, with tens of thousands of soldiers gathered in the desolate area. In addition, our clothes are thin and supplies are scarce. During this severe winter, soldiers' fingers and feet are frozen, and we hear about it every day. Sitting in the sand, they often speak bitterly. Seeing this, I am heartbroken and have no words to comfort them. They rely on each other in hunger and cold, with both love and pain. At this time, if we want to follow the order and travel west, we will face the enemy's attack. It is impossible to live in the wilderness. It is difficult to advance or retreat. Before, I consulted with Mr. Yan Xishan and asked to open up a fertile area to temporarily avoid the cold and wait for spring to travel west, for the country and for the army, to alleviate the current crisis and pacify the people. Now, according to the original plan, I have ordered them to pack and move on schedule. The opposition still says that my actions are related to Fujian and that there are bad elements in my army, slandering and making groundless accusations, which is heartbreaking to hear. If I were not willing to commit suicide, I would not abandon the country. Seeking perfection only invites destruction, and falsely accusing others misleads the country. I only hope that the Ningxia and Qinghai authorities will understand my plight and allow me to pass through the border. This will not only be a blessing for all officers and soldiers of my army, but also a blessing for the country. But now it is not the case. When my army was traveling, the Ningxia authorities launched a light cavalry attack. My unprepared troops suffered a sudden attack, and we could not avoid it, causing heavy casualties. The Ningxia authorities have spread many rumors and turned against me. Now, they are sending troops from Gansu and Qinghai directly to Ningxia. What is their intention? It is unthinkable. Sir, you are deeply patriotic and have always cared for me. What crime have I committed? I cannot understand. In this difficult situation, I dare to speak frankly. How should I act? I ask for your guidance. Sun Kuiyuan, Ma Yin.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai's Reply Telegram</h3>
<p>To Commander Sun, please forward from the 41st Army's Office in Nanjing: I have received the Ma telegram. In the Rehe battle, you showed your hard work. After that, in Chahar, you retreated far away. These two battles earned you respect. Later, you were ordered to enter Qinghai, but the large number of troops became a burden, leading to suspicion from neighboring forces. Learning from the past, you should think about how to remedy the situation. I hope that you will strictly abide by the establishment, reduce redundant troops, obey the central government, and withdraw from Ningxia. Then public opinion will consistently be sympathetic, and the country will not be willing to abandon you. The western border is now devastated, and there are repeated alarms from Shule. As a general, you should not meet with military force, which would disrupt the overall situation. Anyone who holds military power and is in a precarious situation is not easy to deal with. Even with Zeng Guofan's qualifications and prestige, when he supervised the Jiangxi army as a vice minister, he was still envied by the governor of Jiangxi. Not to mention others. Therefore, you should not blame others for this, but should seek the solution within yourself. I think it is enough to support your army with the allocated funds, allowing them to be well-fed and well-equipped, and store them for national use. In the past, Kou Xun saw Jia Fu avoid him, and historians did not blame him for his cowardice, but praised him for understanding the overall situation. All these historical precedents can be used as lessons. In recent times, the problem is that there is little friendship between friends who give advice and dissuade from wrongdoing, and much intrigue. This is only enough to mislead you, not to love you. Because I have known you for a long time and cherish the meaning of encouraging soldiers, I dare to offer sincere advice. I hope you will understand. Wang Xiaolai.</p>
<h3>The Rice Industry in Northern Shanghai Resumed Operations Yesterday Afternoon After Persuasion</h3>
<p>Party and Government Organs Issue Joint Announcement</p>
<p>One Seriously Injured Worker Died from His Injuries</p>
<p>A Post-Mortem Examination Will Be Conducted Today, and a Criminal Lawsuit Will Be Filed</p>
<p>The rice industry laborers and shoulder carriers in Northern Shanghai had a brawl two days ago due to competition for work, injuring 18 people and leading to a strike in the rice industry. Yesterday morning, various businesses continued the strike. In the afternoon, the party and government organs issued a joint announcement persuading them to resume work. A seriously injured worker, Leng Shanlin, died from his injuries yesterday. The Social Bureau ordered the rice industry to review the register of unemployed workers. The rice industry issued an appeal. The details of each item are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Continued Strike</h3>
<p>More than 30 rice shops, including Wanshengtai, Hengkang, Yutai Xing, Zhicheng, Fengtai, Tongxinggong, Huada, Xinchang, Xiechangde, Suifeng, Wantai Xiang, Yusheng, Dayouheng, Hefengtai, Changfengyi, Ruichangfa, Wanyuanhe, Yuchangxiang, Hengdaxin, Qingshengyi, Dachangrun, Yicheng, Hongchang, Damao, Yongshengtai, Juxingcheng, Rentaisan, and Yudade, Yuanfeng, along the Suzhou River bank near Xinzha Bridge and Wuzhen Road Bridge, continued to strike yesterday morning after shoulder carriers repeatedly caused trouble since the day before.</p>
<h3>Joint Announcement</h3>
<p>The Social Bureau and the Public Security Bureau issued a joint announcement yesterday stating: "Regarding the conflict between shoulder carriers and rickshaw pullers in the Zhabei rice market, this bureau and the municipal party department have sent personnel to convene both parties for questioning and decided that all existing foremen at the Zhabei rice market docks will be abolished. The rice shops and factories will freely hire foremen, give them fixed wages, and must not extract any fees from the workers' wages, in order to fundamentally improve the situation and eliminate disputes forever. The permit of Shi Dengfu, the head of the shoulder carriers, has been revoked and canceled by this Public Security Bureau. The Municipal Social Bureau has begun to investigate the issue of unemployed workers at the rice market docks and will arrange for the rice shops and factories to provide employment separately. This announcement is hereby issued, ordering all workers to be informed, remain calm, await instructions, and refrain from causing further disturbances. Take heed."</p>
<h3>Persuading to Open the Market</h3>
<p>Fearing that they would still be obstructed by workers from the Hongshou Yuji shoulder carrying company after opening the market, the rice shops in Northern Shanghai convened an emergency meeting of representatives from various shops at the Shanghai Office of the Soybean and Rice Industry Association on Kulun Road at 11 AM yesterday to discuss how to respond. More than 70 people attended the meeting, which was chaired by Lu Jingwen. After discussion, it was decided to persuade the shops to resume work first. At noon, Jiang Shizhi and Lu Jingwen from the rice industry, along with Tan Kai from the Special Task Force of the Public Security Bureau and Mao, a staff member from the 4th District Public Security Bureau, went door-to-door to persuade the shops to open the market.</p>
<h3>Protecting Business Operations</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau also dispatched more than 30 police officers from the First Squadron of the Police Brigade and 20 armed police officers from the Fourth District Office, together with security guards dispatched by the defense corps, to protect business operations along the river. After the shops opened the market, the rickshaw pullers, fearing that they would be harmed by the shoulder carriers on the way, requested the Public Security Bureau to forward the request to the patrol to protect the rice carts passing by at any time. Fortunately, no incident occurred.</p>
<h3>Association Notice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association and the Rice Grain Sales Industry Association issued a joint notice yesterday stating: "We, the undersigned, were forced to suspend business due to the disturbance of the rice market by Shi Dengfu and other workers of the Hongtai Yuji company, and waited for the government to resolve the matter. Now, Mao, a staff member from the Fourth District, and Tan, the captain of the police brigade, have come in person on the orders of Director Wen to earnestly persuade us to resume business and promise to be responsible for protection. Considering that rice is a matter of public concern, and since the Public Security Bureau is responsible for protection, the market should be opened and business resumed. We hope that all fellow merchants will take note."</p>
<h3>Death from Injuries</h3>
<p>During the fight between rickshaw pullers and shoulder carriers the day before, Leng Shanlin and Xu Songlin were seriously injured. Yesterday, Leng Shanlin died from his serious injuries at the Second Hospital of the Red Cross. (It was also rumored that Xu Songlin died at the same time, but the workers denied it.) The other 16 people who were slightly injured have reported their injuries to the local court and will file a criminal lawsuit based on the law. The court will conduct a post-mortem examination of the deceased today.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Appeal</h3>
<p>The Soybean and Rice Industry Association, the Rice Milling Industry Association, and the Rice Grain Sales Industry Association issued an appeal yesterday stating: "It is now reported by various rice shops and rice factories in Northern Shanghai that they have been repeatedly disturbed, intimidated, and threatened by Shi Dengfu and others, interfering with business operations, freely occupying the rice trucks and rickshaws hired by the shops and factories. When their desires are not met, they declare that they will resort to unfavorable means. They have been disrupted several times, resulting in a de facto market shutdown. Now, they are intensifying their actions, creating a dangerous situation. With no other choice, we have to suspend business and await orders. Upon investigation, Shi Dengfu and others, who are the main culprits in disturbing the rice market, falsely established the Hongtai Yuji shoulder carrying company and secretly obtained a license from the Public Security Bureau. Shi Dengfu, claiming to be the head of the shoulder carriers on the Suzhou River, gathered hundreds of unknown people, flaunting and threatening, and surrounding the Xinzha rice market, obstructing rice transportation. Fellow merchants have repeatedly petitioned the municipal party department, the municipal government, the Social Bureau, and the Public Security Bureau, requesting that they be stopped. However, Shi Dengfu and others have been rampant and unlawful, and they have intensified their actions. All fellow merchants have been forced to suspend business, which is indeed the case. We, the undersigned, believe that the country is in serious trouble and that food is important to the people. We have repeatedly endured the disturbances caused by Shi Dengfu and others and have persuaded our fellow merchants to remain calm and wait for the government to resolve the matter. Now, we are in an extremely dangerous situation and unable to protect ourselves. We have no choice but to suspend business and appeal, awaiting the authorities to resolve the matter. We sincerely hope that all sectors, all industries, and all organizations will show sympathy and provide assistance. We are extremely anxious. Sincerely."</p>
<h3>Sixth Batch of American Wheat Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>One Ship Unloaded in Shanghai</p>
<p>One Ship Transferred to Nanjing</p>
<p>The sixth shipment of wheat purchased from the United States under the loan agreement has arrived from the United States. Among them, the "Maolandi" ship, carrying more than 5,700 tons, has arrived in Shanghai and is being unloaded. The "Nofuo" ship, carrying more than 7,000 tons, is delivering to Nanjing. Therefore, after arriving in Shanghai, it will transfer to Ningbo for unloading. The seventh batch of wheat also has two ships, which are already on the way and will arrive soon. The total amount of American wheat is 260,000 tons. Since the start of shipping, a quarter of the goods have arrived in this port. Currently, the market price in Shanghai is about 70 yuan per ton of American wheat. Import duties are waived, making it much cheaper than the price for flour mills that directly import from overseas to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Current Locations of Prominent Figures</h3>

<h3>An Aircraft Crashed in Hongqiao the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Trainee Named Chen Died on the Spot</p>
<p>Li Jingcong Denies It Was an Eurasia Aircraft</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday, an aircraft crashed in Hongqiao, killing a trainee named Chen. At the time, there were four trainees being instructed by foreigners on the field. It was said that trainee Chen took off first and had just reached about 120 feet in the air when the engine suddenly stalled, and the aircraft fell to the ground with the person. Chen died on the spot, and the aircraft was completely destroyed. A steel pillar on the aircraft penetrated Chen's chest and abdomen. The flying helmet he was wearing could not be removed due to the brain matter splattering out. As for which organization the aircraft belonged to, the reporter inquired at the Eurasia Company yesterday. He met with Li Jingcong, the manager of the company, who said that he knew nothing about this incident and that it was probably an aircraft from other military organizations. When the reporter inquired about which military organization it belonged to, he said that he did not know, so there was no way to find out the details. It was later learned that the name of the so-called trainee Chen was only known in Western characters as C.C. Chen. The central government and his family have been notified, and the central government has provided 5,000 yuan in compensation to handle his funeral.</p>
<p>International Wireless Telegraph Bureau</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Reception for the Press</h3>
<p>Director Wen Reported at the Dinner</p>

<p>The Citizen's Association is Launching</p>
<h3>A Rent Reduction Movement</h3>
<p>Reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Please Participate Together</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizen's Association replied to a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "We have received your letter (the original letter was published in the newspaper on January 27, omitted), etc. After the second regular meeting of our association, it was unanimously agreed that our association has received numerous letters from citizens from all walks of life, who have been unable to bear the pressure of rent due to the impact of the Shanghai Incident and requested assistance in reducing rent. The situation is urgent. Therefore, we have invited all groups in the city to jointly organize a rent reduction committee to comprehensively plan and alleviate the suffering of citizens. In this time of economic depression and market decline, citizens, especially merchants, bear a greater burden of rent and suffer greater losses due to their business. If we do not actively remedy the situation as soon as possible, it would be contrary to the meaning of revitalizing Shanghai. Moreover, law is inseparable from human sentiment, and economics is related to the foundation of the country. Individual self-preservation is a limited strategy. The mass movement is the responsibility that every citizen should bear. As for the so-called landlords and tenants, we should consider both sides, avoid difficulties for both parties, and handle matters fairly, which should be reviewed and approved by the Municipal Government. Our association not only completely agrees with this, but also sincerely hopes that we can make landlords realize the necessity of mutual assistance and make the municipal government aware of the need to reduce rent. If we do not plan concrete and effective ways to start, it will not be enough to achieve the final goal of fair handling. Your association leads merchants and benefits society. In order to protect the market, you must sympathize with our cause. Therefore, we reiterate our previous proposal, and ask you to quickly send representatives to participate in the rent reduction committee to maintain the overall situation. We also hope that you will send all the documents of this advice to the landlords and tenants and the petition to the Municipal Government to handle the matter properly to the association for reference. We correspond to this in order to maintain the overall situation and in order to hope you will comply and reply accordingly."</p>

<p>Resolving Problems Inappropriately in Guangdong</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Supplementary Treaty Signed Regarding the Wusong Ship Case</h3>
<p>Settled by the Seamen's Preparatory Committee and Butterfield &amp; Swire Company</p>
<p>The Chinese Version of the Agreement is the Legal Basis for Both Parties</p>
<p>The Seven Articles are Comprehensive and Satisfactory in Content</p>
<p>The tragic case of the Butterfield &amp; Swire Company's Wusong ship, in which workers were dismissed and injured, has dragged on for almost a year. Although a resolution was announced in Guangzhou last November, the contents of the agreement were riddled with errors and were unsatisfactory to the workers. The most heartbreaking and disappointing aspects were: first, the number of workers to be reinstated was not clearly specified; second, non-reinstated workers would only receive a subsidy of 25 yuan each; third, no worker representatives participated in the signing of the agreement; and fourth, the recall registration process, awaiting reorganization, disregarded the union's position and the workers' welfare. After a year of heavy sacrifice, such an outcome not only ignored the interests of the workers but also set a bad precedent, damaging the long-term labor movement and national vitality, and playing into the hands of imperialism. Upon hearing this, people from all walks of life were indignant, especially the workers on the ship who were directly affected. They appealed to the Chinese Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee to uphold justice and resolve this dire situation. The committee also considered the handling of the case in Guangzhou to be inappropriate and shared the same indignation. Based on the workers' request and their own sense of duty, the committee dispatched secretaries Hou Dachun and Sun Lupi in early December to strongly argue with the company. However, Butterfield &amp; Swire adopted a tough stance, initially refusing to negotiate, then claiming that the matter had already been resolved by a seamen's organization in Guangzhou, and finally resorting to threats, expressing their willingness to suspend shipping operations. Nevertheless, the union's determination remained firm, vowing not to rest until the goal of improvement was achieved. The key points raised by the union for correction included: (1) specifying the number of workers to be reinstated as 35 to 40; (2) increasing the subsidy for non-reinstated workers to 30 yuan; (3) resolving the problem of reorganizing the middle-class crew should involve the union's participation; and (4) recognizing the union's right to recommend and oversee dismissals, etc. For two months, secretaries Hou and Sun, disregarding all obstacles and difficulties, bravely moved forward, continuing to negotiate with Butterfield &amp; Swire more than a dozen times, appealing to reason and pointing out the benefits and drawbacks. Their painstaking efforts were admirable. Only in recent days did the company gradually concede. Finally, the day before yesterday, the two sides' opinions had approached, and it was decided to supplement the existing conditions. Butterfield &amp; Swire not only accepted all the points raised by the union headquarters but also expressed sincere admiration for the union's spirit of serving the public good. At the same time, out of respect for China's national dignity, they agreed to use the Chinese version of the treaty as the legal basis, which is rarely seen when signing treaties with foreigners. This supplementary treaty was signed at Butterfield &amp; Swire at 4 p.m. yesterday. The union convened an emergency meeting in the morning and appointed Zhang Jianbai as the signing representative and Sun Lupi as the witness. On the worker side, Wang Oumin was appointed as the witness and Jiang Genggui as the representative. The company was represented by White and witnessed by Yuan Lupi. With this, the dispute was fundamentally resolved. All workers who should be reinstated reportedly boarded the ship last night. The various treaty provisions are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Treaty Signed in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>(1) If Butterfield &amp; Swire can prove the survival and well-being of the missing worker Gao Kunquan, the issue of compensation will be waived. This evidence must be submitted to the witness within two weeks. (2) Butterfield &amp; Swire will recall all 126 dismissed stewards from the Wusong ship from the date of signing, register them in the worker roster, and pay them salaries as before, with the same terms as the original workers, within one month. Butterfield &amp; Swire will reorganize the stewards on the Wusong ship. After the reorganization, in addition to those who remain on the ship, each surplus worker will be paid a subsidy of 25 yuan. (3) All workers on the Guangzhou-Foshan ship, as well as the coolies, stevedores and workers on all small vessels at the Butterfield &amp; Swire warehouse in Guangzhou, will be reinstated as before. (4) After the signing of these conditions, Butterfield &amp; Swire agrees to restore the previous favorable treatment to worker merchants, and the Seamen's Union agrees to cancel the strike. The Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce agrees to persuade merchants to resume trading with Butterfield &amp; Swire and will no longer demand compensation for all losses incurred during the strike period.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Supplementary Treaty</h3>
<p>Regarding the Wusong ship dispute, Butterfield &amp; Swire is willing to sign a supplementary treaty with the Chinese Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Seamen's Union) as follows: (1) Articles 1, 3, and 4 of the original treaty signed in Guangdong will be maintained. (2) Article 2 of the original treaty signed in Guangdong is supplemented as follows: (a) The number of original Wusong ship workers remaining on the ship is fixed at 35 to 40. (b) The subsidy for each surplus worker, except those remaining on the ship, is changed to 30 yuan. This amount will be paid by the company to the union for distribution. (c) Non-reinstated workers should be given priority when the company's ships need workers. (3) The issue of reorganizing the entire middle-class crew will be resolved through long-term consultation between the Shanghai Shipping Trade Association and the Seamen's Union. (4) Butterfield &amp; Swire agrees that there will be no more instances of armed eviction of workers. (5) Butterfield &amp; Swire agrees to consider accepting workers recommended by the Seamen's Union and agrees not to dismiss workers without legitimate reasons. (6) This treaty is based on the Chinese text. (7) This treaty shall take effect from the date of signing. Furthermore, it is reported that the workers are now very happy with the swift resolution and the satisfactory content of the treaty and will petition the Preparatory Committee to hold a general meeting on a regular basis to celebrate.</p>
<p>The Yellow River is in Flood</p>
<h3>The Hebei Yellow River Disaster Relief Association Pleads for Emergency Relief</h3>
<p>More than 100 Villages in Two Districts Have Been Completely Submerged</p>
<p>Disaster Victims are Without Food or Clothing, Their Cries Fill the Wilderness</p>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Association for Raising Emergency Relief for the Yellow River Flood, received a letter yesterday from the Hebei Provincial Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, stating that a sudden thaw had caused a catastrophic flood in Changyuan County in the province. Successive reports from the county government and the Bureau of Public Works indicated the disaster was severe, and they pleaded for a quick allocation of funds to provide relief and save the people. The original letter and telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Letter from the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association</h3>
<p>Respected Sirs: We have recently received successive telegrams from Changyuan County Magistrate Bu Hengxun, Investigation Committee members Zhang Qin and Yang Shulin, and Yellow River Conservancy Bureau Director Sun Qingze, reporting that a sudden thaw in Changyuan County in this province has caused a steep rise in the water level. Ice floes were carried out of the breach and flooded over one hundred villages in the second and fifth districts of the county. The water depth on the plains is three to four feet, and everything has been submerged. The old and young have drowned, their bodies lying everywhere. Those who escaped are without food or clothing, their cries fill the wilderness, a truly unbearable scene. We earnestly request a quick allocation of emergency relief to save the victims. Accordingly, we have learned that the recent flooding in Changyuan County in this province, caused by the Yellow River's rising water and sudden thaw, has caused the victims to suffer great hardship. In this severe winter, the suffering is truly unprecedented. In addition to sending members of this association to distribute emergency relief and telegraphing the central headquarters and the Disaster Relief Group for investigation and relief efforts, the matter concerns saving lives, and we have always admired your association's great concern for the disaster situation in this province. We are sending you a copy of the original telegrams and request that you investigate and provide generous assistance and relief efforts, for which we will be eternally grateful.</p>
<h3>Telegram from Changyuan County</h3>
<p>To the Hebei Provincial Government Yellow River Flood Relief Committee in Tianjin: The water disaster in Changyuan this time is most tragic. We are deeply grateful for your repeated dispatch of personnel to provide relief and assistance to the people. Unexpectedly, while the investigation and relief efforts were underway, a sudden surge of ice floes occurred on January 13th, causing the water level to rise sharply, completely submerging over one hundred villages in the second and fifth districts. The water depth on the plains is varying from three to five feet. With the harshness of the severe winter, the old and young drowned, their bodies lying everywhere. The young and strong who escaped were without food or clothing, their cries filling the wilderness, a truly unbearable scene. Those who have come to the city in search of a meal or a place to live number in the hundreds. It has not been long, but more and more are coming. Those who linger on the east bank of the river, crying and wailing on the levee, are countless. The cause of this ice floe flood is that the breach at Shitou Village has not been blocked. Downstream from Shitou Village to Gaoping in Hua County, the water is scattered and shallow, the riverbed is unstable, and the flow is slow. It has completely frozen over. The sudden rush from above was blocked, leading to widespread flooding without any end in sight. In short, if the breach is not blocked for a day, the victims will not have a way out for a day. If this period is delayed any further, the people will sink further into misery and decline, and who knows what the consequences will be. In addition to the county quickly taking measures to provide relief, we are sending this telegram to report and hope that you will quickly send emergency relief to save the flood victims who have been repeatedly affected in this area, and urge you to quickly block the breach to prevent future disasters. We would be most grateful. Signed, Acting Changyuan County Magistrate Bu Hengxun, Acting Secretary Pang Yuanshu, Investigation Committee Members Zhang Qin and Yang Shulin, Yellow River Flood Relief Committee Deputy Chairman Sun Tingrui.</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Bureau of Public Works</h3>
<p>To the Hebei Provincial Disaster Relief Committee: The ice flood has risen one meter in the past two days. Outside the main dyke, the water has already reached the dyke roots. The villages have once again been submerged in deep water. Piles of ice floes are being carried wildly by the currents. There are few boats and the roads are blocked, making escape impossible. The victims will either die in the water or freeze to death. The treetops and rooftops are converging towards the dyke. There is no way to provide rescue. We have seen the village walls of Tielu Village surrounded by water. The terrain inside the village is higher than outside by over ten feet, but even though we are trying to block the water, we fear we cannot protect it to the end. The situation is dire. The victims are kneeling on the dyke, crying and begging for help, unable to speak. The scene is extremely tragic. In addition to requesting the Industry and Relief Group to detain the large boats at the breach and quickly release them into the disaster area, we have also sent personnel to the disaster area overnight to provide relief. However, the accumulation of ice floes makes travel difficult, and the flood area is wide. Please send a special commissioner to rescue the remaining people as soon as possible, and please send the original telegram to the newspapers, asking them to join forces in appealing. We are anxiously awaiting orders with tears and urgency. Signed, Member Sun Qingze, bowing.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhizhong Leaves for Europe for Investigation</h3>
<p>Sailing This Morning</p>
<p>Gu Zhizhong, head of the Shanghai reporter's investigation group to Sichuan and Kangding, set out with group members at the beginning of last month to investigate Sichuan and Kangding. He needed to go to Europe and America for investigation at the beginning of this month, so after arriving in Hankou, he said goodbye to the group members and first took a plane to Chengdu for contact. The members then continued along the planned route, going up the Three Gorges, and have safely arrived in Chongqing. Gu returned east to Shanghai by plane after contacting in Chengdu, arriving in Shanghai on January 27, and took a boat to Europe this morning to investigate politics, economics, education, and journalism in various countries. The students of the Minqia News College, founded by Gu, held a banquet for Gu last night and decided to go to the port this morning to see him off. Gu is currently a reporter for the "Xinwen Bao." When the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army was underway, he was a war correspondent and went north with the army. After the Jinan Incident, he went to Jinan with Chinese and foreign journalists in Shanghai to investigate. After the September 18th Incident, Gu went to Dalian, Shenyang, and other places three days later to investigate the tragic situation at that time. In the spring of the year before last, he also joined the League of Nations investigation team and entered the Northeast, writing "The Great Appeal of the Northeast." In the autumn, he also participated in the Shaanxi investigation group initiated by the Longhai Railway, writing "A Journey to the West." Last year, he organized the Qinghai investigation group and went to Qinghai to investigate the people's livelihood and industrial situation, writing the book "Go to Qinghai."</p>
<h3>The Puppet State Refuses Powell Entry</h3>
<p>Because He Propagates Anti-Japanese and Anti-Manchu Sentiment</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily" reports that Powell, editor and publisher of the "Millard's Review" and correspondent for the "Chicago Tribune," arrived in Kobe yesterday from Dalian and is currently en route to Tokyo. He is expected to return to Shanghai in about two weeks. Powell left Shanghai on January 13 to visit Puyi's enthronement ceremony, but unexpectedly, on the same day, the puppet Manchukuo Foreign Ministry ordered the Dalian Passport Office to refuse Powell entry into Manchukuo because Powell was still engaged in anti-Japanese and anti-Manchu propaganda in his magazine and in his correspondence with the "China Press." Therefore, Powell had no choice but to turn back and go to Japan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Nationals Pay Attention to the Shanghai Municipal Council Election</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council election will be held next month. The composition of the next council is gradually attracting the attention of the general public. Chairman Fessenden is about to take leave and return to his home country, and it is expected that he will not be willing to run for re-election. However, it is reported that the other four British members of the council, namely Mr. Arnhold (Deputy Chairman), Major General Macnaghten, Mr. Massey, and Mr. Harris, are all willing to be candidates again. As for the American council member, Mr. Raven, he will also return to the United States and will not be able to be re-elected this year. Therefore, the American candidates are rumored to be Franklin and Carlisle. The Japanese council members, Mr. Funatsu and Mr. Okamoto, are still considered candidates. The question of who will be the next Chairman is now a widely discussed topic. According to Japanese newspapers, Japanese taxpayers are now engaging in activities to promote Mr. Funatsu of the Japan Cotton Spinners' Association as the Chairman of the Municipal Council, saying that Mr. Funatsu has served as the Japanese Consul General in many places in China and is the General Manager of the Japan Cotton Spinners' Association. His knowledge and ability are well known, and he has extensive connections and holds considerable influence among Chinese and foreigners. As the "Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun" says, the presence of Mr. Funatsu and Mr. Okamoto on the Municipal Council is sufficient to maintain the prestige of Japanese residents in the concession. In any case, it is reasonable that the position of member of the next Municipal Council should belong to them. The newspaper also said that, according to custom, the Chairman is elected by the council members, and in the past this position was exclusively held by the British (the "North China Daily News" notes that this statement needs to be corrected, because since 1911, Americans have held this position for seven years). The time has come to abolish this privileged right that is unsuitable for the times and give this position to the right person, regardless of nationality. From the current situation, if Mr. Arnhold is re-elected, he can be expected to be elected as Chairman as the Deputy Chairman. Powerful figures among the Japanese residents also do not quite agree with the Japanese newspaper's proposition, as the Chairman may have to go to the Bureau every day to work, while Mr. Funatsu has a specialized job and has to leave Shanghai frequently. If he is the Chairman, it would be very inconvenient.</p>
<p>The Trade Bureau Prepares</p>
<h3>Opinions on the Export of Cattle and Beef</h3>
<p>Establishing Farmers' Loan Offices to Develop Animal Husbandry</p>
<p>Inviting Experts to Guide Farmers in Improving Animal Husbandry</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau previously received a letter from the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry, requesting an investigation into the export of cattle and beef from our country and the preparation of opinions. Director He immediately ordered the Guidance Department to conduct an investigation and prepare a plan after receiving the letter. It is understood that the Guidance Department has prepared a plan and sent a letter to the Commercial Department for reference. The opinions on the export of cattle and beef are as follows:</p>
<h3>Loans to Farmers</h3>
<p>(1) In recent years, the rural areas have been depressed, and farmers lack capital. If they borrow money from private individuals, the interest rates are too high, and the cost of raising cattle is relatively large. If they do not have enough ability, it will be difficult to raise cattle. To make rural finance active, local officials should allocate funds, or local wealthy people should raise funds to establish farmers' loan offices, lending to farmers at low interest rates, to be repaid when they produce. This will give farmers capital and enable them to develop animal husbandry and increase production.</p>
<h3>Preventing Cattle Diseases</h3>
<p>(2) There is a lack of veterinarians in the countryside. If there is cattle plague or other diseases, farmers can only sit and wait for death. The cost of raising cattle is large, and the life and death of cattle is of great importance to farmers. Therefore, to prevent cattle diseases, local government offices must send veterinarians to the cattle-raising areas for inspection, or establish small-scale veterinary hospitals to diagnose and treat cattle diseases, in order to develop animal husbandry.</p>
<h3>Organizing Cooperatives</h3>
<p>(3) Cattle are traded by cattle merchants who buy from farmers and resell to cattle markets, and then the cattle markets resell to exporters. This indirect trade involves several transfers from the cattle raiser to the exporter, and the middleman's exploitation is high. Moreover, cattle merchants often monopolize prices, and cattle merchants deliberately suppress prices to make profits, causing farmers to suffer a great loss. To avoid unfair trading, local government offices can convene cattle-raising farmers to organize sales cooperatives for joint sales, which is both convenient and economical.</p>
<h3>Improving Animal Husbandry</h3>
<p>(4) Our country's animal husbandry methods are outdated and do not know how to improve. There is no research on cattle feed and cattle barns. As a result, countless lean and sick cattle die. Local government offices should hire experts to guide farmers to improve animal husbandry using scientific methods, so as to ensure that vegetable cattle are fat and plowing cattle are strong, in order to increase cattle production. (5) In recent years, there have been more and more ranches in various places, but there are too few animal husbandry talents and veterinarians. In the future, schools should be established to train specialized talents in this field in order to improve and develop animal husbandry.</p>
<h3>Smallpox is Prevalent in This City</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau Provides Free Vaccination</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau has recently received successive reports from various parties that smallpox is very prevalent in the city. After dispatching medical personnel to investigate, it was confirmed to be true. Currently, active efforts are continuing to promote free vaccination in order to eradicate the disease. Any citizens who wish to be vaccinated can go to the bureau's affiliated clinics or hospital agencies for vaccination, free of charge. If a family with smallpox is discovered, a report can be made to the Health Bureau by phone. However, on Saturday afternoons, Sundays, and other holidays, only the number 449 is available for calls. (In the concession, dial 46280, in the Chinese area, dial 422 to 438 and then transfer to 449. The telephone numbers of other offices will not be answered.) The addresses of the bureau's affiliated clinics are listed below: South City Health Office, LinYin Road, South City (telephone South City 23355); South City Clinic, Penglai Road, South City (South City 22401); Zhabei Office, Minli Road, Zhabei (Zhabei 41967); Jiangwan Health Office, Jiangwan (Jiangwan No. 62); Wusong Health Office, Wusong WaiMa Road (Wusong No. 15); Gaoqiao Health Office, Gaoqiao Town.</p>
<h3>The Jincheng Grand Theatre Opens Today</h3>
<p>The long-awaited film palace, Jincheng Grand Theatre, is scheduled to hold its opening ceremony at 2 p.m. today, exclusively inviting guests from all walks of life. At the same time, Mayor Wu is respectfully invited to open the theatre. It is sure to be a grand occasion. A brief description of the theatre's interior is provided below.</p>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>The entire building adopts a three-dimensional style, with magnificent and towering features, reaching the clouds. The posture is solemn and the atmosphere is all-encompassing. The entrance hall is circular, with wide staircases on both sides. The interior is also spacious, clean and simple.</p>
<h3>Decoration</h3>
<p>The facade has five giant glass pillars, as high as 54 feet, unparalleled at the time, with a heroic and radiant appearance, extremely magnificent. Once the lights are lit, green light radiates in all directions, dazzling and eye-catching, competing with the Chinese and English signs to create a beautiful effect. The staircases in the corridors are also decorated with neon lights, reflecting the interior and exterior, creating a spectacular view. The main entrance has a Forbidden City-style window, matched with scientific colors, making the light even more charming and soft. The lighting arrangement in the auditorium is unique, with hidden lights, elegant and pleasing. All the railings are made of high-quality aluminum, pure and lovely. The corridors are paved with high-quality carpets, in light red and light green, adding to the beauty. The wall decorations are simple and eye-catching, without any smoky atmosphere. Both sides of the stage are decorated with glass pillars, which are exceptionally magnificent.</p>
<h3>Facilities</h3>
<p>The entire theatre is equipped with thoroughly modern facilities. The heating system is the latest type. The heater is not an ordinary hot water radiator, but a special new type of equipment that transports hot air into the theatre. It is equipped with an automatic mechanism that can freely control the hot air and extract the polluted air, maintaining a moderate temperature and making the entire theatre feel like spring. As for the air conditioner, it uses pure scientific methods to create cold air and introduce it into the theatre. This cold air can also be freely increased or decreased, adjusting according to the climate outside the theatre based on hygiene standards. There are more than 1,800 seats, with more than 1,100 downstairs, 700 in the balcony, and 170 in the gallery. All the upstairs and downstairs seats have spring cushions, which are extremely comfortable. The style, size, and arrangement of the seats were carefully considered, researched for many months, and revised seven or eight times before being completed. As for the moderation of height and the spaciousness of position, these are other matters. The sound system installed is the latest German real-sound giant machine, with clear and beautiful sound, neither sharp nor turbid. All the noise and echoes are blocked by the non-combustible soundproofing paper covering the walls. The projector is the German Annaman No. 5, with strong light, and the objects projected on the screen are clear and distinct, near and far. As for the size of the screen, it can be said to be the largest in China.</p>
<h3>General Meeting of Tenants in Yuxing Lane, French Concession</h3>
<p>The houses in Yuxing Lane on Rue Pére Robert, French Concession, have been rebuilt since last year and were completed in November. There are more than 40 buildings in total. The landlord is the Dahua Silver Company, which manages the rental. Most of the tenants have moved in. It is reported that the tenants find the rent set by the landlord to be very expensive and cannot afford it. They have requested a rent reduction once, but the landlord has refused. In order to deal with the situation collectively, the tenants convened a general meeting of all tenants at the Municipal Assembly Hall at 3 p.m. yesterday to discuss the countermeasures. Huang Yunong was elected as the chairman. The following resolutions were unanimously adopted: (1) Organize a Yuxing Lane branch of the Municipal Assembly Hall. Huang Yunong, Xu Yujiu, Liu Chengfang, Bian Dazhi, and Li Weiqin were elected as directors, with Huang Yunong as the general director, responsible for handling negotiations. (2) The rent in this lane is more expensive than any newly built neighborhood. Request a 40% reduction in rent to be fair. (3) Send letters to the Municipal General Assembly and various organizations for unified assistance. (4) Before a resolution is reached, rent payments will be temporarily suspended and all funds will be kept in the bank. (5) Investigate the evidence of small rent payments made by each tenant and send a letter to the landlord to negotiate for reimbursement. (6) Hire a lawyer as a legal advisor. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

In order to promote planting in all sectors, the society is offering a limited number of seedlings. Those who are interested in planting pyrethrum and need good seedlings can go to the society's agency at 1157 Henan Road, Shanghai, before February 20 to pay and pre-order. In addition, the society, in view of the large number of requesters over the years and the frequent shortage of seedlings, and in order to promote cooperation among farms in various places, those who have purchased seeds from the society in the past and have surplus seedlings and are willing to sell them can also contact the society for purchase in order to adjust the needs of various places.</p>
<p>Art Show Ticket Revenue</p>
<h3>To Relieve the Dependents of Li Du's Troops</h3>
<p>General Li Du led his troops in battles for more than a year when the Shenyang Incident occurred. His hard work and high achievements are admired by all. Currently, his troops are stationed outside the Great Wall, while his dependents are stranded in Shanghai, suffering from hunger and cold. Since the Relief Association stopped providing assistance, they have relied entirely on General Li's personal support. However, his resources are limited and unsustainable. Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Huang Jinrong, and others in this city have initiated an invitation to famous amateur opera performers and stars to hold an art show at the Tianchan Stage for one day on the 5th of this month. Each ticket is priced at two yuan, and all proceeds will be used for relief. Yesterday, letters were sent to all sectors urging them to buy tickets enthusiastically in order to accumulate small amounts to make a large sum.</p>

<p>Reporters' Group Visited Yesterday</p>
<h3>Wuzhou Pharmaceutical's New Factory</h3>
<p>Producing High-Quality Glycerin</p>
<p>Well-Equipped with Machinery, with Great Prospects</p>
<p>The Wuzhou Soap Factory, established by the Wuzhou Pharmacy in this city, is the largest soap and pharmaceutical factory in our country. The factory is located in Xujiahui, Shanghai West. Recently, the company has expanded the second pharmaceutical factory on Anhe Temple Road in the Western District, using soap-making waste to refine glycerin. It began refining on New Year's Day this year and produces high-quality products. Yesterday afternoon, reporters from various newspapers were invited to visit the two factories. At noon, a banquet was held at the Huaan Building, reporting on the factory's preparation process. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Report on the Process</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Wuzhou Pharmacy hosted a reception for reporters at the Hua'an Building on Jing'an Temple Road. More than twenty reporters from various newspapers attended. During the reception, Gao Hanqing, Lu Zhixue (both managing directors), and Xiang Shengwu (general manager) of the company successively reported, stating that the Wuzhou Pharmacy had been established for a long time. After the European War, they purchased machinery from Germany to manufacture Guben Soap. Although they faced competition from the Shanghai Soap Company, which had substantial capital, they eventually gained public trust due to the excellent quality of their products. Therefore, their business had been doing well in recent years. However, during soap production, the waste liquid used to wash the lime in the soap originally was considered waste. The company decided to use chemical methods to refine this liquid to extract glycerol in order to reduce costs. At that time, Mr. Zhang Fuzhong was sent to Germany to study. After seven years of research, he returned to China last year and is now in charge of the glycerol plant. The machinery is also of German origin, model 1931, and is the most advanced machinery in East Asia. It can produce two tons of pure glycerol per day. The annual demand in China is approximately five million to ten million tons. Currently, the plant's annual production is only five to six hundred thousand tons. If the Chinese people can compete to buy the product, the plant can be further expanded to increase production. After the meal, the company provided transportation for the reporters to visit both plants. The new plant covers an area of about ten mu, and the old plant covers an area of more than thirty mu. The equipment is exceptionally complete. The reporters were very impressed with the company's large-scale equipment in promoting domestic goods. The observations are summarized below.</p>
<h3>Wuzhou Second Pharmaceutical Factory</h3>
<h3>Uses of Glycerol</h3>
<p>Glycerol was discovered 190 years ago by the Swedish pharmacist Scheele. Initially, due to poor manufacturing methods, it was only used to flavor wine and medicine. Since 1867, after Nobel used nitroglycerin to make explosives, glycerol has been valued worldwide. This is because explosives are not only destructive tools for conquering cities and killing people, but are also necessary for creating modern civilization by opening mines and roads. Recently, it has been widely used in cosmetics, food, textiles, printing, and the tobacco industry. Glycerol is used in winter airships and cars to prevent freezing. The scope of application is therefore expanding daily. However, no one in China has manufactured it until now. Recognizing this, the company purchased the latest German machinery and hired the expert technician Mr. Zhang Fuzhong to use the waste liquid from the Guben Soap factory to manufacture glycerol. After more than a year of operation, production began on New Year's Day this year. The quality of the glycerol produced surpasses imported products.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Equipment</h3>
<p>The company's soap and pharmaceutical products have excellent results and are sold throughout the country. Especially household soap, which is of pure quality and durable, surpassing all others, so it has the most reputable. However, the raw materials used, such as tallow and vegetable tallow, are all domestically produced. Compared with other companies that use inferior raw materials to make soap, the cost is several times higher. In order to reduce soap manufacturing costs, the company decided to refine the waste material secreted during soap making into refined glycerol using chemical methods.</p>
<h3>A Corner of the Glycerol Factory</h3>
<h3>Mechanical Equipment</h3>
<p>The layout of the factory is completely modern. The brine is stored in the cellar. When in use, it is pumped into a very large iron barrel by a suction machine. After chemical cleaning, it is transferred to a storage tank on the upper floor of the building, allowing it to flow down naturally and be filtered. Chemical reagents are then used to remove impurities. The resulting clean liquid is concentrated using vacuum evaporation equipment. The equipment is a double-effect type, with various attachments. The resulting crude glycerol is distilled under vacuum. The structure of the equipment is quite complex. The vacuum pumps used for evaporation and distillation are dry type and of great shape. After decolorization, it becomes white glycerol. There are two boilers for heat, a large one for tube boiler, and a small one for circulating high-pressure steam boiler. The condensed water is still returned to this boiler, so a lot of heat is saved. The power is electricity, and a square shed is self-built to convert into various potentials and distribute it to all parts. The water source is taken from artesian wells, and the suction pump, water pool, and tower are connected with automatic motor switches. All pipes in the factory have color codes. The location of the storage tanks, suction machines, and various switches are all considered for work efficiency. It is truly a model chemical plant in Shanghai. The factory covers an area of ten mu. In addition to the glycerol manufacturing section, it is planned to attach an injection needle factory, using the latest method, to manufacture various injectable medicines. The location is quiet and the air is clean, making it very suitable for manufacturing high-quality medicines. It is expected that the company's injectable medicine will be a brilliant addition to the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<h3>Five People Killed and Injured in a Car Accident</h3>
<p>Yesterday at about 3:00 PM, on the east side of the Fourth Bridge on Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, about ten feet away, a truck carrying building materials, license number 12399, rental number 10776, traveling from east to west, suddenly swerved north to the side of the road and crashed into five pedestrians, all of whom were seriously injured. Among them, a young woman and a man had their heads crushed by the wheels and died immediately. Later, Li Fengchao, a patrol officer from the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, and Zhu Gui, a member of a volunteer defense team, noticed the accident and reported it to Yue Junling, the police officer stationed at the Tanziwan branch, who then reported it to the chief of the station, Xu Yuanlin. Chief of police Wang Junjie was sent to the scene to investigate and found the report to be true. The injured people, along with the driver, were taken into custody and escorted to the Fourth District. District officer Zheng Zuhan saw that the injured people were seriously injured and immediately sent them to Shilong Hospital for treatment in an ambulance. Among them, two men and women with lighter injuries were bandaged by the doctor and discharged from the hospital immediately. Two people with more serious injuries remained in the hospital for treatment. Later, the father of one of the deceased filed a report, stating that his name was Yuan Zhiyuan, 52 years old, from Yancheng, and lived in a thatched shed at the Fourth Bridge on Zhongshan Road, making a living by running a pancake shop. His son (the deceased) was named Li Luo, 26 years old, and specialized in guarding cotton boats. He unfortunately died in a car accident today and requested relief. He also said that the two people in the hospital were Zhou Futian, 31 years old, from Funing, living in Zhujiawan, and Guo Yunchang, 29 years old, from Yancheng. The lightly injured man and woman were Cai Ziming, 47 years old, from Shanghai, living in Zhujiaqiao, farming for a living, and Jiang Su, 19 years old, also from Yancheng. Both claimed that the car did not honk its horn, resulting in the crash. Later, the driver of the car, named Yang Zhaoqing, 26 years old, from Haimen, confessed that he was carrying building bridge materials, which were too heavy, causing him to be unable to avoid the accident. After questioning the confession, the interrogating officer believed that the driver was too careless and ordered him to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for disposition. The body of the deceased Yuan Li Luo was temporarily placed under the custody of Zhang Fengqi, the land guard of the 23rd district, pending a report to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy today. It was learned that among the four injured, Guo Yunchang suffered injuries to the waist, back, and lower body, which were the most dangerous, posing a threat to life, and was unable to speak. Zhou Futian suffered injuries to the left half of his body, which were also extremely dangerous. Cai Ziming suffered injuries to the head, face, feet, etc., with blood dripping. Jiang Su suffered injuries to the chest and was unable to stand. Later, Yuan Zhiyuan, the father of the deceased, claimed that he had three sons, the deceased son being the eldest. There were two other sons, one thirteen years old and one only ten years old, who all depended on the deceased Li Luo for their livelihood.</p>
<p>Forging Documents from the Funing County Government</p>
<h3>Exposure of Moving Arrested Kidnappers</h3>
<p>The Official Document Format is Incoherent and Illogical</p>
<p>After Interrogation, the Words were Evasive and Ambiguous</p>
<p>The Result is That They Were All Escorted Back to Funing for Trial</p>
<p>The notorious kidnapper Sun Zijin, a native of Funing, had repeatedly committed major kidnapping and ransom cases in his hometown. When the case was exposed, he fled to Shanghai. The Shanghai Local Court arrested and detained the suspect and sent a letter to the Funing County Government, requesting them to send police to escort him back. After the official letter was sent, Fan Changzhu, a native of Funing, suddenly delivered a document from the Funing County Government to the Local Court, requesting that the kidnapper Sun Zijin be handed over to him to be taken back to Funing for investigation. The receiving and dispatching office observed that the document had the words "Personally to be opened by the Director of the Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office" written on it, which was incoherent and illogical, causing immediate suspicion. They reported it to the Chief Prosecutor for instructions, who immediately sent personnel to interrogate Fan Changzhu. His words were evasive and ambiguous. In an unusual coincidence, the Funing County Government happened to send another official document for another case. When the document submitted by Fan Changzhu was compared, the size of the County Government's seal was inconsistent. It was then discovered that he had forged the County Government's seal, fabricated official documents, and attempted to deceive, which was extremely audacious. He was ordered to be taken into custody pending instructions. A reply was sent to the County Government, requesting them to send appropriate personnel to Shanghai to escort the suspect. Yesterday morning, County Chief Li prepared a document instructing four political police officers, Yin Jinfang, Li Guoliang, Wang Mingsheng, and Du Chunbai, to come to Shanghai to submit to the court, requesting to escort both suspects back. Upon receiving this order, the Chief Prosecutor instructed that Sun Zijin and Fan Changzhu, who were in custody, be brought out from the detention center, put in shackles, and handed over to the police to be taken back to the Funing County Government for investigation.</p>
<h3>Policeman and Young Girl Tied Together and Threw Themselves into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Unable to Marry Due to Lack of Money, They Wanted to End Their Lives Together as Lovebirds</p>
<p>Having Suffered Oppression, They Had No Choice But to Make Sacrifices Together</p>
<p>Liu Hongzi, a girl from Nanjing, 18 years old, of somewhat beautiful appearance, recently fell in love with Liu Yonggang, a fourth-class policeman from the Second Precinct of the First District, for four months. Initially, they committed adultery in a small inn in Laoximen. However, the policeman was a poor scholar and could not formally marry her, so she had the idea of committing suicide, and even ending their lives together as lovebirds. Fearing that both would not die, the two tied themselves together and threw themselves into the Huangpu River at 1:00 AM yesterday. Fortunately, they were discovered by the Huangpu River patrol team and rescued, avoiding drowning. Captain Zhu notified Chief Liu Yunfang by telephone, requesting him to send police to pick them up. Chief Liu sent patrol officer Zhang Panchi and police chief Ma Jishou with a letter to the water patrol team to pick up the man and woman. According to Liu Hongzi's confession, her father, Zhang Changfu, sold eggs at the Zhabei Gonghe Road Market and died due to an accident. He borrowed 18 yuan from a person surnamed Liu in Chaozhou, using her as collateral. It has been nine years. Now her biological father has prepared 48 yuan to redeem her from Liu so that she can get married. However, the person surnamed Liu refused, so she and her lover committed suicide together. Liu Yonggang admitted to having a relationship with Liu Hongzi without denying it. Chief Liu ordered them to be sent to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>A Madman Recognizes Cai Tingkai as His Father</h3>
<p>Writing Couplets and Sending Letters Randomly</p>
<p>Cai Yunbin, the owner of Fengyu Silk Store in Chongrangli, Fourth Road, is quite capable. His store was robbed in Tianjin Road, Wufu Lane, and lost more than one hundred yuan and dozens of bolts of silk. Shortly after, a partner suddenly died of illness, and the store suffered another loss. After this stimulation, Cai became mentally disordered, mumbling to himself. His father, Cai Liansheng, rushed from Shengze after receiving the news, but his son did not recognize him as his biological father. He would often say to others, "My surname is Tao, and Liansheng is my adoptive father." Then he would claim that "My father is Cai Tingkai." His words were incoherent and his mind was greatly disturbed. His father was helpless and ordered his daughter-in-law, Xia, to send the madman to a hospital in Suzhou for treatment. He was hospitalized for three months, but did not recover. He was brought back to Shanghai last month and still lives in the Fengyu store. Unexpectedly, the madman recently wrote couplets and ordered the store clerks to distribute them to dignitaries in Shanghai, and randomly sent letters to important military and political figures in various provinces. The wording in the letters was incomprehensible. His wife could not stop him and, fearing that it would cause trouble, urgently telegraphed his father to come to Shanghai and send her husband to the Shanghai Mental Hospital for treatment. It is now reported that the madman's mind has calmed down slightly after entering the hospital, but his speech is still incoherent and incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Route See Aims</p>
<h3>Bust of a Drug Den</h3>
<p>The Perpetrators Heard the News and Fled</p>
<p>A Large Number of Appliances Confiscated</p>
<p>The French Concession Songshan Road Police Department received a tip that someone was secretly setting up a large-scale morphine drug manufacturing den at a certain place on Route See Aims, manufacturing morphine and planning to transport it to various ports and cities and sell it in this city. After receiving the report, Inspector General Jin immediately ordered the detectives to lead a number of detectives to secretly go to No. 288 Lane, Route See Aims, at about 1:00 AM yesterday, and strictly searched the households. The drug manufacturers in the small Western-style house (three stories) at No. 3 Lane had already fled after hearing the news. When the detectives searched No. 3 house, there was no one in the entire house. They confiscated morphine manufacturing equipment, such as five large colored vats, nitric acid, yi da (transliteration) liquid, alkali, and other items, as well as tables, chairs, and other wooden furniture (worth more than one thousand yuan), fully loaded in two carts. Personnel have been dispatched to investigate the main culprits and bring them to justice, and then transfer them to the court for investigation.</p>
<p>Verdict on Drug Den on Route Bai'er</p>
<p>Zhang Xingsheng Sentenced to Two Years in Prison and Fined 1,500 Yuan</p>
<p>Jiang Laidao Sentenced to Eight Months in Prison and Fined 300 Yuan</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the ninth of last month, at 5:00 PM, special operatives of the French Concession Police Department's general team raided a private red pill factory in the pavilion room at No. 298 Route Bai'er, arrested the owner, Zhang Xingsheng, also known as Gan Xiaodi, a native of Pudong, and the clerk, Jiang Laidao (a native of Tongzhou). They confiscated 46 pounds of red pills, as well as 86 bags, each bag containing 1,000 pills, and raw materials such as morphine, heroin, and other drugs, and a full set of manufacturing equipment, worth more than 200,000 yuan, and took them to the police department for delivery to the Second Special District Local Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. The details of the interrogation have been recorded in previous reports. The trial has already concluded. Yesterday morning, the day of the verdict, the police sent the two defendants to court. Judge Xiong Yun Cui presided over the first criminal court, and sentenced Zhang Xingsheng to two years in prison for manufacturing opium substitutes and fined 1,500 yuan. Jiang Laidao was sentenced to eight months in prison for helping to manufacture opium substitutes and fined 300 yuan. The fines were commuted to imprisonment. Zhang Xingsheng's total fine was converted to a daily rate based on the number of days in a year, and Jiang Laidao's fine was converted to a daily rate of two yuan. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined to be two days offsetting one day of imprisonment. The red pill drug materials and equipment were all confiscated and destroyed. After the sentencing, the two defendants were transferred to the detention center, pending the execution of the sentence after the appeal period.</p>
<p>Yuan Zhaoqing Home Robbery Case</p>
<h3>Seven More Bandits Arrested Yesterday</h3>
<p>Two Men and Five Women with Four Pistols</p>
<p>Sent to the Court for Prosecution, Rescheduled for Further Hearing</p>
<p>Yuan Zhaoqing, a native of Yancheng who resided in Xiaobangwan, Pu'en Jishi Road, French Concession, and operated a rickshaw company, was suddenly invaded by more than a dozen armed bandits at dawn on the 30th of last month, who robbed him of cash, clothing, and other items worth more than 4,000 yuan, and fled with the loot. The victim reported the loss to the French Concession Police and requested an investigation. Bao-detectives arrested the bandit gang, and obtained pistols, bullets, and stolen cash. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now it is learned that after the case occurred, Lu Zhulin, Wang Rusong, Zhang Daorong, Shen Jinshi, and Lu Jinxiang, the chief and deputy detectives of the Second Group of the Special Agency, learned that the bandits in the case would gather at the home of the bandit Xu Guifa, at No. 128 Banmenpai, Fuxu Road, in the Public Concession, at about 5:00 PM every day. So, at 5:00 PM that afternoon, they joined the Chinese and Western detectives of the Chengdu Road Police Department and secretly went to the address to arrest the bandits Chen Rongsheng (25 years old, Yangzhou), Chen Jinchang (28 years old, Yangzhou). The two Chens were brothers, and their accomplices Chen Shu (19 years old, Shaoxing, residing at No. 14 Taide Li, Cade Road), Zhang Qifu (35 years old, Yangzhou, residing at Xinzha Bridge), Zhang Guibao (31 years old, Ningbo, residing at Changsha Road), Chen Kejian (23 years old, Jiangbei, residing at No. 67 Robert Road), Zhang Asan (27 years old, Ningbo, residing upstairs at No. 82 Zhengjia Muqiao Street, Ji'an Li), and seven other people were taken back to the police station. Chen Rongsheng and Chen Jinchang confessed that they lived at No. 18 Tianyou Li, Haichang Road, Zhabei, and that their wives and female bandit accomplices were responsible for transporting weapons such as pistols. The detectives went to the Zhabei Fourth District Public Security Bureau and, together with the police detectives, went to the address to find Chen Rongsheng's wife, Chen Shi (16 years old, Danyang), Chen Jinchang's wife, Chen Ge (22 years old, Ningbo), and their female bandit accomplice Zhang Cui (also known as Jinbao, 21 years old, Tongzhou, residing at No. 27 Yanqing Li, Xiamen Road), Luo Chen (18 years old, Shandong, residing at No. 14 Chang'an Li, Chang'an Road, Zhabei), and the woman Wang Linmei (also known as Mao Nao, 18 years old, Beiping, residing at No. 65 Yongxiang Li, Gonghe Road), and five other people. They confiscated four Belanglin pistols, 49 bullets, and 300 yuan of stolen cash in Chen Rongsheng's home. The women confessed that they transported pistols, and the police chief ordered them to be detained separately. Yesterday morning, the seven male bandits were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for investigation. Judge Wu Fanglian took the seat to interrogate them. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen first stated the case, saying that the defendants were arrested in connection with the Yuan family robbery on Pu'en Jishi Road yesterday morning. Now the police station needs to investigate the case in detail, arrest the fugitives, and request a two-week postponement and temporarily detain the defendants pending investigation of the case before filing a lawsuit. The pistols and bullets were submitted to the court. Bao-detectives then reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants. After the court reviewed the report and briefly questioned each defendant, it ordered a rescheduling for further hearing on February 13th. The defendants were still sent back to detention separately.</p>
<p>Official in charge of measuring instruments</p>
<h3>Weng Yuanfan arrested for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Privately Manufacturing and Selling Measuring Instruments, Embezzling More Than One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Exposed by the Trade Association and Sent to the Bureau for Investigation</p>
<p>The measuring instruments used by rice shops in this city are sold by the trade association and must be submitted to the Bureau of Weights and Measures of the Social Affairs Bureau for approval before they can be used. Therefore, all new rice stores must purchase them from the Shanghai Rice Trade Association. Weng Yuanfan, a Ningbo native who manages the measuring instruments, privately sold these measuring instruments and embezzled more than one hundred yuan. The chairman of the trade association, Lu Wenshao, discovered the matter and checked the account books with the Bureau of Weights and Measures, obtaining ironclad evidence. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the association prepared a letter and Lu Wenshao personally escorted Weng Yuanfan to the Second Precinct of the First District for investigation. Chief Liu learned that the case involved accusations of embezzlement of measuring instruments, which belonged to the judiciary. In addition to sending the defendant to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation, he also ordered the plaintiff to go outside and wait for a summons.</p>
<p>Past Kindness Washed Away</p>
<h3>Meeting in Court After Ten Years</h3>
<p>Zhou Exuan Involved in Pleasure Grounds and Had a Son</p>
<p>Zhang Zhuying Sued for Abandonment Because of No Support</p>
<p>Zhou Weishi, a wealthy merchant from Suzhou in Shanghai, was once a prominent figure and was elected by the people of Suzhou as the chairman of the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association. Although he is now old and retired, the business he created is still thriving, so he owns a lot of assets, including land and houses. He is still running the Zhou Gengji yarn and flower shop, surrounded by children and grandchildren, enjoying a happy life. However, his eldest son Exuan and second son Duxuan do not seem to have their father's diligence and thrift, and often spend money recklessly. Duxuan's personality can be described by those who have read the "Tales of the Bund." Although he is now older, his old habits have not changed. Exuan was fond of visiting brothels when he was young. Since pimps love money and prostitutes love beauty, he was handsome and rich, and all the pleasure houses competed for his patronage. In 1924, a famous prostitute,</p>
<h3>Old Fourth of Red Chamber</h3>
<p>was then twenty-nine years old, one year younger than Exuan. They met and fell in love at first sight, and confessed their love for each other in front of the banquet lights. Soon, they bloomed together and conceived a child. As her belly grew, the onlookers criticized her. Old Fourth knew that her career would be greatly affected, and Exuan was also heartbroken. However, because his parents' control was too strict and they would never allow him to marry a prostitute, he did not dare to plan for her future. He temporarily rented a small house to hide her pregnancy until the baby was born. Fortunately, the fatherless child had a father, and Old Fourth abandoned the brothel from then on and devoted herself to</p>
<h3>Raising the Baby</h3>
<p>But this good thing was impermanent, and the pleasure ground was easy to disperse. Before long, Exuan's secret was discovered by his parents. One day, they saw Old Fourth taking the child away from home, and the two elders remained calm and went to No. 8 Xinglong Fang, Danshui Road, where Exuan hid his mistress, and moved all the furniture away. Under the overthrown nest, although the intact eggs survived, the building was no longer there. Although Exuan was rich in love, he could not disobey his strict orders and did not dare to move like Mencius' mother. He had to use the sword of wisdom to sever the relationship. The swallows flew away separately, and the orphan was temporarily raised by Old Fourth. Exuan provided the necessary living expenses on a monthly basis. This arrangement reassured his parents and gave his lover a way out. However, after this setback, Exuan realized that the sea of love is the sea of hate. Since then, he</p>
<h3>Never Went to Pleasure Grounds Again</h3>
<p>He became friends with nature, spending his time alone with a lamp, enjoying himself. In the past ten years, he did not know that his former lover had already grown into a tree full of children. Since Old Fourth left with the child, it was difficult for her to resume her career due to the burden of the child. Fortunately, she met a matchmaker and married Yu Hongru. The following year, she had another son, who is now six years old. Although Yu is nominally the father of two children, he only supports one child, so he has no relationship with this stepchild and has no love or hatred for her. Fortunately, Exuan kept his promise and has been paying for the child's support for many years. Although the father and son</p>
<h3>Met Less and Separated More</h3>
<p>They never had to worry about hunger and cold. However, Exuan stopped paying the alimony of 70 yuan after July 18th of this year. Although Old Fourth repeatedly urged him by letter, she did not receive a reply. This would make this orphan have the empty name of two fathers and not get enough to eat. Since Old Fourth is her mother, she should appeal on her behalf. Unable to get it, she sued Exuan for abandonment in the First Special District Local Court in the name of the legal guardian of Dayuan, claiming that the plaintiff Zhang Zhuying (Old Fourth's current name) went to the house of the defendant Zhou Exuan in Beijing Road, Pintang Lane, with Fang Jijiang's wife in 1924. She met Zhou and was seduced to the Dongfang Hotel on Sanma Road and raped. Later,</p>
<h3>She Became Pregnant and Gave Birth to a Son</h3>
<p>She rented a house and lived together, but was separated due to the intervention of Zhou's parents. However, the child's education expenses have been provided by the defendant since July 18th. Now he has abandoned her. According to Article 1065 of the Civil Code, a child born out of wedlock who is recognized by his father is regarded as a child born in wedlock. The defendant abandoned her and committed a crime under Article 309 of the Criminal Code. She specially filed a lawsuit requesting a summons for investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Xiangzu held a hearing and summoned both parties to appear in court. The child, Dayuan, also came to court with her mother. Exuan's brother, Duxuan, had deep brotherly feelings and came to court to listen. The official first asked both parties about their age and address, and then ordered Zhang Zhuying to state the accusation of</p>
<h3>Abandonment Facts</h3>
<p>The woman then said that she went to the defendant's house with a woman Fang Chen (Fang Jijiang's wife) to attend a savings association and met the defendant. She was then seduced and raped. At that time, he promised to marry her, but after giving birth to a son, they only lived together and did not hold a wedding. Later, they separated for some reason, but the child's living expenses were still provided by the defendant at 50 yuan per month. Recently, her brother Duxuan borrowed 200 yuan from me, but he did not repay it. I urged him to repay the debt, which caused resentment, and the defendant stopped paying the child's living expenses. Although I urged him several times by letter, he ignored me. I had to file a lawsuit. When asked, Zhou Exuan confessed that about ten years ago, he called the plaintiff to his room once in a brothel, but only knew her name was Old Fourth. After that, he</p>
<h3>Reading and Low-Level Tastes (1)</h3>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>First of all, I express my deepest sympathy and respect for your work.</p>
<p>Based on the questions answered in the "Reading Q&amp;A" column these past few days, although I strongly agree and consider them very important, I still feel that the standards set by your department's guidance are too high. The people you are currently reaching are generally young people who already have a considerable level of awareness, rather than the truly vast population of shop assistants and apprentices in Shanghai. Like the readers' letters published by your department in the past half-month, although they sometimes reveal naive and laughable opinions, they are generally somewhat aware, or have recently left school, and are originally very innocent young people. They are able to recognize their own weaknesses and are dissatisfied with their current situation. They are constantly seeking a way out, looking for light, and urgently seeking new enlightenment and new means of struggle. Therefore, as soon as they see that you have set up a "Reading Q&amp;A" section, saying that they can raise some questions and come for help, do you think they are typical representatives of the small shop assistants and apprentices in Shanghai? Sir! Then you are completely wrong. No: they are as rare as "phoenix feathers and unicorn horns" in the vast group of apprentices and shop assistants! I dare to say to you, sir, that at least 90% of the shop assistants and apprentices now either cannot stand, do not understand, or do not care about "Reading Q&amp;A"! For example, in our shop, only one "young master" reads this column besides me. And he is only curious and does not want to learn anything from it.</p>
<p>Does this mean that other people don't need to read anything? No! They still hold things in their hands to read during their free time. They still need to read. What do you ask them to read? Oh my! They read those low-level newspapers that specialize in selling social news and the general "newspaper scraps" of two or three kinds of "so-called literary beggars." After reading, they laugh heartily and finish without any concern. They also read books, but mostly old novels: martial arts, supernatural, and melodramatic romances of talented scholars and beautiful ladies. The most popular new things are "A Laughing Marriage," "Fleeting Years," "Tilly," "A Collection of Love Letters," "A History of Sexuality," "The Art of Sexuality," and "Red Flower Vase." They regard anything else as nothing. They are all wallowing in low-level tastes. Naturally, I am also a survivor of that kind of life, so I know very well. In the past two years, I have read many articles criticizing low-level tastes in some higher-level magazines and newspapers, which shocked me. I realized that I was drowning in this sea of suffering and unable to extricate myself. Because I got this enlightenment, I am no longer satisfied with those old grains. I want to ask for new grains. However, although I clearly know that the old grains are unsanitary, I still don't know how to get new grains. We are wandering on a diverging path. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Chunqiu</p>
<h3>Working Silently and Working Hard</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>If someone asks, "Which country in the world has the most ingenious minds and the best eloquence?" I would answer without hesitation: "Of course, it's the Chinese!" At the same time, I also feel that the ingenuity and eloquence of the Chinese are not just a current fact, but have become a national characteristic. Just look at any organization with several committees with strangely beautiful names; which big shot doesn't know how to sing a few lines of high-sounding words with accurate pronunciation; this is an extremely obvious ironclad proof! In particular, the names of the committees can change from time to time and emerge endlessly, and the wording of the high-sounding words often brings forth the new from the old, without any duplication, which is enough to make people from the East and the West admire and bow down, and is indeed the supreme glory of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Recently, a few big shots have invented two high-sounding words on their lips: one is "working silently" and the other is "working hard." For a time, all kinds of people, from chickens to dogs, imitated each other, and the mountains roared and the valleys responded, resounding throughout the world; I think that if we, the ignorant people, can all obediently drink these two "words of medicine and stone," China will be largely saved!</p>
<p>The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>The meaning of the phrase "working silently" is that the people who are working at this moment, because of various difficulties and concerns, or even to seek quick results, have to hide their heads and tails and work secretly. Sometimes they really want to explain to the viewers the reasons why they are doing this, but because they do not want to attract the attention of third parties, they have to keep silent and work on their own; conversely, it means that the viewers should not ask any questions to the workers, and let them work freely; then the workers can rest assured and work silently until a certain result is achieved, and China's way out can be solved no matter what! As for "working hard," that is even more valuable! Because we all know that China's current social state is very unstable, and the reason for the instability is that some people are too proud and some people are too frustrated, so they squeeze each other and cause all kinds of misfortunes. If everyone can practice "working hard," then the oppressed people will naturally continue to be docile and do the work of cattle and horses; and the positions of those who have already become officials and made a fortune can be stabilized from now on. In this way, "working silently" and "working hard" will be carried out separately, and naturally, a peaceful scene of no thieves and no closed outer doors will be achieved! China will have no reason not to be strong! If there are still people who do not understand what I am saying, I can explain it more thoroughly. That is, a person who has already made a fortune from opening a gambling house will often advocate strictly prohibiting gambling and ask people not to investigate the origins of his family property; his mentality is the same as that of the big shots who sing high-sounding words of "working silently" and "working hard."</p>
<p>On this road, it is full of traces of foreign little heroes. When I look at their clothes and demeanor, I can't help but admire them. They wear a short coat on their upper body and a thin knitted shirt inside. They wear woolen shorts on their lower body, and their feet are still exposed. This is the boy's clothing. The girls wear short hair, open their chests, and wear short coats, long socks, and shorts. In this biting cold wind, they walk with a majestic and high-spirited gait, without any shrinking necks or sleeves, or fear of the cold. Looking at their complexions, they are all rosy and strong. Looking at their manners, they are lively and brave. I can't help but secretly praise: "Little heroes: truly little heroes!" As I walk, I think to myself: "There are our children here, and there are also schools run by us. Why don't I see our little heroes? Could it be that they are all afraid of the cold and shrinking in their quilts? No! I don't think that's the case."</p>
<p>Here they come! Our little heroes are here! This elementary school student's family must be of a small bourgeois class, because there is an old nanny following him and carrying his schoolbag for him. Looking at this little hero's dress, he is wrapped in a thick woolen coat that drags to his instep. Inside, he is wearing thick clothes, I don't know what kind, presumably fur coats, silk cotton-padded jackets, etc. He wears thick velvet shoes on his feet and a Luzon hat on his head, with the brim pulled down, only revealing his eyes and nose. When I look at his bloated and slow dress, he looks like a short winter melon, and I can't help but be secretly surprised. The future masters, the future great citizens, are now so pampered,</p>
<h3>Baodai Bridge is Smaller Than Chuihong Bridge</h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>The most beautiful and spiritual place on the Suzhou-Jiaxing Motor Road is Baodai Bridge. On one side is the calm as a mirror Lake Tantai, and on the other is the canal with sails facing each other. You can also see Shangfang Mountain in the distance, with a small pagoda rising like a pen. Originally, if the wind was a little stronger on Baodai Bridge, it would not be very safe to walk even empty-handed. How could cars pass through? Therefore, to allow cars to pass, another wooden bridge was built, parallel to Baodai Bridge, with a similar height, which is also considered a special construction. The people of Suzhou say that the number of arches in Baodai Bridge is uncountable. Because you can only count them from afar in a boat, but it is easy to get dizzy. In fact, there are fifty-three arches, which is naturally a great building in Jiangnan. However, I saw in a Song Dynasty note that Baodai Bridge is also called "Little Chang Bridge." Then where is the Big Chang Bridge, since there is a Little one? I need to explain this. Originally, there was a Chuihong Bridge east of the city of Wujiang County, which was even longer than Baodai Bridge, so even today, the people of Wujiang call it "Chang Bridge." After all, how many arches does Chang Bridge have? The gazetteer does not state this. (Qian Gongfu's "Notes on the Bridge of Profit" in the Song Dynasty says it is "more than a thousand feet east to west, with tens of thousands of market woods." It is probably a wooden bridge, and a thousand feet is certainly longer than Baodai Bridge). However, over the years, most of it has become blocked. One end of it has become land, which is the Kanbo Bridge in front of the county government. A stone stele tower, and the general system that stands majestically at that end, is enough to prove that they are facing each other from east to west, and the stone lions at both ends of Baodai Bridge are decorations of Chang Bridge.</p>
<p>I saw a round fan painted by an anonymous Song Dynasty painter in the "Forbidden City Weekly," which is a picture of Chuihong Bridge, also winding and lying on the waves, with endless water and sky on the left and right, which is indeed more magnificent than Baodai Bridge. From this point of view, Chuihong Bridge was really longer than Baodai Bridge at that time. What is the use of these archaeological studies that are not of great significance?</p>
<p>But looking at the gradual silting up of Chuihong Bridge, the vicissitudes of Taihu Lake are truly shocking. Great buildings cannot last forever. Jiang Baishi's poem "Passing Chuihong in Heavy Snow": "I carve new words with the most charming rhymes, and Xiaohong sings softly as I play the flute. When the song ends, I pass the Songling Road, and look back at the misty waves of the fourth bridge." Even today, the misty waves are unharmed, but the romantic past is gone. How can it not make people feel emotional?</p>

<p>True love cannot be described with pen and ink, expressed in words, or shown in actions. What is the difference between cohabitation and marriage? The former is a secret that is made public; the latter is a secret that is made public. "One's own articles are good, and other people's wives are good!" But in the eyes of lovers, there is a different view! Because one's wife may not be one's lover; and one's lover may not be one's wife.</p>
<p>"Everyone can perform magic tricks, but the skill varies." It is said that the way of love is also like this! Socializing should be open, but love should not be squandered!</p>
<p>It is no longer "a devoted woman with a heartless man." Nowadays, things have turned upside down.</p>
<h3>Our Little Heroes</h3>
<p>— Rongyu</p>
<p>At eight o'clock in the morning, I was walking on North Sichuan Road. The weather was really too cold, and the accumulated water on the side of the road was blown by the cold wind and formed ice crystals. The asphalt road surface was also frozen as hard as an iron plate, and the warm cotton shoes lost their effectiveness when stepped on it. At this time, most of the shops on both sides were not open. Only trams and buses were running on the road, with only a few scattered passengers. After passing Laobazi Road, there were more people walking on the road, in twos and threes, all students going to school. Upon closer inspection, there were also Japanese children and Western children. Oh! That's right! At the end of North Sichuan Road, there is a Western children's school. At the north end of Yokohama Bridge, there is a Japanese elementary school. So, what will they do in the morning, at noon, and in the evening? How will they shoulder the important responsibility of their families and countries? Alas! Our little heroes.</p>
<p>As I walked, I thought to myself: "People are desperately cultivating brave citizens to compete and dominate on the world stage; we are cultivating melancholy and sickly young masters, preparing to perform "Winning the Top Scholar, Secretly Agreeing on Marriage" and other plays in the future." May the world of Great Harmony and the world of peace appear quickly, otherwise, how will our citizens deal with them?</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p>
<p>The Pain is Unbearable, Concentrate and Listen to the Drums and Music</p>
<p>The Happy Time is Not Enough, Hastily Parting to the Flying Talisman</p>
<p>Guizhi had already washed her face and was applying snow cream on it, saying jokingly: I am an old-fashioned woman, and I don't understand what you are talking about. Zhao Ziqiang smiled and said: You don't understand? You are much smarter than me. Haha! You are wrong, why are you rubbing the powder puff on the rouge box? Guizhi looked back and saw that she was indeed pressing the powder puff on the rouge. She smiled and said: I am really a bit absurd. If I put this powder puff on my face, I will become Guan Erye. The two laughed heartily as they spoke. At this time, Jiang came to the back courtyard, wanting to say a few words to her daughter. Because her daughter had not come out of the new room, she was not comfortable rushing in, so she stood at the door of Zhao Weng's room. Zhao Weng greeted her and said: Old lady, do you have something to say? Jiang said: I am looking for our daughter to say a word. She is having a lively conversation with her son-in-law in the new room, so I won't interrupt. Zhao Weng smiled and said: Old lady always loves her children so much. Jiang said: It's not like that. As parents, who doesn't want their husband and wife to be harmonious? Zhao Weng stroked his beard, nodded, and didn't say anything more. Naturally, Jiang was not comfortable talking to her father-in-law about these personal matters of her children. After saying a few casual words, she left. Family talk is not necessarily very important. If there is no time to say it tonight, there will be tomorrow. If there is no time to say it tomorrow, there will be tomorrow night. However, Jiang's speculation was not very consistent. Except for coming out to eat two meals, Guizhi was always in the new room. Jiang always had no chance to speak. She thought to herself that her daughter had already married for five days. Although newlyweds should be very sweet, they shouldn't be so sweet to this extent. Could there be another reason?

<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Three New Year's Eves (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>"What does this count for?" Cheng Yuan replied indifferently. Just then, a little beggar came up to him to ask for money, and he casually took out five or six copper coins and threw them over.</p>
<p>"Hey! Old Cheng!" Li Yun suddenly thought of Wu Baojun. "I heard that Wu Baojun lost money running a hotel. What's he doing now?" "He ran away long ago!"</p>
<p>(3) This Year!</p>
<p>New Year's Eve came again.</p>
<p>As usual, it was still the thirtieth night of the twelfth lunar month. Although the government offices did not have a holiday, the lard New Year's cakes from the Laoda House were still snatched empty by customers, and the streets were still filled with a lively atmosphere and a New Year's scene.</p>
<p>At six o'clock in the afternoon, Li Yun received a call from an employee at Cheng Yuan's law firm, saying that Lawyer Cheng was inviting him to have New Year's Eve dinner at Lawyer Cheng's new residence on ×× Road in the French Concession.</p>
<p>After putting down the receiver on the telephone, Li Yun hesitated. He knew that ×× Road in the French Concession was very far from his home, and there were no direct trams or buses to it. What made him feel particularly inconvenient was that going back and forth was inconvenient, so he decided not to go.</p>
<p>Although Cheng Yuan had really become rich, he was still willing to treat old friends politely. He even realized the difficulty that Li Yun could not go to, and even sent his coachman to drive a brand-new Buick sedan to Li's house to pick up Li Yun. At the same time, he also taught the car to bring a message, saying: "Wu Baojun is also present."</p>
<p>Li Yun was still wearing a suit and a velvet hat, but when he stepped into Cheng Yuan's new residence, he immediately felt uneasy; above his head, shining were new-style electric lights worth more than a hundred gold coins; under his feet, lined was a three- or four-inch thick velvet carpet woven with delicate patterns; the most modern sofas, unusual hot water radiators, and the luxurious clothes of the host and hostess, all burned him as if with fire! He felt that he was no longer a phoenix, but a pheasant!</p>
<p>After a round of greetings, the host and guests returned to their seats. Servants brought up a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>"The young master of the Malanji just came and said that you still owe him a debt. Because it was a small amount of sixty or seventy yuan, I have already paid it for you." Cheng Yuan whispered to Li Yun.</p>
<p>Li Yun himself did not understand why his face suddenly felt particularly hot. He put his right hand in his pocket, and after a long time, he couldn't find anything.</p>
<p>"I...I...I will return it in a few days..." Before Li Yun finished speaking, Cheng Yuan shook his head non-stop and used a cigar to block Li Yun's mouth, telling him not to say anything more. The meaning was "no need to calculate." Li Yun was of course so grateful that he almost made a bow to him.</p>
<p>Just as they were about to take their seats, Wu Baojun rushed over in disheveled clothes, just like eight years ago. His attitude was unusually flustered. Li Yun was just about to ask him why he was late, and his straightforward answer was automatically sent over.</p>
<p>"Your days are really too comfortable! Isn't today New Year's Eve! Who won't give some money to force us to get through it!"</p>
<p>Now, Li Yun didn't dare to laugh at him secretly anymore, and only let out a long sigh of sympathy.</p>
<p>At that time, the host had already led forty or fifty guests into the restaurant.</p>

<p>Identification and Evaluation of Students from Non-Registered and Closed Vocational Schools in Shanghai</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 31st) The Ministry of Education, based on the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education's submission of students from the private Cultural College's Shanghai Second Institute, the private New China College, and graduates and students from other non-registered or closed private vocational schools above the specialist level, has completed the Ministry's evaluation and review. The total number of people who should be identified and tested this time is 528. Among them, 442 passed. Among the passing students, 112 maintained their original grade level, 39 only took basic courses, 156 were demoted by one year, 98 were demoted by two years, 34 were demoted by three years, and 3 were demoted by four years. 77 failed, 88 were not issued certificates, and 2 were not allowed to take the exam. All transfer certificates for the passing students, 31 in total, were ordered by the Ministry of Education to be forwarded by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education according to name.</p>
<h3>Rectification of Elementary Schools in Hunan Province</h3>
<p>▲ Teachers Must All Be Normal School Graduates</p>
<p>(Changsha, 31st) Zhu Jingnong, Director of the Hunan Provincial Department of Education, believes that the province's elementary school teachers are extremely chaotic, with a mix of good and bad, and have lost their teaching ability. There are more than 23,000 elementary schools in the province, including 800 schools of four types, including provincial and private senior elementary schools. It is planned to rectify the above four types of schools first, and all will be replaced by normal school graduates to comply with the educational purpose, and then promoted in turn. At the same time, an elementary school teacher certification will be held.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Education in Jiangxi Province (3)</h3>
<p>| Report by Special Commissioner Li Ximou of the Ministry of Education |</p>
<p>(18) The full-time teachers of junior high schools in the province are required to teach 24 hours per week, and the full-time teachers of senior high schools are required to teach 22 hours per week. However, due to the fact that subject hours cannot be divided, they can all vary by one or two hours, and their salaries will not increase or decrease due to this. For the second item, teachers who hold concurrent positions, the director of teaching affairs or the director of academic affairs of junior high schools, teach 15 hours per week; the deputy director of teaching affairs or the director of moral education and the director of affairs teach 18 hours; the grade director teaches 30 hours; the director of teaching affairs or the director of academic affairs of complete middle schools teach 12 hours; the deputy director of teaching affairs or the director of moral education and the director of affairs teach 16 hours; the grade director teaches 18 or 20 hours; the department director teaches 18 hours. In fact, they are all still appropriate. (B) Regarding normal schools, (1) The province's normal schools have been established independently. (2) The province's rural normal schools have been divided into five districts. (3) Provincial normal schools and rural normal schools all waive tuition fees, and rural normal schools also waive all meal fees, while normal schools subsidize half of the meals. (4) The province has formulated regulations on scholarships and grants for students in secondary and above schools, which are now being implemented. (5) The teaching hours per week for principals and teachers of normal schools are roughly the same as those for middle schools. (6) The methods for teacher training include the establishment of correspondence courses for teachers of literature, history, and geography, a sports research association, a music education committee, and a science education research association, and a budget of 2,000 yuan for teacher training expenses is listed for the purpose of selecting and sending teachers to visit and inspect abroad. (C) Regarding vocational schools, (1) Provincial vocational schools have always recruited elementary school graduates or those with equivalent academic qualifications, with a study period of three or five years, and recruited junior high school graduates or graduates from schools equivalent to junior high schools, with a study period of three years. However, starting from the 22nd year, the study period for primary schools will be separately stipulated according to the nature of the profession, in order to conform to the regulations promulgated by the Ministry. (2) Provincial vocational schools, except for pottery schools, the second vocational school, and midwifery schools, are all set up with a single department. The others, such as the first vocational school and the women's vocational school, are set up with several departments. However, the agricultural and forestry school is the merger of the original fourth agricultural school and the forestry school, because it is of a primary nature, so the two departments of agriculture and forestry are combined into one department. (3) There are vocational classes attached to elementary schools, and it is planned to gradually promote them. (4) The regular expenses for each junior and senior high school class are the same as the regular expenses for each junior and senior vocational class. However, for each junior and senior vocational class, an additional 500 yuan is added for practical training expenses. For those with farm expenses, the budget is prepared according to the actual situation. (5) Regulations on subsidies for private vocational schools have been drafted and will be submitted to the provincial government for approval before being submitted to the Ministry for approval. The subsidy standard is higher than the standard for subsidizing middle schools. (6) The number of teaching hours per week for teachers and staff of vocational schools in the province is roughly the same as that for middle schools. (D) Regarding elementary schools, (1) There are no longer any senior elementary schools established separately. (2) Private church middle schools have attached elementary schools and kindergartens, but the results are very good, and local education is still not developed, so it seems that there is still a need for this. (The original report also has 25 articles of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education's strict elementary school regulations, which are omitted here. In addition, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education has submitted a separate report on matters related to the middle and primary school graduation joint examination, which will not be repeated). (To be continued)</p>
<p>Elementary School Teacher Certification Examination</p>
<h3>Should Focus on the Degree of Party Ideology</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 31st) The Ministry of Education approved the letter from the Central Civil Movement Steering Committee, stating that among the subjects of the elementary school teacher certification examination stipulated by the Social Bureau of Beijing City this time, there is actually no item on Party Ideology, which is very inappropriate. Please investigate and promptly order corrections, and formulate certification methods so that there is something to follow. Before the promulgation of these methods, please order the educational administrative organs of all provinces and cities to pay attention to their degree of Party Ideology when conducting certification examinations. The Ministry issued an order on the 31st to all departments and bureaus to comply.</p>
<p>Order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education</p>
<h3>Regarding Matters Related to the Senior High School Joint Examination</h3>
<p>▲ Students Who Fail in One or Two Subjects Are Allowed to Take the Examination Again, Following the Example of Repeating a Grade Twice</p>
<p>Order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education to the directors of the education bureaus of all counties: It is noted that Article 10 of the Middle School Student Graduation Joint Examination Regulations previously stipulated that "Senior high school students who fail in two or one subject are allowed to participate in the next joint examination for each subject. If they wish to continue their studies, they may be issued a certificate of application for admission by the competent educational administrative organ... They are allowed to take the entrance examination first, and after being admitted, they are allowed to be treated as probationary students. They may not be treated as regular students until they have participated in and passed the next joint examination for each subject and obtained a graduation certificate." Upon detailed examination of the articles, there still seems to be some ambiguity. In the event that they still fail in the next joint examination for each subject, those who have not continued their studies will certainly not be able to graduate, and those who have continued their studies will not be able to be treated as regular students, which will greatly hinder the students' future. Can they be allowed to participate in the next joint examination for each subject once again, following the example of repeating a grade twice, in order to provide relief and show guidance? After submitting a request to the church headquarters for instructions, the following was received in the instructions: "I have learned that the request to allow senior high school students who fail in two or one subject to participate in the next joint examination for each subject once again, following the example of repeating a grade twice, should be approved as proposed. You should immediately inform them of this order." In addition to forwarding it, this order is hereby issued for the directors of each bureau to forward it to all public and private senior high schools under their jurisdiction for their information. This order.</p>
<h3>Regulations on Freight Rates for Educational Supplies</h3>
<p>▲ Revised and Promulgated by the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 31st) The Ministry of Railways believes that the special price regulations for the railway transportation of educational supplies are inconsistent with the current situation. On the 31st, they were revised and promulgated by order of the Ministry and inspected by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>Mallek Arrives in Tianjin Yesterday</h3>

<p>Boy Scout Troop of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Commemorates Four Martyrs</p>
<p>The Boy Scout Troop of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a memorial service for the four boy scout martyrs at 7:00 AM yesterday in the conference room on the third floor. More than 100 people attended, including Yan E-sheng, representative of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Peiyuan, director of the Chinese Red Cross Society, representative Li Ke-sai, and family members of the martyrs. Troop leader Ye Chunnian presided over the meeting, and Xu Guozhi recorded the proceedings. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Opening Ceremony (1) Lowering the flag to half-mast; (2) Playing mournful music; (3) Chamber of Commerce representative laying flowers; (4) Red Cross representative laying flowers; (5) Troop representative laying flowers; (6) Paying respects (representatives in the same order as above); (7) Chairman's report; (8) Speech by the Chamber of Commerce representative; (9) Speech by the Red Cross representative; (10) Reply by the family representative; (11) Singing a dirge; (12) United Photoplay Service showing a memorial film.</p>
<p>▲Speeches by Representatives Chairman Ye Chunnian reported on the purpose of the meeting. Yan E-sheng, representative of the Chamber of Commerce, said in his speech: "Today is the second anniversary of the martyrdom of the four boy scouts. We should mourn, but on the other hand, we should congratulate them. Because in society, people often cannot equalize their enjoyment with their contributions. The four boy scouts were not in high positions in society during their lifetimes, and they were young. Their enjoyment from society was certainly meager. However, they were able to serve the country and sacrifice themselves, and now they are being remembered by everyone. Therefore, their contribution to society can be said to be very great, so we should congratulate them." Red Cross representative, Mr. Li, representing Wang Peiyuan, said: "Two years ago, this morning, I was directing the Red Cross rescue team to depart for the disaster area in the war zone. I personally handed the badges to the four martyrs, but after they left, they have not returned to this day. We should commemorate their sacrifice for the country, and we should work even harder." Finally, the family members of the four martyrs replied one by one, and the meeting adjourned at 8:30 AM.</p>

<p>After the Ministry of Education Ordered Five Universities to Suspend Night Schools</p>
<h3>Law and Political Science Students Discuss Countermeasures</h3>
<p>▲A General Assembly of All Night School Students Will Be Held at Tongyi Middle School on February 4th</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously sent personnel to inspect the night schools run by five universities in Shanghai, including Soochow, Aurora, the School of Commerce, the National School of Commerce, Law and Political Science, and Chih Tze, and found that they were inconsistent with the educational regulations of the schools and had many drawbacks. Therefore, it specifically ordered the schools to stop enrolling new night school students and to separately conclude the studies of existing students in accordance with their own methods. The news was reported yesterday. It is now learned that after hearing the news, the night school students of the Law and Political Science College convened a general meeting to discuss countermeasures. The announcement is recorded as follows: Since the news of the Ministry of Education's order to suspend night classes at various schools spread, the public has been panicked and extremely surprised. In order to understand the true meaning of the Ministry of Education's order and to discuss countermeasures, a general meeting of all Class B (i.e., night class) students of this school will be held at Tongyi Middle School at the intersection of Foch Road and Route Maréchal Joffre at 1:00 PM on Sunday, February 4th. All Class B students are requested to attend the meeting to discuss progress together. This matter concerns your studies, so please do not neglect it. Initiated by the Class B Friendship Association of the Fourth Year of the Department of Law.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Soochow Night School will not be enrolling students this year. Other schools have all complied with the order to stop enrollment. It is expected that they will be closed after the existing students graduate. The National Central School of Commerce will be closed immediately. The Class B of the Aurora Night School, which is purely remedial in nature and does not confer degrees, will continue to enroll students.</p>
<p>Five County Association Stops Operation</p>
<h3>Dispute Arises Over Founding Middle School</h3>
<p>▲The Association Decided to Stop Operation Due to Expenditure</p>
<p>▲The School Believes This Move is Intentional Sabotage</p>
<p>(Shanghai Society Report) The Shanghai Founding Middle School on Xietu Road in Shanghai, which was established by the Tongzhi Chonghai Qiwu County Association, currently has more than 200 students and the school's operations are developing well. Recently, a small number of executive committee members of the association, citing insufficient funding, decided to temporarily suspend operations, which has caused disputes and the school has fallen into a state of suspension. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Cause of the Dispute The Founding Middle School, established by the Shanghai Tongzhi Chonghai Qiwu County Association, has only been operating for one semester. Due to internal differences of opinion and frequent storms, expenditures have exceeded the limit by more than three times, and the school is heavily in debt and unable to maintain operations. Therefore, the association recently decided to temporarily suspend operations pending reorganization. However, the faculty and staff and all students of the school believe that the establishment of the Founding Middle School was based on a resolution of the ninth general assembly of the association, and Tang Jingzong was recommended as the principal by the first board of directors. In the past half year, there have been no transgressions, but a small number of executive committee members of the association arbitrarily acted alone, treating laws and regulations as child's play and education as worthless, which is extremely heartbreaking. For the sake of protecting the school-aged children of the five counties, in addition to reporting the situation to the Municipal Education Bureau, they vowed to fight to the end with those who advocated stopping the school. As a result, both sides went to extremes, the dispute has not ended, and the school has fallen into a state of suspension.</p>
<p>▲Principal's Statement According to Tang Jingzong, the principal of the school, speaking to a Shanghai Society reporter, there are as many as 700,000 people from the five counties in Shanghai, and there are more than 100,000 school-aged children. This school was established to help school-aged children from these counties who are out of school, and it was approved by the general assembly of all members. Now, a small number of people are forcing the school to close due to their private opinions, which is contrary to the purpose of running the school. He has reported the situation to the Education Bureau for record, and since he has served as the principal, he has been physically and mentally exhausted and intends to retire voluntarily to make way for a more capable person.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Center Art Exhibition Opens Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal People's Education Center, in order to arouse the public's interest in appreciating art and cultivate noble character, has been approved by the Municipal Education Bureau to hold a large-scale art exhibition. It is scheduled to open today in the Health Education Exhibition Room in front of the center. The exhibition will last for 40 days. There are currently hundreds of works on display, such as calligraphy by Ma Gongyu and others, traditional Chinese paintings by Yu Jianhua, Xie Gongzhan, and others, Western paintings by Mao Zhizhong, Liu Zhenchun, and others, photography by Shui Fuping and others, as well as embroidery, weaving, pottery, porcelain, lacquerware, and other items, all of which are very exquisite.</p>
<h3>University Magazine Volume Two, Issue One is Published</h3>
<p>The University Monthly, which is run by the University Magazine Society at No. 304, Mainland Commercial Plaza, Nanjing Road, Shanghai, has passed its first anniversary in an instant and is popular throughout the country.

<h3>Sports</h3>
<p>Western Youth Women's Basketball</p>
<p>Ms. White's Absence Gives</p>
<p>Liangjiang Another Championship</p>
<p>｜Result: 36 to 23｜</p>
<p>▲Excellent Performances, the Situation Was Extremely Tense Throughout</p>
<p>▲Although Ms. White Was Absent, the Strength Was Still Strong</p>
<p>Because Ms. White of the American Women's team was absent due to illness, Liangjiang was able to win the Western Youth Women's Basketball Championship again. The final was held last night, and the Western Youth Gymnasium was packed with spectators, making it even more lively. Although Ms. White of the American Women's team was absent, the fighting was still fierce. Liangjiang still had a difficult time winning. The result was 36 to 23. If the American Women's defense had not been chaotic in the fourth quarter, the score difference would not have been so great.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Situation</h3>
<p>In terms of the two teams' performances, their movements were agile and the situation was very tense. From beginning to end, it was full of strong interest. Liangjiang's Chen Rongming and Yang Sen were brave and fierce, no less than the female players, and their coordination was wonderful and their shooting was accurate. The best defender in the back was Chen Baixue. The overall skill of the team was really above the American Women's team. The biggest reason for the American Women's team's defeat was the absence of the main player, which caused the entire line to collapse. However, Meng Lai's good fighting spirit and Bao Heke's liveliness were also commendable. Wallace's defense was okay, but her movements were not as fast as Liangjiang's, and her technique was slightly inferior. Failure was inevitable.</p>
<h3>American Women Take the Lead</h3>
<p>The American Women's team had great ambition and struck first, giving Liangjiang a great threat everywhere. Bao Waike opened the scoring, and Liangjiang gradually sought development. The forwards coordinated and gradually became more coordinated. Chen Rongming hit two long shots, and then both sides each added one point. Liangjiang took the lead with 5 to 3, and there was great cheering. The American Women's team was not discouraged at all. Bao Shaike attacked from the back road, and Meng Lai coordinated in the center, scoring five points in a row. 5 to 8, Liangjiang was at a disadvantage. Chen Rongming scored another long shot, making it 7 to 8. The first quarter ended.</p>
<h3>Liangjiang Revives</h3>
<p>After a short rest, Liangjiang's momentum suddenly increased. The American Women's back defense sometimes had the disadvantage of attending to one thing and losing sight of another, and their dribbling was slow, so Liangjiang often slipped in to take advantage. After winning one point on a foul, Yang Sen returned the favor with one point. Chen Rongming scored two more goals, and the score exceeded again. After Bao Shaike scored another free throw, they lost four more points in a row. So Liangjiang led with 16 to 10. From then on, the foundation was solid and everything went smoothly.</p>
<h3>The Golden Age</h3>
<p>However, the American Women's team's arrogance did not diminish, and the counter-offensive momentum was still extremely strong, making Liangjiang's heart of vigilance not to be relaxed. Meng Lai scored two, making it 14 to 16, and then 16 to 18. Liangjiang rose up and added three points. At this time, both teams were in full swing, their arrogance was extraordinary, and they each made contributions. The situation was balanced, and Liangjiang still maintained a superior position due to the advantage in the second quarter. At the end of the third quarter, 24 to 18, Liangjiang was still six points ahead.</p>
<h3>A Thousand Miles at a Single Stroke</h3>
<p>In the last quarter, the American Women's back defense was relaxed, and the frequent substitution of players made the lineup scattered and unsustainable. Liangjiang was on the rise, scoring again and again, once reaching 33 to 20. The overall situation was set, and the championship was in hand. In the final result, Liangjiang won with 36 to 23.</p>

Seizing the initiative, Tongji scored in one fell swoop, opening the scoring. Mailing launched a fierce attack, and Tongji bravely fought back, 6 to 5, 8 to 7, only trailing Mailing by one point. Mailing brought in Maolai, and the score became unmanageable. In the first half, Mailing had twenty-eight, and Tongji only nine. In the second half, the tall Locke was transferred out, and Mailing's momentum declined slightly, but Tongji still did not improve. As a result, Mailing won a big victory with 52 to 15. )</p>

<h3>Tianjin's Strength is Very Strong</h3>
<p>▲ The Midfield is the Most Solid</p>
<p>The Tianjin interport football team roster has long been decided, and they have practiced several times, with excellent results. Last Sunday (the 28th), they played their fourth trial match against a mixed team, with the interport team winning 9-0. The forwards Er Qiongsi, A Qi'er, and Jiang Lu performed the best, and the center-back line was as solid as an iron gate, blocking the enemy and preventing them from deploying. Their lineup is as follows:</p>

<h3>A Record of Jiaoda's Northern Expedition (1)</h3>
<p>First Match: 2-4 Loss to Fu Jen Catholic University</p>
<p>Fu Jen's Individual Techniques Surpass Jiaoda's</p>
<p>Jiaoda Lacks Stamina, Coordination is Acceptable</p>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, the atmosphere is bleak, and the sports world is dull. The arrival of the Jiaoda team in Beiping (Beijing) breaks the silence. Sunday the 28th was the date for the meeting between Fu Jen, the King of North China, and Shanghai Jiaoda. There was a stream of carriages in front of Dingfu Street, and the Fu Jen field was teeming with people, creating an unprecedented scene, like the bustling of Changdian (a temple fair). It was already half past two. The two armies had been testing their feet for a long time, and Wang Zhensheng was appointed as the referee. After a brief introduction, the guest started first. Jiaoda kicked off, taking advantage of the wind, and was extremely pleased. There was a commotion in front of the Fu Jen goal, and after it calmed down, they launched another attack.</p>
<p>▲The Sharpness is Compelling, All Phenomena are Extraordinary: Wan Xianghua's cross from the flank fell directly in front of the goal. Wang Yumin was being watched, and Zhou Guangzhong successfully headed the ball in. It was only three minutes after the opening. Misfortunes never come singly for Fu Jen: Wu You'an touched the ball with his hand, resulting in a penalty. Zhou Guangzhong knocked on the door again; a penalty kick was inevitable. In an instant, Jiaoda won two consecutive goals, and the surrounding spectators were sweating for Fu Jen.</p>
<p>▲Desperate Counterattack: The Fu Jen soldiers were not discouraged, and continued to work hard, launching frequent attacks. They advanced from the left, waiting for an opportunity to strike. Jiaoda's defender, the brave Wang Changying, was overly aggressive and committed a foul. Because it was in the defensive area, another penalty was awarded. Tang Guoliang was indeed skilled, kicking the ball into the goal. Fu Jen saw a turning point from this point onward. Having been hammered by Jiaoda, they now began to press their guests.</p>
<p>▲Stealing the Spotlight: Before long, goalkeeper Fan Jiaxun hastily carried the ball out, resulting in an indirect free kick within the six-yard box. The Jiaoda goal was like a marketplace, with the entire team retreating to defend, forming a human wall. They could not be penetrated, and after circling for a long time, Wang Jingxi, the "flying grass," shot at the goal from ten steps away, hitting the crossbar squarely. Jiaoda was in danger, almost suffering an unexpected setback. Later, Xue Youxiu, the guest team's hidden weapon, suddenly rose up, and Wan Xianghua passed an arrow, directly attacking the empty city. Fu Jen's defender, Yang Puzhi, was deployed elsewhere, and Wang Yumin put on a show in an empty city. Lao Xue shot directly at the corner of the goal, but was saved. It was Fu Jen's luck that this ball did not go in. The first half ended here.</p>
<p>▲Displaying Heroic Spirit: Jiaoda took the lead, taking a 2-1 lead. After the lemon time, the teams met again. The Jiaoda team remained the same, while the Fu Jen army was even stronger. Lin Jianpeng was mediocre and useless, making the most mistakes in the frontcourt, so Li Hongzhong replaced him. The left-wing formation immediately appeared more organized, riding the wind and waves with great power. Wu You'an headed the ball once, hitting the crossbar again. Zhang Zhizhen took a corner kick from the flank, and the soldiers in front of the goal were bustling. However, Li Fenglou arrived like a fly, pushing through the troops and touching the net with his head, resulting in a 2-2 tie. Jiaoda, seeing that the situation was not good, with their good fortune about to be washed away, struggled to counterattack, but it was like rowing against the current, extremely laborious. Moreover, their momentum had waned, while Fu Jen's momentum was rising. The end of a strong arrow cannot penetrate cloth. Therefore, they struggled, resulting in a one-sided situation, frequently hovering in front of the Jiaoda goal.</p>
<p>▲Jiaoda Loses: The generals of Fu Jen staged a "Hongmen Banquet," inviting the overlord as a guest. The great flanker Zhang Zhizhen looked back at the moon, and Fan Jiaxun quickly punched the ball out, but it was crowded by the chaotic army and touched the net again. The left-wing generals Li Hongzhong, Wu You'an, and the "tenth sister" Lian Xuanxun were originally old partners from Huiwen, passing the ball in triangles, traversing the formation. Li Hongzhong once shot, but the goalkeeper tipped the ball out of bounds. Zhang Zhizhen was familiar with the road, and took another corner kick, with unique skill, rotating directly into the goal. The overall situation became 4-2. From this point on, neither side made any progress. Fu Jen turned defeat into victory, and finally sang a triumphant song.</p>
<p>▲Fu Jen Catholic University</p>
<p>Lin Jianpeng</p>
<p>Yang Puzhi Lin Songfa Wu You'an</p>
<p>Wang Yumin Tang Guoliang Li Hongzhong</p>
<p>Fu Xinqiu Li Fenglou Lian Yixun</p>
<p>Wang Jingxi</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhen</p>
<p>▲Jiaotong University</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua</p>
<p>Chen Gongyu Li Zhaoliang Gong Yibin</p>
<p>Fan Jiaju Shen Guanlan Zhou Guangzhong</p>
<p>Wang Changying Zhang Jinta Wen Liandong</p>
<p>Xue Wenxiu</p>
<p>▲Lack of Stamina: In the beginning, Jiaoda's momentum was extremely high, so within ten minutes, they had already scored two goals. It is a pity that they lacked stamina and could not support it when their momentum waned. Goalkeeper Fan Jiaxun was nimble and commendable, and the two defenders were also quite steady. Shen Guanlan ran tirelessly, making great contributions. Forward Wan Xianghua was indeed extraordinary, but Fu Jen's defense was too strict, preventing him from fully displaying his skills. It was already a rare achievement. Xue Wenxiu's ball skills were very high, repaying evil with kindness, which is commendable. The whole team used many small passes, which were very skilled and unmatched by Fu Jen. It is a pity that individual techniques were not as organized as Fu Jen's.</p>
<p>▲King of North China Fu Jen: Wang Yumin was very steady, truly a rare talent in North China. Defenders Fu Xinqiu and Yang Puzhi were two iron gates, without any mistakes. The three center-backs were all excellent. Tang Guoliang intercepted in the middle, Lin Songfa commanded the three armies, and Li Fenglou monitored Wan Xianghua, preventing him from moving, making the greatest contribution. Forward Zhang Zhizhen deserves the top credit, giving an unprecedented brilliant performance, receiving corner kicks, perfectly suited to the goal. Wang Jingxi ran quickly and was generally good. Lian Yixun, Li Hongzhong, and Wu You'an formed a cohesive unit, passing the ball skillfully. The only one who failed was Lin Jianpeng. If the frontcourt could respond to the enemy with the backcourt formation, they would have gained even more. During the break, the strategist Wu Yanzhang gave instructions face-to-face, making use of corner kicks to pass the ball, which actually succeeded. The strategist's plan also made a great contribution. In this battle, the veteran Ye Delu did not play due to illness, which inevitably reduced the color.</p>

<h3>Sino-British Communication</h3>
<p>— Lu Bing</p>
<p>Direct communication between Shanghai and London, through the efforts of the International Telecommunications Bureau and the International Radio Station staff, preparations have long been completed, and the trial has been very smooth. It has been decided to officially open at the beginning of the month and open for communication. From now on, the International Radio Station created by our country's Ministry of Communications (originally there were ten lines to Europe, America, and Asia, and now one more line has been added) will have direct contact with major cities around the world for telecommunications. Incoming and outgoing telegrams can be reached in an instant, which not only facilitates overseas Chinese businessmen but also enhances foreign relations. It is a special event in the history of transportation in our country this year that is worthy of memorial. The world is a large commercial market. In order to compete and contend in this commercial market, improving domestic products and developing foreign trade are certainly urgent tasks; however, in reality, without an independent foreign communication organization for direct communication, financial news and market price profits and losses will not only be manipulated, but also be slow to help in an emergency; therefore, countries often organize communication in the places where they do business, as a prelude to it, the reason can be deeply thought about. People in our country have long felt the aggression of foreign forces and deeply know the importance of promoting domestic goods and improving products. At the same time, it is especially urgent to promote sales overseas in order to gain a position in international trade. The Ministry of Communications, seeing this, is striving to expand international communication and assist in the process. With the effectiveness already seen, trade will naturally increase. This International Radio Station has a great relationship with the national economy and the people's livelihood. Furthermore, international communication is no less than a foreign mouthpiece. In the past, it was bound by treaties and monopolized by foreign merchants, but now it is independently managed, and the scope of communication covers the world. It can be seen that no matter what kind of business, once you are determined and follow it up with struggle, even if you encounter difficulties, the result will eventually overcome all difficulties and lead to success. The operation of the International Radio Station is a special example. Now, in the sound of Sino-British communication, I write this based on my thoughts.</p>
<h3>Research on the Issue of Price Reduction for Domestic Foreign-Language Encrypted Telegrams Yuncheng</h3>
<p>Foreign-language encrypted telegrams are divided into two types, A and B. Type A is limited to ten letters per word, and Type B is limited to five letters per word. These encrypted telegrams have no meaning and are difficult to pronounce. Telegraph office and radio station staff find it extremely difficult to transmit them, especially Type A encrypted telegrams, which contain too many letters per word, making them impossible to memorize. Even if the rate is lowered, errors still inevitably occur. Therefore, telecommunications authorities in various countries have long proposed to abolish Type A encrypted telegrams. Finally, at the International Telecommunications Conference held in Madrid, Spain, the capital, the year before last, it was decided to abolish international Type A encrypted telegrams from January 1 this year. Our country's Ministry of Communications believed that this measure would increase the speed and accuracy of telegram delivery and would benefit both the public and telegraph offices. Therefore, it decided to abolish domestic Type A encrypted telegrams at the same time, and all international and domestic foreign-language encrypted telegrams would be limited to a maximum of five letters per word. However, according to international telegraph regulations, encrypted telegrams are charged at 60% of the plain language rate. However, the Ministry of Communications now stipulates that domestic foreign-language encrypted telegrams are still charged at the plain language rate. Therefore, a considerable number of merchants believe that the Ministry of Communications' treatment of domestic and international telegrams is unfair and request that domestic foreign-language encrypted telegrams also be charged according to the international encrypted telegram method, with a price reduction. I, for one, believe that the Ministry of Communications has been actively promoting its policy of facilitating public communication and reducing the burden on the people in the telecommunications sector for more than a year and is sincerely determined to do so. Why has it not reduced the price of domestic foreign-language encrypted telegrams this time? This is a problem worthy of study.</p>
<p>According to my investigation and statistics, the number of domestic foreign-language encrypted telegrams sent each year is no more than 800,000 words, which is a very small portion of the total number of words in various telegrams. Even if the fees are reduced by 40% in accordance with the international telegram method, the annual loss would only be sixty to seventy thousand yuan. Judging from the Ministry of Communications' recent policies, it does not seem to be unwilling to do so. This is evidenced by the fact that the Ministry of Communications has been able to implement the reduction of fees for Chinese telegram addresses alone, which will result in an annual loss of 400,000 yuan in telegraph fees, and the reduction of prices for express telegrams, which will result in a loss of 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Therefore, it can be asserted that the reason why the Ministry of Communications has stipulated that domestic foreign-language encrypted telegrams should still be charged at full price is definitely not because it is concerned about the loss of expenses, but that there must be other important reasons. Then what is the reason? According to the Ministry of Communications, there are several reasons: (1) Domestic and international pricing standards are different. The standards for setting domestic telegram prices are fundamentally different from international telegram prices. For example, the distance between Nanjing and Beiping is roughly equal to the distance between Nanjing and Nagasaki. However, a foreign-language telegram sent from Nanjing to Beiping costs only 20 cents per word, while one sent to Nagasaki costs 1 yuan and 25 cents per word, a difference of up to six times. It can be seen that domestic prices cannot be compared with international prices at all. (2) Comparison of domestic foreign-language encrypted telegrams and Chinese encrypted telegrams. The current domestic telegram prices have been in place for a long time. Chinese encrypted telegrams are charged at 20 cents per word, with four or five characters per word, and are considered fair. The new foreign-language encrypted telegrams consist of five foreign-language letters per word, and the labor and materials consumed during transmission are actually more than Chinese encrypted telegrams, but the price is the same as Chinese encrypted telegrams, which is already slightly cheaper. If the price is reduced by 40% in accordance with the international telegram method, with a fee of 12 cents per word, it would be too unfair to senders of Chinese encrypted telegrams. After all, most of the people sending foreign-language encrypted telegrams in China are foreign merchants, while most of those using Chinese codes are domestic merchants. The Ministry of Communications should not treat foreigners more favorably than its own people.</p>
<p>(3) Comparison of Foreign-Language Encrypted Telegrams and Plain Text Telegrams</p>
<p>One word in a foreign-language encrypted telegram can replace dozens of words in a plain text telegram. For example, according to the ABC Telegraphic Code, the word OPKAHL represents the plain language "Goods advised To be delivered free of duty and all charges collect duty forward but debit us with delivery charges to the nearest railway station, Reference No. (1)" etc., twenty-seven characters, not including punctuation marks. Now, it is only charged at the price of one word for plain text, which can be said to be extremely low. If the price is further reduced by 40% in accordance with the plain text price, it would be difficult to justify it to the general public sending plain text foreign-language telegrams. If it is said that each word in an encrypted telegram has only five letters, while a word in a plain text telegram can have as many as fifteen letters, it should be noted that many words in foreign-language telegrams have only one or two letters. According to the research of experts from various countries, the average length of each word in a foreign-language telegram is only five or six letters.</p>
<p>(4) For the Sake of Uniformity of Domestic Pricing</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications strives for simple and uniform domestic pricing. For example, Chinese codes are charged at a uniform rate of 10 cents per word, regardless of whether they are sent within the province or to other provinces, and Chinese encrypted codes or foreign-language codes are charged double this rate. In this way, it is very convenient for telegraph offices and senders to calculate the telegraph fees. If a separate fee reduction method is formulated for foreign-language encrypted telegrams, it will inevitably make domestic pricing more complicated, which does not seem appropriate.</p>
<p>In short, over the past year, the spirit of the authorities of the Ministry of Communications to improve telecommunications and transportation and the sincerity of their emphasis on public interests have been fully demonstrated by facts and recognized by the majority of the people. The Ministry of Communications must have given detailed consideration and overall planning to the method of charging for domestic foreign-language encrypted telegrams before the event, and felt that it must be handled in this way in order to be fair and appropriate. Its motive is definitely not to be stingy with the annual telegraph fee of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan and disregard the wishes of the senders. Therefore, although some merchants have expressed dissatisfaction with the current method of charging for domestic foreign-language encrypted telegrams, they have completely understood it after the Ministry of Communications has provided an explanation.</p>
<h3>Overview of Mobile Radio Telephony</h3>
<p>— Chen Xianding</p>
<p>In practice, radio telephony can only use amplitude-modulated waves and cannot use attenuated waves, although it is possible to use attenuated waves with multiple oscillations (10,000 times per minute). Since the invention of the Parker transmitter, various European and American countries have conducted trials of this radio telephony on ship radio stations. The results were very good. Initially, the microphone, or multiple microphones installed in parallel, were directly installed in the antenna circuit. The antenna circuit was inductively coupled with a closed oscillating circuit equipped with a Parker generator. Subsequently, during the European War, due to the invention of the vacuum tube, radio telephony made considerable progress. The power of the carrier wave of this vacuum tube transmitter, recently used for radio telephony on ship radio stations, is only from five watts to five hundred watts.</p>
<p>From 1920 to 1929, various countries used intermediate waves for this trial. The results of simplex circuits were very satisfactory. However, duplex circuits, where the transmitter and receiver operate simultaneously, were very difficult. This is because, as shown in the first diagram,</p>
<p>initially, there was no way to avoid mutual interference between the transmitter and receiver. Because in ordinary radio transmission and reception, the positions of the transmitting antenna and receiving antenna must be far apart to minimize mutual interference. However, on a ship, space is limited, how can one arrange them arbitrarily? However, there are two points to pay attention to in mobile radio telephony: first, landline telephone users must use coastal radio stations as intermediaries, as shown in the second diagram.</p>
<p>Terminator SB Amplifier (1) Amplifier (2)</p>
<p>Amplifier (1) RTRR Echo Canceller Amplifier (2) Receiver Transmitter can then be connected to the ship radio station. Second, only one telephone on the ship is sufficient to handle simultaneous talking or listening for passengers. With these two points as a basis for technical improvement, the shipboard equipment is greatly simplified. The electrical equipment of the receiving section is completely isolated from the electrical equipment of the transmitting section. On land, the intermediary problem has been resolved since the invention of the terminator. The signals or interference received by the land receiver will no longer be transmitted by the transmitter and disturb shipboard reception. The installation situation is shown in the first diagram.</p>
<p>This method also requires the installation of an echo canceller (echo extinguisher) on land because radio telephone calls travel long distances and the transmission time is longer. The balance accuracy of the land equipment is bound to change from time to time. A small portion of the conversation is often transmitted back to the ship, and there is a risk of mutual interference due to echo. The echo canceller is sufficient to eliminate this obstacle. This device is voice-activated. When one side is talking, the sound coming from the other side is completely eliminated, and the echo current is absolutely prevented from passing through.</p>
<p>The second diagram shows a simple arrangement of the echo canceller. This device is connected to the grid converter. When the call current is transmitted from the ship to the terminator, it is amplified by the receiver amplifier.</p>
<p>A portion of the current is then processed by the echo canceller R│T (the function of the echo canceller is equivalent to a rectifier). At that time, the DC negative voltage plays a major role in the grid, and the transmitter amplifier is able to prevent the call current from reflecting back to the ship from the terminator. Another echo canceller T·R is similarly connected to the receiver amplifier (1) when the land user speaks. This echo canceller functions to eliminate all interference from the sea surface and from the station itself, transmitted by the ship radio station's receiver. It does not affect the echo canceller R·T or the transmitting amplifier, nor does it transmit this interference back to the other party's land station through the terminator. The land user can eliminate the above interference in the same way when speaking. The shipboard transmitting and receiving equipment should be completely electrically isolated to prevent induction due to reaction coupling, which would cause the receiver to squeak. However, because the ship's position is small, the transmitting antenna and receiving antenna must be very close, and the inductive effect between them is still difficult to completely avoid. The telephone itself has four wires, which already form a radio circuit, and its own induction is also difficult to eliminate. In addition, the fading effect is particularly noticeable in short waves. For these reasons, the stability of radio telephony cannot be compared with that of four-wire circuit long-distance telephones.</p>
<p>To remove these difficulties, an eliminator adjuster and a reaction eliminator must be used. The principle of the eliminator adjuster is as follows: the lower the sound received, the higher the receiving amplification, and vice versa. The method is to use the current generated at the output of the receiver and connect it to the grid of the high amplifier. In this way, the reception is long, then the grid is adjusted by obtaining attenuation resistance. In practice, the adjustment speed is extremely high and not easy to feel.</p>
<p>Ordinary elimination adjusters can satisfy communication. However, it is best to install a reaction eliminator on land to achieve perfection. One is to prevent self-induction, and the other is to remedy the situation when the elimination effect is too strong, that is, when the adjuster loses its effectiveness. The main power of the reaction eliminator is the same as that of the echo canceller. When one side is talking, the function prevents interference from the other side. Whether in talking or in silence, neither side will generate self-induction.</p>
<h3>"Wheat" and "Alkali"</h3>
<p>— Observer</p>
<p>Recently, I read a report in a Shanghai newspaper, stating in essence that the Construction Department of a certain province received an order from the Ministry of Industry to investigate the quantity of wheat produced in various places under its jurisdiction and the situation of its transportation and sales. Therefore, the department sent telegrams to various counties to handle the matter. Unexpectedly, the "wheat" 7796 in the telegram was mistakenly translated as "alkali" 7769. As a result, many counties replied, "This county does not produce alkali." After checking, the telegraph bureau had no mistakes, the mistake was the translator of the Construction Department: because the translator was not familiar with the telegraph code, he unintentionally translated the important word "wheat" in the text into "alkali." Although only the last two Arabic numerals were reversed, a slight error resulted in a great difference.</p>
<p>Chinese telegrams use four Arabic numerals to represent a character. Those who are familiar with the translation do not need to look up the code word by word, and can translate it into writing without any errors. If it is a novice, they often look up the code for each word, which is not only time-consuming but also easy to omit and make mistakes. It is now heard that the Ministry of Communications is studying phonetic telegrams and preparing to implement them. This move seems to be able to remedy the above-mentioned shortcomings. Before it is implemented, if you want to send a telegram and you are not proficient in translating telegrams, you may as well entrust the telegraph bureau to translate it for you, which costs very little and is also responsible for accuracy.</p>
<h3>Are Telegrams Being Reduced in Price?</h3>
<p>— Cuifu</p>
<p>According to the Ministry's order, starting from January 1st of this year, express telegrams will be charged twice the normal rate, and the name and address of the recipient of Chinese telegrams, if not exceeding fifteen characters, will be counted as five characters, which can save ten characters' worth of fees. In other words, telegram price reductions have now been implemented.</p>
<p>There have always been two opinions on the issue of telegram prices: the first opinion says: telegrams should be reduced in price; the second opinion says: telegrams should be increased in price. The reasons for each opinion are as follows: (A) Telegrams are a state-run enterprise, and its purpose is to communicate culture and serve the people, just like the state running schools. It is not for the purpose of profit, and even if there is a loss, it should be compensated by the government. (B) In the minds of the general public, telegram prices are too expensive. Except for merchants, the common people never send telegrams lightly unless they encounter major events such as illness or death, which is clear evidence. (C) The world is currently in an economic panic, and the national economy is declining. Cities and industries often use price reductions to attract customers. Therefore, in order to adapt to this urgent environment, there is indeed a need for price reductions, etc. The reasons for the second opinion are as follows: (A) The losses of the telecommunications administration are already considerable, and there are no funds for repairing lines and purchasing materials. If prices are reduced, it is feared that the number of telegrams will not increase, but the telegraph fees will be sharply reduced, which will inevitably lead to even greater losses, which cannot be remedied. (B) If prices are greatly reduced, so that sending telegrams is like sending ordinary mail quick letters, the telegraph service will suddenly increase, and the lines will inevitably be overcrowded, and manpower will not be sufficient, which is a difficult problem. (C) The postal service and telegrams are both state-run enterprises. The postage was increased once a few years ago, and there has been no adverse reaction. So why not increase telegram prices? The two opinions are divided and have been at odds for more than a day!</p>
<p>Now, with a thunderous sound, our government resolutely followed the opinion of reducing prices. This kind of courage is rare among those who have been in charge of telecommunications in recent years, and it also shows their eagerness to facilitate the people and promote business. This is what our people should deeply recognize. Furthermore, there is a special feature in this price reduction method, namely, the section on the name and address of the recipient. Because telegram senders always try to reduce the number of characters, regardless of whether the telegram is easy to deliver. As a result, the recipient often has a surname but no first name, a neighborhood but no street, and a street but no town. To list the shortcomings, it is endless. And what is the loss of its inability to be delivered properly? Not only does the telegraph bureau waste public telegrams to reply, but the telegram itself also loses its effectiveness in terms of time. Now, the method is updated, and the sender can explain as much detail as possible within the scope of fifteen characters, and completely eliminate the previous concerns of undeliverable telegrams. Isn't that great! This is also what our people should understand.</p>
<p>Someone may say: "According to the regulations stipulated in this price reduction charter, apart from telegrams in foreign languages, if we use the commonly used two-character store name as the recipient, such as 'Hangzhou Dacheng...', it is usually counted as four characters and can also be delivered. Now, according to the new rules, it must be counted as five characters, which means that there is a name for reducing fees, but in fact, it is increasing fees. Why is this?" The answer is: The telegram address, except for registered ones, must be detailed according to the regulations, so that the telegraph bureau or telegraph station does not need to inquire or visit, and can deliver it directly. As in the above example of using the four characters "Hangzhou Dacheng" as the address, it is too brief and does not conform to the regulations. In the past, various bureaus and stations accepted this type of telegram, which was a compromise, but there were many abuses. If there are two merchants named "Dacheng" in Hangzhou, or if the "Dacheng" is an unknown merchant, the telegram may be misdelivered or undeliverable. If it is said that this kind of address must be a well-known merchant in the local area, with many telegrams back and forth, so there is no need to worry that the bureau or station will not be able to deliver it, it is not known that since it is a well-known merchant with many telegrams back and forth, its address must have been registered in the local bureau or station, and the sender does not use its registered characters to replace the address, which can save even more telegraph fees.</p>
<p>Someone may also say: Although this time it is said to reduce fees, the extent of the reduction still cannot satisfy our people's hopes. The answer is: If the government's price reduction measures are supported by the society and the people, and everyone makes full use of telegrams, so that this plan is effective, then continued price reductions are a matter of course!</p>
<p>This month, the direct connection was achieved, and the British report was in hand. Sino-British</p>
<h3>A Comprehensive View of Sino-British Communications</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>In order to develop international communications, the Ministry of Communications signed a contract with Marconi Company of the United Kingdom two years ago to purchase wireless equipment, and at the same time signed a Sino-British telecommunications contract with the Imperial Communications Company of the United Kingdom. In the past year or so, it has spared no effort in carrying out telecommunications matters: such as borrowing Geng funds to pay for equipment fees; purchasing land to lay the foundation for the station site; sending personnel abroad to practice to gain advanced knowledge; all kinds of news have been seen in newspapers, and have long been noticed by the people of the country. Now the radio station has been completed! The interns have returned to the country! The equipment has been installed! The trial telecommunications have been successful! And it is scheduled to officially open direct telecommunications on February 3rd. It has lasted for more than a year and cost millions of dollars, which can be said to be the largest construction project of the Ministry of Communications in the past two years. The significance of Sino-British communications is important and great! Now, I will try to briefly describe it in terms of various aspects: (1) Since China and the United Kingdom signed the Treaty of Nanjing, China opened five ports for trade, and the door was opened. Later, France, Germany, the United States, Japan, Italy, and other countries followed suit and signed commercial treaties with China, thus changing from a closed and conservative country to a arena where international forces competed. Every move of mine affects international politics; and every word of international politics is related to domestic politics, like a ring without end, like a response to a sound. Among the great powers, the United Kingdom was the first to trade with China; and the United Kingdom is the closest to China. Looking at the rise and fall of the price of Chinese public debt in London, it is the standard for trade with China in major cities, and the "Parliament" discussing the China issue is watched by world politicians. The relationship between China and the United Kingdom is greater than that of any European country in terms of both politics and economics. Now, the two major countries of Europe and Asia communicate directly, meet face to face, and treat each other sincerely. This is of great significance in terms of the friendship between China and the United Kingdom and even in terms of world politics and economics.</p>
<p>(2) China has been bound by unequal treaties for eighty years, and the telecommunications industry has also been restricted by the contracts of foreign submarine cable companies, and has completely lost the freedom of international communications. In recent years, the establishment of international radio stations by the Ministry of Communications has successively communicated with Hong Kong, Macau, Manila, Saigon, Java, San Francisco, Berlin, Paris, Geneva, Moscow, and other places. International telecommunications are developing day by day. When the submarine cable contracts have all expired, foreign merchants began to submit and signed new contracts with us. The submarine cable company on Edward Road in Shanghai became an affiliated organization of the International Telecommunications Bureau. However, if 60% of the international telecommunications between China and the United Kingdom do not have a direct circuit to connect, it would be a pity. Now, the completion of Sino-British communications is tantamount to completely breaking the shackles of telecommunications for the past eighty years. This can be greatly emphasized in terms of national sovereignty.</p>
<p>(3) According to Article 2 of Chapter 2 of the Telegraph Regulations attached to the Madrid International Telecommunications Convention: "Where the telegrams between the telegraph bureaus are continuous or extremely busy, direct communication circuits should be used as far as possible to connect them, and the number of circuits should be sufficient to meet the needs of the business." The frequency of Sino-British telecommunications is as mentioned above, far beyond that of other countries. In the past, it took 20 minutes to transfer through the circuits of the Great Eastern or Great Northern Submarine Cable Company. Recently, it took 15 minutes to transfer through the radio circuits between Shanghai and Paris or between Shanghai and Berlin. Now, direct Sino-British telecommunications only takes 2 minutes (see a glimpse of the International Radio Station in the fourth issue of this journal). This breaks a new record in the history of Sino-British communications.</p>
<p>In summary, the above three points are the great significance of Sino-British communications. On the one hand, we celebrate the increasing friendship between China and the United Kingdom to promote world peace; on the other hand, we celebrate the gradual recovery of China's telecommunications sovereignty to strive for national will. As for the success of long-distance land communications and the development of international telegraph business, we deeply admire the foresight of the transportation authorities and the efforts of the radio station colleagues.</p>
<h3>Bi-Weekly News</h3>
<p>Public telegrams are specially allowed to be free of charge</p>
<p>When telegrams are transmitted, there are errors, so error correction personnel are set up. After the telegram is sent, the paper strip and the telegraph base are checked again. If an error is found, a telegram is sent immediately to correct it, so that the accuracy of the telegram is more guaranteed; but busy telegraph bureaus often have more than a thousand telegrams coming and going and being transferred every day, so it is difficult to check them one by one, so only the telegrams sent and received by each machine can be checked in rotation. Occasionally, when the telegram is not checked and the telegram has an error, the recipient should immediately bring the incoming telegram to the telegraph bureau for inquiry. (For convenience, you can also inquire by phone, but you must explain the number in the upper right corner of the incoming telegram and where it was sent from.) When inquiring, telegraph fees should be paid in advance according to the regulations. If there are two words in the telegram that are doubtful, please ask the telegraph bureau to inquire, and you must prepay the telegraph fees for two words. If the result of the inquiry is that the telegraph bureau did make a mistake due to negligence, then the telegraph fees for these two words can be refunded. If the error is due to the sender's unclear writing, the telegraph fees cannot be refunded. It is now heard that the Ministry of Communications, in order to thoroughly facilitate the telegram-sending public, has specially allowed this inquiry public telegram to be free of charge from February 1st; however, the words inquired should be limited to what is necessary, and should not be excessive, so as not to hinder the business.</p>
<h3>Improvement of Telecommunications in Jiangbei, Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>There are quite a few telegrams back and forth in Jiangbei, Jiangsu Province, but due to the relationship of telegraph lines, each telegram has to be transferred several times, so the transmission is not fast enough. It is recently heard that the Ministry of Communications, in order to make Jiangbei telecommunications faster, will try to free up a line between Shanghai and Qingjiangpu to communicate directly. In the future, telegrams back and forth between Shanghai and Suhang in Jiangbei will only need to be transferred through Qingjiangpu and Shanghai bureaus, which should be extremely fast. Even telegrams back and forth with Pingjinhan and other places will also be transferred by the Shanghai bureau, which will definitely be twice as fast as before.</p>
<h3>Printing and Distributing a Summary of the New Telegram Price Reduction Regulations</h3>
<p>In the past year, the Ministry of Communications has strived to commercialize and popularize telegrams, so the newly formulated various fee reduction regulations are extremely desirable for the people to know. It is now heard that the Ministry of Communications, in order to facilitate the public to check, has specially printed and compiled 50,000 copies of a single booklet summarizing various fee reduction regulations for distribution to all sectors for consultation. This single booklet also includes the "Notes on Telegram Inquiries" published in issues 123 of this journal, so it is very useful to have this booklet. In addition, the new regulations have made many changes to the method of calculating the number of words in foreign language telegrams compared with the old regulations, so the Ministry of Communications has also printed a single booklet of "Calculation Method of the Number of Words in Foreign Language Telegrams" and attached an English explanation for foreigners to request. The above two single booklets will be printed soon, and can be obtained free of charge from the local telegraph bureau or telegraph station, or can be requested from this newspaper by letter.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in Wireless Telephony in Various Countries (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Wang Dachun</p>
<p>In the past year or two, the development of the telecommunications industry in various countries has been the highest record for wireless telephony. Among the latest opened wireless telephones, the important ones are (1) direct wireless telephone circuits from Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay in South America to Australia. This circuit expands Australia's international communications, allowing all ports in Australia and New Zealand to open international calls to reach the world. (2) Chile directly connects to Spain, and then from Spain, uses the existing wireless telephone to the Canary Islands and Mallorca in the Atlantic Ocean, making North and South America and Northern Europe connected to each other through the connection of the original land lines and wireless telegraphs. (3) The wireless telephone of Colombia in South America has also been connected to Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, as well as the international wireless telephone stations of the Argentine International Radio Company in Europe. (4) The inter-island wireless telephone (Inter Island Service) from the United States directly to Hawaii and the Bermuda Islands has also been completed recently.</p>
<p>The continuous transmission of wireless telephones, called Tandem Circuits, has recently opened calls between North America and Java, passing through two relay stations, one in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and one in Berlin, Germany. The connecting wireless telephone circuits from Java to Australia, to Sumatra, and to Siam are opened here. Many countries' landline telecommunications use wireless telephones to open international calls, such as (1) the British Empire's telephone network, which is now connected to Indochina, Morocco, and New Zealand. (2) North and South America are connected to Romania and Estonia. (3) Sweden is connected to Indochina, Siam, Java, and Australia. (4) Finland is connected to Java. (5) Belgium is connected to Siam. (6) Germany is connected to Indochina. (7) Latvia is connected to Siam and Java. (8) The Czech Republic and Luxembourg are connected to Siam and Indochina. (9) The Netherlands and Hungary are connected to Indochina. (10) Austria is connected to Siam and Indochina. (11) Switzerland is connected to Morocco, Indochina, and Siam. These are all using wireless telephones. The wireless telephone between Italy and Sardinia has also been opened. The telephone network of the Brazilian telephone company in South America also uses wireless telephones to connect to the telephone networks of the United States, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. It is now proceeding to connect to European countries, and it can be opened in the shortest possible time. As for the wireless telephone stations between the United States and Japan, they have also been built and established. There are also plans to install wireless telephones in the United Kingdom and India, Africa, and Egypt.</p>

<h3>Our Country's Factories Under the Massive Dumping of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>— Yang Mang</p>
<p>Recently, the sales of national goods in our country have been increasingly hindered due to the massive dumping of foreign goods. The biggest difficulty for factory operators is the sales problem. Recently, although the national government and the public have repeatedly worked hard to promote the national goods movement, the dumping of foreign goods on our country is still increasing day by day, especially the dumping of Japanese goods, which is using planned and organized methods and being controlled by the Japanese government to carry out large-scale aggression. In addition to dumping a large number of goods into China, it has recently changed to a policy of opening industries in China, bypassing tariff barriers, and using our country's low wages and abundant raw materials to manufacture a large number of industrial products needed by our people for dumping. Their products are all impersonated as national goods, and even experts can hardly distinguish them. The most attention-grabbing point is Shanghai, the center of our industry. According to a recent survey by the industry authorities, such as light bulb factories, enamel factories, iron factories, thermos bottle factories, textile machinery manufacturing plants, hat factories, rubber factories, metal finishing plants, dyeing factories, electrical machinery factories, umbrella factories, engine manufacturing plants, oil lamp factories, wire factories, tinplate factories, leather factories, ceramic factories, pharmaceutical factories, canning factories, etc., are all being added, from adding one factory to five or six factories. From Shanghai to North China, South China, and the Yangtze River Basin, the sales of their products are not only targeted at our country, but also at Nanyang, India, and the Near East. Our factories under the dumping of Japanese goods, it is useless to be afraid, and it is useless to seek help from the government. It is better to ask for help from yourself than from others. At present, the only way to save ourselves is through the following four methods:</p>
<p>(1) Each factory should quickly change its past policy of infighting among the same industry and jealousy among the same industry, unite together, and focus on improving the quality of products, reducing costs, and finding ways to promote sales. If you continue to kill each other, you will benefit the enemy and be laughed at by them.</p>
<p>(2) If each factory needs machines and there are domestic goods available, do not buy foreign goods or enemy goods, which will lead to suicide. Especially in the textile industry, pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>(3) Each factory should quickly pay attention to the selection of professionals and find technical talents to ensure that everything is done by the right person and everyone is qualified, so as to form a well-prepared and orderly factory that can gain a foothold in the current industrial world.</p>
<p>(4) Each factory should quickly adopt a sincere and steady attitude and work closely with the banking community to obtain real support.</p>

<h3>May Women Awaken the National Soul!</h3>
<p>— Southern Beauty</p>
<p>Charming eyes,</p>
<p>Eyebrows new;</p>
<p>Snowy skin accompanies jade countenance,</p>
<p>Elegant attire flaunts modernity;</p>
<p>How sad that lovely women are soulless!</p>
<p>Our souls are lost! How can I say this? If you look at any aspect of society, how many things are created by our own minds and abilities? How many things are not subject to external forces, being manipulated and tossed about? The biggest and most immediate thing, for example, "international technological cooperation," our production and construction undertakings cannot be carried out without foreign capital; they cannot be started without foreign technical personnel; they cannot be initiated without purchasing foreign machinery and tools. It goes without saying that we are "using talents from Chu for Jin," as long as it is not "borrowing a knife to kill someone," but using them for production and construction undertakings, any emerging country in the world will inevitably adopt this strategy. Moreover, our late Premier had already given us this guidance. Furthermore, regarding smaller matters, bourgeois citizens, whether male or female, whether in business, industry, or politics, the younger and more handsome or beautiful they are, the more "modernized" and "luxurious" their clothing, food, and utensils become. In other words, the more "Westernized" they become. There are plenty of domestic goods available, but in the subconscious of every "lovable person of the era," there seems to be an inherent belief that "foreign goods are beautiful, exquisite, hygienic, and convenient to use... Chinese goods are crude, clumsy, unclean, and not durable..." As a result, many speculative factories and speculative merchants actually label their domestic products, intended for sale to their own countrymen, with foreign trademarks and styles, hoping to sell them at higher prices. Don't you think that this kind of psychologically abnormal social reality indicates that a large part of our souls has already been lost? Speaking of our women, women's love of beauty surpasses that of men; the object of women's adornment is naturally "to please the one who appreciates her"; just like young men in their youth try their best to show off and please in order to win the favor of young women. If you try to analyze the psychology of modern women, the standard modern woman, you will almost always come to this conclusion: "Domestic goods are what I desire, and modernity is also what I desire, but I cannot have both: I will give up domestic goods and choose modernity." For the sake of modernity, hair must be permed, lips must be rouged, shoes must have high heels, clothes must be Western-style, and cosmetics to enhance fair skin and beautiful features must be imported; beautiful women indeed float and desire to become immortals, and the souls of their own bodies, their families, and their country also follow them into the void, riding the wind, never to be called back! Lately, I have been living on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai. Besides hearing the bugle calls from the Japanese garrison in Shanghai every morning at dawn, the sound of early patrols, and seeing waves of heavily armed Japanese soldiers, and fleets of armored vehicles rushing back and forth as if preparing for battle, I can fully appreciate the "cherry blossom ladies" coming and going on the trams and on the streets. Strangely enough! Whether they are old or young, almost all of them have high hairstyles, large sleeves, wear face masks, and drag wooden clogs. From top to toe, almost their entire style, the entire set of materials, is made of their own domestic products. I think this small point is enough to demonstrate their "Yamato soul"!</p>
<p>What about our "Chinese soul"? I wish our women would awaken it!</p>
<p>Discussion on National Goods</p>
<h3>My Views on Establishing National Goods Companies in Various Regions</h3>
<p>— Bingxian</p>
<p>The movement for national goods, the dumping of foreign goods, and the struggle against enemy goods have brewed a multi-faceted competitive situation in the commercial arena in the past two years, containing international struggles. The facts are unfolding. Thanks to the enthusiastic advocacy of national goods activists in the past year, considerable gains have been made, but this state is abnormal. Although national goods have gained a superior trend in this struggle in urban areas due to the advocacy of the general public, they are still subject to various obstacles in the interior, and cannot be developed. Now, in order to eliminate this abnormal state, major national goods factories have jointly undertaken, together with national goods activists, a plan to establish 24 national goods companies across the country, and have specially requested banks to adjust financing, leveraging collective wisdom and efforts to recover the domestic markets that have been lost. This undoubtedly extends the battle lines, expands strength, and attacks the foreign goods that have penetrated deeply into the inland markets. Investigating foreign goods in the interior, like in the cities, almost every household has traces of them, especially enemy goods. Although there are various other reasons for their rampant nature, the lack of direct sales agencies for domestic goods in the interior is a major cause. Now that national goods companies are established in various places, the conflicts with the original foreign goods merchants, and serious conflicts of interest, are inevitable. At the same time, the final struggle of enemy goods and foreign goods is also expected. Although the outcome of this struggle cannot be predicted, one point must be deeply considered by those who organize national goods companies: strictly prevent the foreign goods industry from making a last-ditch effort, and devote all its efforts to promoting sales in rural areas. The establishment of national goods companies in various regions is originally intended to recover the inland markets. However, the plan is to establish them in the metropolises still located in the interior. It must be known that the main base of general consumers in the interior is not in the cities but mostly in the countryside. From the perspective of those who are planning to establish national goods companies, it is advisable to choose prosperous areas for business, but this gives foreign goods merchants an opportunity to take advantage of. They grasp this point, and use general rural peddlers to continue to import foreign goods into the countryside. In this way, the more national goods develop in the cities, the more rampant foreign goods become in the countryside. The main purpose is to eliminate this abnormal state, but as a result, this state becomes even more abnormal. Therefore, when establishing companies, it is necessary to take this into account, and in addition to the company's retail business, also engage in rural sales business, so that it may be possible to truly recover the domestic market!</p>
<p>Introduction to National Goods</p>
<h3>National Goods Year for Women and Cosmetics</h3>
<p>— Xueyou</p>
<p>In the dormitory, seven or eight of us share a room, and after 9 p.m. every night, it is time for us to talk. The focus of the conversation often centers on cosmetics, which brand is the best (naturally all domestic goods). After everyone agrees, we all adopt it unanimously. Compatriots, I would like to contribute to your knowledge, everyone should adopt domestic goods unanimously, and not send money to foreign countries, to make them strong, while causing domestic industry to gradually decline.</p>
<p>(1) Face powder | Which brand is the best, and does not harm the skin, this is a very important question. If the selection is not proper, it is better not to apply it. Many people like to apply French Simon face powder, and the Chinese Invincible brand Butterfly powder can replace it. Another popular product, unanimously recommended by Hollywood stars, Max Fotepouder, is also manufactured by Wang Hanlun Beauty Salon in China, and can replace it. I think these two are the best. (2) Cold cream | If you like to apply the Three Flowers brand, you can replace it with Chinese Butterfly Cream. Pacific Pharmacy's Ruler Cream can replace Mianyou (Mianyou's sales are now very alarming), Daughter Cream Baby Face, Queen Cream and Kwong Sang Hong's cold cream are all good, and can be used as the best foundation.</p>
<p>(3) Rouge | The biggest drawback of rouge in domestic goods is that the red color does not last long. After half an hour or exposure to the sun, it immediately fades. I hope that the promoters of domestic goods will pay attention to this point and make some improvements, which is what we hope for. Often on the street, I see many modern girls with yellowish cheeks, friends! This is your mistake in choosing colors. We know that the cheeks should be as red as apples, and never yellowish like orange peels!</p>
<p>(4) Lipstick | Don't think that imported products are good. I invite you to go to a domestic goods company to buy a domestic lipstick, which is only half the price of imported products, and you will be satisfied after using it. (5) Toothpaste | Samsung, Clean White, Chang'e in the Moon, White Jade, Spearmint, all kinds of toothpaste are very good.</p>
<p>(6) Cold cream applied before going to bed (i.e. Cold Cream) can use Samsung's "Fragrant Ze Fat." It can make your pores clean and your skin delicate. (7) Eyebrow pencil | The domestic eyebrow pencil is too soft. When used, it looks like a fake. Using an eyebrow brush can only add blackness, but cannot make the eyebrows longer. With this shortcoming, although we cannot buy domestic goods to use, we are also unwilling to buy imported products. Before this domestic eyebrow pencil is improved, we can only use willow branches, peel off the bark, burn it with fire, and then dip it in water to draw our eyebrows.</p>
<p>In short, each of us women does this. Just calculate one box of powder per person. How many women are there in China? Then you can know how great the impact of buying domestic goods is! This year is the "National Goods Year for Women." I hope that female compatriots will start by adopting domestic cosmetics first, and then extend to other areas. Because love of beauty is the nature of women!</p>
<h3>Greedy Treacherous Merchants</h3>
<p>— Mengzhao</p>
<p>The motherland has been brought to a state of distress both above and below, and everyone is poor! This is bestowed by the economic aggression of imperialism! It is also because you Chinese citizens love to buy foreign goods, and love vanity! Greed will not leave a poor life!</p>
<p>The other day, the local supplement of the Xinwen Daily published a report by a certain gentleman: saying that Japanese merchants dressed up in Chinese clothing, and feasted a large number of cotton cloth merchants at Xinghualou, with more than a hundred tables set up. The treacherous merchants went to the meeting with joy and high spirits. I really don't understand why the treacherous merchants are not afraid of the bloody smell of being close to the enemy! Greed will not leave a poor life! The rivers and mountains outside the pass have not been recovered, and the interior is being cut up by its own hands! Cold-bloodedness to this point, what else is there to say? I dare to loudly appeal to compatriots, whether it is National Goods Year or not, in our innate responsibility, pay close attention to the actions of this group of treacherous merchants, the public should sanction them, and in our own position, consistently and rigorously use national goods! Everyone, rise up!</p>

<h3>Eunuch Civilization</h3>
<p>— Gu Ming</p>
<p>Since Germany recently implemented the criminal law of eliminating reproductive function, people in our country have been uneasy, as if they felt that "the situation is gone," and they want to try their best to reverse it, which affects themselves. Originally, a nation full of all kinds of venereal diseases is very sensitive to this kind of thing, and the reason for it is obvious. Just looking at the number of advertisements for venereal disease drugs in the newspapers, and the popularity of erotic novels, one can know one or two things about it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, recently many people are willing to put a lot of effort into studying this kind of thing in the West. Mentioning many literary writers such as Baudelaire and Wilde, they do not know that they have literary works, but only know their perverted venereal diseases. China is not willing to put such research effort into it, and most of it is introduced from Japan. Originally, people who eat seafood have a stronger sexual sense, which is based on physiology. Many customs in the interior of China still retain a simple style, like a chaotic country girl. And the first person to come to the big city and destroy her is Japan. But so far, no one seems willing to study such issues: such as what methods were used in ancient palace punishments? Is it based on eugenics? When did it begin? It is very strange that a civilization of thousands of years has allowed the existence of eunuchs. Moreover, this civilization can be called "Eunuch Civilization." These four words can represent many ideas of Huang-Lao, Buddhism, and Confucianism. Its ideal is to be odorless, not to affect each other, and not to be loved or hated by anyone. Being between the two sexes, but above everything. Making people unguarded, running and disappearing in the dark like a shadow. Monks aside, Huang-Lao both talk about inaction, that is, first turning one's own emotions, instincts, and vitality into nothing, and then being able to make trouble among people and do things that ordinary people cannot. If this outlook on life is born to escape the suffering of the world, then it is not only far from "eunuch," but also not far from "corpse." Using this yardstick to measure ancient civilizations, one can know why this civilization has not developed and only seen decline.</p>
<h3>The Death of My Son</h3>
<p>— Fan Zhongyun</p>
<p>My dying son was gasping his last breath on the small bed, my wife was crying loudly by the bed, seeing this tragic scene, I felt a pang of sadness in my heart, and tears fell continuously without knowing it. Although at the same time in my mind, thoughts flashed "what does death matter, is it worth such grief," however, a kind of loving emotion, that is, the emotion between parent and child, dominated me. Regardless of the aversion to the dead that I have always held, I couldn't help but lean on him. My son's life was only fifteen months and two days old, only a very short period in my life history, but the impression he gave me was too profound. Because of my work, except for the mornings spent in sleep, I was rarely at home in the afternoon, and the evenings were my writing work time, I had no spare time to be close to my son. But his attitude towards me was even closer than towards his mother. Because his mother still had times to scold him, while I only followed his wishes. When I came home in the evening, seeing him waving at the door, before I got out of the car, he had already rushed into my arms. So I kissed him all the way, and carried him upstairs, he held my neck with one hand, and gestured while babbling with the other. The fatigue of the day was thus dissipated in the love of parent and child. The various impressions from returning home from the hospital all floated to my mind at once, like many small needles, piercing my heart. The room was also particularly large, the bed was also particularly wide, and the toys, small bed, small car, photos, etc. that could be commemorated were removed, hoping to erase the impression in my mind, but a desolate and lonely atmosphere still filled the four corners of the house, and spread throughout my mind. Tonight is so desolate! He symbolized a glimmer of life in our family, and now it has been destroyed by fate, only sadness and sorrow fill our surroundings. I remember when it was my son's tangbing feast, Free Talk was being edited by brother Liewen. Brother Hongtu, because I had independently supported a weekly magazine for three years, called him "the future warrior" in an article congratulating Free Talk. Brother Hongtu also wrote this on the package of clothing material he gave him. However, at the beginning of 1934, this weekly magazine that had lasted for more than three years was forced to stop publication due to the environment, and this "future warrior" also died prematurely at the Red Cross Hospital at 10:30 on January 29th! In this society, in this era, we should not have ideals or efforts!</p>
<h3>Monument</h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>January 28th, a day worth commemorating! When I woke up, it was quiet all around, without a sound. Lying in bed, I couldn't see the sky, and I thought that the weather outside should be gloomy and miserable... But when I opened the window, bright sunlight streamed in, bringing a slight warmth. There was no wind, and a booming tram sound broke the silence of the morning. Standing in front of the window, I took two deep breaths; I felt a little relaxed. But when I picked up the newspaper; black lines and black elegies began to sob before my eyes; as if I had returned to this day two years ago, this area was completely oppressed by the power of imperialists, and hundreds of thousands of residents, supporting the old and carrying the young, fled in panic. Airplanes, artillery, and machine guns finally came out at night, aiming at Chinese people to slaughter them!</p>
<p>The days passed quickly, and today, two years later, North Sichuan Road, where the bloody wind blew, is so peaceful; I can't see a bit of turmoil. Walking in the faint sunlight, I went out of the gate alone, and squeezed into the crowd, walking straight down. I have a heavy heart, and I have a tear that cannot fall. I am indignant at the corruption of the motherland, and my own obsession; but at the same time, I resignedly feel that what else is there in life besides trying to pursue some happiness? Contradictory heart, more and more heavy! The phonograph in the foreign goods store sent out the song Peach Blossom River, and the pedestrians on the road smiled in this decadent sound. I raised my head, I wanted to find one or two mourning half-masts in the clear sunlight; but I didn't find them until I walked to Qiujiang Road intersection. So I lowered my eyes in disappointment, only mud and orange peels were on the asphalt road, and the memorable bloodstains had long been gone. So I sighed lowly, and a Japanese naval military vehicle brushed past me. … At noon, I stood in front of a pile of ruins, facing the broken tiles and dishes, and the ruined walls. I wanted to cry a lot; let the tears that could not fall flow down on this sad day! I want to erect a monument on this ruin, and carve my memorial words on the monument with my own hands! But why are tears still left in my mind! I picked up a broken brick and trembled, when will the monument be erected?</p>
<h3>Reading the Inaugural Issue of "Literary Quarterly"</h3>
<p>— Zhong Fang</p>
<p>After reading a magazine, there will naturally be some feelings. However, it is said that thinking is okay, but if you want to publish what you think in the form of a book review, it is not good; one is that in today's world, it is said that the group of authors is very annoyed by critics, and the other is that a slight carelessness will drag down the author. For example, in the inaugural issue of "Literary Quarterly," nine novels were published. According to my after-reading feelings, I would first recommend Wu Zuxiang's "One Thousand Eight Hundred Dan," and imitate Jin Shengtan's writing style: "Exposing the dark side of feudal society, it should float when read" "Great White" But in this chaotic world of 1934, I really don't know if the label "anti-feudal" will drag down the author, so I still cancelled the Shengtan-style comments, and talk about other things. Wu Zuxiang is probably a young man who doesn't understand the world. You see that his pen can write very well, and it writes very well, but he must write a local tyrant and gentry, with everything from chickens crowing and dogs stealing, what Song family, and also write that the Song family ancestral hall has many unbearable aspects in the half-day of opening the ancestral hall on July 15th, which is too disappointing! Opening the ancestral hall is a grand event, and it should be praised and prayed for; unfortunately, Wu Zuxiang also did not consider it. However, I know that the author Wu will definitely exclaim and defend himself: "This is what I saw with my own eyes!" This is even more absurd! China is so big, there is nothing strange about it; although there are such unpleasant things as the Song Family Ancestral Hall on one side, why not have a magnificent and globally sensational (excuse my exaggeration) model ancestral hall on the other side? A smart author would never spread his family's dirty linen. And spreading it internally is even more hateful! Another person, Yu Yi, wrote a piece called "General." Just looking at the title, I always thought that this article was not about an anti-Japanese general, or about a civil war general. I didn't know that it was greatly different. This originally wrote about a fake general of the White Russians stranded in Harbin. The author's pen is also very good, writing about this self-proclaimed general's stranded person as both laughable and pitiful, and even writing about him relying on his wife's prostitution to make a living; since there have been the two words "general," there has never been such bad luck. However, it can also be seen that this author Yu Yi Bao is very unintelligent. He has such a wonderful pen, if he is willing to write about anti-Japanese generals and civil war generals, wouldn't he get both fame and fortune? There is also a woman, Shen Ying, who actually opposes women being good wives and mothers; this is greatly contrary to the teachings of the saints, and is especially unworthy of instruction. Please note: Back in the fifth and fourth years, "the revolution has not yet succeeded," and the good wife and good mother doctrine was indeed criticized by enlightened people, but now, "the revolution" has long been successful, and the dynasty and the field sing the tune of construction together, and the virtuous mother and virtuous son contain the great construction, so the woman's novel "Yu Yu" is a mistake of the times. It can be seen that this author is not a clever person who is good at adapting to change. There are already too many words, let's put down the creation category, and look at other articles. There are nine papers in this issue, just looking at the titles, I feel that those authors are really unteachable. For example, sorting out the national heritage is necessary; but why not write an "On the Ming Dynasty's Destruction by the Rebel Bandits," but instead write something like "The Writing Era and Social Background of Jin Ping Mei?" There is even such confused talk as "In less than a few decades, the volcano will erupt!" Directly wanting to trace the great chaos at the end of the Ming Dynasty to the big officials of the Ximen Qing class! Jumping from the papers to the "Book and Newspaper Supplement," first is Bi Shutang's "Recent Literary Papers in British and American Magazines," which gave me a shock. This Mr. Bi is also an incurable melon. People will not be like him, seriously reading British and American magazines one by one to do such an article. Even if people use such materials, they may not be willing to honestly write a topic: Recent Literary Papers in British and American Magazines. People will definitely write "Recent British and American Literary Trends," or more fashionable, "Recent Trends in the British and American Literary World," and so on.</p>
<p>In short, after reading this inaugural issue of "Literary Quarterly," my overall impression is: silly and lovable. People are working hard to do new-style examination essays, working hard to spread rumors and sell friends, working hard to take the chicken feather as an arrow to show off, extorting, nothing is impossible, and a group of people in the Literary Quarterly really want to work hard on the construction of new literature! They think they have no conflict with others. They don't know that on the day when the world is full of fools, it is certainly not allowed for smart people to be naughty, and on the day when the world is full of smart people, it is not allowed for fools to make trouble! However, this is an digression, anyway, let's get back to the topic, if someone wants to see something that is thankless, they may as well buy one; I will do a voluntary advertisement: Literary Quarterly: About 600 pages, priced at 50 cents, published by Lida Bookstore in Beiping, sold by various bookstores.</p>
<h3>Before Sunrise (4)</h3>
<p>— Gao Zhi</p>
<p>"Mom, if we could be like Third Aunt one day, that would be great." "As long as you're good and listen to Mom, listen to Third Aunt, there will be a good day." "Really?" Lian Di imagined herself wearing gold rings and gold earrings one day, how glorious that would be! "Of course." "Mom, what kind of fortune stick did you draw at the City God Temple?" "Medium good, isn't it?" "Good. Mom, what does the fortune stick say?" "It says your mom's hard days are almost over. It says as long as you're filial to Mom and listen to Mom, that's all you need to do." What was implied in Mom's words? Mom always said that daughters should be obedient and endure hardship. Lian Di thought that Mom's words were always the same, so she didn't need to ask further, and remained silent for a while. After a long time, her mother instructed her again: "When you go to the city to borrow rice tomorrow, don't be anxious. It doesn't matter if you stay for two days. Remember to wear that bamboo cloth jacket." "Wear it to the city? Do I have to wear new clothes to borrow rice? Let's save it for the New Year." "You're such a silly girl. If your clothes aren't a little better, people will think you're a beggar."</p>
<p>Lian Di didn't say anything. Aunt Qin thought, Lian Di is really a good daughter. She wanted to keep Lian Di's old clothes, so she said: "Third Aunt wants you to wear nice clothes so she can take you to wealthy families. Third Aunt will give you new clothes. These clothes you have on, you have to count them and give them to Third Aunt to keep, do you hear me?" "I understand. Mom, why don't other people wear new clothes when they go to the city?" "Who doesn't wear new clothes when they go to the city?"</p>
<p>"When Mom goes to the city to burn incense and see the City God, you don't wear new clothes." "Silly girl! Young women going to wealthy families can't be as casual as we are. Your mom is burning incense. It doesn't matter if I don't have new clothes to wear. Remember, when you put on your clothes, make sure they're neat and tidy, don't wrinkle them." Lian Di felt a little happy, hoping that dawn would come quickly. When she was about to go to bed, she casually said, "Mom, I walked past Lai Fu's grave today. Does he know that Sister misses him?" Aunt Qin became sad again. "How could he not know! Lai Fu had a hard life. If your father was ambitious, we wouldn't be suffering like this. It's really fate. If Lai An becomes a 'Chao Feng' in a big store one day, your mom will have a good life. The fortune stick said that your mom will be better next year, and you will be better too, not suffering with Mom all year round. Don't you want Lai An to be successful? If you are well off, don't forget him and Mom. Okay, go to sleep, you still have to go to the city tomorrow." Lian Di really listened to her mother and slowly fell asleep. Aunt Qin, however, was excitedly planning on the bed and couldn't sleep at all. Lian Di could no longer be kept at home to starve, she had to reluctantly let Lian Di go. This was a glimmer of hope in her suffering. She felt that it was very painful to exchange her daughter for money, and she was almost crying with sadness. But then she thought that this was sending her daughter away to exchange for a "way out," and she also hoped that Lai An, who was an apprentice in the bamboo weaving shop, would have a better life because of Lian Di, so she comforted herself and relieved a little of the pain.</p>
<p>She didn't sleep all night, planning repeatedly. She couldn't hear the rooster crowing and didn't know when dawn would break. She waited anxiously until there was a faint white light in the crack of the door. She was still restless and got up. Usually, she would definitely call her daughter to get up, but now she only tiptoed out of bed and put on her clothes. The Third Aunt in the neighboring room heard the sound and woke up, asking:</p>
<p>"Aunt Qin, are you up?" "It's getting light. Third Aunt, sleep a little longer." "I have to get up too, to go to the city early." "Don't sleep a little longer? I'll boil water first, you rest for a while, it doesn't matter." Before Lian Di left, Aunt Qin didn't forget to urge her to put on the bamboo cloth jacket. Seeing her daughter's happy expression, she felt sad again. "Mom, I'll be back tonight." "It doesn't matter, if there's no rice, wait for two days, Mom will come to pick you up."</p>
<p>"Mom, what about the sack? There's no basket or sack, how will I carry the rice?" Aunt Qin hesitated, not having thought about how to answer this question yet. Third Aunt quickly said:</p>

<h3>Fluctuating Gold Market Before Noon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market's situation was uncertain. The market fluctuated before noon, but the overall trend was still stable. Early in the morning, due to the contraction of the silver market overseas and the rise in the US market, the forward silver price on the metal exchange fell by 1.5 to 2.9 cents. Exchange rates rose and fell. Stocks rose by $1.09, US cotton fell by 4 points, US wheat rose by 3.15, and wool prices opened slightly lower. It was reported that Reuters Washington reported that the President had signed the currency bill at 3:54, reducing the fineness of the US dollar, which will be issued on Wednesday. In addition, the silver faction in the House of Representatives is gradually gathering strength, and congressmen from the Midwest and Pacific coast have stated that they strongly desire free coinage of silver currency regardless of any gold and silver ratio. The situation turned weak, but due to large-scale purchases, it rebounded in an instant and once broke through the $700 mark. However, the opening price in the morning was still within the mark. After opening, the price fell due to the easing of the domestic banking market. Then, banks took advantage of the low price to purchase, and HSBC's listing rebounded, stabilizing people's minds. Large buyers were still buying strongly, and the gold price rose. Later, the exchange rate was unstable and there were few transactions, and the gold price fluctuated. Later, due to the sale by speculator Mr. Lu, the price fell for a while, but soon rebounded again. The overall trend was still fluctuating, and the price of raw gold was $1,105. The market situation before noon is recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was $699, up $1.90 from the previous close. The price of goods opened at $8.80. The exchange rate opened with the near-term selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling 4.25 pence and US exchange at $33.875. May US dollars were difficult to sell at $34.4375.

Zhengjin bought May US dollars at 5625, and Qianchang, Xiangshunli, Dadecheng, Zhifengyong and others successively bought, and it rebounded to outside $7. The situation then began to fluctuate. After entering, Zhaofeng, Changfuchang, Yuanchang, Yongyuan, Maoyonglai sold, Mitsui and Sumitomo came out with May US dollars at half a yuan, and it retreated to $6.

<p>Approaching the Old Accounting Period</p>
<h3>The Collection and Settlement of Silver Dollars is Becoming More Busy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver dollar interest rate did not rise or fall, and it was 2 cents in the morning and afternoon. The head exchange was ignored because there was too much money, and it was done as a white exchange. In the exchange of exchange tickets, the transfer in the morning market was only more than 2.4 million, and the new transaction was more than 300,000. The transaction in the afternoon market was more than 400,000. The transaction in the small general meeting was more than 500,000. As for the banks, this day was the end of the month, and the usual collection and settlement were extremely busy. Now it is also the end of the lunar year, and all the income and expenditure of the whole year must be summarized at the end. Therefore, the collection and settlement time is particularly extended, and the amount is too large to check the details in a short time, so it is omitted. The collection and settlement of the foreign public list of money houses was more than 47 million, and the foreign exchange head exchange was said to be more than 10 million. The details could not be visited. The exchange rate from all over the country was more than 700,000, and the cash collection was more than 1 million. The transaction of foreign exchange mortgage was more than 900,000, the collection of banknotes was more than 700,000, and the issuance was more than 800,000. The source of passenger transportation was 200,000, and the expenditure was 50,000.

<h3>Deposit Interest Rates Are Still Unusually High</h3>
<p>It is found that after the money industry closed for two days in January, it opened on the 3rd, and it was only 29 days until the end of the month. And the market price was very low every day, only a few cents were opened. As a result, the total statistics for the whole month were 1 yuan 4 jiao 2 fen, and the daily rate was 4 fen 9 li, which was still less than the fixed market price of 2 yuan. If so, the proposal of the daily meeting to close the deposit interest rate case is still between 2 yuan 9 jiao 5 kou.</p>
<h3>Among Subsidiary Coins, Only Guangdong Coins Are Slightly Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small coins did not move, and the morning and afternoon markets were the same at 855 yuan. The transaction was 9,000 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small coins fell by 2 yuan and 6 jiao, with the morning market at 788 yuan 3 jiao and the afternoon market at 787 yuan 8 jiao.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Many Floating Funds Exit, Bond Prices Fall</h3>
<p>The Customs Tariff for 1933 Alone Rose by $1.50</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange gradually became weak. This was also a return of the wind and many floating funds had exited or swap. Therefore, there were some rumors in the market, but they were not credible at all. The general trend was due to the swap relationship, but all items of the 20th were sold, the 32nd wildly sold gold short, and the 46th still had salt tax sold. The market price was at a high level, which easily caused the small shareholders to release floating profits. In the morning, the various gangs sold more. Generally, they all fell by 3-4 jiao, but the gold short fell the most by 7 jiao due to the excessive sale of the 32nd. In the second round, the shorts slightly swapped and generally recovered by 1-2 jiao. The 5th also bought a lot, and the gold short returned by 4 jiao, but people's hearts were still not strong. In the afternoon, the futures transaction was still enthusiastic, and the trend still did not improve. Generally, it turned back by a small amount of 2-3 jiao. The closing transaction was clear, and the trend was chaotic. The market price rose and fell each other. As a result of the day, except for 18 customs and 96 slightly better by 5 fen to 1 jiao and a half, and the customs tariff for 1933 rose by $1.50, which was not related to the overall rise and fall. The rest all fell by 2-3 jiao to 7-8 jiao, but the salt tax for this month fell by $1. The situation may have a period of fluctuation, but it is temporary and not long, because the number of transactions in this month is too large and the period is very short, which is not allowed to persist. The total number of transactions was 17,911,000 yuan, including only 1,000 yuan of unified tax in spot goods, and 6,445,000 yuan of unified salt tax in futures, 2,135,000 yuan of disarmament, 1,245,000 yuan of 19 customs welfare, 2,660,000 yuan of 20 volumes and 20 customs, 2,835,000 yuan of gold short and 6, and 1,835,000 yuan of 96. Recently, the transaction of gold short has gradually become popular, and the various gangs have made a lot of income and expenditure, and it will replace the position of salt tax in the future.</p>
<p>Dow Jones Industrial Average</p>
<h3>The Highest Peak Since 1931</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported on the 30th that the New York stock market continued to advance, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke through the resistance line of 1933, creating the highest peak since 1931. The smooth transaction was also unprecedented since July 22 last year. The purchase notice was all over the world, and the transmission machine was lagging behind all day. The broker's office was extremely crowded, and the lively situation was comparable to 1928 and 1929. Although the bulls had settled, the absorption was very easy. In the end, the market returned to a high level, and the giants reached new peaks one after another. The total number of transactions throughout the day was 4,240,000 shares. Looking at the stock market in the afternoon, railway stocks have the potential to follow the industrial stocks and lead the way. The "wheat" market rose slightly due to the strong stock market. The southwest is still dry, and domestic demand is also showing significant progress. It can be bought when it falls. The government sold "cotton," and the bulls took profits. In March, there were stockholders, but the market was not easy to fall. The climate in the cotton-producing area was cold, and the spot goods were firm and quiet. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>
<p>Closing price Compared to the previous day</p>
<p>30 industrial stocks 108.99 Up 1.09</p>
<p>20 railway stocks 50.55 Up 1.52</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>The Yarn and Cotton Market Has Not Gotten Rid of Its Flat and Weak State</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still flat and tired. Because the bottom goods of each factory are still thick, and the economy in all directions is difficult, the business is particularly sluggish. Therefore, people's hearts have no spirit. But in the share, the standard yarn price has a view of the situation, and I dare not predict it.</p>
<h3>There is a Lack of Bidding Buyers</h3>
<p>In the opening market before the bidding, the foreign cotton was average, and there were not many buyers in the market. February rose by 1 jiao, and March fell by 1 jiao. It was heard in the afternoon that although there were 1,000 or so packs of spot yarn from the Sichuan gang, the price was cheaper, so the market price was still weak. Each month also fell by 2, 3 jiao. The statistics of the whole day's transactions were 6,050 packs. It was found that Dachang sold 400 packs, Dafeng 850 packs, Hede 250 packs, Ruidda 500 packs, and Changyu 200 packs. Daji bought 1,250 packs, Hengyi 200 packs, Delong 400 packs, Tonghe 300 packs, and Renfeng 200 packs. The closing price is as follows.</p>
<p>Bidding Closing Price Rise/Fall Inventory Account Number April 1760 Fall 3 40,700</p>
<p>February 1721 Fall 125,750 Total 100,250</p>
<p>March 1743 135,900</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still good, more than yesterday. It was found that the statistics of each gang buying the whole day were 1,793 packs. Among them, the goods purchased by the Sichuan gang had 500 packs of futures. The market was flat and down. Each gang bought such as Puyi Factory opened 1,000 pieces of 20-count single earth yarn, and the price was 183 yuan back tax, and the price was cheaper than retail transactions.</p>

<p>Inland 260 Ningbo 15 Yunnan 20 Hankou 2 Nanjing 5</p>
<p>The same industry 10</p>
<p>The cotton market is slightly tired. The rumor that there was a squeeze of the February futures cotton before the day made the situation soften, because some large households sold exclusively in this month, so the market was looser, but the market in the distant month was still strong. The current cotton consumption is not smooth, and the factories have stagnant demand due to the sluggish yarn market, but the source is withered, the rivers and roads in the mainland are frozen, the transportation is difficult, and the bulls are quite strong.</p>
<h3>A Giant Household Exclusively Sells February Cotton</h3>
<p>In the opening market before the Zheng bidding, the market was still tight, and it became loose after the second and third rounds of bidding. Each month fell by 5 fen. It was weak again in the afternoon. Each month fell by 1, 2, 3 jiao. The statistics of the whole day's transactions were 55,500 dan. It was found that Tongji sold 1,700 dan, Yuanda 1,300 dan, Changfeng 5,100 dan, Changhe 5,000 dan, Dafu 2,500 dan, and Chunji 4,200 dan. Hengyi bought 3,600 dan, Dafeng 2,800 dan, Gengfeng 3,800 dan, Tonghe 3,800 dan, Yudda 1,400 dan, Yifeng 2,900 dan, and Xiesheng 1,100 dan. The closing price is as follows.</p>

<p>March 4205 20 187,100 Total 654,600</p>
<p>April 4220 10 182,100</p>
<h3>Factory Demand is Still as Dull as Ever</h3>
<p>The current cotton business is very clear, and the needs of all parties are quite stagnant. The source counts 665 packs of Yao cotton and 788 packs of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 40.00 Yong'an Factory imported 202 pieces Delivered to the factory</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Velvet Cotton 41.50 Dacheng Factory imported 200 pieces Delivered to the warehouse</p>
<p>Zhangde Cotton 45.00 Shanghai Factory imported 364 pieces Delivered to the factory</p>
<h3>New Developments in the Cotton Yarn Industry</h3>
<p>New Standards Discussed but Not Implemented</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn Trying to Dump</p>
<p>The rumor of cotton yarn changing to new standards has been around for a long time, but now it has subsided. Outsiders cannot know what is going on, and there is no need to predict it. It is said that the reason for this change of standards is nothing more than the different opinions of people in the industry, the different perspectives on buying and selling transactions, and the fact that large-scale producers have the ability to influence the market. If the East says so, they follow the East; if the West says so, they follow the West. Therefore, there is no lack of suppressing the weak, resulting in deep-seated resentment. Once it erupts, everyone works together, and even ants can carry a praying mantis away. Today's situation is similar to this.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the cotton yarn exchange, there have been two standards. One is Yunhe from Hengfeng Yarn Factory, which is used as the standard for the Goods Exchange. When the Yarn and Cloth Exchange was established, the momentum of the Goods Exchange was stronger. The Yarn and Cloth Exchange wanted a cotton yarn equivalent to Yunhe, which could compete with it and be mutually convertible. Therefore, Ren Zhong, produced by Shenxin Yarn Factory, was selected. Later, cotton yarn trading gradually concentrated on Yarn and Cloth. When the new building of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange was completed (the current site), its momentum suddenly increased. At that time, the Goods Exchange happened to have a dispute over stock delivery, and all yarn and flower trading was divided by the Yarn and Cloth and Cotton Industries Exchanges, creating today's situation. Since Ren Zhong is produced by Shenxin, and Shenxin has as many as nine factories, although not all of their yarn is Ren Zhong, their production volume is certainly not comparable to that of ordinary factories. A brief description of the production capacity of Shenxin's factories is as follows. The numbers may contain errors, please forgive the readers.</p>
<p>Factory Name Address Spindle Count Yarn Spindle Count Total Annual Yarn and Thread Production</p>
<p>Shenxin 1 Shanghai 72,476 None 26,146</p>
<p>Shenxin 2 Shanghai 55,000 7,140 24,519</p>
<p>Shenxin 3 Wuxi 65,000 None 39,200</p>
<p>Shenxin 4 Hankou 30,000 None 16,800</p>
<p>Shenxin 5 Shanghai 47,488 16,032 23,590</p>
<p>Shenxin 6 Shanghai 76,040 2,572 33,590</p>
<p>Shenxin 7 Shanghai 59,848 13,608 26,893</p>
<p>Shenxin 8 Shanghai 50,400 None 37,977</p>
<p>Shenxin 9 Shanghai 80,556 10,860 52,300</p>
<p>Total 536,808 50,212 291,277</p>
<p>In addition, Hengfeng Factory's Yunhe and Fugui brands, which are equivalent to Ren Zhong, also have 55,153 spindles, producing 46,186 bales of yarn annually. Therefore, the number of products equivalent to the standard is not small. Every time they are sold, the actual product is provided, and the warehouse is full of standard yarn, which inevitably affects the market, and the proposal for standard reform arises. The Golden Rooster yarn, which is currently under discussion but not implemented, originally had an extra yuan added to its grade on the standard. It is produced by Tongyi Factory. Tongyi has 65,852 yarn spindles and 13,208 thread spindles, and can produce 36,587 bales of yarn and thread annually.</p>
<p>Others equivalent to it include Puyi No. 1 Factory's Single Globe, Dafeng's Balloon, and Zhengzhou Yufeng's Green Airship. Puyi has 25,600 spindles and can produce 16,884 bales of yarn annually. Dafeng has 29,952 spindles and produces 18,600 bales of yarn. Yufeng has 56,448 spindles and produces 41,314 bales of yarn. Since the proposal to change to Golden Rooster was put forward, initially supporters accounted for five-sevenths of the number, but later there was no lack of hesitation, so it was shelved. According to market rumors, the difference between the new and old grades is too great. Originally, it was only one yuan higher, but now the ordinary grade is almost seven yuan lower. Those that were originally equal to Ren Zhong are now also four yuan lower. Therefore, one party, for the sake of face, had to make some expressions, which caused the reform to be suspended. The above is all hearsay. Whether this is the case will be verified in the future. However, the Japanese are using their strength and all kinds of methods to try to sell their cotton yarn. It is said that the Japanese yarn sold on the market is compared with the same grade of Chinese yarn, and the cheapest of them is chosen, but it is still no match for the low price of Japanese yarn, which is still eight or nine yuan higher. Recently, it was heard that a yarn merchant from a certain province in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River specially sent a representative to Shanghai to purchase Japanese yarn, which was said to be shipped to Chongqing and other places by Japanese ships. After tax refunds, each bale of yarn only costs more than 170 yuan. May I ask if Chinese yarn has this price? Chinese merchants and yarn factories are like birds nesting on a dangerous curtain, and they still use oppression as their ability and infighting as their business. Regardless of who wins, they will eventually hasten their own demise and create opportunities for Japanese yarn factories.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Market Fluctuations Not Significant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market rose initially due to mass buying, and then fell back due to long positions closing. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, and futures prices fell two to five points. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose 13 points, and futures prices rose 34 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 12 points. The Bombay cotton market rose initially due to speculator buying, and then fell back due to European exporters selling. As a result, Pingar rose 2.5 rupees, Oomra rose 2.25 rupees, and Broach rose 3 rupees. Original telegram on the left (telegram from the 30th).</p>

<h3>Quantity of Futures Flour Delivered</h3>
<p>Reached 319,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery of January futures flour. The total quantity delivered throughout the day was a record worthy of consideration in the past year, totaling 319,000 bags, including 203,000 bags of Red and Blue Car, 89,000 bags of Green Cannon, 20,000 bags of Green Phoenix, 1,000 bags of Green Wheat Root, 1,000 bags of Green Eagle Ball, and 5,000 bags of Green Three Stars. It is said that most of this batch of warehouse receipts are new goods, and only a few thousand bags are returned goods. As for the receivers, it is said that they are large hoarders close to the banking industry in this port, and no out-of-town merchants received any. The market in January, at the beginning of the month, fell to a low of 2.08 yuan due to sluggish actual sales and large factory stocks. Later, due to the slight extraction by out-of-town merchants and the absorption by large holders, it gradually rose, eventually being squeezed up to 2.225 yuan, with a difference of 0.145 yuan.</p>
<h3>Few Deliveries and Receipts of Futures Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the end of the month. There was no market for futures wheat. The current wheat from Xianxin went to Suzhou by one car, priced at 4.10 yuan, similar to the previous market. There were few deliveries and receipts this month. Yesterday's receipts and deliveries only included one car delivered from No. 6 and received by No. 8.</p>
<h3>Little High-Quality Rice, Only Yangjian Rice Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, nearly 40 firms, with more than 6,000 piculs of rice from various regions, arrived. The market situation is still stable due to the unresolved labor dispute in the North Shanghai market. Therefore, the situation has been somewhat shaky since the beginning of the market. However, the overall situation is brewing, and it is difficult to revitalize the exhausted spirit. Therefore, Changbang, Subang, and other japonica rice are only selling at 5 cents. Dujian rice has no price changes. Only Yangjian rice has risen slightly due to the scarcity of goods. Various firms are tightening their purchase plates for late rice. Although the purchases continue to go out by 2,000 bags, the market situation has been fixed. Although the route for inferior rice is weak, the arrival of goods is also rare, so the market color can be tight again.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) The incident caused by rickshaw pullers and shoulder porters the day before yesterday has been reported in this newspaper. Leaders of the rice industry in North Shanghai petitioned the authorities, and the authorities agreed to mediate the labor dispute and dispatch police protection. All businesses followed the order to maintain the people's food supply. Yesterday morning, more than 20 boats arrived at the river, but each firm's transactions were not many. It was not until noon that they started trading. However, the commission rates opened were all fixed for several days, so yesterday's market was equivalent to no market, so there was no market situation to report.</p>
<h3>Quanzhou Merchants Continue to Handle Customer Xian Rice</h3>
<p>Fuzhou is also actively shipping... Market price rises another 10 cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the customer Xian rice market had many arrivals, but the sales were even stronger. The Fujian merchants had a very strong appetite. This street and Ningbo also had intentions to handle it. The Quanzhou merchants, after handling it once a few days ago, stopped immediately after handling it, fearing accidents because the situation in that area was not completely stable. Now that the war in that area can be avoided and the surrounding areas are safe, yesterday, 2,476 bags of Hunan machine-red rice, machine-Jing rice, and machine-oil rice were purchased in the market. Quanzhou's sales activity made the market even more firm. The Fuzhou merchants were very interested in handling it and competed with the Quanzhou merchants and others in the market to handle it. Therefore, each rice continued to rise by 6-7 cents to 10 cents. The total transaction of various rice in the market reached 8,000 bags. Except for Quanzhou, this street and Ningbo took 130 bags of machine-Jian rice and 863 bags of Wuxian rice. The remaining Hunan, Jiangxi, Jiangbei, Nanjing, and Wuxi rice were all handled by Fuzhou. The market is still bullish because the local merchants are active in the later market.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3>Peanut Oil Trend is Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the peanut oil market atmosphere was good. The supply was not flooding, and the sales were not weak. The brokers were very interested in trading, so their buying appetite was quite strong. The total market transaction was 100 pieces of Ber Sheng oil, priced at 10.06 yuan, 2,000 pieces of Jiachang Sheng oil, priced at 10.03 yuan, and 600 pieces of Light Skin Sheng oil, priced at 9.06 yuan. However, soybean oil was slightly inferior to Sheng oil because the telegrams were rising and falling inconsistently, causing people to be unstable.</p>
<h3>Hankou Tallow Oil Telegram Reported a Drop</h3>
<p>Tallow oil, half a month ago, because the supply from Hankou was scarce and various places were purchasing for reserves, the sales occasionally saw prosperity, and the market rose slightly as a result. However, those who handled it stopped as soon as a batch was handled, and the market stabilized as a result. By last week, the supply arrived continuously, but the sales were weak, and the market situation showed fatigue again. Moreover, the closing period was approaching, and the sales market was naturally scarce. However, sellers had no choice but to sell, so non-cheap prices could not attract buying interest. Therefore, the telegram from Hankou reported a drop for two consecutive days. The heavy Jing was opened at 16.23 yuan, and the Ping Jing was at 15.78 yuan. Only the Macheng oil was still between 15.78 yuan, as if it had not fallen enough. Brokers in this port were indifferent to the import of goods, and sales were also scattered. However, recently, more than 1,000 pieces of customer cargo heavy Jing arrived, all of which were distributed by various firms. The price was said to be only about 20 yuan per piece on delivery, said to have been transported from Yichang.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods, Wood Ear Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the cold weather, the source of wood ear was hindered, and the land price also rose sharply at this time. According to the local telegram, high-grade wood ear actually costs 90 yuan. Judging from the current Shanghai market, although the price has risen by more than 10 yuan, it is still difficult to make a profit. Yesterday's market price for ordinary high-grade wood ear was 80 yuan to 78 yuan, and it looked tighter afterwards.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, and Foreign Exchange Depreciation Affect Silk Sales</h3>
<p>(China Silk Transported to the United States Has Become Scarce) The United States has always been the largest consumer of China silk. In the most prosperous period, 4,000 to 5,000 bales were shipped to the United States every month. In recent years, due to the encroachment of Japanese silk and rayon, the sales of China silk to the United States have declined sharply. The quantity of China silk shipped from Shanghai to the United States last month (i.e., January) has become scarce. Only 295 bales were shipped in the entire month, all of which were white factory silk. The other yellow, white, and gray silk were not shipped to the United States.</p>
<p>(Duplex Silk Supply Cannot Meet Demand) Recently, the spring sales of duplex silk have started, and the demand from India is increasing. However, only Fulun silk factory in Shanghai is working, and the silk production is not abundant, so the supply cannot meet the demand. Last month (i.e., January), a total of 228 bales of duplex silk were shipped to India.</p>
<p>(Foreign Firms are Waiting for the Right Time) The overseas raw silk market, because the sales season has arrived, the current silk market price is becoming increasingly firm. Although New York and Lyon sent telegrams yesterday morning to inquire about the market price of yellow and white factory silk, the foreign exchange continued to depreciate, so the Chinese silk merchants are still waiting for the right time because the prices do not match. Yesterday, only Xinfu imported 20 bales of white factory silk and Zhonghe imported 20 bales of gray silk, and the price rose by 5-6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Some Sales of Small-Leaf Pearl Tea</h3>
<p>The foreign firm tea market in this port has been unusually sluggish recently. Although the Xiehe Yihang and other firms sent telegrams the other day because the Chinese merchants were willing to lower prices for Zhenmei green tea, there was no response. No one has asked about Zhenmei, Xiumei, and other items for days. However, Jinlong Tianxiang and other firms bought more than 50 boxes of low-grade small-leaf pearl tea yesterday, and the price was 48 yuan, which was 4-5 yuan lower than before. In addition, the sales of green tea, jasmine tea, and broken leaves in shops are also quite active. Market Price</p>

<h3>A Wealthy Man Despises Money</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>In ancient China, there was a scholar who so detested money that he refused to call it money, instead referring to it as "Aduwu" (a derogatory term for money). He hated this thing to the point of disliking even its name. However, this scholar was not wealthy. His aversion to money likely stemmed from a lack of it, and from being oppressed by it. In today's money-driven society, this is not surprising. A news report from Athens, Greece, tells of a very wealthy industrialist named Ramas who displayed a peculiar eccentricity. From the top of his residence, he scattered banknotes of 100, 500, and 1000 drachmas (the Greek currency). Passersby scrambled to grab them. In a world plagued by economic panic, where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, the poor may outwardly despise money, but their eyes light up at the sight of it. It is no wonder that thousands of Athens' poor, hearing of the wealthy man scattering banknotes, gathered spontaneously to compete for the airborne currency, to the point where "the scramble devolved into a riot."</p>
<p>A wealthy man becomes wealthy by desperately seizing money. But now, this foreign wealthy man says he deeply loathes this filthy lucre and feels burdened and wearied by it. This reveals that money is capable of inspiring loathing in both the poor and the rich. Consider that in ancient times, trade was conducted solely through barter. Later, someone invented the ingenious method of using currency as a medium of exchange. Since then, although humans were meant to use this treasure, the treasure has instead used humans. The inventor of this system is truly detestable. Our historical records and mythological legends credit Suirenshi with the discovery of fire, Shennongshi with the discovery of medicine, and the Yellow Emperor with the invention of the navigational compass. However, no explicit record exists of the inventor of currency. Perhaps "the originator of a practice without funeral statuettes will have no descendants." His name has vanished, and his fame remains unproclaimed. The reason for the currency inventor's nameless obscurity is that the ancients also deeply detested money, unwilling to propagate his great name to future generations in the same way they celebrated the virtues of Suirenshi and Shennongshi.</p>
<p>During the Spring and Autumn period, Confucius said, "If wealth could be obtained by seeking it, I would become a mere whip-holder." This shows that wealthy people already existed at that time, and they were already powerful figures. Therefore, although Confucius did not desire wealth, he still taught Zigong the ways of commerce. However, even a sage like Confucius only refrained from seeking wealth and did not deeply loathe money. This shows that even sages are powerless against the magic of money. Now, this foreign wealthy man in Greece has come to despise money. Is he more accomplished than our Chinese sages?</p>
<p>The news report states that police, deeming him "mentally deranged, sent him to a certain hospital." In a capitalist society, to uphold the dignity of the capitalist system, labeling him "mentally deranged" is naturally the best approach. However, it is regrettable that we can no longer hear the opinions of this wealthy man who rejects money.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, we have not heard of wealthy people despising money. In fact, once someone becomes wealthy, they face the risk of being kidnapped and extorted by bandits, restricted in their freedom, and constantly filled with anxiety. Clearly, they are burdened by money. How can they willingly endure this? Perhaps this is why the monetary system is so remarkably great. However, in the eyes of the poor, this monetary system is the source and control center of all social evils. Everyone curses it, everyone deeply loathes it. This is why society is not peaceful. If all the wealthy people in the world despised money, the world would certainly be at peace. I believe this to be true.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Movement</h3>
<p>— Guang Han</p>
<p>Recently, various groups in this city, due to the post-Songhu Battle situation, have seen increasing economic depression. However, instead of rents being reduced, some have even increased. Therefore, they are demanding lower rents to ease the burden and revitalize the prosperity of the city. A committee has been formed to carry out a rent reduction movement, which is something worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Among life's necessities, besides clothing and food, housing is undoubtedly essential. Shanghai is a major trading port in our country, with a population of over three million. The housing issue has become a serious problem in society. The high cost of Shanghai's rent has always been the highest in the country, and property owners only think of their own benefit, ignoring the livelihood of the people. They often raise rents, causing countless residents to lose most of their annual income to landlords. The impact on individuals' livelihoods is obvious, and the market will decline, leading to social unrest. The only solution is rent reduction. Therefore, the rent reduction movement is a legitimate action to solve residents' housing problems. Solving housing problems can not only allow individuals to live in peace and prosperity but also promote the prosperity of the market and maintain social tranquility. However, while expressing our full support for the movement, we cannot help but notice a major flaw. It seems that the committee's efforts are only focused on representing businesses and secondary landlords in demanding rent reduction from primary landlords, while ignoring the sub-tenants. This can be seen from the committee's resolutions. Here, we must ask: Among the residents who rent houses, besides businesses and secondary landlords, aren't there also sub-tenants? Although there are no statistics on the number of sub-tenants in the city, it can be said that they are numerous. Moreover, secondary landlords often pass on the pressure from primary landlords to sub-tenants. The suffering of sub-tenants is no less than that of secondary landlords. Now that secondary landlords are unwilling to endure the exploitation of primary landlords and are demanding rent reduction, it is dictated by the situation. Don't sub-tenants also have sufficient reason to resist the exploitation of secondary landlords? Therefore, I believe that if the committee only represents the interests of secondary landlords, then this movement is not thorough and will not have much impact on the entire population. Perhaps some may say that if the primary landlord reduces the rent, not only will the secondary landlord directly benefit, but the sub-tenant will also indirectly benefit. Once the goal of the secondary landlord is achieved, the rent for the sub-tenant can naturally be reduced. I think this is not necessarily the case. It must be understood that human nature is selfish. Although secondary landlords feel the pain themselves and appeal to primary landlords, they may not necessarily sympathize with the situation of sub-tenants or be willing to concede. Therefore, I believe that if people in society truly want to alleviate the people's difficulties, revitalize the market, and maintain society, this rent reduction movement must be thorough and universal. Not only should demands for rent reduction be made to primary landlords, but also the same advice should be given to secondary landlords. Only in this way will it benefit the majority of Shanghai residents, and only then can it help the prosperity of the market and the tranquility of society!</p>
<h3>Confession of an Ideal Life</h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>Whenever people mention living life, it seems as if one must sharpen their heads and squeeze into this turbid society. However, I hate this argument the most. I always feel that this is a display of servility, a most profound exposure of the base behavior of people. Why must living life involve being obsequious? Why must living life involve relying on the whims of those corrupt individuals and living a precarious existence? I do not understand this deviation from human nature. I do not understand why they must squeeze into this so-called professional society, pushing each other out, engaging in cutthroat competition, knocking others down while they rush forward to take their place? Why must they be so base? If human life must be colored by such base behavior, then why don't they just die?</p>
<p>As for me, I am rebelling against them. I cannot have such intentions. If I were to have such intentions, then I would no longer be myself. I would already be one of them.</p>
<p>As for me, although I feel the same way that I have to live since I was born, I do not have the same opinions on how to live as they do; if I were to live a life of servility, relying on the whims of others, then I would rather die sooner. Because so-called life must have a noble meaning, a vibrant sense of life, which can never be expressed in such servility.</p>
<p>How shall I choose my way of life? I am determined to do it this way: I will decide to live the life of a recluse like the sages of the past. I would rather be indifferent and live in seclusion among the mountains and valleys, unknown to the world. I will not visit any great men, nor will I be close to any powerful figures. Let nature always be pure and sacred to me, let the bright moon be my companion, and let the clear spring reflect my heart! Let the sanctions of society and the shackles of society forever leave me.</p>
<p>From this quiet life, let me immerse myself in the poetic spirit of those ancient poets, and let my heart, untainted by worldliness, forever be with those great and sacred hearts. As for the world, I am willing to abandon it to those worldly people, let them meet each other with bombs and pistols in their meetings! Let them betray friends and relatives betray relatives!……</p>
<p>Perhaps some may scold me for speaking nonsense, but that is where they are wrong! In this turbid and inaccessible society, being able to pull oneself out of all disputes, not only not watching arrogantly from the sidelines but also suddenly going into seclusion, this cannot but be said to be another kind of natural state of mind! Is it that even this, not disturbing others at all, not interfering in other people's lives at all, is not allowed by the world? If even this is not allowed, then this is truly a tyrannical world! "What else can be said!"</p>
<h3>The Inevitability of the Commodification of Love</h3>
<p>— Lie Huo</p>
<p>People in general (perhaps including myself) often bitterly denounce the fact that modern women's love has been trampled on by money and has simply become a commodity. While this is true, it is actually inevitable. What in this world is not trampled on by money? What is there that has not become a commodity? In Sinclair's "The Jungle," there was such a description of the situation in the slaughterhouse. He said that because the organization of the machines was so strict, no matter whether it was beef, cowhide, cow bones, or cow hair, not even half a bit would be wasted. Even cow blood and cow dung each had its own use; the only thing that could not be made into a commodity was the miserable cry of the cow being slaughtered. This is of course a sharp description, and also a true description, because the spirit of modern society is just like that.</p>
<p>If we know that in modern society not only has physical labor become a commodity, but even intellectual labor has also become a commodity, then we will not be surprised that modern society has made love into a commodity. Workers need to live, so they sell their labor. Intellectuals such as scholars, professors, philosophers, writers, artists, scientists, etc., in order to live, sell their knowledge, writings, works of art, and new inventions. And when a woman wants to make herself survive, and when she has nothing better than her body and her love to sell, she can only sell her only body and love to the buyer. The reason for this is the problem of survival. If a person can appreciate the fervent desire to survive, then he will not be surprised by this kind of selling of one's most precious things for survival. It is originally difficult for a modern woman to make a living. If we pay attention to their talents, their physical constitutions, and their positions, we will be able to understand this point. Even if they stand on an equal footing with men, it is difficult to defeat men, let alone when they are in a position different from men? We know that all people want to survive, and women are of course no exception. But what do they rely on to survive? This is the biggest reason why they sell their love. They are moving and flirtatious, and these two major elements of being moving and flirtatious constitute the main components of their becoming commodities. In addition, they are particularly fond of vanity, and the expression of vanity is all kinds of things that can only be bought with a lot of money. Therefore, their natural buyers are of course those who are rich and can often buy these noble things to satisfy their vanity.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, only moving appearance, youthful handsomeness, and a kind of warm and enthusiastic mood are the elements that arouse love in women. Originally this is correct. However, these things are not ultimately money. In their minds, even if it is a very handsome and lovable young man, it would be a very painful thing if he could only settle his lover in a low and foul-smelling shack. Therefore, in our view, vanity seems to be unimportant, but women cannot think this way. In feudal society, the height of a person was expressed by their rank. At that time, there were nobles who were so poor that they did not have a penny to their name who were respected. There were facts of nobles wearing torn noble clothes at high-class banquets. This kind of being respected even when they were so poor that they did not have a penny and were wearing torn clothes was a unique characteristic of the feudal system. Looking back, when we see the current capitalist society, the fact that people are respected if they have money is of course the same inevitable phenomenon. What can a person resist about their environment? If her environment wants her to do this. So I feel that we don't need to curse them either, because they are originally so weak and pitiful.</p>
<p>However, it is not that I have not taken into account the problem of these young people who take love as bread, but I feel that this problem cannot be mixed up with cursing them. Of course, love becoming a commodity is a bad thing, and I also feel that this bad thing is even worse for our ordinary young people. However, I always feel that this is not a problem of social sanctions, nor a problem of education, nor even a problem of curses. This problem is directly related to the existence of current society! Thinking of solving this problem from the point of social sanctions will definitely not be effective. Because in this current society, who can impose their sanctions? In other words, wanting to eliminate it from the point of view of education will not have any success either. Because in this current society, education has fundamentally lost its dominance. If it comes to cursing, that fundamentally cannot solve anything, but only disturbs oneself in vain for a while.</p>
<p>If we want to make love not become a commodity, then... forgive me for stopping speaking and putting down my pen here. || The End ||</p>
<h3>The Outrageous Act of an Athenian Millionaire</h3>
<p>— Mu Lang</p>
<p>According to a news report from Athens the other day:</p>
<p>A millionaire and major industrialist here named Mr. Lai Ma had a peculiar fit of eccentricity today. From the top of his residence, he scattered banknotes of one hundred, five hundred, and one thousand drachmas (the name of the Greek currency) downwards, causing passersby to scramble to grab them. This news instantly spread throughout the city, and tens of thousands of people gathered spontaneously, scrambling to grab the banknotes flying in the air. By the time the police arrived to suppress the situation, the scrambling had turned into a riot. They had no choice but to mobilize reserve soldiers to disperse the crowd. Later, the police entered Mr. Lai Ma's residence again and forbade him from throwing banknotes down again. However, when Mr. Lai saw the police enter his room, he immediately tore up the banknotes piled up like a mountain in front of him; and told the police: he deeply hated this kind of filthy money and said that he was deeply burdened by this "Adu thing" and felt quite pressured and tired. The police, thinking that he was mentally deranged, sent him to a certain hospital. His family checked his accounts and found that he had scattered more than one hundred thousand drachmas in an instant.</p>
<p>This shocking news, along with its power of dissemination, shook the hearts of every money-obsessed person in the world. We can imagine how enthusiastic and chaotic the state of the crowd under the house scrambling madly when the millionaire Mr. Lai Ma was scattering his banknotes? I cannot be sure exactly to what extent that enthusiastic state had reached, but I think the hopeful expressions of the general men, women, old and young who were craning their necks in the street a few years ago when a certain tobacco company scattered leaflets from an airplane in Shanghai that could be exchanged for cigarettes may be able to imagine one ten-thousandth of the madness of the crowd under the Athenian millionaire's house now.</p>
<p>However, apart from the description of the crowd, what deserves our attention is the hysterical behavior of that millionaire. Not being a psychologist, I cannot determine whether that millionaire belongs to a type of abnormality, but at least his nervous system suddenly lacked order, which is beyond doubt. One often hears people say that if one does too much of other things, one feels disgusted, such as feeling nauseous from eating too much food, or getting sleep sickness from sleeping too much. Only money is such a thing that no one ever complains about having too much of it, no matter what. But now it is not so. Now there are also people who hate money, no, not only hate it, but even tear up the banknotes that represent money. Isn't this contrary to the normal state of evolution? Granted, on the surface, Mr. Lai Ma's distributing banknotes to the crowd is a rare act of kindness or grandeur, but if we examine the reality, is he really bestowing blessings on all living beings? This can be known by just looking at his conversation with the police: he deeply hated this kind of filthy money... so it can be known that it is definitely not. He also said, "Deeply burdened by this 'Adu thing,' I feel quite pressured and tired." Therefore, his "deep hatred" of money is precisely a reaction to his past excessive "greed for money as if it were his life." From the Buddhist theory, this is the cycle of cause and effect. There is a famous saying in our ancient Chinese books, "Greed makes one lose one's mind," which can also be a portrayal of Mr. Lai Ma.</p>
<p>In China, I have never heard of such news, so a "fool" like Mr. Lai Ma is definitely hard to find in China. However, from daily life, we can often experience the same painful feelings as Mr. Lai Ma, but our opportunities are relatively small or indifferent, so our feelings are not so profound.</p>
<p>For example, someone bought an airline lottery ticket one day, and from that day until the lottery day, he almost lost sleep every night. When he knew that the number he bought was not the winning one after the lottery, he was relieved instead. In these dozens or days of anxious thought, he must have lost a few pounds of weight. If he won the grand prize, what a more severe and difficult test would this be for his mental and physical strength! Perhaps my words are a bit exaggerated, but I still feel that it is said of the general object.</p>
<p>However, those who suffer never complain about the bestower of the suffering they have suffered. Perhaps they do not even know who is causing their suffering, and of course, there is no way to complain. A millionaire may not be impossible to be, and wealth may not be impossible to accumulate, but if one becomes a millionaire and has money, but is instead subject to spiritual restraint or torment, then is wealth a happiness for people, or is it just suffering many pains in vain, and not even making a fortune, but suffering many pains in vain, like those who buy lottery tickets!</p>
<p>Here, the Athenian millionaire found an object to vent his pain - tearing up the banknotes - which is a clever and worthy prescription to imitate, because at least he can be free from worries from now on.</p>
<h3>A Secret to Getting Along in the World</h3>
<p>— Xue Fei</p>
<p>In the past, those who paid attention to getting along in the world generally did nothing more than the following two things: one was flattering, and the other was bragging. This is a well-known fact. Recently, I have developed a new secret to getting along in the world. This is to treat everyone as a bad person first. Don't easily express what's in your heart to anyone. Don't casually believe what others say. That is to say, always be three parts hypocritical to everyone.</p>
<p>Originally, hypocrisy can also be classified as part of bragging, but here it is necessary to specifically discuss and study it. Why? Because this is a secret to getting along in the world that ordinary people do not pay much attention to. And I especially suffered great practical harm because I did not understand this secret to getting along in the world, so I have a special understanding of this secret. I am qualified to talk about this issue.</p>
<p>The reason why I did not understand this secret and suffered practical harm is because I excessively believed the many honest words spoken by a friend, and as a result, I was betrayed by this friend. From this experience, I realized that one cannot be too honest when speaking. Being honest will make one "die unjustly," as Shanghai people say. Originally, this is something that people with some experience know. The reason why I was betrayed by a friend is not some unexpected encounter. It is a common thing in society, but I didn't even know it. Not only did I not know, but I am afraid that many young people in society are as confused as I am. This is a personal matter and not worth mentioning, so let's talk about things on a larger scale in society. Which thing in society is real? We know that advertisements in newspapers fundamentally have no reason to be believed. Their words must be at least × discounted. However, so-called news is also based on the principle of "recording everything heard." Only heaven and earth know what was actually heard.</p>
<p>So, is the entire society fundamentally unreal? That is not the case either. From another point of view, everything in society is real. How can this be explained? This must be seen horizontally from the combination of interests and vertically from the succession and evolution of interests before and after. We know that the combination of society is fundamentally a combination of interests; and the evolution of society is the succession and change of these interests. Recognizing this point, then we can grasp the center of the facts. If you can figure out the relationship of interests between them, then there is nothing that is not very simple. That is, everything comes naked with only interests. What morality... is nothing more than deceiving people. Thoroughly speaking, so-called morality and friendship are fundamentally built on the basis of interests. Without interests, there is no so-called morality and friendship. It was like this in ancient times, and it is even more so in modern times. If you want to abandon the relationship of interests and seek from other aspects, then you will be clueless about everything, and you will only feel that neither left nor right is right.</p>
<p>Since everything in the world is only true with regard to interests, then our secret to getting along in the world can be known. This is that you can only find your true friends in the relationship of interests. When he is good to you, he is definitely not truly loving you, but rather making use of you; when he no longer needs you, he may as well kick you away. If you think that he is sincerely treating you well, because you sincerely treat him, then you are making a big mistake, and as a result, you will definitely be fooled by him. This is an essential secret to getting along in the world.</p>

<h3>Fiction</h3>
<h3>The Lonely Person (3)</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>(II) On the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road</p>
<p>Immediately, Kejia helped Xiaoxun pack his luggage. The so-called luggage was very simple: a few changes of clothes, daily necessities, and books. After everything was packed, Kejia said: "I only came to Hangzhou the day before yesterday and saw you twice. The old nanny said you hadn't returned for two days. Staying at home, I'm afraid Grandma would say I'm still running around even when I'm getting married, so I stayed at the Lakeside Hotel. Since we're leaving tomorrow, I'll settle the room bill, and we'll sleep in the same bed tonight, how about that?"</p>
<p>"Okay! Isn't there any more lecturing to do?" Xiaoxun said with a laugh. He returned to his writing chair, crossed his legs, and habitually took out two cigarettes from the tobacco jar, handing one to Kejia, saying, "Let's smoke cigarettes instead."</p>
<p>Yeniu twitched the corner of his mouth, swallowing the words he was about to say. The two lit their cigarettes, and he went out.</p>
<p>Xiaoxun smoothed his naturally loose and curly hair, and the white smoke he exhaled, accompanied by the spring breeze, scattered outside the window in various ways. Indeed, that night, they talked about everything. They talked about Xiaoxun's romance with Qinbo, whether "being lovelorn is painful," and whether Kejia and Jingyi's "game" was embellishing life, all the sorrows falling behind the joys. The sky had unknowingly begun the next day. Xiaoxun called the old nanny to get up, and after washing up, they rushed to catch the early train to Shanghai. Although Xiaoxun said he was recuperating, this was the first time he had gotten up so early since coming to the West Lake.</p>
<p>Looking into the distance, the sun emerged from the mountain hollow, and its golden light shone on the lake surface. The March spring breeze blew, and the surface of the water rippled with the reflection of the willow branches, like ten thousand golden snakes swimming up from the clear water. Xiaoxun raised his naturally loose and curly hair, gently exhaled, and muttered to himself in the rickshaw: "I recognize the beauty of West Lake today."</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller slapped his thighs and quickly reached the train station in the morning breeze. Xiaoxun nervously glanced at the entire Hangzhou station, as if he were parting from his newlywed wife. Although he detested the ordinariness of life, he couldn't help but fall in love with it after staying for three months. "Contradictory life!" Kejia saw through Xiaoxun's feelings and smiled like he was singing a hymn.</p>
<p>They boarded the train amidst the noisy crowd, and with a whistle, the train slowly started moving. The two did not speak. Two different trains of thought occupied each other's minds. Their bodies felt a harmonious rhythm with the comfortable cushions, and in this peaceful environment, they were lulled into a hazy slumber.</p>
<p>The fields and houses on both sides receded backward, and a long train roared forward. When it stopped at Jiaxing Station, they were awakened by a woman's shout. Xiaoxun raised his head and saw a woman on the opposite seat looking at him with a friendly smile, thinking that the woman was laughing at them for sleeping soundly, he pretended to look out at the platform, feeling embarrassed. Kejia raised his eyelids slightly, then lowered his head again. Seeing that he hadn't noticed her, the woman moved closer to the small table separating the two seats, and tilted her head to say: "Kejia, we've arrived in Shanghai."</p>
