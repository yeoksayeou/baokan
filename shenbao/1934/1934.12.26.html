<h3 id="c22">日俄係之觀察恒 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>近數日來。日俄關係又見緊張如二十二日哈爾電傳日俄因互爭東寗附近一小島雙方調兵遣將。情勢頗形嚴重。翌日日方電訊。則謂俄兵百數十人在東寗附近築壕。全數被虜。而同日俄方電訊。則稱有一日本軍官。潛入俄境。攝取地圖。爲俄人捕獲。此種緊張狀態。爲數月來所僅見。雙方苟果有戰意。則不難以此爲戰爭之藉口。然而日俄兩方。對於己方人員爲人捕獲一節。旣不否認。亦不表示若何態度。反若置身局外。毫不憤慨。似甚可異。然而自九一八後。日俄關係。劍拔弩張。屢瀕於危。張弛緩急。巳非一次。卒至風平浪靜。和平過去。依此而觀。則今次雙方之。衝突。方之巳往之成例。其微末自不足道。宜其雙方之不重視也。</p>
<p>日俄兩國所以屢滋事端。而終未至於以兵戎相見者。亦自有其原因在。其最大者。即因日本在東北對作戰之時。蘇俄己乘機增强其在遠東之防禦。小規模之動員。必無倖勝之可能。加以對俄作戰。决非徒恃勇猛精進。一往無前卽。可了事。同時又須顧及蘇俄空軍之攻勢。慮及自己後方之空防。故日本對於對俄作戰。至今猶不能不躊躇逡巡。出以極持重之態度也。反之蘇俄欲對日作戰。亦顧慮甚多。再就今日之情勢觀察。尤可斷其任何衝突。不致擴大。蓋一則時屆冬令。日人對俄作戰。比較的處於不得地位。二則蘇俄史丹林派與托洛斯茨基二派之爭。又見復活。内難方深。當不至有何對外之動作。三則雙方仍在依據軍事需要。布置其交通綫之時代。作戰之條件。不免尚未全然成熟。四則日本在我東北現有之兵力。自守固有餘。攻人恐不足。故日本眞欲對俄用兵。似乎必須作大規模之動員。事前必有動員之預兆。否則未足視爲對俄用兵之徵候也。故日俄之戰其可能性雖較日美之戰更强。然爆發之期。必尚有待。可無疑義矣。</p>
<p>吾人所慮於日俄對立形勢之惡化不在今日而在於一九三六年之際。最近本年十二月中旬。日本外交時。載有吉村忠三所著之「日蘇對立與提携」一文。其結論（一）蘇聯邊境防軍。無論陸空各軍。均須撤至貝加爾湖以西。（二）日人入蘇自由不受治保安隊之干涉。（三）日人進出外蒙。須絕對自由。該地不應由蘇封銷。（四）立卽解决中東路及北洋漁業問題。（五）合日「滿」「外蒙」「新疆」爲一攻守同盟之集團然後答與蘇聯商酌永久和平之策、夫外交時報。與日本軍部素具密切關聯。而其論調又每與軍部如出一轍。證以近三數年之往事。巳足知之。今觀吉村氏所提之要點其欲實現大陸政策之雄心。躍於紙上。對俄之不能免於决裂。勢巳顯然。同時我國人觀吉村氏之論調。又能不惕然警覺乎。</p>

<p>之久者作實際之考察、彼等皆坦白表示、德國之勞働服務確無軍事性質、然吾人之勞働服務果何云乎、要而言之、所謂勞働服務者、乃卽德意志青年之創造、因此輩青年深知一九一八至一九三二年爲馬克斯國際民主主義的猶太人所操持的政府之矛盾、因此對之不滿、爲起反抗、當時分成甚多黨派、各黨鞏固勢力、各立各之政治主張、當時各黨皆知從事勞働服務之需要、於是人人皆努力於工作、其故安在、要而言之、實各黨均欲避免失業發生、在此情形之下、無論何人亦莫不努力工作、尤以工人大學生業手藝之人及青年人爲最、然則各黨之所以如此努力者、固屬同爲避免不幸之失業問題、但亦爲謀鞏固其黨之勢力、故出其生命之能力、以建造其黨之生機、當時全國不論老幼、雖然工作上並不需要此等老幼之人、但彼等之思想亦爲勞働精神所貫、人人皆望達到最大之勞働代價、由是勞働之觀念風行全球、故一切勞働習慣勞働精神之基礎於兹奠焉、二三年有、國社黨與鋼盔黨巳專心致力於勞働服務運動、因吾人深知此種運動、有國民經濟及禮儀之價值、故其運動日見擴大、力量逾增、吾人以勞働服務、避免各種頑固之高壓力、自一九三二年以來、最近數年内、德國之勞働服務運動日見擴大、非常迅速、總計有二十五萬青年加入工廠作工、只可惜此輩青年無智無識、並且又受各黨之影響、甘爲各黨之工具、自然此輩青年無系統之計劃、陷入妄動、卽爲法國所禁止之行爲、亦甘冐犯、故致愈作愈壞、胡作故爲、左右無定、不知何所適從、結果一無所成、嗣因國家社會主義革命突起、斯時卽創造勞働服務幸福之將來之時期也、自此次革命起後、去年三月間在現任共和總理希特勒領導之下、努力改良勞働服務運動、用合理之新方式、從新振刷、希特勒卽與勞工部長薛爾德曁各代表籌劃善策、任命黑埃爾爲勞働服務運動處秘書長領導此種運動、黑埃爾奉命後、卽經組成「共和國勞働服務指導處」、按序施行、成績斐然、將從前無組織左右不定之思想、廓除清浄、事事均有秩序、系統劃然、集中各人之觀點共同推進、勞働服務現己無其他政治黨派矣、德國之勞働服務在國社黨總理領導之下、努力推進、鋼盔黨同志亦完全接受國社黨之計畫、共同努力、現在而論、全國巳有二五○·○○○青年男工分配於一千五百個工廠中工作、齊心合力、實行黑埃爾之指導計畫、完成國社黨之任務、將來各大學生亦應有一時期手執鋤鏟務服於此種事業、「以作將來任官之必要資格」、大家負起責任、由父及子、世代相傳、盡力德國服務、馢</p>

<p>申時社云、本市銀行界有建議財部、奬勵運銀進口之說、申時社記者昨向銀行界探悉、關於奬勵銀進口問題、因外商方面須請政储發還前運出時白銀稅及平衡稅、或運回之銀、將來再出口時、免徵出口稅及平衡稅、方願將銀酌量運回、此事與我政会威信有關、財部是否輕易允准、尚在愼重考慮中、惟近日本埠銀行界領袖及財政當局等、連日確在磋商妥善辦法中、至昨傳匯豐銀行巳將現欵二千萬元、由港運回之說、此說尚未能證實、蓋平衡稅及銀稅問題、尚未解决、大批現銀運回、或尚無如此容易、但據一般深信、匯豐銀行在相當時期、運回白銀、確屬可能、蓋於二月前、由滬運港之現銀、不下七千萬元、前以廣汕等地兌現風潮甚熾、匯豐在華南所發紙幣較多、故爲充實凖備、不得不在港行儲集鉅量現金、以固信用、現該項風潮已過、將港方現銀酌運一部回滬、事實上確有可能性云、</p>

<p>趙國富那裏知道這事的究竟，繼續着道：我們這位培爾先生，私人還經理着德國啤酒。賈多才也不好說什麽，只得哦了一聲。培爾也操了中國話道：很好的，德國啤酒，很好很好。西安，請賈先生給我們介紹介紹。賈多才淡笑了一聲道：我作的可是銀行買賣，不販酒。威廉雖不大懂中國話、可是看出來了，培爾巳是碰了一個釘子、這就笑着向趙國富解釋了幾句，他才向賈多才道：威廉先生說，我們還是談汽車生意罷。賈多才道：我們銀行，縱然在陜西採辦農産物，也犯不上自己買汽車來搬運。趙國富道：可是往長處想，還是自己有汽車的好呀。我們的車子，不燒汽油，燒渣油，省費得多。賈多才道：縱然如此，可是現在也沒有到採辦的時候，買了汽車，也是沒用。趙國富道：便是現在不買，閣下先寫封信到銀行裏去介紹介紹，這也不要緊。賈多才道：我們總行在上海，貴處要接洽這種生意，不會直接在上海接洽嗎？趙國富聽聽他的口風、簡直無隙可乘、這就向他兩個德國主人報告了一陣。那兩人看看這情形，買賣也是無法可成，便起身告辭，賈多才因爲他們究竟是外國人，不便十分無禮只好和他們握握手，約了再會。德國人去了，賈多才對於李士廉，覺得有點面上下不來，便笑道：外國人作主意眞是厲害，一點原因沒有，就這樣硬碰硬的直上，雖然他們不過是作生意的，這一種精神，總是可以佩服的呢。他如此說着，覺得是把這番無聊舉動，可以遮蓋過去，然而這兩個德國人走來，究竟是和他增加了一些糾葛呢。（九九）</p>

<p>— 河上公</p>
<p>一九三四年的日曆，扯得沒有幾頁了：在全世界說來，一九三四年，可名之曰「暗殺年」。現在，咱來開一篇總帳吧。</p>
<p>（一）陶爾斐斯　奥國總理陶爾斐斯，在歐洲有「小拿翁」之號。七月間，竟被國社黨人暗殺。人們鑒於一九一六年世界大戰爆發的前夜，也是起於奥太子飛蝶南的被剌，星星之火，引起空前的浩刦。以爲德法世仇，德要得逞於多腦河流域，伸張勢力到南歐，奥國首當其衝。意法英俄，不願意奥入德的版圖，使奥爲緩衝地。所以陶爾斐　斯死後，意國陳兵邊境，觀察非常。這件事的後臺老闆，究竟是不是德國，到今還是疑問。</p>
<p>（二）亞歷山大　南斯拉夫國王亞歷山大一世，於十月九日，乘車到馬賽：在盛大的歡迎中，有兇手卡爾曼，突出手槍向南王射擊。南王身中四槍，隨卽斃命，這便是震動世界的「馬賽慘案」。據說，卡爾曼是瓦斯達查斯恐怖黨的黨員，有說：庆是民族爭鬭的意味，而實含有嚴重性的國際意義。現在，這事已鬧到國聯，國聯爲息事寗人起見，將締結國際公約，取締恐怖行爲。匈牙利也否認驅逐南國僑民，德國也提倡德法親善。但願這樣結束，大戰的爆發機運，不至於更表促進。</p>
<p>（三）巴爾都　法國外長巴爾都，因把己身掩蔽南三，也中彈斃命，這近十年來歐洲政治中心人物的巴爾都，竟跟南王，做了犧牲品。同時，日内瓦也損失了一個重要分子。他是很機警富辯才的政治家，也是一位著作家，這回被剌，非但是法國的損失，也確是歐洲的損失吓</p>
<p>（四）史量才　申報總經理史量才先生的被剌，國人皆認爲我國社會的一大損失，這是外國人也承認的。但，軀殼是可死的，精神是不可死的，史先生安心瞑目吧！</p>
<p>（五）基洛夫蘇聯中央執行委員基洛夫，於十二月一日，被敵黨暗殺，這是一九三四年暗殺案的結束嗎？</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我到了裏邊去一看之後，便立卽發現了許多的實證：例如謝神的匾額之多，灑掃的整潔，裝璜的富麗，在在足以表顯我所認爲滑稽可笑的故事，在當地的確有一部份人很鄭重認做是眞正的事實！他們相信在幾千年之前，眞有一頭神通非常廣大的狐狸，因爲它行止不檢，以致受了玉帝的懲戒，特地降到世上來救治人間一切疾苦，藉以懺悔它自己的罪戻。也讦就因爲他們有這一條信心的緣故，竟眞有沙人害了病，吃過仙方就好了！</p>
<p>所謂狐仙塔實在是一座很大的廟宇，同樣也有一派非常莊嚴肅穆的氣象。在那正殿上，也有一個很高大的神龕，龕前張着兩幅繡着花朶的綢幔，先前應該總是十分鮮艶美麗的，現在却己給香烟薰得很污舊了。這兩幅綢幔的中間，隠約可以看見裏面有一座朱漆金字的神位，上書「勅封青狐大仙之神位」九個正楷。神龕之下，便是一張供桌，桌上有燭臺，香爐，整日價紅燭高燒，香烟繚繞，都是那些善男信女們不斷地供給來的。</p>
<p>至於害病的人怎樣前來求治呢？這一套手續是我們中國人十九懂得的，在從前也没有什麽特殊的辦法。照樣也是一個滿盛着竹籤的籤筒給病人或他們的家屬捧在手裏，先在剛點旺的香上晃三晃，算是通神的意思，然後恭恭敬敬的磕過頭，把籤筒慢慢地，很謹慎的摇起來。（二○九）</p>
<p>毛筆雖是件小小的文具，但對於文化却巳抱過絕大的貢獻，唐宋元明，歷代詞人墨客，不是都藉了它而流傳千古嗎？假使沒有了它，那麽，他們那些佳作，又憑什麽來昭示後世呢？</p>
<p>武人用的傢伙稱爲武器：文人用的傢伙，就稱爲文具：在表面上，文具是敵不過武器的。但是，在事實上並不盡然，就以筆來說：訟師的一枝筆丨俗稱刀筆，每每在數字之間，就能致人於死，這種殺人不見血的勾當，較之武器，可說是有過之而無不及吧。</p>
<p>論理，毛筆旣有了這二千多年的文化和歷史，到現在理應更發揚而光大：然而事實却又相反，現在它在文人手裏的地位，巳漸漸的發生動摇了。代替它地位的鋼律，己慢慢的喧賓奪主，這眞是件十分可歎的事情。我們試一考究它所以如此的原因，一半固然是智識階級太屬洋化，一半也是製造者太墨守成規，不加改良的關係。</p>
<p>每天瞧了報紙上大幅的「ＸＸ鋼筆大傾銷」的廣告，不禁對這「貢獻過絕大文化的毛筆」和「靠它餬口的數萬手藝人」，憑焉興歎！</p>

<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>讀書底最大目的是「學以致用」的，不識字與沒有受過敎育的份子，在這年頭想要「免於喫虧」，除非是豐於經騐，纔能够　救其缺憾，不然，終不免陷於滅亡的。</p>
<p>不過，社會上的一般人，對於讀書的動機，有些是乖張的，甚至熱望做官，想從做官的路途上爬出來，發財啦，盧榮的獲求啦，全有啦！</p>
<p>這自然是謬誤的。</p>
<p>所以，「仕而優則學」學而優則仕」這古老的諺語雖有其相當理由的存在，但應用在現在，總嫌其次充足，假使讀書是完全想達到做官的目的，那敎育的效果未免過於單純而太可憐了。</p>
<p>對於這類似的問題，王平陵曾經編過一本「重婚」的電影劇本，由明星吳村導演製成影片，其針砭的有力，是值得我們留意的。</p>
<p>風土小誌</p>
<h3 id="c229">同光年間上海官塲的上海閒話 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>上海地方，各種各樣的人，有各種各樣的認識。那末，我們來談談清代同光年間上海官塲對於上海的見聞，許是一件有興味的事。</p>
<p>以著名的「海寗世家」子弟的身份來做上海知縣的陳其元，在他著的庸閒齋筆記裏說：</p>
<p>「上海自泰西通商後，環北門外十餘里，奏明給洋人居之，洋人歲輸其租，謂之租界。租界爲英，法，三國分踞，一切公事歸華洋同知曁三國領事會同辦理。除命盜案外，地方官不復與聞焉。」</p>
<p>這是說租界情况。雖然只是簡簡單單的幾句話，但他分明說開闢租界爲通商以後事；他也很知道開埠和開闢租界不能混爲一談的了。同光年間，上海地方官對於租界法權的關係情况，正如他所說的沒有兩樣，不過，當時情形極其繁複，他是太愛惜文字，不肯多說罷了。</p>
<p>接着，他又寫下去，說：</p>
<p>「夷夏揉雜，人衆猥多，富商大賈及五方游手之人，羣聚雜處。娼寮妓館，趁風駢集，列屋而居，倚洋人爲護符，吏不敢呵，官不得詰，日盛一日，幾於花天酒地矣。余攝縣事時，欲稍稍裁抑之，而勢有不能，嘗飭洋租地保密稽之。蓋有名數者，計千五百餘家，而花烟館及鹹水妹淡水妹等等尚不與焉。」</p>
<p>照以上所說，租界自一八五三年（咸豐三年）華洋雜居以來，到一八七一年（同治十年）陳其元做上海縣時，經過差不多二十年光景，單是娼妓，就有一千五百餘家，其他尚不在内，其畸形的繁榮，無疑的己經具體化了。</p>
<p>他接着又述說道：</p>
<p>「女女盛，巳甲於天下，乃自同治紀元後，外國妓女亦泛海而來，騷頭弄姿，目挑心招，以分華娼纒頭之利，於是中外一家。遠近裙展冶游之士均以夷塲爲選勝之。地彼洋人之漁中國財者，亦可謂無所不至焉耳。」</p>
<p>原來，西洋賣笑婦人的到達上海，乃同治年間事。他所說的「中外一家」一句話，確够當時文人所謂幽默的了。</p>
<p>其他，有一個安徽休寗人，叫余本愚的，在上海當浙江海運局總辦，係候補道台的班子。在他寫的「游泰西花園記」裏曾經寫到虹口和英租界，雖爲古董文字，當時上海租界的剪影，即所謂「夷塲景緻」，尚可想見。兹摘錄如下：</p>
<p>「乙亥孟春（按即光緒元年正月），匝月無</p>
<p>旬日晴偶值天霽，又須從事江干，以故愷到仍間，猶未覺也。隆愷臣司馬由皖中來春，假館於局。局在邑南門外，殊嫌湫隘，申臣每思北游，以海上精華咸萃於此，遠方來者，莫不耳逐神馳也。·····予偕卿雲，皖生，並拉愷臣，藜閣同肩輿至老閘。···各舍肩輿乘馬車，縱轡以行。約十餘里，至虹口屯糧處。（按即海運局附屬辦事處）樓三楹濱江而築，輪舶漕艘，喧聞在浦，無足留連。因再登車，。。。西適，自是，則一望平原，園林柳比。···遠瞰春申江，白舫烏篷，亂如飛烏·陌上車塵馬跡，華夷雜杳，電掣星馳。愷臣目所未經，不禁拍掌叫絕。忽於碧樹灣環處，車爲之停下，視同人皆踏莎而立。一時香車寳馬，錦簇花團······。路旁有方井一，又有靜安古寺，以紆道不果游。（以下述游園事從略）」</p>

<p>關於展品安全問題、物品决選後由中英委員監視包紥專家謹塡裝置、並由雙方簽封、直至倫敦展覽時再由雙方監視啓封、其裝運時除施用各項切實防護辦法外、其最重要之一次、由英海軍部屆時派軍艦、自上海護送至新嘉坡、歸途再自新嘉坡護送至上海、沿途起運裝缷及在英展覽期間、籌委會决派專門人員及幹練警衛、會同英方人員、隨時監護、以求周妥、</p>

<h3 id="c264">「書生」有用論 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— 孟加</p>
<p>曹聚仁先生感慨着書生之「百無一用」，這句話雖然好像是很深於世故，實際上却是不然的。漢宣帝之所以不用書生，爲的是一俗儒不達時宜，好是古而非今，使人眩於名實，不知所守」之故；儒林外史中的倪老爺之所以不得不要賣掉最後的一個兒子，做了三十七年窮秀才，也正「壞正讀了幾句死書，拿不得輕，負不得重」這一點上。</p>
<p>事實上，俗儒並不都是「不達時宜」的。像這樣的儒士，也實在是「表」「裏」都「俗」透了的。歷史上有不少不「俗」的儒士在。而這帮雅士們也正因此便成爲「有用」的。</p>
<p>黄仲則也許是爲了「不遇」，才有「百無一用是書生」這種牢騷。倪老爺之所以「無用」，也正是因爲他雖然一連最小的孩子也留不住」，却也只能向戲子鮑文卿訴訴苦，一點兒反抗的念頭都不曾有的緣故。</p>
<p>書生並非「無用」，不過其「用」不同而巳。</p>
<p>綸巾羽扇，聊存風雅；喝苦茶，玩骨董，躱在書齋里談狐說鬼，也只是「沒奈何」吧了。懷疑，苦悶，傷感，這正是轉換期底黑暗面的特徵。在時代的鍋爐中的殘滓，不管是輾轉呻吟的也好，一點兒不起勁癱瘓地了着緘默也好，總不過也是殘滓而巳，然而這種生活態度也還是「用」之一，因爲在客觀上，牠是帮助着舊時代底維繫的緣故。</p>
<p>然而現代的書生却並不止此。「脫下長衫」，在本質上他們巳不再是書生了：勇於凝視現實，他們懂得：「憂愁與痛苦，我們一定將有，而挣扎一定也無窮境。我們要把勇氣與痛苦打成一片，從不斷挣扎中開一條路。」他們歌着葉賽寗的詩句：「死並不困難，困難的在如何地把生活重新建起」，而投身於爲光明的奮鬥中。這樣的書生已可以說是書生的「新型」；他們已不是苦雨齋中焚香啜茗的名士了。</p>
<p>書生並非「無用」，不過其「用」不同，因而價值也異吧了。</p>
<h3 id="c265">回家 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>離開這裏那一天，照例天一亮便起了床，赤着一雙强健的脚，提了洋鐵桶上屋後冲凉去。亞滿今天有點傷感；雖然年紀巳經到了二十歲了，離家却是第一次。想着從今天起就要遠速地到星加坡丨多麽響亮的都會呵。在那裏，他將跟許許多多的陌生人接觸；他要在那家海岸邊的舖子裏整天地做着事，而且，那頑皮的琳娜是再也不能天在和她在一塊兒了。</p>
<p>（去了，什麽時候回來呢？」</p>
<p>那麽地問着自巳。</p>
<p>清晨，屋後吹着凉風。太陽還躱嬾着，沒有爬上來。一聲的雄鷄，啼醒了隔隣的琳娜。</p>
<p>他們是在一株椰子樹邊碰到了。</p>
<p>背依着樹幹的亞滿，上身也是裸着的。壯健的體魄常常敎女人不禁在心裏邊唱起讚美詩來。他把水桶放在地上，一對眼珠子釘在她的臉上。她像更加美麗了似地，頰部有一層可愛的紅暈。猛地把她抱着了，叫着：</p>
<p>「琳娜！我眞不想到星加坡去啊！」</p>
<p>「什麽？你瘋了嗎？你的父親送你到那裏去發財的。亞滿，你還沒有到過那塊地方呢，眞好玩。你可以在馬路上走半天，看看許多新鮮的東西而不想吃飯。到了晚上，更加有趣了。只是，壞女人多得很···你想着我，你要小心···」</p>
<p>說到這裏她的聲音突然低了下去。第一綫陽光射了上來，照着她的臉低垂着。亞滿用手托起她的尖下巴；突然他發現那先前泛着一重紅暈的臉上，掛　了兩行清淚。···</p>
<p>「琳娜，你哭了麽？」</p>
<p>「·····」</p>
<p>她沒有回答，只摇着腦袋。</p>
<p>「爲什麽哭？我是···你不是　　黑嬰</p>
<p>說麽，我是發財去的。你等我兩三年，我一定回來的。回來和你···」</p>
<p>「可是···」</p>
<p>「可是什麽呢？琳娜，你說吧！」</p>
<p>琳娜並沒有說，叫喚亞滿的聲音巳經在屋子裏響着了。他扔下她跑進來，父親正在穿衣裳，對着他說：</p>
<p>「火車九點鐘開，我們就要走啦。」</p>
<p>「好的。」</p>
<p>他打算換一套乾净的西裝，還要從櫉子裏取出帽子來。父親絮絮地對他說着：</p>
<p>「亞滿，你的年紀也不小了。要知道我們家裏窮，連你的媽也不能不到人家那裏去當奶媽。你到星加坡去，好好地做工，積幾個錢帶回來。···」</p>
<p>「我聽話的，你放心吧。」</p>
<p>「準備好了嗎？我們要走了」。</p>
<p>「我們走吧。」</p>
<p>於是，父潭在前面，亞滿提着大包袱走了出來。太陽巳經高高地掛在天空了，四周己遍佈着人聲。偶然回轉腦袋來，他看見隔家的門口，琳娜正對着他招乎。···</p>
<p>一個月以後的中午，熱帶所慣有的炎陽蒸晒在人們的頭頂。還是那隻包袱，那副臉孔，雖然瘦了一點。亞滿跳下了火車就直向家里走來。汗水直流在他的背上，浸透了白斜布的外衣。脚步一拐一拐地，顯得有點沉重。路旁有些人認得他，說着；</p>
<p>「那是亞滿吓。發了財麽，這末快便回來了。」</p>
<p>然而，在亞滿現在的耳朶聽來，簡直是充滿了譏剌。他難堪地噓了一聲，摸摸衣袋，只留下一塊錢光景。愈近家，他就愈失去勇氣；見到父親的時候，應當怎樣對他說他？</p>
<p>父親是盼望他積點錢回來的呵！</p>
<p>然而，他不知道星加坡己經變成了怎魔一副面目。失業，偷竊，自殺，搗亂···五年前他在那里一家洋行里做事時候的平靜早巳成爲歷史了。</p>
<p>像亞滿那麽一個不懂人情世故，生長在鄕下的馬來人，在星加坡丨丨經濟恐慌己經尖銳化的大都會里，他能立住脚嗎？</p>
<p>於是他回來了·····</p>
<p>直通家門的泥沙路他是熱息的。路旁的野草也是他所熟息的。遠遠地他望見自家的破碎的屋子了，屋後有株椰子樹。左旁的一家是琳娜：想到她，在那封滿了灰塵的嘴角，就泛起一絲笑意。</p>
<p>一手推開了門喊着；</p>
<p>「爸爸！」</p>
<p>但是沒有回應。把包袱放下來，四面地找尋着，都沒有父親的踪跡。他想，大槪是到外面去了。便跑到琳娜的家里來。</p>
<p>「琳娜！」</p>
<p>也是沒有回應。</p>
<p>琳娜的媽出來了。他抓住她就問：</p>
<p>「知道我的爸爸上那里去了？」</p>
<p>「恐怕到種植園去了。」</p>
<p>「琳娜呢？」</p>
<p>「你什麽時候回來的？」</p>
<p>聽見這穿紗籠的婦人答非所問，亞滿非常着急，睁大了眼珠子說：</p>
<p>「剛回來。琳娜那里去了？」</p>
<p>「琳娜？對了，你是問我的女兒吧。·····她前天嫁了。」</p>
<p>「嫁了！天···」</p>
<p>有一支箭射中了他的胸膛似地，他走了出來。他沒有回到家里去，只茫然在炎陽之下走着。他不知道琳娜嫁了誰；也不知道往那里去，老是順了這條沙屑路走下去。···</p>
<h3 id="c266">繭（五） <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— 林房雄原著靜子譯</p>
<p>我們睡在一個可以俯瞰古風大鐘的校舍尖塔的丘陵草上，新的銅鈕扣上返射的初夏的陽光滬和的迴照在眼廉上，我們隨便的亂談着，這時候酒井突然想起來似的說：</p>
<p>「我還有着繭子啊？」</p>
<p>「啊，你母親還在那工塲裏囑？」</p>
<p>「怎麽樣也不辭退的。他說「在你學校還未畢業以前，」，嚼着石子也要工作的」，而實際上，實在也是難以辭退。我在學校一天，我的母親就除掉進工廠以外，也沒有旁的生活方法。」</p>
<p>酒井一邊咬着嘴唇，一邊拔着丘陵上的草。他又帶着深思熟慮的口吻說：</p>
<p>「近來，我對於這世界漸漸的懷疑了。譬如那個工廠罷，在那裏現在還有三百個女工在工作着。那些人大都是從附近農村中來的十五六歲到二十三四歲的農夫們的姑娘。初來的時候，都是年青的鄕下姑娘，她們都有着很堅實的身體的，一年兩年以後，她們或是喉頭上包着白布，或是咳嗽着，或是兩眼統紅着，或是手指腐爛着，回到村裏來了。有些在工廠做工時，也有像枯草似死去的，聽說還有頭髮被機器一捲而軋死的。</p>
<p>「重濕的空氣與畫夜不息的勞工，不充分的食物丨我一看到那些日漸磨滅着年青身體的女工們，我就想起了她們正在紡績的鍋中之繭。</p>
<p>「不住的被煮着，一根眼睛也年示見的細絲，吸取」了牠的生命，漸漸漸漸的瘦小了，不久，成了一顆墨黑的蛹丨一個無用的死體，而浮出於沸湯面上。</p>
<p>「但是，另一方面，丨丨注意的看一看丨丨不是有像她們頭上轟轟迴轉着的紗綻那樣吸着繭之命而肥大的人們嗎？」</p>
<p>酒井暫時中斷了一下，揩了一揩客由的汗，又抵聲的說：</p>
<p>「在我丨丨想想也是可怕的丨丨母親在我大學畢業以前，似乎不能安然在那工廠中工作罷。在母親，幾乎是巳成爲信仰了，他總是那樣想，以爲使酒井家沒落的是自己的責任，無論如何要讓牠能再復興。不僅這樣，母親，對於我祗是一個兒子的敎育，無疑的是感到强烈的歡喜與生活之努力的。那個心緒我知道···我很知道。</p>
<p>「但是，母親在那工廠一天，不也就是那可憐蠶繭的一個嗎？眼睛看不見的細絲，吸取着牠的生命而去了····」</p>
<p>我不知道如何樣的答他。</p>
<p>高等學校的三年級生丨丨一個畢業將近的冬日。</p>
<p>深夜，酒井冒着雪到了我的公寓中。</p>
<p>「怎麽？」</p>
<p>我看了他那沒有血色，好像從墳塲中跑出來的人的面孔，直覺的打來一個不吉的豫想。</p>
<p>「母親死了！······遲了！」</p>
<p>我一邊搶着他拿出來的電報，一邊想出了他往日預言過的話，背上感着了一陣奇寒。</p>
<p>「噯！？」</p>
<p>我沒有出聲。絲廠中廻轉着絲綻的屋中看到過的那靜默而有古風的眉毛，我立刻浮想了起來，但又立刻消滅了。</p>
<p>「遲了！正月放假的時候，我曾經請求母親無論如何要把我休學。我那樣請求，我說；「不把你從工廠叫出來，不但是做兒子的不忍心，我感到迫在眼前而不可避的危險，我實在不能安心」。久别回家的我，很明白的看出了母親身體的衰壞。但是母親總哭着不聽。</p>
<p>他咬着嘴唇，用手掌揩着流下來的淚。</p>
<p>然而現在再說也沒用了。我今夜裏立刻要回去。對不起得很，請你借我一點旅費。」</p>
<p>「好！」</p>
<p>我拿出所有的錢，踏着雪，送他到了車站。</p>

<p>碼頭的方形屋頂與背後大建築物的圓周，搆成的切綫下，一羣朋友的影，是遠着，遠着，終於消隠在晚霧中了。</p>
<p>天漸漸地沉下來。才揩過眼的殘淚，感傷地嘆了一口長氣，便用戀的眼光，向着已超過視綫以外的廣州。</p>
<p>珠江下游，寛大的河道船平靜地駛去，濁黄的水拍着船身，像是作呢喃的小語似的。兩岸是低矮的堤，上面滿是荔支龍眼的樹林，濃密的間隙中，不時露出矮小的農家；舒卷的炊烟。遠遠的那邊，廣大的稻田伸展過去，倒給談墨的山崗切斷了。</p>
<p>年年帶着一顆流浪人的心，到處奔走，等到感覺厭倦城市的時候，便决然離開，像吉卜西人似的，從一個地方到一個地方。躺下去便睡着了。醒來巳到香港，太平山頂的夜色巳有點兒疲殘了。鹹腥的香港街市沉默地睡着。便借一間旅館住下，趁後天開的亞洲皇后北行。</p>
<p>船出了鯉魚門，便是藍的天，藍的海，雲和海在天邊連接着。三等艙裏的搭客畀微地忍受着左近機房播散的熱，連呼吸都不成，空氣像是一塊堅硬的固體似的凝結起來。人的頭腦昏亂，剌痛，不能睡。偶然從頭等艙中漏出爵士的音樂，可是這兒不需要這些，我們微小的希冀，便是一點風。</p>
<p>這金圓國家的船，一切都跟這社會一樣，充滿這顯然的矛盾，爲什麽頭等艙有着如此的豪興和安適，但三等艙中，却得不到一點風，這是謎；帝國主義者的謎。</p>
<p>經過乞憐的討情，這才使黄臉同胞的船員，用了仁慈的施惠於是我們有了三個風筒。這兒一個中國社會的縮影，有各種雜賭和廣東食物，更流播在這羣中間的，却有欺騙與自私。</p>

<p>丨走吧，即使你只剩下最後一口呼吸了，你也得挣扎着走到火山！不要畏難，前途即使艱難險阻到怎樣程度，你也要拚命地往前走。這是給你做人的一個最好的敎訓。如果你能走到火山，正如你將來能在沙漠般的人生裏，創造出新鮮的活躍的生命出來一般。人生的道上比這還要險阻，還要難走。但如果你拚着性命走去丨丨是的，你必得抱着這樣的志願，即使我還沒有達到目的地就中途而死去了，我也要前進的！丨丨終有一天會達到你的目的的。</p>
<p>丨丨走吧，即使是剩下最後的一口呼吸，你也應該朝着目的地前進的。</p>
<p>好容易鼓着勇氣一口氣走近了秦先生。他像很不高興地說：「你們走的太慢了，（同我一樣地落伍的，還有一位小楊。）你看人家都巳從火山歸來。還不快走，一定來不及趕船了。」我那時很想說一句：「趕不上就多停一夜吧。然而怕挨駡，而且事實也是不可能的，只好連一秒鐘都不敢停地繼續着走。</p>
<p>忽然，我的左耳朶大呌了幾聲，眼前一花，我暈到在沙子上了。</p>
<p>「趕快走吧，不要休息。」</p>
<p>秦先生毫不客氣地用棍子在我的背上抽了一下，氣得我幾乎要駡出聲來。</p>
<p>「我不是休息，實在走不動了呀！」</p>
<p>「爲什麽别人都走得動，你走不動呢？」</p>
<p>他　然用手來拖我了，而且像拖一件東西似的，毫不顧到我是個有知覺的人。爲了要想免掉他的拖和打，只好硬爭着這一口氣拖着萬千重的腿子朝着火山口挺進。</p>
<p>當一隊隊從火山上回來的男人女人，從我身邊走過時，看得他們黝黑的臉上現着許多殷紅的血跡，我心裏在想想去一次火山眞不容易，難道我受了這許多苦還不够，還要流血嗎？</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈先稳後軟軟後反漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲三角左右、坎拿大漲一角半左右、當開價後、以業外浮多、又有吸進、且洋麥微好、人心當更堅定、各月份開價、較好一分左右、以後大戸未動、浮多吐了、市氣又見步鬆、較初開落一分、迨至下午開盤、初仍平軟、後則福建帮略有收買、本月份又有北帮之抽裝、市氣復見步挺、查廠出不暢、籌碼减少、故市面一軟之後、反振亦覺容易也、結果本月份微好二厘半、一月份好一分、二月份好一分二厘半、三月份好一分七厘半、四月份好二分二厘半、五月份好二分七厘平、</p>

<p>昨日期麥上午開盤後、各月份均見清淡不前之象、以洋麥報價雖好一二角左右不等、惟以結賬巳近、業内外均多收束、故開價時、交易寥寥、價無變化、迨至下午開盤、初仍盤旋、價亦平稳、至收盤因粉市挺硬、人心稍佳、但交易則仍清淡耳、結果本月份好一分、一月份好二分、二月份好一分、三月份好三分、現麥高貨帶振一二分、中次平平、至各廠去胃、則尚活絡、開歸德麥四元零五分、次零三分、瑶灣麥四元零三分、次四元、漯河麥四元、次三元九角半、漢口麥三元八角二分、次七角九分、計阜豐去八千包、申大去三千包、華豐去一千包云、</p>

<p>昨日客秈到存兩薄、市面站住、洋米因行囤求脫、市價帶小五分、小後本街與内地胃口復活、聞出暹邏米一千五百包、西貢一號米五千包、碎米二百包、價均疲小五分、午後又山大成售出西</p>

<p>— 吹</p>
<p>一個小瘍三，偷了價值數十枚銅子的東西，便要捉將官裏去，多則拘禁一月，少亦得一星期，方才釋放，從前的法律，偷竊雖無死罪，但偷竊的價值，過了一千元以上，便應該殺頭，</p>
<p>漢文帝時，有人盜高廟坐前玉環，得，下廷尉治，釋之奏當棄市，棄市便是殺頭，文帝大怒曰，人無道，乃盜先帝器，吾欲致之族，而君以法奏之，非吾所以共承宗廟意也，該盜僅僅盜竊高帝廟中的一個玉環，文帝認爲判罪殺頭，還不滿意，定欲滅其族而後快，</p>
<p>現易培基盜竊故宫寳物，價值逾五千萬元，故宫寳物，卽爲我國家的寳物，易培基身爲故宫博物院院長，而監守自盜，竟至五千萬元之鉅，就是易培基身爲法官，自已判决，其罪當怎樣定法呢？</p>
<p>而易培基竟自己忘其爲國家的大盜，而並驕其妻妾，使其妻盛飾所盜的寳物，招摇於大庭宴會之中，（據卷此次鉅大盜寳舞弊案之發覺，因崔振華女士，窺破易培基夫人於某次宴會中，其首飾簪帶，及狐皮袍服，均爲社會罕見的珍品，故疑而偵察，結果乃破獲如是之大盜寳案，）如此易培基身爲大盜，而竟忘其爲盜，而其妻所御之物，竟忘其爲竊盜之物，而胆敢於大庭廣衆之中，公然御之，倘非喪心病狂，何竟藐法玩刑，至於如此·</p>
<p>惟信省必罰，國家大法，倘不將監守自盜的易培基，緝捕到案，置諸重典，將何以儆世之一般盜竊者？惟聞易畏懼緝捕，逃跡關外，原是可能的事實，關外雖是藏垢納污之地，但易培基盜竊國家寳物，其人格非但破産，亦早巳宣布死刑，在人家雖利其財物，偶時容留，而极本上决不會信用，在政府方面，應當竭力跴緝，務期獲案，以正國法，方足以痛快人心，而寒竊盜的胆·</p>

<p>— 詠輝</p>
<p>孩子的嘴微張着，口中的氣有出無進；百家衣穿上身巳三天了，據說百家衣是能壓邪的，但不知是什麽原故？小孩兒的病一天天的沉重起來，連百家衣也失掉了驅邪的效力。</p>
<p>「救苦救難的觀音菩薩，救救我的孩子吧，母親合着雙手放在胸前，雙膝跪在踏凳上默念着：成色不像剛才那麽死板板地，現在顯得異常慈祥地的，乞憐地的，眼皮一動一動的掉着淚。「祇要菩薩能保佑孩子的病好，我就是吃長齋，做尼姑也甘心」</p>
<p>「我再給你求求觀音娘娘好了，用不到哭哭啼啼的」。善大嫂不知在什麽時候巳踱了進來，拍着寡婦的肩膀，現出同情與關心的樣子；「我給你到觀音娘娘那裏討些香灰，降一道黄符，包你一吃就效！菩薩是最相信我的」。</p>
<p>善大嫂是這一村有名的好人，如果有人求神問卦的話，總是少不了她的：鄕下人相信她求神問卦比任何人都靈騐，因爲她是吃長齋的，而且是觀音娘娘的徒弟，丨丨據她自己說：是觀音娘娘在夢中顯聖，親口對她說的。丨丨而且她問卦的價錢也很便宜，每次祗要二百錢。</p>
<p>香灰，黄符巳下肚了！孩子的病還是沒有好。</p>
<p>「張家嫂嫂，這樣終不成話，還是請個郎中給小孩兒醫醫病吧。有好幾個鄰人這樣的勸她。</p>
<p>寡婦很不以爲然，因爲她祇有這麽一個寳貝似的孤兒，萬一吃壞了藥：有些風吹草動，一差二錯的話，敎她倚靠誰呢？她始終認爲郎中祇能診診肚皮痛那一類的小毛病，較重的病，是要敬菩薩才能治愈的：菩薩中法術最大，最靈騐的莫過於觀音娘娘，西遊記上的故事她聽得不少，孫行者那麽大的本領也離不了南海觀音，何况她呢？這兩年她眞成了觀音大士的崇拜者了。</p>
<p>百家衣不能將邪麽驅退，香灰與黄符也失掉了挽救生命的效力：在某日的一個清早，孩子竟無聲無臭地辭别了他親愛的慈母而長逝了。</p>
<p>寡婦房中站了一大堆的鄰人：你一言，我一語的勸解着，</p>
<p>「張嫂嫂，想解些，不要哭了。」</p>
<p>「人巳經死了，哭也沒用處啊」！</p>
<p>「還是預備後事吧」！</p>
<p>「這孩子我老早就知道救不活的」，善大嫂皺着眉頭，閃着灰白的頭髮，晦氣色的臉上顯得易常嚴肅。「觀音娘娘前天晚上就給了我一個夢，說這孩子是來討債的，他媽前生欠了他的債，你看，債一索完，他就去了！這是前生注定的，哭也沒用。我老早曉得養不活了的」。善大嫂這時也擠在人叢中說。</p>
<h3 id="c304">麻子陳三 <a href="#c304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— ＴＴ</p>
<p>麻子陳三·又失了業了，他鎭天唉聲嘆氣着，胃口也特别地壞，比較在榮昌燭店當伙計的時候的食量每餐差不多减少了一大碗，臉龐也日見消瘦了，顴骨高高地從起，就活像一張猴子臉。她的媽媽大來嬸也爲他這一回的失業，憔悴了許多。一方面固然是担心着米甕的米，淺到看見了甕底，而沒法塡補，可是最使她操心的，倒還是她的兒子麻子陳三一條面龐，快瘦得呌人害怕。她走到福德庵禱求過佛祖，城隍廟跪拜過菩薩，從佛祖，菩薩所賜給的籤詩上細細地考究下去，又都是說着貴人就上眼前，沒用憂心的話。佛祖，菩薩是萬靈的，最可靠的，他的話總不會錯吧；於是她便等着，等着貴人的降臨。</p>
<p>可是日子一天一天地挨過去，貴人却連影子都不得見，米也向鄰居借來了好幾次，從人們的臉色上推測下去，巳是再難開口了。</p>
<p>麻子陳三却跟娘有點不同了，唉聲嘆氣是逐漸地减少，鎭天倒是很舒快似的談天說地或同着朋友們一够兒上街觀戲劇去了，模樣兒就跟從先完全不一樣，雖則還是消瘦的。然而神氣看來却有些健旺。</p>
<p>大來嬸不消說是滿望他能够這麽地朝着快樂的路走，别把身體憂鬱壞了，不過，摸摸米甕的米，她的心又冷了一半，對於兒子的安閒，她又有點覺得不大應該了。於是她便說：</p>
<p>「也該找點賺錢的事情做，儘閒着也不是路兒的。」</p>
<p>「自然啦！不過也不是容是，找的呀！」麻子陳三一向跟媽說話，從有這麽地尖硬。</p>
<p>大來嬸的臉子一沉，鼻孔酸溜溜地說不出話來，淚水便從眼角吊下來。</p>
<p>在往昔麻子陳三瞧見媽這麽地傷心，準會安慰她一番道：</p>
<p>「用不着這樣的，緩緩想辦法就是了。」</p>
<p>然而今天却倒還拿氣給媽受，開口就尖辣辣。眼睛發火地溜出門外去。</p>
<p>大來嬸眼送着兒子的背影，想起兒子的態度，眞是變得快了，「一條穿了二三年的烏布短衫，不願再披上身上，說是太難看，頭髮梳得光閃閃，又香又滑，鎭天玩，不管·····，」大來嬸不禁嗚咽地啜泣起來。</p>
<p>麻子陳三反身進來了，後面跟着貓屎弟一羣，麻子陳三，把眼一膘，他們便默默地走着。一夥兒就圍着桌子坐着，　個腦袋碰在一起小聲地談着。</p>
<p>大來嬸想探求兒子近來的行徑，她便特意從他們的身邊走過，注心地聽。</p>
<p>「阿三，那個少的，不錯吧，臉皮滑膩膩。」貓屎弟朝麻子陳三說。</p>
<p>麻子陳三使了一個眼色，立刻空氣又歸於沉寂了。</p>
<p>可是臉皮滑膩膩這一句，在大來嬸的耳朶邊，却是特别地響亮。</p>

<h3 id="c305">失蹤案索隠 <a href="#c305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— 朱莉</p>
<p>早上，新聞紙從望平街分散開來，從每條馬路到每條弄堂，終於到了每個讀報人的手中。</p>
<p>社會新聞第二版上，載着一件二格長行的婚變新聞：主然是上海××廠陸經理的小姐。</p>
<p>據報章的記載：陸小姐是××女校的高材生，品學兼優，爲該校師長所器重。緣因十八年前，指腹成婚，匹配於陸經理同事朱某之子，現屆婚期，陸小姐反對賣買婚姻起見，故而失蹤云云。</p>
<p>這件黄色新聞就在當天下午像滬戰時一樣，每個人作爲朋友間第一句的說話資料。茶坊涁肆間，更有許多不負責任的宣傳員發表着不倫不類的謡傳。</p>
<p>第二天的早上，又見了「諸事均有辦法，見報速回·····」的廣告。</p>
<p>ＸＸ女校及ＸＸ廠内，當然論調更多，彷彿每個人對於這件案子都是十分明瞭似的，而且這兩天内之來客也擱置了個人的私事先來談談這嗎啡針的新聞。</p>
<p>於是數天之後，同時可以匯集成許多自以爲百分百凖確的該案内幕，使人無從捉摸。</p>
<p>半個月後，每個人對於這案件淡漠了；或者被更新的新聞替代了。</p>
<p>三個月後，當時對於自己的論調十分有把握的人也絕口不談起這件案件了。</p>
<p>一年以後，像設有發生過這案件似的風平浪靜了。</p>
<p>可是丨我們的陸小姐安然歸來了。</p>
<p>諸事巳有辦法丨</p>
<p>當陸小姐假裝着愁容撲到她母親懷中的時候，陸經理急忙從鎖着的梳妝台抽屜中取出那張退婚書來，一面維持着父親的尊嚴說：</p>
<p>「現在事情辦好了丨可是做女孩子的那能這般任性，被人家說起來總是不好聽的事！你也要想想你爸爸現在的地位」！</p>
<p>說罷捋着唇邊短短的鬍髭，覺得這件事處辦得很爲滿意。</p>
<p>「好了，女兒已經回來了，還多說什麽」！</p>
<p>太太在邊拍着女兒的肩膀，責備她的丈夫，這自然有她女人家的道理。</p>
<p>丨爲了女兒的失蹤，老夫妻幾次鬧翻了：陸經理認爲女兒太不顧他的地位，體面，做出這般丢人的事來。做爺的有的是錢，沒有不好曾的事，現在鬧得盡人皆知，成什麽體統丨太太倒底是心頭的肉，而且五十歲的人祗有這末一位掌上明珠。對於女兒的婚姻也同樣的不滿意，從前指腹成婚時，大家都是窮光蛋，現在老官客己是經理了，總要配一個門當戸對的女婿才對。</p>
<p>「半子之靠呵」！這是太太的道理。</p>
<p>經理是總之沒有想到這些，女兒總是别人家的人，女婿沒有錢，帶他十萬八萬去，一世還愁吃着嗎，爸爸有的是錢！自己小老婆己生了兒子，可是不能接回來，女兒還要做出這般不體面的事！</p>
<p>這樣每天吵着，鬧着，才把小老婆的事出明了爲條件辦妥了女兒的退婚。</p>

<h3 id="c307">第一天的夜裏 <a href="#c307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— 芝</p>
<p>都市，夜裏的都市，年紅的燈光在四處的閃耀着，跳舞塲門口的光輝，在吸引着有閒的，快樂的人們，紳士，少爺，一羣羣地跳進在那幽闇的大廳裏，去享樂，去陶醉在那悠揚音樂散佈着的空氣中，那四處播嚮着女人的笑聲的氛圍裏，他們陶醉着，他們享樂着，他們把世界上的一切苦腦都忘記了。</p>
<p>過慣了，都市的奢華的生活是過慣了，是看慣了，對於這些，紳士，少爺們認爲銷金的迷窟，在我已經是感到厭倦了，感到憎惡了。然而也還有些人，還沒有走進迷窟的人，在一羣羣地想進來，羨慕着他人的過着這種生活。呵！都市，都市是一個吞噬着人的熱，血咀嚼着人的骷髏的都市呵！迷戀的儘管在迷戀，沒落的儘管在沒落，可是那後面，又一羣羣地走進了這些迷戀的追戀者，一切是在輪轉着的。</p>
<p>今晚，馬路上的風括得格外兇猛，時候是將近十二點了，幾個人，幾個巳經是沒落了的青年，在沉寂的冬夜的馬路上跑着，拌擻着單薄的大衣。</p>
<p>「三十天，整整的三十天沒有來，實在是感覺另一種情調了，可不是嗎？老哥！</p>
<p>霞飛路上的安南巡捕，孤寂的在十字街頭站立着，那黑色牙齒，在那冰冷的唇裏動着，路上，那一綫筆直的燈在摇動着，幾條黑影在那裏很快的走動着。實在，在己前的深夜，是冬天也好，夏天也好，跑在這路上給我的感覺只是平凡的，可是爲了整整的三十天沒有看到，整整的三十天悶在那昏暗的地方，今晚，尤其是這樣冷靜的深夜，實在另有一種新鮮的感想，何况還是要去那沉醉着的塲所。</p>
<p>馬路上，沉寂的馬路上，風在吹着，四處的角落裏，黑暗的魔手在伸張着，黑暗的角落裏有那抖擻着的呌化子在與寒氣作鬥爭，在那一輛二輛的汽車裏，一樣的也是黑暗着，可是那裏面播出來的却是女人的嬌婉的媚笑。除了這兩種不同的聲音，就只有我們幾個人脚下的皮鞋在路面答答地嚮着。</p>
<p>「快到了吧？實在有點耐不住了，酒氣在向上面昇。。</p>
<p>沉入在半醉中的王。似乎是跑得太吃力的在自語着，可是當他說定了，幾個人，巳經走進那沉入在幽闇的燈光裏的境地了，音樂聲在耳朶中嚮着。</p>
<p>「不會想到吧？今晚這裏，昨晚還不是在·····」</p>
<p>當我坐定下來，心廟才感到了一陣舒適的當兒，昌打着我的肩膀，笑着的說了。</p>
<p>「哈，也許是吧！人生也不過如此而巳吧了，朝夕的變換是無定的，三十天，也許就是一塲夢，今晚······」</p>
<p>使人沉醉，使人迷戀的聲嚮在四面的波蕩着，一切男的，女的，年青的，年老的，都在這迷醉的聲嚮中享樂的跳躍着，消磨着那一秒一刻的光陰。可是我，一切只有令我厭倦，令我孤獨，世界上一切的地方，在我只是感到了一樣的厭倦了。生活，那黑暗，寂寞，苦悶的生活，在我，只有永遠地，一直到了軀體再也不能動了的那一刹那的在漫長着。</p>

<p>— 細流</p>
<p>你們覺得你們心愛的電影明星，總是一看就認的。但是請你等着吧。</p>
<p>不久之前，有一大隊的中毒甚深的影迷，跑到好萊塢遊玩。他們係由一家大公司，特别供給了一個嚮導！丨照例係一個口才便給英俊青年丨丨領導着他們，在公司裏各處巡視着。他們不久走到了一個明星的化妝室前面。那裏停着一輛亮晶晶的黑漆大汽車，一個車夫坐在裏面等着。一回兒一個女郎大踏步的，從一大隊的遊各身旁擦過去，跳上了汽車開走了。那一大隊的遊衆，對那個穿着長褲子，頭髮蓬鬆的女郎，連第二眼都不看。你猜她是誰？她就是明星狩獵團所欲得而甘心的，影迷們所最要尋覓的，瑞典女郎葛雷泰嘉寳！他們眼睁睁看着她走過去，要是他們看出了她是誰，她還能安然踏上汽車逃走嗎？最奇怪的，連那位公司裏的年輕嚮導，都沒有看出她是誰。他後來私自告訴人，他在公司廟多年，他從來沒有看見過葛雷泰嘉寳。但是他眞的沒有看見過呢？還是看見了而不認識呢？</p>
<p>所以，我勸一般朋友們，你們千萬不要隨便和人打賭，以爲明星們一過眼，就看得出來的，或是以爲老遠看見了却利卓别麟，如同航海看見了燈塔，一定會認識的。有一次，一個大馬戲班去到好萊塢，卓别麟帶了他的兩個小孩去看馬戲。他和兩個小孩子，一同坐在頭等座位裏，一面吃着花生，一面說着笑着。她旣沒有裝小鬍子，亦沒有帶圓禮帽，旣沒有帶小手杖，亦沒有穿着破皮靴和破褲子。他亦安然坐着看戲，四座的人沒有一個認識他的，又誰知他就是千萬人所崇拜的笑匠呢？</p>
<p>就是在好萊塢的著名的餐廳之中，你準備着要見到許多明星的，明星們亦會從你鼻子下面鑽了過去，你一些都沒有知道的。有一天薛爾維亞雪妮戴了一副黑眼鏡，坐在公司裏的餐廳午膳，她坐了半天沒有一個人認識她的。後來喬治賴甫脫叫着她的名字，人家只才知道她是誰。可是她被人家發現之後，她亦立即站了起來逃走了。嘉寳的衣着，亦是極平常，一些不引起人家注意的。有一次有一個海軍軍官，到一家公司裏買白帆布袴子。同時有一個女郎亦在買同樣的東西。那個朋友故意搶在女郎的前面買，並且故意挑撿了許久、讓她多等一回。等到他買完了，買走開的時候，才發現那女郎不是别人，就是赫赫有名的葛雷泰嘉寳。他在無意之中，却弄送了她半天。</p>
<p>女明星比較男明星，更爲難認些。人家說，豹身上的斑點，是不會變的。但是女人最會變。中國人說，女兒十八變，臨上轎，變三變。現在好萊塢的女明星，祇要將頭髮改換一個式樣，穿一身舊衣服，戴上一副黑眼睛，簡直你就分不出她是誰。况且每一個女明星　還有多少少摩倣她的人。她們亦都穿上舊衣服，戴上了黑眼鏡，使你無從辦别誰是眞明星，誰是假明星了。安娜史丹出門的時候，臉上是些粉石搽的。她的頭髮蓬蓬鬆鬆，從小帽子下面露了起來。你看見了她，祇當她，祇甚她是個附近學校裏的一個漂亮女學生。梅蕙絲亦不載金鋼鑽。她穿着一條長袴，上身罩着一件絨衫。誰會知道她就是以風騷轟動全國的大明星呢？琪恩哈羅尤其難認，因爲摩倣她的人太多了。許多臨時女演員妝扮者琪恩哈羅，比她自己還要像哩。并且銀頂的女郎，一天比一天多，但是眞正的銀髮女郎，却祇有一個。幾年以前，葛羅麗亞史璜蓀故意地穿上了一套舊衣服，頭髮另梳了一個樣子，跑到她幾家公司裏去找事做。她說她的名字叫羅澈麗葛雷。她跑了好幾家，沒有一家肯收用她的。他們都說她的樣子不興。那個時候，葛蘿麗亞正是紅極的時候，但她穿了一身破舊的衣服，居然沒有人認識她了。</p>
<p>此外一個女明星，一定有幾個替身丨丨就是形貌和正角相似的人，公司裏用來在必須的明星，代替明星的，亦是用來恐嚇明星，使她不敢過於倔强的。這些替身，走在馬路上，　一般獵取簽字的人，都拿她們當作眞正的明星。等到他們看見了眞正的明星，反覺得她們是假的了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c315">評「飛花村丨金城」 <a href="#c315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴　唐納</p>
<p>作爲暴露影片而出現的「飛花邨」，在「春潮一的作者的表現中，未嘗不是進步的表示。從「春潮」的戀愛哀歌到「飛花村」的揭露社會的黑暗，這中間的距離是很遠的。每一個小布爾作者常常如此，他對於戀愛的悲哀與歡樂，感覺很大的興趣，可是等到殘酷的現實給與他不斷的打擊之後，粉紅色的幻夢，不能不慢慢的消逝，然後給逼迫着走上積極的前途。即是說若干程度的正視着現實，在作品中反應着對於社會現狀的不滿和憤怒。</p>
<p>很顯明的，作者在「春潮」中，他展開了愛的幻滅。王人美希望得着美滿的愛情，（因劇中人名字巳忘，暫以演員的名字代用。）高占非也是很熱情的，可是經不了情慾之魔的李麗的裴擊，毁滅了她們的愛情，跟着她們的生命也和愛情一同死滅了。於是作者，哭泣的歌唱着「甜蜜的夢，回來罷！」而那夢是永遠不再回來。在那裏展開了愛的悲劇，然而僅僅是愛的悲劇而巳，沒有超越愛的範圍而作爲社會眞實之積極的反應而存在。不過愛的甜夢對於作者確是毁滅了的。在第二部作品的「飛花村」中，他便楊葉了愛的幻夢，而在村婦的賣花聲中，透現了站長之流的高貴的人們之醜態，他們渴饑着淫慾，私販違禁的。另一方面胡萍飾的賣花女郎，當　們還要努力生活下去的時候，她們連做工都沒有可能，除了賣肉之外是不能生活下去的，何况還要救濟丈夫和女兒的貧苦。這樣題材的採取與主題的决定，確是比較「春潮」有着若干積極的進步。</p>
<p>但是作者對於女人，對於所謂愛與慾仍然感覺很大的興趣，所以他决定胡萍是以賣花爲職業，花和女人總不肯分離。同樣，對於鹹肉莊的風光也花費了不少膠片，····這些和「春潮」中的一切，仍然有着十分相近之處。當然我們並不說對於這種題材不能能採取，而是以此說明作者的作風與傾向。</p>
<p>另一方面說，作者很歡喜悲劇的創作。「春潮」固然是悲劇，而這「飛花村」在故事進展上，　胡萍和高占非未嘗不可以得着比較完好的收塲，可是他始終將她死了，以完成他悲劇的結尾。</p>
<p>現在，我們來看他是怎樣的表現吧。他和許多的中國作品一樣，採用了迂緩的ＴＥＭＰＯ表現中國人的生活習慣。但是作爲電影藝術的表現，在鄕村的而比較和平的境遇中，這迂緩的ＴＥＭＰＯ是可以適用的，可是當表現都市的時候，却覺得高速度的表現紛亂，煩　較爲適當。而人物動態的高速度的强化，正是二十世紀三十年代最尖端的表現。就這一點來說，一飛花村」在後半部的速度却嫌太慢了，最顯着的如胡　　　警察捉到了王乃東走進法庭時，她也沒有速度的奔跑，而整個的調子的慢，更不待言。幸而有配音帮助不少，不過到底沒有緊張起來。</p>
<p>其次要說到的便是ＭＯＮＴＡＧＥ的不够熨貼，如高占非在火車中相打，不見他倒在地上，便接醫院。又如高占非打胡萍時對於窗外閒看的人，突然加上，都是剪接的不當，以致失了空氣不够把握。他如三條綫的並行發展覺得錯亂，特别是胡萍到都市，加以細膩的描寫，而高占非到都市却輕輕地放過，更可見作者觀念之一班。</p>
<p>當然，雖然有了這些缺憾，並不能掩沒作者努力的用心。如韓莊的空氣，以及對於劇中人個性的把握，都有很好的成績。同時胡萍·高占非，葉娟娟，王乃東都是很好的演員。特别是王乃東演技的沉着老練，更使人驚異。而從來不被人們重視的葉娟娟，在這裏因着導演良好的指導，也有極好有成績。</p>
<p>此外，攝影和佈景的努力，都使這一影片獲得不少成績。在此又可以證明中國影片在技術上確是不斷的進步。我們這一九三四的年尾，由於害一影片而對於一九三五年有着熱烈的期望。</p>

<p>— 尤競</p>
<p>The　Affairs　of　Voltaire</p>
<p>－國泰開映－</p>
<p>關於法蘭西十八世紀的藝術巨匠，文豪伏兩泰，我想簡括地引用下面的話來說明：</p>
<p>「···伏爾泰的哲學觀點是繼承着洛克的感覺論爲出發的　對於十八世紀唯物論的發達上，不曾有多大的影響。但是他對於天主敎，以及宫庭學問的攻擊，他的批評諷剌之類的書籍，却有着特殊的意義。這些，不但爲法蘭西十八世紀的無神論開闢了大路，對於革命亦有着很大的責獻。可是他是個「沙龍」無神論者，因爲他同時以爲宗敎對於愚民是必要的丨可以抑制民衆野蠻的情慾，而且維持啓蒙老對於愚民的支配，是一種强有力的宗敎。這一點表現着他的意德沃洛基是布爾喬亞的貴族自由主義的」。</p>
<p>在銀幕上映出的「筆戰强權」中的伏爾泰，是一個正義感的進步作家，他看不慣路易十五王朝的荒淫，和財政大臣沙那伯爵等的横征暴歛，與攬權弄勢。他在民衆飢餓死亡的哭聲與挣扎中，爲人道正義和自由，犧牲着自己病弱的身子，緊决地寫作代一般無辜的蒼生呼喊的小册子，編著暴露人民苦痛與强權者之淫威的劇本。他不怕觸怒帝王和侫臣的忌劾。也不惜身入地獄丨最有名的一拔司鐵爾牢獄去和當時的一般先覺者度着最黑暗，亦最光榮的生活。可是正義畢竟是正義，不會倒流的歷史作了最公平的裁判者，一時被焚燒的著作與摧毁的銅像，終於會爲整千累萬的呼喊着一「麵包」「正義」與「自由」的羣衆所擁護，所奉供的。</p>
<p>有點美中不足的，便是由於劇作者處理這一偉大的材料的手法問題。他太顧慮了劇本進展的故事性，把皇后的尊重與信仰伏爾泰寫得太神化。伏爾泰對路易，對沙那的態度，寫得正義感勝於智警的手腕，敎我們有如看到中國劇中的昏君，奸臣們與忠義正直的丞相或御史在爭鬥似的。</p>
<p>導演喬治亞倫與演伏爾泰的喬治亞利司，都是有着極太的成功的。其餘演王，后，沙那與南迦小姐等都沒有辜負伏爾泰這個名字。對話的警惕，織接的嚴密，光綫攝影與音響效果，以及各人的演藝等，可惜本文限於篇幅，不能詳細也叙述了。</p>

<p>— 素華</p>
<p>蘇麗亞揭起了一角面紗從樓梯上的小窗偷看着唐爾納在小徑上很愉快的吹着口。一直等到他跳過了牆頭，她才懶洋洋的踱回寢室去。她換。她換上了睡衣，行近那靠着花園的窗口，輕輕的唱着歌。起初她祇是輕輕的唱，後來竟忍不住引吭高歌了。忽然花園牆外又有歌聲，是男子的聲音，無疑地是唐爾納了。</p>
<p>等到歌聲停止了，蘇麗亞才回轉過來。她躺在床上一會兒便對女僕道：「叫秘書把一個叫唐爾納的地址查來給我。」可是那三個女侍竟同聲告訴她說他是住在皇后路五十二號的樓上。蘇麗亞紅着臉說道：「謝謝你們，那是不要緊的，現在沒有什麽了。」侍女向她道了晚安便退了出去。好在床上反覆的睡不着，就披了睡衣起來，去翻開她的日記，急急地寫。不久，她寫完了，很快活的說道：「我把它通通寫出」來了，不會存在心裏。我快就要把它忘記的。」</p>
<p>可愛的陽光和着溫暖的輕風，像是把昨晚的事留着一樣，使蘇麗亞不能忘記。她希望日子快些過去。又是月上柳梢的時候，她又踱出花園去。坐在石凳上無意識地等着。一小時兩小時都過去了。她無精打采地踱了回去。在床上躺了一會，又去寫她的日記。她寫：「我巳把他忘記了。」</p>
<p>一天又過去了！晚上的月兒無恙，花園仍是一樣的幽靜，她睡前一樣的寫她的日記。但是到了第二天蘇麗亞就有些異樣了。萬種思潮，無目的地擁上心頭。她把窗都關上，隔絕一切快愉的剌激。寡居和面紗可以消滅整個的青春，憂怨的情緒充滿着她整個心靈。那些軍士唱的動人歌曲，像是有意的從窗隙中透入她的耳鼓裏。她再耐不住了。站起來猛拉了一下呼喚僕人的帶子，急忙的從抽屜裏拿出唐爾納的信奮恨地把牠焚掉。她知了，因爲她知道一切的悲慘生活可以和着這封信同時化作烏有。當女侍進來的時候，那些黑衣服都給她扯碎了。口裏還喊着：「快些把我的新衣服新東西通通拿來，我們明天到巴黎去！」</p>
<p>蘇麗亞到巴黎，給了馬蘇維亞國一個絕大的恐慌。關於蘇麗亞在巴黎的行徑，無時不在打聽着。不是說某公爵和她訂婚，就是說某王子向她求愛。無疑地，蘇麗亞現在是一位風流寡婦了。馬蘇維亞的人，天天都慌恐着，怕她會在巴黎結婚。她一結婚，她在馬蘇維亞的財産不一定隨着去了，馬蘇維亞就要破産了。那時國王耶密，爲着這事要開内閣會議，想要挑選一位英俊溫柔的密使，去到巴黎向風流寡婦獻媚，使她不致嫁給外邦人。齊巧這時王后陶樂茜和御衛軍隊長唐爾納幽會着，被國王耶密撞破了。國王於憤恨之餘，就心生一計，派唐爾納到巴黎去面見柏夫大使，權充着馬蘇維亞的密使。唐爾納一到巴黎，行李在飯店裏還沒有整理好，就喊着穿禮服，要到麥茜跳舞塲去，連大使都不去見了。他到了麥茜，因爲吻女人和一個人爭風吃醋，不想那人就是柏夫大使。後來給大使知道了，就拉他到了一間靜僻的房間，和他說道：「這是國家重要的秘密。明晚在大使館給她開一個跳舞會。」唐爾納故意問道：「她美麗嗎？」大使答道：「爲了她的財産，她一定是美麗的，不過無論你歡喜她與否，你也要愛她。明晚你來大使館，我就給你介紹。你想這辦法好嗎？」唐爾納興奮地答應了，就往外跑。（未完）</p>

<p>— 呆</p>
<p>在不景氣聲中。英美各汽車廠。雖在表示一九三四年之汽車事業。已入復興之途徑。然所受不景氣之影響。尚未完全復原。則我人又不可加以否認者也。是故英美各國。汽車業中。尚能支撑門面者。固大不乏人。而因周轉不靈。宣告清理。或相互歸併者。亦大有人在耳。法國之汽車事業。本較英美爲落後。而國内之汽車工廠。當推雪鐵龍爲巨擘。乃在不景氣象動盪之世界中。此法國汽車巨擘雪鐵龍廠。竟以清理聞矣。愈見經濟危機之日甚一日也。</p>
<p>自雪鐵龍廠清理之消息。宣佈而後。廠主雪鐵龍氏。卽進謁法總理弗蘭亭。面陳廠方經濟困難之情形。其初政府方面。本有予以援助。勿使倒閉之意。蓋雪鐵龍廠。在法國本爲規模較大之車廠。所僱職工頗多。萬一倒閉。又將使法國增加一批失業者也。乃結果因議員方面。有一部分表示反對以政府之公欵。扶助私人之事業。於是所謂援助云者。巳爲空言。而雪鐵龍廠。將有清理之可能也。</p>
<p>雪鐵龍廠。近年以來。所産汽車。亦日見進步。且以法國環境。趨向華美之故。雪鐵龍車。製造方面。對於車身。特别考究。據云一九三四式雪鐵龍車。單就各種之車身之式樣。有九十種之多。雪鐵龍車。行銷各地者。大抵以十匹馬力。大十二匹馬力。及十二匹馬力三種爲多。去年一年之中。上述三種車輛。銷售於各地者。有六萬輛之多。各地車主。對於雪鐵龍車。駕駛之後。莫不表示滿意也。</p>
<p>在雪鐵龍歷史之上。各地舉行之展覽會中。所得第一名之錦標。先後已有十八次之多。他如法國各地。所舉行之汽車競賽。雪鐵龍亦曾造過不少最高紀錄。卽國際汽車競賽中。據法國汽車恊會之正式報告。雪鐵龍四缸及六缸汽車。在法國及國際方面。曾造法國紀錄一百三十四次。世界紀錄二百四十一次。雪鐵龍車之成績如何卽此亦可見一般矣</p>
<p>以一九三四式輕便十二匹馬力雪鐵龍新車而言。速度最高時每小時可達六十八哩。且每小時自八哩起。在三十六秒鐘内。可加速至五十哩。加速力之濃厚。要亦爲一般汽車所不及者。加速旣簡便輕易。速力又屬極高。是故一般車主。如喜輕快汽車者。莫不購雪鐵龍車也。他如塞車之有力。外觀之華美。底盤之厚重。皆爲雪鐵龍之特殊優點。故一九三四式雪鐵龍新車。問世而後。風行各地。大得一般車主之歡迎。乃今者此法國各廠。以清理聞矣。如成事實。則爲法國汽車業前途一大損失也。</p>

<p>柏林車展日期巳定　歐美各國的大都市。一到歲尾年首。多舉行汽車展覽會。把新式的汽車。分門别類的陳列起來。便利購衆的比較和選擇。法良意美。也是一年一度的社會盛事。好像美國的紐約哩。英國的倫敦哩。法國的巴黎哩。那一處沒有汽車展覽會。到時候萬人空巷。大有舉市若狂之感。德國柏林的汽車展覽會。現在已經决定在明年舉行。日期也已擇定從一九三五年二月十四日到二十四日。展覽的日子一共是十天。在往年。柏林車展的會塲。一共佔兩個大廳。明年因爲參加陳列的車商增多。所以地位也跟了要擴充。凡是大展覽會塲中連接的各廳塲。都要使用着。這些廳塲都是由接通大路的間道和舊廳接通着的。據說這個地方。對於車輛的展覽是非常適宜的。明年會塲的佈置。將和以往幾次相同。各式的汽車和零件等都分成爲幾個大部份。因之私用客車和商用運貨車是要分兩處陳列的。</p>
<p>倫敦印度汽車旅行　最近凱雷脫大佐和他的夫人及兩友。作倫敦印度間的長途汽車旅行。據目下所得的消息。他們一行在途間進行很順利。他們所用爲代步的是兩輛二十丨七。的喜臨門遊行車。現在已經越過耶路撤冷。到達巴格達附近地點。照他們沿途經歷的日記看。從倫敦到耶路撤冷。路程共達三千四百二十三英里。他們行車的速率平均爲每小時二十三英里。這一段路中間有許多地方是異常乾燥的塵沙道路。汽車駛行頗不容易。所以在這樣情况之下。這兩輛喜臨門車有此成績。倒也是件不容易的事哩。</p>
<p>英國福特廠之革新　福特的新式富麗車。機力充足式樣美觀。而售價中庸。因之供不應求。一時需要甚殷。英倫達勒漢地方的福特車廠。爲適應需要和大量生産起見。特爲將原有的造車工塲加以改造革新。在兩星期的時間中。巳經把那原裝在廠中重有一千二百磅的機件。拆缷下來之後從新裝過。還有長可四。拆缷下來之後從新裝過。還有長可四分之三英里的單軌運輸車。也從新加以改造。以求符合新生産的計劃。美國福特公司對於一九三五年的新計劃。其投資總額達八三·○○○·○○○鎊。預計在這一年中要造成一·○○○·○○○輛的新汽車哩。</p>
<p>固特異之爪哇分廠　美國固特異車胎橡皮公司近擬在爪哇之盤登查地方設一分廠。預計每日之生産力量爲橡皮外輪胎及内胎各三百個。其開工日期當在一九三五年之五月一日。屆時所僱工人約須二百人。廠址長約四百六十尺。寛約二百尺。大部份作開敞式。他的建築材料完全用鋼料。最適宜視熱帶地的機械工塲。原料堆置房和烘乾房都建在屋内。設有窗戸。引擎和爐子間。爲安全起見。和大部份的廠房分隔。不相連接。廠址的所在地是一個廣二十八英畝的橡皮種植塲。四週有六宅新式的住屋。給工程師和管理人員居住的。這個爪哇分廠是固特異在外國分設的第五廠。他們的所在地爲加拿大。英國。澳大利亞。和　根廷。至於原有的各廠。是在阿克龍。哇海華。樂士安極立斯。和亞拉司加的極司騰等處。爪哇分廠的主腦人爲哈特萊氏。他在遠東多年。經騐是很充足的。</p>
<p>英國的抑聲運動熱　關於抑聲運動一件事。在英國各地都是非常注意的。尤其在閙市和大都會裏。地方人士爲保持公衆的安靜起見。對於這件事十分的努力。並澈底的要求到一個根本解决方法。關於這件事的開始。是由英政府運輸大臣培立休氏所發動的。並且還有一個委員會。由亨利福勒爵士做主席。裏面的委員有科學家有汽車和機器脚踏車的製造家。他們唯一的目標。是要考慮和查究怎樣機械推進車輛會發生可厭的聲息。和用什麽方法可以除去或减少這種聲息的生出。在汽車製造商方面。他們對於汽車聲息的减少工作。巳經在巳往數年間費去了不少心血去研究。可是要待改進的地方還是很多。最近知道斯樂夫地方的勃司托培爾行對於抑聲方法的試騐。是曾經費很大的工夫的。他們現在所研究的。是要證明石棉是否能减除汽車的聲息。石棉這樣東西含有避火和隔音的特質。所以近代建造房屋上採用的地方很爲不少。有些人主張用石棉來做車頭帽蓋的襯裏。尤其是舊車應該用這件東西。原因是車子愈舊。聲音也愈大。如果用石棉來襯裏。那末最低限度。總可以把聲音遏閉在帽蓋内。不敎他透傳出來。</p>
<p>派克山峯高爬紀錄　美國科羅萊杜泉附的派克峯高爬比賽。每年都要舉行一次。在這種塲所駕車。確是件很困難的事情。卽使不講紀錄的時間。就是要令汽車上昇至山峯也是件不容易的事。他如繞行高谷山徑。不臨千丈深淵。都是敎人不寒而慄的。今年第十六届常年比賽。在美國勞工日舉行。參觀的人途爲之塞。在敞車組中。羅意絲恩塞以十六秒又十分之一八高佔頭標。他所駕乘的是格林乞爾直的司德士特號車。比了舊有的錦標。超過幾達一分鐘之多。福特Ｖ式三輛常備車。打破原有的常備車紀錄。而時間最短的要推哈蒙車。他所費的時間祇有十九分二十五又十之七秒。這些駕駛人能有這種驚人的成績。無疑的是靠他們的駕駛技術和車上的機速力量等。不過有一件事。也值得吾們注意的。就是敞車和常備車組各車都用强兵發火塞。功效十分優美。</p>
<p>司蒂倍克武裝汽車　上月初。美國南朋地方的司蒂培克廠。造好一輛完全鋼甲的武裝汽車。這部車子是總統號八缸特造式轎車。預備給警署中人用的。這輛車子的最大特色就是全部可以避彈。除了子彈可以從地板上穿入車廂之外。其他像車頂車首和車旁等任何方向。子彈都不能穿入。因爲車廂四週是用避彈鋼所圍築的。車窗用厚一寸的避彈玻璃。風屏翼也有避彈作用。至於置槍的四個槍位。可以自動關閉。且用橡皮夾造。後有回力震碎玻璃的危險。車輪前也用避彈鋼絲保護着。散熱器四週一樣的用鋼絲保護。所以萬無一失。</p>

Request for review and instruction. Amended and passed, submitted to the National Government for record. (Central Telegram, 25th) (Nanjing) The Executive Yuan meeting appointed Liu Wenhui and four others as members of the Xikang Provincial Construction Committee. The issue of establishing Xikang Province was first proposed by Xue Dubi during his tenure in the 17th year of the Republic, suggesting that it be converted into a province along with six other areas: Ningxia, Qinghai, Suiyuan, Chahar, and Rehe. Over the years, Ningxia, Qinghai, Suiyuan, Chahar, and Rehe have been converted into provinces one after another. Xikang has not been converted due to special reasons. When Liu Wenhui was the Military Governor of Sichuan, the Central Government also sought Liu's opinion on this matter. Liu believed that Xikang was closely related to Sichuan and that if Sichuan was not unified, the establishment of Xikang Province would be of no benefit. In addition, the disputes between Kang and Tibet were unresolved, making it practically difficult. When the Central Government sent Special Envoy Huang Musong to Tibet, he passed through Kangding, inspected the situation there, and felt that Xikang definitely needed to be established as a province. He then telegraphed the Central Government, requesting the prompt establishment of the Xikang Provincial Government. After receiving the telegram, the Central Government again sought the opinions of Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui, both of whom expressed their support. Thus, preparations were immediately started. Recently, when Liu Xiang came to Nanjing, he had further discussions on this matter. As a result, the reorganization of the Sichuan Provincial Government and the establishment of Xikang Province were both decided at the Executive Yuan meeting. However, the announcement was delayed until the 25th due to issues regarding the number of committee members and the selection of candidates. The five members of the Provincial Construction Committee are currently scattered in five locations. Liu Wenhui resides in Ya'an on the border of Sichuan, which is eight stations away from Kangding. The Executive Yuan's decision has already been telegraphed to Liu. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Two Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Judicial Administration Have Been Internally Decided <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Hong Ludong is appointed as the Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and Xie Jian as the Permanent Vice Minister. The announcements will be made soon. (Special Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the appointment of Wang Yongbin as Minister of Judicial Administration, Xie Jian is internally designated for the position of Political Vice Minister.

<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shaogui, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance to Sichuan Province, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the 25th to pay respects to Premier Wang and seek instructions. Chen stated that the primary purpose of his trip to Sichuan is to reorganize national taxes. Subsequently, all national taxes in the province will be collected and remitted to the national treasury by the Special Commissioner's Office, and local authorities will not interfere. If local tax revenues are insufficient to cover local administrative expenses and military expenditures for suppressing bandits, the national treasury will allocate additional funds separately. The second purpose is to reorganize local finances, first by conducting investigations in various regions and then formulating a transitional reorganization plan with the Department of Finance for submission to the Ministry for approval and implementation. The Special Commissioner's Office plans to be established in Chongqing and later moved to Chengdu. Other matters, such as improving the currency system and establishing a mint, will be decided after arriving in Sichuan. He is scheduled to return to Sichuan by boat on the morning of the 26th.

<p>Li Zonghuang Reports on the Course of the Uprising</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a commemoration of the Yunnan Uprising at 9 a.m. on the 25th, attended by Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Zhu Jiqing, Wang Qi, Li Zonghuang, Jiao Yitang, Wang Luyi, Li Ciwen, and all staff members, totaling about 500 people. Ju Zheng presided. The Central Government originally designated Yang Jie to report, but due to Yang's absence, Li Zonghuang was appointed instead. Li presented "The Course of the Yunnan Uprising and the Understanding That Should Be Had," stating that in the fourth year of the Republic, Yuan Shikai plotted to restore the monarchy and become president himself. In addition to Chen Qimei leading an expedition against Yuan in Shanghai, the soldiers and civilians of Yunnan also raised the banner of revolt and dispatched troops. Tang Jiyao declared independence, organized the National Protection Army, and welcomed Li Liejun and Cai E to Yunnan to preside over military affairs. They attacked Xufu and Luzhou. Generals in Guizhou, Sichuan, and other places responded to the call. Soon, troops from various provinces rose up one after another and defeated Yuan's forces. Subsequently, Navy Commander Li Dingxin joined the expedition against Yuan, leading to Yuan's defeat and the restoration of the Republic. The success of this uprising was due to several reasons, which we should recognize: (1) The people of Yunnan have a habit of being honest, hardworking, and courageous; (2) There was the leadership of a great leader; (3) The strategy for suppressing Yuan was determined by the Premier, and the officers and soldiers of the National Protection Army were able to absolutely adhere to the ideology. We should all emulate this spirit to save the country from its current difficulties. The meeting adjourned after the speech. (Central News Agency Telegram, 25th)</p>

It is rumored that Feng Shouchuan's troops, commander of the war zone security supplementary team, will take unfavorable actions against the militia, so all the people in the town are restless, and traffic in and out of the town is virtually cut off.

(Special Dispatch, 25th) (Tianjin) Wang Bingxiao, captain of the Yutian Ya Hongqiao militia, was arrested by the Japanese team in Tangshan and has not yet been released. The reason for the arrest is that Feng Shouchuan, the chief of the war zone security supplementary team's intelligence team, falsely accused Wang's unit of abusing and killing two Japanese people and of anti-Japanese behavior to the Japanese team in Tangshan. After Wang was arrested, the Japanese side sent Trustee Hasegawa Zan and Zhang, a counselor from the Luanyu Commissioner's Office, to Ya Hongqiao on the 23rd to investigate. They learned that a scoundrel from the town, Wang Guang'en, had been killed by the militia for his bad behavior and secretly buried in Niugezhuang in the third district. Feng Shouchuan actually tried to frame Wang Bingxiao by twisting the facts. Hasegawa and others exhumed the grave for inspection, and Japanese and Korean people present at the time proved that there was no abuse of Japanese people. They have returned to Tangshan to report.

<h3 id="e22">Constant Observation of Japanese-Russian Relations <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, Japanese-Russian relations have once again become tense. According to a Harbin telegram on the 22nd, Japan and Russia were engaged in troop movements and deployments to compete for a small island near Dongning, and the situation was quite serious. The next day, Japanese telegrams claimed that a hundred or so Russian soldiers were digging trenches near Dongning and were all captured. On the same day, Russian telegrams claimed that a Japanese military officer had infiltrated Russian territory to take maps and was captured by the Russians. This kind of tense state is the most intense seen in months. If either side really had intentions of war, it would not be difficult to use this as a pretext for war. However, neither Japan nor Russia has denied that their personnel were captured, nor have they expressed any attitude. On the contrary, they seem to be outsiders and not at all indignant, which seems very strange. However, since the September 18th Incident, Japanese-Russian relations have been strained, and have repeatedly been on the verge of crisis. The waxing and waning, and the easing and tightening of tensions have occurred more than once. Finally, the storms have subsided and passed peacefully. Judging by this, the current conflict between the two sides is similar to past precedents, and its insignificance is not worth mentioning. It is appropriate that neither side attaches importance to it.</p>
<p>There are also reasons why Japan and Russia have repeatedly created incidents but have never resorted to war. The biggest reason is that when Japan was fighting in the Northeast, Soviet Russia took the opportunity to strengthen its defenses in the Far East. A small-scale mobilization would have no chance of success. In addition, fighting against Russia cannot be accomplished merely by relying on courage and vigorous advance. At the same time, it is also necessary to take into account the Soviet Air Force's offensive and worry about the air defense of one's own rear. Therefore, Japan is still hesitant about fighting against Russia and takes an extremely cautious attitude. Conversely, Soviet Russia also has many concerns about waging war against Japan. Furthermore, judging from today's situation, it can be concluded that any conflict will not expand. Firstly, it is now winter, and the Japanese are at a disadvantage in fighting against Russia. Secondly, the struggle between Stalin's faction and Trotsky's faction in Soviet Russia has been revived, and internal difficulties are deep. They will probably not take any external action. Thirdly, both sides are still in the era of deploying their transportation lines based on military needs. The conditions for war have not yet fully matured. Fourthly, Japan's current military strength in Northeast China is more than sufficient for self-defense, but probably insufficient for attacking others. Therefore, if Japan really wants to use force against Russia, it seems that it must carry out a large-scale mobilization. There must be signs of mobilization beforehand. Otherwise, it is not enough to be regarded as a sign of using force against Russia. Therefore, although the possibility of a Japanese-Russian war is stronger than that of a Japanese-American war, the timing of its outbreak still needs to be awaited, without any doubt.</p>
<p>What we worry about is not the deterioration of the confrontational situation between Japan and Russia today, but in 1936. Recently, in mid-December of this year, Japan's "Diplomatic Review" published an article by Yoshimura Chūzō entitled "Japanese-Soviet Opposition and Cooperation." Its conclusions were: (1) Soviet border defense forces, both land and air, must withdraw to west of Lake Baikal. (2) Japanese people should be free to enter the Soviet Union without interference from the public security teams. (3) Japanese people must have absolute freedom to enter and exit Outer Mongolia. The area should not be sealed off by the Soviets. (4) Immediately resolve the China Eastern Railway and North Pacific fisheries issues. (5) Combine Japan, "Manchukuo," "Outer Mongolia," and "Xinjiang" into a defensive alliance, and then agree to consult with the Soviet Union on a permanent peace plan. The "Diplomatic Review" has close ties with the Japanese military, and its tone is often the same as the military. This has been evident in the events of the past three or four years. Now, looking at the key points raised by Yoshimura, his ambition to realize the continental policy is evident on paper. A split with Russia is inevitable. At the same time, can the people of our country not be vigilant when they see Yoshimura's argument?</p>

<p>(Nanchang) A telegram from Ningdu on the 24th reported that according to the reporter for Deputy Commander-in-Chief Luo Zhuoying, the Third Route Army, from the beginning of the fifth encirclement and suppression in October of last year until the recovery of Ningdu in October of this year, went through more than 30 battles. The number of officers and soldiers who died in battle was more than 3,000. The number of wounded was about 7,000. The suffering of the masses is not included. The significance of this memorial service is indeed significant. No matter how cunning the Kiangsi bandits are, as long as we can work hard, victory will ultimately belong to us. The 120-li Guangning Highway was completed in just over 20 days. The Guangrui Highway is also currently being planned. Once the planning is completed, construction will begin to facilitate domestic people to go for inspection. (Central Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>US President Roosevelt issued a Christmas broadcast to the people of the United States today at the fireplace of the White House, encouraging courage and unity, and said that the American people will have new hope in the coming year. The President also pressed a button, and the lights on Christmas trees all over the country lit up. (Reuters, 24th) (Washington) President Roosevelt extended his Christmas greetings to the nation today, saying he hoped that courage and unity would be the spirit of Christmas. The President also said that this view would lead to greater happiness. What was only seen as hope a year ago has mostly been realized this year, and new hopes have arisen this year. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(New York) This Christmas is regarded by the entire United States as one of the happiest since 1929, because it is believed that the depression has come to an end, and it is just the right time to have fun and celebrate together. The total number of toys, food, and chocolate candies sold in the city exceeded that of 1933 by 20% to 30%. People from other states traveled to Florida and Atlanta in the South for suburban tours. The city hall here gave Christmas gifts to 200,000 poor families. In addition, as usual, relief supplies were distributed, including 300,000 bags of coal and 614,000 boxes of stewed beef. The legal sale of alcohol in the city has also increased the happiness of citizens. President Roosevelt and his wife celebrated Christmas at home and made a Christmas tree by hand. Today, the Christmas tree in Lafayette Park will be lit by the President himself. Even the birds and squirrels in the park will be given peanuts. (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>France Last night was Christmas Eve. The weather was warm and not rainy, which was very pleasant. There were many religious believers who participated in midnight Mass. Afterwards, they held a vigil all night. Thousands of homeless people were fortunate to be rescued by the Salvation Army and were able to participate in the festivities. The restaurants were full of diners, and prices were lower than last year. For example, the price of a meal in a top restaurant was only 130 francs. (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>

A large number of toys were donated for a time, and all were distributed at the Paris Exhibition Center. The venue was equipped with various children's games, and in the center was a huge Christmas tree, which was covered with toys of all kinds. From this morning, thousands of children have successively entered the venue to receive toys, and there has been a thunderous sound of joy. Within three days, 10,000 children of unemployed people will enter the venue to receive toys. Premier Flandin will personally distribute the toys this afternoon.

If someone has the madness of suicide and loves war more than peace, then we must also pray to God to drive away these warmongers.

<p>Czechoslovakia Foreign Minister Beneš published an article in the Prague newspaper today entitled "The Political View of Christmas 1934," saying that the forces of peace in Europe have now been reunited, which is the most important fact of 1934. According to Beneš, the future evolution of the European political situation is somewhat optimistic, and there is hope for improvement in both the political and economic situation. Currently, the countries of the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente rely on France in the West and the Soviet Union in the East, and are gradually becoming important factors in consolidating European peace. This large group is currently being organized. Its purpose is not to be hostile to any country, but to seek the approval of Poland and Germany for its policies and methods, and to seek a basis for cooperation with Italy in Central Europe. Regarding the issue of European peace, Beneš said, "We have not completely left danger, but in recent months, various trends have been uniting the forces of peace and organizing them reasonably. We can therefore hope that the dangerous time in the evolution of the European political situation has passed, and the danger of war, although it once filled the sky, has now clearly diminished. However, we must still pay attention to the development of various events, and the forces of peace must be encouraged to concentrate and achieve success." (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>

The troops of different countries have different beliefs, and their priests hold religious ceremonies in their own languages. The Chairman of the Saar Administrative Commission, Knox, is currently inspecting the locations where the troops are stationed with General Plunkett, the commander of the international forces. Preparations for the plebiscite are actively underway. The lists of voters in each district have been created with great care, and can be said to have reached 99% accuracy. Any errors are mostly due to inaccurate or missing reference documents, but even so, the errors are very few.

<p>(London) "The Times" today published figures in its discussion of the recent British House of Commons' handling of the issue of Chinese railway loans, showing that the recent income of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has increased significantly, which is a clear sign of progress. However, it said that other aspects must also be considered to be fair. In the past three months, the Chinese government has remitted 600,000 pounds sterling to repay the Crisp loan and the British-French loan. This is sufficient evidence that the Chinese government, despite facing various financial and political difficulties, is still trying to restore its foreign credit. What is gratifying is that the British-French loan has been paid in full, and efforts are being made to deal with the Crisp loan, so those who hold the Hukuang Railway bonds can hope to receive more favorable treatment in the near future.

Hamada took the stage to deliver his inaugural speech. Then, former Speaker Akita took the stage to deliver his resignation speech. The oldest member of the Diet, Takagi Heikichi, expressed his gratitude.

The House of Representatives was established, and the House of Peers and the government were notified immediately. The meeting adjourned at 12:48. (Japan United Press, 25th) (Tokyo) The Seiyukai felt the necessity of cooperation between the political and Minseito parties. Therefore, when electing the standing committee chairman on the 27th, if the Minseito Party had any hope, it planned to cede the two chairmanship positions for resolutions and suggestions to the Minseito Party to give a few examples of cooperation in the Diet first. However, the union failed to materialize during the election of the speaker on the 24th and cooperation failed to materialize. Its momentum is attracting attention. The Seiyukai executives have not given up cooperating. Although the Minseito executives have the same opinion, expectations for the alliance have sharply decreased since Dongwu's bomb motion. The Minseito Party claims every time it meets that cooperation has been broken. Even regarding the issue of the committee chairman, the Seiyukai Party is willing to concede without refusing, but it does not force it. Therefore, unless the Seiyukai Party eases its tough stance towards the government, it will be difficult to see any cooperation realized. (Dentsu Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations will take full effect on February 27 of next year. The Foreign Ministry is discussing countermeasures. Because Japan was originally a member of the League of Nations and held the position of permanent director, its withdrawal is more significant than that of Germany and Brazil. Therefore, a cautious attitude is adopted. The Foreign Ministry's views on various issues after the withdrawal takes effect are as follows: (1) The South Pacific mandated territories will not be changed due to withdrawal, because they were not mandated by the League of Nations, but by the Allied Powers. (2) Continue to cooperate with the International Labor Organization and the International Court of Justice. (3) Continue to cooperate on disarmament matters. (Dentsu Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>Regarding how the United Kingdom and the United States should jointly act to deal with Japan if it engages in building a navy or using other methods to expand its navy, making it impossible for treaties to restrain it, naval authorities from the two countries have been in discussions for five weeks. The naval departments of both countries have considered building cruisers by the United Kingdom and building giant battleships by the United States, according to their respective needs. This shipbuilding plan of the United Kingdom and the United States is contingent upon Japan building new ships, and the total tonnage built will be determined to maintain the 5:5:3 ratio among the navies of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. In addition, the naval authorities of the United Kingdom and the United States have decided that the maximum tonnage exceeding the limits of the Washington Naval Treaty for new ships built by both countries will be temporarily set at 120,000 tons. The above measures have been considered by the naval authorities of both countries. However, President Roosevelt recently decided to temporarily suspend these talks, believing that it would be better to wait until next spring. It is because Secretary of State Hull of the United States presented a plan for international supervision of arms manufacturing and trade in November of this year, which will be discussed in Geneva next spring. Depending on the outcome of the discussion, a universal agreement on arms supervision may be reached within the scope of the Disarmament Conference. If so, the atmosphere should improve by next spring. President Roosevelt also advocated that naval talks after the abolition of the Washington Treaty should include France, Italy, and Germany. The participation of these countries in naval talks is very important, and the internal situation in Germany is expected to improve after this winter. Therefore, it will be easier for Germany to participate in international negotiations next spring. As for the United Kingdom, it also agrees to Germany participating in naval talks. Well-informed sources here even say that inviting France, Italy, and Germany to participate in the naval talks next spring was proposed by the United Kingdom. As for Japan's participation in this talk, it must be subject to conditions, that is, abandoning the principle of equality in numbers and tonnage, recognizing the new naval ratio system, or at least recognizing the principle of equality based on security.

<p>(Rome) Regarding the conflict between the troops of Italian Somaliland and the escort team of the British commission in early December, Italy still believes that Abyssinia should bear full responsibility. The Italian government today sent a note to the League of Nations, stating that Italy will only agree to negotiate with Abyssinia to resolve the dispute after Abyssinia provides full compensation. The Italian government denies Abyssinia's claim that the case was provoked by Italian soldiers in Somaliland, saying that such disputes are not isolated incidents. In fact, on that day, Abyssinian soldiers launched a surprise attack on the Italian army outpost in Walwal without warning or provocation. A few days before the incident, the Ethiopian commander had requested the right to send troops to Walwal, which was formally rejected by the Italian authorities. Therefore, they took advantage of their superior military strength to launch a sudden attack. Since the treaty was signed in 1908, the Italian government has always been willing to demarcate the border. Work began in 1910, but was suspended due to Ethiopian obstruction. However, Italy is still willing to resume the above work. However, the Abyssinian government has violated the treaties signed with Italy and the League of Nations Covenant, and arbitrarily invaded Walwal. The Italian government will only be able to proceed after obtaining satisfaction. (Reuters, 25th)</p>

<p>Said to Have No Military Nature</p>
<p>250,000 Young People Join Factory Work</p>
<p>Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Other Countries Send Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>National Socialist Berlin Correspondence Berlin Labor Service Propaganda Office Publication Department recently received an instruction from the Police Commander Müller Brandenburg issued by the Presidential Palace Secretariat. The main points of the original text are extracted as follows:</p>
<p>The German labor service has attracted great attention from various countries. The reasons are too numerous to mention and vary from country to country. Recently, youth societies and university student unions in Britain, the United States, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, and even Denmark and Norway, are particularly interested in studying this issue. This is an inevitable consensus. This labor service of great value in Germany is now being implemented step by step throughout the country, with well-organized plans. The results have significant national economic value and are truly beneficial to the people. Therefore, because this plan is closely related to the general national economy, it has attracted the attention of most people in North, Central, and South America. Subsequently, people in Britain, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden have also paid attention to it, and Japan has specialized personnel to study it. However, France has a different interest in this cause. French political figures believe that the cause itself has great significance and is closely related to the general national economic interests, and their interest in research is particularly strong, believing that Germany is carrying out a large-scale labor service to resist powerful countries. Therefore, French political figures have declared that the German labor service is a disguised form of expanding armaments. In fact, there is no labor service that is purely for manufacturing military supplies. Fortunately, the various attacks from France have not been believed. Furthermore, many young people from Britain and the United States have personally visited Germany to investigate and have worked in factories and workers' dormitories, just like the Germans. This proves the truth. Moreover, these young people from Britain and the United States are not in the same factory, that is, any factory in Germany has been thoroughly investigated. Not only these young people from Britain and the United States have conducted investigations, but Denmark and Sweden have also sent special personnel to investigate German labor service, staying in various factories in Germany for several weeks or even a month.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Germany Sincere About Peace <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Propaganda Minister Goebbels said in a speech to the industrial sector today that Germany not only speaks of peace, but is also prepared to prove its desire for peace through actions. Germany does not want to plunge the world into war and turmoil, but only wants to restore its inherent peace and honor. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Those who have been there for a long time have made practical investigations. They all frankly stated that the German labor service has no military nature. But what is our labor service? In short, the so-called labor service is the creation of German youth. These young people deeply know the contradictions of the government controlled by Marx's international democratic Jews from 1918 to 1932, and therefore are dissatisfied with it and rebel against it. At that time, it was divided into many parties, each party consolidated its power, and each party established its own political claims. At that time, all parties knew the need to engage in labor service, so everyone worked hard. Why? In short, in fact, each party wanted to avoid unemployment. Under this situation, no one would not work hard, especially workers, university students, craftsmen, and young people. Then, the reason why the parties worked so hard was certainly to avoid the unfortunate problem of unemployment, but also to consolidate the power of their parties, so they used the strength of their lives to build the vitality of their parties. At that time, the whole country, regardless of old or young, although these old and young people were not needed for work, their thoughts were also permeated by the spirit of labor, and everyone hoped to achieve the greatest labor price. Therefore, the concept of labor became popular around the world, so the foundation of all labor habits and labor spirit was laid here. In the second and third years, the National Socialist Party and the Stahlhelm League devoted themselves to the labor service movement, because we deeply know that this kind of movement has the value of national economy and etiquette, so its movement became increasingly larger and its power increased. We use labor service to avoid various stubborn high pressures. Since 1932, in recent years, the German labor service movement has been expanding very rapidly. In total, 250,000 young people have joined factories to work. It is a pity that these young people are ignorant and affected by various parties, willing to be tools of various parties. Naturally, these young people have no systematic plan and fall into reckless actions. Even the actions prohibited by France are willing to commit, so it gets worse and worse, acts recklessly, and does not know what to do. As a result, nothing is achieved. Later, due to the sudden rise of the National Socialist revolution, it was the time to create a happy future for labor service. Since this revolution, in March last year, under the leadership of the current Republican Prime Minister Hitler, we have worked hard to improve the labor service movement, using a reasonable new method to revitalize it. Hitler and Labor Minister Schellert and representatives planned good strategies and appointed Heer as the Secretary General of the Labor Service Movement to lead this movement. After Heer was ordered, he formed the "Republic Labor Service Guidance Office" and implemented it in order, with remarkable results. The previous unorganized and uncertain thoughts were completely cleared, and everything was orderly and systematic, focusing the viewpoints of all people to promote it together. Labor service now has no other political parties. Under the leadership of the National Socialist Party, German labor service is working hard to promote it. The comrades of the Stahlhelm League have also fully accepted the plans of the National Socialist Party and are working hard together. At present, there are already 250,000 young male workers distributed in 1,500 factories to work, working together to implement Heer's guiding plan and complete the tasks of the National Socialist Party. In the future, all university students should also have a period of time to hold hoes and serve in this cause, "as a necessary qualification for future officialdom." Everyone should take responsibility, from father to son, generation after generation, and do their best to serve Germany.</p>
<p>In this way, the danger of class war can be transcended. The educational purpose of the Republic must be to give each student a few weeks to do practical social service, awaken the patriotic concept and social sense of the country's youth, be able to pay attention to the major events of the country's past, and recognize the current needs of the country. "Our labor service plan only works six hours a day per person, but what should be done is difficult to say in one word. Here are the main points: Generally speaking, the fundamental principle is that we have participated in labor service, and we should never engage in free enterprises. If we let them be free enterprises, their value will be high, and they will inevitably not be able to jointly be responsible for completing public works. Our labor service first manages the natural endowments of our country and improves the land of our country. Its meaning is to first improve the useful land of the people in various places in Germany. Currently, if we can divert water to irrigate one-third of the land in the country, the results can be said to be good. Secondly, we will engage in the transformation of domestic forests, and then implement large-scale farmer relocation, distributing farmers in various places, and cultivating the fields of major cities. The labor service project is very large and the affairs are very complicated. We must gather the strength of the public and start from practice, otherwise the national wealth will not be able to be developed and all undertakings will be at a loss. We must know that if the labor service can proceed smoothly, then we will be able to enjoy endlessly in the future and there will be no more sigh of no production. Labor service is the vanguard of Hitler's National Socialist Party policy. Hitler has clearly defined the plan to develop the national economy and hopes that we will all work hard to implement it.</p>

<p>Relieving Poverty and Helping the Distressed | Sincere Unity</p>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler's confidant Hess broadcast a speech today, broadcasting to German expatriates overseas, detailing Hitler's achievements in the past two years, as well as relieving poverty and helping the distressed. Hess also said that the unity of all parties in Germany today can be called unique in the world. The German people have the right to be proud of belonging to a nation that has restored its best qualities. The greatness of Hitler's achievements cannot be compared to the victory of weapons. Hitler painstakingly maintained peace in Europe last year, and today the whole world and politicians of various countries know to thank him. (Reuters, 24th) (Berlin) Defense Minister General Blomberg recently gave an interview to a reporter from the United Press of America, saying, "Since the purge on June 30, the military training of stormtroopers has never stopped. This is out of Hitler's firm will and also advocated by the Chief of Staff of the Stormtroopers, Lutz. Although the strength of the German Wehrmacht is enough to be proud of, I still advocate implementing a compulsory conscription system, because if Germany wants to engage in war and conquer the four directions, an experienced professional army is more applicable than conscripts who have only received short-term training. However, it should be known that the army is the best school for citizens. The reason why we advocate the conscription system is that we want the German people to be trained in this school. Although Germany has not yet implemented the conscription system, the stormtroopers, security guards, and volunteer work teams are actually no different from schools. After joining these organizations, people can develop the habits of obedience, discipline, and friendship, so as to form the strength of the main force storage to supplement the shortcomings of the army. However, the personnel belonging to the various institutions of the stormtroopers must still be trained in the army before they can become soldiers." General Blomberg then denied the rumors that he and Hitler were not on good terms, saying that he was a technician and did not want to interfere in politics. When the reporter from the Associated Press asked about the German military buildup, he declined to answer. When talking about the smuggling of foreign aircraft into the country, he said that there was no so-called smuggling. In fact, it was just importing some aircraft as samples for creating war potential. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to news published in "Le Journal," recently, because of "rectifying discipline," a large number of people were arrested in various countries. The first batch was arrested in the town of Klein Luckenau in the German province of Silesia, a total of more than 50 people. "L'Echo de Paris" also reprinted news from the Czech "World Magazine," saying that the tragedy of June 30 (referring to the event in which Hitler shot more than 100 stormtroopers and other personnel) is now being repeated. Since June 30, 230 people have been executed one after another. It started in the town of Bruckenau in the province of Silesia. Some old fighters of the National Socialist Party and 3,000 members of the security group have been disarmed. The newspaper concluded that this kind of arrest and killing will greatly hinder the plebiscite in the Saar region. Now, the vote in the Saar region is only 19 days away, but these actions cannot be avoided or delayed, so the urgency of the situation in Germany can be known. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<p>Yi Wo and Chaisan Came to Tianjin to Discuss</p>
<p>Must Wait for Meeting to Resolve</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication, Yi Wo, Chief of the Japanese Military Affairs Office in Shanhaiguan, came to Tianjin from Beiping on the 20th and met with Meijiro Umezu, commander of the Japanese army in Tianjin, to exchange views on the rotation of our newly compiled war zone special police force to the east. At noon on the 21st, Kenjiro Chaisan also rushed over from Beiping and visited Umezu with Yi Wo to discuss the matter. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, Chaisan, accompanied by Tanaka, deputy consul of the Japanese consulate in Tianjin, went to the provincial government to visit Gan Xuezhong to discuss this issue. It has been generally decided that the only difference is that the Japanese side wants the date for the eastern rotation of our newly compiled special police force to be implemented without further discussion, and the number of personnel must comply with the regulations of 6,000. Each company of light machine guns is only allowed to carry four. The location of their garrison must also not differ from the area where the current security team is stationed. Before entering the war zone, representatives of the Kwantung Army and the North China Garrison Army must send personnel to check to avoid exceeding the agreed number of personnel and carrying too many light machine guns. The provincial government believes that reducing the number of light machine guns is tantamount to reducing the strength of the team. Bandits in various parts of the war zone are rising up, and without more powerful firearms, how can they be suppressed? Therefore, they do not quite agree. Chaisan returned to Beiping on the afternoon of the 22nd, and Yi Wo went to Beiping again on the 23rd. He will invite members of our war zone cleaning committee Zhu Shiqin, Yin Rugeng, Yin Tong, and Xu Shen to hold a meeting in Beiping on the 26th and 27th to discuss and decide. According to this observation, the eastern opening of the new special warfare team may only be realized after the new year.</p>
<p>Regarding the handover of Malanyu Eastern Tombs, Yi Wo, who came to Tianjin, said that he had met with Yin Rugeng many times and that the handover was not a problem. It can be realized soon. The order of handover in the future is to hand over Malanyu first and then the Eastern Tombs. This time, Yi Wo will go to Beiping again to discuss this matter with Yin Rugeng in addition to discussing the rotation of the special police team into the war zone.</p>
<p>Regarding the problem of reorganizing the Yutian war zone security supplementary team, the Japanese side hopes that we will increase the number of personnel to 2,000 according to the organizational structure of Liu Ren's regiment and Zhao Lei's department of the war zone security first and second brigades, and transfer them out of Yutian so that the people can rest and county administration can be promoted. Their new defense area is Qinhuangdao. Zhu Shiqin went to Yutian a few days ago to contact the leaders of the team, and there were no objections. However, the method has not yet been realized. On the 21st of this month, the team suddenly clashed again with the Wang Jizong department of the militia in Yagongqiao Town, firing guns all night. The residents were panicked, and many people fled to other counties one after another and were looted and shot by the team on the way. The Cleaning Committee then sent Zhu Shiqin to mediate again. Zhu arrived in Yutian on the 22nd and is currently mediating. Chairman Yu Xuezhong of Hebei Province believes that the security team is undisciplined and wreaks havoc on the area, and regardless of where they are transferred, they cannot be peaceful, so he is still considering the matter of going to Qinhuangdao.

Director Peng, representing President Wang, said, "This time, I was ordered to participate in the memorial service specifically.

<h3 id="e108">Qing Dynasty Royal Treasure: Dragon Eye Pearl Also for Sale <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Said to Have the Effect of Prolonging Life</p>
<p>Buyer Also an American Merchant</p>
<p>(North Beiping Correspondence) Since the fall of the Manchu Qing dynasty, treasures from the palace have been disappearing one after another. After Puyi's sister-in-law, Pu Tang Shixia, secretly sold the Dust-Repelling Pearl to an American merchant, a person familiar with the Qing court recently revealed that the Qing Palace also possessed a Fire-Repelling Pearl and a Dragon Eye Pearl, each one, which have also been sold to an American. According to reports, "On the throne in the Qianqing Palace of the Qing Dynasty, there was a dragon head frame, with the Fire-Repelling Pearl embedded in its left eye and the Dust-Repelling Pearl in its right eye. The Fire-Repelling Pearl was lost during the Tongzhi and Guangxu eras. It is said that the Fire-Repelling Pearl was about the same size as the Dust-Repelling Pearl, with a black color and dazzling brilliance. If the pearl was placed in a tray, any candle lit within a foot of the pearl would extinguish without wind. As for the Dust-Repelling Pearl, it was removed by Puyi when he left the palace and placed on a table in the main hall. During the night, even with strong winds, the area within a foot of the pearl remained dust-free by the next morning. It was truly a supreme treasure."</p>
<p>It was also said that during the early Qing dynasty, when Vietnam paid tribute, they offered a Pearl of Longevity, also known as the Dragon Eye Pearl. The pearl was yellow with a black spot in the middle, resembling a dragon's eye, hence the name. It weighed about 1.8 qian (approx. 6.7 grams). In the early Qing dynasty, when Prince Regent Dorgon was in power, the Qing court bestowed this pearl as a reward. After Dorgon's death, his descendants regarded it as a family heirloom, storing it in a brocade pouch and wearing it on their navel, remaining free from illness throughout the year, indeed having the effect of prolonging life. Therefore, several generations of the Prince Rui lived to be eighty, ninety, or even a hundred years old. The pearl was warm in winter and cool in summer. Besides increasing lifespan, it was also rumored to have the ability to ward off weapons, fire, and water, which is quite absurd and not to be believed. The descendants of Prince Rui, after 1919 and 1920, experienced a decline in their family fortunes and decided to sell the pearl. After appraisal by Belgian and French jewelers, it was valued at 120,000 (currency not specified). The descendants of Prince Rui believed the pearl to be priceless and did not immediately sell it. Later, they used it as collateral to borrow 50,000 yuan from an American bank in Tianjin for a five-year term. A few years ago, they tried to sell it again, but the deal fell through due to a large difference in the price. It is now heard that the mortgage term for this pearl has expired, and those aware of the matter say that the descendants of the Prince, unable to redeem it, have sold it to the American bank for a price of 80,000 (currency not specified). It has now been shipped to the United States. The outflow of national treasures is truly regrettable. (23rd)</p>

<p>Resignation of the Head of Shatou Town</p>
<p>The administrative region of Taicang County is currently divided into six districts. Shatou Town, which is under the county's jurisdiction, is the fifth district. The town head is enthusiastic in his work, but his straightforward nature inevitably makes him a target of jealousy. Recently, a certain newspaper in the county has used the town head as a target for attack. The town head, provoked by this, has become extremely passive in his attitude. He has previously resigned several times without success. This time, he may suddenly retire. However, there are many vying for the position of town head, and it remains to be seen who will ultimately succeed.</p>

<p>Main Culprit in Bribery and Release of Drug Dealer Arrested</p>
<p>Wu Liansheng (also known as Lian Suozi), an inspector from the Jiangyin County Drug Investigation Office, on July 11th of last year, apprehended Pan Renmei, who was using red pills, at the home of Lian Jisheng at No. 1 Huaishu Lane in Wuxi city. He extorted a large sum of money. Around October, Wu fled to Jiangyin and, together with Wu Bingjun, the former head of the Second Public Security Bureau of the county, seized red pills at the home of Chen Jinhe in Xiaoqingyang. They accepted a bribe of over 1,000 yuan to settle the matter privately. When the case was exposed, Wu and others fled without a trace. Both Wuxi and Jiangyin counties issued arrest warrants. Recently, Wu Liansheng, believing the situation had calmed down, secretly returned home and hid next to the Housheng Silk Factory in Nancangmen. Wu Rongquan, nicknamed "Zhonggangpen," discovered this and immediately instructed his friend Qian Shiliang to report it to the Second Public Security Bureau in charge. Director Gao of the bureau, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched police chief Guan Shihao to arrest Wu Liansheng and brought him to the bureau for detention before transferring him to the General Bureau. Yesterday, he was transferred to the local branch court for interrogation. After the prosecutor, Ren, held a court hearing, he immediately ordered him to be detained pending judgment. At the same time, the Jiangyin County Party Headquarters, upon learning that Wu Liansheng, the fugitive who bribed and released Chen Jinhe, had been arrested, sent an official letter to the Jiangyin County Government, which was then forwarded to the local court, proposing to bring the suspect to Jiangyin for interrogation and trial.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Fires Occur One After Another <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Fires have been occurring frequently in both urban and rural areas this month. The cause is mostly due to carelessness with fire. Yesterday alone, three fires occurred, resulting in significant losses. The details are as follows: (1) Zhou Qiantai Hat and Shoe Store, located at the northern end of Datie Bridge in the city, is owned by Zhou Weiquan from Wangting and also sells Weixu incense, embroidery, and other items. The business was doing quite well. Yesterday (25th) morning around 2:00 AM, a fire suddenly broke out on the second floor due to carelessness, with flames shooting out and breaking through the roof. The owner, Zhou Weiquan, and others, who lived on the third floor, jumped out of the windows and fled to the roof of the neighboring Meixin Incense and Powder Shop before managing to escape safely. As the fire intensified, and with the narrow streets, the windows of the Maolun Xiecheng Yong silk shops across the street were also affected. Fortunately, they used their own water pumps and exerted their efforts to extinguish the fire, thus preserving them, with only slight losses. Fire engines from Sections 1, 2, and 3 of the Central District also arrived at the scene upon hearing the alarm to extinguish the fire. As a result, Zhou Qiantai was mostly burned down, and although Meixin was not completely affected, the goods were water damaged. The combined losses for both families are estimated at three to four thousand yuan. (2) Two thatched huts in the rice fields near the Dade Bridge on Wuli Street outside the West Gate also caught fire last night due to carelessness. The Huishan and other fire brigades arrived at the scene to extinguish the fire. The two thatched huts were completely destroyed. Chen Heshang, a member of the Section 3 fire brigade in the Northern District, was injured in his right instep and buttocks by a fire engine while rushing to put out the fire. He was immediately sent to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. (3) A grass shed opposite the Yongtai Silk Factory outside the South Gate was also burned down last night, with only minor losses.</p>

<p>Scheduled Damming of the Wujin Section of the Canal</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government is dredging the canal between Zhenjiang and Wujin as a form of work relief. The Wujin County Chamber of Commerce, based on letters from various trade associations, requested that the damming of the Wujin section of the canal be postponed, as the end of the year is approaching, and business relies heavily on water transport. The Chamber of Commerce immediately wrote to Chen Ziding, the director of the engineering office, requesting a postponement. Yesterday (24th), they received a reply stating that according to the original plan, all sections would be dammed simultaneously, and the area around Benniu in Wujin should have already been implemented. Considering the impact on business transport, it has already been postponed repeatedly. To take into account the difficulties of businesses, they are requested to notify all trades to complete the transfer of goods by the end of this month, under the premise of not hindering the dam construction, and the damming will begin at the beginning of next month, etc.</p>

<p>Xiang Zhizhuang, the head of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Department and standing committee member of the Provincial Anti-Smoking Association, arrived in Changzhou today (25th) from Wuxi, accompanied by training supervisor Bai Zhujun and others, to inspect the security force and inspect the County Anti-Smoking Committee. County Magistrate Hou, upon hearing the news, had already gathered the security force in advance for an immediate assembly and inspection.</p>

<p>Prohibition of Villagers from Gathering to Stop Vehicles</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department believes that the long-distance bus company's vehicles are primarily intended to facilitate public transportation. Although it is a business venture, it is also beneficial to the public. In principle, the company and the public should have a mutual relationship of mutual benefit and reliance, and there should be no cause for hostility. However, there are often one or two cunning individuals who harbor personal grievances and either let livestock loose, damage trees, or allow their children to damage bridges, hindering traffic. Once the company intervenes, or the vehicles accidentally collide with livestock, they use this as an excuse to incite ignorant people to stop the vehicles. If someone is unfortunately injured in a collision, it becomes even more difficult to reason with them. To eliminate danger, a special request has been submitted to the province to instruct all counties to announce to the villagers that if long-distance buses have any unfortunate accidents, they can file a complaint with the government for a resolution in accordance with the law. They are not allowed to gather and stop vehicles, causing trouble.</p>

<p>Suspicious Bandit Boat Discovered in Xianzhen</p>
<p>The home of Chen Jingan, a farmer in Renjia Bridge, Guihua Township, Second District of the county, was robbed of leather clothing and other items by bandits on the night of the 29th of last month. A report was filed with the county bureau for investigation. The anti-crime squad leader, Zhang Qingan, led police to Xianzhen the night before and discovered a small boat with suspicious movements. The boat dweller, Qiu Youde, and the five suspicious individuals, Xu Mingren, Shen Linan, Shen Rongzhu, and Shen Rongli, were all taken to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. It is rumored to be related to the Chen robbery case.</p>

<p>Liyang County suffered the most severe drought in the Jiangnan region this summer. Disaster victims were everywhere, and the commercial market plummeted. Shops were desolate, barely surviving, and still struggling to stay afloat. Unexpectedly, Zhou Yulin, the head of the Business Tax Bureau, disregarded the hardships faced by businesses. The stores were unable to pay the business taxes for the autumn and winter seasons in time. The bureau head believed that the merchants were intentionally resisting taxes. Without prior consultation, he suddenly dispatched police to the Tiancheng, Tianxiang, Derun, and other stores on Ximen Avenue at 11:00 AM yesterday (23rd), ordering them to close down and posting prepared notices at any time. He also sent the managers of these stores to the County Government for detention. As a result, all trade associations of the city's stores convened an emergency meeting, unanimously stating that this year's rare drought made it impossible for merchants to raise tax funds in time, not that they intentionally resisted taxes. The bureau head's actions were considered too erratic, and at 1:00 PM, all the stores went on strike. The County Chamber of Commerce immediately held a meeting, deciding to first telegraph the situation to the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments. This morning (24th), the various trade associations and the County Chamber of Commerce held another meeting, with County Magistrate Chen also attending, explaining the misunderstanding and hoping that the stores would resume business at any time. Representatives of the merchants and the standing committee of the Chamber of Commerce requested that the province send someone to Liyang to collect taxes and that the bureau head, Zhou Yulin, be dismissed. County Magistrate Chen did not give a specific answer, and the meeting ended without a resolution.</p>

<p>According to a report submitted by the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, the Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters investigated Yu Mozhai, a manufacturer of red pills. The suspect was from Yiwu and had been manufacturing red pills in his hometown, selling them in neighboring Dongyang and other counties. The anti-smoking committee had previously issued an order for the county to assist in the arrest. Unexpectedly, the suspect hid in Hangzhou City, using the alias Tang Youshan, and rented a house at No. 20 Sanguan Lane, continuing his old business. He was discovered by Wu Wangji, a member of the anti-smoking committee, who handed him over to the police. Evidence of red pill manufacturing was found at No. 23 Sanguan Lane. The tenant of the house confirmed the facts. He was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad at the first dock in Jianggan at 9:00 AM yesterday (25th).</p>

<p>Disaster Victims Form Begging Group</p>
<p>The third district of Xiaoshan is located in Cexiang. The drought this summer was particularly severe. Although the province and county distributed buckwheat seeds, financial resources were exhausted, and people were unable to make a living. They could not even afford meals and mostly subsisted on bran, turnips, green weeds, and wild fruits. The strong have already considered desperate measures, while the weak have pawned everything, even selling their daughters and children, and some have even committed suicide. The situation is so dire that it brings tears to one's eyes. If assistance is not provided urgently, it may lead to disaster. It is heard that the province has allocated 170,000 (currency not specified) for work relief, which has been used for dredging the Nansha Canal, but it has not reached the southern region. Gentry in the city have jointly appealed to the provincial and county governments for relief. It is now heard that the disaster victims in the district have formed a begging group, and have been kneeling to government authorities to plead for assistance.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency) The municipal commemoration of the 19th anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising was held at 10:00 AM yesterday in the auditorium of the Municipal Party Headquarters. Xing Wan, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, presided over the meeting, reporting on the significance of the commemoration. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Assembly Order <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>

<h3 id="e123">Chairman's Report <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>After the formalities, Chairman Xing Wan delivered a report, stating that the Yunnan Uprising occurred because Yuan Shikai disregarded public opinion, acted arbitrarily, and declared himself emperor. Therefore, Mr. Cai Songpo, Mr. Tang Jiyao, and others launched the uprising in Yunnan and raised troops to punish Yuan. Various provinces responded. Yuan's betrayal of the Republic of China had been brewing for a long time. After the Xinhai Revolution, the General left the post of President and relinquished it to Yuan Shikai because many comrades in the Party misunderstood the success of the revolution, believing that the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China meant the success of the revolution. The General reorganized the Kuomintang into the Chinese Revolutionary Party to make the comrades aware that the revolutionary work of our party had not yet ended and still needed effort. The General once wrote to comrades in Nanyang, overseas branches, and Mr. Deng Zeru, stating that comrades should obey the party leader and strive for revolution. Unexpectedly, Yuan Shikai abandoned the provisional constitution, dissolved the parliament, and declared himself emperor. The General said that all internal wars in Chinese history had started with the declaration of an emperor. Today, our revolution aims to separate power and ability, with power belonging to the people and ability belonging to the government. The government is an omnipotent government, and the people are empowered people. The General has explained this in detail in the chapter on the Principle of Democracy. However, the foundation of democracy lies in the successful implementation of local autonomy. We can conclude that the success of the revolution requires (1) comrades to absolutely obey the party leader; (2) to absolutely obey the revolutionary strategy of the Three Principles of the People; and (3) to establish an omnipotent government.</p>

<p>Zhang Xiaoliang Also Donates Several Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>The Urgent Relief General Donation Association has been receiving donations from major and minor schools in the city. Yesterday, the association received the following donations: Xinmin Middle School: 8 yuan in large currency, 2.08 yuan in small currency; Yu Dun Primary School: 4 yuan in large currency; Haoqiao Primary School: 1 yuan in large currency, 0.17 yuan in small currency; Anguo Primary School: 1 yuan in large currency; Shenjiang Primary School: 7.7 yuan in large currency, 0.72 yuan in small currency, and 438 copper coins.</p>

It is heard that Jiongde Hall donated 10,000 yuan yesterday, sending representatives to the association to count the money. Mr. Zhang Xiaoliang also sent a letter to the association, donating several thousand yuan, showing that the wealthy are deeply sympathetic to the disaster areas and are enthusiastically donating.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Ministry of Finance Considering Rewarding Silver Imports <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Banks May Bring Silver Back to Shanghai</p>
<p>(Shen Shi News Agency) It is said that the banking industry in Shanghai has suggested that the Ministry of Finance reward silver imports. A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency learned from the banking industry yesterday that regarding the issue of rewarding silver imports, foreign businesses must request the government to refund the silver tax and equalization tax paid when the silver was previously exported, or to exempt the returned silver from export tax and equalization tax in the future. Only then would they be willing to bring silver back. This matter is related to the credibility of our government, and the Ministry of Finance is carefully considering whether to easily approve it. However, it is certain that leaders of the local banking industry and financial authorities have been discussing a proper solution for days. As for the rumor yesterday that HSBC Bank had remitted 20 million yuan from Hong Kong, this rumor has not been confirmed. Because the equalization tax and silver tax issues have not been resolved, it is not easy to bring back large amounts of silver. However, it is generally believed that it is indeed possible for HSBC Bank to bring back silver within a certain period. About two months ago, no less than 70 million yuan was transferred from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Previously, the cash crunch in Shantou and other places was severe, and HSBC issued more banknotes in South China. Therefore, to enhance its reserves, it had to collect a large amount of cash in Hong Kong to secure its credit. Now that the cash crunch has passed, it is indeed possible to transfer some of the cash in Hong Kong back to Shanghai.</p>

<p>The International Trade Bureau announced that a certain merchant wishes to purchase dull tin powder, lead powder, or lead-tin alloy powder. Our country has no shortage of experts in physics and chemistry, so it should not be difficult to use physical or chemical methods to produce a lead-tin powder that does not change its original luster or its ductility.

<p>The International Trade Bureau recently received a report from the Consulate in Penang, stating that the Straits Settlements government gazetted the import quota restrictions for foreign cotton textiles in 1935. The restriction quota for our country next year is 12,190,559 yards: 800,051 yards of bleached cotton cloth, 10,145,075 yards of dyed cotton cloth, 236,184 yards of printed cloth, 1,468 yards of woolen colored cloth, 292 yards of cotton sarong cloth, 1,005,321 yards of artificial silk (not yarn or cloth), and 28 yards of artificial silk yarn or cloth, totaling 12,190,559 yards. This is of great importance to the future of our country's cotton textile exports. The bureau has now notified the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the China National Products Production and Sales Federation, the Shanghai Machine Weaving National Products Factory Federation, and other domestic goods groups to inform all cotton textile exporters to pay attention.</p>

<p>Banking and Finance Industries Prepare Assets Exceeding 100 Million Yuan</p>

<p>Due to the autumn harvest and year-end accounting, Shanghai's silver reserves are scarce, and the call loan rate in the money market has soared to four jiao. Faced with these difficult times, the banking and finance industries are eager for government assistance in stabilizing the market. The preparatory institutions jointly run by the two industries have total assets exceeding 100 million yuan, which is exceptionally ample, so there is no cause for concern. Yesterday, the call loan rate in the morning and afternoon had already dropped to 3.5 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Bank Reserves <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>

<p>After ceremonial greetings, Chen Yiting delivered the closing speech, stating that the association held the second Shanghai West National Products Exhibition to realize the plan of promoting member products and improve the efficiency of the Women's National Products Year movement. Since the opening, it has been three weeks, and it is fortunate that the citizens of western Shanghai have enthusiastically supported national products, completing the mission. The great significance of this is the only work to save the country, and is a leader for the whole country. However, the national products movement is a long-term responsibility to resist foreign goods and recover rights. Although the Shanghai West National Products Exhibition closes today, promoting national products and publicizing national products, it is hoped that the citizens of western Shanghai will continue to strive forward with a spirit of struggle, and will never close or interrupt. The cause of national products is deeply dependent on this. He also wished the citizens of western Shanghai good health and to work hard for national products. Next, Lin Guyun, director of the cooperative section, reported on the progress of the association's work. Xu Yunhui reported on the economic income and expenditure. Subsequently, Yu Yiqing, Yang Daxiang, Shao Daren, Xu Genghua, Pu Weirun, and Chen Xi gave speeches, which were very touching. Finally, the chairman led everyone to inspect the market, set off firecrackers and lowered the flags, announcing the closing.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Huang Mengtu, secretary of the association, the Shanghai West National Products Exhibition has been working hard to promote the sales of member products and is particularly determined to promote the Women's National Products Year movement. In the first month, the Shanghai South National Products Exhibition was held, and Ms. Tang Guanyu was invited to unveil it. In the twelfth month, the Shanghai West National Products Exhibition was held, and Ms. Lin Kecong was invited to unveil it, to show respect and assist in the grand event. The Shanghai West National Products Exhibition has been open for three weeks, and the results are excellent, creating a very good impression of the national products movement. The total sales exceed 100,000 yuan, indicating the enthusiasm of the citizens of western Shanghai for supporting national products, which has provided considerable financial assistance to the factories at the end of the year. Next year is the Student National Products Year. In order to fulfill the responsibility of mutual assistance and cooperation in completing the movement, the association has already decided to hold or participate in national products exhibitions in East Shanghai, North Shanghai, South Shanghai, the First and Second Special Zones of this city, and counties in China such as Tianjin, Jinan, Changsha, Fuzhou, Shantou, Fengxian, and Wenzhou, as well as national products exhibitions in the Philippines, Nanyang and other places abroad, to promote the sales of member products and promote the recognition of national products by the entire population. Currently, the association is designing plans for Fengxian and East Shanghai, and will gradually implement them when the opportunity is ripe.</p>

<p>Large Batch of Relief Personnel Dispatched</p>
<p>First to Anhui, Jiangxi and Six Other Provinces for Inspection and Relief</p>
<p>Inspection and Relief Not Passing Through the Hands of Others</p>
<p>The Shanghai Famine Relief Association for Various Provinces held a meeting the other day to allocate relief funds to various provinces, and after assigning personnel to investigate and distribute the relief, today the investigation and distribution personnel assigned by the association have set off to the disaster areas of various provinces. In addition, the Famine Relief Association is also carrying out relief work with rice, flour and winter clothing. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e143">Distribution of Relief Funds <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Famine Relief Association has determined that there are as many as 19 provinces affected by drought this year and plans to distribute relief funds of 30 million yuan. The most severely affected provinces are Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Hubei. Among these six provinces, Jiangsu, which is less severely affected, will receive a relief fund of 40,000 yuan, while the others will receive 80,000 yuan. These relief funds have been borrowed from the banking sector by the authorities of the Famine Relief Association, and the donated funds will be used to repay the loans, which has been negotiated. After the investigation and distribution personnel go to various provinces, they can send telegrams at any time, and the banks in Shanghai will allocate and remit the funds to the disaster areas for distribution.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Personnel Dispatched <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>After the investigation and distribution personnel for the first six provinces were decided, all provinces have been urgently urging them by telegram, as the winter is approaching. Therefore, the investigation and distribution personnel for each province are scheduled to set off to the disaster areas of each province in succession. Those who have already left Shanghai today include Hong San and Zhang Zepu, who are going to Anhui Province for investigation and distribution, and left Shanghai on the Jiangshun wheel. In addition, Qu Wenliu, who is going to Zhejiang, Li Dixian, who is going to Jiangxi, He Hengfu, who is going to Hubei, Zhao Yiwu, who is going to Hunan, and Zhang Lanping, who is going to Jiangsu, will all leave Shanghai in succession within days.</p>

<p>The Famine Relief Association will provide cash for the investigation and distribution in the first six provinces. The procedure is that after the investigation and distribution personnel arrive in the disaster area, they will conduct on-site investigations and consider the severity of the disaster and the amount of relief needed, and then telegraph Shanghai to allocate and remit the funds. The distribution of relief funds will also be presided over by the investigation and distribution personnel, and will not pass through the hands of others, so as to ensure that the disaster victims receive practical benefits. In addition, the association is also in great need of rice, flour, and winter clothing. The 100,000 stones of foreign rice that were previously planned to be purchased has been decided to be changed to domestic rice. The flour has been handed over to the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association for relief, and the winter clothing is all being packed.</p>

<p>To be Handled Together with Mr. Luo Qinghua</p>
<p>Chen Jian'an, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, and Luo Qinghua, Deputy Manager of the Silk Bank, are both natives of Zhuji, Zhejiang. Both men are deeply saddened by the fact that their hometown, Zhuji, has suffered a severe drought this year, with no grain harvested, and the disaster victims in various districts are eating tree bark and grass roots, and the starving are everywhere. Moreover, with the approach of winter, bandits are everywhere, and the people cannot sleep peacefully. Yesterday, both men received a report from the Zhuji County Branch of the Zhejiang Relief Association, which read as follows: "We understand that Zhuji County has suffered an unprecedented drought, with almost all the agricultural products destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of disaster victims are waiting to be fed and clothed. With the approach of winter, they are suffering from hunger and cold, and their livelihoods have been cut off. Recently, the disaster victims in the fifth, seventh, and eighth districts, which are the most severely affected, are using tree bark and grass roots to fill their hunger. Many have been without food for several days and have not been able to cook. Some have even been unable to find food, and the starving are everywhere. The reports sent to you about the disaster in Zhuji are all true. The members of our association in the county are heartbroken. After a regular meeting, we decided to raise 2,000 yuan to purchase 304 stones of corn, and distribute it proportionally according to the severity of the disaster in the fifth, seventh, and eighth districts. The fifth district will receive 106.6 dou, the seventh district will receive 122.2 dou, and the eighth district will receive 75.4 dou. We have invited Mr. Shen Peian of the Jisheng Branch to send personnel to the disaster-stricken villages of Meilei, Yuanbi, Xinqi, Tangren, Chayuan, Nanyuan, Xiyuan, and Pingshan in the fifth district (Shangnan), Shangyu, Shanghe, Chengshan, Xitai, and Changai in the seventh district (Daxi), and Pudai, Minyi, and Zhangcun in the eighth district (Xiaoxi), to select the truly helpless and distribute the corn to them. The relief grain is the best we can do, and the amount received by the disaster victims is very small. It is truly a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. This is a summary of the recent emergency relief work of our association. However, hundreds of thousands of disaster victims in the county are eagerly awaiting relief, and the situation is urgent. We have no resources to start with, and the members of our association are worried and anxious, and have no way to provide relief. We hope that you will do your best to raise money, and appeal to the National Relief Association and the Jiasu Relief Association for relief. The more, the better, and the sooner, the better, so as to save the disaster victims and give them a chance to start a new life."</p>

The legacy of the old family is desolate. Recalling the past, his actions and words were exemplary, and he was the best in the country and the hope of the village. Comparable to Yongshu, with morality and articles. We looked forward to him being a mountain and a beacon for our hometown. Who knew that the wind and rain would take away our bridge?

Thinking of the gentleman, with the quality of jade and the essence of gold. The great elegance is not made, and the atmosphere is magnificent.

<p>Please Reduce the Special Construction Donation in Accordance with the Ministry's Consultation</p>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Association telegraphed Chairman Huang Shaoxiong yesterday, saying, "To Chairman Huang Shaoxiong of the Zhejiang Provincial Government: The people of Zhejiang have suffered for a long time. We are delighted that you have come to Zhejiang to govern, and your benevolent reputation has spread, and we are all celebrating the restoration. Tracing the reasons why our people are suffering, it is due to the double oppression of natural disasters and man-made disasters, and the heavy surcharges on land taxes are the burden that our people cannot bear. The heavier the tax amount, the more the arrears, leading to the tragic situation of official and civilian difficulties today. Zhejiang Province has always been known for the heaviest tax amount. In recent years, the implementation of various new policies has all been taken from the surcharges on land taxes. Year after year, there has been an increase without a decrease, especially the increase of one yuan per tael of special construction donation and one yuan per stone of compensation gold. It is understood that this special donation was originally a military special donation. During the Northern Expedition in the 17th year of the Republic of China, in order to support the completion of unification, the people of Zhejiang did not dare to object. Later, the original plan was changed, and it was renamed as a special construction donation, and continued to be levied. The people have repeatedly opposed it, and our association has repeatedly asked for its abolition in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's regulations on reorganizing land tax surcharges and the order to abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes. However, it was used as a fund for reorganizing debts and was not approved. Now, I read in the Southeast Daily in Hangzhou on November 22 this year that the Ministry of Finance replied to the Provincial Government, and stated in the document on reducing the special construction donation that the Provincial Government listed a list of 3 to 4 million yuan on August 16 this year. This special donation has not yet reached the expiration date of the original case, and a preliminary reduction has been made from the balance of the debt fund. It shows that the people of Zhejiang are suffering, and the so-called debt fund now has a surplus, so this special donation should be reduced, which will not hinder the government's credit. In the midst of the drought, a reduction of one cent of burden for the people will leave one cent of vitality. Our association is deeply concerned that the provincial treasury is empty and does not dare to ask for a complete abolition. We only ask you to refer to the Ministry's consultation and temporarily reduce half of it, as a sign of your benevolence and love for the people. We hope you will investigate and implement the case. The All-Zhejiang Association in Shanghai kowtows."</p>

<p>Listing Points in Three Sections</p>
<p>Following the sinking of the Tongan Company's Tongan ship in Korean waters, the Chinese Seamen's Special Party Department, acting on a request from the relief committee organized by various seamen's groups, repeatedly negotiated with the company. Zhuo Huimin, the responsible party from the company, entrusted lawyer Zhang Henghai to allocate 1,200 yuan as an initial payment for the families of the deceased. However, no final settlement has been reached regarding compensation. According to a statement by standing committee member Yang Hu, the matter is divided into three points, as follows: (1) Because Bao Anfu, the manager of Tongan Company, went to Japan to collect insurance money but has not returned, the families of the deceased have been stranded in Shanghai for a long time. The living expenses issued to each person are only twenty or thirty yuan, and many of the families have come from remote villages, with thin clothing and in a state of hunger and cold, which is very pitiful. It is hoped that Zhuo Huimin, the responsible representative, will resolve the issue of compensation for the families of the deceased as soon as possible in accordance with regulations, to console the dead and reassure the living. Otherwise, I will have to advocate for strict negotiations in my official capacity to prompt the company to realize its responsibilities. (2) Navigation workers are originally the productive elements of the company, and the company should pay attention to protecting their lives and safety, or take out seaman's insurance on their behalf. When necessary, both parties can benefit. (3) At the same time, regarding the equipment on each ship, I sincerely hope that the competent authorities will pay close attention to it, striving for perfection to reduce the danger to navigation workers and prevent the unfortunate incident of the Tongfu ship from happening again. Because Tongan Company's equipment is simple and it has not joined the Shipowners' Association, it is difficult to achieve the effect of mutual encouragement among peers, so its measures are difficult to meet the requirements.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Harvard Ship Sinking: Salvage Abandoned <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Half of the Foreign Rice Recovered Yesterday</p>
<p>After the Harvard ship, which was sunk in the Huangpu River after a collision, the Jianghai Customs notified the shipowner to salvage it within a time limit and to pay 100,000 yuan in cash to the customs as a salvage deposit. After discussion by the shipowner, it was decided to abandon the salvage because the cost of raising the ship's hull was too high, and it would have to be repaired again in the future, which was not cost-effective. The 100,000 yuan will also not be paid to the customs. If the shipowner does not proceed with the salvage, the ship will be disposed of by the Jianghai Customs, and the shipowner will have no right to interfere. The ship has water insurance of 120,000 yuan, so the shipowner will not suffer a major loss in fact.</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Management Office hired eighteen divers to enter the water for salvage, 7,500 bags of foreign rice in various cabins of the ship had been recovered by yesterday morning, but all were stained with water. Half of the rice is still on the ship and will have to be salvaged again at the beginning of the new year.</p>
<p>The Hydrographic Bureau of the Navy Department specially issued Announcement No. 179, stating that a sunken ship occurred at the Shanghai port of the Yangtze River estuary, and a signal marking the sunken ship was established to alert all ships. The location of the sunken ship is in the fourth section of the Huangpu River, 139 degrees north from the tide observation point in the park, at a distance of 2.2 chains, which is 121 degrees 29 minutes east longitude and 31 degrees 14 minutes north latitude. The upper part of the sunken Harvard ship is exposed above the water. The location of the sunken ship on the chart should be marked with the symbol for "exposed at low tide." The above position is the location of the stern of the sunken ship, and the direction of the ship's hull extends 260 feet from that point at 29 degrees north. The marking signals are on the foremast and stern flagpole, with two constantly illuminated vertical green and white lights at night (green above white), and a green flag displayed during the day. Because a part of the ship's hull extends into the waterway, all passing ships must be extra careful to avoid endangering the salvage work. All ships should pass to the west of the sunken ship.</p>

<p>Jewish Representatives in Shanghai Petition the Japanese Ambassador</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that on Monday (24th), Dr. A. Tsukazaki and three other representatives of the Jewish Community Association of Shanghai visited the Japanese Embassy to meet with Ambassador Arima to state that the government of "Manchukuo" is encouraging anti-Jewish movements in Harbin and that the Japanese judges employed by them are arbitrarily abusing Jewish residents in Harbin. Representative Tubas read out a resolution passed at a meeting of the association at the Shanghai Jewish Club on the 18th of this month, stating that the Japanese chief of detectives in Harbin actually issued a report expressing sympathy for the murderer of the Jewish Gaspur and accusing Jews of participating in the assassination of the Russian emperor and leaning towards Bolshevism. This kind of dishonorable slander should be denied by the "Manchukuo" government. Representative Israel also stated that in June 1933, Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigemitsu officially sent a letter stating that Japan would never tolerate anti-Semitism. He deeply believes in Shigemitsu's declaration and expects the Japanese government will not deviate from this policy. The Japanese Ambassador replied that he deeply sympathizes with the delegation's assistance to the Jewish compatriots in Harbin and promised to send a copy of the resolution to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in his country.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday instructed various organizations in the city, stating that the Municipal Government's Order No. 11387 states: "The Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Business Letter No. 29262 states that if agricultural associations, labor unions, fishermen's associations, chambers of commerce, and industrial and commercial guilds have doubts about relevant laws and regulations, they should submit a request for interpretation to avoid errors. However, the submission procedures should first be submitted to the local competent authorities for review and instruction. If they are unable to answer, the competent authorities should add detailed opinions based on the law and local facts and forward them for review and handling. Recently, it has been found that the above organizations often directly submit requests for interpretation of laws and regulations to the Ministry, or the wording is too simple, or the meaning is obscure, or even chapters and clauses are cut apart, and facts are concealed, in order to obtain a favorable interpretation to use as a tool to deal with the other party. Various malpractices are inevitable. For the sake of prudence, the Ministry requires that all organizations must follow the above procedures when submitting requests for interpretation of laws and regulations and must not directly submit them to the Ministry. All competent authorities should first review such cases. If there are indeed doubts, they should forward them to ensure brevity and prudence. In addition to separate consultations, it is appropriate to consult for compliance, etc." It is ordered that the bureau forward these instructions for compliance.</p>

<p>Guests Feel at Home and There is No Space</p>
<p>The Paramount Hotel's Christmas banquet dance cost as much as 15 yuan per banquet. A week ago, people rushed to reserve seats, making it difficult to handle. There were not many good seats left, and they were fully booked. Later arrivals could not get a seat even if they threw a lot of money. Its grand occasion was unprecedented. Therefore, the lively scene in the hall last night broke the record of all Shanghai nightclubs. In the lounge, there are murals depicting ancient ladies playing. The crystal windows are bright, and the lights are shining, making people feel like they are in a dream. The dance hall is beautifully painted, and balloons are hanging everywhere, making it extremely colorful. There were as many as 1,200 guests that evening.

<h3 id="e169">Re-Trial of Xue Baorun's Grandson's Property Dispute Case <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Hua Yihong is Unwilling to Participate</p>
<p>Declares Abandonment in Court</p>
<p>Hua Lihou, the son-in-law of the late paint tycoon Xue Baorun, believes that his wife also had the right to inherit the millions of dollars of property left by his father-in-law. Although his wife passed away early, she gave birth to two sons, Yihong and Yigu, and a daughter, Manyun, who can inherit in her place. Later, because Yihong expressed his unwillingness to inherit the property, Hua Lihou, as the legal representative of Yigu and Manyun only, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Xue Baorun's sons Xue Gansheng, Yansheng, Jiasheng, Gensheng, and Kunzhong to divide the estate. After two trials by the First Special District District Court and the Second Branch of the High Court, Hua won the lawsuit. However, the Xue brothers were very dissatisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court for a third trial, hoping to win the final victory. The lawsuit has been going on for two years and has not yet been concluded. Recently, after review by the Supreme Court, it was deemed that the previous judgments were not thorough enough, and the entire case was returned to the Second Branch of the High Court for a new trial. Yesterday afternoon, the Civil Division Chief Li Dong and two judges, Ye and Cai, specially convened a collegiate bench to summon both parties and the main witness Hua Yihong for questioning. According to Yihong's testimony, Yigu is my younger brother, Manyun is my younger sister, and Xue Gansheng and others are all my maternal uncles. I am unwilling to participate in this lawsuit of my younger siblings against my maternal uncles. Because my maternal grandfather and maternal grandmother treated me very well, I do not want to divide their property. Moreover, a man should be self-reliant and should not rely on inheritance. Even if my younger siblings win the lawsuit in the future and divide the property, I will never covet it. Even if they want to divide what they have obtained equally with me, I am still willing to abandon it and not accept it. I have this ambition and will never change it. Judge Li pointed out that the word "abandon" has two meanings: one is to abandon the claim to the right of inheritance from the Xue family, and the other is to abandon the claim to divide the property obtained from the analysis with Hua Yigu. Judge Li asked Yihong to make a clearer statement about which aspect he was abandoning. Yihong immediately stated without hesitation that he was abandoning his claim against his maternal uncles and was unwilling to participate in the lawsuit from beginning to end. The court verified the testimony. Because the lawyer representing the defendants Hua Yigu et al. filed a motion for postponement, the court adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Zhang Guoxun's Father's Land Deed Lawsuit Awaits Judgment <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Supreme Court Remands for Retrial</p>
<p>After the sports figure Zhang Guoxun married Ms. Zhu Qiaozhen, his father, Zhang Xietang, felt that he had a good son and daughter-in-law who would take care of him and entrusted them with the management of the family affairs. He handed over all the family property and deeds to Guoxun for safekeeping, including a land deed. Later, Zhu Qiaozhen took the deed away, and the monthly rent was also collected by her for eight or nine years. Last year, Guoxun and Zhu suddenly fell out and filed a lawsuit in court, requesting a divorce. However, after three trials, it was ruled that Guoxun's claims were not sufficient to constitute grounds for divorce, and his lawsuit was rejected. Guoxun, unable to get a divorce, became even more resentful. He asked Zhu to return the land deed, but she claimed that her father-in-law Xietang owed a certain lumber company 6,000 taels of silver in mortgage. She borrowed money from her brother to repay the debt, and the deed was handed over to her brother for safekeeping as collateral. She refused to return it. Guoxun discussed the matter with his father, Xietang, who then filed a lawsuit against his son and daughter-in-law, requesting the return of the land deed, claiming that the deed was originally handed over to Guoxun for safekeeping, but now he is old and his son and daughter-in-law do not support him. He requested a judgment ordering the return of the land deed and the rent collected over the years. After two trials by the First Special District District Court and the Second Branch of the High Court, Xietang lost the lawsuit. He was dissatisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court. Recently, the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Second Branch of the High Court, instructing them to re-examine the following two points: (1) How did the disputed land deed come into Zhu Qiaozhen's possession? (2) How did Zhu Qiaozhen hand over the deed to her brother? Therefore, the branch court specially opened a hearing yesterday afternoon. Zhang Xietang's representative lawyer, Wu Linkun, detailed the dispute, stating that the land deed was taken away by Zhu Qiaozhen privately, as Guoxun had already testified. Although Zhu claimed that she borrowed money from her brother to repay the mortgage debt and handed over the deed to her brother, there was no evidence to prove it. It was suspected that the brother and sister colluded to embezzle the land. It was requested to abandon the original judgment and order the return of the original deed. Zhu Qiaozhen's lawyer claimed that the handing over of the deed to her brother as collateral for the loan was agreed upon by Zhang and his son. After mutual debate, Judge Li adjourned the hearing for a scheduled judgment.</p>

<p>Zhao Baoshan Sentenced to Two Years in Prison and Fined 3,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Ren Sida's Appeal is Rejected and Still Sentenced to One Year</p>
<p>Yang Jianping, who defected in the Minbian Incident and served as the director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, colluded with Zhao Baoshan to inflate the price of land purchased by the bureau and divide the profits equally. Liu Shufan, who succeeded Yang, and Ren Sida, the manager of the Shanghai Savings and Remittance Branch, were also accused of using the name of Daixunji to embezzle bureau funds to purchase government bonds, all of which were acts that harmed the national treasury. The Procuratorate of the First Special District District Court prosecuted the case according to law. The Criminal Division of the same court sentenced Liu and others to imprisonment ranging from one year to two and a half years. All defendants were dissatisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. Among them, Zou Yu and Liu Shifang, the defense lawyers of Liu Shufan and Yang Peichang, submitted detailed reasons for appeal, stating the facts of the case and arguing that the sentences imposed in the first trial were inappropriate and requesting a reversal. The prosecuting prosecutor also appealed, arguing that the sentences imposed in the first trial were too lenient. After repeated hearings and investigations by the Second Branch of the High Court, Judge Yu, together with Judges Zhao and Zhou, took their seats yesterday afternoon and announced the judgment. The sentences in the original judgment regarding Liu Shufan, Yang Peichang, and Zhao Baoshan were all revoked. Liu Shufan and Yang Peichang were both declared not guilty. Zhao Baoshan was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 3,000 yuan. If he chose to commute the fine to imprisonment, three yuan would be offset for one day of imprisonment, and the imprisonment period could not exceed one year. He was also deprived of public rights for five years. The other appeals of the prosecutor and Ren Sida's appeal were rejected. Therefore, Ren Sida must still be sentenced to one year of imprisonment according to the original trial, and the sentence will be executed after it is finalized.</p>

<p>Public Security Bureau Has Sent Ten Thousand Year Book to Court</p>
<p>The abbot of Longhua Temple, Monk Xingkong, sued the former abbot, Monk Yuanzhao, in the District Court for infringing on temple property. Later, Monk Minfeng of Hongshan Temple, west of Dananmen on Zhonghua Road, accused Yuanzhao of converting Hongshan Temple into commercial housing without permission, collecting rent for his own benefit, and transporting all the Buddha statues to Longhua Temple for placement. His request was to order Yuanzhao to restore the temple, transport the Buddha statues back, and punish him as he deserved. Prosecutor Wu Deying summoned witnesses several times for questioning, and the facts were clarified. The case was prosecuted in the Criminal Division, and Judge Shao Qinzhi opened a court hearing. The details of the cases have been reported in previous issues. It is known that the evidence of Longhua Temple, such as the Ten Thousand Year Book (there are two copies, one stored at the mountain owner Lu Mingzhao's place, and one kept in the temple), was taken away by Yuanzhao when he left the temple. When he was arrested this time, one copy of the Ten Thousand Year Book was seized and kept on file by the Public Security Bureau. In order to clarify the truth, the District Court sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, requesting that the Ten Thousand Year Book be transferred to the court for reference, so that there would be a basis for the matter. The deeds to all temple properties were recorded in the book. After receiving the letter, the Public Security Bureau sent the book to the court the day before yesterday. It is now known that Judge Shao has scheduled to continue the hearing at 2:00 p.m. on the 26th of this month (i.e., today), and ordered Xingkong and others to attend the court for questioning at that time, and notified the defendant's lawyer to attend the court to defend him. It is expected that there will be a grand debate at that time.</p>

<p>New and strange scams in Shanghai are emerging endlessly. Recently, the family of Hong Junzeng, a student at Fudan University (whose family lives in Yongjia, Zhejiang), suddenly received a telegram from the student, stating that the school building was destroyed by fire yesterday, and the bedding and luggage could not be taken out in time. It is now the cold winter, and the bedding and cotton clothes must be replaced. Please quickly remit 200 yuan to a certain hotel in Nanshi, Shanghai. Hong's family believed it to be true and immediately sent someone to Shanghai with bedding and 200 yuan. They went to the hotel specified in the telegram to visit Hong, but he was not there. They went to Fudan University and met him, only to find out that it was a scam. Fortunately, they did not remit the money to the hotel as instructed in the telegram, and the loss was limited. At this time of year-end, there are many victims of scams, so it is hoped that students and their families will pay more attention.</p>

<p>Sucaiyage Greatly Affected</p>
<p>Yesterday's Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" reported that the Municipal Health Bureau, due to the recent discovery of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle imported to the city, consulted with the Public Works Department and jointly issued a notice to the Cattle and Sheep Industry Association to temporarily ban cattle imports for two weeks. As a result, the market price of beef suddenly skyrocketed, from 9 cents to 20 cents per pound. In addition, there are only about 200 heads of cattle in the city, which is not enough to meet the daily needs. In two or three days, the city will be cut off from beef, and Sucaiyage (beef cooked in a pot), a dish in Japanese cuisine, will also be greatly affected. According to a clerk at the Mikasaya Meat Store, a Japanese business on Wusong Road, the daily beef consumption in the city is 100 heads in the Public Concession, 50 heads in the French Concession, and the rest in the Chinese area. Although the stores have a considerable amount of inventory, the source of supply has suddenly been cut off, and the price of meat will inevitably rise. At the same time, the price of pork will also increase accordingly.</p>

<p>Mediation Fails, Formal Lawsuit to Follow</p>
<p>Xu Liangqi, a local resident of 52 Wenlin Road in the French Concession, is 27 years old. His parents are deceased, leaving him with over 100,000 taels of gold in fields and property. When his parents were alive, he was betrothed through a matchmaker to Ms. Xu (age 29), the daughter of Xu Zhitian, a fellow villager from the western Xu Jia Hui Catholic Church. They married in 1924. Initially, the couple's love was strong, lasting over a decade, and they had three sons and one daughter. Unexpectedly, after his mother's death, Xu began living off his inheritance. His attitude changed abruptly, and he started wandering about, squandering his wealth, leaving little remaining. His wife repeatedly劝劝 him, but he refused to listen. He then became acquainted with a Ms. Tang, residing at 19 Tianyou Lane, Haige Road, and began cohabiting with her. They have since had a child together. Xu wanted to bring Ms. Tang home to marry her, but Ms. Xu refused, leading to a breakdown in the couple's relationship. Quarrels became frequent, even leading to violence, with Xu beating his wife. Unable to endure the abuse any longer, Ms. Xu took her children and sought refuge with relatives. She retained lawyer Wang Shizong to file a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the Special Second District Court, requesting mediation for a legal separation from her husband. The petition stated that she married Xu Liangqi on the 19th day of the 12th month of the lunar calendar in 1924, and for 11 years, they lived in peace and had children: Changhua, currently five years old; Xiangen, four years old; Sanmao, two years old; and Yinlin, eight years old. This year, however, the petitioner has been frequently beaten by the respondent for no reason, and she reported the injuries to the police. After mediation by relatives Xu Zhou, Xu Zitian, Xu Xiaoyan, Xu Yougen, and Yao Jinxiang, they reconciled. On October 23rd of this year, a written agreement was made, stipulating that neither party should have affairs or engage in improper conduct, and that both parties should uphold proper behavior and refrain from further abuse. However, after the agreement was signed, the respondent continued to beat the petitioner and threaten to kill her. He also took money and turned off the lights, dismissing the tenants to avoid being seen. The petitioner dared not return home. The respondent spends his days and nights away from home. It has recently been discovered that he is cohabiting with Tang Bao Bao, the daughter of Tang A’xian, at 19 Tianyou Lane, Haige Road. They had a child on the 28th day of the 10th month of the lunar calendar. He maliciously abandoned the petitioner and intends to bring Tang Bao Bao home, demanding day and night that the petitioner move out and let him do as he pleases. Her aunt Xu Zhou can testify to this. Such circumstances constitute a violation of the reconciliation agreement. According to Articles 3 and 4, it is impossible to continue living together, and her life is in danger. Therefore, she has no choice but to request a separation, with the children under her care. All assets should be divided equally to avoid waste, ensuring that the children's education and living expenses are covered in the future, and that the petitioner's life can be temporarily sustained. The court approved the petition. Yesterday, Judge Tu Shenjie of the Civil Court convened a hearing for mediation. The petitioner and her lawyer attended, recounting the situation. As the respondent Xu Liangqi did not appear, the official ruled that mediation was unsuccessful and instructed that a formal lawsuit be filed.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Animal Disease Prevention Center to Prevent Foot-and-Mouth Disease Outbreak <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Disease Has Been Found in Livestock Within the City</p>
<p>A Large-Scale Inspection Will Be Conducted</p>
<p>Foot-and-mouth disease is a livestock ailment. Once discovered, domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and pigs are at risk of infection, and it can even affect humans, spreading rapidly and posing a significant danger. The disease originates from a filterable microorganism, difficult to see even with the highest-powered microscope. It is present in the saliva, tears, nasal discharge, feces, blood, milk, and muscles of infected animals. If other livestock become contaminated, infection is possible. Even-toed ungulates, such as cattle, sheep, and pigs, are most susceptible, especially cattle, followed by pigs and sheep. After infection, symptoms appear in about one to seven days. Initially, body temperature rises to around 40 degrees Celsius, appetite decreases, and milk production suddenly drops. After one or two days, blisters appear on the oral mucosa, the back and tip of the tongue, the inside of the cheeks, gums, and tip of the nose. Body temperature decreases to normal levels. After another three or four days, the blisters rupture, and the epidermis peels off. In addition to the oral symptoms, the coronary band, interdigital space, and teats of the infected animals also become hot, followed by blisters that rupture. The hooves develop ulcerated lesions, making walking difficult. In mild cases, recovery is expected within two to three weeks. In severe cases, death occurs in a few days. While the mortality rate is low in mild cases, the loss to the dairy industry is enormous. The mortality rate in severe cases is very high, over 70 percent. If infants are infected, they develop malignant enteritis. According to reports from veterinarians at the Animal Disease Prevention Center (jointly operated by the Ministry of Industry's Central Agricultural Experiment Station and the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau), foot-and-mouth disease has been found in livestock in Shanghai, most commonly in yellow cattle and water buffalo, and is gradually affecting dairy cattle. The outbreak is most prevalent in the southern city and Zhabei, accounting for about 50 percent. Fortunately, it is a mild case, and the mortality rate is low. To prevent and eradicate the disease, the center has held two meetings with the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, and the Public Concession Bureau's veterinarians. It has been decided to conduct a large-scale inspection. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will strictly guard against the disease in all kinds of livestock. All milk and meat should be cooked before consumption to prevent infection. If any livestock are infected, the above agencies should be notified immediately for guidance and assistance with disinfection. The center has printed a pamphlet titled "Important Information on Foot-and-Mouth Disease in Shanghai," providing detailed instructions, which has been distributed to milk parlors and related agencies. The center has also submitted reports on the epidemic situation and prevention measures to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau and the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, which will be forwarded to the Ministry of Industry and distributed to various provinces for inspection and prevention. Veterinarians have been dispatched to Jiangsu and Anhui to investigate and determine prevention strategies.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Fire at Iron Factory Due to Oil Stove Pipe Leak Kills Six, Injures Two <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Four Dead...Two Injured in Critical Condition</p>
<p>Zhao Jinyuan, a local resident, 42 years old, residing at 43 Lane 4, Oujia Road, Zhoujiazui Road, Hongkou, runs a machinery iron factory. Therefore, he opened the Zhao Jinji Machinery Iron Factory downstairs in his residence, employing dozens of workers. Yesterday morning, around 7:10 AM, six workers were rushing to manufacture military water bottles. They used an air pump stove to produce the outer shells of the water bottles in front of the motor room. Unexpectedly, the oil stove pipe suddenly leaked, causing the oil to shoot out and splash onto the motor engine, causing an immediate fire. The fire spread rapidly, quickly reaching all around the building. Smoke and flames spread everywhere, making it impossible to control. At that time, the six workers who were working tried to put out the fire, but to no avail. They were overcome by smoke and fell unconscious in the motor room. As the fire raged, the motor room had only one door for entry and exit, making it impossible to put out the fire inside. Fortunately, the Central Fire Brigade received a warning and rushed fire trucks to the scene to extinguish the flames. They broke through the wall to drag out the six workers. Four of them had already been burned to death, and two were severely burned. Firefighters worked hard to save the other houses upstairs and downstairs, preventing the fire from spreading. After about two hours, the fire was completely extinguished, but the motor room was completely destroyed. The two injured workers, Yao Yongxin, 20 years old, from Suzhou, and Zhu Tianrong, 19 years old, from Changzhou, were rushed to the hospital by ambulance. Their injuries were severe, and their lives were in danger. The four workers who were burned to death were Qi Xiaopei, 17 years old, from Liyang; Mao Rongkang, 21 years old, from Changzhou; Shen Xiliang, 21 years old, from Wuxi; and Huang Jinhai, 15 years old, from Chongming. The fire truck sent the bodies to the morgue for autopsy. The Jiading Road Police Station also sent officers to investigate and file a report for questioning.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association previously received a letter from the United Association of Citizens of the First Special District, requesting notification to the Public Concession to increase security forces. Because it is now the height of winter, bandit activity is more severe, and adequate preparation is necessary to protect the area. The association has forwarded the situation to the Public Concession, urging them to pay attention. Yesterday, the Public Concession responded with a letter stating, "Received your letter of December 14th, forwarding the letter from the United Association of Citizens of the First Special District, requesting an increase in security forces for winter defense. The Police Department is well aware that bandits are most active during the winter months. Protecting the area is something that has been considered. Please rest assured."</p>

<p>Zhenze Water Levels Low</p>
<p>Old Wharf Blocked</p>
<p>Recently, due to the winter season, water levels in waterways everywhere are low, making it difficult for ships to travel, especially smaller boats to Huzhou. Recently, small boats from Shanghai to Huzhou, and boats towed by companies, are unable to pass once they reach Zhenze due to the shallow water. Various shipping companies in Zhenze City have recently dispatched shallow-draft civilian boats to transfer goods and passengers to avoid disrupting transportation. However, after passing the difficult shallow channel of Zhenze, the waterway is often blocked by cement and gravel boats near Old Wharf, about 30 to 40 li from Huzhou, sometimes preventing passage for an entire day. This often causes delays in Huzhou-bound boats. Inland waterway bureaus have requested that authorities take measures to clear the cement and gravel boats (many of which are hired by cement factories to transport stone for mud).</p>

<h3 id="e187">Telegraph Bureau Specifies New Method for Change in Telegram Fees <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Change for amounts of 5 cents or less can be paid in auxiliary currency; above that, change can be given.</p>
<p>For amounts of 1 cent or less, postage stamps can be used for payment.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau implemented the method of calculating telegram fee change according to postal rates from December, as ordered by the Ministry of Communications, it has been two decades. However, the volume of telegrams at the bureau is enormous. Besides the telegram fees that are whole numbers in national currency, the rest all involve change. Since the implementation of the new method, senders of telegrams almost always pay for telegram fees in silver dollars and demand change from the telegraph bureau, requiring the bureau to prepare a large amount of subsidiary currency notes for change every day. In recent days, subsidiary currency notes have been exceptionally scarce in the market. Therefore, the bureau has specially stipulated three new methods: (1) For telegram fees of 5 cents or less, the sender shall pay the subsidiary currency according to the exchange rate announced by the post office (including silver dimes, dime notes, and copper coins, etc.). (2) For telegram fees of 5 cents and 1 point or more, if the sender pays in silver dollars and requests change, the bureau shall pay the subsidiary currency according to the exchange rate announced by the post office (including silver dimes, dime notes, and copper coins, etc.). (3) For amounts of 1 cent or less, if the sender uses postage stamps or is willing to accept postage stamps instead of copper coins for change, it shall be handled accordingly. The above methods shall be uniformly implemented from the 29th of this month. Yesterday, it has also been announced to all receiving and dispatching offices for general knowledge.</p>

There were over 14,000 poor children attending the meeting at all locations. Representatives from Lianhua and American Fox, two major film companies, were specially dispatched to film the event. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM, and everyone left happy and excited. At the entrances of each location, many people who received the information late and did not receive admission tickets were still crowded, showing expressions of disappointment. This event was a pioneering effort, but it achieved such great results that it will be a good model for those who continue to organize such events in the future, making it easy to solve problems.</p>

<p>The Wuxi Shanghai Fellow Association, since the start of the third General Solicitation in July, publicly elected Rong Zongjing, Kuang Zhongmou, and over a hundred others as team leaders. Since the solicitation began four months ago, the association deemed its success quite satisfactory and scheduled a celebration for the afternoon of the 23rd at the association's hall on Qipu Road. Commemorative silver trophies, cups, and shields, and commemorative badges were publicly awarded to express gratitude. The most successful solicitor this term was team leader Kuang Zhongmou, who secured over one thousand points, followed by team leader Pu Liankui with over six hundred points. The total amount solicited reached over 5,800 yuan. Now that the term of the current council members has expired, the association deems it necessary to hold a re-election. It has appointed Kuang Zhongmou, Tao Renqian, Ma Shaoquan, Feng Xucheng, Yang Yinpu, Feng Yunchu, and forty-one others as members of the re-election preparatory committee to prepare for the re-election.</p>

<p>Drawing on Lots Today at the Lili Art Company on Sijing Road</p>
<p>The Shu region is rich in talent. For example, Su Dongpo of the Song dynasty and Zhang Chuanshan of the Qing dynasty were all masters of poetry, calligraphy, and painting, celebrated in the art world and passed down to later generations. Recently, the Daqian brothers, famous painters in Shanghai, have also been praised as the "Double Ding and Two Lu." It can be proven that the spiritual energy of Mount Emei is always bestowed upon someone in each generation. The young painter Liu Boyan possesses such talent. Five or six years ago, he was an outstanding student at the Changming Art School. While still in school, he attracted the attention of professors Wang Yiting, He Tianjian, Wang Geyi, and Wu Dongmai. Since graduating, he has worked even harder and devoted himself to studying the styles of the Song and Yuan dynasties. His art has become increasingly refined. Those who once noticed him are now full of praise. Boyan, however, remains humble and self-disciplined, focusing on his studies and immersing himself in fundamental learning. Therefore, his works, including flowers, plants, figures, birds, fruits, and vegetables, are both meticulous and expressive, resembling ancient masterpieces and completely devoid of current trends. He is truly a rising talent in the modern art world. He will soon exhibit his finest works at a solo exhibition at the Lili Art Company on Sijing Road on the 26th of this month. It is said that most of the pieces have already been reserved. Art connoisseurs and fellow artists who admire his talent are vying to visit, promising a grand occasion.</p>

<p>The Shanghai China Harmonica Society, in order to realize the national branch network plan, has had its president, Mr. Wang Qingxun, personally promote it in South China. In Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Kowloon, over a dozen branches have been organized, with membership reaching over 1,000. This remarkable success in just three months demonstrates the association's efforts. However, Mr. Wang was urgently called back by the head office, so he could not expand further. After staying in Shanghai for only one night, he rushed west to Kaifeng, where he has established the Henan branch. Although only two weeks have passed, 160 new members have joined. It can be said that he has been successful everywhere he goes. It is now reported that Mr. Wang has returned from his travels and is very busy reorganizing the association's affairs. He is currently planning to add a teacher training class, as there will be a great need for instructors as branches are successively established in various provinces. Furthermore, to improve the musical level of harmonica team members, they will all need to undergo teacher training. As for the original elementary class, due to the development of branches in other areas, as well as preparations for the fourth anniversary music festival and the editing of a special publication, the association's affairs have suddenly become busy. Therefore, in January, only evening classes will be offered. Information can be obtained in person or by mail from the association at 6 Mingzhi Lane, Guizhou Road, Jiujiang Road.</p>

<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 6: A Poor Girl Is Unashamed to Teach, Treating the Western Tutor as an Equal; Empty Reputation Is Not Worth Empty Heart</p>
<p>Zhao Guofu had no idea what was really going on, and continued, "Our Mr. Peer also privately manages German beer." Jia Duocai didn't know what to say, so he just said, "Oh." Peer also spoke in Chinese, "Very good, German beer, very good, very good. Xi'an, please introduce us to Mr. Jia." Jia Duocai gave a faint smile and said, "I work in the banking business, not selling wine." Although William didn't understand much Chinese, he could see that Peer had been rebuffed. He smiled and explained a few sentences to Zhao Guofu, who then said to Jia Duocai, "Mr. William says we should talk about the car business instead." Jia Duocai said, "Even if our bank is buying agricultural products in Shaanxi, we don't need to buy our own cars to transport them." Zhao Guofu said, "But thinking long-term, it's still better to have your own cars. Our cars don't burn gasoline, they burn fuel oil, which is much cheaper." Jia Duocai said, "Even so, it's not the time to buy yet. Buying cars now would be useless." Zhao Guofu said, "Even if you don't buy now, it wouldn't hurt if you wrote a letter to the bank introducing us." Jia Duocai said, "Our head office is in Shanghai. If you want to discuss this business, wouldn't it be better to contact Shanghai directly?" Zhao Guofu, hearing his tone, knew there was no chance to exploit. He reported this to his two German masters. Seeing the situation, the two Germans knew that the deal couldn't be made, so they got up to say goodbye. Jia Duocai, because they were foreigners after all, couldn't be too rude, so he shook hands with them and said goodbye until next time. After the Germans left, Jia Duocai felt a bit embarrassed towards Li Shilian, so he smiled and said, "Foreigners are really impressive when making decisions. Without any reason, they just go straight for it. Although they're just doing business, this kind of spirit is admirable." As he said this, he felt that he could cover up this meaningless behavior. However, the arrival of these two Germans had ultimately added some entanglement to him. (99)</p>
<h3 id="e220">A Summary of the Assassination Year of 1934 <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— He Shanggong</p>
<p>The calendar for 1934 is running out of pages. In the world, 1934 can be called the "Year of Assassinations." Now, let's open a summary account.</p>
<p>(1) Dollfuss Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss was known as the "Little Napoleon" in Europe. In July, he was assassinated by members of the Austrian Nazi Party. People, mindful of the eve of the outbreak of World War I in 1916, which also began with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, believed that a spark could ignite an unprecedented catastrophe. It was thought that the old feud between Germany and France, with Germany trying to succeed in the Danube River basin and expand its influence to Southern Europe, Austria would bear the brunt. Italy, France, England, and Russia did not want Austria to be incorporated into Germany, making Austria a buffer zone. Therefore, after Dollfuss's death, Italy stationed troops on the border, observing the situation closely. Whether Germany was really behind this incident is still in question today.</p>
<p>(2) Alexander King Alexander I of Yugoslavia was traveling to Marseille by car on October 9. Amid a grand welcome, a killer, Kalman, suddenly drew a pistol and shot at the king. King Alexander was shot four times and died instantly. This was the "Marseille Massacre" that shocked the world. It is said that Kalman was a member of the Ustasha terrorist party. Some say it was an ethnic struggle, but it actually had serious international implications. Now, this matter has reached the League of Nations. In order to appease the situation, the League of Nations will conclude an international convention to crack down on terrorist acts. Hungary has also denied expelling Yugoslavian overseas Chinese, and Germany has also advocated German-French friendship. Hopefully this is the end of it, and the opportunity for the outbreak of war will not be promoted further.</p>
<p>(3) Barthou French Foreign Minister Barthou was also killed by a bullet, because he used himself to shield King Alexander. Barthou, a central figure in European politics for the past decade, became a victim alongside King Alexander. At the same time, Geneva also lost an important figure. He was a very astute and eloquent politician, and also an author. His assassination is not only a loss to France, but also a loss to Europe.</p>
<p>(4) Shi Liangcai The assassination of Mr. Shi Liangcai, general manager of Shen Bao, is considered a major loss to Chinese society, even acknowledged by foreigners. But, the body is mortal, the spirit is immortal. May Mr. Shi rest in peace!</p>
<p>(5) Kirov The assassination of Kirov, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, on December 1, was this the end of the assassination cases of 1934?</p>

<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>Before dawn, there is always a moment of darkness, but what replaces the darkness is surely light. Therefore, "childish clumsiness"</p>
<p>is precisely the prelude to "robust beauty."</p>
<p>Only with the humility of bamboo, the tenacity of a rubber band, and the passion of fire can truly immortal art be produced.</p>
<p>A seed, if kept to itself, will never change its form, but if thrown into the ground, it can produce many offspring.</p>
<h3 id="e222">The Writing Brush <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Yongcai</p>
<p>The writing brush, known as the "three-inch hair cone," has a history of over 2,200 years since its invention by General Meng Tian of the Qin Dynasty.</p>
<h3 id="e223">The Vague Records of Imperial Incense <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After I went inside to take a look, I immediately discovered many pieces of evidence: for example, the abundance of plaques dedicated to the gods, the cleanliness of the sweeping, and the splendor of the decorations, all of which were sufficient to show that the comical and laughable stories I perceived were indeed taken seriously by some people in the local area! They believed that thousands of years ago, there was indeed a fox with extraordinary powers who, because of his improper conduct, was punished by the Jade Emperor and specially descended to earth to cure all the sufferings of mankind, thereby repenting for his own sins. And because they had this belief, some people who fell ill actually got better after taking the "immortal remedy"!</p>
<p>The so-called Fox Immortal Pagoda was actually a very large temple, also with a very solemn and dignified atmosphere. In the main hall, there was also a very tall shrine, with two silk curtains embroidered with flowers hanging in front of the shrine, which should have been very bright and beautiful before, but now they have been stained old and dirty by incense smoke. In the middle of these two silk curtains, one could vaguely see a vermilion-lacquered golden-lettered spirit tablet inside, inscribed with nine regular script characters: "Spirit Tablet of the Imperial-Appointed Azure Fox Great Immortal." Below the shrine was an offering table, with candlesticks and incense burners, with red candles burning high and incense smoke lingering all day long, all supplied continuously by the devout men and women.</p>
<p>As for how the sick people came to seek treatment? This set of procedures is understood by nineteen out of ten Chinese people, and there were no special methods in the past. Just the same, a bamboo cylinder filled with bamboo sticks was held in the hands of the patient or their family members, first waved three times over the newly lit incense, as a sign of communicating with the gods, and then respectfully kowtowed, and slowly and carefully shook the stick cylinder. (209)</p>
<p>Although the writing brush is a small stationery item, it has already made a huge contribution to culture. The poets and men of letters of the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties all used it to pass down their works for thousands of years, didn't they? If it weren't for it, what would they rely on to reveal their masterpieces to future generations?</p>
<p>The tools used by warriors are called weapons; the tools used by scholars are called stationery. Superficially, stationery cannot defeat weapons. However, in reality, this is not always the case. Take the pen as an example: the pen of a lawyer—commonly known as a "knife pen"—can often cause someone's death between numbers. This kind of bloodless killing can be said to be even worse than weapons.</p>
<p>Logically, since the writing brush has over two thousand years of culture and history, it should be further developed and expanded by now. However, the opposite is true. Now, its position in the hands of scholars is gradually being shaken. The steel pen, which is replacing its position, is slowly becoming the main guest, which is truly a very lamentable thing. If we examine the reasons for this, half of it is because the intellectual class is too fond of Westernization, and half of it is because the manufacturers are too conservative and do not make improvements.</p>
<p>Every day, seeing the large advertisements for "XX Fountain Pen Great Sales" in the newspapers, one cannot help but sigh for this "writing brush that has contributed so much to culture" and the "tens of thousands of craftsmen who rely on it for a living"!</p>

<h3 id="e225">Reading and Becoming an Official <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>The greatest purpose of reading is "learning for application." Those who are illiterate and uneducated, if they want to "avoid being taken advantage of" in this era, unless they are rich in experience, can remedy their shortcomings, otherwise, they will inevitably fall into ruin.</p>
<p>However, the motives of the general public for reading are somewhat perverse, even eagerly wanting to become officials, hoping to climb out of the path of becoming an official, to make a fortune, to obtain honor, everything!</p>
<p>This is, of course, a fallacy.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the ancient proverb "excel in scholarship and then serve as an official, excel in serving as an official and then study" has its considerable reasons for existence, its application in the present is always somewhat inadequate. If reading is solely intended to achieve the goal of becoming an official, then the effect of education is inevitably too simple and too pitiful.</p>
<p>Regarding this similar issue, Wang Pingling once wrote a film script for "Bigamy," which was directed by the star Wu Cun into a film, and its powerful criticism is worthy of our attention.</p>

<h3 id="e226">Shanghai Colloquialisms in Shanghai Officialdom During the Tongzhi-Guangxu Period <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Shanghai Communication Society</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are all kinds of people with all kinds of understandings. Then, let's talk about the Shanghai officialdom's observations of Shanghai during the Tongzhi-Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, which may be an interesting thing.</p>
<p>Chen Qiyuan, who served as the Shanghai County Magistrate as a descendant of the famous "Haining Family," said in his "Yongxian Zhai Notes":</p>
<p>"Since the Western powers opened trade in Shanghai, more than ten li outside the North Gate were designated for foreigners to reside in, and the foreigners paid rent for it annually, which is called the Concession. The Concession is divided among England, France, and three countries, and all public affairs are handled jointly by the Chinese-foreign Tongzhi and the consuls of the three countries. Local officials no longer participate in anything except for cases of murder and theft."</p>
<p>This is talking about the situation in the Concession. Although it is only a few simple sentences, he clearly stated that the opening of the Concession was after the opening of trade; he also knew very well that the opening of the port and the opening of the Concession could not be confused. During the Tongzhi-Guangxu period, the relationship between the Shanghai local officials and the legal rights of the Concession was exactly as he said, but at the time, the situation was extremely complex, and he was too fond of words and unwilling to say more.</p>
<p>Then, he wrote further, saying:</p>
<p>"The barbarians and Chinese are mixed together, the population is vast and numerous, and wealthy merchants and wandering people from all directions gather together. Brothels and妓館(prostitution houses) gather like the wind, residing in rows of houses, relying on foreigners as protectors, and the officials dare not scold them, and the authorities cannot question them, and they are becoming more and more prosperous, almost to the point of 花天酒地 (debauchery). When I was in charge of county affairs, I wanted to curb them slightly, but I was unable to do so, and I once ordered the local security guards in the foreign concession to secretly investigate them. Those with names numbered more than 1,500 houses, and 花烟館 (opium dens) and saltwater妹 (prostitutes from Hong Kong/Macau) and freshwater妹 (local prostitutes) were not included."</p>
<p>According to the above, since the mingling of Chinese and foreigners in the Concession in 1853 (the third year of Xianfeng), about twenty years had passed by the time Chen Qiyuan became the Shanghai County Magistrate in 1871 (the tenth year of Tongzhi), and there were already more than 1,500 brothels alone, not including others, and its deformed prosperity had undoubtedly become concrete.</p>
<p>He then narrated:</p>
<p>"Prostitution is prevalent, already surpassing the world. Since the Tongzhi era, foreign prostitutes have also come across the sea, flaunting their coquettishness, flirting with their eyes, in order to divide the profits of Chinese prostitutes. Thus, Chinese and foreigners are one family. Gentlemen from near and far, fond of pleasure-seeking, all choose the foreign settlement as their preferred place for amusement. The foreigners' harvesting of China's wealth can be said to have reached every extreme."</p>
<p>Originally, the arrival of Western prostitutes in Shanghai was during the Tongzhi era. His sentence "Chinese and foreigners are one family" was indeed humorous, as the literati of the time called it.</p>
<p>Others, there was Yu Benyu, a native of Xiuning, Anhui, who served as the Director-General of the Zhejiang Maritime Transport Bureau in Shanghai, and belonged to the ranks of alternate Daotais. In his "Record of a Visit to the Western Gardens," he wrote about Hongkou and the British Concession. Although it is archaic writing, the silhouette of the Shanghai Concession at the time, the so-called "scenery of the foreign settlement," can still be imagined. The following is an excerpt:</p>
<p>"In the first month of Yihai (according to the lunar calendar, i.e., the first month of Guangxu), without</p>
<p>ten days of sunshine, occasionally the weather cleared, but I still had to work on the riverfront, so I was still unaware of the passage of time. Long Kaichen Sima came from Anhui in the spring and temporarily resided at the Bureau. The Bureau is located outside the south gate of the city, and it is quite cramped. Shen Chen always thought of traveling north, because the essence of Shanghai is gathered here, and those who come from afar all yearn for it. ····· I, along with Qingyun, Anhui Sheng, and pulled Kaichen, the Li Pavilion, shared a sedan chair to Lao Zha. ··· Each left their sedan chair and rode in a horse-drawn carriage, letting go of the reins to travel. About ten miles, we arrived at the Hongkou Grain Storage Depot. (According to the Haikou Transportation Bureau's affiliate office) The three-room building was built along the river, and the sound of wheelboats and barges was heard in the harbor, which was not worth lingering over. So we boarded the carriage again. . . westward, from then on, it was a plain with gardens and willows. ··· Looking far away at the Chun Shen River, white boats and black awnings were as chaotic as flying birds. On the streets, the dust from carriages and horses, Chinese and foreigners, was mixed and chaotic, and lightning flashed and stars raced. Kaichen, having never seen such a sight before, couldn't help but clap his hands and exclaim. Suddenly, at a place where green trees surrounded a bay, the carriage stopped, and we saw everyone standing on the grass. At that time, fragrant carriages, precious horses, brocade clusters, and flower groups were everywhere. ··· There was a square well by the roadside, and there was also the ancient Jing'an Temple, but we did not visit it because of the detour. (The following omits the description of visiting the garden)"</p>

<h3 id="e227">Ten Thousand Cheer as China Beats Western Union Four to Three <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Western Union Once Took the Lead Three to Zero</p>
<p>China Scores Four Consecutive Goals to Recover Lost Ground</p>
<p>Auction of Soccer Ball Raises Two Hundred and Ten Yuan</p>
<p>A dramatic Sino-Western charity football match was held yesterday at the Shen Garden football field, with the opening kick performed by Mayor Wu. Over ten thousand Chinese and Western ladies and gentlemen who enjoyed the spectacle and contributed to charity. Throughout the ninety-minute match, the game was full of twists and turns. China initially conceded three goals but ultimately scored four, turning defeat into victory, to the jubilation of the crowd. After the match, Mayor Wu presented the award, which was accepted by Chinese team captain Li Ning. Furthermore, the soccer ball was auctioned off, with Mr. Ma Changsheng purchasing it for two hundred yuan. The total amount raised that day is estimated to be over six thousand five hundred yuan, and a formal announcement will be made by the Xie Jin Association in the coming days.</p>
<p>The Two Sides Exerted Themselves and Found It Difficult to Settle</p>
<p>At three o'clock, the Chinese and Western teams lined up on either side. Mayor Wu slowly walked to the center of the field, and reporters from various newspapers scrambled to photograph the opening ceremony. After entering the field, a silver whistle sounded, and Mayor Wu kicked the ball for the Chinese team, kicking it into the opponent's territory. Then he returned to his original seat and watched the game. At that time, China made a concerted effort, with the potential to establish itself in the enemy's camp. Center forward Dai relied on his nimble figure, led the team to attack, passed two levels in a row, and directly attacked the goal, forcing three corner kicks, but unfortunately, he did not gain an inch. The Western Union team's crisis just passed, and they launched a large-scale counterattack, adopting a triangular offensive formation of center forward and left and right wings, breaking into the formation. Center forward Simon's last shot was only inches away. The Chinese team went out again, with a great momentum. Right-winger Zhong Yongshen was in the lead of the entire team, and the enemy's defender was Ennis, the famous goalkeeper Smithon, who was not vigilant enough, so he was able to move around for a while. Sun Jinshun got his supply, and shot from flat ground. Cochrane seemed to have divine help, pushed it to the ground, and rolled away beside him, diagonally out of the net. Zhong also passed the ball, but center forward Dai's kick was a little high, and the ball went into the sky. Zhong sent the ball three times, but Li Yichen was eager to succeed and shot it askew. The Western Union team encountered danger three times, but was able to remain safe and sound. The five forwards were very brave and advanced at full speed. China was besieged and sent out urgent appeals in all directions. Li Ning, Jiang Shanjing, and Chen Hongguang defended in separate routes, and Feng Yunyou responded from the middle, and the situation gradually eased.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Western Union Scores Two Consecutive Goals <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Before long, the Chinese forwards roamed around the enemy's goal again, looking for a gap to enter. Sun Jinshun diverted the tiger from the mountain, but Dai's kick was weak and was picked up by the goalkeeper who bent down. Zhong got the ball passed from Dai and happened to be near Li Yichen in front of the goal, so he passed it to him. Li's actions were improper, and he lost the opportunity. Unfortunately, things happened one after another. Dai passed to Li, and Li quickly kicked the ball and shot it into the net. At that time, China's attack became more urgent, but if not for the goalkeeper Cochrane's effective defense and rescue, it would be difficult to maintain safety. After a long time, Chen Hongguang threw the sideline ball, hinting to Sun Jinshun, who passed it in front of the goal. Dai headed it, hitting the inside of the goal. The score between the two teams was two to three, only one point apart. The audience shouted loudly, and the warriors were brave and strong. Zhong was blocked by Xu Tuo, and Hongguang shot towards the goal. Logan headed it but not far enough. Sun Jinshun advanced by leaps and bounds, and with a kick of his iron legs, he got Feng Yunyou's help and headed it into the goalpost. Li also used Sun and Dai's supply to hit the goalpost. The Western Union team escaped from death and their spirits were a hundred times higher. Right-winger Foon quickly entered the side area, attacking the goal alone. Lu Zhongen pushed it out after falling to the ground, and Bausell continued to advance, without any objection, scoring a goal. China's repeated attacks were all blocked by Western Union's Logan and Xu Tuo. A chaotic phenomenon occurred within China. After a stalemate for a short time, Western Union's midfielder Frolaf shot from flat ground, and China lost two consecutive goals, both at the last twelve minutes of the first half.</p>
<h3 id="e229">China Completes a Great Achievement by Turning Defeat into Victory <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, the two armies contacted, but before three minutes had passed, China's bad luck had not yet receded. The forwards were in a position to advance, but the rear could not avoid being empty. Walter turned from left to right, and Foon rode in alone, looking around with no one in sight, carrying the ball to the goal. Lu Zhongen left the goal to save the danger, but slipped and fell on the way, and the ball went into the net in response. After losing three goals, their fighting spirit declined, and the future seemed difficult to be optimistic about. However, the Chinese athletes had fought on the battlefield for a long time. At this difficult and difficult time, they worked extra hard and struggled. Gu Shangxiang passed far to the front of the goal, and Sun Jinshun made it a 3-3 draw. At that time, the situation changed greatly, and China controlled everything, freely and easily. In the last fifteen minutes, the Chinese five tigers cooperated and made a miraculous achievement. The ball was first brought in by Dai, Yongsen responded on the right, and then proceeded from  Chen to Sun, in a variety of ways. The Western Union's interior was in great chaos, and the goalkeeper went out, and Wanxianghua shot it from the left, achieving a great achievement, and the joy was overflowing. China won with a score of four to three. The referee was Le Xiurong, and the sideline officials were Shen Huichun and Aquesheng.</p>

<p>A Large Disparity of Forty-Eight to Twelve</p>
<p>Still Playing Against Dongya at Datong Tonight</p>
<p>On Friday, Against Jinan in Zhenru</p>
<p>The Central National Martial Arts Sports College basketball team, with the remaining prestige of dominating Kyoto, led its troops to conquer Shanghai. The first battle against Datong University was held at the Datong University basketball gym at seven o'clock last night. After the addition of Li Zhenzhong, the Chinese representative of the Far East Games, the National Sports University has become even more perfect, like a tiger with wings. The lineup has become more complete and compact. The Datong team was originally a third-rate team in Shanghai, and the outcome was expected long ago. Therefore, the competitive situation was completely one-sided. As a result, the National Sports University won by a large margin of forty-eight to twelve. The ticket revenue from this game was donated by the Yixing Alumni Association of the school for disaster relief. Tonight at seven o'clock, the National Sports University will compete against Dongya Sports College, and the location will still be at Datong.</p>
<h3 id="e235">National Sports University <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The entire team is tall and strong, and they are all veteran generals who have been fighting for a long time. Their passing is wonderful, and their shooting is accurate, which is rare. The Zhang brothers, Changjiang and Changqing, are burly men, brave and good at fighting. Li Zhenzhong has a healthy body, flexible techniques, and smooth movements, which are exquisite. Wu Wenzhong's defense has been famous for a long time, and he and Gao Changming are old partners. The entire team is united and well-connected. Jinan and Fudan are probably not their opponents either. It is still unknown who will win against the Western Youth Mai Ling.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Start <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the five tigers of the National Sports University were vigorous and imposing. Datong tried hard to resist, and although they knew they could not win, they did not dare to slack off. They stalemated and the situation was tense. After five minutes, the high and low were gradually separated. From then on, the National Sports University shot from afar and near, and the score increased sharply. Datong gradually became unsustainable, overwhelmed and exhausted. In the first half, it was twenty-five to six, and the National Sports University had a remote advantage. From the beginning of the second half, the National Sports University once led by twenty-eight to six. Datong made a desperate effort and fought to the death against the city. They persisted for a long time. After ten minutes, the National Sports University continued to work hard, and the defense was not well prepared. Li Zhenzhong lightly described and wrote, and roamed under the basket, winning a lot of applause. In the end, the National Sports University scored forty-eight points and Datong scored twelve points.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Tonight <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>The National Martial Arts Sports College will compete against Dongya Sports College, and the location will still be at Datong University. The Dongya team is a buried hero and has not been noticed. However, the team is buried in hard training, and the lineup is well-organized, and the players are physically strong, no less than the National Sports University. They have defeated Jinan and Nanxing, which proves that the team's strength should not be underestimated. Tonight's battle will be a fierce one. Also, at 3:30 pm on Friday the 28th, the National Sports University will compete against Jinan University, and the location will be in Zhenru. The results of yesterday's battle are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e242">Preparation for the Chinese Art Exhibition in London <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Selecting Exhibits in Progress</p>
<p>A Preview to Be Held in Shanghai Next Spring</p>
<p>Regarding the International Exhibition of Chinese Art in London, after the Executive Yuan decided to establish a Preparatory Committee, with the Minister of Education as the Chairman, the Deputy Ministers of the Ministries of Interior, Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Education as Standing Committee Members, and Chen Shuren, Zhang Daofan, etc. as Committee Members, it has been actively proceeding. On the British side, Lord Lytton was invited to be the Chairman of the Executive Committee. The central diplomatic authorities of the two countries recently formally expressed mutual agreement, stating that the meeting would be held under the joint supervision of the two governments. Regarding the scope and selection of exhibits, our country's Preparatory Committee has organized a special committee, with Ye Gongchuo, Zhu Wenjun, Guo Baochang, Xu Beihong, Gao Jianfu, Li Ji, Tang Lan, Rong Geng, Chen Handi, Deng Yizhe, etc. as Committee Members, and Yang Zhensheng as the Director of the Special Committee. It is reported that the Committee Members in Peiping will first draft a preliminary selection catalog of the antiquities in the Palace Museum and the Antiquities Exhibition Hall, and will meet with the Southern Committee Members in Shanghai in February next year to examine the actual objects and make the final selection of exhibits. The main categories of exhibits are calligraphy, painting, ceramics, and bronzes, each based on historical development, for a systematic exhibition. Other art products, such as jade, statues, wood carvings, embroidery, and lacquer, etc., will be selected for their quality and, to the extent possible, will also be systematically exhibited. In addition to selecting from the Palace Museum and the Antiquities Exhibition Hall, it is also planned to solicit works of art or antiquities from the Academia Sinica, the Central Museum, the Historical Museum, the Northwest Scientific Expedition, the Henan Museum, the Peiping Library, the Shandong and Anhui Provincial Libraries, Peking University, Yenching University, and private collections, in order to present the entire spectrum of Chinese art.</p>
<p>In order to show the credibility of this exhibition, in addition to printing and publishing the catalog and photos of the exhibits at the time of departure, it is also scheduled to hold a preview exhibition in Shanghai before shipping to England in March next year. After the items return to China, they will be exhibited once again in Nanjing. The above decisions have been successively approved by the Preparatory Committee, the Council of the Palace Museum, and the Executive Yuan. During the preview period, the British side will send five selection committee members to China to work with the Chinese experts to make the final selection. However, China will still reserve specially important items and will not allow them to be exhibited abroad.</p>
<p>Regarding the safety of the exhibits, after the final selection of items, the Chinese and British committee members will supervise the packaging by expert experts, and both parties will sign and seal them, and then they will be unsealed by both parties under supervision during the London exhibition. In addition to implementing various practical protective measures during transportation, the most important one will be that the British Navy Department will send warships to escort the goods from Shanghai to Singapore, and then escort them back from Singapore to Shanghai. During transportation, loading and unloading, and during the exhibition in England, the Preparatory Committee will send special personnel and competent guards to supervise and protect them at all times together with the British personnel in order to ensure thoroughness.</p>
<p>It is said that this exhibition will be an unprecedented international art exhibition in China. It is expected that it will enable international people to gain the most profound and universal understanding of the artistic creativity of the Chinese nation. Moreover, the holding of this exhibition is in response to the request of the British people to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the British Emperor's accession to the throne, which will surely benefit the friendly relations between China and Britain.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Education in War Zones Nears Bankruptcy <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>More Than 100,000 Children Out of School</p>
<p>Girls' Normal School Closed, Boys' Normal School Teaching on Borrowed Land</p>
<p>– Security Teams Occupy the Education Bureau and Schools –</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) Education in war zones is on the verge of bankruptcy, with over 100,000 children out of school. Yutian County is particularly affected. This reporter interviewed a certain gentleman from the educational circles of Yutian who came to Beiping. According to him, before the incident, Yutian County had two normal schools for men and women, nine higher primary schools, and over 300 lower primary schools. Recently, the Education Bureau, the Public Education Center, and the First Higher Primary School, among other schools, have been occupied by security teams. Moreover, due to the unrest in the area, only the Boys' Normal School is勉强勉强 able to hold classes on borrowed land, with only twenty-two students. The Girls' Normal School has long been closed. Only three or four higher primary schools, including Ya Hong Qiao, Ding Jia Qiao, and Zhu Shu Wu, are勉强勉强 holding classes. No more than forty or fifty lower primary schools are open. The number of children out of school is countless. The reason schools cannot open is entirely due to financial difficulties and disruption by the security teams. Many middle-class families have moved to other places. It is estimated that over 1,500 households have fled to Beiping, over 700 to Tianjin, over 200 to Tangshan, and countless others to Lu Tai and other places. The whole city is in a miserable state, indescribable. Although some people have stepped forward to provide relief, their efforts are too weak to make a difference.</p>

<p>Student Roster Unable to Be Submitted to the Ministry Due to Unresolved University President Issue</p>
<p>– Education Director He Siyuan Promises to Petition the Ministry of Education Again –</p>
<p>(Quick Dispatch from Jinan) The issue of the president of the private Qi Lu University in Jinan has been unresolved for a long time, affecting the student roster, which has not been submitted to the Ministry of Education for record. To this day, the board of directors held a full meeting on the 5th of this month. Although Mei Yi Bao has been publicly recommended as president, Mei has been unable to come to Shandong recently and has not indicated whether he will take office. Chairman Kong Xiangxi has also not sent a telegram to Jinan. All the students' requests, the most important of which is the submission of the roster to the Ministry, have not been addressed. The students of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences of the university believe that the long-standing unresolved issue of the president and the inability to submit the student roster to the Ministry greatly affect their studies and the future of the university. Therefore, they publicly elected Yang Xuexian, Li Fengge, Ma Lin, and others as representatives to visit Vice Chairman Li Zhifan at his residence on Wei Er Road at 3:00 PM today (the 22nd). Li was unavailable due to other matters. The representatives then went to the Education Department to see Director He Siyuan. He personally received them. The representatives stated their purpose and asked He if the student roster had been submitted to the Ministry. He replied that he had petitioned the Ministry of Education, but it was rejected because there was no official president. The representatives then requested He to appoint the university president from the Department to avoid prolonged disruption of university affairs, so that the roster could be submitted to the Ministry as soon as possible, so as not to affect the students' future. He said that this would have to be petitioned to the Ministry of Education before it could be handled. The representatives then left and returned to the university. It is also heard that Li Zhifan recently received a private letter from Mei Yi Bao, which stated that Mei had not yet severed ties with Yenching University and that he would need to consider whether to take the position of president of Qi Lu University before making a decision.</p>

<h3 id="e247">Physical Education Normal School Entrance Examination Not Held This Winter Vacation <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Only One School Has Graduates This Year</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Education announced the subjects for the physical education normal school entrance examination on the first of this month, the physical education normal schools should have held the examination in accordance with the regulations. However, it is found that most of the physical education normal schools are located in Jiangsu and Shanghai, and only one school in Shanghai has graduates this winter vacation. The so-called entrance examination must have two or more schools to be considered a "meeting." If only one school has graduates, the educational administrative authorities can simply send personnel to supervise the examination. Therefore, it is heard that the physical education normal school examination may not be held this winter vacation. If an examination must be held, the Ministry of Education will issue a temporary announcement. However, a general examination will be held next summer vacation.</p>

<p>To Be Held Starting January 7th Next Year</p>
<p>The Education Bureau Organizes the Examination Committee</p>
<p>The graduation examination for middle school students in this city this year has been scheduled by the City Education Bureau to be held starting January 7th next year, as stipulated in the school calendar. All procedures are being followed by the various middle schools. Students who failed one or two subjects in the previous two graduation examinations for middle school students may participate in this year's examination to retake the failed subjects. Students who failed three or more subjects and were held back a grade may also participate in the entire examination. However, the reporting procedures should be handled by the original school in accordance with the procedures of previous years, that is, separate student rosters, grades, and two photos should be submitted to the Education Bureau for verification. The graduation examination committee for middle school students this year has been organized. In addition to Director Pan serving as the chairman of the committee, Zhi Chenbai, Xie Engao, Jiang Shuxun, and others have been hired as standing committee members. Tong Xingbai, Shou Chun, Wang Yuzhang, Ma Chonggan, Du Gang, Zeng Shengdian, Tang Jinbai, Zhang Yongchun, and Zhou Shanghua are committee members.</p>

<p>County Government to Protect Bailongtan Primary School</p>
<p>(Songjiang Correspondence) The monk Lan Feng of the Xichan Temple has repeatedly falsely accused the principal of Bailongtan Primary School over the Fenglong Temple issue, but the county court has refused to prosecute each time. This has been reported in the previous newspapers. It is now heard that the entire county's educational circles believe that the monk is undermining the school, which is disrespectful to the educational circles. Therefore, they jointly telegraphed the county government again yesterday, urging them to severely punish the monk as a warning to others and to provide protection to ensure the stability of education. The original telegram is transcribed below: To County Chief Jin of the Songjiang County Government, After investigation, Bailongtan Primary School in our county has been repeatedly disturbed by the monk Lan Feng of Xichan Temple, who has even demolished fences, destroyed public property, and falsely accused the principal, causing public outrage. We telegraphed you on the previous day, requesting that the monk be investigated and punished as a warning to others and to maintain education. Now, the county court has twice refused to prosecute the principal for obstructing freedom, as accused by the monk Lan Feng. This clearly shows that the monk is fabricating accusations and deliberately making trouble for the school. However, the school is a cultural institution, and the principal is a public official. It is not appropriate to allow an outsider to trample on them without providing protection. This would not only completely lose the dignity of the educational circles but would also encourage him to do evil and become even more reckless. We, Zong Kun, and others, are in charge of school administration and always strive for the smooth progress of education. Now, the monk is openly undermining education and slandering the principal. This is what we, Zong Kun, and others, are deeply concerned about. Therefore, we are telegraphing again, urging you to strictly investigate the monk and order him to compensate for all the destroyed school property as a warning to others and to ensure the stability of education. Sun Zongkun, Principal of Songjiang County Middle School, Zhou Dexin, Principal of Songjiang County Normal School, Liao Baoshan, Principal of Qixian Women's Normal School, Shen Shoujin, Principal of Jiangsu Provincial Songjiang Primary School, Tu Peiyu, Principal of Songjiang County Guanyinqiao Primary School, Bao Yongren, Principal of Songjiang County Yangjiaqiao Primary School, Xu Pengzu, Principal of Songjiang County Xidu Primary School, Tang Shaoqiu, Principal of Songjiang County Sijing Primary School, Cao Sicong, Principal of Songjiang County Huayang Primary School, Ni Xiangyan, Principal of Songjiang County Mojialong Elementary School, and others, respectfully offer this.</p>
<h3 id="e250">The Central Government Has Not Yet Issued a Clear Order for the Implementation Plan of the National Children's Year <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>The City's Children's Year Preparatory Committee Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Decided to Postpone the Opening Ceremony on New Year's Day, Etc.</p>
<p>The Full-Year Children's Program Will Still Be Held According to the Original Proposal</p>
<p>Since the National Government decided that next year will be China's Children's Year, the city's party and government organs have organized a Children's Year Preparatory Committee to be responsible for the preparations and have scheduled an opening celebration ceremony for Children's Year to be held at the City Hall on New Year's Day. They have also decided on a full-year children's program. All of this has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the City's National Children's Year Preparatory Committee, in light of the fact that the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education have not yet made a concrete decision on the implementation plan for the National Children's Year, believes that if Shanghai proceeds independently, it would be no different from Shanghai's Children's Year alone. Therefore, they convened an emergency meeting at the City Government yesterday to make a definite resolution. Those who attended were Li Dachao, Pan Gongzhan (representing Hu Shuyi), Li Tingan (representing Hu Jingxiu), Hu Shuyi, Wang Guanyi, and Qian Fugong as an observer. Li Dachao chaired the meeting, and Qian Fugong took the minutes. First, Committee Member Hu reported that although the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education were responsible for preparing for the National Children's Year, the National Government had not yet issued a clear order. If Shanghai were to proceed independently, it would be no different from this year's Shanghai Children's Year. Therefore, a definite resolution must be made at this meeting on how to proceed. The discussion then began: (1) Should the city's opening ceremony continue to be prepared, given that the National Children's Year has not yet been promulgated by the National Government? It was resolved that before the National Government issues a clear order, in addition to the full-year children's program continuing to be carried out by the responsible agencies and organizations according to the resolution of the first meeting, the opening ceremony and New Year's Day events will all be held in accordance with the national schedule after the central government issues a clear order. (2) Should the city government be requested to forward a request to the National Government to promulgate next year as the National Children's Year as soon as possible? It was resolved to be handled by the Children's Welfare Association. (3) Given that the opening ceremony has been temporarily suspended, should the special issues of the various newspapers be published as planned? It was resolved that materials should continue to be collected as usual and that all newspapers should be notified to publish them simultaneously with other parts of the country. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>

<p>Su Jielang, Director of the Children's Dental Hospital, was a well-known dental expert in the country. He was 26 years old and from Xiamen.

<h3 id="e261">On the Usefulness of "Scholars" <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Jia</p>
<p>Mr. Cao Juren lamented the "utter uselessness" of scholars. Although this statement seems to be very worldly-wise, in reality, it is not so. Emperor Xuan of Han did not use scholars because a "vulgar Confucian was out of touch with the times, favoring the ancient over the present, causing people to be confused by names and realities, and not knowing what to adhere to." The reason why Old Master Ni in "The Scholars" had to sell his last son, having been a poor scholar for thirty-seven years, was precisely because he "had read a few dead books and could not handle light or bear heavy burdens."</p>
<p>In fact, vulgar Confucians are not all "out of touch with the times." Such Confucians are truly "vulgar" through and through. There have been many non-"vulgar" Confucians in history. And it is precisely because of this that these refined scholars have become "useful."</p>
<p>Huang Zhongze perhaps had the lament "utter uselessness is a scholar" because he was "unappreciated." The reason why Old Master Ni was "useless" was precisely because, although he "couldn't even keep the youngest child," he could only complain to the actor Bao Wenqing and never had any thought of resistance.</p>
<p>Scholars are not "useless," but their "usefulness" is different.</p>
<p>Wearing a silk turban and holding a feather fan, simply preserving elegance; drinking bitter tea, playing with antiques, and hiding in a study to talk about foxes and ghosts, is just "helpless," isn't it? Doubt, depression, and sadness are precisely the characteristics of the dark side of a transition period. The remnants in the cauldron of the times, whether they are groaning or paralyzed in silence, are still just remnants. However, this attitude toward life is still a kind of "usefulness" because, objectively, it helps maintain the old era.</p>
<p>However, modern scholars are not limited to this. "Taking off their long gowns," they are no longer scholars in essence. Daring to gaze at reality, they understand: "Sorrow and pain we will surely have, and struggle will certainly be endless. We must combine courage and pain into one and carve out a path from constant struggle." They sing the lines of Yesenin's poem: "Death is not difficult, the difficulty lies in how to rebuild life," and throw themselves into the struggle for light. Such scholars can be said to be the "new type" of scholars; they are no longer the famous scholars burning incense and sipping tea in the Bitter Rain Studio.</p>
<p>Scholars are not "useless," but their "usefulness" is different, and therefore their value is also different.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Homecoming <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>The day I left this place, as usual, I got up at dawn. Barefoot and sturdy, I carried a tin bucket to the back of the house to shower. A-Man was a little sentimental today; although he was already twenty years old, it was his first time leaving home. He thought about how he would soon be far away in Singapore - what a resounding metropolis! There, he would be in contact with many strangers; he would be working all day in that shop by the coast, and that mischievous Lina would no longer be able to be with him every day.</p>
<p>(When will I be back after leaving?")</p>
<p>He asked himself that.</p>
<p>In the early morning, a cool breeze blew behind the house. The sun was still playing hide-and-seek, not yet climbing up. A rooster's crow woke up Lina next door.</p>
<p>They met by a coconut tree.</p>
<p>A-Man, leaning against the trunk of the tree, was also bare-chested. His strong physique often made women sing hymns of praise in their hearts. He put the bucket on the ground, his eyes fixed on her face. She seemed even more beautiful, with a lovely blush on her cheeks. He suddenly hugged her, shouting:</p>
<p>"Lina! I really don't want to go to Singapore!"</p>
<p>"What? Are you crazy? Your father is sending you there to make a fortune. A-Man, you haven't been there yet, it's really fun. You can walk on the road for half a day, looking at many new things and not wanting to eat. It's even more interesting at night. It's just that there are a lot of bad women... You have to be careful thinking of me..."</p>
<p>Her voice suddenly lowered as she said this. The first ray of sunlight shone up, illuminating her face as she lowered her head. A-Man raised her pointed chin with his hand; suddenly he noticed two lines of clear tears hanging on her face, which had previously been flushed with a lovely blush...</p>
<p>"Lina, are you crying?"</p>
<p>"·····"</p>
<p>She didn't answer, just shook her head.</p>
<p>"Why are you crying? I am... Didn't Hei Ying</p>
<p>say I'm going to make a fortune? You wait for me for two or three years, I will definitely come back. Come back and you..."</p>
<p>"But..."</p>
<p>"But what? Lina, tell me!"</p>
<p>Lina didn't say anything; the sound of calling A-Man was already ringing in the house. He threw her down and ran in. His father was putting on his clothes, and said to him:</p>
<p>"The train leaves at nine o'clock, we're leaving soon."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>He planned to change into a clean suit and take the hat out of the closet. His father muttered to him:</p>
<p>"A-Man, you're not young anymore. You have to know that our family is poor, even your mother has to go to other people's houses to be a nanny. You go to Singapore, work hard, save some money and bring it back..."</p>
<p>"I'll listen to you, don't worry."</p>
<p>"Are you ready? We're leaving."</p>
<p>"Let's go."</p>
<p>So, the father went ahead, and A-Man came out carrying a big bundle. The sun was already high in the sky, and there were voices everywhere. Turning his head occasionally, he saw Lina waving to him at the door of the next house...</p>
<p>A month later, at noon, the tropical sun was steaming on people's heads as usual. It was still that bundle, that face, although a little thinner. A-Man jumped off the train and went straight home. Sweat streamed down his back, soaking his white linen coat. His steps were limping, appearing a bit heavy. Some people by the road recognized him, saying:</p>
<p>"That's A-Man. Did he make a fortune, coming back so quickly."</p>
<p>However, in A-Man's ears now, it was simply full of sarcasm. He hissed uncomfortably, and felt his pocket, leaving only about one dollar. The closer he got to home, the more he lost courage; when he saw his father, how should he tell him?</p>
<p>His father was hoping he would save some money and come back!</p>
<p>However, he didn't know how Singapore had changed. Unemployment, theft, suicide, trouble... The peace he had when he worked in a foreign firm there five years ago had long become history.</p>
<p>Could A-Man, a Malay who didn't understand the ways of the world and grew up in the countryside, stand his ground in Singapore - a metropolis where economic panic had become acute?</p>
<p>So he came back...</p>
<p>He was familiar with the sandy road leading directly to his home. He was also familiar with the weeds by the road. He saw his own broken house from afar, with a coconut tree behind the house. The house on the left was Lina's: thinking of her, a smile appeared on the dusty corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>He pushed open the door with one hand and shouted:</p>
<p>"Dad!"</p>
<p>But there was no response. He put down the bundle and looked around in all directions, but there was no trace of his father. He thought, he probably went outside. So he ran to Lina's house.</p>
<p>"Lina!"</p>
<p>There was no response either.</p>
<p>Lina's mother came out. He grabbed her and asked:</p>
<p>"Do you know where my father went?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid he went to the plantation."</p>
<p>"Where's Lina?"</p>
<p>"When did you come back?"</p>
<p>Hearing the woman in the sarong answering irrelevantly, A-Man was very anxious and widened his eyes, saying:</p>
<p>"Just came back. Where did Lina go?"</p>
<p>"Lina? That's right, you're asking about my daughter... She got married the day before yesterday."</p>
<p>"Married! Heavens..."</p>
<p>As if an arrow had hit his chest, he walked out. He didn't go back home, just walked aimlessly under the scorching sun. He didn't know who Lina had married; nor did he know where to go, always following this sandy road...</p>
<h3 id="e263">Cocoon (5) <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Rin-yu Hayashi, Translated by Shizuko</p>
<p>We were sleeping on the grassy hill of a schoolyard spire overlooking an antique clock tower. The early summer sunlight glinted warmly from the new brass buttons, reflecting off our eyelids as we chatted idly. Suddenly, Sakai seemed to remember something.</p>
<p>"I still have those cocoons to deal with, don't I?"</p>
<p>"Ah, is your mother still working at the factory?"</p>
<p>"She won't quit, no matter what. She says, 'Until you graduate from school,' she'll keep working even if she has to chew on rocks." But in reality, it's hard for her to quit. Aside from working at the factory, there's no other way for my mother to live while I'm at school."</p>
<p>Sakai bit his lip, plucking at the grass on the hill. He spoke again, in a thoughtful tone.</p>
<p>"Lately, I've started to have doubts about this world. Take that factory, for example. There are still three hundred female workers working there. Most of them are girls from nearby farming villages, fifteen or sixteen to twenty-three or four years old. When they first arrive, they're young country girls with very strong bodies, but after a year or two, they return to the village with white cloths wrapped around their throats, or coughing, or with red eyes, or with festering fingers." Some even die in the factory like withered grass, and I've heard stories of girls whose hair got caught in the machines and crushed to death."</p>
<p>"The heavy, humid air and the ceaseless labor, the inadequate food—when I see those female workers whose young bodies are gradually being worn away, I think of the cocoons they're spinning in the boiling pots."</p>
<p>"Constantly being boiled, a thread so fine that the eye can't see it absorbs its life, gradually, gradually shrinking it, until soon it becomes a jet-black pupa—a useless corpse—floating on the surface of the boiling water."</p>
<p>"But on the other hand, if you look closely—aren't there people who are fattening themselves by sucking the life out of the cocoons, just like the spinning bobbins whirring above their heads?"</p>
<p>Sakai paused briefly, wiping the sweat from his forehead, and then said in a low voice:</p>
<p>"When I think about it—it's terrible—my mother probably won't be able to work safely in that factory until I graduate from university. For my mother, it's almost become a belief. She always thinks that it's her responsibility that the Sakai family declined, and she wants to make sure it can be revived no matter what. Not only that, but my mother undoubtedly feels a strong joy and a will to strive in educating me, her only son. I know that feeling... I know it very well."</p>
<p>"But if my mother is in that factory, isn't she just another one of those poor silkworms? An invisible thread is sucking away her life..."</p>
<p>I didn't know how to answer him.</p>
<p>A third-year student at a higher school—a winter day nearing graduation.</p>
<p>Late at night, Sakai braved the snow to come to my apartment.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>When I saw his bloodless face, like someone who had run out of a graveyard, I had an immediate, ominous premonition.</p>
<p>"My mother is dead! ...Too late!"</p>
<p>As I snatched the telegram he held out, I thought of the words he had predicted in the past, and a chill ran down my spine.</p>
<p>"Ah!?"</p>
<p>I didn't say anything. The quiet, old-fashioned eyebrows that I had seen in the room where the silk threads were turning in the silk mill immediately came to mind, but then immediately vanished.</p>
<p>"Too late! During the New Year's holiday, I begged my mother to let me suspend my studies no matter what. I begged her like that, saying, 'If I don't get you out of the factory, not only will I, as your son, be unable to bear it, but I feel an imminent and unavoidable danger, and I really can't rest easy.' When I returned home after a long absence, I could clearly see the deterioration of my mother's health. But my mother always cried and wouldn't listen."</p>
<p>He bit his lip, wiping away the tears that flowed.</p>
<p>But it's no use saying anything now. I have to go back tonight. I'm very sorry, but please lend me some travel expenses."</p>
<p>"Okay!"</p>
<p>I took out all the money I had and, treading through the snow, saw him off at the station.</p>
<h3 id="e264">On a Boat <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Cheng</p>
<p>Under the tangent formed by the square roof of the pier and the circle of the large building behind, the shadows of a group of friends were receding, receding, and finally disappeared into the evening mist.</p>
<p>The sky gradually sank. After wiping away the lingering tears, I sighed sadly and looked with longing eyes towards Guangzhou, which was already beyond the line of sight.</p>
<p>Downstream of the Pearl River, the boat sailed peacefully on the wide river channel, the muddy yellow water lapping against the hull, as if whispering. The banks were low dikes, covered with lychee and longan groves, with small farmhouses occasionally appearing in the dense gaps; wisps of smoke curling up. Farther away, vast rice fields stretched out, cut off by dark hills.</p>
<p>Year after year, I wandered with the heart of a vagabond, running around everywhere. When I felt tired of the city, I resolutely left, like a Gypsy, going from one place to another. I fell asleep as soon as I lay down. When I woke up, I had already arrived in Hong Kong, and the night view from the top of Victoria Peak was a little tired. The salty, fishy Hong Kong market slept silently. I borrowed a hotel room to stay in, taking advantage of the Asian Queen's northward voyage the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Once the boat left Lei Yue Mun, it was a blue sky and a blue sea, with clouds and sea connecting at the horizon. The passengers in the third-class cabin endured the heat emanating from the nearby engine room, barely able to breathe, the air congealing like a solid, hard block. People's minds were muddled, stinging, unable to sleep. Occasionally, jazz music leaked out from the first-class cabin, but it wasn't needed here. Our tiny hope was a little breeze.</p>
<p>This golden yuan nation's ship, everything is like this society, full of obvious contradictions, why does the first-class cabin have such extravagance and comfort, but in the third-class cabin, not even a little breeze can be obtained, this is a mystery; the mystery of the imperialists.</p>
<p>After pleading and begging, the yellow-faced compatriots on the crew finally used their benevolent grace, so we had three wind funnels. Here is a microcosm of Chinese society, with various gambling and Cantonese food, but spreading among this group are deception and selfishness.</p>
<p>Time is quiet in the late night, the yellow light soaking some travel sorrows, some loneliness, then lingering in the traveler's heart, making meager dreams, the place to arrive tomorrow should be a place of freedom.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Returning from the Volcano (5) <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Ru</p>
<p>Go! Even if you have only your last breath left, you must struggle to reach the volcano! Do not fear difficulties. No matter how difficult and dangerous the road ahead may be, you must desperately move forward. This is the best lesson for you in how to live your life. If you can reach the volcano, it will be like creating fresh and vibrant life in a desert-like existence in the future. The road of life is even more dangerous and difficult to walk than this. But if you risk your life to go—yes, you must have such aspirations, even if I die halfway before reaching my destination, I must move forward!—you will eventually reach your goal one day.</p>
<p>Go! Even if you have only your last breath left, you should move towards your destination.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, I mustered up the courage to approach Mr. Qin in one breath. He said unhappily, "You are walking too slowly. (There is another Little Yang who is as behind as I am.) Look, people have already returned from the volcano. Hurry up and leave, or you won't be able to catch the boat." At that time, I really wanted to say, "If we can't catch it, let's stay another night." But I was afraid of being scolded, and it was also impossible in reality, so I had no choice but to continue walking without daring to stop for even a second.</p>
<p>Suddenly, my left ear screamed a few times, and I saw stars before my eyes. I fainted on the sand.</p>
<p>"Hurry up and leave, don't rest."</p>
<p>Mr. Qin unceremoniously hit me on the back with a stick, which made me almost want to yell out.</p>
<p>"I'm not resting, I really can't walk anymore!"</p>
<p>"Why can others walk, but you can't?"</p>
<p>He actually started dragging me with his hands, and like dragging an object, without considering that I was a sentient being. In order to avoid being dragged and beaten by him, I had no choice but to grit my teeth and drag my legs, which weighed a thousand pounds, towards the volcano.</p>
<p>When teams of men and women returning from the volcano passed by me, seeing the many bright red bloodstains on their dark faces, I thought to myself that it was really not easy to go to the volcano once. Have I not suffered enough, and do I still have to bleed?</p>

<p>Yesterday was the Westerners' Winter Solstice Festival. Foreign firms were closed as a whole, and some Chinese banks that had joined the Foreign Chamber of Commerce also took a holiday as usual.

<p>This Month's Term is the Last Day</p>
<p>Military Reduction Squeeze Soars One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange was the last day of this month's futures trading. The foreign interbank rate was 0.5%, and market sentiment was relatively firm. The battle between bulls and bears was fierce, especially in the afternoon. No. 48 and No. 53 were both priced up, while No. 33, No. 50, and No. 78 were all sold off. Swap transactions were still lively. The squeezing was more intense in the last two rounds in the afternoon. The fluctuations this month were quite large, and the squeezing of shorts was greater than the squeezing of longs. However, because the quantities were not large, the situation was not too intense, but the trend was inevitably slightly off track. Yesterday's progress: The opening in the morning was relatively firm, and most rose by two or three jiao. Due to different swaps, there were slight differences. The second round turned into a squeeze of longs, and sales of No. 50 and No. 78 surged, and market prices fell back across the board, from one or two jiao to four jiao. The afternoon situation was more chaotic. Most of the front rows were squeezed longs, and the back rows turned into squeezed shorts, with the front rows falling by a small three or four jiao and the back rows falling by a large three or five jiao. The closing was late, and bulls and bears were still fighting. The front rows were squeezed shorts, and the back rows were flat. As a result, more prices rose than fell. Among them, military reduction rose the most, soaring one yuan due to squeezed shorts. Today, only one month's futures trading is done, and February futures are allowed to enter the market on the 29th. The future trend may be high first and then low. The total turnover was approximately 35 million yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>The Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market yesterday (24th) was dull but firm. Some stocks rose by as much as two yuan. There were not many sales, but because the company's profits in November were slightly lower, the demand was also weak. The bond market was quiet and mixed. Stocks on the small exchange rose and fell unevenly. Chicago wheat was dull, and prices were quite stable.</p>

<p>Yarn Squeezed Shorts, Cotton Unsupported</p>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but spot yarn business remained sluggish due to the year-end closure. Northern weather was cold and freezing, and purchases were especially weak. However, the standard yarn for this month was the last day. The market was still flat when it opened in the afternoon, but suddenly jumped wildly by 2.5 yuan at the close, to 187 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan compared to the closing price before the November delivery. After investigating the reason for the wild increase after the close, it was said that there were more than 1,000 bales floating short, and they risked closing out in the last round. Unexpectedly, the buying party saw the urgent squeeze and forcefully pushed up the price, resulting in this squeezed short phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Yarn Rose 2.5 Yuan in the Last Round <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>The standard yarn opened lower in the morning session because foreign cotton prices saw mixed gains and losses. It was heard that the spot yarn sales market was quiet because customer groups were mostly settling accounts at the end of the year, and demand was weaker. Each month fell by 0.3-0.5 yuan. The December yarn, which had long been rumored to have large accounts taking delivery, was the last day today. It rose slightly at the opening in the afternoon, up 0.1 yuan. The distant months continued to fall by 0.1-0.2 yuan. The second round of the current month rose by another 0.2 yuan, and the third round tightened by another 0.3 yuan. At the close, the bulls were forcefully pushing up the price, forming a squeezed short. Those floating short without goods prepared had to purchase at the market price to close out, jumping wildly by 2.5 yuan. The distant months were also dragged up by this, resulting in the current month rising by 3.2 yuan and the distant months rising by 4, 6, 7, and 9 jiao. It was found that Jifeng sold 300 bales, Yuekang 450 bales, Dafeng 350 bales, Hengde 600 bales, Mingde 1,100 bales, Gengfeng 400 bales, Yuande 350 bales, Yuantai 500 bales, Yichang 500 bales. Mingde bought 650 bales, Shenchang 900 bales, Dafu 350 bales, Yuda 350 bales, Zhenda 450 bales, Jinchang 300 bales, and Changfeng 950 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Increase/Decrease Stored Account Number</p>
<p>December 187.0 183.3 187.0 Up 3.50 118,50</p>

At the same time, New Orleans and southern cotton farmers also sold short, and the market situation was flat at the close. There was no market price this month, and the remaining months fell back by 4 to 9 pound notes.

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market in each month showed a trend of first stabilizing, then softening, then softening and then rebounding. The quotation for foreign wheat was about 3 jiao higher in Chicago and about 1 jiao and a half higher in Canada. After the opening price, there was extra-market floating and more absorption, and foreign wheat was slightly better, and people's hearts were more determined. The opening price for each month was about 1 fen higher. Afterwards, the major households did not move, the floating shorts vomited, and the market atmosphere loosened again, falling by 1 fen compared to the initial opening. Until the afternoon opening, it was still flat and soft at first, and then the Fujian gang slightly bought in, and there was also a drawing from the northern gang in this month, and the market atmosphere rebounded again. It was found that the factory output was not smooth and the chips were reduced, so the market was easy to rebound after softening. As a result, this month was slightly better by 2.5 li, January was better by 1 fen, February was better by 1 fen and 2.5 li, March was better by 1 fen and 7.5 li, April was better by 2 fen and 2.5 li, and May was better by 2 fen and 7.5 li.</p>

<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after the opening in the morning, each month showed a clear and stagnant appearance. Although the quotation for foreign wheat was better by about 1-2 jiao, due to the near closing, both inside and outside the industry were mostly collecting, so the transaction was sparse when the opening price was opened, and the price did not change. Until the afternoon opening, it was still hovering at first, and the price was also stable. At the closing, the market was slightly better due to the firm flour market, but the transaction was still light. As a result, this month was better by 1 fen, January was better by 2 fen, February was better by 1 fen, March was better by 3 fen, and the high-quality spot wheat rebounded by 1-2 fen. The medium and lower grades were flat. As for the factory's purchase, it was still active. The opening price for Guide wheat was 4 yuan and 5 fen, the second grade was 0.03 yuan, Yaowan wheat was 4 yuan and 3 fen, the second grade was 4 yuan, Luohe wheat was 4 yuan, the second grade was 3 yuan and 9 jiao and a half, Hankou wheat was 3 yuan and 8 jiao and 2 fen, the second grade was 7 jiao and 9 fen. It is estimated that Fufeng purchased 8,000 bags, Shenda purchased 3,000 bags, and Huafeng purchased 1,000 bags.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat bulls took profits sporadically, making it difficult to rise. Judging from this situation, the trend of rise and fall is indistinguishable, and will shift depending on the foreign market. Last week, the supply decreased by 2.933 million bushels. As for corn, due to the weather conditions, it is expected to promote the need for fodder and hinder the transportation of crops. It is reported that the United States purchased a large amount of Argentine corn, and the supply decreased by 908,000 bushels. Speculators are bearish on Chicago wheat. 22nd 24th Rise and Fall</p>

<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, the sources from each gang totaled more than 50 numbers (more than 8,000 stones of goods). Yesterday, the sources from each gang totaled more than 50 numbers (more than 8,000 stones of goods). Therefore, the initial opening was even more prosperous with the arrival of the source, and the trend continued to be sluggish. The sales market felt unsmooth, and people's hearts seemed firm, so the sellers all lowered prices to seek buyers, causing the market color to frequently show a downward trend, even with a spectrum of 3 jiao. However, at the same time, this drop was able to release the market, and the watchers all took action to compete for it, and the situation became active again. Although there was no particularly good image at the close, the price of thick japonica and late rice, etc., that were opened were slightly revised, and the Du Yangjian was allowed a small corner because the way out was not wide. However, the yin-bian Yuan goods were scarce and there was not much honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, the goods from each road in He Xia arrived for two days, totaling about 60 numbers. The market sales of white japonica rice were slightly active, the retail sales were still sluggish, each grade of jian rice barely stood firm, early thin rice was still active, yin-bian Yuan was sluggish, the market situation was that the price of white japonica rice was slightly more than one jiao, early thin rice was slightly less than one jiao, and yin-bai Yuan was slightly less than one or two jiao, and each grade of jian rice was flat and tired.</p>

<p>Price Reduction Transactions and Recovery of Prosperity</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival and storage of customer Xian rice were both thin, and the market stabilized. The price of foreign rice was slightly higher by 5 fen due to the desire of the merchants to sell. After a while, the appetite of the main street and the inland recovered. It was heard that 1,500 bags of Siamese rice, 5,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice, and 200 bags of broken rice were sold. The prices were all slightly lower by 5 fen. In the afternoon, Shan Da Cheng sold 10,000 bags of Saigon 60-grain broken rice No. 2 inferior Saigon, and the price dropped to 10 yuan. The arrival and sales of customer Xian rice were both small yesterday. The inland successively handled 1,500 bags, Beiyang handled 250 bags of red rice, and the main street handled 220 bags of Yuan rice. The other bags were not sold, and the market price did not rise or fall.</p>

<p>The soybean market situation is still rising. Although there are 3-4 thousand bags from the source, people's hearts are still tight due to the active sales channels. Yesterday, the Dada Xin Oil Factory in the city handled 1,000 bags of Guide beans, with a price of 3 yuan and 6 jiao and 2 fen. The market price was 2 fen higher than the previous market. Xin'anzhen beans were handled by Xichang Inland and Ningbo on the main street, with a price of 3 yuan and 5 jiao and 7 fen for more than 400 bags. 2,600 bags of Hankou Zha beans, with prices ranging from 3 yuan, 4 jiao and 7 fen to 2 jiao and 8 fen. 1,000 bags of Han Che beans, with a price of 3 yuan and 5 jiao and 4 fen. 700 bags of Han Chi beans, with a price of 3 yuan and 3 jiao and 3 fen. 1 car of Dalian Xicheng beans, with a price of 4 yuan and 1 jiao. 4 cars of Sipingjie beans, with a price of 3 yuan, 9 jiao and 4.5 fen. The above market prices, except for Hankou beans, which have increased water feet, which increases the cost by 5 fen per bag, so the selling price is also tight, so it is 5-6 fen higher compared to the increase, and the rest are 2-3 fen higher.</p>

<p>In recent days, the silk market has not seen much trading due to the upcoming Christmas and New Year holidays for Western merchants. Most of the exported goods this time are goods that were sold off earlier. This year, the silk market has seen a sharp decline in prices, resulting in a sharp reduction in transactions. The total export volume has decreased by 47% compared to last year, and one-tenth of that in 1926. The silk industry has always been the main foreign trade of our country. Since 1930, it has been declining, and in the past two years, it has plummeted. The impact on urban prosperity and rural economy is truly unimaginable. I hope that the authorities and the financial community will not take this serious problem lightly. The following is a comparison of the total export volume of raw silk in the past year and this year (although this year has not ended, it is not difficult to know the overall situation by reading this table).</p>

<p>Soviet Russia has always been the only consumer country of Chinese tea. Since the country has implemented the Five-Year Plan twice, it has made unremitting efforts to promote tea. According to news from Russia, the country's tea production this year is 12.5 million pounds, an increase of 40% over last year. Most of it is used for machine-made Gongxi and brick tea. It is expected that tea will be self-sufficient in three or four years. In the future, China's tea trade with Russia is likely to gradually decline.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market showed a firm trend. The association's price list was 18 yuan and 7 jiao for ordinary spot crude white sugar, 18 yuan and 8 jiao for local goods, 5 yuan and 2 jiao and a half for transshipment goods, 14 yuan for ordinary 8-9 grade Dutch red sugar, 14 yuan and 7 jiao and 8 fen for high 10 grade, 18 yuan for No. 1 fine white sugar from local factory, and Chao Bang opened more than 300 bags of new Chao green sugar, with prices ranging from 11 yuan and 8 jiao to 11 yuan and 2 jiao. The trend was flat and tired, and the sales channels are inevitably slightly sluggish as the Gregorian New Year approaches, and the market has a tendency to continue to loosen. Although the number of new Diao green arrivals is small, it is difficult to exclusively occupy a good position due to the squeezing of Chao green sugar.</p>

<p>Opening Price is Slightly Better by 2-3 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday's soybean oil and peanut oil market conditions were still outstanding. The main reason is the disappointment of tax exemption (when the tax was levied earlier, the tax was pledged by the merchants, and now it must be collected according to the amount). At the same time, when the arrivals are few and the inventory is thin, and each sales outlet is moving, the trend is likely to continue to rise. The market was strong in buying yesterday, and the market price rose again. It is estimated that peanut oil rose by 3 jiao, and 300 pieces of warehouse were traded, 100 pieces of Boer, 100 pieces of light skin, soybean oil rose by 2-3 jiao, 50 pieces of waste oil were traded, 150 pieces of Lun Dalian oil, 200 pieces of Lun Shaji oil, 20 pieces of sand ship, and 200 pieces of Lun Niuzhuang oil, 100 pieces of sand ship.</p>

<p>A small thief steals something worth dozens of copper coins, and he will be taken to the authorities. He will be detained for a month at most, and a week at least, before being released. In the past, although there was no death penalty for theft, if the value of the stolen goods exceeded one thousand yuan, the thief should be beheaded.</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Wen of the Han dynasty, someone stole a jade ring from in front of the seat in the Gao Temple. When the thief was caught, the court officials tried him and reported that he should be executed and his body left exposed in the marketplace. Execution meant killing him. Emperor Wen was furious and said, "This man is unprincipled and stole the late emperor's belongings. I wanted to punish his whole family, but you are trying him according to the law. This is not how I intend to jointly inherit the ancestral temple." The thief had only stolen a jade ring from the Gao Temple, but Emperor Wen felt that sentencing him to death was not enough. He was determined to exterminate his entire family before he would be satisfied.</p>
<p>Now, Yi Peiji has stolen treasures from the Forbidden City worth over 50 million yuan. The treasures of the Forbidden City are the treasures of our country. Yi Peiji, as the director of the Palace Museum, embezzled the treasures, amounting to a huge sum of 50 million yuan. Even if Yi Peiji were a judge, how should he sentence himself?</p>
<p>Yet Yi Peiji himself forgot that he was a great thief of the nation, and even boasted to his wives and concubines, allowing his wife to flaunt the stolen treasures, parading them in large banquets. (According to reports, the discovery of this huge case of treasure theft and fraud was due to Ms. Cui Zhenhua, who noticed that the jewelry, hairpins, and fox fur coats worn by Yi Peiji's wife at a certain banquet were rare treasures in society. Therefore, she became suspicious and investigated, which led to the cracking of such a major treasure theft case.) Yi Peiji, as a great thief, forgot that he was a thief, and his wife, wearing the stolen goods, forgot that they were stolen and dared to wear them openly in public. If they were not insane, how could they disregard the law and treat punishments with such contempt?</p>
<p>Only by believing in the promise of reward and the certainty of punishment, according to national law, if Yi Peiji, who embezzled treasures while being in charge of them, is not arrested and severely punished, how can it serve as a warning to other thieves in the world? It is rumored that Yi fears arrest and has fled to the Northeast, which is a possible reality. Although the Northeast is a place to hide dirt and accommodate filth, Yi Peiji stole national treasures, and his character is not only bankrupt but has also been sentenced to death long ago. Although some people may be tempted by his wealth and temporarily harbor him, they will never trust him fundamentally. The government should make every effort to arrest him and bring him to justice, so as to appease the public and intimidate thieves.</p>

<p>— Yonghui</p>
<p>The child's mouth was slightly open, and air was only coming out, not going in. He had been wearing the "hundred family garment" for three days. It was said that the hundred family garment could ward off evil, but for some reason, the child's illness grew more serious day by day, and even the hundred family garment lost its power to ward off evil.</p>
<p>"The Bodhisattva Guanyin who saves from suffering and delivers from difficulty, please save my child," the mother said, pressing her hands together in front of her chest and kneeling on both knees on a stool. She silently chanted, her complexion not as stiff as before, now appearing unusually kind and pitiful. Tears fell from her eyelids as she moved them slightly. "As long as the Bodhisattva can ensure my child's recovery, I will eat vegetarian food for the rest of my life and become a nun if necessary."</p>
<p>"I'll pray to Guanyin Niangniang for you again, no need to cry," Sister-in-law Shan, not knowing when, had strolled in, patting the widow's shoulder, showing sympathy and concern. "I'll get some incense ash from Guanyin Niangniang for you, and a yellow talisman, and I guarantee it will work as soon as you eat it! The Bodhisattva trusts me the most."</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Shan was a well-known good person in this village. If anyone wanted to pray to the gods or ask for divination, they always needed her. The villagers believed that her prayers and divination were more effective than anyone else's because she ate vegetarian food and was a disciple of Guanyin Niangniang. She herself said that Guanyin Niangniang had appeared to her in a dream and told her so in person. Moreover, her divination fee was very cheap, only 200 coins each time.</p>
<p>Incense ash and yellow talismans had been swallowed! The child's illness still did not improve.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law Zhang, this can't go on. You should get a doctor to treat the child," several neighbors advised her.</p>
<p>The widow disagreed because she only had this one precious orphan. If he took the wrong medicine or if something went wrong, who would she rely on? She always believed that doctors could only diagnose minor ailments like stomach aches. More serious illnesses could only be cured by revering the Bodhisattva. Among the Bodhisattvas, none was more powerful or effective than Guanyin Niangniang. She had heard many stories from the *Journey to the West*. Even Sun Wukong with his great abilities could not do without the Guanyin of the South Sea, let alone her? In the past two years, she had truly become a worshiper of Guanyin.</p>
<p>The hundred family garment could not drive away the evil spirits, and the incense ash and yellow talismans had lost their effectiveness in saving lives. One early morning, the child silently bid farewell to his beloved mother and passed away.</p>
<p>A large crowd of neighbors stood in the widow's room, each offering words of comfort.</p>
<p>"Sister Zhang, please think of the deceased and don't cry."</p>
<p>"The person is already dead, crying is useless!"</p>
<p>"You should prepare for the funeral!"</p>
<p>"I knew long ago that this child couldn't be saved," Sister-in-law Shan said, frowning, her gray hair shining, and her pale face looking unusually serious. "Guanyin Niangniang gave me a dream the night before last, saying that this child came to collect a debt. His mother owed him a debt in a previous life. You see, once the debt was paid, he left! This was predetermined in a previous life, crying is useless. I knew long ago that he couldn't be raised." Sister-in-law Shan said, squeezing into the crowd at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e301">Pockmarked Chen San <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— TT</p>
<p>Pockmarked Chen San has lost his job again. He sighs all day long, and his appetite is particularly bad. Compared to when he was a clerk at Rongchang Candle Shop, he eats almost a whole bowl less per meal. His face is also getting thinner, and his cheekbones are sticking out high, looking just like a monkey's face. His mother, Auntie Dalai, is also much more haggard because of his unemployment. On the one hand, she is worried about the rice in the rice jar, which is so shallow that she can see the bottom and can't fill it up. But what worries her most is her son Pockmarked Chen San's face, which is getting so thin that it's frightening. She went to the Fude Nunnery to pray to the Buddha and knelt before the Bodhisattvas in the City God Temple. From the fortune sticks given to her by the Buddha and Bodhisattvas, she carefully deduced that a benefactor would appear soon, so there was no need to worry. The Buddha and Bodhisattvas are all-powerful and most reliable. Their words can't be wrong, right? So she waited, waiting for the benefactor to descend.</p>
<p>But as the days passed, the benefactor didn't even show a shadow. Rice had been borrowed from the neighbors several times, and judging from the looks on their faces, it would be difficult to ask again.</p>
<p>Pockmarked Chen San is a little different from his mother. The sighs have gradually decreased, and he spends his days talking happily or going to the streets with his friends to watch plays. His appearance is completely different from before. Although he is still thin, he looks energetic.</p>
<p>Auntie Dalai is undoubtedly hoping that he can continue on this happy path and not ruin his health with worry. However, when she touches the rice in the rice jar, her heart turns cold. She feels that her son's idleness is not quite right. So she says:</p>
<p>"You should find something to do to earn money. It's not good to be idle all the time."</p>
<p>"Of course! But it's not easy to find a job!" Pockmarked Chen San has never spoken to his mother so sharply.</p>
<p>Auntie Dalai's face darkens, her nose feels sore, and she can't speak. Tears fall from the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>In the past, when Pockmarked Chen San saw his mother so sad, he would surely comfort her, saying:</p>
<p>"There's no need to be like this. We'll slowly think of a solution."</p>
<p>But today, he takes his anger out on his mother and speaks sharply. With fire in his eyes, he rushes out the door.</p>
<p>Auntie Dalai watches her son's back. She thinks that her son's attitude has changed quickly, "He doesn't want to wear the short black cloth shirt he's worn for two or three years anymore, saying it's too ugly. He combs his hair so it shines, and it's fragrant and smooth. He plays all day long, regardless..." Auntie Dalai can't help but sob.</p>
<p>Pockmarked Chen San comes back in, followed by Mao Shi Di and a group of others. Pockmarked Chen San glances at them, and they walk in silently. The group gathers around the table and whispers together.</p>
<p>Auntie Dalai wants to find out about her son's recent activities. She deliberately walks past them, listening intently.</p>
<p>"Ah San, that young one is not bad, right? Her skin is so smooth," Mao Shi Di says to Pockmarked Chen San.</p>
<p>Pockmarked Chen San gives him a look, and the air immediately becomes silent again.</p>
<p>But the phrase "her skin is so smooth" rings especially loudly in Auntie Dalai's ears.</p>

<p>— Zhu Li</p>
<p>In the morning, newspapers spread out from Wangping Street, reaching every reader through every road and alley.</p>
<p>On the second page of the social news section was a two-column-long news item about a marital dispute: the protagonist was the daughter of Manager Lu of the Shanghai ×× Factory.</p>
<p>According to the newspaper's report: Miss Lu was a high-achieving student at the ×× Girls' School, excelling in both character and academics, and highly regarded by the school's teachers and elders. Eighteen years ago, she was betrothed in the womb to the son of a colleague of Manager Lu, surnamed Zhu. Now that the wedding date had arrived, Miss Lu opposed this arranged marriage and therefore disappeared, so the report stated.</p>
<p>This sensational news became the first topic of conversation among friends that afternoon, just like during the Shanghai war. In teahouses and taverns, there were even more irresponsible propagandists spreading outlandish rumors.</p>
<p>The next morning, an advertisement appeared: "All matters can be resolved. Please return quickly after seeing this..."</p>
<p>Within the ×× Girls' School and the ×× Factory, there were naturally even more discussions, as if everyone was completely clear about the case, and visitors during these two days put aside their personal matters to first discuss this "morphine needle" news.</p>
<p>Thus, several days later, many so-called 100% accurate insider stories about the case were gathered, making it impossible to figure out the truth.</p>
<p>Half a month later, everyone became indifferent to the case, or it was replaced by newer news.</p>
<p>Three months later, those who were once very confident in their views no longer mentioned the case.</p>
<p>A year later, it was as if the case had never happened, and everything was calm.</p>
<p>But our Miss Lu has safely returned.</p>
<p>"All matters have been resolved."</p>
<p>As Miss Lu pretended to be sorrowful and threw herself into her mother's arms, Manager Lu hurriedly took out the divorce agreement from the locked dressing table drawer, and, while maintaining his fatherly dignity, said:</p>
<p>"Now that things are settled! But a girl shouldn't be so willful. It doesn't sound good to others! You should also think about your father's current position!"</p>
<p>After speaking, he stroked the short mustache on his lip, feeling very satisfied with how the matter was handled.</p>
<p>"Alright, our daughter has already returned, what more is there to say!"</p>
<p>The wife, while patting her daughter's shoulder, blamed her husband; she naturally had her own womanly reasoning.</p>
<p>Because of their daughter's disappearance, the old couple had several arguments. Manager Lu believed that his daughter was too inconsiderate of his position and reputation, doing such a shameful thing. As a father, he had plenty of money and could fix anything, but now everyone knew about it, which was disgraceful! The wife, after all, loved her daughter dearly, and at the age of fifty, this was her only darling daughter. She was also dissatisfied with her daughter's marriage. Back when they arranged the marriage in the womb, everyone was poor, but now her husband was a manager, and she should marry a son-in-law who was her equal.</p>
<p>"Relying on half a son!" This was the wife's reasoning.</p>
<p>The manager, on the other hand, didn't think about these things. His daughter would always belong to someone else's family. If the son-in-law had no money, he could give him one or two hundred thousand, and he wouldn't have to worry about food for life. The father had plenty of money! His mistress had already given birth to a son, but he couldn't bring him back, and his daughter had to do such an unseemly thing!</p>
<p>They argued and quarreled every day, and only after making the mistress's matter public as a condition was the daughter's divorce settled.</p>
<p>"All matters have been resolved."</p>
<p>Miss Lu secretly told her mother that she was already "that," that the future son-in-law was coming tomorrow to discuss the marriage.</p>

<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>The city, the city at night, the dazzling lights shining everywhere, the brilliance of the dance hall entrance attracting the idle and happy people. Gentlemen and young masters, in groups, jump into the dark hall to enjoy themselves, to revel in the air filled with melodious music, the atmosphere filled with women's laughter. They revel, they enjoy, they forget all the world's troubles.</p>
<p>Accustomed to the luxurious life of the city, accustomed to seeing these things, gentlemen and young masters see it as a den of extravagance, but I am already tired of it, disgusted by it. Yet there are still some people, people who haven't entered the den, who want to enter in groups, envying others living this kind of life. Ah, the city, the city is a city that devours people's warmth and blood, chewing on people's skeletons! Those who are infatuated continue to be infatuated, those who are declining continue to decline, but behind them, groups of these infatuated chasers enter, everything is revolving.</p>
<p>Tonight, the wind on the road is exceptionally fierce. It is almost twelve o'clock. Several people, several young people who have already declined, are running on the silent winter night road, shaking their thin coats.</p>
<p>"Thirty days, a full thirty days without coming, it really feels like a different sentiment, doesn't it, old brother!"</p>
<p>The Annamese patrolman on Avenue Joffre stands lonely at the crossroads, his black teeth moving in his cold lips. On the road, that straight line of lights is shaking, and several dark shadows are moving quickly there. Indeed, in previous late nights, whether it was winter or summer, running on this road gave me only an ordinary feeling, but after a full thirty days of not seeing it, a full thirty days of being suffocated in that dim place, tonight, especially on such a calm late night, there is really a fresh feeling, especially since we are going to that place of intoxication.</p>
<p>On the road, the silent road, the wind is blowing, and the dark hands of demons are stretching in every corner. In the dark corners, there are trembling beggars fighting against the cold. In one or two of those cars, it is also dark, but what is broadcast from inside is the delicate and charming laughter of women. Apart from these two different sounds, there is only the sound of our shoes tapping on the pavement.</p>
<p>"Almost there, right? I really can't take it anymore, the alcohol is rising..."</p>
<p>Wang, immersed in half-drunkenness, seems to be talking to himself, running too strenuously, but as soon as he finished speaking, several people had already entered the realm of dim light, and the sound of music was ringing in their ears.</p>
<p>"You wouldn't think, right? Here tonight, wasn't it still in..."</p>
<p>Just as I settled down and my heart finally felt a moment of comfort, Chang patted my shoulder and said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Ha, maybe so! Life is just like this, the changes from morning to evening are uncertain, thirty days, maybe it's just a dream, tonight..."</p>
<p>Sounds that make people drunk and infatuated are surging on all sides, all the men, women, young, and old, are enjoying themselves in this intoxicating sound, jumping and dancing, wasting every second and moment of time. But I, everything only makes me tired, makes me lonely, every place in the world, I only feel the same weariness. Life, that dark, lonely, and depressing life, for me, only stretches on forever, until the moment when my body can no longer move.</p>

<p>I, a girl, grew up in Spring City. Life is difficult and full of hardships. I run around to find a job. Morning after morning, I sell newspapers, shouting loudly. Who responds at dawn? (Wangping Street) People rush to grab and compete, a chaotic mess. The most annoying are the trivial matters. I must be careful with the newspapers scattered on the ground. I rely on my quick feet to sort them out. I fold them high and low in my arms. The Shenbao and the Xinwenbao. They are popular everywhere and sell well. The Shibao Pictorial has been published for a long time. The scenes are colorful and strange. Last year, the Minbao was first published. Laws must be published to be effective. The Chenbao Children's Daily is loved by many readers. Leisurely education is a refreshing change. The Shishi Xinbao is known for its long history. The coverage is increased and the reporting is accurate. Jingangzuan, published every three days. Yao Dui Jingbao is the founder. The Great Shanghai, has a new editorial team. The interesting stories are critical and profound. (Innumerable) Small newspapers are strange and varied. They are nothing more than aids to conversation after drinking. All day I wander the main roads. My stomach is empty and I can barely afford a meal. As the sun sets, the crowds are dense. There is a shortage as people rush to buy newspapers. I sell them arbitrarily, regardless of the date. It doesn't matter if the old newspapers are sold as news. At night, I go in and out of shops. My delicate voice moves the listeners. Do you want some newspapers to pass the time? The price is five cents, very fair. There are always some frivolous women. They frequently wave me over. I was just beginning to understand love. I spent time with my sweetheart. I want to buy love newspapers. I don't care how expensive they are. Love is inherently empty. I advise everyone to be steadfast. Reading newspapers will help you understand the world. You will learn about current events and understand the situation. It is not right to be caught up in the extravagance.</p>

<h3 id="e311">"Blindness to Mount Tai" Movie Stars are Hard to Recognize <a href="#e311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>— Fine Stream</p>
<p>Do you think that you can always recognize your favorite movie stars at a glance? Well, think again.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a large group of deeply addicted movie fans went to Hollywood for a tour. A large company had provided them with a special guide! | As usual, a smooth-talking handsome young man | | was leading them, touring various parts of the company. Soon they arrived in front of a star's dressing room. There was a shiny black car parked there, and a chauffeur was sitting inside waiting. After a while, a woman strode past the large group of tourists, brushed past them, and jumped into the car and drove away. The large group of tourists didn't even give the woman in trousers and tousled hair a second look. Guess who she was? She was none other than the Swedish actress Greta Garbo, the one the star-hunting group wanted to capture and the fans most wanted to find! They watched her walk past with their eyes wide open. If they had recognized her, would she have been able to calmly get into the car and escape? What's most strange is that even the young guide from the company didn't recognize her. He later told people privately that he had been at the company for many years, but he had never seen Greta Garbo. But had he really not seen her? Or did he see her but not recognize her?</p>
<p>Therefore, I advise my friends not to casually bet that you can recognize movie stars at a glance, or that you can recognize Charlie Chaplin from afar as easily as a sailor recognizes a lighthouse. Once, a large circus troupe went to Hollywood, and Chaplin took his two children to see the circus. He and his two children sat together in the front row, eating peanuts and talking and laughing. He didn't wear his little mustache, nor did he wear a bowler hat, nor did he carry a small cane, nor did he wear broken boots and torn pants. He sat and watched the show peacefully, and no one in the audience recognized him. Who would have known that he was the comedian worshiped by millions?</p>
<p>Even in the famous restaurants of Hollywood, where you expect to see many stars, the stars might slip right under your nose without you even realizing it. One day, Sylvia Sidney wore dark glasses and sat in the company's restaurant for lunch. She sat for half a day without anyone recognizing her. Later, George Raft called out her name, and only then did people realize who she was. But after she was discovered, she immediately stood up and ran away. Garbo's clothes are also very ordinary, not attracting anyone's attention at all. Once, a naval officer went to a company to buy white canvas trousers. At the same time, a woman was also buying the same thing. The friend deliberately cut in front of the woman to buy them and deliberately took his time picking them out, making her wait a while longer. When he finished buying them and was about to leave, he realized that the woman was none other than the famous Greta Garbo. He had unintentionally made her wait for half a day.</p>
<p>Female stars are more difficult to recognize than male stars. It is said that the spots on a leopard will not change. But women are the best at changing. The Chinese say that a daughter changes eighteen times, and three more times before getting into the sedan chair. Now, Hollywood female stars only need to change their hairstyle, wear old clothes, and put on dark glasses, and you simply can't tell who they are. Moreover, there are so many people imitating each female star. They also wear old clothes and put on dark glasses, making it impossible for you to tell who is the real star and who is the fake star. When Anna Sten goes out, her face is covered in powder. Her hair is tousled, peeking out from under her small hat. When you see her, you just think she is a pretty female student from a nearby school. Mae West also doesn't wear diamonds. She wears long pants and a sweater. Who would know that she is the glamorous superstar who has caused a sensation across the country? Jean Harlow is especially difficult to recognize because there are too many people imitating her. Many extras who dress up as Jean Harlow look more like her than she does herself. And the number of platinum blonde women is increasing day by day, but there is only one real platinum blonde woman. Years ago, Gloria Swanson deliberately put on a set of old clothes, styled her hair differently, and went to several of her companies looking for work. She said her name was Rochelle Gray. She went to several companies, but none of them were willing to hire her. They all said she didn't look fashionable. At that time, Gloria was at the height of her popularity, but when she wore old clothes, no one recognized her.</p>
<p>In addition, a female star must have several doubles - people whose appearance is similar to the lead actor, used by the company to replace the star when necessary, and also to intimidate the star, so that she does not dare to be too stubborn. These doubles, walking on the street, are taken by autograph seekers as the real stars. When they see the real stars, they think they are fake.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e312">Review of "Flying Flower Village" <a href="#e312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He, Tang Na</p>
<p>"Flying Flower Village," as an exposé film, shows progress in the expression of the author of "Spring Tide." The distance between the love elegy of "Spring Tide" and the exposure of the darkness of society in "Flying Flower Village" is very far. Every petty-bourgeois author is often like this. He feels great interest in the sorrow and joy of love. But after the cruel reality constantly hits him, the pink dreams cannot but slowly disappear, and then he is forced to embark on a positive path. That is to say, he faces reality to a certain extent, and his work reflects dissatisfaction and anger with the current social situation.</p>
<p>Very clearly, in "Spring Tide," the author unfolded the disillusionment of love. Wang Renmei hoped to obtain perfect love (since the names of the characters in the play have been forgotten, the names of the actors will be used temporarily). Gao Zhanfei was also very passionate, but he could not withstand the attack of Li Li, the demon of lust, which destroyed their love, and their lives died with their love. So the author cried and sang, "Sweet dreams, come back!" But that dream will never return. The tragedy of love unfolds there, but it is only the tragedy of love, and it does not transcend the scope of love to exist as a positive reflection of social reality. However, the sweet dreams of love are indeed destroyed for the author. In the second work, "Flying Flower Village," he tossed away the illusions of love, and in the flower-selling voices of the village women, the ugliness of the stationmaster and other noble people was revealed. They were hungry for lust and privately trafficked in contraband. On the other hand, the flower-selling girls played by Hu Ping, when they still have to work hard to live, they have no possibility of working, and they cannot live except by selling their bodies, let alone relieve the poverty of their husbands and daughters. The adoption of such a theme and the determination of the theme do have some positive progress compared to "Spring Tide."</p>
<p>However, the author is still very interested in women, in so-called love and desire, so he decided that Hu Ping should take flower-selling as a profession, and flowers and women are always reluctant to separate. Similarly, a lot of film was spent on the scenery of the salted meat shop.... These and everything in "Spring Tide" are still very similar. Of course, we are not saying that this kind of material cannot be adopted, but we are using this to illustrate the author's style and tendency.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the author likes tragic creations very much. "Spring Tide" is certainly a tragedy, and in the development of the story of "Flying Flower Village," Hu Ping and Gao Zhanfei may not be able to achieve a relatively complete ending, but he always kills her to complete his tragic ending.</p>
<p>Now, let's see how he expresses it. Like many Chinese works, he adopts a slow TEMPO to express the living habits of Chinese people. However, as a cinematic expression, in the rural and relatively peaceful environment, this slow TEMPO can be applied, but when expressing the city, it feels that a high-speed expression of chaos and annoyance is more appropriate. And the high-speed strengthening of character dynamics is the most cutting-edge expression of the 1930s. From this point of view, the speed of "Flying Flower Village" in the second half is too slow. The most obvious example is when Hu... the police caught Wang Naidong and walked into the courtroom, she did not run at speed, and the slowness of the whole tone is needless to say. Fortunately, the dubbing helped a lot, but it didn't become tense after all.</p>
<p>Secondly, what should be said is that the MONTAGE is not smooth enough. For example, when Gao Zhanfei fought in the train, he was not seen falling on the ground, and then he was connected to the hospital. Also, for example, when Gao Zhanfei hit Hu Ping, people suddenly watched outside the window, which was an improper cut, resulting in a loss of air and insufficient grasp. The parallel development of the other three lines feels chaotic, especially Hu Ping's arrival in the city is described in detail, while Gao Zhanfei's arrival in the city is lightly let go, which shows the author's one-sided concept.</p>
<p>Of course, although there are these shortcomings, they cannot hide the author's efforts. For example, the air of Hanzhuang and the grasp of the personality of the characters in the play have achieved very good results. At the same time, Hu Ping, Gao Zhanfei, Ye Juanjuan, and Wang Naidong are all very good actors. Especially Wang Naidong's calm and experienced acting skills are even more surprising. And Ye Juanjuan, who has never been valued by people, has also achieved very good results here due to the good guidance of the director.</p>
<p>In addition, the efforts of photography and set design have made this film achieve a lot of success. This can also prove that Chinese films are indeed constantly improving in technology. At the end of this 1934, we have high expectations for 1935 due to this film.</p>
<h3 id="e313">Review of "Affairs of Voltaire" <a href="#e313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>The Affairs of Voltaire</p>
<p>- Cathay Release -</p>
<p>Regarding Voltaire, the master of art and literary giant of 18th-century France, I would like to briefly use the following words to explain:</p>
<p>"...Voltaire's philosophical point of view is based on Locke's theory of sensation... It did not have much influence on the development of 18th-century materialism. However, his attacks on Catholicism and court learning, his books of criticism and satire, have special significance. These not only opened up a road for French atheism in the 18th century, but also made great contributions to the revolution. However, he was a "salon" atheist, because he also believed that religion was necessary for the foolish people, it could restrain the barbarous desires of the people, and maintaining the domination of the enlightened old people over the foolish people was a powerful religion. This point shows that his ideo-Voroky is bourgeois aristocratic liberalism."</p>
<p>Voltaire in "Affairs of Voltaire" shown on the screen is a progressive writer with a sense of justice. He cannot stand the absurdity of the Louis XV dynasty and the tyranny of Finance Minister Count Sarnap and others. In the cries and struggles of people starving to death, he sacrificed his weak body for humanity, justice, and freedom, and resolutely wrote pamphlets to shout for the innocent people and write plays exposing the pain of the people and the power of the powerful. He is not afraid of offending the emperor and sycophants. He also did not hesitate to enter hell - the most famous Bastille prison - to spend the darkest and most glorious life with the general enlightened people of the time. However, justice is justice after all, and history, which will not flow backwards, has made the fairest judge. The books that were burned and the bronze statues that were destroyed will eventually be supported and offered by masses of people shouting "bread," "justice," and "freedom."</p>
<p>A slight deficiency is due to the way the playwright handles this great material. He was too concerned about the story of the play's progress, and wrote the queen's respect and belief in Voltaire too mythically. Voltaire's attitude towards Louis and Sarnap was written with a sense of justice greater than the skill of the police, which made us feel like we were seeing the struggle between昏君,奸臣 and loyal and upright prime ministers or censors in Chinese dramas.</p>
<p>Director George Arlen and George Arliss, who played Voltaire, both had great success. The others who played the king, queen, Sarnap, and Miss Nanga did not fail the name of Voltaire. The alertness of the dialogue, the tightness of the weaving, the light photography and sound effects, and the acting skills of each person, etc., unfortunately, this article is limited in length and cannot be described in detail.</p>

<p>— Su Hua</p>
<p>Sulia lifted a corner of her veil and peeked at Donal from the small window on the stairs, blowing his mouth happily on the path. Only after he jumped over the wall did she lazily stroll back to the bedroom. She changed. She put on her pajamas, walked close to the window facing the garden, and sang softly. At first she just sang softly, but later she couldn't help but sing loudly. Suddenly there was singing outside the garden wall, a man's voice, undoubtedly Donal's.</p>
<p>When the singing stopped, Sulia turned back. She lay on the bed for a while and then said to the maid: "Ask the secretary to find me the address of a person named Donal." But the three maids told her in unison that he lived upstairs at 52 Queen's Road. Sulia blushed and said, "Thank you, that's okay, there's nothing now." The maids said good night to her and went out. Fortunately, she couldn't sleep back and forth on the bed, so she put on her pajamas and got up to open her diary and write urgently. Soon, she finished writing and said happily: "I have written it all out, it will not exist in my heart. I will forget it soon."</p>
<p>The lovely sunshine and warm breeze seemed to keep the things of last night, making Sulia unable to forget. She hoped the days would pass quickly. It was again when the moon was on the willow tips, and she strolled out to the garden again. Sitting on the stone bench, waiting unconsciously. An hour and two hours passed. She walked back dejectedly. She lay on the bed for a while and then went to write her diary. She wrote: "I have forgotten him."</p>
<p>Another day has passed! The moon is still unharmed at night, the garden is still as quiet, and she writes her diary as before before going to bed. But the next day, Sulia was a little different. Thousands of thoughts rushed into her mind aimlessly. She closed all the windows, isolating all happy stimuli. Widowhood and veils can eliminate the entire youth, and the melancholy mood filled her entire soul. The moving songs sung by those soldiers seemed to deliberately penetrate her eardrums through the window gaps. She couldn't bear it anymore. She stood up and pulled the maid's calling cord, hurriedly took out Donal's letter from the drawer and burned it in hatred. She knew, because she knew that all the miserable life could be turned into nothing at the same time as this letter. When the maid came in, all the black clothes were torn to pieces by her. She also shouted in her mouth: "Hurry up and bring me all my new clothes and new things, we will go to Paris tomorrow!"</p>
<p>Sulia's arrival in Paris gave the country of Masovia a great panic. There were constant inquiries about Sulia's actions in Paris. It was said that a certain duke was engaged to her, and it was said that a certain prince was proposing to her. Undoubtedly, Sulia is now a merry widow. The people of Masovia were panicking every day, afraid that she would marry in Paris. Once she gets married, her property in Masovia will not necessarily go with her, and Masovia will go bankrupt. At that time, King Yami wanted to hold a cabinet meeting for this matter, wanting to select a handsome and gentle secret envoy to go to Paris to please the merry widow so that she would not marry a foreigner. Coincidentally, Queen Dorothy and Royal Guard Captain Donal were having a secret meeting at this time, and King Yami caught them. In addition to anger, the king came up with a plan and sent Donal to Paris to meet Ambassador Baff, temporarily acting as the secret envoy of Masovia. As soon as Donal arrived in Paris, his luggage had not been sorted out in the hotel, so he shouted to wear a dress and go to the Maxi dance floor, without even seeing the ambassador. He arrived at Maxi and quarreled with a woman because he kissed a woman, not wanting that person to be Ambassador Baff. Later, the ambassador found out and pulled him into a quiet room and said to him: "This is an important national secret. Give her a dance party at the embassy tomorrow night." Donal deliberately asked: "Is she beautiful?" The ambassador replied: "For her property, she must be beautiful, but whether you like her or not, you must love her. Come to the embassy tomorrow night and I will introduce you to her. Do you think this is a good idea?" Donal excitedly agreed and ran out. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e316">Proclamation of Liquidation of French Automobile Giant Citroen <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>— Stagnant</p>
<p>Amid the sounds of recession, British and American automobile factories are expressing that the automobile business in 1934 has entered the path of recovery. However, we cannot deny that the impact of the recession has not been completely restored. Therefore, in the automobile industry in the United Kingdom and the United States, there are indeed many people who can support the facade, and there are also many people who have declared liquidation or mutual merger due to poor turnover. The French automobile business is inherently more backward than the British and American ones, and Citroen is the giant among the domestic automobile factories. However, in the turbulent world of economic recession, this French automobile giant Citroen factory has been heard of for liquidation. It can be seen that the economic crisis is getting worse and worse.</p>
<p>Since the news of the Citroen factory's liquidation was announced, the factory owner Citroen has visited French Prime Minister Florentin to personally present the factory's economic difficulties. At first, the government intended to provide assistance to prevent it from going bankrupt. Citroen factory is a relatively large car factory in France, and it employs a lot of workers. If it goes bankrupt, it will add a batch of unemployed people to France. However, as a result, some members of the council expressed opposition to using government public funds to support private businesses. Therefore, the so-called assistance has become empty talk, and the Citroen factory may be liquidated.</p>
<p>In recent years, the cars produced by Citroen factory have also been improving day by day. And because the French environment is trending towards luxury, Citroen cars are particularly exquisite in the manufacturing of the body. It is said that the 1934 Citroen cars have as many as ninety kinds of body styles. Citroen cars sold in various places are mostly 10 horsepower, large 12 horsepower, and 12 horsepower. In the past year, more than 60,000 of the above three types of vehicles have been sold in various places. Car owners in various places have expressed satisfaction after driving Citroen cars.</p>
<p>In the history of Citroen, the first prize trophies won in exhibitions held in various places have totaled eighteen times. As for the automobile races held in various parts of France, Citroen has also created many top records. Even in international automobile races, according to the official report of the French Automobile Association, Citroen four-cylinder and six-cylinder cars have created 134 French records and 241 world records in France and internationally. The performance of Citroen cars can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Taking the 1934 light 12-horsepower Citroen new car as an example, the maximum speed can reach 68 miles per hour. And it can accelerate from 8 miles per hour to 50 miles per hour in 36 seconds. The rich acceleration is also unmatched by general cars. Acceleration is convenient and easy, and the speed is extremely high. Therefore, car owners who like fast cars buy Citroen cars. The powerful traffic jam, the beautiful appearance, and the heavy chassis are all special advantages of Citroen. Therefore, after the 1934 Citroen new car was launched, it became popular in various places and was welcomed by car owners. Now, this French factory is heard of for liquidation. If it becomes a reality, it will be a great loss to the future of the French automobile industry.</p>

<p>The Berlin Auto Show Date is Set. In major cities throughout Europe and America, auto shows are often held at the end of the year and the beginning of the new year. The latest car models are displayed in categories, making it convenient for the public to compare and choose. This excellent practice is also an annual social event. It's like New York in America, London in England, and Paris in France; which one doesn't have an auto show? When the time comes, everyone goes out, creating a feeling of city-wide excitement. The Berlin Auto Show in Germany has now been decided to be held next year. The date has also been chosen, from February 14th to 24th, 1935. The exhibition will last for a total of ten days. In previous years, the Berlin Auto Show venue occupied two large halls. Next year, due to the increase in participating car dealers, the location will also need to be expanded. All halls connected to the large exhibition venue will be used. These halls are connected to the main road through intermediate roads and old halls. It is said that this location is very suitable for vehicle exhibitions. Next year's venue layout will be the same as in previous years. Various types of cars and parts will be divided into several major sections. Therefore, private passenger cars and commercial freight vehicles will be displayed in two separate locations.</p>
<p>London-India Automobile Trip. Recently, Colonel Caillet and his wife, along with two friends, made a long-distance automobile trip between London and India. According to the latest news, their journey is progressing very smoothly. They are using two 27-horsepower Hillman touring cars as their means of transportation. They have now crossed Jerusalem and reached a location near Baghdad. According to their travel diaries, the journey from London to Jerusalem covers a total of 3,423 miles. Their average driving speed is 23 miles per hour. Many places along this route have extremely dry and dusty roads, making it quite difficult to drive. Therefore, under such circumstances, it is not an easy feat for these two Hillman cars to achieve this result.</p>
<p>Innovation at the British Ford Factory. Ford's new-style luxury cars have ample power, beautiful designs, and moderate prices, resulting in supply falling short of demand and a high level of demand. In order to meet the needs and mass production, the Ford factory in Dagenham, England, has specifically renovated and innovated its original car manufacturing plant. In two weeks, the original machinery in the factory, weighing 1,200 pounds, has been disassembled and reassembled. Also, the monorail transport vehicle, which is three-quarters of a mile long, has also been renovated to meet the new production plan. The total investment of the American Ford Company for the new plan in 1935 amounts to £83,000,000. It is estimated that 1,000,000 new cars will be produced in this year.</p>
<p>Goodyear's Java Branch. The American Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company is planning to establish a branch in Buitenzorg, Java. The estimated daily production capacity is 300 rubber outer tires and inner tubes each. The opening date is scheduled for May 1, 1935. At that time, approximately 200 workers will be employed. The factory site is approximately 460 feet long and 200 feet wide, mostly open-style. The building materials are entirely steel, which is most suitable for tropical mechanical factories. The raw material storage room and drying room are all built indoors with windows. The engine and furnace room are separated from most of the factory buildings for safety reasons. The factory site is located on a 28-acre rubber plantation, surrounded by six new-style houses for engineers and management personnel to live in. This Java branch is Goodyear's fifth foreign branch. Their locations are in Canada, England, Australia, and Argentina. As for the original factories, they are in Akron, Ohio, Los Angeles, and Gadsden, Alabama. The head of the Java branch is Mr. Hartley, who has been in the Far East for many years and has abundant experience.</p>
<p>The Sound Suppression Movement Craze in England. The issue of sound suppression is receiving great attention throughout England, especially in bustling cities and metropolises. Local people are making great efforts to maintain public tranquility and are thoroughly seeking a fundamental solution to this issue. The beginning of this matter was initiated by Mr. Hore-Belisha, the Minister of Transport of the British government. There is also a committee, chaired by Sir Henry Fowler, whose members include scientists and manufacturers of automobiles and motorcycles. Their sole objective is to consider and investigate how mechanically propelled vehicles generate unpleasant noise and what methods can be used to eliminate or reduce the production of such noise. On the part of automobile manufacturers, they have spent a lot of effort researching the reduction of automobile noise in recent years. However, there are still many areas to be improved. Recently, it has been learned that the Broadspeed Company in Slough has put a lot of effort into experimenting with sound suppression methods. They are now studying whether asbestos can reduce automobile noise. Asbestos has fireproof and soundproof properties, so it is widely used in modern building construction. Some people advocate using asbestos as a lining for car hoods, especially for old cars. The reason is that the older the car, the louder the noise. If asbestos is used as a lining, then at the very least, it can confine the sound within the hood and prevent it from spreading out.</p>
<p>Pikes Peak Hill Climb Record. The Pikes Peak Hill Climb competition near Colorado Springs, USA, is held annually. Driving in such a venue is indeed a very difficult task. Even without mentioning the record time, just getting the car to ascend to the summit is not an easy task. Circumventing high mountain paths and not facing thousand-foot abysses are all chilling experiences. This year's 16th annual competition was held on American Labor Day. The number of spectators caused traffic congestion. In the open car group, Louis Unser took the top spot with 16 seconds and 18 tenths of a second. He was driving a Green-Goetz Stutz car, surpassing the old championship by nearly a minute. Three Ford V-8 stock cars broke the original stock car record, with Harmon's car having the shortest time, only 19 minutes, 25 and 7 tenths of a second. These drivers were able to achieve such amazing results undoubtedly because of their driving skills and the engine power of the cars. However, one thing that is also worth our attention is that all cars in the open car and stock car groups used Champion spark plugs, which were very effective.</p>
<p>Studebaker Armored Car. At the beginning of last month, the Studebaker factory in South Bend, Indiana, manufactured a fully armored car. This car is a special-made President Eight sedan, prepared for use by the police department. The biggest feature of this car is that it is completely bulletproof. Except for bullets that can penetrate the car from the floor, bullets cannot penetrate from any other direction, such as the roof, front, and sides of the car. This is because the car body is surrounded by bulletproof steel. The windows are made of one-inch-thick bulletproof glass. The windshield also has bulletproof capabilities. As for the four gun ports, they can be closed automatically and are made with rubber clips to prevent the danger of shattering the glass with recoil. The wheels are also protected by bulletproof steel wire in front. The radiator is similarly protected by steel wire, so there is no room for error.</p>
