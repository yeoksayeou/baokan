<p>倫敦商相任錫曼今日在下院答關於英日條約訽問、聲稱　、覺英政府儘可採充分計畫、以保護其商務利益、而無須取銷商約、故現未有取銷商約之意、就英國市塲而言、英政府覺絲稅事不能展緩考慮、財相張伯倫已囑進口稅則顧問委員會儘速對於此事繕具詳細報告、殖民部大臣李斯特已商請殖民地與保護地政府擬採行適當方法、並將請各殖民地除西非外採用進口限額辦法、適用於各國輸入之棉貨與人造絲貨、以期恢復英國在棉貨與人造絲貨上固有之地位、所擬限額、將以一九二七年至一九三一年每年平均輸入數量爲根據、英政府並提議在殖民地趕速成立必要立法案、爲阻止預先輸入以圖厚利起見、此項立法案雖成立於日後、但其有效日期則追從今日爲始、英政府昨已通告取銷適用於西非之英日商約、英國舉動將以對於日貨爲限、目前渠未籌議處置除棉貨與人造絲貨外之其他貨物、英政府深知日方競爭不僅限於此種紡織物、故將考慮其他有關係實業之事件及殖民地市塲稅則行爲之需要、至於國内市塲、則此事亦可根據進口稅法所載之尋常手續應付之、英政府不能再延不設法以保障其商業利益云、商相末稱、吾人當然隨時準備對於政府所欲提出之任何提議志在以相互恊定解决相互問題之困難者予以審愼之考慮云、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦財相張伯倫今日告知下院、謂已請入口稅顧問委員會從速重行工作、修正絲與人造絲入口稅率、而提出相當之條陳云、此爲徵實商相任錫曼昨日發表之言（八日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c2">日貨大受打擊　棉貨與人造絲貨减少三分之二强 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>倫敦商相任錫曼在下院宣佈對於日貨競爭之新計劃、其實際影響、爲除東非有特殊條約義務外、其他殖民地市場、日本棉貨與人造絲貨之輸入將减少三分之二强、查日本棉布輸入英屬殖民地、（東非除外）之每年平均數量、在一九二七年至一九三一年之五年中、各爲五四·四○二·○○○碼、查一九三二年日貨輸入額增至一四六·五六四·○○○碼、一九三三年視此尤多、而今年輸入則猶有增無减、英倫國内市塲之行爲、將繋於進口稅顧問委員會對於絲稅之研究結果、而英國各實業受日本過分競爭之害者、亦將對此顧問委員會有所請求、故國内市塲之行爲、亦將視各實業之請求而定也、以絲貨輸入英國者、除日本外、尙有法意兩國、故此事未可對於日本獨加歧視、英政府固可考慮在其殖民地市塲應如何調節稅則、以限制除棉貨與人造絲貨外之日貨、但在國内市塲、則稅則行爲必須由稅則顧問委員會主持、非政府所能獨斷獨行也、查一九三三年日貨輸入英國者、共値七·二二七·○○○鎊、而英貨對日輸出、則僅四·四三七·○○○鎊、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦貿易大臣任錫曼、頃在下院宣佈政府防止日貨傾銷之政策、大旨謂自五月七日起英國各殖民地將限制棉織物及人造絲之進口數額、以免日貨之傾銷、在英國本國則將修正生絲進口稅則、至於英日條約、則英國並不宣告廢棄云、任錫曼又謂、「政府一方面雖希望與日本成立恊定、但爲保護英國貿易所必需之行動、已不能再行延緩、因此吾人已於上星期四日通知日本駐英松平大使、謂英國認爲對於保障其商業利益所不可缺之措置、政府此後將有其自由採行之權、至關於英日商約、則吾人確信可在不廢棄商約之範圍内採取爲保護吾國利益所必需之各項措置吾人業已通知日本大使、謂吾人認爲英日商約毫無廢棄之理由、就英國市塲而論、吾人以爲修改生絲稅則一事、斷難再行延緩、財政大臣頃已命稅則委員會、儘速完成關於修改生絲稅則問題之報告書、至於傾銷問題、則可用修改進口稅之通常程序、加以解决、吾人業已通知日本大使、謂英國殖民大臣已與各殖民地政府磋商、各殖民地政府咸認有保護行動之必要、將一律實行限制進口數額辦法除西菲洲殖民地外、此項限制進口辦法、對於由外國輸入之棉織物及人造絲、一律適用之、此種措置、其目的在使英國恢復其平常貿易時代在此等殖民地市塲原有之位置、限制進口之數額、以一九二七至一九三一年五年中、每年進口之平均數爲根據、自五月月七日起卽行實施、惟西菲洲殖民地、則在一年前業已通知廢棄英日商約、因此該地作爲特殊情形、對於限制進口數額、得僅以日本輸出品爲限云、任錫曼結論、則謂日貨競爭、不僅限於紡織品、此節政府亦曾慮及、對於其他各種商貨、保護殖民地市塲所必需之行動、則政府尙在研究中、要之吾人採取保障貿易利益之措置、已不容再行遲延、但日本政府如提出各項足以解决此種困難問題之辦法、則吾人仍當虚必加以研究」云、任錫曼發表宣言後、全塲鼓掌表示贊成、有若干議員、訽以是否將與各自治領聯合行動、任錫曼答謂、各自治領業已接得關於此項决定之通知、但英國不能干預各自治領之内政、如自治領政府有所行動、則係出於自願行動、而非出於英政府之要求也云云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（東京）英國商相任錫曼在議會關於日本商品輸入英殖民地之聲明、日外務省尙未接公電、但外務當局之觀察如下、（一）三日之覺書内有「哥洛尼阿爾恩派亞」字句、因意味不明、目下電松平大使、照會英外務省、若日英折衝基礎未經確定、一面聲明要求卽時實施限制輸入、實頗不解、（二）據報殖民地中之香港·錫蘭等均表示反對、卽使實施、未必立卽影響日本貿易、今後若英方違反最惠國條欵、圖損害日本貿易、則凖備抗議或促加反省、（三）自去年四月突然通告取消西阿菲利加之通商條約以來、對於多年友邦之日本、取壓迫通商之政策致令日本頗不愉快、且不得不道德的非難、（八日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）今日路透社記者走訪日外務省某高級人員、據稱、英商相相任錫曼之宣言、實與英國自由貿易之原則大相背馳、據渠之意見、限額制實違反條約最惠國待遇之規定、又稱、日政府現保持沉默態度、但將依據英日傳統的友交之原則、謀與英國復相和諧、以保護其條約利益、日本可隨時自由採取報復手段、但用此案殊爲複雜、且須嚴重考慮與其他國家貿易關係上將發生若何反響、故目前對於報復尙未有任何决定云、後記者叩以日本對英各自治地應視爲任錫曼限額辦法中之一方面、抑爲各别之整體、據該員答稱、日政府現正審愼研究此問題、在决定對英國各自治地政策前、第一步須視英各屬地所施限額制有何影響云、（八日路透電）</p>

<p>（東京）昨日英商相任錫曼在下院宣稱、英政府覺有自由可取所以爲合宜之行動、以保障英國之商業利益、而抵制日貨之競爭、此言實非此間所能料及及、惟日本現以非常鎭靜之態度接受之、大約因宣言之内容、益使日人確信欲自熱帶市塲排除日貨、實多困難、蓋其地土人購買力低微、皆願購用廉價之日貨也、同時覺英政府當知欲定一額限可適合殖民地之狀况而爲其地議會與商人所接受者、尤其在香港與馬來二地、實爲不易着手之大問題、再、日本在英殖民地之商業、其數量雖屬重要、但料英國實施限額後、所減不致巨大、且可以日本在南美與滿洲等處所推銷之貨、彌補其失、日本之抨詆、多謂英國現圖倫敦英日紡織業會議破裂、致不能籌定一可實行的計畫、歸咎於日本、英國現恫嚇日本、以期日本製成一具體方案、而可由兩國相互接受、朝日新聞謂任錫曼致倫敦英大使之覺書、對於蘭開夏提出之建議、並未置議、故不能以之爲共同正式會議之基礎、日政府不欲提出任何對案、如英國果限制日貨入口、則日本或將實施商業保障案、而使政府得調節其輸入與輸出、並修訂稅率、該案如果實施、日本可對英國製造徵收最高之稅云、日本商界與報紙現益注重日本與荷屬東印度之談判、查上年日本輸往荷屬東印度之商品、共値日金一萬五千萬元、如在六月四日開始之巴達維亞會議中不能商定滿意的相互買賣方案、則此路貿易將陷危境也、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）今晨各報除朝日新聞外均未評論英商相昨日在下院所發對於日本與美屬各地貿易之演詞、朝日新聞預料日政府將採取靜觀政策、同時深信英帝國及各屬地所施之限額政策、不致嚴重損害日本之貿易、並預料日本將被逼對澳洲及加拿大施行抵制行動云、今日外務省發言人拒絕評論此事、因尙未接得駐英日大使松平之報告、僅稱英商相任錫曼之宣言並非出於意外而已（八日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c5">英報一致贊許　不卑不亢恰如人望　仍主保持英日關係 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>（倫敦）貿易大臣倫西曼、昨日在下院發表宣言、陳述政府抵制日貨傾銷之政策、今晨各報對稚此項宣言、均表示熱烈之贊許、對於政府所採取之决定、一致稱揚、以爲既和婉而又堅决、如泰晤士報評論、謂曩者各方面作種種努力、謀使日本工業界一旦覺悟、緩和其擾亂世界市塲之政策、此種努力、現已歸於失敗、政府深明大勢、故採迅速之措置、以限制進口數額之方法、遏抑日貨之競爭、且其步驟不卑不亢、恰如人望、其中惟西菲洲殖民地、則作爲例外、蓋在西菲洲、英日商約、已失其時效、故對日貨單獨加以限制、不至損及最惠國條欵也、至於此外各地、對於由外國進口之棉織品及人造絲、一律適用同樣之進口限額、並無軒褪云、最後泰晤士報、並希望各自治領、爲顧全帝國共同利益起見、各自採取認爲適宜之手段、以步武母國政府之後塵云、此外有足注意者、則英國若干温和分子、仍主張保持英日兩國間之誠信關係、雖目前與工業界最有利害關係者、均要求採取關稅報復手段、但温和派則仍以爲不宜鹵莽從事、致爲損兩國邦交、例如最近英國成立英日關係委員會、以自由黨下議員柏克林爲主席、該委員會之目的、卽在設法「避免關稅報復手段、以免英帝國受其禍患、」因此若干温和份子對於此次政府之决定、並未全部一致表示滿意、就「晨報」論調觀之、多數保守黨員、始終相信英國紡織工業生產過剩之危機、不能僅在英帝國國境内加以消納、至於自由黨與工黨對於日貨傾銷及日本工資低廉之二事、雖素來排斥最烈、然一切關稅戰爭之原則、則概爲彼輩之所反對、例如工黨機關報「每日民聲報」謂、縱令限制進口數額之政策完全成功、英國工業所得之利益、</p>
<p>殆亦如水花泡影而已、蓋日本如在英國殖民地市塲受種種限制、則惟有轉向其他中立市塲、加緊發展、此種市塲、對於英國工業、關係實尤爲重大也、總之解决國際貿易戰爭問題、惟由世界經濟會議提出適當之措置、方爲唯一良策云云、</p>
<p>（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦每日電聞今日論應付英帝國市塲中日貨競爭之計畫、謂日本仍處於良好地位、與其在尋常狀况下從事競爭時初無稍異、英政府已表示極大之忍耐、並以友好精神行事、其所採之計畫、當可使貿易恢復至可爲一般恊定的基礎之點日本乃英帝國之良好主顧、英國亟願保持此種關係、但不願將英國所造成市塲奉送日本、以爲代價耳云、每日驛報則謂商相任錫曼現玩火自焚、日本將在更重要中立市塲中競爭愈烈、而英國實業所冀獲之利益、恐終成泡影云、晨郵報謂英政府所加之限額、可切實制止日本商業膨脹、但最後解决不能僅求之於英殖民地云、泰晤士報稱、英政府不得已在業已紛擾不寗之世界中提出繼續限制貿易之辦法、此爲英國多數人民所爲扼者腕者、惟英政府舍此無他道也、政府已竭其力冀促成友好的折衷辦法、但所謀不遂、乃不得不急定限制政策、然此政策猶出以爲人所期望之温和、英政府今不過效印政府之所爲耳、日本固已自願接受印度之限制、使日貨輸入額之削减甚於英國新限額也、英國限制計畫、復將推及於棉布與人造絲貨外之其他日貨、但商相已以極鄭重之詞向日本申述英國亟願在限制問題上成立相互恊定之意矣、希望日本實業家不忘英日棉業會議决裂之敎訓云、孟却斯德指導報今日指商相任錫曼之言論爲英國在其保護主義派事業中所行最重大步驟之一、並謂觀商相之言、商相顯然用限額辦法爲打擊日本之巨棒、商相既以若干年爲其限額時期、而復宣佈談判之門迄未關閉、惟察日本政策之近來趨向、無敢謂此舉可使日人有動於中也云、金融時報稱、東京方面迄未提出具體方案、則英國之毅然决定限額辦法、固其宜也云、金融新聞亦著批評、希望商相所發不以不友好精神施行限額辦法之說、始終不渝、蓋外國與印度仍爲蘭開夏棉貨之最重要商場、若限額辦法行之過急、恐徒加重日貨競爭也、（八日路透電）</p>

<p>— 元</p>
<p>秦理齋夫人龔尹霞女士與其子女合門仰藥之事。吾人一方面愴痛已故同事之家庭演此慘劇。不能不灑同情之淚。一方面則於此對社會富有暗示力與刺戟性之自殺事件。更不能不分析之。闡述之。以求其不致予社會以不良之影響。苛論固不忍爲。原情亦有分際。執筆躊躇。其困難當爲讀者所共諒也。</p>
<p>自殺之舉。有因於情感之衝動者。有因於經濟之困難者。有因於生活環境之壓迫者。讀龔女士遣書。雖多悲痛之語。然其「日夕祈禱能不演此慘劇。」</p>
<p>「欲自殺而又止者已十餘次。」非純由於情感之衝動可知。其經濟問題。亦自謂「暫可解决」則此次决行合門仰藥同殉之主因。其在於生活環境之壓迫乎。觀秦平甫致媳書。以迷信之乩語。嚴重之禮敎。迫龔回無錫合居。而龏氏遣書。有「理齋君乎。君有所求。胡不告我而以告他人。且謂我宜居錫。若果是何居心」之痛言。此中衝突。不言可知矣。</p>
<p>吾人認識中之龔女士。一受舊禮敎陶冶甚深之賢婦佳女也。然其十餘年之生活。則又爲現代以精神方面的成分維持一夫一妻制之新式家庭生活。其生活。習慣與思想。既已矛盾衝突如此。故其因不忍摧毁現有之新式家庭生活而慟念亡夫。因不能反抗禮敎之壓迫而極感苦惱乃爲應有之事。結事。遂不得不出於一死。鳴呼。若龔女士者。一現時代新舊衝突中之犧牲者而已。　　自殺之事。法律上認爲犯罪。社會習慣上認爲不祥。然在社會學上。則諸家學說不同。有歸過於個人者。亦有歸過於社會者。龔女士之自殺。個人之過耶。抑社會之過耶。誠一値得討論之問題也。</p>
<p>吾人最後不得不藉此以正告與龔女士生活環境相類之讀者。曰在新舊衝突之時代。感受苦惱者之惟一出路。爲努力奮鬥。堅强其意志振奮其精神。與環境相抵抗。乃爲適宜之生活方針。自殺則縱有同情。而决不可爲訓。</p>
<p>余與秦君理齋共事十二年交誼甚篤。與乃翁平甫少年同學。又曾同事。頗悉其父子雖富於新學識。而皆不能放棄舊道德觀念者。理齋夫人龔氏。出自望族。當然飽受舊禮敎敎訓。然不幸身當現社會矛盾衝突之衝。困難交逼。惶恐徘徊而無術以自衝破。而竟演此慘劇也。理齋終七後龔夫人挈二子來館。謝同人弔唁意。並向余與伍君特公商二子學業問。</p>
<p>題自身職業問題及此後維持家庭方法。言雖悲苦固未見其有死志也。余告以無論遇何爲難事。可來與余商。諾而去。其躊躇既久而終於决定之死志。竟不能使余有慰勸之機會。則余之憾事也嗚呼死者已矣此一問題。非秦氏一家一問題。其影響實及於全社會。故特忍痛一論之。</p>

<p>（蘭州）蘭州各界五日晨開歡迎宋子文大會、宋氏之演詞如下、主席各位兄弟今天得在蘭州同甘肅各界同胞會見、覺得非常的愉快、剛在聽見主席的歡迎詞、對兄弟過分的嘉奬、在十分感謝之中、尤覺得十分的慚愧、兄弟在兩星期前由首都進潼關、在陜西各方面所看見的所聽得的、都極滿意、因爲物質上雖然貧窮、但是人民精神極爲奮發、與前幾年大不相同、人人都有朝氣、亦如充滿復興希望、不是十八十九兩年坐以待斃的氣象了、現在鄙人到了甘肅所看見的一切、對於整個西北、腦海中有同樣的感想、認爲西北前途、是極有光明的、外省人士到西北來視察、大概有兩種的觀感、一種是極力的頌揚西北文化的深厚、是用文學家或詩人的眼光來觀看西北、一種是滿口批評西北生產如何落後、敎育如何不振、人民如何貧苦、是用外國人的眼光來觀看西北、兄弟以爲這兩種態度都是偏見的不合的、西北從前繁盛光榮的歷史、是我們大家的祖宗所努力的功效、我們不能專事追念祖宗的功績、正要慚愧子孫的無用、追想過去而忘記現在、及今後繼續我祖宗的努力、同時要知道我們整個的中國是落後的國家、東南各省雖較西北各省有進步、但仍是不能如列强之天天邁進、而且東南各省現在物質的進步、並不是東南人民比較西北人民格外的聰明或努力、完全是靠東南的地理優勢、因爲沿海各省交通便利、能够有吸收歐西經濟及科學的力量、西北各省如果能同樣利用歐西及東南的經濟和科學的力量、一定能够在短時期内恢復地方的繁榮、鞏固國家的基礎、西北的建設、不是一個地方問題、是整個國家的問題、現在沿江沿海各省、已經在侵略者砲火之下、我們</p>
<p>應當在中華民族發源地的西北趕快注重建設、歐戰以後士耳其、在極危險的時候、就將國都由繁盛的康斯旦丁堡遷到土耳其民族發源地的安格拉、我國在危極存亡之秋、亦應同樣注重在我國民族發源地的西北内地謀建設、中央對於西北建設是十分的重視、蔣委員長汪院長因軍事政事不能分身、所以兄弟受經濟委員會的使命、代表全體常務委員、來到</p>
<p>西北視察、西北建設、是極大的題目、應該辦的事很多、經濟委員會苦於力量有限、祗能選急切的基本工作、一步一步做去、我們所計劃的、第一是與東南交通的道路、在隴海鐵路尙未修通以前、先把公路修好、將運輸方法計劃完善、能把東南的經濟力量和歐西的科學灌輸引進、第二是有益農人减輕災荒的水利工作、已經同建設廳許廳長商洽開渠的計劃、第三是農產品改良、第四是衛生實施及獸醫的組織、這四種事業、經濟委員會已大致擬有辦法、並由省政府把小西湖的地方撥作甘省辦事總機關之用、建設事業固然要有計劃和相當的財力、但同時亦要能全體恊力合作、方能達到光明的途徑、朱主席對黨國有極長的歷史、對於軍事政治有深厚的經騐、治甘未及一年、甘省的政治和治安、已有良好的進步、甘省人民已在復蘇之中、這是建設成功的一個基礎、昨天兄弟又與各界領袖唔談、得到許多益處、但是對於地方情形、究竟還不能十分熟習、在兄弟未離甘省以前、希望各界同志能隨時指導及恊助、在兄弟離開甘省以後、還請對於經濟委會西北</p>
<p>辦事處劉主任景山同樣的指導與恊助、兄弟敢下一斷語、有朱主席這樣賢明的長官、和各界同志的恊助、建設進行、一定是很順利而能迅速收效的、西北建設、是我中華民國的生命綫、西北人民所負的責任、不僅是充實本身利益而已、希望我各界同胞在政府及本黨領導之下、一致團結起來、傾全力於救國救民之西北建設、（七日中央社電）</p>

<h3 id="c183">讀書問答　答讀「讀勞働問題季刋後的質欵」的質疑記者先生： <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>當我讀到申報上勞動季報的廣告時，卽想到館要買一本，及至讀了四月二十九日和三十日的質疑與答覆，更鼓着勇氣花了五角錢的郵票。該書寄來以後，便一氣讀完。止不住要寫出一點意見，請求指敎。</p>
<p>該刋的内容誠如汪君所說，祇是較爲進步的討論勞動問題的刋物，未臻完備之點甚多，在這裏未便詳舉。惟讀汪君之質疑，似乎有點指摘該刋主張前後之矛盾，若謂果前是則後非，後是則前非，二者必居其一。我的意見稍微有點不同。率直言之，則二者皆是也。徒以「上海工人運動的回顧和意義」一文之作者文筆較爲拙劣，或卽因此而引起汪君之疑及先生和某君的批評。請申言之。</p>
<p>殖民地和半殖民地的民族資產階級之具有買辦性質，是一種鐵律。這些民族資本家受着帝國主義者的豢養，同時又受其剝削，他們惟有盡力取償於本國勞動羣衆以自保。這一點經先生引印度例證以明，已非常顯著。</p>
<p>但半殖民地的勞苦羣衆，對於本國民族資本家究竟應取何種態度呢？尤其是在中國這產對落伍，需要走向國家資本主義的過度時期以内，究應如何方爲合理呢？</p>
<p>我將這個問題提出請先生解答。</p>
<p>我認爲力言君所謂「民族的勞資鬥爭往往「熱烈於」普通勞資鬥爭」「句並未潛藏着」工人寗可當家奴」的意義，乃「五卅」事件等事實上之詔示所得的結論。其所以較熱烈者，正因其具有經濟的政治的。「二重性。」那有「想將工人反抗的情緒在美麗的言詞中消滅，進而取消民族革命」的絲毫意義呢？再看力言君的全文，只是表明中國工人丨尤其是上海工人丨是站在反帝國主義的最前綫，因有「主力」的結論。照先生之意，工人卽「萬分不够，」誰够呢？軍閥麽？知識階級麽？民族資本家麽？落後的農民麽？</p>
<p>至於結論第五項，上半段已包含着許多「意在言外」的東西。「而……」以下就文字上講是犯了大的錯誤。但在產業落伍的半殖民地，工人羣衆尙没有集中成爲可爆發勝利的革命的時期，不景氣的結果，徒使得若干工廠關門，成千百的工人被遣散，我們僅就該刋所載的一點材料不就够知道了嗎！天津，上海，鄭州，漢口，南通的紗廠，江浙的絲廠綢廠，不都是實證麽？去年上海絲廠工潮之暴發，是更不景氣的結果呢？還是絲業轉佳的刺激呢？去年年底全部絲廠停頓，工人等在家裏，能發生大的工潮嗎？這是「妙論」呢？還是事實呢？不要做形式羅輯的俘盧呀！</p>
<p>「一二八」事件刺激了工人的革命情緒是眞的。但一方面許多工廠關了門，或被炮彈轟燬了，工人弄得流離失所，致陷工運於消沉，也至少是一方面的事實吧！固然，工人内心的憤激是漲高了。不過如在俄國一九○五年至一九○七年革命以後，工人運動的一時消沉不也是事實嗎？况作者並没有說這是唯一的原因呀！　　這篇文章是有毛病的。文筆太拙劣是其中之一，其一部分或者是爲着避免甚麽。</p>
<p>上面拉雜寫了幾百字，敬求指正。</p>
<p>劉自立五月六日之江學院</p>
<p>我們尊重劉君的意見，將以上的「質疑」在此公佈，以供注意勞働問題的讀者們的研究。　　關於勞働問題季刋的評價，我們並不完全同意汪君的話，但也不能同意劉君所云「二者皆是」之說。該刋的價値，自有該刋自己去說明，我們不欲多費辭。</p>
<p>現在解答劉君的質疑。</p>
<p>劉君問「半殖民地的勞苦君衆對於本國民族資本家究竟應取何種態度呢？」這答覆很簡單，卽是：在經濟鬥爭的意義上說，半殖民的工人對待本國民族資本家與帝國主義廠方没有絲毫差别，也不應有差别，同是工人階級鬥爭的對象，而在政治意義上則不然，如果本國民族資本家階級是站在眞的反帝的立塲的時候，工人階級是支持本國資本家階級，結成反帝的同盟。反之，本國民族資產階級不反帝了，他們變成了民族解放的一種障碍，這時，在政治上也是取着對立了。於是反帝反土著資本混合而爲一鬥爭對象。</p>
<p>把「民族勞資鬥爭往往熱烈於普通勞資鬥爭」這一句話孤立起來，自然可說不潛藏着什麽，可是，如果從這點進而說明這是上海的工人可以充當民族的主力，這種捧塲，顯然是由工人對「本國資本家反抗比較和緩」爲條件而來的。這不能不含有不正確的意義，所以我們認爲我們覆汪君的話還是正確的。至於劉君說：「照先生之意工人既萬分不够，誰够呢？軍閥麽？」我們却深爲劉君可惜，劉君没有讀通一句話，卽不愼重的提出憤駡，殊爲劉君不取，這「萬分不够」明明是指該文作者以「民族的勞資鬥爭往往勢烈於普通勞資鬥爭」說明這是上海工人爲民族主力的不够，而劉君竟未看出，未免是跡近有意的詭辯，到底誰是形式邏輯的俘盧呢？</p>
<p>對於結論的第五項，我們認爲我們所引用的話是正確的。「不景氣」的結果雖然一方面是關廠，失業，一方面並不是劉君所幻想的「工人等在家裏，能發生大的工潮嗎？」我們尤以爲劉君對勞働問題既有意研究，則應注意現實，看最近巴黎的暴動，奥京巷戰：倫敦飢餓遊行隊的騒擾，美國大罷工是否由資本主義轉佳的刺激呢，還是經濟不景氣的結果？卽就中國而論，今年是不景氣最深入的一年，中國今日之工潮也爲五卅以後所未有。最近上海某廠的然，產業轉佳亦足刺激勞働反攻，但這一時期的表現也多限於經濟的意義，不像飢餓的驅使所促成的堅决的戰鬥含有濃厚的政治意味。劉君能熟記產業轉佳對於勞働的刺激，却忘了不景氣下更有驅使工人走入巴黎血案的塲面。這也是可惜的。</p>
<p>「一九○五丨○七年俄國革命以後。工人運動「時消沉」是事實，這一方面是因當時俄國進入大反動時代，政治的壓迫使脆弱俄國工運不能不一時低落，同時也還是因爲俄國當時社會民主黨的分裂，失了强固的領導。今日已不是一九○五丨○七年的時代，老調子不能再唱了。我們不想在這裏用文字去辯證中國目前的勞働狀態，我們想請劉君自己去看當前發展的事實。不要專只看表面，要深入的觀察。</p>
<p>總之：「上海工人運動的回顧和意義」一文，决不是僅有文字上的毛病，而是理論的錯誤，歪曲的解釋，對於一般讀者是有壞的影響的。（完）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>在現在的中國國民政府裏，或是在　國，在其他的國家，一個當内政部長或是當相等的職務的人，他的政治上的地位，總是很重要的；可是我們這裏所講的慶善，便就不同了。他所掌理的事務，都是些很瑣屑而很微細的。所以說得確切一些，他實在是等於一個富貴人家的僕從，或是男管家。他的「内務」，其實就是「宮務」。而他的地位和别位大臣不同的所在，也祇是他在宮中接近太后的時候，比别人格外多一些而已。要是在相當的機會上，太后凑巧想需用他，便就近敎他幹些雜務；這樣，他也可以凑此而鑽營了。</p>
<p>無論他的的才幹是怎樣的平庸，他的地位是怎樣的無關緊要，可是他的服式，却委實是非常的精緻！在本書這一章裏，作者所要描寫的主要點，就是這些大臣們的服式。他們的服式都是合於標凖的，像制服一樣的整齊。慶善照例也是戴着一頂小洋傘式的圍帽，帽頂上裝着一顆珊瑚製的紅色的頂子；在滿淸時代，紅頂子就是一品大臣的標記，端的是貴不可言！帽子的後部，還有一根孔雀毛製的翖子拖着，當他的腦袋晃動時，往往有耀人的光在閃動。當然，他還不能用「雙眼」的翖子，因爲這種翖子是一種最榮耀的裝飾物，非經朝廷恩准是絕對不許濫用的。有淸一代三百多年的歷史裏，能够得到這裏特殊的賞賜的，不過寥寥三四人而已。丨其中的一人，便是大名鼎鼎的合肥李鴻章。（二九）</p>

<p>— 一震</p>
<p>象棋在我們中國是最普通不過的娱樂品，平常人都懂得怎樣下法，什麽跳馬，飛象，劃車，促卒，义士···</p>
<p>···使用得很敏捷。</p>
<p>下象棋的意思，不免是消磨辰光，解除無聊，但倒也是鍜鍊思想的好方法。</p>
<p>記得有次自上海回鄕，對坐的是位英人，車過了龍華，他取出一副美觀的象棋，强邀我下棋，居然他對於這套也很有功夫，他說：「中國的麻將和象棋的確是偉大的發明，這東西我們英國也很風行，下棋時，思想沉默，精神合一。」話是說得不錯，我當時回答：「是，你們的葉子戲也是偉大的發明！」兩人都笑了起來。</p>
<p>本來象棋是淸高的玩具列入「琴棋書畫」之一，現在老槍們，辦了副杉木的，搭起三脚架子，在馬路邊頭，居然也做起生意來，這未免是太侮辱子。</p>
<p>象棋是人生的縮影，法國義默伽謨在魯拜</p>

<p>校長：那很容易，你照這樣對伊說：「我生平最恨金鋼鑽，許多男子，都曾用它騙取了無數女子的愛情；許多女子，都曾被它破壞了貞操，沾汚了靈魂，張小姐！我不願用這種骯髒的東西來換你神聖的愛情！你要我的心，我都能立刻挖出來獻給你，張小姐！我實在是因爲太尊重你，敬愛你的原故啊！」</p>

<p>校長：女人，好像一瓶醇酒，聞聞味兒很香！喝一口很甜，可是你兩口，三口，就得醉了　　學生　：先生！那末兒男人是什麽東西呢？</p>
<p>校長：男人是一枝蠟燭！越是嬌傲，越是架子大的女人，越想去愛伊；要是有一個女人，自動的女人，越想去愛伊：要是有一個女人，自動地先來愛你，你一定覺得平淡，覺得無味，甚致於還要討厭伊，唉！男人眞是一枝蠟燭可憐蟲：先生！你是不是男人？</p>

<p>校長：你看！人家都成雙成對的去玩了，只有你這蠢貨！一天到晚呆頭呆腦的，到現在還没有找到一個愛人，照這樣，對於本校的名譽上大有關係，凡在本校畢業出去的學生，個個都是情塲的常勝將軍，祇有你，這樣不爭氣！</p>
<p>好！我現在限你三天！要是到第四天你還没有我到愛人的話，馬上開除！馬上開除！（校長氣憤憤下塲）</p>

<p>— 繆崇羣</p>
<p>南京卡通之一</p>
<p>久已享名的菰菜，蓴羮和鱸膾，恐怕不只吳中的名士想它，只腹之慾稍强一點的人們見到這些字眼，也許暗暗嘬幾下嘴，讓唾涎悄悄嚥進喉嚨裏去的。書上的東西畢竟解不了饞，正如同說望梅止渴也是一句反話似的。不過這年頭却不比從前了，稍稍帶些地方風味的東西，藉着交通的便利，差不多都可以朝發夕至了。像浙江有個什麽地方出蔣腿，不脛而走地遍全國；還有，像南京這個地方所謂的「官禮」丨鴨子，千千萬萬的鴨子竟仿彿受了封謚般地被帶到四面八方去了。　　一看見貼着官禮字樣的蒲包，便知道是南京的鴨子了。我知道的南京，差不多就當我知道官禮鴨子的時代罷。於是我想，鴨子的南京啊！</p>
<p>初次到一個南京朋友家裏去吃晚飯，桌上四樣菜，倒有兩樣是鴨子，一紅一白，并且我淸淸楚楚地看見每塊鴨子上都帶着一簇簇的黑色的毛。不知怎麽我的週身起了陣雞皮粟子，心裏不住地暗暗呌苦起來　　丨不要客氣，吃呀，有名的南京的鴨子。明友一塊兩塊的給我挾。</p>
<p>我細細地咀嚼着，但除了嘗到鴨子固有的那種氣味之外，并没有發現出鴨子還有着「南京底」一種什麽味道。</p>
<p>被鴨子的氣味薰淘着，我不能再吃半碗以上的飯了。鴨子堆滿了我的碗裏，朋友還是繼續地勸：</p>
<p>丨吃鴨子丨</p>
<p>我心裏想，難道把鴨子當飯不成？但朋友的態度却像是默認似的。同時他又覺得我不解南京人的好意，有些怏怏然的神情。於是。轉過來再介紹鴨子：</p>
<p>丨這紅的是燒鴨；那是鹽水鴨（指着那白的）；到了秋天就好了，還有桂花鴨子……</p>
<p>丨不是還有官禮鴨麽？我切斷了他的話，甚實也是補充他的話。</p>
<p>丨對了，那是板鴨。</p>
<p>關於南京的鴨子的名目的認識，這是第一次。後來在一本學生的課卷上，（我出的題目大約是「我的回憶」）她率眞地述叙着，大意是：</p>
<p>「……平素不喜歡用功的我，到了要應中學入學試騐的時候，我常常着急而哭泣了。母親說不要緊，用過功給我買鴨子吃……一天一天的過去了，飯是吃得很香，因爲每頓有我最喜歡的菜丨鴨子……考試也過去了，也揭曉了，那天許多朋友在我家裏，我是考取了，爸爸從外面走進來，拍着桌子大聲說丨是吩咐我的母親的，「給她多買鴨子吃啊」！起先我倒駭子一跳，後來才知道是獎每個南京人的血液裏麽？」可是，我不敢那麽說的。</p>
<p>我是常常詛咒鴨子的，記得有好幾次當着黃昏日暮的時候出門，逢到鴨子店的門口，便不大走得通了，無數的端着空碗等着切鴨子的人，密密地塞滿了小巷的道路。爲了鴨子。我也有此詛咒南京起來了。但是想到這些人們對於鴨子的愛好，對於鴨子的推重；想到了那次在朋友家裏喫晚飯的事，我又狠狠地懊悔我竟過拂朋友的好意了。</p>
<p>一個南京的女人，現在和我同居着。有時吵了，她的那種聒耳的聲音，使我默默的嘆息了；有時氣了，她的那種使人勵我的···那天的鴨子是多麽好吃啊！都儘我吃也嫌不够吃哩……可是後來有許多同學見了面便說：「買鴨子給你吃呀！」我的臉一陣紅一陣白的……回憶中的鴨子啊！</p>
<p>絕不是我的臆測，由許多許多方面的認識，我漸漸知道南京的鴨子不止名目繁多而已，鴨子在南京確實是有着它的一種「神秘的」，「興奮的」力量的，它在什麽地方呢？「潛伏在嘔心的氣質，又使我默默的嘆息了。但是求好也是一件頗容易的事，只要提議買鴨子吃，便什麽也完了。然而我替代了我的嘆息的話，可總也没有說過一次；我不能說：「你這鴨子般的喉嚨和氣質」的。</p>
<p>鴨子，在南京恐怕是最多最多的、種屠殺；但我不知道那數不過來的「鴨子的精靈」是伏託在什麽人的身上或血液裏去了。</p>
<h3 id="c220">論改革法 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 三心</p>
<p>如果「天下興亡，匹夫有責」不是瘋狂者的囈語而必引爲自己的嚮導的話，則負起這責任時當稍注意施展的方法！</p>
<p>也許這不太苛求吧，改革社會時大概先得「無我」，爲一己的私怨而攻撃旁人自號改革社會的人是多的，爲自己的經騐良好貿然推及旁人介紹於旁人，這種辦法也是多的。前者「假公濟私」的例子太多，不必舉；後者是「介紹良醫」或因中藥治好了次頭痛便提倡國醫，自己吃素便宣傳天下人皆應吃素之類。</p>
<p>那麽醫時濟世，猶良醫之用藥吧，以病者爲主體，則診斷的方法是値得考慮的。某先生曾以提倡房子通空氣的方法爲拆牆，而結果是開窗而已，但也是原來的目的；這是明白了改革社會的方法後之苦言。對於目前這種龐大的黑暗勢力加以改革，不能輕率簡易，而是要用大的方略的。</p>
<p>如果無我的改革社會，社會没有不改革的道理，萬里長城和金字塔不都是人爲的麽？愚公移山天帝也怕他。何况社會到了這種地步，人人思改革，處處可改革呢？　　用矯枉過正的方法，自知其過，亦不爲過。三打孔家店於前，再捧出一部論語（是雜誌）給人家看，庶幾略略可以撕去道學之紙冠，這不過是一個小例子而已，是一法。覷凖了社會的弱點將投槍刺去，也是一法。此外，可行　方法也多的很！</p>
<p>可慮者，是自己「費厄」，有時不見對方之殘忍；只看見雍容的笑臉，不見其張牙舞爪的眞形，在好像敵人求和而正想收降的當兒，其實是被包圍了！……</p>

<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>前幾天同一個朋友談到現在中國需要作一個啓蒙運動。又有一位說用不着。究竟中國現在需要不需要作一個啓蒙運動呢？</p>
<p>這用不着高談闊論，我們且看一看中國現在的事實罷。</p>
<p>我們淸淸楚楚地知道，現在有不知道「唐，吉訶德」爲何物的文藝批評家，更有不知道高爾基是現實主義者而且又是浪漫主義的作家。而這一流的人物，都是專門家，或凖專門家，或自擬專門家，而且還怕是不止一人。</p>
<p>中國文藝是上了新的階段了麽？當然，不是没有好些好的萌芽。可是到處還充滿着lgnorance。</p>
<p>中國到底是「老大帝國」。是不是有些文人學者，在知識上還是過着中世生活呢？</p>
<p>「五四」時代，我到日本讀書。同鄕某君，在帝大專攻經濟學。有人勸他看「新靑年」。他說那是耶穌敎宣傳品，他不看。</p>
<p>有一次，友人馮君培告訴我一件趣事。他說：某省督學下鄕視學，至某處中學，聽地理敎員講地理，正購到英國，敎員說，英吉利啊，英者英國，吉利二字殊不可解。</p>
<p>我又聽到一位中學歷史敎員講拿破侖</p>

<h3 id="c223">明人尺牘 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>「明人尺牘」四卷，淸王元勳含章，程化　　乘合輯碧雲樓原刋本。收一百十六家尺牘，凡三百四十六通。書前有汪繹於康熙乙酉中秋所作序，首先說，「尺牘小技也，然非有得於古者不能爲。」次則說，「自前明以來，選者數十家，而善本絕少，」於是他批評到楊用修王匹貞的「淸裁」，說「憾其博而不精，左氏之詞命，兩京之詔册，並加竄入，殊不爲類。」最後總說到兩編者「槪斯道之蕪靡，欲一洗之，蒐羅明賢之作，彚爲一編，其去取劇有苦心，非苟以悅俗者也。」實則，這部尺牘，所收雖頗有佳作，去取雖謹嚴，仍舊有一部分不免冗長迂腐，令人昏昏欲睡，其成就是並不高於「淸裁」的。普通每人一二首，至多亦不過五六首，而張居正特選二十五首，歸有光選十四首，湯顯祖選十五首，王衡選十四首，錢謙益選十四首，是很可以想見作者們的偏愛。全書分訂四册，前有尺牘小傳，書品極佳，每人另頁寫印，字體極秀麗，據我所知，此書尙有蘇州刋本，但寫印方面，殊不如原刻。</p>
<p>本書所收抒情之作甚多，其間表現作者感情最爲眞摯沉痛者當以中郎「與蕭允升祭酒」一通爲代表，此書在中郎全集中似未收入。其文云：「射堂夕月，西門春柳，猶記往日周旋否？屈指十年之間，故交落落，有若晨星，伯修墓上，白楊幾堪作柱，百念那得不灰冷也？」而歸有光與沈敬甫書所云：「　詩乃哭耳，不成詩也。昨見諸友，多欲爲僕解悶者。父子之情已矣！惟此雙淚爲吾兒也，又欲自禁耶？」所反映之作者情緒，是更爲奔迸，心緒之亂，尤可於字裏行間見之。其表現憤慨之情者，在此書中，我得有楊愼與張丈一書：「年來萬慮灰冷，唯文字結習未忘，頗以此自累招罪，用是勇念書壁云：「老境病魔，難親筆硯；神前發願，不作詩文。」自今以始，朝粥一碗，夕燈一盞，作在家僧行徑。所持者，龐公「空諸所有」四字而已！」憤世嫉俗之情，橫溢紙上，作者之無可奈何的逃避，亦表現靡遺。此外則有范景文寄黃石齋書：「兄去後，時事不可言矣！今日既非前日，恐明年又厞復今年！此堂非燕雀可處，急欲圖歸。奈滿朝皆互鄕人，主上孤立無依，不忍恝然去國。明知伴食無補，然恐一且有事，求一伴食者亦不可得耳！言之潛然！」衷心的憤激，矛盾，亦一一現諸紙上。</p>
<h3 id="c224">「請敎先生兩首詩」并序 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 痰迷</p>
<p>知堂老人，五十自壽有詩。海内名流，紛紛奉和。。獨以某公「拂地褲緣疑病馬」一聯，可謂奇絕。此外「茶苦由來卽苦茶」，亦可算見道之言。迷亦　　好詩，藉韻奉林先生兩首，以博一粲。</p>
<p>「學匪」先生亦世家，攪將泥土上僧裟。</p>
<p>豎子昔敎驚唳鶴，叭兒今已化騰蛇。</p>
<p>閒看海派多如水，見說人間亂似麻。</p>
<p>桃李正開春正好，不妨花底漫煎茶。（註一）</p>
<p>「幽默」如君頗「大家」，漫吹烟霧繞緇裟。</p>
<p>人間原自多鼷鼠，夫子由來惡懶蛇。</p>
<p>小品縱多蝸篆壁，大音無奈甲彈蔴。（註二）</p>
<p>高丘苦無餘子，又起風波一盞茶。</p>
<p>（註一）荆公有「金谷看花莫漫煎」句</p>
<p>（註二）唐人有「紙補箜篌蔴接弦」句</p>
<p>。你猜他怎麽講呢？他說，拿破輪者，力大如牛，可以把車輪子拿得破，故名之爲拿破輪。</p>
<p>如此一類的事實，不勝枚舉。可是，這是過去的事情了。現在怎麽樣呢？現在，看看我們的中等學校罷。固然，有些學校在作八股式的白話文，而還在作「愛國說」，「漢高祖論」，「原人」等等的文言文的也怕不在少數。</p>
<p>現在，在「滿洲國」的鐵路網之完成，爲完成日鮮滿交通最短距离，正在修築羅津港，等等事體，恐怕國人大都還不知道。大學畢業生不知赤峰在哪里，是像毫不足怪似的。</p>
<p>在各方面，表露着中國人缺乏常識。在文藝的領域上，亦似不能有例外。現在的中國，對於世界文學多少有個概念的人，眞不大多。現在還是名詞萬能時代。一望是洋服靑年，新名詞新術語滿口都是，可是對於某一種東西，他是否深有理解，則是大可疑問了。</p>
<p>我以爲，對於現在的文學靑年，我們應當切實地作一番啓蒙運動。從各方面，由淺入深地，使他們眞地了解文藝。而我們的批評作家，同先進諸國的作家批評家比較起來，不客氣說，自然是幼稚得多。我以爲每人對於自己都應作一番啓蒙式的切實的敎育工作。我們的批評家作家是不是大都犯着幼稚病呢？</p>
<p>啓蒙運動，在現在，我以爲，是非常必要。是不是呢？</p>

<p>— 唐錫如</p>
<p>在這靜寂裏，突然一架汽車，像是趕急了的肥猪，噑了幾聲，往阿發身邊衝過，掃起一陣塵灰到他身上來。</p>
<p>「你别神氣活現！三天後我也要買一架給你看看！」他這樣想着時，非但不怨恨剛欃過去的汽車，他反笑了。</p>
<p>三天後哪·他眞希望明天便是三天後的日子！</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>似乎永遠不會來的第三天，最後是來了，而且是過去了。</p>
<p>阿發没有中，這雖是個奇蹟的年頭兒，可是儘有許多事情是使你失望的。</p>
<p>不過，慢着，上帝是賜福於有耐心肯等待的人的。</p>
<p>當然，在失敗後，阿發免不了要自責，要自己譏笑自己。像妻兒在鄕間挨餓，自己却在這兒荒唐哪！一百二十個字，圈十個要中七個是如何的萬難哪！二角錢並不小，可以够自己吃兩三頓哪！要是荒唐，還不如去光東戲院看荒江女俠來得實惠哪！······</p>
<p>責備的理由，不算不多，責備的理由，也不算不充分。可是一切都是徒然，都攔不住想發財的心理。這次失敗，是格外加强了他要買山舖票的念頭了。他不買，上次輸掉的兩毛，祇好算白去，不會翻本，這他可不甘心。况且一百二十個字，變來變去會變到那兒去？總有出來的一天！他不相信，偏要坐實這幾個字！</p>
<p>山舖票他已經買過，興隆的舖票店，走進去也並不難。他買了第二張。</p>
<p>又是焦急的等待，恐懼的等待；又是許多幻想，肥皂泡般美麗的幻想。</p>

<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>近幾日來的報章，請了眞要使人有點兒害怕：五月三十日「軍縮總委會」的日期是一日近一日了，但不料每日竟載着「普遍軍縮殆絕望，歐洲各國惴惴自危」，「世界戰雲籠罩，各國兵工廠趕造軍火忙」，「英國保險商不收承保兵險」，「歐洲戰謠日熾」，「法决定擴充海軍」，「東鄰野心無饜，蘇聯主席視察全國防務」，「遠東風雲變幻，美擴海軍刻不容緩」……用了大號的鉛字·大書而持書，實可呌人觸目驚心的了？同時，我們再來看看最近的，也可說已經過去的（因爲這是「與日俱增」的呀！）一些「小統計」吧：世界每年軍費達五十萬萬金元；本年德國軍事預較去年增加百分之四十强；日本海軍建築已經到了條約限度的百分之九十五；法國軍費占其預算百分之二十，每法人平均負担軍費十三·六元美金，負担之重，要居世界第一……這樣，那末這個閙的很久的所謂「軍縮會議」其所謂的效用與將來的結果，什麽也都可認識與預知的了。</p>
<p>本來，在現階段的情勢中，想要來什麽「裁軍」，「軍縮」，那眞是痴心夢想，自欺欺人吧了丨丨在這樣的「會議」之下，各帝國主義列强都本着想要擴充自己的軍備而裁他國的軍備之主也丨丨並且在不久的過去而同時尙繼續着的，什麽「聯盟」，什麽「公約」被日本帝國主義之視若無物而破壞殆盡的事實，正是最良好的對照與明證也。所以，「世界大戰又將來臨了！」這是許多的人所憂心着的。但是，第二次世界大戰固將不可避免嗎？她的可能性與原因在那裏呢？要解識這種種，那惟有先從歷史過程的客觀底條件來說起不可。</p>
<p>我們早就能知道的了：因爲在於許多落後的國已經捲入了世界資本主義的漩渦中，因此就造成了各資本主義國家資本輸出的可能性：而同時，因爲在於各資本主義國家早已達到「過份的成熟」，而牠們的資本（那當然先在於其農業的不發達和大衆貧困的條件之下）「有利的」投放塲所早已不敷其用了，因此就造成其資本輸出的必然性，這就是各資本主義列强的「再接再勵」，「貪心無饜」，「爭先恐後」地爭取着她們底「有利的」投放塲所，銷售市塲，並至原料源泉；這也就是殖民地的開拓與爭取。當然，由於諸資本主義國家的爭取高度利潤率的商戰，就不可不備兵戰，但是既要備兵戰，那就更預竭力的商戰，來富裕其財源；因此，諸資本主義國家的軍備愈比愈上勁。而牠們的商戰也愈來愈猛烈，到後就只有以駭人聽聞的兵戰來暫時解决一下。但是諸資本主義國家的内在底與相互間底矛盾在這種情勢之下是只有一日比一日尖銳化起來而永得不到解决。如一九一四年第一次世界大戰時的德，法，英，俄…等諸資本主義國與到今日來牠們間的情勢的終不能相容·正是極好的證據了。（未完）</p>

<p>— 何覺夫</p>
<p>乘上到靈隱去的公共汽車，是在細雨霏霏的淸早。雖是在早上，鵝毛似的細雨是在不斷地落着；但，善男信女的香客，還是絡續如雲地在泥濘的途上走着。</p>
<p>跳下公共汽車，踏進靈隱寺的首門，舉頭看看兩邊牆壁上遍帖着的黃紙標語，兀站在道旁和每一個門口的背着長槍刺刀的武裝同志，橫竪在道上的牌樓和掛在牌樓上的「歡迎ＸＸ……」的白布大字，你總會疑心自己是走錯了路，誤進入什麽祝捷或歡迎什麽大員的大會塲裏來。但，及至走進首一座大堂宇時，情景就另換一個面目了。在這裏，大門前的兩邊，雖也站着好幾個背着長槍刺刀的兵士，但在裏面所看得到的，只是天神似的泥像，裊繞的香烟，晃動的燭影，虔誠跪拜的男女香客而已。丨丨看來，香火之盛，恐是自開寺以來所未有的吧！</p>
<p>穿過大堂，聳立在前面的，是一座巍峨的大殿宇。在那裏，就是我們的大師和喇嘛們設壇唸經的地方。在通過大殿的甬道兩旁，有好幾個衛兵在守護着，遊客是不可以隨意上去的。當我邁步直進時，却被一位守兵欄着問：</p>
<p>「你有没有入塲劵？」</p>
<p>「没有！」我恭誠地答·</p>
<p>「没有入塲劵是不可以進去的；不過，如果你急得要一看的話，你可到庶務處要求一張。」他一邊說，一邊指着走廊中的一間小屋子告訴我。</p>
<p>我隨他所示的方向走，到了庶務處時，看見牆壁上帖着「入塲劵非賣品」的幾個大字，我總私自想着。大概只要說幾句誓言似的說話，便可以拿到了吧？但，及至將自己的來意對庶務員說後，他竟從抽屜中拿出好幾本簿子來，擺在我的前面；並且裝着笑很温和地說。</p>
<p>「是的，非賣品；不過，是有一種小限制的。就是誰要超度亡魂或爲自己求福，隨意捐助一塊或拾塊做本會的費用，就可得贈劵一張。如查誰都可以隨意來拿，那倒可不必花好多錢來印這些東西了。先生，你想是不是呢？你就將你的大名寫在這裏吧，你是爲自己求福的嗎？」</p>
<p>聽完他的話，我没有說個什麽，因爲要花這麽多錢，我是根本辦不到的；但。看看上面擁擠的遊人和香客，我又確有些心動。我好像已失了判斷力似的　只在走廊上徘徊着·沈思着！</p>
<p>算是托天之福吧，同在這裏辦事的一位靑年·看見我的躊躇樣子，就走近我的身旁，對着我的耳朶輕輕地說：</p>
<p>「你給我二毛錢，我借給一張你吧；，不過，這是我私人的，你到上面看完後，是要交還我的！」</p>
<p>「謝謝你！」花二毛錢，就可以看到許多新的事物，我當然是十分樂意爲的。我馬上拿出二毛錢交給他，就趕快沿階走上大殿去。</p>
<p>殿宇的門口，緊緊地擠滿了一大羣看客，我費了不少的氣力，才得將身子擠進去。裏面，堆在正中的，是我佛如來的金身，金身的下面，是我們大師的座位，大師的兩旁，列坐着十多個喇嘛。在他們的面前，放有好多萊藏文佛經和笳角笙弦之類器。在大師的指揮下，大家都取了同樣的節奏，同樣的調子，在「啦啞沙……」地唸着。唸完後，接着就奏了一陣藏（？）樂。丨丨看樣子，是十分虔誠的。我苦苦地緊擠在人堆裏凝看了一個多鐘頭，老是唸一回經，奏一回樂相繼續着；没有看到别的新花樣，我的確感到厭倦了。我偸偸地向着大師致一個敬禮，就從人堆中擠出，蹈上歸路來了。</p>
<p>在歸途上，我總默默地這樣想着。我們苦難的芸芸衆生，經過大師這樣苦心的禱祝，誰敢不相信便能得救呢？</p>

<p>— 鎭球</p>
<p>矛看來自不調恊。世界上事物如果都能順流進行，中途没有阻力來爲難，矛盾就不會發生了。譬如我們現在是生當封建盛世，我們對於舊社會的制度習欲會奉行無忌，無論燒香拜佛者舉人畜婢女，都覺得毫不奇怪。但是既來了封建社會之後却又來了資本主義社會，這就是所謂中途有了阻力來爲難了，我們就覺得在資本龐大的勢力下南京路上十幾層的　天　旁同時再發現中　時代的古色古香的「虹廟」爲矛盾現象了；在婦女服裝競相崇尙袒胸露臂裸腿的潮流中，同時再發現個把蓄髮纒足的婦女，也成爲矛盾現象了；如果這時候更有人讀</p>
<p>趙子曰孟子云企圖考舉人中狀元，則更要被人駡爲頭腦冬烘思想落伍不堪做人！因此所謂矛盾完全是不調恊所來，而不調恊完全是時代變化的結果。</p>
<p>但是在中國「英雄造時勢」的議論之中，矛盾的基於「時代錯誤」性又不成立了。英雄可以造時勢，時勢的變化可以發生矛盾，則矛盾不是間接可由人力造就的嗎？因此矛盾成了人的腦袋中的東西　而最後索興漸漸忘掉了牠的眞正來源了。</p>
<p>本來中國孔夫子的中庸之道是呌人做到一個「中」，矛盾不矛盾正不必十分顯露出來的，無論應付甚麽事情最好都辦理得糢稜兩可百面玲瓏，則尤其合乎藝術。大丈夫心中有些不高興，輕易不會形於外，外表還是保持了一副泰然自若的態度；阿Ｑ被人打了，能够把自己譬喩爲打者的「老子」來安慰自己。因此中國的矛盾早已納入中國人的中庸之道的涵養工夫中了。</p>
<p>又譬如法西斯主義進了中國，有人抬舉　爲「世界大勢所趨」的政治思潮，難道你批評他抬舉得不合理？因此此說也是大有藝術造詣的。</p>
<p>中國簡直没有矛盾可說，矛盾到了中國是被中國民族寛大深刻的涵養工夫所溶化了。因爲中國民旅的中庸思想是一貫的，所以矛盾到了中國恰恰變成爲「統一」。這也正是「英雄造時勢」所造成的。</p>

<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>從掛着生殖器和野獸徒手相搏的時候起，人類慢慢地知道鑽木取火，架木爲屋，直到現在穿起了華貴的服裝，住了高大的房屋，還飛機，大砲，　克車的發明不已，而那些和人類同時相搏的野獸，最神氣的也不過替海京伯賺錢，人爲萬物之靈，倒底不是一句虚話。　　住在都市中的人類，更是不可一世，坐汽車，吃大菜，卽以小學敎科書上所謂以避風雨的房屋，已講究得一塌糊塗，就是鴿籠式的，也灶披間，擱樓，曬台間的頭是頭，道是道。人類中認爲最下等的鄕下人到上海來，恐怕進了大門要不知後門在那裏，所以燕子兎子等想築一個　　　　個　　　　　　　　琵琶，彈亦不要彈。</p>
<p>房子的講究不算數，一切動用家具也日新月異的摩登起來，夫妻淘裏一定要睏兩張床，衣櫉，沙發，桌子都已變成了一種呌不出來的式樣，摩之登之，美其名曰立體，確是海外奇談。</p>
<p>照我的祖父的祖父遺傳下來，居室以舒適爲主，家具以合用爲主，所以抽水烟袋的時候，一定要坐太師椅，夏天吹風凉，有闊而且長的春櫈，窩脚爐要有坑床，一切的一切，好像已進化得無以復加，誰料萬物之靈的人類，對於舒適是精求益精，孜孜兀兀，無時或息，坐飛機抽大烟或者我的兒子就可以享這一類的福。我如其遲生五百年，寫稿子可以用電力了。</p>
<p>一拉就是這末遠　，閑言少說，言歸正傳，話說我的朋友中了航空獎券，棄鴿籠式的亭子間而住起尖頂方門三角窗的堂堂大厦來，自然内部裝飾，務求摩登，以求居室以舒適爲主也。各種家具，都匠心獨造，床低既及地，僅夫妻淘裏也備了兩只，衣櫉成多邊形，圓其桌，大供塡鴨一只，沙發如糞箕，若便於夫妻淘裏克司者，梳妝台如大戰後之草棚，傾斜奇特，又若木料不全，免强凑成。某曰，約友三四造其居，衆嘆摩登家具不置，我雖亦忝爲人類之一，竟像老虎之遇電鞭，發不出威來了。</p>
<p>呆是吃飯時，發生難問題，呌來小菜，摩登圓桌不敷應用，還是娘姨房裏的紅木破方桌足供大嚼一頓。飯後無可消遺，提議打打麻將，而難問題又是這摩登圓桌，四個人共八只手及麻將一百三十六只，小小戰塲，如何下哀的美頓書？摩登誠害人不淺哉。於是抽其香烟，取於糞箕形之沙發，此摩登比較合用，如夫妻淘裏擁抱克司，樂在斯中矣。然而抽香烟之單身漢，對於抛烟頭，撣烟灰必大動乾坤，整個身體一俯一仰，太師椅就没有這樣嚕囌。萬物之靈的人類何以一時糊塗造出這些不合用的摩登貨來，那幾條海狗還在大世界表演絕技，大可以化兩毛錢去學一點愚者一智。　　最後據說他們夫妻淘裏，自進摩登住宅以來，總是合床而睡，另一張既不可以作裝飾品，雖設而不睏，暴殄天物也。</p>
<h3 id="c255">女子的流通病 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 小岑</p>
<p>什麽人都說女子有幾種流通的病症。諸如虚榮，小氣，嫉忌，依賴，被動</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>等等都是。我也覺得不錯，似難否認的樣子。若是不信，我們可以看：社會上多少的女子是爲着虚榮而自陷入深的痛苦中；爲着小氣和嫉忌而發生種種無意義的衝突和誤會而致演成悲劇；不稍施粉脂以娱男子，終變爲人家的玩具；好依賴和舉止被動致形成自己是一個毫無意志的薄弱女性。尤其是一個很革命兼有高深的學識的女子，若是她愛上了一個反革命的男子，結果她也去幹反革命的工作，也許是抛棄革命的重大的責任而願意退到腐舊的社會裏去過依賴，嫉忌，爭吵，討好，虚僞的生活。我認爲這更是暴露了女子不能向上的弱點。我們不是說每一個女子必定患着這種弱點和病症，至少是佔了百分之九十是這樣的。</p>
<p>事實這種流通病，不是單爲男子所洞悉，女子自己也很知道，不過她們不肯去救治它罷了！她們老是願意自己没有出頭的日子似的，不去檢閱自身的短處，甚至受人批評的時候就要發一些驚人的脾氣。這樣不知自重，似乎難怪幾千年來，她們都是被壓迫着！歷史很明顯的告訴我們：女子一向在社會上都是被欺侮的。不錯，這個我們是歸咎於往昔社會制度不良的關係。因此淸帝一經推翻之後，直至五四運動的時節，女子解放的聲浪哄喊了許久；這明顯的是給女子自救的一次大的機會。可是這個聲浪到底還是聲浪而已，它不能成爲很切實的，使到女子從那個時候以後就得着眞的解放，取到眞的平等的社會地位。關於這，我們不能不說一方面是這個社會的咎誤，他們施行着欺騙的敎育，他們不肯指導她們去實現她們在社會應有的權利：而另方面呢，不能不說女子自身的不知愛惜，自重的去改除自己的病症，攀着前進的路努力向上，她們任由别人替她呼不平，自己却不經意，讓這個聲浪慢慢的在空氣中消沉了。把女子的地位保持着同昔時一樣的態度，或者可以說比前者更失却她的價値！昔者女子尙能操理家計，算是盡了她一份人類之責而現在的所謂新女性，讀了好多年的中外文字，不知道究竟她們能貢獻於社會什麽？雖然社會，不能給她們的機會，但，至少自己先得自重自檢，把無　識的魔病除去，充實自己的學問基礎，作奮鬥的凖備。</p>

<p>— 兪周文珮</p>
<p>阿香是一個窮人家的女兒，十五歲的年紀；是每一個少女最美麗的季節。她已發育得十分完全，人家都說：「像阿香這樣一個小妮子，是應該有一個如意的夫婿的。人又美麗，而且很能幹，看她照顧兩個小弟弟，是這樣小心翼翼的，鄰居們永遠没有聽到孩子啼哭的聲音。</p>
<p>也是這樣美麗的一個春天，人們都從冬的簫瑟中換上了一口新鮮的空氣。阿香感到現在不會再在縮瑟的西風中打抖了，手上幾處凍烈了的部份，也已漲上了紅層層的新肉。到個美麗的田野，看到美麗田野裏蓬勃的新生，啊，季候的春天又到了！</p>
<p>她望到對面的山麓上，有一列人羣在蠕動，這些黑瞳瞳的影子，雖然她不能詳細地辨别着他們的輪廓。但是她能够肯定的知道，决不是在這個鄕村裏習見的人羣。</p>
<p>等影子漸漸的近來，這些飄着領帶的，穿着咖啡色春季的服裝的，年靑的少爺們中間，隔着幾個絲圍巾短外套的小姐！阿香很羞慚地，以爲自己决比不上這般幸福的人兒，在他們的手裏，都提着三脚的盡架，在還有一張盡板上，就是這座山景的輪廓。阿香看到塗在紙上的顏色是美麗的，滿幅靑興綠的綫條，在春天　　　　人覺得高　　這般高　的哥兒和小姐　，他們都對阿香投　了注意的眼波，阿香祇有含羞地低下頭，在這般人的中間阿香景渺小了。</p>
<p>在這個村落　，天天就有這般男女們的出現，他們在畫板上舖着一張白紙來到，但是當歸去的時候；終是塗上了鮮明的顏色。當他們走過阿香屋子的前面，每次都投過了不平凡的眼波。阿香也在這個快要傍晚的時候，在一天的疲勞下，望着遠的山景，看着油綠的田野。這樣有了三四天以後，他們的眼波是熟練了；在阿香也不會覺到再有羞恥的可能。</p>
<p>於是在阿香的腦子裏，劃上極深刻的痕跡。在有一夜的夢中，她看到自己也雜在他們的隊伍中。但是當她在夢中醒過來的時候，東方已現魚肚白了。悲哀就襲撃到她的心頭，怎樣現實還是一個從前的阿香呢？阿香怨倦着這個鄕村，她以爲城市的一切；是演着多少美麗之喜劇的。</p>
<p>當太陽快要沉没在地平綫的層裏，阿香又看到這隊幸福的人羣；又帶着興奮的臉色歸去。在走到他們屋子的前面，在這個隊伍裏，一個比較忠厚的長者；就站在阿香的面前。</p>
<p>「姑娘：我想和你們家裏人接洽一件事。」阿香没有回答，就健康的跳着身子跑到裏面去；他們也就跟着進來。　　「我們是城裏美術學堂裏的。」當阿香的父親，迎出來的時候·這個原先對着阿香說話的，就欠着身體；很有禮貎的自剖着：阿香站大一邊，臉龐上覺得熱辣辣的在燃燒着。</p>
<p>「先生到這裏有什麽事？」</p>
<p>「哦，我們是在這裏山上寫生，已有好多天了。我們看到你們的姑娘很聰明，所以我們很願意呌她到我們學校裏去做……」</p>
<p>阿香的父親，聽到城市裏是很罪恶的，尤其是這般穿着西裝的先生們。但是當他抬頭看到後面的幾個小姐時，他以爲那個是呌他們的女兒去伏侍這般小姐們的。阿香的父親，正愁着家裏有這樣的一個女兒。而且幾年以來，他已負上許多的債了，假使他的女兒能够替人做活的話，至少可以省去一個人的飯米。</p>

<p>— 高原</p>
<p>在埃森斯坦和亞力山特洛夫合作的電影脚本「全綫」的序言上，埃森斯坦關於電影脚本應採取怎樣的形式，發表了如下的意見，關於電影脚本作者和導演的工作範圍，頗多闡明，不久以前我們影界也曾惹起脚本作者和導演工作應否由一人兼任的問題，現在擇要譯述如下，以作參證。</p>
<p>由號碼區分的電影脚本，是和排列在騐屍體脚下的號碼同一程度的復話，是不能產生電影的。</p>
<p>在本質上，電影脚本不是材料的形成，而是材料成立過程中的一個階叚。　　電影脚本，是存在於——由情緒（Temperament）消化了的某一選擇的主題和將牠視覺的地具象化，這兩者之間的一個階叚。</p>
<p>電影脚本不是舞台脚本。</p>
<p>戲劇，若是没有在舞台上效果的地演出，牠本身還有獨立的的價値。戲劇中，尙有作永久讀物的價値。反之，電影脚本，是在無數造型的形態之中，求牠本身的具體化的，情緒的發露的速記錄。</p>
<p>電影脚本，是僅爲了碰然拔去木塞，使香賓酒湧溢似的情緒，流入乾入渴的喉頭裏去而存在的酒瓶。</p>
<p>電影脚本，是由一情緒移向他一情緒的暗號。</p>
<p>電影脚本作者，以他特有的手叚給與電影脚本以知覺底韻律。</p>
<p>導演參加在這上面，將這種知覺底韻律，移植成導演本身所特有的語言卽電影的語言。</p>
<p>導演丨丨</p>
<p>發見出應該變更文學的報告的，電影的同格物。</p>
<p>問題的根本，卽在此；而不在畫面連續的順序，脚本上事件的故事的連續等。</p>
<p>我們對於電影脚本的要求簡單的說就是如此，這一見解，給向來標着一個一個號碼的「攝影劇本」的形式以致命的打撃。</p>
<p>電影脚本的最壤的塲合，是由普通的職人寫的，這種電影脚本，不過是將要給觀衆覽的東西，因襲的地，視覺的地叙述着而已。</p>
<p>然而，秘訣是在於將要提供到觀客前面去的種種體騐的連鎖，由電影脚本來形成。</p>
<p>當探求組織的地制作這一種電影脚本的時候，我們於是就到達了電影小說的形式。</p>
<p>照這一形式，我們所看凖的，是將在銀幕上丨丨例如由家畜之羣。日落，瀑布，或無涯的荒野這些手叚所提供的東西，用文字明確地在紙上表示出來。　　我們的所謂電影小說，本質上，同是使將來看到那一電影而感動的觀客，極度亢奮，而複製起來的故事。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c259">評「情天恨海」WharfAngel丨大光明丨 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>雖然這也是以三角戀愛爲主要題材的，但是在許多同樣取材的美國影片中，這「情天恨海」却應當是出類拔萃的了。</p>
<p>我們並不僅僅因爲作品中所表現的一切；甚爲接近中國人的傷感情懷，而給與它較高的評價，反之，假使我們很細心的把握了整個的作品，那末我們承認本劇的兩位導演將劇作者所要表現的愛情與友情的衝突和矛盾，確是有了充分的理解而忠實的表現了出來。</p>
<p>友情和愛情的衝突，這也許是我們經常可以看到的現象吧。然而我們現在所要注意的却是劇作者對於故事發展的過程之精密的描寫，非常戲劇性的將每一個塲面强調於心理變化，這應當是這一作品第一個特點。而這些都是借重於每一個演員之眞切的技技，乃是不消說的了。</p>
<p>第二因着劇作者先有了劇本的縝密的結構，所以每一塲與每一塲之間的戲劇的聯緊，很可以看出電影藝術的地成果。自然這主要的是導演者的功勛。他給與我們淸楚明瞭的感覺，不浪費，不嚕囌，是他表現方法的特長。</p>
<p>是的，從導演的Ｍontage方面，從畫面的構圖，從對於周圍空氣的描寫從劇的Ｔeinpo的把握，從對於劇中人個性的發揮，各方面都可證明導演有着豐富的創作經騐和文學的修養。</p>
<p>但是，在故事的發展上，多少還有些缺點，如寫Ｔoy和Ｃomo在樓上房間中的一夜，我們並不覺得是怎樣深濃的恩愛，而且這種愛情是發生在一個歌女身上，於是在以後Ｔoy的如何忠於情等等，不免使人覺得不大自然。這是說前面的怖置頗爲不够。其次，當Como被捕之後，從歌女Ｔoy身上未嘗不可以激成一個極悲壯的高潮，如大喊大哭的望着他被捉進牢獄，那可以給人們更深刻的印象，至少比較最後隔着鐵門談話的收塲，較爲有力。不過，這是美國片ＨＥ的影響，雖然這收塲並不如何快樂，多少也給人們此恨綿綿的感覺，可是到底不是這一影片應有的結尾方法。</p>
<p>然而，在這裏是劇作者意識形態之具體的表現。很明顯的，在友情和愛情的衝突之外，還寫到法律的殘酷。但是那决不是主題，不管他對於法律這東西也表示不滿。所以，在最後假使以這一點爲主題，必定是使觀衆從法律和警察方面得着最深刻的慘痛印象，反之，正因爲劇作者不敢攻撃現社會法律的不合理，而又覺得牢獄和警察到底是可怕的東西，於是不得不自圓其說的聊以解嘲，說明爲女人而出賣朋友的人，以其自警察局所得來的賞金，給犯人請律師辯護。卽是說，法律這東西始終是公正的，更不消說，他是維持了法律的存在。　　此外關於友情和愛情之衝突所構成的主題，劇作者很强調在兩朋友間内心矛盾的鬥爭，因此他說那杜克的告密，完全是爲洩憤，並非貪圖一千元的賞格，這也許不能給與我們更眞實的感覺。因此，也使我們會以爲這一故事乃是合乎無巧不成戲的俗套了。然而再說一句，這一個戲是和中國人的行活感情相當接近的。</p>

<p>— 古月</p>
<p>「暴雨梨花」，顯然地是一個悲劇，一個諷刺人生的悲劇，比「人生」的描寫還要深刻，還要動人。</p>
<p>小英喜歡吃麵包，小琴喜歡吃飯；小英羨慕着燈火煇煌的都市，小琴却是個瞎子，所以終以小英是被誘惑，這是極好的一個預兆。</p>
<p>小英被誘後回家見她姐姐的時候，她身上穿的是絲織的衣裳，可是她姐姐所摸着的却是布的，這明明是小英在欺騙着她，可是小英這時怎想到人家正是在像她欺騙姐姐一般的欺騙她呢？人生本來是欺騙，這是很好的一個對照和諷刺。</p>
<p>講到演出方面，誰都不免有失當的表情。</p>
<p>小英被引誘到施家去的時候的表情，是極難的。但她一幕一幕地想着，都能應付得過，這是成功的。</p>
<p>小琴是個瞎子，瞎子的眼睛是不能動的，當然，誰都承認，小琴是很難担任的角色。有幾個需要内心表情，也有相當的成功。</p>
<p>高占非無可批評，因爲他根本是配角，我想。何非光是扮個壞蛋，還没有袁叢美的壞蛋扮得好。</p>
<p>我們最不能忘懷的，便是裏面一個不知名的小妹妹，她有很活潑的表情，我認爲她是有希望的，希望聯華當局能好好地培植她。</p>
<p>「暴雨梨花」是描寫一對姊妹，一對思想不同，遭遇不同的姊妹，較之於明星公司「姊妹花」另具一種諷刺的意味。我相信，「暴雨花」的劇情比「姊妹花」來得深刻，來得緊張。至少！可以和「姊妹花」並稱。</p>

<p>南丹聽了他弟兄們的話，沉思了半嚮，然後宣言道：「阿姆希爾，你的話一切都不差···」</p>
<p>···你們的意都對的……你們所說的話，個個字都有理的……不過丨我們却非打倒拿破侖不可！」詹姆斯很惶惑的問道：「什麽道理呢？」南丹於是站了起來，不慌不忙地講出一番道理來。他說：「什麽道理呢？就因爲我們是露德蔡的族人……以目前而論，我們並不祇是五個有錢的猶太人，尋求着大機會。我們要知道，那是全世界所知道的，無論你是不是猶太人，要是拿破侖一天不去掉，歐洲就一天没有和平。這是你們萬萬不能否認的事實！」古都拉聽了，歡喜得了不得，她將身體靠着南丹。然後南丹又發言道：「我們一定要冒些險。我們祇可以暫時忍着氣丨不能受一些私慾感情的衝動丨去爲世界的利益盡力。我們儘可以和拿破侖聯合起來，讓他繼續地十年八年戰爭下去。我們的錢儘可以用來購買軍火和血，直等到全歐洲變成了一個大屠殺塲丨但是猶太人所得到的，有什麽好處？還不是終身作押當的生意？我們萬萬不可那樣丨我們一定要爲和平而奮　，如同從前一樣，但萬萬不能爲戰爭助虐。如果我們必須滅亡，我們亦要帶着榮譽而滅亡。我們不可以遺留一些慚愧在我們後頭丨無論在什麽地位！」</p>

<h3 id="e1">British Trade Minister Announces Implementation of Trade War Against Japan in the House of Commons; New Plan to Protect Business Interests; Increased Tariffs, Abolished West African Trade Agreement, All Colonies Restrict Japanese Goods Imports <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Today in the House of Commons, the British Trade Minister, Runciman, answering questions about the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, stated that the British government feels it can adopt a comprehensive plan to protect its commercial interests without having to cancel the treaty. Therefore, there is currently no intention to cancel the treaty. Regarding the British market, the British government feels that the silk tariff issue cannot be delayed for consideration. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain has instructed the Import Duties Advisory Committee to prepare a detailed report on this matter as soon as possible. Colonial Secretary Lister has consulted with the governments of the colonies and protectorates to adopt appropriate measures and will ask all colonies except West Africa to adopt import quotas for cotton and artificial silk goods imported from all countries, to restore Britain's inherent position in cotton and artificial silk goods. The proposed quotas will be based on the average annual import volume from 1927 to 1931. The British government also proposes to quickly establish necessary legislation in the colonies to prevent advance imports for profiteering purposes. Although this legislation will be enacted later, its effective date will be retroactive to today. The British government has notified the abolition of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty applicable to West Africa. British actions will be limited to Japanese goods. Currently, there are no plans to deal with goods other than cotton and artificial silk. The British government is well aware that Japanese competition is not limited to these textiles, so it will consider other related industrial events and the tariff behavior needs of the colonial market. As for the domestic market, this matter can also be dealt with according to the usual procedures contained in the Import Duties Act. The British government can no longer delay taking measures to protect its commercial interests, said the Trade Minister. Runciman concluded by saying, "We are, of course, always prepared to give careful consideration to any proposals that the government wishes to put forward, aimed at resolving mutual problems through mutual agreement." (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Today, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain informed the House of Commons that he has asked the Import Duties Advisory Committee to urgently resume work, revise the import tariff rates for silk and artificial silk, and submit corresponding recommendations. This confirms the statement made yesterday by Trade Minister Runciman. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Goods Heavily Hit; Cotton and Artificial Silk Goods Reduced by More Than Two-Thirds <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The actual impact of Trade Minister Runciman's announcement in the House of Commons regarding the new plan to counter Japanese goods competition is that, except for East Africa, which has special treaty obligations, the import of Japanese cotton and artificial silk goods into other colonial markets will be reduced by more than two-thirds. The average annual amount of Japanese cotton cloth imported into British colonies (excluding East Africa) during the five years from 1927 to 1931 was 54,402,000 yards. In 1932, Japanese goods imports increased to 146,564,000 yards. 1933 was even more. This year's imports have only continued to grow. The behavior of the British domestic market will depend on the results of the Import Duties Advisory Committee's research on silk tariffs. British industries that have suffered from excessive Japanese competition will also make requests to this Advisory Committee. Therefore, the behavior of the domestic market will also depend on the requests of various industries. In addition to Japan, France and Italy also import silk goods into Britain. Therefore, this matter cannot discriminate solely against Japan. The British government can consider how to adjust tariffs in its colonial markets to restrict Japanese goods other than cotton and artificial silk. However, in the domestic market, tariff behavior must be presided over by the Tariff Advisory Committee, and the government cannot act arbitrarily. In 1933, Japanese goods imported into Britain were worth a total of £7,227,000, while British exports to Japan were only £4,437,000. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Trade Minister Runciman recently announced in the House of Commons the government's policy to prevent the dumping of Japanese goods. The gist is that from May 7, British colonies will limit the import quotas of cotton fabrics and artificial silk to prevent the dumping of Japanese goods. In Britain itself, the import tariff rules for raw silk will be revised. As for the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, Britain does not declare its abandonment. Runciman also said, "Although the government hopes to reach an agreement with Japan, the actions necessary to protect British trade can no longer be delayed. Therefore, we notified the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Matsudaira, last Thursday that Britain believes it has the right to take any measures that are indispensable to safeguarding its commercial interests. As for the Anglo-Japanese Trade Agreement, we are confident that we can take all necessary measures to protect our interests without abandoning the treaty. We have informed the Japanese Ambassador that we see no reason to abandon the Anglo-Japanese Trade Agreement. As far as the British market is concerned, we believe that the revision of the raw silk tariffs can no longer be delayed. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has recently ordered the Tariff Committee to complete the report on the revision of the raw silk tariffs as soon as possible. As for the issue of dumping, it can be resolved by modifying the usual procedures for import tariffs. We have notified the Japanese Ambassador that the British Colonial Secretary has consulted with the governments of various colonies. The governments of the colonies all believe that protective actions are necessary and will uniformly implement import quota restrictions except for the West African colonies. This import restriction measure applies uniformly to cotton fabrics and artificial silk imported from foreign countries. The purpose of this measure is to enable Britain to restore its original position in the markets of these colonies during its normal trading era. The amount of import restrictions is based on the average amount imported annually during the five years from 1927 to 1931 and will be implemented from May 7. However, the West African colonies have been notified of the abandonment of the Anglo-Japanese Trade Agreement a year ago. Therefore, this area will be treated as a special case, and the import quota restrictions may be limited only to Japanese exports." Runciman concluded by saying that Japanese competition is not limited to textiles, and the government has also considered this. The government is still studying the actions necessary to protect colonial markets for other commodities. In short, we can no longer delay taking measures to protect trade interests. However, if the Japanese government proposes any methods that can solve these difficult problems, we should still study them with humility." After Runciman delivered his declaration, the whole audience applauded to express their approval. Some members asked whether they would take joint action with the various autonomous territories. Runciman replied that the various autonomous territories have already received notifications regarding this decision, but Britain cannot interfere in the internal affairs of the various autonomous territories. If the governments of the autonomous territories take action, it will be a voluntary action and not at the request of the British government. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Foreign Ministry Observation: Oppressive Policies Are Quite Unpleasant <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry has not yet received an official telegram regarding British Trade Minister Runciman's statement in Parliament on the import of Japanese goods into British colonies. However, the Foreign Ministry authorities' observations are as follows: (1) The memorandum of the 3rd contains the phrase "Colonial Empire," and because the meaning is unclear, Ambassador Matsudaira is currently being telegraphed to consult with the British Foreign Ministry. It is quite incomprehensible to declare and demand the immediate implementation of import restrictions on the one hand without the basis for Anglo-Japanese negotiations having been determined. (2) It has been reported that Hong Kong, Ceylon, and other colonies have expressed opposition. Even if implemented, it may not immediately affect Japanese trade. In the future, if the British side violates the most-favored-nation clause and attempts to damage Japanese trade, it will prepare to protest or urge reflection. (3) Since suddenly notifying the cancellation of the Treaty of Commerce in West Africa last April, adopting a policy of oppressing trade against Japan, a friendly country for many years, has made Japan quite unpleasant and has to be morally condemned. (Dentsu dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, a Reuters reporter visited a senior official of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. According to him, Trade Minister Runciman's declaration runs completely counter to the principles of free trade in Britain. In his opinion, the quota system violates the provisions of the most-favored-nation treatment in the treaty. He also said that the Japanese government is currently maintaining a silent attitude, but will seek to restore harmony with Britain in accordance with the traditional friendly relations between Britain and Japan to protect its treaty interests. Japan can freely take retaliatory measures at any time, but this case is extremely complex and requires serious consideration of what repercussions will occur in trade relations with other countries. Therefore, no decision has been made regarding retaliation at this time. Later, the reporter asked whether Japan should regard the British autonomous territories as one aspect of Runciman's quota system or as separate entities. According to the official's answer, the Japanese government is carefully studying this issue. Before deciding on a policy towards the British autonomous territories, the first step is to see what impact the quota system implemented by the British territories will have.

<h3 id="e4">Japan Deliberately Shows Calm; Believes British Action Was Unexpected; Says It Will Seek Compensation in South America and Manchuria <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday, Trade Minister Runciman declared in the House of Commons that the British government feels it has the freedom to take actions it deems appropriate to protect Britain's commercial interests and resist the competition from Japanese goods. This statement was truly unexpected here. However, Japan is now accepting it with a very calm attitude, probably because the content of the declaration makes the Japanese even more certain that it is difficult to exclude Japanese goods from tropical markets, because the purchasing power of the locals there is low, and they all prefer to buy cheap Japanese goods. At the same time, it is felt that the British government should know that it is difficult to set a quota that is suitable for the conditions of the colonies and is accepted by the local parliament and businessmen, especially in Hong Kong and Malaya. Furthermore, although the amount of Japanese commerce in British colonies is important, it is expected that the reduction after Britain implements the quota will not be huge, and the loss can be made up for by the goods that Japan sells in South America and Manchuria. The Japanese criticism is mostly that Britain is now trying to blame the failure of the London Anglo-Japanese Textile Industry Conference to devise a feasible plan on Japan. Britain is now threatening Japan in the hope that Japan will create a concrete plan that can be mutually accepted by the two countries. The Asahi Shimbun said that Runciman's memorandum to the British Ambassador in London did not discuss the proposals made by Lancashire, so it cannot be used as the basis for a joint official meeting. The Japanese government does not want to propose any counter-proposals. If Britain restricts the import of Japanese goods, Japan may implement a commercial protection plan to allow the government to adjust its imports and exports and revise tariffs. If the plan is implemented, Japan can levy the highest taxes on British manufactures. Japanese business circles and newspapers are now paying more attention to Japan's negotiations with the Dutch East Indies. Last year, Japan's exports to the Dutch East Indies were worth a total of 150 million yen. If a satisfactory mutual trading plan cannot be agreed upon at the Batavia Conference, which began on June 4, this trade route will be in danger. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, all newspapers except the Asahi Shimbun did not comment on the British Trade Minister's speech in the House of Commons yesterday regarding trade with Japan and the U.S. territories. The Asahi Shimbun expects the Japanese government to adopt a wait-and-see policy. At the same time, it firmly believes that the quota policy implemented by the British Empire and its various territories will not seriously damage Japan's trade and expects that Japan will be forced to implement boycotts against Australia and Canada. Today, the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry refused to comment on this matter, because he had not yet received a report from Ambassador Matsudaira stationed in Britain, and only said that Trade Minister Runciman's declaration was not unexpected.

<h3 id="e5">British Newspapers Unanimously Praise; Neither Humble nor Overbearing, Just as Expected; Still Advocate Maintaining Anglo-Japanese Relations <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(London) Trade Minister Runciman made a declaration in the House of Commons yesterday, stating the government's policy to resist the dumping of Japanese goods. This morning, all newspapers expressed warm praise for this declaration and unanimously praised the decisions taken by the government, believing that they were both gentle and resolute, just as expected. As the Times commented, all the efforts made in the past to make the Japanese industrial world realize and ease its policy of disturbing the world market have now failed. The government understands the overall situation and has taken swift measures to curb the competition of Japanese goods by limiting import quotas, and its steps are neither humble nor overbearing, just as expected. Among them, only the West African colonies are an exception, because in West Africa, the Anglo-Japanese Trade Agreement has lost its validity, so it is not harmful to the most-favored-nation clause to individually restrict Japanese goods. As for other places, the same import quota is applied to cotton fabrics and artificial silk imported from foreign countries, without any discrimination. Finally, the Times also hopes that all autonomous territories will take measures that they deem appropriate for the sake of the common interests of the Empire and follow in the footsteps of the mother country government. In addition, what is noteworthy is that some moderate elements in Britain still advocate maintaining good faith relations between Britain and Japan. Although those who have the most stake in the industrial world are demanding tariff retaliation, the moderates still believe that it is not advisable to act rashly and harm the relations between the two countries. For example, the British Anglo-Japanese Relations Committee was recently established with Liberal MP Bickering as its chairman. The purpose of the committee is to find ways to "avoid tariff retaliation to avoid disasters in the British Empire." Therefore, some moderate elements were not entirely satisfied with the government's decision this time. Judging from the tone of the Morning Post, the majority of Conservatives have always believed that the crisis of overproduction in the British textile industry cannot be eliminated only within the British Empire. As for the Liberal Party and the Labour Party, although they have always been the most opposed to the dumping of Japanese goods and the low wages in Japan, they oppose all the principles of tariff wars. For example, the Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, said that even if the policy of restricting import quotas is completely successful, the benefits obtained by British industry are almost like water bubbles, because if Japan is subject to various restrictions in the British colonial market, it will only turn to other neutral markets and intensify its development. These markets are actually even more important to British industry. In short, the only good strategy to solve the problem of international trade wars is to have the World Economic Conference put forward appropriate measures.</p>
<p>(Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>The London Daily Telegraph commented today on the plan to deal with Japanese goods competition in the British Empire market, saying that Japan is still in a good position and is no different from competing under normal circumstances. The British government has shown great patience and acted in a friendly spirit. The plan it has adopted should restore trade to a point where it can be generally agreed upon. Japan is a good customer of the British Empire, and Britain is eager to maintain this relationship, but it is unwilling to offer the markets created by Britain to Japan as a price. The Daily Express said that Trade Minister Runciman is now playing with fire and burning himself. Japan will compete more fiercely in more important neutral markets, and the benefits that British industry hopes to gain will eventually become empty bubbles. The Morning Post said that the quota imposed by the British government can effectively curb the expansion of Japanese commerce, but the final solution cannot be sought only in British colonies. The Times said that the British government has had to propose continued trade restrictions in an already turbulent world, which is something that the majority of the British people are reluctant to do, but the British government has no other way. The government has done its best to promote a friendly compromise, but when its efforts were unsuccessful, it had to quickly decide on a restrictive policy. However, this policy is still as moderate as expected. The British government is now only following what the Indian government has done. Japan has already voluntarily accepted the restrictions in India, so that the reduction in Japanese goods imports is greater than the new British quota. The British restriction plan will also be extended to Japanese goods other than cotton cloth and artificial silk goods, but the Trade Minister has stated in extremely solemn terms to Japan that Britain is eager to reach a mutual agreement on the restriction issue. It is hoped that Japanese industrialists will not forget the lessons of the breakdown of the Anglo-Japanese cotton industry conference. The Manchester Guardian pointed out today that Trade Minister Runciman's remarks are one of the most important steps taken by Britain in its protectionist cause. Judging from the Trade Minister's remarks, the Trade Minister obviously used the quota method as a huge stick to attack Japan. The Trade Minister has set several years as the period for its quota, and has also declared that the door for negotiations has not been closed. However, judging from the recent trends in Japanese policy, no one dares to say that this move can make the Japanese moved. The Financial Times said that since Tokyo has not yet put forward a concrete plan, Britain's resolute decision to implement the quota method is, of course, appropriate. Financial News also criticized and hoped that the Trade Minister's statement that the quota method would not be implemented in an unfriendly spirit would remain unchanged throughout, because foreign countries and India are still the most important markets for Lancashire cotton goods. If the quota method is implemented too hastily, it may only increase the competition of Japanese goods. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Britain Still Unwilling to Break Up; Hopes to Facilitate an Anglo-Japanese Agreement; Japan Can Boycott British Goods as Much as Possible <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>London Reuters learned from important sources today that what the British government is eager to declare is that Trade Minister Runciman's remarks in the House of Commons today did not contain any intention of an Anglo-Japanese split. The British government also wants to make great efforts to maintain the most friendly relations, so it still feels that an Anglo-Japanese agreement may be possible. Japan can take the same steps as much as possible to boycott the actions of the British government, but the most-favored-nation treatment clause in the Anglo-Japanese Treaty does not allow British goods to be discriminated against. Furthermore, the quota method does not apply to East Africa, because East Africa is in a special position under the Congo Basin Treaty (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>The Anglo-Japanese Relations Committee was established here in London today, with Liberal MP Pickering as its chairman. Its purpose is to promote a better understanding of issues involving Anglo-Japanese commerce and other issues in the Far East. Among the committee members are British experts on Far Eastern affairs, including David Evans, Walton, Whyman, and others. According to Booth, the honorary secretary of the committee, one of the purposes of the committee is to provide British people with accurate information so that they can thoroughly understand Far Eastern affairs.

<p>After British Trade Minister Runciman delivered his speech in the House of Commons, the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Matsudaira, received a reply from the Japanese government regarding the recent talks between Matsudaira and Runciman.

It is expected that Matsudaira will not meet with Runciman again until the Japanese government has reacted to the plan stated in the British House of Commons today. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Anglo-Japanese trade negotiations have been stalled for a long time. After Trade Minister Runciman made a declaration in the House of Commons yesterday, Britain expressed its intention to resist the dumping of Japanese goods by limiting import quotas. As a result, Anglo-Japanese relations suddenly became tense. One of the first effects of this move was that the United States once again embraced the hope of taking joint action with Britain to deal with Japan. Regarding this matter, it is faintly heard that the U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Bingham, has had contact with the British government today. According to reports, when Davis, the U.S. representative to the Disarmament Conference, traveled to Europe two months ago, he made a proposal to the British government regarding Anglo-American joint action. The U.S. White House advocated holding the 1935 naval conference in Washington and ordered Davis to suggest to the British government that the two countries start preparatory negotiations in London before the naval conference is held. Later, when Davis returned to the U.S., he seemed to express pessimism about this matter, because at that time Britain was trying to resolve commercial disputes with Japan in a friendly manner. If Anglo-American negotiations were held, it would be tantamount to the Anglo-Saxon countries uniting against Japan, which would inevitably be suspected by Japan, thus hindering the progress of Anglo-Japanese trade negotiations. Therefore, Britain was particularly unwilling to make this move. However, since Runciman made a declaration yesterday, in the eyes of the American people, the policy of commercial compromise between the governments of Britain and Japan has come to an end. There is a possibility that Britain and the United States will cooperate jointly. That is why the U.S. proposed a plan for Anglo-American joint action two</p>
<p>months ago, but it yielded no results. Now the U.S. hopes to revive it, which is not without reason. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources today, the United States does not want to be involved in the whirlpool of the Anglo-Japanese trade war. Since Britain advocated restricting the sale of Japanese goods in its territories, the Anglo-Japanese trade war has been unavoidable. Officials here believe that this trade war is only related to Anglo-Japanese commercial interests and should be considered separately from Japan's statement rejecting foreign aid to China. Therefore, the United States should strictly maintain neutrality in this matter. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Reflections on the Qin Family Tragedy: A Current Affairs Commentary <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>The matter of Madame Gong Yinxia, wife of Qin Lizhai, and her children taking poison together as a family has occurred. On the one hand, we are saddened by this tragedy befalling the family of a deceased colleague and cannot help but shed tears of sympathy. On the other hand, we must analyze and explain this suicide, which is highly suggestive and stimulating to society, in order to prevent it from having a negative impact on society. Harsh criticism is unbearable, but sympathy must also be tempered. Hesitation in writing is understandable to the reader.</p>
<p>Suicide can be caused by emotional impulse, economic hardship, or the pressure of living circumstances. Reading Madame Gong's last letter, though full of sorrowful words, such as "I have prayed day and night that this tragedy could be averted" and "I have wanted to commit suicide and stopped myself more than a dozen times," it is clear that it was not purely due to emotional impulse. Regarding economic problems, she herself said they were "temporarily solvable." Therefore, the main reason for deciding to take poison with the whole family was the pressure of living circumstances. Looking at Qin Pingfu's letter to his daughter-in-law, he used superstitious oracular pronouncements and serious traditional ethics to force Gong to return to Wuxi to live with him. Gong's last letter contained the painful words: "Oh, Lizhai, if you want something, why don't you tell me but tell others? And say that I should live in Xi. What are you thinking?" The conflict here is self-evident.</p>
<p>The Madame Gong we know was a virtuous woman deeply cultivated by old traditional ethics. However, her life of more than ten years was a new type of family life that maintained monogamy with spiritual components. Her life, habits, and thoughts were already in such conflict, so it is only natural that she was saddened by the death of her husband because she could not bear to destroy the existing new family life, and that she felt extremely distressed because she could not resist the pressure of traditional ethics. In the end, she had no choice but to end her life. Alas, Madame Gong was simply a victim of the conflict between the old and the new in the current era. Suicide is considered a crime in law and an ominous event in social custom. However, in sociology, theories differ. Some attribute it to the individual, while others attribute it to society. Was Madame Gong's suicide the fault of the individual or the fault of society? This is truly a question worth discussing.</p>
<p>Finally, we must take this opportunity to solemnly tell readers whose living circumstances are similar to those of Madame Gong that the only way out for those who suffer in an era of conflict between the old and the new is to strive hard, strengthen their will, and uplift their spirit to resist the environment. This is the proper way to live. Suicide, even with sympathy, should never be taken as a model.</p>
<p>I worked with Qin Lizhai for twelve years and had a close friendship with him. I was a classmate of his father, Pingfu, in my youth and also worked with him. I know that both father and son, though rich in new knowledge, could not abandon old moral concepts. Madame Gong, wife of Lizhai, came from a prominent family and naturally received thorough traditional ethical education. Unfortunately, she was caught in the conflict of the present society, surrounded by difficulties, and wandered in fear without a way to break through, and thus this tragedy occurred. After Lizhai's seventh-day memorial, Madame Gong brought her two children to the office to thank colleagues for their condolences and to discuss the children's studies with me and Mr. Wu Tegong.</p>
<p>She questioned us regarding her own career and how to support the family in the future. Although her words were sad and bitter, I did not see any signs of a desire to die. I told her that she could come and talk to me no matter what difficulties she encountered. She agreed and left. Her long hesitation and final decision to die did not give me a chance to comfort and persuade her, which is my regret. Alas, the dead are gone. This problem is not just a problem for the Qin family; its impact extends to the entire society. Therefore, I especially bear the pain to discuss it.</p>

<p>(Beiping) After Wang Bingxiao's Civilian Corps, which caused unrest in Yutian, was surrounded by the Security Team in Yanshankou, Zunhua County, on the 6th, the corps suddenly made several demands, mainly that each soldier be given six yuan in severance pay upon disbandment and that firearms be handed over only after wages were paid. The Security Team authorities decided to invite secondary leaders of the civilian corps to negotiate, but they had all fled. Most of those who came were foremen, who were ignorant and made increasingly complicated demands, resulting in no outcome. Until late at night, the Zunhua Security Team at Yanshankou suddenly withdrew, and Wang Bingxiao's Civilian Corps took the opportunity to flee in secret. On the 7th, they disturbed the area north of Yutian City and then dispersed. In total, about sixty firearms were confiscated from the corps this time, and the rest of the firearms were taken away by the civilian corps. The Security Team is paying attention to the pursuit and suppression. The Yutian and Zunhua county authorities are coordinating measures to maintain public order. Wang Bingxiao himself is still under surveillance in a certain township in Yutian. (Eighth dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central People's Movement Guidance Committee issued a special circular telegram to all levels of Party Headquarters and people's organizations across the country to commemorate the May Ninth National Humiliation. It reads: "To all provincial and municipal Party Headquarters, special railway Party Headquarters, special seamen Party Headquarters, and all directly subordinate special district Party Headquarters, and forward to all subordinate people's organizations: The shame of the nation deepens, and the national crisis intensifies. Compatriots, with painful memories of the past and a determination to prevent future occurrences, how should we be resolute, diligent, and ever mindful of May 9th as the critical juncture for the survival of our nation and people? It is hoped that all our countrymen will think about pain in pain, inspire loyalty, do everything to restore the self-confidence of our nation and revive the inherent moral principles and discipline of our country, and cultivate a strong and steadfast spirit of perseverance in the face of adversity. The more urgent the crisis, the more fundamental the plan. Shouting and running around is not the time now. Strive to survive through hard work, ensure that you are capable of undertaking tasks and performing labor services, and concentrate the opinions of the group on the great task of saving the country and the nation. Those engaged in production should double their efforts and strive to maintain the interdependent and unobstructed path of agriculture, industry, and commerce. Increasing the strength of the people is to protect the life of the nation. Those engaged in social, cultural, and educational undertakings should be encouraged to proceed, be able to endure hardship and stand tall, rectify people's hearts, unify their steps. Soaring high and galloping far is of no help in times of difficulty. Withering and following the old ways will only lead to the country's demise. Being faithful to one's responsibilities on this day is a practical contribution to the cause of national salvation. Worry about the country and strive to revive it, be mindful of this, understand shame and know the right direction, and start by guiding and gathering the people. All Party Headquarters have a heavy responsibility. They should immediately and deeply encourage and implement this with sincerity, so as not to fail in the mission that the Party should bear. We earnestly hope for this, and this telegram is sent." Central People's Movement Guidance Committee, May 9th. (Eighth dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e22">Song Ziwen Eloquently Discusses Northwest Development in Lanzhou; Hu Junzhuang Injured in Horseback Fall <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Lanzhou) All sectors of Lanzhou held a grand welcome meeting for Song Ziwen on the morning of the 5th. Song's speech was as follows: "Chairman, fellow brothers, it is a great pleasure to meet with the compatriots of Gansu in Lanzhou today. I just heard the chairman's welcoming remarks, which were overly complimentary to me. While I am very grateful, I also feel very ashamed. Two weeks ago, I entered Tongguan from the capital and was very satisfied with what I saw and heard in various aspects of Shaanxi because, although materially poor, the people's spirits are extremely high and very different from a few years ago. Everyone is full of vigor and hope for recovery, not the kind of sitting around waiting for death that I saw in the 18th and 19th years of the Republic. Now that I have arrived in Gansu, everything I have seen gives me the same impression of the entire Northwest. I believe that the future of the Northwest is very bright. People from other provinces who come to the Northwest for inspection generally have two kinds of impressions. One is to vigorously praise the profound culture of the Northwest and to view the Northwest with the eyes of a writer or poet. The other is to criticize the backwardness of production, the lack of education, and the poverty of the people, viewing the Northwest with the eyes of a foreigner. I believe that both attitudes are biased and inappropriate. The prosperous and glorious history of the Northwest in the past was the result of the efforts of our ancestors. We cannot only remember the achievements of our ancestors; we must be ashamed of the uselessness of our descendants. Thinking about the past and forgetting the present means forgetting to continue the efforts of our ancestors in the future. At the same time, we must know that our entire China is a backward country. Although the southeastern provinces are more advanced than the northwestern provinces, they are still unable to advance like the great powers every day. Moreover, the current material progress in the southeastern provinces is not because the people of the southeast are more intelligent or hardworking than the people of the northwest. It is entirely due to the geographical advantages of the southeast, because the coastal provinces have convenient transportation and can absorb the economic and scientific forces of Europe and the West. If the northwestern provinces can also use the economic and scientific forces of Europe and the West, they will certainly be able to restore local prosperity and consolidate the foundation of the country in a short period of time. The construction of the Northwest is not a local problem; it is a problem for the entire country. Now that the provinces along the Yangtze River and the coast are already under the fire of invaders, we</p>
<p>should quickly pay attention to construction in the Northwest hinterland, the birthplace of the Chinese nation. After the European War, Turkey, in a very dangerous situation, moved its capital from the prosperous Constantinople to Ankara, the birthplace of the Turkish nation. Our country, in a time of extreme crisis, should also pay attention to construction in the Northwest hinterland, the birthplace of our nation. The Central Government attaches great importance to the construction of the Northwest. Chairman Chiang and President Wang are unable to attend to military and political affairs, so I have been commissioned by the Economic Commission to represent all the standing committee members and come to</p>
<p>the Northwest for inspection. The construction of the Northwest is a huge topic, and there are many things that should be done. The Economic Commission is suffering from limited resources and can only select urgent and basic tasks and do them step by step. What we have planned is, first, the roads for transportation with the Southeast. Before the Longhai Railway is completed, we will first build the highways, plan the transportation methods perfectly, and bring in the economic power of the Southeast and the science of Europe and the West. Second, there is water conservancy work that will benefit farmers and reduce disasters. We have already discussed the canal opening plan with Director Xu of the Construction Department. The third is the improvement of agricultural products. The fourth is the implementation of sanitation and the organization of veterinary medicine. The Economic Commission has roughly drafted plans for these four undertakings, and the Provincial Government has allocated Xiaoxihu as the general office for Gansu Province. Construction undertakings certainly require planning and considerable financial resources, but at the same time, it also requires the cooperation of the entire country to achieve a bright path. Chairman Zhu has a very long history with the Party and the country and has deep experience in military and political affairs. In less than a year of governing Gansu, the politics and security of Gansu Province have made good progress. The people of Gansu are already in the process of recovery. This is a foundation for successful construction. Yesterday, I also had talks with leaders from all walks of life and gained many benefits. However, I am still not very familiar with the local situation. Before I leave Gansu Province, I hope that comrades from all walks of life can provide guidance and assistance at any time. After I leave Gansu Province, I also ask that you provide the same guidance and assistance to Director Liu Jingshan of the Northwest</p>
<p>Office of the Economic Commission. I dare to make a judgment that with such an enlightened leader as Chairman Zhu and the assistance of comrades from all walks of life, construction will certainly proceed smoothly and quickly yield results. The construction of the Northwest is the lifeline of the Republic of China. The responsibility borne by the people of the Northwest is not only to enrich their own interests. I hope that my compatriots from all walks of life, under the leadership of the government and the Party, will unite as one and devote all their efforts to the Northwest construction that will save the country and the people." (Seventh dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Lanzhou) For Song Ziwen's inspection of the Northwest, Hu Junzhuang of the Shanghai banking community was invited by Song to come and inspect the commerce of the Northwest. Song went deep into the interior of Shaanxi and Gansu. He personally investigated and studied Xianyang, Jingyang, Wugong, Qishan, Fufeng, Xingping, Baoji, Fengxiang, and other counties in central Shaanxi Province. After arriving in Lanzhou, he went to the countryside every day for on-site inspections. On the morning of the 6th, he flew to Xining, but the plane could not take off due to rain and damage. He then rode horses with Zhu Shaoliang, Deng Baoshan, Zhu Duomin, Hu Junzhuang, Liu Jingshan, and others to inspect the area dozens of miles outside the city. When passing through a mountain road in Gucheng, the packhorse lost its footing and fell. Hu was crushed, fracturing his right leg, and immediately fainted and lost consciousness. His companions carried Hu back to the provincial government. Wang, the director of Zhongshan Hospital, and Dr. Siba, a League of Nations health expert who came with him, examined him and found that his right leg was broken. Surgery was performed immediately to set the bone, and his condition was good. He was also conscious. According to the two doctors, Hu's horsemanship was fortunately good, and only his leg was injured. According to the injury, there is no danger to his life, but there is no orthopedic equipment for treatment in Lanzhou, so he must return to Shanghai. After five or six weeks, the leg bone can be completely restored. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai by plane this Thursday. At that time, rumors spread in Lanzhou that Song himself was injured, and all parties were shocked. Many people went to the provincial government to inquire. The rumors were dispelled after the news was disclosed in the newspaper. (Eighth dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>

<p>(London) After the Cabinet Disarmament Committee met this morning, Prime Minister MacDonald summoned other cabinet members to hold an emergency cabinet meeting. The convening of this emergency meeting is said to be due to a conflict between two factions in the cabinet. The Prime Minister MacDonald and Lord Privy Seal Baldwin faction advocate that the disarmament treaty must be linked to a wide range of safeguards, but several other cabinet members, such as the ministers in charge of national defense, oppose proceeding with disarmament talks. Since the recent debate on the disarmament issue in the House of Commons, the dispute between the two factions in the cabinet has intensified. The convening of this emergency cabinet meeting may be because the Cabinet Disarmament Committee has already reached a consensus and submitted a disarmament policy to all cabinet members for a vote. Whether they can agree to this approach must be expressed immediately by all cabinet members. Although details are still difficult to ascertain, one thing is clear: that the British cabinet is concerned with, nominally, the disarmament issue, but will henceforth focus on planning for the security of Great Britain.

<p>(London) The "Daily Mail" reported on the 23rd of last month that some British manufacturers were preparing to sell aircraft engines to Germany. According to sources in the British aviation industry, the French government, based on the above news, has requested an explanation from the British government. Relevant French parties believe that if this matter proves to be true, then this behavior is completely contrary to the exchange of views between the British and French governments on the issue of disarmament and the speeches repeatedly made by British politicians. British officials said that civil aviation parts are entirely within the scope of commerce and the government cannot prohibit their sale, and there is no charter that can distinguish between military and civil aircraft parts. British people are now advocating the establishment of a disarmament convention to determine the nature of various aviation equipment and their manufacturing parts. (7th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Saar Regional Government Committee sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations for transmission to the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations. This letter is very important because there have been rumors in the Saar region recently that a violent coup will occur to overthrow the current system in the Saar region, so the Government Committee will submit a letter to the Executive Yuan to expose it. (8th Havas Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers have reported in great detail on the demonstration of 250,000 Saar residents in Zhibelbruggen, a place on the German border, but most of them do not comment on it. The famous columnist Botina wrote in the Paris Echo that the section on the protection of voters' freedom in the Alexi report of the League of Nations is insufficient. He advocated that the citizens' election should be postponed immediately until the protection is sufficiently increased, but Bo did not mention how the protection can be considered sufficient. Furthermore, at the same time as the Zhibelbruggen demonstration, the Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly, Freibo, gave a speech in Sassangni. He is the most forceful advocate of France's policy in the Saar region. His declaration has clearly indicated that France has automatically abandoned its claim to annex the Saar, but is still committed to persuading the Saar people to agree to maintain the status quo.

<p>(London) Lord Pengsonby submitted a motion in the Upper House today, strongly advocating a more resolute Far East policy, especially regarding armaments. Pengsonby declared that newspapers are rumored that the Japanese Imperial Family should ask England, with the intention of examining England's guns and cannons. The Japanese Imperial Family has ordered guns and cannons from armories, which is undoubtedly true. These guns and cannons will obviously be used to deal with the British army. Pengsonby continued that Japan's recent warning to other countries not to interfere in Chinese affairs is tantamount to announcing the Monroe Doctrine of East Asia. England's every submission to Japan's demands is also unfavorable to the whole world. However, after Foreign Affairs Second Secretary Stenhope explained England's position, Pengsonby withdrew his proposal. Stenhope stated that the British government is satisfied with Japan's declaration to abide by the Nine-Power Treaty and the Open Door Policy in China. Regarding the active action taken by Britain in the Far East, Lord Stenhope said that without the cooperation of the United States, any restrictive action is impossible, and the United States has no indication of considering this action. Since Japan's recent declaration and the failure of the Anglo-Japanese Trade Conference, England's position in the Far East has been the focus of parliamentary debate. (7th National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Lords held a meeting today and had a lengthy and broad debate on the Far East issue and the disarmament issue. This debate was caused by the resolution of Lord Pengsonby, a member of the Labor Party. Pengsonby's resolution was based on the fact that the current Far East and disarmament issues are quite worrying, so he asked the government to adopt a more active policy on these two issues. When Pengsonby explained the case, he questioned the government, saying that Japan's actions clearly violated various international treaties. Japan's occupation of several provinces of China by force and its separation from the rest of China are undoubtedly in conflict with the Nine-Power Treaty, but the British government is surprised that it seems to be satisfied with this situation and the Japanese government's recent response to British negotiations. Then Lord Cecil, the former representative to the League of Nations, spoke, saying that currently, except for Japan, all countries do not want to destroy peace, so the danger of an immediate outbreak of war does not seem to exist, but the concerns mentioned by Pengsonby earlier are indeed justified. The government's remarks are sometimes quite strong and active, but its actions have always been very weak. At this point, Foreign Affairs Second Secretary Stenhope stood up to defend the government, saying that the accusations of the members are not appropriate. England cannot independently make any initiatives on the Manchuria Incident. Although the United States took action alone in January 1932, (referring to the fact that when the Japanese army attacked Jinzhou, the United States sent the same type of note to China and Japan, requesting respect for the Nine-Power Treaty,) but it must be known that the United States does not join the League of Nations, while England is a member of the League of Nations. Since China has appealed to Geneva, England cannot act alone, and the Lytton Investigation Team and the Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Affairs of the League of Nations have not advocated sanctions against Japan, and England is not in a position to disagree. Finally, Stenhope said that the government's recent reply from Japan is considered satisfactory, which is completely correct. The Japanese reply expresses respect for the Nine-Power Treaty and the principle of the Open Door, and England should naturally consider it satisfactory. (7th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A London dispatch stated that Foreign Minister Simon, in response to a question in the House of Commons, stated that "Japan's special rights and interests in China that are recognized by other countries but not shared by other countries" means that if the Japanese oppose any special policies of the British government towards China, or oppose any special activities of the British in China, it must be pointed out that this policy or activity infringes on some special rights and interests of Japan, and that these rights and interests are recognized by other countries but not shared by other countries. (General rights and interests do not belong to this category. Japan, like other countries, has obtained special rights and interests in China through the effectiveness of agreements regarding specific operations, which are recognized by other countries but not shared by other countries, such as the Japanese Concession in Hankou. These agreements cannot be listed one by one now, and there is no need to list them one by one, because the responsibility for distinguishing what is a special right and interest and what is not lies not with the British government.) Simon continued in response to another question that if Japan's desire is only to express opposition to hindering the peace and order of East Asia, then he hopes that all signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty will have the same purpose.

The bay is located in the long strait of Lower California and occupies a strategic position. The newspaper also stated that Mexico has ordered 20 new ships from a Spanish shipyard, which will be completed by the end of this year. (8th National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Establish Air Police to Crack Down on Private Smuggling of Drugs by Aircraft, US Representative Proposes to the League of Nations <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations is currently investigating whether to establish an international air police force to crack down on the illegal transportation of narcotic drugs by aircraft. This case was proposed to the League of Nations by Fuller, the US State Department's opium director and US representative to the League of Nations opium conference. After being approved by the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations, Exeterland, the director of the League of Nations opium department, immediately sought opinions from various governments. Fuller declared to the League of Nations Advisory Committee on Opium that the United States attaches great importance to the use of aircraft to smuggle drugs. The committee also expressed concern as a result. In a letter to various governments, Exeterland asked governments to report to the League of Nations the entire situation of illegal air transportation of drugs in their countries, as well as measures to crack down on it. Based on the reports received, the League of Nations will recommend the establishment of air police to prevent this type of air smuggling. The US representative said that the United States has discovered that a considerable number of drugs are transported by air from Canada. These aircraft are purely privately owned and fly out of Canadian airfields. When taking off, the cargo loaded in the aircraft is legal goods, but in the middle of the journey, they land somewhere, drop illegal goods in, and then fly to a designated location in the United States to unload the goods. The empty aircraft then flies back to Canada along the original route. Therefore, the only way to crack down on it is to use aircraft to patrol. The United States has now established this type of air police in many places. In the first year of its establishment (1932), 35 smuggling aircraft were captured. Most of the smuggled goods were alcohol. In the following year, 30 smuggling aircraft were captured in six months. However, it is extremely difficult to investigate drugs, because smugglers can drop or destroy drugs in the air in advance. However, the amount of drugs seized by the government is still very considerable. Opium experts believe that although a large number of drugs in Europe are smuggled by air, several cases have been seized on commercial aircraft, but so far there is no air police force equipment.

<p>(Paris) Representative and Mayor Haver presented to the House of Representatives a five-year plan for the development of French agriculture, industry and commerce. An Associated Press reporter learned that some major French industries are now considering implementing a plan to manage production and distribution. This type of plan is similar to the National Industrial Recovery Act of the United States and has a validity period of three years or more. Meyer's plan stipulates that the minimum amount of funding within five years is 10,000,000,000 francs. Part of the funding comes from tax revenue, and the remaining part is borrowed from the National Social Insurance Fund. Its purpose is to subsidize export trade, shipbuilding companies and shipping companies, and the government will also use the fund to support agriculture. The French wine industry has been sluggish in recent years, and the government will pay special attention to it. The plan also stipulates the funding for public works in Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco to develop railways and new-style commercial ports. The government will also follow the example of the United States and provide low-interest loans to local governments to develop public works in various places. Meyer believes that his plan is also profitable in itself, because most of the expenses can be compensated by reducing unemployment benefits, and the national tax revenue will inevitably be abundant after the revitalization of industry and commerce. After Congress reopens on May 15, it may discuss this five-year plan, and the Du Mayer government may also draft its own plan. If the government decides to draft its own plan, its content will follow the example of President Roosevelt's revival plan. (8th National News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) Representatives of England, France, the Netherlands, India, and Siam signed an intergovernmental agreement on the implementation of the Rubber Management Plan at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today. At the same time, the House of Commons also discussed the various points of this agreement. Colonial Secretary Lister said that consumers will be asked to appoint representatives to join a group to advise the International Committee on rubber management matters. The British government had discussed this plan with the US government for a long time before it was announced. He felt that the plan was well-considered and sufficient to obtain a reasonable price. The purpose of this plan is not to maintain a standard price. He believes that it is not appropriate to insert a clause stipulating that the entire issue should be reconsidered when the market price exceeds a certain limit. It is impossible to determine what is a reasonable price without considering the world situation and future costs. The members of the Management Committee are actually not appointed by the British government. The government believes that one of the groups representing the interests of consumers can represent the interests of British industry. Labor Party member Groves asked whether the governments of Malaya and Ceylon could be asked to appoint representatives of consumer interests to join the International Committee so that this plan would have harmonious cooperation from all parties. Colonial Secretary Lister replied no. This plan clearly stipulates that the industries concerned can state their opinions. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>

What is currently known is that both England and Italy have stated that they have no direct concern in the dispute between Hejaz and Yemen. There is very little news coming from the war zone. However, the Hejaz army's advance towards Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, is still in accordance with the planned plan, so it is expected that a fierce battle will occur near Sana'a within a day or two. Furthermore, the rumor that the Crown Prince of Yemen has forced his father out and taken on the defense of Sana'a himself has not yet been confirmed.

The authorities of the Central Political School are very willing to support this. After Tan returned to Qinghai, preparations have begun, and it can be launched in the next period.

<p>(Nanjing) Wang Chongzhi, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, said that the major loan for rescuing commerce in Beijing is still under study. It has been found that banks in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and other places have already loaned out a total of seven to eight million yuan. From the perspective of the Beijing market, this amount is not small. With these millions, the circulation of the market is still allowed. However, the money market is still tight, and merchants are still hoping for loans. The reasons for this must be thoroughly investigated. Where has this cash gone, and why can't it circulate? If loans are needed, which industries need them most, and how much is needed? In short, banks take lending as their business, but for the sake of loan safety and rescue effectiveness, they have to be cautious. The Beijing Municipal Government is quite concerned about small businesses and is now planning to find ways to provide relief. Because the capital of the average small business is limited, and the market has been sluggish and business has been weak in recent years, most of their meager capital has been lost. If relief is not provided, the average vendor will have no way to make a living. Therefore, the Municipal Government decided to borrow one to two hundred thousand yuan from the bank and lend it to all small businesses in the city who need relief at low interest, with loan amounts ranging from fifty to one hundred yuan, so that the average small business can truly benefit. The loans will be implemented as soon as they are borrowed. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Beiping Communication: Bai Yunti arrived in Beiping on the 3rd after returning from Mongolia and is scheduled to leave Beiping for Nanjing within a few days. The reporter met with Bai yesterday. According to him, "After arriving in Beiping from Bailingmiao, I visited Chairman He at 3 pm yesterday, reported on the establishment of the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee, and urged him on behalf of the Mongolian people to take office as the Director of the Mongolian Autonomous Guidance. He has agreed to consult with the Central Government and the intention to resign is expected to be dispelled. I originally planned to leave Beiping for Nanjing tomorrow, but I still have official business to discuss with He, so the departure will be postponed. The Mongolian Political Affairs Committee is preparing to establish an office in Nanjing." Bai also spoke at length about the current situation of the Mongolian race, vividly and thoroughly, and recorded its main points as follows: "Mongolia was once a strong and great nation. Its race is distributed on the earth as far as Hungary, Romania, and Central Asia, Siberia, and the north and south of the Gobi Desert in Europe. Unfortunately, they are now mostly under the domination of foreign iron hooves. To the north of Outer Mongolia, that is, the large mountain on the east bank of Lake Baikal, there are about 500,000 Mongolians living there. Geographically, it is called "Buryat Mongolia." As early as the Kangxi and Yongzheng years of the early Qing Dynasty, when China and Russia delineated the border, due to the darkness of the Qing court's diplomats, the land and people north of the Kyakhta trade city were all given to Russia. The more than 2 million Mongolian people in Outer Mongolia are now also receiving assistance from Soviet Russia to train their troops, consolidate their national defense, educate their children, and build their roads in preparation for the outbreak of a Japanese-Russian incident, in which case they will take up arms and fight the Japanese. At present, the Kulun arsenal is in the hands of the Mongolian people, and the manufacturing of military supplies is extremely busy. There are currently 300 airplanes in Outer Mongolia. At the intersection of the Zhangku Highway and the Inner and Outer Mongolia border, a place called Ud, there are 50 fighter planes stationed there, all of which are Mongolian, in case of unforeseen circumstances. Heavy troops are gathered in the eastern part of Outer Mongolia to meet unexpected needs. The cavalry of Outer Mongolia has long been known in history. Once trained, it will be unparalleled in strength. Moreover, since the independence of Outer Mongolia, a conscription system has been adopted. The peacetime force may be too thin, but in the event of war, the whole country will immediately become soldiers. Therefore, it seems impossible for a strong neighbor to try to get involved in Outer Mongolia today. Since the Sino-Russian conflict caused by the Middle-East Railway Incident in 1929, Outer Mongolia has adopted a closed-door policy and set up checkpoints on its eastern, southern, and western borders, strictly prohibiting foreigners from entering. One of its purposes is to prevent the intrusion of Chinese merchants, so that the people of Outer Mongolia can use Russian goods as much as possible. As a result,</p>
<p>Prices in Outer Mongolia are soaring today. For example, one catty of pork is worth two yuan. Therefore, Mongolian-Chinese trade is really a matter that cannot be delayed any longer today. Outer Mongolia is currently adopting a gold standard system. Its currency unit is a silver coin weighing five qian, which is slightly lighter than the national currency. One and a half Mongolian yuan can be exchanged for one national yuan. At present, Mongolian banknotes can be seen circulating in Bailingmiao and other places. In addition to Russia, the government of Outer Mongolia also has a German embassy in Kulun. As for the situation in Inner Mongolia, the three eastern leagues have fallen to Japan. The Japanese road network in Rehe has been completed, and they plan to build a railway directly to Duolun and Chifeng, which are expected to be completed within the year. Their active military construction is really amazing. Everyone knows their desire for Ximeng. As for the news of setting up a radio station in Ximeng and operating in the three western leagues, they are all inaccurate. When I arrived at Bailingmiao, I did not see any Japanese people along the way. As for the matter of setting up a radio station in Ximeng, a radio station was once transported by car to request its establishment, which is true. After being rejected, the station was taken back, and there was no use of force to set up the station. As for the autonomy of western Inner Mongolia, if it is done step by step, it will indeed be a bright road. The work planned by the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee today is to first establish normal schools in each league as the basis for education. Secondly, actively carry out projects such as establishing woolen factories and developing the industry in southern Mongolia. The population of Inner Mongolia is 5 million. The population in the areas not occupied by the Japanese is about 2 million. Among them, about 50-60% are literate. If the domestic politics are clear and bright, all Mongolians are still willing to join the Republic of China to escape the oppression of foreign races. This depends entirely on whether our country has a solution in the future." (6th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">After the Southern Route Army Recaptures Junmenling, It Actively Handles Appeasement and Rehabilitation Work; Ye Jianying's Bandits Launch Two Counterattacks Without Success <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Communication: The Southern Route Army recovered all the important passes of Junmenling on April 22. Li Yangjing inspected the front line on the 25th to handle the appeasement and rehabilitation work of Junmenling, recruit refugees to return to form anti-communist groups, and ordered all armies to rush to build highways connecting Pingyuan, Wuping, and Xunwu counties, with a deadline of completion before June. As for the Red bandits, after Ye Jianying retreated from Junmenling to Luotian Qingxi, they launched a fierce counterattack the next night. Zhu De and Peng Dehuai's bandits also assisted Ye from the two routes of Huichang and Ruijin. Peng Dehuai personally went to Luotian to supervise the battle. However, the defensive works of the Southern Route Army were extremely strong. The bandits attacked every night but were repelled. On the evening of the 26th, Peng and Ye's bandits attacked Junmen again with more than 10,000 troops. Huang Yanzhen's division also defended the dangerous areas. On the morning of the 27th, Li Yangjing received an urgent report from the front line and immediately transferred Huang Zhiwen's division to advance and assist. Luo Tangyan Yingyu's brigade continued to push up to Panggu Pass, and Zeng Youren's tribe advanced from Guikeng to the front of Luotang. At the same time, Chen Jitang telegraphed Wang Zanbin's division in Anyuan to detour to Tianxin and Longdong to attack the communist bandits from the side. Wang's divisions of Su Ling set out on the 29th and arrived at Junmenxu on the 30th to join the front-line operations. At that time, the army and bandits were still fighting fiercely near Junmen. Li Zhenliang and Deng Longguang's divisions were also preparing to join the front lines of Xunwu and Anyuan. The strength of each army was very strong, and the bandits ultimately failed. On the 29th, Li Yangjing convened a military meeting of the tribal chiefs of each division in Jitan. All the division commanders attended and decided that the 7th and 8th divisions would implement the Lianbao Law in accordance with the training and political guidelines for recovering the bandit areas, organize anti-communist groups, handle local autonomy, investigate households, number doorplates, and accept and rehabilitate bandits and communists who have reformed. All captured bandits and communists were transferred to the rear reformation院. At the same time, each regiment of each unit at the front was equipped with a radio station to facilitate military opportunities. According to reconnaissance reports, Zhu De, Lin Biao, Luo Binghui, Xiao Ke, Peng Dehuai and other bandits were divided into three army groups, with no less than tens of thousands of people, and were still trying to attack in full force.

<h3 id="e80">Xue Yue's Troops Capture Longgang in a Bloody Battle and Prepare for Another Major Advance to Directly Attack the Pseudo-Central Area <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Xue Yue's troops of the Sixth Route Army advanced from Yongfeng to Ningtou and Xingguo. In April, after clearing out the bandit nests in Shaxi and Shanggu in southern Yongfeng, they recovered Longgang, where the pseudo-county government was located, on the 26th. Longgang is located in the Yongfeng, Ji'an, Xingguo, and neighboring areas, adjacent to Donggu (i.e., Pingchi County) in the west, and parallel to Xiaopu Wangbei on the right. It is an important road to Xingguo and Ningtou, and the terrain is dangerous, so it is a must for strategists. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, it was once recovered, and then occupied by bandits again. The bandits used this place as a contact base for the junction of western, eastern, and southern Jiangxi, and built solid fortifications, which they valued very much. After Xue's troops captured Shaxi, about five or six thousand soldiers from various pseudo-independent divisions and independent regiments retreated here. In mid-April, a certain division used one brigade as the vanguard and one brigade as a reserve to rush towards Longgang. The pseudo-23rd Division and the pseudo-independent 1st and 2nd regiments were perched around Longgang, occupying dangerous fortress fortifications and stubbornly resisting. Ma's regiment first engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits. From morning to noon, they destroyed more than a dozen bandit fortresses in a row. Before long, they surrounded Longgangxu. Zhou's regiment took the opportunity to attack. Except for a part of the bandits who stubbornly defended the fortress on the large mountain in the south, the rest retreated. Ningtou was completely in the hands of the suppression army. However, the Nanshan fortress stood tall on the extremely high ridge of Fox Mountain, with cliffs on the left and deep valleys on the right, like a natural moat. A certain regiment used one battalion of troops to encircle the fortress and attack upwards, engaging in hand-to-hand combat more than a dozen times, but all failed. More than a dozen artillery shells were used, but they only broke a water tank used by the bandits to store water. The bandits took the opportunity to counterattack, and the soldiers of the suppression army became even more angry and climbed up at the risk of their lives, digging up landmines, destroying bamboo nails and deer fences, and removing obstacles. Dong Jintang, a sergeant of the 3rd company, and Liao Guoqing, a sergeant squad leader of the 6th company, crawled forward in a snake-like manner and rushed to the top of the fortress in the rain of bullets, aiming their bayonets and guarding the gate of the fortress. One of the pseudo-political commissars who was supervising the battle was killed on the spot. His comrades saw it and rushed up, and all the bandits in the fortress were captured alive. Longgang was finally settled. Currently, Xue Yue is actively handling the aftermath of Longgang and preparing to launch a major offensive towards Ningtou and Xingguo. Once Donggu Toubei Yuexi Liangcun is captured, the pseudo-central area can be suppressed from Xingning, and the bandits' interior can be penetrated.</p>

<p>A few days ago, a woman carrying an eight-year-old girl took a long-distance bus from Shanghai to Zhoupu, intending to hire a boat to the east gate of this county. Suddenly, she wanted to jump into the river to commit suicide at the Xuaidi Zhai in Tu 95 on the way. The boatman Lu Asheng stopped her and, accompanied by the clerk there, went to the Tanzhi Qiao Zhen police station. The police station then presented the woman, the girl, 190 yuan in cash, a term deposit certificate from the post office, and miscellaneous clothes to the Xinchang Public Security Fourth Branch for verification. According to the woman, her name was Xia Meiying, she was 32 years old, and her original籍 was Shaoxing. Her husband, Zhang Yunsheng, was from outside the east gate of this county. He used to be a detective in Shanghai. Now she came to the south from the Huilv Hospital on Aiwanyi Road, Beinicheng Bridge, Shanghai. When asked why she wanted to commit suicide, she said that her husband had embezzled money and drove her away, ignoring her alimony, and was addicted to smoking, so there was no hope for the future, so she did this. However, what she said did not seem to be true, and it was probably caused by deep nerve stimulation. The bureau ordered the police to send her to a Xinchang Hotel for temporary rest. The woman went to the bureau again the day before yesterday and claimed that she had a relative named Ren Liyuan who lived at No. 8 Ailin Lane, Xujiahui Road, Xieqiao, Shanghai, Hongyuanfa Stove, and another relative named Xie Dianrong who lived at No. 5 Jimao Lane, Nancang Street, Nanshi, Shanghai, and asked to send letters to inform them that they could solve the affairs of her and her husband, and said that she did not want to live in a hotel and asked to be sent to a nunnery for recuperation. The bureau entrusted someone to send her to the Hongmiao nunnery in Nanshi, the town. Unexpectedly, the woman suddenly used a sharp pair of scissors to cut off her daughter's throat and kill her at about 12 noon yesterday, and then committed suicide with the scissors. The situation was very tragic. The nun in charge of the nunnery, Hua Shengshi, immediately reported the incident to the bureau and then to the county government, requesting that someone be sent to examine the body.</p>

<p>The Minsheng Southern Goods Candy and Biscuit Company on Beida Street was opened with funds raised by Cantonese overseas Chinese, and the Cantonese Wu Zijing was appointed as the manager. Wu was stationed at the Minyou Store outside Ximen, Taicang. Since the company opened last autumn, business has not been very prosperous. At 1 pm on the 7th, County Magistrate Peng Baichuan suddenly received a secret report that the company was hiding red pills, opium, morphine, and other drugs. After receiving the report, Magistrate Peng immediately ordered Police Captain Luo Qixiang and Water Patrol Captain Yang Chunsheng to lead more than a dozen team members to search. For a time, crowds gathered and north-south traffic was blocked. The search lasted for three hours, but nothing was found and they left. When the team members went to the company to search, the company staff first checked the team members' bodies.

<p>The depression of the silk fabric industry in this county has reached its extreme. In addition, last year, Hangzhou merchants came to Yangzhou to organize Dasheng branches. Their competitive selling and chaotic behavior has become increasingly uncontrollable. The Silk Fabric Guild had previously petitioned various agencies to ban them, but the issue has not been fully resolved. Recently, Wang Heqing, seeing that the Hangzhou merchants were able to cause such disruption, also came to Yangzhou to speculate. He specially opened a new Xinji brand at the site of the bankrupt Hongxing store, selling silk and satin foreign goods at auction, which will inevitably cause disputes among competitors.</p>

<p>The Jiaxing rickshaw pullers demanded a reduction in rickshaw rent. Although the party and government mediated, the company did not allow a daily reduction of five cents in rent, and still collected four dimes of silver dollar per day, resulting in a second strike by all rickshaw pullers starting on the 7th. On the 8th, the rickshaws were still not out. Gao Derun, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, specially went to Rufei Rickshaw Company in front of Xuanmiao Temple at 1:00 p.m. to persuade the rickshaw pullers to go out. However, some workers, because the rent reduction issue had not been resolved, prevented them from going out, resulting in a conflict between the two sides. They used iron tools to beat each other, and many rickshaws were destroyed. Rickshaw puller Chen A'da suffered head injuries from iron tools (caused by the shop assistants of Xinyang Ironware Store, which is adjacent to the rickshaw company). Lu A'rong, the owner of a nearby opium shop, was also beaten. Subsequently, the patrol team of the Public Security Bureau arrived and took Chen A'fa, the owner of Rufei Rickshaw Company, rickshaw pullers Ying Xianglian, Hu Jiangao, Wang Xiaolong, Chen A'da, Shen Jinkun, Zhou Ziwen, airport worker Xu Debiao, automobile worker Wang A'yi, and mechanics Chuan Lianggui and Lu Xingsheng, a total of eleven people, to the bureau and transferred them to the local branch court. Chen A'da was seriously injured and was carried to the court for examination. At 4:00 p.m., the Public Security Bureau summoned rickshaw puller representatives Deng Heyi and Chen Jinbiao to the bureau for reprimand. The government also summoned the rickshaw company owner for persuasion. Now the rickshaw company has softened and allowed a reduction of the rickshaw rent to 35 cents per day. The county government has issued a notice to the public, ordering the rickshaw company not to raise the rent and the rickshaw pullers not to instigate strikes, otherwise they will be arrested and dealt with. The matter has come to an end.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Interview with the New Persian Consul <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Advocating Direct Trade between China and Persia</p>
<p>Yesterday's Visit to Mayor Wu and Yu Ming</p>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, Ostovan, the first Persian Consul General to China, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon. Yesterday afternoon, he visited Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Yu Ming, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In an interview with a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency at his residence in Cathay Hotel yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m., Mr. Ostovan said that Persia believes in Islam, but not all Persians believe in Islam, only the aristocracy and officials believe in it. I am also a Muslim. I am 45 years old and have been working in the Persian diplomatic service for 18 years. Before coming to Shanghai, I served as the consul in Karachi, India, for 32 months. This is my first time to China on this mission, and I admire the people, culture, etc. of China very much. I am very honored to have this opportunity to come to Shanghai. My position is that of a consul. In the future, other consuls may be appointed to Beijing, but I am only the consul in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Soon to Enter Beijing <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Ostovan said that the establishment of the consulate is planned to be in the western district of the Public Concession. After finding a suitable location, I will enter Beijing to formally visit the diplomatic authorities of your country. The appointment of myself as the Persian Consul in Shanghai was discussed by the Persian Ambassador to Russia and the Chinese Ambassador to Russia. It is still awaiting the approval of the Nanjing government. After this approval is transferred from Moscow to the Persian government, I can enter Beijing to visit the diplomatic authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Direct Trade <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>There are very few overseas Chinese in Persia, just like there are few Persian overseas Chinese in China. Persia's main imports to China and Persia's main exports to China are not direct imports and exports, and must be transshipped through other countries. Therefore, in order to promote commercial relations between China and Persia, it is necessary to have direct trade. For four hundred years, China and Persia have not sent formal representatives. The sudden dispatch of formal representatives this time is also due to this need, and it cannot be delayed any longer. As for the treaty relationship between China and Persia, a friendship treaty was concluded in Rome in 1920 by the ambassadors of the two countries stationed abroad. After that, it will be necessary to conclude a commercial treaty. As for whether I will be responsible for this negotiation in the future, or whether someone else will be appointed, it is up to the decision of the government authorities.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Ostovan talked about the recent situation in Persia, saying that the Persian government changed on October 31, 1925. On December 13 of the same year, the new government was established, and it has been developing towards construction ever since. Persia is friendly to any country in the world. Persia's main products are many, such as oil, wool, felt, rice, silk, cotton, fruits, etc. The minerals include copper, iron, coal, lead, etc. The currency system used in Persia is also based on gold, named Pahlavi, just like the British gold pound and shilling. Each Pahlavi is equal to one hundred Birls, and each Birls is equal to one hundred Dinars.</p>

<h3 id="e111">China General Chamber of Industry and Commerce Submits to the Ministry to Stabilize Prices <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Set Minimum Price Based on Current Price of Raw Material Wheat</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of stabilizing the market price of flour, the China General Chamber of Industry and Commerce and the Shanghai Flour Industry Association previously submitted a request to the government, proposing urgent steps be taken within a short period of time to stabilize flour prices and relieve the rural areas. After the Ministry accepted the request of the two associations, Liang Shangdong, of the Department of Commerce, was dispatched to Shanghai on the 4th of this month to invite manufacturers to talk. However, their expression was not very clear, so the price of flour plummeted again on the 7th of this month, with a difference of more than a dime before and after, creating an extremely bad environment. The China General Chamber of Industry and Commerce, in view of the principle of stabilization, must be announced within a short period of time, so it once again requested the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for relief yesterday, stating its position and explaining the purpose of setting the minimum flour price. Both the theory and the facts are very sufficient. The principles of setting the minimum flour price that it advocates are recorded below. Regarding the issue of stabilizing the flour price, the association has submitted requests to the Ministry one after another. First, adopt the method used by the US government in 1933 to ban the New York Stock Exchange, first stop the exchange's bidding, so that various securities can gradually return to their original value during this period of suspension. According to the investigation, although the time is temporary, the effect is very significant. However, it is deeply concerned that once this step is implemented, it will inevitably cause other changes in the settlement price in the future, which will make the situation more confusing and lead to more disputes. After research and consideration by most experts, it is agreed that the government's power should be used to set the minimum price based on the current price of raw material wheat, which is relatively stable and easy to implement. Considering the current situation of flour prices, the degree and state of the price drop are not due to any drastic changes in a certain period of time, but a downward trend day by day and hour by hour. Therefore, once the minimum price is determined, it can at least have a considerable effect in the short term. The predicted results are analyzed as follows: (1) The current flour market customers are buying low because the Chinese economy is depressed and the prices of various goods are falling. Considering flour, it is in the same situation, so they only buy short and do not buy long, and over time, it has become a trend of gradual decline. Now, if there is a minimum price limit, it means that the government is expressing its determination to maintain flour prices and at the same time showing its clear behavior and trend. Then, customers will see that it is useless to sell short and will naturally buy low and buy high. For example, on April 27 of this year, the flour market had entered the two-yuan mark. Later, as news of government maintenance continued to spread, the market price gradually rose. By May 5, it had reached as high as two yuan and four cents. However, on the 6th, when the government representative returned to Beijing, it was reported that no definite solution had been reached, so the price plummeted again in one day on the 7th. Comparing the market prices before and after, there is a difference of more than a dime. This is enough to show that the rise and fall of the market price still depend on the market. If there is a force in the middle that can raise the price, it can of course have an effect in the short term. (2) The method of limiting the minimum market price is commonly used by governments in exchanges. Its effect can make the general public change their mentality and change from buying low to buying high. This method can not only increase the number of transactions in the exchange, but also enable the raw material merchants to extend their breathing power and buy a large amount of raw materials, so as to wait for a high price to sell. On the contrary, in the current situation, the flour price is gradually declining day by day, and the grain merchants dare not buy more wheat. However, if the flour price is predicted, no matter what, the flour price will never fall below a certain number, then more wheat can be imported at that time, and flour merchants can also import more flour. The transformation of the environment is that today's buying low is tomorrow's buying more. With the multiplication and evolution, the flour price can immediately go upward. This is the so-called use of the market's buying and selling opportunities to make the price of goods naturally stable.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Merchant Ships: Passenger Overload Prohibited - New Regulations Issued by the Ministry Now in Effect - Navigation Bureau and Customs Cooperate in Inspection <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Ship overloading is most likely to cause accidents. Therefore, regarding restrictions on cargo loading, the Ministry has hired experts to establish a load line method. Similarly, excessive passenger loading also poses significant risks. Recently, the Inspector General of Customs petitioned the Ministry of Finance regarding the difficulty Customs faces in managing passenger overloads on Chinese vessels. The Ministry of Finance has consulted with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and agreed to strictly enforce regulations when navigation authorities issue passenger capacity certificates for inland river vessels. However, because the Navigation Bureau currently only handles inspection, measurement, and registration matters, the issuance of permits and inspection of vessels entering and leaving ports has not yet been implemented. The Customs and Navigation Bureau are now closely cooperating to facilitate their duties, and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications has added new measures: (1) Hereafter, when issuing passenger capacity certificates, the navigation authorities should carefully assess the vessel's hull, machinery, boiler structure, and capabilities to ensure they meet minimum standards. Inspection certificates may be withheld if life-saving equipment is lacking. (2) Passenger-carrying vessels passing through Customs should present their vessel inspection certificate and passenger capacity certificate. If they lack these certificates or if Customs discovers that the number of passengers exceeds the allowed limit, the ship may be detained, and the nearby navigation authorities should be notified for punishment. (3) If, during departure or while en route, military personnel forcibly board a vessel, causing it to exceed its passenger limit, the captain or ship's officers should refuse them. If they are unable to resist due to force, they should report the incident to the local Customs office or the Customs office at the vessel's initial port of call, awaiting further instructions. The above three measures have been communicated to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that they be forwarded to all Customs offices, notifying all shipping companies to comply. After the promulgation of these new measures, the Customs and Navigation Bureau have been jointly conducting strict inspections of passengers on all vessels. Any vessel found to be overloaded will be immediately detained and punished. The Navigation Bureau has already instructed all shipping companies to report the number of passenger seats on each vessel for record-keeping purposes.</p>

<p>The Minsheng Company is a Chinese shipping company operating on the Sichuan River. It has large and small ships such as Minsheng, Minzu, Mingui, Minxian, Minkang, and Minqiang. Since the dissolution of the Sichuan River Alliance Pact with British Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, American Jiejiang, and Italian Yihua companies, and in view of the intense competition for passengers and freight, it has specially organized through transportation tickets to various ports in Sichuan. All non-treaty ports in Sichuan, where foreign ships cannot call, are included, and the facilities of each ship have been improved, and it is responsible for reserving hotels and guiding everything.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Ports on the Sichuan River <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>

Ports below Chongqing: Fuling, Fengdu, Zhongzhou, etc. The above ports are all non-treaty ports, and foreign ships are not allowed to call. Now all the ships of the Chinese Minsheng Company can call. Since the implementation of the through transport, the Mingui ship sailed directly from Shanghai to Chongqing last night, and through transport tickets were also sold at the same time. The Minzu ship is scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to Yichang on the 12th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Finance - Requesting Extension of the Validity Period for Domestic Seafood Permits <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Please Change Everything to One Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "According to a letter from the Shanghai Seafood and Grocery Industry Guild, a member, stating that the Changdexin, Maohe, and Dingyu Yuchang companies, also members, are engaged in domestic goods such as dried clams, wood ear, and shiitake mushrooms. When these goods are shipped from the place of origin to Shanghai, customs duties are paid and a permit is obtained for sale. The validity period is stipulated to be only six months, and the validity period of the dried shrimp permit is also only eight months. If the stock is not sold out within these six or eight months, it must be taxed again if it is to be transferred to other ports. Moreover, the standard of taxation is estimated at market price, which is twice the market price. Moreover, due to the ambiguity of valuation, there are often various difficulties in detention and punishment or tax supplementation. Then, not only are there overlapping tariffs, but also unexpected losses in valuation, which is unbearable and extremely painful. However, the import validity period of the same foreign goods is one year, and within one year, they can be transported and sold without any burden of overlapping taxation and unexpected valuation, so merchants with less capital and a heavy profit-making heart are more willing to promote foreign goods. Patriotic merchants are unexpectedly destroyed, which seems to be contrary to the government's policy of maintaining domestic production. It is reasonable to report the situation to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which will forward it to the Ministry of Finance, requesting the customs regulations. The validity period of the above permit should be changed to one year in order to relieve the burden and revive the merchants' difficulties." The association pointed out that "annual leakage is alarming." The reasons are nothing more than the fact that the people are extravagant in foreign goods, the national production is backward, and the merchants are only interested in profits and are happy to promote foreign goods, which is also quite relevant. Now that the government is maintaining domestic goods and promoting production to save the crisis, it seems that the validity period of the customs permit should be revised to one year in order to maintain the sales of domestic products. It is appropriate to report the situation and request the ministry to review and approve it as requested, which would be publicly appreciated. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully stated that the validity period of the domestic seafood and grocery import permit is only six months, and at most only eight months. After the deadline, the tax must be re-evaluated and taxed. Compared with the one-year foreign permit, the treatment is inevitably very different, and it is inevitable that merchants will tend to favor foreign goods. The industry association's request that the validity period of the domestic seafood and grocery import permit be changed to one year is a legitimate reason, and it is appropriate to report the situation. We respectfully request your ministry's review and approval, and request that the customs be ordered to comply with the processing, which would be publicly appreciated."</p>

<h3 id="e126">Rural Medical Association Cables the Jiangsu Provincial Government - Please Implement the Examination of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quickly <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Provincial Government passed the Regulations on the Examination of Traditional Chinese Medicine, a small number of doctors have requested the provincial government to exempt them from the examination. The Rural Medical Improvement Association of this city believes that the examination of traditional Chinese medicine is sufficient to eliminate the mediocre and select the outstanding, which is very beneficial to the development of medicine. Yesterday (the 8th), it sent a cable to the Jiangsu Provincial Government requesting immediate implementation. The original cable stated (above omitted), "Chinese medicine has the deepest essence, and after thousands of years of social experience, the wise have elucidated it, and it does have considerable treatment skills. However, since the Republic of China, the government has taken a hands-off attitude towards traditional Chinese medicine, exiled in a state of self-reliance and self-destruction in an anarchic state. Therefore, there is no control over practice, and anyone can be a doctor. Pharmacy shop partners, itinerant drug dealers, and transformed Confucian doctors and family doctors, etc., have copied one or two common prescriptions, and have obtained a few jingles, and can hang a pot to save the world, using patients as experimental products. The prestige of medicine has fallen, and the lives of the people have suffered a great deal. The average mortality rate of Jiangsu population accounts for more than 30 per thousand, and this alarming super-high mortality rate, the rampant quack doctors, is the biggest reason. Premature death and ethnic vitality are destroying the social economy, and there is nothing worse than this. At present, there are more than 10,000 quack doctors in Jiangsu province in addition to good doctors. If the examination is not started immediately and prohibited from being produced, it will increase day by day and cause more harm. The regulations on the examination of traditional Chinese medicine, which were previously passed by the provincial government, are indeed tools to eliminate quack doctors and select outstanding ones. We sincerely request immediate implementation to save the people of Jiangsu and improve the status of traditional Chinese medicine. It is a virtue to say so."</p>

<p>Gu Genfa, a local from Shanghai who lives at 151 Pushi Road in the French Concession and runs a car business, is 40 years old this year, and his wife, Zhang, is 39 years old this year. They have three sons and one daughter, and have some assets, which can be warmed and satisfied, causing them to be coveted by bandits. On the afternoon of the 25th of last month, Gu's third son, Renfu, who is 6 years old this year, and his neighbor Yu Fuji's 9-year-old son, Agou, and 6-year-old daughter, Lin Di, were playing in front of the door together. Suddenly, the three children disappeared at the same time and searched everywhere without success. The next day, Yu's children were sent back by the police from the Second District of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. When asked about the bureau and the two children, the children said that they were kidnapped by bandits to the Jumen Road area at that time. The kidnappers gave each of the two children two copper coins and ordered them to go home by themselves, and they abandoned them by the roadside. They took Gu's son Renfu away. The two children of Yu's family lost their way home and cried on the way, calling Papa, and were found by the police, taken to the bureau for questioning, and sent back. Gu Shi knew that the child was kidnapped by bandits, so he reported to the French Concession Police Station and requested investigation. It was difficult to find a clue for a while. On the 2nd of this month, Gu received an anonymous letter stating that the child was kidnapped by Blind Bingsheng, who lived at 30 Yongshunli, Kangti Road. Gu immediately reported the letter to the French Concession Police Station, and Yang, the detective, asked the two children of Yu's family about the kidnapper's appearance. It was said that the kidnapper was indeed blind in one eye. Detective Yang then used the two Yu children as spies to wait at the entrance of Yongshunli. It was not until 5:00 PM on the 6th that they saw the kidnapper enter the alley. After the two children pointed him out, he was arrested and taken to the police station. According to Cao Bingsheng, 52 years old, from Pudong, he admitted to kidnapping the child of Gu and pointed out the hiding place. He had entrusted someone to sell it to a Cantonese in Hongkou, but failed, etc. It was also found that the bandit had committed a kidnapping case before and sneaked back to the concession and had been handled more than ten times. The head of the police ordered to take him into custody to prepare for Cao to be brought the next morning to find the kidnapped child and arrest the accomplices. However, Cao knew that he had committed numerous crimes and was full of evil, and there was no way to escape the crime. Because he was guilty and afraid of the crime, he picked up a small foreign knife in the detention center and used the knife to stab his throat and abdomen twice in the middle of the night in an attempt to commit suicide. Fortunately, the guard found it and took the knife. The injuries were still light, so he reported to the head of the police and sent Cao to Guangci Hospital for treatment. On the one hand, Cao was sent to the Second Special District Court Criminal First Tribunal for trial yesterday. Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, explained the case and requested a postponement. After the defendant recovered from his injury, he was arrested as an accomplice and taken to find the kidnapped child before the trial was held. Judge Ji Changnian then asked Gu Genfa, the plaintiff, and Yang Yilong, the detective in charge of the case, about the kidnapping of the child, and the defendant's detention and injury. The judge then approved the postponement until the 22nd of this month for further trial.</p>

<p>At about 8:00 AM yesterday (the 8th), Tram No. 47 of the Shanghai Chinese Tram Company's Route 3 Circle Road Tram was driving from Xiaoximen to the front of Minli Middle School outside Danganmen. A public bus from Route 3 Circle Road was also driving from Xiaoximen to Danganmen. Because the road there was narrow and there were many cars, it was difficult to avoid for a while, so the tram and the bus collided with each other, causing the right rear wheel of the bus to be stuck in the left front wheel of the tram. The two cars could not drive, and the vehicles that came before and after were blocked from moving forward. Later, the Penglai City Market Photo Studio came to take pictures of the accident vehicles, and then tried to move the stuck vehicles out and report the accident to their respective companies before handling it.</p>

<p>Dechang Taichang two confectioneries in the French Concession's Rue Ming Kuo, founded by a Mr. Liu from Shaoxing, have a total of sixteen apprentices. Among them is Zhao Jingshou, a native of Zhenyi Town, Kunshan County, who is seventeen years old this year. He was introduced to the confectionery last year by Zhao Guanjie to learn the trade. Subsequently, because Jingshou was exceptionally intelligent, he was able to manage a stall on the fifth day of his apprenticeship. As a result, his master treated him differently, showing him much favor. Consequently, besides working in the shop during work hours, the apprentice spent the rest of his time with a volume of supernatural novels, never leaving his side. Unexpectedly, the apprentice suddenly left the shop at around 3 p.m. the day before and has not returned, his whereabouts unknown to this day. The apprentice's parents, upon learning of this situation, were extremely anxious and traveled from their hometown to Shanghai to inquire about their son's disappearance. The shop owner, Mr. Liu, stated that Jingshou had not committed any wrongdoing while in the shop, and that the colleagues in the shop were quite amicable. He didn't know why he had left and not returned. Furthermore, 210 yuan in cash had gone missing from the shop. According to shop colleagues, Jingshou, having been engrossed in supernatural novels for several days, had mentioned wanting to go to a mythical mountain to seek a master and practice the Tao. The parents, having learned of this, are now dispatching people in all directions to search for Jingshou's whereabouts, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Liu Yunfang Secretly Arrests Prostitutes: Three Arrested in the Xiaodongmen Area <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The police authorities in the Chinese-controlled area of the city consider brothels to be a corrupting influence on young people, and a detriment to public morals. Therefore, successive administrations have rigorously prohibited them. Recently, after the French Concession strictly prohibited prostitutes from soliciting customers along the streets, these prostitutes have successively sneaked into the Chinese area. Initially, they solicited travelers and secretly engaged in prostitution in hotels such as the Central and Dongfang around Xiaodongmen. Although the responsible police precinct has arrested and punished them, the prostitutes, driven by livelihood and their madams, continue to solicit customers along the streets such as Xiaodongmen's Rue Ming Kuo. To avoid being arrested, they have pimps acting as lookouts, making arrests difficult. Recently, Liu Yunfang, the chief of the First District, Second Precinct, received a secret order from the police bureau chief to strictly prohibit soliciting customers along the streets and secret prostitution. He ordered Inspector Zhang Panchi to lead plainclothes police to conduct arrests in the district at 9 p.m. the night before. They arrested Zhang Jindi (18 years old, from Suzhou, residing at 3 Taiping Bridge), Bao Ruixiang (18 years old, from Guangdong, residing at 16 Kangjia Lane), and Wang Jinnian (18 years old, from Shaoxing, residing at 140 Huajin Lane), all prostitutes who were soliciting customers along the street in the Xiaodongmen area. They were brought to the precinct for investigation. After interrogation by Chief Liu, it was discovered that the three prostitutes, Zhang Jindi and others, were secretly engaging in prostitution and even dared to solicit customers along the streets, behaving extremely lawlessly. It was decided to hand them over to the General Bureau for strict punishment, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Xinjiang Hui Ethnic Music Troupe Plans to Perform Again in Shanghai <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Ismail and Others Found the Bian Duo Bi-Monthly Publication</p>
<p>Using Both Hui and Han Languages to Communicate Northwest Culture</p>
<p>The Xinjiang Hui ethnic music troupe, which was recently invited to Shanghai to perform by influential figures such as Central Committee members Li Shizeng and Wu Tiecheng, has already seen its members leave Shanghai. However, Professor Ismail and Aisha, a member of the Xinjiang Construction Planning Committee, are currently still here. According to Professor Ismail yesterday, in order to promote the culture of the border regions, in addition to founding the Bian Duo bi-monthly publication, they plan to give another public performance in Shanghai in the near future. Xinjiang is an important part of our country's territory, but our own people seem to be isolated from it. Sometimes we have to rely on foreign writings before we can understand its true reality, which is a shame. Mr. Yi also said that when he was young, he liked the music of the Hui people in Xinjiang and was determined to improve it. However, the result was failure due to the opposition of the Islamic clergy (i.e. Islamic teachers) in Xinjiang and the lack of assistance from local officials in cultural undertakings. Therefore, the music and culture of Xinjiang have not been improved to this day, which is also a matter of regret. Mr. Yi then talked about his experience in coming to the mainland, saying that after this failure, he went to the Soviet Union to do business. In 1931, he was arrested by the Soviet authorities, and in 1932 he was deported to the mainland by the Russian authorities.</p>
<p>In Peiping, he met Zheng Yingsun through Aisha's introduction, and taught Xinjiang music to Zheng and the Northwest Investigation Group, etc.</p>
<p>This time, he went to Beijing because of the Jin Shuren case and to thank Luo Wengan for his visit to Xinjiang to comfort the Hui people, as well as to handle the Bian Duo bi-monthly publication. He was also invited to perform by Central Committee members Chu Minyi, Li Shizeng, and others, for which he was very grateful. He was especially grateful for the hospitality of Li Shizeng and Mei Lanfang, which he will never forget. It is said that Mr. Yi is not only good at music, but also at Hui literature. He has now co-founded a Bian Duo bi-monthly publication in Nanjing with Aisha and others, which specializes in introducing all issues of the border regions to the mainland in both Hui and Han languages, so that the documents of the Northwest and the mainland can be communicated. It is now known that this initiative is highly supported by the government. Soon, Mr. Yi and Aisha will return to Beijing to carry out everything.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the savings department of the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank has created various new savings programs, with excellent methods and solid guarantees. The business is very developed. At the recent third shareholders meeting, in order to enrich the foundation of the department and improve service efficiency, in addition to allocating the past profits of the department to the department's public reserve fund, it was decided to increase the fund by 100,000 yuan. Together with the original fund, the total is 200,000 yuan. Therefore, the department's strength is further enriched. It is also known that the department's accounting is completely independent. The past settlements are all publicly audited by Xu Zuo, an accountant. The bank's directors Wang Yansong, Yu Zuoting, Shen Qinzai, Zhang Danru, Wang Boyuan, Pei Yunqing, Feng Zhongqing, Chen Songyuan, Sun Hegao, Chen Xiaodie, Shou Yicheng, Wang Boying, Chen Ziming, and the general manager, deputy manager, and director of the savings department all bear unlimited responsibility to the department's depositors, with extremely reliable guarantees, which is deeply trusted by people in society. It is heard that in recent months, various deposits in the bank's headquarters and the Hangzhou branch, the Baxianqiao branch, and the Xiaonanmen branch have all increased sharply. The total amount has exceeded more than double the previous settlement. Because the Hangzhou branch is celebrating its opening, special commemorative savings methods have been created, such as fixed deposits in one lump sum, zero deposits in regular installments, and three-benefit income sources. The interest rates are better than usual, and exquisite gifts are given according to the regulations as souvenirs. In recent days, the number of depositors has been enthusiastic, and the staff of the bank's headquarters and branches are very busy.</p>

<p>Rongguang Electric Factory, originally established a manufacturing plant and distribution office on Alcock Road, Yangshupu, Shanghai, and has always used domestic raw materials to produce Rongguang brand, Standard brand, batteries, and transparent lights. It has also recently invented a new type of Rongguang lamp. Recently, due to the increasing development of the factory's business, in order to facilitate the treatment of all sectors of society, a general office was established on the fifth floor of the new Kai Flour Exchange Building in this city. Yesterday was the official opening date of the factory's expanded business and general office. No less than 200 celebrities from all walks of life attended the event. Peng Geng, the manager, He Zhuoren, the assistant manager, Li Xiuzhang, the assistant manager, Wang Kaiding, and all the staff warmly welcomed the guests and led them to visit the factory's various products and the samples of Rongguang lamps and transparent lamps that have been customized by various sectors of society, which were highly praised by the guests.

<h3 id="e141">A Rhyming Dictionary Based on Yiyin Suozi is Published <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Chinese characters have been developed through the six writing principles, and it is already very difficult to arrange and check them. However, if there are only questions about the pronunciation and meaning of a character, there are still books such as the Shuowen Jiezi dictionary and the Ciyuan dictionary that can be used to check and clarify them. Moreover, in recent years, there have been many people who have studied character retrieval, and the method of searching for characters by form is expected to be improved in the future. However, people often encounter the embarrassment of forgetting how to write a character when picking up a pen, so that even if they can say it, they cannot write it out, and there are almost no books that can be used for reference. Li Bingwei of Deyou Girls' School in Beiping, in view of this, gathered 20 to 30 colleagues to study and find a way to solve this difficulty. After spending seven years, they have now compiled a rhyming dictionary, which has been published. The content of the book is based on the order of the phonetic alphabet and the four tones, arranging the order of more than 20,000 Chinese characters, and the annotations are very clear and concise. Anyone who knows the phonetic alphabet can use it to check any character whose writing is unclear. Even those who are illiterate, if they know the phonetic alphabet, can check the writing of any character by themselves. It is truly an excellent tool for unifying the national language and popularizing literacy. Whether or not Chinese people are literate, they all need to purchase this book. The book is divided into two types: Chinese binding and Western binding, exquisitely printed on rice paper, and priced at three yuan. The reduced version is even cheaper, priced at only eight jiao or one yuan and several jiao. Ma Guotong Minshe outside Donghua Gate in Beiping is publishing it, and all major bookstores in various cities are selling it.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Penglai Silver Shop in Nanshi Robbed Yesterday Morning: Robbers All Wore Long Gowns, Robbed More Than 600 Yuan <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Kuang Zhongmou of Liangxi, the owner of Penglai Market in the city, established Penglai Silver Shop in the market on July 1, 1932, because the market is lined with shops and lacks financial institutions to provide financial support, so as to facilitate the deposit and withdrawal of various businesses. Therefore, the clients are all shops in Penglai Market, so the facilities are relatively simple, and the anti-theft methods are especially simple. Only one private gatekeeper is hired to be responsible for guarding. At 9:45 yesterday morning, when the staff had not yet arrived, six or seven robbers suddenly came. They were all wearing long gowns and had local accents. They first disarmed the gatekeeper at the door, pushed him inside, and then forced all the staff into a corner. The robbers then began to search and rob, and the 512 yuan deposited in the early market fell into the hands of the robbers, who strode out. Just as the robbers were about to leave the door, the Mingxing Silk Shop in the market ordered an apprentice to send 55 yuan in cash, and the Qingfu Silver Building ordered an apprentice to send 40 yuan in paper money and 10 yuan in cash. The Qingfu apprentice hid the cash in his pocket, and the two apprentices held the paper money and passbooks in their hands. They happened to pass the robbers, and the 90 yuan in paper money in the hands of the two apprentices was also robbed (the 10 yuan in cash next to the Qingfu apprentice was not robbed). Afterwards, the victims reported the matter to the Second District, Second Precinct for investigation.</p>

<p>After Ms. Gong Yinxia, the wife of the late Qin Lizhai, a colleague of this newspaper, and her three children committed suicide by taking poison, the society was greatly shocked. In particular, Ms. Gong's handwritten long suicide note was sad and poignant, and many people in Shanghai expressed their sympathy. The most worrying thing now is that Mr. Weng Pingfu, after hearing the news in Wuxi, was overwhelmed with grief, and his old illness relapsed. He has been accompanied by his family to Suzhou for recuperation. Qin Lizhai's mother is now living in the residence of her son-in-law in Hanzhou. Relatives and friends are afraid that she will suddenly hear the bad news and be overwhelmed with grief, so they are still trying their best to hide it. Yinxia's father, named Gengchen, once served as a teacher in Haizhou during the Qing Dynasty. Ms. Gong had seven siblings, and Yinxia was the youngest. Her parents loved her more than anything else and personally taught her, so Ms. Gong had a good foundation in Chinese studies. According to Qin's family, the five coffins currently stored at the Xijin Guild Hall will be moved to Wuxi recently and buried in the ancestral tomb. All relatives and friends who came to offer condolences have now mostly left Shanghai and returned to their hometowns.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Dutch East Indies Government Restricts Beer Imports: Sales of Chinese Beer to be Hit Hard <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>According to Ji Zejin, director of the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau,</p>
<p>In order to protect the Javanese liquor industry, the Dutch East Indies government has formulated regulations restricting beer, which came into effect on December 13, 1932. The main points of the regulations are three: (1) Importers who imported beer before 1932 can continue to import, and the amount of imports is based on the amount imported in 1931 and 1932; (2) Those who want to import beer must be approved by the Minister of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce; (3) Beer importers must notify the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce by telegraph before December 20, and send all previous import documents by January 3 of the 23rd year for verification. Since the implementation of the restriction regulations, beer imports have decreased, and Javanese wine sales have gradually increased. Most of the beer shipped from China is Wuwu beer, and sales are also good in the Chinese community. However, the agent's capital is thin, and it only has three or four years of history, which is inferior to Japanese wine. Recently, it has been restricted by the restriction regulations, and Javanese wine sales have been strong. In addition, the Japanese-established winery in Java has been successful, so the sales of Chinese beer will be severely hit due to the price difference.</p>

<p>Shanghai private postal bureaus have been operating for many years. Previously, the Ministry of Communications decided to strictly suppress them on the grounds that the establishment of these bureaus hindered postal services. Although representatives and others repeatedly went to Beijing to petition, they were still not approved. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce had previously telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to postpone the suppression. Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a reply from the Ministry of Communications that the establishment of private postal bureaus could not be postponed, and ordered the Postal Administration Bureau to investigate and strictly implement the order.</p>
<h3 id="e146">A New "East Asia Gold and Silver Night Market Agency" Discovered in This City: Opened on Avenue Joffre Yesterday: Business Starts at 9 PM <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the "East Asia Goods Gold and Silver Night Market Agency," newly established by American jockey V. M. Haimovitieh at 989 Avenue Joffre, next to the Weida Hotel, specializes in bidding on gold and silver prices, as well as trading in American wheat, cotton, rubber, and various stocks. It officially opened last night. The general financial circles in this city are mostly unclear about the nature and content of this type of organization and suspect that it is a disguised exchange. Therefore, Tao Xiaoyuan and Chao Hanqing, brokers of the Goods Exchange, and others have hired lawyers Chao Kun and Chao Jimei to send a five-point letter of inquiry, requesting an immediate response. A reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency has made a special investigation and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Night Market: The office has only one and a half storefronts along the street. Although it is elegantly decorated, the market is small and can only accommodate a dozen or so customers at most. Compared with the large-scale organization of an exchange, it is very different. Its business hours are from 9 pm to 1 am. The scope of business is very broad, such as bidding on gold, silver, rubber, stocks, American cotton, wheat, etc., all of which can be bought and sold at the office. It already has the scale of a budding commodity and gold exchange, but the content and nature are far inferior.</p>
<p>Business Characteristics: The manager of the office is the American V. M. Haimovitieh, a well-known jockey in Shanghai. Its business nature has very special characteristics: (1) The American longitude and latitude are just the opposite of China's. The day and night in China are in the opposite position to the United States. The office's business hours are set in the evening, which is when business is booming in the United States. Transactions and trades between the East and West, and telegram exchanges, can be reached in just 19 minutes. Foreign exchange between the two sides can be entered and exited at that time, without having to wait until the next day for the transaction to be completed. This type of organization is very unique for American foreign exchange; (2) In ordinary exchange trading, one-tenth of the margin must be paid. The office only requires proof of bank deposits to replace the margin, without the need to prepare additional cash to deposit in the exchange. Therefore, the nature of its organization is really questionable. Tao Xiaoyuan and others have already sent letters of inquiry and have also submitted requests to the authorities for investigation. There should be a fair solution, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Yuxing Wheel Collides with Civil Ship: Loss of Ship and Cargo Valued at 2,000 Yuan: The Boatman's Wife Cannot Be Rescued <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Yuxing Wheel of the Zhaoxing Company in this city entered the port yesterday and collided with a rice boat when it reached Lujiazui. The rice boat immediately sank, and the hull and cargo were all submerged. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Rice Boat Collided: The Yuxing Wheel of the Zhaoxing Company came to Shanghai from Xinghua, Fujian this time. At 2 p.m. on the 7th, the Yuxing Wheel sailed into the Wusongkou and reached the Huangpu River. When it was about to reach the Longmao Wharf at Lujiazui, a civil ship loaded with rice and grain suddenly came from south to north. The owner of the Yuxing Wheel hurriedly sounded the whistle to order the rice boat to quickly give way and stop. The boatman of the civil ship continued to move forward. The Yuxing Wheel could not stop in time, and the rice boat crashed head-on into the bow of the Yuxing Wheel, immediately capsizing into the river.</p>
<p>Cargo Lost: After the rice boat was hit, the boatman and others all fell into the water, and the cargo in the boat was also lost. Fortunately, the wharf ferry boats of Longmao Wharf and others came forward to help rescue them, and quickly rescued the boatman and others who fell into the water one by one. However, all the cargo in the boat was lost.</p>
<p>Report to Customs: After the incident, the Yuxing Wheel reported the situation to the company and the Customs Port Affairs Department after the ship was berthed. The boatman of the civil ship that was hit and sunk also reported to the Water Patrol Team. Negotiations for Compensation: The Shanghai North Rice Merchants Association Lianyi has sent a letter to the Zhaoxing Company to negotiate compensation. The original letter reads: "Dear Sir, this is to inform you that Shao Gengen, a boatman from Changshu, loaded 134 shi of white rice from Wang Rixin Rice Shop in Jiashan, and set sail on the 5th of this month. At about 2 p.m. on the 7th, when he arrived opposite the new customs of the Huangpu River, near the patrol boat of the Lujiazui Water Patrol Police Station, Shao's boat was sailing close to the Pudong bank. Suddenly, the Yuxing Wheel of the Zhaoxing Company, which was sailing from north to south along the west bank from the Waibaidu Bridge to the Tongren Wharf, suddenly turned its head and drove straight towards Pudong, without sounding the whistle, and rammed Shao's boat head-on, smashing the boat into two pieces. In addition to Shao himself, there was also Shao's wife, Ms. Qian, 28 years old, and a ten-year-old daughter, as well as a partner named Li Difa, all of whom fell into the water. At that time, the wheel not only did not stop, but also did not rescue them. Fortunately, the water patrol boat was nearby and immediately released the wheel to rescue them. Shao, his daughter, and his partner were rescued, but Shao's wife, Ms. Qian, could not be rescued and must have drowned. In addition to the rear half of the boat that was still floating, the rest was submerged without a trace. The total loss of the boat and cargo is valued at about 2,000 yuan, and his wife, Ms. Qian, was tragically drowned, requesting assistance to negotiate. According to this, the case involves loss of life and loss of ship and cargo, and the circumstances are serious. Based on the facts, the Yuxing Wheel should be fully responsible. Accordingly, we will first inquire with your company about the consolation of the deceased and the issue of compensation, so that we can handle it according to the law. Sincerely, Zhaoxing Wheel Company, Water Patrol Police Station, River Patrol and River Affairs Envoy."</p>
<h3 id="e148">Recent Situation of the Zhabei Ciyou Clinic <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>In order to restore Zhabei's prosperity, promote Ciyou work, and develop the Ciyou experimental area, the Chinese Ciyou Association has rented a large plain-style Western-style house on Xibaoxing Road, Zhabei, the most severely affected area of the war, to establish a Ciyou Clinic. Since its opening last month, the number of patients who responded each day at the beginning was only one or two people, but now it has increased to more than 30 people. In addition, work such as family hygiene in terms of health care, physical examinations, medicated baths, vaccination of smallpox, and injections of vaccine needles are all being actively implemented. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Experts in Charge: The director of the clinic is Dr. Jiang Zhaoju, a doctor of pediatric medicine. The doctors include Mobin, a famous German expert in pediatrics, Dunshike, also a famous German doctor, and Li Weiying, a famous ear, nose, and throat expert in Shanghai. The nurses and other staff are also experienced. A Special Recreation Area Has Been Established: The association has rented a large open space in front of the property from the landlord and plans to establish a Ciyou recreation area. It will be equipped with the necessary game equipment and small families and small cities, etc., so that children can acquire knowledge, morality, and order in the game.</p>
<p>Special Work: During the citywide joint health campaign held by various agencies and organizations in June, the clinic will take the opportunity to carry out special work. The planned projects include the Ciyou Health Exhibition, the Family Health Observation Meeting, and the Public Health Promotion Meeting.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony Pending: The clinic originally planned to formally invite people from all walks of life to participate in the opening ceremony this month. However, since the president Kong Xiangxi and the general manager Xu Jianping went to various provinces in Central China to inspect finance, it is necessary to wait temporarily in order to finalize the date and discuss the plan.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Executive Yuan Strictly Prohibits: Antique Dealers from Smuggling Antiques for Export; Digging Up Ancient Tombs is Prohibited; Preservation Agencies are Established <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Private digging up of ancient tombs violates the ban. The Ministry of Interior has previously issued a notice to local county governments to strictly prohibit it. However, in recent years, antiquities have been discovered in various provinces and cities. After examining the origin of these antiquities, they were either discovered in cellars or dug out of ancient tombs. Antique dealers in various places often sell them to foreigners because they are greedy for profit. The number of antiques smuggled out of the country every year is very large, and Shanghai is the central area of the antique market. Therefore, in order to preserve the relics of the ancestors, the Executive Yuan has decided to establish a Central Antiquities Preservation Committee. In the future, competent authorities will also be established in various provinces and cities, and talented people with rich knowledge will be hired to specialize in research. On the one hand, the Executive Yuan will issue a notice to all provinces and cities to strictly prohibit the excavation of ancient tombs and decide on methods to preserve antiquities, so as not to flow abroad. Academic groups such as the Geological Survey of the Academia Sinica and the Peiping Research Institute should organize the relics of the ancestors for the purpose of scientific work, including the discovered objects of ancient tombs, in accordance with Article 8 of the Antiquities Preservation Law; (2) Antiquities discovered due to natural damage and construction projects should be handled in accordance with Article 7.

<p>Gu Renfa, the former director of the Jiangsu Department of Civil Affairs, transferred Liu Zhuomin, the second branch of the Wuxi Public Security Bureau, despite resistance. Gu accused his wife, Gu Li Shuyun, of being suspected of instigating the matter. At the same time, he also reported to the court that Li had sold official positions. He also dispatched his subordinates to Shanghai to arrest Li Shuyun and her daughter and send them to Wuxi. They were detained in the Wuxi Court. At that time, Li was very angry because she was suddenly wronged. Later, Gu was summoned by the Wuxi Court to question Liu Zhuomin and learned the inside story. He was then allowed to be released on bail by Li's proxy lawyer, Chao Kun, to seek medical treatment in Shanghai. At the same time, Li hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Xiang Xun to jointly sue Gu Renfa for false accusation and accuse Gu of bigamy, together with lawyer Chao Kun. At that time, Gu was asking people to mediate, so Li temporarily did not file the lawsuit. The details were recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that although the case was mediated by someone, Gu had very little sincerity, so there has been no result so far. Therefore, Li formally filed a counter-suit for false accusation with the Wuxi Court on the 4th of this month. As for the bigamy portion, it is planned to file another lawsuit after the end of the false accusation portion. It is now known that the petition has been approved by the court and the court hearing has been scheduled to be held at 2 p.m. on the 12th of this month in the Wuxi Court. At that time, Li Shuyun will go to Wuxi in person to appear in court for confrontation. However, it is known that Gu Renfa has not returned to Shanghai since going to Jiangxi. It is also rumored that Gu has left Jiangxi and gone to Wuhan, so although the Wuxi Court has issued a summons to summon Gu to appear in court at that time, the summons could not be delivered because Gu's whereabouts were secret. However, it has been found that Gu's previous address was in Santiao Lane, Nanjing, so it has been handed over to the Jiangning Local Court for transfer. At the same time, according to Li's side, if Gu fails to appear again, they will request the Wuxi Court to issue an arrest warrant when necessary.</p>

<p>The sanitation affairs of this city have always been contracted by merchants after dividing the districts and establishing offices. Zhabei, Southeast, and other large districts have been handled by old merchants for many years. There has been no change until now, so those who are interested in this have always been disappointed. Recently, the old merchants have been delinquent in paying the payment, and the authorities have revoked their contracts and are recruiting new merchants to take over. Bids will be submitted on the 10th of this month. This bidding is not limited to the minimum amount, and the merchants can fill in the bid price according to the amount they can pay.

<h3 id="e153">Statement from the Postal Savings General Bureau Regarding the Liu Yang Embezzlement Case: Public Funds Due Even if Employees Receive Rebates from Operations; Yang Peichang's Testimony Damages the Reputation of the Postal Savings Bureau <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Former Director-General of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Liu Shufan, Deputy Director-General and Manager of the Shanghai Branch Ren Sida, for using 400,000 yuan of bureau funds to operate public bonds on behalf of Xunji, and former Director-General Yang Jianping for purchasing real estate on Avenue Joffre for 1.2 million taels and embezzling 150,000 taels, these two cases have been prosecuted by the Special District Court of this port. According to Liu Shufan's confession, operating public bonds was done on behalf of the former Minister of Communications Wang Boqun. Ren Sida confessed that he acted entirely on Liu's orders. Yang Peichang, an employee during Yang Jianping's tenure, confessed that the 150,000 taels were legitimate commissions, his words were ambiguous, causing general suspicion. A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency specifically went to the Postal Savings General Bureau on Fourth Road yesterday to inquire. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the bureau has been operating quite successfully since its establishment in the 19th year of the Republic, and its credit has become increasingly stable. Unexpectedly, both former directors-general have had incidents, which is truly regrettable. However, their illegal acts were investigated and reported by the Ministry of Communications last spring, and the court handled them according to law, which shows that the government pays attention to the savings and remittance business at all times. In the past year, government supervision has become stricter, and no incidents will be allowed to happen again, so that the interests of all depositors can be guaranteed, and the government's credit will become more stable, etc. The reporter further inquired whether the confessions of Liu, Ren, and Yang were consistent with the bureau's job responsibilities. It was said that since the matter has been prosecuted by the court, the truth will soon come out. Liu and Ren's confessions only seek to shirk responsibility and blame others, and the public will have its own judgment. As for Yang Peichang's statement that 150,000 taels were legitimate commissions, it really damages the reputation of the bureau. It should be known that the bureau is a state agency, and employees all have fixed salaries. Even if there are discounts in business operations, they should be handed over to the public, how can they enrich their own pockets? According to his confession, it is sufficient proof of embezzlement. (Shen Shi News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e154">Does the Owner Assume Responsibility for the Through Freight Transportation Method? Whether or Not Escorts Are Needed Depends on the Nature of the Goods; The Railway Department's Through Transportation Office Sent a Letter to the Two Railway Bureaus Yesterday to Comply <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Two Railway Bureaus received a letter from the Through Transportation Office yesterday, saying, "Approved the telegram from the Longhai Railway Car Affairs Office stating that on the 9th of this month, two cars of gasoline, No. 6066 and No. 4951, were shipped from Rihui Port in Xuzhou to Tongguan, with freight tickets No. 9244 and No. 0344. The stationmaster of Xuzhou Station of this railway telegraphed Jinpu and Jinghu after seeing that there were no escorts to take care of the goods, and then telegraphed to request accommodation, etc. In order to avoid wasting vehicles, this railway specially approved the receipt of the goods. However, in the future, should the through freight goods for which the owner is responsible be accepted if there are no escorts to accompany them? If an accident occurs in transit after acceptance, how should it be handled? I hope for instructions, etc." After arriving at the office, it was found that whether or not the through freight goods for which the owner is responsible need to be escorted depends on the nature of the goods. For example, live poultry and livestock, explosives, flammable liquids, gold and silver, and other valuables, as well as coal and other items, should be watched at all times to avoid damage or theft. When requesting through transportation, inquiries must be made in advance, and tickets can only be issued if there are escorts. As for other ordinary goods for which transportation is not responsible, such as earth and stone, etc., which are not easily stolen, if the owner can trust the railway and does not send escorts, the through transportation routes may allocate and receive the goods to facilitate business and benefit merchants. The previous reasons for the telegram have been approved. In addition to sending separate letters to each route, a corresponding letter is sent to request compliance." The bureau has already instructed the Car Affairs Office to comply.</p>

Recently, it was discovered that Zhang was hiding at No. 24, Lane 310, Tangshan Road, Hongkou. Therefore, the report was made to the General Inspection Office of the General Police Department the day before yesterday to request assistance. The Chinese detectives Liu Shaokui and Chen Yonggui, together with the security department detectives, secretly went to the address, arrested Zhang, and took him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the situation and stated that according to the agreement, those who request transfer of custody from non-modern courts must provide sufficient evidence. Since the requester is a military agency, evidence must be provided before the police can agree, etc. After Judge Feng questioned Zhang, he ordered him to be returned to custody for a later date, pending the security department's provision of evidence before a decision is made.</p>

<p>At about 5 pm on the 7th, a young man of about 20 years old went to the beach in front of the Fuzhi Western Restaurant in Wusong Paotai Bay and jumped into the sea to commit suicide. It was dusk, and the tourists on the beach had dispersed. Only a villager caught a glimpse of him and tried to rush to his rescue, but he had disappeared. So he rushed to report to the 2nd detachment of the 7th district. The police chief immediately rushed to the beach to investigate. On the beach, he found the belongings left by the suicide victim and took them to the 7th District Public Security Bureau. After inspecting them, Director Yao found a dog racing magazine, a business card with the words "Gongji Kitchen, Lane 305, Dabu Street, Xinkaihe Road, Republic Road", and a piece of Western paper with two suicide notes written in red ink, one to his parents and one to his sister and brothers. The text had many typos. The original letter is copied as follows (not changing a single character): "Dear parents, these are my last few words. Although I have spent this little money this time, it is very difficult to raise funds in this economic downturn. So I spent a whole day yesterday without any results. I want to make a big mistake, and I have no face to see you again, and my reputation is spreading. Therefore, I will commit suicide to serve as the guest of the River God. The kindness of raising me will be repaid in the next life. Please don't take it to heart, otherwise, I will not be able to rest in peace underground. I wish you good health and a long life. Underneath, Qian Qikun's last words." "To my sisters and brothers, you must treat your parents well and persuade them on my behalf. It is not in vain to be compatriots. Thousands of words, I want to say but can't finish. Take care of yourselves. Qikun." According to this, the reason for his suicide can also be imagined from his belongings.</p>

On the 21st of last month at 5 pm, Xia was arrested and sent to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law.

After the previous case files were retrieved and the two convicts Yuan and Fan were brought to court for confrontation with Xia, the trial was declared closed. Yesterday was the day of sentencing. The police escorted Xia to the court at 10:30 am.

Now, the association has compiled and printed the first year's "Directory of Clearing Houses," which details the work of the past year, the organization of the association, various regulations and rules, and important resolutions, the exchange bank holiday table, and the clearing house number, address, and telephone number of the exchange bank (with affiliated branches and entrusted banks), etc. There are also many colored statistical charts, and there are several phototype exchange scenes and exchange situation photos at the beginning of the volume. The entire book is printed on domestic paper, the printing is exquisite, and the content is rich. In particular, the attached statistical charts are clearly drawn and are quite important for the financial and commercial aspects. In foreign countries such as Europe, the United States, and Japan, there are annual exchanges, and the organization of the Clearing House in China, which is responsible for the report and the compilation of exchange statistics, is a pioneering undertaking. This kind of publication of the association is the first time that it has been published, and it is particularly valuable. It is learned that the association has set the printing of more than 1,000 copies of the book and distributed them to the banking industry and academic groups in this and other cities for reference.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Special Report: Overview of the Work of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration in the First Quarter of the 23rd Year (5) <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>(5) Refurbishing equipment, manufacturing trains for through service to Beijing, renovating carriages, improving passenger car facilities, vehicle standard meeting, expanding track and engineering equipment, dredging docks and harbor channels.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Manufacturing Trains for Through Service to Beijing <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Since the commencement of through train service between Shanghai and Beijing, this railway was supposed to prepare a passenger train. However, due to the lack of one lounge car, one dining car, and two second-class sleeping cars, they have not yet been added. The Wusong Machine Factory was urged to expedite manufacturing, while the vehicles scheduled for allocation were extensively renovated. The project was completed and test-run on February 20th. The train consists of one first-class sleeping car, one first-class lounge car, two second-class sleeping cars, one dining car, three third-class passenger cars, one guard's car, one heating and postal car, and can accommodate 384 passengers, with 52 sleeper berths. The dining car can accommodate 36 people dining simultaneously. The total cost of renovation and manufacturing reached 177,000 yuan. On the 22nd, the train was parked at the Shanghai North Station to invite people from all walks of life to visit. As the Bureau was then engaged in formulating passenger car standards, and this through train had not yet been manufactured according to the standards, it was naturally not completely satisfactory. This was a good opportunity to solicit criticism from all parties, so as to serve as a reference for determining passenger car standards in the future. The actual operation started on the 25th, and the order of the train was revised after considering and adapting to needs.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Renovating Carriages <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the renovation of other passenger cars, during this quarter, two third-class passenger cars with straight seating were converted into transverse seating, fifteen 25-ton wooden tarpaulin cars were converted into steel tarpaulin cars, and two third-class baggage-brakeman cars were converted into heating-baggage-mail-brakeman cars.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Improving Passenger Car Facilities <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>As for passenger car facilities, on the one hand, it concerns appearances, and on the other hand, it is related to passenger comfort. In addition to actively discussing standards, the following treatment measures were also introduced: (1) Repaint all cars with old colors, and ensure the color of each train is consistent, whether new or old, light or dark. (2) The air in the cars must be kept clean, so there should be adequate ventilation equipment. Third and fourth-class cars are crowded, so equipment should be installed as soon as possible for those that lack it. (3) The toilet facilities in all classes of passenger cars should uniformly use porcelain. (4) The lighting in the cars should be sufficient. The lighting in third and fourth-class cars is too dim and should be increased. (5) The heating in third and fourth-class cars in winter should be similar to that in first-class cars. (6) Clothing hooks, etc., should be installed in cars where they are lacking. (7) Third and fourth-class cars have a large number of passengers, so fans should be installed in summer to improve hygiene. (8) The dining car kitchen should be equipped with electric ventilators to prevent odors from spreading. Because the railway's operating income is mainly derived from third and fourth-class passenger transportation, special attention should be paid to the treatment of third and fourth-class passengers. Therefore, the Mechanical and Rolling Stock Department and the Traffic Department were ordered to complete the above-mentioned improvements as soon as possible to benefit travelers.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Vehicle Standard Meeting <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the determination of standards for each class of passenger car, the relevant personnel were convened during this quarter to hold a vehicle standard meeting. In addition to adopting reversible seat backs for first-class passenger cars and attaching dining cars to passenger trains (except for local trains) as a principle, and using domestic goods as a principle for materials, a comprehensive opinion on improving equipment was also proposed and is currently under strict review.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Expanding Track Engineering <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The new projects completed during this quarter include the northern end of the marshalling yard connecting the Nanjing Riverside Station and the Nanjing Qi Station, with a total length of 565 meters, and the connecting line between this track and the first side track of the Capital Railway Ferry, with a total length of 264 meters, for use by the ferry station and locomotives for shunting. In addition, a storage shed was added to Shanghai North Station to accommodate the Beijing-Shanghai through train. The projects under construction include the addition of shunting tracks at the Nanxiang Station, Qiaotouzhen Station, and Hepingmen Station on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, and at the Nanxingqiao Station and Jianqiao Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. Earthwork is currently being laid, and the required steel rails are also being purchased. To prevent traffic accidents, warning signs prohibiting villagers from crossing the track have already been posted along the line. Recently, 500 new warning signs prohibiting cattle and carts from entering the railway area have been produced, with drawings of cattle and carts to make them more eye-catching. They are being distributed by the Engineering Department to various sections for hanging, including 150 each for the Jingdan and Dansong sections of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, 100 for the Shanghai-Hangzhou section, 20 for the Cao-Ningbo section, and the remaining 80 for future additions and replacements. Dredging Docks and Harbor Channels</p>
<p>In addition, to facilitate cargo lighterage, the coal docks at Nanjing Riverside and the waterways near the Zhenjiang docks, which have shown signs of silting, were deepened. The former was contracted by Gao Yu Ji, with a labor cost of one yuan and forty cents per 2.8317 cubic meters (i.e., one cubic foot). The latter was contracted by Wang Rong Ji at three jiao per cubic meter. Later, Wang Rong Ji applied to withdraw the bid, and it was reassigned to the second-highest bidder, Zhenli Construction Company, which is currently carrying out the work.</p>
<p>(6) Training police officers, admonishing passenger car service employees, training attendants on trains.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Continuing to Recruit Police Recruits <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Railway police serve the railway and should have appropriate training and knowledge. Therefore, the Bureau has established a police training institute to train them independently. The fourth class of police recruits graduated last year and were assigned to various departments to serve. However, the railway line is very long and difficult to defend. To strengthen the police force, the Bureau, together with the Railway Police Administration, requested and obtained approval from the Ministry of Railways to continue recruiting 60 police recruits for the fifth class and to fill the remaining 11 vacancies from the fourth class, for a total of 71 recruits. Examinations were held at the Nanjing Zhakou on February 21st. If the quota is met, classes will begin on the 26th.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Admonishing Passenger Car Service Employees <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Railway operations are based on passengers and merchants. As far as this railway is concerned, passenger transport is even more important than freight transport. Therefore, the behavior of service personnel on passenger trains deserves attention. Therefore, a book of admonitions was printed and distributed, listing four major requirements for service: (1) Maintaining cleanliness; (2) Obeying discipline; (3) Treating guests with courtesy; (4) Disciplining oneself strictly, and providing detailed items to follow.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Training Attendants on Trains <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>As for the attendants in sleeping cars, dining cars, and official cars, they are generally poorly educated. If their character is bad, it is difficult to manage them, and dereliction of duty and slow service to guests will follow. Therefore, training methods have been established. First, when selecting them, attention should be paid to whether their physique is strong and lively and whether their responses are fluent and refined. After selection, it is stipulated that each group of attendants should be rotated to the Traffic Department office on their rest days for training. The subjects are mainly civic morality, hygiene knowledge, and service details. When inspectors board the train for inspection, they also provide individual guidance and conduct examinations. If they do not fully understand the items taught, they are explained in detail. At the same time, strict attention is paid to the matters that attendants should pay attention to when serving on the train. Those who violate the regulations will be punished immediately, so as to cultivate their good character and become excellent public service personnel.</p>
<p>(7) Repaying debts, increasing the reserve ratio, repaying advances for purchasing vehicles, repaying Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway debts.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Increasing the Reserve Ratio <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Bureau's repayment of the Sino-British Bank debt is made by setting aside a special reserve from the daily operating income to meet the payment. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway's set aside percentage has been gradually increased to 20%. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway originally set aside 5%. From October 1st of last year, it was increased to 7.5%. From January 1st of this year, it was increased to 10%. The two railways set aside a total of approximately 200,000 yuan per month.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Repaying Advances for Purchasing Vehicles <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The first and second installments of the principal of the advance for purchasing vehicles borrowed by the Beijing-Shanghai Railway from the Sino-British Bank have been repaid last year. The third installment of the principal of £9,000, which was due in January of this year, was repaid in half in February, amounting to 65,954.20 yuan in national currency. The remaining half was repaid in March, amounting to 65,207.55 yuan in national currency. The total amount of 131,161.75 yuan was withdrawn from the above-mentioned special reserve.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Repaying Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Debts <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway's debt to the Sino-British Bank has been repaid in 30 installments. The 31st installment of the principal, which was due in November of last year, including bank commissions, totaled £37,593 and 15 shillings. Part of it, £19,500, was repaid in February of this year, amounting to 286,896.55 yuan in national currency. In addition to the 167,500 yuan allocated by the Ministry of Railways, the remainder was also withdrawn from the reserve.</p>
<p>In total, 418,058.30 yuan in Sino-British Bank debts were repaid this quarter. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e183">Reading and Answering Questions: Answering the Questions of Readers after Reading "The Quarterly Journal of Labor Problems" <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>To the questioning reporter:</p>
<p>When I read the advertisement for the Labor Quarterly in Shen Bao, I thought of buying a copy for the library. After reading the questions and answers on April 29th and 30th, I mustered the courage to spend five jiao on postage. After the book arrived, I read it all at once. I couldn't help but write down some opinions and ask for guidance.</p>
<p>The content of the publication, as Mr. Wang said, is only a relatively progressive publication discussing labor issues. There are many imperfections, which cannot be listed in detail here. However, reading Mr. Wang's questions, it seems that he is pointing out the contradiction between the previous and later claims of the publication, as if what was right before is wrong later, and what is right later is wrong before. The two must be one or the other. My opinion is slightly different. To put it bluntly, both are right. Simply because the author of the article "A Review and Significance of the Shanghai Workers' Movement" wrote in a clumsy style, which may have caused Mr. Wang's doubts and the criticism of Mr. and someone else. Please elaborate.</p>
<p>It is an iron law that the national bourgeoisie in colonies and semi-colonies has compradore characteristics. These national capitalists are raised by imperialists and exploited by them at the same time. They can only try their best to compensate from the laboring masses of their own country to protect themselves. This point has been made very clear by Mr. citing the example of India.</p>
<p>However, what kind of attitude should the laboring masses in semi-colonies take towards their own national capitalists? Especially in China, which is backward and needs to move towards state capitalism in a period of transition, what is the most reasonable way to do it?</p>
<p>I would like to raise this question to Mr. for an answer.</p>
<p>I believe that what Mr. Liyan said, "The national labor-capital struggle is often 'more intense than' the ordinary labor-capital struggle," does not "hide" the meaning that "workers would rather be family slaves," but is a conclusion drawn from the facts of the "May 30th" incident and other facts. The reason why it is more intense is precisely because it has economic and political "duality." How can there be the slightest meaning of "wanting to eliminate the workers' rebellious emotions in beautiful words and then abolish the national revolution"? Looking at Mr. Liyan's full text again, it only shows that Chinese workers, especially Shanghai workers, are standing on the front line of anti-imperialism, so there is a conclusion of "main force." According to Mr.'s meaning, the workers are "extremely insufficient," who is enough? Warlords? Intellectuals? National capitalists? Backward peasants?</p>
<p>As for the fifth item of the conclusion, the first half already contains many things "implied beyond words." "And..." Below, in terms of writing, it is a big mistake. However, in a semi-colony with backward industries, the working masses have not yet concentrated into a revolutionary period that can erupt victoriously. The result of the recession only makes some factories close and thousands of workers are laid off. We are just enough to know from the little information contained in the publication! Are the yarn mills in Tianjin, Shanghai, Zhengzhou, Hankou, and Nantong, and the silk mills and silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang all real evidence? Was the outbreak of the Shanghai silk factory strike last year the result of a more severe recession? Or was it a stimulus from the improvement of the silk industry? When all the silk factories stopped at the end of last year and the workers were waiting at home, could a major strike occur? Is this a "brilliant theory"? Or is it a fact? Don't be a prisoner of formal logic!</p>
<p>It is true that the "January 28th" incident stimulated the revolutionary emotions of the workers. However, on the one hand, many factories closed down or were destroyed by artillery fire, and the workers were displaced, leading to a decline in the labor movement. This is at least one aspect of the fact! Of course, the workers' inner anger has risen. However, as in Russia after the 1905-1907 revolution, was the temporary decline of the workers' movement not also a fact? Moreover, the author did not say that this was the only reason! This article has problems. Clumsy writing is one of them, and some of it may be to avoid something.</p>
<p>I have written hundreds of words above in a jumble, and I respectfully ask for corrections.</p>
<p>Liu Zili, Zhijiang College, May 6th</p>
<p>We respect Mr. Liu's opinions and hereby publish the above "questions" for the study of readers who are concerned about labor issues. Regarding the evaluation of the Quarterly Journal of Labor Problems, we do not completely agree with Mr. Wang's words, but we cannot agree with Mr. Liu's statement that "both are right." The value of the publication is for the publication itself to explain, and we do not want to waste words.</p>
<p>Now we will answer Mr. Liu's questions.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu asked, "What kind of attitude should the laboring masses in semi-colonies take towards their own national capitalists?" The answer is very simple: In the sense of economic struggle, the semi-colonial workers treat their own national capitalists in no way differently from the imperialist factory owners, nor should there be any difference. They are both the objects of the working class struggle, but in the political sense, it is not the case. If the national capitalist class is standing on the true anti-imperialist position, the working class supports the national capitalist class and forms an anti-imperialist alliance. Conversely, if the national bourgeoisie does not oppose imperialism and they become an obstacle to national liberation, then they are also opposed in politics. Thus, anti-imperialism and anti-native capital are mixed into a single object of struggle.</p>
<p>Taking the sentence "The national labor-capital struggle is often more intense than the ordinary labor-capital struggle" in isolation, it can naturally be said that it does not hide anything. However, if we go on to explain that this is why the Shanghai workers can act as the main force of the nation, this kind of flattery clearly comes from the condition that the workers' "resistance to domestic capitalists is relatively mild." This cannot but contain an incorrect meaning, so we believe that our reply to Mr. Wang is still correct. As for Mr. Liu's saying: "According to Mr.'s meaning, the workers are not enough, who is enough? Warlords?" We deeply regret Mr. Liu. Mr. Liu did not read a sentence thoroughly, and then carelessly raised a protest. It is a pity for Mr. Liu. This "extremely insufficient" clearly refers to the author of the article explaining that this is not enough for Shanghai workers to be the main force of the nation because "the national labor-capital struggle is often more intense than the ordinary labor-capital struggle," but Mr. Liu did not see it, which is somewhat close to intentional sophistry. Who is the prisoner of formal logic after all?</p>
<p>For the fifth item of the conclusion, we believe that the words we quoted are correct. Although the result of "recession" is on the one hand the closure of factories and unemployment, on the other hand, it is not what Mr. Liu imagined: "When workers are waiting at home, can a major strike occur?" We especially believe that if Mr. Liu intends to study labor issues, he should pay attention to reality and look at the recent riots in Paris, street fighting in Vienna, and the disturbances of the London hunger marchers. Is the great strike in the United States stimulated by the improvement of capitalism? Or is it the result of economic recession? Even in China, this year is the most profound year of recession. The current labor unrest in China is also unprecedented since the May 30th Movement. Recently, a factory in Shanghai burned down, and the improvement of the industry is also enough to stimulate the labor counterattack, but the performance of this period is mostly limited to economic significance, unlike the resolute battle driven by hunger, which contains a strong political meaning. Mr. Liu can remember well the stimulus of industrial improvement to labor, but he forgot that under the recession, there are more scenes that drive workers into the Paris bloodshed. This is also a pity.</p>
<p>"After the 1905-1907 Russian Revolution, the "temporary decline" of the workers' movement is a fact. On the one hand, it was because Russia entered the era of great reaction at that time, and the political oppression made the fragile Russian labor movement have to temporarily decline. At the same time, it was also because of the division of the Russian Social Democratic Party at that time, which lost strong leadership. Today is no longer the era of 1905-1907, and the old tune cannot be sung again. We don't want to use words here to argue about the current labor situation in China. We want to ask Mr. Liu to look at the current development of facts. Don't just look at the surface, but observe in depth.</p>
<p>In short: The article "A Review and Significance of the Shanghai Workers' Movement" is not only a problem with writing, but also a theoretical error and a distorted explanation, which has a bad influence on general readers. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e184">Records of Lingering Fragrance <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In the current National Government of China, or in the 　 country, or in other countries, a person who serves as Minister of Internal Affairs or an equivalent position always holds a very important political status; however, the Qing Shan that we are discussing here is different. The matters he handles are all trivial and very minor. So, to put it precisely, he is really equivalent to a servant or butler in a wealthy family. His "internal affairs" are actually "palace affairs." And the difference between his position and other ministers is only that he is more often in the palace near the Empress Dowager than others. If, on the right occasion, the Empress Dowager happens to want to use him, she will have him do some miscellaneous tasks nearby; in this way, he can also take the opportunity to curry favor.</p>
<p>No matter how mediocre his talent is, no matter how unimportant his position is, his attire is indeed very exquisite! In this chapter of the book, the main point that the author wants to describe is the attire of these ministers. Their attire is all in accordance with the standard, as neat as a uniform. As usual, Qing Shan also wore a small umbrella-style cap, with a red coral bead on the top of the cap; in the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the red bead was the symbol of a first-rank minister, and it was extremely valuable! There was also a peacock feather trailing behind the cap. When his head swayed, there were often dazzling lights flashing. Of course, he could not use a "double-eyed" feather, because this kind of feather was the most glorious decoration, and it was absolutely forbidden to abuse it without the permission of the court. In the three hundred years of the Qing Dynasty, only three or four people were able to obtain this special reward. One of them was the famous Hefei Li Hongzhang. (29)</p>
<h3 id="e185">Chess <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Yizhen</p>
<p>Chess is the most common entertainment in our China. Ordinary people know how to play, what jumping horses, flying elephants, drawing cars, promoting pawns, righteous scholars...</p>
<p>...used very quickly.</p>
<p>The meaning of playing chess is inevitably to kill time and relieve boredom, but it is also a good way to exercise thinking.</p>
<p>I remember once when I returned to my hometown from Shanghai, sitting opposite me was an Englishman. After the car passed Longhua, he took out a beautiful set of chess and strongly invited me to play. He was actually very skilled in this set. He said, "Chinese mahjong and chess are indeed great inventions. This thing is also very popular in our England. When playing chess, thoughts are silent and the spirit is united." The words were well said, and I replied at the time: "Yes, your playing cards are also a great invention!" Both of them laughed.</p>
<p>Originally, chess was a noble toy listed as one of the "qinqi calligraphy and painting". Now, old guns have made a set of fir wood, set up a tripod, and are actually doing business on the side of the road, which is too insulting to the chess pieces.</p>

<p>— Zuichisheng</p>
<p>The other day I read the "Qifeng Louzhu" circular nouns in this publication, which were quite interesting. It is based on two words that are repeatedly chanted, and the explanation of their meaning is very different. However, there are many like this: I will re-record several items as far as I can remember, just to make up for the shortcomings.</p>
<p>(London) The capital of the United States. (Dunlun) The relationship between husband and wife is called Dunlun. This is a term set by former moralists. (Subordinates) Military and political officers call their subordinates subordinates. (Lower body) The private parts of the human body are called lower body. I still remember that in the late Qing Dynasty, a military officer submitted a memorial. There was a sentence in it: "The subordinates are still elite and available." The two words subordinates were reversed and written as "The lower body is still elite and available." It was passed on as a joke for a while. (Water moon) The moon in the water, that is, the so-called mirror flower and water moon, is a metaphor for its illusion. (Moon water) That is, women's menstruation, also known as moon water. (Gold) It is the most cherished thing in the world. (Golden) A color name. (Japan) It is called the hegemon of East Asia and the neighboring country that invaded our Northeast. (Today) Today. (Big boss) An important person who holds the great power of national politics. (Oldest) Boatmen call their headman the oldest. Also, the store manager is commonly called the oldest. (Green stone) A kind of rock. (Shiqing) A pigment name. (Shadou) The name of a bean. (Dou Sha) Made of red beans. There are also two words that are read upside down, and their meanings are still the same and can be used in general. I also remember a few items!</p>
<p>(Official) (Official) (Brother) (Brother) (Introduction) (Introduction) (Shanghai) (On the sea) (Yesterday) (The day before yesterday) (Kangjian) (Health) (Love) (Love) (Law) (Law) (Important) (Important) (Processing) (Management) (Hospitality) (Response) (Meeting) (Communication) (Feelings) (Face) (Affair) (Matter) (Painting) (Drawing) (Lively) (Lively) (Friend) (Friend)</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 28: A Coincidence at the Theater, Infatuation Over a Handkerchief, Earnest Inquiries About Illness, a Misunderstanding Leads to a Letter</p>
<p>Ji-zhi thought about it and felt very uneasy. If he recovered from his illness, how would he answer his brother and sister-in-law's questioning? As he thought, he suddenly changed his mind. He was already living independently and not dependent on his brother and sister-in-law. They might not be able to interfere with his personal actions. If they really asked, he could just say it was his girlfriend's handkerchief, which wouldn't be a problem. Wasn't a girlfriend exactly what an unmarried man should want? With this change of thought, he felt justified. Therefore, he stopped worrying about where the handkerchief had gone. In fact, the handkerchief had not caught the attention of the person inside the gate. Two hours before he regained consciousness, the news had already been passed back to the handkerchief's original owner. It turned out that the play yesterday not only caused Gan Jizhi to catch a cold, but also affected Gui Zhi, who was pregnant, causing her to experience a threatened miscarriage. So, the next morning, Zhao Weng invited Wang, a famous Chinese medicine doctor from Haitien Street, to see her. Doctor Wang usually liked to play chess, and so did Zhao Weng. They were chess friends. After taking the pulse, Dr. Wang chatted with Zhao Weng in the main room. Dr. Wang chuckled and said, "During these times of year, doctors are always busy because people eat the wrong things." Zhao Weng said, "Dr. Wang, you just saw Mr. Gan from across the street. Did he also eat the wrong things?" Dr. Wang said, "Probably. He probably ate too much and caught a cold. Sigh! Young people these days don't care about anything, even when they're on their deathbeds, they still want to be in love." Zhao Weng said, "Are you talking about Mr. Gan?" Dr. Wang said, "Who else? He has such a bad cold, and he still keeps a woman's handkerchief under his pillow." Zhao Weng laughed, "How do you know it's a woman's handkerchief?" (380)</p>
<p>, can be used as filling. (Spoken Dialogue) Dialogue in drama and ballad singing.</p>
<p>(Spoken Dialogue) Talking is useless, commonly known as "talking in vain." (Harmony) Conforming to the sound of others. (Mediation) Meaning reconciliation. (Republic) Meaning a democratic country. (Citizen) Common term for the general populace.</p>

<p>— Yin Yiqiu</p>
<p>Characters: Silly Girl (Maiden), Pitiful Worm (Love Doctor), Dozens of Male Students, Dozens of Female Students</p>
<p>(A school classroom setup, with desks, chairs, a teacher's platform, a blackboard, etc.; but instead of maps on the walls, there are many pictures of courtship poses and Western love paintings.)</p>
<p>(The Principal stands solemnly on the platform at the opening.)</p>
<p>Principal: The courtship methods I taught you last time, you must have all tried them out in practice. Now, everyone report on your results!</p>
<p>Student A: Yesterday, I tried the second step of courtship on Miss Zhang, and she already loves me, but she wants me to buy her a diamond ring, which is terrible! Teacher! Where am I going to get a diamond ring?</p>
<p>Principal: That's easy. You say to her like this: "I hate diamond rings the most. Many men have used them to deceive countless women's love; many women have had their chastity ruined and their souls stained by them, Miss Zhang! I don't want to use such dirty things to exchange for your sacred love! You want my heart, and I can dig it out and give it to you immediately, Miss Zhang! I really respect you and love you so much!"</p>
<p>Student A: What if saying that doesn't work?</p>
<p>Principal: Then you implement our school's third step of courtship, use the "bitter tactic" to deal with her, and you'll definitely succeed!</p>
<p>Principal: Oh no! Oh no! You've all reached the second stage of love sickness! Hurry up and consult the love medicine I compiled!</p>
<p>(The students all bend over their desks and flip through books丨a pink book)</p>
<p>Principal: Okay! Class is almost over! Do you have any questions about the study of love?</p>
<p>Student C: Teacher! What exactly is love?</p>
<p>Principal: Love is like a wintergreen tree, always green and never withering; however, sometimes when the weather is too hot, it will also turn scarlet!</p>
<p>Student D: Teacher! What exactly is a woman?</p>
<p>Principal: A woman is like a bottle of fine wine, it smells very fragrant! It tastes very sweet, but if you take two or three sips, you'll get drunk. Student: Teacher! Then what is a man?</p>
<p>Principal: A man is a candle! The more arrogant and stuck-up a woman is, the more you want to love her; if a woman automatically comes to love you first, you will definitely feel it's bland, tasteless, and even annoying. Alas! Men are really candles! Pitiful Worm: Teacher! Are you a man?</p>
<p>Principal: You idiot! Shut your mouth!</p>
<p>At this moment, the bell rings backstage, and the male and female students all leave the stage hand in hand, leaving only the Principal and the Pitiful Worm.</p>
<p>Principal: Look! Everyone else is playing around in pairs, only you, you idiot! You're always dull and stupid, and you still haven't found a lover. Like this, it's a big problem for our school's reputation. All the students who graduate from our school are victorious generals in the battlefield of love, only you, so hopeless!</p>
<p>Okay! I'm giving you three days! If you still haven't found a lover by the fourth day, you're expelled immediately! Expelled immediately! (The Principal leaves the stage in anger)</p>
<p>Pitiful Worm: Boo hoo hoo! (Bursts into tears while lying on the desk) (Silly Girl enters)</p>
<p>Silly Girl: Ah! Why are you crying?</p>
<p>Pitiful Worm: (Hears a woman's voice, looks up in joy) Ah! Miss...Miss...Miss Miss (Kneels down) I...I...I...I...I from my mother's womb, I...I from one year old until now, I...I from coming to this world...from...from...from...from never seen; seen, such a beautiful...beautiful...beauty!</p>
<p>Silly Girl: Yo! Get up quickly (Helps the Pitiful Worm up) I...I...I also from...from...from never seen...seen such a handsome...handsome...handsome man.</p>
<p>(They fall in love at first sight)</p>
<p>Pitiful Worm: I love you!</p>
<p>Silly Girl: I love you too!</p>

<h3 id="e219">Ducks <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Miao Chongqun</p>
<p>One of Nanjing Cartoons</p>
<p>For a long time, the wild rice stem, water shield soup, and sea bass have been famous. I'm afraid that it's not only the famous scholars in Wu region who want them. If people with a slightly stronger appetite see these words, they may secretly smack their lips a few times and quietly swallow their saliva into their throats. After all, things in books cannot relieve hunger, just as saying that quenching thirst with plums is also a rhetorical statement. However, this era is different from the past. Things with some local flavor can almost arrive from morning till night, thanks to the convenience of transportation. For example, the Jiang leg from some place in Zhejiang has spread all over the country without promotion; also, the so-called "official gift" – ducks – from Nanjing have been brought to all directions as if they had been canonized.</p>
<p>As soon as you see a reed bag with the words "official gift" on it, you know it is Nanjing's duck. The Nanjing I know is almost the same as the era when I knew the official gift duck. So I think, oh Nanjing, the city of ducks!</p>
<p>The first time I went to a friend's house in Nanjing for dinner, there were four dishes on the table, and two of them were ducks, one red and one white, and I clearly saw that each piece of duck had clusters of black hair. I don't know why goosebumps appeared all over my body, and I secretly cried out in my heart - "Don't be polite, eat, it's the famous Nanjing duck." My friend kept putting duck pieces on my plate.</p>
<p>I chewed slowly, but besides tasting the inherent smell of duck, I didn't find any special "Nanjing" taste in the duck.</p>
<p>Bathing in the smell of duck, I couldn't eat more than half a bowl of rice. My bowl was full of duck, and my friend kept urging me:</p>
<p>"Eat duck!"</p>
<p>I thought to myself, is duck supposed to be a meal? But my friend's attitude seemed to tacitly agree. At the same time, he felt that I didn't understand the good intentions of the Nanjing people, and he looked a little unhappy. So he turned around and introduced the duck again:</p>
<p>"This red one is roasted duck; that white one is salted duck (pointing to the white one); it's even better in the autumn, there's also osmanthus duck..."</p>
<p>"Isn't there also official gift duck?" I interrupted him, but also supplemented his words.</p>
<p>"That's right, that's pressed duck."</p>
<p>This was the first time I learned about the names of Nanjing's ducks. Later, in a student's test paper (the topic I gave was probably "My Memories"), she described truthfully, roughly saying:</p>
<p>"... Usually I don't like to study hard, but when it came time to take the middle school entrance exam, I often worried and cried. My mother said it's okay, she would buy me duck to eat after I studied hard... Day after day passed, the food was very delicious, because every meal had my favorite dish - duck... The exam also passed, and the results were announced. Many friends were at my house that day. I passed the exam. My father walked in from outside, slapped the table and said loudly - he was ordering my mother, "Buy her more duck to eat!" At first, I was startled, but later I realized that it was to reward..."</p>
<p>Ducks in memory!</p>
<p>I often cursed the duck. I remember several times when I went out at dusk, I couldn't pass the entrance of the duck shop, countless people holding empty bowls waiting to cut the duck, densely packed the roads in the small alley. Because of the duck, I also cursed Nanjing. But when I thought of these people's love for the duck, their respect for the duck; when I thought of that time when I had dinner at my friend's house, I severely regretted that I had rejected my friend's kindness.</p>
<p>A Nanjing woman is now living with me. Sometimes when we quarreled, her annoying voice made me sigh silently; sometimes when I was angry, her kind of inspiring me... That day, the duck was so delicious! Even if I ate it all, it still wasn't enough... But later, many classmates said when they met, "Buying duck for you to eat!" My face turned red and white... In the blood of every Nanjing person?" But I didn't dare to say that.</p>
<p>It's not my speculation. From many, many aspects of understanding, I gradually knew that Nanjing's duck is not only diverse in name, but the duck does have a kind of "mysterious", "exciting" power in Nanjing. Where is it? "Lurking in the sickening qualities, again made me sigh in silence. But seeking peace is also quite easy. As long as you propose to buy duck to eat, then everything is over. However, I never said anything that would replace my sigh; I can't say, "You duck-like throat and qualities."</p>
<p>Ducks are probably the most, most numerous slaughter in Nanjing; but I don't know on what person or blood the countless "duck spirits" are entrusted.</p>
<h3 id="e220">On Reform <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Sanxin</p>
<p>If "the rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual" is not the ramblings of a madman but must be taken as one's own guide, then one should pay a little attention to the methods of implementing this responsibility!</p>
<p>Perhaps this is not too demanding. When reforming society, one must first "abandon oneself." There are many people who attack others for personal grievances under the guise of reforming society, and there are also many people who rashly extend their own good experiences to others and introduce them to others. There are too many examples of the former "using public office for private gain", so there is no need to cite them; the latter is like "recommending a good doctor" or promoting Chinese medicine because it cured a minor headache, or advocating that everyone in the world should be vegetarian because oneself is vegetarian.</p>
<p>So, treating the times and helping the world is like a good doctor using medicine. Taking the patient as the main body, the method of diagnosis is worth considering. A certain Mr. once advocated opening up air circulation in houses as a way to demolish walls, but the result was just opening windows, but it was still the original purpose; this is a bitter word after understanding the method of reforming society. To reform such a huge and dark force at present, it cannot be done lightly and easily, but must be done with a grand strategy.</p>
<p>If a society is reformed without self, there is no reason why society should not be reformed. Aren't the Great Wall of China and the pyramids both man-made? Even the Heavenly Emperor is afraid of Yu Gong moving mountains. Moreover, when society has reached this point, everyone is thinking about reform, and everywhere can be reformed! It is not too much to use the method of overcorrection, even knowing that it is excessive. Three strikes at the Confucius shop in front, and then present a book of Analects (a magazine) for people to see, perhaps one can slightly tear off the paper crown of morality. This is just a small example, it is one method. Aiming at the weakness of society and throwing a spear is also a method. In addition, there are many feasible methods!</p>
<p>What is worrying is that oneself is "fair", sometimes not seeing the opponent's cruelty; only seeing the graceful smiling face, not seeing the true shape of their fangs and claws, at the moment when the enemy seems to be suing for peace and one is thinking of accepting their surrender, in fact one is surrounded!…</p>
<h3 id="e221">Enlightenment Movement <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>A few days ago, I talked with a friend about the need for an enlightenment movement in China today. Another person said it was unnecessary. Does China really need an enlightenment movement now?</p>
<p>There is no need for high-sounding arguments, let us just look at the facts of China today.</p>
<p>We clearly know that there are literary critics today who do not know what "Don Quixote" is, and even more who do not know that Gorky is both a realist and a romantic writer. And this kind of person is a specialist, or a quasi-specialist, or a self-proclaimed specialist, and I'm afraid there is more than one.</p>
<p>Has Chinese literature entered a new stage? Of course, there are some good buds. But everywhere is still full of ignorance.</p>
<p>China is indeed an "old empire". Is it true that some men of letters and scholars are still living a medieval life in terms of knowledge?</p>
<p>During the "May Fourth" era, I went to Japan to study. A certain compatriot of mine was majoring in economics at the Imperial University. Someone advised him to read "New Youth". He said it was a Christian propaganda product and he would not read it.</p>
<p>Once, my friend Feng Junpei told me an interesting story. He said: A certain provincial supervisor went to the countryside to inspect schools. When he arrived at a certain middle school, he listened to the geography teacher teach geography. When he got to England, the teacher said, "England, 'England', the word 'Jili' is incomprehensible."</p>
<p>I also heard a middle school history teacher talk about Napoleon.</p>

<p>Friend, do you want to escape in the dark night?</p>
<p>The shadows of demons are looming in front, the steps of ghosts are rumbling behind,</p>
<p>Forever and ever, panic will occupy your heart!</p>
<p>Escape, let you escape in the dark night!</p>
<p>Crossing the eerie canyon, listening to the howling of the forest?</p>
<p>The dark night is still in front of you, have you ever escaped the black net?</p>
<p>Gather your courage, poor thing!</p>
<p>You are not the only one walking in the dark night,</p>
<p>If you have courage, aren't the torches in front and behind?</p>
<h3 id="e223">Ming Dynasty Letters <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>"Ming Dynasty Letters," in four volumes, compiled by Qing Dynasty scholars Wang Yuanxun Hanzhang and Cheng Hua in collaboration, based on the original Biyunlou edition. It collects letters from one hundred and sixteen figures, totaling three hundred and forty-six letters. The book includes a preface written by Wang Yi in the Mid-Autumn of the Yiyou year of the Kangxi reign, which begins by stating, "Letter writing is a minor skill, yet it cannot be done without mastery of the ancients." He then says, "Since the late Ming Dynasty, there have been dozens of compilers, but good editions are extremely rare." He criticizes Yang Yongxiu and Wang Pizhen's "Qingcai" anthology, saying, "It is regrettable that they are broad but not precise, incorporating the rhetoric of Zuo Qiuming, the edicts of the two capitals, which is out of place." Finally, he concludes that the two compilers "recognized the desolation of this field and sought to revitalize it, collecting the works of Ming worthies into one compilation, with meticulous selection and a genuine desire to avoid simply pleasing the masses." In reality, although this collection contains many fine pieces and the selection is careful, some parts are still inevitably lengthy and pedantic, inducing drowsiness, and its achievement is not significantly higher than "Qingcai." Typically, each person has one or two pieces included, at most five or six, while Zhang Juzheng has twenty-five specially selected, Gui Youguang fourteen, Tang Xianzu fifteen, Wang Heng fourteen, and Qian Qianyi fourteen, which clearly shows the compilers' preferences. The entire book is divided into four volumes, with short biographies preceding each letter, and the printing quality is excellent, with each person written and printed on a separate page in elegant calligraphy. To my knowledge, there is also a Suzhou edition, but the printing quality is far inferior to the original edition.</p>
<p>This book contains many lyrical works, and among them, the most sincere and poignant expression of the authors' emotions is represented by Zhonglang's letter "To Xiao Yunsheng, Libationer." This letter does not appear to be included in Zhonglang's collected works. The text reads: "The evening moon at Shetang, the spring willows at the West Gate, do you still remember our days together? Counting the years, in the past decade, old friends have dwindled, like morning stars. On Bo Xiu's grave, the poplars are almost thick enough to be pillars. How can one's thoughts not turn to ashes?" And Gui Youguang's letter to Shen Jingfu states: "Poetry is but weeping, it cannot be poetry. Yesterday I saw many friends who wanted to relieve my sorrow. The bond between father and son is gone! These tears are only for my son, and yet you want me to restrain myself?" The author's emotions are more explosive, and the turmoil of his mind can be seen between the lines. Regarding the expression of indignation, I found in this book Yang Shen's letter to Zhang Zhang: "In recent years, all thoughts have turned to ashes, only the habit of writing remains, which has burdened me and brought me trouble. Therefore, I boldly wrote on the wall: 'Old age and sickness make it difficult to approach pen and ink; I vow before the gods not to write poetry or prose.' From now on, I will live like a monk at home, with a bowl of porridge in the morning and a lamp in the evening. What I hold is Pang Gong's four words 'emptying all possessions'!" The author's misanthropic sentiments overflow the page, and his helpless escape is fully expressed. Furthermore, there is Fan Jingwen's letter to Huang Shizhai: "Since you left, the state of affairs has become unspeakable! Today is not yesterday, and I fear that next year will be even worse than this year! This hall is not a place for sparrows to dwell, and I am eager to return home. But the entire court is filled with mutual villagers, and the sovereign is isolated and helpless. I cannot bear to leave the country indifferently. I know that eating without contributing is useless, but I fear that if something happens, even someone to eat without contributing will not be found! This I say with tears!" His heartfelt indignation and contradiction are also fully revealed on the page.</p>
<h3 id="e224">"Please Instruct Me on Two Poems," With a Preface <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Mi</p>
<p>Old Man Zhitang composed a poem for his fiftieth birthday. Famous figures from all over the country wrote poems in response. In particular, a couplet from a certain gentleman, "The edge of the trousers sweeps the ground, suspected of a sick horse," can be described as uniquely brilliant. In addition, "Tea is bitter because it is bitter tea" can also be considered a wise saying. Mi is also fond of poetry, and I respectfully offer two poems in rhyme to Mr. Lin for his amusement.</p>
<p>"Academic Scoundrel" Sir is also from a distinguished family, Stirring up mud and soil on the monk's robe.</p>
<p>The mischievous child once taught the startled crane to cry, The blaring speaker now transforms into a soaring serpent.</p>
<p>Idly watching the Shanghai school flow like water, Hearing that the world is as chaotic as hemp.</p>
<p>Peach and plum blossoms are in full bloom, spring is just right, It doesn't hurt to brew tea slowly under the flowers. (Note 1)</p>
<p>"Humorous" like you, quite the "master," Casually blowing smoke and mist around the monastic robe.</p>
<p>The human world is originally full of mice, And the Master has always hated lazy snakes.</p>
<p>There are many small pieces, like snail tracks on the wall, But the great sound is helpless against the tortoise shell playing hemp. (Note 2)</p>
<p>The high hill has no leftover pieces, Another cup of tea stirs up trouble.</p>
<p>(Note 1) Jinggong has the line "When watching flowers in Jin Valley, don't casually brew tea."</p>
<p>(Note 2) The Tang people have the line "Paper repairs the zither, hemp joins the strings."</p>
<p>. Guess what he said? He said, Napoleon, his strength is like an ox, he can break the wheels of a car, hence the name Napoleon.</p>
<p>Facts of this kind are innumerable. But these are things of the past. What about now? Now, let's look at our middle schools. Of course, some schools are writing eight-legged essays in vernacular, but there are probably quite a few that are still writing classical Chinese essays on "Love of Country," "On Emperor Gaozu of Han," "On the Origin of Man," and so on.</p>
<p>Now, the completion of the railway network in "Manchukuo" and the construction of Rajin Port to complete the shortest route between Japan, Korea, and Manchuria are probably still unknown to most Chinese people. It seems not at all strange that university graduates do not know where Chifeng is.</p>
<p>In all aspects, it is revealed that Chinese people lack common sense. It seems that the field of literature and art cannot be an exception. In China today, there are very few people who have a general idea of world literature. We are still in the age of the omnipotent noun. One glance reveals young people in Western clothes, spouting new nouns and new terms, but it is highly questionable whether they have a deep understanding of any particular thing.</p>
<p>I believe that we should carry out a thorough enlightenment movement for young literary people. From all aspects, from shallow to deep, we should make them truly understand literature and art. Compared with writers and critics in advanced countries, our critics and writers are, to put it bluntly, much more naive. I believe that everyone should carry out a thorough, enlightening educational endeavor for themselves. Are our critics and writers mostly suffering from naivete?</p>
<p>I believe that an enlightenment movement is very necessary now. Don't you think so?</p>
<h3 id="e225">Shanpu Lottery Ticket (4) <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Xiru</p>
<p>In this stillness, suddenly a car, like a fat pig in a hurry, howled a few times and rushed past A-Fa, sweeping a cloud of dust onto him.</p>
<p>"Don't be so smug! In three days, I'll buy one for you to see!" As he thought this, he not only didn't resent the car that had just passed, but he laughed.</p>
<p>Three days later... He really hoped that tomorrow would be three days later!</p>
<p>(Three)</p>
<p>The third day, which seemed like it would never come, finally arrived and passed.</p>
<p>A-Fa didn't win. Although this was a year of miracles, there were still many things that would disappoint you.</p>
<p>But wait, God blesses those who are patient and willing to wait.</p>
<p>Of course, after failing, A-Fa couldn't help but blame himself, mocking himself. His wife and children were starving in the countryside, and he was being absurd here! How difficult it was to circle ten out of one hundred and twenty characters and get seven right! Two jiao was not a small amount, enough for him to eat two or three meals! If he was going to be absurd, he might as well go to the Guangdong Theater to see the "Female Knight-Errant of the Wasteland River," which would be more worthwhile! ...</p>
<p>There were not a few reasons for his self-reproach, and the reasons were not insufficient. But everything was in vain, unable to stop the desire to get rich. This failure strengthened his determination to buy a Shanpu lottery ticket even more. If he didn't buy it, the two mao he lost last time would have to be considered a total loss, and he wouldn't be able to recoup it, which he was unwilling to accept. Moreover, with one hundred and twenty characters, how much could they vary? Surely they would come out one day! He didn't believe it, he insisted on betting on these characters!</p>
<p>He had already bought Shanpu tickets, and it was not difficult to walk into the Xinglong lottery shop. He bought his second ticket.</p>
<p>Again, anxious waiting, fearful waiting; again, many fantasies, beautiful soap bubble-like fantasies.</p>

<h3 id="e226">Commercial News: Financial Discussions on Silver Postponed; Bullion Recovers to 8.2 Yuan <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market, influenced by the news that the meeting between the US President and the silver advocates had been postponed by one day, making the future of the silver issue unclear, stirred up emotions. The market situation weakened and then strengthened, ultimately rising. In the morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and US both rose, and the forward silver price on the Gold and Silver Exchange rose by 5.5 to 7 percent. Exchange rates fell slightly, while spot gold in London remained unchanged. US cotton rose by 27 points, and US wheat rose by 2 5/8. Initial trading was higher, but gold prices were lower due to some closing positions, but stabilized after the opening. The Associated Press reported that the White House silver meeting, originally scheduled for Monday, had been postponed to tomorrow or later because the President needed more time to study the proposals submitted by the silver advocates last Saturday. Reuters also carried a similar report, stating that the President had not appointed any special plans, and those in the silver camp were confident that the procedure would include several mandatory actions and determine passage in this congressional session. The news spread, boosting confidence and increasing buying pressure. Despite struggles due to HSBC's long positions and silver outflows pushing the price past 20 yuan, Chinese merchants repeatedly bought and closed positions, tightening exchange rates and pushing the price past 30 yuan before fluctuating. The night market in Seattle reported forward silver prices up 7/8 and 1 point, with a slight decline. However, due to steady confidence, the gold market remained firm, ultimately struggling around 30 yuan. Spot gold was priced at 1027 yuan. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1013.5 yuan, down 7.5 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 5.5 yuan. Exchange rates opened with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling 3 1/4 pence for British currency and 30.615 yuan for US currency. Cuitai sold positions, retreating to 3 yuan, but news of the silver meeting postponement led to a flurry of buying by Dadecheng, Wupin, Hengyu, Jingfu, Yongde, Daxing, Yongyuqing, and Yongdeng, surging to 26 yuan. Hengxing and Fuxingyong sold positions, retreating to 4 yuan. Hengxing, Fuchang, and Hengyu re-entered the market, rising to 9 yuan. Dalian Gang sold positions, retreating to 7 yuan. Qianchangxiang and Tianfeng made aggressive purchases, again surging to 9 yuan. Tongyi, Dadecheng, Shunmao, Shengda, Dafa, and Yongfuchang took advantage of the high prices to sell, falling to 4.5 yuan. Mitsui and Zhengjin closed August US dollar positions at 8.75, and Yingfeng, Henghui, Xiangyuqing, and Yonglaina rose to 7.5 yuan. Meifeng released August US dollar positions at 8.75, anticipating marked-up prices for British and American currencies. Fuchang and Qianchangxiang sold positions, retreating to 5.2 yuan. Market confidence was quite stable, but sales by Hanheng, Fuchang, Qianchangxiang, Yuanmao, and Yong led to a decline, even though prices were high, twice falling to 3.2 yuan. Maggie Sai also sold August US dollar positions at 9.375. After that, Chinese merchants aggressively bought, tightening the domestic market. Yuanmao, Hengxing, Dalian Gang, Yicheng, Yongde, Senchang, and Yongbingxing jointly purchased, pushing the price past 30 yuan, rising above 31 yuan. Although Hengxing sold within 30 yuan, Fuchang, Richang, Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Shenkang, Yuanchang, and Yongfuan all entered the market, raising the price to 34.5 yuan. Hengyu, Qianchangxiang, and Shengda sold heavily. Mitsui Shanghai closed June US dollar positions at half a yuan. Night market silver prices rose from half a point to one point before falling back below 30 yuan. Yicheng, Shenkang, Yuansheng, Yongzhifeng, and Yonglian jointly bought in, gradually rising again to 33 yuan. Wupin, Yuqing, Yongshengda, Fuchang, and Lai sold. Zhejiang Zhengjin also closed September US dollar positions at 8.75, falling to 29.2 yuan. Tongyi and Hengtai bought at low prices, enabling a recovery. Mitsui had bought September US dollar positions at 8.75, rising above 32 yuan. Under fluctuating conditions, Qianchangxiang and Tianfengyuan competed to sell, falling again to 28.7 yuan. After lingering, the noon closing was 1029.2 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 9.5 yuan. After the market closed, the situation stabilized. The highest price during the first half of the day was 1034.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 1013 yuan, a difference of 21.5 yuan. As a result, the price recovered 8.2 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The clearing price was 32.125 yuan due to HSBC's marked-up US dollar price of 1.25, resulting in a bullion price of 1077 yuan. Based on the closing price, approximately 48 yuan was deducted, 12 yuan less than the previous close. The account registration price for this month was 1031 yuan, and for June it was 1029 yuan. The morning supplemental water was 1031 yuan. The spot gold price was 1027 yuan. The spot market was stable, with Dadecheng selling 350 taels within the market and Yingfengheng selling 650 taels, which were entered by the Tianjin Gang at a premium of 14 yuan. Dadecheng also sold to the Tianjin Gang at a premium of 13.8 yuan. There were slight transactions in eastern goods, priced at a premium of 12.25 to 12.5 yuan. The Central Bank opened a position to Yingfengheng for 105 spot bars at the noon closing price of 1031 yuan. Yesterday's public bills released included 140 bars from Yingfengheng and 35 bars from Dadecheng. Those who received the bills included 84 bars each from Qianchangxiang and Yuanyi, and 7 bars from Changshengyong. Today, there were also 14 bars received and released. There are still 1036 May notes remaining. In total, there are three long positions and six short positions.</p>
<p>Trading within the market was flat. Overall, Shunli, Wanxing, Yifeng, Yongfuxing, Yongchangsheng, Yongyuqingyong, Tongchun, Zhifengyong, Fuyu, Dachang, Xiangfutai, Hengrui, Kangyuanchun, Yongdeshenchang, and Yichengshenkang were on the buying side. Shengda, Yuanheng, Chengkang, Yongchangtai, Bingxing, Yuanmao, Yingfengheng, Hengyu, Dafa Yong, and Cuitaiyuanyi, Qianchangxiang were on the selling side. Bingxingqingfa, Yongxianghe, Qianchangxiang, Daxing, Yonghuixiang, and Tianfeng advanced and then exited. Fuchang Hengxing exited and then re-entered. Dalian Gang and Shunli jointly traded over 1,600 bars, closing over 300 bars. Wanxing jointly traded over 1,400 bars, closing over 100 bars. The Guangdong Gang Hengxing traded over 200 bars each way, with little difference in closing. Shengda sold over 400 bars. As of today, the total number of June futures chips is 28,875 bars, with a total of 47 long positions and 51 short positions. The total number of transactions for the day was 48,230 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e227">The Exchange Market Tightens Yesterday Under the Pressure of Chinese Merchants; Bank Rates Rise 1.25 for Both British and American Currencies <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign dispatches yesterday, London big bars rose 3 1/8, far bars rose 1/4, American silver rose 6 1/4, and forward silver prices rose 7.2%. British to American rates fell 3 3/4, American to British rates fell 1 1/4, British to French rates rose 3 points, American to French rates shrunk 2.5, London spot gold remained unchanged, private telegrams showed silver prices rising 8 1/8, and exchange rates shrinking 1/4. The exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling 3 1/4 pence for British currency and 32.625 yuan for American currency, with British and American currencies rising 0.0625 each compared to the previous close. After the opening, Chinese merchants immediately pushed the price up, as news of the silver camp's failure to meet with the President on Monday caused sudden tension. HSBC's marked-up rate revealed that British and American currencies both rose 1.25, at which point the banks sold less and the market stabilized. However, as Chinese merchants pushed the price up again, both British and American exchange rates tightened. When news of the half-point rise in silver prices in the Seattle night market arrived, the banks sold again, and the process repeated itself, fluctuating. The noon closing selling prices were 1 shilling 3 1/8 pence for British currency and 32.375 yuan for American currency, with British currency tightening 1.25 and American currency tightening 3 1/8 compared to the previous close. The French franc was sold to Zhongfu by the Sino-French bank at 493 for May and 495 for June. Chinese merchants pushed the price up by approximately 100,000 pounds and 400,000 US dollars.

<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Spring Races, and foreign merchants were still only open for half a day, so trading remained subdued. Although Chinese merchants remained open as usual, they were still affected by foreign merchants and were less active than usual. However, the interbank call loan market was not significantly affected by foreign merchants, and it continued to rise in the past two days, with both the morning and afternoon markets at 8 points, an increase of 2 points from the previous day. Initial trading of forward contracts added 2 points, and then opened at 3 points as the market situation slightly improved. Trading of promissory notes was largely unchanged. The morning market saw over 4.1 million in transfers and new trades, while the afternoon market saw over 200,000 in trades. Trading in the small association totaled over 400,000. Bank settlements were limited due to the Spring Races closure of foreign banks, totaling over 1.2 million in note settlements, over 1.7 million in settlements of various goods, exchange deposits, and other items, and 200,000 in warehouse receipts. Although Chinese banks abolished the practice of closing for the Spring Races this year, they were still affected by foreign merchants and did not see a boom. Note settlements totaled over 2.3 million, settlements of various goods, exchange deposits, and collateral items totaled over 3.1 million, customs duties totaled over 300,000, and warehouse receipts totaled 300,000.

<p>丨Only Fluctuations of About 1 Jiao丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading on the Chinese Securities Exchange became even quieter, and the market was particularly sluggish. Major players rarely entered or exited the market, and various groups mostly took a wait-and-see approach. The market was only subject to a small number of sporadic transactions, causing it to drift to extreme fluctuation. The situation was dull, and neither the bulls nor the bears had an opportunity to take advantage of the situation. Speculators also contracted. The future may be to fluctuate for a while, waiting for changes. Yesterday, from morning to night, the market was completely in a state of fluctuation and stagnation. The rise and fall of each盘 were inconsistent, with some rising and others falling, mostly by 5 分 or 1 角. Judging from the highs and lows, it seems that large-scale selling has stopped, and the bulls are unwilling to let go, and few new进胃 are seen. With no changes in the environment, the bond market should be quiet for a while. Table transactions were slightly off, mostly bullish. The market price was slightly lower near-term and higher far-term. Overall, market prices were mixed, with most fluctuations being around 1 角. Only the 1928 bond, this month's small bond, was the highest at 2 角半. The total transaction volume was 6,181,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot and 6,180,000 yuan in futures. Today, the market is closed for the National Humiliation Memorial Day. The different results of the mixed rises and falls are compared and listed in the table below (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the stock market's decline intensified yesterday, setting a low record for the year. Trading was brisk, unseen since February. First, speculators were convinced that the Senate would pass the Exchange Management Act and closed their positions. Second, Roosevelt Cheng, a silver advocate, needed considerable time to study silver legislation before its enactment. Silver stocks plummeted as a result. Third, according to Dieterro news, a group that usually supports auto stocks is now temporarily on the sidelines. Due to these three factors, the market became unsustainable. However, forward silver was strong all day, and other goods were also high due to the severe drought in the Midwest wheat region. The small exchange followed the stock exchange down. Bond prices fluctuated. US government bonds were buoyant and strong. The agent also reported that (securities were being dumped quite heavily). There was a slight recovery before the close, and there may be a rebound after a small continuation tomorrow. (Wheat) The drought in the producing areas continues with no signs of rain. Pests are breeding rapidly, and high prices seem inevitable. (Cotton) Industry peers and overseas investors bought in at low prices, causing short covering. The market became more vigorous after that. According to news, the president's attitude toward silver legislation is potentially better than before. (Rubber) The market is calm, and high consumption continues unabated. Government approval of the agreement should benefit the bullish side. (Silver) Silver prices rose due to continued high levels of spot buying. Speculators are now waiting for the outcome of the President's meeting with silver advocates tomorrow. The total volume of trading was 2.3 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>After the yarn market initially rose and then weakened, the situation remains tight. With sales to North China coming one after another, all the sixteen-count yarn from various factories has been sold out. As a result, confidence is increasing, and the buying trend is intensifying. However, in the afternoon market, there was talk of a certain factory selling off at a high price, and the closing price suddenly turned downward. However, with genuine demand being strong, market prices should be able to stabilize.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Marked Yarn Buying Enthusiasm is Very High <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>The marked yarn market opened strong this morning, with US cotton prices rising, leading to tense sentiment and a sudden surge in buying interest. Prices for each month rose by one yuan, and one, two, three, five, six, and seven jiao respectively. The afternoon opening was flat. After about twenty or thirty deals, it was heard that the Tianjin group was trading actively, causing another rise. However, some manufacturers sold off at the close, causing prices for each month to fall back by two, three, and five jiao. The total volume traded for the day was 48,700 bales. The sales were: Tongfu 1,300 bales, Yuanda 1,750 bales, Huikang 2,100 bales, Changfeng 2,400 bales, Yongchang 1,000 bales, and Yuanda 1,300 bales. Purchases included: Mingde 1,150 bales, Chunji 1,200 bales, Dafeng 900 bales, Gengfeng 750 bales, Renfeng 2,450 bales, Taichang 1,800 bales, and Yongda 800 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>

<p>The spot yarn sales market remains robust. It is estimated that various groups bought a total of 1,000 bales throughout the day. Prices rose by one yuan. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 205 Jiangxi 25 Co-trade 40</p>
<p>Shantou 40 Ningbo 5 Xiamen 5</p>
<p>Guangdong 320 Henan 50</p>
<p>Tianjin 1,300 Sichuan 25</p>
<p>The cotton market is very tight, and the rising trend is intense. Due to the organization of bullish companies for the May contract, the market is becoming more expensive. Short sellers are particularly anxious to cover their positions, which intensifies the rising trend. Although there is genuine demand for trading, higher prices are causing factory consumption to lag. The future direction still depends on imported cotton.</p>

<p>The marked flower market opened strong this morning, with US cotton prices trending upward, further improving market sentiment. There were few sellers in the market, and prices for each month rose again by one, two, and three jiao. In the afternoon, near-term contracts rose by one jiao, while distant-month contracts fell by five fen. The total volume traded for the day was 166,100 dan. The sales were: Huikang 7,100 dan, Dafu 2,500 dan, Tongfu 2,000 dan, Dafeng 4,100 dan, Yuanda 3,800 dan, Hengde 2,500 dan, Shenji 4,000 dan, Tonghe 3,600 dan, Changhe 4,500 dan, Yuanxingchang 2,800 dan.

<p>Yesterday's US cotton market was active due to positive Liverpool news and firm Liverpool buying. As a result, spot prices rose by 15 points per pound, and futures prices rose by 24 to 27 points per pound. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 3 points, and futures prices rose by 12 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 3 points. The Mumbai cotton market rose due to speculation buying on the possible New York silver legislation. As a result, Pingar fell by half a rupee, Olmura fell by two and a half annas, and White Rosie fell by one rupee. The original telegram is on the left (dated 7th):</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market opened in the morning, and the market for each month showed an initial firmness followed by softness. Foreign wheat quotations in Chicago saw sharp gains, rising by about one jiao for near-term contracts and seven jiao to one yuan for distant contracts. There was no market in Canada, so the sentiment was slightly upbeat at the opening, about one fen better than the previous day's close. However, as bulls successively unwound their positions and buyers mostly remained on the sidelines, the market weakened again. When the market opened in the afternoon, the sentiment for each month was initially flat. Subsequently, fewer factories released inventory compared to the previous day, and a slight rain improved sentiment among some participants. Short sellers also covered their positions, resulting in a pattern of large declines followed by small recoveries. As a result, the current month was better by two and a half li, June/July contracts were better by one fen, August was better by one fen and two and a half li, September was better by one fen and seven and a half li, and October was better by one fen and two and a half li.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Flat and Weak State of Wheat Futures <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, both in the morning and afternoon openings, generally showed a flat and weak trend. Foreign wheat quotations in Chicago were better by three to seven jiao to one yuan. However, the market situation remained unfavorable. Because the spot wheat market was so bleak, the demand from mills after the new wheat enters the market is unlikely to be as active as in previous years. With everyone being pessimistic, buying interest naturally became even more subdued. Therefore, although foreign wheat prices were better, the market sentiment did not improve. As a result, June contracts fell by two fen, and July/August contracts fell by one fen. The spot wheat inventory is very large, and factories rarely inquire. Only large factories may have some small transactions. 12,000 bags of spot wheat continued to open, purchased by Fuxin etc., at prices of three yuan, two yuan and eighty-nine jiao, down to two yuan and seventy jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Improved Prospects for Hexia Rice <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source from various groups is thirty to forty boats (over 6,000 shi), mostly late rice, with thick japonica and various colors accounting for only half. The weather turned overcast, and sentiment was firmer. Buyer interest continues from groups such as Nanyang and Beiyang, with Nanyang being particularly keen and Beiyang slightly less so. As a result, about 25-600 bags of Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, and other goods were sold. Although the market showed signs of improvement, it was still slightly weaker, and prices only managed to increase by about five fen. Due to consistently weak supply of thick japonica from various groups, the market tone is tight, and the store sentiment is strong. Prices for Changbang, Sutong, Nangang, and other types continued to be better by a jiao. The edge and Du tip also showed signs of tightness. Imported rice was relatively dull. The overcast sky made the rice very popular. The market situation was still able to be outstanding.</p>
<p>(26-27 boats arrived from Hexia and other places in North Shanghai. The sales appetite for various colors in the market is very active. The market tone for white japonica and white yuan are strong, with prices rising by one to two jiao. Early thin rice with sheep Du and Bu tip price increases by one jiao or so.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Both Foreign and Local Indica Rice Have Active Demand <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's indica rice market saw continued active demand for local rice. However, with arrivals gradually coming from Hunan, Shashi, Nanjing, and other ports, sentiment stabilized slightly, and owners were not able to push prices up significantly. Except for Jiangxi rice, which has insufficient self-supply in the production area and interrupted supply, the market is still looking good. Other types of rice will have cargo arriving daily, and the market is expected to return to level. Yesterday, the local street was most active, selling over 1,600 bags of managed indica rice and 2,000 bags of Xiaojiao. The Minbang appetite remains good, buying over 2,000 bags of various indica rice. The Wenzhou gang also accommodated 200 bags of brown rice. Prices, except for those arriving slightly later being about three to five fen cheaper, were similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Zhengyangguan Beans Exit at Three Yuan Barrier <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market remained tight due to robust sales of bean cakes. "The total market transaction for various cakes was over 38,000 pieces, purchased by exports to the mainland." Factory appetite continued as a result, and high-quality goods have been pushed up to exceed the three-yuan barrier. The future situation will still depend on factory demand. Yesterday, it was estimated that two cars of Zhengyangguan beans were purchased from this street at prices of three yuan and one fen and two yuan and ninety-eight jiao. One car of Caifeihe beans was purchased at a price of two yuan and ninety-six jiao. Factories purchased five cars of Yingzhou beans at prices ranging from two yuan and ninety jiao to eighty-eight jiao. Three cars of Bengbu beans were purchased at prices ranging from two yuan and eight jiao to seven jiao six. One car of Haozhou beans was purchased at a price of two yuan and eight jiao six. The Xiamen gang also purchased over 200 bags of Hankou Xinyangzhou beans at a price of two yuan and eight jiao, but the deal was not finalized.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Sugar Market, Domestic Chaoqing Ground Price Rises by Half a Yuan <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market weakened as the Customs Gold Unit remained weak. However, with the current ground price of domestic Chaoqing sugar, prices are bound to rise in the future. The association quoted 24 yuan for coarse sand white sugar, down another jiao, and 16 yuan and one jiao for high-quality 8-9 grade Dutch red sugar, also showing a decline and lacking transactions. Taikoo sugar B mark was quoted at 21 yuan and one jiao, HX mark at 20 yuan and a half jiao. There were some transactions. Zhenji's own factory No. 1 white sugar was 19 and a half yuan, with some sales, and the rest was returned. The market trend for Chaoqing is tight and has been for many days. Yesterday, the buying appetite was very strong, but dealers were unwilling to open much, only reluctantly selling about 800 bags, including 11 and a half yuan for Huanggang Qing, 10 yuan and eight jiao for Bannan Qing, and 10 yuan and six jiao for Longgang Qing. Later, a telegram from Shantou said that the inventory of Qing sugar was scarce and that it would need to rise by four to five jiao to be available. As a result, the market situation became even firmer, and dealers held firm and refused to sell. The total inventory in this market is less than 20,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e245">North and South Goods, Red Rice Inventory Shortage Leads to Price Increase <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Recently, red rice prices have risen frequently due to inventory shortages in the local area. According to Shantou news, prices are even higher than in Shanghai, making it extremely difficult to make a deal. Although there are no large-scale sales from various gangs here, the scattered sales are very active. Furthermore, the total market inventory is only about two to three hundred bags, further solidifying the market situation. Current quotes, such as higher-quality goods, require thirty-two to three yuan, secondary quality twenty-seven to eight yuan, and ordinary quality twenty yuan and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Silk and Tea, Spring Silkworm Season in Full Swing <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>(Hang County) This year's sericulture in the four townships of Hang County is purely affected by unfavorable weather. Although the instructors have tried their best to adjust the temperature and humidity and carefully raise the improved varieties bred in Linping, Gaosi, Sanbao, Hushu, Xiecun, and other places, the silkworms repeatedly experienced eye loss and leaf retention after the second sleep. The local silkworm varieties raised in the remaining areas of the upper four townships have shown signs of white stiffness and diarrhea in the second and third stages, resulting in significant losses. Fortunately, the weather has now turned sunny and warm, with early batches already reaching the large-eye leaf-opening stage, and late batches also reaching the three-eye leaf-foot stage, and development is improving.</p>
<p>(Fuyang) This year, farmers, aware of the unfavorable silkworm breeding in recent years, have weak ant breeding this year, and many are breeding local varieties. The weather is cold, and ant collection is late. The development of improved varieties is also slow. After leaf opening, the humidity is high and the temperature is low, and local silkworms repeatedly experience problems, with yellowing, black vomiting, and losses of 40-50%. Currently, the early batches in Dayuan Town, Tangjiabu, and other places have reached the three-eye leaf-foot stage. The late batches of improved silkworms in Shuxi and other areas are only at the three-eye robust leaf stage. In the past two days, the weather has been sunny and warm, and silkworms have developed smoothly and eaten leaves vigorously.</p>
<p>(Chongde) This year's silkworm season in various townships has been severely damaged due to continuous rain and cold weather. Improved silkworms have not developed well. Improved varieties are mostly bred in Tujia Dam and Fujia Bridge, so the silkworm season is later. Rural economies in Shimenwan, Wuhejing, Taizitang Bridge, and other places are declining, and local silkworm varieties are bred, resulting in heavier losses. Fortunately, the weather has now turned sunny and warm, and the temperature has risen sharply. The silkworms' development is improving, with early batches having opened leaves for three or four days after the second sleep, and late batches also having sufficient leaves. The current situation is quite good.</p>

<p>After Wenzhou's new black tea was shipped to Shanghai last week, negotiations between Chinese and foreign parties lasted for several days without a deal. Yesterday, the market reached an agreement between Gong Sheng Yong Tea Firm and Jardine Matheson to trade over 120 boxes at a new price of 50 yuan, equivalent to 41-42 yuan by the local scale. It seems that Chinese merchants have no profit to gain. Yesterday, the market for local Zhuang Zhenmei green tea did not release new prices, and the situation remains unfavorable.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Zhuji Mao Tea Arrives in Shanghai in Large Quantities <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, local Zhuang tea factories transported another 60-odd packages of Zhuji Mao tea from Hangzhou. Factories such as Dadechang, Tongyifeng, and Changji have already begun manufacturing. It is said that new goods from Suian will also arrive in Shanghai within a few days.</p>
<h3 id="e249">New News on Anhui and Jiangxi Black Tea <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>In the past three or four days, Qimen's first-grade black tea has officially opened gardens for picking and production. With continuous sunny weather and morning dew, the leaves picked by mountain households are conducive to drying, and the quality of buds and tips is excellent. Various Menzi Zhuang in the southwest township are rushing to purchase, and the tea is pouring in vigorously. The market price opened at over 40 yuan in the south road and over 60 yuan in the west road, which is 10-20 yuan lower than the mountain prices in previous years. The first grade is full for those who have more advantageous locations and broader tea sources, and they are starting to screen and produce. Today (the 3rd) it is raining heavily and turning cold. If it does not clear up in the next few days, the second-grade tea will be greatly affected. In total, there are more than 150 tea-making companies open for business in the county, with the city accounting for seven and the southwest roads accounting for the majority. The liveliness of the market is no less than in previous years.</p>
<p>This year, foreign merchants are paying attention to the Zhongzhuang of Zhide black tea, and the market is active. Tea warehouses such as Yuanfengrun in Shanghai have set up Zhuang to operate tea and also engage in lending in Yaodu Street. The first-grade black tea has begun to be picked one after another. The Zhuang are competing to purchase tea, and the mountain price ranges from 40 yuan to 50 odd yuan, similar to the Qicha in high Zhuang. In order to rush new listings, each company is rushing to produce, hoping to form a pile and start shipping as soon as possible. Hekou black tea has been sold to foreign firms as a bulk commodity. Due to small overseas market sales, it has suffered losses for years, and the market is declining day by day. Recently, the local Red Bandits are difficult to eliminate immediately, so tea merchants are still unwilling to try this year's tea business. The warehouses are also focusing on Qimen and Yixing, and the tea is from Lianghu and Xiushui. Hekou red tea is ignored, and the Hekou tea market is unlikely to recover this year.</p>

<h3 id="e250">The Arms Race Among the Great Powers and the Second World War <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>By Jia Wei</p>
<p>Recent newspapers are truly frightening. The date of the "General Disarmament Commission" on May 30th is approaching day by day, but unexpectedly, every day carries headlines such as "General Disarmament Almost Hopeless, European Countries Anxious and Insecure," "World War Clouds Loom, Arms Factories in Various Countries Busy Manufacturing Weapons," "British Insurers Refuse to Underwrite War Risk Insurance," "War Rumors in Europe Intensify," "France Decides to Expand Navy," "Greed of Eastern Neighbors Unquenchable, Soviet Chairman Inspects National Defense," "Situation in the Far East Shifts, US Navy Expansion Imminent"... Using large fonts and bold statements is truly shocking. At the same time, let's look at some recent, and perhaps already past (because this is "increasing day by day") "small statistics": the world's annual military expenditure reaches 500 million gold yuan; Germany's military budget this year increased by more than 40% compared to last year; Japan's naval construction has already reached 95% of the treaty limit; France's military expenditure accounts for 20% of its budget, with each French person bearing an average military expenditure of 13.6 US dollars, the highest in the world... In this way, the so-called effectiveness and future results of this long-running "Disarmament Conference" can all be recognized and predicted.</p>
<p>Originally, in the current stage of the situation, trying to achieve any "disarmament" or "arms reduction" is truly wishful thinking and self-deception. Under such a "conference," the imperialist powers are all based on the principle of expanding their own armaments while cutting those of other countries. Furthermore, the fact that some "alliances" and "conventions" in the recent past and still continuing were disregarded and almost completely destroyed by Japanese imperialism serves as the best comparison and clear evidence. Therefore, "Another world war is coming!" This is what many people are worried about. But is the Second World War inevitable? Where do its possibilities and causes lie? To understand these things, one can only start from the objective conditions of the historical process.</p>
<p>As we already know, because many backward countries have been swept into the vortex of world capitalism, this has created the possibility of capital exports by capitalist countries. At the same time, because capitalist countries have long reached "excessive maturity," and their capital (which of course first lies in the underdevelopment of their agriculture and the poverty of the masses) has long been insufficient for its "profitable" investment markets, this has created the necessity of capital exports, which is why the capitalist powers are "making persistent efforts," "greedily unquenchable," "competing with each other" to seize their "profitable" investment markets, sales markets, and sources of raw materials. This is also the development and seizure of colonies. Of course, the commercial war of capitalist countries to seize high profit rates must be prepared for military war. But since one must prepare for military war, one must work harder to enrich the sources of wealth through commercial war. Therefore, the military armaments of capitalist countries are becoming increasingly competitive. And their commercial wars are becoming more and more fierce, and in the end, they can only be temporarily resolved with a shocking military war. However, the internal and mutual contradictions of capitalist countries can only become more and more acute under this situation and can never be resolved. The fact that the situation between capitalist countries such as Germany, France, Britain, and Russia during the First World War in 1914 and their current situation remains irreconcilable is excellent evidence.

<p>— He Juefu</p>
<p>I boarded the bus to Lingyin Temple on a drizzly morning. Although it was morning, the goose-feather-like fine rain was falling incessantly; however, devout men and women pilgrims were still walking on the muddy path in a continuous stream like clouds.</p>
<p>Getting off the bus and stepping into the main gate of Lingyin Temple, I looked up at the yellow paper slogans plastered all over the walls on both sides, the armed comrades standing tall beside the road and at every doorway with long guns and bayonets, and the archways across the road with large white characters "Welcome XX..." hanging on them. You would always suspect that you had gone the wrong way and mistakenly entered a celebration or welcome rally for some dignitary. However, as soon as you walked into the first main hall, the scene changed completely. Here, although several soldiers with long guns and bayonets also stood on both sides of the front door, all that could be seen inside were the god-like clay statues, curling incense smoke, flickering candlelight, and devout men and women pilgrims kneeling and worshiping. It seemed that the prosperity of the incense was unprecedented since the opening of the temple!</p>
<p>Passing through the main hall, what towered in front was a magnificent grand hall. There, it was where our masters and lamas set up altars and chanted scriptures. On both sides of the corridor leading to the main hall, several guards were guarding, and tourists were not allowed to go up at will. When I stepped straight in, I was stopped by a guard who asked:</p>
<p>"Do you have an admission ticket?"</p>
<p>"No!" I replied respectfully.</p>
<p>"You can't go in without an admission ticket; however, if you are anxious to take a look, you can go to the general affairs office to ask for one," he said, pointing to a small room in the corridor.</p>
<p>I followed the direction he pointed and went to the general affairs office, where I saw the large characters "Admission ticket not for sale" posted on the wall, and I thought to myself. Maybe you can get it by saying a few oath-like words, right? However, when I told the clerk about my intention, he took out several notebooks from the drawer and placed them in front of me; and said with a smile very gently.</p>
<p>"Yes, not for sale; however, there is a small restriction. That is, whoever wants to save the souls of the dead or seek blessings for themselves can donate one or ten yuan at will to cover the expenses of this association, and they can get a free ticket. If anyone can come and take it at will, then there is no need to spend a lot of money to print these things. Sir, what do you think? Just write your name here, are you seeking blessings for yourself?"</p>
<p>After listening to his words, I didn't say anything, because I couldn't afford to spend so much money; but. Looking at the crowded tourists and pilgrims above, I was indeed a little moved. I seemed to have lost my judgment, just wandering and pondering in the corridor!</p>
<p>It was thanks to God's blessing that a young man working here saw my hesitant appearance, walked up to my side, and said softly in my ear:</p>
<p>"Give me two dimes, and I'll lend you one; however, this is my personal one, you have to return it to me after you've finished watching it above!"</p>
<p>"Thank you!" For two dimes, I could see many new things, and of course I was very happy to do so. I immediately took out two dimes and gave it to him, and quickly walked up the steps to the main hall.</p>
<p>The entrance of the hall was tightly packed with a large crowd of onlookers, and it took me a lot of effort to squeeze in. Inside, piled in the center was the golden body of our Buddha Tathagata, below the golden body was the seat of our master, and on both sides of the master were seated more than a dozen lamas. In front of them were placed many Tibetan Buddhist scriptures and instruments such as horns and reeds. Under the command of the master, everyone took the same rhythm and the same tune, chanting "La Ya Sha..." After chanting, they played a piece of Tibetan (?) music. It looked very devout. I squeezed tightly in the crowd and watched intently for more than an hour, always chanting scriptures and playing music in succession; I didn't see any new tricks, and I really felt bored. I secretly paid a salute to the master, squeezed out of the crowd, and embarked on the way home.</p>
<p>On the way back, I was always thinking silently like this. After our suffering sentient beings have been so painstakingly prayed for by the master, who would dare not believe that they can be saved?</p>

<h3 id="e253">Talking About Contradiction <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenqiu</p>
<p>A spear and a shield, viewed separately, do not harmonize. If everything in the world could proceed smoothly, without any obstacles in the middle to cause trouble, contradictions would not arise. For example, if we were living in a prosperous feudal era, we would follow the systems and habits of the old society without any scruples, and we would not find it strange for anyone to burn incense and worship Buddha, or for scholars to raise concubines. But after the feudal society, a capitalist society came along, which is what is called an obstacle in the middle causing trouble. We would then find it contradictory to see a ten-story building on Nanjing Road standing next to an antique "Rainbow Temple" from the Middle Ages under the massive influence of capital; it would also be a contradictory phenomenon to see a few women with bound feet and long hair in the midst of a trend where women's clothing competes to expose the chest and legs. If someone at this time were to read Zhao Ziyue's and Mencius's sayings and try to take the imperial examination and become a top scholar, they would be scolded as being old-fashioned, outdated, and unfit to be human! Therefore, the so-called contradiction comes entirely from disharmony, and disharmony is entirely the result of changes in the times.</p>
<p>However, in the Chinese saying that "heroes create the times," the basis of contradiction in "temporal error" is not established. Heroes can create the times, and changes in the times can lead to contradictions, so isn't contradiction indirectly created by human power? Therefore, contradiction becomes something in people's heads, and eventually, people gradually forget its true source.</p>
<p>Originally, Confucius's Doctrine of the Mean in China called on people to achieve a "middle ground," and it was not necessary to reveal contradictions very obviously. It was best to handle everything ambiguously and cleverly, which was especially in line with art. A great man would not easily show his unhappiness on the outside, and would still maintain a calm attitude on the surface; Ah Q could console himself by comparing himself to the "father" of the person who beat him. Therefore, contradictions in China have long been incorporated into the cultivation of the Doctrine of the Mean by the Chinese people.</p>
<p>For example, if Fascism enters China, and someone praises it as a political ideology that is "the trend of the world," can you criticize them for praising it unreasonably? Therefore, this statement also has great artistic attainments.</p>
<p>There is simply no contradiction to speak of in China. Contradiction is dissolved by the broad and profound cultivation of the Chinese nation. Because the Chinese people's thought of the Mean is consistent, contradiction in China恰恰 becomes "unity." This is precisely what is created by "heroes creating the times."</p>

<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>From the time when humans hung up their genitals and wrestled with wild beasts with their bare hands, humans slowly learned to make fire by drilling wood and build houses with wood. Up to now, they wear gorgeous clothes, live in tall houses, and continue to invent airplanes, cannons, and克車. Those wild beasts that wrestled with humans at the same time, the most remarkable of which is to make money for Haijingbo. Humans are the spirit of all things, and it is not an empty phrase. Humans living in cities are even more arrogant, taking cars, eating big dishes, that is, the houses that are said to shelter from the wind and rain in elementary school textbooks have become extremely exquisite, even the pigeon cage style ones, also the kitchen, mezzanine, and sun terrace are all head is head, the road is the road. The lowest-level villagers in the human race come to Shanghai, I am afraid that they will enter the gate and not know where the back door is, so swallows and hares want to build a lute, even if you play it, you don't want to play it.</p>
<p>The exquisiteness of the house is not counted, all the furniture used is also becoming more and more modern day by day, couples must sleep on two beds in Taoli, wardrobes, sofas, and tables have become a style that can not be called out,摩之登之, beautifully named three-dimensional, it is indeed a foreign legend.</p>
<p>According to my grandfather's grandfather's inheritance, the living room is mainly comfortable, and the furniture is mainly practical, so when smoking a water pipe, you must sit in a Taishi chair, in summer, the wind is cool, there is a wide and long spring bench, a foot stove requires a pit bed, everything seems to have evolved to the point where it can not be added, who料 the spirit of all things, the human race, is 精求益精 for comfort,孜孜兀兀, non-stop, or the son can enjoy this kind of福 of flying an airplane and smoking opium. If I was born five hundred years later, I could use electricity to write manuscripts.</p>
<p>One pull is so far away, let's talk less gossip, let's get to the point, it is said that my friend won the aviation lottery, abandoned the pigeon cage style pavilion and lived in a pointed roof, square door, triangular window of the堂堂 mansion, naturally the internal decoration, to seek modern, in order to seek the living room to be comfortable. All kinds of furniture, are匠心獨造, the bed is low and reaches the ground, only couples also have two in Taoli, the wardrobe becomes a polygon, round its table, large for stuffing a duck, the sofa is like a manure basket, if it is convenient for couples to 克司 in Taoli, the dressing table is like a straw shed after the war, tilted and unique, and if the wood is not complete, barely put it together. Someone said, about friends three or four造其居, everyone嘆摩登 furniture, I also忝為人類之一,竟像老虎之遇電鞭,發不出威來了.</p>
<p>But when eating, a difficult problem occurs, call for side dishes, modern round table is not enough to apply, or the red wood broken square table in the nanny's room is enough to eat a big meal. After dinner, there is nothing to消遺, propose to play mahjong, and the difficult problem is this modern round table, four people共八只 hand and mahjong one hundred and thirty-six only, small war, how to write the哀的美頓? Modern誠害人不淺哉. Therefore,抽其香烟,取於糞箕形之沙發,此摩登比較合用,如夫妻淘裏擁抱克司,樂在斯中矣. However, singles who smoke cigarettes must大動乾坤 for throwing cigarette butts and dusting ashes. The whole body is leaning forward and backward. The Taishi chair does not have such噜囌. Why did the spirit of all things, the human race, suddenly create these useless modern goods, and those few sea dogs are still performing stunts in the Great World, it is great to spend two dimes to learn a little愚者一智. Finally, it is said that since entering the modern residence, their couples always sleep in the same bed, and the other one can not be used as a decoration, although set but not sleepy,暴殄天物也.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Women's Common Diseases <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Cen</p>
<p>Everyone says that women have several common diseases. Such as vanity, stinginess, jealousy, dependence, passivity</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>and so on. I also think it's good, it seems difficult to deny. If you don't believe it, we can see: how many women in society fall into deep pain for the sake of vanity; for the sake of stinginess and jealousy, various meaningless conflicts and misunderstandings occur and lead to tragedy; not even applying a little powder to please men, eventually becoming other people's toys; good dependence and passive behavior lead to the formation of a weak woman with no will. Especially a very revolutionary woman with profound knowledge, if she falls in love with a counter-revolutionary man, as a result, she also goes to do counter-revolutionary work, perhaps abandoning the important responsibility of revolution and willing to retreat to the corrupt old society to live a life of dependence, jealousy, quarrel, pleasing, and hypocrisy. I think this further exposes the weakness of women's inability to move upward. We are not saying that every woman must suffer from this weakness and disease, at least 90 percent of them are like this.</p>
<p>In fact, this common disease is not only understood by men, women themselves also know it very well, but they are not willing to treat it! They always seem to be willing to have no days of standing out, not reviewing their own shortcomings, and even losing their temper when criticized. Such a lack of self-respect, it seems no wonder that for thousands of years, they have been oppressed! History clearly tells us that women have always been bullied in society. It is true that we attribute this to the poor social system of the past. Therefore, after the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, until the time of the May Fourth Movement, the clamor for women's liberation was shouted for a long time; this was obviously a great opportunity for women to save themselves. But this clamor is still only a clamor after all, it cannot become very practical, so that women can obtain true liberation and obtain a truly equal social status from that time on. Regarding this, we cannot but say that on the one hand, it is the fault of this society, they implement deceptive education, they are not willing to guide them to realize their due rights in society: and on the other hand, we cannot but say that women themselves do not know how to cherish themselves, self-respect to remove their own diseases, climbing the road forward and working hard to move upward, they let others call out injustices for her, but they do not care, let this clamor slowly sink in the air. Keeping women's status in the same attitude as in the past, or it can be said that it has lost its value more than before! In the past, women were still able to manage the family finances, which was considered to have fulfilled their share of human responsibility, and now the so-called new women, who have read many years of Chinese and foreign texts, do not know what they can contribute to society? Although society cannot give them opportunities, at least they must first respect and examine themselves, remove the unconscious demon diseases, enrich their own academic foundation, and prepare for struggle.</p>

<p>Axiang is the daughter of a poor family, fifteen years old; is the most beautiful season of every girl. She has developed very completely, people say: "A little girl like Axiang should have a satisfactory husband. She is beautiful and very capable, watching her take care of her two younger brothers, is so careful, the neighbors never hear the children crying.</p>
<p>It is also such a beautiful spring, people have replaced the bleakness of winter with a fresh breath of air. Axiang felt that she would no longer shiver in the縮瑟 west wind, and the several parts of her hands that were frozen and cracked had also涨上了 red layers of new flesh. To a beautiful field, seeing the vigorous新生 in the beautiful field, ah, the spring of the season has arrived again!</p>
<p>She looked at the foothills on the opposite side, where a line of people was蠕动. Although she could not distinguish the outlines of these black shadows in detail. But she could be sure that it was definitely not the crowd commonly seen in this village.</p>
<p>When the shadows gradually approached, these young masters with飄着 ties and wearing coffee-colored spring clothes were separated by a few young ladies in silk scarves and short coats! Axiang felt very ashamed, thinking that she could never compare to these happy people. In their hands, they were carrying tripods, and on a tripod was the outline of this mountain view. Axiang saw that the colors painted on the paper were beautiful, and the lines of满幅靑兴绿 made people feel high in the spring, and these high哥儿 and miss, they all投了 attention to Axiang's eyes, Axiang only含羞地 bowed her head, in the middle of these people Axiang景渺小了.</p>
<p>In this village, these men and women appear every day, they come with a white paper铺着 on the画板, but when they return; they are always塗上了 bright colors. When they walked past Axiang's house, they always投过了 unusual eyes. Axiang also looked at the distant mountain scenery and the oil-green field under the fatigue of the day, at this time when it was almost evening. After three or four days like this, their eyes were熟练了; Axiang would no longer feel the possibility of shame.</p>
<p>So in Axiang's mind, a very deep mark was划上. In a dream one night, she saw herself also杂在 their team. But when she woke up from her dream, the East had already现鱼肚白了.

<p>— Written by George Gissing, translated by Sun Pu</p>
<p>Dear, anything is possible for Mr. Tiballi. How much he has changed, after his country life. It became like this. He has a beautiful little house in Bucks County. I can't help but think that my husband's death made him leave there. He was very good with Mr. Karlman. After my country life, it became like this. He has a beautiful little house in Bucks County. I really can't help but meet him by chance in London. Sister thought it must be about emotional troubles.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, her daughter阻着 saying. That's what you said, not me.</p>
<p>Is that so? Oh, maybe it is. Because it can be seen that he is troubled by something. Of course, maybe it's just out of pity for those poor people he is dedicated to. A strange person!</p>
<p>When the male voice rang at the door of the客室, Mrs. Ronin curiously looked at this strange gentleman. He finally walked in. A person of above average height, but his shoulders were quite bent forward; thin, not elegant, walking with hesitant steps, revealing a shy appearance; his thin gray eyes, with a very gentle expression, nervously looking here and looking there from under his neurotic眉下, and a humble smile floating on his lips. His hair was beginning to thin and turn gray, but he had a thick beard, which was more suitable for a strong相貎. When he walked into this house, Ronin could be said to have leaned in sideways, his hands constantly closing and opening, bringing out a laughable appearance. Although it cannot be said to be truly ragged, there were some places lacking luster and neatness, which made him different from ordinary people; approaching him, it could be seen that his black clothes were of the style of several years ago. His linen shirt was quite neat, but other than a small black饰扣 on the chest and equally simple寶石扣 on the hard sleeves, there were no more decorations. He湊 to a corner of the wall, if Mrs. Wei Er had not immediately放 a seat next to him, he would have seemed to be peacefully sitting there alone.</p>
<p>Mr. Tiballi, I hope you won't spend August in the city?</p>
<p>No, ah, no! No, I don't think so!</p>
<p>But you seem to be hesitating, please forgive me, I believe you must转地 one time. Indeed, your complexion is too bad. Can I persuade you to go to Lucerne with us? My husband will be very happy to talk to you about the European situation. Come with us for two weeks - be sure to come!</p>

<h3 id="e258">On Soviet Renowned Director Eisenstein's Film Script Theory <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Gaoyuan</p>
<p>In the preface to the film script "The Entire Line" (全綫), co-authored by Eisenstein and Alexandrov, Eisenstein expressed the following opinions regarding the form a film script should take, clarifying the scope of work for film scriptwriters and directors. Not long ago, our film industry also sparked a debate on whether the work of scriptwriters and directors should be handled by one person. Now, I will translate the main points below for reference.</p>
<p>A film script distinguished by numbers is as repetitive as the numbers arranged at the feet of corpses and cannot produce a film.</p>
<p>In essence, a film script is not the formation of material, but a stage in the process of material formation. A film script exists as a stage between a chosen theme digested by emotion (Temperament) and its visual embodiment.</p>
<p>A film script is not a stage script.</p>
<p>A drama, even without an effective stage performance, still has independent value. A drama still has the value of being a permanent reading material. Conversely, a film script seeks its own concretization in countless visual forms, a shorthand for emotional expression.</p>
<p>A film script is merely a bottle of wine that exists to suddenly pull the cork, allowing champagne-like emotions to flow into a parched throat.</p>
<p>A film script is a signal from one emotion to another.</p>
<p>The film scriptwriter gives the film script a perceptual rhythm with his unique technique.</p>
<p>The director participates in this, transplanting this perceptual rhythm into the director's own unique language, that is, the language of film.</p>
<p>Director 丨丨</p>
<p>Discovers the film's equivalent to that which should change the literary report.</p>
<p>The root of the problem lies here, not in the sequential order of shots or the continuous narrative of events in the script.</p>
<p>Our requirements for film scripts are simply this; this view strikes a fatal blow to the form of "shooting scripts" that have always been marked with numbers one by one.</p>
<p>The worst case for a film script is when it is written by an ordinary craftsman; such a film script is merely a repetitive and visual description of what is to be shown to the audience.</p>
<p>However, the secret lies in forming a chain of experiences to be presented to the audience through the film script.</p>
<p>When exploring the organized creation of such a film script, we then arrive at the form of the film novel.</p>
<p>According to this form, what we aim for is to clearly express in words on paper what will be provided on the screen丨丨, for example, by means of a herd of livestock, sunsets, waterfalls, or endless wilderness. Our so-called film novel is, in essence, the same as replicating the story that will greatly excite and move the audience who will see that film in the future. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e259">Review of "Wharf Angel" 丨Grand Theater丨 <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Although this is also based on the theme of a love triangle, this "Wharf Angel" should be outstanding among the many American films with the same theme.</p>
<p>We are not merely giving it a higher evaluation because everything expressed in the work is very close to the sentimental feelings of the Chinese people. On the contrary, if we carefully grasp the entire work, then we admit that the two directors of this drama have had a full understanding of the conflict and contradiction between love and friendship that the playwright wanted to express and have faithfully expressed them.</p>
<p>The conflict between friendship and love is perhaps a phenomenon that we can often see. However, what we should pay attention to now is the playwright's precise description of the story's development process, dramatically emphasizing each scene's psychological changes, which should be the first characteristic of this work. And all of these depend on the genuine skills of each actor, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Secondly, because the playwright first had a meticulous structure for the script, the dramatic connections between each scene and each scene clearly show the achievements of film art. Naturally, this is mainly due to the director's contributions. He gives us a clear and understanding feeling; no waste, no rambling, which is the characteristic of his expression methods.</p>
<p>Yes, from the director's montage, from the composition of the shots, from the description of the surrounding atmosphere, from the grasp of the drama's Tempo, and from the expression of the personalities of the characters in the drama, all aspects can prove that the director has rich creative experience and literary cultivation.</p>
<p>However, there are still some shortcomings in the story's development. For example, in writing about Toy and Como's night in the upstairs room, we don't feel that it is a deep and strong love, and this love occurs in a prostitute, so how Toy is loyal to love afterward inevitably makes people feel unnatural. This is to say that the previous setting is quite insufficient. Secondly, after Como is arrested, a very tragic climax could have been triggered from the prostitute Toy, such as shouting and crying as she watches him being taken into prison, which could give people a deeper impression, at least more powerful than the final scene of talking through the iron gate. However, this is the influence of American films, although this ending is not how happy, it also gives people a feeling of endless regret, but after all, it is not the ending method that this film should have.</p>
<p>However, this is a concrete expression of the playwright's ideology. It is very clear that in addition to the conflict between friendship and love, it also writes about the cruelty of the law. But that is by no means the theme, regardless of whether he also expresses dissatisfaction with the law. Therefore, if this point is used as the theme at the end, it will definitely give the audience the most profound and tragic impression from the law and the police. On the contrary, precisely because the playwright dares not attack the unreasonableness of the current social law, and also feels that prisons and the police are terrible things after all, he has to justify himself and explain it to mean that the person who sells his friend for a woman uses the bounty he got from the police station to hire a lawyer for the prisoner. That is to say, the law is always just, not to mention that it maintains the existence of the law. In addition, regarding the theme constituted by the conflict between friendship and love, the playwright emphasizes the internal conflict between the two friends, so he says that Duke's betrayal was entirely to vent his anger, not to covet the reward of one thousand yuan, which may not give us a more real feeling. Therefore, it also makes us think that this story conforms to the cliché that "no coincidence, no story." However, to say one more thing, this drama is quite close to the living feelings of the Chinese people.</p>

<p>— Gu Yue</p>
<p>"Pear Blossoms in a Rainstorm" is clearly a tragedy, a tragedy that satirizes life, even more profound and moving than the depiction in "Life."</p>
<p>Xiao Ying likes to eat bread, Xiao Qin likes to eat rice; Xiao Ying envies the brightly lit city, but Xiao Qin is blind, so Xiao Ying is ultimately seduced, which is a very good omen.</p>
<p>When Xiao Ying returns home to see her sister after being seduced, she is wearing silk clothes, but what her sister touches is cloth, which is clearly Xiao Ying deceiving her, but how can Xiao Ying think at this time that people are deceiving her in the same way that she is deceiving her sister? Life is originally a deception, which is a very good contrast and satire.</p>
<p>Speaking of the performance aspects, everyone inevitably has inappropriate expressions.</p>
<p>Xiao Ying's expression when she is seduced to Shi's house is extremely difficult. But she thinks about it scene by scene and can handle it, which is a success.</p>
<p>Xiao Qin is blind, and a blind person's eyes cannot move. Of course, everyone admits that Xiao Qin is a very difficult role to play. There are several inner expressions that are also quite successful.</p>
<p>Gao Zhanfei is beyond criticism because he is basically a supporting role, I think. He Feiguang is playing a villain, but he is not as good as Yuan Congmei's villain.</p>
<p>What we cannot forget the most is an unknown little sister inside, she has very lively expressions, I think she is promising, I hope the United Photoplay Service can cultivate her well.</p>
<p>"Pear Blossoms in a Rainstorm" depicts a pair of sisters, a pair of sisters with different ideas and different experiences, which has a satirical meaning compared to the Star Film Company's "Sisters Flowers." I believe that the plot of "Rainstorm Blossoms" is more profound and intense than "Sisters Flowers." At least! It can be called the "Sisters Flowers."</p>

<p>The night before was drizzling, and they were shooting a shot in a deep mountain forest for "The Enemy of Women."</p>
<p>Xu Qinfang, Gu Lanjun, and other female stars talked about ghosts. Just as they were talking enthusiastically, Xu Qinfang jumped her feet and shouted, "Please don't talk about it! I'm going to be scared to death!" The lively and playful Xiao Gu suddenly, without warning, raised her voice behind Xu Qinfang and imitated a ghost, scaring Xu Qinfang into a big jump. She smiled and sang about the drizzling rain, making people laugh so hard that they couldn't bend over. (Compensation)</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3 id="e263">The House of Rothschild (10) (6) <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Yin</p>
<p>Nathan listened to his brothers, pondered for a long time, and then declared: "Amschel, everything you say is correct..."</p>
<p>"...Your ideas are all right... Every word you say is reasonable... But丨 we must defeat Napoleon!" James asked in confusion: "What's the reason?" Nathan then stood up and calmly explained the reason. He said: "What's the reason? Because we are members of the Rothschild family... At present, we are not just five wealthy Jews seeking great opportunities. We need to know that the whole world knows that whether you are Jewish or not, Europe will not have peace until Napoleon is gone. This is a fact you cannot deny!" Gudula was overjoyed and leaned her body against Nathan. Then Nathan spoke again: "We must take some risks. We can only endure for a while 丨 and not be impulsed by some selfish desires and feelings 丨 to do our best for the benefit of the world. We can unite with Napoleon and let him continue to fight for ten or eight years. Our money can be used to buy weapons and blood, until the whole of Europe becomes a massacre ground 丨 but what benefits will the Jews get? Isn't it just a lifelong pawnshop business? We must not do that 丨 we must strive for peace, as before, but we must not help the war. If we must perish, we must perish with honor. We cannot leave any shame behind us 丨 no matter what position!"</p>
<p>After listening to Nathan's words, Gudula happily placed her withered hand on Nathan's hand and said, "My son, these are the words your father would have said." Then Amschel, Solomon, Carl, James, and the other four brothers seemed to suddenly realize something, looking at each other, their hearts filled with brotherly love and racial glory. Amschel was the first to say, "I agree with Nathan's words." The four of them rushed to shake hands with Nathan, and Carl patted him on the shoulder. Nathan was so emotionally overwhelmed that he couldn't speak, and he just swallowed the word "thank you." His eyes were wet with tears.</p>
<p>Led by Colonel Fitzroy, Prince Metternich, Duke Retland, and Duke Talleyrand actually lowered their status and visited the Jewish street in Frankfurt to visit Rothschild. Nathan formally received them, and everyone held a meeting. Metternich frankly expressed his shame to Nathan, saying, "Nathan, we know that we have treated you in many wrong ways. Now I can frankly say that we need your help." Retland stubbornly interjected, "That's not how it is said. The Allied countries are waiting to use money. We are not here to ask you to give alms. You are a lender, and we will give you interest." Nathan said, "Am I sure I want to lend money to you?" Solomon said from the side, "Austria is already bankrupt." James also said, "France is already in Napoleon's hands." Carl added, "Italy is no exception." Solomon said again, "What if Napoleon wins?" Metternich explained, "Of course, whatever you do, you always have to take some risks." (To be continued)</p>
