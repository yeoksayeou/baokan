<p>（南京）汪院長廿三晨在外部紀念週演講、題爲「破落户與暴發户」大意如下、「最近數月以來、國内思想界發生一個很嚴重的問題、便是中國何以衰落到這樣地步呢、何以如此委靡不振呢、這個問題、自然是因爲痛心國難而起、因爲痛心國難進而求解救國難的方法而起、解答此問題的一部份人說、這是中國民族喪失了自信力、忘記了自已有四千多年的文化、妄自菲薄根本上提不起勇氣、所以第一緊要是恢復中國民族的自信力、一部份人說這是中國民族缺少反省、因爲中國四千年的文化、比起歐洲來、實在低下、中國民族應該痛切反省、知道自已事事不如人、所以做成今日落後的地位、非加倍努力、不能滌除以前的罪孽、求得將來的進步、所以第一要緊是反省、獨立評論最近幾期、胡適之先生對於此點說得最爲痛切、中國古代的文化、比起歐洲古代的文化、最各有特色呢、還是低下呢、這個問題、讓給研究古代文化史的人去比較研究、於此不欲討論、但是中國是有自已的文化、是無可疑的、我於此不欲與歐洲有自已的文化的國家相提并論、只與一個沒有自已的文化的國家如日本相提并論、日本於維新以前是接受中國的文化、維新以後接受歐洲的文化、這是人所共見的、固然、日本人自已有他的武士道、大和魂、但是普通的說起來、日本維新以前、語言文字學術思想以至一切制度文物、都是由中國模倣得來、這是無可疑的、然則中國古代文化如果低下、那麽日本維新以前文化也不能不說低下、譬如胡適之先生所說的、中國古代傳來幾種罪孽、如纏小脚、打屁股等等、纏小脚、日本人雖然沒有模倣、至於打屁股、在刑法未改良以前、可不也是一樣的殘酷、然則爲什麽今日日本會强到這樣地步、中國會弱到這樣地步呢、我以爲解答此問題、比較的緊要、因爲國難的由來和解救的方法、或者於解答此問題、可以發現得一些出來、我欲解答這個問題、先做個比方、中國是破落户、日本是暴發户、每一圙中國人都會說、自已是一個大國、又是一個古國、所謂大、便是地方之廣、人民之衆、所謂古便是有四千年的文化、至於最近百年來、經濟文化樣樣落後、郤又是眼見的事實、無可隠諱的這種以往的光榮、和眼前日墮落、合併起來、恰恰成了一個破落户的心理、凡是破落户的子弟、他的門楣、總有些光祿第、太史第之類、他的祠堂總有油炸鬼式的旗杆、他的住宅、雖然陳舊不堪、腐敗無秩序、但也是廓廓大大的、他的家裹、當然有些破銅爛鐵、呌做周彜商鼎、他的祖宗神像、個個都是蟒袍綠帶、煊赫異常、所以這些破落户的子弟、卽使眼前破落、但他的心裹郤滿貯着過去的光榮、以爲目前雖然時衰運敗、我的家世是很高貴的、根基是很厚的、因此不期然而然的養成一種驕傲心理、這種心理、是很可惡的、也是很可恥的、他不是爲現在而驕傲、乃是爲過去而驕傲、這種驕傲的心理、又發生兩樣結果、其一是沒有誠意的比較、其二是沒有誠意的努力、爲什麽沒有誠意的比較呢、因爲他存了一種驕傲的心理、以爲自已祖宗傳來的事物、都是頂刮刮的、明明一件事物自已的遠不如人、也偏要說是自已的好、例如近代發明的醫學、他們會說不如他們老祖宗的黃帝内經以及醫宗金鑑、爲什麽沒有誠意的努力呢、也是因爲存了一種驕傲的心理、以爲我有我們的法了、我們的法子、用了四千多年、到現在還有四萬萬人口之衆、我們何必怕、又何必愁、所以每到危急存亡的時候、仍然抱着聽天由命的觀念、懶惰不堪、關冗無恥、所以一個破落户的子弟、遠不如一個白手起家的人那麽奮發有爲、因爲一個白手起家的人、他心中先沒有那一種驕傲心理、因此遇着一種事物、其美惡優劣、比較得淸楚、不至於把自已所有的雖臭亦香、人家所有的、雖好亦醜、比較得旣然淸楚、則舍短取長、自然容易堅决、其發奮有爲、遠不是破落户那種萎靡不振所能望其肩背、我們試舉一個例來說、當美國兵艦駛駛到橫濱的時候、日本全國上下是如何震動呢、他們感覺到自已所有的樹葉式的扁舟、萬萬不能和這鐵山般的兵艦相較、感覺到這個鐵山般的兵艦、來到橫濱、呑噬這些樹葉般的扁舟、如一條大鯊魚、呑噬小魚蝦一樣、完全沒有對抗、除了自已努力趕快做成鐵山般的兵艦、更沒有逃生之法、并且因兵艦而推想及其他一切制度事物、都作如是觀、舉一反三、作全般的改革、全國上下、一致努力、如醉如狂、因此做成了明治維新的光榮歷史、中國呢、如彭玉麟輩看見外國兵艦、還以爲不如自已的長龍快蟹、曾國藩呢、比較聰明些了、知道要做船廠了、但他不能舉一反三、以爲外國比較我們高明的、只不過是這些物質的進步、所以他的學說、衣鉢相傳做成</p>
<p>中國爲優、形而下之學泰西爲優」、支配了幾十年、這幾十年中、讓日本飛行絶迹、中國却膛乎其後、我以爲中國這幾十年的落後、除了滿洲專制、袁世凱及南北大小軍閥之作惡、爲其巨梗之外、這種心理是阻滯進步的一大原因、這種心理、現在已掃除了麽、據我看來、現在絲毫沒有掃除、試舉一個小小的例爲證、現在江浙等處苦旱、便有人發起求雨、先舉行於鄉村、繼之而舉行於世界交通地點的上海、舉行於鄉村呢、我們已不勝其慚愧了、因爲中國興辦學校、至少也有了四五十年的歷史、鄉村之間已有小學校等等了、何以連這種關於水旱的常識、也不能普及於鄉民、至於舉行於世界交通地點的上海、我們不但慚愧而且憤懣、難道他們眞不知道水旱的常識嗎不是的、他們做這種舉動、有幾個動機、其一是、求雨是我們老祖宗傳下來的、老祖宗的方法總沒有錯、其二、求雨比救災來得輕鬆、簡而易行、聚集一些佛爺天師、搖頭幌腦、像煞有趣、旣可取悅於人、又無損於已、所以發起一個求雨會、人人鼓掌贊成、如果改做江浙的救災公債、要置備種種防止旱潦的科學設備、那就不見得人人鼓掌贊成了、這種僥倖的心理、由懶惰的心理所做成、而這種懶惰的心理、又是破落户子弟所同具、我以爲我們中國人民如果不能痛切的掃除此種心理、連救一時的水旱也做不到、更說不到救幾十年鬰積而來的國難、兄弟以爲我們今日、兩隻眼睛應該向前、不應該顧後、換句話說、我們應該努力現在、邁步將來、不應該回戀過去、從前法國都魯士有一段故事、都魯士城外、有許多野鵝、某夜敵兵來襲城時、守城兵士正在睡覺、虧得野鵝怪呌起來、守城兵士因此驚醒、將敵兵擊退、於是這些野鵝成爲救國的偉大人物、受人尊敬、但是幾十年後這些野鵝、被人宰割了、當被宰割之時、這些野鵝極口的呌不平、說我們的祖宗、有救城的功勳、今日何故宰割我們、那宰割的人說、你們祖宗有功勳、是你們祖宗的事、至於你們只配供人宰割、哼、破落户子弟聽者、祖宗的光榮與我們何干、祖宗的光榮、不能洗刷我們的恥辱、我們的恥辱、却可以埋沒祖宗的光榮、我們如果只知道回顧、以前的光榮、那麽、我們只有陷於都魯士被宰割的鵝的境遇、白手固可以起家、破落户何嘗不可以中興、只要除掉了驕傲的心理、比較得淸楚、努力的去做、做成一個現代的國家、這是現在救亡圖存的唯一方法、而發掦祖宗文明也就於此解决了」（二十三日專電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日美不侵犯條約之前程敬</h3>
<p>倫敦海軍軍縮預備會議。以英美日各持已見。技術上之主張旣各不同。軍縮之根本認識。亦復歧異。已覺無從調解。而際此時間。預備軍縮談判。遂至萬五千噸之主力艦兩艘。於是更引起軍備競爭之復。預備軍縮談判。遂至不能不延期矣。日本對於此次會議。意本欲打破華盛頓倫敦兩次海軍條約之限制。故於倫敦預備會議時。使專門委員。遲遲其行。而會議擱淺之後。日海軍大佐岩下。卽離開倫敦。直赴華盛頓。與美國當局非公式交換意見。促成日美間事實上之諒解。更擬試探美國之意。以圖締結日美互不侵犯條約。惟其事有可異者。前次蘇聨對日提議不侵犯條約。日人曾加拒絶。何以今次對美又欲結同樣性質之條約耶。其意蓋不外兩端。</p>
<p>（一）日本欲乘此時機。亟圖太平洋覇權之穩定。當美國承認菲列濱獨立之時。日本輿論卽竭力加以督促。冀使美國放棄在遠東之軍事防禦。日本可擴大其所謂勢力範圍。以便其商業經濟。由菲律濱而伸入南洋各屬。緣日荷會商。已漸趨僵局。英日經濟關係。又無法和解。設令菲利濱獨立。能早日成功。則日本可多一種操縱工具。故表面上高揭門户開放主義竭力示好於美取得外交上便利。以打開其當前對外貿易之難關。</p>
<p>（二）美國經濟之發展。在歐洲已感阻塞。遠東尤難進取。惟在其門羅主義下之南美。尙可縱橫自如。商業上各事業之投資。已超過英國舊有勢力之上。但自一九二九年恐慌發生以後。南美諸國痛受打擊美國輸出。乃亦逐年减少。迄至去年。竟較前减低百分之八十以上。而日本對南美輸出。則逐年增加。且與英國相呼應。以極廉之價傾消。抵制美國。於是美國對南美貿易。更大衰落。同時日本在遠東已取獲所謂優先利益。近由台灣總督召開華南領事會議。所有議案。莫不以發展對華南貿易爲中心。直言之卽欲操縱華南貿易。阻止美國之更進。日人對待美國之手段如此。而今猶以不侵條約爲言者。是不過敷衍美國緩和美國空氣之一煙幕耳。</p>
<p>且事實之發展猶不止此。圖田内閣成立以後。新五相會議已於十四日開始。其最初之議題爲如何設法廢除海軍五五三比率。實現軍備平等之要求。并在實際上擴大海軍之力量。日人唯一之口實。厥爲本國海外貿易已次第進展至於全世界。是以應有充分之海軍力。及空軍力以爲海外航綫等之保護。日人又擬擴展其海上防綫。以橫須賀爲中心。劃一二千海里之半徑圈。爲其軍事防禦之範圍。如是則南進將踰關島而迫近澳洲。西南越台灣而窺香港。西儣進由佐世保而及於上海矣。</p>
<p>顧日本又深知專事軍擴。必惹起列强之疑忌。而近代戰爭之勝負。亦必决於經濟準備之强弱。故齋藤内閣時之農相。卽高倡農村產業組合中心論。以喚起自力更生之經濟運動。又提倡農村自給自足。以爲非常事變之準備。至於工商業方面。亦樹立一貫的統制經濟方針。制經濟方針。制定種種法令。以爲實行統制之根據。此以純粹經濟的立塲而論。泃不免有阻碍產業發展之嫌。然爲軍事準備計。則固爲必然之現象也。岡田内閣組成後。猶以前者爲未足。更進一步而提倡「統一的國家經濟政策。」强化原有之法令。而佇候戰禍之襲來。由是乃更可見所謂「日美不侵犯條的」者。特一日人敷衍外交之工具而已。聰明如美人。必不爲其所紿也。</p>
<h3>美國大盜伏誅</h3>
<p>芝加哥美國最著名悍匪狄林格屢犯殺人越貨巨案、而爲當局懸賞通緝者、今日在芝加哥北邊某劇塲觀「俠客」影片旣畢、有女子二人追隨左右、相率出院、是時政府官吏已得密報、派警察多人候於門外、歷二時半之久、一見狄氏出外、卽舉槍射擊、狄氏不及抵抗、身受重傷、一彈洞穿其頭、一彈擊中其胸、當卽倒地殞命、左右兩女子有一受傷、旋乘擾攘之際躍入車中逃去、</p>
<p>又電據目覩者云、伏於劇塲外以待狄林格者、計者警察十五人、狄氏出院時、舉目四望、旣覺有伏、卽探手入袋、取出手槍、但警察槍彈已發、狄氏卽倒斃於影戲院旁之一衖中云、官塲在影戲院檢騐狄氏之屍時、查　狄氏較前健壯、已留鬚、而剃云其眉、胸前有槍彈、創痕、係新近醫愈者、官塲欲得其指印、但查見指尖之皮已磨平無餘、殆用鏹水所致也、</p>
<p>又電此間偵探長柏維斯星期六夜得密報據謂星期晚狄林格將至影戲院觀劇、偵探長乃於影戲院四週密佈暗探、而自已停車於戲院附近、親自視察、目覩狄氏購票入院、影戲映畢、狄氏趨出、當走過其車時、偵探長一聲暗號、密探四集、狄氏卽驚覺奔入一衖中、一面㧞出手槍、但衖中早有密探、狙伏、不待狄氏開槍、密探已先前制人、狄遂倒地而死、據偵探長稱、渠本擬生擒其人、但恐其抗拒到底、故不得不擊其要害、偵探長又謂狄氏而部本有一疤、可資辨識、但此疤已用外科手術除去云、當地警察稱、狄氏出院時、並未有女子與之同行、（二十二日路透電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）軍民聨合調查委員、研究美國空防報吿、已由該委員會主席裴開爾向陸軍部長鄧恩提出、其中最要之建議、卽爲美國陸軍航空隊至少應派遣一隊在阿拉斯加演習常年飛行、遠東現狀如此、而美國海陸軍近復有在亞留申羣島開闢飛行根據地之議、因此陸軍飛行人員前往阿拉斯加實習之建議遂引起深切之注意、調查委員會報吿、認陸軍飛行隊不甚滿意、有改組之必要、俾得成爲世界上最强之空軍、該報吿稱、美國海軍及民營航空可稱無敵、惟陸軍飛行隊相差甚遠、其咎槪在國會之遷延云、調查委員會由人民代表六人及陸軍軍官五人組成、主席裴開爾曾任戰時陸長、該委員會宣稱、現狀嚴重、未容忽視、因提出建議如下、</p>
<p>（一）擴充陸軍航空隊至飛機二千三百二十架、</p>
<p>（二）决定國家航空永久政策、</p>
<p>（三）保存現在制度、但陸軍與空軍須有更密切之聨絡、惟合併海陸軍之航空隊、另行設置航空部、則認爲經費過鉅、不切實用、</p>
<p>（四）鼓勵飛機製造業、並准其從速發展、以適合戰時之需求、</p>
<p>（五）修改空軍内部組織、如增加航空人員之飛行鐘點、自每年一百二十句鐘或二百句鐘至三百句鐘、並添置適用飛機上之設備、以備增加冒險飛行訓綀之用、</p>
<p>（六）制定改善實騐及發展之寛大政策、</p>
<p>（七）增加航空隊軍官四百零三人、</p>
<p>調查報吿稱、空軍擔任航空郵運時失事之敎訓、頗有價値、空軍擔任航空郵運一月、駕駛員喪生者共十二人、但該報吿讚美空軍在惡劣狀况下服務之勇氣、此間威信調查報吿將爲空軍新政策之根據、該報吿大部份由裴開爾經三月之詳細研究後擬就、在此期間、調查委員會會員視察空軍根據地、調查案卷、及聆取證人意見、頗爲繁劇、委員會於四月十日成立、四月十七日開始實際工作、十月前猶從事調查、證人被訊者有李根巴區大佐等多人、李氏爲戰時名飛行家謂美國飛機工業需時七月、始能符合戰時需求、林白前因不滿政府取消航空郵運合同、曾拒絶參加委員會、惟亦接受委員會之邀請、陳述意見、（二十二日國民電）</p>

<h3>條陳修改意見</h3>

<h3>顏魯卿詐財恐嚇案</h3>
<p>詐財與恐嚇兩案合併審理各證人供述恐嚇六萬經過｜昨已訊結定二十三日上午宣判｜</p>
<p>法租界愛多亞路薛邁羅事務所刦案中之嫌疑人瑞昌順五金號主張祖明·莊源大小主莊繼孟·五金跑街汪蓮友·大德醫院院長唐慶岳·等四人、解經第二法院審辦中、發覺原吿代表律師顏魯卿有向唐慶岳之家屬索詐二千元嫌欵、旋經法捕房警務處在第二特院向顏魯卿提起公訴、奉諭辯論終結、定於二十三日宣判各情、已請前報、茲悉前日又有瑞昌順主張祖蔭即張祖明之兄·又莊源大莊繼孟之岳父張予權·先後</p>
<h3>至法捕房</h3>
<p>報稱、律師顏魯卿·曾於六月十八日偕同薛邁羅事務所買辦周景賡前來商人等處、要索私訴損失六萬元、請求提交等情、於是捕房將全案人證傳訊一過、昨晨、將一干人證傳至第二特院、經熊彙萍推事偕陶書記官升座第一刑庭、將瑣案訊畢、於十一時、將顏傳案、熊推事諭曰、對於唐慶岳控顏魯卿之公訴、本於今日宣判、爲因有張祖蔭張予權等之吿發案、應將辯論終結撤消、重開辯論、</p>
<h3>合併審理</h3>
<p>諭畢、遂出捕房律師費席珍陳述前情、官向顏曰、你是否向他們要過六萬元、顏答、六月十八日、吾在捕房寫字間遇見趙忠迪其人、他說來保張祖明的、但因張已承認爲盜、於是捕房不要他保、照捕房方面、亦將他扣留一宵、他又說張·莊·二人决不爲盜、對承認爲盜一點、他極奇、即呌我們去看看他們兩人之店大不大等語、旋趙先行出外、而我與周景賡亦出外、只見趙候在我們汽車旁、趙說要到莊源大去、邀我們同去、於是我們即同去、及</p>
<h3>至瑞昌順</h3>
<p>目的地、趙先下車、他說要進去借打電話、呌我們進去坐等、我說不方便的、趙說有我在、不妨事的、故我們無意中跟進去、由趙即向店伙說、他們就是失主與代表律師、店伙等即問周被刦情形、稍候片刻、張祖蔭即來店中、彼此互通姓名、但其時我始終未發一言、嗣後趙又領我們至莊源大去看看、及至該處、趙先下車進去、我們仍在外觀看、旋有張予權出來招呼、邀我們進去、惟我與張予權素識、其時他說繼孟</p>
<h3>是他女婿</h3>
<p>他又說張祖明與莊繼孟係屬親戚、張何以要咬莊爲盜、又問周究竟損失若干、我即答復被刦情形、至此、官命傳各證人上堂、逐一訽明年籍、遂諭隔别訊問、先訊周景賡如何與趙忠迪遇見後、如何先後到張·莊·兩家情形、周答詞與顏相同、官命傳趙忠迪、問爾如何到捕房去的、答、我至捕房、欲證明張祖明决不爲盜、且欲擔保、問、爾與顏·周·兩人相識否、答、平時不相識、係在捕房時認得的、我對他們說張祖明</p>
<h3>决不爲盜</h3>
<p>况他們店是很大的、問、是否爾陪他們先後到瑞昌順·莊源大·去的、答、有的、我由捕房出來、顏·周·兩人隨後跟出、問我何處去、我說到百老匯路去、他們說有汽車邀我同去、他們在車上向我說、去年被刦與今年被刦、共損失六萬元、他們又說江北人刦去還可、被小開們搶去、此筆賬要向他們算的、又說請你趙先生帮帮忙、我答可以的、問此言何人說的、答、顏·周·兩人同說的、先至瑞昌順時、我先進去打電話、一方面由張祖蔭與顏等談話、祇聞</p>
<h3>要六萬元</h3>
<p>及一萬元、旋即爭吵、他們所說何言、未聽淸楚、結果、又聞張祖蔭說祖明如果爲盜、應當辦他、顏等即與分别出外、後他們又呌我伴往莊源大去、及至該處、他們談話、我未聽見、僅聞張予權說、我未與女婿會面、如何情形、尙未得知、不能還答等語、故又分别出外、官向顏魯卿問曰、爾在車中是否向赴說過被刦損失否、顏答、我與周坐在前面、趙與周之姪見周菊順坐在後面、祇見趙在汽車内打磕銃、並未說過閒話、又訊張祖蔭稱、六月十八日早晨、我爲胞弟事至虹口捕房</p>
<h3>調查事實</h3>
<p>及返店、見顏等已先我而來、先與他們互換名片、我即問來此何爲、他們說你弟爲盜、已成鐵案、今日到來、爲顧全爾的面子、且减少爾弟精神痛苦起見、還是私了的好、我問如何私了、他們說先後共刦二萬餘元、如出六萬元、即可了結、我說此案是捕房提起公訴、何能私了、他說不要管他、你如能出資、即可了、我又說無此巨欵、他們又說那沒二家各出三萬元不爲多、我說我弟未見面、不知如何情形、如果</p>
<h3>確實爲盜</h3>
<p>捕房不辦、我也要辦他、决不願以錢買盜名、他們又說數額少些亦可、我說莊家如出五萬五千元、我們五千元亦不肯出、但他們仍纒繞不休、我即呌他們出去、詎他們臨去時、又說如不拿六萬元出來、使你舖子不能開、當時趙忠迪向我說、你能够出幾錢、給他們幾錢、我答一錢不出、並囑他回絶他們的、至此、官命傳趙忠迪問曰、爾有無向張說過能否出幾錢給他們麽、趙答、未曾說過、官向張等謂曰、何以爾等答詞不符、又訊張予權稱、六月十八日八時許、接得電話、說女婿莊繼孟</p>
<h3>爲盜嫌疑</h3>
<p>我即至莊源大調查、及至十時、據人說有人在瑞昌順開談判、要六萬元、移時即來我處、及我下樓、見顏律上師、乃是前在上海公墓相識的、即問其何事、他說繼孟爲盜我說繼孟是我女婿、呌他辦事愼重、其時周景賡要六萬元即可了事、我問如何要六萬元、他說去年與今年被刦、又利息損失、及新票換舊鈔票、又交際費、又釘梢費、我說我是商家、你是法律家、民事可了、刑事</p>
<h3>如何可了</h3>
<p>顏答可以設法的、我說如女婿爲盜、我亦可辦他的、若說墊錢二字、不必談、至此、他們即怏怏而去、嗣後又來二次電話、但我無圓滿答復、官問顏曰、有無其事、顏答復有的、他們所說完全是假的、官問莊繼孟曰、顏·周·等來談判、爾不知道否、莊答、我其時適在押、故不知情、又據證人杜雪璋·夏振祥·湯祥瑞·蔡松茂·劉吉甫·烏世昌·張鴻逹·劉蔚芳·李其孫·張桂卿·張夢華·等上堂證明顏·周兩人</p>
<h3>前來要索</h3>
<p>惟内有二證人言詞、略有不符、又據人周菊順稱、商人在薛邁羅事務所供職、於六月十八日商人在捕房時、雖與顏律師等一同坐汽車至瑞昌順·莊源大·去、僅在外面等候、問、在汽車中他們說過話否、答、祗聞我叔即周量賡向趙忠迪說、做小開的、要搶我們的錢、那麽、我們生意不好做了、惟顏與趙未曾說過話、乃趙在車中打磕銃、又向正探目張子楹訊問一過、至此、時已鐘鳴二下、官諭暫時休息、</p>
<h3>三時續訊</h3>
<p>遂吿退庭、及至三時半繼續開庭、即由陶書記官將各證人供詞誦讀一過、官命開始辯論、先由捕房律師聲述一過、繼據顏魯卿辯稱、今日到案各證人之言詞、完全不實、且係不符、致於虚搆事實之利益、乃欲以我爲犧牲品、天下那有如此笨人、在他們七八十店伙人衆、恐嚇詐財之事、如有事實、早可報捕、可見是日完全係普通答話、此事使無論何人、不能信也、况我</p>
<h3>身充律師</h3>
<p>豈有了結公訴之事、即使他們付我六萬元、呌我如何了此公訴、致於張予權、前次他說與我在聖約翰大學同學、且係梵王渡俱樂部同會會友相識、今日又說在上海公墓認得、以此點而觀、顯見前後言詞不實、但我與趙同去瑞昌順·莊源大·實出好奇心、且係環境所致、請宣吿無罪、並由王士宗·張善樂·二律師代辯一切、熊推事諭以辯論終結、定於本月二十八日上午十一時宣判、訊畢時、已五點鐘矣</p>

<p>檢騐外輪交涉、在前任局長時、由航政局辦理、茲以是項交涉、關於外交、故已由交部直接主辦、目下外輪之已受航政局檢騐、亦已有數起、如亞細亞火油輪船等、惟較大輪舶、尙未受我方檢騐、交部以外輪檢騐、關於我國主權至鉅、故已分頭進行、俾早日解决、至國輪自受航政局檢騐以來、成績甚佳、以檢騐輪舶、於航行安全上至有關係也、</p>
<h3>收回航權</h3>
<p>至於收回内河航權問題、各地航商曾向交部籲請、交部亦以内河航權之收回、於國家主權、關係甚大、但是項交涉、並非空言所能奏效、上次交部在京召開航政會議時、對此問題、曾加以討論、决議由交通部辦理、刻下進行程度、局方未知其詳、總之、此問題與國人經營航務之發展、關係至鉅、交部决積極進行云云、</p>

<p>石廓小人查無其事</p>
<h3>閔行鎭實地訪問記</h3>
<p>江濱撈得小人屍長不滿三寸恐係變態生理所致謠傳不確前日報載閔行北首杏桃塢地方有農民蔣阿根之子根福、至龍隠寺畔刈草、在附近石廓中瞥見兩小人躍出、一長五寸、一長三寸、根福設法追捕、五寸長者被其兎脫、三寸長者不愼踏斃云云、自此消息刋佈後、道途流傳、咄咄稱怪、華東社記者爰於昨日親往閔行調查、得悉此事與外傳絶不相符、茲將詳情、分誌如次、</p>
<h3>事出有囚</h3>
<p>報載發現小人之地點、係在閔行鎭北首之杏桃塢地方龍隱寺畔、因此記者於車抵北橋後、即遍詢該處鄉民、有無杏桃塢地方、以及曾否聞及石廓小人之事、該處鄉民、對此茫然不知所謂、據謂杏桃塢旣不悉其在何處、而石廓小人之事、此處距離閔行密邇、亦竟毫無所聞、故認報載消息、係不可靠、而記者詢其閔行鎭有否放生局時、更搖首而謂、閔行方面、絶對無放生局之組織、記者聞此答語、不覺大爲失望、因思出事地點、旣在閔行、必須至閔行實地調查、方能明悉、因復驅車至閔行鎭、向滬閔長途汽車站内之職員詢問、據該職員之答覆、則確事出有因查無實據也、</p>
<h3>傳說紛紛</h3>
<p>當記者向該職員詢問時、該職員即知記者所詢、必係石廓小人之事、即謂足下此來、可謂虚此一行矣、蓋石廓小人、根本乃無此事、所謂小人者、乃即人家之私生子、三寸云云、絶不可靠、此處旣無放生局、惟鎭東浦濱、有一救生局、所謂石廓小人者、即在此處發生、君欲明白内容、儘可親往一詢也、該職員言竟、記者方頷首稱謝詎座旁有一鄉人堅謂石廓小人、確有其事、並謂彼之鄰居、有親見及之者、上述兩說、遂使記者懐疑莫釋、蓋以出事地點之閔行鎭上、猶復傳說紛紜莫衷一是、更無怪相距數十里遙之上海市矣、</p>
<h3>實地調查</h3>
<p>但因旣得救生局之綫素、遂即遵囑而往、該局在閔行鎭東、汽車不能直逹、記者乃舍車而步、行凡半里許、始抵其地、所謂救生局者、事實上業已停止工作、蓋該處在數年以前、雖屬救生局、今則已爲居户、故門前初無任何標識、該局位居上海縣公安局第一分局之東側、北爲閔行醫院、前爲浦江、地處江濱、空氣頗佳、記者至時、門首竚立婦人及稚予、乃即根據報載、詢問貴處有否沈善山先生其人、婦人聞言、即頷首稱是、即行持片通報、並肅記者小坐、</p>
<h3>兩旬前事</h3>
<p>移時、沈善山君出而接見、記者乃以報載爲詢、沈君即謂報章所載、實屬似是而非、所謂小人、確有其事、若云石廓内躍出、則完全信口雌黃也、當兩旬以前、右鄰蔣阿根之子根福、在浦濱閒眺、忽見水面浮起一物、細加讅視、乃爲一長不滿三寸之孩屍、耳目口鼻、完全畢具、於是異而撈起、事爲余知、乃即設法保管、蓋以此種孩屍、形體之小、得未曾有、即使婦人懷孕未足月而生產、但亦無如此細小、而竟五官完全者、故乃貯於瓶中、浸以火酒、惟因孩屍皮肉、當時已現靑紫、復且遂漸黝黑、遂即曝之日中、使爲人臘、現則貯於盒中、君欲一觀、儘可出示也、</p>
<h3>小人異狀</h3>
<p>據沈君謂、此種孩屍、謂其希罕、則未見希罕、則亦確屬希罕、蓋孩屍之長、不及一指而眉目口眼、乃皆完全、當撈得之際、余會以十倍之顯微鏡細加檢視、則小小兩腿之間、腎嚢等等畢具、即其背後肛門、亦有一細微小孔、實與常人形態、毫無少異、惟其頭部、則就其全體而觀、似覺過大、此外臍中胞帶、亦未剪斷、尙復拖出於外故綜觀全屍、實爲一細小之男性屍軀、此種屍軀、苟非變態生理所致、决不致此、但若此種之變態生理、則亦初未聞見也、</p>
<h3>出示遺骸</h3>
<p>沈君言竟、乃出示小人之遺軀、軀貯長方形之紙盒中、揭蓋而視、則確有一具雛形之孩屍、皮肉早已腐盡、惟臍以下尙餘黑而且乾之皮肉、因已曝曬、無復腐氣、孩屍頭部長約六分、眼眶鼻峯、了然可辨、口則張開、上下唇絶巨、有似獮猴、不類當人口腔、胸部肋骨絶細、臍畔胞帶、仍復拖延於外、兩手兩足、骨骼顯然、且手指足指、亦皆無缺、惜皮肉業已腐盡耳、記者等本携有照相機在、但因孩屍過小、且屍身色澤攝影亦難淸晰、致未能如願、綜觀孩屍全狀、確屬少見、惟依此觀察、定係鄉人變態生育所致、當時必因認爲不祥、因即棄諸江中、乃適被人撈獲、好事之徒、並又故爲裝點、於是以訛傳訛、遂有石廓小人之無稽傳說也、</p>

<h3>讀書消息｜申報流通圖書館讀書指導部編</h3>
<p>要目</p>
<p>這點也算經騐嗎周筠揮汗讀書與揮汗工作信筒三件</p>
<p>這點也算經騐嗎？周筠</p>
<p>經騐二字，在不同的生活國裏，有不同的内容，一個人說出自已的經歷，在不同生活環境的人，或許感不到興趣，但對於自已生活環境相同的人是會受到非常感動的。不僅如此，不同生活圈内的經歷，只要其文字是出於至誠，我想，這正是提供大家認識社會各面的一種良好媒介，對於生活抱着嚴肅熊度的人，是不會不注意自已生活圈以外的生活的。</p>
<p>我來叙述我個人讀書的經騐。</p>
<p>每次當我從圖書館借到或實的一本心愛的新書來，心裏總愉快得什麽似的，預算着要把這本書怎樣的熟諳，怎樣的了解這本書的内容，怎樣的第一遍記明書中的精華，第二遍再扎記出來，怎樣五天讀完第一遍，八天讀完第二遍，怎樣支配一些時間，在百忙中，怎樣利用整個公餘的時候，……可是，當我把工作擺佈了或是公餘要想看書的時候，總嫌機械聲響的嘈雜，心境悶挹不寗而不能聚精會神，不是第一遍就媽虎從事，就是完全失望，不能展卷。結果是限期很快的到了，甚至展無可展，讀的書却仍舊停滯在第二遍卷首。自已買的更是讀不到完本，或又被其他書籍吸引而將這書擱置。至於印象呢？郤像晴空裏的輕烟，幽光裏的暗影似的糢糊了。</p>
<p>這主因當然可說是由於環境的不良，但缺乏適當的生活鍜錬也是一個重要的原因。</p>
<p>我在失望之餘回味本攔發表過的「流動生活者讀書論」及「環境滿足了，是不想讀書的，……」「等待優裕的環境讀書，無異於等待天上落下元寳來……」的鍼言，我又不禁萬分慚愧。我們這種生活的人，我想，生活的鍜鍊是比讀書更重要，同時要把讀書作爲一種生生活的鍜鍊。我覺得我們每日只有一時至三時空閒的人，不必「博覽羣書」，只消在我們自學的學科中擇上幾本正確而値得一讀的書，隨時去細細地玩味，同時把書中的理論，運用到實際生活的各方面去。這二月來我這樣做云，覺得有許多進步的地方。</p>
<p>因此，敬獻於我們的朋友。</p>
<h3>一週間</h3>
<p>（一）揮汗讀書與揮汗工作：一週内接到讀者對於我們「因天熱辦公時間無形縮短」表示抗議的來信不下十多封了。他們大半都是每日工作十二小時的人，在十二小時生活後，他們還要讀書，寫信。憇暑自然不是這一生活圈所夢想的。他們責備我們不應該也像闊人一樣，不能揮汗工作，他們說：「做一個大衆的敎師是應部着大衆受苦的。我們的責備也許是太苛刻了一點，但對於自已很親近的人，似乎也不必客氣罷？」我們接到這些來信後，眞是汗顏夾背。我們召集了全體工作人員，聚談了一次。結果大家都願意延長些工作時間。於是大家很興奮的來「揮汗工作」，我們的工作室也因之緊張起來了。但是，一切出於自願，並不勉强在工作時間以外加多工作，而工作人員郤無一人不自願自動的去完成每日應做的事。這一項消息登出，我們不是自飾而是要說明我們的生活很願意與讀者的生活相配合。我們更希望讀者常常有這樣的責備與督促。</p>
<h3>信筒</h3>
<p>（一）八月一日一律改用本部製印的通信箋：八月一日快到了。讀者中凡未買好讀者通信箋的，請於一週内備好，以便通信應用。每本百頁，只收成本費大洋二角，郵購外埠加寄費五分，本埠二分。郵票十足通用。本館發售在收費處。</p>
<p>（二）寫信前要先塡好通信箋上各項空白：統一通信箋的目的，原爲調查讀者的生活，便於統計，齊一起見。現在有許多讀者雖然改用了通信紙，郤勿略了應塡各項。等於讀者自備紙無異。這與我們的目的完全相反。相在特請大家注意，以後不要再忽略了。這是第二次的通吿。</p>
<p>（三）不覆信的原因：我們對於來信，祇要是以讀書或知識探討的性質見詢，而我們的能力又能自信，是沒有不答覆的事實。至於延長至半月，一月間或亦有，但覆總是覆的。凡不覆的信大槪是談到範圍以外去，或者太專門了。無法找到相當的人代答，也祇好不覆了。凡屬於我們能力不能覆的信，我們另外還有通知。至於所指的「範圍」，讀者一檢我們過去的工作就可明悉。這不是我們固意迥避實際，是我們的地位本來如此。我們原是代讀者解除求知的一方面的任務爲任務的啊！</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>然後另外由一個人打自的箱籠裏去找些比較値錢的衣服或用具出來，悄悄地溜出後門去，向當舖裏當上幾十兩銀子，再回來聞發那些太監。有時候他們自已家裏實在無物可當了，不免就把太后所賜下的東西帶出去暫當一當。所以太后越是賞賜得殷勤，伊的親戚便越是窮下去、這還有什麽辦法呢？我曾經冷眼從旁細細觀察，這些情表，太后必然也是很明白的；因爲受累的人很多，伊的耳目又是十分的周密，一切極微細的事情，尙且有人去吿訴伊，何况這些較大的情節？那末伊究竟爲着什麽緣故，要這樣想入非非的去陷害伊的親戚呢？這個問題除了伊自已，怕就沒有人能够解答的了！</p>
<p>做皇親國戚的人竟有如此苦法，讀者大槪是不曾意料到的吧！我可以再寫一些給你們看看：大凡和皇上或太后做親戚的，至少總有一個爵位，有了爵位，便得竭力的維持塲面，卽一衣一物之微，也不能過於惡劣；然而他們實在是沒有什麽錢，可是怕得罪太后起見，他們又不得不省吃省用的把所有的力量，全集中在維持空塲面上。這種痛苦，平常人家是永遠想不到的！其實太后的錢正多着咧！我們不用說國家的庫銀，便是太后自已的私蓄，至少也有好幾百萬：伊只須輕輕援一根汗毛，就可以救濟伊的那些親戚，而且又不須動用朝廷的公欵，誰敢批評一句！無奈伊自已不屑舉一舉手啊！我對於伊這種幸災樂禍，毫無慈悲心的行爲，實在非常的不滿。</p>
<p>我們的同伴中，還有一位是元大奶奶。（譯者按：元大奶奶並不是姓「元」，元是伊的小名。伊的父親，便是本書中要角之一｜内務府大臣慶善）。這個人却有一段很特别的歷史，也可以說是一段很慘痛的歷史。（八九）</p>
<h3>三子的公式</h3>
<p>— 閒鐵</p>
<p>社會事業，减少而衰落的原因，多由於一般富翁闊老，把全力用在家庭，謀全福的利益，全福的名稱，就是想多福，多壽，多男。換句話說，福是鈔票，壽是鬚，男是子孫，所以時刻腦筋裏轉念頭是：</p>
<p>銀子！</p>
<p>兒子！</p>
<p>鬍子！</p>
<p>據信任命運，靠八字的經騐家說，人們的欲壑，絶對塡不滿，而且要想三子完全，難若登天。除非帶着九分九的獃氣，或者可以逹到美滿目的。像現代這些凸進凹出，尖銳的頭顱，雖然勉强成功，總逃不了以下無疑的三種公式：</p>
<p>（一）有美髯鬍子，傳代兒子，一定缺少銀子。</p>
<p>（二）有萬能銀子，美好鬍子，一定缺少兒子并</p>
<p>（三）有傳代兒子，萬能銀子，一定缺少鬍子。</p>
<p>｜｜要得三子全除非大獃子｜｜</p>
<p>｜｜乘子想三子卽是眞獃好｜｜</p>
<h3>夫妻相打</h3>
<p>— 張慕良</p>
<p>隔壁的阿六哥和阿六嫂在吃夜飯的時候，不知爲了一句什麽話，大家口角起來了。</p>
<p>我來是不管閒事的，可是他們這次的口角實在太厲害了，於是我就勸了他們幾聲，那知我一去，他們吵得更是厲害，一言不對，大家不管三七念一的打起架來了！</p>
<p>阿六哥抖擻了精神，如猛虎一般的撲到阿六嫂的面前，就是一拳，阿六嫂負了痛，豈肯示弱，也是張牙舞爪的混在一處交戰起來，可是阿六嫂那裏打得過阿六哥呢，於是阿六嫂嘴裹喊着「好，浮屍！你打！你打······」只有朝後退去，伊忽然拿着了一隻飯碗，就對準阿六哥的頭上擲過去，只聽得撲的一聲阿六哥頭上的血一滴一滴的流下來了！我看他們打得這樣，心裏只是突突的跳着，所以我也想用力的去拉開他們，誰知還沒有拉開，我的手腕却給阿六哥誤打了一下，痛得幾乎再也不能動了。</p>
<p>後來我的妹妹來呌我吃夜飯去了，我乘了這個機會，便走了出來，臨走的時候，還聽得阿六哥說「口那娘！今晚不打死你不是人。」他們還有許多更難聽的話，我也無心去聽了。</p>
<p>明天我又走到阿六哥家裏去看看，他們正在嘻嘻哈哈的吃點心，把昨天的事，完全忘掉了，他們看我來了硬要我吃點心，我看阿六哥頭上的傷痕，是多麽厲害呀！而我自已的手腕，也在隱隱作痛。</p>
<p>最後一想，夫妻相打，是用不到閒人勸的。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三十二回　聲色自娱將軍終日樂老少環泣戰士幾人回</p>
<p>桂枝到了糧食店門口，半側了身子，掩藏在一根直柱下等着。果然的，那對面土庫墻，高大紅門樓之下，停了一輛銀灰色的轎車。一個掛了盒子砲的大兵，開了車門，站在一邊候着，過了一會，一個穿灰鼠大衣的女人，同了一個穿西服的男子走了出來。桂枝看到了男子之後，不但不敢正眼兒瞧他，便是要看的那位姨太太，也不敢看，掉轉身子，就向屋子裏面走去。原來他所看到的那個男子，就是前日在路上遇到，向自已發笑的那個漢子，那天羞得面紅心跳，已經害怕了半天不料現在倒變成了鄰居，而且又讓他看到了并他是個有勢力的師長，這不是自已來找麻煩嗎？以後可不要胡亂站在大門口讓他看見了。他這樣急急的閃躱，總以爲可以避免麻煩的。但是那位全師長的眼光，不會比他更遲鈍，也就將他看到了，覺得他頭髮烏光光的，臉上白凈凈的，不借着脂粉的力量，那種天然美，比摩登婦女，還要好看。只是很快的一瞥，見他腹部的衣服，有些高高拱起，莫不是他是個婦人，已經有了丈夫了。好在他由那糧食店裏出來，和那糧食店裏總有些關係。對門對户，不怕打聽不出來，他心裏也橫下了這樣一個思樣，到了下午回得家來，就呌馬弁去打聽，怎麽對面糧食店裏，有年輕婦女出入，馬弁一聽了他的話因，就知道他命意所在。不到一小時，就回來報吿，說那不是糧食店裏的人，是他門新搬來的院鄰，兩老口子，帶了一個姑娘，另外還有個男用人，聽說那老頭子是作生意的，這位全師長聽說如此，作生意買賣的人，只要有錢可貪，沒有什麽事辦不到。尤其是老太太們，事情更好辦了。（四四○）</p>
<h3>外灘公園</h3>
<p>— 玉虹</p>
<p>火一般的太陽已經歛收着炎威，而漸漸的西隱了，一陣陣的晚風，蕩漾着充滿溽暑的市廛，在炎威壓迫下的人們，也好像久旱逢甘雨般的，漸漸的醒了過來！</p>
<p>許多的人，沿着江干，而向「華人與狗不准入内」的公園進行着，徼倖的華人，目前總算才脫離了狗籍，而离受着人類，的公平待遇了？</p>
<p>沿着江干，放着許多靠背的矮椅，人們像荐頭店裹的老媽似的，一行一行的靜坐着，懸掛在半空中的大月亮，隔着江水而照耀着，每一個充滿疲容的臉，潮水像狂風般的的蕩漾着，推送着一個個的漁舟，而隔斷了晚唱。</p>
<p>在樹陰花叢中，有卿卿我我的情話，有嘻嘻吃吃的嬌笑，有如怨如慕的低訴，同時也有些在流蕩著，他們多是爲了追逐異性而奔忙的。</p>
<h3>民食爲天</h3>

<p>東西梁山</p>
<p>梁山突兀東西峙，絶望臨流似削成，要塞昔憑天塹險，雄區久被霸王爭，投鞭未必能飛渡，橫槊徒然困甲兵。子弟八千何處去？江嘲嗚咽不成聲。</p>
<p>小常識</p>
<h3>吃茶的利弊</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>我們平常所吃的茶，大别爲紅綠茶兩種，然而無論那一種茶葉，都含有茶素，鞣酸，丹銀Ｔａｎｎｉｎ，蛋白質，咖啡因（Ｃａｆｆｉｎｅ）愛克司分等原素，茶味的厚薄濃淡，香辛苦澀，就是在含有成分的多少而異的。其中在學術上，成爲重大問題的，爲咖啡因與丹銀二種原素，咖啡因一入於水，立即浸出，丹銀公解力遲緩，譬如用開水一冲，咖啡因就會泡出丹銀要經過開水幾次泡過，才能浸出的。所以第一次所泡的茶，味道必定芳香，因爲有揮發性芳香成分的咖啡因，爲開水一冲，全部泡出來了。咖啡因富於興奮作用，爲白色針狀的結晶體，略帶苦味，對於腦神經心臓及腎臓，最容易受刺激，所以精神疲倦時，吃一杯茶，能够使精神奮發，然而飲得過多，反而要增加疲倦。除此以外，又具有促進消化循環血液，擴張腎臓血管利尿等功用，丹銀爲無色塊狀帶有澀味的東西，有引出胃腸粘膜之力，大凡上等名茶，含有咖啡因的量很多，龍井香片武彜普洱紅梅等茶葉的香味較好者，就是在此。可是我們的胃壁；受了大量的咖啡因刺激吸收，漸漸要患慢性的胃加答爾，頭腦與心臓，常受其興奮，要變爲腦神經過敏與心臓衰弱症的。不過茶與酒的性質相同，每天吃了一二杯茶，不能安眠的人，與天天吃幾十杯酒安適無事的人，那皆因習慣性養成的。我國的茶葉種類很多，且因製造法而異其形與色，紅茶係醱酵茶葉變爲紅褐色，磗茶把茶葉壓成塊形，其他所謂雀舌，圓豆，眉月等名茶，不遑枚舉，到本埠洋裝茶業公會去一看，名稱的繁多，形狀的複雜，不下百餘種。然而無論什麽樣變形異名，其茶素咖啡因的含有量，仍舊不變的。我國人有一種奇惡的習尙，都會鄉村，皆有茶樓茗店，而且終日啜飲，樂而妄倦，但我國人的吃茶，除了特殊的茶客外，大槪都以茶有香味爲主目的，反之，西洋人酷愛强烈濃厚的香味，這是國民性的嗜好習慣不同的所致啊。</p>
<p>咖啡可可與茶相同，都含有咖啡因，咖啡因出產地而異其種類，其與茶不同的成分如下，綠茶紅茶的有效成分爲二·○，咖啡爲○，作至一·五，可可爲一·五，又有脂肪五○，就是咖啡所含的咖啡因，比紅綠茶爲少，但因咖啡加糖與經過猛火的煮沸，其泡出的液比茶爲濃厚咖啡因的含有量亦很多，所以西洋人吃咖啡與可可而患胃病，與我國人吃茶相同，又與吃酒的人受刺激一樣的。因爲酒中的亞爾可爾，與茶咖啡可可的咖啡因的作用相同，吃高粱一兩，與吃紹興酒半斤，啤酒一瓶，其作用的强烈，當然以一杯高粱爲最厲害。爲什麽呢？三者在胃袋内吸收的亞爾可爾的分量，雖然差不多，但是到胃袋内的濃度，就大異了。空腹時候，吃了一兩燒酒，有百分之十至十五的亞爾可爾，紹興酒啤酒，以水量爲多，不過含有百分之四五，因其質量的濃淡，胃受刺激，遂有重輕了，所以不吃酒，愛吃茶的人，其受刺激，完全相同的，吃濃茶一杯，可抵吃紹酒一斤的分量。我生平與麴葉有不解緣，但最惡吃茶，因爲我的胃壁，受亞爾可爾的刺激，已成習慣，倘若吃了一杯濃茶，受不了强烈的咖啡因刺激，就要引起胃病來了。</p>
<p>「華人與狗不准入内」的公園，今日竟能充滿華人的聲調，在歸稫中的我，是在暗暗的自慶，但橫斷江流的異國兵艦，仍刁斗相望的在我目前炫耀着，暗暗自慶的我，又不禁泫然了！</p>

<p>糧食標粉麥多頭出籠</p>
<h3>麵粉</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈先漲繼跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回好三四五角左右、坎拿大好一二角、故開價後、七八九月份又見猛跳、較前週收價、計好二三分左右、十月份以下、則市氣平平、惟自二盤後、因有一部分之内地帶、以各處已得甘霖、人心見寛、獲利多頭、紛紛回出、數量甚巨、福早兩廠、亦因連日收進巨額小麥、對遠期各月份亦抛售甚暢（又傳洋麥已接近、廠家將定、惟阿麥定價實在須五元二角半、）故在三四盤之間、人心曾見大虚、七八九月較初開回跌三四分之巨、後則業外多頭、又復暢買、廠抛則已見寂、致市面又復回上、查業外終因洋麥之未能合劃、一意投機、且以實銷之略動、投機心思、愈轉濃厚、後步變化、將愈不可測也、結果本月份終較小釐半、八月好二厘半九月份好半分、十月份小二厘半、十一月份小分、十二月份小一分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>小麥</h3>
<p>昨日期去市面、上午開盤後、各月份呈先漲後跌之象、以洋麥報價、荥加哥坎拿大兩處、回好一二角至四五角不等、兼以北銷活動後、人心老住、當本月份開價、較前週竟猛漲一角、遠期各月份亦帶好幾分、旋以本月份多頭回出、且有實貨套售、致市面又忽一蹶不振、較最高時、回落九分之巨、遠期亦因多頭脫手、回落頗速、照旱區已得甘霖、米價亦不致過昻而言、從步恐須暫呈定局也、結果本月份祇好一分、八九月份小三分、十十一月份小四分、十二月份小六分、現麥市面、價呈平定行家之貨、直接配廠居多、客貨無甚上落、開明光麥三元三角七八分、無錫寳應麥三元三角半、蔣家壩麥三元三角七分蕪湖麥三元另九分、次七分、汪陰麥三元三角三分、次三角、高郵麥三元三角半、次三角三分、由福新去五千包、信大去一千包云、</p>

<p>（滬北）昨日河下各地來源二十八九號、市上各貨去胃呆滯、市形高白粳疲勢、中次價小二三角、薄稻鮮艷者挺立、中次小一角左右、早稻亦小三角、羊尖小尺許、餘貨亦見疲勞、</p>
<h3>訂講洋米使洋客秈交易觀望</h3>

<h3>做文章</h3>
<p>— 朔爾</p>
<p>沈括的「夢溪筆談」裏，有云：「往歲士人，多尙對偶爲文，穆修張景輩始爲平文，當時謂之「古文」。穆張嘗同造朝，待旦於東華門外，方論文次，適見有奔馬，踐死一犬，二人各記其事以較工拙。穆修曰：「馬逸，有黃犬，遇蹄而斃。」張景曰：「有犬，死奔馬之下。」時文體新變，二人之語皆拙澀，當時已謂之工，傳之至今。」</p>
<p>駢文後起，唐虞三代是不駢的，稱「平文」爲「古文」，便是這意思。由此推開去，如果古者言文眞是不分，則稱「白話文」爲「古文」，似乎也無所不可，但和林語堂先生的指爲「白話的文言」的意思又不同。兩人的大作，不但拙澀，主旨先就不一，穆說的是馬踏死了犬，張說的是犬給馬踏死了，究竟是着重在馬，還是在犬呢？較明白穩當的還是沈括的毫不經意的文章：「有奔馬，踐死一犬。」</p>
<p>因爲要推倒舊東西，就要着力，太着力，就要「做」，太「做」，便不但「生澀」，有時簡直是「格格不吐」了，比早經古人「做」得圓熟了的舊東西還要壞。而字數論旨，都有些限制的「花邊文學」之類，尤其容易生這生澀病。</p>
<p>太做不行，但不做，却又不行，用一段大樹和四枝小樹做一隻凳，在現在，未免太毛糙，總得鑤光牠一下才好。但如全體彫花，中間鏤空，却又坐不來，也不成其爲凳子了。高先生說，大衆語是毛胚，加了工的是文學，我想，這該是很中肯的指示罷。</p>

<h3>桐城派祖師作文不通</h3>
<p>— 敦龐</p>
<p>淸代文壇掌故雜錄之二</p>
<p>盛暑無俚，從曹聚仁先生處借得「淸朝野史大觀」翻閱，中有文壇掌故數則，與現在的文人故事相參看，頗有興味，因仿近人談明人小品法，轉錄一通，略加按語，以公同好。（以上應刋「雜錄之一」前，茲補登）。</p>
<p>方望溪侍郎以古文自命，意不可一世，惟臨川李穆堂輕之。望溪嘗　所作「曾祖墓銘」示穆堂纔閱一行即還之。望溪恚甚，曰：「某文竟不足一寓目乎？」曰：「然。」望溪益恚，請其說。穆堂曰：「今縣以桐名者有五：桐鄉，桐廬，桐柏，桐梓，不獨桐城也。省桐城而曰桐，後世誰知爲桐城者？此之不講，何以言文！」望溪默然者久之，然卒不肯改，其護過如此。金壇王若霖嘗言：「靈皐以古文爲時文，以時文爲古文」，論者以爲深中望溪之病。｜｜見竹汀先生潛研堂集。竹汀殆亦不滿於桐城者乎？</p>
<p>按：最近的文白論爭中，曾有過一個「此生與彼生」的問題，誰知桐城派的祖師方苞，老早就同樣地因爲「吾桐」而碰過壁，「此之下講，何以言文！」實在駡得痛快！今日的「文言復興」運動的提倡者，目前只能做梁啟超式的文言文，但倘有進步，必將復歸於桐城派。桐城派。桐城派的文章，其實就是八股文，即所謂「以時文爲古文」，八股文只能發揮空空洞洞的意思，用到叙述實際的事物時，就不能通。方苞論歸有光的文章道：「其辭號雅潔，仍有近俚而傷於繁者」，「俚」和「繁」是桐城派所最忌，而今日的白話文，却一味向「俚」和「繁」發展，將來發展到所謂「大衆語」，更將不堪。所以今之「文言復興」大師，也力主把「這個學生和那個學生」改爲「此生與彼生與彼生」。「雅潔」是「雅潔」了，無如不通何！</p>

<h3>一個旅行的故事</h3>
<p>— 宜閑譯</p>
<p>這篇寓言，原文載在倫敦「經濟學者」週刋，諷刺着現今流行於世界各國的經濟的國家主義，作者用幽默而深刻的筆調使關於經濟知識的文字趣味化，通俗化，的確是聰明的辦法。我覺得這種漫畫式的文體是値得提倡的。譯者記。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>蒙楚霍生男爵在酒店裏和幾個朋友喝着酒。第一杯酒下了肚，他重斟了一杯，便講他在奥太克斯坦（註一）旅行的故事：</p>
<p>「諸位朋友，我動身到奥大克斯坦去之前，經過了許多星期，方纔找到一個船主肯陪着我同去。我心裏早就熱辣辣地想到這個島上去，可是在先一直得不到去遊歷的機會。這是在大海洋的當中，要去原也容易。可是旅行家到過這地方的却非常少；因爲凡有外國船一開近那邊的口岸，就要受他們攻擊的。</p>
<p>「在幾十年前，奥大克斯坦本是世界强大的商業國。那邊每年有大量的財貨流進去，流出來。全世界各地方，見得到奥太克斯坦的船隻和貨物，在奥太克斯坦國内呢，各國的貨物也有着現成的市塲。後來世界大戰發生，使舊時的國際經濟制度陷於混亂狀態了。奥太克斯坦國内起了國家主義的運動，有一個動人的口號就是「奥太克斯坦國爲着奥太克斯坦人」。這運動馬上聲勢大盛，終於得到了完全的統制權，將全國的經濟政策改變了一下。外貨的進口禁止子，違犯的人還有着死罪。從那天起奥太克斯坦就完全靠着本國的富源立國了。諸位朋友，這番話只算是個引子，現在我要對你們講我在這個希奇的國度裏所見到的情形了。</p>
<p>「我們一路平安，到了奥太克斯坦的岸邊。在動身後的第四天，我們看見陸地了。太陽剛纔上升，曙光照在巨大的城牆上，這是圍遶着整個的島的。然而這城牆却還不是我的眼光所觸到的最可注意的東西。印象遠比這個深刻的是從牆後矗向天空的無數的工廠的烟囱，烟囱上寫着大字的標語，Ｔａｎｕ｜ｂｏｈｕ譯出來就是「買本國貨」的意思。</p>
<p>「然而我却沒有在沿岸仔細視察一悉的機會，因爲一隻小船已經向我們的船駛過來，問我們到奥太克斯坦來有什麽事情。費了許多口舌一我纔得到了上岸的　特别許可。然而我却只可以停留一天，而且附帶一個條件，我得嚴格遵守那個國度裏的一切習慣和法律。可是我還希望到了晚上，設法延長我的停留期間，我便興高彩烈地離船了。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>「我們的舢板急急地划過港灣去，這港灣顯然只是當作舢板的椗泊所的，那邊沒有鬧盈盈的氣象。當中豎着一座大石像。這是站在圓環裏的一個人，看去很像那舊世界的典型，證劵經紀人。陪伴着我的見我不在這前面行什麽敬禮，不由地驚惶起來，他們解釋着說這是聖彭克勒普休斯（註二）是這個島的守護神。他們吿訴我說，他是繁榮之神，是奥太克斯坦人的宗敎的中心。</p>
<p>「這宗敎的最神聖的滅律規定着物價得高到儘可能的程度｜｜那理想是一切物價逹到誰也付不出這麽高｜｜而工資呢，保持在最低可能的水凖。這是發展國家經濟利益的最好的辦法。如果物價騰高的結果軀商品的存貨累積起來，那麽就將這些商品獻祭於聖彭克勒普休斯了，不是焚燒在他的跟前，便是抛擲到石像周圍的海裏去。巴西，加拿大，阿根廷，美國，）（註三）而且爲着要使港灣裏免得淤灘逐漸增加起來，還裝置着很有效率的挖泥機器，將獻祭的商品一直帶到外海去。天天可以有幾千噸最優良的出品獻祭於守護神，這是全國覺得驕傲的事情。</p>
<p>「當我還在船上的時候，奥大克斯垣的官員們的古怪的模樣就使我呆了一下。雖然天氣很冷，他們的衣服却是紙做的，而且那紙還是破</p>
<p>爛的紙。當我近岸的時候，一見個個人都穿的是這種紙衣服，我便愈加吃驚了。</p>
<p>�後來那理由給我發見了。奥太克斯坦是餘了棉花以外，沒有什麽織維原料的，因了一九三三年的一種發明這棉花便不用作人類的衣服，却用作造路的原料了。（美國）他們吿訴我，在奥太克斯坦一切道路的表面下都有着兩英尺厚的棉花層，使旅行上更見得優良。我心裏想這太荒唐了。然而我是答應過尊重着這國家的習慣的，只得默着不作聲。總之，這種寄怪的實用已經使棉花的價格抬得非常高，只有幾個頂富的居民纔穿得起棉衣了。</p>
<p>其次惹起我的注意的是震天價　的牛的哀號聲。官員中間頂和的幾個見到我的張皇的神情便觸釋着說，天天有這許多牛趕到改造塲（Ｄｅｓｌｒｕｃｔｏｒ），去在那邊不多幾分鐘就變成膠了。他們吿訴我每個月裏總有五萬頭光景的壯健的生造成了膠，有的甚至還是小牛。（荷蘭和丹麥）「要這許多膠做付麽用呢？」我問。「問得怪呀！你難道不知道這個島的周圍、一英里之内流着一層厚厚的膠，免得有什麽外國人到城牆邊爬過來麽？」</p>
<p>「我不一會就發見了在這驚人的「防禦物」中間，只留着幾碼闊的一道狹口，我們終究是從這道狹口進去的。如果一個什麽外國人打算闖進旁的什麽地方去，他就不免黏在那膠上，苦苦地餓死，好像蒼蠅紙上的蒼蠅一般了。事實上，從奥太克斯坦開國以來，還不曾這樣地捉住過什麽人呢。然而國土的保衛，他們却看作非常重要的事情，居民是情願每個月犧牲五萬頭牛的。</p>
<p>「我們已經到了岸上了。因爲奥太克斯坦沒有國　外貿易，我在本國是得不到奥太克斯坦的貨幣的。我立刻走到銀行去兌換幾張鈔票。一這些小小的花綠紙是什麽？」當櫃的追問了。「這不是花綠紙」，我回答，「這是鈔票，有價値的鈔票，照票面可以兌換十足的金子的。」</p>
<p>「然而我的解釋，他聽了却莫明其妙。奥太克斯坦人不再需要像他從先代的故事上所聽到的這種貨幣了。貨物是互相交換的。他通知我，如果我要什麽東西！我得用我的戒指或是時錶去買；同時他和氣地警吿我還得很當心，不要使警察看見我這麽辦，因爲我運外國貨進口，也許要被他們判處死刑的。我謝謝他，便走了。</p>
<p>「當我從銀行出來的時候，一股香烘烘的煮着的新鮮咖啡的氣味衝進我的鼻管來，我忽然覺得肚裏發嘈了。時候已經十一點多了，我起先急怱怱離船，在船上錯過了一頓早飯。因此我問就近的警察，頂好的喝咖啡的地方在那里。「喝咖啡？」他跟着我說了一聲，便對我看了一眼，彷彿以爲我發呆似的。「咖啡是喝不來的。這是飼豬的頂好的食料，可是，自然呵，做煤氣的烯料，這也用得。（巴西）但是喝着呢｜那不行。奥太克斯坦沒有喝咖啡的。就是要喝，你怎麽喝得？這不是什麽液體。」我覺得來辯論這問題是沒有什麽意思的，便只問了一下、這新鮮的咖啡氣味從什麽地方出來。他指着我早就注意到的那些巨大的烟囱·說·這是從奥太克斯坦的國家復興工業的工廠裏出來的。他們在那里老是我求着利用本國的出產的什麽新方法。這會子，他們燒着咖啡，原來是要增加大「暖氣房」裏的熱度，他們這幾月來在那里培植着熱帶的菓樹哩。這使我忍耐不住了。「但是這一定是非常糜費的」，我說。「這些菓樹你們爲什麽不向有田野種着的那些國度去買，用你們現在用着燒「暖氣房」的咖啡去交換呢？那就一定便宜得多了。」他一聲不響，站在那里怔了一會。於是他直截地吩咐我跟在他的後面走。一到就近的警察所，我明白了，我原來違犯了奥太克斯坦的瀆神的法律，該受死刑了。然而因爲我是這許多年來第一個到那國遊歷的人，人情總算勝過法律了。話雖如此，要再逗留在這個島上可也談不到了。我的船在一個鐘頭之内就得離開，否則我就免不得要犧牲在膠的地帶裏了。</p>
<p>「我向港灣走去。在路上注意到房屋外面的人們站着喝杯子裏的東西，每啜一口，就在那房屋的墻壁上接一個吻。我想這該是一種什麽禮節罷，但要明白就裏，我却向一個陌生人問了一聲。他吿訴我，依一九三三年的發明，水門汀裏加了糖就發硬，現在是糖的產額的大部分放在造屋用的水門汀裏了。（美國）這個辦法使糖的需要大大地增加起來，已經把價格抬到可喜的高度，貴得窮人買勿起，只得在墻上舔着甜甜嘴巴了。</p>
<p>「我幸喜趕緊離開了，因爲奥太克斯坦的這種瘋狂的光景不住地激擾着我的神經哩。」</p>
<p>蒙楚霍生舉起杯子來，喝了一大口，還要講下去，那時他的朋友們止住了他，說是從來沒有聽過他扯這樣荒唐的大謊，請他還是講幾句眞話罷。蒙楚霍生苦笑了。「你們以爲我吿訴你們奥大克斯坦的生活是扯大謊麽？有的時候，我講故事也許會粉飾幾分的罷。但是諸位朋友，請相信我，至少今天我說的全是眞話，你們竟不相信我麽？」說着，蒙楚霍生站起身來，嗒喪着臉走出酒店了。</p>
<p>（註一）奥太克斯坦（Ａｕｉａｒｋｉｓｔａｎ）是從Ａｕｔａｒｃｈｙ（獨裁，絶對權）這個字引申出出來的。</p>
<p>（註二）彭克勒普休斯（Ｂａｎｋｒｕｐｔｉｕｓ）是從Ｂａｎｋｒｕｐｔ（破產）這個字引申出來的。</p>

<h3>自然的反抗兒</h3>
<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>從上古的「茹毛飲血」，穴居野處」而進到現階段，「山珍海味」，「歐美大菜」，「高樓大厦」，「水汀冷氣」······更有那火車，輪船，郵電，飛機······把自然中的大地縮短了至幾千幾萬倍。所以，人類實是「自然的反抗兒」（郎開士特Ｌａ要ｎｋｅｓｔｅｒ的話），用着種種科學發明的「巧奪天功」底工具，得來改變自然，利用自然，甚至征服了自然。這樣，是創下了我們這個偉大的人類進化史；而我們這個最偉大的功績，就是科學，也就是我們「自然的反抗兒」底雙手的勞動！</p>
<p>就像這次亢旱酷熱的「天災」吧，受到的是有很多不同的國家。而救旱求雨的方法，也就有着種種的不同：像東鄰的日本帝國主義，就本着牠的「尙武精神」，軍隊們用了日常的「吃飯傢伙」大砲，來向天開着，爲福岡，廣島，小倉，熊本等地的農民「祈雨」。本來，爲了要避去風暴的水災，聽說是能用砲轟天，使烏雲分散而不能再凝雨下降，這個是還算合理而科學化些，然而要「求雨」，也可開砲轟天，這樣雖是能够使空氣振盪，但是將怎樣得使空中的水蒸凝結成液汁呢？這實在是疑問，亦可說是奇聞了。</p>
<p>另外一個與日本恰反相的國家蘇聨，却是在那裏「人工造雨試騐成功」了。方法說是以電放射到空中，這樣，水蒸是遇到了「電子」而凝結起來，「人工」的雨下降了！雖然說是這個方法太不經濟，但是這豈不是人類的與自然抗爭而得征服了自然的成功嗎？</p>
<p>至於我們中國吧！各地亢旱酷熱的消息旣多，情形更詳。除了江浙兩省外，更有皖，豫，鄂，贛，冀，魯，陜等省都受旱災。所有報載消息有「亢旱酷熱，農田龜裂，災象已成；各地吿急電文，如雪片飛來······」。可是我們的救旱方法呢？眞多！除了那般勞苦愚民們的「靠天吃飯」而行首種種「祈雨」集會，與用抽水機，水龍機｜救火車｜來汲取水流外，最出色的要算本埠幾個著團所舉辦的「禱雨法會」，與班禪大師的在棲霞山，寳華山等地「設壇祈雨」，以及張天師淨壇發符的「祈雨消災會」等等。</p>
<p>然而，我實不得而知：在這「斷屠七日」中，許多的動物果然僥倖遲死幾天了，而一般正每天無救而受着貧，熱，病所壓迫死去了的各地的勞苦民衆（正是動物呢？），我們的「大慈善家」們也將怎樣的使他們在這七天中延遲一下子呢？這簡直是極大的疑問了。</p>
<p>本來，迷信｜宗敎｜的起源是在有人類對自然界的一切巨大的力量和現象，尋不出牠的因果法則，而起的恐怖心理：因此對於這此現象就有所尊崇敬畏，所以神的觀念，便由此發生而宗敎也就此形成了。可是今日是二十世紀的科學時代呢？那末，我們就得知道宗敎是爲社會的精神工具之一種，而我們的社會旣是有着牠多樣不同的階層，因此牠的變化與發展，當然是有着牠的社會背景的在這裏，我們是得承認寒白君在「科學破產了嗎？」中所說的「迷信是欺騙者們的精神工具······」了。</p>
<p>然而，人類是不能脫離了人爲環境｜社的，而獨自生存的，而這個環境是須隨着時代的進展而不斷地在向前，在進化的。這樣，在這環境中的「自然的反抗兒」，當然須不停地來改變我們自身以外的工具，與人爲環境了。而在一般違反了這個趨勢的人類，是終竟不能站足而要被歷史打下來的！</p>
<h3>夏天的早晨</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>在夏天，是很悶人的，陽光的威芒照耀着大地起了燃燒，自然，在房子裏，是更不會好過的。然而，假使是在早晨，那！像這種直接的賜與，是可以避免的，</p>
<p>熱，無論誰都怕的，在高貴的人們，怕的程度或者更爲厲害，雖然在他們的屋子裹，有着大的風扇和冷的設備，而勞動者呢？在享受上，當然不敢作這樣的妄想，但在苦楚上，却也有着不同的差異的。至少他們不像高貴者有那樣如此的設想的。</p>
<p>在早晨，如果你能起得早，到那黃浦的江邊，水，那麽黃，划子，很輕快的在鏡子似的水面上幌着，幌着，江濤，冲擊着岸邊，迸發着那悅人的恊調的音奏并還有，那在船上搬運着貨物的小工，那雄壯哼唉呐喊，這，力的表現呵！</p>
<h3>黑神</h3>

<p>再拐到郊野，那綠的樹叢，綠的草原，夾推着澄碧的河流，在輕薄的紗霧裏聽那夏蟲的啁啾，這些，會使你覺到自然間的柔美，恬靜和偉大。</p>
<p>如果在歸途上，能從小菜塲兜進了弄堂，獲得的是更要豐富了，擺的藝術，搶的藝術，以至於駡的藝術，在這裏，是可以飽飽地領略的。</p>
<p>弄堂，的確是洋洋大觀的，早上的輕風掃蕩着露睡的人們的臉，在適意的甜臥着，橫的，豎的，男的，女的·······雖不各色齊全，却色花樣俱備的。</p>
<p>像電似的，只需要短短地一瞥，那寳貴的早晨，就會過去的，然而這，高責的人們是不屑去享受，能享受的，還是那一羣不准有熱的設想的勞力者呵！</p>
<h3>鄉間</h3>
<p>— 澍白</p>
<p>從宅東的遠處傳來了幾種不同音的鑼鼓聲；在這一個一點都沒有聲息，單祇有幾隻蟬兒躱在樹上單調地唱着歌的村裏，聽見了這幾聲隱約的鑼鼓聲，都不免有些空泂和焦急的感覺。這是東西二村的户頭合併了幾個錢從遠處的鎭上請了幾名比較有點聲名的道士在那年被日本鬼子砲轟去的宅基上築起了丈來高的　　　　　　絶祈雨的第三天，也就是最後的一天。</p>
<p>今年也不知怎的老是不下雨，而太陽祗放射着炎熱；着了草鞋從那將要龜裂的路上走的話，那就簡直像有無數根的利刺鑽進心頭一樣的疼痛；而那白楊樹上掛流着的白漿，在太陽的照耀下發出炫眼的光芒。照理，現在正値黃霉節，應該多雨水的季節，然而現在不要說沒有雨水，就是連下雨的樣子也不曾有過。</p>
<p>人們都爲了這些而焦急着，他們差不多已是好幾晝夜的不曾休息，祗用盡了他們的力量想來挽回這危局。他們從早上就跨上水車，就是在深夜也可聽見「嘩啦，嘩啦」的踏水車聲，但是田裏看不見像有過水樣的。花田：（棉花）裏祇見花枝一天天的萎枯下去，稻田更不像個樣子，幾年前的荒年現象，現在又擺在每一個人的面前。</p>
<p>「大叔，明天還是不會下雨罷！你看我們的田裏都不是要涸乾死了嗎」？太陽正照在那年輕伙子的肐膊上發出一層油光，額上的汗像黃荳般大直向臉上淌着，兩隻脚像沒有氣力的機械般的踏着水車。</p>
<p>「現代世界是變了，連替薩也不靈！說不定人作孽太多，不然天老爺眼睛總生的」。在那憔悴的面部上現出一團的憂鬰。</p>
<p>「大叔，這次每户出五毛錢請道士唸經也是可以省下來的，你看鬼混了三天連一點雨也不見，他們一班鬼子祇會騙錢。」</p>
<p>「唉，總之世界是一天不如一天！」</p>
<p>「大叔，二個妹妹不是在上海紗廠裏做工，一個月有二十幾塊錢嗎？」</p>
<p>「唉，不要說起，這二個月連一個小錢也沒寄回來，聽說她們在鬧什麽罷工。」</p>
<p>「·····················」</p>
<p>「唉·········」像有一句話說不出來似的，把頭搖了搖。</p>
<p>太陽已慢慢的西沉，宅東的鑼鼓聲又凑進了幾聲。</p>
<h3>人生獨白</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>人生倒底怎麽一回事？吾可不知道。但是，人旣經生了，爲什麽又要死的呢！那正是一個啞謎：吾相信這個啞謎，卽是在永久的將來也不會有人來解釋明白的。</p>
<p>人生究竟是怎樣的；人生有什麽意義？人生是不是矛盾的？吾這樣的懷疑着。</p>
<p>吾，最近以來的思想，愈趨頽唐了；時常發出各種令人不可解答的奇想，和不可捉摸的疑問。有時，風狂般的縱放，有時却沉默着不發一言。所以，有好多些人，都疑惑吾害了神經病的，但，吾亦不否認。好吧，就是神經病也好，反正做人是做夢，今天不知明天的；何必一定要去追根究底，自尋苦惱！</p>
<p>本來，吾自已承認是一個悲觀主義派，因吾是悲觀主義派，所以對於世界上一切的一切，都覺得是靈空的，悲哀的。</p>
<p>現在，吾沒有錢可以揮霍，又沒有閒可以享樂；只爲着生活的鞭策，終日祗在那茫茫的人海裏奔波！不迭地奔波！這情形，眞好像一匹馬的奔馳，一隻牛的耕犁，和一葉扁舟的飄流，飄流，但不知飄流到何時方休！</p>
<p>因爲吾太重視了人生觀，所以天文只在悲愁的氛圍裏討生活，雖然吾自已也明白，悲哀過度了是要傷身體的；但是吾的一切，已給命運支配定了，因此，吾現實所擺在面前的，都是失望！灰心！和悲哀！</p>
<p>生活，經濟，只不住地在吾這糢糊的腦海裏盤旋日悲哀！煩惱自更不時的向吾這微弱的心靈上襲擊！吾所受的刺激實在太深了；啊！這樣的人生！</p>
<p>吾沒有粉紅色的夢，也沒有美妙的回憶，僅僅有一個醜惡的殘夢而已！現在，吾的唯一追求對象就是金錢，自然，吾除了金錢和女人之外，什麽也不愛的了。吾當然瞭解得，有了錢，什麽事都可辦，都可幹。同時，吾也認識愛情；本來，靑年人是少不了這個的。而且，吾覺得現實的生活，太單調了，太苦悶了。於是，便想去追求一個理想中異性來，調劑調劑現實的生活。</p>
<p>吾相信，愛情是無條件的，無代價的；但是，事實却這末吿訴吾說：愛情也少不了錢，要是沒有錢去談變愛是不行的。像吾這樣的一個窮措大，那裏來的錢？因爲沒有錢，所以吾始終還是一個孤獨者。</p>
<p>時常，吾這麽想；女人和金錢，牠們在世界上，都是最鄙卑而可惡的，人間世多多少少凑楚的慘劇，都是爲牠們而發生的。可是，牠們也有被賓貴而可愛的時候，世界上有許許多多美滿的喜劇，也都是牠們所造成的。假使沒有了牠們；那末，世界上就决不會發生無聊的糾紛和無謂的鬥爭了，那時候，才能够眞的實現一個偉大的大同，世界。不過，人們却又要感到人生的沒有意味了。呵！矛盾的人生，矛盾到什麽時期才能够不矛盾呢？吾始終不能明白，人生倒底是怎麽一回事？是夢嗎？不｜决不是夢；那末是什麽呢？想吾不能回答。</p>
<p>事實很明顯的吿訴吾：儘管幻想，和光是悲哀是沒有用的　痛惡人生和咒詛社會，更有什麽用呢？環境是人造的，社會是空洞的，最後的勝利，和偉大的成功，還是要靠自已去健實的奮鬥！只有奮鬥！才是吾們靑年的成功捷徑。吾們應該從困苦的荆棘叢中去找尋一條光明的出路；去創造一個新的生命才是。</p>

<p>挽狂瀾於旣倒，始於今年，辟邪說於方張，盛行南國，倡文言復古於前，提男女關防於後，行見文縐縐酸溜溜雍容揖讓之風，或將復盛於我國，豈不懿歟盛哉。但文言復古，究爲避重就輕之談，禁泳禁行，亦屬捨本逐未之法，正本淸源，其維賴乎禁止男女同床乎。何者，男女同床，誰能止乎禮義，夫婦共枕，豈得敬如賓朋，床第之間，旣不免有倒鳳顚鸞之舉，則社會之内，自應多黃童白叟之徒，隔牆或有曠夫，窗外豈無怨女，於是逾牆而摟處子，夜奔而就車夫，傷風敗俗，豈有甚於此者乎并且同行究有衣服之隔，同泳亦僅限於一方，惟有同床，最傷風化，流弊所極，恐伊於胡底也，或曰，夫婦是五倫之一，敦倫乃周公之禮。然則，男女旣可得假夫婦之義而同床，豈不能藉朋友之名而同行，且「有女同車，有女同行」旣目爲鄭衛淫奔之什，則「琴瑟友之，鏡鼓樂之」安得爲同南必正之篇，況養精蓄銳，不妨從事於他途，而减育節生，可致力救國工作，卽使絶民族於將來，究能正人心於此刻。竊疑明禁所施，胡乃嚴於末而寛於本耶。謹効芻蕘之貢，聊爲管蠡之陳，伏祈邦人君子，採擇施行，則黨國幸甚，人民幸甚，</p>
<h3>寂寞之夜</h3>
<p>— 炯女士</p>
<p>爲着了自已想獲得生活的獨立起見，終於很屈强的離開了溫和的，可愛的家園，無可奈何的跑到這陌生的路上來。艱難的，困苦的和這陌生道上的惡魔搏戰啊！</p>
<p>到夜來，火一般熱的氣溫，漸漸隨</p>
<p>着陽光而消逝，舒適的，凉爽的空氣，也就隨着每一個人的心的要求降下，微風波浪的吹來，夏蟬不復再在樹梢發出那末不斷的交鳴，彷彿一切都在靜寂的空氣包圍中，暫時停止了活動。</p>
<p>樹葉摩擦出一陣沙沙的嚮聲，吹得溪裏的水起作一些小點的銀紋，月兒高高的掛在天空，反映在地上的銀輝，是那末的明亮而美得可愛啊！沿着校門走去，直穿到校園的後門，這末長長的一條跑道，盡都是人影；談着的，笑着的；甚至有的想出一些絶妙的避暑法，而將蚊帳高高的扯在楊柳的梢頭，將鐵床舖在樹下，灣灣的柳枝，從高到低的飄掦着，人們就給籠罩在裏面，發出些輕微的聲音，有的也高聲歌唱着。</p>
<p>「這終於對於陌生，寂寞的人，是一種莫可言諭的凄凉啊！」在心底深處，發出了這樣不可理解的感喏！</p>
<p>月兒分外的明亮，凉爽的氣溫，更加使人感到夜裏的可貴！從窗口打進來的風聲，呼呼的嚮亮起·對於這陌生的人是一種莫名的恐怖與害怕啊！懷着一顆思家的心，更感喟到自已踏上這陌生的路程的寂寞，要不是再三鼓着勇氣去奮鬥，是多末困難的事啊！</p>
<p>同室的伴侶，盡都睡得呼呼的，早已入了睡鄉，火車一輛一輛地從窗前不遠的地方駛過，我眼睜睜地望着火車頭上發出的那條火光，像巨蛇樣的怕人。自已就是這般彷忽迷離的，展轉的，毫不安定的感到在這寂寞的夜裏，自已是踏上了寂寞之路，而在這路上要去尋求人生的滋味？</p>

<h3>她們的隊伍</h3>
<p>小說</p>
<h3>歸來（三）</h3>
<p>— 保加利亞伊凡·瓦卓夫作楊森譯</p>
<p>六天後，一個押送塞拉比亞囚徒的志願兵，他的兒子的朋友，給她帶來了一封信。這信是斯託揚寫的。她急忙將信拿到僧正那里，要他讀給她聽。信裏是這樣寫着：</p>
<p>「我正在寫這封信吿訴你我還活着，而且很好，而且打敗了塞爾比亞人。保加利亞萬歲！我很好，朗魁爾，斯託印諾夫也很好，我們的表弟狄米特留斯也好。他致意給他的母親。塞爾比亞。人用槍砲轟我們，可是他怕我們的喊聲！明天我們將經過德振戈曼的山路。當我們回來的時候，我要從尼施帶一件禮物給琪娜。我送回一佛朗供你零用。我將吿訴拉杜喬彈殻怎樣吹嚮。祝福你。　　你的孝敬的兒子</p>
<p>斯託揚，多布列夫</p>
<p>「特别致意爹爹彼德，我想送給他一支塞爾比亞的手槍，可是沒有人肯送。賽爾比亞人很遠地運了來，可是他們不會射擊。特别致意斯託揚加。」</p>
<p>這封信使存娜憂悉的心大大地快活了。她盡力跑到斯託揚加的父母的家裏，在那兒也是非常地歡喜。但是其中最歡喜的，要算拉杜喬了，他極想知道他哥哥敎給他吹哨的新方法。</p>
<p>存娜，走到街上來，又看見一羣囚徒，在囚徒後而也有一個保加利亞兵士押送着。阿，如果那就是斯託揚的話？她立刻走上前去。但那不是他。她想問一問那個兵士是否知道她的兒子的消息，但她的注意力是被那些囚徒吸引去了，因爲這是第一次她目睹囚徒。</p>
<p>「上帝呀！」她喃喃地說。「這些是塞爾比亞人麽？他們看來像是上等人。他們的母親想到他們跑到這麽遠來，是多麽不幸呀！等一會兒，孩子們！」</p>
<p>她急忙跑進家裏去，手裏拿着一杯白蘭地走回來，向塞爾比亞人呌着要他們等候，她是拿酒給他們喝的。那看守囚徒的保加利亞的兵士微笑了，停住了他的隊伍。</p>
<p>「謝謝，謝謝」那些恩的囚徒們說，他們飲了幾口酒身上暖起來了。</p>
<p>「還剩一點兒給我麽。祝你健康，老母親！」保加利亞兵士呌着，觀快地飲乾了杯中酒。</p>
<p>「他們也是上帝的孩子。和我們一樣地是基督敎徒。····」存娜媽媽想着，看見那小隊伍消失在遠方。</p>

<h3>新世界之建築（二）</h3>
<p>— Ｃｈｅｎｅｙ著沈一吾譯</p>
<p>各方面的思想都在支配着我人，我們的生活完全混合在舊新相和的動作與習慣中，我們現在正生在一種機器革命的時期，每個人的往來，賣買，作工，游玩，與一切的生活方式都是變成機器化，在白天裏寫字用自來水筆，活動鉛筆：晚上用手電燈走路，我洗手可在房間裏的滋盆自來水缸，下我出外可坐汽車，假使你以爲汽車太慢，那麽你可到大城市中去搭坐飛機，在美國，每一農人與工人幾乎都各有自動車，每一個小學生都有自來水筆和手電燈，而且沒有一幢房子裏會少了養病室，每一家的主婦沒有不用電爐來作烹飪，我們處今科學之世界中，所交接者無非是一些打字員電報員，無綫電員，我們日常引以爲娛樂者，就是唱機無綫電的播音與電影。我們幾乎已成了機器的施用者我們一切的生活都經改變，與先祖時代大不相同。</p>
<p>可是，事實是很悲觀，雖然我們於今已被稱爲機器的使用人，而倒有百分之九十九却還住在一種卑低文化的舊房子裏，這些房子裏毫無機器的踪跡，衛生室，自來水管缸，冰房不用談起，連門子還裝着舊式的框條，窗子還劃成舊式的小格，這是眞的，在這房子沉澱着古代歷史的遺臭，而他們居還自誇謂什麽英國式啦，西班牙式啦，在我們一切的生活上早已「維新」，而房子却還墨守舊法，一成不變的斤斤於彼等之Ｓｌｙｌｅ爲自榮，這眞是可憾啊！</p>
<p>有時我懷疑，爲什麽他們不去換一個新的科學的方式呢？使我們生活可以簡單，生動，而美化，｜｜但是我不願去盤問這般建築師們，</p>
<p>我有一次離開了這歷史陳跡的房子，到了另一個完備的新建築裏，這所新建築是一所簡單化的立體造成三層樓在辦公室與街巷之間有一條小弄，房子裏有機器梯的上下，有大廳，有廊屋，有用鋼骨和三和土造成的地板，用方磗與灰泥造成的牆壁，金屬的門和窗格，此外如衛生室，火爐，洗手缸，電燈之設備一應俱全，這種新建築幽閒爽暢，完全離去了所謂歌德式，希臘式諸過去的陳式，只有在電梯的橺門上加上了一些花紋的綫條，一切一切，都能使怡情悅性，因爲這完全是一個機器的方式，</p>
<h3>築路須築基</h3>
<p>— 洋洋</p>
<p>我們人類搆成一身之營養料，其運輸之工作在血脈；世界各國搆成其國家之營養料，其運輸之工作在道路。故血脈不暢，其人必爲病夫；道路不修，其國亦必爲病國，這是無所疑義的。孫總理之民生主義，認定建築道路，修治運河，以利民行，與衣食住三者有同等之需要。建國方略中，於建設鐵路實業河流諸計劃之外，規定在全國中應完成碎石路一百萬英里。其他散見於歷次演講，無不以建築道路，爲必要之圖謀。今者國難方殷，外侮日亟，正是我們生聚敎訓之時期。而建築道路一問題，實爲目前救國切要之工作，舉國上下，應該如何共同努力，以期大功吿成呢？不過建築道路，千頭萬緖，必非一二言語所能盡說。據建築專家說：治路頭緖雖多，其要素亦祗有二，一爲路之闊度，一爲建築築上之類别。之寛狹及類别，當然不能一一預先規定，要其大槪情形，却不難視各地方之經濟狀况，及面積距離，施以精密審核，以此測彼，大同小異，則一切措施大綱，自可迎刃而解了。</p>
<p>至於路之設計建築，其種類亦有二，就是「堅實」與「半堅實」之分。堅實之道路，大都用三合土鋪築，所費極鉅，在中國一般内地地方，恐尙難辦到。若按我國目下情形，社會行的需要而說，仍以築半堅實之道路，比較合宜。因爲所費旣無多，事半而功倍，又何樂不爲？然而亦有視各地趨勢而作區别的，並非謂處處皆必如此。譬如近十年來，廣東漢口南京天津各大都市，一部份皆有良好之「堅實」道路築成，尤以廣東爲最，眞不愧爲革命之發祥地啊！在廣東省城中，表面上民衆之行的問題，都算解决了吧？</p>
<p>「築路須築基」，這話似非自今日才有，好像在從前一切建設上，久已有此口號了。天下事不外一個「理」字，無論古今中外，又皆人同此心，心同此理，一筆寫不出兩個「理」字來。所以關於「築路須築基」之說，古今中外，莫不極其重視，历爲優劣成敗，皆屬於基礎。優劣成敗之分，自然是在取材精良，及工程認眞兩件事。而此兩件事之轉移，大槪以費用多寡爲原則，換言之，如果偷工减料，當然歸於劣敗，必不能恃久，這其中亦有不能盡歸咎承辦工程者，因爲根本上經濟卽不十分充足，事事均從勉强敷衍着手的。我於此忽想起了北平，牠是一座「古城」，牠是前淸的都會，所謂「輦蹕之下」的地方。牠那寛闊廣大之馬路，雖不能够造到「堅實」地步，也該負有「半堅實」的名稱，方是道理。却不料牠竟是「無風三尺土，有雨一街泥」。這固屬是一般詩人的輕薄和譏誚，但於象徵上形容，的確半點都不錯！</p>
<p>從今以後，我們建設道路，自然爲實現新中國的要舉，而不容遲緩的。不過對於築基一層，是應該特别注意！至少要築成「半堅實」之路。像那「三尺土」「一街泥」之路，築了等於未築，又何必勞民傷財呢？</p>

<h3>從「大衆語」方面再論粤語聲片（上）</h3>
<p>— 唐納</p>
<p>我在「每日電影」寫了一篇「粤語聲片與大衆語設」，結論是說：「無論從那方面看來，方言電影｜｜戲劇｜｜文學在大衆語建設問題的解决上，是有着决定的意義的」。可是丹楓先生在本刋「大衆語在電影中之運用「文中寫道，「在目前，我們極力反對廣東語對白的聲片之攝製」。</p>
<p>首先應該說明的，我并不曾把大衆的方言士語曲解爲大衆語。我以爲，方言士土語文學在大衆語建設過程上是有决定意義的。這話就是說，統一的國語，不是沒有一定的社會條件就可以造成的。它是高度發展了的方言的溶化，這方言的高度發展，是大衆生活的發展的結果。方言在發展中溶化，這就是國語統一的過稫；我這個意義上，國語是自然生長的；但因爲方言根本就是活的人的口頭語，這種口頭語的統一是一個集團創造的過程，我們把握住國語統一的過程，提高大衆生活并且提高方言的發展，在方言的溶化過程上加以整理的作用，乃是可能而且必要的，從這個意義看來，國語統一不能不是一個目的意識的運動。</p>
<p>丹楓先生要由電影的語言文字部份來帮助消滅方言土語統一個語，實際上是不認識，國語統一運動在現階段，主要的一個任務是方言土語的提高，而把電影當作仙丹，好像廣東大衆得它的帮助就可以學會國語似的。</p>
<p>我們看現在紳商買辦的「國語」，不是成了一種差不多沒有人講的外國語一般的東西了嗎？假如在廣東，多少年來的紳商買辦的「國語」統一運動有一些消滅方言土語的成效，粤語聲片决不會在製片家的課内佔一重要位置。</p>
<p>照丹楓先生的說法，現在在電影上提倡國語，可以帮助方言的消滅，可是結果，廣東觀衆不懂國語，怕不要像不懂英語而看英美聲片一樣的隔膜和難理解。（自然，英美人和華人的生活的差别較諸廣東人和他省人的生活的差别要大得多，因而不懂英語，將更難懂英美聲片。）</p>
<p>「大衆語，一定不是一元的國語式的東西，而是和各以當地的大衆爲對象的多元的發展」。（高荒：「由反對文言文到建設大衆語」），但和地大衆的生活是在發展中溶化，語言自然也在發展中溶化，所以我要說，「這個多元的發展，方向却是準對着一元的國語的。」</p>
<p>我們看上海人稱「我」爲「阿拉」，這是寗波話，但是因爲寗波人在上海社會生活中的比重之大，而成了上海的普通話，這不是誰提倡的結果，而是溶化的結果。</p>
<p>丹楓先生以爲我們假使「維持」方言土語，那末就等於分裂民族的統一。可是事實上，現在漢族的語言以至社會經濟，本來京是分裂的，這點丹楓先生也不會否認。民族的統一，不是從方言電影｜｜戲劇｜｜文學的提倡才開始被分裂的。而方言電影｜｜戲劇｜｜文學的提倡，恰正就是「爲統一的分裂。」</p>
<p>丹楓先生承認可以攝製純粹的蒙古或西藏苗民的影片，但是要使并不統一的方言土語由電影的帮助而統一，這是予盾的。爲什麽我們不能如丹楓先生這樣主張，由電影的帮助，以統一漢蒙藏苗的語言呢？不錯，漢蒙是種族的區别，廣東與河北，只是地域的區别，可是事實上南北語言的差殊，的確有如兩個種族。丹楓先生說「在自由獨立的民族健全發展上，應當使其語言完全一致，以構成統一的文化。」可是語言統一的過程，并沒有像丹楓先生所想像的那們單純。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「壽頭勿壽腦」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ｐａｌｏｏｋａ｜｜南京</p>
<p>假使以上次大上海開映的「黃金狂」相比較的話，我們决不承認這是如何成功的喜劇。而另一方面，我們也承認，這裏的胡閙部份，並不很多。因此我們認爲這一影片始終不過是較有成績的而已。</p>
<p>首先我們從内容的檢舉來說，這裏至少劇作者表示反對拳鬥者不能沉醉於糜爛的生活中，勝利的代價，决不是「冠軍」等榮譽的獲得，喬自一蹶不振之後，翻然醒司過來，這給與當前所流行的英雄的錦標運動，無論如何是一種比較積極的打擊。</p>
<p>但是劇作者並不是沒有錯誤觀念的，主要的是和「田野風月」或「時代的進展」等同樣，將農村和都市對立起來，以爲都市總是罪惡的，而農村却是樸質可風，這不能從經濟機構上去理解，到底是我們所應指斥的。</p>
<p>然而在這裏就喜劇的藝術價値上來重述幾句。不管是喜劇或者是悲劇，我們從形象上去觀察它而給與它成功與否的估價，無論如何是不能放棄内容而僅從形式上去批判。形式是内容的决定，這句話是我們相信的。因此，一個内容空虚的作品，無論是在文學上或者是電影上；决不能有其存在的眞價。而喜劇的電影藝術之一形式，也决不是淺薄胡閙所能完成的。藝術是藉形象而思維，假使僅僅是形式而不能給欣賞者有所思維的東西，那末在作品上已經失却它最重要的藝術成份子。換句話說，卽是要以成功的創作技巧去深刻的引起人們的同感，假使觀衆們雖然在影戲院裏大大的笑了一塲，而走出戲院便毫無所感的空無所有，那末這决不是藝術·而是無意識的胡調。</p>
<p>而軟性的紳士們却完全忽視了這種基本的要素，而只主張滑稽打諢，無理取閙。這一種說法，本來已經給人們打擊得體無完膚，不過在這裏我們却要愼重的說明：我們說這「壽頭勿壽腦」有少許成功，决不是如他們完全根據於滑稽打𧫤而决定，而是說劇作在這中間也多�</p>
<p>少給與了我們一些東西。至於過於稱讚了的說它是喜劇中無上的作品，那也是不應該的。</p>
<p>導演者能使用着純熟的喜劇手法，使作品在形式上成爲非常美麗，這無論如何是Ｂａｎｊｅｍｉｎ　Ｓｔｏｏｌｏｆｆ値得矜的。他將笑的部份大半放在對話方面，他對於每一相同的塲面，都不肯用相同時的手法，他對於拳鬥的塲面，不因其緊張刺戟，而每一次都直接描寫，而是有些地方只用音響表現，使一塲主要的拳鬥作爲唯一的高潮，這些地方，都表示他不是平庸的。而經濟的剪接，不過於浪費所謂偉大的塲面，也應當是他的優點</p>
<p>傑美杜倫的演技，眞是不敢十分稱讚的。程步高在靑年會電影講演會中所說的「誇張到不是，人的動作」，在傑美杜倫身上可以實用。雖然我們承認喜劇是要誇張的，可是過於過火，而至於失了眞實的感覺，那將是反而失了：他誇張的效果了。在喜劇上需要相當程度的誇張，使其成爲比眞實更眞實的表現，這是傭俗的演員們不會理解的。傑美杜倫在這裏如能做到不使人討厭的程度，那眞是萬幸了。</p>
<p>演得最好的是Ｓｔｕａｒｔ　Ｅｒｗｉｎ，其次羅范麗也還可以。其餘諸人都算稱職。觀衆意見</p>
<h3>評「爲誰犧牲」</h3>
<p>— 玉虹</p>
<p>這是一部義勇軍的抗日戰史，在這國難方殷，失地未復的今日，照照是很可引起一部分觀衆們注意的，但是爲了導演者手法的不够，和題裁的不正確，非但沒有緊張的劇情，而除了開幕與閉幕的兩個戰爭的「澆頭」外，簡直是一幅平而的畫圖，而沒有絲毫的激刺與高潮，較之去年的那一部同樣故事的「孤軍」，尤爲遜色。</p>
<p>不錯，在這層層環境的壓迫下，我們也很能了解作者的苦心，但作者旣標出了抗日的旗幟，最低限度也應在可能的範圍内，而予觀衆們以有力的激刺，不應迥避了偉大的現實，而專事描寫些義勇軍爲爭風吃醋而内鬨的無聊事蹟，這是我們覺得最可痛心的一點。</p>
<p>在劇情方面，有着不少的矛盾，尤其是那女間牒的自首，雖然作者以爲是戀愛至上主義的勝利，殊不知無形中確放過了本片的高潮，而消滅了全劇偉大的意義，至於後半部的剪接方面，更是非常的紊亂，如呂震出差歸來，綉華與宗漢來往等幾幕，時間與串插完全衝突而矛盾。</p>
<p>不過，也有一個差强人意的镜頭，就是文綺失戀後，在湖自傷的一幕，在這片内，是最美麗的一個畫而了。其餘的表情，佈景，與光綫，字幕等都不足論了。</p>

<h3>廿世紀快車（Ｔｗｅｎｔｉｅｔｈ　Ｃｅｎｔｕｒｙ）（五）</h3>
<p>— 文蔭</p>
<p>火車在黑夜中，拼命似地往前衝。無論遇到什麽···火燒，水淹，或是狂風大雪···二十世紀快車的到紐約從來沒有誤過點。火燒，水淹，狂風，大雪，那車守恨恨地說道，倒是和這次的旅客很相宜的，因爲在這趟車上，除了已經有了一位瘋狂的戲院經理，硬要呌車守停車，好將陪伴着一位同樣瘋狂的電影明星的靑年擲下去之外，車上還有一位眞的瘋人，他在各處貼着宗敎式的標語；「悔過吧！時候到了！」那個條　子，一張一張地發見了，在牆上、在客人的帽子上，以至於飯車上宮人吃飯的盒子上，都無不緣無故地，貼着這種紙條，弄得大家都驚異起來。後來這個瘋子被車守當塲捉住了。車守問他道；「你呌什麽名字？」那個倭老頭子仰著頭看着車守，無可奈何似的陪笑道；「這使慚愧得無以自解了。大家受了多少損失，讓我來賠償吧。我的名字呌馬季·克拉克，是拉克索·巴克索藥餅廠的總理，」車守態度很嚴厲的對着他道；「關於你的事，我已經收到了一個電報了，」克拉克很胆小似的問道；「是不是我的姪了打來的？」軍守點點頭。克拉克又問道；「是不是他說我有神經病，但是並無危險，以及他要在克利夫蘭來接我等等話！」那車守又將電報拿出來看子一看，然後說道；「不差的。不過還有一句話，他關照不得接受你的支票。你知道你幾幾乎闖了大禍。你那個「時候到了！」把客人嚇得要死。他們當着火車要出軌哩。」車守和茶房將他身上一搜，將其餘的標語沒收了。克拉克拿手扶着自已的頭喊道；「那眞可怕極了。眞是對不起得很。」車守說道；「你回你自已的房間裏去吧。我們會當心你的。」於是那老頭子自已搖着頭，走到他自已的房間裏去了。</p>
<p>他的形狀是瘋瘋傻傻的，但是並沒有什麽危險，而車上已有人比他還瘋得兇哩。那個電影明星現在正關着房門，自已扮着一個半人半羊的神怪。麗蓮亦在房間裏怪呌着，要使喬治·史密斯相信她和歐斯卡·吉甫是沒有關係的。她在房間裏，大踏步地走着。她說道；「我受不了啦！你這種人｜你這樣多心！」喬洽狠狠地對着她道；「那末你爲什麽騙我？」麗蓮喊道；「騙你？你爲什麽不讓我一個人太平些呢？你這傻子！你這瘋子！少拿鎚子來鎚我，好不好？」她突然好像再也忍受不了。他狂呌起來了，他倒在椅干裏。喬治　是立即跪了下去，柔聲安慰她道；「你爲什麽不早些這樣狂呌呢？你要是不狂呌，我還不相信你哩。我這樣疑心你，我眞自愧得很。麗蓮，我愛你！」麗蓮於是又作聲呌着：「小寳貝······小寳貝······小寳貝······媽媽喜歡你的！」她抬起頭來，從對面墻上的鏡子裏，看了自已的表演，那是多末有效呀！那種仁慈的笑容，活像一個小母親，但是又多末年輕而美麗呀！喬治亦受寵若驚似的在麗蓮的耳邊輕輕喊道：「小寳寳亦愛媽媽的。你快樂了嗎？」麗蓮一面說着：「快樂極了」！但是她的一雙眼睛，又要看看他，又要看看對面牆上的鏡子，弄得酸痛起來了。她對喬治道：「請你讓我一個人自在一回兒吧！」（未完）</p>

<h3>Tentative Discussion of Various Cases in the War Zone</h3>
<p>Wang Kemin and Xiong Bin Return North from Moganshan After Initially Exchanging Views with the Japanese Side on the Issues of Receiving Malan峪, etc. (Beiping) Fang Ping received a telegram from Yin Tong stating that he had arrived in Dalian and met with Japanese representatives. It is said that there is no conference of any kind in Dalian, only preliminary exchanges of views between the Chinese and Japanese parties involved regarding the unresolved issues in the war zone. Therefore, it is still doubtful whether the outcome of this consultation will take effect. The Chinese party involved is Yin Tong, and the Japanese party is not yet known. The scope of the exchange of views includes: (1) the entry of security forces into the war zone, (2) the takeover of Donglu, and (3) the withdrawal of Japanese troops from the Great Wall line. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Before Yin Tong left Shanghai, he and Chaisan telegraphed an agreement to meet in Dalian to discuss various issues in the war zone in detail. Chaisan arrived in Dalian from Changchun today, and Yin Tong also took the Dalian Maru north from Qingdao. It is estimated that he will arrive in Dalian tomorrow. Progress in the negotiations in the war zone can only be made after Yin Tong and Chaisan meet for discussions. Tao Shangming and Yin Rugeng did not receive Huang's telegram, so they did not go to participate. The formal meeting may be held in Pingjin榆关. (23rd Dispatch) (Beiping) Yin Rugeng said that he was not aware of the Dalian meeting. Chaisan did not send a telegram after going to Changchun. The issue of receiving Malan峪 and Japanese puppet troops can only be discussed further after Chaisan returns. Yin Tixin and Xinglong County Chief Li Ying have arrived in Malan峪 this morning to prepare everything. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japan is urging the resumption of Sino-Japanese railway through transport. Gu Mengyu is responding in Beiping with one attendant because he is in Xishan to escape the summer heat. Since the news of Mantetsu advisor Sogo's visit to Beiping for consultation has spread, all parties have paid close attention. It is now heard that Sogo's visit to Beiping has been postponed, and Yin Tong also bears considerable responsibility. However, both China and Japan deny the Dalian meeting. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Wang Kemin and Xiong Bin arrived at Moganshan to visit Huang Fu and then left the mountain one after another, carrying with them various points of Huang's guidance on the North China issue. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Reports stated that Tao Shangming and others were to go to Changchun. According to a phone call from Tangshan, Tao went to Yu on the 17th to inspect the local situation after the opening of the road. The next day, he went to Beidaihe to discuss with the security team's Zhou commander the method of maintaining security during the inspection period. He returned to Tangshan on the 20th and did not go elsewhere. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch) Yin Tong, director of the Dalian Beining Railway Bureau, arrived here at 1:00 PM today on the Dalian Maru. Mr. Yin spoke to reporters who welcomed him on the ship, saying that rumors of important negotiations with the Kwantung Army and proposals to abolish the truce agreement, etc., are fictitious propaganda. He denied the Dalian meeting and further stated that he planned to stay in Dalian for three days. Later, he took a small boat dispatched by the Army Transportation Department to Xingpu. (23rd Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Yin Tong arrived here today from Shanghai on the Dalian Maru to consult with the Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army on various issues in North China. Chaisan is also rushing here from Changchun. He had discussed the various clauses of the Tanggu Agreement with the authorities there in Changchun. It is said that if Yin Tong's purpose in this trip is to abolish the Tanggu Agreement, the Kwantung Army does not want to meet with him because the Japanese believe that the Chinese authorities have not yet fulfilled the various clauses of the agreement.

<h3>Number of Chinese Laborers Leaving the Pass</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a statement by the Yingkou Customs, the Japanese recruited Chinese laborers in the Pingjin鲁吾 area within the pass. From March 21 to the end of June, a total of 16,166 people were recruited. In addition, although there are no detailed statistics for those exported from various passes of the Great Wall, the number is also considerable. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Calls</p>
<h3>Training Speech to Trained Military Officers</h3>
<p>Discussing Military Finances of Ji Province (Beiping) Yu Xuezhong gathered the officers of his department who were participating in the second phase of military training at his residence on the 23rd morning to give a speech. The group is scheduled to go to Han on the 24th morning to transfer to Gan for training. Yu is scheduled to return to Tianjin the day after tomorrow. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong visited He Yingqin this morning to report on the progress of the Ying case and to request instructions on methods to arrest the perpetrators of the Chadian train bombing case. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong said that the provincial government sent personnel to investigate the discovery of armed bandits in Yutian County. The result was that the local security team was not strictly disciplined. In addition, due to diplomatic relations, the new security team could not enter the war zone, and the old security team could not be transferred out for reorganization, making it impossible to suppress the armed bandits. The captain of the team, Han Dianbang, is still in Yutian. Rumors of his misfortune are not true. Although the water volume of various rivers in Ji Province has once surged, it has not reached an extremely dangerous level. Reports of a Yellow River breach are inaccurate. I plan to take the train back to Tianjin tomorrow. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong said that he is scheduled to leave Ping and return to Tianjin tomorrow. Ji Province is in financial difficulty. Last year, after the Luan East war, all military expenses and the expenses for incorporating puppet troops amounted to more than 2.5 million yuan. In addition, the counties in Luan East were exempt from land tax, and revenue decreased. The total education expenses for Ji Province should be more than 3.64 million yuan according to this year's budget. Most of this money is allocated from designated taxes. After the abolition of exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes, the method of maintaining education expenses is currently being discussed with the Ministry of Finance. It is heard that the issue of the war zone will be discussed and taken over in Dalian soon. Dongling is determined to form a management committee. The detailed plan is to be drafted by Yin Rugeng and implemented after passing the Ji Provincial Government meeting. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Garrison in Ping Holds Exercises</h3>
<p>(Beiping) More than 30 Japanese troops stationed in Ping, carrying five machine guns and rifles, etc., came out of Dongjiaominxiang to the vicinity of Dongdan Archway at 8:00 this morning to practice street fighting until about 9:00. Then they lined up and returned to the Japanese barracks. (23rd Dispatch) Tianjin Municipal Government Requests</p>
<h3>Japanese Side to Stop Building Airfield</h3>
<p>Japanese Deputy Consul Tanaka Insists on Land Lease Rights, Claims That the Construction is a Sports Field (Tianjin) At the Japanese airfield in Balitai, 600 mud, tile, and wood workers suddenly gathered on the 23rd, and more than 20 trains transported wood and workers from the Japanese concession to the airfield. Under the supervision of the Japanese police, they began to build houses. The Public Security Bureau of the Provincial Capital was ordered by the province to send personnel to investigate the situation and report daily from the 23rd to prepare for negotiations. As a large amount of wood is transported daily, it is observed that the Japanese side will build aircraft hangars and indoor sports fields at the airfield, so that our side will not understand its purpose at first glance, and will change it to an airfield after a long time. (23rd Dispatch) (Tianjin) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is paying close attention to the negotiations on the Japanese construction of an airfield in Balitai, Nankai, Tianjin. It telegraphed the Tianjin Municipal Government to protest to the Japanese side and stop the construction. On the 22nd, the Municipal Government sent another protest letter to the Japanese Consul in Tianjin. On the 23rd, it also ordered Sun Runyu, the foreign affairs advisor of the government, to visit the Japanese Deputy Consul Tanaka to reserve the legal procedures for this case and hope to temporarily stop the construction and resolve everything through negotiation. Tanaka asked Sun in return, "If the construction is stopped, what good method does your side have to deal with it later?" It is impossible to cancel the Japanese lease rights and return the land. Tanaka also said that the Japanese side will never build an airfield on the land it occupies, but will use it as a sports field for Japanese people living in Tianjin to build baseball, track and field, and football fields. If it is a military airfield, it will not be built in Tianjin, but will be built in the war zone. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin French and Japanese Concessions</p>
<h3>Arbitrarily Expanding Ground</h3>
<p>Forcibly Occupying Our Old Xikai Area and Filling in the Xikai Depression Pond, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Will Initiate Negotiations (Tianjin) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is paying close attention to the Tianjin French Patrol Bureau's forced occupation of our Old Xikai area, prohibiting our police station from dispatching patrol police, and invisibly expanding the concession. The Municipal Government has recently received an order to conduct a thorough investigation and submit it to the Ministry. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will directly negotiate with the French Minister to China to ask them to return it and remove the iron fence. The Tianjin French Concession authorities are still not satisfied with occupying the Old Xikai area, and recently they want to fill in the Xikai Outer Wall Zihe Depression Pond to continue expanding the border into our territory. The Japanese Concession authorities also plan to fill in the pond to expand the Haiguang Temple Barracks. Both sides are currently using large trucks to transport dirty soil into the pit every day to fill in various places and incorporate them into the established border. The pond has an area of about 600 mu, and 30% of it has been filled in. (23rd Dispatch) Japanese in Changchun</p>

<p>Pingsui Railway</p>
<h3>Can Be Fully Restored by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>(Beiping) All places on the Pingsui Railway that were destroyed by floods have been repaired by the road bureau sending Jin Tao, the chief of the works department, to supervise more than ten road workers to rush to repair them. As of today, all places have been repaired except for one place in Sandao Camp East Tashan. In order to facilitate travel, the road bureau has specially set up large carts and foot lines in Tashan to allow passengers to cross here. From today, the Beiping Railway Station will issue special express train tickets for Suiyuan Baotou. According to road news, the gap in Tashan is about two kilometers long. Because it is necessary to open mountains and bypass roads, the project is arduous. Shen Changqian personally visited twice and set a deadline of two weeks to complete it. It is estimated that it can be completed by the end of the month. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Soviet Union Goods</p>
<h3>Fill North Manchuria Market</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to people from the Northeast, Soviet goods have recently flooded the markets in various parts of North Manchuria. In order to strictly prevent Russian goods from entering the country, the Japanese have decided to set up customs offices in the three ports of Xiongji, Luojin, and Qingjin, which border the Russian territory of the Far East, to collect duties on Russian goods imported from Vladivostok and other places. The pseudo-Ministry of Finance has included this in the so-called budget plan. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

It is reported that Koreans Cui and Pu opened gambling stalls on the streets of Jixian City on July 17, enticing people to gamble and defrauding Chinese people of a lot of money. Wang Shenhai argued with them and was beaten on the head, brain, and legs by Cui et al. with a cane. The director of the Public Security Bureau, Liu Jiaxun, summoned Cui and others to the bureau. At the same time, Korean Li Rongyu, claiming to be the chairman of the Changli Resident Association, went to the Public Security Bureau upon hearing that Cui and others had been summoned, and argued forcefully, slapping the police officer, which was very barbaric. Director Liu used Japanese to reason with him before he restrained his ferocity. Later, Cui and others were escorted to the Jiji Secret District Commissioner's Office, which sent a letter to the Japanese Embassy. The Koreans have now been detained by the embassy. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reporting on the Experience of Going South (Nanjing) Interior Minister Huang Shaoxiong said that the impression of going south was quite good, and the situation reported outside was similar to that in the Shanghai newspaper. During this trip to Hong Kong, he visited Hu Zhantang by the way and only talked about private matters, not politics. Regarding Hu's saying that he was going abroad, he did not mention it when he was in Hong Kong, so he did not know the details of Hu's future whereabouts. As for the date of his visit to Jiangxi to meet Chairman Chiang, it has not yet been decided. For the sake of the future of the country and the nation, the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities will definitely obey the orders of the central government and cooperate in the suppression of bandits. Huang went to the Ministry of Interior at noon to call all members of the ministry and members of the urban traffic police conference to hold a memorial week to give a lecture on being dedicated to public service, abiding by the law, and being clean and self-disciplined. In the afternoon, he visited President Wang at the official residence to report on the mission of this trip. At 7:00 PM, Huang hosted a banquet for all members of the Urban Traffic Police Conference at the Central Hotel and dispersed happily. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

The exact date for Chairman Huang Fu to return to Ping from the mountain has not been heard. He had not heard before whether Yin Tong was going to Dalian. He also does not know whether Vice Minister Tang Youren will go to Moganshan again. Mr. Hu Zhantang once said that he would inspect overseas party affairs, and it is heard that the central government also quite agrees with it and hopes that he can come to the meeting before going abroad.

<p>Broke and Nouveau Riche</p>
<h3>Wang's Speech at the External Affairs Ministry Memorial Week</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang gave a speech at the External Affairs Ministry Memorial Week on the morning of the 23rd, entitled "Bankrupt Aristocrats and Nouveau Riche," the gist of which is as follows: "In recent months, a very serious problem has arisen in the domestic intellectual circles, that is, why has China declined to such a state, and why is it so listless? This question naturally arises from the pain of national crisis, and further from the pain of national crisis, it arises from seeking ways to save the nation. Some people who answer this question say that it is because the Chinese nation has lost its self-confidence, forgotten that it has more than 4,000 years of culture, and fundamentally cannot muster the courage due to self-abasement. Therefore, the first priority is to restore the self-confidence of the Chinese nation. Some people say that it is because the Chinese nation lacks introspection, because China's 4,000-year culture is actually inferior to that of Europe. The Chinese nation should deeply reflect, knowing that it is inferior to others in everything, so it has created today's backward status. Without redoubled efforts, it cannot wash away the previous sins and seek future progress. Therefore, the first priority is introspection. In recent issues of "Independent Review," Mr. Hu Shihzhi has spoken most incisively on this point. Is the culture of ancient China more unique than the culture of ancient Europe, or is it inferior? This question should be left to those who study ancient cultural history to compare and research. I do not want to discuss it here. However, it is undeniable that China has its own culture. I do not want to compare it with European countries that have their own cultures, but only with a country that does not have its own culture, such as Japan. Before the Meiji Restoration, Japan accepted Chinese culture, and after the Meiji Restoration, it accepted European culture. This is common knowledge. Of course, the Japanese have their own Bushido and Yamato spirit, but generally speaking, before the Meiji Restoration, Japan's language, writing, academic thought, and even all systems and cultural relics were imitated from China. This is undeniable. Then, if ancient Chinese culture was inferior, then the culture of Japan before the Meiji Restoration could not be said to be inferior. For example, as Mr. Hu Shihzhi said, ancient China passed down several sins, such as foot binding and spanking, etc. Although the Japanese did not imitate foot binding, as for spanking, before the reform of criminal law, wasn't it just as cruel? Then why is Japan so strong today, and why is China so weak? I think it is more important to answer this question, because the origin of the national crisis and the methods of salvation may be discovered in answering this question. To answer this question, I will first make a comparison. China is a bankrupt aristocrat, and Japan is a nouveau riche. Every Chinese person will say that they are a large country and an ancient country. Large means the vastness of the territory and the size of the population, and ancient means having 4,000 years of culture. As for the fact that the economy and culture have lagged behind in recent centuries, it is an obvious and undeniable fact. This past glory and the current decline, combined, form the psychology of a bankrupt aristocrat. The descendants of any bankrupt aristocrat always have some Guanglu Di or Taishi Di-like lintels, their ancestral halls always have oil-fried ghost-style flagpoles, and their residences, although old and dilapidated, and disorganized, are also large and spacious. Their homes, of course, have some broken copper and scrap iron, called Zhou Yi and Shang Ding, and their ancestral statues are all in python robes and green belts, extremely dazzling. Therefore, these descendants of bankrupt aristocrats, even if they are currently bankrupt, are full of past glory in their hearts, thinking that although times are declining and fortunes are failing, their family is very noble and their foundation is very deep. Therefore, they unconsciously develop a kind of arrogance. This psychology is very hateful and also very shameful. They are not proud of the present, but proud of the past. This arrogant psychology leads to two results: one is insincere comparison, and the other is insincere effort. Why is there no sincere comparison? Because they have an arrogant psychology, thinking that the things passed down from their ancestors are all top-notch. Obviously, their own things are far inferior to others, but they insist that their own things are good. For example, modern medicine, they will say that it is not as good as the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic and the Medical Canon of their ancestors. Why is there no sincere effort? It is also because they have an arrogant psychology, thinking that they have their own methods. Their methods have been used for more than 4,000 years, and there are still 400 million people. Why should they be afraid, and why should they worry? Therefore, every time they are in a critical situation, they still hold the view of listening to fate, lazy and shameless. Therefore, the descendants of a bankrupt aristocrat are far less enterprising than a self-made man, because a self-made man does not have that kind of arrogant psychology in his heart. Therefore, when he encounters something, its merits and demerits are compared clearly, and he will not say that his own things, even if they are smelly, are fragrant, and that other people's things, even if they are good, are ugly. Since the comparison is clear, it is naturally easy and resolute to abandon the short and take the long. His efforts are far beyond the reach of the decadent state of a bankrupt aristocrat. Let us take an example. When American warships sailed to Yokohama, how shocked were the Japanese people? They felt that their leaf-like canoes could not be compared with these iron mountain-like warships at all. They felt that these iron mountain-like warships came to Yokohama, devouring these leaf-like canoes like a large shark devouring small fish and shrimp. There was no resistance at all. Besides working hard to quickly make iron mountain-like warships, there was no other way to escape. And because of the warships, they inferred everything else about the system, and made comprehensive reforms. The whole country worked together, as if drunk and crazy. Therefore, they created the glorious history of the Meiji Restoration. What about China? People like Peng Yulin saw foreign warships and still thought that they were not as good as their own long dragon-fast crabs. Zeng Guofan was a little smarter and knew that he had to build a shipyard, but he could not draw inferences about other cases from one instance. He thought that the only thing that foreigners were superior to us was the progress of these material things. Therefore, his theory was passed down as "Chinese learning is superior, and Western learning is superior in terms of material things," dominating for decades. In these decades, Japan made rapid progress, while China lagged behind. I think that China's backwardness in these decades, in addition to the evil deeds of the Manchu autocracy, Yuan Shikai, and the large and small warlords in the north and south, this psychology is a major reason for hindering progress. Has this psychology been eliminated now? As far as I can see, it has not been eliminated at all. Let me give a small example as proof. Now, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and other places are suffering from drought, and some people have initiated rain prayers, first in the countryside, and then in Shanghai, a place of world traffic. We are already ashamed of holding it in the countryside, because China has been running schools for at least forty or fifty years, and there are primary schools and so on in the countryside. Why can't even this kind of common sense about droughts and floods be popularized among the villagers? As for holding it in Shanghai, a place of world traffic, we are not only ashamed but also angry. Don't they really know the common sense of droughts and floods? No, there are several motivations for them to do this: one is that rain praying was passed down from our ancestors, and the methods of the ancestors are always correct; the second is that rain praying is easier and simpler than disaster relief. Gathering some Buddhas and celestial masters, shaking their heads and making gestures, is like a show, which can please people and not harm themselves. Therefore, if a rain prayer meeting is initiated, everyone applauds and agrees. If it is changed to Jiangxi and Zhejiang disaster relief bonds, and various scientific equipment to prevent drought and floods is to be prepared, then not everyone will applaud and agree. This kind of fluke psychology is made up of lazy psychology, and this lazy psychology is shared by the descendants of bankrupt aristocrats. I think that if the Chinese people cannot painfully eliminate this kind of psychology, they will not even be able to save a temporary drought or flood, let alone save the national crisis that has been accumulating for decades. Brothers believe that today, we should look forward with both eyes, not look back. In other words, we should work hard in the present, move forward to the future, and not miss the past. There was a story in Toulouse, France. Outside Toulouse, there were many wild geese. One night, when enemy soldiers attacked the city, the city's guards were sleeping. Thanks to the wild geese' strange cries, the city's guards were awakened and repelled the enemy soldiers. Therefore, these wild geese became great figures who saved the country and were respected. But decades later, these wild geese were slaughtered. When they were slaughtered, these wild geese shouted injustices, saying that our ancestors had meritorious deeds in saving the city, why are you slaughtering us today? The slaughterer said, your ancestors had meritorious deeds, that is your ancestors' business. As for you, you only deserve to be slaughtered. Hmph, descendants of bankrupt aristocrats, what does the glory of our ancestors have to do with us? The glory of our ancestors cannot wash away our shame, but our shame can bury the glory of our ancestors. If we only know how to look back at the glory of the past, then we can only fall into the situation of the geese being slaughtered in Toulouse. Starting from scratch is certainly possible, and the bankrupt aristocrats can certainly revive. As long as we get rid of the arrogant psychology, compare clearly, and work hard to do it, we can build a modern country. This is the only way to save the nation and preserve its existence, and it will also solve the problem of promoting the civilization of our ancestors." (Special telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 23rd, Minister Wang himself attended the External Affairs Ministry Memorial Week, reported on the recent diplomatic situation, and gave much encouragement to his colleagues.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>A Humble View on the Future of the Japan-U.S. Non-Aggression Treaty</h3>
<p>The London Naval Disarmament Preparatory Conference. Because Britain, the United States, and Japan each held their own opinions. Their technical arguments were different. The fundamental understanding of disarmament. It was also divergent. It was already impossible to reconcile. And at this time. The preparatory disarmament talks. Resulted in two battleships of 15,000 tons. This further sparked a resurgence of the arms race. The preparatory disarmament talks. Had to be postponed. Japan's intention for this conference. Was to break the restrictions of the Washington and London Naval Treaties. Therefore, at the London Preparatory Conference. Specialized commissioners were sent. To delay the proceedings. After the conference ran aground. Japanese Navy Captain Iwashita. Left London. Went directly to Washington. To informally exchange views with U.S. authorities. To promote a de facto understanding between Japan and the United States. Furthermore, they planned to probe the U.S.'s intentions. To conclude a Japan-U.S. non-aggression treaty. However, there is something strange about this. The Soviet Union previously proposed a non-aggression treaty to Japan. The Japanese refused. Why now do they want to conclude a treaty of the same nature with the United States? The intention is probably nothing more than two points.</p>
<p>(1) Japan wants to take this opportunity. To urgently stabilize its hegemony in the Pacific. When the United States recognized the independence of the Philippines. Japanese public opinion vigorously urged it. Hoping that the United States would abandon its military defense in the Far East. Japan can expand its so-called sphere of influence. To extend its commercial economy. From the Philippines to the various South Seas possessions. The Japan-Netherlands consultations. Have gradually reached a stalemate. Anglo-Japanese economic relations. Are also irreconcilable. If the independence of the Philippines. Can be achieved early. Then Japan can have more tools to manipulate. Therefore, it superficially raises the banner of the Open Door Policy, trying its best to show goodwill to the United States, and obtains diplomatic advantages. To open up the current difficulties in its foreign trade.</p>
<p>(2) The economic development of the United States. In Europe, it has already felt blocked. It is even more difficult to make inroads into the Far East. Only in South America, under its Monroe Doctrine. Can it still roam freely. Investment in commercial businesses. Has surpassed the old power of Britain. But since the panic of 1929. The countries of South America have been severely hit. U.S. exports. Have also decreased year by year. Until last year. It actually decreased by more than 80% compared to the past. Japan's exports to South America. Have increased year by year. And they echo Britain. Dumping at extremely low prices. To resist the United States. Therefore, U.S. trade with South America. Has declined even more. At the same time, Japan has obtained so-called priority interests in the Far East. Recently, the Governor of Taiwan convened a conference of consuls in South China. All the proposals. Are centered on developing trade with South China. To put it bluntly, they want to manipulate trade in South China. To prevent the further advance of the United States. Japan treats the United States in this way. Yet now it speaks of a non-aggression treaty. It is just a smokescreen to appease the United States and ease U.S. atmosphere.</p>
<p>Moreover, the development of events goes even further than this. After the Inukai Cabinet was formed. The new Five-Minister Conference began on the 14th. Its initial agenda was how to abolish the 5:5:3 naval ratio. To realize the demand for equality in armaments. And in practice, to expand the strength of the navy. Japan's only excuse. Is that its overseas trade has gradually progressed to the whole world. Therefore, it should have sufficient naval power. And air power to protect overseas shipping routes. The Japanese also plan to expand their maritime defense line. With Yokosuka as the center. Draw a circle with a radius of 1,200 nautical miles. As the scope of its military defense. If so, then its southward advance will cross Guam and approach Australia. Southwest it will cross Taiwan and spy on Hong Kong. Westward it will advance from Sasebo to Shanghai.</p>
<p>But Japan also knows deeply that engaging in military expansion alone. Will inevitably arouse the suspicion of the great powers. And the outcome of modern warfare. Will inevitably be decided by the strength of economic preparation. Therefore, the Minister of Agriculture in the Saito Cabinet. Vigorously advocated the theory of rural industrial cooperative centrism. To awaken the economic movement of self-reliance. It also advocated rural self-sufficiency. As a preparation for extraordinary events. As for the industrial and commercial aspects. It also established a consistent policy of controlled economy. To formulate various laws. As the basis for implementing control. From a purely economic standpoint. This inevitably has the suspicion of hindering industrial development. But for the sake of military preparation. It is certainly an inevitable phenomenon. After the Okada Cabinet was formed. It still considered the former to be insufficient. It went a step further and advocated a "unified national economic policy." To strengthen the original laws. And wait for the outbreak of war. From this, it is even more evident that the so-called "Japan-U.S. non-aggression treaty." Is merely a tool for the Japanese to play diplomacy. Smart as the Americans. They will certainly not be deceived by it.</p>
<h3>The Notorious American Bandit is Executed</h3>
<p>Chicago's most famous and ruthless bandit, Dillinger, has repeatedly committed murder and robbery, and the authorities have offered a reward for his capture. Today, he watched the movie "Manhattan Melodrama" at a theater north of Chicago. After the show, two women followed him, and they left the theater together. At this time, government officials had received a tip and sent many police officers to wait outside. After waiting for two and a half hours, they saw Dillinger come out and immediately opened fire. Dillinger was unable to resist and suffered serious injuries. One bullet pierced his head, and another bullet hit his chest. He immediately fell to the ground and died. One of the two women was injured and took advantage of the chaos to jump into a car and escape.</p>
<p>Another telegram from eyewitnesses said that there were fifteen police officers waiting outside the theater for Dillinger. When Dillinger came out of the theater, he looked around and realized he was being ambushed. He immediately reached into his pocket to take out his gun, but the police had already fired. Dillinger immediately fell dead in an alley next to the theater. When officials inspected Dillinger's body at the theater, they found that Dillinger was stronger than before, had grown a beard, and had shaved his eyebrows. There were gunshot wounds on his chest, which were recently healed. Officials wanted to get his fingerprints, but found that the skin on his fingertips had been worn flat, probably by lye.</p>
<p>Another telegram said that Detective Chief Purvis received a tip on Saturday night that Dillinger would be at the movie theater that evening. The Detective Chief secretly deployed detectives around the theater and parked his car near the theater to personally observe. He saw Dillinger buy a ticket and enter the theater. After the movie ended, Dillinger walked out. As he walked past his car, the Detective Chief gave a signal, and the detectives gathered around. Dillinger was immediately startled and ran into an alley, pulling out his gun. But there were detectives lying in ambush in the alley. Before Dillinger could fire, the detectives preempted him, and Dillinger fell to the ground and died. According to the Detective Chief, he originally intended to capture him alive, but fearing that he would resist to the end, he had no choice but to shoot him in a vital spot. The Detective Chief also said that Dillinger originally had a scar on his face, which could be used for identification, but this scar had been removed by surgery. Local police said that Dillinger was not accompanied by any women when he left the theater. (Reuters telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Declaration</p>
<h3>Vigorously Expand the Navy</h3>
<p>Air Defense Investigation Report Released</p>
<p>Aviation Industry Should Prepare for War</p>
<p>Annual Exercises in Alaska</p>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt declared today on the Houston cruiser that the United States will actively build warships within the scope permitted by the treaty. This process will take about three or four years. At the same time, a Reuters telegram from Washington stated that the special aviation committee appointed by the U.S. Department of the Army has now prepared a report advocating that Congress allocate funds to purchase 1,000 new aircraft for the Army Air Corps. If this proposal is approved, the minimum peacetime air power of the U.S. Army will be 2,320 aircraft. (Reuters telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) The joint military-civilian investigation committee's report on U.S. air defense has been submitted to Army Secretary Dern by the committee chairman, Baker. The most important recommendation is that the U.S. Army Air Corps should send at least one squadron to practice year-round flying in Alaska. Given the current situation in the Far East, and the recent proposal by the U.S. Army and Navy to open flight bases in the Aleutian Islands, the recommendation for Army flight personnel to practice in Alaska has attracted deep attention. The investigation committee's report believes that the Army Air Corps is not very satisfactory and needs to be reorganized to become the strongest air force in the world. The report states that the U.S. Navy and private aviation can be called invincible, but the Army Air Corps is far behind. The blame lies with Congress's procrastination. The investigation committee is composed of six representatives of the people and five Army officers. The chairman, Baker, was the Assistant Secretary of War during the war. The committee declared that the current situation is serious and cannot be ignored, so it made the following recommendations:</p>
<p>(1) Expand the Army Air Corps to 2,320 aircraft.</p>
<p>(2) Determine a permanent national aviation policy.</p>
<p>(3) Maintain the current system, but the Army and Air Force must have closer ties. However, merging the air forces of the Army and Navy and setting up a separate Department of Aviation is considered too expensive and impractical.</p>
<p>(4) Encourage the aircraft manufacturing industry and allow it to develop rapidly to meet wartime needs.</p>
<p>(5) Revise the internal organization of the Air Force, such as increasing the flying hours of aviation personnel from 120 or 200 hours per year to 300 hours, and add equipment suitable for aircraft to prepare for increased adventure flight training.</p>
<p>(6) Formulate a generous policy for improving experimentation and development.</p>
<p>(7) Increase the number of Air Force officers by 403.</p>
<p>The investigation report stated that the lessons learned from the Air Force's accidents while carrying airmail were valuable. In one month of carrying airmail, a total of 12 Air Force drivers died. But the report praised the Air Force's courage in serving under adverse conditions. The credible investigation report here will be the basis for the Air Force's new policy. The majority of the report was drafted by Baker after three months of detailed research. During this period, members of the investigation committee inspected Air Force bases, investigated case files, and listened to the opinions of witnesses, which was quite arduous. The committee was established on April 10 and began its actual work on April 17. Before October, it was still engaged in investigation. Witnesses who were interrogated included Colonel Lindbergh and many others. Lee, a famous wartime pilot, said that it would take the American aircraft industry seven months to meet wartime needs. Lindbergh had previously refused to join the committee due to dissatisfaction with the government's cancellation of the airmail contract, but he also accepted the committee's invitation to state his views.

<h3>The U.S. and Russia Both Attach Great Importance</h3>
<p>(New York) Former Army Air Corps Commander Mitchell declared here today that the merger of the Army and Navy Air Corps into a unified air force is inevitable. Mitchell also said that the next major war will be decided in the air. If the United States uses Alaska as an air force base, it will be able to control the whole world. Because Alaska is our only base for attacking Japan. Then why train the army, build useless warships, and throw money into a bottomless pit? (National Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Soviet Ambassador to the United States Troyanovsky predicted that the plan to connect the Pacific coast and Europe by air, with Alaska as the endpoint, is expected to be realized. The Russian ambassador declared that Alaska will soon become a key station for air routes crossing the Arctic Ocean and connecting the Pacific coast and Europe. This air route is a shortcut that will shorten the distance between Nome and Stockholm to 2,000 miles, or half a day's flight. After this route is completed, it will have great economic value for the northern United States and southeastern Siberia. (National Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Japan's Second Five-Minister Conference</p>
<h3>Discuss Relations with the United States</h3>
<p>New Submarine to be Launched on Schedule (Tokyo) Prime Minister Okada listened to the explanations of Navy Minister Osumi and Foreign Minister Hirota regarding the relevant meetings of the previous cabinet at the first five-minister conference, and exchanged opinions with each other. Later, Ambassador to the United States Saito Hiroshi clarified the intentions of the United States regarding the naval conference and its attitude towards "Manchukuo". Therefore, it was decided to convene the second five-minister conference after the cabinet meeting on the 25th. Regarding the five-minister conference at that time in the previous cabinet, its content and program will continue to be inquired in detail to Navy Minister Osumi and Foreign Minister Hirota. Foreign Minister Hirota will report on Ambassador Saito's new situation in the United States, and with the 1935 naval disarmament conference as the center, the Japanese diplomatic and national defense strategies must continue to be coordinated.

<p>Austrian Question</p>
<h3>Intention to Sever Ties with Germany</h3>
<p>Preparation to Issue a Joint Protest</p>
<p>Rome, from our Associated Press correspondent: Sources in authority revealed today that if Germany does not immediately guarantee to cease its terrorist activities within Austria, Italy will sever ties with Germany. A government official told the Associated Press that Italy's patience with the National Socialist Party's interference in Austria has reached its limit. It will hold the German government directly responsible for the continuing terrorist actions in Austria and will no longer negotiate with Munich. It is widely believed here that German Chancellor Hitler is inciting the National Socialist movement within Austria, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will have to work closely with Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss. Mussolini has been actively promoting an Italian-controlled political and economic bloc of Austria-Hungary to counter the Little Entente under French protection. Recently, rumors have spread that Italy, with French support, plans to restore Archduke Otto to the throne and reunify the Austro-Hungarian Empire, thereby creating an anti-German front. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Rome: Reports that Italy will sever ties with Germany due to continued terrorist acts by Germans in Austria have been met with laughter in political circles here. They believe that the most Prime Minister Mussolini can do is consult with other countries and issue a joint protest to the German government. However, no action is expected before Prime Minister Mussolini meets with Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss in Livorno later this week. The rumor of a German-Italian split originated from an article by Gaeta in an Italian newspaper, which strongly criticized the Hitler government in unprecedentedly harsh terms. It demanded that Germany stop its people from continuing terrorist activities in Austria, stating that Austrian and world public opinion had reached its limit and that Germany's actions were straining Italian-German relations. It seems that this article was instigated by someone, leading to speculation that Italian-German relations are now precarious and on the verge of collapse. (Reuters Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Vienna: Last night, police raided a secret meeting of the National Socialist Party in Graz and seized a large number of hand grenades during a search of National Socialist Party members' homes.

<p>St. Gallen, Switzerland: Police in St. Gallen seized a boat in Stetthafen on Lake Constance, containing explosives and bomb-making materials, including 30 landmines.

<p>Petain Warns Reserve Officers</p>
<h3>Preparing for World War II</h3>
<p>French Women and Children Must Also Fulfill Their Duties</p>
<p>(Paris) French Army reserve officers held their annual meeting in Saint-Malo today. Army Minister General Pétain personally attended and delivered a speech, elaborating on the future of a major war and how France should respond. Pétain declared that the outbreak of the Second World War would be like "a bolt from the blue." You should lead French troops directly to the battlefield, as quickly as you practice. Victory in war must be achieved within the first hour, and surprise and boldness are the two major factors that will determine the outcome of future battles. Pétain added that when war occurs, the entire nation will be involved, so the entire nation should be prepared to defend against this terrible attack, and reserve officers must constantly train the people of the whole country, so that they can cope with such accidents mentally or materially. Petain therefore expressed that the initial military training received by the French people was insufficient, and that the one-year compulsory military training implemented in 1929 was also impractical. The reason is that modern warfare weapons are changing rapidly, and the types are diverse and the structure is complex, and it is impossible to learn and apply them in one year. Therefore, extending the training period is an urgent task, and today, countries around the world are actively preparing for a desperate gamble. France must save its doctrine and its motherland, and the current military regulations have their own necessity to preserve. "France wants to maintain the peace it won by sacrificing 1.5 million heads with dignity." Pétain finally quoted Anatole France, "The day the military morality is abolished is the day the social organization collapses." Pétain concluded, "You should maintain this principle, which is also the supreme ambition of reserve officers." In this annual meeting of French reserve officers, several subcommittees were established, each responsible for studying a national defense. Some committees are examining how to comprehensively organize French military power in wartime to cope with it, while others are studying what kind of defense and assistance to war should be provided by civilians in wartime, such as changing factories to meet wartime needs, etc. The annual meeting also passed a resolution on the Saar issue, warning the government not to be alarmed by the Saar issue, but to do its best to ensure the freedom and security of Saar citizens in the self-determination in January 1933. In addition, a petition was passed, requesting the government to implement the proposal made by Mr. Peng Gu several years ago to mobilize the whole country to meet the urgent needs of the war. This bill is issued to all the people of the country, even those who cannot enter the battlefield due to physical reasons, such as women and children, should fulfill their national duties.

<p>Rogers</p>
<h3>Meeting with Japanese Finance Minister</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Professor Rogers, economic adviser to the US President who recently came to Tokyo, met with Finance Minister Fujii and Vice Minister Tsushima at 11:00 AM on the 23rd, exchanging opinions focusing on Japanese-US economic cooperation. They concluded the meeting at noon. During the meeting, Finance Minister Fujii advocated promoting Japanese-US friendship, and Professor Rogers expressed his enthusiastic support. The content of the meeting was roughly as follows: (1) The trade relations between Japan and the United States have never had conflicting interests. In the future, trade between the two countries should start with enhancing mutually beneficial relations. Both parties agreed on this point. (2) According to Professor Rogers' explanation, the United States has reduced ocean prices, mainly due to domestic relations, not an external act. I hope there will be no misunderstanding. (3) In the future, the United States' economic policy will not be changed suddenly without knowing the situation of foreign countries, but it is inconvenient to discuss specific issues. (4) Regarding the China issue, only one aspect has been investigated so far, and no conclusion has been reached. (5) At this time of deep international economic panic, Japan and the United States want to overcome it, and I hope they can shake hands and work together. Professor Rogers is scheduled to depart from Tokyo for China on the 26th of this month. I am afraid that he will not be able to meet with Finance Minister Fujii again. In the future, they will make appointments for letters to promote Japanese-US economic cooperation and contribute to overcoming the world economic panic. (Nichi-Ren Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>US to Stabilize Silver Prices</h3>

<h3>Italy Builds Largest Dock</h3>
<p>Rome: The Minister of Public Works, acting on the instructions of Prime Minister Mussolini, has decided to build the world's largest dock in the port of Naples. The senior commissioner of the port has signed a contract with a certain company, which will undertake the construction project. According to the plan, the dock will be 13 meters deep and more than 321 meters long and can be divided into two parts: (1) 200 meters long (1) 121 meters long. If necessary, it can be extended to the southwest. The project is expected to take five years and cost 50 million lira. After completion, not only can the largest existing merchant ships of various countries be repaired in the dock, but also large ships that have not yet been built or are still under construction and are more than 300 meters long can also be accommodated. In the future, Italian postal ships can find a well-equipped berthing place in the port of Naples and can be repaired in the port without having to sail to foreign docks. (Havas Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Soviet Pravda on</p>
<h3>German Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Pravda commented on Germany's economic situation, stating, "Due to the dangerous situation of the German national bank's foreign exchange reserves, the accounts with foreign merchants have never been settled as scheduled to this day. The measures taken by American bankers and the Bank for International Settlements regarding German financial activities recently undoubtedly clearly indicate the disadvantage of German foreign trade. The figures for German foreign trade in June not only show a large amount of import surplus, but also show a significant reduction in the import of industrial raw materials, while the import of food has increased. As a result, the small amount of foreign exchange reserves of the national bank continue to flow out. As for the purpose of increasing food imports, it is to prevent the large number of people who are increasingly hostile to fascist rule from reaching their limit of tolerance. The general economic and political situation of the Third Reich is so serious that we can only predict when the fascist Germany will be completely subjugated to its creditors. However, this kind of subjugation cannot save the crisis of the fascist dictatorship. On the contrary, it will make it worse." (TASS Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Korean and Taiwanese Floods</h3>
<p>Kaohsiung, Taiwan: Since the 17th of this month, southern Taiwan has been hit by rainstorms, and rivers have flooded everywhere, with many river embankments breaking and roads collapsing. There are many deaths and missing persons. (Nichi-Ren Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Seoul: The heavy rain in southern Korea has not stopped. The water level of the tributaries of the Nakdong River and the Yeongsan River is rising. The areas most affected are guarded by police and firefighters. There are hundreds of thousands of victims in North Gyeongsang Province, South Gyeongsang Province, and South Jeolla Province. Due to traffic jams, the true situation is unknown. The Busan-Seoul Railway is also closed, and thousands of passengers at Busan and Daegu stations cannot take the train, which is quite chaotic. (Nichi-Ren Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The heavy rain in South Korea has continued for days, and it has not stopped so far. It was even more intense last night. According to reports from the police in both North and South Jeolla Provinces and North and South Gyeongsang Provinces to the Ministry of Home Affairs, it has been confirmed that 14 people have died, 6 are missing, 299 houses have collapsed, and 24,124 cho of cultivated land have been lost. The number of victims has exceeded 100,000, and 25,000 people need relief. In addition, due to the railway closure, 2,000 passengers are stranded in Busan and are staying in hastily equipped train hotels, waiting for the train to open. However, the Busan Railway Administration announced that there is no hope of opening today. (Dentsu Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Polish Flood</p>
<h3>500-600 Drowned</h3>
<p>Losses of £50 Million</p>
<p>Warsaw: In recent days, local floods in Poland have resulted in an estimated 500-600 deaths, many of whom drowned because they were too busy trying to save furniture instead of evacuating to safety. Others drowned when their boats were too weak to withstand the raging currents. The number of houses swept away by the Vistula River's raging torrent, like matchboxes, causing fatal injuries to those inside, is also not small. The material losses are enormous and will prevent the region from recovering for many years. According to reliable estimates by government experts, the losses amount to £50 million. If the water does not recede immediately, this number will continue to increase. The authorities are also concerned about the outbreak of epidemics in the disaster area, which would be an even more unimaginable disaster, and are now making every effort to prevent it. This flood has left countless small farmers destitute, with many surviving alone. The Vistula River is still rising and may destroy even more areas than it does now. Thousands of people are gathered on both sides of the river, watching their homes and belongings swept away by the raging torrent, and the grief is imaginable. The ability of Warsaw to escape damage is now a matter of concern to the general public. The Vistula River in Warsaw, which is usually only 200 yards wide, has now expanded to about half a mile.

Today's temperature in Chicago is 38 degrees Celsius, and it is predicted that it will break the record of 39.5 degrees tomorrow. The temperature in New York is 33 degrees, but it is tolerable because of the breeze. In Indiana, the temperature is above 38 degrees, and in St. Louis it is 39 degrees. In Spirling Jielte City, Illinois, it is 41 degrees. In Chicago, 7 people died of heatstroke on Friday, 21 on Saturday and Sunday, and 17 on Sunday. A total of 61 people died in Illinois, 37 in Omaha, and 12 in Ohio. It is estimated that the harvest in Arkansas will be reduced by 25 to 50 percent, and the forage harvest in Louisiana will be reduced by 40 to 50 percent. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>King Travels in Third Class</h3>
<p>Andorra, located between Spain and France, is a small country with an area of only a few dozen square kilometers and a population of only 5,000. Recently, a man claiming to be the King of Andorra, named Boris I, was deported by the Spanish authorities. Before leaving, he said that he could not travel in third class, saying that he was a king and had to sit in a first-class sleeper car, and said that remittances would arrive today, and the travel expenses for the first-class sleeper car would be paid by him. The authorities then allowed the deportation to be delayed, but so far, the remittance has not arrived. Therefore, this Boris I will be deported by the Spanish government at its expense on Sunday, still traveling in third class. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Soviet Harvest Progresses Rapidly</h3>
<p>(Moscow) All Soviet newspapers report that the rapid progress of the harvesting work of state-owned and collective farms is another clear proof of the better organization of this year's agricultural work. By July 15, more than 300,000 hectares of state-owned grain farms had been harvested and accumulated, while on the same day last year it was only 35,000 hectares. The plowing of fallow land is also the same. By July 15, state-owned and collective farms had plowed more than 25 million hectares of fallow land and reclaimed 732,000 hectares of wasteland. On the same day in 1932, only 20.5 million hectares of fallow land had been plowed. (TASS Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>Chen Gongbo's Report</p>
<h3>Drought Relief Measures</h3>
<p>At the Central Memorial Week (Nanjing) The Central Government held its 140th Memorial Week at 8:00 AM on the 23rd, attended by Ye Chucang, Chen Gongbo, Chen Ce, Li Jingzhai, Li Ciwen, Wang Qi, Ke, Xing'e, and all staff, totaling over 600 people. Chairman Ye Chucang, Chen Gongbo reported, roughly stating that this year's severe drought since the beginning of summer has caused drought disasters in various provinces along the Yangtze River, with Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces being the most severely affected. Rice crop yields in Jiangsu province are estimated to be reduced by 60 million dan, Zhejiang by 18 million dan, and Anhui only has 30% of the harvest. Crop yields in the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai are also mostly less than 50%. Regarding the drought disaster, the government ordered various provinces and cities to take precautions at the beginning of this month, and also ordered the purchase and storage of late-season crops and drought-resistant seeds, as well as the purchase of water pumps to provide relief. Subsequently, the focus shifted from drought relief to disaster relief, and it was decided that the government would establish a grain transportation and sales bureau to coordinate efforts, and also organize public relief efforts, focusing on rural construction. However, after this drought disaster, we felt that three things should be noted: (1) Due to the government's financial difficulties, many plans and relief efforts cannot be implemented quickly. In the future, the government should set policies before discussing budgets. (2) The so-called water conservancy should not only prevent floods but also consider drought prevention. (3) If disasters and droughts come and we only rely on gods and superstitions, it will not help. We should vigorously promote social education, and the Party should also work hard on the people's movement to break this kind of superstitious belief, etc. (23rd Central Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Beining-South Manchuria Railway Resumes Through Transport on August 1st</h3>
<p>= Japanese side will again demand that China and Japan discuss unresolved wartime issues regarding railway through transport in Changchun. According to a Beiping dispatch, the through transport of passengers and goods on the Beining Railway and the South Manchuria Railway, which had been suspended since the September 18th Incident, will be restored after the opening of the railway between Beiping and Shenyang, which has been repeatedly requested by the Japanese side. The Beining Railway Bureau has now agreed to temporarily restore passenger transport and decided to start selling through tickets from August 1st, but only for passenger transport on the Beining Railway and the South Manchuria Railway inside and outside the passes, excluding other railways. Recently, it has been rumored that after the opening of the railway between Beiping and Shenyang, the Japanese will further demand through transport on the Sino-Japanese railways, as a further step of economic aggression. Railway Minister Gu Mengyu arrived in Beiping yesterday, and Shihe, a director of the South Manchuria Railway, will also enter the pass for consultations. However, Shen Chang, director of the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau, denied this. According to Shen, "The Beining-Ping-Sui Railway was originally connected in the 13th and 14th years of the Republic of China. Passenger and freight cars could pass each other. Later, due to military destruction, passenger cars stopped crossing the track, and freight cars continued to pass as usual. Since June 1st of this year, all stations on the entire Ping-Sui line have implemented through transport with domestic railways, and there are more and more vehicles crossing the tracks. The old damaged joints and track switches have also been repaired. Passenger cars have been changed to run on this railway to benefit passengers. This is actually an automatic improvement of the railway's business. When Mr. Shihe, a director of the South Manchuria Railway, came to Beiping this spring, I also met with him, but he is now at the end of his four-year term and is about to retire. How can a common idle person represent the South Manchuria Railway to negotiate in Beiping? As for Minister Gu's visit to Beiping, it is to take this opportunity to focus on completing the plans for the Guangdong-Han, Yu-Ping, and Xi-Lan railways. His attitude is very positive, and there is no talk of leaving his post," and so on.</p>
<p>Regarding the wartime issues, Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming have repeatedly consulted with Chaisan, a military attache of the Japanese Embassy, and Yiwo, the chief of the Japanese special service agency in Yushu, in Pingyu, but no results have been achieved. After Chaisan and Yiwo went to Changchun, Tao Shangming also took the Ping-Shen railway car from Tangshan on the 18th to Changchun. Yin Tong, director of the Beining Railway Bureau, discussed with Huang Fu in Mogan Mountain the Chinese side's policy on the wartime issues, and exchanged views with Tang Youren in Shanghai. He also took a boat from Shanghai to Dalian today (the 21st) and transferred to Changchun. The Chinese and Japanese sides will conduct concrete negotiations on the wartime issues in the pseudo-capital. Yin Rugeng and Lei Shourong, who are related to the wartime issues and the Tanggu Agreement, will all go to participate. The meeting will be held no later than the end of this month. Huang Fu's return trip to the north will depend on the outcome of the meeting. (21st)</p>
<p>Taiwan Governor-General Convenes</p>
<h3>Consular Conference on the Opposite Shore</h3>
<p>Fuzhou, Shantou and other five consuls attend a three-day meeting to discuss a wide range of issues. Xiamen Communication: The Japanese Governor-General's Office in Taiwan originally planned to convene the "Consular Conference on the Opposite Shore" in mid-June when Taiwan Governor Nakagawa went to Tokyo to seek instructions and returned to Taiwan. That is, a meeting of the five Japanese consuls in Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou. Later, in order to avoid international attention, it announced a postponement and decided to hold the meeting in the conference room of the Governor-General's Office in Taipei, Taiwan, from July 18th to 20th, and changed the name of the "Consular Conference on the Opposite Shore" to the "South China Consular Officials Conference." The Japanese consuls in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Shantou took the Fengshan Maru to Xiamen on the 10th of this month, and the Japanese consul stationed in Xiamen went on the same ship. According to the Japanese consulate here, the Taiwan Governor-General's Office holds a meeting of South China consular officials every summer, and this year is just following the usual practice. However, on the 10th of this month, the Taiwan authorities announced the purpose of this "Consular Conference of Five Consuls on the Opposite Shore," saying that "because there are many Taiwanese people in various places on the opposite shore, we want to protect these people passively and seek economic advancement and cultural contribution actively, and to complete various connections for Sino-Japanese friendship, so we are holding this meeting to discuss various matters that should be done." It can be seen what its intention is. The attending consuls are: Tsukamoto Takeshi, the Japanese consul in Xiamen; Usami, the Japanese consul in Fuzhou; Harada, the Japanese consul in Shantou; Hattori, the Japanese consul in Guangzhou; and Ashino, the Japanese consul in Hong Kong. Hiratsuka, the chief of the Governor-General's Office, is the chairman, and Kumazawa, the chief secretary of the Governor-General's Office, and Sakaguchi, the chief of the security section, are the secretaries. In addition, the participants are: Obhama, the chief of the internal affairs department of the Governor-General's Office; Ishigaki Bun, the chief of the police affairs section; Anbu, the chief of the education bureau; Tajiri, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Araki, an official of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs; and Yamada, a minister to China. The agenda is: opening the meeting on the 18th, with a three-day session. The opening ceremony will be held at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th. Taiwan Governor Nakagawa will attend the meeting to read the Emperor's edict on leaving the League of Nations and announce the Governor-General's expectations and policies for the meeting. Then Hiratsuka, the chief of general affairs, will take the chair and begin to discuss the cases and matters under the jurisdiction of the Document Section. The meeting will resume at 1:30 p.m., and at 2:00 p.m. it will be matters under the jurisdiction of the Document Section, and at 4:00 p.m. it will be matters under the jurisdiction of the Colonial Industry Bureau. The meeting will open at 9:00 a.m. on the 19th, and the discussions will be on matters of coordination, matters of hope, and matters of reliance. Until noon, it will be matters under the jurisdiction of the Police Affairs Bureau. The meeting will resume at 1:30 p.m., and at 3:00 p.m. it will be matters under the jurisdiction of the Finance Bureau, and at 4:00 p.m. it will be matters under the jurisdiction of the Education Bureau. The meeting will open at 9:00 a.m. on the 20th, and the discussions will be on matters of coordination, matters of hope, and matters of reliance. Until 10:30 a.m., it will be matters under the jurisdiction of the Transportation Bureau, and at 11:00 a.m. it will be matters under the jurisdiction of the Monopoly Bureau. Until noon, it will be matters under the jurisdiction of the Higher Court Inspection Bureau. The meeting will resume at 1:30 p.m., and at 2:00 p.m. it will be matters related to civil affairs, and at 4:00 p.m. it will be matters under the jurisdiction of the Navy and Army. Representative consuls will deliver closing remarks. According to a telegram from Taiwan here, the meeting opened on the 18th. Governor Nakagawa, Chief Hiratsuka, directors of various bureaus, consuls, and other related personnel all attended. First, Governor Nakagawa held up the Emperor's edict and expressed the main purpose of the attitude toward South China. Chief Hiratsuka took the chair, and the first day discussed matters related to the Document Section and the Colonial Industry Bureau. The Japanese consuls in Fuzhou and Xiamen requested the Governor-General's Office to restore the Foreign Affairs Section, and the resolution was passed. The discussions on the 19th and 20th were conducted according to the agenda. Judging from the fact that the participants in this Taiwan Consular Conference on the Opposite Shore included the Chief of the Governor-General's Office and representatives from various bureaus, as well as representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, and that the agenda was about colonial industry, education, police affairs, justice, finance, and naval and military affairs, it can be seen that its mission is not only to connect the consular officials stationed abroad.

<p>Zhou Hunyuan's Troops</p>
<h3>Advance on the Old Nest of Xingguo</h3>
<p>| Already crossed the Gan River and advanced |</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: The west bank of the Gan River has always been garrisoned by the national army to maintain administrative rule, while the east bank has been occupied by bandits and has been in a state of anarchy for a long time. The two banks of the east and west face each other with soldiers and bandits. Since the national army's fifth encirclement and suppression, the Northern Route Army has advanced southwestward from eastern Jiangxi along the Jiangxi-Fujian border. In addition to the Third Route Army having already approached Shicheng and Ningdu, the Sixth Route Army, including Xue Yue's troops, is gradually approaching Yongfeng, Ji'an, and Xingguo, near the old nests of Liangcun, Donggu, and Fuyou on the east bank of the Gan River. According to front-line news, the bandits of Mao Zedong and Chen Yi on the east bank are also building fortifications and pillboxes along the east bank of the Gan River. The pillboxes they build are mostly dug underground, about five or six feet to one zhang deep, in two layers, not only to resist guns and artillery, but also to prevent aircraft bombing. It is heard that Zhou Hunyuan's troops, after concentrating in Taihe, have successively crossed the river and attacked and advanced in the direction of Guanxi and Guping, destroying many pillboxes built by the bandits. Everywhere they go, the scene is desolate. Men and women are all coerced by the Red Bandits to carry food into the mountains, and only the old, weak, sick, and disabled are left, groaning in the broken courtyards and walls. The bandits are still taking the old method of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields, but the national army and the highway promote each other, and the transportation and supply are much more convenient than before. The bandits' poisonous plan has no way to be implemented. (20th)</p>
<h3>Drought Situation in Shandong Province Has Developed</h3>
<p>= Seedlings wither, autumn harvest hopeless, grain prices soar, farmers hope for rain =</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been dry and the temperature has been extremely high, creating a new record unseen in decades. Due to the lack of rain, the seedlings in Shandong have been exposed to the sun and have withered. Farmers' autumn harvest is almost hopeless, and grain prices have soared as a result. In May of this year, when wheat matured and was harvested, each hundred jin sold for only two yuan and eight jiao, but now, less than two months later, it has risen to three yuan and nine jiao or four yuan, and is still rising. Each bag of flour had previously fallen to one yuan and seven jiao, but now it has risen to two yuan and six jiao. The price of raw rice, which was three yuan, has also risen to four yuan and three jiao. In terms of the ten major food crops in Shandong, only wheat and raw rice are the most important. Other grains have also risen in price. The poor and working class are all complaining bitterly. Today (the 21st), the reporter met with Miao Xingcun, the chairman of the Jinan Grain Industry Association, and asked about the reason for the soaring grain prices. According to him, there are no other reasons for the soaring grain prices now. Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been hot and there has been no rain, and the seedlings have withered in the sun. Farmers' hopes for autumn have been cut off. In May, the drop in wheat and flour prices was actually unprecedented since there were flour companies. Last year, the price of wheat was still more than five yuan per hundred jin, but this spring it fell to two yuan and eight jiao. Now, although it has risen to three yuan and nine jiao or four yuan due to the drought, it is still rising. According to the current situation in various places, even if it rises to six yuan per hundred jin in the future, it cannot be considered a large price. Farmers are thirsty for rain. If there is no rain in the next ten days or so, farmers will inevitably be unable to maintain themselves. The severe drought situation has already developed.</p>
<p>The provincial government chairman Han Fuju recently telegraphed Chairman Jiang and President Wang, reporting on the hot and droughty situation in the province. The telegram said, "Since the beginning of summer in Jinan, there has been a lack of rain and the temperature has been increasing. Unexpectedly, on the first (13th) and the cold (14th) days of this month, the temperature rose to more than 110 degrees, and even indoors it was between 105 and 106 degrees. The scorching sun is like a raging fire, and residents who suffer from heat stroke and die instantly, according to the report of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, there are dozens of people in total, excluding those who are treated and cured at any time. I ordered the Finance Department to immediately issue 2,000 yuan to the bureau to purchase summer medicine and distribute it to the police on duty for rescue. Although the weather has been slightly cooler in recent days, it has not rained for a long time, and it is the time when hundreds of grains are spitting out ears. How can such a long drought be tolerated? What is the fault of our people to suffer this misery? Every time I think about it, I forget to sleep and eat. All the recent hot and droughty situation in Shandong Province should be reported by telegram. I beg you to be aware of it. Your servant Han Fuju bows and secretarial seal," (21st)</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui near Guangdong</p>
<h3>Will Go to Dongguan Native Place to Visit Relatives</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Dr. Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Committee and a judge of the Hague International Court, recently returned to China on vacation in Europe. After arriving in Hong Kong, he met with Hu Hanmin several times. After staying for a few days, the Southwest Political Council sent representatives Deng Qingyang and Secretary Xie Yibang to Hong Kong to welcome Wang's visit to the province. Wang also planned to return to his native Dongguan County, so he returned to Guangdong with Deng and Xie on the 16th. On that day, 30 or 40 of Wang's relatives and friends welcomed him at the pier. At about 6:00 a.m., Wang disembarked from the Hong Kong ship Taishan and shook hands with each of the welcomers. Wang was wearing a white gown, holding a cane, and in good spirits. He exchanged greetings with everyone and then drove to Tuisiyuan for rest. At about 9:00 a.m., Deng Zhiru, Zou Lu, Xiao Focheng, and other members of the Southwest Political Council arrived one after another. After breakfast, Wang and Xie Yibang visited the military and civilian authorities. At 6:00 p.m., the Southwest Political Council hosted a banquet to welcome Wang. Wang spoke eloquently about the international situation, and he knew it like the back of his hand. The reporter visited him on that day. According to Wang, his return to China this time was due to the International Court's vacation, and he planned to stay in the province for a while before returning to his hometown to reunite with his elders, relatives, and friends. He has been away from the country for a long time and is out of touch with national and local affairs, so he has no opinions to express. The current international situation is complicated and confusing, and the whole world is affected by the economic depression. Due to issues such as war debts and unemployment, the political situation in various countries is often unstable. In the Far East, the Japanese are ambitious and incite pseudo-organizations to occupy eastern provinces, which has caused adverse effects on European and American countries. Recently, due to international misunderstandings, countries are competing in armaments. Major countries, even small and peace-loving countries such as Switzerland and Belgium, are forced by the environment to strengthen their armies. The confrontation between countries is becoming increasingly serious, and the Second World War may break out at any time. Fortunately, the diplomacy between France and Germany has suddenly eased recently, and the two sides have reached a considerable agreement on the Saar region issue. He has been serving in the International Court for three years, and the more important cases he has handled include the German-Austrian Customs Union and various minority issues between Poland and Germany. Recently, the British-Belgian case against Philippines will also officially begin in September of this year. (17th)</p>
<h3>Lack of Chinese Workers in Malaya</h3>
<p>Rubber plantations and tin mines need a large number of workers. Singapore Communication: Since the prices of tin and rubber, the largest products of Malaya, have plummeted due to overproduction, all tin mines and rubber plantations have tried their best to reduce their scope. Chinese workers have no work to do, and there are many unemployed people. These people cannot stand on their own feet in Southeast Asia, so they have returned to their country one after another. Therefore, ships sailing from Singapore to China in recent years have been full of unemployed Chinese workers. However, since the recent implementation of the rubber production restriction regulations, the price of rubber has increased, and rubber plantations need a large number of workers to cut rubber. At the same time, the quota for tin mine production in Malaya has gradually increased due to the expansion of the world market. For example, the quota for April of this year was originally 30%, but it has now increased to 37.5%. Under such circumstances, the tin mines have been greatly panicked, because most of the Chinese workers they had previously employed had returned to their country due to unemployment. Now they want to increase the employment of this large number of workers, and they feel it is difficult. According to news from Kuala Lumpur, the capital of the Malay Federation, Chinese mine owners in Liangxuelai E (a Malay state) have sent people back to China to recruit 400 Chinese workers after obtaining permission from the local government, and other mine owners will follow suit.

<h3>Anhui Province Actively Prevents Drought</h3>
<p>= No Drought Expected North of the Huai River. The Construction Department Has Formed a Drought Prevention Committee =</p>
<p>Anqing Communication: Since the beginning of summer in Anhui Province, there has been a long drought without rain. Recently, the weather has been extremely hot, which is very different from the past. In Anqing, for example, the weather at noon every day in the middle of this month has been around 110 degrees Fahrenheit indoors, setting a new record for the heat in the past 60 years. Although officials and people have banned killing and prayed for rain, it is still not easy to get rain. It is not difficult to predict that the autumn harvest this year will be poor. The Construction Department, according to the reports from the counties on the drought situation, is roughly as follows: (1) The most serious situation is in eight counties: Shidai, Taiping, Ningguo, Jingde, Qingyang, Jiashan, Jingxian, and Dingyuan. (2) The next most serious situation is in twenty-one counties: Huaining, Wangjiang, Susong, Guichi, Jingxian, Hefei, Nanling, Quanjiao, Tongcheng, Tianchang, Taihu, Xishan, Tongling, Lujiang, Fanchang, Langxi, Hexian, Wuwei, Dangtu, Wuhu, and Guangde. (3) According to reports, there is no drought in eight counties: Xiuning, Huaiyuan, Shouxian, Suxian, Fuyang, and Guoyang. The situation in the remaining twenty-six counties, such as Qianshan, has not yet been reported in detail. To sum up, only the area north of the Huai River in the entire Anhui Province is expected to be temporarily free from the worry of drought. If the next most serious situation cannot get rain again, it will also become the most serious. It is feared that most of those whose situation has not been reported in detail are also in a serious situation. The Construction Department had previously organized a Drought Prevention Committee at the beginning of the gradual pressure of the drought and actively carried out the following matters: (1) Ordering the counties again to supervise the people to irrigate day and night. (2) Detailing the methods of farming in dry land. (3) Detailing the investigation of the drought-affected area and the types of agricultural products suitable for industry and commerce. (4) Selecting ordinary and applicable drought-resistant crop varieties, informing the counties to prepare seeds, and planning to purchase a part of them from the producing areas for standby use by the province. (5) Placing the two existing water-lifting machines near Anqing first, and inquiring about the prices and types from manufacturing plants to prepare for procurement. (6) Investigating the grain reserves in various places and drafting follow-up measures such as investigating people's food. (7) Circulating orders to all counties to urge the people to carry out irrigation cooperation. (8) Circulating orders to all affiliated agricultural and forestry farms to send personnel to various places to be responsible for guiding the people to divert water for irrigation and change to drought-resistant crops.

The Farmers Bank of China Songjiang Branch was designated as the agent treasury of the county. The county magistrate Jin immediately convened relevant agencies to prepare for the implementation steps. It is learned that from this month, all old tax payments have been deposited in the treasury, and all new receipts, such as county education tax, construction tax, and county taxes, have been fully deposited in the treasury in accordance with orders to ensure safety and unification.</p>

<p>County Magistrate Peng Baichuan, accompanied by Wu Xingbo, Director of the County Public Security Bureau, and Mei Xueyan, Chief of the First Section, went to the Luxiabin Autonomous Experimental Zone Office at 10:00 a.m. on the 22nd. Zhu Wenyuan, the chief of the district, gathered more than 30 people, including local gentry Jiang Zhikui and the chiefs of various townships, at the Xiaoxue school gymnasium. County Magistrate Peng personally gave instructions: (1) Ordered the chiefs of various townships to work hard to publicize the provincial ban on smoking, so as to make the smokers in this area quit smoking in the shortest possible time. (2) Assist farmers in implementing drought prevention work. (3) Unpaid contracts of various businesses should be submitted to the county for inspection within the time limit to avoid penalties. He left Lu at 12:00 noon and went to Kun.</p>
<h3>Three or Four Inches of Rain in the Four Rural Areas</h3>
<p>The county has been dry for a long time. Although the county government and various agencies raised funds to purchase water-lifting machines and distributed them to various townships, they lifted water day and night, but it was of no avail. Fortunately, the weather suddenly changed in the past two days, the weather turned cooler, and showers fell from time to time. The farmland in the four rural areas has benefited a lot. It is estimated that the townships have received three to four inches of rain in the past three days, and the farmers are all overjoyed.</p>

The association has not been out for 30 years. There are many rare treasures in the ceremonial guards of this competition. There is a jade toad, named General Qinghua, which is about two feet long. Someone from abroad once offered to sell it for 300,000 yuan, but he refused to sell it. In addition, there is a golden Qiaoduan, weighing more than 40 jin, and jadeite tuanhe umbrellas and white jade longevity umbrellas, each of which is more than eight feet around. They are exquisitely carved and priceless. There are also five purple crystal large five-sided plaques, nine jade dragons, and nine jade ruyi, two large and small jade tea boxes, all of which are rare jade objects that are not often seen. However, the association refuses to participate in gong arms, incense arms, stilts, and dragon lanterns. In addition, the Heshan Association, which is famous far and wide and has been strictly forbidden by the official hall, is also scheduled to be held in Fuguo on the 29th. In addition, the Flower King (according to legend, Emperor Tang Ming) enshrined by the flower and tree industry is also scheduled to be held on the 26th. The ceremonial guards are all tied with fresh flowers, which is quite unique. There are also a large number of flower-selling women, who are praised as the seven li of Shantang, wearing fresh flower coats, playing fairies, and singing the song of feather clothing.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Water-Lifting Machines Arrive</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department yesterday (the 23rd) allocated 12 water-lifting machines to Suzhou, ordering the county government to distribute them to various townships for water-lifting for farmland.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<h3>Flood Dam Officially Opened</h3>
<p>In order to relieve the drought, the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department plans to set up water stations at Liangxikou in the county and Shatun Port in Wangting to draw water from rivers and lakes, and sent engineer Wang Yuanxian to Wuxi to be responsible for handling it. After surveying, it was decided to change the Liangxikou water station to Miaogang Bridge outside the East Gate. On the Shatun Port side, it was decided to open the earth dam of the floodgate, and the work has already started. In the past few days, engineer Wang, because the weather has changed and there is a phenomenon of flooding, has specially opened the dam temporarily. In addition to telegraphing the department for instructions, he also went to the province to report everything in person. The Construction Department decided on four measures: (1) The floodgate should still be opened. (2) The Weiting water station is exempt from establishment. (3) The Miaogang Bridge water station should be established as soon as possible. (4) The distribution of machines should be 12 units each for Suzhou and Wuxi counties. Yesterday morning, the gate was officially opened, and the water level in the port suddenly increased by two or three centimeters due to the rain. The water level of Taihu Lake rose by more than one foot. After Hu was opened, the water flow was turbulent. As for the future problems of the dam, it was decided to build a sluice gate, which would be opened and closed depending on the water level. In addition, after the establishment of gates in Huangtiangang, Huangshangang, Xiagang, and Shengang in Jiangyin, the water level has greatly increased. At this moment, the tide has rushed to Sanhekou, Shaoxiang Bridge, Sihe, and Shichuang. The river channel, which had been blocked for more than half a month, has also been unblocked. Wuxi and Wu counties have both benefited. Regarding the water-lifting machines in the port, Wu Shuying, chairman of the Cheng County Chamber of Commerce, went to Shanghai to handle it, and is now equipping the electricity. It is expected that water can be drawn within two or three days, and it is planned to expand the original plan and use foreign pine wood to set up gates in the large ports along the river, so that the efficiency can be quickly improved.</p>
<h3>Wealthy Merchant's Concubine Arrested for Setting Up an Opium Den</h3>
<p>Li Yanchen, a wealthy merchant who had previously opened the Maoji Cloth Shop, has now passed away. His concubine, Chen, lives at No. 24 Houzhuchang Lane. The Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau received a report a few days ago that Li Chen's house had opened a gambling den and sold opium. Qiang Chucai, a bureau member of the bureau, led the police to arrest her. Unexpectedly, Li Chen had already heard the news and cleaned up the gambling den. Qiang ordered the police to conduct a search, and three jars of opium, one opium pipe, some opium ash, and tools for frying opium were found in Li Chen's room. Two men's straw hats were also found on Chen's dressing table. At that time, Yan Yunqiao, the manager of Yitaixing Coal Company under Gongyun Bridge (i.e., Yan Haozui), was also indulging in smoking and gambling at Li's house. When he saw the police officer coming, he hurriedly hid in the servant's room and pretended to lie on the bed, but was seen by the police at a glance and was taken away. Yan was stubborn at first, and Qiang ordered the police to tie him up with leggings and take him to the bureau along with Li Chen and the smoking certificate, and send him to the General Bureau. Yan Yunqiao used the pseudonym Zhang Qinglin, and was soon bailed out by Sun Jiru to the General Bureau. Yesterday (the 23rd) morning, the General Bureau transferred Yan Yunqiao and Li Chen to the local branch court. After Qian, the prosecutor, opened the court for interrogation, he ordered Li Chen to pay a written guarantee of 50 yuan, and Yan Yunqiao was detained pending investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Reply Telegram Requesting Maintenance of Rong Zongjing's Business</h3>
<p>Wu Zhihui, a member of the Central Committee, had previously sent a letter to Chairman Jiang, requesting the maintenance of Rong Zongjing's business. Now, we have found the following telegram from Chairman Jiang to Wu: Wuxi Tan Tou Wu Zhihui Mr. Jian Guan, regarding the maintenance of the Rong brothers' industry, I had previously telegraphed Minister Kong. Now I have received a reply saying that I express great sympathy for Rong Zongjing's affairs and will definitely find a way to maintain it. I hereby transfer the matter for investigation, brother Zhongzheng Qiao Mi Gu, etc.</p>

<h3>Due to Prolonged Drought, Continued Prohibition of Slaughter</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, this county has suffered a prolonged drought, rivers have dried up, and planting has been difficult. Previously, well-intentioned people from various villages repeatedly carried earthen idols and crowded into the county government to implore the county magistrate to burn incense and pay reverence. However, the scorching sun remained unrelenting, yielding no results. Subsequently, various towns and villages voluntarily ceased slaughter for three days, hoping to obtain plentiful rain. However, after the three days passed, the heat remained the same. Yesterday, the county government received a provincial order to continue the ban on slaughter for three more days, and immediately dispatched personnel that night to notify all abattoirs. At the same time, they also received a provincial order strictly prohibiting well-intentioned people from taking advantage of the situation to cause disturbances for their own benefit. It turns out that some unscrupulous elements have been instigating unrest to profit from the opportunity, which is truly harming the farmers. If this is not punished, how can agriculture be protected? It is necessary to strictly prohibit such actions as soon as possible, and so on.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<h3>Wangdian Rice Trade Suspended</h3>
<p>On the 22nd, more than a hundred disaster-stricken villagers from the Haiyan border and the Sixth District arrived in Wangdian Town, Jiaxing, holding rice-washing baskets and other items, demanding rice from various rice shops. Due to poor order, the rice shops immediately suspended business. After learning of this, the county government dispatched Lu Chujue and Mei Shouren to Wangdian on the 23rd to discuss solutions. It is reported that the rice trade in the town was still suspended on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Distributing Granary Grains to Aid Impoverished Farmers</h3>
<p>After villagers in various districts of Jiaxing County reported crop failures due to drought, they requested exemption from grain taxes and distribution of granary grains. The county government convened a meeting of various committees and immediately decided to distribute all 2,000 shi of grain stored in the granaries, together with 3,000 shi of grain purchased and stored in Wuxi, totaling 5,000 shi. They are currently submitting a report to the provincial government for approval and implementation. However, the method of distribution and the date of distribution still need to be decided in a meeting.</p>

<h3>Wang Hanlun's Divorce Case Heard for the Third Time</h3>
<p>The divorce case of Wang Hanlun, a veteran movie star (also known as Peng Jianqing), and Wang Jihuan, a famous scholar from western Zhejiang, has been heard twice in the Hangzhou court. Both times, reconciliation was advised, but the two parties could not agree on terms, making reconciliation difficult. Yesterday (the 23rd) at 8:30 a.m., the Hangzhou court heard the case for the third time. Both Wangs arrived on time. Wang Hanlun wore a light lake-colored chiffon flag dress and white leather shoes, with a natural attitude, her face lightly made up. Wang Jihuan wore a snow-blue silk long gown and black satin shoes. The audience was extremely crowded. Judge Yang Delin took the bench and questioned the details of the case. Wang Hanlun stated that Wang Jihuan had promised to pay a bride price of one thousand yuan, but did not do so after the marriage. Even the monthly allowance of twenty yuan was not fulfilled. She further stated that her clothes in the Wang family's suitcase had been taken away by Wang, which Wang Jihuan absolutely denied. Wang Hanlun's lawyer, Chen Huimin, and Wang Jihuan's lawyer, Song Fu, successively stood up to argue. Finally, Wang Hanlun accused Wang Jihuan of smoking opium and of moral degradation, requesting a test. Wang Jihuan stated that he had indeed smoked opium in the years 7 and 8 of the Republic, but he does not smoke now and is willing to be tested in court. The judge ordered Wang Jihuan to go to the court at 2:00 p.m. for a forensic examination. The court adjourned at 10:30 a.m.</p>
<h3>Epidemic Rages, Pedestrians Die in the Streets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in Zhaobao Hall Alley on East Street in Hangzhou, a pedestrian named Hua Laichao fell to the ground due to an epidemic. A police officer saw this and telegraphed the Municipal Health Department, which sent an ambulance to take him to the Infectious Disease Hospital. He died despite medical treatment. Also, yesterday afternoon at the First Pier of Jianggan, a traveler, wearing a dark-colored short shirt and blue cloth trousers, intended to cross the river from Hangzhou to return to his hometown. He suddenly fell ill and died at the pier. Both cases were reported to the Hangzhou Court for autopsy.</p>
<p>Shaoxing</p>
<h3>Completion of the Cao'e Branch Road Construction</h3>
<p>The county government, in order to facilitate transportation between Cao'e and Tujia Garden Wharf, completed the construction of the Cao'e Highway branch line the other day. The estimated cost is more than 2,800 yuan, which has been reported by the county government to the provincial department for dispatching personnel for inspection and acceptance.</p>
<h3>Preparing for Epidemic Prevention After Drought and Flood</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, Shaoxing has experienced extremely hot weather and a prolonged drought with no rain. Recently, there have been occasional showers, so there is no longer concern about withered crops in the countryside. However, because the weather is irregular, alternating between cold and hot, it is easy to breed epidemics. The Yue Society, organized by local gentry and merchants in the city, convened a board meeting yesterday to discuss epidemic prevention measures, in order to prevent the spread of epidemics. The following was decided: (1) First, the old Kuaiji County Epidemic Prevention Office will be assisted and expanded as much as possible, vaccinations will be given in rotation, and medicines will be continuously distributed. (2) If an epidemic breaks out, multiple rescue teams will be immediately established within the society to set out separately to provide rescue at any time. (3) Vacant houses in secluded locations or suitable temples will be borrowed to establish formal epidemic prevention hospitals and specialized doctors will be hired for treatment. (4) Various medicines for treating fever and brandy will be purchased and distributed as much as possible for use.</p>

<h3>Xiong Zhugao Receives No Prosecution</h3>
<p>Wu Molin, an accountant at the Education Bureau, was reported for being addicted to smoking opium. On June 26, the county sent him to Renji Hospital for examination. After arriving at the hospital, Wu left Cheng for Shanghai under the pretext of fetching something. Later, Director Tai sent Xiong Tongfu to pursue him and bring him back to the hospital, where he was examined and found to be addicted to opium. He was sentenced to fifty days of detention. Subsequently, Xu Yucang and others sued the county, accusing Xiong Zhugao, the director of the Education Bureau, of shielding his subordinate who smokes opium, allowing him to escape. The county concluded its investigation and ruled that, in accordance with the precedent of the former Dali Court's ruling No. 89, he would not be prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Farmers Transplant Seedlings After Good Rain</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has changed, just like early autumn, with alternating rain and sunshine. The city and countryside have had several showers, accumulating two to three inches. The sky is covered in clouds and mist, still suggesting rain. Farmers are still transplanting seedlings, hoping to salvage the situation. Yesterday (the 21st), County Magistrate Bao specifically instructed the district chiefs of each district to instruct all farmers in the fields that have not yet been transplanted to replant late rice or beans to save the crops. He also ordered them to investigate and report in detail on the farmland in their respective districts that has not been transplanted, the types of crops currently being replanted, and the situation in the disaster-stricken areas, so as to facilitate inspection and verification. The Drought Relief Committee believes that after the gates were set up in Huangtian Port, Huangshan Port, Xiagang, and Shengang, the water level has risen greatly, and the tide has passed through Sanhekou, Burning Incense Bridge, Sihe, and Stone Pagoda. Wuxi and Wujin have also benefited, and the county should consult with the counties of Wuxi and Wuxi to provide appropriate subsidies to ease the burden.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<h3>Disaster Apparent, Please Allocate Seeds</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, this county has experienced drought and little rain, resulting in withered crops and a clear disaster. County Magistrate Ma Zhenbang, having read reports about the Ministry of Industry's proposed drought prevention and relief measures, petitioned the Executive Yuan to allocate 800,000 yuan to purchase seeds for distribution to farmers. Yesterday, he specifically submitted a report to the provincial government and the Departments of Finance and Construction, requesting the swift allocation of buckwheat, mung bean, radish, and turnip seeds for distribution, so as to avoid leaving the fields barren.</p>
<h3>Unwilling to Bid, Petition to Stop Taxes</h3>
<p>Miao Qiujie, the Salt Commissioner of Huai'an, stated that the salt in Xiang-E-Xi (Hunan, Hubei, and Western Anhui) is already being sold freely through bidding. He ordered the Anhui merchants to imitate the practices of the three regions and set up eight bidding offices in Anhui Province. Otherwise, the government would set them up on their behalf. The Anhui merchants, however, believe that bidding in the three regions has already led to a decline. They do not want to follow suit. Therefore, at 2:00 p.m. on the 21st, they convened a general meeting and unanimously decided to immediately suspend the payment of taxes. They also appointed representatives, Zhu Yongren and others, along with Xiong Shengwu and others from the E-Xi Ticket Merchants Relief Association, to go to Beijing and Shanghai to petition, striving to cope with the situation and aiming to abolish the bidding system.</p>

<h3>Guangdong-Hankou Railway Loan</h3>
<p>The Safeguarding Committee will be jointly established by the Ministries of Railways, Finance, and Audit, and the Boxer Indemnity Committee will dispatch members. The British gold bonds have been printed and will be issued on the first of next month, according to Xin Sheng She. The six-percent British gold Boxer Indemnity bonds of 1934 were issued on June 1 and underwritten by four banks, including the Bank of China. The bonds have been printed and will be issued on August 1. The organization of the loan safeguarding committee is underway. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Bond Printing Completed</h3>
<p>The six-percent British gold bonds amount to 1.5 million pounds. Calculated at 16 yuan in Chinese currency per pound, this is approximately 24 million yuan in Chinese currency. After issuance, the bonds will be underwritten by four banks: Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Central Bank of China, and HSBC. The contract has been signed. The underwriting price is slightly lower than that of the 96 issuance. The bond certificates have now been printed by the Ministry of Finance and will be issued on August 1, in exchange for the previously issued subscription vouchers. The Fund Safeguarding Committee has been established, located on the fourth floor of the Central Bank.

<p>Construction Committee Seeks Loan from Shanghai Banks</p>
<h3>Three Million Yuan Loan</h3>
<p>The loan is secured by the 1933 Electricity Bonds. The contract has been signed and will be repaid in three years, according to Xin Sheng She.

Three million yuan was mortgaged to Shanghai's Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and other banks, with an interest rate of eight percent and repayment in three years.</p>
<h3>Contract Signed</h3>
<p>The banks undertaking the loan include the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China South Bank, Yanye Bank, Continental Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Siming Bank, Xinhua Bank, China Agriculture and Industry Bank, and the Postal Savings Bureau, totaling eleven institutions. They are jointly managing the loan syndicate. The loan contract was formally signed in May of this year.</p>
<h3>Electricity Bonds</h3>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng She learned yesterday that the Construction Committee had issued a total of four million yuan in short-term Electricity Enterprise Bonds and long-term Electricity Enterprise Bonds in 1930. In July of last year, another six million yuan in Electricity Enterprise Bonds were issued. The end of June this year was the date for the first principal repayment. The bonds mortgaged this time are the new bonds.</p>

<p>Rice Industry Associations in North and South Shanghai</p>
<h3>Held Joint Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Autumn harvest is not expected to be a disaster, so postpone ordering foreign rice, and send letters to the two railway administrations to expedite the shipment of rice and grain, according to Dagongshe. For the purpose of receiving inquiries from Zhang Gongquan and others, yesterday the rice industry associations in the northern and southern districts of the city held a joint meeting.</p>
<h3>Articles and Opinions for Amending the Savings Law</h3>
<p>Kong indicated that he would forward them to the Executive Yuan for review. Zhang and others will petition the Legislative Yuan again, according to Shishi She’s local report. Since the National Government promulgated the Savings Bank Law on the 4th of this month, the Shanghai banking community, considering its own interests and believing that the content of the regulations contains many obstacles to implementation, has expressed strong opposition. The Shanghai Banking Association has specifically organized a small group to study the Savings Bank Law, compile the results of the study into a written opinion, and send representatives, including Zhang Gongquan, to the government to present their case and request amendments to facilitate implementation. The Shishi She reporter is here to record the details of Zhang Gongquan and others petitioning Kong for amendments as follows:</p>
<h3>Zhang Gongquan and Others Visit Kong</h3>
<p>It is found that there are 33 banks in Shanghai that specialize in commercial savings, including Xinhua Bank, 20 banks that also engage in savings, including Continental Bank, and 5 Chinese and foreign savings associations, including Siming Savings Association. They all believe that the promulgation of the Savings Bank Law is tantamount to restricting the activities of savings banks, which will greatly hinder their future business development. Yesterday, they specifically elected four representatives, Zhang Gongquan of the Bank of China, Tang Shoumin of the Bank of Communications, Chen Guangfu of the Shanghai Bank, and Xu Xinliu of the Xingye Bank, to go to the Central Bank to meet with Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, to present the specific opinions of the banking community and request their acceptance and amendment. Kong met with them and indicated that he could consider it, but because the law was passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government, he could only forward the opinions of the banking community to the Executive Yuan for review. The Ministry of Finance has no right to amend it. Zhang and others, considering that Kong has agreed to forward the opinions to the Executive Yuan, which can then be submitted to the National Government for the Legislative Yuan to study remedial measures, were very satisfied and left.</p>
<h3>Articles and Opinions for Amendments</h3>
<p>When Zhang Gongquan and others visited Minister of Finance Kong, in addition to submitting letters outlining all the difficulties, they also presented several written opinions, the content of which is as follows: (1) Article 7, paragraph 4 of the Savings Bank Law states that savings banks may make loans using deposit slips or passbooks of other banks as collateral. However, banks in Shanghai often refuse to register requests for deposit slips or passbook deposits, so the Savings Bank Law's regulations seem inconsistent with current Shanghai customs. (2) Article 7 of the Savings Bank Law stipulates eight categories of funds that savings banks may use, and Article 8 places limits on each of these eight categories, specifying that each category may not exceed a certain percentage. These regulations seem to be based on American law, but for those using a branch system, the accounts are not in one place, making it difficult to operate in compliance with the law. Therefore, the banking laws of countries with branch systems have no such regulations. (3) The double liability of directors and supervisors is also inconsistent with the organization of limited companies, and it will be quite difficult to elect directors and supervisors in the future. (4) Article 8 stipulates that loans secured by rural cooperatives and loans secured by agricultural products must not be less than one-fifth, which also poses problems. (A) Agricultural products have no definite boundary. Do large-scale loans that banks are currently making, such as loans for flour, cotton yarn, cocoons, silk, and textiles, also count as agricultural products? (B) The organization of cooperatives cannot be completed in a short time. If the legal limit is exceeded at one time and falls short of the legal limit at another time, can they be offset? All of these opinions are critical issues for the banking community. Minister Kong, who also serves as the President of the Central Bank, has considerable experience in banking and was quite moved after reading the Articles and Opinions.</p>
<h3>Will Petition the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>Zhang Gongquan and the other four representatives believe that the power to legislate lies entirely with the Legislative Yuan. Although Kong expressed his willingness to consider the opinions, everything still needs to be presented to the Legislative Yuan. The four representatives have now decided to prepare a document within the next few days to jointly go to Beijing to petition. However, if the Savings Bank Law, which has already been promulgated by the National Government, is suddenly withdrawn and amended in a short period of time, it would severely damage its credibility. However, to obstruct its implementation and make it a mere piece of paper would also be contrary to the government's intention of serious legislation. According to general observation, there are no more than three ways to remedy the situation: (1) In the implementation rules of the Savings Bank Law, the opinions of the banking community should be supplemented as much as possible to make up for the law's deficiencies. (2) A few supplementary clauses should be issued separately. (3) The implementation should be postponed. It is believed that Zhang Gongquan and others' trip to Beijing will have a satisfactory result to promote its success.</p>
<p>The County Opposes Ordering Foreign Rice, a special discussion of the case was held at the Rengutang in Dadongmen yesterday afternoon at 3 pm. Because the autumn harvest is not expected to be a disaster, it was resolved to postpone ordering foreign rice, and a letter was sent to the two railway administrations to expedite the shipment of rice and grain to regulate the Shanghai food supply. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Associations Present</h3>
<p>Representatives from more than sixty people from forty-plus associations were accounted for, including Runtaifeng Wu Bangling, Yuansheng Run Wan Yinglong, Xiechang Mao Jiangzisheng, Tongtaigong Li Yunqing, Changfengyi Zhu Lanfen, Lu Jingwen, Wanxingyi Yan Xiaoquan, Dingshengyi Wu Dingyuan, Santai Wu Rongsheng, Yuchangtai Xu Zhiliang, Yongshuntai Gu Yisheng, Ruichangfa Fu Qiangeng, Dingfengxing Yiyuanxing Jin Zhaoyun, Taichangkang Zhu Yongqi, Yucheng Gong Zhou Langen, Dachangshen Wu Jiyun, Xiekang Peng Liansheng, Suifeng Liu Chaohan, Xinchang Zhu Zixiang, Xutai Li Bingkun, Hongsheng Wu Huizhang, Yutaixing Zhou Rongcheng, Chengtai Qian Zhang Ronglin, Yuanyuyu Dade Shen Hailin, Wantaixiang Xu Guoxun, Huiyuanfeng Chen Chengren, Xuxingcheng Wang Tianchou, Daheng Yang Shaoyuan, and Dingxingtai Zhang Lizhong.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>The meeting started at 3 pm. Lu Jingwen was elected as the chairman. After performing the customary rites, the chairman gave a report, saying, in short, that the purpose of convening today's joint meeting of rice dealers in the north and south of the city is to receive letters from the rice industries in Lili, Changshu, Wuxi, and other counties, opposing the purchase of foreign rice. However, the dealers in this city, previously, due to the drought and withered crops, which were about to become a disaster, and at the same time, the rivers in the interior were dry and goods were scarce, causing rice prices to soar. In order to prepare for future shortages and to suppress rice prices, the bean and rice industry association had a proposal to order foreign rice. In the past ten days, the weather has changed, and the sweet rain has fallen. The seedlings in various places still have hope of recovery, and the disaster situation will not be serious. The counties have also reported that there are accumulated old rice in the interior, which is enough to supply before the new grains are harvested. Judging from the current situation, the case of ordering foreign rice should be postponed. If food shortages do occur in the future, the major issue of regulating the people's food supply cannot be solved by the rice merchants alone. The government should plan for the long term so that both the people's food future and the rural economy can benefit.</p>
<h3>Resolutions of Various Cases</h3>
<p>After the chairman's report, the representatives then expressed their opinions. After the chairman summarized them one by one, they were submitted for discussion. (1) The Doumi Industry Association previously discussed ordering foreign rice to prevent shortages and suppress rice prices. Now, letters have been received from various counties, opposing this. How should this be handled? It was resolved that representatives Zhu Zixiang and Jiang Zisheng be elected to personally present the letters from the various trade associations and the situation of today's meeting to Chairman Gu (Xinyi), requesting that the order for foreign rice be postponed to maintain domestic rice and help the farmers make a living. (2) The inland rivers are dry, and it is difficult to ship goods by various routes. How to plan for land transportation? It was resolved to send letters to the Beijing-Shanghai and Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, ordering the stations along the inland lines to expedite the shipment of rice and grain to regulate the Shanghai food supply. The meeting adjourned at 6 pm.</p>
<h3>Opposition from Various Counties</h3>
<p>Since the incident of ordering foreign rice occurred, various counties have sent representatives to Shanghai to express their opposition, including Lu Gongzhen of Changshu, Li Zhongchen, Qian Jingsheng, Lu Zhuqing of Wuxi, and Tang Yangru of Wu County, and they have prepared letters of opposition.</p>
<h3>Irregular Weather, Dysentery Epidemic</h3>
<p>The Health Bureau sends personnel out every day to force residents of shantytowns to be vaccinated, according to Xin Sheng She. The Shanghai Southern Office of the Health Bureau, located on Lin Yin Road in Ximen, has been providing free vaccinations and treatment for various diseases since its opening, which has been very convenient for residents. Recently, due to irregular weather, alternating between cold and hot, it is easy to get sick with a little carelessness. According to Director You Jihua, many cases of dysentery have been discovered recently, all caused by irregular temperature changes. However, no true cholera has been found. The number of people vaccinated this year is also higher than in previous years. From May 16 to July 22, a total of more than 210,000 injections were given. The same is true in the British and French concessions. The office sends out two people as a group from 7:00 am to 5:00 pm every day, taking an ambulance to Beixinjing, Hongzhen, Xujiahui, and other places to enforce vaccinations for the residents in the shanties. It was heard that your company will convene a meeting of dealers in the north and south of the city at 3 pm this afternoon to discuss the matter of ordering foreign rice. The representatives came specifically because of this matter, and we have therefore written a letter to convey our opinion. We hope that you will consider the overall situation and the rural economy seriously. Otherwise, the ink of the tax increase has not dried, and the request for tax exemption is seen again. Going back on your word may be laughed at by foreign merchants. Is this appropriate? We respectfully ask your association to consider and approve.</p>
<p>American Missionary Dr. Smith</p>
<h3>Passed Through Shanghai Last Night on His Way to Guangdong</h3>
<p>He said that American and Chinese thinkers should cooperate closely to counter Japan's malicious propaganda against China, according to Continental Daily. American missionary Dr. Smith of Los Angeles, California, and twenty-four American teachers passed through Shanghai last night (the 22nd) on the Chichibu Maru, heading to Hong Kong and Guangzhou. They will stay for a few days and then return to Shanghai, and then travel to Nanjing, Peiping, Manchuria, and other places to conduct inspections. Smith is a well-known advocate for peace and has extensively studied international affairs. He has traveled to Europe and the United States and has written seventeen books. He also writes articles for various newspapers in the United States and Canada. Smith believes that at a time when Japan is continuing its propaganda in the United States, American and Chinese thinkers should urgently engage in close cultural cooperation to counter Japan's malicious propaganda against China. This trip will certainly enable the members to better understand the current situation in China, and when they return home, they will tell their students what they have seen and heard. The benefits will not be small. Next week, another group led by Mr. Robertson, with a total of forty-five people, will pass through Shanghai on their way around the world.</p>

<p>The Coarse Grain Industry Petitions the Authorities</p>
<h3>To Stop Ordering Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Bountiful Rain Relieves Food Concerns, Foreign Rice Imports Endanger Rural Areas</p>
<p>Since the bean and rice industry proposed ordering 500,000 shi of foreign rice to prevent shortages and requested the government to exempt it from import duties, it has aroused serious attention from all parties. The Coarse Grain Industry Association of this city also believes that ordering foreign rice will affect the national economy, so it convened a temporary meeting yesterday and decided to petition the relevant authorities to strictly stop it. The following is a record:</p>
<h3>Temporary General Assembly</h3>
<p>The Coarse Grain Industry Association convened a temporary executive and supervisory committee meeting at its meeting hall in Lao Beimen yesterday at 1 pm to discuss the case of stopping the order of foreign rice. More than twenty people were in attendance, including Chen Shide, Chuan Changyu, Chen Yinsheng, Le Chenfu, Li Ziming, Qian Yunsheng, and Gu Jicheng. Le Chenfu was elected chairman. After reading the minutes of the previous meeting, they discussed (1) how to express their opinion on the recent uproar about ordering foreign rice, which is greatly affecting the national economy and harming rural areas. It was resolved to (1) petition the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Bureau of Social Affairs to forward the petition to the central government for strict prohibition, and (2) issue a circular telegram. The rest is omitted.</p>
<h3>Petition for Prohibition</h3>
<p>The association submitted a petition yesterday to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting the prohibition of ordering foreign rice, stating in the petition: "Regarding the bean and rice industry purchasing foreign rice, which destroys the rural economy and affects the national economy, we request that this matter be forwarded to the central government for strict prohibition." We believe that the recent rise in rice prices is due to a prolonged drought, obstruction of waterways, and unfavorable transportation, leading to a temporary shortage. Last year was a year of abundant harvests and ample storage, sufficient for self-sufficiency, and we have not reached a truly dangerous stage of rice shortage and famine. However, the bean and rice industry in this city rashly considers ordering foreign rice as a remedy, which is an exaggerated measure and contradicts the government's policy of increasing taxes to protect the rural economy. Moreover, evidence from major rice-producing areas such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui indicates that the situation is not as severe as reported. Furthermore, recently, abundant rainfall has occurred in various provinces, and even if there are differences in yields, an average of 70% or more can be expected. Even in Jiangsu province, which was relatively late in sowing, this rainfall has not been untimely. Even if there are occasional losses, they seem to be minor. Only the area south of the Qiantang River in Zhejiang, which is mostly mountainous, although relatively deficient, is not a rice-producing area and is not of major importance. Even considering the recent rice prices in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui, they are only selling for six yuan and a half to seven yuan per hectoliter in Shanghai. An investigation reveals that the grain price in the production area is only selling for two yuan and several jiao, which cannot be considered a high price. Moreover, foreign rice such as Xiaojiao and Saigon are also types of indica rice. Now that the price of indica rice is so low and the supply is so abundant, why order foreign rice again, unless to further lower its price and hasten the demise of the rural economy? How can this be consistent with the purpose of vigorously promoting rural relief? Therefore, our association generally believes that the rice industry's request for tax-free import of foreign rice has not considered the harm to farmers and the national economy due to cheap grain. Leaving aside the fact that relief is not yet timely, especially now that the early rice harvest is approaching and the people's food can be supplied, and the autumn late rice has received rainfall and there is hope for a harvest, there seems to be no need to rely on ordering foreign rice. Even if there are differences in harvests from year to year, it should be considered after the autumn harvest, and it would not be too late to make arrangements then. This is as far as our association's limited view can reach, and we dare not remain silent. Therefore, we have prepared this document based on the situation and respectfully request your review and approval, and earnestly request that it be forwarded to the central government for strict prohibition. This would be fortunate for all merchants and fortunate for the nation. Respectfully submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Wu Huanru Went to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>To attend the Executive Yuan's Drought Prevention Conference and Submit a Five-Point Opinion Paper, according to the Central News Agency: Since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been severely dry, with Jiang, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai being the most affected areas. In order to seek relief, the central government specifically summoned representatives from five provinces and cities to attend a temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan to discuss drought relief matters. Wu Huanru, Section Chief of the Second Section of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, was dispatched to Beijing on the 20th to attend the temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 21st to discuss drought relief matters. In addition to reporting in detail on the damage to crops and relief work in various rural areas of the city, Wu also participated in drought relief opinions. At that time, due to the need to investigate the actual situation of various issues, except for the principles that had already been determined, the specific methods were all left for discussion at the Executive Yuan's regular meeting this Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Opinions</h3>
<p>After attending the temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan, Wu returned to Shanghai by overnight train on the same day. After arriving in Shanghai, Wu reported the details of his attendance to Wu Xingya, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. Considering that the Executive Yuan will continue to discuss drought relief matters at the regular meeting on the 24th, he drafted specific opinions for the city on drought relief. After Director Wu finalized them, he took the opinion paper to Beijing last night to submit to the Executive Yuan's regular meeting for discussion.</p>
<h3>Divided into Five Points</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry, the content of the opinion paper is entirely based on the established principles and is divided into five points: (1) The central government will establish a Food Transportation and Sales Bureau, and transportation and sales agencies will also be established simultaneously in various places; (2) Rivers and canals will be dredged for farmland irrigation; (3) Merchants will be encouraged to establish agricultural warehouses and mortgages, etc.; (4) Farmers will be guided to organize purchasing and consumer cooperatives; (5) Farmers' sideline occupations will be promoted.</p>
<h3>The All-Zhejiang Public Association Elaborates on Drought Prevention Opinions</h3>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Public Association sent a telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, stating: "To the esteemed Zhejiang Provincial Government: We respectfully read your government's reply to our association's collective telegram, and we deeply appreciate your efforts in preventing disasters and protecting the people, as well as your solicitation of our opinions on disaster prevention matters in our hometown. We especially admire your humility and willingness to inquire about humble opinions. This kind and benevolent intention of a wise official is enough to welcome harmony and dispel epidemics. This year's weather is severely dry, with no rainfall for a long time. Planting in farmland has only reached 30-40% of the target. The planted seedlings are also gradually withering due to drought. Although Shanghai has recently seen light rain, it has been intermittent and the amount of rainfall is small. The drought situation has already formed and is unavoidable. Our association has repeatedly received disaster reports from various places, and the suggestions from the Haining County Drought Relief Association to dredge the Hongqiao Weir to allow water from the Mao River to enter, open the Jian Weir, and borrow a motor from the Hangzhou Power Plant to draw water from the Qiantang River and irrigate the inland rivers are the most critical. The government is already planning to draw water from the Qiantang River to irrigate farmland. The opening of the West Lake Jian Weir was handled by the Industry Department in the 13th year of the Republic (1924) and should be investigated and handled accordingly. As for the Hongqiao Weir, it is located more than 40 li northeast of Pinghu and borders Huating (now merged into Songjiang County) in Jiangsu province. It receives water from the Sanliu River and flows westward into the Jiuliu branch of Danghu, connecting six counties including the former Jiashu Haiyan. In times of drought, it brings the tide from Haipu into the inland rivers, and in times of flooding, it discharges torrents into the sea. Its impact on the water conservancy of the seven counties is significant. In the middle of the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, the late gentry Xu Yongfu of Haiyan raised funds to dredge it, and the people benefited greatly at that time. It has been more than 40 years since then, and it has been in disrepair for a long time. The riverbed has become silted up, preventing the water flow from being smooth. An investigation reveals that dredging the Mao River was funded by the late gentry Yao Fangmei of Jiaxing and Mr. Xu Yongfu, who jointly donated a large sum of money and deposited it for interest, in preparation for re-dredging after siltation. The principal and interest of the fund have now accumulated to more than 44,000 yuan and are managed by the local property committees of the three counties of Jiaxing, Haiyan, and Pinghu on a rotating basis. At this time of drought and water depletion, it is urgent to use this stored special fund to start the dredging work. Our association has sent letters to the property committees of the three counties of Jia, Hai, and Ping requesting them to convene a joint meeting to discuss the dredging. We implore your government to promptly order the county governments of the three counties to supervise and urge the local gentry to discuss and handle it as soon as possible. For the sections along the river where the riverbed is occupied by mulberry fields and reed beaches, and for the land that was originally for the people but is now an obstruction to the river, the dredging can be carried out separately after giving compensation. We also propose that your government order Pinghu and request the governments of Songjiang in Jiangsu province to assist in the process in order to smooth the water source and provide irrigation, which is of no small benefit to relieving farmland. In addition, our association member Shen Shanshou submitted three suggestions for drought prevention. In addition to the dredging of the Hongqiao Weir, which has been detailed above, one is to dredge the Linping Lake. The reason is that Linping Lake is connected to the official river, and the water is flat, which is as beneficial to paddy fields as West Lake. Now it has been abandoned as mulberry fields and fish ponds, and the remaining several hundred mu are also overgrown with reeds and cattails. During the great drought in the 17th year of Chongzhen (1644), Xu Bozheng proposed to dredge Linping Lake and use the method of dredging West Lake to build dams with the soil, as well as the Dongjiang Bridge and Hu Dao. However, due to the chaos of the world, it could not be implemented. We should follow the example of our predecessors and convene a meeting to carry it out. Another is to dredge West Lake. The reason is that the water conservancy of West Lake is related to farmland and is not only for sightseeing. The model of Su and Bai is still admirable. The deeper the lake, the more beneficial it is to the Hangzhou seawater and paddy fields; the shallower the water, the more harmful it is. Now, in the event of a severe drought, the lake water dries up first, and the residents along the lake have no way to store water, let alone others. Therefore, the dredging is especially important. The above two items are fundamental plans for water conservancy in Hangzhou and Haining counties and are in line with the fourth item of the drought prevention office's decision to prepare for the event, which should be discussed by the office together with the Hangzhou municipal and county governments and the Zhejiang Western Water Conservancy Conference</p>
<p>A meeting should be convened to allocate funds for construction, and West Lake should be permanently prohibited from filling in and buying lake land, so as to avoid competing with water for profit. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost. A permanent solution depends on human effort. Although it is an emergency measure, the benefits will last for generations. Therefore, we forward it for adoption. Moreover, our association has a request. The water flows northeast, such as the Grand Canal and the old lakes, all originate from Tianmu. The waters in the southern part of Jiaxing and Haiyan all rely on the mountains southwest of Haiyan. The ancient names Qinxi Pond and the valley water of Xiashi, its outlet water source, and all necessary water flows, must be dredged at the silted places. We also request that the county governments be ordered to consult with local gentry, conduct detailed surveys, and select the key areas to raise funds for dredging. The abandoned Lougang River Beach, which used to be an area for storing and draining water, is now occupied by civilian residences or mulberry fields. If there are traces of the old path, they must all be opened.</p>
<p>Far Eastern Company's Two Airplanes</p>
<h3>To Perform at Hongqiao Today</h3>
<p>The performance of crazy flying and combat skills by the Far Eastern Aircraft Company's Avro trainer and the Fairey Fox fighter-reconnaissance aircraft, originally scheduled for 5:00 PM last Saturday at the Hongqiao Airport, was temporarily postponed due to the approaching typhoon and the rain. The pilots and spectators were inconvenienced, so it was decided to notify all parties and temporarily suspend it. Now that the typhoon has passed and the weather has cleared, it has been decided to hold it at 5:45 PM today. The invitation cards issued last time are still valid today.</p>
<h3>Performance Program</h3>
<p>At 5:45 PM, Sir Hamilton, an instructor at the Hong Kong Far East Aviation School, will first fly the Avro trainer and demonstrate the latest British aviation training methods, followed by a crazy flying demonstration on the same aircraft, which is the first of its kind in our country. Finally, Captain Peng Naide, a pilot from the Far Eastern Company, will fly the Fairey Fox two-seater fighter-reconnaissance aircraft to demonstrate combat skills and showcase the aircraft's features. The Far Eastern Company has also printed beautiful program booklets to be distributed on site. Prominent figures from China and abroad, such as Finance Minister Kong, British Consul-General Bailey Nan, etc., will personally attend the event. Mayor Wu has also dispatched the city government band to perform and add to the excitement.</p>
<h3>Flying to Jiangxi the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>After the two aircraft perform in Shanghai, Zhou Guan San, the manager of the company, will accompany the two pilots to fly to Nanchang for a performance on Thursday or Friday of this week.</p>
<p>Dredging and repairing will allow the entire region's water system to be connected, providing water storage and drainage routes, so that both drought and flood can be prepared for without worry. As for the current emergency relief methods, it all depends on purchasing a large number of water pumps to draw water from the big rivers and irrigate the inland river tributaries, so as to facilitate farmland irrigation. However, because the disaster area is too large, the equipment needed in various places is being purchased from Shanghai, causing the Shanghai factories' inventory to be depleted and the prices to rise. It is also proposed to order all counties to allow farmers to temporarily borrow all the fire pumps in the county and various factories without any excuses, in order to supplement the lack of agricultural implements. Heaven has sent calamity and suffered this extraordinary drought. It is especially important for officials and the people to cooperate with all their strength, without distinction, to jointly defend against it. All non-urgent administrative affairs should be temporarily suspended, in order to concentrate talents and economy on the work of drought prevention and rice rescue. The countryside has long been on the verge of bankruptcy, and if this year's autumn harvest is hopeless, the consequences will be unimaginable. It is now heard that the Ministry of Industry is preparing 900,000 yuan for miscellaneous grain seeds to be distributed to the drought-stricken areas for replanting, in preparation for the shortage of food after the disaster, which is truly an essential plan for disaster relief. It seems appropriate to take advantage of the current summer growing season to quickly sow the seeds. If it is delayed until autumn, when the weather suddenly turns cold, it will not be easy for the late crops to bear fruit. It is recommended that your government consult with the Ministry of Industry to purchase and distribute them as soon as possible, and at the same time order the county magistrates to supervise the town and township offices to determine the actual number of unplanted and replanted fields, and report the village, household name, and mu number in detail, so that they can receive the seeds for replanting after they are issued, so as to avoid repeated investigations and delays. This matter concerns the people's food and should not be ignored, lest it delay the important task of disaster preparedness. The case has been submitted to the board of directors of our association for detailed discussion and unanimously passed. We hereby telegraphically submit it, and we respectfully request your government to review it, adopt it, and implement it. We cannot express our urgency enough. The Shanghai All-Zhejiang Public Association kowtows."</p>
<p>Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax</p>
<h3>Must Be Handled in Accordance with Ministry Regulations</h3>
<p>A person in charge of the Municipal Finance Bureau talks about the Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association's meeting yesterday, according to the Central News Agency: The person in charge of the Municipal Finance Bureau stated that the collection of tobacco and alcohol license tax must be handled in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Ministry and cannot be compromised in any way, lest it violate the central government's laws. The government's position is based on abiding by the law. The bureau cannot arbitrarily increase or decrease the regulations promulgated by the central government. If it is intentionally interpreted or compromised at will, then what can be decreased can also be increased, and the handling will lose its basis, and the malpractices will be unspeakable. The people of southern China are also part of the national people. If the local government deliberately increases or decreases the central government's laws, it should also rise up to correct it. How can there be people who, for the sake of personal interests, do not care about requiring handling that deviates from the regulations, and force the government to violate the law? Moreover, if the previous application for licenses was not entirely in accordance with the regulations, from a legal point of view, it was a false report and a tax evasion. After the bureau took over, at a minimum, it must be corrected in accordance with the regulations. Moreover, tobacco and alcohol are consumables containing narcotics (cigarettes are especially harmful and have become popular throughout the country in recent years, and even young children and coolies buy and smoke them). They are of great harm to the people's health, morality, economy, and social customs. Therefore, in the recent New Life Movement, drunkenness and smoking are included in the list of things to be eliminated. Since these bad items are enough to harm the people, the government has the responsibility to supervise and crack down on them. The method of crackdown is to impose heavy taxes or absolute prohibition (advanced countries have extremely strict crackdowns on the tobacco and alcohol industry, with some designating stores that sell tobacco and not allowing them to be set up in multiple locations, and others levying license taxes of more than 1,000 yuan on the wine industry). Moreover, tobacco and alcohol are only for those with hobbies to purchase and use, and are by no means necessary items in human life, and cannot be compared with ordinary items such as firewood, rice, salt, and oil. Therefore, the government's collection of license tax is actually an intention to supervise and crack down on them. Since merchants are engaged in the business of selling these items, they should be subject to the government's supervision and crackdown, and should comply with the regulations and fulfill their tax obligations. It has been reported in the newspapers in recent days that tobacco and alcohol merchants have requested to be considerate of the merchants' difficulties and not collect taxes in accordance with the Ministry's regulations, which is far from the principle of the government's collection of this tax. If they also object to the bureau's collection of taxes in accordance with the regulations, then the New Life Movement's elimination of drunkenness and smoking should not be promoted in terms of their own interests. It is said that this time the central government assigned the collection of tobacco and alcohol license tax to the local government to offset the abolition of miscellaneous taxes. The city has no miscellaneous taxes to abolish, so the tobacco and alcohol license tax seems to be an extra income. It is not known that this tax was previously stipulated in the Business Tax Law to be collected by the central government. After leaving 10%, the rest was allocated to the provinces and cities as local income, and the Ministry of Finance has allocated it on record. This tax is purely a kind of local income, and in recent years, the city's development requires a large amount of money. The bureau should reorganize the income and use it for municipal facilities, so that the citizens can enjoy it universally. As for the fact that the city has no miscellaneous taxes to abolish, it can be known that what has been collected has been fair taxes. Even the tobacco and alcohol license tax is a good tax. The city only needs to strictly implement it. If it is a miscellaneous tax, then it should not take a single dime.</p>
<p>The city's tobacco and alcohol trade association held a joint meeting at the Ningbo Road Tobacco Exchange Guild Hall yesterday afternoon. Yang Qiaosheng, Shen Guicheng, Liao Zhongwen, and Zheng Jingyun from the Fen Wine industry, Zhu Shirong, Zhu Ligong, and Cheng Kefan from the restaurant industry, Zhou Jinrong from the Shaoxing Wine industry, Chen Liangyu, Shen Deting, Zhang Songji, Qian Wenda, and Chen Kunxian from the tobacco exchange industry, and Chen Weiwen from the sauce garden industry, etc., more than 30 people, were present, with Chen Liangyu presiding and Zhang Jinzhi recording. After performing the rituals, the chairman reported on the situation of petitioning the Finance Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and entrusted Chairman Yu Zuoting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to properly assist. Then, the following motions were discussed: (1) The Finance Bureau has set a deadline of the end of July to pay the tobacco and alcohol business license tax in accordance with the regulations. The two industries' trade associations cannot increase the burden. How should this be handled? Please decide. It was decided that the issue of reducing the burden of the license tax will be resolved by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. At the same time, each trade association will notify its members to apply for registration in accordance with the original license level within the deadline. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>British-American New Factory</p>
<h3>Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>All Workers Will Be Able to Work Starting Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Labor Union Reported the Process to the Party and Government Organs</p>
<p>The Mayor Encouraged Labor and Management to Cooperate with Each Other</p>
<p>The British-American Tobacco Factory's Suspension of the Pudong Old Factory Case: After the party and government organs decided on a solution, the new factory workers resumed work yesterday in compliance with the order. The labor union reported the resumption of work process to the municipal government. The mayor encouraged labor and management to cooperate with each other. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resuming Work in Compliance with the Order: More than 4,100 workers and more than 100 Chinese staff members at the British-American Tobacco Factory's new factory accepted the advice of the party and government organs and uniformly entered the factory to resume work yesterday morning. However, because the work in each room of the factory is interconnected, only the workers in the engine and coppersmith rooms worked yesterday, and most of the workers did not have work. It is estimated that all workers will be able to fully work starting today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>End of the Strike: The strike committee, women's team, maintenance team, and propaganda team organized during the strike have all ended since the previous day. The support association of all sectors to assist the British-American Tobacco Factory's workers will also be revoked on a regular basis. All old factory workers' wages have been scheduled by the factory to be delivered to the party and government organs for distribution this week. As for the new factory workers resuming work, such as the packing department, there is no work to do because there is no inventory.</p>
<p>Monitoring and Protection: Yesterday morning, the Social Affairs Bureau specifically dispatched Zhu Guilin to inspect the situation together with representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau. The Fifth District Cigarette Labor Union also sent Standing Committee members Chen Peide, Lou Jingguan, and Liu Dehua to the new factory to monitor the resumption of work. The Third District Office of the Public Security Bureau also sent many police officers to protect the workers entering the factory to resume work in the vicinity of the new factory.</p>
<p>Mayor's Remarks: Regarding the resolution of the British-American Tobacco Factory labor dispute, Mayor Wu made the following remarks yesterday: Regarding the British-American Tobacco Company's announcement of the suspension of the No. 1 Old Factory in Pudong, a labor dispute occurred. The dispute has been brewing for two months. The old factory has more than 2,000 workers. They suddenly felt unemployed, and their suffering is worthy of deep thought. However, because both sides insisted, the resolution was delayed. However, the prolonged suspension of this case not only concerns the livelihood of the workers but also affects social stability. Therefore, the municipal government has repeatedly adhered to the central government, consulted with the party headquarters and other related parties, and made every effort to mediate. Fortunately, the factory was able to understand the overall situation, respect Chinese government laws and regulations, and the workers were able to take the overall situation into consideration and accept the advice. Therefore, five solutions were decided on the previous day and ordered to be followed. The new factory workers resumed work yesterday, and the labor dispute that had been brewing for months was resolved. I deeply hope that both labor and management will embrace understanding and mutual benefit in the future, and not indulge in petty resentments or rely on emotions, so as to avoid disputes, which will cause unnecessary losses and leave hidden dangers to society.</p>
<p>Issuance of Retirement Pay: The British-American Old Factory is allowed to close, and all workers will be given three months' retirement pay. The British-American Company notified all workers yesterday of the following dates for receiving retirement pay and savings: From 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM this Thursday, all male workers will be paid. From 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM this Friday, all female workers will be paid. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM this Saturday, all staff members and foremen will be paid retirement pay.</p>
<p>Cai Wuji</p>
<h3>Denies Miao Zhongxiu's Transfer to Hankou</h3>
<p>Cai Wuji, Director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, and others went to Qingdao to attend the Commodity Inspection Technology Conference. After completing their tasks, they have returned to Shanghai. The details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, it was mentioned that Miao Zhongxiu, Director of the Raw Silk Inspection Department of the bureau, had been transferred to the Hankou bureau. Upon hearing this, the parties concerned inquired with the bureau. Director Cai firmly denied this, saying that the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau has never had a raw silk inspection department. Moreover, Miao Zhongxiu, Director of the Raw Silk Inspection Department of the bureau, has been relied on heavily since taking office. The rumor of his transfer to Hankou is absolutely untrue.</p>
<h3>The Liangjiang Steamer Had an Accident on the Upper River</h3>
<p>Qichun Ran Aground at Shizhuangzi, Passengers Safe; Minzu Ran Aground at Tiaoguan, Ship Body Still Intact</p>
<p>Qichun Ran Aground: The Qichun, a passenger liner of the Jiejiang Company's Shanghai-Chongqing line, with a load of 300 tons, departed from Shanghai on the 11th of this month with cargo and passengers bound for Chongqing. At 10:00 AM on the previous morning (the 22nd), it arrived at Shizhuangzi, 130 li upstream of Yichang and 30 li near Wanxian. The current was very rapid there, making navigation difficult. Due to careless driving, it ran aground. Fortunately, the ship was stranded on the reef, so although the bottom of the ship was holed, it did not sink. The shipowner immediately telegraphed the Shanghai office for a report. The company has now dispatched an iron barge and the Yi'an steamer to the scene of the accident to rescue. The first two cabins were flooded and the cargo was soaked. The passengers are safe. After the barge and Yi'an arrive, the cargo in the cabin will be transferred first, and then the hole will be temporarily repaired with cement before returning to Shanghai for repairs.</p>
<p>Minzu Ran Aground: The Minzu, a passenger liner of the Minsheng Company's Shanghai-Yichang line, departed from Shanghai at the beginning of this month with cargo and passengers bound for Yichang. On the 8th, it passed Tiaoguan, more than 100 li upstream of Hankou and away from Shashi. At that place, the river water rose sharply, destroying the embankment and rushing to the shore, making the navigation line difficult to identify. The ship ran aground on the embankment. Fortunately, it was a sandy area, so although the ship was stranded, it was not damaged. The company has sent mechanics to try to tow it out. Yesterday, the company said that the river water has receded in recent days, and the ship is stranded on the beach. If the river water can rise by three or four feet, it can get out of danger.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Government Replies to Zhang Weicheng, etc.</p>
<h3>There Are Already Solutions for Drought Relief in Southern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Shanghai Western Gentry Zhang Weicheng, Gu Wenwei, Zhang Guozhen, etc., previously telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating that due to the severe drought, they requested that the collection of various industrial and construction surtaxes in the counties be retained locally and used for disaster prevention first. It is now heard that the provincial government has replied to Zhang Weicheng, etc., stating that the southern Jiangsu counties are suffering from drought, and the farmland has no water for irrigation, so it is imperative to seek relief. The government has made overall plans and formulated a general outline for the drought relief measures in the counties, ordering the counties to follow them, and has formulated methods for drawing water from rivers and lakes for drought relief and detailed rules for implementation, with staff members sent by the Construction Department to rush to handle them in different areas.</p>

<p>Second Special Court Continues Trial</p>
<h3>顏魯卿 Extortion and Intimidation Case</h3>
<p>Extortion and Intimidation Cases Combined for Trial, Witnesses Testify on the 60,000 Yuan Intimidation | Trial Concluded Yesterday, Sentencing Scheduled for the Morning of the 23rd |</p>
<p>The suspects in the robbery case at the Xue Mai Luo Law Firm on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, including Zhu Zhang Zuming of Ruichangshun Hardware Store, Zhuang Jimin, the major shareholder of Zhuang Yuanda, Wang Lianyou, a hardware salesman, and Tang Qingyue, director of Dade Hospital, are being tried in the Second District Court. It was discovered that Yan Luqing, the plaintiff's representative lawyer, was suspected of extorting 2,000 yuan from the family of Tang Qingyue. The French Concession Police Department's Police Division filed a public lawsuit against Yan Luqing in the Second Special Court. Following the conclusion of the debate as instructed, the sentencing was scheduled for the 23rd, as reported in previous news. It is now known that the day before yesterday, Zhang Zuyin, the principal of Ruichangshun, namely Zhang Zuming's brother, and Zhang Yuquan, the father-in-law of Zhuang Jimin, the major shareholder of Zhuang Yuanda,</p>
<h3>Went to the French Concession Police Department</h3>
<p>and reported that lawyer Yan Luqing, accompanied by Zhou Jinggeng, a comprador from the Xue Mai Luo Law Firm, came to the merchants on June 18th, demanding 60,000 yuan for private settlement of losses and requested submission, etc. Thereupon, the police department summoned all the witnesses for questioning. Yesterday morning, all the witnesses were brought to the Second Special Court. Judge Xiong Huiping, accompanied by Secretary Tao, ascended to the first criminal court and, after completing the interrogation of the trivial case, at 11 o'clock, regarding the Yan case, Judge Xiong instructed that the public lawsuit against Yan Luqing filed by Tang Qingyue was originally scheduled for sentencing today, but due to the accusations by Zhang Zuyin, Zhang Yuquan, and others, the concluded debate should be revoked and reopened,</p>
<h3>Consolidated Trial</h3>
<p>After the instruction, Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the police department, recounted the previous events. The judge asked Yan, "Did you demand 60,000 yuan from them?" Yan replied, "On June 18th, I met Zhao Zhongdi in the police department's writing room. He said he came to bail Zhang Zuming, but because Zhang had already confessed to being a thief, the police department did not want him to bail him. According to the police department, he was also detained for a night. He also said that Zhang and Zhuang were definitely not thieves, and he was extremely surprised by the confession of being a thief. He asked us to go and see if their two shops were big," etc. Then Zhao left first, and I and Zhou Jinggeng also went out. We saw Zhao waiting next to our car. Zhao said he wanted to go to Zhuang Yuanda and invited us to go with him. So we went together, and</p>
<h3>Arrived at Ruichangshun</h3>
<p>at our destination. Zhao got out of the car first. He said he wanted to go in to make a phone call and asked us to wait inside. I said it was inconvenient. Zhao said, "With me here, it's okay." So we unintentionally followed him in. Zhao immediately said to the shop assistants, "They are the victim and the representative lawyer." The shop assistants asked Zhou about the robbery. After a short while, Zhang Zuyin came to the shop, and they exchanged names. But at that time, I didn't say a word. Afterwards, Zhao led us to Zhuang Yuanda to take a look. When we arrived there, Zhao got out of the car first and went inside. We were still watching outside. Then Zhang Yuquan came out to greet us and invited us in. However, I recognized Zhang Yuquan. At that time, he said that Jimin</p>
<h3>Was His Son-in-Law</h3>
<p>He also said that Zhang Zuming and Zhuang Jimin were relatives. Why did Zhang accuse Zhuang of being a thief? He also asked Zhou how much he had lost. I replied about the robbery. At this point, the judge ordered each witness to step forward, inquired about their names and places of origin, and then instructed them to be questioned separately. First, he questioned Zhou Jinggeng on how he met Zhao Zhongdi and how he went to the Zhang and Zhuang families. Zhou's answer was the same as Yan's. The judge ordered Zhao Zhongdi to be brought in. He asked, "How did you go to the police department?" He replied, "I went to the police department to prove that Zhang Zuming was definitely not a thief and wanted to bail him out." He asked, "Do you know Yan and Zhou?" He replied, "I didn't know them before. I met them at the police department. I told them that Zhang Zuming</p>
<h3>Was Definitely Not a Thief</h3>
<p>Besides, their shop is very big." He asked, "Did you accompany them to Ruichangshun and Zhuang Yuanda?" He replied, "Yes. I came out of the police department, and Yan and Zhou followed me out. They asked me where I was going. I said I was going to Broadway. They said they had a car and invited me to go with them. In the car, they told me that the losses from the robbery last year and this year totaled 60,000 yuan. They also said that it was okay if the Jiangbei people robbed them, but if they were robbed by the young masters, they would have to settle this account with them. They also said, 'Please help us, Mr. Zhao.' I said, 'Okay.'" He asked, "Who said this?" He replied, "Yan and Zhou said it together. When we first arrived at Ruichangshun, I went in to make a phone call first. On the one hand, Zhang Zuyin talked with Yan and others. I only heard</p>
<h3>About 60,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>And 10,000 yuan. Then they started arguing. I didn't hear clearly what they were saying. In the end, I heard Zhang Zuyin say that if Zuming was a thief, he should be dealt with. Yan and others then separated and went outside. Later, they asked me to accompany them to Zhuang Yuanda. When we arrived there, they talked, but I didn't hear. I only heard Zhang Yuquan say that he hadn't met his son-in-law and didn't know the situation, so he couldn't answer. Therefore, we separated and went outside." The judge asked Yan Luqing, "Did you tell them in the car about the losses from the robbery?" Yan replied, "Zhou and I sat in the front, and Zhao and Zhou's nephew, Zhou Jushun, sat in the back. I only saw Zhao dozing off in the car and didn't say anything." He also questioned Zhang Zuyin, who stated, "On the morning of June 18th, I went to the Hongkou Police Department for my brother's matter to</p>
<h3>Investigate the Facts</h3>
<p>When I returned to the shop, I saw that Yan and others had arrived before me. I exchanged business cards with them first. I asked them why they had come. They said that your brother was a thief, and it was a settled case. They said that they had come today to save your face and reduce your brother's mental suffering, so it would be better to settle it privately. I asked how to settle it privately. They said that the robberies totaled more than 20,000 yuan. If you paid 60,000 yuan, it could be settled. I said that the police department had filed a public lawsuit, so how could it be settled privately? He said, 'Don't worry about it. If you can pay, it can be settled.' I also said that I didn't have such a large sum of money. They also said that if the two families each paid 30,000 yuan, it wouldn't be too much. I said that I hadn't met my brother and didn't know the situation. If</p>
<h3>He Really Was a Thief</h3>
<p>And the police department didn't handle it, I would handle it myself. I would never buy a reputation as a thief with money. They also said that a smaller amount would be okay. I said that even if the Zhuang family paid 55,000 yuan, we wouldn't pay 5,000 yuan. But they kept pestering me. I told them to leave. When they were about to leave, they said that if I didn't take out 60,000 yuan, I wouldn't be able to open my shop. At that time, Zhao Zhongdi said to me, 'How much can you pay? Give them that much.' I replied that I wouldn't pay a penny and told him to refuse them." At this point, the judge ordered Zhao Zhongdi to be brought in and asked, "Did you tell Zhang how much he could pay them?" Zhao replied, "I didn't say that." The judge said to Zhang and others, "Why are your answers inconsistent?" He also questioned Zhang Yuquan, who stated, "On June 18th, at about 8 o'clock, I received a phone call saying that my son-in-law, Zhuang Jimin,</p>
<h3>Was Suspected of Being a Thief</h3>
<p>I went to Zhuang Yuanda to investigate. When I arrived at 10 o'clock, someone said that someone was negotiating at Ruichangshun, demanding 60,000 yuan. After a while, they came to my place. When I went downstairs, I saw Lawyer Yan, whom I had met before at the Shanghai Cemetery. I asked him what was going on. He said that Jimin was a thief. I said that Jimin was my son-in-law and told him to be careful in handling things. At that time, Zhou Jinggeng said that 60,000 yuan would settle the matter. I asked how 60,000 yuan was needed. He said that it was for the robbery last year and this year, plus interest losses, the cost of exchanging new banknotes for old banknotes, entertainment expenses, and staking fees. I said that I was a businessman and he was a lawyer. Civil matters could be settled, but what about criminal matters?</p>
<h3>How Could It Be Settled?</h3>
<p>Yan replied that he could find a way. I said that if my son-in-law was a thief, I could also handle him. If he was talking about paying money, there was no need to talk about it. At this point, they left unhappily. Afterwards, they called twice more, but I didn't give them a satisfactory answer." The judge asked Yan, "Did that happen?" Yan replied that it did. He said that what they were saying was completely false and inconsistent, and that they were fabricating facts to make him a scapegoat. "How could there be such a stupid person in the world who would extort money from their 70 or 80 shop assistants? If there were facts, they could have reported it to the police long ago. It can be seen that it was just ordinary conversation. No one can believe this. Besides, I</p>
<h3>Am a Lawyer</h3>
<p>How could I settle a public lawsuit? Even if they paid me 60,000 yuan, how could I settle this public lawsuit?" As for Zhang Yuquan, he said last time that he was a classmate of mine at St. John's University and a fellow member of the Brahma King Ferry Club. Today, he said that he met me at the Shanghai Cemetery. From this point of view, it is clear that his words are inconsistent. But I went to Ruichangshun and Zhuang Yuanda with Zhao out of curiosity and due to the environment. Please declare me innocent." Wang Shizong and Zhang Shanle, two lawyers, also argued on his behalf. Judge Xiong instructed that the debate was concluded and that the sentencing was scheduled for 11 a.m. on the 28th of this month. The interrogation ended at 5 o'clock.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Rickshaw Committee</p>
<h3>Meets with Rickshaw Owner Representatives</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of July 23rd, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Committee, through the introduction of Mr. Yu Qiaqing, met with the representatives of the Rickshaw Owners' Association, Mr. Gu Songmao, Mr. Yin Zhiling, and Mr. Hou Shaoan, as well as Mr. Su Chun, the director of the Jianghuai Guild Hall. The committee discussed several points of the new regulations for rickshaw licensing. The rickshaw owners presented various reasons why they considered it difficult and requested that the implementation of the new regulations be delayed. However, the committee believed that the announcement of this matter had been made not long ago, and that the so-called difficult situation had arisen solely because of the delay and obstruction of some rickshaw owners. Furthermore, the committee had already, at the request of the Rickshaw Owners' Association, extended the deadline for applying for rickshaw owner certificates from July 21st to July 30th (the application schedule had been announced in early June). Therefore, rickshaw owners still have the opportunity to comply with the regulations and establish their own status so that they can obtain licenses for August. Mr. Cheng's participation in this meeting was due to the fact that many rickshaw pullers came from that area, and he sincerely hoped to improve their situation. The biggest goal of the Municipal Council's reforms was to improve the lives of rickshaw pullers. Therefore, Mr. Cheng expressed his admiration for the Council's efforts.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Actively</p>
<h3>Preparing for the Establishment of a Maritime Court</h3>
<p>Inspection of Foreign Vessels and Recovery of Navigation Rights Also Underway</p>
<p>Regarding the preparation for the establishment of a maritime court by the Ministry of Communications and the inspection of marine vessels, etc., a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Peng Hu, director of the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, yesterday. Secretary Chen Baoxian received the reporter on behalf of the director. According to the conversation, the following is the situation:</p>
<h3>Maritime Court</h3>
<p>According to the conversation, water transportation is becoming increasingly developed, and ship collision disputes are also increasing. The Navigation Administration Bureau has established a Ship Collision Dispute Handling Committee to mediate such disputes. Since its establishment, it has held 15 meetings. However, the Ministry of Communications believes that ship collision disputes are different from various land disputes. Therefore, at the last Conference on Promoting Shipping Affairs convened by the Ministry of Communications in Beijing, it was resolved to prepare for the establishment of a maritime court to handle ship collision disputes exclusively. However, because this matter involves judicial administration, the Ministry of Communications submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to ask the Legislative Yuan to draft organizational laws and regulations for the maritime court. Therefore, the organization of the maritime court can only proceed after the Legislative Yuan has completed the drafting of the laws and regulations.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Foreign Vessels</h3>
<p>The negotiation on the inspection of foreign vessels was handled by the Navigation Administration Bureau under the previous director. Because this negotiation concerns diplomacy, it is now directly managed by the Ministry of Communications. Currently, several foreign vessels have been inspected by the Navigation Administration Bureau, such as Asia Oil Tankers. However, larger vessels have not yet been inspected by us. The Ministry of Communications believes that the inspection of foreign vessels is of great importance to our country's sovereignty, so it has been proceeding separately in order to resolve it as soon as possible. Since the national vessels have been inspected by the Navigation Administration Bureau, the results have been very good, as the inspection of vessels is very important for navigation safety.</p>
<h3>Recovery of Navigation Rights</h3>
<p>As for the issue of recovering inland river navigation rights, shipping merchants in various places have appealed to the Ministry of Communications. The Ministry of Communications also believes that the recovery of inland river navigation rights is of great importance to national sovereignty. However, this negotiation cannot be achieved by empty words. At the last Conference on Shipping Affairs convened by the Ministry of Communications in Beijing, this issue was discussed, and it was resolved that the Ministry of Communications would handle it. The Bureau is currently unaware of the progress of the matter. In short, this issue is of great importance to the development of shipping operations by the Chinese people, and the Ministry of Communications is determined to actively pursue it.</p>
<h3>A Trip to Qingyang Port</h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau Hosts Newspaper Reporters on a Tour of the Railway Garden Hotel, a Summer Resort. The Qingyang Port Railway Garden Hotel, which opened just two months ago, has attracted many Chinese and foreign people who have heard of it and come to escape the summer heat. It can be called a summer resort. Huang Boqiao, director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, specially invited members of the Shanghai Daily Press Association and reporters from various newspapers to visit the hotel on the 22nd (the day before yesterday) and sent staff to host the tour. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Departure from North Station</h3>
<p>Reporters from various newspapers gathered in the first and second class passenger waiting room at the North Station at 8:45 a.m. Those present included Zhao Shuyong, Ma Yinliang, Qian Bohan, Qian Hua, Xu Xinyi, Wu Zhiping, Wang Weizhen, Wang Jilu, Zou Xinxiang, Wu Bingzhang, Xiong Shaohao, Xiang Yuancun, Ding Xiasheng, Qian Cangshuo, Yuan Yeyu, Wu Shirong, Zhao Muru, Yan Jiabao, Song Peisui, and more than 20 others. They were greeted at the station by Chen Guoliang, the general stationmaster of the North Station. The Railway Bureau specially prepared a first-class carriage, attached to the Beijing-Shanghai Express train, and departed at 9:00 a.m. Director Huang Boqiao, due to his impending trip abroad, was busy preparing his luggage and specially commissioned Fan Shouchi, secretary of the Bureau, to represent him and accompany the group, along with Chen Youshen, deputy section chief of the Suzhou-Songjiang Section, and Chen Rushan, manager of the Railway Garden Hotel, who provided attentive hospitality. At about 10:00 a.m., they arrived at Qingyang Port Station. After getting off the train, they walked dozens of steps north and reached the Railway Garden Hotel.</p>
<h3>Every Place is Secluded and Beautiful</h3>
<p>The hotel faces Qingyang Port, where the water is clear and a good place to swim. Foreigners living in Shanghai often gather here for boat races on fine autumn days. In summer, there are also many people who swim and go boating. After the reporters entered the Railway Garden Hotel, they immediately felt that every place was secluded and beautiful. The garden was covered with fine grass, and the trees provided shade. The newly built houses in the hostel were arranged in a novel and elegant manner, and the prices were very low. After the reporters finished visiting, they had lunch at the hotel. The dishes were especially delicious.</p>
<h3>Enjoyable Tour and Return</h3>
<p>After a short rest after the meal, at about 2:00 p.m., they took a small steamship specially prepared by the Railway Bureau for a tour along the port. Leaning on the railing and looking into the distance, the clear channel was vast. Although it was drizzling, it was incomparably cool. At about 3:00 p.m., they sailed to Kunshan and disembarked. After enjoying the famous scenic spots such as the park and Ma'anshan, they took a car back at about 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Japanese National Masuko Seishiro</p>
<h3>Suicide After Business Failure</h3>
<p>Slit His Throat with a Razor but Not Killed</p>
<p>But the Injuries Were Very Dangerous</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily reported that Masuko Seishiro, a Japanese national from Chiba Prefecture, 52 years old, residing at the home of his friend Nambu Yukijiro at 1085 North Sichuan Road, suddenly slit his throat with a razor at 8:00 a.m. on the 22nd. It was found that Masuko was originally an old Shanghai resident who had lived in China for 40 years, engaged in trade, and had considerable influence in French Indochina, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanhua, and other places. Later, his business repeatedly failed. In recent years, he also suffered from mental illness, and his life became increasingly difficult. He even had no home to live in, so he stayed at his friend's house. Recalling his past situation, he could not bear to imagine it, so he had thoughts of ending his life. Fortunately, he was discovered early and immediately sent to Fumin Hospital for emergency surgery. However, because the jugular vein in his neck had been cut very deeply, it was quite dangerous. On the same day, the police from the Japanese Consulate General picked up a letter to Nambu in his residence, asking Nambu to notify his brother after his death to avoid being harmed. He also said that this suicide was because he had been in adversity and had only obtained meager material possessions. He was no longer able to move around, and he felt both mentally and materially painful. He had no joy in living.</p>
<p>National Aviation Propaganda Team</p>
<h3>Departs for Zhejiang After Propaganda in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Plans to Travel Around the Country in Two and a Half Years. Chen Zhenglong, a Northeast Anti-Japanese Martyr of the September 18th Incident, and others formed the National Promotion of Aviation to Save the Country Walking Propaganda Team, which will depart for Zhejiang on a regular basis. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Organization Process</h3>
<p>Chen Zhenglong, the head of the team, was the head of the Independent Brigade of the Former Enemy Headquarters of the Northeast National Salvation Army. After the signing of the Tanggu Truce, his ambitions were difficult to achieve, so he gathered his comrades from Hunan, Huang Biyuan, Zhong Qingleng, Peng Jinghun, Gao Yun, Gu Siyi, Yang Xinhua, Fan Zhongyong, Fan Shouzhi, Ding Renjie, Li Yiran, etc., and went to Beijing. On May 1st, they prepared the Aviation to Save the Country Propaganda Team in Beijing, and it was approved by the Central Government in June.</p>
<h3>Planned Itinerary</h3>
<p>The team's itinerary is the Beijing-Shanghai Road, from Beijing to Shanghai, and from Shanghai along the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to Hangzhou, through the entire province of Zhejiang to Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Tibet, Mongolia, Suiyuan, Chahar, Hebei, Shandong, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Sichuan, then down the Yangtze River to Beijing. The county is the unit, and propaganda is carried out in rural areas as well.</p>
<h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to Chen Zhenglong, the head of the team, told a reporter from the New Sound News Agency that after we returned from the Northeast, we realized that the failure of the National Army was purely because it could not resist airplanes, which led to slaughter. Therefore, to save the country, we must engage in the construction of aviation in order to alleviate the national crisis. Therefore, we gathered our comrades and initiated the organization of the walking propaganda team, hoping to awaken our compatriots and strive to become stronger. All expenses are borne by ourselves, and no donations are collected along the way.</p>
<h3>Key Points of Propaganda</h3>
<p>(1) The course of the Northeast War; (2) The reasons for the failure; (3) The relationship between the Air Force and national defense. The itinerary of this trip around the country is scheduled for two and a half years, from June of this year to the end of the 25th year, and will be extended if necessary. The length of time will also depend on whether the people in various places can truly understand and realize it. At least the goal is to make the people donate money to the government to expand air defense.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Departure for Zhejiang</h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, under the guidance of the Municipal Party Department, propaganda was carried out in the People's Education Center, Small World, Republican Theatre, Fuan Amusement Park, etc. We are currently requesting the Aviation Association to discuss and coordinate propaganda in the concessions. Head Chen also said that after the team posted slogans at Small World, all the slogans had been torn down the next day. We are very saddened by this. At first, we thought that the people in the city were more aware of the national crisis and patriotic ideas than those in the countryside, but it was completely wrong, which is truly perplexing. The team has now specially requested the Municipal Party Department to find a way to correct this. Once the propaganda in the concessions is completed, we will immediately depart for Zhejiang, so we will need to stay in Shanghai for another week or two.</p>
<h3>Propaganda Slogans</h3>
<p>In addition to the "Declaration to Compatriots" (which has been reported in the newspapers), the team's written propaganda materials include the following slogans: (1) Follow the instructions of the Prime Minister and promote aviation to save the country; (2) Assist the government to realize the plan of aviation to save the country; (3) Promoting the aviation industry is the precursor to the revival of the Chinese nation; (4) Compatriots throughout the country should unanimously implement the policy of aviation to save the country; (5) Let us unite together to promote aviation to save the country; (6) Promoting the aviation industry is a good policy to resist imperialism; (7) Expanding the strength of the air force is the most important task in national defense; (8) Developing civil aviation is the greatest construction in transportation.</p>
<p>Xiang Huaqing Secretly Co-Habitates with a Widow</p>
<h3>Old Wife Searched and Was Beaten</h3>
<p>Xiang is Approaching 60 but His Sexual Desire Has Not Decreased, His Old Wife Files a Lawsuit After Being Humiliated. Xiang Huaqing, from Taicang, is approaching 60 and lives at 27 Sande Lane, Maibaik Road. He works at Yida Cotton Yarn Company. His wife, Zhang, is also 56 years old. They have been married for more than 30 years and have a son who is also more than 30 years old. The family is still harmonious. However, although Xiang is old, his sexual desire has not decreased slightly. Recently, he has secretly cohabitated with Gu He, a widow (28 years old) from Shaoxing who lives at 47 Weixin Lane, Jiangyuan Lane, Xinzha Road. Xiang often went to Gu He's house, always making an excuse and telling Xiang Zhang that he could not return home due to something. At first, Zhang did not doubt it, but because Xiang became accustomed to it, she secretly investigated. Xiang's secret was completely revealed. On the 14th of this month, Xiang again made an excuse to go out and did not return. Zhang went to Gu He's house at 5:30 a.m. on the 15th to search for him. Due to disagreements, an argument arose. Gu He's mother, Gu Tang, came out to help her daughter and beat Xiang Zhang severely, causing her to be seriously injured. Xiang Huaqing also took the opportunity to escape. Zhang then went to the Xinzha Police Department to report the incident. Detective Ma Derong and others were ordered to investigate and brought Gu He and Gu Tang back to the police department. Zhang was also sent to Baolong Hospital for examination, and it was confirmed that she had been injured. Because the case was a minor injury and the Gu family had a correct address, they were not detained and were released. A request was made to the First Special Court to issue a subpoena, and Gu He and Gu Tang were summoned to the Criminal Second Court yesterday morning. Attorney Jiang Baolian from the police department explained the case and filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 293 of the Criminal Law. He also said that Gu He did not deny cohabitating with Xiang Huaqing at the police station and was very frank. She admitted that she had grabbed the plaintiff's hand and her mother had done the beating. Zhang Xiang then testified about the beating and questioned Gu He. Gu He replied that Xiang Huaqing was a friend of my husband and sometimes came to my house. After my husband died, he rarely came. On the 14th, he came to play mahjong and only returned at dawn. There was nothing improper. She also denied the beating and hired lawyers Wu Linkun and Wang Zhonghuan to defend her, saying that there was someone behind the scenes in this case and asked for it to be verified. Judge Zhou Chengjin ordered the case to be adjourned for further investigation and ordered the plaintiff to go to the forensic doctor to examine her injuries.</p>
<p>Fight with Robbers During Arrest on Avenue Eugène Pottier This Morning</p>
<p>Robbers Escape Through the Net, One Person Injured. A robbery occurred near Avenue Eugène Pottier and Rue Hellert at approximately 1:00 a.m. this morning. When the robbers were leaving with their loot, the victim followed behind and shouted "Robbers!" The nearby police officers heard the alarm and rushed to pursue them. The robbers desperately ran away. The Jiaxing Road Police Department also received the news and quickly dispatched a large number of detectives to round them up. In a state of desperation, the robbers turned around and resisted arrest. The detectives also returned fire, and a fierce battle ensued. Bullets flew in all directions, and the sound was like a string of pearls. In the end, due to the darkness, the robbers were able to escape. However, during the fight between the detectives and the robbers, there were more than a dozen residents and pedestrians sleeping on the sidewalk in the area. As a result, two men were injured by stray bullets. Afterwards, an ambulance was dispatched to rush them to the Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>The Matter of the Stone Coffin is Untrue</p>
<h3>A Field Visit to Minhang Town</h3>
<p>A Corpse of a Tiny Person Less Than Three Inches Long Was Found in the Riverbank, Likely Due to Abnormal Physiology, Dispelling Rumors:</p>
<p>A report in this newspaper the other day stated that in the Xingtaowu area north of Minhang, a farmer named Jiang A'gen's son, Genfu, was cutting grass near the Longyin Temple when he saw two tiny people leap out from a nearby stone enclosure. One was five inches tall, and the other was three inches tall. Genfu tried to catch them, but the five-inch one escaped, while the three-inch one was accidentally trampled to death. Since the news was published, rumors have spread, with people exclaiming in astonishment. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency personally went to Minhang yesterday to investigate and learned that the matter was completely different from what was rumored. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>The Matter Has a Cause</h3>
<p>The report stated that the tiny people were discovered near the Longyin Temple in the Xingtaowu area north of Minhang Town. Therefore, after the reporter arrived at the North Bridge by car, he asked the local villagers whether there was a place called Xingtaowu and whether they had heard about the stone enclosure with tiny people. The villagers there were completely unaware of what he was talking about. They said they did not know where Xingtaowu was, and they had not heard anything about the stone enclosure with tiny people, even though they were so close to Minhang. Therefore, they believed the report was unreliable. When the reporter asked if there was a life release organization in Minhang Town, they shook their heads and said there was absolutely no such organization in Minhang. Hearing this, the reporter was greatly disappointed. He thought that since the incident occurred in Minhang, he must investigate in Minhang to find out the truth. Therefore, he drove to Minhang Town and asked the staff at the Shanghai-Minhang long-distance bus station. According to the staff's reply, the matter did have a cause, but there was no evidence to support it.</p>
<h3>Conflicting Stories</h3>
<p>When the reporter asked the staff about the matter, the staff knew that the reporter must be asking about the stone enclosure with tiny people. He said, "Your trip here can be considered a waste of time. There is no such thing as a stone enclosure with tiny people at all. The so-called tiny person is actually someone's illegitimate child. The claim of three inches is completely unreliable. There is no life release organization here, but there is a life-saving organization in the Dongpu Riverbank area east of the town. The so-called stone enclosure with tiny person occurred there. If you want to understand the details, you can go there and ask." After the staff finished speaking, the reporter nodded and thanked him. However, a villager sitting nearby insisted that the stone enclosure with tiny person was true and said that his neighbor had personally seen it. These two conflicting accounts made the reporter feel even more confused. Even in Minhang Town, where the incident occurred, there were conflicting stories, let alone in Shanghai, which is tens of miles away.</p>
<h3>On-Site Investigation</h3>
<p>Since the reporter had obtained a lead about the life-saving organization, he immediately followed the instructions and went there. The organization was located east of Minhang Town, and the car could not go directly there. The reporter got out of the car and walked for about half a mile before arriving at the place. The so-called life-saving organization had actually ceased operations. Although it was a life-saving organization several years ago, it is now a residential building. Therefore, there was no sign in front of the door. The organization was located east of the First Branch of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, north of the Minhang Hospital, and in front of the Huangpu River. It was located on the riverbank, and the air was quite good. When the reporter arrived, a woman and a child were standing in front of the door. The reporter immediately asked, based on the report, whether there was a Mr. Shen Shanshan there. The woman nodded in response and immediately took a card to inform him and asked the reporter to sit down for a while.</p>
<h3>An Incident Two Weeks Ago</h3>
<p>After a while, Mr. Shen Shanshan came out to meet him. The reporter asked him about the report. Mr. Shen said that the report was somewhat true and somewhat false. The so-called tiny person was true, but the claim that it leaped out from a stone enclosure was completely fabricated. About two weeks ago, Jiang A'gen's son, Genfu, who lives next door, was strolling along the Huangpu Riverbank when he suddenly saw something floating on the water. Upon closer inspection, it was the corpse of a child less than three inches long. It had all the features of a human: eyes, ears, mouth, and nose. He found it strange and picked it up. I learned about it and immediately made arrangements to preserve it because this kind of child corpse was so small that it was unprecedented. Even if a woman gave birth prematurely, it would not be so small and have all the facial features. Therefore, I stored it in a bottle and soaked it in alcohol. However, because the child's flesh was already bluish-purple at the time and gradually turned black, I exposed it to the sun to mummify it. Now it is stored in a box. If you want to see it, I can show it to you.</p>
<h3>The Strange Appearance of the Tiny Person</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Shen, this kind of child corpse is rare, but it is also not that rare. The child's corpse is less than an inch long, but its eyebrows, eyes, and mouth are all complete. When it was picked up, I examined it closely with a 10x microscope, and I saw all the details, such as the scrotum between the tiny legs. There was also a tiny hole behind its anus. It was no different from the appearance of a normal person. However, its head seemed too large when viewed in relation to its whole body. In addition, the umbilical cord had not been cut and was still hanging out. Therefore, the entire corpse was a tiny male corpse. This kind of corpse must have been caused by abnormal physiology; otherwise, it would not have been like this. However, this kind of abnormal physiology has never been heard of before.</p>
<h3>Showing the Remains</h3>
<p>After Mr. Shen finished speaking, he showed the remains of the tiny person. The body was stored in a rectangular paper box. When the lid was opened, there was indeed a rudimentary child's corpse. The flesh had already rotted away, but the black and dry flesh below the navel remained. Because it had been exposed to the sun, there was no more stench. The child's head was about six tenths of an inch long, and the eye sockets and nasal bridge were clearly visible. The mouth was open, and the upper and lower lips were huge, resembling those of a monkey, unlike a human mouth. The ribs in the chest were very thin. The umbilical cord was still dragging outside the navel. The bones of both hands and feet were clearly visible, and the fingers and toes were all intact. It was a pity that the flesh had already rotted away. The reporters had brought a camera with them, but because the child's corpse was too small and the color of the corpse was difficult to photograph clearly, they were unable to do so. Looking at the entire corpse, it was indeed rare. Based on this observation, it was definitely caused by a villager's abnormal birth. At the time, they must have thought it was ominous, so they threw it into the river, where it was fortunately retrieved. Do-gooders then embellished the story, and thus there was the absurd rumor of the stone enclosure with tiny people.</p>

<p>A Hooligan Badly Injures a Strong Man Near the New Asia Hotel</p>
<p>Knives and Clubs Were Used, Blood Was Everywhere, Bones Were Broken, Legs Were Severely Injured || Why Did the Fight Start? He Refuses to Confess || At around 12 noon yesterday near the New Asia Hotel at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Tiantong Road, more than ten Guangdong hooligans, each wielding iron clubs, iron rulers, and sharp blades, had a brawl with a strong man from Guangdong. Due to the disparity in numbers, the strong man was ultimately no match and turned to flee into the nearby Renhe Lane. However, the hooligans did not let up and chased after him. When they caught up, they used knives and clubs to severely injure the strong man, who fell to the ground in the lane with blood everywhere. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the hooligans scattered like birds and beasts. A crowd of onlookers gathered. Fortunately, the nearby police officers heard the alarm and quickly reported it to the police station, which dispatched a car to rush the injured man to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Upon examination, it was discovered that he had many wounds. He had been cut once below his right eye, his skull had been broken by an iron ruler, and his legs were severely injured. His life was in great danger. It was heard that his name was Luo Songsheng, a native of Guangdong, 29 years old, and formerly a senior accountant. As for why the fight started, he was evasive and did not say anything. Therefore, the police station is currently investigating and pursuing the perpetrators.</p>

This shows the greatness of Chen's achievements during his lifetime and the depth of his inspiration.</p>
<h3>Stealing a Doctor's Seal and Falsely Issuing a Diagnosis to Cover Up a Murder Case</h3>
<p>Dr. Huang Arrests Xu of Niu Pu and Brings Her to the Authorities</p>
<p>The Chengchangxiang Jewelry Store at No. 57 Zhangchuan Lane, Xinbeimen, is opened by Pu, a native of Suzhou. It has been in business for years, and its livelihood is still good. Three years ago, Pu had a maid who suddenly died violently. At that time, there was talk on the street, and everyone said that she had been beaten to death by the mistress. However, the Pu family kept silent about it. However, the household registration section of the First Sub-Bureau of the Second District required Pu to obtain a diagnosis from any doctor before it could be approved. Pu had no choice but to ask Huang Weimin, a pox doctor living at No. 4 Wangma Yilong, to issue a diagnosis for proof. However, Dr. Huang resolutely refused, considering his reputation and the importance of human life. Unexpectedly, Pu had a whimsical idea at the time and secretly sent his son, Zhenlin, to Huang's house to play. Taking advantage of the opportunity, he secretly stole Dr. Huang's seal and used a false diagnosis to deceive the First Sub-Bureau of the Second District, and Dr. Huang was unaware of it. Unexpectedly, until recently, Pu's daughter-in-law abused an apprentice in the store, and the apprentice reported the matter to Dr. Huang. Huang was furious when he heard this and went to Pu yesterday to question him. Pu knew that things were not going well and took the opportunity to escape. Huang arrested Pu's wife, Xu, and handed her over to the bureau. After Chief Shen briefly interrogated her, he prepared a document to submit to the Judicial Section for review on charges of murder and stealing a seal.</p>

<p>A Russian man named沃古里去佛辣田斯辣佛(transliteration), 34 years old this year, is currently serving as a reserve team No. 26 police officer in the French Concession Police. His wife is in Qingdao, and Wo is alone in Shanghai, so he stays in the dormitory of the Xiamfei Road Songyou Road Police Station. For some unknown reason, he suddenly used a rifle to commit suicide in the dormitory at 11:20 p.m. the night before. The bullet hit his left abdomen and exited from his back. His companions were awakened by the sound of gunfire in their sleep and reported it to the police chief, who sent him to Guangci Hospital. He died from his injuries in half an hour. The police station has now sent the body to the autopsy center attached to the Municipal Council Hospital on Terrace Road and will report to the Second Special Court today to send personnel for examination. It is said that the deceased has a daughter in Shanghai, but she cannot be found for the time being.</p>
<h3>Li Zhongyang Mourns Two Corpses: His Wife and Brother Commit Suicide One After Another</h3>
<p>Chen, a woman from Zhenjiang, 38 years old, lived upstairs in the Luhaiji Barber Shop at No. 385 North Xiangfen Lane. The other day, after an argument with her husband's elder brother, Dafeng, they suddenly committed suicide one after another. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Later, after the Old Zhabei Police Station ordered detectives Xie Guisheng and others to investigate, they took the bodies of the man and woman to the Feilun Road Autopsy Center. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court dispatched Prosecutor Guo Wei, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and Secretary Wang Zuyi, to the center to verify the bodies. They then questioned Li Zhongyang, who claimed to be 39 years old and worked as a foreign goods broker. Yesterday, his wife had an argument with his elder brother, but he did not know what caused it. As a result, his wife suddenly had thoughts of ending her life and secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. When it was discovered, he sent her to the hospital for treatment. At that time, his elder brother also went to the hospital to inquire. According to the doctor, the poison had entered her lungs and there was no hope of recovery. When he heard this, he was disappointed and returned home, where he hanged himself. He now requested that the two bodies be returned to him for coffin burial. After obtaining the statement, Guo ruled that the deceased, Chen, a female, had died from opium poisoning before her death. Li Dafeng, a male, had hanged himself before his death. The bodies were handed over to Li Zhongyang to take back for coffin burial after he signed a guarantee.</p>
<h3>Fruit Peddlers Arrested and Fined by the Police Station Yesterday Requested Relief from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions</h3>
<p>More than 1,000 fruit peddlers selling fruit on Fujian Road and Zhengjia Muqiao in the Public Concession have been severely suppressed and fined by the police station due to the negative impact of unscrupulous peddlers.</p>
<h3>Deprived of a Livelihood</h3>
<p>At around 1 p.m. yesterday afternoon, more than 100 peddlers specially contacted their colleagues and went to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to petition. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied that the matter was initiated by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, so they were instructed to present the situation to the Federation. Changwei Zhang Xianfang and others from the Federation received the peddlers, and representatives Hong A'chu and Wang Shouchao reported that the police station was severely suppressing them based on a letter from the Second District Branch of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions on July 16.</p>
<h3>Soliciting on the Road</h3>
<p>The unscrupulous peddlers selling foreign socks and undershirts would flee at the sight of public officials. The police officers arrested the formal peddlers with permits to the police station and fined them five jiao each, or even arrested them and fined them three or four times a day, depriving them of their livelihood. They specially requested to be transferred to the Municipal Council to allow the peddlers to</p>
<h3>Resume Business</h3>
<p>And not be arrested, etc. Zhang Xianfang replied that this fact was directly communicated to the Municipal Council by the Second District Branch. The Federation did not forward this letter. You should still contact the Second District Branch to</p>
<h3>Untie the Knot</h3>
<p>Hong and Wang immediately went with the crowd to the Second District Branch at the intersection of Sima Road and Shilu Road to demand everything. The original letter from the peddlers to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is appended below: "We, the people, have been selling fruit on the road for more than 1,000 people, obtaining permits to sell for several years, and earning a little</p>
<h3>Meager Profit</h3>
<p>To support our families. Recently, there have been a group of vagrants selling foreign socks and undershirts along the road. Not only do they not obtain permits, but they also solicit on the road. Once they encounter an arrest, they scatter. Moreover, several people gather in one place to sell foreign socks and undershirts, which is related to the road administration. They are suppressed by the police station. The Second District Citizens' Branch under your association sent a letter to your association to negotiate with the concession authorities to suppress them. The police station then ordered the police to arrest them. The peddlers selling foreign socks and undershirts scattered and fled, causing us fruit sellers to be innocently implicated and arrested to the police station, and</p>
<h3>Fined Five Jiao Each</h3>
<p>We are arrested and fined three or four times a day. We cannot work in peace, and our families are waiting to die. Therefore, we have gathered at the entrance of your association and elected two of us to request relief. We promised to submit another official report to the association for review. Therefore, we specially request your association to show compassion and consider both sides, and</p>
<h3>Write to the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Explain that we are allowed to resume business and save the lives of more than 1,000 of our colleagues and their families. We will be grateful. The police station arrested us before, but not as urgently. When the Second District Citizens' Branch negotiated to suppress us, the police station arrested us more severely, causing more than 1,000 of our lives to be immediately left to die. Combined statement."</p>

<h3>Recent Situation of the YMCA Western Restaurant</h3>
<p>The YMCA Western Restaurant on Sichuan Road is inexpensive and delicious, which is unmatched by other restaurants. The pricing is also very economical. Recently, ladies from all walks of life and banquets from various schools during the summer vacation have been very enthusiastic. Many kinds of cold drinks and food have been added, and everything is available.

<h3>The Second Batch of Haining Watermelons Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Haining is famous for producing watermelons. The watermelon flavor is fragrant and crisp, and it quenches thirst. It is the only wonderful product in summer. Unfortunately, the output is not large and is only enough to meet the needs of local people. Therefore, there has been no sale in Shanghai. Now, a villager named Sun Ruming tried to transport more than 100 loads to Shanghai on the 20th of this month and entrusted the introduction department of the National Goods Monthly to sell them on his behalf. They were sold out in half a day, and those who came later were disappointed. Therefore, Sun returned to his hometown to purchase the second batch, which will be shipped to Shanghai today (the 24th). Each load is still sold for three yuan. The introduction department of the National Goods Monthly at No. 114 Cihou South Lane, Hatong Road, sells them on its behalf. Call 94741 to order, and they can also be delivered.</p>
<h3>Amé Loudspeaker Sells Well</h3>
<p>Shanghai Amé Company on Jiangxi Road has been improving its products for the past eleven years. Therefore, both wireless experts and amateurs praise its manufacturing as serious and standard domestic products. Last spring, the company also researched and manufactured loudspeakers. At first, because they were the same as the ordinary products on the market, the sound was sharp and noisy, so they were not immediately sold. After more than ten months of research and improvement in the testing room, the low-frequency part can be amplified from 50 cycles, which can be compared with the superior imported products. It was released to the world on the 20th of this month, namely the Amé 1009 Balanced Reed Loudspeaker, priced at 10 yuan each. During the low-price period, buy one get one free. If you buy only one, it only costs six yuan. Because of the loudness of the sound, the purchase is extremely enthusiastic. It is heard that an average of more than 1,000 are sold every day.</p>
<h3>Dari Pao Rewards Readers</h3>
<p>The "Dari Pao," which rose suddenly, has been well received by the society since its publication on July 1, and the number of sales has increased daily. Now, in order to implement the purpose of serving society, the newspaper has specially formulated preferential trial reading methods. All people from all walks of life in this city and other places who want to read the newspaper can pay only one yuan, including postage, for a three-month subscription. However, in order to allow readers to verify whether the content is worth reading, it is not necessary to pay the newspaper fee first before subscribing. Just write down your name and address, and the newspaper will send it to you daily. In this city, a special messenger will deliver it by bicycle. After reading it for one month, if the readers are satisfied, they can pay one yuan for the newspaper fee in the second month and continue to read it for two months. According to this one yuan newspaper fee, excluding the postage for three months, it only costs one jiao. However, the newspaper is willing to make great sacrifices in order to reward readers. Those who love to read newspapers but have not read "Dari Pao" should not miss this opportunity. The address of the newspaper office is Wangping Street, Shanghai, phone 93501.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Goods Company Gives Away Discount Coupons</h3>
<p>Shanghai National Goods Company, located opposite the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road, is offering special cheap sales on various seasonal summer goods as the weather has gradually become cooler recently. For example, printed silk fabrics in various colors in the silk and satin department were originally 4.8 jiao per foot, but starting today, buy one foot get one foot free. The Guangdong top-grade Kao Yun yarn and heavy double crepe robe material are only sold for one yuan per piece. Customers who purchase goods for more than two yuan will receive a special discount coupon. With the coupon, they can still purchase daily-use national goods, and they will be greatly sacrificed. One is mainly to clear out summer inventory, and the other is to take the opportunity to give preferential treatment to ladies from all walks of life to use more national goods. The opportunity is rare. Those who usually love to use national goods should not miss this opportunity.</p>
<h3>The Publishing Industry: The Bottle History of Yuan Zhonglang is Republished</h3>
<p>Huang Shian, a judge of the Supreme Court, accidentally obtained a book written by Yuan Zhonglang of the Ming Dynasty, The Bottle History, in a bookstore while he was in Japan. The content lists the methods of arranging cut flowers in bottles, as well as the suitability and avoidance of flowers, and the elegance and vulgarity of bottles. It is very detailed. He took it back and found that it had been lost in China for a long time. Therefore, he re-edited and printed the book, attaching the Bottle History Monthly Table compiled by Tu Benuan of Yongdong, the Flower Calendar Nickname compiled by Cheng Yuwen of Lianjiang, and the Bottle Flower Manual compiled by Zhang Qiande of Wuxian, and gave the title Preface by Dean Ju, named The Bottle History of Yuan Zhonglang.

<p>Is This Also Considered Experience? Zhou Yun Sweats While Reading and Sweats While Working, Three Letters from the Mailbox</p>
<p>Is This Also Considered Experience? Zhou Yun</p>
<p>The word "experience" has different meanings in different life realms. When a person recounts their own experiences, people in different living environments may not be interested, but those in the same living environment will be deeply moved. Moreover, experiences from different life circles, as long as the writing is sincere, I think this is a good medium for providing everyone with a way to understand all aspects of society. People who take a serious attitude towards life will not fail to pay attention to lives outside their own circles.</p>
<p>I will now describe my personal reading experiences.</p>
<p>Each time I borrow or buy a favorite new book from the library, I feel extremely happy. I plan how to become familiar with this book, how to understand its contents, how to note the essence of the book on the first read, how to record it again on the second read, how to finish the first read in five days, the second read in eight days, how to allocate some time, how to make use of all my spare time amidst my busy schedule... However, when I have arranged my work or want to read in my spare time, I always find the noise of machines distracting, my mood is uneasy and I cannot concentrate. Either I rush through the first read, or I am completely disappointed and cannot even open the book. As a result, the deadline quickly arrives, and I cannot even start, the book still remains stagnant at the beginning of the second read. Books I buy myself are even less likely to be read to the end, or I am attracted by other books and put this one aside. As for the impression I get? It becomes as vague as light smoke in a clear sky, or shadows in dim light.</p>
<p>The main reason for this, of course, can be said to be the unfavorable environment, but the lack of proper life tempering is also an important reason.</p>
<p>In despair, I recall the "On Reading for Mobile Living People" and "If the environment is satisfactory, one does not want to read..." "Waiting for a comfortable environment to read is tantamount to waiting for gold to fall from the sky..." sharp words published in this column, and I am filled with shame. For people like us, I think life tempering is more important than reading, and reading should be regarded as a form of life tempering. I feel that for those of us who only have one to three hours of free time each day, we do not need to "browse extensively through books," but only need to select a few correct and worthwhile books in our self-study subjects, and savor them carefully at any time, while applying the theories in the books to all aspects of real life. I have been doing this for the past two months and feel that I have made much progress.</p>
<p>Therefore, I offer this to our friends.</p>
<h3>One Week</h3>
<p>(1) Sweating While Reading and Sweating While Working: Within a week, we received more than a dozen letters from readers protesting against our "invisible shortening of office hours due to the hot weather." Most of them work twelve hours a day, and after twelve hours of life, they still have to read and write letters. Summer retreat is naturally not something this circle of life dreams of. They reproach us for not being able to work up a sweat like the wealthy, saying, "A teacher of the masses should endure suffering with the masses. Our reproach may be a bit harsh, but it seems we don't need to be polite to those close to us, right?" After receiving these letters, we were truly ashamed. We called a meeting of all staff members and had a discussion. As a result, everyone was willing to extend their working hours. So everyone excitedly "sweated while working," and our studio became more tense as a result. However, everything is voluntary, and no one is forced to work more than the scheduled hours, yet no staff member is unwilling to complete their daily tasks voluntarily. We are publishing this news not to boast, but to show that we are very willing to align our lives with the lives of our readers. We hope that readers will often offer such reproaches and督促.</p>
<h3>Mailbox</h3>
<p>(1) All Communications from August 1st Must Use Stationery Printed by This Department: August 1st is approaching. Readers who have not yet purchased the reader communication stationery, please prepare it within a week for communication purposes. Each book contains one hundred pages and costs only 20 cents in cost, plus 5 cents for postage to other locations, and 2 cents to this location. Stamps are fully accepted. This library sells them at the cashier.</p>
<p>(2) Fill in All Blank Items on the Communication Stationery Before Writing: The purpose of standardized communication stationery is to investigate the lives of readers, facilitate statistics, and maintain uniformity. Now many readers, although they have switched to communication paper, have neglected to fill in the required items. This is no different from readers providing their own paper. This is completely contrary to our purpose. I am now making a special request that everyone pay attention and not neglect it again. This is the second announcement.</p>
<p>(3) Reasons for Not Replying to Letters: We will always respond to inquiries regarding reading or knowledge exploration, as long as we are confident in our ability to do so. As for delays of up to half a month or a month, these may occur, but we always reply. The letters that we do not reply to generally discuss matters outside our scope, or are too specialized. If we cannot find someone suitable to answer, we have no choice but to not reply. We also send separate notifications for letters that are beyond our capabilities to answer. As for the "scope" referred to, readers can understand it by examining our past work. This is not because we deliberately avoid reality, but because our position is inherently so. Our original mission is to relieve readers of their quest for knowledge!</p>

<h3>A Fragrant Record of the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Then another person would search through their own luggage to find some more valuable clothes or utensils, quietly slip out the back door, pawn them at a pawnshop for dozens of taels of silver, and then come back to appease those eunuchs. Sometimes, when they really had nothing left to pawn at home, they would inevitably take out things bestowed by the Empress Dowager and pawn them temporarily. Therefore, the more generous the Empress Dowager was in her rewards, the poorer her relatives became. What could be done about this? I have observed coldly from the sidelines, and the Empress Dowager must have been very aware of these situations; because there were many people suffering, and her eyes and ears were very thorough, even the most minute things were reported to her, let alone these larger incidents? Then what exactly was her reason for wanting to harm her relatives in such a fanciful way? Apart from herself, I am afraid no one can answer this question!</p>
<p>Readers probably never expected that relatives of the emperor could suffer so much! I can write some more for you to see: Anyone who is related to the emperor or the Empress Dowager will at least have a noble title. With a title, they must try their best to maintain appearances, even the slightest thing, like a piece of clothing, cannot be too shabby; but they really do not have much money, but for fear of offending the Empress Dowager, they have no choice but to save every penny and concentrate all their efforts on maintaining an empty appearance. This kind of suffering is unimaginable to ordinary people! In fact, the Empress Dowager has plenty of money! Let alone the national treasury, the Empress Dowager's own private savings amount to at least several million: She only needs to lift a finger to help her relatives, and she doesn't even need to use public funds from the court. Who would dare criticize her? But she herself disdains to lift a finger! I am very dissatisfied with her malicious and heartless behavior.</p>
<p>One of our companions was also Yuan Da Nǎinai. (Translator's note: Yuan Da Nǎinai's surname is not "Yuan"; Yuan is her nickname. Her father is one of the main characters in this book - Qing Shan, the Minister of the Imperial Household Department). This person has a very special history, which can also be said to be a very painful history. (89)</p>
<h3>The Formula of Three Sons</h3>
<p>— Xian Tie</p>
<p>The reason for the decline of social undertakings is mostly due to the fact that wealthy people put all their efforts into their families, seeking the benefit of "complete fortune." The name "complete fortune" means wanting more fortune, more longevity, and more sons. In other words, fortune is money, longevity is a beard, and sons are descendants, so the thoughts that constantly run through their minds are:</p>
<p>Money!</p>
<p>Sons!</p>
<p>Beards!</p>
<p>According to fortune-tellers who believe in fate and rely on the eight characters (of birth date), people's desires can never be completely filled, and it is as difficult as ascending to heaven to achieve all three. Unless one has nine parts out of ten of foolishness, one can achieve a satisfactory outcome. Like these modern, protruding and receding, sharp heads, even if they barely succeed, they can never escape the following three formulas:</p>
<p>(1) Those with a beautiful beard and sons to carry on the family line will definitely lack money.</p>
<p>(2) Those with all-powerful money and a beautiful beard will definitely lack sons, and</p>
<p>(3) Those with sons to carry on the family line and all-powerful money will definitely lack a beard.</p>

<h3>Husband and Wife Fighting</h3>
<p>— Zhang Muliang</p>
<p>My neighbor, Brother Liu and Sister-in-law Liu, were eating dinner when they started arguing over something.</p>
<p>I usually don't interfere in other people's business, but this time their argument was too intense, so I tried to persuade them a few times. Who knew that when I went over, they argued even more fiercely. Without a word, they started fighting without considering the consequences!</p>
<p>Brother Liu roused his spirits and pounced on Sister-in-law Liu like a fierce tiger, landing a punch. Sister-in-law Liu, in pain, refused to show weakness and fought back with all her might. But how could Sister-in-law Liu beat Brother Liu? So Sister-in-law Liu shouted, "Okay, you heartless brute! You hit me! You hit me..." and retreated. She suddenly grabbed a rice bowl and threw it at Brother Liu's head. With a "thud," blood dripped from Brother Liu's head! Seeing them fighting like this, my heart was pounding, so I wanted to pull them apart forcefully. But before I could pull them apart, Brother Liu accidentally hit my wrist, and it hurt so much that I could barely move it.</p>
<p>Later, my sister came to call me for dinner, and I took the opportunity to leave. As I left, I still heard Brother Liu say, "Damn it! If I don't beat you to death tonight, I'm not a man!" They said many more unpleasant things that I didn't bother to listen to.</p>
<p>The next day, I went to Brother Liu's house to see how they were doing. They were happily eating snacks, having completely forgotten about yesterday's events. When they saw me, they insisted that I eat snacks. I saw how serious the wound on Brother Liu's head was! And my own wrist was still aching.</p>
<p>In the end, I realized that there's no need for outsiders to mediate when a husband and wife are fighting.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 32: The General Indulges in Pleasure All Day Long, While Soldiers Weep, How Many Will Return?</p>
<p>Gui Zhi arrived at the entrance of the grain store, turned sideways, and hid under a straight pillar, waiting. Sure enough, opposite the earthen warehouse wall, under the tall red gate tower, a silver-gray sedan stopped. A soldier with a box cannon opened the car door and stood aside waiting. After a while, a woman in a gray-squirrel coat walked out with a man in a Western suit. After seeing the man, Gui Zhi not only dared not look at him directly, but also dared not look at that concubine, and turned around and walked into the house. It turned out that the man she saw was the man she met on the road the other day who laughed at her. She had been embarrassed and scared for half a day. Unexpectedly, he had now become a neighbor, and he had seen her again, and he was a powerful division commander. Wasn't she asking for trouble? She shouldn't stand at the gate and let him see her again. She hid so quickly because she thought she could avoid trouble. However, that Division Commander Quan's eyesight was no worse than hers, and he also saw her. He thought her hair was black and shiny, and her face was fair and clean. Without the help of makeup, her natural beauty was even better than modern women. But he only glanced at her quickly and saw that the clothes on her abdomen were a little bulging. Could she be a woman who already had a husband? Fortunately, she came out of that grain store, so she must have some connection with that grain store. Living across the street, he wasn't afraid of not being able to find out. He had this thought in his mind. When he returned home in the afternoon, he ordered his adjutant to inquire about whether there were young women entering and leaving the grain store across the street. As soon as the adjutant heard his words, he knew what he meant. In less than an hour, he returned to report that she was not from the grain store, but was a new neighbor who had recently moved in, an old couple, with a daughter, and another male servant. He heard that the old man was in business. When Division Commander Quan heard this, he thought that people who did business would do anything as long as there was money to be made. Especially the old ladies, they were even easier to deal with. (440)</p>
<h3>The Bund Park</h3>
<p>— Yu Hong</p>
<p>The fiery sun had already withdrawn its intense heat and was gradually setting in the west. A gust of evening wind rippled through the sultry city, and the people oppressed by the heat seemed to gradually awaken as if they had met sweet rain after a long drought!</p>
<p>Many people walked along the riverbank toward the park with the sign "Chinese and Dogs Not Allowed." Fortunately, the Chinese have finally been liberated from the status of dogs and are enjoying the fair treatment of humans?</p>
<p>Along the riverbank, there are many low chairs with backs, and people sit in rows like the old women in an inn, sitting quietly. The large moon hanging in the sky shines across the river, illuminating every weary face. The tide surges like a hurricane, pushing along fishing boats one by one, and cutting off the evening songs.</p>
<p>In the shade of the trees and among the flowers, there are sweet words of love, giggling and coquettish laughter, and low whispers of resentment and longing. At the same time, there are also some people wandering around, mostly busy chasing after the opposite sex.</p>

<p>Basic Knowledge</p>
<h3>The Advantages and Disadvantages of Drinking Tea</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>The tea we usually drink is generally divided into two types: black and green tea. However, regardless of which type of tea leaves, they all contain tea elements, tannic acid, tannin, protein, caffeine, exin, and other elements. The strength, thickness, fragrance, bitterness, and astringency of the tea taste vary depending on the amount of these ingredients. Among them, the two elements that have become major issues in academia are caffeine and tannic acid. Caffeine dissolves in water immediately, while tannic acid dissolves slowly. For example, when brewed with boiling water, caffeine will be extracted, but tannic acid requires several brews with boiling water to be extracted. Therefore, the first brew of tea must be fragrant, because the caffeine, which has volatile aromatic components, is completely extracted by the boiling water. Caffeine is rich in excitatory effects, is a white needle-like crystal, slightly bitter, and is most easily stimulated by the brain nerves, heart, and kidneys, so drinking a cup of tea when mentally tired can invigorate the spirit, but drinking too much will increase fatigue. In addition, it also has the functions of promoting digestion, circulating blood, dilating kidney blood vessels, and promoting urination. Tannic acid is a colorless, blocky substance with an astringent taste and has the power to attract the mucous membranes of the stomach and intestines. Generally, high-quality famous teas contain a lot of caffeine. The aroma of Longjing, jasmine, Wuyi, Pu'er, red plum, and other teas is better because of this. However, our stomach wall, stimulated by a large amount of caffeine and absorbed, will gradually suffer from chronic gastritis, and the brain and heart will often be excited, leading to nervous system hypersensitivity and heart weakness. However, the nature of tea is the same as that of wine. There are people who cannot sleep after drinking one or two cups of tea every day, and there are people who are comfortable and fine after drinking dozens of cups of wine every day, all because of habits that have been formed. There are many types of tea leaves in our country, and their shape and color vary due to different manufacturing methods. Black tea is fermented tea leaves that turn reddish-brown, brick tea is made by pressing tea leaves into blocks, and other famous teas such as sparrow's tongue, round beans, and crescent moon are too numerous to mention. If you go to the Western-style Tea Industry Association in this port and take a look, there are no fewer than a hundred types of names and complex shapes. However, no matter what kind of deformed and renamed, the caffeine content remains unchanged. There is a strange and bad habit among Chinese people. There are tea houses and teahouses in both cities and villages, and they drink all day long, happily and tirelessly. However, Chinese people drink tea mainly for the aroma, except for special tea drinkers. On the other hand, Westerners love strong and thick aromas. This is due to different national tastes and habits.</p>
<p>Coffee and cocoa are the same as tea, both containing caffeine. Caffeine varies in type depending on its place of origin. The ingredients that differ from tea are as follows: the effective ingredient of green and black tea is 2.0, coffee is 0, up to 1.5, cocoa is 1.5, and there is also 50% fat. That is, the caffeine contained in coffee is less than in green and black tea, but because coffee is added with sugar and boiled over high heat, the brewed liquid is thicker than tea, and the caffeine content is also high, so Westerners suffer from stomach diseases from drinking coffee and cocoa, just like Chinese people drinking tea, and like people who drink alcohol being stimulated. Because the alcohol in wine has the same effect as the caffeine in tea, coffee, and cocoa, the intensity of the effect of drinking one ounce of sorghum wine, half a catty of Shaoxing wine, and one bottle of beer, of course, is the strongest with one cup of sorghum wine. Why? Although the amount of alcohol absorbed in the stomach is about the same, the concentration in the stomach is very different. When drinking an ounce of sorghum liquor on an empty stomach, there is 10 to 15 percent of alcohol, while Shaoxing wine and beer have more water, but contain 4 to 5 percent. Because of the concentration of the quality, the stomach is stimulated, so there are different degrees of severity, so people who do not drink wine but love to drink tea receive the same stimulation. Drinking a cup of strong tea is equivalent to drinking one catty of rice wine. I have an indissoluble bond with alcohol throughout my life, but I hate drinking tea the most, because my stomach wall has become accustomed to the stimulation of alcohol. If I drink a cup of strong tea, I cannot withstand the strong caffeine stimulation and will get stomach problems.</p>
<p>The park where "Chinese and dogs are not allowed" is now filled with the voices of Chinese people. Returning from my experience, I am secretly rejoicing, but the foreign warships that cut off the river flow are still flaunting themselves in front of me. Secretly rejoicing, I cannot help but shed tears!</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education's Report</h3>
<p>The Significance of Holding a Summer Training Class for Boy Scout Instructors: The Class Held Its Opening Ceremony Yesterday Morning! Chairman Hao Gengsheng; The Ministry of Education's Boy Scout Instructors' Summer Training Class Held Its Delayed Opening Ceremony at the Nanjing Middle School Auditorium at 7 AM Yesterday Morning (The class had already started on the 16th). Minister of Education Wang Shijie, Director of the Ministry of Education's General Education Department Gu Shusen, Director of the General Affairs Department Lei Zhen, and other guests attended. All teachers, staff, and students of the class, numbering over 400, were present. After the ceremony at 7 AM, Chairman and Head Teacher Hao Gengsheng gave a report, stating that the Ministry of Education, valuing boy scout education, had issued a notice to all junior high schools to make boy scouts a required subject starting from the next academic year. At the same time, this class was organized as the foundation for implementing boy scout training in middle schools. Currently, there are 369 students, including representatives from 18 provinces, 4 special municipalities, and the Weihaiwei Special District. Shandong has 44 students, Zhejiang 38, Jiangsu 35, Anhui 31, Jiangxi 30, Fujian 27, Hunan 25, Henan 26, Shaanxi 19, Hubei 18, Hebei 14, Shanxi 5, Suiyuan 4, Sichuan and Guangdong each have 2, Liaoning and Guizhou each have 1, Shanghai 25, Nanjing 10, Qingdao 5, Beiping 2, and Weihaiwei 3. After Hao's report, Minister of Education Wang Shijie delivered a speech, stating that the Ministry of Education had been paying close attention to the improvement of secondary education since four or five years ago, including promulgating secondary school curriculum standards, stipulating equipment standards for secondary schools, and implementing secondary school graduation examinations, all of which focused on instilling knowledge in students, aiming to raise the level of secondary schools. However, widespread criticism arose in society that secondary education focused too much on the instillation of knowledge and neglected the cultivation of students' character. Educational administrators and teachers in schools should sincerely accept and strive to correct this criticism of "teaching without training." If secondary education from now on makes boy scouts a required subject, and uses boy scout training to cultivate young people's character, then the malpractice of "teaching without training" can be eradicated after a few years. This is one of the reasons for holding the summer training class for boy scout instructors. The implementation of moral education in secondary schools is indeed a very complex and difficult problem to solve. Currently, schools have special moral education committees or moral education directors responsible for the moral guidance of all students, but due to insufficient contact with students' daily lives, the results are minimal. Based on personal experience, if physical training and moral education are combined, paying attention to both the cultivation of students' character and the strengthening of their physical fitness, then the results will be significant. Boy scout training can indeed achieve the goal of combining physical training and moral education. This is the second reason for holding this class. Recently, key members of the central government and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek have advocated for the New Life Movement, which aims to cultivate habits of neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, diligence, speed, and certainty in us, and to seek the revival of the Chinese nation. This aligns with the purpose of boy scout education. Therefore, the boy scout organization is a way to promote the New Life Movement among young people in general. Furthermore, from the perspective of learning psychology, habit formation is most effective in youth. Habit formation or removal is more difficult after adulthood. Boy scout training instructors bear the mission of cultivating good habits in young people, indirectly seeking the promotion of the New Life Movement. This is the third reason for holding this class. For the above three reasons, the Ministry of Education attaches great importance to the completion of the mission undertaken by this class. In addition, there are three things that are hoped to be achieved by taking advantage of this short-term training class for boy scout training. Roughly speaking, I will tell you about them. (1) Popularizing the boy scout organization - The Ministry of Education has made military training a required subject, aiming to popularize boy scout training in schools across the country. However, the most important prerequisite is the training of boy scout teachers. This is one of the goals of this class. (2) Unifying the goals of boy scout training - Currently, the goals of boy scout training vary greatly in different regions. In order to reform youth training nationwide, it is necessary to first unify the goals of boy scout training in secondary schools nationwide. This is the second goal of this class. (3) Unifying boy scout training methods - This time, experienced and outstanding boy scout education experts from across the country have been gathered together to teach various boy scout training methods, which will be popularized to various regions in the future, so the methods can be unified. This is the third goal of this class. Today, all the teachers and students present have come from afar, braving the scorching heat. They should deeply understand the reasons and goals for the Ministry of Education's organization of this class. After receiving short-term training, they will be distributed to various regions to bear the serious mission of improving youth training and promoting the New Life Movement. Then, within a certain period of time, they will surely be able to create a new belief in secondary education in society, indirectly contributing to the revival of the Chinese nation. This is what I pray for. After Wang's speech, everyone took a group photo and dispersed.</p>
<h3>The All-Beijing Student Federation for Occupational Movements' Letter to University Graduates Nationwide</h3>
<p>—Seeking a way back but unable to find it, looking around in hesitant steps—</p>
<p>Hoping for concerted action among students everywhere, breaking the slogan of "graduation means unemployment". (Beijing News) Since the arrival in Beijing of Tan Shuzhen, Yang Daogeng, and other representatives of the All-Beijing Student Federation for Occupational Movements, they have repeatedly petitioned the highest party and government authorities to properly arrange jobs for graduating students. Believing that this matter concerns the future of students nationwide, the representatives issued a letter to graduating students of universities across the country, as follows: "In the sweltering heat of summer, as the farewell song is sung, we, graduating students of universities across the country, bid farewell to our alma maters amidst mournful tunes. The feelings in our hearts cannot be described in words. Looking around at society, what are its thoughts on these lonely geese leaving the flock with sorrow? What relief does this vast country offer to these surplus talents? Family support is exhausted, and their expectations for us are great. The relationship between teachers and students is severed, and we become strangers in the blink of an eye. Seeking a way back but unable to find it, looking around in hesitant steps. We share the same fate, and our hearts are filled with a desire to help others. At this precarious and solitary moment, what we rely on to support and guide us is</p>
<h3>mutual connection</h3>
<p>for planned and organized movements, so that we can safely cross the vast ocean and discover our brilliance. Like transporting wood, without deception or fraud, like building a wall, those who can build build, those who can fill fill, those who can lift lift, each doing their best to contribute. Therefore, we hereby announce the aims of our federation to our fellow students, seeking unanimous response and urging attention from the government and society. In the past, the state established schools with the aim of cultivating specialized talents for the benefit of society. However, the result was that true talents were buried while imposters thrived. Although society was overpopulated, the government still felt the lack of talent. The reason for this is that selection was unfair, and promotion was excessive. Those who cherished their talents grew old in poverty, while the shameless climbed and stole positions. They closed doors and refused others to interfere, hiding filth and making it difficult for the government to be clean. As a result, there were more talents, but more unemployment. Barriers increased, but government affairs deteriorated. Exhausting the people's resources, they could not even satisfy the appetites of those who lived off the fat of the land, let alone have the surplus to develop industries and place talents. For thirty years, no matter what subject one studied or what specialty one possessed, the government and education were the final destinations. This is the clear evidence. The malpractices have gone so far as to treat education as private property, regard schools as businesses, manipulate and control, and seek profit. They only know how to recruit students, not caring about their future. Although the government is distressed by this, it has not thoroughly cracked down on it, resulting in a surplus of talents, misuse of education, disputes and competition, resentment and suicide, as well as going astray and falling into depravity, which is countless. Who is the source of this evil, and who should bear the blame? We, who have been sacrificed by this bad education, can only unite to seek a solution to employment through open movements. Therefore, we established this federation on July 1st. Five hundred students have joined, receiving support from social figures and the media. Students from various places have heard that similar movements are about to take place, which truly meets the needs of the times. We should work hard to</p>
<h3>achieve success.</h3>
<p>The future is vast and cannot be saved by one hand or one foot. Only collective effort can turn the tide. We firmly believe that students from all places will uphold the spirit of mutual aid and proceed in different ways. The defect of China lies in the lack of unity among good people, each seeking their own interests and not connecting with each other. The cunning ones can gather followers, seize institutions, and squeeze out righteous people, leading to today's phenomenon of decline and disorder. We deeply reflect on the past mistakes and realize that our survival in the future cannot succeed without mutual assistance. The purpose of mutual assistance is not for immediate gains, but must have noble aspirations, to struggle to solve the unemployment problem of the majority of young people. Furthermore, the revival of the nation, the salvation of the country, the reform of politics, and the renewal of education all depend on whether we can have a thought of mutual assistance. We are the elite of society, having received the cultivation of university education. All responsibilities are heavier than those of ordinary people. At this critical moment of survival, in order to achieve the purpose of responsibility, we must first solve the problem of employment, so that we can contribute what we have learned to the country and society, and seek the balanced development of all departments, so as to save the country from danger. Otherwise, twenty years of hard work will be wasted. Even if we have plans, we cannot tell them. Even if an individual manages to get a job, it will be contrary to what they have learned, and it will be very difficult to carry out their conscience. This is what we believe is a very great purpose in addition to solving our own employment problems. Today, there are hundreds of thousands of unemployed young people in the country. The state of their sorrow and suffering is not fully known to everyone. In the past, we had no powerful organization to promote the attention of the government, and we were limited by material and financial resources, so we could not provide ordinary relief. If we delay again and again, the problem will be more difficult to solve, and eventually we will take risks, which will be a great disaster for the country. We are driven by moral conscience, and to avoid suffering the same pain now and in the future, we only have to devote ourselves to</p>
<h3>the Occupational Movement</h3>
<p>in order to solve our own problems and solve the problems of others. If human beings have no sympathy, they cannot advance together. If they have no unity, they cannot take on important tasks and go far. We often engage in specialized academics, and although we dare not say that we have profound research, we are still better equipped to make a living than ordinary people. However, the country and society make us feel the pain of unemployment even more. Then, the difficulty of making a living for other unemployed people is even more unbearable. If we only care about our own future and do not help our fellow students, then human sympathy will be lost, and in the end, we will compete with each other and suspect each other, and the unity will be completely lost. This is why we abandon the position of individualism and create a collective occupational movement, on the one hand, to make the government and society feel the seriousness of the unemployment problem and seek to solve it, and on the other hand, to change the national habit of selfishness and self-interest, so that we know that fighting for individuals has endless drawbacks, and fighting for groups has immeasurable power. Paying attention to the connection between one school and one department is bound to harm others. Eliminating the boundaries between schools can make each other feel sincere and trust each other, forming a new organization. What is this organization? It is the emergence of this federation. We hope that students from all places will also organize it. We only seek horizontal development and do not need vertical coherence. If we can take the same steps and make requests to the government, then we can temporarily deliberate and decide everything. In short, the organization of this federation is purely for the benefit of all students and to preserve the personality of individuals, so that we must respond to this federation in a society that is superior to the society of accumulation, and must respond to this federation in order to save the country and the nation and improve political education, and must respond to this federation in order to avoid the pain of unemployment and enable us to use our talents, The saying that "graduation means unemployment" should be broken by us, and the slogan that "unemployment means entrepreneurship" should be promoted by us. Without bending, there can be no great instrument, and without danger, there can be no identification of talent. May our beloved students devote themselves to this.</p>

I hope that the people of the country can pay attention to water sports and persevere and practice them diligently. There is nothing that cannot be learned or practiced well. I am very ashamed of my temporary good fortune in the Far East Games this time. I hope that with the encouragement and supervision of all parties, I will seek further progress in the World Games and show some results, so that I can win glory for the country. I have no gifts to bring to Jiangxi this time, but I have brought the four words "save the country through sports" to encourage each other. As soon as I stepped into Jiangxi, all parties were vigorous and new, and I was very excited. I am willing to bring the spirit of saving the country from this source of the new movement to the South and pass it on to the whole country, so as to do my personal work for the society. After I finish my performance here, I will go to Lushan for sightseeing. When I pass through Beijing and Shanghai, I plan to stay for a while to comfort the earnest expectations of all parties.

The market was calm after opening, then rebounded due to bank shortages, and the process was tight. The HSBC Bank's British and American exchange rates remained unchanged. The domestic market turned flat. Banks had both appetite and shortages, and prices merely fluctuated. Finally, the Guangdong banks released some funds.

Afterwards, foreign dispatches reported that the US would continue to purchase 130 million ounces of silver, possibly buying from foreign countries, to issue silver certificates at an unfavorable price of $1.29, leading to a hardening trend.

<h3>Foreign Call Loans Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>The foreign call loan market has remained at 5% since May. Although there were one or two days where it increased by one or two points, it has otherwise remained unchanged, a phenomenon unprecedented in recent years. The reason for this is the bankruptcy of industry and commerce and the loss of financial application, so the market seems nonexistent, leading to such stagnation. The financial future is a cause for great concern. Yesterday's market price remained at 5% for both the morning and afternoon, with watering still starting and ending in blank. Call loan transactions amounted to over 4.1 million in the morning for transfers and new transactions, and over 400,000 in the afternoon. Small exchanges totaled over 200,000. Foreign mortgage loan transactions, including redemption and new transactions, totaled over 1.4 million. Bank collections were smooth due to the start of the week, with foreign banks collecting over 3.2 million in bills, over 4.6 million in various goods, exchange, mortgages, and miscellaneous collections, over 700,000 in telegraphic transfers, and 600,000 in warehouse entries. Chinese banks collected over 4.0 million in bills, over 4.7 million in various goods, exchange, mortgages, and miscellaneous collections, over 600,000 in customs duties, and 400,000 in warehouse entries. Japanese banks collected over 2.9 million in bills, over 4.4 million in various goods, advances, mortgages, and miscellaneous collections, and 400,000 in warehouse exits. Money shops collected over 37 million in foreign public bills, over 5.5 million in foreign overdrafts, over 700,000 in various exchange bills, recovered over 800,000 in banknotes, issued over 1.4 million, released 600,000 in cash, received 300,000 from out-of-town sources, and paid 500,000. The total exchange amount at the Wood Market Clearing House on the 23rd was 1,273,094.71 silver dollars, including 4,042,799.37 silver dollars and 4,230,295.34 overdraft silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Coin Sells Well, Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangsu small silver coins traded lightly and the price was stable. The morning opened at 833 yuan, down 0.02 yuan from the previous day, with 3,000 coins traded. There were no transactions in the afternoon, so the price remained unchanged. Guangzhou small silver coins opened in the morning at 727.5 yuan, with 50,000 coins traded. 120,000 coins were traded in the afternoon, leading to a firm price, reaching 730 yuan. As a result, it was 3.2 yuan better than the previous day. The copper coin market had ample reserves, and the tram company also sold, so although trading was not weak, the opening price was lowered by 2,500 copper coins from the previous day to 330,500 coins per thousand. Transactions were valued at 11,000 foreign yuan, totaling 36,355 strings of copper coins.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Remains Relatively Stable Before Securities Settlement</h3>
<p>＝96 Also Able to Stand Firm Without Major Fluctuations, July Futures Trading Only One Day Today＝</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was stable, with both short and long squeezes, but without major fluctuations. This is because the larger accounts had already negotiated swaps themselves, simplifying procedures and preventing uneven pricing. With fewer large-scale entries and exits in the market, the turbulence naturally calmed down. Although there were multiple long swaps in the 96 public bond, the price also stood firm due to slightly more demand. Today is the last day for July futures, and the market price should still be under pressure. Yesterday, the opening saw scattered retail investors buying in slightly, and the market price initially improved slightly, rising by 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. However, No. 16 and No. 59, etc., sold more aggressively, so the market weakened after the sixth period, falling back by 0.05 to 0.35 yuan. In the second round, No. 16 continued to release more, and the market price fell back across the board by 0.1 to 0.4 yuan. The trend should be optimistic based on the environment, but the market price trended weaker due to crowded longs and continuous swaps, but there was no major downside. The market price results were completely different before and after. The front rows up to the 20th closed rose from 0.05 to 0.3 yuan, while from the Unified Tax onward, they fell from 0.05 to 0.4 yuan. The total transaction amount was 19,675,000 yuan. The details of the gains and losses are listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Spun Yarn, Flower, and Sichuan Sales Recover</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell and then rose again. The yarn market was initially weak in the afternoon, but the situation remained calm. Some of the financial bulls settled their positions at market price. The political scene loosened, and market sentiment was slightly weaker. However, the market suddenly turned up in the afternoon. It was heard that the Sichuan group was developing existing yarn and purchased more than 1,000 bales of August yarn. People's hearts were shaken, the buying wind suddenly intensified, and the market became bullish.</p>
<h3>Marked Yarn Close to Good, Far Small</h3>
<p>The marked yarn market opened in the morning with a good face as cotton rose. The current month rose by 0.3 yuan. When shooting to distant months, the market loosened, and the price fell slightly as the money shop's long position closed. As a result, each month fell by 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Sichuan group had transacted more than 1,000 pieces of British factory yarn before lunch. Therefore, the market opened in the afternoon, people's hearts were stirred, and the buying wind rose even more. Each month jumped by 0.5 and 0.6 yuan. However, when shooting to the three closing prices, it turned downstream again. As the cotton market fell, the market atmosphere weakened again. As a result, each month rose by 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan. The total number of transactions for the day was 30,450 bales. It was found that 2,300 bales of Hengyi were sold, 2,300 bales of Huikang, 600 bales of Shenji, 2,900 bales of Changfeng, 450 bales of Yuanda, 450 bales of Tongji were bought, 900 bales of Suilong, 700 bales of Daji, 600 bales of Ruida, 400 bales of Renfeng, 1,150 bales of Deji, 750 bales of Xiesheng, 450 bales of Tonghe, and 450 bales of Xincheng.

<h3>Cotton, New and Old, Suffer Setbacks</h3>
<p>Ginned cotton proceeded smoothly, with the Hankou group selling short, and factories were established to reduce labor and sell excess stored cotton. The cotton market fell again, but the price of American cotton rose. Local sentiment was still difficult to stir up, and the market was still depressed. In fact, according to various news, the new cotton crop proceeded smoothly. Judging from the current situation, it was extremely satisfactory. As a result, the Hankou group sold short very actively and the market fell even further. As for old cotton, factories reduced labor too much, and news of excess stored cotton being sold by manufacturers became increasingly prevalent, so both new and old cotton tended to soften.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao Fell Back 0.3 to 0.4 Yuan</h3>
<p>Before the marked cotton market opened in the morning, most people expected an increase of several angles as American cotton rose by 21 pounds. Unexpectedly, the market price trended downward when shooting, and sellers were active in the market. According to its reasons, manufacturers sold old cotton short, and new cotton had good rainfall in all directions, the cotton crop was in very good condition. The Hankou group sold short, and the market was depressed. Each month fell by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. In the afternoon, old cotton was particularly weak, and new cotton was also weak. Each month fell again by 0.1 to 0.25 yuan. The total number of transactions for the day was 120,400 loads. It was found that 1,000 loads of Xincheng were sold, 1,200 loads of Tongji, 2,400 loads of Dafu, 5,500 loads of Dafeng, 3,000 loads of Yuanda, 3,800 loads of Jinchang, 1,400 loads of Changji, 2,900 loads of Chong'an, 1,700 loads of Yuanxingchang, 3,500 loads of Huikang, 1,200 loads of Yuande, 4,300 loads of Changfeng, and 5,000 loads of Changhe, 1,200 loads of Yuanda were bought, 1,300 loads of Yukang, 3,400 loads of Tongji, 2,700 loads of Hengyi, 2,900 loads of Gengfeng, 2,700 loads of Changhe, 3,600 loads of Junchang, 2,100 loads of Renfeng, 1,600 loads of Tonghe, and 1,500 loads of Yifeng.

<p>New Yarn Transactions</p>

If it is a machine-bundled large bag, 100 loads per load shall be used as a measurement, and two bags shall be opened to take samples of two tubes of flower, each tube weighing about two market catties. If there are two brands in one load, two more bags shall be opened and two more tubes shall be taken for separate inspection of the amount of moisture.

The cotton appraisal fee is 70 yuan per 100 loads, and 5 times, 12, 23) Omitted.</p>
<p>Grain Marked Powder Wheat Bulls Emerge</p>
<h3>Wheat Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the powder market in the morning, each month showed a trend of rising first and then falling. As foreign wheat was quoted, Chicago returned to 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan, and Canada returned to 0.1 and 0.2 yuan. Therefore, after the opening price, July, August, and September were seen to jump up, and the closing price in the previous week was expected to be about 0.2 and 0.3 yuan higher. In October and below, the market was flat. However, after the second round, because there was a part of the mainland area, and various places had received timely rain, the people's hearts were broad, and the bulls who made profits returned to the market one after another, and the quantity was very large. The Fuzao factories also sold distant months very smoothly because they had continuously received huge amounts of wheat (it was also reported that foreign wheat was approaching and the factory would fix the price, but the price of A-wheat really had to be 5.25 yuan). Therefore, between the third and fourth rounds, people's hearts were very uncertain, and July, August, and September fell back by 0.3 and 0.4 yuan compared with the initial opening. Later, the off-market bulls bought again, and the factory release became silent, so the market returned to the market again. It can be seen that off-market investors were ultimately unable to agree on foreign wheat and were intent on speculation, and the speculative intentions were becoming increasingly intense as the actual sales moved slightly. The future changes will be increasingly unpredictable. As a result, this month ended up being slightly less than 0.005 yuan, August was 0.025 yuan better, September was 0.005 yuan better, October was 0.025 yuan worse, November was 0.01 yuan worse, and December was 0.0125 yuan worse.</p>
<h3>Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market was closed in the morning. After the opening, each month showed a trend of rising first and then falling. As the foreign wheat was quoted, both Toronto and Canada returned by 0.1, 0.2 to 0.4, and 0.5 yuan. In addition, after the northern sales activity, the people's hearts remained old. When the current month's opening price, it jumped by 0.1 yuan compared with the previous week. Distant months also brought a few yuan. Soon, the bulls in the current month returned to the market, and there were actual goods sold short, so the market suddenly fell. It fell back by as much as 0.09 yuan compared with the highest price. Distant months also fell back quite quickly due to the bulls taking off. The trend is likely to be temporarily fixed, given that the drought-stricken area has received timely rain and rice prices will not be too high. As a result, the current month was only good for 0.01 yuan, August and September were 0.03 yuan worse, October and November were 0.04 yuan worse, and December was 0.06 yuan worse. In the current wheat market, prices were flat and most of the goods of the merchant were directly matched to the factory. The customer goods did not fluctuate much. The price of Kaimingguang wheat was 3.378 yuan, the price of Wuxi Baoying wheat was 3.5 yuan, the price of Jiangjiaba wheat was 3.37 yuan, the price of Wuhu wheat was another 3.09 yuan, the price of the second grade was 3.07 yuan, the price of Wangyin wheat was 3.33 yuan, the price of the second grade was 3.3 yuan, and the price of Gaoyou wheat was 3.5 yuan, and the price of the second grade was 3.33 yuan. Fuxin sold 5,000 bales and Xinda sold 1,000 bales.</p>
<h3>River Down Rice Floods In, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of each gang flooded in, with more than 40 numbers (about 6,000 stones of goods) arriving, and the people's hearts also turned discouraged. There was little movement in this street. The sellers wanted to get rid of it quickly, but they had no choice but to lower the price. At this time, although the appetite was slightly active, the customers' appetites were bagged. The Qingdao gang came forward to adopt nearly 400 bags of Qingsi late rice, but the market was decadent and lifeless, and the price plummeted, such as nearly 400 bags of late rice, but the market was decadent and lifeless, and the price of Suimeng rice fell back by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan. Duyangjian also fell by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. Only the Yinbianteng yuan was not restrained, but instead turned stable.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were twenty-eight or nine sources from all over He Xia, and the stomach of each cargo on the market was stagnant, and the market was tired of high-white粳. The price of the secondary was 0.02 or 0.03 yuan. The fresh and bright Bo Rice stood up, and the secondary was about 0.1 yuan. Early rice was also a small 0.3 yuan, and the rest of the goods also seemed tired.</p>
<h3>Ordering Foreign Rice Makes Foreigners Hesitant to Trade Indica Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreigners hesitated with Indica rice, and rumors began to spread in the market that fellow traders had ordered foreign rice. There were different opinions on the rumors. Some said that the government's tax exemption issue could be reduced by half, then the order of rice would be a fact. However, the exact number and quota were not known in detail. The hoarders in this street were deeply worried that the ordered rice was the goods that would be loaded immediately, and would arrive at the port soon. Therefore, they stood by and watched, and intended to sell at a loss. There were only 1,000 bags of Shashi brown rice sold by the Yonggang gang in the city, and the price was 6.7 yuan to 0.5 yuan. Only 600 bags of small twisted rice were opened in foreign rice, and the price was 8.35 yuan to 0.25 yuan. It was still the returned goods in this street. The price of foreign Indica rice fell by 0.2 to 0.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hankou's New Early Beans Open At 3.4 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 100 bags of the first batch of white and yellow beans from Hankou in June arrived. The goods were dry and stiff due to the drought, and the body was thin. However, the mud and ash were not heavy. The price opened at 3.4 yuan, and it was handled by the Ningbo gang. The source of Jiujiang Chengmentou was slightly connected, with a total of more than 300 bags arriving. The goods were different, and the market continued to be good due to the strong purchasing power. The route was still Ningbo and the activation of this street. Due to the rise in the oil market, the price of cake was also good, and the factory's stomach turned healthy, so the people's hearts were firm and the market price continued to rise. The total number of each truck of beans in the city was 178 trucks.</p>

<h3>Doing Essays</h3>
<p>— Shuo Er</p>
<p>Shen Kuo's "Dream Pool Essays" contains the following: "In previous years, scholars mostly favored paired phrases in their writings. Mu Xiu and Zhang Jing were the first to use plain prose, which was then called 'ancient prose.' Once, Mu and Zhang were together at court, waiting for dawn outside Donghua Gate. While discussing writing styles, they happened to see a horse running by, trampling a dog to death. Each of them recorded the event to compare their skills. Mu Xiu said, 'A horse ran wild, a yellow dog encountered its hoof and died.' Zhang Jing said, 'A dog died beneath a running horse.' At that time, the literary style was newly changing, and both of their phrases were clumsy and awkward, but they were considered skillful at the time and have been passed down to this day."</p>
<p>Parallel prose arose later. The Tang, Yu, and Three Dynasties were not parallel. Calling "plain prose" "ancient prose" is what this means. Extending from this, if the ancients truly did not separate speech from writing, then calling "vernacular writing" "ancient prose" would seem perfectly acceptable, but it differs from Mr. Lin Yutang's meaning of referring to it as "literary vernacular." The two men's works were not only clumsy, but their main points were also different. Mu said a horse trampled a dog to death, while Zhang said a dog was trampled to death by a horse. Was the emphasis on the horse or the dog? The clearer and more stable version is Shen Kuo's casual writing: "A horse ran by, trampling a dog to death."</p>
<p>Because one must exert effort to overthrow old things, and too much effort leads to "doing." Too much "doing" not only becomes "awkward" but sometimes becomes utterly "stilted and unnatural," worse than the old things that the ancients had already "done" to perfection. And things like "decorative literature," with their limitations on word count and subject matter, are especially prone to this awkwardness.</p>
<p>Too much "doing" is no good, but not "doing" is also not good. Using a section of a large tree and four small branches to make a stool would be too rough now. It must be smoothed a bit. But if the whole thing is carved with flowers and hollowed out in the middle, it becomes un-sittable and no longer a stool. Mr. Gao said that popular language is a roughcast, and literature is what is added after processing. I think this is quite an apt indication.</p>
<h3>Announcement</h3>
<p>Today, because Mr. Yi Xian's "A Travel Story" is more enjoyable when read in one go, it is temporarily replacing the long "I Come From the East." "I Come From the East" will continue publication from tomorrow onwards. We would like to clarify this to avoid disappointment among our loyal readers.</p>
<h3>The Founder of the Tongcheng School's Writing is Incomprehensible</h3>
<p>— Dun Pang</p>
<p>Literary Anecdotes from the Qing Dynasty, Part Two</p>
<p>During the idle summer heat, I borrowed "A Grand View of Unofficial History of the Qing Dynasty" from Mr. Cao Juren and perused it. It contains several literary anecdotes. Comparing them with the stories of modern writers, I found them quite interesting. Therefore, I have imitated the recent method of discussing Ming Dynasty essays, transcribing a passage and adding annotations to share with fellow enthusiasts. (The above should have been published before "Miscellanea, Part One"; this is a supplementary publication).</p>
<p>Fang Wangxi, a vice minister, styled himself as a master of ancient prose, with an attitude of unparalleled arrogance. However, Li Mutang of Linchuan looked down on him. Wangxi once showed Mutang his "Epitaph for Great-Grandfather's Tomb." Mutang returned it after reading only one line. Wangxi was very angry, saying, "Is my writing not even worth a glance?" Mutang said, "Indeed." Wangxi became even more angry and asked for an explanation. Mutang said, "There are five counties named Tong today: Tongxiang, Tonglu, Tongbai, and Tongzi, not just Tongcheng. If you omit 'cheng' from 'Tongcheng' and simply say 'Tong,' how will later generations know it refers to Tongcheng? If you do not pay attention to this, how can you talk about writing!" Wangxi remained silent for a long time, but he still refused to change it, such was his protectiveness of his errors. Wang Ruolin of Jintan once said, "Linggao treats ancient prose as contemporary prose and contemporary prose as ancient prose." Critics consider this to have deeply penetrated Wangxi's flaw. || See Mr. Zhuting's "Collected Works from the Submerged Research Hall." Zhuting was probably also dissatisfied with the Tongcheng school, wasn't he?</p>
<p>Note: In the recent debate between literary and vernacular Chinese, there was a question of "this student and that student." Who knew that Fang Bao, the founder of the Tongcheng school, had encountered a similar problem with "Our Tong" long ago? "If you do not pay attention to this, how can you talk about writing!" is truly a scathing rebuke! The proponents of today's "vernacular revival" movement can currently only produce Liang Qichao-style literary Chinese, but if they progress, they will inevitably return to the Tongcheng school. Tongcheng school. Tongcheng school's writing is actually the eight-legged essay, that is, what is called "treating contemporary prose as ancient prose." The eight-legged essay can only express empty and hollow ideas. When used to narrate actual events, it becomes incomprehensible. Fang Bao criticized Gui Youguang's writing, saying, "His language is ostensibly elegant and refined, but it still has a vulgar and verbose quality." "Vulgarity" and "verbosity" are what the Tongcheng school detested most, but today's vernacular Chinese is developing toward "vulgarity" and "verbosity." When it develops into what is called "mass language," it will be even more unbearable. Therefore, today's "vernacular revival" masters are also strongly advocating changing "this student and that student" to "this student and that student." "Elegance and refinement" is "elegance and refinement," but what use is it if it is incomprehensible!</p>

<h3>A Travel Story</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>This fable, originally published in the London "Economist" weekly, satirizes the economic nationalism prevalent in various countries around the world today. The author uses a humorous and profound style to make economic knowledge entertaining and accessible, which is indeed a clever approach. I believe that this cartoonish style is worth promoting. — Translator's Note.</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Baron Munchowsen was drinking with a few friends in a hotel. After the first glass of wine, he refilled his glass and began to tell the story of his trip to Autarkistan (Note 1):</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, before I set off for Autarkistan, it took me many weeks to find a ship owner willing to go with me. My heart had long yearned to visit this island, but I never had the opportunity to travel there before. It is located in the middle of the vast ocean, and it should be easy to reach. However, very few travelers have visited this place because any foreign ship that approaches their ports is attacked.</p>
<p>"Decades ago, Autarkistan was one of the world's most powerful commercial nations. A large amount of wealth flowed in and out of that place every year. Autarkistan's ships and goods could be seen all over the world, and Autarkistan had ready markets for goods from all countries. Later, the world war broke out, throwing the old international economic system into disarray. A nationalist movement arose in Autarkistan, with the stirring slogan 'Autarkistan for Autarkistanis!' This movement quickly gained momentum and eventually gained complete control, changing the nation's economic policies. The import of foreign goods was prohibited, with the death penalty for violators. From that day on, Autarkistan relied entirely on its own resources to build the nation. Gentlemen, this is just an introduction. Now I will tell you about what I saw in this strange country.</p>
<p>"We arrived safely on the shores of Autarkistan. On the fourth day after our departure, we saw land. The sun had just risen, and the dawn shone on the huge walls that surrounded the entire island. However, these walls were not the most noteworthy thing that caught my eye. Far more profound was the impression of the countless factory chimneys rising from behind the walls, with slogans written in large characters on them: 'Tanubohu,' which translates to 'Buy Local Goods.'</p>
<p>"However, I did not have the opportunity to closely inspect everything along the coast because a small boat had already sailed toward our ship, asking why we had come to Autarkistan. After much explanation, I finally obtained special permission to go ashore. However, I was only allowed to stay for one day, and on the condition that I strictly abide by all the customs and laws of that country. But I still hoped to find a way to extend my stay that night, so I cheerfully left the ship.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>"Our sampan quickly sailed into the harbor, which was clearly only used as an anchorage for sampans, as there was no bustling atmosphere. In the middle stood a large stone statue. It was a figure standing in a circle, looking very much like a typical old-world stockbroker. My companions, seeing that I did not pay my respects in front of it, became alarmed. They explained that this was Saint Bankruptcy (Note 2), the guardian deity of the island. They told me that he was the god of prosperity and the center of Autarkistan's religion.</p>
<p>"The most sacred decree of this religion stipulated that prices must be as high as possible—the ideal being that all prices reach a level that no one can afford—while wages are kept at the lowest possible level. This is the best way to develop the nation's economic interests. If the result of rising prices is an accumulation of commodity stocks, then these goods are sacrificed to Saint Bankruptcy, either burned in front of him or thrown into the sea around the statue. Brazil, Canada, Argentina, the United States,) (Note 3) and in order to prevent the harbor from gradually silting up, there are also very efficient dredging machines installed to carry the sacrificed goods out to sea. Every day, thousands of tons of the finest products are sacrificed to the guardian deity, which the whole country is proud of.</p>
<p>"While I was still on the ship, I was stunned by the strange appearance of the Autarkistan officials. Although the weather was cold, their clothes were made of paper, and the paper was torn and tattered. As I approached the shore, I was even more surprised to see everyone wearing these paper clothes.</p>
<p>Later, I discovered the reason. Autarkistan has no textile raw materials other than cotton. Because of an invention in 1933, this cotton is no longer used for human clothing, but as a raw material for road construction. (America) They told me that under the surface of all roads in Autarkistan, there is a two-foot-thick layer of cotton, which makes traveling even better. I thought this was absurd. However, I had promised to respect the customs of this country, so I had to remain silent. In any case, this strange practice had raised the price of cotton very high, and only a few of the wealthiest residents could afford cotton clothing.</p>
<p>Next, what caught my attention was the earth-shattering moaning of cattle. The most approachable of the officials, seeing my flustered expression, explained that so many cattle are driven to the destructor every day, where they are turned into glue in just a few minutes. They told me that about 50,000 healthy animals, some even calves, are turned into glue every month. (Holland and Denmark) "What is so much glue used for?" I asked. "How strange! Don't you know that a thick layer of glue flows within a mile around the island to prevent any foreigners from climbing over the walls?"</p>
<p>"I soon discovered that in the midst of these amazing 'defenses,' only a narrow opening a few yards wide was left. We eventually entered through this narrow opening. If any foreigner tried to break in anywhere else, he would inevitably get stuck in the glue and starve to death, like a fly on flypaper. In fact, no one has ever been caught in this way since Autarkistan was founded. However, they consider the defense of their country to be of utmost importance, and the residents are willing to sacrifice 50,000 cows every month.</p>
<p>"We had reached the shore. Because Autarkistan has no foreign trade, I could not obtain Autarkistan's currency in my own country. I immediately went to a bank to exchange some banknotes. 'What are these little pieces of colored paper?' The clerk asked. 'These are not pieces of colored paper,' I replied. 'These are banknotes, valuable banknotes, redeemable for their full value in gold.'</p>
<p>"However, my explanation was incomprehensible to him. Autarkistans no longer needed the kind of currency he had heard about in stories from his ancestors. Goods are exchanged for goods. He informed me that if I wanted something, I would have to use my ring or watch to buy it; at the same time, he kindly warned me to be very careful not to let the police see me doing this, as I might be sentenced to death for importing foreign goods. I thanked him and left.</p>
<p>"As I came out of the bank, the fragrant smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted into my nostrils, and I suddenly felt a rumbling in my stomach. It was already past eleven o'clock. I had left the ship in such a hurry that I had missed breakfast on board. So I asked the nearest policeman where the best place to drink coffee was. 'Drink coffee?' he repeated after me, looking at me as if he thought I was crazy. 'Coffee can't be drunk. It is the best feed for pigs, but of course, it is also used as a gas fuel. (Brazil) But drinking it—that's not possible. Autarkistan does not drink coffee. Even if you wanted to drink it, how could you drink it? It's not a liquid.' I felt that there was no point in arguing the issue, so I simply asked where the fresh coffee smell was coming from. He pointed to the huge chimneys I had already noticed, saying that it was coming from Autarkistan's National Revival Industry Factory. They were always seeking new ways to utilize the nation's produce. Right now, they were burning coffee, intending to increase the heat in the 'heating room,' where they had been cultivating tropical fruit trees for the past few months. This made me unable to restrain myself. 'But this must be very wasteful,' I said. 'Why don't you buy these fruit trees from the countries that have fields planted with them, and exchange them for the coffee you are now using to burn in the "heating room"? That would certainly be much cheaper.' He stood there silently for a while. Then he directly ordered me to follow him. As soon as I arrived at the nearest police station, I realized that I had violated Autarkistan's blasphemy laws and was liable to the death penalty. However, because I was the first person to visit the country in so many years, human sentiment prevailed over the law. Nevertheless, there was no question of staying on the island any longer. My ship had to leave within an hour, or I would inevitably be sacrificed in the glue zone.</p>
<p>"I walked towards the harbor. On the way, I noticed people standing outside their houses drinking from cups, and after each sip, they would kiss the wall of the house. I thought this must be some kind of ritual, but to find out, I asked a stranger. He told me that, according to an invention in 1933, adding sugar to cement makes it harden. Now, most of the sugar production is put into the cement used for building houses. (America) This method has greatly increased the demand for sugar, raising the price to a pleasingly high level, so high that the poor cannot afford to buy it and can only lick the sweetness from the walls.</p>
<p>"I was glad to leave quickly because Autarkistan's madness was constantly agitating my nerves."</p>
<p>Baron Munchowsen raised his glass, took a big gulp, and was about to continue when his friends stopped him, saying that they had never heard him tell such preposterous lies and asked him to tell them something true instead. Baron Munchowsen smiled bitterly. "Do you think I'm telling you a big lie about life in Autarkistan? Sometimes, when I tell stories, I might embellish things a bit. But believe me, gentlemen, at least today I'm telling the whole truth, and you don't believe me?" Saying this, Baron Munchowsen stood up and walked out of the hotel with a dejected face.</p>

<h3>The Child of Nature's Resistance</h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>From the "eating raw meat and drinking blood, living in caves and wild places" of ancient times to the current stage of "delicacies from land and sea," "Western cuisine," "high-rise buildings," "air conditioning"... and even trains, ships, postal services, airplanes... shortening the earth in nature by thousands or tens of thousands of times. Therefore, humanity is truly a "child of nature's resistance" (as Lancaster said), using all sorts of "ingenious" scientific inventions to change nature, utilize nature, and even conquer nature. This has created our great history of human evolution, and our greatest achievement is science, the labor of the hands of us "children of nature's resistance"!</p>
<p>Take, for example, the "natural disaster" of this severe drought and heatwave, which has affected many different countries. And the methods of saving from drought and seeking rain are also very different: like the Japanese Empire next door, based on its "martial spirit," the troops used their daily "eating utensils" cannons, to fire at the sky, to "pray for rain" for the farmers in Fukuoka, Hiroshima, Kokura, Kumamoto, and other places. Originally, to avoid the water disasters of storms, it is said that one can bombard the sky with cannons, dispersing dark clouds and preventing them from condensing into rain, which is still considered relatively reasonable and scientific, but to "seek rain" by firing cannons at the sky, although it can cause air vibrations, how will it cause the water vapor in the air to condense into liquid? This is truly a question, and can be said to be a strange tale.</p>
<p>Another country that is the opposite of Japan, the Soviet Union, is "successfully experimenting with artificial rainmaking." The method is said to be to radiate electricity into the air, so that water vapor encounters "electrons" and condenses, and "artificial" rain falls! Although it is said that this method is too uneconomical, isn't this a success of humanity's struggle with nature and conquering nature?</p>
<p>As for China! There are many reports of severe drought and heatwaves everywhere, and the situation is even more detailed. In addition to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi, and other provinces have all suffered from drought. All the news reports say, "Severe drought and heatwave, farmland cracked, disaster has already formed; urgent telegrams from various places, like snowflakes flying..." But what are our methods of saving from drought? So many! In addition to the various "rain prayer" gatherings held by those toiling and foolish people who "rely on heaven for food," and using water pumps and water dragons (fire trucks) to draw water, the most outstanding are the "rain prayer dharma meetings" held by several charitable organizations in this city, and the Panchen Lama's "setting up altars to pray for rain" in Qixia Mountain, Baohua Mountain, and other places, as well as Zhang Tianshi's "purifying the altar and issuing talismans for the rain prayer and disaster relief meeting," and so on.</p>
<p>However, I really do not know: in this "seven-day abstinence from killing," many animals are indeed fortunate enough to die a few days later, and the general toiling masses in various places who are dying daily without rescue due to the oppression of poverty, heat, and disease (are they animals?), how will our "great philanthropists" delay them for a while in these seven days? This is simply a huge question.</p>
<p>Originally, the origin of superstition (religion) lies in the fact that humans cannot find the causal laws of all the great forces and phenomena in the natural world, and thus arise feelings of terror: therefore, there is respect and awe for these phenomena, so the concept of gods arises and religion is formed. But today is the scientific age of the twentieth century! Then, we must know that religion is one of the spiritual tools of society, and our society has its many different classes, so its changes and developments naturally have its social background. Here, we must acknowledge what Han Baijun said in "Is Science Bankrupt?": "Superstition is the spiritual tool of deceivers..."</p>
<p>However, humans cannot separate themselves from the artificial environment (society) and survive alone, and this environment must constantly move forward and evolve with the progress of the times. In this way, the "child of nature's resistance" in this environment must constantly change the tools and artificial environment outside of ourselves. And humans who violate this trend will ultimately not be able to stand firm and will be overthrown by history!</p>
<h3>Summer Morning</h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>In summer, it is very sultry. The powerful sunlight shines on the earth, causing it to burn. Naturally, it is even worse inside houses. However, if it is in the morning, then! This kind of direct gift can be avoided.</p>
<p>Heat, everyone is afraid of it. The noble people, their degree of fear is perhaps even more severe. Although in their houses, there are large fans and cooling equipment, and the laborers? In terms of enjoyment, they certainly dare not make such fantasies, but in terms of suffering, there are also different differences. At least they do not have such assumptions as the noble people.</p>
<p>In the morning, if you can get up early and go to the Huangpu riverside, the water, so yellow, the boats, very light, swaying on the mirror-like water, swaying, the river waves, impacting the shore, bursting out that pleasing harmonious sound, and also, the stevedores carrying goods on the boats, that majestic humming and shouting, this, the expression of strength!</p>
<h3>Black God</h3>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Turning to the countryside, the green bushes, the green meadows, interspersed with clear blue rivers, listening to the chirping of summer insects in the light gauze mist, these will make you feel the gentleness, tranquility, and greatness of nature.</p>
<p>If, on the way home, you can stroll into the alley from the vegetable market, what you gain is even richer. The art of arranging, the art of grabbing, and even the art of scolding, can be fully appreciated here.</p>
<p>The alley is indeed a grand sight. The morning breeze sweeps the faces of the people sleeping in the open, comfortably sleeping sweetly, horizontal, vertical, male, female... although not all colors are complete, the colors and patterns are all available.</p>
<p>Like electricity, only a short glance is needed, and the precious morning will pass. However, this is what the noble people disdain to enjoy. Those who can enjoy it are still that group of laborers who are not allowed to have heat assumptions!</p>
<h3>Countryside</h3>
<p>— Shu Bai</p>
<p>From afar to the east of the house came several different sounds of gongs and drums. In this village, where there was not a sound, only a few cicadas hiding in the trees singing monotonous songs, hearing these faint sounds of gongs and drums, one could not help but feel a sense of emptiness and anxiety. This was the third and final day of the drought-ending prayer ritual, erected on the foundation of a house bombed by Japanese devils that year, by several somewhat famous Taoist priests invited from a town far away with money pooled together by the heads of the east and west villages.</p>
<p>This year, it was unknown why, but it just wouldn't rain, and the sun only radiated heat. Walking on the cracking road in straw sandals was like countless sharp thorns piercing the heart with pain. The white sap flowing from the poplar trees shone dazzlingly in the sunlight. Logically, it was currently the season of yellow plums, when there should be plenty of rain, but now, not only was there no rain, but there hadn't even been the appearance of rain.</p>
<p>People were anxious about this. They had hardly rested for several days and nights, using all their strength to try to salvage this critical situation. They stepped on waterwheels from morning, and even in the dead of night, the "splash, splash" sound of waterwheels could be heard, but the fields didn't look like they had ever been watered. In the cotton fields, only the flower branches were seen withering day by day. The rice paddies were even worse; the phenomenon of famine from several years ago was now before everyone's eyes again.</p>
<p>"Uncle, it still won't rain tomorrow, will it? Look, our fields are about to dry up and die!" The sun shone on the young man's arms, making them glisten with oil. Sweat as big as soybeans streamed down his face, and his feet stepped on the waterwheel like powerless machines.</p>
<p>"The modern world has changed, even the gods aren't effective anymore! Maybe people have sinned too much, or the heavens have blind eyes." A cloud of melancholy appeared on his haggard face.</p>
<p>"Uncle, it would have been better to save the five cents per household spent on inviting the Taoists to chant scriptures. Look, they've been messing around for three days without a drop of rain. Those devils only know how to cheat money."</p>
<p>"Alas, the world is getting worse day by day!"</p>
<p>"Uncle, aren't your two younger sisters working in a cotton mill in Shanghai, earning twenty-some dollars a month?"</p>
<p>"Alas, don't mention it. They haven't sent back a penny in the last two months. I heard they're having some kind of strike."</p>
<p>"·····················"</p>
<p>"Alas·········" As if unable to say something, he shook his head.</p>
<p>The sun had slowly begun to set in the west, and a few more sounds of gongs and drums joined in from the east of the house.</p>
<h3>A Monologue on Life</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>What exactly is life all about? I don't know. But, since people are born, why must they die? That's a riddle: I believe that this riddle will never be explained clearly, even in the distant future.</p>
<p>What is life really like? What is the meaning of life? Is life contradictory? I suspect so.</p>
<p>Recently, my thoughts have become increasingly decadent. I often come up with all sorts of inexplicable fantasies and elusive questions. Sometimes, I indulge in wild abandon, and sometimes I remain silent and don't say a word. Therefore, many people suspect that I have a mental illness, but I don't deny it. Fine, even if it's a mental illness, it's all the same, living is like a dream, not knowing what tomorrow will bring; why must I get to the bottom of things and seek my own troubles!</p>
<p>Originally, I admit that I am a pessimist. Because I am a pessimist, I feel that everything in the world is ethereal and sad.</p>
<p>Now, I don't have money to squander, nor do I have leisure to enjoy. Driven by the whip of life, I spend my days running around in the vast sea of people! Running around endlessly! This situation is really like a horse galloping, an ox plowing, and a small boat drifting, drifting, but not knowing when it will come to rest!</p>
<p>Because I value my philosophy of life too much, I live in an atmosphere of sorrow. Although I understand that excessive grief is harmful to the body, everything about me has been determined by fate. Therefore, what is placed before me in reality is all disappointment! Discouragement! And sorrow!</p>
<p>Life, economy, constantly swirls in my blurry mind. Sorrow! Annoyance constantly attacks my weak soul! The stimulation I have received is too deep; ah! Such a life!</p>
<p>I have no rosy dreams, nor beautiful memories, only an ugly, incomplete dream! Now, my only object of pursuit is money. Naturally, I love nothing but money and women. Of course, I understand that with money, anything can be done. At the same time, I also understand love; originally, young people cannot do without it. Moreover, I feel that real life is too monotonous and too depressing. Therefore, I want to pursue an ideal opposite sex to adjust my real life.</p>
<p>I believe that love is unconditional and without price; however, the facts tell me that love also requires money. It is impossible to talk about love without money. Where does someone like me, a poor scholar, get money? Because I have no money, I am still a lonely person.</p>
<p>Often, I think this way: women and money, they are both the most despicable and hateful things in the world. Many tragic events in the human world are caused by them. However, they also have times when they are honored and loved. Many happy comedies in the world are also created by them. If they didn't exist, then there would never be any boring disputes or unnecessary struggles in the world. Only then could a great, unified world truly be realized. However, people would then feel that life has no meaning. Ah! Contradictory life, when will it be able to not be contradictory? I still cannot understand, what exactly is life all about? Is it a dream? No! It is definitely not a dream; then what is it? I cannot answer.</p>
<p>The facts clearly tell me: it is useless to just fantasize and grieve. What's the use of hating life and cursing society? The environment is created by people, society is empty, and the final victory and great success still depend on one's own solid struggle! Only struggle! is the shortcut to success for us young people. We should seek a bright path from the thorny bushes of hardship and create a new life.</p>
<h3>Game Article</h3>
<p>— Chun</p>
<p>Inspired by viewing the absurd article prohibiting men and women from swimming together and walking together, I propose writing an article prohibiting men and women from sharing a bed.</p>
<p>To stem the tide when it has already turned, starting this year, to refute heresies in the face of their rising prominence, flourishing in the South, advocating the restoration of classical Chinese in the front, proposing the separation of men and women in the rear, one can foresee that the elaborate, pedantic, and polite customs of mutual deference will perhaps flourish again in our country, wouldn't that be admirable and magnificent? However, the revival of classical Chinese is ultimately a matter of avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial. Prohibiting swimming and walking is also a method of abandoning the root and pursuing the branch. To rectify the root and clear the source, it relies on prohibiting men and women from sharing a bed. Why is this? If men and women share a bed, who can stop it with propriety? How can husband and wife be as respectful as guests when sharing a pillow? In the bedroom, one cannot avoid engaging in acts of inverting the phoenix and confounding the dragon, so within society, there should naturally be more children and old men. Perhaps there are widowers on the other side of the wall, and surely there are resentful women outside the window. Thus, scaling the wall to embrace virgins and running at night to join rickshaw pullers, harming customs and corrupting morals, what could be worse than this? Moreover, walking together still has the separation of clothing, and swimming together is limited to one side, but only sharing a bed is most harmful to morality. The extreme of the ills, I fear, will be without end. Some may say that husband and wife are one of the five relationships, and maintaining ethical relationships is the ritual of the Duke of Zhou. However, if men and women can assume the guise of husband and wife and share a bed, why can't they borrow the name of friends and walk together? And since "a girl in a carriage, a girl walking along" is regarded as licentious poetry from Zheng and Wei, then how can "playing the zither in harmony, drumming and playing music" be considered a proper chapter for correcting customs? Furthermore, nourishing essence and accumulating energy can be devoted to other paths, and reducing and controlling childbirth can be devoted to national salvation work. Even if it wipes out the nation in the future, it can ultimately rectify people's hearts at this moment. I secretly suspect that the strict prohibitions that are imposed are strict on the branch but lenient on the root. I humbly offer my contribution as a commoner, to present my humble opinion, and I respectfully pray that the gentlemen of the country will adopt and implement it, then the Party and the nation will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate.</p>
<h3>Lonely Night</h3>
<p>— Miss Jiong</p>
<p>For the sake of gaining independence in life, I finally reluctantly left my warm and lovely home and helplessly ran to this unfamiliar road. Fighting bravely with the demons of hardship and suffering on this unfamiliar road!</p>
<p>As night fell, the fire-like heat gradually disappeared with the sunlight, and comfortable, cool air descended with everyone's heart's desire. The breeze blew in waves, and the summer cicadas no longer chirped endlessly on the treetops, as if everything was temporarily suspended in the surrounding silent air.</p>
<p>The leaves rubbed together, making a rustling sound, stirring up small silver ripples in the stream. The moon hung high in the sky, reflecting a silvery glow on the ground, so bright and beautifully lovely! Walking along the school gate, straight to the back door of the campus, this long runway was full of shadows; talking, laughing; and even some came up with wonderful ways to avoid the heat, pulling the mosquito nets high on the tops of the willows, laying iron beds under the trees. The curving willow branches floated from high to low, and people were shrouded inside, making slight noises, and some were singing loudly.</p>
<p>"This is ultimately a kind of indescribable desolation for strangers and lonely people!" From the depths of my heart, an incomprehensible sigh was issued!</p>
<p>The moon was exceptionally bright, and the cool temperature made one feel the preciousness of the night even more! The sound of the wind coming in from the window was loud. For this stranger, it was an inexplicable terror and fear! With a heart longing for home, I felt even more lonely stepping on this unfamiliar road. If it weren't for repeatedly drumming up the courage to fight, it would be a difficult thing!</p>
<p>The roommates were all sleeping soundly, long asleep. Trains passed one after another not far from the window, and I stared wide-eyed at the fire from the front of the train, as frightening as a giant snake. I was in such a daze, tossing and turning, feeling uneasy in this lonely night. I was on the road of loneliness, seeking the taste of life on this road?</p>

<p>Novel</p>
<h3>Return (3)</h3>
<p>— Written by Ivan Vazov of Bulgaria, translated by Yang Sen</p>
<p>Six days later, a volunteer soldier escorting Serbian prisoners, a friend of her son's, brought her a letter. The letter was written by Stoyan. She hurried to the abbot and asked him to read it to her. The letter read:</p>
<p>"I am writing this letter to tell you that I am alive and well, and that I have defeated the Serbs. Long live Bulgaria! I am fine, Lang Kuier, Stoyanov is also fine, and our cousin Dimitrios is also fine. He sends his regards to his mother. Serbia. The people bombed us with guns and cannons, but they were afraid of our shouts! Tomorrow we will pass through the mountain road of Dezengoman. When we come back, I will bring a gift for Qina from Nish. I am sending back one franc for your expenses. I will tell Raducho how to blow the shell casing. Bless you. Your filial son,</p>
<p>Stoyan, Dobrev</p>
<p>"Special greetings to father Peter, I wanted to give him a Serbian pistol, but no one was willing to send it. The Serbs transported it from afar, but they don't know how to shoot. Special greetings to Stoyanga."</p>
<p>This letter greatly cheered Zunna's worried heart. She tried her best to run to the home of Stoyanga's parents, where there was also great joy. But the happiest of all was Raducho, who was eager to know the new method his brother taught him to whistle.</p>
<p>Zunna walked to the street and saw another group of prisoners, with a Bulgarian soldier escorting them behind. Ah, what if that was Stoyan? She immediately stepped forward. But it wasn't him. She wanted to ask the soldier if he knew any news about her son, but her attention was drawn to the prisoners, because this was the first time she had seen prisoners in person.</p>
<p>"God!" she murmured. "Are these Serbians? They look like upper-class people. How unfortunate that their mothers think they have run so far! Wait a moment, children!"</p>
<p>She hurriedly ran into the house, came back with a glass of brandy in her hand, and shouted to the Serbs to wait, she was bringing them wine to drink. The Bulgarian soldier guarding the prisoners smiled and stopped his squad.</p>
<p>"Thank you, thank you," said the grateful prisoners, warming themselves with a few sips of wine.</p>
<p>"Is there a little left for me? To your health, old mother!" shouted the Bulgarian soldier, quickly draining the cup.</p>
<p>"They are also God's children. They are Christians just like us. ..." Mama Zunna thought, watching the small squad disappear into the distance.</p>

<h3>The Architecture of the New World (2)</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheney, translated by Shen Yiwu</p>
<p>Thoughts from all aspects are dominating us. Our lives are completely mixed in the movements and habits of the old and the new interacting. We are now living in a period of machine revolution. Everyone's interactions, buying, selling, working, playing, and all lifestyles are becoming mechanized. During the day, we write with fountain pens and mechanical pencils; at night, we walk with flashlights. I can wash my hands in the washbasin and tap in my room. When I go out, I can take a car. If you think the car is too slow, then you can go to a big city and take an airplane. In the United States, almost every farmer and worker has their own automobile, every elementary school student has a fountain pen and a flashlight, and no house lacks a sickroom. Every housewife uses an electric stove to cook. Living in today's scientific world, we interact with typists, telegraph operators, and radio operators. Our daily entertainment consists of phonographs, radio broadcasts, and movies. We have almost become users of machines. Our entire life has changed and is very different from the times of our ancestors.</p>
<p>However, the fact is very pessimistic. Although we are now called users of machines, 99 percent of us still live in old houses of low culture. There is no trace of machines in these houses. Health rooms, taps, and ice rooms are out of the question, and even the doors are still fitted with old-fashioned frames, and the windows are still divided into old-fashioned small squares. It is true that these houses are steeped in the stench of ancient history, and they still boast of what English style and Spanish style they are. Although everything in our lives has already been "renovated," the houses still stick to the old ways and remain unchanged, clinging to their styles as a source of pride. This is truly regrettable!</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder why they don't switch to a new, scientific method to make our lives simpler, more vibrant, and more beautiful. But I don't want to question these architects.</p>
<p>Once, I left this house of historical relics and went to another complete new building. This new building was a simplified, three-story cubic structure. There was a small alley between the office and the street. The house had machine elevators going up and down, a hall, a gallery, floors made of steel and reinforced concrete, walls made of square bricks and plaster, and metal doors and window frames. In addition, the equipment such as health rooms, stoves, washbasins, and electric lights was complete. This new building was leisurely and refreshing, completely abandoning the old styles of so-called Gothic and Greek styles. Only some patterned lines were added to the elevator doors. Everything could make people feel happy and cheerful because it was completely a machine way.</p>
<h3>Road Building Requires Laying a Foundation</h3>
<p>— Yang Yang</p>
<p>For us humans, the nutrients that make up the body are transported in the blood vessels; for countries in the world, the nutrients that make up the country are transported by roads. Therefore, if the blood vessels are not smooth, the person will be a sick man; if the roads are not repaired, the country will also be a sick country. This is undoubtedly true. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood identified road construction and canal repair as benefiting the people's travel and having the same needs as food, clothing, and housing. In the Founding Strategy, in addition to the plans for constructing railways, industries, and rivers, it was stipulated that one million miles of gravel roads should be completed nationwide. Other scattered lectures all regarded road construction as a necessary plan. Now that the country is in distress, and foreign insults are becoming more urgent, it is precisely the time for us to recuperate and teach. And the issue of road construction is currently the most important work for saving the country. How should the country work together to achieve great success? However, road construction has many aspects, and it is certainly impossible to say everything in just a few words. According to construction experts, although there are many threads to road construction, its elements are only two: one is the width of the road, and the other is the type of construction on it. The width and type cannot be specified in advance, but it is not difficult to get a general idea of the situation by closely examining the economic conditions, area, and distance of each place, and using this to measure that. There will be slight differences, so the outline of all measures can be easily solved.</p>
<p>As for the design and construction of roads, there are also two types: "solid" and "semi-solid." Solid roads are mostly paved with cement, which is very expensive, and may be difficult to do in the general inland areas of China. According to the current situation in our country and the needs of social travel, it is more appropriate to build semi-solid roads. Because the cost is not much, the effort is half and the result is doubled, so why not do it? However, there are also differences made according to the trends in various places, and it is not said that it must be so everywhere. For example, in the past ten years, major cities such as Guangzhou, Hankou, Nanjing, and Tianjin have built good "solid" roads, especially in Guangzhou, which is truly worthy of being the birthplace of the revolution! In the city of Guangzhou, the issue of public travel on the surface can be considered resolved, right?</p>
<p>"Road building requires laying a foundation." This statement seems not to have originated today, and it seems that this slogan has long existed in all previous constructions. Everything in the world comes down to one "principle," and people all over the world, ancient and modern, share the same heart and the same principle. One stroke cannot write two "principles." Therefore, regarding the saying "road building requires laying a foundation," ancient and modern, both Chinese and foreign, attach great importance to it, because the quality of the foundation determines the success or failure. The difference between good and bad, success and failure, naturally lies in the two things of excellent materials and serious engineering. The shift of these two things is generally based on the amount of cost. In other words, if you cut corners, it will naturally lead to inferiority and failure and cannot be relied upon for a long time. There are also those who cannot be blamed on the contractors, because fundamentally the economy is not sufficient, and everything is started with reluctant perfunctory efforts. Here I suddenly thought of Beijing, which is an "ancient city," it is the capital of the former Qing Dynasty, the so-called place "under the emperor's carriage." Its wide and spacious roads, although it cannot be built to a "solid" level, should also bear the name of "semi-solid," which is the reason. But unexpectedly, it is "three feet of dust in the wind, and mud on the street in the rain." This is of course the frivolity and ridicule of ordinary poets, but it is indeed not wrong in its symbolic description!</p>
<p>From now on, our construction of roads will naturally be an important measure for realizing a new China, and it cannot be delayed. However, special attention should be paid to the foundation layer! At least a "semi-solid" road should be built. A road like the "three feet of dust" and "one street of mud" is equivalent to not building it, so why bother the people and waste money?</p>
<h3>Hygiene of Residence (3)</h3>
<p>— Guo Renji</p>
<p>Preventing Cold and Heat: To prevent cold and heat, one must remove devices that hinder body temperature regulation.</p>
<p>Must Be Dry: Damp houses are unsuitable for health in both winter and summer. In summer, humid indoor air exacerbates the heat, and mold grows on walls and other surfaces, causing the air to smell moldy. In winter, humid air also feels colder because damp walls conduct heat outwards strongly, lowering the wall temperature and causing an unpleasant cold sensation by drawing away body heat, easily leading to colds, rheumatic fever, kidney disease, and other illnesses.</p>
<p>Must Be Clean: Cleanliness not only makes living pleasant but is also beneficial to health.</p>
<p>Should Have Sufficient Space: The size of the dwelling should be appropriate for the number of people living in it, with a certain degree of space per person. If it is too small, maintaining healthy indoor air becomes difficult.</p>
<p>(6) Structure of Houses</p>
<p>The structure of houses varies with climate and local conditions. In cold regions, attention must be paid to preventing cold; in hot regions, efforts must be made to avoid heat. Places with severe wind and rain also require special facilities. Houses on streets and those in the suburbs have their unique features. The same structure cannot suit all different environments. One must consider the relationship between the local climate and conditions and determine a suitable style.</p>
<p>High and Dry Land: When choosing a place to live, one must seek high and dry land. Living on muddy ground easily leads to colds and rheumatism. Furthermore, damp land tends to accumulate water, leading to mosquitoes and malaria. Flat or low-lying areas are generally damp.</p>
<p>To make land high and dry, it must be filled with clean soil to raise its elevation. Often, people fill it with soil mixed with garbage, which decomposes underground, generating harmful gases. It takes twenty to thirty years for the land to become clean.</p>
<p>In places where water is easily reached by digging, small ditches should be constructed to drain water to nearby lowlands, making the land dry. Sloping land is easier to drain and therefore drier. The direction of the slope also affects its sanitary value. A south-facing slope is good for sunlight and protection from the north wind, making it warm, while a north-facing slope is the opposite.</p>
<p>Should Have Trees: The surroundings of a house should have a reasonable number of trees, which can remove dust, provide shade in summer, and be pleasing to the eye. In windy areas, forests should be planted at a suitable distance from the house to reduce wind force.</p>
<p>Clean Land: Unclean land is a major source of infectious diseases, such as typhoid and dysentery, that enter through the mouth. The main cause of land contamination is the seepage of sewage and wastewater into the ground. These wastes often contain viruses. Therefore, preventing sewage and wastewater from entering the land is essential for maintaining its cleanliness. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on Cantonese Sound Films from the Perspective of "Mass Language" (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Tang Na</p>
<p>I wrote an article in "Daily Film" titled "Cantonese Sound Films and the Construction of Mass Language," concluding that "no matter how you look at it, dialect films – plays – literature have a decisive significance in solving the problem of mass language construction." However, Mr. Danfeng wrote in his article "The Application of Mass Language in Film" in this publication, "Currently, we strongly oppose the production of sound films with Cantonese dialogue."</p>
<p>First, it should be clarified that I have never misinterpreted the dialects and local languages of the masses as the mass language. I believe that dialect and local literature are of decisive significance in the process of mass language construction. This means that a unified national language cannot be created without certain social conditions. It is the result of the melting of highly developed dialects, and this high development of dialects is the result of the development of mass life. Dialects melt in development, which is the process of national language unification. In this sense, the national language grows naturally; but because dialects are essentially the spoken language of living people, the unification of this spoken language is a process created by a group. We grasp the process of national language unification, improve mass life and promote the development of dialects, and add a sorting effect to the melting process of dialects, which is possible and necessary. From this point of view, the unification of the national language cannot but be a purposeful movement.</p>
<p>Mr. Danfeng wants to use the language and writing of movies to help eliminate dialects and unify the language. In fact, he does not recognize that a major task of the national language unification movement at this stage is to improve dialects and local languages, and he treats movies as a panacea, as if the Cantonese masses can learn the national language with its help.</p>
<p>Looking at the "national language" of the current gentry merchants and compradores, has it not become a kind of foreign language that almost no one speaks? If the "national language" unification movement of the gentry merchants and compradores in Guangdong over the years had achieved some success in eliminating dialects and local languages, Cantonese sound films would not occupy an important position in the syllabus of filmmakers.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Danfeng's statement, promoting the national language in movies now can help eliminate dialects, but in the end, Cantonese audiences who do not understand the national language may feel as estranged and difficult to understand as watching American and British sound films without understanding English. (Of course, the difference between the lives of Americans and British people and the lives of Chinese people is much greater than the difference between the lives of Cantonese people and people from other provinces, so not understanding English will make it more difficult to understand American and British sound films.)</p>
<p>"Mass language must not be a monolithic national language, but rather a pluralistic development targeting the masses in each locality." (Gao Huang: "From Opposing Classical Chinese to Constructing Mass Language"), but the lives of the local masses are melting in development, and the language is naturally also melting in development, so I want to say, "This pluralistic development is in a direction aimed at a monolithic national language."</p>
<p>We see that Shanghainese people call "I" "Ala," which is Ningbo dialect, but because of the large proportion of Ningbo people in Shanghai's social life, it has become Shanghai's common language. This is not the result of anyone's promotion, but the result of melting.</p>
<p>Mr. Danfeng believes that if we "maintain" dialects and local languages, it will be equivalent to splitting the unity of the nation. But in fact, the language and even the socio-economic situation of the Han nationality are originally split, and Mr. Danfeng will not deny this. The unity of the nation was not split from the promotion of dialect films – dramas – literature. On the contrary, the promotion of dialect films – dramas – literature is precisely "division for unity."</p>
<p>Mr. Danfeng admits that pure Mongolian or Tibetan Miao films can be made, but it is contradictory to want to unify the not-yet-unified dialects and local languages with the help of movies. Why can't we advocate like Mr. Danfeng, with the help of movies, to unify the languages of the Han, Mongolian, Tibetan, and Miao people? True, Han and Mongolian are racial differences, and Guangdong and Hebei are only regional differences, but in fact, the difference between the languages of the north and the south is indeed like two races. Mr. Danfeng said, "For the healthy development of a free and independent nation, its language should be completely consistent to form a unified culture." However, the process of language unification is not as simple as Mr. Danfeng imagined. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3>Review of "Shoutou Wu Shounao"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Palooka – Nanjing</p>
<p>If compared with "Golden Madness," which was shown in Shanghai last time, we will never admit that this is a successful comedy. On the other hand, we also admit that there are not many parts of nonsense here. Therefore, we believe that this film is only a more successful one after all.</p>
<p>First of all, from the review of the content, at least the playwright shows that he opposes boxers from indulging in a decadent life, and the price of victory is definitely not the acquisition of honors such as "champion." After Joe fell into depression, he suddenly woke up and thought about his mistakes. This is a more active blow to the popular championship movement.</p>
<p>However, the playwright is not without wrong ideas. The main one is the same as "The Pastoral" or "The Progress of the Times," which sets the countryside and the city against each other, thinking that the city is always evil, while the countryside is simple and commendable. This cannot be understood from the economic structure, and it is what we should criticize.</p>
<p>However, let us reiterate a few sentences here on the artistic value of comedy. Whether it is comedy or tragedy, we cannot abandon the content and only criticize from the form when we observe it from the image and give it an evaluation of success or failure. Form is the decision of content, and this is what we believe. Therefore, a work with empty content, whether in literature or film, can never have its true value. And the form of comedy film art is by no means something that can be completed by superficial nonsense. Art is thinking through images. If it is only form and cannot give the appreciator something to think about, then it has lost its most important artistic component in the work. In other words, it is necessary to deeply arouse people's sympathy with successful creative skills. If the audience laughs a lot in the theater, but feels empty and nothing after leaving the theater, then this is definitely not art, but unconscious nonsense.</p>
<p>However, soft gentlemen completely ignore this basic element, and only advocate funny jokes and unreasonable troubles. This statement has already been severely criticized by people, but here we must carefully explain: we say that "Shoutou Wu Shounao" has a little success, not because they are completely based on funny jokes, but because the playwright also gave us some things in the middle. As for over-praising it as the supreme work in comedy, that is also inappropriate.</p>
<p>The director can use skillful comedy techniques to make the work very beautiful in form, which is definitely something Banjemin Stooloff deserves to be proud of. He puts most of the laughing parts on the dialogue, and he is unwilling to use the same techniques for each identical scene. For the boxing scenes, he does not directly describe them every time because they are tense and exciting, but instead uses sound to express them in some places, so that a major boxing match is the only climax. These places show that he is not mediocre. And the economical editing, not wasting the so-called great scenes, should also be his advantage.</p>
<p>Jamie Dulong's acting skills are really not worthy of praise. What Cheng Bugao said at the Qingnian Hui film lecture, "exaggerating to the point of not being a human action," can be applied to Jamie Dulong. Although we admit that comedy needs to be exaggerated, if it is too much and loses the sense of reality, it will be lost instead: the effect of his exaggeration. A considerable degree of exaggeration is needed in comedy to make it a more real than real expression, which vulgar actors will not understand. It is very fortunate that Jamie Dulong can do it here to the extent that he does not make people hate him.</p>
<p>Stuart Erwin played the best, followed by Luo Fanli, who was also okay. All the others are competent. Audience opinion.</p>
<h3>Review of "Sacrifice for Whom"</h3>
<p>— Yu Hong</p>
<p>This is a war history of the Volunteer Army against Japan. In today's national crisis and unreclaimed land, it is very likely to attract the attention of some audiences. However, due to the director's lack of skill and the incorrect subject matter, not only is there no tense plot, but except for the two war "toppings" at the beginning and end, it is simply a flat picture without the slightest excitement or climax. It is even inferior to the "Orphan Army" with the same story last year.</p>
<p>Indeed, under the pressure of this layer upon layer of environment, we can also understand the author's painstaking efforts, but since the author has marked the banner of anti-Japanese war, at the very least, the audience should be given a strong stimulation within the possible range. The audience should not avoid the great reality, but specialize in depicting the Volunteer Army's boring deeds of infighting for jealousy. This is the point we feel most painful about.</p>
<p>In terms of the plot, there are many contradictions, especially the confession of the female spy. Although the author believes that it is the victory of the supremacy of love, he does not know that it has indeed missed the climax of the film and eliminated the great significance of the whole play. As for the editing of the second half, it is even more chaotic. For example, the scenes of Lu Zhen's return from a business trip and Xiu Hua's contact with Zong Han are completely conflicting and contradictory in time and interjection.</p>
<p>However, there is also a barely satisfactory shot, which is the scene of Wen Qi's heartbreak and self-harm in the lake. In this film, it is the most beautiful painting. As for the rest of the expressions, scenery, light, and subtitles, they are not worth mentioning.</p>

<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>20th Century Limited (5)</h3>
<p>— Wen Yin</p>
<p>The train was rushing forward desperately in the dark night. No matter what it encountered... fire, flood, or snowstorm... the 20th Century Limited had never been late to New York. Fire, flood, snowstorm, the conductor said bitterly, are very suitable for this passenger, because on this train, in addition to a crazy theater manager who insisted on telling the conductor to stop the train to throw down a young man who was accompanying an equally crazy movie star, there was also a real madman who was posting religious slogans everywhere: "Repent! The time has come!" The slips were found one by one, on the walls, on the guests' hats, and even on the boxes where the palace servants ate in the dining car, all pasted with such notes for no reason, making everyone surprised. Later, the madman was caught on the spot by the conductor. The conductor asked him, "What is your name?" The old Japanese man looked up at the conductor and smiled helplessly, "This makes me ashamed and unable to explain. Let me compensate for how much everyone has lost. My name is Ma Ji Clark, the general manager of Rakuso Bakuso Medicinal Cake Factory." The conductor said to him sternly, "I have already received a telegram about you." Clark asked timidly, "Did my nephew send it?" The conductor nodded. Clark asked again, "Did he say that I have a mental illness, but there is no danger, and that he will pick me up in Cleveland, etc.!" The conductor took out the telegram again to take a look, and then said, "That's right. But there is one more sentence, he tells you not to accept your check. Do you know you almost caused a disaster. Your "The time has come!" scared the passengers to death. They thought the train was going to derail." The conductor and the tea boy searched him and confiscated the remaining slogans. Clark held his head and shouted, "That's terrible. I'm really sorry." The conductor said, "Go back to your room. We will take care of you." So the old man shook his head and walked to his room.</p>
<p>His shape is crazy and silly, but there is no danger, and there are people on the train who are even more crazy than him. The movie star is now locking the door, playing a half-human, half-goat monster. Lilian was also screaming in the room, trying to convince George Smith that she had nothing to do with Oscar Gifford. She was pacing in the room. She said, "I can't stand it anymore! You kind of person - you are so suspicious!" George said to her harshly, "Then why did you lie to me?" Lilian shouted, "Lie to you? Why don't you let me be at peace? You fool! You madman! Don't hammer me with a hammer, okay?" She suddenly seemed to be unable to bear it anymore. He yelled wildly, and he fell into the chair. George immediately knelt down and comforted her softly, "Why didn't you scream like this earlier? If you didn't scream, I wouldn't believe you. I'm so ashamed of being so suspicious of you. Lilian, I love you!" Lilian then screamed again: "Baby······Baby······Baby······Mom likes you!" She looked up at her performance from the mirror on the opposite wall, which was so effective! That kind of benevolent smile, like a little mother, but so young and beautiful! George also shouted softly in Lilian's ear as if he was flattered: "Baby also loves Mommy. Are you happy?" Lilian said, "Very happy!" But her eyes were about to ache from looking at him and at the mirror on the opposite wall. She said to George, "Please let me be alone for a while!" (To be continued)</p>
