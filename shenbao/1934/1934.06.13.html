<h3 id="c23">最近歐洲時局之變化 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>近數日來。歐陸情勢。因軍縮主幹會之召開。頓形緊張。先之以德法之對立。繼之以英法之齟齬。其情狀之可懼。誠有類於一九一四年大戰之前夜。然曾不多時。英法卽握手言歡。重復表示合作。遂使命垂旦。夕之軍縮會得存一。綫之希望。而法德之惡化關係亦稍見轉機。據最近歐電。除英法重謀合作外。意相墨索里尼。亦挺身而出。謀與德法當局。求一解决途徑。同時小恊約之承認蘇俄。亦告成立。時局變化之速。出入意表。然歐洲各國之所以懸崖勒馬。不欲急遽造成二次大戰者。亦自有故。其可得而言者。約有數端。</p>
<p>（一）法國對德。向挾英國以自重。若失英國之同情。其力卽難以制德。惟自大戰以還。法强德弱。因是英於二國之間。常抑法助德。卽至希脫拉上台之後。英之態度。仍復如是。英法意見之所以日益枘　。法俄關係之所以日益接近。其關鍵胥在於是。假使英之對法。能稍示讓步。則法寗保持英國之好感。蓋英能與法合作則法之獲利。不僅在歐洲。卽其遠東之地位。亦可賴以維持。爲法衡量情勢。設失一英而得一俄。在歐陸固可以制德。然其遠東之安南。卽難免不受日本威脅之虞。法人於此。慮之甚深。故於軍縮會中。雖與俄人聲氣相投。然其態度。亦殊圓活。一待美代表之斡旋。亦卽對英表示讓步。通過重邀德國之折衷案。其不欲因得俄而失英。意甚明顯。</p>
<p>（二）法俄之結合。果成事實。則英之處境。必甚困難。蓋李維諾夫之主張。一在訂立互助公約。二在規定侵略界說。三在實力制裁侵略國家。其意顯欲德國於侵俄或攻法時。使英國受其約束。以爲反德之戰。設此種公約。擴而推行於遠東。則一遇日俄戰爭。英國又負制裁日本之責。凡此皆使英國政策。受制於人。失去其臨機應變因時取利之機者也。且法俄果成集。團而與日德之集團。交相火併。在歐洲英固不願助法俄以戰德。在遠東亦必不屑爲俄而敵日。故英國自爲計。實不利於法俄之密切合作。今次軍縮會上。英人所以能捐除意見。力挽大局。重與法國携手者。蓋欲法國稍疏對俄之關係。勿使蘇俄之主張。得以全般實現耳。</p>
<p>（三）墨索里尼　　虎視。沈機觀變。無時不思利用法德之矛盾。英法之隔閡。擴張其意奥匈結合以來之集團外交。今墨氏果乘軍縮僵局之機會。挺身而出。遍邀雙方負責當局。赴意會商。此舉雖藉名調解。然難保不别有用意。或欲羅致德國。擴大已成之集團。亦未可知。更觀法外長不欲赴意之表示。殆法人於此。已有戒心。若此種推測而非大謬。則今日小恊約承認蘇俄之急轉直下。非無故矣。蓋奥匈與小恊約。利害本極剌謬。自意奥匈結合以來。所以尙能相安者。端在意德兩國。猜嫌未釋耳。設今墨氏與希脫拉之會見。結果圓滿。則所加於小恊約與法國之威脅。必遠出於德奥合併之Ｌ。今日法國之所以旣欲聯俄又不忍失歡於英者。於此當不無關係焉。</p>
<p>歐洲之局面。旣複雜如此。遠東之利害。各國觀點。又不同如彼。於此情態之下。法國對俄之關係。自不能不適可而止。苟不至於絶望。必以保持英國友誼爲要着。唯爲厚植國際勢力計。必仍引蘇俄以自重。此其一。英法之合作。苟能繼續。則國聯自必尙能存在。軍縮談判。亦儘有峯回路轉之餘地。歐洲戰禍之爆發。當可因以延緩。此其二。至於德國。假使加入意奥匈之集團。爲德設想。出。</p>
<p>路亦殊少。今日德國之要求。固在重整軍備。然重整軍備之目的。必在謀失地之收回與領土之擴張。於此德人。果將若何對付法國耶以吾人所見。德之與法。實力過於懸殊。當不致輕易啓釁。對於波蘭。則方訂十年不侵條約。自不致卽時反臉惟波羅的海諸國。國小力弱。侵入不難。其中立陶宛。尤爲德人之目標。故一旦日俄有事。德國乘機東出。以作侵略蘇俄之舉。亦非不可能之事。今日蘇俄之所以亟與法聯謀訂東歐不侵公約。蓋欲先發制人。使德不能乘人之危以圖利也。以李維諾夫外交手腕之　活。蘇俄此種企圖。殆有成功希望。故日俄戰端。苟不卽時爆發。蘇俄儘有從容應付之餘暇。如是則德之出路。仍必無法打開此其三。縱觀此種相互牽製之關係。可知歐洲之時局。雖極緊張。尙不致立起戰爭。惟若認爲歐局卽有和平氣象。亦未免過於樂觀矣。</p>

<p>（華盛頓）今日據可靠方面消息、明年海軍軍縮會議英國或將要求限制海軍軍用飛機云、英國對此重要問題、迄未具體說明其地位、美對此事聞將予以反對、美國海軍官員堅稱、空軍飛越重洋轟炸敵國都市之說、未免言過其實、蓋以接近攻擊地點須有廣大根據地、更須戰艦保護方能成功也、日美兩國海軍當局現正籌措新欵以充實海防空軍、而英國則任其空軍落伍、今日遂退列第四或第五位、英曾切望軍縮會議限制軍用飛機、軍縮總委員會現已指派一特别委員會、研究此事、此間公正之觀察者以爲民用飛機甚易改作軍用、此爲管理海軍軍用飛機之困難處云、商用飛機塲亦可改作軍用機塲、因此代管島及阿留申羣島設置空軍根據地將引起太平洋之不安、據稱代管島已有幾處開始建造商用飛機塲而阿留申羣島之根據地正在考慮中云、（十一日國民電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）晚報說明意國所以建造三萬五千噸鐵甲巡洋艦兩艘之理由、謂意大利原有建造兩艦之權利、所以迄未動工者、爲顧全軍縮會議耳、今不獨日内瓦之軍縮會議一無所成、卽華盛頓之海軍條約亦已破產、歷届海軍會議之結果、不惟不能排除各簽字國間互相猜疑及競爭之因素、且各國海軍反因之增加、蓋海軍會議、原以英國海軍爲最大限度、認爲不能超過、不料日本海軍原不及英國、自海軍會議之後、逐漸增加、竟與英國等量齊觀矣云云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）官塲對意大利建造三萬五千噸鐵甲巡洋艦兩艘一事、極爲注意、一般人以爲倫敦限制海軍條約、意大利並未簽字、故有權建造大噸數之軍艦、任何人對於此事、並無異議、惟一般意見、以爲意大利所行者、如係一種新造艦政策之開始、則英國對於一九三五年海軍會議初步談判之凖預計畫、或將因之大爲修改、而英國在海軍會議初步談判以前、及談判中所擬採之政策、將因意大利新政策而受相當影響、第意大利造艦計畫、直接影響之國家、厥惟法國、蓋一九三零年倫敦海軍條約、法國政府所以未能承認者、卽因意大利要求與法國海軍平等、此次意大利造艦計畫、卽爲海軍平等問題之重行提起云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>歐洲的政局、在此軍縮會議未有結果·國際聯盟毫無生氣的時候、德法兩國間對立、愈見明顯、局勢遂越見尖銳化了德國的人民、頗認定德人不能裸身以當武裝敵之說法、所以她退出軍縮會退出國聯、以示其堅决、至於德國國内的情勢、當希特勒去年一月剛秉政的時候、失業工人數額、差不多占全體工人的三分之一、實數在六百萬人以上、去年年底祇有四百萬、本年一二月、就季節關係而論是應該增加、但事實上一月爲三百七十七萬四千人、二月爲三百三十七萬四千人、三月减少到二百八十萬人、四月底又减少了十九萬一千人、而爲二百六十萬九千人了、比較去年、是很明顯的改善了、</p>
<p>但是這種數字、祇是以有失業保險與接受其他救濟的人爲限、除此以外、未經登記的失業者、至少還有一百五十萬、若問其改善的原因、據官方說、是减少工作時間、緊急的土木工事、與夫廢止婦女工人、將她們引回廚房裏去等等、這固然有多少效力、而在實際上、還該以下述的事情爲最主要原因、這就是軍事豫算的擴張、和軍需工業的勃興、</p>
<p>（一）一九三四年度國防部所轄的豫算、合計起來、有八萬萬九千萬馬克、其中陸軍占六萬萬五千四百萬馬克、海軍占二萬萬三千六百萬馬克、此外航空部還有二萬萬一千萬馬克、突擊隊和志願勞動的補助費、有二萬萬五千萬馬克、這都可以當作國防費的、共計有十三萬萬五千馬克、</p>
<p>（二）國防部擔任全德意志的工業動員之指導工作、建設新工塲、整備舊機械、戰時工業活動、已經再開了、這事情由去年底柏林證劵市塲上、凡軍需工業股票一齊上漲、可作證明、再則德國對外貿易統計、軍需工業原料的輸入、激劇增加、而製造品的輸出、則突然减少了、如萊茵墨塔爾克魯伯·莫塞爾·柏林·加爾色爾葉·等工業、以及柴斯·吉門斯·等軍需品工廠、易格染料廠的毒瓦斯工廠、巴葉倫等發動機製造廠、都大大的增加工人、</p>
<p>這樣情形、在戰後疲敝達於極點的德意志、外受凡爾塞和約的束縛、内感財政經濟的困乏、要編成强有力的軍隊、是很困難的事、可是她還是毫不退縮、努力奮勉着向前求進步、</p>
<p>德國的陸軍、由凡爾塞和約規定祇准有十萬人、但這十萬人、都是優秀的幹部將校、而志願來當兵的人、約十倍於選額、所以軍的價値很高、這個軍組織雖新、但完全是舊軍傳統的繼承、其團結以興登堡總統爲中心、對舊德皇誓忠誠的人、固不很多、而封建的意味、却很濃厚、凡是與共產黨有關係的、很不容易選進去、</p>
<p>德國對法國·和波蘭·本來敵意很深、所以與蘇聯很接近、最近德蘇關係、已經惡化、而她受赤軍的影響、依然不少、如在編制裝備上、在戰術思想上、在敎育訓練上、都還存留着這種因素、而國防部的軍務局、與戰前的參謀部的性質差不多、職權也相似、并且借此養成其所需要的將校、</p>
<p>陸軍的數目、在編制上沒有大變化、但裝備却是加强了、人員也由十萬增加到十六萬五千、曾經過訓練的在鄕軍人、也有十萬、還有十五萬警察、可作補助軍隊、而國社黨所屬的ＳＡＳＳ突擊隊、完全是軍隊的組織、一部分且備武裝、受過訓練的人數、在百萬以上、海軍有她的懐中袖珍軍艦、空軍也凖備着五個爆炸機中隊、十個到十二個戰鬭機中隊、總之德國是正在積極於軍事的建設、法蘭西目擊其軍事如此擴張、自然更要加速度的完成其空軍擴張計劃、以警戒德國的報復、因此兩國間形勢、又緊張起來、（五月一日於柏林）</p>

<p>又據川康軍總部所接康北前綫報告藏方近况、謂藏中現分三大派、一曰縣政府派、熱振呼圖克及噶厦等屬之、其主幹爲達賴之徒衆、主張繼續維持現在政權、一曰舊派、又稱親中派、主張歡迎班禪回藏、主持政治大權、一曰靑年派、其中多留英學生、故有親英派之名、主張造成西藏獨立的地位、駐防康邊之藏軍各代表、多係此派、</p>
<p>黃慕松日前在雅安動身入康時、曾致電西藏現當局、表示解决西藏問題、須由宗敎入手、再從宗敎上以推動政治、除國防外交及關係國際上之重大交涉、由中央直接辦理外、其餘各事、俱由西藏政府自行處理、至關於開發西藏及藏中敎育交通等事、中央更以財力與人力相助、並歡迎西藏靑年入内地留學、以打通漢藏兩民族之感情、至於拉薩三大寺、在前淸所領之津貼、均一律恢復、由中央照撥云云、聞西藏政府對於黃氏入康、異常欣慰、並已派大員到昌都迎候、</p>

<p>— 千家駒</p>
<p>鬱林土布爲什麽能存在呢，這是値得我們考究的，在桂林是靠着湖南佬蠻幹的精神，這裏却憑　商人資本巧妙的剥削方式，在這兒織布的多是本地人，但鬱林（以及平南一帶）有一）</p>
<p>種特殊的發紗制度與以紗換布制，鬱林約莫有三十家土布行，他們有的發紗給織户，有的以紗換布，以紗發給織户的，大都預先把紗線牽在機頭上，每機頭用紗一股，可織成三尺七長一尺七寛之布　二疋，發給工資銅元百八十枚或三百枚，三百枚銅元以當地洋價折合約一元四五角錢，但十疋布要織多少天呢，最勤快的也須十二天，手脚遲鈍的便要半來個月，半個來月才能賺一元四五角錢，這實在是不够維持最低限度的生活的，另外一種制度是以紗換布，通常是平換，最好的也是以二斤布換　斤　兩紗，工錢是不給的，平換（卽二斤布換二斤紗）爲什麽也有織户肯幹呢，原來紗織成布後，照例要加漿水，才能硬挺，通常每一斤布有終　兩米漿，所以雖說是平換，但　斤布裏面有三四兩漿水，而二斤紗却是無漿紗，織户就靠這米漿中賺下幾兩紗來，這就是他們勞動的唯一代價，但米漿也是要錢的，所以以紗換布比發紗制度更要悲慘，而同時紗店對所織的布挑剔甚嚴，尺寸或分量較爲差次，便藉辭拒絶，織户祇有含淚忍受一切苛刻的條件，我們自已便不止一次目擊這種情形，這種慘酷的血汗制度，（ＳｗｅａｌｌｎｇＳｙｓｔｅｍ）是祇有封建經濟占着優勢的中國才能存在的，這實實在在是比馬克思在資本論第　卷中所描摹的英國廠主剥削工人還要可怕的材料，但鬱林的紗商經由這樣的剥削，應該獲得很大的利潤，而事實上據我們的計算却也是極其可憐的，鬱林土布凡長十五碼寛一尺七的色柳條布售價是二元二三毛，一疋，織成一疋布的成本，約須二十支的紗四支又三分之二，二十支紗當地市價爲二百八十八元一包，每支價値三角六分，再加上研工，牽紗工，顏料，紙料等等，每疋約須洋五角，合爲二元一角餘，由此可知每疋布至多也不過賺一二毛錢而已，這裏又再度的證明當資本主義商品侵入到中國的窮鄕僻壤後，中國土著的家庭工業卽不陷于全部破產，也祇有在這樣悲慘的環境下度其殘生而已，</p>
<p>鬱林的辛定村（離城約十里）是織布業的中心區域之一，這裏有一位李澤濃先生，是値得我們特别紀述的，這位李先生（鄕人稱他爲李十四師）不曾進過學校，不曾讀過機械工程科，但也積了二十多年的經騐，自動地發明了一種織機，這種織機能同時織燈心帶十六條至二十四條，據他自已說，如放大起來，可同時織布三疋，這種機是木製的，參雜有簡單的機械原理，一面織帶，一面還能紡紗，一個人祇消用脚在底下踏，無須乎手的動作，據他自已談發明該機的經過說，一宣統年間，本人才第一次看見有鐵造的打手巾機輸進本地，後因手巾不合時宜，而致爲織布，（民七八年時）至民二十一年，因布的銷路也不大好，所以改爲織帶，最初每機僅織二條，以後增爲四條，自四條而八條，十二條，以至今日之十六條，將來不難改爲織二十四條，這種機祇要用脚發動，所以可改用水力，可惜目前還沒有這種機會，但李先生不肯將這種機傳授給别人，家裏也禁止一切的人去參觀，他生怕别人學會了，將使他喪失了這種專利的機會，（現在他用這種自已發明的機織帶，每一壚丨三日丨可以賺六元錢），我們因爲得有朋友介紹，才去看了一下，其實織機的構成也極簡單，不過是三架單純作業機的合成吧了，我們說，不幸李君生在二十世紀的中國，如果生在十八世紀的英國，ｊａｍｅｓＨａｒｇｓａｖｅｓ或理髮匠ＲｓｃｈａｒｄＡｒｋｗｒｉｇｈｔ的地位，又何嘗不是這樣造就的呢，然而他也幸而生在邊僻的廣西，如果是在機器工業發達的上海或天津的話，這種簡單的機械，也决計不能使他每天有二元錢的純益的，</p>
<p>鬱林的船埠爲通廣東北海屬的樞紐，亦是鹽米聚散之地，鬱林一帶的米都經船埠運銷廣東，而鹽則自粤之欽廉經由船埠入桂，這裏也是商人資本最活躍的地方，特别是鬱林屬幾縣的米都聚集在這兒，船埠總共有十多間谷米收屯舖（民十四五有三十餘家）其中收米最多的每年要收屯，二百萬斤，少的亦收數十萬斤，收買最多的時期約當陰歷十月，這正是晚稻收穫的時光，每担谷價約當五元，但一到了次年四月這正是靑黃不接的時期，便漲到十元一担了所以鬱林有句俗諺，「窮人　平谷，吃貴米，」這當然不僅鬱林如此，我們不過舉其，例吧了，</p>
<p>離鬱林三十里路的福棉村，是鬱林又一著名的土布區，因何得名「福棉」，雖不能確知，但這憂當光緒末年時，種有多量棉花，却是該處父老類能道之的事實，據說是時有廣東人在北流收買棉花製成一尺來長，手指粗細的棉條，將棉條賣給農民紡成細紗，當時廣西人就用這種土紗織成土布，但自洋紗入口後，此地的棉花再就沒有人收買，而種棉花的人也一天天减少，「福棉之名」，不副其實了，以前，這裏的花生也種植得極多，而自煤油入口後，花生製成的生油沒有銷路，所以花生的出產也隨之减少，（現在改種蓬頭花生，形小而胖，非復舊觀）由這兩件事實看來，資本主義廉價商品給予中國農村的影響，可想見了，</p>
<p>離開了鬱林，我們便出發到貴縣，貴縣位處西江中游，乃　梧水陸交通必經之道，除　梧快輪打此經過外，尙有拖渡多艘航行貴梧之間，這種拖船面積寛大，吃水不深，本身建造與民船無異，祇消前用一小汽油船在前拖着，便可行駛，速率可與汽船相等，這是桂省貨運的利器，所以貴縣在航運上是很重要的一個轉運碼頭鄰近各縣的貨物都來此集中，運銷到梧州去，由梧州上來的貨物也經由貴縣而分散内地，同時貴縣又是產糖很著名的區域，牲口運出的亦不少，由于這種種原因，使貴縣的金融特别活動，同時又成爲一個出超的縣份，這在廣西，亦可說是不多見的縣份，在貴縣我們祇住了一晚，第二天便出發到賓陽，</p>

<p>上年倉庫九十五所儲押數一百三十萬元</p>
<p>本年擬擴充至二百所預計儲押三百萬元</p>
<p>近年來農村經濟、凋敝已極、各方面咸注意於農業倉庫之舉辦、以備儲押農產品、江蘇省農民銀行辦理五年、平日對於儲押事業、極爲注意、成績頗有進展、本年麥豆登塲、雖據稱有豐收之望、但麥價下落、可以預料、同時稻收以後、價格亦必有自然跌落之趨勢、故倉庫之具有成績者、故特往該行探詢辦理倉庫儲押情形、茲錄如左、以爲留心農村經濟者之參考、</p>

<p>大公社云、中國銀行總經理張公權氏、爲謀開發内地富源、流通農村經濟、以及發展實業起見、特於上月間、偕同該行經濟研究組主任張肖梅女士、及該行副經理史久鰲等、遠赴川省實地考察、並視察該行四川分行行務、歷時一月有餘、始於前日乘輪返滬、大公社記者、昨日下午、特赴中國銀行探訪者綦衆、故致無暇接見、特囑該行吉秘書轉告記者、略稱、張總理之意、擬於一二日内自草一文、俾將此次考察所得、供獻各界、旋記者復請見隨張氏赴川之經濟研究組主任張肖梅女士、當承延見、茲誌其發表之川行觀感如下、</p>

<p>據張肖梅女士稱、此次張總經理及本人赴川之任務、雖爲考察内地實業、然亦係視察各地分行、蓋川中分行、成立於茲、已有二十餘年之歷史、因政局上之種種關係、素少與總行聯絡、刻下川中軍事、已告一段落、二十一年已成統一之局、故特赴川一行視察分行最近狀况、俾稍加以整理、</p>
<h3 id="c110">生產落後貨物入超 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>川省號稱天府、富甲天下、藴藏豐厚、本可不仰給外貨、土地肥沃、可種植各種農產、如果政局澄淸、又何致民不聊生、惜乎過去因軍閥各爭地盤、連年戰禍不絶、以致兵匪遍地、農村破產、年來更因產業落後、運出之貨物漸减、輸入之貨物日增、出超之省、一變而爲入超之省、同人等入川之時適爲該省當局舉行生產會議、討論救濟辦法之際、惟此種救濟辦法、　於一隅、未能通盤籌劃、其成效恐亦微乎其微、同人等到達時、該會業將閉幕、故未克參加、但川省軍政當局、則悉於此時會面云、</p>
<h3 id="c111">政治軍事漸趨統一 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>川省主席劉輔臣先生、人極精明幹練、對地方上建設、亦極努力、惜乎未出　門一步、鮮與外界聯絡、對世界潮流所趨、不免隔閡卽中國全國情形、似亦稍欠明瞭、財政廳長唐棣之先生、對於整理川省財政、亦極關心、現在尙未克與中央統一者、實緣地方制度上有種種窒礙之處耳、惟政治已漸上軌道、而軍事亦漸見統一、此亦爲川省之一種好現象也、</p>
<h3 id="c112">苛捐繁重幣制紊亂 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>川省養兵之多、冠於各省因之財政當局、不得不增加苛捐雜稅以應付此浩大之軍費、馴至產業家不勝負擔、而相率停業、投資者亦競相　足、造成洋貨進口之機會、璧如牙刷一打、從前納稅三分、今則增至二角、於此已可槪見其重稅之一斑、再者幣制紊亂、幾無與比倫、銅元之使用、甚至易地換種、人民之痛苦、無可言喻、惟幣制與金融界息息相關、金融界亟應恊助加以改革使消弭地方上之惡習云、</p>

<p>川省氣候溫和、出產豐富、卽以自流井之鹽、内江之蔗糖嘉定之白蠟與蠶絲每年出產、已無可限量、惜乎墨守陳法、不知改良、乃致原料虚耗、出產减小、自流井製鹽之法、係用人工掘土數尺、將大竹管　空、吸取鹽質、並不用日光曝囇、再掘地極深、待煤氣湧出燃之以火、卽賴煤氣蒸乾、蓋該處地下、均藴藏極富之煤質也又如内江甘蔗製糖、係用牛驢磨碎成汁、然後用柴煎糖、用機器製造者、竟如鳳毛麟角、窮一日夜之人工尙未克抵機器二十分鐘之力、殊可惜也、又如桐油一項、亦爲川中極巨之出產、從前以宜昌爲薈市之地、由中原公司獨家經營、近亦宣告失敗、而川中礦煤藴藏之多、亦屬極大富源、此刻尙無人加以開採以致貨棄於地云、</p>

<p>至於外傳張總經理赴川目的、係研究投資之目標此說、現尙談不到此、蓋中國銀行之投資、爲本身利益計、向不直接經營、須視各地方之政治、是否已上軌道、而地方當局之是否能予以誠意合作、爲最重要之關鍵、如果政治不入常軌假使有人在内地設一極大工廠、而被科以極重之稅則、試問企業家於此種情形之下、是否尙敢投資耶、故中行對川省投資、現尙未能確定、</p>

<p>吾國以農立國、而農村之主要產品、則爲米·穀·豆·麥·雜糧·蠶絲·棉花·豆餅等類、蘇省位居東海之濱、長江横貫中部、種河縱流南北、水利之富、遠勝他省、故此類物產、尤稱饒富、祇以價格慘跌、農村日趨破產、該行對於蘇省所屬各縣農產、米穀豆·麥·土絲·豆餅·棉花·等類、無不盡量儲押、統計該行各分行自辦及委託代辦之各倉庫、現在所儲押之農產品、以米穀爲最多、次爲豆·麥·豆餅·棉花·土絲等、本年儲押數量、計米穀約二十五萬石、麥約三萬石、豆約三萬石、棉約二萬石、豆餅約十萬片、又二萬餘石、絲約八千餘石、雜糧約一萬餘石、肥田粉約一千五百石、布約三萬疋、</p>

<p>本報自由談上曾載過一篇高爾基著的「給兒童讀些什麽書」，其中有一段是這樣寫着：</p>
<p>「科學與發明，不應當寫成一篇現成的發見與發明底總賬，應當寫成人類與物質阻力及傳統思想搏擊的戰塲。此類書籍的編者。應該是研究有素的科學家，不應該是東抄西襲的編書匠；要有眞正的科學家和才具高超的作家底合作，我們才能從事出版以藝術手腕傳佈科學知識的書籍。」</p>
<p>徐克君在看完了這段話之後，向我們提出了如下的兩個疑問：</p>
<p>（一）任何學科必有其關聯的科目，例如：生理學家在著述生理學時，勢不得不參考解剖學，這怎樣去避免東抄西襲之嫌呢？</p>
<p>（二）把一種名著編成通俗本，這與東抄西龔有什麽分别？</p>
<p>我們接受徐君的疑問，對於抄襲，提出一點正確的解釋，因爲這於讀者，在鑒别一本書的好壞時，甚至編寫一本著作時，是有多少帮助的。</p>
<p>根據徐君所提出的問題，我們覺得徐君不僅對於高爾基的那段話，沒有十分瞭解，卽對於「抄襲」二字的意思，也似乎不甚明白。</p>
<p>抄襲，是指作者把别人的文章生呑活吐地作爲自已的文章。抄襲與引用是不同的，引用，是坦白地引用别人的話，來證明自已的立論，而抄襲則在作者的態度上，旣是那麽曖昧，不把原文的作者及出處注明，且自已行文，也沒有固定的見解，專只拿别人用慣的辭句來做粉飾。一個生理學家，在著述生理學時，如果要參用解剖學，那他旣應該毫不掩飾的指出原文的出處，尤其是應該使所引用的文句，不是凑數的東西，是在自已文章的整個系統下，成爲補足意見的東西，或者恰恰是自已所要寫的東西。這樣，顯明的，不是抄襲而是引用了。凡是「文抄公」，均可稱之爲「小竊」。他是抱定「到手便是財」的見解的。信手偷來，有時固可摸到一二件眞的寳物，但有時也會把「狗屎當成寳」看。他自已雖沒有鑒别財貨的識力，却毫無疑問地靠着「偷竊」活命。以前考「八股」時的文人，拿手好戲便是這一套。記得有一個笑話，是形容一般「文抄公」的。其童生，於進考塲前，把預備好了的許多寫成蠅頭小楷的「夾帶」，塞在小毛筆桿内。臨考時，試題一出，他便從毛筆桿内拿出他的寳貨，恰巧那堆寳貨中，又有恰如其題的那麽一篇，得意之下，一手抄成，自然以爲「高中」無疑了。那知命運乖張，夾帶的文字是省寫，我們的文抄公，誤把「起講」開首的二個字昔賢（賢字省寫爲　）寫成「二十一日上天」（廿一日　）於是，主考不等看完全文便拿起硃砂筆批上六個大字「不敢久留仙駕」一個紅頂子便這樣輕輕送掉。這笑話，在描笑「文抄公」的愚昧，是最淋漓盡緻的。</p>
<p>然而，高爾基那段話的所謂「東抄西襲」，並不指的這樣淺薄的抄襲，而是進一步的說法。</p>
<p>高爾基的意思，是以爲要把科學的眞理，寫成兒童的讀物，東抄西襲，把些科學上的術語或原理活生生地搬出來是不成功的，應該使那科學的語言，溶化在自已的筆尖下，成爲藝術的語言。於是便非有素養的科學家與高超的作家底合作不可了。在這裏，所謂抄襲·不僅是瞭解問題，還有溶化問題，不僅篇幅剪裁的問題，還有文字使用的問題。這正是針對着通俗文化運動而發的。</p>
<p>引用高爾基的話來解釋徐君所提出的第二個疑問，我們可以這樣說：</p>
<p>把世界名著改編成通俗本，不僅要文字通俗化，而且要使内容通俗化，編者旣不能對於原作的見解有所歪曲，但亦不能只在原作的圈套内兜圈子。比如：編一本文學名著通俗本你决不能從原作中一段段節錄起來就算完事，必須寫成你自已的最通俗的文字，使人來看完全一個面目，否則雖云通俗而並不通俗，只能算是「抄襲」了。改編科學名著，更是應該這樣。所以，改編並不是「抄襲」，一個改編者，對於原作未能溶化，僅是活生地吐出來，而沒有達到通俗化的目的，乃是「抄襲」。</p>
<p>我們希望凡是通俗文化運動者，應該注意高爾基的那段話。</p>

<p>神户之一般敎育、已於上節粗枝大葉略述矣、今常濡筆記錄參觀該市各校之所得、卽以各該校之特長、擬撰標題而奉告國人、</p>
<p>吾人屢曰、第一次參觀之學校爲神户市北野尋常小學、時在四月四日上午八時、於陰雲密布、斜風細雨中由早稻田大學同學師雲風及神阪中華公學校長董公勗二君作嚮導、比至、但見校門主　中日兩旗、　風招展、全體敎職員站立門旁俯首示敬、肅客入禮堂、欵以豐富之茶點、女敎員爲吾人煮香茗送糕餅等、戰戰兢惟恐失禮、據稱日本小學校役鮮少、一切雜務、悉由敎職員分任、飲茶取乎巾、均躬自爲之、該校校長田淵岩男、年已四十三、而爲神户年齒最輕之校長、市民往往以是作談話資料、是日因赴東京出席「全國小學敎員作興會」、尙未返枃、所謂小學敎員作興會者、卽小學敎員之振興會、爲年來日本敎育界最大之集會、用意在紀念皇太子之誔生而喚醒三十萬小學敎員、從事兒童靑年思想之善導、是會四月一日在東京舉行、昭行皇帝視蒞訓話、並賜勅語曰、</p>
<p>「振作國民道德而致國運隆昌者、其淵源實基於小學敎育、當局者其夙夜奮勵努力之」是種勅語、卽若吾國昔日之聖旨、亦卽日本敎育之新宗旨、而恢復其　時之作育土風」、「陶冶品性之敎育宗旨、此蓋吾儒敎之主張、新生活活動之要點、故不憚煩厭而伸述之、</p>
<p>代現校爲該中校訓導脇谷淸一、其歡迎辭、事先石印及時分贈我人、寒喧畢、吾人參觀該校六年生體操、男女生由男女敎員於同時同塲分别敎學、各生肌肉發達、姿勢優美、精神飽滿、觀者昨舌、天氣雖寒、上身僅穿一衛生衣、下身短褲一條、赤腿赤足、居然操練末及片刻、個個汗流如珠、敎師口令、宏亮非凡其勇猛進取之狀况、如臨大敵、先練凖備操、個别柔軟操、侶濱肋膜操、木馬操、終習腰腹運動、倒立運動、呼吸運動、此間爲吾人所注意者、（一）每個兒童具有運動機會、（二）每個兒童之成績、均在水平線以上、（三）每個兒童均能發揮固有天性、（四）各種運動男生側重硬性的鍜鍊、女生偏於柔性的優美、（五）體育敎員卽級任敎員、嘗聞日本代表在世界衛生敎育會議上報告、後邦之體育敎育着重於身體的精神的二方面、前者在乎體格之發達、後者在乎性情之陶冶、一九二一年始敎育部設體育課、專事視導校内外體育訓練、卽窮鄕僻壤、亦有專家之指導體育研究會、體育聯盟會胥於十年前成立、從事活動、體育出版物多恒河沙數、日本之國家名之曰體育國家、亦無不可、惟其體育鍜鍊之對象、爲體育而體育歟、抑别有所作用歟、頗費吾人　躇、</p>
<p>神户體育名著日本、北野體育又斐聲神户、代現校長脇谷爲日本小學體育聞人、曾留學瑞士數年、專習瑞士體操、著作豐富、歸國仍服務於小學、爲人懇摰、夜間每來舍館談話、並惠贈記者健康敎育書籍多種、記者詢其各校體育敎材、彼稱神户小學體育敎材、全市統一、每校早會時、全體師生均出席操練身體、每日各開運動會、日日舉行大會操、體操外復有劍道·柔道·拳術等武功、彼邦民族體格之健全、非無因也、</p>
<p>夫體育之於國家、實精髓之於人體、曠觀中外、未有無精髓而健康之人、尤未有無禮育而强盛之國體育、體育殆爲療吾民族萎靡之良藥歟、上海有不少日本小學、凡吾小學敎員、至少校長及體育敎員、應前往參觀其體育敎育而思所以痛改、風雨如晦、鷄嗚不已、執干戈以衛社稷之思想普遍、方待於體育之昂揚記者願掬熱忱、希冀國人之重視體育、</p>
<p>體操課完畢、吾人相率觀察各科凖備室、所謂凖備室者、卽供給敎學上一切之材料房屋、例如地理凖備室、則所有地圖·模型·物產·儀器·等彚集於室内、敎師應用之、學生實習之、各平皆如是、吾人至裁縫室、見各生忙於裁剪·縫紉·女生五年起卽有此項選課、開始學習縫紉機器者、先以紙踏同及垂　起直綫、然後用熨斗燙平、縫紉機約十餘架、年幼者可用手搖機、</p>
<p>觀察告竣、該校學生表演各種童謠舞如望月之夜毬及諸候、軍隊遊戲·騎士·空中艦隊·横街·皇子·其内容皆尙武化、無非反映大和民族之武士魂、</p>
<p>該校校舍佔地一五七九平方米、空地三八三三平方米、建築費共八五三九四金、建築樣式爲近世式鋼骨水泥三層、在彼猶悻悻然嫌校舍之簡陋、蓋彼邦小學之建築費達二百萬金以上者、司空見慣矣、</p>

<p>可是前面的人便累得够了，他是不准倒退着走的；必須像後面人一樣地臉望着前面，然後再把手臂屈向背後去拉住着盤的邊條，慢慢的走。讀者試想：每三襲龍衣盛一個盤，每一個盤用兩個太監抬着，這樣算起來，每當太后要查看伊的衣飾的時候，這行列該有多少長？</p>
<p>太后旣擁有如許鉅額的衣服，當然是可以隨時更換的了。但是因爲它們的數量已多得過了分的緣故，無論伊每天換兩次，三次，却仍有許多衣服是永遠穿不到的；雖然它們的質料是同樣的優美繡工是同樣的精細，無奈太后一時想不起來，便祇得生生地貶入冷宮中去了！其中還有一部份是富於情感的紀念的，那便是數十年前當伊初進宮時充一個貴妃的時候所穿過的衣服。因爲有這種紀念的關係，伊雖是從不再穿，却時常要敎那些太監去取來把玩的，似乎很有味地把玩着。在這當兒，我往往可以從伊的面部表情上，推想到伊内心上的感覺。伊是竭力的在追念伊自已往日的綺年玉貌，和許多過去的美景良辰，伊還想從幻覺上取到一些少年人的快樂。所以伊每次總是想得很出神的，甚至會想上好幾十分鐘；當伊在想得出神的時候，誰也不准向伊說話，以免打斷伊的思索。就是我有什麽事情要禀告伊，丨如今想來，那時候我胆子很大，往往不管伊想得息樣的出神，我還是照舊的說話。丨伊也决不理踩的。</p>

<p>一提到蘇杭，大家要懹著艷羨的心情似的，以爲居住在那裏的人們，必定有安居天堂般舒適，而吃著可以不愁的。不錯，蘇杭兩處，有馬路，有銀行，有大的旅館，有炫耀的霓虹，還有肉的誘惑，酒的香氣等等：所以吃也好，住也好，穿也好。總之，如果一處地方沒有這些，便不配稱爲「天堂」的話，那末，天堂之稱，蘇杭的確當之可以無愧，而住在那裏的人們，也値得驕傲了。</p>
<p>蘇州的情狀怎樣，我不得而知；現在就把杭州來談談罷。</p>
<p>一位朋友告訴我，他從某處歸來，距家門不數步，爲一黃包車夫所阻。他哀哀地說：「先生，請你坐了車兒去罷。從早晨八時，至此刻將近正午，我還沒找得一主顧呢！」說罷，那黃包車夫已淚如雨下了。</p>
<p>猪肉賤極，一塊大洋可買六斤！（市秤）大家都詫　著，那末落得便宜，似乎都可一快朶頣了。然而每當下午走過肉店門前、常見一大塊一大塊的弔在鐵鈞上，外遮以白布，店裏的人們時時用了箒兒蘸了水，向那肉塊灑著。</p>
<p>從羊壩頭到保佑坊，目之所見，有「不顧血本」，「加一放五」，「關店大拍賣」，「特别大犧牲」，「本店向抱薄利主義」等等的字句；耳之所聞，軍樂和十番鑼鼓在狂奏著哀曲，大有如泣如訴之致。過街的彩牌樓，雖還壁挺的站著，向人苦笑，然而有誰去眯它們呢！</p>
<p>如果天堂裏也有這種情景，那末杭州誠足令人艷羨了，但不知蘇州如何。</p>

<p>三十年前，一年掙一百塊錢的，已是頂兒尖兒的大先生了，莫說論起婚來、紅庚帖，要多少，便多少。便在大街上踱閒步，鄕前輩們，也得對之恭而敬之，掇臀捧屁的了，其實，那時候，一塊錢，不過兌到八百個康熙大白錢。一年一百塊，兌來也不過八萬個大錢而已。</p>
<p>這年頭兒，是不對了，每月掙一百塊錢的，雖然一塊錢可換三百三十枚銅子，在實際上，一百塊錢，可値三十三萬孔主兄，但在一般人目中，雖然不說是免討飯，但怕也不見得吃香到怎麽程度了。</p>
<p>前後還不過三十年之差而已、生活程度之差，却已無可諱言的起了絶大的變化。瞧吧，從前的一個康熙大白錢，比了這年頭兒的一個銅子，正不知要値錢到多少倍呢。</p>
<p>現在的洋價，老是在三千以外了。我有一個不知所云的幻想，假使現在的一個銅子，眞有三十年前十個康熙大白錢的那麽値錢的話，那不用說，這個世界上，是决不會再有盜匪，乞丐的踪跡的了。</p>
<p>但是，在目前，一個銅子兒的價値，究竟還値到一個銅了兒，我恐三十年後，一個雙毫銀幣，怕還値不到今日一個銅子兒的價値呢。到那時候，莫說每月掙一百塊錢的活不下，就是每天掙一百的，怕也有些兒難了。</p>

<p>目送哀鴻埋頭守國土　　彈穿勁臂灑血染孤城</p>
<p>信封找不着，在文書盒子裏翻了許久，找出了一張表格紙，折疊着成了一個信封的式樣，將信包着，寫好了收信人姓名住赴，這就悄悄的走了出來，找了一個相識的百姓握住了他的手低聲道：老鄕，我有一件事，要拜託你一下。說着，在身上掏了一塊現洋，塞到他手上。那老百姓接了這塊錢，睜着眼睛望了倒不知如何對答是好，自强再將那封信塞到他手上，苦笑着道：這是我一封家信，勞你的駕，給我帶到一個市鎭上，買幾分郵票，給我寄了去。老百姓道：老總，我給你帶去就是了，買幾分郵票，也要不了許多錢。自强道：我們在這裏要關起門來打仗了，有錢也沒用。你是個逃難的人，身上揣着一塊錢，就有一塊錢的好處，你帶着罷。只要你肯和我遲早帶到，我就感謝不盡了。老百姓道：老總，誰沒有求人的時候，我一定送到，你放心得了。自强抱着拳頭，向他連連拱了兩下，就轉身而去。這樣一來，他似得着極大的安慰，好像胸中塞住了一方胚塊，這時已經掏了出來。凡是當兵的人，他們在想家的時候，沒有别的法子可以解此苦悶，只有兩個法子，來求着安慰。其一是得着家裏的信，又其一却是寫信給家裏去。但是得着家裏信，這不是容易的事，幾乎一年碰不到如此一個機會。所以自强在信上寫着字，就是和家裏人說了話，信寄出去，就算家裏人聽着了。在最後交通保存着的一日，還得和家裏通上這封信，心裏非常的痛快。再也沒有什麽顧慮了，按照着營長的命令，工作起來。（　○七）</p>

<p>拍拉圖說：「女性的一身，無不爲愛情所籠罩。」這話未免說得過分偏重於女性的一面，其實，不論男性或女性，在靑春火焰燒得最熾的時候，它是需要着愛情底慰藉的。</p>
<p>說到愛情，有些人把它看得太神秘了，甚至拿它當作一種至上的東西，像一尊偶像在痴愚的崇拜着，瘋狂般模樣作踐於其自已，把它們的幸福和一生都殉葬在這痴情的泥土中，它那一片眞摰，熱烈的愛念，不用說是會換取到一般人們的同情與憐憫。</p>
<p>但是，另外有種性格相反的人，態度是浮滑而不忠實的。其於愛情的虔心也未能持久而且專一，往往利用愛情來作一種欺騙的手段，愚弄對方，糟塌對方。像這些人，都是那愛神座前待審的罪囚。</p>
<p>據說，在明星最近作品「女性的仇敵」影片裏，就是緊抓着這一點綴成的故事，表現出社會上兩個男性的典型，一個是痴情的，一個是欺騙者，同時把戀愛的眞諦與動態的轉變都竭力地發揮出來而加以沈痛的針砭。願談情說愛的朋友們，在它畫面的織成上，去看盡那姿態暴露的醜惡與美研吧！</p>

<h3 id="c227">夏季四大害敵的防除 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>蠅時交夏令，氣候漸熱，各種害人的病虫，今後逐日的繁殖了。我們在這時期，應當留心預防，免得受傳染病的害。害人的病虫中最危險的，要算蒼蠅，據衛生家調查所得，一個蒼蠅中　菌的數目，祇少有五百五十個，多至六百六十萬個，其　菌的大部分，是人畜的糞便中的大腸菌，這菌就是爲虎剌拉，痢疾·腸窒扶斯等病源菌，蒼蠅見到這菌，很喜歡吃的，常常吃得滿腹，或從口中吐出，或從肛門排出，所以夏季室内的墻壁上，桌上，衣服上，器具上，被蒼蠅停過脚後，留下來的糞點，用顯微鏡照起來，有一千以上一萬以下的　菌，加上蒼蠅脚上帶來的，起碼有在一萬五千以上，假使我們直接的（在瓜果菓餚上吃進）或間接的（在器具上用手帶進）吃進肚子，就要發生疾病了。蠅的成長很快，由卵成虫，在半個月以上，蠅所愛的顏色，爲薔薇色，最惡的爲綠色紫色紅色，倘在窗上裝以紅紫綠色等玻璃，那蠅就不能耐居室内了。滅蠅的藥，有煤油乳劑，朋靑，四鹽化炭素，克羅魯方「（Ｃｈｌｏｒｏｆｏｒｍ）無色透明强揮發性有臭氣善殺菌」（Ｅｆｔｈｅｒ）汽油，克羅魯比克林（Ｃｈｌｏｒｏｙｃｌｉｎ）等。但是蠅的蛹比蛆，其殺蟲劑的抵抗力更强，所以使用克雷梭爾肥皂液（Ｋｒｅｓｏｌ）十％溶液，能在五分間，完全絶滅，如用十倍到二十倍的稀薄煤油乳劑，亦能滅其八九分的。</p>
<p>蚊</p>
<p>蚊子亦爲傳染病媒介物之一，蚊的種類，有二百數丨種，一次所生的卵，少則七八十個，多則三四百個，驅除蚊的根本要件，（一）淸除陰溝汚水的流通，（二）刈除池沼河川旁邊的雜草，（三）整理潮濕地方的淸潔，（四）用煤油澆在水面，可以免蚊在水中發生，（五）如在室中，要防其夜間擾亂，可用樟腦除蟲菊浮萍三者混和，在室内焚燒，那蚊必紛紛　地的。</p>
<p>蚤</p>
<p>有人蚤，犬蚤，貓蚤，鼠蚤的分别，預防蚤的發生，第一要把室内掃除淸潔，第二常撒以臭藥水，犬貓的蚤，可用樟腦，除虫菊，那夫太林消毒藥（Ｎａｐｈｔｈａｌｅｎｅ）混和，抺在犬貓的皮毛中，或敷在寢褥上面，决可驅滅的。</p>
<p>臭蟲</p>
<p>臭蟲到了黃梅天，爲其產卵期，在產卵以前，應當特别留心驅除，我們在板壁隙縫，床的棚架的乾燥黒暗地方，在這時期内，最好用蒸氣消毒法，與煤油撒布法，但這種害蟲，以貧窮的家庭爲最多，蒸氣消毒究竟辦不到的，而煤油撒布，要防火患。照余的經騐，最好用開水冲洗，或用蟹殻辣茄子木爪混在木屑中，緊閉門窗不可洩氣，在室内焚燒。那能够絶滅無遺，不過焚燒時，這烟氣很厲害，我們觸到這烟氣，便要頭暈。所以焚燒後要先留心開啓門窗，切不可多觸這烟氣，假使我們在旅途中，要安靜一夜，可用雄黃加于食鹽水中，向床的棚架上一噴，就可以了。</p>

<p>— 非心</p>
<p>凡人總要由小　大的，最可有爲的是老年，最重要的是靑年。凡老年人看不算事的問題，在靑年却是大問題，因之靑年問題，有時卽算可憐可笑吧，是大問題。凡大智者，明白人，有經騐有思想的人們，應該加以指導。</p>
<p>正如果實的目的，是爛掉，重新長出更佳的果實來。在生之旅途中，大家皆是過客：如遊玩山水者，當將山水之佳勝處指示給後來的人，有危險處當然也指點出來，或者將其平掉以便來者。</p>
<p>所以有許多人說：經騐卽學問，是不錯的。離開人生之外，有什麽爲學問的學問呢？沒有的。讀書的多，如於已於人皆無關係，不算是學問的。</p>
<p>但徒然傳授經騐，有利也有弊了。動機固然可嘉，而擇術不可不愼。阮籍的兒子請飲酒，阮籍不許，「吾家已有阿咸在」，正是哲人的行徑，那是并不以自已爲中心，敎世間皆學自已。</p>
<p>但看舊家庭有時敎育子弟，敎牌賭則欲其不輸，敎武藝則企其不敗，敎逛游則欲其不荒，最普通是敎應酬而冀其順世，雖屬仁者之用心，然距敎育之道又頗遠了。</p>
<p>那錯誤，也還是以自已爲中心的緣故。如果以靑年爲靑年，自有其發展和前途，有許多時勢和環境已經改變，舊道法用不着了，這種錯誤是可免的。</p>
<p>自得之自失之無憾，可憾者波連；邁往而傾覆者不足悲，可悲者蹈覆轍。丨丨我們看現代許多靑年的苦痛，于家庭有衝突，與異性有紛爭，其實各方皆是好意，而得不好的結果，而得不好的結果，動機誰看見呢？那癥結就在這裏。</p>

<h3 id="c229">讀「皇明百家小說」雜記 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>無人不知在近代小說中有「老殘遊記」，讀「老殘遊記」者又無人不知濟南有大明湖，更無人不知大明湖上有鐵鉉祠，以及鐵鉉的悲壯的死。惟鐵鉉死後的家庭慘狀則無人能說，廣博如有「考據癖與歷史癖」的胡適之，在他的考證裏也似乎沒有提到。</p>
<p>近讀王鏊「震澤紀聞」，其間有一則涉及此事，謂鐵鉉旣被殺，「其家屬發敎坊爲娼。鉉有二女，皆誓不受辱，仁朝卽位，赦出之，皆嫁朝士。二女爲詩自述、長女詩曰：</p>
<p>敎坊脂粉洗鉛華，</p>
<p>一片閒心對落花。</p>
<p>舊曲聽來猶有恨，</p>
<p>故園歸去已無家。</p>
<p>雲　半綰臨妝鏡，</p>
<p>雨淚空流濕綘紗。</p>
<p>今日相逢白司馬，</p>
<p>樽前重與訴琵琶。</p>
<p>其妹詩云：</p>
<p>骨肉傷殘舊業荒，</p>
<p>此身何忍去歸娼？</p>
<p>涕垂玉筋辭官舍，</p>
<p>步蹴金蓮入敎坊。</p>
<p>攬鏡自憐傾城貌，</p>
<p>向人羞學倚門妝。</p>
<p>春來雨露寛如海，</p>
<p>嫁得陶郎勝阮郎。</p>
<p>兩詩自以前者爲佳，蓋其抒寫悲懐，對官家的不屈不感，較其妹的終不免　「春來雨露」，在人格上優勝得多，不僅就詩的技術上亦彼勝於此也。特錄之以告讀「老殘游記」者。</p>
<p>（二）明自袁氏弟兄主張抒寫性靈，閘明辭達眞義而後，一時議論紛紜，有同情公安而反李王者，有擁護李王而反公安者，有不置一辭者，亦有對二者均示不同意者。若陳于陛使屬於最後的一派。其言曰：</p>
<p>「作文不必論奇古，須自成一家意見。讀之首尾成章，不逗漏，便是好文，且可觀其人之行事功業受用。今人但務新奇剽竊，全無由衷眞的之見。余譬之如常人衣布袍，猶是好衣。若以綾羅等割裁補綴，其値雖貴，終非完衣。如貧家食菽粟，尙是好食，若乞兒從墦間乞得酒肉雖多，終賤鄙可恥也。」此則見於于陛所作「意見」一書，對兩方均示不滿而成其爲第三派。不過比較的說，對於公安的同情是勝於對于鱗元美的。當時文壇形勢，於此可見一斑。</p>
<p>（三）唐李白，人第知其爲詩人，不知其所作散文，風韻亦如其詩。顧元慶「　曝偶談」，曾由胡文穆書，託轉錄其三帖。</p>
<p>其一云：「乘　踏月，西人酒家，不覺人物兩忘，身在世外。」</p>
<p>其二云：「夜來月下臥醒，花影零辭，滿人襟懐，疑如濯魄於冰壼也」</p>
<p>其三云：「樓虚月白，秋宇物化，於斯憑欄，身世飛動，把洒自忘，此輿何極？」元慶說此帖「非太白不能道一，可謂誠然。</p>
<p>（四）田汝成委巷　談一，戲有關於水滸傳傳說一則，殊奇。其言曰，「錢塘羅貫中本者，南宋時人，編撰小說數十種，而水滸傳序宋江等事姦盜脫　，機巧甚詳，然變詐百端，壞人心術，其子孫三代皆啞，天道好還之報如此。一此種傳說，不知何所根據。似不可靠也。</p>
<p>（五）明人學蘇東坡生活形式者甚多，當時頗有人詆之謂爲「今世之人，無往不蘇，」余前曾記之。近讀張鳳翼譚輅，亦見有一則，說「近來士大夫謝病，多挈一僧出遊，以表見其高，人見了便謂是蘇長公佛印作用。」當時文壇風習，於此可見。若今日班禪之能以在杭州開金剛法會，自上而下，到處歡迎，固亦有蘇味在，然其作用，是有更甚於自嗚其高者。</p>
<p>（六）傳奇曲本，於元明爲盛。洪文科於「語窺今古」中記其事說，「往昔英雄豪俠，秘計奇謀，可喜可驚，眞足照耀千古，太史公記之詳矣。然天下豈皆操觚染翰之士，按籍而覩者寗幾何人？匹夫匹婦茫乎未知也。</p>
<p>我朝騷人墨客，作浣紗紅拂竊符投筆等記，其間慷慨悲歌，風流　邁，樹蓋世洪勳之奇男子，具超塵偉識之俠婦人，編之詞曲，演之壇塲，俾當年行事，歷歷在目前。凡有血氣者咸知奮發，誠感激人心之一助，可謂盛矣。如觀此而徒以聲音衣服與傀儡同類而共笑之，眞所謂木石人也。」以載道之眼光，論元明的曲本，固不完全對，然元明曲本所以發達，完全是由於大衆化的原因，容易懂的原因，卽在此則中亦可見到。</p>
<p>（七）關於不抵抗主義的往事，我已經記得不少。然此種材料，仍是隨手可拾，不抵抗主義的淵源，在中國眞令人有深遠之想。王錡「寓圃雜記」記其事之一云：「揚先生翥爲修撰，居京師，隣家有失雞者，指其姓而駡。家人以告，先生曰，坊市中不獨我一家姓楊，又一隣居甚隘，雨至必從先生家出水，甚受其汚濕之患，家人復告，先生解之曰，晴乾日多，雨落日少。其德量類如此」。據此，在歷史上，不抵抗主義者又添二人矣。</p>
<p>（八）在前人隨筆中，往往有極富情趣之小文，信手寫來，寥寥數語，曲盡佳妙，予極喜擇錄。王世懋「　酉委譚」中，亦不乏此等文字，如云：</p>
<p>「五月十二日，歸自郡城，夜臥憊甚。惡聞蚊聲，不寢久之。街鼓欲動，始得帖寢。忽窗外淙淙，於雨望雨，不啻調饑。竹床布衾，半醒半臥。呼侍兒搥，皆聽之，覺倦熊盡蘇。檢點胸中，略無一事，唯課兒作文題已先一夕出矣，爲復展轉間，聞老妻喚聲，蓋督課僮婢受黃梅水，採茉莉花耳。又作此不急之務，一笑。披衣而起，　櫛焚誦畢，出坐心遠堂中，命筆伸紙作數行記之」</p>
<h3 id="c230">談鬼 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>每天看報都是只是隨意翻翻，大事弄不淸楚，小事更管不了那許多，但旣然在看報，總是要被人認爲「秀才不出門能知天下事」的，今天送飯的廚司，又問起我閘北之鬼報上是怎樣登着了。他預備下午不遠十里去看，因此要求向我搜集一點參攷資料。看他那樣的熱心，自已反深深抽了一口冷氣。</p>
<p>張玖琯，科學靈乩圖，還沒有使一般人覺得鬼已太多，於是更時時在創製新的靈蹟。知堂老人的「街頭終日聽談鬼」，雖然早已挨了大駡，然證之以上海的新聞，倒不敢十分肯定說那不是事實。在北平人眼中，上海久已是天堂，上海也不免於見鬼，北平之早被鬼話濔漫，實可想見。</p>
<p>在這樣的不景氣情形下，免不了有的是租不出的空　，看慣了寸地皆金的上海人，尙未慣於怎麽房屋會沒有人租的思索，自然轉到吉屋招租的吉字上去做文章。從前呢，大飯店内自殺者血漬未乾的房間，馬上會有人搬進，現在說不定會空上幾月。</p>
<p>除了得頭彩，現在人很難希望有意内的佳運。無論從事什麽事業的，談起來是搖頭，幹起來是失敗，不吉兩個字，横在每個人的心中，這一次閘北之鬼無論怎樣證實其爲虚空，仍不免在每個不吉之家裏，添上一個暗鬼。</p>
<p>儘管是不相信鬼的人，也老會被從一不幸的屋子内搬出，甚至有一星期從這裏到那裏搬上幾次的。種種的暗影太多了，能歸之於鬼，倒未嘗不是蠢福。</p>
<h3 id="c231">蛇與神話 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 曙山</p>
<p>明明的今年是狗年，而蛇偏要大出其風頭。</p>
<p>我們只看最近的，京，滬各報上，不斷揭載關於蛇的那些離奇古怪的新聞，就可知道蛇確乎在蠢然思動了。</p>
<p>舉例來說：首如鎭江南郊的要道上，突現大蛇，長約丈許，縛一農人，傷重身死，這固然是不失蛇爲毒蟲的本性（見六月七日「中央日報」）。又如上海維也納舞塲，正當紙醉金迷之際，忽然發現怪蛇九條，直嚇得男女舞客，全塲大譁，這又是人的惡作劇了。</p>
<p>最奇怪的，要算是常州的圍護女孩的一蛇，和浦東的攢新娘轎的一蛇。前者是：「常州有船主施德文，妻施氏，生男女各一。最近又由北鄕抱回生甫三月之女孩，擬養大爲兒媳。詎該女孩以缺乏乳料，體弱多病，旋卽奄奄一息，施氏狠心，竟於夜間用蒲包包女送至山墓間。翌日有過路人，聞墓間有小孩啼哭，卽隨聲往觀，祇見一長有丈餘之蛇，正捲伏小孩側，作保護之狀，旁立數野犬，欲攫孩而不敢，大奇，乃報官。事白，施氏被捕，女孩送交城内救濟院扶養。」（見「小說月刋，六月號）這條蛇，眞可以說是仁義的蛇，殆與春秋時乳楚令尹子文的那隻虎，堪爲伯仲吧。</p>
<p>後者見六月七日上海各報，大意是：「浦東曹蔭山之子曹全林，幼聘農民黃泉麟之女妹妹爲室，未婚先奸。愛情結晶，今已五月，乃提早迎娶。届時舖張揚厲，執事全班，乃新娘轎於中途張江棚西首觀音堂地方，突迎面來靑黃色巨蛇一條，長有丈餘，直往轎中攢進，新娘驚駭而號。迨嗚　以驅，蛇竟翹半身仰首作鞠躬搖頭之狀，並嘘嘘如傷感之態。蛇旣驅下，迎娶人等遂急令抬轎飛奔，乃行一里之後，該蛇又呈於眼簾，復驅之，始迎歸成婚。」這條蛇，却不知是何道理。難道牠對這種「先行交易，擇吉開張」的新式婚姻，也有什麽意見麽？</p>
<p>這兩則新聞，眞好像將神話時代的故事在重演着。不錯，蛇從來在人的心目中，就不曾脫過神怪性，姑不問牠的自身究竟是蟲抑是神怪。</p>
<p>據「史記」所載，太古之人，如伏羲，女媧，都是蛇身人首的怪人。至禹鏧龍門，見一蛇神，並敎禹以平定水土之法，這據「拾遺記」說，卽羲皇。又「左傳」說鄭的南門有内外蛇相鬥，則稱爲妖異。其次有「搜神記」内的載「蛇珠」的傳說。蛇的神話，眞是不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>在外國，古代神話的傳說中，說及蛇的故事的，也實在很多。「舊約全書」内的「創世記」，記着，人類的始祖夏娃和亞當，被蛇誘惑偷吃樹果的情形，那是最有力的一種。</p>
<p>總之，蛇這東西也太挑皮了，愈因人旣被牠誘惑至於墮落後，從而憎牠，怕牠，但又要敬牠，則牠的花樣也　得愈多而愈臻巧妙。</p>
<p>最近的中國人，是被牠這巧妙的花樣所惑迷，而將時代倒流着了。</p>
<h3 id="c232">火災（八） <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>一看，火燄在左邊第二三間的店上燒。已經開始接着羣　號了。火勢是大得利害，直向上冒，差不多有二三丈高，把天上照個通紅。类燄彌漫在天空裏。空氣裏是嗅到東西燒焦的臭味，並且聽到一些東西爆裂的聲音。火燄一呑一吐，風趕着它，把它從一邊趕到另一邊。有。時看見像煤油箱般的東西，在一個爆炸聲之後，被抛向高高的天空，然後又跌下來。風聲，火聲，東西爆裂聲，以及一切人們和狗們的哭喊，一同混和在這黑夜的大氣裏。</p>
<p>在當前，許多苦力們和許多土人在做着搬貨和救火的工作，紛亂地，忽忙地來往。在河邊，運到了寳貴的退潮的淺水；在前面，水被灌向炎裏。水一傾，火勢一沈，然後又在旺盛地更燒起來了。勇敢的救火員在拆卸右邊第三間的屋子；但是，火是更快地隨着風趕着追過去了。這，使救火員沒有法子辦，尤其是在這個市政不完備的村鎭上。</p>
<p>看看人力是沒有法子了，於是大家的臉上塗上了土色。婦妇們的哭聲震天，男人們倒啞了。看看這個好幾十年甚至成百年立着的根基在這一刹那破滅了：看看這個成千人的飯碗寄託的所在是毁敗了，誰不爲自已的歷史和生活計哭呀！</p>
<p>在這裏，我又尋到我的朋友張文生。我看見他赤着脚，疲勞而且懊喪，面上塗了一層泥土的灰黯，躺在一小堆殘貨堆上像生了大病般，奄奄地倒着了。</p>
<p>我想到下午的預言竟在這一天，不，這幾點鐘内應騐；想到我怎樣奇怪地從國内跑了幾萬里路亦參加這個悲劇。在這裏，看着我十年前的小友困頓在人生的災禍裏，履行着他心裏所日夜惶恐着的事態裏面，我將用什麽話向他安慰呢？</p>
<p>「朋友，平安吧！别的不相干了，你聽着天的指示吧！」我呑着這幾個不中用的字眼。</p>
<p>『是的，便是相干，要怎麽樣？』接着，他嘘着氣。我看見他的怒氣像火一般旺盛。</p>
<p>我們是沈默着。在這個災禍之下，除了縅默是唯一可能消遺這個難過的時間以外，别的是沒有法子了。</p>
<p>風仍舊趕着火跑，受着在被火燒着的店裏的猛烈的燃媒的帮助，火勢是更加熱鬧，和更加暴烈了。這時，在這深夜的冷風裏，在我的心間，却寂寞和空虚得可怕！我的身體不住地抖着；在這個赤熱之國，我從來不曾感到會有這般的寒冷。</p>
<p>天漸漸在光了，晨　漸漸地從東方爬得來。一等到東方的紅霞一和火燄相襯，火却漸漸地减退牠的强烈的色彩。</p>
<p>太陽慢慢地從地下爬起來，牠的光輝一出現，火勢却漸漸低下去了。風，顯着低抑的樣子，吹了一整夜，現在漸漸有停　的趨勢。人們悲喪的心是表現在臉上，這悲慘的表情又給明顯地暴露在這光明了的早晨。看看左邊的店址已成火燼，而在右邊，火漸漸在消退了，是將熄滅了罷？</p>
<p>這塲大火一直延燒到早上九點鐘左右才完全熄滅。天一亮，荷蘭政府的縣長已從四十哩外的縣衙門那邊乘了小汽船趕來，立刻恊同當地的酋長（十三）分派警察和兵士撲滅漸歸熄滅的餘火。並且派了許多土人在廣塲上搭起了簡單的「阿答厝」，收容這些受着火災的難民。早上，還從酋長的王府裏煮來了許多鍋熱粥，慰　這些被難者。在這離　國萬里的地方我享受了一碗荷政府施與的粥，這件事是一生都不會忘記的。</p>
<p>（註十三）南來羣島在未被歐人管理以前，本來是不統一的。他們還屬部落時代，一個小地方有一個酋長治理着。這些地方由歐人管理之後，酋長制度還保存着，殖民地政府賦給他們一點微小的權利，倒樂得用以帮助治理土人哩。</p>

<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>丨從華安坊鬧鬼想到的問題丨</p>
<p>這幾天，一陣「法會」和「科學靈乩」郲雜着的熱風剛吹了過去，本埠的市上却又有一椿「奇事」「盛大」地「宣揚」起來。據說閘北華安坊的空屋裏鬧着什麽鬼了。據說：「夜裏有許多人在那空屋中聚賭，並且還有無綫電聲，談笑聲，和牌聲混雜着，等到叩門闖入，則丙中　無一人。」於是某甲說得眉飛色舞，某乙聽得目瞪口呆；某乙又曲意渲染得活龍活現，某丙更聽得毛骨悚然，······這樣一傳二，二傳三，地傳遍了大街，傳遍了店舖，傳入了「公館」，傳入了「寫字間。」於是坐在茶坊裏的人們架起腿談着，洋布店的夥計伏在櫃子談着，電車裏的乘客。望着報紙上的紅字談着，談着談着，都談得口起白沫，津津乎其有味。最後他們下個結論是：「眞奇怪！「好奇怪！」於是他們結伴到華安坊看去，於是華安坊所在的馬路上，頓是「車如流水馬如龍」了。</p>
<p>啊猗歟盛哉！世界上「好奇」的人恐沒有再像我們國人這樣熱烈的了！不，世界上好奇的人，恐沒有再像我們國人這樣「純粹」的了。因爲别人家的好奇心，往往能成「研究」「探討」的發動機，而我們國人的「好奇心」，則純粹是好「奇」，而止是沒有下文的。若因好奇而引起種種的麻煩，我們國人是决計弄不來的。譬如說華安坊鬧了鬼，無疑的會引起我們國人濃厚的「好奇心」，他們會不惜時間去東西宣傳，會不管路途的遠近到那面去看，就卽使毫無所得，他們也滿不在乎地始終覺得這是「奇」事，但他們永不會檢探可「奇」的原由的。如果有人一提出「何以有鬼怪？」以及「鬼怪是什麽？」等的問題，他們的「好奇」興趣便立刻减低下去；如果再有人根據甚麽科學的解釋來闢斥這「奇聞」，那他們簡直會掉頭而去，因爲這未免太「掃興」了啊。</p>
<p>卽就那所謂「科學靈乩」說吧，前幾天，簡直鬧得「滿城風雨」，這在二十年前已經有人根據科學說明了的東西，（陳大齊著迷信與心理）却不道復見怪於今日，這就足以證明中國人之「好奇心」是如何的濃厚，他們不願「眞理」來拆穿他們所「好」的「奇事」，却寗願「奇事」來抹煞一切眞理的，什麽科學解釋，什麽心理研究，這在好「奇」的我們國人心中簡直是「煞風景」的「勞什子！」</p>
<p>「好奇心」，在中國似乎别有一種意義。别人家的「好奇心」是能長時間維持着的，而中國人則只憑一時的衝動，「好奇心」在别人常能引起注意的研究，而在中國則只是出於隨便的消遣，我且舉二個例吧：</p>
<p>英國某貴族家的女傭，一天晚上生病了，病中忽然講起希膍話來，大家都說着了魔，因爲這女傭是根本沒有學過希臘話的，這消息傳了開去，便有許多好奇的人來探視，這樣就引起了心理學家，醫生，偵探······的甚熱烈的研究，過了五六年，終于探得這女子曾在一語言博士家帮傭過，而語言博士每天晚上要讀希臘，這纔證明女傭雖不曾學習希文，她的下意識却把希臘文學會了，而在意識模糊下意識抬頭的時候表現了出來。</p>
<p>若中國遇到這樣的問題，我想將一定成爲千古不滅的「奇事」，而永遠得不到這樣合理的解釋。</p>
<p>中國人的「好奇心」是怎樣的呢？下面一個笑話最形容得好：</p>
<p>有個人在街上散步，忽然想起了心事，便倚在路旁的樹裏仰首沉思，過了</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>一會，他忽然發現身旁圍滿了一大圈的人，都在仰首張望，他大喫一驚，溜出重圍，等走遠了才回頭看去，只見那邊人已愈聚愈多，都抬着頭向着他先前所仰向的天空望着，好像在找尋什麽似的。</p>
<p>這雖說笑話，却確是實情。我們的國人常是這麽閒散好奇的。</p>
<p>「好奇心」原是發明的動力，但牠需要與「好學」相互並進。我們的國人大都只是單純的「好奇」，而並不「好學」。雖也有人說閒散好奇，是泱泱大國民的風度，但我說這種「不好學」的「好奇心」，正是我們民族最不長進的劣根性！</p>
<h3 id="c256">寫在讀了「怎樣駕馭女人」之後 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 徐步</p>
<p>讀了洪奔君的大作，很覺有些回味；若說女人而可以駕馭，則男子又何嘗不可以駕馭；將來大家起來研究駕馭之術，兩方面形成了顯然的對壘；那末，愛情究竟還有什麽可言，人生不是更機械化了。况且在洪君的大作中，直把女性視成了一個傀儡。在洪君，或許曾受到了一時的剌激，便信口作成這一篇侮辱女性的洋洋大文來、路上不平，旁人監訓，徐步便不得不起來，寫幾句話了。</p>
<p>本來，在現社會中，，不懂愛情的人太多了：所以自由戀愛盛行以來，便因一般人的誤解愛情而發生出許多現實的慘劇。這責任是男女兩方面應該各負其半的。我們不應該因此而懷疑一切的女人是如此；更不應該懷疑到戀愛的眞諦也是如此，而說起戀愛神聖是狗屁的話，不過世上的男女，如洪君這般蔑視情愛的人太多了，所以才時常會發生出用愛情來欺騙人，駕馭人的慘劇，丨丨或許在洪君說起來，是滑稽的笑劇，把戀愛看成了純物質的事情，而想以方術取得，是洪君的一大誤點，雖然，也許一般人的觀念是誠如洪君所說，但怎能說全女界都是這般呢！</p>
<p>在我，以爲戀愛的兩方面是應該互相諒解，互相體貼的。若說因我愛你而嚴束你，便是今人談戀愛的最大誤點；也就是引起對方反感的一大原因。所以，我以爲在兩方面都未完全了解戀愛的眞諦之前，還是不戀愛爲妙。不然，結果還是悲劇，不用說，美滿的家庭是永遠沒有希望的。</p>
<p>講到女人，如洪君所說的固然不少，但不隨流俗的也正很多。不用說，鄕村的女子一大半還有着誠摯的愛情；就是處在浮華的都市中的女子，不如洪君所說的也正多着呢。譬如洪君說：女人喜歡男子們降級相從，不錯！一部分的女子是有這一類的思想，但是，能有幾個女子因你降級相從便會來愛你呢？還不是男子方面故意地把地位來引誘女子嗎？這種男子，根本談不到戀愛。而一般可憐的女子，却確能因虚榮而落進男子們的圈套。這確是一般女子的弱點；然却不是女界共通的弱點。</p>
<p>第三點：洪君說男子的心理不可給女人摸到，一被摸着伊便會向你進攻，逼迫等等的話。本來，這種男女的結合，根本就沒有戀愛的存在，無庸多辯。但洪君的話確有幾分使人不得不說的地方。他這幾句不是全沒理由，不過這幾種話，只能說曾經受過眉語目聽的訓練的，一般賣笑的女人們；而不能批評整個的女界。</p>
<p>再次，洪君說女人愛錢，只要有錢，無論你是個怎樣的男子，她也會和你伴宿「打梆」在這裏，我們可以自見洪君所遇到的不過是一類拜金主義的賣笑的女人們。他根本就不曾見過眞正有人格的女子。在洪君，簡直把女人看成了玩物，丨丨沒有心靈的東西。在這裏，他顯露出了人類猙猙的眞面目；忘記了執筆的地位了。有許多地方，完全是謾駡，也不能細述，只上面幾個例子，已經可以看出洪君說的女人，全是賣笑的蕩婦，以賣笑的蕩婦而拿來比擬女界的面目，是多麽無聊而又可笑的事。</p>
<p>現在，話說完了。最後忠告洪君一句：女人也正和男子一樣，良莠不齊，不能以偏面的觀察來批評整個的女界，若然沒有深切地觀察到具體的面目，還是緘口省事爲是。</p>

<p>— 文黑</p>
<p>起初搬到這新居來的時候，很滿意而且很高興，　新弄堂的新房子，名雖然是呌做亭子間，但那是和前樓房隔着一間洗澡間的亭子間，論面積是比較有的前樓房還要大，而且窗前面有一個富貴人家的别墅的花園，在花園裏頭草木靑葱，花兒越出牆外，還有一個六角亭子。因爲屋子大，便和淸兩人一起住，兩人都是賣文爲生的，脾氣習慣差不多，眞是高興。不料前樓房的人（住的亦是兩個男子漢）有一天晚上，當我正在床上看書要睡的時候，有一個開了洗澡間的門到我們的房間裏頭來，我不知道他要做什麽，想要問他·他先向我說，「昨天晚上六點鐘的時候，有人經過這洗澡間沒有？」這話問得奇怪！他又說，「我們六點鐘的時候出去吃飯，回來不見了一條中國綢褲子！」我想起彷彿昨天晚上是樓下房東在洗澡，而房東太太經過了我們的房間送衣服，便將想起的事告訴他。他說，「有人在洗澡，那難怪！」說着回自已的房間。淸已經睡了，大槪是聽見的·他說，「那裏的窗户是通外面樓梯頭的，恐怕是從窗户進去的。」而我立刻也想起，房東洗澡是前天的事，昨天我從下午出門一直到午夜才回家，一切都不知道，剛才所說不是誣陷了房東发偷竊的罪名嗎？覺得不對，從床上掀開被頭，連外衣都不及穿上便跑到前樓房去。我對那人說，「房東洗澡是前天的事，昨天我不在家不知道。抬頭見了樓下房東丨那成衣舖的學生了站在那裏，我又想起白天那學生子時常跑去開他的房門的事，便告訴了他；回頭又告訴他洗澡間的窗户是通樓梯頭的。學生子和他在伸辯着，我回我們自已的房間，在床上，我又想起剛才提及學生子的事，不是又誣陷了他嗎？立刻感覺到今晚的神經究竟是錯亂了。同時又想起前樓房那人過來向我這事，不是在懷疑我們有偷竊的可能嗎？又是在精神上添上了一層被侮辱的憤惱。想起了同房的淸，······難道他······這不能想。</p>
<p>從那一天晚上起，我的精神上如在受刑。</p>
<p>隔了幾天，我從外面回家，在弄口的黑牌上抬頭看見一張紅紙頭的房子出租帖，「二號前樓出租」，這六個字就好像亦把利刃戳進我的心房丨他們要搬走了，他們要搬走了，天哪，他們是疑心我這亭子間的流浪者是樑上君子之流！　　今天早晨，我在洗澡間洗臉，前樓房那人向我說，「房東要退你的房間是不是」？我說，「沒有喲！」他說，「我們今天搬了。」！天哪，他一直到現在是在疑心我，惱恨我，而且是已經告訴了房東要退我的房間了！而房東一定亦是在疑心我這流浪者是一個樑上君子之流！</p>
<p>這房間，是住不下去了！就是房東不辭退我們，我的精神上的受刑亦是受不了！</p>

<p>— 枬仃</p>
<p>經過三年同居生活之後，我已經嘗够了這「戀愛」的滋味了。</p>
<p>所謂「戀愛的幸福」，只是一種幻象而已。</p>
<p>經濟的壓迫，社會的危機，已經深深的闖進每一個人的「地盤」裏。</p>
<p>在起初，當我開始投入「愛網」的時候，一切映在我眼前都是活潑，新鮮，和諧。可是，經過了三年的生活之後，一切都和以前相反。我們往往因爲一點小小的事，時常吵嘴打架，仇人似的，沒有從前那種互相謙讓的情形了。這樣，我所接觸的周圍，此刻在我看來，都消失了牠們底鮮美與和諧的存在。</p>
<p>由這些日子起，我們彼此的行動，都互相十分明瞭，由於内心的敏感；坐下來時，我曉得她要說些什麽，睡下來時，她明白我要講那一種的話。</p>
<p>她對於任何的事，都生厭了。她常常懊惱，也常常靜悄悄的一個人躺在床上哭。因爲她總喜歡我老獃在家裏伴着她，而我可不能那樣。難道一個人爲成了「家」之後，就非做「家」的一種工具，一種點綴品不成丨或是丨丨一個人，成爲「情侶」，成爲「夫妻」，他或她就非做了他或她的奴隷不可？</p>
<p>這是絶不可能的。</p>
<p>「結緍便是戀愛的墳墓」，這句話是有牠相當的價値的。我感覺，所謂「戀愛」這回事，是有閒階級的玩意兒、特别是小資產階級的玩意兒。</p>
<p>畢竟是苦惱的，想到後，我更加創痛了。</p>
<p>所以，我往往悄悄的一個子跑到郊外去，在豁達的新鮮的田野裏，我躑躅於那廣野的大地上，欣賞着那些靑山綠水，樹木花草，飛禽走獸，大自然之美，把我引入幽淸的境界裏，我不覺嘆息着個人自由生活的幸運。</p>
<p>然而，這種肉體上一時輕鬆的快感，當我重復回到自已那沉悶的「家」時，便像一片五彩的霞雲那樣被東風吹散了。</p>
<p>生活於我是一個苦擔，我明白這是無法逃避的，我已經不是一個童年時代的孩提了。</p>
<p>工作於我是一種使命，我淸楚這是我對於人生必然的一種義務；我已經不是我自已個人了。</p>
<p>「我必須變更變更我生活的形式呀！」踏進「家」門時，瞧着那愁眉苦臉底老等着我回家的自已的妻，我深深的這麽嘆了口長氣。</p>
<p>她瞟了我一眼，這似乎在責備我不應把她孤零零的丢在這冷空空的房子裏。</p>
<p>我並沒有理會她，便懶巴巴的躺上床上來。瞧瞧天花板，瞧瞧這空虚和沉悶的小房子，想到這生活，我不覺抖震了一下之後，又默默地想：</p>
<p>「愛」於我是憎恨的！</p>
<p>「生」於我是厭惡的！</p>
<p>然而，我不得不生，她也不得不愛，我們是活着愛着，人不是富於感情的動物嗎？</p>
<p>可是，我們畢竟很苦惱，在窮窘與憂鬱的愛裏，我們不是正在掙扎着嗎？　　經過三年愛的生活之後，我已經受到愛的苦味了，我沒有愛了，我不能愛了；我討厭愛！這時，我覺得有件事比愛更重大更迫切更有意義。</p>

<p>— 子午</p>
<p>天眞的小孩子絶不會想到人生這會事，年老的人也不願再發出對人生的疑問：究竟爲些什麽？唯有靑年的，壯年的，鑽在這悶胡蘆内拚其全力想打出來。一時很安靜的過着活着，一時便擾動起來，喊道「人生究竟爲的什麽？」丨丨這時，該是極苦悶的一刹那。</p>
<p>苦悶的時候多，心的深處便永無寗時。</p>
<p>道德的人生觀，宗敎的人生觀，早已鼓不起他們生命之力，拉不住他們的幻想。他們祈禱着一個團結的生活，同時又想發展自已個人的人格；他們懷疑這時代這社會，但又不敢確信自已有改造的能力：他們切求充實現實的生命，同時並追懷，羨慕已過去的。一句話：他們都不滿於目前的生活，但不知何從改善起。</p>
<p>譬如說社會主義，太冷酷，個人主羣，未免太放任；現實的人生觀罷，根本上卽懷疑着人生；自然的人生觀罷，又不甘於寂寞：再，所謂眞愛的人生觀，眞理的人生觀罷，則在這個世界上就找不到一些一微的眞愛和眞理。</p>
<p>他們什麽都想要，同時什麽也不要，他們要的都是過去的和未來的，所不要的祇有屬於現在。然則，他們現在有此什麽？</p>
<p>擾動，擾動，苦悶又加重了一層，人生的悶胡蘆還是沒有從裏面打出來。終於是懷疑，怨恨，幻滅把人往頽廢的一條路上推去。</p>
<p>曾經有一位朋友對我說，假使要知道「人生究竟爲的什麽，」祇須自殺，但是，這話往那裏說起呢？</p>
<p>人生，人生，哲學對於現代靑年人的解釋，已是精疲力盡，無所致其用了。</p>

<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>「上海居，大不易。」這句話是最確切不過的，吾這樣想。不過，這在那些住洋房的人們，當然不成什麽問題；但在一般的小市民及勞動階級，和薪給生活者看來，却着實有些害怕！因房金一項的支出，至少要佔去一家全部開銷的三分之一强，就是拿吾自已來說吧！住了一問交通，空氣，都不如意的亭子間，每月就須七大元，七大元便是吾一個月全部收入的三分之一，其餘三分之二的支配，吃，穿，應酬，醫藥，及其他一切雜項，都得包刮在内，所以吾現在整天的鬧着窮。</p>
<p>一個月七大元，一年十二個月，計算起來就要八十四元。八十四元，在鄕村裏或許有一二畝田或地可買了。然而，在上海祇能租到一塊像豆腐干大小的地方；裏面擱了一只舖和擺了一只小檯子，就什麽東西都沒有地方安插了。因此吾現在常常厭惡着都市生活，而極想住到農村裏去，但生活告訴吾說；不可能的，不可能的。</p>
<p>在不久的以前，有人因鑒於房租的日見增加，一般市民及商店，都將有不勝負擔之苦，大上海的前途，已有落沉之勢，爲欲復興上海市面計，繁榮都市商業計，遂發起了一個「减租運動委員會」，一時風起雲湧，前呼後應，各路各里，都相繼而起；於似乎减租之聲浪</p>

<p>，把整個的大上海　撼得　　起來。可是，亦僅曇花一現。然而這樣一來，倒給幾位大律師們，推廣了一大批額外的營業，聰明的律師們，當然不肯放過這個時機，便印就了一大批警告信，催租信的格式；需用時祇須將當事人，租金額，收信者的字樣塡進就得，反正是千篇一律的刻板文章。</p>
<p>法庭上，也平添了不知幾許欠租的民事訟案。</p>
<p>本來，錢可以通神，房客們這班螻蟻之輩，自然不會擱在他們的心上。</p>
<p>講到他們的對策，不外乎三種方式：第一種，房客如果一定要减租的，不减不付，那麽，他們乾脆不來收取，俟過了相當時期，便請求法律的帮助，來替他們追取所欠的房租，一分一毫也不怕你們短少了。第二種，是用斷水斷絶交通的硬辣手段來壓迫房客，水和交通二者，皆屬日常生活上，一時一刻也不可缺少的必需品。把這二樣的來源壟斷了，那不怕你們不去和他們妥恊，等妥恊的時候，他們便是得到了勝利的微笑。第三種，是最後的一着，將原有的房產出賣或抵押出去，由得主來聲明翻造，和勒迫遷移。還有幾個喪心病狂的業主，竟戤了洋商的牌頭來壓迫房客。</p>
<p>再說到另一方面，在農村破落了的今日，整批，整批的鄕下人，都做着黃金都市的夢，而流進了都市裏來，於是使都市社會的消費和生產，在在發生着不可避免的，不恊調的衝突，金融界，銀行界的投資目光，却避開了商業實業而傾向於房產業，致使上海的市面成了不平衡的，畸形的發展，地產價格的提高，房租的增加是必然的事實。雖然，最近由於减租運動會的引起，再受了市民聯合會的推動，而各路各里的市民，都繼續着組織了减租支分會，可是，减租運動儘着一天一天的鬧下去。結果，還是不能减輕市民一分一毫的擔負，糾紛却一天一天的擴大開去，住的問題也如終不能解决。因爲法律是决不會因了市面不景氣而帮房客的，欠了租，當然要還，不還，少不了就要封門。</p>

<p>生下來就沒有家鄕。</p>
<p>遍天涯，他流浪着，不停止的永遠地流浪着，從這裏到那裏。</p>
<p>也是偶然吧！他停留在我們這裏了。</p>
<p>身上，圍了不知什麽地方討得的破襖，一條時常帶在身邊的竹桿，赤脚地，從能够記憶的時候起，他認識自已從來沒有改樣過，他已活過來二十多年，他沒有積得一文錢，他的生活是得一天天喊着嘴吧的。可是，他這張嘴吧又不會伶俐，因爲他太不知道「說好話」了。　　他這張不會伶俐的嘴吧，眞呌他吃虧，往往沒有討得點飯或粥，初換來一面冷臉孔·碰了發癖氣的人，迎頭就給你一頓駡，這樣，他都忍受了。肚子餓沒辦法，只得沿門討過去。</p>
<p>向上進的心理，有一個時候源源地激動過他，「他自已不是剛二十開外的靑年嗎？自已是有力氣的，應該找來正當的生活云，」可是接着的難題又使他發悶了，百業凋零的現代往那裏去呢？又誰能容納他一個乞丐呢？</p>
<p>然而他生活着，是一天天喊着嘴吧的。</p>
<p>他沒有别的乞丐般優裕，他知道，他是何等恨這張不會伶俐的嘴吧哪！</p>
<p>在巷角，他瘋狂地唱起歪調了。於是，一羣孩子圍攏來，指點他說：「瘋丐」</p>
<p>他感到劇烈的痛苦時，他便唱，大寒天，嗚嗚咽咽地，風送來那麽哀怨悲凉的音調。</p>
<p>他要生活，他不得不生活，惟是他找求生活的手段是低能，一次，走過晒滿人家衣裳的地方，這白色的衣叢，分明地把他怎樣找求生活的思想搖動了，眼前，這個機會，輕利而神妙的，可以滿足幾天來的慾望，他遲疑着，他終於拉下一件綢衣翻轉身預備跑了。忽然那兒門口追上了一個人，糢糊裏他覺得柱般粗的門閂攔腰抽過來，「偷！你偷！」那麽嚴厲的呼叱聲。</p>
<p>現在，他不會出來求乞了，再不會出來求那殘忍的人類無限止的打駡而換來的少數剩飯了，他伏在一座古廟門首，那鬆亂的稻草堆上，撫摩他爲想滿足一點生活而得到的創傷，他想起了家，想起了母親，他哭泣，不敢高聲地，他低微在咽泣。</p>

<p>— 容熙</p>
<p>爹要到城裏去了！講起城裏，小傻子的心裏不禁的又羨慕呐！</p>
<p>記得城裏有四輪的汽車，馬車，商店的門口有轉的顏色燈······名目多着呢！眞的，小傻子願一輩子住在那兒！</p>
<p>晚上，爹回家了。小傻子的眼光釘着爹的面孔，爹的臉上沒有往昔的微笑了，老是陰沉着！鐵靑色的。</p>
<p>這兩個月來，爹沒有到廠裏去了，他天天到街頭踱着。也不像往昔回家的時候，手裏總帶着好喫的東西。小傻子會拿到放在自家的小籃内，爹撫他的烏髮，臉上浮出一些和靄友愛的微笑。現在却不同呐！小傻子見着父親回來，他會害怕的倒退幾步！</p>
<p>這時媽盯着爹，小傻子也盯着爹，爹老垂着頭，屋裏怪悽凉的！</p>
<p>「如何······」</p>
<p>媽說，抖抖地。</p>
<p>爹不作聲，祇搖着腦袋。</p>
<p>小傻子覺得古怪，爹眞像强盜見官那麽的，從前爹不是有說有笑？！</p>
<p>「媽，爹受了誰的氣？」</p>
<p>媽也如爹那麽的，不作聲。媽的眼珠發亮了。小傻子始終也得不着這個謎底。</p>
<p>「一個人失了業，眞是一切希望都完了。」</p>
<p>媽嗚咽起來。</p>
<p>小傻子不相信，爹那樣好的人會沒有事做！爹不出去玩女人，不喫烟，不賭。眞的，他相信爹是沒有一點兒瑕點的好人！媽的唇又顫動，還是那麽抖抖地：</p>
<p>「還是到城裏去向叔叔借一點吧。」　　小傻子聽見到城里去，冷靜的心又興奮了。爹多回是說到城裏去，終沒有去成。他懷疑的望着爹。</p>
<p>「沒法呐，媽的，託人找事那麽難！借也怕是枉然的······」</p>
<p>爹顯然是發怒了，小傻子有點害怕起來。然而，希望終於勝過懼怕。他要求說：</p>
<p>「媽，媽，我要去。」</p>
<p>媽沒有表示，媽僅淡淡地說：</p>
<p>「媽不去，你也不要去吧。」</p>
<p>停停，媽又接着說：</p>
<p>「爹現在沒多的錢，過些時到有事做再帶你去。」</p>
<p>小傻子一股熱情，突地消滅了。僅剩着一絲的懼怕！他望着爹鐵靑的面孔，他也沒有這種膽子再說去了。</p>
<p>大淸早，小傻子就爬起來，爹喫了幾個河南餅，背上包裏，正要走的時候，媽說：</p>
<p>「你向他說點自家哀苦。」</p>
<p>爹點點頭，戴上那頂破氈帽走了。　　「媽，爹去向叔叔借錢麽？」</p>
<p>媽的勞苦的手撫着小傻子的頭髮，小傻子感覺百般的溫存，媽呆呆地望着爹的背影，眼淚　　地掉下來，媽是楞住了。</p>

<p>— 雲山</p>
<p>八·南方人在長安</p>
<p>「到西北去！」</p>
<p>這呼聲的響亮新頴，不减於當年北伐時代，「到民間去！」到農村去！的革命狂潮。</p>
<p>我眞的到了「西北」了。而且看見許多的南方人，已先我而在此「安居樂業！」他們中自然有許多是客居已久，幾與地方同化的小工商業者。也有許多是因政治的變遷，得以彚緣　貴。</p>
<p>偶經街頭巷尾，得聞幾聲吳儂軟語，我這客地孤寂的遊人，眞有「他鄕遇故知」樣的快樂！及至仔細一看：不行！人家是那麽豪華尊貴的氣派，你這小癟三如何軋得上？結果，還是自漸形穢，吐口唾沫走了開去！</p>
<p>騎馬郊遊，在這古城四週應有特殊的風味，可是我沒有機會眞的去領略。當此陽春三月，北地風光尙好的時節，每於落日斜暉之中，看見二三妙齡女郎，丨丨當然也是南方來的！輕裝淡抺的招展於高頭駿馬之上。用一句聊齋上的成語：「途人目逆而送之」之後，總難免有幾句不關緊要的閑評：</p>
<p>『還是我們南方女人漂亮！你看：她騎在馬上多美！』開小店的南方人，勾起了江南春色的回戀。</p>
<p>『稀奇？那不過是「夫榮妻貴」的老把戲！』另一個商人憤然的說：</p>
<p>『這又不知是那位老爺的姨太太？她們的福氣多好！······』馬路上的苦力自嘆不如！</p>
<p>九·視察西北的要人們</p>
<p>要人們的視察西北，不是爲了陪都的建設，就是爲了農村的開發；再不然或者由於飲水思源的情愫，特地跑回「老家」去上墳。（西北是漢族歷史上的老家。）</p>
<p>關於陪都的建設，我看見已有一塊「西京籌備委員會」的木牌，不知成立過多時了。關於回「老家」上墳，則例證繁多，不勝枚舉。惟有開發農村的建設，因爲隴海鐵路潼西段的工程，已經具體進行，的確表現了些新的氣象。</p>
<p>第一，長安的地主們，將從前城内外棄置的荒地，都築起了無數的土圍，以明主權所在。他們最大的希望是通車後，地價高漲，得以大發財源！</p>
<p>第二，旅館業有蒸蒸日上之勢，東大街西京飯店對面，新建築了一座華麗的樓房，將來營業，當比現在的西北大飯店更爲發達。</p>
<p>第三，在三原籌辦的裕秦紡織公司，和在武功建造的國立西北農林專校，均與西北民生關係密切。</p>
<p>第四，列强的勢力，將隨着中國内地交通的發展，而更加深入到西北農村的底層，無遠弗届！</p>
<p>總之，「道高一尺，魔高一丈！」一切事是相對的。開發西北，對内，必須注意實惠及於小民。對外，必須預防列强將來的禍害。</p>
<p>「謹防扒犇！」願以此四字贈諸實當其責者！丨丨丨完丨丨丨</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese stationed in Yuguan received a report stating that Prince Chichibu intended not to come to Yuguan and had canceled his inspection of the Great Wall passes. Therefore, the welcome preparations by the Japanese and Chinese traitors in Yuguan have been halted.

The proposers are Usami, Director of the South Manchuria Railway Bureau, and Ota, Director of the Fengtian Railway Bureau. It is currently unknown which method will be adopted. General observation suggests that the international travel agency method is more appropriate. Japanese representatives, Director Usami of the South Manchuria Railway Bureau and Ota, are actively preparing for various matters related to the through train service. The Shahekou Railway Factory, operated by the South Manchuria Railway, is rushing to build carriages, having already completed eleven passenger cars and twenty-four freight cars. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan and Qin Dechun returned to Chahar this afternoon, accompanied by Tang Yulin. Song said that whether or not they will make a tour after arriving in Chahar will be decided later. Whether or not to go to Ganzhou to meet Chiang will be determined after receiving a telegram from Chiang. There are more than 50 types of excessive and petty taxes and levies in Chahar Province that should be abolished, but the method of funding after the abolition will be planned as a whole after I return to Chahar. Regarding De Wang's request to restore the Chahar Mongolian banner system, I believe that the situation in Inner Mongolia is different from that in Outer Mongolia. The security of Inner Mongolia is already the full responsibility of the local government. Under the current situation of peaceful coexistence, there is no need to restore the old system. Tang said that my return to Chahar is to take care of private affairs. In the future, I plan to travel frequently between Beiping and Zhangjiakou and have not made preparations to reside in Tianjin. The real estate in Beiping has been negotiated several times and can now be returned. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) After being arrested, Deng Tiemei, Commander-in-Chief of the Liaoning Self-Defense Army, was escorted to the Shenyang Army Prison by more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers on the 4th, guarded by a small squad of Japanese soldiers. Officials of the puppet state and Japanese who admired Deng's name came to visit one after another. Deng remained silent except for talking to one or two people with some character. He had not eaten for several days after entering the prison. The Japanese sent several tables of banquets, but he refused to eat, saying that a good man does not eat the food of a puppet state. He directly rebuked the puppet officials for their shameless service to the enemy, causing those who heard it to avoid him in shame. Although Deng had not eaten for several days, his spirit was still good. The Japanese tried to force Deng to write a letter to recruit his subordinates, but he refused. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Deng Tiemei was arrested on the morning of June 1. Deng went to the home of Zhang, his concubine's father, in Xiaozhangjiabao, Fengcheng, to recuperate due to illness. Zhang, greedy for the 50,000 yuan reward, secretly reported to Li Shoushan of the 2nd Brigade of the Fengcheng Garrison, who sent plainclothes to arrest him. After capturing him, they hid him in the mountains and forests for three days to prevent Deng's troops from robbing him. On the morning of the 4th, a large contingent of Japanese troops opened up to respond and escorted him to Shenyang by special train. He passed the Lian Shan Pass, only half an hour apart, and was not chased and intercepted by Deng's troops. After arriving in Shenyang, although the people were under the pressure of the Japanese, tens of thousands of people still crowded the streets to watch this heroic righteous army. Deng remained calm and fearless. Currently, rumors are rife in Shenyang, saying that Deng's troops have infiltrated the city to rob the prison. Therefore, the searches on the streets are very strict, and pedestrians are cut off after 8:00 PM. After Deng was arrested, his troops were commanded by Commander Ren Fuxiang, Wang Xiaodong, Li Fashan, Pang Jingtai, and Yun, with a total of 40,000 men. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to news from the Kwantung Army, at 8:30 AM on the 10th of this month, a large contingent of Japanese troops attacked the righteous army in Toudaogou, Eastern Border Road.

<p>(Shenyang) Deng Tiemei, the leader of the righteous army in the Shenyang-Fengtian line area, was arrested by the puppet army near Fenghuangcheng. He was escorted to the Shenyang puppet garrison command on the 4th of this month and interrogated by Japanese and puppet military officers for days, trying to get Deng to reveal the base of the righteous army and the source of their guns and ammunition. However, Deng firmly refused to enter the shell, only admitting that he was the commander-in-chief of the Liaodong Righteous Army, and that he had resigned in March. Deng also shouted that the activities of the righteous army were carrying out the responsibilities of the Chinese people, and that the anti-Japanese ideology came from patriotism. The Japanese and puppets are still strictly prohibiting Deng from being executed. (12th Hualian News)</p>

Because he does not want Western medical treatment, he decided to hire a Chinese medicine doctor to serve as the imperial physician in the puppet palace. He specially sent Pu Guang, son of Zai Xun, to Beiping to hire one. It is heard that Puyi originally intended to hire two famous doctors from Beiping, but they have declined, unwilling to take this pseudo-position in Changchun.

(12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent personnel to Shanghai on the 12th to meet with Japanese Minister Ariyoshi to convey the government's concern about the disappearance of Vice-Consul Kuramoto and the fact that the military police have been doing their best to investigate for days, and to request the Japanese side to remain calm.

Because although there has always been contact between the military police, they were still concerned that the area was vast and that the distribution of personnel might be uneven, and the considerations might not be comprehensive. Therefore, they jointly planned to divide the entire area into several districts, allocate uniformed and plainclothes personnel as appropriate, and carry out the work, and implemented it closely on the 11th. 1.

<p>(Beiping) After the Japanese forcibly occupied the Northeast, in addition to using military and political oppression, they also used various organizations to fool the people and maintain public support. 1. The East Asia National Alliance, organized by the Japanese Huang Mu, under the name of organizing the East Asia National Alliance Army, reorganized the troops, but in reality, it was a Japanese-controlled organization, used to detect the inside situation of the Righteous Army. 2. The Righteousness Group, initiated by the Japanese Sakai Eizo, aimed to deceive the people of the puppet state to work for the puppet Wangdao and strive to popularize its power. There were 2 million members in various places, but the organization was not strict and was strongly opposed by the people. 3. The Cooperative Association, whose purpose was to promote mutual cooperation among the people of the Northeast and loyalty to the puppet state. The president was the Chinese traitor Zheng Xiaoxu. Most of the members were officials of various provinces, counties, and cities, about more than one million. There were some Japanese inside. 4. The Jiali Sect, a revolutionary organization from the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, was later used by the Qing court and changed to the Qing Gang. The Japanese also used its power after invading the Northeast to maintain stability. Many people from the middle and lower levels of society, military and police in various provinces and counties joined it. There were many Japanese inside, totaling 5 million members. In May last year, the Japanese ordered the puppet state to send more than ten representatives of the Jiali Sect from the puppet capital to Japan to meet the Emperor to increase their pro-Japanese sentiments. However, the Jiali Sect was Han Chinese and could not be induced by the Japanese. 5. The Japan-Manchuria Friendship Association, whose purpose was to make the people of the Northeast tend to be pro-Japanese. The general assembly was in Fengtian, and branches were in various Japanese and puppet places. Although there were nearly one million members, their activities were technically naive. 6. The Japan-Manchuria Women's Association was formed by the Japanese sending their knowledgeable and experienced women to join with the wives of various puppet officials. It was planned to make the puppet women believe in Japanese Shinto, and to teach their children, and indirectly soften the bureaucrats. It can be seen that the Japanese are meticulous in their intentions. 7. The Respect for the Elderly Association: The Japanese ordered the elderly from various counties and villages to go to Changchun to meet Puyi, give them awards and propaganda, so that when they return to their hometowns, they secretly spread the benevolent governance of the puppet Wangdao. 8. The Humanity Love and Kindness Association originated in Japan. Most of the people who joined were from the middle and lower classes, and its power was inferior to other associations.

<p>(Nanjing) Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, believes that opium suppression is a consistent policy of the party, and that no matter what difficulties are encountered in fact, it is absolutely not allowed to change course midway. Currently, local administrative agencies often change the name for special reasons, still using the name of opium suppression, and secretly implementing methods of protection, while the courts enforce the law with ropes, making it inconvenient to show any leniency, resulting in contradictions in government orders from time to time. He specifically petitioned the Central Government to adopt a six-year opium suppression plan, refer to the opium suppression regulations promulgated by the Commander-in-Chief of the Encirclement of Bandits in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui on April 3 last year, separately enact a special opium suppression law, and temporarily suspend the application of Article 19 of the Criminal Law regarding opium crimes, in order to eliminate the malpractice of private transportation and trafficking, and to eliminate the gaps in judicial administration, so that the harm that has accumulated over the years can be completely eradicated, and the party's opium suppression policy can be implemented.

<p>(Nanjing) Railway Officer Zeng Zhongming said, 1. Regarding the Zhengtai Road loan, there are many rumors outside, and it is heard that the Control Yuan has filed an impeachment against Minister Gu, but the Ministry has not yet received any formal letters or documents from the Control Yuan, so it is impossible to express an attitude on this matter. 2. Managing the Pingsui Railway debt is a matter within the Ministry and has nothing to do with the Nishihara loan. The true facts were published in writing last month. 3. Electric trains are used in various European and American countries recently, which is very convenient. The Ministry also plans to try it out, but because a large amount of money is needed, the national treasury is currently strained, and it is not easy to implement it for a while. 4. Whether to purchase the No. 2 ferry for the capital depends on the actual needs and is still under study. 5. The 3rd Railway Exhibition will be held in Beiping.

<h3 id="e23">Recent Changes in the European Situation <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>In recent days, the situation in Europe has become tense due to the convening of the Disarmament Conference. It started with the confrontation between Germany and France, followed by disagreements between Britain and France. The frightening nature of the situation is truly reminiscent of the eve of the First World War in 1914. However, not long after, Britain and France shook hands and made peace, reaffirming their cooperation, which allowed the disarmament conference, which was on the verge of collapse, to maintain a glimmer of hope. The deteriorating relationship between France and Germany also showed signs of change. According to recent European dispatches, in addition to Britain and France seeking renewed cooperation, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has also stepped forward to seek a resolution with the German and French authorities. At the same time, the Little Entente's recognition of Soviet Russia has also been established. The speed of changes in the situation has exceeded expectations. However, there are reasons why European countries have pulled back from the brink and are unwilling to quickly create a second world war. The reasons can be summarized in several points.</p>
<p>(1) France has always relied on Britain to assert its influence against Germany. If it loses Britain's sympathy, its power to restrain Germany will be difficult. However, since the Great War, France has been strong and Germany has been weak, so Britain has often suppressed France and helped Germany between the two countries. Even after Hitler came to power, Britain's attitude remained the same. The key to the growing discord between British and French opinions and the growing closeness between French and Russian relations lies in this. If Britain could show a little concession to France, France would rather maintain Britain's goodwill. If Britain can cooperate with France, France's benefits will not only be in Europe, but its position in the Far East can also be maintained. For France, weighing the situation, if it loses Britain and gains Russia, it can certainly restrain Germany in Europe, but its Annam in the Far East will inevitably be threatened by Japan. The French are deeply concerned about this. Therefore, although they have been on the same wavelength with the Russians at the Disarmament Conference, their attitude is also very flexible. As soon as the US representative's mediation arrived, they immediately expressed concessions to Britain, passing a compromise proposal to re-invite Germany. Their intention to not lose Britain by gaining Russia is very clear.</p>
<p>(2) If the union of France and Russia becomes a reality, Britain's situation will be very difficult. Li Weinuofu's proposal includes: one, to conclude a mutual assistance pact; two, to define the definition of aggression; and three, to implement sanctions against aggressor nations. His intention is clearly to bind Britain when Germany invades Russia or attacks France, in order to fight against Germany. If this kind of pact is expanded and implemented in the Far East, then in the event of a Russo-Japanese war, Britain will again bear the responsibility of sanctioning Japan. All of these would make British policy subject to others and lose its opportunity to be flexible and benefit from the situation. Moreover, if France and Russia form a group and fight against the group of Japan and Germany, Britain would not want to help France and Russia fight Germany in Europe, nor would it bother to oppose Japan for Russia in the Far East. Therefore, for Britain's own sake, it is actually not conducive to close cooperation between France and Russia. At this Disarmament Conference, the reason why the British were able to abandon their opinions, turn the tide, and rejoin forces with France was to make France slightly distance itself from its relationship with Russia and not allow Soviet Russia's proposals to be fully realized.</p>
<p>(3) Mussolini is watching intently and observing the changes. He is constantly thinking of using the contradictions between France and Germany and the divisions between Britain and France to expand his group diplomacy since the Austro-Hungarian union. Now, Mr. Mussolini has taken advantage of the disarmament stalemate and stepped forward to invite the responsible authorities from both sides to Italy for consultations. Although this move is nominally mediation, it is difficult to guarantee that there are no other intentions. It may be to recruit Germany and expand the established group, or it may not be known. Furthermore, observing the French Foreign Minister's reluctance to go to Italy, the French are probably already wary of this. If this kind of speculation is not too far off, then today's sudden turn of the Little Entente to recognize Soviet Russia is not without reason. The interests of Austria-Hungary and the Little Entente are inherently contradictory. Since the Austro-Hungarian union, the reason why they have been able to coexist peacefully is because Italy and Germany are suspicious of each other. If the meeting between Mr. Mussolini and Hitler is successful, then the threat to the Little Entente and France will far exceed that of the Austro-German merger. The reason why France today wants to ally with Russia but cannot bear to lose the goodwill of Britain must be related to this.</p>
<p>The situation in Europe is already so complex, and the interests and viewpoints of various countries in the Far East are so different. Under these circumstances, France's relationship with Russia cannot but be kept within limits. If it does not reach the point of despair, it must prioritize maintaining friendship with Britain. However, in order to strengthen international influence, it must still use Soviet Russia to assert its own importance. This is one point. If cooperation between Britain and France can continue, then the League of Nations will certainly still exist. There is still plenty of room for twists and turns in disarmament negotiations. The outbreak of war in Europe can be delayed as a result. This is the second point. As for Germany, if it joins the group of Italy, Austria-Hungary, and it is thought for Germany, there are very few options left for Germany. Germany's demands today are indeed for rearmament. However, the purpose of rearmament must be to seek the recovery of lost territory and the expansion of territory. In this regard, how will the Germans deal with France? In our opinion, the disparity in strength between Germany and France is too great, so they will not easily start a war. As for Poland, they have just signed a ten-year non-aggression treaty, so they will not immediately turn their backs. However, the Baltic countries are small and weak, and it is not difficult to invade them. Lithuania, in particular, is the target of the Germans. Therefore, once Japan and Russia are at war, Germany may take the opportunity to move eastward to launch an invasion of Soviet Russia. It is not impossible. The reason why Soviet Russia is now eagerly conspiring with France to conclude an Eastern European non-aggression pact is to preemptively prevent Germany from taking advantage of others' dangers for its own benefit. With Li Weinuofu's flexible diplomatic skills, Soviet Russia's attempt has a hope of success. Therefore, if the Russo-Japanese war does not break out immediately, Soviet Russia has plenty of time to deal with it calmly. If so, then Germany's way out will still not be able to be opened. This is the third point. Looking at this kind of mutually restrictive relationship, we can see that although the situation in Europe is extremely tense, it is not about to start a war. However, if we think that the European situation has a peaceful atmosphere, it is inevitable that we are too optimistic.</p>

<p>Next Year's Naval Disarmament Conference</p>
<h3 id="e24">Britain to Propose Restrictions on Military Aircraft; Expected to be Opposed by the United States; Preliminary Negotiations Between Britain, America, and Japan to Begin Next Week; Italy to Proceed with Shipbuilding Plans; Caused by Japan and France's Competitive Expansion of Their Navies <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Preparations for the naval disarmament preliminary conference between Britain, the United States, and Japan are ready. According to Ambassador Matsudaira's report to the Foreign Ministry on the 11th, British Foreign Minister Simon, US Ambassador Bingham, and Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira are scheduled to begin talks next week, regardless of whether they have received responses from France and Italy. It is expected that these talks will proceed smoothly. (Nihon Rengo Tsushin dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources today, Britain may request restrictions on naval military aircraft at next year's naval disarmament conference. Britain has not yet specifically stated its position on this important issue. The United States is said to be opposing this. US naval officials insist that the idea of ​​air forces flying across the ocean to bomb enemy cities is an exaggeration, because a large base is needed near the attack location, and battleships must protect it in order to succeed. The naval authorities of Japan and the United States are now preparing new funds to enrich their coastal defense air forces, while Britain is allowing its air force to lag behind and has now fallen to fourth or fifth place. Britain once hoped that the Disarmament Conference would restrict military aircraft. The General Disarmament Committee has now appointed a special committee to study this matter. Impartial observers here believe that civil aircraft can be easily converted for military use, which is the difficulty in managing naval military aircraft. Commercial airfields can also be converted into military airfields. Therefore, the establishment of air force bases in trustee islands and the Aleutian Islands will cause unrest in the Pacific. It is said that several trustee islands have already begun to build commercial airfields, and the base in the Aleutian Islands is being considered. (Guomin News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>The Italian government in Rome has begun construction of two 35,000-ton armored cruisers, estimated to cost 100 million lire and take four years to complete. According to Italy's original shipbuilding plan, in addition to this, there are also six 6,000-ton to 7,000-ton armored cruisers, four destroyers, four small torpedo boats, and twelve submarines. (Havas dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) An evening newspaper explained the reason why Italy is building two 35,000-ton armored cruisers, saying that Italy originally had the right to build two ships. The reason why they have not yet started construction is to take into account the disarmament conference. Now, not only has the disarmament conference in Geneva not achieved anything, but the Washington Naval Treaty has also gone bankrupt. The results of previous naval conferences have not only failed to eliminate the factors of mutual suspicion and competition between the signatory countries, but the navies of various countries have increased as a result. The naval conference originally took the British Navy as the maximum limit, thinking that it could not be exceeded. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Navy was originally inferior to the British Navy, but it has gradually increased since the naval conference and is now equal to the British Navy. (Havas dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Official circles are paying close attention to Italy's construction of two 35,000-ton armored cruisers. It is generally believed that Italy did not sign the London Naval Treaty, so it has the right to build large tonnage warships. No one has any objection to this matter. However, the general opinion is that if what Italy is doing is the beginning of a new shipbuilding policy, then Britain's plan to prepare for preliminary negotiations at the 1935 naval conference may be greatly revised as a result, and Britain's policy before and during the naval conference will be considerably affected by Italy's new policy. The country directly affected by Italy's shipbuilding plan is France, because the reason why the French government failed to recognize the 1930 London Naval Treaty was that Italy demanded equality with the French Navy. This time, Italy's shipbuilding plan is a re-raising of the naval equality issue. (Havas dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<p>After the General Committee of the Reuters Disarmament Conference met today, it elected representatives of European countries to form a Security Committee to consider the issue of regional security pacts in accordance with the tripartite compromise resolution passed last Friday. However, Hungary and Italy both stated that they reserved their positions and were only observers. The chairman of today's General Committee meeting was the Greek politician Politis, who was elected on the proposal of Henderson. The only diplomatic officials who attended the meeting were the Soviet Union's Li Weinuofu, who did not arrive until half an hour after the meeting began. Mr. Li said that he hoped that the security pact would include countries outside Europe in the future, not only regionally but universally. Mrs. Axu Pei, a well-known social affairs expert, who has represented Britain at the Disarmament Conference for more than two years, read an article stating that Britain could not participate in any pact other than the Locarno Pact. Henderson then stated that he would send the Soviet Union's proposal to change the Disarmament Conference into a permanent organization called the "Peace Conference" to the governments concerned, and also said that if the negotiations between the governments regarding Germany's return to the conference could not achieve the desired progress, he intended to convene the main leaders to discuss the matter. The General Committee then announced an indefinite adjournment at 5:20 p.m., after deliberating for one hour and thirty-five minutes.</p>
<p>(Reuters dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference met, chaired by Henderson. The various committees were immediately organized according to the compromise proposal made by Bartou to carry out their work. (1) The Security Committee, composed of representatives of European countries, was chaired by the Greek representative, Politis. Countries outside Europe were welcome to participate. (2) The Second Committee discussed issues related to monitoring and guaranteeing the implementation of the disarmament treaty, chaired by the Belgian representative, Poolgan. (3) The Third Committee studied aviation issues, chaired by the Spanish representative, Madariaga. (4) The Fourth Committee studied the manufacture and sale of weapons, chaired by the Danish representative, Skavenius. As for the Soviet Union's proposal to change the Disarmament Conference into a "Permanent Conference for Guaranteeing Peace," it was immediately sent to various governments for their opinions. The organization of the Security Committee aroused reservations from various parties. The first was Hungarian representative General Donaz, who said that a security pact could not be established without leaving the nature of the world, and said that he would participate in the work of the Security Committee as an observer. The second was Italian representative Sulania, who said that when the resolution proposed by France was passed by the General Committee by a majority, the Italian delegation was not among those who approved it. Therefore, the Italian representative would also participate in the Security Committee as an observer. The third was British representative Asbi, who said that although Britain sent personnel to participate in the Security Committee, it believed that Britain did not necessarily have to participate in any new regional security pacts established in Europe in the future. French representative Massigli declared that the French delegation acknowledged its participation in the Security Committee and said, "Cooperation in good faith from all parties is not without benefit. The attitude adopted by the Italian delegation stems from the country's principles regarding the entire work of the Disarmament Conference. As for the Hungarian representative, he deeply hoped that he would understand the benefits of the Security Committee and actively participate in it. Soviet representative Li Weinuofu said that the European Security Pact does not exclude other pacts, just as regional treaties can still be separately signed by various countries in addition to a globally concluded pact. The suggestion made by Chairman Henderson was thus passed. It was decided that the draft convention drafted by the special committee, which contained a form for various military expenditures, should be reported by the governments of various countries to the Disarmament Conference in accordance with the form. The Presidium would reconvene after the actions of the various governments were clear. However, if the various countries procrastinate, the Presidium should still convene. When the meeting was adjourned, Henderson said that he warmly hoped that the various governments would take action so that the disarmament issue could be resolved, and Germany could return to Geneva.

<p>(Geneva) The committee of the Disarmament Conference that studies the issue of monitoring armaments and guaranteeing the implementation of the disarmament treaty, chaired by the Belgian representative Poolgan, is scheduled to begin its meetings starting this Wednesday. The committee dealing with security issues will meet in the middle of next week. It is generally believed that the Aviation Issues Committee will be able to meet at the beginning of July, after French Foreign Minister Bartou goes to Britain. (Havas dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times today published an editorial expressing satisfaction with the efforts to maintain the Disarmament Conference, saying that if the Disarmament Conference were to dissolve, it would be difficult to reopen negotiations. The newspaper further stated that the resolution passed in Geneva on Friday mentioned the British, German, French, and Italian communiques, in which three countries recognized Germany's right to restore considerable armaments. Therefore, the French government must deeply consider Germany's proposal to restore armaments. If Germany's right to establish self-defense armaments is not recognized, then disarmament has no hope of concluding a convention. If that is the case, then an arms race is its only way out, which is beneficial to countries with substantial national power, but not beneficial to countries with budgets that are not.

<p>(Washington) An Associated Press reporter learned from responsible sources today that government officials here are trying to dissuade President Roosevelt from meeting with Japanese political leaders during his tour of the Hawaiian Islands. It is said that the President's tour of Honolulu on the cruiser Indianapolis is purely recreational and should not be mixed with political issues. Since President Roosevelt took office, he has been working harder than ordinary people. For the sake of national interests, it is necessary for him to have a short period of rest. Therefore, a meeting between politicians from the United States and Japan will have changes. The idea of ​​a US-Japan meeting originated on Saturday, saying that a personal conversation between President Roosevelt and the Japanese Prime Minister or Foreign Minister might resolve the pending issues between the two countries. As of yesterday, government officials advocated discussing US-Japan issues from a diplomatic perspective, and it was rumored that Prince Chichibu was a suitable person to participate in the aforementioned meeting.

<p>(Berlin) The meeting between German Chancellor Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has become the focus of world attention today. However, whether it can become a reality is still undecided. However, the Berlin Daily News quoted a Geneva dispatch as saying that the important issues for the meeting between the heads of Germany and Italy are the Austrian situation and Germany's return to the League of Nations. According to the newspaper's reporter, if the two leaders can reach a complete understanding on the Austrian issue in the future, Mr. Mussolini will work hard to mediate the disarmament issue so that Germany can return to Geneva to participate in the Disarmament Conference. Therefore, the Austrian issue and the disarmament issue have become connected issues. According to the reporter, Mr. Mussolini's policy of mediation in the future will still be based on the Italian plan announced on January 4, that is, the countries with the most complete armaments should be restricted, and Germany's national defense equipment should be allowed to increase. In addition, ordinary newspapers believe that the meeting between the leaders of Germany and Italy is a matter that every German is happy to hear, because Mr. Xi's visit to Italy is actually "an effort to break the isolated situation." Although Germany's isolation is not Germany's fault, if there is a way to turn the tide and achieve the same result, why wouldn't Germany be happy to do so?

The meeting between the two countries has attracted the attention of European countries. On Monday evening, Jevtic visited External Secretary-General Leger after a brief conversation with Bartou. Well-informed sources believe that the content of the meeting between the two foreign ministers will probably not go beyond Yugoslavia's recognition of Soviet Russia and Bulgaria's accession to the Balkan Pact.

<p>People Doubt the Government's Ability</p>
<p>Although the Vienna authorities have taken all possible precautions, news of atrocities continues to arrive from various places today. Last night, when the Ostend Express arrived at the Westbahnhof, someone threw a bomb, injuring four people. When a patriotic parade was held in Vienna, a bomb exploded. A bombing also occurred in Salzburg, destroying an electrical tower. Sections of the railway tracks in Bludenz were dismantled in two places, but they were immediately repaired. A large number of hand grenade bombs and explosives were found in a cabin in a Vienna park today. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Today, people in Vienna, due to disappointment, doubt whether the government has the ability to restore order, because the attitude of some auxiliary troops is very suspicious. It is not known how the government will use the assistance of the new volunteer army to stabilize its position. The government is currently finding it difficult to cope with the atrocities. Many bombing cases occur every day. If the death penalty is used to deal with troublemakers, only a few radicals will be intimidated, while extremist parties such as the National Socialists or Socialists will be provoked to resist the government with all their might.

<p>In Austria, riots are occurring frequently throughout the country, putting Prime Minister Dollfuss in a difficult and helpless position. Today's cabinet meeting discussed how to ensure railway safety. It is said that the government intends to use diplomatic methods to resolve the issue, but its true intentions are still unclear. Official circles are clearly blaming the various riots on members of the National Socialist Party, but so far, no discoveries have confirmed this claim. In the past forty-eight hours, thousands of members of the National Socialist Party have been arrested, and sixty-eight officials have been suspended for sympathizing with National Socialism. Today, the official announcement places the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party in the same category of suspicion, so it is not entirely impossible for Marxists to brew various riots.

<p>(London) Italy's attitude towards the ban on arms shipments to Paraguay and Bolivia is causing anxiety to those in Britain who are associated with the League of Nations. Italy has put forward two conditions: (1) that both Japan and Russia agree to the embargo, and (2) that all arms ordered by Bolivia and Paraguay from Italy, both for immediate and future delivery, should not be subject to the ban. If these two conditions can be met, Italy will agree to accept the embargo. Regarding the first condition, although Russia has joined, Japan seems to have refused. Association with the League of Nations and, in practice, the participation of Japan and Russia is an indispensable condition for the arms embargo, because neither country has ever shipped arms to Bolivia and Paraguay. As for the second condition, the stipulation regarding future deliveries is sufficient to make the embargo impossible to implement. Italy's raising of this condition is tantamount to refusing to participate in the embargo. People here generally hope that, since all countries have unanimously agreed, Italy will change its mind and no longer insist on its conditions. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e37">US Congress Passes Silver Bill, Three Important Amendments Rejected, Mineral and Industrial Uses Exempt from Profit Tax <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The Senate passed the Silver Bill this morning by a vote of fifty-four to twenty-five. Three amendments were rejected, but a minor amendment was passed, stipulating that silver mines or industrial uses of silver are exempt from the 50% profit tax, while the original proposal for collecting a speculative profit tax on silver remains. An amendment proposed by senators to set the gold-silver ratio at sixteen or seventeen to one, and to freely coin silver, was rejected by a vote of fifty-nine to eighteen. Government-affiliated senators also rejected Thomas' amendment, which argued for setting the standard for currency reserves at 75% gold and 25% silver based on the market price of silver rather than its monetary value, by a vote of sixty-five to seventeen. After passing the Silver Bill, the Senate sent it to a joint committee to resolve differences with the House regarding the profit tax. There was a brief debate before the bill was passed. Senator Borah called for a thorough reform of the national monetary system to prevent wealth from being concentrated in the hands of a few. Borah considered the gold standard and the World War to be the causes of today's global depression and strongly supported the Silver Bill, recognizing the current Silver Bill as a legitimate step, but not recognizing that it has solved the fundamental problems of the monetary system. Borah further advocated immediately minting silver coins with the aim of world trade. Senator King also delivered a speech defending the Silver Bill, saying that President Roosevelt will conclude silver agreements with various countries to raise and stabilize prices and believing that this plan will definitely benefit the world. Senator Hatfield opposed the Silver Bill, calling it a superfluous burden and saying that there is no need to expand currency reserves, with gold reserves exceeding the existing currency reserve by five times. The Silver Bill passed by both houses of Congress stipulates that increasing the gold-silver reserve ratio is the policy of the United States, its ultimate goal being to create and maintain a silver base of one-fourth of the total reserves. It also stipulates that the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase silver at home and abroad with US legal tender or funds not otherwise appropriated, and that the Secretary of the Treasury has the authority to handle delivery and prices, etc., as he deems beneficial to the United States. However, the bill also restricts the power of the Secretary of the Treasury, stipulating that the Secretary of the Treasury has no right to purchase silver under the following circumstances: (1) when the market price of silver is higher than the monetary value of silver; (2) when silver stocks are equal to or exceed 25% of the total gold and silver stocks; (3) when the price of silver exceeds 50 cents per ounce. The Silver Bill stipulates that silver shall be nationalized, allowing this provision to be permissive rather than mandatory. The provision stipulates that when the President deems it necessary to control the price of US currency, he may issue an order to hand over privately owned silver to the mint to mint silver coins or as a currency fund. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Following the House of Representatives, the Senate today passed the Silver Bill. This bill was proposed by silver advocates who wanted to establish measures to support silver during this congressional session. This bill stipulates increasing US silver reserves, allowing the President to accept domestic monetary silver reserves, and allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase silver on domestic and foreign markets at prices, times, and methods that he deems most beneficial to the public interest. For domestic purchases, the price of silver held as of May 1 is limited to 50 cents per ounce. It also allows the Secretary of the Treasury to sell silver when the price of silver exceeds its monetary value, or when monetary silver exceeds the gold-silver ratio of four to one, and allows the Secretary of the Treasury to issue silver certificates, the face value of which shall not be lower than the cost of the silver purchased. This bill also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to manage investigations and prohibits the purchase, import, and transfer of silver, violators of which may be subject to a fine of $10,000 or imprisonment for up to ten years. The Secretary of the Treasury may also issue regulations that he deems necessary to implement this bill. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated today that the New York Federal Assay Office has now received 5 million ounces of silver shipped from London.

<p>(Washington) Belgium and the Czech Republic have notified the United States that they will refuse to pay war debts, and the French Cabinet has also formally decided to notify the US government that it will suspend payment of debt installments due on Friday.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has stipulated five standards for handling local budgets and has notified the provincial and municipal governments to comply with them: (1) Reorganizing local finances should primarily focus on living within one's means.

If the provincial treasury has surplus funds, it should be reported to the central government for approval to be stored for the province's local construction. The county budget will be approved by the province, and if there is a shortfall, the provincial treasury will find ways to subsidize it.

<p>The European political situation, with no results from the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations lacking vitality, shows an increasingly obvious antagonism between Germany and France, leading to an increasingly tense situation. The German people are quite convinced that Germans cannot stand naked against armed enemies, so they withdrew from the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations to show their determination. As for the domestic situation in Germany, when Hitler first came to power in January last year, the number of unemployed workers accounted for almost one-third of all workers, with a real number of over six million. By the end of last year, there were only four million. In January and February of this year, the numbers should have increased due to seasonal factors, but in fact, January had 3.774 million, February had 3.374 million, March decreased to 2.8 million, and at the end of April it decreased by another 191,000 to 2.609 million. Compared to last year, there is a clear improvement.</p>
<p>However, these figures only include those with unemployment insurance or receiving other relief. In addition, there are at least 1.5 million unregistered unemployed people. When asked about the reasons for the improvement, officials say it is due to reducing working hours, emergency civil engineering projects, and abolishing female workers, leading them back to the kitchen, etc. While these measures have had some effect, in reality, the main reason should be the expansion of the military budget and the booming of the military industry.</p>
<p>(1) The budget under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Defense for the fiscal year 1934 totals 890 million marks, of which the army accounts for 654 million marks, the navy accounts for 236 million marks, and the air force has an additional 210 million marks. The subsidies for the Stormtroopers and voluntary labor amount to 250 million marks. All of these can be regarded as national defense expenditures, totaling 1.35 billion marks.</p>
<p>(2) The Ministry of National Defense is responsible for guiding the industrial mobilization of all of Germany, building new factories, and repairing old machinery. Wartime industrial activities have already resumed. This is evidenced by the fact that all military industrial stocks on the Berlin Stock Market rose sharply at the end of last year. Furthermore, in German foreign trade statistics, the import of raw materials for the military industry has increased dramatically, while the export of manufactured goods has suddenly decreased. Industries such as Rheinmetall Krupp, Moersel Berlin, Galsel leaves, etc., as well as military supply factories such as Zeiss, Siemens, etc., the poison gas factory of the Egger dye factory, and engine manufacturers such as Bayern, have all greatly increased their number of workers.</p>
<p>In this situation, after the exhaustion of Germany after the war, restricted by the Treaty of Versailles and burdened by financial and economic difficulties, it is difficult to form a strong army. However, she still does not flinch, striving forward for progress.</p>
<p>The German army is allowed only 100,000 men under the Treaty of Versailles, but these 100,000 men are all excellent cadre officers, and the number of people voluntarily enlisting is about ten times the quota, so the value of the army is very high. Although this military organization is new, it is completely inherited from the tradition of the old army. Its unity is centered on President Hindenburg. Although not many swear loyalty to the old German Emperor, the feudal atmosphere is very strong. Anyone with connections to the Communist Party is very difficult to be selected.</p>
<p>Germany has always had deep hostility towards France and Poland, so it was very close to the Soviet Union. Recently, German-Soviet relations have deteriorated, but she is still greatly influenced by the Red Army. For example, in the organization of equipment, in tactical thinking, and in education and training, these factors still remain. The Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense is similar in nature to the General Staff Headquarters before the war, and its powers are also similar, and it uses this to train the officers it needs.</p>
<p>The number of the army has not changed much in terms of organization, but the equipment has been strengthened. The number of personnel has also increased from 100,000 to 165,000. There are also 100,000 trained reservists and 150,000 police who can be used as auxiliary troops. The SA SS Stormtroopers belonging to the Nazi Party are entirely military organizations, and some are even armed. The number of people who have been trained is over one million. The navy has her pocket battleship, and the air force is also preparing five bomber squadrons and ten to twelve fighter squadrons. In short, Germany is actively engaged in military construction. France, witnessing its military expansion, will naturally accelerate the completion of its air force expansion plan to guard against German retaliation. Therefore, the situation between the two countries has become tense again. (May 1st, Berlin)</p>

<p>Ya'an Dispatch: Huang Musong, the special envoy dispatched by the central government to Tibet to pay respects to the Dalai Lama, arrived in Kangding from Ya'an together with Tang Ying, the commander of the Xikang Reclamation, Yu Ruhai, the special envoy for Kang-Tibetan peace, and others. The Sichuan-Xikang Border Defense Headquarters received a telegram from Kangding stating that Huang, Tang, and others had safely arrived in Kangding. Various agencies in Kangding and Han and Yi people held grand welcome ceremonies. As for Huang's mission to Tibet this time, it is because the Kang-Tibetan dispute has not been resolved for a long time. The central government is paying attention to the western border defense, so it specifically ordered Huang to take the route through Sichuan and Kang to investigate the truth of the Kang-Tibetan dispute in order to resolve it as the opportunity arises. Therefore, Liu Wenhui, the commander of the Sichuan-Xikang Border Defense Headquarters, specifically convened Xiang Yuren, Tang Ying, Yu Ruhai, Liu Yuanzhang, and others when Huang arrived in Ya'an to discuss specific methods for resolving the Kang-Tibetan dispute, to offer to Huang, and specifically appointed Yu Ruhai as the special envoy for Kang-Tibetan peace, intending for Huang to mediate between them so that both sides would return to good terms and end the dispute forever. It is heard that Liu's opinion on resolving the Kang-Tibetan dispute is to take the clear demarcation of the Kang-Tibetan border as a prerequisite. However, the question of where the Kang-Tibetan border should be is quite complex, with much controversy and no agreement. Liu Wenhui's opinion is that the Kang-Tibetan border must be drawn to Chamdo at a minimum. If this issue can be resolved appropriately, other issues such as the restoration of the Da Jin Temple and the placement of the Da Jin surname can be easily resolved. It is heard that Huang also quite agrees with his statement. However, the ideal border in the Tibetan imagination is vastly different from this. The Qionglai Mountains and the Luding Iron Bridge, which were proposed in the past, need not be mentioned. Even the Taining Temple, which was proposed in recent years, and the "Han army must withdraw to Rongba Cha" proposed by Qiong Rang's representative Xiang Jiang Yuwen at the Ada Conference a month ago, differ so greatly that they cannot be measured by distance. It is feared that even with Huang's mediation, it will be difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>According to the Kangbei front-line report on the recent situation of the Tibetan side received by the Sichuan-Xikang Military Headquarters, Tibet is currently divided into three major factions: one is the county government faction, to which Reting Hutuktu and the Kashag belong, with the Dalai Lama's followers as its backbone, advocating the continued maintenance of the current regime; one is the old faction, also known as the pro-China faction, advocating welcoming the Panchen Lama back to Tibet to preside over political power; one is the youth faction, most of whom are students who have studied in England, so they have the name of the pro-British faction, advocating the creation of an independent status for Tibet. The representatives of the Tibetan army stationed on the Kang border mostly belong to this faction.</p>
<p>When Huang Musong set off from Ya'an to Kang a few days ago, he telegraphed the current authorities in Tibet, stating that to solve the Tibetan problem, one must start from religion and then promote politics from religion. Except for national defense, diplomacy, and major international negotiations, which are directly handled by the central government, all other matters are handled by the Tibetan government itself. As for the development of Tibet and education and transportation in Tibet, the central government will provide financial and human assistance and welcome Tibetan youth to study in the mainland to bridge the feelings between the Han and Tibetan nationalities. As for the subsidies that the three major monasteries in Lhasa received during the Qing Dynasty, they will all be restored uniformly and allocated by the central government. It is heard that the Tibetan government is extremely gratified by Huang's entry into Kang and has sent senior officials to Chamdo to greet him.</p>
<h3 id="e82">On the West Bank of the Gan River, Bandits Are Defeated One After Another; Gao Yongsheng Is Captured Alive; Xu Yangang's Troops Are Scattered; Many of Xiao Ke's Bandits Are Killed <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The bandits to the west of the Gan River, as far as southern Hubei and eastern Hunan, are divided into two puppet military regions: (1) the puppet Gan-E-Xiang Military Region, whose puppet commander was originally Kong Hechong, who also served as the commander-in-chief of the puppet Sixth Army Corps, under whose jurisdiction were the bandit troops of the puppet Sixteenth Division Gao Yongsheng and the Independent 123rd Division Ye Jinbo, etc., based in the contiguous mountainous areas of Xiutong in western Jiangxi north of Pingxiang, Pingliu in eastern Hunan, and Chongtong Yangxin in southern Hubei, and with its vicinity as a guerrilla zone, the Nanxun and E-Xiang railways being their only target for sabotage; (2) the puppet Gan-Xiang Military Region, whose commander was originally Li Tianzhu, who also served as the commander of the puppet Eighth Army. Li's bandits have recently disappeared and are being presided over by Xiao Ke. Under his jurisdiction are the puppet Seventeenth and Eighteenth Divisions and the puppet Gan-Xiang Independent Division, using the dangerous mountainous area of Huaxi, contiguous to Yongxin, Anfu, Lianhua, and Suichuan, as a nest, appearing and disappearing in Sui, Wan, Tai, Anji, Lianning, Yong, and Cha-You, and constantly trying to cross the Gan River to respond to the bandits on the east bank of the Gan River. The above two groups are solely tasked with disrupting the rear and containing the national army's suppression efforts. Although no counties within the defense area of the Western Route Army's jurisdiction, which includes forty-three counties, have been captured by bandits, scattered bandits in the four countryside areas of the above counties are still constantly roaming and harassing. The 123rd Detachment and other detachments are also constantly pursuing and intercepting them.</p>
<p>Gao Yongsheng had previously invaded Gao'an Dongxin and Nanxun Road Ma Jiongling to loot, and then led the remnants to escape into the mountains of Xiushui. According to political news, Commissioner Cao of the Third Administrative District Commissioner's Office received a telephone call from Xiushui County stating that the ninth squadron of the county had advanced to Zhongfeng on the ninth and captured a puppet Sixteenth Division Commander Gao Yongsheng. After receiving the telephone call, Commissioner Cao immediately sent Deputy Regiment Commander Wu with a company of soldiers to Xiushui to escort the bandit to the province for investigation.</p>
<p>Xu Yangang, the puppet commander who recently raided Anyi County, withdrew from the county on the 2nd and fled north. On the 4th, he was intercepted by Yue Sen's division at Tan Shen Temple and split into two. Important documents, telephones, mimeographs, etc. of the puppet command of Xu's bandits were captured by the division. Xu himself escaped and fled into the mountains of Tailangling. He is currently being searched for. Yue Sen has telegraphed the province to report, stating, "Xu's bandits fled north. It is judged that they must pass through Tanxi. When Li's regiment of this division took a shortcut from Jiaoyuan overnight to Tan Shen Hall, they happened to encounter the bandits crossing here and were attacked by our vanguard troops, cutting the bandits into two sections. According to captured bandits, 'Only the vanguard battalion passed through, and Xu was behind.' A part will encircle north, and a large part will encircle south. After about two hours of battle, all the bandits were defeated, and countless were injured and killed. The remnants fled in a disorderly manner to Taiziling and Snake Pit Ridge. They are currently being searched for in separate ways. This battle was a surprise attack on the puppet command, capturing various plans, charts, official document boxes, telephones, and 92 rifles, 2 pistols, 5 mules and horses, and capturing more than 20 bandit officers and soldiers, rescuing more than 40 hostages. All the belongings and luggage of the puppet unit were abandoned and exhausted, and they were very embarrassed."</p>
<p>Xiao Ke's puppet Seventeenth and Eighteenth Divisions on the west bank of the Gan River repeatedly attacked Wan'an Taihe unsuccessfully and retreated into the dangerous mountainous area of Macen Donghua Mountain. On the 3rd, the Western Route Army Peng Weiren's division advanced to suppress them and defeated the puppet Seventeenth and Eighteenth Divisions, killing thousands of bandits. They are still advancing towards Macen. Liu Jianxu has telegraphed Jiang to report victory, stating, "Commander Peng's troops advanced towards the bandits in the Chazishan, Macen, and Donghua Mountain areas on Jiang Day. At dawn on Jiang Day, our vanguard attacked along Chazishan. The bandits resisted stubbornly. Our army attacked fiercely and defeated the bandits. Jiang Chen occupied the bandits' strong positions on several lines of Chazishan Macen. When attacking the highlands near Macen East, Xiao's bandits led the puppet Seventeenth and Eighteenth Divisions to launch a fierce counterattack. The battle was extremely fierce. Thanks to our officers and soldiers, who were extremely brave, and after three hours of fierce fighting, they finally defeated the bandits. In this battle, nearly a thousand bandit officers and soldiers were wounded and killed, and many were captured. Our army suffered minor casualties." (June 10)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Guangzhou Ferry Steamer Boiler Explosion Tragedy: Thirty-three Bodies Recovered; Ship Loss of Over Ten Thousand Yuan <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Xinzhao Township, Panyu County, Guangdong Province, is the seat of the county government, located near Huangpu. The Pearl River runs through it, making waterway transportation convenient. The Panyu County Government moved to the area two years ago, making Xinzhao Market the key political and commercial area of the county. Traffic to and from Guangzhou is frequent, so there are as many as four ferries operating between Xinzhao and Guangzhou, making over ten trips a day. Among them, the Yi Shun ferry is owned by Liang Guangji Shipping Company. The volume of the ferry is larger than other ships, and it carries more cargo and passengers. As usual, it departs from the old Haizhu Park front dock on Changdi, Guangzhou, at 8:00 AM every day to Xinzhao Market. The ferry hires the Yu Li small steamer to tow it. All has been peaceful. On the morning of the 6th of this month, the ferry was carrying about 200 passengers returning home from the province. It departed at 8:30 AM. As a rule, when ferries are in the provincial river, small steamers must not use cables to tow the ferry. They must be close to each other. Those heading east must be inspected by the Dongguan Customs before using long cables to separate the steamers and ferries to be towed one after the other. When the Yi Shun and Yu Li steamers were opened together, just as they reached the Nan Di river surface, the water boiler of the Yu Li steamer suddenly exploded due to excessive steam pressure, causing a terrible tragedy to occur suddenly. The explosive force was even greater than a 50-pound bomb. At that time, the Yu Li steamer had been blown into pieces and went with the turbulent flow. Eight or nine people on board, including shipmates Liang Bingyao, Tan Jinwu, and shipowner Liu Chengtang, were all dismembered by the blasted iron branches and none survived. At the same time, the Yi Shun ferry, which was close to the left, was also blown into two pieces. More than a hundred passengers on board fell to the east and west. Some were killed on the spot, some escaped into the water, and some drowned due to injuries. The cries shook the sky and it was too terrible to hear. Fortunately, the ship had not yet left the urban area and the accident occurred on the Nan Di river surface, so in an instant, the Jinghua fire ship, the Civil Ship Association, the water police lifeboat, and the Sea Scout lifeboat all rushed to rescue one after another. The Fangbian Hospital on land, the Fire Brigade Headquarters, the Charitable Fire Brigade, the Police Hospital, the Zhongda Hospital, the Guanghua Hospital, and the Qianghua Ambulance Team also gathered at Nan Di for support. When the Jinghua fire ship approached the disaster ship, it first rescued more than 20 injured passengers waiting for rescue. Later, because the disaster ship was blocking the center of the river, it was inconvenient to rescue, so the sunken Yi Shun ferry was towed to the ordnance factory dock on Nan Di to facilitate work. First, hospital ambulances took the rescued injured to the Zhongda Hospital, Guanghua Hospital, and Fangbian Hospital for treatment. The fire brigade continued to salvage corpses, opening up the sunken cabin, counting more than 20 male and female corpses, transporting them to the Fangbian Hospital, taking photos and numbering them, waiting for relatives to identify them. Four more were fished out on the 7th. The ship carried about 100 passengers and about 200 shipmates. In addition to rescuing more than 60 injured people, a total of 33 corpses were recovered. The rest are said to have drowned and buried in the bellies of fish. As of the next day (the 7th), the remains of 15 of the victims had been identified and claimed by their families, and 18 more were awaiting identification and claiming. It is said that there were two cases in which entire families died, which is also tragic. As for the unclaimed corpses, the corpses had rotted and were temporarily buried by the Fangbian Hospital in the Yiba Sha Yidi in the suburbs for the purpose of later relatives’ claiming. As for the injured, there were more than ten people being treated in Zhongda, Guanghua, and Fangbian hospitals, and eleven severely injured were sent to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. Among them, one named Zhong Jingqing died of his injuries that night. The rest of the slightly injured have been discharged from the hospital one after another. The Fangbian Hospital and various fire brigades have continued to salvage corpses for several days, and it is thought that there may be more salvage. This tragedy not only took the lives of innocent refugees, but also caused the shipping company to lose over 100,000 yuan due to the destruction and sinking of the steamer and ferry. (7th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Canal Dredging Plan: Establishment of a Canal Management Committee with a Budget of 9 Million Yuan <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: China's entire canal system, from Beitongzhou in Hebei Province in the north, passing through Nantongzhou in Jiangsu Province in the east, across the river to Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province, is divided into four sections: the North Canal, the Central Canal, the Inner Canal, and the South Canal. Recently, due to years of neglect, the entire canal system has become severely silted up. In years of heavy rainfall, it causes widespread flooding, damaging farmland along both banks. Furthermore, shipping traffic is frequently blocked. Currently, nine organizations, including the Huai River Conservancy Commission, the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission, the Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Commission, the North China Water Conservancy Commission, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, and the Construction Departments of Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang, and Hebei provinces, have formed a Canal Management Committee to dredge the entire canal system. The work will be carried out in two phases.</p>
<p>For the surveying work, a surveying team will be formed to conduct preliminary surveys. Mr. Wang Huzhen and Mr. Li Ganfu have been specially appointed as the Chief Engineers of the committee. Mr. Wang previously served as the Chief Engineer of the Huai River Conservancy and the Director of the Anhui-Huai River Engineering Bureau. Surveying has already commenced, starting from Beitongzhou in Hebei Province and extending to the Shandong border. It is expected to be completed by the end of this month. Chief Engineer Wang has been dispatched for several days to survey the Central Canal in Jiangsu Province, and is expected to arrive at Qingjiangpu around mid-July to commence surveying southward along the canal.</p>
<p>Regarding the construction of embankments and dredging of the river, the existing embankments along the north and south banks of the canal are in disrepair and prone to collapse. During heavy rains, there is a risk of breaches and overflows. Therefore, embankment construction is essential for dredging. It is proposed to adopt a similar method as the Six-Tang River dredging project, where the governments of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces will instruct the county governments along the canal to be responsible for requisitioning labor for dredging. Each county will establish a work section office, and each province will establish an engineering sub-office. The general engineering office for the entire canal dredging project will be located in Nanjing. The total project cost is estimated at 9 million yuan, to be borne by the governments of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces, as well as the National Economic Council. The four provincial governments will contribute half of the amount, and the remaining half will be borne by the National Economic Council. Construction will officially commence upon the collection of funds. (12th)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Recent Implementation of Land Administration Work in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Promulgation of Provisional Simplified Rules for Sub-Household Surveying</p>
<p>Zhenjiang News: The Jiangsu Provincial Land Bureau has recently been making every effort to advance various land administration tasks. The implementation status of its main tasks is summarized as follows:</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>(1) Land Registration Consolidation: The main task of land registration consolidation is land survey. Jiangsu Province has been preparing for land consolidation since 1927, and it has been over six years. However, no county has fully completed household land surveys (only two districts each in Zhenjiang and Qingpu, and one district in Danyang have been completed, and no entire district has been completed in other counties). The slowness of the original land survey work can be imagined, and the urgent need to improve the original land survey methods is self-evident. In March of this year, the Provincial Government received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requiring the completion of the preliminary work of the land survey by the end of March 1935. The Provincial Land Bureau immediately complied with the order and made some improvements to the original land survey methods, which were deliberated, approved, and promulgated by the Provincial Government meeting, and reported to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Subsequently, the bureau formulated implementation measures based on the plan and ordered the land survey teams in various counties to start implementing them from May 1. In the past month, the staff of each team has been working diligently, and the work is progressing smoothly. If the work is carried out at the current rate, in accordance with the prescribed steps, and in an orderly manner, the preliminary work of the land survey in the province can be completed within one year, and the entire land consolidation work can be completed within three years. Once completed as soon as possible, all land disputes can be eliminated accordingly. Recently, local figures from Fengxian and other counties had some misunderstandings about the clauses of the land survey plan promulgated by the Provincial Government, which led to suspicions and requests to the bureau to maintain the original land survey methods. The bureau responded with explanations and dispatched personnel to the counties to convene the submitters together with the county magistrate to explain in detail, and they have been able to fully understand. The local people's deep concern for land survey work shows that land consolidation is urgently needed. It is heard that the bureau believes that land survey work is originally a local undertaking and should be assisted by local people. Therefore, the opinions contributed by local people will be adopted as much as possible within the scope that does not hinder the work, in order to maximize the benefits of implementation. If the land consolidation work in the counties can be assisted by local people at any time in the future, the progress of the work will be smoother. The Provisional Simplified Rules for Sub-Household Surveying promulgated by the bureau are recorded as follows: Article 1: These rules are formulated in accordance with the Jiangsu Provincial Land Survey Standard for Various Business Work and the item of the achievements that each person should have every day. Article 2: The purpose of sub-household surveying is to determine the shape and area of each piece of land (a 1/10,000 land shape map is made from the results of sub-household surveying). Article 3: Sub-household surveying uses a tacheometer, and is carried out using methods such as the optical method, the semi-conductor method, and the intersection method. Article 4: The scale of sub-household surveying shall be in accordance with the following provisions: 1. Ordinary farmland shall use a scale of 1/2000. 2. Urban land or areas with particularly high land prices shall use a scale of 1/1000 or 1/500. 3. Mountainous areas, tidal flats, wasteland, and other areas with low land prices may use a scale of 1/4000 to 1/10,000 as appropriate. Article 5: The map frame of the original map for sub-household surveying shall be rectangular, 40 cm "long" from north to south and 50 cm "wide" from east to west. When a piece of land is cut off by the map frame line, its entire part shall be surveyed and drawn outside the map frame line of the original map that can contain most of it. If a piece of land is too large to be surveyed and drawn in its entirety on any original map, it may be cut off according to the map frame line. Article 6: Sub-household surveying shall be carried out by township (or district). After a township (or district) is surveyed, map assembly, inking, and land number coding procedures shall be carried out in accordance with the map making rules, and a transparent paper shall be used to copy and transcribe the map. Article 7: The production of the original map and the transcribed map shall be detailed separately in the Provisional Rules for Map Making. Article 8: Land number coding shall be carried out by township (or district), and each township (or district) shall be the starting and ending point. It shall be coded with Arabic numerals in a reverse arc, positive arc, or upward arc coding method. The reverse arc, positive arc, and upward arc coding styles are attached below. Article 9: During sub-household surveying, the land use of the first piece of land shall be checked on site and filled in the center of each piece's shape. Article 10: The land uses are defined as follows: 1. Residential land, including residential houses, shops, factories, ancestral halls, temples, churches, schools, government offices, military camps, and undeveloped land in urban areas, as well as ponds, drying grounds, and gardens attached to residential land. 2. Agricultural land, including paddy fields, dry fields, orchards, mulberry fields, medicinal herb land, farms, nurseries, and bamboo land less than 10 mu. 3. Forest land, including bamboo forests and forests of 10 mu or more. 4. Mining land, including mines, mineral springs, salt fields, salt lands, etc. 5. Miscellaneous land, including fish ponds, water chestnut ponds, lotus ponds, water ponds, firewood hills, grass hills, stone hills, reed fields, grasslands, beaches, sandbars, shellfish farms, pastures, docks, loading and unloading yards, private dikes, private ditches, parks, playgrounds, pastures, forts, etc. Roads, rivers, embankments, city walls, railways, etc., shall be coded separately. Article 11: For the sake of accuracy and speed in sub-household surveying, the owners should be notified to participate in the work at any time. Article 12: Roads wider than one meter shall be surveyed. Article 13: Lakes, rivers, ditches, etc., shall be surveyed according to their shapes. Article 14: Bridges shall be surveyed. Article 15: The boundaries of counties, districts, townships (or districts) shall be surveyed and drawn clearly. If the boundary is a river, the opposite bank line shall also be surveyed. If it is a road or piece of land, the shape outside the boundary shall also be slightly surveyed. Article 16: For land that has been determined to be roads, ditches, embankments, or railway lines, and the construction project has started, or the construction project has not started, but the competent authority has erected a stake and submitted an actual survey map, the measurement shall be carried out according to the new land use. Article 17: If the ownership of the cliffs, banks, ridges, etc. of a piece of land is unclear, it shall be handled in accordance with the following provisions: 1. If it is between two lands of different heights, it shall belong to the higher land. 2. If it is between two lands of the same height, the center shall be the boundary. 3. It shall belong to the customary ownership. Article 18: If the upper layer of land is an embankment or road, and the lower layer of land is another type of land use, the foot of the cliff shall belong to the upper layer of land, but if there are special circumstances, or the slope of the foot of the cliff is very slow, and the boundary with the lower layer of land is unclear, it shall be measured and planned according to the shovel digging location and other areas deemed appropriate. Article 19: If the lower layer of land is a river, ditch, or road, and the upper layer of land is another type of land use, the foot of the cliff shall belong to the upper layer of land, but this shall not apply if it is deemed to belong to the lower layer of land according to the actual situation. Article 20: For adjacent residential houses of the same owner, only if they are separated by walls or other buildings, or the remaining land outside the house is small, they may be measured together. Article 21: Matters not specified in these rules may be handled with reference to the provisions of the Jiangsu Provincial Land Bureau's Implementation Rules for Land Survey Business in the Whole Province, which were promulgated in 1921. Article 22: These rules may be amended at any time if there are any omissions. Article 23: These rules shall be promulgated and implemented by the Jiangsu Provincial Land Bureau and reported to the Provincial Government for record.</p>
<p>(2) Valuation of Land: Valuation of land is an essential part of land administration and the foundation for construction. Dr. Sun Yat-sen specifically listed "land valuation" in the Law on the Implementation of Local Self-Government, and Article 10 of the Program for National Reconstruction also stipulates that "when each county begins self-government, it must first stipulate the price of privately owned land, and the method shall be reported by the land owner himself." Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also emphasized the urgency of levying urban land value tax to equalize the burden on the people in his address to the administrative chiefs of ten provinces in Nanchang. Therefore, land valuation is indeed one of the most important policies at present. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has promulgated the Jiangsu Provincial Urban Land Value Declaration Method, and has designated Wuxi and Nantong, two industrial and commercial cities, as the areas for initial implementation, in order to develop municipal construction and prosper industrial and commercial cities. It is heard that the land value declaration work in the two counties has been scheduled by the Provincial Government to be implemented from July 1, and the Provincial Land Bureau is actively engaged in all preparations, and the work is extremely tense.

<h3 id="e86">Songjiang: Water Police Arrest Suspects in Robbery of Ship <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Dashan area of Fengjing is located at the intersection of Songjiang, Qingpu, and Jiashan counties, and is an area where bandits often appear. On the 25th of last month, a Shenhu bus ship was passing through the area when it was suddenly ordered to stop by bandits lying in ambush. The ship attempted to speed away to avoid danger, but was forced to stop by the bandits firing guns. The bandits disembarked and looted freely, carrying away stolen goods and disappearing ashore with loud shouts. The case was jointly investigated by the water and land police, but no clues have been found so far. Now it is learned that Hu Tu, the third squad leader of the first team of the Provincial Public Security Force on the water, arrested a Chen Dongmou, a suspect related to the case, in Fengjing yesterday. He was escorted to Songjiang and transferred to the district headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Jiading: Five Houses Robbed in Huangdu <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>On the night of the 5th, more than 20 bandits with Jiangbei accents, carrying handguns, robbed five houses in Henghe Village, Yinxing Township, north of Huangdu Town, including Henghe Elementary School and the homes of Zhu and Feng, losing about 500 yuan. The town's defense regiment arrived after hearing the alarm, but the bandits had already fled far away. After receiving the report, the county government dispatched Hu Diguang, the police captain, with a police platoon to investigate and found a suspect named Xiong, who claimed to have been guarding the road at Anting Station.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Changshu: County Anti-Smoking Association Established <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The County Anti-Smoking Association was prepared by the county, and in addition to the county magistrate and the director of public security as ex officio members, Qu Liangshi, Shi Minyong, and Gu Buzhai were also hired as members. It was officially established on the 11th and held its first meeting, during which Gu Buzhai was elected as the secretary. Chen Junmou was appointed as the director of general affairs, Shen Qianji as the director of investigation, Shi Jingzhi as the director of licensing, and Cao Zongyuan as the director of auditing. The staff of all departments will be hired and submitted to the province for approval. The Ye family's house on Taho Street has been rented as an office. Due to the long distance, the registration of addicts in the countryside is inconvenient. It is now planned to ask the province for instructions.</p>

<p>Yu Xu, a woman from Dongshizhuang in the third district, married Zong A-Si from the same village. After the marriage, their relationship was harmonious. However, on the 9th of this month, the couple suddenly quarreled and started fighting. Yu returned to her parents' home to complain to her mother, and her brother Yu Shunmou went to negotiate with A-Si. During the argument, A-Si suddenly kicked Shunmou, hitting a vital point, and he died immediately. The public security branch was immediately notified and reported to the county government. The county sent Huang Cheng, an examiner, to the village on the 10th to investigate, and it was confirmed that he had been beaten to death before his death. However, the murderer Zong A-Si is on the run, and only his uncle, Zong Futang, was arrested and sent to the county for investigation.</p>

<p>This year's spring silkworm market has ended, and the rural economy has improved slightly. However, bandits are taking advantage of this opportunity to rob and pillage, doing everything they can. The news is as follows: (1) On the evening of the 10th, Shen Rujin, the tomb keeper of the Hua family tomb in Dize Township near Dangkou, Nanyan City in the eleventh district, who had some savings, was robbed by seven or eight bandits who broke open the gate, entered the house to rob, and tied up the five members of the Shen family with ropes, threatening and beating them, resulting in a loss of more than 100 yuan. (2) The home of Shen Li, a widow in Xixiang, Fangqiao Town in the fourteenth district, was also robbed the night before, and Shen was burned on both breasts with candles and injured her thigh for half an hour. The loss of quilts and other items was not significant. (3) On the 10th, Ding Hongliang, a villager in Dingxiang, Panpo Township in the third district, had completed a wedding and was full of congratulatory guests, which was quite lively. Unexpectedly, more than 10 bandits came, each holding weapons such as handguns and iron rulers, intending to rob. The villagers there rang the gong to gather the crowd and bravely arrested them. The bandits knew that the situation was bad and turned and fled.</p>

<p>— Qian Jiaju</p>
<p>Why can Yulin homespun cloth exist? This is worth studying. In Guilin, it relies on the Hunan people's spirit of hard work, but here it relies on the clever exploitation of merchant capital. Most of the weavers here are locals, but Yulin (and the Pingnan area) has a special yarn distribution system and a yarn-for-cloth system. There are about 30 homespun cloth shops in Yulin. Some of them distribute yarn to weavers, and some exchange yarn for cloth. Those who distribute yarn to weavers usually put the yarn on the loom head in advance. Each loom head uses one strand of yarn, which can weave two bolts of cloth 3.7 feet long and 1.7 feet wide. They pay wages of 180 or 300 copper coins. Three hundred copper coins are equivalent to about 1.45 yuan in local silver. But how many days does it take to weave 10 bolts of cloth? The most diligent person takes 12 days, and a slow person takes half a month. Earning 1.45 yuan in half a month is really not enough to maintain the minimum standard of living. Another system is to exchange yarn for cloth, usually at a flat rate. The best is to exchange two pounds of cloth for one jin and two liang of yarn. No wages are paid. Why are some weavers willing to do flat exchange (i.e., two pounds of cloth for two pounds of yarn)? Because the cloth is usually starched to make it stiff. Usually, every jin of cloth has three or four liang of rice paste. Therefore, although it is said to be a flat exchange, there are three or four liang of rice paste in one jin of cloth, while two jin of yarn is unstarched yarn. The weavers rely on earning a few liang of yarn in this rice paste. This is the only price of their labor. But rice paste also costs money, so the yarn-for-cloth system is even more miserable than the yarn distribution system. At the same time, the yarn shops are very picky about the cloth they weave. If the size or weight is slightly different, they refuse to accept it under various excuses. The weavers have to endure all the harsh conditions with tears in their eyes. We ourselves have witnessed this situation more than once. This cruel sweatshop system can only exist in China, where the feudal economy dominates. This is really more terrible than the exploitation of workers by British factory owners described by Marx in the first volume of Capital. But Yulin yarn merchants should get a lot of profit through such exploitation. In fact, according to our calculations, it is also extremely pitiful. The selling price of Yulin homespun cloth, which is 15 yards long and 1.7 feet wide, is 2.23 yuan per bolt. The cost of weaving one bolt of cloth requires about four and two-thirds of the 20-count yarn. The local market price of 20-count yarn is 288 yuan per package, and the price of each strand is 3.6 cents. Plus the grinding labor, yarn pulling labor, pigments, paper materials, etc., each bolt costs about 50 cents, totaling more than 2.1 yuan. Therefore, each bolt of cloth earns at most one or two dimes. This again proves that after capitalist commodities invade the poor countryside of China, even if the indigenous family industry of China does not fall into complete bankruptcy, it can only live out its remnant life in such a miserable environment.</p>
<p>Xinding Village in Yulin (about 10 miles from the city) is one of the central areas of the weaving industry. There is a Mr. Li Zenong here, who is worth special mention. This Mr. Li (the villagers call him Teacher Li Shisi) has never been to school, and has never studied mechanical engineering, but he has accumulated more than 20 years of experience and has automatically invented a loom that can weave 16 to 24 candlewick strips at the same time. According to him, if it is enlarged, it can weave three bolts of cloth at the same time. This machine is made of wood, mixed with simple mechanical principles. While weaving the belt, it can also spin yarn. One person only needs to step on the bottom with their feet, without the need for hand movements. According to his own account of the process of inventing the machine, he only saw iron-made towel machines being imported into the local area for the first time during the Xuan Tong years. Later, because the towels were not suitable for the times, they were changed to weaving cloth (during the 7th and 8th years of the Republic of China). By the 21st year of the Republic of China, because the sales of cloth were not very good, they were changed to weaving belts. At first, each machine only wove two strips, then increased to four strips, from four strips to eight strips, twelve strips, and even sixteen strips today. In the future, it will not be difficult to change to weaving twenty-four strips. This machine only needs to be powered by feet, so it can be changed to hydraulic power. Unfortunately, there is no such opportunity at present. But Mr. Li is unwilling to pass on this machine to others, and also prohibits everyone in his family from visiting it. He is afraid that others will learn it, which will cause him to lose this patent opportunity (now he uses this machine he invented to weave belts, and he can earn six yuan every three days). We only took a look at it because we were introduced by a friend. In fact, the structure of the loom is also very simple, but it is a composite of three simple operating machines. We say that unfortunately, Mr. Li was born in 20th century China. If he was born in 18th century England, the status of James Hargreaves or the barber Richard Arkwright would not have been created in this way? However, he is also fortunate to be born in the remote Guangxi. If it were in Shanghai or Tianjin, where the machine industry is developed, this simple machine would definitely not allow him to have a net income of two yuan per day.</p>
<p>Yulin's wharf is the hub connecting Guangdong and Beihai, and it is also a place where salt and rice gather. The rice from Yulin is transported to Guangdong via the wharf, and the salt from Qinlian, Guangdong enters Guangxi via the wharf. This is also the most active place for merchant capital. In particular, the rice from several counties under Yulin gathers here. The wharf has more than ten grain and rice storage shops (there were more than 30 in the 14th and 15th years of the Republic of China). The one that collects the most rice collects and stores 2 million catties every year, and the one that collects the least also collects hundreds of thousands of catties. The peak period for buying rice is around October of the lunar calendar, which is the time when the late rice is harvested. The price of each dan of rice is about five yuan, but it rises to ten yuan per dan in April of the following year, which is the time when the old and new crops are not connected. Therefore, there is a saying in Yulin, "Poor people sell cheap rice and eat expensive rice." Of course, this is not only the case in Yulin, we are just giving an example.</p>
<p>Fumian Village, 30 miles away from Yulin, is another famous homespun cloth area in Yulin. It is not known for sure why it is named "Fumian," but the elders there can all say that it grew a lot of cotton around the end of the Guangxu reign. It is said that at that time, Guangdong people bought cotton in Beiliu and made it into cotton strips that were a foot long and as thick as fingers, and sold the cotton strips to farmers to spin into fine yarn. At that time, Guangxi people used this indigenous yarn to weave homespun cloth, but since the import of foreign yarn, no one has bought the cotton here again, and the number of people growing cotton has also decreased day by day. The name "Fumian" is not true. In the past, a lot of peanuts were also grown here, but since the import of kerosene, the raw oil made from peanuts has no sales, so the production of peanuts has also decreased (now they have changed to growing fluffy peanuts, which are small and fat, and are not the same as before). From these two facts, the impact of cheap capitalist commodities on the Chinese countryside can be imagined.</p>
<p>After leaving Yulin, we set off for Guixian. Guixian is located in the middle reaches of the West River, and is the only way to transport by water and land to Wuzhou. In addition to the fast轮 passing through here, there are also many tugboats sailing between Guixian and Wuzhou. This kind of tugboat has a large area, shallow draft, and is built in the same way as civilian ships. As long as a small gasoline boat is used to tow it in front, it can travel at the same speed as a steamship. This is a powerful tool for freight transport in Guangxi Province. Therefore, Guixian is a very important transshipment wharf in the shipping industry. Goods from neighboring counties are concentrated here and transported to Wuzhou. Goods from Wuzhou are also distributed inland through Guixian. At the same time, Guixian is also a very famous area for sugar production, and a lot of livestock are also transported out. Due to these reasons, the finance of Guixian is particularly active, and it has also become a county with a surplus of exports, which can be said to be rare in Guangxi. We only stayed in Guixian for one night, and set off for Binyang the next day.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Executive Yuan Approves and Promulgates Fundamental Measures to Save the Silk Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang: Detailed Steps for Mulberry Planting, Seed Breeding, Cocoon Drying, and Silk Reeling; Improving Trade and Establishing Credit, Production, and Marketing Cooperatives <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The fundamental measures to save the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which were drafted by the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance, have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The full text was officially promulgated by the Ministry of Industry yesterday. The content includes extremely detailed instructions on the guidance of mulberry trees by technical personnel, the technical improvement of silkworms and the ban on the use of poor seeds, the improvement of silk management and the formulation of silk industry regulations, as well as the investigation of the amount of silk needed abroad, the establishment of cooperatives, and the training of technical personnel. The following is the full text recorded by the New Voice News Agency reporter stationed in Beijing.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Encouraging Mulberry Planting <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>(I) Mulberry Trees (A) Encouraging the Planting of Mulberry Trees in New Areas: The provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are both suitable for sericulture. Areas where silkworm rearing is underdeveloped should be urgently encouraged to plant mulberry trees, so as to directly increase the production of mulberry leaves and indirectly promote the increase of silk production. As for ways to encourage, in addition to the central government formulating incentive regulations, the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces should currently provide excellent mulberry seedlings to farmers free of charge or at low prices, or include a certain amount of silk industry incentive funds in the annual provincial budget to subsidize this expense. At the same time, the cultivation of seedlings should also be encouraged, so that the source of mulberry seedlings is abundant. (B) Guiding Farmers to Improve Mulberry Orchards: Improving mulberry orchards is the fundamental key to managing the silk industry. Measures such as replanting abandoned mulberry orchards, popularizing superior varieties, establishing dedicated mulberry orchards, establishing young silkworm mulberry orchards, improving cultivation methods, improving fertilizers, and preventing and controlling diseases and pests should be implemented by the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, who should dispatch their affiliated sericulture technicians to provide on-site guidance. In addition, the promotion of silkworm rearing with self-produced mulberry leaves and the ban on bad habits in mulberry leaf trading should also be earnestly implemented to thoroughly rationalize mulberry orchard management.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Guiding Silkworm Rearing <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>(II) Silkworms (A) Prohibiting Farmers from Using Inferior Silkworm Eggs: At present, farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces still use homemade local silkworm eggs for silkworm rearing. These local eggs are of mixed quality and carry many viruses. The inferiority of these eggs is a major obstacle to the progress of the entire silk industry. For thorough improvement, the construction departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces should supervise and order all counties to prohibit farmers from purchasing and rearing local eggs. They should be instructed to purchase improved varieties or be provided with them free of charge by the government. At the same time, those who produce local eggs should be gradually guided and taught new methods to match the techniques of improved egg production farms. Furthermore, improved egg-producing merchants should not be allowed to take advantage of the situation, arbitrarily raising egg prices to seek profit. This method should be overseen by the silk industry regulatory offices of the two provinces. The implementation steps should be carried out by year and by region, so that the quantity of improved eggs will not run short in practice. B. Hoping that Farmers Will Improve Silkworm Rearing Techniques: Although Jiangsu and Zhejiang are developed sericultural areas, farmers' silkworm rearing techniques still adhere to old methods and are stagnant. Even with excellent silkworm eggs, the results still end in failure. Therefore, methods such as disinfection, hatching, feeding, and mounting should be earnestly guided by the construction departments of the two provinces by region to improve silkworm rearing techniques and achieve the effect of upgrading raw silk quality. C. Promoting Autumn Silkworm Rearing: The construction departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces should supervise and urge construction sections of all counties to earnestly encourage farmers to rear autumn silkworms in order to utilize equipment, balance labor, promote the rural economy, and increase silk production.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Improving Silkworm Eggs <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>(III) Silkworm Eggs A. Unifying Silkworm Breeds: To improve the quality of raw silk, it is necessary to improve and sort the raw material cocoons. The root of improving and sorting raw material cocoons lies in unifying silkworm breeds. Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces should designate several breeds with superior performance from the currently used spring and autumn breeds for rearing, so that silk cocoons can be unified. At the same time, efforts should be made to test and verify them in order to discover more appropriate silkworm breeds for adoption. B. Rewarding High-Performing Egg Farms and Shutting Down Unreasonable Egg Farms: For egg farms with complete equipment, exquisite technology, and excellent products, the construction departments of the two provinces should allocate a portion of the silk industry incentive funds to subsidize them. Egg farms with simple equipment and crude manufacturing should be strictly shut down in accordance with regulations in order to promote the development of the silkworm egg industry.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Using Cocoon Drying Machines <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>(IV) Cocoons (A) Cocoon Trading: The principle should be direct trade between farmers and silk mills. In the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai areas, the cocoons used by silk mills often cannot be purchased directly from farmers and are often bought and sold by cocoon merchants in the middle, causing the silk cocoons to increase in price. From now on, the construction departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces should formulate and announce cocoon collection methods. Anyone wishing to collect cocoons must comply with these methods. (B) Encourage the Adoption of New-Style Cocoon Drying Machines and Ban Newly Established Old-Style Soil Stove Cocoon Drying: Old-style soil stove cocoon drying often deteriorates good cocoons, increasing the silk reel breakage and degrading the quality. From now on, the use of new-style cocoon drying machines should be encouraged, and old-style soil stoves should be banned. The methods are as follows: (1) Farmers who use cooperative methods to install new-style cocoon drying machines will be granted a considerable incentive by the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces (the amount to be determined by the two provinces themselves), or the construction departments of the two provinces will guarantee to borrow up to half of the equipment costs from the bank; (2) If silk merchants want to install or improve new-style cocoon drying machines, they can also apply to the provincial construction department for a guarantee to borrow a certain amount of equipment costs from the bank; (3) During the cocoon collection season, technical personnel from the construction department will go to various places to guide new-style mechanical cocoon drying technology; (4) Newly established cocoon collection and drying institutions that still use old-style soil stoves should be strictly banned.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Improving Silk Reeling <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>(V) Silk: The reasons for the losses of silk mills in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai areas are partly due to temporary fluctuations in the silk market exchange rate, but poor internal management, inadequate management, and outdated machinery are indeed fundamental and important reasons. The improvement methods are described below: (A) Formulate Regulations on the Silk Industry: The central government should formulate and promulgate regulations on the silk industry to ban inferior silk mills; (B) Guide Silk Mills to Improve Management Methods: Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces should send personnel to various factories from time to time to guide manufacturers in the rational operation of raw material purchases, raw silk sales, and other aspects; (C) Encourage the Adoption of Appropriate Machinery that Can Improve Quality and Reduce Costs: For silk manufacturers who want to adopt new-style appropriate cocoon cooking, silk reeling, inspection, and other machinery, the government should provide incentives. The method is for silk manufacturers to apply to the provincial construction department for a guarantee to borrow up to one-third of the equipment costs from the bank; (D) Guide Silk Mills to Improve Silk Making Technology: The construction departments of the two provinces should send technical personnel to guide various factories from time to time to carry out rational mechanical cocoon cooking, fixed denier or single cocoon, variable silk reeling, silk winding, and rational operation of silk adding, and other technologies that should be improved, such as silk graduallly slowed down, silk reeling end counts are increased. Other techniques that should be improved, such as finishing and inspection, should also be guided in order to manufacture excellent products that meet standards; (E) Guide Silk Mills to Implement Rational Management: The construction departments of the two provinces should send technical personnel to guide various factories from time to time to carry out rational supervision of work, attention to employee hygiene, and fair treatment, so as to encourage all personnel in the factory to work together wholeheartedly and to promote the prosperity of the enterprise and share benefits between labor and capital.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Raw Silk Trade <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>(VI) Raw Silk Trade: (A) Implement Direct Export Through Official-Merchant Cooperation and Overseas Promotion: The Chinese silk trade has always been in the hands of foreign merchants. Even Chinese merchants who are engaged in it have weak capital and no means of promotion. Except for Tongyun, the rest have successively announced their closure. From now on, the central government and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces should cooperate with silk manufacturers and the financial community to organize a Chinese silk promotion company (the head office should be located in Shanghai, and sales offices should be established in New York, Lyon, London, and India) to directly export and sell Chinese silk and to investigate overseas demand and market price fluctuations, report to domestic silk manufacturers, and promote the advantages of Chinese silk overseas; (B) Implement Raw Silk Inspection and Graded Sales: Chinese silk has never been graded, and overseas purchasers often suffer from a lack of uniform standards. From now on, the silk produced by each factory should be sent to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau for strict inspection and grading. Raw silk should be sold on the spot or in futures according to its inspection grade, eliminating the past practice of relying solely on futures sales.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Organize Cooperatives <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>(VII) Sericulture Cooperatives: (A) Guide People to Organize Credit Cooperatives: From mulberry planting and silkworm rearing to raw silk trading, the sericulture industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang feels the difficulty of financial circulation, especially in rural areas. From now on, the governments of the two provinces should send personnel to supervise and order their subordinates to guide people to organize various credit cooperatives in order to promote financial circulation, or organize various credit cooperatives such as mulberry planting and silkworm rearing based on business scope, or organize sericulture credit cooperatives in a certain province, county, or area based on region. These cooperatives can apply to the provincial construction department for a guarantee to borrow low-interest long-term loans from the bank; (B) Guide People to Organize Production, Sales, and Transportation Cooperatives: Production, sales, and transportation cooperatives and credit cooperatives are equally important measures for improving the silk industry at present. From now on, the construction departments of the two provinces should supervise and instruct all counties to guide people to organize various production, sales, and transportation cooperatives, or organize production cooperatives such as silkworm rearing, refrigeration, and cocoon drying, and cocoon and silk purchasing, transportation and sales cooperatives based on business scope, or organize production, sales, and transportation cooperatives in a certain province, county, or area based on region.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Experiment and Research <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>(VIII) Experiment and Research on Various Issues in the Silk Industry: There are many aspects that need to be experimented and researched. Based on the current equipment situation of various institutions, a division of labor and cooperation method should be adopted. Various experiments and research on silkworm, mulberry, and egg varieties should be undertaken by the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, the United Sericulture Improvement Association, the Jiangsu Sericulture Experiment Station, the Yangzhou Original Silkworm Egg Production Station, and the Zhejiang Agricultural Improvement General Station Sericulture Station. Various experiments and research on cocoons and silk should be undertaken by the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, the Zhejiang Agricultural Improvement General Station, and the Hangzhou Silk Factory.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Cultivate Talent <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>(IX) The Cultivation and Improvement of Sericulture Technical Talent: The above-mentioned fundamental improvement work requires various technical talents for its practical implementation, and there must be farmers with sericulture technology to drive it. Therefore, the cultivation and improvement of sericulture technical talent is indeed an urgent matter at present. The methods are as follows: A. The Central Government Establishes an Advanced Sericulture Technical Personnel Training Institute: The central government selects an appropriate location to establish an advanced specialized technical personnel training institute, divided into sericulture and silk making departments, to train advanced technical talents. B. Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Establish Farmers' Sericulture Training Institutes: The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces each establish a mobile sericulture training institute to teach farmers the necessary knowledge and experience in mulberry planting, silkworm rearing, and egg production. C. Establish a Sericulture Research Association: The central government hires sericulture experts from various places to undertake various research work on silk. When necessary, the central government may convene experts to discuss it. D. Hold Sericulture Training Courses: Sericulture institutions of the central government and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces hold sericulture training courses in various places from time to time to teach farmers simple and necessary sericulture knowledge and experience.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Reduce and Exempt Taxes <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>(X) Propose to Reduce or Exempt Taxes and Freight on Cocoons and Silk to Promote the Development of the Silk Industry: A. Propose that the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces issue orders to their subordinates to appropriately reduce various local silk taxes. B. Propose that the Railway and Communications Departments find ways to appropriately reduce freight rates for mulberry seedlings and silk cocoons. (XI) Control of the Silk Industry: When the central government and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces deem it necessary to control various undertakings such as mulberry, silkworm, egg, and silk production, they may implement various controls.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Chen Gongbo Decides to Go to Beijing Tonight <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Contact Made with Leaders in Shanghai's Industrial and Commercial Sectors</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, returned to the country on the 11th after an inspection in Southeast Asia. He originally planned to return to Beijing on the 12th, but it is learned that Mr. Chen still needs to make contact with leaders in Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors, so he decided to postpone his return to Beijing until the evening of the 13th, taking the night train to report to the central government on the results of his inspection. In addition, according to He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, who told reporters yesterday that my country's emerging industries can be promoted to Southeast Asia to seek development. However, sales in that region use a commission system, and domestic manufacturers often lack capital and cannot make large-scale sales. The government should strengthen promotion and guidance. After Minister Chen returned to the country, he was too busy with social events to discuss the matter in detail. However, he has instructed me to be responsible for handling matters related to trade development and will discuss specific measures with various industries and intends to pay attention to emerging industries such as wool textiles and electrical materials. Minister Chen also said that Japanese goods are sold in Southeast Asia entirely because of their low freight rates. Because my country does not have its own shipping company, he contacted the Java Shipping Company and asked them to reduce freight rates, which has been agreed to. He will wait for someone to come to the bureau to discuss the details. In addition, a Westerner named Sprake is willing to promote my country's products in the Southeast Asia region. He came to the bureau to make contact and has been introduced to various manufacturers. Many people have gone to make contact, but it is hoped that Chinese people and manufacturers can automatically go to Southeast Asia to promote sales, so as to avoid the outflow of profits.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Ji Zejin Talks About South Africa Welcoming Chinese Goods <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>However, Development is Still Awaited Due to Inconvenient Transportation</p>
<p>Ji Zejin, Director of the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, said: (1) According to a report from the Consul General in Johannesburg, South Africa is a country rich in minerals and agricultural products. Its exports to China are mainly raw materials, with very few manufactured goods. The bark of wattles and the essence of mimosa grass are both excellent raw materials for making medicines and gunpowder. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, these goods were transported to China, valued at more than £19,400. Chinese black tea, silk, porcelain, carpets, and bronzes are very popular with the people of South Africa, and Chinese merchants have made substantial profits. However, the entry procedures are difficult, there is a lack of managers, and there are few ships traveling between China and South Africa, so trade with South Africa is greatly restricted and should be improved urgently. (2) South Africa has not been established for long, and international trade is still in its infancy. In recent years, due to the surplus of domestic agricultural products, it is eager to open up markets in the Far East to develop foreign trade. It has specially sent Mr. Burns, a commercial commissioner stationed in the UK, to the Far East to exchange opinions with local authorities and enhance business relations. He has also come to China to inspect everything. China and South Africa may be able to use this to improve the business relations between the two countries to develop trade with South Africa.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Jiangsu Farmers Bank Expands Warehouse Storage and Pledges <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Last Year's Warehouses Numbered Ninety-Five, With Storage and Pledges Amounting to One Million Three Hundred Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>This Year It Is Planned to Expand to Two Hundred Warehouses, With Estimated Storage and Pledges of Three Million Yuan</p>
<p>In recent years, the rural economy has been extremely depressed, and all parties have paid attention to the establishment of agricultural warehouses for the storage and pledge of agricultural products. The Jiangsu Farmers Bank has been operating for five years and has always paid close attention to the storage and pledge business, and has made considerable progress. This year's wheat and beans have been harvested, and although it is said that there is hope for a bumper harvest, the price of wheat is expected to fall. At the same time, after the rice harvest, prices will inevitably decline naturally. Therefore, those with outstanding warehouse achievements have specially inquired about the warehouse storage and pledge situation from the bank. The following is recorded for the reference of those who are concerned about the rural economy.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Warehouse Situation <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The bank is the only regulatory agency for the rural economy in Jiangsu Province. Since its establishment, in addition to providing loans to farmers for necessary production funds, it has devoted itself to the operation of agricultural product warehouse storage and pledges, hoping to use this to activate the entire rural finance in Jiangsu Province. Therefore, promoting warehouse storage and pledges is an important policy of the bank. At present, the bank has ninety-five storage and pledge warehouses that it operates itself and entrusts to agents. The bank's branches operate thirty-eight warehouses themselves, and entrust local organizations</p>
<h3 id="e108">Following Zhang Gongquan's Return from Sichuan, Zhang Xiaomei Talks About Her Impressions of the Inspection; Investment by the Bank of China Is Difficult to Determine at This Time <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, Zhang Gongquan, General Manager of the Bank of China, in order to develop the resources of the interior, circulate the rural economy, and develop industry, specially went to Sichuan Province last month with Zhang Xiaomei, Director of the Bank's Economic Research Group, and Shi Jiu'ao, Deputy Manager of the Bank, to conduct on-site inspections and inspect the affairs of the Bank's Sichuan branch. After more than a month, they returned to Shanghai by boat the day before yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from the Dagong News Agency specifically went to the Bank of China to visit, but there were so many visitors that he did not have time to meet him. He specially instructed Secretary Ji of the Bank to tell the reporter that General Manager Zhang intends to draft an article within a day or two to present his findings from this inspection to all sectors. Later, the reporter asked to see Zhang Xiaomei, Director of the Economic Research Group, who accompanied Zhang to Sichuan, and she agreed to meet him. The following is a record of her impressions of the trip to Sichuan.</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Task of the Trip to Sichuan Was to Inspect the Branches <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>According to Zhang Xiaomei, the task of General Manager Zhang and herself on this trip to Sichuan was to inspect the branches in various places, although it was also to inspect the industry in the interior. The Sichuan branch has been established for more than twenty years, and due to various political factors, it has rarely communicated with the head office. At present, the military affairs in Sichuan have come to an end, and the twenty-first year has become a unified situation. Therefore, he made a special trip to Sichuan to inspect the recent situation of the branches in order to make some adjustments.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Backward Production and Import Surplus <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Sichuan Province is known as the Land of Abundance, rich and unparalleled, and can be self-sufficient without relying on foreign goods. The land is fertile and can grow various agricultural products. If the political situation is clear, why would the people not be able to make a living? Unfortunately, in the past, warlords fought for territory, and wars continued for years, resulting in bandits everywhere, rural bankruptcy, and a gradual decline in the goods exported and an increase in the goods imported in recent years due to backward industries. A surplus province has become an import surplus province. When our colleagues arrived in Sichuan, it happened to be the time when the provincial authorities held a production conference to discuss relief measures. However, these relief measures were limited to one corner and could not be planned comprehensively, so the effectiveness was probably minimal. Our colleagues arrived when the conference was about to close, so they were unable to participate, but the military and political authorities of Sichuan Province met with them at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. Liu Fuchen, Chairman of Sichuan Province, is extremely intelligent and capable and works hard on local construction. Unfortunately, he has not taken a step out of the door and has little contact with the outside world. He is inevitably isolated from the trends of the world, and he seems to be slightly unclear about the national situation in China. Mr. Tang Dihai, Director of the Department of Finance, is also very concerned about organizing the finances of Sichuan Province. The reason why it has not been able to unify with the central government is that there are various obstacles in the local system. However, politics is gradually getting on track, and military affairs are gradually becoming unified. This is also a good phenomenon in Sichuan Province.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Heavy Taxes and Chaotic Currency System <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Sichuan Province has the largest number of soldiers among the provinces, so the financial authorities have to increase heavy taxes to cope with this huge military expenditure, which has led to industrialists not being able to bear the burden and closing down one after another, and investors are competing to stop, creating opportunities for the import of foreign goods. For example, the tax on a dozen toothbrushes used to be 3 cents, but now it has increased to 2 dimes, which shows the severity of the taxes. Furthermore, the currency system is chaotic, almost unparalleled. The use of copper coins even changes from place to place, and the suffering of the people is unspeakable. However, the currency system is closely related to the financial community, and the financial community should assist in reforming it to eliminate local malpractices.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Goods Abandoned on the Ground Need to be Exploited <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Sichuan Province has a mild climate and abundant products. The annual production of salt from Zigong, sugarcane from Neijiang, and white wax and silk from Jiading is unlimited. Unfortunately, they adhere to old methods, do not know how to improve, resulting in waste of raw materials and reduced production. The method of making salt in Zigong is to dig a few feet into the soil with artificial labor, take out large bamboo tubes to draw out the salt quality, and do not use sunlight to dry it. Dig deep into the ground again, wait for the gas to gush out and burn it with fire. It relies on the gas to dry it, because the underground there contains extremely rich coal quality. For example, sugarcane in Neijiang is ground into juice with cows and donkeys, and then sugar is fried with firewood. Those who use machines to manufacture are as rare as phoenix feathers. The labor of a whole day and night is still not equal to the power of a machine for twenty minutes, which is a pity. For example, tung oil is also a very large product of Sichuan. In the past, Yichang was the meeting place, and it was operated exclusively by the Zhongyuan Company, which has also declared its failure recently. The coal in Sichuan is also a very large resource. At this moment, no one has exploited it, resulting in goods being abandoned on the ground.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Investment by the Bank of China Is Difficult to Determine at This Time <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>As for the rumors that the purpose of General Manager Zhang's trip to Sichuan was to study the goal of investment, this cannot be discussed at this time. For the sake of its own interests, the Bank of China does not directly operate its investment. It must consider whether the politics of each place is on track and whether the local authorities can cooperate sincerely is the most important key. If politics is not on the right track, if someone sets up a very large factory in the interior and is taxed very heavily, would entrepreneurs dare to invest under such circumstances? Therefore, the Bank of China's investment in Sichuan Province is still difficult to determine.</p>
<h3 id="e115">The Scenery is Beautiful and the Best in the World <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The places that our colleagues visited were first from Shanghai to Hankou, where they stayed briefly to inspect the Hankou branch, then from Hankou to Yichang, from Yichang to Wanxian, and then to Chongqing, Chengdu, Zigong, and Neijiang. Recently, from Neijiang to Jiading was the end point. Because we passed Mount Emei, we visited the scenery and stayed for a few days, and then we went directly east. The impression of this trip is that the scenery in Sichuan is unforgettable for us. The mountains in Sichuan are surrounded by mountains and rivers, and the scenery is the best in the world. Compared with Switzerland in Europe and the West, it is even better. Switzerland has a very narrow width and a small production, but it can use the quiet beauty of the scenery to attract foreign investment and maintain its national expenses. If Sichuan is developed, its politics are stable, its construction is perfect, and its transportation is convenient, all sectors of the country will inevitably rise up and enter Sichuan in the future, and the limits of its development are unlimited.</p>

<p>Ms. Zhang finally told the reporter cautiously that there is also a place in the Three Gorges that is not related to military affairs, politics, and financial conditions, but has a very close relationship with education. It is truly a blessed place in Sichuan, no less than a land of peach blossoms. It is found that the North Fu area of the Three Gorges used to be a bandit area. After Yang Sen's recovery, Mr. Lu Zuofu, General Manager of the Minsheng Shipping Company, exhausted his efforts to operate it. The annual funding required is about 60,000 yuan. If the local production is not enough, Mr. Lu will subsidize it. There is a spirited and well-equipped militia to defend the local area, and there is a perfect educational institution to enlighten the people. The facilities such as instrument halls, libraries, hospitals, research rooms, hygiene halls, schools, factories, as well as improved teahouses, improved theaters, etc., are all available. The cleanliness of the roads and the neatness of the layout are unparalleled in all parts of the country. In the prosperous world of ancient times, those who did not pick up things lost on the road and did not close their doors at night seemed to be like it.</p>
<p>There are thirty-two agencies, and twenty-five are run by cooperatives or farmers' education halls, distributed in more than twenty counties with abundant agricultural products such as Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, Danyang, Jiangyin, Wujiang, Qingpu, Xuzhou, Yancheng, and Rugao, specializing in the storage and pledge of agricultural products near the county to regulate agricultural prices and benefit the turnover of rural finance.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Storage and Pledge Quantity <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The bank has ninety-five storage and pledge warehouses that it operates itself and entrusts to agents. The quantity of various agricultural products stored and pledged this year has reached more than 500,443 dan, and the total value of storage and pledges is more than 1.28 million yuan. At this time when the rural economy is bankrupt and financial turnover is sluggish, this huge amount of funds is distributed in the rural areas of various counties. Although it has not been able to restore and prosper the rural economy in one fell swoop, the financial activities and turnover in rural areas have indeed been far better than in the past.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Statistics by Category <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Our nation is founded on agriculture, and the main agricultural products are rice, grains, beans, wheat, miscellaneous grains, silk, cotton, and bean cakes. Jiangsu Province is located on the coast of the East Sea, with the Yangtze River running through the middle and the Grand Canal flowing vertically from north to south. Its abundance of water conservancy far surpasses that of other provinces, so these kinds of agricultural products are especially rich. However, due to the drastic drop in prices, rural villages are increasingly becoming bankrupt. This bank, regarding the agricultural products of various counties in Jiangsu Province, such as rice, grains, beans, wheat, raw silk, bean cakes, and cotton, has been storing and mortgaging them to the greatest extent possible. According to statistics from the bank's own and entrusted agency warehouses, the agricultural products currently stored and mortgaged are most abundant in rice and grains, followed by beans, wheat, bean cakes, cotton, and raw silk. The quantity stored and mortgaged this year is estimated at approximately 250,000 *shi* of rice and grains, approximately 30,000 *shi* of wheat, approximately 30,000 *shi* of beans, approximately 20,000 *shi* of cotton, approximately 100,000 pieces of bean cakes, approximately 20,000 *shi* of miscellaneous grains, approximately 8,000 *shi* of raw silk, approximately 1,500 *shi* of fertilizer powder, and approximately 30,000 bolts of cloth.</p>

<p>It is heard that in addition to expanding the existing warehouses in various counties, the bank has now decided to continue adding more to strive for promotion. It also plans to handle storage and mortgage matters on behalf of the agricultural warehouse management committees of various counties. It is estimated that within this year, 2 million *dan* of rice and grains will be mortgaged, with 3 million yuan used as storage and mortgage funds. In terms of rescuing the entire rural economy, its effect may not be very significant, but compared to the situation last year, it should be a considerable increase in effect.</p>

<p>According to the Kwomin News Agency, the case of the disappearance of Tskamoto Hideaki, the deputy Japanese consul in Beijing, remains without a clue. The Capital Garrison Headquarters of our side, together with the Police Department, has offered a reward of 10,000 yuan to search for Tskamoto's whereabouts. The spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai expressed his gratitude to visiting reporters yesterday, while maintaining the attitude of the previous day's statement. He also explained the matter of the Japanese warship Tsushima sailing to Beijing yesterday to participate in the search, as follows. The remarks of the spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy to reporters yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Still Not Expressing Opinions <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai told reporters yesterday that the Japanese Embassy is still adhering to the written statement issued the previous day, and will not express any opinions before the truth of the facts is clarified. Therefore, the rumor that a protest will be lodged with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs is known to be inaccurate. As for the speculation that Tskamoto's disappearance was due to abduction and murder, it is the speculation of Japanese residents in Nanjing and has no basis. Therefore, it is not recognized as the official opinion of the Japanese Embassy.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Gratitude for Our Side's Offering of Reward <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Later, the Japanese spokesperson mentioned the joint announcement by the Capital Garrison Headquarters and the Police Department offering a reward of 10,000 yuan to search for Tskamoto. He stated that the Japanese side is quite grateful that our side is willing to make efforts to investigate the whereabouts of the missing person.</p>

<p>At 5:00 AM yesterday, the warship "Tsushima" of the Third Fleet stationed in China was ordered to set sail from Shanghai, following the Japanese warship "Kashiwa" and rushing to Beijing to participate in the search for Tskamoto. According to the Japanese spokesperson, the Tsushima and other ships sailed to Beijing to search for traces of Tskamoto in the Yangtze River near the capital, and there was no intention to send marines to land.</p>

<p>Arino Manabu, the Chinese language advisor of the Japanese Embassy, took the night express train from Shanghai to Beijing the night before last. According to the spokesperson, because there are not many staff members in the Nanjing Consulate General who are proficient in Chinese, there have been more contacts with the Chinese authorities recently regarding the disappearance of Tskamoto. Mr. Arino is very proficient in Chinese, so he was specially sent to Beijing to assist the personnel of the Japanese Consulate in Beijing.</p>

<p>It was also said that in Shanghai, personnel from the Japanese Consulate and the police station had also conducted investigations in various Japanese-owned hotels and other places in various ports, but there were no clues. However, the authorities in the two concessions were not entrusted to investigate.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Thoroughly Investigate the Qingpu Lantern Ban Dispute. Provoked Public Outrage, Created Chaos in the Market. Should Be Strictly Investigated According to Law <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>In Zhujiajiao Town, Qingpu County, the district chief, Wang Rongzhong, for no reason, banned the carrying of lanterns, which provoked public outrage. The district chief still did not repent, but arbitrarily ordered the arrest of good citizens, creating chaos in the market. Fellow villagers of the county in Shanghai, Wu Kaixian and Chen Kecheng, telegraphed the provincial government, requesting a thorough investigation to punish the lawless. The text is as follows: We have learned that in Zhujiajiao Town, in the second district of Qingpu County, the party and government organs of the town, in order to promote the New Life Movement, initially led all sectors to hold a propaganda conference on April 21st and 22nd. Later, the people of all sectors, in order to expand propaganda, held a lantern parade on May 29th, 30th, and 31st, so that the main purpose of the New Life Movement could penetrate the people. Considering that all major cities in the country have similar actions, this move by the town should not be inappropriate. However, when the town held the third day of the lantern parade on the evening of the 31st, the town's district chief, Wang Yingzhong, suddenly telegraphed the first branch of the Public Security Bureau for no reason, dispatched police to stop it, and detained lanterns, intending to forcibly dissolve the parade. The merchants and residents of the town, because the matter was unexpected, were suspicious and outraged, resulting in the unfortunate dispute of destroying the Public Security Bureau branch, the district office, and the private residence of the district chief. All that has happened, please examine it carefully. Kecheng and others are traveling in Shanghai, deeply concerned about their hometown, pitying the people's will being suppressed, justice being difficult to achieve, and especially fearing that it will cause great changes and endanger the local area. What the heart feels is dangerous and difficult to silence, sincerely presented to you. Zhujiajiao connects Zhejiang and Jiangsu, with merchants gathered from all over. It was originally the most important town in Qingpu County. In recent years, the country has been in turmoil, and all industries have declined. Now, the merchants and residents of the town held a lantern festival, in order to promote the New Life Movement, and also to revive the market, and to allow merchants and farmers to relieve their accumulated depression after a year of fatigue. This is both reasonable and appropriate. However, the district chief, Wang Yingzhong, as the district chief, was not aware of the suffering of the people, let alone the proposal for the lantern festival. Moreover, the 29th and 30th had already been approved and held in an orderly manner, so why did he suddenly ban it on the 31st? Even if the district chief had other opinions on the lantern festival, why not stop it beforehand, but wait until two days after it was held before banning it? The reason for this is difficult to understand. District Chief Wang Yingzhong is usually clumsy, which is enough to see one aspect of this. This is one. On the 31st, the district chief temporarily telegraphed the Public Security Bureau to dispatch police to stop the lantern festival, and when the people were agitated and outraged and went to question, he was unable to explain himself and only knew how to threaten with dangerous words, even pulling out a box cannon, intending to fire it. Fortunately, it was seized and no major disaster occurred. District Chief Wang Yingzhong's misconduct is self-evident. This is two. The lantern festival was prepared in advance, costing both time and money. Being banned for no reason on the 31st, it is unavoidable to feel resentment in light of common sense. The people of the town were unable to restrain their feelings, and they were not calm when the incident occurred, thus destroying public property. Considering human feelings and the law, it is also understandable. However, the district chief falsely accused the higher authorities after the incident, arbitrarily framing others, personally leading the police, holding Browning pistols, and indiscriminately arresting good citizens in large numbers, as many as thirty or forty people. He also used private torture and forced confessions, and declared that anyone who participated in the lantern festival would be arrested. How can our villagers bear it? District Chief Wang Yingzhong arbitrarily acted recklessly, exploiting the common people, not only tarnishing the official code, but also violating discipline. This shows that he did not regret the disaster afterwards. This is three. Furthermore, Wang Yingzhong, as the head of the local autonomous region, caused the lantern festival dispute in the district, which is enough to show the lack of training of the people by the district chief. If he cannot govern himself, how can he govern others? Thinking of this, it is painful to speak. It is heard that the arrested people are shackled and imprisoned, treated like thieves, and after being shocked by heavy punishment, some are mentally disturbed or seriously injured. It is also heard that the county government has recently issued arrest warrants, summoning the executive committee members of the chamber of commerce, Long Ji-liang, Jin Hai-dong, Zhang Qiu-chen, etc., causing panic in the whole town and fear among the villagers, who are mostly reluctant to move forward. The market is becoming increasingly depressed, and they are restless all day long. Considering this situation, it is deeply shocking. I believe that the incident in the town was entirely caused by the district chief, Wang Yingzhong, and the arrested people, whether farmers or merchants, are all law-abiding citizens. Although their actions may have been excessive, they were forced by circumstances and provoked by public outrage. Forgive their ignorance, it does not seem appropriate to be harsh. If it is said that there is another background and an attempt to riot, then it is easy to add guilt. As for the executive committee members of the chamber of commerce, they are related to the prosperity and decline of the local area. You are all known to be people of integrity and just gentlemen in the area. Today, this unprovoked summons will inevitably fundamentally shake the entire town's commerce and finance. Unless it is necessary to make the entire town miserable before feeling satisfied, it must be a deliberate attempt to implicate others, which is also inappropriate. I have always admired your compassion for the people's suffering, treating the people as if they were injured. I dare to sincerely request that you examine the facts and instruct the Qingpu County government to handle the case leniently, and promptly order District Chief Wang Yingzhong to be escorted to the province for strict punishment, and select competent personnel to take over, in order to maintain the people's lives and ensure peace. The telegraph is urgent, and I am extremely frightened and await orders.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the town's chamber of commerce telegraphed the provincial government's Chairman Chen and Commissioner Yu the day before yesterday, saying: Zhujiajiao Town in the second district of Qingpu County, since all the organs and organizations were ordered to initiate the New Life Movement lantern parade, the local people, in order to expand the propaganda, continued to carry lanterns and ended the parade on May 29th to 31st, carrying lanterns during the day for three days. Unexpectedly, at 1 pm on the 31st, just as the lanterns were being assembled, District Chief Wang Shi-xiu suddenly telegraphed Jin, a member of the Public Security Bureau, to dispatch police to stop the parade (at that time, the branch chief Yao Yu was on leave due to business), which angered the people. The crowd was so large that the Public Security Bureau branch was destroyed. Then, the police officers of the Public Security Bureau stated that the lantern ban was requested by District Chief Wang Shi-xiu. The crowd swarmed to the district office, the entertainment venue, and Wang Shi-xiu's residence, destroying everything and dispersing in a flurry. This time, violating the New Life Movement and causing a major change, District Chief Wang Shi-xiu is truly to blame. Instead of reflecting on himself, he was stubborn and used money to falsely accuse County Chief Qian, arbitrarily framing others, personally leading the police, and indiscriminately arresting good citizens, such as the executive committee members, Jun Liang and Jin Hai-dong, and member Zhang Qiu-chen, who are all wealthy and law-abiding citizens. Everyone in the area knows this, and they are also falsely accused. In this way, human rights lose their guarantee, and what is the meaning of the rule of law? Moreover, one wave has not subsided, and another wave has risen. Suddenly, on the evening of the 6th of this month, the district chief and all the chiefs and police officers of the Public Security Bureau had a major dispute, which almost caused a catastrophe, causing panic among the people and several shocks in one night. If it is not resolved quickly, the consequences will be dire. In addition to submitting separate reports to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and the Qingpu County Government, we are urgently telegraphing you, requesting you to send a senior official to thoroughly investigate and severely punish the troublemakers, in order to maintain human rights. It would be fortunate for the local area and fortunate for the merchants and people. Gao Huan-chang, Chairman of the Zhujiajiao Town Chamber of Commerce in Qingpu County, bows.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Qian Zongze, director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, came to Shanghai a few days ago to inspect the bureau's Shanghai-based joint transportation office and the business operations of joint transportation with the China Merchants Bureau. He completed his work on the 11th and took the night train to return west to Beijing. According to reporters inquiring from the office, the Lianyun Port wharf, which was opened by the Longhai Railway to develop joint transportation, has been progressing rapidly since construction began, and it is expected to be completed around the end of October this year. Currently, the bureau's joint transportation goods are transported by barge from Sunjiashan to the ship. There are often winds and waves in the port, so transportation is difficult. After the Lianyun Port wharf is completed, joint transportation there will be very convenient.</p>

<p>Following the discussion of proposals, there was only one item, which was a proposal from the Tianjin Shipping Company to initiate the organization of a national federation of shipping associations to facilitate the progress of association affairs. As a result of the discussion, it was felt that the association was currently engaged in effective cooperation matters and had no time for this. It was decided to discuss and proceed after the joint transportation was completed. Therefore, it was passed by a unanimous vote to retain it. As for the cooperation matters, the association had previously sent letters to various member companies, requesting them to submit methods for discussion and progress. Since some member companies had not yet replied, the chairman reported at yesterday's meeting, requesting that they not delay. A meeting will be convened immediately to discuss after all members have sent their opinions to the meeting.</p>

<p>Reporters from the Dagong News Agency learned from relevant sources yesterday that the Central Executive Committee, after receiving a report from the Anglo-American Strike Committee, ordered the city's party and government agencies to mediate quickly.

<p>The Shanghai North Eight Roads Business Association sent a letter to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau yesterday, saying: Respectfully, we have recently learned from members such as the Jitai Shan Rice Shop and the Yongli Southern Goods Store on the Dajing Road and Zhongxing Road that, in recent days, they have repeatedly seen a group of Jianghu evil beggars, coiled around by snakes, or wielding knives and axes, with broken heads and shattered foreheads, forcibly begging from door to door. Pedestrians avoid them from afar. This kind of evil beggar is not only detrimental to public morals but also hinders business. They request that measures be taken to ban them, etc. It is found that the strange shapes and appearances of the evil beggars are indeed detrimental to public morals and hinder business. According to the above-mentioned situation, we hereby send a letter, hoping that your district will order each of the respective sub-bureaus to issue orders for arrest and banishment.

<h3 id="e149">Zhang Jingou Talks – Land Reclamation and Locust Control are More Effective – Practical Politics to Relieve Farmers' Suffering <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>In view of the locust plague, which occurs every year and directly harms the farmers' economy, the Ministry of Industry held a seven-province locust control conference in Beijing. The representative from the Commodity Inspection Bureau of this city was Zhang Jingou, director of the Pest Control Department. The conference closed on the 7th of this month, and Mr. Zhang also returned to Shanghai a few days ago. The reporter specially went to inquire about the proceedings of the conference and what his impressions were. The main points of Mr. Zhang's reply are recorded below: (The following is Mr. Zhang's talk) There were 22 proposals in this conference, which can be summarized into three points: (1) Locust control regulations; (2) Locust collection technology; (3) Locust control funds. Regarding the regulations, the conference has revised and passed them separately and sent them to the Ministry of Industry for reference. Regarding the technology, it can be divided into two types: (1) those that can be promoted now; (2) those that still need to be researched. Regarding the funding, there were many proposals. The conference decided that the more important one was to ask the Ministry of Industry to transfer to the Executive Yuan to send a letter to the National Economic Commission or order the Ministry of Finance to raise funds specifically for the central and provincial locust control funds to solve the Chinese locust problem. The three items of regulations, technology, and funding must be planned and taken care of at the same time. In China's situation, the government should pay attention to a once-and-for-all solution. The so-called once-and-for-all solution is to reclaim all the wasteland where locusts occur. It is best to plant wheat, barley, and sorghum. Otherwise, it should be developed into forests, so that it must not be left barren. For example, in the Rocky Mountains of the United States, locusts and grasshoppers were a huge disaster decades ago, but after this method, they disappeared by themselves. If we wait until after the outbreak before driving them away, it is a bad policy. There are many new methods for locust control now, which can be divided into chemical, physical, and biological categories. Which method should China use after all? It should be adapted to local conditions to be effective. Later, the reporter asked about his impressions of the conference. According to him, recently, the government has been earnestly seeking to relieve the suffering of farmers and the prosperity of the national economy, such as the improvement of silk and tea, etc., which is enough to show a glimpse. Therefore, this trip was very impressive.</p>

<p>The Yang An steamer of the Sanbei Company was towing a barge to transport goods to Hunan. On the way, it collided with a civilian boat, drowning the boatman. The personnel on the steamer were involved in a lawsuit with the boatman's family in the Wuchang court. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e151">Ship Collision at Parrot Island <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Sanbei Yang An steamer, which operates on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, was towing the 13th and 17th iron barges, fully loaded with passengers and cargo, to Changsha for unloading on the 7th of this month. When the ship reached the Parrot Island section of the river upstream of Hankou, a civilian boat towing a large number of bamboo rafts was coming downstream. They encountered each other in the Parrot Island section of the river. Due to the rapid downstream current, the two ships collided when they approached each other. The stern of the civilian boat avoided the collision relatively late and was hit by the Yang An steamer, damaging the stern of the boat, but it did not sink.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Negotiations with the Civilian Boat <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the incident, the circumstances were very minor. If the civilian boat had negotiated peacefully, an accident could have been avoided. Unexpectedly, after the civilian boat was hit, it gathered its fellow boatmen and seriously negotiated with the Yang An steamer. The Yang An steamer did not stop at that time and continued to move forward as usual. When the civilian boat chased after it and prohibited the Yang An from sailing upstream, demanding compensation for the loss, the river water was extremely turbulent. The Yang An steamer was towing a heavy barge, so it ordered the civilian boat to give way so that it could stop and negotiate. Unexpectedly, the civilian boat ignored it and blocked the river surface, causing a second collision when the Yang An stopped. The civilian boat sank immediately, and all the boatmen fell into the river.</p>
<h3 id="e153">One Person Drowned <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Yang An steamer's collision with the civilian boat was due to the civilian boat's failure to heed warnings. In the face of rising tides and rapid currents, it was its own fault. After stopping, it immediately rescued the people who fell into the water. The nearby civilian boats also came to help salvage. Many people were rescued on the spot. According to the owner of the civilian boat, one of the boatmen was said to have not been rescued and had drowned. The body was later salvaged, but it was not found. At this time, the owner of the civilian boat began to negotiate with the Yang An steamer, gathering a large number of barge operators and ordering the Yang An steamer to compensate for all the losses, which led to a major dispute.</p>

<p>The Yang An steamer was trapped by the boatmen of the wrecked civilian boat and could not leave. The dispute continued in the Parrot Island section of the river. The local water police bureau learned about it and sent a group of police officers on a boat to investigate the cause. After inquiring about the case, it was found that each side had its own reasons and it was impossible to judge for the time being. The two boatmen of the Yang An steamer were detained by the water police, along with the owner of the damaged civilian boat, and taken back to Wuchang and sent to the court. The Yang An steamer continued to tow the heavily loaded iron barge upstream to Changsha. The two parties are still detained in the Wuchang court awaiting trial. The Hankou branch has urgently reported to the Shanghai head office and requested instructions.</p>

<p>Zhou E'xuan, the eldest son of Zhou Weishi, the owner of the Zhou Gengji Yarn Shop, a wealthy merchant in Shanghai, was accused of abandoning his biological son, Zhou Dayuan, and failing to provide for his food and clothing. Dayuan's mother, Zhang Zhuying, hired a lawyer to sue E'xuan in the First Special District Court, asking him to be punished for the crime of abandonment. After being summoned by Judge Wu Zehan, Zhou E'xuan was found not guilty. The plaintiff was unwilling to accept the verdict and appealed to the Second Branch Court, requesting a retrial. Yu Hua, the presiding judge of the criminal court in charge of the case, again ordered Zhou, Zhang, and Dayuan to be re-examined by the Zhenru Forensic Institute. Subsequently, Lin Qi, the director of the institute, reported that the blood types of the three people were the same, and Dayuan's appearance was particularly similar to Zhou E'xuan, confirming that they were born to Zhou and Zhang. Last Tuesday, Judge Yu specially convened a collegial panel, summoning a thousand witnesses to investigate. All the witnesses who appeared in court, except Zhou's driver, said that the child was indeed born to Zhou and Zhang while they were living together at No. 8 Xinglongfang, Danshui Road. On that day, the court ordered the debate to end. Yesterday afternoon was the date of the verdict. Zhou E'xuan avoided appearing in court. At 2 p.m., the judge took the stand, and only Zhang Zhuying was present. After the court inquired about her name, age, and origin, the verdict was announced: "The part of the original verdict concerning Zhou E'xuan's innocence is revoked. Zhou E'xuan is sentenced to six months of imprisonment for failing to provide the necessary support for a person without the ability to support himself."</p>

<p>Chen Jing, an inspector of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was suddenly attacked by three gunmen on Guangxi Road at about 9 p.m. on the 9th of this month. At the same time, Chinese policeman No. 558 of the Laozha Gate Police Station, who was on duty at the intersection of Hankou Road, was also seriously injured in the leg. Both of them were injured and collapsed in pools of blood. The perpetrators took the opportunity to escape without a trace. After the Laozha Gate Police Station received the report and dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate, Chen and the Chinese policeman were sent to the hospital for treatment. It has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Chinese policeman's name was Wang Jinrong, 33 years old, from Shandong. He lived at No. 49 Xinzha Road. He had a wife and children at home, who depended on him for a living. Now, he was suddenly attacked by gunmen while on duty. Unexpectedly, his injury suddenly worsened the day before yesterday. He was treated in vain at the Municipal Council Hospital and died at about 10 p.m. The body was taken to the Forensic Institute on Faelun Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Diao Chengtang, forensic doctor Zhang Yan, clerk Wang Zujiong, and others to the institute to investigate the body. After the Western police chief reported the situation at the time, Mr. Diao then announced that the deceased, Wang Jinrong, had indeed been shot in the leg and died. The body was handed over to his wife, Wang Zhu, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial. It is now reported that the police are strictly pursuing the perpetrators.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Snake-Catching Old Beggar – Bitten by a Poisonous Snake – Fainted on the Spot and Became Unconscious – Later Woke Up Blind <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>There is an old beggar in Wusong, whose name is unknown. People call him Big Foot. He is nearly sixty years old. Although he is a beggar, he does not beg from door to door. He specializes in catching poisonous snakes, stripping their gallbladders, and selling them to those who suffer from eye diseases for treatment. Secondly, whenever there is a funeral procession, he acts as a guide and collects road money. Therefore, all the people in Song know Big Foot. As for his surgery of stripping snake gallbladders, it can be called the best. A few days ago, I saw him stripping a snake gallbladder without using knives or scissors, and it was not troublesome. He just stepped on the head and tail of the snake with his two feet, opened it with his two fingers on the abdomen, tore it down, and immediately took out the bloody, green snake gallbladder from the intestines, immediately in his palm. However, the poisonous snake at that time was still alive as before, without any pain of having been taken away from its heart and gallbladder. Later, he used a broken brick to flatten the snake's head before it died. Yesterday, Big Foot went to the countryside to catch snakes again and found a small poisonous snake about a foot long. Because he saw that the snake was small, he did not pretend and grabbed it with his hand. Unexpectedly, the little snake bit his ring finger severely, and the skin on his hand was slightly broken. However, the poison was deep and painful to the heart. Knowing that it was not good, he rushed back to his residence. Although he rushed back, he was exhausted and hoarse, and immediately fell to the ground, unconscious. Later, he was rescued and woke up, but he was blind in both eyes, and his fingers were swollen all the way to his shoulders, as big as a human leg. The speed of the spread of the poison was alarming. Although he knew the treatment method, because he was so severely poisoned, his life was in danger. Knowing that he could not do anything, he immediately ordered someone to go to Shanghai to find someone with the same business in Ningbo (whose poison treatment method is better than Big Foot) to come to Song for treatment. The poison has now subsided slightly, and his life may be saved. According to him, it is because he usually kills too many snakes that he is now receiving retribution. However, now is the Dragon Boat Festival, when all kinds of poisons are released. Those who carry burdens on their shoulders and walk at night should pay close attention to avoid stepping on poisonous objects, which may cause danger.</p>

<p>Wang Rusong, a detective of the French Police Department, Zhang Daorong, a deputy detective, and detectives Wang Dongwan and Guo Shaotang, recently learned that someone was secretly setting up a mechanism to manufacture poisonous red pills in a house at No. 3 Huashengfang, Diandang Street, outside the Old North Gate. To avoid suspicion, they started manufacturing every night when it was quiet and stopped working at dawn. The goods produced were sold as No. 11 (goods name) in this city and the surrounding areas, making a lot of profit. They immediately reported to the Western Police Chief, who went to the address at 4:30 a.m. yesterday without making a sound and searched the premises. The manufacturing mechanism was set up in the pavilion room upstairs. The workers were manufacturing when they were arrested on the spot: Zhou Fuqing (23 years old, from Yangzhou), Ding Wancai (23 years old, from Yangzhou), Chen Chunyin (26 years old, from Jiangbei), Yuan Hongcai (20 years old, from Chongming), and other four people. Forty pounds of finished red pills, fifty pounds of unfinished ingredients, a pill-making board, three ovens, four sieves, a copying pill board, a small bag of coffee sugar, two scales, two cups of fire paint, two bundles of hemp rope, and two large foot basins were seized. It was learned that the leader of the mechanism lived elsewhere. Zhou and other four criminals, along with the evidence, were taken to the police station and sent to the Criminal Court 1 of the Second Special District Court at noon on the same day. Judge Xiong Huiyi took the stand for interrogation. Fei Xizhen, the lawyer representing the police department, stated the case and said that the main culprit in the case had not been caught, and the investigation had not yet begun. He requested a postponement and temporarily detained the defendants to investigate the detailed facts of the case and file a lawsuit, etc., and submitted the evidence to the court. After reviewing the report, the court ordered the police officer in charge to report the details of the arrest and briefly interrogated the defendants. The court then approved the postponement and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody to await further instructions.</p>

<p>Qin Afa, who lived at No. 49, Lane 551, Xinzha Road, was a driver at the Xiang Sheng Motor Company. At 9:30 a.m. on the 21st of last month, Qin returned home from the company and saw his wife, Qin Yu, sleeping in the same bed with the adulterer, Gao Yihe. Enraged, he stabbed Gao to death with a knife and also injured his wife. The police took Qin and the murder weapon to the First Special Court. Qin hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to defend him, and lawyer Zhang Tianyin represented the police and prosecuted him for the crime of injuring a person resulting in death. After repeated interrogations, the sentence was announced. It has been reported in this newspaper several times. Yesterday morning, the sentence was announced. Judge Liu Yugui took the stand in Criminal Court 8 and announced the verdict: "Qin Afa is sentenced to five years of imprisonment for injuring a person resulting in death. The number of days detained before the judgment is final shall be counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days. The murder weapon is confiscated. The attached civil lawsuit in this case is transferred to the civil court of this court for trial."</p>

<p>Chen Hansen, a Fujianese who once served as a Daotai in the late Qing Dynasty, built a Western-style residence at No. 4 Mandelan Road. He employed seven male and female servants in his home. In April of last year, he hired Chen Afu, a Yangzhou native, as a chauffeur, who was guaranteed by Ma Lishi's employment agency. He has been serving for more than a year. On the 26th of last month, Chen entertained guests at home. Chen Afu wanted to go out for entertainment but was stopped by his master, which caused a slight dispute, and Afu was dismissed. On the 9th of this month, Chen Hansen suddenly discovered that 100,590 yuan of military reduction government bonds, which were stored in his iron box, including 100 bonds worth 1,000 yuan each and 590 bonds worth 10 yuan each, had disappeared. Afu's guarantee, which had been submitted earlier, was also missing at the same time. It was found that Chen had invested in buying the government bonds in 1929, and the bonds were stored in the iron box in the upstairs bedroom, along with Afu's guarantee. There were two keys in total, one held by Chen and the other by his wife. A few days ago, Chen's wife returned to Shanghai from her hometown and wanted to withdraw interest from the bank, so she opened the box to check and discovered that the bonds had been stolen. He reported the theft to the Chengdu Road Police Station and asked for an investigation, saying that Afu had gone to his home to ask for the guarantee after being dismissed, and was highly suspected. The police chief sent Chinese detectives Yang Xinzheng and Bao Tingwei to arrest Chen Afu yesterday morning and take him to the police station for detention. This morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court 2 of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu rose and stated the course of events, saying that the police still needed to investigate whether Chen Afu was suspected of stealing the government bonds. Therefore, he requested that Chen be detained for two days for further interrogation. After Chen Susou, Chen Hansen's son, complained about the theft, Chen Afu was questioned and denied the theft. After reviewing the confession, Judge Deng Baosun announced that Chen could be detained for two days for further interrogation.</p>

<p>The Gongji Zhongyu Electric Pole Iron Factory, located at the intersection of Huade Road and Baoding Road, was opened by Wang Jinsheng. Li Cungui and Li Cunfang, both from Anhui, were casual workers in the factory. At noon on the 28th of last month, the two Lis were sent to work in the iron-sheet house at No. 594 Kunming Road, plating electric poles on iron tubes. Unexpectedly, due to a moment of carelessness, the electric tube suddenly exploded, causing Li Cungui to die on the spot. Li Cunfang's left leg was blown off. At that time, Cungui's wife, Li Cai, also known as Genmei, who was only sixteen years old, and Cunfang's younger brother, Li Mohai, who was thirteen years old, were also injured when they went to the place to ask the two Lis to go home for lunch. Mohai was injured in the face, and Cai was injured in the left leg. Afterwards, the injured were sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, and the deceased Li Cungui was sent to the coroner's office. The court has investigated the details. It has been reported in this newspaper. However, after the incident, the families of the dead and injured went to the Zhongxing Electric Pole Factory to negotiate, but the factory owner Wang Jinsheng avoided meeting them and secretly instigated the local hooligan Xiao Wang to come forward to threaten them, intending to muddle through. However, because it was rumored that the factory owner had given Xiao Wang 1,000 yuan, he was not allowed. Li Cunfang, Li Li (Cunfang's wife), Li Mohai, Li Cai, and others hired lawyer Chen Wenxiang to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Wang Jinsheng of the crime of negligent injury under Article 301 of the Criminal Law, and Xiao Wang of the crime of fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Law, requesting that the two defendants be summoned to court for interrogation according to law, and attached a civil lawsuit, requesting compensation of 3,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the hearing in Criminal Court 5. The plaintiffs appeared in court one after another and stated the course of events. The defendant hired lawyer Huang Xiubo to defend him. Judge Huang ruled that the case involved the crime of injury resulting in death under Article 296 of the Criminal Law, which was a local case, and ordered that the case be transferred to the local court for trial.</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau previously believed that various broadcasting stations in the city often broadcast obscene songs, which were harmful to public morals. It sent a letter to the International Telecommunications Bureau requesting them to ban them, and the Education Bureau sent a letter inviting the Municipal Health Bureau, the New Life Movement Promotion Association, and the International Telecommunications Bureau to send representatives to discuss practical measures for banning them. After discussion, it was decided that the International Telecommunications Bureau would send a letter to each broadcasting station, asking them to submit their broadcasting programs to the bureau daily, and the bureau would jointly review them with the Education Bureau.

<h3 id="e163">Communication from the Tongru Chonghai Qi Hometown Association: A Plea Regarding Cai Yangqi's Ordeal of Electric Torture <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Tongru Chonghai Qi Five-County Sojourners' Association in Shanghai, yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Citizens' Federation and major organizations in this port, which read: "Respected Sirs, our fellow townsman, Cai Yangqi, an investigator for the Old Zhabei Police Station, was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment by Lang Zuyin. This case has been reported repeatedly and has been protested by the Chinese Ratepayers' Association. We have learned that Cai Yangqi has lived in Qiyao, Chongming, for generations and is an extremely honest and reliable person. He has been working in the local goods industry in Shanghai for ten years and has never been involved in any illegal activities. Since this case occurred, our association has sent people to investigate and is convinced that he was innocently framed. He was subjected to electric torture seventeen times by police station detectives and had cold water poured into his nose, repeatedly dying and reviving. After the court declared him innocent and released him, he vomited blood uncontrollably and was on the verge of death. He has reached a state where he cannot recover his health. Hearing him recount the details of his torture, even those with hearts of stone could not help but shed tears. This kind of inhumane crime actually occurred in a police station that claims to be civilized, which is truly astonishing. It has come to our attention that Shanghai's investigators (omission) and the Municipal Council has taken no corrective action. Do they regard Shanghai as a savage place, and therefore use this cruel and inhumane illegal behavior as a legitimate way to maintain order and tranquility? If this kind of situation occurred in countries like England and America, how would it be handled? We believe that the police station authorities are supported by the taxpayers and are fully responsible for local security. Achieving the best results by effectively reducing crime is the highest achievement. If, after a crime occurs, the perpetrators are apprehended by legitimate means, it is also welcomed by society. If cruel punishment is occasionally inflicted on extremely violent thieves and kidnappers who are not afraid of the law, although it is not permitted by law, it may be understood by the people as a necessity. However, to subject anyone to severe and cruel torture based solely on the arbitrary actions of investigators, without investigating their usual conduct or considering the evidence, except for those with special influence or a large amount of money, is unacceptable. Under such duress, anything can be obtained. Those who have been wronged have no way to appeal. Only a very small number of cases like Cai Yangqi's are made public. Where is the protection of human rights? Where is the effectiveness of the law? All Shanghai residents are deeply saddened and indignant. Therefore, they regard the Cai Yangqi case as a serious social problem. The police station's use of electric torture is an open secret, and the protection of investigators is dedicated to unconscionable deeds, which is even more offensive to the people. If this is not strictly corrected, how can any resident of Shanghai protect themselves? Since the Chinese Ratepayers' Association protested, the Municipal Council has not taken appropriate measures, and the police station has instead protected investigator Lang Zuyin, who refuses to appear in court. Justice has been extinguished, and indignation is boundless. Our association has repeatedly convened meetings and believes that punishing the investigators who committed the crime is a matter for the court, but preventing similar cases from happening again is the responsibility of society. Your federation is the representative of the people of Shanghai and must work together to protest and urge the Chinese directors and committee members to do their best to assist in upholding justice and human rights. We are extremely grateful and await your instructions." Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Citizens' Federation, Tongru Chonghai Qi Five-County Sojourners' Association. (Guowen News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e166">Special District: Emergency Meeting of Rickshaw Merchants <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Special District Office of the Rickshaw Industry Association, regarding the Municipal Council's recent announcement of the standards for new public rickshaws and the issuance of registration certificates to rickshaw owners, held a special emergency meeting of members yesterday at the Taihe Building Association Hall on Lloyd Road. More than 100 people attended, including Yin Zhiling, Gu Songmao, Bao Zhenhuang, and Zhu Hegao. The meeting was chaired by Liang Ruiting to discuss the Municipal Council's proposed standards for new public rickshaws. It was generally agreed that the standards were purely to cater to the curiosity of the nouveau riche and were not sturdy. Not only would it not improve public rickshaws or provide any benefit, but it would cause immense losses to the merchants. The Municipal Council's resolution on the public rickshaw design was to improve the design, making it sturdy, clean, and lightweight, and not to replace the currently licensed public rickshaws with completely new and different designs. It was resolved to maintain the current public rickshaws, improve their design, and negotiate with the Vehicle Affairs Committee. As for the Municipal Council's notice in the newspaper on the 9th, ordering all rickshaw owners to apply for a license and provide a guarantee to the association before the 14th, or else no license would be issued, it was generally agreed that the guarantee procedure should be presented to the Municipal Council to request an extension. Representatives were elected to meet in person to explain everything. The petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition for an extension to the deadline for applying for a license: We read in the newspaper on June 9th about the Municipal Council's Notice No. 4477, which stated that rickshaw owners should obtain blank application forms for rickshaw owner certificates in writing from the Vehicle Affairs Committee office of the Municipal Council, fill them out according to the instructions, and submit them for review. The deadline is June 14th. If the application is deemed合格, the certificate will be issued, and the issuance date will be set. The certificate will be issued every two days starting from June 18th, with 100 certificates issued each time, until July 21st. After that date, if there is no certificate, the rickshaw will not be licensed. After reading this, we felt that the matter was of great importance. Therefore, on June 11th, we convened an emergency meeting of all members to discuss it. It was generally agreed that there are 10,000 rickshaws in the special district, and about 1,000 people operate them. The Municipal Council's method of only publishing the notice in the newspaper for one day and setting a deadline of only four days is extremely rushed. Rickshaw owners vary in intelligence, some read the newspaper and some do not. It is difficult to inform everyone in a short period of time. Moreover, some have other businesses and reside in other cities, so the news is delayed. It is even more difficult to complete the application and guarantee procedures in a hurry. Furthermore, the Municipal Council previously convened rickshaw owners to register, which took eight months and was repeatedly extended. The announcement has not yet been completed. Now, it is announced in the newspaper for only one day, without prior notice to all parties, ordering all rickshaw owners to apply for a license and provide a guarantee within four days, and to complete everything. Otherwise, no license will be issued, which is deeply shocking. We do not know what the Municipal Council's Vehicle Affairs Committee intends to achieve with this licensing method, and it is difficult to understand. However, rickshaw merchants, in order to maintain their capital and livelihood, cannot accept this method, which disregards the facts and the time. The resolution was passed to submit a petition to the Municipal Council to request an extension in order to avoid any omissions, and to elect representatives to meet in person to explain everything. The case is recorded accordingly, requesting the Municipal Council to review and approve the extension of the deadline for Notice No. 4477, in order to show consideration and facilitate the public. Respectfully submitted to the General Manager of the Municipal Council, Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association Special District Office Standing Directors.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Writes to Public Utilities Bureau Regarding Improvement of Stamping Method on Barges <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, which read: "Respected Sirs, on the 10th of this month, we received a letter from the Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association, stating that after the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau inspects and measures Shanghai's barges, it stamps a hard-printed number on the rudder plate. The position is easy to step on, the lettering is shallow, and after being exposed to rain and sun, it will soon disappear. If the Shipping Office finds out, even if there is a license plate and a license, and proof of monthly payment, the boat owner will be accused of privately transferring the boat or forging the hard print. The boat is impounded and arbitrarily punished, even to the extent of several months of boat tax. Merchants request an investigation, or provide a guarantee, that if a barge with the same number is found, the guarantor will be responsible, but this is ignored. On May 12th, barges No. 12 to 26, No. 12649, No. 12504, and three boats were found by the Zhabei Shipping Office of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to have had their hard prints removed when the rudder plates were repaired. After the boat owners went to explain, No. 12526 was handled according to Article 4, Item 9 of the Shanghai Regulations for the Suppression of Cargo Ships, with a certificate from the shipyard and a guarantee, and was allowed to be reprinted. However, the other two boats were not allowed to be reprinted. This violates the same regulations, so why are the punishments different? This is incomprehensible. Although representatives have repeatedly petitioned the Public Utilities Bureau, the reply is always 'handled according to regulations.' Therefore, the merchant ships are now in a state of being unable to appeal. If this is not quickly improved, the suffering of the merchants will deepen day by day, and they may be forced to suspend operations. The first key point of improvement is to imitate the fire-branded prints used by the Customs and Municipal Council on seagoing ships and small vehicles, so that the lettering is clear and not easily removed, so that merchants are no longer wrongly accused. The second key point is to pay attention to whether the license plate and license of the barges whose hard prints have fallen off are consistent, and to check whether the boat tax paid to the Finance Bureau has been paid in full. In addition, if there is a certificate from the shipyard and a guarantor, they should be allowed to be reprinted immediately, without hindrance. As for the issue of grades, they are now suddenly different from the past. It is said that there are discounts of 20% and 10%, which is like buying and selling goods, allowing them to do whatever they want, which is not something that outsiders can know. Therefore, there is a real need to reform the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau's current method of suppressing cargo ships. Otherwise, it will not be possible to save the merchants from deep water and fire. The request is to have the conference forward a letter to the Public Utilities Bureau to fundamentally reform the management of ships in order to maintain commercial transportation.' We have reviewed Article 4, Item 8 of the Shanghai Provisional Penal Regulations for the Suppression of Cargo Ships, which states that if the steel seal number is blurry and unclear, a fine of 5 cents will be imposed. If the Shipping Office of the Public Utilities Bureau is immediately notified to reprint it, no additional fee will be charged. Furthermore, Item 9 of the same article states that if the original steel seal number position is removed due to repairs and is not reported for reprinting, a fine of 1 yuan will be imposed. Reprints of steel seals, as per Item 2 of the same article, privately transferring boats, is also only a fine of 1 yuan according to regulations. Privately removing the steel seal, according to Article 5, Item 3, is only a fine of 3 yuan. Why should there be so-called detention of boats and punishment, and even fines of several months of boat tax? We request that your bureau investigate this matter thoroughly to avoid excessive implementation. Regarding the two points of improvement requested by the association, the first point is to change the steel seal number to a fire-branded print, which is to make the lettering clearer and not easily removed. This would save your bureau the trouble of reprinting and save the merchants from wrongful fines, which would benefit both parties. If the steel seal is removed due to repairs and there is a certificate from the shipyard or a guarantee from the industry, they should be allowed to be reprinted according to regulations. With this appropriate certification from the authorities, it would not be based solely on one-sided statements, and the merchants would be spared the suspicion of transferring boats and falsifying seals, saving endless trouble. We respectfully request that you investigate and approve the implementation separately to achieve public friendship."</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Association yesterday received a letter from the Preparatory Committee of the National Mining and Geology Joint Exhibition of the Ministry of Industry and Education, stating that the association was originally scheduled to open the exhibition on June 1st and close it on July 10th. Due to the long distances from various provinces, there were concerns that the exhibits would not arrive in time. In order to save expenses, the Ministry of Railways was asked to borrow various steel display cabinets and frames, which was approved. However, the Railway Exhibition will close on June 20th, and the association will open on June 21st. There is very little time to transport the utensils and display items. Therefore, the Standing Committee decided to postpone the opening to July 8th and close on July 28th. It is hoped that all items will be actively sent and quickly transported to Tianjin to allow for a more leisurely arrangement.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Ningkang Lane Tenants Write to Landlord恳求Not to Increase Rent Again <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The houses in Ningkang Lane on North Zhejiang Road in this port, during this period of rent reduction, have been notified by Wu Zhiping, the lawyer representing the landlord, of a 15% rent increase, starting from December 19th. In addition to paying the monthly rent as usual, each household is being asked to pay up to 715 yuan for the amount not previously collected, which is rare for a rent increase. The tenants of the lane sent a letter to the landlord, Li Dafu, begging: "Mr. Dafu, we respectfully address you. Previously, four representatives of the tenants of our lane visited Chongjie and received your generosity. We admire your exceptional magnanimity and virtuous character. The previous misunderstanding was caused by the separation between the two sides. After thinking about it, we feel ashamed. We respectfully present our situation and difficulties to you. Our tenants have been living in your houses for a long time, and it seems inappropriate to be in such an extreme situation. The situation is indeed unfortunate, and we are compelled to do so, not out of resentment. Since the January 28th Incident, all industries have declined, and the issue of rent reduction has become the target of public criticism. Ningkang Lane was the first to bear the brunt of the war and suffered losses that have not yet been fully recovered. Although those who agree will stay, and those who disagree will leave, according to Shanghai custom, housing is a means of earning a living, and there are deposit rentals, transfer fees, and renovation relationships. In fact, there is a difficulty in leaving immediately. You have long understood the underlying meaning, so we know that the right to increase the rent is not ours, but we have repeatedly spoken out, hoping to gain exceptional favor. How can we achieve the true meaning of co-existence and co-prosperity? It is nothing more than mutual understanding, thinking of ourselves and others, and hoping that things will be fair. We were previously shown that seeing each other in court is not our wish. Your compassion is evident. Your innate endowment is unmatched, which is not a result of good deeds in the past? Planting good causes will surely lead to good results. We only ask that you be lenient in this matter, and those who leave will be few. There may be an inconceivable merit in the unseen, which is especially great for those who are engaged in business. The so-called 'obvious departure, secret return' is consistently true. If you insist on the original proposal and resolutely deal with it, watching hundreds of men, women, old and young in danger, people are not wood or stone, who has no heart? Although I do not kill Boren, Boren died because of me. We, the tenants, speculate that you would not bear it. We believe that litigation has no impartiality to speak of. One party wins, and the other party must fight. Even if we abide by your intentions and endure the pain unwillingly, it is difficult to guarantee that there will not be one or two troublemakers who still hold revengeful prejudices. Then one wave will not be settled, and another wave will rise. The lawsuit will continue all year round, to what end? You are wise and will not take this course. The court has now extended the deadline three times and repeatedly asked us to mediate. The case is restricted by law, and the court has long understood the rights and wrongs. The enforcers have repeatedly told your lawyer, Wu Zhiping. Time waits for no one, and the deadline is approaching again. We, the tenants, have been discussing for days, and it is difficult to move forward or retreat. If we obey, we will not be able to support ourselves, and if we refuse, we will not be able to report our lives. The discussions are chaotic and there is no result. Their embarrassment is such that some are in tears. They all say that the only way to save this crisis is to rely on you. Give us a slight adjustment without harming our vitality. If you can untie the knot, who else can we rely on? As long as you give us a little favor, we will feel like we have been reborn. We have no unreasonable demands. We will see your great virtue and benevolence praised throughout the world, and the newspapers will praise your merits. We have expressed our sincere words, and our language is incoherent. We hope you will consider and respond. We wish you well. June 11th."</p>

<p>The Ningbo Sojourners' Association in Shanghai concluded its ninth fundraising member congress on the 9th of this month. In the midst of the current economic downturn, the association's fundraising has exceeded the original target by one-half, which is a testament to the leadership of General Captain Yu Zuoting, General Staff Xu Maotang, Chen Runshui, and the enthusiasm of the team leaders and members. It has been learned that although the association's fundraising congress has concluded, the committee has resolved to set a three-week closing period, that is, until the end of this month. During this closing period, the closing will be handled on the one hand, and fundraising will continue on the other, so that as many Ningbo people in Shanghai as possible will join the association. The funds raised, in addition to using 30,000 yuan for two years of education expenses, will be used to repair the association's expenses.

<p>The Hangzhou Silk Group of the Shanghai Silk Industry Association (i.e., Qianjiang Guild Hall) on Ningbo Road in this port, in view of the lack of public libraries in Shanghai, in order to facilitate the spare time reading of the industry's shop assistants and improve their service efficiency, has established a Hangzhou Silk Industry Library. Preparations have now been completed, and the library will officially open on the evening of the 16th of this month. The hours are from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM every evening, except Mondays. The library is completely service-oriented and does not charge any fees. Reading and borrowing books are limited to shop assistants of the group's members, which is truly good news for those in the industry who love to read.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Guohua Bank Offers Factory Loans <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The Guohua Bank on Beijing Road in this city, in order to assist the development of small industries run by Chinese people, held a factory loan program last month. It is reported that many people in the industrial sector went to apply for loans. Recently, the bank has also provided more convenient assistance to these factories, as factories purchase raw materials in cash, while the payments for the sale of finished products are mostly long-term and cannot be used immediately, which may affect their progress. For factories that sell raw materials to factories, or factories that sell finished products to wholesalers and meet the principles of factory loans, they can negotiate with the bank regarding the long-term payments receivable and use the method of exchanging notes and other procedures to borrow cash. This can be called a warm-hearted service to society and is an innovation in Shanghai's financial circles.</p>

<p>The Chicken and Duck Industry Association held its first member congress yesterday at the Tea Industry Association in the Yantian Wharf on South City. 27 members attended. Representatives from the Municipal Party Department, Fan Guoren, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Li Ruzhang, reported the purpose of the meeting, the progress of work over the past year, and the financial report by the presidium Zhao Songe, Zhang Xilin, Wang Yuezhi. Then, the proposals were discussed. (1) The association's rules have been reviewed and revised by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and 100 copies of the rules have been printed and sent to the bureau for filing. The chairman read this aloud and it was unanimously passed and voted. (2) The discussion of how to collect the membership fees and monthly fees owed by various members was debated for a long time. Later, the representative of the Municipal Party Department put forward three methods: (A) The membership fees and monthly fees owed by each member should be paid in full, and the legal resolution of last year's conference should not be overturned. (B) If any member believes that there are discrepancies in the association's income and expenditure accounts, they may publicly elect several auditors to review the accounts. (C) In the future, if the association's constitution is to be amended regarding membership fees, it must be proposed at today's conference. Subsequently, the members who owed membership fees could not comply with the opinions of the representative of the Municipal Party Department, so the meeting ended without a result. The association has now reported the progress of the meeting to the superior authorities.</p>
<p>The Flower and Tree Industry Association, because the flower shop business has plummeted and is difficult to maintain, and the shops are asking for rent reductions, a meeting of flower shop representatives was specially convened yesterday to establish a rent reduction branch. More than 30 flower shop representatives and 9 executive committee members attended. Huang Yueyuan chaired the meeting and performed the ceremony. First, Hong Songjiong, a member of the committee, reported on the association's participation in the work of the Promotion Association. Next, Mr. Qiu Liangyu, a representative of the Promotion Association, gave guidance on the procedures and implementation methods for requesting rent reduction. Then, the discussion began and the following resolutions were passed: (1) The Flower and Tree Industry Branch of the Rent Reduction Promotion Association will be established immediately, with the original executive committee members serving as members of the Rent Reduction Branch. (2) In accordance with the notice of the Promotion Association, the period from the 11th to the 20th of this month will be the general mobilization date, and the payment of rent will be suspended uniformly. (3) Before the rent reduction is resolved, the rent will be stored in the bank at the original rent amount. (4) The flower shops proposed that flower vendors have recently been blocking customers and hawking flowers in front of the flower shops, which is detrimental to the shop's business. They requested that measures be taken to ban this. It was resolved to send personnel to the market first to use the New Life Movement to persuade flower vendors not to hawk in front of flower shops, but to sell ten storefronts away from flower shops, and not to surround pedestrians on the road and compete to sell, obstructing traffic. The above guidance method will be notified to each flower shop, which will each be guided in front of their stores. The deadline is from the 15th to the 30th. After the deadline, the resolutions will be enforced. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>The Glass Industry Association held its eighth joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees yesterday. Wang Songyuan chaired the meeting and Wu Zhen took the minutes.

(2) It was recommended that Chen Jianlong be a representative to attend the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to convene the fifth member congress and hold the second re-election. (3) The recommendation to identify the First Special District Court for the acceptance of damaged glass cases was pursued by Li Songfang and Chai Wenjing. (4) It was recommended that Chen Jianting and other ten people be representatives to participate in the Shanghai Municipal Government to convene the city-wide representative welcome Panchen Conference. (5) The resolution to delineate the membership business level for payment of membership fees was approved.

<h3 id="e182">Reading Q&amp;A: On Plagiarism 丨 Reply to Mr. Xu Ke 丨 <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The "Free Talk" section of this newspaper once published an article by Maxim Gorky titled "What Books Should Children Read?", which included the following passage:</p>
<p>"Science and inventions should not be written as a ready-made account of discoveries and inventions, but as a battlefield of human struggle against material obstacles and traditional ideas. The compilers of such books should be well-researched scientists, not book-compiling craftsmen who copy from here and there; only through the cooperation of true scientists and talented writers can we engage in publishing books that disseminate scientific knowledge with artistic skill."</p>
<p>After reading this passage, Mr. Xu Ke raised the following two questions for us:</p>
<p>(1) Any discipline must have related subjects. For example, when a physiologist writes about physiology, he inevitably has to refer to anatomy. How can he avoid the suspicion of copying from here and there?</p>
<p>(2) What is the difference between compiling a popular version of a famous work and copying from here and there?</p>
<p>We accept Mr. Xu's questions and offer some correct interpretations of plagiarism, because this is helpful for readers in distinguishing the quality of a book, and even when compiling a work.</p>
<p>Based on the questions raised by Mr. Xu, we feel that Mr. Xu not only does not fully understand Gorky's passage, but also seems to not fully understand the meaning of the word "plagiarism."</p>
<p>Plagiarism refers to an author taking someone else's article and presenting it as his own. Plagiarism is different from citation. Citation is the open use of someone else's words to prove one's own argument, while plagiarism is ambiguous in the author's attitude. He does not indicate the author and source of the original text, and his own writing does not have a fixed point of view, but only uses phrases that others are accustomed to using as embellishment. If a physiologist wants to use anatomy when writing about physiology, then he should not hesitate to indicate the source of the original text, and especially should ensure that the cited sentences are not just filler, but are part of the entire system of his own article, becoming something that complements his own views, or precisely what he wants to write. In this way, it is clearly not plagiarism but citation. All "copycats" can be called "petty thieves." They hold the view that "whatever is in hand is wealth." Randomly stealing may sometimes lead to one or two real treasures, but sometimes they may also "mistake dog poop for treasure." Although they themselves do not have the ability to distinguish wealth, they undoubtedly rely on "theft" to survive. The writers who took the imperial examinations in the past were masters of this trick. I remember a joke that describes the general "copycat." Before entering the examination hall, the candidate stuffed many prepared "crib sheets" written in tiny characters into the small brush handle. When the examination question was released, he took out his treasures from the brush handle. It just so happened that there was an article among the treasures that was exactly on the topic. He copied it out with satisfaction, naturally believing that he would undoubtedly "pass with honors." Who knew that fate was perverse. The text on the crib sheet was abbreviated. Our copycat mistakenly wrote the first two words of the "introduction" (昔賢, "wise men," with 賢 abbreviated as 　) as "the twenty-first day ascends to heaven" (廿一日上天). As a result, the examiner picked up a vermilion pen before even reading the entire article and wrote six large characters: "Dare not detain the immortal." And so, a red hat was lightly sent away. This joke is the most vivid description of the ignorance of "copycats."</p>
<p>However, the "copying from here and there" in Gorky's passage does not refer to such shallow plagiarism, but is a further statement.</p>
<p>Gorky meant that to write scientific truths into children's reading material, simply copying from here and there and bringing out some scientific terms or principles verbatim is unsuccessful. The scientific language should be dissolved under one's own pen and become artistic language. Therefore, the cooperation of qualified scientists and outstanding writers is essential. Here, the so-called plagiarism is not only about understanding the problem, but also about dissolving the problem, not only about the size of the clippings, but also about the use of words. This is precisely aimed at the popular culture movement.</p>
<p>Using Gorky's words to explain the second question raised by Mr. Xu, we can say this:</p>
<p>To adapt world famous works into popular versions, not only must the language be popularized, but also the content must be popularized. The compiler must not distort the original work's views, but also cannot just circle within the original work's framework. For example, when compiling a popular version of a literary masterpiece, you cannot just excerpt passages from the original work and call it a day. You must write it in your own most popular language so that people see a completely new face. Otherwise, although it is called popular, it is not popular at all, and can only be regarded as "plagiarism." It is even more necessary to do this when adapting scientific masterpieces. Therefore, adaptation is not "plagiarism." A reviser who fails to dissolve the original work and only spits it out verbatim, without achieving the goal of popularization, is guilty of "plagiarism."</p>
<p>We hope that all those involved in the popular culture movement should pay attention to Gorky's passage.</p>

<p>The second Western Shanghai Small Ball Competition has been going on for three months. The situation of the championship in each group is gradually becoming clear.

In the West Group, Jingxiang C is in the lead with five wins and one draw, while Qixing A and Huajie are closely following behind. It is expected that the championship team in the West Group will be one of these three. In the Small Group, the champion is Luofang and the runner-up is Jinde. The overall situation is set.

<h3 id="e217">Great China University Establishes an Education Museum <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, Great China University has developed rapidly, earning a distinguished reputation. The number of students coming from afar has been increasing daily. The university's College of Education and Teacher Training Department are places for researching educational academics and training teachers, and have made great progress in recent years. The number of students has increased to more than 500. The professors are all talented individuals of the time. To facilitate students' exploration of education, an Educational Research Room has been established outside the university library. The collected educational reference books include more than 200 kinds of Chinese educational gazettes and magazines, more than 300 kinds of general gazettes and magazines, and more than 1,000 books on education, totaling more than 50,000 volumes. There are also about 1,000 Western books, including about 600 books on education, mostly works on the history of education and educational theories. There are about 5,000 copies of English educational magazines and pamphlets, with various items available. In addition, there are newspaper clippings from the Republic of China's 13th year to the present. Educational and socio-economic data related to education from more than a dozen famous domestic newspapers have been clipped onto large cards, totaling about 100,000 sheets. The wealth of collections is second to none among domestic universities. Recently, the university is planning to establish an Educational Research Institute and intends to expand the existing Educational Research Room into an Education Museum. The university affairs meeting has passed the resolution and is about to begin. It is heard that the organization of the museum will consist of three departments: research, compilation, and exhibition. The research department will establish various research rooms according to the research needs of the College of Education and the Teacher Training Department, collect reference materials on education, and set up various instruments. The compilation department will have (1) a clipping room, clipping materials from various newspapers, pasting them on cards, classifying and compiling them for reference; and (2) an index room, compiling indexes of educational papers published in various publications as tools for research. (According to this semester's work, it has already begun, and it is expected that 150,000 cards can be made.) The exhibition department will have four rooms: (1) a toy room, displaying various toys with educational significance; (2) an achievement room, displaying various achievements in educational administration, school education, and social education. The achievements of children's education are also attached here; (3) a teaching aid room, displaying educational specimens, models, health inspection equipment, and various educational tools; (4) a school equipment room, displaying various school-style equipment and physical education equipment, etc. Regarding the above equipment, in addition to transferring or supplementing the university's existing equipment, achievements, toys, etc. will be solicited from all parties at the university's tenth anniversary conference. As for school equipment and education, in addition to manufacturing a part by the students, the rest is planned to be solicited for long-term display, referring to the method of the Educational Reporting Bureau of the Prussian State of Germany, for exhibition and research. The required expenses are about 10,000 yuan for building the museum and about 2,000 yuan for equipment. Detailed budget is still being calculated. According to our country's educational research, the cause is still in its early stages. The special establishment of the Education Museum is still an initiative. Now, the university is dedicated to this, opening a new era in the history of education in our country.</p>

<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>The general education in Kobe has already been briefly described in the previous section. Now, I will record my observations from visiting various schools in the city, using the strengths of each school as a theme to inform the nation.</p>
<p>As I have repeatedly stated, the first school we visited was the Kobe Municipal Kitano Elementary School, on the morning of April 4th at 8:00 AM. We were guided by Shi Yunfeng, a classmate from Waseda University, and Dong Gongxu, the principal of the Kobe-Osaka Chinese Public School. Upon arrival, we saw the Chinese and Japanese flags flying side-by-side at the school gate, waving in the wind. All the faculty members stood beside the gate, bowing respectfully to welcome us into the auditorium. We were treated to a generous offering of tea and snacks. The female teachers brewed fragrant tea and served pastries, meticulously attentive to avoid any discourtesy. It is said that Japanese elementary schools have very few janitors; all miscellaneous tasks are handled by the faculty. Even taking tea and cleaning napkins, they did everything themselves. The school principal, Iwuo Tabuchi, is 43 years old and the youngest principal in Kobe. The citizens often use this as a topic of conversation. On that day, he had gone to Tokyo to attend the "National Elementary School Teachers' Development Association" and had not yet returned. The so-called Elementary School Teachers' Development Association is a revitalization association for elementary school teachers, the largest gathering in the Japanese education sector in recent years. Its purpose is to commemorate the birth of the crown prince and awaken 300,000 elementary school teachers to engage in the positive guidance of children and young people's thoughts. The meeting was held in Tokyo on April 1st. Emperor Showa attended and delivered an instruction, including an imperial edict stating:</p>
<p>"To invigorate national morality and lead to the prosperity of the nation, the foundation lies in elementary school education. Those in charge should strive diligently day and night." This kind of imperial edict is like the imperial decrees of our country in the past. It is the new goal of Japanese education, restoring the education goals of cultivating local customs and shaping character from that time. This covers the tenets of Confucianism and the key points of the New Life Movement, so I am not afraid of being tedious and elaborate on it.</p>
<p>The acting principal was Kiyokazu Wakitani, the school's guidance counselor. His welcoming speech was printed beforehand and distributed to us. After the greetings, we observed the physical exercises of the sixth-grade students. Male and female students were taught separately by male and female teachers at the same time and place. Each student's muscles were developed, their posture was graceful, and their spirit was full of energy. The observers were amazed. Despite the cold weather, they wore only a thermal shirt on their upper bodies and short pants on their lower bodies, with bare legs and feet. After only a moment of practice, each of them was dripping with sweat. The teachers' commands were exceptionally loud. Their brave and progressive state was like facing a great enemy. They first practiced preparatory exercises, individual flexibility exercises, rib cage exercises, vaulting horse exercises, and finally abdominal exercises, handstand exercises, and breathing exercises. What we noted here was: (1) every child has an opportunity to exercise, (2) every child's performance is above the standard level, (3) every child can develop their inherent nature, (4) various exercises emphasize hard training for boys and graceful aesthetics for girls, (5) physical education teachers are also homeroom teachers. I once heard a Japanese representative report at the World Health Education Conference that his country's physical education focuses on both the physical and spiritual aspects. The former is about the development of physique, and the latter is about the cultivation of temperament. The Ministry of Education established a physical education department in 1921, specializing in supervising physical training inside and outside schools. Even in remote rural areas, there are experts to guide physical education research associations. Physical education league associations were established ten years ago to engage in activities. There are countless physical education publications. It is not an exaggeration to call Japan a physical education nation. However, whether the object of their physical training is for the sake of physical education or for some other purpose is something that puzzles me.</p>
<p>Kobe is known for physical education in Japan, and Kitano is famous for physical education in Kobe. The acting principal, Wakitani, is a well-known figure in Japanese elementary school physical education. He studied in Switzerland for several years, specializing in Swiss gymnastics, and has written extensively. After returning to Japan, he continued to serve in elementary schools. He is sincere and kind, and every night he came to the hostel to talk and gave the reporter many books on health education. The reporter inquired about the physical education teaching materials of various schools. He said that the physical education teaching materials for Kobe elementary schools are unified throughout the city. Every school has morning assemblies where all teachers and students attend to exercise their bodies. Each day, sports meetings are held, and grand mass exercises take place daily. In addition to gymnastics, there are martial arts such as kendo, judo, and boxing. There is a reason for the health of the people of this nation.</p>
<p>Physical education is to a country what essence is to the human body. Looking broadly at China and foreign countries, there has never been a person without essence who is healthy, and even more so, there has never been a country without proper education that is strong. Physical education is probably a good medicine for curing the weakness of our nation. There are many Japanese elementary schools in Shanghai. All our elementary school teachers, at least principals and physical education teachers, should go to observe their physical education and think about how to thoroughly reform it. The wind and rain are dark, and the cock crows endlessly. The idea of holding a weapon to defend the country is widespread, awaiting the rise of physical education. The reporter is willing to offer enthusiasm, hoping that the people of the country will value physical education.</p>
<p>After the gymnastics class, we observed the preparation rooms for each subject. The so-called preparation room is a room that provides all the materials needed for teaching. For example, the geography preparation room has all the maps, models, products, instruments, etc., gathered in the room for teachers to use and students to practice. The same goes for each subject. We went to the sewing room and saw the students busy cutting and sewing. Girls can choose this course starting from the fifth grade. When starting to learn to use sewing machines, they first use paper to practice stepping on straight lines, then use an iron to smooth them. There are about a dozen sewing machines. Younger students can use hand-cranked machines.</p>
<p>After the observation, the school students performed various children's songs and dances such as the Moon Viewing Night Ball, the Feudal Lords, the Army Game, the Knights, the Air Fleet, the Hengjie, and the Prince. The content is all militarized, reflecting nothing but the samurai spirit of the Yamato people.</p>
<p>The school covers an area of 1,579 square meters, with 3,833 square meters of open space. The construction cost a total of 85,394 yen. The architectural style is modern reinforced concrete, three stories. Yet, they are still not satisfied and complain about the simplicity of the school building. It is common to see elementary school buildings in Japan costing over two million yen.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Records of Fragrant Incense <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>But the people in front were tired enough, they were not allowed to walk backwards; they had to face forward like the people behind, and then bend their arms backwards to hold the edges of the trays, walking slowly. Imagine: Each tray held three dragon robes, each tray carried by two eunuchs, so how long would this line be when the Empress Dowager wanted to inspect her clothes?</p>
<p>Since the Empress Dowager owned such a huge amount of clothing, she could of course change them at any time. But because their number was so excessive, even if she changed twice or three times a day, many clothes would never be worn; although their material was equally beautiful and their embroidery was equally exquisite, the Empress Dowager simply did not think of them for a while, and they had to be relegated to the cold palace! Some of them were emotional and commemorative, which were the clothes she wore when she first entered the palace as a noble concubine decades ago. Because of this commemorative relationship, although she never wore them again, she often had the eunuchs bring them out to play with, seemingly savoring them. At this time, I could often infer her inner feelings from her facial expressions. She was trying her best to recall her past beauty and many beautiful scenes and good times, and she also wanted to get some youthful joy from her illusions. So she always thought very intently, even for several minutes; when she was thinking intently, no one was allowed to speak to her, so as not to interrupt her thoughts. Even if I had something to report to her, 丨now that I think about it, I was very bold at that time, often ignoring how intently she was thinking, I still spoke as usual.丨She would never pay attention to me.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Such Paradise <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>Whenever Suzhou and Hangzhou are mentioned, everyone seems to hold an envious feeling, thinking that the people living there must have a comfortable life like living in paradise, and they can eat without worrying. That's right, Suzhou and Hangzhou have roads, banks, large hotels, dazzling neon lights, and the temptation of meat, the aroma of wine, etc.: so eating is good, living is good, wearing is good. In short, if a place doesn't have these, then it doesn't deserve to be called "paradise," then the title of paradise, Suzhou and Hangzhou can indeed be worthy of it, and the people living there are also worthy of pride.</p>
<p>I don't know what the situation is in Suzhou; now let's talk about Hangzhou.</p>
<p>A friend told me that he was returning from somewhere, a few steps away from his house, and was stopped by a rickshaw puller. He said sadly, "Sir, please take my rickshaw. From eight in the morning until almost noon now, I haven't found a single customer!" After saying that, the rickshaw puller was already in tears.</p>
<p>Pork is extremely cheap, one dollar can buy six catties! (market scale) Everyone is surprised, so it's a bargain, it seems that everyone can feast on it. However, whenever I walk past the butcher shop in the afternoon, I often see large pieces hanging on iron hooks, covered with white cloth, and the people in the shop often use brooms dipped in water to sprinkle on the meat.</p>
<p>From Yangbatou to Baoyoufang, what you see are phrases such as "regardless of cost," "add one and give five," "closing down sale," "special sacrifice," "this store always adheres to the principle of small profits"; what you hear are military music and ten-beat gongs and drums playing dirges wildly, with a very weeping and complaining tone. The colorful arches across the street, although still standing upright, smile bitterly at people, but who goes to squint at them!</p>
<p>If there are such scenes in paradise, then Hangzhou is truly enviable, but I don't know about Suzhou.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Suzhou is also like this. Alas, paradise!)</p>
<h3 id="e224">Standard of Living <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Weijing</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, someone earning one hundred yuan a year was already a top scholar, not to mention when it came to marriage, red horoscopes, whatever amount was asked, was given. Even when strolling leisurely on the street, the elders in the village would have to treat them with respect and courtesy, flattering them. In fact, at that time, one yuan could only be exchanged for eight hundred Kangxi large white coins. One hundred yuan a year, exchanged for only eighty thousand large coins.</p>
<p>Things are not right this year, someone earning one hundred yuan a month, although one yuan can be exchanged for three hundred and thirty copper coins, in reality, one hundred yuan is worth three hundred and thirty thousand "Kong Brothers," but in the eyes of most people, although it is not said to be enough to avoid begging, it is probably not seen as very desirable.</p>
<p>Only a difference of thirty years before and after, the difference in the standard of living has undeniably undergone a huge change. Look, one Kangxi large white coin from the past is worth so much more than a copper coin this year.</p>
<p>The current dollar price is always above three thousand. I have an absurd fantasy, if a copper coin now was really worth ten Kangxi large white coins from thirty years ago, then needless to say, there would never be traces of bandits and beggars in this world.</p>
<p>But, at present, the value of a copper coin is only worth a copper coin. I fear that thirty years from now, a double dime silver coin will probably not be worth the value of a copper coin today. By then, not to mention someone earning one hundred yuan a month not being able to survive, even someone earning one hundred yuan a day might have some difficulty.</p>

<p>Unable to find an envelope, he rummaged through the stationery box for a long time and found a sheet of form paper, which he folded into the shape of an envelope, wrapped the letter, wrote the recipient's name and address, and then quietly walked out. He found an acquaintance among the common people, held his hand, and said in a low voice: "Old fellow, I have something I want to ask you to do." As he said this, he took out a silver dollar from his pocket and stuffed it into his hand. The old fellow took the money, stared with wide eyes, not knowing how to answer. Ziqiang then stuffed the letter into his hand and said with a wry smile: "This is a letter to my family. Please do me a favor and take it to a town, buy some stamps, and mail it for me." The old fellow said: "Officer, I'll take it for you, buying some stamps won't cost that much money." Ziqiang said: "We're going to close the doors and fight here, money is useless. You're a refugee, carrying a dollar with you, it's a good thing, take it. As long as you're willing to take it there sooner or later, I'll be grateful beyond measure." The old fellow said: "Officer, everyone needs help sometimes, I'll definitely deliver it, you can rest assured." Ziqiang clasped his fists, bowed to him twice, and then turned and left. In this way, he seemed to have gained great comfort, as if a lump was stuck in his chest, and he had now taken it out. Whenever soldiers miss their families, they have no other way to relieve this pain, only two ways to seek comfort. One is to receive a letter from home, and the other is to write a letter to home. But receiving a letter from home is not an easy thing, almost never happening. So when Ziqiang wrote the words on the letter, it was as if he was talking to his family. Sending the letter out was like his family hearing him. On the last day of preserved communication, he had to send this letter to his family, and his heart was very happy. With no more worries, he started working according to the battalion commander's orders. (◯ Seven)</p>

<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>Plato said: "A woman's whole life is enveloped in love." This statement is somewhat overly focused on the female side. In fact, whether male or female, when the flame of youth burns most fiercely, they need the comfort of love.</p>
<p>Speaking of love, some people see it as too mysterious, even taking it as an ultimate thing, worshiping it like an idol foolishly, humiliating themselves in a crazy manner, and burying their happiness and lives in this infatuated soil. That piece of their true, ardent love is sure to gain the sympathy and pity of the general public.</p>
<p>However, there are other people with opposite personalities, whose attitude is frivolous and unfaithful. Their devotion to love fails to last and be dedicated. They often use love as a means of deception, fooling and ruining the other party. Like these people, they are all prisoners waiting for trial before the seat of the god of love.</p>
<p>It is said that in the latest work of the star, the movie "Enemy of Women", the story is tightly based on this point, showing the typical figures of two men in society, one is infatuated, the other is a deceiver, and at the same time, the true meaning of love and the dynamic changes are fully developed and severely criticized. May friends who talk about love and say love, go to the fabric of its scenes, to see all the ugly and beautiful grinding of the exposed posture!</p>

<h3 id="e227">Prevention and Elimination of the Four Major Pests of Summer <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>As the summer season arrives, the climate is getting hotter, and various harmful insects will multiply day by day in the future. During this period, we should pay attention to prevention to avoid being harmed by infectious diseases. Among the harmful insects, the most dangerous one is the fly. According to surveys by hygienists, the number of germs in a fly ranges from as few as five hundred and fifty to as many as six million six hundred thousand. The majority of these germs are E. coli from human and animal feces. These bacteria are the source of cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and other diseases. Flies like to eat these bacteria very much, often eating their fill, or vomiting them from their mouths, or excreting them from their anuses. Therefore, in summer, the walls, tables, clothes, and utensils in the room, after the flies have stepped on them, the fecal spots left behind, when viewed under a microscope, contain from one thousand to one million germs. Adding the germs brought by the flies' feet, there are at least more than fifteen thousand. If we eat them directly (from fruits and delicacies) or indirectly (using hands to bring them in from utensils), we will get sick. Flies grow very quickly, from egg to adult, in more than half a month. Flies love the color rose, and the most disliked colors are green, purple, and red. If the windows are fitted with glass of red, purple, and green colors, then flies will not be able to tolerate living indoors. Fly-killing drugs include kerosene emulsion, borax, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform (a colorless, transparent, strongly volatile substance with a foul odor and good sterilization properties), ether, gasoline, chloropicrin, etc. However, fly pupae are more resistant to insecticides than maggots. Therefore, using a 10% solution of cresol soap liquid can completely eliminate them in five minutes. Using a 10 to 20 times diluted kerosene emulsion can also kill 80 to 90 percent of them.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes</p>
<p>Mosquitoes are also one of the vectors of infectious diseases. There are two hundred species of mosquitoes. One laying produces at least seventy or eighty eggs and up to three or four hundred eggs. The basic requirements for mosquito control are (1) clear the drainage of sewage ditches, (2) cut down weeds around ponds and rivers, (3) tidy up the cleanliness of wet places, (4) pour kerosene on the water surface to prevent mosquitoes from breeding in the water, (5) if in the room, to prevent them from disturbing at night, camphor, pyrethrum, and duckweed can be mixed and burned in the room, and the mosquitoes will definitely flee.</p>
<p>Fleas</p>
<p>There are human fleas, dog fleas, cat fleas, and rat fleas. To prevent the occurrence of fleas, first, sweep the room clean, and second, often sprinkle with stinky medicine. Dog and cat fleas can be controlled by mixing camphor, pyrethrum, and naphthalene disinfectant and applying it to the fur of dogs and cats or spreading it on the bedding, which can definitely drive them away.</p>
<p>Bedbugs</p>
<p>Bedbugs reach their egg-laying period in the plum rain season. Before laying eggs, special attention should be paid to driving them away. During this period, it is best to use steam disinfection and kerosene spraying in the crevices of partitions, the frame of the bed, and dry, dark places. However, these pests are most common in poor families. Steam disinfection is ultimately not possible, and kerosene spraying poses a fire hazard. According to my experience, it is best to rinse with boiling water, or mix crab shells, spicy eggplants, and papayas in wood shavings, tightly close the doors and windows to prevent leakage, and burn them indoors. This can completely eliminate them, but when burning, this smoke is very strong, and we will feel dizzy when we touch this smoke. Therefore, after burning, be sure to open the doors and windows first, and do not touch this smoke too much. If we want a quiet night on the road, we can add realgar to salt water and spray it on the bed frame.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Awakening from Illusion <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Feixin</p>
<p>Everyone always goes from small to big. The most valuable thing is old age, and the most important thing is youth. Problems that old people don't consider important are big problems for young people. Therefore, youth problems, even if they are considered pitiful and ridiculous, are big problems. All wise people, those who understand, those who have experience and ideas, should provide guidance.</p>
<p>Just as the purpose of fruit is to rot and regrow into better fruit. In the journey of life, everyone is a passerby: like those who visit mountains and rivers, they should point out the best scenic spots to those who come later, and of course point out the dangerous places, or flatten them for those who come.</p>
<p>So many people say: experience is knowledge, which is correct. Apart from life, what is the use of academic knowledge? There is none. Many people read books, but if it has nothing to do with oneself or others, it does not count as knowledge.</p>
<p>But simply imparting experience has both advantages and disadvantages. The motive is commendable, but the selection of skills must be cautious. Ruan Ji's son asked to drink alcohol, but Ruan Ji refused, "My family already has Ah Xian," which is exactly the behavior of a philosopher, which is not to center on oneself and teach the world to learn from oneself.</p>
<p>But looking at old families sometimes educating their children, teaching them to gamble, they want them not to lose; teaching them martial arts, they hope they will not be defeated; teaching them to wander, they want them not to be desolate. The most common thing is to teach them to socialize and hope they will conform to the world. Although it is the intention of the benevolent, it is quite far from the way of education.</p>
<p>That mistake is still because it is centered on oneself. If young people are taken as young people, they have their own development and future. Many situations and environments have changed, and the old methods are useless. This kind of mistake can be avoided.</p>
<p>There is no regret for self-gain and self-loss, the regrettable thing is repeated mistakes; there is not enough sorrow for those who move forward and collapse, the sad thing is treading on the same mistakes. 丨丨 We see the suffering of many young people today, there are conflicts with their families, there are disputes with the opposite sex. In fact, all parties have good intentions, but they get bad results. Who sees the motive? The crux is here.</p>
<p>Therefore, Buddha said to advocate no emotion, and Legalists are strict and have little kindness.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Miscellaneous Notes on Reading "Imperial Ming Dynasty Novels" <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Everyone knows that in modern novels there is "The Travels of Lao Ts'an." Readers of "The Travels of Lao Ts'an" also know that there is Daming Lake in Jinan, and even more know that there is the Temple of Tie Xuan on Daming Lake, and the tragic death of Tie Xuan. However, no one can tell the tragic situation of Tie Xuan's family after his death. Even Hu Shi, who is as broad as having "the addiction to textual research and history," does not seem to have mentioned it in his research.</p>
<p>Recently, I read Wang Ao's "Zhenze J闻," and there is a passage that involves this matter, saying that after Tie Xuan was killed, "his family members were sent to the Jiaofang as prostitutes. Xuan had two daughters, who both swore not to be humiliated. When Emperor Renzong ascended the throne, he pardoned them, and they both married court officials. The two daughters wrote poems to describe themselves. The elder daughter's poem says:</p>
<p>The Jiaofang's rouge washes away the leaden brilliance,</p>
<p>A peaceful heart faces the falling flowers.</p>
<p>Listening to the old tunes, there is still resentment,</p>
<p>Returning to the old garden, there is no home.</p>
<p>A cloud is half tied before the dressing mirror,</p>
<p>Rain and tears flow in vain, wetting the crimson gauze.</p>
<p>Today I meet Bai Sima,</p>
<p>I retell my pipa story before the wine.</p>
<p>Her younger sister's poem says:</p>
<p>Flesh and blood are wounded and the old business is barren,</p>
<p>How can this body bear to return to prostitution?</p>
<p>Tears fall like jade strings, leaving the official residence,</p>
<p>Stepping on golden lotuses, entering the Jiaofang.</p>
<p>Looking in the mirror, I pity my captivating appearance,</p>
<p>Shamed to learn the makeup of a woman leaning against the door.</p>
<p>Spring brings rain and dew as wide as the sea,</p>
<p>Marrying a Tao Lang is better than a Ruan Lang.</p>
<p>The former of the two poems is better, because it expresses sorrow and resentment, and a sense of unyielding to the officials, which is much superior to her sister's inevitable "spring rain and dew" in terms of personality, and the former is superior to the latter not only in terms of poetic technique. I specially record this to tell the readers of "The Travels of Lao Ts'an."</p>
<p>(II) Since the Yuan brothers of the Ming Dynasty advocated expressing nature and spirit, and clarifying the true meaning of language, there was a lot of debate for a while. Some sympathized with the Public Security School and opposed Li and Wang, some supported Li and Wang and opposed the Public Security School, some did not comment, and some disagreed with both. Chen Yubi belonged to the last group. He said:</p>
<p>"When writing, there is no need to discuss oddity or antiquity, but one must form one's own opinion. Reading it from beginning to end makes sense, without any omissions, then it is a good article, and one can also observe the person's actions, career, and enjoyment. Nowadays, people only seek novelty and plagiarism, without any heartfelt and true views. I compare it to an ordinary person wearing a cloth robe, which is still good clothing. If it is cut and patched with silk and satin, although it is expensive, it is not complete clothing after all. If a poor family eats beans and millet, it is still good food. If a beggar gets wine and meat from the grave, although it is a lot, it is ultimately cheap and shameful." This is seen in Yubi's book "Opinions," showing dissatisfaction with both sides and forming his own third faction. However, comparatively speaking, sympathy for the Public Security School is better than that for Yu Lin and Yuan Mei. The literary situation at that time can be seen from this.</p>
<p>(III) Li Bai of the Tang Dynasty, people only know him as a poet, but do not know that his prose also has the same style as his poems. Gu Yuanqing's " 曝偶谈" once asked Hu Wenmu to transcribe his three posts.</p>
<p>The first one says: "Riding a boat and treading on the moon, in a Westerner's tavern, I unknowingly forget both people and things, and my body is outside the world."</p>
<p>The second one says: "Waking up under the moon at night, the shadows of flowers fall and bid farewell, filling my chest, as if washing my soul in an ice pot."</p>
<p>The third one says: "The building is empty and the moon is white, the autumn sky transforms everything, leaning on the railing here, my life is flying, holding the wine and forgetting myself, where does this carriage go?" Yuanqing said that this post "cannot be said by anyone but Taibai," which can be said to be true.</p>
<p>(IV) Tian Rucheng's "Alleyway Anecdotes" has a legend about the Water Margin, which is very strange. It says, "Luo Guanzhong of Qiantang was a man of the Southern Song Dynasty. He compiled dozens of novels, and the preface to the Water Margin describes the treacherous thefts of Song Jiang and others in great detail. However, the changes and deceptions are endless, corrupting people's minds, and his descendants for three generations were all dumb. Such is the reward of good fortune. "This kind of legend is not known on what it is based. It seems unreliable.</p>
<p>(V) Many people in the Ming Dynasty learned the lifestyle of Su Dongpo. At that time, some people criticized it as "people of this world, nowhere are they not Su." I have recorded it before. Recently, I read Zhang Fengyi's Tan Lu, and I also saw a passage saying that "in recent times, scholars and officials often take a monk with them when they retire from illness, in order to show their loftiness. People see it and say that it is the work of Su Changgong and Foyin." The literary customs at that time can be seen from this. If today the Panchen Lama is able to hold Vajra Dharma meetings in Hangzhou, and is welcomed everywhere from top to bottom, it also has a Su flavor, but its function is even greater than calling oneself lofty.</p>
<p>(VI) Legendary operas flourished in the Yuan and Ming dynasties. Hong Wenke recorded in "Glimpses of the Past and Present," "In the past, heroes and chivalrous men, secret plans and wonderful strategies, were delightful and surprising, and truly illuminated the ages. Taishi Gong recorded them in detail. However, how many people in the world are scholars who wield pens and examine books? How many ordinary men and women are ignorant of them?</p>
<p>Our dynasty's poets and writers wrote about Washing Yarn, Hong Fu, Stealing Talismans, and Throwing Pens, etc., in which there are generous and tragic songs, and elegant and outstanding men who established world-shaking achievements, and chivalrous women with transcendent and great knowledge, composing them into lyrics and operas, performing them on the stage, so that the events of that year are vividly in front of our eyes. All those with blood and energy know to strive for excellence. This is truly a help to stimulate people's hearts, and can be called a grand achievement. If one only regards this as the same as puppets in terms of sound and clothing and laughs at them together, then one is truly a wooden or stone person." Using the perspective of carrying the Tao to discuss the Yuan and Ming operas is certainly not entirely correct, but the reason why the Yuan and Ming operas developed completely due to the reason of popularization, the reason of being easy to understand, can also be seen in this section.</p>
<p>(VII) I have already remembered a lot about the past events of non-resistanceism. However, this kind of material can still be picked up at will. The origin of non-resistanceism in China truly makes people have deep thoughts. Wang Qi's "Miscellaneous Records of Yupu" records one of the events: "Yang, Mr. Zhu, was a compiler, living in the capital. A neighbor lost a chicken and scolded him by his surname. His family members told him, and Mr. Yang said, 'In the market, I am not the only one with the surname Yang.' Also, a neighbor's residence is very narrow, and when it rains, water must flow out from Mr. Yang's house, suffering a lot from its dampness. His family members reported it again, and Mr. Yang explained, 'There are more sunny days than rainy days.' His virtue is like this." According to this, two more non-resistanceists have been added in history.</p>
<p>(VIII) In the notes of the predecessors, there are often small articles full of interest. Written casually, with a few words, they fully express the beauty. I especially like to choose and record them. Wang Shimao's "酉委谭" also has no shortage of such texts, such as:</p>
<p>"On May 12th, I returned from the county town and slept very tired at night. I hated to hear the sound of mosquitoes, and did not sleep for a long time. The street drum was about to move, and I finally fell asleep. Suddenly, the sound of gurgling outside the window made me hope for rain. Lying half awake on a bamboo bed with a cloth quilt, I called the servant girl to beat me, and I listened to it all. I felt that the tired bear was completely revived. Checking my chest, there was nothing at all, only the topic for my son's composition had been given the night before. As I tossed and turned, I heard my old wife calling, probably urging the servants to collect yellow plum water and pick jasmine flowers. She is doing this unnecessary task again, I smiled. I put on my clothes and got up, combed my hair, burned incense, and finished reciting the scriptures. I went out and sat in the Xinyuan Hall, picked up a pen, stretched out the paper, and wrote a few lines to record it."</p>
<h3 id="e230">Talking About Ghosts <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Lingmo</p>
<p>Every day, I just flip through the newspaper casually. I can't figure out big things, and I can't take care of small things. But since I'm reading the newspaper, I always want people to think that "the scholar doesn't go out but knows everything in the world." Today, the cook who delivers food asked me again how the ghost in Zhabei was reported in the newspaper. He was preparing to go and see it from afar in the afternoon, so he asked me to collect some reference materials for him. Seeing his enthusiasm, I took a deep breath myself.</p>
<p>Zhang Jiuguan's "Scientific Spirit Planchette Chart" has not yet made people feel that there are too many ghosts, so new spiritual miracles are constantly being created. Although Mr. Zhitang's "Listening to Talk About Ghosts in the Streets All Day Long" has already been scolded a lot, judging from the news in Shanghai, I dare not say that it is not a fact. In the eyes of people in Beijing, Shanghai has long been a paradise, and Shanghai is also unavoidable to see ghosts. It is conceivable that Beijing has long been filled with ghost stories.</p>
<p>In such an economic downturn, there is inevitably a lot of vacant space that cannot be rented out. People in Shanghai, who are used to every inch of land being gold, are not yet used to thinking about why houses cannot be rented out, so they naturally turn to making a fuss about the auspicious character in "auspicious house for rent." In the past, rooms in large restaurants where suicides had occurred would be moved into immediately before the blood stains were dry, but now they may be empty for several months.</p>
<p>Except for winning the lottery, it is now difficult for people to hope for unexpected good luck. No matter what business they are engaged in, they shake their heads when they talk about it, and they fail when they do it. The two words "inauspicious" lie in everyone's heart. No matter how this ghost in Zhabei is proven to be empty, it will still add a dark ghost to every inauspicious home.</p>
<p>Even people who don't believe in ghosts are often moved out of an unfortunate house, and some even move several times a week from here to there. There are too many shadows of all kinds, and it is not necessarily a stupid blessing to attribute them to ghosts.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Snakes and Myths <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Shushan</p>
<p>It is clearly the year of the dog this year, but the snake insists on stealing the show.</p>
<p>We only need to look at the recent bizarre news about snakes that has been constantly published in the newspapers of Beijing and Shanghai to know that snakes are indeed蠢然思动.</p>
<p>For example: First, a large snake suddenly appeared on the main road in the southern suburbs of Zhenjiang, about ten feet long, binding a farmer, who died of serious injuries. This is, of course, not losing the nature of the snake as a poisonous insect (see "Central Daily News," June 7). Another example is that in the Vienna Dance Hall in Shanghai, just as it was drunken and gold-obsessed, nine strange snakes were suddenly found, which frightened the male and female dancers, and the whole hall was in an uproar. This is another prank by someone.</p>
<p>The most strange thing is the snake that surrounded and protected the girl in Changzhou, and the snake that crowded the bride's sedan chair in Pudong. The former is: "Shi Dewen, a shipowner in Changzhou, and his wife, Shi, gave birth to a son and a daughter each. Recently, they brought back a three-month-old girl from the northern township, intending to raise her as their son's wife. However, the girl was weak and sick due to lack of milk, and soon died. Shi was cruel and wrapped the girl in a cattail bag and sent her to the mountain tomb at night. The next day, a passerby heard a child crying in the tomb and followed the sound to watch. He only saw a snake more than ten feet long, coiled beside the child, protecting her. Several wild dogs stood beside her, wanting to grab the child but dare not. He was very surprised and reported it to the authorities. When the matter became clear, Shi was arrested, and the girl was sent to the orphanage in the city for support." (See "Fiction Monthly," June issue) This snake can truly be said to be a benevolent and righteous snake, almost comparable to the tiger that nursed Chu Ling Yin Ziwen in the Spring and Autumn period.</p>
<p>The latter is seen in the Shanghai newspapers of June 7, the general idea is: "Cao Quanlin, the son of Cao Yinshan in Pudong, was betrothed to Sister Huang Quanlin, a farmer's daughter, when he was young, and had sexual relations before marriage. The crystallization of love is now five months old, so they are marrying early. At that time, the wedding was extravagant and the officials were all present. However, a huge blue-yellow snake, more than ten feet long, suddenly came head-on to the bride's sedan chair in the Guanyin Hall area west of Zhangjiang shed, and went straight into the sedan chair. The bride was frightened and cried out. When the gong was sounded to drive it away, the snake actually raised half of its body, raised its head and bowed, and hissed as if it were sad. After the snake was driven down, the wedding party hurriedly ordered the sedan chair to be carried away, but after traveling a mile, the snake appeared again in front of them. After driving it away again, they finally welcomed her home and got married." It is not known what the reason for this snake is. Could it be that it also has some opinions on this kind of "early transaction, auspicious opening" new marriage?</p>
<p>These two news items are like re-enacting the stories of the mythological era. That's right, snakes have never been separated from the mythical nature in people's minds, regardless of whether they are insects or gods and monsters.</p>
<p>According to the "Historical Records," the people of ancient times, such as Fu Xi and Nu Wa, were all strange people with snake bodies and human heads. When Yu opened the Dragon Gate, he saw a snake god and taught Yu the method of pacifying the land and water. According to "Shi Yi Ji," this was Emperor Xi. Also, "Zuo Zhuan" said that there were snakes fighting inside and outside the south gate of Zheng, which was called a demon. Secondly, there is the legend of "snake beads" in "Sou Shen Ji." The myths of snakes are truly countless.</p>
<p>In foreign countries, there are also many ancient mythological legends about snakes. The "Genesis" in the "Old Testament" records the situation in which the ancestors of mankind, Eve and Adam, were tempted by snakes to steal and eat the fruit of the tree, which is the most powerful one.</p>
<p>In short, snakes are too naughty. The more people are tempted by it to fall, and then hate it, fear it, but also respect it, the more tricks it will come up with and the more skillful it will become.</p>
<p>Recently, the Chinese have been fascinated by its skillful tricks, and are reversing the times.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Fire (VIII) <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Fei'er</p>
<p>At first glance, the flames were burning on the second and third shops on the left. The sirens had already started. The fire was so fierce that it went straight up, almost twenty or thirty feet high, illuminating the sky red. The flames filled the sky. The smell of burning things was in the air, and the sound of things exploding could be heard. The flames were spitting in and out, and the wind was driving them, pushing them from one side to the other. Sometimes things like kerosene tanks were seen thrown high into the sky after an explosion, and then falling down again. The sound of the wind, the sound of the fire, the sound of things exploding, and the cries of all the people and dogs mixed together in the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>At the moment, many coolies and many natives were doing the work of moving goods and fighting the fire, coming and going in confusion and haste. On the riverside, the precious shallow water of the receding tide was transported; in front, water was poured into the flames. As soon as the water was poured, the fire subsided, and then it burned even more vigorously. Brave firefighters were dismantling the house on the third right; but the fire was chasing after it faster with the wind. This made it impossible for the firefighters to do anything, especially in this municipally incomplete village.</p>
<p>Seeing that human power was no use, everyone's faces were covered with earthy colors. The women's cries shook the sky, and the men were dumbfounded. Seeing this foundation that had stood for decades or even hundreds of years being destroyed in this moment: seeing the place where thousands of people's livelihoods were entrusted being destroyed, who would not cry for their own history and life!</p>
<p>Here, I found my friend Zhang Wensheng again. I saw him barefoot, tired and frustrated, his face covered with a layer of muddy gray, lying on a small pile of wreckage like he was seriously ill, dying.</p>
<p>I thought that the prediction in the afternoon was actually fulfilled within this day, no, these few hours; I thought about how I strangely ran tens of thousands of miles from the country to participate in this tragedy. Here, watching my little friend from ten years ago trapped in the disasters of life, fulfilling the situation that he had been fearing day and night in his heart, what words would I use to comfort him?</p>
<p>"Friend, be safe! Nothing else matters, listen to the instructions of heaven!" I swallowed these useless words.</p>
<p>"Yes, it does matter, what's going on?" Then, he hissed. I saw his anger as strong as fire.</p>
<p>We were silent. Under this disaster, there was no other way but to silently pass the sad time.</p>
<p>The wind was still driving the fire, and with the help of the fierce burning medium in the burning shops, the fire was getting more lively and more violent. At this time, in the cold wind of this late night, in my heart, it was terribly lonely and empty! My body was shaking constantly; in this red-hot country, I had never felt so cold.</p>
<p>The sky was gradually getting light, and the morning sun was gradually climbing from the east. As soon as the red glow in the east matched the flames, the fire gradually reduced its intense color.</p>
<p>The sun slowly climbed up from the ground, and as soon as its brilliance appeared, the fire gradually subsided. The wind, showing a low mood, had been blowing all night, and now it was gradually tending to stop. People's sad hearts were expressed on their faces, and this tragic expression was clearly exposed in this bright morning. Looking at the site of the shops on the left, which had become ashes, and on the right, the fire was gradually extinguishing, was it about to be extinguished?</p>
<p>This fire lasted until about nine o'clock in the morning before it was completely extinguished. As soon as it dawned, the Dutch government's county magistrate had rushed from the county government office forty miles away on a small steamboat, and immediately cooperated with the local chief (13) to assign police and soldiers to extinguish the remaining fire that was gradually going out. And they sent many natives to build simple "Atta Cu" in the square to accommodate these fire-stricken refugees. In the morning, many pots of hot porridge were also cooked from the chief's palace to comfort these victims. I enjoyed a bowl of porridge given by the Dutch government in this place tens of thousands of miles away from my country, and I will never forget this in my life.</p>
<p>(Note 13) Before the Nanyang Islands were managed by Europeans, they were originally not unified. They were still in the tribal era, and a small place was governed by a chief. After these places were managed by Europeans, the chieftain system was still preserved, and the colonial government gave them a little bit of minor rights, which they were happy to use to help govern the natives.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Gold and Currency: US Senate Passes Silver Bill, Gold Price Surges by 2.4 Yuan, Silver Tax Limited to Speculators, Final Situation is Weaker, Summer Solstice Holiday on the 16th <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market rose due to the US Senate passing the silver bill, with the amendment of the silver profit tax, greatly reducing the excitement, and finally fell back after rising high with the saying that the silver tax is limited to speculators. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market in the UK and the US both declined slightly, the futures silver price on the Gold Exchange also fell by 6 hao to 1 li each, the exchange rate shrank slightly, the price of raw gold in London rose by 1 pence, the stock price fell by 1.08 yuan, the price of US cotton fell by 8 pound notes, the price of US wheat rose and fell slightly, and the off-site opening was flat. The Associated Press reported that the US Senate had passed the silver bill, and the price rose. Later, Reuters also sent the same message, but successively the US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced that in the past week, he had purchased 5 million ounces of silver from London, and everyone believed that the equalization fund would be used to pay. Therefore, after opening, it retreated slightly, but people's minds were encouraged by the complete passage of the silver bill, and there was no hope of amending the silver profit tax, so it was strongly firm. Large households then covered their short positions, and bulls also increased their positions. The gold price then broke through 20 yuan. However, due to the supply of banks' appetites, it fluctuated, but people's minds were firm and there was a lot of short covering, and the industry continued to push hard and rose further. At noon, the buying wind in the market turned flat due to some supplies for hedging. In the afternoon, the Seattle night market silver price rose by 125.25.125, and the market opened flat. However, the potential for sales by customer groups eventually weakened, and speculator Wu also supplied. The transactions in the market were mostly offloaded, and the market situation became unsustainable. The foreign telegrams also said that the silver profit tax was only limited to speculators, so it broke the 20 yuan mark, and people's minds turned tired, and they were sold off one after another, which was even weaker.

<h3 id="e235">Silver and Money Industry Approaching the Summer Festival <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>Interbank Lending Remains Steady</p>
<p>An Additional Quarter Percent for "Hua Tou"</p>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions saw a slight improvement due to the approaching Summer Festival (Dragon Boat Festival) and the increased demand for funds, which was higher than usual. The interbank lending market for foreign currency remained at 8% in both the morning and afternoon sessions, unchanged from the previous two days. Due to wider demand, the "hua tou" (a type of short-term loan) market saw more demand than supply, leading to a rate of 0.25%, an increase of 0.125% from the previous day. This phenomenon has not been seen in months. However, in reality, it is due to the traditional emphasis on the Dragon Boat Festival, resulting in increased spending, rather than a genuine advancement in society's economic capacity. The trading volume of interbank lending bills was over 4.4 million in the morning session for transfers and new transactions and over 200,000 in the afternoon session. Trading in the Small General Association totaled over 300,000. Transactions involving foreign currency collateral loans saw over 900,000 redeemed, over 800,000 issued, and over 400,000 collected in cash. Bank receipts and payments were relatively stable. Foreign banks received and paid over 1.9 million in bills, over 3.3 million in various goods, foreign exchange, collateral loans, and miscellaneous receipts and payments, over 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, and 300,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Chinese banks received and paid over 2.6 million in bills, over 4 million in various goods, foreign exchange, collateral loans, and miscellaneous receipts and payments, over 400,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 500,000 in customs duties, and 400,000 in imports and exports. Japanese banks received and paid over 2.1 million in bills, over 3.2 million in various goods, foreign exchange, collateral loans, and miscellaneous receipts and payments, and 600,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Money shops received and paid over 38 million in foreign currency public notes, over 4.2 million in foreign currency "hua tou" loans, over 800,000 in banknotes recovered, over 600,000 in banknotes issued, over 300,000 in remittances from various routes, 200,000 in customer sources, and 300,000 in payments. Furthermore, the total exchange volume of the local clearing house on the 12th was 7,128,237.24 silver dollars, including 3,145,946.24 silver dollars and 3,982,291 silver dollars in drafts.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Huge Amount of Silver Shipped to Europe <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>10 Million Silver Dollars and 2.5 Million Taels of Silver Ingots</p>
<p>Since the United States raised the price of silver, foreign banks in the city have been continuously shipping silver to Europe and America. Yesterday, another foreign bank exported a huge amount of silver, consisting of 2,000 boxes of silver dollars (approximately 5,000 yuan per box), totaling 10 million yuan, and 2.5 million taels of silver ingots made from silver, loaded onto a foreign freighter that departed yesterday afternoon for England.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Securities: Prices Rebound in Chaos <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange market unexpectedly entered a state of chaos. Because of Mr. Zang's affair, it was mysteriously chaotic, and unfathomable, and he has been missing for three or four days now. The longer the night, the more dreams occur, which is particularly unfavorable to our country. The future situation is really unpredictable. Yesterday, because there were too many overnight shorts, many had to cover. But the price ratios of the various securities are very different. The opening price had a look of cutting off the long to make up for the short to make it balanced. So the "Disband Troops" bond rose about 0.6 yuan, while "Gold Short" rose 0.6 yuan on the positive side and 0.1-0.2 yuan on the reverse side. In the afternoon, the "Twenty-Second Customs" bond continued to be good at 0.3-0.4 yuan, and the rest also rose 0.1-0.2 yuan, while the consolidated salt tax has been relatively weak. In the afternoon, after the market opened, the situation was chaotic, and bonds such as numbers 14 and 38 were heavily sold, while bonds such as numbers 31 and 43 were absorbed. The market prices rose and fell inconsistently, with a difference of about 0.05 to 0.25 yuan. At closing, all recovered slightly by 0.1-0.2 yuan, which shows that most of the long positions did not dare to hold overnight. As a result of market prices, "Compilation" and "Disband Troops" bonds and 19 good bonds rose 0.8-0.9 yuan, and the rest rose 0.2-0.3 yuan. "Gold Short" and "Twenty-Second Customs" bonds rose only 0.05-0.1 yuan. Forward salt tax and "Gold Short" bonds still fell slightly by 0.05 yuan. According to market sentiment observations, prices will not plummet quickly. However, Mr. Zang's affair, even if it is not expanded, and there is no solution for a time, it is not easy to achieve a peaceful resolution. There are many rumors in foreign reports, and it is difficult to be optimistic for a while. The total trading volume was 14,672,200 yuan. The results of the highest, lowest, and closing prices, as well as the increase and decrease, are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (the 11th) the stock market fluctuated and declined. This was due to the fact that the labor strike in the steel industry has not been resolved. Auburn Automobile Company is scheduled to cancel dividends from July 1, and several companies have reduced car prices. As a result, automobile stocks were weak. Wall Street believes that automobile sales are not as good as generally imagined. As a result, long positions were closed. However, the market rebounded slightly before closing. Gold and silver stocks were generally slightly higher. Most copper mills notified the copper industry authorities that the domestic copper price would increase to 9 cents, an increase of 0.5 cents. So copper stocks were relatively firm. The market conditions on the small exchange were mixed. Wheat fluctuated due to rain in the western United States and Canada. This firm's New York agent reports: (Securities) Supplies increased slightly, the market was dull but still firm. (Wheat) Rainfall was insufficient and too late, it is necessary to buy when prices fall. (Cotton) The weather in the eastern United States has improved. According to private sources, there will be rainfall in Texas. July long positions were closed, and there were sporadic sales in the South. When prices fall, demand from peers and abroad is still high. Export sales of spot goods have improved more than before, and the base is firm. (Rubber) Prices fell due to retail sales, but Singapore and London are firm, and prices are higher than in New York. (Silver) The market is dull and uninteresting. All parties are waiting for definite news from Washington. The total trading volume for the day was 750,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The yarn market continues to be weak, and the situation is quite soft. This is because spot yarn sales are stagnant, and raw cotton is loosening, which has dampened sentiment. Short sellers are slightly active, and the market is slowly declining. But large buyers are still calm, believing that there are still no loopholes in the overseas cotton market, and that sales to customers after the holiday may develop. Therefore, the amount absorbed has remained untouched.</p>

<p>At the opening of the marked yarn market in the morning, due to the decline in US cotton and the weak buying interest in the market, prices for all months fell slightly. By the third sale, it was heard that public bonds had rebounded, which boosted sentiment slightly and caused prices to rebound. As a result, prices for all months fell by 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.06 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were light. The opening was still good, but prices suddenly fell during the second and third sales. As a result, prices for all months fell again by 0.02, 0.04, 0.05, and 0.06 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 31,300 bales. According to the investigation, Tongji sold 750 bales, Daji 1,450 bales, Shenchang 600 bales, Junchang 550 bales, Changfeng 1,600 bales, Hengchang 900 bales, and Deji 850 bales. Renfeng bought 700 bales, Zhengda 750 bales, Huikang 2,150 bales, Dafu 500 bales, Yuanfeng 1,650 bales, Yichang 550 bales, Yuande 450 bales, and Tongfu 400 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows.</p>

<p>Sales of spot yarn are still weak. According to the statistics for the whole day, various merchant groups bought only 311-312 bales. The market price fell by 0.05 yuan. The purchase amounts of various merchant groups are as follows.</p>
<p>Sichuan: 150 bales, Inland: 70 bales, Colleagues: 10 bales</p>

<p>The cotton market is trending downwards. After a large number of long positions were released by long companies, the market became loose, and there was a lack of buyers. As a result, the market is quite weak. However, general retail longs, in view of the fact that there are still no loopholes in foreign cotton, are holding on tightly and not letting go. Sales of spot cotton are even more sluggish. However, it is still difficult to see a major drop in US cotton news.</p>

<p>At the opening of the marked cotton market in the morning, the atmosphere in the market was scattered, and the situation was very weak. US cotton fell again, and although Indian cotton rose, it was still difficult to excite the market. Prices for all months fell again by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. In the afternoon, there were still few buyers, and prices for all months fell again by 0.1-0.2 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 80,100 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool, but later declined due to sales from the South and the closing of long positions. As a result, spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures prices fell by 7-9 points. English cotton futures rose by 8 points. Indian cotton rose due to purchases by speculators, Japanese merchants, and brokers. As a result, "Ping Guo Er" rose 2.5 rupees, "Ao Mu La" rose 3 rupees and 2.5 anglets, and "Bai Luo Xi" rose 4 rupees. The original telegram record is on the left (telegraph on the 11th):</p>

<h3 id="e247">Grains: Later Flour Market Has Floating Longs Appear <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw an active and positive trend in all months after opening in the morning. Due to foreign wheat quotations, Chicago was slightly up by 0.25 cents, and Canada was up by around 0.2 yuan. Therefore, after the opening price, sentiment was quite brisk. In addition, off-market longs were actively buying, especially in the money industry. For customer groups, the Tianjin group showed no intention, only the Yingkou group had some transactions. Therefore, near-term and long-term contracts were 0.01 or 0.015 yuan better than the previous day. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, due to the Tianjin group drawing on gun carriages for this month, the initial opening was quite good, as high as 0.0725 yuan. However, long-term contracts in various months suddenly saw a sharp drop, with floating longs close to manufacturers, making large sales. Small factories also followed suit. Therefore, from July onwards, prices gradually loosened and fell. According to the current situation, it is under the control of off-market traders, and it is impossible to talk about whether spot sales are active. The true market situation can only be judged after wheat accumulates and flour has no way out. As a result, this month was down by 0.005 yuan, July was down by 0.0125 yuan, August was down by 0.015 yuan, September was down by 0.0125 yuan, October was down by 0.01 yuan, and November was down by 0.0175 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Futures Wheat Market Brisk in the Morning, Weary in the Afternoon <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market saw a continued brisk trend in all months after opening in the morning. Due to foreign wheat quotations, Chicago was up by 0.25 cents, and Canada was up by as much as 0.2 yuan. When the opening price was set, although this month was a new wheat contract, the current arrivals from various routes are still scarce. Transport customers are arriving and leaving at any time. Exchange hedging is still inconvenient. Therefore, sentiment is quite tight, 0.06-0.07 yuan better than the previous day. As for long-term contracts in various months, July and August continued to be 0.03-0.04 yuan better, and the rest had small fluctuations. However, when the market opened and trading was very quiet in the afternoon, the flour market turned down, and sentiment also weakened. Long-term contracts in various months fell sharply. As a result, July was down by 0.02 yuan, August was down by 0.02 yuan, September was down by 0.02 yuan, and October and November were unchanged. Regarding the new wheat situation, arrivals have been gradually increasing in recent days, and the quality is also exceptionally high. Due to the brisk flour market recently, the opening price is still stable. The opening price for Nanjing new wheat is 2.822 yuan, and the price for Hankou wheat is 2.8 yuan, totaling 280 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Late Rice Sales Brisk, Market Firm <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Sources from various merchant groups are only about 20 (about 3,000 stones of goods). Late rice is still actively traded with Northern, Tianjin, and Weihai merchant groups. Sellers with stockpiles are taking the opportunity to release them. At the same time, factory goods, Bo Dao rice, are also being sold off in large quantities, with 1,500-1,600 bags in stock. Therefore, this market is even more lively, and sellers are becoming more and more excited. Until the close of the market, statistics show that goods from Hexia, Qingjiao, Songjiang, Sijing, Fengxian, Lianjiang, etc., have been completely sold out, with more than 2,000 bags, and prices have increased by more than 0.1 yuan. Secondly, Suting and other thick japonica rice have also been bought by the Northern merchant group for more than 500 bags. Although Changzhou, Nanhang, and other japonica rice have not seen much activity in stores, the market shape has been tightened, and prices have increased by 0.05 yuan. Duyang and Jianjian rice are still fixed due to limited sales channels, and the price of Yinyang yuan is only the same, without glory.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 23-24 boats arrived from Hexia. Early rice goods are still scarce. Sales of various goods in the market, white japonica high-quality materials are average, and medium and secondary materials are slightly active. The price of selected short white yuan rice continues to change. Yangdu, Buku, and Jianjian rice sales are average. The market shape of high-quality japonica rice is fixed, and the number of medium and secondary rice is tight by a few points. White yuan yuan is 0.1 yuan less, and Yangdu, Buku, and Jianjian rice have little fluctuation.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Customer Indica Rice Sales Weak, Price Down by 0.1 Yuan <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, customer indica rice continued to arrive in port. The appetite of local customers is weak, because it is near the Dragon Boat Festival, and all parties intend to temporarily suspend business. Therefore, the desire for a lively market and turnaround must wait until after the festival. Yesterday, the Japanese street sold more than 300 bags of machine oil and machine red rice. Although Min Province continued to do business, it was not as active as before. The city sold 1,188 bags of coarse rice such as Shashi and Hankou. Quanzhou merchant groups responded to 100 bags of machine red rice for entertainment. Other people asked less. Because customerization is sluggish, owners are seeking to sell, and prices have been reduced by 0.1 yuan.</p>

<p>(Many farmers in Jintan kiln-dry cocoons.) This year, the Jintan Model District, along with government offices and silk merchants, jointly invested in the construction of four new-style cocoon firms, using kiln-drying machines. The old cocoon firms throughout the county did not dare to weigh and purchase cocoons because they suppressed prices. On the second day after the start of weighing and purchasing, the four new cocoon firms were vandalized by farmers, leaving silkworm farmers with nowhere to sell their cocoons. They all used local methods to dry the cocoons themselves and transported them to neighboring counties for sale, or entrusted cocoon firms to kiln-dry them in small batches.</p>
<p>(Cocoon firms in Wuxi have already stopped weighing.) A total of 202 cocoon firms have opened in the four rural areas of Wuxi. Weighing and purchasing began many days ago, but cocoon prices are not high. Improved breed cocoons only fetch an average of 35 yuan. The cost of fresh cocoons and leaves for farmers this season is more than 50 yuan per 100 jin (mulberry leaves cost 3.3-3.4 yuan per dan). Because of losses, it is difficult to sell, and many dry them themselves. Cocoon firms have only collected 20-30 dan in a few days, and all stopped weighing early. A small number of cocoon firms in the southern countryside are still weighing and purchasing.</p>
<p>(Suzhou dry cocoons are continuously transported to Shanghai.) The spring cocoon market in various counties of Suzhou Province is gradually coming to an end. Dry cocoons from various cocoon firms are now being continuously transported to Shanghai. The dry cocoons from Yixing, Jintan, Changshu, Wuxi, and Jiangyin are mostly loaded onto barges and towed by small steamers to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Red and Green Tea Sales are Booming <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, major foreign firms such as British Trading Company, Jardine Matheson, Ewo, and Tongsfoo were heavily purchasing red tea from Qimen, Fuliang, Ningzhou, Wenzhou, and other places, as well as green tea from Tunxi, Shexian, Suian, and other places. Total transactions in red and green tea throughout the city reached six to seven thousand boxes. The briskness of the trading is unprecedented since the new tea came on the market. Regarding the forms of tea, coarse grades of red tea from Wenzhou and Hekou are still the most popular. Upper and middle grades of tea from Qimen and Ningzhou have also become firmer in the market. As for the destination of green tea, except for local grades of Pingshui, which are slightly sluggish, the rest are sold as soon as they arrive. Even the needle-shaped eyebrow green tea, which has been sluggish for a long time, has become more active in its sales.</p>

<h3 id="e254">Curiosity and the Chinese <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>丨Thoughts Inspired by the Haunting in Hua'an Fang丨</p>
<p>These past few days, a hot wind, mixed with "religious ceremonies" and "scientific spirit writing," has just blown over. A "strange event" has once again been "widely publicized" in the city. It is said that a vacant house in Hua'an Fang, Zhabei, is haunted by ghosts. It is said that "many people are gambling in the vacant house at night, and there are sounds of radio, conversations, and mahjong mixed together. But when the door is knocked and people rush in, there is not a single person inside." So, someone describes it with great animation, and someone listens in stunned silence. Someone else exaggerates it even more vividly, and yet another person listens with their hair standing on end... In this way, it spreads from one to two, and from two to three, all over the streets, shops, "consulates," and "offices." So, people sitting in tea houses talk about it with their legs crossed, shop assistants in foreign cloth stores talk about it leaning on the counters, and passengers on trams talk about it while looking at the red characters on the newspapers. As they talk, they are so excited that white foam appears at their mouths, thoroughly enjoying it. Finally, they conclude: "How strange! How strange!" So, they go to Hua'an Fang together, and suddenly the road where Hua'an Fang is located is filled with "cars like flowing water and horses like dragons."</p>
<p>Oh, how grand! Perhaps there are no people in the world who are as enthusiastic about "curiosity" as we Chinese! No, perhaps there are no people in the world whose "curiosity" is as "pure" as ours. Because other people's curiosity can often become the engine of "research" and "exploration," while our Chinese people's "curiosity" is purely about being "curious" and stops there, without any follow-up. If curiosity leads to various troubles, we Chinese people will definitely not get involved. For example, if Hua'an Fang is haunted, it will undoubtedly arouse a strong "curiosity" in our people. They will not hesitate to spend time spreading the word everywhere, and they will go to see it regardless of the distance. Even if they gain nothing, they will still feel that this is a "strange" event, but they will never investigate the reason for the "strangeness." If someone raises questions such as "Why are there ghosts?" and "What are ghosts?" their "curiosity" will immediately decrease. If someone else uses some scientific explanation to refute this "strange story," they will simply turn away, because that would be too "disappointing."</p>
<p>Even the so-called "scientific spirit writing," a few days ago, simply caused a "city-wide sensation." This is something that someone explained scientifically twenty years ago (Chen Daqi, Superstition and Psychology), but unexpectedly it is appearing again today. This is enough to prove how strong the "curiosity" of the Chinese people is. They do not want "truth" to expose the "strange events" they "love," but would rather have "strange events" obliterate all truth. What scientific explanations and psychological research are simply "eyesores" and "nonsense" in the minds of our "curious" Chinese people!</p>
<p>"Curiosity" seems to have a different meaning in China. Other people's "curiosity" can be maintained for a long time, while Chinese people only rely on temporary impulses. "Curiosity" often leads to careful research in others, while in China it is only a casual pastime. Let me give two examples:</p>
<p>A maid in the home of a certain British aristocrat fell ill one night. During her illness, she suddenly spoke in Greek. Everyone said she was possessed by a demon, because the maid had never learned Greek. When this news spread, many curious people came to visit, which aroused enthusiastic research by psychologists, doctors, detectives, etc. After five or six years, it was finally discovered that the woman had worked as a helper in the home of a linguistics professor, and the linguistics professor read Greek every night. This proved that although the maid had never studied Greek, her subconscious mind had learned it, and it was expressed when her consciousness was blurred and her subconscious mind took over.</p>
<p>If China encountered such a problem, I think it would definitely become an immortal "strange event" and never get such a rational explanation.</p>
<p>What is the "curiosity" of the Chinese people like? The following joke describes it best:</p>
<p>A person was walking down the street and suddenly thought of something. He leaned against a tree on the side of the road and looked up in contemplation. After</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>a while, he suddenly found that he was surrounded by a large circle of people, all looking up and staring. He was shocked and slipped out of the encirclement. When he walked far away, he looked back and saw that more and more people had gathered there, all looking up at the sky where he had been looking, as if searching for something.</p>
<p>Although this is a joke, it is true. Our people are often so idle and curious.</p>
<p>"Curiosity" is originally the driving force of invention, but it needs to go hand in hand with a "love of learning." Most of our people are simply "curious" and not "studious." Although some people say that idleness and curiosity are the demeanor of a great nation, I say that this "unstudious" "curiosity" is the most unprogressive bad habit of our nation!</p>
<h3 id="e255">Written After Reading "How to Control Women" <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Bu</p>
<p>After reading Hong Benjun's work, I feel some lingering thoughts. If it is said that women can be controlled, then why can't men be controlled? If everyone rises up to study the art of control in the future, and two sides are clearly formed in opposition, then what is there to say about love? Wouldn't life be even more mechanical? Moreover, in Hongjun's work, women are regarded as puppets. Perhaps Hongjun was momentarily stimulated and rashly wrote this grand article insulting women. Seeing injustice on the road, others are silent, and Xu Bu has no choice but to stand up and write a few words.</p>
<p>Originally, in today's society, there are too many people who do not understand love. Therefore, since the prevalence of free love, many real tragedies have occurred due to the general misunderstanding of love. Both men and women should be equally responsible for this. We should not doubt that all women are like this because of this, and we should not doubt that the true meaning of love is also like this, and say that the sanctity of love is nonsense. It's just that there are too many men and women in the world who despise love like Hongjun, so tragedies of using love to deceive and control people often occur. Perhaps in Hongjun's opinion, it is a ridiculous farce. Seeing love as a purely material matter and wanting to obtain it by tricks is Hongjun's big mistake. Although perhaps the general concept is as Hongjun said, how can it be said that the entire female world is like this!</p>
<p>In my opinion, the two sides of love should understand and care for each other. If it is said that because I love you, I restrict you, that is the biggest mistake in today's discussions about love; it is also a major reason for causing the other party's resentment. Therefore, I think it is better not to be in love before both sides fully understand the true meaning of love. Otherwise, the result will still be a tragedy, and needless to say, a happy family is forever hopeless.</p>
<p>Speaking of women, there are indeed many like Hongjun said, but there are also many who do not follow the crowd. Needless to say, most of the women in the countryside still have sincere love; and even among the women in the flashy city, there are many who are not as Hongjun said. For example, Hongjun said: Women like men to condescend to them, that's right! A portion of women do have this kind of thinking, but how many women will love you because you condescend to them? Isn't it just that men deliberately use their status to lure women? Such men cannot talk about love at all. But generally, pitiful women can indeed fall into the traps of men due to vanity. This is indeed a weakness of general women; but it is not a common weakness of the female world.</p>
<p>Third point: Hongjun said that men's psychology should not be understood by women. Once it is understood, she will attack you, force you, etc. Originally, such a union of men and women has no love in it at all, and there is no need to argue about it. But Hongjun's words do have some points that make people have to say something. These few sentences are not entirely without reason, but these kinds of words can only be said of general women who sell their smiles and have been trained to wink and flirt; and cannot criticize the entire female world.</p>
<p>Again, Hongjun said that women love money. As long as you have money, no matter what kind of man you are, she will stay with you overnight "play the clapper". From this, we can see that Hongjun has only encountered a kind of money-worshipping woman who sells her smiles. He has never seen a truly dignified woman. In Hongjun's view, women are simply playthings, things without souls. Here, he reveals the ugly true face of humanity; forgetting the position of the writer. There are many places that are completely scolding and cannot be described in detail. Only the above few examples can show that the women Hongjun is talking about are all harlots who sell their smiles. It is so boring and ridiculous to use harlots who sell their smiles to compare to the face of the female world.</p>
<p>Now, I have finished speaking. Finally, I advise Hongjun: Women are just like men, both good and bad are mixed together. You cannot criticize the entire female world based on one-sided observations. If you have not deeply observed the specific face, it is better to keep silent to save trouble.</p>

<p>— Wen Hei</p>
<p>When I first moved to this new residence, I was very satisfied and happy. The new house in the new alley was called a pavilion room, but it was a pavilion room separated from the front building by a bathroom. In terms of area, it was even larger than the previous front building, and in front of the window was the garden of a rich man's villa. The grass and trees in the garden were lush, and flowers protruded beyond the wall. There was also a hexagonal pavilion. Because the room was large, I lived with Qing, who were both writers. Our temperaments and habits were similar, and we were truly happy. Unexpectedly, one night, one of the people in the front building (who also lived with another man), when I was in bed reading a book and about to sleep, one of them opened the bathroom door and came into our room. I didn't know what he wanted to do and wanted to ask him, but he said to me first, "Did anyone pass through this bathroom at six o'clock last night?" This question was strange! He also said, "We went out to eat at six o'clock, and when we came back, a pair of Chinese silk pants were missing!" I remembered that it seemed that the landlord downstairs was taking a bath last night, and the landlord's wife passed through our room to deliver clothes, so I told him what I remembered. He said, "Someone was taking a bath, no wonder!" He said, returning to his room. Qing was already asleep and probably heard it. He said, "The window there leads to the outside stairwell, I'm afraid they went in through the window." I immediately remembered that the landlord took a bath the day before yesterday, and yesterday I went out in the afternoon and didn't come home until midnight. I didn't know anything, so wasn't what I just said accusing the landlord of theft? Feeling wrong, I lifted the covers from the bed and ran to the front building without even putting on my coat. I said to the man, "The landlord took a bath the day before yesterday, and I wasn't home yesterday and don't know anything." Looking up, I saw the student from the clothing shop downstairs standing there. I also remembered that the student often ran to open his room door during the day, so I told him about it. Turning around, I also told him that the bathroom window leads to the stairwell. The student and him were arguing, and I returned to our room. In bed, I remembered mentioning the student just now, wasn't that also accusing him? I immediately felt that my nerves were messed up tonight. At the same time, I also remembered that the man in the front building came over to me about this matter, wasn't he suspecting that we might have stolen something? Another layer of insulted anger was added to my spirit. I thought of Qing, my roommate... Could it be that he... I can't think about it.</p>
<p>From that night on, my spirit was being tortured.</p>
<p>A few days later, I came home from outside, and when I looked up at the black sign at the entrance of the alley, I saw a red piece of paper with a house for rent, "Front Building No. 2 for Rent." These six words were like a sharp blade stabbing into my heart! They are moving out, they are moving out! Oh my God, they suspect that I, a wanderer in this pavilion room, am a thief! This morning, I was washing my face in the bathroom, and the man in the front building said to me, "The landlord is going to return your room, right?" I said, "No!" He said, "We are moving today!" Oh my God, he has been suspecting me and hating me all along, and he has already told the landlord to return my room! And the landlord must also be suspecting that I, a wanderer, am a thief!</p>
<p>I can't live in this room anymore! Even if the landlord doesn't dismiss us, I can't stand the spiritual torture!</p>

<p>— Nan Ding</p>
<p>After three years of cohabitation, I have tasted enough of the taste of "love."</p>
<p>The so-called "happiness of love" is just an illusion.</p>
<p>Economic oppression and social crises have deeply broken into everyone's "territory."</p>
<p>In the beginning, when I began to enter the "love net," everything reflected in my eyes was lively, fresh, and harmonious. However, after three years of life, everything was the opposite of before. We often quarreled and fought over small things, like enemies, without the previous situation of mutual humility. In this way, the surroundings I came into contact with now seemed to have lost their freshness and harmonious existence in my eyes.</p>
<p>From these days on, we were both very clear about each other's actions. Due to inner sensitivity, when I sat down, I knew what she was going to say, and when I lay down, she understood what kind of words I was going to say.</p>
<p>She was tired of everything. She was often annoyed, and often quietly lay on the bed crying alone. Because she always liked me to stay at home and accompany her, but I couldn't do that. Is it that after a person becomes a "home," they have to become a tool, a decoration of the "home"? Or that a person becomes a "lover," becomes a "husband and wife," he or she must become his or her slave?</p>
<p>This is absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>"Marriage is the tomb of love," this sentence has its considerable value. I feel that the so-called "love" is a pastime for the leisure class, especially the pastime of the petty bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>After all, it is distressing, and thinking about it later, I felt even more pain.</p>
<p>So, I often quietly ran to the suburbs alone. In the open and fresh fields, I wandered on that vast land, admiring the green mountains and green waters, trees, flowers, flying birds and running animals, and the beauty of nature, bringing me into a secluded and pure realm. I couldn't help sighing at the good fortune of individual free life.</p>
<p>However, this temporary physical sense of ease, when I returned to my dull "home," was scattered by the east wind like a colorful cloud.</p>
<p>Life is a burden to me, and I understand that this is unavoidable. I am no longer a child of childhood.</p>
<p>Work is a mission to me, and I clearly understand that this is a necessary obligation for me to life; I am no longer just myself.</p>
<p>"I must change, I must change the form of my life!" As I stepped into the "home" door, looking at my wife, who was frowning and waiting for me to come home, I deeply sighed.</p>
<p>She glanced at me, which seemed to be blaming me for leaving her alone in this cold and empty house.</p>
<p>I ignored her and lazily lay on the bed. Looking at the ceiling, looking at this empty and dull little house, thinking about this life, I couldn't help but shudder and then silently thought:</p>
<p>"Love" is hatred to me!</p>
<p>"Life" is disgust to me!</p>
<p>However, I have to live, and she has to love. We are living and loving. Aren't people animals rich in emotion?</p>
<p>However, we are very distressed after all. In love of poverty and depression, aren't we struggling? After three years of love, I have tasted the bitterness of love. I have no love, I cannot love; I hate love! At this time, I feel that there is something more important, more urgent, and more meaningful than love.</p>

<p>In the past half month, drama has suddenly become active, which is naturally a very good phenomenon. Moreover, readers have enthusiastically written reviews. But to be honest, the editor is a layman in drama and does not know the situation of the performances. Of course, the value of the drama cannot be estimated in the organization of the text of the submitted drama reviews. Therefore, what is published here are all specially commissioned contributors of this newspaper. At the same time, the writers of theater reviews should bear some responsibility for the text. In the future, I hope that readers will not submit this kind of manuscript. Those who have attached sufficient postage have been returned. I apologize for not answering each inquiry letter individually.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Philosophical Exhaustion <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Wu</p>
<p>Innocent children will never think about the matter of life, and old people are unwilling to ask questions about life again: What exactly is it for? Only young people and adults, drilling into this stuffy gourd, try their best to get out. Sometimes they live quietly and peacefully, and sometimes they stir up and shout, "What exactly is life for?" At this time, it should be an extremely depressed moment.</p>
<p>When there are many times of depression, the depths of the heart will never be peaceful.</p>
<p>Moral views of life and religious views of life have long been unable to arouse their life force and cannot hold back their fantasies. They pray for a united life, and at the same time want to develop their own personal personality; they doubt this era and this society, but dare not be sure that they have the ability to transform; they eagerly seek to fulfill real life, and at the same time they recall and envy the past. In a word, they are not satisfied with their current life, but they don't know how to improve it.</p>
<p>For example, socialism is too cold, individualism is too laissez-faire; if the realistic view of life is adopted, life is fundamentally doubted; if the natural view of life is adopted, they are unwilling to be lonely: again, if the so-called true love view of life, and the truth view of life are adopted, then some of the slightest true love and truth cannot be found in this world.</p>
<p>They want everything, and at the same time they don't want anything. What they want is the past and the future, and what they don't want is only what belongs to the present. So, what do they have now?</p>
<p>Stirring, stirring, the depression is intensified, and the stuffy gourd of life still has not been broken from the inside. Finally, doubt, resentment, and disillusionment push people onto a path of decline.</p>
<p>A friend once said to me that if you want to know "what life is for," you only need to commit suicide, but where can these words be said?</p>
<p>Life, life, philosophy's explanation for modern youth has been exhausted and cannot be used at all.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Lawyers' Extra Income <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>"Living in Shanghai is not easy." This saying is most accurate, I think. However, this is certainly not a problem for those living in Western-style houses; but for the average small citizen, the working class, and salaried people, it is indeed a bit frightening! Because the expenditure on rent alone accounts for at least a third of a family's total expenses. Take myself, for example! Living in a small attic room with inconvenient transportation and poor air quality costs me seven dollars a month. Seven dollars is a third of my total monthly income. The remaining two-thirds must cover food, clothing, socializing, medicine, and all other miscellaneous items, so I am constantly broke.</p>
<p>Seven dollars a month, twelve months a year, adds up to eighty-four dollars. Eighty-four dollars could perhaps buy one or two acres of land in the countryside. However, in Shanghai, it can only rent a place the size of a tofu square; with a bed and a small table inside, there is no place to put anything else. Therefore, I often hate urban life and long to live in the countryside, but life tells me; it is impossible, impossible.</p>
<p>Not long ago, someone, seeing that rents were increasing daily and that the general public and shops would have unbearable burdens, and that the future of Shanghai was in decline, initiated a "Rent Reduction Movement Committee" to revive Shanghai's market and prosper the city's commerce. For a time, it rose like a storm, with voices echoing from front to back, and various districts and neighborhoods followed suit; seemingly, the wave of rent reduction</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>shook the entire Shanghai. However, it was only a flash in the pan. Nevertheless, this gave several big lawyers a large batch of extra business. Smart lawyers, of course, would not let this opportunity pass, and they printed a large number of warning letters and rent reminder letter formats; when needed, they only needed to fill in the names of the parties, the amount of rent, and the recipient, as it was all the same monotonous article.</p>
<p>The court also added an unknown number of civil lawsuits for rent arrears.</p>
<p>Originally, money can communicate with gods, and the landlords naturally wouldn't keep these ant-like tenants in mind.</p>
<p>Speaking of their countermeasures, there are no more than three methods: First, if the tenant insists on reducing the rent and refuses to pay without a reduction, then they simply don't come to collect it. After a considerable period, they request legal assistance to collect the owed rent, not fearing that you will be shortchanged by a single cent. The second is to use harsh measures of cutting off water and transportation to pressure the tenants. Both water and transportation are necessities that cannot be lacking for even a moment in daily life. By monopolizing the source of these two things, they are not afraid that you will not compromise with them. When the compromise is reached, they will have a victorious smile. The third is the last resort, selling or mortgaging the original property, allowing the new owner to declare renovation and force relocation. There are also a few unscrupulous landlords who even use the name of foreign merchants to oppress tenants.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in today's declining countryside, whole batches of villagers are dreaming of a golden city and flowing into the city, thus causing inevitable and uncoordinated conflicts in urban society's consumption and production. The investment eyes of the financial and banking sectors, however, avoid commercial and industrial enterprises and lean towards the real estate industry, causing Shanghai's market to develop in an unbalanced and deformed way. The increase in real estate prices and rents is an inevitable fact. Although, recently, due to the initiation of the Rent Reduction Movement, and further promoted by the Citizens' Federation, citizens in various districts and neighborhoods have continued to organize rent reduction branches, the rent reduction movement continues to make noise day by day. In the end, it still cannot alleviate the burden on the citizens by even a penny, and the disputes are expanding day by day, and the housing problem remains unsolved. Because the law will never help tenants because of the market downturn, rent arrears must of course be repaid, and if they are not, the door will inevitably be sealed.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Wound <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Wenlan</p>
<p>Born without a hometown.</p>
<p>All over the world, he wanders, ceaselessly and forever wandering, from here to there.</p>
<p>It was also by chance! He stayed with us.</p>
<p>Wearing a tattered coat obtained from who knows where, a bamboo pole always carried with him, barefoot, from as far back as he can remember, he recognizes that he has never changed. He has lived for more than twenty years, he has not accumulated a single penny, his life is one of shouting with his mouth every day. However, this mouth of his is not clever, because he knows too little about "speaking nicely." This not-so-clever mouth of his really makes him suffer, often not getting any rice or porridge, only receiving a cold face. When he meets a cranky person, he gets a scolding head-on. He endures all this. He is hungry and has no choice but to beg from door to door.</p>
<p>The psychology of wanting to improve once moved him, "Isn't he just a young man in his early twenties? He has strength and should find a proper life," but the following difficulty made him feel dull again. Where to go in today's declining industries? And who can accommodate him, a beggar?</p>
<p>Yet he lives, shouting with his mouth every day.</p>
<p>He is not as well-off as other beggars, he knows how much he hates this not-so-clever mouth!</p>
<p>At the corner of the alley, he frantically sings out-of-tune songs. Then, a group of children gather around, pointing at him and saying, "Crazy beggar."</p>
<p>When he feels intense pain, he sings, sobbing in the cold weather, the wind carrying such mournful and sorrowful tunes.</p>
<p>He wants to live, he has to live, but his means of seeking life are incompetent. Once, walking past a place full of people's clothes drying, this white cluster of clothes clearly shook his thoughts on how to seek life. Before his eyes, this opportunity, easy, profitable, and wonderful, could satisfy his desires for a few days. He hesitated, and finally pulled down a silk dress and turned to prepare to run. Suddenly, a person chased after him from that doorway, and vaguely he felt a door bolt as thick as a pillar strike him in the waist, "Thief! You thief!" such a stern shout.</p>
<p>Now, he will not come out to beg, never again come out to beg for the few leftovers exchanged for the endless beatings and scoldings of cruel humanity. He lies prostrate at the entrance of an ancient temple, on that loose pile of straw, caressing the wound he received for wanting to satisfy a little of life. He thinks of home, thinks of his mother, he weeps, not daring to cry aloud, he sobs softly.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Going to the City <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Rongxi</p>
<p>Dad is going to the city! Speaking of the city, Little Silly couldn't help but feel envious again!</p>
<p>He remembers that the city has four-wheeled cars, horse carriages, and revolving colored lights at the entrances of shops... there are so many things! Really, Little Silly wishes he could live there forever!</p>
<p>In the evening, Dad came home. Little Silly's eyes were fixed on Dad's face. Dad's face didn't have the usual smile, it was always gloomy! Iron-blue.</p>
<p>For the past two months, Dad hasn't gone to the factory, he has been pacing the streets every day. He also doesn't bring back tasty things in his hands when he comes home, like he used to. Little Silly would take them and put them in his little basket, Dad would stroke his black hair, and a gentle and loving smile would appear on his face. But now it's different! When Little Silly sees his father coming home, he will retreat a few steps in fear!</p>
<p>At this time, Mom stares at Dad, and Little Silly also stares at Dad. Dad always hangs his head, and the room is strangely desolate!</p>
<p>"How is it..."</p>
<p>Mom said, trembling.</p>
<p>Dad didn't make a sound, just shook his head.</p>
<p>Little Silly felt strange, Dad was really like a robber seeing an official, wasn't Dad always talking and laughing before?!</p>
<p>"Mom, who made Dad angry?"</p>
<p>Mom was like Dad, not making a sound. Mom's eyes were shining. Little Silly never got the answer to this mystery.</p>
<p>"When a person loses their job, all hope is really gone."</p>
<p>Mom sobbed.</p>
<p>Little Silly didn't believe that such a good person like Dad would have nothing to do! Dad doesn't go out to play with women, doesn't smoke, doesn't gamble. Really, he believes that Dad is a good person without any flaws! Mom's lips trembled again, still so trembling:</p>
<p>"Why don't we go to the city and borrow some from uncle." Little Silly was excited again when he heard about going to the city. Dad had said many times about going to the city, but it never happened. He looked at Dad suspiciously.</p>
<p>"There's no way, Mom, it's so hard to find a job through someone! I'm afraid borrowing will be in vain..."</p>
<p>Dad was obviously angry, and Little Silly became a little scared. However, hope finally overcame fear. He asked:</p>
<p>"Mom, Mom, I want to go."</p>
<p>Mom didn't express anything, Mom only said faintly:</p>
<p>"Mom isn't going, you shouldn't go either."</p>
<p>After a pause, Mom continued:</p>
<p>"Dad doesn't have much money now, we'll take you when he has a job later."</p>
<p>Little Silly's enthusiasm suddenly disappeared. Only a trace of fear remained! Looking at Dad's iron-blue face, he didn't have the courage to say he wanted to go again.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, Little Silly got up. Dad ate a few Henan pancakes, put them in the bag on his back, and was about to leave when Mom said:</p>
<p>"Tell him about our hardships."</p>
<p>Dad nodded, put on his broken felt hat and left. "Mom, is Dad going to borrow money from uncle?"</p>
<p>Mom's hardworking hand stroked Little Silly's hair, Little Silly felt all kinds of tenderness, Mom stared blankly at Dad's back, tears falling down, Mom was stunned.</p>
<p>Travel Notes</p>
<h3 id="e264">Impressions of Chang'an (5) <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Yunshan</p>
<p>8. Southerners in Chang'an</p>
<p>"Go to the Northwest!"</p>
<p>The loudness and novelty of this call were no less than the revolutionary fervor of "Go to the People!" and "Go to the Countryside!" during the Northern Expedition era.</p>
<p>I really went to the "Northwest." And I saw many southerners who had already arrived and were "living and working in peace!" Among them, naturally, there are many small industrialists and merchants who have lived here for a long time and have almost assimilated with the local area. There are also many who have become noble due to political changes.</p>
<p>Occasionally passing through the streets and alleys, hearing a few soft Wu dialects, I, a lonely traveler in this foreign land, really felt the joy of "meeting an old acquaintance in a foreign land!" But upon closer inspection: no way! People have such a luxurious and dignified air, how can you, this little nobody, squeeze in? In the end, I still felt ashamed of myself, spat, and walked away!</p>
<p>Horseback riding in the suburbs should have a special flavor around this ancient city, but I didn't have the opportunity to really experience it. During this time of the Yangchun March, when the scenery in the north is still good, every time in the slanting sunset, I see two or three young girls, 丨丨 of course also from the south! Lightly dressed and lightly made up, flaunting on tall steeds. Using a Chengyu from the Liaozhai: "Passersby looked back and followed them with their eyes." Afterwards, there are always a few unimportant idle comments:</p>
<p>"Our southern women are still beautiful! Look: how beautiful she is riding on a horse!" The southerners who opened small shops evoked memories of the spring scenery of Jiangnan.</p>
<p>"Rare? That's just the old trick of 'the wife gains glory from the husband's success!'" Another merchant said angrily:</p>
<p>"I don't know whose concubine this is? Their good fortune is so great...!" The coolies on the road sighed to themselves that they were not as good!</p>
<p>9. The Important People Inspecting the Northwest</p>
<p>The important people's inspection of the Northwest is either for the construction of the accompanying capital, or for the development of the countryside; or perhaps due to the emotion of drinking water and thinking of the source, they specially ran back to their "old home" to visit the graves. (The Northwest is the old home of the Han people in history.)</p>
<p>Regarding the construction of the accompanying capital, I saw that there was already a wooden sign for the "Preparatory Committee of Western Capital," and I don't know how long it had been established. Regarding returning to the "old home" to visit the graves, there are many examples, too numerous to list. Only the construction of rural development, because the project of the Tongxi section of the Longhai Railway has already been concretely carried out, does indeed show some new atmosphere.</p>
<p>First, the landlords of Chang'an have built countless earthen enclosures on the abandoned wasteland inside and outside the city to show where the sovereignty lies. Their greatest hope is that after the railway is opened, land prices will rise and they can make a fortune!</p>
<p>Second, the hotel industry is booming, and a magnificent building has been newly built across from the Xijing Hotel on Dongda Street. In the future, its business will be more developed than the current Northwest Hotel.</p>
<p>Third, the Yuqin Textile Company, which is preparing in Sanyuan, and the National Northwest College of Agriculture and Forestry, which is being built in Wugong, are closely related to the livelihood of the Northwest people.</p>
<p>Fourth, the power of the great powers will, with the development of inland transportation in China, penetrate deeper into the bottom layer of the rural Northwest, reaching everywhere!</p>
<p>In short, "The Dao is one foot high, and the Devil is ten feet high!" Everything is relative. To develop the Northwest, internally, we must pay attention to the actual benefits to the common people. Externally, we must prevent the disasters that the great powers will bring in the future.</p>
<p>"Beware of peeling and plundering!" I would like to give these four words to those who are truly responsible! 丨丨丨End丨丨丨</p>
