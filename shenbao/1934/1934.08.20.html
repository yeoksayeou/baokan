<p>自從美國宣布白銀國有政策以來。不但在美國的通貨制度上起了一番重大的變化。就是在世界的生銀市塲以及銀本位國家的貨幣價值上。也跟着發生了相當嚴重的影響。關於前一點。本報前已略有陳述。現在僅就後一點再行説明一下。　　美銀國有政策對於世界生銀市塲最大的影響。在於恢復倫敦在世界生銀市塲中的中心地位。我們只須檢視最近幾天倫敦的生銀市况和生銀移動情形。便能完全證明這點的關鍵。其次便是對於中國的影響。因爲中國是目前的主要用銀國家。　　據近來情形觀察。美國政策對於中國的影響。可以從中國存銀的移動狀態中明白的看出來。因爲美國政策旣能使海外銀價常高於上海銀元的匯價。中國存銀自然隨時有外溢的可能。外溢的結果。將在中國商業信用方面發生緊縮的作用。其故因銀行的發行和存欵。都靠現銀作準備的。如果現銀存底日形薄弱。銀行爲着充實力量起見。便只有採取信用緊縮的營業方針。由内地吸收現金。以彌補存底日薄的趨勢。保况中國在貿易上常處於入超的地位。以上海一埠而論。目前入超每月卽達二千萬元以上。平時這筆消耗。大半靠着外人投資的增加和信用來週轉的。一旦外國銀行喪失了對於華商的信用。或停止投資的活動。便會迫着使華商方面不能不提取現銀或搬運庫存了。這又是足以激起華商銀行實行緊縮方針的一個很重要的原因。如此説來。中國存銀的淨輸出。如果過度的發展了。對於國内商業信用所起的緊縮作用。實在是無可避免的。　　究竟美國政策施行以後。中國存銀是否會有大量輸出的可能呢。這就目前説。第一要看美國的購銀政策如何繼續進行。第二要看中國當局所採取的方針如何。第三還要看遠東方面的備戰形勢如何。照我們觀察。存銀的大量出口。固然要使中外雙方同受其害。而禁銀出口。也不見得是對症的良方。此中理由。是很顯然的。卽如本年一月份以來。現銀淨出口的已逾七千萬元。其中七八兩月間的凈出口。卽佔去四千萬元以上。如果這種現象再行（變本加厲。）勢必動摇信用。以至發生更進一步的緊縮恐慌。到那時候。中國的國民經濟。固將更加枯竭。就是外人的利益。恐怕也要受相當的打擊罷。但反過來説。如中國當局宣布禁銀出口。是否立卽可以收到相當的效力呢。誰都知道。中國存銀雖足。但大半握於一般人民之手。卽如上海華洋庫存。中外各有其半。其數量不過六萬萬元。政府宣布禁銀出口。不但不易實行。實行亦極難收到效力。因爲一則偷運之事。不易防止。二則禁銀出口之後。外匯日高。進口貨物如軍械之類。將有價值騰貴之勢。財政上的困難是不可免的。三則外人在華投資。也將因此而貶價。他們的阻力。不可輕視。這些都是禁銀出口時的困難。　　照上面説來。過度的現銀出口。固然足以妨害中外商業。禁銀出口。也有許多困難。而不易爲當局所採用。我們認爲政府當局如能及早説明並無禁銀出口之意。則外間之謡言自息。人心就可安定。現銀出口。亦自然可望减少了。廢止海軍條約問題</p>

<p>在霞關官邸舉行重大會商　　以海軍軍縮爲討論之中心日本爲應付外交的變局、在一九三六年華盛頓·倫敦·海軍條約滿期以前、須籌備適當的對策、尤其是本年十月海軍軍縮預備會開會之前、她要準備週全、於是他借刷新外交之名、由外長廣田出面召駐歐美各重要國大使回國聽訓、同時卽籌議應變的策略、現在已經回到東京的有駐美大便齋藤博、駐法大使佐藤春夫、駐意大使松島肇、駐僞滿大使館參贊谷正之等、廣田於九日午後七時、在霞關官邸、召集以上各外交官、并由次長重光葵、及新任調查處長栗原正、（前天津總領事）、及外部各局長各處長列席會談、雖然這不算是正式會議、而實際關係却非常重大、因爲岡田内閣的成立、其主要工作是注重外交、而外交策略中、又以衝破日本現時國際的孤立爲第一任務、所以外交部這種會談、意義是特别不可輕視、會議的初步、首先由駐美大使齋藤報告美國的情勢、特别是美國對海軍軍備縮小的主張、及（道義外交一在美國一般社會與外交界所得的成效、其次是駐法大使佐藤報告歐洲的情形、尤其是法國對海軍問題的見解、谷正之則陳述其改組在（滿）機關的提案、具體的結果如何、現在還不曾探聽得十分明白、這一個會談的本身、雖不是决定最高策略的機關、但是這些人在外交技術上確是居於最高幹部的、他們的意見、也足以左右日本的整個外交策略、足以影響遠東的國際關係、　　雖然他們没有什麽具體决案、但有兩種很重要的計劃、第一是對海軍軍備縮小會議、堅持日本的軍備平等主張、打破以往的比率主義、其進行的步驟、首先是擴大日本對外宣傳、説他明并没有鎖閉遠東門户的野心、和奪取菲利濱一類的企圖、這事情在廣田·赫爾交換文書時已收到了相當的成效、而四月十七天羽聲明、又引起了很大的疑雲、所以現在又要重新作起、最具體的事實表現是增加對外宣傳經費、其數約計九百萬圓日金、要在美國特設情報局、同時還要在紐約和巴黎設立專門的圖書館、其宣傳材料完全由日本供給、第二是趕速設法拉攏美國、因爲日美之間對立還不十分嚴重、而生絲消塲又全部在美、借此可以打破英美的聨合、一旦對蘇發生事變、又可以取得物資上及國際政治上的支援、　　其次是在（滿）機關的改革案了、原來日本之於傀儡組織、是實行其所謂三位一體制、而關東司令官·又兼關東州長官·和駐（滿）大使、在事實上關東州長官底下的官僚與大使館的屬吏、與陸軍方面的中間層幹部、常常是互相對立、各不相下、弄得這位司令官也成了傀儡、加以關東軍司令部底下、陸軍方面各派系的暗鬭又很激烈、例如參謀長和副參謀長就各有不同的意見、所以現在的日本軍國主義已不似從前那樣堅固、那樣統一了、　　外部方面的意見、要把現時對（滿）的三位一體制、改作陸軍·外交·兩位一體制、從前（滿鐵）所屬的特殊事業、由外長指揮監督的、今後改歸内閣總理直接監督、關東州長官改爲關東州知事、撤回拓務部的權力、全權大使改爲純粹的外交官、不兼管治外法權等司法事項、并將治外法權名義交還傀儡國、但是全權大使仍由軍司令官兼攝、以求軍政外交的統一、這是外交方面的主張、在拓務部則以爲不應該廢止關東州長官、可是在陸軍還是嫌事權不專一、主張要設一元的統制機關、由軍司令官完全辦理、集軍政·外交·經濟等等於一個最高機關、纔能順序進行一切、纔能收統制的效果、總之日本的外交所採取的是積極政策、雖然内部不調和、但對外却很一致、并且也很毒辣、不知道他的近隣、受害最深的、該何如去對付、（八月十四日於東京）</p>

<p>該屋全部之配置、二層前樓爲堆置麥粉原料之所、三層前樓爲女工裝瓶包瓶工作部份、後樓爲廠主章靜初髮妻黄氏所住、樓下則闢爲發行所、其主要部份之汽鍋、則裝置於灶披間内、二樓亭子間則爲汽管部份、而管理汽鍋汽管者、則係一年逾五旬混名老頭白所主持、至該廠工作時間、爲每日上午六時至下午六時、如遇工作緊張時、亦常特開夜工、</p>

<p>慘劇發生後、該管盧家灣總捕房聞訊、立派大批探捕趕到、維持秩序、一面通知救火會全部出動、救火員趕到後、一面竭力撲火、一面設法救人、立時扒出二十餘人、一種斷頭折足、焦頭爛額慘狀、令人不忍卒睹、當時東自馬浪路西至石暉港一段、交通完全斷絶、各種車輛、均須繞道而行、</p>

<p>事後捕房推測肇禍之起因、一因汽鍋熱度太猛、一係管理斯職之老頭白缺乏經騐、加之配置原料、大多利用鏹水、而汽鍋旁復堆置多量之戤司林、故一旦氣管發生漏動射水麥料室中、於是熱氣上升、待汽鍋爆炸之後鏹水燃料一齊着火俱發、遂致不可收拾矣、至於已死之廠主章靜初、尚有子女五人、卽同住對面三星坊一號、除長子在某洋行辦事外、餘均幼稚、尚在求學、劉崇武案中牽涉之</p>

<p>——答談學若君——　　一，一個聲明　　首先，我們要向讀者交代明白的，是這裏所要談到的章回體小説，乃是牠的表式而不是牠的内容。本來，形式是由内容决定的，我們批評章回體小説，必然是要着重那千篇一律的神怪，俠義以及佳人才子的風流韻事等内容的解剖，不過，這是一件非常煩難的工作，非短短的篇幅所能説完的、且談君之意也不在此，於是便只有暫時略而不談了。　　二，章回體有什麽不好　　談君問：（章回體小説有什麽不好，章回體小説描寫風景人物的地方，甚至比現在的小説更生動動人）。　　我們的回答是；（在形式上，章回體小説，也正和它的内容一般，是有極大的缺陷的，那就是——　　第一，章回體小説的結局，總是團圓的，總是使人讀到一半便不須再讀已知道下半部寫的是什麽。寫俠義的時候，一定是有一個忠臣遭過着奸臣的陷害，於是俠義之士把他救了出來，結果忠臣加官進爵。寫佳人才子的時候，也一定是紅顔薄命，不是家庭突遭變故，就是有一個有錢有勢的花花公子，偶然看中了那佳人，於是千謀百計弄到雙方家破人亡，但結果才子佳人終於是有情人成了眷屬。這種佈局，有一個不變的定型，等於小孩子臨紅字模本，根本失掉了藝的創造性。　　第二，章回體小説是没有嚴密的結構的。一部幾十萬言的長篇，只是些不連續的事件勉强凑合起來的；你旣可抽出其中無論那一章那一回，成功一個獨立的短故事，且也無損於長篇的本身。作者寫一篇章回小説時，旣無須對題村加以選擇加以剪裁，只要憑自己的幻想有一點寫一點就够了，所以，凡是章回體小説如火燒紅蓮寺七俠五義統可無限制地無條件地續下去。這是一種織補，一種胡凑，而不能算是創作。創作是有中心思想的，故事的發展是有頂點的。長篇創作旣不是許多短篇的凑合，短篇小説也並不是長篇的縮短。　　第三，是章回體小説中的人物，描寫，不是活躍躍的人物，而是死的，神化了的人物。强盜就是（粗眉怒眼），才子就是（眉清目秀）；彭公案内的彭公與施公案内的施公、中完全一模一樣的，十美圖内的十個美人，其美的程度也看不出有不同之處。人常説，（人心之不同，各如其面），我們從來就不曾看到有兩個絶對相似的人物，但章回體小説的作者，却和戲班子做戲一樣，把世間奸臣善士才子佳人預先分别彫塑好了固定的臉譜、這豈不是滑稽！而且章回體小説在出現某一人物的時候總是加上一大套叙述，把人物的面貌性格統統先説出來，而不是從故事的開展中去表現，小説中的人物，即是生活在現社會的人物的形象化，如果有人跑到你跟前，把他自己的性情，出身，面目，一股腦告訴給你聽，試問、這該是多麽乏味）！　　然而，談君會認爲這種描寫動人。要怎麽解釋呢？這是因爲：一，這種描寫，容易使一般人領會，不必深思，一看就明白是怎樣一個人，怎麽一回事，二，這種描寫，一貫的是善於誇大，寫一個佳人，就一定寫成天仙，這樣，容易在直覓式感覺遲鈍的人的腦内刻下一個烙印，三，這種描寫，最易集中讀者的注意力，譬如寫武松打虎，便專一寫武松，把其它的人都一槪抹殺了。總之，章回體小説，無論在内容和形式，均能迎合一般社會民衆的低級趣味，但迎合低級趣味絶不是好的作品，如果談對再能多讀些新文學作品，定能明白章回體小説單在形式上是如何缺乏藝術性。　　三，章回體小説可不可以裝進新的内容　　談君又問：（如果用章回體來描寫新的社會生活是不是可以成功一篇好的作品）？　　我們的回答，是：（不可能的）；因爲形式畢竟次定於内容，，雖然有人在提倡舊形式的利用，但那必須是在新的形式還没有創造出來，而舊形式還是最適合表現那新内容的時候。如今，新的小説形式已經獲得了廣大的讀者層，章回體又不適宜於表達新的社會生活，我們爲什麽要用章回體來寫小説呢？　　目前的社會，是非常複雜的社會，目前的時代是一個悲劇的時代，我們旣不能把綜錯的生活鑄成一個模型，我們更不能把艱苦的人類鬥爭結成一個大團圓的圈套。我們小説中的人物是活躍的，不是死板的，我們小説中的背景，是變幻的，不是靜止的。那末，章回體與我們的創作有什麽關聨？如果硬要把新的内容裝進去，其結果，也只有使内容腐化，弄成非驢非馬的四不相而已。</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>介紹小西天　　編者</p>
<p>現在一般作家，都高喊口號，到民間去。是的，我們很贊成作家到民間去。替民間寫些東西出來。但是我們仔細考察一下，到民間去的作家，能有幾人，甚至於口裏喊着到民間去，人却在高大的洋房子裏。而咖啡館，跑狗塲，百樂門跳舞廳，大光明電影院……這是他們不時光顧的所在，也許這裏就是民間。</p>
<p>上面所説，是誰也不能否認的事實，所以縱然不斷的有民間文藝出現，眞正寫出民間情形來的文字，不能説絶無，却實在很少。我們旣希望有寫民間的文字出現，就不能不鼓勵作家到民間去。而張恨水先生就是鼓勵的一個。</p>
<p>張先生這次遊歷西北，在陜甘勾留約有三個月。在那與物質文明隔絶的所在，住窰洞，喝呢湯，没法的和老百姓接近，於是感覺到這西北的民間，却是中國的另一世界。在這一個世界裏，他發現到東方人士所認爲極平凡的生活，而那裏有人，已認爲是天上。東方人士所不願一朝居的地方，那裏也有人願終老於斯鄉。他看到這一種矛盾的事實，是絶好的小説材料，於是就利用了這材料，搆成一部長篇，名呌小西天。</p>
<p>這部小説，要緊接着東北四連長登下去。至於張先生的作品，讀者自然認識，用不着我們誇張。而我們所敢介紹的，這部小西天，决不是閉門造車的東西，乃是一部實實在在的西北民間小説。</p>
<h3 id="c213">老潘的人生哲學 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 季誠性</p>
<p>老潘是一個短短的胖子，一身横肉，滿腹滑稽，每每令人噴飯。他能使理壯氣直的一變而爲詞窮理屈了。弄得你呌苦不得，於是任何人不敢輕易與他接談。</p>
<p>他善於交際，又善於隨機應變，比如對方學過拳術的，他也會舞起兩隻笨手裝裝門面，比如對方學過醫藥的，他也會信口開河的説：傷風應用什麽藥，傷寒應用什麽藥。卽使中西大夫們都覺得凶多吉少的肺結核，在他也似乎不難解决，而且説出不難解决的理由。</p>
<p>他的目光炯炯如炬，能洞察對方的品性，行爲，思想………一個相處多年的朋友尚未瞧穿的秘密，在他只要化了三四個鐘頭，就够了。</p>
<p>許多未踏進社會的青年人，對他無不五體投地，於是常去請教他做人的法門，他自然接受來者之問，授法與人。把它總括起來，可分以下兩條：（一）推己及人，討人歡喜。（二）摸到對方心理，再施吹牛拍馬。問他再有其他法門没有，那麽他很快的回答：（够了，够了！）</p>
<p>他時常對人説這個故事：</p>
<p>（有一個人愛吃螺絲，慈善家勸他不要吃，因爲吃一次，要弄死無數小生命的。它們都要到玉皇大帝面前告發去，你到陰間時要受活罪的！他並不反對，慈善家含着勝利的微笑走開了。不久，他買了四擔螺絲，三擔放生，一擔自吃。他的理由是：在玉皇大帝前讚美我的有三擔螺絲，在咒詛的却只有一擔了）</p>
<p>老潘現在飛黄騰達了。可是他的這部人生哲學却是非常艱深難懂的啊！</p>
<h3 id="c214">點滴 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>

<p>鄧鐵梅將軍陷在瀋陽監獄中，敵人以酒筵相餉，他拒絶不食，誓之以死。因此想到當年張睢陽對南寄雲説：一南八，男兒死耳，不可爲不義屈一！眞可後先輝映。翹首東北，敬向鄧將軍頂禮膜拜。</p>
<h3 id="c215">一上一下 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 丁父</p>
<p>上海的房子種類很多；一上一下是其中之一。</p>
<p>一上一下看看是没有多少間。但是，如果碰到精明的二房東的時候，於是，一間變二間，二間變四間。假使二房東不會這樣的分，呌他如何從這裏拿錢，養家。</p>
<p>老式些的一上一下大抵有這幾間：客堂，客堂樓，亭子間，灶披間。此外還有一個天井，一個晒台。</p>
<p>客堂可分爲客堂背後同客堂，客堂背後還可以搭擱，灶披可一隔爲二……如此分起來，一上一下就可以住上二上二下，三上三下那麽多的人。</p>
<p>這些一上一下中的小房間，不是（白相人）的藏嬌所，就是（文學家）的住宅；不是抓拉的寗波先生，就是（來㖸）（來㖸）的江北同志。總之，一上一下的住客都是了不得的人物。</p>
<p>做一上一下的二房東雖然可以賺錢，但是也要一點本領，房客付不出錢，應當如何辦法，此外又要能够轉風使舵。</p>
<p>此外一上一下還能替救火會加點生意。</p>
<p>最後讓我來喊一聲：</p>
<p>（一上一下萬歲！）</p>
<h3 id="c216">御香縹緲錄 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>照我們預定的行程，太后將在車抵豐台之後，進伊第一次的車上的晚餐。晚餐過後，略事休息，便直駛天津，希望在太后準備安寢之前，能够到達天津。因爲依内務大臣慶善的主意，像太后這樣尊貴的人，殊不宜寄宿於任何一處村鎭，雖然在事實上，太后本不下車，車子不論是停靠在村鎭裏，或大都市中，原没有什麽分别，但慶善總以爲這是很不妥當的。</p>
<p>我們的列車任是開得怎樣的慢，豐台終於是到了！而我們的晚膳，也在同時端整下了。平常的時候，火車從北京到豐台，至多也不過三四十分鐘，我們却足足行了兩個鐘點以上，眞可説是打破了全世界的火車的最底速率。但是對於太后，憑它走兩個鐘點也罷，走兩天工夫也罷，反正有的是時間，今天過了，還有明天，明天過了，還有後天，大後天……，伊簡直從不曾想過時間有多少價值；而且伊自己到了車上，整個的政府，便等於帶了來了，一切軍國大計，同樣可以裁决施行，因此，伊就越發的不注意時間了！</p>
<p>因爲伊不知道寳貴伊自己所有的時間，於是伊對於别人和時間的關係，也是十分的漠視。單説我們這一次上奉天去，火車行駛的遲速，似乎單是影響了太后自己或我們，其實却影響了無數的人。譬如你那個時候凑巧要從天津到北平，或從天津到錦州，在尋常時候，是只要有錢買票，你就不難頃刻卽達；但在這時候，適逢皇太后的御用列車正在鐵軌上大踱其方步的當兒，你就倒霉了，無論你有多少錢，或有怎樣重大緊急的事故，都不用想搭什麽火車！好在你有的是時間，儘等着吧！一天，兩天，三天，……這樣老等下去，總有一天會放你過去的。也許你這個人的忍耐工夫太淺，等不到太后的專車到奉天，你已經生生的急死了，那還不是自尋煩惱嗎？</p>

<p>— 覺</p>
<p>苗人於鳥槍之外，又以有打石一技，其技亦童而習之，蓋兒童無事，羣聚指某樹某枝打之，中者爲能，故送石捷而有力，能於數十丈外，取空中飛鳥，凡與人接鬭之時，設子藥已盡，即拾石擊人，其傷亦重也。</p>
<p>苗人所謂打寃家者，先邀親朋數十百偕至，告以故，飲食畢，即許以捐軀,謂之帮兵，兩兵相望，先放火槍，苗婦隨後，接槍注藥，放槍後，各舞長桿槍以進，不勝則更拔短刀相接，又不勝，則匕首紐抱相截，官兵遇之，婉轉勸解始散，其被傷死者，即行掩埋，不以告官，官知而往騐，亦不告以葬所，兩家戰鬭之後，計屍以相抵，除一命一抵外，多屍者爲人命，則索牛馬財物以償，謂之倒骨價，其價則視兇手之貧富以爲差，富者目三百三十兩至五十五兩止，貧者從四十四兩减至二十二兩止，其中老牛瘦馬破衣舊物，俱可抵算，緣苗人重財物，輕性命，其主盟之人曰背箭，調和之人曰牙郎，又曰行人，官廳不依苗俗，必欲抵償，則殺一人，必添一仇，死者之子若孫，植樹墓旁，以記其恨，轉相仇殺滋蔓無已，故有毋苗仇，世不休之諺云。</p>
<p>苗人遇水旱疾疫，亦知卜筮，曰抛木卦，剖木爲二，擲之於地，祝其仰覆向背，曰釣梳卦，以綫懸梳，視其所向，曰雞蛋卦，以雞蛋置器中，向日咒之、咒畢卵定，以煤塗誌其左右，熟而分以綫，視黄白之厚薄，曰着雞卦，持雞於野，揷五色紙旗於地，燒以楮錢，擊竹筒禱之，然後烹雞，取兩脛，以竹筳測骨孔之淺深，其吉凶休咎，率卜於是數者也。</p>
<p>苗人信鬼，故以信鬼爲重事，或一年一次，或三年一次，費至百金，或數十金，貧無力者，賣産質衣爲之，故至十月十一月，農事畢後，即大做鬼事，有做米鬼做雷鬼做總鬼，種種名目，而苗人疾病，必曰有鬼，延巫祈禱，釀酒割牲，約親鄰飲福，此亦做鬼之一種，旣祭不愈、則委之於命，祭後揷標於門，若不知而誤入其門，謂驚其鬼，必償其所費，復祭如前而後已也。</p>
<p>苗人於五月逢子寅午日，則祭祖先，先日將牛馬難犬諸畜，用木關其足，使不能飛走，置之幽僻之所，旣祭，舉家老幼，避入山洞，名曰躱鬼，是日不舉火，不飲食，道路相值不偶語，盜賊刦竊不問訊，夜臥不敢轉側，蚊嘬不敢相觸，懼爲鬼覺云。</p>
<p>小暑節前，辰已兩日爲禁日，祀天王，或呼天王曰白帝天王，禁屠沽，止釣獵，不衣赤，不作樂，開禁獻牲後，方如常日。</p>
<p>苗人偶遇寃，忿不能白者，必告諸天王廟，設誓刺猫血滴酒中，飲以盟心，調之吃血，旣三日，必宰牲酬愿，謂之悔罪做鬼，其入廟則膝行股栗，莫敢仰視，理屈者，逡巡不敢飲，悔罪而罷其誓，蓋事無大小，吃血後，則必無悔，官廳於苗民訟案，不能直者，命以吃血則懼，蓋苗人畏鬼，甚於法也。</p>
<p>苗人不重人道，野合弗禁，婚娶簡便，稍有貲財者，輒娶數婦，故滋息極易，而在前朝，屢經撻伐，草薙禽獮，而山洞遺種，不數十年，又復遍滿林谷，號之曰苗，或即易生之義歟？（完）</p>

<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>製訂全國醫院標準以改進不良醫院國内醫院有屬於公立者。有屬於私立者。亦有屬於教會立者。其間等類萬殊。良莠不一。公立之中。有國·省·縣之别焉。私立與教會立之中。有中外之别焉。至一究其内容。則私人診所而名爲醫院者有之。以傳教爲目的。而以醫院爲手段者有之。於是設備不全。診治不力。誤人之事。遂時有所聞矣。間嘗深考其故。然後知醫院之良莠不齊。由於國家對於全國醫院之設立。無一定之標準。旣無標準可言。則野心之投機家。自得遂其所欲。是望政府從速製訂全國醫院標準。頒布施行。其有不符標準者皆限令改良。或嚴加取締。如是則害馬除而良驥出。亂苗去而嘉禾生矣。</p>
<p>（己）限制舊醫之産生以謀醫政之統一　夫醫無中外之分。惟有科學與非科學之别。中國新醫之名稱。亦以對舊醫言之也。舊醫爲科學之大敵。旣夫人知之。獨政府對於新醫雖知提倡。而對於舊醫則猶予保存。此種新舊并容之態度。適足造成其政令之分歧。此中國政局之所以永難統一也。或謂舊醫人數綦衆。若果一旦予以廢除。則將增加失業之人數。其實此種現象。殊易補救。補救之法。卽爲一方調查現在舊董開業之人數。使之一一登記。允其卽身開業。而禁其開門授徒。如是則已開業之舊醫。必日漸其减少。以至於絶無。而政府醫政之施行。亦自彌分歧之跡象。而漸趨於統一也。是在政府之速爲之而已。</p>
<p>（庚）廣設省立縣立鄉立之合於標準之醫院　今之言民生者。每謂貧民無解决疾病之能力。而歸其咎於醫師診金之太高。其實貧病問題。决非少數開業醫師所能解决。其責當由政府負之。惟一之方法。厥爲廣設醫院而已。國内醫院。除私立外立者外。國立者寥寥無綫。以致貧苦者無治病之地。吾甚望政府廣設合於標準之醫院於各省各縣各鄉各鎭。專爲貧病免費之治療。蓋醫院醫師與診所醫師不同。診所醫師每日所診者平均僅一二十人。而醫院每一醫師。嘗診治至百人左右。診所醫師爲生活計自不得不取相當之診金。而醫院性質。則純粹公益與慈善。對於貧病。自可一概免費。施惠普而收效宏。善莫大於此矣。</p>
<p>（辛）限制外籍醫師之開業以保存華醫之利權　吾國以積弱之故。對於外人之一切侵略。皆無過問之權。外籍醫師之來華開業。其一也。嘗考歐西各國。對於外籍醫師之開業。限制甚嚴。非經嚴格之考試。實地之調查。不能允許。良以政府負保障人民職業之責任。本國人民之利權。决不能爲外來勢力所侵奪。固不獨醫師一項而已。吾國向抱門户開放主義。而人民之拜外心理尤深。凡屬舶來。政府旣從不加以限制。人民且特别加以歡迎。於是外籍醫師遂駸駸有奪我華醫之勢矣。吾人苟一究外籍醫師來華之内容。則多爲在本國無地位或非正式之醫生。彼挾其本國之勢力。而以吾國爲其惟一之侵略目的。及至來華以後。一方則擴大其宣傳以博華人之信仰。一方則施其詆毁吾國新醫界之手段。以思權利之獨吞。故論其學識。則多簡陋異常。論其心術。則又貪狠無比。非我族類。而以民命託之。此其爲害。又豈獨鯨吞我新醫師之利權而已。是望政府從速製訂限制外籍醫師開業之明文。凡外藉醫師之來華者。皆須加以嚴格之考試與精密之調查。且必需其精通華語。如是則人民之生命。華醫之利權。庶幾有所保障乎。</p>
<p>（壬）頌布保護醫師之法規　醫爲職業之一。其關係於民族健康之前途者。至大且鉅。故各國政府對於醫師之産生。旣有嚴密之規定。而對於已開業之醫師則又盡其保護之責任焉。吾國政府則不然。於律師及政府之行政人員皆有其保護之法規。於醫師則無之。此甚不可解也。頻年以來。醫師有無罪而受人控告者矣。有無故而受官廳之非法逮捕者矣。匪獨無特别保護之可言。抑若普通人權而亦不能享受然者。凡吾同道。不將人人自危耶。政府不欲新醫之發展則已。若欲中國有獨立之新醫。則頒布保護新醫之法規實爲當前之急務也。</p>
<p>（三）醫團方面</p>
<p>醫團者。集醫界之全體分子。以共謀醫界之利益者也。政府所當爲者。醫團有供獻意見督促實行之權。政府所不及爲。或非政府所應爲者。醫團有直接起而爲之之權。茲歸納之。而得以下各項。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（三十六）腸結核（腸癆）</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做腸結核病？怎樣發生？</p>
<p>（答）腸結核，就是腸癆，大都是因爲肺結核時咯出的痰嚥下，而致其中所含的結核桿菌侵入腸中而起。也有因爲小兒喝了患結核病中的乳汁或母體患結核病的乳汁而原發性起的。</p>
<p>（問）腸結核發生的部位，在腸中的那一部分？</p>
<p>（答）在濾胞層先形成粟粒結核，後來融合破壞而成潰瘍；或在盲腸壁起腫瘍狀肥厚，或在直腸内生潰瘍膿瘍或瘻管。</p>
<p>（問）腸結核的病狀，怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）大都徐徐發病，有頑固的泄瀉，每天二回到三回，排出柔軟或薄粥狀液體，混有灰白色黄色小片和不消化食物的殘渣。倘用顯微鏡檢查的時候，見有膿球脂肪。和脂肪結晶。並且證明潛在性出血。</p>
<p>（問）直腸結核時，起什麽症狀？　　（答）直腸結核時。除上述的症狀外，還有劇烈的裏急後重。</p>
<p>（問）腹部觸診有什麽症狀？</p>
<p>（答）觸診的時候，和慢性腸炎相同，有雷鳴音，在右側髂骨窩；並且訴疼痛。</p>
<p>（問）腸内潰瘍治愈後，是否結成瘢痕？</p>
<p>（答）是的。往往形成瘢痕而貽留腸管狹窗。</p>
<p>（問）潰瘍積久不愈，有什麽危險？</p>
<p>（答）往往起强出血或腸乳孔。</p>
<p>（問）結核如果生在廻盲部，右側下腹有没有異狀？</p>
<p>（答）這時候右側下腹部硬固而能長時觸知腫物。</p>
<p>（問）腸結核病人的食慾，是否障碍？</p>
<p>（答）未必障碍，但漸次羸瘦，起貧血，營養不良和脱力。</p>
<p>（問）病勢更進行，呈現什麽兇險的症狀？</p>
<p>（答）到後來程度更深，排泄水狀的大便，持續有含的多量脂肪質在糞便中。</p>
<p>（問）腸結核病的危險程度怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）是非常危險的，大都不治。</p>
<p>（問）這種病應該怎樣的療治？</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>（答）對於泄瀉，給以牛乳或薄粥等食品，腸部須要加以温暖。藥物祇有用各種收歛藥，像鞣酸劑，次硝酸鉍或吸着藥像炭末之類。有時可行外科手術把廻盲部的結核病卻除去，但必須在早期可以施行。直腸結核，可行搔爬術除去他。</p>
<p>（問）有没有預防方法？</p>
<p>（答）腸結核的預防，在乎勿飲癆病牛的牛乳，已患肺結核的人，切勿把咯出的痰嚥到腸内。</p>
<h3 id="c222">兒童牙齒之防護法（上） <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>緒論</p>
<p>現代文明進步。醫學發達。素號病夫之吾國。亦漸知衛生之重要。學校中漸能注重衛生教育。社會人士。漸能注意於飲食起居之清潔。健康之增進。疾病之預防。惟於口腔衛生。齒牙防護，尚未獲相當之注意。夫口腔不潔。齒牙不健全。不特不能輔助消化。且爲微菌發育之良好所在。其影響健康甚鉅。國人習慣。平日旣疏於洗刷保護。卽至蛀蝕發生。仍多遷延不治。任其惡化。必待至發炎化膿。腫脹疼痛。方逼而求醫。往往牙齒因而犧牲。咀嚼爲之不全。胃腸受其累。健康蒙其害。且其賊害健康之進行。極爲和緩而不易察覺。日積月累。爲害乃烈。往往有患牙數年。日受其害而不自知。徒嘆身體之漸弱。罔知根本之治療。夫牙患之不爲人注意旣如彼。而其害不易爲人察覺又如此。此所以牙患普遍全國。一任其於無形中損耗國人之體力。此實爲整個民族健康之大病。而憂國之土。所不得不大聲疾呼。以喚起社會之注意也。</p>
<p>齒牙之保護。當自兒童時期始。蓋若乳牙蛀缺。或生長不正。大足以影響成人牙齒。且腐蛀之乳牙。不潔之口腔。極易發生種種危險之兒童口腔病。如各種口炎奮森氏咽峽炎等症。常足以危及生命。</p>
<p>爲父母者。孰不愛其子女。望其成一聰明强健之青年。平時對於其衣食起居保護惟恐不週。然於其齒牙。顧漫不加意。聽其自然。以爲無關緊要。任其牙患之發生。使成人牙不能得正當之生長。終身受其累。良可慨也。余故於論成人牙患之前。先作此篇。詳論兒童之口腔衛生。乳牙之保護。良習之養成。苟依而實行之。豈特兒童時期之幸福。抑亦爲終身牙齒健全之基礎焉。</p>
<p>初生嬰兒之口腔衛生</p>
<p>欲清潔嬰兒之口腔。最好用一柔軟之布條。或消毒藥棉。捲於食指上。浸於百分之二硼酸溶液中。然後輕擦嬰兒之口腔。每日數次。嬰兒漸長大時。此種磨擦。可繼續爲之。不特可使其口腔清潔。又可激刺乳牙之生長。同時可减輕出牙時之充血脹痛。</p>
<p>如嬰兒出牙發生困難或痛苦時。可往藥房買生牙藥水。常常磨擦之。可以减輕其痛苦。此事頗關重要。因生牙困苦。若任其延長。每易引起消化不良之症。此症極易轉劇。而致身體羸弱也。如上述方法。仍不能奏効。則應早請牙醫診治。於出牙部位。用手術刺破。則小兒立覺减輕痛苦。而安靜如常矣。</p>
<p>乳牙之功效</p>
<p>（一）小兒利用其乳牙。以學習咀嚼食物。俾將來對於成人牙。能運用自然。</p>
<p>（二）乳牙指導舌部。使其談話及搬運食物等工作。自然如意。</p>
<p>（三）乳牙能帮助唇頰等處肌肉。以固定面部容貌。（老人之齒牙脱落後。其唇頰肌肉。向内縮入。因其無齒牙支持之故也）</p>
<p>（四）乳牙維持其齒槽弓之自然形式與大小。使將來成人牙之排列。亦能整齊而美觀。　　乳牙之生齒時期</p>
<p>（一）正中門牙約誕生後六月至八月</p>
<p>（二）側面門牙約八月至十月</p>
<p>（三）第一大臼齒約十月至六月</p>
<p>（四）犬牙約十六月至二十月</p>
<p>（五）第二大臼齒約二十月至三十月</p>
<p>成人牙之生齒時期</p>
<p>（一）第一大臼齒約五歲至七歲</p>
<p>（二）正中門牙約六歲至八歲</p>
<p>（三）側面門牙約七歲至九歲</p>
<p>（四）第一小臼齒約八歲至十歲</p>
<p>（五）下顎犬齒約九歲至十一歲</p>
<p>（六）第二小臼齒約十歲十二歲</p>
<p>（七）上顎犬齒約十一歲至十三歲</p>
<p>（八）第二大臼齒約十二歲至十四歲</p>
<p>（九）第三大臼齒約十七歲以後生出</p>
<p>上列二表。係依照足月而算。但因各人之體力不同。出牙時期。略有先後。</p>
<p>乳牙早期失落之惡果</p>
<p>吾人己知上列之換牙時間表。在某時期内。某齒摇動。則摇動之齒。自應拔去。以便成人牙生出。如齒牙尚未至換牙時期而早數年失去。則謂之早期失落。其惡果如下。</p>
<p>（一）乳牙共計二十隻。各有其特殊之任務。如早期失落十隻。則所餘十隻須强逼担任原有二十隻乳牙之工作。其必力不勝任疲勞不堪矣。</p>
<p>（二）乳牙在換牙時期拔去。則成人牙生出。自然整齊美觀。如早期失落。則其前後之乳牙。必向中間空隙傾斜。將來其成人牙生出時。因無空隙地位。則必向内方或外方斜出。或埋伏於下面。於美觀上非常不雅。</p>
<p>（三）齒牙前後不齊。則其上下咬合必不正。且難於洗擦。易藏污物。蛀蝕往往由此而發。</p>
<p>（四）下顎齒牙愈參差不齊。則牙床骨愈縮短。而形成下頦退後之狀態。使魁梧雄偉之臉龐。一變而爲衰頽不振之醜態，如上顎未縮退而下頦退後。則其上顎門牙必突出。而上唇亦向外突出矣。非特不美觀。且易養成口腔呼吸之惡習。</p>
<p>（五）如上顎乳牙早期失落。亦可使上顎牙床骨狹小。因此鼻控縮小。而易生咽鼻部淋巴增殖病。及其他呼吸器疾病。</p>
<p>觀此五項惡果。則吾人必須保留兒童之乳牙至換牙時期。故每一乳牙。若非腐蛀化膿。無法醫治時。絶對不可輕易拔去。爲父母者。不可不注意上列換牙時期表。以便時常參考。</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（十一）咽頭扁桃腺增殖症</p>
<p>（本病因生在鼻咽腔的咽頭扁桃腺漸漸增殖而成）</p>
<p>本病又名腺樣增殖症。原名Hyperplasie　der　Racheutonsille　或名　Adeuoide　Vegetation這病完全是小兒病。從五歲到十五歲的學齡時期。生這種病的最多。成人生的很少。在臨床上看起來。有遺傳的關係。譬如一個家庭當中。有三四個小孩子。一個一個都會先後生這種病的。在統計上説起來。是不分男女的。也不分貧富的。</p>
<p>這病最主要最顯明的。是鼻閉塞。因此發生（一）寢後鼾聲，（二）睡眠不安，（三）僅用口腔呼吸（因鼻咽腔被咽頭扁桃腺增殖，閉塞鼻腔，阻止鼻呼吸而然。）這等現象，發生如果長久。那就現出一種特異的面容。就是（一）口腔常開，（二）顔面肌肉弛緩、（三）顔面缺乏表情的機能，（四）鼻背扁平，鼻孔狹小，（五）鼻孔周圍常致糜爛（因鼻液的刺戟發生濕疹的綠故）。在醫學上這種現象呌做腺增殖性顔型Habitus　Adeuoides此外精神發育。也很遲緩。記憶力减退。做事懶惰。頭痛頭重。這都是因爲鼻咽腔閉塞的緣故。又應該注意的。小兒遺尿症往往也有因這種病而來的。</p>
<p>講到他的合併症。最容易發生的。是（一）耳病，如歐氏管閉塞症，慢性中耳加答兒，急性或慢性化膿性中耳炎等。所以小兒時常感覺耳鳴，難聽，和耳漏。（二）小兒容易傷風咳嗽。以致時常發生氣管各病。（三）因爲咽頭有不斷的分泌物流下。黏膜被他剌戟。往往引起咽頭炎。小兒時常覺有咽頭乾燥，喉痛，咳嗽等等現象。我們做醫師的。如果遇着這種小兒的時候。一經診察他的硬口蓋。就常常發現變形。這種變形，就是硬口蓋特别的狹長。門齒向前方突出。日期如果長久下來。胸廓的發育。也要受到影響。肺部也就隨時可以發生疾病。患着這種病而有上面講的各種現象的小兒。如果再不就醫。遷延下去。那就小兒的營養。漸次不良。全身的發育。也都被障礙。現出貧血的病態。這個時候，在醫學上。稱爲腺增殖性惡液質Adeuoide　Kachexie。這樣的小兒。在健康上説起來。固然是完全不良。就是對於生命上。也往往可因此發生問題啊。</p>
<p>講到本症的治療。也和上期所講的口蓋扁桃腺肥大症一樣。藥物是無效的。只是行手術的一法。這種手術，是完全没有危險的。十分鐘就可完畢。我所希望的。就是閲報諸位家庭中的小兒。如於上面所講的情形。像（一）鼻閉塞，（二）口腔呼吸，（三）面容和精神都很呆滯，（四）耳鳴難聽等等。那就應當立刻囑托專科醫師。詳細診察。就可以得到解决的辦法。</p>
<p>▲答張誠君</p>
<p>承函詢關於貴恙症狀，似分兩點：第一點須請内科專家詳細診察消化器，究竟有無疾病。第二點似與扁桃腺有連帶關係，如確係扁桃腺病，當然可行摘出手術，按此種手術，一屋期卽可痊愈，成年及已結婚者，對於手術絶無妨礙，但非經診察後，不能詳細答復。</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>這一種分期的辦法，在純粹學理上雖没有大價值但繼起作精密修正的人們，是始終有的；這裏面的詳細情形，當然不是這一篇淺説所可盡的。除此外，還有一種較新的分期辦法，他的立論性質，是和前者完全不同的；這就是蘭克Tanke的本病三期説了。</p>
<p>蘭氏的第一期是初期集合，這是指最初病灶和附加的淋巴腺體病併合而言血管系統而言的。在這時期中，病人對其種結核菌毒質，會起劇烈反應的。這一種反應現象，是抵抗力的表現。所以這一期蘭氏又給他一特殊名詞，呌做反應過敏期。這一期中的明顯例子，就是散在性栗粒結核。第三期係指血管道的蔓延而言，此種蔓延的途徑，係指氣管枝腸部和其他的排泄器而言的。在這時，也都包括在裏面的。對於反應現象，反面漸漸消减了，和第一期是差不多的。這一種三期分類，係根據結核症的演進惰形，和反應現象，而出發的，和前面的一種辦法是毫不相干的。雖然有許多事實，不能像這樣畫一的；但學理上相當的價值，無論如何，我們是不能否認的。</p>
<p>上面所述的兩種分期説，雖一樣同是三期，其實雙方的内容是完全不同的。尋常一般人口耳相傳的，完全係指第一期種而言，和蘭氏的是毫無關係的。因蘭氏的第一期初期集合，係完全根據病理解剖上的情形而言，在外表固提不出什麽症象，對於（病）這一個字，根本是不够資格的。第二期的情形，也是潛伏的居多。這一種情形，和前面的一種是完全不同的。所以我們也不妨大胆地説，就是；平常一般人所指的肺結核症，幾乎可以説，都是包括在蘭克所指的第三期裏面的。換一句話説，就是；憑藉病勢面種大小而立論的第一種辦法中的第一期第二期，也可以説是蘭氏第三期了。至於第一期可痊愈第三期無希望這一種話，雖不是决對的眞理，但和第一種的分期説針鋒相對，是毫無疑義的；對於蘭氏的説法，是揷不進去的。這兩種名同實不同的分期説的眞相，是狠容易使一般人目迷五色而莫知所從的，所以我在此處，也不嫌瑣碎一一的提出了。</p>

<h3 id="c225">白話文的洗清和充實 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 仲元</p>
<p>一面儘管提倡（土話），（漢字拉丁化），一面却也不該忘記非馿非馬的白話文在目前還是應用極廣的傳達思想的工具。倘使要馬上一脚踢開這該死的白話文，那麽，我們的一些討論大衆語的文章先就没有法子寫在紙上；——不，不，我倒能够用（士音）寫出來，就怕（看得懂）的人比這非馿非馬的白話文還要少得多啦！</p>
<p>所以在目前，主張一脚踢開白話文的先生們，雖然勇敢得很，澈底得很，就可惜有點近乎自己解除武裝。</p>
<p>目前必須和提倡（土話），（漢字拉丁化）等等工作同時並進的，應該是（先使白話成話）。這也是早就有人説過了的，可是兩個月來（大衆語討論）的（論壇）上把這一方面的工作太冷落了。</p>
<p>應該分一部分人力出來檢討目前的白話文爲什麽不成話；應該提出具體的方案來，改良目前的白話文，——就是清洗目前的白話文，充實目前的白話文，使其更能負荷這一段時間的特殊的使命</p>
<p>説到（改良）這一層，我們就會想到（白話文）裏的一些（濫調）。例如：（我是如何的悲哀喲！）這句話，説牠一定讀不出，聽不懂麽，倒也未必；可是這句話本來就不是活生生的（口語），再加以濫用，有時當眞會呌人感到肉麻。像這種的（濫調），細找起來，很不少。再，就是一些呌人看不懂（或者難懂）的歐化句法。這可以舉個實例。（把肚前皮帶緊了緊的鐵民，呼吸急促之點，用歡快的眼向後瞟了半個圓。）還有一句：（兩天來陰沉着，現在突然晴現出一層欣笑，微張開了嘴，太陽晒得棕黑，再厚厚擦上一層灰土和臭汗的膏的國雄的臉。）採用歐法句法，我們是贊成的，但像上面所舉的例，簡直是入了魔道了。這就是不成話的白話文。最後，白話文裏採用一些文言的字眼，也得有個限制。</p>
<p>所以要（改良）目前的白話文，第一應該先來做一番（清洗）的工夫。要剔除（濫調），避免不必要的歐化句法，和文言字眼。做這一項工作，單提出原則還嫌不够，必須舉出例來給大家看：那一些是（濫調），那一些是不必要的歐化和文言字眼。自然例是舉不周全的，但旣然造成了一種濃厚的（清洗白話文）的空氣，青年們下筆的時候自會斟酌避免了</p>
<p>第二就要設法（充實）現在的白話文。寫白話文的人，十個裏倒有九個感到字不够用，——特别是形容字，語助字不够用。因爲不够用，就只好到文言裏去借些來。這未嘗不是一個辦法。我們相信文言裏有些字眼可以借來用，並用可以因此使牠（復活），成爲（口頭語）。舉眼前的例，（美麗），（悲哀），（動摇），（彷徨），（追求），（幽悒）……之類，都是。還有（妥恊），（堅决），（策略），（鬥爭），一類的字眼，那就簡直成爲大衆的慣用語了。不過單靠借用，也還不够。我們還得採用（方言）。例如廣東話的（頂括括），上海話的（像煞有介事），北方話的（壓根兒）之類。過去有些文藝作品很採用了些（方言），但是採用的目的多半是爲了加重那作品裏的（地方色彩）。現在我們的目的却是要用（方言）來代替那些不得不借用的文言字眼。例如包含了（舞弊中飽）·（分肥），（沾光）等等意義的上海話（揩油），就是已經多筆頭上用慣，比那些文言字眼神氣得多。我們就要儘量採用這樣的方言，我們並且還要採用一些特殊的方言，例如上海話的（起碼人）。這話所包含的意義，不但文言中找不出相當的字來，就是别處的方言裏，恐怕也没有。</p>
<p>我相信：倘使從這（洗清）和（充實）兩路下手切實做工夫，那麽，眼前這踢開不成拏着不行的白話文可以更加和大衆接近。而且可以進化到將來的統一的大衆語。因爲我們眼前用的（白話文）是北方話作底子的，北方話的使用範圍佔全國面積十分之七，將來自然而然的趨勢恐怕總是南腔北調的（普通話）造出個相對（統一）的局面來，——雖然現在有人不承認（普通話）是大衆語。</p>
<h3 id="c226">青年底災難 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 白戈</p>
<p>只要翻闇報紙一看，大約每天總是可以看出一些關於青年底自殺的消息的。貪生怕死，人之常情，這是熟透人情的一句老話，也就是一般執法者以死刑作爲一般犯罪者底最後裁判的心理根據吧，爲什麽許多特别富於生機的青年反而這樣富於死趣呢？自然，我們不能忍心如像那些專門責備青年的道學先生們所説：完全是由於青年底不自覺。</p>
<p>其實呢，這到與青年底自覺，或不自覺没有什麽關係的。譬如説，就以各個報紙上所載的消息來看吧，主要的原因大多不外兩種：一是經濟恐慌，一是失戀。不過近來又出了新花頭，還有所謂會考落第這一種。然而我們能够説這些原因都是由於青年底不自覺所招致的嗎？</p>
<p>如果一定要説是由於青年底不自覺的話，那我們首先不得不要求社會給青年以自覺底道路和機會。青年應該怎樣自覺呢？又要怎樣才能自覺呢？這些問題都是應該馬上解决的。然而目前的社會却一點也不給青年以自覺底道路和機會，而且反要千方百計地加以阻塞和隔絶。自覺是不允許的，不自覺是要受賃備的。不自覺的青年自然非走到末路不可，這就呌做（自作孽）。如果眞的自覺了嗎？那却連一條末路也不能走，這就呌做（走頭無路）。所以結果只能自己背着不自覺的罪狀而走到末路——自殺，這就呌做（活該）。</p>
<p>事實是很顯明的。單以最近流行起來的會考落第自殺這一事實而論，我們相信有許多人一定要認爲是活該。除了自殺者底父母感到悲痛外，别的父母或師長也許要抓着這一事實作爲教材向自己底子弟或學生説：您們還不趕快用功嗎？看看某人底結果！然而，實際上，原因却不在自殺者底不用功，而在自殺者底有功無從用和雖用亦無功等等。許多不同環境的學生，受着種種不同的教育，（有的教他們學得肩擔手提的本事，準備將來下就，例如尢墨君先生；有的教他學得等因奉此的古文，準備將來上升、例如汪懋祖先生）而以同一的不切實的試題去會考他們，誰能擔保他們不會落第而自殺呢？於是便落得别人説他們一聲（活該），因爲這是由於他們底不自覺呀！但要眞的自覺呢，那便非反對這種會考不可，結果恐怕還不是落第自殺所能了事的。總之：這是目前的青年底災難。</p>
<p>有災難應該消解。以前和現在，各地方不是用了大批欵子來設壇祈禱，爲老百姓消解災難嗎？據説，青年是將來社會底柱石，依道理我們是更應該拿出大力來爲青年消解災難的。不過，這裏却用得着説青年底自覺或不自覺了，主要的責任乃在青年自身。換句話説，青年底災難雖不是由於他們底不自覺，但要消解這種災難却在他們底自覺。而且，我們不妨這樣地説：只要一般青年都知道這點，那末他們底災難也就可以消解了。</p>

<p>— 吳曉晨</p>
<p>在目前中國内政外交等一切根本問題待决的時候，除了東北問題以外，恐怕誰都感覺到農村破産的嚴重化，高過一切．農村的衰落，旣是無可掩飾的事實，形成的原因，又不止一端，要復興農村，就不能不明白牠的組織，方始可以對症下藥，這决不是偶然的一回事呢！在這千頭萬緒的情勢下，農村破産聲浪，旣是高唱入雲，二五减租一問題，就很有注意的價值，牠影響於佃業二方很大．最近雄藩先生在四月二十五的大公報經濟週刊上發表一篇一浙江的二五减租和永佃權，）對浙東田務情形，及施行二五减粗後的反應，有深刻的介紹和理論。浙東和浙西雖祇隔一條錢塘江，但浙西的情形，和浙東又很有不同的地方。我現在也來談談浙西施行二五减租後的成效，和以往租務情形，及田畝性質，並對雄藩先生提出的數點，有所商榷。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>和土地發生連鎖關係的，大槪有二點，處分權和使用權，從這二點上成立了佃業的對象；佃是佃農，就是享有使用權的種户，業是業主，就是握有處分權的由東。佃農和業主二者之間的交接，雖很密切，但界限也劃分得非常清楚，在彼此所應負擔固定條件以外，任何一方，均不得干涉一部或全部。這是因爲一畝田的組織，發生二重物權的緣故，牠的名稱，各處略異，浙西一帶均稱業主所握的呌田底，佃農所有的呌田面。也有底面握在一人手裏，這僅限於自己使用所有物的農民，爲數極少，並且隨時仍可以分開，不受任何牽制的。田底是有管業孰照和承糧户摺爲憑證，照法律上規定，可依據單據，對於所有物有自由使用收益處分的權利。但在事實上，因有田面的限制，對佃農祇能以獲得收益爲條件，將土地給農人使用，收益以外的處分權，範圍極小。同時佃農所有的田面，牠是以享得使用權爲條件的代價，在習慣上有一部分權力，不爲業主所左右的。但是佃農因田面而所得的權力，却不能對業主應有的處分權，表示異議或干涉。田面並没有單據，不過以私人賣買契約爲憑，佃農是因此享有永佃權的。所以田面的代價，也就是永佃權的代價。至於由面的起源歷史，雖然已很久遠但我們很可以明白，這是業主恐怕佃農拖欠租米，預先向佃農收一筆押租，如租借房屋之有頂首一般。不過這筆押租，業主始終没有發還，佃農以爲要種他人所有的田，當然要出相當的代價，這樣一來，佃農就保持了佃權。後來人口不似土地有固定的數量而不斷的增加，形成了人多地少不平衡的局面，大家少不得要競爭，押租起初極式微，因此就狂拾暴漲起來，到達了最高峯，這是人口和土地不平均下應有的結果；田面也成爲一種特殊組織了。佃權由暫時而變爲永久，可以傳襲或自由買賣，無形中養成的權力，竟超出租賃性質的使用權以外。業主和佃農雖然發生土地的連鎖關係，同時因田底田面的壁壘，而成爲均勢的對立。所以有時所有權變更，而永佃權不變更；或永佃權變更，而所有權不變更。業主的處分權，實在是狹義的。業主購買田地，除非向佃農同時買得田面，－永佃權－絶對不能自己耕種的，祇有每年向佃農收租的權利。佃農並得將所種田地，任意變更形式，如易水田爲旱田，易耕地爲宅基，或因弟兄析産將整方一分爲二，如不拖欠租米，均不受業主拘束的。而業主轉移産權，佃農也没有優先承買的權利，更没有絲毫干預的可能。佃農買賣田面，業主也無顧問的權力，設欠有陳租，得向頂户繼續追償，這是小小不同的地方。田地的底面二部分，各有獨立精神，造成了二重物權。所以雄藩先生提出的二點疑問：一（産權轉移的時候，新業主何以必須准許舊佃户繼續耕種？）二（佃權何以准許佃户自由轉移？）就是二重物權下各目行使固有的權利。看了上文，很可以明白的。雄藩先生説：（水佃權在從前的時候，是對人權，是相對權，也許不是一種物權，而爲一種債權，業主是債務人，而佃户是債權人。）這也似是而非，佃農之所以獲得永佃權，是在使用權以外，照習慣上另有田面的規定，田面的起源，上面已説過，是對業主預繳一筆押租，也就是耕種他人所有田地的代價。所以業主雖然屢經變易，而這筆押租始終没有發還，已是無形消滅，業主對佃農也不負償還責任，因此就獨立一個名目呌田面，土地的所有權，完全爲佃業二方所共有了。任何一方，均不是債權人，也不是債務人，但永佃權却確確實實是一種物權。田面價格所以繼漲增高，因爲人口激增，也就是抬高佃農産業，並不是業主加收押租。因田面漲價而獲得的利益，完全屬於佃農，假使一朝人少地多，有田無人耕種，那田面二字，非特要動摇，也就根本不能成立。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>業主將所有土地，給别人使用，是以獲得收益爲條件。佃農耕種他人所有土地，就負繳租義務。繳租的制度，各處不同，而且向來不由公家釐定，任從各業主自己斟酌，視各人不問的環境，參照大衆的情形來規定的。所以非特各處不相同，就是同一地方，各業主所訂定的租價，也很有參差·並不一律。租價的大小，影響於農民經濟很大，負繳租義務的佃農，對業主所規定的租價，無過問或抗議的權力；甚有超過最小之家一倍以上者，爲佃農經濟能力所不能負擔，也没有申辨的可能。這雖然是少數中的少數，但這輩有苦無告的佃農，忍受莫大的宰割，處境的可憐，令人表示無限同情和憤慨！可是話又説回來了，浙西一帶，杭嘉湖各屬，最多大地主。各縣田地有十分之七以上在大地主手裏，最大的業主，所握的土地在一萬畝以上的也很多。尚有十分之三不到的土地，是在小地主手裏，最少的祗有數十畝或百餘畝。他們的差額很遠，但是有田的人家，在傳統思想下，均是不事生産的居多，全家生活費用，就依靠着田租收入作挹注。大地主和小地主收益的不同，當然不能相提並論，可是要以此營養全家的目的，即是一致的，全年開支數目勢不能和田産比額走平，租價所以要高低，不能站立在一條水平線上，有時竟相差得很遠，牠的道理，就在這裏。倘使要劃一租價，也是一件非常困難的事情；第一·各縣田價高低不一，就是一縣之中，也很有上落，成本的大小，和收益的升降是正比例的。第二·農民種植情形，各縣不同。以秋季農人正宗出産論，種稻的當然居多，但也有種薑的，或棉花的·稻·薑·棉花三者性質，完全不同，收成的豐歉是互異的。租價旣是依據田價和收成來衡定，有上面所舉的二個原由，各縣要劃一，或者定一標凖租價，均是不容易辦得到的。官廳當局所以從來不預聞，或者也非偶然吧？田有底面，好像業主和佃農類似共有的形式，佃農繳租，是付還田底一部分應得的利益。業主有收租的權利，也負承糧納賦的責任。假使佃農拖欠租米，照平湖等處規例，業主可將該户應完糧賦推出，由財政局直接向佃農收取。嘉興以西的地方，就没有這樣辦法，佃農雖然積欠租米，應納糧賦，仍由業主負擔。繳租有幾處是繳現金，有幾處則繳米榖。嘉興海鹽等處是業主派人到鄉下去分頭收取，平湖嘉善等處則由佃農自己到業主家裏來還的。繳租的時期，有幾縣是以霜降節爲限，有幾縣以冬至節爲限，依照各縣生産早晚而定的，以上就是不同的地方。但是到了繳租限期，仍有未繳的，租價就要比限期前提高，以資區别，而示公允，這是各縣一律的。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>從民國十八年起，浙江施行一種二五减租，牠的目的·在補救以往收租制度之漫無標凖，使佃業二方的負擔，有適當的規定，尤其是維護農民經濟的發展，提高農民生産的能力。所以這個政策在浙省各項新政中，算是惟一的仁政。不過施行的時候，恰巧農村衰落，由緩進而變魚尖鋭化，農民生機正是在不絶如縷下掙扎，崩潰·破産·均到達了最高潮。一方面業主的地位，因農村衰落的激盪，也好像在狂風暴雨中一般。這個時候的環境，一重一重，深深地包圍着非常惡劣的空氣，二五减租在這般精勢下伸展，當然没有良好的成效。無况浙省各縣田畝情形各别，規矩方圓，不去因勢利導，輕輕地將性質不同的東西，要牠走上一條道路，苦樂不匀之弊，又那裏能够免除呢？在浙東據雄藩先生所舉的有五點，吾現在節錄在下面：</p>
<p>（甲）田價大跌，從前值一百元一畝的田，現在祗值六七十元了。這一點是好的情形，還是不好的情形，我們很難批評。因爲從好的方面來説，正是二五减租的成功，田價跌落，可以使農民增加買田的機會。據我所知道的，近幾年來的新業主，的確以農民占多數。可是從不好的方面來説，全社會的産業價值，减少了許多，對於社會經濟不無影響。在從前有二三十畝田的收入，一家數口，可以過苦生活，在現在就不行了。</p>
<p>（乙）人民對於産業的心理大變，從前人民有了積蓄，總要買田置産，以爲田産是子孫萬世之業，自從實行二五减租以來，有産業的人，都想把現有的田産一槪出賣，祗愁無人顧問。因爲田産愈多，淘氣愈多，如果佃户不繳租，非打官司不可。那末不是爲了幾十元收入，再賠上幾十百元的訟費，眞是何苦呢。何况這種官司多半是業主夫敗的，（特别在佃業理事局的時代，業主控佃户很難得勝）寗可冒着危險，將金銀存在銀行錢莊生息，不肯買田置産。</p>
<p>（丙）在從前的時候，業佃兩方大抵相安無事的。可是到了現在，情形不同，雙方感情很壞，動不勒就打官司。聽説有一個鄉下財主，同時有十三處官司，所收的傳票大有應接不暇之槪。如果不打官司，做業主的祗好淘氣。有一個業主間仰户的繳租條件請不妥，　　將由荒起來，那個佃户果眞將田一分爲二，認爲業佃各半，祇種自己的半坵。</p>
<p>（丁）自從二五减租以來，業主的收入大大的减少了，可是他對於政府所負担的賦税，不但没有减輕，反而逐年加重。照理説，政府旣實行二五减租，就應該爲人民實行二五减賦，纔算公平，近幾年來政府不但不實行二五减賦，反而實行二五或二五以上的加賦。據説糧賦較重的縣份，在米價大跌的年頭，業主的收入，祗够完糧呢。</p>
<p>（戊）可是二五减租對於永佃權大有利益。永佃權的價值，比從前大漲，大槪一百元一畝的所有權，跌到六七十元一畝、而這種田的永佃權，由三十元漲到五十元左右一畝，有幾處永佃權的價值，簡直同所有權等。所以近來一般人民，就是農民也在其内，對於買田置産的興味很少，到處只聽到有田無人買。而永佃權的移轉，大不相同，農民只要有稍許積蓄，就要買永佃權了。我曾問過許多農民，永佃權何以比所有權好？他們説永佃權的好處：第一，没有錢糧，因爲田賦是歸業主負担的。第二，不至於派捐，譬如省政府向各縣派公路公債，縣政府總是向田産多的業主派的，不會向佃户來派的。據我考察的結果，永佃權漲價最大的原因，由於實行二五减租。因爲照二五减租辦法，减下來的百分之二五的收穫，是歸佃户所有的，在鄉間看來，擁有二十畝永佃權的農民，比擁有二十畝所有權的自耕農富裕。後者的收入，雖然比前者多，而他的負擔比前者重。往往又擁有二十畝永佃權的農民，將一部份永佃權的田地，暫時讓給他人耕種。這種人就是種户，有的是外來的客民，有的是本地的貧農。在浙江人多地少，許多人祇要有田可種，不問久暫，一律願意的。佃户知道這種情形，就用拍賣的方式，招收種户，那一個種户肯出最高租額，就可以得到耕種的權利。所以今年時種户是張三，明年換了李四，後年又變爲王五的。這些種户是不能享受二五减租的利益的，他們每年所繳的是最高租額；一方面佃户收到種户的租以後，就將百分之二五的收穫扣下來，歸本人所有，再按規定的租額，即將百分之七五的收穫，和業主平分。業主照例向佃户收租，不向種户去收租的。所以佃户可以扣下百分之二五的收穫。但是我始終不明白，佃户憑那一種理由可以享受不勞而獲的收入，政府對於這弊端是否知道？</p>
<p>從上述的五點看來，很可明白浙東出價慘落，人民對産業心理大變，使社會經濟受莫大之影響。而農民蓄意抗租之結果，永佃權價格，突然抬高。業主的地位，在收入大减，賦税反增的處境下，那得不呻吟喘息。二五减租簡直是佃農的護身符，一方拿來對抗業主，一方拿來壓迫種户。種户因永佃權的束縛，横受佃户的削剝，豈不是二五减租，反形成助桀爲虐的趨勢。至於雄藩先生説（佃户憑那一種理由，可以享受不勞而獲的收入）這就是永佃權的代價，和業主站在同一的地位，同一的立塲，並不是毫無理由和根據的。不過在浙西没有這種情形，佃農將田地招人耕種，更是稀有的事，也不似浙東那樣簡單，所以施行二五减租後的結果，也大相逕庭。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>浙西地主向分大小二等，大的極大，小的也極小。小業主因爲收入短少，開支浩大，不用正當方法來補救，無理的抬高租價，魚肉佃農，實在是説不過去的事。二五减租一來，這輩大刀闊斧，横斬豎劈，不顧農民生計的小業主，果然不敢明目張膽，用高壓手段來横行一切了。可是浙西土地在小業主手裏的，十分之三尚不到，十分之七以上的土地，小大地主手裏。第一，大業主所握的土地旣極多，每年收入當然很可觀，拿來應付全家生活費用，非常富裕。用不着抬高租價。第一，租價向來没有標凖，可以各人自定，浙西的大地主，差不多在當地均負相當的聲望。租價短小，在浙西人士目光中，向來視爲非常榮耀的事情。所以均能不惜收入减少，爲保持名譽計，甘於犧牲一己。因此租價從來非常短小，離開二五减租的規定尚遠。不道這幾年來農村衰落的程度，一年深似一年，業主的固定收入，已年年要打折扣。而所負擔的賦税，却一年重似一年，附加税已超過正税，如建設特捐·建設附捐·治蟲費·區經費·徴收費·水利費·小學費·習藝所經費·農民銀行股本·保衛團經費·教育畝捐等疊牀架屋，不勝枚舉。一面政府向各縣派募公債，如二五·編遺等庫劵，公路·清理等公債，以及當地需用任何欠項，均是以田産多寡作標凖，向各業主派募的。各大業主以前生活很優裕，經不起這幾項打擊，接二連三的風浪，漸漸地到達了入不敷出，山窮水盡的地步。他們當然遷怒於目前政治之不善，但爲面子計，尤其是數十年來始終不懈，一心一德要保持的，在傳統觀念下，毫没有增加租價的勇氣，敢破壞以往的好名譽。自願在凄風苦雨中掙扎·困鬥。那知這個時候，適值浙省頒行二五减租，照二五减租辦法，對以往繳租期限，和催租手續，均須改變。這樣一來，業主的地位，更覺不安定，不特關係收租的遲緩，且將影響租米的收數，對欠租各佃户，催索的方法，更將困難而無實效。各大業主爲切身利害計，爲全家生活計，均不得不作有力之表示。於是就像狂潮怒浪一般，不約而同的抬高租價，照二五减租辦法所規定的作標凖，陽示服從法令，實在是憤憤不平下一個反響。這是最近幾年來的事實。但二五减租是大家公認的一項仁政，四施行不得其時，非常不美滿。在浙西所得的結果是這樣：</p>
<p>Ａ十分之三窮的佃農，尚來糧受小田主壓迫，現在蒙二五减租的好處，而减輕負擔。但是十分之七强的佃農，素來繳極小的租價，現在因二五减租一來，各大業主抬高租價，無端增重支出。受惠的紙十分之三　，被累的有千分之七强。豈不是利少審多，無怪大部農民怨聲載道·Ｂ租價增高，適在農村衰落的時候，農民的能力非常通弱，租務因以一落千丈。田地價格駿然狂落，由五十元一畝跌到二十元左右，使全社會産業减少了許多，整個社會經濟，受莫大影響。同時擁有現欵的人民，對田地均無意投資，使農村經濟，益形枯竭。這幾年内地現金向都市集中，致農村崩潰，增加速度，這也是一層大原因。Ｃ佃農則因連年榖賤絲廉，反見租價加高，入不敷出的差額，一年大似一年，已懷疑到種田恐怕不是農民的出路，所以田面價格隨田底價格一致狂跌。田面價值本來很貴，有幾處竟超過田底，現在已跌到念幾元一畝，尚且無人要買。這與浙東的情形，適巧相反。業主提高租價，類似飲鴆止渴，致每年收數，更不如前，一半還是農村衰落的緣故呢？但因田價的低落，自己産業無形减少，賦税則依然有增無减，收支更覺走不平，田地又賣不掉，即借欵也無人敢拿田産來承抵。支持全家衣食，益形困難。所以二五减租就各地情形不同，有分别改善的必要。最後對雄藩先生所提應該注意的幾點，我也來討論討論：</p>
<p>（一）减輕賦税確是刻不容緩的事，（現在紙有百分之三五的租額，照理説田賦也應該减少）而浙西每畝田的錢糧，差不多要一元五角，占收入士三分之一以上，豈不是太重，（我們同感要給佃户爭飯吃，同時邊應該留一點飯給業主吃）諠實在是至理明言！</p>
<p>（二）（在現在的情形看來，永佃權人對於政府的義務復少；同時在法理上經濟上看來，在存否二可之間，我們可以設法使永佃權减少。因爲有了永佃權，未免使所有權受了一種限制）這在浙東，因爲田地性質不同，或者可以試辦。在浙西就千萬不能推行，因這樣一來將使佃農地位，益形孤立，益覺没有保障。而在業主一方面，因自己不能種田，亦没有任何利益可言。反因永佃權價格因此低落，而對佃農失却信仰心。</p>
<p>（三）（今年浙江新辦）種永佃權契税，可以增加永佃權的負擔。可是這種税，祇有權利移轉的時候徴收一次，並不是每年徴收的。我以爲可創一種佃賦，就將業主方面所减賦税，加諸佃户身上）這也是在浙東或者可以辦，在浙西是不可能的。因爲浙西握有永佃權的佃農，就是種户，他並不是不勞而獲的。繳租的能力，已是百孔千瘡，那裏還能够擔負賦税？</p>
<p>不過目前正在農村破産聲中，我們正要集中力量來挽救農村的危急，尤其要使農民生活安定，這决不是區區二五减租所能負得起的大任。在這樣非常的時期，任何制度，要改弦更張，均不是容易的事。所以二五减租施行的結果，和理想大相背謬。二五减租制度，固然尚待改善，而最重要的，是對整個農村没有補救的計劃。現在要實施二五减租，須先預定復興農村步驟，相輔而行，然後纔有成效可言。</p>
<p>編者按，吳君所述情形，未能槪括浙西，亦似乎太偏重爲大地主説話，不過二五减租實行之後，確有種種，足爲該制度本身發生摇動，用將本文披露，以備研究之一助。</p>

<p>回憶十二年前，美國人之來東方考察蠶絲事業，其目的無非欲明悉生絲之如何製造；以何種方法，可得廉價生絲，供美國應用。良以彼邦爲全世界生絲消費最多之國，如一旦與鄰邦有事，供給立斷，危險殊甚，故不得不化費巨額金錢，研究人工製絲，旣可保持國内經濟，又可使生絲價值，日趨低廉。諸君不信，試觀近年美國生絲消費，逐年减少，即其明證。是以美國人造絲生産增加，即生絲需要退步；反之，生絲市價，在人造絲倍以上，生絲交易；立即缺少生氣。日人深悉此中情形，故多轉移其研究生絲目光，研究人造絲及人造絲與他種物品之交織品，從事於製造。初以出品不佳，祗供國内試用；自採用歐美之法，大事改良，昭和六年以來，計劃設廠，不遺餘力。今將本年四月末調查，該國已開工及定期開工之人造絲廠名；詳列於下，以供國人參考；</p>

<p>試思日本旣得生絲産座之王，而又從事於人造絲之巨量設計，蓋亦彼邦有識之士，洞悉生絲已無再進步之可能；價值方面，更無高漲之希望，難以獲利。萬一生絲最大主顧之美國，不需供應，彼之農村，可立即破産，爲未來之生活計，非生産巨量之人造絲與人造絲紡織品或他種相互交織品，棄廉價銷，不足以彌補前項損失。故其新建各廠，多具最新設備，今秋均可開詒製造，且與紡織　　，其發展種　，正不可限量。是以人造絲生産，日本將爲世界之冠，即美國亦將望塵莫及。考日本人造絲原料，向多購自美國，九一八以來，我東北各處，變爲彼那原料予取予求之地，無怪其放應進行，爭奪世界市塲矣。</p>
<p>查我國織物之夾用人造絲，原欲求其花色顯明，眩人耳目，以與舶來品絲綢，互相競爭，故其使用不多。及有爲迎合社會心理，以廉價美觀爲目的，乃將綿紗與人造絲交織，或純用人造絲之織物，供緒市塲，銷路大增，於是羣起紡織，而我國人造絲進口，遂與日俱進矣。英意德法等國之人造絲，行銷我國，在五年前，爲數頗巨。自日本實行傾銷以來，我人造絲市塲，日貨占有百分之七十以上，歐貨已覺難與競爭，恐不數年後，日本將獨占我市塲矣。</p>
<p>回顧我國生絲海外市塲，已被日本所據，出口數量，日見减少。而人造絲進口，反源源而來，何國人甘於自乘，將大好金錢，奉諸外人。今春各報，有我國自辦人造絲廠之説，惟至今不見動靜，豈又是言而不行之劣根性表現乎，願實業界有以教之。</p>

<p>— 洛基</p>
<p>——讀子師石君的（關於父子之間）後——</p>
<p>俄國屠格湼夫在一八六二年寫下了一部偉大的小説，那就是（父與子）。那部小説是描寫當時八十年代的新舊思想的衝突，這種思想的衝突，不但在一九三四年的今日蘇聨如此説得廣一點，在世界上，無一國没有這樣現象吧？</p>
<p>父子間的衝突，在師石君所引證井上池一郎的意見，據説就是因青年們的（性）的不饜足爲重大的基因。如果一個青年一旦擁有妻孥，立刻會變成穏健的老成者，而父子間的種種隔閡，也可由早婚而消滅於無形。這種主張，無論井上池一郎（具有深湛的學理根據），却不可不説是他的認識父子間的衝突的浮淺，如果我們的認識能够突入事象的核心，我們會對於井上池一郎的那種主張爲可笑的。</p>
<p>人類間的一切言動，都規定於社會的生産關係和生産力的，如果一旦生産關係和生産力的衝突發生，無疑的，人類間的一切言動，也爲那種衝突而表現出各各的不同來。父子間的衝突，也不過是這個人類間的大衝突之中的一個小衝突而已！</p>
<p>師石君認爲井上池一郎的（青年早婚能保持父子間的恊調）這種主張爲倚重於父親方面，故爲了要不偏頗的顧念着雙方起見，而覺得除了雙方（還就）外，是别無良策的，可是誰應該遷就誰呢？父來遷就子，還是子來遷就父呢？師石君謎樣似的（希望聰敏的讀者們能給牠一個中肯的論斷），而他自己的結論却擬暫緩發表。</p>
<p>愚雖不敏，却願在這一項題下作一解答。</p>
<p>我説：父也可以遷就子，而子也可以遷就父的。這怎麽説呢？因爲人類間的言動旣爲生産關係所規定，卽也可説：存在决定人們的意識，而父子間對於現實的認識的觀點如果同一，子同意於父的認識的觀點，卽子遷就於父；反之，父同意於子的認識的觀點，那就是父的遷就於子了。打個比喻説：父對於婚姻問題是非要（憑父母之命，依媒妁之言）不可的，而子却否定那封建的説法，而倡以（自由結合）爲之頡抗，這是一般父子間的衝突的表現。但有的（子）們受了舊思想的洗禮很深的，贊同那種（父母之命，媒妁之言）式的婚姻那時是（子）的遷就於（父）；相反，有許多（父）們，受了這個大時代的思潮的影響，對於（子）們的婚姻問題的（自由結合）表示絶對的贊同，這就是（父）的遷就於（子）了。</p>
<p>總之：父子之間是無所謂遷就不遷就的，在家庭裏父子間的衝突之風暴，也就是某一個時代的風暴的縮影！</p>

<p>— 雪爾</p>
<p>我喜歡冬天，這是每個老年人都有的脾氣。我不是老年人，不過有着老年人的同好而已。</p>
<p>冬天有可愛的太陽，老年人捧了手爐，啣着旱烟袋，談起長毛打來時逃難情形，拉長了臉好像尚有餘驚的樣子，談起現在的女人不像個女人了，就癟了嘴不禁感槪系之；偶然也談起中舉時的威嚇，閉了老花的眼睛，將着顔下的鬚，希望時間拉回四十年或五十年。我喜歡冬天，不是爲了這些，我喜歡冬天最好每天颭大風，下大雪。颭大風的日子，煮一壺上好的茶葉，在火鋒邊剖瓜子仁，聽那風聲從屋頂上躐過，再被大樹擋回來，最後像屋頂都要帶去似的咆哮着衝前去，一顆心彷彿追隨着到高山之顚，大海之濱。高頂上有參天的老松，海灘邊有潮湃的怒潮。如果你想到一個美麗的世界，也可以跟蹤着牠到烏有之鄉。能有幾個話得投機的朋友，那更有趣味了。颭風天這屋裏的世界是你們的；下了雪更佔有了屋外的世界。　　在南方不能玩溜氷，雪撬，堆雪彌陀也是有趣味的玩意兒；或者帶一個照相機，到近郊的鄉村，樹旁的一角茅屋，小溪邊的村姑，都是你需要的背景，雖是凍僵了手指，一顆心是熱辣辣的，冬天就是這般可愛。</p>
<p>我更喜歡秋天，老年人就没有這種愛好。據説秋是像徴着衰老，到落葉蕭蕭好季節，老年人的心不安起來，他們感覺到死神就在目前。其實老年人已到了衰老的年齡，衰老的人應該同衰老的季節表示好感，然而人類都是怕死的。這衰老的季節被我愛好了。</p>
<p>詩人也喜歡秋天，因爲詩人都是善感的，他們歌頌秋天，都是些感傷的調子；像老年人一樣。這是人類的怪僻，瞧見了春天紅桃綠柳就活躍起來，但不知秋天的楓樹是更美麗，而柳絲到了秋天也别有一番温柔滋味。祗要你不是一顆衰老的心，這世界到處是可愛的。春天是個蕩婦，她像蛇一樣迷惑，人們就覺得可愛了；但是要領略一個處女的美麗，就愛好這衰老的秋天吧！秋天和處女比較不一定是失敗的。</p>
<p>那美麗的輪廓已探在每個人的窗前，不要放在機會，她就是秋天！</p>
<p>我再説一次，只要你不是一顆衰老的心，秋天是一歲中最惹人喜歡的季節。</p>

<p>天色，蔚藍的。一陣陣的凉風，把樹葉兒吹響啦，有節奏的。悽惊的月亮，慢慢地上昇了。</p>
<p>哥哥回家啦。死灰的臉，白茫茫的嘴唇。他的神氣，太萎糜了。還没有坐定，就咯了一口血出來。</p>
<p>被生活壓迫着的哥哥喲，這是你太操勞了的原故。</p>
<p>家裏頭：母親，妹妹，和我這個不知事的弟弟。三個人都賴着你！三個人，都咬住你的肉。三個人，都吮着你的血。</p>
<p>（哥哥，你上醫生那兒去診一下吧！）</p>
<p>我們都知道：這樣，他是痛苦的。</p>
<p>（孩子！明兒别去做工啦。）</p>
<p>母親雖然知道他不做一天的工，我們就得挨餓一天。</p>
<p>（媽媽。不打緊的！）</p>
<p>哥哥一點都没有精神的睡到床上去了。</p>
<p>（哥哥，請個醫生來好嗎？）</p>
<p>我想：醫生總肯救救窮人的性命的。</p>
<p>哥哥聽了我的話後。感嘆的説：</p>
<p>（弟弟！我們那兒來錢看病？唉。）</p>
<p>慢慢的。他支持起來了。從藍布短衫袋裏，摸出了六毛錢。又説：</p>
<p>（弟弟，去買一點菜。糴一點米吧！餘下來的錢，先還一毛錢給隔壁張大嫂再説。）</p>
<p>我走出了這低陋的茅屋，帶着古董氣味的茅屋，我從不就住在裏邊的。白天裏，到垃圾堆裏去拾荒。餘下來的時候，就到近邊的不要錢的學校裏去識幾個字。</p>
<p>每天，我可以賺到十多個銅子。這幾個銅子，只好買一些洋油，可是它也只够點照一個晚上。</p>
<p>天上的星星，一點一點的，都鑽出來啦！</p>
<p>心裏面打算：哥哥的確太辛苦了。他常常做夜工，想多得到幾個錢。可是生來是衰弱的哥哥，怎經得起整日夜的勞作呢？只有希望他的病，一刻兒就好！</p>
<p>碰得眞巧！米店的對面，有醫生的牌子褂着。在米糴好的時候，我就闖進去想請求醫生去看看哥哥的病。可是給看門的巡捕，楱了個嘴巴。</p>
<p>忍着氣，退了出來。我没有火氣　因爲我知道：千錯萬錯，窮人頂錯。</p>
<p>買了三個銅子豆腐，八個銅子鹹魚。</p>
<p>順便，到隔壁張大嫂那兒。</p>
<p>（孩子，你待對哥哥説，有錢的時候，多還一點兒給我！……）</p>
<p>她的臉孔總是像家裏的東西被賊偷掉了的樣子。</p>
<p>我不跟她多説，就走了出來。</p>
<p>剛踏進門，哥哥的呻吟聲就聽得了！</p>
<p>洋油燈的光芒，格外顯得悲慘了。我不敢用鼻子深深地一嗅，因爲這……許多的血塊……哪！</p>

<p>— 麥女士</p>
<p>對過搬來了十個野美人兒，經我三五日的搜索，很滿足的發現了伊。</p>
<p>伊，是够美的，至少有我一個人這麽相信着。</p>
<p>伊有着都會女人的好的部份的風度，却絶無那種可惡的都會臭習。却又不是鄉曲的扮飾。而是處處得乎其中。一襲淡藍色的旗袍，恰恰表露出了伊的純眞的美妙。</p>
<p>體態是苗條的，是輕盈的，却又不是黛玉式的弱不禁風。方圓合度的臉，覆着長長的烏髮，起伏有節奏的身材，不是單綫形，却也不是那凹凸過度的所謂曲綫美，素凈的襪，素凈而平跟的鞋。走起路來是一跳一跳的，我一向見了伊就默默的呼喚着（你這野美人兒呵！）</p>
<p>是的，我的眼光並没有怎樣的差誤，許多見過她的人，都眞心的歸附我的品評。就是仙，他原是那麽的一味輕視伊，説伊太瘦弱了，缺乏肉的顫勸，近來也特别的殷勤凭窗瞭望伊，關心的注視伊的行止，伊的倩影。</p>
<p>最近我又發覺被伊吸引的人眞多啦</p>
<p>伊每天早晚，都要出門和回家一趟，那决不是伊的野行，我想伊定是在附近那一所學校裏唸書。正因爲伊這定時的出進的行止，使得某一些人忘懷歹心，説來眞是話長。</p>
<p>但是住在這麽一條深恭裏，到大街上去還相隔有那麽多彎，這些彎就成了伊的險峽。伊出門的時候總是要佇立躊躇一會，起初我還以爲伊是撒野弄嬌，那知伊正患着一種説不出的危懼呵！我注意着，果然有一天我發現了這危懼的所在，前面轉彎的地方，總是慣常站有兩個人在閒散，彷彿有所待似的。一看再看，才知道那就是使伊危懼的由來。我知道，那些站候的浪人，一定不是好人。</p>
<p>果然不錯，有一會仙告訴我，説是傍晚的時候，伊從外面回來，就在那轉彎的所在，被兩個浪人兒截住了，怪難看的糾纏不清，好容易伊才脱了險。</p>
<p>現在伊每回出去和回來，都要呌黄包車夫做伊的保護者了，有時候還要帶一個跟從——一個小孩兒或一個碩大的犬。</p>
<p>在上海這地方，女人眞没有自由，更没有保障。</p>
<p>野美人呀，我的一顆忠純的心，眞萬分的爲你焦灼，焦灼你終不能脱出這險禍呵！這條深深的巷子，就好比是一個險峽，你是弱者，你怎能跨過？你終竟有一天是要被害的，你爲什魔不遷居呢？我眞爲你躭心。</p>
<p>女人爲什麽這樣遭忌？這樣没有保障？</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>滬戰以前，我家裏可算是一個中上人家，但我們一點都不驕奢。在那時候，憑父母之命媒酌之言，我就與一個姓陳的訂婚，當時我祗有十八歲。訂婚之後，這個姓陳的常常壓迫我，他不許我與别個男女談話或來往，後來連女朋友都不准我結交，他把我當做他的私産，禁絶我增加志識，反對我去讀書。因此，不特我不能忍受父母與一切親友也都讚成我退約，但我未到法定年齡，不能自由作主，過了兩年半，終算與那姓陳的取消了婚約。這時候我覺得我是自由了，我的前途是很光明遠大了，我祇希望努力求學走到我成功之路。豈知在我退約半年後，又由朋友的介紹認識了一個男朋友！這個男人認識我後，不久就表示他愛慕之心，而且要强迫吻我，我嫌他太唐突，他也惱羞成怒，於是我們連友誼都不能保持，不過這個於我是没有損失，所以我也不覺得甚麽，如是者獨自一個用功了一年，誰知在去年底，我又與那個不見一年的男友相遇在一個交際會中，這次復交後，眞是出乎意外，我們竟會漸漸戀愛起來，而且現在已和他發生了肉體關係，不料我的，最尊嚴與可貴的處女，他因受了他的假愛就喪失了。現在他因爲很小的緣故，就借故不理踩我，而且聽到他又去另找新愛人了。但是我雖然遇到這不幸的事與不吉的消息，不知何故，我仍然死心愛他，仍然希望我們有復好和結婚的日子。但是我知道是没有可能性的，因爲我的確不能尋出一個法子來令他回心。因此之故，我旣恨他而又愛他，我自己煩惱痛苦，有幾次也曾想過自殺，但有時回心一想，我旣然白璧爲他留瑕，現在再因他而死，想必他也不會可憐我的，而且我尚有高年的父母在堂，我實在不忍心使他們再傷心一次。因爲我們經過滬戰之後，已變成破産的家庭了。我愈想愈可憐，經濟又拮据。尋職業又不容易，一個清白的身體，又受了這種侮辱，實在使我對於入生一點意味都没有。又没有法子可以報復我的私憤，因爲我没有證據能説他遺棄我。同時我恐怕别人不諒解我這不幸的遭遇，反説我浪漫的缘故。所以惟有自己飲恨在心。在心痛如裂的時候，眞眞想一死了之，不過在我未離開社會之前，尚請先生指示我一條生路，指導我應當怎樣對待他和怎安置我自己，敬祝撰安　　胡露笳謹上</p>
<p>來函……</p>
<p>答：編者常以爲在現社會之下做一個女子；眞是一件不容易的事情，舊禮教的束縛；險惡男子的欺騙，在在足以使她們痛苦或墮落，除非隨處能理知化；以理知來克服情感，方才可减少些痛苦和悲哀。</p>
<p>讀了你的來信，眞是忽起忽伏，忽喜忽憂，如看一本社會小説一樣，對於你的遭遇，無論何人固深表同情，但你的未能審始愼終底便把處女犧牲給人，亦是缺點。這就是犯着前面所説的未能以理知克服情感的弊病。同時在你的心裏，還存在着一種矛盾的思想，你一面已明白受了他的假愛的欺騙，一面仍然死心愛他，還希望他與你結婚，且又知道結婚是没有可能性的了。倘使這種矛盾心理不能解脱，那你的痛苦永難解除，你是一位有勇氣的女子，因你旣能與姓陳的解除婚約，便非平凡者流，那你爲何没有勇氣來與那種專以蹂躪女性的男子斷絶呢？他已欺騙了你，爲何你仍戀戀不捨他呢？要明白戀是肉慾的，愛是靈感的，他祇戀你，何曾愛過你，因爲要是愛你，又怎會中途因細故簡與你斷絶呢？所以編者認爲你應當把適去的撞影完全粉碎，不留一些影像在心裏，無用飲恨，亦無用痛苦面至自殺，重新認清生活的目標，一方面去找一正當職業，以補助家庭的經濟，亦可以使男子不敢輕視你，一方面以理知的眼光去找尋確實值得愛的男人，否則寗獨身勿字，免再蹈覆轍，這些便是編者所認爲指示你的一條生路。</p>

<p>－天哪，我…王老四，一輩子没有懶惰，偷要過半個時辰，只是，兒子，孫子給拉走了，自己病，病子没來得及種烟，唉…懶…懶捐，没有種烟，要抽我懶捐，我…我没有錢，只有這條老命…捐了我這條老命…媳婦，秀英，你們…你們娘兒倆，不要罣念着我，各人自己安分地生活·唉，寅生，元興…你，你們還能活着回來嗎…唉，我等不及你們了…</p>
<p>他的眼涙像車口裏的水樣地流滿了兩邊面頰，從腮邊滾落在地上，他己悲痛得昏迷了。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，王四爺硬僵僵地站在院門外邊的大柏樹底下，秀英抱住他的鵬使勁兒拖，拖不開，才發現他的陳子已經給一圈棕素子拴住了。</p>

<p>Young and Strong Men Transported to Chita and Boli / Russian Important Figures' Actions Under Surveillance / Japanese Aircraft Squadrons Practice Tactics / Regular Air Defense Drills Held / (Tianjin Dispatch) Harbin's Soviet-affiliated women have begun to retreat back to their country via the Sino-Eastern Railway Harbin-Manchuria line. Young and strong men subject to military service are having their passports obtained by the consulate and are reporting to Chita and Boli, with a deadline of one month. Those who do not return to their country by September 20th will have their Soviet citizenship revoked. Due to the impact of the Sino-Japanese War and volunteer army battles, as well as the continuous transportation by Japanese troops, the average daily income of the Sino-Eastern Railway for the second half of this year is less than 50%. The ruble has decreased by more than half from the previous monthly income of 120,000 rubles. The salaries of all employees of the railway have always been issued before the end of the month, but for August, they were issued before the 15th. The number of Chinese and foreign employees laid off from the railway is increasing daily. (19th Dispatch) / (Tianjin Dispatch) Recent news from Harbin indicates that due to the breakdown of negotiations regarding the sale of the Sino-Eastern Railway, the Harbin puppet police department is gradually adopting oppressive measures against important Soviet figures in Harbin. The residences of key figures, such as the Acting Director-General of the Railway, the Director of the Railway Bureau, and the newly appointed Russian Consul in Harbin, are under the secret surveillance of plainclothes Japanese military police and criminal investigators from the puppet police department. Any Chinese or foreign individuals deemed suspicious when entering or leaving the residences of important Russian figures in Harbin are subjected to inspection. A team of armed police is stationed at the Russian Consulate on Jilin Street in Harbin's Nangang district, ostensibly for protection but in reality to prevent consulate staff from having any external contact. War rumors are escalating in Harbin. Starting from the 11th, Japanese aircraft, in squadrons of four or five, have been practicing tactics in the air every morning at 7:00 AM, and deploying smoke screens. The Japanese Kwantung Army Command has scheduled a large-scale air defense drill in Harbin on September 15th, with participating teams already determined. The puppet Jiangfang Fleet will also participate at that time. (19th Dispatch)</p>

Zhao Dengyu and County Magistrate Chen Jiyan et al. waited for them at Ertaizi. Song et al. plan to return to Zhangyuan within days. (19th Dispatch) / Song Zheyuan of Zhangjiakou, accompanied by Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying, returned to Zhang early on the morning of the 19th after traveling through Chahar Province day and night. Song stated that the purpose of his trip to western Chahar was to inspect the border situation and the flood damage, as well as to review the garrison troops. The Yang Hou small regiment will be downsized due to its excessive size. Xiao stated that he arrived at the residence of Prince De on the 16th and met with Prince De, who is determined to support the central government. Rumors that Japanese personnel are permanently stationed at Prince De's residence are inaccurate. However, the Kwantung Army and the Japanese Good Neighborliness Group occasionally send people there for inspections, which cannot be prohibited due to the vastness of the Mongolian territory. He has already discussed solutions with Prince De: (1) The Chahar provincial government will set up an office in Pangjiang. Foreigners traveling to Mongolian territory will not be allowed to enter without passports from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chahar provincial government. (2) The Chahar provincial government will establish a liaison officer at Prince De's residence to facilitate communication between the two sides. Song has agreed. He plans to visit Chairman He in Beiping within days to report on the inspection. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch) Han Fuqu</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Party and government organs are mediating the dispute between the Ningkou and Zhou shipping lines over combined services. Because the Ningkou and Zhou lines' direct investors are losing money and the livelihoods of the indirect workers are being exploited, they have requested mediation from the party and government organs. Now that national railways and highways are gradually being opened up, the shipping industry has become a spent force. If combined services are suddenly implemented, it will harm others and be of no benefit to oneself, which is unwise. It is hoped that everyone will unite and cooperate to maintain shipping. As a result, Taichang and Yangzi will operate a total of twenty-five days per month, Yuanda five days, and the fare per ticket shall not exceed one yuan at most, including all miscellaneous fees. Taichang, Daan, Yangzi, Taifeng, and Yuanda will jointly rent a ship to operate the short lines between Zhou and Nanjing. All income and expenses will be distributed equally by the five bureaus. The ticket price is set at 5 jiao per ticket, including small accounts. The long lines will continue to stop as usual. The mediation process has been reported to the party, government, military, police, water police, and Ministry of Communications for review.

<p>(Nanjing) It is rumored that the Eurasia Aviation Corporation's Lanzhou-Ningxia route has been operating poorly and will be suspended. According to the person in charge of the company, the poor performance of the Lanzhou-Ningxia route is indeed a fact, but whether to suspend consideration of the Northwest route has been telegraphed to the chairman of Xinjiang Province for his consent. However, there has been no reply to date, so the resumption period is difficult to determine for the time being. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e36">American Silver Policy and China's Silver Export Situation <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Since the United States announced its national silver policy, it has not only brought about a major change in the currency system of the United States, but it has also had a significant impact on the world's silver market and the monetary value of silver standard countries. The former point has been briefly discussed in this newspaper before. Now, let's elaborate on the latter point.</p>
<p>The biggest impact of the American national silver policy on the world's silver market is the restoration of London's central position in the world's silver market. We only need to examine the recent silver market conditions and silver movements in London to fully prove this point. Secondly, it has an impact on China, because China is currently a major silver-using country.</p>
<p>According to recent observations, the impact of the American policy on China can be clearly seen from the movement of China's silver reserves. Because the American policy can make the overseas silver price often higher than the exchange rate of Shanghai silver dollars, China's silver reserves will naturally have the potential to overflow at any time. The result of the outflow will be a tightening of commercial credit in China. The reason is that the bank's issuance and deposits are based on silver reserves. If the silver reserves become increasingly weak, the bank will only adopt a tight credit operating policy in order to replenish its strength, absorbing cash from the interior to make up for the trend of diminishing reserves. Moreover, China is often in a trade deficit. Taking Shanghai as an example, the current monthly trade deficit reaches more than 20 million yuan. Usually, this consumption is mostly supported by increased foreign investment and credit. Once foreign banks lose confidence in Chinese merchants or stop investment activities, they will force Chinese merchants to withdraw cash or move their inventories. This is also a very important reason to stimulate Chinese merchants' banks to implement tightening policies. In this way, if the net export of China's silver reserves develops excessively, the tightening effect on domestic commercial credit is inevitable.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the American policy, is it possible for China's silver reserves to be exported in large quantities? As of now, the first thing to look at is how the American silver purchase policy will continue to proceed. The second is to see what policies the Chinese authorities will adopt. The third is to see how the war preparation situation in the Far East is. According to our observation, the large-scale export of silver reserves will harm both China and foreign countries, and banning silver exports is not necessarily a remedy. The reason for this is obvious. For example, since January of this year, the net export of silver has exceeded 70 million yuan. The net exports in July and August alone accounted for more than 40 million yuan. If this phenomenon continues (intensifies), it will inevitably shake credit and even lead to a further tightening panic. At that time, China's national economy will be even more exhausted, and even the interests of foreigners may be significantly affected. But on the other hand, if the Chinese authorities announce a ban on silver exports, will it immediately have a corresponding effect? Everyone knows that although China's silver reserves are sufficient, most of them are in the hands of the general public. For example, the Shanghai Chinese and foreign inventories each account for half, and the quantity is only 60 million yuan. The government's announcement of a ban on silver exports is not only difficult to implement, but also difficult to achieve results. Because on the one hand, smuggling is not easy to prevent. On the other hand, after the ban on silver exports, the exchange rate will rise day by day, and imported goods such as armaments will tend to increase in value, and financial difficulties are inevitable. Third, foreign investment in China will also depreciate as a result, and their resistance cannot be underestimated. These are all difficulties when banning silver exports.</p>
<p>According to the above, excessive silver exports will hinder Chinese and foreign commerce, and there are many difficulties in banning silver exports, which are not easily adopted by the authorities. We believe that if the government authorities can explain as early as possible that there is no intention to ban silver exports, the rumors from the outside will subside, the people's hearts can be stabilized, and the export of silver can naturally be expected to decrease.

<h3 id="e37">Disagreement within the Japanese Government <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prior to the London Naval Disarmament Preparatory Conference, the current issues are to propose fair and appropriate disarmament strategies, determine the technical and substantive details of these strategies, and decide when to notify the termination of the Washington Treaty. Regarding the first point, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy have reached a consensus on the principle of national defense security and the requirement for equal military preparedness. As for the termination of the Washington Treaty, the Navy has decided to terminate it before the conference, advocating a tough stance of immediately notifying the countries concerned or declaring this policy at home and abroad. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has consistently opposed the Navy's attitude, believing that issuing a termination notice before the conference would only harden the atmosphere of the conference and have a negative impact on the implementation of Japan's claims. Since the countries are expressing their claims at the preparatory conference, it can be determined whether Japan's claims can be passed and whether the conference next year can be resolved satisfactorily. Therefore, if it can be implemented, it would be more advantageous to use a new disarmament treaty to naturally eliminate the effect of the Washington Treaty. If there is a breakdown, the impact of the UK and the US's naval construction competition strategies and Japan's countermeasures on the international and economic situation cannot be determined today. We must pay attention to the progress of the preparatory conference and then carefully decide the extent. In addition, the ambassadors to the US Saito, the ambassador to France Sato, and the ambassador to Italy Matsushima, who are returning home, all strongly support the attitude of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from a broad perspective and are trying various suggestions. Therefore, Prime Minister Okada, who is known as a self-respecting person, is trying to reconcile the differences between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy to unify public opinion. Therefore, all parties are paying close attention to Prime Minister Okada's skills. (Telegraph from the 19th) American male and female movie stars</p>

<p>The responsibility for the suspension of negotiations lies with Japan</p>
<p>Easily angered and harbor aggressive intentions</p>
<p>The difference in road prices is still far away</p>
<p>(Moscow) The TASS news agency has released the following message here:</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the delegation from Manchuria attending the negotiations for the sale of the Middle East Railway has left Tokyo, and at the same time (the government of Manchukuo) has issued a statement intending to place the responsibility for the suspension of the negotiations on the Soviet Union, TASS has made many inquiries to the relevant authorities and can make the following report:</p>
<h3 id="e40">Dispute over selling price <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>In order to eliminate the source of conflict with Japan as soon as possible, the Soviet Union government notified the Japanese government on May 2, 1933, stating that the Soviet Union was willing to sell the Middle East Railway to Japan or (Manchukuo). Negotiations began in Tokyo on June 26, 1933. The Soviet delegation offered a price of 250 million gold rubles, which, according to the current exchange rate, would be 62.5 million Japanese yen. This price was based on various documents, railway property lists, property valuations, and records of the railway council. It is well known that the Manchurian delegation offered a counter-offer of 50 million Japanese yen in a nonchalant manner. In subsequent negotiations, in order to speed up the solution of the sale of the Middle East Railway, the Soviet delegation reduced the price to 200 million gold rubles as early as September 4, 1933.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Railway Staff Arrested <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Since then, the arrest of six important Soviet railway personnel of the Middle East Railway has had a provocative effect. The negotiations were suspended for six months. After the negotiations reopened, the Soviet Union government, faithful to its peaceful policies, finally expressed its willingness to make the most important concessions on February 26, 1934, namely, to reduce the selling price to 200 million Japanese yen, and to allow half of it to be paid in Japanese goods. The Soviet Union government's resolute step was intended to accommodate Japan and Manchukuo. It was unexpected that the other party was still persistent. On April 26, the Manchurian delegation offered a price of 100 million Japanese yen, of which 30 million yuan should be allocated as subsidies for the dismissal of railway staff and workers after the completion of the sale of the railway.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Hirota's counter-offer <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>On May 18, Foreign Minister Hirota expressed to Soviet Ambassador Youli Nieff that he was willing to do his best to accommodate the Soviet side and make further concessions. Youli Nieff then notified Hirota on May 25 that the Soviet Union government, in order to facilitate Hirota's mediation, was willing to reduce the price by another 10 million Japanese yen. On June 23, Hirota offered Youli Nieff 100 million Japanese yen, but the compensation for the dismissed employees would be borne by (Manchukuo). On June 28, Youli Nieff was ordered by the government to propose to Hirota again, stating that the Soviet Union was willing to make further concessions and reduce the selling price to 170 million Japanese yen. On July 23, Hirota again offered Youli Nieff 120 million Japanese yen, with compensation for dismissed employees to be borne separately by (Manchukuo). On July 30, Youli Nieff informed Hirota that the Soviet Union government was willing to complete the negotiations at a selling price of 160 million yuan. At the same time, in order to strive to accommodate Japan and Manchukuo, it agreed to pay two-thirds of the purchase price in goods (not half). The Soviet Union government at this point had full right to expect a satisfactory response to these terms and that the negotiations would be completed satisfactorily.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Final ultimatum <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>However, Hirota rejected this and expressed his negative reply in the form of a final ultimatum. Hirota and Youli Nieff continued negotiations on August 10, but there were no changes. Subsequently, on August 13, the chairman of the Manchurian delegation, Ohashi, visited Youli Nieff and said that he himself and the entire delegation would leave Tokyo and return to Manchukuo. The Japanese and Manchurian sides thus suspended the negotiations. After Hirota rejected the final proposal made by the Soviet Union government, the Japanese and Manchurian press launched an anti-Soviet Union propaganda campaign, distorting the truth of the negotiations in every possible way. Its purpose was obviously to put the Soviet Union's position in the negotiations under pressure.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Negotiation stalemate <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese side publicized that the stalemate in these negotiations was entirely due to the Soviet Union's (easy to anger). If we want to correctly assess the value of these reports, we only need to compare the concessions made by both sides. The Soviet Union reduced its demand from 250 million gold rubles (62.5 million Japanese yen) to 160 million Japanese yen (approximately 56 million gold rubles) during the negotiations, while the Japanese and Manchurian sides only increased their offer from 50 million Japanese yen to 120 million Japanese yen. This fact clearly shows that the Soviet Union has expressed its maximum goodwill and willingness to make concessions during the negotiations, while at the same time willing to accept huge sacrifices to promote security and peace in the Far East. However, the Japanese and Manchurian sides rejected the Soviet Union government's very accommodating amount of post-conditions in the form of a final ultimatum. At the same time, the Manchurian delegation left Tokyo with a sense of pride. Currently, Japanese and Manchurian newspapers are continuing their extremely shameless anti-Soviet Union propaganda campaign in order to make the Soviet Union's position on the sale of the Middle East Railway issue unfavorable. The Japanese and Manchurian authorities are using the old tricks of the autumn of 1933 to arrest a large number of Middle East Railway employees in Manchuria and use other repeatedly tried and tested provocative tricks. Therefore, this issue only allows one answer, that is, who is easily angered, harbors aggressive intentions, and bears the responsibility for the suspension of negotiations.

<p>Claiming to Prompt Russia to Reflect Sharply</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Union side announced the progress of its negotiations on the sale of the Middle East Railway, which is still under negotiation, and promoted the lack of sincerity of Japan and Manchukuo. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is extremely indignant about this matter, because Japan originally requested Foreign Minister Hirota to mediate the dispute, so the Foreign Minister considered the claims of both parties and proposed a final compromise. The Soviet Union rejected the compromise and adopted a seemingly ambiguous attitude. Its sincerity in the transfer is extremely questionable. Therefore, Vice Minister Ohashi of the (Manchukuo) Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to withdraw. If the Soviet Union could still show sincerity at this time, then Minister Ding Shiyuan could still act as a representative, and Vice Minister Ohashi could also travel east at any time. However, the Soviet Union did not come up with this plan, but only forced (Manchukuo) to make unreasonable concessions. It did not see the so-called final proposal of the Soviet Union side, deliberately delayed the negotiations, and even exposed the issues that are still in the middle of compromise. In order to cover up the ugly state of the country, and with regard to the other case of arresting Middle East Railway criminals plotting against the government, it said that it was putting pressure on the Middle East Railway. Such counter-propaganda attempts to make Japan and Manchukuo bear the responsibility for the suspension of negotiations. However, it is not known that this is a habitual method of the Soviet Union. Its ability to be completely insincere is enough to make the negotiations stalled. Today, anyone can know this. Therefore, by collecting the above-mentioned various situations, we should once again urge the Soviet Union to reflect sharply on its lack of sincerity. (Telegraph from the 19th)</p>

<p>(Changchun) Due to the suspension of the Middle East Railway transfer negotiations, the Ohashi representative and his party, who returned to Manchukuo from Tokyo, arrived here at 7:30 this morning. Representative Ohashi immediately went to the (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) to meet with Xie Jieshi and reported in detail on the progress of the negotiations and the circumstances of leaving Japan and returning to the country. After that, the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications joined the discussion on the attitude to be taken in the future, and then resolutely proceeded according to the following policy: (1) Whether the Soviet Union recognizes the Hirota Plan or proposes another plan that is close to the Hirota Plan. If it does not express the spirit of cooperation, it will not send representatives. (2) In the future, if the Soviet Union does not have a proposal for cooperation, then the negotiations will be deemed a rupture. (Manchukuo) will, as has been repeatedly stated, insist that there is no need to assume that responsibility. (3) After the rupture of the negotiations, according to the Feng-Russian Agreement, it will demand the implementation of Manchurian-Russian equal rights, and also demand to share responsibility for the accounting that is solely decided by the Soviet Union.

<p>(Tokyo) The Army has submitted its ordinary budget and general budget for the next year to the Ministry of Finance. At present, it is also deciding on the budget for temporary expenses and is discussing everything with the General Staff Headquarters. Regarding this matter, a provincial meeting will be convened in early next month to exercise the final decision. It is reported that the major requirements are as follows: (1) 100 million yen for equipment and preparation expenses; (2) 95 million yen for the Manchurian Incident; (3) 70-80 million yen for the enrichment of the air force; (4) 70-80 million yen for the second phase of the improvement of military preparations for the current situation. The total amount of temporary expenses required will reach 400 million yen. Therefore, adding it to the ordinary budget that has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance, the total amount of the Army's budget request for the next year seems to reach a huge amount of more than 600 million yen.

<p>The German Bremen Seaplane Base (Weisfarren) has proven to be very satisfactory after 18 months of testing. Today, the German airline decided to use this (man-made floating island as a permanent facility based on the South Atlantic seaborne air route. According to this decision, the company has set up another ship in Bremen. This (active island) is for pilots to land at sea when necessary to repair aircraft parts and add fuel. The island has an extremely wide deck, and there is plenty of room for aircraft to land. When taking off, high-pressure air is used to push the aircraft up. There is also a use, which is meteorological observation, which uses radio to report to flight personnel at any time. Now that this island is set up, flights to and from the Atlantic can be carried out year-round without interruption. Even if the structure of the aircraft progresses in the future, the function of this floating island can still be maintained, acting as a landing point on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and will not be affected by the climate on land.

<p>(Berlin) The German people flocked to the polling stations today, rushing to the forefront as if going to war. The polling stations opened at 8:00 a.m., but after dawn, bugles sounded in the streets, and the stormtroopers paraded in formation. The residents were all awakened and could not sleep soundly. A week ago, the Germans' attitude towards the referendum was very indifferent, but today it is different, because they have been stirred up by the Propaganda Minister's large-scale propaganda. When the stormtroopers paraded, they shouted (Hitler and what we want, vote yes). Party members drove through the city, waving swastika flags. There were also children gathering in teams, riding bicycles, blowing bugles, and shouting vote yes. When the polling station opened, men, women, old, and young entered in single file, led by military bands. Airplanes soared in the sky, unfolding swastika flags. At the same time, the radio station broadcast music and advised citizens to vote and fulfill their responsibilities. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th) It is expected that Hitler will win 80% to 90% of the vote in the referendum tomorrow, and the government is still working hard to promote the campaign. Recently, the son of the late President, Colonel Hindenburg, spoke on the radio, saying that his father recognized Hitler as his successor, so he hoped that all the German people would unanimously support this new president. The whole country is now suffering from the fanaticism of the referendum. Even airplanes are participating in this movement. The sound of airplanes rumbling is heard every day. Airplanes are flying low over the roofs, encouraging all the German people to go to the ballot box to vote. According to the German Aviation Association, all airplanes must be used for sports. The wings of the airplanes are all hung with swastika flags, soaring all day long throughout the country to awaken the people to go to vote. Tomorrow, ambulances will carry voters who cannot go out due to illness to the ballot box to vote. Only those who are seriously ill can be exempted. The Banking Association has issued a declaration, urging all members to vote (yes). Even children have begun to mobilize, as if all the German children will ask their father in the future, saying, Dad, what did you vote for on the referendum day? (Reuters dispatch from the 18th) The main roads and public squares of Berlin have been filled with activity in the past 24 hours. At first glance, you can see that the whole country is preparing for a very important event. Because the party's propaganda ended at noon yesterday, there were still tens of thousands of Brownshirts making a large-scale parade last night. They passed through Berlin, playing old German military music and singing heroic songs of the revolutionary era. This kind of tragic expression made the people's patriotic thoughts arise spontaneously, and it also greatly increased the people's enthusiasm for supporting Hitler. The crowds gathered in front of the Presidential Palace and the Prime Minister's residence, hoping to catch a glimpse of Mr. Xi's demeanor. When the cheers rang out, Mr. Xi would open the window and raise his hand to salute the crowd. Finally, the marchers held torches high and passed by in a line, all looking up and paying attention. Mr. Xi also leaned on the window and raised his hand. The crowd sang in harmony. The streets of Berlin were even more crowded this morning. Usually, Berlin workers go to the beach for leisure on Sunday in summer. Today, they have completely reversed their behavior. There is no gap in front of the Presidential Palace. There are even more people in the squares. The people started voting at 8:00 this morning and will continue until 6:00 tonight. The number of votes cast has been very large, especially in the working-class areas. All newspapers have made their last efforts to urge the people to fulfill their responsibilities this morning. The number of voters will exceed November 12 of last year. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th)</p>

<p>Following the attack on the Saar Police Chief Maschutius in Saarbrücken, the Saar administrative authorities seized documents from the offices of the "German Front" (German News Agency and Saar News Agency, etc.) proving various conspiracies. Recently, the Saar Administrative Commission, based on Article 13 of the May 20, 1933 order, stipulated that the following documents be submitted to the press for publication, and all newspapers must publish them uniformly. The document stated that the Saar Administrative Commission had submitted a draft order to the Saar People's Representative Assembly to solicit opinions. The draft order prohibits "volunteer work groups" from operating in the Saar and orders members of other groups to declare themselves to the police. According to recent searches of the "German Front" offices, the illegal activities of some groups are sufficient to endanger the Saar region and its people. The proposed order is a preliminary measure to prevent this danger. The Saar Administrative Commission has never interfered with Saar youth participating in "volunteer work groups" in Germany. If the same group operating in the Saar is only providing work for young people, the Administrative Commission is also unwilling to interfere. However, recent searches of the German Front offices have uncovered various documents proving that "volunteer work groups" recruit young people and send them to Germany, with the actual purpose of directly endangering the security of the Saar region, and proving that various groups in the Saar recruiting volunteers are incompatible with the legal status of the Saar region. Such groups are illegal, and the Administrative Commission has to ban them for this reason. (Havas, 18th)</p>

Therefore, when forming the cabinet, it appointed Mr. Goto, who had no party affiliation, to the important post of Minister of Home Affairs to prepare in advance. However, the opinions of Mr. Tokonami and others were that it was questionable how many members of their faction could win after the dissolution, and that it also had a significant impact on the establishment of the national defense budget. For this reason, they tried to avoid dissolution. Recently, the Seiyukai also took a tough stance on the surface, but the situation within the party was complicated, and they believed that dissolution would be unfavorable. Therefore, the atmosphere of avoiding it was quite strong. Now, during this season of political activity, the government, which aims for dissolution, the military, which deeply fears that the budget will not be established, and the political parties, which are deeply concerned about dissolution, will all launch various movements centered on the issue of dissolution. In the meantime, groups such as the Kokumin Domei, which is waiting for the opportunity to coordinate policies and the split of political parties, the Kuhara faction of the Seiyukai, and the Tomita faction of the Minseito, which hold a great unity movement, and the so-called political demarcation, all have opportunities for various movements to progress, and at the same time, major changes are expected to occur, which is worthy of attention.

<h3 id="e56">Embezzlement Case in Soviet Russia <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>A Major Case Occurs in the New Capital of Ukraine The embezzlement cases in various parts of the Soviet Union have been discovered one after another recently, and there is still no end in sight. An unusually large case has now been discovered in Kyiv, the new capital of the Ukrainian Republic. It was discovered that a few weeks ago, there was an unprecedented major embezzlement in the Kyiv Economic Committee, and after a court hearing, many people were sentenced to death. Later, there was another embezzlement case in the Bread Trust, and a large number of people were sentenced to long-term imprisonment. Today, another major embezzlement has been discovered. The reason for its occurrence is that various Soviet trusts and economic organizations have repeatedly requested compensation from the railway authorities due to excessive freight charges and losses caused by transportation negligence. For the sake of convenience, the railway authorities sometimes entrusted such requests to private individuals in order to win in court. This is against the law, and private individuals who undertake such cases often receive amazing commissions from the railway authorities. After the contents of the case were discovered, sixteen people have been arrested in Kyiv. It is said that they received illegal commissions of up to 1.8 million rubles last year. Among them, several people privately hid official documents from the Kyiv authorities and the court, in which they wrote fabricated verdicts of the Soviet court regarding such compensation for losses. In addition, many journalists have also been arrested because they were bribed by embezzlers and concealed the contents of the case.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japan-Manchukuo Cotton Association and the Japan-Manchukuo Merino Sheep Association are striving to study ways to develop Manchuria's industry in order to give full play to the founding function of the association. This time, the Cotton Association has formulated a cotton planting plan. As the first step, 1.2 million catties of cotton seeds have been shipped to Manchuria this year as the main force for cotton planting. It is now planned to ship 2 million catties to various places next year. In addition, the Merino Sheep Association has purchased 500 merino sheep of good quality and 4,000 merino sheep rams in Hailar, and decided to ship them to various parts of Manchuria from Niigata on September 1st to be raised jointly by the first, second, and third batches of immigrants handled by the Ministry of Colonial Affairs. It is planned that in the future, each immigrant will be responsible for raising one sheep, and every effort will be made to livestock, which is one of the planned policies.

<p>Vienna The stratospheric balloon that Europe has been eagerly awaiting to see landed in Yugoslavia at 9:00 tonight, ascending to 16,000 meters, failing to set a new record. Professor Coxius and his assistant Vanter Esde are both safe and sound. Today, dozens of telegrams from various places reported seeing the balloon or claiming that it had landed, but all were inaccurate. During the day, a wireless message was received from Professor Coxius, stating that he had reached a height of 22,000 meters, a new record for ascent. However, there are doubts about whether this telegram is genuine, because it was scheduled to use a code to send the message to prevent forgery, but the telegram was in plain text. The text read: (We have reached 22,000 meters, it is very cold, we are now in Czechoslovakia, the exact location is unknown, we can still stay in the air for five hours, the situation is very good). Newspapers were at a loss due to telegrams from various places. One report claimed that it had landed in Austria at 6:30 PM, another report said that it passed Belgrade at 10:15, and the two people in the balloon were apparently dead or had lost consciousness. The last report was at 11:00, when it had reached Yugoslavia. (Reuters, 19th) The balloon carrying Belgian scientists Coxius and Van der Esde, the capital of Yugoslavia, landed in Mosgasopoda, South Korea, at 9:30 last night. Cox and Fan are safe and sound. According to a news release from the South Korean Yavalatong News Agency, (This country’s balloon rising into the stratosphere landed at Rinaichi, 15 kilometers north of Gomchibetoroki Town, Mosgasopoda City, at 9:30 this morning. It is quite close to the border between South Korea and Hungary and Austria. Farmers in the Rinaichi area saw the balloon and went to rescue it before it landed. Coxius and Van der Esde threw down a rope, which was grabbed by the farmers, and the balloon was able to land safely. Nearby police rushed to the scene to tie the basket and balloon with cables. After Cox and Fan got off the ground, they went to the local elementary school principal's office to spend the night, looking extremely tired. This morning, the two took various instruments from the basket and went to Gomchibetoroki Town. According to Mr. Kao's statement to the representative of the Lubliana State Radio Broadcasting Station, the height he and his assistant reached was 16,000 meters. The results obtained from this ascent are extremely satisfactory, etc. A party-led car in Mosgasopoda City will provide transportation for Coxius. It is estimated that Mr. Kao will go to Chaigleberg or Lubliana City in the middle of the month. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>(London) The British and French Aviation Departments are currently negotiating to allow Imperial Airways aircraft to fly over the Paris-Marseille section of the air route. If this move is successful, the journey from Croydon Aerodrome in London to India, the Far East, and Cape Town can all be achieved by plane. The main obstacle to the current compromise is that the French Aviation Department insists on pooling the income and then dividing it, while the British Aviation Department considers this proposal unfair. According to diplomatic observers, if the French aviation authorities do not provide British aircraft with the convenience of passage on reasonable terms, Britain may not allow French airline aircraft to pass through India to Vietnam and through Rhodesia to Madagascar in Africa.

<p>(Washington) Today, it is widely rumored in political circles here that Mr. O'Connor, Director of the Currency Bureau, will be appointed Director of the Federal Reserve Bank. The former Director, Mr. Blank, resigned on Wednesday. Mr. O'Connor was appointed by the former Treasury Secretary Woodin, and there have been rumors of his resignation for several months, but they have not materialized. At the beginning of his tenure, the current Treasury Secretary Morgenthau originally planned to replace all important positions in the Treasury Department with new people. However, Mr. O'Connor has been quite cooperative with all parties in the government, so he has not been replaced. Some observers believe that after Blank's resignation, the Treasury Department will undergo major changes. (Guomin, 18th) (Washington) General Johansen, Director of the U.S. Recovery Administration, has denied rumors that he will resign or be asked to resign. He said that President Roosevelt has insisted that he remain Director of the Recovery Administration.

(Guomin, 18th) (Washington) Agriculture Secretary Wallace today attacked government subsidies for merchant ships. In a letter to the House Merchant Marine Committee, Mr. Wallace strongly opposed the continued economic possibility of the tens of millions of dollars in subsidies that the government gives to foreign mail. Mr. Wallace believes that domestic resources should be developed now, so a portion of foreign trade can be transported by foreign merchant ships. Representatives of the transportation industry here are deeply afraid of Mr. Wallace's attack, but it is a sign that the government leader is directly attacking the existing subsidies. They all believe that the next Congress will seriously decide on a permanent policy for foreign mail subsidies. This policy is likely to be unfavorable to transportation companies. President Roosevelt is also paying close attention to this matter.

<p>Important Consultations Held at the Foreign Minister's Official Residence</p>
<p>Centered on Naval Disarmament Japan must prepare appropriate countermeasures before the expiration of the Washington-London Naval Treaty in 1936 to cope with the diplomatic changes. Especially before the preparatory meeting for the naval disarmament conference in October this year, she must make full preparations. Therefore, in the name of refreshing diplomacy, Foreign Minister Hirota came forward to summon ambassadors to important European and American countries to return home for instructions, and at the same time discuss coping strategies. Those who have already returned to Tokyo include Ambassador to the United States Saito Hiroshi, Ambassador to France Sato Haruo, Ambassador to Italy Matsushima Hajime, and Counselor of the Embassy in Manchukuo Tani Masaki, etc. On the afternoon of the 9th, Hirota summoned the above diplomats at his official residence in Kasumigaseki, and Vice Minister Shigemitsu Aoi, the new Director of the Investigation Department Kurihara Tadashi (former Consul General in Tianjin), and the directors and section chiefs of various bureaus of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs attended the meeting. Although this is not a formal meeting, the actual relationship is very important, because the main task of the Okada Cabinet is to focus on diplomacy, and the first task in diplomatic strategy is to break through Japan's current international isolation. Therefore, the significance of this meeting of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is particularly noteworthy. At the beginning of the meeting, Ambassador to the United States Saito first reported on the situation in the United States, especially the United States' proposal to reduce naval armaments and the effectiveness of "Moral Diplomacy" in the general society and diplomatic circles in the United States. Then, Ambassador to France Sato reported on the situation in Europe, especially France's views on naval issues. Tani Masaki then presented his proposal to reorganize the institutions in "Manchukuo". How the specific results will be is still not fully understood. Although this meeting itself is not an organization that decides the highest strategy, these people are indeed at the highest level in diplomatic technology, and their opinions are also sufficient to influence Japan's entire diplomatic strategy and affect international relations in the Far East.</p>
<p>Although they did not have any specific resolutions, there are two very important plans. The first is to adhere to Japan's claim of military equality and break the past proportionalism in the naval disarmament conference. The first step is to expand Japan's foreign propaganda, saying that it has no ambition to close the doors of the Far East and no intention to seize the Philippines. This matter had achieved considerable results when Hirota and Hull exchanged documents, but the Amano statement on April 17 caused great doubts. Therefore, it must be done again. The most concrete manifestation is to increase foreign propaganda expenses, which amount to approximately 9 million yen, to set up a special intelligence bureau in the United States, and also to set up specialized libraries in New York and Paris. The propaganda materials are completely supplied by Japan. The second is to quickly find a way to win over the United States, because the confrontation between Japan and the United States is not very serious, and the entire raw silk market is in the United States. This can be used to break the alliance between Britain and the United States. Once an incident occurs against the Soviet Union, it can also obtain material and international political support.</p>
<p>The next is the reform plan of the institutions in "Manchukuo". Originally, Japan implemented the so-called trinity system for puppet organizations, and the Commander of the Kwantung Army also served as the Governor of Kwantung Prefecture and the Ambassador to "Manchukuo". In fact, the bureaucrats under the Governor of Kwantung Prefecture and the staff of the embassy, and the middle-level cadres of the army often opposed each other. The commander has also become a puppet. In addition, the infighting between the various factions of the army under the Kwantung Army Headquarters is also very fierce. For example, the Chief of Staff and the Deputy Chief of Staff have different opinions. Therefore, the current Japanese militarism is no longer as strong and unified as before.</p>
<p>The opinion of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is to change the current trinity system for "Manchukuo" into a dual system of army and diplomacy. In the past, the special enterprises belonging to "Mantetsu" were supervised by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In the future, they will be directly supervised by the Prime Minister of the Cabinet. The Governor of Kwantung Prefecture will be changed to the Governor of Kwantung Prefecture. The powers of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs will be revoked. The plenipotentiary ambassador will be changed to a purely diplomat and will not concurrently manage judicial matters such as extraterritoriality. The name of extraterritoriality will be returned to the puppet country. However, the plenipotentiary ambassador is still concurrently held by the military commander to seek unity between military, political, and diplomatic affairs. This is the claim of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Colonial Affairs believes that the Governor of Kwantung Prefecture should not be abolished, but the army still feels that the powers are not concentrated and advocates setting up a unitary control organization to be completely handled by the military commander, concentrating military, political, diplomatic, economic, and other aspects in one supreme organization in order to proceed with everything in order and achieve the effect of control. In short, Japan's diplomacy adopts an active policy. Although there is internal disharmony, it is very consistent externally and very vicious. I don’t know how its neighbor, who suffers the most, should deal with it. (August 14th in Tokyo)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Russian Goods Sell Well in North China <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Imported and transshipped by the Anglo-Russian Trading Company. Failure to sign a trade treaty results in tax revenue losses for our nation. Tianjin correspondence: Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, international relations have improved considerably. Officials and civilians alike, due to their shared oppression under Japanese influence, harbor considerable sympathy towards Russia. Consequently, certain matters between China and Russia that lack formal agreements are proceeding smoothly. For instance, the widely discussed trade treaty has yet to materialize. During the period of the Soviet Union's second five-year economic plan, when sacrifices were being made, the signing of a trade treaty was not deemed crucial. For China, however, lax customs controls and ineffective maritime restrictions have made the country a final destination for goods. Taking North China as an example, the influence of Russian goods, surpassing even that of British and American products, is second only to that of Japanese goods. This is because the Chinese, both high and low, are completely focused on Japan, neglecting this newly re-established friendly nation. As a result, Russian goods have been able to seize the opportunity to expand their sales. The reason for their brisk sales is due to low costs, the absence of storefronts, covert promotion, and street-side sales. Moreover, as state-owned enterprises prioritize practical results, profit and loss are not a major concern. Therefore, in the past six months, the abundance of Russian goods in Tianjin and major cities and towns in North China is attributable to this. However, although Russian goods are sold widely, few are aware of it. This is because, with no Sino-Soviet trade treaty in place, the Soviet Union fears that its goods will be confiscated if discovered by customs. Even if entry is somehow arranged, heavy taxes would be levied. Therefore, a Anglo-Russian Trading Company has been specially established in London. While the name suggests a joint British-Russian venture, it is actually a disguised organization of the Soviet Union's State Trade Bureau, with the British merely employed as managers. Registered with the British government, this company serves as a trading mechanism during the period when a trade treaty with China has not been restored. The Soviet Union's dumping of goods in China is carried out through this company, which distributes them to Chinese brokers for secret sales. Customs inspections only recognize them as British goods, taxed according to most-favored-nation status, unaware that they are actually Russian goods. The largest categories of goods shipped to North China include timber, printed cotton cloth, kerosene, agricultural tools, ginseng, deer antlers, fur, and matches. Among these, ginseng was originally a specialty of Northeast China. In recent years, the Soviet Union has cultivated it using scientific methods in the Maritime Province, yielding substantial harvests. Its composition is quite deceptive, allowing it to be sold in China's interior. The timber sector has almost achieved a monopoly in North China. Most recently, there have been plans to recruit people to sell newspapers. The newspapers are divided into two types: one is raw paper, unprinted, intended to be imported under the guise of Canadian paper; the other is already printed, imported under the guise of British and American newspapers. While the import of raw paper only affects the market, the import of printed newspapers, from a socialist country, with its past doctrines and theories, naturally retains a certain presence. The harm caused by readers purchasing and reading them is not insignificant. The Soviet Union's intention in selling old newspapers is also not without purpose. Currently, recruitment of brokers is underway, but no agreement has been reached. The Anglo-Russian Trading Company in Tianjin, located on Hai Avenue in the British concession, serves as the trade center for North China. Its organization is extremely simple, but its responsibilities for promoting sales are enormous. All North China's products that can be used as raw materials for Soviet processed goods are purchased by this company, ostensibly for export to England, but actually shipped to Russia. Therefore, while the Sino-Soviet trade treaty remains unsigned, this represents a huge loss of tax revenue for our side. (17th)</p>

<p>Various sectors express condolences to the soldiers of the 87th Division. Fuzhou correspondence: Since the beginning of this month, Red bandits, disturbing the lower reaches of the Min River and attempting to raid the provincial capital, have launched three successive attacks.

All sectors of the provincial capital believe that Fuzhou's security is due to the courageous suppression by Wang Jingjiu, commander of the 87th Division of the Army, and his troops. In addition to the provincial and county party departments sending telegrams of condolence, gentry and business leaders initiated the establishment of a condolence association on the 11th. On the 13th, they raised 10,000 yuan in cash, purchasing medicines, food, and daily necessities, which were sent to various defense lines on the 15th to reward the soldiers. The Red Cross and Red Swastika societies have scheduled teams to go to the battlefields on the 15th to bury the corpses. Furthermore, during the wartime period, the military institutions of the Gendarmerie Regiment and the Garrison Department interrogated bandit spies captured in the rear. Chen Xiangrong, Wang Zefan, Cai Mengyuan, Zheng Zubo, Lin Yile, Lin Chun, Yu Liang, Pan Zuozhen, and Chen Maozhang, whose crimes were deemed serious, were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on the 14th. There are also dozens of suspicious monks detained by the Public Security Bureau. (Most of these monks are from the Ningyang Chongfu and other temples outside the northeast gates, who fled into the city to escape the bandits.) They have been housed in the Douzhan Shengfo Temple at the foot of Ping Mountain to prevent them from causing trouble outside. As for the bandits who fled to Lianluo, the authorities have also dispatched troops to pursue them. They arrived in Pandu on the 13th and are expected to reach the border of Luoyuan tomorrow to engage the bandits. (14th) Sichuan Bandits are Inhumane.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Exploitation of Farmers and Laborers is Cruel <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>No distinction between old and young; grain must be paid. All income of farmers and laborers is looted by the bandits. Chengdu aviation news: Since the encirclement and suppression of the Red bandits in northern Sichuan by the large army, the counties that had been captured have been successively recovered, and they are gradually approaching extinction. Although the bandits are doing their best to make a final struggle at this time, they will ultimately not be able to survive due to internal division and lack of food and ammunition. Since the total offensive launched by the Fifth and Sixth Route Armies on the 5th of this month, there have been dozens of major and minor battles. All the strategically important passes of Wanyuan, such as Yuanjia Mountain, Damian Mountain, and Laoyingzhai, have been recaptured. The bandits are increasingly helpless. The reporter recently visited a senior military officer, who informed him about the situation of bandit suppression at the front, and said that it is expected that the bandits may flee into the Daba Mountains. At that time, even if the bandits concentrate their forces and rely on the natural dangers of the mountains, the official army will implement a blockade policy, encircling the mountains layer by layer, and the bandits will be in a cauldron, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them. He also showed the reporter two items obtained by the front-line troops from the Red bandits, namely the Grain Regulations of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Province and the Tax Regulations of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Province, which have not been seen by outsiders. The extraordinary severity of the taxes and miscellaneous levies in the bandit area and their means of exploitation are truly extreme. The bandit's Grain Regulations are especially severe. The farmers in the bandit area work hard all year round, and all the surplus they earn is plundered by the Red bandits. The Communist Party, which verbally advocates the interests of workers and peasants, exploits farmers and workers to such an extent that it has long lost the sympathy of the masses and is in a cauldron. The bandit's Grain and Tax Regulations are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Grain Regulations <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>(Article 1) Soviet public officials and the Red Army must have a means of guaranteeing their livelihoods.

This is called Soviet public grain. (Article 2) The quantity range of this public grain is determined by the amount of grain that each adult, elderly, and child has enough to eat and wear each year, with some surplus.

(Article 3) If the land is entirely dry land, only corn, wheat, beans, or miscellaneous grains may be paid, and may be paid in two seasons: three-fifths in the autumn harvest and two-fifths in the spring harvest. (The number of loads of corn is calculated based on the net amount of rice corn). (Article 4) The distribution of public grain is as follows: 40% for Soviet public officials and transportation teams, 40% for the Red Army to eat, and 20% for social insurance. (Article 5) Public grain is centralized by district, and warehouses are set up in each district for storage. The Soviet regularly sends people to guard them. (Article 6) The size and weight of the sheng and dou of public grain are as follows: each jin is 20 liang, each sheng is 100 liang, which is 5 jin, each dou is 50 jin, and two dou is one load.

<h3 id="e85">Tax Regulations <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>(Article 1) This Bureau, in order to implement the (Central) progressive tax rate and based on the resolution of this (Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Province), aims to increase and consolidate the interests of workers and peasants themselves and develop the social economy, and is named the (Sichuan-Shaanxi Provincial Bureau of Workers and Peasants Taxation).

<p>The purpose is to purchase drought-resistant crop seeds. The Rural Cooperative Association decides to handle agricultural loans first. Nanchang correspondence: The drought disaster in Jiangxi Province is severe and in urgent need of relief. Reports of disasters from various counties have become commonplace. Currently, written and telegraphic requests for loans to purchase seeds for drought-resistant crops are pouring in like snowflakes. On the 10th, the Duchang County government telegraphed the provincial government, requesting the issuance of 1,500 dan of buckwheat, 100 dan of radish seeds, 2,000 dan of barley, and 1,000 dan of wheat. On the 13th, Jiujiang County telegraphed, requesting a loan of 40,000 yuan to purchase 1,500 dan of millet and buckwheat.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Wu Peifu's Life <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Looking back, it's pitiful that the singing and dancing have vanished. Now, it's not like the days in Luoyang. Beijing correspondence: The recent life of Wu Peifu, the Fuwei General who is living in seclusion in the old capital, is rarely known to outsiders. According to Wu's associates, the details are as follows: Since Wu Fuwei settled in Shijin Garden in the eastern city, old friends have been visiting, and the courtyard is quite lively. Even party and government figures who come to Beijing on official business, whether they know him or not, often drive to visit. Huang Fu and Wu have a sworn brotherhood, calling Wu "Second Brother." Others call him "Commander" or "Second Gentleman." Wu receives them all cordially, but excludes Japanese and those in Western attire. When Wu mentions the precarious state of the country, he often shows anger and bristles with indignation. Wu does not practice Buddhism but venerates Taoism, advocating the unification of the three religions to govern politics with religion. He once wrote to a certain magnate, expounding on this idea. The magnate replied in a letter, with gentle language. Wu remains arrogant and often engages in lengthy talks with guests, insisting on his own theories, much like a lecture. Guests who visit him rarely receive return visits. Since moving to Beijing, he has only returned a visit to Zhang Taiyan once. During their meeting, Zhang and Wu exchanged greetings. Zhang spoke in the Yuyao dialect, while Wu spoke in the local Penglai accent. A translator was needed to relay their words, which was quite amusing. Looking at Wu's life as a whole, he has never been intimidated by anyone, except for Madam Zhang. Whenever Wu is enraged, a word from his wife can resolve it. If Madam Zhang commands something, he cannot bear to disobey her. Wu has strange and eccentric people sitting around him, some skilled in swordsmanship, others able to swallow gold and spit fire. The most notable is an old man from Sichuan, over a hundred years old, who never leaves Wu's side, and a great swordsman, Peng Taiyi (Peng Jiazhen, who assassinated Liangbi in 1911, is his son). His sword light is like silk, eerie and frightening. Madam Zhang said to Wu, "You are addicted to this path, what more can I say? But placing them among family banquets will arouse suspicion among outsiders. Be careful not to do so." Wu agreed and moved the old man outside. Although Wu has nothing to do, he holds many positions. He is the president of the Beijing Red Swastika Society and the New Salvation Church. Every charitable hall has Wu's handwritten couplets and lists Wu as a standing director. He also established the Zhengyi Hall, serving as the president himself, with three branches: the Charity Hall, the Public Hall, and the Repair Hall. Wu is over sixty years old, but he is still vigorous. He gets up at dawn, strolls in the courtyard, waters flowers, and watches fish, contentedly. He keeps many goldfish, of various shapes and colors. Wu attentively counts them every morning, without tiring. It is also heard that Wu's living expenses, when he first came to Beijing, were supported by Zhang Xueliang with 4,000 gold per month due to family ties. After Zhang resigned and traveled to Europe, the funds were changed to be allocated monthly by a certain association in Beijing, listed under military expenses. It is rumored that Wu was appointed as a high-level consultant, but this is not the case. Wu's actual income is only 2,800 gold per month, so he often shows embarrassment. Someone told a certain important person, asking for more. The important person sighed and said, "I also know about this gentleman's situation, but the rules cannot be violated. During the New Year's holidays, we should give him a supplementary allowance to match the original amount." When Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi came to Beijing last time, it is said that he gave Wu 5,000 gold. Wu is diligent in writing, but he does not paint easily unless he is in the mood. When a certain gentleman returned south, he asked for his calligraphy. Without hesitation, Wu picked up his pen and wrote a couplet: "Looking back, it's pitiful that the singing and dancing have vanished. Now, it's not like the days in Luoyang." Could it be that he cannot overcome the feeling of his own life?</p>
<p>Mack 6,000 dan, Yifeng County telegraphed on the 15th, requesting a loan of 60,000 yuan to purchase seeds. Yugan County telegraphed on the 10th, requesting a seed preparation fee. Xinjian County submitted a request on the 15th for a loan of 5,000 dan of buckwheat and 3,000 dan of broad beans. Dexing County telegraphed on the 16th, requesting 3,000 yuan to purchase 500 dan of buckwheat. Wuning County telegraphed on the 13th, requesting 13,000 dan of buckwheat, 2,600 dan each of wheat and barley, 1,400 dan of peas, and 100 dan each of mustard and radishes. Yujiang County telegraphed on the 12th, requesting a loan of 5,300 yuan to purchase 500 dan each of buckwheat and millet, 400 dan of autumn beans, and 10 dan of sesame. Fenyi County Magistrate Qiu telegraphed the Department of Construction, requesting the issuance of 600 dan of buckwheat and 400 dan of soybeans. Fengxin County telegraphed on the 11th, requesting the purchase of 1,500 shi of buckwheat, 100 dan of radishes, 2,000 dan of barley, and 1,000 dan of wheat. Xinyu County Magistrate Liu telegraphed the provincial government on the 9th, requesting the issuance of 500 dan of buckwheat. Gaoan County Magistrate Peng telegraphed on the 8th, stating that he has sent personnel to the province to request the issuance of 200 dan each of buckwheat and broad beans. Yushan County Magistrate Wang Zhenhuan requested a loan of 10,000 yuan to purchase 5,000 shi of buckwheat from neighboring provinces. The total amount of loans and seed purchase fees requested by the other counties is no less than one million yuan. Whether the provincial government and the Rural Cooperative Committee have the capacity to do so is a question. Even if they can raise this large sum, buckwheat, broad beans, sesame, peas, and millet were only secondary products in the past, and very few were kept for seeds. How can they gather such a large batch of seeds in a short time? This is even more difficult than raising funds. The authorities are still spending a lot of effort in planning this matter. However, disaster assessment personnel have been dispatched to various counties and are required to compile and report the details of the drought disaster in each county, the amount of crop failure, and the type and quantity of drought-resistant crops needed, and submit them to the Rural Cooperative Committee, which will borrow 300,000 yuan from the Four Provinces Farmers Bank to specifically handle agricultural loans for the purchase of drought-resistant crop seeds. It is heard that the Rural Cooperative Association has decided to handle agricultural loans first in more than 30 key disaster areas, with Jiujiang, Hukou, and other eleven counties as the first batch. After this batch is completed, a second batch will be handled. More than 20 loan officers have also been dispatched separately. In addition, agricultural loans will also be carried out in other counties in a cooperative manner to provide relief. The National Economic Commission has allocated 500,000 yuan to Jiangxi Province for the rural cooperative circulation fund, which has not yet been used. In the future, it may be used as a new force to relieve disaster-stricken farmers. (August 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Hong Kong Government Severely Punishes Japanese Residents <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reported on the 14th that the Hong Kong government has recently implemented various regulations that are quite strict, and those who violate these regulations are not shown any leniency. As a result, Japanese have become the target of the police authorities. In seven days, more than ten people have been arrested, mostly for not having travel permits, not registering their identity, operating businesses privately, or for women who have been ordered to be deported but remain in the area. The Hong Kong government believes that they are defying the police authorities, while the 900,000 Chinese are never treated so harshly. Only the few thousand Japanese residents are treated as a thorn in their side. Restaurants opened by Japanese are frequently inspected, and other regulations such as hygiene, construction, and other regulations are punished if they slightly displease the authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Xia County in Southern Shanxi is Completely Submerged <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The water is more than ten feet deep on flat ground. The four streets are submerged and nothing remains. Taiyuan Correspondence: Since the beginning of summer in Shanxi Province, there has been a severe drought, followed by an epidemic, and recently, hail has caused a disaster. According to the reports from various counties obtained by the Provincial Relief Association, the disaster area in the province has reached more than half, and there are about 500,000 disaster victims who are crying for food and urgently need relief. The relief measures are currently being discussed between the provincial government and the relevant departments such as the China Relief Commission. However, Xia County, near Anyi in southern Shanxi, suddenly suffered the tragedy of the city being flooded by river water on the night of the 11th of this month. Although there are no accurate statistics on the extent of the loss, the severity of the disaster can be imagined. After the event, the county magistrate of the county, Zhang Hongyong, telegraphed to the provincial government to report the matter. The original telegram read: "On the night of the 11th of this month (true date), at three or four o'clock, there was a heavy rain and a flash flood. The people were fast asleep when the Baisha River broke its banks. The water was so strong that it rushed straight to the east pass, and in an instant, it collapsed the east gate tower and flooded the city. The four streets were submerged and nothing remained. The water was more than ten feet deep on flat ground. Most of the shops and houses collapsed. There were no houses left in the west street, north street, southwest street, and northwest street. The people are homeless, crying and wailing. The disaster is unprecedented. The county magistrate immediately allocated civilians to block the breach and supervised the staff to rescue the people who were submerged. He also gathered local gentry to raise funds to provide immediate relief. The other villages that reported the disaster and the number of deaths, as well as the loss of property, are still difficult to know at this time because the water has not decreased. In addition to sending personnel to investigate separately, all the extremely heavy disaster situations in the county are respectfully telegraphed to request the dispatch of personnel to the county to investigate in detail and raise funds for relief to save the lives of the people. I am very anxious to wait for orders." Sun Huanlun, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, submitted the original telegram to the provincial government meeting on the morning of the 14th, asking the committee members to discuss emergency relief measures, and to consult with Wang Ping, the director of the Department of Finance, and telegraph Zhou Yuxuan, the county magistrate of Anyi, to quickly rush to investigate and report. The provincial government then resolved to first order the county government of the county, the Civil Affairs Department, and the Provincial Relief Association to investigate and report in various ways for verification. According to traffic news, the area is currently flooded and traffic has been cut off, and the disaster is indeed very serious. (15th)</p>

<p>Autonomy Not Yet Completed; Tax Collection Must Not Violate the Late Leader's Instructions.</p>
<p>Wuxi News: Wuxi's various public organizations, recently citing the National Reconstruction Outline of the late Premier, jointly telegraphed to the national and provincial governments, appealing for an order to halt the urban land price declaration process, stating: (Nanjing Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, National Government Chairman Lin, Executive Yuan Premier Wang, Legislative Yuan Speaker Sun, Minister of Finance Kong, Minister of Interior Huang, Nanchang Military Affairs Committee Chairman Jiang, Zhenjiang Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Chen, Civil Affairs Department Director Yu, Finance Department Director Zhao, revered sirs, Jiangsu province's land has only just been surveyed and measured. According to Article 8 of the late Premier's National Reconstruction Outline, it is still the period of political tutelage, where the government dispatches personnel to assist the people in preparing for self-governance. It has not yet reached the stage of complete autonomy. However, recently a separate set of measures has been promulgated, abruptly planning to first start land price declarations in the cities of Nantong and Wuxi, with a deadline. Article 16 of the measures clearly stipulates that after the completion of land price declarations, the county government should immediately begin collecting land price tax and land appreciation tax. Upon investigation, land price declaration and the collection of land price tax are mentioned in Articles 10 and 11 of the late Premier's National Reconstruction Outline, which are clearly stipulated after Article 9, regarding complete autonomy, and the period before Article 8 is designated as the period of political tutelage. The document states, "When a county begins to create self-governance, it must first determine the price of all privately owned land in the county. The method is for the landowners to declare it themselves, and the local government will levy taxes based on the declared price and can purchase the land at any time at the declared price. After this valuation, if the land increases in value due to political improvements or social progress, then the benefits should be shared by all the people of the county, and the original owner should not privatize them. Land revenue, land price appreciation, public land production, mountain, forest, river, and lake resources, mineral and waterpower profits all belong to the local government and are used to operate the affairs of the local people, and to nurture the young, care for the elderly, aid the poor, provide disaster relief and medical care, and all kinds of public needs," etc. These are the necessary conditions for creating self-governance. Land revenue and land price appreciation should be shared by all the people of the county and used to operate the affairs of the local people. The original intention is to be used exclusively for county self-governance, and it is also necessary to implement and initiate county self-governance before determining the price of all privately owned land in the county, which is declared by the landowners, and taxes are levied based on the declared price. Clearly, this power and ability is entrusted to local self-governance, and land prices must actually increase due to political improvements and social progress before additional appreciation tax can be collected. The meaning is very clear. It is feared that it is not appropriate for the government during the period of political tutelage to borrow or change this abruptly, increasing the burden on the local people. Therefore, Article 5 of Chapter 2 of the draft County Self-Governance Law formulated by the Legislative Yuan stipulates that matters of county self-governance include all county land administration matters, and Article 44 of Chapter 7 stipulates that county finances include all county local tax revenues, which seems to be based on Articles 10 and 11 of the late Premier's National Reconstruction Outline, especially clearly demonstrating that the land in Jiangsu Province is still being surveyed, and abruptly ordering the cities of Nantong and Wuxi to immediately conduct land price declarations. Whether it has been confirmed that the cities of the two counties have reached a stage of complete autonomy seems to need to be clearly stipulated and granted the power of self-governance. Even if land price declarations are conducted, they should also be classified as self-governance. Otherwise, the completion of local self-governance will take time. According to Article 25 of the Provisional Constitution, the people have no obligation to pay taxes unless according to law. Abruptly issuing provincial regulations without any basis in central law attempts to change the late Premier's instructions. Is this appropriate for political tutelage? We, the directors, serve the local area and dedicate ourselves to the party and the country, and we dare not accept such orders, risking local opposition. Moreover, Wuxi relies on industry and commerce as its lifeline. In recent years, the market has been depressed, and factories have closed down eight or nine out of ten. Every month, the bankruptcy court auctions off assets, with repeated price reductions, but no one pays attention. The decline in land prices can be imagined. Many people in the middle and lower classes are unemployed. At a time when the drought is severe and the local area is suffering, we have long received the government's sympathy and have already issued orders for relief. We dare to submit this report, humbly requesting review and verification, and quickly ordering a halt to this, to avoid violating the late leader's instructions and to conform to political tutelage. With utmost trepidation, Qian Jihou, Wu Shimei, directors of the Wuxi County Public Funds and Property Management Office; Yang Shoumei, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce; Cai Wenxin, Qian Jihou, Chen Zuolin, Wu Shimei, standing committee members; Qian Zhongliang, head of the first district; Tao Guanshi, Du Puchen, Gu Hongzhi, Deng Yufen, Wang Jinghui, Tang Jiyun, Yang Hanxi, Wu Xiangqing, Hua Chun'an, Chen Zikuan, Zhou Guanxiong, Shao Mufang, Shi Binzhang, Jiang Zumin, Xu Songru, Hua Ti, Liu Hongkun, Cheng Yuming, Yu Xiangxian, Wen Qizhi, Chen Shaoqin, Miao Dongchen, Cai Huchen, Zhao Zixin, Cai Jihui, Chen Han, Xie Shuinan, Shen Chucai, Feng Yaoxing, Cheng Jingtang, Yao Ganshi, Xu Jingyuan, Qin Yuanzhao, Zhu Jianshan, Zhou Zhaochang, and all 267 deputy township heads and supervisory committee members kowtow in unison.) ————————Songjiang</p>
<h3 id="e91">Beijing Natives Request Strict Handling of Corruption in Tax Collection <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The case of Songjiang falsely claiming tax exemptions and manipulating grain transport has been widely reported after being exposed by citizens and reported by the director of the education bureau, attracting the attention of Songjiang residents. It is now learned that the natives of Songjiang in Beijing also sent a telegram the other day requesting a thorough investigation by the provincial government. The telegram was led by Gao Gengzuo, the editing section chief of a certain department of the Central Party Headquarters. The wording was quite serious. The original text is extracted as follows: "Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Chen, Finance Department Director Zhao, esteemed sirs, Songjiang County Magistrate Jin Tigan colluded with Finance Section Chief Che Zhao and Tax Collection Director Ye Zongcheng to embezzle more than 100,000 yuan from tax exemptions and grain transport. After being reported by citizens and exposed by the Party Headquarters, they imprisoned Tax Collection Director Ye Zongcheng, who was addicted to opium, in the county government, hoping that his addiction would flare up and he would die, in order to silence him. Newspapers have reported this, and those who hear it are shocked. If the county magistrate is truly innocent and conscientious, why would he allow him to hide and deceive the Finance Department? His collusion and embezzlement are obvious. Furthermore, on the day the case was exposed, he shamelessly issued a notice, using clever words to shirk responsibility and deceive the people, as if he could cover the sky with one hand. If this kind of greedy and shameless person is still allowed to remain in office, plotting to eliminate evidence and escape the law, not only will Songjiang be plunged into darkness, but the clean and honest governance of Jiangsu Province will also be tarnished by these people. Because this matter concerns our hometown, Liangzuo and others cannot remain silent. Therefore, we especially send you, esteemed sirs, the relevant newspapers related to this case, jointly requesting that the county magistrate Jin Tigan be immediately dismissed from his post, and that Che Zhao and Ye Zongcheng be brought to the province and severely punished according to the law. Furthermore, the revenue from the land tax in Songjiang County has never been made public, providing an opportunity for those in charge to engage in private gain and corruption, resulting in long-standing abuses that cannot be investigated. Corrupt local bullies all regard this as a source of profit. The discovery of the manipulation of tax exemptions and grain transport is just the tip of the iceberg. We request that you order the public organizations of the county to organize a clearing committee to thoroughly clean up the accounts since the beginning of the Republic of China and to stipulate measures to supervise and crack down on tax collection directors in the future, so that national taxes can be clarified once and for all. The local area is fortunate, and the Party and the country are fortunate. Songjiang Natives in Beijing, Gao Liangzuo, Lu Shunong, Xu Weisheng, Gu Liquan, Feng Liangkai, and others kowtow in unison.

<p>At 6:00 AM on the 17th, Gu Guoxiang, a soldier from the 8th team of the Shanghai Municipal Guard Corps, traveled by bicycle from Shanghai via the Xiangzhen Motor Road to Jiading. When passing through the town, he went to the Sanxing Rice Shop to buy cigarettes. A dispute arose over the price. The shop owner, Qian Wenbin, who had previously served as the head of the local county guard regiment, noticed that there had been several theft cases in the vicinity recently. He saw that Gu was wearing a Guard Corps uniform but had no badge, and that he was traveling alone for a long distance early in the morning, abandoning public transportation. He thought that his appearance was suspicious, so he questioned him in detail. Gu immediately started cursing loudly. When others tried to dissuade him, they were also cursed at. As it was the time of the market, onlookers were greatly displeased that he was insulting others. They shouted to hit him, and a crowd gathered to beat him. Qian stepped forward to stop them, intending to take him to the Nanxiang Public Security Branch. Gu begged to be spared, and they stopped. Gu then rode his bicycle to Nanxiang and reported to the Public Security Branch that he had been robbed in broad daylight, suffered injuries, and lost more than 180 yuan. Upon receiving the report, Officer Wu Zexing immediately dispatched armed police to take Gu by car to Lvyang Bridge and arrested Qian Wenbin, Qian Nairong, Qian Naizheng, Qian Minxing, the owner of the Sanxing Rice Shop, and Wu, a fellow worker in the Zhaochengji Noodle Shop, a total of five people, and together with Gu Guoxiang, escorted them to the county bureau. After Qian and others were arrested, the merchants and residents of Lvyang Bridge went on strike because they believed that Qian and others had been falsely accused of robbery. Chen Youmin, the director of the Public Security Bureau, personally went to Lvyang Bridge on the 18th to persuade the merchants and residents to resume business and to investigate the facts to determine how to handle the matter. Gu Guoxiang, according to the interrogation by Director Chen, lived on Hengfeng Road in Shanghai and opened the Rongxing Grocery Store. He came to Jiading to buy towels. When asked who had robbed him, Gu said that all five of them had laid hands on him, but he had not been robbed. Taicang.</p>

<p>Large Quantities of Silver Exported</p>
<h3 id="e104">Causing Concern in Shanghai Banking Circles <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Bei Songsun flew to Lushan the other day to discuss. According to the Central News Agency, since the United States nationalized silver, large quantities of silver have been exported from China, and the social finance will be greatly affected. The banking circles in Shanghai are very concerned about this and regard it as a worrisome matter. Therefore, they have repeatedly gathered to discuss rescue measures. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance is having financial experts study the measures. According to the banking circles in Shanghai, when the U.S. government raises the price of silver, silver from all regions will inevitably be exported. China will certainly not be able to avoid it. However, the large-scale export of silver will inevitably cause major unrest in a country's finances. Therefore, if measures are not taken to stop it, the impact will be immediately apparent. In Shanghai's financial circles, foreign merchants already hold great power. Therefore, stopping the export of silver requires foolproof measures. Most of the leaders of the Shanghai banking circles advocate that the Ministry of Finance levy an export tax on silver to stop it. The tax rate should be raised or lowered at any time so that silver exporters have no profit to be made, so that it can be stopped without being cut off. However, this method has not yet been decided. Whether it can be submitted to the government for implementation still needs to be considered. The Guowen News Agency reported that after the U.S. silver price increased, silver merchants in China who specialize in speculation and taking shortcuts are rushing to sell silver, in alarming numbers. The impact on China's market is very great. Therefore, the government and the banking circles are trying to remedy the situation. It is said that the government has invited Mr. Bei Songsun, the manager of the Bank of China, to fly to Lushan on the day before yesterday (Saturday). Mr. Chen of the Central Bank accompanied him. It is said that they will discuss the silver issue. As for the banking circles, they have not officially held a meeting. It is said that the banking circles have decided to suggest that the government increase the silver export tax or implement measures to stop the export of silver. However, according to news from the banking circles, this is not the case. However, the banking circles did have an informal meeting. Because Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jiying, etc. are in Moganshan, Zhang Gongquan has gone north, and Li Fuzun has gone abroad, no decision has been made. However, they plan to imitate the current system of controlling gold exports (according to the management of gold exports by the Central Bank), and also control silver exports. As for the government's opinion, it is necessary to wait for Mr. Bei Songsun to return to Shanghai, and the banking circles may discuss it again. The Nihon Mainichi Shimbun reporter interviewed Dr. Liu Dajun, an economic expert and director of the China Economic Statistics Research Institute, yesterday and asked for his opinion on how to remedy the silver outflow. He said that China's silver has long been in import surplus. Starting in 1932, it suddenly became an export surplus because the UK and Japan successively abandoned the gold standard and dumped foreign exchange. China's exports and intangible international income have all been sharply reduced, and we have had to use silver to obtain imported goods. This year, the U.S. government is more actively raising the price of silver. Speculators from various countries are rushing to buy silver, resulting in an export surplus of 30 million yuan in half a year. At the beginning of the month, the U.S. government announced the order to nationalize silver, which shows that the United States is determined to use silver as an inflationary currency. The price of silver will rise again, causing China's silver exports to reach more than 10 million yuan in the middle of last week. Because the U.S. government is cracking down on speculation, the silver is being shipped to London, Mumbai, and other places. Shanghai has a reserve of more than 500 million yuan. If only 40 million yuan is shipped out this year, it is only similar to the period during the European war, and there is no major harm. However, the future is long, and the price of silver will continue to rise, so the continuous outflow of silver will shake the financial system and lower prices, which will greatly affect China's economy. The relief method should be to reduce imports of goods and increase exports, and to restrict silver exports. Regarding the former, tariffs and foreign exchange dumping policies can be used. Regarding the latter, although silver exports can be prohibited, the method is too inactive. Once the ban is implemented, the domestic price of silver will be lower than the foreign price, and there will be a lot of smuggling. It is better for the government to control the import of silver, and it should not be shipped without government permission. In this way, smuggling is not necessary and does not need to make a profit, and speculative exports can be reduced. The need for speculation is different from the need for legitimate business. If there is no convenience for buying and selling, then the need will be reduced. If the market price of public bonds fluctuates too much, the exchange will stop trading, and the amount of the exchange will also be reduced. If there are too many silver exports and imports, the government should add control due to the currency standard. This is what should be done. From all sides.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Fluctuations in Rice and Grain Trade <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Fujian Rice Insufficient; Zhang Rice Doubtful</p>
<p>Silver and Money Businesses Continue to Purchase Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Widespread Panic; High Price of Rice in Jiangbei. Xinsheng News Agency reports that this year, due to the severe drought in various places, there is a shortage of rice and grain. Japanese merchants are taking the opportunity to transport Taiwanese rice to Shanghai under the guise of Zhang rice for dumping. Saigon rice is also gradually arriving in Shanghai. The reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency has learned the details, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e106">Japanese Rice Dumped in China <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Japanese merchants, seeing that China has been plagued by droughts and floods this year and is facing food shortages, are transporting large quantities of Taiwanese rice to China for dumping. To reduce costs, they first transport it to Xiamen and pretend it is Zhangzhou rice before transshipping it to Shanghai, hoping to avoid import taxes. However, after being detained by the customs, the rice merchants proved that it was indeed domestic rice, and it was released. However, according to the reporter's investigation, the rice is being handled by the Dou Street and Fengji Wharf rice shops in Nanshi. The first batch of 17,000 stones has already arrived in Shanghai, and the second batch of 10,000 stones is expected to arrive within a week. The total number of ordered transactions is more than 45,000 stones, and all will arrive in Shanghai at the beginning of next month. According to a clerk at Dacheng Rice Shop, the rice is the same as the one that was previously transported from Shanghai to Fujian, which proves that Fujian Province is short of rice, and it is undoubtedly Japanese goods disguised as domestic goods.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Fujian Province Can't Even Take Care of Itself <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>According to people in the rice industry, Fujian Province's annual rice production is not enough to supply itself, and the shortage is very large. Every year in the autumn, they come to Shanghai to purchase rice to supply the people's food for the second half of the year. Zhangzhou has never had japonica rice come to Shanghai, so the fact that Japanese rice is disguised as domestic rice this time proves that it is undeniable. However, general merchants only know how to seek profit and ignore the facts and deny Japanese rice, which is not worth the laughter of connoisseurs. In recent days, merchants from the three companies have been selling the rice in various districts. Transactions have already been made for more than 5,000 stones in the southern part of Shanghai, and none has been purchased in the northern part.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Tribute Rice Arrives in Shanghai in Batches <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>As for the speculative Saigon rice purchased by the rice industry and the silver and money industry, the total number is 450,000 stones, of which 300,000 stones are from the rice industry and 150,000 stones are from the silver and money industry. The two industries have continued to trade 100,000 stones with Saigon in the past three days. All of these 100,000 stones are open goods (meaning that they will be loaded starting from the beginning of the year and will arrive in Shanghai around January or February of next year), totaling 600,000 bags. The first batch of 100,000 bags has been arriving continuously. 200,000 bags are scheduled to be imported in September, and 200,000 bags are also scheduled to be imported in October. 100,000 bags will arrive in Shanghai at the end of January and the beginning of February. However, there are still continuous orders. The local sales in Shanghai are not strong.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Anhui and Hunan Restrict Exports <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu in Anhui Province is also a major rice-producing base. At the end of last month, the local authorities were panicked about preventing a rice shortage, so they issued an order prohibiting the export of old rice for two weeks. Although it has now been lifted, the export of new rice is still not allowed. Hunan is also a rice-producing area. The local government, in order to maintain the people's food supply, stipulates that each stone of rice will have an additional one yuan export tax to show its restriction. Therefore, rice and grain transported to Shanghai from the two places have disappeared. In addition, rice-carrying ships are being repaired in the summer, so only a dozen ships arrive every day. However, the people's food supply in Shanghai is not panicked because of the ban in the two provinces. Therefore, the price of rice still increased by 10 or 20 cents yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Zhejiang Handles 100,000 Bags of Shanghai Rice <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province has suffered a particularly severe drought this year, and water transportation has been completely cut off. Except for the stations along the railway, where transportation is still convenient, the rest rely on shoulder carrying and distribution. Therefore, the price of rice has soared. Rice merchants in various places in Zhejiang have successively purchased small bags of Hunan Wuhu Tongli Changshu Changzhou Wuxi Xian rice and japonica rice from rice merchants in Shanghai, totaling 100,000 bags, which have been transported in 20 batches. They are still in contact to continue purchasing. As for the harvests in Anhui, about 60% was harvested in June of this year, and about 70% in Hunan. All of them are being transported to Hubei, which is short of rice, for sale, so there is an order prohibiting exports.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Soaring Grain Prices in Jiangbei <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Shaobo, Tongzhou, Rugao, Yancheng, Huaian, and other places in Jiangbei, Jiangsu Province, had very rich autumn harvests this year. Because the initial price of new grain was only 3.6 yuan per dan (100 catties), rice merchants from Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places rushed to purchase it (by the way, two stones of rice equal one shi and one dou and five sheng). Therefore, the current price of grain has risen to 5.5 yuan, which is about 10.05 yuan per shi of Shanghai white rice. Generally, each rice plant in Jiangbei can produce more than 80 grains of rice, but this year it can produce more than 130 grains.</p>

<p>Consulting on Improving Silkworm Production, the New News Agency reports that Dr. Marie, a silk industry expert hired by the National Economic Council, has visited Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces since coming to China to investigate the status of silkworm production and mulberry cultivation. Having completed the investigation, she will draft plans for improving silkworm production as a reference for the Economic Council. It is understood that Dr. Marie came to Shanghai from Beijing specifically to discuss various silk industry improvements with Soong Tzu-wen, a standing committee member of the Economic Council, in recent days. It is also understood that the Silkworm Improvement Committee's plan for this year, in addition to purchasing 4,000 mu of land in Beijing and Hangzhou to improve mulberry cultivation and establish guidance centers for seed production, includes establishing a joint silk factory to improve reeling. Silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces interested in joining can do so, with the Improvement Committee responsible for guidance, to achieve unified improvement. The Jiangsu Province plans to issue public bonds.</p>

<p>Whether mortgaging or underwriting is undecided. Please ask the Central Government not to reduce the total amount. The New Voice News Agency reports that the Jiangsu Provincial Government plans to issue 30 million yuan in public bonds to develop water conservancy and reorganize new and old debts. It has specially sent the heads of the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments to Beijing to present the request to the Central Government not to reduce the amount, and to contact Shanghai banking circles. Details are as follows:</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government plans to issue 30 million yuan in public bonds to reorganize new and old debts, complete the project of diverting the Huai River into the sea, and open the Xin Canal, using Jiangsu's tax revenue as collateral. Detailed measures have already been drafted, with an annual interest rate of seven percent, and have been submitted to the Central Government for review. At the same time, contact is being made with Shanghai banking circles regarding (1) underwriting by banks for promotion and sales, and (2) mortgaging to banks for loans. Because the procedures are very complicated, preliminary contact is being made in advance. Formal negotiations and contracts will be signed after the Central Government approves the issuance. This is a preliminary contact, so specific measures have not yet been decided.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Request Not to Reduce <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Central Government intends to reduce the public bonds to 10 million yuan. Jiangsu Province has already prepared detailed budgets and plans for reorganizing new and old debts, completing the project of diverting the Huai River into the sea, and opening the Xin Canal. Reducing the amount will inevitably cause difficulties for the various planned projects. Therefore, Yu Jing-tang, the head of the Civil Affairs Department, and Zhao Di-hua, the head of the Finance Department, went to Beijing a few days ago to present the request to the Central Government not to reduce the amount. It is heard that it may be largely approved. The effect will be that the committee will allocate 105,000 yuan to reform the silk reeling machine.</p>

<p>Today is the ninth anniversary of the martyrdom of the late martyr Liao Zhongkai. The Municipal Party Headquarters has specially followed the regulations of the Central Government, published a notice to convene representatives from all sectors of the city, and held a memorial meeting in the auditorium of the headquarters. Committee member Xing Wan served as the chairman of the meeting. The Municipal Executive Committee also printed and distributed a letter to the public (text omitted). Central Committee member He Xiangning issued a "Message to Whampoa Students on the Anniversary of Mr. Liao": "It is the ninth anniversary of Mr. Liao's martyrdom. In these nine years, every time I think of this day, I cannot help but be heartbroken and weep. My sadness and tears may seem like a woman's sentiment, but in reality, the revolution is only cold ashes, and the fate of the nation is heading towards destruction. Those who know Mr. Liao, the revolutionary soldiers under his leadership, still have their blood up. Reflecting on the past and being heartbroken, it is not just me alone. For six years, in a situation where it was impossible to speak, this memorial day, which combines both public and private meanings, could only be observed with religious ceremonies in the newspaper. There was only pain in the heart and no words to express. Because people's hearts are dead and nothing can be done, writing every word and tear cannot awaken the numb hearts, only grief and indignation remain in my heart. Now, an unforgettable memory fills my mind and I cannot control myself. I must make a painful appeal to the Whampoa students who were once under Mr. Liao's leadership and shared the same hardships. Mr. Party Representative Liao's revolutionary efforts are recorded in history and known to all students, so I will not repeat them here. However, after the Sha Ji Massacre, he led the workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers in resisting British imperialism. The Canton-Hong Kong strike, one of the most glorious pages in revolutionary history, caused British imperialism to be disgraced and frightened. However, after Mr. Party Representative Liao died in a counter-revolutionary conspiracy, the revolutionary tide gradually declined and became calm due to the shattering of revolutionary psychology and changes in reality. After the September 18th Incident, the loss of the four northeastern provinces, the devastation of Shanghai, and the subjugation of North China, the officials did not defend the country and resist foreign aggression, but abandoned their armor and fled. They had no solutions and lost power and humiliated the country. In such a situation, if Mr. Party Representative Liao knew, he would certainly be angry and pained in the afterlife. If he were alive, he would surely lead the students and shed blood in the Black Water and White Mountains, not allowing the Japanese imperialists to take advantage of the cowardice and incompetence of those responsible for military and political affairs, and to advance inch by inch to this point of no return. However, Mr. Party Representative Liao's life was assassinated, and the responsibility of revolutionary leadership and national salvation was lost. The students who strived for the revolution and the nation, except for a few who shed blood on the outskirts of Shanghai in the battle against the Japanese imperialists, mostly devoted their brave and upright initial intentions to the civil war. The criticism of being cowardly in public battles and brave in private fights has fallen on the students. Even if the students can bear this, they have no way to face the dead, nor to face the future. Thinking of the revolutionary past, thinking of Mr. Party Representative Liao's spirit of sacrifice for the revolution, I wonder if the students."</p>

<p>From Daye and Singapore, a total of over fifty ships are loaded. Over ten Chinese ships should be rented. Japan has recently purchased large quantities of steel from various countries and is also focusing on non-ferrous metal ore. It is transported to Japan for steelmaking and used for manufacturing weapons. The iron ore from Daye Iron Mine in our country has been shipped to Japan as much as possible since the spring of this year. Originally, two ships were assigned to load it, but the number has been increased to seven. Now, a 7,000-ton giant ship is being rented from our country to join in the special loading of iron ore to Japan. Recently, Japan also purchased a large amount of iron ore, estimated at over one million tons, at Kaimana, near Singapore in the South Seas, and has dispatched a large number of ships to transport it to Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Leasing Ships from Our Country <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Currently, there are seven Japanese ships and one Chinese ship on the Daye route, specially transporting iron ore to Japan. At the Kaimana iron mine near Singapore, the Japanese side has dispatched over thirty ships of 5,000 tons or more, about 180,000 tons of Japanese ships, to transport this iron ore to Japan. Recently, in order to rush the transportation of this iron ore to Japan and rush the steelmaking, the existing Japanese ships are not enough to supply the loading. Therefore, over ten ships of 5,000 tons or more have been specially rented from our country's shipping industry. All of them have been sent to the South Seas to transport iron ore. The shortest rental period is half a year, and the longest is three years. The Chinese ships rented to transport iron ore for Japan have exceeded 100,000 tons in carrying capacity.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Transport to Yawata for Delivery <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Most of the Chinese ships rented by the Japanese are ships sailing in North China. Now, several more Chinese ships have come to Shanghai to continue renting. All of them are going to Singapore to load manganese ore and deliver it to the Yawata Steel Works in Japan. The rental price for each Chinese ship is approximately 10,000 yuan per month for a 7,000-ton ship. However, the crew members on the ship must be managed by the Japanese. During the rental period, no crew member is allowed to return to China without permission. The control is very strict. Currently, there are over forty ships, approximately 260,000 to 270,000 tons, dispatched by Japan to Singapore to transport ore. The Yawata Steel Works has 40,000 workers, making steel day and night.</p>
<h3 id="e120">A Group of Seamen Return Home <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Among the rented ships, one ship had over fifty seamen who could not return home due to the long rental period. Moreover, the daily necessities of the seamen traveling between the South Seas and Japan are much more expensive than in China, which is really inappropriate. This time, when the ship arrived in Nagasaki, Japan, all the seamen resigned and returned home. The shipowner has now recruited other seamen to go to Japan to replace them. However, after the issue of seamen leaving the ship, the Japanese side has returned this ship and is renting another ship in Shanghai to go to Japan to transport the steel. According to a certain seaman, the pier of the Kaimana mine can simultaneously dock seven ships. 7,000 tons of ore can be loaded in two days. The speed of transportation is really amazing. X X X X How can we explain ourselves and be understood by others? In the midst of unbearable retrospection and looking around, we commemorate Mr. Party Representative Liao. The students will certainly have generous and memorial words and articles. But rather than holding routine ceremonies, why not have a memorial of conscience? The students know that if the September 18th Incident had happened before 1925, Mr. Party Representative Liao would have led the students in a desperate battle against Japan, and would never have allowed the loss of power and humiliation of the country to increase day by day. However, the revolutionary past is over, and the fate of the country is on the path of destruction. The accusations of our compatriots and the ridicule of humanity should make the students responsible for the revolution, the nation, and the country feel awe. Although I am old and sick and living at sea, my thoughts for the revolution and the nation have never ceased. I am unable to fly high, and on this sad day, I cannot help but beat my chest and stamp my feet. The students have a mission on their shoulders. After commemorating your Party Representative Liao, how can you ensure that you are worthy of yourselves? Otherwise, although in reality you cannot exchange the students' military uniforms for women's clothes, in spirit you will be ridiculed for not having the spirit of a man. The depth of the national crisis cannot be expressed in words. The students who want to commemorate Mr. Liao should cherish themselves and cherish the nation. You must know that the day the nation is in danger is the day the soldiers shed blood. I think the students will be able to give me, the revolution, and the nation a satisfactory answer with facts. The students know that if you are not like this, you are not worthy to commemorate your Party Representative. Wang Chonghui</p>

<p>Judge Wang Chonghui of the International Court of Justice, who took leave to return from Europe, arrived in Hong Kong earlier this month on the same ship as Gu Weijun, the ambassador to France, and Hu Shize, the ambassador to Switzerland. After staying in Hong Kong for a short time, he went to Guangdong to visit Central Committee members such as Hu Hanmin. Having completed his business, he took the Dollar Steamship Company's President Grant north from Hong Kong to Shanghai to report to the Central Government. According to Dollar Steamship Company news, the ship is scheduled to arrive at the port around 5:00 pm today and dock at the Bailianjing Wharf in Pudong. Wang's relatives and friends in Shanghai have received telegrams in advance and are preparing to go to the dock to greet him. Wang is the chairman of the Shanghai Law and Politics College.

<h3 id="e123">Prohibition of Prize Savings <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Those already established should immediately stop accepting savings deposits and establish termination measures to be submitted for approval and implementation. The New Voice News Agency reports that after the Savings Bank Law was promulgated and implemented, the Ministry of Finance was ordered to implement it and copied the original text of the law, ordering all banks to comply with it. Regarding prize savings, it was decided to prohibit prize savings in accordance with Article 14 of the law. Prize savings that have already been established before the implementation of this law should immediately stop accepting savings deposits. Termination measures will be drafted by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. According to the provisions of Article 16, Paragraph 3, those who violate Article 14 will be sentenced to imprisonment for no more than three years for directors and supervisors, and those without directors and supervisors will be sentenced to their shareholders and fined between 1,000 and 5,000 yuan. Termination measures have been drafted. According to an investigation by a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, the existing banks that have established prize savings include (1) the Sino-French Savings Association, which was established in August 1918 with Sino-French joint venture and registered with the French Consulate and the Chinese government in Tianjin. In 1926, it was reorganized into a Chinese joint-stock company, and the French shares were completely recovered. It was approved and licensed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce of the Beijing government, and approved and licensed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry of the National Government in 1933. The total capital is 450,000 yuan. Since April 1934, it has applied to the Ministry of Finance to establish a general savings department. (2) The International Savings Society was founded in 1912 as a French commercial capital with a total amount of 2,797,202 yuan. The types of business are (1) prize savings, (2) real estate, and (3) mortgage loans.</p>

<p>The Second World War is about to break out, and the entire Soviet Union is stepping up war preparations. The Shenshi News Agency reports that Wei Daoming, the former Minister of Judicial Administration, traveled to Europe last year and has now returned to China and arrived in Shanghai. A reporter from the Shenshi News Agency specially drove to visit him and was informed that he had traveled to Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, and other countries for a period of ten months. He gave a very detailed account of the recent situation in various European countries and their relationship with the Far East. The following is a summary:</p>
<h3 id="e125">Economic Decline in European Countries <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wei first said that Europe is a place where he has traveled before, and its civilization and prosperity have long been praised by the world. However, the first deep impression he gained from this trip to Europe is that the economies of various countries are showing signs of decline, which is very different from the past. For example, beggars were rare in the cities of various countries in the past, but now there are unemployed people asking for help everywhere. Upon closer examination, it is all because production and consumption are not balanced, and many industrial and commercial enterprises are closed down, and the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. Secondly, in the cities of various countries, such as London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, and other world-famous places, there were originally no discounts or bargaining in the major stores, but what I saw this time was that not only could customers bargain at will, but the stores tried every means to attract and win the favor of customers, fearing that customers would leave. The prices of various goods and the rent of hotels and houses have all been reduced compared with the past. All of this is a sure sign of economic decline.</p>
<h3 id="e126">The Crisis of the War Is Imminent <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the so-called Second World War, Mr. Wei believes from what he saw on this trip to Europe that the European people were shocked by the First World War and are already disgusted with war. However, the authorities of various countries, in view of the tense situation between countries, are not willing to abandon their various military plans. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has forcibly occupied our four northeastern provinces, and international treaties regarded as sacred, such as the Nine-Power Treaty, have been torn up by violence. Therefore, the awareness that peace is not guaranteed is also engraved in the hearts of the world. In order to protect themselves and survive, they are sparing no effort to implement preparations for the Second World War. What I saw in Europe this time is that factories and schools have mostly carried out poison gas drills, and the cities of various countries are constantly improving their air defense facilities and are never slack. Even Switzerland, which is usually called a paradise, cannot be spared. This kind of atmosphere of defense and suspicion is becoming more and more intense due to the intensification of the aggressive behavior of a few ambitious countries, resulting in the recent failure of the disarmament conference. Even if the conference has resolutions, there is absolutely no guarantee that these common resolutions will have binding force. In addition, in order to consolidate their other positions, the great powers are implementing international means of vertical and horizontal diplomacy. If A and B do not form an alliance to control C, then E and F will reach an agreement to resist D. Recently, the European situation, which was once tense due to the Austrian incident, has temporarily eased with Germany's softening attitude. However, looking at the world situation today, the swords are drawn and the bows are bent. The Far East problem is especially full of problems. Speaking of this, I hope that the people of the country will be aware and prepare for it early. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3 id="e127">Soviet Russia's War Preparations in Three Aspects <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the artist Xu Beihong has already arrived in Shanghai. Mr. Xu traveled in Soviet Russia for more than ninety days, so he must be very familiar with the recent situation in Soviet Russia. A reporter from the Datong News Agency specially visited Mr. Xu at the Yipinxiang Hotel yesterday to discuss this issue and recorded his conversation as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Whole Country Is Stepping Up War Preparations <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Xu said first that the whole of Soviet Russia, from top to bottom, is aware of the fact that the disaster of war is imminent, and is currently doing its best to carry out the movement to defend the country. According to my observation, the war preparation work of these people can be divided into three points: (1) The Soviet Russian government is now intensifying the physical training of the people across the country. After the success of the Five-Year Plan, there are a great number of newly established large-scale sports fields. People across the country, regardless of gender, age, or size, must be forced to carry out various sports exercises so that every citizen is like copper tendons and iron bones. Last month (July 7), in order to intensify this work, the Soviet Russian government convened leaders from all over the country responsible for training the people's sports in Moscow to hold a grand parade. More than 110,000 people attended. At that time, I was also present to watch, and their spirit of tension and hard work was really amazing. (2) All adult citizens must receive military training, and even women cannot be exempted. Now, the training methods have been changed to use trade unions as the training unit, which is even more widespread than other conscription countries. In wartime, the whole country can immediately be soldiers. (3) The government often inspires the people's enthusiasm for war preparation in many ways. During the May 1st Labor Day this year, governments in various places convened local people to hold grand parades and demonstrations. At that time, I was in Moscow, and the people who participated in the parade totaled more than three million. Almost all of the residents of Moscow, men, women, old and young, participated. They gathered in the Red Square early in the morning to set off. Some people watched at 6 o'clock and did not finish watching until about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. There were also more than 500 fighter planes flying in the air, and the latest tanks and other new vehicles participated in the demonstration. All of these are only what I observed. In addition, there seem to be many war preparation works in Soviet Russia. Unfortunately, I am an artist, not a politician, so I did not investigate much.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The People of the Whole Country Intensify Production <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Soviet Russia is currently promoting the Second Five-Year Plan. People across the country, regardless of gender, must engage in production work. Especially recently, with the clouds of war looming and the environment deteriorating, the people are working harder and with more enthusiasm, and are not allowed to have any lazy or easy-going behavior.

<p>Japan uses it to encourage the people, but the people of our country use it to broadcast vulgar songs. The New News Agency reports that recently, someone who has just returned to Shanghai from Japan said that the Japanese government, in view of the crisis in 1936, is about to arrive, so it is racking its brains to study countermeasures and is also encouraging the people to be vigilant. It is learning from the old wisdom of the King of Wu and broadcasting warning sentences on the radio, such as (The crisis of 1936 is coming), (Prepare for the Second World War quickly), (All countries hate Japan, we should strive for strength), (Imperial people should sacrifice for the Empire), etc., so that the people who hear it can be aroused patriotic enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The clothing is marked with the letters PAA. The company has sent personnel to identify it. The Shenshi News Agency reports that since the China National Aviation Corporation's Sikorsky S-16 aircraft crashed in the waters off Zhenhai this spring, cushions, mail, and the body of radio operator Carlson have been salvaged one after another. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, a reporter from the Shenshi News Agency learned from the company that a telegram report was received from the Dinghai authorities stating that fishermen in Dinghai found a corpse in the waters of Hangzhou Bay. It had already rotted, but the clothing on it was marked with the letters PAA. The three letters are the constitution of the Pan American Pacific Airways, and Gas Tor's name is also engraved on it. It can be determined that it is undoubtedly the body of the pilot Gas Tor of the crashed aircraft. According to reports, Mr. Gas came to China last year to serve as a pilot and was quite conscientious. After the accident, his wife had returned to her hometown of Chicago. Now that Mr. Gas's body has been found, the company has decided to send personnel to Dinghai today to investigate. After confirmation, the Pan American Pacific Airways and his wife will be notified by telegram, and at the same time, arrangements will be made to transport the body to Shanghai for shipment to the United States. Compared with what is broadcast on the radio, most of it is decadent and uninspired vulgar songs, which cannot help but be filled with emotion.</p>

<p>Yang Jie, the president of the Central Army University, and his party, who were ordered to go to Europe and the United States to investigate military affairs, have traveled to various countries and have been warmly welcomed. Because Mr. Yang needs to rush back to participate in the opening ceremony of the third phase of the Lushan Officer Corps on September 11, he telegraphed friends in Shanghai yesterday, saying that he had set off to return home and would arrive in Shanghai in early September, and then go to Nanjing to report and then go to Jiangxi.</p>

<p>Cargo transportation has sharply decreased, and austerity is implemented. The World News Agency reports that according to news from Nisshin Kisen Kaisha yesterday, from January to June of this year, the net profit of Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's business in the Yangtze River area of our country was only 150,000 yuan, a decrease of more than 200,000 yuan compared to the net profit of 380,000 yuan in the first half of the year. The situation of its cargo transportation decline is rare in the past years. The reasons are nothing more than the increase in our country's import tariff rates, and it is not without difficulty for Japanese goods to be imported and dumped in the interior. In addition, due to natural and man-made disasters in our country, the rural economy has gone bankrupt, and the purchasing power of the people is also far less than before, so the consumption quantity has been sharply reduced. The Nisshin Kisen Kaisha has a total of 21 merchant ships sailing in the Yangtze River area of our country. Usually, all of them are opened and sailed during the peak cargo transportation period. However, in recent months, the trade situation in various ports along the Yangtze River has been abnormally depressed, and the transportation industry has gradually shown signs of panic. In order to reduce expenses and implement austerity, the company has decided to suspend nine of the 21 postal ships. If cargo transportation recovers, it can be restored at any time. If the goods are still sluggish, it may continue to suspend navigation in order to save the situation.</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Held a Banquet to Bid Farewell. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has specially established a factory inspection section. After the implementation of factory inspection, the initial stage has been completed. Now, in view of the danger of factory boilers, factory inspector Lu Jicang has been specially sent to the Babcock &amp; Wilcox boiler factory in the UK for practical training. The introducers are the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Purchasing Committee and the National Government Construction Committee. It has been approved by the municipal government, and overseas passports have also been processed. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai for overseas at the end of this month. It is planned to train in the factory for two years and six months. At the same time, he will investigate foreign factories to serve as a reference for factory inspection in our country. All the factory inspectors of the bureau held a farewell banquet at the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge the night before. The director of the section, Tian Heqing, gave a speech, hoping that Lu Jun would contribute the foreign boiler equipment he has learned from his internship to our country as a reference for improving boiler equipment. It was not until late at night that everyone dispersed happily.</p>

Those who went to the North Station to welcome him included Zhao Yan, the former chairman of Hunan, and Tang Zhuxin, Buddhist layman Qu Wenliu, etc. Because the scriptures recited by the Panchen Lama at the Vajra Dharma Assembly in Hangzhou earlier were all in Tibetan, and Rongzeng is proficient in Chinese, he was invited to Shanghai to translate the scriptures. The office is located at No. 11 Yareli, Yare Road, in the French Concession.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer in Hubei Province, rainfall has been scarce, leading to a hopeless autumn harvest. More than twenty counties, including Huanggang, are experiencing disaster, with famine arriving in succession. Furthermore, more than ten counties, including Xiangyin, have suffered from upstream mountain torrents, causing river embankments to collapse and destroying homes and crops. The Hubei Provincial Association in Shanghai, noting the consecutive natural disasters of flood and drought, which are even more severe than the disasters of the Xinwei year [1931], convened a meeting to discuss relief measures. Yesterday, they received an urgent telegram from the Hubei Provincial Disaster Relief Committee. Consequently, they convened an emergency meeting the day before yesterday at the association's office at No. 29 Edward Road [today's Yan'an East Road], attended by Messrs. Guan Jiongzhi, Wang Shaocheng, Liu Wanqing, Zhu Dehe, Zhou Zun, Yu Yanqing, Peng Yuncen, Mei Huanhou, Qiu Zipei, Yao Jiapeng, Gui Xiangqing, Yi Nanzhen, Gao Jianqing, Lu Xingjie, Liu Diechen, Qin Runsheng, Xiong Jiu, Zhang Weimin, Xu Huisan, Ding Yutian, Wei Futang, Zhang Shutang, Chang Caichen, Wang Shutang, Cao Dongchuan, Wang Quanwang, Zhang Zixia, Zhang Shaoping, Pan Haishan, Gan Lei, Sun Mingjiang, Hong Shiwei, and others. It was resolved that Messrs. Wang Shaocheng and Peng Yuncen be publicly recommended to travel to Beijing by overnight train that very evening to join forces with the Beijing Hubei Provincial Association and request the government and the Relief Affairs Committee to quickly allocate large sums of money for relief. At the same time, a fundraising committee for Hubei flood and drought disasters was organized to solicit donations from various industries, guilds, sectors, and charitable organizations in Shanghai, to be remitted to Hubei for distribution to aid the disaster-stricken people.</p>
<p>The Anhui Jixi County Drought Relief Committee telegraphed, requesting help from fellow countrymen abroad to relieve the suffering of the disaster victims. Addressed to the Shanghai Jixi Fellow-Countrymen Association: "Natural disasters are rampant, affecting almost the entire country. Our county is suffering from a severe drought, unprecedented in nearly a century. The severity of the disaster is beyond description. Moreover, the people have little savings, and can only sit and wait for death. Although the county government has sent an official report via telegram, official procedures are slow and time is of the essence. Drought relief is like fighting fire; delay is unacceptable. As our county's expatriate organization, you feel our pain and share our concerns. We implore you to convene an emergency meeting, allocate a substantial sum, and send personnel to distribute aid to alleviate the famine, so that our county's people can avoid becoming starving ghosts. We make this urgent plea, hoping for your understanding." Respectfully, Cheng Jiesheng, Cao Meidong, Chen Tao'an, Hu JieFu, Zhang Shouqing, and other standing members of the Jixi County Drought Relief Committee, along with all public groups and gentry in the county, respectfully kowtow, bearing their official seal, Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Jin Xi Secretly Escorted to Korea <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to Five Years Imprisonment in Gwangju New Life Agency, it is Said. Jin Xi, a Korean youth who had already become a Chinese citizen, was arrested last year by plainclothes police from the Japanese consulate. Various legal organizations in this city, on the grounds that Jin had already become a Chinese citizen, joined with Jin's family to actively rescue him. They also requested the municipal government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge serious representations based on reason, but to no avail. Almost a year has quickly passed, and the people of the country have gradually forgotten about it. Now, Mr. Zheng, a committee member of an important commercial organization in this city, told a reporter from the New Life Agency that, according to reliable information, Jin Xi was secretly escorted to Gwangju, Korea by the Japanese consulate several months after his arrest. He has now been sentenced to five years imprisonment in Gwangju Prison. This is a heavier sentence than those of An Chang-ho, who was arrested after the January 28th Incident [the Shanghai Incident of 1932], and Li Chunshan, who was kidnapped in the Chinese-controlled Nanshi district last year. Mr. Zheng continued, saying that Jin Xi had already become a Chinese citizen and possessed a certificate of nationality of the Republic of China. He was also a member of the Chinese Nationalist Party. There is absolutely no doubt that he is a citizen of the Republic of China. Yet now, within Chinese territory, he is subjected to the tyranny of a powerful force without the protection of the Chinese government. The words of Jin's mother, Cui Huisheng, that they are doubly slaves of a fallen nation, fill people with deep sorrow and indignation.</p>

<p>Tragic Cylinder Explosion at Taiyi Malt Essence Powder Factory</p>
<p>More than Thirty Casualties</p>
<h3 id="e143">Factory Owner Zhang Jingchu Also Among the Victims <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The sound of the cylinder was different from usual yesterday morning. Just as they were about to inspect it, the cylinder suddenly exploded. The Taiyi Malt Essence Powder Factory No. 2 and wholesale shop at No. 33-34, Lane 3, Hengqing Lane, along the road at the end of Rue Bayle (near Rue Zikawei) in the French Concession, experienced a sudden cylinder explosion at 7:15 yesterday morning. Fire broke out immediately, walls collapsed, and bricks and stones flew everywhere, resulting in the immediate crushing and burning of employees and passersby, totaling more than thirty people as continuously discovered. Factory owner Zhang Jingchu was also among the victims. The fire brigade is still continuing to dig, and the number may not be limited to this. In total, there are seven dead and twenty-eight injured, truly a rare tragedy in recent times. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Expansion of Factory No. 2 <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Jingchu, a native of Zhoushan, Zhejiang, founded the Taiyi Malt Essence Powder Factory at the end of Haichang Branch Road in Zhabei five years ago, specializing in the manufacture of flavored essence powder and distributing it to various places. The business was quite extensive. At that time, the Zhang family lived at No. 1, Samsung Lane, Rue Bayle. Seeing the business develop and the demand for goods exceeding supply, Zhang rented a two-story, three-section Shikumen [stone gate] house at No. 33-34, Hengqing Lane, opposite the street, to expand Factory No. 2, and to serve as a distribution office and packaging workshop. There were about forty to fifty workers (men and women) inside and staff members in total. Zhang served as the factory director himself, and hired Wang Zhengyu as the manager.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Situation Inside the Factory <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The entire layout of the house was as follows: the front building on the second floor was used to store malt powder raw materials, the front building on the third floor was used for female workers to bottle and package, the back building was occupied by the wife of factory owner Zhang Jingchu (née Huang), and the ground floor was opened as a distribution office. The main part, the steam boiler, was installed in the kitchen, and the second-floor pavilion room was where the steam pipe were located. The person in charge of managing the steam boiler and steam pipes was an old man in his fifties known as Old Man Bai. The working hours of the factory were from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. When work was urgent, they would often open a night shift.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Collapse of the Sky, Earthquake <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>At about 7 o'clock yesterday morning, as the workers were working, they suddenly heard the sound of the steam pipe was different from usual. Upon closer inspection, it sounded as if part of the air was leaking. Just as everyone was in doubt, hot air suddenly rose from the malt powder raw material room on the second floor. The female workers on the third floor knew that something was wrong, but before they could go downstairs to ask, there was a loud bang, a sound like the sky collapsing and the earth splitting. Unfortunately, all the people in the factory and pedestrians and vendors on the side of the road were completely crushed under the collapsed walls, rubble, broken beams and pillars of the house. In an instant, smoke rose and flames erupted. The tragic scene unfolded: in addition to the entire factory being destroyed, many of the neighboring houses on three sides were also shaken and collapsed, and the fire spread to the Zhao family on the right.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Tragic Situation Unveiled <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>After the tragedy occurred, the police station in charge of Lukiawan heard the news and immediately sent a large number of detectives to maintain order. At the same time, the fire brigade was notified to dispatch all its members. The firefighters rushed to the scene, first trying their best to put out the fire and then trying to rescue people. More than twenty people were immediately pulled out, presenting a scene of severed heads and broken feet, charred heads and broken faces, which was unbearable to look at. At that time, traffic was completely cut off from Malan Road in the east to Shihui Port in the west, and all vehicles had to take a detour.</p>
<h3 id="e148">List of the Injured <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The injured who were pulled out included Zhang Huang (age 44, from Suzhou), the factory owner's wife; Zhang Yixing (age 36, local, a vendor on the roadside outside the factory); Hu Laowu (age 34, from Jiangbei, residing at the Sihai Tea House, Daxing Street, Huajie); Wang Chengmei, a ten-year-old child residing at No. 64, Hengqing Lane; Cao Ziying, a seven-year-old child residing at No. 34, the same lane; Zhang Cao (age 26, from Tongzhou), a worker at the factory; Cao Song (age 48, local); Ji Jinmao (age 52, from Zhenze, residing at No. 1, the same lane); Li Zhu (age 26, from Tongzhou, residing at No. 144, Anna King Road); Li Zhang (age 52, residing at No. 39, the same lane, a wet nurse who happened to be playing on the roadside outside the factory); Xu Shen (age 48, from Zhenjiang, residing at No. 9, the same lane); Xu Huizhen, a young girl (age 18, from Suzhou); Chen Aniu (age 30, a carpenter in the same lane); Cao Meng (age 16, a female worker); Shao Xintai (age 17, a worker from Ningbo); Liu Qingyuan (age 16, a passerby residing at No. 177, Route des Pères); Zhang Qingchu (age 16, a worker); Jiang Qingyu (age 46, a worker from Ningbo); Xu Lisheng (age 30, a worker); Wang Yigao (age 24, from Yancheng, a rickshaw puller residing at No. 869, Rue Bayle); Jing Yilin (age 43, from Nanjing, working at the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau); Ge Renhe (age 36, from Tongzhou, a rickshaw puller); Fan Laosan (age 38, a rickshaw puller); Hao Chuanzhang (age 31, a worker from Anhui); Chuan Bingsheng (age 33, residing at No. 1, Hengqing Lane); Zhao Jiaqiao, a carpenter (age 33, female); and two boys, one about seven or eight years old and one about twelve years old, whose names are unknown.

<h3 id="e149">Seven Dead <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Four bodies were immediately pulled out: one about fifty years old, presumably the old man Bai who managed the steam boiler; one whose whole body was burned to a crisp, proven to be the factory owner Zhang Jingchu; one was apprentice Zhang Jiangyao, and one was apprentice Guangyao. By 1 p.m., Jing Yilin, who was seriously injured, and the servant Ji Jinmao, had both died in the hospital due to their injuries. The above six bodies were sent to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for examination, awaiting the Second Special District Court to conduct an autopsy this morning. Finally, at about 6 p.m., another charred and unrecognizable body was pulled out and sent to the same place for examination. In total, 28 people were sent to the hospital for treatment, of whom 12 were slightly injured and discharged after bandaging, and 16 seriously injured were hospitalized, of whom three were in critical condition.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Cause of the Disaster <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>After the incident, the police speculated that the cause of the disaster was either the steam boiler was too hot, or that the old man Bai who managed the work lacked experience. In addition, most of the raw materials were configured using strong acid, and a large amount of gasoline was piled next to the steam boiler, so once the steam pipe leaked and sprayed water into the malt material room, hot air rose. After the steam boiler exploded, the strong acid fuel ignited together, resulting in a catastrophic situation. The deceased factory owner Zhang Jingchu had five children, who lived together in No. 1, Samsung Lane, opposite the street. The eldest son works in a foreign firm, and the rest are young and still studying.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Continued Trial Record of Wang Zhaocheng, Involved in the Liu Chongwu Case <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zhentao, manager of the Maotai Western Goods Store at No. 310, Xinzha Road, and Wang Yirong, partner of the Yuheng Western Goods Store at No. 339, Hankou Road, were found to be profiting by selling inferior goods. From November 18th to 24th of the previous year [1933], the Iron Blood Assassination Squad learned about this and sent warning letters that were ignored, so they used guns, fatally wounding them. Subsequently, Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songsou, and Tian Shuiyang were arrested by the police. As a result, the First Special Court found them guilty and sentenced them to imprisonment. However, the guns and bombs in this case were supplied by a man named Wang Zhaocheng. On June 15th of this year, Wang was arrested by Chinese detectives Ma Bingzhang and Wang Guangtian from the Jiaxing Road police station at No. 75, North Jiangxi Road. Wang is from Haining, age 42. Since the January 28th Incident [the Shanghai Incident of 1932], he has been a member and deputy officer of the Shanghai Citizens' Righteous Army, which departed to the Northeast Engineering Team. He was sent to the court, and repeatedly denied the charges during the interrogation. An order was issued to present counter-evidence to verify the facts, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the trial judge Liu Yugui continued the trial in the third criminal court. The defendant's lawyers Jiang Yiping, Jiang Chiping, and Sun Biwu were present on time. Lawyer Jiang presented the letter of inquiry to the court, and Wang Zhaocheng firmly claimed that it was irrelevant to this case, saying that his patriotic actions were different from those of Liu Chongwu and others, and asked for clarification. After the lawyer of the Public Works Department, Ru Baoyi, and the defendant's lawyers earnestly argued, the court ordered him to be returned to custody and set a date for the verdict.</p>
<p>Rampant Child Trafficking in This City</p>
<h3 id="e152">Children Are Being Abducted in Increasing Numbers <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Taking Advantage of Cooling Off Outdoors</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Orders Citizens to Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Datong News Agency reports that, due to the unusually hot weather this year, residents of this city are taking their daughters and sons outside to cool off in the evenings. Parents are sometimes careless, and children are taken advantage of by abductors, who entice them to be sold to other places. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has received repeated reports from citizens about such incidents. In order to lock the stable door after the horse is stolen, the bureau issued public notice No. 6716 yesterday, ordering citizens to pay attention, stating, "In recent months, this bureau has repeatedly received reports from citizens that children have been abducted and requesting that the authorities be ordered to investigate, etc. After investigation, this city is a place where people from all walks of life gather, good and bad are mixed, and it is easy for criminals to hide. Every summer and autumn, the weather is hot, and citizens' children are often outside to cool off, so criminals take the opportunity to abduct and sell them to other places, harming people, which is extremely hateful. This bureau has previously issued a notice urging citizens to pay attention to prevention, and has separately sent letters to the authorities to investigate and handle the cases. Based on the previous situation, the previous order should be reiterated. In addition to sending separate letters, this notice is reissued to all residents of this city to be aware, pay close attention to prevention, strictly prohibit children from going out alone, and not accept food given by others or talk to strangers to avoid being abducted. Be sure to pay attention to this!"</p>
<h3 id="e153">Witness in the Longhua Temple Lawsuit Requests <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Investigate the Abbot Xingkong Thoroughly</p>
<p>Allowing Corrupt Monks to Extort and Collect Money</p>
<p>A Pure Buddhist Land is Filled with Black Smoke and Foul Air</p>
<p>The abbot monk Xingkong of Longhua Temple sued the former abbot monk Yuanzhao in the local court for privately entering into an agreement with Hu Suji, infringing on temple property, and requesting a judgment confirming that the mortgage management rent collection contract entered into by Yuanzhao et al. was invalid. Judge Wang Run has repeatedly opened court hearings to investigate the case, but no conclusion has been reached. For the sake of caution, the judge has notified the lawyers of both parties, Pan Zhensheng, Yuan Xilian, Sha Xunyi, and Chen Wenzhao, to personally visit Longhua Temple for on-site investigation. The day before yesterday was the date for the continued trial, and witnesses were summoned to court, such as the temple monk Fangcheng, etc. Because they did not appear in court, it was ordered to summon them again. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the witness Fangcheng submitted a statement to the Shanghai Buddhist Association and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the abbot is mediocre and the temple affairs are neglected, and requesting that you supervise the investigation and quickly send personnel to investigate and remove him from office. "The Longhua Temple in this city has been under the abbot monk Xingkong since last winter. This happened to coincide with the prosperous incense season this spring, and it was also the time when the troops withdrew. Everyone said that this was a good opportunity to restore the ancient temple. However, since taking over, the abbot has taken wrong measures, neglected temple affairs, and introduced ordinary corrupt monks to collude with each other, resulting in hundreds of malpractices in the temple and corruption reaching its extreme. For example, during the incense season this spring, ordinary corrupt monks were used to collect donations in the name of alms, but in reality, they extorted money, causing complaints from the pilgrims. Moreover, each corrupt monk, after being well-fed and warmly clothed, thought of lewdness. Among them, as many as seven or eight people suffered from venereal diseases, and only Xu Jingbo's clinic in this area treated them. There are also quite a few people who arbitrarily smoke morphine and red pills in the temple. Two people have been discovered and detained, and the Health Bureau's drug rehabilitation center has ordered them to quit drugs, but they have not yet been released. Other things, such as smoking, drinking, gambling, and illegal fighting, are handled by the No. 3 police station of the 6th district stationed in the temple almost every day. All of these things are true facts and can be verified. All of this is the actual situation that the abbot took wrong measures and colluded with the monks, resulting in the neglect of temple affairs. What's more, the income from the incense season in the temple this spring was the highest in history, no less than tens of thousands of yuan. Now, a grand Buddhist ceremony is being held, and the income has reached more than 3,000 yuan. However, the abbot only painted the abbot's hall and the main hall once, and slightly repaired the doors and windows, etc. Although the troops have withdrawn from the other halls, no repairs have been made. It is now heard that the money from the previous income has long been spent, and it is claimed that the debt is as high as five or six thousand yuan. In such a situation, the secrets behind it can be imagined. In order to preserve the ancient temple, I cannot remain silent. Therefore, I venture to submit this report to your association and bureau, requesting that you supervise the investigation, quickly send personnel to investigate and remove him from office, and I will be deeply grateful."</p>

<p>Crashed into a Wall at the Intersection of Defeng Road</p>
<p>Zhang Dexing, a native of Ningbo, age 35, runs the Liji Electric Material Store on Sichuan Road. He has a surplus of income and is financially well-off. Recently, due to the hot weather, he opened a room at the Central Hotel, Room 501, and invited friends to take refuge from the heat. Yesterday, he purchased a new car, registered as No. 5774. At about 0:30 this morning, Zhang was in high spirits and drove with his friend Ma Guisheng, age 42, a lawyer (residing at No. 49, Lane 548, Dongyouheng Road), and two prostitutes to Huxi to take a drive and test the quality of the car. However, Zhang was not good at driving. When he drove to the intersection of Daxilu and Defeng Road, the car slammed into the wall on the side of the road. With a loud crash, a major disaster occurred. The front of the car was badly damaged. Zhang's mouth was cut by the glass in the car, and his head was seriously injured. Ma Guisheng's head was also seriously injured. However, the two women were sitting in the back and were fortunately not affected. After the accident, Chinese police officers 3345 used an ambulance to rush them to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, Zhang died of his injuries at 1:15.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Alarming Increase in Imports <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>This year's six-month import total: Over 880,000 yuan.  Orange soda is also a popular item for cooling off in the summer. Besides manufacturing in local factories, large quantities are imported every summer. Since fresh orange juice became popular, the use of oranges has expanded, and their sales have almost rivaled those of watermelons.  Shanghai, in particular, is a place where a large amount of fresh orange juice is consumed.  The recent import values ​​of these two commodities are noteworthy.  A reporter from the New News Agency learned from the International Trade Bureau that orange imports in June this year reached over 87,900 yuan, and soda imports reached over 24,000 yuan.  The total import value of oranges in the first six months of this year was over 800,000 yuan, which is a considerable figure. Soda was worth over 72,000 yuan, with June accounting for almost one-third.  The total for both items was 880,000 yuan, a rather alarming figure.  The work of injecting cholera vaccines is being carried out very vigorously, and the number of injections is several times higher than in previous years. This year, from May 15th to the end of May, a total of 42,775 men and 21,504 women were injected, totaling 64,279 people. In June, a total of 79,340 men and 29,513 women were injected, totaling 108,853 people. Within two months, a total of 173,132 people were injected. Although July has not yet been finalized, the Nanshi Health Office has already reported to the bureau that 91,647 men and 57,681 women were injected, totaling 149,328 people. Combining the previous figures, the total is 322,460 people. Adding the number of injections from other health offices, the total is likely to be no less than 400,000 people. The construction of new-style wards at the Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital, originally a renovation of the Zhabei Public Hospital, was considered too simple and not suitable. The Health Bureau, aware of this, decided to add nine new-style wards in the open space in front of the hospital so that all kinds of dangerous infectious diseases could be housed in dedicated rooms. The first phase of the plan is to build three wards, which are currently under construction and are expected to be completed by mid-November, at an estimated cost of over 25,000 yuan. These wards are all built according to the latest style of infectious disease wards. After completion, 75 beds can be added, and various infectious diseases can be isolated separately to avoid danger. The bureau holds a routine Chinese medicine registration examination every year. This year's registration examination will be held from August 6th to 15th. Oral examinations will be held at the Hu Nan District Health Office starting from August 6th, written examinations will be held at the Aiqun Girls' School starting from August 15th, and clinical experiments will be held at the Guangyi Chinese Medicine Hospital starting from August 13th and ending on the 15th. All examination matters will be the responsibility of the Chinese Medicine Examination Committee. This year, the number of Chinese medicine practitioners registering is quite enthusiastic, totaling 721 people. Rickshaw Guild</p>

It is reported that gentry from all walks of life in Yangzhou, having learned that the Zhenjiang National Products Exhibition organized by the association is about to close, sent representatives to Shanghai on the 18th to request the association to lead the manufacturers participating in the Zhenjiang exhibition to cross the river and continue to hold the national exhibition in Yangzhou, so as to give the local people an opportunity to recognize national products and promote the circulation of national products in the interior. After learning of the situation, the association, feeling that the enthusiasm of all circles in Yangzhou was commendable, immediately telegraphed its temporary office in Zhenjiang to convene a meeting of representatives of manufacturers participating in the Zhenjiang exhibition to make a public decision.

<h3 id="e161">Great Achievement in the National Gypsum Industry <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Gypsum is an important material for industrial and chemical uses, and the difference between its imports and exports is vital to the national economy. As a reporter concerned about natural science and especially focusing on mining and production, I visited Mr. Zhu Xuexu, assistant manager of the China Gypsum Company, to investigate the company's business situation and the prospects of China's gypsum industry. Mr. Zhu received me and briefly stated that urban civilization, industrial development, and the improvement and propagation of farmland, the acquisition of porcelain models, artistic images, medicines, and dyes all require gypsum as an essential element. Unfortunately, Chinese people have not paid attention to this, resulting in the supply of gypsum raw materials used by various construction factories, cement factories, porcelain companies, chemists, agronomists, and other fields relying mostly on imported products. The colleagues of our company were alarmed by this and established the China Gypsum Company in Shanghai last year to sell gypsum produced from a mine in Shanxizhen, in order to recover some of the profit rights. From the beginning of operations, we were enthusiastically adopted by various parties. Now, the quantity is increasing daily, and the supply cannot meet the demand. Therefore, our company cannot but strive to expand its business scope. In addition to selling gypsum produced from various mines, we have recently acquired the mining rights for a rich gypsum deposit in Henan Province, which is actively underway, serving as the unshakeable foundation of our company for a century. It can meet the inexhaustible needs of the Chinese people. Our company now plans to open a factory to manufacture gypsum powder for use as raw materials for major factories across the country. At the same time, we will prepare fertilizer to prevent foreign goods from being dumped on the market, avoiding the exploitation of farmers. We also plan to manufacture unusually strong and white gypsum boards to meet the needs of the latest types of buildings. Moreover, the quality of all goods is pure and excellent, and the price is cheaper than imported goods. We are currently raising large sums of money to increase capital and advance together with entrepreneurs in the country. After listening to Mr. Zhu's words, I felt deeply comforted. This is truly a pragmatic and realistic endeavor to recover profit rights and improve people's livelihoods. I then took my leave, as Mr. Zhu was busy with his work.</p>

<p>Mr. Lu Rongguang, Chief Accountant of the Ministry of Communications, has spared no effort in reforming the accounting system of various affiliated institutions since taking office. For example, the recent revision of the telecommunications accounting system has thoroughly reformed the malpractices of telecommunications accounting in the past and demonstrated his determination. In April this year, due to a lack of qualified accounting personnel, he specifically requested the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to submit a request to the Examination Yuan to hold a temporary examination for accounting personnel of the affiliated institutions of the Ministry of Communications, enrolling 51 people in the advanced and general groups, who were assigned to affiliated institutions in Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin, Wuhan, and other places for internships to prepare for the implementation of the new accounting system. Now that the internship of these personnel has expired, Mr. Lu recently took the time to visit Shanghai for inspection. Over the past few days, he has met with the intern personnel of the advanced and general groups and inquired in detail about the accounting situation of various affiliated institutions, and provided many instructions. He has been extremely busy. It is reported that he has now completed his work and will return to Beijing tonight.</p>

<p>A tobacco and lottery shop at No. 28 Avenue Road was suddenly attacked by three bandits at around 8:40 pm last night. Only one bandit had a handgun. When they entered the shop, they pretended to be customers.

The shop owner and others were unable to resist, and approximately 60 yuan in cash and silver dollars stored inside was looted. They fled out the door. Afterwards, the shop owner reported the incident to the police station in charge and requested an investigation.</p>

<p>Because they disrupt tranquility, a warning to remove them. According to yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Japanese Daily, several radio shops on Zha Pu Road and Wusong Road installed loudspeakers in front of their stores for the current Japanese Koshien high school baseball tournament, so that the general public could listen to the live broadcast. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Municipal Council police, feeling that the crowds of Japanese listeners gathering on the streets were obstructing traffic and causing danger, and that the loudspeakers were being turned on early in the morning, causing a disturbance to nearby residents, issued a warning to each radio shop on the afternoon of the 18th and ordered the removal of the loudspeakers, causing each shop to suffer considerable losses.</p>

<p>The Fifth Branch of the Second Special District City Federation petitioned the municipal government to ban it immediately. The Fifth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens Federation petitioned the municipal government yesterday to ban public toilets in the Tang Jia Wan vegetable market. (Omitted above) According to a joint letter from the stores on Zhao Zhou Road and Lan Wei Ai Road in Tang Jia Wan: Xieli Xiang, Fumaocheng Wine Shop, Yuyuan Changhao, Huaxing Mat Shop, Wang Jinji, Yuquan Yong, Yitai Meat Shop, Yuquanlou, and other stores, after the Tang Jia Wan vegetable market was rebuilt, a public toilet was built in the center of the market. The construction is appropriately located along Lan Wei Ai Road, which is next to Zhaojulu. The construction of a public toilet should be located in a quiet and remote area inside the vegetable market. The existing public toilet is located in a prosperous commercial area both in front and behind it. The businesses are all opened in that area, and the impact of the public toilet has led to poor business, and few people are willing to patronize them. The toilet is the main source of disease-carrying flies. In the summer heat, focusing on sanitation is extremely important. The stench from the public toilet is so strong that it can cause people to cover their noses. The market has now been rebuilt, and there are many shops, and we are eagerly seeking the prosperity of the Chinese commercial area. How can we make it thrive? But to have a public toilet that everyone covers their noses in front of the shops, how can we talk about revitalizing the market? For the sake of business and public health, the undersigned must jointly request the association to forward the request to the municipal government, ordering the health bureau to quickly ban it and focus on sanitation. This is for the public benefit, etc. According to this, President Chiang Kai-shek issued the New Life Movement, which emphasizes hygiene as the most important thing. Having the public toilet in a prosperous commercial area violates the principles of the New Life Movement. Not only does it hinder hygiene, but it also affects appearances. According to the letter, the reason is that the situation is presented to you for your inspection and approval to order the health bureau to immediately ban it in order to emphasize sanitation and be for the public convenience.</p>

<h3 id="e169">The Yarn Tape Industry is Declining <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Lu Xingzhuang, chairman of the guild, seeks ways to save the industry. A reporter from the Industry News visited Mr. Lu Xingzhuang, chairman of the Yarn Tape Industry Association, yesterday, and he gave a detailed account of the industry's situation, which is recorded as follows: According to Mr. Lu, the history of yarn tape in China began in the eighth year of the Republic of China when the Student Federation first created it. It has been in business for fifteen years, and its business has spread throughout the country. The most prosperous period was in the eighteenth and nineteenth years of the Republic of China, when there were as many as forty factories, and the statistics showed that the annual business reached more than five million yuan. The factories operated day and night, and there was still more demand than supply. Business slump. In recent years, due to the world's economic recession and the depression of all industries, business has plummeted. Half of the factories have closed down one after another. Especially since the beginning of summer this year, eight or nine out of ten factories have stopped production due to unbearable losses. The decline in business is unprecedented. Reasons for the decline. In addition to the fact that the yarn tape industry has declined due to the economic recession of all industries, there are two major reasons that can lead to the demise of the yarn tape industry, namely: (1) Inferior goods are rampant. Today, Japanese yarn tape merchants are using Chinese street vendors to impersonate domestic goods and are aggressively selling them in this and other cities, and the sales of domestic yarn tape have been largely plundered by them. (2) Non-members carry and sell heavily sized yarn tape along the way (commonly known as "wild chicken running the streets"). The yarn tape is coated with the original sizing, as if it were bamboo. Often, dozens of yards of yarn tape are falsely claimed to be as many as four or five hundred yards, and the price is calculated as two or three hundred yards. It seems cheap, but in reality, it is a loss. Moreover, because the amount of sizing exceeds the amount of yarn, these people take advantage of the fact that the users of yarn tape in shops do not like to measure, so they often determine the value by weight. Therefore, those who are deceived are not uncommon. This kind of deception will affect the entire reputation of the yarn tape industry in the future. How can it be limited? The factory's street vendors, in order to maintain the credibility of the factories, are unwilling to use such despicable means to deal with customers, but they do not know that they have lost the psychology of the users. Therefore, the business has gradually declined. Remedial measures. In order to resist the dumping of inferior goods and correct the malpractices of business, the trade association issued domestic product certificates to its members last month and affixed them to the trademarks of their products to make it easier for users to identify them. At the same time, factory street vendors wear badges and are not allowed to falsely report the yardage to customers. They must trade honestly to maintain credit. On the one hand, they advise users to pay attention to the above-mentioned two points of certification when ordering yarn tape. If users can pay attention to this, they will not only avoid misusing inferior goods, but also avoid being deceived by the yardage. Then, the credibility of the yarn tape industry may be saved, and the future of domestic goods may be bright.</p>

Recently, the 57th Division of the Army organized this kind of medicine. Fei specially prepared 1,000 packs of malaria and dysentery medicine because the front-line soldiers fighting bandits were very hard. He took them to Guling to donate to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Chairman Xiong Shihui. Fei has returned to Shanghai from Gan since he was urged by patients in Shanghai.</p>

<p>A nephew and nephew compete to inherit the residence. Xue Hesheng from Baoshan, who lives at No. 1 Renmei Lane, Tongren Street, Xujiahui Town, Shanghai West, is 32 years old. His wife, Lu, has no children. Hesheng has three brothers. The eldest, Qingsheng, has passed away and only had one son, Shengfa, who is only 29 years old and is currently studying. The second, Pinsheng, also has no children. Only the three rooms have long been divided into separate meals. All the Caiyunlou Teahouse in Xujiahui is managed by the first and second rooms. Unfortunately, Lu passed away from illness the day before yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, Hesheng prepared a coffin at home for burial. According to local customs, when the coffin is buried, the corpse should be held into the coffin by his nephew Shengfa as a filial son. Hesheng did not allow Shengfa to inherit, but allowed his nephew Gu Wanliang to inherit. Therefore, the corpse was held in by Wanliang. Shengfa and Pinsheng were very dissatisfied. Since Gu inherited, the coffin should be placed on the Gu's grave, which caused a quarrel between the two sides. Hesheng then ordered someone to carry Lu's coffin to the top of Caiyunlou for placement. For a time, viewers gathered like clouds, and the road was blocked. Later, the police arrived to stop it, and then they retreated and temporarily placed it in the cemetery for burial.</p>

<p>After reviewing page three of your newspaper from August 14th, which contains the document from the education fee administrator Wu Baohuang and the director of the Education Bureau Zhu Zhaosheng presented to Chairman Chen of the provincial government requesting an investigation into the corruption of the land tax, it mentions "(abridged above) (Unexpectedly, the outside world learned of it, someone presented a complaint to the Department of Finance, and the county party headquarters then decided to send a letter to the county to investigate the matters presented by Lu Boxin,)" etc., which does not align with the facts.  After Lu Boxin came to the association to present the complaint, the association's 39th committee meeting decided to send two staff members, Shen Yuxuan and Jin Peihe, to investigate and report. Later, after receiving the report, the association's 44th committee meeting decided to submit it to the province for review and handling. This indicates that the association had already sent staff to investigate and respond to Lu Boxin's complaint, and the matter was reported to the province for review and handling.  There is a file that can be checked, and there is no room for alteration.  However, what Wu and Zhu stated in their document is quite alarming. The fact that the case was submitted to the province for review and handling differs greatly from a letter to the county to investigate.  We are writing specifically to request a correction to clarify the truth. We are grateful for your public spirit.

<h3 id="e181">On the Chaptered Novel Form <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>——In response to Mr. Tan Xueruo—— 1. A Disclaimer First, we must clarify to the readers that what we are discussing here regarding the chaptered novel form is its appearance, not its content. Originally, form is determined by content, and when we criticize chaptered novels, we must emphasize the dissection of the content, such as the monotonous plots involving gods and monsters, chivalry, and romantic tales of talented scholars and beautiful women. However, this is a very difficult task that cannot be fully explained in a short space, and Mr. Tan's intention is not in that area either, so we can only briefly omit it for now. 2. What is Wrong with the Chaptered Novel Form Mr. Tan asks: (What is wrong with the chaptered novel form? The descriptions of scenery and characters in chaptered novels are even more vivid and moving than those in modern novels). Our response is: (In terms of form, the chaptered novel, like its content, has significant flaws, namely— First, the endings of chaptered novels are always happy reunions. Readers often know what the second half of the story is about after reading only half of it. When writing about chivalry, there is always a loyal minister who has been framed by a treacherous official, so the chivalrous heroes rescue him, and as a result, the loyal minister is promoted. When writing about talented scholars and beautiful women, there is always a tragic fate, whether it is a sudden family disaster or a wealthy and powerful playboy who accidentally takes a liking to the beautiful woman, and then schemes to bring about the ruin of both families, but in the end, the talented scholar and the beautiful woman finally become a couple. This type of plot has an unchangeable stereotype, like children copying red characters from a model book, completely losing the creativity of art. Second, chaptered novels lack a rigorous structure. A lengthy novel of hundreds of thousands of words is just a collection of discontinuous events barely pieced together; you can extract any chapter or episode to create an independent short story without damaging the long novel itself. When writing a chaptered novel, the author does not need to select or trim the theme, as long as they rely on their own imagination and write whatever comes to mind. Therefore, all chaptered novels such as The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple and Seven Heroes and Five Gallants can be continued indefinitely and unconditionally. This is a type of weaving and mending, a kind of hodgepodge, and cannot be considered creative. Creation has a central idea, and the development of the story has a climax. A long creative work is not a collection of many short stories, and a short story is not a shortened long novel. Third, the characters in chaptered novels are not lively figures, but dead, deified characters. Robbers are always (with thick eyebrows and angry eyes), and talented scholars are always (with clear eyebrows and handsome eyes); the Peng Gong in The Cases of Peng Gong and the Shi Gong in The Cases of Shi Gong are completely identical, and the beauty of the ten beauties in The Ten Beauty Pictures cannot be distinguished. People often say that (people's hearts are different, each like their face), and we have never seen two absolutely similar people, but the authors of chaptered novels, like actors in a theater troupe, pre-sculpt fixed faces for treacherous officials, benevolent people, talented scholars, and beautiful women. Isn't this ridiculous! Moreover, when a character appears in a chaptered novel, a large set of descriptions is always added, telling the character's appearance and personality in advance, rather than expressing it through the development of the story. The characters in novels are the idealized images of people living in modern society. If someone ran up to you and told you their personality, background, and appearance all at once, how boring would that be)!) However, Mr. Tan thinks that this kind of description is moving. How to explain this? This is because: first, this kind of description makes it easy for the general public to understand, without the need for deep thought, and it is clear at a glance what kind of person it is and what is going on; second, this kind of description is consistently good at exaggerating, and when writing about a beautiful woman, they will definitely write her as an angel, which makes it easy to imprint a mark in the brains of people with a direct and dull sense; third, this kind of description makes it easiest to focus the reader's attention, for example, when writing about Wu Song fighting the tiger, they will focus solely on Wu Song, eliminating everyone else. In short, chaptered novels, whether in content or form, can cater to the low-level tastes of the general public, but catering to low-level tastes is by no means a good work. If Mr. Tan can read more new literary works, he will definitely understand how lacking in artistry chaptered novels are in form alone. 3. Can New Content be put into the Chaptered Novel Form Mr. Tan also asks: (If the chaptered novel form is used to describe new social life, can a good work be successfully created)? Our response is: (Impossible); because form is ultimately determined by content. Although some people are advocating the utilization of old forms, that must be when new forms have not yet been created, and the old forms are still the most suitable for expressing the new content. Now, the new novel form has already gained a wide readership, and the chaptered novel form is not suitable for expressing new social life, so why should we use the chaptered novel form to write novels? The current society is a very complex society, and the current era is a tragic era. We cannot mold the complex life into a model, and we cannot form the arduous human struggle into a happy ending. The characters in our novels are lively, not rigid, and the backgrounds in our novels are changing, not static. So, what is the relationship between the chaptered novel form and our creative work? If we insist on putting new content into it, the result will only be to corrupt the content, turning it into a grotesque creature that is neither a donkey nor a horse.</p>

<p>▲Mr. Xu reports on his European exhibition experience ▲Despite receiving honors, he remains modest. Six organizations, including the Shanghai Chinese Painting Society, Xinhua Art College, the Literary Tea Party, the Literary Monthly Society, Art Life, and the China Film Association Era Book Company, hosted a public banquet for the renowned painter Xu Beihong at the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge area at 7 PM last night. During the banquet, Mr. Xu provided a detailed report on his exhibition experience in various European countries, which is recorded below. ▲In addition to Mr. and Mrs. Xu, the guests present included Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan; Xie Shoukang, Supervisor; Li Dachao, Section Chief of the First Section of the Municipal Government; Xu Zhongnian, Professor at Central University; Yan Wenliang, President of Suzhou Art College; Hu Bozhou of Shen Bao; Wang Yachen, Dean of Studies at Xinhua Art College; Zhu Shaoping, President of the Global Student Association; Wang Pingling of the China Film Association; renowned painters Zhang Yuguang, Hua Lin, Zhu Yingpeng, Chen Baoyi, Chen Bin Hong, Lang Rusun, Yang Guangjun, Lang Jingshan, Liu Lin, and Li Qishi; and Lu Xizhen of the Hua'an Publishing Department, totaling over fifty people. After taking their seats, Hua Lin gave a speech explaining the significance of the banquet, followed by Mr. Xu, who described his exhibition experience in various European countries. ▲Mr. Xu's Speech After the chairman's report, Mr. Xu stood up and said that the motivation for this exhibition began in 1930. When I (Xu referred to himself) held a solo exhibition in the capital of Belgium, it was highly praised by the locals. Unexpectedly, Mr. Liu Dabai of the University of Lyon in France learned of this and insisted on moving the solo exhibition to Paris for viewing, which was very successful. I then thought of having a large-scale exhibition to promote cultural exchange between China and Europe and enhance China's international standing. So, I set off to return to China and solicited exquisite works from famous Chinese painters from all over the country to be transported to Europe. This was in January of last year. At the same time, the Ministry of Education, taking advantage of my trip to Europe, entrusted me with the task of inspecting art. However, after actually arriving in Europe, I never borrowed the name of the government or requested assistance. However, for a large-scale exhibition, a large amount of funds was indispensable. I was so poor that I was almost at a loss. Fortunately, Mr. Li Shizeng of the Central Committee, who was in France, learned of this and volunteered to provide the funds, so preparations could begin, with Mr. Liu Dabai in charge of the negotiations. Unexpectedly, just as everything was about to be completed, Mr. Li Shizeng suddenly returned to China due to some matter, and the funds were again unavailable. At that time, I was quite disheartened. Under such difficult circumstances, if it ended here, wouldn't it be a laughingstock to foreign countries? Therefore, I did not hesitate to do everything possible. With the sympathy and assistance of the domestic government and cultural organizations, it was finally successful, and I was exhausted. The first exhibition was held in Paris, which opened in May of last year. For a time, those who loved Chinese art and those who had never seen it before rushed from afar to visit, with the number of visitors reaching over 30,000. As a result, the printed catalog was reprinted three times within ten days, selling for two yuan each, and still felt that the supply could not meet the demand. The exhibition was originally scheduled for one month, but it was extended by half a month before it closed. The grand occasion during that time is self-evident. Therefore, the Japanese expatriates in France were extremely jealous and instigated major newspapers to conduct counter-propaganda. Even if they didn't say anything bad, they at least didn't express any feelings. However, this kind of petty behavior was not enough to cause any damage. Although this was the first exhibition of Chinese art in Europe, it not only left a deep impression on the visitors but also caused a sensation in various European countries. Various countries sent telegrams one after another inviting the exhibition to their countries. The French National Museum even specially opened a room to purchase and collect twelve paintings. At the same time, the members of the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee exhibited my personal works in Brussels. After the exhibition closed, it went to the German Art Exhibition for sixteen days, which opened in November of last year. It then went to the Milan Royal Palace in Italy for exhibition. Major newspapers and magazines published reviews and praises, and local films also showed news of the art exhibition, which can be said to be the most widespread. At the same time, Rome also sent a telegram inviting the exhibition. Unexpectedly, after all the conditions had been negotiated, a telegram was received from Moscow inviting the exhibition to be held in their country in May of this year. At that time, I was quite troubled, because with the time being so tight, if I wanted to hold the exhibition in Rome, I would have to give up Russia, and if I wanted to go to Russia, I would have to give up Rome. However, I was unwilling to give up the greater for the smaller, so I decided to go to Russia. Upon arriving in Russia, the Cultural Committee immediately sent personnel to welcome me and take care of everything. After two weeks of preparation, the exhibition opened on time. The location was the Historical Museum on Red Square, the largest parade ground in Russia. To the left was Lenin's tomb, and to the right was the location of the Russian government. With all kinds of conveniences, the grand occasion was unprecedented, and it was a great success. I was also relieved. At the same time, I received invitations from two other places in Russia. I first went to the Lanining District to exhibit. The director of the museum also displayed forty large cabinets of treasured Chinese antiques and books in a room and insisted that I donate several paintings to them. So, I left twelve paintings to be kept there, and the Russian government was willing to exchange them for thirteen famous paintings of Tolstoy and other celebrities. After the exhibition closed, I immediately returned to China. The process was roughly like this, and the success of this exhibition was not something that I could achieve alone. It was all due to the assistance of famous domestic painters. Whether it was successful or not is there for all to see. I am not complacent and hope that my colleagues present will not hesitate to give me guidance and continue to work hard to promote China's international standing. In the end, Mr. Li of the Chinese Painting Society and Wang Yachen gave speeches, and the Hua'an Publishing Department distributed a copy of China's beautiful magazines to each guest. The event ended at around 9 PM. The Global Student Association held a meeting yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Second Discussion Meeting for Students Studying Abroad <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>▲Guiding Precautions for Traveling ▲Organizing Student Groups for the US and UK The Global Chinese Student Association held a second discussion meeting for students studying in Europe and America at the New Asia Hotel at 4 PM yesterday. More than forty students who were going to study in Europe and America attended, and they were warmly welcomed by Wu Deyin and Yang Baoqian. In addition to providing guidance on travel, this discussion meeting also discussed the organization of student groups. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e191">Reporting Travel Precautions <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The meeting began at 4 PM, presided over by Zhu Shaoping, who reported on the precautions for traveling, stating that the United States is currently rejecting Chinese laborers, and there are strict restrictions on Chinese entering the country. Those who are traveling to the country for the first time should be careful on their journey, otherwise they may experience unexpected pain. The first thing to pay attention to is personal health. If you have an eye disease, you should treat it immediately, otherwise, once it is detected, you will have to be sent to Shanghai Island or back to your country. Secondly, you should not bring too many luggage and books, as the country's inspection of books is very strict. Any books that involve politics will be arrested. In short, whether going to the US or the UK, the difficulties of traveling are unavoidable. I believe that student groups should be organized and act in unison, so that the other party will be more convenient.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Organizing Student Groups for the Grant and Ruienpura <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>After the chairman's report, the organization of student groups was discussed, and it was unanimously passed. Zhang Mushan, Sun Shengzeng, Lei Zuowen, Zhou Qingxiang, Wang Jiazeng, Pei Xiheng, and Xu Chuanjing were immediately nominated as members of the Grant Student Group, and Chen Yongling, Yu Dayin, Wu Qizhi, Wu Zaidong, Xia Jianbai, and Yang Renpian were nominated as members of the Ruienpura Student Group, with Chen Yongling designated as the general manager.</p>

<p>The Global Student Association sent a letter to its member Guo Taiqi, the minister to the UK, to assist the students going to the UK this time. The original letter is as follows: Dear Sir, I am writing to introduce Mr. So-and-so, who is going to the UK to study. Because he is going abroad for the first time and is unfamiliar with the place, I am writing to introduce him to you. Please assist him when he comes to visit you and provide guidance on everything. Sincerely, Zhu Shaoping, General Manager of the Global Chinese Student Association. The association will also send letters to the student associations of various universities to welcome the students going to the US.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Little Western Paradise <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Introducing Little Western Paradise - Editor</p>
<p>Nowadays, most writers are shouting slogans, going to the people. Yes, we very much approve of writers going to the people, writing something for the people. But if we examine carefully, how many writers actually go to the people? Some even shout about going to the people while staying in tall Western-style houses. And cafes, dog racing tracks, Paramount dance halls, Grand Cinema… these are the places they frequent. Perhaps this is the people for them.</p>
<p>What is stated above is an undeniable fact. Therefore, although there is a constant emergence of folk literature, writing that truly reflects the situation of the people is not nonexistent, but it is truly scarce. Since we hope to see writings about the people appear, we cannot but encourage writers to go to the people. And Mr. Zhang Henshui is someone to be encouraged.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's trip to the Northwest this time, staying in Shaanxi and Gansu for about three months. In that place isolated from material civilization, living in cave dwellings, drinking turbid soup, unable to get close to the ordinary people, he felt that the Northwest's folk customs are another world in China. In this world, he discovered that what Easterners consider an extremely ordinary life, people there consider to be heaven. What Easterners are unwilling to live in even for a day, people there are willing to spend their whole lives in. He saw this contradictory fact, which is excellent material for a novel, and so he used this material to construct a long novel called Little Western Paradise.</p>
<p>This novel will follow immediately after Northeast Four Company Commander. As for Mr. Zhang's works, readers naturally recognize them, so there is no need for us to exaggerate. What we dare to introduce is that this Little Western Paradise is definitely not something made up behind closed doors, but a truly realistic novel of the Northwest folk customs.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Old Pan's Philosophy of Life <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Chengxing</p>
<p>Old Pan is a short, fat man, full of excess flesh and humor, often making people burst into laughter. He can turn someone who is confident and righteous into someone speechless and lacking in reason. He makes you suffer without being able to complain, so no one dares to easily converse with him.</p>
<p>He is good at socializing and adapting to circumstances. For example, if the other person has learned boxing, he will also wave his clumsy hands to put on a show. If the other person has studied medicine, he will also speak off the cuff, saying what medicine to use for a cold, what medicine to use for typhoid fever. Even for pulmonary tuberculosis, which Western and Chinese doctors alike consider to have more bad signs than good, it seems easy for him to solve, and he gives reasons why it is not difficult to solve.</p>
<p>His eyes are bright and piercing, able to discern the other person's character, behavior, and thoughts… A secret that a friend of many years has not yet seen through, he only needs three or four hours to uncover.</p>
<p>Many young people who have not yet entered society prostrate themselves before him, so they often go to ask him for the secrets of life. He naturally accepts the questions of those who come and imparts the method to others. Summarizing it, it can be divided into the following two points: (1) Extend oneself to others and please people. (2) Understand the other person's psychology and then use flattery and bootlicking. If you ask him if there are any other methods, then he will quickly answer: (Enough, enough!)</p>
<p>He often tells people this story:</p>
<p>(There was a person who loved to eat snails. A philanthropist advised him not to eat them, because eating them once would kill countless small lives. They would all go to the Jade Emperor to report him, and he would suffer living punishment in the underworld! He did not object, and the philanthropist walked away with a victorious smile. Soon after, he bought four loads of snails, released three loads, and ate one load himself. His reasoning was: there are three loads of snails praising me before the Jade Emperor, but only one load cursing me.)</p>
<p>Old Pan has now become successful and prosperous. But his philosophy of life is very difficult to understand!</p>

<p>General Deng Tiemei was trapped in Shenyang Prison. The enemy offered him a banquet of wine and food, but he refused to eat, vowing to die. This reminded me of what Zhang Suiyang said to Nan Jiyun in those days: "One Nan and Eight, a man dies! I cannot be bent by injustice!" Truly a splendid reflection from beginning to end. Looking towards the Northeast, I respectfully pay homage to General Deng.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Up and Down <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Fu</p>
<p>There are many types of houses in Shanghai; "up and down" is one of them.</p>
<p>An "up and down" doesn't seem to have many rooms. However, if you encounter a shrewd second landlord, then one room becomes two rooms, two rooms become four rooms. If the second landlord doesn't know how to divide like this, how can he make money from this to support his family?</p>
<p>Older "up and downs" generally have these rooms: the living room, the upper floor of the living room, the garret, and the kitchen lean-to. In addition, there is a courtyard and a sun deck.</p>
<p>The living room can be divided into the back of the living room and the front of the living room. The back of the living room can also have a mezzanine. The kitchen lean-to can be divided into two… Divided like this, an "up and down" can accommodate as many people as a "two up and two down" or a "three up and three down".</p>
<p>These small rooms in the "up and downs" are either the hideouts of "playboys" or the residences of "writers"; either "Ningo gentlemen" who are always nagging, or "lai be" (come on) Jiangbei comrades. In short, the residents of "up and downs" are all remarkable people.</p>
<p>Although a second landlord of an "up and down" can make money, it also takes some skill, such as how to deal with tenants who can't pay the rent, and the ability to change direction with the wind.</p>
<p>In addition, "up and downs" can also add a bit of business for the fire brigade.</p>
<p>Finally, let me shout:</p>
<p>("Up and down" Long live!)</p>
<h3 id="e221">The Scented Records of Imperial Life <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>According to our planned itinerary, the Empress Dowager would have her first dinner on the train after the train reached Fengtai. After dinner, she would rest briefly and then drive straight to Tianjin, hoping to arrive in Tianjin before the Empress Dowager prepared to retire. Because according to the idea of Qing Shan, the Minister of the Interior, it was not appropriate for someone as noble as the Empress Dowager to stay overnight in any village or town. Although in fact, the Empress Dowager would not get off the train, and it would not make much difference whether the train was parked in a village or a big city, Qing Shan always thought this was very inappropriate.</p>
<p>No matter how slowly our train traveled, Fengtai finally arrived! And our dinner was also neatly served at the same time. Normally, it takes at most thirty or forty minutes for a train to go from Beijing to Fengtai, but we actually traveled for more than two hours, which can be said to have broken the world record for the slowest train speed. But for the Empress Dowager, it didn't matter whether it took two hours or two days. Anyway, she had plenty of time. Today passed, there was tomorrow, tomorrow passed, there was the day after tomorrow, and the day after that… She simply never thought about how much value time had; and since she herself was on the train, the entire government was equivalent to being brought along, and all major military and national plans could be decided and implemented in the same way. Therefore, she paid even less attention to time!</p>
<p>Because she did not know how to value her own time, she was also very indifferent to the relationship between others and time. Just take our trip to Fengtian this time, the speed of the train seemed to only affect the Empress Dowager herself or us, but in fact it affected countless people. For example, if you happened to want to go from Tianjin to Beiping at that time, or from Tianjin to Jinzhou, in normal times, as long as you had money to buy a ticket, it would not be difficult for you to arrive in a moment; but at this time, when the Empress Dowager's imperial train was pacing leisurely on the rails, you would be out of luck. No matter how much money you had, or how important and urgent your affairs were, don't even think about taking any train! Fortunately, you have plenty of time, just wait! One day, two days, three days… Waiting like this, one day they will let you pass. Perhaps you are too impatient and cannot wait for the Empress Dowager's special train to reach Fengtian, and you have already died of anxiety. Isn't that just looking for trouble?</p>

<p>— Yang'an</p>
<p>▲On the Road to Nanxun</p>
<p>The mighty Zhang and Gong Rivers once changed banners,</p>
<p>But the silk buildings remain unharmed and stand tall.</p>
<p>Whose will awaken the tragic sight of devastation?</p>
<p>Improving the countryside and wealth come first.</p>
<p>▲Jiujiang</p>
<p>The pipa on the river is unwilling to be idle,</p>
<p>I make a short stop in Xunyang, gazing at Mount Lu.</p>
<p>Casually discussing Sima, my blue shirt is wet,</p>
<p>The water and mountain scenery dispel all sorrow.</p>
<p>▲First Ascent of Mount Lu</p>
<p>Clouds roll back, revealing a thousand peaks,</p>
<p>Mountains hide deep, ten thousand trees obscure.</p>
<p>Clothes cool as the wind darkly襲,</p>
<p>The air is crisp, the sun sinks in the west.</p>
<p>Birds happily dropping strings of pearls and jade,</p>
<p>Waterfalls flow, playing the zither and lute.</p>
<p>The river and sky are truly vast and magnificent,</p>
<p>I lean on the railing, gazing and chanting for a long time.</p>
<p>▲View from the Imperial Stele Pavilion</p>
<p>A thousand peaks are sealed by white clouds,</p>
<p>Ten thousand valleys are hidden by deep pines.</p>
<p>The Yangtze River's waves are broad and right,</p>
<p>The distant cassia trees' mist is initially thick.</p>
<p>The ancient temple's bell sounds are silent,</p>
<p>The vast sky's birds are idly unhurried,</p>
<p>Last night's heavy rain was sufficient,</p>
<p>Ten thousand households see joyful faces.</p>
<p>▲The Fog of Guling</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain, the heat is like roasting taro,</p>
<p>On the mountain, wrapped in quilts, the cold is like iron.</p>
<p>The same human world, two different skies,</p>
<p>The world's warmth and cold cannot be spoken.</p>
<p>The dense fog blots out people,</p>
<p>The strange peaks and spiritual valleys are traceless.</p>
<p>Sitting idly is like an meditating monk,</p>
<p>Choosing scenic spots and writing poetry at my desk.</p>
<p>This trip must be to see the fog,</p>
<p>The clouds and smoke change a thousand ways,</p>
<p>In an instant, they seem to engulf the sky,</p>
<p>In a moment, the sky becomes dark,</p>
<p>Quietly listening, the wind howls even more wildly,</p>
<p>Disordered clouds scatter in all directions across ten thousand mountains.</p>
<p>I still have the heart to climb mountains and ridges,</p>
<p>But I sit alone, a melancholy traveler.</p>
<p>A patch of clear cloud passes over the mountain,</p>
<p>The sunlight faintly reveals, pressing against the forest,</p>
<p>The mountain spirit seems to open a convenient door,</p>
<p>Allowing your footprints to roam the streams and valleys,</p>
<p>There are mountains, there is water, and there is poetic thought,</p>
<p>The mountain people's nature is naturally aloof.</p>
<p>Local Customs Notes</p>
<h3 id="e224">Records of Miao Customs (4) <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Jue</p>
<p>In addition to bird guns, the Miao people also have the skill of throwing stones, which they learn from childhood. When children have nothing to do, they gather together to point at a certain tree or branch and throw stones at it. The one who hits is considered skilled, so they send stones quickly and powerfully, and can take flying birds in the air from dozens of feet away. Whenever they engage in combat with people, if their bullets are used up, they will pick up stones and hit people, and the injuries are also severe.</p>
<p>The Miao people's so-called "fighting vendettas" involves first inviting dozens or hundreds of relatives and friends, telling them the reason, and after eating and drinking, promising to sacrifice themselves, which is called "helping soldiers." The two armies face each other, first firing fire guns, with Miao women following behind, loading bullets into the guns. After firing, they each wield long pole guns to advance. If they don't win, they draw short knives to engage. If they still don't win, they hug each other with daggers and cut each other. When government soldiers encounter them, they gently persuade them to disperse. Those who are injured or killed are immediately buried, without reporting to the government. If the government knows and goes to investigate, they will not be told the burial place. After the two families fight, they count the corpses to offset each other. In addition to offsetting one life for one life, if there are more corpses on one side, then the lives are considered human lives, and they demand cattle, horses, and property as compensation, which is called "inverting the bone price." The price depends on the wealth or poverty of the murderer, ranging from three hundred and thirty taels to fifty-five taels for the rich, and decreasing from forty-four taels to twenty-two taels for the poor. Among them, old cows, thin horses, torn clothes, and old items can all be used as offsets. Because the Miao people value property and despise life, the person who presides over the alliance is called "Back Arrow," and the person who mediates is called "Toothman," also called "Traveler." If the government does not follow Miao customs and insists on compensation, then killing one person will add one enemy. The son or grandson of the deceased plants a tree next to the grave to record their hatred, and they kill each other in retaliation, leading to endless proliferation. Therefore, there is a saying that "Miao vendettas never end."</p>
<p>When the Miao people encounter floods, droughts, or epidemics, they also know divination, called "throwing wood divination." They split wood into two and throw it on the ground, praying for its upward, downward, forward, and backward orientation. It is also called "fishing comb divination," using a thread to suspend a comb and observe its direction. It is also called "egg divination," placing an egg in a container and cursing it in the sun. After cursing, the egg settles, and they use coal to mark its left and right sides, cook it, and divide it with a thread, observing the thickness of the yolk and white. It is also called "divining with a chicken," holding a chicken in the wild, inserting five-colored paper flags into the ground, burning joss paper, and beating a bamboo tube to pray. Then they cook the chicken and take two shanks, using bamboo strips to measure the depth of the bone holes. The auspiciousness, inauspiciousness, good fortune, and misfortune are all divined from these several methods.</p>
<p>The Miao people believe in ghosts, so they regard belief in ghosts as an important matter, either once a year or once every three years, costing up to a hundred gold or dozens of gold. Those who are poor and unable to afford it sell their property and pawn their clothes to do it. Therefore, from October to November, after the farming season is over, they do great ghost rituals, with various names such as "doing rice ghost," "doing thunder ghost," and "doing general ghost." When Miao people are sick, they always say there is a ghost, and they hire shamans to pray, brew wine, and slaughter livestock, inviting relatives and neighbors to drink blessings. This is also a kind of "doing ghost." If they don't get better after the sacrifice, they attribute it to fate. After the sacrifice, they insert a sign at the door. If someone unknowingly enters the door by mistake, they say they have startled the ghost and must compensate for the expenses and repeat the sacrifice as before before it is over.</p>
<p>On days with Zi, Yin, and Wu branches in May, the Miao people sacrifice to their ancestors. The day before, they tie the feet of cattle, horses, dogs, and other livestock with wood, making them unable to fly or run, and place them in a secluded place. After the sacrifice, the whole family, old and young, avoids entering the mountain cave, called "dodging ghosts." On this day, they do not light fires, do not eat or drink, and do not speak when they meet each other on the road. They do not ask questions about thieves and robbers. They dare not turn over when lying down at night, and dare not touch each other when mosquitoes bite, fearing that the ghosts will notice.</p>
<p>Before the Lesser Heat solar term, the Chen and Si days are forbidden days, when they worship the Heavenly King, or call the Heavenly King the White Emperor Heavenly King. They forbid slaughtering and selling, and stop fishing and hunting. They do not wear red, and do not make music. After the ban is lifted and sacrifices are offered, they return to normal days.</p>
<p>When the Miao people accidentally encounter injustice and cannot clear themselves, they must report to the Heavenly King Temple, make oaths, prick cat blood, drip it into wine, and drink it to pledge their hearts, called "eating blood." After three days, they must slaughter livestock to repay their vows, called "repenting sins and doing ghosts." When they enter the temple, they crawl on their knees and tremble, daring not look up. Those who are in the wrong linger and dare not drink, repenting their sins and abandoning their vows. Because no matter how big or small the matter is, after eating blood, there will be no regrets. When the government deals with Miao people's lawsuits, if they cannot be fair, they order them to eat blood, and they fear it. Because the Miao people fear ghosts more than the law.</p>
<p>The Miao people do not value human morality, and wild mating is not prohibited. Marriage and weddings are simple. Those with a little property often marry several wives, so breeding is extremely easy. In the previous dynasty, they were repeatedly attacked, and the grass and birds were slaughtered. But the remnants in the mountain caves, in less than a few decades, were again full of forests and valleys, called Miao, or perhaps that is the meaning of easy to produce? (The End)</p>

<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Formulating National Hospital Standards to Improve Substandard Hospitals</p>
<p>Domestic hospitals consist of public, private, and church-affiliated institutions. These vary greatly in category and quality. Public hospitals are differentiated by national, provincial, and county levels. Private and church-affiliated hospitals are divided into Chinese and foreign entities. Examining their content, some are merely private clinics masquerading as hospitals, while others use hospitals as a means of proselytization. Consequently, inadequate equipment, ineffective treatment, and incidents of harming patients are frequently reported. After careful consideration of the reasons, it is evident that the uneven quality of hospitals stems from the lack of uniform national standards. Without established standards, unscrupulous opportunists can exploit the situation. It is hoped that the government will promptly formulate and implement national hospital standards, ordering non-compliant institutions to improve or face strict closure. In this way, inferior institutions will be eliminated, and superior ones will emerge, weeds will be removed, and thriving crops will grow.</p>
<p>(F) Restricting the Emergence of Old-Style Doctors to Achieve Unified Medical Administration</p>
<p>Medicine should not be divided by nationality but by scientific and unscientific methods. The term "new Chinese medicine" is defined in contrast to "old medicine." The general public knows that old medicine is a major enemy of science. While the government promotes new medicine, it hesitates to abolish old medicine. This dualistic approach creates division in policy, hindering the unification of Chinese administration. Some argue that eliminating old medicine would increase unemployment due to the large number of practitioners. However, this issue can be easily resolved by surveying and registering current old-style doctors, allowing them to continue practicing but prohibiting them from taking on apprentices. Thus, the number of old-style doctors will gradually decrease, eventually disappearing entirely. Government medical administration will become less fragmented and move toward unification. It is up to the government to act quickly.</p>
<p>(G) Establishing Standardized Provincial, County, and Township Hospitals</p>
<p>Those who speak of people's livelihood often lament the inability of the poor to afford medical care, blaming high doctor's fees. However, the issue of poverty and illness cannot be resolved by a few private practitioners. The responsibility lies with the government. The only solution is to establish more hospitals. Besides private ones, there are very few national hospitals, leaving the impoverished without access to treatment. It is hoped that the government will establish standardized hospitals in each province, county, township, and town, providing free treatment to the poor and sick. Hospital doctors differ from clinic doctors. Clinic doctors see an average of only ten to twenty patients daily, while hospital doctors treat around a hundred. Clinic doctors must charge fees to earn a living, while hospitals, being purely public and charitable, can offer free treatment to the poor. This widespread benefit yields significant results, surpassing all other good deeds.</p>
<p>(H) Restricting Foreign Doctors' Practice to Preserve the Rights and Interests of Chinese Doctors</p>
<p>Due to China's weakness, it lacks the power to prevent foreign incursions, including the practice of foreign doctors in China. In Western countries, foreign doctors face strict regulations and must pass rigorous examinations and investigations before being permitted to practice. Governments have a responsibility to protect the professions of their people and ensure their rights and interests are not infringed upon by foreign forces. This principle applies not only to doctors but to all professions. China has adopted an open-door policy, and its people deeply revere foreigners. The government has never imposed restrictions, and the people welcome foreigners, allowing foreign doctors to encroach upon the territory of Chinese doctors. Many foreign doctors practicing in China lack status or are unqualified in their own countries. They exploit their countries' influence and view China as their sole target for invasion. Upon arriving in China, they expand their publicity to gain the trust of Chinese people while undermining the reputation of the new Chinese medical community to monopolize rights and interests. Their knowledge is often rudimentary, and their intentions are greedy and ruthless. Entrusting the lives of our people to those who are not of our kind is harmful. It is hoped that the government will promptly enact clear regulations restricting the practice of foreign doctors, subjecting all foreign doctors to rigorous examinations and thorough investigations and requiring fluency in Chinese. In doing so, the lives of the people and the rights and interests of Chinese doctors can be protected.</p>
<p>(I) Promulgating Laws to Protect Doctors</p>
<p>Medicine is a profession of utmost importance to the health of the nation. Governments worldwide have stringent regulations for the training of doctors and protect practicing physicians. However, the Chinese government does not. While laws protect lawyers and government administrators, doctors lack such protection, which is incomprehensible. In recent years, doctors have been unjustly accused and illegally arrested by authorities. They lack special protection and are even denied basic human rights. Are all my colleagues not feeling threatened? The government may not wish to develop new medicine, but if it wants China to have independent new medicine, it must promulgate laws to protect new medicine as an urgent priority.</p>
<p>(J) Medical Organizations</p>
<p>Medical organizations gather all members of the medical community to pursue their shared interests. The government should allow medical organizations to offer advice and urge implementation. Medical organizations have the right to act directly when the government cannot or should not. These are summarized below.</p>

<p>(36) Intestinal Tuberculosis (Intestinal TB)</p>
<p>(Question) What is intestinal tuberculosis, and how does it occur?</p>
<p>(Answer) Intestinal tuberculosis, or intestinal TB, is usually caused by swallowing sputum coughed up during pulmonary tuberculosis, which contains tubercle bacilli that then invade the intestines. It can also occur primarily in children who drink milk from tuberculous cows or milk from tuberculous mothers.</p>
<p>(Question) Where in the intestines does intestinal tuberculosis develop?</p>
<p>(Answer) It first forms millet-sized tubercles in the follicular layer, which later merge and break down into ulcers; or it causes tumor-like thickening in the cecum wall, or it develops into ulcers, abscesses, or fistulas in the rectum.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms of intestinal tuberculosis?</p>
<p>(Answer) It usually develops gradually, with persistent diarrhea, two to three times a day, with soft or thin, porridge-like stools mixed with grayish-white or yellowish particles and undigested food residue. Microscopic examination reveals pus cells, fat, and fat crystals, and confirms occult bleeding.</p>
<p>(Question) What symptoms occur when the rectum is affected by tuberculosis?</p>
<p>(Answer) When the rectum is affected by tuberculosis, in addition to the above symptoms, there is also severe tenesmus.</p>
<p>(Question) What symptoms are found on abdominal palpation?</p>
<p>(Answer) Palpation reveals rumbling sounds, similar to chronic enteritis, in the right iliac fossa, and tenderness is reported.</p>
<p>(Question) Does healing of intestinal ulcers result in scar formation?</p>
<p>(Answer) Yes. It often forms scars that leave the intestinal lumen narrowed.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the dangers if ulcers do not heal for a long time?</p>
<p>(Answer) It often leads to severe bleeding or intestinal perforation.</p>
<p>(Question) If tuberculosis occurs in the ileocecal region, are there any abnormalities in the lower right abdomen?</p>
<p>(Answer) At this time, a hard and palpable mass can be felt in the lower right abdomen for a long time.</p>
<p>(Question) Is the appetite of patients with intestinal tuberculosis impaired?</p>
<p>(Answer) Not necessarily, but they gradually become emaciated, develop anemia, malnutrition, and weakness.</p>
<p>(Question) As the disease progresses, what dangerous symptoms appear?</p>
<p>(Answer) Later, as the condition worsens, watery stools are excreted, consistently containing a large amount of fat.</p>
<p>(Question) How dangerous is intestinal tuberculosis?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is very dangerous and mostly incurable.</p>
<p>(Question) How should this disease be treated?</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>(Answer) For diarrhea, give milk or thin porridge. The abdomen must be kept warm. The only medications are various astringents, such as tannic acid preparations, bismuth subnitrate, or absorbent drugs like charcoal. Sometimes surgery can be performed to remove tuberculosis of the ileocecal region, but this must be done early. For rectal tuberculosis, curettage can be performed to remove it.</p>
<p>(Question) Are there any preventive measures?</p>
<p>(Answer) Prevention of intestinal tuberculosis involves not drinking milk from tuberculous cows, and people with pulmonary tuberculosis must not swallow sputum into their intestines.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Protection of Children's Teeth (Part 1) <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Modern civilization is advancing, and medicine is developing. Our country, once known as the "sick man of Asia," is gradually recognizing the importance of hygiene. Schools are increasingly emphasizing health education, and members of society are paying attention to cleanliness in diet, daily life, health promotion, and disease prevention. However, oral hygiene and dental protection have not yet received adequate attention. A lack of oral hygiene and unhealthy teeth not only hinder digestion but also provide a breeding ground for microorganisms, significantly impacting health. Chinese people are generally negligent in brushing and protection and often delay treatment even when cavities develop, allowing them to worsen. They seek medical attention only when inflammation, suppuration, swelling, and pain force them to do so, often sacrificing their teeth. Chewing is impaired, the stomach and intestines suffer, and health is harmed. The harm to health progresses gradually and imperceptibly. It accumulates over time and becomes severe. People often suffer from tooth problems for years, being harmed daily without realizing it, lamenting the gradual decline of their bodies while remaining unaware of the root cause. Since dental problems are not noticed and their harm is not easily detected, dental problems are widespread throughout the country, imperceptibly undermining the physical strength of the Chinese people. This is a major health issue for the entire nation, and patriotic individuals must loudly call for attention to awaken society.</p>
<p>Dental protection should begin in childhood. Decayed or misaligned milk teeth can significantly affect adult teeth, and decayed milk teeth and an unclean mouth can easily cause various dangerous childhood oral diseases, such as various forms of stomatitis and Vincent's angina, which can be life-threatening.</p>
<p>Which parents do not love their children and wish them to become intelligent and strong young adults? They are meticulous in protecting their children's clothing, food, and daily life, but they neglect their teeth, allowing them to develop naturally, thinking it unimportant. They allow dental problems to develop, preventing adult teeth from growing properly, resulting in lifelong suffering. This is regrettable. Therefore, before discussing adult dental problems, I will first write this article, detailing children's oral hygiene, protection of milk teeth, and development of good habits. If these are followed and implemented, it will not only benefit childhood but also lay the foundation for lifelong healthy teeth.</p>
<p>Oral Hygiene for Newborn Infants</p>
<p>To clean an infant's mouth, it is best to use a soft cloth strip or sterile cotton wool wrapped around the index finger, soaked in a 2% boric acid solution, and gently wipe the infant's mouth several times a day. As the infant grows, this rubbing can be continued, not only to keep the mouth clean but also to stimulate the growth of milk teeth and alleviate congestion and swelling during teething.</p>
<p>If an infant experiences difficulty or pain during teething, teething drops can be purchased from a pharmacy and applied frequently to relieve pain. This is crucial because prolonged difficult teething can easily lead to indigestion, which can quickly worsen and cause physical weakness. If the above methods are ineffective, a dentist should be consulted early to surgically pierce the teething site, which will immediately alleviate the child's pain and restore calmness.</p>
<p>Functions of Milk Teeth</p>
<p>(1) Children use their milk teeth to learn to chew food, which will enable them to use adult teeth naturally in the future.</p>
<p>(2) Milk teeth guide the tongue, making speaking and moving food easier.</p>
<p>(3) Milk teeth help the muscles of the lips and cheeks to maintain facial appearance. (When elderly people lose their teeth, their lip and cheek muscles contract inward because there is no tooth support.)</p>
<p>(4) Milk teeth maintain the natural shape and size of the alveolar arch, so that the alignment of future adult teeth is neat and aesthetically pleasing. Eruption times of milk teeth:</p>
<p>(1) Central incisors: about 6 to 8 months after birth</p>
<p>(2) Lateral incisors: about 8 to 10 months</p>
<p>(3) First molars: about 10 to 16 months</p>
<p>(4) Canines: about 16 to 20 months</p>
<p>(5) Second molars: about 20 to 30 months</p>
<p>Eruption times of permanent teeth:</p>
<p>(1) First molars: about 5 to 7 years</p>
<p>(2) Central incisors: about 6 to 8 years</p>
<p>(3) Lateral incisors: about 7 to 9 years</p>
<p>(4) First premolars: about 8 to 10 years</p>
<p>(5) Mandibular canines: about 9 to 11 years</p>
<p>(6) Second premolars: about 10 to 12 years</p>
<p>(7) Maxillary canines: about 11 to 13 years</p>
<p>(8) Second molars: about 12 to 14 years</p>
<p>(9) Third molars: erupt after age 17</p>
<p>The above two tables are calculated based on full-term infants. However, due to differences in physical strength, the timing of teething may vary slightly.</p>
<p>Adverse Consequences of Early Loss of Milk Teeth</p>
<p>We already know the schedule for tooth replacement listed above. When a tooth becomes loose at a certain time, the loose tooth should be extracted to allow the adult tooth to erupt. If a tooth is lost several years before the tooth replacement period, it is called early loss. The adverse consequences are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) There are a total of twenty milk teeth, each with its own specific task. If ten are lost early, the remaining ten must be forced to take on the work of the original twenty milk teeth. They will inevitably be overwhelmed and exhausted.</p>
<p>(2) If milk teeth are extracted during the tooth replacement period, the adult teeth will erupt naturally, neatly and beautifully. If they are lost early, the milk teeth in front of and behind the gap will inevitably tilt towards the middle gap. When the future adult teeth erupt, they will be slanted inward or outward or buried underneath because there is no space, which is very unaesthetic.</p>
<p>(3) When teeth are misaligned, their upper and lower occlusion will be improper, and they will be difficult to brush, easily harboring dirt. Cavities often develop as a result.</p>
<p>(4) The more uneven the mandibular teeth, the shorter the alveolar bone becomes, resulting in a receding chin. This transforms a robust and majestic face into a declining and listless expression. If the upper jaw does not recede and the lower jaw recedes, the upper incisors will protrude, and the upper lip will also protrude outward. This is not only unattractive but also easily leads to the bad habit of breathing through the mouth.</p>
<p>(5) If maxillary milk teeth are lost early, the maxillary alveolar bone can also become narrow. As a result, the nasal cavity shrinks, and nasopharyngeal lymphoid hyperplasia and other respiratory diseases are likely to occur.</p>
<p>In view of these five adverse consequences, we must retain children's milk teeth until the tooth replacement period. Therefore, each milk tooth should never be extracted lightly unless it is decayed, suppurated, and untreatable. Parents must pay attention to the tooth replacement schedule listed above for reference.</p>

<p>(11) Adenoid Hypertrophy</p>
<p>(This disease is caused by the gradual proliferation of the adenoids in the nasopharynx)</p>
<p>This disease is also known as adenoid vegetation. The original name is Hyperplasie der Racheutonsille or Adeuoide Vegetation. This disease is entirely a childhood illness. It occurs most frequently during the school-age period from five to fifteen years. It is rare in adults. Clinically, it appears to have a hereditary relationship. For example, in one family, three or four children will develop this disease one after another. Statistically speaking, it does not discriminate between males and females, nor between rich and poor.</p>
<p>The most important and obvious symptom of this disease is nasal obstruction, which leads to (1) snoring after sleep, (2) restless sleep, and (3) only using the mouth to breathe (because the nasopharynx is blocked by adenoid hypertrophy, obstructing the nasal cavity and preventing nasal breathing). If these phenomena occur for a long time, a specific facial appearance will develop, namely (1) a constantly open mouth, (2) relaxed facial muscles, (3) a lack of facial expression, (4) a flat nasal bridge, and small nostrils, (5) erosion around the nostrils (due to eczema caused by nasal fluid irritation). In medicine, this phenomenon is called adenoid facies (Habitus Adeuoides). In addition, mental development is also slow, memory declines, laziness sets in, and headaches and head heaviness occur. These are all due to nasal obstruction. It should also be noted that bed-wetting in children is often caused by this disease.</p>
<p>The most common complications are (1) ear diseases, such as Eustachian tube obstruction, chronic otitis media catarrhalis, and acute or chronic suppurative otitis media. Therefore, children often experience tinnitus, hearing loss, and ear discharge. (2) Children are prone to catching colds and coughs, which often lead to respiratory diseases. (3) Because there is a constant flow of secretions from the pharynx, the mucous membrane is irritated, often causing pharyngitis. Children often experience a dry throat, sore throat, cough, etc. When we doctors encounter such children, examination of the hard palate often reveals deformation. This deformation is that the hard palate is particularly narrow and long, and the incisors protrude forward. If this condition persists for a long time, the development of the rib cage will also be affected, and lung diseases can occur at any time. Children suffering from this disease with the above-mentioned symptoms, if not treated, will gradually experience poor nutrition and impaired overall development, exhibiting anemic symptoms. At this time, in medicine, it is called adenoid cachexia (Adeuoide Kachexie). Such children are not only in poor health, but their lives can also be endangered.</p>
<p>The treatment of this disease, like tonsil hypertrophy discussed in the previous issue, is ineffective with medication. The only method is surgery. This surgery is completely safe and can be completed in ten minutes. I hope that children in the families of the readers of this newspaper, if they have the conditions mentioned above, such as (1) nasal obstruction, (2) mouth breathing, (3) a dull facial expression and spirit, and (4) tinnitus and hearing loss, should immediately be entrusted to a specialist doctor for detailed examination to find a solution.</p>
<p>▲Reply to Mr. Zhang Cheng</p>
<p>Thank you for your letter inquiring about your symptoms, which seem to be divided into two points: First, you should consult an internal medicine expert for a detailed examination of your digestive system to determine if there is any disease. Second, it seems to be related to the tonsils. If it is indeed a tonsil problem, of course, surgical removal can be performed. According to this type of surgery, recovery can be expected in one week. Adults and married people are not adversely affected by the surgery, but a detailed answer cannot be given without an examination.</p>

<h3 id="e229">A Simple Explanation of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (17) <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>This method of staging, although not of great value in pure theory, continues to be refined by subsequent people; the details of this are of course beyond the scope of this simple explanation. In addition, there is a newer staging method, the nature of its theory is completely different from the former; this is Ranke's three-stage theory of this disease.</p>
<p>Ranke's first stage is the initial aggregation, which refers to the combination of the initial lesion and the associated lymph nodes and vascular system. During this period, the patient will have a violent reaction to the tuberculous toxin. This reaction phenomenon is a manifestation of resistance. Therefore, Ranke gave this stage a special term, called the hypersensitivity period. A clear example of this stage is disseminated miliary tuberculosis. The third stage refers to the spread of the blood vessels, which refers to the trachea, intestinal tract, and other excretory organs. At this time, they are all included in it. The reaction phenomenon is gradually reduced in reverse, which is almost the same as the first stage. This three-stage classification is based on the progression of tuberculosis and the reaction phenomenon, and is completely unrelated to the previous method. Although many facts cannot be unified in this way, we cannot deny its considerable value in theory anyway.</p>
<p>The two staging theories mentioned above, although both have three stages, are actually completely different in content. What is commonly spread by word of mouth is completely the first stage, and has nothing to do with Ranke's. Because Ranke's first stage, initial aggregation, is based entirely on the pathological anatomy, and there are no symptoms on the outside, it is fundamentally not qualified to be called a (disease). Most of the second stage is also latent. This situation is completely different from the previous one. Therefore, we may as well boldly say that the pulmonary tuberculosis referred to by ordinary people can almost be said to be included in Ranke's third stage. In other words, the first and second stages of the first method based on the size of the lesion can also be said to be Ranke's third stage. As for the statement that the first stage is curable and the third stage is hopeless, although it is not an absolute truth, it is undoubtedly directly opposed to the first staging theory; it cannot be inserted into Ranke's statement. The truth of these two staging theories with the same name but different reality is very easy to make people dazzled and at a loss, so I also listed them here in detail, not afraid of being trivial.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Clarifying and Enriching Vernacular Chinese <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>While advocating for (dialects) and (romanization of Chinese characters), we must not forget that the hybrid "neither donkey nor horse" vernacular Chinese is currently a widely used tool for conveying thoughts. If we were to immediately kick away this damnable vernacular Chinese, then our articles discussing the mass language would have no way to be written on paper; — no, no, I could write it in (scholarly pronunciation), but I fear that the number of people who (understand it) would be far fewer than those who understand this hybrid vernacular Chinese!</p>
<p>Therefore, at present, the gentlemen who advocate kicking away vernacular Chinese are very brave and thorough, but unfortunately, they are somewhat disarming themselves.</p>
<p>What must be done concurrently with advocating for (dialects) and (romanization of Chinese characters) is to (first make vernacular Chinese into proper language). This has been said before, but in the past two months, the (mass language discussion) (forum) has neglected this aspect of work too much.</p>
<p>A portion of manpower should be allocated to examining why current vernacular Chinese is not proper language; concrete plans should be proposed to improve current vernacular Chinese — that is, to clarify current vernacular Chinese, to enrich current vernacular Chinese, so that it can better bear the special mission of this period.</p>
<p>Speaking of (improvement), we will think of some (clichés) in (vernacular Chinese). For example: "How sorrowful I am!" Is it impossible to read or understand it? Not necessarily; but this sentence is not a vivid (spoken language) to begin with, and with overuse, it can sometimes truly make people feel disgusted. There are quite a few such (clichés) if you look closely. Furthermore, there are some Europeanized sentence structures that make people unable to understand (or difficult to understand). Here's an example: "(Tie Min, who tightened the belt in front of his stomach, panted, and glanced back halfway around with joyful eyes.)" Another sentence: "(Guo Xiong's face, which had been gloomy for two days, now suddenly showed a layer of happy smiles, slightly opened his mouth, the sun tanned brown, and then thickly smeared with a layer of gray soil and smelly sweat.)" We support adopting European sentence structures, but the examples above are simply possessed by demons. This is vernacular Chinese that is not proper language. Finally, there should also be a limit to the use of classical Chinese words in vernacular Chinese.</p>
<p>Therefore, to (improve) current vernacular Chinese, the first thing to do is to (clarify) it. We must eliminate (clichés), avoid unnecessary Europeanized sentence structures, and classical Chinese words. To do this work, it is not enough to simply put forward principles; we must give examples for everyone to see: which are (clichés), which are unnecessary Europeanized and classical Chinese words. Naturally, the examples will not be exhaustive, but since a strong atmosphere of (clarifying vernacular Chinese) has been created, young people will naturally be cautious and avoid them when writing.</p>
<p>The second is to find ways to (enrich) current vernacular Chinese. Nine out of ten people who write vernacular Chinese feel that there are not enough words to use — especially descriptive words and auxiliary words. Because there are not enough, they have to borrow some from classical Chinese. This is not necessarily a bad idea. We believe that some classical Chinese words can be borrowed and used, and doing so can (revive) them and make them (spoken language). Examples right in front of us are: (beautiful), (sorrowful), (shaking), (wandering), (pursuing), (melancholy)... and words like (compromise), (determined), (strategy), (struggle) have simply become common idioms for the masses. However, relying solely on borrowing is not enough. We also have to adopt (dialects). For example, Cantonese (ding gwaat gwaat), Shanghainese (xiang sha you jie shi), and Northern Chinese (ya genr). In the past, some literary works adopted some (dialects), but the purpose of adoption was mostly to emphasize the (local color) of that work. Now our purpose is to use (dialects) to replace those classical Chinese words that have to be borrowed. For example, the Shanghainese word (kai you), which contains the meanings of (embezzlement and corruption), (sharing the spoils), and (benefiting), is already commonly used in writing and is much more expressive than those classical Chinese words. We will try our best to adopt such dialects, and we will also adopt some special dialects, such as the Shanghainese word (qi ma ren). The meaning contained in this word is not only impossible to find an equivalent word in classical Chinese, but probably not even in other dialects.</p>
<p>I believe that if we earnestly work on these two fronts of (clarification) and (enrichment), then the vernacular Chinese that we currently kick away but cannot do without can become more accessible to the masses. And it can evolve into the unified mass language of the future. Because the (vernacular Chinese) we are currently using is based on Northern Chinese, and the usage range of Northern Chinese accounts for seven-tenths of the country's area, the natural trend in the future will probably be to create a relatively (unified) situation of (Mandarin) with a southern accent and a northern accent — although some people do not recognize (Mandarin) as the mass language now.</p>
<h3 id="e231">The Calamity of Youth <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Baige</p>
<p>Just by flipping through the dark newspapers, you can see some news about youth suicides almost every day. Cherishing life and fearing death is human nature; this is a well-worn saying, and it is also the psychological basis for law enforcement officials using the death penalty as the final judgment for ordinary criminals. Why are so many youths, who are particularly full of vitality, so interested in death? Of course, we cannot bear to say, as those moralistic gentlemen who specialize in blaming the youth say, that it is entirely due to the youth's lack of awareness.</p>
<p>In fact, this has nothing to do with the youth's awareness or lack of awareness. For example, based on the news published in various newspapers, the main reasons are mostly no more than two: one is economic panic, and the other is heartbreak. However, recently there has been a new trick, and there is also the so-called failure in the joint entrance exam. But can we say that these reasons are all caused by the youth's lack of awareness?</p>
<p>If we must say that it is due to the youth's lack of awareness, then we must first ask society to give the youth the path and opportunity to become aware. How should young people become aware? And how can they become aware? These questions should be resolved immediately. However, current society does not give the youth any path or opportunity to become aware at all, and instead tries every means to block and isolate them. Awareness is not allowed, and lack of awareness is to be prepared for. Young people who are not aware will naturally have no choice but to walk to their doom; this is called (self-inflicted evil). If they are truly aware? Then they cannot even walk to their doom; this is called (dead end). So the result can only be that they walk to their doom while bearing the charge of not being aware — suicide; this is called (serves you right).</p>
<p>The fact is very clear. Taking the recent trend of suicide due to failure in the joint entrance exam as an example, we believe that many people will definitely think it serves them right. Except for the parents of the suicide victim who feel grief, other parents or teachers may seize this fact as teaching material to say to their children or students: Aren't you going to study hard? Look at the result of so-and-so! However, in reality, the reason is not that the suicide victim did not study hard, but that the suicide victim's hard work had nowhere to be used and that even if they used it, it would be useless, and so on. Many students from different environments, receiving different kinds of education (some are taught skills like carrying loads on their shoulders and hands, preparing for future employment, such as Mr. You Mojun; some are taught ancient prose that follows orders step by step, preparing for future promotion, such as Mr. Wang Maozu), are examined in the same impractical questions, who can guarantee that they will not fail and commit suicide? Thus, others will say "serves you right," because this is due to their lack of awareness! But to be truly aware, one must oppose this kind of joint entrance exam, and the result is probably not something that can be settled by suicide. In short: This is the current calamity of youth.</p>
<p>When there is a calamity, it should be resolved. In the past and present, various places have not used large sums of money to set up altars for prayer to resolve calamities for the people? It is said that youth are the pillars of future society. It is reasonable that we should put forth great effort to resolve calamities for youth. However, it is necessary to talk about youth's awareness or lack of awareness here. The main responsibility lies with the youth themselves. In other words, although the youth's calamities are not due to their lack of awareness, resolving these calamities lies in their awareness. Moreover, we might as well say it this way: as long as young people generally know this, then their calamities can be resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Ignorance <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>Most of the evils in the world are due to ignorance. The sin of a quack doctor lies in his incompetence, and the sin of a military man lies in his love of war. Extending this to the various crimes of warlords and bureaucrats who sell out the country and harm the people, they are all due to ignorance. In ancient times, the distinction between petty people and gentlemen was stricter than it is today, and the misfortunes of petty people were mostly due to their narrow-mindedness and (unfathomable stupidity).</p>
<p>How can there be so many evils of ignorance in society? Mostly it is created by (those in power). The consistent policy of fooling the people for thousands of years is: the people can be made to follow, but not to know. Following that one road, without knowing that they are all heading towards destruction, is fundamentally a mistake of stupidity.</p>
<p>Therefore, people who are adept in human affairs become saints in this society. But these people are also the ones who harm the country, because saving the country requires talent, and so does selling it out. These people mostly have no ideals, no vision, are harshly critical but think themselves wise, and see petty people as gentlemen; as a result, they are still nothing more than foolish.</p>
<p>If you look at the daily newspapers, you will see so many shocking things in every corner of society, whether it is a watermelon knife chopping off a head or a cigarette can throwing out feces. There is no such thing as law, let alone morality. And the most bizarre thing is that the robber who killed a clergyman in Beiping confessed that he wanted to be a hero in society, and thus achieve (worldwide fame) in one fell swoop, and was very satisfied.</p>
<p>Ignorant people also have their own abilities, but they cannot be prevented from doing evil. The likes of (heroic knights), (great knights), and (sword knights) dominate the thoughts of young and old, and then they think of (worldwide fame), with no shame for their stupidity and cruelty. — To build ivory palaces on this kind of sandy soil is just a dream!</p>
<h3 id="e233">Passing Penang Island <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>As soon as I stepped onto the pier of Penang Island, if there were not two or three Indian money changers wearing bucket hats, handing a roll of banknotes to me and saying they wanted to exchange Burmese currency, I would really feel like I had walked into a coastal city in southern China. In Yangon and Calcutta, the first people to surround travelers are dark brown Indian rickshaw pullers, but here they are Chinese people shouting in Cantonese. Sitting in the car, the plaques on the shops on both sides and the cloth banners fluttering in the streets all show the friendly faces of square characters, flowing continuously behind. Having mixed with Burmese and Indians for three years, once I came here, I naturally felt a sense of tenderness and intimacy growing in my heart.</p>
<p>However, what I still regret is that on this island, which is like early summer all year round, I only lived for five or six hours, briefly browsed the streets and bookstores, and then hurriedly took the night train into the Malay Federation that evening. Although I have passed by twice since then, I have not landed, but just stayed on the ship, looking at its style sleeping under the hot sky and blue sea, as if taking a long shot with a camera.</p>
<p>The train station is on the Malay mainland on the other side, but the ticket office is on the island side of the bay. Connecting the transportation lines in the middle are several small ferries with multi-story, bright lights illuminating the hazy bay at night, cheerfully sailing back and forth, which is really pleasing to the eye. Sitting on the pier like a long corridor waiting to buy a ticket, the Chinese atmosphere seems to make people feel even deeper. Western-dressed travelers from Singapore or Kuala Lumpur, holding young companions in cheongsams, always brushed past, carrying Parisian perfume and the sea breeze of the South. There were also men in old short coats, walking over grayly and weakly, looking towards the police station for a while, and then speaking in Cantonese or Hokkien with a daring-like voice, asking for the pity and help of their fellow villagers. Standing up and taking a walk, there was a Chinese sign that said (Beware of Pickpockets) on the wooden pillar, making a face to warn travelers from afar.</p>
<p>Standing on the ship full of bright lights, the streets and piers retreated all at once, and the city sounds that were still noisy at night suddenly subsided. The peaks on the island had long merged with the dark blue sky. Looking at the railing, it was impossible to tell whether it was the sky or the mountains. Even if there were lights vaguely in the peaks, people unconditionally regarded them as bright stars.</p>
<p>When the train of the Malay Federation was crawling like a long snake on the coast decorated with coconut groves, looking back at the small island with its bright lights on the sea, having parted with me so quickly, a faint sense of loss floated in my heart.</p>

<p>Alisa helped him walk inside and settled him in the chair he usually sat in. The fat man also picked up a chair and sat down. When Alisa sat down, his fat body made the chair groan. He heard this clearly, and almost jumped out of his chair, but remembering that he was still drunk, he had to endure it, just humming twice in his throat. Alisa immediately stood up again, pulled a crude and heavy chair from the corner, and sat down.</p>
<p>"How are you, after this new year?"</p>
<p>The old man said to the visitor in a slow tone. He and the man's father (also a butcher) were good friends, so he could speak to him as if he were speaking to his own son.</p>
<p>"Ah, I'm getting by, always missing the old days!"</p>
<p>Alisa sighed, constantly stroking his fat belly with both hands. Just seeing his belly made it easy to know his profession.</p>
<p>"That's right, things are not going well anymore!"</p>
<p>The old man also sighed, as if the whole world was as old as his possessions in their eyes, and still only a short distance away from the day of destruction.</p>
<p>Each had deep feelings and emotions, and each thought in his heart, how can you make this world regain its former glory! Because they knew how impossible this was, they both sighed. He looked at the fat body, thinking that when he was in his prime, Alisa was only the size of a civet cat, crying in his mother's arms; (at this time he remembered again that he was Alisa's godfather.) Now he was as fat as a yellow cow, making it a little unbelievable. But has this world not changed to the point of being unbelievable? Even King Nicholas was killed, killed by those rebels; those rebels still rule the whole of Russia, it's still them to this day, can such a thing be believed?</p>

<h3 id="e235">The Problem of 25% Rent Reduction Amidst Rural Bankruptcy <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaochen</p>
<p>At a time when all fundamental issues of China's domestic and foreign policy remain unresolved, aside from the Northeast problem, I fear everyone feels that the severity of rural bankruptcy surpasses all else. The decline of the countryside is an undeniable fact, and the reasons for its formation are manifold. To revive the countryside, we must understand its structure before prescribing the right medicine, as this is by no means an accidental occurrence! Amidst this complex situation, as the cry of rural bankruptcy resounds, the issue of 25% rent reduction is worthy of attention, as it greatly impacts both tenant farmers and landlords. Recently, Mr. Xiong Fan published an article in the April 25th issue of the Ta Kung Pao Economic Weekly, entitled "The 25% Rent Reduction and Perpetual Tenancy Rights in Zhejiang," which offered a profound introduction and theory regarding the situation of land management in eastern Zhejiang and the reaction after the implementation of the 25% rent reduction. Although eastern and western Zhejiang are separated by only the Qiantang River, the situation in western Zhejiang is quite different from that in eastern Zhejiang. I would now like to discuss the effectiveness of the 25% rent reduction in western Zhejiang, as well as the previous rental conditions and the nature of the land, and to discuss several points raised by Mr. Xiong Fan.</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Two points are generally associated with the land: the right of disposition and the right of use. The object of the tenant-landlord relationship is established from these two points. A tenant is a tenant farmer, that is, a cultivator who enjoys the right of use. A landlord is a landowner, that is, an owner who holds the right of disposition. Although the connection between tenant farmers and landowners is very close, the boundaries are also very clearly defined. Neither party shall interfere with any part or the whole beyond the fixed conditions that each should bear. This is because a piece of land has a dual property right structure. Its name varies slightly from place to place. In western Zhejiang, what the landlord holds is called the "field bottom," and what the tenant farmer owns is called the "field surface." There are also cases where the bottom and surface are held in one person's hand, but this is limited to farmers who use their own property and is very rare, and it can still be separated at any time without any restrictions. The field bottom is evidenced by a land management certificate and a grain tax household registration certificate. According to legal regulations, it can freely use, profit from, and dispose of the property based on the documents. However, in fact, due to the limitation of the field surface, it can only give the land to farmers for use on the condition of obtaining income, and the scope of the right of disposition outside of income is extremely small. At the same time, the field surface owned by the tenant farmer is the price of enjoying the right of use, and traditionally has a certain amount of power that is not controlled by the landlord. However, the power obtained by the tenant farmer due to the field surface cannot express dissent or interfere with the landlord's due right of disposition. The field surface does not have a certificate, but is based on a private sales contract. The tenant farmer therefore enjoys perpetual tenancy rights. Therefore, the price of the field surface is also the price of perpetual tenancy rights. As for the historical origin of the field surface, although it has been a long time, we can clearly understand that this is because the landlord was afraid that the tenant farmer would default on the rent, and collected a deposit from the tenant farmer in advance, like a key money for renting a house. However, the landlord never returned this deposit, and the tenant farmer believed that to cultivate land owned by others, he should of course pay a considerable price. In this way, the tenant farmer maintained the tenancy right. Later, the population increased continuously, unlike the fixed amount of land, forming an imbalance of more people than land. Everyone had to compete, and the deposit was initially extremely weak, so it rose sharply and reached its peak. This is the result of the imbalance between population and land. The field surface has also become a special organization. The tenancy right changed from temporary to permanent, which can be inherited or freely bought and sold. The power cultivated in the intangible has exceeded the right of use of the nature of lease. Although landlords and tenant farmers have a land chain relationship, they have become a balanced opposition because of the barriers of the field bottom and field surface. Therefore, sometimes ownership changes, but the perpetual tenancy right does not change; or the perpetual tenancy right changes, but the ownership does not change. The landlord's right of disposition is indeed narrow. Landlords who purchase land, unless they also purchase the field surface—perpetual tenancy right—from the tenant farmer, absolutely cannot cultivate it themselves. They only have the right to collect rent from the tenant farmer every year. The tenant farmer can arbitrarily change the form of the cultivated land, such as changing paddy fields to dry land, changing cultivated land to house foundations, or dividing the entire field into two because of brothers dividing the property. As long as the rent is not in arrears, it is not restricted by the landlord. When the landlord transfers property rights, the tenant farmer does not have the right of first refusal, nor is there any possibility of interference. The tenant farmer also has no advisory power in buying and selling the field surface. If there are arrears of old rent, it can be continued to be recovered from the new tenant, which is a slightly different point. The bottom and surface parts of the land each have independent spirit, creating a dual property right. Therefore, the two questions raised by Mr. Xiong Fan: 1. (When property rights are transferred, why must the new landlord allow the old tenant to continue cultivating?) 2. (Why is the tenant right allowed to be freely transferred by the tenant?) are each exercising their inherent rights under dual property rights. After reading the above, it can be clearly understood. Mr. Xiong Fan said: (In the past, the water tenancy right was a personal right, a relative right, and may not have been a property right, but a kind of creditor's right. The landlord is the debtor, and the tenant is the creditor.) This is also seemingly right and seemingly wrong. The reason why the tenant farmer obtained perpetual tenancy rights is that, in addition to the right of use, there are other field surface regulations according to custom. The origin of the field surface has been said above, it is to pay a deposit to the landlord in advance, which is the price for cultivating land owned by others. Therefore, although the landlord has been changed many times, this deposit has never been returned, it has been invisibly eliminated, and the landlord is not responsible for repaying the tenant farmer. Therefore, a separate name called field surface is independently established, and the ownership of the land is completely shared by both the tenant and the landlord. Neither party is a creditor, nor is it a debtor, but the perpetual tenancy right is indeed a property right. The reason why the price of the field surface continues to rise is because the population has increased sharply, which is also raising the tenant farmer's industry, not the landlord's additional collection of deposits. The benefit obtained from the rise in the price of the field surface belongs entirely to the tenant farmer. If one day there are few people and much land, and there is no one to cultivate the land, then the two words field surface will not only be shaken, but will also be fundamentally untenable.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The landlord gives all the land to others for use on the condition of obtaining income. Tenant farmers who cultivate land owned by others are obligated to pay rent. The rent payment system varies from place to place, and has never been determined by the government. Each landlord is free to consider and determine it himself, depending on his personal circumstances and referring to the circumstances of the public. Therefore, not only are they different in each place, but even in the same place, the rent prices set by each landlord are very different and not uniform. The size of the rent price has a great impact on the farmer's economy. The tenant farmer who is obligated to pay rent has no right to question or protest the rent price set by the landlord. Some even exceed the minimum family income by more than double, which is beyond the economic capacity of the tenant farmer, and there is no possibility of appeal. Although this is a minority of the minority, these helpless tenant farmers endure great exploitation, and their plight is worthy of infinite sympathy and indignation! But then again, in western Zhejiang, in the counties of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, there are the most large landlords. More than 70% of the land in each county is in the hands of large landlords, and the largest landlords own more than 10,000 mu of land. Less than 30% of the land is in the hands of small landlords, the least of whom own only dozens or hundreds of mu. Their difference is very far, but families with land, under traditional thinking, are mostly not engaged in production. The family's living expenses rely on the income from land rent. The difference in income between large and small landlords cannot be compared, of course, but the purpose of using this to nourish the whole family is the same. The number of annual expenditures cannot be equal to the amount of land production, so the rent price must be high or low, and cannot stand on a horizontal line. Sometimes the difference is very far, and the reason is here. If you want to standardize the rent price, it is also a very difficult thing. First, the land price is different in each county, and even in one county, there is a lot of rise and fall. The size of the cost and the rise and fall of income are directly proportional. Second, the planting situation of farmers varies from county to county. Taking the autumn harvest as the example of the genuine product, rice planting is of course the most common, but there are also ginger or cotton planting. The nature of rice, ginger, and cotton is completely different, and the harvest is different. Since the rent price is based on the land price and the harvest, with the two reasons mentioned above, it is not easy to unify each county or to set a standard rent price. It is probably no accident that the official authorities have never participated? The land has a bottom and a surface, as if the landlord and tenant farmer are similar to a common form. The tenant farmer pays rent to return a part of the deserved profit from the field bottom. The landlord has the right to collect rent and is also responsible for paying grain and taxes. If the tenant farmer is in arrears with rent, according to the regulations in Pinghu and other places, the landlord can push out the grain and taxes that the household should pay, and the finance bureau will directly collect it from the tenant farmer. There is no such method in the west of Jiaxing. Even if the tenant farmer is in arrears with rent, the grain and taxes that should be paid are still borne by the landlord. In some places, rent is paid in cash, and in some places, it is paid in grain. In Jiaxing, Haiyan, and other places, the landlord sends people to the countryside to collect separately. In Pinghu, Jiashan, and other places, the tenant farmer comes to the landlord's house to return it himself. The rent payment period is limited to the Frost's Descent solar term in some counties, and to the Winter Solstice solar term in some counties, depending on the early or late production of each county. The above are the different places. However, if the rent is still not paid by the rent payment deadline, the rent price will be higher than before the deadline to distinguish it and show fairness, which is uniform in each county.</p>

<p>Since 1929, Zhejiang has implemented a 25% rent reduction, the purpose of which is to remedy the previous lack of standards in the rent collection system, so that the burden on both tenant farmers and landlords has appropriate regulations, especially to protect the development of the farmers' economy and improve the farmers' production capacity. Therefore, this policy is considered the only benevolent policy among the various new policies in Zhejiang Province. However, when it was implemented, it happened that the rural decline changed from slow to acute, and the farmers' livelihoods were struggling under constant danger, collapse, and bankruptcy all reached their climax. On the one hand, the landlord's position was also like being in a storm because of the agitation of rural decline. The environment at this time was deeply surrounded by a very bad atmosphere. The 25% rent reduction expanded under this situation, of course, without good results. In addition, the situation of the fields in each county in Zhejiang Province is different. If we do not adapt to the circumstances and lightly put things of different natures on one road, how can we avoid the disadvantage of uneven suffering? According to Mr. Xiong Fan in eastern Zhejiang, there are five points, which I have now excerpted below:</p>
<p>(A) The land price has plummeted. Land that used to be worth 100 yuan per mu is now only worth 60 to 70 yuan. It is difficult for us to criticize whether this is a good situation or a bad situation. Because from a good perspective, it is the success of the 25% rent reduction, the drop in land prices can increase the opportunity for farmers to buy land. As far as I know, the new landlords in recent years are indeed mostly farmers. But from a bad perspective, the value of industrial property in the whole society has decreased a lot, which has an impact on the social economy. In the past, with the income from 20 to 30 mu of land, a family of several people could live a hard life, but now it is not possible.</p>
<p>(B) People's psychology towards industrial property has changed greatly. In the past, when people had savings, they always wanted to buy land and property, thinking that land property was the business of their descendants for generations. Since the implementation of the 25% rent reduction, people with industrial property have wanted to sell all their existing land property, only worried that no one would care. Because the more land property, the more trouble, if the tenant farmer does not pay rent, you must file a lawsuit. Then, isn't it just for a few tens of yuan of income, and then lose tens or hundreds of yuan in litigation fees, it is really miserable. What's more, these lawsuits are mostly lost by the landlord (especially in the era of the Tenant-Landlord Affairs Bureau, it was very difficult for landlords to win lawsuits against tenant farmers). It is better to take the risk and deposit gold and silver in banks and money houses to earn interest than to buy land and property.</p>
<p>(C) In the past, the landlords and tenants mostly lived in peace. But now, the situation is different, the feelings between the two sides are very bad, and they file lawsuits at every turn. It is said that there is a rich man in the countryside who has 13 lawsuits at the same time, and the summonses he receives are overwhelming. If you don't file a lawsuit, the landlord has to be troubled. There is a landlord who did not properly negotiate the rent payment conditions with the tenant farmer, and the field was about to be abandoned. The tenant farmer actually divided the field into two, thinking that the landlord and the tenant each had half, and only planted his own half.</p>
<p>(D) Since the 25% rent reduction, the landlord's income has been greatly reduced, but the taxes he bears to the government have not only not been reduced, but have increased year by year. In theory, since the government implemented a 25% rent reduction, it should implement a 25% tax reduction for the people to be fair. In recent years, the government has not only not implemented a 25% tax reduction, but has implemented a 25% or more tax increase. It is said that in counties with heavier grain taxes, in years when rice prices have fallen sharply, the landlord's income is only enough to pay the grain.</p>
<p>(E) However, the 25% rent reduction is of great benefit to perpetual tenancy rights. The value of perpetual tenancy rights has risen greatly than before. The ownership of one mu of land is generally 100 yuan, which has fallen to 60 to 70 yuan per mu, and the perpetual tenancy right of this kind of land has risen from 30 yuan to about 50 yuan per mu. In some places, the value of the perpetual tenancy right is simply equal to the ownership. Therefore, in recent years, the general public, even farmers, has little interest in buying land and property, and everywhere they only hear that there is land but no one buys it. The transfer of perpetual tenancy rights is very different. As long as farmers have a little savings, they will buy perpetual tenancy rights. I have asked many farmers, why is perpetual tenancy right better than ownership? They said that the benefits of perpetual tenancy rights are: first, there is no money and food, because the land tax is borne by the landlord. Second, there will be no dispatch of taxes. For example, if the provincial government dispatches highway public bonds to various counties, the county government always dispatches them to landlords with more land property, and will not dispatch them to tenant farmers. According to my investigation, the biggest reason for the rise in the price of perpetual tenancy rights is due to the implementation of the 25% rent reduction. Because according to the 25% rent reduction method, the 25% of the harvest that is reduced belongs to the tenant farmer. In the countryside, it seems that farmers who own 20 mu of perpetual tenancy rights are wealthier than self-cultivating farmers who own 20 mu of ownership. The latter's income is more than the former, but his burden is heavier than the former. Often, farmers who own 20 mu of perpetual tenancy rights temporarily let some of the land with perpetual tenancy rights be cultivated by others. These people are cultivators, some are foreign guests, and some are local poor farmers. In Zhejiang, where there are many people and little land, many people are willing to cultivate as long as there is land to cultivate, regardless of how long it will take. The tenant farmer knows this situation, and uses the auction method to recruit cultivators. Whichever cultivator is willing to offer the highest rent, he can get the right to cultivate. Therefore, this year's cultivator is Zhang San, next year it will be Li Si, and the year after it will become Wang Wu. These cultivators cannot enjoy the benefits of the 25% rent reduction. What they pay every year is the highest rent. On the one hand, after the tenant farmer receives the rent from the cultivator, he will deduct 25% of the harvest and keep it for himself, and then divide the remaining 75% of the harvest equally with the landlord according to the prescribed rent. The landlord collects rent from the tenant farmer as usual, and does not collect rent from the cultivator. Therefore, the tenant farmer can deduct 25% of the harvest. But I still don't understand, what reason does the tenant farmer have to enjoy unearned income, and does the government know about this malpractice?</p>
<p>Looking at the above five points, it is clear that the prices in eastern Zhejiang have fallen drastically, and people's psychology towards industrial property has changed greatly, which has greatly affected the social economy. As a result of the farmers' intentional rent resistance, the price of perpetual tenancy rights has suddenly risen. The landlord's position is in a situation where income is greatly reduced and taxes are increased, and they must groan and gasp. The 25% rent reduction is simply a talisman for tenant farmers, used on one hand to resist landlords, and on the other hand to oppress cultivators. The cultivator is bound by the perpetual tenancy right, and is horizontally exploited by the tenant farmer. Isn't the 25% rent reduction turning into a trend of helping the wicked? As for Mr. Xiong Fan's saying (What reason does the tenant farmer have to enjoy unearned income?), this is the price of the perpetual tenancy right, standing in the same position as the landlord, and there is no reason or basis. However, there is no such situation in western Zhejiang. It is even rarer for tenant farmers to recruit people to cultivate land, and it is not as simple as in eastern Zhejiang. Therefore, the result after the implementation of the 25% rent reduction is very different.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Landlords in western Zhejiang are divided into two classes, large and small. The large ones are extremely large, and the small ones are extremely small. Small landlords do not use legitimate methods to remedy the shortage of income and large expenses, and unreasonably raising rent prices to exploit tenant farmers is really unreasonable. With the arrival of the 25% rent reduction, these small landlords who slashed and hacked indiscriminately, regardless of the livelihood of the farmers, really did not dare to openly use high-pressure methods to act arbitrarily. However, less than 30% of the land in western Zhejiang is in the hands of small landlords, and more than 70% of the land is in the hands of small large landlords. First, large landlords own a lot of land, and their annual income is of course very considerable, which is very wealthy to cope with the living expenses of the whole family. There is no need to raise the rent price. First, there has never been a standard for rent prices, which can be determined by each person. Large landlords in western Zhejiang generally have a considerable reputation in the local area. Short rent prices have always been regarded as a very glorious thing in the eyes of people in western Zhejiang. Therefore, they can all sacrifice themselves to maintain their reputation at the expense of reducing their income. Therefore, the rent price has always been very short, far from the regulations of the 25% rent reduction. It is not known that the degree of rural decline in recent years is getting deeper year by year, and the landlord's fixed income has been discounted year by year. However, the taxes borne have become heavier year by year, and surtaxes have exceeded the regular tax, such as construction special tax, construction surtax, pest control fee, district fee, collection fee, water conservancy fee, primary school fee, skill training institute fee, farmers' bank shares, security team fee, education mu tax, etc., which are innumerable. On the one hand, the government dispatched public bonds to various counties, such as 25, compilation legacy, etc. treasury bonds, highway, clearing, etc. public bonds, and any local shortage, are dispatched to landlords according to the amount of land property. The lives of the major landlords were very wealthy before. They could not withstand these blows. The successive storms have gradually reached the point where income cannot make ends meet, and the mountains and rivers are exhausted. They certainly resented the current political malfeasance, but for the sake of face, especially the good reputation that they have always maintained with one heart and one mind for decades under traditional concepts, they did not have the courage to increase the rent price and dared to destroy the past good reputation. They were willing to struggle and fight hard in the bitter wind and rain. Who knows that at this time, Zhejiang Province promulgated the 25% rent reduction. According to the 25% rent reduction method, the previous rent payment deadline and rent collection procedures must be changed. In this way, the landlord's position became more unstable, not only related to the delay in rent collection, but also affected the number of rent receipts. The method of urging and demanding rent from tenant farmers in arrears became more difficult and ineffective. For the sake of their own interests and the livelihood of the whole family, the major landlords had to make strong statements. Therefore, like a tidal wave, they raised the rent price by agreement and took the regulations of the 25% rent reduction method as the standard, publicly showing compliance with the law. In reality, it was a reaction under resentment. This is the reality of the past few years. However, the 25% rent reduction is a benevolent policy recognized by everyone, and the implementation is untimely and very unsatisfactory. The result obtained in western Zhejiang is this:</p>
<p>A. 30% of the poor tenant farmers have always been oppressed by small landlords, and now they are benefiting from the 25% rent reduction and reducing their burden. However, 70% of the strong tenant farmers have always paid very small rent prices, and now, due to the 25% rent reduction, the major landlords have raised the rent prices, and the increase in expenditure has increased for no reason. Only 30% of the beneficiaries are burdened by 70% of the losers. Isn't it less profit and more examination? No wonder most farmers are complaining. B. The rent price increased, just at the time of rural decline. The farmers' ability is very weak, and the rent business has fallen sharply. The land price has plummeted, from 50 yuan per mu to about 20 yuan, which has reduced the industrial property of the whole society a lot, and the entire social economy has been greatly affected. At the same time, people with cash are not interested in investing in land, which makes the rural economy more and more exhausted. In recent years, internal cash has been concentrated in cities, causing rural collapse and increasing speed. This is also a major reason. C. The tenant farmers suspect that farming is probably not the way out for farmers, because the price of grain and silk has been cheap for years, but the rent price has been increased. Therefore, the price of the field surface has fallen sharply with the price of the field bottom. The value of the field surface was originally very expensive, and in some places it even exceeded the field bottom, but now it has fallen to 20 yuan per mu, and no one wants to buy it. This is exactly the opposite of the situation in eastern Zhejiang. Landlords raising rent prices is similar to drinking poison to quench thirst, resulting in the number of receipts being worse than before every year. Half of the reason is the rural decline? However, due to the low price of land, their own industrial property has been reduced invisibly, but the taxes are still increasing, and the income and expenditure are more uneven. The land cannot be sold, and no one dares to take the land property as a mortgage even if they borrow money. It is becoming more and more difficult to support the whole family's food and clothing. Therefore, the 25% rent reduction needs to be improved separately according to the different situations in different places. Finally, I will also discuss the points that Mr. Xiong Fan mentioned that should be paid attention to:</p>
<p>(1) Reducing taxes is indeed a matter of urgency (now there is only 35% of the rent, in theory, the land tax should also be reduced), and the land tax per mu of land in western Zhejiang is almost 1.5 yuan, accounting for more than one-third of the income. Isn't it too heavy (we feel the same way that we should fight for food for the tenant farmers, and at the same time, we should leave some food for the landlords to eat)! This is really true!</p>
<p>(2) (In the current situation, the obligations of perpetual tenancy right holders to the government are less; at the same time, from a legal and economic point of view, between existence and non-existence, we can find ways to reduce perpetual tenancy rights. Because with perpetual tenancy rights, it is inevitable to restrict ownership.) This can be tried in eastern Zhejiang because the nature of the land is different. In western Zhejiang, it must not be promoted, because this will make the tenant farmer's position more isolated and more insecure. On the landlord's side, because he cannot cultivate the land himself, there is no benefit to speak of. On the contrary, because the price of perpetual tenancy rights has fallen as a result, the tenant farmer has lost his faith.</p>
<p>(3) (This year, Zhejiang has newly established) a perpetual tenancy right deed tax, which can increase the burden of perpetual tenancy rights. However, this tax is only collected once when the right is transferred, and is not collected every year. I think we can create a kind of tenancy tax, and add the tax reduced from the landlord's side to the tenant farmer's side. This can also be done in eastern Zhejiang, but it is impossible in western Zhejiang. Because the tenant farmers who hold perpetual tenancy rights in western Zhejiang are the cultivators, and they are not unearned. The ability to pay rent is already full of holes, how can they be able to bear the tax?</p>
<p>However, we are currently in the midst of the sound of rural bankruptcy, and we are concentrating our efforts to save the rural crisis, especially to stabilize the lives of farmers. This is by no means a great task that can be borne by the 25% rent reduction alone. In such an extraordinary period, it is not easy to change any system. Therefore, the result of the 25% rent reduction is greatly contrary to the ideal. The 25% rent reduction system certainly needs to be improved, and the most important thing is that there is no plan to remedy the entire countryside. Now, to implement the 25% rent reduction, we must first predetermine the steps to revive the countryside, and work together, then there can be effective results.</p>
<p>Editor's note: The situation described by Mr. Wu fails to summarize western Zhejiang and also seems to be too biased towards speaking for large landlords. However, after the implementation of the 25% rent reduction, there are indeed various things that are enough to cause the system itself to shake. Therefore, this article is disclosed to assist in research.</p>

<p>In 1933, the total global production of rayon reached 659,500,000 pounds, with the United States ranking first, accounting for 207,580,000 pounds. What is most astonishing is that Japan leaped to second place with as much as 99,500,000 pounds. The traditionally renowned rayon-producing countries of Britain and Italy had to settle for third and fourth place, respectively. In terms of percentage, the US produced 32 percent, Japan 15 percent, Britain 13 percent, and Italy 12 percent. The following is a statistical table of rayon production in various countries for the past three years (in thousands of pounds):</p>
<p>1931　　　　1932　　　　1933</p>
<p>United States　　　150,880　　　134,815　　　207,580</p>

<p>Total　　　　499,340　　　530,220　　　659,500</p>
<p>Although rayon has been invented for many years, it was not valued before. Since 1918, it has gradually improved, with significant results, and various countries have begun mass production. The following is a list of annual production statistics for the past sixteen years (in pounds):</p>
<p>1918　25,900,000　　　1926　214,840,000</p>

<p>Recalling twelve years ago, when Americans came to the East to investigate the silk industry, their purpose was none other than to understand how raw silk is manufactured and what methods could be used to obtain cheap raw silk for American use. This is because the United States is the largest consumer of raw silk in the world. If something were to happen with neighboring countries, the supply would be immediately cut off, which would be very dangerous. Therefore, they had to spend huge amounts of money to research artificial silk production, which would not only maintain the domestic economy but also make the value of raw silk increasingly cheaper. If you don't believe me, just look at the recent decline in raw silk consumption in the United States year by year, which is clear evidence. Therefore, the increase in rayon production in the United States has led to a decline in the demand for raw silk. Conversely, raw silk prices are more than double that of rayon, and raw silk transactions immediately lack vitality. The Japanese are well aware of this situation, so they have shifted their focus from studying raw silk to studying rayon and rayon blends with other materials, and are engaged in manufacturing. Initially, the products were of poor quality and were only used for domestic trials. Since adopting European and American methods and making major improvements, they have been planning to establish factories since the sixth year of the Showa era (1931), sparing no effort. Now, according to a survey at the end of April this year, the names of rayon factories in that country that have already started production and are scheduled to start production are listed in detail below for the reference of our countrymen:</p>

<p>Considering that Japan has already obtained the throne of raw silk production and is now engaged in the large-scale design of rayon, it is because insightful people in that country have realized that raw silk has no possibility of further progress, no hope of price increases, and it is difficult to make a profit. If the United States, the largest customer of raw silk, does not need supplies, their rural areas could immediately go bankrupt. For the sake of future life, the production of large quantities of rayon and rayon textiles or other interwoven products, sold cheaply, is not enough to compensate for the aforementioned losses. Therefore, most of their newly built factories are equipped with the latest equipment, and all can start manufacturing this autumn, and their development is immeasurable when combined with textiles. Therefore, Japan will become the world's leader in rayon production, and even the United States will be left in the dust. It is noted that Japan's rayon raw materials were mostly purchased from the United States. Since 1918, various places in Northeast China have become places where they can freely take and demand raw materials. No wonder they are aggressively proceeding to compete for the world market.</p>
<p>It is noted that the use of rayon in our country's fabrics was originally intended to make the colors clear and eye-catching in order to compete with imported silk. Therefore, it was not used much. Later, in order to cater to social psychology and with the goal of being cheap and beautiful, cotton yarn was interwoven with rayon, or fabrics made purely of rayon were supplied to the market, and sales increased greatly. As a result, many people started weaving, and our country's rayon imports increased day by day. The rayon from countries such as Britain, Italy, Germany, and France was sold in large quantities in our country five years ago. Since Japan implemented dumping, Japanese goods have occupied more than 70 percent of our rayon market, and European goods have found it difficult to compete. It is feared that in a few years, Japan will monopolize our market.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country's overseas raw silk market, it has been occupied by Japan, and the export volume has been decreasing day by day. On the contrary, rayon imports are flowing in continuously. What compatriot is willing to harm themselves and offer so much money to foreigners? This spring, various newspapers mentioned the idea of our country running its own rayon factories, but there has been no movement to this day. Could this be another manifestation of the bad habit of saying without doing? I hope that the industrial community can teach them a lesson.</p>
<p>(Note) The author originally wanted to include statistics on our country's rayon imports in the report, but there were too many smuggled goods on the market, making it difficult to obtain accurate figures, so they were not published.</p>

<h3 id="e238">Bond Market Heavily Hit by Rumors Last Week <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Last week, from August 13th to 18th, the market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange went from hovering to weakening, and then from weakening to falling, with the falls becoming increasingly severe, causing an unintentional, huge wave of decline. As for the reasons, the tense situation between Japan and Russia was generally known to be far from a break. The rampant bandits in Fujian were generally known to be clowns jumping around. The issuance of new government bonds worth 100 million yuan was still undecided. Whether there were problems with the Fifth Plenary Session was a phenomenon that occurred every time. Most of these were just sensational rumors. The above-mentioned reasons are all superficial and not the real cause of the decline. However, the various unfounded rumors that were triggered by these reasons were enough to shake the hearts of the weak, and the outflow of cash, which had already reached 70 to 80 million yuan, had undoubtedly greatly reduced the purchasing power of Shanghai's reserves. Furthermore, it was faintly heard that most of the various groups intended to suppress small market conditions, and their other intentions were conceivable. Therefore, there would be many reversals in the future, and the ups and downs might not follow the usual rules. The events of last week: On Monday, the Northern Group stopped selling, and market prices were mixed, showing signs of recovery. On Tuesday, the Northern Group slightly replenished their positions, recovering by 30 to 40 jiao, but the trend showed no strength. On Wednesday, due to the most active selling on the 16th, prices fell by 20 to 60 jiao. On Thursday, there were more rumors, the situation between Japan and Russia was tense, and there were also rumors in Fuzhou, causing prices to fall by more than 1 yuan. On Friday, prices suddenly recovered by about 50 fen, which was already unusual. Whether there were other intentions was unknown. On Saturday, the environmental news remained the same, but market prices fell the most. The 22nd Customs Bond fell sharply by 1 yuan and 30 fen. According to the silk market results, the declines ranged from several jiao to 2 yuan and 20 fen. As for the total number of transactions, the results of the gains and losses are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).

<p>Xinhua Foreign Firm reported yesterday (18th) that the quietness of the New York stock market was rare in the past decade. The bond market lacked commercial news, and most of the firms were absent. Due to the scarcity of transactions, major bonds showed slight weakness, but most remained unchanged. The commodities market was also extremely sluggish, with only 160,000 shares traded in half a day. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to a lack of major buyers, southern hedge selling, and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, spot prices fell by 15 points and futures prices fell by 13 to 16 points. British cotton futures rose by 3 to 4 points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to profit-taking by bulls and selling by brokers, but later strengthened due to short covering. As a result, Pingguoer and Bailuoxi fell by 2.5 jiao, and Aomula remained unchanged.

<h3 id="e244">Father and Son <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Ji</p>
<p>——After reading Mr. Shishi’s (On Fathers and Sons)——</p>
<p>In 1862, the Russian Turgenev wrote a great novel, "Fathers and Sons." That novel depicted the conflict between the old and new ideas of the 1880s. Isn't this kind of ideological conflict prevalent not only in the Soviet Union of 1934 but also in almost every country in the world?</p>
<p>According to Inoue Chiki's opinion quoted by Mr. Shishi, the conflict between fathers and sons is said to be mainly due to the (sexual) dissatisfaction of young people. If a young man has a wife and children, he will immediately become a steady and mature person, and all the estrangement between father and son can be eliminated invisibly through early marriage. Regardless of whether Inoue Chiki (has profound academic basis) for this argument, it must be said that his understanding of the conflict between fathers and sons is superficial. If our understanding can penetrate into the core of things, we would find Inoue Chiki's argument laughable.</p>
<p>All words and deeds of human beings are determined by the social relations of production and the forces of production. If a conflict between the relations of production and the forces of production occurs, undoubtedly, all words and deeds of human beings will also show different manifestations due to that conflict. The conflict between fathers and sons is just a small conflict within this large conflict among human beings!</p>
<p>Mr. Shishi believes that Inoue Chiki's argument that (early marriage of young people can maintain harmony between fathers and sons) relies too much on the father's side. Therefore, in order to consider both sides without bias, he feels that there is no better solution than (compromise) between the two sides. But who should compromise with whom? Should the father compromise with the son, or should the son compromise with the father? Mr. Shishi mysteriously (hopes that smart readers can give him a fair judgment), but his own conclusion is tentatively postponed.</p>
<p>Although I am not talented, I would like to provide an answer under this topic.</p>
<p>I say: fathers can compromise with sons, and sons can compromise with fathers. How do I explain this? Because human words and deeds are determined by the relations of production, it can be said that existence determines people's consciousness. If the father and son have the same view on the understanding of reality, and the son agrees with the father's point of view, then the son compromises with the father; conversely, if the father agrees with the son's point of view, then the father compromises with the son. To give an analogy: if the father insists on (relying on parents' orders and matchmakers' words) for marriage issues, while the son denies that feudal concept and advocates (free union) to resist it, this is a manifestation of the conflict between fathers and sons in general. But some (sons) who have been deeply baptized by old ideas agree with that kind of (parents' orders, matchmakers' words) marriage, then it is the (son)'s compromise with the (father); conversely, many (fathers) are influenced by the trends of this great era and express absolute approval for the (son)'s (free union) in marriage issues, this is the (father)'s compromise with the (son).</p>
<p>In short: there is no such thing as compromise or no compromise between fathers and sons. The storm of conflict between fathers and sons in the family is an epitome of the storm of a certain era!</p>

<p>— Hong</p>
<p>A few days ago, I visited Mr. X and asked him about the way to write articles. He replied: Your behavior is too straightforward and lacks humor. Moreover, you are used to picking at the sore spots of XX, which is most undesirable. In the future, you should read more humorous articles and express less blunt complaints, and so on. I only read (Analects) periodically, but it doesn't seem to work. It is my nature, and it is not easy to pretend. When I returned, I thought of seeking help from humorous writings. So, I borrowed a collection of poems and essays from a friend's bookshelf, which was compiled by Yang Ruquan, published by Ta Kung Pao, and had more than 300 pages. It was indeed a magnificent work. After browsing and reading carefully, I found every article to be interesting and beautiful beyond description, especially the "Poetry Talks." Now, I specially select and transcribe some of them here to share with fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>One day, Chu Yu of Yixing passed by Deng Ruxiao's house in Jinsha. Deng told him about his state of starvation. So, he improvised a poem to comfort himself: (Having a mouth but no food, no need to worry, having food but no mouth, one should worry. A true man understands the meaning, and can get out of the pit of troubles.) Chu said: In previous years, I was too poor to have pants, so I also improvised a poem: (The west wind blows rain rustlingly, this big leg has nowhere to go, I posted a notice on the street this morning, borrowing pants for those who have them.) The people in the seat were mostly poor scholars, and they laughed together. - Anecdotes of Official Travels -</p>
<p>A new bride urinated in bed at night. Someone mocked her with a poem: (No need for painting to become a dragon, frequently saying "excuse me" in a dream, Zhibo had a head but was useless, Duke Pei did not follow to the toilet. Not about clouds and rain wetting Wushan, like rivers breaking and earth flowing, suddenly awakened by the husband's call beside the pillow, only to realize that she was in the Crystal Palace.)</p>
<p>A hunchback's poem says: (Never arrogant in life, always bowing, able to be flexible with people, smiling at the spring breeze everywhere).</p>
<p>Tang Ziwei's poem on a painting of a half-bodied beauty says: (Her natural posture is graceful and very charming, but unfortunately, her waist is only half-length; I hate the painter for having no insight, and he didn't depict the moving parts. Whose ingenious brush writes about romance, stopping when the romance is written; I think it was where they met, beside the short wall in Xinghua Village).</p>
<p>A widow asked the prefect Yi to approve her remarriage. Prefect Yi asked who she was marrying. The widow replied that she was marrying Chen Ergong, a mounting worker in the east neighborhood. Yi jokingly wrote: (Approve remarriage, approve remarriage, marry Chen Ergong in the east neighborhood, the spring scenery annoys people and makes them unable to sleep, the moonlight moves the shadow of the flowers onto the railing. Marry, marry, marry). - Book of Dew -</p>
<p>A woman was punished by the county magistrate for her husband stealing cattle. She wrote a poem to the county magistrate: (Using a washbasin as a mirror, using washing water as oil, I am not the Weaver Girl, and my husband cannot be the Cowherd). The county magistrate exempted him from the crime after seeing the poem. - Firm Gourd Collection -</p>
<p>A poem mocking thin porridge says: (Thin porridge with sparse water floating, the nose wind blows up waves in autumn; it looks like the scenery of West Lake, only missing a fisherman dropping a fishing hook.) - Random Notes from the Abstinence Hermitage -</p>
<p>Also: (Thin porridge settling at the bottom of the bowl, the nose wind blows up thousands of layers of waves, sometimes a grain floats on the water surface, no one crosses the wild ferry and the boat crosses by itself.)</p>

<p>— Hui Ren</p>
<p>The sea water crashed blackly in the deep night, carrying a somewhat tragic tone; the ferry, flying steadily in the sea, headed from the lights of a city built on sin, deceit, promiscuity, and agitation, towards that dark future, taking with it these people who were perhaps already tired of the greasy life of the city.</p>
<p>However, the radio was still playing fashionable songs from the city, bringing with it the scent of powder, thighs, and charming smiles on this deep night at sea.</p>
<p>(People who can't forget the city, even though you say you are already tired of the greasy life of the city!) I couldn't help but shout softly.</p>
<p>The sea water surged with more waves, and the noise had gradually faded away, but the annoying music seemed to be even louder! It reduced my ability to appreciate the tragedy of the late night at sea, it prevented me from quietly listening to the beat of the waves in the dark night, and it brought me even more sins of the city, I couldn't help but curse secretly.</p>
<p>The sea breeze of the dark night brushed people's hair and blew the people's thin cicada-like cheongsams. People thought that this was a gentle wind bringing them love, so they hugged tightly and shouted softly; (Love, is it comfortable)?</p>
<p>I was surprised and confused. Why did people regard this late night at sea as their mysterious pastime? I could only complain and say: (Surging, waves, blowing, sea breeze, show your grandeur and tragedy, don't let people regard you as a place for mysterious pastime)</p>
<p>A star suddenly flashed like a sword in the sky and fell to the northwest corner. People here regarded it as a rare event, but I believe that this is inevitable, because its historical fate is over!</p>
<p>I stood my whole body on the deck, letting the tragic, great late night at sea envelop me. I am so weak, incompetent, and need grand stimulation to add to my heart.</p>

<p>— Xue Er</p>
<p>I like winter. This is a common habit of every old man. I am not an old man, but I have the same preferences as old men.</p>
<p>Winter has a lovely sun. Old men hold hand warmers, hold their dry tobacco pipes, and talk about the escape when the Taiping rebels came, lengthening their faces as if they still had lingering fear. They talk about how women are no longer like women, pouting their mouths and sighing with emotion; occasionally, they also talk about the awe of passing the imperial examination, closing their old, blurred eyes, stroking the beard under their faces, hoping that time would be pulled back forty or fifty years. I like winter, but not for these reasons. I like winter best when there is a big wind and heavy snow every day. On windy days, I brew a pot of good tea, crack melon seeds by the fire, and listen to the sound of the wind sweeping over the roof, being blocked by the big trees, and finally roaring forward as if the roof was about to be taken away. My heart seems to follow it to the top of high mountains and the edge of the sea. On the top of the high mountains, there are towering old pines, and on the beach, there are raging tides. If you think of a beautiful world, you can also follow it to a land of nowhere. If you have a few friends who can talk well, it will be even more interesting. On windy days, the world in this house is yours; when it snows, you occupy the world outside the house. In the South, you can't play ice skating or sledding. Piling up snow Buddhas is also a fun game; or bring a camera to the nearby countryside. The corner of a thatched cottage next to a tree and the village girl by the stream are all the backgrounds you need. Even if your fingers are frozen, your heart is fiery. Winter is so lovely.</p>
<p>I like autumn even more, but old men don't have this kind of love. It is said that autumn symbolizes aging. When the leaves fall, old men's hearts become uneasy. They feel that death is right in front of them. In fact, old men have reached the age of aging. Aging people should express affection for the aging season. However, all humans are afraid of death. This aging season is loved by me.</p>
<p>Poets also like autumn because poets are all sentimental. Their songs about autumn are all sad tunes, just like old men. This is a human eccentricity. They become active when they see red peach trees and green willows in spring, but they don't know that maple trees in autumn are more beautiful, and willow branches in autumn also have a different kind of gentle taste. As long as you don't have an aging heart, this world is lovely everywhere. Spring is a harlot. She is as alluring as a snake, and people find her lovely; but to appreciate the beauty of a virgin, love this aging autumn! Comparing autumn and a virgin is not necessarily a failure.</p>
<p>That beautiful outline has already been explored in front of everyone's window. Don't miss the opportunity. She is autumn!</p>
<p>I say again, as long as you don't have an aging heart, autumn is the most likable season of the year.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Older Brother <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Cun Yin</p>
<p>The sky is azure blue. A gust of cool wind makes the leaves rustle rhythmically. A mournful moon is slowly rising.</p>
<p>Older brother has come home. His face is ashen, and his lips are white. His expression is too dejected. Before he could sit down, he coughed up a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>Older brother, oppressed by life, this is because you are too overworked.</p>
<p>At home: mother, younger sister, and me, this ignorant younger brother. The three of us depend on you! The three of us bite into your flesh. The three of us suck your blood.</p>
<p>(Older brother, why don't you go to the doctor for a check-up!)</p>
<p>We all know: this is painful for him.</p>
<p>(Child! Don't go to work tomorrow.)</p>
<p>Mother knows that if he doesn't work for a day, we will have to go hungry for a day.</p>
<p>(Mom. It's okay!)</p>
<p>Older brother went to bed without any energy.</p>
<p>(Older brother, shall we get a doctor?)</p>
<p>I thought: doctors are always willing to save the lives of poor people.</p>
<p>After listening to my words, older brother said with a sigh:</p>
<p>(Younger brother! Where do we get the money to see a doctor? Alas.)</p>
<p>Slowly. He supported himself up. He took out six dimes from his blue cloth jacket pocket. He also said:</p>
<p>(Younger brother, go buy some vegetables. Buy some rice! Use the remaining money to pay back ten cents to Aunt Zhang next door first.)</p>
<p>I walked out of this humble thatched cottage, a thatched cottage with the scent of antiques. I never live inside. During the day, I go to the garbage dump to scavenge. In my spare time, I go to the nearby free school to learn a few characters.</p>
<p>Every day, I can earn more than ten coppers. These few coppers can only buy some kerosene, but it is only enough to light up one night.</p>
<p>The stars in the sky are all drilling out one by one!</p>
<p>In my heart, I think: older brother is indeed too hardworking. He often works at night, wanting to earn a few more dollars. But older brother, who was born weak, can't stand working all day and night? I can only hope that his illness will get better soon!</p>
<p>What a coincidence! Across from the rice shop, there is a doctor's sign hanging. When the rice was bought, I broke in and wanted to ask the doctor to see older brother's illness. But the guard at the door punched me in the mouth.</p>
<p>Bearing the anger, I backed out. I'm not angry because I know: the poor are always wrong, even if they're not.</p>
<p>I bought three copper coins worth of tofu and eight copper coins worth of salted fish.</p>
<p>By the way, I went to Aunt Zhang next door.</p>
<p>(Child, you must tell your older brother to pay me back a little more when he has money!…)</p>
<p>Her face always looks like something in the house has been stolen by thieves.</p>
<p>I didn't say much to her and walked out.</p>
<p>Just as I stepped into the door, I could hear older brother's moans!</p>
<p>The light of the kerosene lamp seemed particularly miserable. I didn't dare to sniff deeply, because this...so many blood clots...ah!</p>
<h3 id="e249">Wild Beauty <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Mai</p>
<p>Ten wild beauties moved across the street. After three to five days of searching, I was very satisfied to discover her.</p>
<p>She is beautiful enough, at least one person, me, believes so.</p>
<p>She has the good manners of a cosmopolitan woman, but absolutely none of the hateful habits of the metropolis. Yet she is not a rustic country bumpkin either. She is right in the middle of everything. A light blue cheongsam perfectly expresses her pure beauty.</p>
<p>Her figure is slender, light, but not the frail and sickly type of Daiyu. Her face is round and well-proportioned, covered with long black hair. Her figure rises and falls rhythmically, not a single straight line, but not the so-called curvy beauty with excessive undulations. Plain socks, plain flat shoes. She walks with a hop, skip, and a jump. Whenever I see her, I silently call out (You wild beauty, ah!)</p>
<p>Yes, my vision is not so wrong. Many people who have seen her sincerely subscribe to my critique. Even Xian, who used to despise her so much, saying she was too thin and lacked the quivering of flesh, has recently been particularly diligent in leaning against the window and looking at her, paying close attention to her behavior, her beautiful figure.</p>
<p>Recently, I have also discovered that there are many people attracted to her.</p>
<p>She has to go out and come home every morning and evening. It is definitely not her wild behavior. I think she must be studying at a school in the neighborhood. It is precisely because of her timely coming and going that some people forget their bad intentions. It's a long story.</p>
<p>But living in such a deep alley, it is still separated by so many bends to go to the main street. These bends have become her dangerous gorge. She always hesitates for a while when she goes out. At first, I thought she was just playing around and being coquettish, but who knew she was suffering from an unspeakable fear! I noticed, and sure enough, one day I found the source of this fear. There are always two people standing idly at the turning in front, as if waiting for something. After looking again and again, I realized that this was the origin of her fear. I knew that those waiting loafers must not be good people.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it was true. After a while, Xian told me that she was coming back from outside in the evening and was stopped by two loafers at that turning. It was an ugly, entangled mess. It was not easy for her to escape.</p>
<p>Now, every time she goes out and comes back, she has to call a rickshaw puller to be her protector. Sometimes she has to bring a follower—a child or a huge dog.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, women have no freedom and no protection.</p>
<p>Wild beauty, my loyal heart is really extremely anxious for you, anxious that you will not be able to escape this dangerous disaster! This deep alley is like a dangerous gorge. You are weak. How can you cross it? You will eventually be harmed one day. Why don't you move? I am really worried about you.</p>
<p>Why are women so hated? Why are they so unprotected?</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Before the Shanghai War, my family could be considered a middle-upper-class family, but we were not arrogant or extravagant at all. At that time, based on the orders of my parents and the words of a matchmaker, I became engaged to a man named Chen. I was only eighteen years old at the time. After the engagement, this man named Chen often oppressed me. He did not allow me to talk or interact with other men and women. Later, he even forbade me from making girlfriends. He treated me as his private property, forbade me from increasing my knowledge, and opposed me going to school. Therefore, not only could I not bear it, but my parents and all my relatives also agreed that I should break the engagement. However, I had not reached the legal age and could not make my own decisions freely. After two and a half years, I finally cancelled the engagement with that man named Chen. At this time, I felt that I was free and that my future was very bright and far-reaching. I only hoped to study hard and walk on the road to success. Who knew that half a year after I broke the engagement, a friend introduced me to a boyfriend! After this man met me, he soon expressed his admiration for me and even wanted to force a kiss on me. I felt he was too abrupt, and he became angry and ashamed. Therefore, we could not even maintain our friendship. However, this was no loss to me, so I did not feel anything. After working hard alone for a year, who knew that at the end of last year, I met that boyfriend I had not seen for a year at a social gathering. This reunion was truly unexpected. We actually gradually fell in love, and now we have had physical relations with him. Unexpectedly, my most dignified and precious virginity was lost because of his false love. Now, because of a very small reason, he is using excuses to ignore me, and I have heard that he is going to find a new lover. However, although I have encountered this unfortunate event and inauspicious news, for some reason, I still love him with all my heart and still hope that we will have a day of reconciliation and marriage. However, I know that this is not possible because I really cannot find a way to make him change his mind. Therefore, I both hate him and love him. I am troubled and in pain myself. I have thought about suicide several times, but sometimes I think back to myself. Now that I have sacrificed my purity for him, if I die because of him now, he probably will not pity me. Moreover, I still have my elderly parents at home, and I really cannot bear to make them sad again. Because we have become bankrupt after the Shanghai War. The more I think about it, the more pitiful I feel, and my finances are tight. It is not easy to find a job, and a pure body has suffered this kind of insult, which really makes me feel that life has no meaning at all. I also have no way to avenge my personal anger because I have no evidence to say that he abandoned me. At the same time, I am afraid that others will not understand my unfortunate experience and will instead say that it is because of my romantic nature. Therefore, I can only hate in my heart. When my heart aches like it is breaking, I really want to die. However, before I leave society, please give me a way out and guide me on how I should treat him and how to settle myself. I wish you well, Hu Lujia.</p>
<p>Letter…</p>
<p>Answer: The editor always believes that it is really not an easy thing to be a woman in today's society. The shackles of the old etiquette and the deception of treacherous men are enough to make them suffer or fall. Unless they can be rationalized everywhere, using reason to overcome emotion can reduce some pain and sadness.</p>
<p>Reading your letter, it is truly up and down, sometimes happy and sometimes sad, like reading a social novel. No matter who it is, they deeply sympathize with your experience. However, your failure to be cautious from the beginning to the end and sacrifice your virginity is also a shortcoming. This is committing the shortcoming of failing to overcome emotion with reason as mentioned earlier. At the same time, there is still a contradictory thought in your heart. On the one hand, you have already understood that you have been deceived by his false love. On the other hand, you still love him with all your heart and still hope that he will marry you, but you also know that marriage is not possible. If this contradictory mentality cannot be resolved, then your pain will be difficult to eliminate. You are a courageous woman, because you were able to break the engagement with the man named Chen, so you are not an ordinary person. Then why don't you have the courage to break off with that kind of man who specializes in trampling on women? He has deceived you. Why do you still cling to him? It is necessary to understand that love is carnal desire, and love is inspiration. He only loves you carnally, but has he ever loved you? Because if he loved you, how could he break off with you halfway because of trivial matters? Therefore, the editor believes that you should completely shatter the past shadows, leaving no traces in your heart, no need to hate, and no need to suffer to the point of suicide. Re-identify the goals of life, on the one hand, find a proper job to supplement the family's economy, which can also prevent men from daring to despise you. On the other hand, use a rational eye to find a man who is truly worthy of love. Otherwise, it is better to be single than to repeat the same mistakes. These are the ways out that the editor believes I can point you toward.</p>

<p>— Ji Yu</p>
<p>Thinking of how he fell ill in the spring due to the disappearance of his children and grandchildren, and missed the tobacco planting season, now he's being levied (lazy tax). Thinking of his daughter-in-law's illness, thinking that the bean and wheat seeds were all eaten, the heavens are not sending lightning, the sweet potatoes on the slope are not spreading vines, and the corn is not bearing kernels; thinking of how the rice in the field is about to dry up and become flammable. And from the lack of harvest in the autumn, he thought of his family's hunger and cold, and the landlord's deduction of all the deposit money. All the thoughts, like scattered duckweed, floated up intermittently. The eleven and a half dollars due tomorrow... two dollars penalty for each day late... double the amount after three days... imprisonment (in the dark room)... these terrible things, like bedbugs, nailed into his brain. Should he go to Chief Zhou to borrow money again? But today he borrowed rice and oil from their family; the three dollars to send away the militia, they weren't just lending it to us for nothing. Wasn't it just a few days ago that he said to others: as long as I agree to marry Xiuying to him as a concubine, he would always do his best to help me with money. Alas, money, Xiuying, life... Sigh, I won't borrow money from him, I'm determined not to borrow money from him, for the sake of money, I cannot ruin my own flesh and blood, Xiuying, I... I cannot sell you to a rich man, to be a rich man's concubine... I would rather...</p>
<p>In the dark night, only the calls of frogs and crickets in the distance, sounded mournful, as if lamenting the injustice of this old man.</p>
<p>Old Man Wang, suddenly stood up, quickly paced into the main room, fumbled for a while, and when he came out, he gently closed the door again. He walked straight towards the courtyard gate on the side, suddenly it felt like someone was pulling his waistband from behind, his body leaned back and then lunged forward, with a thud, he fell to the ground. He struggled greatly to turn himself over, looked back at his back, at his house, and sighed mournfully:</p>
<p>- Heaven, I... Wang Laosi, have never been lazy in my life, never stole half an hour, but, my son, my grandson were taken away, I was sick, and I didn't have time to plant tobacco, alas... lazy... lazy tax, didn't plant tobacco, they want to levy my lazy tax, I... I have no money, only this old life... take my old life as the tax... Wife, Xiuying, you... you two, don't worry about me, each of you live peacefully... Alas, Yinsheng, Yuanxing... you, can you still come back alive... Alas, I can't wait for you anymore...</p>
<p>His tears flowed down his cheeks like water from a waterwheel, rolling down to the ground from his cheeks, he had fainted from grief.</p>
<p>The next morning, Old Man Wang stood stiffly under the large cypress tree outside the courtyard gate, Xiuying hugged his legs and tried to drag him away, but couldn't, only then did she discover that his neck had been tied with a circle of palm rope.</p>
