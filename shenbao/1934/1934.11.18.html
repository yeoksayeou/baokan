<h3>南意關係興歐局</h3>
<p>— 恒。</p>
<p>據最近電訊。意大利興南斯拉夫問。又互相交惡。南斯拉夫指意人散發反南傳單。面意大利亦以南斯拉夫公然舉行反意示威運動。而大為不滿。於是兩國自大戰終止以來之仇怨猜嫌。頗有實地爆發之勢。同時南斯拉夫興匈牙利之關係。亦甚惡化。足見馬賽慘案。雖未為二次大戰之引線。而已使巴爾者苦心維持之歐陸均勢感覺絕大之威脅矣。</p>
<p>巴爾都之外交政策。在結合歐陸各國。以孤德國之勢。此固盡人所知者也。計其所做到者。（一）為俄法之攜手。（二）為小恊約之團結。（三）為巴爾幹之內附。他如法意友誼之增進。意南關係之改善。雖亦在巴氏劃策進行中。然以馬賽之一擊。而終至功敗垂成。我人於該案疑生後。會謂今後之法國外交仍將遵循巴氏遺策。唯其手段技巧或將發生變化。果也。馬賽慘案。距今已有月餘。而巴氏未竟之工作。不獨未有絲毫之成功。抑且阻礙業生。雖曰此種現象為該案發生後之國際情勢之反映。而人的問題。亦為一重要之因素。可不待言也。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫為小恊約之重心。亦為巴爾幹公約國之中堅。自法德關係緊張以來。德國屬以商業利益勾引南國。德之政策。若能成功。則一方可以破壞法國興小恊約之結合。加深南斯拉夫興意大利之惡化。同時又可使法意之交好。無由實現。故南斯拉夫實處於舉足輕重之地位。設竟步波蘭之後塵。而趨向於德。則法人不獨將失去。小恊約之聲援。卽巴爾幹公約之效用。亦將不能發揮。反之。若南人對法之關係。愈益密切。則德人將不免有技窮之嘆。其關鍵之重要如此。故其態度之向背。頗為巴爾都所重視也。</p>
<p>唯就近日南意南匈間互相交惡之現象而觀。則三國間之能否捐除宿嫌。殊成問題。旬日前匈總理貢博斯訪奧訪意。其內容雖不得而知。然意在對南。且謀修約主張之伸展。要無可疑若然。則不僅意南南匈之關係。無法改善。卽意奧匈集團興小恊約之關係。亦將蒙其影響。意奧匈興小恊約之關係。若不能調整。則法意之效好。亦必無由成立。據昨日法國電訊。法外長賴伐爾宣示外交政策時。仍以法意亟應親善為言。可謂一語中的。然由我人視之。關鍵仍在如何解除南意南匈間之宿怨。此而有成。則法意之關係。始能圓滿。否則夜長夢多之中歐局面。終將授德人以可乘之機也。</p>

<h3>榆關法日軍起衝突</h3>

<p>巴黎外國通訊社接紐約電、謂據東京消息、中國山海關方面、有法國兵興日本步哨發生衝突云云、外交部毫無所知、（按英美法意等國軍隊、按照辛丑條約、得在山海關外操演一層、英日爭執迄未解決、英外相僅於十一月四晶對下院宣稱、英政府已放棄在長城外操演之習慣云）、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>西班牙內閣局部乞討組</h3>
<p>總理勒樂自兼陸長</p>
<p>海長羅加兼長外交</p>
<p>瑪德里昨日衆議院開會、討論情形至為騷擾、散會後外間傳說政潮業已爆發、今日經勒樂總理改組之後、閣潮始得避免、閣員更動、已由柴摩拉總統核準、計辭職者有陸軍部長希逹爾戈及外長則由海軍部長羅加兼領、此次局部閣潮、業將慮卜爾所領導天主教黨之政治力量、再度表出、該黨對政府及國會多數黨潛勢力至鉅、勒樂總理所主持之急進黨黨員、主天主教黨所吸收者日益加多、急進黨之所以尚未消滅者、全賴勒樂個人威望、為黨衆所翕服之故耳、目前內閣地位雖較鞏固、但並非確定、一般人以為政治上不日卽將發生重要事故云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>堅持海軍平等日本拒絕英方案</h3>
<p>維護比率英美實一致</p>
<p>臺維斯留倫敦待發展</p>
<p>倫敦日政府已拒絕上星期英休表所提之海軍折衷方案、聞日代表昨夜接到東京關於此方案之訓令、內稱、日政府對英代表之努力、殊為銘威、繼乃於大體上拒絕英國折衷提安內所載之總建議、並重申日本海軍應興英美平等之要求、日代表今日已將訓令之內容通告英外交部、預科目代表下星期將續作談話、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓據美國務院及海軍當局今日之非正式表示、美國政府對於承認日本海軍平等之任何建議、太度仍甚冷談、卽在原則上亦然、官方現仍堅持原來主張、卽華盛頓及倫敦海軍條約已予日本以防衛平等、美國之計劃　仍事繼續此項條約、海軍比率不應變更是也、國務院已接悉美國海軍談判代表臺維斯之全部報告、但報告中並無如報紙所傳英外相西門頒請臺維斯考慮英國近頃所提出之對案、及在原則上承認日本平等之說、據政府當局今日表示、此項請求如果提出、政府必予拒絕、提議者卽為西門外相、亦無分別也、觀察者今日紛紛解釋英國徵求美國對於三角恊定失敗後英美海軍合作意見之舉、據其結論、英國亦不望日本能接受其對案、蓋實際上英國反對日本海軍之實際平等不遜於美、不過欲使美國擔負拒絕之全責耳、國務院今日宣稱、海軍談話現狀如此、臺維斯仍留倫敦、而不赴日內瓦參加十一月二十一日舉行之軍縮主幹委員會議、改由威爾遜代表出席云（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦據今日此間可恃方面消息、如日本實行其取消華府海軍公約之意思、則海軍局勢殆將有新發展、設日本果有此舉、英美二國將在雙方根據上繼續其現有之談話、以準備可興多方妥恊有關的新約之地步、英美代表業已討論及此、如三角談話竟歸失敗、則英美二國之提議、將在明年海軍大會中由世界各海軍國討論之、屆時或可產生一種公約、可許日本隨時加入、目前日本對於英國妥恊案之覆文、迄未送逹倫敦、聞日本閣員現待日皇檢閱陸軍年操、因此覆文遲未覆、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>東京訓令到英</h3>
<p>日代表團深夜集會</p>
<p>倫敦日本政府對於英國提案之對策回訓、十六日下午始到日本代表團、其內容似謂英國提案興日本根本方針大有距離、再向英方說明日本主張、日代表團接到訓令後卽時開會、至夜未散、（十六日日聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦日本政府對於英國海軍建議之答案、業已寄到、其對於海軍問題之見地、未見有何變更、一般人相信日本復文、仍保持該國代表山本少將到倫敦時所宣布各原則、日本代表團左右人物宣稱、東京政府願努力避免海軍談話之失敗、但一般人以主日本前此所表示之見解、恐無變更之可能、似此海軍談話現已陷於僵局、而打開僵局之舉、宣由美國代表團出之、日本大使館參贊加藤今晨前往外交部訪問該部海軍專家克萊奇、告以日本代表團已接到回訓、要求儘速召集英日兩國代表團、惟外相西門目下不在倫敦、兩國代表究將於何日集會、克萊奇未能明言、首相麥唐納本日在迄葛斯別墅請美國代表團午餐、日本復文業已寄到一層、已由外部用電話報各矣、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日準備毀海約</h3>
<p>要求明年開正式會</p>
<p>東京政府決根據既定方針、於來月上旬通告廢棄華府條約、現正準備一切、同時不問倫敦預備會商之成否、將以廣田我相之名、向中外發表聲明書、主張明大約如下、帝國政府並不希望因廢棄華府條約、致惹起無條約狀態、及誘致建艦競爭等事、蓋極欲訂立能逹到真正軍縮這條約、此已在預備會商明白表示者、而竟不得締約國滿足之同意、殊為遺憾、然確信世界不問締約國預備會商之成否、希望以畢府條約二十三條之規定為基礎、於明年開正式會議、再檢討日本之主張、關於新軍縮案之調整再事審議（十七電通電）</p>

<h3>四國訂恊定說</h3>
<p>意法接近相當困難</p>
<p>倫敦英國政府期望日本代表團將向英國開始交涉商議妥恊問題、然日代表團至今尚未表示任何意見、據聞現有一說、如日本政府拒絕英國提案、則由英美法意四國訂立軍縮恊定、英國政府如遭日本拒絕、則希望四國恊定成立、為明顯之事、然美國不願日本不參加恊定、且意法之間對於恊定有種種困難問題同、故四國恊定說似無實現希望、美國政府以日本海軍為目標、欲訂條約、會言明僅以四國恊定艦型及其他質量的限制之事、美國絕對不能同意、（十六日日聯電）</p>
<h3>英自治領大臣力闢歐洲戰謠</h3>
<p>各國猜忌確為造成戰爭因素</p>
<p>否認興他國訂任何秘密恊定</p>
<p>國際調查軍火貿易固所歡迎</p>
<p>倫敦海外自治地事務部大臣湯姆士、今日在蒙茅資廈之新港演說、謂戰爭之說甚囂塵上、但渠覺此說未有理由、就英國而言、英政府從未直接或間接對於歐陸有何秘密恊定、英政府確遇有種種困難、而海外興歐洲確有造成戰爭精神之因素、如猜忌惡意等是、但現傳之戰爭說、渠未見其理由云、湯姆土繼言及軍炎貿易問題、謂人有對此問題深覺惶慮者、渠固知之、但各國中之以領照方法、由政府切實管理軍火之輸出者、厥為英國、以渠所知、英國已在過去三年內因此謝絕價值千百萬鎊之軍火定單、而他國則坐收利益、蓋英國之所為之他、英國將繼續對於軍火製造興輸出、不予以政府之輔助、渠甚願他國亦依此而行、茍有調查軍火貿易之真正地位者、渠願歡迎之、渠信其結果可表示英國殊有可以自矜者在焉云、（十六日咱透電）</p>
<h3>邱吉爾危言聳聽德國教民以戰</h3>

<p>倫敦極右派保守黨前財相邱吉爾、以無線電發表演說、力言德國危險之擴大、其結論中之扼要語、謂［英國應設法使其空軍成為歐洲之最強者］、邱氏又謂、德國突起、吾人其俯首就降乎、否則卽須從事準備以預防之、避免戰爭之唯一方法、惟在使維持各平方面之力量、能較彼方超過三四倍、維持和平全在有優越之勢力云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>宋發祥致答詞</p>
<p>宋氏答詞云、鄙人以出席五全大會、於日前返國、來時受荷印中華商聯合會之託、興國內各廠商接洽、在南洋推銷國貨事務、嗣以五全大會延期、所以鄙人先至華北、週歷平津青島等處、今日至滬、又蒙諸位開會歡迎、具見諸位對於國貨之熱心、及對鄙人之厚意、鄙人以為推銷我國的貨物於南洋的市場、的確是商務之急、此事興諸位個人的利益、及我們國家的前途、皆有重大的關係、因為一現在世界經濟恐慌、我國的工商業尤不景氣、我們今後如欲求生存、而免於破產、必須振起全副精神、打開一條新路、二現在世界上各強盛的國家、皆是因著工商的發逹、我們的一日不發逹、則我們的國家、決不能富強、三現在世界各國、通貨競爭日甚、我們中國對外貿易、每年入超的數目、令人心驚、結果、使我們的金銀完全流出、而使我們金融枯竭、倘欲根本挽救、必須增進出口貿易、否則無用何人為的方法、終不能保守我們的現銀、維持我們的金融、四有人說、我們國貨、現尚不能自終、如何能說至推銷海外、不知現在的世界、交通發逹、成為一整個的經濟單位、任何國家、不獨閉開自守、如欲工產業發逹、必須廣東市場、愈不對外擴充、愈不能在內發逹、所以決不可存先自給而後外銷之錯誤觀念、由上四條看來、可知在外推銷國貨、是異常重要、而在南洋方面、則不但有必要、而且有可能不僅有可能、而且是極有希望、因為一我們產業落後、所出貨物、品質較劣、歐美各國人民慣用精美之特品、我國產物自然不甚合用、然在南洋一帶、居民多係土人、生活程度較低、物品祇須價廉、品質雖稍粗、尚無大妨礙、二就地理方面說、我國實處絕對優勢、歐美無論矣、矣日本之工業中心地帶而論、亦不如我國之近、三南洋一帶、我國僑民甚多、只荷印一地即有一百餘萬、人數遠過歐人或日人、並且華僑在商業上有極大勢力、愛國之心、亦無復加、只須有國貨可銷、則彼等無不努力、四現在我國僑商已漸有大規模之組織、興極組成中華商會聯合會、所以將來國貨推銷、更易進行、由以上四條、可見在南洋推銷國貨、不但有必要、而且有可能、只須諸位努力、前途不可限量、至於實際進行的具體方法、謹向諸位簡單的陳述一過、鄙人個人興當地華僑、愛國愛同胞之心、不敢後人、將來對於諸位、隨時必皆竭誠幫忙也、普通所謂南洋羣島者、即指暹羅。法屬安南。美屬菲律賓羣島。英屬馬來羣島。波羅洲、荷屬東印度羣島等處、這些地方、各有各的特殊情形、絕不能混為一談、常人以為南洋羣島、是一整個的市場、乃是錯誤的觀念、單說荷屬東印度羣島、其大島有四、小島十餘、其幅　有河北河南安徽山東四省加在一齊之大、人口有六千三百餘萬、其中土人占百分之九十七、華人占百分之一。七、歐美人（連荷人在內）占百分之零二、日本人一共不過八千、無比例之可言、聞於資產方面、一九三三年荷印政府所得稅（ＬＯＣＯＭＥ　ＴＡＴ）報告、共收到四千八百𥐛盾、土人、其中百分之五十二收自華人、以華人之人數比例、百占如此高的稅付、華人的經濟的地位、可想而知、論地理荷印正在赤道、四李皆如我國夏秋的天氣、既無寒暑之分、物品亦無按季更換之必要、這是很顯然的、有上面簡單的背景、我們試看推銷國貨的問題、荷印諸島、乃是基本原料出產之地、如石油。錫。茶。糖。橡皮。咖啡。等物、是物品價廉適用、即能銷售在這個市場、國貨所以不能暢銷、乃係有別種原因、大凡廠家欲營出口貿易、其資本規模均須較大、我國廠家、規模甚小、即不能利用多量經濟的利益、又乏完善的組織、這種小廠家、年來愈多、國內市場競爭愈烈、利薄途盡、長此以往、均無出路、這種情形、我們不能沒有深刻的認識、我國國際貿易、年來入超驚人、加上世界經濟恐慌、使我國更難維持、解決這個問題、我商界同胞、負有很大的責任、我們的辦法、不只在國內推銷國貨、同時我們更須到國外推銷、惟有積極經營出口貿易、否則我國際貿易之不均衡、無法解決、這是我們應當認識第二點、我國銀行、素來放欵、利息甚商、如日本在荷印、之入口商、向銀行借欵、最高不過周息五六釐、英美商利率更低、我國銀行、則商出一二倍之上、同時因為我銀行規模小的關係、放欸又不能太久、以免周轉不靈、這種情形、給我出口廠家無形中很大的負擔、因為這種擔負、我廠家即不得不向代理店或承銷人、訂很不適宜發展銷貨的條件、這樣一來、國貨在市場上、就無法競爭、這是我們應認識的第三點、國內廠家、對於廣告宜傳、在荷屬印度方面、非常落後、就是這一個缺點、將來就可以喪失國貨在荷屬的現有極微的地位、時有廠家、不但不宣傳、痰盂且連自家的商標、均不肯在當地注冊、代理店或承銷人既不得廠家廣告的貼補、一旦貨品暢銷、即被別人來假冒　這個問題、在荷印方面、十分嚴重、在談推銷國貨時、這是不能不認識的第四點、再有我們應當認識的、就是我們做生意的立場　谷語說、［知已知彼、百戰百勝］、這句話說的實在不錯、荷印的市場、是有特殊情形的、這點下面、再將細說、不過我廠家最大毛病、就是時有連出口貿易的手續、船運的費用、及興當地他人貨品所鏡爭的價格、通無相當的影響、不是代理店定價太高、就是物品裝璜不合當地市場的心理、我們要知疲乏　打算在荷印推銷國貨、我閃須迎合當地的需要、一方面質量要改良、以便　興人競爭、一方面要改裝、以迎合市場的心理、這是我們須認識的第五點、在這種情形之下、我們對荷印推銷國貨的計劃、不能不有統系的研究一下、如果瑞在我們再忽略下去、恐怕最近的將來、就無法收拾了、因為國內廠家規模均較小、惟一適當的辦法、即是大家聯合共同向外人競爭、這種組織、不能只限精神團結、並且須實際聯合、組織推銷公司、職說上海　已有數十廠家、聯合向南洋推銷國貨、這的確是最適宜的基本原則、因為第一、我們廠家可以減少在國內競爭、第二、可以助我國際貿易的不均衡、於國於已、兩獲利益、近年以來、日人在南洋竭力傾銷、歐美及華僑商務、多為所奪、荷印政府方面、因此特頒入口限制令、華僑商業、賴以保全、否則、不數年間、即將潰滅無餘、國內方面、對此條文、多不明瞭、以致識會、本總領事館即設荷屬、當然不能放棄責任、總求待遇平等、相信荷印政府、絕不會單獨對我不利、感情方面、華荷兩國邦交甚篤、正治方面、絕不無阻礙推銷國貨問題、況現在荷印華商總聯合會、業經成立、國內廠家、如亦有相當聯合將來兩方相助、非常容易、這也是鄙人回國來的一大使命、同時也是在推銷國貨進程中、很必要的途徑、上面談過爭行的要緊、所以在推銷國貨計劃之中、銀行方面、不能不有相當的扶助、過去的歷史告訴我們、外商現在最利害的手段、就是長期放賬、在鄙人所知道的、是有日商放賬、甚至五六個月之久、我入口商、因為銀行利率太高、不能有同樣的競爭、在這不景氣的時光、沒有銀行的扶助、推銷國貨、是不能成功、荷印的市場、很顯然的分為三等、上等市場、多是歐美人士、及富有的華僑、對國貨的觀念很壞、無法改變、但是這等人數不多、方才我們也談到、全荷屬十分之九、都　是土人及華人、所以中下兩等市場、是最緊要的、中等市場、都是華人及富有的土人、現在國貨可推銷一點之原故、也就是這些華人的提倡、下級市場的土人、完全以價格為轉移、我如欲推銷國貨、非減低成本售價低廉不可、我們絕不相信國仙不能興日貨競爭、特別是現在荷印僑民、對祖國觀念甚強、足可借現在的機會、恢復國貨的榮譽、補救推銷的障礙、但是絕不可因為僑胞的愛國、巧取厚利、這是我們計劃中第四原則、對於宣傳方面、我們的計劃、是應當有初步的犠牲、樣品的分送和陳列、就當效法人家、荷印的習慣、每年幾個大城、組有夜市二三星期、大都借展覽會的形式、歐美各廠均加入、我國廠家、多不肯化錢、但是如果有聯合的組織、許多廠家、共同參加、其費用當然較小、當亦最合宜、總結起來、對荷印推銷國貨的計劃、其原則不外上述五項、一聯合組織、二興荷印總商聯會合作、三興銀行接洽扶助、四研究減低成本、向中下兩級市場進攻、五聯合的宣傳、鄙人此次返國、受荷印商聯會之託、興國內商會聯絡、以謀推銷國貨、始蒙駐巴逹維為、日後如有效勞之處、盡情函信通知、凡能推銷國貨、振興我國實業、無人能辭其責、鄙人當然將盡全力興諸君共同努力、</p>

<h3>特載中國憲法的幾個根本問題（五）</h3>
<p>立法院長孫哲先生講</p>
<p>— 范世勤速記。</p>
<h3>八統一軍權問題</h3>
<p>中國常常有一二省獨立　反對中央、要想永遠把持地方、其中實在還有一個軍權的問題、中國這個情形是畸形的、中央有軍隊、地方也有軍隊、中國完全沒有成為法治的國家、就是因為這國家最重要的條件、中國都沒有具備、最大的阻礙、即是軍權至今還沒有統一、這樣實在使中國不能再存在下去、那是中國的切虘之痛、帝國主義的圧迫、我們得到了痛苦、但不能抵抗、因為抵禦外侮、是要整個的國家力量、比如上海拼命同人家開戰、但只是上海一地的力量、至多也只能說是江蘇一省的力量、即使江水質兩省合起來、也還是只兩省的力量、總不能說是全國的力量、在這種畸形的組織之下、要使國家整個去抵抗外侮、是達不到的、礕如政府發一個命令、要他們抵抗、而他們卻會說、我們是地方的軍隊、抵禦外侮是你們中央的事、我們盡不到這個責任、一個國家、軍權不能統一、力量便不能團結、自然不會有抵抗外侮的可能了、如果說軍隊為國家而設、那末地方就應該沒有軍隊了、一旦地方有了土匪、可由中央命令派軍隊去剿滅、這樣使軍隊絻為國有所有、可是中國現在國家的軍隊很少、就是最大的毛病、在外國軍隊是國家的、不是姓張姓馬的軍隊、也不是某一省的軍隊、所以軍權集中為統一惟一的條件、在憲法中便規定得很清楚的、</p>
<h3>九統一經濟問題</h3>
<p>憲法上把經濟也有明白規定、因為那也是很重要的‘經濟關係全國的人民、一國是一個經濟的單位、我們知道歐洲的經濟單位很多、因為一邦有一邦的習慣、因此大家的關稅不同、各自有各自的單位、中國經濟各處也不同、有些地方用大洋、有些寺言用小洋、而且市價又不同、匯兌也不同、外國人到中國來、認為中國的經濟是怪極了、說中國真是一個笑話、又說錢到中國來、不要去用他、也會不見的、因為各處的匯兌不同、一筆錢換了多次、換到後來、錢就會沒有了的、那就是說中國的經濟不統一、國家的經濟不能流通、各省自已各自為政的抽稅、來保護各自的經濟、使國家的經濟沒有一個系統、那實在是事實、中國的別一省、好像是別一個國家的地方、不是中國的地方了、那末中國有二十八省、便萬為二十八國一樣、經濟單位也有了二十八個了、</p>
<p>歐洲人、無論英國人法國人、在前幾年都很佩服美國人的、以為美國是一個contincnt、只有一個經濟單位、歐洲的地方、等於美國一樣大、可是分了三十多國、貨物不能流通、到歐洲的人很討厭、乘了半天的火車、換一個國家、便要查關、所以美國的經濟便能這樣發展、者是靠著他們統一經濟的力量、歐洲的經濟單位、實在太多、可是中國的二十八省、經濟的不統一、差不多等於一個歐洲、我們現在如其再不開步追上去、幾年一過去、是來不及的、實在經濟的統一、比政治統一。軍事統一。還更要緊、要是這三方面都統一了、國家纔算是整個的統一了、否則、就沒有希望、憲法中規定一種貨物稅、只準由中央抽收、地方不得自行徵加抽收、這是很要緊的一件事、瑞在講的就是上面這些、時候不多、所以不再多說了、（完）</p>

<h3>自信</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>自信是什麼呢？就是要信任自已的能力，要做的事盡力做去，常常存著可以克服它的心。</p>
<p>上次不是呌你們立志嗎，好！我們有了志向，有了實行志向的計劃，我們就要實行，志向看去雖很安緲遠、計劃、我閃就要實行，志向後退，有勇氣，我們相信我們的能力，盡我們的力做去，總有一天，可以達到目的。</p>
<p>假使沒有自信力，望著志向，計劃怕起來，不敢實行，那有什麼用呢，志向永遠那麼好，那麼遠大，然而你永不會得到。</p>
<p>國父不說過嗎，［有了信仰，才有力量，］你連自已的能力都不信任，還有什麼力量去實行志向呢！</p>
<h3>世界名人的童年</h3>
<p>— 蔭</p>
<p>甘地</p>
<p>甘地是印度不合作運動的領袖，小朋友們一定都經聽見過他的名字了。他是印度人，他父親呌加巴甘地，他在一八六九年十二日生的。</p>
<p>他小的時候，天資很笨，六歲時進小學讀書，對於功課方面，不大有興趣，一和乘法口決表，費了許多時間才弄得懂，過了一年，因為他父親到拉各提去做大臣，他又轉到那裹的初級小學，但是，他仍舊是一個平凡的小學生。</p>
<p>但是，當他進中學以後，一切都不同了，品行功課是十分濟意，而且一年比一年良好起來。可是身體非常襄弱，看別人在運動遊玩，他只是站在操場角裹觀看。因為印誣人信［耆那教，］是以不殺生為信條，甘地當然也是教徒之一，這時候，一般青年，因為要強健身體，倡行內食，也有人來譏諷甘地這樣的弱小，勸他肉食，但他篤信宗教，決不改變，不過注意運動，並常常散步，以使身體強健。</p>
<p>甘地在十二歲時，就結了婚，但他痛恨自已的早婚，而使身體衰弱，妨害學業，他會這樣說過：［和我這樣遭遇的人，真不知有多少哩！一面讀書，一面結婚，這是害了一生一世！］</p>
<p>甘地長大以後，就當律師，為人公正，極得人民信仰，後來被舉為革命運動領袖，宣傳自治，要求獨立。一九二○年七月二十八日，甘地宣言，不和英人合作，並實行抵制英貨，自創手織布機，自紡自織以為提倡。被捕以後，絕食以示決心，甘地的精神，真值得我們倣傚呀！</p>
<h3>靠自已</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>自種樹，自砍薪。強筋骨，振精神。自已事情自已做，何必處處煩他人。貪懶變做不了漢；勞動煉成難壞身。現在世上勞工神聖，勸諸君莫再因循！</p>
<p>書勤讀，知識長。事多做，身體強。萬兩黃金容易盡，一技在身當飯糧。許多王孫泣路隅，未見勞人餓道旁。親友財產都不靠，自作自食最榮光。</p>
<h3>日記</h3>
<p>— 重樓</p>
<p>記日記，也是日常一項重要的事件。因為經可以使生活變成有秩序，並且可以助長文思，練熟筆法。</p>
<p>假使有一個人從小孩子的時候，就不間斷記日記，一直記到老：那麼他這積存起來的幾十年的日記，必定是一部很豊定的個人歷史：一部立身處世的經騐巨著。</p>
<p>不過記日記，卻不要太排偶人：那些日常瑣屑的事務，儘可以不必去記，應該常常記些新鮮的事實或感想。</p>
<p>有一天，我翻開我的小妹妹的日記，看見伊所記的總是幾點鐘起床，幾點鐘吃飯，幾點鐘到校，幾點鐘回家，幾點鐘睡眠，……這些同樣的文：當時我便對伊說：［照你這樣記日記，除過天氣和時間有變動外，簡直可以刻成版子，每天印一張好了！所以你以後必須改良你這種習慣，在日記上再不要記那些吃飯睡覺的事。……］</p>
<p>父兄的勸誠，師長的教訓，朋友的鼓勵，…者是我們日記上的好材料：如果我們的工作努力，學業進步，記在日記上，那更是光榮的一頁呢。</p>
<h3>秋夜</h3>
<p>— 真</p>
<p>秋夜，黑暗的秋夜，恐怖的秋夜。老天漆黑得可怕，幸虧東方升起了一輸皎潔的明月，和幾點鬼貶眼的星兒，鑲嵌在天空裹，把那黑暗的魔鬼消滅了。</p>
<p>一陣陣肅殺的秋風，刮在那商大的梧桐樹上，一片片的黃葉，向秋連戰抖抖的掙扎。到從來，竟連枝帶葉的飄下來，被人殘踏到地下去了。</p>
<p>在一二株垂枊的中間，夾雜著幾株美麗的丹楓，淡綠的柳葉，參差著朱紅的楓葉，經的調和綠的的，在皎潔的月光下，好像一個青春的少女，塗上了一層薄薄的脂粉，多麼美麗呀！可愛呀！</p>
<p>在墻腳邊，瓦礫間，有一聲聲秋蟲的悲鳴，悲著秋的降臨，同時也悲著自已的生命，快要消逝了。</p>
<p>在雨天的秋夜，一點點的秋雨，打在這青翠而闊大的芭蕉葉上，這聲音好像窮人的悲啼。雨滴瀉下葉來，一滴一滴的，這好像多情人的眼淚。</p>
<p>秋蟲的悲鳴，和著秋雨的聲調，多麼動聽呀！多麼凄涼呀！</p>
<p>一轉眼，殘酷的嚴冬又要光臨了，可憐的窮人，將怎樣過他們凄苦的生活！唉！不忍想了。</p>
<h3>兒童科學講座食</h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>上次我們講過衣的原料，現在我們再來　談談和衣一樣重要的［食］的問題。小朋友們在肚皮饑餓的時候，就需要飲食，幾天不吃，生命就要死亡。但是那幾種是我們主要的食糧呢？</p>
<p>小朋友們一定會回作：［我們餐餐吃的飯米，］不錯，飯米是我們南方人常吃的主要糧食。他是稻的果實，）圖一）稻長萬以後，就把殻打下來，磨去殻皮，春去糠粃，就成白米，不過在北方卻並不拿米做主要食糧的。小朋友曉得北方人喜歡吃的是什麼？北方的小朋友都曉得回答：［我們喜歡吃［饝饝］。是的，北方人是拿麥倣主要食糧的。麥有大麥小麥兩種，（圖二）普通做食糧的，都是小麥。</p>
<p>但是，另外有一種地方，稻麥的出產都很少：於是就拿高梁，珍珠米，（玉蜀黍，）番薯做食品，（圖三四）了。</p>
<p>小朋友們可知道，為什麼大家都拿這種綠葉的植物，來做主要食品呢？這是因為綠葉的作用生成澱粉和織維素的綠故。人類需要的餋料，便是蛋自質，脂肪質，澱粉質，礦物質的水，這幾種，而澱粉質，尤佔著重要部分。像稻，麥，高梁，番薯……中，都含著有重要的澱粉。（圖五）所以仌就拿它們來做主要的糧食。不過澱粉是由極微細的粒子聚集成的，粒子的外面，包有強紉的薄膜，不容易溶化。經煮過以後，薄膜破碎，溶於水。尤其是和睡夜混合，變成糖素而容易消化，所以吃東西的時候，必須細嚼，使澱粉和唾液密切混合，急速地變為糖類。</p>
<p>除了澱粉質的食糧以外，至於其他含蛋白質，脂肪質，……等食品，肉，魚，鷄蛋……（圖六）也都是生命的要素。所以我們的食品，如果不攝取相當量的適宜食物，便易得到營餋不良的結果。</p>
<h3>小常識</h3>
<p>— 乾綽</p>
<p>一怎樣避去觸電的危險</p>
<p>每當雷雨交作的時候，我們為了要避去觸電的危險，不要去靠近那些易於傳導電的物體；如火爐旁，墻壁下，自來水管等處。假使在戶外的話，不宜立在高的地方，更不宜站在大樹的下面。</p>
<p>二睡眠前的注意</p>
<p>每天工作完畢之後，就要有適量的睡眠，第二天才精神來做事，因此我們對於睡眠這件事，不能不有相當的注意。睡眠之前，不可過度的讀書或工作，在床上也不宜看書（因為這是對目力有害的）。睡時不要仰臥，不然往往會做惡夢。因為心慮和胃都在人體左面，所以睡時最好向右側睡。</p>
<h3>做我們朋友的鳥類</h3>
<p>— 尼衡</p>
<p>在美國的南部，向來是產棉出名的地方。那裹有六十多種鳥，是專門吃棉田的中害蟲的。有一種生角的百靈，每一頓最少也要吃三四十隻害蟲！所以在那裹，鳥類要替農夫奪回不少的錢哩！</p>
<p>我們每當聽見烏鴉呌，［笳笳笳］地就覺得很討厭：抬起頭來，又看見它一身烏黑的習毛，更覺不快。但是，那裹知道它們實在是一種很有用的益鳥哩。它每吃一頓，至少要吃掉三十隻蚱蜢！一羣鳥鳴的食量是多麼的可觀！不知要吃掉多少的蚱蜢呀！</p>
<p>可愛的杜鵑，第一分釧能吃掉四十隻毛蟲，這是多麼的爽快！會經有人解剖過一隻杜鵑的胃，發現二百多條的毛蟲呢！小朋友們，想罷，它是我們人類一個多麼好朋友。</p>
<p>兩隻貓頭鷹，每年可吃掉四百隻小老鼠。和三十隻大老鼠，有時它們還要吃掉六隻鼩鼸呢！小朋友，你想這種種有益的鳥，是不是值得稱道，值得做我們的好朋友呢？</p>
<p>願你們對於敵人，也像這些鳥之對於害蟲一般！</p>
<h3>童話故事</h3>
<p>— 秦倩佩女士作</p>
<p>一豬大哥開著車子，出去玩耍，路上碰著狗弟弟：二牠得意洋洋的開著快車，幾乎把狗弟弟撞倒了；三豬大哥雖然開著特別快車，但是沒有認請前途，把車子直我行衝到大河裏去了，狗弟弟快活得乎舞足蹈的說：你戴著藍色眼鏡吧！</p>
<h3>雞狗貓</h3>
<p>— 萬竹小學校二年級學生曹梅瑛</p>
<p>我的爸爸，常常拿張兒童週刊給我看，我看了，覺得很有趣味，所以我也做一篇，家裏的雞狗貓三種東西，都是有益於人的，勸小朋友們也要做有益的事。</p>
<p>公雞啼，報時計，淸早啼來，催我起身上學去，</p>
<p>一隻狗，守門口，汪汪呌着，小賊不敢上門偷。</p>
<p>小小貓，咪咪號，老鼠聽得，不來咬我小書包。</p>
<p>雞能報時計，狗能守夜裏，貓能捉老鼠，都是有益的東西。小朋友要勤儉用功讀書，做個好國民和好子弟。</p>
<h3>德國小朋友的生活</h3>
<p>— 鏡昇</p>
<p>德國的小朋友最歡喜旅行，他們每一個星期至少要旅行一次。他們旅行的時候都是一律用脚跑，不坐車子的。</p>
<p>他們每逢星期六的下午都要自動的組織許多小旅行團，預備星期日岀去旅行。這旅行團有個特别名詞呌做「遊鳥」。他們有的是三五個小朋友一組，有的是七八個小朋友一組，一組中都有一個隊長，管理吃飯問題和交換大家的意見。他們都是自由參加的，他們星期日都能在野外過生活，欣賞野外的風景，吸收新鮮的空氣，練習野外的獨立生活，對於身心都有很大的益處。所以德國人都很聰明，身體都很好，這都是小朋友時代鍜鍊起來的呀！</p>
<p>小朋友們！現在天氣很好，我們也不妨趁星期日學德國小朋友的「遊烏」方法，也自動組織些小團體岀去旅行，這是多麽快樂而且有益的事呀！</p>
<h3>浮沈子</h3>
<p>— 慎思</p>
<p>小朋友們，我們可以利用科學製造許多有趣而簡易的玩具，下面這一種，便是根據［空氣壓力］的原理做成的。</p>
<p>拿一個雞蛋，把它較小的一頭敲破，使裹面的蛋黃和蛋白，一齊流出。再在破口的邊頭，穿兩個小孔用線弔著一塊小石子。在蛋殻上，面可以隨意書成一個人面的樣子。（如圖一）這樣就成功了。</p>
<p>怎樣玩法呢？只要把一個闊口的瓶，瓶裹注入清水，大概八分高模樣，把盡著人面和弔著小石子的蛋殻放在瓶裹面—人頭要露出水面，水的多少，照此增減。瓶的口上，放一個橡皮球。你要是用手壓球，那人面蛋殻就會渾然沈下去；你一放手，它就能夠再浮上來。所以呌做［浮沈子］。</p>
<p>為什麼會這樣呢？理由是：因為用手壓球，球面嵌入瓶內，蛋殻裹邊的空氣，被他壓縮，容積少了，浮力也就跟著減少，所以沈下。一放了手，球又復舊，蛋殻裹邊的空氣容積增加，所以又浮起來了。</p>

<h3>東華之勁敵英尼斯今日戰西捕</h3>
<p>三分天下試看誰能一統</p>
<p>優游猶太重作史高塔杯賽</p>
<p>李季西聯足球自開賽至今、僅一月半、固不足以測日後之形勢、但以各隊實力而論、東華興英尼斯每戰皆捷、從未一敗、西捕僅於開首軍容不整時敗於東華一次、往後陣容日益嚴整、上週並以七比三大敗上屆完軍法商、其勢洶洶、將來實大有作為、英尼斯初由活棄斯替代作戰、軍容極盛、代英尼斯造成優良戰績、今法隊已調防大連、英尼斯業已來滬、據云球藝之精、不在活塞斯下、以此觀之、東華西捕英尼斯已成本季甲組中之魏蜀吳、三分鼎足、日後誰能不統、基業初開、實不足以言決詞、今日英尼斯初次出馬戰西捕於跑馬廰、是戰雖興華人無關、但以兩隊實力之強勁、關係東華之重大、殊足令人注目、一則以窺英尼斯之真實技能、一則以定將來之局面也、今日除此戰、優游興猶大作史高塔杯之重賽、地點在逸園、前者兩隊為五比五和局、今日之戰、望優游以全力拼之、今日各場比賽如下、</p>

<h3>東華克服西商</h3>
<p>六比二寫寫意意</p>
<p>論表演局勢鬆懈</p>
<p>東華足球隊昨對老弱殘兵之西商隊、會師於逸園、作西聯甲組比賽、雙方陣線弛懈、興趣平淡、東華球員、多英俊少年、前鋒傳遞合拍、射門準確、如風捲殘葉、西商以二比六抱頭鼠竄、觀者三四千人、江河日下、盛況不再、最足以號召多數觀衆之足球競賽、今亦興趣大減、遠不如前矣、人材缺少、後起無人、其主因耳、</p>
<p>表演減色</p>
<p>東華自李義臣判　罰停賽兩星期處分後、先遇猶太、次逢西商、故不以為慮、仍保持常勝軍之榮譽、昨日李寗買幼良亦均因病不克出場、起用乙組中符質彬及許竟成二人、初生之犠、表演堪稱滿意以全隊而論、當然遠不如前、但以敵軍席弱、迎刃而解、上半明以二對零佔先、下半時復以四比二獲勝、總數為六對一、但昨晨會降陣雨、場中臺含水分太重、奔馳為難、傾跌翻騰、戰士大苦、</p>
<p>小試牛刀</p>
<p>聞球敗戰　雙方小心應付、　進亦退、如斯良久、西商五鋒掖誘並進、轉眼突入東華腹地、史篤克遙傳一腳、海德遜發腳射門、球平且急、幸偏門一尺、未遭毒手、大陸送出、戴中軍指令曹秋亭、對門急搗、球急如矢、又以角度稍差未成事實、三十五分鐘紀錄非常難產、洪光近傳馮運佑、再遞小萬、西佛矢腳、形勢危殆、秋亭帶球直入敵門、守門心慌來迎、被曹盤過輕輕撥入網中、</p>
<p>敵門再開</p>
<p>既錄既破、四座看客、眉飛色舞、不勝歡騰、符質彬邊陲活躍、勃琪斯阻攔不得、史篤克以地位關係　、心有餘而力不足、眼見球到中樞、阿戴猛烈攻門、砰然為木柱彈回、馬可羅驚魂落膽、搶球不著、先逢樌倒、家球來得正好、送入敵門、此後往來不久鳴笛休息、</p>
<p>一瀉千里</p>
<p>下半明風雲緊急、東華前鋒取約絕對攻勢、是以西人內防危機四伏、岌岌　不可終日、史篤克任勞任怨、救球獨多、拉遜一軍奪起、連過三關、低線傳中、辛克萊一頂、險破大門、小萬回師反攻、傳入中路、秋這傳到門前、阿戴頂入網內、此後西人愈見不濟、小萬界外擲球、家球球盤到妙處、再立一功、會無已時、又見小曹單刀赴會、高奏凱歌、哥德金手忙腳亂、不知所云、家球遠射造成六對零絕大之數目、</p>
<p>拚死反攻</p>
<p>敗勿餒而勝勿驕、確為軍家之座右銘、東華連勝六球、全軍似有得過且過之現象、反顧西人困獸猶門、抵死反攻、拉遜盤低線、辛克、獲得一球、不移時、右翼拉遜舊地重游、辛克萊立刻脫　離關洵安之覊絆、脫柵奔出、躍起一頂、得球、顧關二將齊來搶刦、辛氏以極輕靈之躱避方式、稍一盤旋、媽射球機會、磊陸雖然拍著、球急仍然入網、成六對二之數目收兵、</p>
<p>東華萬象華</p>
<p>陸鐘恩　顧尚勷　許竟成　陳家球</p>
<p>關洵安　馮運佑　戴麟經</p>
<p>陳洪光　曹秋亭</p>
<p>符質彬</p>
<p>西商佛蘭斯</p>
<p>勃琪斯　海德遜</p>
<p>馬柯羅　史篤克　辛克萊</p>

<h3>歡迎婦女團體代表請願歸來</h3>
<p>— 沁一</p>
<p>在這個禁錮女子成了習慣的倒霉的社會，諸位婦女團體的請願代表，居然立在首都最高衙門的中央政治會議的門前、面著那高厚的墻壁，吃著那凄冷的西風，受著那俗子的指笑，堅決地要見中央委員，這種勇氣，可以羞死那些臨陣退縮的武士。老百姓向來怕官，而況諸，位是女流，見的是大官：此種雄風，可以興矣！許多人功成利在一身一家，或一鄉一區。而諸位所爭的是男女平權的法律：功成則利在二萬萬的女人；甚或因男女平權而得有合理的國家，則利又在四萬萬的國人。勞苦誠然勞苦了，功高也可謂功高了啊！</p>
<p>但是法律是空文，經濟才是實質。真正男女平權，僅僅法律的條欵萬萬不殻。最要的是有如下的工作：</p>
<p>一，鼓動婦女鑽和社會，奪取職業和經濟權。</p>
<p>二，勸誠婦女脫離依賴，惡劣，虛榮，奢侈的奴根性。</p>
<p>三，暗示婦女須餋成忍苦的意志，幹練的才具，以便對職業能勝其任。</p>
<p>四，改造阻礙婦女解放的思想，習慣，制度，……等等。</p>
<p>這工作不是一朝一夕所能完成，可慶幸的勝利，還在遠遠的將來。諸位代表既承受法律平等的抗爭於前，還須領導婦女向經濟、職業的苦戰於後，庶不至有首無尾，而遭風頭主義之議；則婦女四人，受惠不淺了。謹以一片至誠，祝諸位歸來和我們作婦女解放的實地工作，並祝諸位健康！</p>
<h3>指迷</h3>
<p>— 怡</p>
<p>偶然在一張包東西的ＸＸ日報｛社會服務］版［答復來部］欄上，看到ＸＸ女士問：</p>
<p>［現在的婦女，還是回到家庭去好呢？還是向社會走好？這問題天天在腦海裹盤旋。究竟該怎樣呢，先生？］</p>
<p>編者答是：</p>
<p>［婦女和男子同是社會的中堅，但是婦女加回家庭，便是她們向社會走的第一步。女士應該把這一點認清，看作表裹相成的一物，不應該看作［矛盾］的銀面］</p>
<p>的一段對話。</p>
<p>我同情於ＸＸ女士。因為：在剛剛接觸了前進運動的邊線，開始踏上社會的門檻的當兒，驟然又只得這反向的呼號，其間的疑惑，徘徊，無所適從，正是情理中事。我知道ＸＸ女士的疑狐莫決，其實還代表了一大部分知識婦女的心態。</p>
<p>可是我不滿意於編者的答話。因為：他非但不會澈底的，明確的指示出問題的內含，且反糢糊曖昧地給掩飾了［回家運動］的本身的歪曲。說是在替社會服務，這樣的服務，不將使烏煙瘴扡的社會，反更黑漆一團？</p>
<p>婦女回家運動的要點，就發明者（！）的德國元首希特烈和他的御用學者溫格爾所宣言的，不外：一賢妻良母，是婦女的最高理想；而國家則是男子的國家。二取消職業婦婦女，足以救濟失業的男子。這樣主張的悖謬牽強，失卻社會根據，以及骨子裹的真正目標是在分散聯合陣的社會動力；在各種有價值的婦女刋物上是屢有所論列了。這裹，似乎無需我再來多說。</p>
<p>我所不慊於這位執筆作答的編者而欲興以糾正和揭穿的：第一是他的［矛盾］說素；第二是他的煙幕技倆。</p>
<p>試看：既承認婦女是和男子同樣的為社會中堅，為什麼不容許她們來和男子共同支持這社會，卻要將她們從顯有成績的優越工作的地位中，驅回到局小的天地—家庭裹去專事生兒育女？家庭，在現制度下，確還似是社會的起點：但就進步的原則講，牠的範圍，是將逐漸縮小，終至於最後只等於一架寢臺。生為現代人，除努力使一切生活日即社會化，公衆化，還有什麼戀戀於這狹籠的必要？自然更無走了從新回轉去的道理，尤其是滑稽地說這回轉去就是走向社會的第一步。分明要將男女隔成一天一地，卻說　同為社會中堅；］分明是拉他向後退，卻說是向前［第一步］，這奇異的說法，實在太矛盾得可笑。</p>
<p>再試看：那位［編者］的意下，分明是同意而且擁護著舶來品的主張和行動，然而就在希特拉自已，和他的御用人溫格爾，都還是部份的露骨而又垣白地說出他人頭攢動企圖和心事，使聽者可以直接辦認其意義。而［編者］卻故意神乎其詞的說得那黀使人迷眩，來淆亂大家的視聽。而且越是鄭重地要別人［認清］，越是藉此掩蔽著問題本質的歪曲，使你們在不知不覺中，隨入殻中。等你一到家，馬上關門落栓，再休想有重越雷池的［第一步］這真是再巧妙，再詭幻不過的煙幕作用。</p>
<p>當然，這樣歪曲性的說素，是不足以矇蔽明眼的前進女性，相反的，她們還更能給以摘發。然而前進婦女，不過少數中之少數，大部分知識婦女，特別如ＸＸ女士輩，墮入圈大套，而猶不自知上當的怕還不在少數。（卽以ＸＸ日報每日二萬餘銷路言，輕描淡寫的一個毒藥方，傳播所及，當不下四五倍於銷路的人數吧！）這裹，我們除祝望大家隨時隨慎防失足的危險外，尤盼前進婦女，要不遺餘力的做著摘誤發伏的指迷工作！—於杭州</p>
<h3>畜婢問題</h3>
<p>— 鄺劍平</p>
<p>反對畜婢問題，是經常地討論了很久的了，尤其是注意於南國的婦運的，是沒有人是不曉得的。直至現在，並且已經在香港方面實行起來了。是一種登記的取締辦法，現在把香港的反對畜婢運動的登記取締辦法，約略地說述於後。</p>
<p>登記取締，是一種慢性的取締辦法。即興逐步肅清的計劃相同。即是限制增加的登記，每年使各畜婢的住戶登記，按今年興去年之比對，已有減少了。其次的辦法，就是［留］臾［去］的問題。［去］的就是遺回於該婢父母，無條件的發回；而［留］的辦法，就是一律給予以工資，只可以當使喚人看待，不能盧。按這一個方法，本來實在是一個安全的辦法，不過若從再深究一層的事實去細察，實在也並不是一件澈底的辦法。比方，政府設關抽稅，雖然是派了很多人去查關，可是仍然是一般地多人走私的。同樣地畜婢而不報的也不會是沒有的，更何況畜婢的人一定是富有的。</p>
<p>畜婢的人，大概是大家庭中的婦人居多。如一　年紀大一點的已結婚的婦女，因主她們為了自已安樂起見，是常常會去收買那些小女孩來做丫頭。而另一些就是一般新嫁的婦人，照封建俗例帶婢過門的。因此殘弱幼婢的兇手，除了一般沒人道的男子以外，則畜婢的太太小姐們也應該負一點責任的。關亽畜婢情形，我來先說一下廣州的我所目睹的情形。在廣州，是靠近了西關一帶的大家庭中常有的，差不多每一房間都派定一個婢女管理的，正如大機關的工人一樣地多。她們的職務，自然就是太太小姐主人客人們所命令做的事。</p>
<p>畜婢制，原本是封建社會裹的奴隸制。也即如美國前時的黑奴制一樣，只曉得受主子的拘役，服從主子的一切合理興不合理的事體。因為是被動性質，所以原本是沒有了自由的行動。沒有　自由的人，這跟畜禽有什麼分別。愛自由的美國，因為感覺得黑奴制的剝奪了黑人的［人］的權利，也會有林肯的提倡解放黑奴運動，雖然鬧起南北的戰爭，也不可惜。列何況我們中國，畜婢的主子們很不會想到，婢不特也是人，而且也是我們的同胞。所差者只是主子們是有鋼鈿的，而婢是因窮苦而出賣的吧了。因此，無論是參加婦運的女同胞，或者是非參加婦運的男同胞也好，也亟應該起來主人類爭奪人類的權利，來打倒這種封建社會的奴隸制度，因為受役於奴隸的，不單止是女同胞中的婢女，而還有很多在非人道下輾轉斃命的男同胞。</p>
<p>話得說回關了，我們得再深究下去，看看婢女們所受的痛苦。除了上面所談過的受主了們的虐待之外，還有一種更難堪的剝奪。這就是男主人的強姦。這不會是說謊，而且也不是奇怪的事，一個男主人，因了一時的衝動，而利用主子的權威興及金錢的魔力而把一個女子的一生犠牲了的，主子對於婢女，更是一件通常的事兇。如果幸運一點的，就變成另一種壓迫的妾侍；更遭遇慘一點的，一生便算了。</p>
<p>婢女之非人待遇，在我所知的已如上述的了。因此我們可以把那反對畜婢運動的方法商榷一下。</p>
<p>根據慢性的取締的辦法，來取締婢女制，無論如何相信也的收效一定不大的。因為登記的辦法既不能十全十美，而［留］興［去］的問題，也更談不到了。比方，先說［去］的話。把婢女遺回原父母無條件的領收。這是不個談何容易的辦法。賣女為婢的父母，決不是富有，這是必然的理由。在年幼的時候已賣出了，而隔了這許多年，原父母尚存否，這也是一個問題。再至於原父母收領了回去能否可以維持原生活，更成一個問題了。因此。照事理的普遍性來推測，遺回一個辦法，實在是不大走得通的。因為事其不能解決這一羣不可以謀生的失業女性羣，那不是反主無益嗎。其次［留］的問題，既變成了僱傭性質，則對於現失業女性充斥衆多的時候，而主子們對於這一君平素可以操縱自如的奴隸，會甘心地拿出錢來給予工資而繼續地授僱嗎；更何況這一羣女性，是經過解放運動來的，主子們約憎恨是必然的心理，反正有了錢就不愁沒有傭人的現在，經過了解放運動的婢女們，便隨時地者有被解僱的危險。而被解僱後，便只有擠入了失業羣里而已。這樣，便變成了運動的結果是增加了失業人數，便反弄功成拙了。</p>
<p>一個解放運支的重要性，是在乎解放後的效果是有利的。而無利的解放運動，只是空頭支票，反連累了被解放的人受災。因此被聯想到這幾年來的婦女運動脫離了社會運動的羣體運動實在不是一個辦法。我們做婦女運動的也是社會運卻的一部門，因此更應該採取聯絡的戊度，興社會運動者攜手，用羣體的力量向封建制度的舊勢力進攻，這才是一個澈底的積極的辦法。</p>
<h3>巴黎婦女生活的一角</h3>
<p>— 烟</p>
<p>巴黎的繁華，在現代的所有都會中是首屆一指的。不要擔起那些衣服時新式樣，無奇不有地那裹日新又新，理髮店的各種鬈髮像，那精緻而且講究的香水瓶，雖然我們並不嗅著那香氣，立在櫃臺邊看看，也要使我們不能忍止的眼熱起來。但是為了我們的袋裹裝著的只夠吃飯的錢，才把我們要想買的念頭抑了下去。再從另一方面觀，世界的文化同，藝術興思想的新潮流，文學，雕刻，圖書，音樂，再至於那科學及實用的工業，沒有一樣不是趕在人家前面，或興別的歐洲文明國並駕齊驅的！奇妙的巴黎！神怪的巴黎！</p>
<p>凡是大都會，沒有不世界化了的，而巴黎，卻更十二分地世界化了：大腹買的美國商人，意大利的小倫，猶太賊，安南兵……包羅萬象地正是一個百貨公司，在這情形之下，有一種并不惹人特別注意，而大家都是明白的，就是，巴黎的妓女是一年多於一年地產生著。</p>
<p>法國對於女子買淫的規定非常巧妙，當然，警察廰抽得極重的稅，而一個月間她們還要受一次檢騐有否傳染病，準許她們繼續賣淫興否。可是，在這情形之下，那些會在大學念過書，或大學畢業的女學生，當她們找不到正當職業的時候，她們也很願意走上賣淫的一條路，說起來，法國對於職業是開放的，然而究其內容卻大有不同者在，男女工人的待遇仍是不平等，每小時同樣的工作，男子能得一元的，女工卻耍減半。并且窮困的法國，失業的男工之多，自然而然的更漠視了女子方面的，這還是男性中心的他們的社會上自然現象啊！</p>
<p>就是在這繁華的城市中，試一注意塞納河邊的橋洞裹，簡直還以為已是死了的睡著在一動不動的窮苦人失業者，！——在法國是不準沿街頭睡的。——好像那最熱鬧而無奇不有的巴黎夜midgettype喝一杯咖啡要幾百鎊也有的，妓女，嫖客，遊人之外，卻有立在暗角的街頭，面黃憔悴的老太婆，她們手裹拿著報紙，喊賣的，同時，好們卻也是乞丐。就在巴黎大學的那一條直街上，從前在讀書的時候，我從飯店回來，遇到的不止一次：［對不起！小姐。］是一個女人的聲音，我回頭一看，以為最問路者，卻不知她們問我要錢，那時我要讀書而迫於經濟的人，也自然只好回答了她一聲：［對不起。］的了。離開巴黎，到近郊去，像laplace　fontenajaux　roses　cachon等等村中，差不多工人占了大多數，其中只有極少的，算是小康之家，同樣有許多破敗而不潔的白木小屋，那簡直是和中國的牛棚廁所差不多的。</p>
<p>平常所遇見得最多的女子，要算電車上的售票員，咖啡館的女侍，洗衣婦，收拾房間的女侍，飯店侍者，戲際及電影院的侍者，她們每天的收入，只夠勉強維持她們生活，有時會不夠。譬如飯店的女侍，她們每人分派招呼近十隻四人座的桌子邊的客人，但那些座位是不會常常完全滿的，所給興的小賑是百分之一，而在那種小飯店裹吃飯的大多數是學生，至多吃了六七個法郞的，那了給於她們只六十生丁。收拾房間的女侍，同樣也是抽百分之一，—有些也蟲旅館出薪雇用。—一個住三百法郞的旅客，給收拾房間的是三十方，但是她們每天要替你收拾床鋪擦地板，等等工作。一個旅舍假定有四五十間屋子，收拾房間的假定有兩個，自早至晚這一天，她們是夠忙了，從未有休息的時間，我住過的幾個旅舍，那些收拾房間的女侍，沒有一個不向我訴了苦。</p>
<p>總而言之，巴黎婦女生活的內幕，說起來是不能使人相信的。</p>
<h3>生涯</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>記得是上月下著纏綿的細雨的那幾天，差不多每天來聞門子的那個瘦稜的賣雞蛋的女人忽然跡了幾天。這對於我是個疑團，因想雖然是下雨天，她也決不會為了這向好自已罷工的，但同院住的人們卻以主她是怕這小胡同的泥濘。我心裹想，倒也是個理由，她每天來闖一趟，是像黃霉天的太陽一樣稀罕，才會有買賣的，</p>
<p>雨晴的第二天傍晚，當我打外面回來時，那女人已在院裹和她們打著交易了。</p>
<p>［多天沒見了，你哪！］那張青黃的臉笑著，見了久違的朋友似的。</p>
<p>［這院裹者掛記你呢。怎麼了，歇工來著？］</p>
<p>［現在腳還蹺著哩！］在檢著鷄子的靜子姑娘插嘴了。</p>
<p>［真是，那麼容易歇工？頭天下雨那天在深泥裹把腳撇了，］她把左腿伸一伸，［還腫著呢，當天是腳踝帶趾頭全浮起像大瘤似的，全是為的躱汽車啦！］</p>
<p>［没貼膏藥嗎？］</p>
<p>她千訴說貼是貼了，怕再不能好痊了。把挑子擱在我屋門口，我引她進來拿蛋錢。撫著時時在抽痛的腿子，她要我給她的在營裹當勤務兵的丈夫寫封信。</p>
<p>她把地名和她丈夫的姓名背得很熟。　著我拿好紙筆，把手撐在桌角上微笑著：</p>
<p>［告訴他我受傷了，在平日我也知道他少錢所以不向他逼，這回是萬不得已啦！］</p>
<p>［大約要幾塊呢？］</p>
<p>［有三四塊頂好，一兩塊也行。告訴他說，如今是萬不得已，我已呌我們那十五歲的女兒整天背著筐子換取燈了，換下來的破布燈玩藝兒的也夠賣十來個大子兒的，娘兒倆是暫時餓不死，只要沒病沒災的。］</p>
<p>我趕著寫，女人的嘴像放小黃鞭那麼快在絮叨。</p>
<p>［還有什麼沒有？］</p>
<p>一邊兒樂著：［沒什黀了，就說鷄蛋的買賣了也不怎麼好，成本重，賣得貴了人不要，好在儘有批的賣蛋的好挑。錢碼是越來越高了，十天也不定賺得出塊把洋錢來不。］</p>
<p>末了，女人拿著信走了，臨回頭還說：</p>
<p>［這又是三個鷄蛋寄一對信啊！］</p>
<p>過後的幾天裹，那女人照樣天天來，兩端很沉似的扁擔壓著她的瘦肩，像是要塌下去，青黃的臉更繃得緊了。那雙紅紫的手在秋風裹顛震著。</p>
<p>院子裹的人圍著她，我就想起那封信來了：</p>
<p>［你當家的寄錢來了嗎？］</p>
<p>縮著鼻子：［沒有呢，也不知是自已胡花了，還是真窮，盼死人哪！我這腳是好不了的，由牠去。只是娘兒倆都還沒棉襖呢，女孩子大了懂得寒村，老嫌露了肩膀不合式，真也是——］</p>
<p>那灰灰的長長的影子跨出六檻時，院子裹的人吧氣：</p>
<p>［瞧，腿蹺得更利害了呢。］</p>
<p>五天，十天，半個月她也沒有再來，不知道是錢來了去醫腳了呢，還是蹺得走不了路，大家念著念著，恨自已袋子裹不多幾塊錢，不能也學一學人道的慈善家，但想著這想法的不澈底時，便又喟然了。</p>
<p>門口有吆喚［換取燈］時，我總愛跑出去探頭看一看，希望有一個十五歲的姑娘在內，但當我凝視著每一　個背著筐子的女人時卻失望了。</p>
<p>［也許那女孩子裸著肩膀在守著病了的母親吧？］慢慢地走進門時我陰置地想着。</p>
<h3>活屍的煩惱</h3>
<p>— 玖姑</p>
<p>落英細心地擦好了雪花，敷了薄薄的白粉，覺得顏色有點蒼白；昨晚的失眠，這般厲害地掛在臉上，頗有些悔恨。懶懶眼光移在臺上由淺而深的幾盒紅粉，揀了產紅的一盒，撲了一會，稍為有幾分合意，再拿玫瑰紅的胭脂勻好兩頰，拿口紅塗嘴唇，才右手支顧地歇了下來。本來再下一步工作便是畫眉，然而這是苦好的：她的眉毛久已連根柭光了，固然不能不畫；可是近來每天所畫的形式，總是悉鬼似的，不待說比不上蓮芳所畫的那般輕媚引人，連自已本來白眉毛，也比這俊俏多了。</p>
<p>她不急于畫眉，而先倒些香油在電　了的髮上，給整頭的波浪梳得朗朗的。然後得睡衣的領口揭開一些。望望壁上達文西畫的那幅［微笑］，覺得興她有幾分相像，於是自已也微笑了。趕在這笑臉之中，畫好了兩線柳眉；長短合度，濃淡適中，今兒真是傑作呀！子長送這心：僅僅那似笑非笑的小口，都有了很大的勁；後來呌人趕著一羣白鴿上下輕飛，他在這各平美好的霧氣中，才算畫成了。她想到這兒［哼！］了一聲，心想達文西借景生情　的藝術，已被她取來實用了哪！</p>
<p>她望著鏡裹的影子的正面，側面，斜麼一個面，笑面，愁面，形形色色的怪面。這麼一個美好神奇的臉龐，祇留著自已在鏡裹看，不能不說是空虛。幸而這副臉龐是屬於自已，總算在空虛中還有一件美好的實物，聊可自慰。今性別無出遊或來訪的預約，祇有一個空虛，率性穿著起來看個滿足。抽抴裹有的是新製的，秋衣，起初穿了一件緋紅的，嫌牠的花頭大了些：其次穿了一件綠的，又嫌牠是橫格子花的；對於她是豊滿的身材，顯現得有［楊肥］之憾了後來又穿了一件米黃的，形式　條，色色者好，到涼臺上望了一會晴空，覺得此刻的碧雲，日紅葉地，清波水，最宜這清淡的衣衫．在穿衣鏡裹看了自已的腰，看了自已的腿，看了自已的動，看了自已的靜，看了自已的立，看了自已的坐，然後再回到梳妝臺前．滿房前後左右祇有一人，祇有一個能賞識這［完美］的一人，而這人就祇是她的本身，這是多麼的寂寞呀！子長他當然是能審美的，他能畫那麼美的圖畫，談那麼深的難懂的藝術論；然而可惡的他偏不許我裝飾，不許我自已意識是一個美人，這多麼的專利！他對別人倒不專制，惟有對我就處處作對；人沒有感情還有甚麼可說？最不該是最後那一次，他簡直吮我是［活屍］，多殘酷啊！</p>
<p>她於是又把眼光移到壁上，那兒她極不願意寓目的，而現在是恨了，恨來時右可以驅使她往各方面去．她定睛望著壁上時，隱隱約約地又發現了那兩行字：</p>
<p>靜尋煩惱動嫌忙</p>
<p>空耗米糧廢時光</p>
<p>她憤憤地拿了乎帕用力在字上揩了又揩，本來早已看不清了；但等到她坐在梳妝臺前，卻又明明地映右眼廉．這可恨的［瘟屍］！認不吃米糧？誰不尋煩惱？而況我是不個美人，一個美人在這分上是多要些權利的呀！我怎麼能跟他一樣的［蠢］動？跑路，開會，演說，教鼻涕的小孩識字，……天哪！別糟踏了人！</p>
<p>然而子長偏有好麼一個相貌！那副相貌生在一個軟心腸的人身上多好呢？自從他走後，再沒有遇見一個有一半像他的人；而我就像一隻雌的孔雀，雜在一羣雄的鷄裹似的。既生我，當然要生子長，既生子長為甚黀要生他那副鐵心腸？宇宙多麼的空闊，準備我來扮演這人生大悲劇罷？</p>
<p>她那修飾好了的臉龐掛了眼淚，一粒一粒，一串一串，後來性廁倒床上，把臉包在被窩內已罩滿了一層薄暮的昏黑。</p>

<h3>紗花外商繼續拋賣標紗</h3>
<p>本月期會一度進八十元關</p>
<p>紗市仍疲、因美棉狀況軟化、外商仍有拋出、銀拆高至一角八分、致市氣鬆動、同時出紗銷場略見淯澹、惟多頭方面、有小組織、對於本月份而論、非收貨不足以維持穩定耳、</p>
<p>金雞續見疲落</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因外棉不振、且本月份買方收貨興否、尚議論份紜、但場中買戶不多、各月跌三。四。五。六。九角、午後聞現紗交易平平、本月份跌進八十元關口、三盤重行回出八十元外、惟拍至收盤又疲、各月又跌一。二。四角、全日成交統計三萬零一百包、查賣出通記一千三百包、大孚一千擔、大豊一千三百擔、賡豊四百五十包、慎昌四百包、元德五百五十包、仁豊七百五十包、潤康六百五十包、永大四百包、明德六百五十包、長豊四百包、買進同興四百包、百五十包、錦昌一千七百包、明德五百包、長豊一千六百包、元德五百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>鄭橚面鬆動</p>

<h3>美棉田增加為近事實</h3>
<p>紐約十一月十六日電告一週棉市狀況云、本週棉市交易、範圍有限、因欲待明年棉田討盡也、市價起落狹細、三週之初　因有外棉競爭漸減之消息、價乃漲起、聞利物浦在此套進、又有因棉布需求起色而購進者、但南方稍有套賣、散戶了結、而十二月期亦有了結、周業則購入十二月期、以掩護其遠拋出、現貨市況頗緊、故若干棉商、現有收買已領執照的存棉之說、華盛頓傳來、以美棉換取德國物品之報告、已引起注意、惟此消息尚未切實、不能左右市況也、明年棉田計盡、現為一般人所竚待、但衆信棉市刻已準備棉田略增矣、</p>
<h3>外棉所漲亦微</h3>

<p>麥市聞盤後、各月份人心、大致平靜、賣買雙方、交易不暢、惟現洋麥之定價、聞阿</p>
<p>根廷麥仍為九角二分、餘無報信、且粉市因環境不良、逐步小落、故麥市亦甚平軟也、下午各盤、近期仍然軟弱、一二月份初亦軟弱、後以賣戶甚少、進戶較盛、逐見回振、結果本月份較跌三分、十二月份跌二分、一月份跌一分、二月份好一	分、三月份跌三分、現麥市面、因標粉麥跌勢頗盛、喊價亦短去三五分不等、聞出東白麥三元八角二分、紅麥八角、徐州麥三元八角、次七角九分、瑤灣三元七角九分、由福新去三千包、阜豊去二千包云、</p>

<p>（滬北）昨日河下內路到頭二十二一號、市上各色銷胃、新粳破粳新羊杜尖新陳埠客尖早薄稻等均甚清淡、陳白元。陰元零拆呆滯、酒戶略動、市形新粳破新羊杜尖新陳埠客尖陳白元陰元平疲、早薄稻小近角、</p>

<p>昨日黃豆續漲五六分、穎州陳荳　開三元三角九、大連范家屯大粒荳開四元、開原小粒荳開三元七角半、蚌埠次荳亦開至三元零五分、故市場中充滿緊張聲浪、為勢尚看穩固、去路如錫常浙幫辦胃仍不懈、本街廠方亦尚緊湊、且大連電報、荳市續升、所以一般人心均抱樂觀、昨統市成交車輸各荳一萬二千餘包、</p>
<h3>絲茶屯溪珍眉歐銷轉暢</h3>
<p>屯溪珍眉綠茶、自上星期各行發出大批電報後、市面已在醖釀發動中、昨日項商恊和怡和錦隆同孚等多數行家、均因國外來電訂購、粉起開辦、全市成交一千五百餘箱、交易頗形旺盛、惟售盤目六十元至七十五元、較前見跌二三元、此外貢煕針眉等項、亦均有零星去路、形勢漸趨穩定云、</p>

<h3>知識與勞働</h3>
<p>— 雉紋</p>
<p>知識興勞働，乃是兩個不可分離的生產過程。這從社會的物質生產過程興社會的精神生產過程說，自然是任何時代都是如此；即在人類之對於物質生產和精神生產，體力勞働興精神勞働的分工上說。也只是全部歷史中的一定階段，才有此種嚴䈷　的區分。因為知識雖是一種精神生產物，但無論是精神生產或物質生產，都不能不依靠勞働，而且精神生產過程更須依存於物質生產過程，所以勞働就成為一切生產的必要條件，而知識遂不能和蘇働分開。</p>
<p>就人類社會的進化之總的現象說，物質的生產的勞働過程，就是精神的知識的生產過程。沒有物質的勞働生產，也就沒有社會的知識和人類的精神文明，是很顯然的。原始的人類，因為他們的勞働方法，生產技術不發達，所以那時的人不但沒有一切科學，哲學，甚至普通生活常識的知識，而且連思想和用以翻譯思想的𢈪　言也不能發達。野蠻人知道火的功用，乃是在取火燒物烹飪的生產過程上獲得的；冶金興製作金屬用具的知識，也是在逐漸改良石器為金屬生產工具這生產勞働經難忘上獲得的。天文學知識起源於農業需要之時令測量上，數學知識則起源於計算牧畜分配土地等等需要上，乃是一般學者所公認的。要在人類勞働生產進步過程中，才能催促了各種知識的發展，所以近代科學的發達，乃是近代勞働生產的經騐興要求的結果。勞働生產就是對於外在世界的經騐，知識是經騐的產物，所以知識興勞働是合一不可分的。</p>
<p>在人類之遠古的社會中，勞働就是知識，知識者也就是勞働者。因為在那種社會裹，人人都忙於生活，沒有餘暇去單獨分出時間來求知識。而且，每一個人的生產能力，只能維持逢已的生活，沒有多餘生產品去專門餋活一部分人從事知識的探求，因此也就沒有特殊的知識階層，勞働者興知識者，精神勞働者興體力勞働者，在那時完全是合一的。</p>
<p>到了社會的生產力前進了，個人的生產有多餘，有儲蓄的可能時，於是勞働者興識者，精神勞働者興體力勞働者。也就顯明的分劃開來，而形成勞働興知識，精神勞働興體力勞働的分工了。在這種知識興勞働分裂了，精神勞働興體力勞働顯然判別為不同社會層的社會中，一切體力勞働之職業活動過程，常不是勞働者獲得知識的過程。因為分工的細密把生產部門分得極細，一個工作者所能經騐的範圍，不過是全部生產過程知識中之千分之一，萬分之一而已。而那種專門著眼於熟練的生產技術的生產力方式，是不能讓生產者變換工作部門和職業，使他能多所經騐興學習的。所以，一切生產勞働者，當不能超出他所素習的簡單的部分技術工作以外去經騐全部知識。所以，勞働過程很難成為知識之講求過程，很難成為研究學問的過程。在另一方面，那些從事科學知識的探求的人，則不但不大從事於生產之實踐的勞働，而且有的還把知識當作自已的專利品。</p>
<p>知識卽勞働，勞働卽知識，一切精神勞働者要同時成為體力勞働者，一切體力勞働者要同時成為精神勞働者，這種如何使知識興勞働統一起來，如何使精神勞働者興體力勞働者統一起來的問題，實是興發展生產有關的重要的問題。因為，若一切人的職業活動都是學問興藝術的研究過程，都是知識的探求過程，則人們便都可不致對於他的職業感覺無味和乾燥了，而且，在知識的生產上，因為密接於實踐的勞働過程的綠故，也再不至使知識的探求者空費精力，生產些空慮玄妄的精神生產品。因此，我們可以說：人類知識之更大的生產量，將隨這人類勞働的更大生產量同時出現：勞働知識的統一，是社會的精神興物質生產之同時的空前猛進的條件。</p>

<h3>造幣廠參觀記</h3>
<p>— 丁志道</p>
<p>十月二十七日的上午九時，我們師生三十五人，懷著滿腔的熱望，一個很主興的跳上太平公懷的黃甲蟲，只聽見［鳴］的一聲，那無生命的動物卽刻轉動四輸，風馳電掣的帶了我們向目的地而去。</p>
<p>中央造幣廠是在戈登路附近，蘇州河的北岸，離我們的地方不遠，所以沒有多少時候就到了目的地。在廠前的木橋堍下車後，偉大的廠屋已呈現在我們的眼前了。</p>
<p>大門口，很威嚴地站著兩位武裝警察。門左是傳達室，右是衛兵室，正中是一條很寬闊的水泥路。路旁種植著矮冬青和小樹，都很青翠可愛。過了門就可看見一個很大的噴水池，大路在此一分為三，兩條繞至屋後，一為直達正門的大道。從外觀上看起來，那座純由水泥鋼骨搆成的羅馬式大廈，誰都不會相信裹面就是鑄幣大工場；尤其是那幾層石階和六顆抽線的高大圓柱，的確給我們以不凡的感想。</p>
<p>為著參觀的便利，我們將全體分為三隊，而我們第三隊則先在會客室少憇，由會老師同我們談了些滬南兵工廠的事情，並言及重工業在今日中國之重要。</p>
<p>不久，廠中派了一位陳先生領導我們到各處去參觀。他是一個很和藹的中年人。他的面貌是如此地和善，使們們敢於將各種幼稚的問題提出來問他。當時蒙他很精細地將鑄幣的瑣碎的一情告訴我們，使在知道鑄幣的步驟之外，近多了一些有用的知識，真是非常的感謝。</p>
<p>我們最先到的原料間，除了看見許多帶淺灰色的大銀條和忙碌的工人而外，其他都無足稱述。但具裹面的一間鎔爐處，卻是鎔銀的大本營，也是製造洋錢和廠條銀的第一個必經之處。在這裹鎔的銀子，什九是由美國運來的大條銀，這種銀子每條值銀一千兩，內含千分之九百九十九純銀。銀條既被鎔成溶液之後，就把它倒入模子裹去，越片是，卽放入冷水中急冷之。待再從水中拿出來時，已變成許多約半時厚，二時闊，二呎多長的有規則的狹長小銀條了。這裹除鑄這種狹長的小銀條之外，同時還鑄一種廠條銀，（因僅由該廠製造，故名。）每條值洋一千元，是專主銀行作準備金之用的。其形狀，極似關字布（古幣名），為一種有柄的長方銀塊。</p>
<p>輾賑課有兩咱機器，專司輾薄和軋坯的工作。鎔爐處鑄好的小銀條，者由四輸車轉運到這裹來。經過了三四部機器的壓輾，就成為同洋細等厚的長銀條，接著就送到軋坯機那邊去。至於軋坯機器，是有著一個古怪的扁嘴，只要把機器撥動，那扁嘴就會乾脆地，無限制的將送過去的銀條吞下去，同時，已軋成的洋坯——洋細的雛形——卽在機身下孔掉入放著的籮子中。洋坯軋成之後，就可把牠送入烘洗課，去受煉聲和飾彩的洗禮。先是，把洋坯放入盛有酸液的，放聲器似的，兩頭有口的，圓形的銅桶中，在桶的不息轉動之時，一種紅色的液體卽行逐漸滴下。在相當限度之後就可以取出，再經過另一種機械的作用而流入綠色的硫酸池中。據那位廠中指導員陳先生談，這是利用化學作用，將洋坯上的酸化銀洗去。這兩步手續做過之後，不但音調合乎規律，卽在色彩方面也好看得多了。</p>
<p>經過煉聲和飾色的工作之後，卽入於鑄幣的是後階段——軋口和壓紋。軋口的機械很小，但很精巧玲瓏。至於那壓紋的機器，單就其一個輸子而論，已經比我們吃飯的八仙桌要大得多。許多軋口後的洋洋坯，就在它後面的圓孔中灌下，於不停的［軋軋］聲中，印紋的總理新幣，就在它旁邊的孔道滑下。其速度平均每分鐘可生產七十元以上。此種機械共有九架，故其每日產量約在二三十萬元之間。</p>
<p>鑄幣的手續，到這裹可說是已以完結了，但是又恐銀元的輕重不一，所以還須加上一番校正的手續。校正機是一種長方形的小機，每架裝有七八個天平，上覆很大的玻璃罩，以防塵埃的侵入。每個天平之旁，裝有半尺長的銅管，洋細灌入管中之後，卽依次良動的落於天平上。如輕於標準分量的時候，墜於旁邊較低的［輸同管］，而由槽中流至靠身的一個桶內；若超出於標準分量時，則由較高的一個管子，送入外面的桶內。輕重的銀幣既然分開之後，於是用同樣的方法再稱。其輕幣中之重者，重幣中這輕者，卽被認為可用的錢幣了。</p>
<p>銀幣校正之後，便送入計數課包裝，然後再送入銀庫保存。到這裹，鑄幣的步驟纔算是真正完成了。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>別了廠中特派員陳先生之後，我們卽上車歸返。這時，每個人的臉上，都泛著滿足的微笑。</p>

<h3>黃梅調</h3>
<p>— 紹康</p>
<p>黃梅是鄂東興皖西接壤的一個大縣，［黃梅調］就是在這個縣裹發源的。通常都把這種戲視為一種［小戲］，以別於另一種流行於鄉鎮間的［大戲］—京戲。</p>
<p>顧名思義，［黃梅調］既是被視為一種［小戲］，一種［調］，則其內容和演出形式上淺鮮簡陋處，我們是不難推知一二的。現在我就想從這種戲的內容和演出形式上略說一說。</p>
<p>本來民間大衆所要看的是一個情趣濃郁的［情節］。他們所愛的是一個悲歡離合曲折有致有頭有尾的故事。現在［黃梅調］之所以能獲得鄂皖間廣大民衆的一種風靡的欣賞，就是因為這種戲的構造能適合這個條件。雖不必像上海的海派京戲如彭公案，貍貓換太子，封神</p>

<h3>打簟子</h3>
<p>— 兆福</p>
<p>安徽潛山縣通訊</p>
<p>簟子就是竹蓆，是我們在炎熱的夏天非用不可的。蓆子的種類本來很多，其中有一種是用竹子作的，卻是我們王家河的特產。王家河是安徽潛山縣的一個小鎮，鎮上沒有幾條街，生意作得不大，人口也不多，自然說不上什麼繁華了。可是我們這小地方，比之附近的幾個鎮市，如三橋，黃泥港，江鎮等卻要般實得多。這原因就是因為我們這地方出產簟子的綠故。</p>
<p>我若說到我們這裹出產簟子的銷行之廣，你也許會不相信，再不然你就會想到我們這小地方是怎樣一個奇怪的地方。毫不誇張的說，我們這地方的簟子現在已風行到全國各地城市。東北，西北，西南和東南各省，幾乎沒有一省不銷售我們王家河的簟子。遠到南洋新加坡，暹羅，爪哇，蘇門答臘各地，也不缺少販賣我們王家河簟子的簟子客人。</p>
<p>現在用簟子的季節早已過去了。但打簟子的季節卻正在剛剛開始。打簟子的都是農民。打簟子可說是他們的一種副業。到陰曆九月，早稻的收成固早已登了倉（但今年因為天旱，收成很不好），晚稻也已上了［岸］（卽田岸），他們是有了一個可以稍事休息的機會了。但他們是勞動慣不耐清閒的，打簟子便是在這農閒時期裹他們的一種重要的工作。現在就是這種工作開始的時候。</p>
<p>借了債買來的或從竹行裹賒來的大大小小的竹子，他們現在得開始一根根的鋸斷。剖開，削光了；一條條的鋸，一層層的剖，一片片的削。在我們這裹，一個村子裹幾乎沒有一家不打簟子的；打簟子的方法小孩們從小看也看熟了，所以他們雖都不會拜過師父，但一個個也都一樣地是打簟子的能手。他們決不會浪費一點竹頭或竹屑。他們精於知道竹削上的考究，他們也是無不了然。普通的簟子篾質既粗，又不重花紋，又不須著色，技術了自然無甚困難；可也有一種極考究的簟子，篾質要精細，要編得有圖案似的花紋，其中有的還有染色的蔑片滲雜其間以產加其圖案美，這種簟子打起來自然就得要些功夫了。普通的農家是逼供打價格不高或次高，技術不繁或略繁的簟子的。</p>
<p>這種打成的簟子，在現在這種寒冬裹也找得到買主麼？用簟子的天氣是六七八月的炎天，簟子客人也要到陰曆二三月裹才來辦貨，這末看來，似乎農民們指望靠一兩床簟子買米，買油監柴火是不可能的了。其實不然，簟子生意是大買志，我們這小地方儘多著有本錢的簟子行，這種［行］是一年到頭都收買簟子的。在這不需要簟子的時令裹，他們可以把㫺格壓低來收買，到明年春季可以用較主的價格賣出去。農民需要錢用時，他們可以背一床簟子到［行］裹去，他們都是老主顧，價格方面也不用爭論多少，馬上可以拿到現錢回去。不但如此，簟子行甚至還肯放欵的，卽是，農民手邊沒有錢，又沒有現成的簟了可換錢時，他可以向簟子行預先借點錢，約定多少日期，拿打成的簟子來還債（日期不能太長，多亦只能個把多月）。簟子銷路大，不怕賣不出去，這種用放欵方法買來的簟子比普通簟子還要便宜兩角錢，所以簟子行樂得和農民作這簟交易。</p>
<p>農民打簟子的時間，大概從頭年十月（陰曆）左右起到次年四月。四月以後，客人已把簟子運走，他們也農忙了，自然得把這種工作停頓一時。</p>
<p>關於簟子的運銷，這裹我還想說幾句話。簟子客人大都向簟子行購買貨物的，他們來的時候大都帶有一筆不小的資本，大客人有資本多至一萬元以上的，小客人少也有千把幾百。這種客人有的是從遼遠的城市裹來的，但多數卻是從附近各縣各鄉鎮間來的；因為大家都以為作這種生意有利可圖，所以都不免趨之若鶩。的確有許多人因為歷年作這種生意賺了不少的錢而起了家；但也有少數人卻因為作這種生意虧了本，還不起債。簟子的行銷興天氣及市面是有莫大的關係的。今年天熱，簟子生意自然可以，但也不能像此業中人所希望的那末好，這原因就是因為市面不景所的綠故。</p>
<p>最後，我想提一提簟子的價可。普通篾質欠佳的簟子，大致每床從六七角到八九不等（這是照農民賣給簟行的價格說的），一元以上二元以下的簟子比較好些，三四元一床的簟子就很不錯，而且還可以折疊起來。最好的簟子可值價二十餘元，這是一種質料極佳，極細，編製得極精工的簟子。</p>
<p>榜之流一連就是一二十本以上的［連臺好戲］，但［黃梅調］中的確有採取這種類似的形式的。［黃梅調］的演出方式通常可分為三部分：正戲，打彩和插戲。視戲詞之長短，正戲有僅演一齣或二三齣不等的，也有因戲詞太長僅能演半齣，把全本戲分成兩次演的。戲詞很長的戲如［喬麥記］，［烏金記］，［牌環記］，［鳳凰記］，［賣花記］，［三賓記］［訟詞記］，［烏盆記］，［恩歌記］，［狗奶記］，［珍珠塔］，［百花亭］，［山伯訪友］，［張朝宗告奸臣］，［打紅梅］，［雙合鏡］，［魚網會母］………等，多半都能維持一臺戲的正戲，其中如［張朝宗告奸臣］，［魚網會母］等都是有前後本，可以分作兩次演的。這些戲大都可連演至三四小時以上。情節上這些戲大都離奇複雜，哀感頑艶，極適合落後的民衆心理。</p>
<p>每一齣戲裹大都有些個別的小場面，在表演時可以視時間之長短任意伸縮省略。例如［山伯訪友］一齣裹有這些小節目：［訪友］，［送友］，［採藥］，［歸天］，［弔孝］，［哭靈］等，如無時間演全本時，有些場面就可以略去。這些場面如能像海派京戲的那末鋪張描寫，編成連臺好戲也是可能的。</p>
<p>［插戲］是［小戲］中的［小戲］，內容離不掉男女之私。這也正是［黃梅調］被衛道的先生們紳土們所最詬病的地方。這裹面倒多著［連臺好戲］。［插戲］中最有名的是描寫［余老四］和［蔡鳴鳳］兩個人事蹟的戲。關於余老四的有下列幾本：［余老四拜年］，［余老四反情］，［余老四打瓦］，［余老四過蓋嶺］，［余老四充軍］，［張二女十二想］等。關於蔡鳴鳳的有下列幾本：［小辭店］，［牌刀記］，［賣飯女修書］等。這此戲都可以單獨演出，一如彭公案之類每本可以單獨演出。</p>
<p>寫到這裹，我不能［不把這些戲的內容約略的提一提。中國社會現在仍是一個半封建社會，民間的種種風習仍脫不掉封建殘餘的色彩。作為表現民間文化思想程度的民衆娛樂，其內容的腐舊，淺薄是不問可知的。提倡迷信，誨淫，可說是多數流行的民間小戲的通病。［黃梅調］就保有著這各種有害的特質。牠把公子小姐的私情，才子佳人的好合，歸結到個人幸福的小範圍裹去，以見神見鬼山窮水盡出神仙的迷信的方法來打動觀衆的好奇心—這些，對於社會的進步都是有害的。［插戲］中的極露骨的色情描寫及演出，我們是雖不和衛道的先生們一樣無批判的一致掊擊，但我們若一一加以推敲，則發覺可取的地方實屬太少。［打彩］更是荒唐我只段提一件事你就可以明白。打彩為的向觀客要錢，觀衆就可以用種種方法向臺上男扮女裝的演員習難，例如將錢啣在嘴裹，要演吶用嘴來接等等。</p>
<p>但，無論是［正戲］［打彩］或［插戲］，卻都何有著廣大的觀衆。這是我們不容忽視的地方。民間演劇大都題材淺近，用土音土語演出，舉辦起來又多半輕而易舉。［黃梅調］亦自有著這些優點。［黃梅調］的取材就有不少的［本地風光］。自然，［黃梅調］中有許多是脫胎於過去的小說傳奇，崑劇，京戲的，如珍珠塔，烏盆記，梁山伯祝英臺……等，都不是黃梅調所獨有的。崑劇中，紹興文戲中，四明文戲中就有這些節目。但［黃梅調］也的確有牠獨創的地方。［黃梅調］中有許多戲確是有名的事實的搬演。這些事實多半都發生在黃梅及葬東別部及河南或江西的。如正戲中之［訟詞記］，［烏金記］及插戲中關於余老四蔡鳴鳳的事情，據說真確有其事，確有其人，確人其地。如［訟詞記］中的故事發生在太湖，後來打官司打到安慶，南京，北京。［烏金記］中兩個強盜據說是在江西瑞昌縣中捉到的。［余老四過蓋嶺同］，所謂蓋嶺是宿松和黃梅交界的一座山，是余老四從太湖回家要經過的一條路。據說余老四在太湖和張二妹［相好］，至今太湖人還認主不大名譽，太湖的某些地方還禁演這種關於余老四的戲的。由此可見［黃梅調］地方色彩的濃厚。</p>
<p>［黃梅調］戲詞頗多採用村野俚語，簡字，俗字，錯字，充塞字裹行間。早年流行的是一種手抄本的唱本，現在因流行頗廣，皖鄂（以黃梅為中心，東至大通，西至漢口，南至武穴，北至黃麻以上。浙江於潛一帶有洪楊時代安徽的移民，他們也會把［黃梅調］帶過去。）各大小城市有木刻本出現了。［黃梅調］的［不脛而走］興這些唱本的流傳，以及牠的演出方式是頗有關係的。</p>
<p>［黃梅調］現在已逐漸都市化了。皖鄂有些大城市中的戲院，演京戲時［門可羅雀］，改演［黃梅調］卻不免要［風靡一時］了。會有過京戲班子改唱［黃梅調］而達到營業勝利的目的。京戲班中有坤角，坤角唱起色情的［黃梅調］來，不必說，是更能哄動遠近的。</p>
<p>［黃梅調］無疑地是有著牠許多的缺點，但牠能夠採取通俗的題材為通俗的演出，因而獲得極廣大的觀衆，這點，卻是我們留心戲劇問題的人所不可不注意的一件事。</p>

<h3>讀［讀書生活］創刋號</h3>
<p>— 于成</p>
<p>—上海現代雜誌公司發行，定價二角—</p>
<p>在本年之内，先後岀版的雜誌據說有六百餘種之多，這在素來貧弱冷淡的中國文化界說來，總可算是一個少有的盛狀吧。但是，在這五六百餘種雜誌中有好多是為一般人所急於需要的呢？不客氣地說，我們實在找不出幾種雜誌來向一般大衆推重。</p>
<p>［讀書生活］是最近才出版的，我讀了之後，覺得這倒是一種值得介紹的雜誌。在這中間，我們可以看到科學的讀書方法和寫作法則，可以看到關於科學哲學文學的普通知識，也可以看到一般店員學</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>徒們的生活姿態及其學識能力。其中的各種作品，雖然在內容上，文字的技術上有些缺點，但在目前，有這樣一個指導讀書，適合於一般人的要求的雜誌出現，我們依然認為是可慶幸的。</p>
<p>［讀書生活］首先在其［創刋辭］中向我們說：</p>
<p>［讀書生活］提倡讀書是讀活書，是一面為生了活掙扎，一面在萬分嘈雜中利用一分一分的時間去讀書；是把讀書融化在生活中。為了我們要有更好的生活，要使我們生活向上。我們的生活應有一種，知識去指引，不然會成為盲人騎瞎馬。這種生活知識一方面就是接受前人留下的生活經騐，一方面就是在實生活中去開展。我們不能偏於某一方面。所以我們提倡讀書，但一定要讀我們生活需要的書，我們提倡讀書，但一定是配合我們的生活實踐的讀書，我們提倡讀書，但一定是有正確方法的指針的讀書，同時我們反對讀不合我們生活需要的書，興生活隔離的讀書，沒有方法的讀書。］</p>
<p>讀書是有用的，讀書是不能興生活分離來談的，因而也是有正確的方法的，什麼［為讀書而讀書］，［為清遣而讀書，］這些理論是不能自圓其說的。［讀書生活］知道這一問題，所以首先就將其提了出來，並向一般讀者作了正確的解答。</p>
<p>在這一原則之下，［讀書生活］更具體地告訴了我們許多研究的方法。如伯韓先生的［要求讀書生活的合理化］，李公檏先生的［求知識的三條路］，以及［讀書問答］欄中的幾篇文章，都是很實際地談論著讀書問題的，對於一般初學的店員學徒們的讀書尤有很大益處：同時，黎夫先生的［文學可以當飯吃嗎？］，文思奇先生的［哲學並不神秘］，興夫李崇基先生的［談死光］，也都是把這些學術當作人類的物質生活的產物，從社會的見地來談論的，興那些玄學家的論點全不相同。</p>
<p>不過，使我特別注意的，卻是［生活記錄一典［青年創作指導這兩欄中的幾篇作品。</p>
<p>在［生活記錄］欄中，共有三篇作品：第一篇是荘小景先生的［收銅牌那一天，］第二篇是黃曙暉先生的［把收藏在荷包裹］，第三篇是方苑棲先生的［在小洋燈下］。其中第一篇是描寫一個女工的工廠生活，從兩篇則是記錄店員學徒的讀書生活。這三篇東西雖在文字上沒有我們的文學家寫得漂亮，但我相信其描寫的都是非常真實，都不是我們所能想像得出來的。所以，我希望那些永遠藏在亭子間裹，從未了解一般人生活的作家注意這三篇東西，特別是其中的第一篇很實際的文學題材，比你	腦子裹所想的或從新聞紙上找來的題材都要好得多。</p>
<p>［青年創作指導欄中的幾篇創作，嚴格說來都是很幼稚的。但我在此不想批評牠們，我所要說的是［讀書生活］的先生們佛導青年創作的方洗。他們是先將某青年的作品刋出來，然後在其後面具體地佛出其缺點。這樣的辦法，我以為比較要一般青年去讀什麼［小說作法］一類的書的辦法好得多。雖然在他們的這次的指導工作中尚有不周到之處，但我們相信只要長久地這樣做下去，一定會有大的收穫的。</p>
<p>我喜歡［讀書生活，］我贊成［讀書生活］指導一般讀者學習的辦法，正因主這樣，所以我除向一般讀者介紹牠外，更不得不希望牠更加完善。為此，我特向［讀書生活］的先生們提出幾點意見：</p>
<p>一應盡量具體地告訴一般讀者一些正確的學習方法，不應只談中　文化界的一切現象，而不提出具體辦法。因為目前一般讀者所急南大的是怎樣學習，怎樣解決問題，不只是要明白現象，提出問題。但這期［讀書生活］中有些文字就是以說明現象為主而未提出具體辦法的。例如，征農先生的［拿些什麼給大衆讀］，便有這樣的缺陷。</p>
<p>二那些並非一般人所急需的，不能引起讀者興趣的文章，最好是不要登載。我以為像第一篇陳望道先生的那篇文章就沒有刋載的必要，是然陳先生是名人。</p>
<p>三希望以後登載一些有系統的學術論文，使我們看了一篇學術論文後，就能有對於那學術的一個基本概念。</p>
<p>四在實際上，一般人所常讀的書籍，多半都是舊的章回小說。例如苑方棲先生述他的讀書生活時，了說他會愛看［今古奇觀］，［包公案］等小說。但這些東西是有害無益的讀物，［讀書生活］的先生們今後除告訴一般讀者應讀什麼書之外，對於一般舊的但為一部分人所嗜好的不良讀物應加以嚴格的批判，以免讀者受其毒害。</p>
<p>五像［青年創作指導］欄那樣的指導一般青年寫作，自然很好，但只是偏於創作小說方面，未會在指導一般青年學習作學術研究的文章方面盡到責任。實際上，我相信在一般青年中，一定有不少的人是需要這個指導的，所以我盼望［讀書生活］今後能設法滿足他們的這個希望。</p>
<p>六書報介紹宜多一點，以便讀者選讀。</p>
<p>昔日戲言身後事越南臺灣文化近况</p>
<p>— 江亢虎作</p>
<p>［昔日戲言身後事，今朝卻到肯前來。］我國人倘欲預知國亡以後，固有文化成何景象者，請北游大連，南游港澳，尤要者，請更游法領安南　，日領臺灣。安南自素漢以來本為中國郡縣，其後夷為藩屬。除按年朝貢外，聽其自立政府，然其人民大部為中國血統，其文化完全由中國輸出。五十年前，乃割讓於法人。自是以來，被帝國主義根本統制。先從文化入手：遍設法文傳習所，創造羅馬拼音字，禁止公私機關使用漢文。至於今日，除最少數人官吏文人外，大多數人不第不能讀漢文書，乃至本人姓名原係漢字者，亦已不能識不能寫，而但能以羅馬字拼出之。以數十年之政治勢力，消滅二千餘年之文化遺傳，所有歷史遺跡散在民間者，盡數搜羅，入政府所辦遠蔞博物館中，附設一遠東學院，聚法國考古家及安南第學究數十人，研究保存，作篇特殊階級之專門學科，而其影響之及於社會興人生者，則掃地以盡矣！華橋所立學校，亦受嚴密取締：一，教科書成績品須呈報檢查，一，上課時官廳得自由派人監察，一，絕對不準收容安南學生。至於臺灣，則自鄭延平王以來，隸中國版圖者，三百餘年矣！其人民文化語言風谷，皆興內地絲毫無異。四十年前，割讓於日人，凡居留者，一律登記為日本籍民。實行麻醉奴化教育，強制以日本語為國語，公共場所禁用本地語（卽廈門語），公學教科書由總督府特別編製，所有漢字均依假名讀和音。至今三十歲以下之人，除特別例外（如專研究文學者，會受家教者，及留學中國者），無能作漢文，亦無能以中國音直接讀漢文者。除官立學校漢文功課外，不準有任何學習或研究漢文之機關，因此規定，故華僑學校不準成立，中國僑民子女亦不準學習本國文字語言，此真五洲萬國亙古未有之奇聞也。華僑所組織之中華會館，中國政府所派遣之駐臺總領事，雖屢向日本當局請願交涉，亦毫無結果，但曰：［此帝國治臺灣方針，決不變更，亦不通融，并不解釋，惟有服從。］一面用極嚴厲手段，禁止一切類似學校之任何文化事業，拘捕其發起人，贊成人，沒收其產業。於是，中國文化，非經過日本文化之同化者，在臺灣卽不能存在。觀此可知彼妄自尊大者，以為中國文化可以永不磨滅，實係癡人說夢，自欺之談也：又可知彼妄自菲薄者，鄙棄中國固有文化，實係操刀代割，自殺之道也。</p>
<p>小小專著</p>
<h3>中國的農村副業</h3>
<p>— 莫秋</p>
<p>所謂副業，當然是主業的相對名詞。農家的主業，不消說是務農；其在作為主業的務農之外，利用殘餘的材料或空隙土地，利用暇時和餘力以從事生產，幫助其生活者，卽是其副業，亦卽是我們所謂的農村副業。</p>
<p>在過去，中國的農村副業，主要地是農村的家庭手工業，如紡綿織布餋蠶繅絲等是；其次則是畜餋家禽家畜和餋蜂取蜜。但是，自帝國主義的經濟勢力侵入以後。國國的農村經濟便逐漸發生了變化，從而固有的農村家庭手工業等，在中國農村副業中便失掉了主要的地位，代之的乃是種桑餋蠶種茶製茶……等事業。</p>
<p>當帝國主義的經濟勢力侵入中國不久的時候，因為外國企業家努力在中國農村中購買材料，一般農家咸到種桑蠶比較種麥種稻更有利益，所以竟自把稻田麥地用來種桑，同時，因為交通的發展，國外貿易的增加，華茶的銷路也增大了，於是，在產茶的地域內也有一些農家將許多樹木所佔據的山地乃至原來用以種植食糧的地方拿來種茶；這樣一秋，作為農村主要副業的蠶絲和茶類，在我們的農村經濟中更佔了重要的地位。</p>
<p>但是，在帝國主義的魔力控制之下，我國的產業不能自由發展，因而各種實業都不能興人競爭。近年以來，因為外貨的競爭，世界不景氣的影響，作為我國農村主要副業的絲茶葉也發生了衰落的現象。</p>
<p>先看絲業的吧。在人造絲的競爭，日絲的排擠等等影響之下，原來居我國對外貿易第一位的生絲，其輸出額在近年中竟表示出了日益減少的狀態：這在下表中表現得非常顯然——</p>
<p>輸出數額（單位擔）　輸出價格（單位關兩）</p>
<p>民國十五年　一六八，五六三　一四四，八二六，三五八</p>
<p>十六年　一六　○，　○　○二　一二八，七　○五，七三二</p>
<p>十七年　一八　○，一八六　一四五，四四三，四八一</p>
<p>十八年　一八九，九八　○　一四七，六八一，二三八</p>
<p>十九年　一五一，四二九　二四九，四八一，一二四</p>
<p>二十年　一三六，一八九　八四，六八　○，四八二</p>
<p>廿一年　七八，二一九　三二，九三二，二五　○</p>
<p>及至駢年，我國生絲的輸出更行大減，其市價差不多跌至每擔五百元左右的狀態。</p>
<p>因為絲價的銳減，生絲輸出額的日益減少，當然要危害到農家的種桑餋蠶和繅絲的事業。據調查，江蘇在近幾年之內桑地已減少了八九畝，其他如四川雲貴等省的農民，在近幾年來亦因種桑餋蠶的失敗，而將許多桑地改種鴉片。——由此當可見到農村蠶絲業現狀之一斑了。</p>
<p>再講茶業。我國產茶的區域，主要者為安徽，浙江，江蘇，江西，湖南，湖北，四川，廣東，福建，次則為山東河南等省，其產量甚多，亦為我國主要的大宗出口之一。但是，近年以來，因為製法的未能改良，興夫日本印度茶的競爭，我國的茶業也表示出了非常衰落的現象。各地製茶者大多虧折成本，甚至無法維持。據前年七月七日［大公報］所載安徽江西紅綠箱茶的盈虧情形如下：</p>
<p>類別　成本　售價　盈虧</p>
<p>紅茶　祁門（安徽）　四百兩下下　二百兩　折百分之五十　秋浦（安徽）　百兩上下　百兩上下　不折　武寗（江西）　七十餘兩　四五—八兩　折二十餘兩　湖口（江西）　五十餘兩　五十二兩　不折　浮梁（江西）　百兩上下　七十餘兩　折二十餘兩</p>
<p>綠茶　數源（安徽）　五十—百元　百元上下　稍盈　　歙縣（安徽）　現路九十五兩西路六八—七六元　——折本　屯溪（安徽）　一百四十餘元　一六五元　折七八十兩　玉田（江西）　針眉六十兩　三二—三六兩　折二十餘兩</p>
<p>蝦目　五二兩　八兩</p>
<p>因為茶價的日益減少，製茶者的折本，當然要使茶圃的面積減少，影響到茶的出產量。據調查，民十八以前，國內茶圃面積為五，三五三，三五五畝，產額為五，九一五，五七四擔。最近呢？則茶圃面積減為四，四七五，九二八畝，出產量亦減為四，四九九，四國五擔，較之民十八以前，差不多都減少了五分之一左右。——由此當可概見我國茶業的衰落情形了。</p>
<p>其他的農村副業，如餋蜂牧畜以及家許手工業等，其情形也都和絲茶業差不多，可無須在此詳論。</p>

<h3>馬爾騰勵志語錄</h3>
<p>— 吳雄劍</p>
<p>寶貴的生命力之浪費者是不種最壞的敗家的，這種人比那些浪費金錢的敗家子更壞得多。他們簡直是在自殺，殺掉他們自已生命中的種種機會，幸福。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>外界的助力，在當時看來，乎是一種幸福，但最終牠是一種禍害，因為牠能阻你上進。給予你以金錢的不是你的好朋友。能夠督促你，彭勵你去自依自助的，才是你的真朋友。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>貧窮，痛苦，不是永久不可超越的障礙，而反是人們的刺激品，以鍜鍊他們的身心，使得成為更堅毅，更強固的。鑽石愈硬，則牠的光彩愈耀目；而要將其光彩顯出來時所需的磨擦也愈多。只有磨擦，纔能使鑽石顯示了牠全部的美麗。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>你的工作就是你的生命廠像。也之為美為醜，為可愛為可憎，全操於你自已之手。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>每晨出發工作時，你當下一決心；力求在職務上，較之昨日有所進步。你當把事情弄得比昨天更好些，然後在傍晚離開你的工廠，辦公室或別種工作場所。每天你當謀若干之進步。每天你當走前幾步，走上幾級。這樣，一年之後，你會發現：你的職務事業有著可驚的進步。</p>

<h3>The Capital Conducted an Air Defense Drill; All City Organizations Were Fully Mobilized; Three Teams of Aircraft Dropped Bombs from the Air</h3>
<p>A Nighttime Air Defense Drill Was Held Last Night at 8 PM</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Attacked; Searchlights Were Activated Simultaneously</p>
<p>All City Lights Were Extinguished; The Scene Was Extremely Realistic</p>
<p>Nanjing, 17th: For the air defense drill in the capital, all organizations were fully mobilized. A rehearsal was held at 7 AM, and a lighting control rehearsal started at 8:30 PM. The air defense rehearsal at 7 AM was held at the public stadium. Party, government, military, police, sanitation, self-government, fire, school, Boy Scout, and other organizations sent personnel to the venue to participate in the work, totaling more than 2,000 people. The situation was enthusiastic. Two small airplanes simulated an air raid on Nanjing. Each team engaged in defense, all streets stopped pedestrians, and fire and rescue drills were carried out. The drill ended after 11 AM. The evening air defense rehearsal started at 8:30 PM. Lighting control was implemented, and airplanes circled in the air and released red signal flares as substitutes for incendiary bombs. At that time, all city lights were extinguished. The actions were rapid and coordinated, lasting for 20 minutes. At the same time, military and police units strictly guarded and repaired, and the entire fire brigade was dispatched. Citizens, due to days of air defense propaganda, were quite aware of the situation, and order was good. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, 17th: At 8 PM tonight, the capital held a nighttime air defense drill. At that time, according to a report from a certain monitoring post, a team of enemy aircraft was flying towards the capital to attack. The alarm agency issued an air raid alarm at 8 PM. The garrison troops and traffic control teams, as well as the lighting control team, were dispatched to designated locations at the time of the air raid alarm, and were strictly equipped to implement alert. Soon, according to a report from a certain monitoring post, enemy aircraft were approaching the capital. The alarm agency issued an emergency alarm at 8:30 PM. The capital power plant implemented lighting control when the emergency alarm was issued. The entire city was dark, and all shops closed one after another. Except for those holding passes, vehicles, horses, and pedestrians were all prohibited from passing, and traffic was completely cut off. Everything was silent. Senior officials all went to a certain high ground to inspect. When enemy aircraft flew to a high altitude over Nanjing, our searchlights simultaneously emitted strong light to search for enemy aircraft. Enemy aircraft dropped five bomb signal fires, circled half a round, and then fled in panic. The scene was extremely realistic. About 18 minutes later, it was reported that the enemy aircraft had been repelled. The alarm agency issued a cancellation alarm, and normal state was restored immediately. The entire city regained light. The reporter from the Central News Agency went to various places to inspect when the lights were off and saw that the lights in all households were completely extinguished, or covered with black cloth or black paper. Only a few who had their own generators extinguished them later. As for the various groups responsible for the alert, they each fulfilled their responsibilities for traffic control and maintaining public order, and their performance was excellent. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, 17th: In the capital's air defense rehearsal, all actions were simulated with three teams of enemy aircraft attacking Nanjing from Hangzhou. At around 9 AM, the air defense department received a report and issued an air raid alarm. The fire, rescue, and traffic control brigades were on standby for deployment. At 10 AM, an emergency alarm was issued in Nanjing, and the atmosphere in the whole city was tense. The traffic control team paid attention to organizing traffic and guiding evacuating pedestrians. The Huangpu Road area was cut off to traffic to maintain the activities of the air defense forces. The fire brigade intensified its lookout and patrol, and the rescue team implemented rescue operations. At 10:40 AM, three teams of enemy aircraft arrived in the sky over Nanjing simultaneously, flying at extremely high altitudes, and dropped many bombs, totaling three types: white, indicating explosive bombs; red, indicating incendiary bombs; and green, indicating poison gas bombs. It was also simulated that the area near the public stadium was hit by bombs and caught fire. The fire brigade assembled fire trucks and dispatched water dragons to irrigate with all their might. At 11 AM, the enemy aircraft were forced to fly away, and the cancellation alarm was issued. The drill then ended. Then, all the drill groups gathered at the stadium, where He Yaozu, Shi Ying, and Huang Zhenqiu gave speeches, saying that the spirit of the rehearsal personnel was uplifting, and also saying that the points to pay attention to in air defense were: first, the important political areas should be protected; second, the entire population should be mobilized. The meeting adjourned after the lecture at noon. Lighting control was carried out starting at 8 PM in the evening. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>London: Today's editorial in the Times stated that the Chinese Central Army has been fighting the Communists in Jiangxi and Fujian for a long time, and is now gradually coming to an end. Before this autumn, the Communist Party's flames were quite strong, but Chairman Chiang Kai-shek applied economic and military pressure, lasting for a year. If he does not slacken, he will eventually drive the Communists out of their base in Ruijin and surround them. The Communists, with shrinking land, are now planning to break through the encirclement and flee west. Fortunately, Guangdong and Yue Central have cooperated to jointly suppress the Reds. If they can be confined to one corner and not flee elsewhere, then the destruction of the Communists will almost certainly become a reality. The Communists have the possibility of fleeing to Sichuan. Liu Xiang is determined to ask Chairman Chiang for help. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>Italian-Yugoslavian Relations and the European Situation</h3>
<p>— Heng.</p>
<p>According to recent telegraphic dispatches, relations between Italy and Yugoslavia are again deteriorating. Yugoslavia accuses the Italians of distributing anti-Yugoslav pamphlets, while Italy is greatly dissatisfied with Yugoslavia's open anti-Italian demonstrations. Thus, the animosity and suspicion between the two countries since the end of the Great War seem poised to erupt. At the same time, relations between Yugoslavia and Hungary are also worsening, indicating that, although the Marseilles tragedy did not trigger a second world war, it has severely threatened the balance of power in Europe, which had been painstakingly maintained by Barthou.</p>
<p>Barthou's foreign policy aimed to unite the countries of Europe to isolate Germany. This is well known. His achievements include: (1) the alliance between Russia and France; (2) the solidarity of the Little Entente; and (3) the affiliation of the Balkans. Other goals, such as the promotion of Franco-Italian friendship and the improvement of Italian-Yugoslav relations, were also part of Barthou's plans, but they ultimately failed due to the Marseilles attack. After that incident, we predicted that French diplomacy would continue to follow Barthou's legacy, but with changes in methods and techniques. Indeed, more than a month has passed since the Marseilles tragedy, and not only has there been no success in Barthou's unfinished work, but obstacles have also arisen. While this phenomenon reflects the international situation after the incident, the human factor is also an important element, as one might expect.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia is the center of the Little Entente and the backbone of the Balkan Pact. Since the tension between France and Germany increased, Germany has used commercial interests to entice Yugoslavia. If Germany's policy succeeds, it could break the alliance between France and the Little Entente and deepen the deterioration between Yugoslavia and Italy. At the same time, it could prevent the realization of Franco-Italian amity. Therefore, Yugoslavia is in a pivotal position. If it follows in Poland's footsteps and leans toward Germany, France will not only lose the support of the Little Entente, but the effectiveness of the Balkan Pact will also be undermined. Conversely, if Yugoslavia's relationship with France becomes closer, Germany will have to admit defeat. Its crucial importance is such that Barthou greatly valued its attitude.</p>
<p>However, judging from the recent mutual animosity between Italy, Yugoslavia, and Hungary, it is questionable whether these three countries can overcome their old grievances. A few days ago, Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös visited Austria and Italy. Although the content of his visits is unknown, it is undoubtedly aimed at Yugoslavia and seeks to extend the revisionist claims. If so, not only will Italian-Yugoslav and Yugoslav-Hungarian relations fail to improve, but the relationship between the Italy-Austria-Hungary group and the Little Entente will also be affected. If the relationship between the Italy-Austria-Hungary group and the Little Entente cannot be adjusted, Franco-Italian amity will also be impossible. According to a French telegraphic dispatch yesterday, French Foreign Minister Laval, when declaring his foreign policy, still emphasized the urgent need for Franco-Italian friendship, which can be said to be to the point. However, in our view, the key is still to resolve the old grievances between Italy, Yugoslavia, and Hungary. If this succeeds, Franco-Italian relations can be satisfactory. Otherwise, the situation in Central Europe will eventually offer Germany an opportunity to exploit.</p>
<h3>Manchurian Beans Exchanged for German Airships</h3>

<p>Plan to Migrate One Million People Within Ten Years</p>
<p>Tokyo - The military and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs plan to establish an immigration company to handle Manchurian immigration.

The immigration will begin in northern Manchuria to prepare for war against Russia, and then expand to the entire territory.

The Foreign Ministry has no knowledge of this. (Note: According to the Boxer Protocol, troops from England, the United States, France, Italy, and other countries are allowed to conduct exercises outside Shanhaiguan. The dispute between England and Japan has not been resolved. The British Foreign Secretary only declared to the House of Commons on November 4 that the British government had abandoned the practice of conducting exercises outside the Great Wall.)

<h3>Partial Reshuffle of the Spanish Cabinet</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Lerroux Concurrently Serves as Minister of the Army</p>
<p>Minister of the Navy Rocha Concurrently Serves as Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Madrid - Yesterday's session of the Chamber of Deputies was very turbulent. After the adjournment, rumors spread that a political crisis had erupted. After a reorganization by Prime Minister Lerroux today, the crisis was averted. The changes in cabinet members have been approved by President Zamora. Those who resigned included the Minister of the Army, Hidalgo, and the Foreign Minister, who was replaced by the Minister of the Navy, Rocha. This partial cabinet reshuffle has once again revealed the political power of the Catholic Party led by Llopart, which has a significant latent influence on the government and the majority party in Congress. The number of members of the Radical Party, headed by Prime Minister Lerroux, who are being absorbed by the Catholic Party is increasing. The reason why the Radical Party has not been eliminated entirely is due to Lerroux's personal prestige and the adherence of party members. Although the position of the current cabinet is more consolidated, it is not certain. Generally, people believe that important political events will occur in the near future.

<h3>Insisting on Naval Equality, Japan Rejects British Proposal</h3>
<p>England and the United States are Actually United in Maintaining Ratios</p>
<p>Davis Stays in London Awaiting Developments</p>
<p>London - The Japanese government has rejected the naval compromise proposal put forward by the British representatives last week. It is reported that the Japanese delegation received instructions from Tokyo last night regarding this proposal, stating that the Japanese government greatly appreciates the efforts of the British representatives, but generally rejects the overall recommendations contained in the British compromise proposal and reiterates Japan's demand for naval equality with England and the United States. The Japanese representatives informed the British Foreign Office of the content of the instructions today. The pre-budget representatives will continue to talk next week. (Reuters telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington - According to informal statements from the U.S. State Department and naval authorities today, the U.S. government's attitude towards any suggestion of recognizing Japanese naval equality remains very cold, even in principle. Officials still adhere to the original argument that the Washington and London Naval Treaties have already granted Japan defensive equality. The U.S. plan is to continue these treaties, and the naval ratio should not be changed. The State Department has received the full report from the U.S. naval negotiating representative, Davis, but the report does not contain any information about British Foreign Secretary Simon's request for Davis to consider the recent British counter-proposal and to recognize Japanese equality in principle, as reported in the newspapers. According to government officials today, if this request is made, the government will refuse it, regardless of whether the proposer is Foreign Secretary Simon. Observers today have been interpreting the British move to seek U.S. opinion on Anglo-American naval cooperation after the failure of the tripartite agreement. According to their conclusion, Britain does not expect Japan to accept its counter-proposal, because in reality, Britain opposes Japan's actual naval equality no less than the U.S., but wants the U.S. to bear the full responsibility for the rejection. The State Department announced today that given the current state of the naval talks, Davis will remain in London and will not go to Geneva to attend the main committee meeting on disarmament to be held on November 21. Wilson will attend instead. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>London - According to reliable sources here today, if Japan implements its intention to cancel the Washington Naval Treaty, the naval situation will likely have new developments. If Japan does so, England and the United States will continue their existing talks on a bilateral basis to prepare for a new treaty that is relevant to multilateral compromises. British and American representatives have already discussed this. If the tripartite talks fail, the proposals of England and the United States will be discussed by the world's naval powers at the naval conference next year. At that time, a convention may be produced that Japan can join at any time. Currently, Japan's reply to the British compromise plan has not yet arrived in London. It is reported that Japanese cabinet members are awaiting the Emperor's review of the army's annual exercises, which is why the reply has been delayed. (Reuters telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Instructions Arrive in England</h3>
<p>Japanese Delegation Meets Late at Night</p>
<p>London - The Japanese government's countermeasures to the British proposal arrived at the Japanese delegation on the afternoon of the 16th. The content seems to say that the British proposal is far from Japan's fundamental policy, and it is necessary to explain Japan's claims to the British side again. The Japanese delegation convened a meeting immediately after receiving the instructions and did not disperse until late at night. (Japan United News telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>London - The Japanese government's answer to the British naval proposals has been sent. There has been no change in its views on naval issues. It is generally believed that the Japanese reply still maintains the principles announced by the Japanese representative, Rear Admiral Yamamoto, when he arrived in London. Figures around the Japanese delegation claim that the Tokyo government is willing to work to avoid the failure of the naval talks, but generally, given Japan's previously expressed views, it is feared that there is no possibility of change. As such, the naval talks are now at an impasse, and it appears that it is up to the U.S. delegation to break the deadlock. Kato, a counselor at the Japanese Embassy, visited Craigie, a naval expert at the Foreign Office, this morning to inform him that the Japanese delegation had received a reply and requested that representatives from the UK and Japan be convened as soon as possible. However, Foreign Secretary Simon is not currently in London, and Craigie could not say when the representatives of the two countries would meet. Prime Minister MacDonald hosted the U.S. delegation for lunch at Chequers today. The Foreign Office reported by telephone that the Japanese reply had been sent. (Havas telegram, 17th)</p>

<p>The Tokyo government has decided to notify the abrogation of the Washington Treaty in early next month based on its established policy and is now preparing everything. At the same time, regardless of the success or failure of the London preparatory conference, it will issue a statement in the name of Foreign Minister Hirota, asserting roughly the following: The Imperial government does not hope that the abrogation of the Washington Treaty will lead to a treaty-less state or induce naval competition, etc. It is eager to conclude a treaty that can achieve genuine disarmament. This has been clearly expressed in the preparatory consultation, but regrettably, it has not been agreed to by the participating countries. However, it is convinced that the world, regardless of the success or failure of the participating countries' preparatory consultation, hopes to hold a formal meeting next year based on the provisions of Article 23 of the Washington Treaty to re-examine Japan's claims and review the adjustment of the new disarmament plan.

<h3>Talk of a Four-Power Agreement</h3>
<p>Franco-Italian Approach is Quite Difficult</p>
<p>London - The British government expects the Japanese delegation to begin negotiations with Britain to discuss compromise issues, but the Japanese delegation has not yet expressed any opinion. It is rumored that if the Japanese government rejects the British proposal, the UK, US, France, and Italy will enter into a disarmament agreement. It is obvious that the British government hopes that the four-power agreement will be established if it is rejected by Japan. However, the United States does not want Japan to fail to participate in the agreement, and there are various difficult problems in the agreement between Italy and France, so the four-power agreement seems to have no hope of being realized. The U.S. government has been targeting the Japanese navy to sign a treaty, explicitly stating that the agreement is limited to the ship types and other quality limitations of the four countries, and the United States absolutely cannot agree.

<h3>British Dominion Minister Strenuously Denies European War Rumors</h3>
<p>Mutual Suspicion Among Countries is Indeed a Factor in Causing War</p>
<p>Denies Entering into Any Secret Agreement with Other Countries</p>
<p>International Investigation of the Arms Trade is Welcomed</p>
<p>London - Overseas Territories Minister Thomas said in a speech at Newport in Monmouthshire today that rumors of war are rampant, but he feels that there is no reason for this. As far as the UK is concerned, the British government has never entered into any secret agreement with Europe, either directly or indirectly. The British government does face various difficulties, and overseas and Europe do have factors that create a spirit of war, such as suspicion and malice, but he sees no reason for the current rumors of war. Thomas went on to mention the arms trade issue, saying that he knows that some people are deeply worried about this issue, but the country that has strictly managed the export of arms by the government through licensing methods is the UK. To his knowledge, the UK has rejected arms orders worth millions of pounds for this reason in the past three years, while other countries have reaped the benefits. Because of what the UK has done, the UK will continue to not provide government assistance to arms manufacturing and exports. He very much hopes that other countries will follow suit. He would welcome any investigation into the true state of the arms trade, and he believes that the results would show that the UK has something to be proud of. (Reuters telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>Churchill's Alarming Rhetoric: Germany Teaches Its People to Fight</h3>
<p>England is in Danger of Being Bombed</p>
<p>There is a Need to Strengthen the Air Force</p>
<p>London - Churchill, a prominent British military writer and politician, delivered a radio address to the nation today, forcefully describing the danger of a German attack on England in vivid language. Churchill warned that there is a country that only needs a few hours to fly to England. Its population is about 70 million, all of whom are the best in the world. The education they have received since childhood is that war is glorious [dying on the battlefield is heavier than Mount Tai]. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>London - Former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill, of the extreme right wing, delivered a radio speech, vigorously stating the increasing danger of Germany. The main point of his conclusion was that [England should find a way to make its air force the strongest in Europe]. Churchill also said, [As Germany rises, shall we bow our heads in surrender? Otherwise, we must prepare to prevent it. The only way to avoid war is to make the forces maintaining all sides three or four times greater than the other side. Maintaining peace depends entirely on having superior power.] (Havas telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>German Internal Affairs Not Unified</h3>
<p>Estrangement between the National Defense Force and the Head of State Has Not Been Eliminated</p>
<p>Hague - According to a Dutch person who is familiar with the situation in Germany, although the German National Defense Force has sworn allegiance to Hitler personally after he assumed the position of head of state, there has always been some estrangement between the two sides. Since the National Socialist Party's purge on June 30, the Schutzstaffel has always existed, and the relationship between the National Defense Force and the Party Army is very tense. Some powerful figures have expressed hostility towards the nature of the National Socialist revolutionary movement, which was launched from the bottom, and hope to disband the Sturmabteilung directly. In addition, during the purge on June 30, former Chancellor General Schleicher was killed without a judicial trial, which is also unacceptable to military personnel. Some powerful leaders in the military firmly advocate that this case be submitted to a military court. It should be noted that Defense Minister General von Blomberg has been ill recently, and rumors about his condition are rife, and there is even talk that Blomberg has resigned. Although this news has been denied by the German semi-official news agency, it is by no means without cause. (Havas telegram, 16th)</p>

(Reuters telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>Rome - Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg came here to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini, and newspapers are commenting on it. The Stefani News Agency said that [Italian-Austrian relations are exceptionally strong, and diplomatic relations are very close, and there will never be any unexpected events]. Other newspapers said that the Austrian Prime Minister's visit is a continuation of Italian-Austrian friendship, but said that there is no increase in new factors for European politics. The Italian Daily said that [Italy is implementing a good neighbor policy based on the European spirit. Italy is not seeking any benefits for itself in Austria]. The Labor News of the Universal Labor Union refuted the arguments of a German newspaper, which said that the intimacy of relations between Rome, Vienna, and Budapest is an obstacle to Franco-Italian rapprochement. The Labor News replied that [German newspapers often say that since the tripartite agreements have been signed by Italy, Austria, and Hungary (referring to the agreement signed in Rome in March of this year), they cannot be compatible with France and the countries of the Little Entente, but cooperation between the two groups of countries is indeed possible. Can't the German newspapers think about it from this perspective? As we see it, a layer of cooperation between the two groups is of great interest.] (Havas telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>Five Hundred Boxes of Silver Shipped from China to the United States</h3>
<p>Still Profitable After Paying Export Tax</p>
<p>Rumors that the U.S. Will Increase Domestic Silver Prices</p>
<p>New York - Five hundred boxes of silver from China have recently arrived in the United States. This is the first batch to arrive after China implemented the silver export tax. The silver price here recently reached 55 cents per ounce, which is the highest market price since 1929. Therefore, it is still profitable to ship silver from China to the U.S., even after paying the tax rate. It is rumored that the government will greatly increase the price of purchasing domestically mined new silver, while reducing or even completely stopping the amount purchased from abroad. Although this news has been denied by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, rumors are growing. Senators from silver-producing states in the United States have expressed dissatisfaction with the poor implementation of the silver plan and may demand that the government take new measures. The government is likely trying to avoid this, so it intends to increase the domestic silver purchase price. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>

<h3>Final Judgments in the Japanese Showa Era's Three Major Scandals</h3>

<p>Tokyo, September of Showa 4 (1929), former Railway Minister Heikichi Ogawa, Chief of the Bureau of Decorations Naoyoshi Amaoka, and President of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry Kaneichi Fujita colluded.

<h3>Elections for the Indian Legislative Assembly</h3>
<p>Gandhi Urges Voters Not to Abandon Their Rights</p>
<p>New Delhi, with the release of the Indian Constitutional Reform Committee's report on Thursday, Indians, recognizing the importance of the report, are now competing in the Legislative Assembly elections.

The people are gradually realizing that they must work hard for reform. However, it is predictable that after the release of the committee's report, it will be severely criticized by the National Congress and other groups.

Chairman Chen was outraged by the absurdity of the content and immediately telegraphed the Wuxi County Government to strictly investigate the instigators, send them to the province for investigation, and send personnel to Wuxi to secretly investigate the truth. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Wuxi County Government received a provincial telegram to investigate the false advertisement published in a Shanghai newspaper, inciting opposition to land price declaration and disrupting public order. The falsely named Hua Yishan, Wang Jianru, Hou Shaoxian, Cai Yinji, Hu Dinglu, Xue Suijie, Mao Mujun, Gu Chunhu, and Wang Jishi officially submitted statements to the county government on the 16th.

<h3>The Truth About the Decayed Corpse Case in Beiping is Revealed</h3>
<p>Beiping, since the discovery of a decayed corpse outside Xuanwumen, there have been various rumors about its source. Last night, two people went to the Fourth District Police Station to claim the remains. They claimed that one person, Niu Fengji, was the deceased's nephew, and the other, Guo Fengjiang, was the deceased's cousin. The deceased's name was Liu Xianru, 54 years old, from Leling County, Shandong Province. He used to sell thread outside Gubeikou. He died of illness twenty years ago. At that time, the local authorities planned to transport the body back to his hometown, but they gave up due to lack of funds. Now that the body has decayed, they marked the limbs, packed them into sacks, and planned to transport them back to their hometown. At that time, they hired three rickshaws, but the rickshaw pullers had bad intentions and absconded with the remains. After investigation, it was discovered that they were remains, so they abandoned them outside Xuanwumen and fled. It was not until the next day that the rest of the party saw the report in the newspaper. After the court examined them, they confirmed that they were Niu's remains and dared to come and claim them. After questioning them, the details were reported to the Public Security Bureau for instructions. Niu Fengji and the other person are being temporarily detained in the district pending interrogation.

<h3>A Newspaper Discusses the European Crisis</h3>
<p>War is almost unavoidable. Osaka Asahi Shimbun's special envoy, Mr. Zhanqiang Song, wrote an article saying that the current European political situation is even gloomier than before the outbreak of the Great War in 1914. According to the predictions of diplomatic experts, the situation is bound to change. Since Russia joined the alliance, the international situation has changed greatly. Furthermore, the assassination of Yugoslav Emperor Alexander I and French Foreign Minister Barthou has made the resolution of old problems between France, Italy, and Yugoslavia temporarily illusory. The reactionary policies and new trends among the governments of the European continent are increasingly exposed. The advocacy of realists and idealists has triggered the most worrying Central European alliance among European politicians. However, this movement is still in the brewing stage. If the rapprochement between France and Italy is realized through the efforts of the late French Foreign Minister Barthou, then Italy will inevitably separate from Poland and Germany. From the Gulf of Finland to the Arctic Ocean, through the Black Sea, and from the North Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, it will bisect Central Europe vertically and complete its consolidated alliance. The purpose of this Central European alliance is to isolate the Russian-French alliance and split the small, weak Entente countries. Marshal Pilsudski's decisive policy has now been largely revealed, namely Poland's gradual approach to Germany. According to newspapers in Warsaw, under the accumulated system, it is forbidden to imitate the Xingguo Party. Now that France and Russia are approaching each other, and Germany and Poland are contacting each other, their interests are completely the same. However, among the triangular relationship, Italy, which is using Bari as the center to instigate the Balkan alliance, is extremely worried about France's expansion of power in the Mediterranean. At the same time, Italy cannot tolerate the Bolshevik politics of Soviet Russia. Regarding German-Polish policy, it still cannot forget the issue of Austria's merger in the past. Apart from these two issues, there are almost no other conflicting interests among the three major European powers. In other words, since the three powers have common interests, it is natural that they need to act together. At present, European countries have not yet clearly expressed their beneficial political intentions towards France under Doumergue's rule, and between Berlin, Warsaw, and Rome. Poland is particularly displeased with the Eastern Locarno Treaty jointly proposed by Russia and France, whose goal is to maintain the current state of its borders. The reason is that Poland can not only separate Ukraine from Russia, but also has the ambition to merge Lithuania. Therefore, Poland hopes for the collapse of Russia, and the reason is that it has a powerful neighbor adjacent to the east. At present, the Polish people believe that in the future, places such as Qiu Fuaotesa in Ukraine will inevitably be dominated by them. The reason is that although Marshal Pilsudski was a frequent visitor to Vilnius and the Port of Memel, he failed due to Kovno's opposition. Most of the residents of Lithuania are Polish. This issue of residents will inevitably cause a dispute in the future. The intention of German President Hitler's book "Mein Kampf" is that all adjacent countries where the Teutonic race is located will be Germanized. In other words, if you want to implement a greater Germany policy, you cannot abandon war. After Germany and Poland secretly signed the ten-year non-aggression agreement, Poland has recognized maintaining the status quo. However, Hitler knows very well that it is very dangerous to merge Austria at one time, so he remains neutral in the Italian-Austrian agreement, focusing all his efforts on the Saar issue and sending overtures to Poland in order to achieve the purpose of recovery. Germany has gradually become self-sufficient in military affairs. Poland is rich in natural resources. However, Italy feels quite lacking in economic power. Iron, steel, coal, etc. are all dependent on foreign countries. Therefore, German industry, Polish agriculture, and Italy's Mediterranean exports will have a significant relationship in economic and military terms when a second world war breaks out in the future. In the countries of the Baltic Sea, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, part of Czechoslovakia, and the area from Austria to the Baltic and Black Sea, the population is as high as 100 million, but none of them are industrialized countries. Therefore, the region regards the products of Germany, Italy, Austria, and the semi-industrialized Czechoslovakia as excellent markets, and agricultural products as exchange commodities. Both parties have mutual relations. Such a large population can be united to form a unit, of which Germany and Italy account for two-thirds. Czechoslovakia has more than three million German-speaking people. Even if it is later controlled by Yugoslavia, it cannot be arbitrarily independent. Romania sympathizes with Germany and opposes Russia because of the Bessarabia issue. As a member of the Bulgarian-Hungarian alliance, it has a rebellious trend against the joint instigation of Germany and Italy. Therefore, even in military terms, if Poland, Germany, and Italy are linked together, their power must be formidable. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has worked hard on building a powerful military in the past ten years. Germany has also made full preparations since it rejected the military restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. Poland has a standing army of 250,000, and four-tenths of its annual budget is spent on military expenses. Marshal Pilsudski has the power to temporarily declare martial law. In addition, all able-bodied men in Poland from the age of sixteen to sixty, and women from the age of nineteen to forty-five, can be enlisted. School training enforces military education. At present, about one hundred thousand students have received three years of preliminary military education. This year, there are 500,000 unemployed people, and the government has incorporated them into military camps to provide relief. According to reliable sources, Hitler sent a secret envoy to Rome to secretly discuss with Italy and inquire about France's opinions. Unfortunately, Foreign Minister Barthou passed away, which led to the failure of the policy. On the one hand, Italy showed goodwill to Germany. On the other hand, France had to restore its previous relationship with the small Entente countries and sought more understanding with Romania, Czechoslovakia, Belgrade, and Rome. Under this complex international situation, various countries are eyeing each other covetously, all wanting to get what they want. The crisis of war is imminent.</p>
<h3>The Annual Meeting of the Chinese Hydraulic Engineering Society Was Held in Zhenjiang Yesterday</h3>
<p>Li Yishe served as the chairman of the conference and delivered the opening speech</p>
<p>In the afternoon, sightseeing, in the evening, discussion of proposals</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Newsletter: The Chinese Hydraulic Engineering Society held its fourth annual meeting at Dinghui Temple on Jiaoshan Mountain in Zhenjiang yesterday (17th). Forty-seven members and nineteen representatives of member organizations attended. The opening ceremony was held in the morning, sightseeing in the afternoon, and proposals were discussed in the evening. At the opening ceremony, Li Yishe, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, served as the chairman of the conference and delivered the opening speech. Zhang Zili, the General Secretary, reported on the Society's affairs, and Shen Baixian, the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, reported on the preparations. Members Shi Xiafeng and organization representatives Zheng Quanbo, Peng Jiqun, and Gao Tingzi delivered speeches. The meeting was adjourned at 12:00 PM for a group photo. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>List of Members The names of the members who attended yesterday are as follows: Xiao Kaide, Xu Qishu, Gu Shiji, Shen Binzhang, Shen Baixian, Lin Baoyuan, Wu Minghou, Liu Zhongwei, Huang Qingxian, Lei Hongquan, Sun Fushi, Chen Zhan'en, Zhang Zili, Yang Baopu, Peng Jiqun, Li Shutian, Wang Chaozhen, Chen Maojie, Zhou Shang, Li Kuan, Zhu Shijun, Hu Yingyuan, Zhu Yong, Zhang Hanying, Zheng Zhaojing, Dai Gongkui, Chen Ruzhen, Hong Shen, Kong Lingrong, Xu Kailin Rong, Xiang Zhu Yanping, Sun Liang, Liu Han, Xu Xinwu, Huang Yan, Ge Hanlou, Xu Nankou, Cong Yongwen, Li Yishe, Wu Tongju, Gao Yanzhi, Ma Yuqi, Song Xishang, Xu Zhichan, etc., and more than fifty representatives of groups.</p>
<p>Opening Speech After the ceremony, Chairman Li Yishe delivered the opening speech, which briefly stated that today is the fourth annual meeting, and it is being held at Jiaoshan Mountain, which is famous throughout the country. The weather is so good, and so many friends have come to the meeting, which is really gratifying. The Society has been established for four years, and in these four years, thanks to the efforts of our members and the government's special attention to water conservancy, the progress of water conservancy has been unprecedented, which is also gratifying. We are holding a meeting in this scenic country, which makes us feel the great significance. Our country attaches great importance to the two words "mountains and rivers." For example, "mountains and rivers" can represent the name of the country. Now the mountains and rivers are almost broken, which really makes us feel very emotional. We want to revive the mountains and rivers, and all the compatriots in the country should be responsible, especially the water conservancy circles. Everyone's revival of the mountains and rivers cannot be made up for by empty words. We must practice it ourselves, and then we can resist foreign insults. Now the national defense is empty, the people are suffering, and production is weak, mostly because water conservancy is not prosperous. To enrich production, water conservancy is the biggest problem. Now the country is actively promoting water conservancy plans, but at the same time, it is also considering two difficulties, namely, talent and economic issues. We hope that the members of the Society will resolve this issue as soon as possible. Hereafter, I hope to pay attention to a few points. First, I hope to contribute more academically to the Society in the future. Second, I hope that members will show a spirit of not fearing difficulties in the future to save the country from its crisis. Third, I hope that members will report on their own work once a year so that everyone can know and encourage each other, etc.</p>
<p>Reporting on Society Affairs The General Secretary, Zhang, stood up and reported on the progress of the Society's affairs over the past year, as well as the income and expenditure situation.

Afterwards, members Wu Xiafeng, Zheng Quanbo, the representative of the National Economic Committee, Peng Jiqun, the representative of the North China Water Conservancy Committee, and Gao Tingzi, the representative of the Ministry of Communications, delivered speeches in succession. When they were finished, it was noon, so the meeting was adjourned for lunch and the discussion of proposals was postponed to the evening.</p>

<h3>Cao Zhiqi, Standing Committee Member of the Tunxi Chamber of Commerce, Was Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Obstructing the construction of bunkers and profiting from it</p>
<p>The sentence was executed and part of his property was confiscated</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Wang Qiupu, chairman of the Tunxi Town Chamber of Commerce in southern Anhui, and Cao Zhiqi, a standing committee member, were previously accused and arrested by the Tunxi Public Security Bureau. They were transferred by the Tenth District Administrative Inspector. Public Office. The guards escorted them to the province. The provincial government handed them over to the Huaining County Government for temporary custody. Recently, Liu Zhenhua, the chairman of the small government and concurrently the commander of the provincial security forces, stationed in Tunxi to supervise the suppression of the remnants of bandits in southern Anhui. He carefully investigated the case and believed that Cao's crime was unforgivable. Therefore, he telegraphed the provincial government to order Xu Pengyun, commander of the Anqing Garrison, to send a team to take the prisoner Cao Zhiqi from the Huaining County Government to the execution ground outside the Shuidongmen at 10:00 AM yesterday (16th) and execute him by firing squad. Cao was 37 years old, from Qingyang County, and was wealthy. He held considerable influence in the Tunxi business community and served as the chairman of the town's chamber of commerce. When the execution was carried out, he was still dressed in luxurious clothes. For a time, the number of viewers was endless. Then, Cao's body was prepared by his family members and placed in a coffin for burial. It is reported that Wang Qiutuan, who was involved in the same case, is still detained by the Huaining County Government due to his lighter circumstances and will be dealt with separately. Cao Zhiqi's crimes are recorded below: [Case report from the Anhui Provincial Government's Secret Order No. 178: Recently, a telegram from Tunxi's administrative office reported that Cao Zhiqi, who was detained in Huaining, served as a standing committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, and assigned people to fight verbal battles and embezzle public funds, amounting to tens of thousands. He relied on his power and bullied the people, colluding with gangs and bandits, causing public resentment. He smoked strong drugs and sold red pills. During the recent intrusion of the Red bandits, Cao Zhiqi dared to obstruct the construction of bunkers in the spring, and then took the opportunity to profit from the valuation of the bunkers, amounting to more than 3,000 yuan.

<h3>The Police Station Turns Over Arrested Persons to the Garrison Department</h3>
<p>Yan Youzhang, a special agent of the county's Public Security Bureau, led police officers Xia Dehua, etc., to search for illicit soil at Yangxuan in the western train station front area the night before last. They chased the soil peddlers to the platform. The soil transporters shouted for help. Railway police and military police came out to inquire upon hearing the alarm. The military police office woke Yan Youzhang to view the official document symbol, but he replied that he had not brought it with him. Then, the military police left Wu Tielin, who was carrying the soil, and a load of soil for verification. According to the military police office, they recently received instructions from the Executive Yuan that if local police need to perform their duties within the station platform area, they must first consult with the railway police. This time, the special agent of the bureau did not follow the formal procedures for checking soil, so it is difficult to condone. Therefore, the anti-narcotics commission has repeatedly sent people to negotiate. The military police office has submitted a request to the military police regiment headquarters for instructions. Upon receiving the instructions, they ordered that the soil peddler Wu Tielin and 18.5 jin of illicit soil be transferred to the Shanghai Garrison Command for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Vagrants Damage Xiangzhen Automobiles</h3>
<p>The Xiangzhen Automobile Company operates cars between Nanxiang and Shanghai to transport passengers, and the business is very good. The vagrants in Nanxiang extorted protection money from the company, but the company ignored them. On the morning of the 15th, the vagrants gathered eight or nine people, armed with axes, chisels, and other sharp weapons, and ambushed south of Guyi Garden in Dongshi. Two of the company's cars carrying passengers came from Shanghai. They stepped forward to stop them, and used axes and chisels to attack the cars. After a period of time, the two cars were damaged and could not drive. The passengers had to get out of the cars and walk. The vagrants also fled in different directions. Zhang Shougao, the manager of the company, heard the news and immediately dispatched more than 30 people from Shanghai in five cars to show force. The situation was serious for a while. Cao Hanqing, the patrol officer of the public security outpost in the town, reported the news and was afraid that the matter would escalate. He ordered more than ten people from the car company to come to the office and ordered them to return to Shanghai. All the damage to the car will be investigated. At that time, Fan Chunsan, a shop assistant from the town's opium shop (who shot and injured Ma Likang and Shen Xingchun in the crowd during the dragon boat race), went to watch the excitement. He was identified by a driver of the company as having participated in the damage to the car. Officer Cao took Fan and the driver to the city for interrogation, and after a purchase of waves, the situation was finally quelled.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Flying from Qingdao by Condor Plane</p>
<p>Inspecting Supervision Sites En Route via Haizhou</p>
<p>North China's Financial Revenue and Expenditure Offset</p>
<p>According to Central News Agency, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, at the invitation of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, inspected various agencies under the Ministry of Finance in Shanxi and has completed his official duties. Accompanied by Chairman Chiang's wife, Ms. Soong Mei-ling, he toured scenic spots via Jinan and Qingdao. Yesterday morning at around 8:00, he returned to Shanghai from Qingdao on his own Condor plane. At 11:15, he arrived at Hongqiao Airport and went directly to his private residence to rest. He then received reporters from various newspapers at his residence, discussing the details of his trip. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Departing from Qingdao at 8:00</p>
<p>At 8:08 yesterday morning, Mr. Kong, accompanied by Chairman Chiang's wife, Ms. Soong Mei-ling, and a female nurse, a party of six, flew from Qingdao Airport to Shanghai on Mr. Kong's own Condor plane. At 9:20, they arrived in Haizhou, where they stopped briefly to inspect the supervision fields. They then took the original plane to Shanghai, arriving at Hongqiao Airport at 11:15. After disembarking, they changed to their own car and returned to their private residence on West Avenue at 11:45 to rest.</p>
<p>Various Circles Arrive to Welcome</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank notified Kong's residence to prepare a car to welcome him after receiving a telegram from Qingdao yesterday morning informing them of Kong's arrival in Shanghai. Ms. Soong Ai-ling, wife of Kong, Li Qingxuan, Counselor of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance, and Li Jingyao and Tan Guang, secretaries of the Central Bank, went to Hongqiao Airport to welcome him at around 11:00. Yang Hu, Director of the Municipal Security Department, and Wang Zhijing, Secretary, personally led the security team to the scene to guard the perimeter. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also rushed armed police officers to the scene to provide protection after receiving temporary information. After Mr. Kong and Mrs. Chiang got off the car, they shook hands with the welcoming personnel one by one. Yang Hu, Director of the Municipal Security Department, personally escorted Mr. Kong and others back to their residence before departing.</p>
<p>Kong Talks About His Trip North</p>
<p>Mr. Kong received reporters at his residence yesterday afternoon. According to him, he had long planned to travel north to inspect the financial situation in North China and the Yellow River water conservancy project. However, due to busy government affairs, he had been delayed. When Chairman Chiang set off north, he also sent a telegram inviting him to go along, but he was unable to find the time. Later, he learned that Chairman Chiang was scheduled to go to Shanxi on the 8th for inspection, so he flew to Shanxi from Nanjing on the 7th to assist the Shanxi authorities in hosting him in order to fulfill local hospitality. After Chairman Chiang returned from southern Shanxi, Chairman Huang of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Yu of Hebei Province, Chairman Song of Chahar Province, and Chairman Fu of Suiyuan Province all sent telegrams inviting him to meet. He then went to Beiping to meet with Chairman Huang and the three Chairmen Yu, Song, and Fu. He then went to Tianjin to inspect the water conservancy project, and then went to Jinan to meet Chairman Han. Since he had been away from Qingdao for ten years, he made a detour to inspect it. Today, he returned to Shanghai from Qingdao, passing through Haizhou to inspect the Hujian farm. This is the process of going north.</p>
<p>North China's Finances Offset Each Other</p>
<p>The current revenue and expenditure of the finances of the provinces in North China can offset each other. The Shanxi Provincial Government has abolished approximately 500,000 in miscellaneous taxes, and the county governments have abolished more than 5,700,000. Together with various unnamed levies, the people can reduce a total burden of more than 14 million. The provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan currently directly remit national taxes to the central government. As for the subsidy to the Beiping Military Branch, it is borne by the central government. The financial situation has entered the right track. The revenue and expenditure of Hebei Province can also be suitable. Under the chairmanship of Chairman Han, the revenue and expenditure of Shandong Province can be offset each year, and many miscellaneous taxes have also been abolished.</p>
<p>Progress in Qingdao City Construction</p>
<p>I followed the President north through Qingdao in the 13th year of the Republic of China, and it has been ten years. This time, when I revisit Qingdao City, I deeply feel that Qingdao City has made a lot of progress. Mayor Shen has strived to improve education, health, and politics in Qingdao City, which is especially praised by Chinese and foreign people. The recently established civilian housing has more than 12 districts, with complete facilities and extremely cheap rent, benefiting the common people, which is really not shallow.</p>
<p>Returning to Nanjing Next Monday</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang inspected the Northwest and North China this time and promoted the New Life Movement, which the people have been quite influenced by. Mrs. Chiang is tired from the journey, so she will return to Shanghai with him to rest. The two Mongolian kings, Yun and De, intend to go to Nanjing to communicate opinions on the border areas. I will take the night train back to Nanjing next Monday to attend the Executive Yuan meeting.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Initiates Fundraising for Disaster Relief in Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>To Convene People from All Walks of Life for Discussion in the Coming Days</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the national army captured Ruijin, the bandit areas in southern Jiangxi have been recovered one after another. However, the area has been occupied by bandits for many years, with refugees all over the place, and homes reduced to ruins. Hundreds of thousands of victims are without food or clothing, and epidemics are prevalent, with a lack of medicine and doctors. The Jiangxi authorities and local people have sent letters and telegrams calling for relief. Mayor Wu, in view of the helplessness of the victims, decided to convene people from all walks of life in the coming days to discuss fundraising and find ways to transport medical supplies, cotton clothing, and doctors. Only elementary medical personnel are needed, and only medicines for malaria and smallpox are needed. Cotton clothing, regardless of size, new or old, is needed in large quantities, and the quality does not matter. There is no shortage of philanthropists in this city, who will surely do their best to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Shi Ziquan Leaves for Japan Yesterday</h3>

<p>Tan Zhen Has Completed His Investigation in Europe and Will Arrive in Shanghai the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Shi Ziquan, Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, was assigned to go to Japan to investigate the country's judicial system for reference.

<h3>Ma Chaojun Talks About the Crime of Adultery in Criminal Law</h3>
<p>The Central Political Council Has Decided on the Principle to Submit for Reconsideration</p>
<p>Adultery Is Entirely a Private Moral Issue</p>
<p>Legislators Ma Chaojun and Fu Bingchang, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tang Youren, and others, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing by car at 7:25 yesterday morning. A reporter from the Xinmin News Agency interviewed Mr. Ma at the Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Center yesterday. According to him, the Legislative Yuan passed the amendment to Article 239 of the Criminal Law, [A married woman who commits adultery with someone shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than one year, and the adulterer shall be treated the same]. Now, because women's circles have expressed opposition, the Central Political Council has decided that, in accordance with the principle of equality between men and women, it should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. After the Central Political Council submits the resolution, the Legislative Yuan will transfer it to the Criminal Law Review Committee for review and amendment, and then submit it to the Legislative Assembly for reconsideration. However, the crime of adultery has been stipulated in the current Criminal Law passed in 1927, and it is not a new stipulation. Eleven countries, including France and Japan, have stipulated it. The Legislative Yuan only made amendments based on the general situation in the country this time. Now that women's circles have expressed opposition, the Legislative Yuan will follow the principles set by the Central Political Council and submit it to the General Assembly for reconsideration. My opinion is that, in order to seek equality between men and women, efforts should be devoted to the political aspect. The matter of adultery is originally a private moral issue. The difference between the Criminal Law Amendment and the original provisions before the amendment is due to the different legal views of the legislators. In fact, there is no disagreement. As for the age of rape, the Legislative Yuan has passed an amendment in Article 221, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, [Carnal knowledge of a woman under the age of 14 shall be treated as rape, and it seems that it will not be reconsidered], he said.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Manila Donate a Large Amount of Relief Rice to Help Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross received a donation of 300 bags of local rice from Mr. Yang Zhongqing, an overseas Chinese in Manila, designated to relieve disaster areas such as Lin'an, Zhejiang. The original letter is quoted as follows: [To the Chinese Red Cross, I have long admired your association's compassion and humanitarian spirit, and you have the virtue of saving the world. Disaster victims have repeatedly received relief, which is greatly admired. My sons Yingmei and both received letters from Mr. Cai Xianzhang from Nanjing, detailing the drought in Zhejiang Province, and relief is urgently needed. I am eager to donate. I am not presumptuous, but I only seek to be the same as those who do good and help others. Therefore, I first shipped 300 bags of local rice on the Shuichuan ship and entrusted it to your association for proper receipt and transfer to Mr. Cai Xianzhang for distribution to the disaster victims. If Mr. Cai has left Nanjing to take up his post as Consul General in Yangon when the rice arrives, please distribute it to the disaster areas designated by Mr. Cai. Of these 300 bags of rice, two-thirds should be sent to the Lin'an County Government of Zhejiang for distribution, and one-third should be sent to Mr. Zhang Zhongkai in Nanxun Town, Wuxing County, Zhejiang, for transfer and distribution to the villagers in Jifang and Jicun on the edge of Taihu Lake. This meager effort is only to express my personal small intention. I wish you all the best. Sincerely, Yang Zhongqing].

<h3>Huang Shaoxiong and Others Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong, Chen Shaokuan, and Tang Youren arrived in Shanghai this morning on the night express train from Beijing.</p>
<h3>Ten Organizations Welcomed Song Faxiang Yesterday</h3>
<p>Song Discusses Strategies for Promoting Chinese Goods in Southeast Asia</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, the China General Federation of Industry, the Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, the Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Federation, the China International Trade Association, the China Producers and Merchants Federation, the China National Goods Co., Ltd., and the China National Goods Production and Sales Company, and other ten organizations welcomed Song Faxiang, the Consul General in Batavia, last night. In addition to Consul General Song, those present included Lin Kanghou, Wang Xingyi, Guo Shun, Hu Xichen, Fan Yangyao, Zhu Boyuan, Gu Huaibing, Xiang Kangyuan, Wu Yun Chu, and Zhang Zilian. Lin Kanghou presided over the meeting. The Chairman's welcoming speech and Consul General Song's speech are as follows:</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou's Welcoming Speech</p>
<p>Today, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai industrial and commercial organizations, and eleven national goods companies welcome Consul General Song, and have prepared a cup of wine to welcome Consul General Song. We are extremely honored to have Consul General Song grace us with his presence. Consul General Song has been stationed in Batavia for more than three years and is extremely familiar with the situation of the overseas Chinese. He has maintained the overseas Chinese, and his political reputation is widely praised. This autumn, the various Chinese Chambers of Commerce in the Dutch East Indies held a meeting in Batavia and established the Federation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce in the Dutch East Indies, and specially appointed Consul General Song as honorary chairman. This is enough to show Consul General Song's harmonious relationship with the overseas Chinese. This time, Consul General Song returned to China on official business, and the Federation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce in the Dutch East Indies specifically informed the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce in advance, taking advantage of Consul General Song's return to China, to invite domestic national goods business circles to discuss the promotion of national goods in the Dutch East Indies market, which is also enough to show Consul General Song's concern for the motherland. Our country is based on agriculture, and its industry is backward. Since the opening of trade with various countries in the world, it has imported more industrial products and exported more raw materials. Except for raw materials such as silk, hemp, tea, and livestock, miscellaneous grains, etc., very few industrial products are exported to Europe and the United States. The only outlet for our country's industrial products is Southeast Asia. In recent years, Southeast Asia has been affected by the global economic recession, and the sales of national goods in Southeast Asia have been greatly affected. In addition, Japan's recent active progress in Southeast Asia has caused national goods to fall sharply. If we do not quickly find a way to recover, then in the future, the Southeast Asian market, our country's goods will disappear. The Dutch East Indies has jurisdiction over Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes, etc., accounting for almost half of Southeast Asia. There are more than 30 Chinese Chambers of Commerce organized by overseas Chinese, which jointly formed the Federation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce in the Dutch East Indies. Consul General Song is the honorary chairman of the association and is so enthusiastic and concerned about national goods, which is very fortunate for the future of our national goods. I hope that you will not engage in empty talk, but consult with Consul Song on all practical methods, actively move forward, and catch up quickly, so that our national goods can still gain a foothold in the Southeast Asian market. I would like to propose a toast to Consul General Song and wish him success.</p>

<p>Song Faxiang's Reply</p>
<p>Mr. Song said in his reply, "I returned to China a few days ago to attend the Fifth National Congress. When I came, I was entrusted by the United Chinese Chambers of Commerce of the Dutch East Indies to contact manufacturers in China regarding the promotion of Chinese goods in Nanyang. As the Fifth National Congress was postponed, I first went to North China, traveling through places like Tianjin, Qingdao, etc. Today, I came to Shanghai and am honored by your welcoming meeting, which demonstrates your enthusiasm for national goods and your kindness towards me. I believe that promoting our country's goods in the Nanyang market is indeed an urgent matter for commerce. This matter has significant implications for your individual interests and our country's future. Firstly, in the current global economic crisis, our country's industry and commerce are particularly depressed. If we want to survive and avoid bankruptcy in the future, we must muster all our energy and open up a new path. Secondly, all the powerful countries in the world today are prosperous because of the development of industry and commerce. If we do not develop industry and commerce, our country will never become rich and strong. Thirdly, the competition in currencies is intensifying in the world. The amount of our country's import surplus each year is alarming. As a result, our gold and silver are completely flowing out, causing our finances to be depleted. If we want to fundamentally remedy this, we must increase export trade. Otherwise, no artificial method can preserve our silver and maintain our finances. Fourthly, some people say that our national goods are not yet self-sufficient, so how can we talk about promoting them overseas? They do not realize that in today's world, transportation is developed and has become a complete economic unit. No country can close itself off. If we want our industry to develop, we must expand the Guangdong market. The more we do not expand to the outside world, the less we can develop internally. Therefore, we must not hold the mistaken belief that we should first achieve self-sufficiency and then export. From the above four points, we can see that promoting national goods overseas is extremely important, and in the Nanyang region, it is not only necessary, but also possible. It is not only possible, but also very promising. Firstly, our industry is backward, and the quality of our goods is relatively poor. People in Europe and America are accustomed to using exquisite products, so our country's products are naturally not very suitable. However, in the Nanyang area, most of the residents are natives with a lower standard of living. They only need goods to be cheap. Even if the quality is slightly rough, it is not a big problem. Secondly, in terms of geography, our country is in an absolutely advantageous position. Europe and America are out of the question, and even Japan's industrial center is not as close as our country. Thirdly, there are many overseas Chinese in the Nanyang area. In the Dutch East Indies alone, there are more than one million people, far more than Europeans or Japanese. Moreover, overseas Chinese have great influence in commerce and have a strong patriotic heart. As long as there are national goods to sell, they will all make efforts. Fourthly, our overseas Chinese businessmen have gradually formed large-scale organizations and have even formed the United Chinese Chambers of Commerce, so the promotion of national goods will be easier in the future. From the above four points, we can see that promoting national goods in Nanyang is not only necessary, but also possible. As long as you all make efforts, the future is limitless. As for the specific methods of practical implementation, I would like to briefly state them to you. My personal heart and the local overseas Chinese's hearts to love the country and love their compatriots will not lag behind others. In the future, I will be sincere to help you at any time. The so-called Nanyang Islands generally refer to Siam, French Annam, the American Philippines, British Malaya, Borneo, and the Dutch East Indies. These places all have their own special circumstances and cannot be lumped together. It is a mistake to think that the Nanyang Islands are a whole market. Just talking about the Dutch East Indies, there are four large islands and more than ten small islands. Its area is as large as the four provinces of Hebei, Henan, Anhui, and Shandong combined. It has a population of more than 63 million, of which natives account for 97%, Chinese account for 1.7%, and Europeans (including the Dutch) account for 0.2%. There are only about 8,000 Japanese, which is not proportional. In terms of assets, the 1933 Dutch East Indies government income tax (LOCOME TAT) report shows that a total of 4.8 million guilders were collected, of which 52% came from Chinese. Considering the proportion of Chinese in the population, they pay such a high tax, which shows the economic status of the Chinese. Geographically, the Dutch East Indies is on the equator, and the four seasons are like summer and autumn in our country. There is no distinction between cold and hot, and there is no need to change items according to the season. This is very obvious. With the above simple background, let us look at the issue of promoting national goods. The Dutch East Indies islands are places where basic raw materials are produced, such as oil, tin, tea, sugar, rubber, coffee, etc. If the goods are cheap and suitable, they can be sold in this market. The reason why national goods cannot be sold well is because of other reasons. Generally, manufacturers who want to engage in export trade must have a larger capital scale. Our country's manufacturers are very small in scale, so they cannot take advantage of the benefits of large-scale economies. They also lack perfect organizations. There are more and more of these small manufacturers in recent years, and the competition in the domestic market is becoming more and more fierce. Profits are thin and exhausted. If this continues, there will be no way out. We cannot fail to have a deep understanding of this situation. Our country's international trade has had an alarming import surplus in recent years. Coupled with the global economic crisis, it is even more difficult for our country to maintain itself. Our business community has a great responsibility to solve this problem. Our approach is not only to promote national goods domestically, but also to promote them abroad. Only by actively engaging in export trade can the imbalance in our international trade be resolved. This is the second point we should recognize. Our country's banks have always charged high interest rates on loans. For example, Japanese importers in the Dutch East Indies borrow money from banks at a maximum interest rate of 5 or 6 per week. The interest rates for British and American businesses are even lower. Our country's banks charge one or two times higher. At the same time, because our banks are small in scale, they cannot lend for too long to avoid illiquidity. This situation imposes a great burden on our export manufacturers in an invisible way. Because of this burden, our manufacturers have to agree to conditions that are not conducive to the development of sales with agents or underwriters. In this way, national goods cannot compete in the market. This is the third point we should recognize. Domestic manufacturers are very backward in advertising and promotion in the Dutch East Indies. This one shortcoming will cause us to lose the existing minimal position of national goods in the Dutch East Indies in the future. Some manufacturers not only do not advertise, but they are also unwilling to register their own trademarks locally. Since the agents or underwriters do not receive advertising subsidies from the manufacturers, once the goods sell well, they will be counterfeited by others. This problem is very serious in the Dutch East Indies. This is the fourth point that cannot be ignored when discussing the promotion of national goods. Furthermore, what we should recognize is our business position. As the saying goes, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated." This saying is really good. The Dutch East Indies market has special circumstances, which will be explained in detail below. However, the biggest problem with our manufacturers is that they often do not have a corresponding understanding of export trade procedures, shipping costs, and the prices at which their goods compete with other people's goods locally. Either the agent's price is too high, or the packaging of the goods does not match the psychology of the local market. We must know that if we plan to promote national goods in the Dutch East Indies, we must cater to local needs. On the one hand, the quality must be improved to compete with others. On the other hand, the packaging must be changed to cater to the psychology of the market. This is the fifth point we must recognize. In this situation, we must have a systematic study of our plan to promote national goods to the Dutch East Indies. If we ignore it again, I am afraid that we will not be able to clean up the mess in the near future. Because domestic manufacturers are all relatively small in scale, the only appropriate method is for everyone to unite and compete with foreigners together. This kind of organization cannot be limited to spiritual unity, but must also be practical union, organizing sales companies. It is said that dozens of manufacturers in Shanghai have united to promote national goods to Nanyang. This is indeed the most appropriate basic principle, because firstly, our manufacturers can reduce competition in the domestic market, and secondly, it can help with the imbalance in our international trade. Both the country and ourselves will benefit. In recent years, the Japanese have been dumping goods in Nanyang as much as possible, and European and American and overseas Chinese businesses have been largely taken over by them. The Dutch East Indies government has therefore issued import restrictions to protect the overseas Chinese businesses. Otherwise, they will be completely wiped out in a few years. Many people in the country do not understand this provision, so they have misunderstandings. The Consulate General is located in the Dutch East Indies, so of course it cannot abandon its responsibility. It always seeks equal treatment and believes that the Dutch East Indies government will never be detrimental to us alone. In terms of feelings, the relationship between China and the Netherlands is very good. In terms of politics, there is absolutely no obstacle to the promotion of national goods. Moreover, now that the United Chinese Chambers of Commerce of the Dutch East Indies has been established, if domestic manufacturers also have a corresponding union in the future, the two sides will be able to help each other very easily. This is also one of my major missions in returning to China, and it is also a very necessary path in the process of promoting national goods. I have talked about the importance of competition above, so banks cannot fail to provide considerable assistance in the plan to promote national goods. Past history tells us that the most powerful means of foreign merchants now is to give long-term credit. As far as I know, some Japanese merchants give credit for as long as five or six months. Our importers cannot have the same competition because bank interest rates are too high. In these depressed times, without the help of banks, the promotion of national goods cannot succeed. The Dutch East Indies market is clearly divided into three levels. The upper-class market is mostly Europeans and Americans and wealthy overseas Chinese. They have a very bad perception of national goods and cannot be changed. However, there are not many of these people. Just now we also talked about that 90% of the entire Dutch East Indies are natives and Chinese, so the middle and lower-class markets are the most important. The middle-class market is mostly Chinese and wealthy natives. The reason why national goods can be promoted a little now is because of the promotion of these Chinese. The natives in the lower-level market are completely swayed by prices. If we want to promote national goods, we must reduce costs and lower prices. We absolutely do not believe that national goods cannot compete with Japanese goods, especially now that the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies have a very strong sense of the motherland. It is enough to take advantage of the current opportunity to restore the honor of national goods and remedy the obstacles to promotion. However, it is absolutely not possible to take advantage of the patriotism of the overseas Chinese to make excessive profits. This is the fourth principle in our plan. Regarding publicity, our plan is that there should be preliminary sacrifices. The distribution and display of samples should be imitated from others. According to the customs of the Dutch East Indies, several large cities hold night markets for two or three weeks every year, mostly in the form of exhibitions. European and American factories all participate, but our country's factories are mostly unwilling to spend money. However, if there is a united organization, many factories will participate together, and the cost will naturally be smaller, which is also the most appropriate. In summary, the principles of the plan to promote national goods to the Dutch East Indies are no more than the above five items: 1. Unite organization, 2. Cooperate with the United Chinese Chambers of Commerce of the Dutch East Indies, 3. Contact banks for assistance, 4. Research ways to reduce costs and attack the middle and lower-level markets, 5. United publicity. This time I returned to China, I was entrusted by the Dutch East Indies Chamber of Commerce to contact the domestic Chamber of Commerce in order to promote national goods. I was first met by the resident in Batavia. In the future, if there is a place to serve, please send letters and notices as much as possible. No one can refuse to promote national goods and revitalize our country's industry. Of course, I will do my best to work together with you.</p>
<h3>The International Problems Research Association Publicly Banquets American Garfield</h3>
<p>Lectures on the Work of the International Academy</p>
<p>Discusses Naval Reduction and the Far East Question</p>
<p>Dr. Garfield, son of the late American President, who served as President of Williams College for thirty years and is also the founder of the International Political Academy, recently arrived in Shanghai with his family. The International Problems Research Association specially held a banquet at the Bank Club the night before last (the 16th) to welcome him. The attendees included directors Guo Bingwen, Cao Yunxiang, Liu Zhanen, Li Zhaoxiang, Chen Liting, and members He Dekui, Wang Zhengxu, Gao Dajing, Mei Qiju, Tu Chuyu, etc., and also invited American Judge Helmholtz and his wife, Customs Inspector Keer and his wife, and others to accompany them. In addition, several members of the Pacific Association also participated. Chairman Guo Bingwen first asked Liu Zhanen to deliver a welcome speech, followed by Mr. Garfield who lectured on the history and work of the International Academy. Mr. Garfield briefly stated that before the European War, he already felt that American people did not understand the international situation. He wanted to organize an international academy, intending to take advantage of the summer vacation at Williams College to invite scholars from all over the world to give lectures at the academy for research purposes. Fortunately, he obtained generous donations from the chairman of the school's board of directors to try it out for three years. Later, it was suspended due to the war. It was not until 1912 that he gathered various scholars together to discuss the most important international issues of the time in plenary sessions, roundtable discussions, or personal talks. Although many diplomats from various countries attended, their remarks were all of a research nature and did not bear political responsibility. Moreover, personal talks were not made public, so various issues could be freely discussed in order to seek solutions. Therefore, it made a considerable contribution to practice. When the three-year trial period expired, the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations enthusiastically sponsored it, so the academy can still continue to work every year to this day. He hopes that this will enable a precise study of various international issues, seek mutual understanding among mankind, and lay the foundation for world peace, etc. After Mr. Garfield finished his speech, the chairman announced a free discussion on current international issues. Therefore, various members raised issues such as naval reduction and the Far East question, and the discussion did not end until half past ten.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Banquets Fuller the Previous Noon</h3>
<p>Invited Business and Banking Circles as Companions</p>
<p>Fuller, General Manager of the Philippine Civil News (菲律濱民報), Modesco Faronlan, came to China for a tour. He arrived in Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. He visited Mayor Wu at the City Government and visited the construction of Greater Shanghai. At one o'clock yesterday afternoon, Mayor Wu specially held a banquet for Fuller at the restaurant on the 14th floor of the International Hotel, inviting more than twenty people from the local business and banking circles and Chinese and foreign news media to accompany him. During the banquet, they all expressed their views on promoting Sino-Philippine trade and exchanged them.</p>
<h3>Fang Kegen Talks about International Congresses</h3>
<p>The Yulin News reported that Lieutenant Colonel Fang Kegen, a representative of Belgium at the International Congress of the Red Cross held in Tokyo last month, is the Director of the Standing Committee of the International Congress on Military Medicine. After completing his official duties, he came to China for a short tour and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. According to Shenger yesterday, international disarmament is unlikely to be successful, causing the general public to be fearful of a new war. They also hope that non-combatants can obtain a way to be safe in any future war. The committee he presides over is engaged in this humanitarian work. The committee was established only more than ten years ago, and at first, it only paid attention to the lives and hygiene of soldiers in peacetime and wartime. When the Congress was held in Madrid, the capital of Spain, in 1933, it expanded its scope of work and passed three proposals, aimed at opening medical and safe cities during wartime, making every effort to protect the people participating in the battle, and dealing with incidents that violate the Geneva Convention. Later, a meeting was held in Liège, with participants from thirty countries, and more detailed plans were passed. At that time, Belgian Defense Minister David proposed to convene an international congress in Brussels on a selected date, so that the various articles decided can obtain diplomatic approval from various countries. He recently presented the points discussed on that day at the Red Cross Congress, and the audience unanimously supported them. The international congress has been scheduled to be held in June 1935, and the Belgian Foreign Minister will invite various countries to send official representatives to the meeting, so as to formulate new international laws on this move. He met with Director Wang and other dignitaries in the capital on Thursday and was promised to send representatives to attend at the time. There are now thirty-five countries that have agreed to participate. He will go to Qianjing Pan Gu immediately to ask the government of that country to also assist.</p>
<h3>The Chongde Fellow Townsmen's Association Pleads for the Lives of 100,000 Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Sends Letters to Various Charitable Organizations Urging Swift Emergency Relief</p>
<p>Among the drought disasters in various provinces this year, Zhejiang is the most serious, and among the counties of Zhejiang, Chongde County in western Zhejiang is particularly serious. The Fellow Townsmen's Association of the county in Shanghai has repeatedly held meetings on disaster relief. First, the Fellow Townsmen's Association remitted 1,000 yuan to implement porridge distribution. At the same time, Hua Zhen from Zhenxin Company contacted disaster relief organizations such as the Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, requesting swift emergency relief to save the disaster victims. Now, the original letter from the association to various charitable organizations is recorded as follows: Dear Sirs, Chongde has been suffering from a long drought this summer, resulting in an unprecedented disaster. The rivers are dry, the fields are cracked, and the autumn harvest is completely lost. There are wailing victims everywhere. Even bandits are rising up, and public security is worrying. The way to treat the symptoms is to provide emergency relief. After the county has suffered the decline of the silk industry, merchants and farmers are exhausted. It is like climbing a tree to catch a fish to raise a large amount of money for relief. Without the assistance of various charitable organizations, more than 100,000 disaster victims will only sit and wait for death. Luo Zhongda, the magistrate of Chongde County, could not bear to sit idly by and watch the tragic situation of the disaster victims. He personally came to Shanghai to beg for relief and paid his respects to your association, informing you of the disaster situation in person. He was registered and promised to give priority to the distribution of relief, which is deeply appreciated. Due to our relationship with our hometown, our association has done its best to run around and solicit donations for more than a month. Unfortunately, it is just a drop in the bucket, not enough to satisfy the disaster victims for one meal. After much deliberation, we have to ask your association to allocate relief funds as soon as possible to help the disaster victims. We believe that your association will treat all relief matters equally and will never have any provincial or county prejudices. We are especially bold in pleading on behalf of the disaster victims in our county, and we sincerely ask you to grant our request and quickly allocate relief funds to revive the dried crucian carp. We are extremely hopeful. Sincerely, the Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, the Disaster Relief Associations of various provinces, the Red Swastika Society, the China International Famine Relief Commission, and the National Government Disaster Relief Commission.</p>
<h3>Public Associations May Not Use Representative System for Elections</h3>
<p>Explanation from the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco and Exchange Industry Guild Association has many members, nearly a thousand. Previously, due to legally handling re-election, it was deeply worried that the number of people could not reach two-thirds. It specially submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, intending to use a representative system to handle the re-election. The Social Affairs Bureau believed that the matter involved changing legal procedures and was not easy to approve without authorization. It then submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry for instructions. Now, it has been learned that the Ministry of Industry's instructions on this case are document Shang Zi No. 29518: 1. It is found that the election of officers of public associations and the convening of members' meetings may, in accordance with Article 10 of the Law of Industrial and Commercial Guilds, follow the provisions of the Law of Chambers of Commerce regarding officers and meetings. Article 18 of the Law of Chambers of Commerce states, "The executive committee and supervisory committee shall be elected from among the representatives of the members at the members' meeting." It is not called a members' representative meeting. The statutory number of members at the above members' meeting shall be handled in accordance with Article 27 of the Law of Chambers of Commerce. The request to use a representative system for elections has no legal basis and cannot be approved.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Niu's Birthday Celebration</h3>
<p>Madam Ni, mother of the famous physicians Dr. Niu Huilin and Niu Huisheng, and the educators Miss Niu Huizhu and Niu Huizhen, celebrated her sixty-ninth birthday yesterday. Madam Ni is the sister of Song Ziwen's mother. She is a devout Christian and, because of the difficult times, does not allow celebrations. Niu Huilin and Niu Huisheng respectfully followed their mother's instructions and did not send invitations or avoid extravagance. On that day, only a thanksgiving service was held at Niu Huisheng's residence, because blessings and longevity are given by God. Pastor Li Fuji led the singing of hymns and prayers, Dr. Bu Fangji blessed, and the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Chiang Kai-shek, and the Minister of Finance, Kong Xiangxi, as well as Madam Soong Ai-ling and Madam Soong Mei-ling, in addition to sending precious gifts, entrusted Song Ziliang and Zian to represent them. Song Ziwen, however, was attending a meeting in Beijing and sent his wife, Madam Zhang Leyi, to offer birthday greetings. Sun Soong Ching-ling, a member of the Central Committee, and Sun Ke's wife, as well as dozens of famous Chinese and Western figures and scholars, also participated in the worship sincerely to express their congratulations. A celebration banquet was held that evening, accompanied by singing and music, and the guests dispersed happily late into the night. Madam is compassionate and pitiful for the old, weak, helpless, and displaced. She has spent a lot of money to build a nursing home in Beiqiao, which will be completed within the year and can accommodate hundreds of poor old men and widows. Madam instructed her children to use the money for the birthday celebration to cover the expenses of the hospital, and all the congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends were also donated to help, so as to do good. Dr. Niu and others will invite relatives and friends to visit when the nursing home is completed and express their apologies for their mother's non-issuance of invitations.</p>
<h3>Fire at Zhaozhou Road Last Night</h3>
<p>Four Shikumen Buildings Destroyed</p>
<p>At 7:10 last night, a fire suddenly broke out at the Meili Knitting Factory at No. 5 Taian Lane, Zhaozhou Road, Nanyang Bridge, in the Chinese Concession of the South City.

As a result, the houses on the left and right, Nos. 4, 6, and 7, were also affected. The branch is currently investigating the cause of the fire.</p>

Due to the dedication of Principal Xiao Youmei and the sincere cooperation of the professors, the students have been able to reach the standards of European and American conservatories in a short period of time. Chinese and foreign visitors to the school have all praised it. Last month, the school held a faculty concert at the Grand Hall of the New Asia Hotel. The news spread throughout Shanghai. Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau praised it highly after the concert, calling it unprecedented. Now, the school has selected outstanding students from various departments to hold a concert on the eve of November 27th, its seventh anniversary, to celebrate and publicly showcase their achievements. It is said that the performance will still be held in the Grand Hall of the New Asia Hotel because previous concerts were often held in halls that were too small, causing many listeners to be turned away after tickets were sold out. This time, the concert is being held in the New Asia Hotel's Grand Hall to provide more seating for the audience. It is expected that there will be another grand occasion at that time.</p>

<h3>The Sixth National Goods Movement Fair Will Hold a Lantern Parade Tomorrow Evening</h3>
<p>The Municipal People's Education Center Conducted Costume Promotion Yesterday</p>
<p>The current National Goods Movement Fair was originally scheduled to hold a publicity week for seven days. Yesterday was the fifth day. The publicity work has become increasingly important, and the performances have become increasingly exciting. Yesterday, the Municipal People's Education Center was responsible for costume promotion. The number of people entering the venue was not reduced due to the rain in the morning, and there were entry restrictions, with no children participating. The order was very good. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Postal Items Stamped with Slogans The current fair has adopted many publicity methods. Postal items stamped with slogans are the most widespread and effective. Prior to the current fair, the Municipal Government forwarded a request to the Ministry of Communications to instruct the Shanghai Postal Administration to stamp all postal items passing through the General Post Office with slogans during the publicity week to promote the event. It has been found that the General Post Office has been using a specially made stamp to print the twelve large characters [Advocate Economic Salvation, Everyone Uses National Goods] on various postal items for several days, with the words "Shanghai Sixth National Goods Movement Publicity Week" noted on the side, which is very eye-catching.</p>
<p>Lantern Parade Tomorrow Evening Tomorrow is the last day of the fair's publicity week. In addition to the usual publicity activities during the day, a lantern parade will be held in the evening. According to reports in various newspapers, 150 factories in the city have applied to participate in the parade, and it is expected that many more factories will participate. The parade registration is being handled by the Women's National Goods Year Movement Association. The order of the parade is based on the sequence attached to the application forms at the time of registration. It is reported that the fair has notified participating factories to gather in the open space in front of the venue at 6:00 PM tomorrow and depart at 7:00 PM, marching along Zhonghua Road to the south, turning into Minguo Road at Xiaodongmen, and returning to the venue to disperse.</p>
<p>Costume Promotion and Performances Yesterday, the costume promotion for the fair's publicity week was carried out by the Municipal People's Education Center. It began with a comical performance of various national goods promotion songs, followed by the performance of the drama "Zhi Tong Dao Quan." It is said that the script of this drama was specially written and arranged by the center for the fair's publicity. The material was reasonable, the plot was exciting, and the actors worked especially hard. The entire drama focused on publicity and was full of stimulating elements. The audience was deeply moved and applauded enthusiastically. It started at 1:20 PM and ended at 3:40 PM. The remaining time was filled by the Lizhong Middle School Harmonica Team performing three songs, the Shanghai Kindergarten Normal School performing a field dance, and the Amateur Friendship Drama Society performing the "Wake Up, Wake Up" vernacular play, which was very exciting. Each scene contained profound implications for encouraging the use of national goods.</p>
<p>The Business Community Group Inspects Sales Items The fair's business community group (composed of four organizations) has seen the national goods market develop rapidly. All participating factories replenish their goods every day. In order to be cautious and prevent any mishaps, the group convened its sixth group affairs meeting the night before to discuss methods to prevent any problems. As a result, Xu Jianruo (Advocacy Association), Xu Genghua (Maintenance Association), Cao Zhigong (Factory Federation), and Ren Tugang (Machine Federation) were appointed to jointly inspect all the sales items in the market. It is reported that the fair's organizing committee also sent personnel to the venue every day to investigate. According to their reports, they were quite satisfied. It is also reported that the fair, due to the excellent publicity situation in recent days, extended the hours by half an hour the day before, and yesterday it was possible to extend the hours until after 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>All Circles Mourn Xu Jigong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hundreds of Representatives from All Circles Attended</p>
<p>According to the National Society, the death of Xu Jigong of the Overseas Chinese Federation has caused great regret in all quarters. The Shanghai Xinwei Relief Association, led by Xu Jingren, and other organizations held a memorial service at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 2:00 PM yesterday. Those who attended included Li Denghui, Jiang Kanghu, Xi Guansheng, Xiang Kangyuan, Liu Shimu, Liu Jichen, Weng Zhiguang, Wang Ruizhu, Huang Jingwan, and others, numbering several hundred. The venue was set up in the YMCA Grand Hall, with mourning couplets and wreaths from all circles hanging around the hall. First, Li Denghui reported the purpose of the meeting. Cui Tongyue reported on Xu's life, saying that when the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed, Mr. Xu founded the Taiwan Democratic State, serving as Minister of Finance and concurrently as Vice Minister of the Army, making great efforts. Later, the Zhongshan failed, but Mr. Xu was not discouraged. When Premier Sun Yat-sen fled to Taiwan, Mr. Xu talked with him all night, planning to start an uprising from Taiwan. The matter was leaked, and Premier Sun Yat-sen was forced to leave. The business operated by Mr. Xu was also confiscated. He also served as the commander of the National Protection Army, planning to attack the Fujian border. He was lured and imprisoned by the Japanese authorities in Shuikou. Later, he brought his family to Shanghai to engage in industry. Later, he personally inspected industries and education in various ports in Southeast Asia and was elected as the Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Federation, promoting industry with all his strength. This spring, he reorganized the Elders' Autonomy Promotion Association and the Fujian Mining Preparatory Office. He died of exhaustion at the Gulangyu Consortia, and so on.

<h3>Russian Car Causes Accident, Xu Jinrong Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Speeding Leads to This Tragedy</p>
<p>Police Bring Back for Investigation and Prosecution</p>
<p>Xu Jinrong, the 59-year-old factory director of the Kaiyuan Electrical and Chemical Plant, a native of Suzhou, lived at No. 7, Jinxiu Lane, near Jingxiu Road, West Gate. At around 7:00 PM the night before, he was riding in his own hired rickshaw, pulled by rickshaw puller Yang Shaorong, returning home from the factory. Unexpectedly, while passing through the intersection of Daxilu and Dunxin, a Russian named Boduogaofu (phonetic) was driving a car with license plate number 6549 from west to east. Due to speeding, the car arrived from behind. Failing to brake in time, the car crashed into the rickshaw, overturning it. Xu was thrown out of the rickshaw as a result and suffered severe injuries in his joints. The rickshaw puller Yang Shaorong was also injured in the leg by the car. The incident was spotted by Chinese Constable No. 296 on guard duty, who immediately reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station by telephone. An ambulance was called, and the injured master and servant were sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Detective Afu and others were dispatched to investigate the scene. Unfortunately, Xu's injuries were too severe, and the medical treatment was ineffective, and he died soon after. The body was taken to Ferenzan for an autopsy. The Western Constable reported the investigation process first and then interrogated Boduogaofu, who stated that he was Russian, 29 years old, lived at No. 26, Masnan Road, and was a music teacher. Around 8:00 PM that night, he was driving his car through the area. The car's front lights were small, so he didn't see the rickshaw at the time. When he noticed, he couldn't avoid it. Xu Yongchi, the son of the deceased, testified that he was an employee in the machinery department of the Miyaji Foreign Company and was unaware of the incident at the time. He only found out after someone told him. He rushed to the hospital to visit and was told by employees of the Kaiyuan Factory that they had witnessed the car speeding at the time and that the Westerner seemed to be drunk, causing the accident. He requested that the police be informed and that the Westerner be prosecuted. Chinese Constable No. 2926 also provided testimony. Tang Jun then examined the body of the deceased, Xu Jinrong, male, and confirmed that he had died from injuries sustained when he was hit by car number 6549. The driver of the car, Boduogaofu, was suspected of causing death through negligence and should be investigated by the police. Xu Yongchi, the son of the deceased, signed a statement to claim the body for burial. It was also heard that the Russian only had a test driving license and has now been sent back to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Failure to Obtain Loan, Thugs Beat Elderly Woman to Death</h3>
<p>Four Suspects Detained by Police Awaiting Interrogation</p>
<p>Chen Du, a 59-year-old woman from Taizhou living at No. 19, Jianyun Lane, Ouyang Road, Hongkou, owed money to Wang Xiaosizi, a neighbor who pulled rickshaws, for a mutual aid association. She was unable to repay the loan. Although Wang Xiaosizi had repeatedly demanded repayment, the woman found it difficult to make ends meet, let alone find extra money to repay the debt. As a result, Wang harbored resentment. At around 8:00 PM the night before, Wang Xiaosizi, along with several others, suddenly went to the woman's home to demand the money. An argument broke out, and Wang was enraged and ordered the others to attack. The elderly woman, who was nearing the end of her life, could not withstand the group of thugs and was beaten to death. Bystanders, seeing this, were outraged and called the police. The police arrested Wang and the four accomplices and detained them at the police station for questioning. Yesterday morning, the police ordered He Xujinlin of the 23rd He 15th Tu, to report to the local court for an autopsy.</p>

<h3>The Railway Bureau Investigates the Scenic Spots of Tianping Mountain</h3>
<p>Red Leaves Cover the Mountain, Perfect for Viewing</p>
<p>Suzhou is a famous scenic spot in Jiangnan, especially the scenery of Tianping Mountain, which is well-known. In order to facilitate the visit of people from all walks of life, the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration has specially dispatched personnel to investigate the transportation and food conditions for visiting the mountain. The results are published as follows: 1. During this short spring season, the maple leaves on the mountain have all turned red, blooming like brocade, perfect for viewing. Visiting the tomb of Fan Zhongyan, paying homage to the sages, and passing through the One-Line Sky to climb Baiyun Mountain, overlooking Taihu Lake, is especially elegant and pleasant. 2. Buy a boat at Gemeng and use a motorboat to tow it. If there are 40 to 50 people, each person only needs to spend one yuan, and the time is most economical. You can take the Shanghai-Nanjing Express train at 8:00 AM from Shanghai to Suzhou, transfer to a boat to the mountain, and take the Nanjing-Shanghai Express train at 4:27 PM back to Shanghai in the afternoon, which is very convenient. 3. If you hire a special tour boat, the round-trip fare is at most ten yuan per boat, and at least five or six yuan, depending on the size of the boat (the larger ones can accommodate more than 20 people, and the smaller ones about 10 people). However, you must take the Shanghai-Nanjing Express train at 9:46 PM back to Shanghai. 4. There are no restaurants on the mountain. You can have meals on the boat. The boat dishes are very delicious, about three or four yuan per table, which can feed eight people. 5. It is about 1.5 kilometers from the pier to the foot of the mountain. Take a sedan chair, which costs about half a yuan per chair. 6. You can also hire a rickshaw to the mountain. It is also learned that if tourists need to use motorboats or tour boats, they can contact the traffic department of the Railway Administration or the stationmaster at Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and other stations in advance to arrange for hire.</p>
<h3>Liang Tongfang Sentenced to Six Months in Prison for Throwing a Bomb at the Yuelai Noodle Shop</h3>
<p>Suspended for One Year, Permitted to Provide Reliable Shopkeepers as Bail, Ready to Appear When Summoned</p>
<p>Liang's Injury After the Wrist Fracture Has Healed, There Is Still Slight Pus on Two Fingers</p>
<p>Liang Tongfang, who served as a member of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, brought a bomb to the Guangdong Yuelai Noodle Shop at noon on the 19th of last month, intending to make a statement. The bomb suddenly fell to the ground and exploded, causing slight injuries to the shop's partners and customers Wu Wengao, Gui, Pan Honghe, Chuan Rongsheng, and Ding Yanzhi. Liang's arm also suffered a huge injury. The police were informed and dispatched detectives to the scene, sending Liang and the other injured to the hospital for treatment. After Liang recovered from his injuries, a public prosecution was filed with the First Special District Local Court in accordance with the law. After repeated investigations, the details have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning was the date for the sentencing of the case. Police detectives escorted Liang Tongfang to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Presiding Judge Feng Shide ascended the bench and announced the verdict. The main text stated that Liang Tongfang was sentenced to six months in prison for possessing explosives with the intention of committing a crime. The detention period would be calculated at two days to offset one day of imprisonment, with a two-year suspension of the sentence. The bomb fragments were confiscated. The appeal period was granted to allow reliable shopkeepers to provide bail, ready to appear when summoned. As for the rumor that Liang's injury was still serious, it was not true. Liang's left arm had been blown off at the time, so the hospital amputated the section from the wrist down. The wound has now completely healed, but the two fingers injured on his right hand still have slight pus, so they are still bandaged.</p>
<h3>The Haihong Warship Captures Pirates in Taoshan Port and Escorts Them to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Three Pirates Have Been Sent to Court, Four Hostages Released on Bail</p>
<p>The Haihong Warship of the Fisheries Protection Office of the Ministry of Industry captured pirates in Taoshan Port and escorted them to Shanghai yesterday to be handed over to the court for investigation. The details are divided as follows:</p>
<h3>Escorted to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Fisheries Protection Office, because it is the winter fishing season, dispatched warships to protect each section of the sea. On the 9th of this month, the Haihong saw three suspicious civilian ships in the waters of Taoshan Port. They ignored the signals and surrounded the warship, engaging in a fierce battle. The warship then launched a campaign, capturing seven people and one ship. Yesterday, the captain of the warship, Liang Yi'e, personally escorted them to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Bandit Leader Dies</h3>
<p>After the pirates were escorted to the Fisheries Protection Office, the security section chief interrogated them separately. According to their confessions, their names were Chen Xuemei, Chen Lvpu, and Chen Dafa. Two were the leaders of the bandits. One was named Shi Laohua, who had died from a gunshot wound. One was named Da Chensan, who was not on the boat and had gathered 34 people in Jinpengdun. They had a total of 24 firearms and three boats. One was sunk, one was captured, and one escaped. All of their confessions were recorded.</p>
<h3>Four Hostages</h3>
<p>When the Haihong Warship was engaged in a fierce battle with the pirates, it captured a total of seven people on the pirate ship. Yesterday, after interrogation, it was found that all four were fishermen who had been tied up on the boat. Their names were Luo Yongtang, Zuo Chongjian, Jin Yutang, and Chen Jinwei, all of whom were good people from Huangyan. They had been kidnapped by the pirates for a long time. Fortunately, they were rescued by the patrol ship.</p>
<h3>Separate Handling</h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the Fisheries Protection Office yesterday that the three pirates will be handed over to the local court for handling in accordance with the law. As for the four hostages, the Ningbo fellow villagers association and the ice and fresh industry association requested bail, and after the office confirmed that they were indeed good fishermen, they were all allowed to be released on bail.</p>
<h3>Intensify Prevention</h3>
<p>The Fisheries Protection Office ordered all its warships to step up their prevention efforts during the winter fishing season and dispatched more soldiers to increase their strength. The Haiying Warship was assigned to patrol the waters of Wenzhou and Taizhou near Shenjiamen, and the No. 5 and No. 6 guerrilla warships were assigned to patrol Langgang.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Police Bureau Releases Crime Statistics for One Week</h3>
<p>An Increase of Eighteen Cases Compared to Last Week</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau released yesterday that in the past week, from the 10th of this month to yesterday, there were 252 criminal cases in the territory, including 43 cases of adultery and abduction, 7 cases of assault, 49 cases of theft and receiving stolen goods, 31 cases of opium, 7 cases of robbery and robbery, 1 case of kidnapping, 1 case of counterfeiting currency, 5 cases of fire, 7 cases of communist party, and 36 other criminal cases.

After the preliminary investigation by the Third Section, they have been transferred to the local court and other competent authorities for handling. The number of criminal cases detected this week increased by 20 compared to last week.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Sanitation Report</h3>
<p>The Superintendent of the Public Health Department of the Council reports for the month of October that special efforts were made during the month to collect birth reports, with the result that for the first time the number of births among Chinese residents exceeded the number of deaths. The statistics are gradually taking effect, and the school children's physical examination has been formally carried out, and there has been initial progress in the health of young children. The health guidance pamphlets have also been published in Russian this month and distributed to 1,300 copies. Birth statistics for foreigners were 16,095, and for Chinese, 1,577 were reported, of which 61 were born to non-residents. The death rate for foreigners was 9.058, and for Chinese, 12.36. The causes of death were mostly tuberculosis, dysentery, and typhoid, but diphtheria and influenza were also common. Among infectious diseases, no smallpox was found within the Concession, but there were several cases outside the Concession. Two people died from rabies, one of whom received 18 injections, but it was ineffective. One died without any treatment. The disease testing laboratory conducted 3,790 tests, of which 680 had positive results. 203 food samples were inspected, of which 42 were substandard. The Chinese Isolation Hospital received the most cases of diphtheria, and many patients died from respiratory diseases, all because the patients were admitted too late. There were four requests for admission to the mental hospital that were rejected because there were no remaining spaces. The mortality rate in the Ward Road Prison was 2.18, the lowest in many years. The school children's physical examination is progressing satisfactorily, and nurses continue to pay attention separately at any time after the examination. Children with infectious diseases who were previously unaware of them are now identified, which can prevent them from being transmitted to other children, which is of great benefit. The most important disease among school children is trachoma. The prevention methods do not cost much and should be implemented for the benefit of the citizens. Dr. Mo reported that the average daily milk production for the month was 31,59 pounds, an increase of 7.79 percent over the previous month. The production of cheese and cream was investigated for the first time, with the former averaging about 352 pounds per day and the latter 41 pounds. Six milk samples failed the chemical standards, and 18 failed the bacterial standards. The number of slaughters increased as usual. The number of private pig slaughters is gradually increasing, and the location will not be able to accommodate it, which is very worrying. 56,037 people were vaccinated against smallpox this month, and 3,220 registered rickshaw pullers were vaccinated. Well water disinfection was stopped due to the cold weather. River bank oiling continued because mosquitoes were still breeding.</p>
<h3>Unregistered Dentist Fined for Operating</h3>
<p>Dentist Dong Chufang recently opened a dental clinic and denture shop at No. 97, East Zilaihuo Street, French Concession. He had not applied for a certificate from the French Municipal Council in advance, nor had he been approved. The matter was discovered by the Health Department of the French Municipal Council. Despite several bans and two penalties, Dong ignored them and continued to operate as usual. On October 8, the Makelan Police Station strictly prohibited the operation and instructed him to go to the Municipal Council to register. Dong ignored it and continued to operate. On the day before yesterday, the head of the police station found that Dong was still treating dental diseases for people, which was a violation of the regulations. Yesterday morning, he summoned Li to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer Chen Ming stated the case and requested that the consul general's council be judged in accordance with the case. Dong Chufang admitted to violating the regulations by operating without registration. The judge verified the confession and announced the verdict in court, ordering the defendant to register as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Small View Garden Chrysanthemum Show</h3>
<p>The chrysanthemums of Small View Garden have always been renowned. The chrysanthemum exhibitions sponsored by the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau in previous years, as well as the Dongjiadu Fire Brigade chrysanthemum show, and the Guanshengyuan chrysanthemum competition, etc., all participated and won first place and excellent awards. This autumn, the garden has collected famous varieties from China and abroad, and imported domestic old varieties from Beijing, Shanlou, Yangzhou, Nantong, and other places, totaling a thousand varieties. Therefore, starting today, a thousand-variety chrysanthemum show is being held in the main garden at the intersection of Jiangwan Sports Association West Road and Shuida Road for public exhibition. It is said that the layout is designed by famous chrysanthemum artists Shen Yunsheng, Zou Zejun, Shen Xingyuan, and Zhu Pingu, dividing the chrysanthemums into different categories such as large-flowered, thin-stemmed, medium-flowered, literary-style, and military-style, each placed in a separate room. There are also chrysanthemum manuals distributed to guests, so that visitors can understand at a glance, with detailed descriptions of their posture and color. It is truly an unprecedented chrysanthemum show in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Reduction of Rent on Minguo Road News</h3>
<p>Fuchang Real Estate Company and Grain Exchange</p>
<p>Rent Reduction Issues for Two Properties Resolved</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Minguo Road Rent Reduction Association has achieved success due to the unified action of all commercial firms, the effective measures taken by the Rent Reduction Association, and the deep understanding of righteousness by the landlords. As a result, one-third of the rent reductions have been resolved. Recently, regarding the properties of the Grain Exchange on Minguo Road, after the Rent Reduction Association sent a letter, the exchange convened a shareholders' meeting. It was generally agreed that the rental prices of the exchange's properties were actually lower than those of other operators engaged in the same business, and there was no harsh increase in rent. Therefore, due to cost considerations, it was difficult to accept the rent reduction. However, after receiving the letter from the Rent Reduction Association, it was agreed to comply at a 10% discount to fulfill the spirit of mutual assistance. After receiving this news, the Rent Reduction Association sought the consent of all tenants. As a result, both parties reached a satisfactory resolution. Furthermore, regarding the properties of the Fuchang Real Estate Company on Minguo Road, after the Rent Reduction Association sent a letter, the tenants had refused to pay rent for five months. Both sides went to extremes, which was not a long-term solution. Yesterday, the Rent Reduction Association convened both parties to make concessions. The previous rent of 180 yuan was now changed to 160 yuan to reach a resolution. Therefore, the rent reduction on Minguo Road has been progressing smoothly and easily. There are still other landlords who have not yet expressed their opinions. The Rent Reduction Association is now proceeding with the second step of its work to achieve early success.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Silk Industry Bank West Branch to Open the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank on Hankou Road has an outstanding reputation and prosperous business. Recently, considering that the Jing'an Temple Road area in Western Shanghai is densely populated, with rows of houses, and has always been known as a residential area, and that residents in the area have frequently requested the establishment of a branch, the bank's board of directors decided to establish a West Branch at the original site of the West Branch of the Four Banks Savings Society at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road. The preparations have been completed and the decoration has been refreshed. The opening is scheduled for the 20th of this month. It has been announced in the newspaper, welcoming people from all walks of life to visit and provide guidance, without issuing separate invitations. It is reported that the bank has hired Mr. Chen Jicheng as the manager of the West Branch. Mr. Chen has been in the social service for many years, has rich experience, and has extensive connections. The future development of the branch can be confidently expected. It is also learned that at the opening, a new chapter of the bank's "Sheng Sheng Savings" will be created, with innovative methods and excellent interest rates, which will be greatly welcomed by the residents of the area. In order to reward the support and kindness of people from all walks of life, exquisite gifts will be given out according to the regulations during the opening anniversary period. Furthermore, it is learned that the Family Industry Society, in view of the bank's years of service to society and its unremitting advocacy of using national products, has specially made 1,000 exquisite beauty gift boxes containing various precious cosmetics to send to the bank to express congratulations and promote it widely. It is reported that the bank has decided to distribute these gifts to depositors according to the regulations to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<h3>Completion of New Building for Buddhist Orphanage</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Buddhist Association, in view of the pity of uneducated and fierce children, specially borrowed the Shilian Temple on Gonghexin Road last year to establish an orphanage. Guan Tongyi was publicly recommended to manage it. Last winter, six new buildings were built on the remaining land of the temple, which have now been completed. The completion ceremony is scheduled to be held this afternoon. According to Mr. Cao Yigong, the person in charge of the orphanage, it is expected that many people will visit at that time. Special request has been made for the Renhui Boy Scouts to stand guard along the road from the old bus station on Zhongxing Road to provide hospitality.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Tremella Cures Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I passed the Sichuan store on Nanjing Road (at the intersection of Shanxi Road) and saw seven or eight people surrounding a neatly dressed middle-upper class man speaking with a Zhejiang accent. Upon inquiring, I learned that this man was Xu Ruliang from Quan Gongting Town, Pinghu. His wife's health was inherently weak, with insufficient blood and years of suffering from leukorrhea. She had been treated with both Chinese and Western medicines, spending a lot of money, but all were ineffective. Later, through an introduction, she began to purchase Sichuan tremella sold by Sichuan stores and tried to take it according to the prescription. After a while, she was completely cured, and her body became stronger than ever. She is now pregnant and about to give birth. Before he finished speaking, many people immediately rushed to Sichuan stores to buy one or two taels of tremella for six or seven yuan, each buying two or three taels. In a short time, more than ten taels were sold. It can be seen that if a store sells goods that are truly authentic, the word-of-mouth promotion by customers is more effective than thousands of yuan in advertising expenses.</p>
<h3>French Army Exercise - Blank Firing</h3>

<h3>Special Feature: Several Fundamental Issues of the Chinese Constitution (5)</h3>
<p>Lecture by Mr. Sun Zhe, President of the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>— Speed record by Fan Shiqin.</p>
<h3>8. The Issue of Unified Military Power</h3>
<p>China often has one or two provinces becoming independent and opposing the central government. If we want to permanently control the localities, there is indeed the issue of military power. China's situation is abnormal: the central government has troops, and the localities also have troops. China has not become a country ruled by law because China does not possess this most important condition. The biggest obstacle is that military power has not yet been unified. This makes it impossible for China to continue to exist. This is China's deep pain. We suffer from the oppression of imperialism, but we cannot resist because resisting foreign aggression requires the strength of the entire nation. For example, Shanghai fights desperately with others, but it is only the strength of Shanghai alone, or at most the strength of Jiangsu province. Even if Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are combined, it is still only the strength of two provinces, not the strength of the whole country. Under this abnormal organization, it is impossible to mobilize the whole country to resist foreign aggression. For example, if the government issues an order to resist, they might say, "We are local troops, resisting foreign aggression is the central government's business, we are not responsible for that." If military power cannot be unified in a country, its strength cannot be united, and naturally there will be no possibility of resisting foreign aggression. If the army is established for the country, then the localities should not have troops. Once there are bandits in a locality, the central government can order troops to be dispatched to suppress them, so that the army belongs entirely to the state. But China now has very few national troops, which is the biggest problem. In foreign countries, the army belongs to the state, not to the Zhang family or the Ma family, nor to a certain province. Therefore, the concentration of military power is the only condition for unification, and it is clearly stipulated in the constitution.</p>
<h3>9. The Issue of Unified Economy</h3>
<p>The constitution also clearly stipulates the economy, because it is also very important. The economy is related to the people of the whole country. A country is an economic unit. We know that there are many economic units in Europe, because each state has its own customs, so their tariffs are different, and each has its own unit. China's economy is also different in various places. Some places use silver dollars, some use small silver dollars, and the market prices are also different, and the exchange rates are also different. When foreigners come to China, they think China's economy is extremely strange, saying that China is really a joke, and that if you bring money to China, don't use it, it will disappear, because the exchange rates are different everywhere. After exchanging a sum of money many times, the money will be gone. That is to say, China's economy is not unified, the country's economy cannot circulate, and each province collects taxes on its own to protect its own economy, so that the country's economy does not have a system, which is indeed the case. China's other province seems to be a different country, not a part of China. Then China has twenty-eight provinces, which is like twenty-eight countries, and there are also twenty-eight economic units.</p>
<p>Europeans, whether British or French, have admired Americans in the past few years, thinking that America is a continent with only one economic unit. The area of Europe is as large as America, but it is divided into more than thirty countries, and goods cannot circulate. People who go to Europe find it very annoying. After taking the train for half a day, they have to change to another country and check customs. Therefore, the economy of the United States can develop in this way, relying on their unified economic power. There are too many economic units in Europe. But the economic disunity of China's twenty-eight provinces is almost equal to that of Europe. If we don't start catching up now, it will be too late in a few years. In fact, economic unification is even more important than political and military unification. Only when these three aspects are unified can the country be considered completely unified, otherwise, there is no hope. The constitution stipulates a kind of commodity tax, which can only be collected by the central government, and the local government cannot collect additional taxes on its own. This is a very important thing. What I am talking about is these things. There is not much time, so I will not say more. (The End)</p>

<h3>Confidence</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>What is confidence? It is to trust one's own abilities, to do one's best in what one does, and to always have the mindset that one can overcome it.</p>
<p>Didn't I ask you to set goals last time? Good! Now that we have goals and plans to achieve them, we must put them into practice. Although goals may seem distant and vague, with plans, we must implement them. Don't retreat from goals, have courage, believe in our abilities, do our best, and one day we will achieve our purpose.</p>
<p>If we lack confidence and are afraid of our goals and plans, and dare not implement them, what's the use? Goals will always be good and grand, but you will never achieve them.</p>
<p>Didn't the Father of the Nation say, [With faith, there is power]? If you don't even trust your own abilities, what power do you have to achieve your goals!</p>
<h3>Childhoods of World Celebrities</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Gandhi</p>
<p>Gandhi was the leader of the non-cooperation movement in India. Children must have heard his name. He was an Indian. His father was called Kaba Gandhi. He was born on December, 1869.</p>
<p>When he was young, he was not gifted. He entered elementary school at the age of six and was not very interested in his studies. It took him a lot of time to understand the multiplication table. A year later, because his father went to Rajkot to be a minister, he transferred to a junior primary school there, but he was still an ordinary elementary school student.</p>
<p>However, after he entered middle school, everything was different. His conduct and studies were very satisfactory, and he improved year by year. However, his body was very weak. He just stood in the corner of the playground and watched others exercise and play. Because the Indians believe in [Jainism,] which takes non-killing as its creed, Gandhi was of course also a believer. At this time, some young people, in order to strengthen their bodies, advocated meat-eating, and some people ridiculed Gandhi for being so weak and advised him to eat meat, but he firmly believed in religion and never changed. However, he paid attention to exercise and often took walks to strengthen his body.</p>
<p>Gandhi was married at the age of twelve, but he hated his own early marriage, which weakened his body and hindered his studies. He once said: [I don't know how many people have encountered the same situation as me! Studying and getting married at the same time is harmful for life!]</p>
<p>After Gandhi grew up, he became a lawyer, and he was fair and just, which won the people's trust. Later, he was elected as the leader of the revolutionary movement, advocating autonomy and demanding independence. On July 28, 1920, Gandhi declared that he would not cooperate with the British and implemented a boycott of British goods, creating his own hand-woven cloth machine, spinning and weaving himself as a way to promote it. After being arrested, he went on a hunger strike to show his determination. Gandhi's spirit is really worth emulating!</p>
<h3>Rely on Yourself</h3>
<p>— Rongyu</p>
<p>Plant your own trees, chop your own firewood. Strengthen your muscles and bones, invigorate your spirit. Do your own things, why bother others everywhere. Laziness turns into uselessness; labor tempers a strong body. In today's world, labor is sacred, I advise you not to be lazy!</p>
<p>Study hard, knowledge grows. Do more things, the body is strong. Ten thousand taels of gold are easily exhausted, a skill in hand is enough to make a living. Many princes weep on the roadside, but laborers are rarely seen starving on the road. Do not rely on relatives and friends' property, self-reliance and self-sufficiency are most honorable.</p>
<h3>Diary</h3>
<p>— Chonglou</p>
<p>Keeping a diary is also an important daily event. Because it can make life orderly and can help develop writing skills and practice penmanship.</p>
<p>If a person keeps a diary continuously from childhood until old age, then these decades of diaries accumulated will definitely be a rich personal history: a huge book of life experience.</p>
<p>However, when keeping a diary, don't be too methodical: trivial daily matters don't need to be recorded. We should always record fresh facts or thoughts.</p>
<p>One day, I opened my little sister's diary and saw that she always wrote what time she got up, what time she ate, what time she went to school, what time she came home, what time she went to sleep, ... these same sentences. At that time, I said to her: [If you keep a diary like this, except for the weather and time changes, it can simply be engraved on a block and printed every day! So you must improve this habit in the future and no longer write about eating and sleeping in your diary. ...]</p>
<p>Father's and brother's advice, teacher's teachings, friend's encouragement... these are all good materials for our diary. If we work hard and make progress in our studies, recording it in our diary is an even more glorious page.</p>
<h3>Autumn Night</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Autumn night, dark autumn night, terrifying autumn night. The sky is terribly dark, fortunately, a round and bright moon rises in the east, and a few eerie stars are inlaid in the sky, eliminating the demons of darkness.</p>
<p>Gusts of chilling autumn wind blow on the tall plane trees, and pieces of yellow leaves struggle tremblingly in the autumn wind. Finally, they fall down, along with the branches and leaves, and are trampled into the ground.</p>
<p>Among the one or two weeping willows, there are a few beautiful maple trees. The light green willow leaves are interspersed with vermilion maple leaves, which are green and red, and in the bright moonlight, they look like a youthful girl with a thin layer of powder on her face, how beautiful! How lovely!</p>
<p>At the foot of the wall, in the rubble, there is the sad chirping of autumn insects, mourning the arrival of autumn, and also mourning their own lives, which are about to disappear.</p>
<p>On rainy autumn nights, a little autumn rain hits the verdant and broad banana leaves, the sound is like the wailing of the poor. Raindrops fall from the leaves, drop by drop, like the tears of a sentimental person.</p>
<p>The sad chirping of autumn insects, mixed with the sound of autumn rain, how beautiful! How desolate!</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, cruel winter is about to arrive, how will the poor live their miserable lives! Alas! I can't bear to think about it.</p>
<h3>Children's Science Lecture: Food</h3>
<p>— Linyin</p>
<p>Last time we talked about the raw materials for clothing, now let's talk about the issue of [food], which is as important as clothing. When children are hungry, they need to eat and drink. If they don't eat for a few days, they will die. But which are our main food sources?</p>
<p>Children will definitely answer: [The rice we eat at every meal.] Yes, rice is the main food that we southerners often eat. It is the fruit of rice (Figure 1). After the rice grows, the husks are removed, the husks are ground off, and the chaff is removed to become white rice. However, in the north, rice is not the main food. Do children know what northerners like to eat? Northern children all know to answer: [We like to eat [steamed buns].] Yes, northerners take wheat as their main food. There are two kinds of wheat, barley and wheat (Figure 2). The common food is wheat.</p>
<p>However, in another area, the production of rice and wheat is very small. So they use sorghum, pearl millet (corn), and sweet potatoes as food (Figures 3 and 4).</p>
<p>Do children know why everyone takes these green-leafed plants as their main food? This is because green leaves produce starch and fiber. The nutrients needed by humans are protein, fat, starch, minerals, and water, and starch accounts for an important part. Like rice, wheat, sorghum, sweet potatoes... all contain important starch (Figure 5). So people take them as their main food. However, starch is formed by the aggregation of extremely fine particles, and the outside of the particles is covered with a strong film, which is not easy to dissolve. After being cooked, the film is broken and dissolved in water. Especially when mixed with saliva, it becomes sugar and is easy to digest. Therefore, when eating, you must chew carefully to make the starch mix closely with saliva and quickly turn into sugar.</p>
<p>In addition to starchy foods, other foods containing protein, fat, etc., such as meat, fish, eggs... (Figure 6) are also essential for life. Therefore, if we do not take in a sufficient amount of suitable food, we are prone to malnutrition.</p>
<h3>Little Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Ganchuo</p>
<p>1. How to avoid the danger of electric shock</p>
<p>Whenever there is a thunderstorm, in order to avoid the danger of electric shock, we should not get close to objects that easily conduct electricity, such as stoves, walls, water pipes, etc. If you are outdoors, you should not stand in a high place, and you should not stand under a big tree.</p>
<p>2. Precautions before sleep</p>
<p>After finishing work every day, you should have adequate sleep so that you will have the energy to do things the next day. Therefore, we must pay attention to sleep. Before going to sleep, do not read or work excessively, and you should not read in bed (because this is harmful to your eyesight). Do not lie on your back when sleeping, otherwise you will often have nightmares. Because the heart and stomach are on the left side of the body, it is best to sleep on your right side.</p>
<h3>Birds that are our Friends</h3>
<p>— Ni Heng</p>
<p>The southern part of the United States has always been famous for cotton production. There are more than sixty kinds of birds there that specialize in eating pests in cotton fields. A horned lark eats at least thirty or forty pests per meal! So there, birds help farmers recover a lot of money!</p>
<p>Whenever we hear the crows crowing, [caw caw caw], we feel very annoyed. When we look up, we see their black feathers, which make us even more unhappy. However, we don't know that they are actually a very useful beneficial bird. It eats at least thirty grasshoppers per meal! The appetite of a flock of birds is so considerable! I don't know how many grasshoppers they eat!</p>
<p>The lovely cuckoo can eat forty caterpillars at a time, which is so refreshing! Someone dissected a cuckoo's stomach and found more than two hundred caterpillars! Children, think about it, it is such a good friend to us humans.</p>
<p>Two owls can eat four hundred mice and thirty large rats every year. Sometimes they even eat six shrews! Children, do you think these beneficial birds are worthy of praise and worthy of being our good friends?</p>
<p>May you treat your enemies like these birds treat pests!</p>
<h3>Fairy Tale</h3>
<p>— Written by Ms. Qin Qianpei</p>
<p>1. Brother Pig drove out for a ride, and ran into Brother Dog on the road. 2. He drove his fast car triumphantly and almost knocked Brother Dog down. 3. Although Brother Pig was driving a special fast car, he did not recognize the road ahead, and drove his car straight into the river. Brother Dog happily danced and said: You are wearing blue glasses!</p>
<h3>Chicken, Dog, and Cat</h3>
<p>— Cao Meiying, a student in the second grade of Wanzhu Primary School</p>
<p>My dad often gives me the Children's Weekly to read. I find it very interesting, so I wrote an article about the three things in my home, chickens, dogs, and cats, all of which are beneficial to people. I advise the children to do beneficial things.</p>
<p>The rooster crows and tells the time. He crows early in the morning and urges me to get up and go to school.</p>
<p>A dog guards the door, barking "Woof, woof," so that the little thieves dare not come to steal.</p>
<p>A little cat meows, "Meow, meow," so that the mice don't bite my little schoolbag.</p>
<p>Chickens can tell the time, dogs can guard the night, and cats can catch mice. They are all useful things. Children should be diligent, thrifty, and study hard to be good citizens and good children.</p>
<h3>The Life of German Children</h3>
<p>— Jingsheng</p>
<p>German children love to travel. They travel at least once a week. When they travel, they all run on foot and do not take cars.</p>
<p>Every Saturday afternoon, they automatically organize many small tour groups to prepare for traveling on Sunday. This tour group has a special name called "Wanderbirds." Some are groups of three or five children, and some are groups of seven or eight children. Each group has a captain who manages meals and exchanges everyone's opinions. They are all free to participate. They can live in the wild on Sundays, appreciate the scenery of the wild, absorb fresh air, and practice independent life in the wild, which is of great benefit to their body and mind. Therefore, Germans are very smart and have very good bodies. This is all cultivated in childhood!</p>
<p>Children! The weather is very good now. We may also take advantage of Sunday to learn the German children's "Wanderbird" method, and automatically organize some small groups to go out for a trip. This is such a happy and beneficial thing!</p>
<h3>Cartesian Diver</h3>
<p>— Shenshen</p>
<p>Children, we can use science to make many interesting and simple toys. The following one is made according to the principle of [air pressure].</p>
<p>Take an egg, break the smaller end of it, and let the yolk and egg white inside flow out together. Then, make two small holes in the edge of the broken opening and hang a small stone with a string. You can draw a human face on the eggshell at will. (As shown in Figure 1) This is done.</p>
<p>How to play? Just take a wide-mouthed bottle, pour clear water into the bottle, about eight minutes full, put the eggshell with the human face and the small stone hanging on it into the bottle — the head should be exposed above the water, and the amount of water should be increased or decreased accordingly. Put a rubber ball on the mouth of the bottle. If you press the ball with your hand, the human face eggshell will sink down completely; if you let go, it will be able to float up again. So it is called [Cartesian Diver].</p>
<p>Why is this happening? The reason is: because when you press the ball with your hand, the ball surface is embedded in the bottle, the air inside the eggshell is compressed, the volume is reduced, and the buoyancy is also reduced, so it sinks. When you let go, the ball returns to its original shape, the volume of air inside the eggshell increases, so it floats up again.</p>

<h3>Changes to Men's Basketball Rules for 1924-1935 (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Announced by the National Sports Association</p>

It should be able to stop the ball temporarily after it falls in.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, Article 1: The size of the ball has been slightly changed. If the circumference of the ball used in the game is less than 29 and a half inches when inflated to 13 pounds of pressure, it is not up to standard. The full text is as follows: The ball shall be spherical, with a rubber bladder inside a leather case. The bladder shall be filled with air, with a circumference of 29 and a half to 30 and a quarter inches. The weight shall be 20 to 22 ounces. The above regulations must be met when the ball is inflated to 13 pounds of pressure.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, Article 2: Team rosters must be submitted to the scorekeeper for registration two minutes before the start of the game. The second sentence is revised as follows: The names, numbers, and positions of the players participating in the game shall be submitted to the scorekeeper for registration two minutes before the scheduled game time. If this procedure is not completed by then, except in circumstances deemed unavoidable by the referee, it shall constitute a technical foul.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, Article 3: The following new sentence is added at the end: If a substitute player enters the game at the beginning of the second half, it is not necessary to report to the referee, but must register with the scorekeeper.</p>

The color of the numbers shall be distinctly different from the color of the jersey. The numbers on the back shall be at least 6 inches high, and those on the chest shall be at least 4 inches high. Players' numbers should avoid the numbers 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, Articles 1 to 11: Completely revised for the application of the dual referee system. The referee and the umpire are both game officials, and the timekeeper and scorekeeper are their assistants. Except for the duties exclusive to the referee as described in Articles 3, 3, and 4, the referee and umpire have equal authority and are not ranked above or below each other. The full text is as follows: Article 1: One referee and one umpire are the game officials, and two timekeepers and two scorekeepers are their assistants.

Article 7: Officials may call a timeout for injured players. If a player is injured while the game is in progress, the officials shall announce a timeout only after the game has ended. The game is considered to have ended when the team with the ball has thrown the ball towards the basket, or the ball has been lost, or the shot is unsuccessful, or a jump ball occurs, or the ball goes out of bounds. Article 8: Officials may consider improper conduct by players, coaches, or spectators as a foul and impose a penalty. Players with egregious misconduct may be immediately disqualified. Article 9: The referee or umpire shall not criticize each other's judgments within their respective jurisdictions. If a player is called for a foul but the penalty assessed is different, the more severe penalty shall be enforced. However, the mutual foul in Chapter 7, Article 16 does not apply to this provision. Article 10: Officials have the right to judge violations of the rules by players, whether on or off the court, from the beginning to the end of the game (including timeouts). There is no limit to the number of fouls that can be penalized if more than one player commits a foul. Article 11: When officials call a foul, they shall point out the player who committed the foul.

<h3>Eastern China's Strong Enemy, Inverness, Plays Western Police Today</h3>
<p>A Three-Way Contest: Let's See Who Can Unify</p>
<p>You You Replays the Skota Cup Match Against the Jewish Team</p>
<p>The Li Ji Western Union Football League has only been underway for a month and a half, which is not enough time to gauge future trends. However, based on the strength of each team, both Eastern China and Inverness have won every game and have never been defeated. Western Police only lost to Eastern China once when they were initially disorganized. Since then, their lineup has become increasingly complete. Last week, they defeated the defending champion Law and Business School by a score of 7-3, showing their strong momentum. In the future, they will definitely achieve great things. Initially, Harkis played for Inverness as a substitute and achieved excellent results for Inverness. Now that the Law team has been transferred to Dalian, Inverness has come to Shanghai. It is said that his football skills are no less than Harkis'. From this perspective, Eastern China, Western Police, and Inverness have become the Wei, Shu, and Wu of this season's Group A. Who can unify the three will be difficult to say at this early stage. Today, Inverness will play against Western Police for the first time at the Racecourse. Although this game has nothing to do with the Chinese, the strength of the two teams is significant and important to Eastern China, so it is worth paying attention to. One is to get a glimpse of Inverness's true skills, and the other is to determine the future situation. In addition to this game, You You will replay the Skota Cup against the Jewish team at the Yiyuan Garden. The previous game between the two teams ended in a 5-5 draw. Hopefully, You You will play with all their strength today. Today's games are as follows:</p>
<p>You You Club vs. Jewish, Cup Match, Yiyuan Garden, Botuo</p>
<p>Inverness vs. Western Police, Group A, Racecourse, Marshall</p>
<p>Eastern China B vs. Military Medical, Group C, Shenyuan, Malies</p>

<h3>Eastern China Overcomes Western Business</h3>
<p>A Comfortable 6-2 Victory</p>
<p>Relaxed Performance and Situation</p>
<p>The Eastern China football team played against the old and weak Western Business team yesterday at Yiyuan Garden in the Western Union Group A match. Both teams were relaxed, and the game was uneventful. The Eastern China players were mostly handsome young men. The forwards passed well and shot accurately, like a storm sweeping away fallen leaves. Western Business suffered a crushing defeat of 2-6. The audience was three or four thousand people, but the situation is declining, and the grand occasion is no longer there. The football competition, which used to attract the most spectators, is now much less interesting than before. The main reason is the lack of talent and the absence of up-and-coming players.</p>
<p>Reduced Performance</p>
<p>Since Li Yichen of Eastern China was suspended for two weeks, the team first faced the Jewish team and then the Western Business team, so they were not worried. They still maintained their status as a winning team. Yesterday, Li Ning and Youliang were also unable to play due to illness, and Fu Zhibin and Xu Jingcheng from Group B were used instead. As newcomers, their performance was satisfactory. As a whole, the team was certainly not as good as before, but because the enemy was weak, they solved the problem easily. They took the lead with 2-0 in the first half and won 4-2 in the second half, for a total of 6-1. However, there was a rain shower yesterday morning, and the field was too wet, making it difficult to run and easy to fall.</p>
<p>A Small Test of Strength</p>
<p>Both teams were cautious in the first half, advancing and retreating. After a long time, the five forwards of Western Business advanced together and suddenly entered the Eastern China territory. Stok passed the ball to Heidson, who shot. The ball was flat and fast, but fortunately, it was one foot off the goal and did not cause any harm. The mainland sent the ball out, and Dai Zhongjun instructed Cao Qiuting to attack the goal. The ball was as fast as an arrow, but the angle was slightly off and did not materialize. After 35 minutes, the record was very difficult to produce. Hong Guang passed to Feng Yunyou, then to Xiao Wan, and Xifo shot. The situation was critical. Qiuting dribbled the ball straight into the enemy's goal. The goalkeeper panicked and came to meet him, but Cao lightly passed him and put the ball into the net.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Gate Opens Again</p>
<p>After the record was broken, the spectators were elated and overjoyed. Fu Zhibin was active on the wing, and Bogeis could not stop him. Stok, due to his position, had the will but not the strength. Seeing the ball reach the center, A Dai attacked fiercely, but it was rebounded by the wooden post. Macro was shocked and lost the ball. Jia Qiu arrived just in time and sent the ball into the enemy's goal. After that, they came and went for a short time, and the whistle sounded for a break.</p>
<p>A Thousand Miles</p>
<p>The second half was tense. The Eastern China forwards took an absolute offensive posture, and the Western defenders were in crisis, in imminent danger. Stok worked hard and saved the most balls. Larson seized the opportunity, passed three levels in a row, and crossed the ball low. Sinclair headed the ball, almost breaking the gate. Xiao Wan returned to the counterattack and passed into the middle. Qiu passed to the front of the goal, and A Dai headed it into the net. After that, the Westerners became more and more hopeless. Xiao Wan threw the ball out of bounds, and Jia Qiu dribbled the ball to a wonderful spot and made another contribution. Without much time, Xiao Cao went on a solo mission and celebrated his victory. Godekin was flustered and did not know what to do. Jia Qiu's long shot made it 6-0, a huge number.</p>
<p>Fighting Back</p>
<p>"Do not be discouraged by defeat and do not be arrogant by victory" is indeed the motto of the military. After Eastern China won six goals in a row, the entire army seemed to have a laissez-faire attitude. On the other hand, the Westerners, like trapped beasts, made a desperate counterattack. Larson dribbled low, and Xin Ke got a goal. Soon, the right wing Larson revisited the old place. Sinclair immediately broke free from Guan Xinan's shackles, ran out of the fence, and jumped up to head the ball. Gu and Guan came to snatch the ball together, but Xin used a very agile dodging method, rotated slightly, and got a chance to shoot. Although Lei Lu patted it, the ball was still fast and went into the net, making the score 6-2 and ending the game.</p>

<h3>Zhang Shaolin, Chen Boming, and Others Initiate an Aerial Education Plan</h3>
<p>Divided into Higher Education and Primary Education Types</p>
<p>Using Broadcasting and Boming Notations as Tools</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Shaolin, initiator and chairman of the China Popular Education Assistance Association, recently left the association and, together with Mr. Chen Boming, inventor of Boming notations, plans to use aerial education to promote popular education. Yesterday, Mr. Zhang informed a Shanghai news reporter of the following plan for its establishment:</p>
<p>Broadcast education is the only tool for popular education. Aerial education uses broadcasting to promote education. The method is quite simple, requiring only a few pronunciation recordings by experts and a few broadcasting stations for pronunciation. Each station will focus on one subject. Experts will be invited to record the pronunciations, which will then be distributed to the stations. Students with financial means can study at home behind closed doors, while poor students can listen at designated locations provided by the stations. At the same time, experts will be invited to compile and print lecture notes for distribution to the students.</p>
<p>The examination method will imitate the British degree examination system. Before the formal examination, each student will take a general examination in subjects such as Chinese, English, and mathematics. Only those who pass the general examination can participate in the formal examination. Those who fail the general examination will not be allowed to participate in the formal examination. The formal examination must test a subject from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Boming notations will be used for primary education. In the primary education aspect, Boming notations invented by Mr. Chen Boming will be used as the tool for promotion, because this notation system is quite simple and particularly helpful for literacy education.</p>

<h3>Welcome to the Returning Representatives of Women's Groups</h3>
<p>— Qin Yi</p>
<p>In this unfortunate society where the imprisonment of women has become a habit, the petitioning representatives of various women's groups actually stood in front of the Central Political Conference of the highest government office in the capital, facing that high, thick wall, enduring the bleak west wind, and suffering the ridicule of the vulgar, determined to meet with the Central Committee members. This kind of courage can put to shame those warriors who retreat at the front lines. Common people have always feared officials, and moreover, you are women, seeing high officials. This kind of heroic spirit can invigorate us! Many people achieve success and benefit themselves, their families, or a village or district. But what you are fighting for is the law of equal rights for men and women. If successful, the benefit will be to two hundred million women; or even a reasonable nation due to equality between men and women, then the benefit will be to four hundred million people in the country. Hard work is certainly hard work, but high achievements can also be called high achievements!</p>
<p>However, law is empty words, and economics is the substance. Truly equal rights for men and women cannot be achieved merely by legal provisions. What is most important is the following work:</p>
<p>1. Encourage women to integrate into society and seize occupational and economic rights.</p>
<p>2. Persuade women to break away from the slavish nature of dependence, depravity, vanity, and extravagance.</p>
<p>3. Imply that women must develop a spirit of endurance and competent skills in order to be qualified for their occupations.</p>
<p>4. Transform the thoughts, habits, systems, etc., that hinder the liberation of women.</p>
<p>This work cannot be accomplished in a day or two. The celebration of victory is still in the distant future. Since you representatives have undertaken the struggle for legal equality in the front, you must also lead women to the economic and occupational battles in the rear, so as not to have a beginning without an end, and be accused of focusing only on the superficial. Then the women of our country will benefit greatly. With a sincere heart, I wish you a safe return and hope that you will work with us on the ground to liberate women, and I wish you good health!</p>
<h3>Pointing Out the Way</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>I happened to see on the [Social Service] section, [Answering Letters] column of a certain newspaper used for wrapping things, Miss XX asked:</p>
<p>[Should women of today still return to the family? Or should they go into society? This question revolves in my mind every day. What should I do, sir?]</p>
<p>The editor's answer was:</p>
<p>[Women and men are both the backbone of society, but women returning to the family is the first step for them to go into society. Ladies should recognize this point and regard it as two sides of the same coin, and should not see it as a [contradictory] silver lining.]</p>
<p>I sympathize with Miss XX. Because: when just touching the edge of the progressive movement and beginning to step on the threshold of society, suddenly having to heed this reverse call, the confusion, hesitation, and lack of direction are all in order. I know that Miss XX's indecision actually represents the mentality of a large number of educated women.</p>
<p>But I am not satisfied with the editor's reply. Because: he not only failed to thoroughly and clearly indicate the content of the issue, but instead vaguely concealed the distortion of the [return home movement] itself. Saying it is serving society, won’t such service only make the already murky society even darker?</p>
<p>The main points of the women's return home movement, as declared by its inventor (?), the German leader Hitler, and his court scholar, Wengel, are nothing more than: one, a virtuous wife and good mother is the highest ideal for women; and the nation is the nation of men. Two, abolishing professional women is enough to help unemployed men. The absurdity and far-fetchedness of this argument, its lack of social basis, and the real goal in its bones of dispersing the social dynamics of the united front have been repeatedly discussed in various valuable women's publications. There seems to be no need for me to say more here.</p>
<p>What I am dissatisfied with in this writing editor and want to correct and expose is: first, his [contradiction] saying; second, his smoke screen tactics.</p>
<p>Consider: since it is acknowledged that women, like men, are the backbone of society, why not allow them to support this society together with men, but instead drive them back from positions of proven excellence to the small world—the family—to specialize in bearing and raising children? Under the current system, the family does seem to be the starting point of society: but in terms of progressive principles, its scope will gradually shrink until it is finally equal to a bed. Born as modern people, besides striving to make all life increasingly socialized and public, what need is there to cling to this narrow cage? Naturally, there is no reason to go back, especially to say comically that going back is the first step towards society. It is clearly to separate men and women into different worlds, but says they are [both the backbone of society]; it is clearly pulling them backwards, but says it is the [first step] forward. This strange statement is too contradictory to be laughable.</p>
<p>Consider again: the intention of that [editor] is clearly to agree with and support the imported advocacy and action, but even Hitler himself and his courtier Wengel still partially and bluntly reveal their ulterior motives and intentions, so that listeners can directly recognize their meaning. But the [editor] deliberately mystifies it to confuse everyone's sight and hearing. Moreover, the more solemnly he wants others to [recognize], the more he uses this to cover up the distortion of the essence of the issue, so that you will unknowingly be tricked into the trap. As soon as you get home, immediately close the door and lock it, and don't even think about crossing the line again in the [first step]. This is truly a smoke screen effect that is so ingenious and so illusory.</p>
<p>Of course, such a distorted saying is not enough to deceive forward-looking women with clear eyes. On the contrary, they can expose it even more. However, forward-looking women are only a minority of the minority. Most educated women, especially like Miss XX, fall into the trap and are not even aware that they have been fooled. (Taking the 20,000+ sales of a certain newspaper daily as an example, the transmission of a lightly sketched poison prescription probably reaches no less than four or five times the number of sales!) Here, in addition to wishing everyone to be careful and guard against the danger of losing their footing at any time, we especially hope that forward-looking women will spare no effort to do the work of dispelling illusions and exposing pitfalls! —In Hangzhou</p>
<h3>The Issue of Keeping Maids</h3>
<p>— Kuang Jianping</p>
<p>Opposing the issue of keeping maids has been discussed frequently for a long time, especially for those who pay attention to the women's movement in the South. No one is unaware of it. Until now, it has already been implemented in Hong Kong. It is a kind of registration and ban method. Now I will briefly describe the registration and ban method of the anti-maid-keeping movement in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Registration and ban is a chronic ban method. It is the same as the plan of gradual elimination. That is, restricting the increase in registration, making each maid-keeping household register every year, comparing this year with last year, there has been a decrease. The next method is the issue of [retaining] and [releasing]. [Releasing] means returning the maid to her parents unconditionally; and the [retaining] method is to give wages uniformly, and can only be treated as a servant, not as a slave. This method is originally a safe method, but if we examine the facts in more depth, it is not a thorough method. For example, although the government sets up customs to collect taxes and sends many people to check the customs, there are still many people smuggling. Similarly, there will also be people who keep maids without reporting, and what is more, people who keep maids must be wealthy.</p>
<p>Most of the people who keep maids are women in large families. For example, older married women often buy young girls to be maids for their own comfort. And some are newly married women who bring maids with them as dowry according to feudal customs. Therefore, the murderers of frail and young maids, in addition to the general inhumane men, the mistresses and ladies who keep maids should also bear some responsibility. Regarding the maid-keeping situation, let me first talk about what I have witnessed in Guangzhou. In Guangzhou, it is common in large families near Xiguan. Almost every room is assigned a maid to manage it, as many as the workers in a large organization. Their duties, of course, are the things that the mistress, ladies, masters, and guests order them to do.</p>
<p>The maid-keeping system was originally a slave system in feudal society. It is also like the black slave system in the United States in the past, only knowing to be subject to the master's servitude, obeying all the master's reasonable and unreasonable matters. Because it is a passive nature, there is originally no free action. What is the difference between a person without freedom and livestock? The United States, which loves freedom, felt that the black slave system deprived the blacks of the right of [man], and also had Lincoln's advocacy of the emancipation of slaves movement, even if it caused the civil war between the North and the South, it was not a pity. What is more, in our China, the masters of maids will not think that maids are not only human, but also our compatriots. The only difference is that the masters have money, and the maids are sold because of poverty. Therefore, whether they are female compatriots participating in the women's movement, or male compatriots who are not participating in the women's movement, they should also stand up to help mankind fight for the rights of mankind, to overthrow this slave system of feudal society, because those who are enslaved are not only maids among the female compatriots, but also many male compatriots who are dying inhumanly.</p>
<p>Let's get back to the point, we have to investigate further to see the pain suffered by the maids. In addition to the abuse by the masters mentioned above, there is also a more unbearable deprivation. This is the male master's rape. This is not a lie, and it is not a strange thing. A male master, because of a momentary impulse, uses the authority of the master and the magic of money to sacrifice a woman's life. The master's actions towards the maid are even more common. If she is lucky, she will become another kind of oppressed concubine; if she encounters a more tragic situation, her life will be over.</p>
<p>The inhumane treatment of maids, as far as I know, is as described above. Therefore, we can discuss the methods of the anti-maid-keeping movement.</p>
<p>Based on the chronic ban method to ban the maid system, no matter what, I believe that the effect must not be great. Because the registration method cannot be perfect, and the issue of [retaining] and [releasing] is even more out of the question. For example, let's talk about [releasing] first. Returning the maid to her original parents for unconditional receipt. This is not an easy method to talk about. The parents who sell their daughter as a maid are definitely not rich, this is the inevitable reason. When she was young, she was sold, and after so many years, whether the original parents are still alive is also a question. Furthermore, whether the original parents can maintain their original life after taking her back is even more of a question. Therefore, judging from the universality of the matter, returning a method is really not very feasible. Because if we cannot solve this group of unemployed women who cannot make a living, wouldn't it be counterproductive? Secondly, the issue of [retaining], since it has become a wage-based nature, then when there are so many unemployed women now, will the masters willingly take out money to pay wages and continue to hire this group of slaves whom they can usually control freely; what's more, this group of women has come through the liberation movement, it is inevitable that the masters hate them, anyway, they have money and don't worry about not having servants now, maids who have gone through the liberation movement are at any time in danger of being fired. After being fired, they can only squeeze into the ranks of the unemployed. In this way, the result of the movement becomes an increase in the number of unemployed people, and it backfires.</p>
<p>The importance of a liberation movement lies in the fact that the effect after liberation is beneficial. And a non-beneficial liberation movement is just an empty check, which instead involves the disaster of the liberated people. Therefore, the women's movement in recent years that has broken away from the group movement of social movement is really not a method. We who are doing the women's movement are also a department of the social movement, so we should take a liaising attitude, join hands with social movement people, and use the power of the group to attack the old forces of the feudal system. This is a thorough and active method.</p>
<h3>A Corner of Parisian Women's Life</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Paris's prosperity is second to none among all modern metropolises. Not to mention those clothes with the latest styles, which are constantly new and innovative there, and the various hairstyles in the barber shops, as well as the exquisite and elaborate perfume bottles, even if we don't smell the fragrance, just standing by the counter and looking at them will make our eyes burn uncontrollably. But because we only have enough money to eat in our pockets, we suppress the thought of buying them. On the other hand, the world's culture, art, and new trends of thought, literature, sculpture, books, music, and even science and practical industry, are all ahead of others, or on par with other civilized European countries! Wonderful Paris! Mysterious Paris!</p>
<p>All metropolises have become globalized, and Paris is even more globalized. Wealthy American merchants, Italian rascals, Jewish thieves, Annamite soldiers... it's a department store that encompasses everything. Under this situation, there is one thing that does not attract special attention, but everyone understands it, that is, the number of prostitutes in Paris is increasing year by year.</p>
<p>France's regulations on female prostitution are very clever. Of course, the police station collects extremely heavy taxes, and they also have to undergo an examination once a month to see if they have any infectious diseases, to allow them to continue prostitution or not. However, under this situation, those female students who have studied at universities or graduated from universities are also very willing to take the path of prostitution when they cannot find a proper job. Speaking of which, France is open to occupations, but the content is quite different. The treatment of male and female workers is still unequal. For the same work per hour, men can get one yuan, but female workers have to cut it in half. And in poor France, the number of unemployed male workers is naturally more indifferent to the female side. This is a natural phenomenon in their male-centered society!</p>
<p>Even in this prosperous city, try to pay attention to the tunnels by the Seine, you would simply think that the poor unemployed people who are sleeping motionless are already dead! —In France, it is not allowed to sleep on the streets. —It seems that in the most lively and incredible Paris nightlife, drinking a cup of coffee can cost hundreds of pounds. In addition to prostitutes, customers, and tourists, there are old women with yellow and haggard faces standing in the dark corners of the streets. They are holding newspapers and shouting to sell them, but at the same time, they are also beggars. Right on the straight street of the University of Paris, when I was studying there, I encountered it more than once on my way back from the restaurant: "Excuse me! Miss." It was a woman's voice. I turned my head and looked, thinking it was someone asking for directions, but I didn't know they were asking me for money. At that time, I was a person who wanted to study but was forced by economic hardship, so I naturally had to answer her with a "Excuse me." Leaving Paris and going to the suburbs, like Laplace, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Cachan, etc. villages, almost most of them are workers, among whom only a very few can be considered petty bourgeois families, and there are also many dilapidated and unclean wooden houses, which are almost the same as the cowsheds and toilets in China.</p>
<p>The women I usually meet the most are the ticket collectors on trams, the waitresses in cafes, the laundry women, the maids who clean the rooms, the hotel waiters, and the waiters in theaters and cinemas. Their daily income is only enough to barely maintain their lives, and sometimes it is not enough. For example, the waitresses in hotels, each of them is assigned to serve nearly ten tables with four seats, but those seats are not always completely full. The small tips given are one percent, and most of the people who eat in that kind of small hotel are students, who at most eat six or seven francs, so they only give them sixty centimes. The maids who clean the rooms also get one percent—some are also hired by the hotel at a salary. A traveler who pays 300 francs for a room gives the maid who cleans the room 30 francs, but they have to make your bed and wipe the floor every day, and so on. If a hostel has forty or fifty rooms, and there are two maids to clean the rooms, they are busy enough from morning to night all day, and there is never a time to rest. In the several hostels I have stayed in, none of the maids who cleaned the rooms did not complain to me.</p>
<p>In short, the inside story of the lives of Parisian women is unbelievable to hear.</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>I remember those days last month when the fine, lingering rain was falling. The thin, angular egg seller who came to our neighborhood almost every day suddenly disappeared for several days. This was a puzzle to me, as I thought even with the rain, she wouldn't take a break just for that reason. But the people living in the same courtyard thought she was afraid of the mud in this small alley. I thought to myself, that's also a possibility. Her visits were as rare as the sun on a moldy, rainy day, and only then would there be business.</p>
<p>The evening of the second day after the rain cleared, as I returned from outside, the woman was already in the courtyard, making her deals.</p>
<p>"Long time no see! You!" Her yellowish-green face smiled, as if seeing a long-lost friend.</p>
<p>"People in this courtyard were worried about you. What happened, taking a break?"</p>
<p>"My foot is still raised up!" Quiet Girl, picking through the eggs, interjected.</p>
<p>"Really, so easy to take a break? The first day of the rain, I twisted my foot in the deep mud," she stretched out her left leg, "It's still swollen. That day, my ankle and toes were all puffed up like a big tumor, all because I was dodging a car!"</p>
<p>"Didn't you apply plaster?"</p>
<p>She kept saying she did apply it, but feared it might not heal completely. Leaving her carrying pole at my doorway, I led her inside to get her egg money. Stroking her leg, which was constantly throbbing, she asked me to write a letter to her husband, who was a soldier in the military camp.</p>
<p>She knew the place name and her husband's name very well. She watched me take out the good paper and pen, resting her hand on the corner of the table, smiling:</p>
<p>"Tell him I'm injured. Usually, I know he has little money, so I don't push him, but this time it's a last resort!"</p>
<p>"About how much do you need?"</p>
<p>"Three or four dollars would be best, one or two would also be okay. Tell him, now it's a last resort. I've told our fifteen-year-old daughter to carry a basket all day to exchange for lamp oil. The scraps and toys she exchanges can also sell for ten or so coppers. The two of us, mother and daughter, won't starve for now, as long as we're not sick or injured."</p>
<p>I hurried to write, the woman's mouth chattering as fast as firecrackers.</p>
<p>"Anything else?"</p>
<p>Smiling slightly: "Nothing else. Just say that the egg business isn't doing so well. The costs are high, and if I sell them too expensive, people don't want them. Fortunately, there are always egg wholesalers to pick from. The price of money is getting higher and higher, and it might not even earn a dollar or two in ten days."</p>
<p>Finally, the woman took the letter and left, turning back to say:</p>
<p>"This is another three eggs to mail a letter!"</p>
<p>In the days that followed, the woman still came every day, the carrying pole, seemingly heavy at both ends, pressing on her thin shoulders, as if about to collapse. Her yellowish-green face was even more taut. Her red and purple hands trembled in the autumn wind.</p>
<p>People in the courtyard surrounded her, and I thought of that letter:</p>
<p>"Did your husband send money?"</p>
<p>Shrinking her nose: "No, I don't know if he spent it himself or if he's really poor, waiting for a dead man! My foot won't get better, so I'll just let it be. It's just that neither of us, mother and daughter, have winter coats yet. The girl is older and knows about the cold, always complaining that her exposed shoulders aren't proper, and it's really—"</p>
<p>As her long, gray shadow crossed the doorway, the people in the courtyard sighed:</p>
<p>"Look, she's limping even worse now."</p>
<p>Five days, ten days, half a month, she didn't come again. I don't know if the money came and she went to heal her foot, or if she's limping so badly she can't walk. Everyone missed her, regretting not having a few more dollars in their pockets, unable to learn from the humane philanthropists. But thinking about how incomplete this thought was, they sighed again.</p>
<p>Whenever there's a shout of "Exchange for lamp oil" at the door, I always run out to take a look, hoping there's a fifteen-year-old girl among them. But as I stare at each woman carrying a basket, I'm disappointed.</p>
<p>"Maybe that girl is sitting beside her sick mother with bare shoulders?" As I slowly walked through the door, I thought darkly.</p>
<h3>The Troubles of a Living Corpse</h3>
<p>— Jiu Gu</p>
<p>Luo Ying carefully wiped the snow cream, applied a thin layer of white powder, and felt the color was a bit pale. Last night's insomnia was so heavily etched on her face, she regretted it somewhat. Her lazy gaze shifted over the boxes of rouge on the table, from light to dark. She picked a box with a reddish hue, dabbed it on for a while, feeling somewhat satisfied. Then, she used a rose-colored rouge to evenly apply to her cheeks and lipstick to her lips, finally resting her right hand. Originally, the next step would be to draw her eyebrows, but this was a great annoyance. Her eyebrows had long been plucked clean at the roots, so she couldn't help but draw them. However, the form she drew them in lately was always like a goblin. Needless to say, it couldn't compare to the light and charming style of Lianfang, not even as pretty as her own original white eyebrows.</p>
<p>She wasn't in a rush to draw her eyebrows, but first poured some fragrant oil on her permed hair, combing the waves until they were shining. Then, she opened the collar of her pajamas a little. Gazing at the "Mona Lisa" by Da Vinci on the wall, she felt she resembled her somewhat, so she smiled slightly. Rushing to draw two willow eyebrows within that smiling face, the length was just right, the darkness was just right. Today was truly a masterpiece! Zi Chang once said to her, this mouth alone, which seemed to smile and yet not smile, had great strength. Later, he had a flock of white pigeons flying lightly up and down, and within that beautiful, misty atmosphere, he finally managed to paint it. Thinking of this, she "hmph-ed" to herself, thinking that Da Vinci's art of creating emotion through scenery had been taken and put to practical use by her!</p>
<p>She looked at the image in the mirror—front, side, every angle, smiling face, sad face, all sorts of strange faces. Having such a beautiful and magical face, but only keeping it for herself to look at in the mirror, couldn't help but feel empty. Fortunately, this face belonged to her, so at least there was a beautiful reality within the emptiness, enough to comfort herself. Today, there were no appointments for outings or visits, just emptiness, so she boldly dressed up to enjoy the satisfaction. In the drawers were all newly made autumn clothes. At first, she put on a scarlet one, disliking its large patterns. Next, she put on a green one, disliking its horizontal stripes. For her voluptuous figure, it seemed to make her appear "Yang-fat." Later, she put on a beige one, the style and color were all good. Going out to the balcony to look at the clear sky, she felt that the blue clouds, the red leaves, and the clear water were most suited to this light-colored dress. Looking at her waist in the dressing mirror, looking at her legs, looking at her movement, looking at her stillness, looking at her standing, looking at her sitting, then returning to the dressing table. In the whole room, front, back, left, and right, there was only one person, only one person who could appreciate this "perfection," and that person was only herself. How lonely this was! Zi Chang, of course, was capable of aesthetic appreciation. He could paint such beautiful pictures, and talk about such deep and difficult art theories. Yet, the hateful thing was that he wouldn't allow me to decorate myself, wouldn't allow me to be aware that I was a beautiful woman. How monopolizing! He wasn't tyrannical to others, only towards me did he always oppose. What is there to say when a person has no emotions? The most unforgivable was that last time, he simply called me a "living corpse." How cruel!</p>
<p>So, she turned her gaze to the wall again, to the place she was most unwilling to look at, but now hated, a hate that could drive her in all directions. She stared intently at the wall, and faintly, she discovered those two lines again:</p>
<p>Seeking worries in stillness, disliking busyness in motion,</p>
<p>Wasting rice and grain in vain, squandering precious time.</p>
<p>She angrily took her handkerchief and rubbed and rubbed the words forcefully. They were already blurred, but as she sat in front of the dressing table, they were clearly reflected in her eyelids. This hateful "plague corpse"! Doesn't it eat rice and grain? Who doesn't seek worries? Moreover, I am a beautiful woman. A beautiful woman has the right to ask for some privileges! How can I be as "stupid" as him? Running, attending meetings, giving speeches, teaching snotty children to read... Heavens! Don't waste people!</p>
<p>Yet, Zi Chang happened to have such an appearance! How wonderful it would be if that appearance were on a soft-hearted person! Since he left, I haven't met anyone who is even half like him. And I am like a female peacock, mixed in with a flock of male chickens. Since you gave birth to me, of course you had to give birth to Zi Chang. Since you gave birth to Zi Chang, why did you have to give him that iron heart? How vast the universe is, preparing me to play this great tragedy of life?</p>
<p>Tears hung on her elaborately made-up face, one by one, string by string. Later, she crawled into bed, covering her face in the quilt, already shrouded in the twilight darkness.</p>

The overall situation was relatively stable, but the Central Bank continued to heavily sell U.S. dollars, gradually becoming exhausted. There was very little trading in the market, and the surface showed signs of dryness.

After opening, the Central Bank announced listed prices, with English and American both flat, and the customs gold unit was lower by 1 percent. The Central Bank heavily sold U.S. dollars, and the market immediately loosened. Banks were still buying, and Chinese merchants' sentiment was stable, so the situation was still supportable. HSBC Bank announced its listed exchange rates for English and American, also unchanged. The subsequent process was calm. The silver equalization tax was announced, with the English exchange rate calculated at one shilling five pence 4375, not listed. At this time, because the Central Bank still had a selling interest, the situation was very ordinary. Then, because of rumors that the Central Bank would ship a large batch of gold bars for export, market sentiment was boosted, and the market tightened slightly thereafter, but it was still unremarkable. By the time the near-term selling prices closed at noon, the English exchange rate was one shilling four pence 3125, the American exchange rate was 33.9375 yuan, compared to the previous close, the English was flat and the American was tight by 0625.

<h3>Call Loan Interest Yesterday Reached 18 Percent</h3>
<p>Since the resurgence of cash exports, the local foreign market has gradually become tense. Yesterday, the interbank call loan rate in the market topped 18 percent, an increase of 3 percent compared to the previous day. "Hua Tou" (a type of financial instrument) added water, initially at 9 percent, then at 11 percent, seemingly a drop of 5 or 6 percent compared to the previous day, but this was accidental and should not be taken as the norm. Call loan transactions in the early market were over 4.2 million, and transactions in the noon market were over 200,000. Transactions at the Small General Association were over 300,000. Foreign mortgage transactions involved withdrawals of over 600,000, and new transactions of over 1.8 million.

<h3>Securities: The Entirety Rises Six, The Upward Trend is Strong and Extraordinary</h3>
<p>Fierce Short Covering Washes Away Days of Weakness</p>
<p>All Bonds Rise Between Three and Five Cents to Around One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, stimulated by the rise of the Zheng Liu (a specific security), suddenly triggered a fierce short covering. The counter-wind suddenly rose, its force was very strong, and the long-suffering market situation finally saw a slight turnaround. Throughout the day, market sentiment was renewed. Although interbank lending continued to rise, it seemed to have no effect. Zheng Liu was still extremely popular. Although it briefly fell due to the settlement of the 78th, the closing price strengthened again. After this fluctuation, the interest in going long suddenly became strong. In addition, the selling out of the 78th was a profit-taking liquidation. The 70 yuan level was always maintained, so the future trend is expected to reach 72 to 73 yuan. Although these are speculative words, they cannot be called incoherent. During the morning trading, initially, due to the increase in foreign exchange interest rates, the 53rd and others continued to sell. The share price fell by three or four cents. Later, short covering surged, and the 35th absorbed a lot. The counter-wind rose suddenly, and the trend became stronger and stronger. The difference between the near-term and forward prices was as much as one and a half yuan. The forward contract rose sharply by seven cents due to high demand for delivery. The short side was particularly impatient, and also rose by seven cents. During the second session, the rising momentum became even stronger. The buying sentiment was extremely strong for a time, with many rising by seven or eight cents. Zheng Liu briefly fell by two or three cents due to the settlement of the 78th. The afternoon session was flat. As a result, the daily market price rebounded by 35 cents to about 1 yuan. The total turnover was 26.86 million yuan. Also, ten shares of stock. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the comparison table below (unit: yuan for 10,000, unit: 100 yuan for the stock position, unit: shares of stock)</p>
<h3>American Aviation Stocks Perform Particularly Well</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Trading Company's market report said that yesterday (the 16th), New York stock prices were mixed with fatigue, and aviation stocks were very strong due to rumors of transatlantic air mail delivery. Public utilities stocks showed weakness again, especially the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. One reason was that the government was about to investigate, and another was that there was talk of a reduction in the company's stock dividend on Wednesday, but well-informed people were skeptical of the latter statement. New Jersey Oil Company announced the redemption of 90 million 5% bonds, with a redemption price of 102 yuan plus interest. Oil stocks were very stable, and the underlying potential of the stock market was still optimistic. The bond market trended higher, and the stocks of small exchanges were sold off in large numbers and were loose. The total transaction volume for the day was 1.03 million shares.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants Continue to Dump Marked Yarn</h3>
<p>The Monthly Futures Reached the Eighty Yuan Mark</p>
<p>The yarn market remains sluggish due to the weakening condition of American cotton. Foreign merchants continue to dump their holdings, and the silver exchange rate has risen to 18 cents, causing market sentiment to loosen. At the same time, yarn sales are slightly sluggish. However, bullish interests, in a small organized effort, believe that for this month at least, insufficient deliveries will be required to maintain stability.</p>
<p>Gold Rooster Continues to Weaken</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened lower due to the poor performance of foreign cotton, and there was still debate whether buyers would take delivery this month. However, there were few buyers in the market, and prices for various months fell by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 cents. In the afternoon, spot yarn transactions were reported to be flat, and the current month's price fell below the 80 yuan mark. Third-round trading rebounded outside the 80 yuan mark, but weakened again at the close, with various months falling by 1, 2, and 4 cents. Total trading volume for the day was 30,100 bales. Sales included Tongji 1,300 bales, Dafu 1,000 bales, Dafeng 1,300 bales, Gengfeng 450 bales, Shenchang 400 bales, Yuande 550 bales, Renfeng 750 bales, Runkang 650 bales, Yongda 400 bales, and Mingde 650 bales, Changfeng 400 bales. Purchases included Tongxing 400 bales, 150 bales, Jinchang 1,700 bales, Mingde 500 bales, Changfeng 1,600 bales, and Yuande 550 bales.

<p>Spot Sales Reduced to 1,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still flat. According to statistics, all gangs bought a total of 1,000 bales throughout the day, with prices falling by 2.5 to 5 cents. The purchase amounts for each gang are as follows:</p>
<h3>Near-Month Cotton Belts Weaken</h3>
<p>The cotton market remains weak due to the poor performance of the American and Indian cotton markets. It is said that several thousand dan of coarse cotton will be delivered this month. Cotton mills need lower quality cotton, so the near-month market is slightly weak. However, buyers are holding firm on the far months, which are still relatively strong.</p>
<p>Zhengzhou [Cotton Futures] Shows Loosening</p>
<p>The marked cotton market opened lower, with market conditions quite weak due to the continued weakness of American and Indian cotton. Moreover, the near-month deliveries are dominated by Hankou coarse cotton, leading to a further loosening of the Zhengzhou market. Prices for all months fell by 2.5 cents. However, near the close, there was news that gold prices had risen slightly, suddenly rebounding higher. As a result, near months fell by 1.5 cents, and far months remained unchanged. The afternoon market remained flat, with the "He" month rising slightly by 5 cents. Total trading volume for the day was 67,700 dan. Sales included Yichang 3,000 dan, Junchang 2,200 dan, Yuanda 2,500 dan, Hengyi 900 dan, Yukang 900 dan, Yuda 1,200 dan, Yuande 1,100 dan, Renfeng 1,900 dan, Tongxing 900 dan, Changfeng 2,900 dan, Xianda 1,400 dan, Runkang 1,900 dan, and Ruiyuan 900 dan. Purchases included Junchang 1,000 dan, Xinxing 1,300 dan, Yuanxingchang 3,600 dan, Yifeng 2,900 dan, Tongji 1,000 dan, Shenchang 1,700 dan, Runkang 3,300 dan, and Dachang 1,900 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Factory Demand is Limited</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales remain sluggish, and factory demand is weak. The source of cotton is estimated to be 1,198 bales of Yao cotton and 980 bales of general cotton. Lingbao cotton from the Yufeng Factory is delivered to the factory as spot goods.</p>
<h3>Monthly Yarn and Cotton Settlement Scheduled</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Yarn and Cotton Exchange's November yarn and cotton settlement is scheduled for the 29th of this month. Yarn and cotton trading for this month will be suspended on the 26th, 27th, and 28th. All market trading will be suspended on the yarn and cotton settlement date. This has already been announced.</p>
<h3>Increased American Cotton Acreage Becoming a Near Reality</h3>
<p>A New York dispatch dated November 16 reported on the week's cotton market conditions, stating that cotton market trading this week was limited because people want to wait for the next year’s planting reports. The price fluctuations were narrow. At the beginning of the third week, prices rose due to news of gradually decreasing foreign cotton competition. It was heard that Liverpool had invested here and that there were also purchases due to increased demand for cotton cloth. However, there was some short selling in the South, and retail investors liquidated their positions, and the December contract was also liquidated. Jobbers purchased the December contract to hedge their far-month short sales. Spot market conditions were quite tight, so some cotton merchants are now said to be buying up existing licensed cotton stocks. A report from Washington that American cotton was being exchanged for German goods has attracted attention, but this news is not yet concrete and cannot sway market conditions. The calculation of next year’s cotton acreage is now generally awaited, but there is a widespread belief that the cotton market is now prepared for a slight increase in cotton acreage.</p>
<h3>Small Increase in Foreign Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was stagnant, and all traders adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Spot prices remained unchanged, and futures prices rose by 2 to 4 points. English cotton futures rose by 2 to 3 points. Indian cotton was firm due to purchases by Japanese and European exporters, with Pingguo rising by 2.5 cents and Omu and Bairoxi rising by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 16th).</p>
<h3>Grain and Flour Markets Exceedingly Weak</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened this morning, the market for various months was generally flat and weak. Canadian flour fell by 2 cents. When the prices opened, the intentions of people inside and outside the industry were not consistent. Some slightly compensated for the near term, while others continued to sell off the far term, and most believed that the market's short-selling tendency caused selling pressure to be quite strong for a time, and the market also saw a decline. When the afternoon prices opened, the current month's price opened as low as 3.5 cents, and the various far months also fell slightly by about a cent or so. However, after the second round of trading, it was heard that Fuxin slightly replenished its position for the current month, so the opening price became slightly stable again. For the far term, factories slightly sold off, so it remained flat. As a result, the current month fell by 2.25 cents compared to the previous day, December fell by 1.5 cents, January fell by 1 cent, February fell by 1.5 cents, March fell by 1 cent, and April fell by 1.5 cents.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened, the sentiment for the various months was generally calm. There was no smooth trading between buyers and sellers. However, regarding the pricing of spot foreign wheat, it was heard that Argentine wheat was still at 92 cents. There were no other reports. Moreover, because the environment for the flour market was unfavorable, it gradually declined slightly, so the wheat market was also very flat and weak. In the afternoon, in each round of trading, the near term remained weak, and the January and February terms were also initially weak. Later, because there were very few sellers and more buyers, it gradually rebounded. As a result, the current month fell by 3 cents, December fell by 2 cents, January fell by 1 cent, February rose by 1 cent, and March fell by 3 cents. The spot wheat market, because of the sharp decline in marked flour and wheat, quoted prices also fell by 3 to 5 cents. It was heard that Dongbai wheat was offered at 3.82 yuan, red wheat at 8 cents, Xuzhou wheat at 3.8 yuan, secondary grade at 79 cents, and Yaowan wheat at 3.79 yuan, with Fuxin taking 3,000 bags and Fufeng taking 2,000 bags.</p>
<p>The characteristic of the Chicago market is the firmness of corn. Forecasts of poor weather conditions pushed prices higher. It is said that rural prices are 2 to 5 cents higher than Chicago, and supply is very short.</p>
<h3>Wineries Also Handle Siamese Yuan Rice</h3>
<p>—Guest Grain and Spot Foreign Rice Both Decline—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot foreign rice market was very good, especially Siamese Yuan rice, which was actively sought after by local merchants. Even Shaoxing wineries were buying it. A total of 5,700 bags were traded throughout the day. It's rare to see Yuan rice being so popular. The initial price opened at 10.8 yuan, then rose from 11.85 yuan to 11.9 yuan, an increase of 10 cents on the day. Saigon rice was offered for sale by a group, with the price falling slightly by 5 cents. High-quality "Real Pagoda Brand" rice initially opened at 11.4 yuan and then fell to 11.35 yuan. Medium-quality Saigon rice was offered separately, totaling 1,350 bags. In addition, 1,100 bags of broken Saigon rice were purchased by local merchants, with a price of only 8.25 yuan. 200 bags of Annam glutinous rice also fell slightly by 3 to 5 cents. Futures trading was even. Yongda Company sold 500 tons for December delivery at a price of 5.05 yuan. Reclaimed cargo, together with road cargo, totaled 500 tons, which were all distributed to local merchants. Guest grain arrivals gradually increased, and 2,872 bags of guest hulled rice were traded, with prices falling slightly by a few cents to nearly 10 cents.</p>
<h3>Lower River Rice Market Drops Another 2 Cents</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were slightly more sources from various gangs, with more than 40 houses trading a total of more than 6,000 shi. Sales were sluggish due to heavy rain, and a downtrend began again. Bao Wei and other gangs from Yantai purchased more than 100 bags, and the situation seemed to be slightly improving. It is estimated that the late rice of each gang fell by just over a dime to two dimes, while the thick japonica rice fell by as much as two or three dimes. However, those with high-quality material can still hold on. Due to the influence of Guest Tip and foreign rice, Du Yang Tip was even more sluggish and sales were extremely slow, with prices falling by more than a dime. Only Yin Yuan is still holding strong due to strong demand from wineries and improved market appetite.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 22 shops arrived from the lower river area. All kinds of rice sales on the market, including new japonica, broken japonica, new glutinous rice, Du Tip rice, new Chenbu Guest Tip rice, and early thin rice, were all very sluggish. Chen Baiyuan and Yin Yuan were sluggish for small lot sales. Wineries were slightly active. The market for new japonica, broken new glutinous rice, Du Tip rice, new Chenbu Guest Tip rice, Chen Baiyuan, and Yin Yuan was flat and weak, and early thin rice fell by just under a dime.</p>
<h3>Yellow Soybeans Continue to Rise Via Telegram</h3>
<p>Yesterday, yellow soybeans continued to rise by 5 to 6 cents. Chen Soybean from Yingzhou opened at 3.39 yuan, large-grain soybean from Fanjiatun, Dalian, opened at 4 yuan, small-grain soybean from Kaiyuan opened at 3.75 yuan, and secondary soybean from Bengbu also opened at 3.05 yuan, so the market was filled with nervous voices. The trend is still seen as solid. The purchase appetite from Xichang and Zhejiang gangs remains unabated, and local factories are also still tight. Furthermore, Dalian telegrams reported that the soybean market continued to rise, so generally people are optimistic. Yesterday, the total city traded over 12,000 bags of various soybeans via truck transport.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Zhenmei Green Tea Sales to Europe Improve</h3>
<p>Since the various tea merchants sent out large batches of telegrams last week, the market for Tunxi Zhenmei green tea has been brewing a movement. Yesterday, most firms, including Xiangshang, Xiehe, Yihua, Jinlong, and Tongfu, started trading due to orders from abroad. Over 1,500 boxes were traded throughout the city, and trading was quite brisk. However, the sales price of 60 to 75 yuan was down by 2 to 3 yuan compared to before. In addition, there were also sporadic sales of Gongxi Zhenmei and other items, and the situation is gradually stabilizing.</p>

<h3>Knowledge and Labor</h3>
<p>—Zhiwen</p>
<p>Knowledge and labor are two inseparable processes of production. This is true for any era when viewed from the perspective of the material and spiritual production processes of society. Even in terms of the division of physical and mental labor in humanity's material and spiritual production, it is only at a certain stage in all of history that there is such a strict division. Although knowledge is a product of mental production, neither mental nor material production can exist without relying on labor, and the mental production process depends even more on the material production process. Therefore, labor becomes a necessary condition for all production, and knowledge cannot be separated from labor.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the evolutionary phenomenon of human society is that the process of material production and labor is the process of spiritual production and knowledge. It is obvious that without material labor and production, there would be no social knowledge or human spiritual civilization. Primitive humans, because their labor methods and production technologies were not developed, not only lacked knowledge of all sciences, philosophies, and even ordinary life common sense, but also could not develop thought and the language used to translate thought. Savages learned the function of fire through the production process of obtaining fire for burning objects and cooking. The knowledge of metallurgy and the manufacture of metal utensils was also obtained through the unforgettable experience of gradually improving stone tools into metal production tools. It is generally recognized by scholars that astronomical knowledge originated from the need for seasonal measurement in agriculture, and mathematical knowledge originated from the need for calculating livestock distribution, land allocation, and so on. Only in the process of human labor and production progress can the development of various kinds of knowledge be promoted. Therefore, the development of modern science is the result of the experience and demands of modern labor and production. Labor and production are the experience of the external world, and knowledge is the product of experience, so knowledge and labor are unified and inseparable.</p>
<p>In the ancient societies of humankind, labor was knowledge, and those with knowledge were also laborers. Because in that kind of society, everyone was busy with life and had no leisure to set aside time to seek knowledge. Moreover, the production capacity of each person could only maintain their own life. There was no surplus production to specifically feed a portion of people engaged in knowledge exploration. Therefore, there was no special class of knowledge. Laborers and knowledge workers, mental laborers and physical laborers, were completely unified at that time.</p>
<p>When the productive forces of society advanced and individuals had surplus production and the possibility of savings, laborers and those with knowledge, mental laborers and physical laborers, became clearly divided, forming a division of labor between labor and knowledge, mental labor and physical labor. In this kind of society where knowledge and labor are split and mental labor and physical labor are clearly distinguished as different social strata, the vocational activities of all physical laborers are often not a process for laborers to acquire knowledge. Because the meticulous division of labor divides production departments extremely finely, the scope of experience that a worker can gain is only one thousandth or one ten-thousandth of the knowledge of the entire production process. Moreover, that kind of production method that focuses exclusively on skilled production techniques cannot allow producers to change work departments and occupations, so that they can gain more experience and learning. Therefore, all production laborers cannot go beyond the simple, partial technical work that they are accustomed to in order to experience all knowledge. Therefore, the labor process is difficult to become a process of studying knowledge, difficult to become a process of researching learning. On the other hand, those who engage in the exploration of scientific knowledge not only do not engage much in the practical labor of production, but some even regard knowledge as their own monopoly.</p>
<p>Knowledge is labor, labor is knowledge. All mental laborers must simultaneously become physical laborers, and all physical laborers must simultaneously become mental laborers. How to unify knowledge and labor, how to unify mental laborers and physical laborers, is an important issue related to the development of production. Because if the vocational activities of all people are a process of research in learning and art, a process of knowledge exploration, then people will not feel their occupations are tasteless and dry. Moreover, in the production of knowledge, because it is closely connected to the labor process of practice, it will no longer cause those who seek knowledge to waste their energy and produce empty and illusory spiritual products. Therefore, we can say that the greater production of human knowledge will occur simultaneously with the greater production of human labor. The unification of labor and knowledge is a condition for the simultaneous and unprecedented progress of the spiritual and material production of society.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Great Shanghai</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Mint</h3>
<p>—Ding Zhidao</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on October 27th, our 35 teachers and students, filled with anticipation, enthusiastically boarded a "yellow beetle" of the Taiping Company. We heard a "beep" and the inanimate animal immediately rotated its four wheels, rushing towards our destination with lightning speed.</p>
<p>The Central Mint is located near Gordon Road, on the north bank of Suzhou Creek, not far from where we were, so we arrived at our destination in no time. After getting off the bus at the foot of the wooden bridge in front of the factory, the magnificent factory building was already in front of our eyes.</p>
<p>Two armed police officers stood very solemnly at the gate. To the left of the gate was the reception room, to the right was the guard room, and in the center was a very wide cement road. The roadside was planted with low-growing holly and small trees, all of which were very green and lovely. After passing through the gate, you could see a large fountain. The road divided into three here, with two roads winding around to the back of the building and one road leading directly to the main entrance. From the outside, no one would believe that the Romanesque building, constructed entirely of cement and steel, was a large-scale mint. Especially the several layers of stone steps and the six tall, fluted columns certainly gave us a sense of the extraordinary.</p>
<p>For the convenience of the tour, we divided the entire group into three teams, and our third team took a short rest in the reception room first. Our attending teacher talked to us about the Hubei Arsenal and mentioned the importance of heavy industry in China today.</p>
<p>Soon, a Mr. Chen from the factory was sent to lead us to visit the various departments. He was a very amiable middle-aged man. His appearance was so kind that we dared to ask him all kinds of naive questions. He very carefully told us the trivial details of minting, allowing us to not only understand the steps of minting, but also gain some useful knowledge. We are very grateful.</p>
<p>The first place we arrived at was the raw material room. Besides seeing many large silver bars with a light gray color and busy workers, there was nothing else to describe. But the smelting furnace room inside was the main smelting base and also the first necessary place for manufacturing foreign money and factory silver bars. The silver smelted here is mostly large silver bars shipped from the United States. Each bar is worth 1,000 taels of silver and contains 999/1000 pure silver. After the silver bar is melted into a solution, it is poured into a mold to make a sheet, and then quickly cooled in cold water. When it is taken out of the water again, it has become many regular, narrow silver bars, about half an inch thick, two inches wide, and more than two feet long. In addition to casting these narrow silver bars, the factory also casts factory silver bars (named because they are only manufactured by this factory). Each bar is worth 1,000 yuan and is used exclusively by banks as reserve funds. Its shape is very similar to Guanzi cloth (the name of an ancient coin), a rectangular silver ingot with a handle.</p>
<p>The rolling mill has two machines that specialize in the work of rolling thin and forming blanks. The small silver bars cast in the smelting furnace are transported here by four-wheeled carts. After being pressed and rolled by three or four machines, it becomes a long silver bar of equal thickness to foreign silver bars, and then sent to the blank forming machine. The blank forming machine has a strange flat mouth. As long as the machine is moved, the flat mouth will simply and infinitely swallow the silver bars that are sent over. At the same time, the formed silver blanks – the prototype of foreign silver – will fall into the basket placed under the machine. After the silver blanks are formed, they can be sent to the baking and washing section to receive the baptism of refining and coloring. First, the silver blanks are placed in a round copper barrel with two mouths, similar to a loudspeaker, containing acid liquid. As the barrel rotates non-stop, a red liquid will gradually drip down. After a certain limit, it can be taken out and then flows into a green sulfuric acid pool after the action of another machine. According to Mr. Chen, the factory instructor, this uses chemical action to wash away the silver oxide on the silver blank. After these two steps are done, not only is the tone rhythmic, but the color is also much better.</p>
<p>After the work of refining and coloring, it enters the last stage of minting – edging and embossing. The edging machine is very small, but very delicate and exquisite. As for the embossing machine, just one of its wheels is already much larger than our dining table. Many silver blanks after edging are poured into the round hole behind it, and amid the non-stop "rolling" sound, the imprinted new coins of the Republic of China slide down the channels beside it. The speed averages more than 70 yuan per minute. There are a total of nine of these machines, so their daily output is about 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The minting process can be said to be completed here, but there is also concern that the weight of the silver dollars may not be uniform, so a calibration process must be added. The calibrator is a small rectangular machine, each equipped with seven or eight balances, covered with a large glass cover to prevent dust from entering. Next to each balance is a half-foot long copper tube. After the silver dollars are poured into the tube, they sequentially move and fall onto the balance. If it is lighter than the standard weight, it falls into the lower [wheel tube] next to it and flows from the tank to a barrel near the body. If it exceeds the standard weight, it is sent to the outside bucket through a higher pipe. After the light and heavy silver coins are separated, they are weighed again using the same method. The heavier of the light coins and the lighter of the heavy coins are then considered usable coins.</p>
<p>After the silver coins are calibrated, they are sent to the counting department for packaging and then sent to the silver vault for storage. Here, the steps of minting are truly completed.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>After saying goodbye to Mr. Chen, the special commissioner of the factory, we got on the bus and returned. At this time, everyone's faces were beaming with satisfied smiles.</p>

<h3>Huangmei Tune</h3>
<p>—Shaokang</p>
<p>Huangmei is a large county bordering eastern Hubei and western Anhui. The "Huangmei Tune" originated in this county. This type of opera is usually regarded as a "small opera," to distinguish it from another type of "large opera"—Beijing opera—that is popular in towns and villages.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, since the "Huangmei Tune" is regarded as a "small opera," a "tune," it is not difficult for us to infer the simplicity and crudeness of its content and performance form. Now I would like to briefly talk about this type of opera from the perspective of its content and performance form.</p>
<p>Originally, what the public wanted to see was a "plot" with a rich interest. What they loved was a story with ups and downs, twists and turns, and a beginning and an end. The reason why the "Huangmei Tune" can win the enthusiastic appreciation of the broad masses in Hubei and Anhui is because the structure of this type of opera can meet this condition. Although it does not need to be like the Shanghai school of Beijing opera, such as The Peng Gong Case, The Civet Cat for Crown Prince, or Investiture of the Gods</p>

<h3>Playing Bamboo Mats</h3>
<p>— Zhao Fu</p>
<p>Anqing Qianshan County Communication</p>
<p>A "dianzi" is a bamboo mat, which is a must-have for us during the hot summer months. There are many types of mats, but one made of bamboo is a specialty of our Wangjia River. Wangjia River is a small town in Qianshan County, Anqing. The town has few streets, not much business, and a small population, so naturally, it is not considered prosperous. However, our small place is much more substantial than the nearby towns, such as Sanqiao, Huangnigang, and Jiangzhen. The reason is that our area produces green bamboo mats.</p>
<p>If I told you about the wide distribution of bamboo mats produced here, you might not believe it. Or you might think of our little place as a strange place. Without exaggeration, the bamboo mats from our area are now popular in cities throughout the country. Almost every province in the Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, and Southeast sells bamboo mats from Wangjia River. Even as far as Singapore, Siam, Java, and Sumatra in Southeast Asia, there is no shortage of bamboo mat merchants selling our Wangjia River mats.</p>
<p>The season for using bamboo mats has long passed. However, the season for making bamboo mats is just beginning. The mat makers are all farmers. Making bamboo mats can be considered a side job for them. By the ninth month of the lunar calendar, the early rice harvest has long been stored in the granary (but this year's harvest is not very good due to drought), and the late rice has also been brought ashore (i.e., to the fields). They have a chance to rest a bit. However, they are used to working and cannot stand being idle. Making bamboo mats is an important task for them during this slack farming season. Now is when this work begins.</p>
<p>They have to start cutting the large and small bamboo poles, bought on credit or borrowed from bamboo merchants, one by one. Splitting them open, and smoothing them out; sawing them into strips, splitting them into layers, and smoothing them into pieces. In our area, almost every household in a village makes bamboo mats. The children have seen the process since they were young, so although they have never apprenticed to a master, they are all skilled at making bamboo mats. They will not waste any bamboo scraps. They are skilled in knowing the intricacies of bamboo shavings, and they are also fully aware of everything. Ordinary bamboo mats are made of coarse material, without intricate patterns or coloring. The technique naturally has no difficulty; however, there is also a very refined bamboo mat, the material must be fine, woven with patterns like designs, some of which have dyed bamboo strips interspersed to enhance the beauty of the design, making these kinds of mats naturally requires more effort. Ordinary farming families make mats that sell for lower or moderately high prices, with techniques that are not complicated or slightly complicated.</p>
<p>Can these finished mats find buyers in this cold winter? The weather for using bamboo mats is the hot weather of June, July, and August. Bamboo mat merchants will not come to buy goods until February or March of the lunar calendar. From this point of view, it seems impossible for farmers to rely on one or two bamboo mats to buy rice, oil, salt, firewood. Actually, that's not the case. The bamboo mat business is a big venture, and our small place has many bamboo mat stores with capital. These stores buy bamboo mats all year round. During this season when bamboo mats are not needed, they can lower the prices to buy them, and then sell them at higher prices next spring. When farmers need money, they can carry a bamboo mat to the store. They are all regular customers, so there is no need to argue much about the price. They can immediately get cash and go home. Not only that, but bamboo mat stores are even willing to lend money. That is, if farmers do not have money on hand, nor do they have bamboo mats ready to exchange for money, they can borrow some money from the bamboo mat store in advance, agree on a date, and bring the finished bamboo mats to repay the debt (the date cannot be too long, at most a month or two). Bamboo mats have a large market and are not afraid of not selling. Bamboo mats bought in this way by lending money are even two jiao cheaper than ordinary bamboo mats, so bamboo mat stores are happy to do this kind of business with farmers.</p>
<p>Farmers usually make bamboo mats from around the tenth month of the lunar calendar in the first year until the fourth month of the following year. After April, the merchants have already transported the bamboo mats away, and they are busy with farming. Naturally, they have to stop this work for a while.</p>
<p>Regarding the transportation and sales of bamboo mats, I would like to say a few more words here. Bamboo mat merchants mostly buy goods from bamboo mat stores. When they come, they usually bring a considerable amount of capital. Large merchants have capital of up to 10,000 yuan or more, while small merchants have at least a thousand or a few hundred. Some of these merchants come from distant cities, but most come from nearby counties and townships. Because everyone believes that this kind of business is profitable, they all flock to it. Indeed, many people have started families because they have earned a lot of money from this business over the years. However, a few people have lost money in this business and cannot repay their debts. The sales of bamboo mats are closely related to the weather and the market situation. If it is hot this year, the bamboo mat business will naturally be good, but it may not be as good as people in this industry hope. The reason is that the market is sluggish.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to mention the price of bamboo mats. Ordinary bamboo mats with poor quality generally cost from six or seven jiao to eight or nine jiao per mat (this is based on the price farmers sell to bamboo mat stores). Bamboo mats that cost one yuan or more and less than two yuan are better. Bamboo mats that cost three or four yuan per mat are very good and can also be folded. The best bamboo mats can be worth more than twenty yuan. This is a type of bamboo mat that is made with high quality material, extremely fine, and meticulously woven.</p>
<p>There are more than a dozen or twenty consecutive episodes of [Continuous Good Plays], but [Huangmei Opera] does indeed adopt this similar format. The performance style of [Huangmei Opera] can usually be divided into three parts: the main play, the "dǎ cǎi" (seeking rewards), and the inserted play. Depending on the length of the script, the main play may consist of only one or two or three acts, or because the script is too long, only half an act can be performed, and the entire play is divided into two performances. Plays with very long scripts, such as [Qiaomai Ji], [Wujin Ji], [Paihuan Ji], [Fenghuang Ji], [Maihua Ji], [Sanbin Ji], [Songci Ji], [Wupen Ji], [Enge Ji], [Gounai Ji], [Zhenzhu Ta], [Baihua Ting], [Shanbo Fangyou], [Zhang Chaozong Gao Jianchen], [Da Hongmei], [Shuanghe Jing], [Yu Wang Hui Mu]... etc., can mostly sustain a main play, among which [Zhang Chaozong Gao Jianchen], [Yu Wang Hui Mu] etc. have front and back parts, which can be divided into two performances. These plays can usually be performed for three or four hours or more. In terms of plot, these plays are mostly bizarre and complex, with a mournful yet enchanting tone, making them extremely suitable for the psychology of the backward masses.</p>
<p>Each play often contains some individual small scenes, which can be arbitrarily expanded, shortened, or omitted during the performance depending on the length of time available. For example, the play [Shanbo Fangyou] contains these small segments: [Visiting a Friend], [Seeing off a Friend], [Gathering Herbs], [Returning to Heaven], [Mourning], [Crying at the Funeral], etc. If there is not enough time to perform the entire play, some scenes can be omitted. If these scenes could be elaborated and depicted in the same way as Shanghai-style Peking Opera, it would be possible to create continuous good plays.</p>
<p>[Inserted Plays] are [small plays] within [small plays], and their content is inseparable from matters of romance. This is exactly what is most criticized by the moralistic gentlemen and gentry about [Huangmei Opera]. There are many [continuous good plays] in this category. The most famous [inserted plays] are those depicting the deeds of [Yu Lao Si] and [Cai Mingfeng]. The following plays are about Yu Lao Si: [Yu Lao Si Bainián], [Yu Lao Si Fanqing], [Yu Lao Si Da Wǎ], [Yu Lao Si Guo Gàilǐng], [Yu Lao Si Chongjun], [Zhang Er Nü Shíèr Xiǎng], etc. The following plays are about Cai Mingfeng: [Xiǎo Cí Diàn], [Páidāo Ji], [Màifàn Nü Xiūshū], etc. These plays can all be performed independently, just like the cases in the Peng Gong An, each case can be performed independently.</p>
<p>Writing to this point, I cannot [help but briefly mention the content of these plays. Chinese society is still a semi-feudal society, and the various customs and practices of the people still cannot escape the remnants of feudalism. As a form of popular entertainment that reflects the level of popular culture and thought, its content is predictably outdated and superficial. Promoting superstition and obscenity can be said to be the common ailment of most popular folk plays. [Huangmei Opera] retains all of these harmful qualities. It reduces the private affairs of young masters and misses and the happy unions of talented scholars and beautiful women to the small scope of personal happiness, and uses superstitious methods of seeing gods and ghosts, reaching the end of the road and then encountering immortals to appeal to the audience's curiosity—all of this is harmful to social progress. We do not blindly attack the explicit depictions of pornography and performances in the [inserted plays] in the same way as the moralistic gentlemen do, but if we examine them one by one, we find that there is too little to appreciate. [Dǎ Cǎi] is even more absurd. I only need to mention one thing for you to understand. The purpose of the dǎ cǎi is to solicit money from the audience, and the audience can use various methods to embarrass the actors on stage who are dressed as women, such as holding money in their mouths and requiring the actor to use their mouth to take it, and so on.</p>
<p>However, whether it is the [main play], the [dǎ cǎi], or the [inserted play], they all have a large audience. This is something we cannot ignore. Folk dramas mostly have simple themes, are performed in local dialects, and are mostly easy to organize. [Huangmei Opera] also has these advantages. Many of the themes of [Huangmei Opera] are [local scenery]. Of course, many [Huangmei Operas] are derived from past novels, legends, Kun Opera, and Peking Opera, such as Zhenzhu Ta, Wupen Ji, Liang Shanbo Zhu Yingtai... etc., are not unique to Huangmei Opera. Kun Opera, Shaoxing Opera, and Siming Opera all have these segments. But [Huangmei Opera] does indeed have its own unique aspects. Many plays in [Huangmei Opera] are accurate dramatizations of real events. These events mostly occurred in Huangmei and other parts of Anhui, as well as in Henan or Jiangxi. For example, the [Songci Ji] and [Wujin Ji] in the main play and the stories about Yu Lao Si and Cai Mingfeng in the inserted plays are said to be true events with real people and real places. For example, the story in [Songci Ji] takes place in Taihu, and the lawsuit was later taken to Anqing, Nanjing, and Beijing. The two robbers in [Wujin Ji] are said to have been caught in Ruichang County, Jiangxi. [Yu Lao Si Guo Gàilǐng] The so-called Gaileng is a mountain on the border of Susong and Huangmei, it is a road that Yu Lao Si must pass through when he goes home from Taihu. It is said that Yu Lao Si had an affair with Zhang Er Mei in Taihu. Even today, the people of Taihu still do not recognize the principal's reputation, and some places in Taihu still ban performances of this kind of play about Yu Lao Si. From this it can be seen that [Huangmei Opera] has a strong local flavor.</p>
<p>[Huangmei Opera] scripts often use rural slang, simplified characters, vulgar characters, and misspelled characters, filling the lines. In the early years, what was popular was a hand-copied version of the songbook. Now, because it is quite popular, wooden block printed versions have appeared in major and minor cities in Anhui and Hubei (centered on Huangmei, east to Datong, west to Hankou, south to Wuxue, and north to Huangma and above. There are immigrants from Anhui in the Yuqian area of Zhejiang during the Hongyang era, and they brought [Huangmei Opera] there). The [spontaneous spread] of [Huangmei Opera] is closely related to the dissemination of these songbooks and its performance style.</p>
<p>[Huangmei Opera] is gradually becoming urbanized. Some theaters in large cities in Anhui and Hubei are [deserted] when performing Peking Opera, but when they switch to performing [Huangmei Opera], they inevitably [become a sensation]. There have been Peking Opera troupes that switched to singing [Huangmei Opera] and achieved commercial success. There are female roles in Peking Opera troupes, and when female roles sing erotic [Huangmei Opera], it goes without saying that it is even more sensational far and wide.</p>
<p>[Huangmei Opera] undoubtedly has many shortcomings, but it is able to adopt popular themes for popular performances, and thus gain a very broad audience. This is something that those of us who are concerned about drama cannot help but pay attention to.</p>
<p>Illustrated Introduction</p>
<h3>Reading the Inaugural Issue of [Reading Life]</h3>
<p>— Yu Cheng</p>
<p>—Published by Shanghai Modern Magazine Company, Priced at Two Jiao—</p>
<p>It is said that more than six hundred magazines have been published within this year, which can be considered a rare boom in the traditionally weak and indifferent Chinese cultural scene. However, how many of these five or six hundred magazines are urgently needed by the general public? Frankly speaking, we really can't find many magazines to recommend to the general public.</p>
<p>[Reading Life] was only recently published, and after reading it, I feel that it is a magazine worth introducing. In it, we can see scientific reading methods and writing rules, general knowledge about scientific philosophy and literature, and also see the lifestyles and academic abilities of ordinary shop assistants and apprentices. Although there are some shortcomings in the content and writing techniques of the various works, we still think it is fortunate that there is such a magazine that guides reading and is suitable for the general public.</p>
<p>[Reading Life] first tells us in its [Inaugural Message]:</p>
<p>[Reading Life] advocates that reading is reading live books, struggling to make a living while taking advantage of every minute in the midst of extreme chaos to read; it is to integrate reading into life. In order for us to have a better life, to make our lives better. Our lives should be guided by knowledge, otherwise it will be like a blind man riding a blind horse. One aspect of this life knowledge is to accept the life experiences left by our predecessors, and the other is to develop it in real life. We cannot be biased towards one aspect. Therefore, we advocate reading, but we must read books that our lives need; we advocate reading, but it must be reading that is coordinated with our life practice; we advocate reading, but it must be reading with correct methodological guidance; at the same time, we oppose reading books that do not meet our life needs, reading that is separated from life, and reading without methods. ]</p>
<p>Reading is useful, reading cannot be discussed separately from life, and therefore there are correct methods for it. Theories such as [reading for the sake of reading] and [reading for relaxation] cannot justify themselves. [Reading Life] knows this problem, so it first raised it and gave a correct answer to the general readers.</p>
<p>Under this principle, [Reading Life] more specifically tells us many research methods. For example, Mr. Bo Han's [Rationalizing the Demands of Reading Life], Mr. Li Gongpu's [Three Paths to Seeking Knowledge], and several articles in the [Reading Q&amp;A] column, all discuss reading problems very practically, and are of great benefit to ordinary shop assistants and apprentices who are just starting to read. At the same time, Mr. Li Fu's [Can Literature Be Used as Food?], Mr. Wen Siqi's [Philosophy Is Not Mysterious], and Mr. Xingfu Li Chongji's [Talking About Death Rays] also treat these academic subjects as products of human material life, and discuss them from a social perspective, which is completely different from the arguments of those metaphysicians.</p>
<p>However, what I pay special attention to are several works in the [Life Record] and [Youth Creation Guidance] columns.</p>
<p>In the [Life Record] column, there are three works: the first is Mr. Zhuang Xiaojing's [The Day of Collecting Copper Plates], the second is Mr. Huang Shuhui's [Keeping the Collection in a Lotus Leaf Bag], and the third is Mr. Fang Yuanqi's [Under the Small Kerosene Lamp]. The first describes the factory life of a female worker, and the two others record the reading life of shop assistants and apprentices. Although these three pieces are not written as beautifully as our writers, I believe that what they describe is very real, and not what we can imagine. Therefore, I hope that those writers who are always hidden in attics and never understand the lives of ordinary people will pay attention to these three pieces, especially the first one, which is a very practical literary theme that is much better than the themes you think of in your head or find in newspapers.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the several creations in the [Youth Creation Guidance] column are all very immature. But I don't want to criticize them here. What I want to say is the method of guiding youth creation by the gentlemen of [Reading Life]. They first publish a young person's work, and then specifically point out its shortcomings behind it. I think this method is much better than the method of having ordinary young people read books like [Novel Writing]. Although there are still some shortcomings in their guidance work this time, we believe that as long as they continue to do this for a long time, there will definitely be great gains.</p>
<p>I like [Reading Life], I approve of [Reading Life]'s method of guiding ordinary readers to learn. Precisely because of this, I not only introduce it to ordinary readers, but also have to hope that it will be more perfect. To this end, I would like to offer a few suggestions to the gentlemen of [Reading Life]:</p>
<p>1. They should try their best to specifically tell ordinary readers some correct learning methods, and should not only talk about all the phenomena in the Chinese cultural world without putting forward specific methods. Because what ordinary readers urgently need at present is how to learn and how to solve problems, not just to understand the phenomena and raise questions. However, some of the texts in this issue of [Reading Life] mainly explain the phenomena without putting forward specific methods. For example, Mr. Zheng Nong's [What to Give the Public to Read] has such defects.</p>
<p>2. Those articles that are not urgently needed by ordinary people and cannot arouse readers' interest should preferably not be published. I don't think it is necessary to publish the first article by Mr. Chen Wangdao, even though Mr. Chen is a celebrity.</p>
<p>3. I hope that some systematic academic papers will be published in the future so that after reading an academic paper, we can have a basic concept of that academic field.</p>
<p>4. In reality, the books that ordinary people often read are mostly old chapter novels. For example, when Yuan Fangqi describes his reading life, he says that he likes to read novels such as [Jingu Qiguan] and [Bao Gong An]. However, these things are harmful and useless readings. In the future, in addition to telling ordinary readers what books they should read, the gentlemen of [Reading Life] should strictly criticize ordinary old but undesirable readings that are liked by some people, so as to prevent readers from being poisoned by them.</p>
<p>5. It is naturally good to guide ordinary young people to write like the [Youth Creation Guidance] column, but it is biased towards creating novels and has not fulfilled its responsibility in guiding ordinary young people to learn how to write academic research articles. In fact, I believe that there must be many people among ordinary young people who need this guidance, so I hope that [Reading Life] can find ways to satisfy their hope in the future.</p>
<p>6. There should be more book and newspaper reviews so that readers can choose to read.</p>
<p>Jesting About Matters After Death The Recent Situation of Vietnamese and Taiwanese Culture</p>
<p>— By Jiang Kanghu</p>
<p>[Jesting about matters after death, yet today I come to the fore.] If our people want to know in advance what the state of our inherent culture will be after the demise of the country, please travel north to Dalian, south to Hong Kong and Macao, and especially to French Indochina and Japanese Taiwan. Annan has been a Chinese prefecture since the Han Dynasty, and later became a tributary state. In addition to paying tribute annually, it was allowed to establish its own government. However, most of its people are of Chinese descent, and its culture was entirely exported by China. Fifty years ago, it was ceded to the French. Since then, it has been fundamentally controlled by imperialism. It started with culture: French language schools were established everywhere, a Romanized alphabet was created, and the use of Chinese characters was prohibited in public and private institutions. As of today, except for a very small number of officials and literati, most people not only cannot read Chinese books, but even their own names, which were originally Chinese characters, cannot be recognized or written, but can only be spelled out in Roman letters. Through decades of political power, more than two thousand years of cultural heritage have been eliminated. All historical relics scattered among the people have been collected and placed in the Far East Museum run by the government, which is attached to a Far East College, gathering dozens of French archaeologists and Annanese scholars to study and preserve them as a special academic discipline for a special class, and its impact on society and life has been swept away! The schools established by overseas Chinese are also subject to strict suppression: 1. The textbooks and grades must be submitted for inspection, 2. Government officials are free to send people to supervise classes, and 3. Annanese students are absolutely not allowed to be enrolled. As for Taiwan, it has been part of Chinese territory for more than 300 years since the reign of King Zheng Yanping! Its people, culture, language, and customs are no different from those of the mainland. Forty years ago, it was ceded to the Japanese, and all residents were registered as Japanese nationals. A narcotizing and enslaving education was implemented, forcing the Japanese language as the national language, prohibiting the use of the local language (i.e., Xiamen language) in public places, and the textbooks in public schools were specially compiled by the Governor-General, and all Chinese characters were read in Japanese pronunciation according to kana. To this day, people under the age of 30, with special exceptions (such as those who specialize in literature, those who have received home education, and those who have studied in China), cannot write Chinese, nor can they directly read Chinese characters in Chinese pronunciation. Except for Chinese language classes in official schools, no institution for learning or studying Chinese is allowed. Because of this regulation, overseas Chinese schools are not allowed to be established, and the children of Chinese expatriates are not allowed to learn their native language. This is truly a strange phenomenon unprecedented in the five continents and all nations. The Chinese Association organized by overseas Chinese and the Chinese Consul-General stationed in Taiwan have repeatedly petitioned and negotiated with the Japanese authorities, but to no avail. They only said: [This is the Empire's policy for governing Taiwan, and it will never be changed or compromised, nor will it be explained, only obedience is required.] On the one hand, extremely severe measures are used to prohibit any cultural undertakings similar to schools, arresting their initiators and supporters, and confiscating their property. Thus, Chinese culture cannot exist in Taiwan unless it is assimilated by Japanese culture. From this, we can see that those who are arrogantly self-important and think that Chinese culture can never be obliterated are actually daydreaming and deceiving themselves; and we can also see that those who are arrogantly self-deprecating and despise China's inherent culture are actually wielding a knife on behalf of others and committing suicide.</p>

<h3>Rural Sidelines in China</h3>
<p>— Mo Qiu</p>
<p>The so-called sideline is, of course, a relative term to the main occupation. The main occupation of a farming family is undoubtedly farming. Outside of farming as the main occupation, using leftover materials or vacant land, utilizing spare time and remaining energy to engage in production to supplement their livelihood, that is their sideline, which is what we call rural sidelines.</p>
<p>In the past, China's rural sidelines mainly consisted of rural household handicrafts, such as spinning cotton, weaving cloth, raising silkworms, and reeling silk. Secondly, it was raising domestic fowl and livestock, and beekeeping for honey. However, since the economic forces of imperialism invaded, the rural economy of our country has gradually changed. Consequently, the inherent rural household handicrafts have lost their main position in China's rural sidelines, replaced by businesses such as planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms, and planting tea and making tea.</p>
<p>When the economic forces of imperialism had not long invaded China, because foreign entrepreneurs were keen to purchase materials from rural China, ordinary farming families felt that planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms was more profitable than planting wheat and rice. So, they even used rice paddies and wheat fields to plant mulberry trees. At the same time, due to the development of transportation and the increase in foreign trade, the sales of Chinese tea also increased. Thus, in tea-producing regions, some farming families also used mountainous land occupied by many trees, and even land originally used to grow food crops, to plant tea. In this way, silk and tea, as the main rural sidelines, occupied a more important position in our rural economy.</p>
<p>However, under the control of the magic power of imperialism, our country's industries could not develop freely, and therefore various industries could not compete successfully. In recent years, due to the competition of foreign goods and the impact of the global recession, silk and tea leaves, which are the main rural sidelines in our country, have also experienced a decline.</p>
<p>Let's look at the silk industry first. Under the influence of the competition of artificial silk and the exclusion of Japanese silk, raw silk, which originally held the first position in our country's foreign trade, has shown a state of decreasing exports in recent years: This is very clearly demonstrated in the table below -</p>
<p>Export Volume (unit: dan)　Export Price (unit: customs tael)</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 15　168,563　144,826,358</p>
<p>Year 16　160,002　128,705,732</p>
<p>Year 17　180,186　145,443,481</p>
<p>Year 18　189,980　147,681,238</p>
<p>Year 19　151,429　249,481,124</p>
<p>Year 20　136,189　84,680,482</p>
<p>Year 21　78,219　32,932,250</p>
<p>By the following year, the export of raw silk from our country decreased even more, and its market price almost fell to around 500 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>Because of the sharp decrease in silk prices and the continuous decrease in the export of raw silk, the businesses of planting mulberry trees, raising silkworms, and reeling silk among farming families will naturally be harmed. According to investigations, in Jiangsu, mulberry fields have decreased by eight or nine mu in recent years. In other provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, farmers have also converted many mulberry fields to opium planting in recent years due to the failure of planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms. - From this, one can see a glimpse of the current situation of the rural silk industry.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the tea industry. The main tea-producing regions in our country are Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Fujian. Secondary ones are Shandong and Henan provinces. Their production is very large and is also one of our country's major exports. However, in recent years, due to the failure to improve manufacturing methods and the competition from Japanese and Indian tea, the tea industry in our country has also shown a very declining phenomenon. Most tea producers in various places have lost their costs, and some even cannot maintain their business. According to the profit and loss situation of red and green boxed tea in Anhui and Jiangxi as reported in the [Ta Kung Pao] on July 7 of the year before last:</p>
<p>Category　Cost　Selling Price　Profit/Loss</p>
<p>Black Tea　Qimen (Anhui)　400 taels (very low quality)　200 taels　Loss of 50%　Qiupu (Anhui)　Around 100 taels　Around 100 taels　No Loss　Wuning (Jiangxi)　Over 70 taels　45-80 taels　Loss of over 20 taels　Hukou (Jiangxi)　Over 50 taels　52 taels　No Loss　Fuliang (Jiangxi)　Around 100 taels　Over 70 taels　Loss of over 20 taels</p>
<p>Green Tea　Suyuan (Anhui)　50-100 yuan　Around 100 yuan　Slight Profit　She County (Anhui)　Current route 95 taels, Western route 68-76 yuan　--Loss　Tunxi (Anhui)　Over 140 yuan　165 yuan　Loss of 70-80 taels　Yutian (Jiangxi)　Needle Eyebrow 60 taels　32-36 taels　Loss of over 20 taels</p>
<p>Shrimp Eye　52 taels　8 taels</p>
<p>Because of the continuous decrease in tea prices and the losses of tea producers, the area of tea gardens will naturally decrease, affecting tea production. According to investigations, before Republic of China Year 18, the area of domestic tea gardens was 5,353,355 mu, and the output was 5,915,574 dan. What about recently? The area of tea gardens has decreased to 4,475,928 mu, and the output has also decreased to 4,499,455 dan, a decrease of almost one-fifth compared to before Republic of China Year 18. - From this, one can generally see the decline of the tea industry in our country.</p>
<p>The situation of other rural sidelines, such as beekeeping, animal husbandry, and household handicrafts, is similar to that of the silk and tea industries, so there is no need to discuss them in detail here.</p>

<p>Five New Life Reform Customs Methods</p>
<p>[Marriage]. Indicates the union of both men and women, informing relatives and friends, the former imperial era, the ceremonial guards indicated official rank, now it has been abolished and can be reduced, such as palace lanterns to guide, or still take meaning. Happy wine is not necessary, congratulatory guests come to observe the ceremony, why only food and drink, prepare tea can be, noisy wedding chamber should be canceled. [Mourning]. The main thing is sorrow, no more heart in food, why cry at the coffin, eat their wine and food. Ceremonial guards are simplified. Longevity. Begins at the age of fifty or more. Birthday feasts should be abolished, the death of a wife is called the end of life, how can one say longevity. It is appropriate to severely eradicate the evil practice of sensationalism. [Banquet]. Started with sacrifices to share the spoils, not daring to enjoy alone, so it must be shared with relatives and friends, so that the disciples can understand the order of seniority, such as the Qingming spring wine, New Year's wine and other banquets with relatives and friends, which is still preserving the ancient meaning, if extravagance, the time is aimless, should be restricted. [Gift Giving]. It is appropriate to focus on affection rather than things. Tianxu I Sheng advocates sending candles as a gift, which is more meaningful, if based on money, now even if it can not be compared with the past, the most should be four yuan, so the recipient is not hurt by honesty, and the giver is not hurt by Hui is the limit.</p>
