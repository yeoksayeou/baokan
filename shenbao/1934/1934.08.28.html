<p>時評水旱災後之農業救濟　  敬　　我國農村經濟的濒於破產。已不可掩飾。集中全力来救濟。也是有識者所共認。我國農村經濟恐慌之所以日趨深刻。因受着世界恐慌的激盪。加以今年入春以来。長江下游各省很普遍的遭逢旱災。卽有相當灌漑設備的地方。其收成預計至多也不過十分之五六。其餘颗粒無收的地方。如兩湖江浙等省實在不少。而黄河流域一帶。又洪水成災。收穫亦很微薄。總之南方的災象。已甚嚴重。安徽秋浦的難民且有吃大戶之舉。浙江的農民因衣食無着而自殺的很多。這種现象。實在是國家民族整個的危機。　　現在「老弱轉乎溝壑。少壯散之四方。」已是到處皆然成爲司空見慣的現象。這些散之四方的窮民大槪祇有兩條出路。一是投到軍隊去當兵。二則流入都市去作工。當兵雖不能絕對說壞。但在全國苦於冗兵過剩的時候。究竟不是正途。都市方面的工廠和其他事業。近來非特不能吸收離村的農民。并且還要剔除出去。所以農民到都市裏找工作。是非常的困難。除此以外。就要流爲乞丐盜賊了。其中的危險眞是非同小可。　　近來政府當局。已注意及此。對災區擬减免捐税藉輕農民負担。金融界則已實行向農村放欵。以求舒展農村經濟。同時使聚積在都市裏的過量现金。重新流回農村去。這在平時如果沒有災荒。沒有戰事。沒有從國際方面襲來的經濟侵略。自然是很有效的。然而如今天災流行。人禍未息。加以外商倾銷獨占。與遠東戰機日迫。農村經濟。感受着莫大威脅。非上述方法所能有濟的。　　講到積極救濟農民的方法。當然非這篇短文所能盡述。祇得略提一項原則出來。以供國人考慮。希望我們能設法在工業方面。爲農民謀一出路。目下以私人資本經營私人事業。徵取利潤已等於針上削鐵。惟有以國家資本來經營正在試騐中的新方法。或易見效。因爲公營事業。不是純粹以營利爲目的。而是以公共福利爲前提。這在先進諸國早巳施行而有效的。我國今日的工業雖落人後。但能以集團的力量。共同努力。則不難爲農民造福。倘由公家（無論是中央是地方）出資興辦事業。而委有經營智識和工作經騐的人去辦。假以相當時日。充分利用科學方法。和失業農民的勞力。可决其必然有效的。現姑列舉幾種應辦的事業如下。　　（一）恢復停業各廠。就已停工各廠而論。經營不得法者半。因市面不佳而停者亦半。若由政府借給廠主以資本。并指示其經營途徑。而不專注力於營利。則事業前途。必有希望。否則由政府委人直接經營。對前廠主算作股東。准其參加工作。并採納其以往經騐。則已停工之工廠。不難恢復。農民出路也可同時開拓。　　（二）重工業和化學工業。在我國很是幼穉。要大規模的舉辦。那就非用集團力不可。技術方面的困難。可以讓科學的方法去謀解决。　　（三）發展交通工業。我國交通工業多是國營的。但向來辦事人員的官僚習氣太重。責任心太輕。今後應該革除舊習盡量爲農民的便利服務。　　上述三類事業。如能立卽着手。則一方面可以救濟大批農民。他方面可爲生產事業奠定基礎。爲國家百年大計開一條道路。郵儲滙業局　　　　籌辦農民貸欵　　　　江浙兩省先行試辦　　（南京）　交通部郵儲匯業局儲金數量、逐年增加、該局長唐寶書認此項儲金專事匯押生息、未免利用之範圍過於狹窄、不如投資實業、設立國内農民貸欵機關、藉以調劑農村經濟、交部當局准撥儲金五百萬元、爲農民貸欵基金、如将來全國各城市鄕鎭郵匯、完全開辦後、隨時增加、惟辦法頗爲繁雜、如農民生活狀况工商業情形、與農民關係農民銀行之貸欵利息及手續、平均田畝數量、及貧苦農民家庭負担等等、均須先行調查、前郵區副局長程士範、曾赴隴海·膠濟·平漢·津浦·京滬、滬杭甬各路沿綫、實地調查内地曁各城市鎭等郵區就地由郵局辦理、現分別調查完畢、呈報交部、研究之下、决以江浙兩省區先行試辦貸欵基金、江蘇約八十萬、浙江五十萬、貸欵處郵局之所在地、普遍設立、分爲兩部、（一）貸欵、（二）農產滙押轉運、使農民低利之欵可貸、且使農產物流通各地、各區貸欵機關工作人員、就郵局職員中訓練、按區域大小、隨時調派、如事實上需要時、與兩省農民銀行合作、（二十七日專電）南路軍電告克白毛山　　（南昌）　粤電告、五日午我軍攻俗獅子寨、殘匪退會昌、又龍崗之白毛山、爲口師克復、（二十七日專電）</p>

<p>自由談聰明與矛盾  微明　　人，是極聰明的動物：但因爲極聰明，有時也就成爲極矛盾的動物。獅子，老虎，乃至螞蟻，爲了要生活的緣故，常常反而喪失了生命。這在聰明的人類看來，眞是矛盾事情一件。然而獅子老虎牠們本身的行爲和意志却是一貫的，一點矛盾也沒有。　　自有人類以來，最初那幾萬年（或者幾百萬年）大槪還很富有「獸性」，只看各民族的神話裏都有些「硬幹到底」的故事，就可以知道。人類之所以能在原始時代生活下來並且進化爲「文明人」，未始不是全靠有這「獸性」。但旣已文明了後，有些最「澈悟」的聰明人就顯示出他之所以「異於禽獸」來了。他們遇到困難的環境會「趨避」；不但會「趨避」，還會造出「你不趨避，也算不了什麼」的哲學。更進一步，他們還有「趨避卽是消極的奮鬥」的哲學。到這一步，論證圓滿，於是乎亂世年頭「隱士」也是寶貝了。　　亂世也罷，治世也罷，做「隱士」本來人各有其「自由」。然而偏偏要從隱士生涯上闡明一番大道理以證明並非「逃」，不但未「逃」，且若諷示於衆曰：「不要忘記了還有我在！世論之推移，或亦與有力焉！」善哉善哉！本來人各有其「自由」以爲「我」乃以「隱」戰者。然而持論至此，未免矛盾了！要是人類祖先都如此，則「神皇」的寶座至今尙必存在！　　　古代人尙坦白自認了個「苟全亂世，不問理亂」；是在這一點上，古人不及今人「聰明」，但也是在這一點上，古人比今人少點矛盾。電影字幕與廣告  稜磨　　美國出版的前衛叢書中的一本藝術論內，在講電影的時候，說電影字幕與廣告，是最壞的文字教育，因爲他們只圖迎一般人的趣味，激動他們的感情，引起他們的輕信，但他們都是最有勢力的文字，因爲儘有人違一本通俗小說也不看，却不免時時去看一點電影，翻幾條廣告。這情形確是很普遍的。　　我們倘一留意我們所見到的電影字幕（有聲電影中的對話，也可以一例看待。）和廣告，則對於文言，白話，大衆語之爭，一定會感到廢然。無文論言，白話，都曾以最壞的標本出現上述兩種文字中過，大衆語現在在提倡中，將以怎樣的姿態出現於字幕與廣告中，我們不能知道，但希望其能迎下，總似乎過奢，至多他們不再製造最壞的標本罷了。　　通行的程式文字，是提倡白話者所莫奈何的，將來大衆語，仍是對之無可奈何，字幕與廣告方面的情形，並不比程式文字更有辦法，一種制度的堅持，實沒有一種心理的堅持的固執。語言運動，尤其現在的大衆語運動，是要領導人使用進步的語言的，而電影字幕與廣告，爲求其流行，通常必採用現行語言水準以下的語言。一方面要曳向前，一方面却拉向後。　　如此，字幕與廣告，不但顯然不能迎下，並且連趕上也成問題。就這一面看，大衆語的提倡，不免是跳躍的幻想。我們固然不能否認，在白話文成立之後，字幕與廣告，還算是最力的趕向前者，然而他們却抄了近路，章回體與新文體的混合，是在兩者上顯示得最淸楚。現在要他再趕一程，他們的已滯重的身體，怕已失去了力量。　　大槪不幸是由於寫文章的都是「文人」，每每把文學提出作文字的前趨。但前趨不顧及後隨者，於是愈趨愈遠，這可說是白話文終於被非難的原來。現在爲大衆語作打算的，又在理想迎下，趕上，縱通，橫通，把大衆語點綴得十全十美。也許，的確能產生被認爲十全十美的文學的，但字幕與廣告的作者或願意不列於文學之內，而自繼續其最壞的文字教育。高爾基論文學用語  企揚　　　最近蘇俄文壇上發生了一個大事件，就是高爾基和綏拉菲莫維奇關於潘菲洛夫的「布魯斯基」的論戰。這論戰是以文藝作品中的言語問題爲中心。高爾基反對綏拉菲莫維奇無條件地稱讚潘菲洛夫，那主要的理由就是因爲「布魯斯基」中的言語非常粗雜。由此可知高爾基對於文學　用語的問題是給予了極大的注意的。在最近一篇「與靑年作家的談話」中，高爾基更明白地指示了文學用語的重要。他說：　　「文學的第一個要素是言語，牠是文學的基本要具，並且－和各種事實，各種生活現象一道－是文學的材料。…言語是一切事實，一切思想的外衣。但在事實的背後隱藏着那社會的意義，在各各思想的背後隱藏着原因。」　　這裏指出了言語在文學領域內的重要，而且說明了言語是反映人類的社會關係的。所以：　　「藝術的作品，旣是以在那一切的重要性和完璧和明晰中去描出隱在各種事實裏面的社會生活的意義爲目的，就必須有正確的言語，仔細挑選出來的言語。「古典作家們」就正是用這樣的言語，經過了幾世紀，一面漸次地將牠完成，一面寫作的。這就是眞正的文學語。自然牠是從勤勞大衆的口語汲取來的。牠之所以逈異於自己的起源者，就是因爲在描寫的時候牠從口語的自然性之中把一切偶然的，一時的和不確實的，輕浮的，不合於音聲學的，由於種種原因以致與基本的「精神」（一般語族言語的構造）不一致的，通通拋棄。口頭的言語殘留在文學者所描寫的人物的口語中，是不待說的。然而亦也不過是爲了要給被描寫的人物以更造型的，浮彫的特徵，以更大的潑刺，而極少量地殘留着。」　　這是對於大衆的口語與文學用語之音質關聯和差別的極正確的理解。高爾基並沒有把文學語從大衆語分離，或是與之對立。他明白地指出了文學語是從大衆的口語汲取來的。言語旣由民衆所創造，則藝術的言語、用高爾基的話來說，就不外是這民衆的言語（毛胚的言語）由藝術家加了一番工而已（見「看我的文學修養」）。所以問題並不在文學作品應不應該用大衆語來寫，而在作家怎樣去學取大衆語，然後對牠加以選擇和洗鍊，使牠成爲眞正的藝術的語言。高爾基勸作家多接近民間的傳說，俚諺，歌謠，就是因爲在這些最能表現人民大衆的思想的東西裏面可以找到使藝術豐富的材料。他舉普希金作例子，說這位俄國的偉大詩人就是對「莫斯科的烤聖餅的女人」的言語給了很高的評價，跟自己的奶媽安麗納，洛幾奧羅夫娜去學習過來的。但同時，高爾基並沒有忘記指出：「恭順的奶媽，車夫，漁夫，農村的獵師以及其他艱苦的生活的人們雖一般地對文學語的發達給予一决定的影響，但文學者們却是從活的口頭語的自然力的奔流之中選擇了最正確，最妥當而又最有意義的言語。」　　高爾基一面强調，在文學領域內的言語的選擇的重要，一面又警告我們新的文學的言語必須從活生生的大衆的口頭語中去獲得，决不是在「溫室」裏創造得出來的。他說他少年時候就曾作過這樣幼稚的努力，想由自己創造出新的言語來。「造成這個幼稚的努力的原因的，」他告訴我們說，「就是法律家！律師，檢事的雄辯。我看見「善」與「惡」都穿着同樣美麗的言語的衣裳，人們的告發者和辯護者都以同等的巧妙使用着同一的語彙，而覺得奇怪起來。於是我很滑稽地拚命去創造「自己的言語」，就這樣寫完了好幾本簿子。這也是一種「小兒病」。」少年高爾基的這種「小兒病」對於我們的靑年作家却是有極大的教訓意義的。　　語彙的豐富，文句的流麗和華美都必須從汲取不盡的大衆的言語中去選擇和洗鍊，這樣才能爲大衆所了解，所愛好。和大衆離開，專供少爺小姐們去消遣的一切唯美的煩瑣的文字遊戲是應該排斥的。所以高爾基在和突擊隊員的談話中說：「你們是在爲幾百萬的大衆而寫作，這就使你們負了認眞的工作，對言語的正直的態度，明確，明朗的義務。」他不止一次地强調了言語的單純和明瞭之重要。他在給綏拉菲莫維奇的公開信中就說了應該爲言語的單純和明晰而奮鬥的話。「不要把大地方給言語，把寬座位給思想吧。」這是文學用語的最好的標準。　　高爾基對於文學用語的見解是和他的創作的實踐完全一致的。拉金說；「高爾基，富爾瑪諾夫，綏拉菲莫維奇的作品在大衆之間的「成功的秘訣」，就在於他們用語之極度的單純性，形象之結晶的明確的透明性，故事之特殊的接近大衆的表現，以及排除故意的嚕囌和文句不明的「遊戲」等。」，就是明證。門外文談  華圉　　（四）寫字就是畫畫　　「周禮」和「說文解字」上都說文字的構成法有六種，這里且不談罷，只說些和「象形」有關的東西。　　象形，「近取諸身，遠取諸物」，就是畫一隻眼睛是「目」，畫一個圓圈，放幾條毫光是「日」，那自然很明白，便當的。但有時要碰壁，譬如要畫刀口，怎麼辦呢？不畫刀背，也顯不出刀口來，這時就只好別出心裁，在刀口上加一條短棍，算是指明「這個地方」的意思，造了「刃」。這已經頗有些辦事棘手的模樣了，何况還有無形可象的事件，于是只得來「象事」，也呌作「會意」。一隻手放在樹上是「采」，一顆心放在屋子和飯碗之間是「寍」，有喫有住，安寍了。但要寫「寧可」的寧，却又得在碗下面放一條綫，表明這不過是用了「寍」的聲音的意思。「會意」比「象形」更麻煩，牠至少要畫兩樣。如「寶」字，則要畫一個屋頂，一串玉，一個缶，一個貝，計四樣：我看「缶」字還是杵臼兩形合成的，那麼一共有五樣。單單爲了畫這一個字，就很要破費些工夫。　　不過還是走不通，因爲有些事物是畫不出，有些事物是畫不來，譬如松柏，葉樣不同，原是可以分出來的，但寫字究竟是寫字，不能像繪畫那樣精工。到底還是硬挺不下去。來打開這僵局的是「諧聲」，意義和形象離開了關係。這已經是「記音」了，所以有人說，這是中國文字的進步。不錯，也可以說是進步，然而那基礎也還是畫畫兒。例如「菜，從草，采聲」，畫一窠草，一個爪，一株樹；三樣；「海，從水，每聲」，畫一條河，一位戴帽（？）的太太，也三樣。總之：這如果要寫字，就非永遠畫畫不成。　　但古人是並不愚蠢的，他們早就將形象改得簡單，遠離了寫實。篆字圓折，還有圖畫的餘痕，從隸書到現在的楷書，和形象就天差地遠。不過那基礎並未改變，天差地遠之後，就成爲不象形的象形字，寫起來雖然比較的簡單，認起來却非常困難了，要憑空一個一個的記住而且有些字，也至今並不簡單，例如「鸞」或「鑿」，去呌孩子寫，非練習半年六月，是很難寫在半寸見方的格子裏面的。　　還有一層，是「諧聲」字也因爲古今字音的變遷，很有些和「聲」不大「諧」的了。現在還有誰讀「滑」爲「骨」，讀「海」爲「每」呢？　　古人傳文字給我們，原是一份重大的遺產，應該感謝的。但在成了不象形的象形字，不十分諧聲的諧聲字的現在，這感謝却只好躊蹰一下了。弟弟（二）  周文　　不過，媽的哭，只在爸死的時候是號啕，用髪髻碰着棺材，數說着她受伯叔們的欺侮跟隣舍們造謠的事情；可是在現在，她只能一面小聲地抽搐着，一面偷偷地望望窗口上有沒有偷看的眼睛。她的心是分成許多方面的呵：又怕大兒子不專心，又恨二兒子不爭氣，又怕隣舍們聽見，又想着店子裏的生意。一聽見夥計們在外邊跟顧客爭論着的聲音，媽常常是馬上抹乾了眼淚，裝着沒甚麼事似的拐着小脚兒又出去應酬去了。　　雖然，弟弟並不因爲這樣就馴善起來，在棹旁老是弄着他的衣角，嘟起他的嘴唇。媽喊他：　　小周，吃飯了。」　　沒答。　　「乖，吃了吧。」　　又沒答。他甚至於把嘟起的嘴唇閉了起來。　　「你怕還要討打！」媽憤怒起來了。　　然而還是沒答。　　除非是祖父從外邊刁着烟桿進來，吼着痰的聲音，他才像老鼠般地躲開。媽見着祖父來，把哭臉也裝着笑臉迎上去。祖父是曾經把叔叔們的謠言當成眞事來痛駡媽過的。他跳起脚來駡：　　「不要臉的，滾回你的娘家去！不要汚了我們的周氏門宗！」　　弟弟就只怕他，然而也恨他不過，今天他躲出門去的時候，隔窗簾就做了一下打槍的姿式：「哺！」他嘴裏面這麼悄悄呌一聲，又跑出去和一些野孩子們學兵操，打明仗去了。　　有一天，因爲一個夥計欺負了媽，他賣了貨的錢自己裝進袋子裏被媽發覺了，他硬不承認，而且馬上就要收拾行李離開店了。那意思好像說，「是不我，你一個寡婦哪能够撑持到現在麼？」</p>

<p>春秋小西天  張恨水著　　第一回　鬼載一車關中來遠客家徒四壁渡口吊秦人　　有了這種酒香，聊可减少胸中的苦悶，所以把一顆頭假裝了打瞌睡，只管向網籃邊上就了去。他不聞尙可。一聞之後，他立刻辨白出來，這是三星白蘭地。慢說到了西北，這種酒不容易得着，就是在江浙的時候，也不能毫無緣故的開一瓶白蘭地喝。所以在他這種情形之下，竟是越聞越有味，舍不得再離開這網籃了。車子正走着，忽然停住了。張介夫猛然驚悟，抬頭看時，車子剛走過了一座平橋。這橋平平的橫在一條黃沙河上，約莫有四五十丈長。橋是不窄，寬到一丈二三，在橋的兩邊，就用長石條臥倒，當了欄干。橋面離着水面，至高不過是三尺。河面雖寬，水流却小，僅僅是在黃沙灘上，屈曲着兩道丈來闊的水道。這種橋和這種河，都是在東方所不容易看到的。橋的兩頭，都有一座牌坊，現在這汽車，就停在橋西的牌坊下。牌坊正中有兩個大字，灞橋。呵！這是灞橋。張介夫究竟是在外面混差事的人肚子裏有些鼓兒詞，他看到這兩個字，就失聲呌了出來。李士廉道：這是個名勝地方嗎？也嘸啥好看！張介夫將頭搖擺了兩下道：這是很有名的地方。古來在長安建都的時候送大官出京，大槪都送到這裏。他們說着話，那兩個德國人可下了車，有一個手上拿了一捲皮尺，在橋上由西向東走，量這個橋的長度。另一個人，却捧了照相機，上下照了幾張相。張介夫道：他們眞有這閑工夫。趙國富道：人家是研究中國的橋工。德國人的工業最好，連走一步路，都要研究。要不然，他們打敗了的國家，怎麼還能够强得起來。（六）咄咄怪事  閒居教員　　長日苦熱，昏悶巳極，嘗以『心靜自然凉』爲解暑妙法，手執一卷，闔至『女轉男身，生髭生鬚，看下生產』等，前人已筆之於書，猶憶幼時所聞怪誕之談，初非虛搆，亦有所本而來，茲揮汗誌之。以備納凉談資也可。　　萬玉山房雜記謂：康熙己已，景陵麻洋潭，有女轉男身者，面目姣好，頷下有頦，名黃喜生，出見客，客贈名仙根，居然男子，一般耆老文士，贈以詩詞，其中一短章曰：『幼讀山海經，往往愛神異，寡見復鮮聞，翻笑齊諧記，放眼看潭水，歇雨蓬烟細，人傳得仙家，咄咄稱怪事，沿柳轉花籬，披香過荷芰，令子出揖客，眉目遠淸麗，昔爲明月珠，今作珪璋器，德厚形亦化，誠動福自至，乃知天地心，樞紐可移易，握手細端相，殷勤贈名字。』　　宏治已未，隨州應山縣，民家女子生髭，長三寸餘，鄭陽一婦色美，頷下生髭三綹，約數十莖，長數寸，人目爲三髭娘云。（按宋時有酒家婦，年四十生髭，詔以爲女道士。）近代西人間有女郎生髭，已不足奇。　　成化辛丑，宿州有婦人，自脅下生一男，先是娠孕時，脅腫如癧，臨蓐昏暈不知，比甦，視脅巳平，斑創甫合，乃知爲脅下生產也。點滴  （鵑）　　往年曾集句得一聯云：「雲去雲來有時有恨。花開花落，無地無愁。」人世間的一切，都作如是觀，言愁欲愁，使人排遣不得。賢妻  顧鑫泉　　阿毛是一個出賣勞力者，住在我家的鄰近，說起他妻子的賢德，又誰個不稱讚他一聲好福氣呢？就是最近關於『一條褲』的事，鄰近人家又在互相傳揚着。　　事實是這樣的：因爲伊是一個能耐勞苦的女人，就是在火熱的夏天裏，還不住的做着工作，雖然伊穿的白短衫上沒有幾個破了的補釘，但是穿着的布褲，有似補上的布做成一般，計算這條褲的厚度，將要超過新的兩條以上，你們想穿着熱不熱呢？　　一天阿毛感覺到他妻子穿着這樣的厚褲，而從辛苦的代價中提出了若干分，買了五尺多的藍杜布和一個褲腰，給伊做一條新褲，伊很快活的接受了。第二天早晨，待伊丈夫出門後，就開始自己來裁製，還沒有到晚飯的辰光，已把那條褲兒做好啦！丈夫歸來時，伊就把白天所做的褲兒取出，請丈夫試穿，並且說：『我是整天住在家裏，從不出遠門，用不到穿新的衣服，你呢？一天到晚都在外面掙錢，衣服是應該穿得體面一些的，所以那條褲料替你做啦！假使我要褲，也儘可把你的舊褲改了穿。』　　伊丈夫聽了這番話，心眼中當然有說不出的感激；就是鄰居聽到了這件事，也非常的敬重伊，說伊是一位「賢妻」。御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯　　記得有一次，另外有一個女官，正和我在一起服侍太后，太后恰好已喝了幾口茶，想把那茶盃放下來，這位女官便走過去替伊接了；其時那盃中還有半盃茶留着，伊也許是因爲口喝太甚的緣故，竟不曾注意太后並沒有說明，要教伊代喝，便不假思索地向太后磕了一個頭，把那半盃茶喝完了。我隔着伊的肩膀，偷眼去瞧太后，只見太后，正在看着伊微笑，我不由掌不住也笑了。在太后的意思是因爲這一個過失，畢竟太小，犯不着怎樣嚴厲的責備伊，所以爽快就不說了，只把笑來驚覺伊。後來，這個女官當然便醒悟過來了。伊當然是萬分的感激太后；可是對於我，伊反而不肯輕易放過了。伊認爲我的竊笑是一種有意的挑撥，因此大有怒不可遏之勢，當塲雖不曾發作，過了一天，伊終於利用某一個機會，直截了當的數落了我一塲。伊說：　　「你眞是太聰明了·誰也够不上你。可惜你太把別人看得不値一文了！你往往歡喜玩弄人家，使人家受窘，作爲是一件有趣味的事情；人家究竟受得住受不住，你却絕對不問了。可是你要明白：論資格，人家都比你先進宮好幾年咧」！　　我對於伊所給我的這一塲數落，並不曾提出什麼反抗，也沒有把伊對於我的誤會，作什麼解說，祗是付諸一笑，馬上便丟開了。（一一五）曬臺上  拾玖　　秋威尙厲。想往靑島，上莫干山，旣非措大所敢望：逛公園，又看不慣人肉追逐的怪劇。因此，每晚只有高踞曬臺，披襟當風，倒也以極視聽之娛。　　登臺俯瞰，可以窺見那隔牆某田主家的廚房屋簾。二個烟囱，宛似一雙巨眼，時向我獰笑着。有時它又似兩張巨嘴，吐出陣陣白烟，使我宛如身處白雲中。廚房的前面，是一所果園，有豆棚瓜架之屬。鷄冠花因經不起長期抵抗暴日，已垂頭喪氣，表示屈服了。瓜架之旁，停着一副糞擔，大約肥料澆灌未盡，所以微風吹來，時挾臭氣。　　那左邊巍巍的樓房中，時時送出爵士音樂，與瓜架下婢僕笑語聲，奏成交響曲。園的右邊，是一條官弄，官弄裏有一只翕子沒精打采地矗立着。每當夜靜更深之際，翕子裏的守夜者不知慨嘆些什麼，老是在長吁短嘆，使人毛髪竦然。他還是紅丸子癮未曾過足吧？還是在詛咒着人類的不平等呢？還是恨育那野犬追逐，擾他的淸夢呢？這，只有他自己心裏明白了。　　街上的野狗眞是多！狂吠，互追，鬧個不休，把山東大漢「賣大包子」的喊聲也罩住了。曬臺之下，鼾聲如雷，佐以遠處傳來的夫婦勃谿聲及近處送來的大哭小喊聲；一句句，一聲聲，聲聲入耳，想不到曬臺乘凉，可以得這許多靜中之趣。那些往靑島，上莫干山的幸運兒，不知他們的靜趣何如。大門開了  士英世界珍聞留學生在東京  奐氷　　我有一位朋友，在日本東京留學，他寄給我的信札，在報告日常生活的片叚裏面，有時帶着一種頑皮，幽默得合理的語調，來表現異國之觀感，且也返映出其他留學生生活的一斑，讀之頗堪回味？現在把它公開數節于下：　　（一）　　前天有位名大學教授問我：「中國靑年，是否有三個願望：（一）住西洋房子，（二）討日本老婆，（三）吃中國菜。」　　這位先生是有名的「支那通，」他的話雖含有調侃意味，可不能輕視。　　中國自海禁開放以來，學到些甚麼？怕只是些享樂的東西，……只是些個人墮落的享樂。大衆娛樂的設備，上海這樣大的都市，也很感缺乏。蘇州是一壺早茶，八圈麻雀，優哉游哉，聊以卒歲！　　（二）　　在神戶駐一日半，到寶塚看少女歌舞，壓台爲五百少女所合演的歌劇：「花詩集，」是日本歌舞第一，歌喉，服裝，佈景，分幕，音樂都規模西洋而加以織巧出之，面貌亦都姣好，可說全國精英薈萃之神移神移，不過有一缺點，乃其足踝似嫌短耳。這是沒法補救的，然而大醇小疵，也不能以一眚掩之啊！　　（三）　　天天讀日文報紙，對于國內消息，靈聰而不正確。我素來抱隔岸看火主義，現在隔東海黃海而觀，似乎更覺淸凉了。　　（四）　　東京留學生給我的印象不好，十分之七見日本娘都有恨晚之感，他們問我預備弄日本老婆不，我對他們笑笑，你歎靑春虛擲不虛擲？　　（五）　　叢林小坡，芳隣接德川公坻，坻內松栢，皆六十年以上物，幽鳥託巢其上者至多。我之室處地甚高，有憑凌公坻之槪。隔牆松栢，綠我書案，皆我所有物。晨起東方一片紅雲。便有千百小鳥環鳴，如聽咸池而舞韶獲。（這位朋友自得其樂如此！）……人家笑我現在所居者爲鬼之國，而我嗤他們附近只是人肉市塲。…　　（六）　　澁谷驛前，咖啡館與藝者，亦足稱一時勝觀。入夜粉白黛綠與霓虹相映發，有疑非人間，止應天上之感。但我常是孤燈枯旅，寂寞之至。你臨維也納（上海舞塲之一，）我却不曾到威尼斯，－－驛前咖啡店，確有此名。－－不堪對比。　　（七）　　日本料理，無非味增澤庵之類，有生魚，便是上菜，而居然杯盤常空，自歎胃口之佳。上海祀孔講話（續）  上海通社　　不知道這一次祀孔的儀節，和以前有什麼不同的地方沒有。　　再說上海的文廟，在民國二十年十二月十四日實行改做了市立民衆教育館。該館並爲推廣民衆的見識將原來珍藏在瀧掃局的祀孔器服，呈請市教育局允許前往接收，過來，整理一過，於二十一年八月，即在孔子廟開放「祀孔彝器陳列所」，內列祭器一百四十五件；祭服十件；樂器六十件，舞器十三件，任人觀覽。　　現在，這些祭器，祭服，服器，器舞，不再僅僅乎展覽，而要眞的用得着了。那民衆教育館。也許就在不久的將來仍舊變做神聖的文廟吧。（完）</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言旱魃在地球上  立齋　　一九三四，這倒世界之大霉的年頭！不但有劍拔弩張的戰爭危機，而且有許多國家都遭其殃的旱災。　　談到災荒問題，就我國人的「國貨觀念」立論，當然應列之於「天發殺機」之類，所謂「在刧難逃」者是也。所以，中國人不遇災荒則已，遇災必禱，而且每禱必「靈」。因爲如果禱之而災消，固然是「至誠格天」，但縱然禱之而天災更烈，也只能說是「天怒未已」。總之，只怪兩足動物該死，而主宰萬有的上蒼或上帝，却永遠是正確的。這種道理，只有「天曉得」，人類一向是難窺宇宙之秘的。　　今年旱魃普遍的猖獗於地球之上。在中國，在美洲，在蘇聯，都發生最普遍而酷烈的旱災。阿拉不才，從有色的眼鏡中去認識問題，我竟能由這幾個國度對於今年旱災之反應中，看出中美蘇三大國家的民族性，國民性，政治作風……等。讀者將疑我爲「瞎三話四」乎？「你且聽了」：　　先從「國貨旱災」說起。咱們這泱泱乎不失爲大國之風的國度，對於古已有的天災，一向自有其應付之恒則的。吾華釀災弭禍的唯一方式，就是祈禱。歷代帝王間的列祖列宗，不斷有祭天地，祈禎祥，消災禍的花樣，固然是史不絕書。卽在民國，我們老百姓和督軍，大帥，名流之羣，也差不多年年都在爲了「我饑我溺」而「泣告上蒼」。民國十八九年間甘陝一帶的大災荒，就有若干大人物在「神而明之」的舉行時輪金剛法會，普濟齋醮等，梅博士及其他名角之羣，也在南北各地，表演賑災義務戲，曾有無數的善士仁人，一面慨然解囊，一面從他們「繞樑三日」的藝術欣賞中，爲災民也許掬了幾點「同情之淚」。不過問題之糟，只糟在中國地面太大，人口太多。所以甘陝奇災，一死六七百萬人口，在數量上簡直等於一個倫敦或紐約的大都市之毀滅。然而當善士仁人們參加過某某法會或聽完黛玉葬花之後，對於上千萬人口（所謂同胞）之塡於溝壑，名登鬼錄，那精神上的震盪，却並不怎樣深刻。從那時直到現在，旱災，水災，外禍，國難，又是旱災，這幾座三煞七刦之神，一直踐踏着這東方古國的領域，表演走馬燈式的舞蹈。同胞旣長此湼槃不盡，而那些以祈禱爲職業的活佛，名流，居士，等男子，信女之人羣，也就不斷在「晝夜奔忙」，然而祈禱終於是於蒼生有益的。六月不雨，七月禁屠，再不雨，就法會齋醮，八月再不雨，再等待，再做佛事，只要雷公雷母龍神沒有「出洋考察」，終歸有「天降甘霖」的一天。在這樣一個「天怒未已」，「大刦方興」的時代，我們老百姓除了聽天，除了忍耐而外，難道還有怎樣法子麼？　　至於美國人，一向是充滿了「經特曼」的氣分，其應付這次損失不下五十萬萬元美金的旱災，自然也與中國不同。爲了旱荒而在禮拜堂唸「亞們」的牧師教徒們，固然頗不乏人。但羅斯福和史璜生那些大腦袋人物，却並不中意請教上</p>

<p>帝。他們一面忙於拉李維諾夫進日內瓦，一面忙於造飛機戰艦。金元政府固然要從事於救災運動的大動員，但主要的着眼點，還是在用砲彈和刺刀，把世界地圖重新畫過。　　最後，談到那色彩未免「豈有此理」的「羅宋人」。在那國度裏，今年也發生蔓延歐亞兩洲的大旱災。照一般的推斷，今年至少應該餓死幾百萬紅軍或「來路共匪」，再加上千萬的農民來陪死，好讓德國的希特拉或日本的荒木貞夫之流來「浮一大白」。「不幸」，俄國毛子果然厲害，靠了農民之有組織的努力和爭鬬，竟戰勝了旱魃，獲得比平時不相上下的收成。這奇績不但要氣壞了一切同仇敵愾的反莫斯哥派，甚至於要嚇倒上帝。　　綜觀以上事實，我們可知同是一樣的旱災，而各國的應付却大有不同。大體說來，中國人精神生活的特點，是聽天由命和滿不在乎，這也可以說是「偉大」美國人似乎信上帝，而其實是信毒瓦斯和大砲。「俄國毛子則直可謂之曰「天不怕，地不怕」。因爲他們太兇，所以大家要退讓三分。病與人生  乃碩　　五年來我就是這麼的，經過一個暑期的熬煎，體重一百三十多磅，總是瘦减到僅僅百磅左右，年年如此，彷彿暑天是我的「對頭」，沒有一絲兒交情。這也罷了，秋季到了應該有一種新的轉機，把體重回復到先前的磅數，帶着一般人的笑顏來把「秋」讚頌一番。但又不然，秋對於我却更施着進一步的殘忍的懲罰，五年來我在秋季總要害一塲病，年年如此，任憑怎的預防，也是免不掉的。　　說起來，「賤體」雖不甚强，但也並不怎樣孱弱，至少我自己有一個信念，－能够抵擋過任何苦痛的熬煎。前幾年，有過隆冬的雪夜僅僅蓋一條薄舊不堪的棉被而沒有凍出病來，一二八後在回鄕的火車上整整的與騰挨餓過兩天，也還是一般的壯旺，不，當我到達家門時，先母出來接我，我記得她還說過我胖了些的話呢。　　但是秋天一到，我就要準備病，（因爲預防是絕對不可能的），這種病之於我，說是「季候病」，眞是恰當不過。其實說起來，又並非怎樣的嚴重，所以，雖則年年病倒，却還不曾交掉一條命。病的類分，就是肚瀉，從開始以至痊可，往往是一個星期左右，在這一個星期中，延診服藥是毫不中用的，雖然是不中用，但一星期的期滿了，却又不醫也會好了。　　不過，最難過的也就是這一個星期，急的時候眞有些來不及下褲。口裏彿彿很需要吃東西，吃起來却是一點兒辯不出味，而且也「格格不相入」，連一隻水菓，都嚼不上半個就厭棄了，肚子裏却偏偏有那麼多的東西瀉出來，瀉到最後完全是水了，好多日，才告休止。　　病，我本來已有相當的經騐，（這句話實在說得太不成樣兒了）十六年整整的病了一年，我並來大害怕。獨獨這種「季候病）使我感到分外的憂懼。好好的一個身體，肚瀉上一個星期以後，就怎樣也是一個鬼像了。攬鏡一照，眞是不由得要發抖一陣，隨卽就有好幾種感想湧上心頭來，旋廻又旋廻個不休，直至心疲力竭的時候，才迷離恍惚的殭臥下去。　　生平我覺得人生怎樣也是痛苦的！寶貴者羣吧，雖則在物質的享樂上能達到最高的峯度，恣欲所欲，應樂盡樂，但當他病到速「牛醫生「都不奏神效了，其痛苦也就無法擺脫，其痛苦也總是美滿中的缺陷。至若貧苦的人們吧，那更不待說了，身體健旺時要遭生活的磨折，磨折得簡直呼吸不過來氣。一至疾病臨身，更是苦不堪言，連平日所賴以抵抗奮鬥的生素都沒有了。上帝是這樣的虐待人們。眞使人氣憤，嘆息呵！所以我想，人生是根本沒有什麼幸福的，也似乎沒有什麼意義，若有的話，就只有永生不病，終身是一個健綁綁的鐵漢。我一生就最羨慕那般無病的康健人們，只有他們才眞正是幸福的天使。有些人是頗以爲「害病是人生的一種藝術」，這話，我不知他們是怎樣說出的？多愁善病者呀，你們的生趣，幸福在那兒呢。　　人生是冷酷的，是寂寞的呀！這是多少人在呌着的。果然不差，我實深深的有此感覺。可是，人畢竟是感情的動物，平時固很過不來冷酷，寂寞的生活：而在病中，則更是急切的想衝破這種惡魔似的隔膜，從而獲得人生的慰藉的一面。當我把病了的消息傳給了友朋後，他們來信的安慰，使我讀了是多麼的感謝呵。更是勞駕三數位來探望，簡直使我興奮得像病是完全脫却了身似的，精神特別的好，心情特別的寬適我想，病，是沒有藥治的，只有至誠的友誼的安慰才是病的勁敵，至少我一個人是這麼相信着。（完）如夢令  蕰志　　如果讓巨大的鐵輪代表了時代，那末就是它，這殘酷的鐵的巨輪！它把現在輾成了過去，把過去輾成了記憶，又把記憶輾成了夢。　　而如今是：連這烟一般的往事的夢都消失了呢。　　（不是那兒有着：故鄕的小草，憂鬱味的園子，糢糊的母親底臉，和兒時的憧憬的眼睛與笑的嗎？不錯，那兒是也有着給埋葬了的童年的心，童年的世界的。）　　幼年的太陽是夢一般的。　　可是：也記念着過去了的社會呢。　　（過去的日子是繁盛的，社會也是「繁盛的」（？）；人們耕着地，打着杖，做着官，做着買賣，什麼全家一點沒有關連似的。街上的大餅油條祗賣二個子兒，白粥是一個子一碗。人們做「江白大」，做買辦，做小官僚，做金融事業。）　　誰也瞧不到後面隱藏着一次大風景的序幕呢。　　繁榮的時代哪。自家兒的享用是豐盛的，豐盛的享用者的眼中的社會，該有一個繁榮的面目了吧？對的，我說，人家也說：「這時代是不錯的。」　　然而，但道這也能稱作夢的嗎？如果是的，那麼整部的人類史代表的是什麼呢？可是，瞧着那攬不淸楚的一煞間，眞有點像夢一般的糢糊呢：世界不是變了嗎？是的小官僚的興起，沒落，再興起的變化過程中，自家兒的豐盛的享用也給毀滅咧。聽見的是：自己的厄運，耕農的厄運，地主的厄運，做買賣的厄運。　　（那是一個什麼樣子的世界呢？）　　那是一個什麼樣子的世界呢？－多問有什麼用！自家兒需要的不再是生活的享用，而是生活的必需了。生存的本能是能呌人勇敢起來的，帶着挨餓的驚慌，挺身走了出來：「到社會裏面去看一看吧。」　　鬥爭着，生活着，學習着。　　（人說：假如回憶是夢一般的話至少，夢是不値得多想的。　　人說：過去是靡爛的，還不像一隻不値錢的破鞋一機的把它拋去嗎？　　人說：在生活的駭濤中亂滾着的人，是不應當有過去的。　　人說………）　　於是轉了個身：「廉價的感傷主義者啊，」嘈笑地，撫弄着夢一般的尾巴。　　嘈笑的不是別的，是生活，是生活的本身呢。　　這麼着：便狠一狠心，把過去的夢的尾巴割掉了。　　瞧這對白；　　（－自家兒是沒有過去的，也沒有未來的：回憶和希望都是紳士階級的手飾呢？　　－這便是說什麼都沒有的嗎？　　－怎麼呢？有的不是眞實的「現在」嗎？過去和未來都是夢一般的，祇有現存的現實才是眞的，血淋淋的。　　－可是「現在」的血淋淋的也會是夢的呢；而夢一般的不也將是血淋淋的嗎、　　－這個我不願意想。　　－當然你能不想的：「在生活中游泳着的人，生活的險濤中的美人魚啊！」　　沈默了，難堪地，然而又是興味地吟味着那嘈弄。）　　「生活的駭濤中的美人魚啊，「可是，過去和未來都是夢一般的。阿松老太  吳飛　　「咳！咳！咳！咳！」一陣子急促的連續咳嗆，知道阿松老太又點着煤油燈起來了。　　的確，阿松老太每天在天還沒有亮透，祗要見瓦縫裏才鑽進一縷白光來的時候，她便咳着起身了。她捺着胸脯，特別把咳聲抑得低些：咳得響了，生怕驚醒了她兒子媳婦的好夢，給他們駡。可是因爲要想忍住咳聲，而用力過猛了些，所以累得身上一件打滿了補釘的老布衫，常常是濕透的；然而對於這老病她倒也滿不在乎。她依舊左手捺着胸脯，一拐一跌的去做她每天應做的工作！洗鑊，掃地，抹桌，燒臉水，燒早飯。她一一舒齊了，只要侍候她兒子媳婦起來，洗臉吃飯好了。然而這種工作也是不容易討好的，譬如燒飯的時候水放得太多了些，興隆－她的兒子，就要駡她老不中用的：　　「老不中用的東西，好去死了哪！隔壁阿金媽媽比你年紀還要大兩歲呢！她還能够帮她兒子去砍些柴來，或割割羊草，不像你連燒一頓飯都不成樣子的。」她倒並不動氣，只顫顫地站在傍邊陪笑。　　「今天水不知怎的多放了些，明天仔細些吧！」可是菜餚却尤其不好調度；假如放得太鹹了些，她的媳婦就說她惡心惡意，鹹了好讓他們不好吃。煮得淡了，又說她自己吃淡齋，別人可不能跟她一起吃淡齋。油多倒了些，倒說是打翻了油船，她有意把東西糟塌。油太少了，又要說是猪玀食。她的爲人眞够難了，這也不好，那亦是歹，說來說去，他們祗多了她一個人，怪她不早死。然而又有誰會來可憐她呢？倒還是隔壁的金狗嫂，時常去同情她的。一天，她又同金狗嫂在一處嘆苦了：　　阿松太太！你年紀這樣大了；好省力些吧！有許多事情，應該讓你媳婦去做做來，况且你的咳嗽病又是這樣的厲害！……」金狗嫂好意的說。但她聽着搖了搖頭，已經枯陷的眼圈兒上現出了紅痕，眼睛裏也似乎有些潤濕，那額上的縐紋更深了幾分。　　「不！吾只怪自己命苦！興隆四歲就死了爺，他爺又沒有遺產掉下來，只有兩段身體；好容易，靠了十個指頭，巴巴的抱興隆領大了，去年又給他娶了一房親，吾的心願總算完了。誰知他聽了那妖精的話，沒有了良心………」　　你只老賤！下會得來；又在講兒子媳婦的壞話了。衰！吾是不會老的，馬上就死給你看，你可快樂了嗎？」當她的話頭還沒斷落，嘩啦啦一聲，興隆娘子已經從籬笆那面躟到了籬笆這邊，拍</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>手跳脚，像雌老虎般地駡了過來，只唬得她一聲不作的望屋子裏溜了進去。金狗嫂也怪無趣地提着一籃髒衣服望河灘頭走去了。　　「你這老不死的，去告忤逆好了，忤逆了你，呌你兒子去吃官司坐監牢去，橫豎有這種賤貨會帮你的，你人緣好，人家會愛惜你，還不呌人家去養你呢！」　　興隆娘子獨個子，越駡越起勁，愈跳愈高興；她簡直像着了瘋魔一般，狂天狂地的。　　阿松老太縮在屋子裏，聽她駡，聽她吵，一聲也不敢響；祇戰戰兢兢的在洗碗，和收拾檯上的殘菜。　　興隆從鎭上茶館裏回來，聽了他老婆的話，又很痛快的駡了她一頓老不中用，老賤。　　聽說，阿松老太這天晚飯也沒有吃，伏在枕上流掉了很多的老淚；但第二天又照常的起來了。業餘信箱他預備自殺了  編者編者先生：　　前幾天，有友人馬莉從鄕間來，呌我解答一個疑難的問題：否則，他决心預備自殺了。　　事情是這樣的：　　馬莉本是一個鄕間區立小學的教員，三八年華，營「唱大狗呌小狗跳」業有年，聰明伶俐，幼有「神童」之號，四年前馬莉覓得一女子名阿娟者，遂與之訂婚，照理，一對曠男怨女，從此可有歸宿了。詎料四年於茲，馬莉又與另一女子結不解緣，他們的行蹤，差不多名聞全鎭，但某女士是一個生長在舊禮教家庭中的人，母親早歿，父親頑固成性，以爲此事有碍家規，就百般阻撓，然而他們的愛苗已屆成熟時期，對於外來的攻擊，反鞏固了他們的意志，且某女士也抱定非馬莉莫嫁之宗旨，於是問題就來啦：　　一，某女士可否不得家長同意，與馬莉自行訂婚！　　二，與阿娟女士離婚，需要何種手續！　　三，要賠償對方損失費否！　　四，另有一法，卽與阿娟不結婚，不解約，自己與某女士實行同居，可否！　　先生原是黑夜海中的明燈，茫茫大地的南針，對於上述數問題，希望給一個詳細的解答，如是，不但讀者幸甚，馬莉幸甚，某女士幸甚，卽有同等情形的朋友也當銘感五中呢！　高松苓　　答：令友之事，難有兩全之法，卽使决心自殺，亦屬咎由自取，渠旣與阿娟女士訂婚，便應當精誠相愛，不該再與其他女子發生戀愛，致形成今日三角戀愛之悲劇，同時令友與阿娟女士訂婚之消息，在小小鄕村裏面，某女士當亦不會不知，已知道「使君有婦」，仍與之「要好」，男女「要好」之結果，戀愛問題自會隨之而起，陷自身於悲劇中，亦屬自招痛苦，惟事已至此，解决之法，不外兩端，一令友與阿娟女士，乾脆解約，對方旣無過失，自當賠償損失，至於需要何種手續，祗須向地方法院申請解約而已，二令友從速抑制情感，與某女士「割愛」，當然「割愛」之理由，應向某女士剴切申述，使渠亦了解令友目前之苦衷，倘令友能有如此果敢之精神，預想某女士當亦不至於不肯放鬆個人之幸福而任陷阿娟女士於痛苦之境也。如果某女士不得家長之同意，與令友自行訂婚，或令友不與阿娟結婚，亦不解約，而與某女士實行同居，同樣爲法律所不許，據來函所示，令友與阿娟女士，雙方並無惡感，則還以保持原議爲佳，不識足下亦以爲善否？自我職業介紹　　呂化仁君，粵籍，二十九歲，法國巴黎大學文科哲學系畢業，通英，法文及滬語，國語，現願就一切能勝任之職業，薪金不計，通信處，郵政總局，存局候領郵件處，黃遠羣先生收轉。　　某女士，師範畢業，能操滬語及國語，曾任家庭教師及小學教員有年，現願找一相當職業，如欲聘請者請通訊至楊樹浦路眉州路留春里五號，沈女士轉。　　貞女士，安徽桐城籍，師範畢業，曾任家庭教師有年，現願任上述職務，如欲聘請者請通訊至楊樹浦路眉州路留春里五號，沈女士轉。　　某君，年十九，初中程度，能乘脚踏車，現欲謀一職務，薪金不計，備有殷實舖保，通信處北四川路東橫浜路大陸里五號俞君轉。　　雲女士，年二十三，江蘇籍，初中程度，茲願担任相當工作，最好能供給膳宿，薪金不計，有意延聘者請至施高塔路恒豐里六十六號二樓。小說五家鎭上一件大事（七）  張一蘋　　富生眼快，輕輕地說爸來了。各人隨卽保持着原有的態度，伍老大爺故意捧起水烟袋抽烟，富公公躊躇着走到他面前，呌了二聲大伯伯才說：　　「……幾年來委實負了許多債，我把二弟的財產代管了這末十多年，現在這樣交代弟媳自然是說不過去，所以內人……」他說到這裏，望着衆人的面孔，見沒有動靜，才接下去說：「所以內人情願將花粉田（妻子由母家帶來的田租－－作者註）塡足，不過，不過，富生討親時負的債，我，我實在沒有能力了。」　　費勁地說完了話，他搓着雙手，汗珠從額角上掛下來也不去理會。他直逼着伍老太爺的面孔，惟一的希望伍老太爺能够從輕發落。　　伍老太爺抽罷一通烟，緩緩地把水烟袋放到紫檀几上，才啟口問：　　「富明，姪媳倒底嫁多少花粉田過伍家來？她旣寶貝富生，討親時的債欵也可一併淸還了，省得人家說晚娘厲害呢！」　　這是一件五家鎭喧傳過一時的事：富公公的塡房母家雖也是鎭上的望族，但傳到她哥哥朱全貴手裏，已是外强中乾。朱氏是個老小姐，不知爲了什麼關係年輕時候她就立誓不願嫁人，父母看她立志堅决，遺囑分配三分之一田產由她自己保管，所以朱氏在五家鎭是很有一點聲名的：其實她脾氣怪僻，性情咆哮也是重大的原因。　　自父母雙亡之後，朱全貴是手足之情倒也相安無事，但是嫂嫂見她分去了三分之一財產，婦女心地却不願意起來，不免冷言冷語諷刺她。朱氏的意志自然也活動起來。適巧富公公花燭故世，媒婆就蹩上門來和她哥哥商議，居然一說而成。那時好事者編了一首山歌曰：　　五家橋邊黑牆門，　　運道眞好老婆蹺，（死的意思－作者註）　　討個活寶進門來，　　田地三千哈哈笑。　　這是由羨慕而生的嫉妬。山歌編成了，許多小孩子就成天應在富公公的門前唱起來。富公公也不去干涉。後來知道朱氏的田租都是蕩田，（收成最壞的田－作者註）這首山歌也自然的消滅了。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　電影專刊美國各界的電影淸潔運動（下）  米同　　～～大主教痛責製片家～～　　～～西席地米爾的辯護～～　　以下是西席地米爾氏代好萊塢電影業辯護的談話：　　「我對於好萊塢的罪惡，不管它們是什麼，並沒有迴護的意思，但我對於現在的改良運動，因爲它是尋求好萊塢的毀滅的，却有幾句話要說說。我覺得無論什麼運動，它的目的是毀滅了以遂一種人毀滅的慾念的，都是無從加以寬恕的。譬如一棵樹的一個椏枝，有了腐爛的地方，難道你就要將全棵樹砍下來的嗎？粗鄙的東西，無論在銀幕上，書本裏面，或是在報紙上，却是不需要而不可避免的。粗鄙的東西，是由懶惰的腦筋產生的。懶惰的腦筋，是不能創造有意味的東西的。我在戲院裏，或是在書本裏，都時常遇見粗鄙的東西。每天早晨，報紙裏亦一定供給些可怖的記載。但是比方說，我因爲遇見了這種粗鄙的東西，就從此不進戲院，不看書，不讀報，我能算一個有知識的人嗎？當我說我並不要爲好萊塢的罪惡辯護的時候，我要告訴你好萊塢，或是電影工業，並不是一個簡單的單位，而多多數的單位，在不同的頭腦之下，合組而成的。現在因爲幾個少數份子的罪惡，而全部受處分了。難道這可以說是公平的嗎？　　「好萊塢的時常爲一種或他種勢力所攻擊，是不可避免的。人類的思想和注意，都要受好萊塢的指揮。好萊塢的觀衆，約略計之，在全球各國，至少有六萬萬人。因爲它有了這種思想上的鼓運力，它就有了威權。因爲它有了威權，所以常受外界的襲擊。好萊塢所提出的思想，倘能些徵的加以討論，就引起了一般改良家對於影片，不分皂白的攻擊。照他們的說法，美國的罪潮，完全是好萊塢造成的。但是英國亦放映同樣的影片，他們有沒有罪潮呢？再論到罪潮的本身，我想一般的改良家，先應當反躬自省一下。改良家不就是禁酒令的製造者嗎？而禁酒令却就是罪惡滋生的根源。道德造成了罪惡，要美國從那次「榮譽的試騐」所造成的惡果恢復起來，不知道還有幾十年哩。改良家已往的主張，可笑的地方亦不少。他們曾經攻擊汽車，說它是違反人類天性的東西。他們說走路亦是罪惡，除非是在星期中走到禮拜堂裏去。我不相信他們所說的社會罪惡，有一半是由好萊塢造成的。我不相信小孩子的心靈，能因爲看影戲而受毒害，以至於流而爲匪。好萊塢並沒有創造人類天性的能力。　　要論到反對淫穢的影片，我自問我的努力，亦不後於人，但我覺得改良派所提出的法令，並不是適當的答案。亦不是電影檢查。我們有了檢查，但是檢查的人，却意見各不相同。在沃海華認爲不道德而禁映的片子，到了本薛文尼就通過了，或是在本薛文尼並不通過的片子，在沃海華到通過了。難道道德亦分區域的嗎？要是改良家不有運動，沒有飯吃，請他去反對仇殺，綁票，搶刦等等好了，何必一定要和電影作對呢？我相信在相當的程度，好萊塢亦有咎由自取之道。有幾個影界裏的叛徒，他們製作了些不需要的淫蕩影片，惹起了無所不在的改良家的反對。但是這種事態，早已由好萊塢自動更正了。好萊塢的自身，已經覺悟到淫穢不潔的片子，並不足以號召而獲贏利。他們自己已經組織了自動檢查的機關，遠在一般改良家開始攻擊好萊塢之前哩。」　　確實的，一九三三年所認爲最偉大成功的片子，其中有「小婦人」Little　Woman,「亂世春秋」Cavalcade,和「太夫人」Lady　for　a　Day等，統通是提倡人倫道德，有功於世道人心和作品。一九三四上半年的出品，現在還沒有統計，但是可以說淫侈片子的末日已到了。現在惟一的危機是什麼？是一般改良家自以爲得到了勝利而居功，並且以爲他們的運動是對的而益加努力於他們的破壞工作也！（完）影片談評評「慮嘯猿啼」  凌鶴　　－－山西映－－　　聰明的製片商人，當他們投機的時候，也必然的要顧及到投機的技術或手段，否則一味笨拙的投機，他必然會遭受着極嚴重的失敗。譬如說，野獸之類的影片，在獵奇的作用上。它是會得着良好的營業效果的。例如「人猿泰山」能够閧動一時，在電影藝術上仍有着良好的收獲，因此電影藝術上的成功，到底决定了它營業上的成功。同時，製片者以很大的資本到菲洲去採取眞實的景物，這對於小市民層觀衆的好奇心理，不是不可滿足的。可是中國的電影商人在攝製獸片的時候，他們祇能够以人扮裝猩猩，以人扮裝老虎，更在外國獸片剪接一些陳舊的膠片，這樣的方法，自然不能滿足觀衆好奇的慾念。至於營業上的慘敗，那更是必然的結果了。　　我們理解，以中國二三千元資本的小公司，遠往菲洲或緬甸諸地去攝起獸物的眞像，無論如何是做不到的事，因此他們應當度德量力的攝製一些經濟能力所能攝製的作品。但是他們却要投機取巧的粗製濫造，這種製片態度，就不免破壞中國電影文化運動。　　誰也得承認，小公司的出品，所以常常降落在水平綫以下的原因，乃是經濟的拮据，因此作品上的偷工减料，人材上的淺薄庸俗，都是必然的結果。我們固然不必勸告各小公司集中資本，形成較大的公司，但是以很嚴正的態度，採取農村或工廠的題材，至少在佈景方面，是不會化費多少的。這樣，假使正確的把握主題，很嚴正的爲電影文化而努力，無論如何是會獲得觀衆之同情與原諒的，當部份的仍有多少缺點的時候。　　特別是所謂人材方面，更使我們大爲失望。有人說，中國有些導演，不但是不懂得電影藝術，甚至於連常識都是非常缺乏的。譬如說，中國不是熱帶，所以沒有大的棕梠或其他的熱帶植物，可是我們常看見幾個獸片中的上一畫面是松杉之類的樹木，而下一畫面，在同一地帶却又有了椰子。「蠻荒歷險記」是如此，這「虎嘯猿啼」又是如此。我們懂得那椰子之類的外景，是從外國影片中剪來的，但是和劇情不合，我們是不需要的。再說罷，假使有常識的話，我們中國現在所遺留的未開化或半開化的士人，有裸夷，種種，他們的服裝是怎樣？他們的生活習慣又是怎樣？導演在未開始拍攝之前，對於他們一定得有相當瞭解，或者是從書本上去求得我們的常識，可是「虎嘯猿啼」的導演，却連這一點都不能做到，他祇是很淺薄的從菲洲取材的獸片中去學取在土人鼻子上帶大環，裸着上身，手裏拿着長矛，而且女人也裸體作草裙舞，將中國的「邊荒之區」搬到菲洲去。這不是太缺乏常識嗎？　　但是在另一方面，導演者對於女人的裸浴，却毫無必要的來上二次之多，（而且女演員們都不會游泳，祇能裝着游泳的姿態，）所謂奇人會以水菓去獻奉給以人扮裝的母猿。人扮的老虎會來撲人，木製的鱷魚也會噬人，更可笑的是全未開化的土人，也會懂得三民主義，甚至於母猿養大的奇人也可以說出文謅謅的話來。　　如上種種，根本就談不上什麼電影藝術，所謂「墾荒」或者是「宣化工作」的主題，那只是好聽的名詞而已。評「世界沒日」  異之　　Delnge　-大上海-　　這是RKO跟着「金剛」的賣座而攝製的一部不近情理的荒誕影片。　　照故事講，這影片分成了不相融接的三大段落，第一段，是大地震，大海嘯，而世界陷於滅亡。第二段是殘存着的人們的生活鬥爭。第三段是一個男子和兩個女人間的三角戀愛。在攝製者的目的，大約第一段是用「金剛」式的攝影技巧，來使觀衆看一看大紐約毀滅的情景。第二段是用三十年前的連續劇和西部劇的方法，使觀衆看一些「魯濱孫漂流記」式的勇壯的原人的姿態，第三段是用傳統的美國風的三角戀愛的描寫，來調劑小市民的口味。在製片者的「生意眼」，這種配置也許已經是慘淡經營了。但是不幸得很，這影片除了在意識上表明原作者S.F.Wright的無智，淺見，和荒誕之外，在編劇J.Goodrioh，B.Duff和導演F.E.Feist　Jr.，也暴露了不可補塡的缺點。第一段的所謂世界末日的情景，僅對我們給了一個類似兒戲的印象，在災害襲來之前的描寫，和Trick與眞景（例如暴風雨的塲面）的聯接，這都表示導演的粗雜與無能，尤其在第二段的西部劇式的手法的陳套，第三段的三角關係之處理的不當，如Shannon和Blackmar的關係，以及他們兩個與L.Wilson之間的連絡，都是充分可以使有鑒賞力的觀衆顰蹙的事情。第三段，劇中要表現的是一個男子介在妻子與情人之間的苦悶，但是結果，在觀衆得到的印象，好像得不到解决的方法而苦悶着並不是劇中人的男角，而反是導演這部戲的Feist　Jr.了。　　看完了戲的印象，倒很像知堂老人所說的在「街頭」聽了一次「談鬼」。我們想，祇有對於生存失却了自信的人，纔會將人類的力量估計得這樣的微弱與無聊。我們想，人類是有力量征服這一切災害的。電影小說爭愛得子（Doctor　　Monica）（九）  緹雲　　自從那天過後，蒙尼卡百計尋求那種事態的解答；她雖然在現實之中行走着，但是那現實却離開已往所經歷的，慣常的快樂生活太遠了。她在她的心中，明明知道事過境遷之後，痛苦會漸漸由麻木而消失的，但是過了幾個禮拜，每天早晨醒了起來，以及無時無刻，到處都覺得一種內心的空虛喪失，使她覺得她於約翰的愛，是無份的了，是永久不能恢復的了。這種感想，實在比一切的現實的邏輯，還要眞切。她長時間的工作着，不停留地辛苦着，想呌她的頭腦，沒有一刻停留閑想的餘隙，但是到了洗手的片刻，她的思想中已經充滿了一種不可名狀的愁苦；到了吃飯的時候，一種迴腸蕩氣的喪失的感覺，已經在她腹中起了暈浪式的作用，而使她食不下嚈了；到了晚上，她將自己擲在床上，去尋求黑暗的安慰，但是亦不能立即得到睡眠，而一種可怖的寂寞又抓住她的心頭，使她呼吸短促了。同時曼麗因爲蒙尼卡對她的態發生了激變，也因而冷淡而感覺到創傷。但她却萬萬想不到那個秘密，她的丈夫就是那嬰孩的父親，今被蒙尼卡知道的。安娜當然亦不肯告訴她。後來有一天，蒙尼卡突然在工作之間暈倒了。她的同伴知道她心境不大佳，而工作得太過份了，就呌她去長期休息一下子。蒙尼卡雖然醒了過來，但是身體仍舊非常軟弱。她點着頭答應了。她說她祗要休息兩個禮拜。她說她的丈夫在山上，她可以去陪他玩玩。她咬緊了她無血色的嘴唇，不讓它抖，她知道她的休假，恰和她預定的計劃吻合的。　　在那休假告終的前一晚，約翰將一隻小船搖到湖中一個他們最喜歡的地點，那裏他們常常在看着太陽下山的。他們靜坐着，默然不語了半天，蒙尼卡然後像做夢似的說道：「這次的遊玩，我活着一生一世，總不會忘記的……我會牢牢地記住，如同記住我們的蜜月一樣」。約翰輕輕伸過手去，將她接着說道：「你知道，我們應當常常這樣。這是於我們，都有益處的！自從我們來到了這裏，我一本新書的稿子，已經完全成功了」。蒙尼卡仰着頭，靠在他的肩上，徐徐的說道：「你太甜蜜了。我心裏不提多末感激哩」。約翰低下頭來望着她，覺得有些奇怪的問她道：「你這話怎麼說的？感激？」蒙尼卡道：「但是我確實是感激你的。你陪我玩了這麼幾天，使我一切其他的事情都忘記了」。她停了一回又說道：「你想，我們好像兩個古老式的夫妻……你使這一個禮拜，成了覺美無比的羅曼斯了」。約翰輕輕吻着牠的腮道：「我們中間是永久爲羅曼斯的」。她忽然看見她流着眼淚，就問道：「怎麼啦？爲什麼哭呀」？蒙尼卡連忙眨着眼睛，將眼淚收了回去。她說：「恐怕是我覺得彩雲易散，好景不常的緣故吧。不過，無論如何，這不是一個美滿的結局嗎」？她說着，她的內心正在與愛情和美麗告別而碎了呢。約翰一邊摸着紙烟，一面很高興地說道：「這並不是結局呀。我們所要的，不是還在着嗎」？約翰尋紙烟，尋了半天尋不着，然後說道：「天不早了。我們不要等天黑吧。先抽支烟就回去，好不好」？蒙尼卡道：「烟在我口袋裏」。約翰伸手去掏着烟，可是連一封電報一齊掏了出來。他喊道：「電報」（未完）</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary: Agricultural Relief After Drought and Flood Disasters. Respectfully, it is undeniable that our country's rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. Concentrating all efforts on relief is also a common consensus among informed individuals. The deepening economic panic in our country's rural areas is due to the impact of the global panic. In addition, since the beginning of spring this year, the provinces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have generally suffered from drought. Even in areas with considerable irrigation facilities, the harvest is estimated to be at most only 50-60%. There are many areas with no harvest at all, such as the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In the Yellow River basin, floods have caused disasters, and the harvest is also very meager. In short, the disaster situation in the south is very serious. Refugees in Qiupu, Anhui, have even resorted to eating from large households. Many farmers in Zhejiang have committed suicide due to lack of food and clothing. This phenomenon is truly a crisis for the entire nation. "The old and weak are abandoned in ditches, and the young and strong are scattered in all directions" has become a common sight everywhere. These poor people who are scattered in all directions generally have only two options. One is to join the army as soldiers, and the other is to flow into cities to work. Although joining the army cannot be said to be absolutely bad, it is not a proper solution when the whole country is suffering from an excess of redundant soldiers. Factories and other businesses in urban areas have recently not only been unable to absorb farmers leaving the countryside but have also had to eliminate them. Therefore, it is very difficult for farmers to find work in cities. Apart from this, they will become beggars and thieves. The danger involved is truly extraordinary. Recently, the government authorities have paid attention to this. They plan to reduce or exempt taxes in disaster areas to alleviate the burden on farmers. The financial sector has implemented lending to rural areas to ease the rural economy. At the same time, they are trying to redistribute the excessive cash accumulated in cities back to rural areas. This would naturally be very effective in peacetime if there were no disasters, no wars, and no economic aggression from the international community. However, with natural disasters rampant today, human-caused disasters unresolved, coupled with foreign dumping and monopolies, and the impending Far East war, the rural economy is facing enormous threats that the aforementioned methods cannot alleviate. When it comes to actively rescuing farmers, it is certainly impossible to fully describe it in this short article. I can only briefly mention one principle for the consideration of the Chinese people: we hope that we can find ways to provide farmers with an outlet in the industrial sector. At present, private capital operating private businesses and extracting profits is equivalent to scraping iron off a needle. Only using state capital to operate new methods that are being tested may be more effective. This is because publicly owned enterprises are not purely for profit but are based on public welfare. This has long been implemented effectively in advanced countries. Although our country's industry lags behind today, it is not difficult to benefit farmers if we can work together with the strength of a group. If the government (whether central or local) invests in establishing enterprises and entrusts people with operational knowledge and work experience to manage them, given a considerable period of time and fully utilizing scientific methods and the labor of unemployed farmers, it can be determined that it will be effective. Here are a few types of businesses that should be established. (1) Restore closed factories. As far as the closed factories are concerned, half of them are due to poor management, and half are due to poor market conditions. If the government lends capital to the factory owners and indicates the direction of operation without focusing on profitability, the future of the business will be promising. Otherwise, the government should entrust someone to operate it directly, treating the former factory owner as a shareholder and allowing them to participate in the work and adopt their past experience. It will not be difficult to restore the factories that have been shut down, and an outlet for farmers can also be opened at the same time. (2) Heavy industry and the chemical industry are very nascent in our country. To operate them on a large scale, group power must be used. Technical difficulties can be solved by scientific methods. (3) Develop the transportation industry. Most of our country's transportation industry is state-owned, but the bureaucratic habits of the personnel have always been too heavy, and the sense of responsibility too light. In the future, old habits should be eliminated to serve the convenience of farmers as much as possible. If the above three types of enterprises can be started immediately, on the one hand, a large number of farmers can be rescued, and on the other hand, a foundation can be laid for productive enterprises, opening a path for the country's long-term plan. Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Planning to Provide Loans to Farmers Pilot Project to be Implemented First in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces (Nanjing) The amount of savings in the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has increased year by year. The director of the bureau, Tang Baoshu, believes that using this savings exclusively for remittances and interest is too narrow in scope. It would be better to invest in industry and establish domestic farmer lending institutions to regulate the rural economy. The Ministry of Communications has approved an allocation of 5 million yuan in savings as a farmer lending fund. As all urban and rural postal remittances across the country are fully opened in the future, it will be increased at any time. However, the methods are quite complicated, such as farmers' living conditions, industrial and commercial conditions, the relationship between farmers and farmers' banks, the interest rates and procedures for lending, the average number of acres of farmland, and the burdens on poor farmers' families, etc. All must be investigated first. The former Deputy Director of the Postal District, Cheng Shifan, went to the Longhai, Jiaoji, Pinghan, Jinpu, Jinghu, and Huhangyong railway lines to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the postal districts in the mainland and various cities and towns, which are handled locally by the post office. The investigation has now been completed separately and submitted to the Ministry of Communications. After research, it was decided to first implement the lending fund in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. About 800,000 in Jiangsu and 500,000 in Zhejiang. The location of the loan office post office is generally established and divided into two parts: (1) Loan, (2) Remittance, pledge and transportation of agricultural products, so that farmers can borrow money at low interest rates and agricultural products can be circulated to various places. The staff of the loan institutions in each district are trained from the postal staff and dispatched at any time according to the size of the area. If there is a practical need, cooperate with the Farmers' Bank of the two provinces.

<p>Russia Issues Serious Statement to Puppet Regime Demanding Protection of the Chinese Eastern Railway Ineffective Protection Leads to Repeated Train Robberies Denies Destructive Acts by Russian Personnel (Moscow) According to a dispatch from Harbin, the Deputy Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Kushnizov, sent a letter to the Director and Board of Directors of the railway, who represent the "Manchu Government," stating that the troops protecting the Chinese Eastern Railway were turning a blind eye to the destruction of the railway by bandits. He had repeatedly written to the "Manchu Government" without effect. The troops have not fulfilled their main duty, which is to prevent bandits from entering the Chinese Eastern Railway area and to ensure the safety of the Chinese Eastern Railway employees. As a result of his letters, three armored trains prepared to protect the railway line have not been used. Therefore, the current unrest is not due to the military authorities' ineffectiveness in suppressing bandits. (Reuters dispatch, 26th) (Moscow) According to reports from Harbin, the Vice Chairman of the Chinese Eastern Railway Board of Directors, Kuznetsov, submitted a statement to the Chairman of the Board and Li Shaogeng, who also serves as the "Manchu Government" representative on the Board, reiterating the issue of railway protection with an extremely serious attitude. Kuznetsov pointed out that the protection of the railway is currently in an impossible situation. Despite repeated calls for attention, the Chairman of the Board deferred to the headquarters of the railway's guard force. Regardless of Kuznetsov's repeated applications to the Chairman of the Board, regardless of their joint letter to the headquarters of the guard force, the Board has not been able to obtain any solution. (The only result is the deployment of troops to protect passenger trains, but this is practically useless, because since the railway lost its protection, trains have been passing through in a state of chance. Unscrupulous individuals can easily stop traffic by damaging the tracks and killing train drivers, just as passengers are often robbed. The railway police are not performing their primary task, such as preventing bandits from entering the railway area and ensuring the safety of the railway workers and employees, so that they can prevent theft and looting by repairing the tracks. It is often ineffective to simply have railway police escort the trains. The situation is even worse for freight trains that lack guards. The Manchurian representatives of the Board are well aware of this situation. In the past and present, they have not found a way to enable the guards to fulfill their primary role. Kuznetsov further pointed out that there are three special armored trains patrolling the Chinese Eastern Railway for protection, and emphasized that, according to the report of the Director of the railway's Main Bureau, regardless of the systematic robberies of freight and passenger trains every day, the railway police headquarters is not using this to protect the railway. The headquarters' attitude towards suppressing bandits and preventing damage to the tracks fully demonstrates that it is not that the headquarters or the railway police are unable to overcome the bandits. Some Manchurian authorities are trying to blame the incidents occurring on the Chinese Eastern Railway on the Soviet railway workers and employees, accusing them of destructive acts and persecuting them unreasonably. Kuznetsov also stated, "I categorically deny such absurd accusations. They are bravely fulfilling their responsibilities, even at the risk of their lives. As the Chairman of the Board, you should know that the railway employees are struggling to work under extremely difficult conditions related to their lives. You should be more aware than anyone else that these accusations are completely meaningless. I have the right to expect you to take the necessary steps to petition the superior "Manchu Government" to stop these unreasonable and harmful accusations and persecutions against Soviet personnel, and to enable the railway police headquarters to effectively assume the responsibility of protecting the railway, so that the railway will not be damaged and traffic will be suspended. I hope you will inform me of the steps you have taken as soon as possible." The aforementioned statement was also accompanied by the Chinese Eastern Railway Board's resolution on the necessary methods for protecting the railway, and the railway police headquarters' letter on canceling the escort of freight trains (submitted to the Board), and the Board's letter to the Chairman of the Board (regarding the restoration of the protection of freight trains), and other documents. (TASS dispatch, 26th) (Moscow) The newspapers here today published the full text of the official documents of the Japanese Foreign Minister on August 21st and the "Manchu Government" on August 22nd regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway Conference. This agency is instructed to publish the following statement: "The official documents published by the Japanese and Manchu sides repeatedly repeat the figures published by this agency on August 18th. However, both official documents interpret the facts and figures in a one-sided manner, attempting to prove that only the Japanese and Manchu sides maintained a humble attitude during the conference. For example, the "Manchu Government" official document attempts to make the public believe that they are willing to pay 170 million instead of 120 million for the Chinese Eastern Railway. However, the aforementioned figure includes 50 million in compensation fees, which they must pay to dismiss the Soviet and Manchu employees of the railway. After the railway is sold, whether or not the railway employees are dismissed clearly depends entirely on the new owners in the future, that is, the Japanese and Manchu sides. They must bear the compensation costs upon dismissal. Therefore, this cost clearly cannot be included in the selling price of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The other more sophistical and fictitious arguments presented in the official documents of both the Japanese and Manchu sides are aimed at justifying their one-sided views. This agency does not need to argue about them." (TASS dispatch, 27th) Seventy Railway Employees Arrested More than Forty are Russians, The Rest Chinese Said to be Charged with Destroying Trains (Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received an official notification from the "Manchu Government" stating that "Manchu" police plan to limit the number of people arrested in connection with the train destruction case in the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway to a minimum. The Chinese Eastern Railway employees who have already been arrested will be prosecuted for the crime of destroying trains. Today, newspaper reports state that more than seventy Chinese Eastern Railway employees have been arrested, of whom about forty are Russians, and the rest are Chinese. In other news, the Soviet Russian government has now recalled the administrative personnel of the Chinese Eastern Railway, apparently deciding to replace them in order to ease the situation. At the same time, the headquarters of the railway guard force in Harbin issued an article refuting the Soviet Russian authorities' accusation that the railway guard force had neglected its duties, stating that the three semi-armored trains provided by the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau, stationed at Mianpo, Hengdaohezi, and Xiaochengzi stations, are very busy using them to guide trains or attack bandits, and that one train derailed and was damaged on August 23rd while suppressing bandits between Mianpo and Acheng. (Reuters dispatch, 27th) Tensions Rise Between Russia and the Puppet Regime Red Army Holds Border Drills to Show Strength Rumors Abound, People Panic (Tianjin) Starting from the 22nd, twelve Russian fighter planes from the Chita airfield have flown to the Abagaitu Russian airfield on the Manchurian border and are stationed there. They fly along the border every morning, practicing tactics, causing panic between Manchuria Station and Hailar, and rumors are rife. Since the 19th, the negotiations between the Japanese puppet regime and the Soviet Union on the Chinese Eastern Railway have broken down. The puppet Songhua River warships have all been ordered to stop sailing on the Heilongjiang and Ussuri River routes. The puppet Northeast United Aviation Bureau's passenger and cargo ships only sail to Fujin. Fujin, Gaojiatun, and Tongjiang are all defended by the puppet Jilin-Heilongjiang River defense gunboats. The atmosphere on the river is tense. The Soviet Union is building fortresses on the delta where the Ussuri and Tumen Rivers converge, laying electrical grids, and stationing a large detachment of Red Guards, posing a threat to navigation on the Ussuri River and to the puppet Fuyuan County. Fuyuan County was extremely desolate, with only thirty shops and no more than five hundred households. Recently, due to war rumors, everyone has moved elsewhere, causing the city to be deserted, like a dead fortress. (Special dispatch, 27th) (Tianjin) At 7:00 AM on the 23rd, three Soviet planes were spotted over Manzhouli, forming a squadron and flying from Abagaitu Da Wuli, practicing at high altitude over Manzhouli Station and the Zhalannuoer area for twenty minutes, and dropping leaflets, telling the puppet country to stop hindering the Chinese Eastern Railway's traffic order and arresting Soviet railway employees, and saying that the Soviet people have reached the point of unbearable endurance, and not to provoke a fire. The arrested railway employees must be released immediately. On the 22nd, a train of troops suddenly arrived at Da Wuli, a Russian border outpost outside Manzhouli, carrying about a brigade of Soviet Red Guards. On the morning of the 23rd, two more trains arrived, carrying cavalry, infantry, and a lot of artillery. (Special dispatch, 27th) Content of the Russian-Puppet Waterway Agreement (Changchun) The Russian "Manchu" waterway conference has been in preliminary negotiations since June 28th. After a tortuous process and more than sixty meetings, the two countries' opinions have converged, and the long-standing issue has been resolved. The formal signing will take place in early September. This issue was established in 1923, stipulating that the "Manchu State" would pay the expenses and the Russian side would carry out the work. The content of the new waterway agreement established between Russia and "Manchu" is as follows: Russia and "Manchu" have established the following agreement to ensure the safety of the border rivers: (1) Abolish the waterway agreement of 1923. (2) Russia and "Manchu" will establish a coordinated technical committee to implement the waterway agreement. (3) The committee will supervise waterway surveys, establish water markers, and plan dredging, and determine the budget used for the work. (4) The expenses required for the work will be shared equally by the two countries. (5) The committee will be organized by an equal number of members from both countries. (6) The navigation markers within the territory of the country will be implemented separately by the country. (The following is omitted) (United News of Japan dispatch, 27th) Siamese King Tours Europe Arrives in Paris via Geneva (Geneva) The King and Queen of Siam are touring Europe, and their interest is still high. This afternoon, the King and Queen arrived here from Lausanne City and will depart for Paris in the evening. (Havas dispatch, 26th) Hitler's Speech Appeasement Policy Towards Saar Calls for Understanding with France Opponents Hold Counter-Demonstration (Koblenz) Chancellor Hitler opened the Saar plebiscite propaganda rally at Ehrenbreitstein Fortress today. In his speech, he vigorously appealed for understanding with France. Countless people came here today, with more than 200 special trains coming from all over Germany. When Hitler delivered his speech to the sound system, there were about 450,000 listeners, of which 100,000 were residents of the Saar region. One of the main points of Hitler's speech was to appeal for the elimination of the old hatred between France and Germany. Hitler said that the two countries are now laying the foundation for peace. Regarding the territorial issue, only the Saar region has not been resolved, but it does not have to become a hereditary feud because of this. If someone voluntarily remains German, then Germany should regard them as returning prodigal sons and express their welcome. (National Electric dispatch, 26th) (Saarbrücken) The Socialist Party, the Communist Party, Catholics, and those who agree with the current situation in the Saar region jointly held a demonstration movement in the Sulzbach district today to confront the one held by Hitler at the Ehrenbreitstein battery. A total of 80,000 people participated, and they unanimously swore, "The Saar will never belong to Hitler, and we will never allow the brown plague to invade our territory." Two National Socialist Party members threw gas bombs at the crowd and were arrested on the spot. (Reuters dispatch, 26th) Hitler's Speech Saar Returns to Germany Movement Makes Saar People and Germans Closer Resolves the Only Problem Between Germany and France (Koblenz) German Chancellor Adolf Hitler started the movement for the return of Saar because the Saar referendum will be held on January 15, 1935, and he called the people who oppose the National Socialist Party in Saar not worth calling Germans and directly comparable to Jews. Hitler's speech was broadcast by Koblenz across from the Ehrenbreitstein ancient battery to Saar and various parts of Germany, and hundreds of thousands of people listened. Hitler said that although there are Jews, Christianity can still spread, so even with the opposition elements of Saar, the movement of the National Socialist Party will still be victorious. Assuming that the world outside Germany attacks us, the reason is that we protect the interests of the people. International conspirators use all kinds of tricks to harm us. Those who dare to complain to us say that nothing can force us to lower our heads. We will never surrender no matter what. The more difficult we are, the more united we are. The survival of the German people in the next few thousand years will be like their survival in the past. Hitler also addressed the Saar people, saying that when the time comes, they will be welcomed back to the motherland. Germany's policy on Saar is based on harmony and does not investigate which party it belonged to before, and seeks to consolidate the economic foundation of Saar. This will make the Saar people more closely integrated with Germany. The Saar issue is now the only outstanding issue between Germany and France. He hopes that once the issue is resolved, a sincere peace can be established with France. When Hitler arrived at the Ehrenbreitstein battery from Krolle with Propaganda Minister Goebbels on a motorboat this afternoon, he was greatly welcomed by the National Socialist Party members. Two hundred special trains have been running back and forth for days, carrying demonstrators to Koblenz, and the whole town is decorated with flags and colored ribbons, reaching a peak. (Reuters, 26th) (Koblenz) There was a very large demonstration in the Saar region tonight at the Ehrenbreitstein fortress for returning to Germany. Hitler personally attended the event and gave a speech to 500,000 Germans and Saar residents. About 130,000 Saar men, women, and children all sailed to the site to listen quietly to Hitler's speech. Representatives of groups from all over Germany came to participate in this movement, all traveling thousands of miles by train. Hitler's speech briefly stated, "The fundamental foreign policy of Germany can be reiterated, which is to maintain peace, and to have the guarantee of equal status, and the establishment of national freedom and honor. If a part of the world thinks that we can be made to give up this claim, they do not really know us. If pressure is applied to us, then we can automatically stand up economically and make them understand that pressure is not reliable. We should also state clearly that there is no separation between the National Socialist Party and Christianity, and the only separation is that religion is a matter above the land, and politics is a matter closely related to the land. Germany has never attacked freedom of belief. The decision on the date of the Saar region's referendum can not only reassure the 800,000 Saar people, but also delight the 67 million people in Germany, because the German people are always worried about their Saar compatriots living in the confines of foreigners. Today, the Saar people have clearly expressed their unity, which can serve as an example for the German people in the future. This kind of unity transcends all political factions and economic aggression, and can overcome everything. When the Saar people return one day, we will regard them as one of us and warmly welcome them. On the day of the Saar region's restoration, we still have two things to do. One is to reconcile without considering the previous political factions, and the other is to rescue the economic wounds. Furthermore, the Saar issue is the last territorial dispute between Germany and France. After this matter is resolved, there will be no other important issues between the two countries. The work we are doing today is extremely difficult and important. We should help each other and cooperate to hope for success. If a few heartless agitators in the international community, whom we know very well but do not want to specify which country they belong to, still want to engage in inciting the two great nations to become eternal enemies, I only have deep faith that human reason and calm common sense will not be deceived by them," he said. (National Electric dispatch, 26th) French Public Opinion Still Full of Doubts States That France is Also Willing to Cooperate with Germany But Cannot Interfere with the Saar Issue (Paris) French newspapers commented on German Chancellor Hitler's speech yesterday, saying that Hitler was full of peace and understanding, and his words were extremely pleasant, but whether he could make the Saar people believe that "they can live safely in Germany" is not certain. The newspapers believe that if Hitler's lies have the nature of binding the future, they will be happy to record them. However, Le Jour said, "Treaties have become waste paper, what use are declarations?" Le Matin stated, "Hitler is threatened by three dangers: (1) the suspicion of the Catholic Party; (2) the unease of the various political parties; (3) Germany once focused on the interests of the Ruhr region and sacrificed the Saar. Although this period has passed, the memory is still there. Now Hitler promises to consider the prosperity of the Saar region, and he has already felt that this threat cannot be ignored," and so on. L'Écho de Paris gave a response to the part of the speech that mentioned France, saying, "France is not an enemy of Germany. The most precious wish of the French nation is the Franco-German cooperation that Hitler mentioned. But the Saar belongs to the Saar people, and only the local people can handle the Saar system, which is not something that France can interfere with," and so on. Yesterday, during the demonstration in Koblenz, Germany, 70,000 people in the Saar region also gathered in Sulzbach to demonstrate in support of maintaining the status quo of the Saar. If we want to judge the meaning of yesterday, the demonstration in Sulzbach must also be taken into account. As Le Figaro said, "The demonstration movement in Sulzbach was not encouraged by anyone, nor was it subsidized by anyone, but there were as many as 70,000 people who asked for freedom at the same time. These people are all expressing their opposition to Hitler," and so on.

During this period, it has issued the New Cabinet's Ten-Point Program and issued instructions in the name of Prime Minister Okada on purifying official discipline. It has spent 3 million yuan in temporary funds to alleviate the poverty of rural villages and implement relief policies. Now, as the new autumn political season arrives, the government has decided to implement the Ten-Point Program, including diplomatic issues such as abandoning the Washington Treaty, countermeasures for the disarmament conference, and not reforming the institutions stationed in Manchuria. Domestic issues include permanent countermeasures for rural villages, preparing next year's budget, establishing a national policy deliberation council, and convening a provisional parliamentary session. The government atmosphere is quite tense. (United News of Japan dispatch, 27th) (Tokyo) The three original proposals of the Army, Foreign Affairs, and Colonial Affairs Ministries regarding the reform of the institutions in Manchuria have been submitted to the hand of Cabinet Secretary Kawada. At present, the administrative authorities of the Army and Foreign Affairs Ministries are conducting direct negotiations. The Army and Foreign Affairs proposals disagree on the command system of the plenipotentiary ambassador. The Army proposal advocates establishing a special official system for the plenipotentiary ambassador, placing it under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs advocates that the plenipotentiary ambassador should be placed under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Foreign Affairs in accordance with international law and opposes establishing a special official system for diplomatic institutions. Because the two ministries are fundamentally different, the Colonial Affairs proposal also has disagreements with the Army and Foreign Affairs proposals regarding the attribution of the powers of the Kwantung Governor-General. Therefore, it is quite difficult for the three ministries of the Army, Foreign Affairs, and Colonial Affairs to reach a compromise. It is generally said that this reform proposal will be destroyed in the same way as the previous Manchurian Railway reorganization proposal. In Dalian, there is already a movement among the Kwantung Office and the citizens to support the Colonial Affairs proposal. Therefore, if the matter is delayed, the problem will become more difficult. Prime Minister Okada and Cabinet Secretary Kawada hope to reach a compromise before the face-saving problem of each ministry develops. Cabinet Secretary Kawada and Director-General Kanamori of the Legislation Bureau have repeatedly studied the proposals of the three ministries. The government does not want to automatically draft a compromise proposal and support it, but will always mediate the direct negotiations between the three ministries and require mutual concessions from each ministry. However, the reform proposal needs to consult with the Privy Council, so it is carefully studied to make it easier to pass. In addition, the official system of the Kwantung Office will be changed, and the special accounting must also be changed, so the Director of Accounting of the Ministry of Finance, Kaya, was informed of the proposals of the various ministries and ordered to study the budget-related matters.

Until the end of the year, it will try to avoid experimental actions. There are two reasons why the government wants to continue its conservative policy. First, the government wants to promote its credit, because it needs huge sums of money to distribute various expenses in the middle of next month and at the end of the year. Second, the president and his advisors want to avoid speculation in the recovery plan, and if an expansion policy is implemented, the speculation boom of last summer will rise again.

<p>(Mayor's Report)</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, "Comrades, gentlemen, Confucius is a teacher for all generations and the master of Chinese scholarship who carries on the past and opens up the future. Ancient Chinese culture was promoted and developed by Confucius. Therefore, our nation's four thousand years of glorious and great culture can all be attributed to Confucius. Confucius' personality, his doctrines, and his spirit have governed Chinese society for over two thousand years. The late Premier taught us that to build our nation and to seek strength, we must first restore the inherent status of the nation. To restore the inherent status of the nation, we must first restore the inherent culture, morality, and spirit of the nation. To restore the inherent culture, morality, and spirit of the nation, we cannot but honor Confucius. The ceremony of honoring Confucius has been practiced for a long time, but the significance of honoring Confucius today is different from before. Throughout history, Chinese emperors have all superficially honored Confucius, offering sacrifices in both spring and autumn each year. Our investigation into the origins of imperial veneration of Confucius reveals that it began during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, about three hundred years after Confucius' death. Emperor Wu of Han honored Confucius because he recognized the complexity of the various schools of thought at that time and believed that they were detrimental to the state and the nation. Therefore, he dismissed the other schools and exclusively honored Confucianism. The honoring of Confucius by Chinese emperors throughout history originated from this point. However, it was not for the sake of the nation and the people. The emperors of the past emphasized Confucius's doctrine of loyalty to the ruler, using a part of Confucius's doctrine of loyalty to the ruler to deceive the people in order to consolidate their imperial lineage for generations to come. Therefore, the emperors' honoring of Confucius was merely a means of deceiving the people and had nothing to do with the nation and the people. It completely lost the significance of honoring Confucius. The general public believed that Confucius belonged to the scholars and that honoring and sacrificing to Confucius was a matter for the scholars and not for ordinary people who did not read. Therefore, the ritual of sacrificing to Confucius at that time was equivalent to a ceremony of worshiping gods and idols. The significance of honoring Confucius was thus completely lost. Confucius's doctrines are based on the teachings of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou, emphasizing 'benevolence,' 'saving the people,' 'revolution,' and 'abdication,' which are the so-called 'comforting the people and punishing the guilty,' and 'obeying Heaven and responding to the people.' Confucius's doctrines can be divided into two parts: one part is ethical, and the other part is political. The ethical part of Confucius's doctrines tells us how to be a person. In general, it is the way of loyalty, reciprocity, and measured consideration. As Zeng Zi said, 'The Way of our Master is simply loyalty and reciprocity.' Broadly speaking, it includes the affection between father and son, the righteousness between ruler and subject, the distinction between husband and wife, the order between elders and juniors, and the trustworthiness between friends, as well as filial piety, fraternal love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. The political part of Confucius's doctrines tells us how to do things, which is Confucius's consistent political philosophy, from the investigation of things, the extension of knowledge, the sincerity of intention, the rectification of the heart, and the cultivation of the person to the regulation of the family, the governance of the state, and the pacification of the world, starting from an individual's heart and extending to governing the state and pacifying the world, from the inside to the outside. Our late Premier highly valued Confucius's political philosophy, praising Confucius as the greatest political scholar of ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, and extolling Confucius's doctrines as systematic and consistent. However, although Confucius's doctrines have governed Chinese society for more than two thousand years, what has penetrated the hearts of the general public can be said to be only the ethical part. As for the political part, only scholars knew about it; non-scholars did not know. It was not popularized. Moreover, what the scholars knew was only superficial. Therefore, the purpose of scholars reading books in the past was only to become officials. They read Confucius's books because they wanted to become officials, but they did not understand Confucius's principles. They only remembered the chapters and sentences in Confucius's books. Even if they knew Confucius's principles, most of them could not put them into practice. The reason for this is that, from the late Spring and Autumn period to the time of Emperor Wu of Han, the emergence of various schools of thought had a great impact on Confucius's doctrines, especially the doctrines of Yang Zhu, Mozi, and Huang-Lao. During the Qin Dynasty's burning of books and burying of scholars, the Way of Confucius was almost extinguished. Later, during the Han Confucian revival, although Confucius's classics were reorganized, emphasis was placed on textual annotations and interpretations, neglecting the spirit of practice. During the Song Dynasty, although the significance of Confucius's doctrines was elaborated, schools and factions arose, and discussions became divergent, focusing on theory rather than practice. As the saying goes, 'Before the Song scholars finished their discussions, the Jin troops had already crossed the river.' From this, we can imagine how decadent the academic atmosphere was at that time. From the Tang Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, scholars were constrained by the imperial examination system, using 'high-sounding essays and fixed formats as stepping stones.' Therefore, scholars at that time read books for the sake of examinations, and examinations for the sake of becoming officials, completely unaware of 'what the purpose of reading the books of sages and worthies was' and even more unaware of the responsibilities that scholars should bear to society and the nation. The true meaning of Confucianism was thus completely lost. Therefore, our commemoration of Confucius here today is different from the past. The Nationalist Party follows the Three Principles of the People. The Three Principles of the People are the crystallization of the late Premier's revolutionary thought. The late Premier's revolutionary thought was certainly inspired by modern science, but it was also nurtured by China's inherent culture. We can see much of the late Premier's emphasis on Confucius's doctrines in his teachings. We can say that Confucius was a compilation of ancient achievements, and the late Premier was a compilation of ancient and modern achievements, both in China and abroad. Therefore, to complete the Chinese National Revolution, we must implement the Three Principles of the People. To implement the Three Principles of the People, we must promote China's inherent culture. To promote China's inherent culture, we must honor Confucius. Today's honoring of Confucius is not a restoration of the past, nor is it idol worship. Today's honoring of Confucius is for the sake of the nation's revival. Therefore, the Nationalist Party designated August 27th as Confucius's birthday commemoration, which has the same significance as commemorating the late Premier's birthday. To commemorate Confucius, we must enable the people of the whole country to have a deep understanding of Confucius's doctrines. At the same time, we must also understand the consistent relationship between Confucius's doctrines and the late Premier's doctrines. After recognizing this relationship, we must put it into practice, implement the Three Principles of the People, and, with the spirit of loving things and loving people, complete the National Revolution, and strive for the revival of the nation, so as to advance the world toward universal harmony. Only in this way can we say that we are commemorating and honoring Confucius."</p>
<p>(Tong Xingbai's Speech)</p>
<p>Briefly stated, the first reason to commemorate Confucius is because Confucius had a positive and upward striving spirit, which is worthy of our emulation. The era and environment in which Confucius lived were characterized by constant wars between states, social disorder, and human suffering. Therefore, those who were concerned about the situation were either dissatisfied with the government or with society, leading to a tendency of misanthropy. There are many examples of this tendency in ancient books. There was also a faction of escapists who despised the state and society and had thoughts of leaving the world. There was also a faction of opportunists who indulged in extreme hedonism and debauchery. Therefore, people at that time were either misanthropic, escapist, or opportunistic. Only Confucius was able to take responsibility, act independently, and actively correct the chaotic era and environment. This spirit can not only save society at that time but can also save modern society. Since the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, people have been running around calling for national salvation. Later, believing that the country's affairs were beyond remedy, they turned to a path of passive enjoyment. Shanghai's industry and commerce are declining day by day, while the entertainment industry is booming. This abnormal phenomenon is enough to prove the depravity of people's hearts. Therefore, today's commemoration of Confucius should emulate Confucius's active spirit. Second, every nation in the world has always commemorated the glorious and splendid achievements of the state. Great figures in Chinese history, such as Confucius, are even more worthy of commemoration. Therefore, commemorating Confucius shows that we are not ungrateful to our ancestors. Third, Confucius's doctrines encompass a wide range of subjects, but the central point of all his doctrines is the rectification of names. In terms of people, it is to rectify oneself and others. In terms of national laws and regulations, it is to rectify names in order to rectify all things. Therefore, Confucius wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals, and rebellious ministers and traitorous sons were afraid. The center of his doctrines coincides with the late Premier's principles. Therefore, our commemoration of Confucius is, on the one hand, to complete the Three Principles of the People, and, on the other hand, to emulate Confucius's active and striving spirit, so as to be a model for later generations. Mayor Wu's report and photo (taken by Qichang). Shanghai's all circles held a memorial meeting for Confucius' birthday (photographed by Ye Changlie).</p>
<p>(Pan Gongzhan's Speech)</p>
<p>Briefly stated, I have already written an article on the educational part of Confucius's doctrines, which was published in the Morning Post, so I will not repeat it here. Now, I would like to specifically raise three points. First, the commemoration of Confucius's birthday must commemorate Confucius's national spirit. Confucius's national spirit can be seen everywhere in his doctrines and writings. For example, during the Spring and Autumn period, the state of Qi, with the use of Guan Zhong, was able to unite the feudal lords nine times and rectify the world. Guan Zhong was indeed a great statesman at that time, but Confucius criticized him, saying, "If Guan Zhong knows propriety, then who does not know propriety?" But in one aspect, Confucius greatly praised Guan Zhong, saying that he was "capable of benevolence" because, without Guan Zhong's rectification of the world, the people would have been reduced to slaves of foreign countries. From this, we can know that Confucius's spirit is "expelling the barbarians." Expelling the barbarians is the crystallization of Confucius's doctrines, which is also the late Premier's nationalism. Expelling the barbarians can also be interpreted as revenge. Therefore, today's commemoration of Confucius should have the spirit of revenge. Second, Confucius's life can be said to have been unsuccessful, but there was a period when he managed the politics of the state of Lu for three months, during which lost items were not picked up and doors were not closed at night. The reason for this was that he used pure moral influence without punishment, but when moral influence was ineffective, he would kill without pardon, such as the so-called Shao Zhengmao, a well-known person in Lu at that time, who was resolutely killed. Today, China is beset by both internal and external troubles. In dealing with foreign affairs, we should adopt Confucius's national spirit. In dealing with domestic affairs, we should adopt Confucius's spirit of clear rewards and punishments. Japan's strength lies in its ability to respect the imperial family and expel the barbarians, but respecting the imperial family and expelling the barbarians are only a small part of Confucius's doctrines, and yet Japan has become a strong country. On this first commemoration of Confucius's birthday, I hope that all compatriots across the country will work together to develop the treasures of Confucius's doctrines, achieve great unification, be able to seek revenge, use the spirit of revolution to stop internal strife, so as to achieve the goal of domestic tranquility and foreign resistance.</p>

The area around Wenmiao Road was under particularly strict security to prevent petty criminals from stirring up trouble.</p>

<p>Baron Johnson's party of eight arrived in Shanghai aboard the French postal ship Aramis, which docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Pier at 7:00 AM yesterday. The Belgian Consul General in Shanghai, Tan Erfu, Consul Hu Yiye, Consul Dai Erhei, Vice Consul Bart, and over ten Belgian expatriates went to the pier to greet them. Since the Special Envoy's arrival in Shanghai yesterday was still an unofficial visit to China, the various Chinese agencies had pre-arranged with the Belgian Consul not to attend the welcome. Accompanying the Special Envoy, in addition to his wife, were Counselor and Mrs. Adou, Secretary and Mrs. Ersimen, Military Attaché Colonel Mondlan, and his son Anwili Johnson, a total of eight people, all staying at the Cathay Hotel.</p>
<p>(Banquet by the Belgian Consul)</p>
<p>Tan Erfu, the Counselor of the Belgian Embassy and Consul General in Shanghai, hosted a banquet at the French Club on Huanlong Road in the French Concession at 7:00 PM last night to welcome the Special Envoy and his entourage. The Special Envoy and his party are scheduled to leave Shanghai at 4:00 PM today by train to Xuzhou, and then travel via the Longhai Railway to visit Kaifeng, Luoyang, and Longmen, before taking the Pinghan Railway to Beijing.</p>
<p>(Mission to China)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Belgian Consulate issued a statement declaring that Special Envoy Johnson's visit was solely for the purpose of meeting with Chairman Lin to announce the succession of King Leopold III of Belgium. However, his arrival in Shanghai yesterday was still an unofficial visit to China, and his official activities would begin on September 1st when he returns from Beijing. The envoy is scheduled to formally meet with Chairman Lin on the morning of September 8th, and will receive official receptions in Nanjing on the 8th and 9th. On the morning of the 10th, he will return to Shanghai and attend a reception hosted by Mayor Wu, before departing for Europe on the morning of the 11th aboard the Italian ship Conte Verde.</p>
<p>(Brief Biography of the Envoy)</p>
<p>According to the Consulate's published biography of the Special Envoy, Mr. Johnson is a prominent figure in Belgium, serving as the Chairman of the Belgian Bankers Association and managing over twenty well-known Belgian banks and industrial firms, holding significant authority in the financial and industrial sectors. It is reported that the Special Envoy's visit to China will also include an inspection of China's industrial and commercial sectors for future reference in promoting Sino-Belgian trade.</p>

<p>Yesterday Morning, It Was Cloudy and Rainless</p>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, the sun has been blazing like fire, and the weather has been stiflingly hot. Residents have been both annoyed by the intense heat and saddened by the withering of the crops. Yesterday morning, although the city was covered with dense clouds and the air pressure dropped sharply, many hoped for a downpour to save the withering crops. However, by 11:00 AM, the clouds gradually thinned, followed by clear skies and the reappearance of the scorching sun, much to the disappointment of the people.</p>
<p>Autumn Tides are High at the Mouth of the Song River</p>
<p>It is now the autumn flood season, and the tides at the mouth of the Song River are rising daily. In the past two days, it has been high tide, so the sea tide rose dramatically, differing only two or three feet from the Outer Bund of Wusong. Low-lying areas around Yizhoutang are at the same level as the river. Fortunately, there was no hurricane, so the water was still calm. However, the predicted great flood on the 3rd of the eighth lunar month is imminent, so the seawall in Baoshan is being repaired rapidly and can be completed ahead of schedule. The Outer Bund of Wusong in the city was destroyed by the Japanese army during the January 28th Incident, leaving many gaps, and further erosion by the tides over the past two years has made it even more dangerous. It is reported that the Municipal Public Works Bureau has formally invited bids for repairs, but there is no definite date for the start of construction.</p>
<p>Zhang Gongquan Went to Lushan</p>
<p>According to Shin Shi News, Zhang Gongquan, General Manager of the Bank of China, took a boat from Shanghai two weeks ago to travel north to North China, Qingdao, Tianjin and other places to investigate the economic and rural conditions. At the same time, he also consulted with the financial community in North China, and consulted with Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, and others on various issues related to loans for the Pinghan Railway. After completing his trip in North China, Zhang took a train south from Tianjin on the 23rd of this month. When passing through Nanjing, he immediately stopped his return to Shanghai and transferred to a boat to Lushan. According to news from the head office of the Bank of China yesterday, Zhang will stay in Jiangxi for about two or three days before he can set off to return to Shanghai. According to reporters' inquiries with relevant parties, Zhang's trip will discuss the current financial situation in China and the financial problems in North China.</p>
<p>(Bei Songsun Returned to Shanghai Yesterday)</p>
<p>Bei Songsun, manager of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, flew to Jiangxi last week with Chen Hang and Song Ziliang because of the serious issue of the US raising silver prices to discuss countermeasures. After completing the matter, he went to Hankou from Jiangxi to inspect the local branch, and has already returned to Shanghai the day before. Yesterday, he went to the bank to work as usual. As for the rumors that Finance Minister Kong will organize a committee with representatives from the silver industry to formulate measures to control silver to remedy the silver price crisis, according to Shin Shi reporters' inquiries with relevant parties yesterday, it was said that the government has many ways to deal with the silver tide, but they are all still under study. The so-called organizing a committee and formulating control measures have not yet been heard of.</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo Answers Questions from Reporters</p>
<p>Shanghai Factory Inspection Issues</p>
<p>Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo Answers Questions from Reporters: (1) Li Pingheng of the Shanghai Factory Inspection visited the authorities of Britain and France today and has obtained considerable channels. The burning of the Shanghai Taiyi Malt Essence Factory makes factory inspection even more urgent. The Ministry has ordered the Labor Department to carry it out and consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Government to handle it together. However, the dispute regarding the handling of the inspection will have to be postponed until October before it can be resolved, because the British and French governments have instructed their ambassadors to China to re-instruct their consuls in Shanghai, who will arrive at that time.</p>
<p>Zeng Yangfu Returned to Hangzhou Yesterday</p>
<p>Collateral for the Loan Has Been Negotiated</p>
<p>According to the World News Agency, Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province, decided to issue 20 million yuan of local bonds to provide disaster relief due to the severe drought in the province and the exhaustion of the provincial treasury. He personally went to Nanjing to make a statement to the Central Government, and the Executive Yuan approved the issuance. Zeng and President Wang and others took the same train from Nanjing to Shanghai on the morning of the 25th to contact the banking community in Shanghai about the mortgage. The result was quite satisfactory, but the banking community considered the amount of this bond to be too large and still needs to be discussed by the industry and distributed for undertaking, so the mortgage procedures and methods have not yet been specifically resolved. Zeng has now returned to Hangzhou by train at noon yesterday because there are important government affairs in Zhejiang Province waiting to be dealt with. As for the mortgage method of the bond, it will have to wait until the banking community drafts a reply to Zeng before Zeng comes to Shanghai to complete the signing procedures.</p>
<p>Law Association Attends the National Coordination Conference</p>
<p>Representatives Leave for Guangzhou This Morning</p>
<p>Return to Shanghai on September 8th</p>
<p>The Sixth National Lawyers Association Congress is scheduled to open in Guangzhou on September 1st. The Shanghai Lawyers Association had previously selected Wu Zhengque, Wang Weizhen, and Chen Zhigao as representatives to attend. Later, Shen Junru and Yan Yinwu were added as supplementary members. Because Chen and Yan are standing committee members of the Association and need to arrive early to assist in the preparations, they left on the 26th. The other four members, Wu, Wang, Chen, and Shen, are scheduled to travel to Hong Kong this morning on the President Coolidge and then to Guangzhou. They are scheduled to return to Shanghai on the original ship on September 8th. Also traveling to Guangzhou on the same ship are Liu Liumin, representative from Jiangning, and Zhang Shiyan, representative from Wuxian.</p>
<p>British Professor Wihart Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Chinese-language newspaper Zi Lin Bao, Dr. Wihart, Professor of Agricultural Statistics at Cambridge University in England, arrived in China aboard the Asia Queen postal ship at the invitation of Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, today (the 27th). After a short stay, he will enter Nanjing and stay for four months, lecturing on agriculture and the mathematical research of experimental work. The directors of various agricultural experiment stations will gather in Nanjing in advance to listen to the lectures to broaden their experience and discuss all agricultural issues with the doctor. The doctor is forty-six years old and was originally a mathematician. He has special experience in applying mathematics to agricultural statistics. Since 1925, the world has relied on the doctor's efforts to apply mathematics to agricultural experiments. His most important contribution is the implementation of various agricultural experiment methods. The doctor has written many works on this specialty. China is a country based on agriculture, and its future depends on developing its agriculture using scientific methods. Chinese farmers have many strengths, but they have not been able to use science to increase their production, which is a pity. The doctor's trip will be of great benefit to Chinese agriculture.</p>
<p>Cultivating Agricultural Cooperation Talents</p>
<p>Two British and American Experts Arrived in Shanghai One After Another</p>
<p>British Credit Cooperation Expert Strickland</p>
<p>American Marketing Cooperation Expert Stephen</p>
<p>Nanjing Jinling University and the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, in order to cultivate agricultural cooperation talents and develop rural economic undertakings, have established the Agricultural Cooperation Lectureship at Jinling University with a donation from the Shanghai Bank, totaling 60,000 yuan. This fund is designated for hiring one British and one American expert in agricultural marketing cooperation and credit cooperation, who will teach and conduct surveys, research, and design of national rural cooperation undertakings to improve them. It is learned that the school has hired Mr. Strickland, a British credit cooperation expert, and Dr. Stephen, an American marketing cooperation expert. Strickland arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 25th aboard the Manbya, and Dr. Stephen arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the Empress of Russia. Both were received by the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank and stayed at the Cathay Hotel. Chen Guangfu, General Manager of the bank, hosted a banquet at a villa in West Shanghai last night to welcome them. Those who attended the banquet included Dr. Weissder, who had just arrived in China from England, and Xie Jiasheng, Dean of the Jin Ta Nong College. The biographies of the two gentlemen are recorded below.</p>

<p>Guangji Ship of China Merchants Bureau Suspended</p>
<p>Old Age and Unsuitable for Navigation</p>
<p>Ordered by the Ministry of Communications to Comply</p>
<p>The Guangji ship of the state-run China Merchants Bureau was submitted to the Ministry of Communications for consideration of being donated to the Wusong Merchant Marine School because the ship was old and dilapidated, and the school's repair costs would be reduced. Later, the Ministry of Communications sent technician Zhu Tianbing to Shanghai to inspect the bureau. According to the inspection results, the ship is 47 years old, the hull is made of steel, and the use of coal and speed are qualified, but the water line of the hull is heavily rusted. The loss has reached its limit, and the waterproof bulkheads are not very strong. The upper end of the rear bulkhead is leaking water due to excessive rust, all the boards on the ship are incomplete, the deck in the rear of the front cabin is leaking water, and the keel of the ship is heavily worn. The edge keels were mostly patched before. The main engine is old, and the moving friction parts and the bottom feet are slightly loose. The boiler is still complete. There are many patched places in the coal bunker, and the iron plates are very thin and will not be able to bear the heavy load. In short, except for the boiler, the entire ship is old and dilapidated and unsuitable for continued navigation. After the Ministry of Communications reported the situation, it was determined that the ship was showing a widespread state of age and destruction, and the safety of life at sea was at stake. It should be suspended as soon as possible. Yesterday, the Ministry specially ordered the bureau to comply with the suspension.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Plans to Build Salt Warehouses on All Sides</p>
<p>Borrowed a Huge Sum from Shanghai Banks</p>
<p>China and Other Banks Have Sent Personnel to Bengbu to Negotiate</p>
<p>According to New Sound News Agency, in order to build salt warehouses on all sides and provide relief for the livelihoods of workers at Twelve Wharfs, the Ministry of Finance borrowed money from banks such as China Bank. The banks decided to organize a banking syndicate to handle it and have sent representatives to Bengbu to negotiate with the Transport Envoy. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Proceeding with the Loan)</p>
<p>After the Salt Affairs Office canceled the sail transport at Twelve Wharfs and switched to using steamships to reach the four sides directly, the location and detailed plan for the salt warehouses were formulated by Transport Envoy Miao. The salt warehouses on four sides are: (1) Three locations on the Xiang River: Yuezhou, Changsha, Hengyang, (2) Two locations on the Hubei River: Hankou, Xindi, (3) Two locations on the West River: Jiujiang, Hukou, (4) Two locations on the Anhui River: Datong, Wuhu. The construction funds were borrowed from Shanghai banks by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>(Negotiating in Bengbu)</p>
<p>Shanghai banks such as China Bank and the Bank of Communications have each appointed representatives to go to Bengbu to negotiate loans with the Huaiyin Transport Envoy of the Salt Affairs Office. Guarantee items, interest, and all procedures are reportedly borrowed for a total of 10 million yuan, but may need to be changed. In the future, 60% will be used to build salt warehouses, and 40% will be used to handle the construction of factories for receiving workers at Twelve Wharfs to build salt and hemp bags.</p>
<p>(Organizing a Syndicate)</p>
<p>The banks involved in the negotiations and responsible for the loan are China Bank, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Jincheng Bank, Yanye Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Xingye Bank, etc. After the negotiation is successful, it is decided to organize a banking syndicate to handle it. As for the signing of the loan contract, it will have to wait until the bank representatives who went to Bengbu return to Shanghai before a decision can be made. In the future, the signatories will be (1) the Ministry of Finance, (2) the banking syndicate organized by various banks.</p>

<p>Six-Li British Gold Bonds</p>
<p>Sold Out Immediately After Announcement of Subscription</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Banks Eagerly Purchased</p>
<p>Overseas Sales Were Suspended Due to This</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Ministry of Railways, in order to complete the Yuehan Railway, issued £1.5 million of 6% British Gold Gengzi Indemnity Bonds for the Republic of China Year 23, guaranteed by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds. These bonds were underwritten by the four banks: Bank of China, Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and HSBC. The bond certificates were printed and distributed on the first of this month, and the underwriting banks immediately announced their subscription. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the banking community yesterday that since the four banks underwrote these bonds, Shanghai's Chinese and foreign banks have considered the guarantee reliable and have actively subscribed. As a result, they were sold out in full. The bonds are in denominations of £50, £100, and £1,000. The repayment of principal and interest in the future will also be handled by the four underwriting banks.</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce Sends a Congratulatory Telegram</p>
<p>The Federation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce in the Dutch East Indies is Established</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Java, Sumatra, and Borneo Jointly Organized and Will Officially Establish Today</p>
<p>Chinese merchants in Nanyang, especially in the Dutch East Indies, are the most numerous. They are scattered in various places and have no contact with each other. Although there are Chinese Chambers of Commerce in various places, they each seek their own interests and do not communicate with each other. In recent years, Nanyang has been affected by the global economic downturn, and overseas Chinese in Nanyang have been greatly affected. Therefore, they feel the need to communicate. Previously, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in East Sumatra had already been established. Now, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and other regions have initiated the organization of the Federation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce in the Dutch East Indies. The inaugural meeting will be convened today at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Batavia, Java, with the participation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce from various ports. The incoming and outgoing telegrams of the National Federation of Commerce are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Educational News from China</p>
<h3>Closing of the Annual Meeting of the Science Society of China</h3>
<h3>Chairman Chiang and His Wife Host Sincerely</h3>
<h3>Papers Presented Show Achievements in Various Disciplines</h3>
<h3>Next Annual Meeting to Be Held in Wuzhou, Guangxi</h3>
<p>First Day</p>
<p>(Kuling Correspondent) The annual meeting of the Science Society of China this year was held in Lushan. More than 150 members from universities and academic organizations in various provinces, including Shaanxi, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, attended. Chairman Chiang believed that the gathering of specialized scholars from across the country in a famous mountain to discuss and explore was of great significance to the future of science in our country. Therefore, during his convalescence, he personally hosted them and planned individual conversations. The following is a brief account of the reception held by Chairman Chiang and his wife on the 23rd.</p>
<p>Tea Party: Held at 5:00 PM in the garden of Chiang's residence at No. 13 Special District of Kuling. The garden is surrounded by mountains like a screen, with a stream flowing past the door. Inside, the green grass is like a carpet, and the dense shade blocks the sun. The setting sun shines through the trees, and the cool breeze gently carries the intermittent sound of cicadas. Seats were arranged in a U-shape on the lawn and among the trees in the garden, neatly arranged. Members arrived one after another starting at 4:30 PM, and were received by Chen Bu Lei, Secretary-General Yang Yongtai, Chairman of Jiangxi Xiong Shihui, Director of the Annual Meeting Preparatory Committee (Director of the Jiangxi Office of the National Economic Commission) Xiao Chunjin, Director of the Jiangxi Education Department Cheng Shihui, and Director of the General Affairs Office of the Headquarters Cai Jinjun. Soon, Chairman Chiang and his wife came out together, smiling, and bowed to each member. Chiang wore a blue-gray long gown and appeared quite thin, seemingly due to overwork, but his spirit was still full. Madame Soong Mei-ling wore a white qipao with blue floral patterns, and her demeanor was dignified. Chiang shook hands with Ren Hongjun, Hu Xiansu, and Hu Gangfu one by one, and invited them to sit down with a sincere attitude. After light refreshments, Chiang inquired in detail about the progress of the Science Society, the content of the annual meeting, and future development plans from the President of the Science Society Ren Hongjun and the directors and Secretary-General Yang Yunzhong, expressing his respect, admiration, and hope. He stated that the development of practical science to save lives was important for our group and race. They talked for about ten minutes. President Ren stood up and said that Chairman Chiang had come during his medical rest to cordially receive his colleagues, and it was a great honor to see his demeanor and gather together. However, the Chairman should not overwork and could not speak too much. He would meet with them individually for detailed discussions later. All the guests stood up and bowed to Chiang. Chiang then walked inside to rest. Subsequently, Madame Soong Mei-ling shook hands with each member one by one to express her respect. The evening mist rose before the joyful gathering dispersed.</p>
<p>The 23rd was the second day of the Science Society's annual meeting. In the morning, the entire group divided into groups of botany, zoology, geography, and physics/chemistry to present papers. The groups presented a total of more than one hundred papers, all the crystallized research of specialized scholars, with many unique perspectives on various scientific, academic, engineering, and practical developments. In the afternoon, the members were free to visit and explore the scenic spots of Fanyan, and the groups also engaged in academic gatherings after their tours. The botany group visited Hanpo Pass, attended the founding ceremony of the botanical garden, and held a picnic to discuss association affairs. The Geographical Society held a tea party on the cliffs of Datianchi to discuss the progress of the society, which was also a joyful event.</p>
<p>Second Day</p>
<p>(Kuling Correspondent) The second and third days of the 19th annual meeting of the Science Society of China were both dedicated to presenting papers in three groups and reporting on research from each group. At the same time, the zoological, botanical, and geographical societies participating in the conference held their respective association meetings. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Institute of Biology: Subsidized by the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, it was divided into two groups: (A) The Zoology Group, Beiping Jingsheng Institute of Biology, was led by Hu Xiansu, directly under the Zoology Department of the Science Society, and directed by Director Nong Zhi. The work over the past year includes the "Economic Fish of Coastal China" by Bing Zhi et al., and 25 reports. Projects in progress include the comparison of the organization of the Nanjing lizard department, a compilation of Chinese carp, protozoa parasitic in the intestines of domestic animals in Nanjing, the structure of Tritrichomonas foetus, and its 16 components. The collection of specimens has not yet yielded results. Wang Jiaji et al. were sent to Xiamen to collect coral, sea anemones, and saltwater and freshwater fish, while Wang Yikang et al. trekked through central and southern China, collecting arthropods, mollusks, and various types of fish, shrimp, snakes. They also formed the Nanyang Biological Science Collection Group in conjunction with the Jingsheng Biological Investigation Institute, the Academia Sinica, and the Natural History Museum. Those who recently returned brought back rare items such as radiant corals, giant starfish, and hawksbill turtles from the tropics and subtropics. The number of specimens has reached 80,000, totaling more than 5,500 species. At the opening of this Science Society's annual meeting, animal research accounted for more than 70 of the hundred-plus papers. Nong Zhi was re-elected as the president of the Zoological Society. (B) The Botany Group was led by Qian Zongshu, president of the Botanical Society. The results of the research included 34 articles such as "The Nanjing Water Mianalgae Chronicle" and "A Method for Separating Fungal Spores." Unfinished research includes nine items such as "The Flora of Mount Emei in Sichuan." In terms of plant specimens, they recently formed an expedition with the College of Agriculture of China University to collect plants from the Burmese border. As commissioned by the National Defense Committee, they dispatched expeditions to Anhui and Jiangxi to collect plants, as well as to Qinghai and Gansu. More than 36,000 specimens were donated. The Geographical Society was presided over by Zhu Kezhen. This year, there were also many research papers presented at the conference. In addition, several other societies are about to be established.</p>
<p>Moreover, the members of the association have been touring the scenic spots of Kuanglu and exploring secluded places for days, scaling cliffs and walls, feeling joyous and reluctant to leave. The provincial government hosted a banquet on the evening of the 23rd, with Xiao Chunjin, a member of the committee, acting as host, reporting on the recent political reforms in Jiangxi Province, the relief of rural areas, the progress of the nine major factories, and the completion of the main lines to various provinces, with the branch lines in various counties either completed or under construction. All members believed that Jiangxi has the most hope for becoming the starting point for the revival of China. On the 24th, Li Zhongxiang, Director of the Jiujiang Municipal Committee, Bao Gongren, Magistrate of Jiujiang County, and Jiang Zhicheng, Director of the Changshan Management Bureau, jointly hosted a banquet at Huierkang, with Director Li reporting on the construction progress of Jiujiang City and the relief efforts for the drought and famine. Magistrate Bao followed with an apology for the inadequate hospitality. Hu Xiansu and others gave speeches in response, emphasizing that construction relies heavily on experts, and hoped that scientists would not hesitate to advance despite difficulties.</p>
<p>Third Day</p>
<p>(Kuling Correspondent) The 25th was the last day of the Science Society of China's annual meeting. The general meeting of all members was held at 9 AM. Due to many lingering in the mountains and waters, attendance was sparse. It seems the free spirit of this year's annual meeting and the captivating scenery of Lushan were distractions. Presided over by Ren Hongjun, the important resolutions included: (1) The 20th annual meeting will be held in Wuzhou, Guangxi. (2) Future annual meetings will be divided into groups for investigation, such as education, engineering, social sciences, botany, zoology, and geography. Each group will designate individuals to take responsibility for reception. Local members will be responsible for conducting investigations, providing guidance, and supplying statistics to facilitate writing papers. All banquets will be absolutely avoided. (3) In terms of expanding the organization, the geographical, physical/chemical, botanical, zoological, engineering, and biological societies are welcomed to participate in the compilation of popular science books for the general public in four groups to expand the science movement. Finally, the issue of the separation and integration of the association with various societies was discussed and left for resolution at the next session. The meeting adjourned at 12 noon. A public banquet was held at 7 PM. The 26th was for free visits. On the 27th, they will go to Nanchang for public lectures or visit the bandit suppression areas.</p>
<p>End of the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Agricultural Society</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 27th) The 17th annual meeting of the Chinese Agricultural Society was declared closed on the 27th. The original plan for all members to depart in groups in the morning for visits was canceled due to the holiday for the commemoration of Confucius's birthday. Only the Central Jindai and Astronomical Research Institute were visited. Members from other provinces have successively left Nanjing. The next annual meeting will be decided after the new directors are elected.</p>
<p>Relief Efforts for Northeastern Students by the Northeastern Youth Education Relief Office of the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>Regarding the subsidizing of Northeastern students studying in Europe and America, the Northeastern Youth Relief Office of the Ministry of Education divides them into two categories: government-funded students and self-funded students. Government-funded students generally receive a subsidy of 1,800 yuan per year per person. Self-funded students receive a one-time subsidy, which is not continuous, generally a maximum of 800 yuan per person and a minimum of 400 yuan, according to regulations, depending on the country of study, the subject of study, and the student's economic situation. The Relief Office for Education has investigated Northeastern students studying in Europe and America. As of now, there are 28 in Germany, 6 in Belgium, 4 in the UK, 9 in France, and 7 in the US, totaling 54 people. (The survey forms for Germany, Belgium, and France were returned by the embassies, while those for the UK and US were submitted by the students themselves.) Among these 54 people, 38 government-funded and self-funded students have been approved for subsidies after review. The Relief Office's budget for subsidizing Northeastern students studying in Europe and America is only 3,000 yuan per month. However, from the establishment of the office in February of this year to the end of June, more than 27,000 yuan has been remitted to students in five months (3,000 yuan per month for five months would only be 15,000 yuan). The excess of more than 12,000 yuan is said to be due to 15,000 yuan that the Ministry of Education had previously allocated to subsidize Northeastern students studying in Germany. After deducting the more than 4,000 yuan directly remitted by the ministry, the remaining amount was transferred to the Relief Office for overall allocation when it was established. Therefore, with this injection, the revenue and expenditure can still be offset. The Relief Office will fund three students to study in Europe and America this year (Wang Baohuan, Liu Quanzhong, Jin Xiwu), select four more next year, and five more the year after, totaling twelve. Each student will receive an average of 250 yuan per month. By the third year, the 3,000 yuan budget will be completely exhausted. At that time, the government-funded and self-funded students who went abroad before September 18th will have completed their studies and will no longer need subsidies. Therefore, the funding of students year by year from this year onward will be gradual and will not affect the Relief Office's budget.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Education Department Promulgates Uniform Regulations for Middle School Student Uniforms</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department held a training conference in June of this year.

As the new semester is about to begin, student uniforms need to be prepared urgently. The approved resolutions, along with drawings, are hereby printed and distributed for compliance and unification. However, for the sake of the students' family economy, students who are already enrolled and whose existing uniform styles and colors differ from those stipulated in the above regulations may be exempted from remaking their uniforms at the discretion of the school to save costs. In addition, work clothes set by the school are not within the scope of uniforms. The unified regulations for student uniforms in Zhejiang Province are as follows:</p>

<p>Tokyo Big Scandal in Education Circles</p>
<p>Collusion with the School Inspector's Chief to Sell Principalships</p>
<p>Using Geisha House Banquets as Negotiation Conditions</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Kokumin Shinbun on the 11th, the preliminary hearing of the major scandal in the Imperial capital's education circles has concluded. A total of 41 former principals and others were found guilty of accepting bribes to sell principalships. A brief description of their crimes is as follows: 1. The appointment and dismissal of elementary school principals in the various counties under Tokyo Prefecture were decided by the suggestions of the school inspectors after a meeting of all the inspectors and the chief of the Tokyo City School Section. However, inspectors such as Yokogou, Koyama, and Kokufu accepted gift certificates or cash of several hundred yuan to promote instructors and appoint principals to elementary schools. 2. The inspectors and those who sought promotion often held banquets in geisha houses, using the geisha houses as places to receive bribes and negotiate conditions. 3. Colluding with bookstore owners to have schools purchase textbooks and notebooks, thereby seeking profit and acting as intermediaries for both parties. 4. Lobbying the chief of the Tokyo Municipal Education Bureau to submit the appointment of principals to the selection committee. As a result, as many as 50 people were involved. After investigation by various parties, 41 people were indicted.</p>

<p>Establishment of the Contemporary Youth Society</p>
<p>Guiding Youth in Education, Career, and Marriage Issues</p>
<p>Submitting a Request to the Government to Provide Relief to University Graduates</p>
<p>The Contemporary Youth Society held its inaugural meeting yesterday morning at 9:00 AM at the Minli Girls' Middle School, attended by more than 100 people including Lai Zhongwen, Xing Wan, Zhou Hanmei, Zhu Xiaochun, Tong Muge, Chen Guangyu, and Chen Dongbai. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Proposed Resolutions Passed: After opening with the customary formalities, Chairman Lai Zhiwen and Recorder Tong Muge reported on the preparatory process, and then passed the charter and discussed the following proposals: (1) Many university graduates become unemployed after graduation. How should the society express its attitude? It was resolved (A) to request the government to solve the problem as soon as possible, and (B) to issue a letter to the youth, encouraging them to pay attention to the cultivation of productive capacity during their studies, and to actively save themselves and strive to advance on the path of production after graduation. (2) It was resolved to advance the establishment of the vocational introduction center, and the resolution was passed and handed over to the board of directors for handling. (3) It was resolved to promptly prepare for the society's guidance on youth's education and marriage issues, and the resolution was passed and handed over to the board of directors for handling. (4) It was resolved to promote the realization of the ten work plans stipulated in the society's charter, and the resolution was passed and handed over to the board of directors for active implementation. (5) It was resolved to actively recruit members to enrich the society's internal structure, and the resolution was passed to be the responsibility of all members for referrals. (6) It was resolved to publish the Youth Guide, and the resolution was passed and handed over to the board of directors for handling. (7) It was resolved to hire famous scholars as consultants to the society, and the resolution was passed and handed over to the board of directors for handling.</p>
<p>Election of Directors: Then the directors were elected. The elected directors were: Executive Directors: Lai Zhiwen, Xing Wan, Sun Bo; Directors: Zhou Hanmei, Zhu Xiaochun, Zheng Jingguang, Chen Guangyu, Zhang Runmin, Wang Guoping, Chen Dongbai, Yang Yuzhen, Gao Wanbai, Yang Huaixin, Xing Yili, Deng Hui; Executive Supervisors: Tong Muge; Supervisors: Li Erbai, Li Ming, Zeng Zhennan, Wu Youhua.</p>
<p>Work Plans: The society passed the following ten work plans: (1) Guiding youth's education; (2) Guiding youth's career problems; (3) Guiding youth's marriage problems; (4) Organizing a vocational introduction center; (5) Organizing academic research meetings; (6) Introducing scholars to give lectures or holding member lecture meetings; (7) Publishing regular publications and social works; (8) Planning bookstores and libraries; (9) Organizing correspondence schools, supplementary schools, or primary and secondary schools; (10) Organizing social investigation groups or tour groups.</p>
<p>Declaration: The society's declaration is as follows: The decline of the national consciousness of the Chinese people has reached its extreme. "Do one day's work as a monk and ring the bell for one day," "Enjoy today's wine, worry about tomorrow's money," although they are common sayings used by women and children, the Chinese people's attitude of getting by and ignoring everything is exactly the same. Although the general youth bears the mission of the nation and the country, when examined, the will of the contemporary youth mostly adopts the attitude of "disliking the past, perfunctorily dealing with the present, and ignoring the future." The result of this will is that, on a small scale, it can be said to ruin one's life, and on a large scale, it becomes a precursor to the demise of the nation and the country. The severity of the disaster can make us shudder. If contemporary youth are to fulfill their mission, the change of their will is the only essential element, and "reviewing the past, grasping the present, and creating the future" is the only way out for the will of contemporary youth. However, this is only a passive change, and active construction requires even more "scientific methods to review the past, implementing a new life to grasp the present, and cultural construction to create the future," so that the decadent will of the past can be swept away and the mission that the youth should bear can be assumed. The society is keenly aware of this, so it specifically contacts youth from all over the country, and is committed to academic research with a spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation in service, to understand the past, and is committed to cultural construction to create the future. At the same time, it encourages youth to implement a new life to grasp the present. However, the suffering of the general youth, unemployment, lack of education, educational advancement, and marriage problems are everywhere showing the deep panic of contemporary youth. Although these sufferings are caused by the above-mentioned decadent will, the current economic panic and political turmoil are the source of this suffering. In addition to striving for active construction and seeking a way out for the will of contemporary youth, the society is still responsible for the current relief. For the problems of youth's unemployment, educational advancement, and marriage, the society is determined to serve the youth with all its strength and fulfill the responsibility of guidance and relief, so that the suffering or panic of contemporary youth can be comforted or resolved even a little.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen Culture and Education Center</p>
<p>Will Establish Scholarship for Students Studying Abroad</p>
<p>The Scholarship is Tentatively Set at 50,000 Yuan per Year</p>
<p>The Sun Yat-sen Culture and Education Center, in view of the fact that China has no mechanism for assessing the lives of government-funded and self-funded students studying abroad after they go abroad, and their achievements when they return to China, plans to set up a scholarship for students studying abroad to promote culture and reward youth. First, a committee will be established to investigate the actual situation of students studying abroad in various countries. The amount of the scholarship is tentatively set at 50,000 yuan per year. After experts review the learning experience and practical experience submitted each semester, awards will be given to the best.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony of Minli Girls' Middle School in Autumn</p>
<p>Guomin News reported that Minli Girls' Middle School on Wenmiao Road in the South City has been reorganized since the last semester and is even more determined to rectify itself. Therefore, the number of students has increased sharply this semester. Because the original school building is insufficient, a four-story steel and cement building is specially built on the remaining land of the original site to accommodate them. It is reported that the school held its autumn opening ceremony yesterday. At 10:00 AM, Principal Tong Xingbai presided over the meeting. Chairman Wu Xingya of the board of directors, as well as more than 800 school board members, faculty, staff, and students attended. After performing the ceremony, the chairman reported on the school's current situation and facilities. Then Wu Xingya gave a speech, encouraging all students to study hard so that they could serve the country and society after graduation. The ceremony ended and dispersed at 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>School News</p>
<p>(Suzhou Shanghai Primary School) Suzhou Shanghai Primary School, located at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Datong Road, held its autumn opening ceremony yesterday afternoon and held a welcome ceremony for the new principal. The new principal Lu Zhushuang, school directors Gu Zipan and Pan Yansheng, and more than 280 new and old students attended. First, School Director Xu Lianfang chaired and gave a welcome speech on behalf of the school's teachers and students. Then the principal and school directors gave training speeches one after another. Finally, Dean of Studies Zhu Baoxi reported on the academic performance of students in the past three years and the addition of library science instrument rooms, hygiene, fire protection, and other equipment. Classes will officially start on the 28th. It is reported that there are still places available in each grade.</p>
<p>(Zhengxing Girls' Middle School) Zhengxing Girls' Middle School, located north of Ximolu Jing'an Temple Road, has received enthusiastic applications from all over the country since its enrollment. In order to improve the academic level, the school's entrance examination is very strict. Therefore, only more than 100 people have been admitted.

<p>Emperor. While they are busy pulling Litvinov into Geneva, they are also busy building airplanes and warships. While the gold yuan government is certainly engaged in a large-scale mobilization for disaster relief, its main focus is still on redrawing the world map with cannons and bayonets. Finally, let's talk about the "Russians" whose colors are rather "unreasonable." In that country, a major drought has also occurred this year, spreading across Europe and Asia. According to general speculation, at least several million Red Army soldiers or "bandits from afar" should starve to death this year, along with tens of millions of peasants, so that the likes of Hitler in Germany or Araki Sadao in Japan can "raise a big toast." "Unfortunately," the Russian devils are indeed formidable. Relying on the organized efforts and struggles of the peasants, they have actually conquered the drought demon and obtained a harvest that is no less than usual. This miracle will not only enrage all anti-Moscow factions who share a common hatred, but will even frighten God. Looking at the above facts, we can see that although it is the same drought, the responses of various countries are very different. Generally speaking, the characteristic of the spiritual life of the Chinese is fatalism and nonchalance, which can also be said to be "great." Americans seem to believe in God, but in reality, they believe in poison gas and cannons. The "Russian devils" can be described as "fearless of heaven and earth." Because they are too fierce, everyone has to give way to them. Sickness and Life  Nai Shuo</p>
<p>For five years, I have been like this, enduring a summer of torment. My weight, which is over one hundred and thirty pounds, always drops to just around one hundred pounds. It's like this every year, as if summer is my "enemy," with whom I have no friendship whatsoever. That would be fine, but when autumn arrives, there should be a new turning point to restore my weight to its previous level and to praise "autumn" with the smiles of ordinary people. But that's not the case. Autumn inflicts even more cruel punishment on me. For the past five years, I have always gotten sick in the autumn. It's like this every year, no matter how much I try to prevent it, I can't avoid it. Speaking of it, although my "humble body" is not very strong, it is not particularly weak either. At least, I have a belief that I can withstand any kind of torment. In previous years, I had only covered myself with a thin, tattered cotton blanket on snowy winter nights and didn't get sick. After January 28th, I spent two full days hungry on the train back to my hometown, but I was still generally strong. No, when I arrived at my doorstep, my late mother came out to greet me, and I remember her even saying that I looked a bit fatter. But as soon as autumn arrives, I have to prepare to get sick (because prevention is absolutely impossible). This kind of illness, for me, is truly a "seasonal illness." Actually, it's not that serious, so although I get sick every year, I haven't lost my life. The type of illness is diarrhea. From the beginning to recovery, it often takes about a week. During this week, seeking medical advice and taking medicine are completely useless. Although it's useless, after the week is over, it will get better even without medicine. However, the most difficult part is this one week. When it's urgent, there's almost not enough time to take down my pants. My mouth feels like it really needs to eat something, but when I eat, I can't taste anything, and it just "doesn't agree" with me. I can't even finish half a piece of fruit before I get tired of it. But my stomach keeps discharging so much stuff, until it's completely water. It takes many days to stop. I originally had considerable experience with illness (this is really a terrible thing to say). I was sick for a whole year when I was sixteen, so I'm not too afraid. Only this kind of "seasonal illness" makes me feel particularly anxious. After having diarrhea for a week, even if my body was fine, I look like a ghost. When I look in the mirror, I can't help but tremble. Then, several thoughts flood into my mind, swirling around endlessly, until I'm mentally and physically exhausted, and then I fall into a dazed stupor. In my life, I have always felt that life is painful! Especially for the wealthy, even though they can reach the highest peak of material enjoyment, indulging in whatever they desire and enjoying everything to the fullest, when they get sick to the point where even the "cow doctor" is ineffective, their suffering is inescapable, and their pain is always a flaw in their perfection. As for the poor, needless to say, when they are healthy, they have to endure the hardships of life, so much so that they can barely breathe. Once illness strikes, it's even more unbearable. They don't even have the elements they usually rely on to resist and fight. God is so cruel to people. It's really infuriating! So, I think life has no happiness at all, and it seems to have no meaning. If there is any, it's only to be forever free from illness, to be a healthy iron man for life. In my life, I most envy those healthy people who are truly blessed angels. Some people think that "being sick is a kind of art in life." I don't know how they can say that. Melancholy and sickly people, where is your joy and happiness? Life is cruel, it is lonely! This is what many people are shouting. Indeed, I deeply feel this. However, people are, after all, emotional animals. Normally, it's hard to endure a cruel and lonely life, but when sick, they are even more eager to break through this demonic isolation and gain a comforting aspect of life. When I told my friends about my illness, the comfort they sent in their letters made me so grateful. Moreover, several friends bothered to visit, which made me so excited that it was as if the illness had completely left my body. My spirits were particularly good, and my mood was particularly comfortable. I think that illness cannot be cured with medicine; only the comfort of sincere friendship is the strong enemy of illness. At least, I believe this. (The End) Like a Dream  Yun Zhi</p>
<p>If we let the huge iron wheel represent the times, then it is it, this cruel iron wheel! It grinds the present into the past, the past into memory, and memory into dreams.</p>
<p>And now: even the dream of the past, like smoke, has disappeared.</p>
<p>(Isn't there: the small grass of the hometown, the melancholy garden, the blurry face of the mother, and the eyes and smiles of childhood longing? Yes, there is also the buried heart of childhood, the world of childhood.)</p>
<p>The sun of childhood is like a dream.</p>
<p>But: also remembering the past society.</p>
<p>(The past days were prosperous, and the society was also "prosperous"(?); people tilled the land, fought with sticks, held official positions, and did business, as if the whole family had nothing to do with it. Fried dough sticks sold for only two cents on the street, and white porridge was one cent a bowl. People did "Jiangbai Da," worked as compradores, small bureaucrats, and engaged in financial enterprises.)</p>
<p>Who could see the prelude to a grand landscape hidden behind it?</p>
<p>Oh, prosperous times. The enjoyment of one's own family is abundant. In the eyes of the abundant enjoyers, society should have a prosperous face, right? That's right, I said, and others said, "These times are not bad."</p>
<p>However, but can this also be called a dream? If so, then what does the entire history of mankind represent? But, looking at that blurry moment, it really feels a bit like a dream: hasn't the world changed? Yes, in the process of the rise, fall, and re-rise of the petty bureaucrats, the abundant enjoyment of one's own family has also been destroyed. What is heard is: one's own misfortune, the misfortune of the farmers, the misfortune of the landlords, the misfortune of the merchants.</p>
<p>(What kind of world is that?)</p>
<p>What kind of world is that? - What's the use of asking more! What one's own family needs is no longer the enjoyment of life, but the necessities of life. The instinct for survival can make people brave. With the panic of starvation, they stood up and walked out: "Let's go and see what's in society."</p>
<p>Struggling, living, learning.</p>
<p>(People say: If memories are like dreams, at least dreams are not worth thinking about.</p>
<p>People say: The past is decadent; isn't it like a worthless broken shoe, throw it away?</p>
<p>People say: People rolling around in the terrifying waves of life should not have a past.</p>
<p>People say........)</p>
<p>So he turned around: "Cheap sentimentalist," he teased, stroking the tail of a dream.</p>
<p>What is being teased is not something else, but life, the very essence of life.</p>
<p>Like this: Then, with a ruthless heart, he cut off the tail of the past dream.</p>
<p>Look at this dialogue;</p>
<p>(- One's own family has no past and no future: Memories and hopes are all the accessories of the gentry class?</p>
<p>- Does this mean there is nothing?</p>
<p>- What? Isn't there the real "present"? The past and the future are like dreams; only the existing reality is real, bloody.</p>
<p>- But the bloody "present" can also be a dream; and won't the dreamlike also be bloody?</p>
<p>- I don't want to think about this.</p>
<p>- Of course you can not think about it: "A mermaid swimming in life, in the dangerous waves of life!"</p>
<p>He became silent, embarrassed, yet savoring the teasing with interest.)</p>
<p>"A mermaid in the terrifying waves of life," but the past and the future are like dreams. Old Woman Asong Wu Fei</p>
<p>"Cough! Cough! Cough! Cough!" A burst of rapid, continuous coughing told me that Old Woman Asong had lit the kerosene lamp again.</p>
<p>Indeed, Old Woman Asong got up coughing every day before the sky was fully light, as soon as she saw a wisp of white light entering through the cracks in the tiles. She pressed her chest, especially suppressing her coughs: she was afraid of waking her son and daughter-in-law's sweet dreams and being scolded by them. However, because she tried too hard to hold back the coughs, the old, patched cotton shirt on her body was often soaked through; but she didn't care about this old illness. She still pressed her chest with her left hand, hobbling and stumbling to do the work she had to do every day! Washing the pot, sweeping the floor, wiping the table, heating water for washing her face, cooking breakfast. She arranged everything neatly, just waiting for her son and daughter-in-law to get up, wash their faces, and eat. However, this kind of work was not easy to please. For example, if she put too much water in the rice when cooking, Xinglong - her son - would scold her for being old and useless:</p>
<p>"Old, useless thing, you might as well just die! Mother Ajin next door is two years older than you! She can still help her son cut some firewood or cut grass for the sheep, unlike you, who can't even cook a decent meal." She didn't get angry, but just stood trembling beside him, smiling apologetically.</p>
<p>"I don't know why I put too much water in today. I'll be more careful tomorrow!" But the dishes were especially difficult to manage; if she put too much salt in them, her daughter-in-law would say she was being malicious, putting in salt so they couldn't eat well. If she cooked them bland, she would say that she eats vegetarian food herself, but others can't eat vegetarian with her. If she poured too much oil, she would say that she had capsized the oil boat and deliberately ruined things. If there was too little oil, she would say it was pig food. It was really difficult for her to please anyone. This was not good, and that was bad. In the end, they just thought she was one person too many and blamed her for not dying sooner. But who would pity her? It was still Sister-in-law Jingou next door who often sympathized with her. One day, she was lamenting her suffering with Sister-in-law Jingou:</p>
<p>"Old Woman Asong! You're so old; you should save some energy! There are many things that your daughter-in-law should do. Besides, your cough is so bad!..." Sister-in-law Jingou said kindly. But she shook her head, and red marks appeared on her already sunken eye sockets, and her eyes seemed a little moist. The wrinkles on her forehead deepened a bit.</p>
<p>"No! I only blame myself for being unlucky! Xinglong's father died when he was four years old, and his father didn't leave any inheritance behind, only two segments of the body; finally, relying on ten fingers, I struggled to raise Xinglong. Last year, I got him a wife, and my wish was finally fulfilled. Who knew he would listen to that demon's words and have no conscience..."</p>
<p>"You're just an old cheap thing! I can understand; you're talking bad about your son and daughter-in-law again. Decay! I won't get old; I'll die right away to show you, will you be happy then?" Before she finished speaking, with a crash, Xinglong's wife had already crossed the fence from that side to this side, clapping</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>her hands and stomping her feet, scolding like a tigress, scaring her so much that she didn't say a word and slipped back into the house. Sister-in-law Jingou also felt bored and carried a basket of dirty clothes towards the riverbank. "You old, immortal thing, go and accuse me of being unfilial! I'm unfilial to you, call your son to eat lawsuits and sit in prison, anyway, there are such cheap goods who will help you, you have good relationships, people will cherish you, won't you call people to take care of you!" Xinglong's wife scolded more and more enthusiastically, jumping higher and higher; she was simply like a mad demon, raving wildly. Old Woman Asong cowered in the house, listening to her scolding, listening to her arguing, not daring to make a sound; she just trembled and washed the dishes and cleaned up the leftovers on the table. Xinglong came back from the teahouse in town, heard what his wife said, and scolded her again very happily for being old and useless, old and cheap. It is said that Old Woman Asong didn't eat dinner that day, and many old tears flowed on the pillow; but the next day, she got up as usual. Amateur Mailbox He Plans to Commit Suicide Editor Editor:</p>
<p>A few days ago, a friend, Ma Li, came from the countryside and asked me to solve a difficult problem; otherwise, he has decided to prepare for suicide.</p>
<p>The matter is like this:</p>
<p>Ma Li was originally a teacher at a rural district elementary school, thirty-eight years old, running the "singing big dog, barking small dog, jumping" industry for many years, clever and agile, and known as a "prodigy" in his youth. Four years ago, Ma Li found a woman named Ajuan and became engaged to her. In theory, a pair of lonely men and women could finally have a home. Unexpectedly, four years later, Ma Li became inextricably linked with another woman. Their movements are almost well-known throughout the town, but Miss So-and-so is a person who grew up in an old-fashioned family. Her mother died early, and her father was stubborn by nature. He believed that this matter would hinder the family rules, so he tried to stop it in every possible way. However, their love had reached maturity, and they strengthened their will against external attacks. Moreover, Miss So-and-so was determined not to marry anyone other than Ma Li, so the problem arose:</p>
<p>1. Can Miss So-and-so get engaged to Ma Li on her own without the consent of her parents!</p>
<p>2. What kind of procedures are required to divorce Miss Ajuan!</p>
<p>3. Is it necessary to compensate the other party for losses!</p>
<p>4. Is there another way, that is, not to marry Ajuan, not to cancel the engagement, but to live with Miss So-and-so; is this possible!</p>
<p>Sir, you are the bright lamp in the sea of night and the compass on the vast earth. I hope you can provide a detailed answer to the above questions. If so, not only will the readers be fortunate, Ma Li will be fortunate, Miss So-and-so will be fortunate, but friends with similar situations will also be deeply grateful! Gao Songling</p>
<p>Answer: Your friend's matter is difficult to have a win-win solution. Even if he is determined to commit suicide, he is asking for it. Since he is engaged to Miss Ajuan, he should love her sincerely and should not fall in love with other women again, resulting in today's tragic love triangle. At the same time, the news of your friend's engagement to Miss Ajuan must be known to Miss So-and-so in the small village. Knowing that "the magistrate has a wife," she still "gets along well" with him. The result of men and women "getting along well" is that love problems will naturally arise, trapping themselves in tragedy. They are also inviting pain themselves. However, since the matter has come to this, there are only two ways to resolve it. One, your friend and Miss Ajuan should simply cancel the engagement. Since the other party is not at fault, they should naturally compensate for the losses. As for what kind of procedures are required, they only need to apply to the local court for cancellation of the engagement. Two, your friend should quickly suppress his emotions and "give up love" with Miss So-and-so. Of course, the reasons for "giving up love" should be explained to Miss So-and-so earnestly, so that she can also understand your friend's current difficulties. If your friend can have such a resolute spirit, it is expected that Miss So-and-so will not be unwilling to let go of her personal happiness and let Miss Ajuan be trapped in pain. If Miss So-and-so gets engaged to your friend on her own without the consent of her parents, or if your friend does not marry Ajuan or cancel the engagement but lives with Miss So-and-so, it is also not allowed by law. According to the letter, your friend and Miss Ajuan have no ill feelings towards each other, so it is best to maintain the original agreement. I wonder if you also think this is good?

<p>Fusheng was quick-eyed and said softly that Dad was here. Everyone immediately maintained their original attitude. Old Master Wu deliberately picked up his water pipe and smoked. Father Fu hesitated and walked up to him, calling out "Uncle" twice before saying:</p>
<p>"...In recent years, I have indeed incurred a lot of debt. I have been managing my second brother's property for more than ten years. It is naturally unreasonable to hand it over to my sister-in-law like this now, so my wife..." He said, looking at everyone's faces, and seeing that there was no movement, he continued: "So my wife is willing to fill up the flower powder fields (field rent brought by his wife from her mother's family - Author's Note), but, but, the debts incurred when Fusheng got married, I, I really don't have the ability to pay them."</p>
<p>He finished speaking with great effort, wringing his hands, and sweat hung from the corners of his forehead, but he didn't bother to wipe it away. He directly approached Old Master Wu's face, hoping that Old Master Wu could lighten his sentence.</p>
<p>After smoking a pipe, Old Master Wu slowly put the water pipe on the rosewood table before opening his mouth to ask:</p>
<p>"Fuming, how much flower powder field did your niece-in-law actually bring to the Wu family? Since she cherishes Fusheng, the debts incurred when he got married can also be paid off together, so that people won't say that the stepmother is fierce!"</p>
<p>This was an event that was once rumored in Wujia Town: Although Father Fu's stepmother's family was also a prominent family in the town, it had already declined when it came to her brother, Zhu Quan'gui. Ms. Zhu was an old maid. For some reason, she vowed not to marry when she was young. Her parents saw that she was determined, and the will allocated one-third of the fields for her to manage herself, so Ms. Zhu was quite famous in Wujia Town: in fact, her eccentric temper and roaring nature were also major reasons.</p>
<p>Since the death of both parents, Zhu Quan'gui and his sister had been on good terms, but his sister-in-law, seeing that she had taken away one-third of the property, couldn't help but feel unwilling. Ms. Zhu's will also became active. Coincidentally, Father Fu's first wife passed away, and the matchmaker came to the door to discuss with her brother, and it was unexpectedly successful. At that time, those who liked to gossip compiled a folk song saying:</p>
<p>Black walled door by the Wujia Bridge,</p>
<p>Good luck, the wife kicked, (meaning died - Author's Note)</p>
<p>Marry a treasure into the house,</p>
<p>Three thousand acres of land, hahaha laugh.</p>
<p>This was jealousy born of envy. Once the folk song was compiled, many children sang it in front of Father Fu's door all day long. Father Fu did not interfere. Later, when they learned that Ms. Zhu's field rents were all wasteland (the worst yielding fields - Author's Note), this folk song naturally disappeared.</p>

<p>"Shen Bao" Local Supplement Film Special The Film Cleaning Movement in Various Circles in the United States (Part 2) Mi Tong</p>
<p>~~Archbishop Viciously Criticizes Filmmakers~~</p>
<p>~~Cecil B. DeMille's Defense~~</p>
<p>The following is a speech by Cecil B. DeMille defending the Hollywood film industry:</p>
<p>"I have no intention of defending Hollywood's sins, whatever they may be, but I have a few words to say about the current reform movement, because it seeks the destruction of Hollywood. I feel that any movement that aims to destroy in order to satisfy someone's desire for destruction is unforgivable. For example, if a branch of a tree has a rotten spot, do you have to cut down the whole tree? Vulgar things, whether on the screen, in books, or in newspapers, are unnecessary but inevitable. Vulgar things are produced by lazy minds. Lazy minds cannot create meaningful things. I often encounter vulgar things in theaters or in books. Every morning, newspapers also provide some terrifying accounts. But, for example, if I encounter these vulgar things, I will never go to the theater, read books, or read newspapers again, can I be considered a knowledgeable person? When I say that I do not want to defend Hollywood's sins, I want to tell you that Hollywood, or the film industry, is not a simple unit, but a multitude of units, composed under different minds. Now, because of the sins of a few minorities, the whole is being punished. Can this be said to be fair?</p>
<p>"It is inevitable that Hollywood is often attacked by one force or another. Human thoughts and attention are directed by Hollywood. Hollywood's audience is estimated to be at least 600 million people in various countries around the world. Because it has this ideological power, it has authority. Because it has authority, it is often attacked from the outside. The ideas put forward by Hollywood, if discussed even slightly, arouse the indiscriminate attacks of reformers on films. According to them, the crime wave in the United States is entirely caused by Hollywood. But the same films are also shown in the United Kingdom, do they have a crime wave? Furthermore, when it comes to the crime wave itself, I think reformers should first reflect on themselves. Aren't reformers the creators of Prohibition? And Prohibition is the root cause of crime. Morality has created crime, and it will take decades for the United States to recover from the evils caused by that 'honorable experiment.' The reformers' past claims have also been ridiculous. They once attacked automobiles, saying they were against human nature. They said walking was also a sin, unless it was on Sunday to go to church. I don't believe that half of the social evils they talk about are caused by Hollywood. I don't believe that children's minds can be poisoned by watching movies to the point of becoming bandits. Hollywood does not have the ability to create human nature.</p>
<p>"When it comes to opposing obscene films, I ask myself that my efforts are no less than anyone else's, but I feel that the laws proposed by the reformists are not the appropriate answer. Nor is film censorship. We have censorship, but the censors have different opinions. A film that is deemed immoral and banned by Walter, is passed by Pennsylvania, or a film that is not passed by Pennsylvania, is passed by Walter. Does morality also vary by region? If reformers have no movement and no food to eat, let them oppose feuds, kidnapping, robbery, etc., why must they be against films? I believe that to a certain extent, Hollywood also has only itself to blame. There are a few traitors in the film industry who produced some unnecessary obscene films, arousing the opposition of ubiquitous reformers. But this situation has already been automatically corrected by Hollywood. Hollywood itself has realized that obscene and impure films are not enough to attract and generate profits. They have organized their own automatic censorship mechanism, long before reformers began attacking Hollywood."</p>
<p>Indeed, the films considered the greatest successes of 1933 include "Little Women," "Cavalcade," and "Lady for a Day," all of which promote human ethics and morality and are beneficial to the world and people's hearts. The productions of the first half of 1934 have not yet been statistically analyzed, but it can be said that the end of extravagant films has arrived. What is the only crisis now? It is that reformers generally believe they have achieved victory and take credit for it, and believe that their movement is correct and work even harder on their destructive work! (The End) Film Review "Roar of Tigers, Cry of Apes" Ling He</p>
<p>-- Shanxi Screening --</p>
<p>Smart film merchants, when they speculate, must also consider the techniques or means of speculation; otherwise, if they speculate blindly, they will inevitably suffer a severe failure. For example, films about wild animals, in terms of their novelty effect, can achieve good business results. For example, "Tarzan the Ape Man" was able to cause a sensation for a while, and still had good gains in film art. Therefore, the success in film art ultimately determines its business success. At the same time, the producers used a lot of capital to go to Africa to capture real scenery, which is not impossible to satisfy the curiosity of the petty bourgeois audience. However, when Chinese film merchants make animal films, they can only have people dress up as gorillas, people dress up as tigers, and cut and paste some old film clips from foreign animal films. This method naturally cannot satisfy the audience's desire for novelty. As for the disastrous business failure, that is even more inevitable.</p>
<p>We understand that it is impossible for small Chinese companies with capital of two or three thousand yuan to go to Africa or Myanmar to film the true images of animals, no matter what. Therefore, they should make some works that they can afford to make within their economic capacity. But they want to take shortcuts and produce crudely, which inevitably undermines the Chinese film culture movement.</p>
<p>Everyone must admit that the reason why the products of small companies often fall below the horizontal line is the lack of economic resources. Therefore, cutting corners in the works and the superficial and mediocre talent are inevitable results. We certainly don't need to advise the small companies to pool capital and form larger companies, but taking rural or factory themes with a very serious attitude will at least not cost much in terms of scenery. In this way, if they accurately grasp the theme and strive for film culture very seriously, they will inevitably gain the sympathy and forgiveness of the audience, even when there are still some shortcomings in some parts.</p>
<p>Especially in terms of so-called talent, we are even more disappointed. Some people say that some Chinese directors not only do not understand film art, but even lack common sense. For example, China is not tropical, so there are no large palm trees or other tropical plants, but we often see that the upper scene in several animal films is trees such as pine and fir, while the next scene, in the same area, has coconuts. "Savage Adventure" is like this, and "Roar of Tigers, Cry of Apes" is also like this. We understand that the foreign scenery of coconuts is cut from foreign films, but it does not match the plot, so we do not need it. Furthermore, if they have common sense, what is the clothing of the uncivilized or semi-civilized people left in China today, such as the naked Yi and various ethnic groups? What are their living habits? Before starting filming, the director must have a considerable understanding of them, or seek our common sense from books, but the director of "Roar of Tigers, Cry of Apes" cannot even do this. He very superficially learns from the animal films taken from Africa, taking large rings on the noses of the natives, baring their upper bodies, holding spears in their hands, and also having women naked and doing grass skirt dances, moving the Chinese "borderland" to Africa. Isn't this too lacking in common sense?</p>
<p>But on the other hand, the director unnecessarily shows the naked bathing of women more than twice (and the actresses can't swim, they can only pretend to swim), and so-called strange people will offer fruits to the mother ape dressed up as a person. The tiger dressed up as a person will pounce on people, and the wooden crocodile will also devour people. What is even more ridiculous is that the completely uncivilized natives will also understand the Three Principles of the People, and even the strange people raised by the mother ape can speak literary language.</p>
<p>All of the above do not talk about any film art at all. The so-called theme of "reclamation" or "propaganda work" is just a nice term. Review of "World Without Sun" Yi Zhi</p>
<p>Delnge - Great Shanghai -</p>
<p>This is an unreasonable and absurd film made by RKO following the box office success of "King Kong".</p>
<p>According to the story, this film is divided into three major sections that do not merge. The first section is the great earthquake and tsunami, and the world is destroyed. The second section is the struggle for survival of the surviving people. The third section is a love triangle between a man and two women. In the producer's purpose, the first section is probably to use "King Kong" style photography techniques to let the audience see the destruction of New York. The second section is to use the methods of serial dramas and westerns from thirty years ago to let the audience see the brave primitive man's posture in the style of "Robinson Crusoe". The third section is to use the traditional American style of love triangle to adjust the taste of the petty bourgeoisie. In the producer's "business eye," this configuration may have been a bleak business. But unfortunately, this film, in addition to showing the original author S.F. Wright's ignorance, superficiality, and absurdity in terms of consciousness, also exposed irreparable shortcomings in the screenwriting of J.Goodrioh, B.Duff, and the director F.E.Feist Jr. The so-called doomsday scene in the first section only gives us an impression similar to children's play. The description before the disaster strikes, and the connection between Trick and the real scene (such as the storm scene) all show the director's crudeness and incompetence. Especially in the second section, the cliché of the Western style, and the improper handling of the triangular relationship in the third section, such as the relationship between Shannon and Blackmar, and the connection between the two and L. Wilson, are all things that can fully make discerning audiences frown. In the third section, what the play wants to express is the distress of a man caught between his wife and his lover, but as a result, the impression gained by the audience is that it seems that it is not the male character in the play who is suffering because he cannot find a solution, but rather the director of this play, Feist Jr.</p>
<p>The impression after watching the play is very similar to what Mr. Zhitang said about listening to "ghost stories" on the "street". We think that only those who have lost confidence in survival will estimate human power so weakly and boringly. We think that human beings have the power to conquer all these disasters. Movie Novel The Battle to Love (Doctor Monica) (9) Ti Yun</p>
<p>Since that day, Monica has been seeking an answer to the state of affairs; although she walks in reality, that reality is too far away from the past, the accustomed happy life she has experienced. In her heart, she clearly knows that after things have passed, the pain will gradually disappear with numbness, but after a few weeks, waking up every morning, and at all times, everywhere, she feels an emptiness and loss in her heart, which makes her feel that she has no part in John's love, that it can never be restored. This feeling is more real than all the logical realities. She works for long periods of time, working tirelessly, trying to make her mind have no time to stop and think idly, but when it comes to washing her hands, her thoughts are already filled with an indescribable sorrow; when it comes to eating, a feeling of loss that stirs the intestines has already had a dizzying effect in her abdomen, making her unable to swallow; when she throws herself on the bed at night, seeking the comfort of darkness, she cannot immediately fall asleep, and a terrifying loneliness grabs her heart, making her breathe short. At the same time, because Monica's attitude towards her has changed drastically, Mary is also cold and feels hurt. But she never imagined the secret, that her husband was the father of that baby, which Monica now knows. Anna certainly would not tell her either. Later, one day, Monica suddenly fainted between work. Her colleagues knew that she was not in a good mood and was working too hard, so they told her to take a long rest. Although Monica woke up, her body was still very weak. She nodded and agreed. She said she only needed to rest for two weeks. She said her husband was in the mountains, and she could go and play with him. She clenched her bloodless lips, not letting them tremble, she knew that her vacation coincided with her planned schedule.</p>
<p>On the night before the end of that vacation, John rowed a small boat to a place in the lake that they liked the most, where they often watched the sun go down. They sat quietly, silent for a long time, and then Monica said dreamily: "I will never forget this trip in my entire life... I will remember it firmly, just like remembering our honeymoon." John gently reached out and took her, saying: "You know, we should do this often. It's good for both of us! Since we came here, I have completely finished the manuscript of a new book." Monica looked up, leaned on his shoulder, and said slowly: "You are too sweet. I am so grateful in my heart." John lowered his head and looked at her, and asked her strangely: "Why do you say that? Grateful?" Monica said: "But I am really grateful to you. You have been playing with me for these few days, making me forget everything else." She paused for a while and said again: "You think, we are like two old-fashioned couples... You have made this week an incredibly beautiful romance." John gently kissed her cheek and said: "Romance is permanent between us." She suddenly saw that she was</p>

Flags and banners were hung along the streets to welcome the officials into the city of Qufu. They first rested at the Sage's Mansion, where they were received by Kong Deren and other members of the Kong clan. At 7:00 AM, the entire group proceeded from the Sage's Mansion to the Confucius Temple, which had been fully prepared by the Kong clan. Thousands of people from various sectors of Qufu and the Kong clan had also been waiting at the temple. The area in front of the temple was particularly crowded. National flags and Kuomintang flags were crisscrossed over the front and second gates. Representatives from various sectors of Qufu and the Kong clan participated in the ceremony. The locations of the ceremonial seats were clearly marked, and the ground was covered with red carpets and rush mats, in preparation for the ancestral rites. Forty attendants stood in two rows below the stone steps of the Hall of Great Achievement, all wearing blue square scarves and purple floral robes, holding feather dusters. Twenty-six types of ancient musical instruments, such as chimes and bells, were displayed on the stone steps. The area in front of the Hall of Great Achievement was covered with floral carpets, designating the seats for the chief and assisting officiating officials. The interior of the hall was decorated according to ancient rites. An altar table in front of the statue of Confucius was laden with various colored fruits. In front of that were placed the "Tai Lao" (ox, sheep, pig) and "Shao Lao" (sheep, pig) sacrifices. In front of that were displayed four types of Han Dynasty ceremonial vessels and ten types of Zhou Dynasty vessels, known locally as the "Ten Offerings." At the very front were incense burners, candlesticks, and other "Five Offerings." All the ceremonial vessels were rare and priceless treasures. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>Liu Xiang Telegraphs Request to Resign</h3>
<p>Departed Chengdu for Chongqing Some Days Ago</p>
<p>Various Positions Handed Over to Chief of Staff</p>
<p>Lin, Wang, and Chiang Telegraph Condolences and Persuasion to Remain</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Xiang, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan and concurrently Sichuan Rehabilitation Director, left Chengdu by car on the morning of the 23rd of this month, accompanied by a small number of followers. He left a letter for Guo Wenqin, Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, and Li Jianming, Chief of Staff of the Rehabilitation Office, instructing them to (1) hand over the various positions in the Headquarters and Rehabilitation Office to the Chiefs of Staff for acting duties; (2) telegraph Chairman Lin, Premier Wang, and Chairman Chiang, requesting to resign from all his concurrent positions. Upon hearing that Liu had suddenly adopted a passive attitude, reporters inquired with various parties. It was learned that Liu had been working diligently for years in leading the bandit suppression military affairs in Sichuan. The past bandit suppression efforts had been quite successful. However, the recent setback in Wanyuan was due to the uneven pace of the various armies and the failure of a small number of lower-level commanders to understand Liu's intentions, resulting in inappropriate advances and retreats, which led to the setback. As a result, Liu adopted a passive attitude, hence his departure from Chengdu some days ago to request resignation from his positions. It is now reported that Chairman Lin, Premier Wang, and Chairman Chiang, believing that the bandit suppression military affairs in Sichuan could not be without someone in charge, have telegraphed their condolences and persuasion to remain. It is said that Liu's attitude has changed, and he will resume his duties, reorganize, and continue his efforts in bandit suppression military affairs in the coming days.

The response to the reporter's questions was as follows: (1) My doctor in Shanghai, who is treating my diabetes, said that my sugar levels are one-third higher than normal and advised me to rest more. However, I am very busy with government affairs, so that is impossible at this time. (2) I gave a speech to the second term officer corps during my previous visit to Lu, which was well-received.

Regarding the issue of receiving and reorganizing the war zone, he will implement it step by step after going north.

<p>Tax-Evading Goods Through Eastern Chahar</p>
<p>After Setting Up Customs Posts on the Great Wall</p>

<h3>Silver Tax Issue</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) An official from the Ministry of Finance said that according to a survey of banks inside and outside Shanghai when the tael system was abolished and the yuan was adopted last year, the total silver holdings were 500 million yuan. Recently, exports have been reported to be 100 million yuan. The amount is indeed larger than normal exports, but it may have been a temporary surge due to the silver nationalization policies of the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, it is necessary to study whether it is a temporary surge or will become a permanent trend, and then develop a proper countermeasure. Silver as currency is inherently fluid, and it is difficult to tax it, so it is not feasible to do so suddenly. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
