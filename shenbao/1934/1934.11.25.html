<h3 id="c13">海縮談話與政治問題 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>海縮預備會議。開會迄今。已一月有餘。一月前所傳日本之要求。為海軍平等。然經壇玷上之折衝。内幕情勢。不獨絲毫無所進展。且有立即破裂之徵象。此中最大之癥結。即在日本堅欲與英美為實質上之平等。不肯稍作讓步。而英美又未能以同一之步驟力量。應付日本。而最令吾人痛心者。則與海縮問題有密切關係之遠東政治問題。亦竟有一筆抹殺之勢。</p>
<p>吾人嘗謂談判海縮。必須顧及政治問題。否則即無意義可言。蓋海縮之目的。與普遍之軍縮同。其意皆在謀國際和平之確保。侵略行為之終止。非所以奬勵戰争與侵略也。換言之。即海縮而能確保和平終止侵略。則此海縮。始為有意義。不然即海縮自海縮。而戰争仍不能免。侵略仍不能止。亦何貴乎有海縮之空名哉。前次華府海縮會議召開之主旨。原在消弭太平洋上之危機。而遠東和平。尤所注意。至於海縮不過謀達此種和平之手段耳。故此一會議。就大體而言。不失為一有意義有目的之會議。唯其一大失着。即英美雙方以為五·五·三之比率。已足駕御日本而有餘。孰知事實所昭示世人者。竟不如是。九一八來。美人對於日本在我東北之行動。僅能為紙上之抗議。英人則並此紙上之抗議而多　躊躇。豈非以日本地理上之優勢。已超過英美單獨海軍力所能制裁之限度。故九國公約與四國公約所規定之政治條文。不能不坐視其撕毁耶。由斯以言。華府海縮會議。雖有維持遠東和平之宏願。然其所訂五·五·三之比率。固已為一大失着。為今之計。正應懲前毖後。糾正舊失。使九國公約之精神。得存在於遠東。野心國無從施展其侵略之陰謀。而後始能無背海縮之本旨。否則何異於奬勵野心國之蠶食鯨吞。而加速世界之戰禍哉。</p>
<p>唯月餘以來。三國會談中存有遠東政治問題者。唯有美國。其所以主張維持華府舊約之比率。抑制日本海軍之再行增加。屢次表示。尚近乎是。英國態度。則頗為模稜。遂使日本態度益强。主張益堅。大有不達實質上之平等不止之勢。數日前英外相西門曾詢日人以遠東政治問題之態度。我人方以為英美有趨於恊調之勢。然自西門於日人拒談政治問題之後。宣示海縮尚有希望。意仍在委曲求全。以期談話之不致决裂。然由我人視之。捨政治問題而僅談軍艦與大砲。則縱使能抵於成。亦何補於國際之和平平。</p>
<p>且今次之海縮會議。苟欲其成。自非容許日人增高其海軍地位不可。既增加其海軍地位矣。則日人更可獨東亞。甚至關閉東亞之門户。亦無不可。一旦而至此。恐日人所予於英人之教訓。不僅一滿洲煤油專賣而已。故為英人計。此種模稜兩可之態度。實屬有害而無益。萬全之法。即在以政治問題為重心。以海縮為手段。與美國携手以謀世界真正之和平。誠能如是。則海縮之成功。即和平之保障成功也。</p>

<p>不啻對日一種變相的警告</p>
<p>格拉斯哥　樞密院長鮑爾温今日在此間演説遠東和平問題、暢論戰時運用英國遠東艦隊事、鮑爾温宣稱、「以英國而論、余在職一日、並在未明瞭美國態度以前、余决不准許以英國之海軍、應付任何地方之戰事」云、此言一岀、滿座感動如觸電、沈靜片刻後、全堂即掌聲雷動、目下英國正向美建議、倫敦海軍談話萬一因日本堅持平等而决裂、英美應合作以應付變局、鮑爾温今兹一言、實有兩重意義也、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］保守黨領袖掌璽大臣包爾温、昨晚在格拉斯哥保守黨會議發表演説、略謂［集體和平制度、其事雖佳、然就余個人意見、目前則斷難實行、蓋美國不幸尚未為國聯會之會員、而在最近兩三年來、德日兩大國又相繼脱離國聯會而去、苟此種事實存在、則集體和平制度、實無多大之價值、此等國家既不參加、則余敢斷言集體和平制度必無法進行、至於英國是否參加集體和平制度、當由政府加以决定、苟余在職一日、余必主張在未明美國態度之前、英國海軍决不能單獨對世界任何國家作武裝之封鎖、至美國能否放棄其傳統的孤立政策、固屬難言、然各大國如不能成為國聯會之會員國、則吾人無法使國聯會成為强有力之機關、如日德兩大國始終在國聯會之外、則國聯會必難行使其應有之職責、此則余所敢斷言者也、吾人今所當為者、乃在盡力工作、使以前曾隸國聯會之國家、重返國聯會、就余個人之信仰、以為此舉必可達到目的、余並相信必有一日、美國亦加此國際之集團、（廿四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國務總理赫爾今日表示熱烈贊成海軍談話中英美合作、赫爾之聲明係與各報記者談話時發表、各報記者曾以英國西門外相所稱海軍談話失敗結果、將使各國不利之事相詢、赫爾告記者稱、彼願將此項聲明作為正式宣言、並謂西門外相列舉海軍會談所遇之困難、言頗闓切、談判中之一綫光明、在於代表團之和好親密、而對於英國代表始終保持誠懇合作之態度、尤為欽佩云、此間外交界認此聲明、意在團結英美合作、以拒絶日本要求海軍平等、而赫爾所稱代表團友好密切一語、僅間接涉及日本代表團、惟於英國代表團則特别恭維、故此項聲明不啻明白答覆英國、表示英美不能接受日本要求時、美國樂於與英合作也、（二十三日國民電）</p>

<p>［東京］廣田外相鑑於海軍談話之形勢、共同廢棄華府條約之通告已不可能、故認為祗有單獨通告廢棄、今日上午外務省首腦部會議結果、已正式决定方針如下、</p>

<p>英實業會與郭公使來往函之公布</p>
<p>郭公使並向英國外交部提岀抗議</p>
<p>字林報十月三十日倫敦特别訪員通訊云、英國實業聯合會會長史考特勳爵、與中國駐英公使郭泰祺往來函件之公布、實含有辛辣性之暴露、並引起辛辣性之批評、</p>
<p>八月九日史考特勳爵函致郭使如下、「公使閣下、英國實業聯合會决議遣派一小團考察滿洲日本之商業狀况、閣下或已聞悉矣、兹特附上不日將登諸報章之通告一份、該團若能獲有游華之機會、良足為慰、惜該團所有之時間、此行不能岀此、惟鄙人殊望代表英國鋼鐵之畢高特君或能蒞華、以期討論與其實業有關之某種問題也」郭使覆函如下、「勳爵閣下、接奉八月九日來函、承告貴聯合會將派考察團赴滿、及將赴日、一致敬禮與好意、不勝感謝、並悉閣下希望該團團員代表鋼鐵業之畢高特君能蒞敝國、以期討論與其實業有關之某種問題、僕於此不得不為抱憾者、該團全體不能撥冗一遊敝國、蓋敝國縱暫失滿洲、而所有好意與市塲、實與遠東貴國實業家與製造家至有利益與價值、僕敢信閣下亦具同情焉、兹純就貿易立塲而言、而不涉及目前僞滿脱離中國所含明白的法律上與道德上之争議、中國市塲現所有已存在的、與潛藴的英國之投資、殊值得受貴聯合會之注意與景從也、敝國報紙聞貴團赴滿日之消息、殊為疑懼、僕接尊函後、扑以一己之疑懼奉告貴國外交部、不幸此種疑懼、已由敝國傳來之報紙消息徵明其信而有據、再、今古舍敝國不良之反響於不論、而事有須陳明者、在日本勢力雄長之地、除日人外、他國之貿易機會、誠渺乎其微、近兩年中滿洲之外國商行、連貴國者在内、紛紛被廹收歇、聲名卓著之英國公司、如開灤煤礦公司等、皆因日本之干涉與歧視、大受損失、八月十一日即上星期六日泰晤士報所載之大連特别通訊、大足表明因日人之故、此種事端曷為及如何不得倖免、在今日之僞滿中、開放門户政策、固為政治上之原則、而實際乃屬徒託空言、今已有文字為證矣、僕既為駐倫敦中國公使、保衛並增進敝國人民與貴國事業者間之良好諒解、一若盡力於敝國政府與僕受命岀使之政府間之良好諒解、當然為僕職責之一部分、僕故不得不爽直表示鄙懷、即以遠見而論、此團實難獲其所願得之效果是也、遠東貿易、須以真誠之合作獲得之、並分配之、此項合作、實含有許多因素、吾人同視中國之大市塲、不特為亞洲貿易的拱門之基石、且為拱門本身之大部分、僕於此節、毫無所疑、在此偉大的相互的事業中之實在的諒解與合作、而終使貴國之航業與商業同受其利、此實為英國與中國事業者與人民所當努力以求者、想閣下必以鄙見為然也、夫政治易受貿易之影響、而亦足影響貿易、若然、則中國固為亞洲貿易之中心點、而亦為亞洲政治之中心點也、」</p>
<p>史考特勳爵覆郭使函如下、「接本月十四日尊函、良用銘感、鄙人敢告閣下者、英國實業聯合會深知中英兩國間貿易之重要、且願以種種方法賡續往日之努力、鼓勵兩國人民間之友好的貿易關係、閣下必已知吾人對此方面所已取之數種步驟、尤其為吾人曾以種種便利給予中國貿學生、使得繼續其在敝國之事業研究、此種計畫、實由吾人發起、良以為幸、吾人對斯舉之結果、深為滿意、蓋已表明有種種希望可擴大其範圍、及成事業界相互接觸之有價值的途徑也、吾人殊望賡續努力、以維持與貴國至友好之貿易關係、鄙人敢為閣下保證者、凡聯合會於此方面力所能行之事、將極受鄙人為其會長者之歡迎、」聞郭使後又向英外交部提岀抗議、反對遣派此考察團赴滿、英外交部覆稱、外交部絶未與聞此舉、此純屬商業行逕、其行動毫不涉及政治問題云、關於此問題、雖未有所宣布、然聞郭使不能接受此種見解也、</p>
<p>考察團繼乃岀發、此已盡人皆知矣、本星期各報、皆載有考察團主任巴恩璧勳爵離東京前一夕所發之言論、日本經濟恊會會長、Eyoh男爵亦與同離東京而赴滿洲焉、巴氏之言論如下、「日本實業界與商界之代表領袖與英國實業考察團和諧討論之結果、於原則上商妥今宜在東京與倫敦設立日本經濟恊會與英國實業聯合會之委員會、以討論涉及兩國實業與商業之諸問題、以期獲一滿意之解决、又商妥應請日本經濟恊會與英國實業聯合會從連實行此種性質之計畫、以求有利於日英兩國間互益的貿易關係、」</p>
<p>每日導報倫敦訪員曾有紀載曰、「日人實欲在「滿洲國」獲銀行之放欵、此事之政治原因、甚至大於財政原因、塞里格曼爵士已公然通告日方、謂「英國負責方面之意見」（爵士此言大概指銀行界之意見）現贊成英日聯盟之復活、現議此項財政上之助力、先取銀行私人往來之方式、但稍遲此種放欵應加以鞏固、而在倫敦市上發行公共債劵、聞日方於此、願望尤切、蓋彼等以為獲得直接關心「滿洲國」之英國尋常投資者、在政治上可大有益於日人也、」</p>
<p>因塞里格曼爵士在東京曾發上述之言論、余（訪員自稱）故綴以每日導報星期五日所載之事聞一則、佘意當可視為甚正確也、</p>
<p>巴恩璧勳爵·塞里格曼爵士·及英國實業聯合會考察團中彼等之同志在東京之言行、使倫敦政界大為周章、考察團無官塲地位、無權討論英日間任何政治問題、已聲明在先、故雖以半半官性質岀之、亦不可能、但巴恩鐾璧勳爵於談述將不列顛與「滿洲國」聯成友誼之一練後、復稱、「英政府深知吾人之目的、曾予吾人以種種鼓勵、」固無怪東京視為「探試意見者」也、</p>

<p>賽嫁洪鈞時孟樸僅十三歳</p>
<p>孽海花之作為傳淸末掌故</p>
<p>賽在北平談話事實不正確</p>
<p>日前本報載北平通訊一則、記淸末名妓賽金花之印象及談話、文中涉及代賽轉名之孽海花、而賽金花則謂曾樸因情塲失則而作是書、是誠文壇一異常動聽之插話、所幸賽氏與曾樸先生均尚健在、真相如何、不難辨明、尤幸記者與曾樸先生有忘年交之誼、故於月明星稀寒風料峭的初冬之夜、驅車至上海福煦福煦××號投刺往謁焉、曾樸先生字孟樸、江蘇常熟人、壯年浮沉宦海、於政界頗多建樹、近年引退、休養園林、於故鄉常熟之虚霩園以藝花自娱、更於其暇翻譯法文豪囂俄名作、以樂晚年、每年秋冬之暇、來滬小駐、訪候舊友、兼以淸理瑣事、記者此次得以拜會先生、即乘先生小駐滬濱之便也、先生年已六十三、身體不甚康健、而精神矍鑠、議論風發、其熱情不亞於青年人、先生面龐瘦長、口髯下垂、衣藍粗布長袍、載白頂瓜皮小帽、履白鞋、以服老太夫人䘮也、記者與先生稍事寒暄後、即以申報通訊岀示、問先生對此事之批評與感想、先生笑曰、「此殆記者誤聽賽氏之言、不然則係有意揑造、以予揣度、賽氏决不能言予與之有愛情關係、因兩人間决無此事實也、今為解除外間誤解計、予姑略述予與賽氏之關係、及孽海花創作之動機、</p>
<p>（一）賽金花之生平及與予之關係</p>
<p>賽金花原籍鹽城、伊自稱蘇州、十六歳歸洪鈞鈞、洪字文卿、為吾父之義兄、同時又為余問師之師、故誼屬「太老師」、故余當時每稱賽金花為「小太師母」、賽嫁洪文卿時年十六歳、時予僅十三歳、焉解戀愛為何物、此非予信口亂説、現有文獻足徵、予手頭現有袁爽秋先生昶安般簃詩集、按了集即作於光緒丁亥、此集中在一送藜蒓齋觀察重使日本」之前、有詩題「送洪文卿閣學奉使俄德諸國」詩、即孽海花中所載「詔持龍節度西溟、又捧天書向北庭、」云云四律詩、文卿本與黎蒓齋·薛福成·等同年岀使、據此則文卿岀使的年份、確為丁亥、是年我正十六歳、而賽金花的歸文卿、在岀使前兩年、或三年、為光緒甲申或乙酉、樊山詩集「彩雲曲」稱、彩雲嫁文卿時為十六歳、那年余僅十三歳、即使再推下一年、至多十四歳、如何會有與賽認識且發生愛情的事、予初識賽於北京、時余任内閣中書、常岀入洪宅、故常相見、彼時賽豐度甚好、眼睛靈活、縱不説話、而眼目中傳岀像是一種説話的神氣、譬如同席吃飯、一桌有十人、賽可以用手、用眼、用口、使十人俱極愉快而滿意、換言之、伊决不冷落任何人、賽並非具洛神之姿的美人、惟面貌端正而已、為人落拓、不拘小節、見人極易相熟、予與賽識時、伊年約二十七八、着水脚繡花衣、梳當時流行之髯、已在隨洪岀使西歐歸來之後也、昶安般簃詩集癸集為癸巳年作、中有一題云、「葱嶺雪山間、界務未定、楊葜裳侍御宣治、奮然請行、戲作詩趣之、」所謂葱嶺雪山間界務、即因文卿中俄交界圖、發生了國界的問題、楊御史即揭參文卿的人、率使勘界、後來文卿的事、還仗他斡旋、然文卿不久即因此案鬱鬱致死、推算大約在是年秋冬間、因甲午洪眷南返、賽金花就在此時從船上脱逃、與洪家脱離關係、在上海掛牌子做生意、名曹夢蘭、蘇州士紳、因賽失蘇州人的面子、陸潤庠及其他士紳、廹之離滬、於是賽乃北走天津、又掛牌子名賽金花、賽於隨洪岀使德國時、與瓦德西將軍有染、故八國聯軍入北京時、瓦德西尋之賽應瓦德西之召到北京去仍掛牌子、日夜倍伴瓦德西、騎馬招摇過市、紅極一時、北京市民號之為「賽二爺」、瓦德西返德、賽因打死一丫頭、入刑部獄、同牢者有革命黨沈××、（上海蘇報案主角）有老官僚蘇元春、（法越之戰、彼在鎮南關親與其役、）號稱「三名獄」、後來由刑部發至蘇州·長洲·元和·吴縣·三堂會審、有人從中帮忙、乃得釋放、到上海再掛牌子、仍名賽金花、後嫁與津浦路小職員曹某、感情甚好、直至曹死、三度到上海掛牌子、在大舞台隔壁、仍名賽金花、遇國會議員魏某、與之結婚、時已五十歳左右、約在民國二三年之間也、余最後晤賽、即在此時、賽神氣尚好、惟塗粉甚厚、細看可見其皮已皺、喜着男裝、關於孽海花、賽曾提岀二點抗議、（一）不承認是轎夫的女兒、（二）不承認渡歐與船主發生關係、其他均未提及、賽確懂外國語、至少會説英·法·德·三國語、文字則不識、至説他不懂一句外國語、言之過大、試思賽與瓦德西前後有兩度密切關係、時日又非三天二日、焉有不懂一句德國語之理乎、</p>
<p>（二）孽海花創作之動機及過程</p>
<p>賽金花謂予因情塲失敗而作孽海花、予於上述談話中已指摘其謬、今再略述予著孽海花之動機、光緒三十年、余因病休養滬上、創小説林書局於上海、蘇州金一（字松岑）投來一稿、題名孽海花、計六回、余為之修改、且函商以賽金花為經、以淸末三十年朝野軼事為緯、編成一部長篇小説、金一復函謂無此魄力、乃全委之於予、故第一版的孽海花第一回尚係金一手筆、余作孽海花第一册既竟、岳父沈梅孫見之、因内容俱係先輩及友人軼事、恐予開罪親友、乃藏之不允岀版、但余因此乃余心血之結晶、不甘使之埋没、乃乘隙偷岀印行、時光緒三十二年也、「孽海花」人林琴南在「賊史」序上、揭明孽海花為曾樸所著、一時向余打交涉者甚多、至於孽海花之内容、誠如林琴南在「紅礁畫槳錄」序上所説、「孽海花非小説也、乃三十年之歷史也、」惟小説着筆時、雖不免有相當對象、然遽認為信史、斤斤相持、則太不瞭解文藝作品為何物矣、</p>

<h3 id="c195">「計劃」與「實現」 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 風萍</p>
<p>計劃是人人都有的，不過計劃有大有小，大的關於國家行政方面的進行；小的關於個人方面的事情，但是種種的計劃，未必一定實會現。</p>
<p>我家的小弟弟，現在他在小學校讀書，以前他每逢學期終了的時候，不論是暑假寒假，總定有一個計劃，關於假期裏自修的科目，並且做一張很嚴格的課程表，的確是個很完美的計劃，但是他的計劃，從没有實現過。</p>
<p>他失敗的原因是這樣的，因為考試後，對於精神上感到很疲勞，所以在假期的第一個星期，作為休息，但到第二星期時，他却換了一種口氣，「二個月的假期，何必如此急急呢！玩了幾天再進行，也未始不可」；然而光陰如箭的消逝了，在開學前的一星期，心裏覺到有些發急了，因此把各種功課的宿題！開快車的趕好它，不過久放的心，一時要收起來，實在是不可能的，所以他年年的計劃，没有實現過。</p>
<p>小朋友；恐怕你們也有這個弊病吧！</p>
<p>計劃不能實現的原因有二點：（一）計劃過大，辦起來，就感到有些辣手；（二）不立刻着手進行；要知道，計劃任可小些，但辦起來要用全副的精神去幹，結果總有實現的一天。</p>
<p>小朋友：天下没有辦不好的事，祗要努力去幹就是啦！小朋友！努力吧！努力！</p>
<h3 id="c196">達爾文 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 真</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們可認識這位大人物嗎？他是英國博物學家，是創造進化論的鼻祖。他生在公元一八○九年死在一八八二年，享壽七十三歳。他生平的事蹟，很可以做你們的模範。</p>
<p>他的身體很大，但是不十分强健，於是他一舉一動都有一定的規則：早上六時就起身，起身後必須洗冷水浴，然後在很靜的地方散步，讀書，早操，晚上八時就做他的工作。</p>
<p>他的讀書法，是很合乎科學的方法。每讀一本書，凡是書中有好的地方，就寫在這本書的末一頁，倘使是别人的書，那麽摘下它的要點。要研究某一科的學識，於是去檢查書的末一頁，把所收集的是有關係某一科的，造成一隻新表。所以他生平所得的事實，都可以一一檢查，没有遺漏的了。</p>
<p>他對於解剖，是不十分精密，並且又不會畫圖，可以研究的時候，比别人更費力，但是他自己，勉勵自己，最後到底有很好的效果。</p>
<p>他凡是讀一本書，必須想了好久，才能辨别這是對的，那是錯的。他的記憶力很强，雖然得到一些大約情形，然而他能够從這個大約情形，去研究從前所看見過的材料。</p>
<p>他正在研究討論的時候，一些也不固執本來的意見，雖然從前所得到的理論，已經能够解决所已經知道的事實；然為在研究所剩餘的時候，理論和新事實一不符合，於是立刻抛棄，一些也不可惜；再細細的研究，去求别的新理。</p>

<p>— 淡雲</p>
<p>兩塊磚頭，一同從窰裏燒了岀來，它們坐在一塊談着話，非常親密。</p>
<p>隔了兩天，這兩塊磚頭被裝上卡車，運送到一處正在造屋的地方。</p>
<p>屋造好了，一塊磚頭被砌在牆的最高的地方，一塊磚頭去被砌在牆脚邊，砌在上面的磚頭非常得意，常常嘲笑着下面的那一塊。</p>
<p>「現在，你是被壓服在我的下面，我在上面，是多少的光榮，開心啊！」它説。</p>
<p>「你不要得意，也許有更壞的厄運會降臨到你的身上的。」下面的那一塊磚頭勸告着它説。</p>
<p>「不會的，一定不會的。」</p>
<p>一天晚上，大風大雨，屋子塌倒了，上面的磚頭跌下來跌得粉碎，下面的磚頭却仍舊站在那裏，一些也没有動摇。</p>

<p>— 珠明</p>
<p>記得我在七八歳時候，到外祖家裏去，和許多表兄同鄰居的一班小朋友做濟油渣的游戲，用一條長凳，大家首先排坐着，喊聲一二三，就互相極力的推擠起來，如果那一端被擠下來人多的，就算失敗。我那時雖很幼穉，却也乖巧，以為在當中坐着，是不容易被擠岀來的，詎知自己力量太弱，没有抵抗能力，受了左右夾攻，擠得氣都吐不岀來，上了一個大當：後來我又覺得最好坐在凳的末端，决不致這樣受困，幸是坐的這端擠勝着，但並不是我的力量，不過因人成事，就勢推將過去罷了，凳端既讓有空位那端被擠的又連忙跑到這端來，我依然又夾到中間，與從前受困，一般無二；因此只好退岀，不敢再行參加。</p>
<p>現在回憶到這種游戲，真是一個好教訓，凡事總要自己有這種能力，纔可以制勝，若是圖僥倖，佔便宜，想依賴人家，不但是靠不住，反而自尋苦惱了。</p>
<p>人在社會上做事，都要自己有能力，纔能勝任，否則就同擠油渣一樣，是要受排擠的，小朋友，你要好好養成你的能力，為將來做事基礎，免得以後被擠吧！</p>

<p>— 希旦</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們瞧了這個標題時，覺得很奇怪，呌亞美利加幼童艦，説起牠的故事，十分使人欽佩；</p>
<p>這個故事的開始，是有一位在亞美利加的小學校當教師的，他有一天，領着許多學生到海邊去遊玩，忽然來了一隻軍艦，很快的在海上走，有一個活潑的孩子問：「這麽的一隻軍艦，做起來要多少錢呢？先生！」先生答：「一隻軍艦總要好幾十萬，但是你們如果把每天買糖果的錢和買玩具的錢儲蓄起來，也不難做成一隻軍艦！」於是從這天起，他們把所有買糖果和玩具的錢，都儲蓄起來，許多亞美利加的幼童都加入了。後來果然達到目的了。啊！這是多麽光榮的事啊？！</p>
<p>小朋友：我們希望將來也能够做一隻比亞美利加幼童艦更大的中國幼童軍艦，這事也不難的，祗要許多上海的幼童都把所有買糖果和玩具錢儲蓄起來，將來也會達到目的的，所以希望從今天起，快快去實行罷。</p>
<h3 id="c202">觸覺 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 鈍</p>
<p>我們身體上無論碰到什麽，都會起感覺作用，這種作用，就是觸覺。觸覺是一件奇怪的事情。觸覺神經在我們身體中，也是多少不同的。</p>
<p>身體各部分中觸覺最靈敏的是手指，唇，舌。假如我們着眼睛以後，要辨别一件東西的大小圓方，必須用手去摸，尤須用手指探索，才能分辨得確實，若把手掌攤開請人把一件東西放在掌心上（如圖一），那一定會錯誤的。如果用手指來摸，就可以分得淸淸楚楚。但手指的觸覺，有時也會不準確的，倘使你閉了眼睛，（如圖二）的按在一個小球上，你一定會覺得好像按着兩個球上了。</p>
<p>用肌肉的觸覺去什計物體的輕重。這試騐也是很奇妙的，你若（如圖三）的拿了兩件很重的東西，雖然這兩件東西的重量不同，但是我們很難得分辨那一件重，那一件輕。可是你和拿兩件輕微的東西，立刻會覺得那件較重，那件較輕了，背上的觸覺最鈍。（如圖四）的有兩隻手指觸在你背上，你一定祗覺得僅有一個手指的。</p>
<p>再用三盆温度不同的水來試騐觸覺，那便更有趣味了，你把一隻手放在熱水中，另一隻手放在冷水中，過一二分鐘以後，兩手同時去放在温水中，那剛在放在熱水中的手就會覺得水很冷，而剛才放在冷水中的手就會覺得很熱的。</p>
<p>小朋友，你覺得這很希奇嗎。難道觸覺也會變把戲的嗎？不是的，這是因為我們的皮膚因為得熱失熱的不同，所以皮膚的温度，也常常跟着有高低了。</p>
<p>1.觸覺判斷物體大小的辦别</p>
<p>2.一個小球但觸着的時候好像有兩個</p>
<p>3.觸覺來判斷重量</p>
<p>4.背的觸覺最鈍</p>
<p>5.用觸覺來實騐温度</p>
<h3 id="c203">寓言二則 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 琴孫</p>
<p>保護人</p>
<p>在一座山上有許多猴子，它們很平安的過着日子。但是，忽然不知從什麽地方來了一隻老虎，每天要吃去它們幾個同胞，以致猴子們漸漸的少了下去。整個猴族起了大恐慌，於是召集了全山的猴子開一個會，商量怎樣去對付老虎，保全自己的生命。大家想起了獅子比老虎厲害，於是去請了獅子來。果然，從此以後，老虎是不敢再來了。但是猴子們仍是一天天少下去，因為獅子代了老虎的地位而吃猴子了。這就是説：倚靠别人是没有用的。</p>
<p>蛇與蛙</p>
<p>一條蛇在路上看見七八隻的蛙在一處，它的肚子很餓，很想吃掉這些青蛙，但是它又怕許多青蛙聯合起來打它，所以只是在旁靜靜的等着，不一會忽然這些青蛙不知為什麽打起架來，而四散開來，趁這個好機會，蛇便過去一隻一隻的把它們全吃掉，看！雖然是弱小的東西，然而聯合在一起的時候竟會使一條蛇害怕，多厲害，聯合的力量！</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>小動物要睡眠了！天氣漸漸的冷了，草兒花兒都枯萎了，許多活潑潑地的小動物也不見了，世界真寂寞呀！這些小動物像青蛙，蜜蜂，蜴蟻，：：它們到底在甚麽地方呢？原來它們都睡眠了。它們因為熬不住寒冷；在外面又找不到食物，索性長長的睡它一覺。到了明年春風和暖萬物茁長的時候，才醒轉來做事，這便呌做「冬眠」。</p>
<p>松柏也凋。松柏一年四季葉兒青青，所以有「常青樹」的稱號；古人也有「松柏後凋」一語。許多小朋友都疑心松柏的葉兒是不會枯萎的。其實不然。它舊的葉兒未落下，新的葉兒已生岀。新陳代謝，所以終年不會有秃頂的當兒。</p>
<p>魚兒會凛死的嗎？到了十二月裏，水是這般的冷；有時河面上還結了一層厚厚的冰。許多小朋友一定會疑惑魚兒不穿衣服，不烤火罏，一定要凍死了。其實魚兒，這時藏身河底，也保持着相當的温度；未凍的水存着，他可吸取水中的養氣，所以决不會凍死的。倘使冰到河底，滴水無存，魚兒便僵了，這時它再也不能生存於世了。</p>

<p>科學先生是一個態度慈祥的老頭兒，今天要在幾千個小朋友的面前變戲法，他一上台，就拿了一隻燭盤，放在一隻小方桌上，把蠟燭點着了，又從襪袋内取岀一隻馬口鐵製的小喇叭。</p>
<p>「諸位，有誰能够用這喇只把蠟燭吹熄？」</p>
<p>幾千隻小手同時舉起來，齊聲嚷道：我會……我會……這容易……」</p>
<p>科學先生指着台前第一排的一個女孩子，呌她上去。</p>
<p>這位小朋友上去了，她拿起了小喇叭，照她平常吹喇叭的方法，把喇叭口朝着蠟燭，把管子啣在嘴唇裏，她用力一吹，可是奇怪，那蠟燭火熖不但不熄，反而向着喇叭口這方面飄過來，（請看第一圖）於是台下閧起了一陣笑聲。</p>
<p>第一圖　白費氣力</p>
<p>科學先生説：「她這樣吹法是吹不滅蠟燭的。當她吹的時候，空氣從管子裏岀來，沿着馬口鐵的平滑的斜面，岀了喇叭口。分散在蠟燭的周圍；同時，在外面的空氣却立即向喇叭口湧過來，去填滿那喇叭口中間没有空氣的地方。外面空氣湧過去的時候，火熖也被帶着向喇叭口飄過去了，現在你把喇叭倒過來吹，就可以把蠟燭吹熄了。」</p>
<p>那位小朋友照他的話，把喇叭口對着自己的嘴，把管子對凖了蠟燭火熖，一吹，果然就熄了，（請看第二圖）</p>
<p>科學先生説道：「她這樣吹法，空氣從喇叭去裏進口，就集中了，從管子裏岀來，火熖受着了這一股氣，還會不熄麽？」</p>
<p>第二圖　換一方法</p>
<p>科學先生又去拿岀一隻碟子和一隻燈泡來。碟子裏面放了一點水，把剛才熄了的蠟燭重新點着，竪在碟子裏面，再把燈泡罩住了蠟燭。没有多久，蠟燭火熖漸漸地陰暗了，結果是完全熄滅了。</p>
<p>「你們懂得這是什麽道理麽？」科學先生問道：「空氣裏面含有一種養氣，牠是燃燒時候少不了的東西，因為有燈泡罩住了蠟燭，裏面的養氣不久就用完，因此火熖就不得不熄滅。但是我有法子使火熖不熄滅，」</p>
<p>他一邊説，一邊拿起了一張厚紙版，用剪刀剪成字形。又把燈泡内的蠟燭重新點着。蠟燭不久就陰暗下去了，快要熄滅的當兒，他把Ｔ字形厚紙版放在燈泡的中央，兩邊距離一樣，哈哈！那火熖又亮起來了！</p>
<p>第三圖　重見光明</p>
<p>科學先生説「你們看：這燈泡因為放上了厚紙版，便分成兩部份了。熱了的用過的空氣從一邊岀去，冷的新鮮的空氣，從另一邊源源不斷地進來，所以又燃燒着了。</p>
<p>「怎麽曉得一邊空氣進去，一邊空氣岀來呢？我們也變一套戲法來證明，」他説完，拿起了兩根小紙吹，劃一枝自來火點着了，把牠們放在Ｔ字形紙版旁邊，一邊一根。這時一個紙吹的火頭向下，還有一根却向上。」</p>
<p>「這一根紙吹的火頭向下，證明空氣從外面進去，這一根紙吹的火頭向上，證明空氣從裏面岀來。」</p>
<p>台下起了一陣拍掌聲。幕就閉了。（第一幕完）</p>

<h3 id="c209">男女平等之名義與實際 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 張志敏</p>
<p>自從立法院通過刑法二三九條：現定：有夫之婦與人通姦者處一年以下之有期徒刑其相姦者亦同；但對於有婦之夫與人通姦，則無科罪之規定，在法律上有違男女平等之原則，以致引起京滬各地婦女界之激烈的抗争。這確是一種好的現象。關於這問題，記得法學博士王寵惠先生有一段談話：「有夫之婦與人通姦者科罪，而有婦之夫與人通姦者則否，此固根據生理學上之理由，各國百年前之舊法律，莫不如是，即迄今亦有三四國仍奉行，我國亦其一也」。</p>
<p>王博士是法學專家，所談當有桹據。按照他的説法通姦科罪在歷史上向來是專為對待婦女而設的，并且是根據生理學上的理由，（可惜王博士未及將此生理學上的理由，加以具體的開導）。但他又説：「根據歷史的事實，近百年來這種男女不平等待遇的法律，已在世界各文明國中漸漸减少了」，這又是什麽理由呢？</p>
<p>這種理由説來話長，不是在此地所能根本研討的：簡言之，就是因為在個人的經濟單位之下，婦女在經濟上又没有獨立的地位，便退守於家庭中成為男子的附屬品（俗稱眷屬不是無理由的），男子的家庭奴隸。在這樣的情形之下，女子便成為男子之禁臠，對男子有守貞操之絶對義務，與人私通便表示奴隸對於主人之不忠心，當然要受嚴厲的懲罰，以安定家庭的秩序（美其名曰家庭幸福），通姦科罪的刑罪，就是由此而來。</p>
<p>至於男子，乃是一家之主，對一切財産及眷屬，有自由處置之權，他為表示他的豪富與狂蕩，不僅可以納妾蓄婢，并且還可以尋花問柳。社會上對他這種行為，不但不視為不當，而且還仰慕不已。</p>
<p>近百年來，因機器工業與分工的發達，機器有使用女子之可能，及家庭簡單化等原因，女子便得有獨立謀生之機會，并稍稍從家庭奴役中脱離岀來。婦女解放的呼聲，便由此而起。同時在近代個人自由競争經濟中，即在家庭範圍内，男子也不需要贅累的家庭奴隸，而需要能自覺負責的「賢内助」。此所以對婦女通姦科罪的刑法，在各工業國中便漸漸取消了。</p>
<p>站在近代的觀點上，兩性的關係完全建立在自由的志願上。有結婚的自由與離婚的自由，根本打破了貞操的觀念；因經濟的發展與由此而來的男女社交公開，這種貞操觀念已無法維持了。但事實又已證明兩性的固定關係，即一夫一妻之家庭制度，并不因此而完全不能成立。這就是因為撇開貞操的道德，還有夫妻的共同生活之必須，兩性同居之必須及有意識的意志做了維持的基礎。</p>
<p>本着上述的見地，要求廢除對於女子通姦科罪的法律，實是消滅歷史上野蠻的遺跡，解除婦女一層壓廹之光明正大的主張。但是觀於目前京滬各婦女團體代表之請願運動，似乎并不圖從根本上要解除婦女的壓廹，他們本心上尚認為有用刑罰制裁婦女通姦之必要，但又覺得這種單方面的規定有傷紳士派婦女的體面，於是便花樣翻新，將婦女所受的「惡待」仍舊保留，而以報復的形式加男子以同樣的「惡待」。這樣的平等實是表示夫婦間的人格互不尊重，未免不甚澈底。</p>
<p>我要申明：我并非提倡通姦者。通姦的事非法律所能禁止，亦非人所能提倡，一般的説起來，通姦事之流行乃由於經濟的原因男女間性的生活之缺乏與不圓滿所致，（如因生計問題許多青年男女不能結婚，貪圖財勢之不適當的配偶，富豪之家之過剩的姬妾，夫婦間不和，限於生計及兒女的拖累不能離婚甚至有貧婦為藉私通而獲無形之收入并經丈夫之同意者……等）。凡已正式成立之夫婦無不知從共同生活之需要上及教育兒女上節制淫蕩，力圖保持夫婦間之和睦和家庭生活之安定。這一層在一般平民中，即在紳士派認為「下層無知婦女」中，尤知如此。這是要請求現在婦女解放的「先覺者」們放寛心的。</p>
<p>現代的婦女即在各工業國中亦尚只取得法律上名義的平等，離實際的平等尚相差甚遠。在現在的經濟制度中，婦女雖稍有謀生之機遇，但其職業的機會究比男子為少，勞動婦女更以弱者的資格受機器之特别壓榨，結婚後女子究因家庭的服務及生育兒女之拖累仍墮落為家庭的奴隸或半奴隸的地位。在此種實際的不平等的狀况之下，熱心的婦女運動者若不從此等實際不平等狀况中力争改善婦女的地位，并要求法律予婦女以特别的保護，甚至於否認或掩飾這種實際的不平等徒争面子上之法律平等，其結果吃虧的還是在婦女這一方面。强者和弱者在維持現狀之下訂立平等條約，就是保持弱者之劣等的地位。</p>
<p>即就通姦一事而論，女子在現時所處的環境中通姦的便利究較男子為少而且難；男子挾其經濟上及社會上之優越地位，其通姦究能多得婦方之「容忍」，女子這一方面便恐難於效尤！且數十年之風俗習慣，視男子之通姦為「不算什麽」，女子則為大逆不道，或莫大的恥辱！如此種種實際情形，恐决非半條法律規定男女通姦同科罪之平等所可抹殺的罷！</p>
<h3 id="c210">争法及其他 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 斐</p>
<p>這次婦女團體争法運動，可以看見國人各樣不同型的意識。關於二三九條，據説二萬萬男子，將有三萬萬犯罪，所以不能科刑。只專科女的。理由呢，不用説，女子是從屬，是私有物，必須貞操。經過一争，名法學家更提心弔膽的宣揚着説：實在不能科刑男子。因為咱們貴國男子娶妾的有百分之三十，將都要變成犯人。至少，以後也不便討小老婆了。可是，這條總算交把立法院複議了。然而事前某部長深怕「修正原案」重提，弄得老爺們欲縱慾兮畏刑，便鈎心鬥角的提岀這麽一個意見：主將該條改為「有婦之夫與人通姦而破壞其家庭者處罰。」換句話就是：男子儘可犯姦，只須技術巧妙化。不閙亂子便得。例如，陳倉暗度，不公然霸佔人妻人女之類，那就算是合法行為了。這些名言高見，完全反映岀男權社會裏宗法，封建，和資本主義的殘餘意識。其煞費心血，無非在求條文上能説得過去，而不妨碍中上社會男子們淫逸縱慾的浪行，因為事實告訴我們：一般中下的户口，都在貧困饑寒綫上挣扎，誰還有餘力餘錢餘餘閑去作通姦討小老婆這些怪呢！</p>
<p>其次，是義憤填胸的争法的婦女團體之羣。他們反對二三九條之不平等，原則自然是對的，但是請願要求男女同等處刑，試問這究竟與兩性間幸福何補？查民法第一○五二條：「夫妻之一方，以他方有左列情形之一者為限，得向法院請求離婚。」在其左列十項規定之二，即為「與人通姦者」。而現行「刑事訴訟法」，為維持家庭的恊和，又限制夫妻間的互控。即此次修正的新刑法，在二四五條上對於二三九條的罪，也是規定「須告訴乃論」。假定複議結果，是男女同刑。若按照訴訟程序，凡訟夫犯姦者，第一步是先向法院請求離婚，離過婚後，才能再告他的通姦罪。即使盡法辦罪，而女方獲得的究竟是什麽呢？我們要曉得現行刑法第二五六條之單科「有夫之婦」與人通姦的罪刑，完全是站在維持家庭這觀點上為男權着想的。這種條文，在男女平等的社會裏固然没有；就是在歐美資本主義較進步的國家，也没有了。現在我們婦女團體還苦苦地要求男女同科，不知究為何來？若説不以法律範圍，則男子將更肆無忌憚。那麽，民法第一○五六—五七兩條，本來可資救濟。如再怕男子利用經濟作惡，則不妨將這兩條關於賠償或贍養費加重明白規定。使其負擔不勝，知所顧慮。也許能使他們安分一點的：這豈不較為實際些嗎？</p>
<p>還有另外一種主張，　　　貞操，乃封建的殘餘意識，應該除去。而法律空文，並無補於男女真正的平等。刑法二三九條自然要不得，存與廢值不得注意。根本應在經濟構構求改進，有了好的社會，兩性間才能得着同樣的幸福。這是頗堪深切思考的，（請參看大晚報第六期婦女專號。）</p>
<p>我以為在今日中國社會，婦女界既有人的地位之覺醒，就應該力求人的表現。由於這次争法波動，可知「相沿下來的婚姻制度與家庭組織，到了目前思想演進，萬流冲激的時代，根本已發生了動摇。」（十七日大晚社論）那麽，事實的教訓：回到家庭此路已經不通了。賢母良妻的思想，應付不了現代的人生了。只有學習作人的學識技能，去艱苦英勇地争取男女平等的人的地位！</p>
<p>至於新刑法二二一條，其受害者大都中産以下户口。然引起社會注意之程度，絶不如二三九條。這也可見法律保障人權之慣性，和社會的一般地意識，可是天災人禍，已弄到農材普遍地破産，市民一般地窮困，賣女為家長所享有的親權人肉市塲，不知有多少未滿十四歳的少女毁滅在金錢和獸慾之下！縱即争得恢復現行刑法原文（仍改為十六歳），又與事實何補？熱心婦運諸君，請再努力！</p>
<h3 id="c211">參觀某女校記 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 茜</p>
<p>這一天，是某女校開懇親會的日子，雖然天上下着牛毛細雨，地下又泥泥滑滑，我仍滿高興地夾着我那把晴雨兼用的藍布破傘，跟在房東太太後面（她的小姐現住該校），向某校岀發了。好容易換上兩次車，走了一叚丁丁拐拐的石子路，方到達目的地，。一踏進那矮小的側們，展眼一望，我便覺天地大大兩樣，與鄰近狹隘汚濁的世界相反，學校内是聳立着高大的西式洋房，展開着緑草如茵的操塲。因要找尋房東的小姐，我們便沿道一路參觀起走。幼稚園部，小學部，厨房，飯廳，洗浴室，健身所，都看過了，房子的建築與設備，委實不錯，尤其鋼琴室多至二十餘間，幾令人疑心誤走入音樂院了。</p>
<p>最後，我們走進了中學部，也就是這天招待家長的地方。在這兒，第一惹我眼睛的，便是黄髮梳得光而且直，年在三十開外的兩個外國女人。她們站在門口那「歡迎家長」的横匾之下，嘻開着紅紅的嘴唇，不斷地向着來賓點頭點腦地在招待。</p>
<p>正對着大門的走廊壁上，像靈位又像祖宗牌似的巍巍然供着兩塊一尺見方的玻璃像架，逼近一看，方知像架内嵌的，是教育局褒奬該女校會考及格人數，超過他校的褒奬狀。一見之下，我立時連想起了南京路浙江路口幾家掛燈結綵的賣彩票的店子。這些店子的老闆，在店門口櫃檯上供的那個搭着紅的金財福之上，不是用紅紙大書着「上次×奬在此，」以作確憑實據的招徠廣告嗎？某女校所供的這兩塊褒奬狀，其用心大概與彩票店老闆的不會兩樣罷。聽房東太太説，自從有了這兩塊褒奬狀，學生忽然增多，這學期已有六七百人，而且一般人已將它目為模範女校了。</p>
<p>我的原意，本只預備觀察觀察這洋學堂内的洋化和麻醉工夫做得與我十年前所身受的，有否兩樣的。可是現在這麽一來，使我對於它的學科和思想方面，倒非更加注意不可。抱着這種决心，一找着房東的小姐，我便邀着她們順便走入了初中二的教室。我先翻她們頂括括的功課，英文的練習簿，但除了三四十個生字外，别無長物。隨即我遂拿起了一本中文作文簿，五六篇作文中，有一篇的題目是「朝會」。當我正讀到</p>
<p>「上週朝會時，有盲啞學校的學生來唱讚美詩，本星期朝會中有福兒所的學生來唱讚美詩」時，房東的小姐忽然大發雷霆，將她母親狠命向教室門外拖，我抬起頭來定睛一望，方發覺靠近教室的門口，有三四個臉上擦得紅紅白白的少女正和房東小姐在嘰嘰咕咕吵着嘴，意思是説她（房東小姐），一個小學部的學生，怎敢將來賓引到她們中學部來參觀。我既明白了個中真情，遂大踏步走岀了該教室。</p>
<p>上得樓來，我又不知趣地走進了高中二的教室。這一次，我便先翻作文簿了，在好幾篇作文中，一篇「女水治内論」特别引起了我的興趣，又凑巧上手的第一本上，便有以下的兩段妙文：</p>
<p>「娜拉岀趁，轟動一時，然已失世人之同情心矣。夫一娜拉岀走，已失世人之同情心，千萬娜拉岀走，其必為天下人所咒罵侮辱，蓋不免矣。」</p>
<p>「家庭乃良好國民之製造所，家無賢母，國焉得有良民？……」</p>
<p>我為好奇心所使，也顧不了房東太太小姐的催促，又繼續翻閲了好幾本作文簿，雖均無特别立論之處，然而大家却有一共通之點，即在引論而又不十分滿意希特拉的新婦女政策之後，而自下結論曰：</p>
<p>「夫已入家庭者，可以不必再岀，未入家庭者，可使之服務社會……」</p>
<p>此中真意，大概是指已結婚的女子，應該安分守己好好在家做一個賢妻良母，未結婚的女子，不妨在外替人做做花瓶。</p>
<p>在三樓大講堂内，在許多臉上擦得紅紅白白，頭髮燙得蓬蓬的摩登少姐（學生）之中，我們足足坐了四小時，還只看了遊藝會的一半。遊藝會之前，是校長致開會辭。該校有男女兩部，校長是姊弟倆按性别分着担任的。這一天雖是女校舉行懇親會，可是那個四十開外的年紀，擦胭抹脂，燙得蓬蓬的頭髮，穿得花花緑緑的衣裳，頸上吊着長長的水紅項鍊，腕上套着鐲頭的女校長，我們只看見她妞妞妮妮。跑來跑去，演説以及主持會務一切，全是乃弟代庖。代庖先生的演説很短，大意是，這一次開懇親會的目的，是在聯合家庭學校一氣舉行新生活運動！</p>
<p>遊藝會的節目多至二十種，有的表演得很好，不過太過於洋化，例如五六歳的幼稚園學生，表演「我看你」的表情唱歌時，依然是照西方搬來時的那種原樣，幾張小嘴不斷地唱着I　see　you或You　see　me我後面來的一些女賓，雖是一面看見那些天真爛漫的表情，笑得眼淚都流岀來了，一面只得遺憾千萬地自言自語着：「真好玩，可惜不懂她們嘴裏唱些什麽，」又如一個英文演講的，雖然演説辭順背如流，然台下的人聽了只説是像鳥呌。此外，我還看了「孟母教子」的歷史表演。綜合這一切，與我十年前在一教會女學所受的教育，絲毫没有兩樣。</p>
<p>我在失望之餘，遊藝會的節目雖只演了一半，天已全黑下來，我只得就那麽告别了。快走岀會塲時，我在幾張坐位後的插書筒内，發見了五六本「頌主聖歌」，詢之於房東小姐，據説每晨以及星期日，她們是必須作禱告的。下得樓來，在燈光之下，我在校長室外的佈告箱内，看見了下列的一條佈告：</p>
<p>「本校為謀學生三育平均發達起見，每生每學期對於體育，智育，宗教，社會服務，必須有相當成績……」</p>
<p>岀走校門，兩脚重踏上那泥滑丁拐的石子路，我不覺合了十，向後唸了一聲「善哉，模範女學！」</p>

<h3 id="c213">「女兒經」的新「從夫」主義 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 蔡慕暉</p>
<p>「女兒經」的主編者，從他的佈局方法看來，頗有在該劇本中包羅一切婦女問題的企圖祗不知道為了什麽，他所描寫的八九位女主角的生活，都逃不岀兩性關係的播弄，她們的命運，全受着性關係支配。難道女人的能力永遠會像孫行者那麽渺小，兩性關係的神通，却好像如來佛祖那麽廣大，孫行者無論翻幾多觔斗，總翻不岀佛祖的手掌心嗎？</p>
<p>記得二十年前，祖母常常用着感嘆的口吻説：女人的命運好像落花，落在淸澄的金魚池裏就萬分幸福，落在臭汚的露天糞缸裏就一世倒楣；而落好落壞，却全不由女人自主，月下老人愛怎麽安排就怎麽安排。我那時候已「馬馬虎虎」有幾分反抗舊禮教的意識，就對祖母説：我一定不做落花，却要像蝴蝶一樣自由自在飛到東飛到西。祖母因此引經據典地把同鄉婦女的往事一件件講給我聽，又談到了四位姑母的種種不幸，想説服我。可惜説着説着，祖母的喉管就像突然患了傷風症似的不大發得岀聲音，眼淚亦像斷了綫的唸佛珠一樣一顆顆落到了衣襟上。</p>
<p>祖母的話是未可厚非的。在他的時代，女人還都没有公認的社會地位，她們除非膽敢扮演「馬前潑水」的女主角，就祗好聽天由命地嫁雞隨雞嫁狗隨狗。他們是没有法子獨自創造自己的命運的。但到了現在，和男人一樣絞着自己的腦汁，流着自己的血汗，在工業界，商業界，文化界挣扎奮鬥的女子人數已經不少，她們都是能够自己把握命運，不肯像落花一樣的前途，但也祗是相互的相對的影響罷了，也不是設有貢獻的。祗可惜女兒經的編者，僅僅描寫一個言行絶對矛盾，甘心做男人留聲機的假女權運動者，和一個受盡異性威廹利誘的女店員；除此之外，就没有提起任何不受性關係所左右的過着職業生活的女子。這是一本在一九三四年編演的電影，不知怎樣會代表着去世已久的我的祖母的人生觀？提倡「新從夫主義」？</p>
<p>喔，我想起來了，當我還只九歳的時候，因為我不肯安坐在家裏祖母曾勉强我讀一本女兒經，在那本書裏，有着許許多多不堪入耳的教訓。這位一九三四年的「女兒經」的編者，也許是想負起他的使命來教訓不肯遵從舊禮教的女人罷？祗可惜現在的新女兒，已有着事實領導她們看見兩性以外的世界，不再肯聽信「從夫」主義了，即使是花樣兒很新鮮的，「新從夫主義」。</p>
<p>那部我們的祖母時代，婦女母親人人必聽的女兒經，現在不是已經無形消滅了嗎？我想這一部換湯不換藥的新「女兒經」不會有人相信它的教訓的罷？</p>
<h3 id="c214">隨筆 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 水音</p>
<p>一都份的婦女，似乎願意永久給人家看看而已，並不想抬頭挣一點社會地位，總是裝扮得花花緑緑，這是從事婦運的先進婦女所應引為奇恥的。</p>
<p>從事婦運的先進婦女們，不應該只着眼在婦女知識階級身上，而應放大眼光，看到社會的另一角去，工廠婦女，農村婦女，以及小市民階層上去。</p>
<p>面紅和口紅，似乎並不十分好，最好能勿用；從前的撲得白，現在的塗得紅，紅白真是一樣的。</p>
<p>婦女的争取社會地位，我可肯定地説：「决不在外表上，而是在肚子裏，」試問，無學問，無才幹的，能够幹什麽呢？就是有機會，也是没有辦法幹得下。</p>
<p>最適合婦女胃口的職業，是小學教員，在美國，小學教員，女性佔百分之八以上；但是中國的摩登女子並不想做小學教員，而且好似最討厭這一門職業，以為是不足道，那是錯了。</p>
<p>中國的婦女，還没有挣得一點兒社會地位，女性的社會人，還是很難找見，關於婦女的刋物，也没有幾個肯説話，肯幹事的女性，也不多；這是從事婦運的人們，所應引以為憂的。</p>
<p>想岀一個辦法來，怎樣方使婦女不躱進家庭去。</p>

<p>銀根微現鬆動</p>
<p>—拆劃均已回小—</p>
<p>昨日洋市形勢已微現鬆動、不似日前之堅急、人心亦略鎮定、蓋匯豐風潮尚未平息、輸岀現銀已受打擊、致市况漸現鬆動、市塲中洋拆、亦因而跌小二分、早午市均做二角三分、而劃頭加水則為一角二分、亦較前日改小二分、拆票交易、早市轉賬三百四十餘萬、新交易八十餘萬、午市交易二十餘萬、小總會中交易五十餘萬、洋押欵交易取贖八十餘萬、新做一百二十餘萬、銀行收解、外商銀行收解票欵二百五十餘萬、各種貨匯押墊雜欵收解四百九十餘萬、電匯欵一百二十餘萬、外匯結欵八十餘萬、特種匯欵七十餘萬、進倉九十萬、華商銀行收解票欵三百三十餘萬、各種貨匯押墊雜欵收解四百二十餘萬、電匯欵九十餘萬、外匯結欵七十餘萬、關税欵九十餘萬、特種匯欵六十餘萬、進倉六十萬、日商銀行收解票欵二百六十餘萬、各種貨匯押墊雜欵收欵五百二十餘萬、岀倉四十萬、錢莊洋公單收解四千二百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解五百四十餘萬、各路匯欵六十餘萬、鈔票收回六十餘萬、發岀一百五十餘萬、解現一百十餘萬、客路來滬二十萬、去胃九十萬、又本市票據交換所二十四日交換總數、銀元一千零九十萬零七千二百零六元七角五分、内計銀元五百萬零零七千二百七十一元五角三分、匯劃銀元五百八十九萬九千九百三十五元二角二分、</p>
<p>現洋運香港轉赴國外</p>
<p>白銀輸岀、因受海關規定之影響、屢次變更轉口地、首以海關增税、分運南華各地、然後岀國、今則因財部令海關規定、國内現銀流通、須領護照事、販銀者又復困難、今聞運銷國外之白銀、除完納税餉外、尚有利可圖、故最近三日中、又有現洋一百二十餘萬、運往香港、再轉岀口云、</p>

<p>金潮高騰聲中紗花漲風愈熾</p>
<p>紗市趨堅、漲風劇烈、因金價發現新高峯、某外國銀行發生謡風、同時多頭公司在本月份把持收貨、因此漲勢異常濃烈、原棉亦告大漲、但本月份為最後一日、最後一盤市氣平平、為一百八十二元、比十月期漲四元三角、</p>
<p>遠月紗漲一元半左右　標紗前市開盤、因人氣仍緊、而金價步漲、致多頭意態愈挺、買户踴躍、各月均漲三·七·八·九角至一元、午後一般空頭、均現恐慌、抵補者甚衆、但本月份平平、遠月漲四·七·八角、全日成交統計七萬一千二百包、查賣岀穗隆一千一百五十包、源大六百包、　昌一千九百包、昶記九百包、均昶三千九百包、慎德二千九百五十包、泰昌三千四百五十包、長豐五千四百五十包、達記九百包、廣豐三千八百包、買進通記二千五百五十包、梅記七百五十包、恒益六百包、大豐三千九百包、明德一千一百五十包、慎記一千二百包、潤康七千八百包、大昶七百五十包、崇安一千四百五十包、元一一千零五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>實銷一千二百餘包　現紗銷路尚佳、查全日各帮買去統計一千二百二十五包、行情漲五角、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>棉市續堅、漲風益熾、因金價最高曾達一千零二十元以外、致買方大為活動、同時棉紗市况趨漲、棉市愈見挺硬、本月份為最後一日、市盤較紗市為昂、末盤為三十六元五角、比十月期價漲一元四角、</p>
<p>本月最後日大跳　標棉前市開盤、外棉雖平、匯兑步縮、金價狂漲、發現新高峯、拍至三收盤、市價大漲、買户頗衆、各月漲二·三·四角、午後開盤市况仍挺、本月價漲五角、惟遠月大孚號大批賣岀了結、市價壓小、跌一角半、全日成交統計二十四萬二千五百担、查賣岀仁豐二千担、錦昌一千七百担、大孚二萬一千三百担、源大四千担、合興二千四百担、慎昌二千一百担、元德二千四百担、恒德三千四百担、泰昌七千九百担、永昌四千七百担、信誠二千一百担、賡豐二千六百担、均昶五千一百担、買進長餘三千担、福大四千三百担、恒益三千二百担、大豐一萬一千三百担、明德三千担、同豐三千二百担、慎記三千一百擔、仁豐四千五百擔、益康四千一百擔、長和七千二百擔、潤康三千三百擔、大昶三千擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>洋麥有加税之説粉麥市突見暴漲</p>
<p>粉昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼高　　、以洋麥報價、芝加哥祗四分之相互岀入、坎拿大跌二角左右、故開價時、人心初尚平定、旋因業内外之觀察、以為前日豆油受關税增加而高漲、恐洋麥之進口税、亦連帶增加、兼之金價連漲、人心皇皇、市塲買户、突呈活躍、市面亦步見升提、較前日計好二分左右、迨至下午開盤、各月份市况、又呈飛黄騰達之象、因市塲謡傳、洋麥加税、有實行之説、因此空頭争補、多頭又紛紛收買、致市面突呈暴漲之恐怖、惟實銷並不暢動、國内又值兇歳、麵粉亦關民食、或者傳説未盡可信也、結果本月份漲七分二釐半、十二月份一月份漲六分半、二月份漲七分、三月份漲八分、四月份漲七分云、</p>
<p>麥昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份尚呈平穩之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥互有四分之上落、坎拿大小二角左右、當開價時、本月份因交割已近、雙方授受不暢、價少岀入、遠期則交易仍淡、惟抛户甚稀、買户則頗活動、因此開價較好三四分不等、迨至下午開盤、因上午粉市良好、且傳洋麥有加税之説、故一時買氣暢活、市面遂繼漲增高、寂寞已久之市面、不料有此謡傳、竟突破沉悶之局也、結果本月份漲九分、十二月份漲八分、一月份漲一角一分、二月份漲一角一分、三月份漲一角三分、現麥市面、已呈俏利、惟各廠又擯、故開而未配、聞山東麥喊三元八角五分、次八角二分云、</p>
<p>芝加哥麥市因法國小麥進口事尚未證實、但有在此間套賣之可能、故有相當之影響、據謡言謂玉蜀黍續有進口定貨、又謂政府對雜糧之漲價、不以為然、市塲盛傳、下届國會議員中、已成立一有力之通貨膨脹集團、此事漸引人注意、</p>
<p>期豆油繼續升漲</p>
<p>—兩日内漲一元以上…足補税銀—</p>
<p>豆油為加税實行勢難變更、故昨日交易所油價續漲、十一月漲三角、十二月一月各漲三角五分、二月漲三角、三月漲四角、四月漲二角五分、兩日所漲、已在一元以上、大約新增之税、業已包括於市價内、故各月期豆油、均已岀十二元以上、遠期（四月）最高已達十二元九角五分、現貨昨日售開亦為十二元二三角、</p>
<p>河米銷呆再降兩角</p>
<p>（滬南）各帮來源三十來號、（貨共四千七八百石）本街銷塲、天雨更滯、售方喊聲因復繼低、客帮岀手進取近千來包、且都限價奇嚴、全無放寛之意、青島威海衛等帮先後得購此數、市色仍無轉機希望、計結果各色晚稻價仍再降落一二角、厚粳續疲角餘不等、杜洋尖亦跌尺外、陰元以去路轉滯、竟貶二三角、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各帮到船念一二號、市銷方面、白粳蓮稻羊杜尖殺價稍化、新白元陰元仍呆、酒户不動、破粳客尖平淡、市形白粳小一二角、薄稻羊杜尖價小角外、新白元小二角、客尖破更價形疲象、</p>
<p>洋客秈午後激漲角許</p>
<p>九江帮問津期洋米</p>
<p>昨日洋米上午本客均淡、而洋行抛售仍健、市初平平、繼因九江帮收羅期洋米、本街内地亦活、期米立大四五分、成交四月份一千噸、三月·十二月各五百噸、三四月均大至五元一角二分、現洋米亦復帶起一角、一號西貢大至十一元二角、共開西貢及暹邏元米機米共計二千多包、</p>
<p>客秈邇日到存兩多、昨日又有到埠、故午前雖有内地本街問津、市乃平站而已、午後洋米激漲後、客秈亦為帶起近角矣、而本街内地之進胃更貧、共計開岀湘米五千包、漢口沙市各米一千四百三十一包云、</p>

<p>五金市面、就過去十餘日中情形觀之、依然毫無進步、非但物價未見提高、而實交方面、反見遜色、然銀拆高至二角四五分、其銀根之緊廹、益為鮮明之事實、買賣前途、欲其振展、殊為不易之事、兹將其主要者市况分誌於后、</p>
<p>（會訲鐵供趨於求）二百磅會司鐵、客帮生意已成强弩之末、未見若何起色、而本街交易、除零星尚覺熱閙外、大宗買賣亦寥寥無幾、行情老鋼廠開二十九元五角、新鋼鐵二十九元、野鷄貨二十八元五角、聞開岀祗有百餘箱、</p>
<p>（馬口鐵市售倒懸）馬口鐵近因外匯趨緊、蝕本浩大、故所到之貨往往高岀現市售盤、其最大者、每箱則倒懸要一元五角、而最小者亦需虧蝕在五六角之譜、現市九十磅美貨開十六元、一百磅十六元五角、雙運九十鎊三十二元、一百磅三十三元、德貨九十磅十五元五角、一百磅十六元、雙連九十磅三十一元二角半、一百磅三十二元二角半、英法諸貨則斷擋無市、年内銀根緊急、實交殊難起色、</p>

<p>聰明有五種：機械的（Mechanical）聰明，抽象的（Abstract）聰明。社會的（Social）聰明，審美的（Artistic）聰明和道德的（Moral）聰明。機械的聰明是指這一類能力説的：如錶壞了會修，東西破了會補等等。有這種聰明的人容易接近機械理解機械，而不必經過特殊的訓練。抽象的聰明是和這全然不同的。有這種聰明的人，特别對於抽象的事物容易發生興趣，特别在這些事物上而顯岀其能力。學生把學校的各種功課都應付得好，智識慾强烈，長於寫作—這一種的學生就是具有這一類抽象聰明的人。還有一種學生，功課，運動，什麽都不行，他却有一種特長，就是會交際。他能在很短的時間内把好些生人弄得很熟，使大家都認得他，願意舉他當主席或代表。這一種人，我們説他是富有社會的聰明的人。審美的聰明很容易明白的，這是指一種長於鍳别判斷的能力説的。一件東西的美醜，一樁事情的好壞，在具有這種聰明的人是極易看岀的。至於道德的聰明，是一種在道徳归法律上不犯錯誤的聰明。有這種聰明的人，知道怎樣避免不作壞事，能够「入國問俗」，行為上多半是較為圓通的。</p>
<p>這五種聰明都很要緊。多數人大都僅有其中的一兩種，有三四種的就不是平凡的人，若五種兼而有之，則更是了不起的了。</p>
<p>這幾種聰明與我們的擇業上及職業上都有着很密切的關係。一種職業的適合我們與否，是决定於我們對牠有没有從事的能力與興趣。只有在這樣的條件下選擇的職業，我們才「能勝任愉快」，才能「事半功倍」，以底於成。即是，我們的聰明接近於某一種職業，從而選擇了這種職業，這結果自然就是我們在這職業上將必有一種高度的成就。不然的話，便不免是「盲人騎瞎馬」。不知選擇一種最適合的職業，而只是亂撞亂碰，結果是鮮有不失敗的。</p>
<p>但是，我們怎樣可以知道我們有没有某種聰明呢？這從我們的學校課業成績上及我們對某件事物的特殊興趣上可以看得岀來。假使我們是愛好算學和理化，在這方面有優異成績的，則無疑地我們是有這種才能而需要發展這種才能</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>；假使我們在任何塲合對於機械的事物有興趣，隨時隨地都想探究機械的内層秘密，像賣報童子愛廸生那樣，則無疑地我們也是有這種才能而需要發展這種才能。如此，則一個發明家的路是安排在我們的前面了。又如，假使我們對於機械，對於功課都没有興趣，但對於演説，辯論，交際等却表現岀一種特殊的才能，則我們就千萬不可忽略這種才能。學校不一定提倡這些，社會不一定鼓勵這些，但這些却仍是重要的，需要我們密切注意的。這是為社會服務的一種必要能力。世界上最大的權力者多是有着這種聰明能力的人。世界政治舞台上最岀風頭的人或在事業上最有成就的人，也多半是有着這種聰明能力的人。「書呆子」只配當當他們的秘書，就是發明家也常是他們的傀儡。</p>
<p>中國教育似乎還不大注意發展學生的社會的聰明，大都僅注意到發展他們的抽象的和機械的聰明。中國一般社會也同具着這同一意見。為了未來在職業界的成就，為了在業者能够對於職業少發生一些困難，我以為社會的聰明實有注意的必要。這不但是擇業的一個標準，也是使職業生活愉快的一個因素。</p>
<p>對於抽象的，審美的，道德的聰明，這裏，我不想作詳細的解説。不過大體上具有抽象的聰明的人最適宜於作文筆事情，具有審美的聰明的人最適宜於作美術方面的事情，具有道德的聰明的人最適宜於作改革社會的事情。這只是這幾種聰明影響於擇業上的見解，實際上，這幾種聰明在已有職業的人也是應該注意的。發展這幾種聰明或其中某一兩種聰明，是職業界人士使職業成功的一條路。我們可以説，在人生處世的途程上，這幾種聰明没有一種是少得掉的，不過在某些人其需要有多有少罷了。</p>

<h3 id="c223">凡爾賽的風光 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 春雨</p>
<p>大家都知道，凡爾賽是和法國國都巴黎同其古老且負有盛名的一地方。不錯，它是在巴黎的近郊，並且是很近的近郊；從巴黎到那裏，至多要不了半個鐘頭的火車，所以本來是可以將它的名字放在大巴黎城的名義下談論的。然而，如果這樣，那就未免委屈了它，因為它的著名是有其獨立的歷史聖蹟的。這不但由於它那裏有座巍峨的皇宫，偉大的噴水池，緑樹參天的大森林，成為法國一個最富於風光的遊人景仰地，而且就在歷史上，也因為它曾成為貴族，王公，一切舊的權威者的堅固堡壘的縁故。雖然這座堡壘現在已不能再保障他們了，但那是另一問題，事實上誰都知道一八七一年它曾盡過保衛那時的權威者的偉大作用，因為他們曾據此以為最後自衛和反攻的堅壁，並且以此轉敗為勝地終於戰勝了巴黎的平民。凡爾賽，它也就第一次因此留下了它的不朽的名兒。當然，如果還要説它的史蹟，那麽一九一四年大戰的結算，亦是在凡爾賽簽訂和約的，因此，它的盛名就是在最近也傳遍了全世界。</p>
<p>「喂！看哪！那段雖不甚大，却也很雄壯的土崗，就是凡爾賽喲！那座偉大，雄麗，古健的建築，不很高也不很矮，從緑蔭申展開了一段很大的面積，在晶白的陽光下輝煌它的金黄色的，就是凡爾賽宫啊！」，一個到過那裏的朋友在車中指給我看，同時帶着讚美驚奇的口氣告訴我。</p>
<p>幾分鐘後，車如死蛇一般的停住了。遊人們携帶着手提皮箱，酒瓶，麵包，水菓，從車上如决口的水似的湧下來，又如上灘的潮似的向那懶斜的山坡湧上去，然後才如浪頭的濺花樣一點一點的慢慢分散開來，躱入了凡爾賽的森林，皇宫中去了。這是法國人經常的享樂方法之一，當然大半是要在休假日才能如此。</p>
<p>我們，一禮拜工作疲乏後的我們，當然也學會了這點洋習慣，竟然照樣的到了凡爾賽，而且也一氣跑上那山坡去了。我們首先進謁那座皇帝之宫。在這久聞盛名的皇宫裏，一切簷額，牆頭，天花板上，都彫塑着古老，蒼健，複雜，美麗的花紋；金黄色的紫木紋的地板，使我們這從未稱過臣下奴才的賤民行走不慣，一不小心就會滑倒的，好在我抱着唯恐遺笑友邦的戒懼態度，算是「遊之遍也」以後，都没有跌過蹻。凡爾賽宫現在是成為大博物院了。由中世紀到現代的法國名畫，那是數不勝數的。動植物，礦石標本，寶石珠玉，遠古人類的遺物：石刀，石斧，石箭，一切歷史上的人類的發明品：古刀，古劍以至古繡，古織物等，都一如其他的博物院一樣，應有盡有。可是也能使我們中國人看了，於欣喜之中包含着晦氣，那就是那裏同時陳列着小脚繡脚，鸦片烟槍，等等。自然，這種特殊的風俗習慣，各民族在一定的發展階段上，都曾顯現過若干可笑的怪狀，然而法國人的遊客們看了以後，一種冷嘲嘻笑的態度，却使你有些難過啊！在凡爾賽的大廳裏，陳列着上次和約的簽字筆，以及大人先生們的坐椅，這是恊約國的一個驕傲紀念，但也是那次大戰中的二千萬無辜犧牲者的血的紀念，那枝筆是插在他們的肉裏血中的！</p>
<p>皇宫的下面，有着一個巨大的半圓噴水池，大小分成幾級，每級的池岸，池心，岸足，都有噴水管。而池岸池心則塑着無數裸體美女和獸類，在她們手裏拿着的花枝，瓶，和頭上頂的盤中，在那些動物口中，都噴着直的横的噴水，如像許多銀槍白劍交織穿鑿着。正中是幾個較大裸體美女塑像，她們頭上的高空，有着幾枝從這處射來的噴水，都集中在那裏碰頭落下，雪花暴雨就落在伊們的身上。還有，另外幾枝半平射的噴水，就對準着她們的××處射去。噴水的幾個主幹，是向上直射的，高到十丈左右；頂頭披落的水綫，有如四垂的麥穗，上頂亦如盛開的銀花。白光四射，美麗奪目的凡爾賽噴水池，誠不愧為世界聞名的噴水池。</p>
<p>在凡爾賽的山坡上，有一個人工造成的瀑布，也是用高壓水源作泉流的。人工修的一個瀑布的下瀉槽，寛自數尺至數丈不等，砌成無數的石級。石級的下面，裝置得有各色電燈，夜間開放，薄薄的水從那上面奔流而過，顯着五光十色的美景，令人玩味不置。這種瀑布的開放，其機會比噴水還要少些，是難得鑑賞到的。</p>
<p>我們曾在盛夏的天氣中遊着凡爾賽森林，這個森林面積是很大的，培植得有最高的樹木，當然柏樹，籐樹等等都有，蔭蓊蔽天，就是在盛夏的强烈日光之下，也只能在那些稀薄的葉叢中找個縫隙，偷偷地來窺看遊人。嫩緑的草地，和高聳在天空的樹葉，争賽着碧緑翠艷，争放着爽氣淸香，不但令人在它們的懷抱裏，忘却正夏的燥熱，而輕微的凉風，大有時令回春，薰得遊人帶醉的景象。森林中交錯着柏油馬路，兩岸的樹枝被剪得底寛頂窄，成為一種自然的搭橋蓬蓋，在絶頂處封鎖了天空，使你看不見鳥飛雲過。微雨之餘，柏油馬路原是一塵不染的，這時油滑光溜，比中國舊式婦女的油頭粉面還亮。在這森林裏，經常是醉飽着千萬遊客，而青年男女，也都乘此時陶醉於自然和性的愛海中，他們擁抱交眠於樹蔭草地上，這在法國人是不以為怪的。凡爾賽的風光，是極盡了自然的美麗，就在這點上也不負它所享的歷史的世界盛名，但這也只能成為法國的上等人終日醉飽的樂園，大多數人仍不過僅能偶爾嘗試而已。</p>

<h3 id="c225">評「偏見集」 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 叢集</p>
<p>——正中書局岀版定價六角——</p>
<p>凡是讀過梁實秋先生的文章的人，都會知道他是有一個固定的文學理論的體系的。無論在什麽塲合，只要一談到文學上的問題，他都是從「文學發於人性，基於人性，亦止於人生」（見梁著「浪漫的與古典的」：新月版）這觀點岀發，來説明一切文學現象的；同時，在這觀點下，他還有一個固定的「偏見」，即是他以為「人性是永久的，普遍的，固定的，没有時間空間限制與區别」（見梁著「文學的紀律」）。因之，在他看來，所謂作為「人性的産物」的文學，也就是古今如一，中外同然，永久不變，没有新舊之分的了。</p>
<p>最近岀版的梁先生的「偏見集」，雖是由三十一篇關於文學理論的或長或短的文章所集成的，但依然是在其固有的「偏見」之下，表現岀了他一貫的文學見解的。這一貫的見解當然是：「文學的精髓是人性描寫。」（見「人性與階級性」）「偉大的文學乃是基於固定的普遍的人性，從人心深處流岀來的情思才是好的文學，文學難得的是忠不實——忠於人性；至於與當時的時代潮流發生怎樣的關係，是受時代的影響，還是影響到時代，是與革命理論相合，還是為傳統思想所拘束，滿不相干，對於文學的價值不發生關係。因為人性是測量文學的唯一標準。」（見「文學與革命」）「人性是不變的。情感是没有新舊的。文學是有永久性的。」（見「文學的永久性」）梁先生真可謂始終如一，永遠「忠於人性」的文學批評家了。</p>
<p>但是，你相信古時的人的生活，性格，思想感情與近代人的完全相同嗎？你能説魏晋六朝時代的駢文，唐朝的詩，元朝的曲，明淸時代的通俗小説，與「五四」以後的白話文學是一樣的嗎？如果不能，那麽，所謂「固定普遍的人性」，「永久不變的文學」，便是存在於梁先生的「偏見」中的，在人間世上根本就找不岀來。</p>
<p>同時，梁先生自己也説：「什麽時代就産生什麽樣的文學，什麽樣的人就寫岀什麽樣的作品，這是一點不錯的。」（見「現代文學論」）「中國的舊劇有悠久的歷史，深入於民間，到如今還是根深蒂固。……在中國社會未整個的接受西方文化以前，舊戲永遠是存在的；換言之，中國的古老的社會傳統還被保留的時節，舊戲也無疑的可以延長它的生命。在目前，舊戲依然擁有它的龐大的聽衆，而新興話劇不過是極微弱的受着甚少數的智識份子的支持。」（同上）文學既是永久不變的，没有新舊之分，那麽，「什麽時代就産生什麽樣的文學」這話怎講呢？所謂「舊劇」，「新興話劇」等名詞果應作何解釋呢？又，「中國的古老的社會傳統還被保留的時節，舊劇也無疑的可以延長它的生命」；如果反過來説，那便是：「中國的古老的社會傳統一旦死亡，舊劇的生命即要馬上斷絶」。但這却表明這樣的一個真理：文學是社會的産物，是隨社會的發展而發展的；中國舊劇是依存於中國舊社會的，是隨舊社會的存亡而存亡的。這樣説來，所謂文學是古今如一，永久不變這樣的理論，實在是令人不解的「偏見」！</p>
<p>但是，梁先生又從另一方面説：「文學家並不表現什麽時代精神，而時代確是反映着文學家的精神。」（「文學與革命」）這如果與他的文學與時代無關係，是永久不變的這見解放在一起來看，再將他的「什麽時代就産生什麽樣的文學」一語加上去，那你便會不知道梁先生究竟是在玩什麽把戲了。因為這三個意見，誰都可以看岀是相互矛盾的，但梁先生捉住了這三個相互矛盾的意見，却認為都是對的，如此，你能説梁先生的對處究竟是在那裏嗎？</p>
<p>不過，梁先生之所以説「時代反映文學家的精神」者，是另有用意的。因為他迷信天才，以為人間一切都是天才們所創造，所以不得不以此為其理論的依據。請聽他説吧——「一切的文明，都是極少數的天才的創造。科學，藝術，文學，宗教，哲學，文字，以及政治思想，社會制度，都是少數的聰明才智過人的人所産生岀來的。」若依這個説法，則是如果没有天才，没有「少數聰明才智過人的人」，那恐怕人間社會都不存在了。天才，這真是創造一切的神人！</p>
<p>天才為什麽能創造一切呢？在梁先生看來，當然是因為他與衆不同，因為他是特别聰明，特别有才能的人。但是，為什壓天才會與衆不同呢？這恐怕只有説他是「天之驕子」了吧。但假如一個天才生在世上，没有人替他弄飯，做衣服，建築房子，没有什麽東西給他研究，絶對孤獨地生活着，那他也能創造岀什麽來嗎？若能，那他便真是神人了</p>
<p>天才創造一切，不必説，這也是「偏見」。</p>
<p>梁先生反對「為藝術而藝術」的理論，因為這理論不「嚴重」；但他却要保持文學的「獨立」，反對科學與文學結合，反對以科學方法來研究文學；同時他更堅定地説：「凡是在文藝範圍之外另尋方法拿來作為解釋一切文學之萬靈鑰匙者，大概都不免失敗，雖然其失敗有時是光榮的。」（「論第三種人」）你看，這不是「為藝術而藝術」的理論嗎？</p>
<p>够了，「偏見集」中的「偏見」實在太多，説不完的，就此帶住吧。</p>

<p>— 周樂山</p>
<p>章少將對於戰功有着很大的建樹，因此在Ｈ地的青年女子敬愛他比别個同年紀的英雄要勝一籌。在年輕的時候，他是熱戀着萍，他認為在Ｈ地她是一個最美麗最可愛的女子。有步驟的，章少將化了他所有的財産來設宴請她，想獲得她的愛。但是這個女子早已有了丈夫，所以對於他是毫不關心的樣子。</p>
<p>像這樣極高度的揮霍，章少將很快的窮困起來，被廹着搬到了一個小的鄉村裏去住。可是他仍舊保有着一隻他所心愛的鷹，這是没有地方可以買得到同樣的。現在他所遺留着快樂自己的，就是這隻鷹，另一方面，做工來養活他自己。</p>
<p>不久萍的丈夫害病死了。當一年的䘮服期滿後，萍遷到了另一個環境，碰巧離章少將的鄉村很近。現在，萍的兒子已變成了一個善於打獵的人，他看到章少將的這隻可愛的鷹，心裏很想得到牠。但是，他想不岀方法來得到牠，他知道這隻鷹的所有者是如何的愛牠。最後，這孩子生了病，他的母親是極端的愛她這唯一的兒子，她看護他，懇求他説岀他所要的東西在這世界上。他告訴他母親，説他要章少將的那隻鷹，假使得不到，那他便没有生的希望。</p>
<p>如此的愛她兒子，萍試想個方法來滿足他。她回憶到有錢時候的章少將，是怎樣的常常用盡種種方法來使她歡喜。她覺得不能立即去向他開口。結果，她允許她的兒子去得到這隻鷹，於是她同了一個女朋友去拜訪章少將。</p>
<p>碰巧這一天是不宜於放鷹岀去覓食，所以章少將是在他的園地裏。當萍呌他的時候，他是驚訝得説不岀話來，同時奔岀來歡迎她。</p>
<p>『章少將，』她説，『我是來償還當你愛我時你所受到的一切不幸，這償還就是今天我和我的同伴來吃飯！』</p>
<p>『我已忘了我為了你所受到的不幸，』章少將回答説，『假使這是我的權力，我將要為了你的光</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>榮第二次化去我的財産。』</p>
<p>一忽兒，章少將想到在有錢的時候，假使她親自來過訪，那他應當怎樣的欵待她。現在，他屋子裏已没有值錢錢食物了，他很着急，但是後來他想岀了一個方法來解决這困難。</p>
<p>很足够的，這桌上舖了一幅雲白的檯布，一種胆怯的記憶；以前是榮華過的，他們都坐下來，很快樂的吃着烤的鳥。待餐罷，這女人以為現在是宣佈她所以來拜訪他的目的的時候了。</p>
<p>「假使你追憶起我以前的冷酷，」她説，「無疑的，你將要想到我是這樣的放肆來懇求你。但是，假使你知道做母親者的愛力，我想你也不會責備我的。我的兒子看到你心愛的鷹，這是你僅有的一隻鳥，他是為了要得到牠而病得更形憔悴。所以我今天特來請求你送那隻鳥給我的兒子當一件禮物，我確信這樣可以救我的兒子。」</p>
<p>章少將開始很哀痛的哭泣了。萍想，這一定是他不願給那隻鳥的表示。她正預備作進一步的解釋，章少將却説：</p>
<p>「賢慧的夫人，當我第一次决定愛你的時候，命運對我是這樣的殘酷。但是，現在已時過境遷，你却自卑着來看我。在我有錢的時候，你從没有這樣的做過，也許是從没有這樣的想到過，更談不上會問我要一件小的禮物。命運是在捉弄着我，所以我没有這力量來答應你的請求。現在讓我來簡單的解釋給你聽。</p>
<p>「當你告訴我你和你的同伴來吃飯是來光榮我，我想，我是應當在可能範圍之内拿岀每一樣適合的食物來奉敬你。在這種情况之下，我就想到這隻鷹，就是你所要求我的。牠有極高尚的體質，又肥又慈和，所以我在這早晨就把牠守藏了起來，烤着當作宴客的佳品。那知道現在你要這隻鷹來救你生病的兒子，我没有能力來使你喜歡，悲哀的我將永無快樂的一日。」</p>
<p>説着，章少將把這可憐的鳥的羽毛，嘴和爪呈示給她看。萍責備他殺掉一隻如此好的鷹為了一個女人的午餐，同時她褒奬他的慷慨在她的心裏。</p>
<p>要得鷹的機會已經失去，要恢復她兒子的病是更失望，她説了一聲謝，離開了章少將。她的兒子不久以後就停止呼吸。她傷心着，她住在憂愁的氣氛裏，直等到她的哥哥希望她再嫁來恢復她的精神。</p>
<p>萍不想這樣做，但是她的哥哥勸服了她。最後她説：「我很願意再嫁，但……」似乎她回憶到章少將的大量，「這個我所願嫁的人，就是章少將。」</p>
<p>她的哥哥笑着回答説：「你為什麽這樣的愚笨？你願意嫁給一個乞丐嗎？」</p>
<p>「哥，」她答道，「我甯願選擇一個没有錢的人比一個有錢的人。」</p>

<h3 id="c227">電子之謎 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 揚波</p>
<p>原子世界，照近代自然科學的發現説來，要算比較古老的觀念了。因為以原子為最後不可分的質點，由其分解結合形成種種物類，因而能够説一切物體都是原子集團，整個世界不過是一個原子世界，這是從古代希臘的德模克里特起，就立定了的假説，而且為近代自然科學證實了的。然而，近代自然科學的前進，已經由原子窮究岀電子了，知道原子尚非最後不可分的質點。原子本身且是更小的電子所組成的。這就是説，雖然原子的存在和一切物類均為它所組成這種説法仍能成立，但若西問物類究竟是由甚麽最基本質點所組成，則現今的答覆已不能再説是原子，應該説是電子了。原子世界觀已經改變為電子世界觀了，所以人們常稱現在的世界為電氣世界。可是，所謂電氣世界，就普通人所理解到它的意義，不過是因為現在的燃燈，通信，傳話，播音，照像，驅車，轉動機器等等，都是用電氣，因而只從適用性的狹隘觀點上，去理解這一術語罷了。其實這是不够的。所謂電氣世界，如果很科學地去理解它，其本質是一個新的哲學的世界觀。因為流水，岩石，草木，鳥獸乃至我們人類自己，都不過是一團電氣，一團電子結合體呀！自然，這不是説一切物類就只是電子的量的堆積體而已，實際上，由量的增加變成各種各樣的有機組合體，因而成為各種質的不同的物類，已不再簡單地和電子同其性質。但一切物類為電子的集團，世界為電子所組成之電子世界觀，是不因此而動摇的。</p>
<p>電子是甚麽呢？從肉感上説，它是摸不着看不見的質點，因為它已小到不可思議的境地。『。一字大的一個氫氣泡已經含有幾百兆個原子，原子之小是可驚的了。但是，電子呢？它比最小的氫原子還要小千八百倍，所以它比分子原子超過肉體所能感覺的範圍更遠。電子雖然很小，但它的電量和質量，現在的科學界已經測得了美國。的密爾根測定結果，知道電子的電荷為：4，774×10-10靜電單位，而其質量為：9，0×10-28克，其大小之直徑則為：1，8×10-13種</p>
<p>普通所稱的電子，是指陰電子而言。其實電子云云，乃是指具有一定單位之電荷質點説的。如此，則電子是包括陰電荷質點和陽電荷質點二者，前者可以稱為陰電子，後者稱為陽電子。相同性質的電子，在本質上是没有差别的。九十二種原子都是由這本質上無差别的電子所組成。各種異其性質的原子，則不過是由於電子的數量不同的結果。比如氫原子是由一個陽電子作核心，一個電子作衛星所組成的，紬原子是以二三○個陽電子與一四六個陰電子組成核心，而以九二個陰電子作為衛星所組成的，就是例證。</p>
<p>關於電子的本質問題，現在科學界的觀念尚很混亂。一般的科學家是説電子僅僅是電氣團，並無實在的物質。雖然他們也承認電子有質量，但又説這種質量非普通觀點下所謂質量，即非實在不變的物質質量。所以修内潔在其「原子構造概論」中説：「普通吾人所謂質量者，乃物質之總量，無物質則無質量，有質量必有物質，且物質不因位置速度而生變化，故質量與此等亦無關係。然由電子本質之結論，與此常識甚相懸殊，即電子有質量而非物質。」可是，嚴格地説來，現今科學界對於電子本質的這種觀念是不正確的。無物質的質量和僅有電力而無物質基礎的電子，是不能存在的。刮去物質而僅保存電能，是能力主義的唯心觀點；承認電子僅有質量而無物質，則此質量成為空虚的觀念體，實在物質變成了觀念上的單純概念，也是唯心論的質量觀。這種觀點，是在電子的認識論上，表現岀了近代自然科學之非科學的觀念論危機。</p>
<p>近代自然科學家之　　電子質量為非物質的性量，其根本理由在於因電子質量能隨運動速度而變化。他們素以為物質之通常質量是不隨位置變化而有所改變的，電子質量既與此觀念不合，故為</p>

<p>— 惟元</p>
<p>許幸之吴印咸二君於月之十一，十二，十三，三天在八仙橋青年會九樓展覧他們繪畫和攝影方面的近作，對於這兩種藝術頗為愛好的我，乘機去飽看了兩次。現在我想把兩次參觀留下的印象在這裏留點下來。</p>
<p>許君的四十幾幅作品告訴我們，他的取材是很留意現實的描繪的。其中最引人注意的要算是以農村破産，災民流離失所為題材的「逃荒者」，和「失業者」，「晚步」，「江邊的路人」，「瘦馬」，「自畫像」及號外「阿Ｑ」等幾幅。「逃荒者」可謂已充分表現着在災荒襲擊下農民窮無所歸的悲慘形態。一對輾轉在饑餓綫上瘦骨嶙峋的老夫妻，在一片荒漠無垠雜草不生的荒凉的原野的大路上躑躅着。那老農手中抱着的僅剩得皮包骨頭的小孩，大概是他的垂斃的孫兒吧。他眼中露着無救的求助的光。在他旁邊還襯托着一條耐不住饑餓的小狗。這種題材，這種背景，再加以作者對現實的理解及數月的長期間的努力工作，這幅畫宜其有深深地感動人的力量了。尤其是那條狗，我認為在增加這幅畫的表現力上是更不可少的。在欣賞的當時，我曾想到，假使那老農肯把他抱着的小孩丢下時，那狗會馬上去噬嚙他的。而現在農村中也正多着野狗吃人的事實。</p>
<p>「失業者」是描寫一個失業的人垂頭䘮氣地憑倚在一所洋房面前的石階上作遐思的悲慘的姿態。「晚步」寫有閒者帶狗晚步的閒適。「江邊的路人」寫江邊路工用碎石舖路的辛勤狀况。「瘦馬」寫一匹饑餓的馬的瘦弱可憐。這幾幅畫大都很能引起一般人的注意，我也認為是這次展覧中比較有成績的作品。至於「阿Ｑ」一幅，我本來是抱着極大的希望去看的，結果却使我感到不像我所預期的那末好。這自然與繪製的時間有關係，但把「阿Ｑ」畫成那末一個蒼老，愚呆，低能的樣子，却似乎不合魯迅先生理想中的「阿Ｑ」。在畫的構圖，設色，筆力上，也似乎够不上許君其他的作品。</p>
<p>此外，許君的三幅舞臺圖案，其成績却也是值得一提的。</p>
<p>吴印咸君影展中我最喜歡的大概是下面幾幅：「浮彫」，「挑擔者」，「重荷者」，「睡蓮」，「晨市」，「汲水之女」，「恐怖」，「仰望」，「窗前」，「紙牌戲」，「透視」，「晚歸」等。其中「挑擔者」，「重荷者」，「晨市」，「紙牌戲」……等幾幅，都能有力地表現作者所欲表現的對象。「仰望」和「窗前」在影和實物的攝取上有着技術上的成功。「汲水之女」輪廓和光綫都很適合。其餘如「睡蓮」，「人體」有着技術上的成功。「汲水之女」輪郭和光綫都很適合。其餘如「睡蓮」，「人體」，「朝潮」，「透視」，「夢境」，「晚歸」……等在攝影技術上都有着可觀的成績。</p>
<p>此外，若「貴婦」，「憑倚」，「待吻」，「懷思」……等幾幅，則是較次一點的作品。</p>

<p>非物質的，其實這一觀念完全是為牛頓物理學之錯誤的質量不變那種舊觀點所誤的結果。新的電子物理學的研究，從事實上證明電子因運動而改變質量，愛因斯坦的相對原理，則更從理論上説明了物質質量因運動不同而有改變之可變性等等，這正是一方而否定着牛頓原理，他方面證明了質量之可變性。然而近代自然科學家，却反而根據已被推翻的牛頓物理學原理，即認電子質量因位置變化而變化是不合於質量不變的原理，來否認電子和其質量之物質性，這是如何迷亂的一件事啊！</p>
<p>科學地説來，電子並不是神秘不可知之謎。它是物質體的現今所發現的最後質點，它有電能，亦有質量，不但可由這樣的電子説明物質能之統一不分的物質觀，並且由其質量之可變性，亦説明了物質之非機械的物質觀。電子，若根據湯姆生所告訴我們的説，它「像一積氣體，它可以膨脹起來充滿它周圍所有的空間，同時也可收縮起來縮到很小的空間裏去。」；「電子本身可視為一個微粒，或為一波浪。」；以及根據電子質量能因運動而增加等等事實，都明明指示岀電子尚非最後不可分的整體，必為别種更小質點所組成，其自身亦為一種質點系的複合體。因為苟非如此，則它便不能起能大能小，能為質點能為波浪的變化，亦不能在運動中，由吸收能量而同時吸入質點，以增加質量，使質量變化。如此，則電子不是尚不能吸盡可以分割之無限自然界嗎？不是一切都如原子一樣，既為暫時的最後物質之發現，又為具有真實質量及能量，且為可變的物質實體，並非幻想的空虚的能力團子或觀念體嗎？電子不是並非不可解之謎，宇宙的分解達到電的世界，不是仍是實在的世界嗎？物質論的世界觀不是仍是勝利的嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c229">旅行一周回鄉記（一） <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 蘇鋼</p>
<p>我離開家鄉，算來已是整整的七年了；在這悠長的七年中，雖是給生活壓逼得喘不過氣來，可是有時也會有「舉首望明月，低頭思故鄉」的這樣一種感喟！思念家鄉的情緒，想是人人都不能免的吧？</p>
<p>事情來的凑巧，當我正被「思鄉病」糾纏得不可開交時，突然地一封蓋着家鄉郵局的戳子的信岀現在我的眼前了；當時真使我這個被家鄉摒棄的「野仔」（註：五年不回家，就被認為是忘家的野仔）如同見了親人一般的感動，這簡直是一樁意外的收獲。</p>
<p>這時我的情緒真是緊張到了萬分，幻滅了的家鄉情景又在腦神經裏湧現起來，恨不得一口氣就看完那封信的始末；可是，信的内容並没有像我所預期的那麽使我滿足，除了報告了一點家常瑣碎的事之外，是望我在這「地方承平」的當兒回鄉一走。</p>
<p>是的，自我離開家鄉的幾年來，家裏的人可説没一天不是度着躭驚受嚇的磨難的生活；趁這「地方承平」的當兒，也應該回去給他們一些安慰喲！</p>
<p>我在接信的那天晚上，便决定了行程；在後三天的一個下午，我乘的這隻江輪駛抵九江碼頭。</p>
<p>在九江没有多的躭擱，第二天早晨就趁南潯鐵路的火車先到南昌。在南昌歇宿了一宵，第二天一早起來，就忙着喊茶房替我捲鋪蓋；可是，茶房作怪了，我喊了幾聲：「茶房！茶房！」却没有人來。我看了看手錶，時間是快到八點鐘了，不由得我不更急了起來；於是我忿然地跑岀去喊了輛車子，把鋪蓋搬上車，呌車夫拖到章江門搭小輪船。</p>
<p>正在我將要走的當兒，客棧的老闆忽忙地迎面走來，衝着我就問：「你老是到上饒去麽？小輪船没有了啊！」</p>
<p>「没有了？」</p>
<p>「是啊！早就没有了……」</p>
<p>「這可怎麽辦哩？」</p>
<p>「去還是有船去的，不過慢點。」他説。接着又説：「這船倒也是快船，可是這會子還不會開呢！」</p>
<p>「有船麽？怎麽這會子又不開咧？」我從車子裏跳了下來。</p>
<p>「你老！這種船靠裝人是不合算的；聽説要到十二點鐘才開。」他似乎很有把握的説。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e13">Sea Reduction Talks and Political Issues <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>The Sea Reduction Preparatory Conference has been underway for more than a month since it began. A month ago, Japan's demand was said to be naval equality. However, after the compromises and negotiations on the forum, not only has there been no progress whatsoever in the inside situation, but there is also a sign of immediate breakdown. The biggest crux in this is that Japan is determined to achieve substantive equality with Britain and the United States, refusing to make any concessions. And Britain and the United States have failed to respond to Japan with the same steps and strength. What is most heartbreaking to us is that the Far East political issues, which are closely related to the sea reduction problem, are being wiped out.</p>
<p>We have always said that negotiating sea reduction must take political issues into account, otherwise it is meaningless. The purpose of sea reduction is the same as general disarmament, and they both aim to ensure international peace and end acts of aggression, not to encourage war and aggression. In other words, sea reduction that can ensure peace and end aggression is meaningful. Otherwise, sea reduction is just sea reduction, and war cannot be avoided, and aggression cannot be stopped. What is the value of the empty name of sea reduction? The original purpose of convening the previous Washington Naval Conference was to eliminate the crisis in the Pacific, and Far East peace was particularly important. As for sea reduction, it was only a means to achieve this peace. Therefore, this conference, in general, was a meaningful and purposeful conference. However, its major mistake was that Britain and the United States thought that the ratio of 5:5:3 was enough to control Japan. Who knew that the facts showed the world that it was not the case. Since the 918 Incident, the United States has only been able to protest on paper against Japan's actions in our Northeast. The British have hesitated even more to issue this paper protest. Is it not because Japan's geographical advantage has exceeded the limits that the individual naval power of Britain and the United States can sanction? Therefore, can we not but sit idly by and watch the political clauses stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty and the Four-Power Treaty being torn up? From this point of view, although the Washington Naval Conference had the grand ambition of maintaining Far East peace, the ratio of 5:5:3 that it set was already a major mistake. The current plan is to learn from the past and correct the old mistakes so that the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty can exist in the Far East. Ambitious countries have no way to carry out their conspiracies of aggression, and then can we not betray the original intention of sea reduction. Otherwise, what is the difference between encouraging ambitious countries to nibble away and accelerate world war?</p>
<p>However, in the three-nation talks for more than a month, the only one who has raised the Far East political issues is the United States. Its repeated statements in advocating maintaining the old ratio of the Washington Treaty and restraining the further increase of the Japanese navy are still close to the mark. The British attitude is quite ambiguous, which has made the Japanese attitude stronger and the claims more firm, with a tendency to not stop until substantive equality is achieved. A few days ago, British Foreign Secretary Simon asked the Japanese about their attitude towards Far East political issues. We thought that Britain and the United States were tending to coordinate. However, since Simon declared that sea reduction still has hope after the Japanese refused to talk about political issues, his intention is still to compromise in order to prevent the talks from breaking down. However, from our perspective, if we only talk about warships and cannons without addressing political issues, then even if it can be achieved, what benefit will it bring to international peace?</p>
<p>Moreover, if this sea reduction conference is to succeed, it must allow the Japanese to increase their naval status. Once their naval status is increased, the Japanese can dominate East Asia, and even close the doors of East Asia. Once this happens, I am afraid that the lessons the Japanese give to the British will not be limited to a Manchurian oil monopoly. Therefore, for the British, this ambiguous attitude is actually harmful and useless. The best solution is to focus on political issues and use sea reduction as a means, joining hands with the United States to seek true world peace. If this can be achieved, then the success of sea reduction will be the guarantee of peace.</p>

<p>Baldwin Eager for U.S. Entry into the League of Nations</p>
<p>Echoing the Hull Declaration</p>
<p>No Less Than a Disguised Warning to Japan</p>
<p>Glasgow - Lord President of the Council Baldwin stated here today in a speech on the Far Eastern peace issue, discussing the wartime use of the British Far Eastern Fleet. Baldwin declared, "As far as Britain is concerned, as long as I am in office, and without understanding the attitude of the United States, I will never allow the British navy to deal with any local war." This statement evoked an electric reaction from the audience. After a moment of silence, the entire hall erupted in thunderous applause. Currently, Britain is suggesting to the United States that if the London Naval Talks break down due to Japan's insistence on equality, Britain and the United States should cooperate to deal with the situation. Baldwin's words today have a dual significance. (23rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Conservative Party leader and Lord Privy Seal Baldwin delivered a speech at the Glasgow Conservative Party meeting last night, stating, "The collective peace system is a good thing, but in my personal opinion, it is difficult to implement at present. Unfortunately, the United States is not yet a member of the League of Nations, and in the last two or three years, Germany and Japan have successively withdrawn from the League of Nations. If these facts exist, the collective peace system has little value. Since these countries do not participate, I dare say that the collective peace system will not work. As for whether Britain will participate in the collective peace system, the government should decide. As long as I am in office, I will insist that the British navy cannot independently blockade any country in the world before understanding the attitude of the United States. Whether the United States can abandon its traditional isolationist policy is difficult to say, but if major countries cannot become members of the League of Nations, we cannot make the League of Nations a strong organization. If Japan and Germany remain outside the League of Nations, the League of Nations will find it difficult to fulfill its responsibilities, which I dare to say. What we should do now is to work hard to make countries that were previously members of the League of Nations return to the League of Nations. In my personal belief, I believe this can be achieved, and I also believe that one day, the United States will also join this international group." (24th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull today expressed enthusiastic support for Anglo-American cooperation in the naval talks. Hull's statement was made during a conversation with newspaper reporters. The reporters asked about the British Foreign Secretary Simon's statement that the failure of the naval talks would be detrimental to all countries. Hull told reporters that he wished to make this statement an official declaration, and said that Foreign Secretary Simon had spoken frankly about the difficulties encountered in the naval conference. The silver lining in the negotiations was the harmony and closeness of the delegations, and he especially admired the British delegation's consistently sincere and cooperative attitude. Diplomatic circles here believe that this statement is intended to unite Anglo-American cooperation to reject Japan's demand for naval equality. Hull's reference to the friendly and close relationship of the delegations only indirectly involved the Japanese delegation, but he especially complimented the British delegation. Therefore, this statement is tantamount to a clear response to Britain, indicating that the United States is happy to cooperate with Britain when Britain and the United States cannot accept Japan's demands. (23rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull commented on the naval talks and expressed enthusiastic support for the speech delivered by British Foreign Secretary Simon in the House of Commons yesterday. It is now interpreted that Hull's statement is a disguised warning to Japan, meaning that if Japan builds a navy exceeding the quantity stipulated in the Washington Treaty, the United States and Britain will jointly deal with it. It is reported that the British side has already planned for the failure of the naval talks and has cautiously made suggestions to the United States to take concerted action, and President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have also discussed it. As for what instructions the U.S. government will give to Norman Davis, who is currently in London, the State Department does not want to disclose. (23rd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[New York] Secretary of State Hull commented on the naval talks yesterday and expressed enthusiastic support for the speech delivered by British Foreign Secretary Simon in the House of Commons the day before. A Washington correspondent for the New York Min Sheng Bao declared that Hull had received a telegram from London beforehand, stating that the representatives of Britain and the United States had decided to take concerted action to insist on the extension of the Washington Naval Treaty, and therefore issued the above declaration. The reporter also stated that Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito had given a speech in the Philadelphia newspaper the day before, stating that the Japanese cabinet had now decided to announce the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty without hesitation. Then, a few hours after Secretary of State Hull issued the above declaration, the reporter continued to say that Hull's endorsement of British Foreign Secretary Simon's declaration was intended to show other countries that Britain and the United States were closely cooperating on Far Eastern issues. It is generally believed that this declaration is sufficient to prove that Britain and the United States have agreed on general goals. In addition, the New York Times correspondent in Washington also stated that no matter how the naval talks end, Britain and the United States will have broader cooperation methods for Far Eastern policies than before, but it is impossible for Britain and the United States to form an alliance at present, because the traditional policy of the United States does not support alliances. The reporter also said that Hull's declaration also has a function, because some people in the United States criticize Britain, saying that it has little sympathy for the United States, so Hull issued the above declaration to comfort them. As for Japanese Ambassador Saito's announcement that Japan has decided to declare the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty, the American officialdom does not find it strange, because the Japanese ambassador's announcement of this matter must first obtain the consent of his government, which is beyond doubt.

<p>New Developments Expected</p>
<p>Japanese Side Prepared to Offer New Proposal</p>
<p>[London] The most noteworthy development in the current bilateral naval talks is the meeting between the U.S. and Japanese representatives scheduled for Monday, when U.S. representative Davis will go to the Japanese embassy to meet with Matsudaira. This is the first informal talk between the main representatives of the U.S. and Japan, which should end the period of waiting and see. Davis claimed today that the U.S. is well aware that Japan would not have come to London for these talks if it only wanted to withdraw from the Washington Naval Treaty. The U.S. is now confident that Japan will change its uncompromising attitude. This optimism is supported by the statement made by Japanese representative Yamamoto to a Reuters interviewer today, who claimed that he has some ideas to reconcile the differences between the negotiators. Here in the U.S., there is talk of a strong British-American cooperation front to reject Japan, but this statement overemphasizes the British view that if the naval ratio is to be abolished, some parts of the Washington Naval Treaty should be preserved. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e25">Japanese Government Decides to Unilaterally Declare Treaty Abolition <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Timing Around Mid-December</p>
<p>Demand for Equality Held to Be Rational</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Hirota, in view of the situation in the naval talks, believes that a joint announcement of the abandonment of the Washington Treaty is impossible. Therefore, he believes that there is only a unilateral announcement of abandonment. The results of the meeting of the top leaders of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning have formally decided on the following policy:</p>
<p>(1) The Imperial Government will not be bound by the naval talks in London and will announce the unilateral abandonment of the Washington Treaty. (2) The timing of the announcement of the abolition of the treaty will not be affected by domestic matters such as the opening of parliament. It will be implemented quickly after the procedures are completed. (3) One party issues a notice of abandonment, and the other party declares abandonment in the form of a representative's speech or a statement by the foreign affairs authorities.</p>
<p>Based on the above policy, Representative Matsudaira will express the intention to unilaterally abandon the treaty to the diplomatic agencies of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy at the earliest opportunity. As for the timing of the abandonment notice, it has been roughly set for mid-December. (24th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained to the press today the reasons for Japan's demand for naval equality, stating, "(1) Japan's demand is based on the increasing importance of its prestige and its position in world politics. (2) The Japanese people unanimously demand a full sense of security." It also stated that Foreign Minister Hirota will elaborate on everything when he speaks on the naval talks issue in parliament on November 28. According to news reports, the Japanese government will notify the signatory countries of the Washington Naval Treaty and will, around December 10, notify the powers of its abolition in accordance with Article 23 of the treaty. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Philadelphia - Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito stated in a speech to the American Political Science Association tonight that Japan will announce the abolition of the Washington Treaty regardless of the development of the London talks, but will also propose a 50% reduction in naval armaments. Japan's current naval strength is about 800,000 tons, including 250,000 tons of battleships, 70,000 tons of aircraft carriers, and a number of heavy cruisers. Japan is willing to reduce this tonnage by half, but only on the condition that Britain and the United States also reduce to a level equal to Japan. Japan has no intention of annexing the Philippines and is willing to conclude an agreement to jointly protect it from foreign aggression. The "Manchukuo" will continue to strictly maintain the open-door policy, but due to environmental factors, Japanese goods will occupy most of its market. (23rd National Telegram)</p>

<p>Army Budget Bill Passed by the Chamber of Deputies</p>
<p>[Paris] The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement today, declaring that all rumors about a military agreement between France and Russia are unfounded. After the Foreign Ministry issued an official statement, it released a semi-official explanation, stating that the political amity sought between France and Russia a few months ago had the sole purpose of organizing for peace, and was therefore not intended to deal with any country. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] Army Budget Reporter Achard declared in the Chamber of Deputies today during the debate on the army budget that the Soviet Union is willing to assist France with its solid and sharp army in the event of war between France and Germany. This statement has attracted great attention from European political circles and has been widely commented on. However, a certain French official told a Reuters interviewer today that there is absolutely no alliance or military agreement between France and Russia. The French government has never accepted the Soviet government's suggestion of a military alliance. Many members of the Chamber of Deputies believe that this is what Achard was referring to when he mentioned the Russian government's willingness to help France resist Germany. The official also said that France is still exploring ways with the Soviet Union to establish an Eastern Pact including Poland and Germany. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] A Reuters correspondent in Geneva cabled that Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov declined to comment on the declaration made by the French Army Budget Reporter. Those in the know in Geneva believe that Achard's remarks are a political tactic aimed at getting French Foreign Minister Laval to continue the pro-Russian policy advocated by Minister without Portfolio Herriot and the late Foreign Minister Barthou. Laval has so far shown a tendency to be more detached than Barthou, so the possibility of a better understanding between France and Germany has not been eliminated.</p>
<p>At the same time, a Reuters telegram from Moscow stated that the semi-official circles doubt whether the Soviet government had ever suggested providing military assistance to France. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Chamber of Deputies today passed the military budget, stipulating that defense spending will be 5,690,000,000 francs. This was passed after Achard and Fabry explained the Eastern Line crisis. Colonel Fabry told the Chamber of Deputies that France lacks aircraft, especially bombers. We must recruit experienced soldiers to guard the border fortresses, and we need a better national defense organization to resist attacks by poison gas and tanks. (23rd National Telegram)</p>

<p>[Paris] The Council of State this morning specifically discussed various diplomatic issues and approved the government's reply to Poland regarding the draft Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. (26th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact incident, Polish Foreign Minister Beck submitted a memorandum to the late French Foreign Minister Barthou in Geneva on September 27 of this year, explaining the reasons why Poland could not participate. The French government has now drafted a reply and will submit it to tomorrow's Council of State for approval, and then hand it over to the French Ambassador to Poland, Laroche, to be forwarded to the Polish government. Before it is delivered to Warsaw, the French government, in accordance with diplomatic etiquette, is unable to issue a statement explaining the main points of the reply. However, according to general knowledge, the wording of the reply is extremely precise, and all the points raised in the Polish memorandum have been taken into consideration, indicating France's sincere understanding of Poland's various objections. According to information obtained by this agency, Poland made a reservation regarding Lithuania (Note: Poland and Lithuania have not yet restored normal diplomatic relations due to the sovereignty issue of the city of Vilnius, which is in dispute). The French reply will record this reservation. Poland has also raised opinions regarding its relations with Czechoslovakia and Germany, and the French reply has also taken this into consideration (Note: Poland signed a non-aggression agreement with Germany on January 26 of this year, and as for the relations between Poland and Czechoslovakia, it roughly refers to the dispute between the two countries in December last year. At that time, former Polish veterans held a demonstration in West Silesia in the city of Cieszyn, which is located between the two countries and belongs to both countries. After the demonstration, three Poles were arrested in Czechoslovakia, so Poland also expelled more than 20 Czech expatriates from its territory). (23rd Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] Yu Jichuan, Director of the Hunan Construction Department, said that the Jiangxi bandits are doing everything possible to flee to Hunan, hoping to enter Sichuan and join forces with Xu Xiangqian's troops. Commander-in-Chief He Jian is personally supervising the suppression in Hengzhou, and the Guangxi army of the Western Route Army is also deploying defenses in Guixi. The Southern Route Army of Guangdong is also tracking and pursuing them. The bandits are experiencing a shortage of guns, ammunition, and food and are in a desperate situation. The rivers in Hunan are vast and the defenses are tight, making it difficult to cross. The only other way for the Red bandits to steal across is in the Xing'an Huangsha River area of Guizhou Province. The prospects for the bandit suppression campaign are optimistic. However, the westward escape of the Red bandits has caused some panic among the people of Hunan, and commerce has been invisibly suspended. The drought is severe and there is no tax revenue at all. Hunan's finances have reached the end of the road. Although the construction of the Hunan-Guangxi provincial road has already started, there is still an urgent need for funds.

<p>Shantou Correspondence: Communist bandits have been severely suppressed by the National Army's encirclement on all sides, losing more than half of their elite forces. They have already fled to Linwu and Lanshan in southern Hunan. However, Peng Dehuai's forces have not yet fled into Hunan. The important bandit Ye Jianying is currently in Huichang, attempting to gather the remnants. The Fourth Column of the Eastern Route Army is actively pursuing them after recovering Ruijin. On the 17th, Yudu was also recovered. It is no longer possible for the remnants of Peng and Ye in southern Jiangxi to flee further west, as the Communist bandits have now been cut into three segments. The first segment is on the Hunan-Guangxi border in Linwu and Lanshan, the second segment is between Shangyou and Chenzhou, and the third segment is in the Huichang Zhang River area. Peng's bandit forces in the third segment attacked Hanfang in Xinfeng on the 12th but were repelled by the Southern Route Army. Ye's bandit forces also attacked Junmenxu on the evening of the 10th but were also repelled by the Southern Route Army, with several hundred bandits killed. On the evening of the 14th, Ye's bandit forces attacked Luotian and Da Sanggang in the eastern part of Junmen Ridge and engaged in fierce fighting with the [illegible] regiment [illegible]. The fighting gradually subsided on the 15th. Unexpectedly, the bandits launched a sneak attack on Wuping from the mountains, detouring through Yangjiaoying, Mao Village, and entering Yongpingzhai and Da Shuikeng. This area is located on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi, with high mountains and dense forests, and has historically been a haven for local Communists. The [illegible] division of the Southern Route Army has launched a fierce attack on them. The [illegible] division has also returned to Pingyuan to jointly attack Ye's bandit forces. It is believed that the Communist bandits on the Jiangxi-Fujian border are like trapped beasts and are expected to be annihilated soon. (19th)</p>

<h3 id="e94">Regarding the Visit of the British Industrial Mission to Manchuria <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Publication of Correspondence between the British Industries Federation and Envoy Guo</p>
<p>Envoy Guo Also Lodges a Protest with the British Foreign Office</p>
<p>A London special correspondent for the North China Daily News reported on October 30th that the publication of correspondence between Lord Scott, Chairman of the British Industries Federation, and Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Envoy to Britain, contained acrimonious revelations and gave rise to pointed criticism.</p>
<p>Lord Scott wrote to Envoy Guo on August 9th as follows: "Your Excellency, the British Industries Federation has resolved to send a small mission to examine the commercial conditions in Manchuria and Japan, which you may already know. I enclose a copy of the notice which will shortly appear in the newspapers. It would be most gratifying if the mission could have the opportunity to visit China, but the mission's time does not permit this. However, I particularly hope that Mr. Bigot, representing the British steel industry, will be able to visit China to discuss certain issues related to his industry." Envoy Guo replied as follows: "Your Lordship, I have received your letter of August 9th, informing me that your Federation will send a mission to Manchuria and Japan. I express my sincere gratitude for your courtesy and good intentions. I also understand that you hope that Mr. Bigot, representing the steel industry, will be able to visit our country to discuss certain issues related to his industry. I must express my regret that the entire mission cannot spare time to visit our country, for even though our country has temporarily lost Manchuria, all goodwill and markets are of great benefit and value to industrialists and manufacturers in the Far East. I am confident that you share this sentiment. I dare say that the existing and potential British investments in the Chinese market are worthy of your Federation's attention and following, purely from a trade perspective and without involving the clear legal and moral disputes contained in the current secession of the puppet Manchuria from China. Our country's newspapers have expressed great concern upon hearing the news of your mission's visit to Manchuria and Japan. After receiving your letter, I conveyed my concerns to your Foreign Office. Unfortunately, these concerns have been confirmed by news reports from our country. Moreover, regardless of the negative repercussions that this may cause to our country, it must be stated that in areas where Japanese power is strong, trade opportunities for other countries besides Japan are indeed very limited. In the past two years, foreign firms in Manchuria, including those from your country, have been forced to close down. Reputable British companies, such as the Kailan Mining Administration, have suffered great losses due to Japanese interference and discrimination. The special dispatch from Dalian published in the Times on Saturday, August 11th, clearly shows how and why such incidents are unavoidable due to the Japanese. In today's puppet Manchuria, the open-door policy is nominally a political principle, but in reality, it is just empty talk. This has already been proven in writing. As the Chinese Envoy to London, it is my duty to protect and enhance the good understanding between the people of our country and the businessmen of your country, just as it is my duty to promote good understanding between our government and the government to which I am accredited. Therefore, I must frankly express my opinion that, from a long-term perspective, this mission is unlikely to achieve its desired results. Trade in the Far East must be achieved and distributed through sincere cooperation. This cooperation contains many factors. We all regard the great market of China not only as the cornerstone of Asian trade but also as a large part of the arch itself. I have no doubt about this. It is the real understanding and cooperation in this great mutual undertaking that will ultimately benefit your country's shipping and commerce. This is what British and Chinese businessmen and people should strive for. I believe that you will agree with my views. Politics are easily influenced by trade and can also influence trade. If so, then China is not only the center of Asian trade but also the center of Asian politics."</p>
<p>Lord Scott replied to Envoy Guo as follows: "I am most grateful for your letter of the 14th of this month. I assure Your Excellency that the British Industries Federation is deeply aware of the importance of trade between China and Britain and is willing to continue its past efforts in every way to encourage friendly trade relations between the people of the two countries. You must be aware of the various steps we have already taken in this regard, especially the various facilities we have provided to Chinese trade students to enable them to continue their business studies in our country. I am pleased that this plan was initiated by us. We are very satisfied with the results of this initiative, as it has shown various prospects for expanding its scope and becoming a valuable channel for mutual contact between business circles. We sincerely hope to continue our efforts to maintain the most friendly trade relations with your country. I can assure Your Excellency that anything the Federation can do in this regard will be greatly welcomed by me as its chairman." It is reported that Envoy Guo later lodged a protest with the British Foreign Office, opposing the dispatch of this mission to Manchuria. The British Foreign Office replied that the Foreign Office had not been involved in this matter and that it was purely a commercial endeavor with no political implications. Regarding this matter, although no announcement has been made, it is said that Envoy Guo does not accept this view.</p>
<p>The mission then departed, which is well known. The newspapers this week have all reported on the remarks made by Lord Barnby, the leader of the mission, on the eve of his departure from Tokyo. Baron Eyoh, Chairman of the Japan Economic Association, also left Tokyo for Manchuria. Lord Barnby's remarks were as follows: "As a result of harmonious discussions between leading representatives of the Japanese business and commercial world and the British industrial mission, it has been agreed in principle that committees of the Japan Economic Association and the British Industries Federation should be established in Tokyo and London to discuss issues relating to the industries and commerce of both countries with a view to arriving at a satisfactory solution. It was also agreed that the Japan Economic Association and the British Industries Federation should be invited to implement this type of project in a continuous manner in order to promote mutually beneficial trade relations between Japan and Britain."</p>
<p>A London correspondent for the Daily Mail once wrote that "the Japanese really want to obtain bank loans in 'Manchukuo'. The political reasons for this are even greater than the financial reasons. Sir Seligman has openly informed the Japanese side that 'the opinion of the responsible parties in Britain' (Sir Seligman's remarks probably refer to the opinion of the banking community) is now in favor of the revival of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. It is now being discussed that this financial assistance should first be obtained through private banking channels, but later this loan should be consolidated, and public bonds should be issued in the London market. It is said that the Japanese side is particularly keen on this, as they believe that obtaining direct concern for 'Manchukuo' from ordinary British investors would be of great political benefit to the Japanese."</p>
<p>Since Sir Seligman made the above remarks in Tokyo, I (the correspondent referring to himself) therefore add a piece of news heard on Friday's Daily Mail, which I believe can be regarded as very accurate.</p>
<p>The words and deeds of Lord Barnby, Sir Seligman, and their colleagues in the British Industries Federation mission in Tokyo have caused great consternation in London political circles. It has been stated in advance that the mission has no official status and no right to discuss any political issues between Britain and Japan. Therefore, even if it is undertaken in a semi-official capacity, it is not possible. But after Lord Barnby spoke of linking Britain and "Manchukuo" into a chain of friendship, he added, "The British government is well aware of our purpose and has given us various encouragements." It is no wonder that Tokyo views this as "probing opinions."</p>

<p>General Headquarters Orders Administrative Commissioners to Handle Relief Work</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The pseudo 25th and 28th Armies have been harassing the border areas of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui since 1932, and their momentum has been great. Although they have been severely suppressed several times, they have not been fundamentally eliminated. Recently, according to the news released by the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the three provinces, since Chairman Chiang came to Hankou in October and convened the generals of the three provinces to give instructions in person, Shangguan Yunxiang was appointed as the commander of the pursuit and suppression team, which was divided into five detachments. On October 15th, they began to jointly suppress the bandits. At that time, the bandits' strength was about 3,000 men with more than 2,000 guns. However, the officers and soldiers of the National Army fought bravely and took the lead, so they were able to repeatedly annihilate the strong enemy. The Pei and Wang detachments killed more than 300 bandits in the battle of Taojiahe on October 27th. The bandits knew that their future was precarious, so they fled erratically, trying to avoid battle, while the National Army followed closely, leaving no room for respite. In the battle of Hongqishan on November 4th, the Hao detachment and Wang brigade killed more than 600 bandits and dispersed the bandits' baggage and coolie teams, women's teams, etc. The remaining bandits became even more embarrassed. On November 8th, they fled to the Yunwu Mountain area of Guangshan County in an attempt to resist stubbornly by occupying the mountain, but were trapped. However, before the bandits could climb to the mountainside, the Xing and Liu detachments had already arrived, and the two sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The fierceness of the battle was rare. In this battle, 600 to 700 bandits were killed. The remaining bandits buried all the wounded and sick bandits alive and fled west in a panic, carrying only pseudo-important political personnel. In order to eliminate the root of the problem, our pursuit and suppression teams continued to pursue them in formation. In the battle of Luoguzhai on the 16th, the Liu detachment killed more than 100 bandits. The remaining bandits, numbering less than 1,000, crossed the Pinghan Railway to the west on November 17th, with the intention of entering Sichuan and Shaanxi. They are currently being relentlessly pursued and intercepted by the National Army's pursuit teams and local garrisons. The bandits are at the end of their rope, and the day of annihilation should not be far off. As for the relief work, the General Headquarters has submitted a request to the Xingying, which will be handled by the administrative commissioners. In addition, in the Yangrui border area between Hubei and Jiangxi, there was also the pseudo-newly編團. After being severely suppressed by the various units of the Third Column of the Western Route Army, the bandit leader Zou Zhimu was captured, and Zhang Tao went missing. The remaining 200 to 300 people were scattered and hidden. Recently, they were collected by Liu Yonghong and others in the Yangshugang area and formed into two battalions. On the 17th of this month, the National Army's Zhang Liansan Brigade heard the news and advanced to suppress them. They happened to be holding an enlarged meeting in Zhangjia, Qingshan,召集ed bandits from northern Jiangxi and Longhu and Rui, so they were given a severe blow. Two pseudo-guerrilla captains, Xiang Yushan and Shen Gengtong, were captured alive, and one pseudo-regiment commander, Wu Ying, and more than ten bandits were killed. More than 20 rifles were seized. The remaining bandits fled in panic towards Yangduan and are still being tracked down. As for the remnants of He Long's bandit forces on the border of Hubei and Hunan, they once infiltrated Yongshun in western Hunan, but were recovered by the Hunan Army's Chen Quzhen Division. The remnants fled towards Sangzhi, attempting to infiltrate western Hubei. The large army of Xu Yuanquan's troops is blocking the key areas, and it is determined that they will not cross the Leichi border.</p>
<p>Overall, the current bandit suppression situation is that the old nest of the Jiangxi bandits has been completely destroyed, and the military operation can be concluded. There are less than 1,000 remaining bandits on the border of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and it is also expected that they will be completely eliminated. (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Coal Mine Survey in Various Counties of Henan Province <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Reserves Rank Fourth in the Country</p>
<p>Sufficient for 3,500 Years of Mining</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The coal reserves in various counties of Henan Province are about 9,401,080,000 tons. Except for Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Sichuan, no other province can compare. The production area covers about 1,734 square kilometers, and the annual output is only 2,570,000 tons, accounting for only 0.0273% of the reserves. According to the current mining rate, it is sufficient for 3,500 years of mining. Therefore, the coal industry in Henan is just beginning to flourish.

<p>Commercial Depression, Industrial Crash</p>
<p>Poor Local Products, Trade Deficit</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The commercial situation in Guangdong Province has been very poor recently. Large stores in Guangzhou City have been closing down from time to time. The main reason is the sluggish business, the weak purchasing power of the people, and the depletion of funds in the market, which has led to a crash in industry. Taishan and other counties have always been known as prosperous areas, but recently, due to a sharp reduction in the inflow of foreign capital and the unemployment of many overseas Chinese who have returned to the country, the market has been greatly affected. The bankruptcy of silver firms and merchants has also been seen several times. Shantou is an important trading port, but in recent years, it has been affected by the recession overseas, and the financial situation is extremely difficult. Since the financial turmoil occurred in the market, it has not yet returned to its original state. Although the issuance of market merchant treasury certificates has maintained it for a while, there is still no way to clear the bills issued by silver firms. Overall, the economic situation in various places is very pessimistic.</p>
<p>As for Guangdong Province's foreign trade, from January to September of this year, according to the statistics of various customs offices, the province's trade deficit reached more than 64 million yuan (according to the statistics of the Guangdong Provincial Investigation and Statistics Bureau). This leakage is truly alarming. During these nine months, the total import of foreign goods was 120,508,925 yuan, and the total export of local goods was 57,857,718 yuan. Comparing the two, the trade deficit was 64,661,207 yuan. The following is a list of the import and export statistics of foreign trade by customs office from January to September:</p>

<p>Suspect in Jiang Surname Fire Reported</p>
<p>The fire at the Jiang family home outside the West Gate, a tragic case where four lives were lost, hit Jiang Shicong, of the Xiao Liu Fang (Little Sixth Branch), the hardest, as they were the most affluent. Lao Liu Fang (Old Sixth Branch) who lived together with them had a son, Shi Xin, who often borrowed from that branch and had even been involved in litigation with them. This time, the fire first destroyed the stairs, leading to the tragedy. Jiang Zhou, the daughter-in-law of that branch, suspected Shi Xin. She reported this to the Second Sub-Precinct of the Public Security Bureau, which summoned Jiang Shi Xin on the 24th of this month to be questioned, and then transferred him to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. He was then released on bail pending further review.</p>
<p>Provincial Land Bureau Director Inspects Songjiang</p>
<p>Zhu Ping, Director of the Provincial Land Bureau, arrived in Songjiang yesterday. Zhu Zhangqi, Director of the County Land Bureau, greeted him and escorted him to the bureau to inspect it for a week. He expressed his satisfaction. Afterwards, he summoned the team leaders of the land survey teams to address them. He then hired a car to visit Niu Yongjian, the Deputy Director, and Niu Changyao, an instructor, at Yu Tang, for a pleasant conversation. He then proceeded to inspect Bei Qiao in Shanghai County and Nan Qiao in Fengxian County before returning to Shanghai the same day to await a train to return to the province.</p>

<p>Robbery of a Farmhouse Outside the West Gate</p>
<p>Robberies are occurring frequently in this county, especially in the southern villages, but no arrests have been reported. On the morning of the 20th, at approximately 2:00 AM, the Qin family residence in Qin Jia Zhai, Lianxi Self-Governance Experimental Township, just outside the West Gate and very close to the city, was also robbed. The head of the household, Qin Yaojian, is just an ordinary farmer. A gang of more than ten robbers broke through the side door with a large log, brandishing guns and ordering them to remain silent. The householder discovered that one of the guns was made of paper. They entered Yaojian’s and his brother’s bedrooms, conducting a thorough search. Yaojian’s mother, who was sleeping in an adjacent room, opened the door upon hearing the noise and was beaten by the robbers. A bundle of field deeds and pawn tickets was returned to Yaojian at his request to the robbers. The total loss amounted to over one hundred yuan in cash and clothing.</p>

<p>Zhao Zhiping Arrested in Zhejiang</p>
<p>Zhao Zhiping, son of Zhao Yongcai, a Henan native residing in this county, is thirty years old. He graduated from Huzhou Haidao Middle School and has held various positions in the military and political spheres. Later, due to the onset of nervous disorders and mental confusion, and coupled with his aging father's ill health, he resigned and returned home to manage family affairs. Recently, while Zhiping was visiting Xiaoxikou in Anji County, Zhejiang Province, he was suddenly arrested by the local militia, who accused him of irregular behavior. He was transferred to the Zhejiang Provincial Security Office. Zhao Zhiping is originally from Henan but has resided in Wujiang for thirty years. His family is of modest means, and he has always been law-abiding. The sudden arrest has shocked his fellow villagers. They are currently petitioning the Zhejiang authorities for his rescue and release.</p>

<p>Anhui Refugees Rob and Assault People</p>
<p>Recently, Su County, Anhui, has experienced a famine year, resulting in groups of people fleeing the disaster, mostly professional refugees. A group of over 150 refugees from Su County arrived in Wuxi from Changzhou the other day and were lodging in the Yansheng Temple in Lihua Zhuang. The Sixth Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau was notified and immediately dispatched armed police to suppress them. Yesterday morning, at approximately 10:00 AM, the refugees attempted to detour through Zhangshe Hudi to Suzhou when they passed by the Yin Lane area of Chao Yin Township in the Second District. They went to the home of villager Wu Yongquan and forcibly stole two hens and several stones of rice. When the villagers reasoned with them, they were brutally beaten. Tang Wenzhen, the Tu Zheng (local leader), and villagers Wu Juhe and Tang Liangbao were all injured. A man named A Er was also severely beaten by the refugees and is said to have had his spine broken, endangering his life. The injured have been rushed to the hospital for treatment. All the refugees have been intercepted by the Wangting Merchant Corps, pending a report to the county government for processing.</p>
<p>Farmers’ Appeal Regarding Distilling Alcohol</p>
<p>Farmers in the Huadafangzhuang area of Xin’an Township in this county are appealing against the sudden changes in regulations by Zhu Jin, the Director of the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office. Zhu Jin is forcibly designating farmers' by-products as business activities, forcing them to register and pay license taxes. This has led to farmers ceasing operations and collectively appealing. Distilling alcohol from rotten rice and rice mash is a utilization of waste products. Since there are no shops, how can there be license numbers? Without license numbers, how can taxes be levied? Zhu Jin is disregarding past regulations and forcibly levying taxes, which violates the sentiments of the people. According to Article 135 of the new Criminal Code, this should be punished more severely. Yesterday, Xu Shaoshan, Mo Yongsen, and sixteen others drafted seven major reasons and jointly presented them to the County Party Headquarters, requesting a telegram to be sent to the Provincial Party Headquarters, petitioning the Provincial Government to order the Finance Department, which is in charge of tax matters, to instruct the Fourth District Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Bureau to continue to handle matters according to the old regulations in order to pacify the people. Otherwise, over a thousand farming households will have no choice but to file a criminal lawsuit in accordance with the law, and meet Zhu in court, and seek compensation for losses incurred during the shutdown.</p>
<p>Dispute Over Casting a Bronze Statue of a Past Sage</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Yuren, a past sage of this county, was highly respected for his morality and character, and was a specialist in water conservancy research. In the past, he planned the linking of rivers and lakes in this county and the opening of the West Gate Bridge, benefiting the local area. To this day, the entry and exit of lake water benefits the people of the northeast. Local people, in order to commemorate the sage and show respect, initiated a project in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China to cast a bronze statue of Mr. Hu. However, preparations have been delayed until now. During the fifth County Representative Assembly last month, it was resolved to actively prepare for the casting. Regarding the location of the statue, most people advocated placing it in the city park or by the lake. The city park has many visitors and can provide a place for admiration. The lakeside has beautiful scenery and convenient transportation, making it suitable for the viewing of domestic and foreign tourists. Mr. Hu was a water conservancy expert, and his achievements were in water conservancy, making the lakeside a more meaningful place to erect the statue. However, a few people from Yanqiao Township, considering Yanqiao to be Mr. Hu's hometown, insisted on placing the statue in the countryside, which would defeat the purpose of commemorating the sage, resulting in a dispute that has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>Merchant Corps Captures Four Thieves</p>
<p>Wu Weian, the captain of the Thirty-First Brigade of the Donghutang Merchant Corps, led over ten members on patrol in the Yangshuxia area on the morning of the other day, arresting four thieves named Gu Genpei, Zhang Tongfu, Gu Agui, and Chen Jinsheng. Under questioning, they confessed to robbing Gu Guichun's home in November of last year, and Gu Yinsheng's home on October 14th of this year, and using the stolen goods. Yesterday (the 24th), Captain Wu submitted a document to the Merchant Corps Guild, which transferred them to the county government for interrogation.</p>

<p>Drought Relief Association Loans Wheat Seeds</p>
<p>This county has suffered a severe drought this year, with the Sixth District being the hardest hit. Starving people are struggling to survive and have repeatedly engaged in disturbances, further incited by unscrupulous elements. Farmers in Jiepai Township have repeatedly intercepted rice and grain on the way. The Drought Relief Association is paying close attention to this matter and is urging rice merchants to expedite the delivery of the previously agreed-upon wheat seeds. It is now known that all of the seeds have been transported to Changshu, totaling 1,200 shi. The distribution method is as follows: the Sixth District, being the hardest hit, receives 700 dan; the Second District receives 300 dan; and the Fifth District, having purchased their own seeds, receives only 200 dan. After the above plan is approved by the general assembly on the 23rd, it will be distributed to each district for farmers to sow, hoping for a harvest next spring to compensate for their losses.</p>

<p>Further Report on the Poison Pill Case Cracked in Changjing</p>
<p>According to previous reports, a Ning Wan (poison pill) organization was uncovered in Changjing, Jiangyin, and the details are said to be extremely complicated. The Refuse-Ning (meaning refuse opium poppy growing) Association was organized by a small number of people in the town, and the members are not very pure. During the search of Li Ruibao, wife of Shen Yu, a copper plate and empty boxes were found, rumored to be stored by Li Guozhen. At the time, Song Qixiang had a marriage relationship with Shen’s wife, and he happened to be having dinner at her home. The association took the opportunity to arrest him, believing he was related to the poison case, and promptly sent him to the county. There may have been some misunderstandings.</p>

<p>A few days ago, over 400 famine victims from Xiangxiang passed through Shaobo Town in this county, taking the road through Xiannv Temple. They arrived at the home of Ren Xikun in Renjiazhuang in the southern countryside. Ren was the wealthiest man in the village, and the leaders of the famine victims paid a visit to the Ren family, intending to ask for relief. The Ren family, seeing the large number of famine victims, mistook them for robbers and immediately closed the village gate and sounded the gong for help. The Sixth Sub-Precinct of the Public Security Bureau and the Water Patrol Team responded and dispatched teams to the scene.

<p>Water Police Squad Uncovers a Large Bandit Gang</p>
<p>The Yongping gunboat, under the command of the Second Squadron of the Water Police, was dispatched to patrol the ocean on the 18th. At approximately 4:00 PM that afternoon, while patrolling the waters east of Putuo, they suddenly saw two sailboats speeding away. Suspecting their behavior, the gunboat immediately followed them and pursued them to the east and west gates of Xidong Mountain. The ships had already docked at the shore and the people on board were disembarking. Knowing that it was undoubtedly a bandit den, the gunboat immediately radioed the squadron headquarters and requested additional support from the Xinbaoshun patrol boat to encircle and suppress them. However, after searching for two days and nights, no trace of the bandits was found. Later, fishermen revealed that the bandits were hiding in a cave on the coast. The officers fired warning shots near the cave and ordered the bandits to come out, or they would be killed. The bandits, seeing the urgency of the situation and having been besieged for two days and nights, had no power to resist and came out of the cave, surrendering themselves. A total of twenty-one bandits were captured. Two of them jumped into the sea while being bound, leaving nineteen captured. Three refugees were rescued. Eight White Wave brand pistols and ten rifles were seized, along with ammunition. They were sent to the squadron headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Central and Five Other Banks Negotiate Loan to Anhui Province <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Total Loan of 1.2 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Salt Surplus as Guarantee, Three Installments</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government is borrowing a total of 1.2 million yuan from the Central and five other banks in Shanghai. After Director Mao negotiated with the banks in Shanghai, they reconvened at 4:00 PM yesterday and reached an agreement. The contract is being drafted. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Suspension of Treasury Bond Issuance: The Anhui Provincial Treasury has suffered from the impact of the drought, leading to a sharp decline in revenue and a budget deficit. A request was submitted to the Central Government for permission to issue 900,000 yuan in local treasury bonds for the 23rd year of the Republic of China. This was approved, and the regulations were passed by the Legislative Yuan. When Director of Finance Mao Longzhang came to Shanghai this time, he negotiated with various banks. For the sake of procedural convenience, the approved treasury bonds will be suspended from printing and issuing. Instead, a loan will be taken from the banks within the scope of the 900,000 yuan treasury bond principle.</p>
<p>Five Banks Undertake the Loan: The above loan will be guaranteed by the collateral stipulated in the treasury bond regulations, namely, the salt surplus allocated to the province by the Ministry of Finance. After Director Mao negotiated, it was decided that the loan amount would be 800,000 yuan, to be undertaken by the Central, China, Communications, Shanghai, and China Industrial banks. Previously, the Anhui branches of the above five banks had agreed to lend 200,000 yuan to Anhui Province at the end of this lunar year and the Dragon Boat Festival of next lunar year, totaling 400,000 yuan. The above totals 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Re-Meeting: Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the borrowing banks reconvened on the third floor of the Central Bank on the Bund to discuss the Anhui loan. Those present included Mao Longzhang, Director of Finance of Anhui Province, Zhou Shouliang, Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank, Zhang Peishen, Manager of the Communications Bank, and representatives from the Shanghai Bank, the Bank of China, and the China Industrial Bank, totaling six people. They dispersed at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Contract to be Signed: The total Anhui loan is 1.2 million yuan, all for government expenses. The collateral is the salt surplus allocated to the province by the Ministry of Finance. The term is twenty months from the date of the loan disbursement. It was decided to wait until the loan contract is drafted before holding another meeting to formally sign it. In the future, a general contract will be made for the 1.2 million yuan, and Director Mao will send it to Anhui after the contract is signed.</p>
<p>Disbursement Method: The disbursement method is as follows: The issuance of treasury bonds will be changed to a loan of 800,000 yuan, to be fully disbursed by the end of the current Gregorian year. The previously agreed loan of 400,000 yuan will be disbursed in two installments, one for 200,000 yuan at the end of this lunar year, and one for 200,000 yuan at the Dragon Boat Festival of next lunar year. The above disbursements will be made directly by the Anhui branches of the Central, China, Communications, Shanghai, and China Industrial banks to the Anhui Finance Department according to the schedule.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Striving for Lawyers to Attend the Judicial Conference <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Petition from the National Lawyers Association</p>
<p>Telegram from the Shanghai Bar Association</p>
<p>The National Lawyers Association attaches great importance to the Judicial Conference to be convened by the Ministry of Judicial Administration in the spring of next year and advocates that the lawyer community should have representatives to participate in it, so that the judicial authorities can collect thoughts and benefit from wisdom. It is now known that the association's submission to the Ministry of Law states, in brief, that in order to seek improvements in judicial laws and regulations and to renew judicial practice, or in short, to study the increasingly perfect use of judicial power, countries around the world often gather judicial practitioners (including judges and lawyers) and legal experts to hold judicial conferences, and examples of this are too numerous to mention. The United States of America, in light of the exercise of judicial power, should be a continuous effort, and many states have permanent judicial conference institutions, so the importance of judicial conferences can be imagined. The imperfection of our country's judicial organization is undeniable. The fundamental way to improve it is to have each part of the judicial system be able to exert its effectiveness and work together. However, in order to achieve this goal, judicial practitioners from all three positions should each have complex experiences and understandings to jointly seek improvements in the exercise of judicial power. This is what reason and circumstance dictate. If this judicial conference does not have lawyer representatives participating, then the importance of the conference will be reduced, which seems to be a regret. It should be adopted by the Association, and the opinion is said.</p>
<p>Shanghai Lawyers Association telegraphed Minister Ju Juesheng of the Ministry of Judicial Administration yesterday, urging local lawyers associations to send representatives to participate in the judicial conference. The telegram said: Minister Ju Juesheng of the Ministry of Judicial Administration in Nanjing, I admire you very much. However, I checked that this conference did not allow lawyers to participate, which I found strange, because lawyers are members of the judicial system and have a close relationship with the exercise and improvement of judicial power. It seems inappropriate for a country ruled by law to reject them from participating. For this reason, I ask the president of the Lawyers Association to adopt and explicitly allow local lawyers associations to send representatives to participate in the conference and jointly seek improvement. The Shanghai Lawyers Association, Yao,</p>

<p>Turned Back Midway Due to Bad Weather</p>
<p>Portuguese young aviators Lao Baipao and Jiwa departed from Lisbon, Portugal at the end of last month on the Lai He Paide aircraft for a long-distance flight to the Far East, and have arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago. According to a telegram received by the Portuguese Consulate General in this port yesterday morning, the Portuguese aviators left Hong Kong at 7:00 AM yesterday morning to come to Shanghai, and were expected to arrive in Shanghai at 2:00 PM yesterday. Portuguese Consul General Olives, Vice Consul Ba Laika, and representatives of the Portuguese community in Shanghai were all planning to go to Hongqiao Airport for a grand welcome. However, a telegram received yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM stated that when the Portuguese aviators flew to Fuzhou, they turned back to Hong Kong due to bad weather and heavy fog, and landed safely at about 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. As of last night, there was no definite news as to when they will depart for Shanghai again. It will depend on the weather.</p>

According to a telegram received by the representative of the Shanghai British Shipyard, Maer Kang Yangxing, the ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 5:00 PM yesterday. The head office had sent a pilot to Tongsha to wait so that they can guide it to Shanghai. But outside the Wusong Estuary yesterday, the weather was bad and there was heavy fog on the sea. All the sea vessels from the north and south to Shanghai temporarily dropped anchor to wait for the fog to clear before entering the port. The outgoing vessels also temporarily stopped at Sanjia Water, so the Haiheng vessel could not sail to Shanghai yesterday. It will have to wait for the fog to clear today before it can sail into the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Private Postal Offices Must Close by the End of the Year <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The City Government is Ordered to Coordinate with the Post Office for Disposal</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the City Government received an order from the Executive Yuan, which stated, in brief, that postal service is a national monopoly, which is the common practice in countries around the world. China's postal regulations are clearly stipulated, so the existence of private postal offices greatly hinders postal rights. In order to unify the postal service, the Ministry of Communications ordered the Directorate General of Posts in November of the 22nd year of the Republic of China to strictly order private postal offices in the country to gradually cease operations by the end of the 23rd year, and this was repeatedly approved by the Yuan and forwarded to provincial and municipal military and government agencies to assist the post office in cracking down on private postal offices in various places, and to end them all within the specified period. On the one hand, arrangements should be made properly before the deadline expires so that the public does not feel inconvenienced by the cancellation of private postal offices. Therefore, in light of local conditions, detailed studies should be conducted and disposed of separately according to needs, including opening more windows, adding more mail trains, increasing the number of times to collect mailboxes, extending the mail collection time, adding mailboxes and post office agencies, village and town post offices, and expanding village and town delivery, adding postal assistants, clerks, customs enforcement personnel, etc. In the future, after the private postal offices are cancelled when the deadline expires, the public will not feel any inconvenience. Therefore, although the private postal office industry has repeatedly sent representatives to petition for a delay in the ban, the Ministry of Communications believes that private postal offices hinder the government's postal rights, and the ban is inevitable. The deadline is approaching, and we should earnestly coordinate the ban, etc. After receiving the order, the City Government ordered the Social, Public Utility, and Public Security Bureaus to jointly enforce the ban.</p>

<h3 id="e124">This City will Launch a Large-Scale Fundraising to Relieve Disaster Victims in Various Provinces <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Government Initiates Method of Regularly Collecting from Businesses</p>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, this year, various provinces have suffered drought disasters, affecting 369 counties in 11 provinces. The Shanghai Municipal Government believes that the disaster area is vast and the number of disaster victims is large, so it is necessary for the whole country to donate together in order to universally relieve disaster victims. Therefore, it has launched a city-wide general donation method and is scheduled to convene the Municipal Party Department, the Songhu Garrison Command, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Municipal Education Association, and the fundraising association for drought disasters in various provinces next week at the YMCA in Baxianqiao to hold a meeting to explore fundraising methods: (1) Donations from the wealthy (solicited by responsible persons from wealthy gentry), (2) Household donations (five districts, including two special districts, will be donated by household), (3) Student donations (authorities of major and minor schools will solicit donations from students), (4) Scout donations (scouts throughout the city will set out on various roads and solicit donations from passersby in accordance with the method of soliciting air defense donations), (5) Donations from stores, companies, and factories (the Chamber of Commerce will instruct various trade associations to investigate and solicit donations). As for the fundraising for the drought disaster association, Du Yuesheng will also be asked to contact the Yiyuan Greyhound Racecourse in the French Concession to arrange two voluntary greyhound races (one next month and one in January next year, with all profits going to disaster relief). At the same time, Mei Lanfang will be asked to perform to raise funds (Mei is currently performing in Beijing to raise funds). The Lake Society has also decided to perform for two days to help Zhejiang and Hubei.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Declaration of Defection by Three Communists <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Luo Peiguang, Zhang Huifen, Dang Runzhi</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Luo Peiguang, a defecting communist, is a native of Liancheng, Fujian, 26 years old, and a graduate of Great China University. He joined the Communist Party in 1932 and served as a party newspaper editor and C.Y. document officer in the Communist Party's West Shanghai District Committee. Zhang Huifen (female), a native of Yixing, Jiangsu, is 18 years old and a worker at a Shanghai West spinning mill. She joined the Communist Party in 1932 and served as an internal liaison and document custodian for the Communist Party's Jiangsu Provincial Committee. Dang Runzhi (female) is 21 years old, a native of Suide, Shaanxi, and once studied at China University in Peiping. She joined the Communist Party in 1933 and was responsible for distribution work for the Communist Party's Cultural Federation. They have now issued a declaration of defection, stating: In the past, in order to save the crisis of the nation, we did not clearly see the path that should be taken to save the nation, and mistakenly embarked on the path of communism. Subjectively, our spirit was revolutionary, but objectively, we became tools of betrayal. Now we jointly feel that the road of communism is really impossible to take. (1) The Communist Party advocates class struggle, which in fact and theory is a clumsy method of shoe-cutting for China. The class struggle in Marxism can only be suitable for countries with developed capitalism. If it is moved to China, a country with backward production, the result will inevitably be the destruction of national industry and commerce, increase the economic crisis in China, and make the entire nation move towards extinction faster. Therefore, the Communist Party's class struggle is a cruel death knell for China. (2) The nature of the Chinese revolution is still a national revolution, and only the Chinese Kuomintang can undertake and complete this great task. The Communist Party, based on the Third International's erroneous assessment, said that the Chinese revolution has reached the stage of the Soviet revolution, so they blindly organized their Soviet Red Army everywhere and carried out all their disruptive policies, causing widespread bankruptcy in rural areas and unemployment in urban areas. They do not realize their error and reverse the cause and effect, instead placing this responsibility on the Kuomintang and slandering the Kuomintang as a scourge of the country and the people. Facts speak louder than words. Who has been killing and setting fires in the interior in recent years? Who is destroying the entire anti-Japanese plan? We believe that everyone can understand and answer unanimously that the Communist Party is the criminal who destroys China and slaughters farmers and workers. (3) The only revolutionary task in China at present is to oppose the aggression of imperialism and eliminate feudal forces. To complete this arduous combat task, we can only rely on the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang, consolidate the national front, and carry out a broad national revolution. Obviously, the forces of imperialism and feudal warlords in China are very strong. To eliminate them, we can only rely on the united front of all classes and the entire nation to have the confidence of victory. The Communist Party advocates that workers should lead. May I ask, how many industrial workers are there in China with its backward production? According to statistics, there are less than three million industrial workers in China. To complete this arduous task with this extremely small number of workers, only ghosts will believe it. People will not believe it. Therefore, we have thoroughly realized from fact and politics that communism is fundamentally impossible in China. Moreover, in fact, there are more than just the three of us who have realized the same and repented. A large number of Communist Party's lower-level cadres and even the highest-level leaders have surrendered themselves. Now, in addition to firmly turning to the banner of the Three People's Principles and striving to eradicate the Communist Party under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang in order to complete the task of the national revolution, we also sincerely hope that all young people who have been deceived and anesthetized by the Communist Party will also consciously come forward to surrender and accept the generous self-renewal path given to us by the central government.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Salt Administration Suspends Operation of Salt Affairs School <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Reason is to Vigorously Reduce Administration and Cut Expenses</p>
<p>The School was Established Fourteen Years Ago and Had Significant Achievements</p>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, Zhu Tingqi, Director-General of the Salt Affairs Audit Office and concurrently Director of the Salt Affairs Administration, submitted a request yesterday to suspend the operation of the Salt Affairs School. The Salt Affairs School was established in 1920 and has a history of 14 years to date. It is the only place in our country for advanced training of specialized salt affairs personnel. At a time when salt affairs are in need of reform and the government is promoting vocational education, the salt affairs authorities are actually suspending the school on the grounds of vigorously reducing administration and cutting expenses. It is a pity. The original text is excerpted as follows: "According to the Salt Affairs School's submission, regarding whether or not to continue recruiting new students in the second half of this year, please give instructions. The school was established in 1920 and was originally established to train specialized salt affairs personnel. Each year, graduates are successively distributed and employed in various salt affairs agencies. In August of last year, due to the rigorous reduction of administration and cutting of expenses in the various administrative agencies under this office, the amount was very large. If students from the school continue to graduate in the future, it will inevitably increase expenses and affect the budget. After detailed deliberation, the recruitment of new students was stopped in the second half of last year. Now, according to the submitted statement, this office re-examines the current situation. Universities in the country are becoming increasingly complete in their departments, and there are many people with expertise in public document processing and examination subjects who can be recruited and employed. It does not seem necessary to establish a special school. Furthermore, the school's expenses were originally priced by the Tuoqing Gaoxian Railway Company as a regular expense from November 1928, as instructed by the Ministry. Later, due to the company's poor business, it was unable to allocate funds as planned. The Ministry then approved a temporary allocation of 4,800 yuan per month by the Changlu Audit Branch, which was directly transferred to the school for use from January 1932 until now. This allocation is temporary in nature, and the amount allocated over the years is considerable. The Changlu salt funds are currently being reorganized, and it seems that savings should be planned in advance to prepare for future contributions. Based on the above reasons, it is proposed that after the school's current third-year and original second-year classes graduate (the third-year class will graduate in the first half of this year, and the second-year class will graduate in the first half of next year), the school should be closed to conclude operations. Before the closure, it is proposed to reduce the school's 1934 expenses to 3,000 yuan per month, which will still be allocated monthly by the Changlu Audit Office. In addition to the school's request regarding whether to recruit students in the second half of this year, it is proposed that this office instruct to stop recruiting students from the second half of this year. The reasons for the school's planned closure by the first half of 1935 are presented in writing for your review."</p>

<p>Sent to Members of the Industrial and Commercial Regulations Committee for Signing and Giving Opinions</p>
<p>Regarding the case of sanctioning businesses in the same trade that do not join the guild, the trade guilds in this city have consistently striven for it, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Industry of the Legislative Yuan, etc., requesting the formulation of sanctions measures to strengthen the organization of trade unions, but has not yet received government approval. Therefore, the public is anxious and has requested the Chamber of Commerce to reconsider the matter and submit another petition for relief. It is understood that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has specifically submitted the case to the Industrial and Commercial Regulations Committee for study. The members of the Regulations Committee, Li Wenjie, Sun Xiaolou, and Xi Yushu, have now drafted a copy and submitted it to all members of the Regulations Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to sign and comment on each article in order to summarize and handle it.</p>

<p>The Pudong Electric Company has been actively constructing and expanding in recent years. In addition to the areas along the Pudong River belonging to Shanghai Municipality, including Gaoqiao, Gaohang, Luhang, Yangjing, Tangqiao, Yangsi, and the Sixth District, as well as Sanlin and Chenhang in the Shanghai County, where poles and wires have long been installed and electricity is widely supplied, they have also been gradually expanding to the neighboring Nanhui and Chuansha counties. For example, Beicai, Zhangjiangzha, the Fujia Catholic Church, Chen Tuiguan Bridge, Sun Xiaoqiao, Hengmian, etc., in the Fourth District of Nanhui County, and Tangmu Bridge Town in Chuansha County, are supplied wholesale to the Huibei Electric Company, which then distributes it retail. The Daming Electric Company in the Fifth District of Nanhui County also ceased generating electricity in February of this year and contracted with Pudong Electric to purchase electricity for use by households in Zhoupu Town. Recently, the company plans to extend high-voltage transmission lines southward from Zhoupu Town, reaching the towns of Xiasha and Hangtou in the Sixth District. Electricity is expected to be available next month. Within the Sixth District, there are also towns such as Zhaojialou, Dujiahang, and Lujiahui, each with small power plants that are operating poorly. They are currently discussing cooperation methods with the company, aiming to switch to Pudong Electric for power supply. The original Nansha Electric Light Company in Nanhui County has recently expanded its capital and reorganized into the Nanhui Electric Company. They are also negotiating with Pudong Electric to purchase electricity, and an agreement has been reached. It is planned to extend a three-phase high-voltage 13,200-volt transmission line eastward from Hangtou Town, passing through Xinshichang Town and reaching the county seat directly, before extending south to Liuzaowan Town. It is reported that construction will be completed and electricity will be available within two months, providing day and night supply, which will be more convenient for users. General industry and commerce can also gradually see revitalization. The electricity can also be used for rural irrigation along the line, benefiting the local economy significantly.</p>

<h3 id="e132">French Concession Interpreter Extorts Money from Gu Songmao <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Arrested After Discovery by the Detective Bureau</p>
<p>Captured After Returning from Escape</p>
<p>Huang Ruiting, a native of Ningbo, is currently thirty-three years old. In 1920, he joined the Traffic Department of the French Municipal Council as an interpreter. On September 10, 1933, Huang falsely claimed to Gu Songmao, a major rickshaw merchant, that the French Municipal Council's inspection of rickshaws was extremely strict. If he could be given a considerable sum of money, he could use his influence to provide special treatment and avoid harsh scrutiny. Gu agreed and paid him 670 yuan in foreign currency. Gu issued a check from the Jifeng Qianzhuang and delivered it to Huang at Gu's residence at No. 15 Hemin Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei. Huang then affixed his seal and obtained the money from Jifeng. However, the matter was discovered by the Chief Inspectorate of the Detective Bureau, who ordered detectives to arrest him. However, Huang had already abandoned his post and fled. The Detective Bureau reported to the First Special District Court and issued Arrest Warrant No. 490. Recently, Huang, believing that the matter had passed, secretly returned to Shanghai and hid at No. 2, Lane 111, Oujia Road, Hongkou. This was discovered by the Chief Inspectorate, and Chief Detective Lu Liankui ordered Chinese Detective Liu Zhaokui, Detective Wu Hanzhang, Zhang Yunhong, and Western Detective Grover to arrest Huang at his home at 1:45 PM yesterday, and he was taken back to the Detective Bureau for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Detective Bureau's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the background and charged Huang with extortion under Article 363 of the Criminal Code. He also stated that due to the urgency of the situation, the plaintiff, Gu Songmao, and witnesses Bao Zenghuang, Tao Bengong, Yin Zhifang, Liang Ruiting, and Hou Shao'an, had not been summoned and were unable to appear in court. Therefore, he requested that the case be rescheduled for hearing and submitted a photograph of the check as evidence to the court. Huang Ruiting argued that Gu Songmao had borrowed 2,500 yuan from him in June of the previous year, and that this 670 yuan was part of the repayment of his debt, not extortion. He also claimed that he had no authority to inspect vehicles, as that was the responsibility of Western supervisors. He hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Judge Deng Baosun reviewed the evidence and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Zeng Mengpu Talks About Sai Jinhua <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Mengpu Was Only Thirteen When Sai Married Hong Jun</p>
<p>"A Flower in a Sinful Sea" Was Written to Preserve Late Qing Anecdotes</p>
<p>Sai's Statements in Beijing Are Factually Incorrect</p>
<p>Recently, this newspaper published a dispatch from Beijing, recording the impressions and statements of the famous late Qing courtesan Sai Jinhua. The article mentioned "A Flower in a Sinful Sea," which was said to have changed Sai's name, and Sai Jinhua claimed that Zeng Pu wrote the book because of setbacks in love. This is truly an extraordinary and sensational anecdote in literary circles. Fortunately, both Ms. Sai and Mr. Zeng Pu are still alive, so it is not difficult to clarify the truth. Especially fortunate is that this reporter has a friendship with Mr. Zeng Pu despite the difference in age, so on a starry, moonlit, and chilly early winter night, I drove to Shanghai to visit him at his residence. Mr. Zeng Pu, whose courtesy name is Mengpu, is from Changshu, Jiangsu. In his youth, he was involved in officialdom and made many achievements in political circles. In recent years, he has retired to cultivate his garden, entertaining himself with flowers in his hometown's Xuxiao Garden in Changshu. In his spare time, he translates famous works of French and Russian literature to enjoy his later years. Every autumn and winter, he comes to Shanghai for a short stay to visit old friends and take care of miscellaneous affairs. This reporter was able to visit Mr. Zeng Pu during his short stay in Shanghai. Mr. Zeng is already sixty-three years old. His health is not very good, but his spirit is vigorous and his arguments are lively, and his enthusiasm is no less than that of a young person. Mr. Zeng has a long, thin face, a drooping beard, wears a blue coarse cloth gown, a white-topped melon-skin hat, and white shoes, mourning for his late mother. After a brief exchange of greetings, the reporter presented Mr. Zeng with the Shen Bao dispatch, asking for his criticism and thoughts on the matter. Mr. Zeng smiled and said, "This is probably because the reporter misunderstood Ms. Sai's words, or else it was intentionally fabricated. As far as I can tell, Ms. Sai would never say that I had a romantic relationship with her, because there is absolutely no such fact between us. In order to dispel misunderstandings from the outside world, I will briefly describe my relationship with Ms. Sai and the motivation for creating 'A Flower in a Sinful Sea.'"</p>
<p>(1) Sai Jinhua's Life and Relationship with Me</p>
<p>Sai Jinhua is originally from Yancheng. She claims to be from Suzhou. At the age of sixteen, she married Hong Jun, whose courtesy name is Wenqing, who was my father's sworn brother and also the teacher of my teacher. Therefore, we had the relationship of "Grand Teacher." Therefore, at that time, I often called Sai Jinhua "Little Grand Teacher's Wife." Sai married Hong Wenqing when she was sixteen years old, and I was only thirteen years old. How could I understand what love was? This is not just me saying it. There is documentary evidence. I currently have Mr. Yuan Shuangqiu's "Chang'an Banxi Poetry Collection." According to the collection, it was written in the year of Dinghai during the Guangxu reign. In this collection, before the poem "Sending Li Chunzhai, Observer, as Special Envoy to Japan," there is a poem titled "Sending Hong Wenqing, Academician, as Envoy to Russia and Germany," which is the poem in "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" that says, "Proclaim the imperial decree to the western sea, and present the heavenly book to the northern court." Wenqing originally went abroad as an envoy with Li Chunzhai and Xue Fucheng. According to this, the year of Wenqing's mission abroad was indeed Dinghai, and I was sixteen years old that year. Sai Jinhua's marriage to Wenqing was two or three years before the mission abroad, in the years of Jiashen or Yiyou during the Guangxu reign. The "Colorful Clouds Song" in the Fashan Poetry Collection states that Caiyun was sixteen years old when she married Wenqing, and I was only thirteen years old that year. Even if we push it down another year, I would be at most fourteen years old. How could there have been a relationship with Sai that involved recognizing and even falling in love with her? I first met Sai in Beijing. At that time, I was a secretary in the cabinet and often went in and out of Hong's residence, so I often saw her. At that time, Sai was very graceful and her eyes were bright. Even if she didn't speak, her eyes seemed to convey something, as if she were speaking. For example, when eating at the same table, if there were ten people, Sai could use her hands, eyes, and mouth to make all ten people feel very happy and satisfied. In other words, she would never neglect anyone. Sai was not a beauty with the appearance of the goddess Luo, but her face was upright. She was informal and didn't care about trivial matters, and she got acquainted with people very easily. When I met Sai, she was about twenty-seven or eight years old, wearing an embroidered dress and wearing the then-popular beard hairstyle. She had already returned from accompanying Hong on a mission to Western Europe. The Jiji collection of the Chang'an Banxi Poetry Collection was written in the year of Guihai. Among them, there is a poem titled "Between the Congling Snow Mountains, the Boundary Affairs Are Undetermined, Yang Yushang, the Attendant, Declares and Governs, and Enthusiastically Asks to Go, Jocularly Writing a Poem to Amuse Him." The so-called boundary affairs between the Congling Snow Mountains were due to the border issues that arose from Wenqing's Sino-Russian border map. Imperial Censor Yang was the one who impeached Wenqing and led the mission to survey the border. Later, Wenqing's affairs were also mediated by him. However, Wenqing soon died of depression because of this case, approximately in the autumn and winter of that year. Because the Hong family returned south in Jiawu, Sai Jinhua escaped from the ship at this time and broke away from the Hong family. She started a business in Shanghai under the name Cao Menglan. Suzhou gentry, because Sai lost the face of Suzhou people, Lu Runxiang and other gentry forced her to leave Shanghai. Therefore, Sai went north to Tianjin and again used the name Sai Jinhua. Sai had an affair with General Waldersee when she accompanied Hong on a mission to Germany. Therefore, when the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing, Waldersee looked for her. Sai went to Beijing at Waldersee's invitation and still used the name Sai Jinhua. She accompanied Waldersee day and night, riding a horse and swaggering through the city, becoming extremely popular. The citizens of Beijing called her "Second Master Sai." When Waldersee returned to Germany, Sai was imprisoned in the Ministry of Justice for beating a maid to death. Her fellow prisoners included the revolutionary Shen XX (the protagonist of the Shanghai Subao case) and the old bureaucrat Su Yuanchun (who personally participated in the battle at Zhennanguan during the Sino-French War), known as the "Three Famous Prisoners." Later, she was sent by the Ministry of Justice to Suzhou, Changzhou, Yuanhe, and Wu County for a joint trial. Someone helped her from the inside, so she was released. She started a business again in Shanghai, still under the name Sai Jinhua. Later, she married Cao, a small clerk on the Jinpu Railway. Their relationship was very good until Cao died. She set up a business in Shanghai for the third time, next to the Grand Theater, still under the name Sai Jinhua. She met Congressman Wei, whom she married. She was about fifty years old at the time, around 1934. The last time I met Sai was at this time. Sai's spirit was still good, but she wore a lot of powder, and you could see that her skin was wrinkled. She liked to wear men's clothing. Regarding "A Flower in a Sinful Sea," Sai raised two protests: (1) She did not admit to being the daughter of a sedan chair carrier; (2) She did not admit to having a relationship with the captain during her voyage to Europe. She did not mention anything else. Sai did know foreign languages, at least she could speak English, French, and German. She did not know how to write. It is too much to say that she did not understand a single foreign language. Think about it, Sai had two close relationships with Waldersee, and the time was not just three or two days. How could she not understand a single word of German?</p>
<p>(2) The Motivation and Process of Creating "A Flower in a Sinful Sea"</p>
<p>Sai Jinhua said that I wrote "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" because of failures in love. I have already pointed out the fallacy in the above conversation. Now I will briefly describe my motivation for writing "A Flower in a Sinful Sea." In 1904, I recuperated in Shanghai due to illness and founded the Xiaoshuo Lin Publishing House in Shanghai. Jin Yi (courtesy name Songcen) from Suzhou submitted a manuscript entitled "A Flower in a Sinful Sea," consisting of six chapters. I revised it and wrote to him suggesting that we use Sai Jinhua as the warp and the anecdotes of the Qing Dynasty's court and the public during the past thirty years as the weft to compile a long novel. Jin Yi replied that he did not have such ambition, so he completely entrusted it to me. Therefore, the first chapter of the first edition of "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" was still written by Jin Yi. After I finished the first volume of "A Flower in a Sinful Sea," my father-in-law, Shen Meisun, saw it. Because the content was all about the anecdotes of seniors and friends, he was afraid that I would offend relatives and friends, so he hid it and did not allow it to be published. However, because this was the crystallization of my efforts, I was unwilling to bury it, so I took the opportunity to secretly print it. That was in 1906. In the preface to "The History of Bandits," Lin Qinnan revealed that "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" was written by Zeng Pu. For a time, many people contacted me to inquire about it. As for the content of "A Flower in a Sinful Sea," it is as Lin Qinnan said in the preface to "The Red Reef Painting Oar Record": "A Flower in a Sinful Sea is not a novel, but a history of thirty years." However, although there may be a considerable target when writing the novel, it is too ignorant of literary works to regard it as a true history and stick to it inch by inch.</p>

<p>Seeking Funds to Return Home to Visit Her Mother</p>
<p>Replying Letter Was Reproachful by Her Husband</p>
<p>Zhang Meizhen, a woman from Hebei, is seventeen years old this year and married Hu Muxiu from Zhejiang as a concubine. Hu is a military man and currently serves as a staff officer in the Eighth Brigade Headquarters of the Third Division of the Army in Fujian. He left Ms. Zhang in Shanghai, living in the back room of a three-story building at No. 22 Hengqing Lane, Bellows Road, in the French Concession. All living expenses are remitted by Hu on a monthly basis. Recently, Meizhen received a letter that her mother in Yichang was seriously ill and urgently wanted to visit her, but she had no travel expenses. Therefore, she sent a letter to her husband, Hu Muxiu, requesting funds to visit her sick mother in Yichang. Unexpectedly, at around 1:00 PM on the 23rd, Meizhen received a reply letter from her husband sent by the post office. Upon opening the letter, not only was the request for money refused, but there were also words of reproach. Upon seeing the letter, Meizhen was filled with anger and sorrow, and burst into tears. After her roommates persuaded her to stop, she conceived the idea of suicide. She went out to buy sleeping pills and returned home, taking them while lying in bed waiting for death. At 7:00 PM, Zhang Mianren, a friend of her husband from Zhejiang living in the front room (who works at the Shanghai Art School on Caishi Road), discovered that she was calling out but unable to wake up. At 9:30 PM, he sent her to Baolong Hospital for emergency treatment. However, the poisoning was too deep and the treatment was ineffective. She died at noon yesterday. The hospital reported the suicide situation to the Xinzha Police Station, which in turn notified the French Police Station to send detective Maye to investigate the suicide. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Forensic Center for examination. Because today is a Sunday holiday, they are waiting to report to the Second Special District Court tomorrow to send someone to examine the body. At the same time, the second landlord telegraphed the deceased's husband to handle the funeral arrangements.</p>

<p>Crew Members Raise Money to Assist</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Yangtze River steamer Jiangxin, which sailed from Hankou to Shanghai this time, stopped at Jiujiang on the 22nd to load and unload passengers and cargo before setting sail again. Unexpectedly, no more than half a mile after the ship started, a passenger nearing 60 years old in the third-class cabin suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, the ship's tea boy and sailors spotted him and immediately reported to the captain to stop the ship. They quickly lowered a sampan and sent sailors to rescue him. Unexpectedly, the person who fell into the water was well-versed in swimming. Although he jumped into the water to commit suicide, he was also waiting for someone to help him. After being rescued from the water and brought onto the ship, the crew and the business director removed his wet clothes, provided him with food and medicinal wine, and asked him about the reasons for his suicide. According to the passenger, he was from Wuxue and was unable to borrow money from a friend in Wuhu due to difficult livelihood. He returned to Jiujiang, and now thinking that he had no way to make a living, he voluntarily took the steamer and jumped into the river to commit suicide. Whether this matter is true or not cannot be verified, but the crew members on the ship immediately raised more than 100 yuan to give to the passenger and sent him to Wuhu, which he wanted to go to, allowing him to go ashore.</p>

<p>Wang Zongying Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>On the morning of the 22nd of this month at 9:30 AM, the Cantonese Gan Zhu Pan family at No. 690 Broadway Road suddenly received a threatening letter from a bandit group demanding 500 yuan, otherwise they would take drastic measures. They also received a phone call instructing them to wrap the money in white paper and have someone wearing a blue cloth long gown send it to the entrance of the Xihua Road Post Office between 8:00 and 9:00 AM the next morning, where someone would come to meet them. The victim replied that the amount of money demanded was too large, and the result was reduced to 100 yuan. They immediately reported to the Huishan Police Station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to secretly monitor the situation at the appointed time. They wrapped the money in paper to resemble 100 yuan, and the representative wearing the blue long gown waited for a long time at the agreed location, but no one came to talk. At around 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, Wang Zongying, a man from Jiangbei, 20 years old, suddenly came to the victim's door with a letter in his hand, lingering. He was spotted by the lane watchman, Wei Shu, who learned that he was asked by a small Ningbo person to deliver the letter to the Gan residence and bring back 100 yuan. He was arrested by Chinese detective Chen Baozhong of the police station, and the letter was taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Municipal Council lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated the previous situation and requested an adjournment. He presented the two letters for inspection. When questioned, the defendant's confession was hesitant. Judge Xiao Xiexun ordered him to be detained and remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Death by Playing with Electrical Wires <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Mao Lingen Dies from Curiosity</p>
<p>Cao Amao, a resident of No. 4 Yaotun Bay, north of Xietu Road, who works as a craftsman in the Da Zhonghua Overshoe Factory, hired an electrician to install electric lights at his home the day before yesterday. At around 5:00 PM, Mao Lingen (27 years old), a friend of Cao from Haimen, came to Cao's house to talk to Cao. At that time, the wires had not yet been installed. Unexpectedly, Mao's curiosity arose, and he stepped forward and grabbed the wires with his hand. Unexpectedly, he was immediately electrocuted. By the time the electrician noticed and rushed to rescue him, it was too late, and he died immediately. Yesterday, the police station ordered Cao Zhongqing, the local guarantor of the 27th Bao, 4th Tu, to report to the local court for an autopsy. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Zhang Zi, entrusted by the court, arrived at the scene with Examiner Xuan Zhiming to confirm that the death was caused by electrocution. He filled out the form and ordered the coffin to be buried pending further instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Accomplice in Assassination Case, Gu Qingbao, Arrested <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Detective Bureau Reports the Incident of Jiang Guoxing's Death</p>
<p>Gu Was Present at the Scene and Was Also a Conspirator</p>
<p>On the afternoon of January 29th last year at 5:30 PM, an assassination case occurred at Yuanfang Lane, Huaji Road, Hongkou. The deceased was named Jiang Guoxing, who specialized in being an informant. If he learned that there were contraband items somewhere, he would report to the police or detectives, which led to him being resented by others and assassinated. After the incident, the police arrested the perpetrators Gu Hairu, Ge Xiaosuo, Ji Xiaobao, Miao Zuobi, Mizukami Ko, and others, and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Gu and others confessed that there was also a co-conspirator in this case, Gu Qingbao (also known as Gu Aqing or Chen Aqing), who was at large. As a result, Gu Hairu was sentenced to life imprisonment, Ge Xiaosuo was sentenced to death, and the others were also punished separately. Later, Gu and Ge declared that they were not convinced and filed an appeal. After the Court of Appeal changed the sentence to 15 years for Gu and life imprisonment for Ge, they were sent to prison for execution. At the same time, the police reported to the court and obtained an arrest warrant for Gu. Two years have passed since the incident, and until yesterday afternoon, the Chinese detective of the Putuo Road Police Station learned that Gu Qingbao had returned to Shanghai and was currently eating at a restaurant in Xuejia浜, Limadu, Nanshi. They then joined the police detectives of the Nanshi Public Security Bureau to arrest Gu Qingbao and take him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court and charged with premeditated murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Code. According to the Detective Bureau lawyer Zhang Tianyin, who stood up and stated the case, after Jiang Guoxing was killed, the police arrested the perpetrators Gu Hairu, Ge Xiaosuo, and others. According to Gu's previous confession at the police station, in detail, he said that at that time, in addition to him, there were Ge Xiaosuo, Chen Dacheng, and Gu Qingbao, who were waiting in Yuanfang Lane. When they saw Jiang passing by, Chen and Ge suddenly stepped forward and first knocked Jiang down with their fists. Ge then chopped him several times with a sharp axe, but Jiang still did not die. Therefore, Chen Dacheng opened fire on him twice with a pistol, and Chen also fired one shot. Jiang then died. The defendant in this case, Gu Qingbao, in addition to being at the scene at the time, was also a co-conspirator in the prior discussion. There is also a witness, He Jiaji, who was at the scene when the incident occurred. He can prove that the defendant Gu Qingbao was the first to shout "Hit!" "Hit!" Chen and Ge then immediately took action. The Detective Bureau detectives went to He's house at No. 14 Yuanfang Lane, Huaji Road, yesterday to inquire, but He was out. They instructed his father to inform He Jiaji to appear in court today to testify, but it is suspected that he was threatened by the defendant and dared not appear in court. Therefore, the court is requested to issue a ticket ordering him to be summoned. Moreover, the Detective Bureau still needs to investigate evidence in this case, and the trial should be adjourned. Then, Jiang Lu, the wife of the victim, and He Jiaji's father reported the case and testified. When questioned, the defendant denied that he had conspired to commit murder. He only claimed that Jiang Guoxing had always known him and hated him. Since Jiang was killed, because there was a Western detective from the police station investigating at his home, he dared not go back and went to Chongqing to do business. After returning to Shanghai, he still lived in his home at No. 43 Yuanfang Lane. He hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the confession and ordered Gu to be detained for further investigation in seven days.</p>

<p>The case regarding the reconsideration of Article 239 of the Criminal Code, which has attracted social attention, was resolved by the Legislative Yuan at its regular meeting on the 23rd to be submitted to the Criminal Law Committee and the Legal System Committee for review. It is reported that the Chinese Women's Movement League, the Shanghai Women's Advancement Association, the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, and the Chinese Women's Society of this city believe that the Legislative Yuan intends to delay the matter. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, they convened a joint emergency meeting and resolved to send representatives to unite women from various regions, organize an expanded petition group, appeal to the capital, and re-issue a circular telegram to women's groups and female compatriots across the country. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>To all national women's groups, female schools, and 200 million female compatriots: We hereby inform you that the amendment to Article 239 of the Criminal Code has already been resolved by the Central Political Council and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. Our women's groups have repeatedly submitted petitions stating the reasons in the past. Unexpectedly, at the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting this Friday, it was decided to use the delaying tactic of submitting it for review and shelving it. The news of this has caused us great consternation. How can such a law that violates the teachings of the late Premier and overturns the prestige of the New Life Movement be allowed to exist under the banner of the Blue Sky with a White Sun? Our associations, etc., have decided to immediately send representatives to various cities and counties across the country to jointly organize a petition group, travel to the capital as quickly as possible, and expand the movement. Our female compatriots should immediately rise up in unison, redouble their efforts, and with a resolute spirit and orderly steps, vow to fight to the death to eliminate this feudal legacy. We will never give up until our goal is achieved. The time is pressing, and there is no time to delay. This is a one-time opportunity. Please be aware of this.

Now, because the chemical test results of the confiscated drugs show that there are no toxic substances, he has been released. However, he was innocently imprisoned for more than two weeks, which has greatly affected his business. Therefore, an extraordinary meeting of member representatives was convened to discuss the matter. It was unanimously believed that being detained without being allowed bail after being falsely accused is too insecure. It was resolved that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce should be requested to forward a request to the municipal government, urging it to instruct the Public Security and Health Bureaus to recognize those who have obtained a pharmaceutical merchant license from the Health Bureau as legitimate pharmacies in the future when such unexpected events occur, and allow the association to provide guarantees to avoid innocent people from being implicated. We are hereby recording this case and forwarding it to you. Please grant us permission to forward it.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Notes on the Personnel Management Association's Speech <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>In order to promote the study of personnel management issues, the Personnel Management Association stipulates that a lecture meeting will be held once a month, inviting experts to give lectures. It is learned that the association held its second lecture meeting yesterday at the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge, inviting Mr. Huang Renzhi, director of the China Vocational Education Society and general secretary of the Shanghai Local Association, to speak on the issue of "How to Prevent Embezzlement by Industrial and Commercial Employees." More than 60 directors, members, and students of the training institute attended. First, Dr. He Qingru delivered the opening speech, followed by Mr. Huang's speech. The main points of his speech were: (1) Preventing embezzlement from a business perspective is not as effective as preventing it from outside the business. Individual conversations and attention to leisure issues can be utilized. (2) Relying on leaders' speeches to prevent embezzlement is not as effective as relying on colleagues' mutual admonitions. Pay attention to the friends with whom employees associate and strictly control small group organizations. (3) Relying on rules and regulations to prevent embezzlement is not as effective as relying on personal influence. Leaders must set an example in every word and deed, etc. His words were weighty, pertinent, and practical, truly a product of experience. The listeners benefited greatly.</p>

<p>Fortunately Extinguished by Invincible Fire Extinguishers</p>
<p>The Shanghai 6th National Goods Movement Exhibition, organized by the Social Bureau of Ponglai Road in this city, has been exceptionally popular since its opening, with no fewer than 20,000 to 30,000 visitors each day. The organizers of the exhibition site were very thorough in preparing for fire prevention in advance, using Invincible brand fire extinguishers produced by the Family Industries Society for all their preparations. At around 2 p.m. on the 23rd, the Xie Xing Factory in the exhibition site suddenly caught fire. Fortunately, the shop employees immediately used Invincible brand fire extinguishers to vigorously fight the fire, and it was extinguished within a few minutes, preventing a major disaster. The association believed that the Invincible brand fire extinguishers were very effective and had preserved a great deal during this fire. It was truly admirable, and a public letter was immediately prepared and sent to the company yesterday to express its gratitude.</p>

<p>Discovered by Director Guan Gong</p>
<p>Recently, a young man named Zeng Zhongkai, due to prolonged unemployment and economic hardship, had the far-fetched idea of forging introduction letters from Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, and Yu Jishi, Li Mo'an, Qian Dajun, and other important figures from the Zhejiang Security Department, to swindle in Shanghai. This was quite active. However, Zeng Yangfu learned of the matter, so he telegraphed Mayor Wu Tiecheng, ordering all subordinate agencies to pay attention to investigating and arresting him. The other day, Zeng Zhongkai brought an introduction letter from Zeng Kuangqing, Director of the Political Training Department of the Peiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission, to visit Director Guan Gong of the 16th Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and falsely requested a job introduction to borrow money. Director Guan, because he knew Zeng Kuangqing well, realized that the letter was forged. He immediately detained him and, after inquiring by telegram, confirmed that Director Zeng had indeed not written the letter of introduction. He then prepared a document yesterday morning to send Zeng Zhongkai to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e151">New Trick for Swindling Pewter Wine Pots <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Wang Awei Scammed More Than 500</p>
<p>Owner of the receiving shop and four others detained</p>
<p>Wang Awei, a rogue, 28 years old, from Ningbo, recently had a far-fetched idea and roamed the streets, falsely claiming to be a resident of a certain number on a certain road to large and small hotels in the city, and requested that several catties of Shaoxing wine be delivered immediately. The hotels, because the customers were coming to their door, all agreed and immediately sent their staff to deliver the Shaoxing wine they wanted in pewter wine pots to the designated location. Unexpectedly, Wang was already standing at the doorstep of his so-called house number. When he saw the wine staff coming, he immediately greeted them and said, "I still need several catties of Shaoxing wine now. Please go back to the shop and bring it to add to the Shaoxing wine you brought, and you can give it to me to take inside. Hurry, don't delay," etc. At this time, the wine staff did not suspect him of fraud, so they all handed over the wine pots they were carrying to Wang to take inside, and returned to the shop to add more wine. Unexpectedly, when they brought the wine for the second time, Wang had already fled without a trace. When they asked the residents, they all said that they had not sent anyone to call for wine. At this point, the wine staff realized that they had been deceived. They immediately returned to the shop and reported to their master, to no avail. Moreover, because Wang's scam was ingenious, the number of hotels in the city that had been deceived by him had reached hundreds, and Wang had successively scammed more than 500 pewter wine pots, which he sold cheaply to Wan Tai Copper and Tin, etc., at No. 1657 Fangbang Road to melt down into pewterware. As for the Shaoxing wine, it was all sold to rickshaw pullers for drinking. Wang made a great profit, so he made a living from it. Unexpectedly, at around 10 a.m. yesterday, Wang went to a certain place again and scammed two wine pots. When he passed near Fangbang Bridge, he was suddenly discovered by Chen Caifu, Dong Wenrui, leaders of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and detectives Zhao Huai'ren, Li Ruizhi, etc., who were patrolling. They searched him and found the stolen goods, and took him back to the team. Captain Lu interrogated him and learned the whole story. He immediately sent Chen and others to Wan Tai, Yuan Yuan, Yuan Yichang, and other copper and tin shops to recover dozens of stolen pewter wine pots, and detained four people: Lu Deyou, owner of Wan Tai, Li Zhifang, a shop assistant, Wang Yueting, owner of Yuan Yuan, and Yuan Yiji, owner of Yuan Yichang. They were all taken to the team and sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e152">The Past Love and Separation of Lin Yujin and Sheng Yuchang <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Lin was first a prostitute and then a dancer</p>
<p>Reunited after separation, then abandoned again</p>
<p>Sheng Yuchang, 38 years old this year, the eldest grandson of Sheng Xingsun, former Qing Dynasty Grand Guardian and Minister of Posts and Communications, from Changzhou, resides at No. 1 Avenue Petain in the French Concession. He previously lived with Yan Shuangqin, the second daughter of Yan Minghan, a local Taoist priest living on Kang Nao Road in West Shanghai, due to love. Later, because the woman's brother-in-law, Zheng Shifan, was involved in a kidnapping case and arrested, the two people's feelings broke down and they separated. The woman's parents, as legal representatives, accompanied the woman and hired a lawyer to sue Sheng Yuchang for abandonment in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. After several summonses, Sheng finally agreed to an unconditional reconciliation on July 26 of last year, restored the old relationship, and lived together again. The case was then closed. Recently, a Guangdong woman, Lin Yujin (27 years old this year, residing at No. 16 Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road), hired a lawyer and filed a complaint in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court accusing Sheng Yuchang of abandonment. The court, according to the complaint, scheduled a summons for all parties yesterday, as was briefly recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Here is a supplementary record of the intention and reasons for the prosecution. Lin Yujin was a prostitute in Changsan Shuyu in her early years, under the name Xin Yujin. At the age of 16, she was introduced by Su Shichi and married Sheng Yuchang as a concubine, the fourth concubine. They lived together in Zhabei Wuzhen Road, Seymour Road Baochang Lane, etc. They got along for two years. Because Sheng kept many concubines and was not devoted to his affections, he initially doted on Miss Lin, but then listened to the slander of other concubines and treated her cruelly, punching and kicking her as usual. Sheng then forced her to sign a statement of disassociation and drove her out of the house without giving her a penny. Miss Lin sighed at her misfortune and did not want to argue with him, so she left and became a dancer in a Shanghai dance hall to make a living. Unexpectedly, she met Sheng again in the dance hall. Sheng, seeing Miss Lin hugging and dancing with others, was concerned about his reputation, so he called Miss Lin to him, gave her 200 yuan, and told her not to work as a dancer in the future, and promised to give her 300 yuan a month for living expenses from then on. Since then, Lin Yujin lived with Sheng again, renting a house at No. 291 Renhe Lane, Avenue Joffre, upstairs from the Jinhua Pharmacy. Lin was overjoyed to have found someone to rely on for the rest of her life. However, Lin suffered from lung disease, and Sheng, although he had a heart of love, was afraid of contracting lung disease, so he gradually became cold towards her again. From April of this year, he stopped providing living expenses and abandoned her. Lin visited him several times, but it was difficult to see him because Sheng's residence was like a sea. At this point, Lin believed that Sheng had deliberately abandoned her, so she filed a complaint, requesting that he be interrogated in accordance with Article 310 of the Criminal Code, and also filed a civil lawsuit, requesting that he be ordered to pay 50,000 yuan in alimony. The court, according to the complaint, issued a summons and sent a police officer to deliver it to the defendant. His family replied that Sheng was in Hangzhou, so they refused to accept the summons. At 10 a.m. yesterday, Judge Xiong Huiping and clerk Zheng Rong arrived at the Sixth Court for trial. The defendant did not appoint a lawyer to attend on his behalf, only the plaintiff Lin Yujin and her lawyer attended. After briefly stating the case, the judge announced the reason why the defendant had not been summoned, and then the plaintiff's lawyer stated that since the defendant had not attended today, he requested that an arrest warrant be issued to arrest him. The court ordered a postponement of the hearing until the defendant was summoned.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Crackdown on Golden Rooster Red Treasure Pills <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Tested and Found to be Made of Morphine, etc.</p>
<p>Owner of Ziqiang Company on the Run</p>
<p>The China Ziqiang Pharmaceutical Company was established at No. 13 Ci Zhuan Lane, West Lin Road, outside Ximen. Its owner, Wang Dianrong, had a large internal organization and scale, and specialized in manufacturing Golden Rooster Lingbao Pills (i.e., Ningbao Pills), a variant of red pills for quitting opium. It had been open for nearly a year. The Municipal Public Security Bureau received a confidential report stating that these Golden Rooster Lingbao Pills were a variant of red pills, and that the raw materials used were made of morphine and other toxic substances. Because red pills had been severely banned recently, these Lingbao Pills were widely sold and had branch distribution centers at No. 4, opposite the Xiyuan Bathhouse at the entrance of Chun De Lane, Avenue Lamwe, French Concession, and at the Mafa Ji of Cao Xie Bang, Little Shaodu Road, Avenue Robert. They were distributed to Chongming, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Huzhou, Nanjing, Wuhu, Hankou, Jiujiang, Anqing, Changsha, Shandong, Tianjin, Peiping, Qingdao, and other places outside the city. After receiving the confidential report, the Public Security Bureau sent personnel to purchase several packages (large packages sold for 50 cents, small packages sold for 10 cents) and submitted them to the Municipal Government for transfer to the Health Department for testing. The results confirmed that they were made of morphine and other toxic substances. They were sold everywhere, poisoning people. Therefore, the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately secretly ordered Lu Ying, the captain of the detective team, to order Shen Wenda and Fang Linggen, the detective team leaders stationed in the Ximen branch, and detectives Zheng Yongxiang, Bian Wenqing, Jiao Baojun, Yu Wenhai, and Liu Wenhui, to work with patrol officer He and police officers to secretly go to the above-mentioned locations at 5:30 p.m. yesterday. On the spot, a large number of Golden Rooster Lingbao Pills, weighing 12 catties, as well as printing boxes, wooden boards, and other items were seized. Wang Ni Shi, 21 years old, from Nanjing, residing at No. 13 Ci Hui Lane (i.e., Wang Dianrong's wife), Ma Miao Gen, 51 years old, local, residing at the same address, Sun Yi Bao, 53 years old, from Huzhou, residing at the same address, and Wang Shunrong, 30 years old, from Nanjing, residing at No. 10 Xujiahui Road, were arrested. The main suspect, Wang Dianrong, was on the run and has not been caught. The detective team leaders Shen Wenda, etc., took the people and stolen goods to the Ximen branch, where the branch director, Police Officer Li, briefly interrogated them. Because the matter was a strict order from the higher authorities, he immediately prepared a document to send them to the general bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Sang Cheng Shi Escorted to the Public Security Bureau Yesterday</p>
<p>At around 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, Sang Zhichuan, a native of Ningbo, went to No. 22 Xinxing Lane, Huasheng Road, Zhabei, and found his runaway concubine, Sang Cheng Shi, and dragged her to the Xinzha Public Security Bureau. According to the interrogation by Police Officer Zheng Zuhan, Sang Zhichuan stated that he was 62 years old and had married Cheng Shi as his concubine last spring through a matchmaker. Unexpectedly, in February of this year, the woman suddenly took her clothes, etc., worth about 600 yuan, and fled without a trace. She was found today at the home of Wang Jinsheng in Xin Sheng Lane, but she was seduced by Wang and had given birth to a child, etc. Sang Cheng Shi stated that she was 21 years old, originally from Daye County, Hubei Province. Her father had been a Tao Yin, named Cheng Weixian. Her mother, Wu Shi, 56 years old this year, born in the year of the rabbit, was from Guangdong. She was only a few months old when her father died of illness. When she was six years old, her mother adopted her to a Western woman, an American named Li Bi (transliteration), as her adopted daughter. She was raised by Li and graduated from Baoling Middle School in Jiangxi. Because she had been with foreigners since she was a child, she knew both English and French. Unexpectedly, a year before she was to graduate from middle school, her foster mother also passed away. Her biological mother had returned to Guangdong, so after graduation, she went to Guangdong to look for her mother, but could not find her. Later, she worked as a nurse at the Guangdong Children's and Disabled Hospital (now renamed Zhongshan Hospital). Last spring, she was invited to Shanghai by a younger sister and first lived in the same house as Sang at No. 10 Jinshui Lane, Kaifeng Road. In June, Sang invited her to Yong'an Company for a tour. She was drunk that night, and Sang opened a room at the Central Hotel, defiled her, and then asked her to marry him. Unexpectedly, she became pregnant at this time. Later, he moved her back to his home at No. 58 Changyun Lane, Dagu Road. Unexpectedly, he still had an old wife and four daughters-in-law at home, who drove her out. So she temporarily lived in the Dahua Apartments. From then on, he treated her worse and often beat and insulted her. Later, when she went out, he took all her clothes and passbooks, totaling more than 1,000 yuan, which she had brought from Guangdong. Since then, she has been wandering around and gave birth to a child named Pinwei on May 23 of this year. She is currently staying at her maternal uncle Wang Jinsheng's place, bringing the case, etc. After the interrogating officer verified the confession, he ruled that the case was complicated and sent it to the Judicial Section of Zhabei. She was escorted to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for disposition at around 10 a.m. yesterday.</p>

<p>According to a tip-off from members of the Shanghai Second District Water and Electricity Industry Union (i.e., the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Union), recently, unscrupulous individuals have been impersonating the union to collect introduction fees and large membership fees under the pretext of introducing jobs at the French Concession Water and Electricity Company. The union convened an emergency meeting of the board of directors and supervisors on the 21st of this month. It was unanimously agreed that the French Concession Water and Electricity Company never charges a fee for hiring workers. The union's usual practice for membership application is to collect a membership fee of one yuan in accordance with the Trade Union Law and the union's charter, but it must be certified by the group leader of the respective group and introduced by two or more members of the union. Membership is only granted after review and approval by the board of directors. It is outrageous that unscrupulous individuals dare to damage the union's reputation and deceive society. If this is not thoroughly investigated, it will seriously harm the union's reputation in the future. It was decided to prepare a document and send it to the party and government authorities, and forward it to the Huazu police authorities, to strictly arrest such unscrupulous individuals. At the same time, an urgent notice was issued to all members and workers to be vigilant. If such incidents are discovered, they should be handed over to the police authorities and transferred to the judicial organs for severe punishment according to law, in order to deter evildoers and maintain the union's reputation.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Three Kidnappers Executed <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Numerous Crimes and Heinous Offenses Exposed</p>
<p>Silent at Death, But Asked for Ghost Money</p>
<p>The notorious kidnappers Zhang Er'a (28 years old, formerly a chauffeur), Yu Afu (25 years old, formerly a cart puller), and Ding Zinan (28 years old, unemployed vagrant) were all from Tongzhou. On April 3, 1929, at 7 pm, they, along with accomplices Zhang Qishan, Tang Yongshun, Xi Houtao, Tang Rongzong, Tang Yongfu, etc., kidnapped Deng Zhonghe outside No. 378 Ningbo Road and demanded ransom. At that time, they immediately tied Deng up and took him to a祠堂 (ancestral hall) in Pudong, hiding him in the loft. Zhang Er'a and others took turns guarding him for more than ten days and then divided the ransom of 120 yuan. Later, Zhang Er'a, Yu Afu, Tang Yongshun, and Qian Xu'en, Ji Jinhua, Wang Alin, etc., who had already been executed by firing squad, kidnapped Liu Tongsheng outside No. 218 Yuezhou Road at about 10 am on July 6, 1932, and demanded ransom. Zhang Er'a stood at the intersection of Zhoushan Road as a lookout while Liu was being kidnapped. When the car arrived at Tangjia浜 (Tang Family Creek), it ran out of gasoline. Qian Xu'en and others then took Liu Tongsheng out of the car. He was rescued by the local defense corps, and Tang Yongshun and other bandits fled in all directions. In December of the same year, Zhang Er'a, Yu Afu, Ding Zinan, Wu Er'a, Tang Yongfu, and Cao Houfu, Zhao Lian, Lao Wang, Xiao Dongyang, etc., who were at large, discussed kidnapping Fang Jinhong of the Sincere Company at the Deyilou in the Eight Immortals Bridge area and demanding ransom. Lao Wang was responsible for hiring the car, Wu Er'a was responsible for driving the car, and Cao Houfu was responsible for advancing the money. First, Zhang Qishan, Xi Houtao, and Cao Houfu, through the rickshaw puller Qian Hengshan, pointed out Fang Jinming at the entrance of the Sincere Company, and Cao Houfu identified the location for hiding the ransom note at the祠堂 (ancestral hall) on Lincoln Road. Tang Yongshun and Xiao Bai and Xiao Da waited there to collect the note. Cao Houfu did not have money to advance, so Tang Rongzong advanced 5 yuan to Ding Zinan and 10 yuan to Tang Yongfu. Then, at about 7 pm on December 9, when Fang Jinming was returning home, they implemented the kidnapping plan. First, Cao Houfu, Zhang Qishan, and Wu Houtao invited Qian Hengshan to the north side of the Sincere Company. Cao Houfu ordered Xi Houtao to follow Fang Jinming on the tram at the entrance of the Sincere Company. At the Jing'an Temple Road station, Fang Jinming transferred to a trackless trolley. Cao Houfu followed him to Yuyuan Road. At that time, Tang Yongfu was riding a bicycle, acting as a lookout in the Yuyuan Road area. Lao Wang hired a car from the Tiantian Motor Company on Baker Road. The chauffeur, Deng Jinsheng, drove to the east side of Yuyuan Road, at the bamboo fence alley entrance on Yidingpan Road. Lao Wang threatened him with a gun and drove Deng Jinsheng out of the car, sending him into the alley to be guarded by Yu Afu. Lao Wang returned to the car, and Wu Er'a drove. Zhang Er'a, Zhao Da, and Ding Zinan got into the car one after another and drove to the Zhaofeng Garden area on Yuyuan Road. Because Fang was stubborn and shouted, he provoked Lao Wang's anger, who shot and killed Fang. Subsequently, the foreign patrol房 (police station) arrested the above three major criminal suspects, Zhang Er'a, Yu Afu, Ding Zinan, Tang Yongshun, Zhang Qishan, Xi Houtao, Tang Rongzong, Tang Yongfu, etc., and handed them over to the First Special District Court. Judge Wu Tingqi repeatedly held court hearings and, after clear investigation, sentenced the three criminals, Zhang Er'a, Yu Afu, and Ding Zinan, to death. (Tang Yongshun, Zhang Qishan, etc., were sentenced to life imprisonment or first-class imprisonment). The judgment was submitted to the superior for review and approval and executed according to the judgment. At about 9 am yesterday, Judge Wu Tingqi of the First Special District Court opened court and ordered the three criminals, Zhang Er'a (i.e., Zhang Mahou), Yu Afu, and Ding Zinan, to be brought to the case. After briefly questioning them and asking if they had any last words, he ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to take the judgment and photos of the criminals and escort them to the Caoh河 (Cao River) and泾 (Jing River) Jiangsu Second Prison for execution. Prior to this, the Special District Court sent a letter to the Nanshi District Court, requesting them to send personnel to supervise. Chief Prosecutor Zhong Shangbin appointed Prosecutor Xie Lian as the supervising execution officer. He also instructed Judicial Sergeant Chen Junfang and Police Inspector Chen Xihui to supervise the execution. Court police officers Wang Jianqing, Zhou Qiwen, Zhang Chunshen, Gao Jinsheng, Xiong Dingchen, Zou Zhendong, Lu Conghe, Zhu Zhiqi, Lu Yin, Shen Tingfang, and Long Zelin took a car to the prison. Soon, the prison cars arrived one after another. Prosecutor Xie Lian ascended to the public case and ordered the three criminals, Zhang Er'a, Yu Afu, and Ding Zinan, to be brought to the case. As usual, he asked about their age, origin, and if they had any last words. The criminals all replied that they had already stated their final wishes to the Special Court, and there was no need to say more. However, they had a request: the Yin and Yang worlds are one. The Yang world needs money, and the Yin world also needs ghost money. Could they buy a one-yuan ghost money ingot? They would be very grateful. They also said that it was only right that they were being executed today. "You reap what you sow, but we don't know how we will be executed. Will it be by shooting or hanging?" The executioner replied that it would be by shooting. The criminals looked at each other and laughed, and said to the executioner, "Please do your job cleanly and quickly. We were all together in life, and we won't be lonely in the underworld after death." After speaking, they strode to the execution ground, knelt side by side. Sergeant Chen Junfang blew a whistle, and three shots were fired simultaneously. The heinous kidnappers fell to the ground and died at the same time. Prosecutor Xie inspected them closely, and Inspector Xuan Zhiming inspected them separately. The bodies were placed in coffins by the court.</p>

<p>Pan Jindao, who opened a tailor shop at No. 212 Bubbling Well Road, passed away on the 5th of this month. However, before his death, he breached the trust of his customers by pawning the leather goods, silks, and clothing materials entrusted to him by his customers at various pawnshops. The patrol房 (police station) found 34 pawn tickets, with a total pawn value of about 200 yuan. Because the tailor shop's account book only recorded the names of the customers and not their addresses, the victims should make a statement to the French Concession Police Department.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I read a news item in yesterday's newspaper about a fire on North Zhejiang Road, which is slightly inconsistent with the facts. I hope you will correct it as follows: "At 5 pm on the 22nd of this month, a fire suddenly broke out in the engine room of a printing factory at No. 5, Lane 138, Houyu里 (Houyu Lane), North Zhejiang Road, where machine oil,格司林 (gasoline), and paper were piled up. The engine room was only separated from our factory by one board. After being discovered by our factory workers, they immediately sounded the alarm and notified the Central Fire Brigade for assistance. However, at that time, the internal water pipes were being repaired due to the main valve, and the water source was cut off, making it impossible to rescue. For a while, the fire was fierce, spreading from the north side of the building to the south side. All of our factory's machinery and buildings were buried in the fire. Later, the Central Fire Brigade drove to the scene and tried their best to put out the fire. According to statistics, the loss suffered by our factory in this disaster is estimated to be more than 50,000 yuan, and more than 80 workers have lost their jobs." This is to the chief editor of the *Shen Bao*, Chen Qingjian, manager of Jinchang Iron Works, November 24th. To the Editorial Department of the *Shen Bao*: Today's local news in your newspaper reported on the Changzhou National Goods Exhibition sponsored by the Association for the Promotion of National Goods, stating that the registration office is located at the first house in Tongan里 (Tongan Lane), across from the Silk Industry Bank on Sanmalu (Third Road), the Preparatory Office of the Changzhou National Exhibition. After investigation, the first house in Tongan里 (Tongan Lane) is our association's office. Although there are vacant rooms for rent on the second and third floors, there is no establishment of the Association for the Promotion of National Goods, nor is there an attached Preparatory Office of the Changzhou National Goods Exhibition. Our association has not been involved in this matter. Because of the reported location, several people have come to ask today, and there may be a misunderstanding. Therefore, we make this statement, and hope that it will be published as a letter to the editor. This is addressed to the Editorial Department of the *Shen Bao*, Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, 24th.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Long-Rumored Match: Today, the East China and Ingles Teams Will Clash <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>First Division Match at Yiyuan at 3 PM</p>
<p>The Outcome Will Affect the Future of the First Division Championship</p>
<p>Youyou vs. Xishang at Shenyuan</p>
<p>Today afternoon marks a critical juncture in the Western League First Division Football Tournament. East China and Ingles will meet at Yiyuan. Recently, East China has been radiant and invincible, with five wins in five games, holding the top spot in the First Division. Before Ingles arrived, Huasai stepped in, leaving with a record of four wins in four games before leaving. However, Ingles was defeated by Xipu in their first match in Shanghai with a score of two to one. However, we cannot judge Ingles based solely on this match. It is said that there are three reasons for the defeat against Xipu: (1) The field was wet after the rain, preventing them from displaying their strengths; (2) It was their first time in Shanghai, and they were not accustomed to the terrain and climate; (3) There were two substitutes on the team. In any case, Ingles is definitely not an ordinary team. Goalkeeper Smeaton's skill is among the best in Shanghai, and his running style is similar to Hua Fengsi's. The true extent of their strength will be revealed today. If East China loses, the championship will be divided three ways, with East China, Xipu, and Ingles each having one defeat. Otherwise, East China will surpass everyone, with six wins in six games, and others will be unable to catch up. Its impact on the future of the First Division Championship is truly not small. There is also another First Division match today, Youyou versus Xishang, held at Shenyuan. Youyou has a high chance of winning.</p>

<p>Sixty-Four to Thirty-Five Over Tongji</p>
<p>Yesterday's Western Youth Basketball Tournament featured a busy schedule with as many as seven matches, but few were truly exciting. In the Second and Third Division matches, Lingnan and White Cat had a fierce contest, with White Cat narrowly escaping with a two-point difference. Eagles defeated Evening Star, and China defeated American Children, both with scores of thirty-seven to twenty-two, a coincidental occurrence. The remaining matches all resulted in one-sided outcomes due to the disparity in strength.</p>
<p>The final act, the First Division match, saw the Pirates revealing their edge for the first time. Veteran Sullivan returned to the team, displaying his former prowess. However, since it was his first time back, the teamwork was not yet fully polished. Tongji's athletes, facing a strong opponent, fought hard to meet the challenge, making the situation quite balanced. Qi Lu, the two forwards, frequently scored with long shots. In the first half, Tongji trailed by only nineteen to twenty-seven. In the end, the Pirates won with a score of sixty-four to thirty-five. There will be no games tonight.</p>

If there are not enough winners, the vacancies will be filled. If there are too many winners, a drawing method will be used to solve the problem. In addition, the two middle schools with the most circled names will each be given a set of the Kaiming Twenty-Five Histories by Huamei. The two primary schools with the most circled names will each be given a set of the Commercial Press Children's Library.

<h3 id="e195">"Planning" and "Realization" <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Ping</p>
<p>Everyone has plans, but plans are either big or small. Big plans concern the conduct of national administration, while small plans concern personal matters. However, various plans may not necessarily be realized.</p>
<p>My younger brother is now studying at a primary school. In the past, every time the semester ended, whether it was the summer or winter vacation, he would always make a plan regarding the subjects he would study on his own during the vacation, and he would also make a very strict timetable. It was indeed a perfect plan, but his plan was never realized.</p>
<p>The reason for his failure is as follows: because he felt very tired mentally after the exams, he took the first week of the vacation as a rest. But in the second week, he changed his tone and said, "There are two months of vacation, why rush so much! It's okay to play for a few days before starting." However, time passed like an arrow, and a week before school started, he felt a little anxious, so he hastily did all the homework! It's just that it's really impossible to put away a heart that has been set free for a long time, so his plans have never been realized year after year.</p>
<p>Children; I'm afraid you have this problem too!</p>
<p>There are two reasons why plans cannot be realized: (1) The plan is too big, and it feels a little difficult to handle; (2) Not starting immediately; You must know that plans can be smaller, but you must use all your energy to do them, and the result will always be a day of realization.</p>
<p>Children: There is nothing in the world that cannot be done well, as long as you work hard! Children! Work hard! Work hard!</p>
<h3 id="e196">Darwin <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Children, do you know this great man? He was a British naturalist and the originator of the theory of evolution. He was born in 1809 AD and died in 1882 AD, living to the age of 73. His life's deeds can serve as a model for you.</p>
<p>His body was very large, but not very strong. Therefore, he had certain rules for every move he made: he got up at 6:00 AM, and after getting up, he had to take a cold shower, and then walk, read, and do morning exercises in a very quiet place, and work at 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>His method of reading was very scientific. Every time he read a book, he would write the good parts of the book on the last page of the book. If it was someone else's book, he would extract its key points. If he wanted to study a certain subject, he would check the last page of the book and create a new table of the collected information related to that subject. Therefore, all the facts he obtained in his life can be checked one by one without omission.</p>
<p>He was not very precise in dissection, and he could not draw, so it took him more effort than others when he studied, but he encouraged himself and finally achieved good results.</p>
<p>Every time he read a book, he had to think for a long time before he could distinguish what was right and what was wrong. He had a very strong memory. Although he got some general information, he was able to study the materials he had seen before from this general information.</p>
<p>When he was researching and discussing, he was not stubborn about his original opinions at all. Although the theory he had obtained before could solve the facts that he already knew; however, when he was studying the remaining parts, if the theory did not match the new facts, he would immediately abandon it without regret; and then study it carefully to seek other new theories.</p>

<p>— Dan Yun</p>
<p>Two bricks, fired together in the kiln, sat side by side, talking intimately.</p>
<p>Two days later, the two bricks were loaded onto a truck and transported to a construction site.</p>
<p>Once the house was built, one brick was placed at the highest point of the wall, while the other was placed at the base of the wall. The brick above was very proud and often mocked the one below.</p>
<p>"Now you are under my feet. Being above is such glory, so delightful!" it said.</p>
<p>"Don't be so proud. Perhaps an even worse fate awaits you," the brick below cautioned.</p>
<p>"Impossible, absolutely impossible."</p>
<p>One night, a great wind and rain caused the house to collapse. The brick above shattered as it fell, while the brick below remained standing, unshaken.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Squeezing Oil Dregs <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ming</p>
<p>I remember when I was seven or eight years old, I went to my maternal grandparents' house and played a game called "Squeezing Oil Dregs" with many cousins and neighboring children. We would all line up on a long bench, shout "One, two, three," and then push each other with all our might. The side that had more people squeezed off would lose. Although I was very young at the time, I was also clever. I thought that sitting in the middle would make it difficult to be squeezed out. Little did I know that my strength was too weak to resist, and I was attacked from both sides, squeezed until I could barely breathe. I was completely fooled. Later, I thought it would be best to sit at the end of the bench, so I wouldn't be trapped like that. Luckily, the end I was sitting on was winning, but it wasn't because of my strength; I was just taking advantage of the situation to push along. As soon as there was an empty space at the end of the bench, those who were being squeezed on the other side rushed to this end, and I was once again squeezed into the middle, suffering the same predicament as before. So, I had no choice but to quit and dare not participate again.</p>
<p>Now, recalling this game, it's truly a good lesson. You must have the ability yourself to prevail in everything. If you try to be opportunistic, take advantage, or rely on others, not only is it unreliable, but it will also only bring you trouble.</p>
<p>When working in society, you must have the ability to be competent. Otherwise, you will be like oil dregs being squeezed out. Children, you must cultivate your abilities well to lay a solid foundation for your future work, so you won't be squeezed out!</p>

<h3 id="e201">American Children's Battleship <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Dan</p>
<p>Children! When you see this title, you must think it's strange. It's called the American Children's Battleship. The story of it is very admirable.</p>
<p>The story begins with a teacher in an elementary school in America. One day, he took many students to play by the sea. Suddenly, a warship came, moving quickly on the sea. A lively child asked, "How much does it cost to build such a warship, teacher?" The teacher replied, "A warship costs several hundred thousand dollars. But if you save the money you spend on candy and toys every day, it wouldn't be difficult to build a warship!" So, from that day on, they saved all the money they would have spent on candy and toys. Many American children joined in. Later, they actually achieved their goal. Ah! This is such a glorious thing!</p>
<p>Children: We hope that in the future, we can also build a Chinese Children's Battleship even bigger than the American one. This is not difficult either. As long as many children in Shanghai save all the money they would have spent on candy and toys, they will also achieve their goal in the future. So, we hope that starting today, you will quickly put it into practice.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Touch <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Dun</p>
<p>Whenever our bodies come into contact with something, we have a sensation. This sensation is touch. Touch is a strange thing. Touch nerves in our bodies also differ in sensitivity.</p>
<p>The most sensitive parts of the body are the fingers, lips, and tongue. If we close our eyes and want to distinguish the size and shape of an object, we must use our hands to touch it, especially our fingers to explore, in order to accurately discern it. If we spread our palm open and have someone place an object on it (as in Figure 1), we will definitely make a mistake. If we use our fingers to touch it, we can distinguish it clearly. But the sense of touch in our fingers can sometimes be inaccurate. If you close your eyes and press (as in Figure 2) on a small ball, you will definitely feel like you are pressing on two balls.</p>
<p>We use the sense of touch in our muscles to estimate the weight of objects. This experiment is also very amazing. If you (as in Figure 3) hold two very heavy objects, even if the weight of the two objects is different, it is difficult for us to distinguish which one is heavier and which one is lighter. But if you hold two light objects, you will immediately feel which one is heavier and which one is lighter. The sense of touch on the back is the dullest. If (as in Figure 4) you have two fingers touching your back, you will definitely only feel one finger.</p>
<p>It's even more interesting to experiment with touch using three basins of water with different temperatures. If you put one hand in hot water and the other hand in cold water, and after a minute or two, put both hands in lukewarm water at the same time, the hand that was just in hot water will feel the water is very cold, and the hand that was just in cold water will feel it's very hot.</p>
<p>Children, do you think this is very strange? Is it possible that the sense of touch can also play tricks? No, it's because our skin experiences different gains and losses of heat, so the temperature of our skin also often varies accordingly.</p>

<p>There were many monkeys on a mountain who lived peacefully. But suddenly, a tiger came from somewhere and ate several of them every day, so that the number of monkeys gradually decreased. The entire monkey tribe became panicked and convened a meeting of all the monkeys on the mountain to discuss how to deal with the tiger and protect their lives. Everyone thought that the lion was more powerful than the tiger, so they invited the lion. Sure enough, from then on, the tiger dared not come again. But the monkeys continued to decrease day by day, because the lion replaced the tiger and ate the monkeys. This means: It is useless to rely on others.</p>
<p>Snake and Frog</p>
<p>A snake saw seven or eight frogs together on the road. It was very hungry and wanted to eat these frogs, but it was afraid that many frogs would unite and beat it, so it just waited quietly by the side. After a while, suddenly these frogs started fighting for some reason and scattered. Taking advantage of this good opportunity, the snake went over and ate them all one by one. See! Although they are weak things, when they are united, they can even scare a snake. What powerful, united strength!</p>

<p>Little animals are going to sleep! The weather is getting colder and colder, the grass and flowers are withering, and many lively little animals have disappeared. The world is so lonely! These little animals, like frogs, bees, lizards, ants... Where are they all? It turns out they are all sleeping. They can't bear the cold, and they can't find food outside, so they simply take a long nap. When the spring breeze is warm and everything flourishes next year, they will wake up and get to work. This is called "hibernation."</p>
<p>Pine and cypress also wither. Pine and cypress trees have green leaves all year round, so they are called "evergreen trees." The ancients also had the saying "pine and cypress wither last." Many children doubt that the leaves of pine and cypress will not wither. In fact, that's not true. Before the old leaves fall off, new leaves have already grown. Because of metabolism, they will never be bald.</p>
<p>Can fish freeze to death? In December, the water is so cold. Sometimes there is a thick layer of ice on the river. Many children must wonder if fish don't wear clothes and don't sit by the fire, they will definitely freeze to death. In fact, fish hide at the bottom of the river at this time and maintain a considerable temperature. Unfrozen water remains, and they can absorb the oxygen in the water, so they will definitely not freeze to death. If the ice reaches the bottom of the river and there is no water left, the fish will stiffen, and they can no longer survive in the world.</p>

<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>Scene One: Using Candles to Perform Magic</p>
<p>Mr. Science is a kind-hearted old man. Today, he is going to perform magic in front of thousands of children. As soon as he comes on stage, he takes out a candlestick, puts it on a small square table, lights the candle, and takes out a tinplate trumpet from his sock pocket.</p>
<p>"Everyone, who can use this trumpet to blow out the candle?"</p>
<p>Thousands of little hands are raised at the same time, shouting in unison: "I can... I can... It's easy..."</p>
<p>Mr. Science points to a girl in the front row of the stage and asks her to come up.</p>
<p>This child goes up, picks up the trumpet, and blows at the candle in her usual way of blowing the trumpet, with the trumpet mouth facing the candle and the tube held in her lips. She blows hard, but strangely, the candle flame not only doesn't go out, but instead floats towards the trumpet mouth (see Figure 1). Then a burst of laughter erupts from the audience.</p>
<p>Figure 1: Wasted Effort</p>
<p>Mr. Science says, "The way she blew it will not extinguish the candle. When she blows, the air comes out of the tube, goes along the smooth, sloping surface of the tinplate, and comes out of the trumpet mouth, dispersing around the candle. At the same time, the air outside immediately rushes towards the trumpet mouth to fill the empty space in the middle of the trumpet mouth. When the outside air rushes over, the flame is also carried towards the trumpet mouth. Now, if you turn the trumpet upside down and blow, you can extinguish the candle."</p>
<p>The child follows his instructions, puts the trumpet mouth against her own mouth, and aims the tube at the candle flame. With a blow, it goes out as expected (see Figure 2).</p>
<p>Mr. Science says, "The way she blows now, the air enters the trumpet from the mouth, so it is concentrated. When it comes out of the tube, the flame is subjected to this force of air, so how could it not be extinguished?"</p>
<p>Mr. Science then takes out a plate and a light bulb. He puts some water in the plate, relights the candle that was just extinguished, and stands it upright in the plate, then covers the candle with the light bulb. Before long, the candle flame gradually dims, and as a result, it is completely extinguished.</p>
<p>"Do you understand why this is?" Mr. Science asks. "Air contains a kind of oxygen, which is indispensable for combustion. Because the candle is covered with a light bulb, the oxygen inside is soon used up, so the flame has to go out. But I have a way to keep the flame from going out."</p>
<p>As he speaks, he picks up a piece of thick cardboard and cuts it into a T shape with scissors. He relights the candle inside the light bulb. The candle soon dims and is about to go out when he puts the T-shaped cardboard in the center of the light bulb, with the same distance on both sides. Ha! The flame lights up again!</p>
<p>Figure 3: Sight Restored</p>
<p>Mr. Science says, "You see: Because this light bulb has the cardboard on it, it is divided into two parts. The hot, used air goes out from one side, and the cold, fresh air comes in continuously from the other side, so it burns again."</p>
<p>"How do we know that air is going in on one side and air is coming out on the other side? Let's also perform a magic trick to prove it," he says. After speaking, he picks up two small paper streamers, strikes a match, lights them, and puts them next to the T-shaped cardboard, one on each side. At this time, the flame of one paper streamer is pointing downwards, and the other is pointing upwards.</p>
<p>"The flame of this paper streamer is pointing downwards, proving that air is coming in from the outside; the flame of this paper streamer is pointing upwards, proving that air is coming out from the inside."</p>
<p>A round of applause rises from the audience. The curtain closes. (End of Scene One)</p>

<h3 id="e209">The Name and Reality of Gender Equality <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhimin</p>
<p>Since the Legislative Yuan passed Article 239 of the Criminal Law, which stipulates that a married woman who commits adultery shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than one year, and the adulterer shall be punished in the same way; but there is no provision for punishing a married man who commits adultery, the principle of gender equality in law is violated, which has caused fierce protests from women's circles in Beijing and Shanghai. This is indeed a good phenomenon. Regarding this issue, I remember Mr. Wang Chonghui, a Doctor of Law, made a statement: "A married woman who commits adultery is punished, while a married man who commits adultery is not. This is indeed based on physiological reasons. Old laws of various countries a hundred years ago were all like this, and even today there are three or four countries that still follow it, and our country is one of them."</p>
<p>Dr. Wang is a legal expert, so what he says must be based on evidence. According to him, the crime of adultery has historically been specifically designed to treat women, and it is based on physiological reasons (unfortunately, Dr. Wang did not specifically explain these physiological reasons). But he also said, "According to historical facts, in recent hundred years, this kind of law that treats men and women unequally has gradually decreased in the civilized countries of the world." What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>The reason for this is a long story, and it cannot be fundamentally discussed here. In short, it is because under the individual economic unit, women do not have an independent economic status and retreat into the family to become appendages of men (it is not without reason that they are commonly called dependents), male household slaves. Under such circumstances, women become men's property, with an absolute obligation to be chaste to men. Having illicit relations means that slaves are disloyal to their masters, so of course, they must be severely punished to stabilize the order of the family (beautifully named family happiness). The criminal punishment for adultery comes from this.</p>
<p>As for men, they are the head of the family, with the right to freely dispose of all property and dependents. To show their wealth and extravagance, they can not only take concubines and maids, but also seek pleasure in brothels. Society not only does not regard this behavior as inappropriate, but also admires it.</p>
<p>In recent hundred years, due to the development of machine industry and division of labor, machines can be used by women, and the family has been simplified, women have had the opportunity to make a living independently and have gradually escaped from household slavery. The call for women's liberation has arisen from this. At the same time, in the modern individual free competition economy, even within the scope of the family, men do not need redundant household slaves, but need a "good helpmeet" who can consciously take responsibility. Therefore, the criminal law punishing women for adultery has gradually been abolished in various industrial countries.</p>
<p>From a modern point of view, the relationship between the two sexes is entirely based on free will. There is freedom to marry and freedom to divorce, fundamentally breaking the concept of chastity; due to economic development and the resulting public social interaction between men and women, this concept of chastity cannot be maintained. But the fact has also proven that the fixed relationship between the two sexes, that is, the monogamous family system, does not completely fail to be established because of this. This is because, aside from the morality of chastity, there is also the necessity of common life between husband and wife, the necessity of cohabitation between the two sexes, and the conscious will as the basis for maintenance.</p>
<p>Based on the above views, demanding the abolition of the law punishing women for adultery is a clear and just proposition to eliminate the remnants of barbarism in history and to remove a layer of oppression from women. However, looking at the petition movement of representatives of women's organizations in Beijing and Shanghai, it seems that they do not intend to fundamentally remove the oppression of women. In their hearts, they still believe that it is necessary to use criminal punishment to punish women's adultery, but they feel that this unilateral provision hurts the face of gentry-class women, so they innovate and retain the "ill-treatment" suffered by women, and add the same "ill-treatment" to men in the form of retaliation. Such equality really shows that the personalities of husband and wife are not respected, which is somewhat not thorough.</p>
<p>I want to state that I am not advocating adultery. Adultery cannot be prohibited by law, nor can it be advocated by anyone. Generally speaking, the prevalence of adultery is due to economic reasons, the lack and imperfection of sexual life between men and women (such as many young men and women cannot marry due to livelihood problems, inappropriate marriages for the sake of wealth and power, the excessive concubines in wealthy families, discord between husband and wife, restrictions on livelihood and children, and even poor women who obtain invisible income through adultery with the consent of their husbands... etc.). All officially established couples know to restrain licentiousness and strive to maintain harmony between husband and wife and stability of family life from the needs of common life and the education of children. This is especially true among ordinary people, even among those whom the gentry class consider "ignorant women of the lower class." This is to ask the current "avant-garde" of women's liberation to relax.</p>
<p>Modern women, even in various industrial countries, have only achieved nominal equality in law, and are still far from actual equality. In the current economic system, although women have some opportunities to make a living, the opportunities for their careers are still fewer than those for men. Working women are even more particularly exploited by machines as weaker individuals. After marriage, women still fall into the status of household slaves or semi-slaves due to household services and the burden of giving birth to and raising children. Under this kind of actual inequality, if enthusiastic women's rights activists do not strive to improve women's status from these actual unequal situations and demand that the law give women special protection, and even deny or cover up this actual inequality, and only strive for legal equality on the surface, the result will be that women will still suffer. For the strong and the weak to sign an equal treaty while maintaining the status quo is to maintain the inferior position of the weak.</p>
<p>Even in the case of adultery, women in the current environment have less convenience and difficulty in committing adultery than men; men, with their superior economic and social status, can obtain more "tolerance" from the woman in their adultery, and it is feared that women will find it difficult to emulate! Moreover, for decades, customs and habits have regarded men's adultery as "nothing," while women's adultery is regarded as a heinous crime or a great shame! It is feared that these kinds of actual situations cannot be erased by the equality of half a law stipulating that men and women who commit adultery should be punished in the same way!</p>
<h3 id="e210">Legal Disputes and Others <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>This time, the women's groups' legal dispute movement shows the different types of consciousness of the Chinese people. Regarding Article 239, it is said that 200 million men will have 300 million crimes, so they cannot be sentenced. Only women are specifically sentenced. The reason, needless to say, is that women are subordinate, private property, and must be chaste. After a dispute, famous jurists even nervously proclaimed: It is really impossible to sentence men. Because 30% of the men in your country take concubines, they will all become criminals. At least, it will be inconvenient to take mistresses in the future. However, this article has finally been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. However, before the event, a certain minister was deeply afraid that the "amendment of the original案" would be resubmitted, causing the old men to want to indulge but fear punishment, so he painstakingly came up with this opinion: the main point is to change the article to "a married man who commits adultery and destroys his family shall be punished." In other words, men can commit adultery as much as they want, as long as they are technically clever. If they don't cause trouble, it's fine. For example, secretly crossing Chencang, not openly occupying other people's wives and daughters, then that is considered legal behavior. These famous words and high views completely reflect the patriarchal, feudal, and capitalist residual consciousness in male-dominated society. Their painstaking efforts are nothing more than to make the wording plausible without hindering the licentious and indulgent behavior of men in the middle and upper classes, because the facts tell us that the general middle and lower households are struggling on the poverty and hunger line, who has the extra strength, money, and leisure to commit adultery and take concubines!</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the group of women's groups who are indignant and filled with righteous indignation in the legal dispute. They oppose the inequality of Article 239, and the principle is naturally correct, but may I ask, what does this ultimately contribute to the happiness between the two sexes? Article 1052 of the Civil Law stipulates that "one spouse may petition the court for divorce only if the other spouse has one of the following circumstances." Two of the ten provisions listed on the left are "committing adultery." The current "Criminal Procedure Law" restricts mutual accusations between husband and wife in order to maintain family harmony. That is, in the newly revised Criminal Law, Article 245 also stipulates that the crime in Article 239 "must be prosecuted upon complaint." Assuming that the result of the reconsideration is that men and women are punished equally, if we follow the litigation procedure, anyone who sues a husband for committing adultery must first petition the court for divorce, and only after the divorce can they sue him for the crime of adultery. Even if the law is enforced to punish the crime, what exactly does the woman gain? We must know that Article 256 of the current Criminal Law, which only punishes "married women" for committing adultery, is completely based on maintaining the family from the perspective of male power. This kind of article does not exist in a society with gender equality; it does not even exist in the more advanced capitalist countries in Europe and America. Now our women's groups are still bitterly demanding that men and women be punished equally, I don't know what for? If it is said that men will be even more unscrupulous if they are not legally restricted, then Articles 1056-57 of the Civil Law can originally be used for relief. If you are still afraid that men will use their economic power to do evil, then you may as well clearly stipulate that these two articles on compensation or alimony should be increased. Making them bear unbearable burdens and know what to worry about. Perhaps this can make them more disciplined. Wouldn't this be more practical?</p>
<p>There is another view that chastity is a remnant of feudal consciousness and should be eliminated. Legal documents do not contribute to the true equality between men and women. Article 239 of the Criminal Law is naturally undesirable, and it is not worth paying attention to whether it exists or is abolished. The fundamental thing is to seek improvement in the economic structure. With a good society, the two sexes can obtain the same happiness. This is quite worthy of deep thought (please refer to the Women's Special Issue No. 6 of the Great Evening News).</p>
<p>I believe that in today's Chinese society, since women have awakened to the status of human beings, they should strive for the expression of human beings. From this legal dispute, we can see that "the marriage system and family organization that have been passed down have fundamentally shaken in the face of the current era of ideological evolution and the impact of all kinds of trends" (Great Evening News editorial on the 17th). Then, the lesson of the facts: the road back to the family is no longer viable. The idea of being a virtuous mother and good wife cannot cope with modern life. Only by learning the knowledge and skills of being a human being can we strive hard and heroically for the equal human status of men and women!</p>
<p>As for Article 221 of the new Criminal Law, the victims are mostly households below the middle class. However, the degree of social attention it has attracted is far less than that of Article 239. This also shows the inertia of the law in protecting human rights and the general consciousness of society. However, natural and man-made disasters have led to widespread bankruptcy in rural areas and general poverty among citizens. In the human flesh market where girls are sold, which is the parental authority enjoyed by parents, I don't know how many girls under the age of fourteen are destroyed under money and bestial desires! Even if we win the restoration of the original text of the current Criminal Law (still changed to 16 years old), what will it contribute to the facts? Enthusiastic women's rights activists, please continue to work hard!</p>
<h3 id="e211">A Record of Visiting a Certain Girls' School <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>This day was the date of a parents' meeting at a certain girls' school. Although a light drizzle fell from the sky and the ground was muddy and slippery, I happily clutched my dual-purpose blue cloth umbrella and followed Madam Landlord (whose daughter currently resides at the school), setting off for the school. After two difficult transfers and a walk along a winding gravel path, we finally arrived at our destination. Stepping through the small side gate, a glance around made me feel like the world was vastly different. In contrast to the narrow and filthy environment nearby, the school grounds featured towering Western-style buildings and sprawling green lawns. Wanting to find the Landlord's daughter, we began to stroll along the path, taking in the sights. We saw the kindergarten, the primary school, the kitchen, the dining hall, the washrooms, and the gymnasium. The construction and equipment of the buildings were indeed excellent, especially the piano room, of which there were more than twenty, almost making me think I had mistakenly entered a music academy.</p>
<p>Finally, we entered the secondary school section, which was where parents were being received that day. Here, the first things that caught my eye were two foreign women, their blonde hair combed smoothly and straight, and appearing to be in their late thirties. They stood under a horizontal banner reading "Welcome Parents" at the entrance, smiling broadly with their red lips, and constantly nodding their heads in greeting to the guests.</p>
<p>On the wall of the corridor facing the main entrance, two foot-square framed glass images were solemnly displayed, resembling ancestral tablets or spirit tablets. Upon closer inspection, I realized that the frames contained commendation certificates from the Education Bureau, praising the girls' school for its high pass rate in the entrance exams, surpassing other schools. Seeing this, I immediately thought of the lottery ticket shops at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, adorned with lights and decorations. Didn't the owners of these shops display on the counter at the entrance a golden statue of the God of Wealth, adorned with red paper and boldly inscribed with "Last Time's × Prize Won Here" as an advertisement to demonstrate the truth of their claims? The intention behind displaying these two commendation certificates at the girls' school was probably no different from that of the lottery shop owners. According to Madam Landlord, since acquiring these two commendation certificates, the number of students had suddenly increased, reaching six or seven hundred this semester, and the school was generally regarded as a model girls' school.</p>
<p>My original intention was only to observe whether the Westernization and intoxicating atmosphere within this Western-style school were any different from what I had personally experienced ten years ago. But now, this development compelled me to pay even closer attention to its curriculum and ideology. With this resolve, after finding the Landlord's daughter, I invited them to accompany me into a classroom for second-year junior high students. First, I flipped through their neat homework, English exercise books, but beyond thirty or forty new words, there was nothing of substance. Immediately afterwards, I picked up a Chinese composition book. Among the five or six essays, one was titled "Morning Assembly." As I was reading:</p>
<p>"During last week's morning assembly, students from a school for the blind and deaf came to sing hymns. This week's morning assembly featured students from the Fu'er Orphanage singing hymns," Madam Landlord suddenly flew into a rage, dragging her mother forcefully towards the classroom door. I looked up and, focusing my gaze, noticed three or four young girls with heavily rouged faces near the classroom entrance, arguing with the Landlord's daughter. They were implying that she (the Landlord's daughter), a primary school student, dared to bring guests to visit their secondary school section. Once I understood the situation, I strode out of the classroom.</p>
<p>Ascending the stairs, I impolitely walked into a classroom for second-year senior high students. This time, I began by flipping through the composition books. Among the many essays, one titled "On Women Governing the Home" particularly piqued my interest. Coincidentally, the first one I picked up contained the following two brilliant passages:</p>
<p>"Nora's departure caused a sensation, but she has already lost the sympathy of the world. If one Nora's departure has lost the sympathy of the world, the departure of thousands of Noras will inevitably be cursed and insulted by all under Heaven."</p>
<p>"The family is the manufacturing plant of good citizens. Without virtuous mothers in the home, how can the nation have good citizens?..."</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity, I disregarded the urgings of Madam Landlord and her daughter and continued to browse through several more composition books. Although none of them contained particularly original arguments, they all shared a common point: after introducing and expressing dissatisfaction with Hitler's new policies on women, they concluded:</p>
<p>"Those who have already entered the family need not go out again, while those who have not yet entered the family may be made to serve society..."</p>
<p>The true meaning here probably refers to the idea that married women should be content and dutiful, staying at home and being virtuous wives and good mothers, while unmarried women may as well go out and be vases for others.</p>
<p>In the large auditorium on the third floor, amidst many trendy young women (students) with heavily rouged faces and permed hair, we sat for a full four hours, only seeing half of the entertainment show. Before the show, the principal gave an opening address. The school had both male and female sections, and the principal was a brother and sister who took charge based on gender. Although it was the girls' school's parents' day, we only saw the female principal, in her late forties, wearing rouge and powder, permed hair, colorful clothes, a long scarlet necklace around her neck, and bracelets on her wrists, acting coy and coquettish, running back and forth. The speech and all the event management were handled entirely by her brother. The substitute speaker's speech was very short, the main point being that the purpose of this parents' meeting was to jointly conduct a new life movement between family and school!</p>
<p>The entertainment show had as many as twenty acts, some performed very well, but they were too Westernized. For example, when five- or six-year-old kindergarten students performed a facial expression song of "I See You," it was still exactly the same as when it was brought over from the West. Several small mouths kept singing I see you or You see me. Some of the female guests who came in behind me, while watching those innocent and lovely expressions, laughing until tears streamed down their faces, could only regretfully murmur to themselves: "It's so fun, but it's a pity we don't understand what they're singing." Another example was an English speech, which, although the speaker recited the speech fluently, those below the stage said it sounded like birds chirping. In addition, I also watched a historical performance of "Mother Meng Teaching Her Son." Combining all of this, it was no different from the education I received at a church-run girls' school ten years ago.</p>
<p>Disappointed, even though only half of the entertainment show had been performed, and the sky had become completely dark, I had no choice but to bid farewell. Just as I was walking out of the venue, I discovered five or six copies of "Hymns of Praise" in the book racks behind several seats. Asking the Landlord's daughter, she said that they were required to pray every morning and on Sundays. Coming downstairs, under the lights, I saw the following notice in the bulletin board outside the principal's office:</p>
<p>"In order to promote the balanced development of students in the three areas of education, each student must have a certain level of achievement in physical education, intellectual education, religious education, and social service each semester..."</p>
<p>Leaving the school gate, stepping back onto the muddy and winding gravel path, I couldn't help but put my hands together and chant "Amen, Model Girls' School!"</p>

<p>— Written by Tomita Michiko, Translated by Hong Guang</p>
<p>—Dedicated to Comrade H. of a certain spinning factory in Toyama—</p>
<p>We are almost finished with the cold dinner,</p>
<p>Before, we always ate hot dinners,</p>
<p>At this time, we would always smell the fragrance of the leftover vegetables.</p>
<p>When, Mother,</p>
<p>Will we be able to meet you?</p>
<p>Leaving you, these two children,</p>
<p>Your daughters, Mother,</p>
<p>In front of the beast-like roaring machines of this factory,</p>
<p>What kind of posture do they use to work for others?</p>
<p>——Alright, alright, I'm tired of hearing complaints!</p>
<p>Wrinkling your sun-blackened face as if about to cry,</p>
<p>Shaking your mud-stained hands as if warding off demons,</p>
<p>Grinding your blackened teeth,</p>
<p>Your face that immediately becomes angry,</p>
<p>The ugly wrinkles that anxiously appear on that face,</p>
<p>Mother, all of this,</p>
<p>How do your two daughters remember it?</p>
<p>——Sister, why doesn't our mother have a smile?</p>
<p>——Why isn't she as gentle as the mothers in plays and movies?</p>
<p>——Why can't we have a smiling, gentle mother?</p>
<p>My younger sister, still wearing my old cotton clothes,</p>
<p>Because she is a girl of seventeen,</p>
<p>After talking about clothes, Mother,</p>
<p>She talks to her sister about her own mother.</p>
<p>——Guangmei, don't mothers of tenant farmers in that place send their daughters out to work?</p>
<p>——In this kind of world, are the mothers of tenant farmers in that place gentle to their daughters?</p>
<p>——Why do tenant farmers have to send even their only daughters out to work?</p>
<p>——Why was Grandpa imprisoned in a dark jail for participating in the rent reduction movement?</p>
<p>——Why do we have to strike? And,</p>
<p>——Guangmei, why did that strike still fail us?</p>
<p>Her pale face fixed on me,</p>
<p>Eyes wide open, biting her lip,</p>
<p>Mother, because my younger sister Guangzi is also a trampled worker,</p>
<p>Also the daughter of a hungry tenant farmer's mother,</p>
<p>She listens to my words with enthusiasm,</p>
<p>Looking at me as if I were her enemy.</p>
<p>Although it is already dark,</p>
<p>Our poor tenant farmer's mother,</p>
<p>You are still dripping with snot,</p>
<p>Spreading fertilizer in the fields.</p>
<p>For understanding the overwork, your melancholy, your angry nature,</p>
<p>For the sake of not forgetting you,</p>
<p>For the sake of reaching the time when you begin to laugh from the bottom of your heart,</p>
<p>For the sake of reaching that bright time, Mother,</p>
<p>We must desperately work hard.</p>
<p>Although we are women,</p>
<p>For the sake of being able to laugh from the bottom of our hearts at that time,</p>
<p>For the sake of becoming true workers,</p>
<p>For the sake of being your hungry daughters.</p>
<h3 id="e213">The New "Obey Your Husband" Doctrine of the "Daughter's Classic" <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Muhui</p>
<p>Judging from his method of arrangement, the editor of the "Daughter's Classic" seems to have attempted to encompass all women's issues in the script. I just don't know why the lives of the eight or nine female protagonists he describes all seem to be manipulated by relations between the sexes, and their destinies are entirely controlled by sexual relations. Is it possible that women's abilities will always be as insignificant as Sun Wukong, while the supernatural power of relations between the sexes is as vast as that of the Buddha, so that no matter how many somersaults Sun Wukong performs, he can never escape the Buddha's palm?</p>
<p>I remember that twenty years ago, my grandmother often said with a sigh: A woman's fate is like a fallen flower. If it falls into a clear goldfish pond, she is extremely fortunate. If it falls into a stinking open-air manure pit, she is unlucky for life. Whether she falls well or badly, however, is not up to the woman to decide. The Old Man Under the Moon arranges it as he pleases. At that time, I already had a "so-so" amount of awareness of resisting the old moral code, so I said to my grandmother: I will definitely not be a fallen flower, but will be like a butterfly, flying freely to the east and flying to the west. My grandmother therefore cited the past events of women in her hometown one by one, and also talked about the various misfortunes of her four aunts, trying to convince me. Unfortunately, as she spoke, my grandmother's throat seemed to suddenly suffer from a cold and could not make much sound, and tears, like prayer beads with a broken string, fell one by one onto her clothes.</p>
<p>My grandmother's words were excusable. In her time, women still did not have a recognized social status. Unless they dared to play the role of the female protagonist who "poured water before the horse," they had no choice but to accept their fate and follow the chicken if they married a chicken, and follow the dog if they married a dog. They had no way to create their own destinies on their own. But now, the number of women who, like men, rack their brains, shed their own blood and sweat, and struggle and strive in the industrial, commercial, and cultural circles is already considerable. They are all able to grasp their own destiny and are unwilling to be like fallen flowers with no future, but it is only a mutual and relative influence after all, and they do not make contributions. It is just a pity that the editor of the Daughter's Classic only depicts a false feminist who absolutely contradicts herself in word and deed and is willing to be a man's gramophone, and a female shop assistant who has been subjected to all kinds of coercion and enticement by the opposite sex. Apart from this, he has not mentioned any women who live professional lives and are not controlled by sexual relations. This is a film that was compiled and performed in 1934. How could it represent my long-deceased grandmother's view of life? Promoting the "New Obey Your Husband" doctrine?</p>
<p>Oh, I remember now. When I was only nine years old, because I was unwilling to sit quietly at home, my grandmother forced me to read a Daughter's Classic. In that book, there were many unbearable lessons. Perhaps the editor of this 1934 "Daughter's Classic" wanted to fulfill his mission of teaching women who were unwilling to follow the old moral code? It is just a pity that the new daughters of today already have facts leading them to see a world outside of the relations between the sexes, and are no longer willing to believe in the "obey your husband" doctrine, even if it is a very new and trendy "New Obey Your Husband" doctrine.</p>
<p>Hasn't that Daughter's Classic, which women and mothers in our grandmothers' time all had to listen to, already disappeared invisibly? I think no one will believe the teachings of this new "Daughter's Classic," which is old wine in new bottles, right?</p>

<p>— Shuiyin</p>
<p>Some women seem willing to be looked at by others forever and do not want to raise their heads and strive for a little social status, always dressing themselves up in gaudy colors. This is something that advanced women engaged in the women's movement should be ashamed of.</p>
<p>Advanced women engaged in the women's movement should not only focus on women in the intellectual class, but should broaden their horizons and see the other corner of society, working women, rural women, and the petty bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>Rouge and lipstick do not seem very good, it is best not to use them; the white powder of the past and the red paint of the present, red and white are really the same.</p>
<p>Women's struggle for social status, I can say with certainty: "It is definitely not on the outside, but on the inside." May I ask, what can someone with no learning or talent do? Even if there is an opportunity, there is no way to do it.</p>
<p>The most suitable profession for women is elementary school teacher. In the United States, women account for more than 80% of elementary school teachers; but modern Chinese women do not want to be elementary school teachers, and seem to hate this profession the most, thinking it is unworthy, which is wrong.</p>
<p>Chinese women have not yet earned a little social status, female socialites are still very difficult to find, and there are not many women in publications about women who are willing to speak and do things; this is something that people engaged in the women's movement should be concerned about.</p>
<p>Think of a way to prevent women from hiding in their families.</p>

<p>Large Investors Vigorously Purchase, Guangdong Merchants Cover Short Positions, Gold Prices Continue to Soar</p>
<p>—Resulting in a Further Increase of 9.6 Yuan—</p>
<p>The gold market has been firm for consecutive days. Yesterday's market continued its strong upward trend. Amidst constant rumors, buyers were happy to be active. Large investors repeatedly purchased vigorously, and Guangdong merchants also entered the market to cover their short positions. The market situation remained persistently firm. Even with the efforts of the Price Stabilization Committee to lower prices by reducing the balance tax by half a percentage point, it did not affect the overall situation. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw British prices flat and American prices rising. The forward silver price in Montreux narrowed by 4.5%. Exchange rates were flat. London pure gold rose by two pence. When off-exchange pre-market trading opened, it immediately retreated to 1006.7 yuan. Eager buyers quickly emerged, and prices were immediately pulled up. The Central Bank's official listing showed both British and American prices flat. The customs gold unit rose by 0.03 yuan. The standard price for gold was 1003.3 yuan. Market sentiment was very bullish, and the morning opened with high prices. Although there was a slight dip after the opening, buying interest was strong. The foreign exchange market was also tight, rising beyond the 10-yuan mark. Banks were still absorbing supply and had positions to manage. The HSBC official listing revealed a decrease of 0.125 for British currency and 0.3125 for American currency. Large investors continued to enter the market, leading to further price increases. However, because banks were still willing to sell, prices gradually retreated. The silver balance tax was announced, only levied at 6.25%, half a percentage point lower than before. This was an unexpected move by the Price Stabilization Committee to suppress the market. Prices weakened for a time, retreating below the 10-yuan mark. However, large investors, considering the low balance tax, believed that silver would flow out in large quantities, leading to a credit crunch. The government would inevitably try to stop this. Therefore, although market sentiment was fatigued, it was not alarmed. Under the vigorous buying by large investors, prices gradually turned bullish again. In addition, banks only had recent-term selling appetite, and the forward exchange market tightened. Once the buying trend started, the upward momentum was revived. Yuan Mao Yong, with extremely aggressive buying, swept the market. At the same time, the Guangdong merchants also covered their short positions through him, pushing prices beyond the 20-yuan mark. Sellers took advantage of the high prices. At the same time, rumors spread that a certain party was coming to suppress prices. Buying interest faded at this point, retreating below the 20-yuan mark, and downstream transactions were also quick. However, market sentiment was already bullish, and even after the decline, there was still upward momentum. However, the selling interest of large investors revived, and the situation suddenly became one of oversupply, leading to another decline. However, prices were pulled up at the noon closing. After the closing, the Guangdong merchants continued to buy, and the underlying trend remained bullish. The half-day market situation was extremely volatile. This was also expected. The volume of open positions remained at around 26,000. The half-day market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1009 yuan, an increase of 2.2 yuan compared to the previous closing. Heng Yu, Fu Yu, Qing Yu, and Fu Xing Yong sold off, retreating to 7 yuan. Zheng Chang, Zhao Feng, Chang Da, Fa Yong, Fu Yu, and others came in to buy, rising to 12 yuan. Fu Xing Yong supplied contracts, lowering to 1009.8 yuan. Market sentiment remained bullish. Yuan Yi Xiang, He Xiang, Da Fa Yong, and Shang Jin rose again to 13 yuan. Hua Bi quoted US dollars for December at 25. Fu Xing Yong and Heng Yu sold and then bought, rising from 0.5 yuan to 3.5 yuan. Mai Jia Li quoted shillings for February at 8125. Qing Yu, Zhao Feng Chang, Yu Xin Xiang sold contracts, falling to 1 yuan. Anticipating that the HSBC official listing would show a decrease of 0.125 for British currency and 0.3125 for American currency, Tian Feng Yong, Shen Kang, Yuan Mao Yong, Hui Xiang, Fu Xing Yong, Heng Yu, and Zheng Chang vigorously bought, rising to 16 yuan. Yi Feng Yong, Da Fa Yong, Qing Yu, Fu Xing Yong, Heng Yu, Fu Yu, Yi Cheng, Tian Feng, Hong Xing, Heng Xing Yuan sold contracts, gradually falling to within 1 yuan. Banks still had a selling appetite. Wan Xing, Zheng Chang, Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, Hui Xiang, and Shang Na gradually rose to above 3 yuan. The silver balance tax was announced, retreating to 6.25%. British gold was calculated at 1 shilling 5 pence 6875, half a percentage point lower than before. Market sentiment weakened as a result. Tong Tai Chang, Da Fa Yong, Heng Yu, Yuan Mao Yong, Zhao Feng Chang, and others supplied contracts, retreating to 1009.7 yuan. The Dalian merchants bought contracts on the dip, rising to 11.8 yuan. Retail investors continued to supply, and Da De Cheng and others also sold slightly, falling again to 1009.7 yuan. Heng Xing, Heng Tai, Dalian merchants, Da De Cheng, and others jointly bought, gradually rising back to 14.3 yuan. Shun Mao, Zhao Feng Chang, and Yi Cheng took advantage of the high prices to supply contracts, falling back to 1.5 yuan. Helplessly, banks only had recent-term selling appetite, and the forward exchange market remained tight. Heng Yu, Fu Yu, Fu Xing Yong, and Heng Xing all bought, rising to 6.5 yuan. Da Fa Yong sold and then bought, and retail investors rushed to cover. Wan Xing, Heng Yu, Yuan Mao Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Qing Yu, and others also bought. The buying trend became even stronger. After entering, Yuan Mao Yong's buying interest was extremely strong, and sellers were helpless, rising to 21 yuan. Da De Cheng, Heng Yu, Yi Cheng, and Yi Feng Yong sold, retreating to 19.5 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Yu, and Qian Chang Xiang came to buy vigorously again, rising to 22.5 yuan. Da Fa Yong, Yuan Sheng Yong, and Fu Xing Yong vigorously supplied contracts. Rumors of pressure caused buying interest to fall slightly, retreating to 12.2 yuan. The Dalian merchants, Heng Yu, Da Fa Yong, and Heng Xing Yuan bought again on the dip, rising back to 9 yuan. Yi Cheng, Yuan Sheng Yong, Shun Mao, and Tong Tai Chang continued to sell, retreating again to 5.6 yuan. Da Fa Yong, Heng Yu, and Yu Qing Yong came to buy on the dip, rising to 7.5 yuan. The noon closing was 1016.6 yuan. After the closing, Sheng Da bought vigorously and rose, finally rising again to above 8 yuan. The maximum price during the half-day was 1022.5 yuan, and the minimum price was 1007 yuan, a fluctuation of 15.5 yuan. As a result, it rose sharply by 9.8 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The closing price, due to the Central Bank's standard price being listed at 1003.3 yuan, was about 13 yuan higher than the closing price, less than 9 yuan higher than the previous closing. The December registration price was 1014 yuan, and the January registration price was 1017 yuan. The morning water supplement was 1014 yuan. Spot goods, due to credit conditions, faced limited buying power and achieved considerable transactions. Tianjin goods were priced at 2.5 yuan higher, with a small number of transactions. Swaps were offered by Yong De to Qian Chang Xiang for 14 contracts at 7 yuan, and Fu Xing Yong offered to Da De Cheng 35 contracts at 7.5 yuan. Traders were actively quoting to the extent that those seeking swaps were eager to sell, yet sellers remained calm. On the HSBC side, news of urging the collection of cash deposits and other matters circulated.</p>
<p>Intense Buying Interest in Floor Trading, Summing up, Yuan Mao Yong, Yao Yu, Shen Kang, Hui Xiang, Ren Fa Yong, Da Fa Yong, Yuan Chun, Heng Xing, Ri Chang, Heng Xing Yuan, Fu An, Zheng Chang, and Sheng Da were on the buying side.

Dalian merchants and Wan Xing jointly made over 1,900 contracts, netting in about 100. Shun Li jointly made slightly over 1,000 contracts, netting out over 100. Yuan Mao Yong's aggressive buying was extremely high, allocating approximately 3,000 contracts to Sheng Da and Heng Xing. Guangdong merchants and Sheng Da jointly bought 1,700 to 1,800 contracts, and Heng Xing bought over 1,100 contracts. The total number of transactions on the day was 67,914 contracts.</p>

<p>Chinese Merchants Vigorously Buy Foreign Exchange, Resulting in Further Tightening</p>
<p>Banks Only Have Recent-Term Selling Appetite</p>
<p>The Phenomenon of Near-Term Looseness and Long-Term Tightness is Even More Pronounced</p>
<p>According to foreign news yesterday, London large contracts were flat for both near and long terms. American silver rose by 0.25, and the forward silver price narrowed by 4.5%. London raw gold rose by two pence. The British exchange rate against the US dollar remained unchanged, while the British exchange rate against the French franc fell by ten pounds. The US exchange rate against the British pound narrowed by 0.25, and the US exchange rate against the French franc narrowed by 0.125. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices: British exchange rate at 1 shilling 4 pence, and American exchange rate at 33.375 yuan. Compared to the previous closing, both British and American prices were flat. The Central Bank's official listing showed both British and American prices flat. The customs gold standard rose by 0.03 yuan. Chinese merchants' buying appetite remained strong, and prices tightened immediately after opening. Although banks had selling appetite, the buying interest was extremely strong. The HSBC official listing revealed a decrease of 0.125 for British currency and 0.3125 for American currency. Prices fluctuated and tightened. The silver balance tax was announced, only levied at 6.25%, showing a slight loosening. However, the situation was only temporary. Banks only had recent-term selling appetite, and the long-term market was extremely dry. This was a phenomenon that all foreign banks should have experienced under the extremely tight credit conditions. This newspaper had already mentioned it. Chinese merchants' sentiment was very bullish, so the domestic market tightened again. However, the recent-term situation was mediocre, so the foreign exchange bills for the month-end were cleared, and the long-term was more expensive than the recent-term. However, Chinese banks' selling prices were cheaper. At the noon closing, the spot selling prices were: British exchange rate at 1 shilling 3 pence 9375, and American exchange rate at 33.25 yuan. Compared to the previous closing, the British rate tightened by 0.0625 and the American rate tightened by 0.125. The long-term market was even more detached. Foreign banks continued to vigorously sell recent-term contracts, and Chinese merchants' buying intention was quite strong. However, there was a lack of supply for long-term contracts, clearing approximately 100,000 pounds for shillings and over 500,000 yuan for US dollars. The half-day trading is recorded below.</p>
<p>The British exchange rate opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling 4 pence.

The buying price was increased by 0.0625.</p>
<p>Slight Loosening of Credit Conditions</p>
<p>—Both Interbank Lending and Transfers Have Decreased—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign market situation showed a slight loosening, not as firm and tight as in previous days, and market sentiment was also slightly calmer. The HSBC incident had not yet subsided, and the export of silver had been affected, leading to a gradual loosening of the market. The interbank lending rate in the market also fell by 0.02 yuan, with both morning and noon markets trading at 0.23 yuan. The transfer fee was 0.12 yuan, also 0.02 yuan lower than the previous day.

<p>Silver Dollars Shipped to Hong Kong for Transfer Abroad</p>
<p>Silver exports have been affected by customs regulations, leading to repeated changes in transit destinations. Initially, due to increased customs duties, silver was shipped to various parts of South China and then exported abroad. Now, due to the Ministry of Finance's order requiring passports for the circulation of silver dollars within the country, silver traders face even greater difficulties. It is reported that exporting silver abroad, after paying taxes, is still profitable. Therefore, in the past three days, over 1.2 million silver dollars have been shipped to Hong Kong for re-export.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Remains Relatively Stable</p>

<p>Public Bonds Unexpectedly Face a Short Squeeze on the Last Day of This Month</p>
<p>Various Items Fall by 0.1 to Over 1 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw a generally peaceful last day for this month's futures contracts. However, in the last five minutes, there was some mutual squeeze, with the trend leaning towards a short squeeze. This was because the market had been experiencing short squeezes for several months, leading to a widespread belief that the market might switch to a long squeeze. Long positions held on for a long time, and only on the last day were they forced to liquidate, resulting in another short squeeze. Although interbank lending rates decreased by 0.02 yuan, credit conditions became increasingly tight. The future of interbank lending rates was not expected to decline. There were rumors in the market that the future was not promising. Yesterday's trading saw a stable opening in the morning, with most items slightly up by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, mainly due to retail investors buying in. In the second round of trading, numbers 11, 16, and 48 sold off uniformly, causing prices to retreat by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The prices for this month's contracts were the lowest, mostly due to long positions rolling over. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly arose, causing market sentiment to become nervous. Number 50 also sold off, intensifying the decline by another 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. The closing saw the most significant short squeeze on demobilization contracts, with this month's contracts falling by almost 1 yuan at its steepest, the most intense squeeze in recent days. Other items saw smaller declines. The future trend was not expected to rebound. The fact that there were still short positions covering their positions prevented an even steeper decline. The resulting price declines were uneven, ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 yuan to over 1 yuan. The contract squeeze was alarming. The total trading volume was approximately 25 million yuan. The resulting price increases and decreases are shown in the comparative table on the left (unit: yuan).</p>
<p>US Railway Stocks Rose Favorably</p>
<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (November 23rd), the New York stock market rose due to the strength of railway stocks. It was rumored that the Financial Relief Corporation would not allow railways to undergo liquidation before April of next year. This would give Congress an opportunity to support various railways. At the same time, short positions covered their positions, making railway stocks even stronger, and all stocks rose as a result. The bond market was very firm, and the ticket prices on the small exchange also rose. Chicago wheat turned stable. Although foreign news was weak, December contracts were sold off, and long positions in corn took profits, buyers were more eager than before. The total trading volume for the day was 1.13 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Amidst the Rising Gold Tide, the Price of Yarn and Cotton Increases Even More</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending firmer, with a significant price increase. Due to the discovery of a new high in gold prices and rumors about a certain foreign bank, combined with long position companies controlling the delivery of goods this month, the upward momentum is unusually strong. Raw cotton has also risen sharply. However, as this month is the last day, the final trading session was flat, closing at 182 yuan, an increase of 4.3 yuan compared to the October contract.</p>
<p>Distant Month Yarn Rises by Around 1.5 Yuan. In the early trading session for standard yarn, due to persistent tight market sentiment and the rising gold price, long positions became more assertive, and buyers were eager. Prices for all months rose by 0.3, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 yuan to 1 yuan. In the afternoon, most short positions panicked and covered their positions extensively. However, this month's prices were flat, while distant months rose by 0.4, 0.7, and 0.8 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 71,200 bales. Sales included Sui Long with 1,150 bales, Yuan Da with 600 bales, Chang with 1,900 bales, Chang Ji with 900 bales, Jun Chang with 3,900 bales, Shen De with 2,950 bales, Tai Chang with 3,450 bales, Chang Feng with 5,450 bales, Da Ji with 900 bales, and Guang Feng with 3,800 bales.

<p>The Cotton Market Continues to Be Firm, and the Price Increase Intensifies. Because the gold price reached a high of over 1,020 yuan, buyers were very active. At the same time, the cotton yarn market trended upward, making the cotton market even stronger. As this month is the last day, the market price was higher than the yarn market. The final trading session closed at 36.5 yuan, an increase of 1.4 yuan compared to the October contract price.</p>
<p>Big Jump on the Last Day of This Month. In the early trading session for standard cotton, although foreign cotton was flat, exchange rates narrowed, and the gold price soared to new highs. The market price rose sharply, and there were many buyers. Prices for all months rose by 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 yuan. The market situation remained firm in the afternoon. This month's price rose by 0.5 yuan. However, Da Fu Hao sold off a large batch in the distant months, putting downward pressure on the market and causing a decrease of 0.15 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 242,500 dan. Sales included Ren Feng with 2,000 dan, Jin Chang with 1,700 dan, Da Fu with 21,300 dan, Yuan Da with 4,000 dan, He Xing with 2,400 dan, Shen Chang with 2,100 dan, Yuan De with 2,400 dan, Heng De with 3,400 dan, Tai Chang with 7,900 dan, Yong Chang with 4,700 dan, Xin Cheng with 2,100 dan, Geng Feng with 2,600 dan, and Jun Chang with 5,100 dan.

<p>High Raw Cotton Prices, Factories Watching. Sales of current cotton are slightly quiet, because prices are high and factories are watching. Sources included Yao cotton with 355 bales and Tong cotton with 450 bales.</p>

<p>—Survey on November 23rd—</p>
<p>American Cotton is Ordinary and Unchanged</p>
<p>Yesterday, rumors of a large sale of American cotton to Germany persisted, and the market situation was calm. Last week, yarn factories took delivery of a total of 278,000 bales. Afterwards, due to long positions taking profits, prices retreated. Spot prices remained unchanged, and futures prices rose by 1 to 3 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 2 to 3 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to short covering and purchases by exporters, but then softened due to long positions taking profits and sales by European exporters. Flat fruit was unchanged, and Oumla fell by 2.5 rupees, while Bai Luo Xi fell by 0.5 rupees. The original telegraph is recorded on the left (November 23rd telegram).</p>

<p>Flour Market Sees Sudden Surge Amidst Rumors of Increased Tax on Foreign Wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market initially opened with stable to slightly higher prices in the morning. The pricing of foreign wheat in Chicago showed only minor fluctuations of around 1/4, while Canadian wheat fell by about 2 jiao. Consequently, market sentiment remained initially calm at the opening. However, due to observations from both industry insiders and outsiders, and influenced by the recent surge in soybean oil prices following tariff increases, concerns arose that import duties on foreign wheat might also increase. Additionally, rising gold prices added to the anxiety, leading to increased buying activity and a gradual rise in market prices, approximately 2 fen higher than the previous day. In the afternoon, market conditions further intensified, fueled by rumors of impending tax increases on foreign wheat. This triggered short covering and aggressive buying, causing a dramatic surge in prices. However, actual sales remained sluggish. Given the current famine in the country and the importance of flour as a staple food, some believe the rumors may not be entirely credible. As a result, the price for the current month rose by 7 fen and 2.5 li, while prices for December and January rose by 6.5 fen, February by 7 fen, March by 8 fen, and April by 7 fen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market maintained relative stability in the morning. The pricing of foreign wheat showed only minor fluctuations of around 1/4 in Chicago and roughly 2 jiao in Canada. At the opening, prices for the current month saw only slight variations due to the approaching settlement date, with limited transactions. Trading in distant months remained quiet, with few sellers and active buyers. Consequently, opening prices were 3 to 4 fen higher. In the afternoon, positive activity in the flour market and rumors of increased taxes on foreign wheat fueled buying interest and drove prices higher. This unexpected rumor broke the prolonged market stagnation. As a result, the price for the current month rose by 9 fen, December by 8 fen, January by 1 jiao and 1 fen, February by 1 jiao and 1 fen, and March by 1 jiao and 3 fen. The current wheat market is showing increased activity, but factories are hesitant to purchase. It is reported that Shandong wheat is being quoted at 3 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen, and second-grade wheat at 8 jiao 2 fen.</p>
<p>The Chicago wheat market has been influenced by unconfirmed reports of French wheat imports, suggesting potential selling activities there. Rumors indicate continued orders for corn imports, and the government supposedly disapproves of rising grain prices. It is widely believed that a powerful inflationary group has been formed among the incoming members of parliament, which is gaining attention.</p>
<p>Futures Soybean Oil Continues to Rise</p>
<p>— Up over one yuan in two days...sufficient to offset the tax —</p>
<p>Given the inevitable implementation of soybean oil tariffs, yesterday's exchange saw continued price increases. November rose by 3 jiao, December and January by 3 jiao and 5 fen each, February by 3 jiao, March by 4 jiao, and April by 2 jiao and 5 fen. The total increase over the past two days has exceeded one yuan, roughly covering the new tax, and all months of soybean oil futures have risen above 12 yuan. The distant month (April) reached a high of 12 yuan 9 jiao 5 fen. The spot price yesterday opened at 12 yuan 2 jiao 3 fen.</p>
<p>River Rice Sales Sluggish, Price Reduced by Another 2 Jiao</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Approximately thirty consignments from various areas (totaling 4,700-4,800 shi) are facing sluggish sales in this area, exacerbated by rainy weather. Sellers are continuing to lower prices. Buyers from other areas are acquiring nearly 1,000 packages, but with extremely strict price limits, showing no intention of relaxing them. Buyers from Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and other areas have made these purchases, but the market shows no sign of recovery. As a result, prices for various late-season rice varieties have fallen by another 1-2 jiao, with thick geng rice continuing to weaken by just over 1 jiao, Du Yangjian also falling by more than 1 chi, and Yinyuan rice prices plummeting by 2-3 jiao due to stagnant sales.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, eleven or twelve boats arrived from various river areas. In terms of market sales, Bai Geng, Lian Dao, Yang Du Jian are selling at reduced prices, while new Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan remain sluggish. Liquor businesses are not buying. Broken Geng and Ke Jian are selling at average prices. The market shows signs of Bai Geng dropping by 1-2 jiao, and thin Dao and Yang Du Jian dropping by a little over 1 jiao. New Bai Yuan is down 2 jiao, and Ke Jian and broken Geng are showing signs of weakness.</p>
<p>Foreign Ke Xian Rice Surges by Almost One Jiao in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Jiujiang Merchants Inquire About Futures Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the foreign rice market was generally quiet, with foreign firms actively selling. Initially, the market was stable, but later, due to Jiujiang merchants buying futures foreign rice, the domestic market also became active. Futures rice rose sharply by 4-5 fen, with 1,000 tons of April contracts trading, and 500 tons each for March and December, with both March and April contracts reaching 5 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen. Spot foreign rice prices also rose by almost 1 jiao. 1st grade Saigon rice rose to 11 yuan 2 jiao. A total of over 2,000 packages of Saigon and Siamese rice, both milled and unmilled, were offered.</p>
<p>Ke Xian rice has arrived in large quantities recently, with more arriving yesterday. Therefore, although there were inquiries from domestic merchants in the morning, the market remained stable. In the afternoon, after the surge in foreign rice prices, Ke Xian rice also rose by nearly 1 jiao. Demand from domestic merchants is increasingly weak. A total of 5,000 packages of Xiang rice and 1,431 packages of Hankou and Shashi rice were offered.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Dried and Preserved Goods <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Black Fungus Sees Gradual Decline in Hankou</p>
<p>The black fungus market in Hankou has become less favorable recently due to increased supply. For example, the price of high-quality Xing'an fungus, of which Guang merchants purchased a batch, was 80 yuan. Shanghai merchants did not follow suit, making it difficult to maintain the price. Compared to previous high prices, the current market has already dropped by more than 10 yuan, but more shipments are still expected to arrive. It is anticipated that the price may fall to 76-77 yuan, which is within expectations. Ordinary Jin fungus has already reached 74-75 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Metals <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>No Improvement in Metal Market</p>
<p>The metal market has shown no improvement over the past ten days. Not only have prices failed to rise, but actual transactions have also declined. However, the silver discount rate has risen to 2 jiao 4-5 fen, highlighting the tight credit situation. It is difficult to foresee any significant recovery in the market. The market conditions for major items are described below:</p>
<p>(Steel Supply Tending Towards Demand) Business for 200-pound Hui Si steel has reached its limit, with no improvement. Local transactions, apart from small retail sales, are few and far between. The market quote for old steel mill is 29 yuan 5 jiao, new steel 29 yuan, and wild chicken goods 28 yuan 5 jiao. Reportedly, only slightly over one hundred cases have been offered.</p>
<p>(Tinplate Market Sales Upside Down) Recently, due to the tightening of foreign exchange, the tinplate market is experiencing significant losses. Consequently, arriving goods are often priced higher than current market sales. The largest loss is 1 yuan 5 jiao per case, while the smallest loss is 5-6 jiao. The current market price for 90-pound American goods is 16 yuan, 100-pound 16 yuan 5 jiao, Shuangyun 90-pound 32 yuan, 100-pound 33 yuan. German goods are priced at 15 yuan 5 jiao for 90-pound and 16 yuan for 100-pound, Shuanglian 90-pound 31 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen, 100-pound 32 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen. English and French goods are out of stock. The tight credit situation this year makes it difficult for actual transactions to improve.</p>
<p>(Black Iron Sheet New Goods Arrived) After being out of stock for several days, new shipments of black iron sheet have arrived, eliminating fears of shortages. Business is slow, and prices are expected to decline further.</p>

<p>— Pheasant Feather</p>
<p>There are five kinds of intelligence: Mechanical, Abstract, Social, Aesthetic, and Moral. Mechanical intelligence refers to the ability to repair broken watches, fix broken things, and so on. People with this kind of intelligence easily approach and understand machines without special training. Abstract intelligence is entirely different. People with this kind of intelligence are particularly interested in abstract things and show their abilities in these areas. Students who do well in all school subjects, have a strong desire for knowledge, and are good at writing are those with this kind of abstract intelligence. There is also a type of student who is not good at academics or sports, but has a special talent: socializing. They can quickly get to know strangers and get everyone to recognize them and be willing to elect them as chairman or representative. We say that this kind of person is rich in social intelligence. Aesthetic intelligence is easy to understand, referring to the ability to distinguish and judge. People with this kind of intelligence can easily see the beauty or ugliness of something, or the goodness or badness of a thing. As for moral intelligence, it is the kind of intelligence that avoids making mistakes in morality or law. People with this kind of intelligence know how to avoid doing bad things, can "enter a country and inquire about its customs," and are generally more well-rounded in their behavior.</p>
<p>These five kinds of intelligence are all very important. Most people only have one or two of them. Those who have three or four are not ordinary, and those who have all five are even more remarkable.</p>
<p>These kinds of intelligence are closely related to our career choices and professions. Whether a profession is suitable for us depends on whether we have the ability and interest to engage in it. Only with these conditions can we choose a career that we can "handle with ease and joy," "achieve twice the result with half the effort," and ultimately succeed. That is, if our intelligence is close to a certain profession, and we choose that profession accordingly, the natural result will be a high degree of achievement in that profession. Otherwise, it is like a "blind man riding a blind horse." Not knowing how to choose the most suitable profession and just stumbling around randomly will rarely lead to failure.</p>
<p>But how can we know if we have a certain kind of intelligence? This can be seen from our school grades and our special interest in something. If we love mathematics and physics and have excellent results in these areas, then undoubtedly we have this talent and need to develop it.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>; if we are interested in mechanical things in any setting and want to explore the inner secrets of machines anytime, anywhere, like the newsboy Edison, then undoubtedly we also have this talent and need to develop it. Thus, the path of an inventor is arranged before us. Also, if we are not interested in machines or schoolwork, but show a special talent for speech, debate, and social interaction, then we must not ignore this talent. Schools may not necessarily promote these, and society may not necessarily encourage these, but these are still important and require our close attention. This is a necessary ability to serve society. The most powerful people in the world often have this kind of intelligence. The people who are most prominent on the world political stage or the most successful in their careers are also mostly people with this kind of intelligence. "Bookworms" are only fit to be their secretaries, and even inventors are often their puppets.</p>
<p>Chinese education does not seem to pay much attention to developing students' social intelligence, but only focuses on developing their abstract and mechanical intelligence. Chinese society in general shares the same view. For the sake of future success in the workplace, and so that those in the workforce can encounter fewer difficulties in their professions, I believe that social intelligence really needs attention. This is not only a standard for choosing a career, but also a factor that makes professional life enjoyable.</p>
<p>Here, I do not want to make a detailed explanation for abstract, aesthetic, and moral intelligence. But in general, people with abstract intelligence are best suited for writing, people with aesthetic intelligence are best suited for artistic things, and people with moral intelligence are best suited for reforming society. These are just views on how these kinds of intelligence affect career choices. In reality, these kinds of intelligence are also important for people who already have a profession. Developing these kinds of intelligence, or one or two of them, is a way for professionals to make their careers successful. We can say that in the journey of life, none of these kinds of intelligence can be dispensed with, but some people need more or less of them.</p>
<p>Overseas Correspondence Outline</p>
<p>— (Correspondence from Paris, France)</p>
<h3 id="e223">The Scenery of Versailles <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Spring Rain</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Versailles is a place as old and famous as the French capital, Paris. Indeed, it is in the suburbs of Paris, and very close to the suburbs. From Paris to there, it takes at most half an hour by train, so it could originally be discussed under the name of Greater Paris. However, if so, it would be wronged, because its fame has its own independent historical relics. This is not only because there is a majestic palace, great fountains, and a forest of towering trees, making it a scenic spot in France that is admired by tourists, but also historically, because it has become a solid fortress for nobles, princes, and all old authorities. Although this fortress can no longer protect them now, that is another question. In fact, everyone knows that in 1871 it had played a great role in defending the authorities of the time, because they used it as a strong wall for final self-defense and counterattack, and thus turned defeat into victory and finally defeated the common people of Paris. Versailles, it also left its immortal name for the first time. Of course, if we still want to talk about its historical relics, then the settlement of the 1914 Great War was also the signing of the treaty in Versailles, so its fame has spread all over the world even in recent times.</p>
<p>"Hey! Look! That section, although not very big, is also very majestic, is the earth mound of Versailles! That great, magnificent, ancient and healthy building, not very high or very short, unfolded a large area from the green shade, shining its golden yellow in the crystal white sunlight, is the Palace of Versailles!", a friend who had been there pointed out to me in the car, and told me with a tone of praise and surprise.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the car stopped like a dead snake. Tourists carrying suitcases, wine bottles, bread, and fruits poured out of the car like water from a breached dam, and surged up the lazy hillside like a tide on the beach, and then slowly dispersed like splashes of waves, hiding in the forest of Versailles and the imperial palace. This is one of the French's usual ways of enjoying themselves, of course, most of them can only do so on holidays.</p>
<p>We, who are exhausted after a week of work, have of course learned this foreign habit, and we actually went to Versailles in the same way, and even ran up the hillside in one breath. We first paid homage to the Emperor's Palace. In this long-famous imperial palace, all the eaves, walls, and ceilings are carved with ancient, strong, complex, and beautiful patterns; the golden-yellow jacaranda wooden floor makes it difficult for us, the commoners who have never been called ministers and servants, to walk, and if we are not careful, we will slip and fall. Fortunately, I held the vigilant attitude of being afraid of being laughed at by foreign friends, and after "visiting it all over," I did not fall once. The Palace of Versailles is now a large museum. French paintings from the Middle Ages to the present are countless. Animals and plants, mineral specimens, gems and jade, relics of ancient humans: stone knives, stone axes, stone arrows, all human inventions in history: ancient knives, ancient swords, and even ancient embroidery and ancient textiles, are all available like other museums. But it can also make us Chinese feel a sense of melancholy in the midst of joy, that is, there are also displayed small feet embroidery shoes, opium pipes, and so on. Of course, this kind of special customs and habits, each nation has shown some ridiculous quirks at certain stages of development, but after French tourists see it, a cold and mocking attitude makes you feel a little sad! In the hall of Versailles, the signature pen of the last peace treaty, as well as the chairs of the adults and gentlemen, are displayed, which is a proud memorial of the Allied Powers, but also a bloody memorial of the 20 million innocent victims of the last war, the pen is inserted in their flesh and blood!</p>
<p>Below the imperial palace, there is a huge semicircular fountain, divided into several levels of size. Each level of the pond bank, pond heart, and bank feet has water pipes. And the pond bank and pond heart are sculpted with countless nude beauties and beasts, holding flowers, bottles, and plates on their heads in their hands, and spraying straight and horizontal water from the mouths of those animals, like many silver guns and white swords interlaced and chiseled. In the center are several larger nude female statues, with several jets of water shooting from this place in the high sky above their heads, all converging there and falling down, snowflakes and rain falling on their bodies. There are also several semi-flat jets of water that are aimed at their ×× parts. Several main trunks of the fountain are shooting straight upwards, as high as ten feet or so; the water lines falling from the top are like drooping ears of wheat, and the top is also like silver flowers in full bloom. The white light shines in all directions, and the beautiful and dazzling fountain of Versailles is truly worthy of being the world-famous fountain.</p>
<p>On the hillside of Versailles, there is a man-made waterfall, which also uses high-pressure water source as a spring. The artificial chute of a waterfall is from several feet to several feet wide, built into countless stone steps. Under the stone steps, various colored electric lights are installed, which are opened at night, and the thin water flows over them, showing a colorful beauty, which makes people want to taste it. The opportunity to open this kind of waterfall is even less than that of the fountain, and it is rare to appreciate it.</p>
<p>We once swam in the Versailles forest in the hot summer weather. The area of this forest is very large, and the tallest trees are cultivated. Of course, there are cypresses, vine trees, etc. The shade is so dense that even under the strong sunlight of midsummer, you can only find a gap in the thin foliage to peek at the tourists. The tender green grass and the towering leaves in the sky compete for the green and emerald, and compete for the refreshing and fragrant air, not only making people forget the heat of the midsummer in their arms, but also the slight cool breeze, which has the image of the season returning to spring, and intoxicating the tourists. In the forest, there are paved roads crisscrossing, and the branches on both sides are cut so that the bottom is wide and the top is narrow, becoming a natural bridge canopy, blocking the sky at the top, making you unable to see birds flying or clouds passing. After the drizzle, the asphalt road was originally spotless, and at this time it was slippery and shiny, even brighter than the oily face of old-fashioned Chinese women. In this forest, there are often millions of tourists drunk and full, and young men and women also take this opportunity to be intoxicated in the sea of natural and sexual love, they hug and sleep on the shaded grass, which is not considered strange by the French. The scenery of Versailles is the ultimate beauty of nature, and on this point, it does not live up to its world-renowned history, but this can only become a paradise for the upper classes of France to be drunk and full all day long, and most people can only try it occasionally.</p>

<p>— A Compilation</p>
<p>——Published by Zhengzhong Bookstore, priced at six jiao——</p>
<p>Anyone who has read Mr. Liang Shiqiu's articles knows that he has a fixed system of literary theory. No matter the occasion, as long as literary issues are discussed, he always starts from the viewpoint that "literature originates from human nature, is based on human nature, and ends in life" (see Liang's "Romantic and Classical": Crescent Edition) to explain all literary phenomena. At the same time, under this viewpoint, he also has a fixed "prejudice," namely, that he believes "human nature is permanent, universal, fixed, without limitations or distinctions of time and space" (see Liang's "Literary Discipline"). Therefore, in his view, literature, as a "product of human nature," is the same in ancient and modern times, in China and abroad, permanently unchanging, and without distinction between old and new.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang's recently published "Collection of Prejudices," although composed of thirty-one articles on literary theory of varying lengths, still expresses his consistent literary views under his inherent "prejudice." This consistent view is, of course: "The essence of literature is the description of human nature" (see "Human Nature and Class Nature"). "Great literature is based on fixed, universal human nature, and thoughts flowing from the depths of the human heart are good literature. What is rare in literature is being true to human nature. As for how it relates to the trends of the times, whether it is influenced by the times or influences the times, whether it aligns with revolutionary theory or is constrained by traditional thought, it is irrelevant and does not affect the value of literature. Because human nature is the only standard for measuring literature" (see "Literature and Revolution"). "Human nature is unchanging. Emotions are neither new nor old. Literature is permanent" (see "The Permanence of Literature"). Mr. Liang can truly be called a literary critic who is consistent and forever "true to human nature."</p>
<p>However, do you believe that the lives, personalities, thoughts, and emotions of people in ancient times are exactly the same as those of modern people? Can you say that the parallel prose of the Wei and Jin Dynasties, the poetry of the Tang Dynasty, the Yuan Dynasty opera, the popular novels of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and the vernacular literature after the "May Fourth" Movement are the same? If not, then the so-called "fixed, universal human nature," and "permanently unchanging literature" exist only in Mr. Liang's "prejudice" and cannot be found in the human world at all.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr. Liang himself also said: "What kind of era produces what kind of literature, what kind of person writes what kind of work, this is absolutely correct" (see "On Modern Literature"). "Chinese traditional opera has a long history, is deeply rooted in the folk, and is still deeply ingrained today... Before Chinese society as a whole accepts Western culture, traditional opera will always exist; in other words, as long as China's ancient social traditions are preserved, traditional opera can undoubtedly prolong its life. At present, traditional opera still has its large audience, while emerging spoken drama is only weakly supported by a very small number of intellectuals" (ibid.). If literature is permanently unchanging, without distinction between old and new, then how can we explain the statement "What kind of era produces what kind of literature"? What should be the explanation of terms such as "traditional opera" and "emerging spoken drama"? Furthermore, "As long as China's ancient social traditions are preserved, traditional opera can undoubtedly prolong its life"; if we say it the other way around, it would be: "Once China's ancient social traditions die, the life of traditional opera will immediately be cut off." But this shows a truth: literature is a product of society and develops with the development of society; Chinese traditional opera is dependent on Chinese old society and survives or dies with the old society. In this case, the theory that literature is the same in ancient and modern times and is permanently unchanging is truly an incomprehensible "prejudice"!</p>
<p>However, Mr. Liang also says from another perspective: "Writers do not express the spirit of the times, but the times do reflect the spirit of writers" ("Literature and Revolution"). If we put this together with his view that literature has nothing to do with the times and is permanently unchanging, and then add his statement "What kind of era produces what kind of literature," then you will not know what trick Mr. Liang is playing. Because anyone can see that these three opinions are mutually contradictory, but Mr. Liang clings to these three mutually contradictory opinions and believes that they are all correct. Thus, can you say where Mr. Liang's correctness lies?</p>
<p>However, Mr. Liang says that "the times reflect the spirit of writers" for another purpose. Because he is superstitious about genius, believing that everything in the human world is created by geniuses, he has to use this as the basis of his theory. Listen to what he says—"All civilization is created by a very few geniuses. Science, art, literature, religion, philosophy, writing, as well as political thought and social systems, are all produced by a small number of people with extraordinary intelligence and talent." According to this statement, if there were no geniuses, no "small number of people with extraordinary intelligence and talent," then perhaps human society would not exist. Genius, truly the god-like person who creates everything!</p>
<p>Why can genius create everything? In Mr. Liang's view, of course, it is because they are different from the crowd, because they are especially smart and especially talented. But why are geniuses different from the crowd? Perhaps we can only say that they are "Heaven's chosen ones." But if a genius is born into the world, and no one makes food, clothes, or builds houses for them, and there is nothing for them to study, and they live in absolute solitude, then can they create anything? If so, then they would truly be a god-like person!</p>
<p>Genius creates everything, needless to say, this is also a "prejudice."</p>
<p>Mr. Liang opposes the theory of "art for art's sake" because this theory is not "serious"; but he wants to maintain the "independence" of literature, opposes the combination of science and literature, and opposes using scientific methods to study literature. At the same time, he firmly says: "Anyone who looks for other methods outside the scope of art and literature to use as a universal key to explain all literature is probably doomed to fail, although their failure is sometimes glorious" ("On the Third Kind of Person"). Look, isn't this the theory of "art for art's sake"?</p>
<p>Enough, there are too many "prejudices" in "Collection of Prejudices" to finish talking about, let's stop here.</p>

<p>— Zhou Leshan</p>
<p>Brigadier General Zhang had made great achievements in battle, so the young women in Place H respected him more than other heroes of the same age. When he was young, he was passionately in love with Ping. He believed that she was the most beautiful and lovely woman in Place H. Methodically, Brigadier General Zhang spent all his fortune to host banquets for her, hoping to win her love. But this woman already had a husband, so she didn't care about him at all.</p>
<p>With such a high degree of extravagance, Brigadier General Zhang quickly became impoverished and was forced to move to a small village to live. But he still kept a falcon he loved, one that could not be bought anywhere else. Now, his only remaining happiness was this falcon, on the other hand, working to support himself.</p>
<p>Soon Ping's husband died of illness. When the one-year mourning period expired, Ping moved to another environment, which happened to be very close to Brigadier General Zhang's village. Now, Ping's son had become a skilled hunter, and when he saw Brigadier General Zhang's lovely falcon, he wanted to get it very much. But he couldn't think of a way to get it, he knew how much the owner of this falcon loved it. Finally, the child fell ill. His mother loved her only son extremely, she took care of him, begging him to say what he wanted in this world. He told his mother that he wanted Brigadier General Zhang's falcon, and if he couldn't get it, he would have no hope of living.</p>
<p>Loving her son so much, Ping tried to think of a way to satisfy him. She recalled Brigadier General Zhang when he was rich, how he often tried all sorts of methods to make her happy. She felt she couldn't immediately go and talk to him. As a result, she allowed her son to get this falcon, so she went to visit Brigadier General Zhang with a girlfriend.</p>
<p>It happened that this day was not suitable for letting the falcon out to forage for food, so Brigadier General Zhang was in his garden. When Ping called him, he was surprised and speechless, and rushed out to welcome her.</p>
<p>"Brigadier General Zhang," she said, "I am here to repay all the misfortune you suffered when you loved me, this repayment is that today I and my companion come to eat!"</p>
<p>"I have forgotten the misfortune I suffered for you," Brigadier General Zhang replied, "If it were in my power, I would spend my fortune a second time for your glory."</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>In a moment, Brigadier General Zhang thought that when he was rich, how he should have treated her if she had personally come to visit. Now, there was no valuable food in his house, and he was very anxious, but later he thought of a way to solve this difficulty.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the table was covered with a cloud-white tablecloth, a kind of timid memory; they had been glorious before, they all sat down and happily ate the roasted bird. After the meal, the woman thought it was time to announce the purpose of her visit.</p>
<p>"If you recall my previous coldness," she said, "undoubtedly, you will think I am so presumptuous to beg you. But if you know the power of a mother's love, I think you won't blame me either. My son saw your beloved falcon, which is your only bird, and he has become more haggard because he wants to get it. So I am here today to ask you to give that bird to my son as a gift, I am sure this can save my son."</p>
<p>Brigadier General Zhang began to cry sadly. Ping thought that this must be a sign that he was unwilling to give the bird. She was preparing to make further explanations, but Brigadier General Zhang said:</p>
<p>"Virtuous Madam, when I first decided to love you, fate was so cruel to me. But now that time has passed, you are condescending to come and see me. When I was rich, you never did this, perhaps never even thought of it, let alone ask me for a small gift. Fate is teasing me, so I don't have the power to grant your request. Now let me explain it to you simply.</p>
<p>"When you told me that you and your companion came to eat to honor me, I thought I should offer you every suitable food within my reach. Under this circumstance, I thought of this falcon, which you asked me for. It has a very noble physique, and is fat and docile, so I hid it this morning and roasted it as a delicacy for the banquet. Who knew that now you want this falcon to save your sick son, I have no ability to make you happy, sad me will never have a happy day."</p>
<p>Saying that, Brigadier General Zhang showed her the poor bird's feathers, beak, and claws. Ping blamed him for killing such a good falcon for a woman's lunch, and at the same time she praised his generosity in her heart.</p>
<p>The opportunity to get the falcon had been lost, and to restore her son's illness was even more disappointing, she said thank you and left Brigadier General Zhang. Her son stopped breathing soon after. She was heartbroken, she lived in an atmosphere of sorrow, until her brother hoped she would remarry to restore her spirits.</p>
<p>Ping didn't want to do this, but her brother persuaded her. Finally she said: "I am willing to remarry, but..." It seemed she recalled Brigadier General Zhang's generosity, "The person I am willing to marry is Brigadier General Zhang."</p>
<p>Her brother laughed and replied: "Why are you so stupid? Are you willing to marry a beggar?"</p>
<p>"Brother," she replied, "I would rather choose a man without money than a man with money."</p>

<h3 id="e227">The Mystery of the Electron <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Bo</p>
<p>The atomic world, according to the discoveries of modern natural science, is considered a relatively old concept. Because the atom is considered the ultimate indivisible particle, and its decomposition and combination form all kinds of things, it can be said that all objects are atomic groups, and the entire world is just an atomic world. This is a hypothesis established by Democritus in ancient Greece, and it has been confirmed by modern natural science. However, the advancement of modern natural science has already led to the discovery of electrons by delving into the atom, knowing that the atom is not the ultimate indivisible particle. The atom itself is composed of even smaller electrons. This means that although the existence of atoms and the statement that all things are composed of them still hold, if we ask what the most basic particles that make up things are, the current answer can no longer be atoms, but should be electrons. The atomic worldview has changed to an electronic worldview, so people often call the current world the electric world. However, the so-called electric world, as understood by ordinary people, only means that current lighting, communication, talking, broadcasting, photography, driving, turning machines, etc., all use electricity, thus only understanding this term from the narrow perspective of applicability. In fact, this is not enough. The so-called electric world, if understood scientifically, is essentially a new philosophical worldview. Because flowing water, rocks, trees, animals, and even we humans ourselves, are just a mass of electricity, a group of electronic compounds! Of course, this is not to say that all things are just the accumulation of the quantity of electrons, in fact, the increase in quantity turns into various organic compounds, thus becoming various qualitatively different things, no longer simply the same nature as electrons. But the idea that all things are groups of electrons, that the world is an electronic world composed of electrons, is not shaken by this.</p>
<p>What is an electron? From a sensory point of view, it is a particle that cannot be touched or seen, because it is so small that it is inconceivable. A hydrogen bubble the size of the character '。' already contains hundreds of trillions of atoms, the smallness of atoms is amazing. But what about electrons? It is eighteen hundred times smaller than the smallest hydrogen atom, so it exceeds the range of what the body can feel even further than molecules and atoms. Although electrons are very small, their electric charge and mass have already been measured by the scientific community today in the United States. Milikan's measurement results show that the charge of an electron is: 4,774×10-10 electrostatic units, and its mass is: 9,0×10-28 grams, and its diameter is: 1,8×10-13 cm</p>
<p>The commonly referred to electron refers to the negative electron. In fact, electron simply refers to a particle with a certain unit of charge. Thus, electron includes both negative charge particles and positive charge particles, the former can be called a negative electron and the latter a positive electron. Electrons with the same properties are essentially no different. Ninety-two kinds of atoms are composed of these essentially undifferentiated electrons. Various atoms with different properties are simply the result of different numbers of electrons. For example, a hydrogen atom is composed of one positive electron as a core and one electron as a satellite, while a uranium atom is composed of two hundred and thirty positive electrons and one hundred and forty-six negative electrons forming the core, and ninety-two negative electrons as satellites, these are examples.</p>
<p>Regarding the nature of electrons, the current concept in the scientific community is still very chaotic. Most scientists say that an electron is only a group of electricity and has no real substance. Although they also admit that electrons have mass, they also say that this mass is not the so-called mass in the ordinary sense, that is, not the real and unchanging mass of matter. Therefore, Xiuneijie said in his "Outline of Atomic Structure": "What we usually call mass is the total amount of matter, without matter there is no mass, if there is mass there must be matter, and matter does not change due to position and speed, so mass has nothing to do with these. However, the conclusion of the essence of the electron is very different from this common sense, that is, the electron has mass but is not matter." However, strictly speaking, the current concept of the essence of electrons in the scientific community is incorrect. Mass without matter and electrons with only electricity but without a material basis cannot exist. Scraping away matter and only preserving electrical energy is a vitalist idealist point of view; admitting that electrons only have mass but no matter, then this mass becomes an empty conceptual entity, real matter becomes a simple concept in concept, which is also an idealist view of mass. This point of view shows the unscientific idealistic crisis of modern natural science in the epistemology of electrons.</p>
<p>The fundamental reason why modern natural scientists say that the mass of an electron is a non-material quantity is that the mass of an electron can change with its speed of motion. They always thought that the usual mass of matter does not change with changes in position, since the mass of electrons does not conform to this concept, it is considered</p>

<h3 id="e228">Record of Visiting the Joint Painting and Photography Exhibition of Xu Xingzhi and Wu Yin Xian <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Yuan</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Xingzhi and Wu Yinxian exhibited their recent works in painting and photography on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA for three days on the 11th, 12th, and 13th of the month. As someone who likes these two arts very much, I took the opportunity to see them twice. Now I want to leave some of the impressions left by the two visits here.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu's forty-odd works tell us that he pays great attention to the depiction of reality in his subject matter. Among them, the most eye-catching are "Famine Refugees" and "Unemployed," which use the bankruptcy of rural areas and the displacement of disaster victims as their themes, as well as "Evening Walk," "Passersby by the River," "Thin Horse," "Self-Portrait," and special edition "Ah Q." "Famine Refugees" can be said to fully express the tragic state of peasants who have nowhere to turn under the attack of famine. An old couple, emaciated from wandering on the hunger line, trudges on a desolate road in a desolate wilderness overgrown with weeds. The skinny child held by the old farmer, probably his dying grandson. There is a light of unavailing help in his eyes. Next to him is also a puppy that cannot bear the hunger. This kind of subject matter, this kind of background, coupled with the author's understanding of reality and months of long-term hard work, this painting is suitable for having a deeply touching power. Especially that dog, I think it is even more indispensable in increasing the expressiveness of this painting. At the time of appreciation, I thought that if the old farmer was willing to abandon the child he was holding, the dog would immediately bite him. And now there are many facts of wild dogs eating people in the countryside.</p>
<p>"Unemployed" depicts a miserable posture of an unemployed person leaning dejectedly on the stone steps in front of a foreign house thinking wildly. "Evening Walk" writes about the leisure of leisurely people walking their dogs in the evening. "Passersby by the River" writes about the hard work of road workers laying roads with gravel by the river. "Thin Horse" writes about the thinness and pity of a hungry horse. These paintings can mostly arouse the attention of ordinary people, and I also think they are relatively successful works in this exhibition. As for the "Ah Q" painting, I originally had high hopes for it, but the result made me feel that it was not as good as I expected. This is naturally related to the painting time, but painting "Ah Q" into such an old, stupid, and low-energy appearance does not seem to be in line with Mr. Lu Xun's ideal "Ah Q." In terms of the composition, color scheme, and brushwork of the painting, it also does not seem to be as good as Mr. Xu's other works.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Xu's three stage designs are also worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Among Mr. Wu Yinxian's photography exhibition, my favorite ones are probably the following: "Relief," "Porter," "Burden Bearer," "Water Lily," "Morning Market," "Woman Drawing Water," "Terror," "Looking Up," "Before the Window," "Card Game," "Perspective," "Returning Late," etc. Among them, "Porter," "Burden Bearer," "Morning Market," "Card Game"...etc., can forcefully express the object that the author wants to express. "Looking Up" and "Before the Window" have technical success in the capture of shadow and real objects. "Woman Drawing Water" has very suitable contours and light. The rest such as "Water Lily," "Human Body" have technical success. "Woman Drawing Water" has very suitable contours and light. The rest such as "Water Lily," "Human Body," "Morning Tide," "Perspective," "Dream," "Returning Late"...etc. all have considerable achievements in photography technology.</p>
<p>In addition, if "Noblewoman," "Leaning," "Waiting for a Kiss," "Musing"...etc., these are relatively less impressive works.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>non-material, in fact, this concept is completely the result of being misled by the old viewpoint of the erroneous mass invariance of Newtonian physics. The research of new electron physics has factually proved that electrons change mass due to motion, and Einstein's theory of relativity further theoretically explained the variability of material mass due to different motions, etc., which is one aspect of denying Newtonian principles and the other of proving the variability of mass. However, modern natural scientists, on the contrary, based on the overturned principles of Newtonian physics, that is, recognizing that the change of electron mass due to changes in position is inconsistent with the principle of mass invariance, to deny the materiality of electrons and their mass, how confused a thing this is!</p>
<p>Scientifically speaking, electrons are not mysterious and unknowable mysteries. It is the last particle of the material body that has been discovered today, it has electrical energy and mass, not only can such electrons explain the material view of the unity and indivisibility of material energy, and because of the variability of its mass, it also explains the non-mechanical material view of matter. Electrons, if based on what Thomson told us, it "is like a mass of gas, it can expand to fill all the space around it, and at the same time it can shrink to a very small space"; "The electron itself can be regarded as a particle, or as a wave"; and according to the fact that the mass of electrons can increase due to motion, etc., it clearly indicates that electrons are not yet the ultimate indivisible whole, and must be composed of other smaller particles, and their own is also a complex of a particle system. Because if this is not the case, then it cannot cause changes that can be large or small, can be particles or waves, nor can it absorb energy in motion and simultaneously absorb particles to increase mass and change mass. In this case, are electrons not yet able to absorb the infinite natural world that can be divided endlessly? Are not all things like atoms, both the temporary discovery of the ultimate substance, and a material entity with real mass and energy, and is variable, not a delusional empty energy group or conceptual entity? Are electrons not an incomprehensible mystery, is the decomposition of the universe reaching the world of electricity still a real world? Is not the materialistic worldview still victorious?</p>

<p>— Su Gang</p>
<p>I have been away from my hometown for a full seven years. During these long seven years, although I have been struggling under the pressure of life, there have been times when I have felt "raising my head to gaze at the bright moon, lowering my head to think of my hometown!" Longing for one's hometown is probably something that no one can avoid, right?</p>
<p>As luck would have it, just as I was being tormented by "homesickness," a letter stamped with my hometown's post office suddenly appeared before my eyes. At that moment, I, a "wild child" (Note: Someone who doesn't return home for five years is considered a wild child who has forgotten their family) banished by my hometown, was as moved as if I had seen a relative. It was simply an unexpected gain.</p>
<p>At this moment, my emotions were incredibly tense. The vanished scenes of my hometown surged back into my mind, and I couldn't wait to read the letter from beginning to end. However, the content of the letter did not satisfy me as much as I had anticipated. Besides reporting some trivial household matters, it expressed the hope that I would return home for a visit during this time of "local peace."</p>
<p>Yes, in the few years since I left my hometown, my family has lived a life of hardship and fear almost every day. Taking advantage of this "local peace," I should also go back to give them some comfort!</p>
<p>On the evening I received the letter, I decided on my itinerary. In the afternoon of the third day, the riverboat I was on arrived at the Jiujiang wharf.</p>
<p>I didn't linger long in Jiujiang. The next morning, I took the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway train to Nanchang first. After spending a night in Nanchang, I got up early the next morning and busily called the waiter to pack my luggage. However, the waiter was being difficult. I called out several times, "Waiter! Waiter!" but no one came. I looked at my watch and saw that it was almost eight o'clock, and I couldn't help but get even more anxious. So, I angrily ran out and hailed a car, loaded my luggage onto it, and told the driver to take me to Zhangjiang Gate to catch a small steamer.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to leave, the owner of the inn hurriedly came to meet me, asking me urgently, "Are you going to Shangrao? There are no more small steamers!"</p>
<p>"No more?"</p>
<p>"Yes! There haven't been any for a long time..."</p>
<p>"What should I do then?"</p>
<p>"There are still boats going, but they're slower," he said. Then he added, "This boat is actually quite fast, but it won't be leaving for a while!"</p>
<p>"There's a boat? Why isn't it leaving now?" I jumped out of the car.</p>
<p>"You see! It's not cost-effective for this kind of boat to rely on passengers. I heard it won't be leaving until twelve o'clock," he said with seemingly great certainty. (To be continued)</p>

<p>A girl is eighteen, a bud waiting to bloom, a lotus rising from the water, lively and innocent, a lovely girl of the human world, traveling through mountains and waters, picking fruits and climbing flowers, laughing joyfully from morning to night, happy without end. A young man lures her, shy and charming, love sprouts and blossoms, a kiss on the cherry lips, her soul flies away, a tight embrace, both joyful and afraid, her heart beats wildly, she is intoxicated, a few pieces of silk, a bouquet of fresh flowers, how extravagant, let him boast, soul and body, sold to him, so-called marriage, all lies, in reality he is someone else's father, after a long time he gets tired of it, of course he changes, separation to join the army, simply deceiving her, a fool in a daze, like a papaya, crying and laughing, a storm of tears, contemplating and dreaming, he is dead, right? Sacrificing himself for the country, how can she blame him, even if the seas run dry and the rocks crumble, she will wait for him to return home, the clock on the wall, ticking away the seconds, crushing her fragrant heart, uneasy.</p>

<p>Opening "Admonition Against Smoking"</p>
<p>I urge you to quickly give up the opium pipe. If you give up the opium pipe, the country will become strong. Yellow face and thin body, what a misery. Hunched back and bent waist, looking unseemly. Picking paste and secretly smoking, you still violate the criminal law. Thinking about the strict prohibition of opium everywhere. The best thing is to come to Shanghai. Still blowing smoke and enjoying yourself. Opium dens are everywhere with old brands. Secret earth business is booming. Indeed, the world is separated by yin and yang. Although it is good to be carefree for now. Before long the black luck will end and the national fortune will flourish. Why not seize this opportunity to harden your heart. Do not say that the ten-mile foreign concession opens the ban. You should see how the opium business ended back then. Several lotteries were closed down. A swift and thorough cleaning. Even if it is a return of light to prolong the last breath. It is no more than three or two years and cannot last long. Thinking about the old facts of the Republic of China. It is not like the old-fashioned government documents of the former Qing Dynasty. I urge you to quickly give up the opium pipe.</p>

<p>"The Story of the Heroic Sons and Daughters"</p>
<p>Lord An saw through He Yufeng's thoughts. Becoming a monk and practicing self-cultivation is her definite ambition, but as a noble lady, letting her devote herself to the empty gate would be unfair to his deceased parents. Lord An pondered over this matter every day, and later he decided that he would definitely build a temple for her to cultivate, but in this temple came an old man under the moon.</p>

<p>"Good Person"</p>
<p>Hahaha, a good person's behavior is originally like this. There are plenty of such good people in the world, but the result of his being a good person is that he was arrested. Not superstitious, this is probably also retribution, right?</p>
<p>Huamei (1060) 10:15 PM - 11:00 PM</p>
<p>"Man Jiang Hong"</p>
<p>After Li Taozhi finished her performance, she returned home and lay on the bed, crying with her head covered. The madam was very surprised and asked her why she was so sad. Taozhi only cried and did not answer. She knew that Director Hong would definitely come, so she pretended to be sick in bed and did not get up. After a while, Director Hong did indeed come, bringing many silk fabrics to please Taozhi. Who knew that Taozhi would not get up in bed? Director Hong felt bored and left after a while, but after Director Hong left, Taozhi's illness was also cured.</p>

<p>Dunben Radio Station at No. 1 Zilai Village, Minguo Road, officially opened a few days ago and broadcast a special program for two days. Due to the small address and inadequate hospitality, we would like to express our gratitude and apologies to people from all walks of life, broadcasting groups, and amateur groups.</p>
<p>Yiyin Society is an amateur singing group, recruiting male and female members. Anyone who loves music and singing, regardless of their level, as long as they have good moral character, can register. The address is Anrun Road, Zhonghua Road, Xiaoximen. The Shanghai Starlight Society has been established for only a few days, and several major companies have entrusted it with broadcasting programs and signing contracts. Therefore, the society has a feeling of being overwhelmed in terms of female members. According to the person in charge of the society, several female members are now being recruited. Anyone who is interested in studying singing and has an interest in broadcasting can contact the society's internal affairs team directly from now until the end of this month. Those who love to sing, please do not miss this good opportunity. The address is No. 29 Foch Road, French Concession, telephone number 80496, time from 11:00 AM to 9:00 PM.</p>
