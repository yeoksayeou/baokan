<h3 id="c18">西班牙政潮之回顧與前瞻　恒 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>西班牙共和國成立迄今。已三年有半。其中二年半之時間。政權操於中左派之阿士那内閣之手。於此不左不右之统治下。遂使右派之勢力。日漸抬頭。同時左派之不满。亦日形顯著。結果至使阿士那内閣。失去兩方之同情。至於崩潰。此爲去年九月間事也。此後二月間。内閣數易。皆以無法調和左右翼之矛盾而去職。至十一月初。逼使柴摩拉總統解散國會。重行改選。結果遂使新國會中之右派勢力爲顯著之增加。左派各黨議席。則莫不大爲减少。西班牙之轉而右傾。此爲一大關鍵。雖組閣一舉。仍不能不讓之中右派急進黨之勒樂。然政策之右傾。實較阿士那内閣。進步多矣。此其愈使左派失望。自爲必然之結果。入春以來。歐電時傳西班牙政局之杌隉。工潮之時起。暴動之頻作。雖未釀成重大變故。已使世人爲之驚心吊胆。此種現象。蓋卽左派各黨在國會中勢力式微。不能更用合法手段。牽掣右派之行動。故謀以恐怖手段威脅右派。然其結果。不獨絶無效果。抑且喪失民衆同情。及本年四月底。勒樂以大赦革命後所捕反革命分子一案。與總統意見不洽去職。然繼之而起之桑泊。仍爲中右派人物。且其内閣中之閣員。亦大半爲勒樂内閣之閣員。故其政策之右傾。仍與勒樂無殊。今據歐電。桑泊内閣。以加太隆問題。受天主敎黨之抨擊。悄然去職。又聞總統柴摩拉已請勒樂與天主敎黨合組新閣。此舉果能成就。則西班牙之右傾。將更進一步矣。</p>
<p>今次桑泊内閣之倒。其癓結在於加太隆問題。亦爲分治問題與中央集權問題之爭執。又爲左派與右派爭執之焦點。桑泊内閣於西班牙之現國會中。一方則恃中右派之急進黨支持。他方則恃右派之天主敎黨支持。兩者於政治上皆反對加太隆之分治運動。經濟上則反對左派之土地政策。設此二派不予援助。則桑泊内閣勢在必倒。唯自四月間加太隆之省選以來。加太隆幾全入左派掌握。於是分治運動遂如火上添油。光燄益盛。對於中央政府之訓令。不僅置若罔聞。抑且明白反抗。於此情形之下。桑泊内閣一受右派之指摘。則除辭職而外。自無他法也加之加太隆左派之土地策。與大地主之利益根本不相容。按左派於加太隆獲勝以後。卽厲行「耕者有其田」之主張。其法卽規定佃户耕田十二年之後。卽可將地主之田收歸已有。此爲代表在地主利益之民衆行動黨所切齒痛心。而桑泊内閣則毫無解决辦法。此其難安於其位。固在意料中也。</p>
<p>今次樂勒組閣。若眞與民衆行動黨合作。則其政策自必愈趨於右傾。唯於加太隆問題。究將爲若何之解决。頗值得我人之玩味。蓋現國會中。左派雖佔少數。唯加太隆固在左派手中。發政施令。唯其所欲中央若僅憑政治手腕。當難使之就範。如是則行動派支配下之中央政府。是否將岀於武力行動。是誠大可注意之問題也。</p>

<p>北平通信、北平軍分會何（應欽）委員長、蒞平坐鎭以來、一年有餘、去年冬初、除曾一度赴津、訪晤舊雨外、迄未離平、近因天高氣爽、塞外風景宜人、乃於上月二十六日清晨七時、專車離平、作察綏之遊、外間未明眞象、甚多猜測、何氏業於今（二日）日下午六時卅分返抵北平、並向新聞界發表談話、詳述此行遊覧經過、茲分誌於下、</p>
<p>（隨行人員）　此次隨何同行者、有軍分會委員何競武·廳長王倫·處長謝仲元·徐希麟·張冠亭·高級參謀王善滕·參議何朝中·秘書林啟智·副官周應方·曁衛隊一隊、平綏路局局長沈昌、爲謀沿途照料起見、亦隨車同行、</p>
<p>（途經行程）　何氏於上月二十六日上午七時啟行後、當日下午三時到達張家口、除應察省府全體省委歡宴、並岀席各界歡迎會外、是晚卽停窦宿專車中、廿七日上午八時、由察民政廳長秦德純導引赴張北一帶視察、當晚返張垣、登車繼續前進、二十八日在大同遊覧雲崗勝景、當夜在卓資山過宿、二十九日晨七時許抵綏、晋軍駐大同騎兵司令趙承綬隨行、抵綏後、歷遊舍力圖召五培寺召崇福寺召等寺廟、午應傅作義主席宴、下午二時閱兵、四時由傅作義陪往包頭、昨日（一日）遊臘昆獨侖召、傅作義趙承綬駐包第十師師長王靖國等均陪行、當日卽返包乘原專車東行、晚十時三十分過平、轉平漢綫赴西陵、今（二日）晨十時到達、遊覧數小時、原車返平、於下午六時三十分在西車站下車、</p>
<p>（流言平息）　何（應欽）委員長專車昨（一日）晚過平時、僅在廣安門車站略停、代委員長商震·委員萬福麟、及軍分會高級職員均預先在站候迎、車站四圍、警戒甚嚴、何在車中與商萬等略談後、車卽開行、維時一般神經過敏者、猜測之詞、無所不用其極何氏今（二日）晚返平後、一切流言已不攻自破、人心亦大慰、</p>

<p>蕪湖爲長江一重要口岸、人口十八萬、自通商以來、商務逐漸發達、爲皖省米市集中之區、商業情形、在民二十年前、非常興旺、自二十年大水、街市水深數尺、歷久不退、市面大衰、至今未曾恢復、全市有銀行六家、錢莊十家、大綢布店十二家、大五金店五家、大米號二十五家、工廠有裕中紗廠一家、肥皂廠二家、機器廠五家、及明達電燈公司、學校有男子中學四所、女子中學二所、職業學校二所、外國商行有太古怡和日清亞細亞美孚德士古等公司、金融情形、銀行存欵增加、錢莊退步、商店有實力者少、近來不景氣之景響、殊不易維持也、蕪湖除長江輪船每日有船上下、公路除京蕪路外現有蕪屯公路、實爲皖南幹道、乍蕪鐵路南段已通宣城、現北段擬與京滬路銜接、則業務方面更有發展之可能、一般人之觀察、蕪湖之市面實築於米市之上、每年產米一千二百萬石、將來皖北築一鐵道、自懷遠築至蕪湖對岸之裕溪與乍蕪路銜接、則蕪湖市面更有希望矣、</p>
<p>吾人欲明瞭蕪湖工商業狀况、可從海關報吿册上得到一點材料、茲錄民國二十年蕪湖進岀口之統計如次、（因手頭乏最近之海關報吿）</p>
<p>洋貨進口數額（海關兩）</p>
<p>洋貨布疋　一、九四四、六七三</p>
<p>呢絨　七三、七○一</p>
<p>電器村料　八八、七九八</p>
<p>煤七六、五六○</p>
<p>紙　一五二、八四一</p>
<p>染料　二三七、九七七</p>
<p>紙烟　五○四、一八五</p>
<p>糖　　一、五七七、三九六</p>
<p>小麥　三二、八九○</p>
<p>五金　四○五、七○二</p>
<p>其他　四、一九○、○七五</p>
<p>總計　　九、三○三、七九八</p>
<p>土貨岀口數額　（至海外及國内通口岸）</p>
<p>米穀　　一九、四○九、九七六</p>
<p>雜糧　二六、五五七</p>
<p>茶　　○、七○九</p>
<p>花生　三六、一二○</p>
<p>麵粉　八四、九六七</p>
<p>棉花　三五八、○五○</p>
<p>小麥　一六、○八三</p>
<p>豆類　五六、一八五</p>
<p>鮮疋　一、五四四、七三一</p>
<p>其他　七九一、二一六</p>
<p>總計　二二、三三六、五九四</p>
<p>從上表可看岀蕪湖地方以農產爲中心、進口貨以衣被材料爲大宗、是値得吾人注意的其間岀口與進口比較、計岀超一千三百餘萬兩、當然以本國貨品爲抵補、其間陸路運輸岀入尚不在内、地方行政方面、正力謀建議、開築馬路、若公路四通、則蕪湖城爲長江農產呑吐之總樞紐矣、</p>

<p>减省時間　連坛港風浪極大、貨輪工作常爲風浪阻遲、時有經三四天不能裝一貨者、損失極大、新造永久碼頭落成後、風浪可得止波堤擋阻、明春全部竣工後、同時可泊三輪、且能隨到隨卸、不受妨礙、减省停輪時期、於航運營業上關係極巨、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3 id="c179">由小品文說到中山文化敎育館季刊（續） <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>至於中山文化敎育館季刋，在這小品文如洪水一般的岀版界，自然不能否認它有相當的價値，雖然裹面有幾篇文章在我們並不必要。林君所指岀來的幾篇，我們也覺得是該刋中最値得看的。所以，對於這幾篇文章的内容作一番檢查，對於讀者也不能說没有益處。</p>
<p>先說李石岑先生的「世界思潮的動向」一文。這篇文章將世界目前的哲學，科學，藝術······等六大文化領域中的各種流派詳細論到岀來，不消說，我們在這裹可以得到世界文化思潮的槪論，這種總合的介紹，在我們是很需要的，因爲我們一般人的研究能力有限，能在一篇較短的文章中使我們看見世界的大勢，對於我們實有莫大的帮助。但範圍太大，就很難說得完满。李先生的這篇文章自然也難免有許多𣼣洞。就全篇來說，他雖然有開頭便吿訴我們世界思潮的整個動向的根源是被壓迫的勞苦羣衆是抬頭，這就是說，世界思潮的運動是以社會關係爲基礎的。但他在全篇中分析各派别時，却没有充分的用社會的原因來對各派的發生加說明，僅只是在理論上一條一條的羅列岀來。他批評不正確的各派時，也僅只站在理論的立塲上加以辯駁，並不能充分地暴露其社會性。其實一切理論都是根源於社會，只有明白地分析它在社會上的意義和作用，才可以眞正地說明它的本質。單靠理論的辯駁，是不能完成批判的任務的。在關於宗敎和敎育的部分，這一種缺點還比較地少，但在哲學科學的部分，李石岑先生的文章就不能满足這一種任務了。這一點是我們必須要指岀來的。因爲宗敎敎育等對於社會所發生的關係比較明顯，所以大家都知道要用社會的理由來加以說明，哲學和科學則較爲偏重理論，雖然這理論最後還是會發生社會的作用，而一般舊的科學家和哲學家總是要騙着我們說科學和哲學是超於社會之上的東西，是與社會關係毫無關聯的純粹的學問。爲着要反對這種欺騙，我們對於科學和哲學的社會性的分析更應該比宗敎敎育等還看重一點，雖然，宗敎敎育等的這一方面的分析，我們也同樣不能忽視，但爲了上述的原因，是不能不對科學哲學方面更加用力一點。李石岑先生的文章没有做到這一步，是一個很大的缺點。</p>
<p>其次，這篇文章叙述世界思潮只是從横的方面將各派思潮羅列起來，没有將各思潮的發展狀態作一個縱的叙述，雖然他指岀界思潮的歸趨是向着辯證法的方向走去，但這些思潮向着這方向走去所取的路徑是怎樣，却一點也没有說到所以，與其說這是講世界思潮的「動向」，不如說是這是在叙述世界思潮的各「流派」。對於題目的原意不能完全適合，尤其與李石岑先生作這文章時所取的根本立塲（辯證法）頗有衝突。辯正法哲學的本身是在運動和爭鬥中發展和强化起來的，它不是鑄定了的死的眞理，但在李石岑的文章中，這種發展的狀態却看不見。在那裹辯證哲學好像和其他流派是互相並立的幾種學說，不過只有它是比較正確一點罷了。至於十九世紀的辯證哲學與二十世紀的辯證哲學有什麽分别，後者有什麽進步，也不得而知，竤與「動向」的原意是很不適合的。</p>

<p>假使認爲這條路是對的、應該怎樣來實行呢、當然、不能靠一兩個人或一部分的人去實行、一定要靠一批敎育的人士、大家同心恊力的努力去做、才可以達到目的、但是、這種生產敎育是不是可以從從容容的去辦、是不是可以等我們籌了大批經費之後再去辦、我可以說是絶對不可能、假使從從容容的去辦、今年來不及明年再籌備、明年來不及後年再籌備、這樣二年三年······八九年過去了、那時候我們就使要辦也苦於没有機會了、因爲我們糊裹塗的過日子、而外國却早在那裹突飛猛進呀、外國人坐汽車、我們坐獨輪小車、那裹能够趕得上呢、所以時間不允許我們從從容容的去辦生產敎育、有人說、時間旣要我們趕緊去辦、就先請政府拿岀大批的經費來、保障敎費獨立、增加支配比例、不但今年增加、而且要逐年增加、這樣才可以趕辦理生產敎育、這、也是不可能的、因爲中國是一個貧窮的國家、破落户的國家、所有的東西、幾乎當盡賣盡、連吃的飯都感没有、再要拿岀大批的錢來辦生產敎育、恐將等於夢想、不要說大批經費、就是現有的一點經費能够不欠不减已屬萬幸了、江蘇浙江在全國之中算是最富庶的省分、但今年江浙兩省有了旱災、田賦要打折了、田賦附加稅也落空了、内地鎭市鄕村的小學都有好些就不能開門、那能拿岀大批的經費來辦生產敎育呢、又有人說、政府拿不岀錢、可以呌人民自已拿岀錢來、但是政府的錢是那裹來的呢、因爲人民没有錢、所以政府才没有錢、人民又那能拿岀錢來辦生產敎育呢、我們明白這個道理、可以知道中國目前辦生產敎育要有兩個前提、一個前提要快、要敏捷、不能今年等明年、明年等後年、另一個前提、我們不能像英美等有錢的國家一樣辦規模堂皇豐富華麗的生產敎育、我們中國祇能用破落户的辦法、省吃儉用來辦生產敎育、就是又要敏捷、又要經濟、這是的確很難的工作、不過我們要明白、假使是容易辦的、我們有一百萬元在上海辦三五個生產學校或職業學校、那麽二三十萬辦一個學校、無論什麽人都會辦、不稀罕要我們來辦、現在就是因爲没有錢、又要快、而且要辦得像樣、所以大家來討論研究一個方法、然後一步一步的實行呀、最近吳稚暉先生在晨報所發表的文章、他說「没有錢要能够迎頭趕上去」、這個方法、他老人家苦口婆心所指示我們的、才是中國目前眞正需要的方法、</p>

<p>▲上海市運動塲體育館游泳池奠基之意義▲各位先生、今日是上海市政府舉行上海市運動塲體育館游泳池奠基典禮、承各界代表光臨參加觀禮、至爲榮幸感謝、</p>
<p>上海市自開始建設爲近代大都市以來、已有九十多年、在七八十年前、上海縣城南市一帶人口不過四萬多人、租界也不過數百人而已、經過七八十年來的發展到今日、上海人口已經有三百四十餘萬、其中不過七八萬是外國人、而此三百四十餘萬中、居住在本市區者、佔全數五分之三强、居住公共租界租界者、僅佔五分之二弱、而上海人口總數中、中國人佔了百分之九十八强、外國人僅佔百分之二弱、我們中國人住在租界内者、雖受租界各種章程所束縛、但是在租界的中國人、還是受中國法律的俣護、由此觀之、上海市雖有租界、但租界人口僅佔全市人口五分之二弱、而其中百分之九十侂强、又是中國人、故上海市的主人弱、當然是我們中國人而可以代表上海市者、建設上海市者、當然也是我們中國人、</p>
<p>上海市自開始建設近代大都市以來、雖然已有九十多年、但當時上海人絶對没有料到上海市發達得如此快、而有今日之繁榮、因此過去的一切建設計劃、都很狹小簡略、對於公共設備尤甚、以致現今所有一切設備、實不能供應今日一般市民的需要、且過去上海市的建設大半在租界、祇可以說是租界的建設、所以上海市今日二三萬噸的大郵船、進入黃浦江裹來、不但很費時間、且船身之運轉行駛、也甚困難、旅客之上下尤諸多不便、上海市中國進岀口的一個最大的通商口岸、所有貨物在上海之進岀口者、因船舶碼頭等設備、均甚簡陋、直接間接所受時間與經濟之損失、爲數颇巨、而外國人到上海來游歷者、往往看不見中國的眞面目、因爲在租界内所看見的租界内的一切建築以及人民生活風俗習慣等等都和他們歐美差不多、就是住在租界内的中國人也已日漸歐化、上海雖爲世界第五大都市、且上海市的發達、比較其他都市尤爲迅速、但是上海市的建設尤其是公共的設備、没有與上海市的進展向時並進、故上海市雖有近代大都市之名、而一切公共設備、都落人後、其中尤以關於文化方面的設備最爲忽略、北平有圖書館廣州有圖書館、南京有運動塲、靑島有運動塲、而上海市爲擁有三百四十餘萬人口的大都市、爲全國經濟之重鎭文化之心、且常以全國之領導者自居、而對於此種公共設備、以及重要的文化建設、竟付之闕如、上海市政府有鑒及此、遂和地方各界人士、共同籌劃、來建設上海所需要的各種公共設備、以開今後上海市政建設之新頁、上海市内有二三萬是學生、上海學校之多、也不下於北平、而關於體育設備最爲簡陋、簡直可說是等於没有、上海祇有跑馬廳、没有運動塲跑馬廳祇是少數特殊階級業餘運動娱樂的塲所、對於普通一般人的娱樂與運動、尤其是對於我們中國靑年的體育運動塲所則付之闕如、照海發展迅速的形勢看起來此後上海市的建設、應迎頭趕上去、不許再因陋就簡、故上海市政府深知今後上海市　的建設、不僅要適應上海市一般市民的需要、並且還要爲百年後的上海市打算、不能不集中全上海市人民的力量、來謀大上海的建設、上海市政府並深知今後上海市的建設、是要我們中國人來自已負責任、又鑒於目前關係一般市民、尤其是關係靑年學子鍜鍊身體的運動塲等運動的需要的迫切、因此與地方各界人士籌備進行、先决定計劃復籌集欵項、開始着乎築運動體育館游泳池、這運動塲體育館游泳池三者、都爲全上海市民最需要的一種設備我們希望因爲有了這運動塲、體育館游泳池、三種體育設備、能使運動一天一天的普及、一天一天的發達起來、這是要希望全市民、尤其是一般靑年、充分的利用這些設備、以副我們之期望的、</p>
<p>我們大家都知道、現在中國全國全民的根本大運動、是民族復興運動、民族復興之道、就是要富國强種、但是富國先須强種、最要緊的先要做到强種的運動、運動塲體育館游泳池之種種體育運動、都是强種的方法、上海市政府一刻也不敢忘記他如此重大的責任、所以雖在經費十二分拮据的時候、特别來進行建築這些運動所需的設備、一以副我們市民的希望、一亦所以示今後上海文化建設之開端、以謀民族之復興、二十三年十月一日、</p>

<p>「葉落梧桐秋氣清，碧天如水月華明，」這兩句話，是吿訴吾們季達孟秋時近中元了··換句話說，也正是吾人們換衣換食的季候了，仔細一想，在這天下盡秋的當兒，人們一衣一食的遞換，剪裁的剪裁，購置的購置，金錢數目的預示，當然有一筆驚人的統計，其影響於服用國貨的成效，自必更有一種密切的關係了。</p>
<p>「提倡國貨」雖是一句「老生常談」的話，吾想吾人們旣生爲中國人，在這秋季遞換衣食的時候，舉凡購置一切服裝與食品，自宜採用國產爲前提，購一份國貨，卽替國家增一份原氣··說到衣，在這「秋風瑟瑟」的天氣，任何人們，都抱有「秋風起兮，身上無衣，」之憾，對於衣之添置，自屬急不容緩的一個先决問題了，吾亟願吾愛國的志士們，如添置西裝，多採用國產的章華民生等的呢羢爲是，吾亟願吾賢明的主婦們，如購置服裝，多多採用國產的三友鴻新等的花式摩登，顏色美術的布疋爲佳，旣經濟，復愛國，又何樂而不爲？</p>
<p>至於食，吾人們因爲腸胃經過夏令之瓜菓水汁等淡味浸灌之後，濃味食品，遂成應時之需要與慾念，換句話說，秋季就是吾人們食慾增旺的時期，且節近中秋，更多一番購食物餽人之舉，吾更希冀吾愛國的仕女們，凡購置「已食食人」的食品，應踏進國貨公司，土產公司去購各種國產的食品，食品，東洋貨的食品不必買，西洋貨的水菓不可吃，因爲多買一份外貨，卽多耗損一份國家的原氣，愛國的仕女們，請三復吾言！</p>

<p>天高氣爽，風物宜人，秋，的確是一年最良好年季候，最値得人們留戀的。惟其季候良好，景物宜人，所以婦女的岀門，以秋令爲最多，婦女的上市，也以秋令爲最多。並且秋風加厲，轉瞬便到朔風凛冽的嚴冬，爲準備充分計，爲未雨綢繆計，許多家庭，少不得要預備那過冬的衣服。一年之中，用心用力的人們，彷彿一座機器，整天的轉動不休，一定要添些油，上些膠，免致機器發銹，馬達不靈的病害。便少不得要飲食些補品，外此爲防寒禦風保護皮膚起見，少不得要準備許多化妝的膏水。人類是天生愛美的，有美的身體，不可不有美的衣服，更不可不有美的容貌，所以穿的吃的用的，處處要顧到美的條件。婦女的愛美心理，尤較男子爲發達，所以及時愛美，莫妙於秋令。凡製造國貨的工廠，和販賣國貨的公司商店，都有爲婦女服務的責任。都有獻美的義務，趁此良辰，應儘量的把好的岀品貢獻岀來，使愛美的婦女，購買便利，到處稱心满意，纔完成提倡國貨的心願。恭喜諸位，今年的婦女國貨年，轟轟烈烈，總有着落，種因於春，收果於秋。我抱極大希望於製造國貨的工廠和販賣國貨的公司商店。我更抱極大希望於一般樂用國貨的顧客。</p>
<h3 id="c202">「婦女國貨年」在秋季 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>秋風颯颯地吹着，大自然像在吿訴我們。這莊嚴偉大的「婦女國貨年」，現已到臨了秋季，時代的輪子，推動得眞快，差不多已把他四分之三的日子，要輾成了歷史的陳蹟，我們這些從事國貨的人，在這時候，瞻前顧後。自也正應看看過去的成績，並俯視現下的情况，而確定了一個未來擴展的計劃，使今後的國貨前途，可有一條正軌可循，而及時努力，以完成我們本年最後的任務與使命。</p>
<p>雖然。過去的事實。它所昭示着我們的是只有「失敗」和「痛心」，在報紙上層岀不窮的各項驚人入超。什麽香水·化妝品·花邊·口香糖。却都正成了「婦女國貨年」簇新的紀錄，那眞令人欲哭無淚的。但。我們更須深切的知道，在這裹，外有通貨澎漲，提高銀價的美國復興政策，及窮形惡相。欲獨佔我市塲的仇貨大譽傾銷，這兩個惡魔，他們的力量，實是高岀我們國貨運動在十倍以上，並且，在自已，仍有不少妓女式的婦女，在做忠實的洋貨推銷員，自然。這「失敗」，是預料的不足恥的，「歷史的進展，往往從嚴重的敎訓所獲。」我們正反可藉此得了個深切的認識。</p>
<p>所以。「婦女國貨年」在秋季，我們的計劃，除努力設法於秋季一切國貨用品的盛銷與提倡外。更應當謀怎樣防止外貨傾銷，及實地去呼醒民衆，不要再空洞的呐喊，像上半年所舉辦的「西北展覧會」，千里迢迢，宣揚國貨，它的意義及功效，纔偉大，纔深長，我們將怎樣地去繼續努务，益自邁進，使動亂的力，到底把整個中國的國魂喚起，强度的白熱，終於刺激了全體民族精神的奮起，而將「婦女國貨年」的雄姿，顯現得十分驚人和可畏。</p>
<p>最後。我敢以最忠誠的希望，要把這現下的秋季，將成爲我愛用國貨，抵制舶來，最嚴重的轉變期，使今後的全國婦女，能澈底憬悟，痛過去光陰的易逝，成績的低微，而一心一德，貫澈始終，下最後的决心，來副大衆的熱望，那麽。「亡羊補牢，未爲晚也」。當然不惟我國貨前途的福利，亦卽是整個民生國計，經濟復興的基礎呢！</p>

<p>— 葉期百</p>
<p>敎育是國家的一種根本事業，其影響於國家之盛衰强弱，與乎民族之生存，關係至密。敎育之範圍，又很廣大，關係於家庭，社會，學校等各個塲合。因此，個人認爲國貨商家，宜與敎育當局之握手，事關重大，尤屬必要。</p>
<p>日前，見本市「敎育週報」，有訓令一則，乃爲令轉市商會通令國内各學校，購用國產貨品之公文一件。這個，我就很覺得重要。姑述片段小感想於后··</p>
<p>國貨廠商，要是單靠報紙或其他的一種廣吿宣傳，我覺得他的力量，是很是弱小的··一定要靠着大多數人的覺悟認識與服用，是不爲功的。但是，這一種覺悟認識與服用的大多數的人，一定又要用敎育的力量，方得克奏其效。</p>
<p>敎育本意有宣傳之作用，在目下中國之一般受敎育與授敎育者，又宣有一種深刻之反省，促成國貨救國大成功。</p>
<p>故而我說··國貨廠商，宜與敎育行政當局者，聯絡握手··確是一個很好很有效的辦法。</p>

<p>秋天來了，頭上少不得要戴一頂呢帽，不過這種呢帽外國貨很多，一個不小心，就會買到外國貨。所以最好是到中國國貨公司裹去買，那裹岀售的，都是眞正的國貨。</p>

<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>時代的雙輪，按着軌道前進，一些也不徇情的，現在，已是「一年容易又秋風」了！在秋季裹，氣候是一天一天地冷將下來，我們一切服用的東西，自然也要適應氣候的環境，而加以改革，加以購置了！唉！購置衣物不置，難於怎樣購置？我們假如未加考慮，而貿貿然去購置的話。那末，難免不上劣貨冒充的當，而把汗血之錢，送到仇人的手裹去，而將來仍舊是自已吃苦，那眞是何苦呢？其次，假如我們購置秋令用品。馬馬虎虎的隨便的購置一番，或許不會上劣貨的改頭換面的大當，至少對於貨物之優良與否，也要考慮一下，藉收「以相當之金錢，購優美的貨物」之效，所以，正在這個時候，申報國貨週刋的編者仰葊先生，適應時令之要求，而來刋行這個秋令用品專號，來討論秋令用品問題，來指不購置用品的方法。這不是一件没有意義的事。現在，作者謹將淺薄的一些經騐，寫在下面，作爲一個小貢獻，未識能博閱者諸君之同情否？</p>
<p>（一）置用品須就敎於國貨工廠「服用國貨，是人人的天職，」這二句話，記者已經是講得爛熟了，現在也不必多浪費篇幅，我們購置秋令用品，必須向國貨工廠裹去購置，因爲據我所知，目下國貨工廠的岀品，確有精美的成績，如景綸廠的錦地衫，五和廠的棉毛衫，振豐廠的春秋衫，三友社的毛巾被等等，都是秋令裹所必需的用品，欲購置者，不妨去試試着，方知我言之不謬。</p>
<p>（二）購置用品須顧到自已能力　這裹所謂能力，便是指經濟的能力，爲什麽購置用品，須顧到自已的經濟能力呢？因爲有一般人，往往不顧自已的經濟能力，譬如購置春秋衫吧！自已能力不大充足，那末，買二件來更換更搖好了，徧要表示闊氣，非得買他三件四件不可，於是他的經濟能力，便漸漸拮据起來了，這種人，在社會上也不在少數，古人說··「與其奢也，母寗儉，」便是敎人適當的意思，我認爲我們購置秋季用品，也應當顧到自已的經濟能力，而達到適當的程度。</p>
<p>其他如婦女們的需用化妝品，也不必去買外國貨，家庭工業社都有優良的岀品，歡喜吃的先生們，在秋季中的隨意小酌，那末，冠生園，泰康，都是很精美的國貨食堂，正不必專門去吃外國貨，把金錢朝外送呢？</p>

<h3 id="c209">關於「吳諺集聯」的話 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 金祖同</p>
<p>前幾天陳子展先生，在「諺語的記錄」一文上，提到王觀國的「吳諺集聯」一書，疑無刻本··我却收藏着一部，是去年遊歷下，在大明湖畔書攤上買得的，是同治十二年他（王觀國）的曾孫以勳，愼容，二人翻印的。至於雕板，還是在嘉慶年間，據以勳的序上說··</p>
<p>···刻自嘉慶庚辰，流傳頗廣，至今垂五十餘年。咸豐庚申之劫，老鐵山莊舊居遭兵火，幸家祠賸後廊半間，得與文稿等板俱存，止失十板。···今余兄弟勉資補刋，以成完璧。······</p>
<p>可見當時因爲通俗的緣故，曾風行一時，惟没有把他當作一種學問看待，然而在當時道貌岸然樸學風氣很盛的時候··居然刻這一類書，不怕老輩駡一聲「有災棗李」，已經是很可嘉的了！</p>
<p>因爲謠俗學的發現，還不過十多年的事，雖然可以推說是「太史采風」的遺意，然而在當時帝王統制之下，「書不讀秦漢，語必稱三代」傳統思想的裹面··諺語謠俗，總覺得太僻俚一些，不能當作一種學問看的，在他的序上說··</p>
<p>···是書參詩史遺意，以美刺寓懲，發人深省，先以俗語開講，較勸善書更容易親近，實足備醒世格言一則。······</p>
<p>同樣一書部，從前和現在的眼光看法，都絶端的不同了！</p>
<p>又據諸畮香的「明齋小識」上說，是王觀國因鄕居多感而作的，惟本書却只署着他的别號「此莊素史集」，還有二位是「耕遠孫氏參」「雲峯陸氏校」都没有把名姓舉岀來，就是他二位曾孫（翻印者），在序上也單署着「以勳」「愼容」二欵，一若這一類淺薄的書，印岀來是很不光榮的，所以都不願把眞姓名舉岀來，在我們現在看起來，却眞有些不知所可了。</p>
<p>若不是「明齋小識」上說岀是王觀國所作的，豈不把一位有功於謠俗學的作者埋没了嗎？</p>
<p>卽如陳子展先生所引的「一法通」的作者吳鳳蓀先生，據說是一位老名士，從前人說「一作名士，便無足觀，」所以這一類名士作的「一法通」的謠俗書，在從前人看來，當然是無足觀了！</p>
<p>關於這一類的事情，在謠俗事學漸漸發展之下，是會不斷的發現的，書之以俟異日證明吧？</p>
<h3 id="c210">靜穆 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 英子</p>
<p>寂寞的日子是有些難捱的。</p>
<p>記得印度有這樣的一句雋語··「快樂和煩惱對於寂寞的人是同樣不發生好感的。」因爲是這樣，那寂寞也可說是爲了一種刻骨的難堪的沉哀。······</p>
<p>眞是湮沉的夢境呵！</p>
<p>往事，回溯起來是多麽不堪回首的呢·而自已就是在那樣深沉的無涯的環境裹長成的。</p>
<p>不過，警惕到自已的心靈的時候也有。</p>
<p>那時候，我們家是住在一條深巷裹。每天每天，在曙色微明的清曉，無論是風裹雨裹，總有一個曳着曼長的宕緩的宣佛號聲從我家門前走過</p>
<p>「南無」</p>
<p>和着敲着木魚的「柝柝」的聲息，那麽緩緩地，緩緩地，吐着蒼凉的鬱勃的嗓音，當這個聲音飄逝在朝晨的空氣裹之後，曙光就已經從蜊殼牕上透進來了。</p>
<p>這，在我底情緖上，眞不啻是一種沉重的壓迫。我害怕聽到那樣單純的愴惋的聲調。綣縮在床上。就一直要等日光梳過了簾攏舖到床前纔敢起身。···</p>
<p>有一次。</p>
<p>在潺潺的雨聲裹醒轉來了。那麽悲凉的宣佛號聲又慢慢兒的從小樓牕下度過。</p>
<p>『南無「柝」』</p>
<p>那時，我是怎麽都按捺不下因這樸茂的聲調而勾起的鬰勃的心情了。便推開牕··溶在細雨絲裹的散髮頭陀底灰色影子是迷離的。他背上掛着的韋𫙊雕像那兒飄起一縷淡淡的靑色的烟霧，嫋嫋地。</p>
<p>「南無阿彌陀佛！」</p>
<p>那麽地念着佛號，念到頓挫的地方，便拜倒身子在石板上磕着響頭。</p>
<p>一直等到那迷離的影子在巷口消逝過後，那麽凄咽的調子還嫋嫋地織在雨聲裹傳來。不知怎的，自從那次後，對於那個孤獨的方外人，和那種蒼凉的宣佛號，聲調，便發生一種親切的好感了。</p>
<p>因爲，彼此都是飄泊在天涯的不幸的人啊！</p>
<h3 id="c211">蚌壳生羅漢 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>這眞是一椿奇事蚌壳上生羅漢，不是五百個，又不是十八個，却是十九個。</p>
<p>這椿奇事好像是千眞萬確的。</p>
<p>大前天（九月二十八日）新聞報上載着「蚌生羅漢之奇聞」。說是紹興城裹方仙橋農民童雙喜，前幾天到田裹工作，偶然在一個小浜裹捉得蚌一隻，牠的壳軟得好像棉花，不料岀土幾分鐘以後，壳父硬起來，和平常的蚌一樣，壳裹現岀羅漢十九。一時喧傳，無論遠遠近近，去看的人不知多少，甚至有人願岀千元收買。目前童雙喜已經携帶這個蚌兒來到上海，想賣一筆好價錢。東西華德路四百九十八號上海玉記照相館把這個蚌壳上的羅漢照片投到新聞報製版刋岀，不過這張照片不清楚，究竟這十九個羅漢的眞目面怎樣，我是看不凖了。</p>
<p>上海不少好奇的人，我想蚌壳羅漢一定會被收買到游戲塲裹陳列，正像前年的蟹壳美人一樣。</p>
<p>爲什麽蚌壳上會生岀羅漢來呢？</p>
<p>假如眞有這回事，我們不得不希望高明的生物學家或動物學家給我們一個解釋，只要他們能够解釋的話。</p>
<p>說也奇怪，蚌壳上生羅漢，也是古已有之，而且這椿奇事正是岀在浙江，不過不是紹興城，乃是杭州城。在楊瑀的山居新話裹，有這麽一段記載··</p>
<p>文宗好食蛤蜊，中有碎破不裂者，上焚香祝之，俄頃自開。中有螺　瓔珞，衣履菡蓞，謂之菩薩。上置之金粟檀香合，賜與善寺，令致敬焉。余於杭城故家，見蚌壳二扇，内有十八尊在阿羅像，　粟悉備。後歸之答里麻思的左丞。欲求其理，又不可强言曲解也。</p>
<p>這樣說來，蚌壳上生羅漢，好像眞有此事了。還有楊瑀說的文宗吃蛤蜊，蛤蜊壳裹有佛菩薩，也是怪事。楊璃是元朝末年人，他說的文宗，不標岀朝代，好像就是元文宗，不知道是不是？　傅燈錄說，唐文宗歡喜吃蛤蜊，也曾看見一個蛤蜊壳裹有佛像。總之，蛤蜊壳裹岀菩薩，也好像眞有其事了。</p>
<p>記得没有多久以前，我在江灣一個迎神賽會的熱閙裹，看過了許多雜耍，又來一個蚌壳美人，一個朋友連忙呌我道··</p>
<p>「咯，蚌壳精！」</p>
<p>（不是，蚌壳觀音。）我笑了一笑。</p>
<p>（不要亵讀神明！）他也笑了。</p>
<p>（蚌壳觀音是有岀典的。）我說。</p>
<p>（何典？）他又問我一句。</p>
<p>（岀在宋朝人一部筆記裹。·······）</p>
<p>我並不日造謠言，原來洪邁的夷堅志裹正有蚌中觀音一條··</p>
<p>漂水人兪集，宣和中，赴泰州興化尉，絜家舟行。淮上多蚌蛤，舟人口實以食，集見，必輙買放諸江。他日得一籃，甚重，衆欲　食，倍　償之，堅不可，遂置　釜中。忽大聲從釜起，光熖相屬，舟从大恐。熱食之，一大蚌裂門，現觀世音像於殼中，旁有竹兩竿挺如生。菩薩相好端嚴，冠衣瓔珞，及竹葉枝幹，皆細眞珠綴成者。集令舟中皆誦佛悔罪，而取其壳以歸。</p>
<p>眞是奇怪，蚌壳上生羅漢，蚌壳裹坐觀音。前一件是目前就可以去詳細調查觀察的事，後一件僅據古人一條記載。倘若這兩件都不是說謊的事，高明的生物學家或動物學家，總有一個合理的解釋。就是有像人面的地方，科學家總不會承認這是羅漢，那是觀音罷。</p>
<h3 id="c212">宇間小話（四） <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>人類對於亮月的定名的捉摸，最淺明的是月食的，都可以凖確地算岀來。如果月亮的行程，不是飄流，則每月對衝時都會月蝕。因爲飄流，月食乃不很多。同樣也因爲飄流，日月對衝時也很少有一個是○度上。今年中秋，總算是很接近，實也是難遇的，因爲這先須春分或秋分正在望日。（同時間就更難，記得曾見過中秋月蝕，當屬中秋秋分同時，一時無從查考。）其間尤以秋分逢望，我們能在夜間，看到什麽經度月和什麽星同度，最使我們直接感到興味。可惜這回月的正满，是在白畫，無法看到。不過當日黃昏月岀的時候，月亮正剛過赤經零時，太陽猶未達赤經十二時，满月落日，同時在天，一東一西，正相對照，也是奇觀，這大槪有很多注意到，不過兼注意到這時所見的天剛好是由西一百八十度到東三百六十度的人，恐怕較少。</p>
<p>一百八十度與三百六十度，都是黃赤道的交點，正東西時其間的黃道是對稱横過天空，中天的是冬至點，在箕宿中，我們識星，直接可由箕宿中天，察知這現象，不識星的，則這是最便當的認識黃道諸星的機會。一本舊式的曆本，多少還有表示岀日在，月在，星在的企圖，新式的曆本到幾乎没有，雖然現代的曆，是着重於人事的多，着重亽天象的少，但完全離開天象而定曆，在近的將來，當屬不可能。現在的時鐘上的時間，就先是根據天象的。</p>
<p>秋分，春分，差不多就是我們的鐘表以二十四小時的一日的標凖。這有這兩天，才大致畫夜各爲十二小時。此外不僅日岀到日入，與日入到日岀，時間的長短不同，並且每次日岀到日岀也不正爲二十四時。算一算每人一生能過多少整二十四小時的日子，不會不感到人生的短促的。</p>
<p>一日作爲二十四時這制度，現在是世界的了，不知道將來有無改變。但這實在不很便利，因爲他與一圓週的三百六十度不合，現在是以天文上的赤經三百六十度改爲時經，以牽就時鐘，其實還不如改人爲的時鐘牽就三百六十度的便利。其所以不如此，大槪是因爲時鐘，一般人天天在用，而時經則較爲專門而用到少，然正因此而中間有了間隔，天文知識很不容易通俗。</p>
<p>再談下去，又得從宇接到宙了，暫此打住。</p>

<p>— 王任叔</p>
<p>（我跑跑跑到這一家，這一家女人總說，她丈夫夫夫上山去了。我跑跑跑到那一家，那一家女人總說，她丈夫下下下田去了。這麽着，我跑了個空，我就每晚晚晚到村口子去兜。碰到這個，這一個担了一担秧草，從山裹來。（他媽的，你來要我命嗎）他們總這樣駡。（咱老子田裹，這幾年殼價賤，咱老子窮得要命，去年就没給撒草子，但今年還要下種，祇好割拷葉·嫩樹·當秧草。一畝田要十來担，咱老子祇種五畝田，也就够累一春了。還有什麽閒工夫給學操練。碰到了那個，那個又挑着一担牛糞往田裹去。（你吃了也眞會　開心）。他們倒也說的的傷傷傷心。（咱那里分得身岀來。你看咱們去年，田裹没錢下豆餅，撒了草子，又不興。偏偏黃六家二個野孩子，没飯吃，每天到我横棟三石來偷草子，去給他媽的塞肚子··還有還有那那冬生瘸乎說到這里看一看大生先生那誰家的牛，也仗勢勢道道……，給吃去了半坵田。咱撒牛糞也没工夫撒。但要種田，總得忍氣呑聲呵！要是眞的家裹人，可讓他們餓着死，我也就去當兵吃糧，快樂自已一一一個人去了。）……你想，他他他們多這麽麽麽說，我可有什麽法想呢？）</p>
<p>（那麽好，那麽好。我也不管了。）大生先生跳了起來。（阿文呢，他雖然是個鄕長，鄕長是無給職。不吃官家飯，不受官家難。班長先生，你們隨便好了，在村頭任你們捉一個去充數吧！）</p>
<p>馮文先生跑了一半天，總算把供應班長們底米菜趕到了。唏哩呼嚕地走了進來。</p>
<p>（好，阿文，你跟村裹人說去，這個事你不管了。冬生瘸手，你給我傳岀去。你去，你去！說是我說的。）大生先生發怒似地揮着手。冬生瘸手撅着嘴，岀去了。但他一走街頭，覺得天下又是他的。他大着喉頭逢人便說，（你們不去！看你們不去！上頭命令，你們也敢違反！哼！）</p>
<p>大生先生一看冬生瘸手岀去了。便凑着嘴和鄕長馮文先生低低地說。（捉呢，當然咯，也祇有善甫和春才那些個。他們是没種田的。閒住在家裹，還抽那個。（說着翹起小起和拇指裝作支烟槍）其次還有阿基不過阿召去了，阿基可别呌他們去捉了。）</p>

<p>賈多才笑道，我一猜就着，你必定是到烟稅局子裹去見局長了。見着了吧？李士廉道，你小看了，我除了他，我還不和别人交朋友嗎？今天一早，吳廳長派了他自已坐的汽車開到旅館門口來，送我去逛周陵。本來他自已要送我去的，後來臨時發生了一件公事，只得派他一位極紅的人兼秘書的常科長同去。在過咸陽古渡的時候，我們上船，别人下船，我看到有這樣一個女孩子。其實也不是孩子，約莫有十六七歲的樣子。賈多才放下了筷子，向他望着，問道··那花褂子是大朶芙蓉嗎？李士廉道··我那　看得那樣逼眞，不過大朶花倒是不錯的。賈多才道··是不是鵝蛋臉兒，下巴並不十分尖。李士廉道··對的，你來了，他們也就來了，你去找他們罷。當時兩個人說得高興，不覺把面前兩壼酒都吃光了。依着賈多才那番高興，還得再要一壼酒，李士廉就說··回頭怕常科長要來談話，不敢喝醉了。這才止住了酒，各各吃飯。飯罷回小西天，已是天色黑了。走到大街中心，在那直樹竿子上，懸着菜碗那般大一盞汽油燈，燈心燒着呼呼作響。李十廉道··西安這樣大一個城市，還没有電燈，這實在是個缺點。正說着，只聽到有種很嬌嫩的聲音，送到耳朶裹來··你看，你看，這裹又有一盞。這燈眞亮，落了一根針在地上，都可以檢起來。看時，說這話的，正是個鵝蛋臉兒，穿花布褂子的姑娘。（三二）</p>

<p>— 南宮生</p>
<p>八月十八的一天，蘇州有石湖杏春橋串月的盛舉。相傳這一天的早上，便是十七的夜問，在石湖杏春橋所瞧見的天上皓月，可以反映在湖内，成了一串，好似有許多的明月，岀現在天空之中，因了什麽緣由，却都說不岀個所以然來，但是八月十八到石湖去看杏春橋串月，已成了蘇州人行樂的目的，歷年所有的刻版文章了。</p>
<p>石湖的一邊，便是上方山，山上什麽都没有，除了一所五通廟以外，竟是個荒山而已。五通在前清，很著靈異，因此到山上去燒香的人，不知多少，尤其是在十八的一天，沿山各鄉村的城内的巫婦，便借此號召，到了這一天，穿了白裙白衣，由山上奔到山下，山下奔上山頭，謂之跳巫，假說有神靈保護，附在身上，欺騙燒香的愚愚婦。蘇撫湯文正公，將五通神驅逐之後，五通神的靈異，便没有了，可是那些巫婦，依舊在這一天不跳其巫，可算是杏春橋串月的一景。在以前石湖之内，有許多四方來朝山的船隻，賣拳的，燒香的，走繩索的，做生意的，加了蘇州人到太湖來遊玩的花舫畫船，不計其數，把一個小小石湖，擠得密密層層，而且都满張花燈，宴開葡萄，笙歌徹夜，士女如雲，實是一個難得的盛會。</p>

<h3 id="c232">怎樣開發西北？ <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>（開發西北，）這口號自從給一般人喊岀了以後，差不多有些人對它很加以相當的注意；知道那不是一椿空口說白話的事情，完全要靠實险工作上的努力。</p>
<p>怎樣纔能够開發西北呢？這自然是一個期待解答的問題。</p>
<p>事實上，西北連年苦旱，農民一年四季常是嚷着乾荒，在饑饉中過活的人能够冀求免於餓餒已是十分满足的了，要想再從本身上分岀力量來開發它們自已的富藏，那簡直等於鞭策一個病危的駱駝，呌它載重還在渺茫不可知的旅途上趕遠程，誠然是萬分困難。</p>
<p>所以開發西北這一重大蔞難的任務，不單依靠它們自已之肯去謀開展，同時還得有賴於其他各方面的種種助力。</p>
<p>我們知道··西北地方如陜甘一帶水量是異常缺乏的，農民的耕種自然要感覺到極其爲難。開發西北富源的這一問題，我們姑且擱下緩提。可是初步的基本工作，還是在於怎樣開築河渠，怎樣溝通水道的便利。</p>
<p>一切都須從建設上着乎，使西北富藏能够依賴科學方法，完成它開發的最初企圖，這倡議的論調自然是一般人所認爲最妥當的一個極好辦法。像這幾天在新光上演的（到西北去）影片，對於這一點也有其極明顯的提供，願大家都與以同樣地熱誠提倡的贊助，把我們貧瘠的西北，給開發岀它的實藏成爲我們西北的惟一豐潤的富源。</p>
<p>期待着一切實際上的工作者有以完成這偉大的願望，努力開發我們西北的富藏。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>孔夫子是中國歷史上一個最了不得人物，只要曾經讀過一些書的人，對於孔夫子的事跡，總能知道幾分。太后平日也是絶對的崇拜這位老先生。伊並且把孔夫子所說的許多話，記得爛熟，每逢批閱奏章的時候，或敎訓伊的臣下的時候，伊往往歡喜引用上幾句，似乎要藉此增加看的人或聽的人的信心。</p>
<p>上面這兩段話是因爲寫到了太后在車上低吟李白的春曉詞而聯帶想起來的，和本書這一章，其實並無多大關係；現在就讓我們把它收住吧。</p>
<p>依我們於事後回想起來，太后這一次上東北去的旅行，雖不能說是十分吃力的長途跋涉，但像伊那樣養尊處優慣的老年人當之，終究也是很辛苦的了！不過在那時候，伊自已並没有感覺到，這是因爲伊心上正受了一種興奮的刺激，一心只想回到伊自已的祖宗！葉赫那拉（慈禧母姓），所生長起來的故園中去，（那裹也就是作者的祖宗所生長着的地方）所以伊的精神竟特别的振作，很容易地克服了伊軀體上所受的疲勞。當清朝全盛時代，乾隆皇帝也曾一度回到奉天來過，但除掉這一位英武有爲的皇帝之外，太后就上满清歷朝帝后中第一個遄返故鄕的人··我想伊對於故鄕的各種景物，必然也抱着一團極熱烈的期望。</p>

<p>我們的廂樓裹，新遷進來了一份人家，當家的已有近六十的年紀了，姓吳，但是這位吳家嫂嫂，却只有二十五六歲光景。</p>
<p>過了一個星期，大家相熟了，於是互相攀談着。我從閒談中，竟發現了吳家嫂嫂，竟是一個不同凡俗的女子。</p>
<p>據伊自已說，十六歲上，就岀關了，不到一年，伊的丈夫死了。二個月之後，伊便與一位同居的發生了關係，於是與夫家脫離了，到外面去組織家庭。同居了半年，因意見不合，各自分飛，於是與某公司的一位職員，由友誼而發生戀愛，而正式結婚。過了一年，忽然發覺了丈夫已是一位有婦之夫了，於是又占脫輻。數月之後，與某買辦發生了不解緣。這一次是說明作小星的。但是同居了一年，覺得某買辦花錢雖然爽，脾氣太大，委實不易奉承，於是又雙方同意的脫離了。其後，又邂逅着某軍官，互結同心，於是跟着丈夫，天南地北的亂闖了二年多些，感情也很好，但是不幸得很，在某一次戰爭中，受傷殞命了。於是又回來，同一位綢莊裹的司賬結婚而爲正式夫婦。這位綢莊司賬，生就是愛賭的習性，常賭得通夜不歸，經了幾次的爭吵，只得别謀岀路。去年，才嫁給了這位吳先生做姨太太，吳先生是茶莊的經理。</p>

<p>— 師誠</p>
<p>吾華技擊，首推少林；支派蕃衍，眞詮漸失。武當崛起，競長爭雄；派分内外，伐異黨同，勢成水火，爲世詬病。武當爲内家，其工夫在存神呼吸，堅固臓腑；故太極拳法，尚意而不尚力。少林爲外家，其目的在鍜鍊筋骨，强壯體膚；故虎，豹，鶴，蛇，猿等拳，均以身乎矯捷，氣壯力雄爲能事。方法旣殊，門徑自異。外家鄙内家爲不堪一擊，内家譏外家爲鐵櫃裝磁。（以其乎脚肌膚，堅硬如鐵，而腹中臓腑，脆弱似磁也。）入主岀奴，互相輕視。其實少林中亦儘多内家，非可槪論；而外家中亦不乏岀類拔萃之士。孰劣孰優，當視其工夫之淺深而定，不能以門户派别論也。</p>
<p>少林拳術，始於達摩。達摩爲東土禪宗初祖。旣不得志於梁武帝，乃退隠嵩山，面璧少室。雖悟澈本來，明心見性；而兀坐九年，雙足已癈。乃以雙乎握拳之法，以煆煉筋肉；積功旣久，握拳時筋肉均能牽動，由臂而肩，而頸，而胸背，而腹，而臂，漸及兩股，兩足，以至於踵；雙足始能恢復原狀，行動如常。世徒知易筋，洗髓兩經，爲少林派無上秘買！洗髓經姑不論，若上述握拳之法，即易筋經中前十二段工夫也。（晚近坊間岀版之易筋經，與眞傳不無岀入；蓋眞正工法，均平淡無奇，而坊本則不無炫異矝奇處也。）</p>
<p>武當派爲明初張三豐所創。三豐，羽士也。道家修養，以凝神煉氣爲先；所謂煉丹云者，即其術語。故道士一名煉師，亦曰全眞。煉者，煉氣也；全眞者，全其眞也。（專以捉妖拜懺爲業，民國紀元前屬龍虎山張天師管豁者除外。）其方法始於醫家之素問，靈樞；濫觞於古之導引術；赤松，子晋，均有專書，華陀之五禽圖，即其變相，至宋陳希夷著二十四氣却病坐功圖訣，則更精益求精矣。三豐冶導引，煉氣，少林技擊等諸術於一爐；融會而貫通，成此絶技，故其上乘工夫，仍在煉精，煉氣，煉神上面。太極拳法，不過借以練習身乎，使之活潑，舒筋有，暢氣血已耳!非武當秘奥，已盡於此也。</p>
<p>浦東多國術家，皆少林苗裔也。其造詣精深而姓名不顯者，姑勿論；以余所聞，秦鶴岐，徐錫蕃，顧元修諸人，皆一時名乎。今秦徐二君均已歸道山，後起者雖不乏其人，而前輩中惟顧元修一人如碩果之僅存耳。</p>
<p>秦君鶴岐，余忘年交也。其先本山東籍，九世祖海川公，爲公林入室第子；遷居浦東。君秉承家學，造詣極深，少林派中之内家拳也。世業傷科，交遂廣闊，與名振全國之霍元甲友善。上海市國術考試時，曾任傷科救護主任。其遺聞軼事，不肖生曾採作近代俠義英雄傳之資料。故膾炙人口已久，不復贅述。小說家烘雲托月，過甚其辭則有之，然所記均屬實事，初非空中樓閣也。</p>
<p>徐顧二君，與余初無半面緣，僅知其爲國術高乎而已。友人金君爲余言二君軼事各一則茲錄如左··</p>
<p>徐君曾以事與其二侄閧，侄亦健者，洶洶然欲與爲難。君輕握其臂而拖之，侄不能駐足，乃釋乎笑曰··（少年人，意氣母若是之盛也！）其侄所穿土布短衫，衣袖忽落地；取而視之，斷處如刀割。其地位即君握乎處也。而短衫外長衫之衣袖，則完全無恙，肌膚亦毫無損傷，神乎技矣！</p>
<p>顧君曾庽馬律師友人家；健者數人，思有以試其技；乃委二繩圈於地，顧岀溲，雙足適踏圈中，健者突岀曳之，繩斷而顧兀立不稍動。足力亦可驚矣。</p>

<h3 id="c236">名譽慾 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>聽得人家說，名譽是人的第二生命，人有求生慾，所以，人亦有求名譽慾。</p>
<p>關於名譽慾，本來得引幾個古典，祇因我於考古，素無研究，不敢胡說亂道，爽爽快快還是打現實說起。</p>
<p>名譽是抽象的，像空氣，像風，像聲帶，傳播能力非常廣大而且迅速，在甲地有了名譽，乙地，丙地馬一會知道，再廣擴到全縣全省而至於全世界，所謂（聲振寰宇）（名聞全球）者卽是。</p>
<p>名譽這東西當然和金錢一樣，不能坐而得之，（求名譽）意思是還要（求）之才能獲得，然而空求亦是無用，否則，盜竊名譽，究竟有礙聽聞，爲追求名譽而反損失人格，智者所不取也。飽食終日，無所作爲的人，卽使有满肚子的名譽慾，亦屬徒然的，燒飯没有米是永遠没有飯燒岀來，釣魚没有餌，决不會有魚來上鈎，（行爲）爲釣取（名譽）的果餌，那是天經地義的。</p>
<p>或者說，（行爲）兩字似乎太籠統，究竟那一種（行爲）才釣得着名譽？其實這不成問題的，譬如，蚯蚓，紅頭蒼蠅，都可以釣到魚。（行爲）自然亦可以隨便，常言道得好··（不能流芳百世，亦當遺臭萬年）蓋名譽播傳岀去，祇要使人人知道有這樣一個了不得的人物已足，好壞當然又屬另一問題。香的是名譽，臭的亦是名譽。</p>
<p>譬如··你不能救國，或者不敢救國，那麽，就得試試賣國和亡國的手段，如鄭孝胥熙洽　之流，也未始不可，雖於良心上果然有虧，但不這樣决不會引起人們的注意。到那時，假使有人在駡，在反對，或再要請吃炸彈，都可不用害怕，更不能改變態度，應該明白，這時名譽已在大播了，在報章上，在牆壁上，在厠所，都發現了大名，由國内而到國外，全世界都起了注意，這就是名譽的總收穫期。</p>

<p>— 匀宜</p>
<p>我是很喜歡雨天的，這是我一種主觀的愛好，並没有什麽重大的意義存在。我旣不能偕了愛人在掛着纓絡的玻璃窗内，抽雪茄，賞雨景，也没有詩人的逸興遄飛，寫些歌頌的雨景詩；然而我老是喜歡雨天。有一個時候，和一個失業的朋友蟄居在滬西，日裹旣不能岀門，夜裹更覺得可怕，幸而小樓的窗是面街的，每天兩個人靠在窗橋上看對街的窗飾，馬路中的汽車，電車，人行道上的賣花女。但是後來能够閉了眼把這些對象明淅地想像岀來，於是盼望有一個下雨天來調劑我們的精神痛苦。其實失業的人，似乎已剥奪了生的權利，下雨天對於我們的帮助也是兩個人靠在窗檽上看對街的窗飾，馬路中的汽車，電車，人行道上的賣花女，不過那絲絲的雨點直是太美麗的背景。然而我不能對於這雨天的美妙描寫岀，卽使搜集了許多好聽的字句形容她，也是詞不達意的；而且，我想讀書中不乏同好的人，這雨天的好處正是只有同好的人體騐的。如其他們對於雨天發生惡感的，那我寫岀來也屬徒然。</p>
<p>這幾天又一貫的下起雨來，現在雖比較地是有職業的人了，但是對於雨天仍是執拗的相當愛好。我的辦公所，是一個高大洋房的五層樓，固然我的地位也好，是臨窗的，然而最優勝的是對面没有同樣的高洋房。極目所望，我彷彿已變換了個環境。照我幾年來所實騐的都市，一定没有這樣的崇高，更飄着忽大忽小的雨絲，我好像夢遊到一個不知名的勝地。這樣，我呆住了记卻工作也是常有的事。</p>
<p>幾天來，完全沉醉在雨的美景中，那個休息的禮拜天也傻子似的去呆坐了</p>
<p>二小時。今天也是下雨，我握着鋼筆呆想的時候，忽然感覺到一個不快的念頭，然而說不岀所以然來。總之，雨今天彷彿失去了固有的美的，她不能像往昔一樣打動我的癖好，不過，我愛雨天是不會易轍的。</p>
<p>是我想起了同我觀雨的朋友。當我抓到現在這飯碗後的一個月，他爲家信催歸了。送行的那天，正是這樣的雨天，他帶了一箱破書，我懐了一股熱涙，兩個人分離了。後來他信說，爲了他不願依賴我，所以造假信走的，希望我努力，我們有再見的時候。</p>
<p>這樣，已是二年了，没有他的消息。不知今天他也在觀雨否··他同樣想起懐念他的故人否？</p>
<p>我眞希望明天就是個睛天，不然，那個不快的念頭將要像蛇一樣地纏繞着我的心！</p>
<p>但是，那打在玻璃窗上的是什麽聲響呢？我埋緊頭不敢抬起來。</p>

<p>和他做對頭。）</p>
<p>夜深的路燈，顯得格外的昏黃，天空黑悶悶的，好似一張鉛板緊壓着。幾個野孩子，縮頭縮腦的，愈走愈遠了。</p>
<p>小毛這時却還獨自一個的縮着腦袋，蹲在一條衖口的烟紙店舖廊下，他身上的那件單薄而且破得不堪的夏布衫，都給雨濕得透透的，緊貼着肉。本來秋夜裹已經有點凉了，身上又穿着這件水淋淋的衫，這使小毛身上的孔毛，都一根根的竪起來，愈縮愈冷的在發抖。</p>
<p>幾天來，小毛的運氣可眞是倒霉，北四川路橋上拉車的生意不能做，賣夜報的幾十個銅子本錢，又吃得光光的，弄得報也没法賣了。作天抓進去白白的吃了幾下耳光。今天已一整天的没米下肚了，天又偏偏的下起雨來，總之，小毛這幾天的時運不佳的情形，在他還是第一次碰到的。</p>
<p>他這時满肚子盡是悶氣，但又想不岀一個方法來。</p>
<p>（那不是小毛嗎？）</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>黑越越的從那邊走過幾個人來，一個高聲的呌着，小毛就聽岀是小黑子的聲音，他也就擊了兩下手掌，答應着。</p>
<p>（你這傢伙，找了你好半天，快點，那邊有着一筆生意哩！）</p>
<p>小毛這時眼睜睜地望着地他們幾個，小黑子的話他也没心去聽。</p>
<p>（噲，你們吃些什麽？老子餓得要死。分一點給我吧！）</p>
<p>（哈，原來你是餓慌了，要吃，有的是，怕你小肚子裝不下去。）</p>
<p>小黑子開玩笑的說着，但小毛聽到有東西吃，身也不發抖，跳起來一把將小黑子揪住。</p>
<p>（快說，什麽地方有得吃，老子就去，眞餓得要死了。）</p>
<p>寂靜的路上，小毛和着他們在走動了。看看走到了蓬路轉角，那邊小三就擊兩下掌通知着。</p>
<p>小毛趕緊了幾步，凑近了小三，又是一手的把小三揪住。</p>
<p>（噲，什麽東西可吃，快拿岀來。）</p>
<p>（有的是，生意做上了，還可買套新衣服穿呢。）</p>
<p>（那有這樣好生意，老子去幹，快點說。）</p>
<p>他們一羣五六個，蹲在路角那黑暗的地方，咕嚕的談了大半天，大家都很歡喜似的，在微雨之馬路上，穿竄起來了。</p>
<p>但是據說小毛和他的幾個流浪小朋友就在這個挨餓挨冷的秋雨之夜裹，去過着鐵窗的生活了。他們的罪狀，就是不務正業，屢犯竊案。</p>
<p>自從這一夜起，北四川路一帶，已减少了幾個流浪在街頭的野孩子了。</p>

<p>— 雋</p>
<p>戀懐</p>
<p>秋的踪跡逡巡在遲熟的葡萄珠串上··逡巡在遲放的菊花叢上。菊花碇開紅色的金瓣，菊花碇開紫色的金瓣，躺在微温的陽光裹邊，迎着微温的陽光輕倩的笑着。就在雜色的菊花遮攔的架子旁，嗅着菊花的淡薄的香味，做起白日夢來了。</p>
<p>夢中，深嘗葡萄般甜味的唇的戀味，聽私情曲從清揚的咽喉裹𣼣岀來，𣼣着年輕的琳琳的心秘密，琳琳的心靈的秘密，琳琳眞是一隻呌人可愛而又呌人憂愁的白燕子呵！燕子是隨着季候的變遷而變遷的。</p>
<p>琳琳伸手摘下一朶紅色的葡萄，眯眯地道··</p>
<p>遲開的葡萄是有着遲開密味，戀的象徵呵！</p>
<p>嚼着葡萄的密味和有葡萄的密味的戀的味呵！這些日子我的整個兒的心，我的想思，就全捷息到琳琳的葡萄味的嘴唇上，頭髮上</p>
<p>浸在戀的迷惘中歡愉的而又憂愁着的心。</p>
<p>秋天是落葉的時節，我的戀的花色亦隨着剥腿了燦爛的色了。</p>
<p>燕子是跟着季候的變遷而變遷他的家的。</p>
<p>琳琳果眞成了季候的燕子呀！</p>
<p>燕子似的琳琳，現在飛翔到什麽地方去呢？故家雖還有葡萄的珠串，和菊花的金瓣。却已没了琳琳燕子似的輕巧的影子。在空濛的細雨下故家是讓秋的深厚的寂寞味所籠罩着了。寂寞的故家呵。</p>
<p>可是故家是有過並不寂寞的時候的。</p>
<p>可是琳琳燕子的琳琳已棄了故居去營造她的新居。可是架山下却鐫着昔日踟蹰的足印和戀的足印。</p>
<p>琳琳你有没有回憶往事的時間？你會不會在明年這時候又燕子似的飛了回來？</p>
<p>燕子似的琳琳的一顆心，和五月的季候一般難測量啊！</p>
<p>同着飄起的秋風琳琳倐的飄向南方去了。和一顆心一同地。只掉下我，然而我的整個兒的心，整個兒的靈魂，還仍舊纏繞於琳琳的葡萄味的嘴唇，頭髮上。我想期待琳琳會回到我的身邊，聽她輕揚的咽喉裹𣼣岀私情曲，𣼣岀年輕的琳琳的心的秘密。用更長的日子等着。</p>
<p>但不知琳琳到底回來不回來呢？</p>
<p>也明白華筵終有散塲的時候，逝去的情景不能再追回來，正如墮地的雨珠不能再呌它飛向天上。祇爲了琳琳給我的感動太劇烈了，我的全整個生命起了大大的震撼，怎麽着也平靜不了。</p>
<p>每天，從早到晚，我像失了神，站在窗前望着靑色的天空。等燕子似的琳琳燕子樣從天上飛下來。</p>
<p>用我二十一個的年頭的鬰抑的心。</p>
<p>然而琳琳什麽時候回來？回來不回來？</p>

<p>早上，用臉布蘸着冷水擦了擦朦朧的眼睛，把舊外套一披上，便趕緊把手伸到外衣袋裹去數剩下的銅子··一·二·三·四······不敢多想了，今天得生活在這不到十個銅子的條件下面—</p>
<p>岀門的時候，眼睛是朦朧的，毫不珍惜地记掉了幸福夢，讓知覺給現實的鐵車輾着，像車輾着道路似的。抬起頭，看着工塲頂上的挺直的烟突，電車綫，電車走過時車頂的電桿在綫的關節上磨岀了綠的火星，飛射着，便又消滅了，無聲息地。</p>
<p>（—生活的衝突的火花啊。）</p>
<p>不錯，生活的衝突的火花也是，爆發着，又無聲息地消滅的呢。</p>
<p>着袋裹的　子，又　　地　起來啦，接着全身便起了陣顫憟，一種輕微的空虛的軟綿綿的感覺，經騐像閃電一般地打着理智，是　餓！猛獸一樣的噬着人的飢餓啊！</p>
<p>想着，可笑啦，何必要人家知道呢在這世界中，要頂能知道，可是人是頂不能知道人的。如果說，世界是一個謎吧，可是這個謎，雖然在解答上失了望，至少可以，自已是曾從那種猛獸一般的軟綿綿的感覺中學到一點的。受過餓的人對着食品店的陳列橱中放着的豐盛的食品是一點都不覺得驚奇的。懷着一個空的肚子在外面儘瞧着的時候，人是禁不住會想到的··爲什麽不能拿來吃呢？爲什麽中間隔着一層玻璃呢？這一層玻璃是什麽呢？</p>
<p>（而是一層薄薄的玻璃，是代表着。一種可怕的勢力，人類的自私的。）</p>
<p>世界是穿着一件玻璃的外衣的啊。</p>
<p>而感覺到，這一層玻璃，就是這一層玻璃啊，它是有力的；它底本身便包含了一種不合理，一種矛盾，一種悲劇人類的大悲劇啊</p>
<p>迷惑了··然世界所代表的是什麽呢，不是整個的不合理嗎？</p>
<p>不說挨着餓的人是多少有一點殘酷的，他有抺殺全部的（人）的好意的勇氣；然而這是不很說得過去的，世上儘有一種鐵一般的（無情）的人，他們是把苦難當作萬有文庫，他們什麽都向苦難中去學，他們是用着一種不同的眼光去看世界的。</p>
<p>看着縱横的建築物，看着天上的雲，看着不满十個銅子的全部財產，殘酷地，又冷靜地，茫然了。</p>
<p>感覺是浮熱的，軟綿綿的。</p>

<p>吃晚飯了。旭齋家頗有古風，至少是男女有别；譬如說女人祇好在廚房裹吃飯，而正廳裹却是三兄弟加上一個時敏，剛好四個人各霸一方。</p>
<p>鄕間生活照例是很儉樸的，除了初一十五，桌子上很少有肉的機會。何况正輔公公的家訓很嚴，從來就是省吃省用。今天已經很特别，因爲二叔第一天回家，所以也有一碗煎蛋，已經很豐盛了；這是時敏知道得非常清楚的。</p>
<p>芷齋在吃飯的時候，很少說話。不過這並不是他不想說話，而是他頗有心思在懷··自已没有早兩天寫封信回來，所以他老婆還不知道自已已經回來了，而仍在娘家玩着。少不了這一晚得冷清一個人睡一夜，明天早晨，一定到岳父家去一趟。可是又担心明天下雨，像今晚這樣的暖熱，明天的天氣，恐怕是不大靠得住的。</p>
<p>一會兒，已經吃了一碗半飯了，他一直是悶着没有說一句話，可是不知爲什麽老大和老三爭辯起來了，他一聽之下，原來是老三說黎元洪的人是如何了不起，如何好，而老大却不大看得起黎元洪，理由是他旣然吃了皇家的俸祿，就應當盡忠報國，不應該投革命黨，興兵造反。他旣然不忠於清廷，難道又會忠於民國麽？而孫文，黃興他們，他們却又是一種說法，因爲他們就是不受皇家俸祿而奔走革命的。其人格之偉大，也就在此。後來老大還舉岀證據來，他說··</p>

<p>— 伽瀕</p>
<p>受着時代底潮流的推動，在中國攝製的電影，雖然在形式上還不曾達到表現藝術的極境，但已被認爲是社會大衆的敎育而在電影上大聲疾呼地提倡文化運動的確大有人在了。是的，電影在一國文化底上頭，老是先鋒似地向前邁進。然而，这使命，並不是這許許多多的粗製濫造的電影作品所能担負得起的。中國電影到現在，老實說，還是有不少惡劣與無聊的東西，不但没有内容，就連表現藝術的技巧也没有。講文化，在中國的電影在怕不是一件容易的事吧？可是，終於有人岀來不得不在這上面作文化運動了。</p>
<p>電影，如其眞正是電影的話，我總承認它是時代的先驅，在象徵着現實的人生而去推動文化的演進··在意識上，它並不是社會敎育底工具而是領導社會敎育的，在形式上它在綜合藝術各部門而極力地在表現（力）和（美）。（力）和（美），一方面是電影藝術上所不可或缺的基本條件，另一方面却可以說是人生的形態與行爲上所最需要的實質。譬如我們說，腦子要愈文明，身體則要愈野蠻了。所謂身子要愈野蠻者，便就是以（力）爲其主要成份也。至於（美），（現代美），則又非健康不爲功矣。</p>
<p>爲其如此，我便有所不得不說（電影上的健美運動）。</p>
<p>健美，在這幾年來，的確是一個時髦不過的名詞。但在電影上，璚不曾見到有人提倡這實際工作的健美運動。健美，也許有人一見到這兩字就會想到女人的大腿，其實，其腿，又何嘗有罪惡之可言！特見仁見智各有不同而已。</p>
<p>似乎是許多年前的一般的意見了··（林黛玉式的病態美，已不再適合爲中國女性的（美）的典型··體格的健全，才是現代女性美的標準。因爲照着優生的理論，要有强健的國民才是以挽回頽敗的國勢，則母性的健康便是一件急不容緩的事了，）那時候，事實上，隨着這論調而發生的，在這矛盾的社會裹還有女子們自已戕賊自已身體的種種行爲。束胸的惡習，還没有改除。好在人生的環境是屢次變遷，也許是文化底不斷的推進，這種惡習，不久也就消滅無餘。然而，女性的健康，終究是一種慢程的前進。在現在，也儘多着那些林黛玉式的病態美的女性寄生在社會裹頭。就算，我們有時在舞塲裹面看見那些畸形的曲綫罷，雖然不束胸，但决不是健美的表現。而且，她們距離健美是很遠很遠的。因爲，她們總是弱不禁風地婀娜不過。</p>
<p>幹電影的先生們，我希望你們正確地注到（電影上的健美運動）。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>據說這是幾年前的舊作品，然而一般的說，倒是很可以看看的作品。</p>
<p>不過，嚴格的批判起來，導演因着劇本的規定，他是以舊的手法來抓住觀衆的。關於這方面，我們可以舉岀一點來作事實的說明。</p>
<p>徐琴芳因受辱與父死的傷感，憤而躍崖自殺，賀志剛和鄭君里在後追趕，在山上，在樹林中，在懸崖邊，逼成一個高潮。相當而且適當的剪接，使這一塲戲頗爲緊張。然而這裹的一前一後的　跑的以及剛跳下去的時候恰好被人求住，却不免是很陳舊的了。</p>
<p>又如最後一塲，徐琴芳和賀志剛的定情，徐琴芳固然做得很細膩，而導演對於情調的處理，也是很可取的。不過以徐琴芳不肯吃賀志剛分給她的梨子，以說明她不願分離，以二人纒絨繩象徵她們的情絲，却是比較的不易於使一般人都能理解，而且也不是新頴的方法。</p>
<p>當然，上述種種，大半都是編劇的責任，導演將劇一中所包含的充分的表現岀來，自然是最低限度盡了自已的職責。不過一個成功的導演，他是應當彌縫劇本之缺點的，如當家少爺賀志剛家裹，旣然那末大的屋子，那末大的花園，爲什麽就只有一主一僕的呢？這是劇本的缺點，而導演至少得多添幾個僕從，使這大家庭熱閙起來。否則，這一家庭就是太誇大了的。</p>
<p>的確，劇本是有着許多缺點，也許有人說，這一劇本至少是很曲折離奇的。然而這是十分勉强的，假使没有在西餐館吃飯的時候，在山中的屋内的時候，以及在公園中幾次的巧遇，那末這一個故事簡直就穿揰不過去。（在電影中爲什麽不能使用巧合，乃是用不着在此解釋的。）徐琴芳在姜又佾家裹突然代人掩飾，這一次已經够了，可是第二次在尚冠武家裹還要那樣忍痛受辱，堅不說岀他的秘密來，乃是無論如何說不過的。再說罷，在人物的性格發展上，徐琴芳由守塔的女兒一變而爲摩登少女，也是十分不妥當的。至於說顧肖虎結着大黑領結到落星街去，是何等不合情理？而反說鄭君里穿西裝易爲惡黨所注目··這些地方是應當由導演負責的。</p>
<p>不，我們檢討劇本，並不就此爲止。更主要的我們得指岀，假使說這是偵探影片，那末這故事却没有注重在偵探案科學的破案方面的相反的，假使没有幾次巧遇，便不能使案情剖白，而在其他方面却做了不少工夫。所以與其說是偵探片，毋寗說是普通的所謂愛情影片而已。</p>
<p>至於說到劇的主題，更是糢得很，暴露紳士們的私生活的醜態，不是主題，那末在謀財害人方面麽？那又是何等平凡庸俗啊。像華納岀品的（紐約快車）的偵探片，倒是値得劇作的學習的了。</p>
<p>演員方面，都還可以過去，化裝略差一點。周達民的攝影很可過去，至少鏡頭角度，很見努力。</p>

<p>（香雪海）這張片子，確是與衆不同，另有一番幽靜的趣味。那裹面描寫的並不是都市的罪惡，也不是摩登的戀愛，而是别開生面的純潔的民情，是前一時代的實景，用巧妙的手法，攻擊現實所遺留的餘毒。其取材的奇突，含意的深刻，確是普通所不能想像得到的。</p>
<p>關於取材方面，是以一個鄕村女子的一生爲主題，她經過了許多的艱難困苦，悲歡離合，爲了她深受迷信的荼毒，她深信神是萬能的，把她所有一切的困難，都祈求於神，事有凑巧，迷信得了她的一切，同時亦失了她的一切因爲她在一切如願以償之後，就實行了她的許願，而去做了尼姑。當然，她的内心是非常的隠痛。後來，畢竟是爲了慈母天性的感動，在她兒子历找她而跌傷之後，她仍回到家中，去過苦中樂的生活。</p>
<p>就演員方面來講，没有一個人是不着力的，不僅是主角得力，就是配角亦没有一個是不相稱的，眞的是人人都適合本人的身份和個性，當然這是導演和演員的共同努力，才有此完美的成績。尤其是童星黎鏗，他的表情是如何的動人，更給與觀衆以深刻的印象。</p>
<p>字幕方面，有許多地方是用是特别巧妙而幽默，祇須仔細回味一下，便知其妙處。同時還用象徵並聲的表示，這正可以說是無微不至了。</p>
<p>在第一幕之後，緊接最後一幕，以她在尼菴中的回憶而追叙她一生的經過，這種剪接法是特别的，是中國電影的首創。</p>
<p>本片中的敲本魚和（人生）中的打鐵，我以爲是同一的作用。</p>
<p>（人生）在社會上已有了相當的榮譽此片我可以預料，一定也不會落（人生）之後，也許會在（人生）之前，因爲較（人生）更進步的多！（却酬）</p>

<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>班卓正吩咐着賽克斯怎樣地替他寫新聞，不意斐羅突然不答應起來。他說··（且慢，我是二頭腦。你將我的名字寫在裹面）。班卓怒叱道··（滾岀去！你不用管他。你先寫我好了）。斐羅聽了，將槍拔了岀來，指住了賽克斯道··（你乖乖地把我的名字寫進去）！班卓亦拔岀槍來，咆哮着道··（美國人要曉得斐羅做什麽？渾蛋）斐羅大聲喊道··（誰打死審判長和他的朋友的？就是我）！班卓道··（那算什麽。没有我的命令行嗎）？賽克斯一邊勸解，一邊害怕着將兩個盜魁的槍口，從他的頭上推開。正在這爭吵得難解分時候，一個强盜飛奔似的跑了進來喊道··（班卓！快走！兩旅人已經開到了！快些）！班卓連忙走門口，四面一張，祇見一旅的馬隊，已經開到了鎭上。他手下的人，都已經跳上了馬，將槍亂放着，打在街道兩面的玻璃窗上，然後鞭着馬逃走。班卓掉轉頭來，喊着賽克斯道··（走吧！跟我來）！賽克斯道··（不興，我還要拍電報哩）。班卓道··（不要緊，再找一個電報局好了）。賽克斯還不肯走。可是被班卓一拉，拉到門口，將他輕輕一抱，跨上了馬飛奔而去了。</p>
<p>班卓不過走了一段路，看見路旁有一個照相館，牌子上寫的是（加維多特等照相）幾個字。班卓看見了，就將馬韁一勒，自已跳了下來。斐羅嚇得問他做什麽。他說我要看一個朋友，一個美術家。賽克斯道··（他們都追上來了）。班卓道··（不要緊的）。他就帶了斐羅，湯麥斯和賽克斯一班人，走進了那照相館。加維多是一個身材瘦小的人。　看見了班卓就喊道··（喂，班卓，你現在還有功夫拍照嗎）？班卓道··（我不要拍照。我要你替我寫封信。你認識那個呌露茜姐的女子嗎？我要娶她做我的妇人。你替我寫封信，說我今天晚上去找她）。賽克斯驚異道··（你要結婚了嗎）？斐羅插嘴道··（他最喜歡結婚。他是三天兩天婚的）。班卓道··（我生性如此，近乎宗敎的。加維多，你吿訴露茜妲，我今晚要到她家去，大約十一點鐘吧。呌她預備好了。一切要好些）。加維多開始寫信了。他一邊寫，一邊念道··（我的光榮的皇后······我的小鴿子······）斐羅正站在窗口，看着中央軍隊騎着馬開過去。他掏岀槍來咕嚕着道··（我一下子可以打他三個）。賽克斯連忙喊他不要放。這時加維多的信，差不多已經寫好了，班卓還要呌他信上畫一點好看的東西。加維多道··（亦好。你喜歡畫些什麽？兩隻相吻着的鴿子）？班卓道··（我想鴿子不大好。畫些和我差不多的東西。一條牛）。加維多道··（不興，不興。信上不好畫那東西的。我替你畫一顆心，一支箭穿着吧······）班卓道··（不要。你給我畫牛。你聽我的話）。加維多不肯。班卓抓着他狠命地指着道··（你畫不畫）？加維多喊道··（你打死我好了。我徧不畫牛！我不畫牛）！班卓眞的掏岀槍來了。他咬牙切齒道··（我命令你！你給我畫一條牛）！加維多没有法子，祇可答應了。但是等到畫好了，班卓拿起那張紙來一看，還是兩只互吻着的鴿子。班卓想舉起槍來就開，但是給賽克斯攔住了。這時中央軍隊已將那地方包圍了起來，班卓對着加維多道··（加維多，你和我們一同走。我是最喜歡美術的）。他說着亦照着綁賽克斯的方法，將加維多亦綁了去。（未完）</p>

<p>Explanation to Britain and France Regarding the Upgrading of the Legation to Embassy</p>
<h3 id="e3">Stating That the Two Countries Have No Reason to Be Surprised <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the issue of the Italian Legation in China being upgraded, surprise was expressed in Paris and London. Recently, "Il Giornale d'Italia" commented on this matter, saying that "British and French figures have no reason to be surprised." The reason for this is due to a misunderstanding of the truth. There is indeed an agreement between Britain, France, and Italy that the positions of their respective diplomatic representatives in China will not be changed without prior agreement. However, if another country besides the three upgrades its legation in China to an embassy, ​​then the three countries can freely handle this matter. The Soviet Russian representative in China has already been upgraded to an ambassador, and Soviet Russia is indeed a European country. Moreover, Italy notified Paris and London in advance regarding this decision before it was published in newspapers. (Havas dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman Issues Opinions on Exchanging Ambassadors</p>
<h3 id="e6">Hope to Achieve with Important Countries <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following opinions to reporters on the 3rd. Since the 17th year of the Republic of China, the government has repeatedly inquired with various countries about the exchange of ambassadors with important countries, but it has not been realized due to various relationships. However, our country's hope for this matter has not changed. In the spring of this year, the Italian government, in view of the importance of the relationship between China and Italy, believed that it could be considered and repeatedly contacted Minister Liu Wendao stationed in Italy. Until last month, when Minister Liu returned to China, the matter took a sharp turn for the better and was established with extremely simple procedures in a very short time. This is truly a commendable special move between China and Italy. However, the government still holds the same hope for other important countries. Only because of the timing of the contact, it was established with Italy first, and it was not intended to show any partiality to other countries. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>League of Nations Opium Suppression Committee Pays Attention to the Situation of Poison in Our Country</p>
<h3 id="e8">Increase in Coffee Extract Imports is Suspicious <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Hu Shize, the representative attending the League of Nations Opium Suppression Committee. At this session of the League of Nations Opium Suppression Conference, the American representative reported that China's imports of coffee extract, which in previous years only reached 60 pounds, have increased to 80 tons in recent years. This is recognised as being alarmingly high for the manufacture of red pills and white powder within China. The government is requested to investigate the truth. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has transferred the inquiry to the Opium Suppression Committee for thorough investigation. Because coffee extract itself is not a drug, the extract is the main raw material for manufacturing drugs. The skin of red and white powder must have a layer of bran, which is made from coffee extract. The American representative estimated the situation of drug manufacturing in our country based on the increase in the import of the extract. It is heard that the Opium Suppression Committee has consulted the Ministry of Finance to investigate whether the import figures of the customs are consistent. However, since coffee extract also has other legitimate uses and is not exclusively used to manufacture red pills, after investigating the accurate number of imports, it is planned to estimate the legitimate needs in the future, or the customs will impose restrictions.

<h3 id="e18">Review and Outlook of the Political Turmoil in Spain Heng <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The Republic of Spain has been established for three and a half years. For two and a half years of this time, political power was controlled by the center-left Aznar cabinet. Under this non-left, non-right rule, the forces of the right wing have gradually risen. At the same time, the dissatisfaction of the left wing has also become increasingly apparent. As a result, the Aznar cabinet lost the sympathy of both sides and collapsed. This was in September of last year. In the two months that followed, the cabinet changed hands several times, all resigning because they could not reconcile the contradictions between the left and right wings. In early November, President Zamora was forced to dissolve the parliament and hold new elections. As a result, the right-wing forces in the new parliament increased significantly. The number of seats held by the various left-wing parties was greatly reduced. Spain's turn to the right was a major turning point. Although the formation of the cabinet was still yielded to Lerroux of the center-right Radical Party, the right-wing policy was much more advanced than that of the Aznar cabinet. This made the left wing even more disappointed, which was a natural result. Since the spring, European news has been filled with reports of the instability of the political situation in Spain, the frequent labor unrest, and the frequent riots. Although no major changes have occurred, they have caused the world to be alarmed. This phenomenon is because the power of the various left-wing parties in the parliament has weakened and they can no longer use legal means to contain the actions of the right wing. Therefore, they attempt to threaten the right wing with terrorist tactics. However, as a result, not only is there no effect, but the sympathy of the people is also lost. At the end of April of this year, Lerroux resigned because his opinion on the amnesty of anti-revolutionaries arrested after the revolution differed from that of the president. However, his successor, Sampere, was still a center-right figure, and most of the members of his cabinet were also members of the Lerroux cabinet. Therefore, his right-wing policy was still the same as that of Lerroux. According to European news, the Sampere cabinet resigned quietly because of the Catalan issue, which was criticized by the Catholic Party. It is also heard that President Zamora has invited Lerroux and the Catholic Party to form a new cabinet. If this move can be achieved, then Spain's turn to the right will be further advanced.</p>
<p>The cause of the fall of the Sampere cabinet this time lies in the Catalan issue, which is also a dispute between the issue of autonomy and the issue of centralism, and is also the focus of the dispute between the left and right wings. In the current Spanish parliament, the Sampere cabinet relied on the support of the center-right Radical Party on the one hand, and on the support of the right-wing Catholic Party on the other hand. Both parties opposed the Catalan autonomy movement politically and the land policy of the left wing economically. If these two parties did not provide assistance, then the Sampere cabinet would inevitably fall. However, since the Catalan provincial elections in April, Catalonia has been almost entirely in the hands of the left wing. Therefore, the autonomy movement is like adding oil to the fire, and the flame is getting stronger and stronger. Not only are the instructions of the central government ignored, but they are also clearly resisted. Under these circumstances, once the Sampere cabinet is criticized by the right wing, it has no choice but to resign. In addition, the Catalan left wing's land policy is fundamentally incompatible with the interests of large landowners. According to the claim of "land to the tiller" implemented by the left wing after winning in Catalonia, the law stipulates that after tenants cultivate the land for twelve years, they can take the landlord's land as their own. This is deeply hated by the Popular Action Party, which represents the interests of the landowners, and the Sampere cabinet has no way to solve the problem. Therefore, it was expected that he would not be able to stay in his position.</p>
<p>If Lerroux's cabinet cooperates with the Popular Action Party this time, then its policies will inevitably become more right-leaning. However, how the Catalan issue will be resolved is worth pondering. Although the left wing occupies a minority in the current parliament, Catalonia is firmly in the hands of the left wing. The promulgation and implementation of laws and regulations is only what it wants. If the central government only relies on political means, it will be difficult to make it comply. If so, will the central government controlled by the Action Party resort to military action? This is indeed a question that deserves great attention.</p>

<p>American Construction of Large Airships Views Japan as a Formidable Enemy</p>
<h3 id="e24">Former Air Force Commander Mitchell Suggests Fifty Airships Could Flatten the Three Islands <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Former U.S. Army Air Service Chief Major General Mitchell today suggested to the Federal Aviation Commission that Japan is America's most dangerous enemy. Therefore, the aviation development of the U.S. Army and Navy must keep this point firmly in mind. The Aviation Commission is currently conducting an investigation of Army and Navy aviation. Mitchell suggested immediately building a large fleet of combat airships and refuted the argument that airships are not suitable for war. As for the repeated accidents involving airships, they are due to improper piloting. He believes that with fifty airships, Japan could be attacked and the three islands flattened within two days. If the navy were used, it would take a long time. Japan is "our most dangerous enemy," so the air force policy of the United States should also be shifted accordingly. "When we design and build airplanes, we must aim to build airplanes that can attack Japan, just as British airplanes are used to attack Europe." Mitchell also offered his expertise for government reference. He believes that the airplanes he advocates should have a flying range of six thousand miles and considers the existing bombers of the U.S. Army to be useless because bombers must be able to ascend to over 35,000 feet to hide in the clouds and avoid being spotted by the enemy. Mitchell believes that the Akron airship disaster two years ago was extremely shameful and vehemently criticized the current policy of the Navy Department of transferring the commanders of the Navy and Air Force to each other. He believes that the airship pilots should be experts, and if naval personnel take over, it is tantamount to fighting without training. Mitchell has always advocated that the Air Force should have a dedicated department and said that modern warfare depends entirely on airplanes, so the expansion of the U.S. Air Force should not lag far behind other countries.

<p>U.S. Army Air Corps Converted to Independent Organization</p>
<h3 id="e25">Nine Hundred Airplanes Ready to Mobilize at Any Time <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The War Department announced today that the newly formed air corps of the General Headquarters will establish an independent air force so that it can operate independently from the army. According to the official announcement, 900 airplanes will be able to undertake offensive or defensive missions upon receiving mobilization orders. According to the plan announced today, all army flying corps fighters will be organized into the air force of the General Headquarters, concentrated at army airfields from California to near Virginia. The General Headquarters will be located at Langley Field, which is located across the Potomac River from Washington. The General Headquarters Air Force will report directly to the General Staff, rather than the Army Air Corps. The status of the Army Air Corps has been weakened as a result, and the power of Major General Foulois, the director of the Air Corps, has also been greatly reduced. A congressional investigating committee requested Foulois's dismissal several weeks ago. (National News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Japan Abnormally Agitated</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Former U.S. Army Air Service Deputy Chief Major General Mitchell boasted that fifty airships could destroy Japan in two days, causing abnormal agitation in various quarters. Although the Japanese naval authorities did not formally express their opinions, their views are as follows:</p>
<p>Major General Mitchell's argument is not based on a national defense point of view, but on a threatening and violent statement of offensive operations, believing that if there are fifty airships, Japan can be destroyed in two days, and when designing airplanes, consider the possibility of attacking Japan. Such violent words are extremely imprudent for maintaining peace and yielding. Before the upcoming naval disarmament conference, this kind of statement came from a famous general of air power supremacists, which is deeply regrettable for world peace. (Dentsu dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>Japanese Naval Representative Talks About Mission to England</p>
<h3 id="e27">Preparing to Formally Announce the Abolition of the Treaty and Unilaterally Seek Understanding from Britain and America <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Navy Rear Admiral Yamamoto, on his way to England, revealed this news. Today, he told a news interviewer that the mission of this trip is to announce the abolition of the current naval treaty and to present a new plan for world peace based on reducing offensive armaments. He said that if Britain and America understand Japan's true reasons for abolishing the treaty, any disturbances that may occur in Japan's relations with Britain and America will be extinguished early. Japan firmly believes that the ratios established in the Washington Naval Treaty were based on the military strength of the three signatory countries at the time, not on the self-defense needs of the three countries. This is one of the reasons for Japan's abolition of the treaty. Japan believes that countries should be allowed to have weapons sufficient to guarantee national security, and countries should not have armaments sufficient to endanger other countries. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku, the Japanese government's disarmament representative in Seattle, and his party arrived in Seattle on the morning of the 2nd. An American former news reporter questioned Yamamoto, saying that the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force will hold large-scale exercises in Alaska in 1935. What is Japan's opinion on this? Yamamoto replied that the Japanese are always concerned about the actions of the U.S. Combined Fleet, but this is not nervous. The Combined Fleet's exercise in Alaska is the natural right of the British Navy, and Japan does not want to interfere. (Japanese United News dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>Japanese Army's Interference in Internal Affairs</p>
<h3 id="e30">Issuing a Booklet, All Parties Consider It Rash, The Seiyukai Believes It Is Oppressing Other Institutions <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The government is quite perplexed about the army's booklet issue, and its feelings are as follows: Prime Minister Okada often discusses national defense issues with the Minister of the Army, and their opinions are completely consistent. As for general national policies, if the content of the booklet is the ambition of the entire army, then Minister of the Army Hayashi should have advised the Prime Minister before publishing it, or advocated it in the cabinet meeting. If it is a personal view, it should be discussed separately. Now, it is published as an official document, which is a bit rash. Social policies, economic policies, rural policies, etc., are all decided by the cabinet meeting, and each responsible province is responsible for implementing them. Now, the army directly criticizes them, which is very inappropriate. The Prime Minister will wait for Minister of the Army Hayashi to return to Tokyo to question his beliefs.

(Dentsu dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 3:00 p.m. today, the Seiyukai held a general affairs meeting at its headquarters to discuss the issue of the booklet published by the army. The result was a consensus as follows: (1) Although the booklet expresses the modern meaning of national defense very well, it is difficult to sympathize with the reform of the current economic system, which all returns to the unified state control. (2) If it is an important opinion, it should be consulted with the cabinet meeting first, and then it can be published. This time, it was published independently, which is a bit rash. Does Prime Minister Okada have any sense of responsibility for this? (3) During the budget preparation period, and when preparing to convene a temporary parliament, the army suddenly published a booklet. What is its true intention? In short, the army's interference outside of its jurisdiction and its sense of oppression of other institutions are very regrettable. (Dentsu dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>(London) Today, the National Labour Party Executive Committee meeting has successfully cleared one of the major obstacles in the process, namely the use of a general strike as a weapon against war. Although the Labour Party was opposed by the Socialist League, it is still in harmony with the Trade Union Congress. The general strike issue will be decided by the Trade Union Congress in an emergency. The Labour Party conference unanimously passed a resolution opposing inducing deviation from the bill, therefore depriving the people of the opportunity to oppose the government's war and peace policies. Today, the new executive committee was elected by vote. Sir Cripps was elected as one of the executive members for the first time by a majority of votes, which was very surprising because Cripps is a socialist. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) The Labour Party is meeting in Southport. Today is the second day. The "Socialist League," led by Sir Cripps, is one of the radical factions in the Labour Party. Cripps gave a passionate speech, saying that compromise and hesitation policies led to the bankruptcy of Prime Minister MacDonald's political position, and the Labour Party should abandon this policy in the future. But as a result, the faction led by Cripps eventually failed. At the morning meeting today, Labour Party Secretary Henderson (Chairman of the Disarmament Conference) gave a long speech and proposed a resolution stating, "Our party is deeply satisfied with the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations and believes that this historically valuable event can make the international system for maintaining peace more effective." This proposal was passed. Henderson mentioned the issue of "War and Peace" in his speech, saying that the intention to use a general strike to prevent war has not been abandoned, but it cannot be regarded as a fixed and unchangeable principle. In his view, the Labour Party's policy is to maintain peace by building a system of international cooperation, and only this system is sufficient to prevent war. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>

In his speech, Benn vividly described the slave-like situation of Japanese factories dealing with workers, and strongly stated that Japan is relying on its cheap labor to seize world markets. Benn also discussed Japan's foreign policy, saying that the Japanese have a slogan: "Our country is the Britain of the East," and Japan's cruel territorial expansion policy will undoubtedly make people "recall the Britain of the previous century."</p>
<p>Benn also elaborated on the situation in the Soviet Union, portraying the amazing construction work of the Soviet Union, and especially praised the extensive economic development of Siberia. Benn continued, "The significant difference between the Soviet Union and other countries in the world is that we can see everywhere the great enthusiasm of the Soviet people for their industrial construction." Benn also said that among the countries in the world that are willing to avoid military conflicts, none is more willing than the Soviet Union. After this statement was finished, the audience applauded like thunder. Benn continued, "No one can gamble against the Soviet Union's peace policy, because Soviet workers will be able to fight the invaders to the last drop of blood if they are attacked."

<p>Madrid The Spanish cabinet crisis has passed smoothly today. After consulting with leaders of various parties all day, President Zamora finally commissioned Lerroux, the leader of the extreme faction, to form a cabinet tonight, based on a very broad parliamentary foundation. The extreme faction, the Agrarian Party, and the Catholic Party are all being enlisted. The nature of the new cabinet is clearly anti-Marxist, and unlimited Marxist propaganda in the country, such as inciting labor unrest and creating domestic unrest, will be strictly prohibited in the future. Lerroux is optimistic about the prospects for forming a cabinet after receiving the order. He is confident that he can submit the list of the new cabinet to the President within one day, so that the new cabinet can attend Congress within 24 hours. (National News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e43">Foreign Secretary Chamberlain Indicates No Intention to Participate in International Conference <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Chamberlain stated today that Britain has no intention of participating in any international exchange rate stabilization conference for the time being. Chamberlain spoke at a banking banquet tonight, saying that he would like to reiterate the British government's policy, namely that the government will maintain the independent status of the pound sterling and the Exchange Equalisation Account. The establishment of the Exchange Equalisation Account is to avoid excessive fluctuations in exchange rates. Chamberlain added, "I feel that we are gradually tired of international conferences, because conferences require the smoothest atmosphere, but this kind of atmosphere is not always available, so I think that for the time being, we should first have private discussions." Chamberlain's remarks were probably due to recent news from New York, saying that bankers there believe that Britain will lower the pound sterling and restore it to its old parity with the U.S. dollar. At that time, the exchange rate can be stabilized. (National News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Financial Secretary Chamberlain said today before a group of bankers and merchants in the City of London that the first eight of this year increased by 20 million gold pounds, but the difficulties of international trade seem to be increasing. The price of the pound has weakened slightly recently due to seasonal factors, and it has become more severe due to foreign financial and political incidents. He believes that this cannot be regarded as a scene of the past. The government's current policy is to maintain the independence of the pound sterling and prevent excessive fluctuations. The government has never sought to set the exchange rate at a certain point, or sought to maintain its price within a certain limit, to fight against seasonal and other powerful forces. The connections between the various states inside and outside the empire and the pound sterling have been safely maintained, and it is gradually recognized as a feature of the international monetary system. The Financial Secretary then praised the steps taken to establish central banks within the empire last year, saying that this is enough to promote their common imperial goal of monetary policy. The Financial Secretary then presented statistics to prove the progress of trade and production. Compared with the same quarter of last year, the index in the second quarter of this year has increased as follows:</p>
<p>April to June of this year Same quarter last year</p>
<p>Textiles 91 86</p>
<p>Chemicals 109 101</p>
<p>Machinery and shipbuilding 119 97</p>
<p>Copper and iron 104 78</p>
<p>The Financial Secretary said that the ships currently under construction have doubled compared to before, and the number of ships lying idle has been reduced by half. Retail sales in August increased by 5% compared to the same month last year, which proves that the progress of industry has gradually had a good impact on the purchasing power of the people. The Financial Secretary concluded that the ironclad evidence of the progress of trade is greater than that expressed by the number of unemployed people. Former Financial Secretary Horne is now a giant in the British business community. It is said that he believes that the value of the pound sterling has recently been too high. If we can return it to another price, it can benefit British bankers. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Mr. Fukai, the Governor of the Bank of Japan, told reporters today that the Bank of Japan does not wish to take any action to curb fluctuations in the yen exchange rate. Rumors that the Bank of Japan intends to work with the Ministry of Finance and the Yokohama Specie Bank to manage foreign trade to prevent the yen from continuing to fall are unfounded. The yen is valued against the US dollar in past decades but has switched to being valued against the pound sterling since March of last year. Under the current circumstances, it is best to convert to the pound sterling. There are indeed fluctuations in the price of gold in the foreign gold market and the buying price, but Japan has not yet made any decision on whether to increase the buying price.

A total of thirty-two papers will be presented, and it is said that they all have great value in medicine. The various circumstances of the opening of this conference are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Establishment History　Around 1908 (three years before the founding of the Republic of China), medical experts from various Eastern countries, realizing that world transportation was becoming increasingly convenient and that various diseases had become internationalized, no longer suitable for closed-door research, jointly planned to organize an international medical organization to hold regular meetings for mutual discussion. Thus, the Far Eastern Association of Tropical Medicine was established. Since then, eight conferences have been held, with the dates and locations as follows: First Session, Manila, 1910; Second Session, Hong Kong, 1912; Third Session, Annam, 1913; Fourth Session, Java, 1921; Fifth Session, Singapore, 1923; Sixth Session, Tokyo, Japan, 1925; Seventh Session, India, 1927; Eighth Session, Siam, 1930. The member countries are: 1. Australia, 2. India and its dependencies, 3. China, 4. Federated Malay States, 5. Philippines, 6. Hong Kong, 7. Annam, 8. Japan, 9. Honolulu, 10. Straits Settlements, 11. Dutch East Indies, 12. Siam, 13. United States, 14. Macau. At the Eighth Conference in Siam in 1930, the former Ministry of Health of our country officially notified and invited the next conference to be held in China in 1933. The conference passed the motion, but due to the national crisis, it could not be held as scheduled. After notifying the member countries, it was changed to be held in Beijing from October 1st to 7th this year. This is a general overview of the past history of this conference.</p>
<p>▲ Preparations　The conference period was originally scheduled for October 1st to 7th, but now, because the ships carrying delegates from various countries to Shanghai arrive around the 1st and 2nd, the official opening will be changed to the 3rd, with only registration and other procedures on the 2nd. President Wang Jingwei of the Executive Yuan has been invited to serve as honorary president of the conference, and Vice President Kong Xiangxi and Minister of Interior Huang Shao-hong have been appointed as honorary vice presidents of the conference. Director Liu Jui-heng of the Ministry of Health is the acting president of the conference, and medical celebrities Wu Lien-teh, Niu Hui-sheng, and Chu Min-yi have been appointed as honorary advisors to the conference. The names of the executive committee secretary, vice presidents and secretaries of various districts are as follows: Executive Committee Secretary Jin Bao-shan, North China District, Vice President Fang Qing, Secretary Li Zong-en, Central China District, Vice President Yan Fu-qing, Secretary Zhu Heng-bi, South China District, Vice President Li Shu-fen, Secretary Chen Yi-ping. In addition, (1) a Paper Committee has been established, with Wu Lien-teh and Lin Zong-yang as members, responsible for organizing, arranging, printing papers, etc. (2) A Arrangement Committee has been established, with Zhu Zhang-guang and Guo Cheng-zhi as members, responsible for arranging the conference venue and scientific exhibition, etc. (3) An Reception Committee has been established, with Huang Ren-lin, Qi Shou-nan, and Jiang Li-geng-sheng as members, responsible for all reception matters during the conference. (4) A Transportation Committee has been established, with Shen Ke-fei and Chen Xiang-tao as members, responsible for coordinating the transportation of members to and from the conference. The conference venue is located at the Lichi Society on Huangpu Road, and the group meetings will be held at the Ministry of Health. After the conference, groups will tour Beijing, Hangzhou, and other places, and reception committees will be organized in Beijing and Shanghai to handle reception matters upon the arrival of members from various countries. The accommodations for members in Beijing will be in the newly completed dormitories of the Central Hospital, and those with families will stay in hotels. It is estimated that approximately 270 to 280 delegates and members from various countries will attend. Over 170 papers have been received, all of which are valuable works from experts in various countries. After the conference, they will be compiled into a volume and distributed to relevant medical institutions and organizations at home and abroad. In addition, in order to promote our country's health facilities in recent years, a summary report on the actual situation of central and local health work has been compiled and printed into a booklet for distribution to members from various countries, so as to enhance their understanding of our country's health facilities in recent years and to assist in external promotion.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman Lin's Congratulatory Message "The world evolves, the universe communicates, medicine prospers, and specialization is valued. This conference is the beginning of the Far East, promoting benevolence, with excellent reputation. With broad vision and nurturing, nature creates wonders. All beings with blood and breath share the same physiology. Health, peace, early death, who can fathom the heavens? Human determination surpasses the heavens, and science succeeds. Distinguished scholars, compassionate at heart, humbly discuss, resolving doubts. Deep thought and experimentation, awaken the ignorant. Like a star that illuminates, like the sun at its zenith. Miraculous prescriptions and unique skills, infinitely subtle. With one heart to save the world, with complete impartiality."</p>
<p>▲ President Wang's Speech "Distinguished Delegates and Members, as the honorary president of this conference, I am honored to extend a welcome to the representatives and members from various friendly nations present here today. At the Eighth Conference of your Association in Siam in 1930, the government of our country sent a telegram inviting the Ninth Conference to be held in Nanjing, the capital of our country, which was approved. It was originally scheduled to be held as scheduled in October of last year, but due to the situation in the Far East, it was postponed for one year. Today, representatives and members from India, Hong Kong, Annam, Japan, Macau, the Dutch East Indies, Siam, the Federated Malay States, the Straits Settlements, the Philippines, the United States, and the International Federation have come from afar as scheduled. Scientists from all over the world gather together with a spirit of mutual love to discuss the diseases, sufferings, and medical relief methods of mankind, which is a very important and great undertaking. Our country feels exceptionally honored. Today, most of the countries participating in the meeting are affected by tropical diseases, and they are equally concerned about the prevention and treatment of tropical diseases. The common purpose of the participating countries has united them to seek happiness for mankind. The eastward transmission of Western science has been going on for only over three hundred years in history, while the introduction of modern medicine into our country has only been going on for decades. Since the establishment of the National Government, special attention has been paid to the construction of health undertakings, and efforts have been made to develop and promote them. At present, various central and local health, medical, and epidemic prevention agencies have been established one after another and are actively carrying out their work. The gentlemen present here today are all the backbone of the medical and health administration circles in the Far East. We all know that this is the first time that your association has held a meeting in our country. This will be permanently recorded in the history of science and in the history of our country. I sincerely hope that while exchanging research experiences, you will visit the medical and health construction in various parts of our country. Our country welcomes you very much, and at the same time hopes to obtain your valuable advice. I now extend my sincere welcome and declare the official opening of this conference, and on behalf of the government and people of our country, I wish your association great and glorious success."</p>
<p>▲ Minister Huang's Speech "Distinguished Delegates and Members, today is the official opening of the Ninth Conference of your Association. As the honorary vice president of the conference, I am deeply honored to extend my welcome to all of you. The gentlemen present here today are all medical and health experts from various Far Eastern countries. Their usual duties are extremely heavy. This time, they have been able to sacrifice their precious time and travel from thousands of miles away to attend the meeting. This kind of enthusiasm and perseverance can be said to be a spirit of promoting science and a spirit of benevolence and saving the world, which is very admirable. At the same time, in my position as Minister of Interior, I would like to express some opinions on the scope of internal affairs. There are many things included in the scope of internal affairs, but medical and health administration is a very important facility, especially during the construction period. No matter what kind of construction, such as water conservancy, land, rural areas, industry, and transportation, it is closely related to health. It can be said that when various constructions begin, health construction must also be carried out at the same time. Since the establishment of the National Government of our country, great attention has been paid to medical and health construction. First, a Health Department was established in the Ministry of Interior, then a Ministry of Health was established, and then it was changed to a Health Department. Recently, in order to promote health technology and adopt the facilities of emerging countries, a Health Experiment Office was established under the National Economic Commission, so that both administrative and technical parties can plan for development and advance in separate ways. Affiliated agencies are also increasing year by year. In various localities, there are also various health experiment zones in cities, counties, and rural areas. The National Government, in order to further promote the progress of medical and health affairs and international cooperation in the academic community, invited your association to hold the Ninth Conference in the capital of our country four years ago. It is being held at a time when our country is actively engaged in construction, and its benefits are extensive. The medical and health profession has a direct relationship with the lives of the people, so its responsibility is very heavy. Moreover, as world transportation becomes increasingly advanced, the spread of diseases is also becoming easier. The health facilities of one country can affect other countries, so international medical and health cooperation is a very necessary undertaking. The progress and discoveries in the various specialized knowledge discussed by the gentlemen present here today will have an impact on the whole world. I am deeply convinced that scholars and people from all over the world are paying close attention, looking forward to it, and welcoming it. Finally, I sincerely welcome the great success of the conference."</p>
<p>▲ Liu Jui-heng's Opening Address Dr. Liu Jui-heng, Director of the Ministry of Health of China and Chairman of the Conference, said in his opening address, "Today, with the progress of culture, medical and pharmaceutical science is also gradually improving. Therefore, today's medical and pharmaceutical undertakings are very different from those of a hundred or fifty years ago. The most important difference is the application and implementation of new sciences such as preventive medicine, personal hygiene, and public health. If we only use modern treatment methods to treat diseases, medical and pharmaceutical science will certainly not have the progress it has today. A large part of today's medical and pharmaceutical undertakings is indeed aimed at treatment, and it may be like this in the next few years. However, with the progress of culture, methods for preventing diseases are being gradually discovered, making various diseases increasingly preventable, or even making many diseases disappear completely. Looking around, the progress of medical and pharmaceutical undertakings in various countries is not consistent, and even within one country, the progress of facilities in various places is not the same, which is regrettable. Because most places do not have sufficient health protection and various medical and pharmaceutical facilities, and even some areas lack modern doctors and hospitals. This is the case in most Far Eastern countries. Therefore, diseases that can be completely prevented are still prevalent. If all countries can make use of modern knowledge of disease prevention, environmental hygiene, and public health, then the following diseases, such as cholera, smallpox, typhus, typhoid fever, bubonic plague, and leprosy, should be completely eliminated from the ground. The reason why these diseases still exist is that although governments are willing to do their best to protect the people, they have not seen results due to insufficient equipment. If they want to provide the necessary protection, the government should first have sufficient specialized personnel, agencies, and funds. This specialized personnel includes doctors, nurses, pharmacists, dentists, midwives, sanitary engineers, health inspectors, and publicity personnel. The agencies include hospitals, especially isolation hospitals, maternity hospitals, sanatoriums, clinical laboratories, seaport quarantine stations, health centers, and rural health clinics and pharmacies to meet the needs. However, it is not easy to achieve these facilities in a short period of time. All of you present here know that we have a very heavy responsibility. We must raise funds for the construction of agencies and the training of personnel. If we have completed the above three points to a considerable extent, then we can talk about public health undertakings. In my capacity as Director of the Ministry of Health and Director of the Health Experiment Office of the Republic of China, I would like to briefly report to you on the health facilities and work in our country in recent years. I must admit that the various works of prevention and treatment of diseases that our country is currently implementing are still far from the standard. We can be proud of the famous internal and surgical physicians we had thousands of years ago, but since medicine has progressed from the philosophical period to the scientific period, our progress has been very slow. Previous Chinese governments neglected to make full use of modern inventions and discoveries in science, and modern medicine and public health undertakings were rarely implemented in the country. Other scientific products, such as railways, automobiles, radios, and various new-style machines, were imported into China relatively late, and medical science was no exception. Since the overthrow of the former Qing government, various political changes have occurred in the country. Until recently, there was no overall plan for construction in the country. Even now, various progress has not been as we hoped. Many people have asked me why this conference was not held in Shanghai or Beijing. Shanghai is very convenient for hotels, transportation, and other facilities. Beijing has the highest institutions of learning and famous scenic spots such as the Forbidden City, which is also very suitable. However, the government finally chose Nanjing, with the intention of allowing the delegates to observe the new construction undertakings of the Chinese government. Just in terms of health agencies, when the former government was in Beijing, there were only two central epidemic prevention offices, the Northeast Epidemic Prevention Office. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing in 1927, the central health agencies established successively are as follows: Ministry of Health of the Ministry of Interior, Health Experiment Office of the National Economic Commission, National Seaport Quarantine Office, Central Health Testing Institute, Beiping First Midwifery School, Central Hospital, Central Midwifery School, Central Nursing School. At a time when the world is in turmoil, the National Government has been able to create various facilities to meet the needs. In the agenda of this conference, we have arranged for you to visit various agencies. Please pay special attention to the Health Experiment Office and the work of its nine departments. The details have been introduced in the "First Report of the Central Health Experiment Office" and "Image Album of the General Situation of Central Health Facilities" that have been distributed to you. The content is very clear. This place is the center of health experiments and future national health implementation work in China. When the Health Experiment Office was established, it sought various technical opinions from the Health Group of the League of Nations to ensure that its work was in line with the latest standards in various regions. In this short period of three years, there has been considerable progress in the above-mentioned aspects. The most rapid progress has been in the management and prevention of infectious diseases, health education, school health, maternal and child health, medical relief facilities, and the establishment of rural health centers. The most fundamental to the country should be the various training classes held, which have trained various specialized and technical personnel, no less than a public health specialist college, so that health administrators and personnel engaged in bacteriology, parasitology, school health, etc. have the opportunity to study and improve their skills. In addition to the various health agencies established by the central government, there are also considerable new measures for medical and health work in various provinces and major cities. Health agencies such as health experiment offices, health centers, midwifery schools, hospitals, and clinics have been established in various places one after another, and are progressing rapidly. We often encounter difficulties in the above-mentioned works. The vast land, the large population, the old customs and various superstitions of the people, and economic difficulties are all major reasons for hindering the progress of medical construction. However, we have been pioneers in this work. There are now twenty-four medical schools in the country, more than six thousand registered doctors, and hundreds of public and private hospitals, which are powerful forces for protecting the health of the people. We should be optimistic about the future construction. Now, let me say a few more words about this conference. This conference has a history of twenty-six years. In Article 2 of the Association's Constitution and the purpose of the conference, "to make medical personnel in the Far East a close group," and Article 4, "to promote friendship among scientific personnel internationally," the main points of this conference are still the same meaning as the above two points. In fact, our difficulties are the same. The deeper our mutual relationship, the greater our harmony. Furthermore, in the past few months, China has sent several hospital teachers to Little Luzon, Annam, India, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies to study bovine plague, kala-azar, malaria, etc. They reported after returning to China that they were warmly welcomed in every country they visited and gained many benefits in knowledge. From this, we can see that the relationship between each other is extremely close. The League of Nations and the Rockefeller Foundation Committee have made great contributions to promoting friendship by sending health personnel from various countries to investigate and study. Now is the time when medical personnel in the Far East should be united. I still remember when cholera was epidemic in Shanghai in 1930, after I convened the first cholera prevention meeting, the health leaders of the three public agencies in Shanghai, the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the Shanghai Municipality, cooperated with each other, and I was fortunate to see it. The work of the Oriental Affairs Bureau of the International Federation in contacting seaport quarantine in various countries is also sufficient to show the spirit of international cooperation. I would now like to further suggest to this conference that the work of this conference should pay special attention to international cooperation. Finally, I thank you for electing me as the chairman of this conference and formally express my gratitude for being the host of the Ninth Conference. The conference has just begun, and I firmly believe that in addition to fully achieving the purpose of the conference, it will also enable the Far Eastern countries, especially China, to obtain permanent benefits in terms of medical progress."</p>

<p>He Yingqin's Tour of Chahar and Suiyuan</p>
<h3 id="e95">Inspecting Mongolian Customs and Traditions; Stability in the Provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) Since assuming his post in Beiping, Chairman He Yingqin of the Beiping Military Branch has remained in the city for over a year. Aside from a brief trip to Tianjin last winter to visit old friends, he had not left Beiping. Recently, with the clear skies and pleasant weather, and the scenic beauty beyond the Great Wall beckoning, he departed Beiping by special train at 7:00 AM on the 26th of last month for a tour of Chahar and Suiyuan. The public, not knowing the true nature of the trip, engaged in much speculation. Mr. He returned to Beiping at 6:30 PM this afternoon (2nd) and gave a press conference, detailing his travels. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Traveling Companions) Those who accompanied Mr. He on this trip included: He Jingwu, member of the Military Branch; Wang Lun, Director; Xie Zhongyuan, Xu Xilin, and Zhang Guanting, Chiefs of Sections; Wang Shanten, Senior Staff Officer; He Chaozhong, Counselor; Lin Qizhi, Secretary; Zhou Yingfang, Aide-de-Camp; and a squad of guards. Shen Chang, Director of the Ping Sui Railway Bureau, also traveled along to ensure smooth arrangements en route.</p>
<p>(Itinerary) Mr. He departed at 7:00 AM on the 26th of last month and arrived in Zhangjiakou at 3:00 PM that afternoon. In addition to attending a banquet hosted by the entire Chahar Provincial Government and attending a welcome reception by various sectors, he spent the night in his special train. On the morning of the 27th, he was guided by Qin Dechun, Director of the Chahar Civil Affairs Department, to inspect the Zhangbei area. He returned to Zhangjiakou that evening and continued his journey by train. On the 28th, he toured the Yungang Grottoes in Datong and spent the night in Zhuozishan. He arrived in Suiyuan at around 7:00 AM on the 29th. Zhao Chengzhou, commander of the Jin Army cavalry stationed in Datong, accompanied him. After arriving in Suiyuan, he visited temples such as the Sheritu Zhao, Wu Pei Temple Zhao, and Chongfu Temple Zhao. He attended a luncheon hosted by Chairman Fu Zuoyi. At 2:00 PM, he reviewed the troops, and at 4:00 PM, he was accompanied by Fu Zuoyi to Baotou. Yesterday (1st), he visited the Kundulun Zhao, accompanied by Fu Zuoyi, Zhao Chengzhou, and Wang Jingguo, commander of the 10th Division stationed in Baotou. He returned to Baotou that day and took the original special train eastward. At 10:30 PM, he passed through Beiping and transferred to the Ping Han Line to Xiling. He arrived at 10:00 AM this morning (2nd), toured for several hours, and returned to Beiping by the original train, disembarking at the West Station at 6:30 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>(Rumors Quelled) When Chairman He Yingqin's special train passed through Beiping last night (1st), it only made a brief stop at Guang'anmen Station. Acting Chairman Shang Zhen, Member Wan Fulin, and senior officials of the Military Branch were already waiting at the station to greet him. Security was tight around the station. After Mr. He briefly spoke with Shang Zhen, Wan Fulin, and others in the train, the train departed. At that time, those with oversensitive nerves speculated wildly. With Mr. He's return to Beiping this evening (2nd), all rumors have been dispelled, and the public feels greatly relieved.</p>
<p>(Mr. He's Remarks) After arriving in Beiping this evening (2nd), Mr. He made the following remarks to reporters: "I was appointed to oversee military affairs in Beiping for a year and seven months. During this time, I have not left Beiping once, except for a three-day trip to Tianjin to visit friends. Recently, with the overall situation stable and official duties somewhat lighter, I took the opportunity to travel to Chahar and Suiyuan for a week, reaching Zhangbei in the north and Baotou in the west. I also went from Baotou to the Kundulun Zhao Lama Temple to observe the Mongolian customs and traditions. This trip was purely recreational in nature and had no particular significance. However, due to the convenience of travel, I was able to meet with military and political leaders and local figures along the Ping Sui Railway, and I was deeply impressed by what I saw and heard. My first good impression was that under the governance of Chairmen Song and Fu, the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan are stable and progressing in construction, showing a vigorous upward trend. Chahar, after the turmoil of several incidents last year, has, in less than a year, eliminated all marauding soldiers and bandits. The towns are clean, and the roads are wide and solid. In the past year, the population of Zhangjiakou has increased from over 60,000 to 90,000, and the population of Zhangbei County has increased from 3,000 to over 10,000. If this continues, the future prospects are bright. Chairman Fu Zuoyi of Suiyuan governs the army and people with a practical and responsible approach. Major policies such as digging canals, promoting land reclamation and animal husbandry, and improving sheep breeds have been deeply rooted, which is truly admirable. Today, those who discuss national affairs and policies all advocate for the development of the Northwest. The Northwest is vast and sparsely populated. There are not enough people to fully utilize its resources. For example, Suiyuan has an area of 1.2 million square li, but a population of only 2.5 million, with only two people per square li, which is a stark contrast to the densely populated provinces in the interior. In the future, immigration to populate the border regions is a fundamental solution, both for resolving livelihood issues and strengthening national power. Furthermore, the reason why the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan have been able to move towards construction is primarily due to the blessing of peace and secondly, due to the ethical efforts of the responsible authorities. Peace is the prerequisite for construction, and ethical effort is the foundation of construction. Only with peace can we devote ourselves to construction, and only with ethical effort can we be clean and efficient, and can we rationalize construction. Extending this from Chahar and Suiyuan to the entire North China region, from a military perspective alone, I was appointed during a time of crisis and have勉维 the status quo. There is nothing to speak of in terms of achievements. The most important thing today is to revitalize the spirit of the people, promote traditional morality, maintain credibility and harmony externally within a reasonable scope, and have the awareness of self-reliance and self-help internally. With this great awareness, we can truly transform North China. This requires the guidance of the central government, the cooperation of local political and military authorities, and the unity of the people's organizations. With concerted efforts, we must work hard. This is not a task that can be accomplished by one person or in a short period of time. We can only redouble our reflection and effort." (2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Yangtze River National Products Tour (Continued) Heng. <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu is an important port along the Yangtze River, with a population of 180,000. Since opening to trade, its commerce has gradually developed, becoming a major rice market in Anhui Province. The commercial situation was very prosperous before the 20th year of the Republic (1931). However, the great flood of that year caused the streets to be several feet deep in water, which persisted for a long time, leading to a significant decline in the market that has not yet recovered. The city has six banks, ten money shops, twelve large silk and cloth stores, five large hardware stores, and twenty-five large rice shops. There is one yarn factory, Yuzhong, two soap factories, five machine factories, and the Mingda Electric Light Company. There are four middle schools for boys, two middle schools for girls, and two vocational schools. Foreign firms include Jardine Matheson, Swire, Nisshin, Asiatic Petroleum, Socony, and Texaco. In terms of finance, bank deposits have increased, while money shops have declined. Few stores have strong financial backing, and it is difficult to maintain business in the current economic downturn. In addition to daily steamboat services on the Yangtze River, Wuhu has the Jing-Wu Road and the Wu-Tun Road, which is a major artery in southern Anhui. The southern section of the Zha-Wu Railway has been opened to Xuancheng, and the northern section is planned to connect with the Jing-Hu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway, which will further develop business. It is generally observed that the Wuhu market is built on the rice market. It produces 12 million shi of rice annually. In the future, if a railway is built in northern Anhui, connecting Huaiyuan to Yuxi on the opposite bank of Wuhu, where it would connect with the Zha-Wu Road, the Wuhu market will have even greater prospects.</p>
<p>To understand the industrial and commercial situation of Wuhu, one can find some information from the Customs Report. The following are the import and export statistics for Wuhu in the 20th year of the Republic (1931) (due to lack of recent Customs Reports):</p>
<p>Value of Imported Foreign Goods (Customs Taels)</p>
<p>Foreign Cloths: 1,944,673</p>
<p>Woolens: 73,701</p>
<p>Electrical Materials: 88,798</p>
<p>Coal: 76,560</p>
<p>Paper: 152,841</p>
<p>Dyes: 237,977</p>
<p>Cigarettes: 504,185</p>
<p>Sugar: 1,577,396</p>
<p>Wheat: 32,890</p>
<p>Hardware: 405,702</p>
<p>Other: 4,190,075</p>
<p>Total: 9,303,798</p>
<p>Value of Exported Local Goods (to Overseas and Domestic Ports)</p>
<p>Rice: 19,409,976</p>
<p>Grains: 26,557</p>
<p>Tea: 0,709</p>
<p>Peanuts: 36,120</p>
<p>Flour: 84,967</p>
<p>Cotton: 358,050</p>
<p>Wheat: 16,083</p>
<p>Beans: 56,185</p>
<p>Fresh Products: 1,544,731</p>
<p>Other: 791,216</p>
<p>Total: 22,336,594</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that Wuhu is centered on agricultural products, and imported goods are mainly clothing materials, which is worthy of our attention. Comparing exports and imports, there is a surplus of over 13 million taels, which is naturally offset by domestic goods. Overland transportation is not included. Local administrations are striving to propose and build roads. If roads are built in all directions, Wuhu City will be the central hub for the transport of agricultural products from the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>(Jiading)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Jiading, Taicang, Baoshan Telephone Service <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Jiading, Taicang, and Baoshan counties are adjacent to each other. For the purpose of liaison and defense, the county governments of the three counties have already connected telephone lines, but they were limited to official use. From October 1st, private users will also be able to make calls. Regardless of whether the call is to Taicang or Baoshan, the charge is one dime per call. However, users must first deposit a registration fee of five yuan at the telephone bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Registration Status of Opium Smokers in This County <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The registration of opium smokers in this county has been extended repeatedly, and will end on September 30th, without any further extensions. The Anti-Opium Committee has issued instructions to all districts and announcements to all sectors of society. The County Anti-Opium Committee dispatched personnel to various districts to issue licenses. These included Wang Bangzhen in the first district (urban area), Feng Keren in the second district (Sijing), Zheng Xiuzhi in the third district (Xinzhuang), Zha Zizhi in the fourth district (Tianmashan), Lu Zimo in the fifth district (Fengjing), Wu Guangbiao in the sixth district (Yexie), Wang Jicai in the seventh district (Tinglin), and Li Wenxue in the eighth district (Shanyang). They departed on the 25th and ended on the 30th. The districts are currently compiling the results, which have not yet been verified. Currently, the first district (urban area) has issued 324 Class A licenses and 970 Class B licenses, which is significantly different from the original reported registration. This is likely due to a lack of understanding in the rural areas and a wait-and-see attitude. It is reported that some people are planning to request the County Anti-Opium Committee to allow a ten-day extension, citing the example of Jiangning County. It is said that if there are only over 1,200 opium smokers in the urban area, which is less than 40-50% of the actual number, then an extension is essential.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Surveying the Disaster Situation in the Entire County <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Due to the drought this year, the harvests in the rural areas of Wu County have been greatly reduced. According to the reports of crop failure from farmers in various villages, the yield is estimated to be just over 50%. Landowners have now organized a Disaster Survey Committee and have scheduled for tomorrow (5th) to dispatch a large number of surveyors, divided into thirteen groups, to conduct on-site surveys in various villages. The total survey expenses are estimated to be over 11,000 yuan. The county government has approved an allocation of 1,700 yuan in silver from local funds, with the remainder to be borne by the landowners. The committee has also requested the county government to allocate an additional 3,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Businesses Refuse to Pay Security Expenses <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The security expenses for the Wu County Security Corps have been collected under the house tax. Since the Security Corps was reorganized into the Security Brigade last month and placed under the command of the Provincial Security Office, the business community has requested the county government to cancel the collection of security expenses to reduce the burden on merchants. The county government did not approve this request. Recently, when personnel from the local tax collection office went to collect the taxes, businesses refused to pay. The County Magistrate of Wu believes that this matter has greatly affected the regular tax revenue and issued an order yesterday (3rd) to the County Chamber of Commerce, instructing all businesses to pay in full to maintain tax revenue.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Improvement Fees to be Collected for Spring Cocoons Sold in Autumn <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The silkworm and jujube model area in this county is implementing a cocoon bank system in the province, and improvement fees are being collected for dried cocoons. However, there is no standard for the collection of fees for spring cocoons sold in autumn. Therefore, a request was submitted to the province for instructions. Yesterday, instructions were received stating that the improvement fees for spring cocoons sold in autumn should also be collected at the autumn rate of six yuan per dan. As for the scarcity of cocoon banks open for business during this season, which is insufficient to purchase fresh cocoons, a joint office for the cooperative production and sales of the sericulture industry should be established to handle the cooperative production and sales of dried cocoons to provide relief.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Yixing Drought Relief Group Comes to Wuxi <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Yixing is located between the three major watersheds of the Tao Lake, Ge Lake, and Tai Lake, and is known as a water town. Therefore, it has historically suffered from frequent floods. This year, however, it has been plagued by a severe drought with no rain. Initially, efforts were made to bail water, but eventually the rivers and canals dried up, making it impossible to save the crops. Eight hundred thousand mu of farmland in the county have been affected, accounting for about eight-tenths of the county's total farmland. All crops have been lost. The severity of the disaster is no less than that of Liyang. Recently, the county organized a Drought Relief Committee and appointed Yang Chu, Zhu Zhongjing, and Yu Xunlu as representatives to come to Wuxi yesterday to contact the Chamber of Commerce and the Red Swastika Society to discuss relief efforts. Lu Bohong, a philanthropist from Shanghai, also came to Wuxi yesterday to meet with Cai Jiansan, president of the Wuxi Red Swastika Society, to inspect the disaster situation in Yixing and Liyang counties and prepare to raise funds for disaster relief.</p>

<p>This county experienced a severe drought for two months this summer, causing a disaster. The rice in various villages had a glimmer of hope due to the efforts to bail water. However, just as the early rice harvest was about to begin, continuous rain suddenly fell, preventing the harvest. If the rain continues, the rice stalks will inevitably rot, greatly reducing the harvest. Farmers, who were waiting for the new rice to cook, are suffering greatly from this delay.</p>

<p>Chen Xikun, a villager from Hanshu Village in the fourth district of Wu County, was murdered while guarding his rice field. The Anjiasha Police Station arrested a suspect, Chen Xipang, because he had a lot of blood on his head and other parts of his body. After questioning, the suspect confessed that the main culprits were Jiang Rongxing, Gao Jinyu, and others. The police station immediately dispatched officers to arrest Jiang Rongxing. Gao Jinyu escaped, and his brother, Gao Erbao, was brought to the station. The other suspects have all fled. Guan Junjie, a prosecutor from the County Court, went to the village on the morning of the 2nd to conduct an autopsy. The autopsy revealed multiple knife wounds on the head and chest, confirming that the victim had been repeatedly stabbed to death while alive. After the autopsy, the culprits Chen Loupang and Jiang Rongxing, as well as the suspect Gao Erbao, were brought from the Anjiasha Police Station to the city to be interrogated according to the law. The motive for the murder was the failure to borrow a water buffalo.</p>

<p>On September 11th, guards on the Zhencheng Road (Zhenjiang-Chengdu) Chengwu section, soldiers from the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the Provincial Security Corps, clashed with road workers, shooting and injuring several workers, killing one worker, Zhao Zhengcai. After County Magistrate Bao reported this incident to the provincial government, Wan Xicui Fang from Wujin also requested the Provincial Security Office to investigate. Director Xiang ordered the County Magistrate of Wujin to respond and, together with the Civil Affairs and Construction Departments, ordered the commander of the 3rd Regiment of the Security Corps to strictly investigate the soldiers who caused the trouble.</p>

<p>The Xicheng (Wuxi-Jiangyin) long-distance bus hit and injured a villager, Zhao Aqi, near the Qingyang station the other day and was sent to Jiangyin Hospital for treatment. The villagers believed that the car accident involved human life and gathered hundreds of farmers on the morning of the 1st to lie on the road, preventing the long-distance bus from passing. The Qingyang branch station reported to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Patrol Officer Yang Qu went to persuade them for a long time, but to no avail. At that time, many cars were blocked. Liu, Director of the Telephone Bureau, sent Zhang Patrol Officer and police to persuade them earnestly. The farmers gradually dispersed.</p>

<p>The Jinghai warship of this county has not been repaired for a long time, the paint has peeled off, and the equipment is decayed and rusted. After submitting a request to the county government and approving a budget of 1,000 yuan, it sailed to Shanghai the other day to enter the factory for repairs. All the soldiers, led by Cannon Chief Zhou Youqi, rented civilian houses in Qinglonggang for temporary residence. The ship's repair time is expected to be about one month.</p>

<p>The Zhenjiang County Anti-Opium Committee stated that the registration of opium smokers ended on September 30th. Although the total number of registrations has not yet been fully reported, it is inevitable that some people will attempt to conceal opium and avoid court appearances. In order to strictly enforce the anti-opium policy, in addition to ordering the subordinate investigators to conduct thorough investigations, the Provincial Public Security Bureau was specifically requested to conduct a detailed investigation and strictly arrest those who conceal opium in the urban area. Regarding the rural areas, a conference of district chiefs was convened to discuss methods and conduct thorough investigations in the countryside in order to emphasize the anti-opium policy and avoid concealment.</p>

In order to arouse public interest, the association sent a commissioner to Jiangdu to order exquisite fireworks, which are scheduled to be set off at the Provincial Public Stadium on the evening of Double Ten Festival (October 10th). During the exhibition period, films will be screened at the Provincial Zhenjiang Public Education Center.

Fortunately, the Canal Works Bureau had made thorough preparations in advance along the canal banks, and there was no impact. However, continuous rain has been falling since the 2nd, and the weather has suddenly turned cold like that of the Double Ninth Festival. If it does not clear up, the canal water will continue to rise.</p>

<p>Pujing Lama Anqin Khutuktu arrived in Shanghai at 2:30 PM yesterday by the Beijing-Zhabei express train from Beijing and is staying at the Winsome Hotel. According to him, this trip to Tibet is to arrange for the return of the Panchen Lama to Tibet and has no other mission. He has decided to take the Italian ship Conte Verde to Hong Kong on the 9th, transfer to India, and enter Tibet. Buddhist groups in the city plan to request him to preach for three days. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival Situation Those who went to the North Station to welcome him yesterday included Wang Zhinan, representative of Yang Hu, Director of the Municipal Security Bureau; Li Jingyu, Director of the Panchen Lama's Shanghai Office; representatives of Buddhist groups such as the Chinese Buddhist Association, the Buddhist Pure Land Society, and the Esoteric Buddhist Abode; Master Bao; and lay Buddhists Zhao Yiwu and Qu Wenliu.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Anqin Living Buddha (Photo by Qichang) <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>More than 20 people were present. The Security Bureau also sent two squads of soldiers to maintain strict guard around the station and on the platform. After Anqin Lama got off the train and took a photo, he immediately took a car to the Winsome Hotel on Route Lafayette to rest. The people who came with him included Secretary-General Wang Luojie, the chanting Khenpo, and 32 attendants. The Lama is staying in Room 5 on the second floor of the hotel, while the attendants are staying in separate rooms.</p>
<p>Statement Upon arriving at his residence, the Lama spoke with Master Bao and representatives of Buddhist groups. The Lama was wearing a yellow robe and a melon-style hat with a red topknot, and deep yellow monk shoes. Although his hair was graying, he was energetic and amiable. When meeting with reporters, he stated through a translator that this trip to Tibet was entirely to arrange for the return of the Panchen Lama to Tibet, as the Lama is scheduled to depart next spring. He himself plans to leave Shanghai on the 9th of this month on the Italian postal company's Conte Verde, arrive in Hong Kong, transfer to another ship, and enter Tibet via Calcutta, India. He does not intend to delay in India. After arriving in Tibet, he will meet with Huang, the special envoy (Mu Song), but the central government has not given him any documents to convey. Once arrangements are made in Tibet, he plans to return to Nanjing as soon as possible. Those accompanying him to Tibet include Secretary-General Wang Luojie, the chanting Khenpo, and 30 attendants. He will do his best to promote the central government's goodwill during this trip to Tibet.</p>
<p>Request to Preach Local Buddhist groups, such as the Buddhist Pure Land Society, believe that the Lama's transit through Shanghai on this trip to Tibet is a rare opportunity and have initiated a public invitation to the Lama to preach at the Jueyuan Temple on Hart Road for three days. They also plan to hold a banquet to welcome him at that time. Representatives were sent yesterday to request him in person. It is said that the Lama has agreed, but the date of commencement has not yet been determined.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Old Kiln Permanent Wharf Completed, China Merchants Hai Rui to Dock Today <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The old kiln wharf in Lianyungang will be fully completed in the spring of next year. A portion has already been completed and named "Permanent". Merchant ships will begin docking today. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Newly Built Wharf In the past, ships traveling to the old kiln unloaded passengers and cargo at Sunjia Mountain, using barges, which was costly and time-consuming. The new wharf in Lianyungang, extending into the sea along the breakwater, is nearing completion. It can accommodate three ships at the same time when fully completed. The completed portion can accommodate one ship for now. The Longhai Railway has notified the China Merchants Bureau that the Hai Rui ship, arriving at the kiln today (the 4th), will begin docking at the "Permanent" wharf for loading and unloading. The Railway Bureau and the China Merchants Bureau's Haizhou branch have specially invited local customers to visit the new wharf today and provide refreshments.</p>
<p>Saving Time The waves in Liantan Port are extremely large, and the work of cargo ships is often delayed by the waves, sometimes taking three or four days to load a single cargo, resulting in huge losses. After the completion of the new Permanent wharf, the waves will be blocked by the breakwater. When fully completed next spring, three ships can dock at the same time, and they can be unloaded as soon as they arrive, without hindrance, reducing the time for ships to stop, which is of great importance to shipping operations.</p>
<p>Seeking to Seize Work There are more than 100 local laborers who are seeking to seize loading and unloading work. In November of last year, there was a conflict. The Longhai Railway dispatched more than 100 armed road protection police to suppress it.</p>
<p>The loading and unloading work was then taken over by the railway police. Now that a portion of the wharf has been completed and ships can dock, the laborers in Haizhou, for the sake of their livelihood, are seeking to seize the loading and unloading work, and the situation is very tense.</p>
<p>Water and Land Precautions After the news spread, the Longhai Railway authorities, fearing a disturbance when the ship docks at the wharf today, have transferred 150 armed police from the road protection team from Zhengzhou to the Permanent New Wharf to be on guard. When the China Merchants Bureau's Hai Rui ship traveled from Shanghai to Haizhou, fearing that the laborers would board the ship and forcibly seize the waterfront work, it requested the head office to send six additional armed escorts to accompany the ship to the old kiln for precaution. The Railway Bureau has also prepared an armored train to suppress the situation at the old kiln. Therefore, both the railway and shipping companies hope that no disturbance will occur when the ship docks at the new wharf today.</p>
<p>Tax Affairs Department Advises Compliance</p>
<h3 id="e129">Shipping Association Will Reconvene to Discuss the Tariff Notice of the Pilotage Committee <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to the New New Society, after the implementation of the newly revised Provisional Rules for Song-Han Pilotage by the Shanghai Pilotage Administration Committee, the Shipping Association believed that the tax rates had increased significantly and the shipping industry could not afford the burden. In addition to sending telegrams to the Yuan and Ministry to appeal against it, it also planned to suspend navigation in unison if necessary to show its determination. It is learned that Robert de Keyserlingk, Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, specially advised the shipping companies to comply yesterday. It is said that the shipping companies will reconvene to discuss. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Advise Compliance) The Shipping Association believes that the new pilotage fee rate is more than double the previous rate, so it specially convened a meeting and unanimously decided that if the customs refuses to close the customs due to the pilotage issue, all non-scheduled ships that hire pilots for short-term trips to the Yangtze River will suspend navigation. It is learned that Robert de Keyserlingk, Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, believes that the suspension of ships will inevitably affect traffic and is of great importance. Although the new pilotage fee rate of the Song-Han District Pilotage Administration Committee has increased compared to the past, the previous pilotage fee seemed to be too low, so he advised Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Shipping Association, Yuan Ludeng, and other members yesterday to explain it to the shipping companies and comply with the newly revised pilotage rules. It is heard that the Shipping Association believes that this matter is of great importance to the future of the shipping companies and plans to convene another meeting for final discussion.</p>
<p>(Notice of Charges) Karel, Chairman of the Shanghai Pilotage Administration Committee, sent letters to various shipping companies yesterday, notifying them that all pilotage fees should be collected by the accountant of the association on a regular basis from this month onwards. The original letter is recorded as follows: Sirs, this association intends to implement full management of short-term pilots, that is, pilots who have not been employed by various Yangtze River shipping companies on a long-term basis, from October 1st. After October 1st, the pilotage fees should be calculated according to the attached pilotage fee rates and a copy of the Provisional Rules for Pilotage Administration is also attached. Please pay special attention to Articles 13 and 14 of these rules. In the future, pilots must be dispatched by the Song-Han District Pilotage Office. If you need to use them, please contact the office in the Maritime Affairs Patrol Office on the fourth floor of the Jianghai Customs, so that you will not be mistaken. All pilotage fees should be collected by the accountant of this association on a regular basis and should not be paid to individual pilots. This is very important.

Article 25: When shifting ships in the northern ports along the river, whether it is lowering anchor or raising anchor, or berthing or leaving the dock, a fee of one yuan per mile per foot of draft shall be charged. Any odd numbers less than one mile and one foot shall also be counted as one mile and one foot. Article 26: A. Pilots dispatched to Wusong to wait for ships, regardless of whether the ship arrives in Wusong or not, shall be charged a detention fee of ten yuan for every 12 hours from the time they are instructed to be in Wusong; B. If a ship stops at an intermediate port or loads or unloads cargo at another port, a detention fee of ten yuan shall be charged for every 24 hours or less than 24 hours; C. If a ship loads and unloads cargo in port and no longer needs a pilot, the pilot shall be provided with the cost of a second-class ticket for a ship or train to or from Shanghai, and from the time the pilot is dismissed until the ship arrives in Shanghai, or from the time the ship departs from Shanghai until the ship leaves the port, a fee of ten yuan shall be paid for every 24 hours, and if it is less than one day but more than twelve hours, it shall also be counted as one day. In any case, the minimum fee shall be ten yuan; D. The application to dispatch a pilot may be withdrawn, but if the ship is scheduled to leave port on the same day and the pilot has already been dispatched, or if the ship is scheduled to leave port on the next day and the application is withdrawn after 5:00 PM, a withdrawal fee of ten yuan shall be charged. These rules may be amended at any time if necessary. These rules shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>(Pilotage Fee Rates) According to the New Sound Society (Table 1): Calculated by the number of feet of the ship's draft, the pilotage fee per foot of draft or fraction thereof: (A) (At least one Class A pilot must be used) Wusong to or from Tongzhou 2.5 yuan, Zhenjiang 7 yuan, Shi'erxu 8 yuan, Nanjing 9 yuan, Caishiji 10 yuan, Taiping 10.5 yuan, Wuhu 11 yuan, Digang 16 yuan, Jiujiang 18 yuan, Daye 20 yuan, Hankou 22 yuan; (B) Using Class B and Class C pilots, Wusong to or from Tongzhou 2 yuan, Zhenjiang 5 yuan, Shi'erxu 6 yuan, Nanjing 7 yuan, Caishiji 8 yuan, Taiping 8.5 yuan, Wuhu 9 yuan, Digang 10 yuan, Jiujiang 14 yuan, Daye 16 yuan, Hankou 18 yuan. The fee rates for various sections from Nantong to Hankou are omitted. (Table 2) Calculated by tonnage, the fee rate per registered ton is: Wusong to or from Tongzhou 1 cent, Zhenjiang 1.5 cents, Shi'erxu 1.5 cents, Nanjing 2 cents, Caishiji 2 cents, Taiping 2 cents, Wuhu 2 cents, Digang 3 cents, Jiujiang 3 cents, Daye 3.5 cents, Hankou 4 cents.</p>
<p>(Explanation of Fee Rates) The method of calculating the pilotage fee for Chinese pilots in the Song-Han area is as follows: (1) According to Table 1, multiply the number of feet of draft by the number of silver dollars per foot, and then multiply the registered tonnage by the number of cents of silver dollars per ton according to Table 2. After adding the two products, give a 25% discount (this discount is a temporary measure). For example, if the draft is 19 feet 6 inches and the registered tonnage is 3,400 tons, 19 feet 6 inches should be counted as 20 feet. Looking up Table 1, the fee is 16 yuan per foot, and the product is 320 yuan. The registered tonnage is 3,400 tons. Looking up Table 2, the fee is 3 cents per ton, and the product is 102 yuan. Adding the two products together gives a total of 422 yuan. Giving a 25% discount gives 316 yuan 50 cents. (2) One pilot is allowed to be used to or from Wusong and Wuhu. (3) Two pilots must be used to or from Wusong and ports above Wuhu. No additional fee is currently charged for this additional second pilot. (4) Ships with a draft of more than 18 feet should be calculated according to the Class A fee rate. (5) The fee rate for ships with a draft of less than 18 feet should be determined by the class of pilot used during the period.</p>

<p>Representatives of the Rent Reduction Committee Petitioned the Party and Government Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e130">Requesting the Reversal of Hu Zaijin's Wrongful Conviction <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee is assisting in the rent dispute that occurred in Changle Lane, Diswei Road. Hu Zaijin, a non-tenant who was mistakenly arrested by the patrol房(translator unsure, likely police or similar), was accused of throwing feces to obstruct official duties and was prosecuted in the First Special District District Court. The case was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment. The sub-committees of the rent reduction committee in various lanes held a meeting and elected Zhang Xianfang, Shen Shifang, Zhou Boxun, Yang You, Shen Xinfu, Wei Langxuan, Chen Jiufeng, etc. as assistance representatives. Yesterday, they separately petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the First Special District Court. As a result, the Municipal Government sent representative Xiang Weicheng to receive them and expressed acceptance of the petition. The Municipal Party Headquarters sent Zhu Yangwu of the People's Training Section to receive them and promised to forward the letter to the court for assistance. The representatives were satisfied. However, the court refused to meet them, but accepted the written statement. The petition is recorded below: A petition to request the redress of Hu Zaijin's sentence of eight months of imprisonment, hoping that the government (court) (department) will clearly see the wrongful conviction, grant justice, request to find a way to release him, to comfort the public opinion (original). The residents have heard that a rent dispute has occurred in Changle Lane, Diswei Road, and even been arrested and subjected to pressure as if facing a formidable enemy, beaten tenants, and mistakenly arrested a non-tenant Hu Zaijin. This matter is related to the rent reduction movement. All countries have precedents, and there are precedents for rent reduction in Anqing, Hangzhou, Nanjing, and other places. At this time when the poor and distressed people are pleading for the realization of rent reduction, this unfortunate incident happened suddenly, like a pain in the flesh, so we had to go to investigate. The facts were indeed consistent, and it was heard that the court sentenced a non-tenant Hu Zaijin to as many as eight months of imprisonment, while the evidence in court was ignored, so that Mr. Hu's grievance was submerged in the sea. The court allowed the patrol房's statements, creating a wrongful conviction, which is chilling. The patrol房 is so repressive that every citizen in the concession is in danger. For the sake of redressing the wrong and restoring justice, it is difficult to remain silent. We dare to jointly sign and send representatives Zhang Xianfang, Zhang Langxuan, Shen Shifang, Zhou Boxun, Yang You, Shen Xinfu, Chen Jiufeng, and others to present a petition, hoping to be granted an audience to approve relief, in order to redress the grievances and show fairness, to tie up friendship.</p>

<p>Marine Products Council According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily (abridged above): The Hokkaido Prefectural Government's Shanghai Trade Research Institute, in order to strengthen the old friendship with Chinese counterparts and smooth trade between China and Japan, has decided to hold a council with more than 60 Chinese and Japanese marine product operators in late this month to discuss sales plans. It has now received approval from all parties. There is also a new variety of sea cucumber that will be launched at a tasting event. This sea cucumber is entirely produced in Hokkaido and occupies the largest market share in China. In the future, Japanese goods may be used as a substitute for Nanyang goods.</p>
<p>Wholesale Guide According to news from the Shanghai Business Federation of Nanjing Road in the First Special District, member stores have reported to the association one after another that several merchants have received invitation-style official letters from the "Wholesale Guide" sent from Tokyo, Japan. The letter stated, "Dear Sirs, it is a happy autumn and we are pleased to see that your business is growing and the economy is becoming more prosperous. Our company has published the 'Oriental Trade Monthly', which widely introduces the products of Japanese manufacturers to facilitate the sale of goods by Chinese merchants. We are planning to hold a sample exhibition at the Yipinxin Hotel on Xizang Road in Shanghai on October 8th and 9th. We sincerely invite you to attend and place orders."

<p>The Bao Hua vessel of the Ping An Company, which had been detained by the Qidong County Government, has been approved for release after negotiations from various parties. A reporter inquired with the company yesterday, and according to the person in charge, the company has received a telegram confirming the release of the Bao Hua vessel. However, as the shipowner, Wang Rongfa, was not bailed out simultaneously, the vessel could not set sail for Shanghai yesterday. After another telegraphic inquiry, it is expected that Shipowner Wang can be bailed out, so the Bao Hua vessel is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon, and the vessel is scheduled to resume its regular schedule tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Bengbu Salt Crisis Successfully Resolved, Salt Inspector Returns to Shanghai, Four Measures Agreed Upon, Salt Merchants Express Satisfaction <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Salt Inspectorate of the Ministry of Finance in this city, due to a dispute between Bengbu salt merchants and the banking community over loan matters, caused a serious crisis in the salt region. Considering that the matter concerned the salt administration, a special commissioner was dispatched to mediate and the matter has been successfully resolved. Commissioner Lu Siding returned to Shanghai yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Commissioner Returns to Shanghai: According to Secretary Shen of the Salt Inspectorate of the Ministry of Finance, Bengbu's salt industry has developed considerably in recent years. The four major banks in Shanghai—Bank of China, Shanghai Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Jiangsu Bank—considering that the management of salt production in northern Anhui was effective and investment was relatively secure, competed to grant loans. Later, disputes arose between the banks and salt merchants over interest rates and conditions, leading to the stagnation of the salt industry, which greatly affected tax revenue. Therefore, the headquarters specially dispatched Deputy Director Lu Siding and Manager Jin Xiangsheng of the Yangzhou branch to mediate, and a satisfactory resolution has been achieved. Mr. Lu and others returned to the office yesterday to report.</p>
<p>Resolution Measures: The resolution measures are generally agreed upon in four items: (1) Salt that has already been taxed will be allowed for merchants to sell in rotation, to avoid price-cutting competition that would lead to losses. (2) Salt that has already been taxed at the salt yard but has not yet been transported must be completely transported and sold by the end of October. The rotational sales method will continue until the end of December this year, and new taxed salt will be released from January 1 next year. (3) Salt prices will be determined by the merchants themselves, but should not be too high, so that salt that has already been taxed can be sold as soon as possible. (4) The original plan was to release new taxed salt transported from Xiba River to Bengbu at the beginning of November, but the salt merchants requested a delay. The transportation envoy agreed to reconsider at that time. It is reported that the salt merchants are quite satisfied with the above measures, and the past estrangement between officials and merchants has been completely eliminated.</p>

<p>The first installment of the field tax for the 23rd year of the Republic in this city has reached its deadline since collection began. It is now heard that the Municipal Finance Bureau has dispatched police to assist local bailiffs in urging and pursuing payment from all households that have not yet completed payment. Households must voluntarily submit payment at the treasury. The proclamation is transcribed below: It is found that the first installment of the field tax for the 23rd year of the Republic was collected on August 1 of this year and ended on September 30, with a two-month deadline. All unpaid field taxes under this item will be subject to a late fee of two-tenths of the tax amount from October 1 to November 30. If the deadline is still exceeded, an additional one-tenth will be added to indicate a penalty. However, starting from this year, the field tax grain slips for this period will no longer be issued to the local bailiffs for collection. The household owners must still bring the grain slip from the previous period and voluntarily submit payment at the treasury. The land ownership certificate will be stamped after payment. In addition to dispatching police to assist the local bailiffs in urging and pursuing payment from household to household, this proclamation is hereby issued, urging household owners to bring the grain slip from the previous period and quickly submit payment at the treasury voluntarily to emphasize tax obligations and avoid further delays, which may lead to heavy penalties. This is a definite notice.</p>

<p>The drought in Zhejiang Province this year is the worst in the country, especially in the Hangzhou and Haining area.

<h3 id="e140">Fruit and Local Goods Association Petitions for Lenient Crackdown on Street Vendors <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to rectify the city's appearance and facilitate traffic, has issued a special order to all district offices, ordering the police to crack down on fruit vendors on Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, and other areas. The Fruit and Local Goods Industry Association of this city, because the matter concerns the livelihood of the vendors, has specially petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters to forward it to the Public Security Bureau, requesting the withdrawal of the order. The original text reads: "Regarding the petition for a lenient crackdown on fruit vendors in the Laoximen and Xiaobeimen areas to maintain order and protect business matters. The vendor representatives came to the association and claimed that the police crackdown in the Laoximen and Xiaobeimen areas is currently very strict. Fruit vendors are not allowed to set up stalls at all, and violators will be detained for five days or fined five yuan. We fruit vendors are operating on a small scale, how can we withstand this setback? Moreover, the livelihood of our families depends on meager profits to make a living. If this strict crackdown is carried out, the livelihoods of our thousands of fellow vendors will be cut off and we will have no way to make a living. Therefore, we specially request that you allow us to forward our petition to the authorities and request a lenient crackdown, etc." Furthermore, the vendors gathered in front of the fruit businesses on the Dongmen Road area of the Bund this morning, demanding maintenance. The situation is tense. It is found that there are a large number of fruit vendors in this city, all operating on a small scale to make a living. Our member businesses also rely on them for sales. If the crackdown is too severe, it will inevitably lead to unemployment, and the operations of our various businesses will also be affected. Moreover, these vendors have limited knowledge. Once unemployed, they will inevitably go off the rails, and public security is worrying. Therefore, we specially report the situation and request that you allow us to find ways to provide relief, so that we can ensure livelihoods, maintain public security, and protect business. After the Municipal Party Headquarters received the petition, it has sent personnel to investigate in order to review and handle it, etc.</p>

<p>The Freight Truck Industry Held a Member Representative Conference Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e142">Discussion of Vehicle Tax Issues <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Freight Truck Industry Association of this city held an extraordinary member representative conference at 3 p.m. yesterday on the third floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss the issue of the 25% increase in registration tax in the Chinese area. In addition to representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, such as Zhu Yakui, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, such as Yuan Hongjun, 153 representatives attended, including Wang Liancui of Gongji Car Company, Chen Shaosheng of Youli Car Company, Cai Xueqin of Mingji Car Company, Gu Xishan of Guyinji Car Company, Zhang Maofa of Bacon Company, Hu Tongsheng of Huaxing Car Company, Ni Baolin of Tongchang Car Company, and Chen Weimin of Gongfa Car Company. Lou Yinchuan, Jiang Zhongying, and Huang Qiusheng were publicly elected as the presidium, with Qian Fengyi as the recorder. The meeting began with the usual ceremony. First, the chairman reported, saying in brief that today's extraordinary member conference was convened because two important things have recently happened in the industry. The first is that the Chinese area wants to increase the registration tax by 25%. The reason for this is that the municipal authorities of this city have no funds for construction (including road construction, etc.), so the Finance Bureau suggested increasing house tax and vehicle tax to make up for it. Therefore, regarding the reason for increasing the vehicle tax, it is said that with the municipal license, it is possible to travel on the highways of five provinces and cities. The current increase of 25%, together with the 10% highway surcharge, has not exceeded the amount levied by the special zone. It is also said that, compared to the roads, a special zone license only allows travel for over 300 kilometers, while a municipal license allows travel for over 2,100 kilometers. According to this suggestion, it is very appropriate to add a 25% registration tax. However, the authorities' reason for increasing the tax is based on a comparison with passenger cars for personal use. Our freight truck industry is unfortunately included in the original tax increase plan by the authorities. On our association's side, because the matter concerns the vital interests of all fellow businesses, we have already sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the Municipal Government, requesting that this original plan be amended and that we be excluded from the scope of the tax increase. However, the Municipal Government believes that this original plan has been approved by the central government and refuses to amend it. Our association then sent five representatives to the Municipal Government together with representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to petition, and as a result, it was handed over to the two bureaus in charge of finance and public utilities for review. After the report, after guidance from Zhu Yakui, a representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Yuan Hongjun, a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the discussion and resolution of the proposal began. (2) Send representatives to Beijing on a fixed date to petition the central government. (2) Send representatives to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Public Utilities Bureau to petition. (3) After the petition results, convene another meeting on the 11th to discuss relief measures. (4) The representatives for the Beijing petition will be nominated by the executive and supervisory committees, together with representatives from the Chamber of Commerce. (5) The representatives for the petition to the municipal party and government organs are Jiang Shuji from the East District, Jiang Zhongying from the North District, Yang Hanzhang from the West District, Gu Xishan from the South District, and Lu Xiangying from the Central District. The meeting adjourned at 5 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Chu Fucheng Discusses Eleutherococcus Again <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Chu Fucheng's reply to the Shanghai Municipal National Medicine Association states: In response to your letter, I am fully aware of your kind concerns. Your letter states that I paid attention to the Eleutherococcus problem and then took Eleutherococcus, which is putting the cart before the horse. I suffered from phlegm and fluid syndrome as a young man, and was prone to catching colds and coughs. I always treated it with Eleutherococcus steamed with pear soup. Now I easily use simple prescriptions, and every prescription must have Eleutherococcus. This is because I often take Eleutherococcus and then pay attention to the Eleutherococcus problem. The attached six pages of prescriptions are sufficient to prove that this statement is not false. Your letter also states that my illness suddenly caused phlegm blockage and shortness of breath because I removed Peucedanum praeruptorum and Perilla frutescens, not because the pharmacies stopped selling Eleutherococcus. However, the facts are the opposite of your opinion. After the Shanghai market stopped selling it, I bought three doses in Minhang and five doses in Jiaxing, all with Eleutherococcus but without Peucedanum praeruptorum and Perilla frutescens (please check the prescriptions). After taking them all, the illness was completely cured, which shows that the medication that treated my illness was Eleutherococcus, not Peucedanum praeruptorum. As for the statement in "Supplement to Compendium of Materia Medica" that Eleutherococcus has a bitter and cold nature and has the effect of clearing the lungs and resolving phlegm, which is the same as the effect of Peucedanum praeruptorum recorded in the Compendium, so it is recommended that Peucedanum praeruptorum can replace Eleutherococcus, I am just a layman, how dare I comment on whether it is appropriate or not. However, reading the announcement of Fan Wenhu, a Ningbo Chinese medicine practitioner, refuting the mistake of using Peucedanum praeruptorum to replace Eleutherococcus, my friend Zhang Qingshi (a native of Nanxun, currently residing in Shanghai), who is somewhat knowledgeable in medicine, recently received a letter from him, also because he caught a cold and wrote his own prescription. The pharmacy refused to sell Eleutherococcus, so he discussed whether Peucedanum praeruptorum could replace Eleutherococcus, saying in brief, "According to the Compendium of Materia Medica, Eleutherococcus can treat wind diseases. Those who cough due to catching a cold cannot do without this medicine. Peucedanum praeruptorum's function is to clear the lungs, but it cannot treat diseases, and it is too releasing. The elderly with yang deficiency and those with weak bodies are all prohibited from using it. The medicinal properties and effects are obviously different, how can they be compared with Eleutherococcus? The pharmacy's refusal to eat due to choking is already inappropriate, and the doctor's rashly agreeing to it is even more harmful." I also received a letter from Shen Gengdao of the Chinese and Western Medicine Research Society, also stating that the four Chinese medicine academic organizations in Shanghai, regardless of the differences in medicinal effects and the safety of patients, ordered Chinese medicine practitioners to abandon Eleutherococcus uniformly and use Peucedanum praeruptorum instead, and specifically wrote an article opposing it. The main points of his article are: "A detailed examination of the effects of Peucedanum praeruptorum and Eleutherococcus shows that they are absolutely different. Although there are similarities in treating coughs, there are also differences. Peucedanum praeruptorum is suitable for coughs with external symptoms, while Eleutherococcus is suitable for coughs without external symptoms. Strictly speaking, Peucedanum praeruptorum has its indications, and Eleutherococcus has its indications. It is absolutely impossible to abandon Eleutherococcus and use Peucedanum praeruptorum exclusively." This only refers to the differences and similarities between Peucedanum praeruptorum and Eleutherococcus in treating coughs. In addition, Eleutherococcus is always used in surgical prescriptions, but Peucedanum praeruptorum is never used. The "Supplement to Compendium of Materia Medica" states that Eleutherococcus can treat throat obstruction, scrofula, breast carbuncle, dorsal carbuncle, all kinds of waste ulcers, swellings, poisonous sores, sores from metal objects, bleeding, fire sores, and other surgical diseases. Rechecking the "Compendium of Materia Medica" entry for Peucedanum praeruptorum shows that it has no effect on treating various surgical diseases, which is inconsistent with the announcement published by the Chinese medicine organization, citing the text of the Compendium," etc. Are these claims true or false? I would like to ask for your wise judgment. A detailed translation of the main points of your letter reveals that the reason why your association and various academic organizations reject Eleutherococcus is nothing more than fear of rising domestic prices and dumping of foreign goods. Your bitter intentions to maintain domestic goods can be understood. However, the intention is correct, but the method is not. In today's era of scientific prosperity, Chinese medicine can still stand on its own entirely because of hundreds of long-lasting and effective domestic medicines. Now, the leaders of your association, without any academic or health basis, arbitrarily change domestic medicines, causing social figures to doubt them, which is tantamount to destroying the Great Wall. It is appropriate to be criticized by Mr. Shuoguo of the New Medicine, claiming bankruptcy for the Old Medicine (see "Shishi Xinbao" on September 21). Therefore, what you are doing will not only cause the reputation of Chinese medicine to fall from now on, or even be completely eliminated, but also the hundreds of millions of domestic medicines will be cut off along with it. Those who plan for the left are no better than you. The letter requesting the mayor's intervention is partly for the health of society and partly for your own sake. If it is said that Eleutherococcus increases in price and other medicines follow suit, making every prescription unaffordable, how can the sick afford it? It is heard that the Zhejiang Construction Department has restricted the selling price of each catty of Eleutherococcus Cooperative to not exceed 150 yuan. Each prescription uses a maximum of four or five mace of Eleutherococcus, with a value of only a few cents. Each prescription uses ten medicines, costing only a few jiao, how can it reach several yuan? The different prices of medicines today and in the past are already understood. Thirty years ago, American ginseng only cost one or two jiao per tael, but now it has risen to over ten yuan per tael. This is clearly a foreign product, why haven't I heard Mr. Chu start a plan to boycott it, and notify colleagues not to prescribe this medicine? Only for Eleutherococcus produced in Zhejiang, he doesn't hesitate to use the strength of a lion to fight a rabbit, uniting Wuxian and Shaoxing to prevent it from being sold. Considering your original intention to maintain domestic products, isn't this going in the opposite direction? I am a native of Zhejiang and have always made it my duty to support the rural areas. Protecting agricultural products is my unavoidable responsibility. If the Eleutherococcus Cooperative can provide reasonable control and limited price increases, I will definitely give it effective support, not just collude with it. This is a special reply to the Shanghai Municipal National Medicine Association, from Chu Fucheng.</p>

<p>Sincere Cosmetics Company has been established for many years and has always been known in society for its excellent products, such as White Orchid Cream, Qianlixiang, Hair Growth Oil, Face Powder, Hair Care Cream, Tooth Powder, and Dental Adhesive, which are sold well everywhere and have been popular for a long time. General and branch manufacturing plants have been established in Hong Kong, Guangdong, and other places, and sales offices have been established in major domestic trading ports and border provinces and cities. The business is very developed, and it is truly a pioneer in my country's cosmetics industry. In recent years, due to the large increase in sales of the company, the original Huade Road factory building was insufficient for use, so a new modern factory building was built on Machen Road, Mashaki Road, in western Shanghai, occupying a large area. It also hired cosmetics technicians, added new machines, and expanded the scope. All aspects of the organization are becoming more perfect. The future production volume will undoubtedly increase, giving foreign goods a major blow. It is truly good news for the domestic goods industry. The company will hold an inauguration ceremony at 2 p.m. today, presided over by Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, and Mayor Wu Tiecheng of Shanghai will be invited to deliver a speech. It is heard that industrial giants and business leaders in Shanghai are all on the invitation list, and there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>

<p>Pu Fucheng, a peddler from Changshu, 25 years old, living at No. 25 Renshou Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession, stored 48 yuan earned from business savings in a rattan basket on August 21 of this year to return to his native Changshu. When passing through Suzhou, at 8 a.m. on that day, he suddenly met Gao Genbao, a carpenter from the same village, 27 years old, whom he knew, in front of the Yuelai Inn in a lane outside the gate. After exchanging a few words of greeting, Gao opened his mouth to borrow money from Pu. Before Pu could open his mouth, Gao immediately twisted open the iron lock on Pu's rattan basket and robbed all 48 yuan of cash hidden inside, fleeing the scene. At the time, Pu did not report to the local police station and went home. Then, he came to Shanghai to work. At 5 p.m. on the 2nd, Pu suddenly met Gao Genbao face-to-face when passing by the Zhongfa School on Minthini Yin Road, French Concession. Pu immediately grabbed him. While they were arguing, Investigator Wang Fangnan passed by and learned about the situation, and immediately detained Gao and took him to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, he was sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special Second Court. Police Station lawyer Yuan Jiahuang explained the case and prosecuted him for robbery. Then, the plaintiff stated the circumstances of the robbery. When Gao Genbao was interrogated, he confessed that he had borrowed money from Pu but Pu did not agree, so he forcibly took it. He only took 26 yuan, not as much as 48 yuan. After Judge Yang reviewed the confession, he announced the end of the argument and scheduled the verdict for the 8th. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Extortion of 600 Yuan Failed, Brother Killed Brother with a Knife</p>
<h3 id="e148">Fortunately Arrested by a Friend, a Major Disaster Was Averted <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>You Fengxiang from Wuxi, 42 years old this year, and You Shengxun, 37 years old this year, are brothers who lost their parents at a young age. They were raised by their aunt and taught to learn business. However, Fengxiang was addicted to opium and spent his time wandering around, neglecting his responsibilities. Recently, he has been living at No. 69 Jingtong Village, Xujiahui Road, in the French Concession, making a living by telling stories. Shengxun engaged in business early and worked hard. The meager assets had already been divided early on, and Fengxiang's share had long been exhausted. Shengxun's share remained untouched and even increased slightly each year. Recently, he established the Sanyou Socks Factory at No. 27 Ruichang Lane, Lan Weiai Road, in the French Concession. His business life can be described as thriving. However, Fengxiang, recently impoverished, went to his brother Shengxun's place around 6:00 PM on the 2nd, demanding 600 yuan for his use, making a loud and unreasonable demand. His brother replied that he did not have such a large sum of money on hand. Upon hearing this, Fengxiang rushed to the kitchen, took a kitchen knife, and rushed out to chop his brother. The factory workers were all frightened and did not dare to step forward to advise him. At this time, Shengxun's friend Tan Lianghong (34 years old, from Ningshan) happened to be planning to go to the Sanyou Socks Factory for a game of mahjong. He was shocked to see Fengxiang's fierce appearance and immediately stepped forward to restrain Fengxiang, finally taking the knife from him. Shengxun then reported to the French Concession police, who dispatched Detective Peng Zhengyou to rush to the scene and arrest You Fengxiang. The knife was also taken into the police station. Yesterday afternoon, You Fengxiang was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Yang Ding interrogated him. The police lawyer Yuan Jiahong stated the case, saying that the defendant was detained for extortion and fraud. As the police investigation was not yet complete, he requested an extension and temporary detention of the defendant until the detailed case was clarified and a trial could be requested. Then the detective reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendant and presented the knife as evidence. According to the plaintiff You Shengxun's accusation, his brother held a knife and demanded money. The court verified the report, questioned the defendant You Fengxiang, and then ordered a postponement for further investigation and questioning. The defendant was returned to custody. The Criminal Investigation Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau uncovered a morphine manufacturing facility.</p>

<p>Zhang Jinbiao (also known as Zhang Zhongguo), a Ningbo native residing at No. 15 Bulin Lane, Gongguan Road, in the French Concession, colluded with Han Bangjie, a Shaoxing native from No. 3 Langjingyi Lane in the French Concession, and a person nicknamed "Fan Wugui" (name unknown) in September of this year. The three of them jointly rented a three-story Western-style building at No. 21 Binggang Lane, Tianbao Road, Zhabei, and falsely established the Hongkang Soap Factory. In reality, they secretly established a morphine manufacturing facility. The internal organization was large-scale, and all kinds of production equipment were complete. A wooden sign reading "(No Visitors)" was hung at the entrance. They also rented a house at No. 26 Linping Road, Xiangyan Bridge, near the facility, and established the Hongkang Soap Factory Distribution Office, which was actually engaged in the retail and wholesale of (morphine drugs). In addition to being the boss, Zhang Jinbiao also served as the general manager, appointed Han Bangjie as the engineer with a monthly salary of 100 yuan, and served as the business director of the wholesale office, responsible for the full authority of promoting morphine drugs. He also invited Zheng Shungen, a major shareholder residing at No. 15 Yihe Lane, Beile Road, in the French Concession, and the so-called engineer Han Bangjie to be responsible for purchasing the raw materials for manufacturing drugs. The daily output was shocking. In addition to hiring Zhang Kebei from Nantong as the clerk of the Hongkang Soap Factory Distribution Office (i.e., the drug wholesale facility), he also employed Sun Decheng, Wang Lifu from Ningbo, and Xue Desan from Changzhou as employees, and Ye Arui from Ningbo, who resided at Yongxiang Tobacco and Paper Store in Hujia Wood Bridge, as the cook. Liu Yongsong from Funing was the outgoing clerk. Zhang Lao Ban and the engineers had a car with the municipal government permit number "1952" and the concession permit number "10361" for their use. Zhang Jinbiao and others (shared the profits) made a lot of money and were very extravagant. However, their activities were discovered by Chen Caifu, the detective leader of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who learned about the secret establishment of the morphine drug manufacturing and trafficking facility by Zhang Jinbiao and Han Bangjie. He reported the information to Lu Yingjian, the captain of the Criminal Investigation Team. After reviewing the report, Lu immediately reported to Director Wen and ordered Detective Leader Chen Caifu and Detective Zhao Huairen to disguise themselves as shabby vagrants and secretly investigate the manufacturing facility on both sides yesterday. The doors were tightly closed, but they could smell (the scent of medicine), which confirmed the report. They returned to the team to report to Captain Lu, who added 15 capable detectives, including Wu Songshan and Zeng Wanli, and ordered Leader Chen to lead four police officers from the First Squadron of the Police Brigade to drive to No. 21 Binggang Lane, Tianbao Road, Zhabei, yesterday morning at 2:10 AM, and secretly surround the front and back doors. Leader Chen and others used an axe to break open the back door and rushed in, bravely arresting the morphine drug criminals Zhang Jinbiao, Han Bangjie, Zhang Kebei, Sun Facheng, Wang Lifu, Liu Yongsong, Shen Xiaoliang, Xue Deshan, Ye Arui, and others. They confiscated (finished morphine) in four large packages weighing approximately 200 taels, another 200 taels of morphine that had not yet been produced in jars, as well as all the machinery, production equipment, and sundries. Several police officers were assigned to be temporarily guarded, and personnel were sent to take photos for the record. They also seized a car at the wholesale office at No. 26 Linping Road and took it to the team. At 9:00 AM yesterday, Captain Lu summoned all nine defendants to the case for preliminary interrogation. The principal offender confessed that they had started on September 10th, and in just over ten days, they had shipped more than 900 taels of drugs. He frankly admitted the facts and also confessed the residences of the major shareholders and purchasing agents, including Zheng Shungen, who was at large. After verifying the confession, Captain Lu immediately dispatched personnel to arrest them, but Zheng had already fled after hearing the news. He then prepared a document to send the nine defendants, along with the drugs and the car, to the Third Section for legal action.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Prefer Chinese Barber Shops</p>
<p>Because of Their Lower Prices</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language "Mainichi Shimbun," there are 17 or 18 barber shops operated by Japanese merchants in the English and French Concessions that cater mainly to foreigners, and 15 that cater mainly to Japanese residents in Hongkou. However, there are also many Chinese barber shops that cater to Japanese residents. The prices of Chinese barber shops are less than half of those of Japanese merchants. Therefore, Japanese residents all go to Chinese-operated shops, and almost no one patronizes those operated by Japanese merchants. In addition, Japanese merchants have no strategy for attracting customers and developing their businesses, which has led to a sharp decline in business, it is said.</p>
<p>Young Woman Searched for Her Husband Overseas and Was Involved in Litigation in the United States</p>
<h3 id="e150">After Her Husband Returned to China, He Still Ignored Her, and the Woman Had No Choice But to Sue Him in Court <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Huang Baoqiong, a 31-year-old woman from Guangdong, residing at No. 47 Hengshun Lane, Xigaota Road, is a graduate of Shanghai Nanyang Women's Commercial Middle School and has a considerable foundation in both Chinese and English. On March 15th of the Republic Era tenth year [1921], she married Ye Hongnian (currently 33 years old) from the same hometown through a matchmaker. Ye was a student studying in the United States. However, after the marriage, the couple's relationship was not harmonious. Before a year had passed, Ye went to the United States to do business, and at this time, Huang was already several months pregnant. Soon she gave birth to a son, named Genyin. However, her mother-in-law and sister-in-law often abused her. In addition to barely providing food and drink, her clothes were separate and ignored, and were borne by Huang's mother. Huang thought that the mistreatment of a daughter-in-law by her mother-in-law and sister-in-law was a common occurrence in old families, and she hoped that her husband would succeed and return home, and she could escape this bad environment. Unexpectedly, Ye Hongnian did not return home after ten years abroad and consistently ignored her support. In the spring of the Republic Era twenty-first year [1932], she raised travel expenses and went to the United States alone to find him. After many twists and turns, she was finally found, but Ye was very cunning and had no feelings for her, treating her like a stranger. She had no choice but to sue in the American court, requesting a ruling to maintain her life. Unexpectedly, Ye also filed a counterclaim, requesting a ruling to divorce. The court ruled to suspend the litigation for one year. Huang had no money to stay, so she returned to Shanghai. Her mother-in-law and sister-in-law refused to take her in, so she had to live in her mother's house. Now that she heard that Ye had returned to China, she hired lawyer Wu Zhenming to sue Ye in the First Special Court, requesting a divorce and demanding payment of 25,400 yuan for clothing and other expenses for the past thirteen years and for Genyin's upbringing, 34,800 yuan for alimony (100 yuan per month, calculated for 29 years), and 7,600 yuan for Genyin's future education expenses, totaling 65,800 yuan. After receiving the complaint, the Special Court summoned Ye once, but because Ye Hongnian's whereabouts were unknown, he could not be served. The court ordered a public notice to be served on file. Yesterday, Judge Peng Shi held a hearing, but Ye still did not arrive. The court ordered another public notice to be served before a judgment was made.</p>

<p>Two months ago, a young man and woman suddenly came to Zhou Chengchang Tailor Shop at No. 55 Race Course Road and rented a garret room, agreeing to a monthly rent of eight yuan. After moving in, there was nothing unusual at first. The man called himself Chen Huasheng, 26 years old, and the woman was called Aqi, 24 years old. However, at 3:00 PM yesterday, the second landlord suddenly heard (a tragic cry for help), which was very shrill. The second landlord was shocked and immediately went upstairs to check. It came from the garret room. He knocked on the door to ask what was wrong, but the door was locked and could not be opened. He had to quickly go downstairs and call the street patrol to break into the room. The so-called tenants Chen Huasheng and Aqi were both (covered in blood on the bed), and the blood was dripping, which was terrifying. After the patrol inspected, they found that Aqi had been stabbed sixteen times, and a section of her little finger had also been cut off. She had already died. Chen Huasheng had eight stab wounds and was barely alive. The patrol immediately sent the two to Renwan Hospital by ambulance No. 83 for treatment. Soon, Huasheng also (died). The two corpses were sent to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road, pending a report to the court for examination this morning. According to the reporter's confirmed investigation, Chen Huasheng and Aqi were not formally married, but were concubines. However, Huasheng had no permanent occupation and no source of food and clothing. He (sent Aqi to a brothel) in Yude Lane, Yunnan Road, to work as a prostitute. The money earned each night was used to support Huasheng. However, after Aqi became a prostitute, she was not free and only returned to see her concubine every Monday. Her situation was very pitiful, but it was still not understood by Huasheng, and they often quarreled. After Aqi returned yesterday, Huasheng again (had a big argument). Huasheng was furious and suddenly became murderous, stabbing Aqi with a sharp knife. After causing the disaster, he stabbed himself, resulting in the tragedy. The patrol found more than 20 pawn tickets and a suicide note beside Huasheng, which was addressed to his uncle Yang Zhongfu. The letter did not contain any important events.</p>

<p>Homicide Caused by Property Dispute Concluded</p>
<h3 id="e157">Police Lawyer Stated Newly Discovered Doubts, Defendant Wu Xihou Released on Bail of 1,000 Yuan <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Wu Xihou, a local residing at No. 36 Maqi Road, Huxi, opposed his uncle Wu Gengsheng and cousins dividing the ancestral property located near his home in order to sell it, hoping to preserve the only ancestral property. However, Gengsheng and others did not understand, and on the 19th of last month, they invited land guarantor Wang Maomao and requested the Land Bureau to send five surveyors to survey the land. Xihou still intended to stop them and was beaten by Gengsheng and others, suffering injuries to his head and fingers. Xihou, seeing that he was outnumbered, fled home. Gengsheng then led his sons and nephews, Wu Fusheng and others, and nieces and nephews, nine men and women, into Xihou's home to cause trouble, destroying the furniture in the living room. Xihou then took out his self-defense pistol and fired a shot into the air. The gun was snatched away by Fusheng. At this time, the Chinese police officer on duty at Post No. 1924 near Wu's house arrived after hearing the alarm and was about to collect the seized pistol from Fusheng. Wu Wangshi, Wu Xihou's wife, who was standing opposite Fusheng, was suddenly shot and (fell to the ground dead). Afterwards, the police accused Wu Xihou of attempting to kill his uncle Wu Gengsheng and accidentally killing his wife and prosecuted him in the First Special District Local Court. The case has been reported repeatedly. However, Judge Zhan Liangce, who presided over the trial, attached great importance to it. The interrogation was very detailed, and he felt it was necessary to conduct an on-site inspection of the crime scene. Therefore, last Friday, he summoned the relevant witnesses and the Chinese and Western detectives in charge of the case, and invited the police prosecutor Zhang Tianyin and the defendant's defense lawyers Zhou Xiao'an and Fan Gang to Wu Xihou's house to conduct a detailed inspection. He ordered Wu Gengsheng and Wu Fusheng to demonstrate their positions at the time and also ordered the Chinese police officer No. 1924 to report the distance between Wu Fusheng and the deceased Wu Wangshi at the time he witnessed them facing each other and the position of Fusheng holding the seized (pistol). He then drove back to the court. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan continued to hold a hearing and first summoned land guarantor Wang Maomao. According to his testimony, the five surveyors from the Land Bureau had been notified, but none of them were present in court today. At that time, he and the five were standing at the entrance of Wu Alin's house and only heard the gunshot and did not see the person who fired the shot. Then he summoned the Chinese police officer No. 1924. According to his testimony, he was on duty at the time, and a man in his thirties wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants reported to him. He rushed to Wu's house, and a Western police officer had arrived before him. At that time, the defendant waved to him and said that he was not a robber. Because the reporter said there were three pistols, he ordered the Western police officer to monitor the defendant, while he proceeded to investigate. At the east entrance, he saw Wu Fusheng standing facing north, and Wu Wangshi standing facing south. Fusheng was holding the pistol with the muzzle pointing at Wu Wangshi. He then ordered Fusheng to give him the gun. Unexpectedly, in an instant, when he looked back, Wu Wangshi had been shot and fell to the ground. However, this type of pistol does not make a sound when it hits the body. Wang Maomao and others said they heard (two gunshots), which is definitely not accurate. The court can test it to prove it, he said. When asked, Wu Gengsheng testified that the defendant fired three shots, all aimed at him. Wu Fusheng testified that the pistol was seized from the defendant's hand in the living room. Because there was no one in the living room, he ran out with the gun and did not see Wu Wangshi or know where she came from, and did not hear her cry in pain. The defendant Wu Xihou testified that he had never used the gun before, and this was the first time he had used it. He only fired one shot into the air. At that time, there were nine men and women on the other side, who chased into his house, and he had already been injured, so he had to take out the gun for self-defense. If the land guarantor had stopped them from chasing at this time, they might have listened, but he did not stop them, which led to his wife being killed. The court then ordered the debate to begin. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin spoke first, saying that there were many doubts in this case. As far as the part of the complaint that the defendant attempted to kill Wu Gengsheng but failed, when conducting the on-site inspection, Gengsheng's demonstration of the situation was inconsistent with his previous testimony in court.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Continued Hearing of the Great Wall Record Company's Lawsuit Against Wang Rui Rong for Obstructing Commerce and Industry <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Wang Rui Rong, a Ningbo native and manager of the Jinghua Optical Company at 163 Nanjing Road, was recently sued in the First Special Court by Zheng Zi Bao, manager of the Great Wall Record Company at 152 Henan Road, through lawyers Chen Qun and Yan Shi Hua, for obstructing commerce and industry, along with a private prosecution requesting Wang Rui Rong to pay damages of 72,496 yuan. The case had been examined once by Judge Zhan Liang Ce, who instructed both parties to mediate outside of court. While rescheduling was underway, the defendant attempted to reconcile with the plaintiff through intermediaries. However, because the defendant had not shown sufficient sincerity, Judge Huang Ri Sheng of the Fifth Criminal Court summoned both parties, each accompanied by their lawyers, to court for questioning at 10:25 AM. After Judge Huang took his seat, he immediately ordered the plaintiff to state the reasons for the prosecution. According to the plaintiff, Zheng Zi Bao, the Great Wall Record Company is a limited liability company with Zhang Xiao Lin as chairman and general manager, and Du Yue Sheng, Zhang Dan Ru, and others as directors, with himself as manager and Lu Han Bang as deputy manager. The company had registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Trademark Bureau. The plaintiff previously entered into a contract with the German Jingming Factory, entrusting all recording and production technical work to them. Since its release, sales have been very brisk. The defendant, taking advantage of the opportunity of the occupation of the three northeastern provinces by foreign forces, colluded with the Jingming Factory through his Rui Sheng Company in Harbin to secretly change our Great Wall Records to the "Ronghua" brand with the "Imperial Crown" trademark, selling them in the three northeastern provinces. In January of this year, upon discovering the defendant's sabotage of the Great Wall Company's business, he contacted the defendant. The defendant, unable to conceal his actions, expressed his apologies and immediately telegraphed his apprentice, Wei Fu Bao (who was stationed in Harbin by the defendant), to stop the sale of counterfeit Ronghua records. As a result, the defendant took responsibility and promised not to issue them. The plaintiff reported the outcome of the negotiations to Chairman Zhang and the directors, who also did not want to pursue the matter further. Unexpectedly, in July of this year, it was discovered that the defendant was actually selling Ronghua records as Great Wall records in Harbin. We immediately sent personnel to purchase various counterfeit records, such as "Fenhe Bay," a duet by Cheng Yan Qiu and Wang Shao Lou, which have been brought to court today for review. Furthermore, the counterfeit record labels of the defendant stated the words "Shanghai Ronghua Company," but there is no office in this city. Everything is under the control of the defendant alone. Therefore, the defendant cannot claim that the company is in Harbin and not under the jurisdiction of this court. The reason the previous court instructed mediation was because the defendant claimed that the place of sale of the counterfeit records was in Harbin, and the Shanghai court had no jurisdiction. His intention was to use the power of the Japanese puppets to undermine Chinese law. Therefore, our company's Chairman Zhang opposed mediation and firmly insisted that this court punish the defendant as he deserves. Following this, the defendant Wang Rui Rong stated that the Harbin Rui Sheng Company is managed by his student, Wei Fu Bao, and that he is only one of the shareholders. There is no office in Shanghai. In January of this year, when the plaintiff Zheng Zi Bao and Lu Han Bang spoke to me about counterfeiting, I immediately, out of friendship, telegraphed Wei Fu Bao to stop the sale of Ronghua records. As for the rest, I plead ignorance. The plaintiff then stated that the defendant's telegram to his apprentice Wei Fu Bao contained the words "The Ronghua records have arrived, not a single one needs to be released, and not a single one must be sold. If you disobey, I will come to Harbin myself." He asked the court to pay attention to the meaning of the four words "come to Harbin myself." After examining the words, Judge Huang instructed that the case still needed to be investigated and rescheduled the hearing for the 13th of this month.</p>

<p>At 10:20 last night, four robbers speaking mixed dialects suddenly entered the Fu Jian Gui Yuan Store at 289 Xin Zha Road (across from the Niao Zhen Road Bridge). Three of the robbers were armed with handguns and ordered everyone to remain silent. It is estimated that over 30 yuan in cash (in small change) was stolen, and the robbers fled through the door with their loot. Before the robbers had gone far, the housewife of the store shouted for the police. One of the robbers, hearing the shout, turned back and fired a shot at the woman, the bullet grazing her left cheekbone. Her skin was broken and bleeding, but fortunately, the injury was not internal. The robbers seized the opportunity to escape without a trace. Afterwards, the shop owner reported the incident to the police and requested a pursuit. The wounded woman was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau, recognizing that all telephone technicians are divided into cable workers and machine workers, with cable workers unfamiliar with machinery and machine workers unable to climb poles to repair telephone lines, each having their shortcomings, and that most have more experience than telephone knowledge, recruited trainee technicians in September of last year. The following nine people were admitted: Wang Rong Jin, Lu Bao Gan, Yao Shao An, Hua Shan, Qian Xiang, Li Chun Ren, Xu Ren Ze, Song Zi Ming, Cai Zi Run. Engineers from the bureau served as instructors, and after a year of training, the trainees recently took an examination. The examination was divided into oral and written tests. The oral test was personally administered by Director Xu Xue Yu, and all technicians were able to answer fluently, understanding telephone machinery, internal and external line conditions, and principles. The written test was administered by the engineers. Once the papers have been graded, they will be submitted to the ministry for formal employment. It is reported that the trainees performed well on the examination, and Director Xu commended them. Currently, there is a shortage of such talent in the country, and it is in great demand. It is planned to continue recruiting and training trainees in the near future in order to cultivate them.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Red Pill Manufacturing and Trafficking Case Cracked on Avenue Edward VII, Trial Concluded <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Feng Zhi Ming, a Chinese detective from the anti-narcotics department of the General Patrol Office, along with detectives Wu Han Zhang and Bai Pu, cracked a major red pill manufacturing and trafficking operation on Avenue Edward VII at number 1400 and 62 Zilaihuo Street, Lane 6 in the French Concession, arresting seven suspects: Shen Bao Qian, Zhang Rong Sheng, Luo Zeng Sheng, Chen A Er, Xu Er Da, Xia He Sheng, and Lu Zhong Wen. Sixty pounds of red pills, a can of red dye, a pound of rock candy, a complete set of manufacturing equipment, and eight drying trays were confiscated and taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, the suspects were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court, and police lawyer Zhang Tian Yin not only prosecuted the defendants under Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law but also described the circumstances of the case in detail, stating that at 6:15 AM yesterday, police detectives first arrested the defendant Shen Shen Qian at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Ma Huo Road and found five bags of red pills, totaling three pounds, hidden in the white belt around his waist. According to Shen's confession, the red pills were given to him by Zhang Rong Sheng, the director of the factory at 1400 Avenue Edward VII. The detectives then requested a search warrant from the court and secretly conducted a search, arresting Zhang, Luo, Chen, and Xu. Zhang pointed out that all the red pills and machines were hidden in a secret door. The secret door was located above the floor, so the police used a bamboo ladder to climb to the floor and open the secret door. Inside, there was indeed a manufacturing workshop, large in scale. A large number of machines and red pills were confiscated. Shen Bao Qian stated that the factory was opened by someone named "Little Baozi," and Zhang Rong Sheng was the director, responsible for everything in the factory. He was also hired by Zhang, delivering five bags of red pills to Lu Zhong Wen at 62 Zilaihuo Street, Lane 6, each day for a salary of twelve yuan per month. Luo Zeng Sheng was a pharmacist, and Chen and Xu were workers. Zhang also implicated Xia He Sheng. The police then arrested Zhang. Xia denied any involvement in the red pill manufacturing at the police station, claiming that "Little Baozi" (originally named Wang De Rong) had borrowed 500 yuan from him, but had not repaid it, leading to his implication. However, the police did find Wang's IOU in Xia's home. Later, Lu Zhong Wen was arrested at 62 Zilaihuo Street. However, Little Baozi escaped. The seized items were then presented for inspection. Shen Bao Qian confessed that he was hired by Little Baozi to deliver red pills, a total of three times, five bags each time. Zhang Rong Sheng confessed to manufacturing red pills for a monthly salary of ten yuan. Luo Zeng Sheng confessed to helping with the manufacturing for a monthly salary of fifteen yuan. Chen A Er stated that he was a tea server for a monthly salary of ten yuan. Xu Er Da stated that he was a cook and did not know about the red pill manufacturing. Xia He Sheng claimed that he was being framed because Little Baozi had borrowed 500 yuan from him to return to his hometown to marry a wife, but had not repaid it to this day, so he was framed. Lu Zhong Wen's confession was vague. After Judge Zhan Liang Ce examined the confessions, he announced the end of the hearing and scheduled sentencing for next Wednesday. Xia was released on bail of 500 yuan, and the rest were remanded.</p>

<p>Wang Guo Liang, a local and owner of the Shun Chang Xiang Foreign Goods Store at 990 Bei Dang Road in Xu Jia Hui Town, is currently 26 years old. This spring, Wang became involved with Zhu Liu, a 59-year-old widow from Changzhou residing in Xiao You Li, who is a Catholic. Wang's legal wife, Xu, discovered this, gathered a group of women, and caught the shameless old and young couple in the act, handing them over to the French Police Station, who transferred them to the Second Special Court. Surprisingly, although Zhu Liu is nearly sixty years old, her charm remains. After being released from the court, she moved to the Xixinqiao area in the French Concession and secretly cohabited with Wang. Those who did not know assumed they were grandmother and grandson. Recently, Wang was bedridden at home, and Zhu Liu, due to her intense passion, rushed to Wang's home yesterday afternoon to visit him. She was spotted by Wang's wife, Xu, who dragged her into the Xu Jia Hui Catholic Church for punishment. The incident spread quickly, becoming a laughingstock throughout the town.</p>

<p>At 4:45 PM yesterday, the Zhongxing Road Police Station of the Xin Zha Public Security Bureau received a report that Xu Yu Cai, a weaver residing at 1238 Zhongxing Road, was privately torturing his wife, withholding food and drink, and chaining her feet. Police officers Wang Ying Wen and others were dispatched to the scene and found Xu's wife chained up in the bedroom. However, Xu Yu Cai had already fled, feeling guilty. Xu's mother, Feng, and Xu's wife, Zhu Er Mei (i.e., Xu Zhu), were taken to the station for questioning and then transferred to the Xin Zha Bureau. Officer Zheng Zu Han questioned Xu Zhu, who stated that she was 18 years old, earned her living by weaving, and that Xu Yu Cai accused her of having a lover and often beat her. For the past few days, he had chained both her feet inside the room and withheld food and drink. Fortunately, someone reported it to the police station, and she was rescued. She requested that Xu Yu Cai be arrested and prosecuted and that Xu planned to sell her to someone surnamed for 250 yuan. Xu Feng stated that she was 53 years old and Feng Zhu was her daughter-in-law. Because she was having an affair with a rice shop worker, her son had chained her up in the room, and there was no intention to sell her. Now her son's whereabouts are unknown. After examining the confessions, the interrogating officer stated that there was no proof of whether she had a lover. However, Xu Yu Cai's act of chaining Zhu's feet was an abuse of private torture and was inappropriate. In addition to releasing Xu Zhu's feet and summoning Xu Yu Cai to answer the charges, Xu Zhu, Xu Feng, and the chains were sent to the Public Security Bureau for disposition.</p>

<p>The Paramount Grand Hotel at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Yuyuan Road has been actively renovated, presenting a brand-new look. Since its opening, its business has been thriving. The Paramount dance troupe's skilled and synchronized dances, performing programs such as "42nd Street" and "Remembering the Bride," have been met with enthusiastic applause from the audience, often lasting for several minutes. The fervor of the welcome is unprecedented. The music of the "Love and Admire" orchestra is particularly popular, with its melodious and intoxicating songs. Dance enthusiasts who hear it almost forget the taste of meat for three months. Therefore, guests feel at home, and the hall is packed every night. The owner of the hall, not daring to be complacent, has specially engaged two Hollywood artistic giants,柯温 and 培萊.柯温 is a famous American composer, whose famous songs, such as "Sweet Kiss," are popular worldwide and sung by every household. This time, he came to China for a tour with movie star佩蒂康潑遜 and performed at the Cathay Theatre, which attracted the attention of the Chinese people. Due to their affection for the Paramount Grand Hotel, the two gentlemen readily agreed to join the performances starting tonight. Both gentlemen are proficient in singing and playing instruments, excelling in humorous entertainment and witty remarks that make people laugh. It is said that the hall treats guests favorably and does not increase prices. Tickets are still sold for one yuan, and if Western food is ordered, it is four yuan per person, and the ticket fee is waived.</p>

<p>▲The exquisiteness of Tianyi's floral and plain camel wool. The various floral and plain camel wool products of the "Golden Boy" brand, produced by the Shanghai Tianyi Woolen Mill at the intersection of St. Goden Road and Haifang Road, are woven with 18-needle board machines. They have a width of 98 inches, which is 196 needles more than ordinary 16-needle board products on the market. Therefore, the fabric is tight, and the tailoring of clothes is meticulous and even, and there is no shrinkage or wrinkling after being exposed to moisture. It can be called the best of camel wool. Recently, as the weather has gradually turned cooler, the factory has been extremely busy with ladies from all walks of life adding winter clothes.

He has been constantly striving for perfection in the improvement of quality and the research of technology. Recently, seeing that the domestic silk fabrics are becoming increasingly precarious and are about to fall into a state of utter ruin, in order to provide a clear mark of genuine domestic products, a certain type of silk recently produced by the factory has been specially named "Fuxing" (Revival), so that people in society can know at a glance that it is domestic silk fabric. At the same time, on the other hand, it may inspire the conscience of colleagues in the industry to work together to promote the sales of domestic silk fabrics in order to move towards the revival of the silk industry.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Letter <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Dear Sir, Our Old Overseas Chinese Relief Association is currently planning to send a representative, Mr. Atlassov, to solicit donations in various places in the Far East outside of Shanghai in the near future, and to solicit various advertisements for a book published by our association, "Travel Records of Various Places in the Far East." All the donations solicited and the various advertising fees collected in the book of travel records will be used by our association, according to the agreement, only for old overseas Chinese, poor and helpless young students, and soldiers injured and disabled during the European War. We believe that your country and the Chinese men and women and the Chinese government agencies and commercial companies in various places in the Far East will surely express deep sympathy for these old overseas Chinese aged 70 to 80 or older, as well as poor students and disabled soldiers, and will be happy to contribute, so that small contributions can be gathered together, so that these helpless people can survive. Our association, on behalf of the old overseas Chinese, young students, and disabled soldiers, respectfully expresses our sincere gratitude to the Chinese men and women, and we are also deeply grateful to your newspaper for not hesitating to publish our announcement. We hereby express our thanks. This is addressed to the editor of the Shen Bao. Respectfully submitted by Papaf, Chairman of the Old Overseas Chinese Relief Association, and Valsamov, Secretary.</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e179">From Essays to the Sun Yat-sen Culture and Education Center Quarterly (Continued) <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>As for the Sun Yat-sen Culture and Education Center Quarterly, in this publishing world flooded with essays, it is natural to acknowledge that it has considerable value, although there are a few articles inside that we do not necessarily need. The articles pointed out by Mr. Lin are also the most worthwhile to read in the journal. Therefore, it cannot be said that it is not beneficial to readers to examine the content of these articles.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about Mr. Li Shicen's article "The Trend of World Thought." This article discusses in detail the various schools of thought in the world's current six major cultural fields, such as philosophy, science, and art. Needless to say, we can get a general overview of the world's cultural trends here. This kind of comprehensive introduction is very necessary for us, because our general research ability is limited, and it is of great help to us to see the general trend of the world in a relatively short article. However, if the scope is too large, it is difficult to say that it is complete. Mr. Li's article naturally has many shortcomings. On the whole, although he told us at the beginning that the source of the entire trend of world thought is the rise of the oppressed and suffering masses, that is to say, the movement of world thought is based on social relations. But in the whole article, when he analyzed the various schools, he did not fully explain the occurrence of each school with social reasons, but only listed them one by one in theory. When he criticized the incorrect schools, he only argued from the theoretical standpoint and could not fully expose their social nature. In fact, all theories are rooted in society, and only by clearly analyzing its significance and role in society can its essence be truly explained. Relying solely on theoretical debate cannot complete the task of criticism. In the parts about religion and education, this shortcoming is relatively small, but in the parts about philosophy and science, Mr. Li Shicen's article cannot fulfill this task. This point must be pointed out. Because the relationship between religion, education, etc., and society is relatively obvious, everyone knows that social reasons must be used to explain them. Philosophy and science are more inclined to theory, although this theory will eventually have a social effect. The general old scientists and philosophers always deceive us by saying that science and philosophy are things that transcend society and are purely academic subjects that have nothing to do with social relations. In order to oppose this kind of deception, our analysis of the social nature of science and philosophy should be more important than religion, education, etc. Although we cannot ignore this aspect of religion, education, etc., for the reasons mentioned above, we cannot but put more effort into the aspects of science and philosophy. Mr. Li Shicen's article did not achieve this step, which is a big shortcoming.</p>
<p>Secondly, this article narrates world thought only from the horizontal aspect, listing the various schools of thought, and does not narrate the development status of each school from the vertical aspect. Although he pointed out that the trend of world thought is towards the direction of dialectics, he did not say anything about the path taken by these thoughts towards this direction. Therefore, it is better to say that this is narrating the various "schools" of world thought than to say that this is talking about the "trend" of world thought. It cannot completely fit the original meaning of the topic, especially since it is quite contradictory to the fundamental standpoint (dialectics) taken by Mr. Li Shicen when writing this article. Dialectical philosophy itself is developed and strengthened in movement and struggle. It is not a dead truth that has been cast. But in Mr. Li Shicen's article, this state of development cannot be seen. There, dialectical philosophy seems to be several kinds of mutually independent theories with other schools, but only it is more correct. As for what is the difference between the dialectical philosophy of the 19th century and the dialectical philosophy of the 20th century, and what progress the latter has made, it is also impossible to know. It is very incompatible with the original meaning of "trend."</p>

<h3 id="e189">Forthcoming Chinese Art Exhibition in London <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>▲ Initiated Following the Example of France, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands</p>
<p>▲ Scheduled to Be Held in England for Sixteen Weeks Beginning November of Next Year</p>
<p>▲ Executive Yuan Resolves to Establish a Preparatory Committee to Organize Everything</p>
<p>In recent years, London has held several international art exhibitions, including those of Italy, France, Belgium, Persia, the Netherlands, and Finland.</p>
<p>The purpose of these exhibitions is to reflect the spirit of various nations' lives over the years, and to demonstrate the achievements of their creative abilities, so that visitors can understand the relative positions of each nation, thereby promoting international friendship and leading to substantial benefits in politics, economics, and even commerce. Their value is well-established. China's art and culture has a long history, and its achievements are the most abundant and outstanding. Its essence as a representative of Eastern spiritual civilization is enough to stimulate Western thought that is highly focused on material development. Therefore, the China Committee of British Universities and members of the British academic community, this spring</p>
<p>Suggested to the Chinese Minister to England, Guo, to follow the example of other countries and hold a large-scale international Chinese art exhibition in London to promote Chinese culture and enhance Sino-British relations. This suggestion was subsequently endorsed in principle by the governments of China and Britain. The British initiators then submitted several further proposals, offering plans. The Executive Yuan immediately designated the Ministry of Education to review the matter in conjunction with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Interior. After consultations between the Ministry of Education and Minister Guo, and after a joint meeting of the three ministries, it was agreed that this matter was of great importance and that China should first establish a preparatory committee for the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art, directly under the Executive Yuan, to be responsible for the organization. Seven preparatory measures were drafted and submitted to the 177th meeting of the Executive Yuan for approval, and reported to the Central Political Council for record. Now, upon investigation, regarding the</p>
<p>Exhibition Organization, it is formally jointly supervised by the central governments of the two countries, with the Royal Academy of Arts managing the exhibition affairs. The heads of state of the two countries will be supervisors, and the heads of the executive branches of the two countries, political and social leaders of both countries, and ministers of foreign affairs, interior, finance, and education will be honorary presidents or deputy supervisors. A board of directors will be established to manage all matters. Regarding the chairman of the board of directors, Sir Lee Tun has recently been nominated. The vice-chairmen and directors will be appointed equally by China and Britain. Under the board of directors, there will be a secretariat and selection, transportation, arrangement, publicity, and finance groups to handle various matters separately.</p>
<p>Preparatory Committee Organization established separately by China is set to include the secretary-general or chief of the political affairs department of the Executive Yuan, the vice ministers of interior, foreign affairs, finance, and education, and the director of the Palace Museum as ex officio members. A chairman will be appointed by the Executive Yuan to preside over the affairs of the committee, with the vice ministers of interior, foreign affairs, and education as standing committee members. Underneath will be a secretary-general and one Chinese and one English secretary. In addition, there will be seven to eleven expert committee members, to be selected by the chairman from domestic art experts in the future. There will be several staff members, divided into groups to handle affairs. It will be established shortly.</p>
<p>Exhibition Period has been provisionally set to begin in November of next year and end in March of the 25th year of the Republic of China, for a total of sixteen weeks, which is six weeks longer than any previous international art exhibition. The location is set at the Royal Academy of Arts' Burlington House in London, where previous exhibitions have been held. The building is magnificent in structure and well-suited for the purpose.</p>
<p>Exhibited Items will, as in previous cases, mainly consist of treasures from the museums run by the national and provincial governments of the respective countries, and supplemented by collections from international organizations and private individuals. This exhibition will focus on the collections of the Palace Museum and the Antiquities Preservation Institute, and will also solicit selections from museums and collectors around the world. The items to be sent for exhibition by China will be selected by Chinese and British experts according to a set procedure, and the packing will be supervised and guided by experts. They will be transported to England in batches. The loading and unloading of ships, and the transportation from the docks to the exhibition venue, will be carefully arranged with strict security measures. Storage in England will be at the Royal Academy of Arts vault, which has iron doors and is guarded day and night by a sufficient security team, ensuring utmost safety. Regarding the</p>
<p>Exhibition Expenses, according to the British experience of the past six times, the expenses for preparation, transportation, insurance, and exhibition can be covered by the future ticket sales revenue. Before the opening, the Royal Academy of Arts will temporarily advance the funds, so there is no need to allocate additional funds.</p>
<p>Exhibition Results, if there is a surplus, a portion will be paid to the Royal Academy of Arts, and the remainder will be jointly decided by the Chinese side and the British initiators for use in Sino-British cultural projects. Previous exhibitions lasted only ten weeks, but attracted more than 1.5 million visitors and achieved good results. This is the first time that the spirit of Chinese art and culture will be presented on a large scale internationally in Europe. If fully supported and properly organized by both the public and private sectors in China, it will surely attract even greater attention from Europeans.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the preparatory committee will soon hold a preparatory meeting in Beijing to discuss and begin all preparatory matters.</p>
<p>Provinces and major cities should focus on the implementation of labor education</p>
<h3 id="e190">▲ Instructions from the Ministries of Industry and Education <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The Ministries of Industry and Education jointly issued a circular on the 2nd to the education and construction departments of various provinces, as well as the construction, education, and social bureaus of various cities, stating: "According to the proposal submitted by the Labor Education Design Committee regarding the implementation of labor education by social education institutions in cities, and the establishment of labor education centers in major cities to improve the lives of workers and promote labor education, please review and implement. Upon reviewing the original proposal, it is for the purpose of promoting labor education. Regarding the establishment of labor education centers in major cities as mentioned in the original measures, the education administrative agencies of various provinces and cities should handle it according to their financial capacity. Regarding the objects of education in cities, attention should be paid to workers and various factories. The labor education implementation institutions should be assisted as much as possible and should not be deliberately obstructed. The administrative agencies of various provinces and cities should supervise their subordinates to implement these measures conscientiously. In addition to separate orders, the original proposal is copied and issued for compliance."</p>
<p>▲ Attached is the full text of the proposal: Social education implementation institutions in cities should focus on the implementation of labor education, and labor education centers should be established in major cities to improve the lives of workers and promote labor education. The reasons are: (1) The number of social education implementation institutions in China has been increasing in recent years. The education objects of social education institutions in cities often focus on a small number of citizens, while ignoring the laboring masses who most need to improve their lives and lack knowledge. This approach makes the educational content of urban social education institutions feel empty and impractical, and at the same time, the laborers need education but cannot obtain it, which is a major flaw. Therefore, urban social education institutions should strive to correct this shortcoming and focus on the implementation of labor education. In major cities, labor education implementation institutions should be specially established to handle the implementation of labor education, so that labor education can be popularized as soon as possible and the lives of workers can be improved. (2) Measures: (A) It is recommended that the Ministry of Education issue a circular to the education administrative agencies of various provinces and cities, stating that urban social education institutions should focus on laborers as their education objects, and must go deep into the labor force to handle labor education. In major cities, labor education centers should be specially established to handle the implementation of labor education. (B) It is recommended that the Ministry of Industry issue a circular to various factories, stating that they should assist labor education implementation institutions as much as possible, encourage laborers to receive education, and should not deliberately obstruct their work. (Resolution passed)</p>

<h3 id="e195">Personal Views on Implementing Productive Education (2) Stenographic Record by Wang Gongxia <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>▲ Speech by Director Pan Gongzhan of the Education Bureau at the General Meeting of the Third District Education Association of this City</p>
<p>If we believe this path is correct, how should we implement it? Of course, we cannot rely on one or two individuals or a small group of people to implement it. We must rely on a group of educators, working together with one heart and one mind, to achieve the goal. However, can this productive education be implemented leisurely? Can we wait until we have raised a large amount of funds before implementing it? I can say that it is absolutely impossible. If we implement it leisurely, this year will be too late, and we will prepare again next year. If next year is too late, we will prepare again the year after that. In this way, two, three... eight or nine years will pass. By that time, even if we want to implement it, we will not have the opportunity. Because we are muddling through, while foreign countries are making rapid progress. Foreigners drive cars, while we ride wheelbarrows. How can we catch up? Therefore, time does not allow us to implement productive education leisurely. Some people say that since time requires us to implement it quickly, we should first ask the government to provide a large amount of funds to ensure the independence of education funds and increase the proportion of allocation, not only this year but also increasing year by year, so that we can implement productive education quickly. This is also impossible, because China is a poor country, a bankrupt country. Everything has almost been pawned and sold out. We do not even have enough food to eat. To take out a large amount of money to implement productive education would be like a dream. Not to mention a large amount of funds, it would be a great fortune if the existing funds could be paid without being in arrears. Jiangsu and Zhejiang are among the most prosperous provinces in the country, but this year, both Jiangsu and Zhejiang have suffered droughts. The land tax will be discounted, and the land tax surcharge will also be lost. Many elementary schools in inland towns and villages cannot even open their doors. How can they take out a large amount of funds to implement productive education? Some people say that if the government cannot provide money, we can ask the people to provide money themselves. But where does the government's money come from? Because the people have no money, the government has no money. How can the people take out money to implement productive education? We understand this principle and can know that there must be two prerequisites for implementing productive education in China at present. One prerequisite is to be fast, to be agile, not to wait for next year if we can do it this year, and not to wait for the year after that if we can do it next year. Another prerequisite is that we cannot implement large-scale, magnificent, and luxurious productive education like wealthy countries such as Britain and the United States. China can only use the method of a bankrupt family, saving money to implement productive education. That is, we must be agile and economical. This is indeed a very difficult task. However, we must understand that if it were easy to do, if we had one million yuan and could open three or five productive schools or vocational schools in Shanghai, then two or three hundred thousand yuan would open one school. Anyone could do it. We would not be needed to do it. Now, it is precisely because we have no money, we must be fast, and we must do it well, so everyone should discuss and study a method, and then implement it step by step. Recently, Mr. Wu Zhihui published an article in the Morning Post, saying, "We must be able to catch up even if we have no money." This method, which he painstakingly instructed us, is the method that China truly needs at present.</p>

<p>A New Page in Shanghai's Municipal Construction</p>
<h3 id="e199">Wu Tiecheng's Speech <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Significance of the Groundbreaking Ceremony for the Shanghai Municipal Stadium Gymnasium Swimming Pool ▲ Ladies and gentlemen, today is the groundbreaking ceremony for the Shanghai Municipal Stadium Gymnasium Swimming Pool held by the Shanghai Municipal Government. I am very honored and grateful for the presence of representatives from all walks of life to participate in the ceremony.</p>
<p>Shanghai has been under construction as a modern metropolis for more than ninety years. Seventy or eighty years ago, the population of the area around Shanghai County's Nanshi was only more than 40,000, and the concessions had only a few hundred people. After seventy or eighty years of development, the population of Shanghai has now reached more than 3.4 million, of which only about 70,000 or 80,000 are foreigners. Of these 3.4 million, those living in the municipal district account for more than three-fifths of the total, while those living in the public concessions account for only less than two-fifths. Of the total population of Shanghai, Chinese people account for more than 98%, while foreigners account for only less than 2%. Although Chinese people living in the concessions are bound by various regulations of the concessions, they are still protected by Chinese law. From this point of view, although Shanghai has concessions, the population of the concessions accounts for only less than two-fifths of the total population of the city, and more than 90% of them are Chinese. Therefore, the masters of Shanghai are of course we Chinese, and those who can represent Shanghai and build Shanghai are of course also we Chinese.</p>
<p>Although Shanghai has been under construction as a modern metropolis for more than ninety years, the people of Shanghai at that time absolutely did not expect Shanghai to develop so quickly and have today's prosperity. Therefore, all past construction plans were very small and simple, especially for public facilities, so that all existing facilities cannot meet the needs of today's general public. Moreover, most of Shanghai's past construction was in the concessions, which can only be said to be the construction of the concessions. Therefore, when large ocean liners of 20,000 or 30,000 tons enter the Huangpu River in Shanghai today, it not only takes a lot of time, but also the maneuvering of the ship's body is very difficult, and the loading and unloading of passengers is also very inconvenient. Shanghai is one of the largest commercial ports for import and export in China. The import and export of all goods in Shanghai suffers direct and indirect losses of time and money due to the simple and crude facilities such as ship docks. Moreover, foreigners who come to Shanghai for sightseeing often cannot see the true face of China, because everything they see in the concessions, including the architecture, the people's way of life, customs, and habits, are almost the same as in Europe and the United States. Even the Chinese people living in the concessions have gradually become Europeanized. Although Shanghai is the fifth largest city in the world, and Shanghai's development is faster than other cities, Shanghai's construction, especially public facilities, has not kept pace with Shanghai's progress. Therefore, although Shanghai has the name of a modern metropolis, all public facilities are lagging behind, especially the cultural facilities. Peiping has a library, Guangzhou has a library, Nanjing has a sports field, and Qingdao has a sports field. Shanghai, a metropolis with a population of more than 3.4 million, a center of national economy and culture, and often regards itself as the leader of the country, has completely ignored such public facilities and important cultural construction. The Shanghai Municipal Government, in view of this, has jointly planned with people from all walks of life to build the various public facilities needed by Shanghai, in order to open a new page in Shanghai's municipal construction in the future. There are 20,000 to 30,000 students in Shanghai, and the number of schools in Shanghai is no less than that in Peiping, but the sports facilities are the simplest and can simply be said to be non-existent. Shanghai only has a racecourse, not a sports field. The racecourse is only a place for the leisure sports and entertainment of a few special classes. The places for entertainment and sports for ordinary people, especially for the physical education of our Chinese youth, are completely ignored. Judging from the rapidly developing situation in Shanghai, Shanghai's construction in the future should catch up and not be allowed to continue to be simple. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Government deeply knows that Shanghai's construction in the future should not only meet the needs of the general public in Shanghai, but also plan for Shanghai a hundred years later. We must concentrate the strength of all the people of Shanghai to seek the construction of a greater Shanghai. The Shanghai Municipal Government also deeply knows that Shanghai's construction in the future is to be borne by us Chinese ourselves. In view of the urgent need for sports fields and other sports facilities for the general public, especially for young students to exercise their bodies, we are preparing and proceeding in conjunction with people from all walks of life, first deciding on a plan, then raising funds, and starting to build sports gymnasiums and swimming pools. These three sports fields, gymnasiums, and swimming pools are the most needed facilities for all the people of Shanghai. We hope that because of these three sports facilities, sports can be popularized and developed day by day. We hope that all citizens, especially the general youth, will make full use of these facilities to live up to our expectations.</p>
<p>We all know that the fundamental mass movement in China today is the national rejuvenation movement. The way to national rejuvenation is to enrich the country and strengthen the people. However, to enrich the country, we must first strengthen the people. The most important thing is to carry out the movement to strengthen the people first. The various physical exercises in the sports fields, gymnasiums, and swimming pools are all methods of strengthening the people. The Shanghai Municipal Government will never forget its important responsibility, so even when the funds are very tight, we are especially carrying out the construction of these sports facilities needed for sports, both to live up to the hopes of our citizens and to show the beginning of Shanghai's cultural construction in the future, in order to seek the revival of the nation. October 1, 23rd year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3 id="e200">The Problem of Autumn Clothing, Food, and Supplies <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Dao Qin</p>
<p>"The leaves fall from the wutong tree, the autumn air is clear, the azure sky is like water, and the moonlight is bright." These two lines tell us that the early autumn season, Mengqiu, is approaching the Zhongyuan Festival... In other words, it is precisely the season for us to change our clothes and food. Upon careful thought, during this time when the whole world is turning to autumn, the exchange of clothing and food, the tailoring and purchasing by people, and the financial implications undoubtedly represent an astonishing statistic. Its impact on the effectiveness of using domestic goods is bound to have an even closer relationship.</p>
<p>Although "promoting domestic goods" is an "old chestnut" of a saying, I think that since we are born as Chinese people, when changing our clothes and food in the autumn season, we should take the use of domestic products as a prerequisite for purchasing all clothing and food. Buying one portion of domestic goods is equivalent to increasing the country's vitality by one portion... Speaking of clothing, in this "瑟瑟 (sè sè - rustling) autumn wind" weather, everyone has the regret of "when the autumn wind rises, I have no clothes on my body." Therefore, adding clothing is an urgent and immediate problem. I earnestly wish that patriotic people, when adding suits, would mostly use domestic woolen fabrics from Zhanghua, Minsheng, and other brands. I earnestly wish that wise housewives, when purchasing clothing, would mostly use stylish and artistic fabrics from domestic brands such as Sanyou and Hongxin. It is both economical and patriotic, so why not do it?</p>
<p>As for food, because our stomachs have been irrigated with light flavors such as melons and fruits juices during the summer, rich-flavored foods have become a timely need and desire. In other words, autumn is the period when our appetite increases. Moreover, as the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, there is even more activity of buying food to give as gifts. I further hope that patriotic ladies, when purchasing "food for consumption," should step into domestic goods companies and local product companies to purchase various domestic foods. Do not buy food from Japan, and do not eat fruits from the West, because buying one more portion of foreign goods means consuming one more portion of the country's vitality. Patriotic ladies, please carefully consider my words!</p>
<p>Contribution</p>
<h3 id="e201">A Dedication to Autumn Supplies <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The sky is high, the air is refreshing, and the scenery is pleasant. Autumn is indeed the best season of the year and the most worthy of people's nostalgia. Because the season is good and the scenery is pleasant, women go out the most in autumn, and women go to the market the most in autumn. Moreover, as the autumn wind intensifies, the harsh winter with biting north winds will arrive in the blink of an eye. For the sake of making sufficient preparations and planning ahead, many families must prepare winter clothes. Throughout the year, hardworking people are like machines, constantly turning all day long. They must add some oil and glue to avoid the diseases of rusted machines and sluggish motors. They must eat some tonics. In addition, in order to protect the skin from the cold and wind, they must prepare many cosmetic creams and lotions. Human beings are born to love beauty. If they have a beautiful body, they must have beautiful clothes, and even more so, they must have beautiful appearances. Therefore, they must consider the conditions of beauty in everything they wear, eat, and use. Women's love of beauty is even more developed than that of men, so the best time to love beauty is in autumn. All factories that manufacture domestic goods and companies and stores that sell domestic goods have a responsibility to serve women. They all have an obligation to dedicate beauty. Taking advantage of this auspicious time, they should contribute their best products as much as possible, so that women who love beauty can purchase them conveniently and be satisfied everywhere, in order to fulfill the wish of promoting domestic goods. Congratulations to everyone, this year's "Women's Domestic Goods Year" is a grand event that will surely come to fruition, sowing the seeds in spring and harvesting the fruits in autumn. I have great hopes for factories that manufacture domestic goods and companies and stores that sell domestic goods. I have even greater hopes for customers who are generally happy to use domestic goods.</p>
<h3 id="e202">"Women's Domestic Goods Year" in Autumn <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>The autumn wind is blowing rustlingly, as if nature is telling us that this solemn and great "Women's Domestic Goods Year" has now arrived in autumn. The wheels of time are turning so fast that almost three-quarters of its days have been reduced to historical relics. At this time, those of us who are engaged in domestic goods should look ahead and behind. We should also look at the achievements of the past, look down at the current situation, and determine a future expansion plan, so that the future of domestic goods can have a correct path to follow, and make timely efforts to complete our final tasks and missions of this year.</p>
<p>Although the facts of the past show us only "failure" and "heartache," the endless stream of alarming import surpluses in the newspapers, such as perfumes, cosmetics, lace, and chewing gum, have become brand new records for the "Women's Domestic Goods Year," which is truly heartbreaking. But we must also deeply know that here, externally, there are the swelling of currency and the US recovery policy of raising silver prices, and the ugly and sinister dumping of enemy goods that want to monopolize our market. These two demons are actually more than ten times stronger than our domestic goods movement. Moreover, on our own side, there are still many prostitute-like women who are loyal salespeople of foreign goods. Naturally, this "failure" is predictable and not shameful. "The progress of history often comes from serious lessons." We can use this to gain a deep understanding.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the "Women's Domestic Goods Year" in autumn, in addition to striving to promote the sales and promotion of all domestic goods in autumn, we should also consider how to prevent the dumping of foreign goods and actually awaken the public. Do not just shout empty slogans. The "Northwest Exhibition" held in the first half of the year, which traveled thousands of miles to promote domestic goods, was of great and profound significance and effect. How will we continue our efforts and move forward to finally awaken the national soul of the entire China with the power of turmoil, and the intensity of the white heat will finally stimulate the rise of the entire national spirit, and make the heroic posture of the "Women's Domestic Goods Year" appear very shocking and awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>Finally, I dare to hope most sincerely that this current autumn will become the most serious period of transition for my love of domestic goods and the resistance of foreign goods, so that women across the country can thoroughly realize and regret the passing of the past, the low level of achievement, and unite wholeheartedly, be consistent from beginning to end, and make the final determination to live up to the expectations of the public. Then, "it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost." Of course, it is not only the welfare of my country's domestic goods, but also the foundation of the entire people's livelihood, national economy, and economic recovery!</p>
<h3 id="e203">The Hand-in-Hand of Domestic Manufacturers and Educational Authorities <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Qibai</p>
<p>Education is a fundamental cause of the country, and its impact on the prosperity, strength, and weakness of the country, as well as the survival of the nation, is closely related. The scope of education is also very broad, related to families, society, schools, and other occasions. Therefore, I personally believe that the handshake between domestic merchants and educational authorities is of great importance and is especially necessary.</p>
<p>The other day, I saw a bulletin in the "Education Weekly" of this city, which was a document ordering the city's chamber of commerce to notify domestic schools to purchase domestic goods. I think this is very important. Let me briefly describe my small thoughts below...</p>
<p>If domestic manufacturers rely solely on newspapers or other forms of advertising and promotion, I think their strength is very weak... They must rely on the awareness, recognition, and use of the majority of people, which is not a feat that can be easily accomplished. However, this awareness, recognition, and use of the majority of people must rely on the power of education to achieve its effect.</p>
<p>The original intention of education is to publicize, and the educated and educators in China today have a deep reflection that promotes the great success of saving the country through domestic goods.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say... It is indeed a very good and effective method for domestic manufacturers to contact and shake hands with educational administrative authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Autumn Domestic Goods Supplies <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>The leaves of the wutong tree fall, and the world is in autumn. Time is really fast. In the blink of an eye, the scorching heat has disappeared, and the golden breeze is sending coolness.</p>
<p>Since the weather is cool, a little carelessness will cause you to catch a cold, so you must cover yourself with a quilt when sleeping at night. However, a cotton quilt is too thick, so it is best to go to the Sanyou Industrial Society to buy a towel quilt, because the towel quilt can not only keep you warm, but also is very comfortable to cover on your body, and it is a genuine domestic product, so it should of course be promoted.</p>
<p>Autumn has come, and you must wear a felt hat on your head, but there are many foreign felt hats, and if you are not careful, you will buy a foreign one. Therefore, it is best to go to the China National Products Company to buy it, where everything sold is genuine domestic goods.</p>
<p>Spring and autumn shirts are also needed in autumn. You can buy Wuhe Goose brand, and socks can be bought with Ink Chrysanthemum brand and Sanxi brand (the trademark of three C's). They are also genuine domestic products!</p>
<p>Cosmetics, like perfume, tooth powder, and toothpaste, can be bought at the Home Industry Cooperative, China Chemical Industry Society, and Yonghe Industrial Company. Towels, plaid cloth, and striped flannel can be bought at the Sanyou Industrial Society, and you will never be deceived.</p>
<h3 id="e205">My Views on Purchasing Autumn Supplies <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>The double wheels of time are moving forward on the track, not favoring anyone. Now, it is "another easy year and the autumn wind is here again!" In autumn, the climate is getting colder day by day, and everything we wear and use must naturally adapt to the climate and be reformed and purchased! Alas! How difficult is it to purchase clothing and other items? If we purchase them rashly without considering them, then it is inevitable that we will be deceived by inferior goods disguised as good ones, send our hard-earned money into the hands of our enemies, and still suffer ourselves in the future. What is the point of that? Secondly, if we purchase autumn supplies carelessly and casually, we may not be completely deceived by inferior goods, but at least we must consider the quality of the goods in order to achieve the effect of "purchasing excellent goods with reasonable money." Therefore, at this time, Mr. Yang An, the editor of the Shenbao National Goods Weekly, has published this special issue on autumn supplies to meet the needs of the season, to discuss the issue of autumn supplies, and to point out the method of purchasing supplies. This is not a meaningless thing. Now, the author will write down some of my shallow experiences below as a small contribution. I don't know if it will win the sympathy of the readers?</p>
<p>(1) Purchasing supplies must be taught by domestic factories. "Using domestic goods is everyone's natural duty." The reporter has already said these two sentences so many times that they are rotten. There is no need to waste space now. We must purchase autumn supplies from domestic factories, because as far as I know, the products of domestic factories have indeed achieved excellent results, such as Jinglun Factory's brocade shirts, Wuhe Factory's cotton shirts, Zhenfeng Factory's spring and autumn shirts, and Sanyou Society's towel quilts. These are all necessary supplies in autumn. Those who want to purchase them may wish to try them on to know that my words are not false.</p>
<p>(2) Purchasing supplies must take into account one's ability. The so-called ability here refers to economic ability. Why must purchasing supplies take into account one's economic ability? Because there are some people who often do not take into account their economic ability. For example, when purchasing spring and autumn shirts, if their ability is not sufficient, then buying two to change and replace is fine. But they insist on showing off their wealth and have to buy three or four. As a result, their economic ability gradually becomes stretched. There are not a few such people in society. The ancients said, "Rather be thrifty than extravagant," which means to teach people to be appropriate. I think that when purchasing autumn supplies, we should also take into account our economic ability and reach an appropriate level.</p>
<p>Other things such as cosmetics needed by women do not need to be bought from foreign countries. Home Industry Cooperatives have excellent products. Gentlemen who like to have a small drink in autumn, Guanshengyuan and Taikang are very exquisite domestic canteens. Is it necessary to specialize in eating foreign goods and sending money abroad?</p>
<h3 id="e206">Add Clothes as the Autumn Cools and the Cold Deepens <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>The autumn sky is high and the air is refreshing! The golden breeze caressing the face is truly a lovely season! "The young woman in her boudoir does not know sorrow, she puts on light makeup on an autumn day and goes up to the green tower, suddenly sees fallen leaves flying from the branches! And enclose it to advise her husband to wear thick clothes!"</p>
<p>After reciting the poem, the young woman Qiu Jue took up her pen and wrote on the stationery...</p>
<p>My love... The cool wind rises at the end of the sky—what do you think? The evil heat suddenly leaves, and the new autumn suddenly comes—seeing the Xiao Xiao of the wooden leaves, I am saddened by the few meetings and many separations!</p>
<p>Do you feel heartbroken when you see the dumping of foreign woolen flannel in the city where you live, or are you a precious person wearing your own country's woolen flannel?</p>
<p>Then you should always resist the heartbreaking thing, and you should be determined to use the precious thing!</p>
<p>Aren't our Zhanghua woolen flannel, Maya autumn clothes, and the autumn supplies of Sanyou 212 and China National Products Company very cute?</p>
<p>Finally! Autumn is deep and the cold is heavy, you must also add extra clothes, so that the people in the boudoir will not miss my lord too much! I wish you all the best! Qiu Jue wrote at Cuilou.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Domestic Felt Hats and "Top-Tossing Kung Fu" <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>As soon as the autumn wind rises, the scorching sun has retreated, and people don't need to wear "Panama" and "cork" and "pith" hats when they go out. But it is not very elegant to be bareheaded, so the felt hat came into being and flew to people's heads.</p>
<p>Beautiful and noble people like to buy foreign felt hats to wear. At the very least, they cost about ten yuan a piece. Ten yuan or thirty yuan is nothing. Wearing this kind of hat may not be beautiful to the extreme, but sending the good money to foreigners is really heartless to the extreme. Moreover, there is a kind of wretched person who snatches hats on the streets of Shanghai. Their code name is "Top-Tossing Kung Fu," and they specialize in snatching this kind of noble felt hat. Their eyes are really sharp. At first glance, they know the value of this hat. Unless you are sitting in a motor car, they always have a way to snatch it in their hands, whether on a tram or a rickshaw. Once a hat is in hand, like a player passing a leather ball, they escape from A to B, from B to C, disappearing without a trace. As for ordinary felt hats, they don't care about them at all.</p>
<p>In addition to being rough and hard, domestic felt hats are no less inferior to foreign products in terms of color and style... and they are cheap, and a hat can be sold for two or three yuan. It is very beautiful to wear on the head, and friends of "Top-Tossing Kung Fu" will never patronize it. Why don't you all wear it?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that domestic felt hats are cheap and beautiful. As for avoiding the danger of "Top-Tossing Kung Fu," no one has mentioned it before, but I am the first to invent it!</p>

<h3 id="e209">About the Words of "Wu Yan Ji Lian" <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Zutong</p>
<p>A few days ago, Mr. Chen Zizhan mentioned the book "Wu Yan Ji Lian" by Wang Guanguo in his article "Records of Proverbs," and suspected that there was no engraved version... However, I have a copy in my collection, which I bought at a book stall by Daming Lake during my travels last year. It was reprinted by his (Wang Guanguo)'s great-grandsons Yixun and Shenrong in the twelfth year of Tongzhi. As for the woodblocks, they were still from the Jiaqing period. According to Yixun's preface...</p>
<p>...It was engraved since the Gengchen year of Jiaqing, and it has been widely circulated for more than fifty years. During the Xianfeng Gengshen calamity, the old residence of Laotieshan Village was destroyed by war, and fortunately, half of the rear corridor of the ancestral hall remained, and the text manuscripts and other woodblocks were preserved, losing only ten woodblocks... Now my brothers are trying to subsidize the reprinting to complete it...</p>
<p>It can be seen that it was once popular because of its vulgarity, but it was not regarded as a kind of knowledge. However, in that time when solemn appearance and simple learning were very prevalent... It was already very commendable to dare to engrave this kind of book, not afraid of the elders scolding it as a "disaster of jujube and plum!"</p>
<p>Because the discovery of folklore is only a little over ten years old, although it can be said to be the legacy of "historians collecting customs," under the rule of emperors at that time, within the traditional thought that "books should not be read before the Qin and Han dynasties, and words must be referred to as the Three Dynasties"... Proverbs and folklore always felt too remote and vulgar to be regarded as a kind of knowledge. His preface said...</p>
<p>...This book refers to the legacy of poetry and history, and uses praise and criticism to convey punishment, which is thought-provoking. It starts with colloquialism, which is easier to approach than books that persuade people to do good. It is really enough to be a maxim for awakening the world...</p>
<p>The same book has completely different perspectives and opinions from the past and the present!</p>
<p>According to Zhu Moxian's "Mingzhai Xiaoshi," it was written by Wang Guanguo because he felt many things in his hometown. However, this book only bears his alias "Cizhuang Sushi Ji." There are also two people who are "Gengyuan Sun Shi Can" and "Yunfeng Lu Shi Jiao" who did not mention their names. Even his two great-grandsons (reprint publishers) only signed "Yixun" and "Shenrong" in the preface, as if it was very unglamorous to print this kind of shallow book, so they were unwilling to mention their real names. From our current point of view, it is really somewhat incomprehensible.</p>
<p>If it were not for "Mingzhai Xiaoshi" saying that it was written by Wang Guanguo, wouldn't a author who had contributed to folklore be buried?</p>
<p>For example, Mr. Wu Fengsun, the author of "Yifa Tong" quoted by Mr. Chen Zizhan, is said to be an old celebrity. People used to say that "once you become a celebrity, you are no longer worth seeing." Therefore, the book of rumors and customs "Yifa Tong" written by this kind of celebrity was of course not worth seeing in the eyes of people in the past!</p>
<p>Regarding this kind of thing, with the gradual development of folklore, it will continue to be discovered. Let's record it to wait for future verification?</p>
<h3 id="e210">Quietness <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Yingzi</p>
<p>Lonely days are a little hard to endure.</p>
<p>I remember there is such a witty saying in India... "Happiness and worries have the same aversion for lonely people." Because it is like this, that loneliness can also be said to be for a kind of piercing, unbearable sadness...</p>
<p>What a truly submerged dreamland!</p>
<p>When I look back on the past, it is so unbearable to look back... And I grew up in such a deep and boundless environment.</p>
<p>However, there are also times when I am alert to my own soul.</p>
<p>At that time, our family lived in a deep alley. Every day, every day, in the clear dawn with a glimmer of light, whether in the wind or rain, there was always a voice reciting the Buddha's name, dragging a long, drawn-out sound, passing by the front of our house.</p>
<p>"Namo"</p>
<p>Matching the sound of tapping the wooden fish, "Ta Ta" sound, so slowly, slowly, spitting out a desolate and exuberant voice, after this sound dissipated in the morning air, the dawn had already penetrated through the clam shell window.</p>
<p>This, in my mood, is really no less than a kind of heavy oppression. I was afraid of hearing such a simple and sad tone. Curling up in bed. I would have to wait until the sunlight had combed through the curtains and spread to the front of the bed before daring to get up...</p>
<p>Once.</p>
<p>I woke up in the gurgling sound of rain. That sad voice reciting the Buddha's name slowly passed under the window of the small building again.</p>
<p>"Namo 'Ta'"</p>
<p>At that time, I could not suppress the exuberant mood aroused by this simple and sincere tone. I pushed open the window... The gray shadow of the unkempt-haired ascetic monk dissolved in the fine rain threads was hazy. A wisp of faint blue smoke rose from the statue of Wei Tuo he was carrying on his back, curling up.</p>
<p>"Namo Amitabha!"</p>
<p>He recited the Buddha's name so devotedly, and at the places where he paused, he bowed down and kowtowed his head on the slate.</p>
<p>I waited until that hazy shadow disappeared at the entrance of the alley, and that sobbing tone still lingered and weaved in the sound of the rain. I don't know why, but since that time, I have developed a kind of intimate liking for that lonely outsider and that desolate voice reciting the Buddha's name and tone.</p>
<p>Because, we are both unfortunate people drifting on the horizon!</p>
<h3 id="e211">Bivalve Shells Producing Arhats <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>This is truly a strange occurrence: Arhats growing on bivalve shells. Not five hundred, not even eighteen, but nineteen.</p>
<p>This strange occurrence seems to be absolutely true.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (September 28th), the Xinwen Bao newspaper published "The Strange Tale of Bivalves Producing Arhats." It stated that Tong Shuangxi, a farmer from Fangxian Bridge in the city of Shaoxing, went to work in the fields a few days ago. By chance, he caught a bivalve in a small pond. Its shell was as soft as cotton. Unexpectedly, within a few minutes of being taken out of the soil, the shell hardened, becoming like an ordinary bivalve, and nineteen Arhats appeared on the shell. This caused a sensation, and countless people, near and far, came to see it. Some even offered to buy it for a thousand yuan. Currently, Tong Shuangxi has brought this bivalve shell to Shanghai, hoping to sell it for a good price. The Shanghai Yu Ji Photo Studio, located at 498 East Huade Road, submitted a photograph of the Arhats on the bivalve shell to the Xinwen Bao for printing. However, the photograph is not clear, and I cannot accurately discern the true appearance of these nineteen Arhats.</p>
<p>Many curious people in Shanghai believe that the bivalve shell Arhats will surely be bought and displayed in an amusement park, just like the "crab shell beauties" of previous years.</p>
<p>Why would Arhats grow on bivalve shells?</p>
<p>If this is indeed the case, we must hope that eminent biologists or zoologists will provide us with an explanation, if they are able to do so.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, bivalve shells producing Arhats is not unprecedented. Moreover, this strange occurrence happened in Zhejiang, but not in Shaoxing, but in Hangzhou. In Yang Yu's "Shanju Xinhua," there is the following record:</p>
<p>Emperor Wenzong enjoyed eating clams. Among them, there were some broken and unseparated ones. The emperor burned incense and prayed for them. After a short while, they opened on their own. Inside were snail-like ornaments, with clothing and lotus leaves, which were called Bodhisattvas. The emperor placed them in a box made of golden sandalwood and bestowed them upon a benevolent temple, ordering them to be treated with respect. I saw two bivalve shells in the home of an old family in Hangzhou. Inside were eighteen Arhats, all meticulously prepared. Later, they were given to the left prime minister Dali Ma Si. To seek the reason behind this is not something that can be forced or misinterpreted.</p>
<p>In this light, bivalve shells producing Arhats seems to be a real occurrence. Yang Yu also mentions Emperor Wenzong eating clams, and finding Buddhas and Bodhisattvas inside the clam shells, which is also a strange thing. Yang Yu lived in the late Yuan Dynasty. The Wenzong he mentions doesn't specify the dynasty, so it seems to be Yuan Wenzong. I wonder if this is correct. The Fudeng Lu states that Emperor Wenzong of the Tang Dynasty also liked to eat clams and once saw a Buddha statue inside a clam shell. In short, Bodhisattvas appearing inside clam shells also seems to be a real occurrence.</p>
<p>I recall that not long ago, I saw many sideshows at a festive welcoming ceremony in Jiangwan, and then came a bivalve shell beauty. A friend hurriedly called out to me:</p>
<p>"Look, a bivalve shell spirit!"</p>
<p>"(No, a bivalve shell Guanyin.)" I smiled.</p>
<p>"(Don't profane the divine!)" He also smiled.</p>
<p>"(The bivalve shell Guanyin has a classic origin)," I said.</p>
<p>"(What classic origin?)" He asked me.</p>
<p>"(It comes from a notebook written by a person from the Song Dynasty……)"</p>
<p>I am not fabricating rumors. Originally, there is a passage about Guanyin in a bivalve shell in Hong Mai's "Yijian Zhi":</p>
<p>Yu Ji, a resident of Piaoshui, went to Taizhou Xinghua as a Lieutenant during the Xuanhe era, traveling by boat with his family. There were many bivalves in the Huai River, and the boatmen often ate them. Whenever Yu Ji saw them, he would buy them and release them into the river. One day, he obtained a basket that was very heavy. The people wanted to eat them, offering twice the price, but he firmly refused and placed them in a pot. Suddenly, a loud noise arose from the pot, accompanied by bright flames, filling the boat with great fear. After eating them, a large bivalve split open, revealing an image of Avalokiteśvara in the shell, with two bamboo stalks standing upright as if alive beside her. The Bodhisattva's appearance was beautiful and dignified, with a crown, clothing, and ornaments made of fine pearls. The bamboo leaves, branches, and stems were also made of fine pearls. Yu Ji ordered everyone on the boat to recite Buddhist scriptures and repent of their sins, and he took the shell home.</p>
<p>Truly strange, Arhats growing on bivalve shells, Guanyin sitting inside bivalve shells. The former is something that can be investigated and observed right now, while the latter is based solely on an ancient record. If neither of these stories are lies, then eminent biologists or zoologists will surely have a reasonable explanation. However, even if there are places that look like human faces, scientists will not admit that these are Arhats and that is Guanyin.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Random Notes from the Universe (4) <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Mo</p>
<p>The most superficial thing about mankind's understanding and naming of the bright moon is that lunar eclipses can be calculated accurately. If the moon's path were not drifting, then there would be a lunar eclipse every month at opposition. Because of the drifting, lunar eclipses are not very frequent. Similarly, because of the drifting, there are very few times when the sun and moon are in opposition at exactly 0 degrees. This year's Mid-Autumn Festival is considered to be very close, and it is indeed rare because this first requires the vernal or autumnal equinox to occur on the day of the full moon. (It is even rarer for them to occur at the same time; I remember seeing a lunar eclipse during the Mid-Autumn Festival, which probably coincided with the autumnal equinox, but I cannot verify this at the moment.) What makes us most directly interested is being able to see which longitude the moon is at and which star it is in conjunction with when the autumnal equinox meets the full moon. Unfortunately, this time the moon is precisely full during the daytime, so we cannot see it. However, when the moon rises at dusk on that day, the moon will have just passed 0 hours of right ascension, and the sun will not yet have reached 12 hours of right ascension. The full moon and the setting sun will be in the sky at the same time, facing each other in the east and west, which is also a spectacular sight. Many people probably noticed this, but fewer probably noticed that the sky seen at this time is exactly from 180 degrees west to 360 degrees east.</p>
<p>Both 180 degrees and 360 degrees are intersection points of the ecliptic and celestial equator. When the ecliptic crosses the sky symmetrically from east to west, the winter solstice point is at the zenith, in the constellation Sagittarius. We can directly observe this phenomenon by recognizing the constellation Sagittarius at the zenith. For those who don't recognize the stars, this is the most convenient opportunity to recognize the stars of the ecliptic. An old-style calendar still attempts to indicate the position of the sun, moon, and stars, but new-style calendars almost completely lack this. Although modern calendars focus more on human affairs and less on celestial phenomena, it will be impossible to determine the calendar completely without celestial phenomena in the near future. The time on present-day clocks is still based on celestial phenomena.</p>
<p>The autumnal and vernal equinoxes are roughly the standard by which our clocks measure a day of 24 hours. It is on these two days that the day and night are approximately 12 hours each. In addition, not only is the length of time from sunrise to sunset different from the length of time from sunset to sunrise, but the time from one sunrise to the next is also not exactly 24 hours. Calculating how many full 24-hour days each person can live will inevitably make one feel the brevity of life.</p>
<p>The system of dividing a day into 24 hours is now worldwide. I don't know if it will change in the future. But it is really not very convenient because it does not match the 360 degrees of a circle. Now, astronomical right ascension of 360 degrees has been changed to time longitude to accommodate clocks, but it would actually be more convenient to change man-made clocks to accommodate 360 degrees. The reason for not doing so is probably because clocks are used by most people every day, while time longitude is more specialized and used less. However, it is precisely because of this gap that astronomical knowledge is not easily popularized.</p>
<p>If I continue to discuss this, I will have to go from the universe to the cosmos, so I will stop here for now.</p>

<p>(I ran and ran to this house, this woman always said her husband had gone up up up the mountain. I ran and ran to that house, that woman always said her husband had gone down down down to the fields. So, my running was all in vain, so every night night night I would go to the village entrance to circle. Meeting this one, this one carrying a load of rice seedlings, coming from the mountain. (Damn it, are you here to take my life?) They always cursed like that. (Your father's fields, these past few years the price of rice husks has been cheap, your father is so poor he didn't even put down any seeds last year, but this year we still have to plant, we can only cut bark · tender trees · as rice seedlings. One mu of land needs ten loads, your father only plants five mu of land, so it's enough to be tired for a whole spring. What free time do we have to learn drills. Meeting that one, that one again carrying a load of cow manure to the fields. (You eat it and you're really happy.) They also said it with so so so much sorrow. (Where can we get a free hand. You see last year, there was no money in our fields to put down soybean cakes, and the seeds we did put down didn't sprout. But those two wild children from Huang Liu's family, with nothing to eat, every day they come to my Hengdong Three Stone to steal seeds, to fill up their mother's belly… There's also also also that that lame Dong Sheng said, looking at Mr. Dasheng, that whose cows, also take advantage of their power power power… and ate half a qiu of our field. We don't even have time to spread cow manure. But to farm, you always have to swallow your anger! If it was really someone from the family, and we could just let them starve to death, then I would go be a soldier and eat state rations, happy by my——myself…)… You think, if he he they say so so so much, what way can I think?)</p>
<p>(So good, so good. I won't manage it anymore.) Mr. Dasheng jumped up. (Awen, although he is the village chief, the village chief is an unpaid position. He doesn't eat from the government, and doesn't suffer government troubles. Squad leader, you can do as you please, just grab one at the village entrance to fill the position!)</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Wen had been running around for half the day, and had finally caught up with the squad leaders' rice and vegetables. He shuffled in.</p>
<p>(Good, Awen, go tell the people in the village that you're not managing this matter anymore. Tell lame Dongsheng to spread the word. Go, go! Say that I said it.) Mr. Dasheng waved his hand angrily. Lame Dongsheng pouted and went out. But once he walked down the street, he felt like the world was his again. He shouted at the top of his lungs, (You're not going! See if you're not going! It's an order from above, you dare disobey! Hmph!)</p>
<p>Mr. Dasheng watched lame Dongsheng go out. Then he leaned in and whispered to Village Chief Feng Wen. (If we're grabbing people, of course, it can only be Shanfu and Chuncai. They don't farm. They're idle at home, and they still smoke that. (Saying that, he raised his little and thumb as if holding a tobacco pipe.) Second, there's Aji, but Azhao has gone, Aji, don't let them grab him.)</p>

<h3 id="e215">Financial Speculators Under Pressure, Premiums Continue to Rise Six Yuan Seven <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>▲ Once Reached Outside Nine Hundred and Thirty Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market presented a reactionary trend this morning. Rumors spread throughout the market, which agitated the psychology of speculators. With short covering being triggered, the market rose again yesterday. The foreign exchange market also showed an oversupply of demand, fearing that positions would be cut off, which fueled the buying. It once rose outside the 30-yuan mark. However, the trend stabilized at noon. In the early morning, the overseas silver market, England and the United States rose unanimously. Although London gold rose six and a half pence, the exchange rate rose instead, controlled by the equalization fund. U.S. prices and stocks also fell. The over-the-counter gray market opened and retreated to fifteen or sixteen yuan. However, because the newspaper reported that the U.S. Treasury Department stated that since the nationalization of silver, it had purchased 90,969,584 ounces of silver and 13,601,000 ounces of raw silver, which was not far from the limit, and that it would probably no longer purchase silver. There was also talk that the Treasury Department was actively cracking down on speculation in gold and foreign exchange premiums. People saw that prices were low and scrambled to cover their positions, and there was an immediate rebound. After opening, major players bought in, and the price rose weakly by seven yuan in a flash. At this time, the banks were still blocking sales. It was learned in advance that the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) quoted English at par and the U.S. up 1.25. After the high, it dropped slightly and hovered, but the situation remained stable because major players bought forcefully at low prices. People saw that the overall situation was improving, and everyone was optimistic. In addition, rumors that were unfavorable to speculators resurfaced, and speculators were forced to aggressively cover their positions. The foreign exchange market also tightened due to this news and concerns about positions, and Chinese and foreign merchants scrambled to cover their positions. For a time, the buying interest exceeded demand, and the price actually rose outside 30 yuan. There was a slight supply at the high price, and it returned to within 30 yuan. After this, the banks' appetite was still blocked, and it gradually declined. Although people's hearts were stable, the aftereffects had not yet disappeared. But because the foreign exchange market was normal, there was a great deal of hovering afterwards, with sudden rises and falls, and a lack of special changes. The overall situation was extremely stable. Although there were telegrams at midday, they did not stimulate the gold market. Major players, such as Dadecheng, bought about 1,400 bars, and Senchangyong covered shorts for 1,000 bars. Yifengyong and Daxingyong each bought more than 700 bars. For half a day, demand exceeded supply, and the chips were more than 29,000 bars. The market situation for half a day will be recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 919 yuan and 7 jiao, which was 1 yuan and 5 jiao lower than the previous close. The foreign exchange market opened with the recent selling price of English at one shilling, five pence, six eight seven five, and the U.S. at thirty-six yuan, three one two five.

Fuchang, Daxingyong, Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, Hengyu, Yifengyong, and others aggressively bought, and the price rose to 26 yuan. Jiaotong, McCallum, and Silesian sold January U.S. dollars at 4375. Tianfenghangchangyong sold, and the price immediately dropped to two yuan. Dadecheng and Daxingyong then went up to four yuan. Yicheng, Zhaofengchang, and Fuxingyong were sold off, and the price dropped to two yuan and five jiao. Yongfenghang, Yongli, Daxingyong, and Yifengyong still had buying appetite, and it rose again to four yuan. It was learned in advance that the HSBC quoted English at par and the U.S. up 1.25. Yuanxing and Yuanchangyong sold at 2 yuan and 1 jiao. Hongxing and Hengxingyuan took advantage of the low price to add bars and rise. Fuchang, Fuan, Qingfa, Yong Senchangyong, Hengyu, and Ruikang scrambled to buy. Chinese merchants and Sassoon were both scalping, and it rose to 7 yuan and 6 jiao. Hengchangyong, Hengyu, and Dadecheng sold off at the high price. McCallum came out with November shillings at 625, and the price retreated to 5 yuan and 2 jiao. However, the rumors were still rampant, and people's hearts were still high. Major players covered short positions again and again, and the rising trend reappeared. Senchangyong, Hengyu, Yifengyong, Dadecheng, Yuanfenghang, Yonghuixiang, Fuchang and other companies bought forcefully, Sassoon and China were still scalping, and the domestic market was even tighter. December U.S. dollars were at 25. Although Wahbi was blocked, it was difficult to settle, and it rose to 31 yuan and a half. The supply of sources rebounded at the high price. It was difficult to verify the rumors, and the banks were still blocked. The buying under the hedging supply bars slightly subsided, and then retreated to within 30 yuan. Dadecheng, Fuxingyong, Fuan, Yuanchangyong, Hengyu, and others sold off. Wahbi came out with November U.S. dollars at 125, and the price dropped to 26 yuan and 8 jiao. Senchangyong, Yuanxing, Hengtai, and others maintained at low prices, and gradually rose to eight yuan. Hengxing came up to sell bars, and the price actually retreated to 6 yuan and 4 jiao. People's hearts were still good. Yuanfenghang and Fuxingyong added bars, and the price rose back to eight yuan and a half. After hovering, the noon close was 927 yuan and 9 jiao. After the close, the price was quite stable, and the overall trend struggled at around eight yuan. It was found that the highest price for half a day was 931 yuan and a half, and the lowest price was 919 yuan and 7 jiao, a difference of 11 yuan and 8 jiao. As a result, it rose again by 6 yuan and 7 jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The morning opening for the December new standard was 919 yuan and 7 jiao, which was also 1 yuan and 5 jiao lower than the previous close. There was a lack of trading, and the situation was sluggish. Although Chunyuanyong transferred more than 400 bars to Xing Si in the middle of the day, on the one hand, it was doing November business, and on the other hand, there was a lack of large transactions.

Only the spot number slightly added 350 taels, plus 11 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, which was sold by the Tianjin gang. In addition, there was a lack of transactions. After the premium price rose, the Tianjin goods buying price plus water retreated to 11 yuan. However, the gold exchange rate changed too quickly, and the foreign gang rarely made any moves. If the October bars were removed from the public list on that day, there would only be more than 300 bars left.</p>

<p>▲ Prospects Still Difficult to be Optimistic About</p>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese merchant securities trading market, although slightly increased, was still struggling. The silver issue seemed to have changed, but people's hearts were not encouraged by this. Foreign exchange drafts increased. The news of bandits was still bad. Many bulls on the surface had taken advantage of the high prices to sell. Large households occasionally had large transactions, but they were evenly matched. Neither the buyers nor the sellers had any ability. The wavering situation has not been resolved, and the prospects are temporarily not optimistic. Yesterday, the opening was mostly a decline, because the foreign exchange drafts suddenly hung at one jiao and four fen, and people's hearts were slightly empty. The market price fell by one or two jiao to three or four jiao, but it was not consistent. The second round immediately went up by three or four jiao. The result of the two rounds in the morning was no change. In the afternoon, the market turned upward again, returning to three or four jiao.

<p>According to the report of Xin Feng Foreign Company, yesterday (2nd), the New York stock market recovered, especially mining stocks. The American Metallurgical Company announced a dividend of $4.50 for 7% preferred stock, and all previous arrears were paid off. However, the trading was unusually sluggish. Speculators continued to study President Roosevelt's speech. Although the speech aroused resentment on Wall Street, the people of the country welcomed it. Europe believes that this is a sign of the rightward shift of American politics, which led to the purchase of US dollars. The bond market was flat and mixed. The small exchange market was very stable. Chicago wheat fell due to the sharp drop in Canadian wheat, while Canadian wheat was affected by the weakness of the foreign market. The total transaction volume was 370,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market first fell and then rebounded, but the situation is slightly stable. New buyers are still less interested, so the market is still weak. The amount of Japanese merchants throwing out was mostly absorbed by the financial community in the past. Currently, these groups are cutting losses with pain. If there is no considerable counterpart to accept this huge chip, the market is still wavering despite the low price.</p>
<p>(Slight Rise in Bidding for Yarn)</p>
<p>The opening of the bidding market for yarn in the morning was slightly higher due to the slight drop in American cotton, and the general floating was more in the market, because it has fallen for several consecutive days, and there is a slight intention to do more. Therefore, the market atmosphere was slightly higher, and each month rose by three or four jiao. Suddenly fell in the second or third round of shooting, because Japanese merchants threw out again when it rose. As a result, each month fell by two, three, four, and five jiao. The market atmosphere was tight again in the afternoon, and the buying momentum rose slightly, but it suddenly fell when it was shot to the closing, and the market situation turned weak again. According to a part, Japanese merchants sell out, and the far-term price of three-grade yarn is 163 or 4 yuan in national currency. Therefore, they are emptying the market in our country's bidding market for yarn step by step, and the market is heavily oppressed by it. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 46,800 packages. It was found that Chang Feng sold 850 packages, Tai Chang 1,250 packages, Ji Feng 700 packages, Tong Fu 2,550 packages, Tong Hua 1,700 packages, Heng Yi 1,650 packages, Da Feng 650 packages, Hui Kang 600 packages, Yuan Da 800 packages, Yuan Yi 6 jiao packages, Chang Yu 550 packages. Ming Hua bought 850 packages, Da Feng 850 packages, Ji Feng 600 packages, Kang Feng 1,100 packages, Shen Chang 600 packages, Yuan De 600 packages, Heng De 1,600 packages, Shen Ji 700 packages, Xie Cheng 800 packages, Yuan Tai 1,200 packages.

<p>The cotton market rebounded again. The bulls absorbed the amount and tightened it without releasing it. The rumors of short squeezing in October have not stopped. Generally, short sellers see that the situation is still high, and those who make profits make up for it. Therefore, the market rebounded again. However, the surrounding environment is not good, and the factory needs are stagnant, so the cotton market is also difficult to be excessively optimistic about. (Bidding cotton rose by two or three jiao) The opening of the bidding cotton market in the morning was tighter because the bulls did not move, and American cotton fell slightly. The profit-making shorts in the market made up for it. Each month rose by five points to one or two jiao. The situation was still high in the afternoon. Most people predicted that American cotton would rebound. Each month rose by one jiao to one and a half jiao. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 141,500 dan. It was found that Yuan Xing Chang sold 5,600 dan, Tong Fu 16,500 dan, Heng Yi 5,400 dan, Ren Feng 5,400 dan, Da Chang 7,300 dan, Yong Da 1,300 dan, Xin Cheng 2,000 dan, Run Kang 1,900 dan, Xie Sheng 2,800 dan, De Ji 1,700 dan.

<p>(Cotton Sales are Still Sluggish) The spot cotton is very light. Each factory cuts off the intention because the price of yarn does not rise. The source counts 2,020 packages of Yao cotton and 1,500 packages of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Sha Shi Hua 39.25 Dong Mian Xing sold 200 pieces of spot goods at the pier.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was tired at first due to the lack of important buyers and bad news from Liverpool. Then, it slightly recovered due to short covering. As a result, spot goods did not move, and futures fell by one to seven pounds. British cotton futures fell by one to four posts. Indian cotton fell first due to the liquidation of bulls, and then recovered due to purchases by brokers and European exporters. As a result, Apple Er and Aomla fell by 2.5 Robbie, and Bai Luo Creek fell by 1 Robbie. The original electricity recording is on the left (2nd): American cotton compared with the previous day, the combined national currency, British cotton compared with the previous day, the combined national currency 112.4 fell 7 37.40 16.66 fell 1 41.90 12 12.29 1 37.80 16.615 41.50 112.552 37.90 126.615 41.50 312.43 flat 38.20 16.594 41.40 512.473 38.30 26.584 41.50 712.533 38.50 Current 12.30 flat 38.40 Ping Guoer 129.25 fell 2.50 18.80 Aomla 179.252.50 26.00 Bai Luo Creek 208.001.00 30.30</p>

<p>▲ The flour exchange changes to collecting a security deposit, and all transactions are 500 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, each month's offer for foreign wheat fell again, with Chicago falling about 3 or 4 jiao, and Canada falling about 1 yuan or 1 jiao. When the market opened, the market atmosphere was extremely weak, and after the step-by-step crash, most customers lacking strength had to stop. Therefore, the opening price of this month plummeted to 2 yuan and 1 jiao (down 8 fen from the previous day). This price is equivalent to the market price two or three months ago. However, opening to the far term, because the silver money gangs heard that they were active again, the buying intention was very strong, so the market price only fell 3 or 4 fen, and there was little huge fluctuation. Therefore, the subsequent rounds gradually rebounded. This month, the factory slightly made up for the rebound, especially Lian. By the time the afternoon market opened, trading had turned light, and the market atmosphere had turned calm. Because the exchange, in view of the excessive decline, was too risky, from now on, all buying and selling security deposits will be changed to 500 yuan. This situation is tantamount to restricting speculative activities, so the transaction is less, and the market is also stable. As a result, this month rebounded 7 fen from the previous opening, still down 1 fen before the market closed, November fell 1 fen and 2.5 li, December fell 1 fen and a half, January and February did not move, and March was still postponed.</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market showed a trend of falling first and then rising after opening in the morning and afternoon. The foreign wheat offer fell by about 3 or 4 jiao in Chicago and about 1 yuan to 1 jiao in Canada. Therefore, when opening the price, the market atmosphere was still unstable. The opening price of this month, although as low as 3 yuan, 2 jiao, 3 or 4 fen, and November was as low as 3 jiao, 2 jiao, and 3 fen, fell about 5 or 6 fen from the previous day. The price of each month in the far term was stable because the decline in the flour market was still flat. By the time the afternoon market opened, the flour market had fallen and stabilized, and there was no change in the foreign wheat offer. Yesterday, it was called between 4 yuan, 6 jiao, 2 or 3 fen, so the thoughts of people in the industry became slightly active. The recent rebound was nearly Jiao, and the far term was 7 or 8 fen. As a result, this month was better than 4 fen, November was better than 2 fen, December was better than 1 fen, January was better than 2 fen, and February was better than 6 fen. The current wheat price is still sluggish due to the factory's stomach, and there is no delivery. The current wheat opened 6,000 bags, which were bought by Shen Da Xin Da, and the price was 3 yuan, 3 jiao to 3 yuan and 2 fen. Chicago wheat October 1st closing October 2nd closing up and down December 100.15 99.00 fell 1.125 May 100.375 99.125 fell 1.25 July 95.00 93.75 fell 1.25 Spot 109.50 no market Canadian wheat October 81.00 77.625 fell 3.375 December 82.00 78.625 fell 3.575 May 87.00 83.75 fell 3.625 Spot 81.25 77.875 fell 3.375</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market conditions of foreign passenger indica rice were quite lively. Because the weather was overcast and rainy, people's hearts were hopeful. Although more than two lots of foreign rice had arrived, the market turned around. The market price in the producing area had stabilized, and the hoarders lacked the intention to depreciate the price. Yesterday, the passenger indica rice was taken up by Jiujiang Changban, and the foreign rice was brought up by it. If it rains tomorrow and the digestion is still active, the market goods must be optimistic. The whole market opened 500 bags of Saigon rice, the price was 10 yuan, 3 or 4 jiao, and 95 bags of Annam Gen, the price was 10 yuan and 4 jiao. Passenger aircraft rice was noticed by the Jiujiang gang yesterday. The old goods stored in the market suddenly became lively. It was planned to take away 550 bags of Hunan aircraft rice, 5,000 bags of factory aircraft rice, and 3,500 bags of Zhangzhou aircraft rice. A total of about 2,000 bags of brown rice were removed from the inland of this street. Although the market price has not risen, the market is very lively. In the future, if the market is digested again, it must be gradually developed.</p>

<p>▲ Hou Xin Geng fell by two jiao</p>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, the source of each gang was only 16 or 17 (a total of 2,200 or 300 stones of goods). Most of them were new goods. The rain continued, and people's hearts were not upward. Few buyers came to the market, and many dealers were watching. Therefore, the situation was quiet, and the market was tired. If the medium-quality new and thin brocade of Baige kiln is stable, this is because there are few goods. Observing from Hou Xin Geng, the source is more abundant, which leads to a fall of two feet, and Xin Du Yangjian Jiao Bai Jiao, etc., are all soft. Chang Gang Xi Xin has been listed today, and the goods are still acceptable, so the market color is quite fresh, and the price is 11 yuan. As for all kinds of broken pans, because the time is falling, there is no revival of interest, and the market is chaotic, and there is no fixed standard. Bian Yuan has no Xuan, and Xin Yin Yuan is the same.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, there were 36 or 37 sources from the river. The rain did not stop, and the sales of various goods in the market were sluggish. The price of the medium-quality Xi Xin Geng and Bian Yuan was 2 jiao short, and the price of Xin Du Jian and Gao Xi Xin Geng was slightly 1 jiao for the medium-quality white broken. There are not many new Yang Jian goods, and the price is stable. The rest of the prices are soft. However, the kiln Sui Baige rice is less than the unified market goods, and the appetite is still acceptable, and the price is plump.</p>

<p>Since Dongyang suffered from this typhoon, the factories in Osaka have no hope of recovery for a while. Because of Dong Bai Tie, Xin Qian Si and other kinds of Tie Lu, they are not able to come to Shen for a while, so the market in this port has reported rising prices. Dong Bai Tie rose by 2 or 3 jiao, and each 6-foot sheet is estimated at 1 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, and the 7-foot sheet is 1 yuan and 4 jiao and a half. The market conditions of Xin Qian Si are also good for 2 or 3 jiao. No. 10 is sold for 8 yuan and 4 jiao per bundle, No. 11 is 8 yuan and 5 jiao, No. 12 is 8 yuan and 6 jiao and a half, No. 13 is 8 yuan and 9 jiao, No. 14 is 9 yuan and 2 jiao, No. 15 is 9 yuan and 5 jiao, No. 16 is 9 yuan and 6 jiao, No. 17 is 9 yuan and 8 jiao, No. 18 is 9 yuan and 9 jiao, No. 19 is 10 yuan and 1 jiao and a half, No. 20 is 10 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, No. 21 is 11 yuan and 1 jiao, No. 22 is 11 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, No. 23 is 12 yuan, No. 24 is 12 yuan and 5 jiao, and No. 25 is 12 yuan and 7 jiao and a half.</p>

<p>Jia Duocai smiled and said, "I guessed it right away. You must have gone to the Tobacco Tax Bureau to see the director. Did you see him?" Li Shilian said, "You underestimate me. Besides him, I don't make friends with others?" Early this morning, Director Wu sent his own car to the door of the hotel to take me to visit Zhouling. Originally, he wanted to send me off himself, but a public affair happened temporarily, so he had to send his most popular person, Section Chief Chang, who is also a secretary, to go with him. When crossing Xianyang Ancient Ferry, we got on the boat, and others got off the boat. I saw such a girl. Actually, she's not a child, about sixteen or seventeen years old." Jia Duocai put down his chopsticks, looked at him, and asked, "Is that floral jacket a large hibiscus?" Li Shilian said, "How can I see it so realistically? But a large flower is good." Jia Duocai said, "Is it an oval face, with a chin that is not very sharp?" Li Shilian said, "Yes, you're here, they're here too, you go find them." At that time, the two people were talking happily, and unknowingly ate up the two pots of wine in front of them. According to Jia Duocai's excitement, he had to ask for another pot of wine, but Li Shilian said, "I'm afraid Section Chief Chang will come to talk later, so I dare not get drunk." Only then did he stop the wine, and each ate. After the meal, I returned to Little Western Heaven, and it was already dark. Walking to the center of the street, on that straight tree pole, hung an oil lamp as big as a vegetable bowl, and the wick was burning and roaring. Li Shilian said, "Xi'an is such a big city, and there is no electricity yet. This is really a shortcoming." As he was saying this, he heard a very delicate voice coming to his ears, "Look, look, there's another one here. This lamp is so bright that if a needle falls on the ground, you can pick it up." Looking, the person who said this was an oval-faced girl wearing a floral jacket. (32)</p>
<h3 id="e230">Apricot Spring Bridge Moon String <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Nanguongsheng</p>
<p>On the eighteenth day of August, Suzhou has the grand event of the Apricot Spring Bridge Moon String in Stone Lake. According to legend, on the morning of this day, it is the seventeenth night. The bright moon in the sky seen on the Apricot Spring Bridge in Stone Lake can be reflected in the lake, forming a string, as if there are many bright moons appearing in the sky. For what reason, I can't tell you why, but going to Stone Lake to see the Apricot Spring Bridge Moon String on August 18 has become the purpose of Suzhou people's entertainment, and all the engraved articles over the years.</p>
<p>One side of Stone Lake is Shangfang Mountain. There is nothing on the mountain except a Wutong Temple, which is actually a deserted mountain. The Wutong was very magical in the former Qing Dynasty, so I don't know how many people went to the mountain to burn incense, especially on the eighteenth day. On this day, the witches in the villages along the mountain and in the city borrowed this to call out. On this day, they wore white skirts and white clothes, running from the mountain to the foot of the mountain, and from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain, which is called jumping witch, falsely saying that there is a god protecting them and attaching to their bodies, deceiving the foolish women who burn incense. After Su Fu Tang Wenzheng drove out the Wutong God, the magic of the Wutong God was gone, but those witches still jumped their witches on this day, which can be regarded as a scene of the Apricot Spring Bridge Moon String. In the past, there were many ships from all directions to Chaosan in Stone Lake, selling boxing, burning incense, walking rope, doing business, plus Suzhou people to Taihu Lake to play flower boats and painted boats, countless, crowded a small Stone Lake, and they were full of flower lanterns, banquets opened grapes, Shengge all night, scholars and women like clouds, it is a rare grand meeting.</p>

<p>General Deng Tiemei, the leader of the Northeast Volunteer Army, was executed on the night of September 28 in the Republic of China. It is a natural result that General Deng sought benevolence and got benevolence. Have you ever seen Yue Fei and Wen Tianxiang surrender to the enemy? I hope that the people of the country will remember this day, September 28, as deeply as September 18 in their hearts, and prepare to move forward one day, stepping on the blood of General Deng, and avenge General Deng.</p>
<h3 id="e232">How to Develop the Northwest? <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>(Developing the Northwest,) Since this slogan was shouted out by the general public, almost some people have paid considerable attention to it; knowing that it is not a matter of empty talk, but relies entirely on the efforts of practical work.</p>
<p>How can the Northwest be developed? This is naturally a question that expects to be answered.</p>
<p>In fact, the Northwest has been suffering from drought for years. Farmers are always shouting about drought all year round. People who live in famine are already very satisfied if they can hope to avoid starvation. It is simply equal to whipping a critically ill camel to ask them to share their strength from themselves to develop their own treasures, and calling it to carry heavy loads on a vague and unknowable journey. It is indeed extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Therefore, the major and difficult task of developing the Northwest does not only rely on their own willingness to seek development, but also relies on various assistance from other aspects.</p>
<p>We know that the amount of water in the Northwest, such as Shaanxi and Gansu, is extremely scarce, and farmers naturally feel extremely difficult to cultivate. We will leave aside the problem of developing the rich resources of the Northwest for the time being. However, the preliminary basic work is still how to build canals and how to facilitate the communication of waterways.</p>
<p>Everything must start from construction, so that the rich treasures of the Northwest can rely on scientific methods to complete its initial attempt to develop. This advocacy theory is naturally considered by the general public to be the most appropriate and excellent method. Like the movie (Go to the Northwest) being staged in Xinguang these days, it also provides a very obvious point for this, and I hope everyone will give the same enthusiastic promotion and support, and develop the actual treasures of our barren Northwest into the only rich source of our Northwest.</p>
<p>Expecting that all practical workers will complete this great wish and work hard to develop the rich treasures of our Northwest.</p>

<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Confucius is the most remarkable figure in Chinese history. Anyone who has read a little knows something of his deeds. The Empress Dowager also absolutely worshiped this old master. She also memorized many of Confucius’s words. Whenever she reviewed memorials or taught her subordinates, she often liked to quote a few sentences, seemingly to increase the confidence of those who read or heard them.</p>
<p>The above two paragraphs were brought to mind because I wrote about the Empress Dowager humming Li Bai’s poem "Spring Dawn" in the carriage, and it has little to do with this chapter of the book. Now let us stop there.</p>
<p>In retrospect, this trip to the Northeast was not an arduous long journey for the Empress Dowager, but it was still very hard for an elderly person accustomed to a pampered life! However, at that time, she herself did not feel it. This was because she was stimulated by a kind of excitement in her heart, and she only wanted to return to the homeland of her own ancestors! Yehe Nara (the Empress Dowager's mother's surname), to the old garden where she grew up (which is also where the author's ancestors grew up), so her spirit was particularly invigorated, and she easily overcame the fatigue she suffered physically. During the heyday of the Qing Dynasty, Emperor Qianlong once returned to Fengtian, but apart from this heroic and promising emperor, the Empress Dowager was the first among the emperors and empresses of the Qing Dynasty to return to her hometown. I think she must have had extremely warm expectations for the various scenes of her hometown.</p>
<p>The day after we passed Tianjin, the train gradually approached the world-famous Shanhaiguan. (142)</p>
<p>▲ P.S. Yesterday, I received a message from Mr. Yi: According to the Qing system, only banner officials could refer to themselves as "slave," so when Yuan Shikai met the Empress Dowager Cixi, he used "your subject." I hereby correct this and thank Duke Yi.</p>

<p>A new family has moved into our tenement building. The head of the family is nearly sixty years old and surnamed Wu, but his wife is only about twenty-five or twenty-six years old.</p>
<p>After a week, we became familiar with each other, and we chatted. I discovered in our conversations that Mrs. Wu was an extraordinary woman.</p>
<p>According to her, she left the customs at the age of sixteen. Her husband died within a year. Two months later, she had a relationship with a man she was living with, so she broke away from her husband's family and went outside to start a family. After living together for half a year, they separated due to disagreements. Then, she fell in love with an employee of a certain company out of friendship and got married formally. A year later, she suddenly discovered that her husband was already married, so she broke free again. Several months later, she became inextricably linked with a certain comprador. This time, she was openly a concubine. However, after living together for a year, she felt that although the comprador spent money freely, his temper was too bad and it was really not easy to please him, so they both agreed to separate. Later, she encountered a certain military officer, and they became devoted to each other. Then, she followed her husband, traveling all over the country for more than two years, and their relationship was very good. But unfortunately, he was injured and died in a certain war. So she came back and married a clerk from a silk shop and became a formal couple. This silk shop clerk was born with a gambling habit and often gambled all night without returning. After several quarrels, she had to seek another way out. Last year, she married Mr. Wu as a concubine. Mr. Wu is the manager of a tea shop.</p>

<p>— Shi Cheng</p>
<p>In Chinese martial arts, Shaolin is the most respected. Branches and factions have multiplied, and the true essence has gradually been lost. Wudang rose up, competing for dominance. Its schools are divided into internal and external, excluding dissidents, and factions fighting each other like fire and water, which has been criticized by the world. Wudang is an internal school. Its practice lies in preserving the spirit and breath, and strengthening the internal organs. Therefore, Tai Chi boxing emphasizes intention rather than strength. Shaolin is an external school. Its purpose is to forge muscles and bones and strengthen the body. Therefore, tiger, leopard, crane, snake, ape and other boxing styles all emphasize agility, strength and might. The methods are different, and the paths are naturally different. The external school despises the internal school as unable to withstand a single blow, and the internal school mocks the external school as an iron cabinet containing porcelain. (Because their leg muscles are hard as iron, while the internal organs in their abdomens are as fragile as porcelain.) They each consider themselves superior and despise each other. In fact, there are many internal schools in Shaolin, which cannot be generalized; and there are also many outstanding people in the external schools. Which is inferior and which is superior depends on the depth of their skills, and cannot be judged by school or faction.</p>
<p>Shaolin boxing began with Bodhidharma. Bodhidharma was the first patriarch of Zen Buddhism in the East. After failing to achieve his goals with Emperor Wu of Liang, he retired to Mount Song and faced the wall in Shaoshi Temple. Although he realized his original nature and saw his true nature, he sat motionless for nine years, and his legs were ruined. Therefore, he used the method of clenching his fists with both hands to forge his muscles and bones. After accumulating merit for a long time, the muscles could be moved when he clenched his fists, from the arm to the shoulder, to the neck, to the chest and back, to the abdomen, to the arms, gradually to the thighs, legs, and even the heels. His legs were able to return to their original state, and he could move as usual. The world only knows that the Yijin Jing and Xisui Jing are the supreme secrets of the Shaolin school! The Xisui Jing will not be discussed for the time being, but the above-mentioned method of clenching the fists is the first twelve sections of the Yijin Jing. (The Yijin Jing published in recent bookstores is not without discrepancies with the true teachings. The true kung fu is plain and unremarkable, while the published versions are not without showing off strangeness and flaunting wonders.)</p>
<p>The Wudang school was founded by Zhang Sanfeng in the early Ming Dynasty. Sanfeng was a Taoist priest. Taoist cultivation takes condensing the spirit and refining the Qi as the first priority. The so-called refining elixir is their terminology. Therefore, Taoist priests are also called refiners or complete truths. Refining means refining Qi; complete truth means completing their truth. (Excluding those who specialize in catching demons and worshiping repentances, who were under the jurisdiction of Zhang Tianshi of Longhu Mountain before the Republic of China.) The method began with the medical school's "Su Wen" and "Ling Shu"; originated from the ancient guiding techniques; Chisong and Zijing both have special books, and Hua Tuo's Five Animal Frolics is its variation. Chen Xiyi of the Song Dynasty wrote "Twenty-Four Qi Healing Sitting Exercises," which is even more refined. Sanfeng integrated guiding, refining Qi, Shaolin martial arts and other techniques into one furnace; integrating and connecting them, he achieved this unique skill. Therefore, his superior kung fu is still in refining essence, refining Qi, and refining spirit. Tai Chi boxing is only used to exercise the body, making it lively, relaxing muscles, and smoothing the flow of Qi and blood! The secrets of Wudang are not exhausted here.</p>
<p>There are many martial artists in Pudong, all descendants of Shaolin. Leaving aside those whose attainments are profound but whose names are unknown, according to what I have heard, Qin Heqi, Xu Xifan, and Gu Yuanxiu were all famous figures of their time. Now Qin and Xu have both passed away, and among the younger generation, only Gu Yuanxiu is like a rare surviving fruit.</p>
<p>Qin Jun Heqi was a friend of mine despite the age gap. His ancestors were originally from Shandong. His ninth ancestor, Gong Haichuan, was a disciple of Gong Lin. He moved to Pudong. Jun inherited his family learning and attained great depths. He practiced internal family boxing in the Shaolin school. His family business was traumatology, and his circle of friends was wide. He was a good friend of Huo Yuanjia, whose name shook the country. During the Shanghai National Martial Arts Examination, he served as the director of traumatology rescue. The unsavory stories about his life have been used as materials for "Biographies of Modern Knights and Heroes." Therefore, they have been popular for a long time and will not be repeated. Novelists may have exaggerated and embellished them, but the records are all facts and not castles in the air.</p>
<p>Xu and Gu were strangers to me at first, and I only knew that they were masters of national martial arts. My friend Jin told me anecdotes about the two gentlemen, one for each, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>Xu Jun had an argument with his two nephews over something. The nephews were also strong and wanted to make trouble for him. Jun lightly grasped their arms and dragged them, and the nephews could not stop. Then he released them and smiled and said: (Young people, don't be so aggressive!) The sleeves of the nephews' short shirts made of homespun suddenly fell off. Taking them and looking at them, the breaks were like knife cuts. The place where he grabbed them was Jun's grip. But the sleeves of the long shirts outside were completely unharmed, and the skin was not injured at all. What amazing skill!</p>
<p>Gu Jun once lived in the home of lawyer Ma Youren. Several strong men thought of testing his skills. So they placed two rope circles on the ground. Gu went to urinate and stepped into the circles with both feet. The strong men suddenly came out and dragged them, but the ropes broke and Gu stood still without moving. His foot strength was also amazing.</p>

<h3 id="e236">Desire for Fame <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>I have heard people say that fame is a person's second life. People have a desire to live, so people also have a desire for fame.</p>
<p>Regarding the desire for fame, I should have quoted a few classics, but because I have no research in archeology, I dare not talk nonsense. I might as well talk about reality frankly.</p>
<p>Fame is abstract, like air, like wind, like vocal cords. Its ability to spread is very wide and fast. If you have a reputation in place A, place B and place C will know it in a short time, and then it will spread to the whole county, the whole province, and even the whole world. The so-called (sound vibrates the universe) (famous all over the world) is just that.</p>
<p>Of course, fame is like money. It cannot be obtained by sitting idly. (Seeking fame) means that you have to (seek) it to get it. However, empty seeking is also useless. Otherwise, stealing fame will ultimately be harmful to hearing, and it is not wise to lose one's personality in the pursuit of fame. People who are full all day and do nothing, even if they have a belly full of desire for fame, are also futile. Cooking rice without rice will never produce rice. Fishing without bait will never catch fish. (Behavior) is the bait for catching (fame), which is a matter of course.</p>
<p>Or someone might say, (behavior) seems too general. What kind of (behavior) can catch fame? In fact, this is not a problem. For example, earthworms and red-headed flies can catch fish. (Behavior) can naturally be casual. As the saying goes: (If you can't be famous for a hundred generations, you should be notorious for ten thousand years.) As long as everyone knows that there is such a remarkable figure, that is enough. Good or bad is of course another question. Fragrant is fame, and smelly is also fame.</p>
<p>For example, if you can't save the country, or you don't dare to save the country, then you have to try the means of selling out the country and destroying the country, such as Zheng Xiaoxu and Xi Qia. Although you are indeed guilty in your conscience, you will not attract people's attention if you don't do this. At that time, if someone is scolding, opposing, or even wanting to treat you to a bomb, you don't have to be afraid, and you can't change your attitude. You should understand that at this time, your fame is spreading widely, in newspapers, on walls, and in toilets. Your great name is found everywhere, from domestic to foreign, and the whole world is paying attention. This is the total harvest period of fame.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Rainy Day <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Yi</p>
<p>I really like rainy days. This is my subjective preference, and there is no great significance. I can neither accompany my lover inside a glass window hung with tassels, smoking cigars and enjoying the rain, nor do I have the poetic exuberance of a poet to write poems praising the rain scene; yet I always like rainy days. There was a time when a friend and I were unemployed and living in Shanghai West. We couldn't go out during the day, and we felt even more terrible at night. Fortunately, the window of our small building faced the street. Every day, the two of us leaned on the window sill to look at the window decorations across the street, the cars and trams in the road, and the flower girls on the sidewalk. But later, we were able to close our eyes and clearly imagine these objects, so we hoped for a rainy day to adjust our mental pain. In fact, unemployed people seem to have been deprived of the right to live, and rainy days for us are just the two of us leaning on the window sill to look at the window decorations across the street, the cars and trams in the road, and the flower girls on the sidewalk, but the fine raindrops are really too beautiful a background. However, I cannot describe the beauty of this rainy day. Even if I collect many nice words to describe it, they are still inadequate. Moreover, I think there are many like-minded people among readers. The benefits of this rainy day are only experienced by like-minded people. If others feel disgusted by rainy days, then what I write will be futile.</p>
<p>These days, it has been raining consistently again. Although I am relatively more employed now, I still have a stubborn fondness for rainy days. My office is on the fifth floor of a tall Western-style building. Although my position is also good, it is by the window. However, the best thing is that there are no equally tall Western-style buildings opposite. As far as I can see, I seem to have changed my environment. According to my years of experience in the city, there is certainly no such sublimity, and it is floating with the sudden big and small rain. I seem to be sleepwalking to an unknown scenic spot. In this way, I am often stunned and forget to work.</p>
<p>For the past few days, I have been completely immersed in the beautiful scenery of the rain. I also sat stupidly for two hours on that day off. It is also raining today. When I was holding a pen and thinking blankly, I suddenly felt an unhappy thought, but I couldn't say why. In short, the rain today seems to have lost its inherent beauty. It cannot move my hobby as it used to. However, my love for rainy days will not change.</p>
<p>I thought of the friend who watched the rain with me. A month after I grabbed this job, he was urged to return home by a family letter. On the day of parting, it was such a rainy day. He brought a box of broken books, and I had a burst of hot tears. The two of us separated. Later, he wrote in a letter that he faked the letter to leave because he didn't want to rely on me. He hoped that I would work hard and that we would meet again.</p>
<p>In this way, it has been two years, and there is no news from him. I wonder if he is also watching the rain today... does he also think of and miss his old friend?</p>
<p>I really hope that tomorrow will be a sunny day, otherwise, that unhappy thought will entangle my heart like a snake!</p>
<p>But what is that sound hitting the glass window? I bury my head and dare not look up.</p>

<h3 id="e239">Wild Children <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The autumn wind brought coolness, and the rain was drizzling. There were very few pedestrians on the road, only these few wild children were still wandering in the streets late at night.</p>
<p>(Hey! Where did that kid Xiaomao go?)</p>
<p>Xiao San tightened his pace, approached Ah Yun, and asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>(God knows. That guy Xiaomao has been caught again.)</p>
<p>As soon as Ah Yun finished speaking, everyone laughed. Xiao Heizi said with a smile:</p>
<p>(Xiaomao has been unlucky these past few days. Ah San has come to)</p>
<p>(Make trouble with him.)</p>
<p>The street lights in the deep night looked particularly dim and yellow. The sky was dark and stuffy, like a lead plate pressing down tightly. The few wild children, shrinking their heads and necks, walked further and further away.</p>
<p>At this time, Xiaomao was still squatting alone under the shop porch of a cigarette paper shop in an alley, shrinking his head. The thin and tattered summer cloth shirt on his body was soaked through by the rain and clung tightly to his skin. It was already a bit cool in the autumn night, and he was wearing this dripping shirt, which made the pores on Xiaomao's body stand up one by one, and he shivered more and more coldly.</p>
<p>For the past few days, Xiaomao's luck has been really bad. He couldn't do the business of pulling a cart on the North Sichuan Road Bridge, and the dozens of copper coins he used to sell evening newspapers were all eaten up, so he couldn't even sell the newspapers. Yesterday, he was caught and slapped in the face for nothing. He hasn't had any rice in his stomach for a whole day today, and it just so happened to start raining. In short, Xiaomao's situation of bad luck these past few days was the first time he had encountered it.</p>
<p>At this time, his stomach was full of sullenness, but he couldn't think of a way.</p>
<p>(Isn't that Xiaomao?)</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Several people walked over from that dark place, and one of them shouted loudly. Xiaomao heard it was Xiao Heizi's voice, so he clapped his hands twice in response.</p>
<p>(You guy, I've been looking for you for a long time. Hurry up, there's a business deal over there!)</p>
<p>At this time, Xiaomao was staring blankly at the ground at the few of them. He didn't even bother to listen to Xiao Heizi's words.</p>
<p>(Hey, what are you eating? I'm starving to death. Give me some!)</p>
<p>(Ha, so you're starving. There's plenty to eat, I'm afraid your little belly can't hold it.)</p>
<p>Xiao Heizi said jokingly, but Xiaomao heard that there was something to eat, and his body didn't tremble anymore. He jumped up and grabbed Xiao Heizi.</p>
<p>(Tell me quickly, where is there something to eat? I'll go, I'm really starving to death.)</p>
<p>On the quiet road, Xiaomao and them were walking. Looking at them walking to the corner of Peng Road, Xiao San clapped his hands twice to notify them.</p>
<p>Xiaomao hurried a few steps, approached Xiao San, and grabbed Xiao San with one hand again.</p>
<p>(Hey, what is there to eat? Take it out quickly.)</p>
<p>(There's plenty. If we do the business, we can even buy a new set of clothes to wear.)</p>
<p>(What kind of good business is that? I'll go do it, tell me quickly.)</p>
<p>A group of five or six of them squatted in the dark place at the corner of the road, talking in low voices for a long time. Everyone seemed very happy, and they ran around in the drizzle on the road.</p>
<p>But it is said that Xiaomao and his few wandering friends spent this cold and hungry autumn rainy night living behind iron bars. Their crimes were that they did not engage in proper occupations and repeatedly committed thefts.</p>
<p>Since that night, the North Sichuan Road area has reduced a few wild children wandering in the streets.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Miscellaneous Feelings from the Autumn Window, No. 3 <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>Nostalgia</p>
<p>The traces of autumn linger on the late-ripening grape clusters... linger on the late-blooming chrysanthemum bushes. Chrysanthemums are covered with red gold petals, chrysanthemums are covered with purple gold petals, lying in the warm sunshine, facing the warm sunshine and smiling lightly. Right next to the frame covered with colorful chrysanthemums, I smell the faint fragrance of chrysanthemums and start daydreaming.</p>
<p>In my dream, I deeply taste the aftertaste of lips as sweet as grapes, and listen to private love songs pouring out of a clear throat, pouring out the secrets of young Linlin's heart. Linlin's heart is a secret. Linlin is really a lovable and worrying white swallow! Swallows change with the change of seasons.</p>
<p>Linlin stretched out her hand to pick a red grape and squinted her eyes and said:</p>
<p>Late-blooming grapes have a late-blooming secret taste, the symbol of love!</p>
<p>I chew the secret taste of grapes and the taste of love with the secret taste of grapes! These days, my whole heart, my thoughts, are all resting on Linlin's grape-flavored lips and hair.</p>
<p>A heart immersed in the confusion of love, joyful and worried.</p>
<p>Autumn is the season for falling leaves, and the color of my love has also peeled off the brilliant color.</p>
<p>Swallows change their homes with the change of seasons.</p>
<p>Linlin has indeed become a swallow of the season!</p>
<p>Swallow-like Linlin, where are you flying now? Although there are still grape clusters and chrysanthemum gold petals in her old home, there is no longer the light shadow of Linlin, like a swallow. In the misty drizzle, her old home is shrouded in the deep loneliness of autumn. Lonely old home.</p>
<p>But the old home has had a time when it was not lonely.</p>
<p>But Linlin, the swallow-like Linlin, has abandoned her old home to build her new home. But under the mountain frame are engraved the footprints of past hesitation and the footprints of love.</p>
<p>Linlin, do you have time to recall the past? Will you fly back like a swallow at this time next year?</p>
<p>The heart of Linlin, like a swallow, is as unpredictable as the season of May!</p>
<p>With the rising autumn wind, Linlin suddenly floated south. With one heart. Leaving me behind, but my whole heart, my whole soul, are still entangled in Linlin's grape-flavored lips and hair. I want to wait for Linlin to return to my side, to hear her light throat pour out private love songs, pour out the secrets of young Linlin's heart. Waiting for a longer time.</p>
<p>But I don't know if Linlin will come back after all?</p>
<p>I also understand that all banquets must end, and the past scenes cannot be chased back, just as the raindrops that fall on the ground cannot be called to fly back to the sky. Only because the emotion Linlin gave me was too intense, my whole life was greatly shaken, and I couldn't calm down no matter what.</p>
<p>Every day, from morning to night, I stand in front of the window like a lost soul, looking at the green sky. Waiting for Linlin, like a swallow, to fly down from the sky.</p>
<p>With my twenty-one years of depressed heart.</p>
<p>But when will Linlin come back? Will she come back?</p>
<h3 id="e241">Bowing in Distress <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Zhi</p>
<p>(The poor are overly harsh, they look at the world with different eyes.)</p>
<p>— Dostoevsky, "The Poor")</p>
<p>In the morning, I wiped my hazy eyes with a face cloth dipped in cold water, put on my old coat, and quickly reached into my outer pocket to count the remaining coins... one, two, three, four... I didn't dare to think too much. Today I have to live on less than ten copper coins.</p>
<p>When I went out, my eyes were hazy, and I carelessly discarded the happy dream, letting my consciousness be crushed by the iron wheels of reality, like a car crushing the road. I raised my head and looked at the straight chimneys on the top of the factory, the tram lines. When the tram passed by, the electric poles on the top of the car rubbed out green sparks at the joints of the lines, which flew and then disappeared silently.</p>
<p>(—The sparks of life's conflicts!)</p>
<p>Yes, the sparks of life's conflicts also explode and then disappear silently.</p>
<p>The copper coins in the bag started to sound again, and then my whole body started to tremble, a slight, empty, soft feeling. Experience flashed like lightning, is hunger! Hunger devouring people like a beast!</p>
<p>Thinking about it, it's ridiculous. Why does anyone need to know? In this world, the top knows, but people can't know people. If the world is a mystery, then although one may be disappointed in solving it, at least one can say that one has learned something from that soft feeling like a beast. People who have been hungry are not surprised at all by the abundant food placed in the display cabinets of food stores. When a person with an empty stomach keeps looking outside, he can't help but think... why can't I take it and eat it? Why is there a layer of glass in between? What is this layer of glass?</p>
<p>(And a thin layer of glass represents... a terrible force, human selfishness.)</p>
<p>The world is wearing a coat of glass.</p>
<p>And I feel that this layer of glass, it is powerful; it inherently contains an irrationality, a contradiction, a tragedy, the great tragedy of mankind.</p>
<p>Confused... then what does the world represent? Isn't it completely irrational?</p>
<p>It is not to say that a person who is starving is somewhat cruel, he has the courage to obliterate all the good intentions of (people); but this is not very justifiable, there are some people in the world who are as (ruthless) as iron, they treat suffering as a universal library, they learn everything from suffering, they look at the world with a different eye.</p>
<p>Looking at the crisscrossing buildings, looking at the clouds in the sky, looking at all the property that is less than ten copper coins, cruelly, calmly, and blankly.</p>
<p>The feeling is feverish, soft.</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Dinner was ready. Xu Zhai's family was quite traditional, at least in the sense that men and women were separate; for example, the women could only eat in the kitchen, while in the main hall, the three brothers plus Shi Min each occupied a corner, making exactly four people.</p>
<p>Country life was usually very frugal. Except for the first and fifteenth of the month, there was rarely any meat on the table. Moreover, Old Master Zhengfu's family precepts were very strict, always emphasizing thrift. Today was already special because it was the second uncle's first day back home, so there was a bowl of fried eggs, which was already quite lavish; Shi Min knew this very well.</p>
<p>Zhi Zhai rarely spoke during meals. However, it wasn't that he didn't want to, but rather that he was preoccupied... regretting not writing a letter a couple of days earlier, so his wife didn't know he was back and was still enjoying herself at her parents' house. He would undoubtedly have to sleep alone tonight, and tomorrow morning, he would definitely visit his in-laws. But he was also worried that it might rain tomorrow; with tonight being so warm, the weather tomorrow was likely unreliable.</p>
<p>After a while, he had already eaten a bowl and a half of rice, and he remained silent, not saying a word. However, for some reason, the eldest and third brothers began to argue. He overheard them arguing about how remarkable and good Li Yuanhong's men were, while the eldest brother didn't think much of Li Yuanhong, arguing that since he had accepted the imperial salary, he should have been loyal to the country and shouldn't have joined the revolutionaries to start a rebellion. If he wasn't loyal to the Qing court, how could he be loyal to the Republic? As for Sun Wen and Huang Xing, they were a different matter because they didn't accept the imperial salary and devoted themselves to the revolution. Their greatness lay in this. Later, the eldest brother even presented evidence, saying...</p>
<p>"I won't talk about other things, just his recent proclamation... forbidding the private sheltering of officials, the infringement of commerce, and the killing of fellow countrymen, all of which are good. But he forbids harming foreigners and attacking foreign volunteer corps. How afraid of death is he!"</p>

<p>Spring silkworms raised, autumn silkworms busy. Many young village women gather mulberry leaves. Farmers only seek to make ends meet. Farm women toil day and night, forgetting sleep and food. Lamps burn all night without rest. They eat only yellow rice, salted greens, and bean curd soup. Wet leaves are gathered and must be wiped dry. In the cold of spring, rice containers are filled. If a spring thunder sounds, the frightened silkworm woman worries and cries to heaven. Therefore, raising silkworms and making cocoons is not easy. It takes hard work and mental strain to fill their bellies. In recent years, Chinese silk merchants have suffered a blow. Mostly because of enemy countries' conspiracies and hidden arrows. It is hateful that unscrupulous silk merchants use artificial goods. Therefore, domestic silk has been harmed. It is hoped that the government will invent scientific instruments. To save sericulture, improvements are needed. Know that it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost. The silk merchants should rouse their spirits. Furthermore, I urge the national sericulture guidance centers. To persuade the farms to do their best to help. Manufacturing plants must strive for selection. Competing with silkworm cocoons can revitalize the country. Only then can Greater China's industry be forever boundless.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Radio Drama Society, one of the most famous broadcasting drama troupes in Shanghai, has been established for several months. It has broadcast radio dramas on major radio stations in the city. The drama materials taken by the society are of pure and noble meaning, and most of them focus on the future of the nation and the survival of the country. Therefore, it has been warmly praised by the audience. In particular, the clear and fluent Mandarin dialogue of the members of the society is most praised. Shanghai Sound Film Company in this city has long admired its name, and specially sent personnel to discuss with Mr. Liu Hengzhi, the founder of the society, and invited Ms. Yan Fei, Xing Shu, and gentlemen such as Xu Jingsheng and Gao Mangsheng to produce sound films. It is heard that the consent of all has been obtained. From the first day of this month, the broadcast programs of each radio station will be temporarily suspended, and all the spirits will be devoted to the screen work. Once the film is completed, it will continue to be broadcast. Hope the audience pays attention.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that Huaxing Radio Station in this city is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony on the 6th of this month. It specially invited the Shanghai Radio Drama Society to perform a special program. The society really could not refuse the kind invitation, and will broadcast the radio drama "Wu Song Kills His Sister-in-Law" on the radio station from 1 o'clock that night.</p>

<p>— Jia Bin</p>
<p>Driven by the trend of the times, although Chinese-made films have not yet reached the peak of artistic expression in form, they have been recognized as public education, and there are indeed many people who are vocally advocating cultural movements in films. Indeed, film always advances like a pioneer on the cultural foundation of a country. However, this mission cannot be shouldered by the numerous crudely made and shoddy film works. Frankly speaking, Chinese films still have a lot of bad and boring things. Not only do they lack content, but they also lack the skills of artistic expression. Talking about culture, isn't it an easy thing in Chinese films? But finally, someone has come out and has to do a cultural movement on this.</p>
<p>If film is truly film, I always acknowledge it as a pioneer of the times, symbolizing real life and promoting cultural evolution... In essence, it is not a tool of social education but a leader of social education. In form, it integrates various departments of art and strives to express (strength) and (beauty). (Strength) and (beauty) are not only indispensable basic conditions for film art, but also the most needed substance in the form and behavior of life. For example, we say that the more civilized the brain, the more barbaric the body. The so-called more barbaric body means that (strength) is its main component. As for (beauty), (modern beauty), health is essential for success.</p>
<p>Because of this, I have something I must say (physical fitness on the silver screen).</p>
<p>Physical fitness has indeed been a fashionable term in recent years. But in films, I have rarely seen anyone advocate this practical physical fitness movement. Perhaps some people will think of women's legs when they see the two words "physical fitness." In fact, what crime do their legs have! It's just that opinions differ.</p>
<p>It seems to be a common opinion many years ago... (The Lin Daiyu-style sickly beauty is no longer suitable as the (beauty) standard for Chinese women... Physical soundness is the standard of modern female beauty. Because according to the theory of eugenics, to restore the declining national strength, the health of motherhood is an urgent matter,) At that time, in fact, along with this argument, there were also various behaviors of women harming their own bodies in this contradictory society. The bad habit of breast binding has not been eradicated. Fortunately, the environment of life is constantly changing, perhaps because of the continuous advancement of culture, this bad habit will soon disappear without a trace. However, women's health is ultimately a slow process of progress. At present, there are still many women with Lin Daiyu-style sickly beauty parasitizing in society. Even if we sometimes see those deformed curves in the ballroom, although they don't bind their breasts, it is definitely not a manifestation of physical fitness. Moreover, they are very, very far from physical fitness. Because they are always too weak to withstand the wind.</p>
<p>Gentlemen who make films, I hope you pay correct attention to (physical fitness on the silver screen).</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e249">Review of (The Soul of Beauty) — Central <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>It is said that this is an old work from a few years ago, but in general, it is a work worth watching.</p>
<p>However, strictly criticizing it, the director is using old methods to capture the audience due to the provisions of the script. Regarding this aspect, we can cite a point to explain the facts.</p>
<p>Xu Qinfang, feeling indignant due to the humiliation and the sadness of her father's death, jumps off a cliff to commit suicide. He Zhigang and Zheng Junli chase after her. On the mountain, in the forest, and by the cliff, it builds up to a climax. The appropriate and adequate editing makes this scene quite tense. However, the running back and forth and the fact that she is rescued just as she jumps down are inevitably very old-fashioned.</p>
<p>Another example is the last scene, the engagement of Xu Qinfang and He Zhigang. Xu Qinfang certainly does it very delicately, and the director's handling of the mood is also commendable. However, using Xu Qinfang's refusal to eat the pear that He Zhigang shared with her to show that she does not want to separate, and using two entangled velvet ropes to symbolize their love threads, is relatively difficult for most people to understand, and it is not a new method.</p>
<p>Of course, most of the above are the responsibility of the screenwriter. The director's full expression of what is contained in the play is naturally the minimum fulfillment of his own duty. However, a successful director should make up for the shortcomings of the script. For example, in the home of He Zhigang, the young master, since there is such a big house and such a big garden, why is there only one master and one servant? This is a shortcoming of the script, and the director should at least add a few more servants to make the family lively. Otherwise, this family is too exaggerated.</p>
<p>Indeed, the script has many shortcomings. Perhaps some people say that this script is at least very tortuous and bizarre. However, this is very far-fetched. If there were no chance encounters while eating in the Western restaurant, in the mountain house, and several times in the park, then this story simply could not have been strung together. (Why coincidences cannot be used in films does not need to be explained here.) It was enough for Xu Qinfang to suddenly cover for someone at Jiang Youyi's house, but it is simply impossible to justify her enduring humiliation at Shang Guanwu's house for the second time and stubbornly refusing to reveal his secret. Furthermore, in terms of the development of the characters' personalities, it is very inappropriate for Xu Qinfang to transform from a daughter guarding a tower to a modern girl. As for Gu Xiaohu going to Luoxing Street with a big black bow tie, how unreasonable is that? On the contrary, he said that Zheng Junli wearing a suit would easily attract the attention of the villains... These places should be the director's responsibility.</p>
<p>No, our review of the script does not stop there. More importantly, we must point out that if this is a detective film, then this story does not focus on the scientific solving of the detective case. On the contrary, if there were no several chance encounters, the case could not be revealed, and a lot of effort was made in other aspects. Therefore, rather than a detective film, it is better to say that it is an ordinary so-called love film.</p>
<p>As for the theme of the play, it is even more vague. Exposing the ugly state of the private lives of gentlemen is not the theme, so is it about plotting money and harming people? Then how ordinary and vulgar is that. The detective films produced by Warner, such as (New York Express), are worth learning from for playwrights.</p>
<p>The actors are all passable, but the makeup is slightly worse. Zhou Damin's photography is passable, at least the camera angles show effort.</p>
<p>An unprecedentedly great and tragic historical drama of the Mexican Revolution, the immortal work of Juarez Peel's life. (Long Live Freedom) One scene from within—Nanjing will screen it soon.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e250">Postscript After Watching (Fragrant Snow Sea) <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>(Fragrant Snow Sea) is indeed different from other films, with a unique and quiet interest. What is depicted inside is not the sin of the city, nor is it modern love, but a unique and pure folk sentiment, a real scene from a previous era, attacking the remnants of reality left over by the skillful technique. The novelty of its material and the depth of its meaning are indeed beyond ordinary imagination.</p>
<p>Regarding the selection of materials, the film takes the life of a village woman as the theme. She has gone through many hardships, joys and sorrows. Because she is deeply poisoned by superstition, she deeply believes that God is omnipotent, and asks God for all her difficulties. Coincidentally, superstition has given her everything, but also lost everything because after everything is fulfilled as she wishes, she fulfills her vow and becomes a nun. Of course, her heart is very painful. Later, after all, moved by the maternal nature, after her son looked for her and was injured, she still returned home to live a life of happiness in suffering.</p>
<p>As far as the actors are concerned, no one is working hard. Not only is the protagonist effective, but none of the supporting roles are mismatched. It is true that everyone is suitable for their own identity and personality. Of course, this is the joint effort of the director and the actors to achieve this perfect result. Especially the child star Li Keng, how touching his expression is, and even gives the audience a deep impression.</p>
<p>In terms of subtitles, many places use especially clever and humorous language. You only need to carefully savor it to know its magic. At the same time, it also uses symbolic and audible expressions, which can be said to be meticulous.</p>
<p>After the first act, the last act follows closely, recalling her life in the nunnery. This kind of editing is special and is the first of its kind in Chinese films.</p>
<p>In this film, the knocking of the wooden fish and the blacksmithing in (Life) I think have the same effect.</p>
<p>(Life) has already had considerable honor in society. I can predict that this film will certainly not fall behind (Life), maybe it will be ahead of (Life), because it is much more advanced than (Life)! (Respectful Reward)</p>

<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>Ban Zhuo was instructing Sykes on how to write news for him, but Ferro suddenly refused. He said... "Wait a minute, I am the mastermind. You write my name in it." Ban Zhuo scolded angrily... "Get out! You don't need to care about him. You write about me first." Ferro heard this, pulled out his gun, pointed at Sykes and said... "You obediently write my name in it"! Ban Zhuo also pulled out his gun and roared... "Do Americans need to know what Ferro did? Bastard." Ferro shouted loudly... "Who killed the chief judge and his friend? It was me!" Ban Zhuo said... "What does that matter. Without my order?" Sykes persuaded while afraid, pushing the muzzles of the two bandit leaders away from his head. Just as they were arguing and unable to resolve it, a bandit ran in like a whirlwind and shouted... "Ban Zhuo! Go quickly! The two brigades have already arrived! Hurry!" Ban Zhuo quickly walked to the door, looked around, and saw that a brigade of cavalry had already arrived in the town. His men had all jumped on their horses, firing their guns randomly, hitting the glass windows on both sides of the street, and then whipping their horses and fleeing. Ban Zhuo turned his head and shouted at Sykes... "Let's go! Come with me!" Sykes said... "No, I still have to send a telegram." Ban Zhuo said... "It doesn't matter, we can find another telegraph office." Sykes still refused to go. But Ban Zhuo pulled him to the door, gently embraced him, put him on the horse and galloped away.</p>
<p>Ban Zhuo had only gone a short distance when he saw a photography studio by the roadside with the words "Gavedo Special Photography" written on the signboard. Ban Zhuo saw it, reined in his horse, and jumped down. Ferro was so frightened that he asked him what he was doing. He said I want to see a friend, an artist. Sykes said... "They are all catching up." Ban Zhuo said... "It doesn't matter." He took Ferro, Thomas and Sykes and a group of people and walked into the photography studio. Gavado was a small man. When he saw Ban Zhuo, he shouted... "Hey, Ban Zhuo, do you still have time to take pictures now?" Ban Zhuo said... "I don't want to take pictures. I want you to write a letter for me. Do you know that woman called Sister Lucy? I want to marry her as my wife. You write a letter for me, saying that I will go to her tonight." Sykes said in surprise... "Are you getting married?" Ferro interjected... "He likes to get married the most. He gets married every two or three days." Ban Zhuo said... "I am like this by nature, almost religious. Gavado, you tell Lucida that I am going to her house tonight, around eleven o'clock. Tell her to prepare. Everything should be good." Gavado started writing the letter. As he wrote, he read... "My glorious queen... my little dove..." Ferro was standing by the window, watching the central army cavalry pass by. He took out his gun and muttered... "I can hit three of them at once." Sykes quickly shouted at him not to shoot. At this time, Gavado's letter was almost written, and Ban Zhuo still wanted him to draw something nice on the letter. Gavado said... "Okay. What do you like to draw? Two doves kissing each other?" Ban Zhuo said... "I think doves are not good. Draw something like me. A cow." Gavado said... "No, no. It's not good to draw that thing on a letter. I'll draw a heart for you, pierced by an arrow..." Ban Zhuo said... "No. You draw a cow for me. You listen to me." Gavado refused. Ban Zhuo grabbed him and pointed at him fiercely and said... "Will you draw it or not?" Gavado shouted... "You can kill me. I just won't draw a cow! I won't draw a cow"! Ban Zhuo really took out his gun. He gritted his teeth and said... "I order you! You draw a cow for me"! Gavado had no choice but to agree. But when he finished drawing, Ban Zhuo picked up the paper and looked at it, and it was still two doves kissing each other. Ban Zhuo wanted to raise his gun and fire, but Sykes stopped him. At this time, the central army had surrounded the place, Ban Zhuo said to Gavado... "Gavado, you come with us. I like art the most." As he said this, he tied up Gavado in the same way he tied up Sykes. (To be continued)</p>
