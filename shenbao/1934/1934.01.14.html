<h3>克服福州後　元</h3>
<p>此次征閩之役。克延平。取古田。收復厦門。今且有海軍攻克福州之說。是否確實。雖待證明。其期當亦不遠。惟福州攻克之後。軍事將就此吿一段落乎。抑將乘勝進展以壓平全省之閩軍乎。以吾人測之。軍事或可吿一段落。何以故。以此次用兵閩省。與其他内戰不同。所謂不得已也。不得已之用兵。祇求其使之懾服而止。所謂哀矜勿喜。非若其他爭城奪地之戰爭。克一城得一地。卽以顯示我武力之强誇耀我武功之盛乘勝進取必盡如我所欲而後止也閩變之初十九路軍狃於一二八之役以爲必可僥倖一逞今旣受此重大之打擊。以常情論。自必知所覺悟。而生自悔之心。中央於此。正宜適可而止。予彼以悔禍之機會。而勿爲窮寇之追。蓋用兵旣出於不得已則除用兵外。苟有方法可以解决之者。則自當於其他之方法求之。且軍事而外。關於政事問題之糾紛正多。而决不能一一以兵力解决之。故征閩之役。必以武力始而以和平終也。抑吾更有言者。此次閩變之爆發。不過諸問題中之一問題耳。中央於此閩變一問題。苟能處置適當。自可減少其他不滿中央者鬱忿不平之氣勢。吾爲此言。非謂中央此次武力之勝利。足以懾服之也。謂中央能乘此解决閩事之機會。以實行其向所表示精神團結事事公開之言。報載中央要人對於西南主張及胡漢民氏八條之建議。恒有盡量允納之表示。若當局果於此閩事吿一段落之際。誠意以所欲公開之方法。澈底表示。使各方明白政府不私一黨。而確有延攬黨外人才之意。則其成功必較閩變甫發時爲易。此又何以故。以在閩變甫發時而言合作。而言精神團結。人將疑中央迫於無辦法而出此。未必眞有合作團結之誠意。迨福州克復之後。人又將疑中央以武力勝利之故。必幡然一變其面目。取消從前團結合作之意。而仍代以專斷之態度。此種推測。雖近於以小人之腹度君子之心。然亦尙在一般普通人情理之中。今中央果能於武力勝利之後。表示用兵之出於不得已。而急速以和平方法。收拾閩局。毋使糾紛延長。人民多受戰禍之苦痛。一方卽本誠意合作團結之初衷。以與西南剴切商求救國方針。公開路逕。以示大公無我之道。如此則人之前疑中央無辦法而始言合作團結者。固可消釋。而後之疑中央恃勝而驕又將專尙武力者。亦可渙然氷釋矣。此我所以謂爲成功之較易也。</p>
<p>嗚呼。國事艱難。至此已極。操持政柄之人。一念之轉。一心之動。通乎全國墨索里尼希特勒諸人。所以能艱苦卓絶。應付世變者。亦恃其誠懇之心念。有以激動其全國人民。使趨於精神上之團結一致。世界未有國内不一致而能對外者也。亦未有專恃武力而能齊一其國内者也。我政府於此四全大會將開之際。其速急起而圖之。</p>

<p>蘇俄與美國外交關係之恢復、開一互相合作之途徑、在政治上經濟上均最堪欣幸、蘇俄能多多輸入外貨、但若無力付價、則不願發給定單、故吾人不願一方不能輸出吾人之貨、而另一方輸入外國之貨、吾人將不終止付給、如若于他國然、有人謂蘇俄無付給能力、斯實大誤、因吾人從未嘗中止付給故、</p>
<p>吾人最殷切願望與日本維持友誼、但此事吾人不能獨爲之、祗要日本對蘇俄採取友誼的政策、則兩國間之合作不成問題、特吾人深慮日本之軍閥將反對友誼的政策、斯乃兩國間最大危機之所在、</p>
<p>危機之來、非吾人所願、而吾人不能不凖備應付、凡國家暴露於危險、其政府不設法自衛、則必爲國民所棄、日本若襲擊吾人、吾人殊不覺其爲智、日本經濟情形不甚優惠、彼有「滿洲國」及中國爲其隣、然一旦與蘇俄開戰、何國將爲其後援耶、一個好軍人不恒爲一個好經濟學家也、</p>
<p>吾人預期將終能與英國締結一商約、但在現狀下、能否早締、乃一疑問、</p>
<p>意大利對於國際聯盟之改組、並未對吾人有任何提議、</p>
<p>蘇俄目下之最大問題、爲改善其供給商品於城村之制度、增進其交通系尤其鐵路、此等問題解决非易但吾人旣能征服更大之困難於前、深信終能解决此等困難於後、工業化之問題現經解决、集團農業之難題並經解决、其尙待解决之問題、祗餘改善供給商品制度及交通制度之兩項而已、（世界社）</p>

<h3>魯省韓主席將邀滬各業領袖徵詢意見興發實業礦商合組大公司廳長張鴻烈將來滬商建設</h3>
<p>錢承緒氏、去歲應山東省府韓主席之招、對於興發該省實業諸問題、爲私人方面相互間之研討、錢君所具計劃、除煤產統制一端、已由山東省府及靑島市府採擇、會同着手進行外、尙有建設棉麥倉庫·及改良棉種諸問題、省府亦認爲異常重要、正在規劃、不久將有辦法公布、錢君於日前返滬後、新聲社記者、曾往晤見據談如下、</p>
<h3>統制煤業</h3>
<p>予（錢自稱）此次之行、目光所及、山東政治已上軌道、進而達於建設時期、予所條陳有二、第一爲煤之統制、主張採用分產合銷政策、由商人自組公司、提高煤價與品質、同時限制產量、以銷滅同業競爭、以統一國煤陣綫、關於此節、因於煤之出口·煤之市塲·均有牽動各方面利益之趨勢、故省市兩府所採步驟、極爲穏定、討論之時間亦最長、最後、兩府意見已趨一致、各派代表會同靑濟煤礦商、至膠濟鐵路沿綫博山·淄川·等地、召集當地礦商、進一步爲組織上之討論、已有成立公司之可能、因刻下官廳方面督促甚嚴、山東建設廳長張鴻烈、並已向商方表示、如無辦法、政府决不旁觀、而靑島市長沈鴻烈、更已限定時期、商方非於廢歷年前成立公司籌備處不可、</p>
<h3>棉麥倉庫</h3>
<p>其次、卽爲建設棉麥倉庫、予主張採用坎拿大麥庫信託組織、集中全省農產、於適當地域、建築大規模之庫棧、發行流動倉庫券、藉以抬高物價調節金融、其所得之結果、所有一切不活動之物品、可以慨變現金、流通鄕間、農民自得依賴乎物品之擔保、而獲得經濟上之活動、查山東全省所有各種農產、可供擔保發行庫券之數量、約略估計、至少有一萬萬元之票面可以發行、以之救濟農村、卽無異加增一萬萬元之流動資本、此事有關於復興農村、問題至爲重大、省府對此、尙在愼重考慮中、予日來亦正在搜集此類組織之各種資料、期於短時期内草就具體計劃、以利推進、</p>
<h3>物產豐富</h3>
<p>予在靑濟兩地、勾留時間無多、對於其他問題、未暇顧問但依予觀察所得、山東物產豐富、地勢優越、在在適合於外界之投資、第、一水陸交通便利、運輸不感困難、第二、地雖處南北中心、而並非軍事地帶、第三、所有物產、如煤棉麥烟葉花生等等、均爲工業製造之動力上及原料上所必需物品、從事推廣與開發、足供全國數十年之需、他如濰縣等地、原料用之不竭、尤宜於棉紡捲菸等工業、第四、山東重要商埠、金融機關設立至多、創辦實業、金融調度、不感枯窘、此僅言經濟、至言政治、則山東於最近兩年來、於韓復榘主席治理之下、所有經費、用於建設事業者、每年達數百萬元、而庫有餘存、民有蓋藏、所謂農村破產、於他處容或有之、在山東則尙未見有破產徵象之表現也、</p>
<h3>力謀建設</h3>
<p>省府建設廳爲推動各種建設事業之總樞紐、廳長張鴻烈、係美國留學生、對於各種組織、均感興奮、瀕行語予、謂世界經濟風雲、瞬息萬變、處茲複雜社會、做事非憑一人一国所可有爲、故今春將定期來申、專訪各業領袖、磋商山東以後各種事業建設之基本方案、而韓主席對於復興山東產業之志願、亦異常殷切、不久將柬邀滬地各業領袖、專程去魯、除游覽各地山水以外、並擬徵詢各人意見、以資借鏡、</p>
<h3>各法團代表赴法領署要求負責索回金晳呈請市政府繼續嚴重交涉</h3>
<p>金晳爲日領非法逮捕後、本市商會·敎育會·律師公會·大學生聯合會·農會·納稅華人會·特區市民聯合會·等發起組織金案後援會、公推代表、於昨日赴市府、請求向法日總領事署嚴重抗議、繼復相偕赴法領署、適時在午餐之際、未得與梅總領事相見、乃留簡單書面、稱、金晳由貴領署恊同日警、非法逮捕、現依據歸化中國國籍、及租界司法恊定兩點、應請法領署負責索回、幷在本案交涉未解、先應請貴領署嚴重制止逕解日本、是爲至要云云、茲將各法團聯呈市政府原文照錄于後、呈爲金晳非法被捕、請求向法日總領事署、嚴重抗議事、竊歸化中華民國國民金晳、於民國廿二年十一月廿二日、被法中央巡捕房恊同日領事署、非法逮捕、迭經交涉、迄未釋回、查金晳旣爲中華民國國民、按照國家最高主權之行使、絶不容任何國家之干涉、此次日領署妄加捕逮、法領署不問事實、遽予恊助、顯屬侵犯我國主權、且于逮捕後不移付中國法院訊問、逕行解交尤屬違反租界恊定、危害住民安全、若不繼續嚴重交涉、不特國家威信掃地、而於未來歸國籍之交涉、後此創爲惡例、具呈人等均係居住上海、對此問題利害、尤爲關切、羣情憤慨、殊難緘默、除籌備組織金案後援會、澈底抗爭外、敢請鈞府察核、迅予向法日領署繼續嚴重抗議、以維主權、實爲公便、謹呈上海市政府、</p>
<h3>認購美麵麥廠商提辦法六項</h3>
<p>昨晨呈請財政部核准</p>
<p>一俟批准免稅卽解决</p>
<p>本市麵粉廠商、自財政部公佈征收洋米麥新稅率後、曾迭次聯合各地廠商、派代表向政府當局請願、要求免征未公佈前所定購之洋麥粉稅、雖未獲當局遽允然該廠商以此次所定之粉麥、爲數殊鉅、如不堅請减輕稅率　其損失實不堪負担、是以一再向財部當局洽商、現已漸有進展、新新社記者、昨晨向關係方面探悉、財部當局、已向該業廠商提出通融辦法、卽廠商須認購美麥二十四萬噸、美粉六百四十萬包、（約値美金四百萬元）廠商方面業已允可、並於昨晨將提貨辦法、繕呈財部駐滬辦事處、請求核准、其辦法大致爲下列數點、（一）美麥二十四萬噸、分五個月來華、其價値分三次結算、以中外市情爲標凖、（二）美麥成分、計硬冬三成、二號美白麥七成、（三）美粉六百四十萬包、分十二個月來華、（四）該粉除人馬·福壽·黃金錢·紅日當天·四種外、其他牌子之粉質、須與上項四種相同、（五）進口稅依照减讓百分之五計算、（六）運往外洋及東三省之貨品、請政府實行退還麥稅、以上辦法、如經財部核准、該廠商卽可承購、至要求免稅案、亦可因此解决云、</p>
<h3>鐵部劃一聯運貨物運價計算方法</h3>
<p>計算加價及負責費等</p>
<p>應按照運費加成標凖</p>
<p>鐵道部爲劃一聯運貨物運價計算方法事、昨特訓令兩路管理局云、查國有各貨物聯運、業於上年十一月恢復、所有計算運費方法、亟應有劃一之規定、以利貨商而昭公允、溯自二十一年九月、津浦京滬滬杭甬三路實行負責聯運之初、所有負責優先最優先等費及加價、均係按負責運輸通則第四十條之規定、照普通貨物單位運價分别加成、其總數、再以重量乘之、卽爲總運費、故該三路原有負責貨物聯運價目表、係將普通運價加價及負責等費、各按單位計算、分别印列、迨至上年十一月恢復國内聯運之時、本部以時間促迫、</p>
<h3>彙編運價</h3>
<p>一時趕編不及、因飭由各路先行交換運價表使用、一面按照部頒聯運價表格式、塡造報部、以便彙編、並於第七三二三號訓令公布聯運　運價計算方法、俾資遵照各在案、現各路所塡運價表、多已寄到、本部正在趕編各路聯運運價表彙編中、惟以前津浦·京滬·滬杭甬·三路、對於加價及負責費等、係按運價加成計算、而第七三二三號訓令所規定之臨時辦法、則係按運費加成計算再核各路貨票、亦有按運價加成者、有按運費加成者、辦法旣不統一、運費自有差異、殊非公允之道、茲經細加研究結果、所有加價及負責費等、均以按照運費加成計算手續上較爲簡便、理論上較爲公平、嗣後</p>
<h3>各路計算</h3>
<p>加價及負責費等時、應按運費加成、卽計算聯運貨物運費時、應以彙編所載每五十公斤或每公噸之運價、乘每批託運貨物之重量、得每批貨物之運價總數、此項總數、卽作爲加價及負責費等加成之標凖、上項計算運費辦法不惟各路員司計算較爲簡便而聯運運價彙編亦可祗列運價一項、所有加價及負責費等、均勿庸分别計算列入、篇幅較前縮小、印刷費用較前减少、應用時亦較爲便利、故本部此次所編之聯運運價表彙編、祗列運價、不列其他加價及負責費等、一俟編印就緒、當卽分發應用、運費</p>
<h3>厘位取捨</h3>

<p>船隻阻停　從老垃圾橋上向東西兩頭觀望、河内盡是船舶、幾不見水面、而舟子之擠軋排擋擾攘爭吵之聲、更充斥於耳、在阻斷處之河内、縱橫水面之船隻、行人可以在河中跨舟步行、不須涉水而渡、自西阻東、被塞阻之小輪·民船·駁船·航船·及　　船·等大小不一、足有一二千隻、廷綿有一二里之長、</p>
<p>水警排疏　昨日、水巡捕房已經派出巡船及長警等至蘇州河内設法排疏阻斷之水道、使交通恢復、但一時軋停在中段者、殊無法進退、自晨至午、水巡捕雖極力疏導、而猶未能通行、現聞已從東西兩頭令各船退出、大致今日可疏通、亦未可知、</p>
<p>航輪影響　因河道塞斷、而各處小輪之不能開行者甚多、其較大之内河輪船、有班期關係者、多臨時改繞外江行駛、則較内河爲遠、其中最受損失者爲一般由内地裝貨來滬求售之貨客船、被阻在内、不能開進、而載貨離滬者、亦有不少、無法出河、其損失則至爲巨大、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<p>關於選擇學習科&gt;[P</p>
<p>目的幾個問題（續）</p>
<p>在許多聲請書中，一人常常開着他要研究三四種科目，甚至五六種以至再多的科目。如旣欲習文學，又欲習科學以及其他各科目如建築學汽車學之類。同時兼習幾種科目，是否衝突及使效率减少，這個問題因尙待討論，但因時間有限，若同時習數科目，結果必定是顧此失彼，一無所成，我們却敢斷言。關於這一點，邵國權君的來信詢問就是一個證明：「……所幸所中之工作時間甚少，每日平均只有五小時……所以我就在貴報夜校攻讀英文，並在某社讀國文。但一學期來，因讀了兩種功課，似乎在精神上受了牽制，致毫無進步，講到我的個性，對於國文與英文都同樣歡喜，尤以在職業方面亦同樣需要着。先生，照這樣的境况，還是去其一呢？抑兩種繼續並進呢？」我們對於邵君的答覆是：「足下兼讀旣感困難，則與其勉强繼續，顧此失彼，毋寗專讀一門，多得進益。」像邵君有這樣多空閒的人尙如此感覺到困難，兼讀的害處可想而知。所以我們希望參加者，如同時喜歡學數種科目，最好先就最喜歡的最需要巽一樣。</p>
<p>治學必需以通曉語言爲前提，這是事實，尤其是在中國，因爲文化落後，研究科學必須讀外國書，因此，習學外國語遂成了今日學校的主要科目，讀書的先决問題。但是習學一種外國語，起碼要用二三年的時間，並且就是如此，恐怕也未必能精通。因此習學外國語雖極必要，但也需看看自已的學習環境。所以，許多參加者爲了欲讀社會科學或自然科學的原故，擬習讀外國語，關於這，我們以爲必先解决兩個先决問題卽（一）是否有充分時間（二）是爲專門研究或是僅求常識。如果是僅求普通常識而且無充分時間，則習學外國語大可不必。因爲如因習外國語而多費時間，而結果外國語並未精通，所欲讀的科目更一無所得，是最不經濟的一件事。而且，這問題又可分兩方面講，中國近來社會科學似乎要較自然科學發達些，著譯的書報在數量上亦頗多，足够我們僅要了解實際生活的人的研求。</p>
<p>我們在冩這篇文字時，又接得余萬望君來信，他提出「自然科學與社會科學孰重？」的問題，這問題我們有許多話要說，在明日另作討論，這裏暫且按下不提。</p>
<p>總之∶我們雖則對於讀者的讀書環境有相當的了解，我們却不能直接了當的硬讓讀者習學某種科目，我們祇能按照他們的生活環境，建議在他們的生活情形之下，如何便會使所讀的書有益，不致徒勞無功，不跑寃枉的路。至於究竟要選擇什麽科目讀，則仍應由讀者提出「讀書計畫」，不過，我們却願居於旁觀者的地位，對於所提出的計畫，作一番商酌，稍盡一點「識途老馬」的責任。</p>

<h3>棒球塲四座歡騰東華再克華塞斯1-2雙方藝術佳妙表演精彩勝利焦點端賴射擊準確西捕一比二敗法商</h3>
<p>西聯甲組賽中、東華前曾以二對一擊敗華塞斯、論者謂華塞斯當時作戰僅十人、其敗固宜、昨日下午兩隊又作第二次西聯甲組賽於棒球塲、在五千觀衆視綫下、大戰九十分鐘、結果東華仍以同樣二對一之比數、再敗華塞斯、雄視滬濱之華塞斯、至時亦有甘心拜服、祗得垂頭喪氣、收拾殘兵而去、</p>
<h3>蓄意圖强威名恢復</h3>
<p>東華自上週受挫於曁南、威名大損、主其事者、邀集全體、羣議善後、爲欲力圖中興、端賴整理隊伍、誓師之後、果然日加操練、兵力旣壯、精神益旺、勁敵如華塞斯、亦遭敗挫、長此以往、是當括目以視東華矣、顧論當日局勢、前鋒奔跑傳遞、敵方見長内部防守抵禦、東華較穏、兩方勝負得失之焦點、在乎善於射擊人才之多寡、英兵得阿巧一人、東華有戴李兩將、時機一至、結局遂異、</p>
<h3>運佑出塲氣象一新</h3>
<p>最近東華之失利、由於全軍疏懈之故、而中堅馮運佑因病缺席、亦爲此中全因之一、昨日馮君登塲應戰、雖在病後力弱之餘、依然奮發有爲、與諸英雄一致努力、加以屠開元吳幼良表演驚人、中衛綫乃覺生氣勃然、周賢言李寗關洵安三人、技藝超羣、婦孺皆曉、萬象華與賈幼良各有佳妙傳中、勝利之兩球、萬賈均負相當功績、戴麟經乃首先立功之人、而判决勝負命運者爲李義臣、二人射擊準急、而又巧妙、于茲益信、而滿塲飛馳、隨球影追逐不止者、内屠開元、外陳洪光耳</p>
<h3>敵軍整齊射擊欠佳</h3>
<p>華塞斯再度敗於東華之手、想非其意料所及、全隊合作之緊密、與前後攻守之堅利、有時且較佳於東華、唯一缺點、前鋒射擊人才、不及東華耳、往往兵臨城下之際、慌亂不知所云、無的放矢、隨目皆是、守門赫巴特第一流人才、所失兩球、非人力可及、而挽救之數、倍其所失、功足相抵、陶樂威老將威風、不可一世、史密斯中堅名手、的是不凡、前鋒五虎、奔跑迅速、傳遞佳妙、然能射擊者、僅阿巧一人而已、</p>
<h3>敵方得勢東華吿急</h3>
<p>鳴笛啓戰之後、華塞斯卽以全力猛撲東華防地、帶病出陣之溤運佑東招西架、煞費精神二度進窺、俱失時效、李義臣曾與小萬連環反旆、不料爲史密斯從中邀斷、康勃登與阿巧得勢又來、李寗揮之門外、阿巧爲對方唯一之危險人物、不時在東華後衛綫執戈躍馬、幸老周手脚穏重、未遭毒手、華塞斯前鋒屢攻不遂、並不因之氣餒、團團聚於東華之罰球綫内外、環攻不已、屠吳兩衛先後營救險球、李寗大氣磅礴、敵人見之喪膽、</p>
<h3>幼良深入麟經之功</h3>
<p>往來久之、始終難開紀錄之門、無可關洵安救一險球、挑送中樞、史密斯頭頂打回、馮運佑側身一勾、爲洪光所得、邁進數步、威斯登撲面驚人、洪光狡猾、短傳賈君、帶球直下、直破三關、陶樂威拚命糾纏、不料滑跌一交、遂闖下滔天大禍、球被賈氏勾送門前、愛格登又與哈力克登互生誤會、戴中鋒趁機搶前幾步、砰然一脚、四座歡騰、東華乃一對○先勝上半時、</p>
<h3>阿巧怒射打成和局</h3>
<p>時過、戰鼓又鳴、互換防地之後、東華忽然處於攻擊地位、惟以史密斯十分厲害、監視戴氏、寸步不離、李義臣不能突圍直入、乃於三十碼處遙射一脚、凖急非凡、赫巴特倒身拍出、始免大難、十分鐘之後、康勃登與阿巧兩騎得史密斯號令、啣枚疾走、霎時趕到東華後防、吳幼良一阻不得、關洵安再攔不可、罰球區内、人影橫亂、阿巧憑其堅硬之脚頭、怒射一記、周鐵門之視綫、爲人所遮、遂成和局、</p>
<h3>象華呐喊義臣發威</h3>
<p>局勢旣見平衡</p>
<p>、戰情反見激烈、象華得球快如奔馬、哈力克窮追不得、　愛格特當面被騙、球在低綫飛向門前、戴鱗經倉猝間未及預備、遂失此良機、四座曷勝浩嘆、未幾、洪光又得象華之遙傳、對門力射、但又偏門一尺、象華野心不死、得義臣幫助、又入重圍、至相當地點、美妙傳中、陶樂威與史密斯不據險要、李義臣橫身低射、擦門柱而進、赫巴特措手不及、坐失一城、此後華塞斯雖時時思我河山、然東華後防嚴密、始終不得一逞、遂以二對一敗北、</p>

<h3>香港足球甲組重要賽之一幕南華一比零克林肯前以一比二敗今則以一比零勝惟南華雖勝欲圖霸業荆棘尙多中華一比二敗於威爾殊</h3>
<p>（港訊）前次南華甲組足球隊、與林肯隊比賽、南華竟以一比二敗北、於是冠軍問題、乃大受影響、及昨星期日（七日）兩隊又復相遇、仇人見面、分外眼明、結果南華因陣勢較佳、卒於最後三分鐘、以一比零獲勝、雪前次一敗之恥焉、是日加路連由球塲、港中球迷、因震於兩隊之威名、集於此者、不下數千人、其盛况爲向來所僅見、此可知是役勝負之重要矣、南華方面、因李國威受傷、以湯坤補某缺、黃紀良以事不克出塲、由包家平充任守門、實力之勁、比原定之陣勢、未嘗稍减、林肯隊各員依舊、獨守門與兩後衛均爲乙組升任、防衛力未免稍弱也、就兩隊是日表演而論、南華較林肯略優、包家平李天生救出險球不少、尤以湯坤最勇敢、曾一次敵隊右鋒盤球逼近門前命射、情形至險、但亦卒爲湯以身擋出、此球不負、其功誠偉、前鋒馮景祥、每被敵衛所監視、故上半塲雖極得勢、而不能勝者、亦因缺乏接濟耳、季良水益之腿、與江柏之頭、觀衆皆大讚許、獨新自滬到港之李碩友、因初次合拍、未得聯絡之法、表演稍欠精彩、想李將來與諸員合拍日久、功夫自然純熟也、林肯前鋒亦極强勁、與南華不分伯仲、守門雖屬後起、然亦頗稱職、至其失敗之主因、皆後衛力弱所致耳、茲者南華雖勝、將來荆棘尙多、荀能勇往直前、不可遏止、則本屆冠軍或可再得也、</p>
<h3>南華先取攻勢</h3>
<p>南華開球、林肯中鋒希近氏卽奔前來奪、南華三中衛搶前接濟、轉瞬已傳遞至林肯腹地、聲威殊盛、足使林肯後防、見而膽落矣、林肯守門的近開門球、五前鋒殫力作攻、惟三番四次、未能衝破南華防綫、卽幸而進至腹地、亦必爲李天生所擊退、未幾、球爲李天生所得、烈厘猛奔來奪、頗覺得勢、奈何包家平妙手一動、烈厘又無可如何、包將門球傳於中樞、水益啣枚疾走、梁榮照見機而傳、楊水益遂得單刀赴會之勢、鄭季良亦加鞭直進、林肯不能支持、先負角球、水益一踢、落點極佳、譚江析本當左輔、不知何時、已潛至右方、猛起一撞、球向門中而去、昔其力不勁、致被的近救去、否則南華此時、必能先勝一球而佔優勢矣</p>
<h3>仍未得償所欲</h3>
<p>南華取勝心切、再事圍攻、在林陣前大戰、及譚江柏射力過猛、球落荒飛去、林肯之圍始解、時南華部隊　集前方不防烈厘何嘉合作進攻致使南華節節退敗、李天生目擊敵軍在路、若入無人之境、乃請繼而出、斷烈何之聯絡而傳諸前方、水益猛作妙傳、球落十二碼之處、馮景祥鄭季良譚江柏蜂擁而進、林肯陣前、危險異常、無何林肯幸運萬分、雖南華各前鋒屢仆屢射、亦能守得最後防綫、處女膜未爲南華擊破、</p>
<h3>疑得十二碼球</h3>
<p>南華以從右方而進、久未收效、乃轉命李石友爲前進主力、帶球前進、敏捷異常、於是南華又傾師而至、惜此時上半塲已完、下半塲南華雖得背日、然林肯以散兵作戰、時能要截南華進攻之師、且時時伺機攻門、雖不能取勝、然亦殊使南華有後顧之憂也、迫十五分鐘之後、南華始略能發展、但所有險球、的近輒能乎到春生、安然救去、時南華從左路前進爲多、然李石友與譚江柏未能合拍、表演未臻佳妙、迨廿五分鐘、兩軍於林肯陣前十二碼處混戰、你來我往、紛亂異常、球證號笛忽鳴、觀衆以爲必係林肯被罰十二碼自由球無疑、方遲疑間、林肯羅頓急拾球踢出、觀衆始知華隊被罰也、</p>
<h3>水益雄心勃勃</h3>
<p>旣而林肯右輔黃毛壯士麥堅尼士、　皮球溜至、乃帶前數武、遙交何嘉、何嘉盤球犯關、而轉瞬黃毛壯士已至陣前、何嘉小心翼翼、左脚傳中、麥堅尼士正擬舉足叩關、不虞湯坤健足先至化險爲夷、旣而楊水益雄心萬丈、得球直搗龍門、左中衛畢脫盡力捍衛、亦被楊水益衝過、及至最後防線、始失手被依美臣將球踢出、倘水益能再進數碼、則林肯此時必無幸也、南華全隊力戰、成績幾等於零、至是全隊人員、莫不大爲焦灼、且因李石友初次爲南華供奔走、其中奥妙、容有未悉、致譚江柏不能盡展所長、幸江柏進取之心、始終不怠、乃能於最後二分鐘得獲勝利也、</p>
<h3>江柏頭上立功</h3>
<p>是日林肯守衛力最</p>
<p>强者、厥爲正中衛榷氏、幾使馮景祥無射門機會、内鋒之中、惟鄭季良及譚江柏略能活動而已、此時南華不顧利害、撇下後方、以求先勝、果然勝球機會已臨、鄭季良一球送來、譚江柏迎頭一撞、觀者份外眼明、一見皮球已在網内、敵門乃陷、觀者無不鼓掌頓足、喜極若狂、最後結果、南華遂以一比零報復、一雪前次失敗之恨、雙方陣線如下、</p>

<h3>合作的精神</h3>
<p>— 人偉</p>
<p>在我的幼年時代，曾經記得小學敎科書上有那麽一段：「四肢埋怨口腔只會吃飯不会做事，口腔埋怨胃囊只會消化不會食物，胃囊埋怨大腸只會吸收滋養料不會消化。結果，四肢罷工了，口腔沒飯吃，胃囊沒有食品消化，大腸沒有滋養可吸收；終於四肢也得不到滋養的供給而動彈不得了」小朋友！我這裏有一個很適當的比喻：四肢好像勞動者，口腔與胃囊，無異小資產階級，大腸就好比大資本家。社會上原不應有什麽階級的分歧；不過，勞動者脫離不了小資本家；小資本家脫離不了大資本家；大資本家也脫離不了勞動者。這三者之間，正好比人體一樣，誰也不能埋怨誰，誰也不能脫離了誰。可惜現社會各個階級，只知道一己的私利，更沒有合作的精神，其結果不免同歸於盡，大家跑到一條毁滅的路上去罷了！</p>
<p>小朋友！你們將來大了，在社會上無論做勞動者也好，做小資本家也好，做大資本家也好；不過，切不可互相衝突，决鬭，以致於勢不兩立，你們應當拿合作的精神，一同跑向光明的路上去！</p>
<h3>不衛生的王安石</h3>
<p>— 袁翕孚</p>
<p>王安石是宋朝的宰相，他對於政治，文學，都是很有研究的，他曾把宋朝的政治改變過；他有不少的著作傳下來。但是他是絶不講究衛生的人。</p>
<p>他不梳頭；不洗澡：不換身上的衣服。</p>
<p>有一天，有一個蝨子爬在他的鬍鬚上，他的朋友對他說：「你鬚上有一個蝨子呢！」安石文縐縐的說道：「偶游相鬚，曾經御覽」呢！他就是說：這個蝨子，偶然到宰相的鬍鬚上來玩玩，曾給皇帝看見過的呢！</p>
<p>說罷！哈哈大笑。</p>
<p>小經騐</p>
<p>— 劍芬</p>
<h3>臨帖</h3>
<p>小朋友：你們的習字簿是不是九宮格？在剛學臨帖的時候，你們感覺臨帖臨得不像嗎？現在我用很簡單的方法來吿訴你們：（一）先用和帖上的字一樣大小玻璃一方；（二）玻璃上照九宮格的格子用墨筆劃好；（三）臨帖的时候，把劃好九宮格的玻璃，覆在帖的字上；（四）照玻璃映出來的字，依着格子的部份，臨到九宮格的簿上。這樣，臨出來的字，雖然不能和帖上的字畢肖，但總比空臨好些了。</p>
<p>（附白）小朋友：如果你們的習字簿是白紙簿祇要用和簿子大小的白紙一張，劃成九宮格的形式，放在臨帖紙的下面，那未白紙也就映成九宮格了。</p>
<h3>鋼筆尖</h3>
<p>當你用新鋼筆｜（不是自來水筆）｜或新鋼筆尖的时候，往往筆尖醮好墨水，但冩不出字來：｜（有時或許能冩出字來，不過少數）｜這是什麽緣故呢？大槪是筆尖染着「製造筆尖機器」上的油，……：所以冩不出字來，這時，你祇要用紙頭把筆尖揩擦兩下；最好</p>
<p>先用一枝自來火燃着，把筆尖燒過以後，再用紙擦。這樣，筆尖就可指揮如意了。</p>

<p>漢口市立小學的兒童裁判所</p>
<p>— 趙鵬</p>
<p>漢口市立第一小學校，設備方面，非常完善，該校除設有幼稚園，民生銀行，販賣部，模範村外；另外再設立兒童裁判所，目的是在養成兒童法律常識，增進兒童自治的能力，雖然組織簡单，但是規模却很完備，所内辦事却井井有條，現在特地將該所的内容介紹在下面，希望本埠的小學生不妨來試試。</p>
<h3>女學生充任所長</h3>
<p>該所的組織非常簡單，計爲所長一人，裁判員二名，書記員二名，庭丁二名，均爲義務職，並無伕馬費辦公費，均由學生擔任。</p>
<h3>形形式式的淘氣案</h3>
<p>該校學生，大都是七八歲到十一二歲左右，當然學生中間，難免沒有淘氣行爲，因此裁判所方面，受理的案件，都不外下列的各種：（一）借書有還，（二）借錢不還，（三）北地駡人，（四）無故打人，（五）搶東西吃，（六）用粉筆冩字，或畫鳥龜在他人身上，（七）汚穢他人衣服，（八）打架，（九）偷人東西。</p>
<h3>問案時儼然法庭</h3>
<p>裁判所受理案件後，就定期開庭，原被吿都要到庭投案，各人供述案情，六年級的學生可以做律師，代表出庭替當事人辯護，所長廉得案情後，量其情節輕重，分别判决，計分：記過，賠償，罰站，道歉，假使挾嫌誣吿，就要反坐</p>
<h3>訓育處最高法院</h3>
<p>假使裁判對於某一案判决不公，或有偏袒行爲，敗訴者卽可向訓育主任（卽最高法院）提起上訴，再度開庭審判，判决後，卽作爲定讞。</p>
<h3>水的奇妙</h3>
<p>— 許宗傑</p>
<p>日常喝的和用的，也是人生一日不可缺少的東西，那便是水了。我們司空見慣，一些不覺得奇妙。但是細細的一考察，覺得世間任何東西，沒有比它再奇妙的了。</p>
<p>它是流動的「液體」，日光蒸晒，化汽上昇，便變成「氣體」了。遇冷結成了冰，像水晶般的澄澈，像石塊般的堅硬，那便是「固體」了。一件東西，能具「液」「氣」「固」三樣的變化，除了水以外，你們想還有别的東西嗎？</p>
<p>這還不算奇妙，它化汽上騰，遇冷便變成雨點。雨點下降，遇冷便變成六出的雪花；或是黃豆般大小的冰雹。近地面的水汽，在夜裏便變成露珠；再寒冷一些，便變成濃縮。其實雨露霜雪，都是水的魔術。</p>
<p>它的性子平穏無比，一側下就要流去。所以科學家拿它做平面的標凖，𪰧做�水平綫」。</p>
<p>水眞是奇妙的東西，小朋友倘使不信我的話，不妨細細的考察一下。</p>
<h3>快快剪去你的指甲</h3>
<p>— 寗自强</p>
<p>小朋友！你們手上有指甲嗎？請從今天起，把他剪得乾乾凈凈罷！爲什麽呢？指甲是傳染疾病的媒介物，是殺人的劊子手，指甲怎能殺人呢？原來你們用手玩了不乾凈的東西，一會兒又抓住食物狼呑虎咽的去吃，於是疾病的媒介物，便由不知不覺的中間，吃進肚子裏去了。</p>
<p>不乾凈的食物吃進去之後，不是要害病嗎！虎列拉呀！百斯篤呀！白喉痧呀！赤痢呀！病得兇險的，可以制人死命，這不是劊子手是什麽？</p>
<p>小朋友！不但指甲要剪却，便是手也要去常洗，不洗手，不吃食物，這　是防病的法子哪！</p>
<h3>三到</h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>小朋友們！我吿訴你一件故事吧！</p>
<p>有一個人到一個朋友家去，那朋友是定在九點鐘會面的。他怱忙的走，忽然聽見有人喊「九點到了，九點到了。」他很着急，怕誤了時，便問那喊的人道；</p>
<p>「怎麽已到了九點鐘？」</p>
<p>那喊的人笑說：「你錯了，我喊「酒店到了」，你聽錯九點到了。」</p>
<p>小朋友，我們做事要眼到，手到，心到，三到呀！</p>
<h3>小老鼠出洞</h3>
<p>— 顏波光</p>
<p>一隻小老鼠的洞裏對它母親說：「母親！我今天預備出去遊玩！遊玩！</p>
<p>它母親說：「你到外面去切不可貪吃！防備人家拿好吃的東西誘你。」</p>
<p>小老鼠連忙回說：「知道了！」</p>
<p>一出洞門，它覺得有趣極了，五花八門眞是好玩，突然的看見一隻美麗的鐡絲籠，籠的裏面放着香甜的餅，它把母親交代的話忘記了，把身子鑽入籠内，東西沒有吃完，早把自已關在籠内了，但是它母親還在深深的盼望兒子，爲什麽不早些回來呢。</p>
<h3>農村小友的通問</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>凋木</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們：</p>
<p>當着秋的墳墓完成的時候，那冬之神，張牙舞爪掮着鐡斧，擺起猙獰的面孔來了，來和世界開始火併。那蒼翠蓬勃的深林，變了，爲着它變了，變成紅的，黃的顏色。結果御下枝葉，只剩蕭條條！風婆呼呼刮。幸而有一二隻小鳥來憑弔，却被獵人在不提防間「砰」的一聲，又爲被憑弔的可憐蟲！</p>
<p>記得三年前有一回事，大槪是這樣：二三十個兵，荷槍實彈，並且裝著刺刀；洋號「的的大」「的的大」的狂喊着：在兵士後排有許多男男女女老老幼幼的民衆跟着。我仔細去看：大家擁着一個赤膊兩手反縛的人：到了一個地點，那被縛的人跪下來，他正跪下來，後面跳出一個人，拿着雪亮的刀，只隠約聽得一聲「刺」，那頭是可以搬動的西瓜了。在這一刹那間，拍掌聲和喊「殺」聲，雖如雷動，而『恐怖，肅殺」之氣仍然。看的人，都毛骨悚然，好像久留卽有罹刀禍之慘，一溜烟散空：｜不，還有一位手仍反縛沒有頭的屍！</p>
<p>小友們：替這位沒頭的人，傷悲嗎？</p>
<p>要知道御下枝葉的樹木，在冬的暴威之下，那有二致？</p>
<p>枯草</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們：</p>
<p>這個世界，我和你們住在上面的這個世界，是時時刻刻，刻刻時時在變動着。人事是這樣，自然也是這樣。秋死冬生，自然的變化，不過特别顯著罷了。</p>
<p>那些樹木是綁赴刑塲去了；那些花兒草兒，却不知到那裏去了，去到那一個世界？｜｜芬芳香馥，鮮艶絶麗的花朶，曾招來許多人的留戀，賞鑑：短草如針，綠茵平舖；曾記得在不久之前，我們眞活潑的小友，睡於斯，跳於斯，舞於斯。現在綠的世界去了。可怕的，這一個「變」的世界！</p>
<p>有幾位衣服襤褸的小友，夾着一紮枯草。｜這些小友，大槪是江北船户的子弟；他們或者爲着上帝的付託，特到各處替枯草「收屍」，結果「火葬」！</p>
<p>但，有許多花草，很蓬勃地在花房裏晒太阳，烘水汀：它們發芽，抽條，含苞，放花；却未嘗知道「冬」的味道兒。也不知道其餘花草的慘狀。</p>
<p>植物也有幸與不幸，奇？｜</p>
<p>這信和你們相見時，恐怕是在民國二十三年的歲首，所以在此地祝你們</p>
<p>新年快樂和進步</p>

<h3>新年</h3>
<p>— 華南小學六年級生韓曉霞</p>
<p>新年來了，不久又把得明媚的春光，從天涯海角裏帶了來，賜給我們這般活潑天眞的小朋友了。這是一件多麽快活的事情啊！</p>
<p>但，在我每次放學回家的時候，總看到我親愛的爸媽，在愁眉苦臉地對坐着，或是在唉聲嘆氣地談議着，｜｜因了「人欠」「欠人」的經濟問題｜｜這些也是使我在快樂之餘而覺到掃興的事情。</p>
<p>昨晚，我的媽坐在床上，不知從那裏來的興致，講了一叚關於新年的故事給我聽，伊說：「年」是一種吃人猛獸，每隔三百六十餘天，就要出現一次，出外的目的，是吃人；所以元旦一日，人家都是關門閉户地躱在家裏，避「年」，到第二日，大家才出外閒逛，遇着熟人，都是互稱「恭喜」，｜｜「閉户」是防「年」，「恭喜」是賀你逃脫「年」的毒口，沒有被「年」吃掉，｜｜」</p>
<p>到現在，我還記得，很淸楚的記得，而且還似乎有些駭怕。</p>
<p>不過，一想到明媚的春光，以及媽手裏正在代我縫着的新衣，爸昨日從城裏買回來的糕餅，不覺又使我快樂得手舞足蹈起來了。</p>
<h3>一个孩子的失敗</h3>
<p>— 松江十三歲小學生居承昌</p>
<p>從前有一個小孩子，在園地裏遊玩，走來走去，忽然；看見一隻麻雀跌在地上，狂呌着，這孩子就用一雙小手把麻雀拿起來看，見它一隻脚已斷去了，孩子就拿布來把麻雀斷去的一隻脚，紮紮好，放在樹上，一會兒，這麻雀就飛去了。</p>
<p>後來，這隻麻雀啣一粒子來，落在孩子的園地裏，隔幾天，那一粒種子，就變成一隻西瓜了。孩子看見了這一西瓜，很快活的把西瓜採下來，用刀切開，裏面有大的，小的，珠子寶貝，孩子就拿珠子給媽媽，媽媽很快活，這孩子也很快活。隔壁的一個孩子聽見了，就去捉住一隻麻雀，扳斷了一隻脚，也用布紮好，放麻雀飛去，隔幾天，那麻雀也啣一粒種子來落在他的園地裏，再隔幾天，也生了一隻西瓜，孩子很快活，他說；「我也有大珠子來了……」於是就採了下來，用刀切開，西瓜裏面，發出一團火來，把孩子燒死了。</p>

<h3>標粉局面頗冷淡</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初堅後疲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好二三角、坎拿大好四五角左右、故初開時、市價較前日微好半分、不過各盤交易、異常淸淡、實銷帮均無意思、故人心又懈、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易、仍然冷寂、惟以廠家態度不一、以實銷如是不振、當然不能硬擯、但另一部分、則仍撑住也、結果本月份未動、二月份好五厘、三月份好二厘半、四月份不動、五月份好五厘、六月份好一分、</p>
<h3>期麥在靜定中</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈盤旋之象、以洋麥報價、回好二三四五角左右、業中人心思、未免稍佳、但以結帪期間步近、行廠方面、均少交易、故上午初六月份開出一價、餘均空拍、下午略有交易、出入亦無幾、結果本月份未動、二四月份好一分、六月份未動、餘均未開、現麥市面、因到稀之故、逐步喊高、聞山東白麥開一千餘包、價四元零五分、由申大辦去、</p>
<h3>美粉麥出售有辦法</h3>
<p>政府所借美粉麥之出售辦法、聞與粉業中人數度接洽、已有辦法、麥約計十六萬噸、粉有六百四十萬包、自本年下月起、於一年内分批運華、俾於推銷之中、仍得調劑之效、</p>
<h3>晚稻滯銷略軟二分</h3>
<p>（滬南）各帮來源尙湧、絡繹抵埠者七十餘號、</p>
<p>（萬餘石）其中晚稻仍有三十餘艘、而其客帮包胃竟以昨市經一度之暢辦後、孰料卽因此而反呈呆滯、現無形停頓之狀、故市况初則似含垂疲之勢、售方亦遂不願因此而輕脫、致環境立見淸寂、及後幸行家上棧者出手動辦、其如靑角松泗楓練貨始去一千餘包、行情略修二分、各帮厚粳及杜洋尖店胃稍活、市况亦似稍轉、常帮蘇同帮南港等貨大勢略能平定、惟仍含軟色耳、變陰元時令所繫而堅穏</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各地到頭二十餘號、市上各種銷胃仍然滯細、市形日趨下游、白粳白元早薄稻陰元價小角許、羊杜埠客尖亦小數分、</p>
<h3>客秈高貨穏定</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、初仍平疲、繼有本街賬米問訊、且閩省時局漸趨安定、人心漸次向好、囤買與賬濟各方均有辦意、故市面似可逐次轉機、惟市上高貨不多、存到中次居多、故高貨已可站住、中次仍在看疲中、昨客貨有甬帮辦去江西機晚一百包、價六元五角半、本街與賬濟去江西機紅米四十三包、價六元五角四分、湖南機紅九十三包、價六元五角四分、又砶靖米五百六十包、價五元八角半至五元八角、其他進出兩乏云、</p>
<h3>黃豆售價轉緊</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆續砌二三分、實因賣方售意轉緊、來源不湧、去路蟬聯、人心堅穏、且市價已跌至底盤、致賣買雙方心思一致看好、氣象甚緊、但望來貨接而不湧、去路續而不斷、後市或可見挺、昨共成交車輪各豆約十一二車、計正陽關豆開三元五角至四角、徐州豆三元四角三、黃口豆三元三角半、歸德豆三元四角半至三角三、信陽州豆三元三角二至三角、大連豆開二車、價扯四元三角五、由本街辦去、平湖杜豆開二百包、價爲四元九角及四元七角七、乃甬帮與本街分去云、</p>

<p>昨日糖市、因値週六、今日無裝出、交易不多、趨勢仍疲、惟潮靑據汕頭電訊續升三角、號盤轉緊、公會劃盤二四號粗砂白呌十八元九角半、無受手、荷赤太古糖均呌原價、亦未做出、本廠綿白又降一角、振記一號爲十七元九角、二號七角、三號五角、四號三角、潮靑查首盤提莊靑會到十五元五角、前後步降三元餘、現以地價前昨兩日回升五角、號盤稍見振色、開出四百包之譜、價十二元、又十一元九角至十一元六角、好起角許、有續緊勢、可謂大跌小回頭也、新棉赤開百數包、價爲十五元至十四元七角、刁靑亦稍帶好、昨已開通、</p>
<p>五金</p>
<h3>會司鐵到旺銷滯</h3>
<p>會司鐵市面、近因客帮生意閑散、而本街製罐廠香烟廠餅乾公司等採辦不多、故趨勢極覺冷落、所以開價一層、十分軟弱、每箱價格如老鋼廠貨估二十九元五角、新鋼廠貨開二十八元二角半、均比前爲鬆動、惟到貨一節、目今進口甚旺、故堆存在浦東浦西各洋棧爲數甚夥、所以前途趨勢、殊難樂觀也云、</p>
<h3>紫銅昨電跌一元</h3>
<p>紫銅昨日紐約來電虛弱、故本埠市氣萎靡、標凖跌落一元、售價每擔爲四十四元五角、交易祗</p>
<p>有百餘擔、</p>
<h3>竹節鋼條售價步鬆</h3>
<p>竹節鋼條、昨市祇售一百○八元、比前又鬆二元、交易建築帮尙好、客帮採辦已屬寥少、惟年内到貨極旺、市情空洞、行情一層、頗難維持、</p>
<p>油市</p>
<h3>年燭將銷柏油上漲</h3>
<p>柏油自漢口新貨頭盤開後、因各處均須稍辦、而鎭江上海蘇州寗波等處、均有數千擔辦成、且有至宜昌採辦者、乃來源適於斯時轉稀、以致供不敷求、蓋値此新貨當旺之際、其來源不旺者、並非產地無貨、係是長江上游各河道水枯、裝運不及所致、而各處燭淘正在製造年燭、用塲當然與平時不同、不約而同向漢市採辦、現貨因此不敷分派、市面亦卽上漲、據昨得漢函謂重荆已加至每擔十八元、平荆十七元四五角、麻城油十六元五六角、較頭盤漲起一元光景、本埠行家聞有四五千件辦成、正在絡繹開始裝運、故連日長江輪班日有裝到、售盤亦已依據漢市加增、計售重荆每擔二十一元七八角、平荆二十一元光景、麻城照市秤十八元稍零、浙江柏油亦隨同見漲、聞内坪油售至二十元零二三角、蘭柏亦有十六元以上之說、確否不知耳、浙西之本車據送申須二十一元、未免加至太過、照市秤價、則二十元零五六角、似平允也、本埠各貨、惟江西油續有到下、若老牌之楊春和、前曾開過二十元零五角客盤、現恐非二十一元不可矣、餘如温台等油、則貨品較遜、故客盤仍在二十元以内、惟此次之漲、並非完全各處製燭銷塲所鼓動、而固本廠皂用亦有辦去萬擔左右、被雙方擠軋而成也、</p>

<h3>拍賣文明</h3>
<p>— 鳳子</p>
<p>人類眞是最文明的東西，世界至於今日，確已開化到無以復加了。便是牲畜，據說也要予以恩澤。希特拉先生禁止虐待閉口動物；蘇格蘭事務大臣不准擾亂洛區尼斯的海獸；日本陸軍大臣追贈最高功章給進攻北大營時陣亡的軍用犬。這三件事，也許情形各别，但同屬文明國家的盛典，倒也毫無疑義的。</p>
<p>希特拉先生初登寳座，最著的德政是焚燒書籍，排斥異己，驅逐猶太人，接着便來這麽一道愛護閉口動物的命令。初看起來，這些事情出諸一人之手，好像有些滑稽，其實前幾件是他的本意，而後者不過是「殺人滅跡」的故智。</p>
<p>文明要待善價而沽，然而也可以减價拍賣的。</p>
<p>英國的紳士比希特拉先生更文明。洛區尼斯的海獸又不常出現，不至於危害帝國。而且這海獸還有使紳士們愜意的地方，那便是有些「奇異」；所以通吿一出，「輿情大慰」，也還是這個緣故。甘地到英國，英國的紳士們便擁到碼頭去歡迎；歡迎的並不是甘地能來替印度爭自由，不過是要瞻仰瞻仰這只奇異的印度瘦象。這和歡迎海京伯馬戲團完全是一樣心理。</p>
<p>所以歡迎儘管歡迎，而印度却還是印度。恩澤居然到了牲畜的身上，看來文明是只配拍賣的。</p>
<p>日本陸軍大臣所激賞的寳貝是軍用犬。旣屬功狗，理該一視同仁的。何况是後起的文明國家。可是犬而稱爲軍用，這就未免太露骨了。而且北大營的血，瀋陽的屍身，甚而至於四省的骷髏，據說和咱们還有同胞之義。但文明的討價對這些同胞是太奢，這便宜反倒讓牲畜佔去了。</p>
<p>中國人大槪是還要含着眼涙來賞識這一些文明的。</p>
<p>然而只要是高等或上等的華人，其實也還有「固有」的文明，那便是「君子吃</p>
<p>肉而遠疱廚」。但這可並不拍賣。</p>
<p>說得透澈一些，這是連拍賣也談不到。</p>
<h3>論冩實小說答穆木天</h3>
<p>— 陳君冶</p>
<p>關於『冩實小說與第一人稱冩法』問題，已經引起鄭重的討論，這正如穆先生說未嘗不是有益處的，所以在我與穆先生仍具着不同的意見時，我還是要有話說的。我首先要申明，我和穆先生的論點，並無不同，如果論點不同，討論也就會减少了意義。</p>
<p>（一）穆先生在『再談冩實小說與第一人稱寫法』裏，認『在現在的文化落後的中國，冩農工的小說用第一人稱冩法，更容易流於滑𥡴』，我以爲穆先生的這理解包括着許多不正確的傾向，這很容易發展到表現農工的小說，必要到中國文化提高了之後，農工自己能冩小說的時候才許有表現農工的小說出現，不消說，這是一個錯誤的理解，而且是一個極危險的理解，如果要推察這錯誤的根原，這不外乎是站在分析的現實主義的觀點之上（穆先生深深受了弗羅貝爾思想的影響，是無疑的。）以爲除却了把客觀的現實照像式地反映出來則是有損於眞實的，『揚媽的日記』必定要揚媽自已去寫，而且要冩得那樣拙劣才像是合於眞實似的。但是，只有那類單純的旁觀主義者們才以這種卑俗的自然主義或分析的冩實主義爲滿足，穆先生恰恰是（他的理論證實了他）這類的旁觀主義其中之一，他把農工和作者大膽地分開，互相立在兩個不同的地位，作者永遠與作品中人物完全不相干，只是用旁觀的態度去觀察他們而表現他們，我不能不說這種認識對於穆先生的思想上是最大的危機。</p>
<p>（二）第一人稱冩法過去爲浪漫主義作家們所慣用，作爲他們底個人主義的抒情主義的表現的手法，我早承認這是事實，但是，第一人稱冩法被用到新的内容（表現農工階級的感情的）的外觀時，那已經再不能把它看作個人主義的抒情主義的形式，由於其本質的不同已經把它的形式向新的方面轉化，已經再不可稱它爲舊的形式了。穆先生舉别德納伊沿用了寓言詩的形式冩了不少的大衆的詩歌，竟承認其内容是新的，而其寓言詩的形式却還是舊的，這更是不正確的理解，我們如去考察一下别德納伊的寓言詩究竟與其他的古代的寓言其間存在着何等的不同，便可以得着證明。舊的形式適合於新的内容而當作表現手法被採用的時候，這形式已再不是舊的，我在這裏敢於重覆一句。我們對於一個問題的理解，如果不捉着它的全般和其能動的特性，必然地要陷入布爾喬亞一面性的理解和認識的狹路上去。</p>
<p>（三）關於文學的眞實性的問題，穆先生說，是同在其中所反映的複雜的現實的分量成反比例的，從這句話，我以爲穆先生是又犯着了自然主義的理論的根本的缺陷，文學的眞實性的獲取是在把握着感性的人類的活動底實踐之認識，自然主義者才以描冩範圍的量的多寡來作决定，所以作爲自然主義文學的特色，是在把一切事物不論價値地加以觀察，加以羅列。他們的目的在包羅萬象，他們以爲那樣才可以得到客觀的『眞實』，這就造成了自然主義的精密和煩瑣以至於無限的程度。這也就是穆先生爲文學眞實性而要求的量吧？我們如果測度一個文學作品的眞實性，我們只觀察它所描冩的範圍，來定其高下的程度，這不是成其爲笑談？對於這一問題，穆先生對我的批駁，不僅未得更進一步的理論，反更增加了不正確的見解，這是使我衷心地感到惋惜的。</p>
<p>（四）關於第一人稱冩法與冩實小說這問題我們必須立在社會主義的現實主義上才能把握着正確的理解，僅逗留在自然主義的現實主義，純旁觀主義的地域裏散步，對於現實主義只知作着手法和形式等等之探求，我可以判斷，他會永遠地得不着光明的路途可以走的。巴爾札克左拉等的冩實主義，事實上並不是現在我們所要求的，我們現在要求着綜合的冩實主義！</p>
<h3>除夕夜</h3>
<p>— 陳福熙</p>
<p>分歲夜。</p>
<p>在一間温暖的房間裏，一對年靑夫婦，正在喫着豐盛的晚餐。房間裏是靜靜地，祗有他們倆｜｜</p>
<p>「珍，我揀一塊雞肉給你，今天的雞特别好喫……」</p>
<p>妻沒有應，也不點頭。</p>
<p>帶着憂鬱氣息的，這靜寂的房中：</p>
<p>她坐着，蹙着眉，記起一件忘却的事。｜｜她不　　，也不　酒，痛苦的回憶，儘是擾亂她的心緒。她臉色蒼白，消瘦，憔悴，患着沉重的歇斯的里亞。她的年紀已經三十多，看外表，足足有四十歲了；可是她還沒有子女……</p>
<p>今夜，她坐在桌前，一點東西都喫不下。雖桌面上擺滿着魚，肉，雞，是新鮮的，油香的，美味的，但她的喉頭，總好像用木塞塞住了似的。</p>
<p>她竟連一滴湯水都嚥不下。</p>
<p>丈夫不聽見妻回答，於是又說：</p>
<p>「你爲什麽這樣不快活呢？」</p>
<p>「不，我很快活……」</p>
<p>她勉强抬高頭，搖了幾搖；然後，又將頭低下去。好久：｜｜晶瑩的淚珠，一串串的，從她的眼眶内吊下。</p>
<p>房間裏是靜靜的。</p>
<p>他看着妻哭，再沒有心思飲酒。他的心，也跟着亂了。他實在不明白她，爲什麽在這分歲的晚餐上鳴咽？他又不知道她爲什麽事這樣悲傷？……他只釘住她，發着楞，有許多話想說，但連一句話也難出口。他不曉得怎樣說，才能安慰她，才能停止她的欷歔？</p>
<p>「珍,爲什麽哭呢？今夜是分歲，我們應該快活些……」</p>
<p>「是的，應該……我再不想……」</p>
<p>「想什麽？」丈夫馬上問。</p>
<p>「想小寳寳……」</p>
<p>妻說不下去，聲音發着顫抖。丈夫聽到這話，一肚子的悲哀，早也統統湧上心頭，使他不能壓抑。然而，看到珒妻哭，看到妻發怔，他祇得向她說：</p>
<p>「不要想她了，今夜是分歲……」</p>
<p>說時，他不由自主的提起酒杯，連連的喝了幾口酒。</p>
<p>妻哭着……</p>
<p>房間裏是靜靜的。</p>
<p>因爲酒喝得太多，丈夫已經快醉。丈夫的眼睛，紅紅的，也幾乎要淌淚了。</p>
<p>喝過一通酒，他忽然記起一件事，便問：</p>
<p>「如果小寳寳不死，她有多少年紀了？」</p>
<p>「阿吓！你忘了嗎？」妻哭着說，聲音仍是顫抖的。</p>
<p>「忘了！完全忘了！」</p>
<p>「咦，你眞忘了？小寳寳的生肖是肖兎啦！……」</p>
<p>「唔，不錯！如果不死，她已經有……」</p>
<p>話只說到一半，他又將酒杯澆到嘴唇上去。</p>
<p>房間裏是靜靜的。</p>
<h3>韋爾斯的預言：一九三五年中日大戰記</h3>
<p>— 孟眞</p>
<p>新年來到，預言一時成爲非常的流行，有好幾種雜誌在徽求一九三四年的預言。本來，我們生當這種聖明之世，還有何話可說？於是遂只好預言將來了。</p>
<p>HG韋爾斯的預言，當九月間曾由路透社拍專電報吿，記得上海各報上都有過登載。這位「歷史大綱」的著者，除爲歷史家以外，其社會主義者，文明批評家，通俗小說家的聲名，用不着什麽介紹，想來是誰都知道。但尤値得我們注意的，是他科學的觀察，深遠的想像，以及犀利的批評。所以自這本預言小說「未來的姿態」（The　Shape　of　things　to　Come)的出版，立卽捲起世界讀書的激動。</p>
<p>最近，這本書也到了我們中國了。據他的自述，這猶之他從前所著的「世界簡史」（樊仲雲譯，商務書館出版），是一本叙述一九一三｜二一一六這百五十年間的，未來的簡史。他假託爲雷文博士的說夢（The　Dream　Book　ofDrPhilip　Raveu),好像只是，「空中樓閣的預言，其實，却具有非常濃厚的現實的色彩，尤其是第一卷，今日與明日」簡直就是這二十年來的歷史。第二卷以下是關於未來的，但行文立論，以科學的，經濟的理論爲基礎，所以卽或是夢，也許可說是科學的夢罷。</p>
<p>全書分爲五卷，首述崩潰期的到來（第一卷），次爲崩潰期，三爲世界的復興，卽現代國家的誕生，四爲現代國家運動，五爲現代國家所管理的生活共約二十萬字。由他的預言，世界大戰在四十年代，是崩潰期内的事，而爲其序幕者，則一九三五年的中日戰爭，以後轉而爲美日戰爭，至三九年，以日本敗績，吿其終局。以後經過世界大戰，於是只求自利的資本主義世界，崩潰完了，至二十一世紀，乃走上建設新世界之路。　　　　　　　（未完）</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（八）（五）</h3>
<p>— 莫伯桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>當她把酒拿來時，他又說道：</p>
<p>「我特爲來和你吿别的。我要出門了。」</p>
<p>她毫不注意的回答：</p>
<p>「啊啊！你要到那裏去呢？」</p>
<p>「美國。」</p>
<p>「聽說這是一個漂亮的國度呢。」</p>
<p>便再沒有說别的了。眞的，揀着今天來和她說話也實在冒失極了。今天咖啡店裏人實在太多了。</p>
<p>於是筆爾出來向海邊走去。當他走到堤岸時，他看見那載着他的父親和博齊汝船長轉來的「珍珠」號釣船。水手巴巴格里在划着槳；那兩個人坐在船尾帶着一種十分幸福的臉色在抽着。烟斗。醫生瞧着他們經過時，心裏想：「頭腦簡單的人眞快樂呀。」</p>
<p>於是他坐在防波堤上的一張凳上，想使自己痳痺在一種畜牲的半睡狀態裏。</p>
<p>當他晚上回到家裏的時候，他的母親不敢把眼睛抬起來看他，祇對他說道：</p>
<p>「你動身以前要添置很多東西的，我却有點不知從何下手。我剛才替你定了一些襯衣襯褲，並到裁縫店裏關照他來給你裁衣；可是你不需要别的東西嗎，不需要也許有我所想不到的東西嗎？」</p>
<p>他開口想說：「不，什麽都不需要。」可是他想至少他得接受那使自己穿得不失體面的衣物，他於是以一種非常寗靜的聲音回答道：</p>
<p>「我現在還不知道；我要到公司裏去問問。」</p>
<p>他去問了，有人給了他一張必需品的單子。他母親從他手裏接去那張單子時，許久以來這算是第一次瞧着他，她眼底裏有着一種那樣低首下心，那樣温和，那樣悲傷，像被人打過之後求饒着的可憐的狗那樣乞求的表情。</p>
<p>十月一日「洛蘭勒」號郵船由聖納仄爾（SaintˉNazaire）開進了哈佛爾港，以便同月七日由那裏開往紐約：而筆爾羅蘭便得住到那間飄浮着的小房間裏，這小房間是以後拘囚着他的生命的所在。</p>
<p>第二天，當他出去的時候，他在樓梯上遇着他的母親，她在等着他，以一種幾乎聽不淸楚的聲音對他輕輕的說：</p>
<p>「你不要我帮你到船上去佈置你的房間嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，謝謝你，都已佈置好了。」</p>
<p>她咕嘟道：</p>
<p>「我非常想看看你的房間呢。」</p>
<p>「用不着看。這是很醜並且很小的。」</p>
<p>他過去了，讓她在那裏頽喪欲絶，倚着牆壁，面無人色。</p>
<p>可是就在那天去參觀過「洛闌勒」號郵船的羅闌老爹，晚飯的時候一直談着這壯麗的輪船，並且對於他的女人毫沒有想去看看的情形頗覺驚異，因爲他們的兒子將要乘坐這雙郵船呀。</p>
<p>在以後接着來到的那幾天裏，筆爾簡直不大在家。他是神經過敏，容易發怒，冷酷無情，而他的粗魯的話語像是鞭擊着衆人似的。可是在他動身的前一天，他却突然現得大不相同了</p>
<p>，現得非常温和了。當他第一次上船去睡之前，和他的雙親抱吻的時候，他問他們道：</p>

<h3>是不是生意經？</h3>
<p>— 韓德輝</p>
<p>你如果爲省事起見，走到衣莊裏去想買件新製或原典的衣服穿穿的話，店員先生必定拿出許多質料不一顏色不同的新舊衣服讓你選擇，並且很客氣的請你穿上身上試試看。他等到你把衣服一穿上身去，必定做出一種出乎意外的欣悅的神氣，說：『先生！這件衣服好像特地替你做的一般，再巧沒有，再合身也沒有了！』你如果嫌太短，他便說：『先生！你自已低下頭來看看呀！』你把頭一低，身體向前一俯，衣服的前幅也隨着垂下來，自然你自己不覺得其短了。你如果嫌太長，他便說：『先生！你的身幹還沒有挺直呢！』你照他的話把身幹一挺，衣服的前幅自然吊高了，並不覺得長；但是後幅垂下來掃着地，你沒有後眼，却看不見。你經過他一番導演之後，果然感覺滿意，於是交易乃吿成功。至於這件衣服究竟合身不合身，那是另一問題；總而言之，他的這筆生意是做成了。</p>
<p>太太小姐們到綢緞店裏去購衣料，對於尺寸上總想沾點便宜。譬如她要買一丈長的衣料，店員量到一丈，正要裁斷的時候，她便急忙用手　着，不許下剪，說：『放！放！放！放！』兩寸不够，四寸不够，六寸還是不够，八寸還是不够，甚而至於放到一尺多纔能滿意。你如果不肯的話，她不但要駡你做生意太死板，而且也許要撅着嘴，鼓着腮，提着錢袋，氣冲冲的掉頭走了。所以店員們爲使交易做成起見，呌放就放，等到她不十分堅執要放了　敢下剪。但是她回到家去，再把衣料自己用尺一量，一丈還不是一丈嗎？爭了又爭，何嘗有得多呢？原來店員深知道太太小姐們的脾氣，他在量的時候，每尺扣了一寸，</p>
<p>後來所放的一尺，已經預先留有餘地；因爲不如此，這筆生意就會被别家做去了。</p>
<p>上述兩事，不知是否就是所謂「生意經」？</p>

<h3>吃鷄尾巴</h3>
<p>— 陳賡</p>
<p>正在車間裏把剛領來的新賬簿開面子，阿保那小厮却跳着進來說道：「陳先生，那種痘子的醫生又來了。」</p>
<p>「唔，在那兒？」</p>
<p>「經理室裏。」</p>
<p>經理室裏，舖了一桌子的大瓶小瓶，那麽尖銳的亮光光的扦兒，一個穿中國棉袍子的，一個穿西洋裝的，還有一個穿着白色外套的女人，說都是醫生哪。</p>
<p>「辛苦了，」經理對穿西洋裝的說。</p>
<p>「還好，也是呌幹了這行當，倒霉的就派在工廠區，　得怕人的工人……」他這樣回答說。</p>
<p>那女的抖抖肩膀，又瞧瞧壁上的時辰鐘：「先生種嗎？要種就先替你種，這時傢具比較淸潔些。」</p>
<p>「嘿嘿嘿嘿，好，煩勞了，不過，嘿嘿，還有我的太太，她從小沒種過痘，嘿嘿，亦煩勞一下吧。」經理笑着說，一邊自己解紐口兒，一邊飭人到後面請經理娘娘。</p>
<p>先由穿棉袍子的醫生在經理粗肥的胳膊上抺了一層藥水，後由女醫生替他種痘，再由穿西洋裝的醫生替他上罩包紮好。接着，經理娘娘，副經理……都種過，同樣粗肥的胳膊，同樣完美的手術。</p>
<p>輪到職員種啦。在經理室裏進進出出，快得很，大約替小職員種痘又另用了一種簡便的手術？但總是一樣的種痘啊，不化錢。唔，不化錢？</p>
<p>可是有幾個就不樂意種，假裝到厠所裏去拉尿。</p>
<p>偏偏咱被副經理喚去種了，心兒裏老大的不愿意，可總不敢違拗上級的好意。在車間裏把長褂兒脫了，穿過長廊，穿過曠塲，冷是冷得要命。一分鐘後，咱就享受了不化錢種痘的權利。不過，在種的一刹那，醫生的鼻子起了異覺似的。這亦只能怪自己，兩禮拜沒洗浴，衛生衫，小褂子都髒透了。然而，沒工夫洗浴亦是實情，誰不歡喜淸潔呢？誰不講求衛生呢？但，亦要有講求淸潔和衛生的時間才得啊。</p>
<p>便帶着窘從經理室裏跑出來。</p>
<p>「陳先生，樂兒吧，女醫生替你種痘呢，哈哈！」十六號開車嘻皮笑臉地跟我打趣着。打趣，誰知咱肚子裏一胞氣。</p>
<p>職員完了，輪到工人咧。</p>
<p>阿保那小厮第一個跳進去，却馬上又被經理駡了出來，原因是沒除下頭上的那頂打鳥帽，太沒禮貌了。</p>
<p>「痛麽？」</p>
<p>「只像蚊蟲那麽一叮。」</p>
<p>「說是醫生，也那麽粗手粗脚地。」</p>
<p>「對咱們工人自然不客氣囉。」</p>
<p>………………………</p>
<p>男工種畢，輪到女工。</p>
<p>女工可沒有誰去，你想吧，呌娘兒們在經理室裏解衣褂，誰不害羞。結果，祇被喚去幾個幼小的姑娘。</p>
<p>醫生們走了，全廠種痘的十分之六，你望望我的胳膊，我望望你的胳膊，望出什麽來，還不是同樣兩條鮮血痕，沒有罩子，沒有紗布包，露着，給冷風吹着，給灰塵沾着。老王說：「種了痘子要吃鮮貨，吃鷄，越發得足越好。」廚子阿五說：「鷄是殺了一雙，二斤四兩重，不過，嘿嘿！是殺給經理娘娘吃的呢。」</p>

<h3>稿費生活</h3>
<p>— 施英</p>
<p>一九三四年一月八號的午後，時間是三點二十分。</p>
<p>在申報館二樓會計處的窗前，擁擠着稿費生活者之一羣，老的，少的，男的，女的。</p>
<p>會計處的窗，是一個小洞，恰像火車站上的售票處一樣，窗上冩着「……當面點淸，出門不認……」。窗裏面坐着那帶着眼鏡的職員，兩個，三個，四個，洋錢與算盤的聲音時刻由窗口飛到窗外。</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>我走去，人已經很多了，至少有十二三人。很快的，兩個聲音的對話飛過我的耳邊。</p>
<p>『老李，什麽時候來的？』</p>
<p>『我已經來了好久，我昨天來沒有領着。』</p>
<p>『然有幾篇？』</p>
<p>『三篇。』</p>
<p>『大槪有十多塊錢罷。』</p>
<p>『不知道，據說第一篇的錢要多些，我只有一篇登在頭上，前次我四篇，領到八塊四角錢。』</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>窗口有人離開了，是一個工人的模樣。被稱爲老李的馬上擠了上去。接着又由樓下走來了兩人。好幾個學生裝束的人在點頭，微笑，握手之中攀談起來了，新來的兩人作了談話的中心，他們談到稿費，談到文學，談到東方雜誌和中學生。談鋒到繚亂之中，又談到魯迅，茅盾，周瘦鵑和張恨水。｜｜這裏，是一個很短促的文藝茶會。</p>
<p>被稱爲老李的把投稿時的印鑑由窗口遞了進去，兩眼跟着會計員的兩手在移動。他底眼睛，從簿子上走到算盤上，然後走到鈔票上。最後錢是收到了，總數是五元二角。他遲疑了一會，似乎還想多拿點。</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>『老李！你又可以看兩回電影了。』一個笑聲。</p>
<p>『電影！這是吃飯的啊！』</p>
<p>老李走了，接着我就遞補上去。我的後面還有十幾個候補者，我剛走了出來，我心中就浮現出幾個大字：『啊！這是吃飯的啊！』</p>
<p>言論</p>
<h3>關於「我們的立國思想是什麽」的問題</h3>
<p>— 質平</p>
<p>在本刋第五十七期上，公樸君對我們提出了一個重要問题：「我們的立國思想是什麽？」我雖沒有「治國之才」，但也可算是國民中的一份子，也當本着「國家興亡，匹夫有責」之義來貢獻一點意見。</p>
<p>在一切混亂，一切皆不統一的中國，如果把「什麽是我們的立國思想」這問題提出來討論時，那便可以得到許多不同的回答：三民主義的立國思想，社會民主主義的立國思想　　西斯主義的立國思想，布爾　維克主義的立國思想，國家主義的立國思想……所有這些，都是這問題的具體答案。但是，問題是在這裏，在這一大批的答案中，何者是對的？卽何者能够建立中國，振興中國，配稱爲立國思想？</p>
<p>胡適博士曾經吿訴我們｜｜「多研究些問題，少談些主義」。我雖然不能苟同於這種「化整爲零」的辦法，但在這年頭裏，却也不敢信仰任何主義，更不敢在這下面來談論什麽。因此，我對於「我們的立國思想是什麽」這問題的回答，不能而且也不敢說什麽主義才配做我們的立國思想，我只有首先依照胡博士的辦法，在此提出目前中國的幾個根本問題來研究，並進而作問題的總解决。</p>
<p>第一，誰都知道，中國是半殖民地的國家，所有中國的經濟的，政治的權利，都爲帝國主義者所掌握。中國的窮困，中國的一切災難，都是帝國主羲者直接間接製造成的。所以中國不談立國則已，要談立國，就必須與帝國主義拚命，澈底廢除一切不平等條約，實行眞正的關稅自主，乃至根本推翻帝國主義對中國的統治，以爭取中華民族的完全獨立！</p>
<p>第二，中國土地問題的沒有解决，是農村經濟破產，社會不安，產業凋敝的主要原因。所以要使中國保有一個國家的常態，並與世界的先進國家並駕齊驅地向前發展，便必須澈底解决土地問題，安定農村，增加農村購買力，以繁榮整個的國民經濟。</p>
<p>第三，目前中國大多數的國民，都在失業，窮困，饑餓等等的威脅中，要中國配稱爲一個眞正文明的國家，首先就要澈底解决一切生產和分配的問題，根本消滅那些現象。</p>
<p>第四，在上面三個問題解决之下，才能談到發展中國產業，因而普及敎育，發展文化，使中國配稱爲現代的文明國家，洗去「一切落後」的恥辱。</p>
<p>以上四點，便是横在我們目前的大多數的同胞要求解决的中國社會的幾個根本問題。無論任何主義，只要能够解决這幾個根本問題的，便可作爲我們的立國思想。反之，不能解决這些根本問題，甚至阻碍這些問題解决的主義，便是亡國思想。</p>
<p>當然，無論什麽思想，主義，都必然是社會或人的集團的產物，都必須要人來實行，在一切主義的周圍，都是圍着許多人的。所謂能够解决目前中國的那些根本問題的主義，卽配稱爲我們的立國思想的，也必然要許多人來實行。在目前的中國，那些人能够執行這個呢？卽那些人纔是眞正具有那樣的立國思想，纔能眞正解决目前中國的那些根本問題呢？這我可不知道。不過，我想，大家如果不是健忘者，當會記得「九一八」以來，在中國一般國民中，那些是最能抗日反帝的，那些是最能爲目前中國的那幾個根本問題的解决而奮鬥的。</p>
<p>至於在目前的中國，那些書籍和刋物可以代表我們的立國思想，這也很難說，最好是請大家在上述那種原則下去觀察吧｜｜只要是爲那些能够解决目前中國的一切根本問題的大衆所擁護的，代表他們意識的，便是代表我們的立國思想的刋物或書籍。</p>
<p>業餘藝術</p>
<h3>民族主義的藝術與劇團</h3>
<p>— 一份子</p>
<p>許多人把藝術當作少數人的亨樂，但歷史吿訴我們，藝術也是人類爲了實際上需要而產生的。原始人爲了幫助他們的記憶，而發生文字和雕刻，爲了忘却勞作的疲勞，和使工作的節拍相合，音樂和詩歌可以說就是這樣脫胎，從最初的杭育聲，一直到現在。</p>
<p>每一個民族有牠那藝術的特殊成分。而這個别的特殊藝術，也就是各民族自己精神的營養，同時，民族的藝術也必然是民族的靈魂。這不是别的關係，一切種族，血統，生產方式以及地理的環境，就是構成特殊藝術的原因。</p>
<p>因此，在這個各民族你生我死的時代，我們必須抓住自己的民族藝術，發揚之，光大之，使成爲民族最巨大的推動力。</p>
<p>戲劇，在中國講起來，歷史也是很久的，元曲，崑曲，京劇，漢調，一直到蘇灘文明戲，………但這些東西，大半是「封建之餘孽」，我們自然不能拿來作爲民族的良好的營養，更談不到推動民族前進，所以，話劇運動的產生，實是新興文化的好現象。</p>
<p>戲劇，在一般藝術理論，被稱爲綜合的藝術，所以它是最合宜的大衆藝術。但過去一般新興戲劇的公演，不但十分貧弱，而且也只是一部份智識階級的玩意兒而已。我希望每一個劇團會成爲大衆的藝術團體，而用實來推進我們那日趨衰敗的老大民族。</p>

<h3>最後的命令</h3>
<p>— 傅伏生</p>
<p>广西桂林通訊</p>
<p>因爲我是智識份子的緣故，入營不到兩個月，便把我升爲中士班長；但當了班長，責任當然也加重了。例如一件小事，每餐分配小菜問題，一班十幾個人，廚房祇有一大碗菜，要再由我當班長的分給每一個人，我如果偶而分得不均匀，他們就怨聲嘖嘖，甚至要發生許多誤會來了。大約四五個月以前的時候，我們隊伍在××省邊境行進時，老百姓聞風逃走，而且把所有吃的用的東西也都帶着走了。我們因此一連幾天買不到米，祇好弄一點瓜菜芋頭之類東西煮着充饑。記得那個時候，我們營長的一匹馬病死了，丢棄在路旁，各連的人爲着爭這一匹病死的馬的肉吃，幾乎要開槍打起來。這足見對於吃的問題是何等的嚴重。再談到睡覺問題，那更是不堪聞問。常有睡在草坪或街簷下的時候，半夜三更，滂沱大雨，滿身淋漓，眞是　　不得。至若我們的官長，那情形又是兩樣了。從連部以上就都有小廚房，假如到了買不到吃的東西的地方，他們有的是罐頭食物；至若經過繁盛市鎭，他們總是鷄哪，魚哪，大吃大嚼。一般士兵，半年幾個月沒餉發，每月領到一二元零用錢，還是在伙食費内省出來的，那裏還有錢去圖口腹之樂呢。</p>
<p>以上所說的，是士兵生活苦况的一斑，以下要說到作戰時的情形了。</p>
<p>我自過着軍隊生活以來，參加正式戰鬥已有好幾次了。有一次，我們這一團被派作先鋒部隊，而我們這一連，又被輪到充當尖兵。在一個晨光　微搜索前進的時候，被敵人的前哨發覺了。敵人號兵吹着號詢問我們，我們就散開臥下，劈劈拍拍打起來了。還沒有到半小時之久，雙方火綫就展開在一哩以上，砲聲槍聲，震動得天崩地裂。這一塲戰鬥結果，我們弟兄死傷的在三百人以上，有的腦壳炸開了，有的肚腸破裂了，還有倒在地下，宛轉呻吟，要求補一槍以求速死的。還有一次，我們苦戰了一天一晚，陣綫沒有進展，雖師長迭次的下着『節省子彈，迅速前進』的命令，仍　　　有多人　　　効力。忽然師長到一個山頭上來了，嚴厲地叮囑我們的團長：『今晚八時，　綫總攻擊，大家定</p>

<p>一九三三年的總淸算（上）</p>
<h3>一九三三年國際政治的縮影</h3>
<p>— 羅傑女士</p>
<p>一九三三年是資本主義世界恐慌的第五年，在這一年中，全世界的帝國主義絞盡一切腦汁在實行着克服恐慌的一切方策：他們舉行了世界經濟會議，他們高築了關稅障壁，他們實行了通貨膨脹，他們高唱了「統制」經濟，他們提出了無數「復興」計劃。………然而，在「復興」，「統制」，關稅，貨幣的混戰中，恐慌是愈加深刻，愈加廣汎的發展下去：失業軍像洪水似的汎濫着，生產和消費的不平衡打破過去的紀錄，金融的混亂超過恐慌以來的各年度。</p>
<p>經這深廣的恐慌巨濤出發，展開着一九三三年緊張，危險，複雜，錯綜，萬花鏡似的國際政治：</p>
<p>第一，國際聯盟的破產｜｜帝國主義分贓會議國際聯盟，在帝國主義間衝突極端尖銳化，再分割殖民地的戰爭緊迫着來的一九三三年，已經再不能維持牠們表面的『聯盟』，實行散佈牠們的「和平」「恊助」的欺騙。日本帝國主義爲便利牠自己的獨占統治滿洲華北，連這表面的「束縛」也覺得有些討厭，首先撕破這紙糊的假面，『退出國聯』！英法意德的四强公約，雖然想和緩帝國主義在歐陸的衝突，加强反蘇聯的戰綫，然而依然不能遏止德帝國主義對國聯放出第二砲：『退出國聯』！這充分的說明，一九三三年中，帝國主義者已經不能進行『和平』的分贓，已經各自磨拳擦掌地在凖備進行第二次大厮殺的掠奪。</p>
<p>第二，帝國主義集團經濟的强化｜｜倫敦世界經濟會議之澈底的失敗，使各帝國主義的集團經濟（Bloc　Economies）更加强化。英美法日各擁其直接指揮之屬領殖民地與勢力圈，實行高建關稅壁壘，跌低外匯，而以貿易互惠保護自國商品的市塲，排除外國商品。用盡一切法　展開着世界市塲經濟戰的奇觀。這直接是軍事戰的序幕！</p>
<p>第三，帝國主義軍備競爭的激化：｜｜日内瓦軍縮會議之變成軍擴會議已經具體的說明了這個事實。德國之要求軍備平等，英日美法意之拚命擴充軍備，各帝國主義國家軍費預算之提高，以及軍事工業之空前的繁榮，又是這一事實之具體的左證。</p>
<p>第四，帝國主義政治法西斯蒂化的普遍｜｜希特拉在一九三三年的開頭掌握了德國的政權，現爲保持德國資本主義最後命運的支柱；日本統治階級之法西斯蒂化成爲遠東資本主義世界之最後看守，美國羅斯福之　　運動，各帝國主義之「統制經濟」實際上都是　　的法西斯蒂化的傾向。這更加使帝國主義間的衝突激化，對於勞動者與殖民地半殖民地的剝削壓迫加緊，面戰爭危機，革命危機　愈益緊迫了。</p>
<p>第五，世界反帝運動的高漲｜｜各帝國主義國家内的勞動階級反帝鬥爭在這一年中有着廣汎的發展。英國獨立工黨行動之趨於急進，美法意德及其他資本主義國家内勞動大家反資本主義反法西斯蒂統一運動之建立，便是具體的說明。此外，如古巴，邏羅的動亂，南美，非洲，印度等處革命運動的發展，在一九三三年中都有着顯著的現象。</p>
<p>第六，一九三三年的蘇聯｜｜一九三三年是蘇聯第二個五年計劃開始實行的第二年。蘇俄社會主義建設之着着進行，和平外交政策之着着成功：黑海，波羅的海沿岸諸國之多邊不侵犯條約的簽訂，中俄美俄之復交，在這一年的國際政治中堅立另一面的界碑。</p>
<p>一九三三年是資本主義世界一切帝國主義國家企圖聯合進攻蘇聯以解决自身間的矛盾而爲蘇聯的「和平政策」所擊破的一年；一九三三年是帝國主義間矛盾衝突激化，大家劍㧞弩張地凖備屠殺的一年，同時也就是帝國主義者加緊宰割世界大衆，凖備以他們作砲灰的一年。</p>
<h3>一九三三年的英日經濟戰</h3>
<p>— 魯小岱女士</p>
<p>英國是老牌的資本主義國家，是帝國主義的先輩，是世界上的最大貿易者。『英帝國無日落』，這意味着英帝國主義的殖民地的廣大，意味着英帝國主義世界市塲的寛闊，意味着英帝國主義的驕榮。</p>
<p>然而歐戰以後，美帝國主義的突飛猛進，在整個的世界市塲上，動搖了英帝國主義的地盤，這二三年來，新興日本帝國主義的飛躍，又給英帝國主義的主要市塲以嚴重的威脅。</p>
<p>日本帝國主義的主要輸出品是生絲，棉織品和人造絹。除生絲外，棉織品和人造絹都是英帝國主義的重要輸出品。這已經决定着英日帝國主義在世界市塲上的激烈的競爭。同時，日本帝國主義的棉織品人造絹的顧客，大部分是大英帝國的屬領殖民地。加之，因爲日本新進的生產技術與低廉的勞動力｜這意味着日本資本家對勞動者剝削的厲害｜使其成本比英國一般的爲輕；日金的暴跌使其在國外市塲佔着絶對的優勢；同時滿洲國的强佔更支持着日本帝國主義的腰脊，厲行對外的貶價販賣（傾銷）政策。於是日本的商品源源侵入英帝國的市塲，展開着一九三三年英日帝國主義决死的經濟戰！</p>
<p>英日經濟戰的主要戰野是印度，海峽殖民地，非洲，近東及中國。很明顯的，英帝國主義採取着艱苦的守勢，而日本帝國主義則取很猛烈的攻勢。</p>
<p>印度是英帝國主義的最大殖民地之一，也是英帝國主義的最大寳庫之一，然而在印度市塲上的英國商品，全部感受着日本商品的壓迫和極度的打擊，特别是英國棉布的頽勢更爲顯著。日本棉布之輸入印度的數量，已超過英本國輸入印度的數量。｜日本六億五千碼，英國祇六億碼。</p>
<p>在海峽殖民地，荷領東印度，土耳其及近東，埃及及其他非洲殖民地，同樣看見日本商品之進出，英國商品之衰頽。在澳洲及中國，英國商品雖顯露出發展的趨勢，然而日本商品依然像潮水似的奔入，特别是在中國北部與中部日本依然佔着壓倒的優勢。</p>
<p>全資本主義世界的恐慌，至一九三三年更見深刻與廣汛，目睹着海外市塲日趨狹隘的英帝國主義自然不能默爾而息，坐以待斃。於是動員全英帝國的領屬，繼續一九三二年六月渥太華會議的精神，實行向日本反攻，在印度，埃及，澳洲，海峽殖民地，和非洲其他屬領，高築關稅的障壁，提高傾銷稅，以防止日本商品之流入，而用特惠稅則維持英國的商品的地盤。</p>
<p>日本也不示弱，在英屬殖民地，特别是印度，提高關稅，廢棄日印商約的時候，日本的紡織資本家們便宣言抵制印棉；同時，在世界經濟會議裏，日本代表露骨的宣示抗英態度；更在日本經濟系列内實施對英國商品之報復關稅。</p>
<p>日英的經濟戰白𤍠化了！世界經濟會議沒有絲毫調劑的效力；日印西姆拉會議亦不能和緩牠們的衝突！</p>
<p>在中國，英帝國主義從香港展開牠的扇形，實行獨占華南的企圖，然而，日本商品仍不斷的向華南衝來；同時日本以滿洲國爲根據在華北展開更廣汎的扇形，華中長江一帶更爲英日角逐的地方，决鬥的所在。</p>
<p>英日帝國主義的經濟戰，很敏感的，必然地反映於外交戰上。世界經濟會議的破裂，日本的退出國聯，軍縮會議的擱淺，在在都表示着帝國主義間的矛盾衝突，而英日的對立也尖銳地顯露了出來。</p>
<p>一九三三年是英日經濟戰白𤍠化的一年，然而一九三三年的過去，並沒有把英日帝國主義間的矛盾衝突帶去，只有隨着一九三四年的到來而愈益加深！</p>
<p>資本主義内在的矛盾，宿命的使英日帝國主義者不能停息牠們的經濟有爭奪。牠們爭奪的結果是使資本主義世界的恐慌更加深刻，對各自國内的勤勞大衆的剝削更加增大，對各殖民地的壓迫更加殘酷！最後是從經濟戰轉化爲帝國主義間的軍事戰爭！</p>

<h3>他們的婚姻是永遠不會破裂的</h3>
<p>— 思瀛</p>
<p>大家都說他們的婚姻，不會永久的，但是他們却至今沒有一些破裂的朕兆，他們仍舊相親相愛著，愈久而愈堅。這在好萊塢的影界裏，差不多大家都認爲一個很奇怪的事。好萊塢的製造離婚的謠言家，亦無從施其技倆了。這二位是誰呢？就是安第福拉克（Ann　Dvorak）和勒斯利芬頓（Leslie　Fenton），亦不是寂寂無間的人物。安第福拉克最近曾在「戀愛之道」“The　Way　to　Lpqe”裏作主角。那張片子，本年是「蝴蝶夫人」主角雪爾徵薛妮（Sylvia　Sidney）主演的。她演了一半就不演了，於是公司方面就從華納兄弟公司將安第福拉克借了來做主角。這在安第福拉克方面，是一件很光榮的事。至於勒斯利芬頓，他也在德國做過許多大片子的主角，所以也不是毫無地位的人。</p>
<p>他們在結婚之前，大家都有一個　號。勒斯利呌「壞孩子」“Bad　Boy”而安呢？呌「怪女子“Wonder　Girl”他們兩個人，地位，思想。和年齡，沒有一處係相同的。他們的愛情，不過是一時的衝動，並沒有什麽深刻的情感。所以當他們將要宣吿訂婚的時候，安的母親，就恐怕他們的婚姻不能持久，所以她勸吿他們不要草率從事，至少要作朋友等待一年之久，安的母親自己亦是舞台上的人物，她深知婚姻與事業的難以而立，而尤其恐怕他們倆的羅曼絲的不能持久。一個老於世故的三十歲中年人，一個是入世未深，十九歲的妙齡女子。他們要是一旦脫輻，勒斯利可以捲捲舗蓋到不知什麽地方去了。</p>
<p>但是安第福拉克和好萊塢一般人的意見，並沒有阻止他們羅曼史的發展。他們起初因爲安的母親的勸吿，答應將一年的朋友試騐期，縮短到六個月。但是他們過了不到三個月，在一個心兒來潮的時候，竟雙雙携手跑到阿立桑那省的一個小地方去結婚了。他們結了婚，馬上就回到好萊塢工作。他們二人，日夜辛勤的工作了五個月，他們二人又在一個心血來潮的時候，離開了好萊塢。</p>
<p>他們在加利福尼亞省的聖彼得羅海港，坐了一隻船往南，經過巴拿馬運河往東，到了紐約。這件事會引起了好萊塢一時的轟動，因爲安第福拉克從好萊塢出走的時候，她的合同還沒有滿。幷且第二天，就要拍一張新片子一切都預備好了，但是到了第二天，安第福拉克已經不知去向了。他們從紐約又跑到歐洲，在英國遊歷了很久，又跑到德國。勒斯利芬頓在柏林拍了幾張片子。安第福拉克夫天天陪著她的丈夫拍戲，自已在好萊塢的合同，亦一槪置之腦後了。等到勒斯利的戲拍完了，他們又乘興暢遊歐洲南部，經過法國，意大利，地中海等地　到斐洲。他們眞是任性縱欲，爲所欲爲，一共暢快遊玩了九個月之久。最後他們坐了一隻小船回美國了。他們在海上飄流了四十八天之多。</p>
<p>但是他們這種遊歷，於他們的婚姻，是大有益處的，因爲他們已經這樣地跳出了好萊塢不良空氣的氛圍。他們已經由長期的旅行，使他們從普通愛情的結合，成了憂患相共，不可分離的伴侶了。他們回到好萊塢之後，他們所居的地方，他們日常的生活，一切都是超越於當地普通生活以上的。他們不喜社交，很少參加宴會。他們有他們兩個人刻劃出來的單獨生活，所以能絲毫不受一般謠言家謠諑的侵擾，他們的婚姻，能够永久維持其愉快，當然是有很充足的理由的。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「陳查禮巨探案」</h3>
<p>— 逸羣</p>
<p>Charlie　Chan’s　Greatest　Case</p>
<p>｜大上海映｜</p>
<p>大約在兩年以前吧，曾經有過一部什麽「陳查禮探案」來滬公映，記者雖未得觀究竟，但好像還依稀記得，它曾經轟動過一時，而且，似乎有許多人對於這一位偵探大王陳查禮先生，因爲他能代表中國人或者東方人，在異域大出風頭，揚眉吐氣，所以都着着實實地表示了一番敬意，至少都很滿意。所惜記者眼福太淺，至今猶有餘憾！</p>
<p>這一回，眞僥倖，不僅飽了眼福，而且還飽了耳福，兩年（？）來，念念悄忘的陳查禮先生的印象，有聲有色地映入了我的眼簾，襲入了我的内心！</p>
<p>和福爾摩斯探案一樣，陳查禮是小說中的偵探。本來，一個理想人物之國籍，可以由作者自由引用。現在我們所應當注意的却是作者的意識形態，他對於這位中國人，是怎樣理解和描冩的</p>
<p>這「陳查禮巨探案」，給予了我們一些什麽印像呢？却不禁感慨係之矣！</p>
<p>我們且撒開，現社會對於偵探的需要，和偵探對於現社會的任務，是否正確，這些問題，姑且不談。我們且承認劇作者的理想，是借着陳查禮的偵探術來攻擊現社會的所謂法律，所謂法律家，這一點，是有相當的意義，然而，這有什麽大的力量呢？還不是一個平凡的愛的糾紛的故事？平凡的愛的糾紛的故事，選取了這樣臆造的題材，其爲借題發揮的心理，眞是昭然若揭！暴露無遣！</p>
<p>現在我們再看劇作家是怎樣描中國人的陳查禮罷。</p>
<p>一，陳查禮是一個人，二，陳查禮的家庭，是猪玀一般地無秩序無條理，三，陳查禮的繁殖能力，多量生產，也和猪狗們一樣，四，陳查禮是吝嗇鬼，五，陳查禮努力探案的結果，是爲了一部新汽車，六，陳查禮是中國人……這些，不都很顯明地活現在書面上麽？陳查禮中國人，如此這般而已！</p>
<p>這並不是侮辱華人麽？在這裏，我們不能不佩服美國人的手腕！</p>
<h3>我們的啓事</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴摩爾</p>
<p>自有電影批評以來，使中國電影受着直接的影響，乃是無可否認的事實。因此，外間有許多傳聞，說有些電影企業家企圖從電影批評這方面謀取有利於電影的營業的方法等等。</p>
<p>我們二人，都是經常冩電影批評的，對於這種不良的現象，無論實有其事與否，却有說幾句話的必要。</p>
<p>我們始終要爭取自身的自由，我們决以公正的態度來維持自身的人格，我們决不受任何方面的威嚇與利誘，我們始終以最公正的言詞來批評中國電影作品。｜這是我們的誓言。敬請純良和善的讀者諸君嚴格的監視我們，批評我們，是所至感！</p>
<h3>卡爾登開映「吉地」</h3>
<p>天一影片公司有聲新片「吉地」，爲陳玉梅一九三三年主演聲片三部曲之一，由邵醉翁導演，田方，張振鐸，馬東武等合演，劇情描冩爲大衆利益而犠牲自己利益的靑年農人，及不爲環境屈服的鄕姑娘，同時對於破除迷信及發展農村水利敎育等，均有相當的啓示，片中穿揷，三齣平劇尤見精采，該片已定今日起在本埠卡爾登大戲院首次公映云。</p>
<p>左卽「吉地」中之一幕</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>「鹽潮」觀後感</h3>
<p>— 光斗</p>
<p>我們老早就渴望着的「鹽潮」的開映了。當然，不能否認這是一部極有意思的作品。但聽說：許多有力的地方，都爲電檢會當局剪掉，這是十分可惜的！於是剪剩的得公映的這些，不能深深的有力的印入我們的心坎了。不過給我們的印象，至少是忘不掉的。</p>
<p>如：鹽田第一步，第二步……鹽民工作的心苦。張德三被鹽警抓將官裏去。胡少爺的謀佔公地，斷了鹽民們的燃料。這都是能够使觀衆永遠不能忘記的</p>
<p>土豪們的壓迫弱小的鹽民，還缺乏有力的描冩，以及鹽民們的反抗，也不大有力。總而言之，這是剪剩的殘片，還能有這樣的意識，是値得一看的了。（缺章却酬）</p>
<h3>「鹽潮」我感</h3>
<p>— 喻比</p>
<p>「鹽潮」是本年度明星公司第一次的貢獻。</p>
<p>本片的劇情是吿訴我們鄉村姑娘的「活潑」，「天眞」，土豪劣紳的鬼計多端，「陰險巨猾」，老鹽民的「忠摯」可靠，誠實「純厚」，公子哥兒的風流，「淫佚，」鄕村鹽民的「勇敢」鬥爭，及「團結」力的勝利。</p>
<p>導演在本片中他吿訴我們些什麽？他用了全力來指摘製鹽鄕民的「辛苦」，土豪劣紳「剝削」鹽民的手段，技巧上也有了相當的成功，比較已往的成績，已有了驚人的進步；但是小疵點總免不了，如「阿鳳」的你親因燒私鹽的「嫌疑」而被拘，可是沒說出燒私鹽的原因。</p>
<p>旣然「阿鳳」討厭「心吾」，爲何又答應「心吾」同去上海呢？這不是「阿鳳」的心理太「矛盾」了嗎？</p>
<p>演員如胡蝶的「阿鳳」，當「心吾」去誘感她的時候，一付莊嚴的態度，値得我們贊許。王徵信的表情，又是本片中成功的一個，顧梅君的表情和胡蝶一樣的活潑，嬌憨，孫敏的表情也使我們滿意，王獻齊，王夢石都有良好的表情。</p>
<h3>電影小說歌壇雙絶The　Cat　and　the　Fiddle(五)</h3>
<h3>墨塵</h3>
<p>先莉回到家裏，拿這件事講給維克多聽了。維克多正默默地對着那座鋼琴深思着。他聽了先莉的話，無精打彩地說道：「那有什麽用呢？我的小歌劇還沒有完成呢。我在這里亦完成不了，我已經試了多少次了。」先莉道：「你不喜歡這個地方嗎？」維克多連忙掩蓋道：「這個地方很好呀。」但是先莉已看出來了。她說：「我知道你不喜歡這個地方。」她都要哭出來了，但是她竭力自己鎭壓着，過了一回她說道：「好吧，心肝，我們到别的地方去吧……到一個你能靜心工作的地方……唔，我想着了……我們先結婚。然後我們到利維拉去度蜜月去。那時候祇有我陪着你……沒有别的人，你亦可以工作，完成你的小歌劇了。」她說完了，又興高彩烈起來。</p>
<p>維克多拉了她的手，在嘴唇上吻着。他低低地喊着：「寳貝，我實在想不出世界上再有什麽事比做你的丈夫更好的了。我做了你的丈夫，天天快活死了。我頂不願意的，是永遠做你的客，你知道嗎？」他替她拭去急速的淚珠，繼續着說道：「照現在說起，一切我吃的，一切我穿的，連這個地方，統通是你的。」先莉說：「不是我們同意過，永遠作伴侶，平分一切的幸運的嗎？」維克多自怨自艾道：「那是不差的，但是呌我拿什麽東西來和你分呢？難道拿窮來和你分嗎？」先莉問道：「你不是想回布魯塞爾去嗎？」維克多說那是他以前開始工作的地方。先莉道：「好極了，我們回布魯塞爾去，我們仍舊住在那所舊房子裏。那不是很有趣的嗎？」維克多想起了從前的一切，心裏快活得一時說不出話來。他祇在她的唇上頻頻的吻着，吿訴她她已經使他快活得無以復加了。</p>
<p>這時樓下賓客已經雲集，維克多興怱怱地下來接待着賓客。他因爲快活得忘其所以了，所以下樓的時候，嘴裏還哼着“Hi　diddle　dididle……The　cat　and　the　lio　　　……The　cow　jumped　over　the　moon”……奥黛蒂聽見了，她拉着她丈夫的道：「親愛的，你聽聽那支歌多末有意思呀！你信不信，我唱着那歌，又要轟動一時了」她於是亦跟着‘Hi　diddle　diddle’的哼了起來。維克多在旁邊解釋道：「這支歌還沒有完成哩，不過亦快了。我們就要回布魯塞爾去了。先莉同我一齊去……再過了幾個月……」</p>
<p>「維克多！」道達急急忙忙從外面趕了進來。他一方面對着奥黛蒂鞠躬道歉，一方面對着維克多道：「我有一句話和你講。」他們兩個人於是一同到了一個角落裏。道達很和氣的拿出烟盒出來向維克多讓着。維克多道：「謝謝，我不吸烟。你有什麽話請說吧。」道達說道：「那是爲先莉的事。你太對不起她了。她吿訴我她要和你一同回到布魯塞爾去，是不是？」維克多說：「是的。」（未完）</p>

<p>Opinions of the Diplomatic Authorities</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign news: Foreign Minister Wang, who also serves as Foreign Minister, received a reply from the Japanese Ambassador to China, Arata Ariyoshi, regarding a letter stating that Japanese residents in Fuzhou could not be relocated. He intends to no longer express any further opinion because British and American residents in Fuzhou have already been completely relocated. If Japanese residents still remain, our country will definitely not abandon its claim to eradicate the rebel army within the country. However, within the possible scope, we will bear the responsibility of protecting foreign nationals. If foreign nationals suffer unintentional losses due to our military actions, we will handle them in the same way as protecting our own people or provide appropriate compensation. The proposal initiated by the Consular Corps in Fujian to designate the Cangqian Mountain area of Fuzhou as a neutral zone cannot be accepted. If the Japanese navy in Fujian uses the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese and the Marine Corps actually lands, our diplomatic authorities will definitely negotiate based on international law because the past Jinan Incident also occurred because the Japanese army used the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese. Therefore, the Japanese side's pretext of protecting overseas Chinese this time must be treated with extreme caution in advance. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Xiang Hanping has decided to return to his ancestral home in Hepu within the next few days to recuperate. His wife, son-in-law, and others passed through Hong Kong from the province on the 13th and took a ship to leave first. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Guangdong Province is currently strictly defending against an attack from the Fujian army, fearing that the Nineteenth Route Army and communist troops will flee into Guangdong after being defeated by the Central Army. Therefore, the Guangdong authorities have stepped up efforts to strengthen the border. Troops have been added to the Dongjiang area and areas close to Fujian Province. The defense forces have been ordered to repel any Fujian army that attacks. According to Chinese newspapers, the authorities have sent two divisions of troops to the border of Fujian Province. It is reported that the First Independent Division and the Fifth Division have occupied Pinghe, Yongding, Yunxiao, Shanghang, and Wuping. Government officials have confirmed that the Fujian authorities have gathered vehicles to transport military and government personnel to Zhangzhou, and they intend to abandon eastern Fujian and retreat to southern Fujian and northern Guangdong. Therefore, the authorities have increased the defense of northern Guangdong. Chen Jitang, seeing the increasingly unfavorable situation in Fujian, has strictly ordered all troops on the front lines and troops in northern Jiangxi to actively prepare to prevent any unexpected events.

<h3>Chen Yi Pays Respects to Lin Sen and Wang Jingwei to Request Instructions on the Post-War Situation in Fujian, Will Assume His New Post in Fujian Immediately After Meeting Chiang</h3>

The candidates for the members of the provincial government and the heads of various departments will be discussed and announced at the Executive Yuan meeting next Tuesday. It is heard that Chen intends to go to Hangzhou first to discuss measures for Fujian Province before going to Yanping to organize the provincial government. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Yi paid respects to Chairman Lin on the morning of the 13th to request instructions on Fujian's administration. He will also go to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek within the next few days to request instructions before going directly to Fujian to assume his new post. The successor candidate for military affairs has already been internally decided and will be announced in three days. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Yi told reporters from the Central News Agency on the 13th that he would go to Fujian to take up his new post after Deputy Minister Cao returns to Nanjing or the successor Deputy Minister arrives. The members of the provincial government and the heads of various departments who did not defect will generally be reappointed. He himself is a pragmatist and intends to start with protecting the people and maintaining order in administration. He will select outstanding individuals to serve as county magistrates. The military situation in Fujian will soon come to an end. The rebellion was short and had little impact, so post-war management will be easy. Xiamen and Fuzhou have a mixed population of Chinese and foreigners, and the national army should fulfill its responsibility to protect foreign nationals and prevent misunderstandings in diplomacy. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Yi told people that he had no prior knowledge of being ordered to govern Fujian this time, so he was not prepared for reforms. All measures are being discussed with Chairman Lin and President Wang and will be finalized in three or four days. As the unrest in Fujian has not been quelled, construction cannot yet be discussed. He intends to actively reorganize the recaptured counties to restore normalcy. The number of accompanying personnel will be no more than one or two. It is heard that Chen Jinglie, a military department advisor, will accompany him. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Sun's Troops Telegraph to Report on Troop Movements</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Military news: Sun Dianying sent a telegram to the authorities yesterday reporting on troop movements, stating that his troops were stationed in the Wuyuan and Linhe areas, which were overcrowded and suffering from hunger and cold. He consulted with the Shanxi-Suiyuan authorities and allocated barren land in the two counties of Woye and Linhe for his troops to cultivate in order to alleviate overcrowding and engage in canal construction and farming. However, there are few houses in Woye, and barracks need to be built. He has ordered his Deputy Army Commander Yu to lead six regiments of cavalry and infantry to Woye on the 12th. In addition to telegraphing Chairman Ma for reference to avoid misunderstandings, he is hereby reporting. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's representative, Hu Jiesan, said that Sun Dianying went from Baotou to Linhe to inspect his troops and did not advance west. The headquarters of the 41st Army also arrived in Linhe. Ma Hongbin is in the Jinji defense area of Ningxia and has not yet arrived at Sanshenggong to meet with Sun. However, there is a car road from Jinji to Sanshenggong, and it can be driven in two days. A portion of the vanguard of our army is in the Sanshenggong area in Ningxia, and a portion is east of the river. Because our army is heading to Woye, it would be much easier to pass through the west bank of the Yellow River, but before Sun meets with Ma, the troops west of the river will not move forward for the time being. A portion of the troops east of the river has already moved towards Woye. Huo Fengnian's troops are still stationed in Baotou. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<h3>The Date for Puyi's Usurpation of the Throne is Confirmed as March 1st, Hishikari Secretly Discusses Measures with Zheng Xiaoxu, The Japanese Government Recommends Qingpu as Puyi's Tutor</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Zheng Xiaoxu went to the "Executive Government" yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to meet with Puyi, the Head of Government, and presented the petitions and suggestions from the governors and special mayors of Jilin, Fengtian, Heilongjiang, and Xing'an provinces, which varied in form. Puyi declared that he would remain in "Manchukuo" permanently, and the grand ceremony of "Manchukuo" was confirmed to be held on March 1st. (Dentsu News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Hishikari, Commander of the Kwantung Army, visited Zheng Xiaoxu, a rebel of the "Manchukuo" State Council, at 10:40 AM this morning to discuss the issue of Puyi's claim to the throne and the second Japan-Manchukuo Protocol (the pseudo-country's contract to sell itself as a protectorate of Japan), and held secret discussions for over an hour before leaving. (Hualian News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) After Puyi ascends the throne, he plans to use the orchid as the coat of arms (i.e., a special symbol) on the imperial palace and imperial flag. Puyi's move is imitating the Japanese Emperor's round chrysanthemum as a coat of arms. The Japanese Emperor has been using it from ancient times to the present, generation after generation. Our country, except for a very short period during the Zhou Dynasty when coats of arms were used, has not adopted them. (Hualian News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The "Manchukuo" government is scheduled to announce important events on the 20th of this month. Currently, the movement to support Puyi as Emperor is fierce, and all parties are paying attention to its content. (Japan United News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the request of "Manchukuo," the Japanese government is currently considering a tutor for Puyi, the Head of Government. They must have experience as a prime minister or government speaker. Currently, the only person who meets these qualifications is Count Kiyoura Keigo. Although Count Kiyoura is 85 years old, he is still energetic. When Puyi was living in seclusion in Tianjin, Count Kiyoura visited him and is also a friend of Zheng Xiaoxu. Therefore, if the Manchukuo government insists, he may come forward to serve. (Dentsu Telegraph on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) It is now known here that Puyi will ascend the throne on March 1st and claim the title of Emperor. It is believed that the cabinet system currently used will still be maintained in the imperial constitution, but the power of cabinet members will be greatly expanded, and central power will be further consolidated. Its internal reform plan may contain the following aspects: (1) Abolish Japan's consular jurisdiction in Manchuria; (2) Divide the current five provincial administrative regions into eighteen regions; (3) Revise the tax system and implement economic and financial reforms; (4) Judicial independence; (5) Redefine foreign policy and enhance friendship with all countries; (6) Sign a new Japan-Manchukuo Protocol. It is also heard that the "Manchukuo" embassy in Tokyo will probably be upgraded to an embassy, and Chen Ruilin (transliteration), the acting director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, is said to be the first ambassador. The new constitution is currently being drafted in Tokyo by Zhao Xinbo, but it is not yet known whether the draft can be completed as soon as possible and implemented on March 1st. However, Lieutenant General Koiso predicted that this work would take two or three years. As for the enthronement plan, it is still being kept secret, and there will definitely be a spectacle of various kinds at that time. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<h3>After Overcoming Fuzhou, [Regarding] 元</h3>
<p>This campaign to conquer Fujian: Yanping was captured, Gutian was taken, Xiamen was recovered, and now there is even talk of the navy conquering Fuzhou. Whether this is true remains to be seen, but the expectation is likely not far off. However, after Fuzhou is conquered, will the military campaign conclude there, or will the victory be used to advance and quell the entire province's Fujian army? As we see it, the military action may conclude there. Why? Because this military campaign in Fujian province is different from other internal wars. It is a so-called "last resort." Using military force as a last resort only seeks to subdue them and stop there. It is a so-called "compassionate restraint, not rejoicing," unlike other wars to seize cities and land. Capturing a city and gaining a territory is not to show off the strength of our military power, boast about the glory of our military achievements, and take advantage of the victory to advance until everything is as we desire. At the beginning of the Fujian Incident, the 19th Route Army relied on the battle of January 28th, thinking they could get lucky once again. Now that they have suffered this major blow, it is only natural that they will become aware and develop a sense of regret. At this point, the central government should stop at the appropriate time, giving them an opportunity to repent and avoid pursuing them like cornered bandits. Since the use of military force was a last resort, if there are other ways to resolve the matter besides military force, then we should seek them through other means. Moreover, there are many disputes regarding political issues in addition to military matters, and they cannot all be resolved by military force. Therefore, the Fujian campaign must begin with military force but end with peace. Furthermore, we have something more to say: the outbreak of this Fujian Incident is just one issue among many. If the central government can handle this Fujian Incident appropriately, it can reduce the discontent and resentment of others who are dissatisfied with the central government. We say this not because the central government's military victory this time is enough to subdue them, but because the central government can take this opportunity to resolve the Fujian affair and implement its stated commitment to unity and transparency in everything. According to reports, central figures have consistently expressed a willingness to fully accept the Southwest's demands and Mr. Hu Hanmin's eight proposals. If the authorities genuinely and thoroughly demonstrate this desire for openness as the Fujian affair comes to a close, making it clear to all parties that the government is not biased towards any one party and genuinely intends to recruit talents from outside the party, then success will be easier than when the Fujian Incident first broke out. Why is this so? Because if we talked about cooperation and unity when the Fujian Incident first broke out, people would suspect that the central government was forced to do so because it had no other choice, and that it might not be genuinely sincere in cooperating and uniting. After the recovery of Fuzhou, people will suspect that the central government will suddenly change its face because of its military victory, cancel its previous intentions for unity and cooperation, and replace it with an authoritarian attitude. Although this kind of speculation is close to judging a gentleman with the heart of a petty person, it is still within the realm of general human nature. Now, if the central government can demonstrate, after its military victory, that the use of military force was a last resort, and quickly use peaceful means to resolve the Fujian situation, without prolonging the disputes and causing the people to suffer more from the pain of war, and at the same time sincerely adhere to the original intention of cooperation and unity, earnestly seeking a way to save the country with the Southwest and making the path public to show the way of impartiality and selflessness, then people's previous suspicion that the central government had no other choice and only spoke of cooperation and unity can be dispelled. The later suspicion that the central government would rely on its victory and only advocate military force can also be completely resolved. This is why we say that success will be easier.</p>
<p>Alas, the affairs of the country are difficult, and have reached an extreme. The people who hold the reins of power, a single thought, a single action, affects the whole country. Mussolini, Hitler, and others were able to endure hardships and cope with changes in the world because of their sincere intentions, which inspired their people to move towards spiritual unity. The world has never seen a country that can face external challenges when it is not united internally, nor has it seen a country that can unify its people by relying solely on military force. As the Fourth Plenary Session is about to open, our government should quickly rise up and address this.</p>
<h3>Xia Ziming's Troops Arrive in Xuanhua and Return to Qin Dechun's Command, To Be Reorganized; Liu Guitang Leads Remnants Back to Qingliu and Shen County</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After Xia Ziming led his troops to break away from Liu Guitang, on the 9th of this month, all of them arrived in Xuanhua as ordered to await orders. Xia's troops still have two infantry regiments, mostly elite troops from Liu's army, with well-equipped firearms. Song Jue decided to assign these troops to Qin Dechun for command. Qin plans to return to Chahar in two or three days and will inspect the troops in a special train in Xuanhua to reorganize them. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the bandit Liu's troops fled south from the suburbs of Beiping to southern Hebei, a portion of them gathered in Gu'an, along with more than a thousand local bandits, totaling more than two thousand, and occupied Shuangtang Town east of Xincheng. Another group of seven or eight hundred fled to Kougang Town southwest. Most of them fled into Ba County on the morning of the 5th of this month, crossed Xincheng again, and fled south to Xiong County. On the 8th, they crossed the river at Niangniang Temple southeast of Xiong County and fled to Liangzhaoying northeast of Renqiu. Because He Zhuguo and Xu Tingyao's armies were stationed south of the Pinghan Railway, with strong forces, the bandits did not succeed, so on the 10th, they turned south to the Jinpu Railway, attempting to escape back to their old nest in Shandong Province. After Han's troops intercepted them, a portion of them dispersed into Shandong Province. Liu himself led two thousand bandits and retreated to Qingyuan and Shen County in southern Hebei on the 12th, planning to flee to Henan Province via southern Hebei. He Zhuguo's troops stationed in southern Hebei have dispatched teams to actively pursue and suppress them. At the same time, Pang Bingxun and other troops stationed in northern Henan are also preparing to intercept them. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>

Cui Erdan's nephew, Bangjie, serves as a brigade commander in Liu's army. Bangjie had contacted Erdan beforehand. Liu's attempt to flee to western Henan this time is to join forces with Erdan. After the Hebei authorities received the report, they dispatched teams to strictly guard the Daming area and telegraphed Liu Zhi to prevent the troops from crossing the river. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu stated that Liu Guitang's troops once fled to the junction of Daming and Pu County yesterday. Because the provincial army blocked them, they have now fled back to the vicinity of Daming. Hengshui and Xian County still have remnants. He has now appointed a certain division commander as the commander of the western Shandong garrison, leading troops to prevent them. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han stated that Shandong Province has strictly prevented Liu Guitang from fleeing south. Zhan Shutang's division opened Pu County Guancheng. Li Hanzhang's division and the second route of the cavalry regiment, the Ru regiment, are in charge of northern Shandong. The Yellow River has not yet frozen, and the boats are all on the south bank. It is difficult for Liu's troops to fly across. He has no need to go to northern Shandong for the time being. He also telegraphed both Chairmen Yu and Liu that Liu's troops have no territorial restrictions. Zhan's division has already crossed the river west from Changqing. Also, the people in Jing County, Nangong, and Zaoqiang are fleeing to Dezhou. Liu's troops are still in Wuyi and Hengshui. Liu himself is in Heng. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Xia Ziming led his troops to break away from Liu Guitang, he has been ordered to arrive in Xuanhua. Xia's troops still have two infantry regiments, and the firearms are quite well-equipped, making them the elite of Liu's troops. Song Zheyuan decided to assign these troops to Qin Dechun for command. Qin will return to Chahar in the coming days and will disembark in Xuanhua to inspect them in order to reorganize them. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Finance Will Continue to Discuss Ways to Recover Merchant Stock Advances from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (Nanjing)</h3>
<p>According to the Ministry of Communications, when the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company initially recovered merchant stocks, the company's funds were insufficient, so Zhu Jiahua of the Ministry of Communications and former Minister of Finance Song Ziwen agreed that the Central Bank would advance funds for recovery. It was also decided that the advanced funds did not need to be repaid by the company in order to expand shipping services. However, in December of last year, the Central Bank suddenly demanded repayment of the advanced funds from the company. The company then submitted a report to the Ministry and the Executive Yuan, requesting that all advanced funds be allocated to the company as capital. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan handed the matter over to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications for consultation. After one meeting, the issue remained unresolved. The Ministry of Communications intends to request the government to approve the allocation of 15 million from the National Economic Council's capital to the company, with the Ministry of Finance deducting the amount advanced by the Central Bank to complete the formalities.

<p>(Nanjing) Government officials have launched a campaign to establish an altar to commemorate the Dalai Lama after the Panchen Lama arrives in Beijing. The original plan was to set up the altar on Binhua Mountain, but it was decided to choose a large temple in Beijing because it was too far away.

<h3>Japanese Fish Illegally Branded, Agitating American Boycott</h3>
<p>Foreign Goods with Blue Eagle Logo Prohibited from Import</p>
<p>(Washington) The Treasury Department today ordered customs to refuse entry to foreign goods bearing the Blue Eagle logo. This move was apparently triggered by the customs' discovery of 4,000 boxes of Japanese tuna bearing the Blue Eagle logo. (Reuters dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the very low Japanese exchange rate, Japanese goods are flowing into the American market like a tide. Among them, matches, pencils, light bulbs, rubber boots, cotton yarn, cloth, and canned goods are the most numerous. American industrialists are suffering a lot and are trying to stop Japanese goods. Coincidentally, Japanese merchants have actually counterfeited American trademarks and smuggled a large number of canned fish, which has added fuel to the fire and agitated Americans to boycott Japanese goods. It is rumored that the United States will use the National Industrial Recovery Act to prohibit the import of Japanese goods and use Russia's competition with Japanese cotton yarn and cloth in Manchuria and mainland China. Japanese merchants are trying their best to deny counterfeiting and smuggling canned fish to prevent the American boycott. (United Press dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia's Purge</h3>
<p>300,000 People Expelled from the Party</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian Communist Party's annual purge campaign ended today. A total of 300,000 people were expelled from the party this year, accounting for about 16% of the total party membership. The motive for this harsh measure is that the party's members are too complicated. Many party members do not have Bolshevik beliefs and have violated party rules, resisted the current government, or engaged in immoral and corrupt behavior. The regions where the purge was implemented most severely are the Far East and Siberia. (National Telegram on the 12th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Hegemonic Ambitions: Preparing to Withdraw from the Naval Treaty to Lay the Groundwork for Demanding a Change in Ratios; the United States Opposes, Having Already Expressed Various Views; After Ten Years of Peace, a Great Storm Will Be Stirred Up Again; the Situation in the Pacific Will Cause Disputes Between Italy and France</h3>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, the Japanese government plans to comply with the provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty and issue a two-year advance notice of withdrawal from the treaty. This is because Japan is determined to expand its navy, roughly intending to make its strength equal to that of Britain and the United States. (National Telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department and the Navy Department stated today that the US government was not surprised to hear that Japan intended to terminate the Washington Naval Limitation Treaty. Washington has not yet received an official statement on this matter, but messages received last year have confirmed that Japan intends to demand an increase in its naval ratio after 1936. Japan wants its fleet to be equal to that of Britain and the United States, instead of the 5:5:3 ratio. The US government has long regarded it as a major issue to be discussed at the 1935 Naval Limitation Conference. Japan's notice of intention to terminate the treaty two years later is to prepare the ground for making demands when the conference is convened in 1935 to discuss the continuation or amendment of the treaty. Washington has already expressed various views that the United States is determined to oppose Japan's increasing its naval ratio. The reason is that Japan's navy does not need to be equal as long as the Pacific trust territories are not fortified and cannot be used to attack Japan. Several senior naval officers, especially those of the big navy faction, were quite pleased to hear the news that Japan would issue the notice, believing that this would provide a better opportunity to request huge sums of money to build warships and aircraft in the next two years. General observers see Japan's proposed notice to abolish the treaty as a major issue for the navy. After ten years of naval peace, there will be more troubles from this. They are deeply afraid that the situation in the Pacific may become a major issue for France and Italy to disagree on naval equality. (National Telegram on the 13th)</p>
<h3>British Naval and Air Force Exercises in Scottish Waters Emphasize Hong Kong's Defense</h3>
<p>(London) The British Navy recently held exercises in the northern waters of Scotland, simulating an enemy attack on the Moray Firth from the Baltic Sea. The Navy and Air Force cooperated in the defense, and the results of the exercises have been reported. Several points are of great interest, as the strategic situation of the Moray Firth is similar to that of Hong Kong. When it is attacked from the Baltic Sea, it awaits reinforcements from the mainland, just as Hong Kong awaits reinforcements from Singapore when attacked from the East. Moreover, Britain recently sent the cruiser "Adventure" to Hong Kong, and Hong Kong has established a volunteer reserve air force, indicating that the lessons learned from the Moray Firth exercises are highly relevant to Hong Kong's defense.

<h3>Regarding Japan as a Hypothetical Enemy, the Soviet Far East Air Force Makes Rapid Advances, Approaching the Level of Advanced Aviation. Brief Overview of the Performance of Three Types of Aircraft</h3>
<p>According to Japanese news, regarding Japan as a hypothetical enemy, the Soviet Union has been focusing on strengthening its Far East military since the Manchurian Incident. By using the Maritime Province as a base, Japan's Sakhalin, Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, and Korea are all within bombing range, which they consider to be a valuable asset. In their war plan against Japan, they have adopted an air force-centric strategy, creating a vast air fleet to compensate for the inferiority of their navy. According to recent information received by the Japanese military, the Soviet Air Force has made extraordinary progress. The number of imported goods rapidly declined in 1933, and in 1934, the first line of the Soviet Air Force was equipped with sophisticated, purely domestically produced military aircraft, which is a noteworthy fact. Particularly noteworthy is that the performance of these domestically produced, first-line military aircraft, divided into bombers, fighters, and reconnaissance aircraft, has improved remarkably, approaching the level of advanced aviation countries such as Britain, France, and Germany. The performance of the three types of aircraft is briefly outlined below:</p>
<h3>TB-2 Heavy Bomber</h3>
<p>This aircraft is designed with the goal of actively attacking Japan, with a particular emphasis on range. It can carry 16 personnel and is equipped with four domestically produced M-17 600-horsepower engines. The maximum speed is 240 kilometers per hour, and the endurance is 14 hours. It has excellent performance. If it were to attack Tokyo from Vladivostok, it could reach Tokyo airspace in five hours, with approximately five hours of bombing and aerial combat capability remaining.</p>
<h3>I-7 Fighter</h3>
<p>This is an improved version of the Soviet Air Force's elite I-5 from last year. It has a speed of 300 kilometers per hour and is equipped with a domestically produced M-22 700-horsepower engine. The maximum speed is actually 305 kilometers per hour. It can fly between Tokyo and Osaka in one hour. As a fighter emphasizing speed, it can be considered the world's best.</p>
<h3>R-6 Reconnaissance Aircraft</h3>
<p>This aircraft is a two-seater equipped with a domestically produced M-34 800-horsepower engine. The maximum speed is 240 kilometers per hour, and the endurance is approximately seven hours. Its value in aerial combat as a medium-range reconnaissance aircraft is the focus of attention from all parties. (World News Agency)</p>
<h3>Stalin Discusses with American Reporter the Greatest Crisis Between Soviet Russia and Japan, the Responsibility Lies Entirely with the Japanese Military Clique</h3>
<p>Moscow - Joseph Stalin, General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, who holds the entire political power of Soviet Russia, recently made the following important remarks to the Moscow correspondent of the New York Times:</p>
<p>The restoration of diplomatic relations between Soviet Russia and the United States opens a path for mutual cooperation, which is most gratifying politically and economically. Soviet Russia can import more foreign goods, but it is unwilling to issue orders if it cannot afford to pay. Therefore, we do not want to import foreign goods on one side without being able to export our goods on the other. We will not stop paying. As with other countries, some say that Soviet Russia has no ability to pay, which is a big mistake, because we have never stopped paying.</p>
<p>Our most ardent wish is to maintain friendship with Japan, but we cannot do this alone. As long as Japan adopts a friendly policy towards Soviet Russia, cooperation between the two countries will not be a problem. However, we deeply worry that the Japanese military clique will oppose a friendly policy, which is the greatest crisis between the two countries.</p>
<p>We do not want the crisis to come, but we cannot but prepare to deal with it. If a country is exposed to danger and its government does not try to defend itself, it will inevitably be abandoned by the people. We do not think it wise for Japan to attack us. Japan's economic situation is not very favorable. It has "Manchukuo" and China as its neighbors, but if it goes to war with Soviet Russia, which country will be its backer? A good soldier is not always a good economist.</p>
<p>We expect to eventually conclude a trade agreement with Britain, but under the current circumstances, whether it can be concluded soon is a question.</p>
<p>Italy has not made any proposals to us regarding the reorganization of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia's biggest problem at present is to improve its system of supplying goods to cities and villages, and to improve its transportation system, especially the railways. These problems are not easy to solve, but since we have overcome even greater difficulties in the past, we are confident that we can eventually solve these difficulties in the future. The problem of industrialization has now been solved, and the problem of collective agriculture has also been solved. The only problems that remain to be solved are to improve the system of supplying goods and the transportation system. (World News Agency)</p>

<h3>French Senate Discusses Foreign Policy Issues</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Senate met today to discuss foreign policy issues. Senator Ambrest spoke, saying that France has always trusted international treaties, but now it is disappointed. The sacrifices France has made to Germany have also been in vain. France originally had infinite hope for the League of Nations, but Germany turned its back on it, and Italy attacked it as well. In addition, the Locarno Treaty has been abandoned, and the Four-Power Pact is intended by Mussolini as a tool to revise the peace treaties, which is extremely dangerous in nature. As for the Disarmament Conference, it has failed to disarm and has instead become a conference for controlling rearmament. Reymilly then gave a speech recounting the history of diplomacy after the European War, stating, "Germany is determined to remove all restraints. We must not reduce the country's strength again this time." He concluded, "France should no longer adopt a labor-saving policy. The people should strictly observe discipline and fulfill their obligations. The government should lead the people to enter this path," and so on. Next, Poulet addressed the meeting, first saying that Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour's unwillingness to greatly reform the League of Nations was very satisfying. He then said that the Four-Power Pact was a good thing because it eased the atmosphere between the two countries. Finally, he said that Britain cannot remain isolated. Senator Hubert then spoke, saying that the alliances created by the European War should not be abandoned and that all misunderstandings that may arise should be eliminated. The meeting was then adjourned, to be continued next Tuesday. (Havas, 12th)</p>

Foreign Secretary Simon reported on the progress of the Paris and Rome talks and listened to the recent report of the British Ambassador to France, Phipps. Today, Prime Minister MacDonald decided to convene a Cabinet meeting next Tuesday to continue discussing disarmament issues. It is generally expected that the Cabinet will discuss Germany's reply to France and the possibility of talks between the two countries. Britain will likely only step in to mediate when the Franco-German negotiations reach a stalemate. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Approves Alcohol Tax Bill</h3>
<p>△ Annual Revenue Increase of 500 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Another Step in the Government's Financial Policy</p>
<p>Preparing to Take Over Gold Reserves from Reserve Banks</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today approved the alcohol tax bill. This bill stipulates that distilled spirits will be taxed at two dollars per gallon, beer at five dollars per barrel, and other alcoholic beverages at four cents to forty cents per gallon, depending on the alcohol content. Beverages with an alcohol content exceeding 24 percent will be treated as distilled spirits and taxed at two dollars per gallon. It is estimated that this bill will generate 500 million yuan in revenue annually. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is still unknown what actions President Roosevelt will take regarding gold in the future. Attorney General Cummings has presented to the President his opinion on whether the government can immediately take over the gold reserves of the Federal Reserve without waiting for Congress to pass a bill. Judging from the situation, President Roosevelt seems to want to take over the reserves of the various Reserve Banks so that the gold surplus denominated in dollars can be attributed to the government. President Roosevelt believes that he has the right to take it over, but President Roosevelt has not yet announced his plan. Therefore, it is still uncertain whether President Roosevelt will take over the reserves of the Reserve Banks worth 3.6 billion yuan. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>New Uses for Silver</h3>
<p>Important Discoveries in the Medical Field</p>
<p>(London) Dr. Shelton of England has discovered the important functions of silver in the human body and certain plants. It is claimed that the most silver is found in the adrenal glands and the tonsils, especially in childhood. Therefore, young children lacking silver often have the habit of putting silver coins in their mouths. In plants, the growth of pennycress and nicotine, and the secretion of tobacco trichomes, also benefit from silver. According to this invention, which was announced today in the British Medical Journal, silver has the potential for new uses and can provide a basis for silver advocates to increase their arguments. British Senators Pittman and Thomas will definitely pay attention to this. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>French Giant Swindle Case Sparks Fierce Debate, Paris Returns to Calm. Chaudemps Wins Vote of Confidence. House of Representatives Passes Government Trust Vote. Decision on Swindle Case to be Thoroughly Investigated by the Courts. Interesting Drama of Former Prime Ministers' Verbal Sparring</h3>
<p>(Paris) Paris is now calm again, and the Chaudemps Cabinet has regained stability, as the House of Representatives tonight passed a vote of confidence in the government by a vote of 376 to 205. The result of the two days of fierce debate in the House of Representatives regarding the Bayonne swindle case was a personal victory for Prime Minister Chaudemps. The motion to form a parliamentary investigation committee has failed, and the judiciary can now carry out its duties without political interference. Chaudemps strongly opposed the motion to form an investigation committee proposed by the right-wing party, because the Stavisky swindle case is purely judicial in nature and has nothing to do with politics. This motion was ultimately defeated by a vote of 360 to 229.</p>
<h3>Case for Establishing an Investigative Committee Rejected Due to Delays</h3>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, the House of Representatives continued to discuss the interpellation regarding the Stavisky swindle case. Right-wing parliamentarian Ybarnégaray proposed appointing 44 members of the House of Representatives to form an investigative committee to handle the swindle case. As a result, the House of Representatives rejected it by a vote of 360 to 229, still expressing confidence in the government. The details of the discussion are recorded below: When Parliamentarian Ybarnégaray spoke, he mentioned the Hungarian bond affair. Finance Minister Bonnet replied that the Bank for International Settlements had never guaranteed Stavisky. Stavisky originally intended to sell these bonds in France, and he (Bonnet claimed) obtained the consent of Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour and forbade it. Otherwise, the amount Stavisky swindled would probably be more than it is now, at least an additional 500 million francs. Ybarnégaray then accused former Labor Minister Dalimier, saying that since he had allowed the Social Insurance Bank to subscribe to Bayonne municipal bonds, why had he not investigated Stavisky and Tissier, the director of the Bayonne Municipal Credit Bank, who were involved in this matter in advance? Isn't that a bit negligent? The detective squad leader did not notify the judicial authorities immediately after the incident and did not take the necessary steps immediately, which was also a dereliction of duty. Ybarnégaray concluded that the parliament should do something today so as not to fail the trust of the people. Former Prime Minister Herriot, leader of the Radical Socialist Party, then proposed a motion in the name of the party, saying that he believed that the government would do its duty and at the same time demanded that the judiciary strictly enforce the law and not have any scruples. The Socialist Party also proposed a motion calling for the reform of the police and judiciary and to expose the truth about the swindle case. The Communist Party's motion advocated that a committee be jointly organized by the two houses of parliament to conduct an investigation. Parliamentarian Ybarnégaray also put forward a motion in the name of the right-wing central party, requesting that 44 members of the House of Representatives organize an investigation committee. Former Prime Minister Herriot strongly advocated the motion he proposed to trust the government, saying that over the years, banks had gone bankrupt, and the people had suffered great losses, but he had never heard of any investigations. Why would such a method be used this time? "He doesn't want to hide anything, and wants to investigate thoroughly." Herriot protested against some parties' use of the swindle case to attack left-wing figures. At 5:25 PM, the meeting was adjourned for a moment. The Socialist Party decided during the break to vote in favor of the motion proposed by Herriot, expressing confidence in the government, and opposing the appointment of an investigation committee. At this time, the government's ability to obtain the support of a majority has become a foregone conclusion. The meeting continued at 5:35 PM. Socialist parliamentarian Olivoor demanded that the House of Representatives quickly pass various laws to protect savings undertakings. He also said that he was not able to agree with Ybarnégaray's motion to appoint an investigation committee. Former Prime Minister Théodore, leader of the right-wing party, stood up to defend Ybarnégaray's proposal, saying that in the past, whenever financial malfeasance occurred, the Socialist Party advocated the organization of an investigation committee. Why did it not agree this time? Moreover, which country does not have financial malfeasance cases? Isn't France the only one? Since there is this case, it should be investigated jointly by all political parties instead of always entrusting this responsibility to the government. Subsequently, Prime Minister Chaudemps declared that the government had decided to reorganize the judiciary and the judicial police affairs, but the reorganization should be done calmly and peacefully and not hastily. He should investigate Ybarnégaray's criticism of the detective squad's negligence to clarify responsibility. However, if an investigation committee is organized, the procedures will be cumbersome and will probably delay the time, so that the truth cannot be revealed, and the current government can also shirk its responsibility, because most of the facts of the swindle case occurred long before he took office. At 9:50 PM, the meeting was temporarily suspended. Finally, the House of Representatives voted on the interpellation. In the end, it voted to trust the government by a vote of 360 to 229, rejecting the motion to organize a parliamentary investigation committee, and passed the motion proposed by Herriot by a vote of 378 to 205.

<h3>French Revolutionary Conspiracy</h3>
<p>A Five-Man Directorate Discovered by the Police</p>
<p>(Paris) Someone in Paris was conspiring to implement a five-man directorate when the government was overthrown due to the Bayonne swindle case. Fortunately, it was discovered by the police and prevented from being realized. It is reported that these people intended to follow the five-man directorate method implemented during the French First Republic from 1795 to 1799, and had already appointed five people as follows: former President Doumergue, Senator Caillaux, the famous general of the Great War Weygand, Paris Police Chief Chiappe, and Radical Socialist leader Daladier. However, according to the police investigation, none of the people who were nominated knew about it. (Guomin, 13th)</p>
<h3>Herriot and Théodore Engaged in a Heated Verbal Sparring Match: One Calm, One Quite Indignant</h3>
<p>Although today's meeting in the House of Representatives was not as intense as yesterday's in the debate on the swindle case, the two former prime ministers Herriot and Théodore engaged in a heated verbal sparring match. Herriot defended the Radical Party's motive for trusting the government, mentioning the country's aid to banks in difficult situations. Théodore refuted it, saying, "Are you saying that Stéeg (former Radical Party Prime Minister) lent 100 million francs to the Alsace-Lorraine Bank?" Herriot replied calmly and with a smile, "I am referring to the fact that you should send, not lend, 200 million francs to the National Credit Bank." A parliamentarian from Théodore's party stood up and claimed that the National Credit Bank had returned 170 million francs last year, but Finance Minister Bonnet immediately replied that as of today, the bank still owed a total of 200 million francs and hoped that 150 million francs could be recovered next year. Thereupon, Théodore, amid the emotional tension, threw up his sleeves and left the parliament. The atmosphere then returned to calmness. Herriot's speech then returned to the main topic. Before long, Théodore re-entered the parliament and denounced Lafont, a parliamentarian from the New Socialist Party, as a liar, which again caused an uproar. Finally, Théodore claimed that he supported the motion to organize a thorough investigation committee, that he opposed dictatorship in the Republican principle, and that he believed that there was absolutely no question of a coup. Paris was calm as usual at night. Indeed, many young people stood in the streets in the rain, but no incidents occurred and the police did not have to intervene. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<p>◎ Vienna: Former Austrian National Socialist Party leader Frauenfeld and other leaders have now been arrested again, apparently due to pressure from Austrian Chancellor Dr. Dollfuss and the Home Guard. Although this move was not unexpected, it is particularly surprising that Count Alberti, the leader of the Lower Austria Home Guard, who is a proponent of Fascism and has contact with the National Socialist Party, has also been arrested.

<h3>German Communist Party Female Parliamentarian's Estate Confiscated</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The mansion of Mrs. Zietkin, leader of the German Communist Party, on the outskirts of Berlin was ordered to be confiscated today by the Prussian State Government. Mrs. Zietkin died in Russia in June of last year. According to the regulations on the disposal of Communist Party property, the house should be confiscated. Mrs. Zietkin's mansion is worth 60,000 marks and is a non-Prussian-style residence. She lived in this house for a long time until 1924, when she moved to Moscow. After Mrs. Zietkin's death, the residence was inherited by her son. Furthermore, after the Communist Party won the German parliamentary election in 1932, Mrs. Zietkin, as the oldest member of parliament, was elected as the chairman of the opening day of parliament. Mrs. Zietkin did not consider herself old and traveled a long distance to sit in the chairman's seat at the opening of parliament on August 30th. (Guomin, 12th)</p>
<h3>Annual Meeting of the Land Administration Society to be Held in Zhenjiang Today</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Land Administration Society is scheduled to convene its first general meeting in Zhenjiang starting from the 14th. Attendees include Wang Qiyun. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss methods for land consolidation in China. Land is where mankind resides and is the foundation for all material equipment. Human needs such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation, as well as all construction materials, originate from the land. Therefore, the formation and development of a region's systems and culture often depend on the proper use of land and the appropriate distribution of land rights. Land should be based on the principle of equality to address the drawbacks of private land ownership. More than eighty members and over twenty group members are expected to attend this conference. The Ministry of Interior, the General Staff Headquarters, the Land Survey Bureau, the Hydrographic Survey Bureau, the Civil Affairs Departments of various provinces, municipal governments, and land social bureaus are required to send representatives. The central government has designated Chen Guofu, and the Ministry of Education has designated Zhou Fo Hai to deliver instructions. The proposals to be discussed during the meeting include: (A) Issues concerning the procedures for land consolidation in China: (1) formal surveying and registration; (2) simplified consolidation; (B) The focus of land issues in China: (1) tenancy system; (2) land utilization.

<h3>Kong Xiangxi's Chauffeur Opens Fire, Injuring a Police Officer on Duty; Case Sent to Court for Prosecution</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi's eight-year-old son was riding in a private car, number 116, driven by chauffeur Sun Chuqi, on the 12th to go shopping in the south of the city. At the intersection of Baixia Road, a conflict arose with a police officer on duty for disobeying traffic directions. The chauffeur then shot and injured the officer's left finger and a chartered car driver, Dong Baohua. Upon receiving the news, the relevant department of the Ministry of Finance immediately dispatched personnel to the scene to investigate the truth and reported to Xu Jianping, the chief of general affairs in Shanghai. The chauffeur, Sun Chuqi, has now been handed over to the local court by the police department for prosecution. Furthermore, on the 13th, Kong Xiangxi telegraphed Shi Ying, the mayor of Nanjing, from Shanghai, saying: "I just read in the "Shishi Xinbao" that a chauffeur of the Ministry of Finance opened fire and injured a police officer. I do not know if it is true or what caused it. I have always been very strict in employing and disciplining people. Please investigate the truth. If it is indeed the case, the fault lies with the chauffeur, and I hope you will handle it strictly according to the law. I will not show any favoritism." (Special dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<h3>The Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee Plans to Levy Taxes to Build Embankments</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) After the closure of the Yellow River's various outlets, experts' surveys indicate that the Yellow River is at risk of changing its course. If large embankments are not built urgently, this year's flooding will be more severe than last year's, and Tianjin will inevitably be affected. However, the cost of building the embankments will be at least over one million yuan, and raising such funds will not be easy. The Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee plans to add an embankment construction tax to customs duties and is currently drafting a plan to be submitted to the provincial government for discussion in the coming days.

<h3>The Current Situation in Northeast China Under Japanese Iron Heel</h3>
<p>— Zheng Dong</p>
<p>(Correspondence from Changchun) (1)</p>
<p>Japan's invasion of Northeast China has always had a consistent plan. The sudden outbreak of the September 18th Incident was merely the realization of its continental policy. Looking back at the progress of the Japanese iron heel's advancement into Manchuria since September 18th, two years have passed. In this auspicious springtime of the third year, the Japanese warlords are loudly singing their songs of victory on our plains. Today, they are not only following their planned course, but also actively implementing their insidious annexation tactics. The current Governor-General of Korea, Ugaki Kazushige, once said, "From now on, we can use the experience of governing Korea to govern Manchuria, and with past experience, we will have even greater confidence in completing it quickly..." What should our countrymen think upon hearing this? Japan is playing puppet games, performing its two-man comedy, while implementing Japanese-Manchurian economic control, exploiting the blood and sweat of our compatriots in Northeast China, and driving our people in Northeast China to be cattle and horses, while they act as supreme emperors, reaping the benefits and doing whatever they want. All of this is probably unimaginable for our countrymen far away in the interior. Hereafter, I wish to record what I have seen and learned through inquiries and present it to our countrymen. Having endured countless dangers and interrogations to get here, and with no freedom to submit manuscripts, I must risk doing so out of conscience. I will elaborate as follows:</p>
<h3>I. Ironclad Evidence of Japanese Rule in the Puppet State</h3>
<p>Since seizing Northeast China, Japan has created the so-called "Manchukuo," establishing government offices and counties, creating a grand and imposing façade, seemingly forming a country. However, all important positions within the government are filled by Japanese. According to my investigation, from June of last year to the present, although the majority of administrative personnel in various organizations, large and small, are traitors, and each organization is headed by a traitor, the real power, such as department chiefs and section chiefs, is entirely held by Japanese. Japanese employees hold the real power, while the traitors are merely puppets living on stipends. This is ironclad evidence of Japanese manipulation of the puppet state, which no one can deny. Take the State Council as an example: among the more than 700 employees, more than 300 are Japanese, which speaks volumes. Below is a list of the names, positions, and comparisons of Japanese and puppet officials in the puppet state. Although the material may be dry, it is important data on the Japanese rule in the puppet state.</p>

<h3>Hunan Remnant Bandits Divide and Flee</h3>
<p>Chen Jicheng Plans to Encircle and Suppress the Eight-Doo Mountain Bandit Stronghold</p>
<p>Hunan Special Political Bureau Decides to Establish Daban City</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Kong Hechong's remnant bandits, around mid-December of last year, launched a large-scale intrusion into Hunan, and the bandit flames flared up for a time. Counties such as Zhang, Puchi, Chongyang, and Tongshan successively reported alarms, and Xueguanfan, Yanglinfan, and Eight-Doo Mountain in the western border of Chongyang all fell into bandit strongholds. The Joint Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui received the report and immediately ordered He Chengjun to dispatch troops to provide assistance and send aircraft for reconnaissance and bombing. He Jian also telegraphed Chen Jicheng, commander of the Third Column, to supervise Feng Xingxian, Guo Runan, and Li Jue's departments, as well as the security teams of various counties, to encircle and suppress from all sides. By the 27th, the deployment of various armies was ready and operations began. After seven days of fierce fighting with the bandits, by January 2nd of this year, the bandit crowd was largely defeated, and the serious situation suddenly eased. After being hit hard, the bandits abandoned their plan to capture Chongyang and fled in four groups: one group fled to Hongshang, Hongxia, and Dongping on the border of Chong and Pu; one group fled to Heiqiao and Bankeng on the border of Chong and Xian; one group fled to Xiaosaping, Tangkou, Dadonggang, and Xiaodonggang on the border of Chong and Tong; and one group fled to Mushigang under the jurisdiction of Yangxin County. Xueguanfan, Yanglinfan, and Eight-Doo Mountain also remained in the hands of the bandits. On the 7th, Chen Jicheng transferred troops to Huzhaoshi in the west of Chongyang County, first advancing to Xueguanfan and Yanglinfan to suppress them, and at the same time sent teams to search the Hongshang, Hongxia, and Taohualing areas to protect Chongpu's transportation. After each route gained an advantage, he would unite with the garrison troops and teams in Linxiang, Tongcheng, and Puchi to launch a large-scale attack on the Eight-Doo Mountain bandit stronghold. Chen considered that Moushi in Yangxin County, which is adjacent to Tongshan and other counties, was an important town in southern Hunan. In order to advance both military and political affairs, he specially requested Chairman Chiang to establish a special political bureau there. Chairman Chiang had approved it, ordering the Hunan Provincial Government to send personnel for inspection and determine measures. The general bureau site would be located in the center of Daban City, with one bureau chief, to be selected by the Third Column Command and requested by the Provincial Government for appointment, and reported to the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters for record. The expenses would be paid by the Provincial Government according to the first-class example. It is heard that it may be organized and established at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. (12th)</p>
<h3>Transportation on the Border of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian</h3>
<p>Highway Transportation Has Been Completed</p>
<p>Jiangxi-Zhejiang Railway Actively Under Construction</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: On the border of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian, there are the Yandang and Wuyi mountains standing between them, and transportation has always been rugged. Since the completion of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, the Jiangxi-Zhejiang motor road has also been opened to traffic, connecting to Yushan. It only takes eight hours from Nanchang to Yushan, and no more than one day from Yushan to Hangzhou. During this anti-rebellion military campaign, the Jiangxi-Zhejiang and Hangzhou-Jiangshan railways became the hub of military transportation. However, from the junction of Jiangxi and Zhejiang into Fujian, the car is still not in line, and the horses cannot go side by side. Zhao Guantao first rushed to build the Guangfeng-Pucheng highway, which is connected to the Jiangxi-Zhejiang and Hangzhou-Jiangshan roads leading to Yushan. At the same time, Chairman Chiang appointed Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, as the Director of the Jiangxi-Zhejiang-Fujian-Anhui Border Highway Office, and together with various departments, they separately built the Zhejiang-Fujian highway, from Jiangshan to Pucheng. The Jiangshan-Changshan-Guanhua-Quzhou-Lanxi to Shangrao-Yushan branch lines have also been connected. That is, from Pucheng to the counties near the border of the three provinces, it will also be accessible in all directions. According to people from Shangrao, Hekou is now the transportation center of eastern Jiangxi. From here, cars to Guangfeng and Pucheng are endless, but it is not economical to detour through Yushan. Guo, the Administrative Commissioner of Shangrao, has been ordered to build the Shangrao County to Forty-Eight Du Road on the Sanjiang Bridge section from Shangrao to Hekou, that is, to cross the lake at Hutantou into the Shang (Rao) Guang (Feng) section, and connect to Fujian to avoid detours. Also, regarding the conversion of the Jiangxi-Zhejiang motor road into a railway and connecting it to the Hangzhou-Jiangshan road, the authorities have been planning for a long time, and now it has become a reality. The funds and material purchases have been sorted out, and the Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces and the Bank of China jointly plan to organize a railway company. The main purpose is to expand the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway into the Jiangxi-Zhejiang Railway, first building the Yushan-Nanchang section. In terms of technology, the Ministry of Railways plans to use 60-pound steel rails for combined transportation with Hangzhou-Jiangshan. In terms of funds, in addition to Jiangxi issuing 12 million public bonds, the Ministry of Railways will issue another 12 million public bonds for the company to raise funds. The company organization will set up a board of directors, with two representatives from the railway and the Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces, and four from the banking sector. After all parties agree, the Ministry of Railways will submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. (January 9)</p>
<h3>Bandit Suppression and Road Construction in Southern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Remnant Bandits in Changhewei Lianhu Have Been Defeated</p>
<p>Xionggang Trunk Road Can Be Completed by the End of This Month</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Yu Hanmou, the commander of the First Guangdong Army, returned to defend southern Jiangxi, he has supervised and led his troops to clear up the remnant bandits, and has repeatedly captured them. According to Deng Qichang, the head of the Second Division's Training Regiment, reported on the 3rd, at the end of last month, more than 600 communist bandits from the pseudo-22nd Division's 64th Regiment attacked Changhewei near Anyuan. The 5th Regiment of the Second Division stationed in Chongshiwei immediately sent two battalions of soldiers to suppress them. They encountered the bandits at Anbei. The bandits stubbornly resisted based on the high mountains. After about three hours of fierce fighting, our Third Battalion launched a fierce attack on the bandit position. At about 4 pm, the bandits on the mountain were defeated. At 7 pm, the team returned to Chongshi. In this battle, more than ten bandits were killed, one platoon leader was captured alive, and dozens of bandit rifles and ten steel helmets were seized. At the beginning of this month, Yu Hanmou went to Xinfeng on patrol again. Suddenly, it was reported that more than 700 communist bandits suddenly appeared in Lianhu, north of Xinfeng, and attempted to harass various villages and towns. Yu immediately withdrew Chen Zhang's department, Liang Rongqiu's regiment, from the Second Independent Brigade to encircle them. Liang's regiment first lured the communist bandits closer, and then encircled them from three sides. After four hours of fierce fighting between the two sides, the bandits were unable to support themselves and fled to Mount Baimei. More than half of the bandits were killed or wounded. Recently, there have been no bandit traces near Lianhu.</p>
<p>Since the remnant bandits in more than ten counties in southern Jiangxi have been successively cleared, the aftermath is now being actively handled. The military authorities, on the one hand, ordered the counties to strengthen their walls and clear the fields to prevent the remnant bandits from stealing and launching attacks, and on the other hand, they are rushing to build roads to promote local interests and facilitate transportation. It is found that the first trunk line of the southern Jiangxi highway starts from Nanxiong on the Guangdong border, passes through Dayu in Jiangxi, and reaches Nankang, up to Ganzhou. The roadbed has been built, but the bridges in the Xincheng section between Dayu and Nankang have not yet been completed. The bridges and culverts in the section from Nankang to Ganzhou are also under construction. The entire road will be completed by the end of this month. If the Xionggang Road is successful, it can be connected to the Shaoxiong Road to the south. At that time, it will be possible to drive from Shaoguan in Guangdong to Ganzhou City, which is of great significance to the transportation between Jiangxi and Guangdong. In addition, the Sanan lines are also connected to various counties on the Guangdong border. The Qiannan line can be connected to Wengyuan in northern Guangdong, and the Longnan line can reach Lianping and Heping in northeastern Guangdong. The former has already been opened to traffic, and the latter is also under construction. The Sanan roads are connected to each other, opening up another line, exiting Wangmudu, and connecting to the Yu Kang trunk line. The road from Xinfeng to Nanxiong has been completed, and the section from Xinfeng to Ganzhou has also been more than half completed. To the west of Ganzhou, there is the Shangchong Highway, from Shangyou to Chongyi, and the Chongnan Highway, from Chongyi to Nankang. The road lines have completed eighty or ninety percent. The above-mentioned road projects have been built by the First Army Department using the military-industrial system, so the development has been rapid. Recently, the Southern Jiangxi Administrative Office was established, and the Southern Jiangxi Highway Office will be organized by the Transportation Construction Section of the office to manage highway transportation matters in various subordinate areas.

<h3>Hebei Province Forms Provincial Security Office</h3>
<p>Commands Police and Militia Throughout the Province</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Hebei Provincial Government believes that due to the war in eastern Hebei last year, people's livelihoods were depleted, order has not been restored, and the counties in southern Hebei were again hit by the Yellow River flood, society is unstable, and the countryside is bankrupt, resulting in frequent bandit atmosphere in various places, especially in the eastern Hebei area, where bandits have never been completely suppressed. Due to the restrictions of the war zone agreement, heavy firearms and troops cannot be sent there. The bandits know the hidden information and harass them even more. Although the counties have militia organizations, they are mostly recruited. They have no connection with the stationed security team, and they are unwilling to obey the command of a county magistrate when something happens. Therefore, although the militia is set up, it is not very effective. Yu Xuezhong, in view of this before the New Year, organized the Hebei Provincial Security Office. Its purpose is to unify the command of the militia police in the province, eliminate past malpractices, and form a whole useful organization. If a military incident occurs, the Security Office can command it at any time. The police and militia in the counties will act in unison. All service personnel in the office are transferred from the Hebei Civil Affairs Department's Security Committee, Police Department, and Provincial Government Secretariat. It is scheduled to be formally established in the middle of this month and attached to the Provincial Government. The Civil Affairs Department also notified the counties to cancel the recruitment of defense groups in the counties from this month and change it to a conscription method. Each village household will conscript six or seven people, and fewer will conscript three or four people. The conscription age is limited from 20 to 40 years old. After conscription, they will be trained for three months, and after the expiration, they will return to their villages. If something happens, they will be summoned by the counties and towns by order. The purpose is to hide soldiers in the agriculture, without spending public funds, and implement the self-defense of the people. Today (September), the Provincial Government also discussed and passed the organizational outline of the Security Office. The articles are as follows: (Article 1) The Hebei Provincial Government is to command special police teams, security teams, and promote the efficiency of defense groups in the province, and set up the Hebei Provincial Security Office. (Article 2) The Security Office will have one director, concurrently held by the chairman of the Provincial Government, and two deputy directors, concurrently held by the director. (Article 3) The Security Office will have one inspector general, concurrently held by the head of the Police Department, three section chiefs, and six to nine section members, who will be dispatched by the director from the staff of the relevant agencies. (Article 4) The Security Office is divided into three sections, and its responsibilities are as follows: (1) General Affairs Section, in charge of documents, seals, personnel, law enforcement, communication, general affairs, etc. (2) Training Section, in charge of organization, dispatch, training, and intelligence, etc. (3) Management Section, in charge of salary, ammunition, uniforms, etc. (Article 5) Each section of the Security Office may handle matters in groups depending on the situation. (Article 6) All personnel of the Security Office, from section members and above, are unpaid. Clerks and below may be paid a salary. Each section may employ employees and clerks as needed. (Article 7) The Security Office uses presentations to the Provincial Government, orders to the counties and teams, and letters to other unrelated agencies. (Article 8) The expenses of the Security Office shall be budgeted by the Provincial Government and issued by the Finance Department. (Article 9) The official seal of the Security Office shall be issued by the Provincial Government. (Article 10) The detailed rules for the operation of each section of the Security Office shall be formulated separately. (Article 11) This outline shall be implemented from the date of promulgation by the Provincial Government. (9th)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Construction Director Talks About the Actual Situation of Conscripting Labor to Repair and Dredge the Liutang River</h3>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Provincial Government actively prepared for the project of conscripting labor to repair and dredge the Liutang River, the counties along the river have recently started work one after another. The Current Affairs News Weekly Review on the 7th of this month raised four questions about this move. The reporter specially visited Director Shen of the Construction Department to inquire about his opinions. Director Shen explained them one by one as follows: "I have also seen the comments in the newspaper. I think it is because I have not been able to understand the actual situation, which led to these speculations. The first point, regarding the issue of wages, is not that the wage is 7.5 cents per person per day, but it is still priced by the square. The unit price is determined according to the experience of conscripting labor in various places and the current actual situation. The provincial government convened the county magistrates to come to the province to discuss and set the minimum price for building dikes at 4 cents per cubic meter, the highest at 6 cents, and the average at 5 cents. The minimum price for digging rivers is 7 cents per cubic meter, the maximum is 10 cents, and the average is 8.5 cents. On average, each person can build 3 to 4 cubic meters of dikes or dig about 2 cubic meters of rivers per day, then each person can earn more than 15 cents per day, which can maintain their livelihood. The stipulation of this square price takes into account the financial difficulties of the provincial government, striving to handle it by conscripting labor, and at the same time taking into account the difficulty of the workers' lives, and still pricing by the square. Therefore, after several consultations, it is considered very appropriate. The second point, regarding the issue of corruption, the provincial government has also paid attention to this for a long time. When the county magistrates' meeting was convened in October last year, Chairman Chen gave a thorough explanation and specially urged that if there is any fraud such as bullying the villagers and deducting from it to seek profit, the county magistrates should be severely punished at any time, and the county magistrates who are also the section chiefs of each section should also set an example and be a model for all staff members. Afterwards, we should still send personnel to conduct secret investigations at any time. The third point, regarding the issue of the quality of the workers, although there are tens of thousands of workers conscripted this time, they are all divided according to the number of acres, and most of them are peaceful farmers along the river, all of whom have permanent property. They have also been compiled into rows and teams, and the township and district chiefs are also the captains and team leaders to lead the work. It can be avoided to cause trouble by borrowing. Moreover, since this project has a direct stake, the local people are extremely clear. Even if bad elements mix in, not only should the government strictly eliminate them, but also the good workers will not tolerate them. The fourth point, regarding the issue of how to settle the workers after the completion of the work, the workers conscripted are farmers along the river, and they work using the agricultural gap period. After the work is completed, they return to farming, and there is no need to find another way. It is estimated that when the Liutang River project is completed, it will be the time when farming is about to begin, and the farmers can continue to engage in agriculture."</p>

<h3>Association to Promote National Goods Requests Tax Increase on Japanese Light Bulbs</h3>
<p>Hu Xiyuan Visited Tang Haian to Request Meeting</p>
<p>According to an investigation by the Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Goods, Japanese merchants are practicing dumping due to overproduction. Various goods are being shipped to China in large quantities, which is severely affecting the entire national goods industry, especially the electrical appliance industry. The Shanghai Electrical Appliance Manufacturers Association and member factories of the light bulb industry have sent letters requesting relief to survive. The third joint meeting of the 14th Executive and Supervisory Committees decided to submit requests to both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to seek remedies. The original submission is recorded below:</p>
<p>Submitting that Japanese goods, electric light bulbs, are imported as raw materials to reduce taxes. We sincerely request that you instruct customs in various places to levy taxes on all goods as finished products to prevent taking advantage of loopholes and to protect national goods. The various members of the Shanghai Electrical Appliance Manufacturers Association and the member factories that manufacture electric light bulbs have sent letters stating that Japanese merchants have recently imported light bulbs without copper heads as raw materials to reduce taxes, resulting in lower costs and undercutting prices. This is implementing a dumping policy, which has greatly harmed the national light bulb factories. Goods are stagnant and sales are sluggish, leading to a standstill. All workers are facing the panic of unemployment. This matter concerns the future of the national goods industry and is of great importance. Please provide relief to maintain our survival, etc.</p>
<p>We have investigated that Japanese merchants are cunning by nature and practice dumping, which harms all national goods, especially the electrical appliance industry. They import light bulbs without copper heads as raw materials, deceiving customs to steal and reduce import tax rates, lowering costs, disrupting the market, and squeezing out national goods. Their intentions are vicious. If we do not find a countermeasure soon, the national light bulb factories will suffer serious damage and all will be shut down, creating social unrest. The association has an unshirkable responsibility to protect national goods. It is appropriate to submit a request to your ministry, requesting the Ministry of Finance) to instruct customs in various places to levy taxes on all light bulbs as finished products imported in the aforementioned manner to prevent taking advantage of loopholes and to protect national goods. We anxiously await your instructions.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency said that Japanese headless light bulbs are imported and taxed as raw materials. Cunning merchants are also cleverly creating various brands to disrupt the market for genuine national light bulbs. This matter has already aroused serious attention in society. The Municipal Electrical Appliance Manufacturers Association has already telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry. The chairman of the association, Hu Xiyuan, met with Minister Chen Gongbo in Shanghai the other day and requested that the headless light bulbs be taxed as finished light bulbs as soon as possible. Minister Chen agreed on the spot, saying that he would rush back to the ministry to handle it and that it would be recorded. Yesterday, at the request of the other businesses, Mr. Hu revisited Tang Haian, the superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, to discuss increasing the import tax rate on headless light bulbs. It is reported that the superintendent of customs has already requested the Tax Affairs Department to pay close attention.</p>
<h3>National Goods Production and Sales Contract to Hold Inaugural Meeting Tomorrow</h3>

Yesterday morning, the reporter from the Japanese Daily News specifically visited Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi. Counselor Ariyoshi responded to questions, and the conversation is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Have Not Landed</h3>
<p>Mr. Ariyoshi first stated that the Japanese military authorities, in order to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents given the imminent outbreak of war in Fuzhou, did send warships carrying marines to Fujian to prepare for any eventuality, but the report that they had already landed in Fuzhou for guard duty is not true. We have not received a telegram about it either. However, when the time is right, that is, when the war breaks out, the Ministry of the Navy will order the marines to land south of the Nantai Bridge in Fuzhou to protect Japanese residents.</p>
<h3>Two Ships Enter Min River</h3>
<p>Currently, there are two Japanese warships in Fuzhou: the Hamakaze destroyer, originally stationed in Magong Port, and the Tatekaze warship. The Tatekaze warship was originally stationed in Xiamen, but now that Xiamen has been recaptured by the Chinese Navy and the area is safe, it has been ordered to come from Xiamen. Both ships have arrived in Fuzhou and entered the Min River. The number of marines carried on the ships is approximately two battalions. Because the areas where Japanese residents live are adjacent to the Min River, they can land for guard duty in a few minutes in case of emergency.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents All Withdraw</h3>
<p>As for the report that Ambassador Ariyoshi refused to allow Japanese residents to move, this is no longer an issue. According to a telegram from Fuzhou Consul Moriya, the approximately 10,000 Japanese residents in Fuzhou have now all withdrawn outside the city to designated safe areas, that is, the Qiancangshan area south of the bridge. Because there are few houses and many people, some are temporarily living near the Japanese Consulate, the Peiyuan Elementary School, and the South China Women's University. The lives of the residents should be safe, but there are still a small number of Taiwanese and their property in the city that are difficult to move. We are still asking the Chinese authorities to find ways to protect them. The reporter also asked whether it was reported that the central government had sent Foreign Minister Tang Yuren to Shanghai to negotiate the withdrawal of Japanese residents with the Japanese ambassador. It is said that they have not heard of this. As for Xiamen, it is now peaceful as usual, and Japanese residents who cannot retreat are also not a problem.</p>
<h3>Consular Corps Urges Fujian to Withdraw Troops</h3>
<p>Mr. Ariyoshi said at the end that war clouds are spreading over Fuzhou. In recent days, consuls from China, Britain, and the United States have been meeting at the Japanese Consulate on Qiancangshan with Japanese Consul Moriya to discuss ways to protect foreign residents. There are not many British and American residents in Fujian, and they have already moved to Cangshan, but there are still churches, hospitals, and schools that cannot avoid being affected by artillery fire. Therefore, the consular corps has proposed to persuade the 19th Route Army to withdraw its troops from Fuzhou to avoid sacrificing the people, but for the sake of caution, it is still being considered.</p>
<h3>Four Ministries Order New Regulations on Anti-Piracy Escorts for Sea Vessels</h3>
<p>Naval Police and Customs Vessels Jointly Responsible for Anti-Piracy</p>
<p>Shanghai sea vessels suffered pirate attacks repeatedly last year. After various shipping companies petitioned the central government to suppress them, the Ministry of Transportation invited the Ministries of Interior, Navy, and Finance, along with representatives from the Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Shipping Association, to discuss anti-piracy plans. After many meetings, practical measures for suppressing piracy and providing escorts have been formulated, and they will be implemented jointly with the various shipping companies in Shanghai. Recently, there have been several more cases of pirate attacks on merchant ships due to unrest in the sea. Therefore, the anti-piracy escort law will be implemented ahead of schedule. Yesterday, various shipping companies received the anti-piracy implementation law ordered by the four ministries. The reporter has investigated and recorded it as follows:</p>
<h3>Four Ministries Formulate Measures</h3>
<p>The Ministries of Transportation, Navy, Finance, and Interior, and Shanghai shipping representatives such as Shen Jiyun, discussed preventing pirate attacks on ships after the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yushun ship encountered a pirate attack last year. At that time, representatives of the various ministries believed that anti-piracy on sea vessels required the simultaneous assistance of the various ministries in order to achieve mutual benefit. In addition to dispatching naval vessels to provide escorts, shipping companies also need to improve construction. The four ministries have held many meetings on this case, and it has now been revised. The Ministry of Transportation has issued Instruction No. 74 to Shanghai, ordering the various shipping companies in this port to strictly comply.</p>
<h3>Coastal Military Police Cooperate in Defense</h3>
<p>The four ministries decided on 16 measures for suppressing piracy and providing escorts. Article 1: These regulations apply to the escort of passenger and cargo ships sailing from Chinese ports in coastal or ocean voyages. Article 2: The Navy Department, the Coastal Defense Command, and the Fleet are responsible for suppressing piracy and providing escorts on the water. The Ministry of Interior directs the land and water police officers under the jurisdiction of the coastal provinces' police agencies to be responsible for handling land routes and nearby islands and report them at any time. Article 3: The Coastal Defense Command will dispatch ships to be stationed and patrol the sea areas where pirates appear and where ships have been attacked.</p>
<h3>Salt Customs Responsible for Smuggling Suppression</h3>
<p>If customs and salt customs vessels hear of pirate alarms or know of pirate traces, they must immediately report to naval warships or the Coastal Defense Fleet. If there is a temporary request, they should provide assistance. Article 4: Naval warships and marines should do their best to assist if the anti-piracy forces of the Coastal Defense Command or the land and water police are insufficient. Article 5: The naval vessels should be responsible for rescuing when they receive distress signals from ships via wireless. Nearby customs and salt customs vessels should also go to rescue within the possible range and notify merchant ships on the same route to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Sea Vessels Equipped with Self-Defense Weapons</h3>
<p>Article 6: The water police are responsible for protecting ships that run aground or run aground. Ships with suspicious circumstances should be prohibited from approaching. Article 7: Seagoing merchant ships should be equipped with self-defense guns and cannons in accordance with the regulations of the National Government's inspection of self-defense weapons. Article 8: The captain supervises the crew to train in the use of guns and cannons at any time. Article 9: Before the ship departs, suspicious passengers may be inspected by the local military police.</p>
<h3>Wireless Radio Should Be Isolated</h3>
<p>Article 10: Passengers' luggage and heavy objects should be stored in the hold. Article 11: Each ship should be equipped with wireless radio. Article 12: Each sea vessel should report to the designated radio station every four hours. If a distress signal is received, all agencies should be notified. Article 13: The wireless radio should be located at the highest point on the ship and completely isolated from the passenger cabin. The construction of the four walls, doors, windows, and upper cover must be able to withstand bullets. A telephone should be installed in the room to connect to the bridge and the pilot's platform.</p>
<h3>Bridge and Other Modifications</h3>
<p>Article 14: The four walls of each ship's bridge must be able to withstand bullets. In addition to the front glass windows and doors, steel windows and doors that open and close automatically should be installed. The steam steering gear should be installed inside the engine room. If the steering gears have been installed on the deck, they should be protected with steel plates. Article 15: On seagoing ships, all doors and windows connecting the engine room, boiler, and bridge with the passenger cabin must be locked at all times. They may not be opened without the permission of the supervising crew. The coal bunker openings on the deck should also be closed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Shipping Companies Have Implemented</h3>
<p>Article 16: These regulations will be implemented three months after the Executive Yuan announces them. The new anti-piracy regulations are of great importance to the navigation safety of all ships. In addition to the four ministries ordering the land and water military police to comply, the various shipping companies and sea vessels in Shanghai have complied with the established methods, improved the anti-piracy settings of the various ships, and applied for self-defense guns and cannons to train the crew to use them.</p>
<h3>Fourth Shipment of American Wheat Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chinese Flour Mills Purchase and Are Specially Granted Tax Exemption</p>
<p>Docked at Buoy and Began Unloading in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The fourth batch of American wheat purchased by our government from the United States with loans arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It was purchased by Chinese flour mills, and the Ministry of Finance specially granted tax exemption. Docked at the buoy, it began unloading in the afternoon. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Four Batches Imported</h3>
<p>The matter of transporting American loan cotton and wheat is handled by the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. He Molin, who was sent to the United States to charter ships to load, has returned to Shanghai. A total of three batches of American wheat have arrived in Shanghai, totaling five ships. As for the fourth batch, it was divided into two ships, totaling 16,782 tons. Among them, 7,832 tons were loaded on the Iron Ladenton liner, which entered the Wusongkou at 10:25 yesterday morning. The wheat loaded has all been purchased by Chinese flour mills, so it is docked at the Huangpu River buoy for the factories to pick up.</p>
<h3>Unloading in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent workers to the buoy to arrange in advance. Starting at 2:00 PM, the various flour mills that purchased the wheat successively sent ships to dock with the liner to pick up the wheat. It is expected to be unloaded within a week. As for the fourth batch of 8,950 tons loaded on the Harley Denton liner, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai within days and will also be docked at the buoy. These American wheat shipments were properly negotiated by the Central Bank's American Loan Cotton and Wheat Office and the Ministry of Finance, and special tax exemption was granted. The unloaded liners will be loaded with our country's export goods by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and returned to the United States.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Telephones Silk Industry Conference</h3>
<p>In order to relieve the silk and cocoon industry, the Ministry of Industry telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau yesterday to inform silk and cocoon industry leaders Wang Xiaolai and Chu Huiseng to go to Beijing tonight to discuss the matter. After receiving the notice, Wang and others, due to the urgency of the time, were unable to depart and have telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to request a postponement until next week.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Municipal Conference</h3>
<p>250th Session</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government held its 250th municipal conference on December 19 of last year.

<h3>Chairman Han of Shandong Province Will Invite Industry Leaders from Shanghai to Solicit Opinions, Seeking Industrial Development</h3>
<p>Mining Merchants to Jointly Establish a Large Company, Director Zhang Honglie Will Come to Shanghai to Discuss Construction</p>
<p>Mr. Qian Chengxu responded to Chairman Han of the Shandong Provincial Government's invitation last year to discuss various issues related to the development of the province's industry in a private manner. The plans presented by Mr. Qian, except for the coal production control aspect, have been adopted by the Shandong Provincial Government and the Qingdao Municipal Government, and they have begun to work together. There are also issues such as the construction of cotton and wheat warehouses and the improvement of cotton seeds, which the provincial government also considers extremely important and is planning. Soon there will be a method announced. After Mr. Qian returned to Shanghai a few days ago, the reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency went to meet him and discussed the following:</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Control</h3>
<p>"During this trip (Qian himself said), as far as I can see, Shandong's politics are on track and moving towards the construction stage. There are two things I have requested. The first is the control of coal. I advocate adopting a policy of separating production and jointly selling. Merchants should form their own companies to increase coal prices and quality, while limiting production to eliminate competition and unify the national coal front. Regarding this point, because coal exports and the coal market have a tendency to affect the interests of all parties, the steps taken by the provincial and municipal governments are extremely cautious, and the discussion time is also the longest. Finally, the opinions of the two governments have become consistent. Representatives from all parties have joined Qingji coal merchants to the Boshan and Zichuan areas along the Jiaoji Railway to convene local mine owners to further discuss the organization, and there is a possibility of establishing a company. Because the government is urging them very strictly, Zhang Honglie, director of the Shandong Construction Department, has also stated to the business community that if there is no solution, the government will never stand by. Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie has even set a time limit. The business community must establish a company preparatory office before the old lunar year ends."</p>
<h3>Cotton and Wheat Warehouses</h3>
<p>"Secondly, it is to construct cotton and wheat warehouses. I advocate adopting the Canadian wheat bank trust organization, concentrating all agricultural products in the province, building large-scale warehouses in appropriate areas, and issuing circulating warehouse receipts to raise prices and adjust finances. The result is that all inactive items can be converted into cash and circulated in rural areas. Farmers can rely on the guarantee of the items to obtain economic activity. It is estimated that the amount of various agricultural products in Shandong Province that can be used as collateral for issuing warehouse receipts is at least 100 million yuan in face value. To use this to relieve the rural areas is equivalent to increasing 100 million yuan in circulating capital. This matter is related to the revitalization of the rural areas, and the issue is extremely important. The provincial government is still considering it carefully. I am also collecting various materials on this type of organization these days, hoping to draft a concrete plan in a short period of time to facilitate promotion."</p>
<h3>Abundant Products</h3>
<p>"I didn't spend much time in Qingdao and Jinan, so I didn't have time to consult on other issues, but according to my observations, Shandong is rich in products and has a superior location, which is suitable for outside investment. First, land and water transportation is convenient, and transportation is not difficult. Second, although the location is in the center of the north and south, it is not a military zone. Third, all products, such as coal, cotton, wheat, tobacco leaves, and peanuts, are necessary items for industrial manufacturing in terms of power and raw materials. Promoting and developing them can meet the needs of the entire country for decades. Other places, such as Weixian, have inexhaustible raw materials, especially suitable for cotton spinning and cigarette manufacturing. Fourth, Shandong has the most important commercial ports and financial institutions, and it does not feel poor in financial scheduling for establishing industries. This is only in terms of economy. As for politics, under the governance of Chairman Han Fuqu in the past two years, Shandong has used millions of yuan for construction projects every year, and there are surpluses in the treasury and savings among the people. The so-called rural bankruptcy may exist elsewhere, but in Shandong, there is no sign of bankruptcy."</p>
<h3>Striving for Construction</h3>
<p>"The Provincial Department of Construction is the central hub for promoting various construction projects. Director Zhang Honglie is a student who studied in the United States and is excited about various organizations. Before I left, I told him that the world's economic situation is changing rapidly. In this complex society, doing things cannot be done by one person or one country alone. Therefore, this spring, I will come to Shanghai on a regular basis to specifically interview industry leaders and discuss the basic plans for Shandong's various construction projects in the future. Chairman Han's aspiration to revitalize Shandong's industry is also extremely eager. Soon, he will send invitations to industry leaders in Shanghai to go to Shandong to take a special trip. In addition to visiting the mountains and rivers everywhere, he also intends to solicit everyone's opinions for reference."</p>
<h3>Representatives of Various Legal Groups Go to the French Consulate to Demand Responsibility for the Return of Jin Xi</h3>
<p>Petitioning the Municipal Government to Continue Serious Negotiations</p>
<p>After Jin Xi was illegally arrested by the Japanese consulate, the city's Chamber of Commerce, Education Association, Lawyers Association, University Students Federation, Farmers Association, Taxpayer Chinese Association, Special District Citizens Federation, and other organizations initiated the Jin Case Support Association. Representatives were publicly elected to go to the municipal government yesterday to request a serious protest to the French and Japanese consulates. Then, they went to the French consulate together. At the time, it was lunchtime, and they were unable to meet with Consul General Mei. They left a simple written statement, stating that Jin Xi was illegally arrested by your consulate in coordination with Japanese police. Now, based on the two points of naturalization as a Chinese national and the judicial agreement of the concession, the French consulate should be responsible for his return. Also, before the negotiation of this case is resolved, the French consulate should seriously stop the transfer to Japan. This is of utmost importance. The original text of the joint submission of the various legal groups to the municipal government is recorded below. It is a submission regarding the illegal arrest of Jin Xi, requesting a serious protest to the French and Japanese consulates. It is submitted that Jin Xi, a national of the Republic of China, was illegally arrested by the French Central Patrol Room in coordination with the Japanese consulate on November 22, 1933. After repeated negotiations, he has not been released. Jin Xi is a national of the Republic of China. According to the exercise of the highest sovereignty of the country, no interference from any country is allowed. This time, the Japanese consulate arbitrarily arrested him, and the French consulate, without asking about the facts, hastily assisted, which is obviously an infringement of our country's sovereignty. Moreover, after the arrest, he was not transferred to the Chinese court for interrogation, but was directly handed over, which violated the concession agreement and endangered the safety of residents. If serious negotiations are not continued, not only will the country's prestige be swept away, but it will also create a bad precedent for future negotiations on naturalization. The submitters are all residents of Shanghai and are particularly concerned about the interests and harms of this issue. The public is indignant and difficult to remain silent. In addition to preparing to organize the Jin Case Support Association to thoroughly protest, we dare to ask the government to verify and quickly make a serious protest to the French and Japanese consulates to maintain sovereignty, which is in the public interest. Sincerely submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Six Point Plan for Subscribing to American Wheat and Flour</h3>
<p>Submitted to the Ministry of Finance for Approval Yesterday</p>
<p>Resolution Expected Upon Approval of Tax Exemption</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance announced the new tariff rates on imported rice and wheat, the flour manufacturers of this city have repeatedly joined forces with manufacturers from various regions, sending representatives to petition the government authorities, requesting exemption from taxes on imported wheat and flour purchased before the announcement. Although the authorities have not yet readily agreed, the manufacturers believe that the amount of wheat and flour purchased this time is substantial. If they do not persistently request a reduction in tariffs, their losses will be unbearable. Therefore, they have repeatedly negotiated with the Ministry of Finance, and progress is gradually being made. A New News Agency reporter learned from relevant sources yesterday morning that the Ministry of Finance has proposed a compromise to the manufacturers, namely, that the manufacturers must subscribe to 240,000 tons of American wheat and 6.4 million bags of American flour (worth approximately US$4 million). The manufacturers have already agreed and submitted a plan for taking delivery to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance yesterday morning, requesting approval. The plan mainly consists of the following points: (1) 240,000 tons of American wheat will arrive in China in five months, and the price will be settled in three installments, based on Chinese and foreign market conditions; (2) The composition of the American wheat will be 30% hard winter wheat and 70% No. 2 American white wheat; (3) 6.4 million bags of American flour will arrive in China in twelve months; (4) Except for the "Ren Ma," "Fu Shou," "Golden Money," and "Red Sun Dang Tian" brands, the quality of other brands of flour must be the same as the above four brands; (5) Import duties will be calculated based on a 5% reduction; (6) The government is requested to implement a refund of wheat tax for goods transported overseas and to the three northeastern provinces. If the above plan is approved by the Ministry of Finance, the manufacturers will be able to purchase the goods, and the request for tax exemption can also be resolved accordingly.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Standardizes Calculation Method for Joint Transportation Freight Rates</h3>
<p>Calculating Surcharges and Liability Fees</p>
<p>Should be Based on a Percentage of the Freight Rate</p>
<p>Regarding the standardization of the calculation method for joint transportation freight rates, the Ministry of Railways issued a special instruction to the two Railway Administrations yesterday, stating: "The joint transportation of state-owned goods was resumed in November of last year. All methods for calculating freight rates must have unified regulations to benefit merchants and ensure fairness. Since the implementation of liability-based joint transportation by the Tianjin-Pukou, Shanghai-Nanjing, and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways in September of the 21st year, all liability, priority, and highest priority fees and surcharges have been calculated as a percentage of the unit freight rate for ordinary goods, in accordance with Article 40 of the General Rules for Liability Transportation. The total amount is then multiplied by the weight to arrive at the total freight. Therefore, the original price lists for liability-based joint transportation of goods on the three railways listed ordinary freight rates, surcharges, and liability fees separately, calculated on a unit basis. When domestic joint transportation was resumed in November of last year, the Ministry, due to time constraints,</p>
<h3>Compilation of Freight Rates</h3>
<p>was unable to compile the rates in time and instructed each railway to exchange freight rate tables for use, while also filling out and submitting forms to the Ministry in accordance with the format of the joint transportation price list promulgated by the Ministry, in order to compile them. The Ministry also issued Instruction No. 7323, announcing the method for calculating joint transportation freight rates for compliance. Currently, most of the freight rate tables filled out by each railway have been received, and the Ministry is rushing to compile a compilation of joint transportation freight rate tables for each railway. However, previously, the Tianjin-Pukou, Shanghai-Nanjing, and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways calculated surcharges and liability fees as a percentage of the price, while the temporary measures stipulated in Instruction No. 7323 calculate them as a percentage of the freight rate. Furthermore, some freight bills from each railway calculate them as a percentage of the price, while others calculate them as a percentage of the freight rate. Since the methods are not uniform, freight rates vary, which is not fair. After careful research, it has been determined that it is more convenient in terms of procedure and fairer in theory to calculate all surcharges and liability fees as a percentage of the freight rate. Hereafter,</p>
<h3>Each Railway's Calculation</h3>
<p>of surcharges and liability fees should be based on a percentage of the freight rate. That is, when calculating the freight for joint transportation of goods, the freight rate per 50 kilograms or per metric ton listed in the compilation should be multiplied by the weight of each batch of goods to be transported to obtain the total freight for each batch of goods. This total amount will be used as the standard for calculating surcharges and liability fees. The above method for calculating freight rates is not only simpler for the clerks of each railway to calculate, but the compilation of joint transportation freight rates can also only list the freight rate, without the need to calculate and list other surcharges and liability fees separately. The length will be reduced compared to before, the printing costs will be reduced compared to before, and it will be more convenient to use. Therefore, the compilation of joint transportation freight rate tables compiled by the Ministry this time will only list the freight rate and not other surcharges and liability fees. Once the compilation and printing are completed, it will be distributed for use immediately. The freight</p>
<h3>Rounding of Mills</h3>
<p>method will still be handled in accordance with the provisions of Item 1 of the method for calculating joint transportation freight rates resolved at the 16th Joint Transportation Conference. That is, the ordinary freight should be calculated to the nearest fen (cent), and the li (mill) should be rounded using the four-舍-五入 (round half up) method to determine the entry or exit (e.g., 4 li and 9 hao (tenth of a mill) are discarded, while 5 li are advanced to 1 fen). However, the amount of liability, priority, highest priority, and additional fees calculated based on the freight rate is extremely small, with only mills and less than one fen, and should all be collected as one fen. Regarding this point, Tianjin-Pukou and Shanghai-Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo are inconsistent. Tianjin-Pukou adopts the rounding method, while Shanghai-Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo adopts the four-舍-五入 method, which is different and unreasonable. Hereafter, when there is an extremely small amount of less than one fen, it should all be calculated as one fen. The total amount of joint transportation freight, if there are odd amounts of less than five fen, should be calculated as five fen, and if there are odd amounts of less than one jiao (dime), it should be calculated as one jiao. However, if there are odd amounts in the amount obtained by each railway, it should still be calculated as the odd amount. If there is an excess count, it should all belong to the railway of origin. Furthermore, liability-based joint transportation,</p>
<h3>Decreasing Calculation</h3>
<p>method has been stipulated by ministerial order and examples have been published on record. However, for the sake of convenient calculation and in line with the spirit of the above calculation methods, all surcharges and liability fees should be calculated as a percentage of the freight rate after progressive distance reduction. That is, the freight rate after progressive distance reduction should be used as the standard, and surcharges and liability fees should be added separately. The above calculation methods are listed and exemplified in the order, and copies are sent along with the order. It is hereby ordered to forward them to the relevant departments and joint transportation stations for compliance and standardization. This order has been issued to the Traffic and Accounting Departments for compliance."</p>
<h3>Economic Commission Not Holding Meeting in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports from Nanjing: "The National Economic Commission, with the Fourth Plenary Session approaching, must report on all matters to be carried out by the Commission and details of implementation. Therefore, it will convene a preparatory meeting in Shanghai starting yesterday (the 13th)." However, the Shanghai Office of the Economic Commission denied this statement yesterday, saying that not only was there no meeting yesterday, but there were also no scheduled meetings in the near future.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Request to Rectify Forcing Stores to Issue Invoices and Affix Stamps</h3>
<p>Painstakingly Argues the Illegality of the Tax Bureau's Distorted Interpretation</p>
<p>Clarifies that Regulations Have No Power to Interfere</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "On the 12th of this month, according to a letter from the Beijing General Chamber of Commerce, the Hebei Provincial Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau and the Beijing Branch Bureau have repeatedly sent letters requesting notification to all stores that those selling goods worth one yuan or more must issue a sales invoice and affix a stamp accordingly. This Chamber believes that stamps are used as proof on deeds to protect rights and interests. If the parties voluntarily waive their right to have their rights guaranteed by proof, they cannot be forced to issue invoices, and since they cannot be forced to issue invoices, they cannot be forced to affix stamps. Now, the Bureau, in order to promote sales, does not hesitate to violate legal principles and forces all businesses to issue sales invoices when selling goods, which is unreasonable. May we ask if the purchaser is in a hurry to board a ship, or has a need to not wait long, or does not need the proof (for self-purchase and self-use), they must wait quietly for the invoice to be issued. This kind of behavior is truly obstructive. On December 30th of the 22nd year, this Chamber held an Executive Committee meeting, and at the same time, chairmen and representatives of various trade associations attended and stated their opinions, and resolved to send a letter to your Association to jointly submit a request to the Ministry of Finance for interpretation, so that it can be followed. We specially request that you examine and handle this matter and reply to us to show your public spirit." The utility of an invoice is that the purchaser is entrusted by others to make purchases on their behalf for credibility, or that the purchaser does not come to the store in person and the store orders someone to send it to them, so an invoice is issued for verification. If the person goes to the store to buy it themselves, the payment is made immediately, and the purchaser does not need the invoice for proof, and the store does not need to issue it. For example, if friends borrow money from each other, or because of mutual trust, they do not write a loan agreement, and the state legislature cannot force them to write an agreement or affix a stamp. The provisions of the Stamp Tax Regulations can only restrict what kind of proof must be affixed with a stamp, but cannot restrict the people from using written proof and not oral contracts. The regulations do not have this power to interfere, and the tax bureau cannot make extra-legal interpretations. It is reasonable to telegraph your Ministry for review and approval, and we humbly request that you make corrections for the public convenience. Respectfully, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<h3>Various Groups Preparing to Commemorate Mr. Yao Zirang</h3>
<p>Meeting to Discuss Commemoration Methods on the 16th</p>
<p>Cemetery Site Selected, Burial to Take Place This Month</p>
<p>Mr. Yao Zirang, a venerable elder and great Confucian scholar, devoted himself to national and local affairs for the longest time, and his achievements are well-known and admired by all. Therefore, various groups have decided to hold a memorial service to commemorate him. The preparatory office is temporarily located inside the Zhonghua Vocational School in Lujiabang, Nanshi, and 12 groups, including the Shanghai Charity Group, the Defense Group, the China Vocational Education Society, the Women's Education Institute, and the County Education Bureau, have begun preparations. The preparatory meeting will be held at 4:00 PM on Tuesday (the 16th) to discuss commemoration methods. Groups or individuals who wish to participate can notify the office by letter or attend the preparatory meeting to discuss the proceedings together. As for the location of Mr. Yao's cemetery, it has been selected in the Yuanziwei area of Caojing District in this city. Once the arrangements are completed, the funeral and burial can be held within this month. Therefore, the memorial service may have to be postponed until after the burial.</p>
<h3>Two Telegraphs Issued by the Two Railway Party Departments Yesterday</h3>
<p>Telegraphs to Comfort Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Punitive Expeditionary Soldiers</p>
<p>Urge Current Central Committee Members to Attend the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<p>East China News Agency reports that the Special Party Department of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, in recognition of the efforts of the punitive expeditionary soldiers at the front in capturing various cities, telegraphed yesterday to express their comfort. At the same time, the Party Department also believed that with the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session imminent and many Central Committee members in the Southwest still holding a wait-and-see attitude, they telegraphed each Central Committee member urging them to quickly enter Beijing to attend. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<h3>Telegraph to Punitive Expeditionary Soldiers</h3>
<p>"To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang, and forwarded to all Commanders-in-Chief, Commanders, and all soldiers of the punitive expedition against the Min rebels: Chen Li and other rebels betrayed the Party and the country, colluded with the red bandits abandoned by the whole country, and kidnapped the 19th Route Army, which was defending the country against Japan, to occupy the Min province and sell out the nation. All those with blood in their veins are heartbroken. Fortunately, Your Excellency made a decisive decision, and the generals fought bravely, entering death and being born, and various places in northern Fujian were recovered by chance. The rebels have lost their defenses, and Fuzhou can be taken down sooner or later, and a clean sweep can be expected. Seeing the ugliness without remainder, the people are safe and sound. We admire your special merits and send this telegram to express our comfort and await good news. Respectfully, the Special Party Department of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Ningbo Railways of the Chinese Kuomintang."</p>
<h3>Telegraph to Current Central Committee Members</h3>
<p>"Forwarded by various newspapers to all members of the current Central Committee: Foreign insults are rampant, and our territory is shrinking daily. Since the Min rebellion, the national crisis has become increasingly urgent. At this time of national peril, there is no way to save the country without national unity, and there is no way to resist foreign insults without consolidating the central government's power. The central government is the place where the power of the Party and the country is vested, and the Central Committee members are selected from the best talents in the country. If we want to plan the great cause of saving the country, we should consolidate the central government, and if we want to consolidate the central government, we must rely on the unity of all Central Committee members. You are responsible for the heavy task entrusted to you by all comrades of the Party. In this autumn of national crisis, it is your duty to love the country and save the people. This Association is aware of the imminent destruction of the country, and dares to represent all employees of the two railways in unanimously telegraphing to you, requesting that you come to Beijing as soon as possible to attend the Fourth Plenary Session, to jointly plan the national policy and save the crisis. We are extremely urgent. Respectfully, the Special Party Department of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways of the Chinese Kuomintang."</p>
<h3>News on the Municipal Finance Bureau Raising Regular Expenses</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau spares no effort in reorganizing existing tax sources. The income side is already surplus compared to the budget. Only because municipal undertakings are heavily funded, the municipal treasury still feels inadequate for allocation. Therefore, the regular expenses of various agencies have not been fully paid monthly. Regarding the education expenses, in addition to the November expenses that have already been allocated, the December education expenses have also been fully paid. The December expenses of other agencies are also being planned in order to supplement them clearly within days.</p>
<h3>Workers from the Two Railway Factories Petitioned the Labor Union Yesterday</h3>
<p>Requesting the Railway Bureau to Issue Double Pay and Free Tickets</p>
<p>More than 1,200 workers from various agencies and factories of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways elected 13 representatives from the Zhabei Factory, including Hong Desheng, Wang Fanglin, Qian Linhai, Shen Xiqing, and Meng Chuanbao, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon to petition the labor union, requesting the labor union to lead them to the two Railway Administrations to petition the following three matters: (1) issue double pay at the end of the year, (2) upgrade and increase salaries, (3) issue free tickets anywhere, etc. The standing director Chen Bohua replied that because yesterday was Saturday, the two Railway Administrations were not in office in the afternoon, so they could not go to the bureau to petition, and it would have to be rescheduled to petition the two Railway Administrations tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Sun Ke's Eulogy</h3>
<p>The text of the eulogy by Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, reads: "In November of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhou Xiangling of Huzhou passed away from illness in his hometown. The gentleman was well-versed in classical books and gained fame early in life. He held a heart of universal love and possessed the virtue of loyalty. He exhausted his efforts in local affairs for decades as if it was just one day. He weighed matters and deliberated on reason, and the people of both Zhejiang provinces were all benefited by his grace. Tracing his deeds, such as managing salt affairs, establishing factories, establishing schools, supplementing and transcribing the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library of the Four Treasuries) of the Zhejiang Wenlan Pavilion, and writing and engraving more than 30 kinds of books, it is difficult to describe them all in detail. His hometown respected his fine reputation, and the literati admired his morality. Suddenly, he transformed, and his voice spread throughout the world. Therefore, I write this eulogy: 'The mountains and rivers of Huzhou are beautiful and nurturing, giving birth to great and lush talents. Holding jade and grasping jade, his virtues are pure and his learning is rich. He promoted industry and commerce, and was a leader in industry and commerce. National economy and people's livelihood all relied on him for remedy. He paid attention to culture and spread his name throughout the universe. His talent and virtue were both complete, and his brilliance and substance were equal. Suddenly, he rode a crane, and heaven did not bless him. His character is admirable, and his name is long-lasting.'"</p>
<h3>Assembly Sacrificial Text</h3>
<p>(1) On the 13th day of January in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the Huzhou Association of Shanghai, Huzhou Society, Zhejiang Huzhou Crepe Industry Association, the North Shanghai Middle School, the Huzhou Shanghai Small and Middle Schools, and the Nanxun Association, etc., respectfully offer clear wine and ordinary delicacies to the spirit of Mr. Xiangling, saying: "Alas, Heaven does not leave behind, and we have suddenly lost an elder statesman. The Star Rider's departure has shocked far and near. We respect the gentleman's bright and unique talent, born in Mingxi, and his family has inherited virtue. At a young age, he repeatedly gained fame. In the autumn wind, he forged his wings and dismissed his merits and fame. He ate a bowl of vegetable gruel and drank five dou of Pengze wine, holding a heart of indifference and maintaining a lofty self-respect. At a time when the world was in trouble, the government was reformed, and the governor summoned him. He refused the wheel of Pu and devoted himself to managing salt and affairs. The people of both Zhejiang provinces all pushed him as a giant. Taking advantage of his remaining courage, he reorganized the salt system, compiled the salt law, and planned in detail. The sea ban was opened and the rights and interests overflowed overseas. He manipulated finance, and he was the first to advocate for a commercial bank, naming it Xingye and starting in Asia. In the commercial war, he competed and improved the silk industry, invented manufacturing, and factories stood in forests. The gentleman's character can be a rule for the ancients, being humble in dealing with people and righteous in his heart.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou traffic is convenient, arriving in the evening after departing in the morning. Business and academic circles linked arms and arrived. He created the hometown association, and guests felt at home. He donated money to establish schools, and the buildings were majestic. He benefited his hometown, nurtured people and supported honesty, relieved poverty and benefited the people. It is difficult to describe with books. He preserved the essence of the nation and visited different books. He made up the missing books in Wenlan, and the storehouses were filled with precious books. He had many writings and did not enjoy being an official. He roamed through mountains and rivers and enjoyed famous sites. He paid tribute to the ancients from afar, discovered hidden secrets, and the breeze passed. People were gone, and tears flowed horizontally and vertically. The phoenix flew on the high hill, with disheveled hair in the wilderness. Facing the wind, he paid his respects with lychee, cinnabar, and plantain. The clouds of Song are dim, and the water is rippling. He speaks a thread of words, and the pain is clear, summoning the soul. Hopefully it will resonate." (2) On the 13th day of January in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the Huzhou Association of Shanghai, Huzhou Society, Zhejiang Huzhou Crepe Industry Association, the North Shanghai Middle School, the Huzhou Shanghai Small and Middle Schools, and the Nanxun Association, etc., respectfully offer clear wine and ordinary delicacies to the spirit of Zhou Bainian, saying: "Oh, Heaven blesses the Han people, the room is moved, and the revolutionaries are the first to realize the wind and electricity. The gentleman, with his handsome appearance, rose up and followed. He adhered to the doctrine, and the Southern Society opened wide. He united his comrades, lifted left and right. The Republic was rebuilt, and he raised our national flag. The gentleman held a pure character and also possessed heroic posture. He worked hard in his early years, and his learning was secretly probed. He was beautiful and elegant, and was good at talent. He joined the righteous army in the Northern Expedition and participated in military opportunities. He participated in secrets and connected with Zou Mei. He called and ran, walking on danger as if on flat ground. His spirit was courageous, and who could violate it? He mended the sky and refined stones, and did not give up after a hundred setbacks. The gentleman's talent and learning are both practical and universal. He declared diligence in the Party and the country, and his reputation was brilliant. When he entered the supervision, his style was rare in the world. He rectified discipline and swept away the vines. He eliminated the five turbidities, and his loyalty was an example. But Heaven did not bless him, and lost this ring. The country was not yet settled, and the nan wood was suddenly destroyed. The snow monkey wept, and the frost goose cried. I am from the same village as the gentleman, and my friendship is not private. I look up to the mountains and admire them, and my spirit relies on the water. I return to the South Forest and walk around with ropes. I use the red flag to summon him, and may his soul return."</p>
<h3>Report of Deeds</h3>
<p>After the meeting opened as scheduled, Yan Junxuan of the presidium first announced: "Today is the day for the six groups of fellow provincials from Huzhou to commemorate Mr. Zhou Xiangling and Mr. Zhou Bainian. We are grateful for the participation of all walks of life. Now, we invite Mr. Qiu Peihua and Mr. Chu Minyi to report on the deeds of the two gentlemen." Then, Qiu Peihua reported on the deeds of Zhou Xiangling, saying: "Mr. Xiangling's actions throughout his life included (1) being brave in doing things, (2) being generous and benevolent, (3) being diligent in learning, (4) being kind and loving to friends. Now that he has passed away, not only have our fellow villagers lost a pillar, but it is also a great misfortune for the country." Then, Chu Minyi reported on the deeds of Zhou Bainian, saying: "Now I will tell you what I know deeply. I am from the same village as Mr. Zhou Bainian, and we are also classmates. We studied in Dongying together. Mr. Zhou was proficient in national music and calligraphy. He eliminated superstition in his hometown and turned temples into schools, benefiting society. His life was sincere, and now we are holding a memorial service here. Minyi not only grieves for himself, but also regrets it for the country and society."</p>
<h3>Guest Speeches</h3>
<p>Next, Yu Youren gave a speech, saying: "Today, all walks of life are here to commemorate Mr. Zhou Xiangling and Mr. Zhou Bainian. Mr. Xiangling was studious and tireless throughout his life, and he wrote a lot. Archeology was especially his forte. Mr. Bainian and I worked together for many years. He was upright and selfless, and the spirits of the two gentlemen are worthy of admiration. They are also indispensable talents for society. Now that they have passed away one after another, how can we not regret it? The words and deeds of the two gentlemen can be a model for future generations. I hope that everyone will complete the unfinished ambitions of the two gentlemen, so as not to betray the original intention of the memorial service." In addition, Chu Huiseng, Pan Gongzhan, and Mo Liusheng gave speeches one after another, and the words are long and will not be recorded.</p>

<p>The elegies include: Chairman Lin's "Sacrificial Community", Wang Zhaoming's "Old Age and High Hopes", Ju Zheng's "Civilization Not Lost", Dai Chuanxian's "Embracing Classical Style", Ye Chuqian's "Literary Grace Shining", and Wang Zhaoming's couplet, "Every time I think of the fun of Qin, I remember his high knowledge," "I think of the mountain tour again, and I feel the accumulation of sorrow." Yu Youren's couplet, "Writing books on the Tianshan Mountains, being a study platform, often thinking of the two elders, their literary style and elegance will never die," "When the infantry's wine is over, the Zhongke's Qin is faint, sitting and forgetting for a morning and evening, the weather is cold and the frost and snow are mournful." He Yingqin's couplet, "The iron face is solemn, and the disciplinary outline helps to rectify," "The heroic soul is small, and the fairy road is desolate, and the wind and snow in the sky help to be miserable." In addition, the elegiac couplets from Party and state dignitaries such as Dai Chuanxian, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Chen Shaokuan, Chu Minyi, Luo Wengan, Zhu Jiahua, and Lu Dipeng are omitted.</p>
<p>###閘北 Starts Distributing Congee in the Freezing Weather</p>
<p>Requesting Assistance from the Xinwei Relief Society</p>
<p>The Xinwei Relief Society of this city received a letter yesterday from the Zhabei Charity Organization requesting assistance in order to start distributing congee to benefit the poor. The original letter stated, "Respectfully informing you, we previously received your esteemed society's reply and are deeply aware of your kindness and compassion. We are extremely grateful for your efforts in raising funds. Our organization is truly concerned about the widespread unemployment and large number of impoverished people in Zhabei, who are crying from hunger and suffering from the cold, which is truly pitiful. We plan to start distributing congee at the Second Congee Factory on Liuying Road on January 15th of the national calendar to save a large number of impoverished people from the cold. We respectfully request your society's assistance, for which we would be deeply grateful."</p>
<h3>Lofty Ambition of the National Crisis Propaganda Group: A 30,000-Li Expedition to Commence on the 20th of This Month from Shanghai, Lasting Two Years and Covering More Than Thirty Ports</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Crisis Propaganda Group, organized by Shen Yiqian and other students from the Shanghai Fine Arts School, embarked on a national crisis propaganda campaign in the Yangtze River, North China, and Mongolian border areas in February of last year. They endured numerous hardships and worked extremely hard. The group has now received financial assistance from the central government and Mayor Wu of this city and is scheduled to embark on another expedition on the 20th of this month, lasting two years, covering more than thirty ports, and traveling 30,000 li, truly a lofty undertaking.</p>
<h3>Purpose of This Trip</h3>
<p>According to the group leader, Mr. Shen Yiqian, the purpose of this trip is threefold: First, to carry out national crisis propaganda, such as holding national crisis art exhibitions, anti-Japanese war exhibitions, and national goods exhibitions, as well as screening lantern slides and distributing books and pamphlets. They will also provide local news outlets with texts and photographs for public dissemination to spread the seeds of patriotism. Second, to gather information on the actual conditions, such as the lives of various ethnic groups, industry and commerce, products, transportation, climate, etc., using text, drawings, photography, and other methods, to collect and compile them into books for various sectors to reference, in order to break down the barriers between north and south. Third, to promote national goods, collect local products, hold public exhibitions, and promote the goal of saving the country through production.</p>
<h3>Seven Members of the Group</h3>
<p>The members of the group embarking on this expedition are Shen Yiqian, Yu Chuangshuo, Zhang Yi, Wang Bin, Huang Zhaochang, Gu Tingpeng, and Mo Pu, a total of seven people, led by group leader Shen Yiqian. Mr. Shen is from Jiangsu Province and previously studied at a Japanese school in this city. He knew many Japanese friends in his daily life. His admission to the Shanghai Fine Arts School was also through Japanese introduction. However, since the September 18th Incident, Mr. Shen considered the national hatred irreconcilable and severed ties with all his Japanese acquaintances. The teachers and students of the Shanghai Fine Arts School all praised him. His resolute organization of the National Crisis Propaganda Group to engage in practical work is truly commendable.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Allocates Four Locomotives to Expedite Joint Transportation of Goods</h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau Slightly Repairs and Reorganizes Them</p>
<p>They Have Been Separately Put into Use Successively</p>
<p>In November of last year, a large quantity of goods for joint transportation across the river accumulated on the Jinpu Railway. The Ministry of Railways convened representatives from the Jinpu and Jinghu Railways to discuss ways to expedite the flow. It was decided that one train of through-transportation freight cars would run daily in both directions from Dakou, Tengxian, and Xuzhou to Shanghai, and from Linhuai Guan and Bengbu to Shanghai, Wuxi, or Changzhou. The Jinpu Railway would provide three locomotives and the Jinghu Railway would provide three to four trains of freight cars. Subsequently, the Ministry of Railways, considering that the locomotives of both railways were indeed insufficient, specially approved the allocation of four locomotives owned by the ministry for the exclusive use of these through-transportation freight cars. The locomotive department of this bureau has successively dispatched personnel to receive them. After the car workshop made slight repairs and reorganizations, they have been put into use separately.</p>

<h3>Verdict in the Tang Jiapeng Assassination Case</h3>
<p>Zhao Guangfu Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, also known as A Yu, a Ningbo native and former manager of the Rongji amusement park in the Great World, was assassinated in front of the Great World at 1:30 a.m. on June 18th of last year. A stray bullet also killed Wu Guangcai, a pedestrian from Yangzhou. The case was investigated by the special agency of the French Concession police, supervised by Chief Kim Ku-lin, and detectives arrested the culprits Zhang Xiaosizi, also known as Zhang Tinggui, from Funing, and Zhao Guangfu from Yangzhou. They also confiscated the handgun used by Zhao to commit the murder. They were handed over to the Second Special District Court for public prosecution on charges of premeditated murder. The details of the interrogation have been previously reported. The trial has now concluded. Yesterday morning, trial judge Wu Fangjun presided over the case in the First Criminal Court and ordered the two defendants to be brought to the court. Zhao Guangfu was sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiracy to commit murder and deprived of his civil rights for life. Zhang Xiaosizi was sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment for assisting in the conspiracy to commit murder and deprived of his civil rights for life.

After the sentences were pronounced, the defendants were transferred to the detention center to await the expiration of the appeal period before being sent to prison.</p>
<h3>Murder Suspects From Yancheng Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Ling Youxin and His Son Are Major Suspects</p>
<p>Both Firmly Deny After Arrest</p>
<p>Fu Ruixiang, a 21-year-old man from Yancheng, Jiangbei, was severely beaten by five or six fellow villagers in Lijiazhuang, his hometown, on October 18th of last year for demanding repayment of a debt, resulting in Fu's death from serious injuries. Fu Ruixiang's father, Fu Yansheng, reported the incident to the Yancheng County government for examination and filed a complaint accusing the murderers Ling Jicheng, Ling Mazi, and others. The county government ordered a strict search, but the Lings had already fled upon hearing the news. Only Ling Jicheng's wife, Ling Jishi, was arrested, interrogated several times, and detained. After investigation, Fu learned that Ling Jishi's husband's brother Ling Youxin and Ling Yafeng, father and son, were involved in the case and had fled to No. 3937 Daxu Lane, Robert Road, in the Shanghai Public Concession. He came to Shanghai alone and secretly confirmed the information. He hired lawyer Pan Fengtang to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, requesting an investigation. The court approved the request and issued an arrest warrant, which was delivered to the Putuo Road Police Station. Detective Xu Huanxiao and Bao Tan Zhang Changkun, along with Fu Yansheng, secretly went to Daxu Lane at 5 p.m. the day before yesterday and arrested Ling Youxin (a 60-year-old man from Jiangbei) and Ling Yafeng (a 37-year-old man from Jiangbei), father and son, and took them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian presented the details of the case, requesting that the Lings be detained pending notification of the Yancheng County government to bring them back. Fu Yansheng stated that his son, Fu Ruixiang, was murdered by five or six people in Lijiazhuang, Yancheng. The prosecutor examined the body, and he filed a complaint with the county government. Later, he learned that Ling Youxin and his son were involved and had fled to Shanghai, so he tracked them to Shanghai and arrested them. He submitted the indictment and requested that the Lings be detained so that he could report back to the county government. When questioned, the Ling father and son denied assisting in the murder of Fu Ruixiang and jointly hired lawyer Jiang Yiping, stating that Ling Yafeng had brought his wife and children to Shanghai in January of the lunar calendar and was working as a laborer in the Zhaofeng Garden managed by the Public Works Department, earning 6 jiao per day, and was still working there without taking leave, so how could he have committed a crime in Jiangbei? This is truly unjust and the police should be ordered to investigate this point. His father, Ling Youxin, had been teaching in his hometown. In August of this year, he came to Shanghai after hearing the news that Yafeng's wife had died in Shanghai and had not returned. Furthermore, Fu Yansheng's complaint did not mention the names of the Ling father and son, so they were being falsely accused. Judge Wu Tingqi ordered the case to be postponed pending the arrival of documents from the Yancheng County government for further verification. The Lings were detained due to the seriousness of the case.</p>
<h3>Rice Boat Owner Suddenly Assassinated</h3>
<p>Shot While Walking With His Wife</p>
<p>The Reason for the Murder Remains Unknown</p>
<p>At around 9:30 last night, Jia Longgen, a 34-year-old man from Tangqiao Town, Pudong, who lived at No. 5 Kaitai Lane, Fengji Wharf, Nanshi, and worked in the rice boat business, was assassinated. He only had an elderly mother at home. Because of poverty, he became an adopted son-in-law to Shen Desheng, who operated a rice boat, and changed his name to Shen Adong. Therefore, he was known as Adong in the rice market. He was known as Jia Longgen. His wife, Amei, is 25 years old this year and is quite beautiful and fond of dressing up. Therefore, the couple lived in harmony. They owned two rice boats and personally operated them, transporting rice between Songjiang and Shanghai. Recently, two months ago, Jia Longgen fell ill, so they hired another boatman, and the couple moved ashore to the upstairs of No. 5. Amei also worked as a shaman (commonly known as a fortune teller), so she sometimes treated others for illness, which made their life slightly easier. Yesterday afternoon, around 8 o'clock, Li Xinzhi, a friend of Longgen who lived near the Wanchun Sauce Garden in Xuejia Bang, hired Amei to treat him because he was ill. The couple went out together. When they returned home, it was about 9:30. When Amei suddenly remembered that the patient still needed to send ghost horse papers, she turned around to go. Unexpectedly, at that time, a gunshot was suddenly heard from behind, and Longgen, who was walking with her, fell to the ground. Amei was flustered and only cared about her husband, forgetting about the murderer, so the thug escaped. Afterwards, the patrol police arrived after hearing the sound, but the murderer was gone. Only the body was lying on the side of the road, and his wife was crying beside him. They reported to the First District and First Precinct and inspected the scene. Amei was taken to the precinct for questioning. Today, at around 4 p.m., the court examined the body and found that he was assassinated by a thug. The bullet entered from the back of the head and exited from the eyebrow. The head was facing east and the feet were facing west. He was wearing a blue wool coat, a khaki flannel robe, felt shoes, and a duckbill cap. After the examination, the family prepared a coffin to collect the body. However, the underlying cause remains unknown. It is only hoped that the authorities will conduct a strict investigation so that the truth can be revealed.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Creek Blocked Again</h3>
<p>Boats Traverse the Water Surface</p>
<p>Visible for One or Two Li From a Distance</p>
<p>Suzhou Creek in this city is a transportation hub for inland rivers. The small ferries traveling to and from various places in Jiangsu and Zhejiang pass through the creek. The food, vegetables, and goods supplied to the residents of the city are also transported to Shanghai via this waterway. It is an important channel for inland water transportation. Last Saturday, it was blocked due to low tide and many boats. The water police station managed to clear it and allow passage. Unexpectedly, it was blocked again yesterday, and the number of boats blocked was even greater than before. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Waterway Was Blocked on Tuesday and Wednesday. After the water police station managed to clear the blocked area, a large number of cargo ships arrived in Shanghai one after another on Friday night. When they reached the western section of Suzhou Creek in front of the Yangzhu Factory, the departing ships also arrived one after another. Due to the extremely cold weather and low tide, the arriving and departing boats were blocked again from that point. It was reported that several cargo ships were stranded in the river and could not move, causing more and more people to gather on both sides. The eastern section, starting from the Tianhou Palace Bridge, was completely blocked all the way to the front of the Yangzhu Factory.</p>
<p>Boats Stopped. Looking from the Old Garbage Bridge towards both sides, the river was full of boats, and the water surface was barely visible. The sounds of boatmen squeezing, jostling, and arguing filled the air. In the blocked section of the river, the boats traversed the water surface, and pedestrians could walk across the boats in the river without wading. From west to east, the small ferries, boats, barges, sailing boats, and other vessels of various sizes blocked totaled one or two thousand, stretching for one or two li.</p>
<p>Water Police Clearing. Yesterday, the water police station dispatched patrol boats and police officers to Suzhou Creek to clear the blocked waterway and restore traffic. However, it was impossible to move those stranded in the middle section. From morning to noon, the water police tried their best to clear the waterway, but it was still not possible to pass. It is now reported that the ships on both sides have been ordered to retreat, and it may be possible to clear the waterway today, but it is still uncertain.</p>
<p>Impact on Ferries. Due to the blockage of the waterway, many ferries were unable to operate. Larger inland river vessels with scheduled routes temporarily changed their routes to travel along the outer river, which is farther than the inner river. The most affected were the cargo and passenger ships from the inland areas that came to Shanghai to sell goods, as they were blocked and unable to enter. There were also many who loaded goods to leave Shanghai but were unable to leave the river, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to Open a Nanshi National Goods Market Next Spring</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce considers promoting national goods to be an urgent priority. Twenty years ago, it established a national goods market at the original site of the chamber's product exhibition hall. Over the years, the business has been very prosperous. The chamber considers this year to be the Year of Women's National Goods, and it is especially important to promote the national goods industry. Therefore, it has added a Nanshi National Goods Market at the former site of the Xiaonamen Zhonghua Road County Chamber of Commerce, so that residents in the Nanshi area can purchase nearby. The area is densely populated and bustling, no less than the concession, and business will definitely become more prosperous in the future. It is heard that the chamber is now actively preparing, and it is scheduled to officially open in March next spring.</p>
<h3>Bandit Den Cracked on Guling Road</h3>
<p>Eight Male and Female Bandits Arrested</p>
<p>The Avenue Edward VII Police Station, based on information from informants, said that No. 91 Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, was a bandit den. The police chief ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to surround the house from the front and back doors. After opening the front door, the detectives bravely entered and arrested seven bandits on the spot. At that time, a female bandit was upstairs. Suddenly hearing that the police were rushing to arrest her, she jumped out of the window gap and escaped to the neighboring No. 89 sun deck and into the attic. Then she went downstairs and out of the alley, hoping to escape. However, she was discovered by the arresting officers, who followed her and finally caught her. She was taken to the Xinzha Police Station and sent to court this morning for punishment.</p>
<h3>YMCA Requests Allocation of Land for Downtown Branch</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government moved to the downtown area, various sectors have invested in the area to start businesses. The Shanghai YMCA recently submitted a request to the municipal government for the allocation of land to build a clubhouse. The municipal government, considering that the YMCA has always served the community and made significant contributions, ordered the Municipal Downtown Construction Committee to review the request and report back before issuing a decision. The YMCA's submission is excerpted as follows: "Submitting a request for the allocation of land in the downtown area to build a branch for community service, requesting approval. Since the outbreak of the national crisis and the subsequent January 28th Incident, the situation in Shanghai has changed dramatically. The community's need for our association is increasing day by day, and our association's work is therefore becoming more important. Our association is working even harder to meet the expectations of the public. The Shanghai Municipal Government's downtown area construction is actively underway, and the Jiangwan area is becoming the center of the city. The future prosperity can be foreseen. However, at the beginning of construction, everything must be newly built, and the public must be given a new environment and a new life. The municipal government's plan to transform the lives of millions of people in Shanghai is already in place. Our association, as a community organization, should follow the changes in society and promote the work that should be done, such as promoting moral education, holding lectures, imparting knowledge, promoting physical education, publicizing culture, leading youth, and children, all of which are to guide the public into the right path and supplement the government's policies where they are lacking, and change customs imperceptibly. Therefore, we plan to build a park-style clubhouse in the downtown area, occupying approximately 15 mu of land, so that association members can have a proper place to relax after work, and our association can also carry out community service work. The Capital YMCA was founded by Premier Sun Yat-sen, and the land for the association was donated by the Premier in the early years of the Republic. The land for the Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Beiping, and Northeast China YMCA branches was also provided by the government. Our association has no foundation, and the funds needed for work are all from the generous donations of people in the community. The municipal government has always supported our association's work, and the purpose of building the downtown area is to seek the welfare of the public. Our association's construction of a clubhouse in the downtown area in the future will also serve the public, which should also be a part of the downtown area plan. Therefore, we dare to ask the municipal government to allocate a centrally located piece of land so that our association can begin preparations. If our request is granted, the public will be deeply grateful. All reasons for requesting the allocation of land in the downtown area are respectfully submitted for review and approval. We humbly request instructions to follow. Respectfully submitted by Wu, Mayor of Shanghai, Wang Zhengting, President, Cao Yunxiang, Chairman of the Board, and Lu Ganchen, General Secretary of the Shanghai Chinese Christian Youth Association."</p>
<h3>Trial Opens in Football Referee Injury Case</h3>
<p>Shen Huichun Has Not Yet Recovered</p>
<p>Shen Huichun, a member of the Shanghai Chinese Sports Referees Association, was allegedly injured by Jiaotong University students for unfair refereeing in a football match between Jida and Jiaotong University at the Jiaotong University stadium. Shen Huichun reported the injury to the procuratorate of the local court and requested an investigation. He was summoned to court and instructed to file a lawsuit with the special court due to jurisdictional issues. Shen Huichun believed that the area was indeed in the Chinese territory, so he resubmitted a complaint to the procuratorate. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu again summoned Shen Huichun to court for a preliminary hearing and instructed him to leave and await instructions. Shen Huichun is from Suzhou, 23 years old, and lives at No. 16 Jiujiang Road. He is an employee of the China-Italy Bank. It is said that the injuries he suffered have not yet healed.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Will Hold an Award Ceremony for the Fire Brigade Today</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau believes that the fire brigades in various districts of Shanghai, including South Shanghai, North Shanghai, Zhenru, Jiangwan, Wusong, and Pudong, remained in their defense areas throughout the January 28th Incident, maintaining local fire safety and making great contributions. In addition, they performed well in the fire safety technology demonstration on National Day last year. Therefore, it specially reported the case to the municipal government for awards. Mayor Wu has now issued 36 gold special awards, 336 silver Class A awards, 76 Class B fire safety awards, 16 award flags, and two large silver cups, ordering the Public Security Bureau to redistribute them to the meritorious personnel. For the sake of ceremony, the Public Security Bureau has scheduled a gathering of representatives from various fire brigades at the bureau at 2 p.m. today to hold an award ceremony.

<h3>The American Anlun Collides With a Stone Slab Boat</h3>
<p>The Wang Linji barge, registration number 13314, from Baiguan, carrying 100 tons of Suzhou stone slabs, was hit by the American Anlun of the Meifu Petroleum Company at about 10 a.m. on December 20th of last year, opposite the New Meifu Wharf. The Anlun was first heading towards Puxi, but suddenly backed up towards Pudong and violently struck the stone slab boat. The boat was struck to the east wharf of the Meifu Wharf, and colliding with the wharf, the boat and cargo completely sank, with losses of over 8,000 yuan. It has been reported to the Shanghai Coal and Stone Barge Trade Association, which is negotiating with the Meifu Company on the basis of reason.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai National Goods Company's Second Plan is Active</h3>
<p>Amidst Weak Purchasing Power</p>
<p>The Company is Not Affected</p>
<p>Since the enemy's invasion of Shanghai on January 28th, all industries have been affected, resulting in a general economic downturn in society. This month, as winter approaches and the weather is slightly colder, social purchasing power is even weaker. The Shanghai National Goods Company, located opposite the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road, decided to hold a large-scale promotion of women's national goods, starting on the 6th of this month, as part of its second plan for the year. The goods selected are of high quality and the prices are low, which is unprecedented. Therefore, although social purchasing power is weak, the company's daily sales statistics are not affected, and are increasing daily. The total sales on the 11th exceeded the daily target by 196.38%. Sales from the 12th onwards exceeded by 125.08%. The average increase for the two days was over 160%, which is even better than the average for the past five days. The reason is that those who love to buy national goods trust companies that completely sell national goods and do not have any concerns. Another reason is that the company introduces inexpensive and beautiful goods to women in separate sessions and departments, which can indeed sacrifice profits and attract buyers. For example, today's sale of 6.8 jiao per foot of genuine silk patriotic crepe, 3.5 jiao per pound of Guangdong first-class kapok, 1.4 jiao per foot of floral line riding pants, 5 jiao each for a domestic brand thermos, 5 pairs for one yuan of double-thread men's socks, 5.5 jiao each for a Guan Le Ming fountain pen, 9.5 jiao each for a Ya Pu Er electric bulb, 4.8 yuan each for a children's coat, and a buy-one-get-one-free Bakelite appliance set are all genuine sacrifices and low-priced goods.</p>

<h3>Executive Committee of the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association</h3>
<p>Mutual Election of Standing Committee Members, Chairman and Vice-Chairman</p>
<p>And Discussion of the Chinese Businessmen's Self-Defense Corps Issue</p>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association held its first Executive Committee meeting of the third session yesterday at 2:00 PM inside the Shandong Guild Hall on Ximen Road. The following committee members were present: Zhou Qinpu, Cheng Zhusun, Li Weiliang, Dong Kechang, Wang Shunqing, Du Gang, Mao Yun, Du Yuesheng, (Cheng represented by) Bei Zairong, Xu Xiuting, Wu Xiu, (Du represented by) Huang Degu, (Wang represented by) Cai Hongtian, (Mao represented by) Zhu Shengmao, Shang Mujiang, (Zhu represented by) Tong Lizhang, Qu Zhenhua, Gong Jingyan, (Qu represented by), 18 people. Also present were Zhang Gengshan, (Wu Guowei represented by) Lou Hongjun, (Zhu represented by) Shao Baoxing, and three others, totaling 21 people. Cheng Zhusun was publicly elected as Chairman, and Shao Bing was the recorder. After formalities, the Chairman gave a report, stating that the purpose of today's meeting was to mutually elect the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and Standing Committee members. Because the number of executive committee members has increased by four in this session, and the number of Standing Committee members was five in the previous session, the number should be increased by two to a total of seven. The proposal was unanimously approved without dissent. Next, Zhang Gengshan, representing Wu Guowei, proposed that anyone elected as a Chinese Director or Chinese Committee member, whose duties are already burdensome, should not concurrently hold positions as Executive or Supervisory Committee members of this association. The Chairman put the matter to discussion. Tong Lizhang stated that this matter concerns the regulations of the association and that the regulations should be amended first before it can be implemented according to the rules. Li Weiliang, Shao Baoxing, and others seconded the motion. It was resolved that the opinions would be handed over to the committee responsible for drafting amendments to the regulations. Next, there was a discussion about alternate committee members attending meetings and being able to perform the duties of formal committee members when they are absent, with responsibility limited to one occasion. After Mao Yun explained the above opinion, there was no dissent. The Chairman stated that amending the regulations was of utmost importance, and a number of drafting committee members should be appointed first. It was resolved to publicly elect Cheng Zhusun, Qu Zhenhua, Huang Xianggu, Mao Yun, and Tong Lizhang as members of the committee. Next, Wang Shunqing proposed to revive the Chinese Businessmen's Self-Defense Corps. After the Chairman reported on the preparation process in detail, Mao Yun, Qu Zhenhua, Tong Lizhang, Li Weiliang, and others successively advocated that the Self-Defense Corps must be established. It was resolved to first, based on the original plan prepared last time, send a letter to the French authorities, inquiring about the reasons why the establishment has not yet been approved. The letter should also detail that the French Concession was the first to advocate the establishment, and now the Public Concession has approved the establishment of a Special Police Chinese Corps, which has achieved excellent results so far. This is sufficient to show that this type of organization does not conflict with the government's administration, and it is beneficial to local business without any harm. Similarly, the past Chinese Volunteer Corps in the French Concession also had good results. It seems there is no harm in starting implementation as soon as possible. However, all implementation methods, in addition to the existing basic members (i.e., members of the Chinese Volunteer Corps), will be discussed and implemented in detail once formal approval is obtained. Next, Li Weiliang reported on the theft case at the Yonghua Company on Xinxiao Street, French Avenue. It was unanimously agreed that, as it is the dead of winter and there are many thieves, in addition to requesting protection from the French authorities, citizens within the concession should be notified to pay attention to prevention. After the above cases were discussed, the mutual election of the Chairman and Standing Committee members began. Du Yuesheng was elected as Chairman, and Cheng Zhusun and Shang Mujiang were elected as Vice-Chairmen, all of whom were re-elected. Xu Xiuting, Qu Zhenhua, Mao Yun, Huang Xianggu, Li Weiliang, Zhu Shengmao, and Gong Jingyan were elected as Standing Committee members. It was also decided that the inauguration and oath-taking ceremony for the Chinese Directors, Chinese Committee members, and Executive and Supervisory Committee members would be held within the 20th of this month. The date will be determined by Chairman Du. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>After the Recovery of Xiamen, Chinese Merchants' Ships Resume Sailing</h3>
<p>However, Passenger and Cargo Volumes Sharply Decline Due to the Impact of War</p>
<p>Since the Fujian Incident, all Chinese merchant shipping companies have, according to the order of the Ministry of Transportation, uniformly stopped sailing to ports in Fujian Province, such as Fuzhou, Xiamen, Xinghua, Quanzhou, Shacheng, etc. However, foreign merchant ships continue to sail as usual, resulting in the monopolization of passenger and cargo transportation by foreign ships. For example, the Jiesheng, which sails on the Shanghai-Fuzhou line, has excellent business on each voyage from Fuzhou to Shanghai. Now that Xiamen has been recovered by the Navy, Chinese merchant ships can resume sailing to Xiamen as usual. The Yuan'an, which was scheduled to sail the Nanhua route from Shanghai yesterday by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, originally planned to dock at Xiamen. However, because passenger and cargo traffic from Shanghai to Xiamen has disappeared since the Fujian Incident, and cargo from Xiamen to Shanghai has also sharply declined, it still stopped docking. Whether it will dock at Xiamen when returning to Shanghai from Guangdong depends on whether there are passengers and cargo at Xiamen at that time.</p>
<h3>Labor Strike at the Old Tin Packaging Plant of the British American Tobacco Company</h3>
<p>The Labor Union Petitions the Party and Government for Mediation</p>
<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, the workers in the tin packaging section of the old factory of the British American Tobacco Company in Pudong recently went on strike due to the factory's change of closing time and confiscation of worker ID cards. Yesterday, they went on strike as usual and will be able to work as usual tomorrow. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Labor Strike</h3>
<p>The tin packaging section of the old factory of the British American Tobacco Company in Lujiazui employs more than 100 long-term workers and about 1,000 temporary female workers. Traditionally, they enter the factory at 7:00 AM every day and leave for lunch at 11:45 AM, returning to work at 12:50 PM. Recently, the factory changed the lunch break to 11:50 AM. The workers expressed dissatisfaction with the sudden change. The day before yesterday, after the female workers went for lunch, they entered the factory at around 12:00 PM, but unexpectedly, the boxes for the worker ID cards were removed. After the workers entered the factory, they could not work because they had no ID cards, so they had to leave the factory as a whole and report to the labor union. Negotiations by the labor union were still unsuccessful. At 5:00 PM, a general meeting of the tin packaging workers was held, and it was decided that (yesterday, Saturday, was a day off) starting from Monday, they would enter the factory to work as usual and would not recognize the factory's change of time.</p>
<h3>Petition for Mediation</h3>
<p>The Fifth District Cigarette Industry Labor Union, on the grounds that the factory changed working hours and confiscated work cards, leading to disputes, has now decided through a general meeting to start working as usual on Monday, but the working hours will still follow the old practice. Fearing that the factory will change again and cause disputes, they specially petitioned the Municipal Party Department Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to request the dispatch of personnel for mediation to avoid disturbances.</p>
<h3>The Copper and Iron Industry Association Dispatches Personnel to Seal Off Smuggled Iron</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Xiangfeng Foundry in this city was previously found to be using smuggled iron and was warned by the Copper and Iron Industry Association. Later, it was found that this smuggled iron was from Xiangtai Ironworks. After Xiangfeng was warned by the association, it did not mend its ways and continued to use smuggled iron, which was again discovered by the association. Xiangtai and Xiangfeng, as well as the Iron Industry Association, were invited to discuss and resolve that the smuggled iron would be sealed off. In the future, all members of the same industry would not be allowed to use it. Unexpectedly, Xiangfeng outwardly complied but secretly continued to use the smuggled iron. The association believed that Xiangfeng was a member of the same industry and had the right to interfere. The association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting a resolution. The Copper and Iron Industry Association specially held a regular meeting at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, and most of the committee members raised the issue of how to deal with Xiangfeng Foundry, which ignored the advice, repeatedly violated the resolution, and privately used smuggled iron. It was resolved to recommend committee member Zhang Zilian to contact the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting the dispatch of personnel to weigh and seal off the smuggled iron to ensure prudence and avoid repeating the mistakes.</p>

<h3>Women's National Products Year New Ersanchun Style Lona Silk</h3>

Department stores are also doing their best to promote national products in the hope that women across the country will adopt them.

<h3>Chinese Take Over Laodeji Soda Factory</h3>
<p>No. 94 Yulin Road, the Laodeji Dutch Water Factory, was founded by Westerners and has a history of 80 years. It is the pioneer of soda in China and holds Business License No. 1 from the Shanghai Municipal Council. In the beginning, it only provided drinks for people in the west of Shanghai. Later, many Chinese people also drank it. The various sodas it produces, with their excellent materials, appropriate ingredients, and fresh and delicious taste, are indeed superior to all other brands on the market. However, in recent years, the successors of the founders are old and frail and have no intention of promoting it, so it is rarely sold on the market except to Westerners. Last year, it was taken over by Chinese who raised funds to acquire it and renamed it Laodeji Soda Company. An office was added on the third floor of the Jiangnan Bank on Paoqiu Chang Road, Henan Road. All the original technicians and employees, who had been with the Westerners for twenty or thirty years, remained. After the takeover, this reporter was invited by technician Mr. Liu of the company to visit. The layout of its machinery and various equipment are more complete than other factories. Its factory building is also specially constructed, which is unmatched by other factories. The water used is filtered through sand and then sterilized with ultraviolet light to kill bacteria. The spices are all from a factory in England. After the empty bottles are washed inside and out by machine, they are rinsed with distilled water. After the soda is bottled, each bottle is inspected, and any water with minute dust particles is discarded and not sold. No effort is spared in ensuring hygiene, so it has been able to thrive for eighty years without failing. The company is determined to work hard to promote and step up production this spring so that Chinese people can drink top-quality domestic soda. This is also good news in the national products industry.</p>

After an investigation into the cause of the fire, it was found that the factory's old servant, Xu Yindi, was careless while cooking dinner, causing the fire. The fire destroyed a two-story building and a large overhanging building, resulting in significant losses.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<p>Regarding Choosing a Subject to Study [&gt;P</p>
<p>Several Questions about Purpose (Continued)</p>
<p>In many applications, a person often lists three or four, or even five or six, or more subjects to study. For example, wanting to study both literature and science, as well as other subjects such as architecture and automotive engineering. Whether studying several subjects at the same time will conflict and reduce efficiency is a question that remains to be discussed, but due to limited time, if one studies several subjects at the same time, the result will inevitably be neglecting one thing for another, achieving nothing. We dare to assert this. Regarding this point, Mr. Shao Guoquan's letter of inquiry is proof: "...Fortunately, the working hours of my job are very few, only five hours on average per day... So I study English at your newspaper's night school and Chinese at a certain society. But after a semester, studying two subjects seems to be mentally taxing, resulting in no progress. Speaking of my personality, I like both Chinese and English equally, and I need them equally in my career. Sir, in this situation, should I give up one, or continue with both simultaneously?" Our reply to Mr. Shao is: "If you find it difficult to study both, then rather than forcing yourself to continue, neglecting one for the other, it is better to focus on one subject and gain more benefit." If someone with as much free time as Mr. Shao still feels this difficulty, the harm of studying multiple subjects can be imagined. Therefore, we hope that participants who like to study several subjects at the same time should first choose the one they like the most and need the most.</p>
<p>It is a fact that mastering a language is a prerequisite for learning, especially in China, because of its cultural backwardness. Studying science requires reading foreign books. Therefore, learning a foreign language has become the main subject in today's schools, the prerequisite for reading. However, learning a foreign language takes at least two or three years, and even then, one may not be able to master it. Therefore, while learning a foreign language is extremely necessary, one also needs to consider their own learning environment. Therefore, many participants intend to learn a foreign language in order to read social sciences or natural sciences. Regarding this, we believe that two prerequisite questions must be resolved: (1) Is there enough time? (2) Is it for specialized research or just to gain general knowledge? If it is only to gain general knowledge and there is not enough time, then learning a foreign language is largely unnecessary. Because if one spends too much time learning a foreign language, and as a result, the foreign language is not mastered and the subject one wants to read is not learned at all, it is the most uneconomical thing. Moreover, this issue can be discussed from two aspects. Social sciences in China seem to be more developed than natural sciences in recent times, and there are quite a few translated books and newspapers in terms of quantity, enough for those of us who only want to understand practical life to study.</p>
<p>As we were writing this article, we received a letter from Mr. Yu Wanwang, who raised the question of "Which is more important, natural science or social science?" We have a lot to say about this question and will discuss it separately tomorrow. We will put it aside for now.</p>
<p>In conclusion: Although we have a considerable understanding of the readers' learning environment, we cannot directly and bluntly let readers learn a certain subject. We can only, according to their living environment, suggest how to make the books they read beneficial, not futile, and not take unnecessary detours. As for which subject to choose to study, it should still be proposed by the reader in a "study plan." However, we are willing to be in the position of an observer, to discuss the proposed plan and do our best to fulfill the responsibility of an "experienced guide."</p>

<h3>Shen Huichun Assault Incident: Court to Hold Hearing Tomorrow at 2:00 PM Still at the District Court</h3>
<p>During the Jiaotong University, Jinan University, and Jiangnan University football match, referee Shen Huichun was assaulted by Jiaotong University students. Shen hired lawyer Yan Ersen last week to file a lawsuit in the District Court. A preliminary hearing has already been held once. However, the prosecutor ordered Shen to file a lawsuit in the Special District Court because the Jiaotong University campus is located on an extraterritorial road. However, Shen argued that although the Jiaotong University gate is on an extraterritorial road, the police authority is still in the hands of the Public Security Bureau. The District Court then agreed to accept the case and is now scheduled to hold a hearing tomorrow at 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Cheers Erupt at the Baseball Field: Donghua Defeats Huasaises Again 1-2. Both Sides' Artistic Performances are Wonderful and Exciting. The Focus of Victory Depends on Accurate Shooting. Western Concession Police Force Loses to French Business School 1-2.</h3>
<p>In the Western League Group A competition, Donghua had previously defeated Huasaises by a score of 2-1. Commentators said that Huasaises only had ten players at the time, so their defeat was justified. Yesterday afternoon, the two teams played their second Western League Group A match at the baseball field. In front of 5,000 spectators, they fought fiercely for ninety minutes. As a result, Donghua defeated Huasaises again by the same score of 2-1. Huasaises, who were regarded highly in Shanghai, were also willing to submit at this time and had to dejectedly pack up their remaining forces and leave.</p>
<h3>Deliberately Seeking Strength and Restoring Fame</h3>
<p>Donghua suffered a setback at the hands of Jinan University last week, and their fame was greatly damaged. Those in charge gathered everyone to discuss the aftermath. In order to strive for revival, they relied on reorganizing the team. After the swearing-in ceremony, they indeed increased training every day. The strength of the troops was strengthened, and the spirit was enhanced. Even strong enemies like Huasaises were defeated. If this continues, Donghua should be watched with new eyes. Looking at the situation on that day, the forwards ran and passed, while the opponent excelled in internal defense and resistance. Donghua was more stable. The focus of the victory or defeat of both sides lay in the number of people who were good at shooting. The British troops had A Qiao alone, while Donghua had Dai and Li. When the opportunity came, the outcome was different.</p>
<h3>Yunyou's Appearance Brings a Fresh Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Donghua's recent setbacks were due to the entire army's laxity. The absence of midfielder Feng Yunyou due to illness was also one of the reasons. Yesterday, Mr. Feng took the field to fight. Although he was weak after his illness, he still worked hard and cooperated with the heroes. Coupled with the amazing performances of Tu Kaiyuan and Wu Youliang, the midfield line felt vibrant. Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, and Guan Xun'an's skills are superb, and everyone knows it. Wan Xianghua and Jia Youliang each had wonderful crosses. Wan and Jia both contributed considerably to the two winning goals. Dai Linjing was the first to make a contribution, and Li Yichen was the one who decided the fate of the victory or defeat. The two were accurate and skillful in shooting. It is now increasingly believed that those who ran all over the field and chased the ball tirelessly were Tu Kaiyuan on the inside and Chen Hongguang on the outside.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Formation is Tidy, but Shooting is Poor</h3>
<p>Huasaises' second defeat at the hands of Donghua was probably beyond their expectations. The closeness of the entire team's cooperation and the strength of the front and rear offense and defense were sometimes better than Donghua's. The only drawback was that the forwards lacked shooting talent compared to Donghua. Often, when they were at the city gates, they panicked and didn't know what to do, shooting aimlessly everywhere. Goalkeeper Herbert was a first-class talent. The two goals conceded were beyond human ability, but the number of saves he made was more than double the number of goals conceded, so his contribution was enough to offset the losses. Tao Lewei, the veteran, had an imposing manner. Smith, the midfielder, was indeed extraordinary. The five forwards ran fast and passed well, but only A Qiao could shoot.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Gains Momentum, Donghua is in Trouble</h3>
<p>After the whistle blew to start the battle, Huasaises immediately launched a full-scale attack on Donghua's defense. Feng Yunyou, who was fighting while ill, tried his best to defend, but both attempts were ineffective. Li Yichen and Xiao Wan launched a counterattack in succession, but were intercepted by Smith. Kang Budeng and A Qiao gained momentum and came again. Li Ning waved them out of the door. A Qiao was the only dangerous person on the other side, galloping on horseback on Donghua's back line. Fortunately, Lao Zhou's hands and feet were steady, and he was not poisoned. Huasaises' forwards attacked repeatedly but did not lose heart because of it. They gathered around Donghua's penalty area and attacked repeatedly. Tu and Wu, two defenders, rescued dangerous balls one after another. Li Ning was magnificent, and the enemy was frightened when they saw him.</p>
<h3>Youliang Penetrates Deeply, Linjing's Contribution</h3>
<p>After a long time of back and forth, it was still difficult to open the scoring. Guan Xun'an rescued a dangerous ball, picking and sending it to the center. Smith headed it back. Feng Yunyou hooked it sideways, and Hongguang got it. He took a few steps forward, and Weston rushed at him in a shocking manner. Hongguang was cunning and passed it to Jia. Jia dribbled the ball straight down, breaking through three levels. Tao Lewei entangled desperately, but slipped and fell, causing a catastrophic disaster. The ball was hooked by Jia in front of the goal. Agerton and Harickton misunderstood each other. The center forward Dai took the opportunity to rush forward a few steps and kicked it in with a bang. Cheers erupted from all around. Donghua led 1-0 in the first half.</p>
<h3>A Qiao Shoots Angrily, Tying the Score</h3>
<p>Time passed, and the war drums sounded again. After switching defenses, Donghua suddenly found themselves in an attacking position. However, Smith was very powerful, monitoring Dai and not leaving him for a moment. Li Yichen could not break through and dribble in, so he shot from 30 yards away. It was extremely accurate. Herbert fell to the ground and pushed it out, avoiding a major disaster. Ten minutes later, Kang Budeng and A Qiao, under Smith's orders, galloped away, arriving at Donghua's defense in an instant. Wu Youliang could not stop them, and Guan Xun'an could not block them again. In the penalty area, shadows were chaotic. A Qiao, relying on his strong feet, shot angrily. Zhou's iron gate's line of sight was blocked by people, so it became a tie.</p>
<h3>Xianghua Cheers, Yichen Unleashes His Power</h3>
<p>Since the situation was balanced</p>
<p>, the battle became more intense. Xianghua got the ball as fast as a galloping horse, and Harick could not catch up. Agterton was tricked in front, and the ball flew along the low line in front of the goal. Dai Linjing was unprepared in a hurry, so he missed this good opportunity. There was a sigh from all around. Before long, Hongguang got Xianghua's long pass again and shot hard at the goal, but it was one foot away from the goal. Xianghua did not give up his ambition. With Yichen's help, he entered the encirclement again. At a considerable point, he crossed it beautifully. Tao Lewei and Smith did not occupy the commanding heights. Li Yichen shot horizontally and low, rubbing against the goal post and going in. Herbert was caught off guard and lost a city. After this, although Huasaises always thought of restoring their territory, Donghua's defense was tight, and they were never able to succeed, so they lost by a score of 2-1.</p>

Therefore, Donghua and Jinan University may still have a chance. At present, Donghua has three losses and one draw, and Jinan University has one loss and one draw.

<h3>Davis Cup: The United States Hopes to Use Wood and Shields This Year and Will Practice Hard Again</h3>
<p>(London Reuters) The United States has today reaffirmed its determination to win back the Davis Cup and will form a strong team with Shields Wood and other athletes. During this cold month, they are required to practice at least once a week. The Shields and others will focus their efforts on attacking techniques, practicing net play and pressing. They will be guided by former American Davis Cup players.</p>
<p>Prentice, chairman of the American Davis Cup Committee, said in his supplementary report that although our chances in 1934 are bleak, I am personally not disappointed. I have full faith in Lord. He has no intention of entering the industry. His doubles with Fan Ling are still a unique force in the world and can still contribute to the Davis Cup. Wood, the 1931 Wimbledon champion, will also be used this year. Wood has had outstanding results in the past few years. There are still many other athletes available. We are aware that there are strong enemies such as Australia, Japan, and France in front of us. Britain has Pan Lei and Austin, waiting to make sure the treatment is after the game. You must have very good tennis to win, but we still have hope.</p>

<h3>A Scene from an Important Hong Kong Football Group A Match: South China Defeats Lincoln 1-0. Previously Lost 1-2, Now Wins 1-0. However, Although South China Wins, There are Still Many Thorns in Their Path to Hegemony. China Loses to Welsh 1-2.</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong News) In the previous match between the South China Group A football team and the Lincoln team, South China was defeated by a score of 1-2. Therefore, the championship issue was greatly affected. And yesterday, Sunday (the 7th), the two teams met again. Old enemies meeting are especially clear-eyed. As a result, South China won 1-0 in the last three minutes due to their better formation, washing away the shame of their previous defeat. On that day, the Caroline You Football Field attracted no less than several thousand Hong Kong and Chinese fans due to the prestige of the two teams. The grand occasion was rarely seen in the past. This shows the importance of this match's victory or defeat. On the South China side, Li Guowei was injured, and Tang Kun filled the vacancy. Huang Jiliang was unable to play due to matters, and Bao Jiaping filled the role of goalkeeper. The strength was not reduced compared to the original formation. The Lincoln team's members remained the same. Only the goalkeeper and two defenders were promoted from Group B, so the defense was inevitably weaker. Judging from the performances of the two teams on that day, South China was slightly better than Lincoln. Bao Jiaping and Li Tiansheng saved many dangerous balls. Tang Kun was the bravest, once blocking the enemy team's right forward from dribbling the ball close to the goal and shooting. The situation was extremely dangerous, but Tang blocked the ball with his body. His contribution was truly great. Forward Feng Jingxiang was monitored by the enemy's defender, so although he was very successful in the first half, he could not win due to a lack of support. The audience praised Ji Liang and Shui Yi's legs and Jiang Bai's head. Only Li Shuoyou, who had just arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai, lacked connection with the other players due to the initial collaboration, and his performance was slightly less brilliant. It is believed that Li will naturally become more proficient as he collaborates with the other players for a longer time. Lincoln's forwards were also extremely strong, comparable to South China. Although the goalkeeper was a latecomer, he was also quite competent. The main reason for their failure was the weakness of the defenders. Although South China won this time, there are still many thorns in the future. If they can move forward bravely and unstoppable, then this year's championship may be won again.</p>
<h3>South China Takes the Offensive First</h3>
<p>South China kicked off, and Lincoln center forward Higgins rushed forward to snatch the ball. South China's three center backs rushed forward to support and quickly passed it to Lincoln's territory, with great prestige, making Lincoln's defense see and lose heart. Lincoln's goalkeeper opened the goal kick, and the five forwards worked hard to attack. However, they failed to break through South China's defense line three times in a row. Even if they managed to advance to the territory, they would definitely be repelled by Li Tiansheng. Before long, Li Tiansheng got the ball. Lie Li rushed to snatch it, feeling quite successful. However, Bao Jiaping made a wonderful move, and Lie Li could do nothing. Bao passed the goal kick to the center, and Shui Yi galloped away. Liang Rongzhao saw the opportunity and passed it. Yang Shuiyi then had the opportunity to go one-on-one. Zheng Jiliang also accelerated and advanced. Lincoln could not support it and conceded a corner kick first. Shui Yi kicked it. The landing point was excellent. Tan Jiangxi was supposed to assist on the left, but at some point, he had sneaked to the right and charged up, sending the ball towards the goal. However, his strength was not enough, so it was saved by Dejin. Otherwise, South China would have been able to win a goal first and gain an advantage at this time.</p>
<h3>Still Unable to Fulfill His Wish</h3>
<p>South China was eager to win and besieged again, fighting fiercely in front of the Lincoln formation. Tan Jiangbai shot too hard, and the ball flew wildly away. Lincoln's siege began to be lifted. At that time, the South China troops were concentrated in the front and did not defend against Lie Li and He Jia's coordinated attack, causing South China to retreat step by step. Li Tiansheng witnessed the enemy troops on the road, as if entering an uninhabited territory, so he asked to come out again, cut off Lie and He's connection, and passed it to the front. Shui Yi made a wonderful pass, and the ball landed at the twelve-yard spot. Feng Jingxiang, Zheng Jiliang, and Tan Jiangbai swarmed in. The Lincoln formation was extremely dangerous. However, Lincoln was very lucky. Although the South China forwards fell and shot repeatedly, they were able to defend the last line of defense. The virgin membrane was not broken by South China.</p>
<h3>Suspected of Getting a Penalty Kick</h3>
<p>South China had not achieved results by advancing from the right for a long time, so they ordered Li Shiyou to be the main force for the advance, dribbling the ball forward, extremely agile. Therefore, South China poured out its troops again. Unfortunately, the first half had ended at this time. Although South China had its back to the sun in the second half, Lincoln used skirmishers to intercept South China's attacking troops and seize the opportunity to attack the goal. Although they could not win, they still made South China worry. After fifteen minutes, South China was able to develop slightly, but Dejin was able to safely save all the dangerous balls. At that time, South China advanced from the left more often, but Li Shiyou and Tan Jiangbai did not cooperate well, and their performance was not excellent. At 25 minutes, the two armies fought in a mixed battle at the twelve-yard spot in front of the Lincoln formation. You came and I went, in great chaos. The referee's whistle suddenly sounded. The audience thought that Lincoln must have been penalized with a twelve-yard free kick. While hesitating, Lincoln's Rowton quickly picked up the ball and kicked it out. The audience then knew that the Chinese team had been penalized.</p>
<h3>Shui Yi is Ambitious</h3>
<p>Then, Lincoln's right assistant, the burly MacKinney, had the ball passed to him, so he took a few steps forward and passed it to He Jia remotely. He Jia dribbled the ball, invaded the pass, and in an instant, the blond strongman had arrived in front of the formation. He Jia carefully crossed with his left foot. MacKinney was about to raise his foot and tap it, but Tang Kun's healthy feet arrived first and turned the danger into safety. Then, Yang Shuiyi was ambitious and got the ball and attacked the goal. The left center back, Bi Tuo, tried his best to defend, but Yang Shuiyi rushed past him. When he reached the last line of defense, he lost his hand and Imeson kicked the ball out. If Shuiyi could have advanced a few more yards, then Lincoln would have had no luck at this time. The entire South China team fought hard, but the results were almost zero. At this point, all the personnel of the team were very anxious. And because Li Shiyou was running for South China for the first time, the mysteries of which may not be clear, Tan Jiangbai could not fully develop his strengths. Fortunately, Jiang Bai's ambition to advance was never lazy, so he was able to win in the last two minutes.</p>
<h3>Jiang Bai Makes a Contribution with His Head</h3>
<p>The strongest defender on Lincoln's side that day</p>
<p>was definitely the center back, Queshi, who almost gave Feng Jingxiang no chance to shoot. Among the inside forwards, only Zheng Jiliang and Tan Jiangbai could move around slightly. At this time, South China ignored the consequences and abandoned the rear in order to win first. As expected, the opportunity to win the ball had arrived. Zheng Jiliang sent a ball, and Tan Jiangbai met it with his head. The onlookers were very clear-eyed and saw that the ball was already in the net and the enemy's goal had fallen. The onlookers applauded and stomped their feet, overjoyed. In the end, South China avenged themselves with a score of 1-0, washing away the shame of their previous defeat. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>

<h3>▲ Macklin Defeats Xiaguang</h3>
<p>Macklin has abundant talent, enough to form two teams. Since the beginning of the season, they have not encountered strong opponents. The match against Xiaguang was just a small test. Last night, they still used the rotation strategy, starting with their most elite players, and after establishing a lead, they were replaced by another group of players, taking turns to rest. Xiaguang, with a tired team, found it increasingly difficult to resist for a long time. The halftime score was 31-7. In the second half, Xiaguang was more active, with Zhang Renheng and Guo Binglin showing some aggression at one point, gaining some momentum. However, in the end, Macklin still won with a dominant score of 54-20.</p>

<h3>▲ Pirates Defeat Hujiang</h3>
<p>Pirates' center Lei Ying and Macklin's center Le Ke are both tall players in their respective teams. However, Lei's physique is not as good as Le's, and his movements are also slower. Lei and Kasheng scored the most points. Pilei was still light and swift, like a flying general. In contrast, Hujiang was full of little heroes. Feng Nianhua was agile, and Qian Jingyong's strange throws were often unexpected. His speed was especially praised by Chinese and foreign spectators. Although the Pirates launched a fierce attack as soon as they took the field, Hujiang was only behind by four or five points. Feng scored the most points. From 18-12, the Pirates suddenly increased their lead to 32-20, ending the first half. After the break, the game suddenly became even. Chen Weimin also broke through and scored two goals, and Qian and Feng also maintained their momentum. Soon after, the score was 44-29, and Hujiang entered a decline. The Pirates' momentum was rampant, and their iron cavalry moved horizontally. Although bystanders were moved by righteousness, they could not draw their swords to help, and could only sigh and hate.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Education Director Cheng Shih-kuei Announces This Year's Jiangxi Education Policy</h3>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondent) As the 23rd year begins, Cheng Shih-kuei, Director of the Jiangxi Education Department, has announced the education policy to inform colleagues in the province's education sector. He mentioned that he has formulated ten educational guidelines to address the national crisis education, provincial crisis education, production education, and character education. He elaborated on the following: (1) The main purpose of national crisis education is to transform the national mindset, stimulate the national spirit, and cultivate national self-confidence. (2) Provincial crisis education aims to train young people's thinking and strengthen the national physique, thereby increasing the people's self-defense capabilities. (3) Production education should promote scientific knowledge, vigorously improve rural areas, and increase local production. (4) Character education should pay attention to the integrity of the academic atmosphere, the rectification of the scholar's habits, and the improvement of folk customs. He concluded by saying that this period is the time for educators to take responsibility. Educators' sole belief lies in consistently believing in the effectiveness of education. What is said above, national crisis education is for saving the country, provincial crisis education is for saving the province, production education is for teaching people, and character education is for saving the nation. These are all the goals and applications of education in the future, and none of them are not the responsibilities of educators. Those who can exert their best efforts will surely find spiritual comfort, and those who have the determination to act vigorously will surely reap practical results. This is also the general principle of service. I, Shih-kuei, would like to inform my colleagues and encourage them to work together and see the results.</p>

<h3>Banning Textbooks and Teaching Materials That Cause National Resentment</h3>
<p>▲ All Ethnic Groups are Equal, Without Discrimination</p>
<p>▲ The Municipal Education Bureau is Ordered to Notify</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an instruction to schools and magazines in the city, stating: "According to Instruction No. 13967 from the Ministry of Education, the Xinjiang Education Commissioner Huang Wenbi reported that a Mongolian named Bao Yue-gui claimed that some textbooks contained records of Han people killing Mongolians on commemorative days. After investigation, it was found that the elementary school textbooks published around 1926 contained the fact that the Mid-Autumn Festival was a commemorative day for killing Tatars, which caused dissatisfaction among the Mongolian people. Please take measures to ban such or similar records and remarks to avoid causing resentment among ethnic groups." Based on this, the Party advocates that all ethnic groups within the country are equal and without discrimination. Therefore, the Bureau is ordered to strictly ban textbooks containing such records and instruct all schools, bookstores, and magazines to be especially careful when compiling textbooks or citing stories, so as not to include anything that could cause resentment among ethnic groups within the country, in order to uphold the government's consistent intention of harmonizing the feelings of all ethnic groups. This instruction is hereby issued for compliance.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Ren Wei</p>
<p>In my childhood, I remember a passage in my elementary school textbook: "The limbs complained that the mouth only knew how to eat and did not work. The mouth complained that the stomach only knew how to digest food. The stomach complained that the large intestine only absorbed nutrients and did not digest food. As a result, the limbs went on strike, the mouth had no food to eat, the stomach had no food to digest, and the large intestine had no nutrients to absorb. Finally, the limbs could not get the supply of nutrients and could not move." Children! Here is a very appropriate analogy: the limbs are like laborers, the mouth and stomach are like the petty bourgeoisie, and the large intestine is like the big capitalists. There should be no class divisions in society. However, laborers cannot be separated from the petty bourgeoisie; the petty bourgeoisie cannot be separated from the big capitalists; and the big capitalists cannot be separated from the laborers. The relationship between these three is just like the human body, no one can complain about anyone, and no one can be separated from anyone. Unfortunately, each class in society only knows its own selfish interests and lacks the spirit of cooperation. As a result, they will all perish together and run to a path of destruction!</p>
<p>Children! When you grow up, whether you are laborers, petty bourgeoisie, or big capitalists, you must not conflict or fight each other, so that they cannot stand each other. You should take the spirit of cooperation and run together to the bright road!</p>
<h3>The Unhygienic Wang Anshi</h3>
<p>— Yuan Xifu</p>
<p>Wang Anshi was the Prime Minister of the Song Dynasty. He was very knowledgeable in politics and literature. He once changed the politics of the Song Dynasty, and many of his writings have been passed down. However, he was a person who never paid attention to hygiene.</p>
<p>He does not comb his hair; does not take a bath; and does not change his clothes.</p>
<p>One day, a louse crawled on his beard. His friend said to him, "There is a louse on your beard!" Anshi said in a pedantic manner, "It is occasionally swimming on the Prime Minister's beard, and the Emperor has seen it!"</p>
<p>After speaking, he laughed.</p>
<p>Little Experience</p>
<p>— Jianfen</p>
<h3>Calligraphy Practice</h3>
<p>Little friends: Are your calligraphy practice books divided into nine squares? When you first started learning calligraphy, did you feel that your copies didn't look like the originals? Now, I'll tell you a very simple method: (1) First, use a piece of glass the same size as the characters on the model; (2) Draw the nine-square grid on the glass with ink; (3) When copying, place the glass with the nine-square grid over the characters on the model; (4) Copy the characters that are projected through the glass onto your nine-square grid practice book, following the grid lines. This way, the copied characters, although not exactly like the originals, will be better than copying without any guidelines.</p>
<p>(Supplementary Note) Little friends: If your practice book is a blank paper book, just use a piece of white paper the same size as the book, draw a nine-square grid on it, and place it under the paper you're using to copy. Then the white paper will also project a nine-square grid.</p>
<h3>Steel Pen Nib</h3>
<p>When you use a new steel pen (not a fountain pen) or a new steel pen nib, often the nib is dipped in ink, but it doesn't write: (sometimes it might write, but rarely). What is the reason for this? It's probably because the nib is coated with oil from the "pen nib manufacturing machine"...: so it can't write. At this time, you just need to wipe the nib with a piece of paper; it's best to first light a match and burn the nib, then wipe it with paper. This way, the nib will write smoothly.</p>
<h3>Little Ant</h3>

<h3>Big Snow Flurries</h3>

<p>Children's Court of Hankou Municipal Primary School</p>
<p>— Zhao Peng</p>
<p>Hankou Municipal First Primary School has very complete facilities. In addition to having a kindergarten, Minsheng Bank, a vending department, and a model village, the school has also established a children's court. The purpose is to cultivate children's legal knowledge and enhance their ability to self-govern. Although the organization is simple, the scale is quite complete, and the work within the court is well-organized. Now, I will introduce the contents of the court below, hoping that the primary school students in this city will try it out.</p>
<h3>Female Student Serves as Director</h3>
<p>The organization of the court is very simple, consisting of one director, two judges, two clerks, and two bailiffs, all serving in voluntary positions. There are no transportation fees or office expenses, and all positions are held by students.</p>
<h3>All Kinds of Naughty Cases</h3>
<p>The students of the school are mostly around seven or eight to eleven or twelve years old. Of course, there are inevitably naughty behaviors among the students. Therefore, the cases handled by the court are nothing more than the following: (1) Not returning borrowed books, (2) Not repaying borrowed money, (3) Cursing others, (4) Hitting people for no reason, (5) Snatching food, (6) Writing words with chalk or drawing turtles on others' bodies, (7) Soiling others' clothes, (8) Fighting, (9) Stealing things.</p>
<h3>Interrogation Resembles a Court</h3>
<p>After the court accepts a case, it schedules a hearing. Both the plaintiff and the defendant must appear in court to present their cases. Sixth-grade students can act as lawyers, representing and defending the parties involved. After the director understands the details of the case, they will judge the severity of the circumstances and issue a verdict, including: recording demerits, compensation, standing as punishment, and apology. If someone makes a false accusation, they will be punished in return.</p>
<h3>Training Office as the Supreme Court</h3>
<p>If the judgment of a case is unfair or biased, the losing party can appeal to the director of training (i.e., the Supreme Court), and the case will be tried again. After the judgment, it becomes final.</p>
<h3>The Wonder of Water</h3>
<p>— Xu Zongjie</p>
<p>What we drink and use daily is also something indispensable in life, and that is water. We are so used to it that we don't find it wonderful at all. But upon close examination, we find that nothing in the world is more wonderful than it.</p>
<p>It is a flowing "liquid." Exposed to sunlight, it evaporates and rises, turning into a "gas." When it encounters cold, it freezes into ice, as clear as crystal and as hard as stone, which is a "solid." Is there anything else besides water that can exist in three states: "liquid," "gas," and "solid"?</p>
<p>This is not the only wonderful thing about it. When it evaporates and rises, it turns into raindrops when it encounters cold. When raindrops fall and encounter cold, they turn into six-petaled snowflakes or hailstones the size of soybeans. Water vapor near the ground turns into dew at night; if it gets colder, it turns into frost. In fact, rain, dew, frost, and snow are all magic tricks of water.</p>
<p>Its nature is incomparably calm. It flows downward when tilted. Therefore, scientists use it as a standard for flatness, and call it a "horizontal line."</p>
<p>Water is truly a wonderful thing. Little friends, if you don't believe me, you might as well take a closer look.</p>
<h3>Quickly Cut Your Nails</h3>
<p>— Ning Ziqiang</p>
<p>Little friends! Do you have nails on your hands? Please cut them clean from today onwards! Why? Nails are a medium for transmitting diseases and a silent killer. How can nails kill? Because when you play with dirty things with your hands, and then grab food and eat voraciously, the disease-causing agents enter your stomach without you even realizing it.</p>
<p>If you eat unclean food, won't you get sick! Cholera! Plague! Diphtheria! Dysentery! If the illness is severe, it can kill, so isn't that a silent killer?</p>
<p>Little friends! Not only should you cut your nails, but you should also wash your hands frequently. Not washing your hands before eating is a way to prevent illness!</p>
<h3>Three Arrivals</h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>Little friends! Let me tell you a story!</p>
<p>A person went to a friend's house, and they were scheduled to meet at nine o'clock. He was walking hurriedly when he suddenly heard someone shouting, "Nine o'clock has arrived, nine o'clock has arrived." He was very anxious, fearing he would be late, so he asked the person shouting;</p>
<p>"How is it already nine o'clock?"</p>
<p>The person shouting laughed and said, "You're mistaken. I'm shouting "The tavern has arrived." You misheard it as "nine o'clock has arrived.""</p>
<p>Little friends, we must have our eyes, hands, and hearts on the job when we do things. Three arrivals!</p>
<h3>Little Mouse Leaves the Hole</h3>
<p>— Yan BOGuang</p>
<p>A little mouse said to its mother in the hole: "Mother! I'm going out to play today! Play!"</p>
<p>Its mother said: "When you go outside, never be greedy! Beware of people using delicious things to lure you."</p>
<p>The little mouse quickly replied: "I know!"</p>
<p>As soon as it left the hole, it felt extremely interesting. There were so many fascinating things to see. Suddenly, it saw a beautiful wire cage with a fragrant cake inside. It forgot what its mother had told it and squeezed its body into the cage. Before it had finished eating, it had already locked itself inside. But its mother was still deeply hoping that her son, why doesn't he come back sooner.</p>
<h3>Correspondence from Little Rural Friends</h3>
<p>— Zi Ming</p>
<p>Withering Wood</p>
<p>Dear little friends:</p>
<p>When the tomb of autumn is completed, the god of winter, baring his fangs and brandishing his iron axe, strikes a menacing pose to start a fire with the world. The lush, vibrant deep forest changes, changes because of him, turning red and yellow. In the end, the branches and leaves fall, leaving only desolation! The wind howls. Fortunately, one or two little birds come to pay their respects, but they are shot by hunters unexpectedly with a "bang," becoming pitiful creatures to be mourned!</p>
<p>I remember an incident three years ago, roughly like this: twenty or thirty soldiers, armed with guns and bayonets, and shouting madly with foreign horns "dida, dida": behind the soldiers were many men, women, old, and young civilians following. I looked closely: everyone surrounded a bare-chested man with his hands tied behind his back: at one point, the bound man knelt down, he just knelt down, and someone jumped out from behind, holding a shiny knife, only vaguely hearing a "stab," the head was a movable watermelon. In that instant, applause and shouts of "kill" sounded like thunder, but the atmosphere of "terror and killing" remained. Those who watched were horrified, as if staying long would lead to the misery of being killed, and they scattered in a puff of smoke: no, there was still a corpse with its hands tied behind its back and no head!</p>
<p>Little friends: Are you sad for this headless man?</p>
<p>You must know that the trees that have shed their branches and leaves are no different under the tyranny of winter.</p>
<p>Withered Grass</p>
<p>Dear little friends:</p>
<p>This world, the world that you and I live in, is constantly changing, moment by moment, moment by moment. Human affairs are like this, and so is nature. Autumn dies and winter is born, the changes in nature are just particularly obvious.</p>
<p>Those trees have been taken to the execution ground; but where have those flowers and grasses gone, which world have they gone to? The fragrant and beautiful flowers once attracted many people's admiration and appreciation: the short grass was like needles, and the green turf was evenly laid out; I remember that not long ago, our truly lively little friends slept, jumped, and danced here. Now the green world is gone. Terrible, this "changing" world!</p>
<p>Several little friends in tattered clothes are carrying a bundle of withered grass. These little friends are probably the children of boatmen from Jiangbei; they may be entrusted by God to specially "collect corpses" for the withered grass everywhere, resulting in "cremation"!</p>
<p>But, there are many flowers and plants that are thriving in the flower room, basking in the sun and heating the water: they sprout, grow, bud, and bloom; but they have never known the taste of "winter". Nor do they know the misery of the other flowers and plants.</p>
<p>Plants also have good fortune and misfortune, strange?</p>
<p>When this letter meets you, it will probably be at the beginning of the year in the Republic of China, so here I wish you</p>
<p>A happy New Year and progress</p>

<h3>New Year</h3>
<p>— Han Xiaoxia, a sixth-grade student from Hua Nan Primary School</p>
<p>The New Year is coming, and soon it will bring the bright spring light from the ends of the earth, bestowing it upon us lively and innocent little friends. What a happy thing this is!</p>
<p>But, every time I come home from school, I always see my dear parents sitting face to face with sad faces, or talking and sighing about economic problems of "owing others" and "being owed"... these are also things that make me feel disappointed in addition to happiness.</p>
<p>Last night, my mother sat on the bed and, out of nowhere, told me a story about the New Year. She said: "Nian" is a man-eating beast that appears once every three hundred and sixty days or so. Its purpose is to eat people; so on New Year's Day, people close their doors and stay at home to avoid "Nian". On the second day, everyone goes out to stroll around, and when they meet acquaintances, they greet each other with "Congratulations"... "Closing the door" is to prevent "Nian", and "Congratulations" is to congratulate you for escaping the poisonous mouth of "Nian" and not being eaten by "Nian."</p>
<p>Even now, I still remember it, I remember it very clearly, and I even seem a little scared.</p>
<p>However, when I think of the bright spring light, the new clothes that my mother is sewing for me, and the pastries that my father bought back from the city yesterday, I can't help but dance for joy again.</p>
<h3>A Child's Failure</h3>
<p>— Ju Chengchang, a thirteen-year-old student from Songjiang</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a child playing in the garden, walking back and forth, when suddenly, he saw a sparrow falling on the ground, crying wildly. The child picked up the sparrow with his little hands and looked at it, seeing that one of its legs was broken. The child took some cloth to bandage the broken leg and put it on a tree. After a while, the sparrow flew away.</p>
<p>Later, the sparrow brought a seed and dropped it in the child's garden. After a few days, that seed turned into a watermelon. The child saw this watermelon, and quickly happily picked it, cut it open with a knife, and inside there were big and small pearls and treasures. The child took the pearls to his mother, and his mother was very happy, and the child was also very happy. A child next door heard about it, so he caught a sparrow, broke one of its legs, bandaged it with cloth, and let the sparrow fly away. After a few days, that sparrow also brought a seed and dropped it in his garden. After a few more days, a watermelon also grew. The child was very happy, and he said, "I will also have big pearls..." So he picked it, cut it open with a knife, and a ball of fire came out of the watermelon and burned the child to death.</p>

<h3>Market Weak in the Morning, Brisk in the Afternoon; Gold Market Result Still Good at Eight Corners</h3>
<p>Gold Exchange Spring Festival Holiday Changed to Five Days</p>
<p>Swap Premium Expected to Be Around Twelve Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market was weak in the morning yesterday, but eventually major players, including swap-related accounts and the speculator Mr. Wu, bought aggressively, resulting in a higher closing price than the previous day. The market situation was weak but recovered, and people's sentiment followed suit. In the early morning, overseas silver markets rose in both the UK and the US, with forward silver prices rising by 6.5 to 7.4 points. Exchange rates did not fluctuate much. London spot gold rose by one penny. The US official gold buying price remained unchanged. US cotton fell by 7 pounds. US wheat rose by 1.375 points. Stocks fell by 6.5 corners. The wool market opened and immediately fell to 81 yuan, but then rose due to the efforts of Hui Xiang and others to cover short positions. After the opening, the situation was calm, with no unexpected changes. The price fluctuated relatively steadily. Subsequently, due to a sudden hardening of the domestic market and unfavorable rumors from foreign news agencies about continued purchases of gold and silver by the US, the price fell. However, bank appetite remained strong, and the domestic market trended tighter again. Foreign news agencies reported that the US president had not yet made any statement on gold. Major players in the market, such as Hongli, Qingfa, Yongda, Xingyong, etc., purchased extremely aggressively, and the gold price rebounded sharply. The current swap will officially begin at 3 pm next Monday, with the expected premium being around 12 yuan (buyers paying the premium). The Gold Exchange will be closed for five days from February 14th to 18th due to the reconstruction of the market. The original telephone rooms will be temporarily operating in the brokers' rooms in the back. Also, because money changers will be closed for five days at the beginning of the lunar new year, there will be no market for remittances. Therefore, the Spring Festival holiday has been changed to five days, as already announced. The market situation for the half-day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 684.5 yuan, down 3.1 yuan from the previous closing. Physicals were bid at 4.3 yuan. The exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price for British exchange at 1 shilling 4 pence 125, and US exchange at 34.5 yuan. Yuanchun Hengyu sold at 3.8 yuan, but Hengxing Hongli Yuanmao Yong, etc., came in, raising it to 5.5 yuan. Pan Gen offered to sell April US dollars at 35.1875, and Hengtai Fuyu Hengxing sold, lowering it to 4.3 yuan. Zhengjin bid for May US dollars at 375 and 4375. Yuanmao Yong Qingfa Yongjin offered, rising to 5.7 yuan. It was rumored that HSBC quoted British up 125 and US up 375. It once retreated to within 4 yuan, but because Hengyu Bingxing took advantage of the low price to buy, it rose back to 5 yuan. After entering, the market formed a downstream trend due to Yida Yong's disposal and banks offering near-term US dollars. The domestic market hardened once, and May US dollars at half a yuan suddenly became difficult to sell. Guangdong banks sold, lowering it to 3.1 yuan. HSBC bought May US dollars at 5625. Daxing Yongjin offered, and the price rose again. Then, Huabi bid for the same month at half a yuan, and Mitsui bought again at 4375. Daxing Yong Zhifeng Yong Hongli Richang etc. offered to over 6 yuan. Hengyu took advantage of the high price to offer, dropping one yuan. However, market sentiment suddenly strengthened, and major players aggressively covered short positions. The domestic market remained good. Macaulay and Mitsui bid for May US dollars at 375. Fuyu Qingfa Yong Heng Xingyuan etc. offered to 8.3 yuan, but Shenkang limited the board to sell, and Bingxing Daxing Yong Wanxing also supplied, struggling around the 8 yuan mark. Finally, Daxing Yong Yifang Yong Yuan Sheng Yong bought aggressively, and the afternoon closing rose to 688.4 yuan. Physicals were bid at 8.5 yuan. It was initially flat after the closing, but then retreated to 7.5 yuan due to the supply from Yuanmao Yong Qingfa Yong. The highest price for the half-day was 688.4 yuan, and the lowest price was 683.1 yuan, with a fluctuation of 5.3 yuan. The result was a slight increase of 8 corners compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The announced price was 33.875 yuan for the US exchange quoted by HSBC Bank at a premium of 375, which corresponds to a standard gold price of over 708 yuan. Based on the closing price, it is about 10 yuan, which is about 9 yuan weaker than the previous closing. The registration price for this month is 697 yuan, and for February it is 688 yuan. The morning margin call was 697 yuan. The open red price was 1056 yuan. Transactions in the market were slightly sparse. Only Tianjin banks sold to Taikang Run, etc., for a total of about 1,000 taels at 1055 yuan, which were for three-week delivery. Those for one-week delivery were about 1057 yuan. The current swap (February to March) will begin at 3 pm on Monday next week, but brokers</p>
<p>have already pre-arranged a premium of 11 yuan for long positions. However, it seems that those willing to pay this premium are eager to do so. There are still 1,841 taels of this month's tickets remaining.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was flat, and short covering was extremely aggressive. In summary, Huixiang Daxing Yong Qingfa Yong Zhifeng Yong Hengchang Yong Hongli Yifeng Yong Yongde Yong Feng Zhaofeng Chang Yuan Chun Futai Heng Richang Yuan Sheng Yong Heng Xingyuan etc. were on the buying side. Wanxing Shunli Bingxing Shenkang Yuanmao Dafayong Xianghe Qian Changxiang Dadecheng Yuanmao Yong etc. were on the selling side. Hengxing Yuanmao Yong advanced first and then retreated. Yida Yong Hengyu retreated first and then advanced. Dalian banks and Wanxing did a total of over 2,000, netting out over 1,000 tickets. Shunli did a total of over 1,000, netting out less than 200. Guangdong banks Hengxing advanced over 100 tickets and retreated over 400 tickets. As of today, the total number of February chips is 37,975 tickets.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the total number of long and short positions for February was as follows: long positions included Fuchang with over 4,900 tickets, Hongxing Wanxing Yifeng Yong etc. with over 3,000 each, Yuanheng with over 2,700, Qian Changxiang with over 2,600, Yuan Sheng Yong with over 2,100, Fuyu with over 2,400, Yiyu with over 2,000, Zhaofengchang with over 1,700, Shunli Run Changyu with over 1,400 each, Yuan Changyong with over 1,300, Yongfeng with over 900 tickets, and Hongxing Yong with over 700 tickets.

<h3>Exchange Market Quietly Flat</h3>
<p>According to foreign news agencies yesterday, London long-term bills rose by 125, with near-term bills at 19 pence 4375 and long-term bills at 19 pence and a half. The British-American exchange rate opened at 5.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Interbank Loan Market Remains Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the interbank loan market remained unchanged in both the morning and afternoon, calculated at 6 points. The overall situation was weak, and transfers remained white without additional liquidity. The transaction volume of loan bills was over 4.6 million in the morning and over 300,000 in the afternoon. Transactions in the small clearinghouse were 500,000. Due to it being Saturday, the situation for bank settlements was generally weak. Foreign banks settled over 1.1 million in ticket funds, 1.67 million in foreign currency, over 2.78 million in various commodity exchange collateral, and 3.45 million in foreign currency. Special fund settlements were over 1.5 million, outgoing silver was 200,000, and foreign currency was 400,000. Chinese banks settled over 2.5 million in ticket funds, over 1.9 million in special funds, over 4 million in various commodity exchange tax and miscellaneous funds, and outgoing 400,000.

<h3>Jiangjiao Fluctuations Are Huge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small silver dollar was still strong in the morning, calculated at 841 yuan. In the afternoon, it suddenly fell by 6 yuan, calculated at 835 yuan.

The transaction volume was over 36,000 strings, calculated at a price of 12,200 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Wavering All Day, Bond Prices Rose Little and Fell More</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to the Min Army's resistance, the Japanese residents not retreating, and the Central Government's offensive, there were still concerns. The resolution of the Fuzhou situation still seemed to be postponed. With the Fourth Plenary Session about to convene, many people still harbored doubts about whether there would be other changes. Moreover, market prices were already at a peak. Sellers believed there was no great danger, especially with a large volume of sales at No. 46. Therefore, market sentiment gradually weakened. At the opening in the morning, supply from various trading groups exceeded demand, with limited activity from large investors. Market prices uniformly continued to decline by two to three dimes to five or six dimes, with no sign of a sharp fall. In the second session, there were still many sellers, mostly continuing to decline by one or two dimes to half a dollar. Among them, the Disbandment and Gold Short, however, improved by one or two dimes. At the opening in the afternoon, the previous declines continued, but gradually stabilized. Various securities in the latter group rebounded slightly by two or three dimes, still unable to break free from the fluctuating trend. News at the closing was better. Suddenly, there were large-scale purchases of No. 20, buying up items one by one. Market prices gradually became firmer. The upward trend was stronger later, with many rebounding by six or seven dimes. Initially, the trend turned weak due to the surge of sales at No. 46, but then turned firm due to the large-scale purchases of No. 20. The forecast for the future is that it will still be a fluctuating upward trend. Market prices ultimately rose little and fell more, mostly falling by one or two dimes to five or six dimes. Only the New Customs Tax rose by one dollar, with a few slightly better by one or two dimes. The total volume of transactions was 15,925,000 yuan. There were no spot transactions. Futures included 5,250,000 yuan for Unified Salt Tax, 2,545,000 yuan for Yuan Disbandment, 1,260,000 yuan for 19 Customs Bonds, 3,245,000 yuan for 20 Customs Bonds, and 2,185,000 yuan for Gold Short Regular Six. The rest ranged from 100,000 to over 600,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Shows Slight Discrepancies</h3>
<p>A New Fungkong Trading Company report on the 12th stated that the New York stock market was initially slightly weak, but then rebounded strongly due to good commercial news and strong bond performance. U.S. government bonds surged by one dollar, with strong buying from banks, insurance companies, the government, and private investors. Looking at the overall stock market situation, it may still be inconsistent for the time being. The total daily transaction volume was 1.6 million shares. (Wheat) The public generally believed that the government's monetary policy would be announced next week, leading to substantial purchases and price increases. The situation still favors bullish sentiment. (Cotton) Initially, the opening was firm, but later there were fears that the government would continue to release cotton, and reports on the success or failure of legislation to restrict cotton ginning were contradictory. Bulls tended to liquidate, and the market was depressed. Buyers were still waiting for a rebound. The Foreign Financial Reconstruction Association bought gold at a price of $34.06 per ounce, unchanged. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price　　　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks　98.37　Down 0.65</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks　41.71　Down 0.30</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks　24.33　Down 0.50</p>
<p>40 Bonds　　　　86.45　Up 0.38</p>
<p>11 Commodities　　49.90　Up 0.23</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Continues to Show Weakness</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to fall, with a rather weak trend. Real demand turned sluggish, and there were unfavorable news regarding current events. As a result, market sentiment was particularly weak. At the same time, British factories offered 4,000 bales of 20-count yarn. Those who accepted it sold it on the market, making the market even looser. However, the cotton market was firm and rising, leaving factories in dire straits.</p>
<h3>Man Standard Yarn Continues to Fall by About One Yuan</h3>
<p>The Man Standard yarn market opened with a particularly weak market situation. There were fewer buyers. Prices for all months fell by 9 dimes to one yuan. In the afternoon, it was reported that there were few spot yarn transactions, and the market remained weak, falling by 1.2 dimes. The total daily transaction volume was estimated at 14,500 bales. Sales included 1,000 bales of Yu Kang, 1,000 bales of Da Feng, 600 bales of Da Liu, 650 bales of Xie Sheng, and 500 bales of Shen Ji. Purchases included 400 bales of Yuan Tai, 450 bales of Yuan De, 400 bales of De Ji, 650 bales of Tong He, 750 bales of Geng Feng, 450 bales of Ji Feng, and 350 bales of Ren Feng.

<h3>Yarn Sales Continue to Shrink</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales were less than the previous day. Statistics for all trading groups for the entire day show purchases of only 390 bales. Market conditions weakened. Jardine Matheson offered 4,000 bales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd (asking price of 182.5 yuan), sold out for the January and February periods. Purchases by various trading groups were as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong　105　Shantou　45　Southeast Asia　100</p>
<p>Inland　128　Ningbo　　2　Colleagues　　10</p>
<p>The cotton market showed slight signs of softening, with American cotton falling, exchange rates lengthening, and the rising trend of Indian cotton stabilized, with talk of a reaction and decline. Therefore, market sentiment was slightly calmer. Bullish Ningbo traders also realized profits and liquidated 20,000 to 30,000 dan. With this stock being released into the market, the market loosened. However, bullish Shanghai traders tightened their grip and did not release it. The future depends on Indian cotton.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Cotton Drops Another Two or Three Dimes</h3>
<p>The Zheng Standard cotton market opened with bullish Ningbo traders releasing cotton, prices for all months falling by two, three, or four dimes. In the afternoon, market sentiment tightened slightly, with near-month contracts rising by five points and far-month contracts unchanged. The total daily transaction volume was estimated at 100,410 dan. Sales included 4,600 dan of Da Feng, 2,700 dan of Chun Ji, 2,000 dan of Sui Long, 6,700 dan of Chang Feng, 7,300 dan of Yuan Xing Chang, 5,500 dan of Heng De, 1,600 dan of Ren Feng, and 2,900 dan of Yi Cheng.

<h3>Factories Have No Intention of Purchasing Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>The need for spot cotton has turned sluggish. Factories, with no way to sell yarn, are dull in purchasing raw materials. The source of supply included 290 bales of Yao cotton and 1,976 bales of Tong cotton. Spot cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 39.75 Da Feng Factory Purchased 500 pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>

<h3>American Cotton Has Fallen Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market conditions were inconsistent, with a possibility of a reaction. Initially, prices rose due to spot traders buying, but later fell due to unfavorable news from Liverpool. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by 10 to 12 points. Liverpool spot cotton was unchanged, and futures fell by 5 or 6 points. Egyptian spot cotton was unchanged. Mumbai cotton cloth fell due to bull liquidation and Japanese sales. As a result, Pinggar rose by 7.5 points, Aumra fell by 7.5 points, and Bairoxi rose by 1 rupee and 2.5 points. The original telegraph record is on the left (12th telegram):</p>

<h3>American Cotton Fields Tend to Decrease</h3>
<p>A New York telegram on the 12th reported on the cotton market for the week: Last week, the cotton market improved due to increased demand from the industry and speculators. Trading was also active, and the spot position was strong. There is a tendency for a decrease in cotton fields next season, with an upward trend. Bulls have liquidated their positions, and government agents have also occasionally sold cotton to protect their contract privileges. Since the end of last year, prices have risen by about 7.5 points, and bulls have also sold off accordingly. It is reported that farmers are signing up to reduce planting quite quickly. Washington news: The government is planning to increase its power to manage and reduce production. The weekend statistics are attached on the left (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>

<h3>Sales of Japanese Factory Yarn Decreased Significantly in December</h3>
<p>According to a survey by Japanese trading companies in Shanghai, the total sales of cotton yarn transported from Japanese factories in Shanghai to various places in December 1933 was 27,144 bales, a decrease of 13,128 bales compared to the end of November. The reason for the decrease in exports is said to be the changes in the Fujian situation, which affected various places. The destinations and bale amounts are listed below:</p>

<h3>The Standard Flour Market Is Quite Dull</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for various months showed a trend of initial firmness followed by weakness. With foreign wheat quoted at about two or three dimes higher in Chicago and four or five dimes higher in Canada, the opening price was slightly better than the previous day by half a point. However, trading in each session was exceptionally quiet. Real sales groups had no interest, so market sentiment weakened again. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading in various months was still sluggish. However, factories had different attitudes. With real sales being so sluggish, they naturally could not stubbornly resist. But another part was still holding on. As a result, the current month was unchanged, February was up by 0.5%, March was up by 0.25%, April was unchanged, May was up by 0.5%, and June was up by 1%.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Are Calm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, generally showed a fluctuating trend for various months. With foreign wheat quoted two, three, four, or five dimes higher, market sentiment was inevitably slightly better. However, with the end of the accounting period approaching, trading companies were doing little trading. Therefore, only the June contract opened at one price in the morning, and the rest were vacant bids. There was slight trading in the afternoon, but there were few movements. As a result, the current month was unchanged, February and April were up by one point, June was unchanged, and the rest were unopened. The spot wheat market, due to scarce arrivals, was gradually bid up. It was reported that over 1,000 bags of Shandong white wheat were opened at a price of 4.05 yuan, purchased by Shen Da.</p>
<h3>Measures for Selling American Flour and Wheat</h3>
<p>It is heard that the government has had several discussions with people in the flour industry regarding the measures for selling American flour and wheat borrowed by the government, and there are already measures in place. There are approximately 160,000 tons of wheat and 6.4 million bags of flour. Starting next month, they will be shipped to China in batches over a year, so that the effect of adjustment can still be achieved during sales.</p>
<h3>Late Rice Sales Stagnant, Slightly Softer by Two Points</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Sources of supply from various trading groups are still surging, with over 70 vessels arriving continuously (over 10,000 shi). Among them, there are still over 30 ships of late rice, and the guest trading groups' appetite suddenly became stagnant after the market was smoothly handled once yesterday. Unexpectedly, this caused it to turn sluggish. There is currently a state of invisible stagnation. Therefore, market conditions initially seemed to contain a sign of weakness, and sellers were unwilling to easily release them, resulting in a quiet environment. Later, fortunately, those in the trade went to the warehouse to handle it, and about 1,000 bags of green corner, Song, Si, Feng, and Lian goods were sold, and prices slightly improved by two points. The appetite for thick japonica and Du Yang tip rice from various trading groups was slightly more active, and the market also seemed to turn slightly. The overall trend for Chang, Su, Tong, and Nangang goods was able to stabilize slightly, but still contained a soft color. Yin Yuan remains firm due to seasonal influences.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over 20 vessels arrived from various places downriver. Sales of various types on the market are still sluggish and detailed. The market is trending downward daily. White japonica, white yuan, early thin rice, and yin yuan prices are slightly lower by a small margin. Yang Du, Bu Ke, and tip rice are also down by a small number of points.</p>
<h3>Guest Indica High-Quality Goods Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's guest indica market was initially flat and weak, but then there were inquiries from local rice shops. Also, the situation in Fujian Province gradually stabilized, and market sentiment gradually improved. There was an intention to buy and store from various parties. Therefore, the market seemed to be able to gradually turn around. However, there were not many high-quality goods on the market, with medium-quality goods being more abundant. Therefore, high-quality goods were able to hold their ground, while medium-quality goods were still being watched for weakness. Yesterday, a Ningbo trading group purchased 100 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice at a price of 6.55 yuan. Local and account traders purchased 43 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled red rice at a price of 6.54 yuan, 93 bags of Hunan machine-milled red rice at a price of 6.54 yuan, and 560 bags of Jingtian rice at a price of 5.85 yuan to 5.80 yuan. Other transactions were minimal.</p>
<h3>Soybean Prices Turn Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean prices continued to rise by two or three points, actually because sellers' intention to sell turned tight. The source of supply was not surging, the sales channel continued, and market sentiment was firm. Moreover, market prices had fallen to the bottom, causing both buyers and sellers to unanimously view it as good. The atmosphere was very tight. It is hoped that incoming goods will connect but not surge, and sales channels will continue without interruption. The market may see an upward trend in the future. Yesterday, about 11 or 12 carloads of various beans were traded in total. Zhengyangguan beans opened at 3.50 yuan to 4.00 yuan, Xuzhou beans at 3.43 yuan, Huangkou beans at 3.35 yuan, Guidé beans at 3.45 yuan to 3.33 yuan, and Xinyangzhou beans at 3.32 yuan to 3.30 yuan. Dalian beans opened at two carloads, priced at 4.35 yuan, purchased by local traders. 200 bags of Pinghu Du beans opened at prices of 4.90 yuan and 4.77 yuan, which were divided between Ningbo and local traders.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Chaoqing Falls Sharply, Minor Rebound</h3>
<p>Shantou Telegram Reports Another Rise of Three Dimes</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was slow, as it was Saturday and there were no loadings today. The trend was still weak. However, Chaoqing, according to telegrams from Shantou, continued to rise by three dimes, and the quoted prices turned tight. The association quoted a price of 18.95 yuan for No. 24 raw sugar, but there were no takers. Dutch Red Taikoo sugar also quoted the original price, but no transactions were made. The local factory's refined white sugar fell another dime. Zhen Ji No. 1 was 17.9 yuan, No. 2 was 7 dimes, No. 3 was 5 dimes, and No. 4 was 3 dimes. Chaoqing, after the first session of picking up village green came to 15.5 yuan, has fallen by more than 3 yuan step by step. Now, with land prices rising by 5 dimes over the past two days, the quoted prices have shown a slight rebound, opening at about 400 bags, priced at 12 yuan, and 11.9 yuan to 11.6 yuan, up by a corner. There is a continued tightening trend, which can be said to be a sharp fall followed by a minor rebound. New cotton red opened at about a hundred bags, priced at 15 yuan to 14.7 yuan. Diaoqing also brought slightly better news. It was already open yesterday.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<h3>Association Iron Arrives, Sales Are Strong, but Sluggish</h3>
<p>The Association Iron market, recently, due to the slack business of guest trading groups and the lack of procurement by local can factories, cigarette factories, and biscuit companies, the trend is extremely cold. Therefore, the quoted price level is very weak. The price per box, such as old steel factory goods, is estimated at 29.5 yuan, and new steel factory goods open at 28.25 yuan, both looser than before. However, imports are currently very strong, so there are a large number of them stockpiled in various foreign warehouses in Pudong and Puxi. Therefore, the future trend is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<h3>Purple Copper Yesterday's Telegram Falls by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Purple copper received a weak telegram from New York yesterday, so the local market atmosphere was depressed. The standard price fell by one yuan, and the selling price was 44.5 yuan per dan. Only about a hundred dan were traded.</p>
<h3>Bamboo Steel Bar Prices Gradually Loosen</h3>
<p>Bamboo steel bars were sold yesterday for only 108 yuan, another 2 yuan looser than before. Transactions with construction groups were still good, but procurement by guest trading groups was already scarce. However, arrivals within the year were extremely strong, the market was empty, and the price level was difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3>As New Year's Candles Are About to Be Sold, Asphalt Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the new asphalt market in Hankou, due to the need for procurement in various places, with thousands of dan being processed in Zhenjiang, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Ningbo, and even procurement in Yichang, the source of supply has turned scarce at this time, resulting in supply not meeting demand. At this time when new goods are in demand, the reason why the source of supply is not strong is not that there are no goods in the production area, but that the rivers in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are dry, and loading and transportation are not keeping up. Also, candle makers in various places are manufacturing New Year's candles, and the usage is naturally different from usual. They are procuring from Hankou at the same time, and spot goods are therefore insufficient for distribution. The market has also risen accordingly. According to a letter received yesterday from Hankou, Chongjing has been increased to 18 yuan per dan, Pingjing to 17.45 yuan, and Macheng oil to 16.56 yuan, about one yuan higher than the opening price. Local traders have processed 4,000 to 5,000 pieces, which are starting to be shipped continuously. Therefore, the Changjiang ferryboats have had arrivals every day, and sales prices have also been increased based on Hankou prices. Chongjing is selling for 21.78 yuan per dan, Pingjing for about 21 yuan, and Macheng is sold by city weight at 18 yuan plus some change. Zhejiang asphalt has also risen along with it. It is heard that Inner Ping oil is sold for 20.23 yuan, and there is also talk of Lanbai oil being above 16 yuan. It is not known if this is accurate. Zhejiang Western car oil is said to require 21 yuan delivered to Shanghai, which is excessively high. A price of 20.56 yuan by city weight seems fair. Among the local goods, only Jiangxi oil continues to arrive. Yang Chunhe, an old brand, previously opened a guest price of 20.05 yuan, but now it is feared that it will not be less than 21 yuan. As for oils from Wenzhou and Taizhou, the goods are inferior, so the guest price is still within 20 yuan. However, this rise is not entirely driven by candle sales in various places, but also because the Benchang soap factory used about 10,000 dan, resulting in squeezing from both sides.</p>

<h3>Auctioning Civilization</h3>
<p>— Fengzi</p>
<p>Humanity is truly the most civilized thing. The world has reached a point today where it can't possibly be more enlightened. Even livestock, it is said, should be treated with kindness. Mr. Hitler has banned cruelty to mute animals; the Scottish Secretary of State does not allow disturbance of the Loch Ness monster; and the Japanese Minister of the Army posthumously awarded the highest medal to the military dog that died in the attack on the North Barracks. These three events may be different in circumstances, but they are all grand ceremonies of civilized nations, without a doubt.</p>
<p>When Mr. Hitler first ascended to the throne, his most notable act of virtue was burning books, excluding dissidents, and expelling Jews, followed by this order to protect mute animals. At first glance, it seems a bit comical that these things come from the same person, but in reality, the former are his true intentions, while the latter is just the old trick of "killing and covering up traces."</p>
<p>Civilization must wait for a good price to be sold, but it can also be auctioned off at a discount.</p>
<p>English gentlemen are even more civilized than Mr. Hitler. The Loch Ness monster does not appear often and does not pose a threat to the empire. Moreover, this monster has something that pleases the gentlemen, which is its "strangeness"; therefore, when the announcement was made, "public opinion was greatly relieved," which is also the reason. When Gandhi went to England, English gentlemen flocked to the pier to welcome him; they were not welcoming Gandhi for his ability to fight for freedom for India, but simply to admire this strange Indian skinny elephant. This is exactly the same mentality as welcoming the Haikyo Berman Circus.</p>
<p>So, welcome as they may, India is still India. Kindness has actually reached the livestock, it seems that civilization is only fit to be auctioned off.</p>
<p>The treasure admired by the Japanese Minister of the Army is the military dog. Since it is a meritorious dog, it should be treated equally. Moreover, Japan is a rising civilized nation. However, calling a dog a military dog is too blatant. Moreover, the blood of the North Barracks, the corpses of Shenyang, and even the skeletons of the four provinces are said to be compatriots of ours. But the price of civilization is too extravagant for these compatriots, and this benefit is instead taken by livestock.</p>
<p>Chinese people probably still have to appreciate these civilizations with tears in their eyes.</p>
<p>However, as long as they are high-class or upper-class Chinese, they actually still have an "inherent" civilization, which is "gentlemen eat meat but stay away from the kitchen." But this is not auctioned off.</p>
<p>To put it more bluntly, it's not even worth talking about auctioning.</p>
<h3>On Realistic Novels in Response to Mu Mutian</h3>
<p>— Chen Junye</p>
<p>The issue of "Realistic Novels and First-Person Writing" has already sparked serious discussion, which, as Mr. Mu said, is not without its benefits. Therefore, even though Mr. Mu and I still hold different opinions, I still have something to say. I must first clarify that Mr. Mu and I do not have different arguments. If the arguments were different, the discussion would be less meaningful.</p>
<p>(1) In "Further Discussion on Realistic Novels and First-Person Writing," Mr. Mu believes that "in the current culturally backward China, writing novels about peasants and workers in the first person is more likely to become glib." I believe that Mr. Mu's understanding includes many incorrect tendencies. This can easily develop into the idea that novels depicting peasants and workers should only appear after Chinese culture has improved and peasants and workers themselves can write novels. Needless to say, this is a wrong understanding and a very dangerous one. If we want to trace the root of this error, it is nothing more than standing on the viewpoint of analytical realism (there is no doubt that Mr. Mu has been deeply influenced by Flaubert's thinking), believing that only reflecting objective reality in a photographic manner is beneficial to truth, and that "Yang Ma's Diary" must be written by Yang Ma herself, and must be written so clumsily to be considered true. However, only those simple bystanders are satisfied with this vulgar naturalism or analytical realism. Mr. Mu is precisely one of these bystanders (his theory proves it). He boldly separates peasants and workers from the author, placing them in two different positions. The author is never completely irrelevant to the characters in the work, but only observes and expresses them with a bystander's attitude. I cannot but say that this understanding is the greatest crisis in Mr. Mu's thinking.</p>
<p>(2) In the past, the first-person writing style was commonly used by romantic writers as a means of expressing their individualism and lyricism. I have long admitted this fact. However, when the first-person writing style is used in new content (expressing the emotions of the peasant and worker class), it can no longer be regarded as a form of individualistic lyricism. Due to its different essence, its form has been transformed in a new direction, and it can no longer be called an old form. Mr. Mu cited Bedny's use of the fable poetry form to write many popular poems, and even admitted that its content was new, but its fable poetry form was still old. This is an even more incorrect understanding. If we examine the differences between Bedny's fable poems and other ancient fables, we can obtain proof. When an old form is suitable for new content and is adopted as a means of expression, this form is no longer old. I dare to repeat a sentence here. If we do not grasp the whole and its dynamic characteristics in our understanding of a problem, we will inevitably fall into the narrow path of bourgeois one-sided understanding and knowledge.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the issue of the truthfulness of literature, Mr. Mu said that it is inversely proportional to the amount of complex reality reflected in it. From this sentence, I believe that Mr. Mu is again committing the fundamental defect of naturalist theory. The acquisition of the truthfulness of literature lies in grasping the practical knowledge of sensual human activity. Naturalists determine it by describing the quantity of the scope, so the characteristic of naturalist literature is to observe and list all things regardless of value. Their purpose is to be all-encompassing, and they believe that they can obtain objective "truth" in that way, which has resulted in the precision and tediousness of naturalism to an infinite extent. Is this also the amount that Mr. Mu requires for literary truthfulness? If we measure the truthfulness of a literary work, and we only observe the scope it describes to determine its level, wouldn't it be a joke? Regarding this issue, Mr. Mu's criticism of me has not only failed to obtain a more advanced theory, but has instead increased incorrect views, which makes me sincerely regret it.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the issue of first-person writing and realistic novels, we must stand on socialist realism in order to grasp the correct understanding. Merely staying in naturalist realism, strolling in the area of pure bystanderism, and only knowing to explore techniques and forms for realism, I can judge that he will never obtain a bright path to walk on. The realism of Balzac, Zola, etc. is not what we require now. What we now require is comprehensive realism!</p>
<h3>New Year's Eve</h3>
<p>— Chen Fuxi</p>
<p>New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>In a warm room, a young couple is having a sumptuous dinner. The room is quiet, with only the two of them—</p>
<p>"Jane, I'll pick a piece of chicken for you, the chicken is especially delicious today..."</p>
<p>The wife didn't respond, nor did she nod.</p>
<p>Filled with melancholy, this silent room:</p>
<p>She sits, frowning, remembering something she had forgotten. She doesn't , nor does she drink alcohol; painful memories keep disturbing her mind. Her face is pale, thin, and haggard, suffering from severe hysteria. She is already in her thirties, but she looks like she is in her forties; but she still has no children...</p>
<p>Tonight, she sits at the table, unable to eat anything. Although the table is full of fish, meat, and chicken, which are fresh, oily, and delicious, her throat always feels like it is blocked with a cork.</p>
<p>She can't even swallow a drop of soup.</p>
<p>The husband didn't hear his wife's answer, so he said again:</p>
<p>"Why are you so unhappy?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm very happy..."</p>
<p>She reluctantly raised her head and shook it a few times; then, she lowered her head again. For a long time: Crystal tears dripped down from her eyes in strings.</p>
<p>The room is quiet.</p>
<p>He watched his wife cry, no longer in the mood to drink. His heart was also in turmoil. He really didn't understand her, why was she sobbing at this New Year's Eve dinner? He also didn't know what she was so sad about? He just stared at her, dumbfounded, with many words he wanted to say, but even one sentence was difficult to utter. He didn't know how to say it to comfort her, to stop her sobbing?</p>
<p>"Jane, why are you crying? Tonight is New Year's Eve, we should be happier..."</p>
<p>"Yes, we should... I don't want to anymore..."</p>
<p>"Think about what?" the husband immediately asked.</p>
<p>"Think about our little baby..."</p>
<p>The wife couldn't continue, her voice trembling. Hearing these words, all the sorrow in the husband's stomach welled up in his heart, making him unable to suppress it. However, seeing his wife cry, seeing his wife stunned, he had no choice but to say to her:</p>
<p>"Don't think about her anymore, tonight is New Year's Eve..."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he involuntarily picked up his wine glass and drank several sips in a row.</p>
<p>The wife cries...</p>
<p>The room is quiet.</p>
<p>Because he drank too much wine, the husband was almost drunk. The husband's eyes were red, and he was almost crying too.</p>
<p>After drinking a lot of wine, he suddenly remembered something and asked:</p>
<p>"If our little baby didn't die, how old would she be?"</p>
<p>"Ah ha! Have you forgotten?" the wife said, crying, her voice still trembling.</p>
<p>"Forgot! Completely forgot!"</p>
<p>"Eh, have you really forgotten? Our little baby's zodiac sign is Rabbit!... "</p>
<p>"Hmm, that's right! If she didn't die, she would already be..."</p>
<p>He only said half of the sentence before he poured the wine glass to his lips again.</p>
<p>The room is quiet.</p>
<h3>Wells's Prophecy: A Record of the Sino-Japanese War in 1935</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhen</p>
<p>With the arrival of the New Year, prophecies have become very popular for a time, and several magazines are requesting prophecies for 1934. Originally, we live in such an enlightened world, what else can we say? So, we can only predict the future.</p>
<p>HG Wells's prophecy was reported by Reuters in September, and I remember that the newspapers in Shanghai all published it. In addition to being a historian, the author of "The Outline of History" is also known as a socialist, civilization critic, and popular novelist. There is no need for any introduction, and I think everyone knows it. But what is particularly worthy of our attention is his scientific observation, far-reaching imagination, and sharp criticism. Therefore, since the publication of his prophetic novel "The Shape of Things to Come," it immediately aroused excitement among readers around the world.</p>
<p>Recently, this book has also arrived in China. According to his own description, this is like his previous book, "A Short History of the World" (translated by Fan Zhongyun, published by Commercial Press), which is a future short history describing the 150 years from 1913 to 2116. He pretends that it is Dr. Raveu's dream book, as if it is just a "castle in the air prophecy," but in fact, it has a very strong realistic color, especially the first volume, "Today and Tomorrow," which is simply a history of the past twenty years. The second volume and below are about the future, but the writing and arguments are based on scientific and economic theories, so even if it is a dream, it can be said to be a scientific dream.</p>
<p>The entire book is divided into five volumes, first describing the arrival of the collapse period (Volume 1), followed by the collapse period, the third is the revival of the world, that is, the birth of modern countries, the fourth is the modern national movement, and the fifth is the life jointly managed by modern countries, about 200,000 words. According to his prophecy, the world war in the 1940s was within the collapse period, and the prelude to it was the Sino-Japanese War in 1935, which later turned into the US-Japanese War. By 1939, it ended with Japan's defeat. After the world war, the capitalist world that only sought self-interest collapsed completely, and by the 21st century, it embarked on the road of building a new world. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (8) (5)</h3>
<p>— Written by Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>When she brought the wine, he said again:</p>
<p>"I came specifically to say goodbye to you. I'm going out."</p>
<p>She replied without paying attention:</p>
<p>"Ah, ah! Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"America."</p>
<p>"I heard it's a beautiful country."</p>
<p>She didn't say anything else. Really, it was really rash to talk to her today. There were really too many people in the coffee shop today.</p>
<p>So Pierre went out and walked towards the beach. When he walked to the embankment, he saw the "Pearl" fishing boat carrying his father and Captain Boziru back. The sailor Babagri was rowing the oars; the two people sat at the stern with a very happy look on their faces, smoking their pipes. The doctor looked at them passing by, thinking in his heart: "Simple-minded people are really happy."</p>
<p>So he sat on a stool on the breakwater, trying to numb himself into a beastly semi-sleep state.</p>
<p>When he returned home in the evening, his mother didn't dare to raise her eyes to look at him, she just said to him:</p>
<p>"You need to buy a lot of things before you leave, but I don't know where to start. I just ordered some shirts and trousers for you, and told the tailor to come and make clothes for you; but don't you need anything else, don't you need something I haven't thought of?"</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to say: "No, I don't need anything." But he thought he had to at least accept the clothes that would make him look decent, so he replied in a very quiet voice:</p>
<p>"I don't know yet; I'll have to ask at the company."</p>
<p>He went to ask, and someone gave him a list of necessities. When his mother took the list from his hand, it was the first time in a long time that she looked at him, and there was a kind of pleading expression in her eyes, so humble, so gentle, so sad, like a poor dog begging for mercy after being beaten.</p>
<p>On October 1st, the "Lorraine" mail ship sailed from Saint-Nazaire into the port of Havre, so that it would sail from there to New York on the 7th of the same month: and Pierre Roland had to live in that small floating room, where his life would be imprisoned afterwards.</p>
<p>The next day, when he went out, he met his mother on the stairs, and she said to him softly in a voice that was almost inaudible:</p>
<p>"Don't you want me to help you arrange your room on the ship?"</p>
<p>"No, thank you, it's all arranged."</p>
<p>She muttered:</p>
<p>"I really want to see your room."</p>
<p>"No need to see it. It's very ugly and very small."</p>
<p>He passed by, leaving her there devastated and leaning against the wall, pale.</p>
<p>But it was old man Roland who had visited the "Lorraine" mail ship that day, and he talked about this magnificent ship at dinner, and he was quite surprised that his woman had no intention of taking a look, because their son was going to take this mail ship.</p>
<p>In the following days, Pierre simply wasn't often home. He was neurasthenic, easily angered, cold-blooded, and his rude words seemed to whip everyone. But on the day before he left, he suddenly appeared very different, appearing very gentle. When he embraced and kissed his parents before going to sleep on the ship for the first time, he asked them:</p>

<h3>Is it Business Acumen?</h3>
<p>— Han Dehui</p>
<p>If you want to save trouble and go to a clothing store to buy a newly made or original dress, the shop assistant will definitely take out many new and old clothes of different materials and colors for you to choose from, and very politely ask you to try them on. When you put the clothes on your body, he will definitely make an unexpected expression of joy, saying: "Sir! This dress seems to be specially made for you, it couldn't be more perfect, it couldn't fit better!" If you think it's too short, he will say: "Sir! Look down at yourself!" When you lower your head and bend forward, the front of the dress will also droop down, and naturally you won't feel it's short. If you think it's too long, he will say: "Sir! Your body is not straight enough!" When you straighten your body according to his words, the front of the dress will naturally be raised, and you won't feel it's long; but the back droops down and sweeps the ground, but you don't have eyes in the back, so you can't see it. After his directing, you are indeed satisfied, and then the transaction is successfully completed. As for whether this dress fits well or not, that's another matter; in short, he has made this business.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen go to silk and satin shops to buy clothing materials, and they always want to get a little discount on the size. For example, if she wants to buy ten feet of clothing material, when the shop assistant measures ten feet and is about to cut it off, she hurriedly grabs it with her hand and doesn't allow the scissors to cut, saying: "Let go! Let go! Let go! Let go!" Two inches is not enough, four inches is not enough, six inches is still not enough, eight inches is still not enough, and even letting go by more than a foot is satisfying. If you don't agree, she will not only scold you for being too inflexible in business, but she may also pout, puff out her cheeks, and walk away angrily carrying her money bag. Therefore, in order to make the transaction, the shop assistants let go when they are told to, and they don't dare to cut until she is not very insistent on letting go. But when she returns home and measures the clothing material herself with a ruler, isn't it still ten feet? How much more did she gain from arguing? Originally, the shop assistants knew the temper of the ladies and gentlemen well, and they deducted one inch from each foot when measuring,</p>
<p>The foot that was let go later had already been reserved in advance; because if they didn't do so, this business would be taken away by another store.</p>
<p>I don't know if the above two things are what is called "business acumen"?</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h3>Eating Chicken Tails</h3>
<p>— Chen Geng</p>
<p>I was opening the new ledger that I had just received in the workshop when the boy Ah Bao jumped in and said, "Mr. Chen, that doctor who vaccinates against smallpox is here again."</p>
<p>"Hmm, where is he?"</p>
<p>"In the manager's office."</p>
<p>In the manager's office, a table was laid out with large and small bottles, as well as sharp, shiny probes. One was wearing a Chinese cotton robe, one was wearing Western clothes, and another was a woman wearing a white coat. They said they were all doctors.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your hard work," the manager said to the one wearing Western clothes.</p>
<p>"It's okay, I'm just doing this job. It's unlucky to be assigned to the factory area, dealing with scary workers..." He replied.</p>
<p>The woman shrugged her shoulders and looked at the clock on the wall: "Mr. Manager, will you get vaccinated? If you want to, I'll do it for you first. The furniture is cleaner at this time."</p>
<p>"Hehehehehe, okay, thank you, but, hehe, there's also my wife. She hasn't been vaccinated since she was a child, hehe, I'd also like to trouble you." The manager said with a smile, unbuttoning his collar as he ordered someone to invite the manager's wife from the back.</p>
<p>First, the doctor wearing the cotton robe applied a layer of lotion to the manager's thick, fat arm, then the female doctor vaccinated him, and then the doctor wearing Western clothes covered him with a bandage. Then, the manager's wife, the deputy manager... were all vaccinated, the same thick, fat arms, the same perfect surgery.</p>
<p>It's the staff's turn to get vaccinated. They came in and out of the manager's office very quickly. Did they use a different, simpler surgery to vaccinate the junior staff? But it's the same vaccination, isn't it? Hmm, no money?</p>
<p>But some people were unwilling to get vaccinated, pretending to go to the toilet to urinate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was called by the deputy manager to get vaccinated. I was very unwilling in my heart, but I didn't dare to disobey the good intentions of my superiors. I took off my long gown in the workshop, passed through the corridor, passed through the square, and it was terribly cold. A minute later, I enjoyed the right to get a free vaccination. However, at the moment of vaccination, the doctor's nose seemed to sense something strange. I can only blame myself for not taking a bath for two weeks, and my undershirt and jacket were all dirty. However, it is also true that I don't have time to take a bath. Who doesn't like cleanliness? Who doesn't pay attention to hygiene? But, you also need time to pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene.</p>
<p>So I ran out of the manager's office in embarrassment.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, are you happy? The female doctor vaccinated you, haha!" The driver of car number sixteen joked with me with a hippie smile. Joked, who knows the anger in my stomach.</p>
<p>After the staff was finished, it was the workers' turn.</p>
<p>The boy Ah Bao jumped in first, but was immediately scolded out by the manager because he didn't remove the bird-hunting hat on his head, which was too impolite.</p>
<p>"Does it hurt?"</p>
<p>"It's just like a mosquito bite."</p>
<p>"They say they're doctors, but they're so rough."</p>
<p>"They're naturally not polite to us workers."</p>
<p>………………………</p>
<p>After the male workers were finished, it was the female workers' turn.</p>
<p>But none of the female workers went. Think about it, how could the girls not be shy about taking off their clothes in the manager's office? As a result, only a few young girls were called in.</p>
<p>The doctors left, and six out of ten in the whole factory were vaccinated. You look at my arm, and I look at your arm. What did you see? Aren't they just the same two fresh blood marks, with no cover and no gauze bandage, exposed, blown by the cold wind, and stained by dust. Old Wang said: "After getting vaccinated, you have to eat fresh food, eat chicken, the more the better." The cook Ah Wu said: "A pair of chickens were killed, weighing two catties and four taels, but, hehe! They were killed for the manager's wife to eat."</p>

<p>"... We still want to eat chicken, and we can't even get a sip of chicken soup."</p>
<p>"Eat chicken, eat chicken tails... Hahahaha..."</p>
<p>"Hahahaha..."</p>
<p>I didn't respond, but leaned over in the workshop to open the new ledger, swallowing a mouthful of saliva with a "gulp."</p>
<h3>Manuscript Fees and Life</h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<p>In the afternoon of January 8, 1934, at 3:20 PM.</p>
<p>In front of the window of the accounting department on the second floor of the Shen Bao newspaper office, a crowd of people who lived off manuscript fees were packed together - old, young, male, and female.</p>
<p>The accounting department window was a small hole, just like a ticket window at a train station, with the words "…count clearly in person, no claims accepted after leaving…" written on it. Inside the window sat the clerks wearing glasses, two, three, four of them, the sounds of foreign money and abacuses constantly flying from the window to the outside.</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>I walked over, and there were already many people, at least twelve or thirteen. Quickly, the dialogue of two voices flew past my ears.</p>
<p>"Old Li, when did you arrive?"</p>
<p>"I've been here for a long time. I came yesterday and didn't get paid."</p>
<p>"How many articles do you have?"</p>
<p>"Three."</p>
<p>"Probably more than ten yuan."</p>
<p>"I don't know. They say the first article pays more. I only had one published at the top. Last time I had four and received eight yuan and forty cents."</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>Someone left the window, looking like a worker. The person called Old Li immediately squeezed forward. Then two more people walked up from downstairs. Several people in student attire nodded, smiled, and started chatting while shaking hands. The two newcomers became the center of the conversation. They talked about manuscript fees, literature, the *Eastern Miscellany*, and middle school students. As the conversation became more and more lively, they also talked about Lu Xun, Mao Dun, Zhou Shoujuan, and Zhang Henshui. This was a very brief literary salon.</p>
<p>The person called Old Li passed the seal he used when submitting his manuscripts through the window, his eyes following the accountant's hands as they moved. His eyes moved from the ledger to the abacus, and then to the banknotes. Finally, he received the money, totaling five yuan and twenty cents. He hesitated for a moment, seemingly wanting to get more.</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>"Old Li! You can see two more movies!" A burst of laughter.</p>
<p>"Movies! This is for eating!"</p>
<p>Old Li left, and then I took his place. There were more than a dozen other candidates behind me. As soon as I walked out, these words appeared in my mind: "Ah! This is for eating!"</p>

<h3>Regarding the Question of "What is Our Guiding National Ideology?"</h3>
<p>— Zhiping</p>
<p>In the 57th issue of this journal, Mr. Gongpu posed an important question to us: "What is our guiding national ideology?" Although I do not have "the talent to govern a country," I can be considered a member of the citizenry, and I should contribute my opinion based on the principle that "the rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every citizen."</p>
<p>In China, where everything is chaotic and nothing is unified, if we bring up the question of "what is our guiding national ideology" for discussion, we can get many different answers: the guiding national ideology of the Three Principles of the People, the guiding national ideology of social democracy, the guiding national ideology of Fascism, the guiding national ideology of Bolshevism, the guiding national ideology of nationalism… All of these are specific answers to this question. But the problem is here: among this large batch of answers, which one is correct? That is, which one can build China, revitalize China, and be worthy of being called a guiding national ideology?</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Shih once told us, "Study more problems and talk less about isms." Although I cannot agree with this "divide and conquer" method, in these times, I dare not believe in any ism, let alone discuss anything under it. Therefore, my answer to the question of "what is our guiding national ideology" cannot and dares not say what ism is worthy of being our guiding national ideology. I can only first follow Dr. Hu's method, and first propose several fundamental problems in China to study, and then make an overall solution to the problems.</p>
<p>First, everyone knows that China is a semi-colonial country, and all of China's economic and political rights are controlled by imperialists. China's poverty and all of China's disasters are caused directly and indirectly by the imperialists. Therefore, China should not talk about nation-building, but if it wants to talk about nation-building, it must fight desperately with imperialism, completely abolish all unequal treaties, implement true tariff autonomy, and even fundamentally overthrow the imperialist rule over China, in order to strive for the complete independence of the Chinese nation!</p>
<p>Second, the unresolved land problem in China is the main reason for the bankruptcy of the rural economy, social unrest, and the withering of industry. Therefore, to enable China to maintain the normalcy of a country and develop side by side with the advanced countries of the world, it is necessary to completely solve the land problem, stabilize the countryside, and increase rural purchasing power, in order to prosper the entire national economy.</p>
<p>Third, most of China's citizens are currently under the threat of unemployment, poverty, hunger, and so on. If China is to be worthy of being called a truly civilized country, it must first completely solve all problems of production and distribution and fundamentally eliminate those phenomena.</p>
<p>Fourth, under the solution of the above three problems, we can talk about developing Chinese industry, thereby popularizing education, developing culture, so that China is worthy of being called a modern civilized country, and washing away the shame of "all backwardness."</p>
<p>The above four points are the several fundamental problems of Chinese society that are currently blocking the majority of our compatriots and demanding a solution. Any ism that can solve these fundamental problems can be used as our guiding national ideology. Conversely, an ism that cannot solve these fundamental problems, or even hinders the solution of these problems, is a national destruction ideology.</p>
<p>Of course, no matter what thought or ism, it must be the product of society or a group of people, and it must be implemented by people. Around all isms are many people. The so-called ism that can solve the current fundamental problems in China, that is, the ism that is worthy of being called our guiding national ideology, must also be implemented by many people. In the current China, who can implement this? That is, who are the ones who truly have that kind of guiding national ideology, and who can truly solve the current fundamental problems in China? I don't know. However, I think, if everyone is not forgetful, they should remember that since "September 18th," among the general citizens of China, who are the most capable of resisting Japan and opposing imperialism, and who are the most capable of fighting for the solution of the current fundamental problems in China.</p>
<p>As for which books and publications can represent our guiding national ideology in the current China, it is also difficult to say. It is best to ask everyone to observe according to the above principles—as long as it is supported by the masses who can solve all the current fundamental problems in China, and represents their consciousness, it is a publication or book that represents our guiding national ideology.</p>

<h3>Nationalist Art and Theater Troupes</h3>
<p>— A Member</p>
<p>Many people regard art as a pleasure for a few, but history tells us that art is also produced by human beings for practical needs. Primitive people created writing and sculpture to help their memory, and music and poetry can be said to have originated in this way to forget the fatigue of labor and to match the rhythm of work, from the initial "Hang Yu" sounds to the present.</p>
<p>Each nation has its own special component of art. And this unique art is the nourishment for each nation's own spirit. At the same time, national art must also be the soul of the nation. This is not because of other reasons; all races, bloodlines, modes of production, and geographical environments are the reasons for the formation of special art.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this era of survival of the fittest among nations, we must grasp our own national art, promote it, and make it become the greatest driving force of the nation.</p>
<p>Drama, in China, has a very long history: Yuan opera, Kun opera, Peking opera, Han opera, all the way to Shanghai's "civilized drama"... But most of these things are "the remnants of feudalism." We naturally cannot take them as good nourishment for the nation, let alone promote national progress. Therefore, the emergence of the spoken drama movement is really a good phenomenon of emerging culture.</p>
<p>Drama is generally considered a comprehensive art in art theory, so it is the most suitable mass art. However, the public performances of emerging dramas in the past have not only been very weak, but have also only been the playthings of a part of the intellectual class. I hope that every theater troupe will become a mass art organization and use reality to promote our increasingly declining old nation.</p>

<h3>The Final Order</h3>
<p>— Fu Fusheng</p>
<p>Guilin, Guangxi Correspondence</p>
<p>Because I am an intellectual, I was promoted to sergeant squad leader in less than two months after joining the army; but as a squad leader, the responsibility is of course heavier. For example, one small thing, the problem of distributing side dishes for each meal, a squad of more than a dozen people, the kitchen only has a large bowl of dishes, and I, as the squad leader, have to distribute them to each person. If I occasionally distribute them unevenly, they will complain, and even many misunderstandings will arise. About four or five months ago, when our troops were marching in the border area of ×× province, the common people ran away at the news, and took all the things they ate and used with them. As a result, we couldn't buy rice for several days in a row, so we had to find some melon vegetables and taro to cook and fill our stomachs. I remember that at that time, our battalion commander's horse died of illness and was abandoned on the side of the road. People from each company almost started shooting at each other in order to fight for the meat of this dead horse. This shows how serious the problem of eating is. Talking about the problem of sleeping is even more unspeakable. There are often times when we sleep on the lawn or under the eaves of the street, and in the middle of the night, there is a torrential rain, soaking our bodies, it is really unbearable. As for our officers, the situation is different. All units above the company level have small kitchens. If they arrive in a place where they can't buy food, they have canned food. If they pass through prosperous towns, they always eat chicken, fish, and other delicacies. The general soldiers have not received their salary for several months, and the one or two yuan of pocket money they receive each month is still saved from the food expenses. Where do they have the money to enjoy the pleasures of the palate?</p>
<p>The above is a glimpse of the suffering of soldiers' lives. The following will talk about the situation during combat.</p>
<p>Since I started living in the army, I have participated in several formal battles. Once, our regiment was assigned as the vanguard, and our company was rotated to serve as the point man. One morning, while searching and advancing, we were discovered by the enemy's sentry. The enemy bugler blew his horn to inquire about us, so we scattered and lay down, and started shooting. In less than half an hour, the two sides' firing lines spread for more than a mile, and the sound of artillery and gunfire shook the heavens and the earth. As a result of this battle, more than 300 of our brothers were killed or injured. Some had their heads blown open, some had their intestines ruptured, and some were lying on the ground, writhing and groaning, asking for a shot to be put out of their misery. Another time, we fought bitterly for a day and a night, and the battle line did not advance. Although the division commander repeatedly issued orders to "save ammunition and advance quickly," still few people were effective. Suddenly, the division commander came to a hilltop and sternly instructed our regimental commander: "At 8:00 tonight, a general attack on the entire line. Everyone must</p>

<h3>■Four Modern Art Photos for One Dollar Additional Sacrifice… Free Colored Photo</h3>
<p>Recently, people from all walks of life have liked to take art photos, and the establishment of photo studios has also sprung up like mushrooms. Those who can excel in technology and produce exquisite results are actually not many. Even if there are one or two productions that are still good, the price is surprisingly high, which makes people retreat. Therefore, although they have a love for art, they have no suitable place to try. Only the Shanghai Modern Art Photo Studio (opposite the Dadong Hotel on Nanjing Road, Yinhua Street) can indeed exchange the lowest price for outstanding art. It is heard that four 4-inch art photos are only one dollar, three 6-inch art photos are one and a half dollars, and two 8-inch full-body photos are two dollars. Now, in order to promote art, anyone who comes to take the above three types of photos will receive a colored photo as a gift (must bring this advertisement to receive the gift). In addition, the studio has experience in taking photos of celebrations and groups outside the door, and photo enlargement is especially its specialty. ▲▲▲▲▲▲………………………………………………▼▼▼▼▼▼</p>
<h3>■Sure Cure for Chilblains Already Rotten ●● Not Ulcerated Miracle Drug Already Rotten Chilblains… Healed in Days Unbroken Chilblains… Swelling Gone on the Same Day</h3>
<p>Chilblains are caused by congealed blood stasis. At the beginning, they are red and swollen, causing unbearable pain and itching. After they are ulcerated, thick pus drips out, and the pain is even worse. This disease is especially common in late winter and early spring, and the world lacks effective prescriptions, causing patients to suffer. Fortunately, the Benbu Zhengwei Pharmacy (West Heng Street, next to Wing On Company on Nanjing Road) has invented two kinds of miracle drugs: (1) "Pearl White Jade Ointment" is used to treat broken chilblains, removing decay and generating new flesh, with miraculous healing speed. (2) "Chilblain Wishful Water" is used to treat unbroken chilblains, stopping pain and itching immediately, and eliminating redness and swelling immediately. The price is extremely low. "Pearl White Jade Ointment" is sold for only four cents per box, and "Chilblain Wishful Water" is sold for two cents per bottle. For mail orders from other places, please add two cents for postage.</p>
<p>must charge forward." Of course, we accepted this order on time; and in order to accept this order, several dozen brothers fell on the blood-stained ground and could not get up. Unexpectedly, the next day, the sound of gunfire and artillery on our side slowly subsided. Just as everyone was wondering, we suddenly heard the company commander shouting: "According to the battalion commander's notification, the division commander and other troops had already begun to retreat at 8:00 last night; now everyone quickly retreats to the ×× assembly point!" I got this news and realized that leaving our regiment was to be used as a covering force for the main force's retreat, prepared to be sacrificed. So I rolled down several hills in one breath, and was out of breath when I ran to the assembly point. Since we served as this covering force, whenever we sat around and chatted, we felt lingering fear in our hearts when we brought up this incident.</p>
<p>The Final Reckoning of 1933 (Part 1)</p>
<h3>A Miniature of International Politics in 1933</h3>
<p>— Ms. Luo Jie</p>
<p>1933 was the fifth year of the capitalist world's panic. In this year, the world's imperialists racked their brains to implement all measures to overcome the panic: they held the World Economic Conference, they built high tariff barriers, they implemented inflation, they chanted the "controlled" economy, and they put forward countless "revival" plans... However, in the melee of "revival," "control," tariffs, and currency, the panic developed more deeply and more widely: the army of unemployed people was flooding like a flood, the imbalance between production and consumption broke past records, and the financial chaos exceeded the levels of previous years since the panic.</p>
<p>Departing from this deep and broad wave of panic, unfolded the tense, dangerous, complex, intricate, kaleidoscope-like international politics of 1933:</p>
<p>First, the bankruptcy of the League of Nations—the League of Nations, an imperialist spoils-sharing conference, could no longer maintain their superficial "alliance" and carry out their deception of spreading "peace" and "assistance" in 1933, when conflicts between imperialists were extremely sharp and the war of redistributing colonies was imminent. Japanese imperialism, in order to facilitate its own exclusive rule over Manchuria and North China, even found this superficial "constraint" a bit annoying, and was the first to tear off this paper-thin mask and "withdraw from the League of Nations"! The Four-Power Pact of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany, although it wanted to ease the conflict between imperialists in Europe and strengthen the anti-Soviet Union front, still could not stop German imperialism from firing a second shot at the League of Nations: "Withdraw from the League of Nations"! This fully illustrates that in 1933, the imperialists could no longer carry out the sharing of spoils in "peace," and were already sharpening their swords and preparing for a second large-scale plundering massacre.</p>
<p>Second, the strengthening of imperialist economic blocs—the complete failure of the London World Economic Conference led to the further strengthening of the economic blocs (Bloc Economies) of various imperialists. Britain, the United States, France, and Japan each possessed their directly controlled territories, colonies, and spheres of influence, implemented high tariff barriers, lowered exchange rates, and used trade reciprocity to protect their own commodity markets and exclude foreign commodities. They used all means to unfold the spectacle of a world market economic war. This is directly the prelude to military war!</p>
<p>Third, the intensification of the imperialist arms race:—The fact that the Geneva Disarmament Conference has become an arms expansion conference has concretely explained this fact. Germany's demand for military equality, Britain, Japan, the United States, France, and Italy's desperate expansion of armaments, the increase in the military budgets of various imperialist countries, and the unprecedented prosperity of the military industry are concrete evidence of this fact.</p>
<p>Fourth, the universality of the political Fascistization of imperialism—Hitler took control of the German regime at the beginning of 1933, and is now the pillar to maintain the last fate of German capitalism; the Fascistization of the Japanese ruling class has become the last watchman of the capitalist world in the Far East, and the Roosevelt's movement in the United States, and the "controlled economy" of various imperialists, are all actually fascist tendencies. This further intensifies the conflicts between imperialists, intensifies the exploitation and oppression of workers and colonies and semi-colonies, and makes the war crisis and the revolutionary crisis more and more urgent.</p>
<p>Fifth, the upsurge of the world anti-imperialist movement—the anti-imperialist struggle of the working class in various imperialist countries has had a wide-ranging development this year. The radicalization of the British Independent Labour Party's actions, and the establishment of the anti-capitalist and anti-fascist united movements of the laboring masses in the United States, France, Italy, Germany, and other capitalist countries, are concrete explanations. In addition, the turmoil in Cuba and Luo Luo, and the development of revolutionary movements in South America, Africa, India, and other places, have all had significant phenomena in 1933.</p>
<p>Sixth, the Soviet Union in 1933—1933 was the second year of the implementation of the Soviet Union's second five-year plan. The gradual progress of socialist construction in Soviet Russia, and the gradual success of its peaceful diplomacy: the signing of the multilateral non-aggression treaty by the Black Sea and Baltic Sea coastal countries, the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia and the United States and Russia, established another milestone in the international politics of this year.</p>
<p>1933 was the year when all imperialist countries in the capitalist world attempted to jointly attack the Soviet Union to solve their own contradictions, but were defeated by the Soviet Union's "peaceful policy"; 1933 was the year when the contradictions and conflicts between imperialists intensified, and everyone sharpened their swords and prepared for slaughter. At the same time, it was also the year when the imperialists intensified the carving up of the world's masses and prepared to use them as cannon fodder.</p>
<h3>The Anglo-Japanese Economic War of 1933</h3>
<p>— Ms. Lu Xiaodai</p>
<p>Britain is an old capitalist country, a predecessor of imperialism, and the world's largest trader. "The British Empire never sets," which means the vastness of the British Empire's colonies, the breadth of the British Empire's world market, and the pride of the British Empire.</p>
<p>However, after the European War, the rapid advancement of American imperialism shook the foundation of the British Empire in the entire world market. In the past two or three years, the leap of the emerging Japanese imperialism has also posed a serious threat to the British Empire's main markets.</p>
<p>The main exports of Japanese imperialism are raw silk, cotton textiles, and rayon. Except for raw silk, cotton textiles and rayon are important exports of the British Empire. This has determined the fierce competition between British and Japanese imperialism in the world market. At the same time, most of the customers for Japanese imperialist cotton textiles and rayon are dominions and colonies of the British Empire. In addition, due to Japan's advanced production technology and cheap labor – which means that Japanese capitalists severely exploit workers – its costs are generally lower than those of Britain; the sharp fall in the Japanese yen gives it an absolute advantage in foreign markets; at the same time, the forcible occupation of Manchuria further supports the spine of Japanese imperialism, and vigorously implements a policy of devaluation and sales (dumping) to foreign countries. As a result, Japanese goods poured into the British Empire's market, launching a desperate economic war between British and Japanese imperialism in 1933!</p>
<p>The main battlefields of the Anglo-Japanese economic war are India, the Straits Settlements, Africa, the Near East, and China. It is clear that the British Empire is adopting a difficult defensive posture, while Japanese imperialism is taking a very fierce offensive.</p>
<p>India is one of the largest colonies of the British Empire and one of its largest treasures. However, British goods in the Indian market are all feeling the pressure and extreme blows of Japanese goods, especially the decline of British cotton cloth is even more significant. The amount of Japanese cotton cloth imported into India has exceeded the amount imported into India from Britain itself. | Japan 650 million yards, Britain only 600 million yards.</p>
<p>In the Straits Settlements, the Dutch East Indies, Turkey and the Near East, Egypt and other African colonies, the same can be seen with the entry and exit of Japanese goods, and the decline of British goods. In Australia and China, although British goods show a trend of development, Japanese goods still rush in like a tide, especially in northern and central China, Japan still occupies an overwhelming advantage.</p>
<p>The panic of the entire capitalist world became even deeper and wider in 1933. Seeing that the overseas market was becoming increasingly narrow, the British Empire naturally could not remain silent and wait for death. Therefore, it mobilized all the territories and dominions of the British Empire, continued the spirit of the Ottawa Conference in June 1932, implemented a counter-attack against Japan, and built high tariff barriers in India, Egypt, Australia, the Straits Settlements, and other African dominions, increasing dumping taxes to prevent the inflow of Japanese goods, and using preferential tariffs to maintain the British goods’ foothold.</p>
<p>Japan is not showing weakness either. When the British colonies, especially India, raised tariffs and abandoned the Japan-India Trade Agreement, Japanese textile capitalists declared a boycott of Indian cotton; at the same time, at the World Economic Conference, the Japanese representatives blatantly declared an anti-British attitude; and further implemented retaliatory tariffs on British goods within the Japanese economic system.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Japanese economic war has intensified! The World Economic Conference had no effect on reconciliation; the Japan-India Simla Conference could not ease their conflict either!</p>
<p>In China, the British Empire is unfolding its fan shape from Hong Kong, implementing an attempt to monopolize South China. However, Japanese goods are still constantly rushing into South China; at the same time, Japan is using Manchuria as a base to unfold a wider fan shape in North China. The Yangtze River area in Central China is an even more contested place for Britain and Japan, the location of the duel.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Japanese imperialist economic war is very sensitive and inevitably reflected in the diplomatic war. The breakdown of the World Economic Conference, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, and the shelving of the disarmament conference all indicate the contradictions and conflicts between imperialists, and the opposition between Britain and Japan has also become sharply apparent.</p>
<p>1933 was a year in which the Anglo-Japanese economic war intensified. However, the past of 1933 did not take away the contradictions and conflicts between British and Japanese imperialism, but only deepened with the arrival of 1934!</p>
<p>The inherent contradictions of capitalism are destined to make British and Japanese imperialists unable to stop their economic competition. The result of their competition is to make the panic of the capitalist world even deeper, to increase the exploitation of the working masses in their respective countries, and to make the oppression of the colonies even more cruel! Finally, it will transform from economic war into military war between imperialists!</p>

<h3>Their Marriage Will Never Break Up</h3>
<p>— Siying</p>
<p>Everyone said that their marriage would not last, but they have not shown any signs of breaking up so far. They are still loving each other, and the longer it lasts, the stronger it becomes. In the film industry of Hollywood, almost everyone thinks this is a very strange thing. The rumour-mongers of Hollywood's divorce industry can no longer use their skills. Who are these two? They are Ann Dvorak and Leslie Fenton, not obscure figures either. Ann Dvorak recently played the leading role in "The Way to Love". That film was originally starred by Sylvia Sidney, the lead actress of "Madame Butterfly" this year. She stopped acting halfway through, so the company borrowed Ann Dvorak from Warner Brothers to play the leading role. This is a very glorious thing for Ann Dvorak. As for Leslie Fenton, he has also played the leading role in many big films in Germany, so he is not without status.</p>
<p>Before they got married, everyone gave them a nickname. Leslie was called "Bad Boy" and Ann? Called "Wonder Girl". Their status, thoughts, and ages were not the same in any way. Their love was just a temporary impulse, without any deep feelings. Therefore, when they were about to announce their engagement, Ann's mother was afraid that their marriage would not last, so she advised them not to act rashly and to wait as friends for at least a year. Ann's mother herself was a stage performer, and she knew the difficulty of balancing marriage and career, and especially feared that their romance would not last. One was a worldly thirty-year-old middle-aged man, and the other was a nineteen-year-old young woman who had not seen much of the world. If they were to go off the rails, Leslie could pack up and go to who knows where.</p>
<p>But Ann Dvorak and the opinions of the general public in Hollywood did not stop the development of their romance. They initially agreed to shorten the one-year friendship trial period to six months because of Ann's mother's advice. But less than three months later, in a moment of impulse, they ran hand in hand to a small place in Arizona to get married. After they got married, they immediately returned to Hollywood to work. They worked hard day and night for five months, and then in another moment of impulse, they left Hollywood.</p>
<p>They took a boat from San Pedro Harbour in California to the south, passed through the Panama Canal to the east, and arrived in New York. This incident caused a sensation in Hollywood, because Ann Dvorak's contract had not yet expired when she ran away from Hollywood. And the next day, a new film was to be shot and everything was ready, but by the next day, Ann Dvorak was nowhere to be found. From New York, they ran to Europe, traveled in England for a long time, and then ran to Germany. Leslie Fenton made several films in Berlin. Ann Dvorak accompanied her husband to filming every day, and completely ignored her contract in Hollywood. When Leslie's filming was over, they took the opportunity to tour Southern Europe, passing through France, Italy, the Mediterranean, etc. to Africa. They were truly willful and indulgent, doing whatever they wanted, and had a great time playing for a total of nine months. Finally, they took a small boat back to America. They drifted at sea for as long as forty-eight days.</p>
<p>But this kind of travel was very beneficial to their marriage, because they had already jumped out of the atmosphere of the bad air in Hollywood. Their long-term travel had transformed them from an ordinary love union into inseparable companions who shared weal and woe. After they returned to Hollywood, the place where they lived, their daily life, everything was above the ordinary life there. They didn't like socialising and rarely attended banquets. They had their own separate life carved out by the two of them, so they could not be disturbed by the rumours of rumour-mongers at all. Of course, there were very sufficient reasons for their marriage to be able to maintain its happiness permanently.</p>

<h3>Review of "Charlie Chan's Greatest Case"</h3>
<p>— Yiqun</p>
<p>Charlie Chan’s Greatest Case</p>
<p>｜Great Shanghai Screening｜</p>
<p>About two years ago, there was a film called "Charlie Chan's Detective Case" screened in Shanghai. Although the reporter did not get to see it, it seems that he still vaguely remembers that it caused a sensation for a while, and it seems that many people respected this detective king, Mr. Charlie Chan, because he could represent the Chinese or Orientals, and make a big splash and show off his skills in foreign lands. At least they were all very satisfied. Unfortunately, the reporter's eyes were too shallow, and he still has regrets!</p>
<p>This time, I was really lucky. Not only did I feast my eyes, but I also feasted my ears. After two years (?), the impression of Mr. Charlie Chan, which I had been missing, was vividly imprinted on my eyes and invaded my heart!</p>
<p>Like the Sherlock Holmes detective stories, Charlie Chan is a detective in a novel. Originally, the nationality of an ideal character can be freely cited by the author. What we should pay attention to now is the author's ideology, and how he understands and portrays this Chinese person.</p>
<p>What impressions does this "Charlie Chan's Greatest Case" give us? I can't help but sigh!</p>
<p>Let's put aside whether the current society's need for detectives and the detectives' tasks for the current society are correct. Let's not talk about these questions for now. Let's admit that the playwright's ideal is to attack the so-called laws and lawyers of the current society through Charlie Chan's detective skills. This point is of considerable significance. However, what great power does this have? Isn't it still just an ordinary love entanglement story? The ordinary love entanglement story selected such a fabricated theme, and the psychology of taking advantage of the topic is really obvious! Exposed without omission!</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at how the playwright portrays the Chinese Charlie Chan.</p>
<p>First, Charlie Chan is a person. Second, Charlie Chan's family is as disorderly and unorganized as a pigsty. Third, Charlie Chan's reproductive ability is high volume production, like pigs and dogs. Fourth, Charlie Chan is a miser. Fifth, the result of Charlie Chan's hard work in investigating the case is for a new car. Sixth, Charlie Chan is Chinese... Aren't these all vividly presented on paper? Charlie Chan is Chinese, that's all!</p>
<p>Isn't this an insult to the Chinese? Here, we can't help but admire the Americans' skill!</p>
<h3>Our Announcement</h3>
<p>— Ling He Moore</p>
<p>Since the advent of film criticism, it is an undeniable fact that Chinese films have been directly affected. Therefore, there are many rumours from the outside that some film entrepreneurs are trying to use film criticism to seek methods that are beneficial to the film business, etc.</p>
<p>Both of us are regular writers of film criticism. Whether or not this kind of bad phenomenon actually exists, we have the need to say a few words.</p>
<p>We will always strive for our own freedom. We are determined to maintain our own personality with a fair attitude. We will never be threatened or enticed by any party. We will always use the fairest words to criticize Chinese film works. | This is our oath. Please, pure and kind readers, strictly monitor us and criticize us. We are most grateful!</p>
<h3>Carlton Screening of "Auspicious Land"</h3>
<p>The Tianyi Film Company's new sound film "Auspicious Land" is one of the three sound films starring Chen Yumei in 1933, directed by Shao Zuiweng, and co-starring Tian Fang, Zhang Zhenduo, Ma Dongwu, and others. The plot depicts young farmers who sacrifice their own interests for the interests of the public, and country girls who do not succumb to the environment. At the same time, it also has considerable enlightenment on breaking superstitions and developing rural water conservancy education. The three Peking Opera excerpts interspersed in the film are especially wonderful. The film has been scheduled to be screened for the first time at the Carlton Grand Theatre in this city starting today, it is said.</p>

<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Watching "Salt Tide"</h3>
<p>— Guang Dou</p>
<p>We have been looking forward to the screening of "Salt Tide" for a long time. Of course, it cannot be denied that this is a very interesting work. But I heard that: many powerful parts were cut off by the censorship authorities, which is very regrettable! As a result, those that were left after the cut and were released cannot deeply and powerfully imprint themselves on our hearts. However, the impression it gives us is at least unforgettable.</p>
<p>For example: the first step and the second step of the salt field... the hardship of the salt workers' work. Zhang Desan was arrested by the salt police and taken to the official's office. Young Master Hu's plan to occupy public land cut off the fuel for the salt workers. These are all things that can make the audience never forget.</p>
<p>The oppression of the petty salt workers by the local tyrants lacks powerful depiction, and the resistance of the salt workers is not very powerful either. In short, this is a mutilated film that has been cut, and it is worth watching to still have such consciousness. (Missing chapter but rewarded)</p>
<h3>My Feelings About "Salt Tide"</h3>
<p>— Yu Bi</p>
<p>"Salt Tide" is the first contribution of the Star Film Company this year.</p>
<p>The plot of this film tells us about the "liveliness" and "innocence" of country girls, the cunning of local tyrants and evil gentry, their "insidious treachery," the "loyalty" and reliability of old salt workers, their honest "purity," the romanticism of young masters, their "licentiousness," the "courageous" struggle of country salt workers, and the victory of "unity."</p>
<p>What does the director tell us in this film? He used all his strength to point out the "hardship" of the salt-making villagers, the means by which local tyrants and evil gentry "exploit" the salt workers. He also had considerable success in terms of technique. Compared with his past achievements, he has made amazing progress; but small flaws are always inevitable. For example, "A'feng" Your relative was detained on "suspicion" of burning illicit salt, but the reason for burning illicit salt was not stated.</p>
<p>Since "A'feng" hates "Xinwu," why did she agree to go to Shanghai with "Xinwu?" Isn't this "A'feng's" psychology too "contradictory?"</p>
<p>As for the actors, Hu Die's "A'feng" deserves our praise for her solemn attitude when "Xinwu" goes to seduce her. Wang Zhengxin's expression is also a success in this film. Gu Meijun's expression is as lively and charming as Hu Die's. Sun Min's expression also satisfies us. Wang Xianqi and Wang Mengshi both have good expressions.</p>

<p>Sally returned home and told Victor about it. Victor was silently pondering in front of the piano. He listened to Sally's words and said listlessly: "What's the use of that? My operetta is not finished yet. I can't finish it here either. I've tried so many times." Sally said: "Don't you like this place?" Victor hurriedly covered up and said: "This place is very good." But Sally had already seen it. She said: "I know you don't like this place." She was about to cry, but she tried her best to suppress herself. After a while, she said: "Okay, darling, let's go somewhere else... to a place where you can work quietly... um, I've got it... let's get married first. Then we'll go to the Riviera for our honeymoon. At that time, only I will be with you... no one else, and you can work and finish your operetta." After she finished speaking, she became happy again.</p>
<p>Victor took her hand and kissed her on the lips. He whispered: "Baby, I really can't think of anything in the world that would be better than being your husband. If I become your husband, I'll be happy to death every day. What I don't want is to be your guest forever, you know?" He wiped away her tears and continued: "As far as now, everything I eat, everything I wear, even this place, is all yours." Sally said: "Didn't we agree to be companions forever and share all the luck?" Victor complained to himself: "That's right, but what can I use to share with you? Do you want to share poverty with you?" Sally asked: "Don't you want to go back to Brussels?" Victor said that was where he started working before. Sally said: "Great, let's go back to Brussels, let's still live in that old house. Isn't that very interesting?" Victor thought of everything in the past, and was so happy that he couldn't speak for a while. He just kissed her on the lips frequently, telling her that she had made him happier than ever.</p>
<p>At this time, the guests downstairs had already gathered, and Victor hurriedly came down to greet the guests. Because he was so happy that he forgot himself, he hummed "Hi diddle dididle...The cat and the lio...The cow jumped over the moon..." as he went downstairs. Odette heard it and pulled her husband: "Darling, listen to how interesting that song is! Do you believe me, if I sing that song, it will cause a sensation again?" So she also hummed along with 'Hi diddle diddle'. Victor explained beside her: "This song is not finished yet, but it will be soon. We are going back to Brussels. Sally will go with me... in a few months..."</p>
<p>"Victor!" Doda rushed in from outside. He bowed and apologized to Odette on the one hand, and said to Victor on the other hand: "I have a word to tell you." So the two of them went to a corner together. Doda politely took out a cigarette case and offered it to Victor. Victor said: "Thank you, I don't smoke. What do you want to say?" Doda said: "It's about Sally. You are too sorry for her. She told me that she is going back to Brussels with you, isn't she?" Victor said: "Yes." (To be continued)</p>
