<h3 id="c31">日本又擴大軍事預算敬 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>日本自岡田内閣成立後。更加大估量所謂一九三五丨一九三六年之國際危機。而提高其國防安全感想。置重於海軍軍備。務求在太平洋海上占絶對優勢。故於明年度海軍預算中。注意於（一）完成第一次海軍補充計劃。並增加新艦維持費。（二）編成新航空隊及其維持費。（三）改造舊艦。（四）添造新艦。此類預算。計有二萬七千五百萬圓日金。再加入旣定經費四萬二千萬圓。及因物價高漲而增加之費用一千九百萬。圓則海軍預算總額。數達七萬一千四百萬圓矣。陸軍方面。有防空充實費。兵備改善費。與滿洲事件費等新要求。不下三萬二千萬圓。與旣定費用二萬三千萬圓。總計約五萬五千萬圓。海陸軍二者合計爲十二萬六千四百萬圓。較之本年度軍費九萬三千六百萬圓。猶多出三萬二千八百萬圓。是眞入於戰時預算時期矣。</p>
<p>日本軍閥迷於太平洋制霸之企圖。復認日本海外貿易之發展。市塲之開拓。必須借海軍之絶對優勢爲助力。始能維持將來之安全。穩保輸出之暢旺。是以岡田上臺之初。陸海軍人卽盛倡國防安全之高調。岡田從而贊助之。以海軍之充實爲先著。遂不顧一切。拚全力以發揮其軍事運用上之特長。如濳行艇之添造。輕重巡洋艦之充實。飛行隊之增加。無一不以擴大太平洋上防禦爲務。質言之。卽實行其所謂亞東門羅主義是也。陸軍方面。雖未立卽增加新師團。然駐東北各地部隊。數逾十萬。而日本國内之第三·第七·第十·第十一·第十六·各師團。及其他特科部隊。均已成爲出征軍。長駐東北各地。而在原駐地帶。又皆召集同等之留守部隊。則日本陸軍。至少已增加十萬左右之常備軍額。至其陸軍方面航空隊之充實。標的在完全更換舊式飛機。并伸展其續航力至一萬二千公里。於是日本空軍可以威脅海參崴。可以往復於香港所澤之間。可以脅制菲利濱而有餘。如此長足進展。誰能不疑其有發動戰禍之意耶。</p>
<p>故日本之擴張軍備。首感危險者。除俄國外。卽爲遠踞太平洋彼岸之美國。美在平時。惕於海軍軍縮會議前途之困難。恐以往比率主義。一旦打破。則遠東均勢。勢將不能維持。將來市塲之拓展。必受阻碍。以現有之海軍軍力論。日本之濳行艇與巡洋艦。已較美國爲優。所不及者僅主力艦與航空隊耳。日本旣據此天然形勢之便利。在西太平洋上。縱無巨大之主力艦。已足以攫菲利濱奪關島而有餘。假令再組成有力之空軍。竊恐亞留仙羣島。亦難容美空軍之穩駐矣。方前日本提倡海軍軍備平等廢除華盛頓與倫敦條約時。美國力主和平。以爲比率不可驟行變更。并更進一步主張再行裁减現有兵力百分之二十。然而日本則盡力擴張。今更空前的增加軍事預算。美國處此。雖極度愼重。能不懼遠東利益之感受損害。而思及時防範之耶。近來美對軍備。大起注意。謀所以保持其夏威夷之前衛根據。建設阿拉斯加之空防。皆爲日本加緊擴張軍事計劃所促成也。</p>
<p>英之於日。經濟上已處於不易調和之地位。今見日本之擴充軍實。着着進行。使遠東市塲。完全受制於日本勢力控制之下。卽遠之如印度以西之安全。亦感威脅。僻處南太平洋之澳洲。復須增加警備。於是遂亦急起直追。而英日之間。愈趨分裂。總之日本增加軍費之結果。徒激起太平洋上之戰雲而已。</p>

<p>（東京）軍部對大藏省要求自明年度增稅以便作爲非常時期之警備費、現正注視藤井藏相關於明年度預算編制抱有若何財政計畫、蓋以現今市面頗有進展、雖云農村疲弊究屬一小部分、應乘此時機將歷年之赤字公債辦理妥善、從速改正財政計畫、而樹立永久財政規模、因此對富豪階級增加稅率、似宣考慮、然僅增稅於富豪階級、其所得之財源實屬少額、且對於軍需工業亦應添設非常時期之稅收但此項辦法、政府所得亦甚微薄、一方面對於正在發達過程中之軍需工業、且恐阻其進展、故在補足財源之意義上所行之增稅、應以交通稅郵政稅及其他由全體國民所徵收者爲得策、非如此則難達到目的、是以軍部方面主張以改正全部稅則爲要圖云、（十二日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（南京）明年度預算編成期前、軍部及貴院一部主張實行增稅論、但大藏省由下列見地、以爲實行增稅尚非其時、（一）一九三五·六年危機之前、國防費及歲出均膨脹、且其將來難以逆料、故歲出若有减少至相當額之希望時、不能實行增稅、（一）若由經濟界之狀况觀之、雖前途光明、然全般民力之餘裕、尚未到達、故今設增稅、則結果破壞方在發展勃興之産業之萌芽、實有喪國民之意氣、（一）一部所謂之非常時所得稅卽使實施、而所得稅額甚微、不能作爲代替公債之有力財源、（一）逐步增稅雖屬必要、惟於租稅系統涉及地方稅、故必須全般考慮、尢應愼重調查减輕農村之負担後、方可實施、（十二日電通社電）</p>

<p>日代表團提出嚴重抗議</p>
<p>會議前途更將陷於僵局</p>
<p>巴達維亞特訊、因日貨傾銷而引起荷蘭政府對印度殖民地施行之統制經濟、其先後頒佈之外貨入口限制律例、已使日貨大受打擊、日方不得已、乃要求舉行一日荷會議、希以此緩和荷方對日之空氣、乃該會自開幕以來、迄將兩月、中間雖曾有專家審查之議、一度略有開展外、不久仍歸黯淡、雙方意見、尚無絲毫之接近、惟最近又發生一事、值得吾人之注意者、卽荷印政府繼限制棉織品入口律例後、又突然宣佈限制瓷器入口三月、此消息發表後、日方大爲震驚、蓋目前荷印之瓷器市塲、日貨佔有大部、若該律實施、不啻將再給與日本一極大打擊、故出席日荷會議之日本代表團、得悉之下、長岡首席代表、立卽向荷印政府提出一强硬之抗議、</p>
<p>日方抗議書大意、略謂「日荷政府間已有預約、在日荷會議期間、對荷印五十六種商品限制律之實施、須延期執行、此次荷方突然在事前毫無申明、違反上述之約言、而發表限制瓷器入口令、此事實違反國際慣例、其理由極不合法、如此則荷方對會議到底有繼續之誠意否、已不得而知、以和好友誼爲基礎、而在會議中出以此等措置、在常道的國際主義觀念及禮儀上、實不能容忍、此後卽如荷印方面如何盡力、希求諒解」云云、我人觀於上述抗議之措辭、可見日方態度强硬、荷方若不讓步、則今後日荷會議之能否繼續舉行、誠難預測矣、</p>
<p>又據七月二十六日東京電、日外務省對於荷印政府發表限制陶瓷器輸入令、曾用談話之方式、發表意見、謂一俟接到正式報告、事態判明時、日本政府將要求荷蘭方面之反省、關於善後辦法、亦已有適當措置之决心云、惟日政府所謂「適當措置之决心」、僅爲一種虚聲恫嚇、抑眞有其所謂辦法、吾人不得而知、但就大勢觀察、荷印日商惟有作消極之罷運而已、至於日當局將不恤以會議决裂、爲孤注之一擲、似亦意料中事也、</p>
<p>至荷印政府此次突然宣佈限制瓷器入口令、雖帶有向日本示威性質、但其内幕、亦不爲無因、據荷印經濟部消息、在不久之前、荷印方面有十四名日本瓷器商、曾組織一會社、其目標極爲遠大、該會社與日本瓷器出口商會社、有密切之關係、擬支配全荷印之瓷器市塲、該會社且曾邀請數家華商及五家歐商參加、并規定各商號之輸入瓷器量及價格等、此種辦法、勢必與當地瓷器業、以極大之影響、故荷印當局乃不得不採取此緊急之處置云、若此言而確、則日本瓷器進口之被限制、仍爲日人之咎由自取、與人何尤、况荷印政府頒佈之限額、乃照去年入口額之百分之百、並未絶對不准日貨進口也、</p>
<p>目下荷印市塲所售之瓷器、日貨確佔有大部份、但我國江西及汕頭所出之瓷器、爲數亦屬不少、據本日傳來之電訊、謂日本瓷商對荷印之限制瓷器入口律、甚爲憤慨、業已停止輸運、此誠我國瓷業對荷印發展之極好機會、我國瓷商宜勿交臂失之、</p>

<h3 id="c183">婦女國貨年會常委表示 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>痛心於舶來化妝品傾銷</p>
<p>感喟女生足趾塗抹蔲丹</p>
<p>丨反對裸腿赤足及男女同浴丨</p>
<p>據國際貿易局發表、今年六個月脂粉香水進口八十五萬、花邊進口近六十萬、他如眞假首飾等化妝品進口、數亦驚人、說者甚謂婦女國貨年之壁壘、業被摧毁、大通社記者、昨晨特赴霞飛路和合坊七十七號、訪晤婦女國貨年運動委員會常委林克聰女士、叩以對化妝品消耗之感想、兹誌所談於后、</p>
<h3 id="c184">心長力绌矯正不易 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>據林氏云、婦女化妝品之鉅額傾銷、已於報上見到、對此深爲痛心、目前婦女崇拜洋貨之心理、實有其悠遠之歷史、婦女國貨年方面、於宣傳展覽兩方、亦盡相當責任、第積習已深、非片刻能矯正、心長力絀、當爲外間所諒解、</p>

<p>林氏繼謂上項化妝品之進口、亦非完全消耗於我國女界、因上海五方雜處、各國婦女均有、故外籍婦女於化妝品之消耗、亦不在少數、同時今年當新稅則頒佈、舶來化妝品、亦在减稅之例、故其輸入、較去年爲激增、此亦一大原因、</p>

<p>林氏語至此、大通社記者當叩以裸腿婦女之以脂粉香水粉飾腿部、是否事實、林氏當謂據本人最近調查所得、此種習尚、最先流行於妓院中、厥後則良家婦女、亦競相仿效、</p>

<p>林氏繼謂最堪感喟者、目前若干學校之女生、亦風靡一時、其愛護腿部之限度、不僅以飾粉洒水爲滿足、於脚趾尖無不細意塗抺蔲丹、昔人句云「六寸圓膚光緻緻、」堪爲今日婦女寫照、第於求學宗旨、不無背戾云、</p>

<p>大通社記者、復叩林氏對平市府禁止裸腿之有無意見、答謂就本人管見、衣服整潔關係禮貌、故對裸腿赤足、認爲無聊、至於婦女之健康、厥關運動、在裸腿上之得益、必微乎其微、而其消耗於腿部之時間金錢、則反可觀、</p>

<p>林氏嗣又抒其對男女同浴意見、謂於衛生上極有妨碍、蓋男子之患傳染病者、必較女子佔多數、則於一池同浴、其危險爲何等、故男女分池、實較穩當、林氏繼對粤省之禁止男女同行同食、謂蓄意在侮辱女性、女界應一致起而反對、至婦女國貨年運動會方面、不久卽將召集會議、討論下半年度之工作計劃云、與銀洋飾物、共值三千餘元云、</p>

<p>兩次揩油均被發覺</p>
<p>一夥雇入頓動疑心</p>
<p>南市薛家浜二四七號德順鮮肉莊、係閔行人徐阿和所開設、該店除聘南翔人江祥生擔任經理外、並雇有帳房張福生、及夥友曹長林（年二十四歲浦東人）等三人、助理店務、該店經理江祥生、年四十六歲、其妻韓氏、年三十八歲、生有子女五口、年均幼稚、江前在小西門外地方廳路某鮮肉莊充任經理、本年春間、徐因聞悉江秉性誠實、辦事勤奮、故從該店挖出、聘任德順莊經理、嗣後江爲便利執行職務起見、遂將其眷屬遷居該店樓上、上月一日上午八時許、該店正值門市上市之際曹竟私將所收買客之肉錢洋兩元、</p>
<h3 id="c192">納入已袋 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>意圖揩油、當爲帳房張福生窺見、張卽據情告江、江卽上前命曹將洋取出、惟因曹抵賴否認、一時氣憤、遂伸手探入曹之袋中、將原洋取出、擲諸檯上、並據實轉告徐知、是夜江自知理屈、乃在徐等面前、各倒清茶一杯、表示歉意、並立誓不再揩油、且要求徐等不將此事向外宣揚、以免妨碍其名譽、當時徐等因其已知改過、故卽允諾作罷、惟因此長林對江、卽不滿意、旋至八日上午十時許、曹奉店主之命、前往小東門某冷藏廠内</p>

<p>時、曹故態復萌、竟乘機揩油鮮肉兩大塊、（共計二十餘斤）價賣於人、詎未幾事爲江經理所聞、當又據情告於店主、徐遂大爲憤怒、乃向曹斥責一番後、逼令將揩油之猪肉、如數賠出、不然、卽予停職、當時曹亦置若罔聞、惟對於江祥生懷恨尤深、邇來該店因營業發達、所有店夥、不敷支配、乃由江新雇一夥助理雜務、不料曹竟誤認該夥、係候其停職後代替其職務者、並憶及江屢次揭發其秘密、憤恨之餘、遽起</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3 id="c198">談人生觀 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>人爲什麽要到世界上來？爲享樂嗎？爲改造社會嗎？或是爲其他的理由嗎？這問題有許多讀者曾來信問過。發出這問題來的讀者們，都感覺到對於人生不知要取什麽態度才好，換一句話說，他們是不能確定自已的人生觀。</p>
<p>空空洞洞地講人生，决不會得到什麽結果。一個人突然跑到世界上來走一躺，幾十年後又忽然地死去了，中途遇到疾病災害時，也許連幾十年也等不到便喪失了生命。在自已的一生中，有時造下罪惡，有時做了偉大的事業，但一樣地都是赤裸裸地來，再手空空地回去，要問到底是爲什麽，實在也說不出個所以然。旣然說不出爲什麽，那麽，人生不是值不得絲毫留戀了麽？然而事實又不然，每個人都要留戀目已的生活，每個人都希望自已的生命延長。延長下去做什麽呢？又没有人能說得一個理由來。</p>
<p>李白蘇軾一流的厭世詩人於是說：「人生不過是夢而已，没有意義的，享樂罷，盡情地在夢境裏陶醉自已罷！」但是、旣然以爲人生是夢幻，是騙人的虚僞，那又爲什麽要戀夢中的陶醉呢？爲什麽不率性自殺了，免得醉生夢死没有意義呢？這是享樂主義者的矛盾，他們自已也解答不子的。</p>
<p>觀念論的哲學家又說，人生是有意義的，人應該拘着一個最高的道德的理想去生活，應該爲着這理想而努力，爲着這理想而犧牲。生命並不要緊，要緊的是道德理想，但如果我們又追跟究底地一問：是的，假定人生爲着這道德的理想而來，但爲什麽我們一定要爲着理想而來呢？人人都是一樣的生，一樣的死，有理想的人不見得就多活幾十年，没有理想的人也不見得就活不下去，爲什麽一定要有理想呢？没有理想爲什麽不可以呢？這也是不能解答的矛盾。</p>
<p>所以，空空洞洞地談人生，是不會有什麽結果的，我們必須在具體的事實上去找人生的意義。</p>
<p>就事實來說，一個人在世界上，第一個重要的條件就是他生出來時所處的社會。每一個人都是生在一定的社會裏，誰也不會生活在天空中。社會先於個人，因此個人的生活行動，一切都是被社會情况所規定。封建社會裏有對建社會生活的特徵，資本主義社會裏的人也有他們自已的特殊的生活。而在這兩種社會裏，又因爲地位財産的不同而將人分爲種種不同的階層，每一階層的人又各有每一階層自已的生活。</p>
<p>各社會及各階層旣各有其特殊的生活，而這各種特殊的生活又形成了各種特殊的思想，例如封建社會裏的貴族君王等，是有着一種特别優越的權利，而他們的生活也是建築在這優越的權利上的，所以他們就希望人民尊重他們的這種特權，由此發生了特權的思想及忠君的思想，在他們看來，忠君的義務是比生命還重要的，忠義的思想就是封建秩序中的典型的人生觀。又如在資本主資社會裏，資本家們的生活是建築在資本和財産上關係的，因此資本和財物就被他們特别重視，他們認爲資本和財産是比封建的特權重要的，因此在法國革命時候他們就揭起自由平等的旗幟來反對特權制度。他們的生活使他們發生了自由平等的思想（自然，他們的這種自由平等是要有財産和資本才能享受的，所以這種自由平等是虚僞的自由平等）。自由平等就成了他們的人生觀。（但這只是指十九世紀前半的資本主義者）。</p>
<p>這樣，我們可以知道，一個人的人生觀，都是受他的社會環境所决定的。前面說的李白蘇軾一流的半厭世半享樂的人生觀，是代表了他們那種封建時代失意的士大夫的生活。如果空空洞洞地問人生是爲什麽，結果就什麽也得不到，但如果着眼在社會上，我們就可以知道一個人生到世界上來，他的目的就是他所依以生存的那社會中所規定的目的，人生爲什麽，解答就在這裏。</p>
<p>但，社會是由人人構成。社會的一切就是人的行爲的總和。個人的行爲雖然在本質上是爲整個的社會的條件所决定，但人决不是完全被動的，在一定的範圍内，仍可以有相對的自由。我們的人生觀大體上雖然也是社會的産物，但一定的社會裏的人們有各式各樣的階層，有各式各樣的生活，而人生觀也不僅是一種，道裏就有給我們選擇的餘地。我們必須在各種人生觀中選擇最正確的，作爲我們生活的指南針。</p>
<p>選擇的方法，在十年前中國的「科學與人生觀之論戰中」曾有許多學者論辯過，他們中間有一派人是主張用自由意志選擇，主張人生觀没有一定的標凖，這我人當然是不贊成，我們認爲必須找到一種標凖，給我們决定最正確所世界觀。</p>
<p>要有正確的人生觀，必須先對於社會有正確的認識，要對於社會有正確的認識，必須研究社會科學。在這種意味上，我們可以說人生觀應該由科學來决定。</p>
<p>至於間：人生是爲享樂嗎？是爲改造社會嗎？這問題並不是很重要的，只要我們有正確的社會科學的知識，那麽這些問題自然會迎刃而解。</p>

<p>雙打比賽、林寶華鄭兆佳對小寺吉田、原定渡邊因事未出席、林鄭以六比三、六比三、連勝二盤、瞬息即下、小寺尚可、吉田軟弱無能、錯誤尤多、技術相差尚遠、林先開球、對方得勝、小寺開球、林鄭一運得四局、以四比一居先、不費氣力、第五局林發球、以滑局得勝、結果五比二、而六比三、林鄭先勝第一盤、第二盤小寺先開球、發球者皆勝、直至三比三後之第七局、擊破吉田之發球、林鄭遂連勝四局、六比三再得第二盤、</p>

<p>同樣擊法邱飛海與太田、兩人擊法、完全一樣、底綫長抽、來來去去、向兩對角掃射、邱飛海偶爾上網數次、太田昨亦於抽射失敗後、改用上網、奈並不奏效、故兩人宛如牛皮糖一對、全塲不禁閧然失笑也、</p>
<p>老邱傑作　昨日之戰、全爲底綫長抽之對抗、誰能維持其平穩而不慌亂者、得最後勝利、邱飛海此戰、不啻共生平之得意傑作、出球之穩、罕見出界自殺、對角抽深入角底、使太田疲於奔命、太田唯一之利器正手猛抽、昨亦不能得力、邱能回答其各種來球、太田則入後更亂、遂成一蹶不振、</p>
<p>兩個五零昨日兩艦、幾乎同樣形勢、第一盤邱飛海以五比零佔先、第二盤又是五比零同樣局面、老邱聲勢之盛、竟出手意料之外、皆有兩個六比零之可能、邱飛海先發球、底綫對抽、此來彼去、一記可有一二十來回、第一局卒於四次平等之後、爲邱所勝、太田在第一局劇戰後失敗、開始發現其慌張、老邱遂乘勢一連得五局之多、第四局太田雖動怒、而揮其正手猛抽、毫無效果、五比零後、太田背城借一、邱二次以四十十五居先、爲太田所勝、成五比四、第十局太田發球、終不能維持爲邱以六比四得勝、</p>
<p>太田屈服第二盤起、太田精疲力盡、出球已無把握、即最容易之球、亦送人網内、江河日下、不堪收拾、老邱又一而再、再而一、連勝五局、於是勢成甕中作鼈、太田雖竭力奪回二局、最後一局、太田發球邱飛海以滑局得勝、六比二再勝第二盤、</p>

<p>最後一塲單打、卡爾生對小寺、已無復若是之緊張與精彩、小寺爲日本之初級錦標手、年事尚輕、球技尚可、抽球甚穩、對角球與球之落點、使人捉摸不定、第一盤以六比二勝卡爾生、但其後漸現慌張、卡爾生以兩個六比三反勝、</p>

<p>敎部負責人員之談話</p>
<p>近來社會言論、對於中等敎育制度、頗多評論記者因往敎育部探訊部中意見、該部某重要人員、因即發表負責談話、錄之於次、</p>
<p>近來社會態度、和數年以前顯然不同、從前大家對於敎育只是口頭尊重、實際上大家對於敎育經費、學校風氣、學校之成立或停頓、并不重視、近來社會人士對於敎育、確是非常注意、此種現象也許是敎育大改革的預徵、吾人深引爲慰、各方對於現狀之批評或建議、本部同人認爲本部與地方敎育行政當局以及一切從事敎育工作人員、均當悉心考慮、慮懷接納、惟批評者對於現行制度的内容以及其他事實、間或不甚明瞭、兹就各種與中等敎育有關之新近事實、分别說明、庶幾論者對於制度内容以及業經進行之改革計畫、較爲明瞭、一切討論當更爲有益、</p>
<h3 id="c212">（一）中等敎育制度問題 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>前此中等敎育、係採中學·師範職業合併設立制度、初中三年得兼設職業科、高級中學得合設普通師範及職業各科、此種制度、足使各種敎育之設施混淆、目的紛歧其結果中學敎育因無從發展、而師範職業敎育、亦多流於空泛、此已往之陳迹、顯然可考、過去主張合併設立之理、以爲中學併設職業科及師範科、學生通轉較易、適於發展個性、所謂縱横活動之制、但按諸實際、職業技能旣未充分培養、師範敎育亦未有專業訓練、馴至程度日益低落、其結果使謀生·任敎·升學三者之目的、均不能達、本部鑒於上項事實、近已將師範及職業敎育、完全劃出中學範圍之外、使普通中學、師範學校、職業學校各個單獨設立、確定目的、嚴格訓練、以普通中學爲繼續小學訓練、並爲研究高深學術之階梯、師範學校爲培養小學健全師資、施以專業訓練、職業學校、爲培養青年生活之技能、使其能自立生産、如此則普通中學之完整目的、得以貫澈、而職業師範所負之使命、得以完成、故就現制言、所謂中等敎育、實包含中學·師範·職業三種分别設立之學校、</p>
<h3 id="c213">（二）中等敎育經費支配問題 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>查年來中等敎育狀况、普通中學異常發達、而職業與師範敎育均少進展尤以職業敎育爲甚、此爲近來中等敎育之重大病症、社會之責難、半由於此、本部之改革中等敎育近來亦集中於此點、據民國十九年度中等敎育統計、普通中學之校數、約佔中等學校總數三分之二、經費約佔四分之三、學生數超過四分之三、而職業學校校數不及十分之一、經費數僅及十分之一、學生不及百分之七、即此少數職業學校、其内容設備、亦大都因陋就簡、此種中等敎育之畸形發展、在小學固感健全師資之缺乏、其爲家境或學力所限、不能升學之中學畢業生、因普通中學（其主要目的爲升學之預備訓練）缺乏生産技能之訓練、又不能從事職業、長此以往、不僅整個中等敎育體系、將歸失敗、即當前最嚴重之社會問題、亦必與日俱增、本部旣將三種中等學校均以獨立設置爲原則、復鑒於上述嚴重情形、對於中等敎育發展之動向、自不能不予以矯正、因此去年秋問於調查各省市實際情形之後、即訂定各省市中等學校設置及經費支配標凖、以期矯正過去之畸形發展、其所定設置經費分配標凖、各省市職業學校經費、不得低於中等敎育經費總預算數百分之三十五、師範學校不得低於百分之二十五、中學以佔百分之四十爲度、並限定各省市須於二十三年年度開始前依照此項原則、改定敎育預算、成立擬定分年實施具體方案、並限於二十六年度以前完全達到上述標凖、並限定二十三年度後之新增經費、應儘先充作職業及師範敎育經費、其有未能增加者、應就原有經費逐年縮减中學經費之相當額數、以供擴充職業敎育及師範敎育之用、但縮减中學校數、仍須顧及全境中學敎育之平均發展及其辦理成績、現在各省市業已遵照部令辦理斟酌該省預算情形、確定分年改革方案者、計有鄂·贛·粤·皖·豫·閩·浙·蜀·滇·綏·寗夏·威海衛·察哈爾·北平市等省市、他如冀·湘·陜·晋·蘇·魯·甘·上海·青島等省市、亦已擬送方案、經本部指令修正、不日亦可完成、此種改革倘獲完成、則今後中等敎育、當可改變其畸形狀態、生産敎育之目的、當可部分的實現、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c222">蠶業統制之前途 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 徐漢臣</p>
<p>構成蠶業危機的基本形態，第一是繭價濫賤如泥，超過了農民無償勞働所能容忍的限度；第二是經濟能力的薄弱，决定了農民祇有絶望地放棄了改良種的飼育，而以土種來代替；第三，農民捨去了或是减少了蠶的　育，以致桑田迅速地被毁，而改種其他作物。這種趨勢，在本年春季繭市結束的過程中，作更有力的推進。繅絲工業根本的絶减，農業恐慌以多種形態加速展開：就是在這種交互的基本威脅之前，蘇浙諸省農村的主要副業丨蠶業，其前途眞是摇摇欲墜，不可終日！</p>
<p>政府爲了挽救這種頽勢，早已付以甚大的注意。譬如全國經濟委員會專設蠶絲統制委員會、就是爲了擔負此種使命。其他如浙江，在管理改良蠶桑事業委員會這種機關之下，默默地行那統制政策，已非一年；江蘇自今春以來，也在建設廳的領導之下，組織蠶業改良委員會，對於統制全省蠶絲事業，曾作猛烈的活躍。到了財實兩部會同江浙兩省議訂挽救蠶絲業計劃，其辦法又有比較具體的規定了。除了奬勵植桑，改良桑園，改進技術等比較次要的以外，牠底主要方向是在繭行統制與蠶種統制兩大目標下進行。統制政策之成爲政府解救目前蠶業危機的基本方案，已是無容疑的事件了。</p>
<p>在財實二部會呈行政院的計劃書中，有改良收繭辦法的擬議，其目的在使農民解脫了高利貸及商業資本家底中間層的剥削，而以「農民絲廠直接貿易爲原則」。但是實際上統制繭行顯然不是由這樣「原則」出發，牠底動因是或多或少地與當前的財政危機有其淵源關係；所以江蘇建設廳所規定的統制法，其重心就自然地移到「强令收繭者每擔繳納保證金三元」（第六條），以及「每收乾繭一擔，當繳改良費十二元」（第八條）這類條文上來了！這類純爲增加稅收的統制法，對於挽救蠶業危機的關係，實使人無從捉摸！</p>
<p>另一方面，江蘇省蠶業改進委員會第五屆大會，爲了鎭壓繭行們反抗統制，通過了十三條「嚴厲取締」的辦法。其中第四條是「凡收繭商所塡收繭日報表，如有以多報少者，將其短報部份之繭，没收充公」；第五條是「凡收繭商所收之繭，未經塡送乾繭起運請求書，報請發給乾繭納費證及乾繭通行執照，而擅自起運者，將其無證照起運部份没收充公」。這種辦法，很明顯地都在如何防範商人規避繳費，這一點上設想，所以也在暗示出所謂繭行統制的具體内容，實不是要徵收一種變相的稅捐在該辦法第九條中，又規定「凡以模範改良區産繭冒充普通區産繭，希圖免納改進蠶桑事業費者，將該繭全部没收充公」，這樣所謂模範改良區所産之繭，其所以異於普通區者，實不過牠是多繳納了一重費用，於是，在政府劃區積極推行蠶桑業挽救辦法的潮流中，乃有江隂縣絲繭商向實部及農村復興委員會通電反對該縣劃爲改良區要求確認爲普通區的離奇現象，現行繭行統制政策下的暗影，實是頗堪心悸的了！</p>
<p>事實上，政府與收繭商人之間，在意見上並没有多大的距離；商人除了因爲該項政策增高稅率而外，他不需要再說什麽，更不需要來反對統制。所以，今年春季江蘇反抗繭行統制辦法閙得滿城風雨的當兒，因政府接受了「每乾繭一擔，繳改進費三元」等三項辦法而迅速地解决了。但是，除了巨大的稅欵新收入以外，繭行統制究竟曾否减輕農民所受商業資本家的種種壟斷和播弄，或是使繅絲廠家能够不由「繭商從中周轉賣買」，而降低其「繭本」，實是我們不應忽視的問題。</p>
<p>在本年春季的蠶繭市塲上，農民依然或是更甚地受到收繭商人對於繭價壟斷的剥削。無錫江隂紹興蕭山海寗等地的繭行同業公會，遠在開秤收繭之前，便决定繭的最高價，牠們都或多或少地對繭市塲發生影響。金壇縣爲了實行繭行統制，使二十七家繭行歸併成四家，皆爲大商人所壟斷，得以任意殺價；結果使農民大衆起而反抗，激成流血風潮。同樣的事實，也在蕭山重現了（見六月間每日新聞）。商業資木家底剥削機能，並不曾因爲繭行統制之雷厲風行，而感受何種影響。商人在向農民轉嫁其所繳納的改良費的過程中，自然更需促進壟斷殺價的機能，這樣，繭行統制是成爲遠離農民大衆的政策了；農民除了忍痛地比市塲價格更低廉地出賣其蠶繭外，只得晒繭土繅，毫無保障地希望絲市回漲來解救他們了！</p>
<p>政府對於繭的販賣市塲所施行的繭行統制政策，牠有多大能力來挽救蠶業恐慌，我們已不難由其很本動向及其實際事態推論而得。</p>
<p>當然，在政府挽救蠶桑業的整個體系中，其主要目標，是放置在蠶繭的生産過程中，以求根本的解放。改良蠶種算是入手的第一步，而蠶種統制乃是實施的具體手段。然其結果又怎樣呢？</p>
<p>整個農村的極度貿困，繭價狂瀉似地低賤，使農民無從夢想育蠶過程的改良。貧困促使他們熱望，繭的豐收，而同時又在根本毁滅他們的希望。江浙間一般農的，迅速地復育土種，爲的是他們没有現金可以購買高價的改良蠶種。這種情形，在本年春季改良種生産過剩上，可以看出來。不但蘇省蠶種多餘了二三十萬，就是實行統制的浙省，也多八萬張，無法銷售。蠶種統制在或種程度上固能强迫人民飼育改良種，但是牠克服不了農民的貧困，這是問題的核心呀！</p>
<p>目下，江蘇省在積極進行蠶種統制，頒佈統制辦法八條，决自二十三年秋季起實行在模範改良區中，其主要辦法是（一）各蠶户所需蠶種張數，秋種於六月三十日前，春種於十月三十一日前，塡表呈報；（二）秋種種欵於當年七月二十日以前，春種種欵於上年十二月三十一日彚解；（三）前項種欵解到後，即按照所解種價，配給蠶種，但各蠶户領種數量，不得超過預報下量，過期亦不得請領。另外最主要的是統一種價，每張一律五角。按照今年春季無錫種價，其最好者如大有種塲出品之虎牌種，已跌價至七角，至壽星等牌，每張僅售四角，那末現在農民能從蠶種統制中，得到多少種價的優待呢？在上述三項售種辦法中，政府在辦事進行上，確是非常便當，旣不必負種價拖欠的危險，又無蠶種生産與消售間不一致的弊病。但天數不會有對立的雙方同時便利的，政府爲了能便利地進行其所謂統制，在農民却轉變爲意外責任的加重在絲的市塲價格極度動摇的威脅之下，秋季的育蠶量，農民在六月三十日以前，已經不得不决定；甚至到次年三月間才開始育養的蠶量，現在非在前一年的十月决定不可。姑不論農民究竟有没有能力作這樣的决定，而第三項辦法，又逼使他們非盲目地規定不可；否則，他們再也没有蠶種可以領得了。農民在這老長期間，需負担多育或少育的一切損失。尤其是第二項辦法，關於預先限繳種欵的規定，這簡直是使農民無法接受統制蠶種的好意了，在距領到蠶種的數月之前，農民已經必須將種欵繳付。道樣，在整個農業恐慌中陷於極度貧困的農民，不是更受壓迫，因而更深地墮入高利貨者的掌握之中，便是被强迫地放棄繼續育蠶的機會。秋蠶育養一開始之後，事實便會詔告我們。</p>
<p>對於一般普通區内，蘇省公賣蠶種，其定價每張要高一角（即六角），（見該統制條文第四條乙項第二欵）。此外還有所謂特殊情形的改良區，其售價每張要加二角，即爲七角（同上丙項）。這種模範區與普通區之間公賣價格的不同，顯然的是爲了政府曾經在模範區裏面徵收了巨額的改良制之故。徵收改良費與蠶種公賣間的血統關係便是如此！</p>
<p>農民是分散的，他們只是默默地用事實來答覆。但是蠶種統制所加於商人的負担，他們便不甘緘默地來接受。在六月裏，江蘇省府對於秋種收買的辦法是：「行銷蘇省，每張七角五分，先付五角，共需欵三十二萬元，餘二角五分，俟出繭在繭價中抽補。此三十二萬元，春季繭捐中可撥十六萬元，餘由財廳籌撥一（見六月二十四日大晚報）；但是最近，「蘇省蠶業改進會，爲顧全事實起見，重行變更辦法，爲每張先付一角半」（見八月七日中華日報），這便引起無錫蘇州武進蠶種業公會幾次開會反對，以爲「省方規定，顯與最初功令相反」，而堅决地要求「取消輸出外省銷售之成命，並要求先付種欵每張五角五分，否則拒絶浸酸」。請願結果，負責當局答覆：「關於種價，廳方規定，先給五角，除一角五分，已付各塲外，其餘二角五分，須視秋繭成績，再行補發」（均見上報）。目下三縣代表還繼續在向省方請願中。可是這樣一來，政府旣然不必從「春季繭捐中撥十八萬元」，更不必要對廳塡付十四萬元了。但是農民爲了獲得秋種，早在七月二十日以前，已不得不以每張五角的代價，將種欵繳付給「蠶業改進管理委員會」了！</p>
<p>蠶業是不得不救濟的，政府除了增植桑樹或是改進技術等辦法還是停留在計劃書上以外，繭行統制與蠶種統制已在猛烈推行，然其前途已如上述。所以蠶業危機的解救，還是中國農民大衆本身底一個踝題！八·十一·</p>

<p>— 夏道湘</p>
<p>丨紐約商品交易所華絲掛牌問題之研究丨</p>
<p>近年來華絲外銷阻滯、繭絲市價，時復跌落到生産成本以下，農民栽桑養蠶，無利可圖，故有掘起桑樹，改種他種植物，以致産繭量連年减少，其他製種塲，絲廠亦復因營業虧折，先後宣告停業倒閉者，不計其數。江浙粤等處工人失業，殆以萬計，整個蠶絲業呈衰落不堪現象，雖有中央及地方政府力謀挽救，終以世界經濟情勢所趨，及國内當業者之能力薄弱，一時難有若何之挽回。正當全國蠶絲界人士同聲嗟歎之際，忽於五月間，有世界銷絲最多之美國，其紐約商品交易所，擬將華絲及意大利絲掛牌，並准華意絲代替日絲行交貨之消息傳來，此實促進華絲對美銷售之先聲也。</p>
<p>試究此事之動機及其推進之經過，雖係美國之自身關係，若無他方之推動，又焉能至此哉，究竟吾人有無推動之力，不可不研究華絲國際貿易最近之情勢。</p>
<p>華絲輸出貿易向操諸洋商之手，上海方面，前雖有虎林，緯成，景星，通運等數華商出而經營，均因虧折而先後宣告停業，所存者僅通運一家而已。最近無錫永泰絲廠，雖時派人員赴美接洽銷絲，亦僅爲自身産絲着想。如此能力薄弱之輸出者，焉有推動宣傳之力，加之華絲對美輸出，品質旣感馭雜，而數量又年見减少，兹依美國綢業恊會及吾華海關所載數目，列表於后，以資佐證：</p>

<p>（附註）海關所報告數目，與美國綢業恊會所調查者略有出入，想係華絲出口輾轉而到美者爲數不少。</p>
<p>由上表觀之，華絲輸美，爲數年僅數萬包，而其種類有黃白廠絲，黃白經絲及灰絲多種。且最近二十一年以後，由六七萬包减到二萬餘包之出口，其原因雖說受經濟衰落及人造絲影響，安知不是華絲品質不佳，有以致之！如此量微質雜之華絲，又安能引起美國絲業界之同情而有所提携！</p>
<p>然則此事推進原動力何在？在以吾意測之，係在意大利，何以見之？該國自莫索里尼首相執政，厲行振興農村，改善貿易，奬勵蠶業政策以來，生絲産額，年見增加，由四百餘萬磅增到一千萬磅以上。最近更行應急救濟政策，對於生絲生産者以一千克鮮繭給以三里那義金之奬勵。更於生絲輸出，謀國際管理，由歐洲各國聯合，阻止東亞生絲（日本絲）之輸入，以期意，法産絲消費之增大。同時對於意絲輸美，從事種種宣傳及實地改進，遂由二千七百包驟增至一萬九千包，增加七倍以上。兹以最近意絲輸美數額，記之於后：</p>

<p>由前觀之，意大利産量及其輸美數額，以意大利本身先後比較，固有長足之進步，然以美國生絲市塲觀之，意絲僅占百分之三以下之極微地位，又焉能引起美國絲業界之注意而有所推動？吾意此事推動最大原力，一方在意大利之國際宣傳，同時操縱世界及美國生絲貿易全權之意商乾利氏等居中推動之力居多，以致有此結果，華商不過受其餘蔭而已。</p>
<p>美國紐約商品交易所雖受意大利國際宣傳及乾利等意商之推進，而於本身亦歷感日絲獨占美國市塲，操縱市價，故有提倡華，意生絲，以期牽制而謀打破獨占局面，以求市塲之穩定。兹以美國綢業恊會調查所得，美國消費各國生絲列表於後，以資佐證：</p>

<p>由上表觀之，美國年銷生絲五十萬担左右。其中百分之八十五以上爲日本絲，歐洲絲僅占百分之三以下，華絲占百分之十二以下，是美國生絲市塲爲日本獨占，市價被其操縱，不言而喻。故美國時有促進華意生絲，以期制服日絲而求市塲穩定，免受日本欺壓；同時美國經營華意生絲輸入商，亦從旁相助，以期獲得相當利益。日本蠶絲業當局接到美國紐約商品交貨所生絲部，擬將華意絲掛牌；同時爲日絲交貨代用消息，以爲影響日絲對美輸出甚大，故中央蠶絲會評議議，特爲此事於六月間開會討論，結果：認爲日本生絲之買賣，以意大利絲及華絲爲交貨之代用品，殊令交易錯雜，且有缺乏交貨適當之虞，此意用電報通知紐約商品交易所，請其深切考慮，同時日本生絲輸出商，水向美國方面宣傳華意生絲每年供給美國不過四五萬包，且其品質馭雜，若爲其掛牌，徒引起買空賣空之投機結果，絲價殆起無味之變動，不但日本蠶絲業受影響，即美國消費者亦感不利。紐約商品交易所，因此將華意絲交貨代用一案，將付本年九月六日所開生絲會員討論會之討論後，方行决定。</p>
<p>紐約商品交易所縱令華絲掛牌並准爲交貨代用，而吾華絲能否即時對美輸出增加，尚在未定之天。不過意大利推進促成美國准備舉行之際，而日本以種種論調阻撓，雖係國際商業競爭所必然，然吾人處此，不可不有以善其後。兹就管窺所及，略書於左，以供關心絲業者之探討：</p>
<p>第一，與意大利合作推進感於意大利人之推動於前，國人應共同恊力　其合作進行，以期華意絲在美掛牌交貨代用問題之實現；第二，對美國宣傳在九月六日紐約商品交易所生絲部會員討論會以前，吾國蠶絲界人士，應對華絲掛牌及交貨代用一節；在美國作種種文字及實地宣傳，以免受人中傷；第三，管理華絲輸美，並組織健全機關過去華絲輸美，不但無管理節制，即華商之直接經營輸出者，亦只上海通運及無錫永泰絲廠之個人推銷而已，其餘大部份均由洋商經手辦理，以致發生種種流弊，此次受日方指摘華絲品質馭雜，不能爲交貨代用，並其爲數甚微，若掛牌後徒引起買空賣空之投機，而致絲價時現高低等宣傳，吾人應請蠶絲界人士，細心體察研究並實行所以改善之道。其根本辦法，余屢作文以述之，如提高統一華絲品質，减低華絲成本，穩定華絲市價等。不過目前蠶絲業現况，尚難至此，惟有對華絲輸美施行管理統制，並由官商合作組織對美輸出健全機關之、　耳，其辦法原則暫擬如下：</p>
<p>Ａ華絲輸美之前，無論華商洋商經手販賣，均須經上海商品檢騐局照美國襪廠綢廠等需要標凖，嚴厲檢騐及格後方准輸出：</p>
<p>Ｂ國内預備輸美生絲，最好全部由該機關經手，以期售出之絲，其品質滿足美國需要者心理，同時對於美國市塲，决謀華絲市價穩定，不要時現高低，會圖小利，引起美人不良印象；</p>
<p>Ｃ該機關經手之絲，或係經售，或係購買轉賣，品質均須在標凖Ｄ格以上，可以代替日絲行交貨，並其購入原價不能過高，以便與日絲競銷，</p>
<p>以上所見，不敢自認適當，但機遇在前，還請蠶絲業者急起直追，作共同之奮鬥焉。</p>

<p>無奈不論全世界上那一個老資格的司機，要他在開車時絶對不使車輛震動，怕是一椿永遠没有的事情吧！至少限度，目前在這裏替我們開駛這一列御用火車的司機，他就没有這樣好的本領！</p>
<p>開車的命令下去了，火車便正式開始行動起來：這時候，我們大家都端端正正地站立在那一間小朝廷裏。太后一個人高坐在御座上，滿臉堆着笑，正待好好地領略伊初次乘坐火車的滋味；不料整列的火車，猛可裏望後一退，又猛可裏往前一衝，震得我們幾個人都幾乎突然翻倒，而同時車壁上那些小木架上所擱的許多最爲太后所愛好的古玩玉器，已因受不住這一震而紛紛地掉下來了。這樣一來，可眞把我嚇得魂飛天外了！一個苦力似的司機夫，竟敢大胆把太后所心愛的東西震落到地上來，他還能不受一番嚴厲的懲處嗎？我想其時在皇太后的心上，或者確然有這種思想。不管伊究竟有没有這衝思想，但是我們却也不能再照顧那司機夫了，我們還是趕快照顧照顧自已吧！因爲這一列火車上的佈置，差不多全是我和慶善兩個人所主辦的，例是在東壁上另裝這些小木架，以備太后安放伊的古玩玉器的主意，也是我們所定下的；如今北京城還没有出，光是火車第一個行動，這些東西已全弔下來了，要如火車再往前行去，以後的把戲還能說没有嗎？我想這些人的中間，一定有人要犧牲他的腦袋了！當然，我自已也不敢確信進個挨刀的人，决不是我，也許竟然是我！誰敢保得？何况當我在簇擁太后出宫上轎之前，我還很得意地在伊面前誇讚過那火車上的佈置怎樣周到，一切陳設，安排得怎樣妥貼，那知隔不到兩個時辰，便得到了這樣一個矛盾的反證。讀者試想：太后對於我，還能有什麽好感嗎？（一○三）</p>

<p>我前天到滬，在一位朋友家裏，見著一件很能使人感想，而足以發抒今昔變遷時代滄桑的太息。這位朋友，在三十年前，他還在童年的時候，正是公子哥兒，錦衣玉食，坐在書房裏，讀不到一兩小時，就算功課已畢，隨他的爸爸，坐馬車吃大菜去了。後來，他遭著大故，年紀雖小，到也能繼承家業，把所有的資産，謹謹守著，所以人家都稱他是一個少年老成，克家的令子；現在呢？莫說他的家道中落，他的境遇，也遠不像以前的光景。不過當時，我在這位朋友家裏，未曾見面的當兒、他在樓上喚一聲：「新來個，你！倒盃茶去，請客人坐罷。」誰料捧了茶，走出的，偏是白髮如銀，垂老龍鍾的一個老嫗，并且伊還認識，能够呌我×先生，於是我倒有些驚異起來。起初，以爲上海人家，僱了女傭，總是呌著「娘姨，」或者呌「張家哩，」「王家哩」的就算有呌「新來個，」决不會有這樣大的年紀，住了幾十年的道理。「咦！」伊對我暗暗地說：「×先生，你曉得，×少爺，在那一年春天，做交易所，虧去若干萬，又在那一年冬裏，做金子生意，也虧去若干萬，最後，又因地産的糾葛，還吃了一塲官司，×先生這眞是老東家當時想不到的呢」！說罷，伊兩眼裏的涙珠兒，像串一般的滾下來。我聽了這一番的話，也不由得心中忽然地酸楚，我問伊：「你！今年幾歲了。」伊說：「我已七十三歲了，我來時，還只得三十多歲，×少爺，正在他母親的肚裏，現在×少爺的兒子，也已經二十歲，娶親生子了。我問伊：「你！實在不是新來個，是舊來個。」伊癟著嘴，笑了一笑，遂進去了。</p>
<p>歇了一回，朋友從樓上下來，我因爲聽了老嫗的話，一見了面，比較起先來的意思，也就從眼前的環境，和口頭的攀談，很覺難以措辭，末了，就寒暄了一遍，說：「今天順道趨候，過一日，寗到府細談罷。」出了門，想這老嫗的話，却像白頭宫女，談著開天遺事、故　這篇，當伊的傳文。</p>
<h3 id="c231">測量瑣談 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>中國領土究有多少方里？這問題，要是根據歷祖歷宗遺傳下來的中古紀錄來解决的話，正如中國人口老是「四萬萬」同樣地「毛估毛斷」，有欠準確國人每以國土日削爲慮，但自已的國土究有多少，縱使地理專家，怕也回不出個精確解答。說來眞覺慚愧！</p>
<p>照例，中國的測量工程，僅用在造路濬河方面。測勘國界是多麽麻煩而不切實用！所以，假使旁的國家，不侵佔中國的土地，我們是轉不到測勘國界的念頭的！因此本文的「瑣談」僅以測勘路綫爲限。</p>
<p>造路的初步工程是測量。路綫測定之後，着手購買民地，然後才得動工，其間演出的笑話是很多的。</p>
<p>鄕下人見到一批人帶着「千里鏡」「皮帶尺」在他們田地上「東張西望」「量來量去」，他們下意識的知道這是什麽回事。不管這批人是在實習測量，或是眞在計畫築路；他們老是帶着惶恐的聲調喊着「來造路了」！大有相驚伯有之概！</p>
<p>標記路綫的東西是一條條打在地上的木樁。鄕下人爲了他們的田地可以避免「圈買」的緣故，强梁的就在夜間毁掉了這批木樁，厚善的偷偷地把木樁移到旁的地方去，大有「推死屍過界」意味，因此對於測量工程方面，很多限碍。</p>
<p>我們在報紙上常見鄕下人毆打測量員焚燒測量儀器的新聞，但在「毆打」「焚燒」之前，他　還有縱出許多條惡狗來嚇退測量員的把戲，眞是冥頑可笑！</p>
<p>這僅指民風純良的江浙數省而言在皖陜多匪之區，據說，隴海鐵路着手測量的時候，武裝實彈的衛兵多過測量人員好幾倍。在中國想幹些「開發」事業，竟有出於意外的困難。民風閉塞，誠足慨歎！</p>

<p>誠然，紅的舞女果正是生意興隆通四海，可是伊們痛苦的低層却超過了手篋兒里的舞票呢！</p>
<p>祇使在要哭的時候，也只得含著笑撒著嬌，博得客人的歡心。薄薄的細紗的旗衫像游泳池里上了岸一樣地淋漓。含有鉛質的化妝品儘管搽著，一層復一層的。深夜啦！腿兒一軟一軟地没力啦！爲了要求得客人的滿足，於是祗有抽著烟，吸著酒，好使尼可丁和酒精交戰著提起些頽廢了的精神。可是客人呢？跟著自鳴鐘的動力一樣的没有停减，也許反而格外的起勁了。本來，他們是來享樂的！當然囉！尚有更多的慘痛的悲鳴在隱著哩！</p>

<p>是的，顧繡的精緻，是不愧爲全國之冠。清代南洋勸業會裏的一幅意國皇太后像，爲蘇州余沈壽女士手製，價值三千鎊，直到現在，還傳爲美談。</p>
<p>可是，說剌繡，也罷了，爲什麽定要說顧繡呢？</p>
<p>原來，這有一段值得提起的掌故。</p>
<p>在明代時，有上海巨紳顧會海，於縣城西北九畝地，築露香園一所。其姬人侍婢，對於剌繡一事，特别擅長。山水人物，翖毛花卉，無不着手如生。作品俱甚名貴。</p>
<p>有「八駿圖」一幅，據云，見者都誇爲「雖子昻用筆，不能辦」。又有「尊者圖」一幅（卽佛像）曾爲人作詩爲贊，稱：「女郎繡佛人天喜，運針如筆綾如紙，華亭顧婦嗟神工，盤絲劈綫資纖指」云云。</p>
<p>其「停針圖」一幅，還有一段小小的來歷。</p>
<p>話說有一天，露香園裏，聚集着許多貴客，談話中提起顧繡，都十分贊美。只有一個姓金的老儒生不以爲然，說道：</p>
<p>一繡工雖好，却不需要。從前，錢文通好着新衣，穿了大紅雲布做的官裝去朝見皇上。於是，朝廷才曉得松江産布，旨令按年解京供奉，至今遺害地方。君家何不從事紡織，使得來客到門，只聽得軋軋的織機聲，豈不比現在君家内眷們一日到夜的剌繡，那停針不語的神情模樣，來得有意義？」</p>
<p>當時，顧會海聽了，便斜着頭和别人笑道：</p>
<p>「不要說此君老學究啊！他措詞雖然率眞，却十分嫵媚的呢？」</p>
<p>第二天，就呌人繡「停針圖」。完工後，畫態極妍，而綫絲接合處，了無痕跡。上海全城的人，都一窩蜂似的來看。此幅估價，值三百金。後來，被一個揚州富商以漢玉連環和周昉美人圖到顧家來，請求交換，拿了去。</p>
<p>那時，顧繡之名，全國各地，幾乎「家喻户曉。」後來閨閣中的繡品，初則都冒充顧氏，繼稱仿製。現在雖已失傳，但顧繡名字，在剌繡業中，已十分典型化而通俗化了。</p>

<p>裸腿問題　這幾天來，婦女的裸腿，因北平市長袁良的厲行禁止，已引起了男女兩界的爭辯。在蘇州方面關於婦女裸腿問題，也是熱閙異常；先之以黨員周松綸的呈請取締，繼之以潘瑛女士上書吳縣長，呐喊不平，終之以公安王局長指令各巡官，如發現裸腿女子，勸導不服，可以拘局處罰。在這呈文迭上訓令交下的當兒蘇地報紙上面，當然也點綴得十分熱閙，報紙副刊，出着特刊，大小各報，各有妙文，眞是公有公理，婆有婆理。平心而論摩登女子健美的肉腿，光緻緻肥膩膩的裸在外面，用藝術的眼光瞧去，確乎欣賞不厭，動人情感，很合「女爲悅已者容」的條件。至於風凉和經濟的話　簡實是欺人之談，摩登的小姐們，身上裸了緊緊的旗袍，外加還要禦絲肩巾，或披薄大衣祇裸出兩條腿，也風凉不到那裏？經濟更談不到了，足指甲旣抹了蔲丹，大腿上又塗着香膏，一次化裝，所費不資，祇須一瞧六個月的脂粉進口價目，竟達八十五萬二千餘元，那裏又談得到什麽經濟！蘇州禁止裸腿的禁令公布後，裸腿固有少了不少，然而一班倔强的女郎，依然將兩腿光緻緻地裸着，在公園裏面，我們還有欣賞的機會，好在禁令雖嚴，警士們却眼開眼閉，聽那輩姑娘們的自由！</p>
<p>賽會問題　因着求雨的緣故，由鄕下人舉行的小白龍出巡，掉龍燈的玩意，引出了金鑼鏜鏜，皂隸對對，魚龍曼衍，儀伏全套的迎神賽會。這種賽會，起先因當局的瞧做「其愚雖不可及，其誠却實可敬，」採取放任主義；於是一班在佛面上肯犧牲的善男信女，頓時一窩蜂全體動員，有錢者出錢，有力者出力，在炎炎毒日下面奔走。在上月的蘇州，簡實成了神道世界，賽會每天至少兩起，儀仗中的臂鑼臂香，也由十餘人激增至二三百人；並且所掛的物件，也逐日變化，甚至乳部掛了西瓜，上身穿着絨球，奇形怪狀，愈演愈奇，於是黨部出了勸告，縣府下着訓令，然而禁者自禁，出者自出，直到縣長親諭公安局，巡官去職，會首解局，這賽會的熱良，才告平自。然而蘇州民衆，對於當局處置賽會的態度，前寛後嚴，還在紛紛作爲茶餘酒後討論的問題。</p>

<h3 id="c237">醫事建設方略（上） <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>歷年以來。醫事改進之呼聲。甚囂塵上。顧所以改進之者。究有具體之方法否耶。夫欲醫學之進展。則一切足以助長醫學之發達者。皆當提倡而力行之一切足以阻礙醫學之發達者。皆當打倒而剷除之。蓋我國今日之醫學。如初生之苗。非潤以時雨。溉以肥料。不足以助其滋生。非去其害蟲。薙其叢莠。不足以盡其發育。用是不揣淺陋。擬具大綱。顔之曰醫事建設方略。</p>
<p>（一）醫育方面　浚流者必先治源。植木者必先固本。治天下者必先致力於敎育。醫事建設。何獨不然。故首言醫育。</p>
<p>（甲）製訂醫學課程標準改進不良醫校　國内醫校雖有二十六。而其課程眞能稱爲合理化者殊尠。蓋課程設備之完簡。相懸萬殊。於是畢業之學生。其程度亦懸若天壞。良由所受敎育之不齊。故不能收一致之效也。夫射者必有鵠而後知所趨。行者必有方而後知所赴。未有無目的無樣準而能政行民聽者也。職是之故。醫學課程標準之製訂。實爲當前急務。現在政府旣有醫學課程標準委員會之組織。而具體之醫校課程標準。已在擬訂之中。此吾輩之所引領而望其早日實施者也。</p>
<p>（乙）學理與經騐并重增長實習時間　醫育課程之製訂。旣如上述。惟將以何者爲標準乎。曰。臨床醫學與基礎醫學二者并重而已。蓋醫學爲實用之科學。必有實騐與實習。國内學校。大抵敎室讀書之時間多。醫院實習之時間少。學生畢業之後。懸壺問問世。往往學理雖深。經騐不足。又其下者。至以病人爲試騐。此甚危險之事。今若增長其實習之時間至三年以上。使其於學生時代。卽已具有豐富之經騐。則出而問世。自可游刃有餘。而决無以病人爲試騐之事矣。</p>
<p>（丙）增設醫師倫理學一科以爲良醫之訓練　傳曰「不爲良相。則爲良醫。」醫而曰良。固由於其學識之過人。更由於其人格之皎皎。此國内醫校於醫師倫理畢一科。所以必需增設也。蓋醫師爲職業之一種。其對於國家。社會。病人。同道。皆有其特殊之立塲。其應守之倫理。自非普通倫理所可包括。若不於讀書時代。養成其良好之人格。則開業以後。自難免非道違義之事。年來醫事糾紛。層出疊見。而同道之問尤多非道義之競爭。於此足見醫者　於自守之道處世之方均無相當之修養。若能增設醫師倫理學一科。以爲良醫之訓練。則數年以後。所謂醫事糾紛者。無形中自可减少矣。</p>
<p>（丁）各省增設合於標準之醫校以增加正式新醫之産生　近之言醫育者。有重質重量之說。重質者主張提高醫育程度。而不必多設醫校。重量者則以國内新醫不敷分配。非多設醫校。不足以大量的産生新醫。吾以爲二者之說。可以互用。而不可以偏廢。所謂國内新醫不敷分配者。確爲事實。而欲增設醫校以産生大量之新醫者。尤爲當前之急務。顧吾人於此。一方固須增加醫校之數量。一方尤須考究醫校之内。務使所增者咸合於醫學課程之標凖。然後所産生者。乃能爲正式之新醫。不然。祇求其多。不問其質。粗製濫造。滿地皆江湖之醫。此孔子所謂「雖多亦奚以爲」也。</p>
<p>（二）醫政方面</p>
<p>醫政者。政府行政之一端。吾國醫政之不修久矣。凡足以興利除害。以保障我醫業之發展者。舉無所聞也。我醫界亦嘗供給政府以施政之方針。與夫實施之材料矣。何政府之未有所表示也。兹不憚煩而再言之。</p>
<h3 id="c238">炎暑常見皮膚病之一丨丨濕疹（下） <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 計濟霖</p>
<p>上述六期。乃濕疹通常所見者。但其經過。非必如此全備。因原因之强弱。發生之緩急。剌激之久暫。個人之素質。發生之部位。而異其經過。或於紅斑期卽告治愈。有初起卽爲丘疹者。有水痀膿疱乾燥後卽治者。其整然自第一期按次至第六期而終止者亦有之。濕疹之經過旣明。兹再述其症候。大别爲二。卽急性與慢性是也。急性濕疹初起之時。皮膚潮紅，腫脹，灼熱，瘙痒，往往有惡寒等輕度身體不快之症狀。小兒甚至發熱。其患部逐漸變爲丘疹與水疱。再復變爲膿疱。形成痂皮。痂皮脫落後成鱗屑而愈。但治療本症。如未去其發生之原因。及一切誘因之加入。則必致復發。終成慢性濕疹。其頑固難治。較急性尤甚。瘙痒亦較劇。往往以搔爬過度。增重炎症。致釀成潰瘍。而患濕疹者以在急性時。卽施以適當治療爲宜。</p>
<p>濕疹發生之部位。以頭部，顔面，手足，頸部，關節屈面，股隂，乳部，等處爲多。其症狀略有差異。兹簡述一二。</p>
<p>（一）頭及顔面濕疹　通常以惡寒起始。而於顔面起潮紅腫脹。且發小丘疹水疱或膿疱。逐漸蔓延於頭髮部。變爲慢性。但起始於頭髮部繼蔓延於顔面者亦有之。以小兒發生爲多。因其皮膚薄弱。易遭外界剌激故也。</p>
<p>（二）手足濕疹　或發於脚趾。形成小數之水疱。或侵入手足全部。起劇甚之腫脹。形成多數水疱者。瘙痒異常。其生於下腿者。多與靜脈瘤合併。往往使皮膚肥厚及浮腫。</p>
<p>（三）隂部濕疹　生於隂囊會隂等處。潮紅濕潤。或有落屑。劇甚時全部浮腫。或蔓延至肛門周圍。</p>
<p>（四）間擦濕疹　肥胖者之頸部或兩股間。又如腋下。乳下，關節屈面，等處。皮膚常自相摩擦。益以汗液之剌激。易生濕疹。且往往自頸部或乳部蔓延於全軀幹者亦有之。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>治療濕疹之法。因其發生經過各期。症候不同。變化靡定。故治療亦因之而異。如在紅班期丘疹期。宜用無剌戟性撒布劑，酒精性洗滌劑，乾燥塗布劑等。單用一種或併用數種療法。須視醫者經騐而定。例如瘙痒難堪之際。先用酒精性洗滌劑。後於同一部使用撒布劑是也。於水疱期膿疱期。應用撒布劑或彩粥。於浸潤期其不被痂皮者。則施以罨法。於濕潤之輕度者。用撒布劑亦可。而濕潤與結痂俱强度之時。則用軟膏且須纒以繃帶。分泌漿液多量時。須時時交換之。顔面濕疹不便繃纒者。則應用膠劑。於鱗屑期則當用白降汞等軟膏。總之。濕疹雖爲常見之皮膚病。然因各期症候之不同。治療時。須先明療法之性質視濕疹之狀態。而選用其適當者。慢性頑固之濕疹。並須行全身療法如注身内服等。尤非經醫者指導。不能冒昧施治。爲患者計。祗有注意</p>
<p>（一）攝生　避免剌激性飲食物之攝肊（如酒醋葱薑等）。并注意大便之便利。</p>
<p>（二）力避外來之剌激　如衣服之摩擦壓迫等。</p>
<p>至治療之法。須請敎醫者。否則。不但貽悮治療之機。且使精神，體力，經濟等方面。均蒙無故之損失也。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（三十五）蚓突炎和盲腸周圍炎</p>
<p>（問）蚓突是什麽東西？</p>
<p>（答）蚓突是大腸起始部的盲腸一端伸出的蚓狀小垂體，從前譯爲蟲樣突起，就是這個。</p>
<p>（問）盲腸是什麽東西？</p>
<p>（答）盲腸就是大腸的起始端，和小腸接連部分的下方垂下成囊狀的部分，但並不和小腸相通。</p>
<p>（問）蚓突炎和盲腸周圍炎是不是一種病？</p>
<p>（答）在解剖上因爲病的部分不同，所以應該算二種病。但在臨症上往往同時發生，症狀又相同，很難分别，所以總是合起來講的。</p>
<p>（問）這種病的原因是什麽？</p>
<p>（答）他們的原因，不外三種。（一）是因爲　　蚓突的構造上的特異，像管腔狹小，黏膜多皺襞，營養血管的是終末動脈，組織又多淋巴腺狀質等，都是誘起發病的要約。（二）因爲便秘，魚骨燒蟲等的侵入，或子宫附屬器的炎症，也是誘因。（三）在傳染疾患的經過中也有誘發的。</p>
<p>（問）蚓突炎和盲腸周圍炎的初發狀的病怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）以急激的腹痛，惡心，（有時發嘔吐）和食慾减退開始。有舌苔，大都便秘。</p>
<p>（問）這種腹病比較尋常的腹痛，有特異之點嗎？</p>
<p>（答）發生蚓突炎時的腹病，最初往往是廣泛性；在二十四小時以内，限局於右下腹部的領域。同時在這個領域之内有壓痛。</p>
<p>（問）右下腹部外部有什麽現象？</p>
<p>（答）右下腹部的腹壁有反射的緊張；呼吸時的活動，比左側輕微。腹壁反射，又往往缺乏。</p>
<p>（問）右腿有異狀嗎？</p>
<p>（答）右側的腿，常取屈曲的姿勢。</p>
<p>（問）病人全身，有没有發熱？</p>
<p>（答）普通發熱到攝氏表三十八度至四十度；但也有不發熱的。</p>
<p>（問）病人脉搏的情形怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）頻數；但輕症時每分鐘不到一百次以上。脉搏數愈增，可以說是病勢愈兇。</p>
<p>（問）這種病的經過，大概要幾天？</p>
<p>（答）輕症的時候，只消數天，已有治愈的。又有日後反復發作的。也有成爲盲腸周圍膿瘍而自潰的。若不行外科手術割開，有自然向膓腔，腸管，膀胱等處破潰的。最危險的是因此起敗血症或廣泛性穿孔的腹膜炎；往往致命。</p>
<p>（問）蚓突炎和肓腸周圍炎的治療方針，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）急性症時，病人應該絶對安臥，一二天内須要絶食。或與以牛乳，肉羹，卵黃，果汁等。待疼痛已减，經過一星期後可漸漸給以軟食。藥品以鎭靜劑爲主；排便用灌腸法。移行到慢性時，那末食物要忌粗劣，注意便通，腹外貼以温濕布或魚石瀦軟音。此外行外科手術，愈早切開愈好，遲恐危險程度增高。危急時，更不可不速施手術。</p>

<p>（十）口蓋扁桃腺肥大症</p>
<p>讀過本刊第九期的諸位。大概已經認識了扁桃腺。所以講起扁桃腺的病理變化來。也就容易得多了。扁桃腺的病理變化。最要緊的，就是他的增殖肥大和炎症二項。增殖肥大最容易侵犯的扁桃腺。第一要推口蓋扁桃腺。第二要算咽頭扁桃腺。現在我先講口蓋扁桃腺肥大症。下期再講咽頭扁桃腺增殖症。</p>
<p>口蓋扁桃腺肥大症，原名稱爲Ｈypertrophiatonsillaepalatiuae在臨床上小兒似乎比較多一點。更是在有腺病質的小兒。最容易發生。但是成人發生的。也不在少數。這是因爲時常患着急性扁桃腺炎而誘發的緣故。這個病還有遺傳的關係。譬如患本症的小兒。他的父母也會有過同樣的病。或者姊妹兄弟當中。都有這個病症。我們做醫師的是常常遇得着這種例子的。本症在輕度的時候。並不覺得什麽痛苦。有時祗覺咽頭有異樣的感覺。這是咽頭發炎的原因。在高度的時候。口蓋扁桃腺腫大著明。甚至左右兩個互相接觸。咽腔亦因此而獗隘（見圖）。病人也就苦訴各種病象。卽（一）咽頭獗隘。有異樣感覺。（二）嚥物和呼吸。都受障碍。（三）發音不準。（四）睡眠的時候。常發鼻音鼾聲。（五）反射的症候，如咳嗽，喘息，頭痛等。（六）扁桃腺窩大都深而廣。常常發生白色或黃白色乾乳樣殘廢物。此種殘廢物在醫學上。稱作扁桃腺栓Ｍandelpfropf。如用顯微鏡來檢查。則可見乾燥的分泌物，剥脫的上皮，和各種細菌等。</p>
<p>患口蓋扁桃腺肥大症的小兒或成人。是很容易感染鼻膜炎，扁桃腺料，中耳炎，氣管支炎。並可併發咽頭扁桃腺增殖症和急性或慢性關節僂麻質斯。所以本症對於人體健康上。實有莫大的影響。關於治療方面。藥物是無效的。是要用手術的。不過肥大在輕度的時候。到了春機發動期。可以由生理的退行變性而萎縮。那就用不着行手術。就可自已治愈（尤以小兒爲然。）肥大若在高度而已經發生咽腔獗隘，嚥物和呼吸受障碍。或者常發扁桃腺炎的時候。那就非用手術不可。手術的方法有兩種。一種稱爲扁桃腺切除術Ｔonsillotomie。是切除口蓋扁桃腺一部分的方法。多用在小兒。一種稱爲扁桃腺摘出術Ｔonsillektomie。是摘出口蓋扁桃腺全部分的方法。多用在成人。但是也要顧及局部的情形和全身的關係。方可决定用那一種手術方法。好在這種决斷。是屬於專科醫師責任上事體。諸位也可不必詳細的討論啊。</p>
<p>口蓋扁桃腺肥大症在口腔内的狀况。如左圖。</p>
<p>（一）上口唇</p>
<p>（二）下口唇</p>
<p>（三）舌</p>
<p>（四）軟口蓋</p>
<p>（五）懸壅垂</p>
<p>（六）前口蓋弓</p>
<p>（七）後口蓋弓</p>
<p>（八）口蓋扁桃腺肥大的形狀</p>
<p>（九）咽頭後壁</p>

<p>第六章　肺結核症的分期</p>
<p>肺結核分一二三三期，差不多是無人不知的；一般社會的人們，大概都曉得：第一期係可痊愈的，第二期就比較不同了，第三期是幾乎没有希望的。這一種傳說的原來，完全是根據ＴurbanGerhardt的立論而演化的。他的大意是；（一）第一期。在這時期的病症面積是很小的。他是輕度的而限於肺全葉一小部分的，特殊是在肺尖而不逾越鎖骨界限的；在聽診方面的小泡無響性的水泡音，是或有或無的。（二）第二期。現在是由局部的小面積而向外蔓延了，但無論如何，是逗留於第三期背後的。（三）第三期。在此時一個全葉或數個全葉都現浸潤狀態，並且發生空洞的。這一種三期的分别，完全是憑藉病勢的而積而立論，和病理解剖上的分類丨丨病灶的性質丨丨是毫不相干的：當然在學理上的價舉是不很高的。我們要曉得，每一病症的演進和經過，本來是没有决對的界限的；其中比較最有規則的是眞性肺炎。他的外表症象，和裏面的病理解剖變化，幾乎是「桴鼓相應」的。但他的病變型式，也並不是個個如此模範式的。對於病勢最複雜的肺結核症，那當然是更加困難了！他的臨床上的症象和經過，旣毫無一定，在病理解剖方面，雖有增生性和滲出性乾酪和空洞的種種的分别；但大多數病人的肺部裏面，差不多是各式俱備的。根據這種情形，肺結核在學理上分作幾期，幾乎是不可能的工作。這一種憑藉病勢的面積而立論，當然是無可奈何中的一個辦法，但恰是明白曉暢面容易了解的；在本病統計規則固已採用了，結果在一般的社會中，也就無人不知而視爲天經地義了。</p>

<p>戲塲是「各色人等」能够「佛說有緣」般，藉以不期而會的唯一塲所。也就是各色可傳病病菌「得其所哉」地，藉以傳布的一個神秘的所在。換句話說，機會不佳時，戲塲也就可變傳染病交易所；而大宗交易品，畢竟是飛沫傳染病丨丨大部份呼吸系傳染病多屬此類。門上倩了軍警保護着，也只能防止宵小的滋事，或是阻當不速之客（也許是有了優待劵，而忘却未帶的貴客）的看白戲，却無從拒絶病人病郵的不上門買票丨丨我國各地報告「法定傳染病」，和隔離病人病郵之舉，尚未辦通，能行走的病人病郵，涉足游戲塲的，來源特多。戲塲裏旣難免不有飛沫傳染病的病人病郵混跡其間，這些人各自「大吹法螺」，噴散飛沫，同時因爲塲中人多氣少，不免要互吸他人呼出的氣體，以資接濟，健康游客也不免就此連一連二的把病人或病郵的飛沫吸進去，抵抗力薄弱的人回家撑了病，到了危篤彌留之際，還不自知何從染得：方寸中暗暗自嗟「關張無命」哩，不亦大可悲乎！</p>
<p>吾人在戲塲裏，爲了要得到精神上的消遣，有時却不免如此這般染到飛沫傳染病，牠的摧命，且每須「切切毋違」，「依限繳銷」，委實未免得不償失，有些不上算。所以在地方上有某種飛沫傳染病丨丨如流行性感冒，天哮嗆，肺炎，麻疹，鼠疫，以及腦脊髓熱，白喉，猩紅熱等等丨丨丨流行的時候，最好暫時停止看戲。如果在這當兒來了個名角，著名鉅片，著名藝術大家，失之交臂，未免可惜，不得不硬着頭皮去看他一看，那麽最好理直氣壯地做一做「超時代的怪物」，老實不客氣戴了面套去看，庶幾「誤畜變童，幸鄰俠女」，伏「魔」無術，護身有「符」，可使衛生不妨娱樂，娱樂不忘衛生啦！事實上將來各地，如能切實舉辦衛生，除流行性感冒大流行時，雖停閉戲院，亦無從阻遏外，他種飛沫傳染的急性病症流行時，地方衛生當局或須首先勒令戲院暫停營業，以便防堵，到了那時，怕戲迷影迷雖欲過癮，而亦不可得也。</p>
<p>至於戲院方面，能知所負責任，爲使人娱樂獲益，不可使人欲益反損，售了有限之票價，隨時置辦無上的舒適設備，舉凡空氣之通暢，流動，温度，濕度之適中，塵埃之止息，休息時出塲出入證之推行（劇塲亦應横揷休息時間），莫不力求完備，一面復注意取締小販，茶房，茶水，茶杯，整飭痰盂，便所，使無一不精潔，無一不足以表示其爲高尚娱樂塲所，那是頂漂亮的商人道德；對於營業，實在也大有影響的。不良戲院，就是地方官廳不加取締，社會上也自有種自然制裁。只要人人吃了一次虧，抱着「下不爲例」的成見，那家戲院無形中就無人光顧了。將來待我們大家注意了衛生，這種制裁一定還要比現在凶咧！又這許多大半是内地小都市特有的現象。鄕間酬神演戲，就請「草臺班」在露天搭棚表演，好像都會裏夏令的露天電影，對於空氣之容量和流動，都可不成問題。說句老實品，如果城市下等戲院無力改善，倒不如還淳返樸，索性也就在露天開演啦。</p>

<p>東方是有着傳統的專制主義的，土耳其，波斯，印度，照例一方面治人一方面被治。這情况雖然在現世存留，然有思想者决不能否認民約論在世界上的影響。</p>
<p>照例是求平等而仍然不平，不平的情况是不可免的。這時思想普通只有一條出路丨丨冷嘲。是被壓迫者稍藉以生存的救藥。</p>
<p>如果可以生，可以死，可以笑，可以哭，情感各有適當的發展，天下太平；如求生不行，求死不行，欲笑不許，欲哭不許，將情感摧毁無餘，則一切錯亂。每當不許哭不許笑的時候，突然來了一度解放，那是丨丨滑稽，是冷嘲的同調。</p>
<p>人們的情感時常是怯於眞理，畏懼現實。專看悲劇慘淡，專看喜劇無聊，所以其中必來一種滑稽劇，隱過眞實，混過時間，給人們一種發舒，大笑而散，只看社會上人善談笑話者爲衆人所歡迎，便知道這道理。</p>
<p>滑稽和冷嘲亦不相同，後者有意義，前者無意義。後者屬於劇中的主角，前者屬於小丑。二者同爲苦工，例如故意要使人發笑，作出種種怪狀來，也經過慘淡經營的。</p>
<p>反之，被治者冷嘲，治人者滑稽。在專制的暴君下要行譎諫，走偏鋒，一肚皮笑話和各種怪狀决不可少。這也不下於他種「王佐」的功勞。只有屈原太認眞，「將突梯滑稽如脂如韋以潔楹平？」已將滑稽者並入油類了。也足見屈原之冷嘲如此。</p>
<p>但另外有一些問題：中國是只有滑稽劇呢，抑也有悲喜劇？是故意裝丑脚呢，抑丑脚裝正生？是介乎丑脚與不丑脚之間呢，抑是在演三千年前給人們看的某種古劇？……</p>

<p>（九）南北亭之遊</p>
<p>忙裏偷閑，在一個清晨，我們作南北亭之遊。</p>
<p>出博山門，過了橋，便是以風景聞名的南北亭了。先到北亭，古爲怡園，今爲怡園小學，有雷祖殿，香火不衰。有一亭樓，面臨金魚池，壁上石刻「鳶飛魚躍」四字，氣魄雄偉。池中有金魚甚大，惜池水不清，無甚雅趣。</p>
<p>出北亭，對街穿過，到南亭。今爲建設局地址，相傳係范仲淹棲止之地。内有泉，池方約一方丈許，土人因以范泉名之。並建祠曰范公祠。</p>
<p>然而我們到過長山，范仲淹生長在長山倒是眞事；而且博山從前又不是個大縣，范公何以來此，當地傳說實在有點兒靠不住</p>
<p>范泉出了南亭，水分三股往外流，南到錢園，北到怡園；其另一股便沿石橋西流入城。這股泉水非常有趣，這眞是博山特有的一種奇景！</p>

<p>— 小默</p>
<p>讀書人之爲商品，已是古今同慨。從「我待善價而沽」的夫子，到拿文憑當商標的畢業生，都證明讀書人的聲價與古代東方市塲上的奴隸高不了多少。隨着勞動力之商品化，知識自身有了交換價值，讀書人也變成了特殊商品的所有主。然中國的讀書人以社會不長進之故，還不足以語自由契約，連讀「賽恩斯」的也免不了賣身投靠。</p>
<p>讀書人底使用價值與賣力氣的底使用價值之異，正如主人眼中鷹犬和牛馬底差别那樣。不過這個萬物之靈的商品，畢竟與旁的商品有點不同，小麥咖啡銷不去的時候只有屯在貨倉裏霉爛，但是不得明主而事之的士人却會哀鳴，孤憤，甚或挺而走險；雖說秀才造反三年不成，然若把隴上太息的耕夫鼓動起來，天下便從此多事。此商品博覽會和商品檢騐局似的考試制度之所以可貴也！</p>
<p>在今日經濟恐慌中，不單是一般的商品生産過剩，這種特殊的商品丨丨知識的商品丨丨必然也跟着生産過剩。一方面見「社會的傾銷」（Ｓocialdunrping）他方面，這種商品因没有消納的尾閭而横潰放决，政治上的極端主義便出來了。在中國情形更是慘酷。每年特殊的工廠丨丨學校丨丨一批一批把牠們粗製濫造出來，推到市塲去，然供過於求，消路呆滯，這種現象一天存在，社會一天不得穩定。所以這事總不能不加以注意的</p>
<p>在每年暑假將要開始的時候，報紙上常看見好些送畢業生或討論學生出路的文章。今年更是熱閙，其中最可注意的還是胡適之博士「贈與今年的大學畢業生」一文（文，二四，大公報）。他除開了三個防身舊藥方之外，還新添了一個，就是：「你得先自已反省；不可專責備别人，更不必責備社會。」據他的高見，畢業生找不到一碗飯吃，不是因爲社會不用他，而是因爲他自已的功課不好，或錯進了野鷄學校。這是多麽漂亮而風凉的話呵！這彷彿是獨占或大工廠的商品對小工廠的商品說：「你們不要埋怨買主或妒忌别人，先要自怨自艾，誰呌你的貨色劣等，而出身的工廠的牌子又不老呢？」一切的售不去的商品們，記着這ＭadeinU·S·A·的名廠老牌的商品的敎訓吧！</p>
<p>最近北平的大學畢業生更有「職業運動大同盟」的組織，雖然没有「民權」「反帝」這種字眼，但「運動」，「同盟」兩個名詞，總是剌耳，不難閙出亂子來。爲穩定政治市塲計，我們應該想一個統制的辦法。</p>
<p>我們知道救濟生産過剩的最通行的辦法是限制生産和規定商品消受的數額丨丨在日本稱爲「割當制」，在歐美稱「ＱuotaSystem」，這種辦法在希特勒的德國已拿來施於特殊的商品學生丨丨之生産。希特勒一上台的時候卽頒佈「取締德國學校人數擁擠」的法律，而採用入學「割當制」。但那時受限制的還只是猶太種的學生。到了去年年底，德國便有新的法律，限制一般大學生的人數。根據這個法律，大學入學試及格和升入大學的高中畢業生，在一九三四年只以一萬五千人爲限。但依照政府的估計，該年在高中畢業而可升入大學的學生，應該有男二萬七千六百名，女一萬零四百名。這卽是說，本可以升入大學的學生之五分三，被剥奪了這種權利。這原怪不得的，在希特勒的獨裁未樹立以前，德國的知識的商品之滯消已很有可觀：八千名的工程畢業生中，只有一千人找到職業，二萬二千的候補敎員中只有三千九百人得到副敎員的職位，柏林的藝術家中有百分之七十二的每月收入在五十馬克以下。在這種情况之下大學生的增多，自然只會爲自由主義，極端主義，多散佈一些種子。所以希特勒限制這種特殊商品的生産，確是釜底抽薪的辦法。未知將來中國的統制是怎樣。</p>
<h3 id="c246">職業的搶奪 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 查士驥</p>
<p>最近在本刊上讀得了兩篇關於青年就業問題的文章。一是尢墨君先生的，一是白戈先生的。兩人的意見，完全相反；尢先生謂青年的能否得職，决不是社會没有職業供給他們，而是没有青年們所理想的好職業給他們；白戈先生則認之爲整個的社會問題，意即社會上根本没有這許多職位來供給新的畢業生。</p>
<p>兩見之中，我當然是認白戈先生之說的。理由很簡單，正如白戈先生所說的，「……即使一般青年學生都依着尢先生指出的路走去，那結果無非將另一部份，少有機會受敎育，没有取得較高地位的在業的人擠出，變成失業者，使彼此掉換了一個地位。」</p>
<p>失業的根本救濟法，自然在於增加職業的數量，决不是彼此的掉換。然而在這不景氣瀰漫於全世界之際，還有什麽新的開發的可能？猶之一杯水，渴的人少時，大家還可以隨隨便便，一旦渴的人多而量不足時，就得發生搶奪運動了。所謂搶奪，原不過「掉換」了職業的主人，即無職者中有一個得了職，就是有職者中産生了一個失業者。</p>
<p>默察現社會的趨勢，搶職運動，日形露骨。照理，職業的競爭者愈多，應得是最有才能的才被採用，老邁無能者必遭淘汰，在任用者方面，必感到選擇的方便。但在實際上，則恰恰相反。當社會爲深刻的恐慌所籠罩時，生存競爭旣烈，用人的標凖將更形嚴峻而狹隘。所謂嚴峻，並不是才能詮考之謂，而是「利害關係」。在封建思想尚甚根深的中國社會上，其必成爲了純粹的親屬主義或同鄕主義，是無可疑慮的。那些没有同鄕及親戚可靠的，就職之難必甚於較爲景氣的時候。</p>
<p>再就在職者方面說，因爲競爭者的衆多，他們必戰戰兢兢謀現職的保存。像人數較多的海關郵局之類，因爲考試的關係，他們早已結成了很强的團體。到了今日，則即人數較少的，他們也有相當的結合，以謀對付他人的搶職。所以時代愈不景氣，此種排他的組織也必愈發達。由經濟上說起來，好像是由自由交換的經濟歸返到古昔的封鎖經濟。簡言之，旣已得到職業的，决不願意隨隨便便使其職位失去，所以新的畢業生及青年，將愈加感到找事的不易。</p>
<p>由上兩種理由，我們可以知道，就算職業的掉換，（如大學生做中學畢業生的事，中學畢業生做小學畢業生的事）能眼前糊塗一時，但到了恐慌的程度眞眞深刻化了的時候，也必因用人者的拘於利害關係，在職者的團結抵抗，連掉換也將成爲不可能。</p>

<p>— 黎錦明</p>
<p>吳稚暉先生在八月一日自由談上說：「文學不死，大禍不止」。這話頗令人驚悚不置。</p>
<p>打開東西洋的歷史一看，從遠古直到當今，似手還没有一個文人作家一手握筆，一手操刀的人物。更没有一個說是以文學爲政綱，粖馬厲兵，攻城拓地，和皇朝作對的。詩經之成，只是些弱小到連說話也不敢的小百姓的哀怨之音；楚辭之作，不過成因于屈原的耿介寒酸，不會鑽營，如果說他實際是失戀于某女性，而故意借題發揮，亦未始不可。至于說到後來造反的人物，曾受過詩經楚辭的剌激的，更是絶對没有。例要舉得淺：水滸的作者，爲什麽不把宋江吳用之流，寫做一些「埋頭把卷」，「拍案投筆」的志士？如果說是「新豐折臂翁」，朱門酒肉自，路有凍死骨」這些零散詩篇會引起及時雨的豪興，質之施耐菴，恐怕未必能有具體的答覆。又如說惡賊李自成張戲忠，史乘與傳說，並不提到他們「…性豪爽，好任俠，終日把水滸傳不釋，以宋公明自居…」等等的話。就比方說當今的朱德毛澤東之流，他們懂得什麽哈卜德曼，蘇特曼，瓦塞曼，亨利曼，託馬斯曼這些曼麽？恐怕什麽是「文」，什麽是「大衆語」丨他們也莫名其妙。…老實說，不用說在初中本國史，就是一部二十四史也找不出這例子來的。</p>
<p>在外國想來想去，也只有一個大流氓魏龍；但魏龍的瞎搗亂，大半也出之傳說，不可盡信。至于說盧騷直拉影響于法國大革命，也是胡說；法國路易十六時代，巴黎城的百姓們大亂荒，流亡日衆，他們要搶麵包是不可免的，不過丹東羅伯斯庇爾是一些梟獍人物自是不庸說，但也不曾聽說這些人講過什麽狄德羅盧騷的哲學。說到俄帝室的覆亡，老實說，與什麽託翁，陀翁，高翁都很少關係；他們不在遠東打一敗仗，不在德國又打一敗仗，也不會坍台坍得那麽快的。總之，一個國家，政治無論出于何種形式，只要做得大衆有飯喫，大家無話可說，軍事上不會因逞野心而失敗，危及邦家，就是文學家出來說幾句不着癢處的閒話，大家還會覺得討厭呢。</p>

<p>於是他們大量地喝着酒，有些人簡直是張開了喉嚨灌下去的。（其實，這也並不能認爲是適賞的理由，因爲他們對於酒的愛好，一向是爲人所深知。）就是那些没有多少錢來買一醉的，（也許還餓着兩頓飯的肚子），也要裝成醉醺醺的樣子，走起路來要東倒西歪，故意含含混混地說話。這却完全是爲了體面的原因。</p>
<p>老阿克索衣諾夫沉默地坐在他的貨物之間，眯着眼睛，似睡不睡地　臥在那高的圈手椅的裏面。他那紅色的臉，堆滿了縐紋，正像一個在太陽下矖過三天的蘋果，使人看見了就要發着不舒服之感。而且他是乾枯，瘦小，像一隻猴子，只是缺少那尖銳的目光。他的眼睛不只是不尖銳，還總是露了疲憊的樣子，也難怪，他用它們張望過七十四年的人世了。他的手傑鷄的脚，只是骨骼上包了一層皮，筋絡一條條地都突起來。</p>
<p>每個看到他的人，都對於老年增加了更甚的恐怖。在心中問着自已：「我也要活到那麽使人討厭的年歳麽？」</p>
<p>算是他的貨物，種樣是多的，只有一個共同性，那就是舊。旣然是「舊物八雜」舖子，貨物之舊是當然的，只是他的貨物之陳舊，就如同他這個人一樣，到了只有使人嘆氣的地步。那些貨物有一八八零年最應時的女人披肩，有着五十年的歷史，却褪盡了顔色；還有磨去表皮的長筒皮靴，被蟲子蝕了無數洞孔的舊禮服和帽子，在發明那一年，就造出來的留聲機，銙成黃色的一些鐵器，少了一隻脚的寫字桌，丨丨許多許多不同的東西，有的還爲年青人所未曾看見過，在驚奇之外，也還對於用途有點莫明其妙。</p>

<p>— 若望</p>
<p>處世需要一種藝術，這是誰都不再加否的。不過世界上的事情各種各樣的都有，因而處世的藝術也就隨着種類繁多得很，就如一件事情需要謾駡，那就有「駡人的藝術」，需要捧塲，也有「捧角的藝術，」男女間的戀愛，更是一件最道地不過的藝術，假如要把這一類一類分别着說來，少說點可以寫成一本定價六角以上的小册子，時間如有多餘，把它伸展成專著，亦無不可，不過這些都不是像我們這般被人家尊稱爲「投稿家」之類的小癟山所配說的，那麽就此打住，下面言歸正傳便了。</p>
<p>却說八仙橋青年會古宫式的高樓上，盛筵初開，燈綠酒紅，丨註：夏令宜裝綠電燈，喝葡萄酒。丨白領巾的佳賓滿座，假如你這小癟山也徼倖被請列席，不那天蒙你撥冗駕臨了的話，那麽你不能顯出這輩子没有吃過大菜的急相，開快車，大嚼特嚼，你必須要忍住一點飢腸，顯得滿不在乎，甚而至於呌僕歐來說一句：「今天的牛排没有昨天的新鮮。」或是吃了兩口便擱下不吃，這樣，别人便會以爲你是在外國曾經吃過幾年洋麵包的，至少總認爲你是青年會的老客，而不敢輕視你。</p>
<p>那麽就這麽一樣一樣吃到完了就算了嗎？當然不能，那麽在席時候再做些什麽呢？這全要看你的藝術手腕和當時的情景如何而定。假如你覺得空氣岑寂，你可以把腦筋轉過這麽兩三百個圈，找這麽三句五名笑話一說，引得滿座噴菜捧腹。而這種笑料所取的來源，最好從紳士派的幽默家那裏去發現，因爲這樣便會顯得你也是頗紳士化的。可是你如没有紳士派的笑話可說，找一種别樣的也可以，不過提到的人還是要在大處找，好比胡適之在北平逛窰子給他夫人小脚婦閙翻啦，吳稚暉坐船没有錢把大掛子都脫下來押給船家之類。</p>
<p>如果空氣温和，需要談一些稍微正經一點的話，那麽你看見某作家的朋友×某也在席，你便可以高高地問一聲：「某某這幾天碰頭没有？」如答稱「没有，那麽你馬上接着便說「你碰見他說我這幾天有點小不舒服，很少到外邊來。」這樣，不管你認識不認識某作家而祗要直呼某某，人家已經知道你和某作家是老朋友。而呼名字的一事又着實值得講究了。</p>
<p>你如果把張學良呌做張少帥，蔡元培呌做蔡孑民，人家就會猜度你曾當過什麽秘秘書。</p>
<p>將名人的名字落了一個姓，就是達夫，資平，仿吾，雖然人家未必就比也當你是名人，可是至少也得認爲你是名人的朋友。不過没有了姓或是免用了姓的名人，却又必須加上一個姓才會顯和他相熟，如冰心就呌謝冰心，廬隴就呌黃廬隱。</p>
<p>假如一個朋友剛剛由人介紹與你認識，你當然會先問他是什麽地方的人，他如是籍隸南通，你便可以隨便說一個人名來問一問：「南通城裏有一個姓張的張謇認識不認識？」接着你們便可以談到各人的求學的興趣，如果對方是研究美術的你便可以談到劉海粟，徐悲鴻，林風眠等等，西洋方面的，可以說出一大堆法文名字，對方如果研究文學，那材料更是拾來便是，你如覺談話空虚，在前幾年可以專翻一點趙景深楊昌溪譯的文壇情報作爲談話的資料，現在也可以常常看一看各報屁股上的戰士文學，探一探到底現在又打着什麽官司？</p>
<p>對方如愛看電影，愛談女人，那麽眞呌三天三夜都談勿完哉，那麽祗好擱筆不談。</p>

<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>老鍾是吾們四個同事中比較年事最長的一個；他姓鍾，他媽給他取的名字呌阿狗，後來進了學堂，先生又替他取了一個比較文雅的名字，呌「佐庭」當然，這是藴蓄着封建的思想。他的老師是科舉出身的，所以處處没把，「讀書志在聖賢，爲官心存君國」的幾句讀書人應有的明訓忘掉。「佐庭」，自然是希望他將來做，在官去「輔佐朝庭」的意思，可惜，等到他要想去應試的時候，科舉已廢了。因此，老鍾這個官夢終於没有「機會給他實現，這是他平生最遺憾的一件事！</p>
<p>但是人家，却不喊他「佐庭」而祗直捷地呼他一聲老鍾；這老鍾兩字，在他自已年來，也似乎是一個很光榮的頭銜，所以遇到人家呼他老鍾，他便很得意極了。對人家講起話來，也時常左手把胸脯一拍，右手撓起了個大拇指頭，點着鼻頭說道：</p>
<p>「𠳾！吾老鍾不是誇口的說一句……」他自已說着就很得意的狂笑了。傍邊聽他說的人，也都笑得合不攏嘴來。</p>
<p>老鍾的年齡，不大也不算小，看起來倒有四十來歲的光景，這在他自已也没有確實的計數過，依是幾歲？只有從形式上去看他，鄕下人有句話：「不要問婆婆的年紀，但要看婆婆的面嘴」。吾的答數，也是往老鍾的面嘴上看來的</p>
<p>他雖已四十來歲的年紀了，可是他的頷下還是那末光秃秃的，像老太婆的面孔一樣，找不出一根髭鬚毛根來。那倒並不是他駐顔有術，實在是他每天只要一落空就坐在凳子上，拿了一面鏡子，拿了一只箝子，細細地箝着，要箝得一根没有了纔歇。他雖然歡喜人家稱他老鍾，但不願意人家說他年紀老，要是偶然有人說他年紀大了，他就要不快的；甚至，會用着强辯的口吻說：</p>
<p>「老了！誰說的？要出了鬍子纔可算老呢。」</p>
<p>他有一個老婆，也住在上海，是個風韻猶存的半老徐娘；和他感情不大好，她整天打扮得花枝招展的混在遊藝塲裏，她那臉蛋兒因爲生得並不十分討厭·更加她的招蜂引蝶的手段又强，所以</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>她混的成績倒也不推板。她也曾生過兩個孩子，一男一女，因爲没有好好的扶養都先後天殤了。</p>
<p>老鍾在吾們店裏，做了整整三個年頭的伙計，在同事間倒很和氣，人家也都當他一個小孩看待的，就是碰到有人駡他一頓，或說他幾聲，他也祇一笑置之，並不動氣的。他每年祇回家裏過一夜，在冬至夜那晚上回走，明天一早就回店裏來了，會打趣的朋友，總是要去挖苦他幾句。</p>
<p>「老鍾！你家裏好久不去了，你的老婆趣一個小白臉溜啦！」</p>
<p>「吾不管，吾不管，誰有這末閑去答她們？」</p>
<p>「哈哈！好大量！老鍾！你摸摸背心看，哈！哈！哈！」一陣狂笑及鼓掌聲，使老鍾的臉上，飛來了兩朶紅雲。最後他便囁嚅地走開了了避去了他們那難堪的謔浪。</p>
<p>據他自已告訴吾們：他在二十三四歲的時候，也曾演過一次羅曼斯的喜劇，後來，那個小姑娘不知怎的就變了心，同另一個小夥子去戀愛上了，他没有能力再把一顆少女的心去從别人手裏奪得回來，只有惆悵和失望而已！</p>
<p>這一段故事，可惜他說得略而不詳，所以無從寫起；不然，倒是老鍾傳裏很好的材料。</p>

<p>自然，在這偏僻的地方，街上是不會熱閙的，燈，像一串晶亮的珠子，怪幽閒的摇曳着，偶爾有一兩個行人踽踽，地過去了。</p>

<p>聲音，很細嫩，像一個孩童，調子，在那沉暗的天氣里，該是多麽的悲切呵！眞的，這哀號的調子是逐漸的高大了，高大了。聲音，多熟悉，我意識到又是鄰舍的那個小寶在嘗試着手刑。</p>

<p>……褐色的頭髮，倭小的身子，不相稱的臉龐，破敗的衣着，還有，姑黃和削瘦的皮膚，腫脹與悸動的眼球呵！不，不祇這些，驚恐，畏懼……描繪着一幅極複雜的輪廓。</p>
<p>丨拍拍拍……。在沉靜中又極清脆的蹢進了我的耳朶。</p>
<p>丨哼，你還偷懶，當心……</p>
<p>那神氣一定是很氣憤的，這，在腔調裏可以領略出來。</p>
<p>的確，哭只是在普通的責打下的一種回響，假使在加重的拷打以後，這回響會要收藏起來的，於此，播送的是些什麽呢？加快的詬駡和叱責喲！</p>
<p>當第二天太陽西斜的時候，我從街上回來，進了弄口，留意的張望着，但，小寶的踪跡呢？不見了，不見了。</p>
<p>眞的，我不明白爲什麽要對於她這樣的關心，懷念的情緒會充塞在胸際；是的，她或許已受了重傷？或許已臥倒在床？或者竟至不能動彈？也許……種種地思慮在盤旋着，不停止的。</p>
<p>夜晚，在床上轉側着，想像像電影般的在亂轉。陡的，一個女孩内蕩起來，皮肉，那樣的削瘦，上身赤裸着，一條條地佈滿了血痕，眼眶裏，藴含着滿滿地涙水，口唇，不住的抽咽，掛在他的面容的那慘厲的態呵！</p>
<p>最後，她哭了，嘴角瑟動着，顫抖着，發出了低細的呻吟！</p>
<p>丨天呵，幾時才能逃出了這熊熊地火井呢？</p>
<p>當微風過去的時候，帶過來一些餘腥，必情在紊亂着，無論如何也不能使牠安靜下去，抬起了頭，窗外的雨絲在浙瀝浙瀝的落着，淋到了案頭，淋到了窗上，怪凄清的，彷彿在象微着小寶的命運似的。</p>

<p>我今年是十九歲了。在十四歲那年的正月，被家中送入鄰縣最大的一家綢布店裏做學生，到今年有六年了。在這六年中也不知學些什麽，總覺得很之乏味，恐將來没什麽希望所以就想改入銀行做練習生。因爲我想，入了銀行，是一定的辦事時間能在晚間去讀書，對於學識方面。可以增加。若長此在布店裏，虚擲光隂，所以在今年七月間我要求家父替我去找銀行練習生的位置，但是一時很不容易找到，我想，與其要入銀行做練習生，不如早離店，補習一些學科以便將來服務較爲便利，所以我又向家父要求給我到上海先入職業學校商科補習。他也允許了，我就在七月二十日回掉了六年的所學的職業，而到上海，現在是住在親戚家中。到上海就去投考職業學校以小學畢業程度去考初級一年，還好總算考入了，一所職校。但是，我家父聽說我已到上海他卽來信說：「汝旣習商六年，再去讀書，殊不方便。依予之意，自行開一國貨商店爲宜，汝以爲如何云云。」這我早也想到，但因該地現在已有國貨公司組織，並且市面清淡開店也不易。所以我回信没有同意。但是！我現在感覺着「改業無限的痛苦呢！因爲我現在若去讀書從初中一年讀起則至高中須六年畢業。那已二十五歲了，且家父也不能允許，這是事實上做不到的。若就商科讀一二年，不知這一二年讀後卽有銀行事給做嗎？若不去讀書則又不能回去，因我已面辭店員之職，並且我在店時立誓。說不回去的，若呌我回去，那只有跳黃浦江一路了，所以這幾天，思前想後，覺得前途黑暗可怕！爲了我自已决不下向那條光明的路上努力好，所以冒昧地，急迫地，懇求先生指示南針，感激不盡的，天氣很熱，字草得很，敬請原諒敬祝</p>
<p>撰安　　何士聰</p>
<p>答：我覺得你這個問題並不難解决。你目前可以暫在該校讀書，但另一方面你却須從速尋謀職業，如果你不願再做舊式商店店員，就托人爲你謀銀行練習生或其他你所願幹的位置。現在銀行招考練習生或低級職員之類對於學歷倒無嚴格的規定，主要的是看考試的成績。而考試又似乎注重在辦事經騐。所以，你所亟宜注意的是努力訓練辦事才幹，學習工作技能，並不一定要學校畢業。</p>
<p>其次，從學習方面講，也不一定要入學校，眞實本領大都是實際生活中經騐出來的，而且，祇要有志於學，書本知識也是可以自修，不必定要「有師傳授」的。學校比自修的唯一好處，就是多一張文憑並不是一張保單，它不能保你謀到職業。所以，就是商科畢業後，謀不到事的也甚多甚多，學校並不是職業介紹所也。</p>
<p>此外，我附帶還有兩點意見要忠告你：第一，現在做店員，固屬毫無進取希望，但做新式公司，洋行職員也好不到那裏。所以，你不必常常「這山看得那山高」，企圖改業。第二，做事固然要有工作技能，但現在這個矛盾的社會，失業觀衆很普遍，你有了本事也不見得一定有事做。但是你要不要生活，以爲生活就從此無法改善，職業也永無保障。辦法是有的，祇要你認清了這個社會矛盾，職業問題的癥結所在，你自然就知道你該怎樣的努力了。</p>

<p>— 林彬</p>
<p>呆子靜默着，眼角上的涙粒滾到臉頰上了。但接着又火山决口似的拚命唱起一首鄙野淫蕩的山歌，彷彿在發洩着胸中無限的悶氣。</p>
<p>時光一天一天地過去，漫漫的長冬終於過盡了。暖和的春陽洒滿了大地，有如聖潔少女的微笑，大自然罩上爛漫的新裝，現出妖艶的蕩婦似的勾人的騷態，散放着醉人而又悶人的温香。青春的神秘的烈火在每一青年男女的一細胞裏燃燒，使他們的肉體和靈魂起了神秘的變動，增加了幸運兒的幸福和不幸者的悲哀。</p>
<p>正當象徵着無數蒼生的碧血的少數蘋果色的臉兒浮着得意的微笑，做着玫瑰色的好夢的季候，我們這個没工錢白吃飯的長工正如沙漠中久渴的旅人喝了毒酒一樣，立時爲一種引向死滅的道途的興奮所支配，使他忘記了呆子應有的畏懼，忘記了危險和死。</p>
<p>一天晚上，呆子主人的隣居忽然聽見自已鷄窠裏的鷄羣大呌起來，滿以爲花貓拖鷄。她一邊喝着，一邊點起火油燈，披上衣服，開了門，衝到鷄窠邊一照，一隻最會生蛋的老母鷄不見了。她心痛得像失去了自已的愛子，通夜合不上眼。</p>
<p>第二天天剛破曉，呆子還没起身，那個失鷄的主婦就走出臥房門了。她兩眼還留着昨夜的涙影，到每個角落裏尋覓着母鷄被害的形跡。突然她做夢似的瞧見那已失的母鷄從呆子所在的牛欄角裏衝了出來，嚇了一跳。她立刻掏了一把米撒在地上，逗牠到跟前，搶寶似地一把給牠捧在膝頭上，煖烘烘的鷄身，顯然是在被窩裏過夜的。</p>
<p>像被孩子們玩厭了的玩具一樣的呆子，重新又獲得人們驚異的目光和烈熱的哄笑。</p>
<p>過了幾天，村裏湧起了一個驚人的消息，這消息先從幾個牧童的口中傳出來，接着就像野火一般地燒遍了全村。婦女們互相耳語着，像有誰家小姑偷生了孩子似的。老太婆們接連地哼着「阿彌陀佛」，好像想用這「阿彌陀佛」來消解無限的罪孽似的。有些好事的男子還特地爲牠編成一首不堪入耳的小曲，孩子們傳互相着誦。消息是：</p>
<p>「呆子姘上了吉祥庵的尼姑。」</p>
<p>說起這吉祥庵的尼姑，也着實可憐。她生在農家，自幼算了兩次命，都說要尅三夫的。九歲出了天花，臉孔又麻得像銅火踏的蓋了，有「滿天星」的綽號。於是這可憐的女孩的尼姑命就自然而然地被註定了，她十二歲進了我們的吉祥庵，到現在已有十多年了。去年失去了老師父，現今成了本庵唯一的主持。</p>

The Health Department has already established a severe drug rehabilitation center and a drug rehabilitation hospital to find ways to quit. The copper coin devaluation in Beiping is due to the proliferation of copper coin notes. Remedial measures have been discussed with the Hebei provincial government. The city has strict restrictions on the entry of copper coins. For example, in Tangshan and Luan County, one silver dollar can be exchanged for over 900 copper coins, while in Beiping, one silver dollar can only be exchanged for 540 coins. Nearby counties have recently sent people to Beiping to request that the restrictions on the entry of copper coins be relaxed, but this has been rejected. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>University Student Unemployment Problem</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Examination Committee member Huang Xuyun has been elected to draft measures to relieve unemployed college students. Huang said that the issue of unemployed college students will be discussed at the National Examination Conference, and relief measures are being drafted. However, the Beiping Professional Sports Federation previously made two petitions to the Examination Yuan, which we believe showed that they did not thoroughly understand the examination system. They requested the Executive Yuan to directly recruit this year's college graduates. This matter has been clearly stipulated in the Civil Servant Appointment Law. As long as the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan recruit, the Ministry of Personnel will not be a problem. The Examination Yuan's relief for unemployed college students is not limited to this year's graduates, nor is it limited to Beiping. Second, the past examinations were purely to select special talents and emphasized knowledge in books, which was a misunderstanding. The Second Higher Examination of the Examination Yuan emphasized practical service experience and did not focus solely on knowledge in books. The people that were recruited were very common, and the recruitment was not purely to select special talents. The number of people recruited does not seem to be very large, but if the Executive Yuan needs a lot, the Examination Yuan may lower the recruitment standards. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e31">Japan Further Expands Military Budget <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Okada Cabinet in Japan, it has increasingly estimated the so-called international crisis of 1935-1936 and heightened its sense of national defense security, placing emphasis on naval armaments to strive for absolute superiority on the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, in the next year's naval budget, it will focus on (1) completing the first naval replenishment plan and increasing maintenance costs for new ships; (2) forming new air squadrons and their maintenance costs; (3) renovating old ships; (4) building new ships. These types of budgets are estimated at 275 million Japanese yen. Adding the already determined expenditure of 420 million yen and 19 million yen for increased costs due to rising prices, the total naval budget will reach 714 million yen. On the army side, there are new demands for air defense enhancement expenses, military equipment improvement expenses, and Manchurian incident expenses, totaling no less than 320 million yen. Adding the already determined expenditure of 230 million yen, the total amounts to approximately 550 million yen. The combined total for the army and navy is 1.264 billion yen, which is 328 million yen more than this year's military expenditure of 936 million yen. This truly marks the entry into a wartime budget period.</p>
<p>Japanese militarists are obsessed with the ambition of dominating the Pacific. They also believe that the development of Japan's overseas trade and the opening of markets must rely on the absolute superiority of the navy to maintain future security and ensure the smooth flow of exports. Therefore, at the beginning of Okada's rise to power, army and navy personnel vigorously advocated the high-sounding principle of national defense security, which Okada then supported, prioritizing the strengthening of the navy. Consequently, they disregarded everything and exerted all their strength to develop their military operational strengths, such as increasing the construction of submarines, enhancing light and heavy cruisers, and increasing air squadrons, all with the aim of expanding defenses in the Pacific Ocean. In other words, they are implementing their so-called Asian Monroe Doctrine. Although the army has not immediately increased new divisions, the number of troops stationed in various parts of the Northeast exceeds 100,000. The 3rd, 7th, 10th, 11th, and 16th divisions, and other special units within Japan, have all become expeditionary forces stationed for extended periods in various parts of the Northeast. In their original garrison areas, equivalent reserve units have been conscripted. Therefore, the Japanese army has increased its regular army strength by at least about 100,000. As for the army's efforts to enhance its air squadrons, the goal is to completely replace old-style aircraft and extend their range to 12,000 kilometers. Thus, the Japanese air force can threaten Vladivostok, travel between Hong Kong and Tokorozawa, and have more than enough capability to threaten the Philippines. With such significant progress, who can doubt their intention to launch a war?</p>
<p>Therefore, besides Russia, the country that feels most endangered by Japan's expansion of armaments is the United States, which is far away on the other side of the Pacific. In peacetime, the United States is wary of the difficulties facing naval disarmament conferences, fearing that once the principle of proportionality is broken, the balance of power in the Far East will not be maintained, and future market expansion will be obstructed. Considering the existing naval strength, Japan's submarines and cruisers are already superior to those of the United States. The only areas where it lags behind are battleships and air squadrons. Japan, taking advantage of this natural geographic advantage in the Western Pacific, even without huge battleships, is already more than capable of seizing the Philippines and capturing Guam. If it forms a strong air force, there is concern that the Aleutian Islands will also have difficulty accommodating the stable presence of the U.S. Air Force. Previously, when Japan advocated for naval parity and the abolition of the Washington and London treaties, the United States strongly advocated for peace, believing that the principle of proportionality should not be changed abruptly and further proposed reducing existing forces by 20 percent. However, Japan is expanding its forces as much as possible and is now unprecedentedly increasing its military budget. Although the United States is extremely cautious in this situation, can it not fear the damage to its interests in the Far East and consider timely precautions? Recently, the United States has paid great attention to armaments, seeking to maintain its forward base in Hawaii and build up its air defenses in Alaska, all of which have been prompted by Japan's intensified military expansion plans.</p>
<p>England is already in an economically irreconcilable position with Japan. Now, seeing Japan's steady progress in expanding its military strength, which subjects the Far Eastern market entirely to the control of Japanese power, even the security of areas as far west as India is threatened. Australia, located in the remote South Pacific, must also increase its defenses. Consequently, England is also catching up urgently, and the relationship between England and Japan is becoming increasingly divided. In short, the result of Japan's increased military spending is merely to stir up war clouds over the Pacific.</p>
<p>Seeking Peace in the Pacific</p>
<h3 id="e32">Conclusion of a Six-Nation Pact <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Proposed by Soviet Russia, Opposed by Japan</p>
<p>Attitudes of the U.S., Britain, and France Appear Cold</p>
<p>(London) Recently, there has been discussion about forming a six-nation pact to maintain peace in the Pacific, based on the Eastern European Locarno Pact. The so-called six nations are Britain, the United States, Japan, Russia, China, and France. The core of this plan is to unite the naval and military forces of the six nations to assist countries that are invaded to resist foreign aggression. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov made a similar proposal to U.S. disarmament representative Davis between May and June of this year. At that time, Davis only listened to it without making any criticism or indicating any opinions from Washington. Last winter, when Litvinov visited President Roosevelt in the United States, he seemed to have this plan in mind, but the initial proposal only included China, the United States, and Russia. Even after discussions by the White House or the State Department, no results were achieved. Later, between March and May of this year, it was reported that the Japanese ambassador to the United States, Saito, had also proposed that Japan and the United States sign a non-aggression treaty, but it was abandoned due to a lack of support from the United States. Currently, the forces for and against the Pan-Pacific Security Pact are becoming more distinct. Moscow strongly supports it because, after the pact is established, if Japan attacks Soviet Russia, other countries can provide assistance. Japan strongly opposes it because this type of plan is tantamount to encircling Japan, leaving it no room for expansion in the Far East. China is also said to have expressed sympathy for this proposal because it can prevent further Japanese aggression. France is equivocal, not wanting to offend Japan and risk conflicts between French interests in French Indochina and Yunnan Province with Japan, nor willing to reject its Soviet ally. Britain is quite cold, fearing it would harm Anglo-Japanese relations. The most important factor is the attitude of the United States. According to current information, Washington believes that this plan is not yet timely. The United States is currently withdrawing its naval and military forces from the eastern Pacific. President Roosevelt is determined to achieve Philippine independence. Observers believe that only one thing can expedite the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Philippines: the conclusion of a treaty between Japan and the United States, with Britain participating, guaranteeing the independence of the Philippines, similar to Britain's pre-war guarantee of Belgian independence. The United States is currently trying to befriend Japan in order to achieve the goal of Philippine neutrality. Therefore, it is unwilling to discuss a Pan-Pacific Security Treaty that may conflict with Japan and prevent the Philippine neutrality plan from succeeding. Therefore, discussions on the treaty are becoming increasingly inactive. (12th National Telegram)</p>

"In the future, an infantry brigade will have one 'heavy battalion' and three 'light battalions.' Each 'heavy battalion' will be equipped with heavy machine guns and trench mortars. Each 'light battalion' soldier will be equipped with new automatic rifles and small-caliber machine guns for individual use. In addition, the 'Royal Artillery' will be completely mechanized and equipped with 3.7-inch light guns. As for the shovels and other tools used by the engineers, they will be replaced by machines, such as rubber-tired plows and gasoline-powered machine shovels used for road construction. Moreover, the excavation of trenches or the construction of protective works for the artillery, which previously required a week to complete with old tools, can now be completed within an hour using new machines," it said.

<p>To Make Up for Budget Shortfall</p>
<h3 id="e36">Japanese Military Proposes Tax Increase <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Reasons for Opposition from the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The military is demanding that the Ministry of Finance increase taxes from next year to serve as emergency preparedness expenses. It is currently watching what financial plan Finance Minister Fujii has regarding the formulation of next year's budget. This is because the market is quite developed now. Although rural areas are said to be exhausted, it is only a small part. This opportunity should be taken to properly handle the accumulated deficit bonds, promptly correct the financial plan, and establish a permanent financial structure. Therefore, it seems that consideration should be given to increasing tax rates on the wealthy class. However, merely increasing taxes on the wealthy class will provide only a small amount of financial resources. A tax for emergency periods should also be added to military-related industries, but this method will also result in very little government income and may hinder the development of military-related industries that are in the process of development. Therefore, the tax increase implemented to supplement financial resources should be on transportation taxes, postal taxes, and other taxes collected from the entire nation. Otherwise, it will be difficult to achieve the goal. Therefore, the military side advocates reforming the entire tax system as a key plan. (12th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Before the budget for next year is compiled, the military and a part of the House of Peers are advocating for the implementation of tax increases. However, the Ministry of Finance, based on the following viewpoints, believes that it is not yet the time to implement tax increases: (1) Before the crisis of 1935-1936, defense spending and expenditures are expanding, and their future is difficult to predict. Therefore, tax increases cannot be implemented if there is hope for a considerable reduction in expenditures. (2) Judging from the state of the economy, although the future is bright, the overall surplus of national power has not yet been reached. Therefore, setting up a tax increase now will result in the destruction of the budding industries that are developing and thriving, which would be undermining the morale of the people. (3) Even if the so-called emergency income tax is implemented, the amount of income tax obtained will be very small and cannot serve as a powerful source of revenue to replace public bonds. (4) Although a gradual tax increase is necessary, the tax system involves local taxes, so it is necessary to consider the overall situation and conduct a thorough investigation to reduce the burden on rural areas before it can be implemented.

<p>Rome: Austrian Deputy Premier Prince Starhemberg is still living here with 250 Austrian youth students and will stay for two more days. Italian Premier Mussolini went to the province of Rome yesterday and may not meet with Prince Starhemberg again. It is reported that Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg will personally come to Rome in early September and entrusted Prince Starhemberg to hand over a letter to Italian Premier Mussolini. As for the international issues between Italy and Austria, it is said that they must wait until Schuschnigg comes in person before they can be discussed at length. Starhemberg and Mussolini are only considering internal Austrian issues, especially the methods that should be adopted to organize a party army in Austria that imitates the Italian Fascist Party army. Regarding this matter, it is generally believed that Austrian President Miklas entrusted Schuschnigg to organize a new cabinet after the death of Dollfuss because his political tendencies are more moderate than those of Starhemberg.

Last night, the Austrian embassy here only received news from Vienna that the Deputy Premier was planning to come to Rome. Accompanying him was Mr. Monreal, the secretary of the Vienna Fascist Party. As soon as Prince Starhemberg arrived, he went to inspect the Austrian youth encampment in the Vostia area. These people were invited to Austria by the Italian government. Premier Mussolini talked with the Austrian Deputy Premier at the Vostia Youth Camp for a long time. This is the first time that the governments of Rome and Vienna have had direct contact since Dollfuss was assassinated. Both the Austrian Chancellor and Deputy Premier have recently issued declarations regarding the political situation. Starhemberg's declaration was issued yesterday, saying that Germany should be held responsible for the events of July 25, and that he would severely punish the National Socialist Party's terrorism without any leniency. Chancellor Schuschnigg's declaration the day before yesterday stated that the policies of the new Austrian government would be no different from those of former Premier Dollfuss, especially regarding Italian-Austrian relations. These two declarations are the basis for today's talks between the Premier and Prince Starhemberg. Italy is prepared to maintain Austria's independence by all means. This desire is greater now than at any other time. People in Rome believe that they have recently studied how to consolidate Austria's independence, but they have not yet reached a concrete plan. The meeting between the authorities of the two countries today may promote its success. Prince Starhemberg will have dinner with the Premier this evening. (11th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Vienna: Deputy Premier Prince Starhemberg, speaking to the Vienna correspondent of the Paris Evening News, said that Austrian government officials are not paying attention to the restoration of the Habsburg royal family, but they are worried that the National Socialist Party will cause another coup before the end of this year. Since he is the Minister of Public Security, he will prevent it by all means. Regarding the dissolution of the Austrian National Socialist Party's army in Bavaria, Mr. Starhemberg said that he could not say what the impact would be, but he also said that according to reliable sources, this dissolved army of guest nationals can still quickly concentrate on the border. Mr. Starhemberg concluded by saying that the government is currently considering amnesty for the leaders of the Socialist Party so that the party can restore normal relations with the government.

<p>(Berlin) Today, according to reliable sources, German Chancellor Hitler ordered the arrest of Austrian National Socialist Party inspector Habit and other German National Socialist Party leaders in Austria on Saturday. The authorities are keeping the matter a secret, but they do not deny it. At the beginning of last week, Hitler ordered the dissolution of all stormtroopers of the Austrian National Socialist Party and ordered all training centers on the German-Austrian border to be closed. Habit is actually Hitler's representative in Austria and the leader of the Austrian National Socialist Party. He was expelled from Austria by former Austrian Premier Dollfuss in June of last year. Since then, he has been in Munich presiding over anti-Austrian propaganda. Hitler's actions against the Austrian National Socialist Party this time are said to be due to his dissatisfaction with their murder of Dollfuss, which aroused the suspicion of the European powers.

<p>Containing Important Political Significance</p>
<p>Budapest: Premier Gömbös and Foreign Minister Gania are planning to visit Poland in early September, which is of significant political importance, as the Foreign Minister is traveling with the Premier. It is generally believed here that this trip is exploratory in nature. Since the deterioration of German-Austrian relations, Hungary has been uneasy and should make plans for a rainy day. Since the signing of the political and economic agreement between Hungary and Italy on March 17 of this year, although there has been no explicit criticism of Germany, there is a tendency to lean towards Italy. In addition, as the trend goes, everyone is looking north for allies, and Hungary cannot remain aloof. Is this why Dr. Gömbös and Gania are going to Warsaw? Although Poland is a nation that was revived by the Treaty of Versailles, it is inconvenient to openly advocate amending the current treaty. Conversely, Hungary has always called for the restoration of lost territories, and may not be able to reach an understanding with Poland. This is from a political point of view. As for economic issues, both Poland and Hungary are agricultural countries, and they have not been able to trade with each other and achieve success in commerce. (12th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The Soviet Russian government prohibits German people from sending money or goods to German farmers residing in Soviet Russia. German newspapers are greatly angered by this. They claim that according to letters from German farmers in Soviet Russia, famine victims have nothing to eat, leading them to consume rotten corpses and even shoe soles to stave off hunger. Some even eat raw flesh of dead horses. Hundreds of people are dying every day in the city of Kerch. German relief organizations are publicizing the famine situation in Soviet Russia, exaggerating their claims to elicit public compassion. The Soviet Russian government has continuously protested against this kind of propaganda. Germany is now only eight days away from the public referendum, and the anti-Soviet Russian propaganda campaign has restarted at this time. German newspapers are making a big fuss over the fact that gifts cannot be sent to Soviet Russia, all of which is directly related to the vote on the 19th. Germany's intention is to show that the situation in Soviet Russia is far worse than in Germany, thereby enhancing the prestige of the National Socialist Party's politics. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>Japanese Puppet Regime Intensifies Malicious Propaganda</p>
<p>Attempting to Seize the Chinese Eastern Railway by Force</p>
<p>Hirota Abandons Mediation, Negotiations for Purchase Near Collapse</p>
<p>(Moscow) A paper titled "A Naive and Harmful Game" was published in the Soviet government bulletin, stating, "Recently, Japanese and Manchukuo newspapers, following a set goal, have begun a new anti-Soviet movement, attempting to create new conflicts between the Soviet Union and Japan through violent attacks, barbaric anti-Soviet rumors, and other naive methods." The paper dismissed the Japanese and Manchukuo's false claims that the Soviet Red Army crossed the border and that Soviet planes flew over Manchukuo territory, and emphasized that the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway conference is the main factor determining the current Soviet-Japanese relations. The paper continued to comment, "The anti-Soviet movement of Japanese and Manchukuo newspapers is consistent with the new and rude provocations of the Japanese and Manchukuo government authorities. The arrest of Soviet people and illegal searches of Soviet institutions have also reappeared on the Chinese Eastern Railway. In other words, an interesting game has begun, attempting to incite incidents in the eastern border of the Soviet Union. This extremely rude anti-Soviet movement has already exceeded the scope of 'Manchukuo' and the Manchurian question. The [unclear transliteration] newspaper has widely spread this crude story, claiming that the Soviet Union has completed aircraft and chemical bases in Kulun." Japanese newspapers are maliciously distorting the Soviet Union's peaceful policy, and creating a new argument, saying that the Soviet Union's globally recognized peaceful policy, especially its efforts to complete the Eastern Peace Treaty, is aimed at attacking Japan. The Soviet government bulletin interpreted this as, "The purpose of this new argument is clearly to deceive the Japanese people, but they are already deeply aware of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy and can judge it based on the merits of this policy. No one in Europe and America will listen to such a distortion of the Soviet Union's foreign policy. The current anti-Soviet movement of Japanese and Manchukuo newspapers is directly related to the Chinese Eastern Railway conference, and is used as a naive means of threatening the Soviet Union." The bulletin also emphasized that the Soviet Union has proposed selling the Chinese Eastern Railway as a way to ease the situation in the Far East, pointing out that the Japanese side wants to buy the Chinese Eastern Railway at a paltry price, which is no different from trying to seize the railway freely. They do not hesitate to use means to achieve this goal, such as various provocations on the Chinese Eastern Railway during key periods of the Tokyo conference, threatening the Soviet Union, which is one of the means. The bulletin further stated, "The instigators of the anti-Soviet movement must remember that the extremists among them, especially those active in Manchuria, will use this movement to prepare for war." Tanaka, in the "[unclear transliteration]" newspaper in Harbin, said, "If war breaks out, the Chinese Eastern Railway problem will be easily solved." The Soviet government bulletin commented on this, "Tanaka's words are undoubtedly extremely wrong. He uses this extremely difficult and dangerous method as an easy solution. The Japanese and Manchukuo sides, in order to obtain a cheap bargain of several million yen, do not hesitate to plunge the relationship between the two countries into a dangerous situation. This situation has already formed, and this is the basis of the problem. The most barbaric and dangerous anti-Soviet movement expressed in Japanese and Manchukuo newspapers is due to this internal cause. The Soviet Union has shown the greatest goodwill in the Tokyo conference, far more than the Japanese side. If the conference is unsuccessful, it is entirely due to the tactics adopted by the Japanese and Manchukuo sides. The leaders who instigated the attack on the Soviet Union and the unreasonable threat to the Soviet Union must recognize the game they are playing. The whole world understands this as well as the Soviet Union. They will eventually know that completing the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway can only be achieved through free trade between the two parties. Any party that wants to use coercion will not be effective. Japanese politicians who think intelligently should take the opportunity to realize that the newspaper movement cannot control the Tokyo conference, nor can it support their unreasonable claims with naive and harmful provocative actions. The key to the successful outcome of the conference is the sincerity of both parties."</p>
<p>The editor of Pravda also commented as follows, "We are facing a new attempt by the Japanese rulers. They want to threaten the progress of the Chinese Eastern Railway sale conference through various barbaric acts." According to the report of Mr. Rutai, director of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau, the Japanese and Manchukuo sides continue to destroy the railway, and the effort they spend is more than that of the Tokyo conference. The newspaper continued, "The Japanese side uses the real power in Manchuria, which is entirely in their hands, to do its best to destroy the Chinese Eastern Railway, and on the other hand, uses newspapers to create public opinion for forcibly seizing the railway. The provocative methods of the Japanese imperialists to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway have already aroused the anger of the Soviet workers. They have sufficient reason to conclude that the unreasonable anti-Soviet movement of Japanese and Manchukuo newspapers is a preparatory means for attacking the Soviet Union. However, we must warn the instigators of this movement that their provocative attempts will suffer a shameful defeat, no different from the previous attempts. The Japanese rulers will gain nothing from fraud and threats. All that they hope for in this is an empty bubble." (TASS dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway have encountered difficulties in the final stage. Foreign Minister Hirota, in the position of a mediator, proposed a compromise plan to the Soviet Union in order to achieve a satisfactory resolution. The content is quite substantial and he does not intend to propose a specific plan again. Therefore, the Foreign Minister will temporarily not mediate in the sale of the railway. Today, the Soviet and "Manchukuo" sides are quite close to each other, so direct negotiation between the two parties is still the best way. Opportunities for compromise may also be found through the exchange of opinions, and it is also a suitable measure in handling the matter. Next week, Soviet representative Mr. Gazlovsky will begin negotiations with "Manchukuo" representative, Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi. As for the final plan proposed by the Foreign Minister, the Soviet and "Manchukuo" sides are in a situation of forced negotiation. Now that the Foreign Minister has abandoned mediation, in a sense, it is expected that the negotiations will break down. Therefore, the parties concerned are currently studying ways to handle it carefully. (Japanese Union dispatch, 12th)</p>

They often used horse-drawn carriages or trucks to steal machinery, steel, wood, and other items. The company's losses have reached more than 200,000 yuan. However, because the matter was kept very secret, the principal offender, Tasaka, and others have been arrested and detained at the Shakou Police Station since the 5th. A large theft ring organized by company employees is unprecedented, so the facts have been concealed. However, the South Manchuria Railway's top management is extremely panicked.

<p>(Paris) Dr. Valais, a famous French scientist, has recently invented a method to cure jealousy, which is quite effective. Dr. Valais said that although jealousy is a common disease, people often underestimate it, but it is also one of the most difficult diseases to treat. If left untreated, it will gradually lead to all kinds of ugliness and endless troubles. Now, the doctor is willing to treat men and women who suffer from jealousy and are willing to seek medical treatment with his specially made blood secretion agent. Dr. Valais stated that his treatment method is not based on fantasy, and many people have been treated and cured. The treatment period he prescribes is two months, that is, taking a kind of blood secretion and treating the liver at the same time, and then it can be cured. Dr. Valais further said that although jealousy can be eradicated fundamentally, people who suffer from jealousy often do not want to treat the root cause, because jealousy is the most beautiful proof of love.

<p>US Silver Acquisition as National Property</p>
<h3 id="e57">Tendency Towards Expansionary Policies <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Will Issue 80 Million Yuan in Silver Certificates</p>
<p>(Washington) The expansionist faction in Congress and the semi-official government today launched a movement to further devalue the US dollar through the power of the silver nationalization plan in order to achieve expansionist goals. The procedure is roughly as follows: first, further devalue the US dollar; second, the Treasury Department will issue more paper money; third, the President will appoint a committee to deal with this issue and suggest what the value of the US dollar should be, and plan to use silver as much as possible under the nationalization order. The Treasury Department today officially announced that the government only intends to issue silver certificates based on the legal price of 1.29 yuan per dollar based on the silver currently held by the Treasury Department. The silver received under the current nationalization order will be temporarily issued with paper money at a purchase price of 50.1 cents per ounce. There are currently 62 million taels of silver stored in the national treasury, so the significance is that silver certificates worth 80 million yuan will be issued. According to this move, it is also a low-level expansionary policy, because the government only spent 46.9 million yuan to purchase this silver. According to the authorities, the difference is the profit from minting coins. Some observers believe that President Roosevelt and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau disagree on expansionary policies. Treasury officials have tried their best to deny this. Observers said that Roosevelt ordered on July 17 to issue 80 million yuan in silver certificates with silver stored in the national treasury, while the Treasury Secretary often said that the amount issued should be 46.9 million yuan, which is equal to the value of the silver in storage. Although the President and the Treasury Secretary both advocate that the silver price should be 1.29 yuan per ounce, there seems to be a discrepancy in the amount to be issued. This matter has nothing to do with the silver received under the nationalization order. In addition to the 200 million ounces received by the government under the nationalization order, it must purchase another 130 million ounces to be sufficient to form a ratio of three to one with the gold in storage. The Treasury Department further stated that the silver received this time will be used as government assets. Today, the Treasury Department spoke with the press to explain the silver nationalization plan. Some people believe that this speech was intended to eliminate the rumors of expansion. Treasury officials answered questions raised by the press, saying that all silver in the national treasury will be issued in silver coins at a value of 1.29 yuan per ounce. The silver currently received is like purchasing 1 million ounces at 50.16 cents per ounce, which will cost 516,000 yuan. If the government issues 516,000 yuan in silver certificates at the legal silver price, it will require 400,000 ounces of silver. The remaining 600,000 ounces will be stored in the national treasury as government assets. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>

There is also a farmhouse, fully furnished inside, with the size and structure all imitating those commonly seen in Chinese villages, which can show the living conditions of Chinese farmers in rural areas. The agricultural implements on display range from the earliest rough works to the latest structures, all of which are available, to show the gradual communication between Chinese and Western cultures and the impact of European and Western material civilization on the lives of Chinese people. In addition, there is one thing that is greatly admired by the general visitors, that is, a huge model of a temple, the structure of which is made of wood carvings with fine workmanship. In addition, there are porcelain, silk, Gu embroidery, lacquerware, and bronzeware, all of which are sufficient to represent the spirit of a certain kind of craftsmanship.

<p>(Tianjin) Recently, Soviet Russia has been using the British-Russian Trading Company, registered with the British government, to actively dump timber, kerosene, calico, newspapers, agricultural implements, ginseng, deer antlers, and other goods in Tianjin. Because China and Russia have not signed a commercial treaty, they are afraid of our crackdown, so they secretly hired many Chinese people to promote sales. Foreigners do not know and think they are British and American goods, and the sales volume is quite large. The company's general accounting office is located in London to avoid our attention.

<h3 id="e85">The Truth About the Internal Strife in Japanese Political Circles <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Various Factions Rise to Seize Power</p>
<p>The Ugaki Faction Actively Seeks to Form a Cabinet</p>
<p>According to a special correspondent of this port's "Daily News," within the Navy, centered around Colonel Masaki (currently the head of the Ideological Department of the Yokosuka Naval Base), there are five or six hardline members among the captains of the Combined Fleet. These individuals stand in the middle of the military affairs faction and the military command faction within the Navy, proclaiming neutrality while supporting hardline arguments. Recently, the captains jointly submitted a proposal to the top leadership, expressing their opinions on the crisis of 1935-1936, intending to seize the opportunity, similar to the situation within the Army during the Manchurian Incident. The plan for the formation of the Okada Cabinet is rumored to be a conspiracy of the Izawa Takio faction, a leader in the darkness of the political world, manipulated by the new bureaucratic faction. The new bureaucratic faction, including Interior Minister Goto, Foreign Minister Hirota, Justice Minister Ohara, Finance Minister Fujii, Chief Secretary Kawada, and Police Chief Tangasawa, formed the Kokuyukai internally. Using the extraordinary situation as a shield and Prime Minister Okada as a puppet, they maintained good relations with the military, intending to dissolve the Diet and hold new elections to establish new forces in the parliament, so they could dominate the future situation. However, this plan only succeeded partially. Unexpectedly, internal rifts arose due to personnel relations, leading to a confrontational situation. Former Chief Secretary Horikiri, former Police Chief Matsumoto, Police Superintendent-General Fujinuma, and former Chief Secretary Shibata, etc., were greatly dissatisfied. Fujinuma only agreed to stay after repeated persuasion from Interior Minister Goto. Currently, the Okada Cabinet, centered around five cabinet members from Kyushu, such as Tokonami, Goto, Hirota, Yamaji, and Matsuda, has formed the Kyushu Club as a preparatory work for establishing a new party. Among the parliamentarians who have joined the club, there are thirteen members of the Seiyukai and twelve members of the Minseito. However, the Suzuki faction believes that this organization is detrimental to the overall situation, so they are secretly planning to proceed. It is said that Kabayama Sukehide of the Satsuma faction and Adachi Nakano, who is from Kyushu, will also be included. On the other hand, the Governor-General of Korea, Ugaki, also intends to take the opportunity to resign in preparation for engaging in central political activities after his resignation. He also hopes for the dissolution of the Diet and the formation of a new party. It is rumored that he has prepared an election fund of ten million yuan. This huge sum of money was provided by Kansai Zaibatsu, Katsutaro Inahata, Abe Fusajiro, and Masatsune Ogura, etc., and the Katakura Group. The plan for the new party includes the Minseito, the Kokumin Domei, the Tokonami faction, and also has the understanding of the Research Association of the House of Peers and the Koheikai. In the future general election, they want to shatter the Seiyukai's signboard in one fell swoop, gain a majority of seats in the House of Representatives, elect General Ugaki as the party leader, take over the new regime after the Okada transitional cabinet, and undertake the crisis of 1935-1936 with a grand national unity party, realizing the Ugaki Cabinet.</p>
<h3 id="e86">The Upper Reaches of the Yellow River Rise Sharply <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>A Rise of 2.8 Meters Within Twenty Hours</p>
<p>The River Affairs Bureau Telegraphs an Order for Strict Alert Throughout the Entire River</p>
<p>Han Orders County Magistrates Along the River to Reside on the Levees</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: Although the Yellow River's water level increased due to the continuous rain in various provinces last month, it quickly receded. Unexpectedly, the upper reaches have suddenly and violently risen again in recent days. Yesterday morning, the River Affairs Bureau received a telegram from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission stating, "According to the Tongguan telegram, there was a continued rise of 90 centimeters on the ninth. At 8 PM, the water level was 322.95 meters, and the flow rate was 6,960 cubic meters." According to a telegram from the Shaanxi Prefecture Water Level Station at 1:15 AM on the tenth, "At noon on the ninth, the water level was 294.02 meters, an increase of 1.73 meters from the previous level, and the flow rate was 6,500 cubic meters." Based on this, the River Affairs Bureau immediately telegraphed orders to county magistrates along the river and all chief and sub-section chiefs, etc., to take strict precautions. After sending the telegrams, another urgent telegram was received from Shaanxi Prefecture stating, "At 8 AM on the tenth, the water level there was 295.13 meters, an increase of 1.11 meters from noon on the ninth, and the flow rate also increased to 8,000 cubic meters." It is estimated that from noon on the ninth to the morning of the tenth, within twenty hours, the river water in Shaanxi County rose sharply by 2.84 meters. The speed of the increase is alarming. The raging torrents are rushing downstream. It is estimated that they will reach Shandong province by the morning of the twelfth. River Affairs Bureau Director Zhang Lianjia telegraphed Chairman Han and the Civil Affairs and Construction Departments and re-telegraphed to the county magistrates of each county and the chief and sub-section chiefs of the entire river, urging them to take precautions day and night and not to be negligent. Due to the urgency of the situation, the River Affairs Bureau is also working day and night, sending telegrams at any time to instruct matters to avoid accidents. The River Affairs Bureau telegraphed to Chairman Han, "To the esteemed Chairman Han Jun of the Shandong Provincial Government in Qingdao: We have investigated that the river water in this province has been rising continuously in recent days, and many sections have already reached full capacity. We were taking precautions when we received a telegram from the Shaanxi Prefecture Hydrological Station stating that there was a sharp rise of 2.84 meters from noon to the morning. It is estimated that it will reach Shandong province early in the morning. The water is vast, and the work situation is tight. In addition to ordering all sections to take proper precautions day and night and separately telegraphing to the county magistrates of each county along the river to assist at any time to avoid negligence, we respectfully report. River Affairs Bureau Director Zhang Lianjia kowtows in respect." After receiving the telegram, Han immediately telegraphed Secretary-General Zhang Shaotang of the Provincial Government, separately telegraphing to the county magistrates of twenty-two counties along the river: Heze, Puyang, Fanxian, Shouzhang, Yanggu, Yuncheng, Juan Cheng, Dong'a, Pingyin, Feicheng, Licheng, Qihe, Changqing, Zhangqiu, Jiyang, Qidong Huimin, Qingcheng, Putai, Dongping, Lijin, Binzhou, etc., ordering them to move to the levees by a deadline to supervise the work and rescue. Civil Affairs Department Head Li Shuchun also sent the same telegram last night to the counties along the river, ordering them to move to the levees to supervise the work.</p>
<p>As for the Yellow River water level, according to a telegram from Shaanxi County, at 8 PM on the tenth, the water level dropped by 10 centimeters, the water level was 295.03 meters, and the flow rate was around 8,000 cubic meters. The water level is still very vast and turbulent. Jinan Mayor Wen Cheng</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>He strongly believed that Luokou protected Jinan. The lives and property of 400,000 Chinese and foreign residents were of great importance. Yesterday, he went to inspect the upper and lower sections of Luokou in the rain. He returned that evening and immediately prepared for rescue works. This morning (the eleventh) at about 8:00 AM, he convened a meeting in the city government with Wei Echen, the Director of the Public Security Bureau of the Northeast Township, and the heads of various towns in Luokou to discuss matters related to river defense. It is reported that it has been decided to build more sheds along the coast of Luokou to facilitate day and night defense and ensure safety, and rescue materials will be transported to the construction site by trucks. More than 20 engineers will be dispatched to assist the work, and Liu Hongxiang, a city government staff member, will be sent to guide and supervise and report at any time. The Luokou rescue worksite extends from Yangzhuang in the west to Gajia Gou in the east. It will be fully deployed tonight. It is reported that he will also personally supervise tomorrow (the twelfth).</p>
<p>Today, the upper reaches of the Yellow River in the province rose slightly, while the middle and lower reaches remained stable. The water levels are as follows: Li Sheng Tun water level: 58.12 meters, up 2.9 centimeters; Guanzhuang water level: 35.031 meters, up 0.3 centimeters; Luokou water level: 29.45 meters, down 0.6 centimeters; Xiezhiwan water level: 18.47 meters, down 2 centimeters; Dama Jia water level: 14 meters, down 3 centimeters.</p>
<p>Also, in Dongping County, there are no official dikes for river defense, only a small embankment about thirty miles long. A few days ago, due to the rising river water, the civilian embankment in Shentun was thin and had collapsed in places. Dongping County Magistrate Zhang Zhixi believed that if there was any negligence in this area, Dong'a, Pingyin, and Shouzhang counties would be the first to be affected. He telegraphed the provincial government, requesting approval to use the county's Third Section local public funds for rescue protection. The Ministry of Finance was instructed to jointly review the request with the River Affairs Bureau. Later, the Ministry of Finance joined the review. While the review was in progress, the county magistrate telegraphed again, stating that the work situation was urgent and requesting approval to transfer funds from the Huaqiao donations stored locally for warehouse use to meet the urgent needs. Dong Nianzhou, section chief of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and Du Zhaotian, director of the River Affairs Bureau, discussed this matter in the Ministry of Civil Affairs today and decided to reply to the county, approving the allocation of 5,000 yuan from the donations of overseas Chinese for application. A letter was sent to the Ministry of Finance, and a report was submitted to the Provincial Government for record. (The Eleventh)</p>

<h3 id="e88">The Government of the Dutch East Indies Restricts Porcelain Imports <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Delegation Lodges a Serious Protest</p>
<p>The Future of the Meeting is Likely to Fall into a Stalemate</p>
<p>Batavia Special Dispatch: The economic control implemented by the Dutch government on the Dutch East Indies due to the dumping of Japanese goods, and the subsequent promulgation of foreign goods import restriction laws, have severely impacted Japanese goods. The Japanese side has been forced to request a one-day Dutch-Japanese meeting, hoping to ease the Dutch attitude towards Japan. However, since the opening of the meeting, nearly two months have passed. Although there was once a slight development in the middle due to the discussion of expert review, it soon returned to obscurity. There is still no slightest approach between the two sides' opinions. However, one more thing has happened recently that is worthy of our attention, that is, after the Dutch East Indies government's implementation of the cotton fabric import restriction law, it suddenly announced a three-month restriction on porcelain imports. After this news was released, the Japanese side was greatly shocked, because the Japanese goods occupy a large part of the Dutch East Indies' porcelain market. If this law is implemented, it is equivalent to giving Japan another extremely large blow. Therefore, the Japanese delegation attending the Dutch-Japanese meeting, upon learning of this, the chief representative Nagaoka immediately lodged a strong protest to the Dutch East Indies government.</p>
<p>The main idea of the Japanese protest letter is roughly: "There is a prior agreement between the Japanese and Dutch governments that the implementation of the Dutch East Indies' restriction law on 56 kinds of commodities must be postponed during the Dutch-Japanese meeting. This time, the Dutch side suddenly issued a porcelain import restriction order without any prior statement, violating the above-mentioned agreement. This fact violates international practice, and its reasons are extremely illegal. If this is the case, it is no longer known whether the Dutch side has the sincerity to continue the meeting. Based on friendly relations, but taking such measures in the meeting, it is really intolerable in terms of normal internationalism concepts and etiquette. Hereafter, it is hoped that the Dutch East Indies side will make every effort to seek understanding." From the wording of the above protest, we can see the strong attitude of the Japanese side. If the Dutch side does not give way, it is really difficult to predict whether the Dutch-Japanese meeting can continue to be held in the future.</p>
<p>According to a Tokyo dispatch on July 26, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its opinion in the form of a talk regarding the Dutch East Indies government's issuance of a restriction on the import of ceramics, saying that once the official report is received and the situation is clarified, the Japanese government will demand the Dutch side's reflection, and a decision has already been made regarding appropriate measures for the aftermath. However, it is unknown whether the so-called "determination of appropriate measures" of the Japanese government is only a kind of false intimidation or whether there is really a so-called method. However, judging from the general trend, Dutch East Indies-Japanese merchants have no choice but to make passive transportation shutdowns. As for the Japanese authorities being willing to bet on the breakdown of the meeting, it seems to be an expected thing.</p>
<p>As for the Dutch East Indies government's sudden announcement of a porcelain import restriction order this time, although it has a demonstrative nature towards Japan, its inside story is not without cause. According to news from the Dutch East Indies Economic Department, not long ago, fourteen Japanese porcelain merchants in the Dutch East Indies organized a company with extremely ambitious goals. The company has a close relationship with the Japanese Porcelain Exporters Association and intends to dominate the entire Dutch East Indies porcelain market. The company also invited several Chinese merchants and five European merchants to participate and stipulated the import volume and prices of each merchant, etc. This approach will inevitably have a great impact on the local porcelain industry, so the Dutch East Indies authorities had no choice but to take this emergency measure. If this statement is accurate, then the restriction of Japanese porcelain imports is still the Japanese's own fault. What fault can one find with others? Moreover, the quota issued by the Dutch East Indies government is 100% of last year's import volume, and it has not absolutely prohibited the import of Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Currently, Japanese goods do occupy a large part of the porcelain sold in the Dutch East Indies market, but the porcelain produced in Jiangxi and Shantou in our country is also quite a lot. According to today's telegraphic news, Japanese porcelain merchants are very indignant at the Dutch East Indies' porcelain import restriction law and have already stopped shipping. This is indeed an excellent opportunity for our country's porcelain industry to develop in the Dutch East Indies. Our country's porcelain merchants should not let this opportunity pass by.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Unprecedentedly Severe Drought in Southern Anhui <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Only Seen Once in Eighty Years</p>
<p>Farmers Swarm Out to Seek Food</p>
<p>Wuhu Communication: The severe drought in various counties in southern Anhui has now reached an irremediable point. The crops have withered, and the beans and grains have turned green. Millions of acres of farmland in Nanling, Wuwei, Tongcheng, and Chaoxian counties can be burned and set ablaze. The elders say that the disaster situation is comparable to the Xianfeng Sixth Year of the Qing Dynasty. It is truly a catastrophe only seen once in eighty years. In towns and villages in various counties, those who have no harvest have already had their entire families seeking food. Those with a little accumulated grain can hardly provide a full meal for many people. Therefore, those who were being fed have been transformed into food seekers in an instant. As the number of food seekers increases day by day, the scope is also becoming wider and wider. In Wuhu, refugees from various counties have been passing through the area every day recently. It is now the autumn harvest season, but there is such a tragic situation. If the harsh winter and barren spring arrive, it will be even more unthinkable. Although the rice price in Wuhu has been suppressed and stabilized by the official and rice industry groups at no more than ten yuan per stone and exports are prohibited, rice merchants hoard and speculate, selling at high prices, still above twelve yuan per stone. A small amount of new grain is sold at around eight yuan. The commissioner's office has recently issued a notice to investigate and prohibit such practices. If anyone deliberately violates the order or acts in defiance, they will be severely punished once discovered. The Commissioner's Office, in view of the tragic situation of the displacement of disaster victims in Wuwei, Nanling, and other counties, and upon receiving the request of representatives of disaster victims from various counties, has distributed emergency relief and has submitted a report to the provincial government, the Relief Association, and the Three-Province Bandit Suppression Headquarters, requesting assistance.

<h3 id="e90">Attention Songjiang Residents Regarding the Land Tax Corruption Case <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Huanzhi Petitions Chairman for Thorough Investigation and Strict Punishment</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaosheng Requests Attention to Ye Zongcheng's Safety</p>
<p>Songjiang Dispatch: Zhang Huanzhi, a citizen of this county, yesterday petitioned Chairman Chen for a thorough investigation and strict punishment regarding the land tax corruption case. The original petition stated, "Jin Tigan, the Magistrate of Songjiang County, Che Zhao, the Chief of the Finance Section, and Ye Zongcheng, the Director of the Tax Collection Office, have jointly embezzled a substantial amount of land tax. I petition for an investigation and punishment to deter corruption. The conversion of land tax to grain transport in this county began in the 18th year of the Republic [1929]. At that time, Che Zhao was the Director of the Finance Bureau, She Yingduo was the Chief of the Collection Section, and Ye Zongcheng was the Director of the First Land Tax Collection Office (formerly known as the Huating Grain Depot, also known as the East Depot). The registration and issuance of tax bills were handled by these two individuals. The East Depot was responsible for 34,639 mu of land north of the Pu River, with a converted grain transport quota of 3,260 shi and some odd amounts. All landholders have cleared their payments annually. South of the Pu River, there were 84,960 mu of land, with a converted grain transport quota of 7,039 shi and some odd amounts. Not all landholders fully complied with the payment, especially those in coastal villages who resisted due to poor soil quality and inability to pay. This situation was addressed by Shen Bingchen, Xiao Zengrong, and Shen Binde, who served as Bureau Chiefs, but remained unresolved. Last year in April, Magistrate Jin arrived in Songjiang, and the Finance Bureau was merged. Che Zhao was retained as the Chief of the Finance Section because he was familiar with the land tax situation during the tenures of She and the two Shens. In September of that year, Magistrate Jin, taking advantage of the resistance to paying the converted grain transport quota by landholders in coastal villages, colluded with Chief Che and Director Ye, falsely claiming that land north of the Pu River was actually south of it. They reported to the Provincial Finance Department, stating that the grain transport quota south of the Pu River was over 10,000 shi (actually over 7,000 shi) and that no revenue had been collected for four years (actually, over 100,000 yuan had been collected over the years). They requested a 60% reduction from the assessed amount, effectively collecting only 40%, and sought to use the surplus from the 22nd year to offset the 18th year. In October, the Finance Department approved the request with Directive No. 79. They deducted the originally converted grain transport of over 10,000 shi from the actual assessed amount in the autumn censuses of the 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st years. The actual collected amount for the 22nd year was then listed as 40% of the converted grain transport quota for the 18th year, amounting to over 4,000 shi. They filled out forms and reported this to both the Provincial Finance Department and the Jiangsu Education Expenses Management Office. In May of this year, Magistrate Jin and Chief Che ordered the map compilers and Director Ye to create and issue registers as before, without complying with the Provincial directive to reduce the converted grain transport quota to 40%. These registers were stamped and stored in the East Depot. Magistrate Jin and Chief Che, by feigning a reduction, were not only embezzling over 100,000 yuan of the already collected but not remitted converted grain transport quota from the north of the Pu River since the 18th year, but also attempting to embezzle the 60% tax reduction granted for the 22nd and 23rd years. Their deception of superiors and harm to the country and its people is clearly evident. This inside story was reported by citizen Lu Boxin to the County Party Headquarters in June of this year. Director Ye then resigned on his own initiative. On the first day of last month, Magistrate Jin appointed Yang Yunwen as Ye's successor to ease the tension and find a way to cover up the matter. This was discovered by Zhu Zhaosheng, the Director of the County Education Bureau, who, concerned about the educational funds, petitioned the County Government to investigate. As a result, Magistrate Jin had no choice but to place Ye under supervision, using him as a scapegoat, and ordered Ye to confess in order to reduce his own crime of concealment. At the same time, he petitioned the Provincial Finance Department to correct the portion of the converted grain transport from the north of the Pu River, stating that it was not within the scope of the original reduction plan. At the beginning of this month, he ordered the map compilers in the south of the Pu River to re-create the collection registers for the 23rd year, reducing the converted grain transport quota to 40%. The contradictions and private corruption are glaring. Before the case was discovered, they included the north of the Pu River in the list of surplus collections. After the case was discovered, they excluded the north of the Pu River from the surplus collections. They treated national taxes as a source of profit, the Finance Department as a puppet, official documents as a game, and government orders as worthless rags. The grace of the provincial government in caring for the people and reducing taxes was turned into a tool for these individuals to profit from. Previous Directors of the Finance Bureau never underreported even a single cent of the actual collected and uncollected amounts. After Magistrate Jin deceptively obtained approval from the Finance Department, he deducted over 10,000 shi of converted grain transport from the old arrears of land tax from the 18th to the 21st years, in order to achieve his embezzlement goal. When the inside story was revealed, he shifted the blame to Director Ye to cover his own tracks. I ask, who was the one who deceptively reported the surplus collection? Since the Finance Bureau was merged, the County Government has been the competent authority for the county's finances. Even if Magistrate Jin was not familiar with the situation, Chief Che was an expert in handling the conversion of grain transport. How could he not know how many shi were north of the Pu River and how many mu were south of it? Since over 10,000 shi of converted grain transport from the East Depot was approved for reduction and surplus collection by Directive No. 79, the tax money overcollected by Director Ye and others should be fully refunded. As a Party member and a lawyer, Huanzhi could not bear to see the Provincial directive on tax reduction and surplus collection be used to enrich corrupt officials. Therefore, he published a notice in the newspaper to inform all landholders in the north and south of the Pu River to present their stamped receipts for the converted grain transport from the 18th to the 21st years as soon as possible, so that evidence of Director Ye and others' embezzlement of tax money could be collected and reported truthfully. Since the announcement was made, only six days have passed, but numerous landholders have come to register, nearly wearing out the threshold. However, on the 10th of this month, I received a letter No. 668 from the Songjiang County Government, which stated, 'To whom it may concern, upon reading the notice published in the Songjiang Public News, concerning your announcement to landholders (newspaper attached), it does not conform to the facts. It has been verified that the portion of converted grain transport north of the Pu River is not within the scope of the original plan approved for tax reduction and surplus collection last year. Enclosed is Announcement No. 104 regarding this case for your reference, in order to avoid misunderstandings,' etc. This announcement was issued on August 9th of this year, stating that in June of this year, it was discovered that former Director Ye collected the full amount of the converted grain transport from the south of the Pu River, and also included the north of the Pu River in the surplus collection. The former Director's concealment was truly deserving of punishment, etc. But while Director Ye deserves punishment, do Magistrate Jin and Chief Che deserve no punishment? According to the old arrears of land tax tables and the final accounts for the 22nd year and the budget for the 23rd year, which Magistrate Jin submitted to the Provincial Finance Department and the Provincial Education Expenses Management Office, over 10,000 shi of converted grain transport was deducted from the 18th to the 21st years, and over 4,000 shi of converted grain transport was surplus collected in the 22nd and 23rd years. Therefore, it is beyond doubt that the converted grain transport from both the north and south of the Pu River was within the scope of tax reduction and surplus collection. Land tax collection is of utmost importance, especially since the converted grain transport north of the Pu River totals 3,260 shi. The competent authority should not be allowed to conceal and jointly embezzle it. Therefore, I petition your Excellency to investigate and punish them strictly in order to deter corruption and emphasize taxation. In addition to submitting this separately to the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, I respectfully submit it to Chen, the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government." Respectfully submitted by Zhang Huanzhi, a citizen of Songjiang.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhu Zhaosheng, the Director of the County Education Bureau, believes that Ye Zongcheng, who is in custody, is old and ill, and that an accident would have serious consequences. He sent a special telegram to the province requesting the County Magistrate to pay close attention. The original telegram is as follows: "To Chen, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang, and Zhao, Director of the Provincial Finance Department, for your review: Ye Zongcheng, the Director of the First Land Tax Collection Office in Songjiang, has defaulted on taxes and embezzled converted grain transport, amounting to a large sum. The County Party Headquarters and this Bureau have reported the matter, and the County Government has placed him under supervision. However, the Director is old, ill, and deeply addicted to opium. It is said that during his custody, his addiction triggered asthma, and he is on the verge of death. This case is of great importance and will involve many others. If the Director dies in custody, there will be no living witness to the accomplices in the corruption, and the large sum of public funds will be impossible to recover. Therefore, I urgently request that you telegraph the County Magistrate of Songjiang to pay attention to his life's safety, so that he can be treated for his addiction while in custody (according to the new regulations, he should be registered), and prevent evil-doers from plotting his death. This would be fortunate for the overall situation. Zhu Zhaosheng, Director of the Songjiang County Education Bureau, respectfully implores." (12th)</p>
<h3 id="e91">All Salt Merchants in Bengbu Suspend Business <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Banks Refuse to Terminate Loan Agreements for Transportation Permits</p>
<p>The Government Temporarily Sells Salt for Civilian Consumption</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: The salt market here has always been freely traded, often exhibiting a chaotic appearance. Last autumn, Miao Qiujie, the Salt Commissioner of Lianghuai, changed it to a rotational sales system, with quotas drawn by lot. At that time, banks such as the China Transportation Bank and the Shanghai Bank in Shanghai, seeing the security of the salt business, pre-paid field taxes of up to 900,000 shi to the salt authorities. They loaned transportation permits to salt merchants in Bengbu, collecting substantial profits (there are thirty-six licensed salt merchants operating in Bengbu, who have jointly formed a Huai Salt Sales Office). The banks and the merchants agreed on an interest rate of 1%, and the banks also lent money to river salt merchants in Bengbu, limited to 250,000 shi (because the pre-paid field taxes of 900,000 shi were sufficient to cover the annual sales on both sides of the Huai River in northern Anhui and Henan), in order to avoid affecting the sales of vehicle-transported salt. This agreement has now lasted for a year. River salt sales have reached 650,000 shi. Recently, the Salt Commissioner of Lianghuai planned to restore the free trade system starting from September 1st. The vehicle-transported salt merchants, due to the impact of river salt sales on their stockpiled salt last year, have not yet started sales. The intangible loss per shi, compounded by the new taxes, is more than one yuan higher. Now that the government is restoring the old system, they will inevitably suffer from the encroachment of new salt, and the losses will be even greater. Last month, they jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai banks concerned, requesting the termination of the agreements or a reduction in interest rates in order to maintain their capital. After several exchanges of letters and telegrams, the Shanghai banks ultimately refused. In order to express their determination, the merchants have suspended business since the 6th of this month. Currently, the salt stores in the port have about 20,000 shi of salt, which is only sufficient to meet the needs of the people in twenty-three counties in northern Anhui and eastern Henan for ten days. If this is not resolved for a long time, there will be a shortage of salt. Huang Jingwu, the commissioner of the Bengbu Salt Tax Collection Office, has come forward to mediate. Before a decision is made by both parties, the government will temporarily release some packages of stockpiled salt for sale in order to maintain the food supply for the people. The salt money will be temporarily stored in the Central Bank. The merchants believe that this is acceptable, but the banks have not yet agreed. The situation is very serious.

<h3 id="e92">Additional Problems Arise in the Songjiang Land Tax Corruption Case <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Ye Zongcheng, the Director of the First Land Tax Collection Office in this county, was involved in the land tax conversion corruption case. The County Government is currently supervising the new Director, Yang Yunwen, in conducting a thorough investigation. However, before one wave subsides, another arises. It is now reported that residents such as Xu Shiqi hold collection notices for the 23rd year and have filed a complaint with the Provincial Department. The County Government believes that these notices are kept by the Collection Office and have not yet been issued to the landholders. How did Xu and others obtain them? A strict investigation is underway. At the same time, Director Yang has also telegraphed the Province to report a theft.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Changes to Patrol Officers in the Public Security Bureau <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>After assuming office, He Yongyao, the Director of the Public Security Bureau in this county, ordered all branch directors and patrol officers under his jurisdiction to continue their duties as usual. However, recently, there have been complaints in various districts. After sending personnel to investigate secretly, it was deemed necessary to make changes. Yesterday, an order was issued for a large-scale reshuffle. Wang Hao, the director of the Fengjing Second Branch, was approved to resign, and Jiang Mingwei was appointed as his successor. Tang Shao was appointed to Sijing, Zhu Deming to Yexie, and Hua Shikang to Tianmashan. In the four police stations in the city, in addition to the patrol officer Lang Xianong, who was newly appointed to the Second Police Station, Liu Jiancheng was now appointed as the patrol officer of the First District, Zheng Han as the patrol officer of the Fourth District, and Lu Jianfen as the patrol officer of the Third District. All of them took office today. Internally, Li Zehuan, the Chief of the Second Section, has been transferred to Caojing as a patrol officer. The vacancy was filled by Zhang Polang, the administrator of the police training school. Yang Jingjiang, the supervising officer, was dismissed.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Dispute Over Rickshaw Licenses in Wuxi City and Countryside <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>There are currently over 2,200 rickshaws in this city, crowding the city walls and competing for business, resulting in an oversupply and severely affecting the rickshaw business. After the completion of the Xiyi Provincial Highway, Xin Genji, the owner of a rickshaw company, petitioned for the issuance of additional rickshaw licenses in accordance with regulations in order to operate on that road. However, the authorities, believing that the existing vehicles already constituted an oversupply, did not issue a single license, making it difficult to hire rickshaws in rural areas. Now, Xin Genji argues that among the existing 2,200 rickshaws, over 700 were issued by the Municipal Board of Directors before the ninth year of the Republic [1920], and no security deposit was required at that time, which is inconsistent with the current regulations. Given the current oversupply of vehicles in the city, vehicles without security deposits can be banned uniformly. At the same time, rickshaw licenses for highways such as Xiyi and Xicheng can be issued separately in accordance with the established regulations, so that the supply and demand of rickshaws in the city and countryside can be balanced, maintaining the livelihood of the rickshaw business. Therefore, he specially petitioned the County Construction Bureau for review. However, the matter was learned by the Rickshaw Guild, which, fearing that the vehicles without security deposits would be banned by the authorities, was greatly alarmed. Yesterday, they convened a meeting of the executive committee and decided to convene a general meeting of members on the 13th of this month to discuss countermeasures.</p>

<p>Yan Shenyu, the Magistrate of this county, has been diligent and capable in his work since taking office over a year ago, achieving remarkable results. When the Gu Renfa and Li Shuyun case occurred this spring, he once requested to resign, but it was not approved. The local community was deeply fortunate. However, recently, Mr. Yan suddenly claimed that his body was weak and his energy was insufficient, and that he was unable to handle the heavy workload. A few days ago, he went to the Provincial Department to personally request Yu Minting, the Director, to resign. Director Yu sincerely persuaded him to stay and encouraged him. However, after Yan returned to Wuxi, he formally submitted a petition to the Provincial Department yesterday, requesting approval to resign. Upon hearing the news, various circles in the local community have telegraphed the province one after another, requesting that he be retained.</p>

<p>Because it had not obtained the approval of the Provincial Department, the Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company reduced its fares without authorization, resulting in backlash from private car businesses. At 8:00 a.m. on the 11th, drivers drove their private cars to the No. 1 Bridge on the Xicheng Road and blocked the road, preventing Xicheng buses from passing, causing a great uproar. The police station sent police to the scene to maintain order and restore traffic. The drivers then went to the local authorities to petition for relief and fair treatment. Zhang Fulin, the Director of the Construction Bureau, summoned Sun Chenchu, the manager of the Xicheng Company, and Cao Xuemei, Yang Zhaoqing, and Zhang Shaoyan, representatives of the private car business, to the bureau for a discussion. As a result, (1) The Xicheng Company's reduction in fares will not be implemented before it receives approval from the Provincial Department. (2) Private car owners must not engage in any further actions that disrupt traffic. Cao Xuemei and other representatives of the private car owners then made three verbal requests: 1. Requesting a reduction in road maintenance fees. 2. Requesting the restoration of the previous parking locations. 3. Before the fare reduction is implemented, the bus tickets should be stamped, and Sun Yizhuo, the Director of the Vehicle Management Office, will be responsible for inspection to prevent fraud. Director Zhang stated that the first two requests were difficult to fulfill in the current situation, but the third request would be granted. At the same time, the private car owners issued a declaration stating the circumstances of the large buses damaging the private car businesses. Given this conflict, it is unknown how it will be resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e98">The Declining Lianghuai Salt Industry in Zhenjiang <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Lianghuai salt industry is the main business in northern Jiangsu. Its annual production accounts for more than 40% of the country. Almost everyone along the coast relies on this for a living. According to statistics, the number of salt farmers reaches more than one million, and the number of salt workers is even double that. Therefore, no less than three million people in northern Jiangsu rely on Huai salt for their livelihoods. However, in recent years, it has been declining. Although the authorities have been determined to rectify it, the fundamental issues have not been resolved. In particular, the people in the salt areas have weak self-defense capabilities, heavy and miscellaneous taxes, and difficult transportation routes, which are the main reasons for their decline. Therefore, from spring to now this year, it is reported that only 5 million dan of salt have been produced and only 1.2 million dan have been sold. Compared with the 18th year of the Republic (the golden age), it has fallen by more than half. Exploring the reasons, there are only three: (1) There are many bandits in the coastal salt areas, and the salt farmers have weak self-defense capabilities. The salt they boil and dry is often robbed. What is more, the unemployed salt farmers in recent years, every time they see salt being dried in the summer and autumn, form groups of dozens and either rob or destroy it (by drawing seawater into the ponds). These are the so-called salt smugglers. Salt farmers have to guard against bandits from the outside and smugglers from the inside. Their mental suffering is extreme. If they are robbed by bandits and smugglers, their hard work for a year will be in vain, and their livelihood for the whole year will be cut off. Therefore, due to the lack of security for salt farmers, many abandon this industry and seek other ways. (2) Among the salt areas of Lianghuai, in addition to the national tax levied by the central government, various salt affairs agencies and local agencies also levy heavy taxes, such as stove tax, pot tax, and levee maintenance fees. The number of items is too numerous to mention. Although the Lianghuai Salt Transportation Office planned to reduce them last year, it was only empty talk. The livelihood of salt farmers is already difficult to maintain, and they still have to respond to these exorbitant taxes. They cannot afford it, but if they are forced to pay, they will only tend to change their careers. (3) After the salt products are produced in the production area, they must be transported out for sale. There are three routes: one is by vehicle, that is, from Banpu, take the Longhai train and transport it to various lead lands in Anhui and Henan; one is by sea, that is, from Dabao in Haizhou, take a sea ship, go out to the sea, enter Wusongkou, and go upstream along the Yangtze River to Shierwei to unload, then change to sailboats and transport it to various lead lands in the Yangtze River; one is by river, that is, from Xiba Town in Qingjiangpu, use sailboats to go out of Hongze Lake, pass through Changhuai and reach Bengbu, Linhuai Pass and other places, and transport it to Anhui, Henan, Hubei and other provinces. Recently, only the vehicle transportation route is smooth. Sea transportation has caused great disputes. According to the old practice, after being transported into the Yangtze River by sea ships, they must be unloaded at Shierwei in Yangzhou and changed to sailboats. Now, in order to facilitate transportation, the authorities plan to use ships to transport them all the way to Shierwei for unloading. Therefore, tens of thousands of salt workers in Shierwei who rely on sailing for their livelihoods have risen up in opposition and petitioned the central government to fight for their survival. Therefore, in effect, sea transportation has been suspended from spring to now. As for the river transportation route to Hongze Lake, which is a major route, it has long been occupied by bandits, and salt merchants regard it as a dangerous place, so river transportation is only nominal. What is more, in recent years, because Huai salt is difficult to transport and there is a shortage of salt in the various lead lands of the Yangtze River and Huai River, they have purchased refined salt to replace it. Because refined salt companies have the opportunity to take advantage of, they are all competing to produce it to meet the demand, so although Huai salt is sometimes transported to the lead lands by vehicle, the market is full of refined salt to compete with it, and the outcome is already inevitable. To sum up the above, the reduction in Huai salt production this year is worrying, but looking to the future, it is even more worrying. The livelihood of salt farmers has become a problem, and the state's tax revenue is also short, and the impact is both deep and significant. I have described the actual situation to share with readers.</p>

<p>The first small vegetable market in the city has been completed and implemented on the first of this month. All vendors in the city will be moved to the market to do business. Violators will be detained and fined by the Public Security Bureau. Unexpectedly, there are many vendors and the market is not enough to accommodate them, and business is extremely deserted after entering the market. Suddenly, at about 2 pm yesterday, hundreds of vendors gathered and went to the county to petition. Traffic was cut off for a while. Everyone knelt on the ground and asked to pass through the streets. Zhou Yuchang, the third section chief of the county government, came out to persuade and promised that before the establishment of the second and third vegetable markets, they would be allowed to sell on the back street. After that, they happily dispersed. Another peddler Liu Gu Chang and Zhou Gan Xing and others went to the county public security bureau to petition. There was a conflict in language. The bureau beaten and detained nine peddlers including Xu Guobin by the police. The whole body went to the county government to petition again. The county government immediately sent police to the bureau and released Xu Guobin and others to the government. The chaos subsided.</p>

<p>The villages of Punan Township and Jianxiao River Shang Datong and others are the worst hit by the drought in Xiaoshan County. The county government has now sent personnel to conduct on-site investigations. A total of 1,600 mu of farmland has been withered. Even if it rains, it cannot be remedied. The disaster is serious and the best in the county. As the water source has dried up, residents must also fetch drinking water from several miles away. The general farmers cry relative to each other, which is extremely painful.</p>

<p>This county is experiencing a drought unprecedented in decades, with yellow dust and white grass, scarcely any green to be seen. Ponds and pools are completely dry, and no late rice can be harvested. Rice prices have already risen from two dou per yuan to less than one dou, while hoarders continue to speculate and transport grain out of the area. The suffering of the common people is unbearable to witness. Various public organizations, deeply saddened by the situation, held a meeting at the county government office at noon on the 7th to discuss relief measures. They decided to establish a Drought Relief Committee, comprising representatives from various public organizations, schools, and district chiefs as ex officio members. Thirty-six people, including Fei Yongzhang, Yang Licuo, and Kong Huaqing, were elected as committee members. Furthermore, eleven individuals from the county government, the Party headquarters, and the Red Swastika Society were mutually elected as standing committee members. Subsequently, Battalion Commander Ruan Zijing, stationed in Yun, proposed a ban on rice and grain transportation out of the river area starting from the 8th, which was unanimously approved. It was also agreed that the inaugural meeting of the Drought Relief Committee would be held at the Red Swastika Society on the 8th.</p>

<p>Rice Shortage Estimated at Around Ten Million Piculs, Panic Expected by Next Spring</p>
<p>Soaring Rice Prices Are the Result of Rice Merchants' Speculation</p>
<p>Tax-Exempt Import of Foreign Rice Difficult to Implement Immediately</p>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, this summer, various parts of the world have suffered from floods and droughts, resulting in poor harvests. Both northern and southern provinces of China have also encountered difficulties, and grain shortages are inevitable. Consequently, merchants and influential figures in the money lending industry in this city have been eagerly ordering foreign rice to profit from the situation. The Municipal Grain Management Committee has even approved a resolution to allow merchants to order forward foreign rice imports under bond to alleviate the domestic grain panic. Yesterday, a reporter from Shen Shi News Agency visited Mr. Wu Huanru, the head of the Second Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, who provided detailed information on the subsequent relief efforts for the rice shortage and the planned measures to regulate the situation as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e110">Holding Registration of Imported Foreign Rice <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Wu, the severe drought this summer has led to poor harvests in various regions, causing a shortage of rice. It is inevitable to rely on foreign rice imports for relief. However, the import of foreign rice should aim to meet the needs of the inland areas and should not be unrestricted. Now merchants are ordering foreign rice as a source of profit, placing large-scale advance orders. Even the money lending industry is investing huge amounts of capital in the grain business, waiting for favorable prices to sell. If the quantities ordered are indeed needed by consumers, there is no problem. Otherwise, if the goods cannot be sold in the future and rice prices fall, the losses may be small, but the outflow of money will affect the national economy, which would be unimaginable. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau has now decided to instruct the Grains and Cereals Trade Association that all merchants ordering foreign rice must first register with the Social Affairs Bureau for statistical purposes. Once imports reach a certain limit, efforts can be made to stop operations to prevent merchants from losing money.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Harvest Shortfall Not as Severe as Anticipated <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The rice-producing provinces in Jiangnan have all suffered from unprecedented droughts. Rice merchants are hoarding rice, hoping to profit from the speculation. The rice price has already risen to above the 13-yuan limit price, and the future remains uncertain. However, the harvest shortfall in various provinces is not as severe as anticipated. The most severely affected area is Zhejiang Province, with an estimated harvest of only about 30% of a normal year. However, Zhejiang's grain supply has always been insufficient, and the drought will undoubtedly exacerbate the situation. The estimated grain shortage for the year is below ten million piculs. In Jiangsu, there are still areas with good harvests in the Jiangbei region, while the Jiangnan region has a limited shortage, with a maximum shortage of about two to three million piculs. Southern Anhui can still be self-sufficient, while the disaster in northern Anhui is more severe. According to statistics from the Jiangxi Grain Administration, the province has a shortage of about one million piculs. Hunan and Hubei are generally offsetting each other. If the autumn grains, such as buckwheat, taro, corn, millet, sorghum, can have good harvests, and if wheat can be planted effectively next spring with favorable weather conditions, the rice shortage can be compensated for. Moreover, relatively well-off families in rural areas often hoard rice for many years to prepare for famine. Based on the above observations, although there is a rice shortage, it is only around ten million piculs, which does not necessarily require foreign rice for relief. However, it is definitely not as severe as anticipated, and the panic period should be during the transition between the old and new crops next year. The situation can be maintained in a normal state within the year. The recent soaring rice prices are not due to supply exceeding demand, but rather the result of rice merchants' speculation. Once strict restrictions are imposed, it will not be difficult to suppress them. It is expected that there may be a significant reaction and decline in the prices in October or November this winter, which is something that all hoarders should pay attention to.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Forward Foreign Rice Imports under Bond <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wu continued, the grain panic next spring is inevitable. I previously drafted a plan to allow rice merchants to order forward foreign rice under bond and submitted it to the Grain Management Committee for resolution, together with the Zhejiang Provincial Government, to request approval from the Executive Yuan. The plan stipulates that the selling price should not exceed 12 yuan. If the rice price falls below 9 yuan at that time, the import tax on foreign rice will be fully exempted. If the rice price is at 9 yuan, the import tax on foreign rice will be reduced by half. If the rice price is above 10 yuan, the import tax on foreign rice will be fully levied. This measure is effective in regulating the grain supply and suppressing prices. However, due to its complexity, it has not been understood and agreed upon by the relevant parties, and it may not be easily implemented at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Foreign Rice Should Be Transported by National Vessels <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Shipping Association Submits Petition to Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>Please Instruct Bean and Rice Merchants to Comply</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, due to the severe drought and poor harvests in various regions, bean and rice merchants are busily procuring foreign rice to regulate the people's food supply. As of now, the total amount has reached 300,000 piculs. The Shanghai Shipping Association points out that the areas where foreign rice is procured are Saigon in Annam, Rangoon in Burma, and Bangkok in Siam. The foreign rice procured by rice merchants is delivered locally and must be transported by ships. Therefore, the association has submitted a petition to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that the bean and rice merchants be instructed to use national vessels for all foreign rice procurement to recover the benefits.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Yang Dezhao Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Will Visit Chiang in Lushan after Staying for a Day or Two</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army, who was stationed in Nanjing, returned to Guangdong last month to report on the situation in Nanjing. His mission has been completed. Yesterday afternoon, at 2:30 PM, he arrived in Shanghai aboard the Changxing Company's Asia Queen liner. His wife and others were there to greet him at the port. After disembarking, Mr. Yang returned to his private residence for rest. He is scheduled to visit Chairman Chiang in Lushan within the next few days. A Central News Agency reporter met Mr. Yang on the ship yesterday and asked him the following questions:</p>
<h3 id="e115">Chen Jitang Finds It Difficult to Go North for the Time Being <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yang denied the rumor that he was carrying a personal letter from Chairman Chiang to Chen Jitang this time. He stated that in addition to reporting his mission in Nanjing to Mr. Chen, he also returned to his hometown to inspect schools and mining organizations. This was purely a personal matter. As for the news that Chen Jitang would be coming to Nanjing and Shanghai for inspection, Mr. Chen himself had the intention, but due to the complexity of military and political affairs, he believed it would not be possible for the time being. Xiao Focheng has not returned to Siam since returning to China and has no intention of going there again.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Joint Bandit Suppression to Launch General Offensive Immediately <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>As for the joint suppression of the remnants of bandits in Fujian and Jiangxi by the southeastern routes, the deployment of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army has now been completed. As soon as the autumn weather cools down, a general offensive can be launched immediately. The central government's monthly subsidy for the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army has not yet been increased. Mr. Yang denied reports that he was ordered to go to Fujian to meet with Chen Yi, the Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, to discuss the joint bandit suppression by the southeastern routes, stating that he had not left Guangdong to go to Fujian.</p>

<p>The members of the Central Committee in Guangdong and Hong Kong have not yet expressed their views on the convocation of the Fifth National Congress. However, at this time of national crisis, they share the same determination with the central government to unite and save the country. As for whether the issue of abolishing the two southwestern organs will be submitted to the Fifth National Congress for discussion, no decision has been made yet.</p>

<p>Mr. Yang intends to stay in Shanghai for a day or two to rest after the arduous journey, and then go to Lushan to visit Chairman Chiang. His wife and others also plan to go with him. However, he stated that the reports that he would go to Jiangxi to participate in the Lushan conference were inaccurate.</p>

He will come to China again in mid-September to meet with the central authorities. The rumors were not confirmed.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Origin of the Mission <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>King Leopold III, the new King of Belgium, has demonstrated remarkable political achievements since he ascended the throne this spring. Following the royal tradition, he has specially dispatched a special envoy to visit various countries. The mission is to inform the heads of friendly nations of the death of the late King Albert, the new King's ascension to the throne, and to thank the friendly nations for their enthusiasm in participating in the above two ceremonies, thereby strengthening diplomatic ties.</p>

At the same time, he will visit Premier Wang and others, and plan to go to Jiangxi to visit Chairman Chiang, and take the opportunity to travel to famous scenic spots in the north and south of China, and investigate the construction of China. He will stay in China for about two weeks before returning to Belgium.</p>

<p>Baron Johnson, the special envoy dispatched to China this time, is currently the general manager of the Belgian Silver Company, is rich in assets, and is one of the leaders of the Belgian financial community.

<p>Tan Xihong Dispatched by the Ministry of Industry</p>
<h3 id="e124">To Shanghai to Investigate Silk Factories <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Silk Prices Plummet, Manufacturers Unable to Maintain Operations</p>
<p>Investigate the Current Situation to Seek Fundamental Relief</p>
<p>Due to the impact of Japanese silk dumping during the new cocoon season, silk prices in Shanghai have plummeted, resulting in excessive losses, making it impossible for manufacturers to maintain operations. However, for the sake of the livelihood of workers and social security, they are reluctant to let them suffer the pain of unemployment. It is estimated that only 33 factories in the city are barely operating, and five of them have been forced to shut down one after another, making the future of the silk industry increasingly bleak. In order to seek relief, the authorities of the Executive Yuan have instructed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to formulate relief measures, and the two ministries have separately planned and decided on four model principles. The Ministry of Industry has dispatched Tan Xihong, the director of the Department of Agriculture, to Shanghai to investigate the current situation of production and sales of silk factories, and the truth about the losses, in order to seek fundamental relief. It is learned that Mr. Tan arrived in Shanghai by overnight express yesterday morning and will conduct separate investigations. He will return to Beijing in about a week to report on his mission.</p>
<p>Dispute over Strike of Yellow Automobile Workers</p>
<h3 id="e125">Resolved Yesterday Through Mediation <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after the drivers and workers of the Shanghai Chinese Yellow Automobile Company went on strike in the early morning of the previous day due to dissatisfaction with the company's unwarranted dismissal of workers and poor treatment, the Social Affairs Bureau sent representatives to mediate yesterday, and an eight-article agreement was signed, declaring a resolution. The workers are scheduled to resume work on the 14th.</p>
<p>Resolution Reached: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau considered the strike by the company's workers to be a major event, so even though yesterday was a regular holiday, it still sent Wang Xianqing, the director of the Mediation Section of the Third Division, to the company on Pushi Road to mediate. Wang Xianqing served as chairman, and the representatives of the management, Lin Zhongming, the representatives of the drivers' union, Zhu Weichang, Chen Daofu, and Yu Damin, and the representatives of the workers, Cheng Rongsheng, Zhang Genfu, and Zhu Guoliang, first stated their experiences, and then the chairman summarized the opinions of both parties and made exhortations.</p>
<p>As a result of the signing of the agreement, both parties reached an agreement and signed the agreement until 9:00 PM. The original text is as follows: (1) All drivers are allowed to resume work uniformly at 7:00 AM on the 14th of this month, and wages will not be deducted. (2) The work system will be implemented in accordance with the new regulations promulgated by the company on August 1st of this year.

<p>Requests to Amend Various Articles Have Not Yet Been Replied to</p>
<p>Documents Submitted by Non-Member Banks to be Drafted Today</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after the promulgation of the Savings Bank Law, the banking industry association requested amendments to Articles 5, 7, 8, and 15. A subcommittee has been formed for Article 9 and will meet today to study it. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e131">Request for Amendments <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The banking industry association has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance to delete the restriction in Article 5 that the total amount of current deposits should not exceed 40%, to delete Articles 7.4 and 7.5, to delete the restrictions on the composition of Article 8, and to amend Article 15 and the restrictions on lending to rural areas in Article 8. As of yesterday, no reply has been received from the Yuan and the Ministry. After all non-members agree with the association's documents, they will be corrected today and sent to the non-member banks for sealing, so that they can be submitted to the Yuan and the Ministry for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Studying Implementation <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>After the 53rd executive committee meeting of the banking industry association decided to form a subcommittee to study Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law, it has been decided to convene a subcommittee meeting this afternoon to study how to implement and manage it. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the banking industry yesterday that the banking association has never opposed Article 9 in principle. It initially requested a delay in implementation when requesting amendments to the entire Savings Law. After receiving the order from the Ministry of Finance, it has decided to form a subcommittee to study how to implement it.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Lin Kanghou Talks <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency visited Lin Kanghou, the secretary-general of the banking association, yesterday and asked him about this matter. According to him, the association absolutely agrees with this matter in principle, but because the content of Article 9 of the law is very complicated, the guaranteed assets, types, numbers, and management should be explained in detail and clearly divided, otherwise it will be difficult to implement. Moreover, the Ministry's order that government bonds and treasury bills must be calculated according to market prices is also inappropriate, because government bonds and treasury bills are guaranteed by national tax revenue, and their prices should not be calculated according to market prices. I feel that there are many Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai, and if the government strictly enforces this law on Chinese banks, it cannot be enforced on foreign banks in the same way, which is very unfair. Moreover, financial institutions registered abroad will inevitably increase in the future in order to escape the government's laws and regulations.</p>

Therefore, the railway bureau yesterday sent a letter to Mr. Cheng, etc., informing them that the trip to Dalian would be temporarily suspended, but Mr. Ouyang would still be sent to Japan. He has scheduled to take the President Hoover on the 14th to go to Japan first to arrange everything.

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Chamber of Commerce of Yidu County, Shandong Province, yesterday stating that "our county has fertile soil. In recent years, major tobacco companies have come to guide and spread improved tobacco seeds. The tobacco leaves produced have excellent aroma and color and are well received by smokers. Therefore, last year, all the factories that came to set up factories were satisfied. Our association has also built many houses and warehouses on the roadside of the station for the convenience of merchants and travelers in the tobacco market, specially prepared for tobacco merchants to settle down, purchase tobacco and store goods. No matter the maintenance of public order and the provision of food and accommodation, we will do our best to prepare them, so that they have a feeling of being at home. It has been quite effective for more than a year. Now it is time for the new tobacco to be on the market again. We plan to ask the major tobacco companies to come to our county to set up factories and purchase tobacco in order to prosper the market. If the companies are willing to come, then our association dares to take full responsibility for other housing funds, public order, and other issues to meet the needs, and will never make the visitors feel any inconvenience. This matter concerns the public interest, and we hope you will introduce it on our behalf." It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has forwarded a letter to the Nanshi Cigarette Industry Association yesterday, encouraging tobacco merchants to go to purchase tobacco.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Order to the Shipping Cooperation Design Committee</p>
<p>Hoping to Expedite the Completion of a Concrete Plan</p>
<p>In order to promote shipping cooperation, the Ministry of Communications specially organized the China Shipping Cooperation Design Committee in March of this year, with representatives from various shipping companies in Shanghai participating, and set a deadline of six months to complete the plan, and ordered all shipping companies to maintain the status quo and not compete during the shipping cooperation plan period. It is learned that the Ministry of Communications yesterday specially ordered the committee to expedite the completion of a concrete plan in order to implement it. The original text said, "It has been found that since the establishment of the committee, four months have passed in an instant. There are only two months left for the deadline for preparing a detailed report and six concrete cases of cooperation. The deadline is pressing, and the report and plan are the basis for the future implementation of shipping cooperation. The Ministry has repeatedly received requests from shipping companies in Hankou, Zhenjiang, and other places to organize a shipping cooperation design committee to the Ministry, and all have been approved. The wait for the committee's report and plan to be completed will be used as a basis. Therefore, the expectations of all parties are so high, and the deadline is so pressing. We should expedite the formulation of concrete measures and must complete the matter on schedule to avoid delays. Sincerely, this order."</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the Capital Ferry on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway at Xiaguan Coal Wharf began operation last year, the loading and unloading work has gradually decreased. The dockworkers, fearing unemployment, petitioned various agencies for relief. The Railway Bureau, recognizing the urgency of the workers' request, sent personnel to Nanjing to work with local agencies to develop a relief plan. However, due to the complexity of the issues and the involvement of the dispute over the dismissal of dockworkers at Pukou, the case remained unresolved for over a year. On the third of last month, the Railway Bureau again sent personnel to Nanjing, instructing the loading and unloading contractors to first register workers. At the same time, they assessed work performance and conducted physical examinations to determine who would stay and who would leave. As a result, 211 workers were qualified to stay, while 294 were dismissed. An agreement was reached with the workers, and with the sympathy of various agencies, the Railway Bureau allocated 5,000 silver dollars as relief funds for the dismissed workers. Except for those impersonating others, 135 workers were eligible for relief funds, totaling 4,820 silver dollars. This money was distributed on the 23rd of last month under the supervision of representatives from various agencies, and each dismissed worker received their share. The case was thus concluded. Unexpectedly, on the 26th, a group of dismissed workers, incited by others, again formed a group to petition and submitted a petition to the Railway Bureau, claiming that the relief method was unfair. Upon receiving this news, the Railway Bureau urgently dispatched Director Xiao of the Traffic Department and Director Ma of the Police Department to Nanjing on the 6th of this month to investigate. They immediately summoned representatives of the petitioners for talks at the station. As the representatives had not arrived, the Ministry of Railways convened another meeting on the 7th. The representatives presented the following demands: (1) Those who did not register by July 10th should be allowed to register retroactively, and those dismissed workers who were still strong and capable should be re-examined for re-employment; (2) They opposed the contractors and foremen who were retained; (3) Foremen of each team should be elected by the workers in the future. At that time, the Railway Bureau accepted the first and third demands, and agreed to consider the second. The representatives were also informed that within two days, they should provide a list of workers requesting retroactive registration and re-examination to Director Xiao for review. On the 8th, the Railway Bureau convened the representatives of the petitioners, contractors, and retained foremen at Xiaguan Station to discuss the steps to resolve the case, and also invited Director Xu of the Military Police Headquarters to attend. It was agreed on the spot that the first step would be to issue service certificates to the retained workers starting at 11:00 AM on August 10th; the second step would be to conduct retroactive registration and examination; and the third step would be to elect foremen. All parties agreed. On the 9th, the petitioners came to the station again to report difficulties, abruptly overturning the previous agreement and attaching many additional demands. The Railway Bureau repeatedly persuaded them to comply. Although the representatives seemed to agree on the surface, they gathered again on the morning of the 10th and went to the Ministry of Railways to continue their petition. Seeing that the representatives had repeatedly gone back on their word and could not be reasoned with, the Railway Bureau separately requested the Nanjing City Party Headquarters, the Nanjing City Social Affairs Bureau, the Police Department, the Military Police Headquarters, and the Ministry of Railways to send representatives to the station to supervise the issuance of service certificates to the retained workers, and requested the Military Police Headquarters and the Police Department to send additional troops and police to maintain order. Representatives from various agencies, including Wang Huibai, Zhou Jichang, You Siguang, Lang Zulin, and Wang Rongcheng from the Police Department, Pan Suizhang and Xu Qijie from the Military Police Headquarters, Xiong Yuemu from the Social Affairs Bureau, Sui Guanglu from the City Party Headquarters, and Section Chief Yin and Section Chief Yang from the Ministry of Railways, respectively issued service certificates to the retained workers starting at 11:00 AM. By 5:00 PM, 192 people had received their service certificates. Finally, Director Xiao explained the process of the Railway Bureau's handling of the case and urged the workers to work with peace of mind. Representatives from various agencies unanimously elected Director Pan of the Military Police Headquarters to deliver a speech, which was quite moving. During the distribution of the workers' service certificates, although some women made noise outside the station, the situation remained peaceful thanks to the effective maintenance of order by the military and police.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Agricultural and Commercial Bank to Open the Day After Tomorrow <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a meeting of all bank staff was held.</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo will personally come to Shanghai to officiate the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>The Agricultural and Commercial Bank, jointly established by the Ministry of Industry with official and commercial capital, is fully prepared and has decided to officially open at 9:00 AM the day after tomorrow (the 15th). Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry is expected to come to Shanghai to preside over the ceremony. The General Manager recently went to Beijing to consult with Minister Chen and has now returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties. The candidates for the four section chiefs of the General Administration have also been decided. All important staff of the bank held a meeting yesterday to discuss various issues related to the opening. The banknotes previously stored in Beijing have also been transported to Shanghai in preparation for issuance. The news is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Mei Returns to Shanghai, the General Manager of the Bank, Mr. Mei Zhezhi, went to Beijing on the 8th to meet with Minister Chen, inquire about the bank's operating policies, and report on the progress of preparations. After arriving in Beijing, he returned to Shanghai immediately because the opening date was approaching and there were many internal arrangements and tasks. He arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. According to Mr. Mei, both the internal and external arrangements of the bank have been completed and it is scheduled to open on the 15th without further delay.</p>
<p>Four Section Chiefs The organization of the General Administration of the bank is divided into four sections: Document, Accounting, Business, and Issuance. The candidates for the section chiefs have been decided as follows: Chen Fuyi for Document Section, Tang Peiheng for Accounting Section, Gong Xiangxian for Business Section, and Zhang Yu for Issuance Section. Except for Gong Xiangxian, the chief of the Business Section, the other three chiefs have already reported to work.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting At 9:00 AM yesterday, all important staff of the bank held an opening meeting in the conference room of the General Administration on Henan Road. Chairman Mei Zhezhi presided over the meeting to discuss the division of responsibilities and other issues after the opening. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. According to the secretary, today's meeting was only to discuss the opening issues and the content cannot be disclosed. There are a total of 61 staff members in the bank.</p>
<p>Opening the Day After Tomorrow The bank issued a notice yesterday stating that the bank has raised a capital of 3 million yuan, which has been approved and registered by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, and has been approved to issue convertible banknotes. It is hereby announced that the bank will open for business on August 15th.</p>
<p>Simple Ceremony According to the secretary of the General Administration, there will be no special ceremony for the opening of the bank on the 15th, just like any ordinary bank. Whether Minister Chen will come to Shanghai depends on whether the Ministry has any important official business at that time. If there is no important official business, he will definitely come to Shanghai to preside over everything. As for Mr. Mei's position as Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industry, Mr. Mei himself has submitted his resignation and firmly requested to leave in order to focus on the affairs of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank. However, the Minister is still trying to retain him and has temporarily appointed someone else to act in Mei's position.</p>
<p>Banknotes Transported to Shanghai When the Agricultural Bank was established in 1923, it was approved by the government to issue banknotes. Therefore, after its restoration this time, it will issue the banknotes that were previously printed but not issued. The denominations are one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan. The General Administration has sent personnel to Beijing to collect and transport the banknotes to Shanghai for issuance when the bank opens the day after tomorrow.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Association sent a letter to Mayor Wu yesterday stating that according to a letter from its member, Zengsheng Ramie Yarn and Tape Factory, "Our factory, in view of the densely populated buildings in Shanghai and the frequent occurrence of fires, has invented a type of Taiping Escape Ladder, which is 16 feet long and can be contracted and expanded at any time. The upper end uses iron hooks. In the event of a fire, it can be hung on the window if necessary, so that people can safely reach the ground. It is indeed a product for home security." Therefore, two Taiping Escape Ladders are sent for your association to examine and forward them to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Fire Fighting Association for inspection and approval, so as to promote and facilitate sales. The association stated that the factory was founded by its executive committee member, Mr. Lu Xingzhuang, and its products, such as ramie yarn, tape, and harness ropes, can be sold to various ports in Southeast Asia, recovering commercial rights. Now, a type of Taiping Escape Ladder has been invented, which is simple to use, sturdy, and durable. It can assist in fire fighting and protect public safety. It is proposed to ask the Mayor to review and guide it so as to promote it. A Taiping Escape Ladder is attached for inspection and sent to the fire fighters for trial use and familiarity, in case of emergency.</p>
<p>Tongshun and Ji'an Vessels</p>
<h3 id="e145">Collide on the Huangpu River at Lujiazui <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Ji'an's Upper Deck Damaged</p>
<p>The Tongshun Vessel Sails as Usual</p>
<p>The Datong Company's Tongshun vessel, which departed from Shanghai yesterday en route to the Yangtze River, collided with the Swire Company's Ji'an vessel, which was entering Shanghai, near the mouth of the Suzhou Creek at Lujiazui. The Ji'an's upper deck was damaged, while the Tongshun sailed as usual. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Collision The Tongshun vessel loaded cargo at the Ronglin Wharf in Nanshi at around 4:00 PM yesterday and set sail for Wuhu. At 5:30 PM, it collided with the Swire Company's Ji'an vessel, which was coming to Shanghai from the Yangtze River, near the Baidu Bridge outside the mouth of the Suzhou Creek at Lujiazui. At that time, it was low tide and the current was very rapid. The two vessels met and were already very close, so they could not avoid each other. The port and starboard sides of the two vessels collided. The Tongshun was a cargo ship without passengers, while the Ji'an had many passengers. The passengers were greatly alarmed during the collision, but fortunately there were no accidents.</p>
<p>Damage Although the two vessels collided, they were able to avoid each other effectively. Therefore, only the three upper decks on the starboard side of the Ji'an vessel were destroyed. The Tongshun vessel was not damaged. After the collision, both vessels stopped and hoisted flags to report to the Customs.</p>
<p>Inspection The River and Sea Customs Shipping Office saw the two vessels hoisting flags to report and immediately sent personnel to the scene to investigate. The water police also sent detectives to the scene to investigate. After the Customs officer inspected the damaged area of the Ji'an and inquired about the situation, the captains of both vessels signed their names for future negotiation. The Ji'an then sailed to the Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong to dock, pending a report to the company today. The Tongshun vessel was not damaged and sailed as usual.</p>
<p>Negotiation Yesterday was Sunday and the Swire Company was closed as usual. There was no statement on the Ji'an's collision damage. The negotiation will take place after the captain's report today. On the Datong Company's side, a reporter went to the company to inquire at around 8:00 PM last night. According to an employee, Mr. Zhang, he only knew that the Tongshun vessel had departed and had not heard anything about the accident. The captain had not reported it either.</p>

After the committee members expressed their opinions, three resolutions were passed: (1) Send a letter to the French Municipal Council requesting the cancellation of the company's change of regulations and continue to operate according to the old regulations, so as to reduce the burden on the citizens; (2) Send a letter to the general association requesting the Municipal Council to negotiate on the basis of reason and strive to achieve the purpose of canceling the disguised price increase; (3) In addition to sending a letter to the Ratepayers' Association for negotiation, question the two Chinese directors, Lu Bohong and Zhu Yan, who participated in the Municipal Council, whether they expressed any objections when the company requested to increase the deposit fees, and ask whether Mr. Lu and Mr. Zhu have any mature rescue measures to comply with public opinion. Next, the meeting discussed the joint letter from the stores in Tangjiawan Market, including Xie Lixiang, requesting the ban on public toilets in the market in order to emphasize hygiene. It was resolved to forward it to the Municipal Government for prohibition. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Notice from the Fourth Branch <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation issued a special notice to its members yesterday stating: "Regarding the matter of notice, the French water and electricity company, in this time of economic recession and extreme economic decline, has suddenly increased the deposit fees, disregarding the suffering of the citizens, and arbitrarily increased prices in disguise. The association has repeatedly received requests from members to oppose it on the basis of reason and find ways to prevent the company from changing its regulations, so as to avoid disguised price increases and reduce the burden on the citizens. After an emergency meeting, it was resolved that in addition to sending a letter to the general association for negotiation and sending letters to the Chinese directors of the French Concession Ratepayers' Association to make suggestions to the French Municipal Council to stop the company from changing its regulations and strive to achieve the cancellation of the increase in deposit fees, all members should pay attention to all the company's actions. If any suspicious documents are found, please report to the association immediately so that negotiations can be based on them. The resolution has been recorded, and a special notice is hereby issued to all members to pay attention to it."</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government, in view of the fact that the production of flowers and rice are the main industries in the county, and that the people's livelihood is frequently endangered in times of famine, and that the promotion of subsidiary occupations, such as fish farming, bamboo planting, chicken raising, and planting flowers, fruits, and vegetables, costs little and yields great benefits, which is related to the development of the rural economy, specially instructed the newly appointed township and town chiefs in each district to carefully assess the local conditions and vigorously promote subsidiary occupations for farmers in the future, and to often lead farmers to visit the Qiangshu Horticultural School, which has achieved success in the county, in order to learn from it and benefit the people's livelihood.</p>

<p>More than 100 Tobacco and Exchange Businesses</p>
<h3 id="e151">Appeal to Maintain the Original Quota of Licenses <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco and Exchange Business Association previously received a report from its member, Ding Ruitai, of Lao Baidu Street in Nanshi, stating that the tax for a Class D license for donated tobacco was 2 yuan per quarter, but now the investigators from the Shinan Tax Collection Office of the Finance Bureau said that it must be 20 yuan. It was also reported by Ding He Xiang, a member of Caojiadu Wujiaochang, that the tax for a Class D license for donated tobacco was 4 yuan per quarter, but now the investigators from the Shixi Tax Collection Office ordered them to obtain a 40-yuan license. In addition, they would have to donate 4 yuan, 8 yuan, or 12 yuan for each sale, which was undecided and requested a meeting to discuss. The members of the association were panicked upon hearing this news. Those who had registered did not dare to apply for the new licenses. Those who donated 2 yuan are now required to increase it to 4 yuan. More than 100 businesses, such as Damin Store on Anlan Road, jointly signed a letter to the association yesterday, sending all the license receipts to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to forward it to the Finance Bureau and maintain the original practice to show consideration and reduce the burden. The original letter is excerpted as follows: "Our stores, with a limited and extremely small scope, have been struggling to maintain their business and are barely able to pay taxes. In view of the commercial difficulties, the authorities have always listed our stores in the Class D tax bracket. Unexpectedly, in order to increase tax revenue, the Finance Bureau has disregarded the suffering of our industry and changed the Class D licenses of our stores to Class C, and Class C to Class B, implementing a double tax collection. Our stores are now experiencing sluggish business and have reached the extreme of suffering. Moreover, the competition among our neighbors is fierce, and it is not easy to make a small profit. How can we bear this heavy burden? The above situation is very clear. We hereby send this letter to your association, attaching the license receipts, and request you to forward it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and present the detailed situation to the Finance Bureau, explaining the plight of small businesses and the current economic downturn, and that our donations and taxes should be allowed to be paid according to the original quota. Not only will our stores benefit greatly, but all the businesses will be grateful. Please make efforts for our stores, and the Finance Bureau will definitely consider the commercial difficulties. " It is said that the association attaches great importance to this issue and has decided to call a joint meeting of the relevant tobacco and alcohol associations to make a final request to the authorities.</p>

<p>Shangde Lane</p>
<h3 id="e154">Seeking Court Relief for Rent Reduction Requests <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Shangde Lane Branch of the Third District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation has submitted a letter to the Third District Branch to forward it to the court for relief regarding the rent reduction movement. The original letter is recorded as follows: "To whom it may concern: We have recently received a letter from the Shangde Lane Branch stating that when the citizens rented houses in Shangde Lane, each family paid a small rent of 300 to 400 yuan. Recently, due to the economic downturn and the sluggish market, the rent reduction movement is an urgent need of the times, and it is also justified to demand the return of the illegally paid small rent. The landlord should accept this reasonable request as much as possible to maintain the relationship between the landlord and tenant. Not only will the citizens benefit and Shanghai prosper, but it will also be in this move. However, the landlord did not intend to do this, but used high-pressure tactics, using the excuse of rent arrears, and entrusted lawyer Qian Baohe to send a letter to Zhang Hongshan, Wang Damao, and others to recover the rent. The rent in Shangde Lane is more expensive than in other areas, and it is necessary to reduce the rent. And the small rent of 300 to 400 yuan paid when entering the house can be used to offset the rent, so the rent arrears are no longer a fact. We should ask your association to send a letter to the court to declare it, so as to avoid the landlord's obscuring the facts in court, causing losses that can be feared. The rent reduction movement is caused by the economic downturn, and the illegal small rent is strictly prohibited by law. The association's request for rent reduction and recovery of small rent are justified and are completely different from ordinary rent arrears. We hereby send this letter to your court, respectfully requesting your court to approve the record and provide relief according to law, so as to benefit the people. The president of the Second Special District Local Court, Sheng Zhiren, Standing Committee Member."</p>

He was taken to the First Special District Court, where he claimed that the guns, bullets, and jewelry were stored there by Han Er, who was at large, and that he did not participate in the robbery. However, Yang Hai, a shop employee, testified that he saw him at the scene holding a handgun. He was detained for further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan presided over the continued hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Mr. Ru Baoyi, the lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that the defendant had fully confessed to the crime at the police station and presented the confession for review, requesting a severe sentence. The defendant confessed that he was invited by Han Er, who was at large, to participate in the robbery. He said that Zhang San, Chen Jinbiao, and two others were also involved, and that he received 66 yuan after the robbery. Judge Wu sentenced Shen Wancai to seven years in prison. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be deducted from the sentence, with two days of detention counting as one day of imprisonment.

<h3 id="e163">Recent News from the South District Rent Reduction Committee <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The South Shanghai District Rent Reduction Committee of Shanghai received a joint petition from the tenants of Qingyu Lane on Xietu Road, requesting the committee to seek a rent reduction from the landlord. The committee sent a letter to the landlord, Liu Qingyu, who repeatedly stated that the rent was already low and presented evidence from the March 1st edition of the Xinwen Bao newspaper that a rent reduction had already been granted. The committee, adhering to its principles, will commend landlords who have already reduced rent to acknowledge their benevolence. However, the committee believes the tenant's desire to reduce rent again is unreasonable and has strictly forbidden it. Recently, Mr. Wang Yueling, the landlord of Tongda Company on Minguo Road, personally visited the committee to discuss a rent reduction, agreeing to the following contract: Rent Reduction Mediation Agreement (Mediation Address): South Shanghai District Rent Reduction Committee. (Rent Calculation): Previous rent was 260 yuan, now 221 yuan. (Mediation Result): 85% discount, totaling 221 yuan. (Rent Reduction Period): From May 1934 to December 1937. After one year, both parties should act in good faith and make adjustments based on market conditions, but neither party should take extreme measures. (Mediator): South Shanghai District Rent Reduction Committee. (Tenant): Landlord Wang Yueling, Tenants Chen Shengtao and others. (Witness): Shen Xinfu, Standing Committee Member of the South District Rent Reduction Committee. Each party will retain a copy of the above mediation agreement for their records. Furthermore, after receiving the committee's letter advising a rent reduction, the landlord of Chengzhi Lane on Jingxiu Road not only failed to respond but also entrusted the management of the properties to the French accountant Daley &amp; Co. After receiving a report from the tenants of Chengzhi Lane, the committee issued a notice: "To whom it may concern, We have recently received a report from Gu Xiayun, the representative of Chengzhi Lane, stating that the lane has submitted a request for rent reduction to your committee, resulting in a letter to the landlord Chengzhi Company. The landlord has repeatedly sent representatives to negotiate, only promising Xiayun personal rent reduction benefits, but not for the entire lane. We believe that rent reduction is a matter of maintaining the livelihood of the entire community. Xiayun is a resident of the same lane and also a petitioner for rent reduction. Why should she seek illegal personal benefits in the name of the group? Therefore, we politely refused and instructed the representative to negotiate directly with the South District Rent Reduction Committee. The representative, realizing her scheme had failed, suddenly posted a blatant announcement by Daley &amp; Co., a French accountant, in the lane on the 4th of this month, stating that Daley &amp; Co. would manage the properties from August 1st onwards. Moreover, the Chengzhi Company did not formally notify us beforehand. This action clearly abandons China's inherent civilization and disregards the obligation to help each other in times of crisis, using foreign influence to undermine the prosperity of the South District. Apart from declaring our disapproval, we will not accept any intervention by foreigners in the interaction between Chinese people until the issue of mutual assistance between Chinese and humans is resolved. We implore for assistance to uphold the livelihood of the people." The committee notes that it sent a letter to the landlord Chengzhi Company on May 16th regarding the request for rent reduction from the lane, along with No. 2 Tianzhutang Street and No. 2 South Gaoshou Lane on Zhabei Haining Road. The landlord disregarded the committee's earnest appeals and incited Gu Xiayun and others to sow discord by employing unclear foreign tactics, undermining the peaceful residence of the citizens of the South District, which is truly heartbreaking. The committee believes that the rent reduction movement is a necessary awakening for both landlords and tenants. For example, after receiving the committee's letter urging a rent reduction, the landlord Ding of the Kuangda Tea Company on Minguo Road immediately agreed to a rent reduction and abolished the original management to compensate for the loss during the rent reduction period. The committee deeply admires landlords who understand the greater good. However, the committee hopes that landlords will not stop employing doormen or property managers due to rent reduction, so as not to cause more unemployment in society. Now, during the citywide rent reduction mobilization, the landlord Wu of Chengzhi Lane not only does not seek to benefit his compatriots but actually invests in entrusting a foreign merchant, revealing his intentions through his actions. For the sake of peace, the committee sincerely hopes that the landlord, with the compassion of a Chinese, will join hands to revive the ailing Shanghai market, fulfilling the obligation of helping each other in times of crisis to resolve the rent reduction issue. The committee also hopes that Daley &amp; Co., with the spirit of friendship between our nations, will not join in during this period of Sino-foreign cooperation for revival and put themselves in a difficult position before the rent reduction issue is resolved. On the tenant side, it is necessary to act in accordance with the committee's regulations and not default on rent under the pretext of rent reduction, otherwise, landlords will use this as an excuse, leading to unrest instead of peace. We hope that both parties will make concessions to avoid causing disputes. In addition to informing all parties, we hereby issue this public notice.</p>
<h3 id="e164">West City Business Community Requests Rent Reduction Meeting <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Because of the high rent and the owners not following the Municipal Government's regulations regarding original rent amounts, the West City Chen Yingshi Jianjiao Tsui Tanan Ba Business Shops are requesting reductions but the owners have ignored the request, causing disputes. Yesterday at 8pm a continuation meeting was held at the Business Alliance, with everyone in attendance. Publicly elected as chairman was Cao Mo, a representative from the Huizhong Printing House, and Ding Songan as secretary, conducting the ceremony per usual. The chairman gave a report that the landlord ignored the rent reduction request, and for the tenants, the only way to deal with the situation is to stop paying rent. But continuing to do this will inevitably lead to other disputes and the people should seek concrete countermeasures. After Wang Shenqing and others expressed their opinions, the measures for local rent reduction included (1) submitting the owner's disregard for the rent reduction request and overcharging rent to the Municipal Government's Rent Dispute Committee, requesting to correct the owner's illegal behavior, (2) before resolving the rent reduction, the rent should be deposited into the West City branch of the Shanghai Municipal Bank to avoid excuses, (3) each tenant has established an alliance agreement and will remain consistent and not be tempted by any benefits from the owner, (4) submitting the owner's illegal behavior to various agencies and groups, requesting assistance, and (5) awakening the South Shanghai business community to urgently start an automatic rent reduction movement, free from any control. All the above measures were approved and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>The houses in Leyi Lane on Nanyangqiao Annakin Road in the French Concession, totaling over thirty buildings, are the property of the Chinese businessman Jiang Hanzhai and are managed by the Teepack Property Department. The houses are relatively new and quite sturdy. Recently, the owner suddenly instructed the management office to notify the tenants that the houses are dilapidated and should be rebuilt immediately, ordering all tenants to move out by the end of August of this year, with water cut off and barricades erected on July 25th. All the tenants were immediately alarmed. Everyone believed that the owner had previously announced demolition, and representatives were sent to request a postponement, which was granted, with a letter from the management office as proof. This reversal of words is suspicious, and the houses are in good condition. Forced demolition and eviction of tenants under the current economic downturn are inappropriate. A unanimous objection was raised, and a report was filed with the Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District City Federation. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, a general meeting was held at the federation's headquarters to discuss countermeasures. Over thirty tenants attended, along with Director Dong Wenli, Ye Ruizhai, Committee Member Tong Lizhang, and Xu Yanwu from the Fourth District City Federation Branch, who attended to provide guidance. Li Yuting was publicly elected as chairman. After the report, the following countermeasures were resolved: (1) All tenants firmly expressed their opposition, vowing not to move out under any pressure. (2) The good condition of the lane and the owner's oppressive actions will be reported to the Party and government authorities and various organizations, advocating for fairness and preventing the demolition. (3) A letter will be sent to the Fourth Branch of the Civic Association in this district to fully negotiate and ensure the revocation of the demolition order. (4) Unite and establish an alliance agreement, refraining from any disruptive actions to facilitate negotiations. (5) Investigate details of rent arrears and deposit all rents into a bank for safekeeping. (6) Li Yuting, Wang Dekui, and Tang Baoshan were designated as tenant representatives. (7) If necessary, retain a lawyer as a legal advisor to safeguard our rights and interests. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Wang Zhixiang, Director of the Jiangsu Province Shangbao and Special District Sulfur Bureau, in order to enforce regulations, stated that Jiang Wanghuai, Director of the directly administered North City Sulfur Branch, has been in office for nearly three months since taking over. According to the contract, the remaining profits should have been submitted, but no payments have been made, which is a violation of the contract. Furthermore, the unauthorized establishment of the Hongzhen Distribution Point was inappropriate. Based on various facts, these actions are outside the scope of the sales regulations. Yesterday, Director Wang dismissed the director for incompetence and ordered him to be dismissed along with Zhang Zhiman and others from the Hongzhen Distribution Point. All business tax revenue of the branch will be concurrently managed by Sun Zixiang, Director of the South Branch. A notice has been sent to all agencies for their information.</p>

<p>Tenants Detail the Dire State of All Industries</p>
<p>Hoping to Settle Down and Request the Original Lawsuit Be Rejected</p>
<p>At this time of intense rent reduction movements, Gao Yi, a British real estate agency, still wants to increase the rent for tenants in Shoupin Lane on Huade Road. Because all tenants unanimously refused, the real estate agency hired a lawyer to sue in the First Special District District Court, requesting approval for a rent increase. According to the lawsuit, the houses in Shoupin Lane were built by the former Italian Products Bank in 1926, with a total of 186 residential buildings, costing 295,912 yuan. The land price is about 24,000 yuan per mu, with a total land area of over 18 mu, so the total cost, including the construction cost, reached about 735,000 yuan. The original rent was only 3,500 yuan per month, but monthly expenses such as mortgage interest required more than 5,000 yuan, so</p>

<p>Therefore the tenants have not agreed. Therefore, we ask the court to order the defendants to increase the rent by 70% to provide relief. The tenants of the lane, such as Zhang Jingqing, also hired lawyer Yuan Yangan to submit a defense, saying that the houses in Shoupin Lane had already been increased in rent by the former owner, Yipin Bank, in March 1930. After efforts from the tenants, an agreement was reached, stating that neither party could propose increases or reductions from the first increase to the end of 1933. After the end of 1933, if an increase or decrease was desired, the agreement of both parties was required. Unexpectedly, in the spring of 1933, the Gao Yi real estate agency took over the management of the lane and suddenly wanted to overturn the previous agreement and increase the rent. After the tenants reasonably rebuked the request, an understanding was reached, stating that future increases and decreases in rent should be based on the prosperity or decline of the social economy and require the agreement of</p>

<p>It was determined that his inconsistency was such that on November 20th and December 25th of the 22nd year, he sent letters successively to notify of rent increases, with the amount of the increase ranging from 80% to more than double, a preposterous and shocking claim. At that time, the tenants, citing the sluggish market, insisted on not agreeing. The plaintiff then threatened to demolish the houses and cut off the water supply, and even fabricated lies to report to the police station, publishing notices to order evictions within a limited time. He also sent foremen to the neighborhood to forcibly erect fences, determined to make hundreds of tenants homeless to his delight. Fortunately, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Concession, the Rent Reduction Federation, and other organizations upheld justice, preventing his cunning schemes from succeeding. Who knew that he would become enraged because of this, declaring that he would certainly</p>

<p>To vent his anger. In February of this year, he filed a lawsuit with your court requesting a judgment ordering all tenants to move out. After the defendants submitted various evidence and pleaded according to the law, the court ruled that the plaintiff's lawsuit was rejected and ordered him to bear the litigation costs. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff, with the intention of causing trouble, has now suddenly filed a lawsuit to increase the rent, which is even more unreasonable and outrageous. According to the Civil Code, if the leased property is real estate, the parties may petition the court to increase or decrease the rent based on the rise or fall of its price. In the case at hand, since the January 28th Incident, the area around Avenue Edward VII has been a key route for Japanese military transportation. During the war, the neighborhoods were empty, and after the war, the scars were everywhere. Coupled with this era of economic recession, all industries are declining, and property values are decreasing, which is universally known and requires no proof. The plaintiff's claim of</p>
<h3 id="e180">Rising Land Prices <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>To request a rent increase is purely a fabrication out of thin air and has no basis whatsoever. However, the value of the building decreases due to its age and dilapidation, more than several times compared to when it was newly built. According to the law, the defendants could have petitioned for a reasonable reduction in rent. However, the defendants only seek peaceful residence and do not want to be burdened with litigation, so they did not file a lawsuit. Yet the plaintiff, in the midst of this citywide rent reduction, actually wants to sue for a 70% rent increase, only seeking petty self-interest and disregarding the public good. Judging from both law and human sentiment, this is inappropriate. Moreover, the previously agreed upon rent increase agreement is still valid. The plaintiff has no right to unilaterally request a rent increase. We request that the original lawsuit be rejected and that the litigation costs be borne by the plaintiff, etc. Yesterday, Judge Peng of the First Special Court held a hearing. After clarifying the facts, the lawyers of both parties debated to the end. The court then announced that the judgment would be delivered on the 16th of this month.</p>

<p>Since the government has advocated it from above</p>
<p>The people should respond from below</p>
<p>丨Will imitate the Yuan Dynasty sacrifice to Confucius ceremony丨</p>
<p>Regarding the methods for commemorating Confucius' birthday, the Central Executive Committee Standing Committee resolved to designate it as a national memorial day. The Ministry of Education had already issued a notice to the education departments of all provinces and cities to comply, as reported in yesterday's newspapers. It is now learned that the Datong Music Society in this city believes that Zhonghe Shaole was composed by Emperor Shun and personally revised by Confucius, and later generations used it to worship Confucius. After the establishment of the Republic of China, due to political system reasons, there was no time to produce it. Now that the government has clearly designated August 27th as a national memorial day, advocating it from above, all of our people should respond from below. Therefore, it has been decided that on this year's memorial day, all members will be convened, and in conjunction with various music groups in Shanghai, the Yuan Dynasty sacrifice to Confucius ceremony will be imitated. Labor will be divided and cooperation will be carried out. At the same time, the society's more than 160 kinds of musical instruments at the World College on Ferguson Road will be displayed, and harmonies will be inserted, all arranged into a large-scale elegant music movement, opening a new era of elegant music revival.</p>
<p>Hao Qingyun's ship from Chaohu</p>
<h3 id="e182">Robbed and Murdered in Taihu Lake <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Two crew members killed, others injured</p>
<p>Hao's wife and sister-in-law kidnapped, property robbed</p>
<p>Hao Qingyun's ship from Chaohu, with a capacity of 2,000 dan, has always specialized in transporting porcelain from Jiangxi to Shanghai. Recently, due to the sluggish porcelain business, he was hired by Yiji, a merchant from Anhui stationed in Shanghai, to transport 1,700 bags of flour to Anhui for delivery. On the 1st of this month, he set sail from Shanghai. Hao, considering the route, thought that the inland waterway was shorter than the Yangtze River waterway, saving four or five days, and also safer. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 5th of this month, he took the inland waterway and sailed to Taihu Lake, where the junction of Changzhou, Jiangsu, and Anhui is located. Suddenly, two pirate ships came head-on. The pirates fired two shots into the sky, ordering them to stop. Hao, seeing that there were thirty or forty pirates in the two ships, had no choice but to tell the crew to lower the sails and stop. The pirates, holding guns, swarmed onto the ship and interrogated the crew about who the owner was. The crew led them to the aft cabin to point him out. The pirates saw two women in the aft cabin, Hao's wife and sister-in-law. The pirates, seeing their beauty, immediately flirted with them. Two pirates, who were very burly, were the leaders. They ordered the pirates to drag Hao out of the aft cabin and forced him to hand over silver dollars. When he refused, they tied him up with ropes. At the same time, they forced the crew to sail westward for about ten li, to the foot of Taihu Mountain, and stopped. The two pirate leaders ordered the pirates to search and rob. They found more than two hundred silver dollars, and three leather suitcases containing Hao's wife and sister-in-law's clothes and other items. They also opened the hold and moved the flour, ordering the crew to move it to the pirate ships. Two crew members were slow in moving, and they were shot to death. One pirate ship was fully loaded and sailed to Taihu Lake in Anhui Province first. Before leaving, they kidnapped Hao's wife and sister. Hao's wife and sister begged on the ground. The two pirate leaders ordered the pirates to forcibly drag them to a pirate ship and told the crew, "Our boss loves these two women very much. It won't be difficult for them to go with us." Hao's wife and sister cried and called for help. The pirates took out guns to threaten them and stop them from making noise. That pirate ship also sailed to Anhui Province. After the pirates left, the crew untied Hao and sailed the ship back to Wuxi. Most of the crew were injured. They docked in Wuxi, and the injured were sent to the hospital for treatment. The two crew members who were shot and killed were coffined with silver dollars borrowed by Hao from friends. Yesterday, Hao's brother came to Shanghai to report to Yiji, begging for the rescue of Hao's wife and sister. It is said that the robbed goods</p>

<p>丨Ripple in the "listening to tea" custom in Nanyanglou Tea Garden丨</p>
<p>In the Nanyanglou Tea Garden at the intersection of Guangxi Road and Beihai Road, at about 8:30 last night, four or five gangsters came, sat upstairs, drinking tea and arbitrating. First, a person wearing a black silk shirt and pants argued with a person wearing a white silk shirt and pants. They argued for a long time without result, and then they scattered like birds and beasts, going downstairs one after another. As soon as they reached the door, the person wearing the black silk shirt and pants said something disrespectful. The person wearing the white silk shirt heard it, became angry and indignant, and immediately chased after him, grabbed him, and intended to beat him. Unexpectedly, a gust of wind blew the hat off the person wearing the white silk shirt. He bent down to pick it up. At that moment, the person wearing the black silk shirt took the opportunity to pull out a pistol and fired at the other party, but missed. The nearby constables had already gathered upon hearing the sound. The person in the black shirt knew that things were not good and immediately ran away in a southeasterly direction. The constables also quickly chased after him. When they reached the intersection of East Xinqiao and Avenue Edward VII, the black-clad gangster saw that the pursuers were pressing closer and fired at the police again. The Chinese police also returned fire. The black-clad gangster fought and ran, fleeing into Avenue Edward VII towards the Great World. The French Concession police saw the situation and also opened fire to assist. The two sides exchanged dozens of shots, the sound of gunfire was like a string of pearls, bullets flew everywhere, but they were never able to intercept him, and he escaped. However, stray bullets injured six passersby. Among them, one, Teng Baiqing, 15 years old, was shot through the head and died on the spot. There were five others, Xu Shengquan, 15 years old, was shot twice in the abdomen. Zhang Shenshi, 30 years old, was shot in the waist. Their conditions were very critical. Qian Renchu, 35 years old, was shot in the left arm, which was a minor injury. Jia Shoulu, 25 years old, was grazed by a bullet on the forehead. Yang Ruisheng, 47 years old, was shot in the right hand, all of which were minor injuries and not serious. Afterwards, the Chinese police car number 3259 from the Laozha Police Station sent them to Renji Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the French Police Station dispatched detectives to pursue the fleeing criminals. The body of the innocent victim Teng Baiqing was sent to the coroner's office to await examination this morning.</p>
<p>Amid the huge consumption of rouge and perfume</p>
<h3 id="e184">Standing Committee of the Women's National Goods Association Expresses <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Distress over the dumping of imported cosmetics</p>
<p>Sighing at the application of henna to the toes of female students</p>
<p>丨Oppose bare legs, bare feet, and mixed bathing丨</p>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau, the import of rouge and perfume in the first six months of this year was 850,000, and the import of lace was nearly 600,000. The import of cosmetics such as real and imitation jewelry was also staggering. Some say that the barrier of the Women's National Goods Year has been destroyed. A reporter from the Datong News Agency specially went to No. 77 Hehefang, Avenue Joffre, yesterday morning to interview Ms. Lin Kecong, a standing committee member of the Women's National Goods Year Movement Committee, to ask her about her feelings regarding the consumption of cosmetics. The conversation is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Limited Ability, Difficult to Correct <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>According to Ms. Lin, the huge dumping of women's cosmetics has already been seen in the newspapers, and she is deeply saddened by this. The current psychology of women worshipping foreign goods has a long history. The Women's National Goods Year has also fulfilled its due responsibilities in both propaganda and exhibition. However, the accumulated habits are deeply ingrained and cannot be corrected in a short time. Limited ability, it should be understood by the outside world.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Analysis of Consumption Reasons, Two Items <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Lin continued, the import of the above-mentioned cosmetics is not entirely consumed by women in our country, because Shanghai is a mixed place, and there are women from various countries. Therefore, foreign women also consume a lot of cosmetics. At the same time, this year when the new tariff was promulgated, imported cosmetics were also included in the tax reduction list, so their import increased sharply compared to last year, which is also a major reason.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Powdered Legs Are Indeed a Fact <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Lin spoke to this point, and the Datong News Agency reporter asked whether it was true that bare-legged women use rouge and perfume to powder their legs. Ms. Lin said that according to her recent investigation, this custom first became popular in brothels, and then women from good families also competed to imitate it.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Female Students Apply Henna to Their Toes <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Lin continued, what is most regrettable is that some female students in schools are also fashionable. The extent to which they care for their legs is not only satisfied with powdering and spraying perfume. They carefully apply henna to their toes. An ancient saying goes, "Six-inch round skin is smooth and delicate," which can be a portrayal of today's women. However, it is contrary to the purpose of studying.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Hope to Ban Bare Legs, Expressing Sympathy <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The Datong News Agency reporter also asked Ms. Lin whether she had any opinions on the Ping City Government's ban on bare legs. She replied that in her opinion, neat clothing is related to etiquette, so she believes that bare legs and bare feet are boring. As for women's health, it is closely related to exercise. The benefits of bare legs must be minimal, while the time and money they spend on their legs is considerable.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Separate Bathing for Men and Women is Reasonable <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Lin then expressed her views on mixed bathing, saying that it is extremely harmful to hygiene. Men are more likely to have infectious diseases than women, so it is dangerous to bathe together in one pool. Therefore, separate pools for men and women are more reliable. Ms. Lin continued to say that the Guangdong Province's ban on men and women walking and eating together is intended to insult women, and the women's community should unanimously rise up to oppose it. As for the Women's National Goods Year Movement, a meeting will be convened soon to discuss the work plan for the second half of the year, and silver jewelry, worth more than 3,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Gao Wangshi, a 46-year-old Anhui woman living on the upper floor of No. 34 Bailu Road near the City God Temple, adopted a girl named Xiaomaotou (now only five years old) as her adopted daughter a few years ago. Recently, she has often abused Xiaomaotou with various vicious means. Although she has been warned by her neighbors, Gao Wangshi is unreasonable and still beats Xiaomaotou and burns her body with fire, causing Xiaomaotou to cry out in pain, and her cries reach the neighbors, who are all indignant. At 2:00 AM yesterday, Gao Wangshi beat Xiaomaotou again and poured boiling water on her, intending to kill Xiaomaotou, causing the girl to be covered in burns.</p>

<p>Two attempts to skim were discovered</p>
<p>A new employee caused suspicion</p>
<p>Deshun Fresh Meat Shop at No. 247 Xuejiabang, Nanshi, is owned by Xu Ahe from Minhang. In addition to hiring Jiang Xiangsheng from Nanxiang as the manager, the shop also employs Zhang Fusheng as the accountant and Cao Changlin (24 years old, from Pudong) as a shop assistant, to assist in the shop's affairs. The manager, Jiang Xiangsheng, is 46 years old, and his wife, Han, is 38 years old. They have five children, all of whom are young. Jiang previously served as the manager of a fresh meat shop on Difangting Road outside Xiaoximen. In the spring of this year, Xu heard that Jiang was honest and diligent, so he recruited him from that shop to be the manager of Deshun Shop. Later, in order to facilitate his work, Jiang moved his family to the upper floor of the shop. At about 8:00 AM on the first of last month, when the shop was busy with the morning market, Cao secretly put the two silver dollars he had collected from customers into</p>
<h3 id="e193">His Own Pocket <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Intending to skim, when Zhang Fusheng, the accountant, saw him. Zhang immediately told Jiang the truth. Jiang immediately stepped forward and ordered Cao to take out the money, but because Cao denied it, he was angry and reached into Cao's pocket, took out the original money, and threw it on the counter, and told Xu the truth. That night, Jiang knew that he was in the wrong, so he poured a cup of tea in front of Xu and others to express his apology, and swore not to skim again, and asked Xu and others not to publicize the matter, so as not to affect his reputation. At that time, Xu and others agreed to drop the matter because he knew he had changed his ways. However, because of this, Changlin was dissatisfied with Jiang. Around 10:00 AM on the eighth, Cao was ordered by the shop owner to go to a cold storage factory in Xiaodongmen to</p>

<p>At that time, Cao relapsed and took the opportunity to skim two large pieces of fresh meat (totaling more than 20 catties) and sold them to others. Unexpectedly, the matter was soon heard by Manager Jiang, who again told the shop owner the truth. Xu was very angry and scolded Cao and forced him to compensate for the stolen pork in full, otherwise, he would be fired. At that time, Cao also ignored it, but he harbored even more resentment towards Jiang Xiangsheng. Recently, because the shop's business was booming, all the shop assistants were insufficient, so Jiang hired a new assistant to handle miscellaneous affairs. Unexpectedly, Cao mistakenly thought that the employee was the one who would replace his position after he was fired, and recalled that Jiang had repeatedly revealed his secrets. Overwhelmed with resentment, he suddenly had the</p>

<p>At about 8:00 PM the night before, Cao hid a kitchen knife on his bed, intending to take the opportunity to kill Jiang. Around 11:00 PM, Jiang could not sleep in the house due to the hot weather, so he lay on a rattan couch at the entrance of his shop. When Cao saw that Jiang was asleep, he thought the time had come, but he was afraid that the kitchen knife was not strong enough, so he replaced it with a large knife used for chopping meat, weighing eight catties, jumped forward, and slashed Jiang's right abdomen. In an instant, his abdomen broke and his intestines flowed out, and the wound was about six inches long. Fresh blood flowed straight, and he died. However, Cao was still afraid that he was not dead, so he slashed his right chest again, discarded the large knife, and fled. The police officers at the scene heard the news and rushed to the scene. Cao had already fled without a trace, so he was not arrested. He immediately reported the situation to Yi, the head of the first district and one station, and ordered his subordinates to strictly investigate and arrest the fugitive murderer Cao Changlin, and ordered the local head to report to the court to send personnel to examine the body.</p>
<p>Her body was covered with injuries. Such cruel behavior is truly inhumane. Therefore, it aroused public indignation, and Luo Jihen, who lived with her, and Huang Yuncong, Hua Weizhi, Jiang Heshen, Zhou Yongfu, and others who lived next door, prepared a public report, jointly responsible, and affixed their seals to report to police officer Su Shize of post No. 28, who forwarded it to the first district and second branch for investigation. Chief Liu immediately dispatched police chief Li Hongqing to rush to the scene, and took Gao Wangshi and the injured girl to the station. After questioning, it was learned that the girl Xiaomaotou was abused and beaten by her guardian Gao Wangshi, which aroused public outrage. An examination revealed that Xiaomaotou's body was covered with burn wounds and beatings, such inhumane cruelty is rare. Moreover, after being reported by a responsible person, it was decided to send her to the Public Security Bureau for strict investigation according to law, and the girl was sent to the hall for care, in order to save her life.</p>

He has borrowed money from Luo more than once. At about 5:00 PM the afternoon before, Pan went to the tofu shop to borrow 50 yuan from Luo Gengsheng, but was unsuccessful. They quarreled with each other. Pan Sanzi said that if he did not agree, he would have to give him one of his legs. Luo was very angry when he heard this and called the police officers on duty to arrest Pan and take him to the Yangshupu Police Station for detention. The next morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The attorney of the Public Works Department, Ru Baoyi, recounted the previous situation and questioned the defendant's confession, saying that he had borrowed ten dollars from the plaintiff because his wife had died, and there was no talk of borrowing legs. Luo Gengsheng insisted that he had said this at the time and asked for an investigation. Judge Xiao ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled to summon his sister to testify and verify the matter.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3 id="e199">On the Philosophy of Life <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Why do people come into the world? Is it for enjoyment? To transform society? Or for other reasons? Many readers have written to ask about this question. The readers who raise this question all feel that they don't know what attitude to take towards life. In other words, they cannot determine their own philosophy of life.</p>
<p>Speaking about life in a vague and general way will never yield any results. A person suddenly comes into the world for a trip, and then suddenly dies after a few decades. If they encounter illness or disaster along the way, they may lose their life before even reaching those decades. In their own life, they sometimes commit sins and sometimes accomplish great things, but they all come naked and return empty-handed. If you ask what it's all for, it's really impossible to say for sure. Since we can't say why, doesn't that mean that life is not worth the slightest bit of attachment? Yet the reality is not like that. Everyone is attached to their own life, and everyone hopes to prolong their own life. What do they want to do by prolonging it? Again, no one can give a reason.</p>
<p>Therefore, hedonistic poets like Li Bai and Su Shi say: "Life is nothing more than a dream, meaningless. Let's enjoy ourselves and indulge in the intoxication of dreams!" But if they believe that life is a dream, a deceiving illusion, then why be attached to the intoxication of dreams? Why not just commit suicide and avoid a meaningless existence of being drunk in life and dreaming of death? This is the contradiction of hedonists, and they cannot answer it themselves.</p>
<p>Philosophers of idealism say that life is meaningful, and people should adhere to a supreme moral ideal to live their lives, strive for this ideal, and sacrifice for it. Life is not important; what is important is the moral ideal. But if we pursue the matter to the end and ask: Yes, assuming that life is for this moral ideal, why must we come for the sake of the ideal? Everyone is born the same way and dies the same way. People with ideals do not necessarily live a few decades longer, and people without ideals do not necessarily fail to survive. Why must there be ideals? Why is it not okay to have no ideals? This is also an unanswerable contradiction.</p>
<p>Therefore, talking about life in a vague and general way will not lead to any results. We must find the meaning of life in concrete facts.</p>
<p>In fact, the first important condition for a person in the world is the society in which they are born. Everyone is born in a specific society; no one lives in the sky. Society precedes the individual, so the individual's life and actions are all determined by the social situation. People in feudal societies have the characteristics of feudal life, and people in capitalist societies also have their own special lives. And in these two societies, people are divided into different classes due to differences in status and property, and each class has its own life.</p>
<p>Each society and each class has its own special life, and these various special lives form various special thoughts. For example, nobles and monarchs in feudal societies have a particularly superior right, and their lives are built on this superior right. Therefore, they hope that people respect their privilege, which gives rise to the ideas of privilege and loyalty to the monarch. In their view, the duty of loyalty to the monarch is more important than life itself. The idea of loyalty is a typical philosophy of life in the feudal order. For example, in capitalist society, the lives of capitalists are based on capital and property relations, so they attach particular importance to capital and wealth. They believe that capital and property are more important than feudal privileges. Therefore, during the French Revolution, they raised the banner of freedom and equality to oppose the privilege system. Their lives made them develop the ideas of freedom and equality (of course, their freedom and equality could only be enjoyed with property and capital, so this freedom and equality was a false freedom and equality). Freedom and equality became their philosophy of life. (But this only refers to the capitalists of the first half of the nineteenth century.)</p>
<p>In this way, we can know that a person's philosophy of life is determined by their social environment. The aforementioned semi-pessimistic and semi-hedonistic philosophy of life of Li Bai and Su Shi represents the lives of those frustrated scholar-officials in the feudal era. If you ask vaguely what life is for, you will get nothing in the end. But if we focus on society, we can know that when a person is born into the world, their purpose is the purpose stipulated by the society in which they live. The answer to why life exists lies here.</p>
<p>However, society is made up of everyone. Everything in society is the sum of human behavior. Although individual behavior is essentially determined by the conditions of the whole society, people are not completely passive. Within a certain range, there can still be relative freedom. Although our philosophy of life is largely a product of society, there are various classes and various lives in a certain society, and there is not only one kind of philosophy of life. There is room for us to choose. We must choose the most correct philosophy of life as our compass for life.</p>
<p>The method of selection was debated by many scholars in China's "Debate on Science and Philosophy of Life" ten years ago. Among them, one faction advocated choosing with free will, arguing that there is no fixed standard for the philosophy of life. We certainly do not agree with this. We believe that we must find a standard to determine the most correct world view.</p>
<p>To have a correct philosophy of life, we must first have a correct understanding of society. To have a correct understanding of society, we must study social sciences. In this sense, we can say that the philosophy of life should be determined by science.</p>
<p>As for asking: Is life for enjoyment? Is it to transform society? This question is not very important. As long as we have a correct knowledge of social science, then these questions will naturally be easily solved.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Qiu Feihai Defeats Ota <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Wins Two Sets Consecutively, 6-4, 6-2</p>
<p>Ota Meets His Match, Utterly Helpless</p>
<p>Today Old Qiu Will Play Ota Again at Kangti Road</p>
<p>Ota, a former representative from the All-Japan Taikai Cup, etc., gave his second performance in Shanghai yesterday. Ota, who had defeated Lin Baohua the day before, played against Qiu Feihai yesterday. Qiu unexpectedly defeated Ota two sets to zero, winning easily 6-4, 6-2. The applause from the audience shook the sky. Qiu Feihai's performance yesterday reached its peak, with many wonderful moments, causing Ota to fall into a state of utter helplessness. In the doubles match, Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia defeated Kotera Yoshizo 6-3, 6-3, also very easily. In another singles match, Carlson defeated Kotera two sets to one, 2-6, 6-3, 6-3. Today, Ota and others will perform at the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club on Kangti Road, where Ota will play Qiu Feihai again. On Wednesday, they will perform at the Chinese Lawn Tennis Club. Yesterday's match report is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e203">Lin and Zheng Win in Doubles <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>In the doubles match, Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia played against Kotera and Yoshida. Watanabe, who was originally scheduled to participate, was absent due to other commitments. Lin and Zheng won two sets consecutively, 6-3, 6-3, in an instant. Kotera was passable, but Yoshida was weak and incompetent, with many mistakes. Their skills were far apart. Lin served first, and the opponent won. Kotera served, and Lin and Zheng won four games in a row, taking the lead 4-1 effortlessly. In the fifth game, Lin served and won with a slip game, resulting in 5-2 and then 6-3, with Lin and Zheng winning the first set. In the second set, Kotera served first, and the server won each game, until the seventh game after 3-3, when Yoshida's serve was broken. Lin and Zheng then won four games in a row, 6-3, winning the second set again.</p>
<p>Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia (6-3, 6-3) Kotera and Yoshida</p>
<h3 id="e204">Qiu Feihai Overcomes Ota <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Same Stroke Style: Qiu Feihai and Ota have completely identical stroke styles, with long baseline rallies going back and forth, sweeping diagonally across the court. Qiu Feihai occasionally went to the net a few times. Ota also switched to going to the net after failing in a rally yesterday, but it was ineffective. Therefore, the two were like a pair of sticky candies, causing laughter throughout the court.</p>
<p>Old Qiu's Masterpiece: Yesterday's match was entirely a confrontation of long baseline rallies. Whoever could maintain their composure and avoid panic would gain the final victory. This battle was nothing short of a triumphant masterpiece for Qiu Feihai in his life. His shots were stable, rarely going out of bounds. His diagonal shots landed deep in the corner, causing Ota to struggle. Ota's only weapon, his powerful forehand, was also ineffective yesterday. Qiu was able to respond to his various shots, while Ota became even more chaotic afterward, leading to a complete collapse.</p>
<p>Two 5-0s: Yesterday, the two ships almost had the same situation. Qiu Feihai led 5-0 in the first set, and the second set was also in the same situation, 5-0. Old Qiu's momentum was surprisingly strong, and both sets had the potential to be 6-0. Qiu Feihai served first, with baseline rallies going back and forth, one shot going back and forth about a dozen or twenty times. The first game ended after four deuces, with Qiu winning. Ota started to show his panic after failing in the intense first game. Qiu took advantage of the momentum and won five games in a row. Although Ota was angry in the fourth game and swung his powerful forehand, it had no effect. After 5-0, Ota made a desperate effort. Qiu had the lead 40-15 twice, but Ota won, making it 5-4. Ota served in the tenth game but failed to maintain it, and Qiu won 6-4.</p>
<p>Ota Succumbs: Starting from the second set, Ota was exhausted, and his shots lacked confidence. Even the easiest shots were sent into the net. He declined rapidly and was beyond salvation. Old Qiu repeatedly won five games in a row, putting Ota in a desperate situation. Although Ota tried his best to win back two games, Qiu Feihai won the final game with a slip game, winning the second set again 6-2.</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai (6-4, 6-2) Ota</p>
<h3 id="e205">Carlson Defeats Kotera <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The last singles match, Carlson vs. Kotera, was no longer as tense and exciting. Kotera is a junior champion in Japan, young and skilled. His shots are stable, and the diagonal shots and the landing points of the ball are unpredictable. He won the first set 6-2 against Carlson, but he gradually showed panic afterward. Carlson won the next two sets 6-3, 6-3.</p>
<p>Carlson (2-6, 6-3, 6-3) Kotera</p>
<h3 id="e206">Today at Kangti Road <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>

<p>North China Swimming Competition Concluded Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e210">Hebei Wins Men's Team Championship <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Sweeps All Women's Events to Win Championship</p>
<p>Women's 100-Meter Freestyle Breaks North China Record</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Peiping, 12th) The 12th was the second day of the North China Swimming Competition. The finals began at 8:30 AM. The number of spectators decreased slightly. A refreshing autumn breeze blew in the morning, and athletes from various regions engaged in the final battle in the rippling blue waves. The atmosphere was quite tense. Although Qingdao had hopes for the championship, their swimming skills were insufficient, and the sea monster Yan Renying did not participate. Their strength was lacking. However, Dong Jingchun was calm and experienced, and gained unexpected results. In the finals of various events, except for He Wenya's 100-meter freestyle, which broke the North China record, there were no other special achievements. As a result, Hebei won the first place in the men's team total score. Qingdao only won the first place in the women's team total score. Shandong suffered a disastrous defeat and returned. Only Zhou Changying from the four units of the Northeast worked hard, but it was to no avail. The entire competition was completed at 12:00 noon. The closing ceremony was held. The chairman, Yuan Liang, delegated the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Cai Yuan, to represent him due to other commitments. The ceremony was performed as scheduled. Afterwards, Cai gave a speech, expressing his deep apologies for the inadequate facilities. After the speech, he invited Mrs. He Yingqin, Wang Wenxiang, to present the awards. The closing ceremony ended successfully at 1:30 PM. At 4:00 PM, Yuan Liang hosted a banquet for all athletes and officials of the competition at the Municipal Government. Qingdao athletes planned to visit various scenic spots starting on the 13th and take the train south on the evening of the 14th. Hebei athletes would return to Tianjin in triumph on the 13th. Shandong would also return to Jinan on the same train.</p>
<p>(Peiping, 12th) The North China Swimming Competition continued at the swimming pool from 8:30 AM on the morning of the 12th. There were nearly 1,000 spectators, slightly less than on the 11th. Athletes from various units took the field on time. However, many representatives from Shandong Province did not arrive, with only two participating. By 12:00 noon, all events had been completed. Only Qingdao female athlete He Wenya broke the North China record in the 100-foot freestyle with a time of one minute and ten seconds. After the competition, the closing ceremony was held, and Mrs. He Yingqin, Wang Wenxiang, personally presented the awards. At 4:00 PM, Yuan Liang hosted a tea party at the Municipal Government to entertain the athletes and staff from various provinces and cities. On the evening of the 12th, Hebei athletes returned to Tianjin, and Shandong athletes returned to Jinan on the 13th. Qingdao athletes took a short tour and returned to Qingdao on the 14th. In the overall results, Hebei dominated the men's division, and Qingdao naturally won the championship in the women's division due to the absence of competitors.</p>
<p>(Peiping, 12th) Team Total Score: (1) Hebei 56 points, (2) Qingdao 51 points, (3) Jin 22 points, (4) Ping 9 points, (5) Lu 1 point. In the women's division, only Qingdao participated, 45 points. Individual Total Score: Men's Division, (1) Dong Jingchun (Hebei) 15 points, (2) Song Delu (Qingdao) 9 points, (3) Sun Xiwen (Qingdao) 8 points. Women's Division, He Wenjin 16 points, He Wenya 9 points. A total of four silver shields were awarded, one by He Yingqin, one by the Political Council, and two by Yuan Liang. Hebei and Qingdao each received two. The Northeast Sports Association presented a championship flag to Ping.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Recent Reforms in Secondary Education (Part 1) <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Talks with Persons in Charge of the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>Recently, there has been much social commentary on the secondary education system. A reporter went to the Ministry of Education to inquire about the ministry's views. An important official of the ministry then gave a responsible statement, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>The attitude of society recently is clearly different from that of a few years ago. In the past, everyone only respected education in words. In practice, everyone did not pay attention to education funding, school atmosphere, or the establishment or closure of schools. Recently, people in society have paid very close attention to education. This phenomenon may be a premonition of major educational reforms, which we find deeply gratifying. The Ministry and local education administrative authorities, as well as all those engaged in education, should carefully consider and accept criticisms or suggestions from all parties. However, critics are sometimes not very clear about the content of the current system and other facts. Therefore, the following is a separate explanation of various recent facts related to secondary education, so that those who discuss them can better understand the content of the system and the reform plans that have been carried out, which will make all discussions more beneficial.</p>
<h3 id="e213">(1) Problems with the Secondary Education System <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Previously, the secondary education system adopted a system of merging middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools. Junior high schools could also set up vocational courses, and senior high schools could combine ordinary normal schools and vocational courses. This system confused the facilities of various types of education and diversified the objectives. As a result, middle school education could not develop, and normal school vocational education was mostly empty. This is an obvious historical vestige. In the past, the reason for advocating the merger of middle schools was that middle schools with vocational and normal school courses would make it easier for students to transfer and adapt, which was suitable for the development of personality, the so-called horizontal and vertical activity system. However, in practice, vocational skills were not fully cultivated, and normal school education did not have professional training, which led to a gradual decline in standards. As a result, the three objectives of making a living, teaching, and going to higher education could not be achieved. In view of the above facts, the Ministry has recently completely separated normal and vocational education from the scope of middle schools, so that ordinary middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools are established separately, with clear objectives and strict training. Ordinary middle schools continue primary school training and serve as a ladder for the study of advanced academics. Normal schools cultivate sound primary school teachers and provide professional training. Vocational schools cultivate the skills of young people to make a living, enabling them to be self-reliant in production. In this way, the complete purpose of ordinary middle schools can be achieved, and the mission undertaken by vocational normal schools can be completed. Therefore, in terms of the current system, the so-called secondary education actually includes three types of separately established schools: middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools.</p>
<h3 id="e214">(2) The Problem of the Distribution of Middle School Education Funds <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the state of secondary education shows that general middle schools are developing exceptionally rapidly, while vocational and normal education are making little progress, especially vocational education. This is a major ailment in recent secondary education, and society is blaming it partly on this. The Ministry of Education's reform of secondary education has also focused on this point recently. According to the 1930 statistical report on secondary education, the number of general middle schools accounts for approximately two-thirds of the total number of secondary schools, the funding accounts for approximately three-quarters, and the number of students exceeds three-quarters. However, the number of vocational schools is less than one-tenth, the funding is only one-tenth, and the number of students is less than seven percent. Even these few vocational schools mostly have crude and simple content and equipment. This kind of distorted development of secondary education not only leads to a lack of qualified teachers in primary schools, but also prevents middle school graduates whose family circumstances or academic abilities limit them from pursuing further education from engaging in occupations because general middle schools (whose main purpose is preparatory training for further education) lack training in production skills. If this continues, not only will the entire secondary education system fail, but also the most serious social problems of the present will inevitably increase day by day. Since the Ministry of Education has adopted the principle of independent establishment for the three types of secondary schools, and in view of the above-mentioned serious situation, it cannot but correct the development trends of secondary education. Therefore, after investigating the actual situation in various provinces and cities last autumn, it formulated standards for the establishment and funding allocation of secondary schools in various provinces and cities, in order to correct the distorted development of the past. The established funding allocation standards stipulate that the funding for vocational schools in each province and city should not be lower than 35% of the total budget for secondary education, the funding for normal schools should not be lower than 25%, and the funding for general middle schools should be limited to 40%. It is also stipulated that each province and city must revise its education budget in accordance with this principle before the beginning of the 1934 fiscal year, establish and formulate a specific plan for phased implementation, and fully achieve the above-mentioned standards before the 1937 fiscal year. It is also stipulated that the new funding after the 1934 fiscal year should be used primarily for vocational and normal education. Those who fail to increase their funding should gradually reduce the corresponding amount of funding for middle schools from the existing funding to expand vocational and normal education. However, the reduction in the number of middle schools must still take into account the balanced development of middle school education throughout the territory and its performance. Currently, the provinces and cities that have followed the Ministry's order to handle and carefully determine the phased reform plan based on the budgetary situation of the province include Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Anhui, Henan, Fujian, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Yunnan, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Weihaiwei, Chahar, and Beijing. Other provinces and cities, such as Hebei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Shandong, Gansu, Shanghai, and Qingdao, have also drafted and submitted plans, which are being revised by the Ministry of Education and will be completed soon. If this reform is completed, the distorted state of secondary education in the future can be changed, and the goal of production education can be partially realized. (To be continued)</p>

<p>| Mayor Wu Chaired, Yan Huiqing, Li Zhaohuan, Pan Gongzhan, Mu Ouchu, and Liu Zhanen Spoke in Succession |</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and 34 other groups of the Global Chinese Students Federation held a send-off meeting for this year's students studying abroad at the New Asia Restaurant Hall yesterday afternoon. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The attendees included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Ambassador to Russia Yan Huiqing, Municipal Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, Jiaotong University President Li Zhaohuan, Shanghai University President Liu Zhanen, Local Association Mu Ouchu, Aviation Association Lin Wojiang, Municipal Education Bureau Ma Chonggan, Yang Zhi of the Global Students Federation, Zhu Shaoping, Zhang You of Fudan University, Liao Maoru of Guanghua University, Huang Zhaoxiong and Xu Zeyu of the Municipal Education Association, Shi She of the China Vocational Education Society, Chen Jicheng and Xu Zexiang of the China School Education Federation, Liu Zhanen of the International Problems Research Association, Ma Chonggan of Shen Bao, Hu Shuyi of Xinwen Bao, Xia Kaiming of Shishi Xinbao, Xu Zexiang of Chen Bao, Zhu Yixin of Min Bao, Xia Menghuan of Zhonghua Daily, Li Dachao of Zhongshan Cultural and Educational Center, Wu Hanfang and Xu Xingchu of the International Society, Lin Jun of the French Literature Society, Chen Kecheng of the Municipal Government, Huang Jingwan of Commercial Press, Xu Jian of Datong, Shen Siqi of the World, Gu Benfan of the Mainland News, and US Consul General Kenningham, Deputy Consul Anya, Commercial Counselor Shi Fanglai, Belgian Consul Fang Fei, Deputy Consul He Naier, and students studying abroad Wu Youlin, Wang Yukai, etc., more than 300 people,</p>
<p>Send-off Situation The meeting started at 4:00 p.m., chaired by Mayor Wu, recorded by the Chinese Shorthand Society, foreign guests received by Zhu Shaoping and Yang Qian, students studying abroad received by Wu Deyi and Ye Xinan, etc. After the formal ceremony, Mayor Wu delivered the opening speech, followed by Yan Huiqing, Li Zhaohuan, Pan Gongzhan, Mu Ouchu, Liu Zhanen, etc., who spoke in succession. Next, Guan Xing, Cai Shaoxu, Jiang Dingxian, Chen Youxin, etc. sang solos, piano and violin solos. Next, student representatives Wu Youlin and Wang Yukai replied. The Global Students Federation presented a guide to staying abroad, and Hua An Society sent the Huamei Monthly. Finally, refreshments were served and a photo was taken before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech Chairman Mayor Wu Tiecheng delivered the opening speech, saying, "Today is the send-off of this year's students studying abroad by various groups in Shanghai. Shanghai is a transportation hub, so students from all over the country who go abroad every year mostly pass through Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai has a send-off every year. In recent years, China has been plagued by internal and external troubles, and all the many students going abroad to study is a hopeful thing for China's future, because China has been suffering from internal and external troubles and needs to cultivate a large number of useful people to save the country and solve the current major difficulties. You are going abroad to study, not to seek a degree, but to seek knowledge. Going abroad to seek knowledge means being able to apply what you have learned. Therefore, you have two tasks in studying abroad: the first is to seek knowledge, and the second is to observe. Seeking knowledge is to apply it, and we should catch up with the advanced countries. There are many things in European and American countries that can be imitated, but there must be a distinction, and what is the reason for the rapid progress of European and American countries in economy, politics, and education, and why is the progress so fast, is also what you should know. Therefore, in addition to seeking knowledge, you must also observe. In the past, many students who returned from studying abroad failed, and the reason was that they forgot to observe when they were studying abroad. Today, I, on behalf of various groups, offer some advice to the ambitious youth. I hope that you will use the great spirit of our ancestors' culture to create China, revive the nation, and build a strong Republic of China."</p>
<p>Yan's Speech Yan Huiqing's speech briefly stated, "This time, I came to Shanghai from Qingdao to send my little daughter to study in the United States. I am very honored to attend this grand meeting. After I returned to China from Soviet Russia this time, I saw that many Chinese people were pessimistic and felt that China's future had little hope. But seeing this grand meeting today makes me recall the situation when I left Shanghai for the United States forty years ago. Compared with that, I cannot help but be very optimistic. China's current education is much more advanced than it was forty years ago. Now I will tell you about my own experience. First, when you go abroad, don't be afraid because you are a Chinese student. We should treat ourselves as equal to American students. Our China is a country with thousands of years of culture, and it is not something to be ashamed of. We must be bold in seeking knowledge and doing things when we return to China in the future. Second, in addition to studying when we go abroad, we should also participate in extracurricular activities, whether they are games, sports, literary societies, debates, etc., that are related to the school. We should also go to see foreign museums, theaters, churches, and even the situation in foreign families. Only when we know the political, social, educational, and religious situation of foreign countries and study them can we achieve the purpose of studying abroad. Third, why did many Chinese students fail in the past? Because they were too rigid in their studies abroad and could not expand the knowledge of one country to another country. But no matter what country it is, it has its own system. On the one hand, we should study knowledge, and on the other hand, we should pay attention to bringing the advantages of foreign countries to China, so that it can be sinicized, and the Republic of China can be strong."</p>
<p>Compilation of Speeches (1) Li Zhaohuan's speech was divided into three points: (1) Today we are sending you off because you are the representatives of the youth. I hope that after you go abroad, you must work hard to study and make a name for yourselves to win glory for the country. (2) We are sending you off, hoping that you will have a desire to create, not a desire to lead. (3) You are the top talents among university students, and you should take it as your responsibility to revitalize Chinese culture, nation, education, industry, and commerce. (2) Pan Gongzhan's speech briefly stated that parting has always been sad and heartbreaking, but today's farewell is filled with joy and hope because you are going abroad to study with a major mission and bear the great responsibility of revitalizing Chinese culture. The backwardness of Chinese culture today goes without saying, but building a new culture requires new materials and new methods, which we especially hope you will work hard on. Finally, I hope you will have three attitudes when you go abroad to study: self-respect, self-effacement, and self-esteem. (3) Mu Ouchu's speech was divided into (1) having the power of observation, (2) not being pessimistic, but being optimistic, and (3) paying attention to physical training. (4) Liu Zhanen's speech stated that today I will only give you one word, which is "do." I hope that you will practice the word "do" abroad, and also practice the word "do" after you return to China, not to get promoted and make a fortune, but to seek the welfare of the people.</p>

<p>Student Replies (1) Wu Youlin's reply briefly stated that there are more than 100 students studying abroad this time, with the most going to the United States. We are mostly going abroad for the first time, and we have not observed the customs and habits comprehensively. We have benefited a lot from listening to the instructions of the gentlemen. (2) Wang Yukai's reply briefly stated that we are very honored to be summoned by you all today to hold a meeting to send us off. We are willing to regard your teachings as precious and never lose them, and we will work hard in our studies so that we can make contributions after returning to China and win glory for the country. Now there are two points to report: (1) The Hoover President's Student Group will hold a committee meeting at 4:00 p.m. on the 14th to discuss everything. (2) I have just received a telegram from the Chinese Consul in Lausanne that he will come to San Francisco to meet and take care of us together with the consulate staff, so that we can avoid trouble and land safely.</p>

<p>Satisfactory Results of Negotiating Education Fees in Beijing</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th Dispatch) Hunan Education Director Zhu Jingnong arrived in Beijing from Jiangxi. According to the Central News Agency reporter, the mission in Beijing: (1) The expenses of more than 23,000 primary schools in the province require 7 million yuan. The income from local tax deductions accounts for about one-third. If it is abolished once, more than one-third of the schools will be closed. It is proposed to temporarily retain it by the central government. (2) Hunan's monthly cost of 108,000 yuan of salt tax surcharge accounts for 65 percent. After the surcharge is stopped, it is proposed to pay from the regular tax. He has received replies from President Wang and both Ministers Wang and Kong, and the results are satisfactory. Zhu is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the evening of the 12th, stay for a day or two, and take a boat back to Hunan.</p>

<h3 id="e223">The Future of Silk Industry Control <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Hanchen</p>
<p>The fundamental forms of the silk industry crisis are: firstly, the price of cocoons is as cheap as mud, exceeding the limit that farmers can tolerate for unpaid labor; secondly, the weakness of economic capacity determines that farmers can only desperately abandon the cultivation of improved varieties and replace them with local varieties; and thirdly, farmers abandon or reduce silkworm rearing, resulting in the rapid destruction of mulberry fields and the conversion to other crops. This trend has been more vigorously promoted in the process of ending this year's spring cocoon market. The fundamental decline of the silk reeling industry and the accelerated development of agricultural panic in various forms: In the face of these interactive fundamental threats, the main sideline of the rural areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the silk industry, its future is truly precarious!</p>
<p>The government has long paid great attention to reversing this decline. For example, the National Economic Commission has specially established the Silk Industry Control Committee to undertake this mission. Other examples include Zhejiang, which has been silently implementing its control policy for more than a year under the management of institutions such as the Committee for Managing Improved Sericulture. Since this spring, Jiangsu, under the leadership of the Department of Construction, has also organized the Sericulture Improvement Committee to vigorously promote the control of the entire province's silk industry. With the joint agreement of the Ministries of Finance and Industry and the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to formulate a plan to save the silk industry, more specific provisions have been made for its implementation. In addition to relatively minor measures such as encouraging mulberry planting, improving mulberry gardens, and improving technology, its main direction is to proceed under the two major goals of cocoon market control and silkworm seed control. The control policy has become the government's fundamental plan to resolve the current silk industry crisis, which is already an unquestionable event.</p>
<p>In the plan submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministries of Finance and Industry, there is a proposal to improve the method of cocoon collection, aiming to liberate farmers from the exploitation of usury and the middle layer of commercial capitalists, and to "take direct trade between farmers and silk factories as the principle." However, in reality, the control of cocoon markets is clearly not based on this "principle." Its motivation is more or less related to the current financial crisis. Therefore, the control law stipulated by the Jiangsu Department of Construction naturally shifts its focus to articles such as "compelling cocoon collectors to pay a deposit of three yuan per load" (Article 6) and "collecting an improvement fee of twelve yuan for each load of dried cocoons collected" (Article 8)! The relationship between this type of control law, which is purely for increasing tax revenue, and the salvation of the silk industry crisis is truly elusive!</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Fifth Congress of the Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Improvement Committee passed thirteen "severe crackdown" measures in order to suppress the cocoon market's resistance to control. Among them, Article 4 states, "If any cocoon collector's daily cocoon collection report is found to have underreported the amount, the underreported portion of the cocoons will be confiscated and forfeited to the public." Article 5 states, "If any cocoon collector's cocoons have not been reported for a dried cocoon transport request form and a dried cocoon fee payment certificate and a dried cocoon pass have not been issued, and they transport the cocoons without authorization, the portion transported without a certificate will be confiscated and forfeited to the public." These measures are clearly designed to prevent merchants from evading payment, thus also implying that the specific content of the so-called cocoon market control is actually to collect a disguised tax. Article 9 of the measures also stipulates, "Anyone who impersonates cocoons from model improvement areas as cocoons from ordinary areas in an attempt to avoid paying the sericulture improvement fee will have all of their cocoons confiscated and forfeited to the public." Thus, the only difference between cocoons produced in the so-called model improvement areas and those in ordinary areas is that they have paid an additional fee. Therefore, in the current trend of the government actively promoting sericulture rescue measures by dividing areas, there is the bizarre phenomenon of silk cocoon merchants in Jiangyin County sending a telegram to the Ministry of Industry and the Rural Reconstruction Commission opposing the county's designation as an improvement area and demanding confirmation as an ordinary area. The shadows under the current cocoon market control policy are truly alarming!</p>
<p>In fact, there is not much difference in opinion between the government and the cocoon merchants. Merchants do not need to say anything else except that the policy increases the tax rate, and they do not need to oppose control. Therefore, when the Jiangsu cocoon market's resistance to the control measures caused a great uproar this spring, it was quickly resolved because the government accepted three measures, including "paying an improvement fee of three yuan per load of dried cocoons." However, apart from the huge new tax revenue, it is an issue that we should not ignore whether cocoon market control has reduced the various monopolies and manipulations suffered by farmers from commercial capitalists, or whether it has enabled silk reeling factories to reduce their "cocoon costs" without "cocoon merchants circulating and selling in between."</p>
<p>In this year's spring cocoon market, farmers were still or even more severely exploited by cocoon merchants' monopoly of cocoon prices. The cocoon market guilds in Wuxi, Jiangyin, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Haining, and other places determined the maximum price of cocoons long before the opening of the market, and they all had more or less influence on the cocoon market. In Jintan County, in order to implement cocoon market control, the twenty-seven cocoon markets were merged into four, all of which were monopolized by large merchants, who were able to arbitrarily lower prices. As a result, the masses of farmers rose up in resistance, triggering bloody riots. The same facts also reappeared in Xiaoshan (see Daily News in June). The exploitation function of commercial capitalists has not been affected in any way by the vigorous implementation of cocoon market control. In the process of merchants passing on the improvement fees they pay to farmers, they will naturally need to further promote the function of monopoly and price cutting. In this way, cocoon market control has become a policy far removed from the masses of farmers. In addition to painfully selling their cocoons at prices lower than the market price, farmers have no choice but to dry their cocoons and reel silk at home, hoping without any guarantee that the silk market will rebound to save them!</p>
<p>We can easily deduce how much capacity the government's cocoon market control policy, which is implemented in the cocoon sales market, has to save the silk industry panic from its fundamental direction and actual situation.</p>
<p>Of course, in the government's entire system of saving the sericulture industry, its main goal is placed in the silkworm cocoon production process in order to achieve fundamental liberation. Improving silkworm breeds is considered the first step, and silkworm seed control is the concrete means of implementation. But what are the results?</p>
<p>The extreme poverty of the entire rural area and the plummeting price of cocoons make it impossible for farmers to dream of improving the silkworm rearing process. Poverty prompts them to yearn for a good cocoon harvest, while at the same time fundamentally destroying their hope. Farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are generally rapidly returning to rearing local varieties because they have no cash to buy expensive improved silkworm seeds. This situation can be seen in the overproduction of improved varieties this spring. Not only were there two or three hundred thousand more silkworm seeds than needed in Jiangsu Province, but there were also eighty thousand more in Zhejiang Province, which implemented control, and they could not be sold. Silkworm seed control can to some extent force people to rear improved varieties, but it cannot overcome the poverty of farmers, which is the core of the problem!</p>
<p>At present, Jiangsu Province is actively carrying out silkworm seed control and has promulgated eight control measures, which will be implemented in model improvement areas starting in the autumn of the 23rd year of the Republic. The main measures are: (1) Each silkworm household must submit a form reporting the number of silkworm seeds required by June 30 for autumn seeds and October 31 for spring seeds; (2) The seed payment for autumn seeds must be remitted before July 20 of the same year, and the seed payment for spring seeds must be remitted before December 31 of the previous year; (3) After the seed payment in the preceding paragraph is received, silkworm seeds will be allocated according to the seed price paid, but the quantity of seeds received by each silkworm household shall not exceed the quantity reported in advance, and no seeds may be claimed after the deadline. Another most important thing is the unified seed price, which is uniformly five cents per sheet. According to the seed price in Wuxi this spring, the best ones, such as the Tiger brand seeds produced by Dayou Seed Farm, have fallen in price to seven cents, and the Shou Xing and other brands are only selling for four cents per sheet. So how much seed price preference can farmers now get from silkworm seed control? In the above three seed selling methods, the government is indeed very convenient in carrying out its work. It does not have to bear the risk of seed price arrears, nor does it have the drawbacks of inconsistency between silkworm seed production and sales. But there will never be two opposing parties benefiting at the same time. In order for the government to conveniently carry out its so-called control, the burden on farmers has turned into an unexpected increase in responsibility. Under the threat of extreme fluctuations in the market price of silk, the amount of autumn silkworm rearing must be decided by farmers before June 30; even the amount of silkworms that will begin to be raised in March of the following year must now be decided before October of the previous year. Regardless of whether farmers have the ability to make such a decision, the third method forces them to blindly decide; otherwise, they will no longer have any silkworm seeds to receive. Farmers need to bear all the losses of rearing more or less during this long period. In particular, the second method, regarding the pre-deadline payment of seed funds, simply makes it impossible for farmers to accept the good intentions of silkworm seed control. Farmers must pay the seed funds several months before receiving the silkworm seeds. In this way, farmers who are trapped in extreme poverty in the entire agricultural panic are either more oppressed and fall deeper into the clutches of usurers, or they are forced to give up the opportunity to continue silkworm rearing. The facts will tell us after the autumn silkworm rearing begins.</p>
<p>For general ordinary areas, the Jiangsu Province sells silkworm seeds publicly, and the price is one cent higher per sheet (i.e., six cents) (see Article 4, Item B, Paragraph 2 of the control regulations). In addition, there are so-called special circumstances in improved areas, where the selling price is increased by two cents per sheet, i.e., seven cents (same as above, Item C). This difference in public sale prices between model areas and ordinary areas is clearly due to the fact that the government has collected huge improvement fees in the model areas. The blood relationship between the collection of improvement fees and the public sale of silkworm seeds is thus!</p>
<p>Farmers are scattered, and they only silently answer with facts. But the burden that silkworm seed control imposes on merchants, they are not willing to accept silently. In June, the Jiangsu Provincial Government's method of purchasing autumn seeds was: "Selling in Jiangsu Province, each sheet is 7.5 cents, pay 5 cents first, for a total of 320,000 yuan, and the remaining 2.5 cents will be supplemented from the cocoon price after the cocoons are produced. 160,000 yuan can be allocated from the spring cocoon donation for this 320,000 yuan, and the rest will be allocated by the Department of Finance (see Da Wan Bao, June 24); however, recently, "The Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Improvement Association, in order to take into account the facts, has changed the method again to pay 1.5 cents per sheet first" (see Zhonghua Daily, August 7), which caused the Wuxi, Suzhou, and Wujin Silkworm Seed Industry Association to hold several meetings to oppose it, believing that "the provincial regulations are clearly contrary to the original decrees" and resolutely demanding "the abolition of the order to sell outside the province, and demanding that 5.5 cents per sheet be paid in advance for seed funds, otherwise they will refuse acid immersion." As a result of the petition, the responsible authorities replied: "Regarding the seed price, the Department has stipulated that 5 cents will be given first, excluding 1.5 cents, which has already been paid to each farm, and the remaining 2.5 cents will be re-issued depending on the results of the autumn cocoons" (both seen in the above report). At present, representatives from the three counties are still continuing to petition the province. But in this way, the government no longer needs to "allocate 180,000 yuan from the spring cocoon donation," and it is no longer necessary for the Department to pay 140,000 yuan. However, in order to obtain autumn seeds, farmers had to pay the seed funds to the "Sericulture Improvement Management Committee" at a price of 5 cents per sheet as early as July 20!</p>
<p>The silk industry must be rescued. In addition to measures such as increasing mulberry planting or improving technology, which are still on the planning books, cocoon market control and silkworm seed control have been vigorously promoted, but their future is as described above. Therefore, the solution to the silk industry crisis is still a problem for the Chinese farmers themselves! August 11.</p>

<p>— Xia Daoxiang</p>
<p>丨A Study of the Listing of Chinese Silk on the New York Commodity Exchange丨</p>
<p>In recent years, the export of Chinese silk has been hindered, and the market price of cocoons and silk has repeatedly fallen below the production cost. Farmers planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms have no profit, so they have dug up mulberry trees to plant other crops, resulting in a continuous decrease in cocoon production. Other seed production farms and silk factories have also declared closure and bankruptcy one after another due to operating losses, the number of which is countless. Tens of thousands of workers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and other places have lost their jobs. The entire silk industry is showing a declining phenomenon. Although the central and local governments have tried to save it, due to the trend of the world economic situation and the weak ability of domestic operators, it is difficult to make any recovery for a while. Just when the people in the national silk industry were sighing in unison, suddenly in May, the news came that the New York Commodity Exchange in the United States, which sells the most silk in the world, planned to list Chinese silk and Italian silk, and allow Chinese and Italian silk to be used instead of Japanese silk for delivery. This is actually a prelude to promoting the sale of Chinese silk to the United States.</p>
<p>Let's explore the motives of this matter and the process of its advancement. Although it is related to the United States itself, how can it be achieved without the promotion of other parties? After all, whether we have the power to promote it or not, we must study the recent situation of Chinese silk's international trade.</p>
<p>The export trade of Chinese silk has always been controlled by foreign merchants. In Shanghai, although several Chinese merchants, such as Hulin, Weicheng, Jingxing, and Tongyun, came out to operate in the past, they all declared closure one after another due to losses. Only Tongyun remains. Recently, Wuxi Yongtai Silk Factory has also sent personnel to the United States to negotiate silk sales, but it is only for the sake of its own silk production. With such weak exporters, how can they have the power to promote and publicize? In addition, the quality of Chinese silk exported to the United States is mixed, and the quantity is decreasing year by year. Now, according to the numbers recorded by the American Silk Association and our Chinese Customs, a table is listed below for reference:</p>
<p>Table of Chinese Silk Exports to the United States in the Last Eight Years (Survey by the American Silk Association, Unit: picul)</p>
<p>Year | Amount of Chinese Silk Exported to the United States | Total Amount of Raw Silk Imported by the United States from Various Countries | Percentage of Chinese Silk in the Total Raw Silk Imports of the United States</p>

<p>Total | 61,987 | 28,057 | 28,792 | 40,671 | 37,359 | 28,060 | 18,141</p>
<p>(Note) The numbers reported by the Customs are slightly different from those surveyed by the American Silk Association, presumably because a considerable number of Chinese silk exports are indirectly shipped to the United States.</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that Chinese silk exports to the United States amount to only tens of thousands of bales per year, and the types include white and yellow filature silk, white and yellow reeled silk, and gray silk. Moreover, since 1932, the exports have decreased from 60,000-70,000 bales to more than 20,000 bales. Although the reason is said to be the impact of economic recession and rayon, how can we know that it is not caused by the poor quality of Chinese silk! With such a small quantity and mixed quality of Chinese silk, how can it arouse the sympathy of the American silk industry and be promoted?</p>
<p>So, where is the driving force behind this matter? In my opinion, it is in Italy. Why do I say that? Since Prime Minister Mussolini came to power in that country, he has vigorously promoted the revitalization of rural areas, improved trade, and encouraged the silk industry. The output of raw silk has increased year by year, from more than 4 million pounds to more than 10 million pounds. Recently, an emergency relief policy has been implemented, giving silk producers a reward of three lire per kilogram of fresh cocoons. Moreover, for the export of raw silk, international management is sought, and European countries are united to prevent the import of East Asian raw silk (Japanese silk), in order to increase the consumption of Italian and French silk. At the same time, for the export of Italian silk to the United States, various publicity and on-site improvements have been carried out, and the exports have increased sharply from 2,700 bales to more than 19,000 bales, an increase of more than seven times. The recent amount of Italian silk exported to the United States is recorded below:</p>
<p>Table of Italian Silk Exports to the United States in Recent Years (Unit: bale)</p>
<p>Year | Amount of Italian Raw Silk Imported | Total Amount of Raw Silk Imported by the United States | Percentage of Italian Silk in the Total Imports of the United States</p>
<p>1929-1930 | 19,702 | 615,052 | 3%</p>
<p>1930-1931 | 16,605 | 574,470 | 3%</p>
<p>1931-1932 | 18,917 | 537,563 | 3%</p>
<p>1932-1933 | 8,739 | 436,238 | 2%</p>
<p>July 1933 | 3,833 | 62,348 | 6%</p>
<p>August | 1,538 | 46,683 | 3%</p>
<p>September | 700 | 49,470 | 1%</p>
<p>October | 848 | 48,346 | 2%</p>
<p>November | 512 | 32,319 | 1%</p>
<p>December | 254 | 32,623 | 0.8%</p>
<p>January 1934 | 306 | 27,926 | 1%</p>
<p>February | 153 | 29,808 | 0.5%</p>
<p>March | 252 | 32,308 | 0.8%</p>
<p>April | 152 | 35,647 | 0.4%</p>
<p>May | 192 | 38,717 | 0.5%</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the output of Italy and the amount of its exports to the United States have made considerable progress compared with Italy itself, but from the perspective of the American raw silk market, Italian silk only occupies a very small position of less than 3%. How can it attract the attention of the American silk industry and be promoted? In my opinion, the greatest driving force behind this matter lies in Italy's international publicity. At the same time, Italian merchants such as Ganli, who control the full power of world and American raw silk trade, have played a major role in promoting it, resulting in this result. Chinese merchants are only benefiting from it.</p>
<p>Although the New York Commodity Exchange in the United States has been promoted by Italy's international publicity and Italian merchants such as Ganli, it has also always felt that Japanese silk monopolizes the American market and manipulates market prices. Therefore, it has advocated Chinese and Italian raw silk in order to contain and break the monopoly and seek market stability. The following is a list of the amount of raw silk consumed by the United States from various countries, as surveyed by the American Silk Association, for reference:</p>
<p>Table of Raw Silk Consumption in the United States from Various Countries (Unit: picul), Survey by the American Silk Association</p>
<p>Total | Chinese Silk | European Silk | Japanese Silk | American Raw Silk</p>
<p>Year | Quantity Percentage | Quantity Percentage | Quantity Percentage | Consumption Amount</p>
<p>1929 | 66,372 10 | 12,767 2 | 540,608 87 | 619,747</p>
<p>1930 | 89,788 15 | 17,008 3 | 475,430 81 | 582,226</p>
<p>1931 | 66,165 11 | 22,964 3 | 505,760 85 | 594,889</p>
<p>1932 | 22,047 4 | 12,977 2 | 518,794 93 | 553,813</p>
<p>1933 | 26,200 6 | 16,969 3 | 426,358 90 | 469,427</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the United States consumes about 500,000 piculs of raw silk every year. Among them, more than 85% is Japanese silk, European silk accounts for only less than 3%, and Chinese silk accounts for less than 12%. It is self-evident that the American raw silk market is monopolized by Japan and the market price is manipulated by it. Therefore, the United States often promotes Chinese and Italian raw silk in order to subdue Japanese silk and seek market stability, so as to avoid being oppressed by Japan; at the same time, American importers who operate Chinese and Italian raw silk also help from the side in order to obtain considerable benefits. When the Japanese silk industry authorities received the news that the raw silk department of the New York Commodity Exchange in the United States planned to list Chinese and Italian silk and allow it to be used as a substitute for Japanese silk delivery, they believed that it would have a great impact on Japanese silk exports to the United States. Therefore, the Central Silk Association Council held a meeting in June to discuss this matter. The result was: it was considered that the sale of Japanese raw silk with Italian silk and Chinese silk as substitutes for delivery would make the transaction complicated and there was a risk of lack of proper delivery. This was telegraphed to the New York Commodity Exchange, requesting it to consider carefully. At the same time, Japanese raw silk exporters also publicized to the United States that Chinese and Italian raw silk only supply the United States with 40,000-50,000 bales per year, and their quality is mixed. If they are listed, it will only lead to speculative results of buying and selling short, and the price of silk will fluctuate meaninglessly. Not only will the Japanese silk industry be affected, but also American consumers will feel disadvantaged. Therefore, the New York Commodity Exchange will decide on the case of Chinese and Italian silk being used as substitutes for delivery after discussing it at the raw silk member discussion meeting held on September 6 this year.</p>
<p>Even if the New York Commodity Exchange allows Chinese silk to be listed and allowed to be used as a substitute for delivery, whether our Chinese silk can immediately increase its exports to the United States is still uncertain. However, when Italy is promoting and facilitating the preparations for the United States, Japan is obstructing with various arguments. Although this is inevitable in international commercial competition, we must do our best to deal with the aftermath. Now, based on what I have seen, I will write briefly on the left for the exploration of those who care about the silk industry:</p>
<p>First, cooperate with Italy to promote. Feeling the promotion of the Italians in the past, the Chinese people should work together to cooperate in order to realize the listing and delivery of Chinese and Italian silk in the United States; second, publicize to the United States. Before the raw silk department member discussion meeting of the New York Commodity Exchange on September 6, people in our country's silk industry should make various written and on-site publicity in the United States regarding the listing and delivery of Chinese silk as a substitute, so as to avoid being slandered; third, manage Chinese silk exports to the United States and organize sound institutions. In the past, Chinese silk exports to the United States not only lacked management and control, but also the Chinese merchants who directly operated exports were only the individual sales of Shanghai Tongyun and Wuxi Yongtai Silk Factory. The rest was mostly handled by foreign merchants, resulting in various malpractices. This time, the Japanese side has criticized the mixed quality of Chinese silk and that it cannot be used as a substitute for delivery, and that the number is very small. If it is listed, it will only lead to speculation of buying and selling short, resulting in high and low silk prices. We should ask people in the silk industry to carefully consider, study, and implement ways to improve it. The fundamental methods, I have repeatedly written articles to describe, such as improving the unified quality of Chinese silk, reducing the cost of Chinese silk, and stabilizing the market price of Chinese silk. However, the current situation of the silk industry is still difficult to achieve this. The only way is to implement management and control over Chinese silk exports to the United States, and organize a sound institution for exports to the United States through cooperation between officials and merchants. The methods and principles are tentatively proposed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Before Chinese silk is exported to the United States, whether it is handled by Chinese or foreign merchants, it must be strictly inspected by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau according to the standards required by American sock factories and silk factories, and only those that pass the inspection are allowed to be exported:</p>
<p>B. It is best that all raw silk prepared for export to the United States be handled by the institution in order to ensure that the quality of the silk sold meets the needs of the United States. At the same time, we must strive to stabilize the market price of Chinese silk in the American market, and do not show high and low prices from time to time, which will cause a bad impression on the Americans;</p>
<p>C. The quality of the silk handled by the institution, whether it is sold on consignment or purchased and resold, must be above standard D, and can be used as a substitute for Japanese silk delivery, and the purchase price cannot be too high in order to compete with Japanese silk sales.</p>
<p>The above views, I dare not say are appropriate, but with opportunities ahead, please silk industry operators rise up and catch up, and make a common effort.</p>

<p>Call Loan Rates Remain Unchanged, Price Quotations Suspended</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market atmosphere was exceptionally quiet due to it being Sunday and banks being closed as usual. Although some banks, in view of the evolution of the times, have reformed their old habits and conducted business as usual on Sundays, the majority were on holiday, so settlement and delivery had to be suspended as usual. The market rate for foreign call loans remained at seven percent, the same in the morning and afternoon. Call loan transactions in the morning market, including transfers and new trades, totaled over 3.4 million, while afternoon transactions amounted to over 500,000. Transactions in the Small General Association totaled over 300,000. Money shops and foreign public bills had settlements and deliveries totaling over 38 million. Outward remittances from various routes amounted to over 200,000. Transactions involving foreign collateral loans and redemptions totaled over 400,000, with no new activity. The market conditions for subsidiary coinage remained stable. Jiangnan and Jiangyang coins were both quoted at 834.6 yuan per hundred in the morning and afternoon markets, a slight decrease of 0.4 yuan compared to the previous day. Transaction volume was 2,000 hundred coins in each of the morning and afternoon markets.

<p>Only 96 Bonds Up 30 Cents</p>
<p>The past week, August 6th to 11th, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market was extremely stable, remaining in a consolidating state, a rare occurrence in the past two months. Previous market prices had been creeping upwards, with the highest prices approaching 80 percent. General expectations had been met, and under normal circumstances, further increases were unlikely. Consequently, large bullish traders were largely exiting their positions, with selling from northern syndicates being particularly strong. The heavy selling on the 4th of the previous week led to further selling from northern syndicates last week. Therefore, even though the 4th no longer sold, the market situation did not improve. This was due to the supply and demand of funds, but the bond market environment should not be underestimated. Huang Fu's return to politics and expected trip north suggest considerable progress on the North China issue. The inflexibility of the Bank Savings Law means that the bonds deposited with the Central Bank in the future will exceed 200 million yuan and cannot be moved. They cannot be sold at highs and bought at lows as freely as before. Other factors, such as banknote reserves, are not included in this figure. Once implemented, the market will inevitably face a shortage of funds. Therefore, if the future situation does not change much, the bond market still has potential for development. The past week was entirely a consolidation, with fluctuating prices in each of the two daily sessions. Slight increases were met with selling pressure, and slight declines were met with buying support. Although there was upward momentum, it was repeatedly suppressed, leading to a decline in market sentiment. The daily fluctuations were only two or three dimes. The most aggressive sellers were from northern syndicates, with significant selling of 76 bonds. The week's market performance resulted in declines of one or two dimes to seven or eight dimes for most bonds, with only 96 bonds up 30 cents. The total transaction volume was 49,751,000 yuan. A comparative table of price changes is provided below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e227">New York Industrial Stocks See Gains <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Silver Plan Has Slightly Expansionary Nature</p>
<p>Xinfeng Yanghang reported yesterday (11th) that there were two main events in the New York market: one was the raid on the US dollar by short sellers, and the other was the sharp fall in US government bonds. The reason for both was the public's feeling of danger of inflation. Calculated at 35 yuan per ounce of gold, the US-French exchange rate, the US dollar fell by 1%, so it has exceeded the import point. It is now profitable for foreigners to ship gold into the US. Although the US government claims to allow gold to be imported, no one has tried this experiment yet. Except for gold and silver stocks, the stock market saw gains and losses, with very small differences. Railway stocks were relatively weak. Yang City's steel production fell by 17% to 22%, but steel stocks were still stable. The small exchange market was uneven. Foreigners still believe that silver nationalization is the real precursor to inflation. A Treasury official also admitted that the silver plan "has a slightly expansionary nature," so this business has been somewhat confirmed. US government bonds initially fell by more than two yuan, but rebounded before the close, probably as a result of government maintenance. Domestic bonds also fell, while foreign bonds were flat. Grain prices initially fell sharply by five points (the maximum limit) due to rainfall in drought areas and the government's harvest report not being as bad as generally imagined. Later, it was rumored that rainfall might be insufficient, and buyers became brave, pushing prices back up. In the last minute, many profit-takers emerged, and it was rumored that heavy rain was pouring down everywhere and the temperature was dropping sharply. In addition, limit orders that had not been sold were automatically liquidated, and the market fell again by five points. It is rumored that the crop loss is not as large as generally estimated. At the same time, Agriculture Secretary Wallace announced that crop restrictions for next year would be revised, and public panic reached its peak. The exchange suddenly became a madhouse. Until the final gong closed, there were still large-scale sell orders that could not be executed. The New York Stock Exchange announced after the close of trading today that the short positions at the end of July were slightly higher than at the same time last year. Half-day trading volume was 310,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was weak due to the lack of major buyers. Later, it fell due to the sale of spot goods and the profit-taking of bulls. As a result, both spot and futures prices fell by 18 to 20 points. The Liverpool market was dull, with the US cotton standard falling by three points. At the same time, the Bombay cotton market fell by four rupees, three rupees and 25, and three rupees due to profit-taking. The original telegram is recorded below:</p>

<p>Late rice slips back by two-tenths of a yuan</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various suppliers were particularly scarce, with only about eleven or twelve arriving, totaling approximately two thousand shi of grain. The market situation was initially tight, then weakened. At the beginning of the market, there was some outlet, coupled with the scarcity of arrivals, which boosted confidence and created a tight situation. Later, few merchants came to inquire, and as goods became scarce, the market showed signs of softening. Except for Changbang Japonica rice, which remained strong due to scarcity, and various thick Japonica rices, which were relatively stable, the prices of other late rice varieties such as Qing Si began to soften by about two-tenths of a yuan as buyers stopped purchasing. Duyang pointed rice also showed signs of fatigue, with "yin bian yuan" facing sluggish sales and falling slightly by two to three tenths of a yuan. New Pudong Japonica rice remained at its original price.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no matter how qualified a driver in the world is, it's probably impossible for him to drive without any jolting! At least, the driver who's driving this imperial train for us here doesn't have that skill!</p>
<p>The order to start the train was given, and the train officially began to move. At this time, we were all standing upright in that small court. The Empress Dowager was sitting high on her throne, her face full of smiles, ready to fully enjoy her first train ride. Unexpectedly, the entire train suddenly lurched backward, then suddenly lurched forward, shaking us so hard that we almost fell over. At the same time, many of the Empress Dowager's favorite antiques and jade ornaments, which were placed on small wooden shelves on the wall, fell down because they couldn't withstand the jolt. This really scared me out of my wits! A coolie-like driver dared to shake the Empress Dowager's beloved possessions to the ground. Wouldn't he be severely punished? I think the Empress Dowager probably had such thoughts in her mind at that time. Regardless of whether she actually had those thoughts, we couldn't worry about the driver anymore. We had to take care of ourselves! Because the arrangement of this train was almost entirely handled by me and Qing Shan. The idea of installing these small wooden shelves on the east wall to hold the Empress Dowager's antiques and jade ornaments was also decided by us. Now, before we've even left Beijing, these things have all fallen down with the train's first movement. Who can say there won't be more tricks later as the train moves forward? I think someone among these people will definitely have to sacrifice his head! Of course, I myself can't be sure that the person who gets the knife won't be me. Maybe it will be me! Who can guarantee it? Especially since I had boasted to the Empress Dowager about how thoughtful the arrangements on the train were and how well everything was arranged before I escorted her out of the palace and into the sedan chair. Who knew that less than two hours later, I would get such a contradictory rebuttal. Readers, think about it: What good impression could the Empress Dowager still have of me? (103)</p>

<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, when I arrived in Shanghai, I saw something at a friend's house that could evoke feelings and express the sigh of the changing times. Thirty years ago, when this friend was still a child, he was a young master, living in luxury. He sat in his study and read for no more than one or two hours, considering his studies complete. He then went with his father in a carriage to eat elaborate meals. Later, he suffered a major misfortune, but even at a young age, he was able to inherit the family business and carefully preserve all the assets, so people called him a young and mature, filial son. But now? Not to mention that his family fortune has declined, his situation is far from what it used to be. However, while I was at this friend's house, before we had met, he called out from upstairs, "Newcomer, you! Pour a cup of tea and ask the guest to sit down." Who would have thought that the person who brought the tea was an old woman with white hair and a tottering gait? Moreover, she recognized me and was able to call me Mr. ×, which surprised me a little. At first, I thought that Shanghai families always called their maids "Nanny," or "Zhang's," "Wang's." Even if they called someone "Newcomer," it wouldn't be someone so old who had lived there for decades. "Oh!" she said to me secretly, "Mr. ×, you know, Young Master × lost tens of thousands in the stock exchange that spring, and then lost tens of thousands in the gold business that winter. Finally, he also got into a lawsuit over real estate disputes. Mr. ×, the old master never would have imagined this back then!" After saying that, tears rolled down her eyes like beads. After hearing these words, I couldn't help but feel a sudden pang of sadness in my heart. I asked her, "How old are you this year?" She said, "I'm already seventy-three years old. I came here when I was only in my thirties, when Young Master × was still in his mother's belly. Now Young Master ×'s son is already twenty years old, married, and has children." I asked her, "You're not really a newcomer; you're an old-comer." She pursed her lips, smiled, and went inside.</p>
<p>After resting for a while, my friend came down from upstairs. Because I had heard the old woman's words, when I met him, my feelings were different from before. I found it difficult to find the right words to say, given the current environment and the conversation. In the end, I exchanged some polite greetings and said, "I just came by on the way today. I'll come to your residence another day for a more detailed chat." After leaving, I thought that the old woman's words were like a white-haired palace maid talking about ancient history. This is her biography.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Trivial Talks on Surveying <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>How many square miles does China's territory actually cover? If this question is resolved based on the ancient records passed down from our ancestors, it's just a rough estimate, like the Chinese population always being "four hundred million," and it lacks accuracy. People in our country are always worried about the shrinking of our territory, but how much territory do we actually have? Even geography experts probably can't give a precise answer. It's really shameful to say!</p>
<p>As a rule, China's surveying engineering is only used for road construction and river dredging. Surveying the national borders is too troublesome and impractical! Therefore, if other countries don't encroach on China's land, we won't even think about surveying the national borders! Therefore, this article's "trivial talks" are limited to surveying road lines.</p>
<p>The initial step in building a road is surveying. After the road line is determined, the work of purchasing land from the people begins, and only then can construction start. There are many jokes that play out during this process.</p>
<p>When villagers see a group of people carrying "telescopes" and "tape measures" "looking around" and "measuring back and forth" on their fields, they subconsciously know what's going on. Regardless of whether this group of people is practicing surveying or actually planning to build a road, they always shout in a panic-stricken tone, "They're coming to build a road!" It's like everyone is scaring each other about a ghost!</p>
<p>The things used to mark the road line are wooden stakes driven into the ground. For the sake of preventing their fields from being "encircled and bought," the strong ones destroy these wooden stakes at night, while the kind ones secretly move the stakes to another place, with a meaning of "pushing the dead corpse across the border." Therefore, there are many limitations on the surveying project.</p>
<p>We often see news in the newspapers about villagers beating surveyors and burning surveying instruments, but before "beating" and "burning," they also unleash many fierce dogs to scare away the surveyors. It's really stubborn and ridiculous!</p>
<p>This only refers to the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, where the folk customs are relatively good. In the areas of Anhui and Shaanxi, where there are many bandits, it is said that when the Longhai Railway began surveying, there were several times more armed guards with live ammunition than surveying personnel. In China, trying to do some "development" work faces unexpected difficulties. The closed-mindedness of the people is truly regrettable!</p>

<p>— Zhang Yuqing</p>
<p>Women in Hedonistic Professions.</p>
<p>Does it raise the professional status of women? Even movie stars who crave being on camera are jumping out of the film industry to become dancers. Is this due to the economic downturn or personal decadence? Perhaps it's an unanswerable mystery?</p>
<p>Being a dancer is so much fun! It's both enjoyable and profitable, everyone says. Not necessarily! Nothing is ever that simple, is it? But no one sympathizes with their hardships!</p>
<p>Indeed, successful dancers are flourishing and making money everywhere, but their painful underside far outweighs the dance tickets in their purses!</p>
<p>Even when they want to cry, they have to force a smile and act coquettish to please the guests. The thin silk cheongsam is as drenched as if they just came out of a swimming pool. They keep applying cosmetics containing lead, layer after layer. It's late at night! Their legs are weak and powerless! To satisfy the guests, they can only smoke and drink, using nicotine and alcohol to combat the failing spirit. But the guests? They keep going like a clockwork toy, without stopping, maybe even more energetic than before. After all, they came to enjoy themselves! Of course! There are still more painful cries hidden!</p>
<h3 id="e235">Shanghai Embroidery <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Shanghai News Agency</p>
<p>Nowadays, the embroidery businesses in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas all write "Gu Embroidery" on their signboards.</p>
<p>Yes, the exquisite quality of Gu Embroidery is worthy of being the best in the country. At the Nanyang Industrial Exposition in the Qing Dynasty, a portrait of the Italian Empress Dowager, hand-made by Ms. Yu Shenshou of Suzhou, was worth 3,000 pounds. Even now, it is still told as a beautiful story.</p>
<p>But, embroidery is fine, but why insist on calling it Gu Embroidery?</p>
<p>It turns out that there's a story worth mentioning.</p>
<p>During the Ming Dynasty, there was a wealthy gentleman in Shanghai named Gu Huihai, who built a Luxiang Garden on nine acres of land northwest of the county seat. His concubines and maids were particularly skilled in embroidery. Landscapes, figures, plumage, flowers, and plants were all lifelike. The works were very valuable.</p>
<p>There was a "Picture of Eight骏," which, it is said, was praised by viewers as "even Zi Ang's brush couldn't match." There was also a "Picture of Venerable One" (i.e., a Buddhist image), for which someone wrote a poem of praise, saying: "The maiden embroiders Buddha, delighting humans and gods, moving the needle like a brush, the silk like paper. The woman of Huating Gu is praised for her divine skill, twirling silk and splitting thread with slender fingers," and so on.</p>
<p>There is a small story behind the "Stopped Needle Picture."</p>
<p>It is said that one day, many distinguished guests gathered in Luxiang Garden. During the conversation, Gu Embroidery was mentioned, and they all praised it highly. Only an old Confucian scholar named Jin disagreed, saying:</p>
<p>"Although embroidery is good, it is unnecessary. In the past, Qian Wentong liked to wear new clothes and wore official attire made of bright red cloud-patterned cloth to court. As a result, the court learned that Songjiang produced cloth, and ordered that it be sent to Beijing as tribute every year, which has harmed the local area to this day. Why doesn't your family engage in weaving, so that visitors to your door only hear the clatter of looms? Wouldn't that be more meaningful than your family's women embroidering day and night, with that expression of stopped needle and silence?"</p>
<p>At that time, Gu Huihai listened and smiled askew at others, saying:</p>
<p>"Don't say this gentleman is an old scholar! Although his wording is straightforward, it is quite charming!"</p>
<p>The next day, he ordered someone to embroider the "Stopped Needle Picture." After it was completed, the painting was extremely beautiful, and there were no traces of the seams. People from all over Shanghai came to see it. This painting was valued at three hundred taels of gold. Later, a wealthy merchant from Yangzhou brought a Han jade chain and a picture of a beauty by Zhou Fang to the Gu family, requesting an exchange, and took it away.</p>
<p>At that time, the name of Gu Embroidery was almost "a household name" throughout the country. Later, embroidery works in boudoirs were initially pretended to be from the Gu family, and then called imitations. Although it has now been lost, the name Gu Embroidery has become a very typical and popular name in the embroidery industry.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3 id="e236">Two Small Problems <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Wei</p>
<p>The Bare Leg Problem: These past few days, women's bare legs have sparked debate in both male and female circles due to the strict prohibition by Yuan Liang, the mayor of Beiping. In Suzhou, the issue of women's bare legs is also extremely lively. It started with the request for prohibition by party member Zhou Songlun, followed by Ms. Pan Ying's letter to the Wu County Magistrate, shouting injustice, and ended with Director Wang of the Public Security Bureau instructing all patrol officers to persuade any women found with bare legs, and if they refused, they could be detained and punished. During this time of successive submissions and issued instructions, the Suzhou newspapers were, of course, also adorned with much excitement. Newspaper supplements published special issues, and major and minor newspapers each had wonderful articles, with public reason and private reason. Frankly speaking, the shapely, fleshy, and shiny bare legs of modern women, viewed with an artistic eye, are indeed pleasing to the eye and touch the emotions, which is very in line with the condition of "women dress for those who appreciate them." As for the talk of coolness and economy, it is simply deception. Modern young ladies wear tight cheongsams on their bodies, plus silk shawls or thin coats to ward off the cold, barely exposing their legs. How much coolness can they get? Economy is even less to speak of. Their toenails are painted with red rouge, and their thighs are smeared with fragrant cream. One makeover costs a lot. Just look at the import price of cosmetics for six months, which reaches over 852,000 yuan. Where is there any economy to speak of! After the ban on bare legs in Suzhou was announced, there were indeed fewer bare legs, but a group of stubborn girls still exposed their shapely legs in the park, where we still had the opportunity to appreciate them. Fortunately, although the ban was strict, the police turned a blind eye and allowed those girls their freedom!</p>
<p>The Festival Problem: Because of the prayer for rain, the small white dragon parade and dragon lantern play held by the villagers led to a welcoming festival with gongs and drums, pairs of yamen runners, fish and dragons in procession, and a complete set of ceremonial attire. This kind of festival was initially regarded by the authorities as "although their foolishness is unattainable, their sincerity is truly commendable," and they adopted a laissez-faire approach. As a result, a group of benevolent men and women who were willing to sacrifice for the Buddha's sake immediately mobilized en masse, with those who had money contributing money and those who had strength contributing strength, rushing around in the scorching sun. In Suzhou last month, it was simply a world of gods. There were at least two festivals every day, and the number of gong-carrying and incense-carrying people in the procession increased sharply from a dozen or so to two or three hundred. Moreover, the objects hanging on them changed daily, even hanging watermelons on their breasts and wearing velvet balls on their upper bodies. The strange shapes became more and more bizarre. As a result, the party headquarters issued a warning, and the county government issued an instruction. However, those who banned banned, and those who participated participated. It was not until the county magistrate personally instructed the Public Security Bureau and dismissed patrol officers and leaders of the festival that the enthusiasm for the festival came to a halt. However, the people of Suzhou are still discussing the authorities' attitude towards the festival, which was lenient at first and strict later, as a topic of conversation after tea and dinner.</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Summer Children's Health Camp was piloted for the first year at Tongji Middle School in Wusong. The entire camp had 59 people. The results of the physical examination were:</p>
<p>Dental disease: 46 people</p>
<p>Trachoma: 33 people</p>
<p>Malnutrition: 31 people</p>
<p>Tonsil disease: 29 people</p>
<p>Glandular disease: 13 people</p>
<p>Anemia: 2 people</p>
<p>Heart disease: 2 people</p>
<p>Ear disease: 2 people</p>
<p>Skin disease: 1 person</p>
<p>Ascariasis: 11 people</p>
<p>Liver fluke disease: 1 person</p>
<p>We know that children are the future citizens, and their health is related to the entire nation. Now, just among 59 people, so many diseases have already been found, which shows how weak the children in our country are. We are now constantly raising this issue, hoping that everyone will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Outline of Medical Construction (Part 1) <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Over the years, the call for medical improvement has been loud. But do those who seek improvement have concrete methods? If we want the advancement of medicine, then everything that can help the development of medicine should be promoted and vigorously implemented, and everything that can hinder the development of medicine should be overthrown and eliminated. Today, our country's medicine is like a newly born seedling. It is not enough to nourish it with timely rain and fertilize it with manure to help it grow. It is not enough to remove its pests and cut down its weeds to fully develop it. Therefore, without considering my shallow knowledge, I have prepared an outline, which I call the Outline of Medical Construction.</p>
<p>(1) Medical Education: Those who dredge a stream must first treat the source. Those who plant a tree must first strengthen the base. Those who govern the world must first devote themselves to education. Why is medical construction any different? Therefore, I will first talk about medical education.</p>
<p>(A) Formulating Standards for Medical Curriculum and Improving Poor Medical Schools: Although there are 26 medical schools in the country, very few of their curricula can truly be called reasonable. The completeness or simplicity of the curriculum and equipment varies greatly. Therefore, the level of graduates also varies greatly. This is because of the uneven education they received, so they cannot achieve consistent results. Those who shoot must have a target before they know where to aim. Those who walk must have a direction before they know where to go. There has never been a case of effective governance and public compliance without a purpose or standard. Therefore, the formulation of standards for the medical curriculum is an urgent task. Now the government has an organization for the Medical Curriculum Standards Committee, and specific medical school curriculum standards are being drafted. This is what we are looking forward to and hoping will be implemented soon.</p>
<p>(B) Emphasizing Both Theory and Experience, Increasing Internship Time: The formulation of the medical education curriculum is as mentioned above. But what standards should be used? I say, equal emphasis on clinical medicine and basic medicine. Medicine is a practical science. It must have experimentation and practice. In domestic schools, there is generally more time spent reading in the classroom and less time spent practicing in the hospital. After graduation, students often have deep theoretical knowledge but insufficient experience when they start their practice. Even worse, they even use patients as experiments. This is a very dangerous thing. Now, if we increase the time spent practicing to three years or more, so that they already have rich experience during their student years, then they can handle things with ease when they start their practice, and there will be no cases of using patients as experiments.</p>
<p>(C) Adding a Course in Medical Ethics to Train Good Doctors: It is said that "if you are not a good minister, then be a good doctor." To call a doctor good is not only because of their superior knowledge, but also because of their noble character. This is why domestic medical schools must add a course in medical ethics. A doctor is a profession, and they have a special position with respect to the country, society, patients, and colleagues. The ethics they should follow cannot be fully covered by ordinary ethics. If they do not cultivate a good character during their studies, then it will be difficult to avoid unethical and unjust actions after they start their practice. In recent years, medical disputes have emerged one after another, and there has been much unethical competition among colleagues. This shows that doctors lack adequate self-discipline and proper conduct. If we can add a course in medical ethics to train good doctors, then in a few years, the so-called medical disputes will naturally decrease invisibly.</p>
<p>(D) Increasing the Number of Standard Medical Schools in Each Province to Increase the Production of Formal New Doctors: Recently, those who talk about medical education have the theory of emphasizing quality and emphasizing quantity. Those who emphasize quality advocate raising the level of medical education without necessarily establishing more medical schools. Those who emphasize quantity believe that the number of new doctors in the country is insufficient, and it is necessary to establish more medical schools to produce a large number of new doctors. I believe that the two theories can be used together and should not be abandoned partially. The fact that the number of new doctors in the country is insufficient is indeed true. And the desire to establish more medical schools to produce a large number of new doctors is an urgent task at the moment. However, in this regard, we must not only increase the number of medical schools, but also examine the content of the medical schools, ensuring that the schools added all meet the standards of the medical curriculum. Only then will those produced be formal new doctors. Otherwise, if we only seek quantity and do not ask about quality, and produce crudely and indiscriminately, with quack doctors everywhere, this is what Confucius meant by "What's the use of having many?"</p>
<p>(2) Medical Administration</p>
<p>Medical administration is a branch of government administration. Our country's medical administration has been neglected for a long time. There is no news of anything being done to promote benefits and eliminate harms to protect the development of our medical profession.

<h3 id="e239">One of the Common Summer Skin Diseases: Eczema (Part Two) <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Jilin</p>
<p>The above six stages are what is commonly seen in eczema. However, its progression is not necessarily as complete as described. The progression varies depending on the strength of the cause, the speed of onset, the duration of the irritation, the individual's constitution, and the location of the occurrence. It may be cured during the erythema stage, or it may start as papules from the beginning. Some cases resolve after the vesicles and pustules dry and form scabs. There are also cases that proceed neatly from the first stage to the sixth stage. Now that the progression of eczema is clear, I will further describe its symptoms, broadly divided into two types: acute and chronic. In the initial stage of acute eczema, the skin becomes flushed, swollen, hot, and itchy, often accompanied by mild systemic symptoms such as chills. Children may even develop a fever. The affected area gradually transforms into papules and vesicles, then into pustules, forming crusts. After the crusts fall off, it becomes scaly and heals. However, if the underlying cause and all contributing factors are not addressed, the condition will inevitably recur, eventually becoming chronic eczema. Its stubbornness and difficulty to treat are even greater than in the acute stage, and the itching is also more severe. Excessive scratching often exacerbates the inflammation, leading to ulceration. Therefore, it is advisable to seek appropriate treatment during the acute stage of eczema.</p>
<p>Eczema commonly occurs on the head, face, hands, feet, neck, flexural surfaces of joints, groin, and breasts. The symptoms vary slightly depending on the location. Here is a brief description of a few:</p>
<p>(1) Eczema of the Head and Face: It usually starts with chills, followed by flushing and swelling of the face, and the appearance of small papules, vesicles, or pustules. It gradually spreads to the scalp and becomes chronic. However, it can also start on the scalp and then spread to the face. It is more common in children because their skin is thin and easily irritated by external factors.</p>
<p>(2) Eczema of the Hands and Feet: It may develop on the toes, forming a small number of vesicles, or it may invade the entire hand or foot, causing severe swelling and the formation of numerous vesicles. The itching is exceptionally intense. When it occurs on the lower legs, it is often associated with varicose veins, frequently causing thickening and edema of the skin.</p>
<p>(3) Eczema of the Genitals: It occurs on the scrotum, perineum, and other areas, appearing red and moist, with or without scaling. In severe cases, the entire area may become edematous, or it may spread to the surrounding area of the anus.</p>
<p>(4) Intertriginous Eczema: In obese individuals, it often occurs on the neck, between the thighs, and in areas such as the armpits, under the breasts, and flexural surfaces of joints. The skin is constantly rubbed against itself, and the irritation of sweat further promotes the development of eczema. It can also spread from the neck or breasts to the entire trunk.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The treatment of eczema varies depending on the stage of its progression, the different symptoms, and the unpredictable changes. For example, in the erythema and papule stages, non-irritating dusting powders, alcoholic washes, and drying lotions are suitable. A single method or a combination of several methods may be used, depending on the doctor's experience. For instance, when the itching is unbearable, an alcoholic wash may be used first, followed by a dusting powder on the same area. In the vesicle and pustule stages, dusting powders or calamine lotion should be applied. During the weeping stage, areas not covered by crusts should be treated with wet compresses. For mild cases of weeping, dusting powders may also be used. When both weeping and crusting are severe, ointments should be applied and bandaged. The bandages should be changed frequently when there is a large amount of serous drainage. For facial eczema, where bandaging is inconvenient, adhesive plasters may be used. In the scaling stage, ointments such as white precipitate mercury ointment should be used. In general, although eczema is a common skin disease, the treatment should be based on a clear understanding of the nature of the therapy and the state of the eczema, selecting the appropriate treatment. For chronic and stubborn eczema, systemic therapy, such as injections and oral medications, may be necessary. It is crucial to seek guidance from a doctor before attempting any treatment rashly. For the patient's sake, attention should be paid to:</p>
<p>(1) Health Preservation: Avoid irritating foods and drinks (such as alcohol, vinegar, scallions, and ginger), and ensure regular bowel movements.</p>
<p>(2) Avoid External Irritation: Such as friction or pressure from clothing.</p>
<p>As for the treatment methods, consult a doctor. Otherwise, not only will the opportunity for treatment be missed, but there will also be unnecessary losses in terms of mental well-being, physical strength, and finances.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(35) Appendicitis and Periappendicitis</p>
<p>(Q) What is the appendix?</p>
<p>(A) The appendix is a small, worm-like appendage that extends from the cecum, which is the beginning of the large intestine. It was formerly translated as the vermiform process. That is what it is.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the cecum?</p>
<p>(A) The cecum is the beginning of the large intestine, the sac-like portion that hangs down below where it connects to the small intestine, but it does not connect to the small intestine.</p>
<p>(Q) Are appendicitis and periappendicitis the same disease?</p>
<p>(A) Anatomically, they should be considered two separate diseases because the affected parts are different. However, they often occur simultaneously in clinical practice, and the symptoms are similar, making it difficult to distinguish between them. Therefore, they are usually discussed together.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the causes of this disease?</p>
<p>(A) There are only three possible causes. (1) The unique structure of the appendix, such as a narrow lumen, many folds in the mucosa, nutrient vessels that are end arteries, and an abundance of lymphoid tissue, are all factors that can induce the disease. (2) Constipation, the intrusion of fish bones or worms, or inflammation of the uterine adnexa are also contributing factors. (3) It can also be induced during the course of infectious diseases.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the initial symptoms of appendicitis and periappendicitis?</p>
<p>(A) They begin with acute abdominal pain, nausea (sometimes vomiting), and loss of appetite. There is a coated tongue, and constipation is common.</p>
<p>(Q) Are there any specific differences between this type of abdominal pain and ordinary abdominal pain?</p>
<p>(A) The abdominal pain that occurs during appendicitis is often widespread at first; within 24 hours, it becomes localized to the right lower abdomen. At the same time, there is tenderness in this area.</p>
<p>(Q) What external phenomena are present in the right lower abdomen?</p>
<p>(A) There is reflexive tension in the abdominal wall in the right lower abdomen; movement during breathing is less pronounced than on the left side. The abdominal wall reflexes are often absent.</p>
<p>(Q) Are there any abnormalities in the right leg?</p>
<p>(A) The right leg often assumes a flexed position.</p>
<p>(Q) Does the patient have a fever?</p>
<p>(A) A fever of 38 to 40 degrees Celsius is common; however, some patients do not have a fever.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the condition of the patient's pulse?</p>
<p>(A) Rapid; but in mild cases, it is less than 100 beats per minute. The faster the pulse rate, the more severe the condition.</p>
<p>(Q) How long does the course of this disease usually last?</p>
<p>(A) In mild cases, it can be cured in just a few days. There are also cases that recur later. Some may develop a periappendiceal abscess that ruptures spontaneously. If surgical removal is not performed, it may rupture naturally into the peritoneal cavity, intestines, bladder, etc. The most dangerous complications are septicemia or widespread perforating peritonitis, which are often fatal.</p>
<p>(Q) What should be the treatment principles for appendicitis and periappendicitis?</p>
<p>(A) During the acute phase, the patient should rest absolutely and abstain from food for one to two days. Milk, meat broth, egg yolk, and fruit juice can be given. Once the pain has subsided, a soft diet can be gradually introduced after a week. Sedatives are the main medications used; enemas are used to promote bowel movements. When it transitions to a chronic state, coarse foods should be avoided, bowel movements should be monitored, and warm, moist compresses or ichthammol ointment should be applied to the abdomen. In addition, surgical removal is best performed as early as possible, as the degree of danger increases with delay. In critical situations, surgery must be performed promptly.</p>

<p>(10) Hypertrophy of the Palatine Tonsils</p>
<p>Those who have read the ninth issue of this publication probably already understand what the tonsils are. Therefore, it will be much easier to discuss the pathological changes of the tonsils. The most important pathological changes of the tonsils are their proliferation and inflammation. The palatine tonsils are most susceptible to proliferation and hypertrophy. The pharyngeal tonsils are second. Now, I will first discuss hypertrophy of the palatine tonsils. In the next issue, I will discuss adenoid hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Hypertrophy of the palatine tonsils, originally named Hypertrophiatonsillaepalatiuae, seems to be more common in children in clinical practice. It is especially likely to occur in children with a scrofulous constitution. However, it also occurs in adults in no small numbers. This is because it is often induced by acute tonsillitis. This disease also has a genetic relationship. For example, if a child has this condition, their parents may also have had the same disease, or siblings may have the condition. We doctors often encounter these examples. In mild cases of this condition, there is no significant discomfort. Sometimes there is only an abnormal sensation in the throat. This is due to inflammation of the throat. In severe cases, the palatine tonsils are noticeably enlarged, even touching each other on both sides. The pharyngeal cavity is also narrowed as a result (see figure). Patients also complain of various symptoms, namely: (1) Narrowing of the throat, with an abnormal sensation. (2) Difficulty swallowing and breathing. (3) Inaccurate pronunciation. (4) Nasal snoring during sleep. (5) Reflex symptoms, such as coughing, wheezing, and headache. (6) The tonsillar crypts are mostly deep and wide, often with white or yellowish-white curd-like debris. This debris is medically known as tonsillar plugs (Mandelpfropf). Microscopic examination reveals dried secretions, desquamated epithelium, and various bacteria.</p>
<p>Children or adults with hypertrophy of the palatine tonsils are very susceptible to rhinitis, tonsillitis, otitis media, and tracheobronchitis. It can also be complicated by adenoid hypertrophy and acute or chronic rheumatic arthritis. Therefore, this condition has a great impact on human health. Regarding treatment, medication is ineffective. Surgery is required. However, in mild cases of hypertrophy, the tonsils may atrophy due to physiological regression during puberty. In that case, surgery is not necessary, and it can heal on its own (especially in children). If the hypertrophy is severe and has already caused narrowing of the pharyngeal cavity, difficulty swallowing and breathing, or frequent tonsillitis, then surgery is necessary. There are two surgical methods. One is called tonsillotomy, which is a method of removing part of the palatine tonsils. It is mostly used in children. The other is called tonsillectomy, which is a method of removing the entire palatine tonsils. It is mostly used in adults. However, the local conditions and the overall health must also be considered before deciding which surgical method to use. Fortunately, this decision is the responsibility of a specialist doctor, so you don't need to discuss it in detail.</p>

<h3 id="e242">A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (16) <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 6: Staging of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>It is almost universally known that pulmonary tuberculosis is divided into stages one, two, and three. The general public is probably aware that stage one is curable, stage two is somewhat different, and stage three is almost hopeless. This idea originated entirely from the theory of Turban Gerhardt. His main points are: (1) Stage one. At this stage, the affected area is very small. It is mild and limited to a small portion of a lobe of the lung, specifically at the apex of the lung and not exceeding the clavicle boundary. Fine rales may or may not be present upon auscultation. (2) Stage two. Now, it has spread outward from a small localized area, but in any case, it remains behind stage three. (3) Stage three. At this stage, one or several lobes are in a state of infiltration, and cavities have formed. This division into three stages is entirely based on the extent of the disease and is unrelated to the nature of the lesions in pathological anatomy. Therefore, its academic value is not very high. We must understand that there are no absolute boundaries to the progression and course of any disease; the most regular is true pneumonia. Its external symptoms and internal pathological anatomical changes almost correspond to each other like "a drum and its beat." However, its pattern of disease is not always so exemplary. It is even more difficult for pulmonary tuberculosis, which has the most complex disease course! Its clinical symptoms and course are not at all fixed, and in terms of pathological anatomy, although there are various distinctions between proliferative and exudative caseation and cavitation, the lungs of most patients contain almost all types. Based on this situation, it is almost impossible to divide pulmonary tuberculosis into stages in academic terms. This approach of relying on the area of the disease is, of course, a helpless measure, but it is clear, understandable, and easy to grasp. This classification has already been adopted in the statistical rules for the disease, and as a result, it has become universally known and regarded as a matter of course in the general public.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Each Person's Own Sky (Part Two) <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yiqing</p>
<p>The theater is the only venue where "people of all kinds" can "meet by chance," as the Buddha said, based on affinities. It is also a mysterious place where various communicable disease germs can "get their due" and spread. In other words, when opportunities are not good, the theater can become an infectious disease exchange, and the bulk of the traded goods are droplet-borne infectious diseases — most respiratory infectious diseases fall into this category. Although soldiers and police are hired at the door to provide protection, they can only prevent petty criminals from causing trouble or stop uninvited guests (perhaps distinguished guests who have complimentary tickets but forgot to bring them) from watching the show for free, but they cannot refuse patients and disease carriers from entering and buying tickets — because our country's reports of "statutory infectious diseases" and measures to isolate patients and disease carriers have not yet been implemented, there are particularly many mobile patients and disease carriers who frequent game venues. Since droplet-borne infectious diseases are inevitably mixed in the theater, these people each "blow their own trumpets" and spray droplets. At the same time, because there are many people and little air in the theater, people have to inhale the air exhaled by others for replenishment. Healthy tourists inevitably inhale the droplets of patients or disease carriers one after another. People with weak resistance become ill when they go home. When they are critically ill and on their deathbeds, they do not even know how they got infected, and they secretly lament in their hearts that they are "as hapless as Guan Yu and Zhang Fei." Is this not very sad!</p>
<p>In the theater, in order to obtain mental recreation, we sometimes inevitably contract droplet-borne infectious diseases in this way. Their deadly effects must be carried out "without the slightest deviation" and "settled on time." It is really not worth the loss and is not a good deal. Therefore, when there is a certain droplet-borne infectious disease in the area — such as influenza, whooping cough, pneumonia, measles, plague, as well as cerebrospinal meningitis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, etc. — it is best to temporarily stop going to the theater. If a famous actor, a famous blockbuster, or a famous artist comes along during this time, it would be a pity to miss them. If you have to bite the bullet and go see them, then it is best to act as an "ultra-modern monster" in a dignified manner and wear a face mask to watch the show without being polite. This is almost like "converting a beast into a child, with a chivalrous woman as a neighbor." If there is no way to subdue the "demon," then have a protective "talisman." This can allow hygiene to coexist with entertainment, and entertainment should not forget hygiene! In fact, in the future, if hygiene can be effectively implemented in various places, except when influenza is rampant, even if theaters are closed, it will be impossible to prevent other acute droplet-borne infectious diseases from spreading. At that time, the local health authorities may have to first order theaters to temporarily suspend business in order to prevent and control the diseases. When that happens, even if theatergoers and movie fans want to have a good time, they will not be able to.</p>
<p>As for the theater, if it knows its responsibilities and wants to make people entertain themselves and benefit from it, and not make people want to benefit but suffer losses, it should provide the best comfort facilities at any time for the limited ticket price. Everything from the smooth flow of air, appropriate temperature and humidity, and the suppression of dust, to the promotion of re-entry passes during breaks (theaters should also insert break times), should be strived for to be perfect. At the same time, attention should be paid to banning vendors, waiters, tea, teacups, and tidying up spittoons and toilets, so that everything is clean and can show that it is a high-class entertainment venue. That is the most beautiful merchant ethics; it really has a great impact on business. Bad theaters will be naturally sanctioned by society, even if local authorities do not crack down on them. As long as everyone has been burned once and has the prejudice of "never again," that theater will have no patrons in no time. In the future, when everyone pays attention to hygiene, this sanction will definitely be even fiercer than it is now! Moreover, many of these phenomena are unique to small cities in the mainland. In the countryside, when offering sacrifices to the gods, "grass stage troupes" are invited to perform in open-air sheds, just like open-air movies in the city in summer. The capacity and flow of air are not a problem. To be honest, if the lower-class theaters in the city are unable to improve, they might as well return to simplicity and start performing in the open air.</p>
<p>(Regarding the construction of public assembly halls, various cities in the interior of our country are still lacking. The hygiene points that should be noted during construction and management are the same as those for theaters before.)</p>

<h3 id="e244">Humor and Cynicism <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>The East has a tradition of despotism. Turkey, Persia, and India, as a rule, both govern and are governed. Although this situation persists in the present world, no thinking person can deny the influence of social contract theory in the world.</p>
<p>As a rule, equality is sought, but inequality remains. The situation of inequality is unavoidable. At this time, thought usually has only one way out — cynicism. It is the salvation that the oppressed use to survive.</p>
<p>If one can live, can die, can laugh, can cry, and emotions each have appropriate development, the world is at peace. If one cannot seek to live, cannot seek to die, is not allowed to laugh, and is not allowed to cry, destroying emotions without remainder, then everything is chaotic. Whenever one is not allowed to cry or laugh, a liberation suddenly comes — that is humor, a kindred spirit of cynicism.</p>
<p>People's emotions are often timid in the face of truth and fear reality. They only watch tragic tragedies and only watch comedies that are boring. Therefore, a kind of comedy must come, concealing the truth and muddling through the time, giving people a kind of release. They laugh loudly and disperse. Just seeing that people who are good at telling jokes are welcomed by everyone in society knows this principle.</p>
<p>Humor and cynicism are also different. The latter has meaning, the former has no meaning. The latter belongs to the protagonist of the play, the former belongs to the clown. The two are both hard workers. For example, deliberately making people laugh and making all kinds of strange shapes also requires painstaking management.</p>
<p>Conversely, the governed are cynical, and those who govern are humorous. Under a despotic tyrant, if one wants to offer advice obliquely, one must take a roundabout route. A belly full of jokes and various strange shapes is indispensable. This is no less than the功勞 of other "royal assistants." Only Qu Yuan was too serious, "Will he use the sudden and slippery humor as grease or leather to clean the pillars and level the ground?" He has already included humorists in the oil category. This is enough to show Qu Yuan's cynicism.</p>
<p>But there are some other questions: Does China only have comedies, or does it also have tragicomedies? Is it deliberately pretending to be ugly feet, or is the ugly foot pretending to be a lead actor? Is it somewhere between an ugly foot and a non-ugly foot, or is it playing some ancient drama for people to watch three thousand years ago? …</p>

<p>(9) A Visit to the North and South Pavilions</p>
<p>Stealing leisure in a busy schedule, we made a trip to the North and South Pavilions one early morning.</p>
<p>Leaving Boshan Gate and crossing the bridge, we arrived at the North and South Pavilions, famous for their scenery. First we went to the North Pavilion, formerly Yiyuan, now Yiyuan Elementary School. There is a Thunder God Temple, and the incense is still strong. There is a pavilion facing the goldfish pond. On the wall is engraved the four characters "Kites Flying and Fish Leaping," which have a magnificent air. There are very large goldfish in the pond, but it is a pity that the pond water is not clear and there is not much elegance.</p>
<p>Leaving the North Pavilion, we crossed the street to the South Pavilion. It is now the site of the Construction Bureau and is said to be the place where Fan Zhongyan lived. There is a spring inside, the pond is about one square zhang, and the locals named it Fan Spring because of this. A temple was built and called Fan Gong Temple.</p>
<p>However, we have been to Changshan, and it is true that Fan Zhongyan grew up in Changshan; moreover, Boshan was not a large county in the past, so why would Fan Gong come here? The local legends are really a bit unreliable.</p>
<p>The Fan Spring leaves the South Pavilion and divides into three streams flowing outward, south to Qianyuan and north to Yiyuan; the other stream flows west along the stone bridge into the city. This stream of spring water is very interesting. This is really a unique spectacle of Boshan!</p>
<h3 id="e246">On the Future of Graduates and the "Quota System" for Admissions <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Mo</p>
<p>The plight of intellectuals as commodities is a universally lamented issue, both ancient and modern. From the Master Confucius, who "waited for a good price to sell himself," to graduates who use diplomas as trademarks, all prove that the value of intellectuals is not much higher than that of slaves in ancient Eastern markets. With the commodification of labor, knowledge itself has gained exchange value, and intellectuals have become owners of a special commodity. However, due to the lack of progress in Chinese society, intellectuals are not yet able to speak of free contracts; even those who study "science" cannot avoid selling themselves.</p>
<p>The difference between the use value of intellectuals and the use value of manual laborers is like the difference between hunting dogs and oxen in the eyes of their master. However, this commodity of all living beings is, after all, somewhat different from other commodities. When wheat or coffee cannot be sold, they can only be stored in warehouses to rot. But scholars who cannot find enlightened masters to serve will lament, feel isolated and indignant, or even take risks. Although a failed scholar's rebellion takes three years to materialize, if the sighing farmers on the loess plateau are incited, the world will become troubled from then on. This is why the examination system, which resembles a commodity exposition and a commodity inspection bureau, is so valuable!</p>
<p>In today's economic panic, it is not only general commodities that are overproduced, but also this special commodity – the commodity of knowledge – is inevitably overproduced as well. On the one hand, there is "social dumping." On the other hand, this commodity, lacking an outlet for absorption, collapses and overflows, and political extremism emerges. The situation in China is even more tragic. Every year, special factories – schools – produce them in batches with crude and shoddy workmanship and push them onto the market. However, supply exceeds demand, and sales are sluggish. As long as this phenomenon exists, society will not be stable. Therefore, this matter must be given attention.</p>
<p>As the summer vacation approaches each year, newspapers often feature articles about sending off graduates or discussing the future of students. This year is even more lively, and among them, the most noteworthy is Dr. Hu Shih's article "A Gift to This Year's University Graduates" (Wen, 24, Ta Kung Pao). In addition to three old self-defense prescriptions, he added a new one: "You must first reflect on yourself; do not blame others exclusively, and even less blame society." According to his high opinion, the reason why graduates cannot find a bowl of rice to eat is not because society does not need them, but because their own studies are not good, or they mistakenly entered a bogus school. What beautiful and sarcastic words! This is as if the commodities of a monopoly or large factory are saying to the commodities of small factories: "Do not complain about buyers or envy others; first, blame yourselves, who called your goods inferior and the brand of the factory you came from not old enough?" All unsold commodities, remember the lesson of the commodities from the famous and old brand Made in U.S.A.!</p>
<p>Recently, university graduates in Beiping have even formed an organization called the "Professional Sports League." Although there are no words like "civil rights" or "anti-imperialism," the terms "sports" and "league" are always jarring and could easily cause trouble. For the sake of stabilizing the political market, we should think of a control method.</p>
<p>We know that the most common way to alleviate overproduction is to limit production and stipulate the amount of commodity consumption – which is called the "quota system" in Japan and the "Quota System" in Europe and the United States. This method has been applied to the production of special commodity students in Hitler's Germany. As soon as Hitler came to power, he promulgated a law "Suppressing Overcrowding in German Schools" and adopted an admissions "quota system." But at that time, only Jewish students were restricted. By the end of last year, Germany had a new law restricting the number of university students in general. According to this law, the number of high school graduates who passed the university entrance exam and entered university in 1934 was limited to 15,000. But according to the government's estimate, there should be 27,600 male and 10,400 female students graduating from high school that year who could enter university. That is to say, three-fifths of the students who could have entered university were deprived of this right. This is not surprising. Before Hitler's dictatorship was established, the stagnation of the commodity of knowledge in Germany was already considerable: among 8,000 engineering graduates, only 1,000 found jobs; among 22,000 probationary teachers, only 3,900 obtained assistant teacher positions; and 72% of artists in Berlin had a monthly income of less than 50 marks. Under these circumstances, the increase in university students would naturally only spread more seeds for liberalism and extremism. Therefore, Hitler's restriction of the production of this special commodity is indeed a fundamental solution. It is unknown what China's control will be like in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e247">The Seizure of Occupations <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Cha Shiji</p>
<p>Recently, I read two articles in this publication on the issue of youth employment. One is by Mr. You Mo, and the other is by Mr. Bai Ge. The two men's opinions are completely opposite; Mr. You said that whether young people can find employment is definitely not because society does not have jobs to provide for them, but because there are no good jobs that young people idealize for them; Mr. Bai, on the other hand, believes that it is an overall social problem, meaning that there are simply not that many positions in society to supply new graduates.</p>
<p>Of the two views, I am naturally in agreement with Mr. Bai Ge. The reason is very simple, as Mr. Bai Ge said, "...even if young students in general follow the path pointed out by Mr. You, the result will only be to squeeze out another part of the employed people who have less opportunity to receive education and have not obtained a higher position, turning them into unemployed people, and exchanging their positions with each other."</p>
<p>The fundamental remedy for unemployment naturally lies in increasing the number of jobs, definitely not in exchanging them with each other. However, in this time of recession that pervades the world, what new development is possible? It is like a cup of water; when there are few thirsty people, everyone can be casual, but once there are many thirsty people and the amount is insufficient, a scramble will occur. The so-called scramble is just to "exchange" the owner of the job, that is, one of the unemployed gets a job, which means that an unemployed person is produced among the employed.</p>
<p>Silently observing the trend of current society, the job-grabbing movement is becoming increasingly blatant. Logically, the more competitors there are for jobs, the most talented should be employed, and the old and incompetent must be eliminated. The employer must feel the convenience of choice. But in reality, it is the exact opposite. When society is shrouded in profound panic, the struggle for survival is fierce, and the criteria for employing people will become more severe and narrow. The so-called severe is not the so-called assessment of talent, but "vested interests." In Chinese society, where feudal ideas are still deeply rooted, it will undoubtedly become pure kinship or localism. Those who do not have reliable fellow villagers and relatives will have greater difficulty finding employment than in more prosperous times.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the perspective of those in employment, because of the large number of competitors, they must be cautious and work to preserve their current position. Like the customs and post office, where the number of people is relatively large, they have already formed very strong groups because of the examination relationship. Today, even those with fewer people have a considerable combination to deal with others' job grabbing. Therefore, the more depressed the times are, the more developed this kind of exclusive organization will be. Economically speaking, it seems to be a return from a free exchange economy to an ancient closed economy. In short, those who have already obtained employment are determined not to lose their position casually, so new graduates and young people will feel it more and more difficult to find a job.</p>
<p>From the above two reasons, we can know that even if the exchange of occupations (such as university students doing the work of middle school graduates, and middle school graduates doing the work of primary school graduates) can muddle through for a while, when the degree of panic is truly deepened, it will also be impossible even to exchange because employers are bound by vested interests and the employed are united in resistance.</p>

<p>— Li Jinming</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui said in the "Free Talk" on August 1st: "Literature will not die, and the great disaster will not stop." These words are quite alarming.</p>
<p>Opening up the history of the East and West, from ancient times to the present, it seems that there has never been a literary writer who held a pen in one hand and a knife in the other. There has never been anyone who said that he used literature as a political program, sharpened his weapons and troops, attacked cities and expanded territories, and opposed the imperial dynasty. The Book of Songs was only the mournful voice of small people who were so weak that they did not even dare to speak. The composition of the Songs of Chu was only due to Qu Yuan's integrity and poverty and his inability to scheme and exploit. If it is said that he was actually jilted by a woman and deliberately made an issue of it, it is not impossible. As for the rebellious figures who were stimulated by the Book of Songs and the Songs of Chu later, there were absolutely none. To give a simple example: why did the author of the Water Margin not write Song Jiang and Wu Yong as ambitious men who "buried their heads in books" and "slapped the table and threw away their pens"? If it is said that the scattered poems such as "The old man with a broken arm from Xinfeng" and "Meat and wine rot within the red gate, while corpses freeze on the road" would arouse the heroic spirit of the Timely Rain, I am afraid that Shi Naian would not be able to give a concrete answer. Also, as for the wicked thieves Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong, historical records and legends do not mention that they were "...generous, liked to help the helpless, and kept the Water Margin in their hands all day long, identifying themselves with Song Gongming..." etc. For example, what do Zhu De and Mao Zedong, etc., know about Habtermann, Suttermann, Wassermann, Henry Mann, and Thomas Mann? I am afraid they do not even understand what "literature" and what "mass language" are. ... Frankly speaking, not to mention in the junior high school history of our country, even in the Twenty-Four Histories, you can't find such an example.</p>
<p>Thinking about it in foreign countries, there is only one big rogue, Wei Long; but most of Wei Long's blind mess comes from legends and cannot be fully believed. As for Rousseau's influence on the French Revolution, it is also nonsense; in the era of Louis XVI in France, the people of Paris were in great chaos, and the number of refugees was increasing day by day. It was inevitable for them to rob bread, but Danton and Robespierre were some fierce figures, which goes without saying, but it has not been heard that these people talked about the philosophy of Diderot and Rousseau. Speaking of the demise of the Russian imperial family, frankly speaking, it has little to do with Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, or Gorky; if they did not suffer a defeat in the Far East and another defeat in Germany, they would not have collapsed so quickly. In short, no matter what form a country's politics takes, as long as it makes the masses have food to eat and everyone has nothing to say, and militarily it does not fail due to recklessness, endangering the country, even if writers come out and say a few irrelevant gossips, everyone will still find it annoying.</p>

<p>So they drank a lot of wine, and some people simply opened their throats and poured it down. (In fact, this cannot be considered a suitable reason, because their love for wine has always been well known.) Even those who do not have much money to buy a drunk (maybe even hungry for two meals) have to pretend to be tipsy, walk unsteadily, and deliberately speak vaguely. This is entirely for the sake of face.</p>
<p>Old Aksonov sat silently among his goods, squinting his eyes, half-sleeping and half-lying in the high-backed armchair. His red face, covered with wrinkles, was like an apple that had been exposed to the sun for three days, making people feel uncomfortable to look at. Moreover, he was dry and small, like a monkey, just lacking that sharp look. His eyes were not only not sharp, but always looked tired. No wonder, he had used them to look at the human world for seventy-four years. His hands were like chicken feet, with only a layer of skin wrapped around the bones, and the tendons were all sticking out.</p>
<p>Everyone who saw him felt even more terrified of old age. They asked themselves in their hearts: "Do I have to live to such a disgusting age?"</p>
<p>As for his goods, there were many kinds, with only one thing in common, and that was that they were old. Since it was an "old miscellaneous goods" shop, the oldness of the goods was natural, but the age of his goods was like that of his person, to the point where people could only sigh. Those goods included the most fashionable women's shawls in 1880, which had fifty years of history but had faded in color; there were also long leather boots with worn-off skin, old formal clothes and hats with countless holes eaten by insects, a gramophone that was made in the year it was invented, ironware that had turned yellow, a writing desk with one leg missing, many different things, some of which had never been seen by young people, and besides being surprised, they were also a little confused about their purpose.</p>

<p>— Ruo Wang</p>
<p>Dealing with the world requires an art, which no one denies anymore. However, there are all kinds of things in the world, so the art of dealing with the world is also very diverse. For example, if something needs to be scolded, then there is the "art of scolding people"; if it needs to be praised, there is also the "art of praising"; and love between men and women is even a most authentic art. If we were to discuss these categories separately, we could write a booklet priced at more than sixty cents, to say the least. If there is extra time, it is also possible to expand it into a monograph, but these are not something that little nobodies like us, who are respectfully called "contributors," are qualified to talk about, so let's stop here and get back to the main topic.</p>
<p>It is said that in the ancient palace-style high-rise building of the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge, a grand banquet began, with green lights and red wine – note: it is advisable to install green electric lights and drink red wine in summer – and white-collared guests filled the seats. If you, a little nobody, are also fortunately invited to attend, and it happens that you take the time to come, then you must not show the impatience of someone who has never eaten a big meal in your life, driving fast and gobbling up food. You must restrain your hunger a little and appear nonchalant, and even tell the waiter to say, "Today's steak is not as fresh as yesterday's." Or, after eating two bites, put it down and not eat it. In this way, others will think that you have eaten foreign bread abroad for several years, or at least they will always think that you are an old customer of the YMCA and dare not despise you.</p>
<p>So, is it over when you eat everything one by one? Of course not. So, what else do you do at the table? It all depends on your artistic skills and the situation at the time. If you feel the air is quiet, you can turn your mind two or three hundred times and find three or five jokes to tell, causing everyone at the table to spit out food and burst into laughter. The source of these jokes is best found among gentlemanly humorists, because this will show that you are also quite gentlemanly. But if you do not have any gentlemanly jokes to tell, you can also find another kind, but the people mentioned should still be found in high places, such as Hu Shih being caught visiting prostitutes in Beiping by his wife with bound feet, or Wu Zhihui running out of money on a boat and having to take off his gown and pawn it to the boatman.</p>
<p>If the air is mild and you need to talk about something a little more serious, then you see a friend of a certain writer, × someone, is also present, you can loudly ask, "Have you seen so-and-so these days?" If the answer is "No," then you immediately say, "If you see him, tell him that I have been a little uncomfortable these days and have rarely gone out." In this way, regardless of whether you know the writer or not, as long as you directly call him by his name, people will already know that you and the writer are old friends. And the matter of calling people by their names is really worth talking about.</p>
<p>If you call Zhang Xueliang the Young Marshal Zhang and Cai Yuanpei Cai Jiemin, people will guess that you have been a secretary.</p>
<p>Dropping a surname from a famous person's name, such as Dafu, Ziping, Fangwu, although people may not necessarily regard you as a celebrity, at least they will think that you are a friend of the celebrity. However, for celebrities who have no surname or whose surname is waived, you must add a surname to show that you are familiar with them, such as Bing Xin, call her Xie Bingxin, and Lu Yin, call her Huang Luyin.</p>
<p>If a friend has just been introduced to you, you will naturally ask him where he is from first. If he is from Nantong, you can casually say a person's name and ask, "Do you know someone named Zhang Jian in Nantong City?" Then you can talk about each other's academic interests. If the other person is studying art, you can talk about Liu Haisu, Xu Beihong, Lin Fengmian, etc. On the Western side, you can say a bunch of French names. If the other person is studying literature, then the material is even easier to pick up. If you feel that the conversation is empty, in the past few years you could have specially translated a little of the literary news translated by Zhao Jingshen and Yang Changxi as conversation material. Now you can also often look at the warrior literature on the butt of each newspaper to find out what lawsuit is being fought now.</p>
<p>If the other person likes to watch movies and talk about women, then you really can't finish talking for three days and three nights, so I have to put down the pen and not talk about it.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Old Zhong <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>Old Zhong is the oldest of our four colleagues. His surname is Zhong, and his mother named him Ah Gou. Later, when he entered school, the teacher gave him a more elegant name, called "Zuoting." Of course, this contains feudal ideas. His teacher came from the imperial examination, so he never forgot the well-known maxims that a scholar should have: "Studying is about the sages, and being an official is about the emperor and the country." "Zuoting" naturally hoped that he would be an official in the future and "assist the imperial court." Unfortunately, by the time he wanted to take the exam, the imperial examination had been abolished. Therefore, Old Zhong's dream of becoming an official finally had no "chance" to be realized, which is the most regrettable thing in his life!</p>
<p>However, people do not call him "Zuoting," but directly call him Old Zhong. These two words, Old Zhong, seem to be a very glorious title to him over the years, so when he meets people who call him Old Zhong, he is very proud. When talking to people, he often pats his chest with his left hand, raises his thumb with his right hand, points at his nose, and says:</p>
<p>"Hey! I, Old Zhong, am not bragging..." As he said this, he laughed triumphantly. The people listening to him also laughed so hard that they could not close their mouths.</p>
<p>Old Zhong's age is neither young nor old. He looks about forty years old. He himself has not counted it accurately. How old is he? We can only look at his face from the form. There is a saying in the countryside: "Don't ask the mother-in-law's age, but look at the mother-in-law's face." My answer also comes from looking at Old Zhong's face.</p>
<p>Although he is already in his forties, his chin is still so bald, like an old woman's face, unable to find a single whisker. It is not that he has the art of preserving his youth, but that every day as soon as he is free, he sits on a stool, takes a mirror, takes a pair of pliers, and clips it carefully, not stopping until there is not a single one left. Although he likes people to call him Old Zhong, he does not want people to say that he is old. If someone accidentally says that he is old, he will be unhappy; even, he will say with a strong tone of argument:</p>
<p>"Old! Who said that? You can only be considered old when you have a beard."</p>
<p>He has a wife, who also lives in Shanghai. She is a middle-aged woman who still has charm. Her relationship with him is not very good. She dresses up all day long and mixes in the amusement park. Her face is not very annoying, and her means of attracting bees and butterflies are even stronger, so</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>She has a good record of mixing. She also had two children, a boy and a girl, but because they were not properly raised, they both died early.</p>
<p>Old Zhong has been a clerk in our store for a full three years. He is very friendly among his colleagues, and people also treat him as a child. Even if someone scolds him or says a few words to him, he just laughs it off and does not get angry. He only goes home for one night each year, going back on the night of the winter solstice and returning to the store early the next morning. Friends who like to joke always dig at him a few words.</p>
<p>"Old Zhong! You haven't been home for a long time. Your wife has eloped with a gigolo!"</p>
<p>"I don't care, I don't care. Who has time to answer them?"</p>
<p>"Haha! Great amount! Old Zhong! Touch your vest and see, ha! ha! ha!" A burst of wild laughter and applause made two red clouds fly to Old Zhong's face. Finally, he walked away mumbling and avoided their embarrassing teasing.</p>
<p>According to what he told us himself: when he was twenty-three or four years old, he also played a romantic comedy once. Later, the little girl did not know why she changed her mind and fell in love with another young man. He had no ability to take a young girl's heart back from someone else's hand. All he had was melancholy and disappointment!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he said this story briefly and not in detail, so there is no way to write it down; otherwise, it would be a good material for the biography of Old Zhong.</p>
<h3 id="e252">In the Fiery Pit <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>The hour hand pointed to the intersecting midnight line, pushing open the only window in that attic room. The empty sky was so dark, no moonlight, no starlight to be seen at all. Even the Milky Way stretching across was nowhere to be found. A silence prevailed, seemingly pregnant with rain.</p>
<p>Naturally, in this remote place, the streets would not be bustling. The lamps, like a string of bright pearls, swayed with a strangely quiet leisure. Occasionally, one or two pedestrians passed by, walking slowly and deliberately.</p>
<p>Inadvertently, a wail was carried over.</p>
<p>| Don't hit me anymore, ah... I won't dare again...</p>
<p>The voice was very soft and tender, like that of a child. In that somber weather, how sorrowful it must be! Indeed, the tone of the wailing gradually grew louder and louder. The voice was so familiar. I realized that it was the neighbor's little Bao again, experiencing corporal punishment.</p>
<p>Sitting on a stool near the window, for some reason, countless sparks were flashing before my eyes. Suddenly, the sparks separated, and it was |</p>
<p>...Brown hair, a diminutive body, a mismatched face, tattered clothing, and sallow, emaciated skin, swollen and throbbing eyeballs! No, not just these, but terror, fear... depicting an extremely complex outline.</p>
<p>| Clap, clap, clap... In the stillness, the clear sound of footsteps entered my ears.</p>
<p>| Hmph, you're still slacking off. Be careful...</p>
<p>The tone must have been very angry, which could be discerned from the intonation.</p>
<p>Indeed, crying was only an echo under ordinary beatings. If the torture was intensified, this echo would have to be suppressed. So, what was being broadcast here? Hastened scolding and reprimands!</p>
<p>When the sun was setting the next day, I came back from the street and entered the alley, carefully looking around. But where was little Bao? Gone, gone.</p>
<p>Truly, I didn't understand why I was so concerned about her. A sense of longing filled my chest. Yes, perhaps she was seriously injured? Perhaps she was lying in bed? Or perhaps she couldn't even move? Maybe... various thoughts were swirling around, without stopping.</p>
<p>At night, I tossed and turned in bed, my imagination running wild like a movie. Suddenly, a girl emerged, her flesh so emaciated, her upper body naked, covered with streaks of blood. Her eyes were filled with tears, and her lips were constantly sobbing. The tragic state on her face!</p>
<p>Finally, she cried, the corners of her mouth twitching, trembling, uttering low, faint moans!</p>
<p>| Heaven, when will I be able to escape this raging fiery pit?</p>
<p>When the breeze passed, it carried some lingering fishy smell. Emotions were in turmoil, and there was no way to calm them down. I raised my head. The rain outside the window was falling patteringly, wetting the desk, wetting the window, strangely desolate, as if symbolizing the fate of little Bao.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Deep Night Sorrow <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The night is deep!</p>
<p>Everything is sinking into the lonely and desolate embrace of the night. The starlight has not flooded the azure sky. Coolness and darkness entwine the earth. The rustling of fallen leaves and the barking of dogs form the song of the night!</p>
<p>Gloom and coldness pervade the space. The earth is covered with a layer of gray gauze. Melancholy and indignation clog the chest. Pitiful! Dreams are again deeply knocking on my empty heart.</p>
<p>I seem to have knocked on every door of life, but every door is covered with the blood of innocent victims. I curse, I resent, I stare blankly at the crowd with a foolish smile. I curse these animals called humans, not knowing what monsters they are. They harm each other, they contradict each other, completely obliterating all that is truly "joy" and "suffering." Selfishness is displayed to the masses. Tightly embracing everyone's pathetic ambitions. Haha! In this ambition, trying to find "love" and "joy." How foolish! How pitiful!</p>
<p>The earth is still gloomy and dark. My whole body has a strong spasm. I swear that those who build their own happiness on the suffering of others should perish. Sadness and pain are intertwined in my chest. This long, long night has no dawn. The heavens and earth are still covered with a layer of dim haze.</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>My respected Editor:</p>
<p>I am nineteen years old this year. In the first month of my fourteenth year, my family sent me to work as an apprentice in the largest silk and cloth store in the neighboring county. It has been six years now. I don't know what I've learned in these six years. I always feel very bored and I'm afraid that there will be no hope in the future, so I want to change to work as a trainee in a bank. Because I think that if I enter a bank, I will definitely have time to handle matters and be able to study in the evenings, which will increase my knowledge. If I continue to waste my time in a cloth store, I asked my father to find a trainee position for me in a bank in July of this year, but it was not easy to find one for a while. I thought that rather than entering a bank as a trainee, I should leave the store early and make up for some academic subjects so that it would be more convenient for me to serve in the future. So I asked my father to let me go to Shanghai first to enter a vocational school to study business subjects. He agreed, so I gave up my six years of learning on July 20 and went to Shanghai. Now I live with relatives. When I arrived in Shanghai, I took the entrance exam for a vocational school. I took the first-year junior-level exam with an elementary school diploma. Fortunately, I managed to get into a vocational school. However, when my father heard that I had arrived in Shanghai, he immediately wrote a letter saying: "Since you have been studying commerce for six years, it is not convenient to go back to school. In my opinion, it is better to open a national goods store yourself. What do you think?" I had thought of this earlier, but because there is already a national goods company organization in the area and the market is sluggish, it is not easy to open a store. So I replied that I did not agree. But! I am now feeling "the infinite pain of changing careers!" Because if I go to school now and study from the first year of junior high school, I will be twenty-five years old when I graduate from high school. And my father cannot allow it. This is impossible in reality. If I study business for one or two years, I don't know if there will be a bank job for me after these one or two years. If I don't go to school, I can't go back, because I have already resigned as a shop assistant, and I swore when I was in the shop that I would not go back. If you ask me to go back, I will only jump into the Huangpu River! So these days, after thinking back and forth, I feel that the future is dark and terrible! For my own sake, I am determined not to work hard towards that bright road, so I presumptuously and urgently ask Mr. to indicate the needle of the south. I am infinitely grateful. The weather is very hot, and the writing is very rough. Please forgive me. I wish you</p>
<p>Safety 何士聰</p>
<p>Answer: I think your problem is not difficult to solve. You can temporarily study at the school, but on the other hand, you must quickly look for a job. If you don't want to be a clerk in an old-fashioned store anymore, ask someone to find you a position as a bank trainee or other position you want to do. Nowadays, there are no strict regulations on academic qualifications for banks to recruit trainees or junior staff. The main thing is to look at the results of the exam. And the exam seems to focus on work experience. Therefore, what you should pay attention to is to work hard to train your business skills and learn work skills. You don't necessarily have to graduate from school.</p>
<p>Secondly, from the perspective of learning, you don't necessarily have to go to school. Most of the real skills are experienced in actual life. Moreover, as long as you are determined to learn, you can also study book knowledge on your own. You don't necessarily have to "have a teacher to teach you." The only good thing about school compared to self-study is that you have one more diploma, which is not a guarantee. It cannot guarantee you a job. Therefore, there are many, many people who cannot find a job even after graduating from business school. School is not a job placement agency either.</p>
<p>In addition, I have two additional points of advice to give you: First, being a shop assistant now is certainly hopeless, but being a clerk in a new-style company or foreign firm is not much better. Therefore, you don't have to always "see that the mountain is higher than this one" and try to change careers. Second, you certainly need work skills to do things, but in this contradictory society, unemployment is very common. Even if you have the skills, you may not necessarily have a job. But you need to live, and think that life cannot be improved from now on, and the job will never be guaranteed. There are ways. As long as you recognize the social contradictions and the crux of the job problem, you will naturally know how you should work hard.</p>

<h3 id="e256">The Idiot (5) <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Bin</p>
<p>The idiot was silent, and tears rolled from the corners of his eyes onto his cheeks. But then he burst into a frantic song of vulgar and lewd mountain tunes, as if venting the infinite boredom in his chest.</p>
<p>Time passed day by day, and the long winter finally came to an end. The warm spring sun洒滿滿 the earth, like the smile of a holy maiden. Nature was covered with a brilliant new outfit, showing off the alluring coquettishness of a seductive slut, scattering an intoxicating and stifling warmth. The mysterious fire of youth was burning in every cell of every young man and woman, causing mysterious changes in their bodies and souls, increasing the happiness of the lucky and the sorrow of the unfortunate.</p>
<p>Just as the few apple-colored faces symbolizing countless common people were floating with smug smiles, dreaming rosy dreams, our long-term worker, who was eating for free without pay, was like a traveler who had been thirsty for a long time in the desert drinking poison, and was immediately dominated by an excitement that led to the path of death, causing him to forget the fear that an idiot should have, and forget the danger and death.</p>
<p>One night, the idiot's neighbor suddenly heard the chickens in her chicken coop screaming loudly, thinking that a tabby cat was dragging a chicken. She一边一边, lit a kerosene lamp, put on her clothes, opened the door, and rushed to the chicken coop to shine a light. One of the oldest hens that laid the most eggs was gone. She was as heartbroken as if she had lost her beloved son, and could not close her eyes all night.</p>
<p>The next day, just as dawn was breaking, before the idiot had gotten up, the housewife who had lost her chicken walked out of the bedroom door. Her eyes still had the shadows of tears from last night, and she searched every corner for signs of the hen being harmed. Suddenly, she saw the lost hen rushing out of the corner of the cattle pen where the idiot was staying, as if in a dream, and was startled. She immediately took a handful of rice and scattered it on the ground, coaxing it to come closer. She grabbed it in her arms like a treasure. The warm body of the chicken clearly spent the night in the quilt.</p>
<p>Like a toy that children were tired of playing with, the idiot once again gained people's surprised gaze and fierce laughter.</p>
<p>A few days later, a shocking news spread throughout the village. The news first came from the mouths of several cowherds, and then it spread throughout the village like wildfire. The women whispered to each other, as if someone's young cousin had secretly given birth to a child. The old women hummed "Amitabha" one after another, as if trying to use this "Amitabha" to resolve infinite sins. Some nosy men even specially composed a little song that was unbearable to the ears, and the children recited it to each other. The news was:</p>
<p>"The idiot is having an affair with the nun of the Auspicious Nunnery."</p>
<p>Speaking of the nun of this Auspicious Nunnery, she is also really pitiful. She was born in a farming family, and she had her fortune told twice since she was a child, and both times it was said that she would kill three husbands. When she was nine years old, she had smallpox, and her face was as pockmarked as the lid of a copper fire bucket, and she had the nickname "Full of Stars." So the pitiful girl's fate as a nun was naturally destined. She entered our Auspicious Nunnery when she was twelve years old, and it has been more than ten years now. Last year, she lost her old master, and now she is the only abbot of this nunnery.</p>
